Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in organic compounds. I remember that optical activity arises when a compound has chirality, meaning it has a chiral center or some other form that makes it non-superimposable on its mirror image. Oh right, and meso compounds don't have optical activity because they have internal planes of symmetry.

The question lists seven compounds, and I need to figure out how many of them are optically active. Let's go through each one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
Hmm, this is a geometric isomerism case. The molecule has a double bond with substituents on either side. Wait, but for a molecule to be chiral, it needs a chiral center, not just E/Z isomerism. Geometric isomerism doesn't imply chirality. So this compound probably doesn't have a chiral center. Let me think: the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So, for C1, the groups are Cl, CH2CH2, and two CH3 groups? Wait, wait. No, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me draw it. The structure is CH2Cl attached to a double bond with another group. Wait, maybe it's CH2Cl connected to the double bond, and the other side is CH(CH3) and something else. Wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, but with a double bond at position 1. Oh wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methyl would be Cl attached to C1, which is part of the double bond. So structure would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, the double bond is between C1 and C2, so the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. So the molecule is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, wait but the structure would actually be Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. So C1 has Cl, two CH2 groups? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the structure again. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would have Cl on C1, and a methyl group on C2. So structure: CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, no: but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon, so Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So the structure is Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 but with a double bond between C1 and C2? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, no, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would mean the Cl is on the first carbon, which is part of the double bond. So the structure is Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 but that's not possible with a double bond. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the numbering. Alternatively, the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So structure would be Cl-C(CH3)=CH-CH3? Wait, no, that's but-1-ene, so four carbons. So, it's Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, that can't be right because the double bond is between C1 and C2. So it's Cl on C1, which is double bonded to C2. So the molecule is Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's a single bond. Wait, no. Maybe the structure is Cl on C1, which is connected via double bond to C2, which has a methyl group. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? That can't be right because but-1-ene has the double bond starting at C1. So CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, because that's not a double bond. Wait, perhaps the correct structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. So C1: Cl, two CH3 groups? Wait, no. Maybe it's Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. No, that's five carbons. Wait, but it's butene, so four. So structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Wait, maybe the molecule is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, which would have the structure Cl on C1, which is double bonded to C2 (which has a methyl group), and then two CH2 groups. So the molecule is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, that's five carbons. Hmm, perhaps I'm not getting the structure right. Alternatively, perhaps it's Cl attached to C1 which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group and another group. So maybe the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, that's five carbons. Wait, but but-1-ene is four carbons. So perhaps it's Cl on the first carbon, then the double bond between C1 and C2. So structure is Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 but with a double bond. No, but that would be but-1-ene. So maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The key point is that the molecule has a double bond, but does it have a chiral center? If the double bond is between C1 and C2, and C2 has a methyl group, then C2 would have groups: CH3, CHCl (from C1), and two CH2 groups? Wait, no, perhaps there's no chiral center here. Because for a chiral center, you need four different groups. So if C2 is attached to Cl, CH3, and two CH2 groups, no, that's three groups, so not four. Wait, but the molecule is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, no, the double bond is there. Maybe I should think about whether this compound has any stereogenic centers. If not, then no optical activity. But wait, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If it's (Z) configuration, perhaps it's not chiral. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is planar and doesn't have a chiral center. So I think this compound doesn't have a chiral center, so no optical activity. So this one doesn't count.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**
This one sounds complex. The name suggests a bicyclic structure with substituents. Let me break it down. Methanoisobenzofuran would have a fused ring system. The substituent is chloromethylene (Cl-CH2-?), attached at position 8. The substituent is in the E configuration. Now, the question is whether this substituent creates a chiral center. Wait, the substituent is CH2Cl attached to the ring. But the E configuration would influence the geometry. But does the molecule have a chiral center? The positions 3a and 7a are specified as R and S configurations. So in the bicyclic system, those positions could be chiral centers. If the molecule has multiple chiral centers, it can be chiral. But also, the E configuration of the substituent might affect the overall structure. Wait, but E is about geometry around the double bond, which in this case is the chloromethylene group. So the substituent is E, meaning the substituents on either side of the double bond are opposite. But the main question is whether any carbon in the molecule is a chiral center. I think in this case, the bicyclic system may have chiral centers at 3a and 7a, which are labeled as R and S. So the molecule has chirality because of these centers. Additionally, the E configuration might not affect chirality but could impact other properties. So I think this compound is chiral and thus optically active.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**
Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. When it's 2,3-dimethyl, the substituents are on the two central carbons. The structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Now, each of the CH(CH3) groups is attached to what? Let's see: each of the central carbons has two CH3 groups, a COOH group, and a CH(CH3) group? Wait, no. For succinic acid, the carbons are 1: COOH, 2: CH2, 3: CH2, 4: COOH. So 2,3-dimethyl would make those CH2 groups into CH(CH3). So each of the 2 and 3 carbons would be CH(CH3). Now, each of these carbons has what substituents? For carbon 2: a methyl group, two CH2 groups (from the succinic acid chain), and a COOH group? Wait, no. Wait, the structure is:

HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So the central two carbons are each bonded to a methyl group, and each is connected to the succinic acid chain.

Wait, for carbon 2, the groups attached are:

- COOH (from carbon 1),
- CH(CH3) (carbon 3),
- two CHs (since it's a CH group; wait, no. Wait, each of the central carbons in 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is CH(CH3). So each has:

Carbon 2: connected to COOH (from C1), a methyl group, and two CH(CH3) groups? No, wait. Carbon 2 is CH(CH3), so it has:

- COOH (from C1) as one substituent,
- CH(CH3) (C3) as another,
- two CH2 groups? No, wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me imagine the structure:

The molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Each of the central carbons (C2 and C3) is CH(CH3). So each of these carbons is connected to:

- One CH3 group,
- Two CH2 groups (from the chain),
- One COOH group (for C2) or another CH(CH3) (for C3).

Wait, that's not clear. Let me think about the substituents on each central carbon. For C2:

- One methyl group,
- One COOH group (from C1),
- Two CH(CH3) groups? No, wait, C2 is connected to C1 (which is COOH), C3 (which is CH(CH3)), and two H's? No, because if it's CH(CH3), then it's bonded to three groups: one methyl, one C1 (COOH), and one C3 (CH(CH3)), and maybe another H or something else.

Wait, perhaps I should think about whether these carbons have four different substituents. For C2: the groups attached are COOH (from C1), CH(CH3) (C3), a methyl group, and a hydrogen. Wait, no. Wait, the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each CH(CH3) has:

- One methyl group,
- One COOH (on C2) or another CH(CH3) (on C3),
- Two CH2 groups? No, wait, no, the CH(CH3) is connected to a COOH on one side and another CH(CH3) on the other. So for C2, substituents are:

- COOH (from C1),
- CH(CH3) (from C3),
- methyl,
- and what else? Wait, the CH(CH3) has two more substituents. Wait, no, each CH is bonded to three other groups. So maybe I'm getting it wrong. Let me draw it:

HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) is CH(CH3). So each has:

- Two single bonds to other carbons (C1 for C2, and C3 for C3),
- One methyl group,
- And one hydrogen.

Wait, wait, that's not possible. Because for a CH(CH3), the structure is CH2(CH3), but I'm getting confused. Oh wait, no. Wait, in a carbon chain, each CH2 group has two H's. But in 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, each of the middle carbons is CH(CH3). So each has one methyl group, two CH2 groups? No, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So for C2: it's connected to C1 (COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), a methyl group, and a hydrogen. So the groups are:

- COOH,
- CH(CH3) (C3),
- CH3,
- H.

So four different groups: yes. Similarly, for C3, same groups: COOH (from C4?), no, wait, C3 is connected to C2 (CH(CH3)), C4 (COOH), methyl, and H. So each of these carbons (C2 and C3) has four different substituents, making them chiral centers. But wait, in the molecule, C2 and C3 each have the same substituents, so would that lead to a plane of symmetry? Let me see: the molecule is symmetric around the center. Because if you mirror it, C2 and C3 are mirror images. So if the configuration is (2R,3S), is there a plane of symmetry? Wait, if the two chiral centers are mirror images of each other, then the molecule might be a meso compound. Because in meso compounds, even though there are chiral centers, the molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

So, for example, tartaric acid is a meso compound because the two chiral centers are mirror images, leading to a plane of symmetry. So in this case, if the two chiral centers are R and S, respectively, would the molecule be meso?

Wait, let's think about the configurations. The compound is (2R,3S). So C2 is R, C3 is S. Let me imagine the configuration. If the molecule is symmetric, like meso-tartaric acid, then the configurations would be opposite, leading to a plane of symmetry. So in that case, the molecule would be meso and not chiral, hence no optical activity. But wait, in tartaric acid, the two stereocenters are R and S, so it's a meso compound. So in our case, if the molecule has this configuration, it's a meso compound. So no optical activity. Hmm, but I need to confirm whether the molecule is a meso compound.

Wait, in succinic acid, the two central carbons are symmetrical. So if each has a methyl group, and their configurations are opposite, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry between them, making it meso. So (2R,3S) would make it meso. Therefore, no optical activity.

Wait, but wait. The question says (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. So in this case, the two stereocenters have opposite configurations. So the molecule is a meso compound. Therefore, it's not chiral and doesn't show optical activity.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**
Same structure as the previous one, but configurations are both R. So each chiral center is R. Now, in this case, the molecule would not have a plane of symmetry because the configurations are the same. So the two chiral centers would not be mirror images. Therefore, the molecule is chiral and would exhibit optical activity. So this compound counts.

Wait, but let me think again. If both are R, then the molecule would lack symmetry. Because the two chiral centers are the same, the mirror image would have both S, which is different from the original. So the molecule would be chiral, hence optically active.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**
This is a cyclohexanol derivative with an ene group. The structure is cyclohexane ring with an -OH group on C1, and a double bond between C3 and C4. The configuration is R. So the question is whether this creates a chiral center. The OH is on C1, which is attached to three other carbons and an OH group. So the groups on C1 would be:

- OH,
- two CH2 groups (from adjacent carbons in the ring),
- and another CH group from the ring.

Wait, no. The cyclohexane ring has six carbons. C1 has the OH. The ring structure around C1 would have two adjacent CH2 groups (C2 and C6), and the C3 is part of a double bond. Wait, the structure is cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. So the double bond is between C3 and C4. So C1 has adjacent carbons C2 and C6, each of which is CH2. So C1 would have:

- OH,
- C2 (CH2),
- C6 (CH2),
- and the ring (C3, which is part of a double bond, so it's a CH group).

Wait, so four substituents: OH, CH2 (C2), CH2 (C6), and CH (C3, which is double bonded to C4). So all four substituents are different, making C1 a chiral center. Because the configuration is R, this makes the molecule chiral. So it will exhibit optical activity.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**
This has three hydroxyl groups on the cyclohexane ring. Each is on C1, C3, and C5. Let's see if the molecule has a plane of symmetry. The positions are 1,3,5, all s configuration. Now, the molecule is cyclohexane with three OH groups. Let me think about whether it has a plane of symmetry. If all three OHs are in the same configuration (s), does that create a symmetric arrangement?

In cyclohexane, if the substituents are on 1,3,5 positions, they are symmetrically placed. If all three are (s), then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Let me imagine the chair conformation. If each OH is axial and in the same direction (say, all axial down), then the molecule might be symmetric. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can be superimposed on its mirror image, making it achiral.

Wait, if all three OH groups are in the same configuration, like (1s,3s,5s), then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry passing through the center of the ring. Because each OH is opposite to another. So the molecule would be a meso compound, making it achiral. So no optical activity.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think: If the three OHs are in 1,3,5 positions, and all are s (say, all axial down), then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. So when you mirror it, it would look the same, making it achiral. So this is a meso compound and hence not optically active.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**
The structure is a cyclopentyl group attached to C1 of butanone. Butanone is (CH3)2CO, but here it's butan-1-one, which is CH3CH2CH2CO-. So butan-1-one is CH2CH2CH2-CO-? Wait, no. Wait, butan-1-one would be:

R-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no. Wait, butan-1-one is (from the IUPAC nomenclature) the ketone on the first carbon. So structure is:

CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that would be pentan-2-one. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Wait, butan-1-one would have the ketone on C1. So the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that's not possible because the carbonyl is on the end. So the molecule would be O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, which is a ketone. But in this case, the substituents are 1-cyclopentyl and 3-methyl. So structure is:

O=C-CH2-C(CH3)(something) ?

Wait, the full structure is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So butan-1-one is (CH2)3CO. So the carbonyl is on C1. So substituents are:

C1: CO group,
C2: attached to C1 and C3,
C3: attached to C2 and C4,
C4: attached to C3 and the cyclopentyl group.

Wait, no. Let me write it correctly. Butan-1-one is CH3CH2CH2CO. So the structure is:

Cyclopentyl group attached to C1 (CO), and a methyl group attached to C3.

Wait, but butan-1-one is (CH2)3CO. So the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that's pentan-1-one, right? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, butan-1-one would be:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-?

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH2CH2... No, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the substituents. The molecule is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So the carbonyl is on C1. So C1 is connected to:

- The cyclopentyl group,
- C2 (which is CH2),
- And two more substituents? Wait, no, butan-1-one is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

So the carbonyl is on the first carbon, which is connected to three CH2 groups and a cyclopentyl group? Wait, that can't be right. Let me think: butan-1-one is (CH2)3CO. So the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. So in this case, the substituents are:

On C1 (the CO position): a cyclopentyl group.

On C3: a methyl group.

Wait, but butan-1-one is four carbons in the chain, with the ketone on C1. So the chain is: CO, CH2, CH2, CH2, CH3? Wait, that's five carbons. Maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

Cyclopentyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon (C1), and a methyl group on C3.

So the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-cyclopentyl? No, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The molecule is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. The butanone is four carbons, with the ketone on C1. So the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-Cyclopentyl?

No, but butanone has four carbons. So perhaps:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CH(CH2-cyclopentyl)-something. Hmm, maybe it's better to think about the substituents. The carbonyl is on C1, which is attached to a cyclopentyl group. Then, C2 is attached to C1 and C3. C3 has a methyl group and is attached to C2 and C4. C4 is attached to C3 and the next carbon. Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-...

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key point is whether there's a chiral center here. Let me look at the carbons:

- C1: carbonyl carbon (O=C), attached to cyclopentyl, and two CH2 groups. So no, because a carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O, so it can't be a chiral center.

- C2: attached to C1 (O=C-CH2-), C3, and two H's? So groups: O=C-CH2-, CH(CH3), and two H's. So for C2, substituents: CH2-CO, CH(CH3), two H's. So only three different groups; not a chiral center.

- C3: attached to C2, C4, a methyl group, and another substituent. Wait, let me see: C3 is CH(CH3). Attached to C2 (CH2-), C4 (CH2-), methyl, and another H? So substituents: CH2- (from C2), CH2- (from C4), CH3, and H. So four different groups? Wait, CH2- (two different directions), but same substituent. So substituents on C3: CH2-CO (from C2?), CH2- (from C4), CH3, and H. So four different groups? No, because the two CH2 groups are same in structure but attached in different directions. So for C3, the substituents are:

- CH2-CO (from C2),
- CH2- (from C4),
- CH3,
- and H.

Are any two substituents the same? The CH2- groups are attached to different parts of the molecule, but each is a CH2 group. So, for C3, are the two CH2 groups considered the same substituent? No, because one is connected to C2 (which is connected to the carbonyl), and the other is connected to C4 (which is connected to C5 and the cyclopentyl group). So the substituents are all different: CH2-CO, CH2-C4, CH3, H. Therefore, C3 is a chiral center. So this compound has a chiral center and is optically active.

So now, let's tally up the compounds that are optically active:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No
2. (3aR,7aS,E)-...: Yes
3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: No (meso)
4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Yes
5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Yes
6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: No (meso)
7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Yes

So, the ones that are optically active are numbers 2,4,5,7. That's four compounds.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check each compound.

Compound 2: We thought it's chiral because of the R and S configurations and the E geometry. So yes.

Compound 4: Definitely yes, as it's not meso.

Compound 5: Yes, because the C1 is a chiral center.

Compound 7: Yes, because C3 is chiral.

So that's four. So the answer should be D)4.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for chirality. A compound is optically active if it has a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or another form of asymmetry, such as being a meso compound with internal symmetry. Meso compounds are achiral despite having stereocenters because they have a plane of symmetry.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**  
   This compound has a double bond with geometric isomerism (E/Z), but it lacks a chiral center. The carbon atoms in the molecule do not have four different substituents. Therefore, it is **not optically active**.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**  
   This bicyclic compound has chiral centers at positions 3a and 7a, as indicated by their R and S configurations. The E geometry of the chloromethylene group does not affect chirality. Thus, this compound is **optically active**.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   Succinic acid has two central carbons, each bonded to a methyl group, a carboxylic acid group, and two other carbons. The configurations at C2 (R) and C3 (S) are mirror images, creating a plane of symmetry in the molecule. This makes it a meso compound, which is **not optically active**.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   Similar to the previous compound, the two central carbons are chiral centers. However, since both carbons have the same configuration (R), the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and is therefore **optically active**.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**  
   The hydroxyl group on C1 is bonded to three different groups (two adjacent carbons in the ring and a double-bonded carbon in the ring). This makes C1 a chiral center. Thus, this compound is **optically active**.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**  
   The three hydroxyl groups are positioned symmetrically on the cyclohexane ring at C1, C3, and C5. The molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Therefore, it is **not optically active**.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**  
   The carbon at position 3 is bonded to four different groups: a methyl group, a cyclopentyl group, a CH2 group, and a hydrogen. This makes it a chiral center. Thus, this compound is **optically active**.

### Conclusion:
The compounds that exhibit optical activity are numbers 2, 4, 5, and 7. Therefore, the total number of optically active compounds is **4**.

**Answer: D**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in organic compounds. I remember that optical activity arises when a compound has chirality, meaning it has a chiral center or some other form that makes it non-superimposable on its mirror image. Oh right, and meso compounds don't have optical activity because they have internal planes of symmetry.

The question lists seven compounds, and I need to figure out how many of them are optically active. Let's go through each one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
Hmm, this is a geometric isomerism case. The molecule has a double bond with substituents on either side. Wait, but for a molecule to be chiral, it needs a chiral center, not just E/Z isomerism. Geometric isomerism doesn't imply chirality. So this compound probably doesn't have a chiral center. Let me think: the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So, for C1, the groups are Cl, CH2CH2, and two CH3 groups? Wait, wait. No, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me draw it. The structure is CH2Cl attached to a double bond with another group. Wait, maybe it's CH2Cl connected to the double bond, and the other side is CH(CH3) and something else. Wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, but with a double bond at position 1. Oh wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methyl would be Cl attached to C1, which is part of the double bond. So structure would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, the double bond is between C1 and C2, so the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. So the molecule is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, wait but the structure would actually be Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. So C1 has Cl, two CH2 groups? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the structure again. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would have Cl on C1, and a methyl group on C2. So structure: CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, no: but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon, so Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So the structure is Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 but with a double bond between C1 and C2? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, no, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would mean the Cl is on the first carbon, which is part of the double bond. So the structure is Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 but that's not possible with a double bond. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the numbering. Alternatively, the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So structure would be Cl-C(CH3)=CH-CH3? Wait, no, that's but-1-ene, so four carbons. So, it's Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, that can't be right because the double bond is between C1 and C2. So it's Cl on C1, which is double bonded to C2. So the molecule is Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's a single bond. Wait, no. Maybe the structure is Cl on C1, which is connected via double bond to C2, which has a methyl group. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? That can't be right because but-1-ene has the double bond starting at C1. So CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, because that's not a double bond. Wait, perhaps the correct structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. So C1: Cl, two CH3 groups? Wait, no. Maybe it's Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. No, that's five carbons. Wait, but it's butene, so four. So structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Wait, maybe the molecule is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, which would have the structure Cl on C1, which is double bonded to C2 (which has a methyl group), and then two CH2 groups. So the molecule is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, that's five carbons. Hmm, perhaps I'm not getting the structure right. Alternatively, perhaps it's Cl attached to C1 which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group and another group. So maybe the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, that's five carbons. Wait, but but-1-ene is four carbons. So perhaps it's Cl on the first carbon, then the double bond between C1 and C2. So structure is Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 but with a double bond. No, but that would be but-1-ene. So maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The key point is that the molecule has a double bond, but does it have a chiral center? If the double bond is between C1 and C2, and C2 has a methyl group, then C2 would have groups: CH3, CHCl (from C1), and two CH2 groups? Wait, no, perhaps there's no chiral center here. Because for a chiral center, you need four different groups. So if C2 is attached to Cl, CH3, and two CH2 groups, no, that's three groups, so not four. Wait, but the molecule is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, no, the double bond is there. Maybe I should think about whether this compound has any stereogenic centers. If not, then no optical activity. But wait, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If it's (Z) configuration, perhaps it's not chiral. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is planar and doesn't have a chiral center. So I think this compound doesn't have a chiral center, so no optical activity. So this one doesn't count.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**
This one sounds complex. The name suggests a bicyclic structure with substituents. Let me break it down. Methanoisobenzofuran would have a fused ring system. The substituent is chloromethylene (Cl-CH2-?), attached at position 8. The substituent is in the E configuration. Now, the question is whether this substituent creates a chiral center. Wait, the substituent is CH2Cl attached to the ring. But the E configuration would influence the geometry. But does the molecule have a chiral center? The positions 3a and 7a are specified as R and S configurations. So in the bicyclic system, those positions could be chiral centers. If the molecule has multiple chiral centers, it can be chiral. But also, the E configuration of the substituent might affect the overall structure. Wait, but E is about geometry around the double bond, which in this case is the chloromethylene group. So the substituent is E, meaning the substituents on either side of the double bond are opposite. But the main question is whether any carbon in the molecule is a chiral center. I think in this case, the bicyclic system may have chiral centers at 3a and 7a, which are labeled as R and S. So the molecule has chirality because of these centers. Additionally, the E configuration might not affect chirality but could impact other properties. So I think this compound is chiral and thus optically active.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**
Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. When it's 2,3-dimethyl, the substituents are on the two central carbons. The structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Now, each of the CH(CH3) groups is attached to what? Let's see: each of the central carbons has two CH3 groups, a COOH group, and a CH(CH3) group? Wait, no. For succinic acid, the carbons are 1: COOH, 2: CH2, 3: CH2, 4: COOH. So 2,3-dimethyl would make those CH2 groups into CH(CH3). So each of the 2 and 3 carbons would be CH(CH3). Now, each of these carbons has what substituents? For carbon 2: a methyl group, two CH2 groups (from the succinic acid chain), and a COOH group? Wait, no. Wait, the structure is:

HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So the central two carbons are each bonded to a methyl group, and each is connected to the succinic acid chain.

Wait, for carbon 2, the groups attached are:

- COOH (from carbon 1),
- CH(CH3) (carbon 3),
- two CHs (since it's a CH group; wait, no. Wait, each of the central carbons in 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is CH(CH3). So each has:

Carbon 2: connected to COOH (from C1), a methyl group, and two CH(CH3) groups? No, wait. Carbon 2 is CH(CH3), so it has:

- COOH (from C1) as one substituent,
- CH(CH3) (C3) as another,
- two CH2 groups? No, wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me imagine the structure:

The molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Each of the central carbons (C2 and C3) is CH(CH3). So each of these carbons is connected to:

- One CH3 group,
- Two CH2 groups (from the chain),
- One COOH group (for C2) or another CH(CH3) (for C3).

Wait, that's not clear. Let me think about the substituents on each central carbon. For C2:

- One methyl group,
- One COOH group (from C1),
- Two CH(CH3) groups? No, wait, C2 is connected to C1 (which is COOH), C3 (which is CH(CH3)), and two H's? No, because if it's CH(CH3), then it's bonded to three groups: one methyl, one C1 (COOH), and one C3 (CH(CH3)), and maybe another H or something else.

Wait, perhaps I should think about whether these carbons have four different substituents. For C2: the groups attached are COOH (from C1), CH(CH3) (C3), a methyl group, and a hydrogen. Wait, no. Wait, the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each CH(CH3) has:

- One methyl group,
- One COOH (on C2) or another CH(CH3) (on C3),
- Two CH2 groups? No, wait, no, the CH(CH3) is connected to a COOH on one side and another CH(CH3) on the other. So for C2, substituents are:

- COOH (from C1),
- CH(CH3) (from C3),
- methyl,
- and what else? Wait, the CH(CH3) has two more substituents. Wait, no, each CH is bonded to three other groups. So maybe I'm getting it wrong. Let me draw it:

HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) is CH(CH3). So each has:

- Two single bonds to other carbons (C1 for C2, and C3 for C3),
- One methyl group,
- And one hydrogen.

Wait, wait, that's not possible. Because for a CH(CH3), the structure is CH2(CH3), but I'm getting confused. Oh wait, no. Wait, in a carbon chain, each CH2 group has two H's. But in 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, each of the middle carbons is CH(CH3). So each has one methyl group, two CH2 groups? No, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So for C2: it's connected to C1 (COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), a methyl group, and a hydrogen. So the groups are:

- COOH,
- CH(CH3) (C3),
- CH3,
- H.

So four different groups: yes. Similarly, for C3, same groups: COOH (from C4?), no, wait, C3 is connected to C2 (CH(CH3)), C4 (COOH), methyl, and H. So each of these carbons (C2 and C3) has four different substituents, making them chiral centers. But wait, in the molecule, C2 and C3 each have the same substituents, so would that lead to a plane of symmetry? Let me see: the molecule is symmetric around the center. Because if you mirror it, C2 and C3 are mirror images. So if the configuration is (2R,3S), is there a plane of symmetry? Wait, if the two chiral centers are mirror images of each other, then the molecule might be a meso compound. Because in meso compounds, even though there are chiral centers, the molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

So, for example, tartaric acid is a meso compound because the two chiral centers are mirror images, leading to a plane of symmetry. So in this case, if the two chiral centers are R and S, respectively, would the molecule be meso?

Wait, let's think about the configurations. The compound is (2R,3S). So C2 is R, C3 is S. Let me imagine the configuration. If the molecule is symmetric, like meso-tartaric acid, then the configurations would be opposite, leading to a plane of symmetry. So in that case, the molecule would be meso and not chiral, hence no optical activity. But wait, in tartaric acid, the two stereocenters are R and S, so it's a meso compound. So in our case, if the molecule has this configuration, it's a meso compound. So no optical activity. Hmm, but I need to confirm whether the molecule is a meso compound.

Wait, in succinic acid, the two central carbons are symmetrical. So if each has a methyl group, and their configurations are opposite, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry between them, making it meso. So (2R,3S) would make it meso. Therefore, no optical activity.

Wait, but wait. The question says (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. So in this case, the two stereocenters have opposite configurations. So the molecule is a meso compound. Therefore, it's not chiral and doesn't show optical activity.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**
Same structure as the previous one, but configurations are both R. So each chiral center is R. Now, in this case, the molecule would not have a plane of symmetry because the configurations are the same. So the two chiral centers would not be mirror images. Therefore, the molecule is chiral and would exhibit optical activity. So this compound counts.

Wait, but let me think again. If both are R, then the molecule would lack symmetry. Because the two chiral centers are the same, the mirror image would have both S, which is different from the original. So the molecule would be chiral, hence optically active.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**
This is a cyclohexanol derivative with an ene group. The structure is cyclohexane ring with an -OH group on C1, and a double bond between C3 and C4. The configuration is R. So the question is whether this creates a chiral center. The OH is on C1, which is attached to three other carbons and an OH group. So the groups on C1 would be:

- OH,
- two CH2 groups (from adjacent carbons in the ring),
- and another CH group from the ring.

Wait, no. The cyclohexane ring has six carbons. C1 has the OH. The ring structure around C1 would have two adjacent CH2 groups (C2 and C6), and the C3 is part of a double bond. Wait, the structure is cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. So the double bond is between C3 and C4. So C1 has adjacent carbons C2 and C6, each of which is CH2. So C1 would have:

- OH,
- C2 (CH2),
- C6 (CH2),
- and the ring (C3, which is part of a double bond, so it's a CH group).

Wait, so four substituents: OH, CH2 (C2), CH2 (C6), and CH (C3, which is double bonded to C4). So all four substituents are different, making C1 a chiral center. Because the configuration is R, this makes the molecule chiral. So it will exhibit optical activity.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**
This has three hydroxyl groups on the cyclohexane ring. Each is on C1, C3, and C5. Let's see if the molecule has a plane of symmetry. The positions are 1,3,5, all s configuration. Now, the molecule is cyclohexane with three OH groups. Let me think about whether it has a plane of symmetry. If all three OHs are in the same configuration (s), does that create a symmetric arrangement?

In cyclohexane, if the substituents are on 1,3,5 positions, they are symmetrically placed. If all three are (s), then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Let me imagine the chair conformation. If each OH is axial and in the same direction (say, all axial down), then the molecule might be symmetric. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can be superimposed on its mirror image, making it achiral.

Wait, if all three OH groups are in the same configuration, like (1s,3s,5s), then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry passing through the center of the ring. Because each OH is opposite to another. So the molecule would be a meso compound, making it achiral. So no optical activity.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think: If the three OHs are in 1,3,5 positions, and all are s (say, all axial down), then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. So when you mirror it, it would look the same, making it achiral. So this is a meso compound and hence not optically active.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**
The structure is a cyclopentyl group attached to C1 of butanone. Butanone is (CH3)2CO, but here it's butan-1-one, which is CH3CH2CH2CO-. So butan-1-one is CH2CH2CH2-CO-? Wait, no. Wait, butan-1-one would be:

R-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no. Wait, butan-1-one is (from the IUPAC nomenclature) the ketone on the first carbon. So structure is:

CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that would be pentan-2-one. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Wait, butan-1-one would have the ketone on C1. So the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that's not possible because the carbonyl is on the end. So the molecule would be O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, which is a ketone. But in this case, the substituents are 1-cyclopentyl and 3-methyl. So structure is:

O=C-CH2-C(CH3)(something) ?

Wait, the full structure is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So butan-1-one is (CH2)3CO. So the carbonyl is on C1. So substituents are:

C1: CO group,
C2: attached to C1 and C3,
C3: attached to C2 and C4,
C4: attached to C3 and the cyclopentyl group.

Wait, no. Let me write it correctly. Butan-1-one is CH3CH2CH2CO. So the structure is:

Cyclopentyl group attached to C1 (CO), and a methyl group attached to C3.

Wait, but butan-1-one is (CH2)3CO. So the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that's pentan-1-one, right? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, butan-1-one would be:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-?

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH2CH2... No, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the substituents. The molecule is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So the carbonyl is on C1. So C1 is connected to:

- The cyclopentyl group,
- C2 (which is CH2),
- And two more substituents? Wait, no, butan-1-one is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

So the carbonyl is on the first carbon, which is connected to three CH2 groups and a cyclopentyl group? Wait, that can't be right. Let me think: butan-1-one is (CH2)3CO. So the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. So in this case, the substituents are:

On C1 (the CO position): a cyclopentyl group.

On C3: a methyl group.

Wait, but butan-1-one is four carbons in the chain, with the ketone on C1. So the chain is: CO, CH2, CH2, CH2, CH3? Wait, that's five carbons. Maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

Cyclopentyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon (C1), and a methyl group on C3.

So the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-cyclopentyl? No, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The molecule is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. The butanone is four carbons, with the ketone on C1. So the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-Cyclopentyl?

No, but butanone has four carbons. So perhaps:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CH(CH2-cyclopentyl)-something. Hmm, maybe it's better to think about the substituents. The carbonyl is on C1, which is attached to a cyclopentyl group. Then, C2 is attached to C1 and C3. C3 has a methyl group and is attached to C2 and C4. C4 is attached to C3 and the next carbon. Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-...

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key point is whether there's a chiral center here. Let me look at the carbons:

- C1: carbonyl carbon (O=C), attached to cyclopentyl, and two CH2 groups. So no, because a carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O, so it can't be a chiral center.

- C2: attached to C1 (O=C-CH2-), C3, and two H's? So groups: O=C-CH2-, CH(CH3), and two H's. So for C2, substituents: CH2-CO, CH(CH3), two H's. So only three different groups; not a chiral center.

- C3: attached to C2, C4, a methyl group, and another substituent. Wait, let me see: C3 is CH(CH3). Attached to C2 (CH2-), C4 (CH2-), methyl, and another H? So substituents: CH2- (from C2), CH2- (from C4), CH3, and H. So four different groups? Wait, CH2- (two different directions), but same substituent. So substituents on C3: CH2-CO (from C2?), CH2- (from C4), CH3, and H. So four different groups? No, because the two CH2 groups are same in structure but attached in different directions. So for C3, the substituents are:

- CH2-CO (from C2),
- CH2- (from C4),
- CH3,
- and H.

Are any two substituents the same? The CH2- groups are attached to different parts of the molecule, but each is a CH2 group. So, for C3, are the two CH2 groups considered the same substituent? No, because one is connected to C2 (which is connected to the carbonyl), and the other is connected to C4 (which is connected to C5 and the cyclopentyl group). So the substituents are all different: CH2-CO, CH2-C4, CH3, H. Therefore, C3 is a chiral center. So this compound has a chiral center and is optically active.

So now, let's tally up the compounds that are optically active:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No
2. (3aR,7aS,E)-...: Yes
3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: No (meso)
4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Yes
5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Yes
6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: No (meso)
7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Yes

So, the ones that are optically active are numbers 2,4,5,7. That's four compounds.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check each compound.

Compound 2: We thought it's chiral because of the R and S configurations and the E geometry. So yes.

Compound 4: Definitely yes, as it's not meso.

Compound 5: Yes, because the C1 is a chiral center.

Compound 7: Yes, because C3 is chiral.

So that's four. So the answer should be D)4.


To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for chirality. A compound is optically active if it has a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or another form of asymmetry, such as being a meso compound with internal symmetry. Meso compounds are achiral despite having stereocenters because they have a plane of symmetry.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**  
   This compound has a double bond with geometric isomerism (E/Z), but it lacks a chiral center. The carbon atoms in the molecule do not have four different substituents. Therefore, it is **not optically active**.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**  
   This bicyclic compound has chiral centers at positions 3a and 7a, as indicated by their R and S configurations. The E geometry of the chloromethylene group does not affect chirality. Thus, this compound is **optically active**.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   Succinic acid has two central carbons, each bonded to a methyl group, a carboxylic acid group, and two other carbons. The configurations at C2 (R) and C3 (S) are mirror images, creating a plane of symmetry in the molecule. This makes it a meso compound, which is **not optically active**.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   Similar to the previous compound, the two central carbons are chiral centers. However, since both carbons have the same configuration (R), the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and is therefore **optically active**.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**  
   The hydroxyl group on C1 is bonded to three different groups (two adjacent carbons in the ring and a double-bonded carbon in the ring). This makes C1 a chiral center. Thus, this compound is **optically active**.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**  
   The three hydroxyl groups are positioned symmetrically on the cyclohexane ring at C1, C3, and C5. The molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Therefore, it is **not optically active**.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**  
   The carbon at position 3 is bonded to four different groups: a methyl group, a cyclopentyl group, a CH2 group, and a hydrogen. This makes it a chiral center. Thus, this compound is **optically active**.

### Conclusion:
The compounds that exhibit optical activity are numbers 2, 4, 5, and 7. Therefore, the total number of optically active compounds is **4**.
