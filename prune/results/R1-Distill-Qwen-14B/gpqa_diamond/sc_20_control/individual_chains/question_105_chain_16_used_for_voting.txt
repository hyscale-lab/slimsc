Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me read through it again and break it down step by step.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of its surface. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. Because of these spots, when the star rotates, the brightness changes, which can look like an exoplanet transit. The question is asking: what exoplanet radius would cause the same brightness variation as these spots do?

Hmm. So the main idea here is about photometric variation—how much the brightness changes. For an exoplanet, the dip in brightness is when it transits in front of the star. The amplitude of that dip depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. For the spots, the dip is because when the spots rotate into and out of view, they block some of the star's light. Since they're cooler, when they're on the side facing us, the star appears slightly dimmer.

Wait, but wait. The star's spots are causing a dip in brightness because they're darker, right? So when the spots are on the visible side, the total light we receive decreases. But exoplanets cause a dip because they block some starlight. So the problem is comparing the two effects.

The way to approach this is to calculate the relative change in brightness (the amplitude of the light curve) caused by the spots and then find what planet radius would cause the same change.

First, let's think about the star with spots. The effective temperature is Teff = 6000K. The spots are cooler by 1000K, so their temperature is 5000K. The filling factor is 20%, meaning that 20% of the hemisphere is covered by spots. So the total area of the spots is 0.2 times the area of a hemisphere.

Wait, but a hemisphere is half the star's surface. So for the entire star, the area is 4πR². So a hemisphere would be 2πR². So the area covered by spots is 0.2 * (2πR²) = 0.4π R².

The flux from the star without spots is the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR² σ T_eff^4. The flux per unit area is σ T^4. 

When the spots are on the hemisphere, the flux from the star is reduced. The spots contribute less flux than the surrounding areas. The total flux from the star when the spots are on view would be the normal flux from the non-spotty regions plus the flux from the spots.

Wait, actually, when the spots are on the side we see, their area contributes less. So the total flux would be the flux without spots minus the difference between the spot flux and the normal flux over the spotted area.

Let me try to calculate the change in flux.

The star's total flux without spots is F_total = σ T_eff^4 * 4π R². But when spots are present on half the star (but only one hemisphere is spotty, so perhaps the spots are on the near side when observed), the flux is F = (Area without spots * T_eff^4 + Area with spots * T_spot^4) * σ.

Wait, no. The star's surface is divided into regions. For the hemisphere that's spotty, 20% of its area is spots, 80% is normal. So the flux from the hemisphere is (0.8 * T_eff^4 + 0.2 * T_spot^4) multiplied by the area per unit (since it's per unit area, the actual area comes in when calculating total).

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the average flux per unit area for the hemisphere.

The hemisphere's surface area is 2π R². The spots cover 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². So the flux from the hemisphere is:

Flux_hemi = (0.8 * T_eff^4 + 0.2 * T_spot^4) * 2π R² * σ.

Wait, no, because each part of the surface emits according to its own temperature. So the total flux is the sum of each area times its T^4.

Alternatively, the flux from the entire star without spots is σ T_eff^4 * 4π R².

When the spots are on the near side, the flux is:

Flux = ( (1 - 0.2) * (Teff^4) + 0.2 * (T_spot^4) ) * 2π R² * σ + (other hemisphere, which is not spotted) * σ Teff^4 * 2π R².

Wait, no. The other hemisphere isn't spotted, so it's emitting at Teff. So when the star is viewed such that one hemisphere is spotted, the total flux is:

Flux = ( (1 - 0.2) * Teff^4 + 0.2 * T_spot^4 ) * (2π R² σ ) + (2π R² σ Teff^4 )

Wait, that can't be right because (1-0.2) is 0.8, so 0.8 * Teff^4 * 2π R² σ for the spotted hemisphere. Plus the other hemisphere, which is 2π R² σ Teff^4. So total is (0.8 + 1.0) * Teff^4 * 2π R² σ + 0.2 * T_spot^4 * 2π R² σ.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me rephrase.

The entire star's surface area is 4π R². When the spotted hemisphere is visible, 20% of that hemisphere is spots. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R². The rest of the hemisphere is 1.6π R².

So the total flux when the spots are visible is:

Flux = [ (1.6π R²) * T_eff^4 + (0.4π R²) * T_spot^4 ] * σ 

Plus the other hemisphere, which is 2π R² * T_eff^4 * σ.

Wait, no. No, when the star rotates so that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the other hemisphere is the far side, which we can't see. So the flux is only from the near hemisphere (spotted) and the far hemisphere (normal). But wait, the far hemisphere is on the other side, so does its flux affect our observation? No, because we can only see the near side. So the total flux we receive is just the flux from the near hemisphere.

Wait, that makes more sense. So when the near hemisphere is spotted, the observed flux is from that hemisphere. The far side doesn't contribute because it's not facing us.

So the flux when the spots are on the near side is:

Flux_spotty = (0.8 * T_eff^4 + 0.2 * T_spot^4) * 2π R² σ.

The average flux when the star is not showing the spots (or when the spots are on the far side) is the full hemisphere flux, which is T_eff^4 * 2π R² σ.

Wait, no. The average flux is when the spots are on either the near or the far side, but when the star is viewed such that the non-spotted hemisphere is near, then the flux is higher.

Wait, maybe the star's brightness variation is the difference between when the spots are on the near side and when they're on the far side.

So, the maximum flux is when the non-spotty hemisphere is visible: (2π R² σ T_eff^4).

The minimum flux is when the spotty hemisphere is visible: (0.8 * T_eff^4 + 0.2 * T_spot^4) * 2π R² σ.

So the change in flux is (F_max - F_min) / F_max.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the variation in brightness is the difference between the spotted and non-spotted states.

Let me compute the two fluxes.

Maximum flux (F_max) is when the non-spotted hemisphere is visible: F_max = 2π R² σ T_eff^4.

Minimum flux (F_min) is when the spotty hemisphere is visible: F_min = (0.8 T_eff^4 + 0.2 T_spot^4) * 2π R² σ.

So the change in flux ΔF is F_min - F_max? Or F_max - F_min?

Wait, actually, when the spots are visible, the flux is lower, so F_min is less than F_max. So the amplitude of the dip is (F_max - F_min) / F_max.

Right, because when the spots are on the near side, the flux is lower, causing a dip. The amplitude is the relative decrease.

So let's compute that.

First, compute F_max and F_min.

F_max = 2π R² σ T_eff^4.

F_min = 2π R² σ [ 0.8 T_eff^4 + 0.2 (T_spot)^4 ]

So ΔF = F_max - F_min = 2π R² σ [ T_eff^4 - (0.8 T_eff^4 + 0.2 T_spot^4) ]

= 2π R² σ [ 0.2 T_eff^4 - 0.2 T_spot^4 ]

= 0.2 * 2π R² σ (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4)

So the relative change is (ΔF) / F_max.

Which is [0.2 * 2π R² σ (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4)] / [2π R² σ T_eff^4 ]

Simplify:

= 0.2 (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4) / T_eff^4

= 0.2 [ 1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4 ]

Given that T_spot = 5000K, T_eff =6000K.

So T_spot / T_eff = 5/6 ≈0.8333.

Let me compute (5/6)^4:

(5^4)/(6^4) = 625 / 1296 ≈ 0.48225.

So 1 - 0.48225 ≈ 0.51775.

Multiply by 0.2: 0.2 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.10355.

So the relative change is approximately 10.355%.

Wait, but wait. No, because the star's temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 5000K.

Wait, actually, the calculation is correct.

So the amplitude is about 10.355% dip.

Now, the question is, what exoplanet radius would cause the same amplitude in the light curve.

So, for a planet transiting the star, the dip in brightness is (R_planet / R_star)^2.

Because the area blocked is π R_planet^2, and the star's area is π R_star^2. As the star's flux is proportional to its area, the dip is (R_planet/R_star)^2.

So to get a dip of ~10.355%, we set:

(R_planet / R_star)^2 = 0.10355.

Taking square root:

R_planet / R_star ≈ sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218.

Wait, that's approximately 0.32.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32.

But wait, I thought the relative change was about 10.35%? Let me double-check.

Wait, earlier I had 0.2 * (1 - (5/6)^4) ≈ 0.2 * (1 - 0.48225) = 0.2 * 0.51775 = 0.10355, which is 10.355% dip.

So the planet would cause a dip of (R_p / R_*)^2 = 0.10355. So R_p/R_* = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218, which is ~0.32. That's option D.

But wait, let me think again about the calculation. Did I make a mistake in computing F_min and F_max?

Wait, F_max is when the non-spotty (normal) hemisphere is facing us. The flux is 2π R² σ T_eff^4.

F_min is when the spotty hemisphere is facing us. The flux is 2π R² σ (0.8 T_eff^4 + 0.2 T_spot^4).

So the dip is F_max - F_min = 2π R² σ [ T_eff^4 - (0.8 T_eff^4 + 0.2 T_spot^4) ].

Which simplifies to 2π R² σ [0.2 (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4) ]

So the dip is 0.2 * (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4) / T_eff^4 * 100% as a relative change.

So 0.2 * [1 - (T_spot^4)/(T_eff^4)] * 100%.

So the exact calculation:

T_spot =5000, T_eff=6000.

(5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 = (625)/(1296) ≈ 0.482253.

So 1 - 0.482253 = 0.517747.

Multiply by 0.2: 0.2 * 0.517747 ≈0.103549.

So 10.3549% dip.

So the planet's dip would be (R_p/R_*)^2 = 0.103549.

So R_p/R_* = sqrt(0.103549) ≈ 0.3218, which is about 0.32. So option D.

But wait, another thought. The problem states that the star is observed to have a brightness variation due to the spots. When the spots are on the near side, the flux is lower, so the dip is F_max - F_min. So the amplitude is (F_max - F_min)/F_max.

Which is correct, as I did earlier.

But wait, another way to think about it is that the flux from the star is F = σ T^4 * (Area), and when the spots are present, the effective T is lower.

Wait, maybe I should compute the effective temperature of the star when the spots are on the near side.

The effective temperature of the star can be thought of as the temperature that an equivalent blackbody would have, which gives the same total flux.

So the total flux when the spots are present is F = F_hemi_spotty + F_other_hemi.

Wait, but wait, when the star rotates so that the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the far side is the other hemisphere, which is normal. But we can't see the far side, can we? No, because only the near side is visible. So the flux is only from the near side, which includes the spots.

Wait, no. Wait, the star is a sphere. When we look at the star, we see the near hemisphere. The far hemisphere doesn't contribute because the light from it would go away from us. So the flux when the near hemisphere is spotty is F = (0.8 * T_eff^4 + 0.2 * T_spot^4) * (2π R²) σ.

The other case is when the near hemisphere is normal, so F = T_eff^4 * 2π R² σ.

So the amplitude is (F_normal - F_spotty)/F_normal.

Which is ( [T_eff^4 - (0.8 T_eff^4 + 0.2 T_spot^4) ] * 2π R² σ ) / (T_eff^4 * 2π R² σ )

Simplify:

= [ T_eff^4 (1 - 0.8 - 0.2 (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )) ] / T_eff^4

= 1 - 0.8 - 0.2 (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )

= 0.2 (1 - (T_spot^4/T_eff^4) )

Which is the same as before.

So yes, the dip is 10.355% approximately.

So the planet's radius would have to cause the same dip, which is (R_p/R_*)^2 = 0.10355 → R_p/R_* ≈ 0.32.

So the answer should be option D, ~0.32.

To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the described star with dark spots, we analyze the photometric amplitude caused by the spots and compare it to the amplitude caused by a planet transit.

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: \( R_{\text{star}} = R_{\odot} \) (same as the Sun).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%.
   - Spots are cooler: \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation**:
   - The star's total flux without spots is \( F_{\text{max}} = 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \), where the flux is calculated for the near (non-spotty) hemisphere.
   - When the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is reduced:
     \[
     F_{\text{min}} = 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma \left( 0.8 T_{\text{eff}}^4 + 0.2 T_{\text{spot}}^4 \right),
     \]
     where 80% of the hemisphere emits at \( T_{\text{eff}} \) and 20% emits at \( T_{\text{spot}} \).

3. **Amplitude of Brightness Variation**:
   The relative change in brightness is:
   \[
   \text{Amplitude} = \frac{F_{\text{max}} - F_{\text{min}}}{F_{\text{max}}}.
   \]
   Substituting the expressions for \( F_{\text{max}} \) and \( F_{\text{min}} \):
   \[
   \text{Amplitude} = 0.2 \left( 1 - \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \right).
   \]
   Using \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \), we calculate:
   \[
   \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 = \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 = \frac{625}{1296} \approx 0.48225.
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   \text{Amplitude} = 0.2 \left( 1 - 0.48225 \right) = 0.2 \times 0.51775 = 0.10355 \, \text{or} \, 10.355\%.
   \]

4. **Exoplanet Radius for the Same Amplitude**:
   The brightness variation caused by a planet transit is proportional to the square of the planet-to-star radius ratio:
   \[
   \text{Amplitude} = \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2.
   \]
   Setting this equal to the amplitude caused by the spots:
   \[
   \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.10355.
   \]
   Taking the square root:
   \[
   \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.10355} \approx 0.3218.
   \]
   Therefore, the planet's radius relative to the star is approximately \( 0.32 \).

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star's spots is approximately **0.32**.
