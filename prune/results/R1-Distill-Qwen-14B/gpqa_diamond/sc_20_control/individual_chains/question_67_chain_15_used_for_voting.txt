Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about two electrons in p orbitals. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question is about the coupled angular momentum state. The state is given as |l₁, l₂, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Oh wait, right, each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l. For a p orbital, l is 1. So both l₁ and l₂ are 1.

Now, the total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and m is -1. So when they talk about measuring L₁z and L₂z, which are the z-components of each electron's orbital angular momentum, I need to find the probability that both measurements give -ħ.

Wait, let me remember. The eigenvalues for L_z (orbital angular momentum) are mħ. So for each electron, L_z can be -ħ, 0, or +ħ since l=1. So m can be -1, 0, +1.

So the question is the joint probability of both electrons having L_z eigenvalues of -ħ. So each would have m=-1. So the product would be (-ħ) for each, but I'm looking for the probability of getting -ħ for both.

But the state is given as a coupled state. I think the coupled state is a combination of the product states of the individual states. Let me think about how the coupled states work.

The coupled state |l₁, l₂, l, m> can be expressed as a linear combination of the product states |l₁, m₁> |l₂, m₂>, where m₁ + m₂ = m_total, which in this case is -1. But wait, in the coupled state, the sum of m₁ and m₂ must give m, which is -1 here.

But wait, our total m is -1, but each electron's m can be anything as long as their sum is -1. So the state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of all possible m1 and m2 where m1 + m2 = -1. But wait, the maximum m when l=2 is 2, but each m_i can be -1, 0, +1.

So the possible (m1, m2) pairs that sum to m=-1 are:

- m1 = -1, m2 = 0 → sum is -1
- m1 = 0, m2 = -1 → sum is -1

Wait, are there any others? Let me see. l1 and l2 are 1, so m1 can be -1, 0, +1. Same for m2. So m1 + m2 = -1.

Possible pairs:
(-1, 0) → sum -1
(0, -1) → sum -1
Wait, is that all? Because 1 + (-2) is -1, but m2 can't be -2 since l2=1. So m2 can't be less than -1. So only those two possibilities.

So the coupled state is a sum of these two product states. So in the coupled basis, the state |1,1,2,-1> would be expressed as a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

But wait, the coefficients depend on how the states are coupled. The general approach is to construct the state using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. For combining two l=1 states into total l=2.

But I'm not too clear on the exact coefficients, but perhaps I can recall that when combining two p orbitals, the state with total l=2 and m=2 would be |1,1> |1,1>, right? Because m1 + m2 = 2 only when both are +1.

Similarly, for m=1, the state is a combination of (|1,1> |1,0> + |1,0> |1,1>)/sqrt(2), maybe? Or perhaps I should look at the pattern.

Wait, I think the coupled state |l=2, m=2> is just |1,1> |1,1>, because that's the only way to get m=2.

For |l=2, m=1>, it's a combination of |1,1> |1,0> and |1,0> |1,1>:

|1,1> |1,0> + |1,0> |1,1> all divided by sqrt(2), perhaps.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's |1,1> |1,0> multiplied by sqrt(2) times some CG coefficient. I think the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for two l=1 states to make l=2 are known.

Wait, the general formula is that the state |l1, m1> |l2, m2> is expressed in terms of |L, M> states, but in reverse, the |L, M> state is a sum of |l1, m1> |l2, m2> with m1 + m2 = M.

So for our case, L=2, M=-1.

The possible (m1, m2) pairs are (-1, 0) and (0, -1). So the state would be a combination of these two product states.

The question is, what is the coefficient for each, and how does that determine the probability when we measure L1z and L2z.

Because the coupled state is a linear combination of these product states, the probabilities are the squares of the absolute values of their coefficients.

So for each product state |m1, m2>, the coefficient determines the probability.

So to find the probability of both electrons having m1=-1 and m2=-1, which would require their L_z to be -ħ each, but wait, m1 and m2 are -1 and 0, or 0 and -1 in the possible terms.

Wait, no. Because in the coupled state |L=2, M=-1>, the possible m1 and m2 are (-1,0) and (0,-1). There's no term where both are -1 because (-1) + (-1) = -2, which is less than M=-1. So, the state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of two product states: |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

So the state is:

|1,1,2,-1> = a * |m1=-1, m2=0> + b * |m1=0, m2=-1>

The coefficients a and b can be determined by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

Wait, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining two l=1 states into L=2 are known. Let me think.

The general formula is that the state |L, M> is a sum of |l1, m1> |l2, m2> with m1 + m2 = M, multiplied by the CG coefficients.

In our case, L=2, M=-1.

The possible m1 and m2 are (-1,0) and (0,-1), as discussed.

The CG coefficient for each term is given by:

The CG coefficient for (m1, m2) → M is:

< l1 m1 l2 m2 | L M > 

Which, for our case, L=2, M=-1.

I think the CG coefficients for combining two l=1 states into L=2 are as follows:

For m = 2 → only (1,1) → coefficient is 1.

For m=1 → (1,0) and (0,1), each with coefficient 1/sqrt(2).

Wait, no. Wait, for l=1 and l'=1, the CG coefficients for L=2:

For M=2: 1 |1,1> |1,1> → coefficient 1.

For M=1: (|1,1> |1,0> + |1,0> |1,1>)/sqrt(2) → coefficients 1/sqrt(2) each.

Wait, no, wait. Wait the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding two angular momenta l1 and l2 to get L.

From what I remember, the CG coefficients for l1=1, l2=1 → L=2:

For M=2: only (1,1) → coefficient 1.

For M=1: (1,0) and (0,1) → coefficients 1/sqrt(2) each.

For M=0: (1,-1) and (0,0) and (-1,1) ? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, when l1 and l2 are 1, the possible M values for L=2 are -2, -1, 0, 1, 2.

For M=2: only (1,1) → coefficient 1.

M=1: |1,0> |1,1> + |1,1> |1,0>, but perhaps each term has a coefficient of 1/sqrt(2).

M=0: combinations of (1,-1) and (0,0), but wait, perhaps it's more complex. Wait, maybe for M=0 in L=2, the state is (|1, -1> |1, 1> + |1, 0> |1, 0> + |1, 1> |1, -1> ) multiplied by some factor.

But wait, perhaps I should look for a table. Since I can't look it up, perhaps I'll try to recall.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of ladder operators. The raising and lowering operators can help construct the states.

Alternatively, considering that the state |1,1,2,-1> is a superposition of the two product states |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

But I need to find the coefficients for these terms.

Wait, I think the CG coefficients for two l=1 states combining to L=2:

For M=-1, the state is a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

The CG coefficient for each term is... Well, for M=−1, the state is:

sqrt(1/2) (|m1=−1, m2=0> + |m1=0, m2=−1> )

Wait, no, perhaps the coefficient is 1/sqrt(2) for each term.

So the coupled state would be:

|1,1,2,−1> = (1/sqrt(2)) |m1=−1, m2=0> + (1/sqrt(2)) |m1=0, m2=−1>

So each term has a coefficient of 1/sqrt(2).

Now, the problem is, when we measure L₁z and L₂z, what is the probability that both are -ħ.

But in the coupled state, the possible product states are those where m1 + m2 = -1. So the possible product states in the expansion are |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

In neither of these product states do both m1 and m2 equal -1. Because if m1=-1, m2 must be 0 (so sum is -1), and vice versa.

So in the coupled state |1,1,2,-1>, there's no component where both electrons have m=-1. So the probability of both electrons having m=-1 (i.e., both L_z = -ħ) is zero.

Wait, but let me think again. The coupled state is a linear combination of product states. Each product state has specific m1 and m2 values. For our case, the product states are (-1, 0) and (0, -1), each with equal amplitude (1/sqrt(2)). Therefore, the probability for each product state is |1/sqrt(2)|² = 1/2.

So when you measure the individual m's, the possible outcomes are either m1=-1 and m2=0, or m1=0 and m2=-1. There is no term where both are -1.

Therefore, the probability that both L1z and L2z are -ħ is zero.

So looking at the options, the answer should be D) 0.

The problem involves two electrons in a coupled angular momentum state described as $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>$. Here, $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons, while $l = 2$ and $m = -1$ are the total angular momentum quantum number and its projection along the z-axis, respectively. The task is to determine the joint probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$.

The eigenvalues of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ are determined by the quantum numbers $m_1$ and $m_2$, which can take values $-1, 0, +1$ for $l = 1$. The total angular momentum projection $m$ is the sum of $m_1$ and $m_2$, i.e., $m = m_1 + m_2$. For the given coupled state $|1,1,2,-1>$, the possible $(m_1, m_2)$ pairs that satisfy $m_1 + m_2 = -1$ are:

1. $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, 0)$
2. $(m_1, m_2) = (0, -1)$

Thus, the coupled state $|1,1,2,-1>$ is a linear combination of these two product states:

\[
|1,1,2,-1> = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} |m_1=-1, m_2=0> + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} |m_1=0, m_2=-1>.
\]

The coefficients of the product states are $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ each, and the probability of each product state is the square of the absolute value of its coefficient, which is $\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}$.

To find the joint probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$, we need both $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. However, in the coupled state $|1,1,2,-1>$, there is no component where both $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. The only possible $(m_1, m_2)$ pairs are $(-1, 0)$ and $(0, -1)$. Therefore, the probability of both $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$ is zero.

Thus, the joint probability of measuring $L_{1z} = -\hbar$ and $L_{2z} = -\hbar$ is:

\[
\boxed{0}
\]

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about two electrons in p orbitals. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question is about the coupled angular momentum state. The state is given as |l₁, l₂, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Oh wait, right, each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l. For a p orbital, l is 1. So both l₁ and l₂ are 1.

Wait, let me remember. The eigenvalues for L_z (orbital angular momentum) are mħ. So for each electron, L_z can be -ħ, 0, or +ħ since l=1. So m can be -1, 0, +1.

So the question is the joint probability of both electrons having L_z eigenvalues of -ħ. So each would have m=-1. So the product would be (-ħ) for each, but I'm looking for the probability of getting -ħ for both.

But the state is given as a coupled state. I think the coupled state is a combination of the product states of the individual states. Let me think about how the coupled states work.

So the possible (m1, m2) pairs that sum to m=-1 are:

- m1 = -1, m2 = 0 → sum is -1
- m1 = 0, m2 = -1 → sum is -1

Wait, are there any others? Let me see. l1 and l2 are 1, so m1 can be -1, 0, +1. Same for m2. So m1 + m2 = -1.

Possible pairs:
(-1, 0) → sum -1
(0, -1) → sum -1
Wait, is that all? Because 1 + (-2) is -1, but m2 can't be -2 since l2=1. So m2 can't be less than -1. So only those two possibilities.

So the coupled state is a sum of these two product states. So in the coupled basis, the state |1,1,2,-1> would be expressed as a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

But wait, the coefficients depend on how the states are coupled. The general approach is to construct the state using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. For combining two l=1 states into total l=2.

Similarly, for m=1, the state is a combination of (|1,1> |1,0> + |1,0> |1,1>)/sqrt(2), maybe? Or perhaps I should look at the pattern.

Wait, I think the coupled state |l=2, m=2> is just |1,1> |1,1>, because that's the only way to get m=2.

For |l=2, m=1>, it's a combination of |1,1> |1,0> and |1,0> |1,1>:

|1,1> |1,0> + |1,0> |1,1> all divided by sqrt(2), perhaps.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's |1,1> |1,0> multiplied by sqrt(2) times some CG coefficient. I think the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for two l=1 states to make l=2 are known.

Wait, the general formula is that the state |l1, m1> |l2, m2> is expressed in terms of |L, M> states, but in reverse, the |L, M> state is a sum of |l1, m1> |l2, m2> with m1 + m2 = M.

So for our case, L=2, M=-1.

The possible (m1, m2) pairs are (-1, 0) and (0, -1). So the state would be a combination of these two product states.

The question is, what is the coefficient for each, and how does that determine the probability when we measure L1z and L2z.

Because the coupled state is a linear combination of these product states, the probabilities are the squares of the absolute values of their coefficients.

So for each product state |m1, m2>, the coefficient determines the probability.

So to find the probability of both electrons having m1=-1 and m2=-1, which would require their L_z to be -ħ each, but wait, m1 and m2 are -1 and 0, or 0 and -1 in the possible terms.

Wait, no. Because in the coupled state |L=2, M=-1>, the possible m1 and m2 are (-1,0) and (0,-1). There's no term where both are -1 because (-1) + (-1) = -2, which is less than M=-1. So, the state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of two product states: |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

So the state is:

|1,1,2,-1> = a * |m1=-1, m2=0> + b * |m1=0, m2=-1>

The coefficients a and b can be determined by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

Wait, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining two l=1 states into L=2 are known. Let me think.

The general formula is that the state |L, M> is a sum of |l1, m1> |l2, m2> with m1 + m2 = M, multiplied by the CG coefficients.

In our case, L=2, M=-1.

The possible m1 and m2 are (-1,0) and (0,-1), as discussed.

The CG coefficient for each term is given by:

The CG coefficient for (m1, m2) → M is:

< l1 m1 l2 m2 | L M > 

Which, for our case, L=2, M=-1.

I think the CG coefficients for combining two l=1 states into L=2 are as follows:

For m = 2 → only (1,1) → coefficient is 1.

For m=1 → (1,0) and (0,1), each with coefficient 1/sqrt(2).

Wait, no. Wait, for l=1 and l'=1, the CG coefficients for L=2:

For M=2: 1 |1,1> |1,1> → coefficient 1.

For M=1: (|1,1> |1,0> + |1,0> |1,1>)/sqrt(2) → coefficients 1/sqrt(2) each.

Wait, no, wait. Wait the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding two angular momenta l1 and l2 to get L.

From what I remember, the CG coefficients for l1=1, l2=1 → L=2:

For M=2: only (1,1) → coefficient 1.

For M=1: (1,0) and (0,1) → coefficients 1/sqrt(2) each.

For M=0: (1,-1) and (0,0) and (-1,1) ? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, when l1 and l2 are 1, the possible M values for L=2 are -2, -1, 0, 1, 2.

For M=2: only (1,1) → coefficient 1.

M=1: |1,0> |1,1> + |1,1> |1,0>, but perhaps each term has a coefficient of 1/sqrt(2).

M=0: combinations of (1,-1) and (0,0), but wait, perhaps it's more complex. Wait, maybe for M=0 in L=2, the state is (|1, -1> |1, 1> + |1, 0> |1, 0> + |1, 1> |1, -1> ) multiplied by some factor.

But wait, perhaps I should look for a table. Since I can't look it up, perhaps I'll try to recall.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of ladder operators. The raising and lowering operators can help construct the states.

Alternatively, considering that the state |1,1,2,-1> is a superposition of the two product states |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

But I need to find the coefficients for these terms.

Wait, I think the CG coefficients for two l=1 states combining to L=2:

For M=-1, the state is a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

The CG coefficient for each term is... Well, for M=−1, the state is:

sqrt(1/2) (|m1=−1, m2=0> + |m1=0, m2=−1> )

Wait, no, perhaps the coefficient is 1/sqrt(2) for each term.

So the coupled state would be:

|1,1,2,−1> = (1/sqrt(2)) |m1=−1, m2=0> + (1/sqrt(2)) |m1=0, m2=−1>

So each term has a coefficient of 1/sqrt(2).

Now, the problem is, when we measure L₁z and L₂z, what is the probability that both are -ħ.

But in the coupled state, the possible product states are those where m1 + m2 = -1. So the possible product states in the expansion are |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

In neither of these product states do both m1 and m2 equal -1. Because if m1=-1, m2 must be 0 (so sum is -1), and vice versa.

So in the coupled state |1,1,2,-1>, there's no component where both electrons have m=-1. So the probability of both electrons having m=-1 (i.e., both L_z = -ħ) is zero.

Wait, but let me think again. The coupled state is a linear combination of product states. Each product state has specific m1 and m2 values. For our case, the product states are (-1, 0) and (0, -1), each with equal amplitude (1/sqrt(2)). Therefore, the probability for each product state is |1/sqrt(2)|² = 1/2.

So when you measure the individual m's, the possible outcomes are either m1=-1 and m2=0, or m1=0 and m2=-1. There is no term where both are -1.

Therefore, the probability that both L1z and L2z are -ħ is zero.

So looking at the options, the answer should be D) 0.


The problem involves two electrons in a coupled angular momentum state described as $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>$. Here, $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons, while $l = 2$ and $m = -1$ are the total angular momentum quantum number and its projection along the z-axis, respectively. The task is to determine the joint probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$.

The eigenvalues of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ are determined by the quantum numbers $m_1$ and $m_2$, which can take values $-1, 0, +1$ for $l = 1$. The total angular momentum projection $m$ is the sum of $m_1$ and $m_2$, i.e., $m = m_1 + m_2$. For the given coupled state $|1,1,2,-1>$, the possible $(m_1, m_2)$ pairs that satisfy $m_1 + m_2 = -1$ are:

1. $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, 0)$
2. $(m_1, m_2) = (0, -1)$

Thus, the coupled state $|1,1,2,-1>$ is a linear combination of these two product states:

\[
|1,1,2,-1> = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} |m_1=-1, m_2=0> + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} |m_1=0, m_2=-1>.
\]

The coefficients of the product states are $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ each, and the probability of each product state is the square of the absolute value of its coefficient, which is $\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}$.

To find the joint probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$, we need both $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. However, in the coupled state $|1,1,2,-1>$, there is no component where both $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. The only possible $(m_1, m_2)$ pairs are $(-1, 0)$ and $(0, -1)$. Therefore, the probability of both $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$ is zero.

Thus, the joint probability of measuring $L_{1z} = -\hbar$ and $L_{2z} = -\hbar$ is:

\[
\boxed{0}
\]

Answer: D
