Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term and the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, I remember that paramagnetic coupling involves the interaction between the magnetic moment of an electron and an external magnetic field. The term is usually part of the Hamiltonian in quantum mechanics when you include magnetic effects. The basic form of the Hamiltonian for this coupling is H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment and B is the magnetic field.

The magnetic moment μ for an electron is given by μ = -gμ_B S, where g is the gyromagnetic ratio, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and S is the spin operator. But wait, since we're taking the expectation value, and for a state with well-defined m (the magnetic quantum number), the spin part would be straightforward.

The energy from this term would then be something like <H> = -gμ_B <S_z> B. Since S_z is m times ħ/2, but when taking the expectation value for a state |m>, <S_z> is m(ħ/2). So putting that together, <H> = -gμ_B B m(ħ/2), but wait, the sign might vary depending on conventions, but the magnitude would be proportional to m and B.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "for small values of m." So m is small, like maybe m=0, ±1, ±2, etc., but not a larger number. So the paramagnetic term would scale with m, but if m is small, that term might be smaller compared to other energies.

Now, the other part is the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom. The question gives the wavelength λ as 0.4861 micrometers. I think that's the wavelength of the Balmer series, like the H-alpha line, which is about 656 nm but wait, the given λ is 0.4861 µm, which is 486.1 nm. That's the Balmer series as well, but wait, the Balmer lines are in the visible range. Oh, wait, 0.4861 µm is 486 nm, which is blue-green, corresponding to the Balmer-alpha emission line, right?

The energy transition ΔE can be calculated using the photon energy formula: E = hc/λ. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is about 3e8 m/s. The wavelength λ is 486.1 nm, which is 486.1e-9 meters.

So calculating ΔE: E = (6.626e-34 Js * 3e8 m/s) / (486.1e-9 m). Let me compute that. Let's see, 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25. Divide by 486.1e-9 m, which is 4.861e-7. So 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 = approximately 4.088e-19 J.

Wait, but sometimes energies are expressed in electron volts. Let me convert that to eV for easier comparison. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 4.088e-19 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 2.55 eV. Hmm, that's a rough estimate, but it's a typical energy scale for hydrogen transitions.

Now, what about the paramagnetic coupling term? The energy from the magnetic field would be on the order of μ_B * B. Let me compute that. The Bohr magneton μ_B is about 9.274e-24 J/T. So if B is 1 T, then μ_B * B is 9.274e-24 J. That's an energy term of roughly 9.27e-24 J.

Wait, but the transition energy ΔE is about 4.09e-19 J, which is way larger than 9.27e-24 J. So the paramagnetic term is much smaller. But wait, I have to consider the values more precisely.

Wait, the paramagnetic term would be something like the Zeeman effect for the electron spin. The energy shift due to the magnetic field is given by ΔE_param = μ_B * B * m, but since m is small, like m=1, then it's approximately 9.27e-24 J * 1 * 1. So that's 9.27e-24 J, as above.

Comparing to the transition energy ΔE of about 4.09e-19 J, then the paramagnetic term is much smaller. So in the problem statement, the question is to compare the paramagnetic coupling term's expectation value <H> with the transition energy ΔE.

But wait, the options are about whether <H> is much greater, much less, etc., than ΔE. So if <H> is ~1e-23 J and ΔE is ~1e-19 J, then <H> is much less than ΔE. So the paramagnetic term is negligible compared to the transition energy.

Wait, but wait another thing. Did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me double-check the numbers. Let me compute ΔE again.

λ = 0.4861 µm = 486.1e-9 m.

E = hc/λ = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (486.1e-9) = ?

Calculate numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Denominator: 486.1e-9 m = 4.861e-7 m.

So E = 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 = approximately (1.9878 / 4.861) * 1e-18 J.

1.9878 / 4.861 is roughly 0.4089, so E ≈ 0.4089e-18 J = 4.089e-19 J. Correct.

The paramagnetic term is μ_B * B * m. Let's take m=1 for maximum effect. So μ_B is 9.27e-24 J/T, B=1 T, so 9.27e-24 * 1 *1 = 9.27e-24 J.

So the ratio is 9.27e-24 / 4.089e-19 ≈ 2.26e-5. So the paramagnetic term is about 0.00226% of the transition energy. So it's way smaller.

Therefore, the paramagnetic term is much less than the transition energy. So the correct option would be C) <H> << ΔE.

Wait, but the question says "paramagnetic coupling term with transition energy ΔE of Hydrogen atom". Oh wait, I think I might have confused the paramagnetic term with the Zeeman effect. Wait, does the paramagnetic coupling term refer to the spin-orbit coupling or the Zeeman effect?

Wait, no. Paramagnetic coupling is when an atom is placed in an external magnetic field and the magnetic moments (like spin) interact with it. So the energy is the Zeeman term, which is the paramagnetic coupling term.

So in that case, the calculation holds. The paramagnetic term is way smaller than the transition energy.

Wait, but wait another thing: The transition energy in the hydrogen atom is on the order of eV, like 10 eV for some transitions. Wait, no, wait the Balmer series is about 100 nm to 400 nm, and the transition energy for n=2 to n=1 is about 10.2 eV, but wait, 0.486 micrometers is about n=2 to n=1? Wait, no, wait the Balmer series is transitions to n=2. So if the given λ is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486 nm, that's H-alpha, which is n=3 to n=2, giving a transition energy of about 1.89 eV.

Wait, I think my earlier calculation got 2.55 eV, but perhaps I miscalculated. Let me check what the exact energy is for λ=486 nm.

The Rydberg constant R is about 1.097e7 m^-1. The Balmer-alpha line is for the transition from n=3 to n=2, so the formula is 1/λ = R (1/(2^2) - 1/(3^2)).

1/(2^2) is 1/4 = 0.25, 1/(3^2) is 1/9≈0.1111. So 0.25 - 0.1111 ≈ 0.1389.

So 1/λ = R * 0.1389. R is 1.097e7 m^-1.

So 1/λ = (1.097e7) * 0.1389 ≈ 1.097e7 * 0.1389 ≈ 1.527e6 m^-1.

So λ ≈ 1/(1.527e6) ≈ 6.55e-7 m = 655 nm. Wait, but the given λ is 486 nm, which is H-alpha. Oh wait, no, wait maybe I mixed up the transitions. Let me think again.

Wait the Balmer series is transitions to n=2. So the formula is 1/λ = R (1/4 - 1/n^2), where n=3,4,5, etc.

For n=3: 1/λ = R (1/4 - 1/9) = R*( (9-4)/36 )= R*(5/36) = R*0.1389.

Which gives 1/λ = 1.097e7 * 0.1389 ≈ 1.527e6 m^-1 → λ≈ 6.55e-7 m = 655 nm. Wait, but our given λ is 486 nm, which is H-alpha, which is longer than 486 nm? Wait, no, 486 nm is about 486 nm, which is about 0.486 micrometers. So perhaps the transition is from n=4 to n=2?

Let me compute that. For n=4: 1/λ = R (1/4 - 1/16) = R*(4/16 - 1/16) = R*(3/16) = 1.097e7 * 3/16 ≈ 2.06e6 m^-1. So λ ≈ 4.85e-7 m = 485 nm. Oh, that's exactly the given λ. So the transition is from n=4 to n=2, which corresponds to the Balmer series line H-alpha. But wait, wait, H-alpha is actually n=3→2, which gives about 656 nm. Hmm, perhaps I've made a mistake here.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the series. Let me get the correct wavelengths. The Balmer series has lines from higher n to n=2. H-alpha is n=3→2, which is about 656 nm. The next one is H-beta, n=4→2, which is about 486 nm (which matches the given λ here). Oh, so the given wavelength is H-beta. So the energy transition is from n=4 to n=2.

So the energy is ΔE = hc/λ. Let me compute that accurately.

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s
c = 299792458 m/s
λ = 486.1 nm = 486.1e-9 m.

ΔE = (6.62607015e-34 * 299792458) / (486.1e-9)

Compute numerator: 6.62607e-34 * 3e8 ≈ 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 486.1e-9 m: 1.9878e-25 / 486.1e-9 = 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 = approximately 4.088e-19 J.

To convert to eV: 4.088e-19 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 2.553 eV.

Wait, earlier I thought that was about 1.89 eV, but perhaps my initial Rydberg calculation was wrong. Hmm, perhaps I should rely on the formula.

Alternatively, using the Rydberg formula for energy levels: the energy levels of hydrogen are E_n = -13.6 eV / n².

So transition from n=4 to n=2: ΔE = E_2 - E_4 = (-13.6 /4) - (-13.6/16) ) eV = (-3.4) + (0.85) = -2.55 eV. The magnitude is 2.55 eV.

So the transition energy is ~2.55 eV. Now, the paramagnetic term is μ_B * B * m, where m is small, say m=1.

μ_B is 9.274e-24 J/T. B is 1 T. So the paramagnetic energy is 9.274e-24 * 1 *1 = 9.274e-24 J.

Convert that to eV: 9.274e-24 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 5.79e-5 eV.

So the paramagnetic term is about 5.79e-5 eV, and the transition energy is 2.55 eV. So the ratio is 5.79e-5 / 2.55 ≈ 2.27e-5, which is about 0.00227% of the transition energy. So the paramagnetic term is way, way smaller.

Thus, the paramagnetic coupling term is much less than the transition energy ΔE. So the correct option should be C) <H> << ΔE.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To compare the paramagnetic coupling term and the transition energy of the hydrogen atom, we analyze the given parameters:

1. **Transition Energy (ΔE):**  
   The wavelength of the transition is given as \( \lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m} = 486.1 \, \text{nm} \). Using the formula for photon energy,  
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda},
   \]  
   where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), we calculate:  
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{486.1 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 4.09 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
   \]  
   Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):  
   \[
   \Delta E \approx \frac{4.09 \times 10^{-19}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV}.
   \]  
   This corresponds to the energy difference between the \( n=4 \) and \( n=2 \) levels in the hydrogen atom.

2. **Paramagnetic Coupling Term:**  
   The paramagnetic coupling term arises from the interaction of the electron's magnetic moment with the external magnetic field \( \vec{B} \). The energy is given by:  
   \[
   \langle H \rangle = \mu_B B m,
   \]  
   where \( \mu_B = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \) is the Bohr magneton, \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \), and \( m \) is the orbital magnetic quantum number. For small \( m \) (e.g., \( m = 1 \)):  
   \[
   \langle H \rangle = (9.274 \times 10^{-24})(1)(1) = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}.
   \]  
   Converting to electron volts:  
   \[
   \langle H \rangle \approx \frac{9.274 \times 10^{-24}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 5.79 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

3. **Comparison:**  
   The transition energy \( \Delta E \) is approximately \( 2.55 \, \text{eV} \), while the paramagnetic coupling term \( \langle H \rangle \) is approximately \( 5.79 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV} \). The ratio of the two is:  
   \[
   \frac{\langle H \rangle}{\Delta E} \approx \frac{5.79 \times 10^{-5}}{2.55} \approx 2.27 \times 10^{-5}.
   \]  
   This shows that the paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy.

Thus, the paramagnetic coupling term is much less than the transition energy of the hydrogen atom.  

**Answer: C**
