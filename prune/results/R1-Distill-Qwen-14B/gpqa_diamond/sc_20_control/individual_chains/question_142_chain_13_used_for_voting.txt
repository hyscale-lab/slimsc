Okay, so I have this question about the density matrix of a qubit, and I need to figure out its geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think.

Density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed (like a statistical mixture of pure states) or when it's in a pure state but we're considering it in a larger system. The given density matrix here is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, that looks familiar. Oh right! That's the density matrix for a maximally mixed state. 

Wait, what's a maximally mixed state? Oh right, for a single qubit, the maximally mixed state is like being in a completely uncertain state, equally likely to be in |0⟩ or |1⟩. So it's a classical mixture, not a quantum superposition.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubit space. I remember that qubit states can be represented on the Bloch sphere. For pure states, the density matrix is a vector on the surface of the sphere. But wait, the maximally mixed state is a mixed state, so it's not on the surface. Instead, it's at the center of the Bloch sphere, right? Because it's completely mixed.

Wait, how does that translate into coordinates? The Bloch vector representation for a density matrix. I think the density matrix can be written in terms of Pauli matrices. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector (like coordinates) and σ are the Pauli matrices. 

Let me write that out. The identity matrix is I, and σ·n is the vector of Pauli matrices multiplied by the components of a unit vector n. So for the given ρ, let's expand it.

ρ = 1/2 (|0><0| + |1><1| ). Let me compute what |0><0| and |1><1| are in terms of matrices. 

|0><0| is the matrix [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I. So ρ becomes (1/2)(I), which is I/2.

Wait, so ρ = I/2. Now, using the Bloch sphere representation, ρ = (I + r·σ)/2. So if I compare, I/2 = (I + r·σ)/2. That means I/2 = I/2 + (r·σ)/2. Subtract I/2 from both sides, I get 0 = (r·σ)/2. So r·σ must be zero. 

What's r·σ? It's the dot product of r with the Pauli matrices. So each component of r is multiplied by the corresponding Pauli matrix. For the sum to be zero, each component must be zero. So r must be the zero vector. Because if r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z = 0, the only solution is r_x = r_y = r_z =0. 

Wait, because the Pauli matrices are linearly independent. So the only vector r for which r·σ = 0 is r=(0,0,0). So the point is at the origin of the Bloch sphere. 

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So that should be the correct answer.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a single qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation, the density matrix of a qubit can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{\vec{r} \cdot \vec{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix, \( \vec{\sigma} \) is the vector of Pauli matrices, and \( \vec{r} \) is a real vector that determines the position of the state in the Bloch sphere. For the given density matrix, expanding \( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| \) and \( \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \) in matrix form shows that their sum is the identity matrix \( I \). Thus, 

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

Comparing this with the general form \( \rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{\vec{r} \cdot \vec{\sigma}}{2} \), it follows that \( \vec{r} \cdot \vec{\sigma} = 0 \). Since the Pauli matrices are linearly independent, the only solution is \( \vec{r} = (0, 0, 0) \). This corresponds to the origin of the Bloch sphere, which is the geometrical position of the maximally mixed state.

Among the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A) \( r = (1,1,0) \):** Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the origin.  
**B) \( r = (0,0,1) \):** Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state along the \( z \)-axis.  
**C) \( r = (0,0,0) \):** Correct, as this is the origin of the Bloch sphere.  
**D) \( r = (1,1,1) \):** Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the origin.

Answer: C
