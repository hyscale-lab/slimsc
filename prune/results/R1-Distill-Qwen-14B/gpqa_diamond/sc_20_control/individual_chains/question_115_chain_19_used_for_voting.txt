Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an electron and a positron colliding and producing two photons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the setup: an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, they annihilate into two photons. The photons have the same energy, and their directions are upper-right and lower-right. I need to find the angle between their directions.

Wait, so the question is about the angle between the two photons. Since the photons have the same energy, but their directions are symmetric in some way—upper-right and lower-right. So maybe the angle is based on their symmetry around the horizontal axis?

Hmm, but wait, the initial particles are moving along the same line but opposite directions. So the collision is head-on. So when they annihilate, the products (photons) must obey conservation of momentum and energy.

Right, because the initial system has some momentum, so the photons must carry away momentum that adds up to the initial total momentum.

Let me think about the initial momenta. For the electron and positron, I should calculate their relativistic momenta.

The Lorentz factor gamma is given for each. The electron has gamma_e =4, and the positron has gamma_p=2. Since they're moving towards each other, their momenta would be opposite in direction.

Wait, but the positron is the antimatter counterpart of the electron. So same mass, but opposite charge. So when calculating their momenta, same formula applies.

The momentum p is gamma * m * v. Wait, or is it gamma * m * velocity in terms of c? Oh right, in terms of units, momentum is gamma m v, but in natural units where c=1, it's just gamma m v. So since the velocity is given in terms of the direction, I can compute the magnitudes.

Wait, the Lorentz factor gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²).

Let me compute their velocities first.

For the electron (gamma_e=4):
v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(4²)) = c * sqrt(1 - 1/16) = c * sqrt(15/16) = (sqrt(15)/4)*c ≈ 0.9682 c.

Similarly, for the positron (gamma_p=2):
v_p = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(2²)) = c * sqrt(3/4) = (sqrt(3)/2)*c ≈ 0.8660 c.

But wait, their directions are opposite. The electron is moving to the right (from left), and the positron is moving to the left (from right). So their velocities are in opposite directions. So the momenta would be in opposite directions.

Momentum magnitudes:

p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e
p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p

Wait, but because they're moving towards each other, the electron's momentum is to the right, and the positron's is to the left, so their momenta are in opposite directions. So when I sum the total momentum, I need to take their directions into account.

Total initial momentum is p_e (right) minus p_p (left) if I consider right as positive.

Wait, wait, no. The positron is moving to the left, so its momentum is negative if right is positive. So the total initial momentum is p_e - p_p?

Wait, no. Because the positron's speed is v_p to the left, so its momentum is -gamma_p * m_e * v_p.

So the total momentum P_total is:

P_total = p_e - p_p' where p_p' is the positron's momentum as a positive value.

Wait, let me clarify. Let me set the positive direction to the right. So the electron is moving right, momentum +p_e. The positron is moving left, so its momentum is -p_p, where p_p is gamma_p * m_e * v_p.

So total initial momentum is p_e - p_p.

Wait, no. Because the positron's momentum is gamma_p * m_e * (–v_p), so in negative direction. So P_total = p_e + p_p (since p_p is negative), or wait:

Wait, the positron's velocity is to the left, so v_p is negative if I set right as positive. So p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p, which would be negative.

So P_total = p_e (positive) + p_p (which is negative) = p_e - p_p'.

Wait, perhaps to avoid confusion, let's compute their momenta as vectors.

Electron: moving right, so momentum p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e in +x direction.

Positron: moving left, so momentum p_p = gamma_p * m_e * (-v_p) in -x direction.

So total momentum P_initial = p_e + p_p.

So P_initial = gamma_e m_e v_e - gamma_p m_e v_p.

Now, I can compute this.

But wait, since v_e and v_p are fractions of c, but when considering units, perhaps I can just compute their gamma factors and velocities.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute in terms of gamma and beta (beta = v/c). Because for a particle, p = gamma m beta c. So in terms of beta (v/c) and m, p = gamma m beta c.

So let me compute the momentum in terms of beta and gamma.

Beta_e = v_e / c = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.9682

Gamma_e =4.

Beta_p = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660

Gamma_p=2.

So,

p_e = gamma_e * m_e * beta_e * c = 4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4) * c = m_e * sqrt(15) * c.

Wait, because 4 cancels with 4 in denominator.

Similarly, p_p = gamma_p * m_e * beta_p * c = 2 * m_e * (sqrt(3)/2) * c = m_e * sqrt(3) * c.

So the electron's momentum is larger than the positron's, since sqrt(15) is about 3.87, and sqrt(3) is about 1.732.

So the total momentum is p_e (right) minus p_p (left) as vectors.

Wait, no, because the positron is moving left, so its momentum is -p_p. So P_initial = p_e - p_p.

Wait, wait, no. Because the positron's momentum is in the negative direction, so P_initial = p_e (right) + (-p_p) (since p_p is the magnitude for the positron's leftward motion).

So P_initial = p_e - p_p.

Wait, p_p is the magnitude of the positron's momentum, so yes. So P_initial = p_e - p_p.

Substituting the values:

p_e = m_e c sqrt(15)

p_p = m_e c sqrt(3)

So P_initial = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Hmm, so the initial momentum is in the right direction, since sqrt(15) is bigger than sqrt(3).

Now, when the electron and positron annihilate, they produce two photons. And the two photons have the same energy, and their directions are upper-right and lower-right.

Wait, but the problem says one is upper-right and the other is lower-right. So their directions are symmetric about the x-axis, maybe?

If the photons have the same energy, then their momenta must have the same magnitude, because for photons, energy is related to momentum by E = pc. So if E1 = E2, then p1 = p2 in magnitude.

So each photon has the same p magnitude. Now, the total momentum of the two photons must equal the initial momentum P_initial.

So the sum of the two photons' momenta vectors should equal P_initial.

Since both photons are moving in the right direction (upper-right and lower-right), their x-components add to give P_initial, and the y-components might cancel each other.

Wait, but the problem says that one photon is moving upper-right and another lower-right. So their y-components have opposite signs, but same magnitude.

Let me denote the angles of the photons as theta above and below the x-axis. So photon 1 makes angle theta above x-axis, photon 2 makes angle theta below x-axis, so their directions are symmetric.

Wait, but the problem says one is upper-right and the other is lower-right. So their angles are symmetric relative to the x-axis. So yes, their angles are theta and -theta, for example.

So each photon's momentum vector will have components:

p1_x = p * cos(theta)

p1_y = p * sin(theta)

p2_x = p * cos(theta)

p2_y = -p * sin(theta)

So the total momentum of the two photons is:

p_total_x = p1_x + p2_x = 2 p cos(theta)

p_total_y = p1_y + p2_y = 0

So the total momentum is along the x-axis, as expected because of symmetry.

But wait, the initial momentum was along the x-axis. So that makes sense.

So the sum of the two photons' x-components must equal the initial total momentum, which is P_initial.

So 2 p cos(theta) = P_initial.

But wait, each photon has energy E. Since E = pc, and E1 = E2 = E, p = E / c for each photon.

So substituting, 2 (E/c) cos(theta) = P_initial.

But E is the energy of each photon, and total energy must be conserved as well.

Wait, let's think about energy conservation.

The initial total energy is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron.

The energy of each particle is gamma m c^2.

So E_initial = gamma_e m c^2 + gamma_p m c^2.

Which is (gamma_e + gamma_p) m c^2.

So E_initial = (4 + 2) m c^2 = 6 m c^2.

After annihilation, the photons carry away energy E1 + E2 = 2 E.

So 2 E = 6 m c^2 → E = 3 m c^2.

Wait, but earlier, I thought each photon has E = p c, so 2 E = 2 p c = 6 m c^2 → p = 3 m c.

Wait, let me see. Each photon's energy is E, so 2 E = 6 m c^2 → E = 3 m c^2.

Yes, so each photon's energy is 3 m c^2, which makes their momentum p = E/c = 3 m c.

So each photon has momentum magnitude p = 3 m c.

Wait, but earlier, I had an expression: 2 p cos(theta) = P_initial.

P_initial was m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Wait, substituting p =3 m_e c (since m is m_e?), but wait, let me double-check.

Wait, m is the mass of the electron, so yes. So substituting:

2 * (3 m c) * cos(theta) = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Simplify:

6 m c cos(theta) = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Divide both sides by m c:

6 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).

So cos(theta) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6.

Hmm, let me compute that.

Compute numerator: sqrt(15) ≈3.87298, sqrt(3)≈1.73205. So 3.87298 - 1.73205 = about 2.14093.

Divide by 6: 2.14093 /6 ≈ 0.35682.

So cos(theta) ≈ 0.35682. So theta ≈ arccos(0.35682).

What's arccos(0.35682)? Let me think: cos(60) is 0.5, cos(70) is about 0.342, cos(72) is about 0.309. So 0.356 is between 70 and 72 degrees.

Wait, 70 degrees: 0.3420, 71 degrees: cos(71)=0.32557, wait no, wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, wait, I think I have this reversed. Wait, cos decreases as angle increases in 0-180. So higher angle means lower cosine. So 60 degrees is 0.5, 70 is about 0.342, 75 is about 0.2588.

Wait, 0.356 is between 70 and 65 degrees.

Wait, let's get precise.

Using a calculator in mind: let me compute.

If I have cos(theta)=0.35682.

Hmm, let me think: cos(69) is cos(60+9)= approx. Using a calculator:

But perhaps I can calculate it more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I can compute using a calculator function.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the angle using inverse cosine.

But maybe it's better to compute the angle in radians to get an exact value, but perhaps I can proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it numerically.

Wait, perhaps to get the angle, I can compute it step by step.

So, cos(theta) ≈ 0.3568.

So theta ≈ 69 degrees? Let's check.

Wait, cos(69 degrees) is approximately 0.3584.

Wait, 0.3584 is a bit higher than 0.3568. So perhaps around 69 degrees.

Wait, 69 degrees: 0.3584.

So 0.3568 is slightly less than that. So the angle is a bit more than 69 degrees, perhaps 69.1 or so.

Wait, but wait, let me think. Our calculation for cos(theta) is about 0.3568.

So when I compute the angle, it's approximately 69 degrees.

But wait, the problem gives the options as A)74, B)172, C)138, D)96. Hmm, none of these match 69 degrees. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the calculation.

Let me retrace.

Total initial momentum: P_initial = p_e (electron) - p_p (positron's momentum because it's moving left).

Wait, but earlier I might have made a mistake in the signs.

Wait, the positron is moving left, so its momentum is negative in the x-direction.

So P_initial = p_e (right, positive) + p_p (left, which is negative) → so P_initial = p_e - p_p.

Yes, that's what I had before.

Wait, but p_e = gamma_e m_e beta_e c.

Wait, beta_e is v_e/c, which is sqrt(15)/4 ≈0.9682.

p_e = gamma_e m_e beta_e c = 4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4) * c = m_e sqrt(15) c.

Similarly, p_p = gamma_p m_e beta_p c = 2 m_e (sqrt(3)/2) c = m_e sqrt(3) c.

So P_initial = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c.

Then, the photons' total x-momentum is 2 p cos(theta) = 2 * (3 m_e c) cos(theta) =6 m_e c cos(theta).

Set that equal to P_initial.

So 6 m_e c cos(theta) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c.

Cancel out m_e c from both sides:

6 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).

So cos(theta) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) /6 ≈ (3.87298 - 1.73205)/6 ≈ 2.14093/6 ≈ 0.35682.

So theta is arccos(0.35682) ≈ 69 degrees.

But the options don't have 69. The closest is option A)74. Hmm, but 74 is higher. Did I miss a factor somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial momentum calculation.

Wait, wait a second. When the electron and positron collide and annihilate, their rest masses are converted into energy for the photons, but their kinetic energies (due to motion) also contribute.

Wait, but in the initial calculation, I considered the total energy as the sum of their rest energies plus their kinetic energies. Because the initial energy is the sum of their relativistic energies.

Wait, no, wait: the initial energy is the sum of each particle's energy, which is gamma m c².

Yes, so for the electron: E_e = gamma_e m c² =4 m c².

For the positron: E_p = gamma_p m c² =2 m c².

So total energy E_initial =4 m c² +2 m c²=6 m c².

After annihilation, the photons carry away 6 m c². So each photon has energy E=3 m c².

E_photon =3 m c² → p_photon = E/c =3 m c.

So each photon's momentum is 3 m c.

So that part seems correct.

Hmm, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial momentum calculation. Let me recompute the momentum.

Electron's gamma is 4, beta is sqrt(15)/4.

So p_e =gamma_e m_e beta_e c =4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4) c = m_e sqrt(15) c.

Similarly, p_p = gamma_p m_e beta_p c. Gamma_p is 2, beta_p is sqrt(3)/2.

So p_p =2 * m_e * (sqrt(3)/2) c = m_e sqrt(3) c.

So P_initial = p_e (right) + p_p (left) = m_e sqrt(15) c - m_e sqrt(3) c = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Yes, that's correct.

So 2 * p_photon * cos(theta) = P_initial.

p_photon is 3 m_e c.

So 2 *3 m_e c * cos(theta) = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Divide both sides by m_e c:

6 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).

Which brings us back to the same equation.

So cos(theta) is approx 0.3568, theta≈69 degrees.

But the options don't have 69. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the two photons are moving in the same direction. Wait, no, the initial P_initial is to the right, so the photons must have their momenta in such a way that their sum is to the right.

Wait, but the photons are moving in upper-right and lower-right, so their directions are both in the right, but with upward and downward components.

Wait, but if their x-components add to P_initial, which is to the right, and their y-components cancel each other. So their x-components are in the same direction (right), so 2 p cos(theta) = P_initial.

So perhaps I'm correct.

But why the answer options don't include 69 degrees. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A)74

B)172

C)138

D)96

None near 69. Hmm. So maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I have a miscalculation in the initial step.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the total initial momentum is zero. No, that can't be, because the electron has higher momentum.

Wait, maybe the positron is moving to the right, not left. Wait, the question says the positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right. So if the electron is moving from left to right, and the positron is moving from right to left, their velocities are opposite.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of the positron's momentum.

Wait, the positron is moving from right (so to the left), so its velocity is to the left. So its momentum is negative in the x direction.

So the electron's momentum is positive, the positron's is negative, so the total momentum is p_e - p_p.

Yes, that's what I did earlier.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the two photons have different energies? No, the question states that both photons have the same energy.

Wait, perhaps the photons are moving in opposite directions, but both in the right. No, the problem says one is upper-right, the other lower-right.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the energy calculation.

Wait, the initial energy is 6 m c², so the photons' total energy is 6 m c².

Each photon has E=3 m c².

So each photon's momentum is E/c =3 m c.

So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the two photons are moving in the same direction? No, the problem says one is upper-right, another lower-right. So their x-components are in the same direction, but y-components opposite.

Wait, but if the photons are moving in opposite directions, that would complicate things. But the question says upper-right and lower-right, which are both in the right, but different vertical directions.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem arises from my assumption that the two photons are symmetric about the x-axis. Maybe their angles are not equal on either side, but the problem states that the directions are upper-right and lower-right. So perhaps one is in the upper right and another in the lower right, but not symmetric. Hmm, but the problem states that the measured angles are upper-right and lower-right, but doesn't specify symmetry. So maybe I shouldn't assume their angles are equal.

Wait, but if the photons have the same energy, and their directions aren't symmetric, then their momenta would have to vectorially sum to the initial momentum P_initial.

But that complicates the problem. Let me think again.

Let me denote the two photons' momenta as vectors.

Photon 1: p1 = (p_x, p_y)

Photon 2: p2 = (p'_x, p'_y)

We know that p1 + p2 = P_initial = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)), 0).

Because the initial momentum is along the x-axis.

Also, their energies are the same, E1 = E2 = E.

Since E = |p| c for photons.

So |p1| = |p2| = E/(c) =3 m_e c.

So both photons have the same magnitude of momentum, 3 m_e c.

So the problem reduces to finding two vectors of equal length (3 m_e c) that sum to a vector along the x-axis (with magnitude P_initial = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ) and their sum in y-directions is zero.

So the two vectors must be symmetric in the y-direction. So p_y for photon 1 is positive, p_y for photon 2 is negative, and their magnitudes are equal.

So the only way their y-components cancel is if they are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Hence, their angles with the x-axis must be equal in magnitude and opposite in sign.

Which brings us back to my initial assumption that the two photons are symmetric about the x-axis.

So, that would mean that the two photons have angles theta and -theta from the x-axis.

So, each photon's momentum vector would be (3 m_e c cos(theta), 3 m_e c sin(theta)) and (3 m_e c cos(theta), -3 m_e c sin(theta)).

Wait, because both are moving to the right (as upper-right and lower-right), their x-components are positive, and their y-components are positive and negative respectively.

So sum of x-components: 3 m_e c cos(theta) +3 m_e c cos(theta) =6 m_e c cos(theta) = P_initial = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

So 6 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).

Which is the same as before. So cos(theta)= (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))/6 ≈0.3568.

So theta ≈ 69 degrees.

But the options are 74, 172, 138, 96. None are 69. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of the positron. Wait, the positron is moving from the right, so it's moving to the left. So when I compute the initial momentum, perhaps the positron's momentum is to the left, so the total momentum is p_e (right) minus p_p (left), but I may have mixed up the signs.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial momentum is to the left.

Wait, no, because the electron is moving right with gamma=4, while the positron is moving left with gamma=2.

So p_e =4 m_e beta_e c, p_p =2 m_e beta_p c.

But since the positron is moving left, its contribution is negative.

So P_initial = p_e - p_p.

Wait, let's compute the numerical value.

sqrt(15) is about 3.872, sqrt(3) about 1.732.

So sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)=3.872-1.732=2.140.

So 6 cos(theta)=2.140 → cos(theta)= 2.140/6≈0.3567.

So theta=acos(0.3567)=69 degrees.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made an error in the initial momentum.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the initial momentum correctly.

Wait, maybe I should compute the velocity in terms of beta and gamma, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, velocity v = beta c.

Momentum p = gamma m v = gamma m beta c.

So, for the electron:

gamma_e=4, beta_e= sqrt(15)/4.

p_e=4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4) * c = m_e sqrt(15) c.

Similarly, positron: gamma_p=2, beta_p= sqrt(3)/2.

p_p=2 * m_e * (sqrt(3)/2) * c = m_e sqrt(3) c.

So P_initial = p_e - p_p = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the initial momentum is in the opposite direction. Because the positron is moving left, but perhaps the electron's momentum is larger, so the total is to the right.

But in any case, the calculation seems correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the two photons are moving in opposite directions. For example, one to the right and the other to the left. But the problem states that both are moving right. So their x-components are in the same direction.

Wait, but if the total initial momentum is along the x-axis, and the photons have their x-components adding up to that, but their y-components cancel, then the angles are symmetric.

So perhaps the angle between the photons is 2 theta, where theta is the angle each makes with the x-axis.

So the angle between the two photons is 2*theta.

Wait, if theta is about 69 degrees, then 2 theta is about 138 degrees.

Ah, that's one of the options. Option C is 138 degrees.

Wait, that makes sense.

Because each photon is at theta above and below the x-axis, so the angle between them is 2 theta.

So, if theta is approximately 69 degrees, the angle between them is about 138 degrees.

So, that would correspond to option C.

Therefore, the correct answer would be 138 degrees.

Wait, that makes sense. So the angle between the two photons is 2 theta, which is 2 * ~69 = 138 degrees. So option C is 138.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the collision of an electron and a positron, which annihilate into two photons of equal energy. The photons move in the upper-right and lower-right directions, and we aim to determine the angle between their directions.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial Momentum Calculation**:
   - The electron moves to the right with a Lorentz factor of 4, and the positron moves to the left with a Lorentz factor of 2.
   - The momentum of a particle is given by \( p = \gamma m \beta c \), where \( \beta = v/c \) and \( \gamma = 1/\sqrt{1-\beta^2} \).
   - For the electron:
     \[
     \beta_e = \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4}, \quad \gamma_e = 4, \quad p_e = \gamma_e m_e \beta_e c = m_e \sqrt{15} c
     \]
   - For the positron:
     \[
     \beta_p = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, \quad \gamma_p = 2, \quad p_p = \gamma_p m_e \beta_p c = m_e \sqrt{3} c
     \]
   - The total initial momentum is:
     \[
     P_{\text{initial}} = p_e - p_p = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3})
     \]

2. **Photon Momentum and Energy Conservation**:
   - The total energy of the system before annihilation is:
     \[
     E_{\text{initial}} = \gamma_e m_e c^2 + \gamma_p m_e c^2 = (4 + 2) m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2
     \]
   - After annihilation, the photons carry this energy. Since both photons have the same energy:
     \[
     E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{initial}}}{2} = 3 m_e c^2
     \]
   - For photons, \( E = pc \), so the momentum of each photon is:
     \[
     p_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{photon}}}{c} = 3 m_e c
     \]

3. **Photon Directions and Symmetry**:
   - The photons move in the upper-right and lower-right directions, symmetric about the x-axis. Denote the angle each photon makes with the x-axis as \( \theta \).
   - The momentum components of the photons are:
     \[
     p_{1x} = p_{\text{photon}} \cos\theta, \quad p_{1y} = p_{\text{photon}} \sin\theta
     \]
     \[
     p_{2x} = p_{\text{photon}} \cos\theta, \quad p_{2y} = -p_{\text{photon}} \sin\theta
     \]
   - The total momentum of the photons must equal the initial momentum:
     \[
     p_{\text{total},x} = p_{1x} + p_{2x} = 2 p_{\text{photon}} \cos\theta = P_{\text{initial}}
     \]
     \[
     p_{\text{total},y} = p_{1y} + p_{2y} = 0
     \]
   - Substituting \( P_{\text{initial}} = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}) \) and \( p_{\text{photon}} = 3 m_e c \):
     \[
     2 (3 m_e c) \cos\theta = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3})
     \]
     \[
     6 \cos\theta = \sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}
     \]
     \[
     \cos\theta = \frac{\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}}{6}
     \]

4. **Angle Calculation**:
   - Compute \( \cos\theta \):
     \[
     \cos\theta = \frac{\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}}{6} \approx \frac{3.872 - 1.732}{6} \approx 0.3568
     \]
   - Find \( \theta \) using \( \arccos(0.3568) \approx 69^\circ \).
   - The angle between the two photons is \( 2\theta \), as they are symmetric about the x-axis:
     \[
     2\theta \approx 2 \times 69^\circ = 138^\circ
     \]

### Conclusion:
The angle between the directions of the two photons is **138 degrees**.
