Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. Hmm, let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the question lists six substances, each with a benzene ring attached to some substituent. When they react with excess bromine, they form mono-bromo derivatives. The task is to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, I need to figure out for each compound how much of the para product is formed relative to the others, then order them from the least to the most para.

Wait, but electrophilic substitution... I remember that substituents on the benzene ring can be activating or deactivating, and they can also direct the incoming electrophile to certain positions—ortho, meta, or para. The directing effect determines where the substitution happens. So, activating groups (like -NH2, -OH) are ortho/para directors. Deactivating groups, like -NO2, -COOH, are meta directors.

But wait, each substituent affects the ring's reactivity. The position where the substitution occurs depends on the nature of the substituent. So, for each of the six compounds, I'll need to determine if the substituent is activating or deactivating, and whether it's an ortho/para or meta director.

Let me list the substituents:

1) CH3 (methyl)
2) COOEt (ethoxycarbonyl)
3) Cl
4) NO2
5) C2H5 (ethyl, which is same as CH2CH3)
6) COOH (carboxylic acid)

Wait, so:

1) Methyl (-CH3): Methyl is an activating group because it's an alkyl group. It's an ortho/para director.

2) COOEt: That's an ester group. Esters are deactivating because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. So, they are meta directors.

3) Cl: Chlorine is a bit tricky. It's a deactivating group because of the -I effect (electron-withdrawing), but it's an ortho/para director because of its - donating resonance effect? Wait, no. Wait, Cl is a deactivating group because the inductive effect is stronger, so overall deactivating. But as a substituent, it's ortho/para-directing. Because when the Cl is attached, the lone pairs can donate into the ring through resonance, making the ring more reactive in ortho and para positions, but the overall effect is deactivating because the inductive effect is stronger.

4) NO2: Nitro group is a strong deactivating group and meta-directing. So, substitution occurs mainly at the meta position.

5) Ethyl (-CH2CH3): Similar to methyl, it's an activating, ortho/para director. Because alkyl groups donate electrons through induction, activating the ring and directing to ortho and para.

6) COOH: Carboxylic acid group. Strongly deactivating due to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group. It's a meta director.

So now, for each substituent, the major products would depend on their directing effects.

But wait, the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, for each compound, we need to see how much of the para product is formed. Since some substituents might lead to more para products, others might lead to less, or perhaps the para is a minor product.

Wait, but for some substituents, like -NO2, the main product would be meta. So para would be a minor component. For others, like Cl, the substituent is ortho/para-directing, but maybe the para is a larger fraction.

Wait, but for each substituent, the substituent's directing effect determines where the substitution occurs. So, if the substituent is meta-directing, the major product is meta. So the para fraction would be small. If it's ortho/para-directing, the substitution could be in ortho or para, but which is more?

In para-substituted cases, since the substituent can have symmetry, sometimes the para product is a major or minor part.

Wait, but for substituents that are ortho/para directors, the para product is usually the major, assuming that the substituent is not bulky—like for a methyl group. But for some substituents, the ortho product might be more favored, especially if the substituent is bulky.

Wait, but the problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed. That probably isn't the case for all; but perhaps bromine is in excess, so all possible substitution occurs? Or perhaps each reaction leads to a mixture, but the question is about the relative yield of the para isomer.

Wait, actually, the question says, "only one monobromo derivative is formed." Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Oh, maybe that's not the case. Oh, wait, no, the question says that when they undergo the reaction, it's assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed. So each of these substituents would lead to a single product? Or perhaps I'm misreading.

Wait, perhaps the setup is that each substitution leads to one major product, but it's actually a mixture. But the question says, the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So for each compound, the product is a mix of ortho, meta, and para substitution. But for some substituents, the substituent doesn't allow for para substitution. Wait, no, that's not true. Any substituent will have para positions available unless there's some steric hindrance.

Wait, perhaps for some substituents, like nitro groups or others, the substituent is in a position that makes para substitution favorable or not. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is such that the para position is not possible. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the substituent itself is at the para position, but that's not the case here. Each substituent is on the benzene ring as a substituent, but the bromine substitution is on another carbon.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's clarify.

In each compound, the substituent is already attached to the benzene ring. The bromine is adding another substituent (monobromo). So the benzene ring will have two substituents: the original substituent and the bromine.

Wait, no. The starting material is benzene with one substituent. Then, when bromine adds, it's adding a bromine substituent. So the product will have two substituents: the original substituent and a bromine. So the question is, for each starting substituent, where does the bromine add—ortho, meta, or para to the original substituent.

So for each compound, the substituent is already present, and we're adding a bromine in a substitution reaction. The position of the bromine depends on the directing effect of the substituent.

So, for example, if the substituent is a methyl group (activating, ortho/para), then the bromine will add in ortho or para positions relative to the methyl group. So the product will be para-bromotoluene or ortho-bromotoluene, along with other possible isomers, but wait, the question says, "only one monobromo derivative is formed." Wait, that seems conflicting.

Wait, maybe that part is a bit ambiguous. Or perhaps it's assuming that each substituent has only one possible substitution site because of symmetry. For example, if the substituent is para to itself, but that's not possible. Maybe for substituents with strong directing effects, the main product is the para, but others may have more ortho.

Wait, perhaps the setup is that each reaction leads to a single mono-bromo product, but the bromine is added in a specific position. So perhaps for some substituents, the para is the major product, and for others, it's more ortho or meta.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. The problem is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So for each substituent, the bromine could add in multiple positions, but the question is about the fraction contributed by the para product.

So, the substituent's directing effect determines where the bromine adds. If the substituent is meta-directing, the bromine adds in meta positions. So the para product would be less. If the substituent is ortho/para-directing, then the bromine adds either in ortho or para positions. But which is more?

So, for each substituent, I need to determine the major product's position and thus the weight fraction of the para product.

Let's go through each substituent:

1) CH3 (methyl): It's activating, ortho/para-directing. So the bromine can add in ortho, meta, or para positions? No, wait, the methyl directs to ortho and para. So the bromine will mainly add in ortho and para positions. But what's the major product when the substituent is at the ortho or para positions?

Wait, for toluene (methylbenzene), the bromination occurs primarily at the para position, with some ortho. So the major product is para-bromotoluene, which is about 60% or so (but I'm not certain of the exact percentages), and ortho is about 30%, and the meta is minimal.

So, for substituent 1, the para fraction is the largest.

2) COOEt (ester group): This is a deactivating, meta-directing group. So the bromine would add in the meta position relative to the ester group. So the para product would not be formed (or very little), because the substituent directs to meta. So in this case, the para fraction is minimal. So the product is mainly meta, so the para fraction is low.

3) Cl: As before, Cl is ortho/para-directing but deactivating. So the bromine adds in ortho and para positions. But which is more? For chlorobenzene, the major product is para-bromochlorobenzene (about 55%) and ortho is about 40%, with some meta, but meta is minor. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Wait, chlorobenzene is deactivating but o/p-directing. So the bromine adds in o and p positions. The para product is a major component, but for a highly deactivating group, which position is more favored? Wait, I think for chlorobenzene, the major product is para-bromochlorobenzene. So the para fraction is high.

Wait, but wait, when a substituent is ortho/para-directing, the para position tends to be the major product? Or sometimes the ortho is more? For example, in toluene, para is more. But for nitro groups, the meta is more. But in chlorobenzene, the para product is major.

Wait, perhaps for Cl, the para product is the major.

4) NO2: Nitro group is meta-directing. So the bromine adds in the meta position. So the para product would be very minor. So the para fraction is low.

5) C2H5 (ethyl group): This is similar to methyl. It's an activating, ortho/para-directing group. So the bromine adds in ortho and para positions. For ethylbenzene, the major product is para-bromoethylbenzene, as the para position is more favored due to less steric hindrance compared to ortho.

So the para fraction is high.

6) COOH: The carboxylic acid group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So the bromine adds in meta positions. So the para product would be minimal. So the para fraction is low.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the exact order. Let's summarize the para fraction for each substituent:

1) CH3: high para (like 60%)
2) COOEt: low para (since meta is main)
3) Cl: high para (like 55%)
4) NO2: low para
5) C2H5: high para
6) COOH: low para

Wait, but that's not the whole story. Because some substituents might have a higher proportion of para than others.

Wait, perhaps some substituents might have even higher para fractions. Let me think again.

Wait, for substituent 3, Cl is ortho/para-directing. So the bromine can substitute in ortho or para positions. So the para product is a major component. For substituent 5 (ethyl), same as methyl, so para is major.

Wait, but substituent 6 is COOH, which is meta-directing, so para is minor.

So, for each substituent, the para fraction is:

1) CH3: high
2) COOEt: meta is major, so para is low
3) Cl: high
4) NO2: meta is major, so para is low
5) C2H5: high
6) COOH: meta is major, so para is low

Wait, but that would mean that substituents 1,3,5 have high para fractions, and 2,4,6 have low.

But the question is about the weight fraction. So we need to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of para.

So, the ones with lower para fractions come first, then higher.

Which substituents have the lowest para fractions?

Substituent 2: COOEt (ester) is meta-directing. So para fraction is low. Similarly, substituents 4 (NO2) and 6 (COOH) are meta-directing, so their para fractions are low.

Wait, but which of these has the lowest? Let me think about the directing strength.

Wait, for substituents that are meta-directing, the para product would be minimal. So the para fraction is low, but the exact order might depend on how strong the meta-directing is.

Wait, perhaps the substituents with stronger deactivating and meta-directing effects will have even lower para fractions.

Wait, for substituent 2 (COOEt): the ester group is deactivating (due to the carbonyl), and is a meta director. So bromine adds in the meta position, so the para is minimal.

Substituent 4 (NO2): Nitro is a strong deactivating, meta-directing. So bromine is added in meta, so para is minimal.

Substituent 6 (COOH): Carboxylic acid is also a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So same as substituent 2, but perhaps even stronger.

Wait, perhaps the strength of the deactivating effect influences the reactivity, but in terms of directing, they all direct to meta. So for substituent 2 (COOEt), the para fraction is low. Similarly, substituents 4 and 6 have low para fractions.

So, among substituents 2,4,6, which has the lowest para fraction? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps when the substituent is a strong deactivating group, the ring is less reactive, so even though the bromine is added, the para product might not form much because the ring is deactivated. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's structure affects the possibility of para substitution. For substituents that are bulky, the para position is more accessible than ortho, so para is favored.

Wait, but the substituents in question are as follows:

Substituent 2: COOEt (ester group) is a bulky substituent. So, when the substituent is bulky, the ortho positions might be less favored because of steric hindrance. So, in that case, para substitution would be more favored than ortho.

Wait, but substituent 2 is directing to meta, so the major product is meta. So the para fraction is low. But wait, if the substituent is bulky, perhaps the meta position is less hindered than ortho or para?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of each substituent's effect on the para product:

Substituent 1: CH3 → o/p-directing, para is major → high para fraction.

Substituent 2: COOEt → meta-directing → para is minor → low.

Substituent 3: Cl → o/p-directing → para is major → high.

Substituent 4: NO2 → meta-directing → para is minor → low.

Substituent 5: C2H5 → o/p-directing → para is major → high.

Substituent 6: COOH → meta-directing → para is minor → low.

So, the substituents can be divided into two groups: those that give high para fractions (1,3,5) and those that give low (2,4,6).

Wait, but the question is about the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. So the order would start with the substituent with the least para fraction, then next, etc.

So substituents with low para fractions are 2,4,6. Which one is the lowest?

Wait, substituent 6 is COOH, which is a very strong deactivating group. So perhaps the para product is even less likely because the ring is so deactivated. But if the substituent is in meta, the bromine is added in meta relative to COOH.

Wait, but the COOH group is a meta director, so the bromine adds in the meta position. So, for substituent 6, the para fraction is very low.

Similarly, substituent 4 (NO2) is a strong meta director, so the para fraction is low.

Substituent 2 (COOEt) is a meta director but perhaps a weaker deactivating group than COOH and NO2. So the para fraction of substituent 2 would be higher than substituents 4 and 6.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the relative strengths. Let me think: the nitro group is a stronger deactivating group than ester or carboxylic acid. Wait, no, carboxylic acid is a stronger deactivating group (due to the -COOH being more electron-withdrawing than esters. Esters have a carbonyl group but an OEt group, which is less deactivating than COOH.

Wait, the order of deactivating strength could be: NO2 > COOH > COOEt. So, substituent 4 (NO2) is the strongest deactivator, then 6 (COOH), then 2 (COOEt).

If the deactivating effect causes the ring to be less reactive, but in our case, the substituent's directing effect is the main factor. The deactivating effect affects the reactivity, but the meta or ortho/para directing is determined by the substituent's nature.

So for substituent 2, the meta product is formed, so the para fraction is low. Similarly for substituents 4 and 6.

So, perhaps among the meta-directing groups, substituent 6 (COOH) has the least para fraction because it's a stronger deactivator, making the ring less reactive and perhaps less likely to form any product, but that's not directly affecting the para fraction.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's consider each substituent's directing effect:

The meta-directing groups (2,4,6) each have a low para fraction.

The substituents that are ortho/para-directing (1,3,5) have higher para fractions.

Now, I need to arrange them in increasing order of para fraction, meaning starting from the substituent with the lowest para fraction to the highest.

So, the substituents with low para fractions are 2,4,6. Let's order them.

If substituent 6 has the lowest para fraction, followed by 4, then 2.

Wait, why? Because substituent 6 is the strongest deactivator, so the ring is less reactive, but that doesn't directly affect the para fraction. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the para product is more likely when the substituent is a better director. So, substituent 2 is a weaker meta director than 4 and 6. So, substituent 2 might have a slightly higher para fraction than 4 and 6.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps substituent 4 (NO2) has the lowest para fraction, followed by 6, then 2.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let's think about the actual products.

For substituent 2 (COOEt): the product would be meta-bromo, so para is low.

For substituent 4 (NO2): product is meta-bromo, so para is low.

For substituent 6 (COOH): same as above.

Wait, perhaps substituent 6 has the lowest para fraction, followed by 4, then 2.

But why? Because COOH is a stronger deactivator, but I'm not sure how that affects the para fraction.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent's ability to direct affects the position, but the actual yield depends on the reaction's favorability. For example, perhaps the reaction is more likely to occur in certain positions, regardless of the substituent's directing.

Wait, maybe I'm getting stuck. Let me think of the substituents in terms of their directing and activation:

- For meta-directing substituents, the para product is minimal.

So the order in terms of increasing para fraction would be:

The substituents that are meta-directing (2,4,6) have lower para fractions, so they come first. The ortho/para-directing substituents (1,3,5) have higher para fractions.

But the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer, so the order is based on how much of the para product is formed.

So the substituents with the smallest para fractions come first. Among substituents 2,4,6, which has the smallest?

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 2 (COOEt) is a meta-directing, but less deactivating than 4 and 6. So the ring is more reactive, leading to more substitution, but the para fraction is still low.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2's para fraction is higher than substituents 4 and 6, but lower than the ortho/para groups.

Wait, maybe substituent 4 (NO2) has the lowest para fraction, then 6 (COOH), then 2 (COOEt), then the ortho/para groups.

So the order would be: 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3?

Wait, but substituent 1 and 5 are similar.

Wait, substituent 3 is Cl, which is ortho/para-directing. So the para fraction is high. Similarly for substituent 1 (CH3) and 5 (C2H5).

Wait, but which substituent among 1,3,5 has the highest para fraction?

Methyl and ethyl are both activating, ortho/para-directing. I think they both have high para fractions. For chlorobenzene, the para fraction is high as well.

Wait, but perhaps the substituent's steric effects influence the para fraction. For example, a larger substituent may lead to more para substitution due to less steric hindrance.

So substituent 3 (Cl) is smaller than substituent 5 (C2H5), which is ethyl. So substituent 5 is bulkier. So the para position is more accessible, leading to a higher para fraction than substituent 3?

Wait, no, because substituent 3 is Cl and is a smaller group. So when the substituent is small, the ortho positions are more accessible, so the para product might be higher. Wait, I'm getting more confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the para product is always the major one for o/p-directing substituents, regardless of their size.

So substituents 1,3,5 have high para fractions, and 2,4,6 have low.

So arranging the six substituents in order of increasing para fraction:

The substituents with the lowest para fractions are 2,4,6, followed by 1,3,5.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 4<2<6<3<1<5

Option B: 6<2<4<5<1<3

Option C:4<6<2<1<5<3

Option D:3<5<1<6<2<4

Wait, the question is to arrange in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. So the first substituent has the least para, the next has more, etc.

I think substituent 4 is the lowest, then 6, then 2, then 3, then 1, then 5.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Let's try to think of each substituent's para fraction.

Substituent 4: NO2 → meta-directing → para fraction is very low.

Substituent 6: COOH → meta-directing → para fraction is low.

Substituent 2: COOEt → meta-directing → para fraction is low, but higher than 4 and 6.

Substituent 3: Cl → o/p-directing → para fraction is high.

Substituent 1: CH3 → o/p-directing → para fraction is high.

Substituent 5: C2H5 → o/p-directing → para fraction is high.

But wait, which of 3,1,5 has the highest para fraction? Probably substituent 5 (ethyl) because it's bulkier and para is more accessible.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me try to think of each substituent's major product.

Substituent 4 (NO2): meta is major, so para is minor → lowest para.

Substituent 6 (COOH): meta is major → para is minor, but perhaps more than substituent 4.

Substituent 2 (COOEt): meta is major → para is minor, but more than 4 and 6.

Substituent 3 (Cl): o/p-directing → para is major.

Substituent 1 (CH3): o/p-directing → para is major.

Substituent 5 (C2H5): o/p-directing → para is major.

Wait, but substituent 5 is ethyl, which is larger than methyl. So when the substituent is larger, the ortho positions are more hindered, making para more favored. So substituent 5's para fraction is higher than substituent 1.

So the order for the substituents with high para fractions would be 5 > 1 >3.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps substituent 3 (Cl) has a higher para fraction than substituent 1 and 5.

Hmm, perhaps not. Let me think.

For methylbenzene (substituent 1), bromination gives para as major.

For ethylbenzene (substituent 5), the bromine tends to add para because of less steric hindrance in the ortho positions. So substituent 5 may have a higher para fraction than 1.

Cl is a substituent on the benzene, but when Cl is present, the para substitution is major.

So, substituent 3's para fraction is high.

Wait, maybe substituent 3 is higher than substituent 1 and 5.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 3's para fraction is the highest, followed by 5, then 1.

So, putting it all together, the order of increasing para fraction would be:

4 (NO2) → 6 (COOH) → 2 (COOEt) → 1 (CH3) → 3 (Cl) →5 (C2H5)

Wait, no, because substituent 5 would have a higher para fraction than 1 and 3.

Wait, maybe substituent 5 has the highest para fraction.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 3's para fraction is the highest.

This is getting complicated. Let me think of the options again.

Looking at the options, option C is: 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3.

Option C would suggest that substituent 4 has the least para, then 6, then 2, then 1, then 5, then 3.

But from earlier analysis, substituent 3 (Cl) has a high para fraction, so it's on the higher end. So in the order of increasing, substituent 3 would be last.

Wait, but in option C, substituent 3 is last, which would have the highest para fraction. That would fit if substituent 3 has the highest.

So if the order is 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3,

That would mean:

4: least para,

6: next,

2: next,

1: next,

5: next,

3: highest.

But I'm not sure if substituent 5 has a higher para fraction than substituent 1.

Wait, substituent 5 is ethyl, which is bulkier. So the para position is more accessible, so the para fraction is higher than substituent 1 (methyl). So substituent 5 has a higher para fraction than 1.

So in the order, substituent 5 comes after 1, but before 3.

Wait, but substituent 3 (Cl) is also o/p-directing, leading to a high para fraction. Perhaps substituent 3's para fraction is higher than 5's. So substituent 3 would be last.

So the order would be 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3.

Which is option C.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

If substituent 5 (C2H5) has a higher para fraction than 1 (CH3), then in the order, substituent 5 comes after 1.

So the order would be:

4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3.

Which is option C.

I think that's the intended answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer for the given substances undergoing electrophilic bromination, we analyze the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring. Substituents can be either ortho/para-directing (activating groups) or meta-directing (deactivating groups), which influence the position of bromine substitution. The weight fraction of the para-isomer depends on the proportion of para products relative to other products.

### Analysis of Substituents:
1. **C6H5-CH3 (Methyl)**:  
   - Methyl is an activating, ortho/para-directing group.  
   - Bromination occurs predominantly at the para position, with some ortho substitution.  
   - **High para fraction**.

2. **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethoxycarbonyl)**:  
   - The ester group (-COOEt) is a deactivating, meta-directing group.  
   - Bromination occurs predominantly at the meta position.  
   - **Low para fraction**.

3. **C6H5-Cl (Chlorine)**:  
   - Chlorine is a deactivating, ortho/para-directing group due to its resonance donation.  
   - Bromination occurs predominantly at the para position, with some ortho substitution.  
   - **High para fraction**.

4. **C6H5-NO2 (Nitro)**:  
   - The nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group.  
   - Bromination occurs predominantly at the meta position.  
   - **Very low para fraction**.

5. **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethyl)**:  
   - Ethyl is an activating, ortho/para-directing group.  
   - Bromination occurs predominantly at the para position, with some ortho substitution.  
   - **High para fraction**.

6. **C6H5-COOH (Carboxylic Acid)**:  
   - The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group.  
   - Bromination occurs predominantly at the meta position.  
   - **Very low para fraction**.

### Order of Increasing Para Fraction:
- Substituents with **meta-directing groups** (2, 4, 6) have low para fractions, while those with **ortho/para-directing groups** (1, 3, 5) have high para fractions.  
- Among the meta-directing groups, the strength of the deactivating effect influences the para fraction. The nitro group (-NO2) in substituent 4 is the strongest deactivator, followed by the carboxylic acid (-COOH) in substituent 6, and then the ester (-COOEt) in substituent 2.  
- Among the ortho/para-directing groups, substituents 1 (methyl), 3 (chlorine), and 5 (ethyl) all have high para fractions. However, substituent 5 (ethyl) is bulkier, making the para position more accessible, resulting in a slightly higher para fraction than substituents 1 and 3.

Thus, the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:  
**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.

Answer: C
