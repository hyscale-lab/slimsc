Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question involves a series of reactions leading to a final product, and then determining the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in that product. The options are A to D, with numbers 4 to 10, so I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, let me try to visualize each step and the structures involved.

The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Hmm, bicyclo[2.2.1]heptadiene is a norbornene structure, right? So it's a bicyclic compound with two rings. The substituent is a tert-butoxy group attached at position 7. Norbornene is a fused bicyclic structure with two double bonds? Wait, no, the formula is hepta-2,5-diene, so double bonds at 2 and 5 positions. So the structure is norbornene with substituents.

Next, it's combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Sodium iodide is a good nucleophile, and when you have dibromomethyl groups, they're good leaving groups. So this seems like an elimination or substitution reaction. Wait, but with two equivalents, perhaps it's a di-elimination or di-addition?

Wait, the other reactant is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So cyclohexa-1,3-diene has double bonds at 1,3 positions. The 5 and 6 positions have dibromomethyl groups. So each CH2Br2 is attached to C5 and C6.

When treated with sodium iodide (NaI), which is a source of I- ions, perhaps a substitution occurs. Or maybe elimination.

Wait, the starting material is a bicyclo compound with a tert-butoxy group. The other reagent is a di-dibromomethyl cyclohexadiene. So maybe the tert-butoxy group is a good leaving group? No, wait, tert-butoxy is O-t-Bu; that's a very poor leaving group. Unless something activates it.

Wait, but I think the reaction is probably a Diels-Alder. Because norbornene derivatives are often used as dienophiles in Diels-Alder reactions. Alternatively, maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, the starting material is bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. That's a norbornene structure with two double bonds. Hmm, but norbornene has one double bond. Wait, hepta-2,5-diene would have two double bonds? Or maybe it's a conjugated diene?

Wait, no, bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene is norbornene with a single double bond. So perhaps this molecule has two double bonds? Let me draw it.

Bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene: that's two double bonds, one at 2 and another at 5 positions. So the structure is a bicyclic system with two double bonds. That makes the molecule more reactive, perhaps, in some reactions.

Now, when this reacts with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening reaction. The starting bicyclo compound has an oxygen group attached. When treated with something like NaI, perhaps it's a SN2 reaction, but O-t-Bu is a poor leaving group. Alternatively, maybe the dibromomethyl groups undergo elimination.

Wait, the other molecule is cyclohexa-1,3-diene with two dibromomethyl groups on C5 and C6. So perhaps each of those CH2Br2 groups can lose HBr and form a double bond.

Wait, but with NaI, maybe the I- will substitute for Br in a dibromomethyl group. But dibromomethyl is CH2Br2, which is a good leaving group, but substitution would require a nucleophile. So I- could attack, but it's more likely for elimination to occur, especially with heat.

Alternatively, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The starting material is the bicyclo compound with O-t-Bu. The other reagent is a di-dibromomethyl cyclohexadiene.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Diels-Alder. The cyclohexa-1,3-diene is a diene, and the bicyclo compound with two double bonds could act as a dienophile. Or maybe the other way around.

Alternatively, maybe each of the dibromomethyl groups undergoes elimination to form double bonds, converting the cyclohexa-1,3-diene into a more substituted diene.

Wait, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. When you have two vicinal dibromides (like CH2Br2), heating with a base could lead to elimination, forming a double bond. So each of the two CH2Br2 groups can lose HBr to form a double bond. So for each, CH2Br2 → CH2Br and then eliminate another HBr to form a double bond.

Wait, but with two equivalents of this reagent, perhaps each of the two CH2Br2 groups in the cyclohexadiene would lose two HBr each, forming two double bonds. But wait, the starting cyclohexadiene already has double bonds at 1 and 3. So if the 5 and 6 positions have CH2Br2, eliminating HBr from each would form double bonds between 5-6, but wait, that might not be possible because of the structure.

Wait, perhaps the initial cyclohexa-1,3-diene structure is such that the 5 and 6 positions are adjacent. So when Br is eliminated from each position, perhaps a new double bond is formed between C5 and C6. But that would create a conjugated diene from 1,3 to 5,6, but that might not be possible. Alternatively, perhaps each CH2Br2 group loses HBr to form a double bond, increasing the number of double bonds in the ring. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the dibromomethyl groups undergo substitution. The NaI provides I- which could substitute Br in the CH2Br2 groups. But CH2Br2 is a good leaving group? No, because it's a primary bromide, but with two leaving groups, maybe it's a better leaving group.

Wait, substitution would require the CH2Br2 to have a leaving group, but it's not a great scenario. Alternatively, perhaps the iodide ion abstracts a proton, leading to elimination.

Wait, let's think about the overall reaction. The starting bicyclo compound reacts with 2 equivalents of the di-dibromomethyl cyclohexadiene and NaI. Perhaps the O-t-Bu group is a leaving group, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, the reaction could be a ring-opening of the bicyclo compound via nucleophilic attack.

Wait, maybe the bicyclo compound is opening up. The O-t-Bu group is at position 7. If the bicyclo ring opens, perhaps the oxygen becomes a leaving group. But O-t-Bu is a poor leaving group, though under certain conditions, maybe it can leave. For example, under acidic conditions, but here NaI is present, which is a source of iodide ions, which are good nucleophiles.

Alternatively, perhaps the other molecule is undergoing substitution. The cyclohexadiene has two CH2Br2 groups. Each CH2Br2 can react with iodide in an SN2 reaction, replacing Br with I. But I'm not sure if that's the case here, because the question doesn't mention any halogen exchange in the product.

Wait, the product is called product 1. Then product 1 is treated with aqueous H2SO4 to form product 2. Then product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO to form product 3. Finally, product 3 is heated at 150C to form product 4.

So I need to figure out what each of these steps does.

Let me think about the first reaction again. The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. When it's reacted with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and NaI, perhaps each of the di-dibromomethyl groups is undergoing a substitution.

Wait, but 2 equivalents of the di-dibromomethyl cyclohexadiene would mean that both CH2Br2 groups react. So perhaps each of the CH2Br2 groups in the cyclohexadiene is substituted by iodide, giving CH2I2 groups. But then, what's the purpose of that?

Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution where the O-t-Bu group acts as a leaving group, but I'm not certain about that. Alternatively, maybe the NaI is a catalyst for some elimination.

Wait, another thought: the bicyclo compound with two double bonds can undergo a Diels-Alder reaction. The cyclohexadiene is a diene, and the bicyclo compound is a dienophile. So perhaps each of the two diene molecules reacts with the dienophile.

Wait, but the starting bicyclo compound is a dienophile. So each cyclohexadiene molecule would react with the bicyclo compound in a Diels-Alder reaction, but since we're using 2 equivalents, maybe two Diels-Alder adducts form?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition leading to a bridged bicyclic structure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening of the bicyclo compound via the diene. Let me think: bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene has two double bonds. When reacting with a diene, perhaps it's a 1,3-diene that adds to it.

Wait, perhaps the starting bicyclo compound has a dienophilic double bond, and the cyclohexadiene is the diene. So each equivalent of the cyclohexadiene would add to the bicyclo structure, leading to a larger ring.

Alternatively, maybe the 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene is undergoing substitution, replacing Br with another group. Wait, with NaI, perhaps the dibromomethyl groups are undergoing substitution to form iodomethyl groups, but I'm not sure how that would tie into the reaction with the bicyclo compound.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening of the bicyclo compound. For instance, the bicyclo structure could open up when the O-t-Bu group leaves, generating a carbocation, which could then react with the diene.

Wait, but O-t-Bu is a poor leaving group. Maybe under certain conditions, like with NaI, which is a source of iodide ions. Maybe the O-t-Bu group is replaced by iodide, but that would require a good leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps the bicyclo structure opens under these conditions, leading to a diol or something else. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, maybe I should think of the first reaction as a diels-alder reaction. The cyclohexadiene is the diene, and the bicyclo compound is the dienophile. So each cyclohexadiene molecule would react with the bicyclo.

Wait, the reaction uses two equivalents of the cyclohexadiene. So perhaps two diels-alder reactions happen, each adding a cyclohexadiene to the bicyclo structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting bicyclo compound has two dienophilic double bonds, so each can react with a diene, leading to a larger molecule.

But this seems a bit complicated. Maybe I should move on and think about what product 1 would look like, then proceed to the next steps, perhaps that will help.

So, product 1 is formed after reacting the starting material with two equivalents of the di-dibromomethyl cyclohexadiene and NaI.

Perhaps product 1 is a Diels-Alder adduct. Let's imagine that each cyclohexadiene adds to the bicyclo compound via Diels-Alder, leading to a new six-membered ring. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a bridged structure.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a dienophile, and each cyclohexadiene is the diene, so each adds across the double bonds of the bicyclo structure. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material isn't the dienophile but the diene. Hmm.

Wait, the starting bicyclo compound has two double bonds. If each can act as a dienophile, then two Diels-Alder reactions could occur, adding two dienes to it. But each diene is from the cyclohexadiene.

But the cyclohexadiene is a conjugated diene, so perhaps each can add to the bicyclo structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening of the bicyclo compound. When the O-t-Bu group leaves (maybe under acidic conditions, but NaI isn't acidic), forming a carbocation, and then the diene attacks.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about the possible products and what comes next.

After product 1 is formed, it's treated with aqueous H2SO4 to form product 2. Then product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO to form product 3. Finally, product 3 is heated, possibly causing some elimination or rearrangement, leading to product 4.

Looking at the reagents:

- Aqueous H2SO4: could be acid-catalyzed reaction, such as hydrolysis, hydration, or ring-opening.

- SO3 and pyridine in DMSO: this setup is reminiscent of the sulfonation or sulfonamide formation. Wait, SO3 is typically used in sulfonation reactions, where a sulfonic acid group is added. Pyridine is a base, and DMSO is a polar aprotic solvent. So perhaps product 2 is being sulfonated at certain positions.

- Heating product 3 at 150°C: this could lead to elimination reactions, such as the loss of a leaving group to form a double bond or ring structure.

But perhaps I should focus on each step.

First step: product 1 is formed from the starting materials. The second step, with aqueous H2SO4, could involve acid-catalyzed ring-opening or other protonation and elimination.

Wait, another thought: the starting material is a bicyclo with an O-t-Bu substituent. When treated with aqueous acid, the O-t-Bu group could get protonated, making it a better leaving group, leading to ring-opening. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a Diels-Alder adduct, and upon treatment with acid, it undergoes retro-Diels-Alder or some rearrangement.

Alternatively, the starting material's O-t-Bu group may not be directly involved in the first reaction, and product 1 is simply the addition of two equivalents of the di-dibromomethylcyclohexadiene to the starting material via a different mechanism.

Wait, perhaps each of the two CH2Br2 groups in the cyclohexadiene acts as a dienophile. But no, the cyclohexadiene is a diene, not a dienophile.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. The NaI provides I- which could attack at certain positions, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the bicyclo compound is reacting with the cyclohexadiene via some kind of [2+4] cycloaddition, but I'm not very familiar with such reactions.

Hmm, maybe I'm stuck on the first step. Let me try to think about the products and work backward.

The final product, product 4, is formed by heating product 3. Heating product 3 at 150°C probably leads to some elimination. The reagent for product 3 is SO3 and pyridine in DMSO. So product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO to form product 3.

Wait, I remember that treating a compound with SO3 in the presence of a base like pyridine can lead to sulfonation, where a sulfonic acid group is added. Alternatively, if the compound has a leaving group, like a tosylate, perhaps it's a good leaving group.

Wait, but product 2 is the result of treating product 1 with aqueous H2SO4. H2SO4 is a strong acid and a dehydrating agent. So perhaps product 1 undergoes acid-catalyzed dehydration or rearrangement.

Alternatively, product 1 could be a diol or some other structure that, under acidic conditions, would lose water or form an ester.

Wait, maybe product 1 has some diol groups, which upon treatment with H2SO4, undergo dehydration to form a double bond.

Alternatively, the starting material has a bridged bicyclic structure, and product 1 is an addition product. Then, under acid, it might ring-open.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a bridged structure with some substituents, and treatment with H2SO4 leads to some rearrangement.

Honestly, I'm not making much progress on the first step. Let me think of another approach: maybe the overall process is a synthesis leading to a molecule with certain symmetry or substituents, which will influence the number of distinct hydrogens.

The final question is about the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4. So maybe the final structure has several equivalent Hs, perhaps due to symmetry.

Looking at the options, the choices are 4,7,8,10.

Let me think of a structure that would have 7 distinct Hs. For example, a molecule with a bridged bicyclic structure, some symmetry, perhaps with substituents in symmetric positions.

Wait, the starting material is a norbornene derivative. After reactions, perhaps product 4 is a more complex polycyclic structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a cubane or another highly symmetric structure, but that's probably not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a molecule with multiple rings and substituents arranged symmetrically, leading to a certain number of distinct Hs.

Wait, let me try to outline each reaction step again:

1. Starting with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene.

2. React with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and NaI. Product 1.

3. Treat product 1 with aqueous H2SO4. Product 2.

4. Treat product 2 with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO. Product 3.

5. Heat product 3 at 150°C. Product 4.

Hmm, perhaps the first step is a Diels-Alder reaction. Let me imagine that the bicyclo compound is a dienophile. The cyclohexadiene is a diene. So each of the two equivalents would add to the bicyclo compound, forming two Diels-Alder adducts. But wait, the starting bicyclo has two double bonds, so perhaps each can react with a diene.

Wait, but Diels-Alder requires a diene and a dienophile. So perhaps each equivalent of the cyclohexadiene (diene) reacts with the bicyclo compound (dienophile) in a Diels-Alder reaction, leading to a six-membered ring adduct. Since two equivalents are used, maybe two such adducts form, leading to a more complex structure.

Alternatively, perhaps each of the two diene molecules adds to the same dienophile, leading to a fused ring structure.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let's proceed under the assumption that product 1 is a Diels-Alder adduct.

Moving on, product 1 is treated with aqueous H2SO4. Acid could protonate certain groups, leading to ring-opening or rearrangement.

Then, product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine. SO3 is used in sulfonation, so perhaps a sulfonic acid group is added. Alternatively, if product 2 has a leaving group, like a bromide, it might be replaced by a sulfonic acid group.

Finally, product 3 is heated, which could cause elimination of a leaving group, forming a double bond or ring structure.

But perhaps product 3 is a sulfonated compound, which upon heating, undergoes some elimination.

Alternatively, if product 3 is a sulfonate ester, heating might cause it to lose the sulfonate group as a leaving group, forming a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the overall process leads to the formation of a tricyclic structure with multiple substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a molecule with a norbornene system and some substituents, leading to a certain number of distinct hydrogens.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think of the possible structures after each step.

First step: 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene reacts with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and NaI.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the O-t-Bu group is replaced by something else. But O-t-Bu isn't a good leaving group, so that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the dibromomethyl groups undergo elimination, forming new double bonds. Each CH2Br2 could lose two equivalents of HBr to form a double bond. So each would become CH2, with a double bond between C5 and C6.

Wait, the starting cyclohexadiene has double bonds at 1 and 3. If the 5 and 6 positions (adjacent to each other) have CH2Br2 groups, eliminating HBr from each would form a new double bond between C5 and C6. So each dibromomethyl group becomes a double bond, making the cyclohexadiene into a triene or something else. But that's just for each of the two equivalents.

Wait, but the starting material is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl), so after elimination, each of these positions becomes a double bond, so the cyclohexa-1,3-diene becomes a cyclohexa-1,3,5,6-tetraene? That's not possible because of conjugation.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, converting each CH2Br2 into a double bond. So the cyclohexa-1,3-diene becomes a cyclohexa-1,3,5,6-tetraene, which is an allene structure. But that might not be stable, so perhaps each CH2Br2 group loses one HBr, becoming CH2Br with a double bond elsewhere.

Wait, but with two equivalents, perhaps two eliminations happen. So each of the two CH2Br2 groups in the cyclohexadiene loses HBr, forming a double bond. So the cyclohexa-1,3-diene becomes a cyclohexa-1,3,5-diene. So with double bonds at 1,3, and 5.

Alternatively, perhaps the 5 and 6 positions form a new double bond, making the cyclohexadiene into a cyclohexa-1,3,5-triene, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination occurs at each CH2Br2 group, forming a new double bond and releasing HBr. So each CH2Br2 becomes CHBr and a double bond, but that doesn't quite make sense.

Wait, maybe each CH2Br2 group undergoes dehydrohalogenation, losing HBr to form a double bond. So for each CH2Br2, you lose two HBr molecules to form a double bond. So each CH2Br2 → CBr=CH2? No, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, each CH2Br2 group could lose one HBr, becoming CHBr=CH2. But I'm not certain.

Another approach: perhaps the di-dibromomethyl cyclohexadiene is undergoing a substitution reaction with the iodide, replacing Br with I. So each CH2Br2 becomes CH2I2. But then, what's the purpose? Maybe the iodide is a better leaving group for subsequent reactions.

Wait, perhaps product 1 has iodide substituents which are then involved in elimination steps later.

But I'm not making progress. Let me think about the possible structures after each step.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a ring-opening of the bicyclo structure via a nucleophilic attack. The O-t-Bu group is attached to a bridgehead carbon. If it leaves, perhaps the ring opens, and the diene attacks.

Alternatively, perhaps the diene acts as a nucleophile, attacking the bicyclo structure.

Alternatively, considering that the starting material has two double bonds, maybe each of them reacts with the diene in a Diels-Alder fashion.

Wait, if each double bond in the bicyclo compound reacts with a diene, perhaps two Diels-Alder adducts form, leading to a more complex structure.

But I'm not sure. Maybe the initial reaction forms a bridged structure with two new six-membered rings attached.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is a coupling, where the diene and the bicyclo compound form a new bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that requires aromatic rings, which the starting material doesn't have.

Alternatively, perhaps the NaI is a catalyst for some elimination reactions, leading to the formation of more double bonds.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction forms a ring-opened structure. The O-t-Bu group could leave, forming a carbocation, which then reacts with the diene.

But again, O-t-Bu is a poor leaving group, so this might not be feasible without some activation.

Alternatively, perhaps the di-dibromomethyl groups are activated by the NaI, leading to elimination and forming new double bonds, making the cyclohexadiene into a more reactive diene.

Wait, perhaps the cyclohexa-1,3-diene is converted into a more conjugated diene via elimination of the dibromomethyl groups.

But I'm not making progress on this. Let me try to think about the next steps, maybe that will help.

Product 1 is treated with aqueous H2SO4, leading to product 2. H2SO4 is a strong acid and can protonate groups, perhaps leading to ring-opening or dehydration.

Then product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO. SO3 is used for sulfonation, so perhaps product 2 has a hydroxyl group which is then sulfonated.

Finally, product 3 is heated at 150C, perhaps leading to elimination or rearrangement.

Wait, maybe the overall process is synthesizing a sulfonated compound which upon heating eliminates to form a double bond.

But without knowing the exact structures, it's hard to proceed. Let me think about the final product's structure.

If the final product is a bridged bicyclic structure with several substituents, perhaps it has a certain number of distinct Hs.

For example, norbornene derivatives often have symmetry, leading to fewer distinct Hs.

Wait, norbornene (bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene) has a structure where some Hs are equivalent due to symmetry.

If the final product is a norbornene derivative with substituents that are symmetrically placed, perhaps the number of distinct Hs is 4, 7, 8, or 10.

Looking at the options, 7 is one of the choices. So perhaps the final product has 7 distinct Hs.

But how?

Alternatively, if the final product is a molecule with several rings and substituents arranged symmetrically, the number could be lower.

Alternatively, maybe the final product is a cubane-like structure but that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product has multiple rings and substituents leading to 7 distinct Hs.

Wait, perhaps the structure has several equivalent positions. For example, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, some Hs would be equivalent.

Alternatively, the final product could have a bridged bicyclic structure with substituents, leading to 7 distinct Hs.

But without the exact structure, it's hard to be precise.

Alternatively, perhaps the final step is a dehydrohalogenation, leading to a double bond which reduces the number of Hs but increases symmetry.

Wait, perhaps the final product has a ring with several substituents leading to multiple equivalent Hs.

Let me try to think of a specific structure.

Suppose the final product is a tricyclic compound with a norbornene core and some substituents. Let's say it has three rings, and the substituents are in positions that make some Hs equivalent.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a molecule with a bridged bicyclic structure and several substituents, leading to 7 distinct Hs.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a bicyclo structure with several substituents, each in symmetric positions, leading to 7 Hs.

But I'm not entirely sure, so I'll have to make an educated guess based on the steps.

The options are A)8, B)4, C)10, D)7.

I think the correct answer is D)7.

Answer: D

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question involves a series of reactions leading to a final product, and then determining the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in that product. The options are A to D, with numbers 4 to 10, so I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, let me try to visualize each step and the structures involved.

The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Hmm, bicyclo[2.2.1]heptadiene is a norbornene structure, right? So it's a bicyclic compound with two rings. The substituent is a tert-butoxy group attached at position 7. Norbornene is a fused bicyclic structure with two double bonds? Wait, no, the formula is hepta-2,5-diene, so double bonds at 2 and 5 positions. So the structure is norbornene with substituents.

Next, it's combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Sodium iodide is a good nucleophile, and when you have dibromomethyl groups, they're good leaving groups. So this seems like an elimination or substitution reaction. Wait, but with two equivalents, perhaps it's a di-elimination or di-addition?

Wait, the other reactant is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So cyclohexa-1,3-diene has double bonds at 1,3 positions. The 5 and 6 positions have dibromomethyl groups. So each CH2Br2 is attached to C5 and C6.

When treated with sodium iodide (NaI), which is a source of I- ions, perhaps a substitution occurs. Or maybe elimination.

Wait, the starting material is a bicyclo compound with a tert-butoxy group. The other reagent is a di-dibromomethyl cyclohexadiene. So maybe the tert-butoxy group is a good leaving group? No, wait, tert-butoxy is O-t-Bu; that's a very poor leaving group. Unless something activates it.

Wait, but I think the reaction is probably a Diels-Alder. Because norbornene derivatives are often used as dienophiles in Diels-Alder reactions. Alternatively, maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, the starting material is bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. That's a norbornene structure with two double bonds. Hmm, but norbornene has one double bond. Wait, hepta-2,5-diene would have two double bonds? Or maybe it's a conjugated diene?

Wait, no, bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene is norbornene with a single double bond. So perhaps this molecule has two double bonds? Let me draw it.

Bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene: that's two double bonds, one at 2 and another at 5 positions. So the structure is a bicyclic system with two double bonds. That makes the molecule more reactive, perhaps, in some reactions.

Now, when this reacts with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening reaction. The starting bicyclo compound has an oxygen group attached. When treated with something like NaI, perhaps it's a SN2 reaction, but O-t-Bu is a poor leaving group. Alternatively, maybe the dibromomethyl groups undergo elimination.

Wait, the other molecule is cyclohexa-1,3-diene with two dibromomethyl groups on C5 and C6. So perhaps each of those CH2Br2 groups can lose HBr and form a double bond.

Wait, but with NaI, maybe the I- will substitute for Br in a dibromomethyl group. But dibromomethyl is CH2Br2, which is a good leaving group, but substitution would require a nucleophile. So I- could attack, but it's more likely for elimination to occur, especially with heat.

Alternatively, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The starting material is the bicyclo compound with O-t-Bu. The other reagent is a di-dibromomethyl cyclohexadiene.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Diels-Alder. The cyclohexa-1,3-diene is a diene, and the bicyclo compound with two double bonds could act as a dienophile. Or maybe the other way around.

Alternatively, maybe each of the dibromomethyl groups undergoes elimination to form double bonds, converting the cyclohexa-1,3-diene into a more substituted diene.

Wait, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. When you have two vicinal dibromides (like CH2Br2), heating with a base could lead to elimination, forming a double bond. So each of the two CH2Br2 groups can lose HBr to form a double bond. So for each, CH2Br2 → CH2Br and then eliminate another HBr to form a double bond.

Wait, but with two equivalents of this reagent, perhaps each of the two CH2Br2 groups in the cyclohexadiene would lose two HBr each, forming two double bonds. But wait, the starting cyclohexadiene already has double bonds at 1 and 3. So if the 5 and 6 positions have CH2Br2, eliminating HBr from each would form double bonds between 5-6, but wait, that might not be possible because of the structure.

Wait, perhaps the initial cyclohexa-1,3-diene structure is such that the 5 and 6 positions are adjacent. So when Br is eliminated from each position, perhaps a new double bond is formed between C5 and C6. But that would create a conjugated diene from 1,3 to 5,6, but that might not be possible. Alternatively, perhaps each CH2Br2 group loses HBr to form a double bond, increasing the number of double bonds in the ring. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the dibromomethyl groups undergo substitution. The NaI provides I- which could substitute Br in the CH2Br2 groups. But CH2Br2 is a good leaving group? No, because it's a primary bromide, but with two leaving groups, maybe it's a better leaving group.

Wait, substitution would require the CH2Br2 to have a leaving group, but it's not a great scenario. Alternatively, perhaps the iodide ion abstracts a proton, leading to elimination.

Wait, let's think about the overall reaction. The starting bicyclo compound reacts with 2 equivalents of the di-dibromomethyl cyclohexadiene and NaI. Perhaps the O-t-Bu group is a leaving group, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, the reaction could be a ring-opening of the bicyclo compound via nucleophilic attack.

Wait, maybe the bicyclo compound is opening up. The O-t-Bu group is at position 7. If the bicyclo ring opens, perhaps the oxygen becomes a leaving group. But O-t-Bu is a poor leaving group, though under certain conditions, maybe it can leave. For example, under acidic conditions, but here NaI is present, which is a source of iodide ions, which are good nucleophiles.

Alternatively, perhaps the other molecule is undergoing substitution. The cyclohexadiene has two CH2Br2 groups. Each CH2Br2 can react with iodide in an SN2 reaction, replacing Br with I. But I'm not sure if that's the case here, because the question doesn't mention any halogen exchange in the product.

Wait, the product is called product 1. Then product 1 is treated with aqueous H2SO4 to form product 2. Then product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO to form product 3. Finally, product 3 is heated at 150C to form product 4.

So I need to figure out what each of these steps does.

Let me think about the first reaction again. The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. When it's reacted with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and NaI, perhaps each of the di-dibromomethyl groups is undergoing a substitution.

Wait, but 2 equivalents of the di-dibromomethyl cyclohexadiene would mean that both CH2Br2 groups react. So perhaps each of the CH2Br2 groups in the cyclohexadiene is substituted by iodide, giving CH2I2 groups. But then, what's the purpose of that?

Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution where the O-t-Bu group acts as a leaving group, but I'm not certain about that. Alternatively, maybe the NaI is a catalyst for some elimination.

Wait, another thought: the bicyclo compound with two double bonds can undergo a Diels-Alder reaction. The cyclohexadiene is a diene, and the bicyclo compound is a dienophile. So perhaps each of the two diene molecules reacts with the dienophile.

Wait, but the starting bicyclo compound is a dienophile. So each cyclohexadiene molecule would react with the bicyclo compound in a Diels-Alder reaction, but since we're using 2 equivalents, maybe two Diels-Alder adducts form?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition leading to a bridged bicyclic structure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening of the bicyclo compound via the diene. Let me think: bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene has two double bonds. When reacting with a diene, perhaps it's a 1,3-diene that adds to it.

Wait, perhaps the starting bicyclo compound has a dienophilic double bond, and the cyclohexadiene is the diene. So each equivalent of the cyclohexadiene would add to the bicyclo structure, leading to a larger ring.

Alternatively, maybe the 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene is undergoing substitution, replacing Br with another group. Wait, with NaI, perhaps the dibromomethyl groups are undergoing substitution to form iodomethyl groups, but I'm not sure how that would tie into the reaction with the bicyclo compound.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening of the bicyclo compound. For instance, the bicyclo structure could open up when the O-t-Bu group leaves, generating a carbocation, which could then react with the diene.

Wait, but O-t-Bu is a poor leaving group. Maybe under certain conditions, like with NaI, which is a source of iodide ions. Maybe the O-t-Bu group is replaced by iodide, but that would require a good leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps the bicyclo structure opens under these conditions, leading to a diol or something else. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, maybe I should think of the first reaction as a diels-alder reaction. The cyclohexadiene is the diene, and the bicyclo compound is the dienophile. So each cyclohexadiene molecule would react with the bicyclo.

Wait, the reaction uses two equivalents of the cyclohexadiene. So perhaps two diels-alder reactions happen, each adding a cyclohexadiene to the bicyclo structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting bicyclo compound has two dienophilic double bonds, so each can react with a diene, leading to a larger molecule.

But this seems a bit complicated. Maybe I should move on and think about what product 1 would look like, then proceed to the next steps, perhaps that will help.

So, product 1 is formed after reacting the starting material with two equivalents of the di-dibromomethyl cyclohexadiene and NaI.

Perhaps product 1 is a Diels-Alder adduct. Let's imagine that each cyclohexadiene adds to the bicyclo compound via Diels-Alder, leading to a new six-membered ring. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a bridged structure.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a dienophile, and each cyclohexadiene is the diene, so each adds across the double bonds of the bicyclo structure. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material isn't the dienophile but the diene. Hmm.

Wait, the starting bicyclo compound has two double bonds. If each can act as a dienophile, then two Diels-Alder reactions could occur, adding two dienes to it. But each diene is from the cyclohexadiene.

But the cyclohexadiene is a conjugated diene, so perhaps each can add to the bicyclo structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening of the bicyclo compound. When the O-t-Bu group leaves (maybe under acidic conditions, but NaI isn't acidic), forming a carbocation, and then the diene attacks.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about the possible products and what comes next.

After product 1 is formed, it's treated with aqueous H2SO4 to form product 2. Then product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO to form product 3. Finally, product 3 is heated, possibly causing some elimination or rearrangement, leading to product 4.

Looking at the reagents:

- Aqueous H2SO4: could be acid-catalyzed reaction, such as hydrolysis, hydration, or ring-opening.

- SO3 and pyridine in DMSO: this setup is reminiscent of the sulfonation or sulfonamide formation. Wait, SO3 is typically used in sulfonation reactions, where a sulfonic acid group is added. Pyridine is a base, and DMSO is a polar aprotic solvent. So perhaps product 2 is being sulfonated at certain positions.

- Heating product 3 at 150°C: this could lead to elimination reactions, such as the loss of a leaving group to form a double bond or ring structure.

But perhaps I should focus on each step.

First step: product 1 is formed from the starting materials. The second step, with aqueous H2SO4, could involve acid-catalyzed ring-opening or other protonation and elimination.

Wait, another thought: the starting material is a bicyclo with an O-t-Bu substituent. When treated with aqueous acid, the O-t-Bu group could get protonated, making it a better leaving group, leading to ring-opening. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a Diels-Alder adduct, and upon treatment with acid, it undergoes retro-Diels-Alder or some rearrangement.

Alternatively, the starting material's O-t-Bu group may not be directly involved in the first reaction, and product 1 is simply the addition of two equivalents of the di-dibromomethylcyclohexadiene to the starting material via a different mechanism.

Wait, perhaps each of the two CH2Br2 groups in the cyclohexadiene acts as a dienophile. But no, the cyclohexadiene is a diene, not a dienophile.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. The NaI provides I- which could attack at certain positions, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the bicyclo compound is reacting with the cyclohexadiene via some kind of [2+4] cycloaddition, but I'm not very familiar with such reactions.

Hmm, maybe I'm stuck on the first step. Let me try to think about the products and work backward.

The final product, product 4, is formed by heating product 3. Heating product 3 at 150°C probably leads to some elimination. The reagent for product 3 is SO3 and pyridine in DMSO. So product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO to form product 3.

Wait, I remember that treating a compound with SO3 in the presence of a base like pyridine can lead to sulfonation, where a sulfonic acid group is added. Alternatively, if the compound has a leaving group, like a tosylate, perhaps it's a good leaving group.

Wait, but product 2 is the result of treating product 1 with aqueous H2SO4. H2SO4 is a strong acid and a dehydrating agent. So perhaps product 1 undergoes acid-catalyzed dehydration or rearrangement.

Alternatively, product 1 could be a diol or some other structure that, under acidic conditions, would lose water or form an ester.

Wait, maybe product 1 has some diol groups, which upon treatment with H2SO4, undergo dehydration to form a double bond.

Alternatively, the starting material has a bridged bicyclic structure, and product 1 is an addition product. Then, under acid, it might ring-open.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a bridged structure with some substituents, and treatment with H2SO4 leads to some rearrangement.

Honestly, I'm not making much progress on the first step. Let me think of another approach: maybe the overall process is a synthesis leading to a molecule with certain symmetry or substituents, which will influence the number of distinct hydrogens.

The final question is about the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4. So maybe the final structure has several equivalent Hs, perhaps due to symmetry.

Looking at the options, the choices are 4,7,8,10.

Let me think of a structure that would have 7 distinct Hs. For example, a molecule with a bridged bicyclic structure, some symmetry, perhaps with substituents in symmetric positions.

Wait, the starting material is a norbornene derivative. After reactions, perhaps product 4 is a more complex polycyclic structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a cubane or another highly symmetric structure, but that's probably not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a molecule with multiple rings and substituents arranged symmetrically, leading to a certain number of distinct Hs.

Wait, let me try to outline each reaction step again:

1. Starting with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene.

2. React with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and NaI. Product 1.

3. Treat product 1 with aqueous H2SO4. Product 2.

4. Treat product 2 with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO. Product 3.

5. Heat product 3 at 150°C. Product 4.

Hmm, perhaps the first step is a Diels-Alder reaction. Let me imagine that the bicyclo compound is a dienophile. The cyclohexadiene is a diene. So each of the two equivalents would add to the bicyclo compound, forming two Diels-Alder adducts. But wait, the starting bicyclo has two double bonds, so perhaps each can react with a diene.

Wait, but Diels-Alder requires a diene and a dienophile. So perhaps each equivalent of the cyclohexadiene (diene) reacts with the bicyclo compound (dienophile) in a Diels-Alder reaction, leading to a six-membered ring adduct. Since two equivalents are used, maybe two such adducts form, leading to a more complex structure.

Alternatively, perhaps each of the two diene molecules adds to the same dienophile, leading to a fused ring structure.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let's proceed under the assumption that product 1 is a Diels-Alder adduct.

Moving on, product 1 is treated with aqueous H2SO4. Acid could protonate certain groups, leading to ring-opening or rearrangement.

Then, product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine. SO3 is used in sulfonation, so perhaps a sulfonic acid group is added. Alternatively, if product 2 has a leaving group, like a bromide, it might be replaced by a sulfonic acid group.

Finally, product 3 is heated, which could cause elimination of a leaving group, forming a double bond or ring structure.

But perhaps product 3 is a sulfonated compound, which upon heating, undergoes some elimination.

Alternatively, if product 3 is a sulfonate ester, heating might cause it to lose the sulfonate group as a leaving group, forming a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the overall process leads to the formation of a tricyclic structure with multiple substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a molecule with a norbornene system and some substituents, leading to a certain number of distinct hydrogens.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think of the possible structures after each step.

First step: 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene reacts with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and NaI.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the O-t-Bu group is replaced by something else. But O-t-Bu isn't a good leaving group, so that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the dibromomethyl groups undergo elimination, forming new double bonds. Each CH2Br2 could lose two equivalents of HBr to form a double bond. So each would become CH2, with a double bond between C5 and C6.

Wait, the starting cyclohexadiene has double bonds at 1 and 3. If the 5 and 6 positions (adjacent to each other) have CH2Br2 groups, eliminating HBr from each would form a new double bond between C5 and C6. So each dibromomethyl group becomes a double bond, making the cyclohexadiene into a triene or something else. But that's just for each of the two equivalents.

Wait, but the starting material is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl), so after elimination, each of these positions becomes a double bond, so the cyclohexa-1,3-diene becomes a cyclohexa-1,3,5,6-tetraene? That's not possible because of conjugation.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, converting each CH2Br2 into a double bond. So the cyclohexa-1,3-diene becomes a cyclohexa-1,3,5,6-tetraene, which is an allene structure. But that might not be stable, so perhaps each CH2Br2 group loses one HBr, becoming CH2Br with a double bond elsewhere.

Wait, but with two equivalents, perhaps two eliminations happen. So each of the two CH2Br2 groups in the cyclohexadiene loses HBr, forming a double bond. So the cyclohexa-1,3-diene becomes a cyclohexa-1,3,5-diene. So with double bonds at 1,3, and 5.

Alternatively, perhaps the 5 and 6 positions form a new double bond, making the cyclohexadiene into a cyclohexa-1,3,5-triene, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination occurs at each CH2Br2 group, forming a new double bond and releasing HBr. So each CH2Br2 becomes CHBr and a double bond, but that doesn't quite make sense.

Wait, maybe each CH2Br2 group undergoes dehydrohalogenation, losing HBr to form a double bond. So for each CH2Br2, you lose two HBr molecules to form a double bond. So each CH2Br2 → CBr=CH2? No, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, each CH2Br2 group could lose one HBr, becoming CHBr=CH2. But I'm not certain.

Another approach: perhaps the di-dibromomethyl cyclohexadiene is undergoing a substitution reaction with the iodide, replacing Br with I. So each CH2Br2 becomes CH2I2. But then, what's the purpose? Maybe the iodide is a better leaving group for subsequent reactions.

Wait, perhaps product 1 has iodide substituents which are then involved in elimination steps later.

But I'm not making progress. Let me think about the possible structures after each step.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a ring-opening of the bicyclo structure via a nucleophilic attack. The O-t-Bu group is attached to a bridgehead carbon. If it leaves, perhaps the ring opens, and the diene attacks.

Alternatively, perhaps the diene acts as a nucleophile, attacking the bicyclo structure.

Alternatively, considering that the starting material has two double bonds, maybe each of them reacts with the diene in a Diels-Alder fashion.

Wait, if each double bond in the bicyclo compound reacts with a diene, perhaps two Diels-Alder adducts form, leading to a more complex structure.

But I'm not sure. Maybe the initial reaction forms a bridged structure with two new six-membered rings attached.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is a coupling, where the diene and the bicyclo compound form a new bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that requires aromatic rings, which the starting material doesn't have.

Alternatively, perhaps the NaI is a catalyst for some elimination reactions, leading to the formation of more double bonds.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction forms a ring-opened structure. The O-t-Bu group could leave, forming a carbocation, which then reacts with the diene.

But again, O-t-Bu is a poor leaving group, so this might not be feasible without some activation.

Alternatively, perhaps the di-dibromomethyl groups are activated by the NaI, leading to elimination and forming new double bonds, making the cyclohexadiene into a more reactive diene.

Wait, perhaps the cyclohexa-1,3-diene is converted into a more conjugated diene via elimination of the dibromomethyl groups.

But I'm not making progress on this. Let me try to think about the next steps, maybe that will help.

Product 1 is treated with aqueous H2SO4, leading to product 2. H2SO4 is a strong acid and can protonate groups, perhaps leading to ring-opening or dehydration.

Then product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO. SO3 is used for sulfonation, so perhaps product 2 has a hydroxyl group which is then sulfonated.

Finally, product 3 is heated at 150C, perhaps leading to elimination or rearrangement.

Wait, maybe the overall process is synthesizing a sulfonated compound which upon heating eliminates to form a double bond.

But without knowing the exact structures, it's hard to proceed. Let me think about the final product's structure.

If the final product is a bridged bicyclic structure with several substituents, perhaps it has a certain number of distinct Hs.

For example, norbornene derivatives often have symmetry, leading to fewer distinct Hs.

Wait, norbornene (bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene) has a structure where some Hs are equivalent due to symmetry.

If the final product is a norbornene derivative with substituents that are symmetrically placed, perhaps the number of distinct Hs is 4, 7, 8, or 10.

Looking at the options, 7 is one of the choices. So perhaps the final product has 7 distinct Hs.

But how?

Alternatively, if the final product is a molecule with several rings and substituents arranged symmetrically, the number could be lower.

Alternatively, maybe the final product is a cubane-like structure but that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product has multiple rings and substituents leading to 7 distinct Hs.

Wait, perhaps the structure has several equivalent positions. For example, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, some Hs would be equivalent.

Alternatively, the final product could have a bridged bicyclic structure with substituents, leading to 7 distinct Hs.

But without the exact structure, it's hard to be precise.

Alternatively, perhaps the final step is a dehydrohalogenation, leading to a double bond which reduces the number of Hs but increases symmetry.

Wait, perhaps the final product has a ring with several substituents leading to multiple equivalent Hs.

Let me try to think of a specific structure.

Suppose the final product is a tricyclic compound with a norbornene core and some substituents. Let's say it has three rings, and the substituents are in positions that make some Hs equivalent.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a molecule with a bridged bicyclic structure and several substituents, leading to 7 distinct Hs.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a bicyclo structure with several substituents, each in symmetric positions, leading to 7 Hs.

But I'm not entirely sure, so I'll have to make an educated guess based on the steps.

The options are A)8, B)4, C)10, D)7.

I think the correct answer is D)7.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene and leading to a final product, 4. The goal is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Reaction Overview**:
   - The starting material is a bicyclic compound with two double bonds and a tert-butoxy substituent at position 7.
   - It reacts with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide. This step likely involves substitution or elimination, potentially forming a Diels-Alder adduct or modifying the substituents on the cyclohexadiene.
   - Product 1 is then treated with aqueous H₂SO₄, which could protonate or rearrange the structure.
   - Product 2 is treated with SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO, suggesting sulfonation or modification of functional groups.
   - Finally, product 3 is heated at 150°C, likely leading to elimination or rearrangement.

2. **Final Product**:

Answer: D
