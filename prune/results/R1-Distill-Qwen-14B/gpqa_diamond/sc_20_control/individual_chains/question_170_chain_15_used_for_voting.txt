Okay, I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron in a specific spin state. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

So the problem states that the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). I remember that spin states are usually represented as two-component vectors. So this state can be written as a column vector [3i, 4]^T. Right, because spin-1/2 particles have two possible states, up and down.

The expectation value of an operator is calculated as the conjugate transpose of the state vector multiplied by the operator matrix, then multiplied by the state vector. Oh wait, yeah, the formula is <O> = ψ† O ψ, where ψ is the state vector and O is the operator.

In this case, the operator is S_y. But wait, S_y is the spin component operator along the y-axis. I remember that the Pauli matrices are related to the spin operators. The spin operator S is (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli matrix. So S_y would be (ħ/2) σ_y.

The σ_y matrix given is:
[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

So S_y is (ħ/2) times that matrix.

First, I should write down the state vector ψ. It's [3i, 4]^T. To compute the expectation value, I'll need to compute ψ† (which is the conjugate transpose, so [ -3, 4i ]), multiply by S_y, then multiply by ψ.

Wait, actually, let me think step by step. The expectation value is ψ† S_y ψ. But since S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y, I can factor out the (ħ/2) and compute ψ† σ_y ψ, then multiply by (ħ/2).

So let me first compute σ_y multiplied by ψ, then take the conjugate transpose of ψ and multiply by that result.

Let me compute σ_y * ψ first. ψ is [3i,4]^T. So:

σ_y * ψ = [0*3i + (-i)*4, i*3i +0*4 ]^T.
Calculating each component:
First component: 0*(3i) is 0, (-i)*4 is -4i. So the first component is 0 -4i = -4i.
Second component: (i)(3i) + 0*4. 3i times i is 3i², which is 3*(-1) = -3. So the second component is -3 +0 = -3.

So σ_y ψ is [ -4i, -3 ]^T.

Now, I need to compute ψ† (σ_y ψ). ψ† is the conjugate transpose of ψ, which is [ -3, 4i ].

So, ψ† σ_y ψ = [ -3, 4i ] [ -4i, -3 ]^T.

Wait, no. Wait, matrix multiplication. So ψ† is a 1x2 matrix, σ_y ψ is 2x1. So their product is scalar.

Compute each component:

Multiply each element of ψ† with σ_y ψ and sum.

So (-3) * (-4i) + (4i) * (-3).

Let me compute each term:

First term: (-3) * (-4i) = 12i.
Second term: (4i) * (-3) = -12i.

Adding them together: 12i -12i = 0.

Wait, that can't be right. Because then the expectation value would be zero. But looking at the options, none of them are zero. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, maybe I messed up the order of multiplication. Let me double-check. Oh wait, no. The expectation value is ψ† S_y ψ, which is ψ† (σ_y) ψ multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, but according to my calculation, ψ† σ_y ψ is zero, which would make the expectation value zero. Hmm, but the options don't have zero, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Let me go back step by step.

Compute σ_y * ψ:

σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]].

So the first component is (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) = 0 -4i = -4i.

Second component is (i)(3i) + (0)(4) = 3i² + 0 = 3*(-1) = -3.

So σ_y ψ is [ -4i, -3 ]^T. That part seems correct.

Then ψ† is [ -3, 4i ].

So ψ† σ_y ψ = (-3)*(-4i) + (4i)*(-3)

Wait, (-3)*(-4i) is 12i.

(4i)*(-3) is -12i.

Adding 12i -12i gives zero. So the expectation value is (ħ/2) * 0 = 0.

But looking at the options, none of them are zero. So I must have made an error. Maybe I messed up the state vector.

Wait, the problem states the spin state is (3i,4). So the vector is [3i,4]^T, right? Or is it the components in a different order?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the multiplication order. Let me make sure about matrix multiplication. Oh wait, perhaps I should have done ψ† multiplied by σ_y, then multiplied by ψ.

Wait, no. Wait, the expectation value is ψ† (σ_y) ψ. So the order is correct.

Wait, another thought: Oh! Wait, no, the expectation value is ψ† multiplied by σ_y, then multiplied by ψ. But perhaps I should do the multiplication correctly.

Wait, let me re-calculate ψ† σ_y ψ.

Wait, ψ† is a row vector [ -3, 4i ].

σ_y is a 2x2 matrix. So ψ† σ_y would be a 1x2 vector, and then when you multiply by ψ (which is 2x1), you get a scalar.

Wait, perhaps I should compute ψ† σ_y first, then multiply by ψ.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute σ_y ψ, then ψ† times that.

Either way, the result should be the same. Let me try it again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should write it in terms of components.

Wait, another approach: The expectation value is (ψ† σ_y ψ) * (ħ/2).

Let me compute ψ† σ_y ψ.

ψ is [a, b]^T, where a=3i, b=4.

So ψ† = [ a*, b* ] = [ (-3i)*, 4* ] = [ 3, -4i ].

Wait wait, wait, no: ψ is [3i, 4]^T. So ψ† is [ (3i)* , (4)* ] = [ -3, 4i ].

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier in the ψ†.

Wait, complex conjugation: (3i)* is -3i. Because (a + ib)* is a - ib. So (3i) is 0 + 3i, so the conjugate is 0 -3i, which is -3i.

Wait, no. Wait, 3i is 0 + 3i. So the conjugate is 0 -3i. So the correct ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ]? No, wait, wait.

Wait, ψ is [3i,4]^T.

The conjugate transpose would be [ (3i)* , (4)* ].

(3i)* is -3i. (4)* is 4 (since 4 is real).

So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Wait, but earlier I thought it was [ -3, 4i ]. Oh! That's the mistake. I think I messed up the complex conjugation steps.

No, wait, let's correct this. The original state is (3i,4), which as a column vector is [3i,4]^T.

The conjugate transpose (dagger) would have the complex conjugate of each element, and rows and columns swapped. So the first element is the complex conjugate of the first row, which is 3i*. 3i is 0 + 3i, so its conjugate is 0 -3i, which is -3i.

The second element is the conjugate of 4, which is 4.

So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Wait, no. Wait, wait. ψ is a column vector [3i, 4]^T.

So ψ† is a row vector whose elements are the conjugates of ψ's elements, in reverse order. Wait, no, wait. Actually, for a vector [a; b], the conjugate transpose is [a*, b*].

So in our case, a is 3i, so a* is -3i. b is 4, so b* is 4.

So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Wait, no, wait, no, that's not correct. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, if the vector is [3i;4], then ψ† is [3i*, 4* ] → [ -3i,4 ].

Wait, no, no, that can't be right. Wait, 3i is a complex number. So 3i* is -3i, right? Because (a+ib)* is a - ib. So 3i is 0 + 3i, so its complex conjugate is 0 -3i, which is -3i.

So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Wait, but earlier I thought it was [ -3, 4i ]. So where did I go wrong before? I think I confused the conjugate. So in my initial computation, I thought ψ† was [ -3, 4i ], but actually, it should have been [ -3i, 4 ].

So that's where I made the mistake. Let me re-do the calculation with the correct ψ†.

So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Now, σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

So σ_y * ψ is [0*(3i) + (-i)*4, i*(3i) +0*4 ]^T.

Which is [ (0) + (-4i), 3i² + 0 ] → [ -4i, -3 ]^T.

So σ_y ψ is [ -4i, -3 ]^T.

Now, ψ† (σ_y ψ) is [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by [ -4i, -3 ]^T.

So the scalar is (-3i)*(-4i) + (4)*(-3).

Let me compute each term:

First term: (-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i² = 12*(-1) = -12.

Second term: 4*(-3) = -12.

So sum is (-12) + (-12) = -24.

Wait, so ψ† σ_y ψ is -24.

Therefore, the expectation value of S_y is (ħ/2) * (-24) = (-24 ħ)/2 = -12 ħ.

But wait, looking at the options, option A is -12ħ/25. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, but perhaps I messed up the calculation again. Let me recalculate:

Wait, the first term is (-3i) * (-4i) = 12 i² = 12*(-1) = -12.

Second term: 4 * (-3) = -12.

So sum is -12 + (-12) = -24.

So the product is -24, and the expectation value is (ħ/2) * (-24) = -12 ħ.

But none of the options match that. Wait, the options are A) -12 ħ / 25, B) 12 ħ /25, etc.

Hmm, so where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps the state vector was given as (3i,4), but perhaps it's |3i,4>, meaning that it's a two-component vector with components (3i,4), but perhaps it's a normalized vector? Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors should be normalized.

Wait, let me check the normalization. |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = (9) + 16 =25. So the normalization factor is 5. So the state is not normalized.

Oh! So perhaps I should normalize the state vector before computing the expectation value.

Wait, the state is given as (3i,4), which has norm sqrt( (3i)(-3i) +4*4 ) = sqrt(9 +16)=5. So the normalized state is (3i/5, 4/5).

Ah, right, I forgot to normalize the state. Because expectation values are calculated with the normalized state. So the given state might not be normalized, and I need to adjust for that.

So the correct approach is to first normalize the state vector.

So the normalized ψ is (1/5) [3i,4]^T.

Therefore, ψ = [3i/5, 4/5]^T.

Now, ψ† is [ -3/5, 4i/5 ].

So let's recompute everything with the normalized state.

Compute σ_y ψ:

σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

So σ_y ψ = 0*(3i/5) + (-i)*(4/5) for the first component, and i*(3i/5) + 0*(4/5) for the second component.

First component: (-i)(4/5) = (-4i)/5.

Second component: i*(3i/5) = 3i²/5 = 3*(-1)/5 = -3/5.

So σ_y ψ is [ (-4i/5), (-3/5) ]^T.

Now, ψ† is [ -3/5, 4i/5 ].

So ψ† σ_y ψ is [ -3/5, 4i/5 ] multiplied by [ (-4i/5), (-3/5) ].

Compute each term:

First term: (-3/5) * (-4i/5) = (12i)/25.

Second term: (4i/5) * (-3/5) = (-12i)/25.

Adding these two terms: (12i/25) + (-12i/25) = 0.

Wait, so the product is zero again. So the expectation value would be zero, but that's not an option.

Wait, this can't be right. Let me recheck the normalization.

Wait, the given state is (3i,4). The norm squared is |3i|² + |4|² = (9) + (16) =25. So normalization factor is 5. So the normalized vector is (3i/5,4/5).

So the state ψ is [3i/5,4/5]^T.

Now, compute ψ† σ_y ψ.

ψ† is [ -3/5, -4i/5 ].

Wait, wait, because ψ is [3i/5,4/5], so ψ† is [ (3i/5)* , (4/5)* ].

(3i/5)* is (-3i)/5. (4/5)* is 4/5.

So ψ† is [ (-3i/5),4/5 ].

Wait, no, wait:

Wait, the first element is (3i/5)* = (-3i)/5.

The second element is (4/5)* =4/5.

So ψ† is [ (-3i/5), 4/5 ].

So now, σ_y multiplied by ψ:

σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and ψ is [3i/5, 4/5]^T.

So σ_y ψ is:

First component: 0*(3i/5) + (-i)*(4/5) = (-4i)/5.

Second component: i*(3i/5) +0*(4/5) = (3i²)/5 = (-3)/5.

So σ_y ψ is [ (-4i/5), (-3/5) ]^T.

Now, ψ† (σ_y ψ) is [ (-3i/5),4/5 ] multiplied by [ (-4i/5), (-3/5) ].

Compute each part:

First term: (-3i/5) * (-4i/5) = (12 i² )/(25) = (12*(-1))/25 = -12/25.

Second term: (4/5) * (-3/5) = (-12)/25.

Adding these two: (-12/25) + (-12/25) = (-24)/25.

So ψ† σ_y ψ = (-24/25).

Therefore, the expectation value of S_y is (ħ/2) * (-24/25) = (-12 ħ)/25.

Which matches option A: -12 ħ /25.

To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( S_y \), for an electron in the spin state \( (3i, 4) \), we proceed as follows:

1. **State Vector and Normalization**:  
   The given spin state is \( \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \). The norm of this vector is:  
   \[
   \|\psi\| = \sqrt{|3i|^2 + |4|^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = 5.
   \]  
   The normalized state is:  
   \[
   \psi = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{3i}{5} \\ \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Spin Operator \( S_y \)**:  
   The spin operator along the y-direction is related to the Pauli matrix \( \sigma_y \) by:  
   \[
   S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y, \quad \text{where } \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

3. **Expectation Value Formula**:  
   The expectation value of \( S_y \) is given by:  
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \psi^\dagger S_y \psi = \frac{\hbar}{2} \psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi.
   \]

4. **Compute \( \sigma_y \psi \)**:  
   Using \( \psi = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{3i}{5} \\ \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix} \), we calculate:  
   \[
   \sigma_y \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \frac{3i}{5} \\ \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \cdot \frac{3i}{5} + (-i) \cdot \frac{4}{5} \\ i \cdot \frac{3i}{5} + 0 \cdot \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{4i}{5} \\ -\frac{3}{5} \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

5. **Compute \( \psi^\dagger (\sigma_y \psi) \)**:  
   The conjugate transpose of \( \psi \) is:  
   \[
   \psi^\dagger = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{3i}{5} & \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix}.
   \]  
   Multiplying \( \psi^\dagger \) with \( \sigma_y \psi \):  
   \[
   \psi^\dagger (\sigma_y \psi) = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{3i}{5} & \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{4i}{5} \\ -\frac{3}{5} \end{pmatrix}.
   \]  
   Compute each term:  
   - First term: \( \left(-\frac{3i}{5}\right) \cdot \left(-\frac{4i}{5}\right) = \frac{12i^2}{25} = \frac{-12}{25} \).  
   - Second term: \( \frac{4}{5} \cdot \left(-\frac{3}{5}\right) = \frac{-12}{25} \).  
   Adding these:  
   \[
   \psi^\dagger (\sigma_y \psi) = \frac{-12}{25} + \frac{-12}{25} = \frac{-24}{25}.
   \]

6. **Expectation Value of \( S_y \)**:  
   Substituting into \( \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \psi^\dagger (\sigma_y \psi) \):  
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{-24}{25} = \frac{-12 \hbar}{25}.
   \]

7. **Final Answer**:  
   Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:  
   **A) \(-\frac{12 \hbar}{25}\)**.

Answer: A
