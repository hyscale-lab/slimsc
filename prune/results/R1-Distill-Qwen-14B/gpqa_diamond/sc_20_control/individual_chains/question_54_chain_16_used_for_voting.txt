Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which starting material is required to synthesize 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene using ring-closing metathesis. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my metathesis reactions, but I'll try to think it through.

Ring-closing metathesis (RCM) typically involves the reaction of two alkenes, where the catalyst (like Grubbs) facilitates the breaking and reforming of carbon-carbon double bonds. The key here is that the reaction forms a ring by connecting two ends of a diene. So the starting material would have two alkenes positioned in such a way that when they undergo metathesis, they form the cyclohexene ring.

The target molecule is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. The cyclohexene ring will have a double bond between carbons 1 and 2. Then, at carbon 3 and 4, there are two methyl groups. At carbon 5, there's an isopropyl group.

So the ring structure looks like this: positions 1-2 are double-bonded, 3 and 4 have methyl groups, and 5 has an isopropyl. Now, I need to think about how this would form via RCM. RCM usually requires that the two alkenes in the starting material are positioned so that when they undergo metathesis, the appropriate carbons bond to form the ring.

Wait, in RCM, the two alkenes are on adjacent or opposite ends of a diene. The catalyst would break the double bonds and form new ones to make the ring. So the starting material must have two double bonds that can come together to form the cyclohexene.

Let me think about the structure. The target molecule is a six-membered ring with substituents. The starting material would be a diene (with two double bonds) that, when the metathesis occurs, forms the ring.

Wait, no, RCM usually starts with a diene, but the diene is a single conjugated diene. Oh, wait, no, RCM can also involve two separate alkenes in a molecule that are not conjugated. So the starting material is an open-chain diene, perhaps with substituents, and upon metathesis, the ends come together to form a ring.

Wait, another way: ring-closing metathesis involves a single molecule with two alkenes. The catalyst will break both double bonds and recombine the ends. So for a six-membered ring (cyclohexene), the starting material would be an octadiene where the double bonds are positioned such that when the reaction happens, the two ends of the diene come together to form the ring.

Wait, let me think about the number of carbons. The target is a cyclohexene, which is a six-membered ring. So the starting material would have 6 carbons in the ring plus any substituents. Wait, no, the starting material is a diene, which upon metathesis forms a ring. So the diene has a chain long enough that connecting the ends will form a six-membered ring.

Wait, let me think about the number of carbons. If the starting material is an octadiene, then when it forms a ring via RCM, the ring would have 6 members because octa is 8 carbons, so 8 minus 2 (from the two double bonds that are each two carbons) would be 6? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, the diene is such that the distance between the two double bonds is four carbons apart. Because when they metathesize, the two ends would form a new double bond, making a ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an octadiene with two double bonds that are spaced a certain way. Let me imagine the structure.

The target is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. So in the ring, the substituents are at positions 3,4 (two methyl) and 5 (isopropyl). So when we form the ring, those substituents should be in positions that correspond to the starting material's substituents.

So, the starting material is a diene. Let's say it's an octadiene with substituents. The substituents in the target would be on specific carbons. So perhaps the starting material has substituents at positions that, when the ring closes, they end up at 3,4,5 positions.

Let me think about the positions of the double bonds in the starting material. When the metathesis happens, the two alkenes will form new bonds. The RCM process involves the catalyst breaking the two double bonds and then connecting the ends.

Ah, perhaps the starting material is a diene where the double bonds are at 1,2 and 6,7 positions. Wait, but if the molecule is an octadiene, it would have eight carbons. So for example, octa-1,7-diene. Then, upon RCM, the 1,2 double bond and the 7,8 (or 6,7) would react. Wait, no, maybe the diene is in a different arrangement.

Alternatively, the starting material is an octadiene where the two double bonds are such that when they react, the substituents form the correct positions on the ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene. So the structure would be:

CH2=CH-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, octa-1,7-diene would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with substituents.

Wait, let me number the carbons in the starting material. Suppose the starting material is an 8-carbon chain with substituents.

Let me imagine the structure. The target has a cyclohexene ring with substituents at 3,4 (methyl), and 5 (isopropyl). So when the ring closes, those substituents would be in positions that are three positions apart.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diene where the two double bonds are at positions 1,2 and 6,7. So the molecule would be 1,7-diene. Then, during metathesis, the 1,2 double bond would form a bond with the 7,8 (if the chain is 8 carbons), but wait, that would form a ring of 6 members. Because 8 carbons in the chain, with two double bonds.

Wait, actually, the RCM would take the two alkenes and connect them, so the number of carbons in the ring would be (number of carbons between the two double bonds) +1. For example, if the two double bonds are separated by four single bonds, that would make a 6-membered ring. Because 4 + 2 (the two ends) would be 6.

So, in the starting material, the diene has two double bonds that are four single bonds apart. So the structure would be something like: CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with substituents.

Wait, no, perhaps it's more accurate to think that the diene has two double bonds such that the diene is in positions 1,2 and 6,7. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that's only if it's an octa-1,7-diene. But with substituents.

Wait, the substituents in the target are at positions 3,4 (methyl) and 5 (isopropyl). So in the starting material, these substituents would be on the same positions as they are in the target, but perhaps in a linear chain.

Wait, let me think of the starting material as an octadiene. So, the starting material would have a structure like:

CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH(CH3)2)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2?

No, wait, perhaps the substituents would be at positions 3 and 4 and 5 in the chain. So when the ring forms, those substituents end up in the correct positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene. Because when the metathesis occurs, the two double bonds (at 1,2 and 6,7) would form a ring. Wait, but octa-1,6-diene would have double bonds at 1-2 and 6-7, which are five carbons apart. So connecting them would form a 6-membered ring: positions 1,2 (double bond), positions 6,7 (another double bond). So when the metathesis occurs, the 1,2 bond breaks, the 6,7 bond breaks, and the ends 1 and 7 bond, and 2 and 6 bond. Wait, but how does that form a ring?

Wait, perhaps I should consider the positions. The starting material has double bonds at positions 1,2 and 6,7. The chain is eight carbons long. So the structure is:

1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2

But with substituents.

Wait, the substituents in the target are at positions 3,4,5. So in the starting material, substituents would be at positions 3,4,5.

So the starting material would be 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene. Let me visualize that.

Structure:

1      2          3      4      5             6      7      8
CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3)2)-CH2-CH2-CH2

Wait, no, wait. The starting material is an octa-1,6-diene. That means double bonds at 1,2 and 6,7. So positions 1-2 is double bond, and 6-7 is another double bond. So structure would be:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH-CH2

But with substituents at positions 3,4,5.

Wait, but the positions 3,4,5 are the middle of the chain. So when the ring forms, the ends at 1 and 7 would connect, and 2 and 6 would connect.

Wait, but in RCM, the catalyst breaks the double bonds and swaps the ends. So for each double bond, the two carbons on either side of the double bond become the new ends.

So for the first double bond (1-2), the two carbons are 1 and 2. The second double bond is 6-7, so carbons 6 and 7. The catalyst would break both double bonds and form new ones.

So the new double bonds would be between 1 and 7, and 2 and 6. Wait, that doesn't make sense because that would create two new double bonds. Oh, wait, no, in RCM, the process forms a single new double bond as the ring closes.

Hmm, maybe I should think of the RCM as bringing together the ends of the diene. Let me think of the diene as a linear chain with two double bonds, and the metathesis connects the ends to form a ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has a diene where the two double bonds are in positions that, when the ends are joined, the substituents end up in the correct positions.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an octa-1,7-diene with substituents at 3,4,5. Then, when RCM occurs, the 1,2 and 7,8 double bonds would form a ring by connecting 1 to 7 and 2 to 8, but that would create a smaller ring, like a five-membered ring? Wait, no.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the number of carbons between the two double bonds. For a six-membered ring, the two double bonds should be four carbons apart. Because when the ends are connected, the ring would have 6 members.

So, in the starting material, the diene's two double bonds are separated by four single bonds. That way, connecting them forms a six-membered ring.

So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH-CH2. Wait, that's an octa-1,6-diene, but wait, that's seven carbons apart? No, wait, the number of carbons between the two double bonds is four. So the double bonds are at positions 1,2 and 6,7. So the starting material is an octa-1,7-diene? Or octa-1,6-diene?

Wait, the chain is 8 carbons. So if the first double bond is at 1-2, and the second is at 6-7, the number of single bonds between them is 4 (positions 3,4,5,6 are single bonds). Wait, positions 3,4,5,6 are four single bonds. So when RCM occurs, the two double bonds will be transformed into a ring by connecting 1 to 6 and 2 to 7.

Wait, but the starting material is 8 carbons, so when the two ends are connected, the ring would have 6 carbons. Because 1 connects to 6, so the ring is 1-2-3-4-5-6-1? No, that's five members. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of carbons between the two double bonds is five, which when connected, forms a six-membered ring. So the starting material is an octa-1,7-diene. Because 1,2 double bond, then five single bonds to 6,7 double bond. So the distance is five bonds apart.

Wait, that would make the ring size 1,2,3,4,5,6,7—no, that can't be. I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should count the positions. If the starting material is an octadiene with double bonds at 1,2 and 6,7, the distance between the two double bonds is four single bonds (3-4-5-6). So connecting 1 to 6 and 2 to 7 would form a six-membered ring.

Wait, let me imagine the chain as:

1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH-CH2

Wait, no, that's an octa-1,6-diene. So when RCM occurs, the 1,2 and 6,7 double bonds would form a ring. Breaking those double bonds, the ends would connect. So the new structure would have the 1 connected to 6, and 2 connected to 7.

Wait, but that would form a ring from 1 to 6, which is a five-membered ring (since 1-2-3-4-5-6 is five carbons in the ring). Hmm, that's not what we need. We need a six-membered ring.

Ah, perhaps the double bonds are at 1,2 and 5,6. So the starting material is an octa-1,5-diene. Then, the distance between the double bonds is three single bonds (positions 3,4,5). So connecting 1 to 5 and 2 to 6 would form a five-membered ring. No, that's not right.

Wait, maybe I should think of the starting material as a molecule with two double bonds that are spaced so that when the ring forms, the new ring has six members. So, the number of atoms between the two double bonds (including the carbons of the double bonds) should be six.

Wait, for a six-membered ring, the two double bonds need to be separated by four single bonds. So the number of carbons between the two double bonds is four. So the starting material would be an octa-1,5-diene, but wait, that's only four carbons between 1 and 5.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the starting material as octa-1,7-diene. Then, the two double bonds are at 1-2 and 7-8. So the chain is eight carbons, and positions 1 and 7 would be connected, and positions 2 and 8.

But that would form a six-membered ring: 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-1? No, wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, connecting 1 to 7 and 2 to 8 would form a ring that includes positions 1 through 6, making a six-membered ring.

Wait, let's count: if the starting material is octa-1,7-diene, then the ring would be formed by connecting 1 to 7 and 2 to 8. Wait, that would make a seven-membered ring. Because from 1 to 7 is six carbons apart, but when you connect 1 to 7, that's seven carbons in the ring (1,2,3,4,5,6,7).

No, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should approach this differently.

The target is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. So the substituents are at positions 3,4 (methyl), and 5 (isopropyl). Let's number the cyclohexene ring as 1 (double bond to 2), 3,4,5 have substituents.

So the starting material must have these substituents in the correct positions so that when the ring forms, they end up in positions 3,4,5.

Wait, let's think of the starting material as a diene with substituents. The diene has two double bonds, and when they undergo RCM, the substituents end up in the correct positions.

Perhaps the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene. So, the substituents are at 3,4,5, and the double bonds are at 1,2 and 7,8. Then, when RCM occurs, the 1,2 and 7,8 double bonds will form a ring. So when the ring forms, the substituents at 3,4,5 would be in the middle of the ring, which would correspond to positions 3,4,5 in the target.

Wait, let me see. If the starting material is octa-1,7-diene, then the ring formed would have 6 members. Because 8 carbons in the starting material, but two double bonds, each taking two carbons, so when they form the ring, it's 6 carbons.

Wait, no, the number of carbons in the ring would be 8 - 2 (because two double bonds are each two carbons but are now part of the ring) = 6. So that makes sense.

So the starting material is octa-1,7-diene with substituents at 3,4,5. Then, upon RCM, the 1,2 and 7,8 bonds form a ring, creating cyclohexene.

So the substituents are at 3,4,5 in the starting material, which would end up as 3,4,5 in the ring. That fits the target.

So looking at the options, the correct starting material should be option A) 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene.

Wait, but let me check the other options.

Option B: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene. So double bonds at 2,3 and 6,7. If RCM occurs, the ring would be perhaps smaller or in a different position.

Option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene. Double bonds at 1,2 and 6,7. Then, the ring formed would be 6 carbons, but substituents at 3,4,5 would end up in the same positions as in the target.

Wait, no, maybe not. Because the positions in the starting material would be different. If the starting material is octa-1,6-diene, the double bonds are at 1,2 and 6,7. So when the ring forms, the substituents at 3,4,5 would be adjacent to the new double bond.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Alternatively, perhaps using the options, the correct starting material is option C because the double bonds are at 1,6 which are four apart.

Wait, maybe I should think about the structure of the starting material.

The target is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. The substituents are at 3,4,5 in the ring.

In the starting material, those substituents would be at positions 3,4,5 in the chain. So the starting material is an octadiene with substituents at 3,4,5.

The diene in the starting material must have double bonds such that when RCM occurs, the substituents end up in the correct positions.

If the diene is octa-1,7-diene, the substituents are at 3,4,5, which would be in the middle of the chain. When the ring forms, the substituents would end up in positions 3,4,5 of the ring.

Alternatively, if the diene is octa-1,6-diene, then substituents at 3,4,5 would be closer to the 6 position. So when the ring forms, perhaps they would end up in positions 3,4,5.

Wait, perhaps the correct starting material is option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

Because in that structure, the double bonds are at 1,2 and 6,7, which are four carbons apart. So when RCM occurs, the ring formed would have six members, and the substituents at 3,4,5 would end up in positions 3,4,5 of the ring.

So that would make the target molecule.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me try to imagine the starting material as octa-1,6-diene with substituents at 3,4,5.

The structure would be:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3)2)-CH2=CH-CH2

Wait, no, the substituents are 3,4-dimethyl and 5-isopropyl, so it's:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3)2)-CH2-CH2-CH2

No, wait, the double bonds are at positions 1,2 and 6,7. So the structure is:

1   2   3      4      5             6   7   8
CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3)2)-CH2-CH2=CH2

Wait, no, octa-1,6-diene would have double bonds at 1,2 and 6,7. So position 6 is double bonded to 7, and position 1 to 2.

So the structure is:

1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH-CH2

Wait, but substituents at 3,4,5 would be in the middle. When RCM occurs, the 1,2 and 6,7 double bonds form a ring. So the ring would have 6 members because the two double bonds are four carbons apart (positions 1-2, then 3,4,5,6, then 6-7).

Wait, when you break the two double bonds, the catalyst would form new bonds between 1 and 6, and 2 and 7, creating a six-membered ring.

So the substituent at position 3 in the chain would be at position 3 in the ring. Similarly, substituents at 4 and 5 would be in the same positions in the ring.

Thus, the starting material would have the substituents at 3,4,5, and double bonds at 1,2 and 6,7.

Looking at the options, option C is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene, which fits this structure.

Alternatively, option A is octa-1,7-diene, which would have substituents at 3,4,5, but the double bonds are further apart.

Wait, if the starting material is octa-1,7-diene, then the substituents at 3,4,5 would be closer to the middle of a longer chain, but when RCM occurs, the ring would have more than six members.

Hmm, I think I'm getting it backwards. The key is that the number of carbons between the two double bonds in the starting material determines the ring size.

So for a six-membered ring, the number of carbons between the two double bonds must be four. So for example, if the starting material is octa-1,6-diene, the distance between the two double bonds (at 1-2 and 6-7) is four carbons (positions 3,4,5,6). So when the ring closes, it forms a six-membered ring.

So the correct starting material is option C, which is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the starting material needed to synthesize 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene via ring-closing metathesis (RCM), we analyze the structure of the target molecule and the requirements of the reaction. RCM involves a single molecule with two double bonds, where the catalyst breaks these bonds and reforms new bonds to create a ring. The size of the ring depends on the spacing between the two double bonds in the starting material.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Target Molecule**: The target molecule, 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene, is a six-membered cyclohexene ring with:
   - A double bond between carbons 1 and 2.
   - Methyl groups at carbons 3 and 4.
   - An isopropyl group at carbon 5.

2. **Starting Material Requirements**:
   - The starting material must be a diene (a molecule with two double bonds).
   - The two double bonds must be positioned such that, upon RCM, they form a six-membered ring with the substituents at the correct positions (3, 4, and 5).

3. **Ring Formation**:
   - For a six-membered ring, the two double bonds in the starting material must be separated by four single bonds. This ensures that the ring formed has six carbons.
   - The substituents (methyl at 3 and 4, isopropyl at 5) must be positioned in the starting material such that they end up in the correct positions in the target molecule.

4. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A (5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene)**:
     - Double bonds at positions 1,2 and 7,8.
     - The substituents at positions 3,4,5 are in the middle of the chain.
     - This would form a six-membered ring, but the substituents would not align correctly with the target molecule.
   - **Option B (5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene)**:
     - Double bonds at positions 2,3 and 6,7.
     - The substituents at positions 3,4,5 would not align correctly with the target molecule.
   - **Option C (5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene)**:
     - Double bonds at positions 1,2 and 6,7.
     - The substituents at positions 3,4,5 are positioned correctly.
     - The two double bonds are separated by four single bonds, ensuring the formation of a six-membered ring with the substituents in the correct positions.
   - **Option D (4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene)**:
     - The substituents are misplaced and would not align with the target molecule.

### Conclusion:
The correct starting material is **5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene** (Option C), as it satisfies the requirements for RCM to form the target molecule with the correct ring size and substituent positions.

Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which starting material is required to synthesize 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene using ring-closing metathesis. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my metathesis reactions, but I'll try to think it through.

Ring-closing metathesis (RCM) typically involves the reaction of two alkenes, where the catalyst (like Grubbs) facilitates the breaking and reforming of carbon-carbon double bonds. The key here is that the reaction forms a ring by connecting two ends of a diene. So the starting material would have two alkenes positioned in such a way that when they undergo metathesis, they form the cyclohexene ring.

The target molecule is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. The cyclohexene ring will have a double bond between carbons 1 and 2. Then, at carbon 3 and 4, there are two methyl groups. At carbon 5, there's an isopropyl group.

So the ring structure looks like this: positions 1-2 are double-bonded, 3 and 4 have methyl groups, and 5 has an isopropyl. Now, I need to think about how this would form via RCM. RCM usually requires that the two alkenes in the starting material are positioned so that when they undergo metathesis, the appropriate carbons bond to form the ring.

Wait, in RCM, the two alkenes are on adjacent or opposite ends of a diene. The catalyst would break the double bonds and form new ones to make the ring. So the starting material must have two double bonds that can come together to form the cyclohexene.

Let me think about the structure. The target molecule is a six-membered ring with substituents. The starting material would be a diene (with two double bonds) that, when the metathesis occurs, forms the ring.

Wait, no, RCM usually starts with a diene, but the diene is a single conjugated diene. Oh, wait, no, RCM can also involve two separate alkenes in a molecule that are not conjugated. So the starting material is an open-chain diene, perhaps with substituents, and upon metathesis, the ends come together to form a ring.

Wait, another way: ring-closing metathesis involves a single molecule with two alkenes. The catalyst will break both double bonds and recombine the ends. So for a six-membered ring (cyclohexene), the starting material would be an octadiene where the double bonds are positioned such that when the reaction happens, the two ends of the diene come together to form the ring.

Wait, let me think about the number of carbons. The target is a cyclohexene, which is a six-membered ring. So the starting material would have 6 carbons in the ring plus any substituents. Wait, no, the starting material is a diene, which upon metathesis forms a ring. So the diene has a chain long enough that connecting the ends will form a six-membered ring.

Wait, let me think about the number of carbons. If the starting material is an octadiene, then when it forms a ring via RCM, the ring would have 6 members because octa is 8 carbons, so 8 minus 2 (from the two double bonds that are each two carbons) would be 6? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, the diene is such that the distance between the two double bonds is four carbons apart. Because when they metathesize, the two ends would form a new double bond, making a ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an octadiene with two double bonds that are spaced a certain way. Let me imagine the structure.

The target is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. So in the ring, the substituents are at positions 3,4 (two methyl) and 5 (isopropyl). So when we form the ring, those substituents should be in positions that correspond to the starting material's substituents.

So, the starting material is a diene. Let's say it's an octadiene with substituents. The substituents in the target would be on specific carbons. So perhaps the starting material has substituents at positions that, when the ring closes, they end up at 3,4,5 positions.

Let me think about the positions of the double bonds in the starting material. When the metathesis happens, the two alkenes will form new bonds. The RCM process involves the catalyst breaking the two double bonds and then connecting the ends.

Ah, perhaps the starting material is a diene where the double bonds are at 1,2 and 6,7 positions. Wait, but if the molecule is an octadiene, it would have eight carbons. So for example, octa-1,7-diene. Then, upon RCM, the 1,2 double bond and the 7,8 (or 6,7) would react. Wait, no, maybe the diene is in a different arrangement.

Alternatively, the starting material is an octadiene where the two double bonds are such that when they react, the substituents form the correct positions on the ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene. So the structure would be:

CH2=CH-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, octa-1,7-diene would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with substituents.

Wait, let me number the carbons in the starting material. Suppose the starting material is an 8-carbon chain with substituents.

Let me imagine the structure. The target has a cyclohexene ring with substituents at 3,4 (methyl), and 5 (isopropyl). So when the ring closes, those substituents would be in positions that are three positions apart.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diene where the two double bonds are at positions 1,2 and 6,7. So the molecule would be 1,7-diene. Then, during metathesis, the 1,2 double bond would form a bond with the 7,8 (if the chain is 8 carbons), but wait, that would form a ring of 6 members. Because 8 carbons in the chain, with two double bonds.

Wait, actually, the RCM would take the two alkenes and connect them, so the number of carbons in the ring would be (number of carbons between the two double bonds) +1. For example, if the two double bonds are separated by four single bonds, that would make a 6-membered ring. Because 4 + 2 (the two ends) would be 6.

So, in the starting material, the diene has two double bonds that are four single bonds apart. So the structure would be something like: CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with substituents.

Wait, no, perhaps it's more accurate to think that the diene has two double bonds such that the diene is in positions 1,2 and 6,7. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that's only if it's an octa-1,7-diene. But with substituents.

Wait, the substituents in the target are at positions 3,4 (methyl) and 5 (isopropyl). So in the starting material, these substituents would be on the same positions as they are in the target, but perhaps in a linear chain.

Wait, let me think of the starting material as an octadiene. So, the starting material would have a structure like:

CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH(CH3)2)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2?

No, wait, perhaps the substituents would be at positions 3 and 4 and 5 in the chain. So when the ring forms, those substituents end up in the correct positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene. Because when the metathesis occurs, the two double bonds (at 1,2 and 6,7) would form a ring. Wait, but octa-1,6-diene would have double bonds at 1-2 and 6-7, which are five carbons apart. So connecting them would form a 6-membered ring: positions 1,2 (double bond), positions 6,7 (another double bond). So when the metathesis occurs, the 1,2 bond breaks, the 6,7 bond breaks, and the ends 1 and 7 bond, and 2 and 6 bond. Wait, but how does that form a ring?

Wait, perhaps I should consider the positions. The starting material has double bonds at positions 1,2 and 6,7. The chain is eight carbons long. So the structure is:

1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2

But with substituents.

Wait, the substituents in the target are at positions 3,4,5. So in the starting material, substituents would be at positions 3,4,5.

So the starting material would be 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene. Let me visualize that.

Structure:

1      2          3      4      5             6      7      8
CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3)2)-CH2-CH2-CH2

Wait, no, wait. The starting material is an octa-1,6-diene. That means double bonds at 1,2 and 6,7. So positions 1-2 is double bond, and 6-7 is another double bond. So structure would be:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH-CH2

But with substituents at positions 3,4,5.

Wait, but the positions 3,4,5 are the middle of the chain. So when the ring forms, the ends at 1 and 7 would connect, and 2 and 6 would connect.

Wait, but in RCM, the catalyst breaks the double bonds and swaps the ends. So for each double bond, the two carbons on either side of the double bond become the new ends.

So for the first double bond (1-2), the two carbons are 1 and 2. The second double bond is 6-7, so carbons 6 and 7. The catalyst would break both double bonds and form new ones.

So the new double bonds would be between 1 and 7, and 2 and 6. Wait, that doesn't make sense because that would create two new double bonds. Oh, wait, no, in RCM, the process forms a single new double bond as the ring closes.

Hmm, maybe I should think of the RCM as bringing together the ends of the diene. Let me think of the diene as a linear chain with two double bonds, and the metathesis connects the ends to form a ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has a diene where the two double bonds are in positions that, when the ends are joined, the substituents end up in the correct positions.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an octa-1,7-diene with substituents at 3,4,5. Then, when RCM occurs, the 1,2 and 7,8 double bonds would form a ring by connecting 1 to 7 and 2 to 8, but that would create a smaller ring, like a five-membered ring? Wait, no.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the number of carbons between the two double bonds. For a six-membered ring, the two double bonds should be four carbons apart. Because when the ends are connected, the ring would have 6 members.

So, in the starting material, the diene's two double bonds are separated by four single bonds. That way, connecting them forms a six-membered ring.

So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH-CH2. Wait, that's an octa-1,6-diene, but wait, that's seven carbons apart? No, wait, the number of carbons between the two double bonds is four. So the double bonds are at positions 1,2 and 6,7. So the starting material is an octa-1,7-diene? Or octa-1,6-diene?

Wait, the chain is 8 carbons. So if the first double bond is at 1-2, and the second is at 6-7, the number of single bonds between them is 4 (positions 3,4,5,6 are single bonds). Wait, positions 3,4,5,6 are four single bonds. So when RCM occurs, the two double bonds will be transformed into a ring by connecting 1 to 6 and 2 to 7.

Wait, but the starting material is 8 carbons, so when the two ends are connected, the ring would have 6 carbons. Because 1 connects to 6, so the ring is 1-2-3-4-5-6-1? No, that's five members. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of carbons between the two double bonds is five, which when connected, forms a six-membered ring. So the starting material is an octa-1,7-diene. Because 1,2 double bond, then five single bonds to 6,7 double bond. So the distance is five bonds apart.

Wait, that would make the ring size 1,2,3,4,5,6,7—no, that can't be. I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should count the positions. If the starting material is an octadiene with double bonds at 1,2 and 6,7, the distance between the two double bonds is four single bonds (3-4-5-6). So connecting 1 to 6 and 2 to 7 would form a six-membered ring.

Wait, let me imagine the chain as:

1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH-CH2

Wait, no, that's an octa-1,6-diene. So when RCM occurs, the 1,2 and 6,7 double bonds would form a ring. Breaking those double bonds, the ends would connect. So the new structure would have the 1 connected to 6, and 2 connected to 7.

Wait, but that would form a ring from 1 to 6, which is a five-membered ring (since 1-2-3-4-5-6 is five carbons in the ring). Hmm, that's not what we need. We need a six-membered ring.

Ah, perhaps the double bonds are at 1,2 and 5,6. So the starting material is an octa-1,5-diene. Then, the distance between the double bonds is three single bonds (positions 3,4,5). So connecting 1 to 5 and 2 to 6 would form a five-membered ring. No, that's not right.

Wait, maybe I should think of the starting material as a molecule with two double bonds that are spaced so that when the ring forms, the new ring has six members. So, the number of atoms between the two double bonds (including the carbons of the double bonds) should be six.

Wait, for a six-membered ring, the two double bonds need to be separated by four single bonds. So the number of carbons between the two double bonds is four. So the starting material would be an octa-1,5-diene, but wait, that's only four carbons between 1 and 5.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the starting material as octa-1,7-diene. Then, the two double bonds are at 1-2 and 7-8. So the chain is eight carbons, and positions 1 and 7 would be connected, and positions 2 and 8.

But that would form a six-membered ring: 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-1? No, wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, connecting 1 to 7 and 2 to 8 would form a ring that includes positions 1 through 6, making a six-membered ring.

Wait, let's count: if the starting material is octa-1,7-diene, then the ring would be formed by connecting 1 to 7 and 2 to 8. Wait, that would make a seven-membered ring. Because from 1 to 7 is six carbons apart, but when you connect 1 to 7, that's seven carbons in the ring (1,2,3,4,5,6,7).

No, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should approach this differently.

The target is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. So the substituents are at positions 3,4 (methyl), and 5 (isopropyl). Let's number the cyclohexene ring as 1 (double bond to 2), 3,4,5 have substituents.

So the starting material must have these substituents in the correct positions so that when the ring forms, they end up in positions 3,4,5.

Wait, let's think of the starting material as a diene with substituents. The diene has two double bonds, and when they undergo RCM, the substituents end up in the correct positions.

Perhaps the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene. So, the substituents are at 3,4,5, and the double bonds are at 1,2 and 7,8. Then, when RCM occurs, the 1,2 and 7,8 double bonds will form a ring. So when the ring forms, the substituents at 3,4,5 would be in the middle of the ring, which would correspond to positions 3,4,5 in the target.

Wait, let me see. If the starting material is octa-1,7-diene, then the ring formed would have 6 members. Because 8 carbons in the starting material, but two double bonds, each taking two carbons, so when they form the ring, it's 6 carbons.

Wait, no, the number of carbons in the ring would be 8 - 2 (because two double bonds are each two carbons but are now part of the ring) = 6. So that makes sense.

So the starting material is octa-1,7-diene with substituents at 3,4,5. Then, upon RCM, the 1,2 and 7,8 bonds form a ring, creating cyclohexene.

So the substituents are at 3,4,5 in the starting material, which would end up as 3,4,5 in the ring. That fits the target.

So looking at the options, the correct starting material should be option A) 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene.

Wait, but let me check the other options.

Option B: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene. So double bonds at 2,3 and 6,7. If RCM occurs, the ring would be perhaps smaller or in a different position.

Option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene. Double bonds at 1,2 and 6,7. Then, the ring formed would be 6 carbons, but substituents at 3,4,5 would end up in the same positions as in the target.

Wait, no, maybe not. Because the positions in the starting material would be different. If the starting material is octa-1,6-diene, the double bonds are at 1,2 and 6,7. So when the ring forms, the substituents at 3,4,5 would be adjacent to the new double bond.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Alternatively, perhaps using the options, the correct starting material is option C because the double bonds are at 1,6 which are four apart.

Wait, maybe I should think about the structure of the starting material.

The target is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. The substituents are at 3,4,5 in the ring.

In the starting material, those substituents would be at positions 3,4,5 in the chain. So the starting material is an octadiene with substituents at 3,4,5.

The diene in the starting material must have double bonds such that when RCM occurs, the substituents end up in the correct positions.

If the diene is octa-1,7-diene, the substituents are at 3,4,5, which would be in the middle of the chain. When the ring forms, the substituents would end up in positions 3,4,5 of the ring.

Alternatively, if the diene is octa-1,6-diene, then substituents at 3,4,5 would be closer to the 6 position. So when the ring forms, perhaps they would end up in positions 3,4,5.

Wait, perhaps the correct starting material is option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

Because in that structure, the double bonds are at 1,2 and 6,7, which are four carbons apart. So when RCM occurs, the ring formed would have six members, and the substituents at 3,4,5 would end up in positions 3,4,5 of the ring.

So that would make the target molecule.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me try to imagine the starting material as octa-1,6-diene with substituents at 3,4,5.

The structure would be:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3)2)-CH2=CH-CH2

Wait, no, the substituents are 3,4-dimethyl and 5-isopropyl, so it's:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3)2)-CH2-CH2-CH2

No, wait, the double bonds are at positions 1,2 and 6,7. So the structure is:

1   2   3      4      5             6   7   8
CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3)2)-CH2-CH2=CH2

Wait, no, octa-1,6-diene would have double bonds at 1,2 and 6,7. So position 6 is double bonded to 7, and position 1 to 2.

So the structure is:

1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH-CH2

Wait, but substituents at 3,4,5 would be in the middle. When RCM occurs, the 1,2 and 6,7 double bonds form a ring. So the ring would have 6 members because the two double bonds are four carbons apart (positions 1-2, then 3,4,5,6, then 6-7).

Wait, when you break the two double bonds, the catalyst would form new bonds between 1 and 6, and 2 and 7, creating a six-membered ring.

So the substituent at position 3 in the chain would be at position 3 in the ring. Similarly, substituents at 4 and 5 would be in the same positions in the ring.

Thus, the starting material would have the substituents at 3,4,5, and double bonds at 1,2 and 6,7.

Looking at the options, option C is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene, which fits this structure.

Alternatively, option A is octa-1,7-diene, which would have substituents at 3,4,5, but the double bonds are further apart.

Wait, if the starting material is octa-1,7-diene, then the substituents at 3,4,5 would be closer to the middle of a longer chain, but when RCM occurs, the ring would have more than six members.

Hmm, I think I'm getting it backwards. The key is that the number of carbons between the two double bonds in the starting material determines the ring size.

So for a six-membered ring, the number of carbons between the two double bonds must be four. So for example, if the starting material is octa-1,6-diene, the distance between the two double bonds (at 1-2 and 6-7) is four carbons (positions 3,4,5,6). So when the ring closes, it forms a six-membered ring.

So the correct starting material is option C, which is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.


To determine the starting material needed to synthesize 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene via ring-closing metathesis (RCM), we analyze the structure of the target molecule and the requirements of the reaction. RCM involves a single molecule with two double bonds, where the catalyst breaks these bonds and reforms new bonds to create a ring. The size of the ring depends on the spacing between the two double bonds in the starting material.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Target Molecule**: The target molecule, 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene, is a six-membered cyclohexene ring with:
   - A double bond between carbons 1 and 2.
   - Methyl groups at carbons 3 and 4.
   - An isopropyl group at carbon 5.

2. **Starting Material Requirements**:
   - The starting material must be a diene (a molecule with two double bonds).
   - The two double bonds must be positioned such that, upon RCM, they form a six-membered ring with the substituents at the correct positions (3, 4, and 5).

3. **Ring Formation**:
   - For a six-membered ring, the two double bonds in the starting material must be separated by four single bonds. This ensures that the ring formed has six carbons.
   - The substituents (methyl at 3 and 4, isopropyl at 5) must be positioned in the starting material such that they end up in the correct positions in the target molecule.

4. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A (5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene)**:
     - Double bonds at positions 1,2 and 7,8.
     - The substituents at positions 3,4,5 are in the middle of the chain.
     - This would form a six-membered ring, but the substituents would not align correctly with the target molecule.
   - **Option B (5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene)**:
     - Double bonds at positions 2,3 and 6,7.
     - The substituents at positions 3,4,5 would not align correctly with the target molecule.
   - **Option C (5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene)**:
     - Double bonds at positions 1,2 and 6,7.
     - The substituents at positions 3,4,5 are positioned correctly.
     - The two double bonds are separated by four single bonds, ensuring the formation of a six-membered ring with the substituents in the correct positions.
   - **Option D (4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene)**:
     - The substituents are misplaced and would not align with the target molecule.

### Conclusion:
The correct starting material is **5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene** (Option C), as it satisfies the requirements for RCM to form the target molecule with the correct ring size and substituent positions.

Answer: C
