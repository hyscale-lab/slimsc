Okay, so I've got this question about stellar abundances, and I'm a bit rusty on the details, but let me think through it. Alright, the question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars compared to each other. Let me see what data I have.

The two stars are Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun, respectively. But I don't think mass directly affects the abundance ratios, so maybe it's a distractor. 

The elemental abundances are given using the EW method, which I think stands for Equivalent Width. The values are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. So, the ratio of silicon to iron in Star_1 is 0.3 dex higher than the Sun.
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. So, the ratio of magnesium to silicon in Star_2 is 0.3 dex higher than the Sun.
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex. So, the iron abundance in Star_1 is the same as the Sun.
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Magnesium abundance in Star_2 is solar.

The photospheric composition of the Sun is given as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So, nFe/nH = 10^(7.5 -12) = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7. So, nMg/nH = 10^(7-12) = 1e-5.

Wait, what's log10(nX/nH) mean? Oh right, in stellar abundances, the number density ratio is expressed as 12 + log(nX/nH) for hydrogen. So, when they say [X/Y] = log(nX/nY), it's the logarithm of the ratio of their number densities. 

We need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2, so nSi,1 / nSi,2. 

Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's find the silicon abundance in each star relative to hydrogen.

For Star_1:
We know [Fe/H]_1 is 0, which means [Fe/H] = 0. So, the number density of Fe relative to H is the same as the Sun: nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun = 3.16e-5.

We also have [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. [Si/Fe] is log(nSi/nFe). So, 0.3 = log(nSi,1 / nFe,1). Therefore, nSi,1 / nFe,1 = 10^0.3 ≈ 2. So, nSi,1 = 2 * nFe,1.

But nFe,1 is same as Sun's, so nFe,1 = 3.16e-5. So, nSi,1 = 2 * 3.16e-5 ≈ 6.32e-5.

Wait, but wait. Because [Fe/H]_1 is 0, the star's [Fe/H] is same as the Sun. So, the ratio of Fe to H stays the same. So, nFe,1 = (Fe/H)_1 = [Fe/H]_1 = 0, but wait that can't be right. No, [Fe/H] is the logarithmic ratio. Oh wait, [Fe/H] is defined as log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe_sun/nH_sun). Since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, that means log(nFe1/nH1) = log(nFe_sun/nH_sun). So, nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun, which is the same as the Sun. So, the ratio of Fe to H hasn't changed. So, nFe1/nH1 = 3.16e-5.

So, moving on. [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3, so log(nSi1/nFe1) = 0.3 → nSi1/nFe1 = 10^0.3 ≈ 2. So, nSi1 = 2 * nFe1 = 2 * (3.16e-5) ≈ 6.32e-5. So, nSi1 = 6.32e-5 relative to H because nFe1 is 3.16e-5, so nSi1 = 6.32e-5 * (nH1 / nH1) → Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, nFe1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH1. Because [Fe/H] is 0, so nFe1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH1. Similarly, nSi1 = (nSi_sun / nH_sun) * 10^([Si/Fe]_1) * (nFe1 / nFe_sun)?

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to express the number densities in terms of the Sun's.

Let me define the Sun's number densities as:

nFe_sun = 3.16e-5 * nH_sun.

nMg_sun = 1e-5 * nH_sun.

Similarly, for any star, nX = (nX_sun) * 10^([X/Fe]_star) * (nFe_star/nFe_sun).

Wait, no, maybe another approach: [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX_sun/nY_sun) = log((nX/nY)/(nX_sun/nY_sun)) ) = log( (nX / nY) * (nY_sun / nX_sun) ), so [X/Y] = log( (nX / nY) * (nY_sun / nX_sun) ) → (nX / nY) = 10^{[X/Y]} * (nX_sun / nY_sun).

So, for [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3: 

nSi1/nFe1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun).

We know nSi_sun / nFe_sun = (nSi_sun / nH_sun) / (nFe_sun / nH_sun) ) = (10^(7-12)) / (10^(7.5-12)) ) → 10^(-5) / 10^(-4.5) = 10^(-0.5) ≈ 0.316.

So, nSi1/nFe1 = 10^0.3 * 0.316 ≈ 2 * 0.316 ≈ 0.632.

But wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, wait. Let's compute it correctly.

nSi_sun = 10^( (7) - 12 ) * nH_sun = 1e-5 * nH_sun.

nFe_sun = 10^(-4.5) * nH_sun ≈ 3.16e-5 * nH_sun.

So, nSi_sun / nFe_sun = (1e-5) / (3.16e-5) ≈ 0.316.

Thus, nSi1/nFe1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) = 2 * 0.316 ≈ 0.632.

So, nSi1 = 0.632 * nFe1.

But nFe1 = nFe_sun * 10^{[Fe/H]_1} = nFe_sun * 10^0 = nFe_sun.

So, nSi1 = 0.632 * nFe_sun.

Wait, but nFe_sun is 3.16e-5 * nH_sun.

So, nSi1 = 0.632 * 3.16e-5 * nH_sun ≈ 2e-5 * nH_sun.

Wait, but wait, maybe I should express all these in terms of the star's hydrogen, but perhaps it's getting complicated. Let me think in terms of each star's photosphere.

Alternative approach: For each star, express [X/H] as log(nX/nH), so if [X/H] is given, X/H = 10^{[X/H]}.

So, let me compute [Si/H] for each star.

For Star_1:

We have [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → Fe/H = 1. So, nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

We also have [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1) = 0.3 → nSi1/nFe1 = 10^0.3 ≈ 2.

So, nSi1 = 2 * nFe1.

But nFe1 = (Fe/H)_1 * nH1 = (1) * nH1.

So, nSi1 = 2 * nH1.

Wait, that can't be right. Because nFe1 is equal to solar, which is 3.16e-5 nH_sun.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused because nH is the same as the star's hydrogen, not the Sun's. So, for Star_1, H is nH1.

But [Fe/H]_1 is 0, so:

log(nFe1/nH1) = log(nFe_sun / nH_sun) → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun → nFe1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH1.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1) =0.3 → nSi1 = nFe1 * 10^0.3 ≈ nFe1 * 2.

So, nSi1 = 2 * (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH1.

But wait, nFe_sun is 3.16e-5 nH_sun. So, nFe_sun / nH_sun = 3.16e-5.

Thus, nFe1 = 3.16e-5 * nH1.

So, nSi1 = 2 * 3.16e-5 * nH1 = 6.32e-5 nH1.

Hmm, but nH1 is the number density of hydrogen in Star_1. Similarly for Star_2.

Wait, but to find the ratio of silicon in Star_1 and Star_2, we need nSi1 / nSi2.

So, let's compute nSi for both stars.

Star_1:

nSi1 = 2 * (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH1.

But nFe_sun / nH_sun is 3.16e-5, so nSi1 = 2 * 3.16e-5 * nH1 ≈ 6.32e-5 * nH1.

Star_2:

We have [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3. So, log(nMg2/nSi2) =0.3 → nMg2/nSi2 =10^0.3 ≈2 → nMg2 =2 *nSi2.

We also have [Mg/H]_2 =0 → log(nMg2/nH2)=0 → nMg2/nH2 =1 → nMg2 =nH2.

So, from nMg2 =2 *nSi2 → nH2 = 2 *nSi2 → nSi2= nH2/2.

Wait, that's a key point. So, nSi2 = (nH2)/2.

But how is nH2 related to the Sun's? Hmm, because [Mg/H] is 0, for Star_2, nMg2 = nMg_sun * 10^{[Mg/H]_2} = nMg_sun * 1 (since [Mg/H]=0).

Wait, no, I think the approach is similar to Star_1. Since [Mg/H]_2 is 0, nMg2 = nMg_sun * (nH2 / nH_sun).

Wait, no, let me think again.

The [X/H] for a star is defined as log(nX/nH) - log(nX_sun/nH_sun) = log( (nX/nH) / (nX_sun/nH_sun) ) ) = log( (nX / nH) * (nH_sun / nX_sun) ) ).

So, [X/H] = log( (nX /nH ) / (nX_sun /nH_sun) ) = log( (nX / nH ) * (nH_sun / nX_sun) ) )

So, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2 =0 → log( (nMg2/nH2) / (nMg_sun /nH_sun) ) )=0 → (nMg2/nH2) = (nMg_sun /nH_sun) → nMg2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun) * nH2.

Similarly, [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log( (nMg2/nSi2) / (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) ) )=0.3 → (nMg2/nSi2) = 10^0.3 * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun).

We can compute nMg_sun /nSi_sun.

nMg_sun = 1e-5 *nH_sun.

nSi_sun = 1e-5 *nH_sun.

So, nMg_sun /nSi_sun = (1e-5 / 1e-5 ) =1.

So, (nMg2/nSi2) =10^0.3 *1 ≈ 2 → nMg2 =2 *nSi2.

But from [Mg/H]_2, nMg2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun) *nH2 = (1e-5 / nH_sun) *nH2. Wait, no, nMg_sun is 1e-5 nH_sun, so (nMg_sun /nH_sun) is 1e-5.

So, nMg2 = (1e-5) *nH2.

But also, nMg2 =2 *nSi2 → 2 nSi2 =1e-5 *nH2 → nSi2 = (1e-5 *nH2)/2 = 5e-6 *nH2.

So, now, for Star_1, nSi1 =6.32e-5 *nH1.

For Star_2, nSi2 =5e-6 *nH2.

We need the ratio nSi1 /nSi2.

But wait, what's the relation between nH1 and nH2? Oh, right, because the stars' atmospheric parameters aren't given, and we're assuming LTE, but we don't have information about their temperatures or surface gravities. But maybe since the problem is about the ratio of silicon, the hydrogen density will cancel out.

Wait, nH is the number density of hydrogen in each star. But since we don't have any information about the overall hydrogen content (like their [H/Fe] or anything), perhaps we can assume that the ratio of nH1/nH2 is 1? Or wait, the problem doesn't give any other information, so perhaps the ratio of nH1 and nH2 is the same as the ratio of the stars' masses? No, because the stars' masses are given as 1.5 and 1.2 solar masses, but mass doesn't directly translate to hydrogen density. Plus, in stellar atmospheres, the number density is more dependent on temperature and pressure, but without those, maybe we're supposed to assume that the hydrogen density is the same?

Wait, but that doesn't make sense, because the stars have different masses, but without knowing their radii, we can't say anything about nH. Hmm, the question must have a way to find the ratio without needing nH1 and nH2. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the ratio nSi1/nSi2 can be expressed in terms of the ratios involving nH1 and nH2, but without knowing their relationship, maybe the problem is designed so that the ratio of nH1 and nH2 cancels out. Let me check.

nSi1 =6.32e-5 *nH1.

nSi2 =5e-6 *nH2.

So, the ratio is (6.32e-5 /5e-6) * (nH1 /nH2).

But 6.32e-5 /5e-6 = (6.32 /5 ) *10 = approx 1.264 *10=12.64.

So, ratio is 12.64 * (nH1 /nH2).

Hmm, so unless nH1/nH2 is 1, the ratio would be about 12.6. But why would nH1/nH2 be 1? Maybe because the stars have the same metallicity or something? Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Could the problem assume that [H/Fe] is the same for both stars? No, because [Fe/H]_1 is 0, and [Fe/H] for Star_2 isn't given. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that the ratio of nH1 and nH2 can be determined via their [Fe/H] and [Mg/H]. Wait, no, Star_1's [Fe/H] is 0, and Star_2's [Mg/H] is 0, but I don't see a direct way to find nH1/nH2.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think again. The problem gives [Fe/H]_1 = 0, which means [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → log(nFe1/nH1) - log(nFe_sun/nH_sun)=0 → log(nFe1/nH1) = log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun → nFe1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun) *nH1.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2 =0 → nMg2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun) *nH2.

But to find nH1 and nH2, we might need more info. Wait, the problem doesn't give any other constraints. Maybe the stars are assumed to have the same hydrogen density? No, that's not necessarily true.

Wait, but the other elements' abundances are given. Let's think about the ratios.

Wait, another approach: Since nFe1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun) nH1 → nH1 = (nFe1 * nH_sun) / nFe_sun.

Similarly, nH2 = (nMg2 * nH_sun) / nMg_sun.

But from Star_2's [Mg/Si] ratio, nMg2 = 2 nSi2 → and from [Mg/H]_2=0, nMg2= (nMg_sun /nH_sun) *nH2.

Wait, perhaps I can express nH1 and nH2 in terms of nSi1 and nSi2.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio (nH1 /nH2) from nFe1 and nFe2, but I don't know nFe2.

Wait, maybe another approach: Since the problem is only asking for the ratio of silicon in the two stars, perhaps it's possible to express this ratio in terms of the given abundance ratios, without needing the actual hydrogen densities.

Let me see:

We have:

nSi1 = 6.32e-5 *nH1.

nSi2 =5e-6 *nH2.

So, nSi1/nSi2 = (6.32e-5 /5e-6) * (nH1/nH2) = (12.64) * (nH1/nH2).

But without knowing nH1/nH2, I can't proceed. Unless the ratio nH1/nH2 is 1, but why would that be the case? Maybe because both stars have the same [H/Fe], but Star_2's [Fe/H] isn't given. Hmm.

Wait, but for Star_2, [Fe/H] is not given. So, I don't think we can assume that.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the photospheric composition again.

Wait, the Sun's [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12 = -4.5. Wait, no, the Sun's [Fe/H] is given as 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12 = -4.5 → [Fe/H]_sun = -4.5? No, wait, [Fe/H] is defined as log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe_sun/nH_sun). For the Sun, it's zero by definition. So, [Fe/H]_sun =0. So, for the Sun, log(nFe/nH) = log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) = -4.5.

Wait, no, perhaps I got that wrong. The question says, for the Sun, 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) =7.5-12= -4.5 → nFe/nH =1e-4.5 ≈3.16e-5.

Similarly, for Mg: 12 +log(nMg/nH)=7 → log(nMg/nH)=7-12= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

So, for the Sun, nFe/nH=3.16e-5 and nMg/nH=1e-5.

So, for Star_1:

nFe1/nH1=3.16e-5 (since [Fe/H]_1=0 → same as Sun).

nSi1/nFe1=10^0.3 ≈2 → nSi1=2 *nFe1 = 2*(3.16e-5 nH1) =6.32e-5 nH1.

For Star_2:

nMg2/nH2=1e-5 (since [Mg/H]_2=0 → same as Sun).

nMg2/nSi2=10^0.3 ≈2 → nMg2=2 nSi2 → nSi2= nMg2/2 = (1e-5 nH2)/2=5e-6 nH2.

So, nSi1/nSi2= (6.32e-5 nH1)/(5e-6 nH2) )= (6.32e-5 /5e-6) * (nH1/nH2) )= (12.64) * (nH1/nH2).

So, the ratio depends on the ratio of the hydrogen densities. How can we find that?

Wait, perhaps we can relate nH1 and nH2 via the star's overall pressure or something, but without knowing the star's gravity or temperature, that's impossible.

Wait, maybe the stars are main-sequence stars, and their surface gravities can be approximated. For stars on the main sequence, more massive stars have higher surface gravity, which affects the number density. But without knowing their exact radius, I can't compute surface gravity, which is g = (G M)/(R²).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the stars have the same surface gravity, which isn't necessarily true. But that's a stretch.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't considering the H density ratio and just wants the ratio in terms of their [X/Fe] and [X/H] as given, which doesn't include H, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again about how [X/Fe] and [X/H] relate.

For Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1) =0.3 → nSi1= nFe1 *10^0.3.

[Fe/H]_1=0 → log(nFe1/nH1)= log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) → nFe1/nH1= nFe_sun/nH_sun → nFe1 = nFe_sun * (nH1/nH_sun).

So, nSi1 = nFe_sun * (nH1/nH_sun) * 10^0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → log(nMg2/nSi2)=0.3 → nMg2= nSi2 *10^0.3.

[Mg/H]_2=0 → log(nMg2/nH2)= log(nMg_sun/nH_sun) → nMg2= nMg_sun * (nH2/nH_sun).

So, nMg2= nMg_sun * (nH2/nH_sun).

But since nMg2= 10^0.3 *nSi2 → nSi2= nMg2/(10^0.3) = [nMg_sun * (nH2/nH_sun)] / 10^0.3.

So, putting it all together:

nSi1 = nFe_sun * (nH1/nH_sun) * 10^0.3.

nSi2 = [nMg_sun * (nH2/nH_sun)] / 10^0.3.

So, the ratio:

nSi1/nSi2 = [nFe_sun * (nH1/nH_sun) * 10^0.3 ] / [ (nMg_sun * (nH2/nH_sun)) / 10^0.3 ) ]

Simplify:

= [nFe_sun / nMg_sun] * (nH1/nH2) * (10^0.3 * 10^0.3) )

= [nFe_sun / nMg_sun] * (nH1/nH2) * (10^0.6)

We know nFe_sun and nMg_sun in terms of the Sun's hydrogen.

nFe_sun =3.16e-5 nH_sun.

nMg_sun=1e-5 nH_sun.

So, nFe_sun / nMg_sun = (3.16e-5) / (1e-5) )=3.16.

So,

nSi1/nSi2 = 3.16 * (nH1/nH2) * 10^0.6.

10^0.6 is approximately 3.98, so around 4.

So,

nSi1/nSi2 ≈3.16 * (nH1/nH2) *4 ≈12.64 * (nH1/nH2).

But again, we're stuck on the nH ratio.

Wait, perhaps the stars have the same surface gravity. For main-sequence stars, surface gravity g is proportional to M/R².

Assuming both stars are main-sequence, but we don't know their radii. However, if we can relate their radii to their masses, perhaps we can find a relation between nH1 and nH2.

Alternatively, if the stars have the same radius, which is unlikely, but let's see. But without that info, it's impossible.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed such that the ratio nH1/nH2 cancels out, but I don't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in the approach. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps the ratio of the silicon abundances is the same as the ratio of [Si/Fe]_1 and [Si/Fe]_2. But wait, Star_2's [Si/Fe] isn't given. We only have [Mg/Si] for Star_2.

Wait, let's think about the ratios in terms of the Sun's composition.

For Star_1:

nSi1 = nFe1 *10^0.3.

nFe1 = nFe_sun * (nH1/nH_sun).

Similarly, nH1 = (nFe1 / nFe_sun) *nH_sun = (nFe1 /3.16e-5) *nH_sun.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me try to compute the ratio without assuming anything about nH1 and nH2.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects us to assume that the hydrogen densities are the same in both stars, which would make the ratio nSi1/nSi2 ≈12.6. Looking at the options, option B is ~12.6.

Wait, but why would nH1 and nH2 be the same? Because the problem doesn't provide any data on the overall metallicity, except for [Fe/H] and [Mg/H], which are zero for the respective stars.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of nH1 to nH2 is 1. Let's see.

If nH1 =nH2, then the ratio is 12.64, which is option B. But why would nH1 =nH2? The stars have different masses, so their radii would be different, which affects the number density of hydrogen.

Wait, perhaps in the problem, the stars are assumed to have the same metallicity, but that doesn't necessarily imply same H density.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed so that the ratio of silicon is given by the product of the individual ratios:

Star_1's [Si/Fe] is 0.3, Star_2's [Mg/Si] is 0.3. But I don't see a direct connection.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is looking for the ratio of silicon relative to hydrogen in each star, and then taking the ratio of those.

So, [Si/H]_1 = [Fe/H]_1 + [Si/Fe]_1 =0 +0.3=0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2: [Mg/H]_2=0, [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → [Si/H]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Mg/Si]_2 =0 -0.3= -0.3.

So, [Si/H]_1 =0.3, [Si/H]_2= -0.3.

So, the ratio of their [Si/H] is 0.3 - (-0.3) =0.6 dex. But that's not the ratio of their silicon abundances. The actual ratio would be 10^([Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2) )=10^(0.6)= approx 3.98, which is about 4. So, the ratio would be ~3.9, which is option A.

Hmm, that seems more plausible. Maybe the correct approach is to compute the [Si/H] for each star and then take 10^([Si/H]1 - [Si/H]2).

Wait, let's compute [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2.

For Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1=0.3, [Fe/H]_1=0 → [Si/H]_1 = [Fe/H]_1 + [Si/Fe]_1 =0 +0.3=0.3.

For Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → [Mg/H]_2 = [Si/H]_2 + [Mg/Si]_2 → 0 = [Si/H]_2 +0.3 → [Si/H]_2= -0.3.

So, [Si/H]_1 =0.3, [Si/H]_2= -0.3.

Thus, the ratio of nSi1/nSi2 =10^{ ([Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2) }=10^{0.6} ≈3.98, which is about 4. So, the ratio is ~4, which is option A.

Wait, that makes sense. Because [X/H] is log(nX/nH), so the ratio of nX in two stars is 10^{ [X/H]_1 - [X/H]_2 }.

So, in this case, [Si/H]_1 is 0.3, [Si/H]_2 is -0.3. So, the difference is 0.6, and 10^0.6≈3.98.

So, the correct answer should be ~3.9, option A.

To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given abundance data and use the relationships between elemental abundances.

### Key Data:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex: The iron abundance relative to hydrogen is the same as the Sun.
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex: The silicon abundance relative to iron is 0.3 dex higher than the Sun.

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex: The magnesium abundance relative to hydrogen is the same as the Sun.
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex: The magnesium abundance relative to silicon is 0.3 dex higher than the Sun.

3. **Solar Photospheric Composition**:
   - 12 + log₁₀(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log₁₀(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 3.16 × 10⁻⁵.
   - 12 + log₁₀(nMg/nH) = 7 → log₁₀(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH = 1 × 10⁻⁵.

### Analysis:
#### Step 1: Compute [Si/H] for Each Star
- **Star_1**:
  - [Si/H]_1 = [Fe/H]_1 + [Si/Fe]_1 = 0 + 0.3 = 0.3 dex.

- **Star_2**:
  - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex → [Mg/H]_2 = [Si/H]_2 + [Mg/Si]_2.
  - Rearranging: [Si/H]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0 - 0.3 = -0.3 dex.

#### Step 2: Compute the Ratio of Silicon Abundances
The ratio of silicon abundances between Star_1 and Star_2 is given by:

\[
\text{Ratio of } n_{\text{Si,1}} / n_{\text{Si,2}} = 10^{\, [\text{Si/H}]_1 - [\text{Si/H}]_2}.
\]

Substitute the values:
\[
\text{Ratio} = 10^{\, 0.3 - (-0.3)} = 10^{0.6}.
\]

Using \( 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98 \), the ratio of silicon abundances is approximately **3.9**.

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.

ANSWER: A

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this question about stellar abundances, and I'm a bit rusty on the details, but let me think through it. Alright, the question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars compared to each other. Let me see what data I have.

The two stars are Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun, respectively. But I don't think mass directly affects the abundance ratios, so maybe it's a distractor. 

The elemental abundances are given using the EW method, which I think stands for Equivalent Width. The values are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. So, the ratio of silicon to iron in Star_1 is 0.3 dex higher than the Sun.
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. So, the ratio of magnesium to silicon in Star_2 is 0.3 dex higher than the Sun.
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex. So, the iron abundance in Star_1 is the same as the Sun.
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Magnesium abundance in Star_2 is solar.

The photospheric composition of the Sun is given as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So, nFe/nH = 10^(7.5 -12) = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7. So, nMg/nH = 10^(7-12) = 1e-5.

Wait, what's log10(nX/nH) mean? Oh right, in stellar abundances, the number density ratio is expressed as 12 + log(nX/nH) for hydrogen. So, when they say [X/Y] = log(nX/nY), it's the logarithm of the ratio of their number densities. 

We need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2, so nSi,1 / nSi,2. 

Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's find the silicon abundance in each star relative to hydrogen.

For Star_1:
We know [Fe/H]_1 is 0, which means [Fe/H] = 0. So, the number density of Fe relative to H is the same as the Sun: nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun = 3.16e-5.

We also have [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. [Si/Fe] is log(nSi/nFe). So, 0.3 = log(nSi,1 / nFe,1). Therefore, nSi,1 / nFe,1 = 10^0.3 ≈ 2. So, nSi,1 = 2 * nFe,1.

But nFe,1 is same as Sun's, so nFe,1 = 3.16e-5. So, nSi,1 = 2 * 3.16e-5 ≈ 6.32e-5.

Wait, but wait. Because [Fe/H]_1 is 0, the star's [Fe/H] is same as the Sun. So, the ratio of Fe to H stays the same. So, nFe,1 = (Fe/H)_1 = [Fe/H]_1 = 0, but wait that can't be right. No, [Fe/H] is the logarithmic ratio. Oh wait, [Fe/H] is defined as log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe_sun/nH_sun). Since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, that means log(nFe1/nH1) = log(nFe_sun/nH_sun). So, nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun, which is the same as the Sun. So, the ratio of Fe to H hasn't changed. So, nFe1/nH1 = 3.16e-5.

So, moving on. [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3, so log(nSi1/nFe1) = 0.3 → nSi1/nFe1 = 10^0.3 ≈ 2. So, nSi1 = 2 * nFe1 = 2 * (3.16e-5) ≈ 6.32e-5. So, nSi1 = 6.32e-5 relative to H because nFe1 is 3.16e-5, so nSi1 = 6.32e-5 * (nH1 / nH1) → Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, nFe1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH1. Because [Fe/H] is 0, so nFe1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH1. Similarly, nSi1 = (nSi_sun / nH_sun) * 10^([Si/Fe]_1) * (nFe1 / nFe_sun)?

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to express the number densities in terms of the Sun's.

Let me define the Sun's number densities as:

nFe_sun = 3.16e-5 * nH_sun.

nMg_sun = 1e-5 * nH_sun.

Similarly, for any star, nX = (nX_sun) * 10^([X/Fe]_star) * (nFe_star/nFe_sun).

Wait, no, maybe another approach: [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX_sun/nY_sun) = log((nX/nY)/(nX_sun/nY_sun)) ) = log( (nX / nY) * (nY_sun / nX_sun) ), so [X/Y] = log( (nX / nY) * (nY_sun / nX_sun) ) → (nX / nY) = 10^{[X/Y]} * (nX_sun / nY_sun).

So, for [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3: 

nSi1/nFe1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun).

We know nSi_sun / nFe_sun = (nSi_sun / nH_sun) / (nFe_sun / nH_sun) ) = (10^(7-12)) / (10^(7.5-12)) ) → 10^(-5) / 10^(-4.5) = 10^(-0.5) ≈ 0.316.

So, nSi1/nFe1 = 10^0.3 * 0.316 ≈ 2 * 0.316 ≈ 0.632.

But wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, wait. Let's compute it correctly.

nSi_sun = 10^( (7) - 12 ) * nH_sun = 1e-5 * nH_sun.

nFe_sun = 10^(-4.5) * nH_sun ≈ 3.16e-5 * nH_sun.

So, nSi_sun / nFe_sun = (1e-5) / (3.16e-5) ≈ 0.316.

Thus, nSi1/nFe1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) = 2 * 0.316 ≈ 0.632.

So, nSi1 = 0.632 * nFe1.

But nFe1 = nFe_sun * 10^{[Fe/H]_1} = nFe_sun * 10^0 = nFe_sun.

So, nSi1 = 0.632 * nFe_sun.

Wait, but nFe_sun is 3.16e-5 * nH_sun.

So, nSi1 = 0.632 * 3.16e-5 * nH_sun ≈ 2e-5 * nH_sun.

Wait, but wait, maybe I should express all these in terms of the star's hydrogen, but perhaps it's getting complicated. Let me think in terms of each star's photosphere.

Alternative approach: For each star, express [X/H] as log(nX/nH), so if [X/H] is given, X/H = 10^{[X/H]}.

So, let me compute [Si/H] for each star.

For Star_1:

We have [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → Fe/H = 1. So, nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

We also have [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1) = 0.3 → nSi1/nFe1 = 10^0.3 ≈ 2.

So, nSi1 = 2 * nFe1.

But nFe1 = (Fe/H)_1 * nH1 = (1) * nH1.

So, nSi1 = 2 * nH1.

Wait, that can't be right. Because nFe1 is equal to solar, which is 3.16e-5 nH_sun.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused because nH is the same as the star's hydrogen, not the Sun's. So, for Star_1, H is nH1.

But [Fe/H]_1 is 0, so:

log(nFe1/nH1) = log(nFe_sun / nH_sun) → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun → nFe1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH1.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1) =0.3 → nSi1 = nFe1 * 10^0.3 ≈ nFe1 * 2.

So, nSi1 = 2 * (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH1.

But wait, nFe_sun is 3.16e-5 nH_sun. So, nFe_sun / nH_sun = 3.16e-5.

Thus, nFe1 = 3.16e-5 * nH1.

So, nSi1 = 2 * 3.16e-5 * nH1 = 6.32e-5 nH1.

Hmm, but nH1 is the number density of hydrogen in Star_1. Similarly for Star_2.

Wait, but to find the ratio of silicon in Star_1 and Star_2, we need nSi1 / nSi2.

So, let's compute nSi for both stars.

Star_1:

nSi1 = 2 * (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH1.

But nFe_sun / nH_sun is 3.16e-5, so nSi1 = 2 * 3.16e-5 * nH1 ≈ 6.32e-5 * nH1.

Star_2:

We have [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3. So, log(nMg2/nSi2) =0.3 → nMg2/nSi2 =10^0.3 ≈2 → nMg2 =2 *nSi2.

We also have [Mg/H]_2 =0 → log(nMg2/nH2)=0 → nMg2/nH2 =1 → nMg2 =nH2.

So, from nMg2 =2 *nSi2 → nH2 = 2 *nSi2 → nSi2= nH2/2.

Wait, that's a key point. So, nSi2 = (nH2)/2.

But how is nH2 related to the Sun's? Hmm, because [Mg/H] is 0, for Star_2, nMg2 = nMg_sun * 10^{[Mg/H]_2} = nMg_sun * 1 (since [Mg/H]=0).

Wait, no, I think the approach is similar to Star_1. Since [Mg/H]_2 is 0, nMg2 = nMg_sun * (nH2 / nH_sun).

Wait, no, let me think again.

The [X/H] for a star is defined as log(nX/nH) - log(nX_sun/nH_sun) = log( (nX/nH) / (nX_sun/nH_sun) ) ) = log( (nX / nH) * (nH_sun / nX_sun) ) ).

So, [X/H] = log( (nX /nH ) / (nX_sun /nH_sun) ) = log( (nX / nH ) * (nH_sun / nX_sun) ) )

So, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2 =0 → log( (nMg2/nH2) / (nMg_sun /nH_sun) ) )=0 → (nMg2/nH2) = (nMg_sun /nH_sun) → nMg2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun) * nH2.

Similarly, [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log( (nMg2/nSi2) / (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) ) )=0.3 → (nMg2/nSi2) = 10^0.3 * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun).

We can compute nMg_sun /nSi_sun.

nMg_sun = 1e-5 *nH_sun.

nSi_sun = 1e-5 *nH_sun.

So, nMg_sun /nSi_sun = (1e-5 / 1e-5 ) =1.

So, (nMg2/nSi2) =10^0.3 *1 ≈ 2 → nMg2 =2 *nSi2.

But from [Mg/H]_2, nMg2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun) *nH2 = (1e-5 / nH_sun) *nH2. Wait, no, nMg_sun is 1e-5 nH_sun, so (nMg_sun /nH_sun) is 1e-5.

So, nMg2 = (1e-5) *nH2.

But also, nMg2 =2 *nSi2 → 2 nSi2 =1e-5 *nH2 → nSi2 = (1e-5 *nH2)/2 = 5e-6 *nH2.

So, now, for Star_1, nSi1 =6.32e-5 *nH1.

For Star_2, nSi2 =5e-6 *nH2.

We need the ratio nSi1 /nSi2.

But wait, what's the relation between nH1 and nH2? Oh, right, because the stars' atmospheric parameters aren't given, and we're assuming LTE, but we don't have information about their temperatures or surface gravities. But maybe since the problem is about the ratio of silicon, the hydrogen density will cancel out.

Wait, nH is the number density of hydrogen in each star. But since we don't have any information about the overall hydrogen content (like their [H/Fe] or anything), perhaps we can assume that the ratio of nH1/nH2 is 1? Or wait, the problem doesn't give any other information, so perhaps the ratio of nH1 and nH2 is the same as the ratio of the stars' masses? No, because the stars' masses are given as 1.5 and 1.2 solar masses, but mass doesn't directly translate to hydrogen density. Plus, in stellar atmospheres, the number density is more dependent on temperature and pressure, but without those, maybe we're supposed to assume that the hydrogen density is the same?

Wait, but that doesn't make sense, because the stars have different masses, but without knowing their radii, we can't say anything about nH. Hmm, the question must have a way to find the ratio without needing nH1 and nH2. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the ratio nSi1/nSi2 can be expressed in terms of the ratios involving nH1 and nH2, but without knowing their relationship, maybe the problem is designed so that the ratio of nH1 and nH2 cancels out. Let me check.

nSi1 =6.32e-5 *nH1.

nSi2 =5e-6 *nH2.

So, the ratio is (6.32e-5 /5e-6) * (nH1 /nH2).

But 6.32e-5 /5e-6 = (6.32 /5 ) *10 = approx 1.264 *10=12.64.

So, ratio is 12.64 * (nH1 /nH2).

Hmm, so unless nH1/nH2 is 1, the ratio would be about 12.6. But why would nH1/nH2 be 1? Maybe because the stars have the same metallicity or something? Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Could the problem assume that [H/Fe] is the same for both stars? No, because [Fe/H]_1 is 0, and [Fe/H] for Star_2 isn't given. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that the ratio of nH1 and nH2 can be determined via their [Fe/H] and [Mg/H]. Wait, no, Star_1's [Fe/H] is 0, and Star_2's [Mg/H] is 0, but I don't see a direct way to find nH1/nH2.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think again. The problem gives [Fe/H]_1 = 0, which means [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → log(nFe1/nH1) - log(nFe_sun/nH_sun)=0 → log(nFe1/nH1) = log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun → nFe1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun) *nH1.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2 =0 → nMg2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun) *nH2.

But to find nH1 and nH2, we might need more info. Wait, the problem doesn't give any other constraints. Maybe the stars are assumed to have the same hydrogen density? No, that's not necessarily true.

Wait, but the other elements' abundances are given. Let's think about the ratios.

Wait, another approach: Since nFe1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun) nH1 → nH1 = (nFe1 * nH_sun) / nFe_sun.

Similarly, nH2 = (nMg2 * nH_sun) / nMg_sun.

But from Star_2's [Mg/Si] ratio, nMg2 = 2 nSi2 → and from [Mg/H]_2=0, nMg2= (nMg_sun /nH_sun) *nH2.

Wait, perhaps I can express nH1 and nH2 in terms of nSi1 and nSi2.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio (nH1 /nH2) from nFe1 and nFe2, but I don't know nFe2.

Wait, maybe another approach: Since the problem is only asking for the ratio of silicon in the two stars, perhaps it's possible to express this ratio in terms of the given abundance ratios, without needing the actual hydrogen densities.

Let me see:

We have:

nSi1 = 6.32e-5 *nH1.

nSi2 =5e-6 *nH2.

So, nSi1/nSi2 = (6.32e-5 /5e-6) * (nH1/nH2) = (12.64) * (nH1/nH2).

But without knowing nH1/nH2, I can't proceed. Unless the ratio nH1/nH2 is 1, but why would that be the case? Maybe because both stars have the same [H/Fe], but Star_2's [Fe/H] isn't given. Hmm.

Wait, but for Star_2, [Fe/H] is not given. So, I don't think we can assume that.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the photospheric composition again.

Wait, the Sun's [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12 = -4.5. Wait, no, the Sun's [Fe/H] is given as 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12 = -4.5 → [Fe/H]_sun = -4.5? No, wait, [Fe/H] is defined as log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe_sun/nH_sun). For the Sun, it's zero by definition. So, [Fe/H]_sun =0. So, for the Sun, log(nFe/nH) = log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) = -4.5.

Wait, no, perhaps I got that wrong. The question says, for the Sun, 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) =7.5-12= -4.5 → nFe/nH =1e-4.5 ≈3.16e-5.

Similarly, for Mg: 12 +log(nMg/nH)=7 → log(nMg/nH)=7-12= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

So, for the Sun, nFe/nH=3.16e-5 and nMg/nH=1e-5.

So, for Star_1:

nFe1/nH1=3.16e-5 (since [Fe/H]_1=0 → same as Sun).

nSi1/nFe1=10^0.3 ≈2 → nSi1=2 *nFe1 = 2*(3.16e-5 nH1) =6.32e-5 nH1.

For Star_2:

nMg2/nH2=1e-5 (since [Mg/H]_2=0 → same as Sun).

nMg2/nSi2=10^0.3 ≈2 → nMg2=2 nSi2 → nSi2= nMg2/2 = (1e-5 nH2)/2=5e-6 nH2.

So, nSi1/nSi2= (6.32e-5 nH1)/(5e-6 nH2) )= (6.32e-5 /5e-6) * (nH1/nH2) )= (12.64) * (nH1/nH2).

So, the ratio depends on the ratio of the hydrogen densities. How can we find that?

Wait, perhaps we can relate nH1 and nH2 via the star's overall pressure or something, but without knowing the star's gravity or temperature, that's impossible.

Wait, maybe the stars are main-sequence stars, and their surface gravities can be approximated. For stars on the main sequence, more massive stars have higher surface gravity, which affects the number density. But without knowing their exact radius, I can't compute surface gravity, which is g = (G M)/(R²).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the stars have the same surface gravity, which isn't necessarily true. But that's a stretch.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't considering the H density ratio and just wants the ratio in terms of their [X/Fe] and [X/H] as given, which doesn't include H, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again about how [X/Fe] and [X/H] relate.

For Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1) =0.3 → nSi1= nFe1 *10^0.3.

[Fe/H]_1=0 → log(nFe1/nH1)= log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) → nFe1/nH1= nFe_sun/nH_sun → nFe1 = nFe_sun * (nH1/nH_sun).

So, nSi1 = nFe_sun * (nH1/nH_sun) * 10^0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → log(nMg2/nSi2)=0.3 → nMg2= nSi2 *10^0.3.

[Mg/H]_2=0 → log(nMg2/nH2)= log(nMg_sun/nH_sun) → nMg2= nMg_sun * (nH2/nH_sun).

So, nMg2= nMg_sun * (nH2/nH_sun).

But since nMg2= 10^0.3 *nSi2 → nSi2= nMg2/(10^0.3) = [nMg_sun * (nH2/nH_sun)] / 10^0.3.

So, putting it all together:

nSi1 = nFe_sun * (nH1/nH_sun) * 10^0.3.

nSi2 = [nMg_sun * (nH2/nH_sun)] / 10^0.3.

So, the ratio:

nSi1/nSi2 = [nFe_sun * (nH1/nH_sun) * 10^0.3 ] / [ (nMg_sun * (nH2/nH_sun)) / 10^0.3 ) ]

Simplify:

= [nFe_sun / nMg_sun] * (nH1/nH2) * (10^0.3 * 10^0.3) )

= [nFe_sun / nMg_sun] * (nH1/nH2) * (10^0.6)

We know nFe_sun and nMg_sun in terms of the Sun's hydrogen.

nFe_sun =3.16e-5 nH_sun.

nMg_sun=1e-5 nH_sun.

So, nFe_sun / nMg_sun = (3.16e-5) / (1e-5) )=3.16.

So,

nSi1/nSi2 = 3.16 * (nH1/nH2) * 10^0.6.

10^0.6 is approximately 3.98, so around 4.

So,

nSi1/nSi2 ≈3.16 * (nH1/nH2) *4 ≈12.64 * (nH1/nH2).

But again, we're stuck on the nH ratio.

Wait, perhaps the stars have the same surface gravity. For main-sequence stars, surface gravity g is proportional to M/R².

Assuming both stars are main-sequence, but we don't know their radii. However, if we can relate their radii to their masses, perhaps we can find a relation between nH1 and nH2.

Alternatively, if the stars have the same radius, which is unlikely, but let's see. But without that info, it's impossible.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed such that the ratio nH1/nH2 cancels out, but I don't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in the approach. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps the ratio of the silicon abundances is the same as the ratio of [Si/Fe]_1 and [Si/Fe]_2. But wait, Star_2's [Si/Fe] isn't given. We only have [Mg/Si] for Star_2.

Wait, let's think about the ratios in terms of the Sun's composition.

For Star_1:

nSi1 = nFe1 *10^0.3.

nFe1 = nFe_sun * (nH1/nH_sun).

Similarly, nH1 = (nFe1 / nFe_sun) *nH_sun = (nFe1 /3.16e-5) *nH_sun.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me try to compute the ratio without assuming anything about nH1 and nH2.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects us to assume that the hydrogen densities are the same in both stars, which would make the ratio nSi1/nSi2 ≈12.6. Looking at the options, option B is ~12.6.

Wait, but why would nH1 and nH2 be the same? Because the problem doesn't provide any data on the overall metallicity, except for [Fe/H] and [Mg/H], which are zero for the respective stars.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of nH1 to nH2 is 1. Let's see.

If nH1 =nH2, then the ratio is 12.64, which is option B. But why would nH1 =nH2? The stars have different masses, so their radii would be different, which affects the number density of hydrogen.

Wait, perhaps in the problem, the stars are assumed to have the same metallicity, but that doesn't necessarily imply same H density.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed so that the ratio of silicon is given by the product of the individual ratios:

Star_1's [Si/Fe] is 0.3, Star_2's [Mg/Si] is 0.3. But I don't see a direct connection.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is looking for the ratio of silicon relative to hydrogen in each star, and then taking the ratio of those.

So, [Si/H]_1 = [Fe/H]_1 + [Si/Fe]_1 =0 +0.3=0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2: [Mg/H]_2=0, [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → [Si/H]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Mg/Si]_2 =0 -0.3= -0.3.

So, [Si/H]_1 =0.3, [Si/H]_2= -0.3.

So, the ratio of their [Si/H] is 0.3 - (-0.3) =0.6 dex. But that's not the ratio of their silicon abundances. The actual ratio would be 10^([Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2) )=10^(0.6)= approx 3.98, which is about 4. So, the ratio would be ~3.9, which is option A.

Hmm, that seems more plausible. Maybe the correct approach is to compute the [Si/H] for each star and then take 10^([Si/H]1 - [Si/H]2).

Wait, let's compute [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2.

For Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1=0.3, [Fe/H]_1=0 → [Si/H]_1 = [Fe/H]_1 + [Si/Fe]_1 =0 +0.3=0.3.

For Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → [Mg/H]_2 = [Si/H]_2 + [Mg/Si]_2 → 0 = [Si/H]_2 +0.3 → [Si/H]_2= -0.3.

So, [Si/H]_1 =0.3, [Si/H]_2= -0.3.

Thus, the ratio of nSi1/nSi2 =10^{ ([Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2) }=10^{0.6} ≈3.98, which is about 4. So, the ratio is ~4, which is option A.

Wait, that makes sense. Because [X/H] is log(nX/nH), so the ratio of nX in two stars is 10^{ [X/H]_1 - [X/H]_2 }.

So, in this case, [Si/H]_1 is 0.3, [Si/H]_2 is -0.3. So, the difference is 0.6, and 10^0.6≈3.98.

So, the correct answer should be ~3.9, option A.


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given abundance data and use the relationships between elemental abundances.

### Key Data:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex: The iron abundance relative to hydrogen is the same as the Sun.
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex: The silicon abundance relative to iron is 0.3 dex higher than the Sun.

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex: The magnesium abundance relative to hydrogen is the same as the Sun.
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex: The magnesium abundance relative to silicon is 0.3 dex higher than the Sun.

3. **Solar Photospheric Composition**:
   - 12 + log₁₀(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log₁₀(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 3.16 × 10⁻⁵.
   - 12 + log₁₀(nMg/nH) = 7 → log₁₀(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH = 1 × 10⁻⁵.

### Analysis:
#### Step 1: Compute [Si/H] for Each Star
- **Star_1**:
  - [Si/H]_1 = [Fe/H]_1 + [Si/Fe]_1 = 0 + 0.3 = 0.3 dex.

- **Star_2**:
  - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex → [Mg/H]_2 = [Si/H]_2 + [Mg/Si]_2.
  - Rearranging: [Si/H]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0 - 0.3 = -0.3 dex.

#### Step 2: Compute the Ratio of Silicon Abundances
The ratio of silicon abundances between Star_1 and Star_2 is given by:

\[
\text{Ratio of } n_{\text{Si,1}} / n_{\text{Si,2}} = 10^{\, [\text{Si/H}]_1 - [\text{Si/H}]_2}.
\]

Substitute the values:
\[
\text{Ratio} = 10^{\, 0.3 - (-0.3)} = 10^{0.6}.
\]

Using \( 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98 \), the ratio of silicon abundances is approximately **3.9**.

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.
