Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

Alright, the problem is about an atomic nucleus undergoing spontaneous fission. The nucleus is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. When it splits, it becomes two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. Also, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. We're told to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the value calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation. The options are given in MeV, so the answer should be a small value compared to the initial energy, probably because relativistic effects are small here.

Hmm. Let's break this down. First, let's figure out the masses of the two fragments.

The initial mass is M, and the total rest-mass after fission is 0.99M. So, the rest mass of the two fragments is 99% of the original. But wait, the problem says that one fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of their rest masses. So, let me denote the mass of the lighter fragment as m. Then the heavier one would be 2m. So, m + 2m =3m =0.99 M. So, 3m = 0.99 M → m= 0.33 M, and the heavier fragment is 0.66 M. Wait, but 0.33 + 0.66 is 0.99, which matches.

Wait, but wait. The initial nucleus has a rest mass energy of 300 GeV. So, the rest mass energy of each fragment is m*c² and 2m*c². So, m + 2m =3m =0.99 M. So, each fragment's mass is 0.33 M and 0.66 M. But wait, M is the initial rest mass. Hmm, but the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV. So, M c² =300 GeV. So, the rest mass energies of the fragments are 0.33 M c² and 0.66 M c².

But wait, their sum is 0.99 M c², which is 297 GeV. So, the total rest mass after fission is 297 GeV, which is less than the initial 300 GeV. So, the difference is 3 GeV. That's the mass defect, which would be converted into binding energy, which in turn would be the kinetic energy of the fragments.

So, when the nucleus splits, the mass decreases, and the released energy is the kinetic energy of the two fragments.

Wait, but in a real fission reaction, the total rest mass before and after must include binding energy. But maybe in this problem, it's simplified. So, the initial nucleus is at rest, and after fission, the two fragments move in opposite directions due to conservation of momentum.

Since the initial momentum is zero, the total momentum after fission must also be zero. So, the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

So, if the masses are m1=0.33M and m2=0.66M, let me denote their velocities as v1 and v2. But wait, since momentum is mass times velocity, their momenta must be equal and opposite. So, m1 v1 = - m2 v2. Or m1 v1 = m2 (-v2), so m1 v1 = m2 v2.

Wait, but in terms of magnitude, m1 v1 = m2 v2. But since m2 is twice m1, m2 =2 m1, so m1 v1 = 2 m1 v2 → v1 = 2 v2.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. Momentum p1 = m1 v1, p2 = m2 v2.

Because the nucleus was at rest, p1 + p2 =0 → p1 = -p2. So, m1 v1 = - m2 v2. So, the magnitudes are equal: m1 v1 = m2 v2. So, v1 = (m2 / m1) v2. Since m2 is twice m1, v1 = 2 v2.

But wait, is that correct? Let me see: m1 v1 = m2 v2 → v1 = (m2/m1) v2. Since m2 is 2 m1, v1 = 2 v2. So, the lighter fragment (m1) has twice the velocity of the heavier (m2), but in the opposite direction.

Now, the next step is to compute the kinetic energies of the two fragments. But the question is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1.

In the classical approximation, kinetic energy is (1/2) m v². But the correct approach would be relativistic, since the velocities might be significant fractions of the speed of light. But wait, given that the initial nucleus is 300 GeV, which is a huge energy, but the mass of each fragment is a significant fraction of that, so perhaps the velocities aren't relativistic. But I'm not sure. Let me proceed.

So, the problem asks for the difference between the correct T1 and the classical approximation T1_classical. So, I need to compute T1 (relativistic) and T1_classical, then find T1 - T1_classical, which would be the difference.

Alternatively, the question might be which one is larger. But the options are in the 10s of MeV, so perhaps the relativistic effects are small but non-negligible.

But first, let's compute the energies.

Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the total energy after fission must include the rest masses of the two fragments plus their kinetic energies. But wait, the initial rest energy is M c² = 300 GeV. The total rest energy of the fragments is 0.99 M c² = 297 GeV. So, the difference is 3 GeV, which must be the total kinetic energy of the two fragments.

So, K1 + K2 =3 GeV.

But since the fragments are moving, their kinetic energies are their total energies minus their rest energies.

So, total energy of fragment 1: E1 = gamma m1 c².

Similarly, E2 = gamma m2 c².

But since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total energy is E1 + E2 = M c² + K1 + K2 = 300 GeV.

Wait, no: the initial energy is M c², which is entirely rest energy. After fission, the two fragments have rest energies m1 c² and m2 c², plus their kinetic energies K1 and K2. So, M c² = (m1 c² + K1) + (m2 c² + K2).

So, M c² = (m1 + m2) c² + (K1 + K2).

But m1 + m2 =0.99 M, so 300 GeV = 0.99 M c² + (K1 + K2).

Wait, wait no, because M c² is 300 GeV. So, 300 GeV = (0.99 M c²) + (K1 + K2).

So, K1 + K2 =300 GeV - 0.99 M c².

But M c² is 300 GeV, so K1 + K2 =3 GeV.

So, the sum of their kinetic energies is 3 GeV, which is 3000 MeV.

Now, I need to find T1, which is K1 for the more massive fragment. No, wait, wait: the more massive fragment is m2=0.66 M. So, T1 is K2, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment.

Wait, the question says: "the more massive fragment is twice as massive as the other. The sum of rest-masses is 99% of M." So, the fragments are m and 2m, with m +2m=3m=0.99 M. So, m=0.33 M, and 2m=0.66 M. So, the more massive is the 0.66 M fragment. So, T1 is its kinetic energy.

So, we have K1 (light fragment) + K2 (heavy fragment) =3 GeV.

But we can also find the relationship between K1 and K2 using the momentum conservation.

Because the initial momentum is zero, the total momentum after is zero. So, m1 v1 = m2 v2.

Wait, but in relativistic terms, momentum isn't just mv. So, the correct approach is to use relativistic momentum.

The momentum of each fragment is p = gamma m v. So, for the two fragments, p1 = gamma1 m1 v1, p2 = gamma2 m2 v2.

And because they move in opposite directions, p1 = - p2.

So, gamma1 m1 v1 = - gamma2 m2 v2.

But considering magnitudes, gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

Hmm. So, that's one equation.

Another equation is the sum of the kinetic energies: K1 + K2 =3 GeV. And K1 = (gamma1 -1) m1 c², K2= (gamma2 -1) m2 c².

So, let's write that:

(gamma1 -1) m1 c² + (gamma2-1) m2 c²=3 GeV.

But m1 is 0.33 M, m2 is 0.66 M. So,

(gamma1 -1)(0.33 M c²) + (gamma2-1)(0.66 M c²) =3 GeV.

But M c² is 300 GeV, so this becomes:

(0.33 * (gamma1 -1) ) *300 GeV + (0.66 (gamma2 -1 )) *300 GeV =3 GeV.

Simplify:

300 GeV [ 0.33 (gamma1 -1) + 0.66 (gamma2 -1) ] =3 GeV.

Divide both sides by 300 GeV:

0.33 (gamma1 -1) + 0.66 (gamma2 -1) = 3 GeV / 300 GeV = 0.01.

So,

0.33 gamma1 -0.33 + 0.66 gamma2 - 0.66 =0.01.

Combine terms:

0.33 gamma1 + 0.66 gamma2 - (0.33 +0.66) =0.01.

0.33 gamma1 + 0.66 gamma2 - 0.99 =0.01 → 0.33 gamma1 + 0.66 gamma2 =1.

So, equation (1): 0.33 gamma1 + 0.66 gamma2 =1.

Now, the other equation from momentum conservation.

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But v1 and v2 are velocities of the two fragments. Let me write this as:

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But v1 is the velocity of the light fragment, and v2 is the velocity of the heavy fragment.

Wait, but in opposite directions, so the speeds are positive in magnitude. So, perhaps considering their magnitudes, the equation is:

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But m2 = 2 m1, so substituting:

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 (2 m1) v2 → gamma1 v1 = 2 gamma2 v2.

Hmm, that's equation (2).

Now, perhaps we can express v1 in terms of v2, but in relativistic terms, it's more complicated because gamma depends on v.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the relation between velocities and gamma.

But this seems a bit complicated. Another approach is to model the problem in the center of mass (COM) frame, but since the initial nucleus is at rest, the COM frame is the same as the initial rest frame.

Wait, but in any case, perhaps it's easier to express gamma2 in terms of gamma1 using equation (2).

But equation (2): gamma1 v1 = 2 gamma2 v2.

Wait, but I'm not sure how to proceed. Alternatively, perhaps I can relate the kinetic energies and velocities using the expressions for gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express gamma in terms of velocity. Let me think.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So, v = c sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²).

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I can write the velocities in terms of beta (β = v/c). So, beta1 = v1/c, beta2 =v2/c.

Then, equation (2) becomes:

gamma1 beta1 = 2 gamma2 beta2.

But, gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta²). So, sqrt(1 - beta²) = 1/gamma → beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²).

So, v1 = beta1 c = c sqrt(1 -1/gamma1^2 ), and similarly for v2.

Substituting into equation (2):

gamma1 * sqrt(1 -1/gamma1^2 ) = 2 gamma2 * sqrt(1 -1/gamma2^2 ).

Hmm, that's a bit complicated, but maybe manageable.

Alternatively, perhaps let me make an approximation. Since the masses are not extremely relativistic, the velocities might be small, so gamma might be close to 1. Let me check.

The initial nucleus has rest mass 300 GeV. The fragments are 0.33 M (100 GeV) and 0.66 M (200 GeV). Their kinetic energies are a small fraction of their rest energies. Wait, but 3 GeV is the total KE, so each fragment's KE is of the order of a few MeV? Because 3 GeV is 3000 MeV, so each fragment's KE would be a few hundred MeV. Wait, but 0.33 M is 100 GeV, so 0.33 M * c² is 100 GeV. So, if the KE is, say, a few hundred MeV, then gamma would be about 1 + (KE)/(m c²). For the lighter fragment, KE is say, a few hundred MeV, which is much less than 100 GeV, so gamma is close to 1. So, perhaps a non-relativistic approximation is acceptable, but the problem asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) and the classical (non-relativistic) T1.

So, perhaps I can proceed with the classical approximation first, then compute the relativistic correction.

Let's compute the kinetic energies using the classical approach.

In the classical approximation, KE = (1/2) m v². Also, since momentum is conserved, m1 v1 = m2 v2.

So, m1 v1 = m2 v2 → v1 = (m2/m1) v2.

Because m2 =2 m1, this becomes v1 =2 v2.

So, the velocities are related by v1=2 v2.

Now, the kinetic energies are:

K_class1 = (1/2) m1 (v1)^2 = (1/2) m1 (4 v2^2) )= 2 m1 v2^2.

K_class2 = (1/2) m2 (v2)^2.

But m2=2 m1, so K_class2= (1/2)(2 m1) (v2^2) )= m1 v2^2.

So, K_class1 =2 m1 v2^2, K_class2= m1 v2^2.

But the sum K_class1 + K_class2 =3 m1 v2^2 =3 GeV.

So, 3 m1 v2^2=3 GeV → m1 v2² =1 GeV.

But m1 is 0.33 M, and M c²=300 GeV. So, m1=0.33 M, so m1 c²=0.33*300=99 GeV.

But in the classical approach, KE is (1/2) m v². Wait, but m1 v2² = (m1 c^2)(v²/c²) ) * (1/(c^2)) ) → wait, maybe I should express this differently.

Wait, m1 v2² = (m1 c²) (v2²)/(c²) ) → so m1 v2² = (m1 c²) (beta2^2), where beta2= v2/c.

So, from the above, m1 v2² = (m1 c²) beta2² = 99 GeV * beta2^2.

But from the sum of the classical KEs, 3 m1 v2^2=3 GeV → 3 * (99 GeV) * beta2^2 =3 GeV → 297 GeV beta2^2=3 GeV → beta2^2=3/(297) =1/99 → beta2=1/sqrt(99) ≈ 0.1005.

So, beta2≈0.1005 → v2≈0.1005 c.

So, the velocities are v2=0.1005 c, v1=2*0.1005 c=0.201 c.

Now, compute the classical kinetic energies:

K_class1 = (1/2) m1 v1² = (1/2)* (0.33 M) * (0.201 c)^2.

But M c² =300 GeV, so M =300 GeV / c².

So,

K_class1 =0.5 * 0.33 * (300 GeV /c²) * (0.201 c )^2.

Simplify:

= 0.5 * 0.33 * 300 * 0.201^2 * GeV.

Compute the numerical value:

0.5 *0.33=0.165.

0.165 *300=49.5.

49.5 * (0.040401) ≈49.5 *0.0404≈2.004 GeV.

Similarly, K_class2 = (1/2) m2 v2² =0.5 * 0.66 M * (0.1005 c)^2.

= 0.5 *0.66 *300 GeV/c² * (0.1005 c)^2.

=0.33 *300 * (0.1005)^2 * GeV.

0.33 *300=99.

99 *0.0101 →approx 1.0 GeV.

So, K_class1≈2 GeV, K_class2≈1 GeV.

But wait, the sum is 3 GeV, which matches. So, the more massive fragment's classical KE is 1 GeV, which is 1000 MeV.

But wait, the problem asks for the difference between the correct T1 and the classical T1. So, perhaps the correct T1 is a bit higher or lower?

Wait, in the classical approximation, we assumed that KE is (1/2) m v², but in reality, the kinetic energy in relativity is (gamma -1) m c².

Since the fragments are moving at velocities around 0.1c, their gamma factors would be sqrt(1/(1- beta^2)).

For beta=0.1, gamma≈1.005025. So, gamma-1≈0.005025.

So, the relativistic KE would be (gamma-1) m c².

So, let's compute the correct T1 (relativistic) for the heavy fragment.

First, get the velocity of the heavy fragment, which is v2=0.1005 c.

So, beta=0.1005.

Gamma=1/sqrt(1 - beta^2) =1/sqrt(1 - (0.0101)) =1/sqrt(0.9899)≈1.005025.

So, T1_rel= (gamma-1) m2 c².

m2 c²=0.66 *300 GeV =198 GeV.

So,

T1_rel=(1.005025 -1 ) *198 GeV =0.005025 *198 → approximately 1.000 GeV.

Wait, 0.005025 *200=1.005 GeV, but 198 is 1.0 less, so 1.005 - 0.005025*2= 1.005 -0.01005= 0.99495 GeV. Approximately 0.995 GeV, which is about 995 MeV.

Wait, but that's for the heavy fragment.

Wait, but wait. In the classical approximation, we found T1_classical=1 GeV, or 1000 MeV. The relativistic value is about 995 MeV.

So, the difference would be T1_class - T1_rel =1000 -995=5 MeV. But wait, that would be a negative difference if we consider T1_rel - T1_class. Wait, let's see.

Wait, in the classical case, K_class2 is 1 GeV, but in reality, it's about 995 MeV. So, the correct T1 is 995 MeV, and the classical approximation is 1000 MeV. So, the difference (correct minus classical) is 995-1000= -5 MeV. But the question says, what is the difference between the correct T1 and the classical T1. So, it's -5 MeV, but since the options are positive, perhaps the absolute value is 5 MeV. So, the correct T1 is less than the classical value by 5 MeV.

So, the answer would be 5 MeV, which is option B.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, when I calculated gamma, beta was 0.1005, so beta²=0.0101.

So, 1-beta²=0.9899 → sqrt(0.9899)=0.9949 → gamma=1/0.9949≈1.00507.

So, gamma=1.00507.

Gamma-1=0.00507.

So, T1_rel=(gamma-1) * m2 c^2 =0.00507 *198 GeV.

0.00507 *198= let's compute that.

0.00507 *200=1.014. So, 0.00507*(200-2)=1.014 -0.01014=1.00386 GeV.

Wait, but 198 is 200-2, so:

0.00507 *198 = 0.00507*(200-2)=0.00507*200=1.014 -0.00507*2=0.01014 → 1.014 -0.01014=1.00386 GeV.

So, approximately 1.004 GeV, which is 1004 MeV.

Wait, that's about 1004 MeV. So, the relativistic T1 is 1004 MeV, and the classical was 1000 MeV.

So, the difference is 1004 -1000=4 MeV. Hmm, but that's not matching my earlier calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier approximation.

Wait, wait. The fragment 2's beta is v2/c =0.1005, so gamma is 1.00507.

So, fragment 2's KE is (gamma-1)*m2 c².

m2 c^2= 0.66 *300=198 GeV.

So, T1_rel=(1.00507-1)*198 =0.00507 *198.

Compute 0.00507 *198: let's do 0.005 *198=0.99, and 0.00007 *198=0.01386. So total is 0.99 +0.01386=1.00386 GeV, which is 1003.86 MeV.

So, the relativistic KE is approximately 1003.86 MeV.

The classical KE was 1000 MeV. So, the difference is 1003.86-1000=3.86 MeV, which is approximately 4 MeV. But that's not one of the options. Wait, the options are 2, 5, 10,20 MeV.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the classical approximation. Let me recheck.

In the classical approach, the total KE is 3 GeV, as per the problem statement. So, from the earlier steps, the sum of the classical KEs is 3 GeV.

In the classical case, the heavy fragment's KE is 1 GeV, the light is 2 GeV. So, that adds to 3 GeV.

But wait, when I calculated the velocities, I got v1=0.201 c, v2=0.1005 c.

So, for the heavy fragment, K_class= (1/2)* m2 v2^2 =0.5 * 0.66 M * (0.1005 c)^2.

Wait, M c² is 300 GeV, so M=300 GeV/c².

Thus,

K_class=0.5 *0.66 * (300 GeV) * (0.1005)^2.

Wait, that would be 0.5 *0.66 *300 * (0.010100).

Compute the constants:

0.5 *0.66=0.33.

300 *0.33=99.

99 *0.010100≈1.0 GeV.

So, K_class=1 GeV.

But in reality, the relativistic KE is about 1003.86 MeV, which is 1.00386 GeV.

So, the difference is 1.00386 -1.0=0.00386 GeV, which is 3.86 MeV. Hmm, that's about 4 MeV, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption about the velocity. Let me think again. Because in the classical approach, the velocity is calculated as v2=0.1005 c, but in reality, the velocity is higher because of the relativistic effects.

Wait, perhaps the velocity isn't as high as 0.1c because the gamma factor is small.

Wait, perhaps I should set up the equations properly without the classical approximation.

Let me go back to the two main equations.

Equation (1): 0.33 gamma1 + 0.66 gamma2 =1.

Equation (2): gamma1 beta1 = 2 gamma2 beta2.

And beta1 = v1/c, beta2 =v2/c.

Also, from the relativistic expression for momentum, p = gamma m v.

But since they move in opposite directions, their momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, so gamma1 m1 beta1 = gamma2 m2 beta2.

Ah, right, because p = gamma m v = gamma m beta c.

So, equation (2) is gamma1 m1 beta1 = gamma2 m2 beta2.

So, equation (2) can be written as gamma1 * beta1 = (gamma2 * beta2) * (m2/m1).

Because m2=2 m1, this becomes gamma1 beta1 = 2 gamma2 beta2.

Hmm.

Now, perhaps it's easier to express gamma1 in terms of gamma2, or vice versa.

From equation (2): gamma1 beta1 =2 gamma2 beta2.

But beta1= v1/c, beta2= v2/c.

We also know from equation (1) that 0.33 gamma1 +0.66 gamma2=1.

So, perhaps let me express gamma1 from equation (1):

0.33 gamma1 = 1 - 0.66 gamma2 → gamma1 = (1 - 0.66 gamma2)/0.33 → gamma1= (10 -6.6 gamma2)/3.3.

Wait, maybe I can substitute this into equation (2).

So,

gamma1 beta1 =2 gamma2 beta2.

But beta1 and beta2 are related through their velocities. Let me express beta1 in terms of beta2.

Wait, from the momentum equation, the velocities are related. Let me see.

But this is getting complicated. Perhaps I can assume that beta1 and beta2 are small, so that gamma is approximately 1 + (1/2) beta².

So, gamma ≈1 + (beta²)/2.

Then, equation (1) becomes:

0.33 (1 + (beta1^2)/2) +0.66 (1 + (beta2^2)/2 ) ≈1.

Expanding,

0.33 + 0.33 (beta1²/2) +0.66 + 0.66 (beta2²/2) ≈1.

Adding the constants: 0.33 +0.66=0.99.

So,

0.99 + (0.33 beta1² +0.66 beta2² )/2 ≈1.

Subtract 0.99,

(0.33 beta1^2 +0.66 beta2^2 )/2 ≈0.01.

Multiply both sides by 2,

0.33 beta1^2 +0.66 beta2^2 ≈0.02.

Hmm, but without more information, this might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps I can relate beta1 and beta2 via equation (2).

From equation (2) and the approximation gamma≈1 + (1/2) beta²,

gamma1 beta1 ≈ (1 + (beta1^2)/2) beta1 = beta1 + (beta1^3)/2.

Similarly, gamma2 beta2 ≈ beta2 + (beta2^3)/2.

But equation (2) says:

gamma1 beta1 =2 gamma2 beta2.

So,

beta1 + (beta1^3)/2 ≈ 2 [ beta2 + (beta2^3)/2 ].

But beta1 =2 v2, wait no, in the classical case, v1=2 v2, but in reality, it's v1 = (m2/(m1)) v2 = 2 v2.

Wait, but that's the classical relation. In reality, the velocities would be different because of relativistic effects.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to proceed numerically.

Let me make an assumption that beta2 is small, so beta2^3 is negligible.

So, equation (2) becomes:

gamma1 beta1 ≈ 2 gamma2 beta2.

But if beta2 is small, then gamma2≈1, so gamma1 beta1≈2 beta2.

But beta1 =2 beta2 (from classical velocity relation), so substituting:

gamma1 (2 beta2) ≈ 2 beta2 → gamma1 ≈1.

Which would imply that gamma1 is approximately 1, so beta1^2 is small. So, equation (1) becomes:

0.33 *1 +0.66 *1 ≈0.99, but equation (1) requires 0.33 gamma1 +0.66 gamma2=1.

So, 0.33*1 +0.66*1=0.99, which is less than 1. So, to make it equal to 1, the gammas must be slightly higher than 1.

So, perhaps the gammas are each about 1.005.

Wait, but earlier when I calculated with beta2=0.1, gamma was about 1.005, and equation (1) 0.33*1.005 + 0.66*1.005 →0.33*1.005=0.33165; 0.66*1.005=0.6633 → sum=0.995, which is still less than 1.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps beta2 is a bit larger. Let's try beta2=0.11.

Then, gamma2=1/sqrt(1 -0.11^2)=1/sqrt(1-0.0121)=1/sqrt(0.9879)=1.00605.

Equation (2): gamma1 beta1 =2 gamma2 beta2.

Assume beta1=2 beta2=0.22. Then,

gamma1 *0.22 =2 *1.00605 *0.11 → gamma1 *0.22= 0.22133.

So, gamma1=0.22133 / 0.22 ≈1.006.

So, gamma1 is about 1.006.

Now, equation (1):

0.33 *1.006 +0.66 *1.00605 →0.33*1.006=0.332, 0.66*1.00605=0.663993 → sum≈0.332 +0.663993≈0.996, which is still less than 1.

Hmm, need to get to 1. So, perhaps beta2 is a bit higher.

Let me try beta2=0.12.

gamma2=1/sqrt(1 -0.12^2)=1/sqrt(1-0.0144)=1/sqrt(0.9856)=1.0072.

beta1=2*0.12=0.24.

gamma1= (from equation (2)) gamma1 beta1=2 gamma2 beta2 → gamma1 *0.24=2 *1.0072 *0.12 → 2 *1.0072=2.0144; 2.0144 *0.12=0.241728 → so gamma1=0.241728/0.24=1.0072.

Now, equation (1): 0.33 *1.0072 +0.66 *1.0072 → 0.33 *1.0072≈0.33238, 0.66 *1.0072≈0.66475 → sum≈0.33238+0.66475≈0.99713, still less than 1.

Hmm, not enough. Let's try beta2=0.13.

gamma2=1/sqrt(1-0.0169)=1/sqrt(0.9831)=1.0085.

beta1=0.26.

Equation (2): gamma1 *0.26=2*1.0085 *0.13 →2*1.0085=2.017 →2.017*0.13≈0.2622 → gamma1=0.2622/0.26≈1.0085.

Equation (1): 0.33 *1.0085 +0.66 *1.0085 →0.33*1.0085≈0.3328, 0.66*1.0085≈0.6655. Sum≈0.3328+0.6655≈0.9983, still less than 1.

Hmm. Let's try beta2=0.14.

gamma2=1/sqrt(1-0.14^2)=1/sqrt(0.9796)=1.00525.

Wait no, wait: 0.14^2=0.0196 →1-0.0196=0.9804 → sqrt(0.9804)=0.9901 → 1/0.9901≈1.010.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated earlier steps. Let me compute gamma2 for beta=0.14.

gamma2=1/sqrt(1 -0.14^2)=1/sqrt(1-0.0196)=1/sqrt(0.9804)=1/(0.99015)=approx 1.0099.

beta1=2*0.14=0.28.

Equation (2): gamma1 *0.28=2 *1.0099 *0.14 → 2 *1.0099=2.0198 →2.0198 *0.14≈0.28277 → gamma1=0.28277/0.28≈1.0099.

Equation (1): 0.33 *1.0099 +0.66 *1.0099 → 1.0099*(0.33 +0.66)=1.0099*(0.99)=0.9998, which is just under 1.

Ah, very close. So, beta2≈0.14, gamma2≈1.010, gamma1≈1.010.

So, equation (1) gives 0.9998, which is almost 1.

So, the exact beta2 would be a little higher than 0.14 to make equation (1) equal to 1.

But for the sake of approximation, let's proceed with beta2=0.14, gamma2=1.010.

So, the velocities are beta2=0.14 → v2=0.14 c; v1=0.28 c.

Now, compute the relativistic kinetic energies.

For fragment 2 (mass m2=0.66 M):

T1_rel = (gamma2-1) m2 c².

gamma2=1.010 → gamma2-1=0.010.

m2 c²=0.66 *300 GeV=198 GeV.

So, T1_rel=0.010 *198=1.98 GeV, which is 1980 MeV.

Wait, that's way higher than the classical 1 GeV. That can't be right. Because earlier estimates with beta2=0.1 gave T1_rel≈1 GeV, but with beta2=0.14, T1_rel is 1.98 GeV. That would make the difference 980 MeV, which is way outside the options.

But that doesn't make sense because the sum of the kinetic energies would be K1 + K2.

Wait, another calculation mistake? Let's see.

Wait, if m2 is 0.66 M and M c²=300 GeV, then m2 c²=198 GeV.

So, T1_rel=(gamma2-1)*198 GeV.

If gamma2=1.010, then T1_rel=0.010 *198=1.98 GeV, which is 1980 MeV.

But in the classical approximation, T1_classical was 1 GeV (1000 MeV).

So, the difference would be 1980 -1000=980 MeV, which is way larger than the options. So, something is wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I missed a decimal point.

Wait, earlier when beta2=0.1, gamma2=1.00507, and T1_rel was about 1 GeV.

But when I tried beta2=0.14, the sum of the two gamma terms in equation (1) gave 0.9998, which is nearly 1. So, perhaps the correct beta2 is about 0.14 to 0.15.

Wait, but let's think: when the velocity is higher, the gamma factor increases, leading to higher KEs. But the sum of KEs must be 3 GeV.

Wait, perhaps the approach I took is flawed, and the velocities are much lower.

Alternative approach: Let me assume that the velocities are small, so that beta is small, and gamma ≈1 + (1/2) beta².

So,

gamma ≈1 + (beta²)/2.

So, KE= (gamma-1) m c² ≈ (beta²/2) m c².

So, for fragment 1, K1≈ (beta1²/2) m1 c².

Fragment 2: K2≈ (beta2²/2) m2 c².

Sum K1 + K2 =3 GeV.

From momentum conservation, m1 beta1 = m2 beta2 → beta2 = (m1/m2) beta1.

Since m2=2 m1, beta2= (1/2) beta1.

So, beta1=2 beta2.

So,

K1= ( (2 beta2)^2 )/2 * m1 c² = (4 beta2² / 2) m1 c^2= 2 beta2² m1 c².

K2= (beta2²/2) m2 c²= (beta2²/2) (2 m1) c²= beta2² m1 c².

So, K1 + K2=2 beta2² m1 c² + beta2² m1 c²=3 beta2² m1 c^2=3 GeV.

m1 c^2=0.33 *300 GeV=99 GeV.

So,

3 beta2² *99 GeV=3 GeV → beta2² *99= 1 → beta2²=1/99 → beta2=1/sqrt(99)=0.1005.

So, beta2=0.1005, beta1=0.201.

Now, compute the relativistic KEs.

K1= (gamma1-1) m1 c².

gamma1=1/sqrt(1 - beta1²)=1/sqrt(1 - (0.201)^2)=1/sqrt(1-0.040401)=1/sqrt(0.9596)=1.0208.

So, gamma1-1=0.0208.

So, K1=0.0208 *99 GeV ≈2.059 GeV.

Similarly, fragment 2:

beta2=0.1005.

gamma2=1/sqrt(1 - (0.1005)^2)=1/sqrt(1-0.0101)=1/sqrt(0.9899)=1.005025.

So, gamma2-1=0.005025.

K2=(0.005025) *198 GeV≈1.0 GeV.

So, K1≈2.059 GeV, K2≈1.0 GeV. Sum≈3.059 GeV, which is slightly more than 3 GeV, probably due to the approximation.

So, the correct KE for fragment 2 is approximately 1.0 GeV.

In the classical approximation, K2_classical=1 GeV.

Wait, but according to this, the relativistic K2 is 1 GeV (approx), and the classical is also 1 GeV. So, the difference would be negligible. But this can't be right because the options suggest a difference of 5 MeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of K2's relativistic KE.

Wait, K2_rel= (gamma2-1) m2 c².

gamma2=1.005025 → gamma2-1=0.005025.

m2 c^2=198 GeV.

So, K2_rel=0.005025 *198 =1.00495 GeV.

Which is about 1.005 GeV, or 1005 MeV.

In the classical approximation, K2_classical=1 GeV.

So, the difference is 1005 MeV -1000 MeV=5 MeV.

Ah! That's option B.

So, the correct T1 is 1005 MeV, and the classical value is 1000 MeV, so the difference is +5 MeV.

Wait, but the problem asks for the difference between the correct T1 and the classical T1. So, correct minus classical is +5 MeV.

The options are:

A) 2 MeV.

B)5 MeV.

C)10 MeV.

D)20 MeV.

So, the answer is option B, 5 MeV.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the fission process and calculate the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, both relativistically and classically, to find the difference between the two.

### Problem Setup
- The initial nucleus has a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV.
- After fission, the two fragments have rest masses such that one is twice as massive as the other, and their combined rest mass is 99% of the initial mass.
- The total rest mass after fission is \( 0.99 \times 300 = 297 \, \text{GeV} \), leaving a mass defect of \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \), which is converted into the total kinetic energy of the two fragments.

### Fragment Masses
- Let the lighter fragment have mass \( m \), and the heavier fragment have mass \( 2m \). Their combined rest mass is \( m + 2m = 3m = 0.99M \), so \( m = 0.33M \) and \( 2m = 0.66M \).
- The lighter fragment has rest energy \( m_1c^2 = 0.33 \times 300 = 99 \, \text{GeV} \), and the heavier fragment has rest energy \( m_2c^2 = 0.66 \times 300 = 198 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Conservation of Momentum
- Since the nucleus is initially at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. Thus, the momenta of the two fragments are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction:
  \[
  \gamma_1 m_1 v_1 = \gamma_2 m_2 v_2
  \]
  where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor.

### Kinetic Energy Relationship
- The total kinetic energy of the two fragments is \( K_1 + K_2 = 3 \, \text{GeV} \), where \( K_1 \) and \( K_2 \) are the kinetic energies of the lighter and heavier fragments, respectively. Using the relativistic kinetic energy formula \( K = (\gamma - 1)mc^2 \), we write:
  \[
  (\gamma_1 - 1)m_1c^2 + (\gamma_2 - 1)m_2c^2 = 3 \, \text{GeV}.
  \]

### Classical Approximation
- In the classical (non-relativistic) approximation, kinetic energy is \( K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \). From momentum conservation, \( m_1v_1 = m_2v_2 \), and since \( m_2 = 2m_1 \), we find \( v_1 = 2v_2 \).
- The classical kinetic energies are:
  \[
  K_{\text{class},1} = \frac{1}{2}m_1v_1^2 = 2m_1v_2^2, \quad K_{\text{class},2} = \frac{1}{2}m_2v_2^2 = m_1v_2^2.
  \]
  The total kinetic energy is:
  \[
  K_{\text{class},1} + K_{\text{class},2} = 3m_1v_2^2 = 3 \, \text{GeV}.
  \]
  Solving for \( m_1v_2^2 \), we find \( m_1v_2^2 = 1 \, \text{GeV} \). Substituting \( m_1 = 99 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \), we calculate \( v_2 \approx 0.1005c \).

- The classical kinetic energy of the heavier fragment is:
  \[
  K_{\text{class},2} = m_1v_2^2 = 1 \, \text{GeV} = 1000 \, \text{MeV}.
  \]

### Relativistic Calculation
- Using the relativistic kinetic energy formula \( K = (\gamma - 1)mc^2 \), we calculate the relativistic kinetic energy of the heavier fragment. From \( v_2 \approx 0.1005c \), we find:
  \[
  \gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_2^2/c^2}} \approx 1.005025, \quad \gamma_2 - 1 \approx 0.005025.
  \]
  The relativistic kinetic energy is:
  \[
  K_{\text{rel},2} = (\gamma_2 - 1)m_2c^2 = 0.005025 \times 198 \, \text{GeV} \approx 1.005 \, \text{GeV} = 1005 \, \text{MeV}.
  \]

### Difference Between Relativistic and Classical Kinetic Energies
- The difference between the relativistic and classical kinetic energies of the heavier fragment is:
  \[
  \Delta K = K_{\text{rel},2} - K_{\text{class},2} = 1005 \, \text{MeV} - 1000 \, \text{MeV} = 5 \, \text{MeV}.
  \]

### Final Answer
The difference between the correct relativistic kinetic energy and the classical approximation is **5 MeV**.
