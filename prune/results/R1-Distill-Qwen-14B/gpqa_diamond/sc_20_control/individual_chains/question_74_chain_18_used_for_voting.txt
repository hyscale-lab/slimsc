Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit confused, but let me try to think it through. I remember that radioactive decay is a random process, right? Each atom has a certain probability of decaying over time, and the key thing is that the decay of each atom is independent of the past.

The question says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So if I have a bunch of these atoms, after 100 minutes, 32% of them would have decayed on average. But wait, the problem is about a single atom. So we've got one particular atom that hasn't decayed yet after 50 minutes. Now, what's the probability it'll decay in the next 150 minutes?

Hmm, I think I remember something about the decay probability being based on the remaining time and the decay constant. Oh right, the decay follows an exponential law. The formula I recall is N(t) = N0 * e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant and t is time. But how does that relate to probability?

Wait, the probability that the atom hasn't decayed by time t is given by P(t) = e^(-λt). So the probability that it decays by time t is 1 - e^(-λt). Alternatively, the probability of decay in a certain time interval would depend on the decay constant.

So let's start by finding the decay constant λ. We're told that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, or 0.32. So:

0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)

Which means e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

-100λ = ln(0.68)

So λ = - ln(0.68) / 100

Let me calculate that. ln(0.68) is approximately ln(2/3) is about -0.4055, but wait, let me get a more accurate value. Let me think: ln(1)=0, ln(0.5)= -0.6931, ln(0.6)= approx -0.5108, ln(0.68) is between those. Let me compute it. Alternatively, I can get it using a calculator, but since I can't, I'll estimate. Let's say ln(0.68) is approximately -0.385 (I think that's close because ln(0.7) is about -0.3567, so 0.68 is a bit less than 0.7, so maybe -0.385 is a reasonable approximation).

So λ ≈ 0.385 / 100 = 0.00385 per minute.

Wait, that's the decay constant. Now, the question is about the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes. But wait, we already have 50 minutes passed, and it hasn't decayed. So the remaining time from now is 150 minutes, but wait, no. The total time from the start is 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. So the decay probability up to 200 minutes minus the probability up to 50 minutes.

Wait, no—because it's the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed before 50 minutes. Because we're starting to monitor after 50 minutes, and the atom hasn't decayed yet.

So the conditional probability here is P( decay between 50 and 200 ) / P( hasn't decayed by 50 )

Wait, no. The question is, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. So the probability is P( decay between 50 and 200 | hasn't decayed by 50 )

But since radioactive decay is memoryless, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes, regardless of how much time has passed, depends only on the current time. So the remaining time is 150 minutes, so the probability is 1 - e^(-λ * 150 )

Wait, but wait, let me think again. Because the initial 50 minutes didn't cause a decay. So the atom is still there, so the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability it would have had if it started now. So no, the conditional probability doesn't affect the calculation because the decay process is memoryless. So the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is 1 - e^(-λ * 150 )

But wait, let's make sure. The initial information is that the decay probability in 100 minutes is 32%. So, 32% chance to decay in 100 minutes. So for the first 100 minutes, that's the given.

Now, we're at 50 minutes, and the atom hasn't decayed. So the question is, what's the chance it will decay in the next 150 minutes.

So the total time from now is 150 minutes, but the decay constant is the same. So the probability is 1 - e^(-λ * 150 )

But let me compute it.

First, find λ. From the initial condition:

0.32 = 1 - e^(-100λ )

So e^(-100λ ) = 0.68 → ln(0.68) = -100λ → λ = ( - ln(0.68) ) / 100

Compute ln(0.68). Let me think, ln(1)=0, ln(e^-0.385)= about 0.68? Wait, e^-0.4 is approximately 0.6703, which is close to 0.68. So ln(0.6703) ≈ -0.4. So 0.68 is a bit higher than 0.6703, so ln(0.68) is about -0.3856. So λ = 0.3856 / 100 ≈ 0.003856 per minute.

Now, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is P = 1 - e^(-λ * 150 )

Compute λ *150 = 0.003856 *150 = 0.5784

So e^(-0.5784) ≈ ? Let's compute that. Since e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, e^-0.6 is about 0.5488.

0.5784 is between 0.5 and 0.6. Let's see, 0.5784 is 0.0784 above 0.5. So between 0.5 and 0.6, e^-x decreases from 0.6065 to 0.5488. The difference is about 0.0577 over 0.1 change in x.

0.0784 is 78.4% of 0.1. So the decrease would be 0.0577 * 0.784 ≈ 0.0453. So e^-0.5784 ≈ 0.6065 - 0.0453 = 0.5612.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps a better approximation is to use the Taylor expansion for e^-x around x=0.6.

But wait, maybe I can calculate e^-0.5784 as follows: I know that e^-0.5 is approx 0.6065 and e^-0.6 is 0.5488. Let's compute the value at x=0.5784. So 0.5784 is 0.0784 above 0.5. The change in x is 0.0784, and the derivative of e^-x is -e^-x. So using a linear approximation:

e^-(0.5 + 0.0784) ≈ e^-0.5 * (1 - 0.0784) ≈ 0.6065 * (0.9216) ≈ 0.6065 * 0.92 ≈ 0.5572.

Wait, that's a bit off from my previous estimate. Maybe I should use a better method. Alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator approximation. But let's proceed.

So e^-0.5784 ≈ 0.56 (approximate). So 1 - 0.56 = 0.44. So 44% probability. So looking at the options, option A is 44%.

But wait, let me think again. Am I computing the right time frame here?

Wait, the initial 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. Now, we want the probability that it decays in the next 150. So from time t=50 to t=200, the time is 150 minutes. So the probability that it decays in this period, given that it hasn't decayed before 50 minutes.

But because decay is memoryless, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as for a new atom starting now. So I can compute 1 - e^(-λ * 150 ), which I estimated as 44%.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me check another approach. Since the probability of not decaying in 100 minutes is 0.68, then the probability of not decaying in t minutes is (0.68)^(t/100). Because the decay follows a Poisson process, and the probabilities multiply when time is scaled.

Wait, wait, no. Because the decay probability is 32% in 100 minutes. So the decay constant λ can also be written as λ = ln(2)/t_half, but perhaps another approach is to model this as P(t) = 1 - (1 - 0.32)^(t/100). Wait, no, that's not correct because the decay is exponential, not a fixed probability each time.

Wait, no. The correct approach is to model the decay as an exponential distribution. So the probability that the atom decays before time t is 1 - e^(-λ t). So from the initial condition, 1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32 → e^(-λ *100) = 0.68 → λ = - ln(0.68)/100 ≈ 0.003856 per minute, as before.

So for the next 150 minutes (from the point where 50 minutes have passed), the time is 150 minutes.

So the probability of decay is 1 - e^(-λ * 150 ) ≈ 1 - e^(- (0.003856 *150 )) = 1 - e^(-0.5784).

As I calculated earlier, e^-0.5784 ≈ 0.56 → 1 - 0.56 = 0.44, so 44%, option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute this more accurately. Let me try to get a better approximation for e^-0.5784.

We can know that:

e^-0.5 ≈ 0.6065

e^-0.6 ≈ 0.5488

The difference between x=0.5 and x=0.6 is 0.1, and the e^-x decreases by about 0.6065 - 0.5488 = 0.0577.

At x=0.5784, which is 0.0784 above 0.5, which is 78.4% of 0.1.

So the decrease from x=0.5 is 0.0577 * 0.784 ≈ 0.0577 * 0.784 → let's compute 0.05 *0.784 =0.0392, 0.0077 *0.784≈0.00603 → total ≈ 0.0452.

So e^-0.5784 ≈ 0.6065 - 0.0452 = 0.5613.

So 1 - 0.5613 = 0.4387, approximately 43.87%, which is about 44%, matching option A.

So the answer should be A) 44%.

Wait, but wait. Let me consider another approach. The initial statement is that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So P( decay within 100 ) = 0.32.

The general formula is P(t) = 1 - e^(-λ t )

So, 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100λ ) → e^(-100 λ ) = 0.68 → λ = (ln(0.68 )) / (-100 )

So, λ = (ln(1/1.47 )) → ln(1/1.47) = - ln(1.47 ) → ln(1.47 ) ≈ 0.3856 → so λ ≈ 0.003856 per minute.

Now, the time we're interested in is 150 minutes, so:

P = 1 - e^(-150 * 0.003856 ) → 150 * 0.003856 = 0.5784 → e^-0.5784 ≈ 0.56 → P = 0.44.

So that's 44%, so option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the way to calculate it is to compute the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed by 50.

So the probability is [1 - e^(-λ *200 ) ] - [1 - e^(-λ *50 ) ] = e^(-λ *50 ) - e^(-λ *200 )

But wait, that's another approach. Let's compute that.

Compute e^(-λ *50 ) and e^(-λ *200 )

λ=0.003856 per minute.

λ*50 = 0.1928 → e^-0.1928 ≈ 0.824.

λ*200=0.7712 → e^-0.7712 ≈ 0.462.

So the probability is 0.824 - 0.462 = 0.362 → 36.2%, which is about 36%. But that's not one of the options. So that suggests that this approach might not be correct.

Wait, but that would be the probability of decay between 50 and 200 minutes, but under the condition that the atom hasn't decayed before 50 minutes, it's (e^(-λ *50 ) - e^(-λ *200 )) / e^(-λ *50 ) = [e^(-λ *50 ) - e^(-λ *200 ) ] / e^(-λ *50 )

= 1 - e^(-λ (200 -50 )) → 1 - e^(-150 λ )

Which brings us back to the same 44% as before. So the correct approach is actually to compute 1 - e^(-150 λ ), which is 44%.

To solve the problem, we analyze the radioactive decay process, which follows an exponential law. The decay probability of an atom within a given time is described by the formula:

\[
P(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
\]

where \( \lambda \) is the decay constant and \( t \) is the time elapsed. The problem states that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, or 0.32. Using this information, we can calculate \( \lambda \):

\[
0.32 = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 100}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\lambda \cdot 100 = \ln(0.68)
\]

\[
\lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100}
\]

Using approximations, \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.3856 \), so:

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{0.3856}{100} \approx 0.003856 \, \text{per minute}.
\]

Next, we calculate the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes. Since radioactive decay is memoryless, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes depends only on the decay constant \( \lambda \) and the time elapsed (150 minutes). The probability is given by:

\[
P = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}
\]

Substituting \( \lambda = 0.003856 \) and \( t = 150 \):

\[
\lambda \cdot 150 = 0.003856 \cdot 150 \approx 0.5784
\]

\[
e^{-0.5784} \approx 0.56
\]

Thus:

\[
P = 1 - 0.56 = 0.44
\]

This corresponds to a 44% probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit confused, but let me try to think it through. I remember that radioactive decay is a random process, right?

Wait, the probability that the atom hasn't decayed by time t is given by P(t) = e^(-λt). So the probability that it decays by time t is 1 - e^(-λt). Alternatively, the probability of decay in a certain time interval would depend on the decay constant.

So let's start by finding the decay constant λ. We're told that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, or 0.32. So:

0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)

Which means e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

-100λ = ln(0.68)

So λ = - ln(0.68) / 100

Let me calculate that. ln(0.68) is approximately ln(2/3) is about -0.4055, but wait, let me get a more accurate value. Let me think: ln(1)=0, ln(0.5)= -0.6931, ln(0.6)= approx -0.5108, ln(0.68) is between those. Let me compute it. Alternatively, I can get it using a calculator, but since I can't, I'll estimate. Let's say ln(0.68) is approximately -0.385 (I think that's close because ln(0.7) is about -0.3567, so 0.68 is a bit less than 0.7, so maybe -0.385 is a reasonable approximation).

So λ ≈ 0.385 / 100 = 0.00385 per minute.

Wait, that's the decay constant. Now, the question is about the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes. But wait, we already have 50 minutes passed, and it hasn't decayed. So the remaining time from now is 150 minutes, but wait, no. The total time from the start is 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. So the decay probability up to 200 minutes minus the probability up to 50 minutes.

Wait, no—because it's the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed before 50 minutes. Because we're starting to monitor after 50 minutes, and the atom hasn't decayed yet.

So the conditional probability here is P( decay between 50 and 200 ) / P( hasn't decayed by 50 )

Wait, no. The question is, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. So the probability is P( decay between 50 and 200 | hasn't decayed by 50 )

But since radioactive decay is memoryless, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes, regardless of how much time has passed, depends only on the current time. So the remaining time is 150 minutes, so the probability is 1 - e^(-λ * 150 )

Wait, but wait, let me think again. Because the initial 50 minutes didn't cause a decay. So the atom is still there, so the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability it would have had if it started now. So no, the conditional probability doesn't affect the calculation because the decay process is memoryless. So the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is 1 - e^(-λ * 150 )

But wait, let's make sure. The initial information is that the decay probability in 100 minutes is 32%. So, 32% chance to decay in 100 minutes. So for the first 100 minutes, that's the given.

Now, we're at 50 minutes, and the atom hasn't decayed. So the question is, what's the chance it will decay in the next 150 minutes.

So the total time from now is 150 minutes, but the decay constant is the same. So the probability is 1 - e^(-λ * 150 )

But let me compute it.

First, find λ. From the initial condition:

0.32 = 1 - e^(-100λ )

So e^(-100λ ) = 0.68 → ln(0.68) = -100λ → λ = ( - ln(0.68) ) / 100

Compute ln(0.68). Let me think, ln(1)=0, ln(e^-0.385)= about 0.68? Wait, e^-0.4 is approximately 0.6703, which is close to 0.68. So ln(0.6703) ≈ -0.4. So 0.68 is a bit higher than 0.6703, so ln(0.68) is about -0.3856. So λ = 0.3856 / 100 ≈ 0.003856 per minute.

Now, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is P = 1 - e^(-λ * 150 )

Compute λ *150 = 0.003856 *150 = 0.5784

So e^(-0.5784) ≈ ? Let's compute that. Since e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, e^-0.6 is about 0.5488.

0.5784 is between 0.5 and 0.6. Let's see, 0.5784 is 0.0784 above 0.5. So between 0.5 and 0.6, e^-x decreases from 0.6065 to 0.5488. The difference is about 0.0577 over 0.1 change in x.

0.0784 is 78.4% of 0.1. So the decrease would be 0.0577 * 0.784 ≈ 0.0453. So e^-0.5784 ≈ 0.6065 - 0.0453 = 0.5612.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps a better approximation is to use the Taylor expansion for e^-x around x=0.6.

But wait, maybe I can calculate e^-0.5784 as follows: I know that e^-0.5 is approx 0.6065 and e^-0.6 is 0.5488. Let's compute the value at x=0.5784. So 0.5784 is 0.0784 above 0.5. The change in x is 0.0784, and the derivative of e^-x is -e^-x. So using a linear approximation:

e^-(0.5 + 0.0784) ≈ e^-0.5 * (1 - 0.0784) ≈ 0.6065 * (0.9216) ≈ 0.6065 * 0.92 ≈ 0.5572.

Wait, that's a bit off from my previous estimate. Maybe I should use a better method. Alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator approximation. But let's proceed.

So e^-0.5784 ≈ 0.56 (approximate). So 1 - 0.56 = 0.44. So 44% probability. So looking at the options, option A is 44%.

But wait, let me think again. Am I computing the right time frame here?

Wait, the initial 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. Now, we want the probability that it decays in the next 150. So from time t=50 to t=200, the time is 150 minutes. So the probability that it decays in this period, given that it hasn't decayed before 50 minutes.

But because decay is memoryless, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as for a new atom starting now. So I can compute 1 - e^(-λ * 150 ), which I estimated as 44%.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me check another approach. Since the probability of not decaying in 100 minutes is 0.68, then the probability of not decaying in t minutes is (0.68)^(t/100). Because the decay follows a Poisson process, and the probabilities multiply when time is scaled.

Wait, wait, no. Because the decay probability is 32% in 100 minutes. So the decay constant λ can also be written as λ = ln(2)/t_half, but perhaps another approach is to model this as P(t) = 1 - (1 - 0.32)^(t/100). Wait, no, that's not correct because the decay is exponential, not a fixed probability each time.

Wait, no. The correct approach is to model the decay as an exponential distribution. So the probability that the atom decays before time t is 1 - e^(-λ t). So from the initial condition, 1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32 → e^(-λ *100) = 0.68 → λ = - ln(0.68)/100 ≈ 0.003856 per minute, as before.

So for the next 150 minutes (from the point where 50 minutes have passed), the time is 150 minutes.

So the probability of decay is 1 - e^(-λ * 150 ) ≈ 1 - e^(- (0.003856 *150 )) = 1 - e^(-0.5784).

As I calculated earlier, e^-0.5784 ≈ 0.56 → 1 - 0.56 = 0.44, so 44%, option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute this more accurately. Let me try to get a better approximation for e^-0.5784.

We can know that:

e^-0.5 ≈ 0.6065

e^-0.6 ≈ 0.5488

The difference between x=0.5 and x=0.6 is 0.1, and the e^-x decreases by about 0.6065 - 0.5488 = 0.0577.

At x=0.5784, which is 0.0784 above 0.5, which is 78.4% of 0.1.

So the decrease from x=0.5 is 0.0577 * 0.784 ≈ 0.0577 * 0.784 → let's compute 0.05 *0.784 =0.0392, 0.0077 *0.784≈0.00603 → total ≈ 0.0452.

So e^-0.5784 ≈ 0.6065 - 0.0452 = 0.5613.

So 1 - 0.5613 = 0.4387, approximately 43.87%, which is about 44%, matching option A.

So the answer should be A) 44%.

Wait, but wait. Let me consider another approach. The initial statement is that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So P( decay within 100 ) = 0.32.

The general formula is P(t) = 1 - e^(-λ t )

So, 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100λ ) → e^(-100 λ ) = 0.68 → λ = (ln(0.68 )) / (-100 )

So, λ = (ln(1/1.47 )) → ln(1/1.47) = - ln(1.47 ) → ln(1.47 ) ≈ 0.3856 → so λ ≈ 0.003856 per minute.

Now, the time we're interested in is 150 minutes, so:

P = 1 - e^(-150 * 0.003856 ) → 150 * 0.003856 = 0.5784 → e^-0.5784 ≈ 0.56 → P = 0.44.

So that's 44%, so option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the way to calculate it is to compute the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed by 50.

So the probability is [1 - e^(-λ *200 ) ] - [1 - e^(-λ *50 ) ] = e^(-λ *50 ) - e^(-λ *200 )

But wait, that's another approach. Let's compute that.

Compute e^(-λ *50 ) and e^(-λ *200 )

λ=0.003856 per minute.

λ*50 = 0.1928 → e^-0.1928 ≈ 0.824.

λ*200=0.7712 → e^-0.7712 ≈ 0.462.

So the probability is 0.824 - 0.462 = 0.362 → 36.2%, which is about 36%. But that's not one of the options. So that suggests that this approach might not be correct.

Wait, but that would be the probability of decay between 50 and 200 minutes, but under the condition that the atom hasn't decayed before 50 minutes, it's (e^(-λ *50 ) - e^(-λ *200 )) / e^(-λ *50 ) = [e^(-λ *50 ) - e^(-λ *200 ) ] / e^(-λ *50 )

= 1 - e^(-λ (200 -50 )) → 1 - e^(-150 λ )

Which brings us back to the same 44% as before. So the correct approach is actually to compute 1 - e^(-150 λ ), which is 44%.


To solve the problem, we analyze the radioactive decay process, which follows an exponential law. The decay probability of an atom within a given time is described by the formula:

\[
P(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
\]

where \( \lambda \) is the decay constant and \( t \) is the time elapsed. The problem states that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, or 0.32. Using this information, we can calculate \( \lambda \):

\[
0.32 = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 100}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\lambda \cdot 100 = \ln(0.68)
\]

\[
\lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100}
\]

Using approximations, \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.3856 \), so:

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{0.3856}{100} \approx 0.003856 \, \text{per minute}.
\]

Next, we calculate the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes. Since radioactive decay is memoryless, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes depends only on the decay constant \( \lambda \) and the time elapsed (150 minutes). The probability is given by:

\[
P = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}
\]

Substituting \( \lambda = 0.003856 \) and \( t = 150 \):

\[
\lambda \cdot 150 = 0.003856 \cdot 150 \approx 0.5784
\]

\[
e^{-0.5784} \approx 0.56
\]

Thus:

\[
P = 1 - 0.56 = 0.44
\]

This corresponds to a 44% probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. Therefore, the correct answer is:
