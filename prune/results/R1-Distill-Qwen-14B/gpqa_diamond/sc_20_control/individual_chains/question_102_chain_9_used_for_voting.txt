Okay, let's try to figure out this question. I'm a bit new to this, so bear with me. So the question is about a genetic construct and why a certain fluorescent marker isn't showing up. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the setup: They've created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two genes in one construct. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So each is part of a separate ORF, right?

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. CBA is a strong promoter, I think, maybe constitutive. The receptor is after an IRES element. IRES is an internal ribosome entry site, which allows for the translation of a second ORF from the same mRNA. So the mRNA would have two coding regions: one for the ligand (mCherry) and another for the receptor (eGFP), thanks to the IRES.

Now, the stops: between ligand and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. And between receptor and eGFP, a lox2272-stop-lox2272. So these are stop cassettes that prevent expression unless Cre is present to excise them.

Wait, loxP and lox2272 are recognition sites for Cre. LoxP is a 34 bp site, and lox2272 is a variant, longer I think. Cre can recombine these sites. So in the vector, when Cre is not present, the stop cassettes block the expression of mCherry and eGFP.

When Cre is introduced, it should excise the stop cassettes, allowing the genes to be expressed. Because, for example, in the ligand's case, the stop cassette would be between the ligand and mCherry. So the ligand would be expressed as a fusion with mCherry? Or are they separate? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the ligand ORF is fused to mCherry. So the ligand is part of a larger ORF that includes mCherry? Or are they separate? Or is it ligand-mCherry as a fusion? Because the way it's written is "ligand ORF at the 5' position, fused to mCherry." So the ligand is followed by mCherry, but the stop cassette is in between. So without Cre, the ligand is expressed but the mCherry is not. Or maybe the other way around.

Wait, no. Wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter. Then, after the ligand ORF, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, then mCherry. So, the mRNA would have the ligand sequence, then the stop cassette, then mCherry. So without Cre, the stop cassette would prevent mCherry from being expressed. But the ligand is expressed because the CBA promoter is upstream.

Similarly, for the receptor, the IRES is upstream. So the receptor ORF is there, followed by the lox2272-stop-lox2272, then eGFP. So the eGFP won't be expressed unless Cre removes the stop.

Wait, but the vector is a bicistronic construct. So both ligand and receptor are on the same vector, each with their own expression elements.

The experiment: They transfected primary astrocyte cultures with this plasmid and used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. After that, in the Western blot, using total proteins, actin loading is proportional. So the blot is properly done.

Then, they breed a mouse model homozygous for the construct in the wt background. Then they cross it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. So the Cre is under the SOX10 promoter, I guess, which would express Cre in neural crest derivatives, like in the neural crest cells.

After the offspring are born, they visualize them under a confocal microscope. They expected to see green (from eGFP) but didn't. The question is why.

The options are A to D.

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But in this case, the construct is for the same cells, not sure. Not sure if this affects eGFP expression.

Option B: the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. So it's not trafficked to the cell surface. But why would that happen? Maybe the eGFP is not correctly processed. But how would that relate to the Cre expression?

Option C: the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. Well, the vector uses the CBA promoter for the ligand, which is strong. The receptor is under IRES, which is constitutive. So perhaps the construct doesn't have the right regulatory elements, but if the vector was properly made, maybe not. But in the question, the vector is correctly made, so maybe this is not the issue.

Option D: the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame. Oh, that's about whether the stop cassette is in frame when Cre is not present. So without Cre, the stop cassette is between the receptor and eGFP. If the stop is in frame, then the receptor is expressed as a fusion with eGFP? No, wait, no. Wait, the stop cassette is a transcriptional stop in between. So, without Cre, the eGFP is not expressed. But when Cre is present, it deletes the stop, allowing eGFP to be expressed.

Wait, but for the construct to work, when Cre is present, the stop cassettes are removed, allowing the expression of both mCherry (after ligand) and eGFP (after receptor). So in the mouse model, when the Cre is active, the eGFP should be expressed.

Wait, but the mice were crossed to SOX10-Cre. So in the offspring, the Cre is expressed in neural crest-derived cells. So in those cells, the construct should have been activated, and eGFP should be expressed.

But the result is that they don't see the green signal. So why is eGFP not being expressed?

Possible issues: The Cre isn't active, or the construct isn't getting into the right cells, or the eGFP isn't being expressed for another reason.

But according to the construct, in the presence of Cre (from SOX10-Cre), the loxP and lox2272 sites would recombine, removing the stop cassettes. So the ligand would be expressed with mCherry, and the receptor with eGFP.

But perhaps the problem is with the expression of Cre itself. If the Cre isn't active, then the stop cassettes remain, so the eGFP wouldn't be expressed.

Wait, but they crossed the homozygous construct mice (both alleles) to SOX10-Cre. So each offspring should have two copies of the construct (homozygous) and one copy of SOX10-Cre (hemizygous). So Cre should be active in the neural crest cells. So why isn't eGFP expressed?

Alternatively, perhaps the stop cassette isn't being correctly excised.

Wait, the ligand and receptor have different stop cassettes. The ligand side has loxP, and the receptor has lox2272. Wait, but the loxP and lox2272 are different. Wait, the loxP site is a 34 bp sequence, while lox2272 is a longer site (I think 33 bp, but perhaps it's a different arrangement). Cre can only recombine a loxP site with another loxP site, or with a compatible site. Lox2272 is a variant that can be used for recombination, but can Cre recombine loxP and lox2272 together?

Hmm, I might be getting this wrong. If the vector has a loxP site on the ligand side and a lox2272 on the receptor side, then when Cre is introduced, would the two sites recombine? Or would Cre only recombine the same site types?

Wait, the lox2272 is a loxP variant. If the two sites are loxP and lox2272, I think Cre cannot recombine them because Cre requires specific sequences. So if the two sites are different, Cre can't mediate recombination between them.

In the construct, the ligand has a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and the receptor has a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. So for each stop cassette, the same sites are used. So for the ligand's stop, the loxP sites flank the stop, and similarly for the receptor, the lox2272 sites flank the stop.

Wait, no. The ligand region is loxP-stop-loxP, so when Cre is present, it would excise the stop, allowing the mCherry to be expressed after the ligand.

The receptor region is lox2272-stop-lox2272. So Cre would excise the stop, allowing the eGFP to be expressed after the receptor.

But perhaps in the vector, it's designed so that a single Cre would recombine both. Wait, but if the ligand and receptor are on the same vector, and each has their own stop cassette, each flanked by their own lox sites, then each would need Cre to recombine their respective sites.

But perhaps the problem is that the loxP and lox2272 are different, and Cre can't recombine between different lox sites. So the ligand's stop can't be excised, but the receptor's stop can.

Wait, no, each stop cassette is flanked by same lox sites. So the ligand's stop is between two loxP sites, and the receptor's stop is between two lox2272 sites. So in that case, when Cre is present, it would excise each stop cassette on their respective sites. So the ligand and mCherry would be expressed, and the receptor and eGFP would be expressed.

But the question is that the eGFP isn't showing up. So perhaps the issue is elsewhere.

Wait, the vector is a bicistronic construct. So the same transcript is made for both ligand and receptor. The first ORF is the ligand, under CBA, then IRES, then the receptor. Or is it that the ligand is under CBA, and the receptor is under IRES?

Wait, the vector is described as a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. The ligand is at 5', under CBA, and the receptor is downstream, with IRES upstream. So the structure is: CBA promoter -> ligand ORF -> loxP-stop-loxP cassette -> mCherry ORF; then IRES -> receptor ORF -> lox2272-stop-lox2272 -> eGFP.

Wait, no, maybe the vector has two ORFs in a single transcript. So the first ORF is ligand under CBA, then after that, a stop cassette (loxP) for mCherry. Then, after IRES, the receptor ORF followed by a stop cassette (lox2272) for eGFP.

So when Cre is present, the stop cassettes are removed, allowing mCherry and eGFP to be expressed.

But the problem is that when they cross the mice with SOX10-Cre, they don't see eGFP. So perhaps the eGFP isn't being expressed.

Looking at the options again:

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Wait, when the stop cassette is removed, the receptor ORF is followed by eGFP. If they're not in frame, perhaps the eGFP isn't expressed correctly. Or, the stop cassette could cause a frameshift, but when Cre excises it, the reading frame would be correct.

Wait, the stop cassette is a transcriptional stop, not a translational stop. So in the absence of Cre, the mRNAs for ligand and receptor would include the stop cassette. So for the ligand, the mRNA would have the ligand sequence followed by the stop cassette, then mCherry. But without Cre, the stop is in between, so the ribosome would terminate, and mCherry wouldn't be expressed. Similarly, the receptor's mRNA would have the receptor sequence, then the stop, then eGFP. Without Cre, no eGFP.

But when Cre is expressed, it would excise the stop cassettes, allowing the mCherry and eGFP to be expressed.

But in the question, the mouse model doesn't show eGFP. So why?

Wait, maybe the Cre isn't active in the cells where the construct is expressed. But in this case, the Cre is under SOX10, which is active in neural crest cells. So if the construct is in neural crest cells, Cre is active, and the stop cassettes are excised.

But what if the construct isn't in the neural crest cells? Hmm, but the construct is in the mouse, and the Cre is only in neural crest. So if the construct is expressed elsewhere, but Cre isn't active there, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed, and the ligand would either be expressed or not.

Alternatively, perhaps the construct isn't getting into the right cells. But the question says that the expression was tested in primary astrocytes, which are not neural crest-derived, so perhaps the Cre isn't active in that case. But that's about the Western blot, not the mice.

Wait, the Western blot was done after transfecting primary astrocyte cultures. So in that case, without Cre, the stop cassettes are in place, so no mCherry or eGFP would be expressed. But in the Western blot, they're using antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So perhaps only the ligand and receptor would be expressed, but not the fluorescent proteins. So the Western blot may not show mCherry or eGFP because they're not expressed, but the ligand and receptor themselves would be. But the question says that the Western blot is using total proteins with actin loading. So the blot shows that ligand and receptor are expressed.

But the key is in the mouse. So when they cross to SOX10-Cre, the Cre should activate the construct in the neural crest-derived cells.

But the problem is that no green signal is observed. So perhaps the eGFP is not being produced.

Wait, another possibility: the IRES element isn't working properly. IRES allows for internal initiation of translation, so that the receptor and eGFP can be expressed from the same transcript as the ligand. But if the IRES is not functional, then the receptor won't be expressed.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not being correctly expressed because of a frameshift.

Wait, another thought: the loxP and lox2272 are different. So when Cre is introduced, it can't recombine between the two different sites. So the stop cassette for the receptor is flanked by lox2272, and Cre can't recombine that if the lox sites are different.

Wait, I thought that Cre can't recognize lox2272 unless it's the same as another lox2272. So if the ligand's stop is flanked by loxP and the receptor's stop by lox2272, then the Cre can only recombine each respective stop cassette, but perhaps the recombination doesn't occur because the two lox sites are different.

Wait, no, each stop cassette is flanked by the same types. The ligand's stop is between loxP, and the receptor's stop is between lox2272. So each site would be recombined independently. So when Cre is present in the cell, the ligand's stop (loxP) is excised, and the receptor's stop (lox2272) is also excised, allowing both mCherry and eGFP to be expressed.

But wait, in reality, Cre recombinase recognizes loxP sites. Lox2272 is a lox variant, but I'm not sure if Cre can recombine them. I think lox2272 is a site that is recognized by Cre, but it's a different sequence. So if a Cre is present, it can only recombine loxP sites with other loxP sites, and lox2272 sites with other lox2272 sites. So perhaps the lox2272 sites don't get recombined because the Cre can't recognize them. So in this case, the ligand's stop is between loxP sites, which Cre can recombine, so mCherry would be expressed. But the receptor's stop is between lox2272, which Cre can't recognize, so the stop remains, preventing eGFP expression.

Ah, that would be a problem. So the ligand's stop is flanked by loxP, allowing Cre to remove it, so mCherry is expressed. But the receptor's stop is flanked by lox2272, which isn't recognized by Cre, so the stop remains, and eGFP isn't expressed.

That would explain why only mCherry is expressed (if the ligand is expressed), but not eGFP. But in the question, the result is that the eGFP isn't expressed. So the correct option would be that the stop for the receptor isn't being excised because the lox sites are not recognized by Cre.

But looking at the options, none directly state that. So the options are A to D.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Hmm, but if the stop isn't excised, eGFP isn't expressed at all, which is the case here. Alternatively, perhaps the frame is wrong, but that would lead to a truncated protein if in frame, but perhaps not complete eGFP expression.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the lox sites are the same for the ligand and receptor, but in this case, they are different. So perhaps the stop cassettes are not both being excised.

Wait, but the question is about why eGFP isn't expressed. So if the stop between receptor and eGFP isn't being removed, then eGFP isn't expressed.

If the lox2272 sites aren't recognized by the Cre, then the stop remains, and eGFP isn't expressed. So the problem is that the Cre can't recombine the lox2272 sites.

But looking at the options, none of them directly address the lox site issue. So perhaps I'm missing another angle.

Wait, another possibility: The vector is a bicistronic construct, so the two ORFs are on the same mRNA. The ligand is first, then after IRES, the receptor. So for the eGFP to be expressed, the mRNA must be properly processed, and the IRES must function. If the IRES isn't functional, the receptor won't be translated.

But the question states that the vector was designed with the IRES upstream of the receptor. So perhaps the IRES is working, but if the stop cassette isn't removed, the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but in the presence of Cre, the stop cassette is removed. So if the eGFP isn't expressed, the stop must not have been removed. Which would happen if the lox2272 sites aren't recognized by Cre.

So perhaps the issue is that the Cre can't recognize the lox2272 sites. Therefore, the stop between receptor and eGFP remains, preventing its expression. So the eGFP isn't expressed.

But looking back at the options, none of them directly mention this. So perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the lox2272 wasn't removed, then the receptor would be expressed but eGFP not. Alternatively, if the stop remains, the eGFP isn't expressed.

But another possibility: In the vector, the eGFP is fused to the receptor, but in the same reading frame. If the stop cassette has a stop codon in between, perhaps the frame is shifted. But when the stop is removed, if the reading frame is correct, eGFP should be expressed.

Wait, no, the stop is a transcriptional stop, not a stop codon. So the mRNA would have the receptor sequence, then a stop (which is a transcriptional stop, so the rest isn't translated). So when Cre removes the stop, the mRNA continues beyond the receptor, allowing eGFP to be translated.

So the question is, why isn't eGFP expressed.

Another angle: The vector uses IRES for the receptor. If the IRES doesn't function, the receptor won't be translated. But the ligand would be translated under CBA.

But the problem is that the eGFP isn't expressed, so perhaps the IRES isn't working, but the question is about the construct.

Wait, the problem could be with the IRES element. If the IRES isn't functional, the receptor and eGFP won't be expressed even if the stop is removed.

But in this case, the presence of the IRES would allow the receptor to be expressed. So if the IRES isn't working, then the receptor wouldn't be expressed either. But in the question, the ligand is expressed, but the eGFP isn't. So perhaps the IRES is working.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the expression of the Cre isn't happening. But the mice were crossed with SOX10-Cre, which should express Cre in the neural crest cells.

Wait, another thought: The vector is a bicistronic construct, meaning both ligand and receptor are expressed in the same cell. But if the ligand and receptor are on the same construct, and if the ligand is secreted, then it could act on neighboring cells. But the question is about why the eGFP isn't expressed.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector isn't properly inserted into the genome, but the question states that the mouse is homozygous for the construct, so it's probably integrated correctly.

Wait, the SOX10-Cre is hemizygous. So the Cre is expressed in the neural crest cells. So in those cells, the Cre would excise the stop cassettes.

But maybe the lox2272 isn't the same as loxP, so Cre can't recombine it. Therefore, the stop cassette remains, and the eGFP isn't expressed. So the problem is that the lox sites are different.

But the options don't have this as an option. So perhaps the correct answer is D, the receptor and eGFP are not in frame.

Wait, another possibility. The ligand is under CBA, which is a strong constitutive promoter, while the receptor is under IRES, which allows for translation after the ligand. So when the stop is removed, the eGFP is expressed as part of the same mRNA.

But if the lox2272 isn't recombined, the stop remains. So the eGFP is not expressed.

So the problem is the lox2272 isn't recognized by Cre. So the stop isn't excised, eGFP not expressed.

But the options don't talk about lox sites. So perhaps the answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame.

Wait, but the stop is a transcriptional stop. So when the stop is removed, the mRNA continues beyond the receptor to eGFP. So the frame is correct because the stop was removed.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the eGFP is expressed, but not correctly trafficked. Option B says the receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. If the eGFP isn't correctly trafficked, it won't fluoresce. But that's a trafficking issue, not an expression issue. The question is about why the expression isn't happening.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is expressed, but the antibody isn't detecting it.

Wait, but in the question, the visualization is under confocal, using presumably GFP-specific filters. If the eGFP isn't expressed, no signal.

But why wouldn't it be expressed. Let's think again.

The vector has two stop cassettes. If the lox2272 sites aren't being recombined, then the stop remains, so eGFP isn't expressed.

But the question is in the context of the mouse. Suppose the vector's lox sites are loxP and lox2272. Cre can't recombine lox2272, so the stop remains, so eGFP isn't expressed.

But in the options, this isn't directly addressed. So perhaps the issue is with the frame.

Wait, if the stop is between the receptor and eGFP, and it's a transcriptional stop, then when Cre removes the stop, the mRNA continues, and the eGFP is expressed as a separate ORF. So the frame after the stop is correct.

So perhaps the issue is not with the frame. Then why isn't eGFP expressed.

Another angle: The vector's bicistronic construct requires both ORFs to be in the same reading frame. But the stop cassettes could affect this.

Wait, the ligand ORF is at 5', then the stop, then mCherry. The receptor ORF is after IRES, then stop, then eGFP. So perhaps when the stop is removed, the eGFP is in frame with the receptor.

But if the stop's removal doesn't correctly place the eGFP in frame with the receptor, then the eGFP won't be expressed.

Wait, but the eGFP is a separate ORF. So perhaps the frame isn't an issue.

Wait, maybe the vector was designed wrong. For example, the eGFP is in a different frame, so when the stop is removed, it's not correctly translated. But usually, the IRES would allow for separate translation.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's review the options again.

Option D: the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame. So when the stop is removed, the receptor's ORF continues into the eGFP, but if they're not in frame, the eGFP isn't expressed correctly. Or perhaps the eGFP is not expressed at all because it's not in the same reading frame as the receptor.

Wait, but the eGFP is after the stop. So when the stop is removed, the mRNA's reading frame for eGFP starts from the beginning of the eGFP ORF. So if the stop is correctly removed, the frame should be correct. So unless there's a frameshift in the stop cassette.

Wait, the stop cassette is a transcriptional stop, so the mRNA would have the receptor sequence, then a stop (which is a few nucleotides, perhaps a polyA signal or something), and then the eGFP sequence. So removing the stop would allow the eGFP to be expressed as its own ORF, in its own frame.

So perhaps the frames are correct, so option D isn't the issue.

Another possibility is that the eGFP isn't being properly expressed because the IRES isn't working. So the receptor is expressed, but the eGFP isn't. But that would mean the ligand is expressed, the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't. But without knowing about the IRES, that's hard to say.

Wait, looking back, the vector has the ligand under CBA, and the receptor under IRES. So the ligand's expression is driven by CBA, and the receptor's by IRES. So if the IRES isn't functional, the receptor isn't expressed, and eGFP isn't either. But in that case, both wouldn't be expressed.

But the question is about eGFP not being expressed, so perhaps the IRES is fine, and the ligand is expressed, but the eGFP isn't.

Hmm, perhaps the issue is with the stop cassettes. Let me think about the design again. For the ligand, the ORF is followed by a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, then mCherry. So without Cre, the ligand is expressed, but mCherry isn't. With Cre, the stop is removed, and mCherry is expressed.

Similarly, the receptor ORF is followed by a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette, then eGFP. Without Cre, the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't. With Cre, the stop is removed, and eGFP is expressed.

But if the Cre can't recombine the lox2272 sites, the stop remains, and eGFP isn't expressed.

But none of the options mention lox2272 not being recognized. So perhaps the correct answer is D, that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame.

Wait, but in that case, if they're not in frame, the eGFP would not be translated properly, but perhaps a truncated protein would be made, but that's not what's happening here. The question is that no eGFP is detected.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the IRES is after the receptor, so when the stop is removed, the eGFP is expressed as a separate ORF. But if the frame is wrong, the eGFP isn't translated correctly.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of the possible answers again.

Option A: ligand and receptor in a paracrine relationship. That means they act on different cells. But the construct is in the same cell, so they should be autocrine. But how does that affect eGFP expression? Maybe the ligand is secreted and acts on other cells, but the GFP is expressed in the same cell, so probably not the issue.

Option B: receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. If eGFP is a secreted protein or membrane-bound, it might not traffic correctly. But eGFP is a fluorescent marker, so it's probably cytoplasmic or nuclear. If it's stuck in Golgi, it wouldn't fluoresce, but the expression level would be low. But the question is about expression, not localization.

Option C: enhancer missing. The CBA promoter is constitutive, so missing enhancer wouldn't be the issue.

Option D: receptor and eGFP not in frame. So when the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, perhaps the frame is correct, but the problem is that the stop is in the way. So in the absence of Cre, the eGFP isn't expressed. But when Cre is present, the stop is removed, and eGFP is expressed.

But in this case, the Cre isn't removing the stop, so eGFP isn't expressed. So perhaps the issue is that the lox sites aren't recognized, making option D not the problem.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck, but based on the options, the most likely is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, leading to no eGFP expression. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the problem is that the Cre can't recombine the lox2272 sites, so the stop remains, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, another thought: the eGFP is fused to the receptor. So perhaps the eGFP is part of the same ORF as the receptor, but in that case, the stop would have to be removed to allow expression. But the way the question is structured, eGFP is at the C-terminus of the receptor. So the construct is receptor-eGFP.

But if the stop is not removed, then the eGFP isn't expressed. So why isn't the stop removed? Because the lox2272 sites aren't being recombined.

So perhaps the answer is none of the options, but since it's a multiple-choice question, the closest is D.

Wait, but the problem is with the stop cassette not being removed. So maybe the issue is that the lox sites are different, but the options don't include that. Therefore, the correct answer must be another option.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES is placed in a way that doesn't allow proper expression. But without knowing the design specifics, it's hard to say.

Wait, another angle: the IRES is after the receptor ORF. So the receptor is expressed, but the eGFP is under the IRES. So the eGFP would be expressed as a separate ORF. If the stop is removed, the eGFP should be expressed. But if the stop isn't removed, it's not expressed.

So the problem is that the stop isn't removed. Which would be due to the lox sites not being compatible with Cre.

But since none of the options address this, perhaps the intended answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Because when the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't in the correct frame, so it isn't expressed.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the lox sites are different, and the stop isn't excised, leading to no eGFP expression. But since this isn't an option, perhaps I should reevaluate.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector wasn't properly designed, and the eGFP is not under the correct promoter. Hmm, but the question says the ligand is under CBA, and the receptor is after IRES.

Wait, the absence of a promoter for the receptor's expression isn't the case because IRES allows for translation.

Hmm. I think I've thought through this as much as I can. Based on the options, the most likely answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. So when the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't translated correctly, so no fluorescence.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector designed to express a ligand and receptor pair in neural crest cells. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, followed by a loxP-stop-loxP cassette and mCherry, while the receptor is under an IRES element, followed by a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette and eGFP. The vector was introduced into mice homozygous for the construct, which were crossed with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. Despite this, no green fluorescence from eGFP was observed under confocal microscopy. The task is to determine the most likely reason for this outcome.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   This option suggests that the ligand acts on neighboring cells, while the receptor is expressed elsewhere. However, the construct is designed for co-expression in the same cell, and the absence of eGFP fluorescence is due to a failure in expression, not paracrine signaling. This does not explain the observed result.

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If eGFP were stuck in the Golgi, it would likely result in improper trafficking and localization rather than a complete absence of expression. The question specifically asks why eGFP is not expressed, making this option unlikely.

3. **Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The ligand is under the strong constitutive CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES element, which allows for translation. There is no indication that an enhancer is missing or required for the expression of these elements. This does not explain the lack of eGFP expression.

4. **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame**  
   The stop cassettes (loxP for the ligand and lox2272 for the receptor) are designed to block expression in the absence of Cre. When Cre is present, these cassettes are excised, allowing mCherry and eGFP to be expressed. However, if the receptor and eGFP are not in the correct reading frame after the stop cassette is removed, eGFP would not be properly translated. This could explain the absence of fluorescence. While the issue might also be related to the compatibility of the lox2272 sites with Cre (which is not explicitly addressed in the options), this explanation aligns most closely with the provided choices.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation for the absence of eGFP fluorescence is that the receptor and eGFP are not in the correct reading frame, preventing proper translation of eGFP.

**Answer: D**

Okay, let's try to figure out this question. I'm a bit new to this, so bear with me. So the question is about a genetic construct and why a certain fluorescent marker isn't showing up. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the setup: They've created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two genes in one construct. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So each is part of a separate ORF, right?

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. CBA is a strong promoter, I think, maybe constitutive. The receptor is after an IRES element. IRES is an internal ribosome entry site, which allows for the translation of a second ORF from the same mRNA. So the mRNA would have two coding regions: one for the ligand (mCherry) and another for the receptor (eGFP), thanks to the IRES.

Now, the stops: between ligand and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. And between receptor and eGFP, a lox2272-stop-lox2272. So these are stop cassettes that prevent expression unless Cre is present to excise them.

Wait, loxP and lox2272 are recognition sites for Cre. LoxP is a 34 bp site, and lox2272 is a variant, longer I think. Cre can recombine these sites. So in the vector, when Cre is not present, the stop cassettes block the expression of mCherry and eGFP.

When Cre is introduced, it should excise the stop cassettes, allowing the genes to be expressed. Because, for example, in the ligand's case, the stop cassette would be between the ligand and mCherry. So the ligand would be expressed as a fusion with mCherry? Or are they separate? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the ligand ORF is fused to mCherry. So the ligand is part of a larger ORF that includes mCherry? Or are they separate? Or is it ligand-mCherry as a fusion? Because the way it's written is "ligand ORF at the 5' position, fused to mCherry." So the ligand is followed by mCherry, but the stop cassette is in between. So without Cre, the ligand is expressed but the mCherry is not. Or maybe the other way around.

Wait, no. Wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter. Then, after the ligand ORF, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, then mCherry. So, the mRNA would have the ligand sequence, then the stop cassette, then mCherry. So without Cre, the stop cassette would prevent mCherry from being expressed. But the ligand is expressed because the CBA promoter is upstream.

Similarly, for the receptor, the IRES is upstream. So the receptor ORF is there, followed by the lox2272-stop-lox2272, then eGFP. So the eGFP won't be expressed unless Cre removes the stop.

Wait, but the vector is a bicistronic construct. So both ligand and receptor are on the same vector, each with their own expression elements.

The experiment: They transfected primary astrocyte cultures with this plasmid and used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. After that, in the Western blot, using total proteins, actin loading is proportional. So the blot is properly done.

Then, they breed a mouse model homozygous for the construct in the wt background. Then they cross it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. So the Cre is under the SOX10 promoter, I guess, which would express Cre in neural crest derivatives, like in the neural crest cells.

After the offspring are born, they visualize them under a confocal microscope. They expected to see green (from eGFP) but didn't. The question is why.

The options are A to D.

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But in this case, the construct is for the same cells, not sure. Not sure if this affects eGFP expression.

Option B: the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. So it's not trafficked to the cell surface. But why would that happen? Maybe the eGFP is not correctly processed. But how would that relate to the Cre expression?

Option C: the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. Well, the vector uses the CBA promoter for the ligand, which is strong. The receptor is under IRES, which is constitutive. So perhaps the construct doesn't have the right regulatory elements, but if the vector was properly made, maybe not. But in the question, the vector is correctly made, so maybe this is not the issue.

Option D: the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame. Oh, that's about whether the stop cassette is in frame when Cre is not present. So without Cre, the stop cassette is between the receptor and eGFP. If the stop is in frame, then the receptor is expressed as a fusion with eGFP? No, wait, no. Wait, the stop cassette is a transcriptional stop in between. So, without Cre, the eGFP is not expressed. But when Cre is present, it deletes the stop, allowing eGFP to be expressed.

Wait, but for the construct to work, when Cre is present, the stop cassettes are removed, allowing the expression of both mCherry (after ligand) and eGFP (after receptor). So in the mouse model, when the Cre is active, the eGFP should be expressed.

Wait, but the mice were crossed to SOX10-Cre. So in the offspring, the Cre is expressed in neural crest-derived cells. So in those cells, the construct should have been activated, and eGFP should be expressed.

But the result is that they don't see the green signal. So why is eGFP not being expressed?

Possible issues: The Cre isn't active, or the construct isn't getting into the right cells, or the eGFP isn't being expressed for another reason.

But according to the construct, in the presence of Cre (from SOX10-Cre), the loxP and lox2272 sites would recombine, removing the stop cassettes. So the ligand would be expressed with mCherry, and the receptor with eGFP.

But perhaps the problem is with the expression of Cre itself. If the Cre isn't active, then the stop cassettes remain, so the eGFP wouldn't be expressed.

Wait, but they crossed the homozygous construct mice (both alleles) to SOX10-Cre. So each offspring should have two copies of the construct (homozygous) and one copy of SOX10-Cre (hemizygous). So Cre should be active in the neural crest cells. So why isn't eGFP expressed?

Alternatively, perhaps the stop cassette isn't being correctly excised.

Wait, the ligand and receptor have different stop cassettes. The ligand side has loxP, and the receptor has lox2272. Wait, but the loxP and lox2272 are different. Wait, the loxP site is a 34 bp sequence, while lox2272 is a longer site (I think 33 bp, but perhaps it's a different arrangement). Cre can only recombine a loxP site with another loxP site, or with a compatible site. Lox2272 is a variant that can be used for recombination, but can Cre recombine loxP and lox2272 together?

Hmm, I might be getting this wrong. If the vector has a loxP site on the ligand side and a lox2272 on the receptor side, then when Cre is introduced, would the two sites recombine? Or would Cre only recombine the same site types?

Wait, the lox2272 is a loxP variant. If the two sites are loxP and lox2272, I think Cre cannot recombine them because Cre requires specific sequences. So if the two sites are different, Cre can't mediate recombination between them.

In the construct, the ligand has a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and the receptor has a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. So for each stop cassette, the same sites are used. So for the ligand's stop, the loxP sites flank the stop, and similarly for the receptor, the lox2272 sites flank the stop.

Wait, no. The ligand region is loxP-stop-loxP, so when Cre is present, it would excise the stop, allowing the mCherry to be expressed after the ligand.

The receptor region is lox2272-stop-lox2272. So Cre would excise the stop, allowing the eGFP to be expressed after the receptor.

But perhaps in the vector, it's designed so that a single Cre would recombine both. Wait, but if the ligand and receptor are on the same vector, and each has their own stop cassette, each flanked by their own lox sites, then each would need Cre to recombine their respective sites.

But perhaps the problem is that the loxP and lox2272 are different, and Cre can't recombine between different lox sites. So the ligand's stop can't be excised, but the receptor's stop can.

Wait, no, each stop cassette is flanked by same lox sites. So the ligand's stop is between two loxP sites, and the receptor's stop is between two lox2272 sites. So in that case, when Cre is present, it would excise each stop cassette on their respective sites. So the ligand and mCherry would be expressed, and the receptor and eGFP would be expressed.

But the question is that the eGFP isn't showing up. So perhaps the issue is elsewhere.

Wait, the vector is a bicistronic construct. So the same transcript is made for both ligand and receptor. The first ORF is the ligand, under CBA, then IRES, then the receptor. Or is it that the ligand is under CBA, and the receptor is under IRES?

Wait, the vector is described as a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. The ligand is at 5', under CBA, and the receptor is downstream, with IRES upstream. So the structure is: CBA promoter -> ligand ORF -> loxP-stop-loxP cassette -> mCherry ORF; then IRES -> receptor ORF -> lox2272-stop-lox2272 -> eGFP.

Wait, no, maybe the vector has two ORFs in a single transcript. So the first ORF is ligand under CBA, then after that, a stop cassette (loxP) for mCherry. Then, after IRES, the receptor ORF followed by a stop cassette (lox2272) for eGFP.

So when Cre is present, the stop cassettes are removed, allowing mCherry and eGFP to be expressed.

But the problem is that when they cross the mice with SOX10-Cre, they don't see eGFP. So perhaps the eGFP isn't being expressed.

Looking at the options again:

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Wait, when the stop cassette is removed, the receptor ORF is followed by eGFP. If they're not in frame, perhaps the eGFP isn't expressed correctly. Or, the stop cassette could cause a frameshift, but when Cre excises it, the reading frame would be correct.

Wait, the stop cassette is a transcriptional stop, not a translational stop. So in the absence of Cre, the mRNAs for ligand and receptor would include the stop cassette. So for the ligand, the mRNA would have the ligand sequence followed by the stop cassette, then mCherry. But without Cre, the stop is in between, so the ribosome would terminate, and mCherry wouldn't be expressed. Similarly, the receptor's mRNA would have the receptor sequence, then the stop, then eGFP. Without Cre, no eGFP.

But when Cre is expressed, it would excise the stop cassettes, allowing the mCherry and eGFP to be expressed.

But in the question, the mouse model doesn't show eGFP. So why?

Wait, maybe the Cre isn't active in the cells where the construct is expressed. But in this case, the Cre is under SOX10, which is active in neural crest cells. So if the construct is in neural crest cells, Cre is active, and the stop cassettes are excised.

But what if the construct isn't in the neural crest cells? Hmm, but the construct is in the mouse, and the Cre is only in neural crest. So if the construct is expressed elsewhere, but Cre isn't active there, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed, and the ligand would either be expressed or not.

Alternatively, perhaps the construct isn't getting into the right cells. But the question says that the expression was tested in primary astrocytes, which are not neural crest-derived, so perhaps the Cre isn't active in that case. But that's about the Western blot, not the mice.

Wait, the Western blot was done after transfecting primary astrocyte cultures. So in that case, without Cre, the stop cassettes are in place, so no mCherry or eGFP would be expressed. But in the Western blot, they're using antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So perhaps only the ligand and receptor would be expressed, but not the fluorescent proteins. So the Western blot may not show mCherry or eGFP because they're not expressed, but the ligand and receptor themselves would be. But the question says that the Western blot is using total proteins with actin loading. So the blot shows that ligand and receptor are expressed.

But the key is in the mouse. So when they cross to SOX10-Cre, the Cre should activate the construct in the neural crest-derived cells.

But the problem is that no green signal is observed. So perhaps the eGFP is not being produced.

Wait, another possibility: the IRES element isn't working properly. IRES allows for internal initiation of translation, so that the receptor and eGFP can be expressed from the same transcript as the ligand. But if the IRES is not functional, then the receptor won't be expressed.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not being correctly expressed because of a frameshift.

Wait, another thought: the loxP and lox2272 are different. So when Cre is introduced, it can't recombine between the two different sites. So the stop cassette for the receptor is flanked by lox2272, and Cre can't recombine that if the lox sites are different.

Wait, I thought that Cre can't recognize lox2272 unless it's the same as another lox2272. So if the ligand's stop is flanked by loxP and the receptor's stop by lox2272, then the Cre can only recombine each respective stop cassette, but perhaps the recombination doesn't occur because the two lox sites are different.

Wait, no, each stop cassette is flanked by the same types. The ligand's stop is between loxP, and the receptor's stop is between lox2272. So each site would be recombined independently. So when Cre is present in the cell, the ligand's stop (loxP) is excised, and the receptor's stop (lox2272) is also excised, allowing both mCherry and eGFP to be expressed.

But wait, in reality, Cre recombinase recognizes loxP sites. Lox2272 is a lox variant, but I'm not sure if Cre can recombine them. I think lox2272 is a site that is recognized by Cre, but it's a different sequence. So if a Cre is present, it can only recombine loxP sites with other loxP sites, and lox2272 sites with other lox2272 sites. So perhaps the lox2272 sites don't get recombined because the Cre can't recognize them. So in this case, the ligand's stop is between loxP sites, which Cre can recombine, so mCherry would be expressed. But the receptor's stop is between lox2272, which Cre can't recognize, so the stop remains, preventing eGFP expression.

Ah, that would be a problem. So the ligand's stop is flanked by loxP, allowing Cre to remove it, so mCherry is expressed. But the receptor's stop is flanked by lox2272, which isn't recognized by Cre, so the stop remains, and eGFP isn't expressed.

That would explain why only mCherry is expressed (if the ligand is expressed), but not eGFP. But in the question, the result is that the eGFP isn't expressed. So the correct option would be that the stop for the receptor isn't being excised because the lox sites are not recognized by Cre.

But looking at the options, none directly state that. So the options are A to D.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Hmm, but if the stop isn't excised, eGFP isn't expressed at all, which is the case here. Alternatively, perhaps the frame is wrong, but that would lead to a truncated protein if in frame, but perhaps not complete eGFP expression.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the lox sites are the same for the ligand and receptor, but in this case, they are different. So perhaps the stop cassettes are not both being excised.

Wait, but the question is about why eGFP isn't expressed. So if the stop between receptor and eGFP isn't being removed, then eGFP isn't expressed.

If the lox2272 sites aren't recognized by the Cre, then the stop remains, and eGFP isn't expressed. So the problem is that the Cre can't recombine the lox2272 sites.

But looking at the options, none of them directly address the lox site issue. So perhaps I'm missing another angle.

Wait, another possibility: The vector is a bicistronic construct, so the two ORFs are on the same mRNA. The ligand is first, then after IRES, the receptor. So for the eGFP to be expressed, the mRNA must be properly processed, and the IRES must function. If the IRES isn't functional, the receptor won't be translated.

But the question states that the vector was designed with the IRES upstream of the receptor. So perhaps the IRES is working, but if the stop cassette isn't removed, the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but in the presence of Cre, the stop cassette is removed. So if the eGFP isn't expressed, the stop must not have been removed. Which would happen if the lox2272 sites aren't recognized by Cre.

So perhaps the issue is that the Cre can't recognize the lox2272 sites. Therefore, the stop between receptor and eGFP remains, preventing its expression. So the eGFP isn't expressed.

But looking back at the options, none of them directly mention this. So perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the lox2272 wasn't removed, then the receptor would be expressed but eGFP not. Alternatively, if the stop remains, the eGFP isn't expressed.

But another possibility: In the vector, the eGFP is fused to the receptor, but in the same reading frame. If the stop cassette has a stop codon in between, perhaps the frame is shifted. But when the stop is removed, if the reading frame is correct, eGFP should be expressed.

Wait, no, the stop is a transcriptional stop, not a stop codon. So the mRNA would have the receptor sequence, then a stop (which is a transcriptional stop, so the rest isn't translated). So when Cre removes the stop, the mRNA continues beyond the receptor, allowing eGFP to be translated.

So the question is, why isn't eGFP expressed.

Another angle: The vector uses IRES for the receptor. If the IRES doesn't function, the receptor won't be translated. But the ligand would be translated under CBA.

But the problem is that the eGFP isn't expressed, so perhaps the IRES isn't working, but the question is about the construct.

Wait, the problem could be with the IRES element. If the IRES isn't functional, the receptor and eGFP won't be expressed even if the stop is removed.

But in this case, the presence of the IRES would allow the receptor to be expressed. So if the IRES isn't working, then the receptor wouldn't be expressed either. But in the question, the ligand is expressed, but the eGFP isn't. So perhaps the IRES is working.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the expression of the Cre isn't happening. But the mice were crossed with SOX10-Cre, which should express Cre in the neural crest cells.

Wait, another thought: The vector is a bicistronic construct, meaning both ligand and receptor are expressed in the same cell. But if the ligand and receptor are on the same construct, and if the ligand is secreted, then it could act on neighboring cells. But the question is about why the eGFP isn't expressed.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector isn't properly inserted into the genome, but the question states that the mouse is homozygous for the construct, so it's probably integrated correctly.

Wait, the SOX10-Cre is hemizygous. So the Cre is expressed in the neural crest cells. So in those cells, the Cre would excise the stop cassettes.

But maybe the lox2272 isn't the same as loxP, so Cre can't recombine it. Therefore, the stop cassette remains, and the eGFP isn't expressed. So the problem is that the lox sites are different.

But the options don't have this as an option. So perhaps the correct answer is D, the receptor and eGFP are not in frame.

Wait, another possibility. The ligand is under CBA, which is a strong constitutive promoter, while the receptor is under IRES, which allows for translation after the ligand. So when the stop is removed, the eGFP is expressed as part of the same mRNA.

But if the lox2272 isn't recombined, the stop remains. So the eGFP is not expressed.

So the problem is the lox2272 isn't recognized by Cre. So the stop isn't excised, eGFP not expressed.

But the options don't talk about lox sites. So perhaps the answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame.

Wait, but the stop is a transcriptional stop. So when the stop is removed, the mRNA continues beyond the receptor to eGFP. So the frame is correct because the stop was removed.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the eGFP is expressed, but not correctly trafficked. Option B says the receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. If the eGFP isn't correctly trafficked, it won't fluoresce. But that's a trafficking issue, not an expression issue. The question is about why the expression isn't happening.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is expressed, but the antibody isn't detecting it.

Wait, but in the question, the visualization is under confocal, using presumably GFP-specific filters. If the eGFP isn't expressed, no signal.

But why wouldn't it be expressed. Let's think again.

The vector has two stop cassettes. If the lox2272 sites aren't being recombined, then the stop remains, so eGFP isn't expressed.

But the question is in the context of the mouse. Suppose the vector's lox sites are loxP and lox2272. Cre can't recombine lox2272, so the stop remains, so eGFP isn't expressed.

But in the options, this isn't directly addressed. So perhaps the issue is with the frame.

Wait, if the stop is between the receptor and eGFP, and it's a transcriptional stop, then when Cre removes the stop, the mRNA continues, and the eGFP is expressed as a separate ORF. So the frame after the stop is correct.

So perhaps the issue is not with the frame. Then why isn't eGFP expressed.

Another angle: The vector's bicistronic construct requires both ORFs to be in the same reading frame. But the stop cassettes could affect this.

Wait, the ligand ORF is at 5', then the stop, then mCherry. The receptor ORF is after IRES, then stop, then eGFP. So perhaps when the stop is removed, the eGFP is in frame with the receptor.

But if the stop's removal doesn't correctly place the eGFP in frame with the receptor, then the eGFP won't be expressed.

Wait, but the eGFP is a separate ORF. So perhaps the frame isn't an issue.

Wait, maybe the vector was designed wrong. For example, the eGFP is in a different frame, so when the stop is removed, it's not correctly translated. But usually, the IRES would allow for separate translation.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's review the options again.

Option D: the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame. So when the stop is removed, the receptor's ORF continues into the eGFP, but if they're not in frame, the eGFP isn't expressed correctly. Or perhaps the eGFP is not expressed at all because it's not in the same reading frame as the receptor.

Wait, but the eGFP is after the stop. So when the stop is removed, the mRNA's reading frame for eGFP starts from the beginning of the eGFP ORF. So if the stop is correctly removed, the frame should be correct. So unless there's a frameshift in the stop cassette.

Wait, the stop cassette is a transcriptional stop, so the mRNA would have the receptor sequence, then a stop (which is a few nucleotides, perhaps a polyA signal or something), and then the eGFP sequence. So removing the stop would allow the eGFP to be expressed as its own ORF, in its own frame.

So perhaps the frames are correct, so option D isn't the issue.

Another possibility is that the eGFP isn't being properly expressed because the IRES isn't working. So the receptor is expressed, but the eGFP isn't. But that would mean the ligand is expressed, the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't. But without knowing about the IRES, that's hard to say.

Wait, looking back, the vector has the ligand under CBA, and the receptor under IRES. So the ligand's expression is driven by CBA, and the receptor's by IRES. So if the IRES isn't functional, the receptor isn't expressed, and eGFP isn't either. But in that case, both wouldn't be expressed.

But the question is about eGFP not being expressed, so perhaps the IRES is fine, and the ligand is expressed, but the eGFP isn't.

Hmm, perhaps the issue is with the stop cassettes. Let me think about the design again. For the ligand, the ORF is followed by a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, then mCherry. So without Cre, the ligand is expressed, but mCherry isn't. With Cre, the stop is removed, and mCherry is expressed.

Similarly, the receptor ORF is followed by a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette, then eGFP. Without Cre, the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't. With Cre, the stop is removed, and eGFP is expressed.

But if the Cre can't recombine the lox2272 sites, the stop remains, and eGFP isn't expressed.

But none of the options mention lox2272 not being recognized. So perhaps the correct answer is D, that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame.

Wait, but in that case, if they're not in frame, the eGFP would not be translated properly, but perhaps a truncated protein would be made, but that's not what's happening here. The question is that no eGFP is detected.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the IRES is after the receptor, so when the stop is removed, the eGFP is expressed as a separate ORF. But if the frame is wrong, the eGFP isn't translated correctly.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of the possible answers again.

Option A: ligand and receptor in a paracrine relationship. That means they act on different cells. But the construct is in the same cell, so they should be autocrine. But how does that affect eGFP expression? Maybe the ligand is secreted and acts on other cells, but the GFP is expressed in the same cell, so probably not the issue.

Option B: receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. If eGFP is a secreted protein or membrane-bound, it might not traffic correctly. But eGFP is a fluorescent marker, so it's probably cytoplasmic or nuclear. If it's stuck in Golgi, it wouldn't fluoresce, but the expression level would be low. But the question is about expression, not localization.

Option C: enhancer missing. The CBA promoter is constitutive, so missing enhancer wouldn't be the issue.

Option D: receptor and eGFP not in frame. So when the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, perhaps the frame is correct, but the problem is that the stop is in the way. So in the absence of Cre, the eGFP isn't expressed. But when Cre is present, the stop is removed, and eGFP is expressed.

But in this case, the Cre isn't removing the stop, so eGFP isn't expressed. So perhaps the issue is that the lox sites aren't recognized, making option D not the problem.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck, but based on the options, the most likely is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, leading to no eGFP expression. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the problem is that the Cre can't recombine the lox2272 sites, so the stop remains, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, another thought: the eGFP is fused to the receptor. So perhaps the eGFP is part of the same ORF as the receptor, but in that case, the stop would have to be removed to allow expression. But the way the question is structured, eGFP is at the C-terminus of the receptor. So the construct is receptor-eGFP.

But if the stop is not removed, then the eGFP isn't expressed. So why isn't the stop removed? Because the lox2272 sites aren't being recombined.

So perhaps the answer is none of the options, but since it's a multiple-choice question, the closest is D.

Wait, but the problem is with the stop cassette not being removed. So maybe the issue is that the lox sites are different, but the options don't include that. Therefore, the correct answer must be another option.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES is placed in a way that doesn't allow proper expression. But without knowing the design specifics, it's hard to say.

Wait, another angle: the IRES is after the receptor ORF. So the receptor is expressed, but the eGFP is under the IRES. So the eGFP would be expressed as a separate ORF. If the stop is removed, the eGFP should be expressed. But if the stop isn't removed, it's not expressed.

So the problem is that the stop isn't removed. Which would be due to the lox sites not being compatible with Cre.

But since none of the options address this, perhaps the intended answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Because when the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't in the correct frame, so it isn't expressed.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the lox sites are different, and the stop isn't excised, leading to no eGFP expression. But since this isn't an option, perhaps I should reevaluate.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector wasn't properly designed, and the eGFP is not under the correct promoter. Hmm, but the question says the ligand is under CBA, and the receptor is after IRES.

Wait, the absence of a promoter for the receptor's expression isn't the case because IRES allows for translation.

Hmm. I think I've thought through this as much as I can. Based on the options, the most likely answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. So when the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't translated correctly, so no fluorescence.


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector designed to express a ligand and receptor pair in neural crest cells. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, followed by a loxP-stop-loxP cassette and mCherry, while the receptor is under an IRES element, followed by a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette and eGFP. The vector was introduced into mice homozygous for the construct, which were crossed with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. Despite this, no green fluorescence from eGFP was observed under confocal microscopy. The task is to determine the most likely reason for this outcome.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   This option suggests that the ligand acts on neighboring cells, while the receptor is expressed elsewhere. However, the construct is designed for co-expression in the same cell, and the absence of eGFP fluorescence is due to a failure in expression, not paracrine signaling. This does not explain the observed result.

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If eGFP were stuck in the Golgi, it would likely result in improper trafficking and localization rather than a complete absence of expression. The question specifically asks why eGFP is not expressed, making this option unlikely.

3. **Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The ligand is under the strong constitutive CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES element, which allows for translation. There is no indication that an enhancer is missing or required for the expression of these elements. This does not explain the lack of eGFP expression.

4. **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame**  
   The stop cassettes (loxP for the ligand and lox2272 for the receptor) are designed to block expression in the absence of Cre. When Cre is present, these cassettes are excised, allowing mCherry and eGFP to be expressed. However, if the receptor and eGFP are not in the correct reading frame after the stop cassette is removed, eGFP would not be properly translated. This could explain the absence of fluorescence. While the issue might also be related to the compatibility of the lox2272 sites with Cre (which is not explicitly addressed in the options), this explanation aligns most closely with the provided choices.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation for the absence of eGFP fluorescence is that the receptor and eGFP are not in the correct reading frame, preventing proper translation of eGFP.
