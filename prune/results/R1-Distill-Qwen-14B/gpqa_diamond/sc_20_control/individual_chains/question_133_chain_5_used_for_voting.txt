Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is the same as 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 grams each of KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The molecular weights are given: KH₂PO₄ is 136.09 g/mol and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O is 177.99 g/mol. The temperature is 25°C. I need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO₄³⁻, in this solution.

Wait, orthophosphate is PO₄³⁻, right? So the problem is about the concentration of that ion in the solution. The options are all in the order of 1e-7 M, so it's a pretty dilute solution.

I remember that phosphate exists in different forms depending on the pH. Since we have both KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄, which are different salts of phosphoric acid, their dissolution in water will affect the pH and the speciation of phosphate ions.

Phosphoric acid, H₃PO₄, has three dissociation steps with their respective Ka values given: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. So each step is much weaker than the previous, meaning the solution is probably in a range where both H2PO4⁻ and HPO4^2- are present. But wait, the presence of both KH₂PO4 and Na2HPO4 might buffer the solution around a certain pH.

KH₂PO4 is hydrogen potassium phosphate, which dissociates into K+ and H2PO4⁻. Na2HPO4·2H2O is disodium hydrogen phosphate, which would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

Wait a second, so if I have both H2PO4⁻ and HPO4^2- in solution, they can interconvert. But orthophosphate is PO4^3-, which is the deprotonated form from HPO4^2-. But under what conditions does HPO4^2- deprotonate further to form PO4^3-?

The third Ka is Ka3 = 1.8e-12, which is for the reaction HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-. So, the concentration of PO4^3- depends on the pH of the solution. If the pH is high enough, more HPO4^2- will deprotonate to form PO4^3-.

But wait, the solution is a mixture of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4. I think this is a buffer solution because it contains a weak acid and its conjugate base. So, I can calculate the pH first using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, and then see the concentration of PO4^3- based on that pH.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the ratio of HPO4^2- to PO4^3- using the third Ka and the pH of the solution.

But first, let's calculate the moles of each component.

Moles of KH2PO4: mass is 1.00 g. Molar mass is 136.09 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007343 mol.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: mass is 1.00 g. Molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005602 mol.

Wait, but what's the formula for Na2HPO4·2H2O? The formula is Na2HPO4·2H2O, which is the same as Na2HPO4 plus 2 H2O. So when it dissolves, it gives 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So, both salts contribute HPO4^2- and another form. Wait, KH2PO4 gives H2PO4^-.

Wait, no. Let me think again. KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So in solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But how does that affect the pH? Well, the presence of both a weak acid (H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-) means this is a buffer solution, and the pH can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). Here, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-. So the relevant pKa is Ka2, because that's the step where H2PO4^- loses a proton to become HPO4^2-.

Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 is log(1/(6.2e-8)) = approximately 7.21 (since 6.2e-8 is 6.2 x10^-8, so log(6.2) is ~0.79, so 8 - 0.79 =7.21? Wait, no. Wait, pKa = -log(Ka). So pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8).

Let me compute that: log(6.2) is about 0.79, so 6.2e-8 is 6.2 x 10^-8, so log(6.2e-8) is 0.79 -8 = -7.21. So pKa2 is 7.21.

So the ratio [base]/[acid] is [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-].

Calculating the moles: H2PO4^- comes from KH2PO4, which is 0.007343 mol. HPO4^2- comes from Na2HPO4·2H2O, which is 0.005602 mol. But wait, the volume is 0.2 L, so concentrations are moles/volume.

So [HPO4^2-] = 0.005602 mol / 0.2 L = 0.02801 M.

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007343 / 0.2 = 0.036715 M.

So log([base]/[acid]) = log(0.02801 / 0.036715) ≈ log(0.763) ≈ -0.116.

So pH = 7.21 + (-0.116) ≈ 7.094.

Wait, but wait a minute. The Henderson equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). So if the ratio is less than 1, the log is negative, so pH is less than pKa. So our pH is around 7.094.

Now, considering the dissociation of HPO4^2- into PO4^3- and H+:

HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

This is the third dissociation step, with Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

Alternatively, using the equilibrium expression for this step, the concentration of PO4^3- would depend on the pH. Because if the pH is higher than pKa3, then more PO4^3- forms.

Wait, what's pKa3? It's the negative log of Ka3: pKa3 = -log(1.8e-12) ≈ 11.74.

So at pH 7.094, which is lower than pKa3, so the solution is on the acidic side of the third dissociation. Thus, the concentration of PO4^3- would be small because the solution is not basic enough to deprotonate HPO4^2-.

Wait, but how much? Let's think.

Because the solution's pH is 7.094, which is much lower than pKa3 of 11.74, so the predominant form of phosphate is HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-.

But we are to find the concentration of PO4^3-.

So, using the equilibrium expression for the third dissociation:

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-].

We can rearrange for [PO4^3-]:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

But [H+] can be found from the pH. pH is 7.094, so [H+] = 10^-7.094 ≈ 8.29e-8 M.

So, plugging the numbers:

Ka3 = 1.8e-12,

[HPO4^2-] ≈ 0.02801 M,

[H+] ≈ 8.29e-8.

So,

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02801) / 8.29e-8.

Let me compute that:

1.8e-12 * 0.02801 ≈ (1.8 * 0.02801) * 1e-12 ≈ 0.050418e-12 = 5.0418e-14.

Divide by 8.29e-8:

5.0418e-14 / 8.29e-8 ≈ (5.0418 /8.29) * 1e-6.

5.0418 /8.29 ≈ 0.607.

So 0.607e-6 M = 6.07e-7 M.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close. But wait, maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me check the steps again.

Wait, let me re-calculate the pH.

Wait, the moles of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are 0.007343 and 0.005602, respectively. The ratio [base]/[acid] is 0.005602 / 0.007343 ≈ 0.763. So log(0.763) is approximately -0.114.

So pH = pKa2 (7.21) + (-0.114) = 7.096, which is about 7.096. So [H+] is 1e-7.096 ≈ 8.23e-8, as before.

Wait, but wait another thing: the initial assumption is that the concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.02801 M and H2PO4^- is 0.036715 M. Are these the only sources of phosphate in the solution? Because phosphate can also come from the dissociation of other species, but in this case, yes, because the solution is made by mixing these two salts.

So, the calculation should proceed as I did.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02801) / (8.23e-8).

Wait, let me compute this with more precise numbers.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02801.

1.8 * 0.02801 = 0.050418.

So 0.050418e-12 = 5.0418e-14.

Denominator: 8.23e-8.

5.0418e-14 / 8.23e-8 = (5.0418 / 8.23) * 1e-6.

5.0418 /8.23 is approximately 0.612.

So 0.612e-6 M = 6.12e-7 M.

Wait, but that's 6.12e-7, which is close to option A, which is 6.24e-7.

Hmm, but why is the option D 3.97e-7? Did I miss something?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the moles. Let me recheck.

Calculate moles of KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol.

136.09 is approximately 136.1. 1 / 136.1 is about 0.007342 mol. So that's correct.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol.

177.99 is approximately 178.0. 1/178 = 0.005618, but more accurately 1.00 / 177.99 is approximately 0.005602 mol. Correct.

So the moles are correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the concentrations as exact as possible.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005602 / 0.2 = 0.02801 M.

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007343 / 0.2 = 0.036715 M.

pH = pKa2 + log(0.02801/0.036715) = 7.21 + log(0.763) = 7.21 + (-0.114) = 7.096.

[H+] = 1e-7.096 ≈ 8.23e-8 M.

Now, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

So (1.8e-12 * 0.02801) / 8.23e-8.

Compute numerator again: 1.8e-12 * 0.02801 = 5.0418e-14.

Divide by 8.23e-8: 5.0418e-14 / 8.23e-8 = (5.0418 /8.23) * 1e-6.

5.0418 /8.23 → Let me compute that more accurately.

8.23 × 0.61 = 5.0413. Oh, wait, that's exactly 0.61!

So 5.0418 /8.23 ≈ 0.61.

So [PO4^3-] ≈ 0.61e-6 M = 6.1e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is a bit higher. But my approximation gave 6.1e-7, which is close to that. However, perhaps I made a rounding error in the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the ratio more accurately.

Let me compute [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.005602 / 0.007343 = 0.763 exactly.

Log(0.763) is approximately -0.114, as I did before.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the pH more precisely. Let me compute 0.005602 / 0.007343 = 0.763.

Log(0.763) = ?

Let me think: log(0.7) is -0.1549, log(0.75) is -0.1249, log(0.763):

Using linear approximation between 0.75 and 0.8.

At 0.75: log= -0.1249.

At 0.8: log= -0.09691.

Difference over 0.05 is 0.028. From 0.75 to 0.763 is 0.013, so 0.013 /0.05 = 0.26. So log increases by (0.028)*0.26 ≈ 0.00728.

So log(0.763) ≈ (-0.1249) + 0.00728 ≈ -0.1176.

So pH = 7.21 - 0.1176 = 7.0924.

So [H+] = 10^(-7.0924) ≈ 8.2e-8? Let me compute 10^(-7.0924):

10^(-7) is 1e-7.

7.0924 = 7 + 0.0924.

So 10^(-0.0924) = 1 / (10^0.0924).

Compute 10^0.0924 ≈ 1.237 (since 0.09 is about 1.23, 0.0924 is a bit higher).

Wait, 10^0.09 = approx 1.23.

So 10^(-0.0924) ≈ 0.809.

So [H+] = 8.09e-8 M.

Wait, wait, no: 10^(-7.0924) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.0924) = (1e-7) * 0.809 ≈ 8.09e-8.

So [H+] is approximately 8.09e-8 M.

Now, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02801) / 8.09e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02801 = 5.0418e-14.

Divide by 8.09e-8: 5.0418e-14 /8.09e-8 = (5.0418 /8.09) * 1e-6.

5.0418 /8.09 → Let me compute this more accurately.

8.09 × 0.62 = 5.0278. So 0.62 gives 5.0278, which is very close to 5.0418.

Difference: 5.0418 -5.0278=0.014. So 0.014 /8.09 ≈ 0.00173.

So total is 0.62 +0.00173≈ 0.62173.

So [PO4^3-] ≈ 0.62173e-6 =6.2173e-7 M.

Ah, now that's about 6.22e-7 M, which is very close to option A, which is 6.24e-7.

But wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the calculations.

Wait, let me compute 5.0418 /8.09.

8.09 * 0.62 = 5.0278.

So 5.0418 -5.0278 = 0.014.

0.014 /8.09 = approximately 0.00173.

So 0.62 + 0.00173 = 0.62173.

So 0.62173e-6 M = 6.2173e-7 M.

Which rounds to 6.22e-7 M. The options have option A as 6.24e-7. Hmm, perhaps the initial approximation for the pH was a bit off, or perhaps I should consider other factors.

Wait, another way: perhaps I should include activity coefficients, but that's beyond what I think is expected here. The problem seems designed for a simpler approach.

Wait, another thing to consider: when calculating the concentration of PO4^3-, perhaps we should account for the total phosphate concentration, but I think in this case, the assumption is that the concentration of PO4^3- is much smaller than that of the other species, so it can be calculated directly from the third dissociation.

Alternatively, maybe the [HPO4^2-] is not exactly 0.02801 M because some of it may have dissociated into PO4^3- and H+. But wait, since [PO4^3-] is so small (around 6e-7 M), the change in [HPO4^2-] is negligible, so the initial concentration is fine.

So, with the calculation giving approximately 6.22e-7 M, which is very close to option A (6.24e-7), but let me check the other options.

Options are:

A) 6.24x10^-7 M

B)5.48x10^-7 M

C)2.81x10^-7 M

D)3.97x10^-7 M

So 6.22e-7 is closest to A.

But wait, wait another thing: when we compute [PO4^3-], perhaps we should consider that the HPO4^2- comes from two sources: the Na2HPO4 and any that comes from the dissociation of KH2PO4.

Wait, no, KH2PO4 dissociates into H2PO4^-, and Na2HPO4 into HPO4^2-.

Wait, in solution, the HPO4^2- can act as a base or an acid, but in this case, we have a buffer solution. So the main species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But when considering the third dissociation, HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

So the concentration of PO4^3- is determined by the pH and the concentration of HPO4^2-.

I think I accounted for that in my earlier calculation.

Another possible mistake is in the initial calculation of pH.

Wait, let me recalculate the pH.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02801 M.

[H2PO4^-] =0.036715 M.

So the ratio is 0.02801 / 0.036715 = 0.763.

pH = pKa2 + log(0.763) =7.21 + (-0.114)=7.096.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps the total phosphate concentration includes all forms, but the problem only asks for PO4^3-.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution considers that the concentration of PO4^3- is the same as the concentration of HPO4^2- multiplied by (Ka3/Kw) ?

Wait, no. Because Kw is for water autoionization, but in this case, the relevant expression is Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-].

So [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 [HPO4^2-])/ [H+].

Which is what I did.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the concentration of HPO4^2- as a buffer and not consider the dissociation into PO4^3-.

But the question is about orthophosphate, which is PO4^3-.

So I think my approach is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of [H+].

Wait, pH =7.096 → [H+] = 10^-7.096 = 8.20e-8.

Wait, 10^-7 is 1e-7. 10^-0.096 is about 0.820. So [H+] is 8.2e-8.

So, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02801) / 8.2e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02801 =5.0418e-14.

Denominator:8.2e-8.

So 5.0418e-14 /8.2e-8 = (5.0418 /8.2) * 1e-6.

5.0418 /8.2 → 5.0418 ÷8.2.

8.2 × 0.614 =5.0408 (since 8.2 ×0.6=4.92, 8.2 ×0.014=0.1148; total 4.92+0.1148=5.0348). Hmm, 0.614 gives 5.0348, which is 5.0418-5.0348=0.007.

So 0.007/8.2=0.0008536.

So total is 0.614 +0.0008536≈0.61485.

So 0.61485e-6=6.1485e-7 M.

Which is approximately 6.15e-7 M.

Still close to option A (6.24e-7).

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the exact pH calculation, which might give a slightly different [H+].

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise log calculations.

Wait, let me compute the log(0.763) more accurately.

Log (0.763) → I can use a calculator approach.

We know that log(0.7) is -0.1549, log(0.75) is -0.1249, log(0.763) is between those.

Let me use the linear approximation. Between 0.75 and 0.8, the change in log is from -0.1249 to -0.09691.

The difference is 0.75 to 0.8 is 0.05 in x, and the log increases by 0.028.

So 0.763 is 0.013 above 0.75.

So fraction is 0.013 /0.05 = 0.26.

So the change in log is 0.028 * 0.26 ≈ 0.00728.

So log(0.763) ≈ -0.1249 +0.00728 ≈ -0.1176.

So pH =7.21 -0.1176=7.0924.

Wait, so [H+] =10^-7.0924.

Let me compute this more accurately.

7.0924 = 7 + 0.0924.

10^-0.0924 = ?

We can compute this using natural logs or known values.

We know that ln(10^x) =x * ln(10).

Alternatively, use the Taylor series for 10^x around x=0.

But perhaps a better approach is to use a calculator-like method.

We know that 10^0.09= approximately 1.23 (since 10^0.07918 ≈ 1.2, as 10^0.07918=2^0.3 ≈1.23).

Wait, 10^0.1 ≈1.2589.

Wait, but I need 10^0.0924.

Assuming that between 0.09 and 0.1, the value increases from 1.23 to 1.2589.

The difference between 0.09 and 0.1 is 0.01, which corresponds to 0.0289 in the 10^x.

So 0.0924 is 0.0024 above 0.09.

So, 0.0024 /0.01 = 0.24.

So, 10^0.0924 ≈1.23 +0.24*(1.2589-1.23) =1.23 +0.24*(0.0289)=1.23+0.006936=1.2369.

So 10^0.0924≈1.2369.

So 10^-0.0924 =1/1.2369≈0.8075.

Thus, [H+] =1e-7 *0.8075 ≈8.075e-8 M.

Now, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02801) /8.075e-8.

Compute numerator:1.8e-12 *0.02801=5.0418e-14.

Denominator:8.075e-8.

So 5.0418e-14 /8.075e-8 = (5.0418 /8.075) *1e-6.

Compute 5.0418 /8.075.

8.075 ×0.623 = let's see:

8.075 ×0.6=4.845.

8.075 ×0.02=0.1615.

8.075 ×0.003=0.024225.

Adding them:4.845 +0.1615=5.0065 +0.024225=5.030725.

So 8.075 ×0.623=5.030725.

Our numerator is 5.0418, which is 5.030725 +0.011075.

So, 0.011075 /8.075 ≈0.001372.

So total is 0.623 + 0.001372=0.624372.

So [PO4^3-] ≈0.624372e-6 M =6.2437e-7 M.

Which is approximately 6.24e-7 M, matching option A exactly.

So the correct answer should be option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the given system, which contains 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O in 200.00 cm³ (0.2 L) of solution. The dissociation behavior of phosphate species is governed by the equilibrium constants for phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄):  

- **Ka₁ = 7.5 × 10⁻³**  
- **Ka₂ = 6.2 × 10⁻⁸**  
- **Ka₃ = 1.8 × 10⁻¹²**  

### Step 1: Moles of phosphate species
- **KH₂PO₄ dissociates into H₂PO₄⁻ and K⁺:**  
  Moles of H₂PO₄⁻ = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.007343 \, \text{mol} \).  
- **Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O dissociates into HPO₄²⁻ and Na⁺:**  
  Moles of HPO₄²⁻ = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005602 \, \text{mol} \).  

### Step 2: Concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻
The total volume of the solution is 0.2 L, so:  
- \([H₂PO₄⁻] = \frac{0.007343 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.036715 \, \text{M}\),  
- \([HPO₄²⁻] = \frac{0.005602 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.02801 \, \text{M}\).  

### Step 3: pH of the solution
The solution is a buffer containing H₂PO₄⁻ (weak acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (its conjugate base). Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{base}]}{[\text{acid}]} \right),
\]  
where \(\text{p}K_a = -\log(K_a)\). For the second dissociation (Ka₂ = 6.2 × 10⁻⁸), \(\text{p}K_a = 7.21\). Substituting the concentrations:  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.21 + \log \left( \frac{0.02801}{0.036715} \right).
\]  
The ratio \(\frac{0.02801}{0.036715} \approx 0.763\), and \(\log(0.763) \approx -0.114\). Thus:  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.21 - 0.114 = 7.096.
\]  

### Step 4: Concentration of PO₄³⁻
The third dissociation of HPO₄²⁻ is:  
\[
\text{HPO₄²⁻} \leftrightarrow \text{H⁺} + \text{PO₄³⁻}.
\]  
The equilibrium constant is \(K_a = 1.8 \times 10^{-12}\), and the relationship is:  
\[
K_a = \frac{[\text{H⁺}][\text{PO₄³⁻}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}.
\]  
Rearranging for \([\text{PO₄³⁻}]\):  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{K_a \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H⁺}]}.
\]  
From the pH, \([\text{H⁺}] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.096} \approx 8.09 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}\). Substituting values:  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02801)}{8.09 \times 10^{-8}}.
\]  
First, calculate the numerator:  
\[
(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02801) \approx 5.0418 \times 10^{-14}.
\]  
Then divide by the denominator:  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{5.0418 \times 10^{-14}}{8.09 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]
