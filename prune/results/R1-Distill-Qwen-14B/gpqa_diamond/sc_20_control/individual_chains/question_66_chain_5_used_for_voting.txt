Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to think this through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options given are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, what do I remember about symmetries in quantum field theories? So, I know that the Standard Model respects certain symmetries, and SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates higher-dimensional operators. Effective theories usually follow the same symmetries as the underlying theory because they just modify the interactions without changing the basic principles.

Lorentz symmetry is a big one. I'm pretty sure that any operator in the theory must respect Lorentz symmetry. Because if you don't, you're introducing terms that don't respect relativity, which is a fundamental principle. So all operators must be Lorentz scalars or tensors that transform properly under Lorentz transformations. So Lorentz symmetry (option 1) is definitely one of the required symmetries.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Wait, Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So if a theory respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. But wait, SMEFT is an effective theory which is built to be valid up to some cutoff scale. The effective theory would still respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model, which includes Poincare symmetry. Or does it? Because Poincare symmetry includes momentum conservation, which is tied to translational symmetry. But effective theories are valid in a certain energy range, but do they necessarily respect all of Poincare? I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, wait. Wait, the Poincare group includes the Lorentz group and the translations, so if a theory doesn't have a preferred frame, it should respect Poincare. But wait, in SMEFT, the operators are written in a way that they are valid up to some scale. Are the operators required to respect Poincare? Hmm. Because if you have higher-dimension operators, they can have terms that are non-renormalizable, but they should still respect the same symmetries as the SM, which includes Poincare. So I think all operators must respect Poincare symmetry as well. So that's option 2.

Wait, but wait another thought. Do the higher-dimension operators themselves have to respect Poincare symmetry? I mean, they should respect the same symmetries as the SM, right? Because the SM is the theory they are extending. So yes, operators must form Poincare-invariant terms. So both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries must be respected. So 1 and 2 are correct.

Now, CP symmetry. The Standard Model doesn't respect CP symmetry in general. For example, CP violation is present in the CKM matrix. So if the SM doesn't respect CP, then SMEFT, which is an effective theory built on top, doesn't have to either. Wait, but the question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if the underlying theory (SM) doesn't respect a symmetry, does the effective theory (SMEFT) also not need to respect it? Or is that not the case? Hmm.

Wait, but maybe the operators in SMEFT are constructed in a way that they preserve certain symmetries. For example, the SM is CP-violating, so operators in SMEFT can also be CP-violating. So not all operators need to respect CP. So CP symmetry (option 3) is not necessarily a must. So the operator doesn't have to respect CP. So 3 is not correct.

What about CPT symmetry? I remember that in quantum field theory, all theories must respect CPT symmetry. Because it's a fundamental symmetry, right? Even if a theory violates C or P, it must conserve CPT. For example, the Standard Model respects CPT. So any effective theory like SMEFT must also respect CPT. So option 4 is correct.

Putting it all together. The symmetries that must be respected by all operators are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). Wait, is that right? Because earlier I thought 1 and 2 are both correct, and 4 is correct. So the options would include 1, 2, and 4.

Looking at the options: option C is 1,2,4. Option C is choice C) 1,2,4. Wait, but the options for the question are:

Options:
A) 1,2
B) 3,4
C) 1,2,4
D) 1,3,4

So the correct answer would include 1,2,4. So option C.

Wait, but wait another thing. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry. So when you respect Poincare, you automatically respect Lorentz. So in the question, they are asking which are "must be respected". So the operators must respect Lorentz (1) and Poincare (2). But wait, if Poincare includes Lorentz, then why is Lorentz listed as a separate option? Because the question is which symmetries must be respected, perhaps both are required. Or maybe the question is considering Poincare as separate from Lorentz, but in reality, you can't have Poincare without Lorentz.

Wait, but perhaps the original question is phrased as which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So, the SMEFT must respect all the symmetries of the SM. The SM respects Poincare (which includes Lorentz), so SMEFT must respect Poincare. Therefore, any operator must be a Poincare invariant operator, which implies it's also Lorentz invariant. So perhaps the correct answer includes both 1 and 2, and 4.

So, the correct options are 1, 2, and 4. So the correct answer is option C.

The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). To determine the correct answer, we analyze each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: This is a fundamental symmetry in relativistic quantum field theories, including SMEFT. All operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry because they describe interactions consistent with special relativity.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translational symmetry. Since SMEFT is an effective theory built on the Standard Model, which respects Poincaré symmetry, all operators in SMEFT must also respect Poincaré symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model does not respect CP symmetry due to CP violation (e.g., in the CKM matrix). Consequently, SMEFT operators are not required to respect CP symmetry. Therefore, this symmetry is not a must for all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory, including the Standard Model. SMEFT, being an effective theory, must also respect CPT symmetry for consistency.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
