Okay, so I'm looking at this quantum mechanics problem, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question says we have two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. Oh wait, p orbitals have l=1, right? So each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l=1. But wait, the problem says to ignore their spin angular momentum, so we're only dealing with the orbital part here.

The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l₁, l₂, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Hmm, okay. So l₁ and l₂ are both 1, which makes sense because each is a p orbital. Then the total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and m is -1.

The question is about the joint probability of measuring both L₁z and L₂z to be -ħ. So each L_z is the z-component of orbital angular momentum for each electron. Remember that L_z for a state with quantum number l has eigenvalues m * ħ. So for each electron, if their individual m's are m₁ and m₂, then L₁z = m₁ ħ and L₂z = m₂ ħ.

Wait, but in the coupled state, m is the total m. So for the coupled state |1,1,2,-1>, the total m is -1. But in the coupled state, the individual m's (m₁ and m₂) can vary as long as m₁ + m₂ = total m.

Wait, but how does that tie into the probability? Because the problem is about measuring each L_z and finding both to be -ħ. So each L_z would be measured as -ħ, which corresponds to m₁ = -1 and m₂ = -1. Because L_z eigenvalues are m * ħ. So if both are -ħ, then each m is -1.

So the question is: what's the probability that, in the given state, both electrons have m₁=-1 and m₂=-1.

Wait, but the state is |1,1,2,-1>. That's a coupled state. So in this state, the total m is -1, which is the sum of m₁ and m₂. So m₁ + m₂ = -1. But we're looking for both m₁ and m₂ being -1. Let's see: if both are -1, then their sum is -2. But the total m here is -1. So that's impossible. So the probability is zero?

Wait, let me think again. The total m is the sum of individual m's. So in our case, the coupled state has m = -1, so m₁ + m₂ = -1. If we're measuring m₁ = -1 and m₂ =-1, then their sum is -2, which doesn't match the total m of -1. So this particular combination (m₁=-1, m₂=-1) cannot be present in this state. So the probability of this happening is zero.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the possible states that make up the coupled state. The coupled state |l₁, l₂, l, m> is a superposition of the product states |m₁, m₂>, right? Because the total state is a combination of all possible m₁ and m₂ such that m₁ + m₂ = M, where M is the total m in the coupled state.

So for the given state, l=2, m=-1. The possible m₁ and m₂ pairs are those that add up to -1. What are the possible m₁ and m₂ values? Since each l can be -1, 0, +1.

So for l=1, m₁ can be -1, 0, +1. Similarly for m₂. So all possible pairs where m₁ + m₂ = -1.

So let's list all possible (m₁, m₂) pairs:

1. m₁ = -1, m₂ = 0 → sum is -1
2. m₁ = 0, m₂ = -1 → sum is -1
3. m₁ = 1, m₂ = -2 → but m₂ can't be -2 because for l=1, m can only be -1, 0, +1. So this combination isn't allowed.

Wait, so the only allowed pairs are (m₁=-1, m₂=0) and (m₁=0, m₂=-1). Are there any other possibilities? Let me check.

Wait, m₁ can be 1, m₂ would need to be -2, which is impossible. So only two possibilities.

So the state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of |m₁=-1, m₂=0> and |m₁=0, m₂=-1>.

Therefore, when you express |1,1,2,-1> in terms of the product states, it's a linear combination of these two m states.

So the probability of each individual (m₁, m₂) pair is determined by the coefficients in this combination.

Wait, but how? If the state |1,1,2,-1> is a linear combination of |m₁=-1, m₂=0> and |m₁=0, m₂=-1>, then the probability of each is the square of the coefficient's absolute value.

But what are the coefficients? Hmm, I think the coefficients depend on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. But maybe for this problem, I don't need to calculate them explicitly because the question is about the joint probability of both m being -1, which we saw earlier is impossible.

Wait another way: if I measure L₁z and L₂z, each can be -ħ, 0, or +ħ. But for the total m to be -1, the sum must be -1. If both are -1, sum is -2, which is not allowed. So the state can't have both m's as -1. So the probability is zero.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is a combination where that's not possible. So the probability of both being -1 is zero.

Looking back at the options, option D is 0. So the answer should be D.

The problem involves two electrons in a coupled angular momentum state $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$, where $l_1 = 1$, $l_2 = 1$, $l = 2$, and $m = -1$. The goal is to determine the joint probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$, which corresponds to $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.

For the coupled state $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$, the total $m$ is $-1$, which means $m_1 + m_2 = -1$. The possible pairs of $(m_1, m_2)$ that satisfy this condition are:

1. $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, 0)$
2. $(m_1, m_2) = (0, -1)$

The combination $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, -1)$ is not allowed because it would give $m_1 + m_2 = -2$, which does not match the total $m = -1$ of the coupled state. Therefore, the state $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$ does not include the $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, -1)$ component.

Since the $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, -1)$ combination is absent in the coupled state, the probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$ is zero.

Okay, so I'm looking at this quantum mechanics problem, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question says we have two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. Oh wait, p orbitals have l=1, right? So each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l=1.

The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l₁, l₂, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Hmm, okay. So l₁ and l₂ are both 1, which makes sense because each is a p orbital. Then the total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and m is -1.

The question is about the joint probability of measuring both L₁z and L₂z to be -ħ. So each L_z is the z-component of orbital angular momentum for each electron. Remember that L_z for a state with quantum number l has eigenvalues m * ħ. So for each electron, if their individual m's are m₁ and m₂, then L₁z = m₁ ħ and L₂z = m₂ ħ.

Wait, but in the coupled state, m is the total m. So for the coupled state |1,1,2,-1>, the total m is -1. But in the coupled state, the individual m's (m₁ and m₂) can vary as long as m₁ + m₂ = total m.

Wait, but how does that tie into the probability? Because the problem is about measuring each L_z and finding both to be -ħ. So each L_z would be measured as -ħ, which corresponds to m₁ = -1 and m₂ = -1. Because L_z eigenvalues are m * ħ. So if both are -ħ, then each m is -1.

So the question is: what's the probability that, in the given state, both electrons have m₁=-1 and m₂=-1.

Wait, but the state is |1,1,2,-1>. That's a coupled state. So in this state, the total m is -1, which is the sum of m₁ and m₂. So m₁ + m₂ = -1. But we're looking for both m₁ and m₂ being -1. Let's see: if both are -1, then their sum is -2. But the total m here is -1. So that's impossible. So the probability is zero?

Wait, let me think again. The total m is the sum of individual m's. So in our case, the coupled state has m = -1, so m₁ + m₂ = -1. If we're measuring m₁ = -1 and m₂ =-1, then their sum is -2, which doesn't match the total m of -1. So this particular combination (m₁=-1, m₂=-1) cannot be present in this state. So the probability of this happening is zero.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the possible states that make up the coupled state. The coupled state |l₁, l₂, l, m> is a superposition of the product states |m₁, m₂>, right? Because the total state is a combination of all possible m₁ and m₂ such that m₁ + m₂ = M, where M is the total m in the coupled state.

So for the given state, l=2, m=-1. The possible m₁ and m₂ pairs are those that add up to -1. What are the possible m₁ and m₂ values? Since each l can be -1, 0, +1.

So for l=1, m₁ can be -1, 0, +1. Similarly for m₂. So all possible pairs where m₁ + m₂ = -1.

So let's list all possible (m₁, m₂) pairs:

1. m₁ = -1, m₂ = 0 → sum is -1
2. m₁ = 0, m₂ = -1 → sum is -1
3. m₁ = 1, m₂ = -2 → but m₂ can't be -2 because for l=1, m can only be -1, 0, +1. So this combination isn't allowed.

Wait, so the only allowed pairs are (m₁=-1, m₂=0) and (m₁=0, m₂=-1). Are there any other possibilities? Let me check.

Wait, m₁ can be 1, m₂ would need to be -2, which is impossible. So only two possibilities.

So the state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of |m₁=-1, m₂=0> and |m₁=0, m₂=-1>.

Therefore, when you express |1,1,2,-1> in terms of the product states, it's a linear combination of these two m states.

So the probability of each individual (m₁, m₂) pair is determined by the coefficients in this combination.

Wait, but how? If the state |1,1,2,-1> is a linear combination of |m₁=-1, m₂=0> and |m₁=0, m₂=-1>, then the probability of each is the square of the coefficient's absolute value.

But what are the coefficients? Hmm, I think the coefficients depend on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. But maybe for this problem, I don't need to calculate them explicitly because the question is about the joint probability of both m being -1, which we saw earlier is impossible.

Wait another way: if I measure L₁z and L₂z, each can be -ħ, 0, or +ħ. But for the total m to be -1, the sum must be -1. If both are -1, sum is -2, which is not allowed. So the state can't have both m's as -1. So the probability is zero.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is a combination where that's not possible. So the probability of both being -1 is zero.

Looking back at the options, option D is 0. So the answer should be D.
