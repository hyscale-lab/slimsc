Okay, so I've got this question about organic chemistry, specifically about optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, right? Chiral centers are atoms, usually carbons, bonded to four different groups. That makes them non-superimposable on their mirror images, leading to enantiomers which are optically active.

The question has four compounds listed, and I need to figure out which of them can exhibit optical isomerism. Let's go through each one.

1. The first compound is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl rings connected at position 1 and 1', so the substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Wait, the substituents are nitro groups and carboxylate esters. So for each phenyl ring, do the substituents create any chiral centers? No, because the central carbon in the biphenyl structure isn't a carbon, it's a bond between two carbons. Wait, actually, the biphenyl system's central bond is a single bond, which can rotate. So unless there's a chiral center on the rings, like on a substituent, this might not have optical isomerism. Let me think: the substituents are nitro and ester groups. The nitro group is a strong meta director, but in terms of chiral centers, the substituents are on the ring. The rings themselves are connected at the 1 and 1' positions. So each substituent is at 2,6 on each ring. Are any of those positions on the rings leading to chiral centers? Wait, the carboxylic ester is at position 2, which is ortho to the connecting bond. So the substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6. Let's think about each ring. For the ester group at 2: the carbon adjacent could be attached to other groups. Wait, the structure would be OMe attached to the carbonyl group, which is attached to the phenyl ring. So the carbons in the ring are aromatic, not chiral. So the substitution pattern is symmetrical? Wait, no, because the substituents are nitro on 6 and the ester on 2. But is there any possibility of a chiral center in the molecule? Maybe the central bond is single, so the molecule can rotate, but wait, the substituents are in such a way that whether the groups are arranged symmetrically. Hmm, maybe there's a possibility of a chiral center in the biphenyl system if there's an asymmetric arrangement. But I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Or maybe not, depending on substituent positions. Alternatively, if the substituents are on opposite sides, but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe the substituents are in such a way that each ring has two substituents, but each pair are mirror images. Alternatively, perhaps the arrangement is such that the molecule is symmetrical, making it not chiral. Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe this compound doesn't have optical isomerism. Or maybe it does because the biphenyl could be in a non-superimposable mirror image. Wait, wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think of another approach. The molecule is dimethyl ester of a biphenyl with nitro groups and ester groups. The biphenyl is 1,1'-connected, so the substituents are on the 2 and 6 positions. So on each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6. Let me imagine the structure. Each ring has a nitro group at 6 and an ester at 2. Wait, 6 is the para position relative to the connecting bond. So the substituents on each ring are at para positions. So for each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6, which are para to each other. So the substituents are in a symmetrical arrangement, making the molecule symmetrical. So the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Thus, no optical isomerism here. So I'll mark compound 1 as not exhibiting optical isomerism.

2. The second compound is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's see. The structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. Wait, no, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of propanoic acid with the hydroxyl on the second carbon. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOCH2CH2COOH, but as an ester, it's HOCH2CH2COOCH3. Wait, no, wait, propanoate would be CH2CH2COO-; the hydroxyl is on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(COOCH3)(OH)CH3? Wait, wait, wait. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is the ester where the propanoate has a hydroxyl on the middle carbon. So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the second carbon) is attached to: OH, COOCH3, and two CH3 groups? Wait, no: the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the CH(OH)) is connected to CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another CH3? Wait, let me draw it. Carbon chain: CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the middle carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

- One CH3 group (from the left)
- One OH group
- One COOCH3 group (from the right)
- And another CH2 group? Wait, no, wait. No, wait, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the middle carbon is connected to:

- Left: CH3
- Right: COOCH3
- Middle: CH(OH)
Wait, no. The middle carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

- The left CH3 (carbon 1)
- The right COOCH3 (carbon 3)
- The OH group (on carbon 2)
- And the two adjacent carbons: carbon 1 and 3.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Each carbon in a chain has four bonds. So the middle carbon (carbon 2) is connected to:

- Carbon 1 (CH3)
- Carbon 3 (COOCH3)
- OH group
- And another hydrogen?

Wait, wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3? No, wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon. So structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. As an ester, it would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, so the structure is CH3-CH2-COOCH3 with a hydroxyl on the middle CH2. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the middle carbon (the CH2) is connected to:

- Two CH2 groups: the one on the left (CH2OH) and the one on the right (CH2COOCH3)
Wait, no. Let me correct that. The molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is:

CH3(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be:

Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOCH2CH2COOH. As an ester, it's HOCH2CH2COOCH3. So the structure is CH2CH2COOCH3 with a hydroxyl on the middle carbon. So the middle carbon (CH2 group) has:

- One CH2OH group (the hydroxyl is on the second carbon)
- One CH2COOCH3 group
- And two hydrogens.

Wait, no. Let me number the carbons:

Carbon 1: CH3 (from CH2CH2COOCH3)
Carbon 2: CH2 (with OH)
Carbon 3: COOCH3

Wait, no, propanoate has three carbons: the first is the COOCH3, then the second is the CH2, then the third is another CH2. No, wait, perhaps I should think of it as:

The propanoate group is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-OH. Or wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, which would make the central carbon (CH2) attached to:

- One OH group
- Two CH2 groups (one on each side)
Wait, no. Each carbon in the CH2 group would have two CH2 groups and one OH and one COOCH3.

Wait, no. Let me write the structure:

The molecule is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the CH2) is connected to:

- One OH group
- Two CH2 groups (left and right)
- One COOCH3 group.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Each carbon can only have four bonds. So the central CH2 group has:

- Two CH2 groups attached (left and right)
- One OH
- One COOCH3.

Wait, that's four bonds. So the central carbon is attached to:

- CH2OH (the left CH2 group)
- CH2COOCH3 (the right CH2 group)
- OH
- COOCH3?

Wait, no. No, the structure is:

The molecule is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

So the middle carbon (CH2) is connected to:

- The left CH2OH group (which is a CH2 group with an OH)
- The right COOCH3 group (which is a CH2 connected to COOCH3)
- And two hydrogens?

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.

Wait, the correct structure is: the central carbon (carbon 2) is attached to two CH3 groups? No, wait, wait. The molecule is 2-hydroxypropanoate, which is (CH3)2C(OH)COOCH3? No, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH3)CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, that would make sense. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-CHOH-COOH. So as an ester, it's CH3-CHOH-COOCH3.

So the structure is:

       O
       |
CH3-C-O-CO-OCH3?

No, wait, no. The structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3.

So the middle carbon (CHOH) is connected to:

- CH3 (on the left)
- COOCH3 (on the right)
- OH
- And a hydrogen?

Wait, no, because it's 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the central carbon (carbon 2). It's attached to:

- Carbon 1: CH2(OH)
- Carbon 3: CH2COOCH3
- An OH group
- And a hydrogen?

Wait, no. Carbon 2 in CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3 is connected to:

- Two CH2 groups (left and right)
- One OH
- One H.

Wait, that would mean it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, so the central carbon (CH2) has two CH2 groups, an OH, and a H. So the central carbon is CH2, which is:

- Two CH2 groups (left and right)
- One OH
- One H.

Wait, that can't be right because each CH2 group would have two Hs. Maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

The molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the middle carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3 (left)
- COOCH3 (right)
- OH
- And another H.

Wait, that would make the central carbon have four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. So that would make it a chiral center. Because CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H are all different. So that means this molecule has a chiral center and thus exhibits optical isomerism. So compound 2 is optically active.

3. Benzophenone. Structure is (Ph)2CO. Each benzene ring is attached to a ketone group. So the structure is two phenyl groups attached to a carbonyl carbon. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and connected to two phenyl groups. So what about the substituents around the carbonyl carbon? The carbonyl carbon has two phenyl groups, one oxygen (double bond), and a single bond to another group. Wait, no. Benzophenone is (Ph)₂CO. So the carbonyl carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and an oxygen. Wait, the structure is O=C(Ph)₂. So the carbonyl carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and a double bond to oxygen. But wait, in reality, it's a ketone: O=C-Ph₂. So the carbonyl carbon is attached to two phenyl groups, an oxygen (as a double bond), and another phenyl. Wait, no, wait. Benzophenone is diphenyl ketone, so the structure is (C6H5)₂CO. That is, the central carbon is bonded to two phenyl groups, a carbonyl group (O), and another group? Wait, no, no. The structure is:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph

So the carbonyl carbon is bonded to two phenyl groups and an oxygen. No, that's not correct. The carbonyl is a double bond to O, so the central carbon has two phenyl groups attached and a double bond to O. But then, what's the fourth bond? The central carbon is in a ketone group, which is (R)₂CO. So in benzophenone, it's two phenyl groups attached to the carbonyl carbon, which is double-bonded to O. So the structure is O=C(Ph)₂. So the central carbon has a double bond to O and two single bonds to phenyl groups. But that's three bonds. Wait, no, the carbonyl carbon has a double bond to O, and two single bonds to each phenyl group. So in total, the central carbon has three bonds. Wait, that's impossible because a carbon can't have three bonds unless it's something else. Oh wait, no, wait. Benzophenone is a ketone, so the structure is (Ph)₂CO. So the carbonyl group is C=O, and the carbon is connected to two phenyl groups. So the structure is:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph

So the carbonyl carbon is connected to two phenyl groups, the O (double bond), and another group? Wait, that's only three bonds. Oh wait, no, the carbonyl group is C(=O), so the carbon is double-bonded to O and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. So that's three bonds. But carbon needs four bonds. Oh wait, I think I'm getting confused. No, the structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph, which is correct. The central carbon is double-bonded to O (so that's two bonds) and single-bonded to each of the two phenyl groups. So that's four bonds: double bond to O (counts as two), and two single bonds to phenyl. So the central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and a carbonyl group. But that's three substituents. Wait, no, the carbonyl is a substituent. So the central carbon has three substituents: two phenyl and one O (double bond). That doesn't make sense because it would only have three bonds. Wait, maybe I'm misrepresenting the structure. Actually, benzophenone is diphenyl ketone, so the structure is (Ph)₂CO. So the central carbon is bonded to two phenyl groups and a carbonyl oxygen. But I'm not getting this correctly. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of benzophenone as having a carbonyl group with two phenyl substituents. So the structure is O=C(Ph)₂. So the central carbon is bonded to two phenyl groups, one O (as double bond), and another group? No, because O is double bonded, so it's only two groups attached. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The point is, the molecule benzophenone is symmetrical. Each phenyl group is attached to the carbonyl carbon. So looking for any chiral centers: the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O and has two phenyl groups attached. So that's two phenyl groups and an O (double bond). But what about the other substituent? Wait, no, the structure is (Ph)₂CO, which is O=C(Ph)₂. So the central carbon has a double bond to O, and two phenyl groups. So that's three substituents, which can't be right because a carbon must have four bonds. Oh wait, I think I made a mistake. The correct structure is (Ph)₂CO, which is a carbonyl group with two phenyl substituents. So the structure is:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph

So the carbonyl carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and a double bond to O. But that's three bonds. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, no, the structure is correct. The central carbon is bonded to two phenyl groups, one O (double bond), and the other substituent is a lone pair or perhaps a hydrogen? No, no, in ketones, the carbonyl group is R₂CO. So in benzophenone, each R is a phenyl group. So the structure is Ph–C(=O)–Ph. So the central carbon is bonded to two phenyl groups and a double bond O. That's three substituents, but carbon must have four bonds. Wait, this can't be right. Oh! Wait, maybe I'm thinking of the wrong structure. Benzophenone is (Ethenyl)phenyl ketone? No, benzophenone is (Ph)₂CO, so the structure is:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph

So the central carbon is connected to two phenyls, a double bond to O, and... wait, perhaps it's a carbonyl group with two phenyl substituents. Oh wait, perhaps the structure is O=C(Ph)₂, which is correct. So the central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups, a double bond to O, and that's it. But that's only three bonds. Wait, no, the double bond is two bonds, so that's connected to O, and each phenyl is a single bond. So three substituents. Wait, wait, no. Each phenyl is a single bond, so two substituents, plus the double bond (which counts as one substituent). So three substituents. But that's impossible. So I must be getting this wrong. Another approach: the molecular formula of benzophenone is C13H10O. So the structure is two benzene rings connected via a ketone group. So each benzene is connected to a carbonyl carbon, which is also connected to the other benzene. So the carbonyl carbon is attached to two phenyl groups and a ketone oxygen. So the structure is O=C(Ph)₂. So the central carbon is double-bonded to O and single-bonded to two Ph groups. That's three groups, but carbon can't have only three bonds. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a central carbon with two phenyl groups, a carbonyl group, and another substituent, but I'm just not seeing it. Regardless, the key point is whether there's a chiral center. Benzophenone has a symmetrical structure. The two phenyl groups are the same, attached to the carbonyl. So the molecule is symmetrical. Therefore, there's no chiral center. So compound 3 does not exhibit optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the di-ester of maleic acid. The structure of fumarate is (Z)-butenedioic acid. So dimethyl fumarate would be the diester: MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, fumarate is the trans isomer of maleic acid. Wait, maleic acid is the cis isomer, and fumarate is the trans. So the structure of fumarate is HO₂C-CH₂-CH₂-COOH (wait, no, that's maleic acid?) No, wait, maleic acid is HOOC-CH₂-COOH, but that's not correct. Wait, maleic acid is HO₂C-CH₂-CH₂-COOH? No, I'm getting confused. Let me correct: Maleic acid is HO₂CCH₂CH₂CO₂H. But fumaric acid is HO₂CCH₂CH₂CO₂H? No, wait, no. No, wait, maleic acid has the two carboxylic acid groups on adjacent carbons in the cis configuration. Fumaric acid has the same groups but in the trans configuration. So fumarate would be the diester of fumaric acid. So dimethyl fumarate would be MeOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOCH3, but in the trans configuration? Or wait, no. Actually, fumarate is the trans di-ester. Wait, the structure is MeOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOCH3? No, wait, no. I think I'm mixing up the structures. Let me think again. Fumarate is the trans isomer of the diacid. So the structure is HO₂C-CH₂-CH₂-COOH, but that's not correct. Wait, no, the correct structure is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH for maleic acid, and HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH again for fumaric acid? No, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps maleic acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, with the two COOH groups on the same side (cis), and fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH with the COOH groups on opposite sides (trans). So the di-ester, dimethyl fumarate, would be CH₂=CH with each CH₂ connected to COOCH3 groups. So the structure is CH₂=CH with two ester groups: MeOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOCH3? No, wait, no. Wait, the structure of fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid. So the structure is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH, but that's not correct. Wait, no, no. The correct structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the structure of fumarate is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH? No, no, wait. Fumarate is the trans isomer of the diacid. So the structure is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH? No, no, that's incorrect. Let me get this right. Maleic acid is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH with the two COOH groups on adjacent carbons in cis configuration. No, no, wait. No, maleic acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH with the two COOH groups on the same side (cis), and fumaric acid is the trans isomer. So the di-ester, dimethyl fumarate, is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond. So the structure is:

O
||O
O=C-OCH3
   \
    CH₂-CH₂
   /
O=C-OCH3

Wait, no. The actual structure is:

CH₂=CH with each CH₂ connected to a COOCH3 group.

Wait, the structure is CH₂=CH, but each CH is connected to a COOCH3 group. So it's MeOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOCH3? No, that's not correct. Wait, the correct structure is MeOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOCH3, but that's a single bond, which would make it the cis or trans isomer. No, wait, no. Fumarate has a double bond between the two CH groups. So the structure is MeOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOCH3? No, wait, no, it's MeOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOCH3 with a double bond between the CH₂ groups. So it's MeOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOCH3? No, wait, perhaps it's MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. So the structure is:

O
||
O=C-OCH3
   \
    C=CH₂
   /
O=C-OCH3

Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, the structure is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, where the double bond is between the two CH groups, each attached to a COOCH3 group. So in this structure, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond (trans), making it the fumarate form. Now, for optical isomerism, do we have any chiral centers here? Let me think. The molecule has a double bond, which can lead to E and Z isomerism, but in this case, the molecule is trans (fumarate), so it's E. But does this lead to any chiral centers? Wait, no, because each CH in the double bond is connected to two COOCH3 groups and two Hs? No, wait, in the structure MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, each CH is attached to a COOCH3, a hydrogen, and the double bond. So each CH in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups on opposite sides. Wait, no, the structure would be:

O
||
O=C-OCH3 – CH₂ – CH₂ – O=C-OCH3
but that's a single bond. If it's a double bond, the structure would be:

O
||
O=C-OCH3 – CH=CH – O=C-OCH3

But in that case, each CH in the double bond is connected to two OCOOCH3 groups and two Hs. So each CH is CH₂? Wait, no, no. Let me think again. The structure of dimethyl fumarate is:

CH₂=CH with each CH connected to COOCH3 groups. So each CH is attached to two COOCH3 groups and two Hs. Wait, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O=C-OCH3—CH₂—CH₂—O=C-OCH3

But that would be a single bond, which would make it a different compound. Wait, no, fumarate has a double bond. So the correct structure is:

O
||
O=C-OCH3—CH₂—CH₂—O=C-OCH3 (no, that's maleate)
Wait, no, wait. Let me find the correct structure. Fumarate is the trans di-ester of maleic acid. So the structure is CH₂=CH with each CH connected to a COOCH3 group. So:

COOCH3
      \
CH₂=CH
      /
COOCH3

Wait, no, that's not correct. The correct structure is (E)-butenedioic acid's diester. So the structure is:

O
||
O=C-OCH3
     \
      CH₂-CH₂
     /
O=C-OCH3

No, that's incorrect because if it's a double bond, it should be CH₂=CH. So the structure is:

O
||
O=C-OCH3—CH₂—CH₂—O=C-OCH3 (single bond, which is not the case)
But the correct structure for dimethyl fumarate is:

O
||
O=C-OCH3
     \
      CH₂—CH₂
     /
O=C-OCH3

Wait, no, no. I'm getting stuck. Let me think differently. Fumarate is the trans isomer, so the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So if the structure is CH₂=CH with each CH connected to COOCH3, it's:

COOCH3
      \
CH₂=CH
      /
COOCH3

But wait, in reality, it's:

O
||
O=C-OCH3 – CH₂ – CH₂ – O=C-OCH3

No, that would be a single bond. Alternatively, the correct structure is:

HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH is maleic acid? No, that can't be. Wait, maybe I should look up the structure of dimethyl fumarate.

Wait, I think I'm confusing maleic acid and fumaric acid. Maleic acid is the cis diacid: HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. Fumaric acid is the trans diacid: HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH? No, no, that can't be. Wait, no, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH? No, that can't be. Wait, no, wait. Maleic acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH (cis), and fumaric acid is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH? No, I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, it's time to think clearly. The correct structure for fumarate (dimethyl fumarate) is (E)-butenedioic acid's diester. So the structure is:

COOCH3
     \
CH₂=CH
     /
COOCH3

But that would imply each CH is connected to two COOCH3 groups, which isn't possible. So the correct structure is:

CH₂=CH with each CH connected to a COOCH3 group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O=C-OCH3–CH₂–CH₂–O=C-OCH3

But that's a single bond, which is maleate. Fumarate would have a double bond. So the structure would be:

O
||
O=C-OCH3–CH=CH–O=C-OCH3

But that's not possible because each CH would be connected to two COOCH3 groups and a double bond, which would make each CH have three substituents. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O=C-OCH3—CH₂—CH₂—O=C-OCH3 (single bond, which is maleate)
But for fumarate, it's:

O
||
O=C-OCH3—CH=CH—O=C-OCH3

But that would imply each CH is connected to a COOCH3 and another CH, but with a double bond. So the molecule would have a double bond, making it a trans configuration. Now, does this create any chiral centers? Let's look at the central carbons. Each CH in the double bond is connected to:

- One COOCH3 group
- One CH (from the double bond)
- Two Hs.

Wait, no. Each CH in the double bond would have:

- COOCH3 group
- Double bond to the other CH
- Two Hs.

Wait, then each CH would be CH₂, but that doesn't make sense with a double bond. Hmm, perhaps I should think of the structure as:

O
||
O=C-OCH3–CH₂–CH₂–O=C-OCH3 (single bond, which is maleate)
But since fumarate is the trans isomer, it's the diastereomer where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. Wait, but in this case, if it's a double bond, the structure would be:

O
||
O=C-OCH3–CH=CH–O=C-OCH3

But each CH in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 and another CH, and two Hs. So each CH would have:

- COOCH3
- Double bond to the other CH
- Two Hs.

But that would make each CH a CH₂ group, which can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH₂=CH with each CH connected to a COOCH3 group. So each CH is CH₂? No, that can't be because CH₂ with a double bond would have only two substituents. I'm getting stuck here. Let me think differently. The key point is whether dimethyl fumarate has any chiral centers. Since the molecule has a double bond, it's about E/Z isomerism, not optical isomerism. But for optical isomerism, we're looking for chiral centers. So if dimethyl fumarate has any chiral centers, it would exhibit optical isomerism. Let me think about the structure again. If the structure is O=C-OCH3–CH₂–CH₂–O=C-OCH3, which is a single bond, then the molecule is symmetrical, so no chiral centers. But if it's a double bond, then each CH is connected to COOCH3 and H. Wait, no, each CH would have two COOCH3 groups and a double bond. No, that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O=C-OCH3–CH₂–CH₂–O=C-OCH3 (single bond) → No chiral centers.

But dimethyl fumarate is the trans isomer, so the structure must have a double bond. So the structure is:

O
||
O=C-OCH3–CH=CH–O=C-OCH3

But in this case, each CH in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 group and another CH. So each CH is CH₂? No, because with a double bond, each CH can't have two substituents besides the double bond. Wait, perhaps each CH is connected to a COOCH3 group and a hydrogen. So the structure is:

   O
   ||
O=C-OCH3–CH₂–CH₂–O=C-OCH3 (single bond)
But for the trans isomer, it's:

O=C-OCH3–CH₂–CH₂–O=C-OCH3 (trans) → No, that's E or Z isomerism, but no chiral centers.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the possibility of any chiral centers in dimethyl fumarate. If the molecule has a double bond and each CH is symmetric, then no chiral centers. But if the substituents around the double bond are such that it creates a chiral center, perhaps. Wait, no, because the double bond doesn't have a central carbon with four different groups. So perhaps dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, so it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. Wait, but wait, another possibility. Suppose the structure is such that each CH in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 group and two Hs. Then each CH is CH₂, but with a double bond, making it CH₂=CH. So each CH is CH, so each has a CH group. So each CH would be connected to:

- COOCH3
- One H
- Double bond to the other CH.

But that would make each CH have three substituents, which isn't possible. So perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, so it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. Wait, but wait, another angle. Dimethyl fumarate is a di-ester of fumaric acid, which is a trans diacid. The structure is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. Now, looking at the central carbons (the two CH in the double bond), each is connected to:

- One COOCH3 group
- One CH (double bond)
- Two Hs.

So each CH has COOCH3, two Hs, and a double bond. So each CH is CH₂? No, because a double bond requires each CH to have two substituents. Wait, perhaps each CH is CH₂, but that would require more substituents. I'm getting stuck, but I think the key point is that the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers because it's symmetric across the double bond. So dimethyl fumarate doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. Wait, but that can't be right. Because dimethyl fumarate is a di-ester with a double bond. Wait, perhaps it's not. Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a structure where each CH has a COOCH3 group, a H, and two substituents from the double bond. But I'm not getting it right. Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, so it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. Hmm, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps I should think about other possibilities. Another approach: which of the options have chiral centers.

Compound 1: I think it's symmetrical, so no chiral centers.

Compound 2: Has a chiral center, so yes.

Compound 3: Symmetrical, no.

Compound 4: Depends on the structure. If the molecule has a double bond but no chiral centers, then no. But wait, dimethyl fumarate's structure is (E)-butenedioate, which is symmetric, so no chiral centers. So no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So no.

So, which compounds exhibit optical isomerism? Only compound 2.

Wait, but looking back at the options, the options are:

A) 1,2,4 → if 4 does have optical isomerism
B)3,4 → if both don't
C)2,3 → no, because 3 doesn't
D)1,2 → if 1 does, but I think 1 doesn't.

Wait, earlier I thought that compound 1 doesn't have optical isomerism because it's symmetrical. So the only compound that does is compound 2.

But looking at the options, option A includes 2 and 4, but I'm not sure about 4.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 4. Let me think again. If the structure of dimethyl fumarate is MeOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOCH3, which is a single bond, then it's symmetrical, so no chiral centers. But if it's a double bond, then the structure is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. Now, each CH in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 group and a H. So each CH would have:

- COOCH3
- H
- Two substituents from the double bond.

Wait, that would make each CH a CH group, with two substituents (the double bond), a COOCH3, and an H. So each CH has:

- COOCH3
- H
- Two bonds to the adjacent CH (double bond, so one bond each).

Wait, but that can't be right because each CH must have four bonds. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the double bond is between two CH₂ groups, each connected to COOCH3. So the structure is:

MeOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOCH3 → single bond → no optical isomerism.

But that's not fumarate, which has a double bond. So the correct structure must have a double bond, making it:

MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3.

In this structure, each CH in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 group and a H. So each CH has:

- COOCH3 group
- H
- Double bond to the other CH.

Wait, but each CH would only have three substituents: COOCH3, H, and the double bond. That can't be right. So perhaps each CH is connected to a COOCH3, a CH₂ group, and a H. No, this is getting too confusing. Alternatively, maybe the structure of dimethyl fumarate is such that it has a double bond and each CH is connected to a COOCH3 and two Hs. So each CH is CH₂, but that's impossible with a double bond. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a structure where the double bond is between two CH groups, each of which is connected to a COOCH3. So each CH would have:

- COOCH3
- H
- Double bond to the other CH.

Wait, but that would make each CH a CH group, with three substituents: COOCH3, H, and the double bond. But that's not possible. I'm stuck, but I think the key point is that dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers because it's a trans di-ester with a symmetrical structure. Thus, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, among the four compounds, only compound 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) has a chiral center and exhibits optical isomerism.

Wait, but looking back at the options, none of the options have only 2. Let's look at the options again.

Options:
A) 1,2,4 → if 4 does, then 2 and 4 are correct.
B)3,4 → no
C)2,3 → no
D)1,2 → no.

Wait, but I thought 4 doesn't have optical isomerism. So that would mean only 2 is correct. But the options don't have an option with only 2. Let me recheck the question.

Wait, the question says, which of the following compounds show optical isomerism? The options are A) 1,2,4; B)3,4; C)2,3; D)1,2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in analyzing compound 4. Let me think again. Dimethyl fumarate: structure is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. Now, each CH in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 group and a H. So each CH is CH, with substituents: COOCH3, H, and two bonds in the double bond. So each CH has two substituents besides the double bond. Wait, no, each CH is part of the double bond, so they have two substituents: one COOCH3 and one H. So each CH has two substituents and two bonds in the double bond. Wait, that can't be right because each CH must have four bonds. So perhaps I'm wrong about the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a different structure that includes chiral centers.

Wait, another approach: the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, if the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, the molecule might be symmetrical, thus not chiral.

Wait, but if the structure is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the two COOCH3 groups on opposite sides, then each CH is attached to a COOCH3 and a CH group. But that doesn't make a chiral center because each CH is connected to same groups on both sides.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has two chiral centers, but in this case, the substituents are arranged symmetrically, making them not chiral.

Wait, perhaps I should think about another compound, like tartaric acid, which has two chiral centers and exhibits optical isomerism. But in dimethyl fumarate, the substituents are arranged in a way that makes the molecule symmetrical, thus no chiral centers.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Given time constraints, perhaps the correct answer is option A) 1,2,4. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps compound 4 does have optical isomerism.

Wait, another approach: which compounds are capable of optical isomerism? Only those with at least one chiral center. So let's reevaluate each compound.

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate: I think this is symmetrical, so no chiral centers. So no.

2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: has a chiral center, yes.

3. benzophenone: symmetrical, no.

4. dimethyl fumarate: structure is (E)-butenedioate. Each CH is connected to a COOCH3, and perhaps two Hs. So each CH is CH₂? No, that can't be. Wait, perhaps each CH is CH, with substituents: COOCH3, H, and two bonds in the double bond. So each CH has two substituents besides the double bond. So each CH would have:

- COOCH3
- H
- Two bonds in the double bond.

But that's only three substituents, which isn't possible. So perhaps there's a mistake, and dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers.

Thus, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But looking at the options, none of them have only 2. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, looking back at the options, option A includes 1,2,4. But I thought 1 and 4 don't. So perhaps the correct answer is option A is incorrect, and the correct answer is only 2, but that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 1.

Reevaluating compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

The structure is a biphenyl with substituents at 2 and 6 positions on each ring. Each substituent is a nitro group and an ester group (carboxylate).

Wait, the structure is 1,1'-biphenyl, meaning the two phenyl rings are connected at positions 1 and 1'. Then, each ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6. Let me imagine the structure.

Each ring has a nitro group at 6 and an ester group at 2. So on each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6, which are para to each other. So each ring has two substituents that are para. Now, considering the entire molecule, are there any chiral centers? The biphenyl system has a single bond between the two rings, allowing rotation. So the arrangement of substituents can lead to different configurations. However, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it won't be chiral.

Wait, in this case, the substituents on each ring are symmetric. Each ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2. So if the molecule is symmetric, it won't have a chiral center. But if the substituents are arranged in a way that lacks symmetry, then a chiral center could form.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So no optical isomerism.

So, according to this, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But in the options, none of them have only 2. Looking back at the options: the options are A) 1,2,4; B)3,4; C)2,3; D)1,2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 4. Let's think again. Dimethyl fumarate: (E)-butenedioate. So the structure is:

O
||
O=C-OCH3 – CH=CH – O=C-OCH3

But wait, that's not possible because the central structure would require the double bond to be between two carbons each connected to two ester groups. So each CH is connected to two COOCH3 groups? No, that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

COOCH3
     \
CH₂=CH
     /
COOCH3

In this structure, each CH in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 and a CH. So each CH has:

- COOCH3
- CH
- Two Hs.

So each CH has COOCH3, CH, and two Hs. So each CH has four substituents: COOCH3, CH, H, H. Wait, no, that's not possible because the double bond would require one substituent on each CH. Hmm.

Alternatively, each CH is connected to a COOCH3 and a H, and two bonds in the double bond. So each CH has:

- COOCH3
- H
- Two bonds in the double bond.

But that's only three substituents, which isn't possible. So I'm probably getting the structure wrong, but regardless, I think dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, so no optical isomerism.

So, the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is compound 2. But looking at the options, there's no option with only 2. So perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A) 1,2,4, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate compound 1. Could it have a chiral center?

Looking at the structure again: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. The 6 position is para to the connecting bond. So each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So the substituents on each ring are para to each other.

Now, the biphenyl system has a single bond between the two rings, which allows rotation. So the substituents on each ring can be in any configuration. If the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the entire molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it could be chiral.

But in this case, each ring is symmetrical. The substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule as a whole is symmetrical. So the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Thus, no optical isomerism.

So, only compound 2 has a chiral center and exhibits optical isomerism. But in the options, none have only 2. So perhaps the correct answer is option A) 1,2,4, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center. Let me think: If the structure is MeOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOCH3, which is a single bond, then the molecule is symmetrical and has no chiral centers. But if it's a double bond, MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, then each CH is attached to a COOCH3 and a H. So each CH has COOCH3, H, and two substituents from the double bond. But that would make each CH have three substituents, which isn't possible. So perhaps I'm wrong, and dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers.

Thus, the only compound with optical isomerism is 2. But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is option A) 1,2,4, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 4.

Wait, perhaps I should think of another compound. Let me think of meso compounds. A meso compound has multiple chiral centers but is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry. Wait, but dimethyl fumarate isn't a meso compound because it's a di-ester with a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate has no chiral centers, so it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, the correct answer is only compound 2. But the options don't have this. Maybe the options are incorrect, but I have to choose from the given options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 1. Let me think again.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

The structure is a biphenyl with ester groups at 2 and 2' positions, and nitro groups at 6 and 6' positions. So each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are para to each other.

Now, the biphenyl system's central bond is a single bond, allowing rotation. So the substituents can be arranged in such a way that the molecule is not symmetrical.

But if the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center, then the molecule would exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but the biphenyl system itself doesn't have a chiral center; the substituents are on the rings. The rings are connected at position 1 and 1', so the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring.

If the substituents on each ring are arranged such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it could be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral. For example, if the substituents on each ring are mirrored, the molecule would be achiral.

So, without more detailed analysis, I think compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, to conclude, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But the options don't have this. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is option A) 1,2,4, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and compound 4 does exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate has two chiral centers. Let me imagine the structure: MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. Each CH is connected to a COOCH3 and a H, and the double bond. So each CH has three substituents, which can't be right. So perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a structure where each CH is connected to two COOCH3 groups and a double bond. But that would make each CH have three substituents, which is impossible. So I think I'm stuck and must proceed to the conclusion.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of chiral centers (atoms bonded to four different groups). Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has at least one chiral center, leading to non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers).

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of a biphenyl system with substituents at the 2 and 6 positions on each ring. The substituents are a nitro group and a carboxylate ester. The biphenyl system has a single bond between the two rings, allowing rotation. Due to the symmetry of the molecule (substituents are para to each other on each ring), the molecule has a plane of symmetry and is achiral.  
   **Conclusion:** No optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon (CH(OH)) is bonded to four different groups: CH₃, COOCH₃, OH, and H. This makes it a chiral center, and the compound exhibits optical isomerism.  
   **Conclusion:** Exhibits optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   The structure is (Ph)₂C=O, where two phenyl groups are attached to a carbonyl carbon. The molecule is symmetrical, and the carbonyl carbon is not a chiral center because it is double-bonded to oxygen and bonded to two identical phenyl groups.  
   **Conclusion:** No optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   The structure is (E)-butenedioate, with the formula MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The double bond between the two CH groups creates E/Z isomerism, but there are no chiral centers. Each CH in the double bond is bonded to a COOCH₃ group and a hydrogen, making the molecule symmetrical and achiral.  
   **Conclusion:** No optical isomerism.

### Final Answer:
Only compound **2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate)** exhibits optical isomerism. However, none of the provided options include only compound 2. Based on the given options, **A (1, 2, 4)** is the closest match, but compounds 1 and 4 do not exhibit optical isomerism. Despite this inconsistency, **A** is selected as the answer.

**Answer: A**
