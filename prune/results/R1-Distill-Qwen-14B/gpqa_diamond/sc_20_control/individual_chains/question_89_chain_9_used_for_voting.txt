Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let me take it step by step.

The question involves a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure with a lot of bridges, making it quite rigid. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on adjacent bridgehead positions.

First, the compound is heated with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. Since the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, I think this might be an elimination reaction because when vicinal dihalides (two halides on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base, they typically undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. So heating with KOH would likely lead to the elimination of two equivalents of HBr, forming an alkene.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane—if the bromines are on adjacent bridgehead carbons, elimination would form a double bond between those carbons. So the product would be 1,3-adamantadiene? Or maybe it's 1,3-diene in the adamantane structure. But wait, the product is a light yellow solid, which suggests it's an alkene, maybe with some strain because of the adamantane structure.

Looking at the NMR data for product 1: The 1H NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm integrating for 2H. That's a high chemical shift, likely due to an epoxide or an ether. Wait, but if it's elimination, it's more likely to form a double bond. Hmm, maybe I was wrong. Alternatively, the reaction could be a dehydrohalogenation to form a bridged diene, but another possibility is that KOH could cause a substitution.

Wait, no, substitution would require a good leaving group, and KOH is a base. Alternatively, maybe this is a ring-opening of an epoxide. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane is reacting with KOH. Wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but let me think again. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two Br atoms on adjacent bridgehead carbons. Eliminating HBr from each would form a double bond, so the product would be 1,3-adamantadiene or perhaps a ring-contracted structure. But I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, let me check the NMR data again. 4.79 ppm is about where an epoxide's protons would appear, but that's only 2H. Alternatively, it could be an ether. Oh wait, maybe it's not elimination. Another reaction with KOH is dehydrohalogenation with a vicinal dihalide, but in some cases, if the structure is strained, it could form a carbene or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a double elimination leading to a ketone. No, that doesn't fit. Wait, if the starting material is a dihalide, perhaps upon heating with KOH, it undergoes a coupling reaction, but I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution. If KOH is in excess, it might lead to elimination, but perhaps if it's a double substitution? Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the possible product.

Wait, maybe the product is an epoxide. Because if KOH is in a certain condition, maybe it can form an epoxide from a dihalide. But usually epoxides are formed from diols via acid catalysis. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Williamson ether synthesis, but that would require an alkoxide and an alkyl halide. Hmm.

Wait, the IR data shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm-1. That's around the carbonyl region. So maybe the product is a ketone. How? Let's think. If KOH abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to elimination of two HBr molecules, forming a double bond. But then how does that lead to a ketone? Unless the structure rearranges. Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution with something else.

Wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation forming a carbonyl group. Oh! Wait, I think I'm mixing up something. Vicinal dihalides can undergo a double elimination with a strong base to form a ketone. Oh right, that's the haloform reaction, but wait, the haloform reaction is for when you have a methyl group attached to the halide. Alternatively, if the dihalide is in a position where elimination would form a carbonyl, like a vicinal dihalide in a structure where elimination would lead to a carbonyl. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the IR peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 is a ketone. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH could undergo some kind of elimination to form a ketone. How?

Wait, another possibility: the dihalide could undergo a double elimination (like a dehydrohalogenation twice) to form a diene, but that wouldn't lead to a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe a neighboring group participation or some kind of hydride shift.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a bridged bicyclic compound, and upon elimination, a bridge is broken, leading to the formation of a ketone. Let me imagine the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane has a structure where each bridge is a CH2 group. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br on two bridgehead carbons that are across the structure.

If KOH is used, it could abstract a β-hydrogen from each Br, leading to elimination. Each elimination would form a double bond, but since there are two Brs, perhaps two eliminations happen, forming a bridge with a double bond. Alternatively, maybe the two eliminations result in the loss of HBr twice and the formation of a carbonyl group.

Wait, another thought: If the starting material is a bicyclic dihalide, perhaps the elimination of two HBr molecules forms a bridgehead double bond. But then, would that form something else? Alternatively, maybe the base induces a ring contraction.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the product is an epoxide. If product 1's NMR has 2H at 4.79, that's about where epoxide protons are. So, if the product is an epoxide, how would that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH? Wait, epoxide formation usually involves the reaction of an alkoxide with an alkyl halide. But in this case, it's a dihalide. So perhaps an intramolecular epoxide formation?

Wait, another angle. If the initial reaction is elimination, product 1 is an alkene. Then, looking at NMR: 4.79 ppm, 2H. That might correspond to a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, perhaps an epoxide. But wait, how would KOH cause epoxidation? Maybe via some kind of peroxide. Oh wait, but KOH isn't a peroxide. Unless, under certain conditions, it can form some kind of epoxide via an elimination mechanism. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination produces a diene, but that doesn't explain the NMR.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think again about the product's properties. The IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. That suggests a ketone or an ester, but given the reaction conditions, it's more likely a ketone.

So, if product 1 is a ketone, then perhaps the starting dihalide undergoes a double dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl. For example, if the dihalide is in a position where eliminating two HBr molecules would form a carbonyl group.

Wait, but how? Let's imagine the structure. Adamantane has four bridgehead carbons. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br on two bridgeheads. Eliminating two HBr would form a bridge with a double bond. Wait, but to form a carbonyl, perhaps a hydride shift occurs. Alternatively, the dihalide could be on adjacent carbons, and eliminating twice would form a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the reaction forms an enol, which then tautomerizes to a ketone? But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution, but with KOH, substitution would require an SN2 mechanism, but with such a rigid structure, that might not be feasible for bridgehead positions.

Another thought: maybe the dihalide is treated with KOH, leading to a diepoxide? No, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclic ether, but the IR doesn't show a peak for an ether (around 1100-1250 cm-1 for C-O stretch), but maybe that's not the case here because it's a solid.

Wait, the IR of product 1 is at 1720, which is a strong peak, so it's probably a ketone. So perhaps the reaction forms a ketone. How?

Wait, I think I'm getting somewhere. Vicinal dihalides can sometimes undergo dehydrohalogenation twice to form a carbonyl. For example, in some cases, two adjacent X groups can lead to a double elimination, such as in the synthesis of acetone from 2-bromopropane with strong bases. But I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 1,3-dibromo-1-adamantane. So, the two bromines are on the same carbon. Wait, no, the name is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, so they are on different carbons.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a ketone via elimination. Let me think: KOH abstracts a β hydrogen from each Br, leading to the formation of a double bond. But then, how does that form a carbonyl?

Wait, maybe the molecule undergoes a retro-Diels-Alder reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone, but that may require two eliminations.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, leading to a conjugated diene, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here. Let me think about the NMR again. 4.79 ppm is likely an oxygenated CH2 group. For example, in an epoxide, the protons are around 3.5-4.5 ppm. So 4.79 could be an epoxide. But if the product is an epoxide, where is the carbonyl in the IR?

Wait, maybe I was wrong about the IR. 1720 cm-1 is indeed a carbonyl, so product 1 must have a ketone group. So perhaps the initial reaction forms a ketone, and then product 2 is something else.

Wait, perhaps the product 1 is 1,3-diketone adamantane? No, because 1,3-dibromoadamantane would eliminate two HBr to form a di-ketone. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a cyclopropane. But cyclopropane rings don't explain the carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane ring with a ketone group. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dearomatization, but adamantane isn't aromatic.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is not elimination but a substitution. Wait, in a substitution, KOH would replace Br with an O- group. But with two Brs, that would form a di-ether. But then, the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a glycol, but again, that would have an O-H stretch in IR, which isn't mentioned.

Wait, another angle: maybe the process is to form a carbonyl via a double elimination. Let me imagine that each Br is attached to a CH2 group, and when two HBr are eliminated, a double bond forms. But that would require the two Brs to be on adjacent carbons, leading to a double bond.

Wait, but in that case, the product would be an alkene, and the NMR wouldn't show a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. Alternatively, maybe the elimination forms a conjugated diene, which wouldn't have protons at 4.79.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let me think about the next steps.

Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide (Al(i-Pr)3) is commonly used as a Lewis acid catalyst, especially in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But wait, product 1 is a ketone, so perhaps product 2 is the result of Friedel-Crafts acylation. But wait, the starting material for product 2 is product 1, which is a ketone. So, perhaps product 2 is a more substituted ketone, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diene, and reacting with Al(i-Pr)3 could lead to some kind of cycloaddition or other reaction, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps Al(i-Pr)3 is used in the formation of an enol ether or some kind of acetylation. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and Al(i-Pr)3 is used in a ring-opening reaction. But without knowing product 1, it's hard to say.

Moving on, product 3 is formed by ozonolysis of product 2 at -78°C, followed by addition of dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl compounds. But wait, ozonolysis is usually done at low temperatures, like -78°C, using reductive workup (like dimethyl sulfide) which would break the ozonides into aldehydes or ketones, depending on the substituents.

So, if product 2 has a double bond, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was. Now, the question is about the NMR of product 3, specifically the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, excluding those that exchange with the solvent.

The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, pentet.

So, the most deshielded hydrogen would likely be near an electronegative group, like a carbonyl. In product 3, after ozonolysis, the carbonyl groups would be present, so any protons adjacent to them would be deshielded.

Now, considering the structure after ozonolysis, the most deshielded proton would probably be on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. Let's think about the coupling.

In a typical ozonolysis, a symmetrical double bond would lead to two identical carbonyl compounds. But if the double bond is in a ring, like in a cyclic structure, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups, possibly forming two ketones or a ketone and an aldehyde, depending on substitution.

Wait, let's try to reconstruct the possible structures.

Product 1: Let's assume it's a ketone. So, product 1 is 1,3-diketone adamantane? No, because the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclopropane derivative with a ketone. But not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the overall process again.

1,3-dibromoadamantane → (KOH, heat) → product 1 (light yellow solid, IR 1720 cm-1 → ketone). Then product 1 is treated with Al(i-Pr)3 → product 2. Then product 2 undergoes ozonolysis → product 3.

If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether or some kind of acetylated product. Alternatively, maybe product 2 is a cyclopropane ketone. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the initial product (product 1) has an NMR with peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Let me try to interpret that.

The 4.79 ppm is 2H, likely a CH2 group attached to something deshielding, maybe oxygen. The 2.41-2.23 region is 10H; that's a lot of hydrogens. Perhaps it's a methyl group in a rigid structure, like adamantane. The 1.94 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 group adjacent to something.

Wait, if product 1 is a di-substituted cyclopropane with a ketone, perhaps the structure has a CH2 group attached to a cyclopropane ring, which is attached to a ketone.

Alternatively, product 1 could be a ketone with an adjacent CH2-O group. Let's say it's (CH2)2O attached to the adamantane structure, but that doesn't explain the 1720 cm-1 peak.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a cyclopropane ring with a ketone. For example, a cyclopropane ring where one carbon is a ketone. So, the structure would have a ketone (O=C-), and adjacent CH2 groups.

Wait, but then the NMR would have a peak around 2.4-2.23 for CH2 groups near the ketone, which is possible. The 1.94 ppm could be from another CH2 group.

Alternatively, product 1 could be a bridged bicyclic ketone. For example, in a norbornene-like structure, elimination could form a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the structure of product 1 is a norbornene derivative with a ketone group. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a tricyclic compound with a ketone. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to proceed.

Let me think about the next step. Product 1 is treated with Al(i-Pr)3 to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, so perhaps it's used in Friedel-Crafts acylation or alkylation. But product 1 is a ketone, so maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation, introducing an acylium ion.

Wait, but product 1 is already a ketone. Hmm. Alternatively, Al(i-Pr)3 could be used in a ring-opening reaction, if product 1 is an epoxide. If product 1 is an epoxide, then Al(i-Pr)3 could protonate the epoxide, leading to ring opening. But without knowing product 1's structure, it's challenging.

Moving on to ozonolysis. If product 2 has a double bond, then ozonolysis would cleave it. The resulting product 3 would have carbonyl groups. The most deshielded proton in product 3 would be adjacent to a carbonyl group.

In the NMR of product 3, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H is the question. So, if the H is on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, it's possible that each H on the CH2 would couple with neighboring Hs.

Wait, for a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, each H would be split by adjacent Hs. If it's a CH2 group, each H would have two neighboring Hs on the same carbon (geminal), but geminal coupling is usually not observed in 1H NMR because they are equivalent. However, if the CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 group, then each H would couple with the neighboring Hs.

Wait, let's imagine that product 3 has a structure like (CH2)2O or something similar, but more likely, after ozonolysis, it's two carbonyls connected by something.

Wait, for example, if product 2 is a diene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. Suppose product 2 has a double bond in a position such that after ozonolysis, each end becomes a carbonyl group. Then, the resulting product 3 would have two carbonyl groups connected by some structure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a cyclic diene, and ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups, forming a diepoxide or something else. But I'm not certain.

Wait, considering the options for the coupling pattern: triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, pentet.

If the most deshielded H is on a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2 group, which is adjacent to a carbonyl, the coupling would involve neighboring Hs.

Let me imagine a structure where the H is on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. Each H on the CH2 would couple with Hs on adjacent carbons. If the adjacent group is another CH2, each H would see two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. But if the adjacent group has more Hs, the splitting could be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is on a CH2 group that's next to another CH2 group, which is next to another CH2 group. Then, each H would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH2, resulting in a triplet. But if there's another coupling partner further away, it could lead to a doublet of triplets or similar.

Wait, another scenario: if the H is on a CH2 group adjacent to a CH group (like CH2-CH2-C=O), then each H would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. But if that CH2 is next to another CH2, which is next to another group, the coupling could be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is on a CH2 group that's adjacent to a CH2 group, which is adjacent to a CH group. So each H would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH2, and perhaps also with Hs on the CH group, leading to more splitting.

Wait, let's think about the number of neighboring Hs.

If the most deshielded H is on a CH2 group, and this CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 group, each H on the first CH2 would see two Hs on the adjacent CH2. That would cause each H to split into a triplet. However, if the adjacent CH2 is also adjacent to another group, perhaps another CH2, then each H would also couple with Hs from that group, leading to more splitting.

Alternatively, if the H is on a CH2 group that's between two CH2 groups (like CH2-CH2-CH2-C=O), then each H on the middle CH2 would see two Hs on each adjacent CH2. That would lead to a triplet of triplets, because each H is coupled with two Hs on each side.

Wait, no. Let me think again. For a proton in a CH2 group that is between two CH2 groups, each H would have two neighboring Hs on each side. So each H would couple with two Hs on the left and two Hs on the right, leading to a splitting pattern of (2+1)*(2+1) = 9, which is a nonet. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is on a CH2 group that is next to a CH group, leading to a coupling with that CH's H. So, if the structure is CH2-CH2-C=O, the middle CH2's H would each couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2 (left) and with the H on the CH (right). So each H would be split into a triplet (from left CH2) and a doublet (from right CH), leading to a triplet of triplets (or a doublet of triplets, depending on the order).

Wait, but the options include triplet of triplets (option B), doublet of triplets (option C), etc.

Alternatively, maybe the H is on a CH2 group next to a CH group, which is next to another CH2 group. So each H would couple with two Hs from the adjacent CH2 and one H from the CH group, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely confident. Let's try to imagine a specific structure.

Suppose product 3 is a diketone, like O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. Then, the CH2 groups in the middle would each have two Hs. Each H on the central CH2 would be next to two Hs on each adjacent CH2. Wait, but that would be a situation where each H has two neighboring Hs on each side, leading to more complex splitting.

Wait, but the most deshielded H would be on a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl. Let's say the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-C=O. Then, the middle CH2 would have Hs that are next to two Hs on the adjacent CH2 groups on either side. Each H would couple with two Hs on each side, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, then each CH2 group's Hs would see two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but in that case, the Hs on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be a triplet because they couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH2. For example, (CH2)2-C=O. The Hs on the first CH2 (next to the carbonyl) would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

But if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-C=O, then the middle CH2's Hs would be coupled with two Hs on each side, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-C=O, then the CH2 group's Hs would couple with the adjacent CH group (which has one H) and the other CH2. Hmm, but that might lead to a doublet of triplets.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the coupling in the most deshielded H. The most deshielded would be on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. Let's imagine the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-X, where X is another group. The Hs on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be split by the adjacent CH2 group.

Each H on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would see two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So each H would have a triplet. But if the adjacent CH2 is also coupled with another group, perhaps that would add more splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the adjacent group is a CH, leading to coupling with one H, making each H a doublet. Then, if each H is also coupled with two Hs from another group, it would become a triplet of doublets or vice versa.

Wait, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-C=O. Each CH2 group has two Hs. The Hs on the middle CH2 would be coupled with two Hs on each adjacent CH2. So each H would have (2+1)*(2+1) = 9 peaks, which is a nonet. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, so the Hs on the CH2 next to the carbonyl are each coupled with two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

In that case, the coupling pattern would be a triplet, which is option A.

Wait, but the question specifies the most deshielded H. If the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, the Hs on the CH2 next to the carbonyl are more deshielded than those further away. So those Hs would appear upfield or downfield? Electronegative groups deshield Hs, so the Hs next to the carbonyl would be more deshielded (downfield shifted), making them the most deshielded.

So, each of those Hs is on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. Each H would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH2 group, leading to a triplet.

But wait, there's another possibility. If the adjacent group is a CH2 which is also adjacent to another CH2, the coupling could involve more Hs. For example, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-C=O, then the Hs on the first CH2 would couple with two Hs on the next CH2, leading to a triplet. But the middle CH2's Hs would couple with two Hs on each side, leading to more splitting.

But the question is about the most deshielded H, which would be on the CH2 next to the carbonyl. So in the O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O structure, the Hs on the first CH2 would be the most deshielded and show a triplet.

So the answer would be triplet, option A.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Maybe I should think about the reaction steps again.

Product 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (light yellow solid, IR 1720 cm-1, NMR shows 2H at 4.79, probably an OCH2 group? Or a ketone group with adjacent CH2.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ether. If KOH caused an epoxide formation, then product 1 would be an epoxide. The IR would then show C-O stretching, which is around 1100-1250 cm-1. But the given IR is at 1720, which is more consistent with a carbonyl, so maybe product 1 is a ketone.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a ketone formed via elimination. For example, 1,3-dibromoadamantane → upon elimination, forms a ketone, like 1,3-diketone adamantane. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is adamantane-1,3-dione. So, the structure would have two ketone groups on adjacent bridgehead positions. Then, product 1's NMR would have peaks from the bridgehead CH groups, but I'm not sure.

But the NMR data shows 4.79 ppm (2H), which is a CH2 group. If product 1 is a diketone, perhaps the structure is such that there's a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclopropane ring with a carbonyl group. For example, a cyclopropane ring where one carbon is a ketone. Then, the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyl would have Hs around 4.79 ppm. But cyclopropane rings are strained, and the Hs would be deshielded, possibly appearing downfield.

Wait, if product 1 is a cyclopropanone derivative, then the NMR would show the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyl. The Hs on those CH2 groups would be around 4.79 ppm, which fits the data. The IR would show the ketone peak at 1720 cm-1, which also fits.

Then, when product 1 is treated with Al(i-Pr)3, perhaps it undergoes some kind of ring-opening or acylation. But I'm not entirely sure.

Moving on, product 2 is formed, and then ozonolysis is performed. If product 2 contains a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into carbonyl groups.

Assuming product 2 has a cyclopropane ring with a double bond, ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups, forming product 3 with two ketones.

The most deshielded H in product 3 would be adjacent to a carbonyl. Let's say the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. The Hs on the CH2 groups next to the carbonyls would be the most deshielded.

Each H on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. So the coupling pattern would be a triplet, option A.

But wait, another possibility: if the H is on a CH2 group that's next to a CH group, which is next to another CH2 group, the coupling could be more complex. For example, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-C=O, then the Hs on the CH2 would couple with the CH group's H and the adjacent CH2's Hs. That could lead to a doublet of triplets or a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-C=O, the middle CH2's Hs would have more splitting, but the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be a triplet.

I think the most straightforward scenario is that the Hs are on a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl, coupled with two Hs from the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. Hence, the answer would be A) triplet.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Upon heating with excess KOH, the product (product 1) is identified as a ketone based on the IR spectrum showing a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carbonyl group. The NMR data for product 1 includes a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), likely corresponding to a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl, and other peaks consistent with the adamantane framework.

Product 1 is then treated with aluminum isopropoxide (Al(i-Pr)₃), a Lewis acid, to form product 2. While the exact structure of product 2 is not explicitly determined, it is assumed to contain a double bond, as ozonolysis in the next step cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups.

In the final step, product 2 undergoes ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by a reductive workup with dimethyl sulfide, forming product 3. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, and the resulting product 3 contains carbonyl groups. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl group. This hydrogen is part of a CH₂ group, and its coupling pattern is determined by the neighboring hydrogens.

If the structure of product 3 is O=C-CH₂-CH₂-C=O, the CH₂ group adjacent to the carbonyl is coupled with the two hydrogens on the adjacent CH₂ group, resulting in a triplet splitting pattern. This matches the description of the most deshielded hydrogen in the NMR spectrum of product 3.

Thus, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet**.

Answer: A

Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let me take it step by step.

The question involves a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure with a lot of bridges, making it quite rigid. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on adjacent bridgehead positions.

First, the compound is heated with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. Since the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, I think this might be an elimination reaction because when vicinal dihalides (two halides on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base, they typically undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. So heating with KOH would likely lead to the elimination of two equivalents of HBr, forming an alkene.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane—if the bromines are on adjacent bridgehead carbons, elimination would form a double bond between those carbons. So the product would be 1,3-adamantadiene? Or maybe it's 1,3-diene in the adamantane structure. But wait, the product is a light yellow solid, which suggests it's an alkene, maybe with some strain because of the adamantane structure.

Looking at the NMR data for product 1: The 1H NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm integrating for 2H. That's a high chemical shift, likely due to an epoxide or an ether. Wait, but if it's elimination, it's more likely to form a double bond. Hmm, maybe I was wrong. Alternatively, the reaction could be a dehydrohalogenation to form a bridged diene, but another possibility is that KOH could cause a substitution.

Wait, no, substitution would require a good leaving group, and KOH is a base. Alternatively, maybe this is a ring-opening of an epoxide. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane is reacting with KOH. Wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but let me think again. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two Br atoms on adjacent bridgehead carbons. Eliminating HBr from each would form a double bond, so the product would be 1,3-adamantadiene or perhaps a ring-contracted structure. But I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, let me check the NMR data again. 4.79 ppm is about where an epoxide's protons would appear, but that's only 2H. Alternatively, it could be an ether. Oh wait, maybe it's not elimination. Another reaction with KOH is dehydrohalogenation with a vicinal dihalide, but in some cases, if the structure is strained, it could form a carbene or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a double elimination leading to a ketone. No, that doesn't fit. Wait, if the starting material is a dihalide, perhaps upon heating with KOH, it undergoes a coupling reaction, but I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution. If KOH is in excess, it might lead to elimination, but perhaps if it's a double substitution? Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the possible product.

Wait, maybe the product is an epoxide. Because if KOH is in a certain condition, maybe it can form an epoxide from a dihalide. But usually epoxides are formed from diols via acid catalysis. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Williamson ether synthesis, but that would require an alkoxide and an alkyl halide. Hmm.

Wait, the IR data shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm-1. That's around the carbonyl region. So maybe the product is a ketone. How? Let's think. If KOH abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to elimination of two HBr molecules, forming a double bond. But then how does that lead to a ketone? Unless the structure rearranges. Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution with something else.

Wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation forming a carbonyl group. Oh! Wait, I think I'm mixing up something. Vicinal dihalides can undergo a double elimination with a strong base to form a ketone. Oh right, that's the haloform reaction, but wait, the haloform reaction is for when you have a methyl group attached to the halide. Alternatively, if the dihalide is in a position where elimination would form a carbonyl, like a vicinal dihalide in a structure where elimination would lead to a carbonyl. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the IR peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 is a ketone. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH could undergo some kind of elimination to form a ketone. How?

Wait, another possibility: the dihalide could undergo a double elimination (like a dehydrohalogenation twice) to form a diene, but that wouldn't lead to a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe a neighboring group participation or some kind of hydride shift.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a bridged bicyclic compound, and upon elimination, a bridge is broken, leading to the formation of a ketone. Let me imagine the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane has a structure where each bridge is a CH2 group. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br on two bridgehead carbons that are across the structure.

If KOH is used, it could abstract a β-hydrogen from each Br, leading to elimination. Each elimination would form a double bond, but since there are two Brs, perhaps two eliminations happen, forming a bridge with a double bond. Alternatively, maybe the two eliminations result in the loss of HBr twice and the formation of a carbonyl group.

Wait, another thought: If the starting material is a bicyclic dihalide, perhaps the elimination of two HBr molecules forms a bridgehead double bond. But then, would that form something else? Alternatively, maybe the base induces a ring contraction.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the product is an epoxide. If product 1's NMR has 2H at 4.79, that's about where epoxide protons are. So, if the product is an epoxide, how would that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH? Wait, epoxide formation usually involves the reaction of an alkoxide with an alkyl halide. But in this case, it's a dihalide. So perhaps an intramolecular epoxide formation?

Wait, another angle. If the initial reaction is elimination, product 1 is an alkene. Then, looking at NMR: 4.79 ppm, 2H. That might correspond to a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, perhaps an epoxide. But wait, how would KOH cause epoxidation? Maybe via some kind of peroxide. Oh wait, but KOH isn't a peroxide. Unless, under certain conditions, it can form some kind of epoxide via an elimination mechanism. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination produces a diene, but that doesn't explain the NMR.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think again about the product's properties. The IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. That suggests a ketone or an ester, but given the reaction conditions, it's more likely a ketone.

So, if product 1 is a ketone, then perhaps the starting dihalide undergoes a double dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl. For example, if the dihalide is in a position where eliminating two HBr molecules would form a carbonyl group.

Wait, but how? Let's imagine the structure. Adamantane has four bridgehead carbons. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br on two bridgeheads. Eliminating two HBr would form a bridge with a double bond. Wait, but to form a carbonyl, perhaps a hydride shift occurs. Alternatively, the dihalide could be on adjacent carbons, and eliminating twice would form a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the reaction forms an enol, which then tautomerizes to a ketone? But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution, but with KOH, substitution would require an SN2 mechanism, but with such a rigid structure, that might not be feasible for bridgehead positions.

Another thought: maybe the dihalide is treated with KOH, leading to a diepoxide? No, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclic ether, but the IR doesn't show a peak for an ether (around 1100-1250 cm-1 for C-O stretch), but maybe that's not the case here because it's a solid.

Wait, the IR of product 1 is at 1720, which is a strong peak, so it's probably a ketone. So perhaps the reaction forms a ketone. How?

Wait, I think I'm getting somewhere. Vicinal dihalides can sometimes undergo dehydrohalogenation twice to form a carbonyl. For example, in some cases, two adjacent X groups can lead to a double elimination, such as in the synthesis of acetone from 2-bromopropane with strong bases. But I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 1,3-dibromo-1-adamantane. So, the two bromines are on the same carbon. Wait, no, the name is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, so they are on different carbons.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a ketone via elimination. Let me think: KOH abstracts a β hydrogen from each Br, leading to the formation of a double bond. But then, how does that form a carbonyl?

Wait, maybe the molecule undergoes a retro-Diels-Alder reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone, but that may require two eliminations.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, leading to a conjugated diene, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here. Let me think about the NMR again. 4.79 ppm is likely an oxygenated CH2 group. For example, in an epoxide, the protons are around 3.5-4.5 ppm. So 4.79 could be an epoxide. But if the product is an epoxide, where is the carbonyl in the IR?

Wait, maybe I was wrong about the IR. 1720 cm-1 is indeed a carbonyl, so product 1 must have a ketone group. So perhaps the initial reaction forms a ketone, and then product 2 is something else.

Wait, perhaps the product 1 is 1,3-diketone adamantane? No, because 1,3-dibromoadamantane would eliminate two HBr to form a di-ketone. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a cyclopropane. But cyclopropane rings don't explain the carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane ring with a ketone group. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dearomatization, but adamantane isn't aromatic.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is not elimination but a substitution. Wait, in a substitution, KOH would replace Br with an O- group. But with two Brs, that would form a di-ether. But then, the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a glycol, but again, that would have an O-H stretch in IR, which isn't mentioned.

Wait, another angle: maybe the process is to form a carbonyl via a double elimination. Let me imagine that each Br is attached to a CH2 group, and when two HBr are eliminated, a double bond forms. But that would require the two Brs to be on adjacent carbons, leading to a double bond.

Wait, but in that case, the product would be an alkene, and the NMR wouldn't show a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. Alternatively, maybe the elimination forms a conjugated diene, which wouldn't have protons at 4.79.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let me think about the next steps.

Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide (Al(i-Pr)3) is commonly used as a Lewis acid catalyst, especially in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But wait, product 1 is a ketone, so perhaps product 2 is the result of Friedel-Crafts acylation. But wait, the starting material for product 2 is product 1, which is a ketone. So, perhaps product 2 is a more substituted ketone, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diene, and reacting with Al(i-Pr)3 could lead to some kind of cycloaddition or other reaction, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps Al(i-Pr)3 is used in the formation of an enol ether or some kind of acetylation. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and Al(i-Pr)3 is used in a ring-opening reaction. But without knowing product 1, it's hard to say.

Moving on, product 3 is formed by ozonolysis of product 2 at -78°C, followed by addition of dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl compounds. But wait, ozonolysis is usually done at low temperatures, like -78°C, using reductive workup (like dimethyl sulfide) which would break the ozonides into aldehydes or ketones, depending on the substituents.

So, if product 2 has a double bond, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was. Now, the question is about the NMR of product 3, specifically the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, excluding those that exchange with the solvent.

The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, pentet.

So, the most deshielded hydrogen would likely be near an electronegative group, like a carbonyl. In product 3, after ozonolysis, the carbonyl groups would be present, so any protons adjacent to them would be deshielded.

Now, considering the structure after ozonolysis, the most deshielded proton would probably be on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. Let's think about the coupling.

In a typical ozonolysis, a symmetrical double bond would lead to two identical carbonyl compounds. But if the double bond is in a ring, like in a cyclic structure, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups, possibly forming two ketones or a ketone and an aldehyde, depending on substitution.

Wait, let's try to reconstruct the possible structures.

Product 1: Let's assume it's a ketone. So, product 1 is 1,3-diketone adamantane? No, because the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclopropane derivative with a ketone. But not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the overall process again.

1,3-dibromoadamantane → (KOH, heat) → product 1 (light yellow solid, IR 1720 cm-1 → ketone). Then product 1 is treated with Al(i-Pr)3 → product 2. Then product 2 undergoes ozonolysis → product 3.

If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether or some kind of acetylated product. Alternatively, maybe product 2 is a cyclopropane ketone. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the initial product (product 1) has an NMR with peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Let me try to interpret that.

The 4.79 ppm is 2H, likely a CH2 group attached to something deshielding, maybe oxygen. The 2.41-2.23 region is 10H; that's a lot of hydrogens. Perhaps it's a methyl group in a rigid structure, like adamantane. The 1.94 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 group adjacent to something.

Wait, if product 1 is a di-substituted cyclopropane with a ketone, perhaps the structure has a CH2 group attached to a cyclopropane ring, which is attached to a ketone.

Alternatively, product 1 could be a ketone with an adjacent CH2-O group. Let's say it's (CH2)2O attached to the adamantane structure, but that doesn't explain the 1720 cm-1 peak.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a cyclopropane ring with a ketone. For example, a cyclopropane ring where one carbon is a ketone. So, the structure would have a ketone (O=C-), and adjacent CH2 groups.

Wait, but then the NMR would have a peak around 2.4-2.23 for CH2 groups near the ketone, which is possible. The 1.94 ppm could be from another CH2 group.

Alternatively, product 1 could be a bridged bicyclic ketone. For example, in a norbornene-like structure, elimination could form a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the structure of product 1 is a norbornene derivative with a ketone group. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a tricyclic compound with a ketone. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to proceed.

Let me think about the next step. Product 1 is treated with Al(i-Pr)3 to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, so perhaps it's used in Friedel-Crafts acylation or alkylation. But product 1 is a ketone, so maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation, introducing an acylium ion.

Wait, but product 1 is already a ketone. Hmm. Alternatively, Al(i-Pr)3 could be used in a ring-opening reaction, if product 1 is an epoxide. If product 1 is an epoxide, then Al(i-Pr)3 could protonate the epoxide, leading to ring opening. But without knowing product 1's structure, it's challenging.

Moving on to ozonolysis. If product 2 has a double bond, then ozonolysis would cleave it. The resulting product 3 would have carbonyl groups. The most deshielded proton in product 3 would be adjacent to a carbonyl group.

In the NMR of product 3, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H is the question. So, if the H is on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, it's possible that each H on the CH2 would couple with neighboring Hs.

Wait, for a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, each H would be split by adjacent Hs. If it's a CH2 group, each H would have two neighboring Hs on the same carbon (geminal), but geminal coupling is usually not observed in 1H NMR because they are equivalent. However, if the CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 group, then each H would couple with the neighboring Hs.

Wait, let's imagine that product 3 has a structure like (CH2)2O or something similar, but more likely, after ozonolysis, it's two carbonyls connected by something.

Wait, for example, if product 2 is a diene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. Suppose product 2 has a double bond in a position such that after ozonolysis, each end becomes a carbonyl group. Then, the resulting product 3 would have two carbonyl groups connected by some structure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a cyclic diene, and ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups, forming a diepoxide or something else. But I'm not certain.

Wait, considering the options for the coupling pattern: triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, pentet.

If the most deshielded H is on a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2 group, which is adjacent to a carbonyl, the coupling would involve neighboring Hs.

Let me imagine a structure where the H is on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. Each H on the CH2 would couple with Hs on adjacent carbons. If the adjacent group is another CH2, each H would see two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. But if the adjacent group has more Hs, the splitting could be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is on a CH2 group that's next to another CH2 group, which is next to another CH2 group. Then, each H would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH2, resulting in a triplet. But if there's another coupling partner further away, it could lead to a doublet of triplets or similar.

Wait, another scenario: if the H is on a CH2 group adjacent to a CH group (like CH2-CH2-C=O), then each H would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. But if that CH2 is next to another CH2, which is next to another group, the coupling could be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is on a CH2 group that's adjacent to a CH2 group, which is adjacent to a CH group. So each H would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH2, and perhaps also with Hs on the CH group, leading to more splitting.

Wait, let's think about the number of neighboring Hs.

If the most deshielded H is on a CH2 group, and this CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 group, each H on the first CH2 would see two Hs on the adjacent CH2. That would cause each H to split into a triplet. However, if the adjacent CH2 is also adjacent to another group, perhaps another CH2, then each H would also couple with Hs from that group, leading to more splitting.

Alternatively, if the H is on a CH2 group that's between two CH2 groups (like CH2-CH2-CH2-C=O), then each H on the middle CH2 would see two Hs on each adjacent CH2. That would lead to a triplet of triplets, because each H is coupled with two Hs on each side.

Wait, no. Let me think again. For a proton in a CH2 group that is between two CH2 groups, each H would have two neighboring Hs on each side. So each H would couple with two Hs on the left and two Hs on the right, leading to a splitting pattern of (2+1)*(2+1) = 9, which is a nonet. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is on a CH2 group that is next to a CH group, leading to a coupling with that CH's H. So, if the structure is CH2-CH2-C=O, the middle CH2's H would each couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2 (left) and with the H on the CH (right). So each H would be split into a triplet (from left CH2) and a doublet (from right CH), leading to a triplet of triplets (or a doublet of triplets, depending on the order).

Wait, but the options include triplet of triplets (option B), doublet of triplets (option C), etc.

Alternatively, maybe the H is on a CH2 group next to a CH group, which is next to another CH2 group. So each H would couple with two Hs from the adjacent CH2 and one H from the CH group, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely confident. Let's try to imagine a specific structure.

Suppose product 3 is a diketone, like O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. Then, the CH2 groups in the middle would each have two Hs. Each H on the central CH2 would be next to two Hs on each adjacent CH2. Wait, but that would be a situation where each H has two neighboring Hs on each side, leading to more complex splitting.

Wait, but the most deshielded H would be on a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl. Let's say the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-C=O. Then, the middle CH2 would have Hs that are next to two Hs on the adjacent CH2 groups on either side. Each H would couple with two Hs on each side, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, then each CH2 group's Hs would see two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but in that case, the Hs on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be a triplet because they couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH2. For example, (CH2)2-C=O. The Hs on the first CH2 (next to the carbonyl) would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

But if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-C=O, then the middle CH2's Hs would be coupled with two Hs on each side, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-C=O, then the CH2 group's Hs would couple with the adjacent CH group (which has one H) and the other CH2. Hmm, but that might lead to a doublet of triplets.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the coupling in the most deshielded H. The most deshielded would be on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. Let's imagine the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-X, where X is another group. The Hs on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be split by the adjacent CH2 group.

Each H on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would see two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So each H would have a triplet. But if the adjacent CH2 is also coupled with another group, perhaps that would add more splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the adjacent group is a CH, leading to coupling with one H, making each H a doublet. Then, if each H is also coupled with two Hs from another group, it would become a triplet of doublets or vice versa.

Wait, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-C=O. Each CH2 group has two Hs. The Hs on the middle CH2 would be coupled with two Hs on each adjacent CH2. So each H would have (2+1)*(2+1) = 9 peaks, which is a nonet. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, so the Hs on the CH2 next to the carbonyl are each coupled with two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

In that case, the coupling pattern would be a triplet, which is option A.

Wait, but the question specifies the most deshielded H. If the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, the Hs on the CH2 next to the carbonyl are more deshielded than those further away. So those Hs would appear upfield or downfield? Electronegative groups deshield Hs, so the Hs next to the carbonyl would be more deshielded (downfield shifted), making them the most deshielded.

So, each of those Hs is on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. Each H would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH2 group, leading to a triplet.

But wait, there's another possibility. If the adjacent group is a CH2 which is also adjacent to another CH2, the coupling could involve more Hs. For example, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-C=O, then the Hs on the first CH2 would couple with two Hs on the next CH2, leading to a triplet. But the middle CH2's Hs would couple with two Hs on each side, leading to more splitting.

But the question is about the most deshielded H, which would be on the CH2 next to the carbonyl. So in the O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O structure, the Hs on the first CH2 would be the most deshielded and show a triplet.

So the answer would be triplet, option A.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Maybe I should think about the reaction steps again.

Product 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (light yellow solid, IR 1720 cm-1, NMR shows 2H at 4.79, probably an OCH2 group? Or a ketone group with adjacent CH2.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ether. If KOH caused an epoxide formation, then product 1 would be an epoxide. The IR would then show C-O stretching, which is around 1100-1250 cm-1. But the given IR is at 1720, which is more consistent with a carbonyl, so maybe product 1 is a ketone.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a ketone formed via elimination. For example, 1,3-dibromoadamantane → upon elimination, forms a ketone, like 1,3-diketone adamantane. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is adamantane-1,3-dione. So, the structure would have two ketone groups on adjacent bridgehead positions. Then, product 1's NMR would have peaks from the bridgehead CH groups, but I'm not sure.

But the NMR data shows 4.79 ppm (2H), which is a CH2 group. If product 1 is a diketone, perhaps the structure is such that there's a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclopropane ring with a carbonyl group. For example, a cyclopropane ring where one carbon is a ketone. Then, the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyl would have Hs around 4.79 ppm. But cyclopropane rings are strained, and the Hs would be deshielded, possibly appearing downfield.

Wait, if product 1 is a cyclopropanone derivative, then the NMR would show the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyl. The Hs on those CH2 groups would be around 4.79 ppm, which fits the data. The IR would show the ketone peak at 1720 cm-1, which also fits.

Then, when product 1 is treated with Al(i-Pr)3, perhaps it undergoes some kind of ring-opening or acylation. But I'm not entirely sure.

Moving on, product 2 is formed, and then ozonolysis is performed. If product 2 contains a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into carbonyl groups.

Assuming product 2 has a cyclopropane ring with a double bond, ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups, forming product 3 with two ketones.

The most deshielded H in product 3 would be adjacent to a carbonyl. Let's say the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. The Hs on the CH2 groups next to the carbonyls would be the most deshielded.

Each H on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. So the coupling pattern would be a triplet, option A.

But wait, another possibility: if the H is on a CH2 group that's next to a CH group, which is next to another CH2 group, the coupling could be more complex. For example, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-C=O, then the Hs on the CH2 would couple with the CH group's H and the adjacent CH2's Hs. That could lead to a doublet of triplets or a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-C=O, the middle CH2's Hs would have more splitting, but the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be a triplet.

I think the most straightforward scenario is that the Hs are on a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl, coupled with two Hs from the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. Hence, the answer would be A) triplet.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Upon heating with excess KOH, the product (product 1) is identified as a ketone based on the IR spectrum showing a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carbonyl group. The NMR data for product 1 includes a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), likely corresponding to a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl, and other peaks consistent with the adamantane framework.

Product 1 is then treated with aluminum isopropoxide (Al(i-Pr)₃), a Lewis acid, to form product 2. While the exact structure of product 2 is not explicitly determined, it is assumed to contain a double bond, as ozonolysis in the next step cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups.

In the final step, product 2 undergoes ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by a reductive workup with dimethyl sulfide, forming product 3. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, and the resulting product 3 contains carbonyl groups. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl group. This hydrogen is part of a CH₂ group, and its coupling pattern is determined by the neighboring hydrogens.

If the structure of product 3 is O=C-CH₂-CH₂-C=O, the CH₂ group adjacent to the carbonyl is coupled with the two hydrogens on the adjacent CH₂ group, resulting in a triplet splitting pattern. This matches the description of the most deshielded hydrogen in the NMR spectrum of product 3.

Thus, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet**.

Answer: A
