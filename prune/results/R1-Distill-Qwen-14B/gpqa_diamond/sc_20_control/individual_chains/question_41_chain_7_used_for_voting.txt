Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory? They take the speed of light in vacuum c as 1.

Hmm. So, the setup is that the glass is moving. The light is going through the glass, and the glass itself is moving in the same direction as the light beam. And the observer is in the lab, watching this happen. I need to find the speed of the light relative to the lab frame.

I remember that when dealing with relative velocities, especially when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, special relativity comes into play. But wait, sometimes when velocities are much smaller than c, we can approximate using classical mechanics. But I'm not sure what the velocities are here. The problem says the glass is moving at velocity v, but doesn't specify. I guess I can't assume v is small compared to c, so maybe I have to use relativistic formulas.

Wait, but the speed of light in the glass is given by n. Because the index of refraction n is the ratio of c (vacuum speed of light) to the speed of light in the medium. So, normally, in the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is c/n. But here, the glass is moving, so the speed as observed in the lab might be different.

Wait, no. Wait, the speed of light in the medium is always c/n, but that's in the medium's rest frame. From the lab frame, which is moving relative to the medium, the speed of light would be different.

Wait, but according to special relativity, the speed of light in a medium is always c in any inertial frame, but that's only for the vacuum case, right? Or is it different when the medium is moving? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, no. Special relativity says that in any inertial frame, the speed of light in a vacuum is c. But when a medium is involved, things get more complicated. Because the medium's properties (like refractive index) are frame-dependent. So when the glass is moving, its refractive index would change as seen from the lab frame.

But wait, the problem states that the index of refraction is n. So perhaps we can model this using the relativistic Doppler effect or some transformation of the medium's properties.

Alternatively, think about it using the relativistic velocity addition formula. Because the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab, and the light is moving at some speed in the glass, which is c/n in the glass's rest frame.

But wait, in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v, so the light's velocity in the lab frame would be different. Let me think about velocity addition.

In special relativity, the velocity u' in one frame is related to the velocity u in another frame moving at velocity v relative to the first. The formula is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c²). But wait, which way is which here?

Wait, the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So, from the lab's perspective, the glass is moving at v. The light's speed in the glass's frame is c/n. So I need to find the speed of the light as observed in the lab.

Wait, no. Let me clarify: in the glass's rest frame (S'), the light is moving at speed u' = c/n. The lab frame (S) is moving at velocity v relative to S'. So from S', the lab is moving at -v.

Wait, no, perhaps I should model it as the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. So the lab is S, and the glass is moving with velocity v, which is the same as the direction of the light beam.

So in the glass's frame S', the light's speed is u' = c/n. Now, to find the speed of the light in the lab frame S, we can use the velocity transformation.

Wait, the velocity addition formula is u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c²). Because if the object is moving at u' in S', then in S, which is moving at velocity v relative to S', the object's velocity u is given by that formula.

So substituting u' = c/n, then u = ( (c/n) + v ) / (1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² )

Simplify denominator:

1 + (v c/(n c²)) ) = 1 + v/(n c)

So u = ( (c + n v) / n ) / ( 1 + v/(n c) )

Wait, let me compute that.

Wait, numerator is (c/n + v) = (c + n v)/n. Denominator is 1 + (v (c/n )) / c² = 1 + (v/(n c)).

So u = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ 1 + v/(n c) ) ]

Hmm, perhaps we can factor this:

Let me write denominator as [ (n c + v )/(n c) ) ] because 1 = n c/(n c), so 1 + v/(n c) = (n c + v)/(n c).

So u = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v)/(n c) ) ]

Which is equal to [ (c + n v)/n ] * [ n c / (n c + v) ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

The n in the numerator of the first fraction cancels with the n in the denominator of the second fraction.

So u = (c + n v) * c / (n c + v)

Wait, but (c + n v) and (n c + v) are the same, right? Because n c + v = v + n c = same as c + n v if you switch terms. Oh wait, no. Wait, (c + n v) is c plus n times v. (n c + v) is n times c plus v. So they're the same if multiplication is commutative, which it is. So (c + n v) = (n v + c) = same as (n c + v) only if n=1. Hmm, no, wait n c + v is n*c plus v, which is different from c +n v unless n=1.

Wait, wait, let me check:

(c + n v) = c + n v.

(n c + v) = n c + v.

So unless n=1, these are different. So then I have u = [c (c + n v)] / (n c + v)

Wait, but the problem says that the speed of light in vacuum is c=1. So let me substitute c=1.

Then u becomes [1*(1 + n v)] / (n *1 + v) ) = (1 + n v)/(n + v)

So the speed of light u is (1 + n v)/(n + v), which seems to match option A.

Wait, but let me think again. The problem states that the light is propagating through the glass, and the glass is moving in the same direction as the light, towards the observer. So in the lab frame, the observer sees the glass moving towards them, but the light is also moving in the same direction as the glass.

Wait, I think I might have mixed up the velocity direction. Let me double-check.

In the glass frame S', the light's speed is u' = c/n, which is in the same direction as the glass is moving. So in S', the light is moving at c/n towards the same direction as the glass's velocity.

So when we transform to S, the lab frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to S' (since the glass is moving at v in the lab frame), the light's velocity u in S would be calculated using the velocity addition formula.

So the formula is u = (u' + v) / (1 + u' v / c² )

Plugging in u' = c/n, and c=1,

u = ( (c/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (c/n * v) / c² )

Simplify denominator: 1 + (v/(n c)).

Again, substituting c=1,

u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/(n) )

Multiply numerator and denominator by n to eliminate the fraction:

Numerator becomes (1 + n v )

Denominator becomes (n + v )

So u = (1 + n v ) / (n + v )

Which is option A.

Wait, looking back at the options, option A is (1 +n v)/(n +v). So that would be the answer.

Wait, but another thought: in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v toward the observer in the same direction as the light. Wait, no, the light is moving through the glass, which is moving toward the observer. So the light's direction is in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the velocity addition formula applies as before.

Alternatively, if the glass is moving towards the observer in the same direction as the light, then perhaps v is in the same direction as the light's propagation. So the calculation holds.

Alternatively, let's consider when the glass is moving in the same direction as the light. So if the light is moving at u in the lab frame, and the glass is moving at v in the same direction, then from the glass frame, the light has velocity u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c² ). Wait, no, wait: the velocity of an object in S' is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c² ), where S is the lab frame moving at v relative to S'.

But in this case, in S' (glass frame), light's speed is u' = c/n. So,

c/n = (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/c² )

But that's more complicated. Let me try solving for u.

Multiply both sides by denominator,

(c/n)(1 - (u v)/c² ) = u - v

Expand left side:

(c/n) - (c u v)/(n c² ) = u - v

Simplify:

(c/n) - (u v)/(n c) ) = u - v

Multiply both sides by n c to eliminate denominators:

c² - u v = n c (u - v )

Expand right side:

c² - u v = n c u - n c v

Bring all terms to left:

c² - u v -n c u +n c v =0

Factor terms:

c² + n c v = u v + n c u

Factor u on right side:

c² +n c v = u (v +n c )

So,

u = (c² +n c v )/(v +n c )

Factor c from numerator:

u = c (c +n v )/(v +n c )

But since c=1,

u=1*(1 +n v )/(v +n )

Which is (1 +n v)/(n +v )

Same as before. So option A is correct.

Wait, but let me think about the options. Option A is (1+nv)/(n +v ), which is what we got. So the answer should be A.

But wait, another point: in the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So the light's speed relative to the lab would be higher than c/n? Because normally, in the rest frame of the medium, it's c/n. But when the medium is moving, perhaps the observed speed increases.

Wait, but according to our calculation, when the glass is moving at velocity v, the speed of light in the lab is (1+nv)/(n +v ). Let's test for some limits.

Suppose v is 0 (glass is stationary). Then u = (1 +0)/(n +0 )=1/n, which makes sense. Because in the glass's rest frame, the light's speed is 1/n.

Another limit: what if v is very small compared to c=1 (so v<<1)? Then we could approximate the expression.

u ≈ (1 + n v )/(n +v ) ≈ [1 +n v ]/(n (1 + v/n )) ≈ [1 +n v ]/(n) (1 - v/n ) using 1/(1+x)≈1-x for small x.

So u ≈ (1/n)(1 +n v ) (1 - v/n )

Multiplying this out:

(1/n)(1 +n v -v/n - (n v v )/n )

Simplify:

(1/n)(1 +n v -v^2 /n )

Wait, perhaps a better approach: expand numerator and denominator for small v.

u = (1 + n v )/(n +v ) = [1 +n v ]/(n (1 + v/(n) )) = (1/n)(1 +n v ) (1 - v/(n ) + (v/(n ))^2 - ... )

Multiplying out:

(1/n) [ (1)(1) + (1)(-v/n ) + (n v)(1) + (n v)(-v/n ) + ... ]

Wait, perhaps it's easier to do a Taylor expansion for (1 +n v)/(n +v ) when v is small.

Let me write it as (1 +n v )/(n (1 + v/(n) )) = (1/(n )) * (1 +n v )/(1 + (v/n) )

The denominator can be expanded as 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 -x +x² -x³ +... where x = v/n.

So (1 +n v) * (1 - v/n + (v/n )² - ... ) /n.

Multiply numerator terms:

(1)(1) =1.

(1)(-v/n )= -v/n.

(n v)(1) =n v.

(n v)(-v/n )= -v².

Higher terms can be neglected.

So numerator becomes:

1 - v/n + n v -v².

Combine like terms:

Constant term: 1.

v terms: (-v/n +n v ) = v (n -1/n )

v² terms: -v².

So for small v, the numerator is 1 + v (n -1/n ) -v².

Divide by n:

u ≈ [1 + v (n -1/n ) -v² ] /n.

Which is (1/n) + (n -1/n ) v /n + higher order terms.

Wait, but if n is greater than 1, the speed of light in the lab would be higher than in the rest frame of the glass. Because when the glass moves in the same direction as the light, the light appears to move faster in the lab. But according to relativity, the speed of light in a medium is less than c, but when the medium is moving, the observed speed might approach c but can't exceed it.

Wait, but the expression (1 +n v)/(n +v ) must be less than c=1, right? Let's check for when v approaches 0, it's 1/n, which is less than 1 as n>1. But for v positive, what happens when v is very large? Let's consider the limit as v approaches infinity.

Wait, but if v approaches c=1, then what happens? Let me take v=1, then u = (1 +n *1 )/(n +1 ) = (n+1)/(n+1 )=1. So u approaches 1, which is the speed of light. Which makes sense, because even if the glass is moving at speed v approaching c, the speed of light in the lab can't exceed c.

Wait, but according to our expression, when v approaches 1, u approaches 1. That fits with special relativity.

Another test: if the glass moves at v=0.5, and n=1 (like air or vacuum, but n=1 implies vacuum). Wait, in that case, what happens?

Wait, n=1, so the medium is vacuum. So the speed of light in the medium is 1. Then the lab frame would see the light moving at (1 +1*0.5 )/(1 +0.5 )= (1.5)/(1.5 )=1, which is correct because in vacuum, the speed of light is always 1, regardless of the motion of the source.

So our formula works in that scenario.

Another scenario: n=2, v=0.5. Then u would be (1 + 2*0.5)/(2 + 0.5 )= (1+1)/(2.5 )= 2/2.5=0.8, which is 4/5. Which is less than 1, so that's acceptable.

So I think the formula holds, and the correct answer is option A: (1 +n v)/(n +v )


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation using relativistic principles. The glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, and the index of refraction of the glass is \( n \). The speed of light in a medium with refractive index \( n \) is \( c/n \) in the rest frame of the medium. However, since the glass is moving relative to the lab frame, the observed speed of light in the lab frame will differ.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Relativistic Velocity Addition**:  
   In the rest frame of the glass (S'), the speed of light is \( u' = c/n \). The lab frame (S) observes the glass moving at velocity \( v \). Using the relativistic velocity addition formula:
   \[
   u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' v}{c^2}}
   \]
   Substituting \( u' = c/n \) and \( c = 1 \), we get:
   \[
   u = \frac{\frac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n c}}
   \]

2. **Simplification**:  
   Substituting \( c = 1 \), the expression becomes:
   \[
   u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
   \]
   Multiply numerator and denominator by \( n \) to simplify:
   \[
   u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
   \]

3. **Verification of Limits**:  
   - If \( v = 0 \) (glass is stationary), the speed of light in the lab frame is \( u = 1/n \), which matches the expected result.  
   - If \( v \to 1 \) (glass moving at the speed of light), \( u \to 1 \), consistent with the invariance of the speed of light in special relativity.  
   - For small \( v \), the expression reduces to the classical approximation, confirming its validity in the relativistic regime.

4. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The derived expression \( u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \) matches **Option A**.

### Conclusion:
The speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is given by \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \), which corresponds to **Option A**.

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory? They take the speed of light in vacuum c as 1.

Hmm. So, the setup is that the glass is moving. The light is going through the glass, and the glass itself is moving in the same direction as the light beam. And the observer is in the lab, watching this happen. I need to find the speed of the light relative to the lab frame.

The problem says the glass is moving at velocity v, but doesn't specify. I guess I can't assume v is small compared to c, so maybe I have to use relativistic formulas.

Wait, but the speed of light in the glass is given by n. Because the index of refraction n is the ratio of c (vacuum speed of light) to the speed of light in the medium. So, normally, in the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is c/n. But here, the glass is moving, so the speed as observed in the lab might be different.

Wait, no. Wait, the speed of light in the medium is always c/n, but that's in the medium's rest frame. From the lab frame, which is moving relative to the medium, the speed of light would be different.

Wait, but according to special relativity, the speed of light in a medium is always c in any inertial frame, but that's only for the vacuum case, right? Or is it different when the medium is moving? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, no. Special relativity says that in any inertial frame, the speed of light in a vacuum is c. But when a medium is involved, things get more complicated. Because the medium's properties (like refractive index) are frame-dependent. So when the glass is moving, its refractive index would change as seen from the lab frame.

But wait, the problem states that the index of refraction is n. So perhaps we can model this using the relativistic Doppler effect or some transformation of the medium's properties.

Alternatively, think about it using the relativistic velocity addition formula. Because the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab, and the light is moving at some speed in the glass, which is c/n in the glass's rest frame.

But wait, in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v, so the light's velocity in the lab frame would be different. Let me think about velocity addition.

In special relativity, the velocity u' in one frame is related to the velocity u in another frame moving at velocity v relative to the first. The formula is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c²). But wait, which way is which here?

Wait, the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So, from the lab's perspective, the glass is moving at v. The light's speed in the glass's frame is c/n. So I need to find the speed of the light as observed in the lab.

Wait, no. Let me clarify: in the glass's rest frame (S'), the light is moving at speed u' = c/n. The lab frame (S) is moving at velocity v relative to S'. So from S', the lab is moving at -v.

Wait, no, perhaps I should model it as the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. So the lab is S, and the glass is moving with velocity v, which is the same as the direction of the light beam.

So in the glass's frame S', the light's speed is u' = c/n. Now, to find the speed of the light in the lab frame S, we can use the velocity transformation.

Wait, the velocity addition formula is u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c²). Because if the object is moving at u' in S', then in S, which is moving at velocity v relative to S', the object's velocity u is given by that formula.

So substituting u' = c/n, then u = ( (c/n) + v ) / (1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² )

Simplify denominator:

1 + (v c/(n c²)) ) = 1 + v/(n c)

So u = ( (c + n v) / n ) / ( 1 + v/(n c) )

Wait, let me compute that.

Wait, numerator is (c/n + v) = (c + n v)/n. Denominator is 1 + (v (c/n )) / c² = 1 + (v/(n c)).

So u = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ 1 + v/(n c) ) ]

Hmm, perhaps we can factor this:

Let me write denominator as [ (n c + v )/(n c) ) ] because 1 = n c/(n c), so 1 + v/(n c) = (n c + v)/(n c).

So u = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v)/(n c) ) ]

Which is equal to [ (c + n v)/n ] * [ n c / (n c + v) ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

The n in the numerator of the first fraction cancels with the n in the denominator of the second fraction.

So u = (c + n v) * c / (n c + v)

Wait, but (c + n v) and (n c + v) are the same, right? Because n c + v = v + n c = same as c + n v if you switch terms. Oh wait, no. Wait, (c + n v) is c plus n times v. (n c + v) is n times c plus v. So they're the same if multiplication is commutative, which it is. So (c + n v) = (n v + c) = same as (n c + v) only if n=1. Hmm, no, wait n c + v is n*c plus v, which is different from c +n v unless n=1.

Wait, wait, let me check:

(c + n v) = c + n v.

(n c + v) = n c + v.

So unless n=1, these are different. So then I have u = [c (c + n v)] / (n c + v)

Wait, but the problem says that the speed of light in vacuum is c=1. So let me substitute c=1.

Then u becomes [1*(1 + n v)] / (n *1 + v) ) = (1 + n v)/(n + v)

So the speed of light u is (1 + n v)/(n + v), which seems to match option A.

Wait, but let me think again. The problem states that the light is propagating through the glass, and the glass is moving in the same direction as the light, towards the observer. So in the lab frame, the observer sees the glass moving towards them, but the light is also moving in the same direction as the glass.

Wait, I think I might have mixed up the velocity direction. Let me double-check.

In the glass frame S', the light's speed is u' = c/n, which is in the same direction as the glass is moving. So in S', the light is moving at c/n towards the same direction as the glass's velocity.

So when we transform to S, the lab frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to S' (since the glass is moving at v in the lab frame), the light's velocity u in S would be calculated using the velocity addition formula.

So the formula is u = (u' + v) / (1 + u' v / c² )

Plugging in u' = c/n, and c=1,

u = ( (c/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (c/n * v) / c² )

Simplify denominator: 1 + (v/(n c)).

Again, substituting c=1,

u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/(n) )

Multiply numerator and denominator by n to eliminate the fraction:

Numerator becomes (1 + n v )

Denominator becomes (n + v )

So u = (1 + n v ) / (n + v )

Which is option A.

Wait, looking back at the options, option A is (1 +n v)/(n +v). So that would be the answer.

Wait, but another thought: in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v toward the observer in the same direction as the light. Wait, no, the light is moving through the glass, which is moving toward the observer. So the light's direction is in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the velocity addition formula applies as before.

Alternatively, if the glass is moving towards the observer in the same direction as the light, then perhaps v is in the same direction as the light's propagation. So the calculation holds.

Alternatively, let's consider when the glass is moving in the same direction as the light. So if the light is moving at u in the lab frame, and the glass is moving at v in the same direction, then from the glass frame, the light has velocity u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c² ). Wait, no, wait: the velocity of an object in S' is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c² ), where S is the lab frame moving at v relative to S'.

But in this case, in S' (glass frame), light's speed is u' = c/n. So,

c/n = (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/c² )

But that's more complicated. Let me try solving for u.

Multiply both sides by denominator,

(c/n)(1 - (u v)/c² ) = u - v

Expand left side:

(c/n) - (c u v)/(n c² ) = u - v

Simplify:

(c/n) - (u v)/(n c) ) = u - v

Multiply both sides by n c to eliminate denominators:

c² - u v = n c (u - v )

Expand right side:

c² - u v = n c u - n c v

Bring all terms to left:

c² - u v -n c u +n c v =0

Factor terms:

c² + n c v = u v + n c u

Factor u on right side:

c² +n c v = u (v +n c )

So,

u = (c² +n c v )/(v +n c )

Factor c from numerator:

u = c (c +n v )/(v +n c )

But since c=1,

u=1*(1 +n v )/(v +n )

Which is (1 +n v)/(n +v )

Same as before. So option A is correct.

Wait, but let me think about the options. Option A is (1+nv)/(n +v ), which is what we got. So the answer should be A.

But wait, another point: in the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So the light's speed relative to the lab would be higher than c/n? Because normally, in the rest frame of the medium, it's c/n. But when the medium is moving, perhaps the observed speed increases.

Wait, but according to our calculation, when the glass is moving at velocity v, the speed of light in the lab is (1+nv)/(n +v ). Let's test for some limits.

Suppose v is 0 (glass is stationary). Then u = (1 +0)/(n +0 )=1/n, which makes sense. Because in the glass's rest frame, the light's speed is 1/n.

Another limit: what if v is very small compared to c=1 (so v<<1)? Then we could approximate the expression.

u ≈ (1 + n v )/(n +v ) ≈ [1 +n v ]/(n (1 + v/n )) ≈ [1 +n v ]/(n) (1 - v/n ) using 1/(1+x)≈1-x for small x.

So u ≈ (1/n)(1 +n v ) (1 - v/n )

Multiplying this out:

(1/n)(1 +n v -v/n - (n v v )/n )

Simplify:

(1/n)(1 +n v -v^2 /n )

Wait, perhaps a better approach: expand numerator and denominator for small v.

u = (1 + n v )/(n +v ) = [1 +n v ]/(n (1 + v/(n) )) = (1/n)(1 +n v ) (1 - v/(n ) + (v/(n ))^2 - ... )

Multiplying out:

(1/n) [ (1)(1) + (1)(-v/n ) + (n v)(1) + (n v)(-v/n ) + ... ]

Wait, perhaps it's easier to do a Taylor expansion for (1 +n v)/(n +v ) when v is small.

Let me write it as (1 +n v )/(n (1 + v/(n) )) = (1/(n )) * (1 +n v )/(1 + (v/n) )

The denominator can be expanded as 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 -x +x² -x³ +... where x = v/n.

So (1 +n v) * (1 - v/n + (v/n )² - ... ) /n.

Multiply numerator terms:

(1)(1) =1.

(1)(-v/n )= -v/n.

(n v)(1) =n v.

(n v)(-v/n )= -v².

Higher terms can be neglected.

So numerator becomes:

1 - v/n + n v -v².

Combine like terms:

Constant term: 1.

v terms: (-v/n +n v ) = v (n -1/n )

v² terms: -v².

So for small v, the numerator is 1 + v (n -1/n ) -v².

Divide by n:

u ≈ [1 + v (n -1/n ) -v² ] /n.

Which is (1/n) + (n -1/n ) v /n + higher order terms.

Wait, but if n is greater than 1, the speed of light in the lab would be higher than in the rest frame of the glass. Because when the glass moves in the same direction as the light, the light appears to move faster in the lab. But according to relativity, the speed of light in a medium is less than c, but when the medium is moving, the observed speed might approach c but can't exceed it.

Wait, but the expression (1 +n v)/(n +v ) must be less than c=1, right? Let's check for when v approaches 0, it's 1/n, which is less than 1 as n>1. But for v positive, what happens when v is very large? Let's consider the limit as v approaches infinity.

Wait, but if v approaches c=1, then what happens? Let me take v=1, then u = (1 +n *1 )/(n +1 ) = (n+1)/(n+1 )=1. So u approaches 1, which is the speed of light. Which makes sense, because even if the glass is moving at speed v approaching c, the speed of light in the lab can't exceed c.

Wait, but according to our expression, when v approaches 1, u approaches 1. That fits with special relativity.

Another test: if the glass moves at v=0.5, and n=1 (like air or vacuum, but n=1 implies vacuum). Wait, in that case, what happens?

Wait, n=1, so the medium is vacuum. So the speed of light in the medium is 1. Then the lab frame would see the light moving at (1 +1*0.5 )/(1 +0.5 )= (1.5)/(1.5 )=1, which is correct because in vacuum, the speed of light is always 1, regardless of the motion of the source.

So our formula works in that scenario.

Another scenario: n=2, v=0.5. Then u would be (1 + 2*0.5)/(2 + 0.5 )= (1+1)/(2.5 )= 2/2.5=0.8, which is 4/5. Which is less than 1, so that's acceptable.

So I think the formula holds, and the correct answer is option A: (1 +n v)/(n +v )


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation using relativistic principles. The glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, and the index of refraction of the glass is \( n \). The speed of light in a medium with refractive index \( n \) is \( c/n \) in the rest frame of the medium. However, since the glass is moving relative to the lab frame, the observed speed of light in the lab frame will differ.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Relativistic Velocity Addition**:  
   In the rest frame of the glass (S'), the speed of light is \( u' = c/n \). The lab frame (S) observes the glass moving at velocity \( v \). Using the relativistic velocity addition formula:
   \[
   u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' v}{c^2}}
   \]
   Substituting \( u' = c/n \) and \( c = 1 \), we get:
   \[
   u = \frac{\frac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n c}}
   \]

2. **Simplification**:  
   Substituting \( c = 1 \), the expression becomes:
   \[
   u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
   \]
   Multiply numerator and denominator by \( n \) to simplify:
   \[
   u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
   \]

3. **Verification of Limits**:  
   - If \( v = 0 \) (glass is stationary), the speed of light in the lab frame is \( u = 1/n \), which matches the expected result.  
   - If \( v \to 1 \) (glass moving at the speed of light), \( u \to 1 \), consistent with the invariance of the speed of light in special relativity.  
   - For small \( v \), the expression reduces to the classical approximation, confirming its validity in the relativistic regime.

4. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The derived expression \( u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \) matches **Option A**.

### Conclusion:
The speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is given by \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \), which corresponds to **Option A**.
