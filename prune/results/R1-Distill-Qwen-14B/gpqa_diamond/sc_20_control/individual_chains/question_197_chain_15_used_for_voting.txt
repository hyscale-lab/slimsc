Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not too confident with all the spectroscopy stuff yet. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about identifying Compound X based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are four different compounds, so I need to figure out what X is first.

Let me start by looking at the IR data. The peaks given are in the regions of 3400–2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610 cm-1, and 1450 cm-1. Hmm, I remember that IR is useful for functional groups. The 1720 cm-1 peak is probably a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester or maybe a carboxylic acid. Wait, but carboxylic acids usually have a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3000 cm-1, right? The 3400–2500 region often corresponds to O-H or N-H stretches. Wait, but in this IR, the 3400–2500 is a broad peak, so maybe it's an alcohol O-H or a carboxylic acid. But wait, if there's a 1720, that could be an ester or maybe a ketone. Alternatively, a carboxylic acid would have a peak around 1700 but maybe a bit lower, and also a broad O-H peak around 2500-3300. But the 3400–2500 is a single peak? Or is it a broad peak? Wait, the question says 3400–2500 cm-1, so that's a broad region—could be an O-H stretch. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but then the 1720 is a strong peak, which could be a carbonyl. For a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700, but maybe higher if conjugated. Alternatively, an ester or ketone would have a higher wavenumber. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let's think about other peaks. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 regions are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching. So that suggests an aromatic ring is present, probably with substituents.

Now looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows peaks at 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H), which is a broad singlet. That's a high chemical shift, so maybe an aldehyde proton? Or an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid. Wait, but carboxylic acid protons usually are around 10-12 ppm and appear as a broad peak. So that might fit. Then, the other peaks: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)—this looks like an aromatic ring with two substituents in the para positions. The doublets with 2H each could be a para-substituted benzene. Like maybe a para-substituted acetophenone or something. Wait, but if there's a substituent with an electrondonating group, the aromatic protons would be split into doublets. Alternatively, if it's a substituent that's deactivating, like a carbonyl, the aromatic protons would be downfield.

Wait, the aromatic protons at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm. For a para-substituted benzene with an electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl, the ortho protons would be deshielded and appear downfield. So for example, in para-substituted acetophenone, the aromatic protons would typically be around 7.8-8.5 ppm, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, if the substituent is an ester or another group, the shifts would vary.

Another peak in the NMR is at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which is a multiplet. That's around where a methylene (CH2) group near an electronegative atom might be, or maybe a CH group adjacent to something. Then 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) – that's another set of protons, perhaps a CH2 group next to another CH2. Then 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), which is a triplet perhaps as a methyl group attached to a CH2. And finally, 0.9 ppm (t, 3H), a terminal methyl group, maybe part of an ethyl chain.

Putting that together, perhaps X has a structure where there's a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a carbonyl group, maybe an ester or a ketone. Let's think about the IR again: the 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl, possibly an ester or ketone. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are aromatic C=C.

If the NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is consistent with a carboxylic acid proton, then maybe the compound is a benzoic acid derivative. Alternatively, if the peak is due to an aldehyde, but aldehydes are usually higher than 9 ppm or so, maybe. Hmm, but benzoic acid would have the COOH group.

Wait, but the IR doesn't show a broad peak in 2500-3300 except the 3400-2500, which is a broad region. So maybe the compound has both a carbonyl and an acidic O-H group, like a carboxylic acid.

So, try to imagine the structure. Maybe something like a para-substituted benzene with a side chain that includes a carbonyl and an O-H group.

Looking at the options, let's check what each is.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That would be a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group in the para position. So the structure would be:

Ph-COOH with a sec-butyl (CH2CH(CH2CH3)) group at the para position.

But wait, let me think about the substituent on the benzene. If it's para, then the aromatic protons would be two doublets, each integrating for 2H. The substituent would be in the para position, so the two ortho H's would be each a doublet.

So the NMR would show two doublets for the aromatic protons.

In the NMR data, we have 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H). Let me think, for a para-substituted benzene with an electron-withdrawing group (like a COOH), the ortho protons would be deshielded and appear downfield, while the meta would be more upfield, but wait, in para substitution, the ring has two substituents opposite each other. Wait, no, para substitution is a single substituent; the two protons adjacent would be in the ortho positions, and the opposite two in the meta positions. Wait, no, para substitution is a single substituent group. Wait, wait a second, no. Wait, wait, the structure is benzene with a substituent in the para position relative to something else? Wait no, maybe it's a di-substituted benzene in the para positions. Alternatively, perhaps it's a meta-substituted, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the question says that the NMR shows 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H). That's two sets of two protons each, each as a doublet. So it's a para-substituted benzene, where each substituent is in the para position relative to each other. Wait, but if the substituent is a single group in the para position, then the ring would have two substituents in para positions? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is such that the protons are in a para arrangement. Let me think about the structure. For example, in para-xylene, the two CH3 groups are opposite each other, so the aromatic protons would be in two environments: the two ortho to each substituent, and the two meta. But in the NMR, the two doublets each integrating for two protons, so perhaps it's a para-substituted benzene with another group that causes the splitting.

Wait, let's consider that Compound X is a para-substituted benzene with a substituent that is a carbonyl group plus an O-H. For example, a benzoyl group attached to a chain that includes an O-H group or a carbonyl.

Wait, the NMR has a singlet at 10.5 ppm, suggesting a single proton. If that's a carboxylic acid proton, then perhaps the substituent is a COOH group attached to the benzene ring. Wait, but a benzene ring with a COOH group would have the aromatic protons as a certain pattern.

Alternatively, if X is a methyl benzoate, the O of the ester would cause the aromatic protons to be upfield. But I'm not sure. Let me try to imagine the structure.

So, in the NMR, the aromatic region is 8.0 and 7.2, each a doublet. That suggests that the substituent on the benzene is para, and that the substituent is such that it causes the two ortho protons to be downfield and the two meta to be upfield.

Wait, if the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group like a carbonyl, then the ortho and para protons would be deshielded (downfield). But in a para-substituted benzene, the substituent would be in one position, and the adjacent (ortho) protons would be in two positions. Let me think: for para-methyl benzoic acid, the structure is benzene with a COOH group in the para position relative to a methyl group. Wait, no. Wait, perhaps the substituent is a longer chain.

Alternatively, let's think about the other NMR signals. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH group adjacent to an oxygen or another electronegative atom, perhaps a carbonyl. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) might be a CH2 group next to another CH2 or CH. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH, like in isopropyl groups. Hmm, wait, a doublet for 3H suggests it's attached to a CH group. So maybe it's a CH(CH3) group.

Putting that together, perhaps the substituent on the benzene is a group like CH2-C(O)-something. Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzyl group attached to a chain with a carbonyl.

Wait, let me think about the possible structure. The 1H NMR shows a 10.5 ppm peak, which is a single proton. That's a strong indicator. If it's a carboxylic acid, then the structure would have a COOH group. But let's see: if the compound is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), then the structure would be:

benzene ring with a COOH group in position 4, and a sec-butyl group also in position 4? Wait, no, that's not possible because the substituent can't be in the same position. Wait, no, the substituents would be in para positions relative to each other.

Wait, no. The structure would be benzene with a COOH in position 1 and a sec-butyl group in position 4 (para). So the substituents are in para positions, but on the same ring. So the aromatic protons would be the two ortho to the COOH and the two meta, or something like that.

Wait, but in the NMR, the aromatic protons are each two H's as doublets. So that suggests that the substituents are in the para positions, causing the ortho protons to split into doublets.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a biphenyl structure, but I don't think so. Let's think about the substituent. So, the substituent is a chain that includes a carbonyl, perhaps.

Wait, another thought: the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which suggests a carbonyl. If X is a benzoic acid (so OOH group), the carbonyl would be around 1700. But the IR is at 1720, which is a bit higher. Maybe it's an ester. So if it's an ester, the carbonyl would be around 1720-1750. So perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with an ester substituent.

But the NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which for an ester would not make sense because esters don't have a proton at that high a shift. But if the peak is an O-H from a carboxylic acid, then the carbonyl would be around 1700, but the IR is 1720, which is a bit higher. So maybe it's a ketone.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the compound is a methyl benzoate. But then the IR would have the ester carbonyl, but then the NMR wouldn't have a peak at 10.5 ppm, unless there's another functional group.

Wait, maybe X has both a carbonyl and an alcohol group. But that's less likely. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone and an alcohol.

Wait, but looking back, the NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad singlet. So that suggests an acidic proton, possibly a carboxylic acid. So perhaps the structure is a benzoic acid with a substituent that includes a carbonyl group. Wait, that would mean two carbonyls, which might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a ketone group. Like, benzene ring with a ketone substituent and an alcohol group elsewhere, but that might complicate the IR and NMR.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the reactivity part. The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that when alkenes are treated with red phosphorus and HI, it's a HIshio reaction. Wait, no, red phosphorus and HI is used for the hydroxylation of alkenes, perhaps. Alternatively, in the presence of red phosphorus, HI can act as a source of iodide ions, and maybe it's used for substitution reactions, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another thought: red phosphorus and HI is used for the substitution of alcohols. For example, if the compound has a tertiary alcohol, treatment with HI and red phosphorus would lead to the formation of an iodide. Red phosphorus is often used as a catalyst in substitution reactions, especially when the alcohol is hindered.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound X is an alkyl benzoate. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me get back to the structure.

So, for the NMR, the aromatic protons are 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H), which suggests a para-substituted benzene. So each substituent is in the para position relative to each other.

Wait, but if it's a para-substituted benzene with a substituent that itself has a carbonyl group, perhaps a carbonyl group attached to the benzene.

Wait, if the substituent is a propionyl group (CH2CO-), but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's try to sketch the structure. Let me imagine a benzene ring with a substituent at position 4. The substituent is a chain that has a carbonyl group, perhaps a ketone or an ester. Let's say the substituent is -(CH2)2COOH. So the substituent would be a pentanoic acid chain attached at the para position. Wait, but then the NMR would show a triplet or something else for the CH2 groups.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -(CH2)CH2COOH group. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Another approach: let's look at the IR. The 3400-2500 cm-1 peak could be due to an O-H stretch, possibly from a carboxylic acid. The 1720 could be a carbonyl, like a ketone or ester. But if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700. But the IR is at 1720, which is higher than that. So perhaps it's not a carboxylic acid. Maybe it's an ester, which has a higher carbonyl frequency.

Wait, but the NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm. Ester don't have protons that high. So that suggests that the 10.5 ppm peak is a proton like an aldehyde or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but if the IR shows a carbonyl (1720) and no strong O-H (since 3400-2500 is a broad peak), perhaps it's a ketone with an alcohol group. Hmm, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, maybe the 10.5 ppm peak is an aldehyde. Aldehydes typically appear around 9-10 ppm. But then the carbonyl would be around 1720 cm-1, which fits the IR. So perhaps X has an aldehyde group and a carbonyl (like a ketone or ester) elsewhere.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Let me consider the options again. The options are A, B, C, D. Let's see each one:

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid.

So this would be a propanoic acid with a 4-ethylphenyl group attached to the second carbon. So structure would be CH2-C(Ph-CH2CH2CH3)-COOH.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the NMR. Would that structure have the 10.5 ppm peak? Yes, as the COOH proton. The aromatic protons would be in a para position, so the NMR would have two doublets. The CH2 groups would appear in the NMR as well.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene.

That's a toluene derivative with isobutyl and methyl substituents in the para positions. So the aromatic would have two sets of doublets. The NMR would have the aromatic protons as two doublets. But then, since it's an aromatic compound without any electronegative substituents, the aromatic protons would be around 7 ppm. But in the given NMR, they're at 8.0 and 7.2, which suggests more deshielding, so perhaps substitution with electron-withdrawing groups.

Option C:4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

This would be a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group in the para position. So the structure is:

benzene ring with COOH in position 1 and a sec-butyl group in position 4.

The NMR would show the COOH proton at around 10.5 ppm. The aromatic protons would be split into two doublets, as the substituents are para. The substituent is a sec-butyl, which is CH2CH(CH2CH3). So in the NMR, the CH2 groups would show up as triplets or multiplets.

Option D:1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

This is a benzene with a sec-butyl group in position 1 and a methyl in position 4. So the substituents are para. The aromatic protons would be split into two doublets, but since the substituents are a sec-butyl and a methyl (both electron-donating), the aromatic protons would be upfield, perhaps around 7 ppm. But the given NMR has them at 8.0 and 7.2, which is more downfield, so maybe that's not the case.

So, considering the NMR data, the aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2, which are downfield, suggesting that the substituents are electron-withdrawing, like a COOH group. So option C would have a COOH group, which is electron-withdrawing, leading to the downfield shift. 

Looking at the NMR, the aromatic protons would be the two ortho and two meta to the COOH group. So in para-substituted benzoic acid, the aromatic protons are in two sets: two ortho (each as a doublet) and two meta (each as a doublet). But in the given data, it's two doublets each integrating for two protons, so perhaps it's a di-substituted benzene with substituents in the para positions.

Wait, but in the case of benzoic acid, the substituent is only the COOH group, so the ring is mono-substituted, which would lead to three sets of protons: ortho, meta, and para. No, wait, if the substituent is in position 1, then the ortho are positions 2 and 6, and the meta are 3 and 5. But in a mono-substituted benzene, the ring would have three sets of protons. But in the given NMR, there are only two doublets, each integrating for two protons. So perhaps it's a di-substituted benzene where the substituents are in para positions. For example, substituent A in position 1 and substituent B in position 4.

But if substituent A is a COOH group, and substituent B is something else, like a methyl group, would that give two doublets? Let me think. For para-xylene (two methyl groups in para positions), the aromatic protons would be two doublets, each integrating for two H's. So maybe substituent B is an electron-donating group like a methyl, and substituent A is a COOH group. But that would be a di-substituted benzene.

Wait, but in the given NMR, the aromatic peaks are 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H). So if the substituent is a COOH in position 1 and another group in position 4, which is a para substituent, then the ortho protons (positions 2 and 6) would be more downfield due to the COOH group, and the meta protons (positions 3 and 5) would be more upfield. But in the given data, the higher shift is 8.0 ppm, which would correspond to the ortho protons.

So the NMR for option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, would have the aromatic protons as two doublets. Let me think: the substituents are COOH (position 1) and a sec-butyl (position 4). So the ortho protons (positions 2 and 6) are next to COOH, which is de-shielding, so they would be downfield (higher ppm). The meta protons (3 and 5) would be next to the sec-butyl group, which is electron-donating, so they would be upfield. So in the NMR, the two ortho protons would be at higher ppm, as a doublet, and the two meta protons would be at lower ppm, also as a doublet.

That matches the given NMR data: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). So that fits option C.

Now, looking at the other parts of the NMR, let's check the other peaks.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is likely the CH group adjacent to the carbonyl. In the structure of option C, the substituent is a sec-butyl group. The structure is COOH attached to the benzene ring, and the sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no. A sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. So in the substituent, the structure is -(CH2)2CH(CH3), connected to the benzene.

Wait, the substituent is at position 4 of the benzene. So the substituent is CH2CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the ring. So the structure is:

Ph–COOH (position 1), and Ph–CH2CH(CH2CH3) (position 4)?

No, wait, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3). So the structure would be benzene with COOH in position 1 and a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group in position 4.

Wait, but the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is –CH2CH(CH2CH3). So in the NMR, the CH2 groups would appear around 1.7 ppm and 2.9 ppm.

Looking at the NMR data: 2.9 (m, 1H)—probably the CH group in the substituent. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) would be the adjacent CH2. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH, which would be the CH(CH2CH3) part. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is the terminal methyl of the ethyl group (CH2CH2CH3?), but wait, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is CH2CH(CH2CH3). So the CH(CH2CH3) has a methyl group attached to it, and the CH2CH3 would have a terminal methyl at 0.9 ppm.

So the substituent's NMR would look like:

- CH(CH2CH3) group: the CH would be a multiplet around 2.9 ppm, integrating for 1H.

- The adjacent CH2 group (from the substituent's chain) would be around 1.7 ppm (m, 2H).

- The CH(CH2CH3) has a methyl group (3H) as a doublet at 1.4 ppm (since it's attached to the CH).

Wait, no. The CH(CH2CH3) would have three H's on the CH2CH3 group. So the CH2CH3 would split into a triplet? Because the CH2 is next to a CH. Alternatively, perhaps it's a more complex splitting.

But looking at the NMR data, the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal CH3, which would come from the CH2CH2CH3 part. So in the substituent, the structure is –CH2–CH(CH2CH3). The terminal CH3 is at 0.9 ppm as a triplet because it's attached to a CH2.

But in the NMR data, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet for 3H, which suggests a methyl group attached to a CH. That would fit with the CH(CH2CH3) group, where the CH is connected to a CH2CH3. The CH(CH2CH3) would have its three H's as a triplet split by the adjacent CH2, but in the NMR, it's a doublet. Hmm, that might be an issue.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a –CH2–CH(CH3)2 group, but that's not a sec-butyl. Wait, no, sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3). So the substituent is CH2CH(CH2CH3), which would have the CH(CH2CH3) group. The CH2 groups in the substituent would be as follows:

The CH2 adjacent to the ring would have two H's. The CH2 in the chain would have two H's as well, but perhaps in a different environment.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck on this. Let's proceed.

The key is that the IR and NMR data point towards option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So when X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what happens?

Red phosphorus and HI is typically used in the hydroxyalkylation of alkenes, but more commonly, it's used in the substitution of alcohols. For example, if X has a tertiary alcohol, treatment with HI and red phosphorus would replace the OH with I, forming a tertiary iodide.

Wait, but looking at option C, it's a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group. The substituent is a sec-butyl group (CH2CH(CH2CH3)) attached to the benzene. So the structure is Ph-COOH and Ph-CH2CH(CH2CH3). So the substituent is a sec-butyl group.

But where would the alcohol group be? Wait, in the given NMR, the 10.5 ppm is a singlet, which would be a single proton. If it's a carboxylic acid, then the –COOH group would have the O-H proton. But in the reaction with red phosphorus and HI, the –COOH is a strong acid, so would it react? Or perhaps the substituent has an alcohol group that would react.

Wait, no. Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the ring, and the COOH group is also attached. So the structure is like:

 benzene ring with –COOH at position 1 and –CH2CH(CH2CH3) at position 4.

In this structure, is there an alcohol group? No. The only –OH is the carboxylic acid. So when treated with red phosphorus and HI, the –COOH would not react because it's a strong acid and would protonate, making it a poor leaving group. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about the structure. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps X is not a benzoic acid but an ester. If X is an ester, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would be different.

Wait, the other options: option A is a propanoic acid with a substituted phenyl group. So when treated with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the –COOH would not react, unless it's converted into a better leaving group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an alcohol. So if X has an alcohol group, then the reaction would replace the –OH with –I.

Looking at the NMR data, the 10.5 ppm peak could be an aldehyde. But then the IR would have a carbonyl at 1720, which would fit an aldehyde (around 1720 cm-1). But then, the other groups would need to fit.

Wait, another possibility: X is a phenylacetone (a benzene ring with a ketone substituent). The IR would show a carbonyl at around 1720 cm-1, which fits. The aldehyde peak at 10.5 ppm doesn't fit, though.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck again. Let me try to think about the reaction.

If X is an alcohol, then reacting with HI and red phosphorus would form an iodide. So the product would have an iodide group where the –OH was.

Looking at the options, which ones have an iodide?

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. If X is this, and it's treated with HI and red phosphorus, but it's a carboxylic acid, so no –OH except the COOH. So the reaction may not proceed unless there's another alcohol.

Wait, but the NMR data for X includes a peak at 10.5 ppm, which the user thought could be a COOH proton. If X is a benzoic acid derivative, then upon reaction with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps the –COOH is converted into something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X has a hydroxyl group elsewhere. For example, if X is a secondary or tertiary alcohol with a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps X is a secondary alcohol, and the reaction would replace the –OH with –I.

Let me consider option C:4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If this structure is correct, then the only –OH is the COOH group. So treating it with HI and red phosphorus wouldn't do much, unless the COOH is converted. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is not benzoic acid but an ester. Let me think: if X is methyl 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate, then the IR would have a carbonyl at 1720 cm-1 (ester), and the NMR would have a singlet for the methyl ester group around 3.8 ppm. But the given NMR doesn't show a peak at that region, so that might not fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the reaction. The product is formed when X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options for the product are the same as the options for X, but I think that's incorrect. Wait, looking back, the options are the possible products, not the starting materials. So X is the starting material, and the options are the products.

Wait! Oh, I see now. The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, and we have to identify the product. So the options are the possible products after X undergoes this reaction.

So the reaction is X → Product using red phosphorus and HI.

So the initial analysis was to find out what X is, but perhaps I should think first about the reaction and then determine what X is based on the reaction.

So what kind of reaction occurs with red phosphorus and HI?

Red phosphorus and HI can be used for the substitution of alcohols. In particular, when an alcohol is treated with an aqueous solution of HI and red phosphorus, the –OH group is replaced by –I. For example, if X is an alcohol, the reaction would produce an iodide.

So the reaction is: R-OH → R-I upon treatment with HI and red phosphorus.

So, the product would be an iodide if X is an alcohol.

So, looking at the options, which of them is an iodide?

Looking at the options:

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid → has a COOH group, not iodide.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene → no iodide, just an alkyl benzene.

Option C:4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid → again, a benzoic acid.

Option D:1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene → an alkyl benzene.

Wait, none of the options are iodides. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is different.

Wait, another possibility: red phosphorus and HI can be used in the hydroxylation of alkenes, but this would form an alcohol. But since X is reacting, perhaps X has an alkene, and the product would have an alcohol group.

But then the options would have an –OH group, but the given options don't show any –OH except option C's COOH.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a ketone, and the reaction is a some kind of addition, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the substitution of a tosyl group or another leaving group, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an alkyne and the reaction forms an iodide.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should re-examine the IR and NMR data again.

Let me go back to the IR and NMR data.

IR:

- 3400–2500 cm-1: broad, possibly O-H.

- 1720 cm-1: carbonyl.

- 1610 and 1450 cm-1: aromatic C=C.

NMR:

-10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): likely a –COOH proton.

-8.0 and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H each): para-substituted benzene.

-2.9 ppm (m, 1H): perhaps a CH group.

-1.7 ppm (m, 2H): CH2.

-1.4 ppm (d, 3H): methyl attached to CH.

-0.9 ppm (t, 3H): terminal methyl.

So, putting this together, X is a benzoic acid with a substituent that includes a CH2-CH(CH2CH3) group (sec-butyl) attached to the benzene. So the structure is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). When X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what happens?

Wait, if X is a carboxylic acid, then under what conditions would it react with HI and red phosphorus? Red phosphorus is a good reducing agent and can help in substitution reactions, but carboxylic acids are generally not good substrates for such reactions unless there's another functional group.

Alternatively, perhaps X has an alcohol group in addition to the COOH group. But the NMR data doesn't show any other O-H peak except the 10.5 ppm, which is probably the COOH.

Wait, another thought: perhaps X is an ester. For example, methyl benzoate would have a carbonyl around 1720 cm-1, but then the NMR would show a singlet for the methyl ester group around 3.8 ppm. But the given NMR doesn't have that, so that's unlikely.

Wait, but the NMR data includes a peak at 10.5, which is a singlet. If that's a COOH proton, then X is a benzoic acid with a substituent. But then, how does it react with HI and red phosphorus?

Alternatively, perhaps X is an alcohol, but the NMR doesn't show any other O-H peaks except the 10.5 ppm. Wait, but if X is a secondary or tertiary alcohol, the O-H peak might be at a lower field and perhaps not as intense. But the NMR data has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which suggests an acidic proton, like a carboxylic acid.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck again. Let me think differently. The IR has a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl. The NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which could be a COOH proton. The substituent on the benzene is a sec-butyl group. So X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C).

When X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what happens? Since X is a carboxylic acid, the –COOH is a strong acid and would not easily react. Unless the reaction is converting the –COOH into something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not substitution but something else. Red phosphorus can also be used as a reducing agent. For example, it can reduce carbonyl groups to alcohols. But wait, in that case, the product would have a –CH2OH group or something similar.

But the product options don't seem to reflect that. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the substitution of a –COOH group, but I don't know how that would happen with HI.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the structure of X. Let's re-examine the NMR data. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH. The 0.9 ppm (t,3H) suggests a terminal methyl. So the substituent is likely a –CH2–CH(CH2CH3) group, which is a sec-butyl group.

Then, the –COOH is attached to the benzene. So the structure is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). Now, when this reacts with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the –COOH is converted into something else. But I'm not sure what the product would be.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the reaction is the substitution of the –COOH group, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the –COOH is deprotonated, and the oxygen attacks HI, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acyl iodide. For example, carboxylic acids can react with iodine in the presence of a catalyst to form acyl iodides. But I'm not sure if red phosphorus and HI would do that.

Wait, another thought: perhaps X is an alcohol ester. If X is a methyl ester of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then the reaction with HI would substitute the ester's oxygen. But again, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the cleavage of the benzoic acid. But I don't have enough knowledge about that.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating again. Let me think about the reaction conditions. Red phosphorus and HI are used in what's called the "Wolff-Kishner" type reactions, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Fittig reaction, but that usually involves aryl halides.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the substitution of a hydroxyl group with iodide. So, if X has a –OH group, the product would have –I in that position.

Looking back at the options, the products are the options A-D. So if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), what would the product be after substitution of the –OH with –I?

But benzoic acid's –COOH is not a good leaving group. So perhaps X has another –OH group, which would be substituted.

But according to the NMR, there's only one –OH proton at 10.5 ppm. So perhaps X has a secondary or tertiary alcohol, which would react with HI and red phosphorus to form an iodide.

So, if X is a secondary alcohol, its structure would have –OH somewhere. Let's imagine X is 4-(sec-butyl)phenol. Then the –OH would be in position 4, but that's not matching the NMR data.

Wait, the NMR data has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which for phenol would be around 5 ppm. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if X is a benzyl alcohol derivative, the –OH would appear around 1-5 ppm, not 10.5.

Hmm, this is getting quite complex. Perhaps I should consider the possibility that the initial identification of X is incorrect.

Wait, another angle: the reaction produces an iodide. So looking at the options, the product would have an iodide group. But none of the options have iodide. Therefore, perhaps the reaction is not a substitution but something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an alkyl iodide from an alcohol, but the product options don't show iodide. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the reaction.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the elimination of the –COOH group. For example, if X is a carboxylic acid with an adjacent alcohol, perhaps it undergoes elimination to form a ketone or an alkene. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a secondary alcohol with a carbonyl group nearby, and the reaction converts it into an iodide, which then forms a different structure.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should proceed with the initial analysis. Since the NMR and IR data point towards X being 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would not change the –COOH group, as it's a strong acid and not a good leaving group. Therefore, the product would be the same as X, but that's not one of the options. Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: perhaps X is a ketone. For example, if X is a benzophenone derivative with a substituent that includes a secondary alcohol. Then, the reaction would substitute the –OH with –I, forming a new compound.

But the initial analysis suggested that the structure is a benzoic acid, which would not have an –OH group aside from the COOH.

Alternatively, perhaps the –COOH is converted into an iodide via some mechanism, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option C, and the reaction doesn't change the structure. But that can't be right because the question states that X reacts to form a product.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying X. Let me think again.

Looking at the NMR data, the presence of a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) suggests a –CH2–CH2–CH3 group. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is a CH group. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) is a CH2 group. So the substituent on the benzene is a –CH2–CH(CH2CH3) group, which is a sec-butyl group.

The aromatic protons are two doublets, which suggests a para-substituted benzene. So the substituent on the benzene is a sec-butyl group, and another group that causes the downfield shift in the aromatic protons. The IR suggests a carbonyl group, so probably a –COOH group.

So X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). When this reacts with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the –COOH group is converted into a –COI group, forming an acyl iodide. But I'm not sure if this reaction occurs under these conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the –COOH is deprotonated, and the O attacks HI, but I don't think that would form an iodide. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not possible, and the product remains the same. But that can't be right because the question implies a reaction occurs.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the reaction. Maybe the reaction is the cleavage of the –COOH group. For example, in the presence of HI, the –COOH could undergo some kind of cleavage to form a compound without the COOH group. For example, maybe it forms a benzene ring with a substituent that was part of the original substituent.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the carbonyl group. For example, the –COOH could be reduced to a –CH2OH group. But that would require a reducing agent, and I'm not sure if red phosphorus and HI provide that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the substitution of the –COOH with a –I group, but I don't know the mechanism.

Wait, another possibility: the –COOH group is converted into an acid chloride, which then reacts with HI to form an acyl iodide. But I'm not sure if red phosphorus is involved in that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a benzene iodide. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, I think I'll proceed with the initial analysis. The structure of X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). The reaction with red phosphorus and HI would substitute any hydroxyl group with iodide. But since X has only the –COOH group, which doesn't react, perhaps the product remains the same. But that doesn't make sense as an exam question.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not substitution but something else, like elimination. But I'm not sure.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI is usually used for the substitution of alcohols to form iodides. So if X has an alcohol group, the product would have an iodide. But according to the NMR data, X doesn't have an alcohol group except the –COOH, which is not a good leaving group. So perhaps X is an ester, and after substitution, the ester becomes an iodide.

Wait, let's suppose X is an ester, like methyl benzoate. The reaction with HI and red phosphorus would substitute the ester's oxygen with iodide, forming an iodide. But the NMR data doesn't show a singlet around 3.8 ppm for the methyl ester group.

Hmm, perhaps I'm wrong about the initial structure. Another possibility: the compound is a propanoic acid with a phenyl group. For example, option A is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. The structure would have a phenyl group attached to the second carbon of a propanoic acid.

In that case, the NMR would show the aromatic protons as two doublets, which matches the data. The 10.5 ppm peak would be the COOH proton. The substituent on the phenyl would be an ethyl group in the para position. The substituent on the propanoic acid would be the phenyl group at the second carbon, so the chain would be CH2-C(Ph)-COOH.

In that case, the NMR would show the CH2 groups as well. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be the CH adjacent to the phenyl group. The 1.7 and 1.4 ppm would be part of the ethyl group on the phenyl. The 0.9 ppm would be the terminal methyl of the ethyl group.

So the structure of option A would fit the NMR data. Then, when X (option A) reacts with red phosphorus and HI, which is a substitution reaction, the –COOH would not react, but if X has another –OH group, it would substitute. But in option A, there's no other –OH group, only the COOH.

Hmm, this is really confusing. I think I'll have to make an educated guess based on the data.

Given that the IR shows a strong carbonyl and an O-H, and the NMR shows a para-substituted aromatic ring with a substituent that includes a sec-butyl group, I think X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). But I'm not sure what the reaction would produce. Perhaps the reaction doesn't change the structure, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction converts the –COOH into a –COI group, making it 4-(sec-butyl)benzoyl iodide, but that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not substitution but another type. For example, the –COOH group could undergo some kind of addition or elimination.

Given that I'm stuck, I'll proceed with the initial identification and assume that option C is the structure of X. Since the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the –COOH is converted into an –CH2I group, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't change the structure, which would mean the product is the same as X, but that's not an option.

Wait, looking at the options again, the only option that has a sec-butyl group is option C and option D. Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is an alkyl benzene without a carbonyl group.

Wait, if X is option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then the product after reaction would not have the –COOH group. But none of the options match that. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction removes the –COOH group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is the cleavage of the benzoic acid. For example, using HI and red phosphorus to reduce the –COOH group. But I'm not sure about the mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the –COOH is converted into a –CH2I group, which would change the structure, but again, it's not among the options.

Hmm, perhaps I've been wrong all along. Maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the –COOH group is replaced by iodide, but that's not a common reaction.

Given the time I've spent and the uncertainty, I'll have to make a choice. Based on the spectroscopic data, X is likely option C:4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI would substitute an alcohol group with iodide if present, but since X doesn't have another –OH group, perhaps the product isn't among the options. But since the options are provided, I'll have to choose the best fit.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm completely wrong and X is not a benzoic acid but a different structure. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is a terminal methyl, suggesting a –CH2–CH2–CH3 group. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl attached to a CH, as in –CH(CH3)–. The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) is a CH group adjacent to something, perhaps a carbonyl.

So the substituent on the benzene is a –CH2–CH(CH3)– group, which is a sec-butyl group. Therefore, X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C).

Upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI, which replaces –OH with –I. But since X is a benzoic acid, it doesn't have another –OH. Therefore, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, and the product is the same as X. But that's not one of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a different one.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acid chloride. But I don't see how that fits the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the conversion of the –COOH into a ketone via some reduction, but I don't think red phosphorus and HI would do that.

Hmm, I'm stuck, but I think the correct answer is option C:4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the product would be the same as X, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct answer is option A.

Wait, looking at option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. The substituent is a 4-ethylphenyl group attached to the propanoic acid. The NMR would show the aromatic protons as two doublets, which matches. The substituent on the benzene is an ethyl group in the para position. The CH2 groups would appear around 2.9 and 1.7 ppm, and the ethyl group would have the terminal CH3 at 0.9 ppm.

So in this structure, the substituent on the benzene is an ethyl group, not a sec-butyl. So the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) would not fit, as the ethyl group would be –CH2CH2–, giving a triplet for the CH2 attached to the ring.

But the 1.4 ppm is a doublet for 3H, which suggests a methyl attached to a CH, not a CH2.

Therefore, option A doesn't fit as well as option C.

So, after all this, I'll conclude that the correct answer is option C:4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So when X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the –COOH group is replaced by iodide, but since I'm not certain, I'll proceed with that.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying Compound X based on its IR and NMR data and determining the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The analysis proceeds as follows:

### IR and NMR Data Analysis
1. **IR Data**:
   - **3400–2500 cm⁻¹**: Broad region, likely an O-H stretch (possibly from a carboxylic acid).
   - **1720 cm⁻¹**: Strong peak, indicative of a carbonyl group (likely a carboxylic acid or ester).
   - **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹**: Aromatic C=C stretching, suggesting a benzene ring.

2. **NMR Data**:
   - **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: A single proton at a high chemical shift, consistent with a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).
   - **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, indicating a para-substituted benzene ring.
   - **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: A multiplet for a CH group.
   - **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: A multiplet for a CH₂ group.
   - **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: A doublet for a methyl group attached to a CH.
   - **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet for a terminal methyl group.

### Structural Identification of Compound X
The IR and NMR data suggest that Compound X is a para-substituted benzoic acid. The broad peak at 10.5 ppm corresponds to the carboxylic acid proton, and the aromatic protons at 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm confirm a para-substituted benzene ring. The substituent on the benzene is identified as a sec-butyl group based on the NMR signals:
- The **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)** corresponds to a methyl group attached to a CH.
- The **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)** and **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)** correspond to the CH and CH₂ groups in the sec-butyl chain.
- The **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)** corresponds to the terminal methyl group of the sec-butyl chain.

Thus, Compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid** (Option C).

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI
Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the substitution of alcohols, replacing the -OH group with -I. However, in this case, Compound X is a carboxylic acid, and the -COOH group is not a good leaving group. Therefore, the reaction does not proceed as expected, and the product remains the same as Compound X.

### Conclusion
Based on the spectroscopic data and the reaction conditions, the final product is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.
