Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step. 

The problem says: We have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. I remember that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, first, I think I need to normalize this state because it's only proportional, not necessarily normalized yet.

Wait, right, the state is given as proportional, so I'll need to find the normalization factor. The state is a linear combination of |up> and |down>, which are orthonormal. So the normalization factor is 1 over the square root of the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients.

The coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i). Let me compute their magnitudes. The magnitude of (1+i) is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). For (2-i), it's sqrt(2^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4+1)=sqrt(5). So the normalization factor squared would be (sqrt(2))^2 + (sqrt(5))^2 over 1. Wait, no, wait: normalization is 1/sqrt( (1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i) ). Because the inner product of a state with itself is the sum of the squared magnitudes.

Calculating (1+i)(1-i) = 1 - i^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2. (2-i)(2+i) = 4 + (i^2)(-1) → wait, no, (a-bi)(a+bi)=a² + b². So 2² +1²=4+1=5. So the total is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the actual state |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Wait, but the problem says it's proportional, so I think that's the correct normalization.

Next, the problem asks about the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. The operator has a matrix representation A where A_ij is hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, what does that matrix look like? Let's think in terms of a 2x2 matrix since we're dealing with up and down states, which are two-dimensional. So the operator matrix A is:

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
       [hbar/2, 0] ].

Wait, because for i≠j, A_ij is hbar/2, and when i=j, it's zero. So it's a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere.

Wait, but what's this operator? It looks familiar. Oh, right! The Pauli matrices. The sigma_x matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], sigma_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and sigma_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So the given matrix A has off-diagonal elements of hbar/2. So maybe it's (hbar/2) times the sigma_x matrix. Because sigma_x has the same structure.

So, operator A is (hbar/2) * sigma_x. Because sigma_x has 1s off-diagonal and 0s on diagonal. So A = (hbar/2) σ_x.

But wait, the eigenstates of σ_x are the same as the eigenstates of A, because A is just a scalar multiple of σ_x. So the eigenstates of A are the same as the eigenstates of σ_x.

The eigenstates of σ_x are superpositions of |up> and |down>. Specifically, the eigenstates can be written as |+x> and |−x>, where |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |−x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Or wait, maybe it's (|up> + i|down>)/sqrt(2) for another eigenstate? Wait, no, the eigenstates of σ_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), because σ_x is real and symmetric.

Wait, let me think again. The eigenvalues of σ_x are 1 and -1. So the eigenstates would satisfy (σ_x |psi> ) = ± |psi>.

So for the +1 eigenvalue, |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and for -1, |−x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Hmm, but wait, because σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when you apply it to |up> (which is [1,0]^T ), you get |down>. So the eigenstates are combinations that when you swap up and down, you get the same state. So yes, (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) is an eigenstate with eigenvalue 1, and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) with eigenvalue -1.

So the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |−x> as above.

Now, the state |alpha> can be expressed in terms of |+x> and |−x>. So to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate, we need to compute the overlap between |alpha> and each |+x> and |−x>.

But wait, let me write |+x> as (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |−x> as (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, to find the coefficients for |+x> and |−x> in |alpha>, we can write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |−x>.

Alternatively, the probability to measure the eigenvalue +a (where a is the eigenvalue for A) is the square of the amplitude when you project |alpha> onto the respective eigenstate.

So perhaps it's easier to compute these projections.

But wait, the operator A has eigenvalues ± (hbar/2), because A = (hbar/2) σ_x, and σ_x's eigenvalues are ±1. So the eigenvalues of A are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

So the problem is to find the probabilities of measuring +hbar/2 and -hbar/2, then find the average value of A.

So I need to project |alpha> onto each eigenstate of A.

Let me compute the components.

First, write |alpha> as:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Express this in terms of |+x> and |−x>.

Compute the coefficients c+ and c- such that |alpha> = c+ |+x> + c- |−x>.

Expressed as:

c+ = < +x | alpha >,

c- = < -x | alpha >.

So compute c+:

c+ = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] * (1/sqrt(2)) + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] * (1/sqrt(2)).

Because |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), so the inner product is (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) + (2 - i) ].

Wait, no: because < +x | up > is (1/sqrt(2)), and < +x | down > is (1/sqrt(2)).

So,

c+ = (1+i)/sqrt(7) * (1/sqrt(2)) + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) * (1/sqrt(2)).

Factor out 1/(sqrt(7)*sqrt(2)):

c+ = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(14)).

Simplify numerator: 1 + 2 = 3, i -i=0. So numerator is 3.

So c+ = 3 / sqrt(14).

Similarly, compute c-:

c- = < -x | alpha > = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] * (1/sqrt(2)) + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] * (-1/sqrt(2)).

Because < -x | up > is 1/sqrt(2), and < -x | down > is (-1)/sqrt(2).

So:

c- = (1+i) (1/sqrt(2)) - (2 - i)(1/sqrt(2)) all over sqrt(7).

Factor out sqrt(2) denominator:

c- = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(7)*sqrt(2)).

Compute numerator: 1-2 = -1, i + i= 2i. So numerator is (-1 +2i).

c- = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

Wait, because sqrt(7)*sqrt(2)=sqrt(14).

So, the coefficients are:

c+ = 3 / sqrt(14),

c- = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

Now, probabilities are |c+|² and |c-|².

Compute |c+|²: (3/sqrt(14))² = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is about 0.643, but let me compute exact fractions.

Wait, 9/14 is indeed about 0.642857.

Compute |c-|²: numerator is (-1 + 2i). The magnitude squared is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1 +4=5. So |c-|^2 = 5/14 ≈ 0.357142.

Wait, but 9/14 +5/14 =14/14=1, which checks out.

So the probabilities are approximately 9/14 and 5/14.

Wait, 9/14 is 0.642857, and 5/14 is approximately 0.357142. Now looking at the options, let me check.

Option A says 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7. Wait, 9/14 is 0.642857, which is about 0.64, and 5/14 is 0.357, which is about 0.36. So the probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36? But wait, 9/14 is 0.642857, so that would round to 0.64. 5/14 is 0.357, which is 0.36 when rounded. So the probabilities are around 0.64 and 0.36, which matches option A.

But let me double-check the calculation, because the other options have different numbers.

Wait, wait a second, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion. Let me recheck the coefficients.

Wait, |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, all over sqrt(7).

When I compute c+ and c-:

c+ is (1+i +2 -i) / (sqrt(7)*sqrt(2)) ).

Wait, 1+i +2 -i is 3. So c+ = 3/(sqrt(14)).

c- is (1+i - (2 -i)) / (sqrt(7)*sqrt(2)).

So numerator is 1 +i -2 +i = (-1 + 2i).

So, that part is correct. So |c+|^2 is 9/14, about 0.642857, and |c-|^2 is ( (-1)^2 +2^2 ) /14 = (1 +4)/14=5/14 ≈0.35714.

So, the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14.

But looking at the options, option A is 0.64, 0.36, which matches our probabilities. Now, what about the average value?

The average value of operator A is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A has eigenvalues hbar/2 and -hbar/2 with probabilities 9/14 and 5/14, the expectation value would be (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2).

Let me compute that:

= (9/14)(ħ/2) - (5/14)(ħ/2)

= ( (9 -5)/14 ) (ħ/2 )

= (4/14) (ħ/2 )

= (2/7) ( ħ/2 ) 

= (2 * ħ) / (14) )

= ħ/7.

So the average value is ħ/7.

So the probabilities are 9/14 (≈0.64) and 5/14 (≈0.36), and the average is ħ/7, which matches option A.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation of the average value. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it using the expectation value directly.

Another approach: since A is (ħ/2) σ_x, the expectation value is (ħ/2) times the expectation value of σ_x in state |alpha>.

The expectation value of σ_x is <alpha| σ_x |alpha>.

But σ_x in the computational basis is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So when we compute <alpha| σ_x |alpha>, that's the same as the inner product of |alpha> with σ_x |alpha>.

But perhaps it's easier to compute using the coefficients.

Wait, |alpha> is ( (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ) / sqrt(7).

So, <alpha| σ_x |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) ( (1-i) |<up| + (2+i) |<down| ) multiplied by σ_x ( (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ) / sqrt(7).

But σ_x |up> = |down>, and σ_x |down> = |up>.

So, σ_x |alpha> = (1+i) σ_x |up> + (2 -i) σ_x |down> ) / sqrt(7) = (1+i)|down> + (2 -i)|up> ) / sqrt(7).

So, <alpha| σ_x |alpha> = [ (1-i) <up| + (2+i) <down| ] * [ (1+i)|down> + (2 -i)|up> ) ] / 7.

Taking inner product:

= (1-i)( (2 -i) ) <up| up> + (1-i)( (1+i) ) <up| down>  + (2+i)( (2 -i) ) <down| down> + (2+i)( (1+i) ) <down| up>.

But <up| down> is 0. So the cross terms vanish.

So,

= [ (1-i)(2 -i) ) * 1 + (2+i)(2 -i) ) * 1 ] /7.

Compute each term:

First term: (1 -i)(2 -i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) -i*2 + i^2 = 2 -i -2i + (-1) = 2-3i -1 =1 -3i.

Wait, wait, let me compute it properly.

(1 - i)(2 - i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)(-i) = 2 -i -2i + i².

i² is -1, so 2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i.

Second term: (2+i)(2-i) = (2)^2 - (i)^2 =4 - (-1)=5.

So, sum is (1 -3i) +5 =6 -3i.

Wait, but wait, the cross terms were zero, so the total is (1 -3i +5)/7 = (6 -3i)/7.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because the expectation value of σ_x should be real because |alpha> is a valid quantum state and σ_x is Hermitian. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in expanding the terms.

Let me re-calculate the terms.

First term: (1-i)(2 -i) = (1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i) = 2 -i -2i + i².

i² is -1, so 2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i.

Second term: (2+i)(2-i) = (2)^2 - (i)^2 =4 - (-1) =5.

So the sum is (1 -3i) +5 =6 -3i.

So numerator is 6 -3i. Divided by 7, so (6-3i)/7.

Wait, but that's a complex number, which can't be the case because the expectation value should be real. So I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the setup. Let me try a different approach.

Alternatively, since the state |alpha> is written as a vector in the computational basis, we can express it as a vector in the basis of |up> and |down>. So |alpha> is a vector [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2-i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

The operator σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So σ_x |alpha> is [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7), (1+i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

The inner product <alpha| σ_x |alpha> is the conjugate transpose of |alpha> multiplied by σ_x |alpha>.

So, |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2-i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Conjugate transpose (bra) is [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2+i)/sqrt(7) ].

Multiply by σ_x |alpha> which is [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7), (1+i)/sqrt(7) ].

So the inner product is:

(1 -i)(2 -i) * (1/7) + (2 +i)(1 +i) * (1/7).

Compute each term:

First term: (1 -i)(2 -i).

=1*2 +1*(-i) -i*2 + (-i)(-i)
=2 -i -2i +i²
=2 -3i -1
=1 -3i.

Second term: (2 +i)(1 +i)
=2*1 +2*i +i*1 +i*i
=2 + 2i +i +i²
=2 +3i -1
=1 +3i.

So the sum is (1 -3i +1 +3i) /7 = 2/7.

So the expectation value of σ_x is 2/7.

So the average value of A is (ħ/2) * (2/7) ) = ħ/7.

Which matches the earlier calculation. So the average is ħ/7.

So the probabilities are 9/14 (~0.64) and 5/14 (~0.36), and the average is ħ/7. Looking at the options, option A has 0.64, 0.36, and ħ/7. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me check the probabilities again. The state |alpha> is expressed in terms of |+x> and |−x>, with coefficients c+ and c-. The probabilities are |c+|^2 and |c-|^2, which I found as 9/14 and 5/14. So yes, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, so 0.64 and 0.36.

So the correct option is A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The normalization factor is determined by summing the squared magnitudes of the coefficients:

\[
\text{Magnitude of } (1+i): \sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{2}, \quad \text{Magnitude of } (2-i): \sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{5}.
\]

The normalization factor is \( 1/\sqrt{7} \), so the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]

Next, we consider the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & \hbar/2 \\ \hbar/2 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This operator is proportional to the Pauli \( \sigma_x \) matrix, \( A = (\hbar/2) \sigma_x \), and its eigenstates are the eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \), which are:

\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle).
\]

The eigenvalues of \( A \) are \( \pm \hbar/2 \). To find the probabilities of measuring these eigenvalues, we project \( |\alpha\rangle \) onto \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \). The coefficients of \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) in \( |\alpha\rangle \) are:

\[
c_+ = \langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i) \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + (2-i) \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
c_- = \langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i) \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} - (2-i) \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these coefficients:

\[
P(+x) = |c_+|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(-x) = |c_-|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

Finally, the average value of \( A \) is calculated as:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \alpha | \sigma_x | \alpha \rangle.
\]

Using the expectation value of \( \sigma_x \), \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{2}{7} \), we find:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Thus, the probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value of \( A \) is \( \hbar/7 \). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
