Okay, so I've got this question about isomers and some specific compounds. I'm a bit rusty on my chemistry, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question has two parts: A and B. Let me tackle them one by one.

Part A: Which compound does not show tautomerism among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Hmm, tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and adjacent electrons, resulting in a structural isomer. It's like keto-enol tautomerism in ketones and aldehydes. So, the compound without tautomerism would be the one that can't undergo such a shift.

Benzoquinone: I think benzoquinone is an aromatic compound with two ketone groups. Wait, no, benzoquinone is a cyclic diene with two ketone groups. Or wait, quinones are cyclic compounds with two ketone groups. So benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups at positions 1 and 4, maybe? Or perhaps positions 1,2,3,4? No, benzoquinone is usually 1,4-diketone. So, structure is O=C6H4=O, but wait, no, benzoquinone is actually a six-membered ring with two ketone groups. Oh wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, benzoquinone could refer to 1,4-benzoquinone, which has two ketone groups on opposite positions of the benzene ring.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: That's a six-membered cyclohexane ring with three ketone groups. So, the ring is numbered 1,2,3,4,5,6; ketones are at positions 1,3,5. So, every other carbon has a ketone group. So the structure is O=C-O-C-O-C-O-C-O? No, wait, for cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each of those positions is a carbonyl group. So it's a cyclohexane ring with three ketone groups at 1,3,5 positions.

Now, tautomerism. Let's think about each compound.

Benzoquinone: If it's a 1,4-benzoquinone, the structure is O=C6H4=O. Wait, no, that's not right. Benzoquinone is actually an aromatic ring with two ketone groups. So, it's a conjugated di-ketone. But wait, can it undergo tautomerism? For tautomerism, you need a hydrogen alpha to a carbonyl group. But in benzoquinone, each ketone is at the 1 and 4 positions. The adjacent carbons are part of the benzene ring. But wait, the benzene ring is already conjugated, so maybe the alpha positions are on the ring and can't easily tautomerize. Alternatively, perhaps in some cases, the di-ketone can't tautomerize because the positions are too far apart. Or maybe the structure doesn't allow the necessary hydrogen shift for tautomerism. Alternatively, perhaps benzoquinone doesn't have any alpha hydrogens, which is necessary for tautomerism. Let me think.

Wait, in benzoquinone, each ketone is on the benzene ring. So, the structure is O=C-C6H4-C=O, but that can't be right because the ring would have two ketone groups. So, the structure is more like O=C-C6H2-C=O. Wait, no. Benzoquinone is C6H4O2 with two ketone groups. So, the carbons where the ketones are attached are each connected to two benzene carbons.

Wait, but the carbonyl carbons in benzoquinone are attached to the benzene ring. So those carbons (the carbonyl carbons) don't have any alpha hydrogens, because the adjacent carbons are part of the aromatic ring. Therefore, they can't undergo keto-enol tautomerism because there are no hydrogens on the adjacent carbons. So benzoquinone cannot undergo tautomerism.

On the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketones. So, each ketone is on a carbon that is adjacent to two other ketones? Wait, no, the positions are 1,3,5 on the cyclohexane ring. So each of those carbons is a carbonyl group. Let me think about the structure. So the ring is six-membered, and each odd-numbered carbon (1,3,5) is a carbonyl. Therefore, each of these carbonyl carbons is connected to two other carbons in the ring. So, for each carbonyl group, the adjacent carbons are CH2 groups? Or wait, the cyclohexane ring would have each of those positions as carbonyl, so:

O=C-O-C-O-C-O-C-O? No, I think I'm getting this wrong. It's a six-membered ring, with each alternate carbon being a carbonyl. So, the carbons at 1,3,5 are carbonyls, and the 2,4,6 are CH2 or CH groups? Wait, the structure is such that each of the 1,3,5 positions has a ketone group. So each of those is a carbonyl group connected to two other carbons in the ring.

But, do the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups have hydrogens? Let's see: in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each carbonyl is at 1,3,5. The adjacent carbons (positions 2, 6 for 1; 4, 2 for 3; 6,4 for 5) are each CH2 groups. So, each carbonyl is adjacent to CH2 groups. Therefore, those adjacent carbons have hydrogens (alpha hydrogens) which are acidic because of the electron-withdrawing effect of the carbonyl groups.

So, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the alpha positions (the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups) have hydrogens which can participate in tautomerism. So, the compound can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. 

Wait, but wait. In a cyclic compound with multiple ketones, like 1,3,5-trione, can the enol form exist? Because the ring is conjugated, the enol form might be possible. So, for example, a hydrogen from a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl can shift, leading to an enol form. So, this compound can undergo tautomerism.

So, part A is about which compound does NOT show tautomerism. Benzoquinone doesn't have any alpha hydrogens because the adjacent carbons are part of the aromatic ring and don't have hydrogens. So, benzoquinone can't tautomerize. Therefore, A is the compound that does not show tautomerism, which is benzoquinone.

Wait, wait. Wait, wait. Let me double-check. Benzoquinone is O=C6H4=O (but that's actually 1,4-benzoquinone). So, each ketone is on a benzene ring. The carbonyl carbons are attached to two benzene carbons. So, the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O and connected to two aryl (benzene) carbons. So, the adjacent carbons are part of the benzene ring, which is a conjugated system. Therefore, those adjacent carbons are spÂ² hybridized and don't have any hydrogens attached because in the benzene ring, each carbon is bonded to three others and one substituent (like the ketone). So, each of these carbonyl carbons in benzoquinone is attached to two other ring carbons, but those ring carbons don't have any hydrogens. Therefore, the alpha positions (the carbons next to the carbonyl) don't have hydrogens. Hence, no tautomerism possible. So, benzoquinone can't tautomerize, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can. Therefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism is benzoquinone. So, part A is A = benzoquinone.

Part B: Between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which one shows optical isomerism.

Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center, which is a carbon atom attached to four different groups. Alternatively, it can occur in other cases like allenes with restricted rotation, but I think the key is whether the molecule has a chiral center.

Let's consider each compound.

First, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. That's the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CHOH

Wait, wait, no. Let's think. The formula for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-C(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be HOCH2CH2COOH. Wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon. So structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. But wait, that's 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: structure is CH3-CHOH-COOH? Wait, no, wait. Wait, propane has three carbons. So propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? No, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the OH on the second carbon: CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Wait, but that would be butanoic acid. Wait, no, let me get this right.

Wait, the formula for 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOCH2CH2COOH? No, wait, that's 3-hydroxy. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me number the propanoic acid. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So the three carbons are:

1: COOH
2: CH2
3: CH3

Wait, that can't be. Actually, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? Wait, no, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So the chain is CH3-CH2-COOH. So the three carbons are:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: COOH

So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH3-CH(OH)-COOH. So when you make the ester, it becomes methyl ester. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, looking at the structure: the central carbon (the one attached to OH) is connected to:

- CH3 (from the CH(CH3))
- OH
- COOCH3 (from the carboxylic ester)
- and another CH2 group? Wait no, wait. Let me draw it properly.

Wait, the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- CH3 (from the left)
- OH
- COOCH3 (from the right)
- and the other side is a CH2 group? No, wait. Wait, that central CH is connected to:

Wait, no. The structure is:

The central carbon is the middle one in the chain. So:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH(OH)
Carbon 3: COOCH3

Wait, but that can't be. Because the formula would be CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (carbon 2) is connected to:

- CH3 (carbon 1)
- OH
- COOCH3 (carbon 3)
- and a single bond to another carbon? Wait, no, carbon 2 is a CH, so it's connected to three groups: CH3, OH, and COOCH3, but wait, that's only three. Oh wait, no, wait. The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the CH(OH) has:

- Two CH3 groups? No, wait. Let me think again. The structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH(OH)
Carbon 3: COOCH3

So, Carbon 2 is connected to:

- Carbon 1 (CH3)
- Carbon 3 (COOCH3)
- OH
- And what else? Oh, wait, each carbon in the chain has four bonds. So, the central carbon (Carbon 2) is CH(OH), which would have three substituents: CH3, COOCH3, and OH. But that's only three, so the fourth is a hydrogen? Wait, no, wait. The structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So, each of the carbons:

Carbon 1: CH3 (so three H's attached)

Carbon 2: CHO (but wait, it's CH(OH)).

Wait, perhaps I should write it as CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (Carbon 2) is connected to:

- CH3 (Carbon 1)
- COOCH3 (Carbon 3)
- OH
- and a hydrogen.

Wait, no. If it's CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon (Carbon 2) has four bonds: to CH3, COOCH3, OH, and another H? Or is it maybe CH3-CHOH-COOCH3, making Carbon 2 have a double bond? No, that would be an enol structure, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the ester structure. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is formed from 2-hydroxypropanoic acid and methanol. So the structure is:

The acid: HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3 (no, wait, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoic acid as CH3-CH(OH)-COOH). Wait, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Wait, that would have the OH on the second carbon. So, structure is:

Carbon 1: COOH
Carbon 2: CH2(OH)
Carbon 3: CH3?

Wait, that's possible. So the structure would be CH3-CH(OH)-COOH. Then, the ester would be CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

In this structure, the central carbon (Carbon 2) is attached to:

- CH3 (left)
- COOCH3 (right)
- OH
- and another CH2 group? Wait, no. Wait, in the structure CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, the central carbon is connected to:

- CH3 (from the left)
- COOCH3 (from the right)
- OH
- and a hydrogen (since it's a CH group).

Wait, no, no. Wait, each carbon in CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3: the central carbon is CH, so it has four bonds. Let's see:

- One bond to CH3 (left)
- One bond to OH
- One bond to COOCH3 (right)
- One bond to another carbon? No, because CH3 is on one side, and the rest is on the other. So perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me think of this as:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (CH) has:

- Left: CH3
- Middle: OH
- Right: COOCH3
- And the fourth bond is a single bond to another carbon? No, that can't be. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Maybe the correct structure is:

The acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH, so the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

In this case, the central carbon (the CH2 group) is connected to:

- CH2(OH)
- CH2COOCH3
- Two hydrogens.

Wait, so the central carbon is CH2. So each carbon in that CH2 group is attached to two hydrogens. So, the central carbon is not a chiral center because it's attached to two identical groups (two H's). So, in this case, the compound methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would have no chiral centers because the central carbon isn't connected to four different groups.

Wait, but wait. Let me re-express the structure. For methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon is attached to:

- CH3 (from one side)
- COOCH3 (from the other)
- OH
- and a hydrogen.

So, that's four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. Therefore, that carbon is a chiral center. So, the molecule can have optical isomerism. So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and would exhibit optical isomerism.

Now, the second compound: dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the di-ester of maleic acid. Maleic acid is (Z)-butenedioic acid. So, fumarate would have the structure where the two carboxylic acid groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

So, dimethyl fumarate would be (Z)-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. The structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no. Wait, fumarate is the trans isomer of maleic acid. So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid. So, the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a double bond between the two middle carbons. So, it's HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. The dimethyl ester would replace the -OH of each COOH with OCH3. So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, fumaric acid is E-isomer: O=C(OH)-CH2-CH2-C(OH)=O, but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. No, wait, fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH, which is the trans (E) isomer of maleic acid.

So, dimethyl fumarate would be O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(=O)OCH3. So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no. No, the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(=O)OCH3 but with a double bond. So, it's actually O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(=O)OCH3. Now, looking at this structure, the central two carbons are connected by a double bond. So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, because the double bond is between the two CH groups. So, the structure is:

CH2=C(CO2Me)-CH2(CO2Me)

Wait, no. Alternatively, the correct structure is:

O
|
O-C-OCH3
|
C=CH
|
O
|
O-C-OCH3

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw it as:

O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(=O)OCH3, but that's not correct because fumarate has a double bond.

Wait, fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. So, correct structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no. I think the correct structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(=O)OCH3. So, the central part is a double bond between the two CH groups.

So, the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(=O)OCH3.

In this case, the molecule is a diester with a double bond in the middle. Now, for optical isomerism, the molecule must have a chiral center or some other form of asymmetry, like in allenes with restricted rotation.

In dimethyl fumarate, the central double bond is between two CH groups. Each of those CH groups is attached to two ester groups (O-CO-OCH3). So, the structure is symmetrical. Because the substituents on either side of the double bond are the same, there's no chirality. So, the molecule doesn't have a chiral center, and because the double bond is between two identical groups, it doesn't have any E/Z isomerism that leads to optical activity. Alternatively, wait, no. Because the substituents on each side of the double bond are the same, so it's symmetric, so the molecule is not chiral.

Wait, let me think. The molecule is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(=O)OCH3 but that's without a double bond. No, wait, dimethyl fumarate has the double bond, so the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(=O)OCH3. So, each CH is connected to one ester group and the double bond. So, the two CH groups are each connected to an O=C-OCH3 group and each has two H's attached. So, each CH is identical, meaning that the molecule is symmetric across the double bond? No, wait, because each CH is connected to an ester group. So, the substituents on each side of the double bond are the same. Therefore, the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers and is not chiral because it's symmetrical. So, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. In dimethyl fumarate, the two substituents on each carbon of the double bond are the same. So, each double bond carbon is connected to one O=C-OCH3 group and two H's. So, the structure is symmetric. So, the molecule is not chiral. Therefore, it doesn't show optical isomerism.

So, between the two compounds: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center (so it shows optical isomerism), while dimethyl fumarate does not (it's symmetrical, so no optical isomerism).

Wait, no! Wait a minute. Dimethyl fumarate has the structure O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(=O)OCH3. So, each CH is connected to two H's and one O=C-OCH3 group. So, the molecule is symmetric across the double bond. Therefore, it doesn't have any chiral centers or any other form of asymmetry, so it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

But wait, I'm getting confused because sometimes when there's a double bond, especially in allenes, if the substituents are different, there can be stereochemistry. But in this case, the substituents on each end are the same. So, dimethyl fumarate is a trans (E) isomer, but since both substituents on each end are the same, it's not a chiral compound. So, it doesn't have optical isomerism.

On the other hand, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, so it does show optical isomerism.

So, for part B, the compound that shows optical isomerism is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, but wait, what about dimethyl fumarate? Could it have any other form of chirality? For example, if the double bond has substituents in a way that creates a plane of symmetry. Since each side is the same, the molecule is symmetrical and thus not chiral. So, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Therefore, for part B, the correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, but let me double-check the structures once more. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. So, four different groups â chiral center â optical isomerism.

Dimethyl fumarate: O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(=O)OCH3. Each CH is attached to an O=C-OCH3, two H's, and the double bond. So, each CH is CH2? No, wait, each CH is CH (since double bond is C=C). Wait, no, each is connected to two substituents. So, each double bond carbon is connected to one O=C-OCH3 and two H's. So, each CH is identical. Therefore, the molecule is symmetrical, so no optical isomerism.

Therefore, the correct answer is B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, but looking back at the options, let me check.

The options are:

A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

B) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

C) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate

D) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate

Wait, according to our analysis, part A is benzoquinone (A = benzoquinone), and part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So, looking at the options, option B (option B in the options) is A=benzoquinone and B=methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Therefore, the correct answer is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the correct answer, we analyze the two parts of the question:

### Part A: Which compound does not show tautomerism?
- **Benzoquinone**: This is a benzene ring with two ketone groups at positions 1 and 4. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the aromatic ring and do not have alpha hydrogens. Without alpha hydrogens, tautomerism is not possible.
- **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound has three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5 on a cyclohexane ring. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups have alpha hydrogens, allowing for keto-enol tautomerism.

Thus, **benzoquinone** does not show tautomerism.

### Part B: Which compound shows optical isomerism?
- **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CHâ-CH(OH)-COOCHâ. The central carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to four different groups: CHâ, COOCHâ, OH, and H. This makes it a chiral center, and the compound exhibits optical isomerism.
- **Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure is O=C(OCHâ)-CH=CH-C(=O)OCHâ. The molecule is symmetrical across the double bond, with identical substituents on either side. This symmetry prevents the formation of a chiral center, and the compound does not exhibit optical isomerism.

Thus, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** shows optical isomerism.

### Final Answer:
From the analysis:
- Part A: Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.
- Part B: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.

The correct option is **B**: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Answer: B

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this question about isomers and some specific compounds. I'm a bit rusty on my chemistry, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question has two parts: A and B. Let me tackle them one by one.

Part A: Which compound does not show tautomerism among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Hmm, tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and adjacent electrons, resulting in a structural isomer. It's like keto-enol tautomerism in ketones and aldehydes. So, the compound without tautomerism would be the one that can't undergo such a shift.

Benzoquinone: I think benzoquinone is an aromatic compound with two ketone groups. Wait, no, benzoquinone is a cyclic diene with two ketone groups. Or wait, quinones are cyclic compounds with two ketone groups. So benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups at positions 1 and 4, maybe? Or perhaps positions 1,2,3,4? No, benzoquinone is usually 1,4-diketone. So, structure is O=C6H4=O, but wait, no, benzoquinone is actually a six-membered ring with two ketone groups. Oh wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, benzoquinone could refer to 1,4-benzoquinone, which has two ketone groups on opposite positions of the benzene ring.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: That's a six-membered cyclohexane ring with three ketone groups. So, the ring is numbered 1,2,3,4,5,6; ketones are at positions 1,3,5. So, every other carbon has a ketone group. So the structure is O=C-O-C-O-C-O-C-O? No, wait, for cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each of those positions is a carbonyl group. So it's a cyclohexane ring with three ketone groups at 1,3,5 positions.

Now, tautomerism. Let's think about each compound.

Benzoquinone: If it's a 1,4-benzoquinone, the structure is O=C6H4=O. Wait, no, that's not right. Benzoquinone is actually an aromatic ring with two ketone groups. So, it's a conjugated di-ketone. But wait, can it undergo tautomerism? For tautomerism, you need a hydrogen alpha to a carbonyl group. But in benzoquinone, each ketone is at the 1 and 4 positions. The adjacent carbons are part of the benzene ring. But wait, the benzene ring is already conjugated, so maybe the alpha positions are on the ring and can't easily tautomerize. Alternatively, perhaps in some cases, the di-ketone can't tautomerize because the positions are too far apart. Or maybe the structure doesn't allow the necessary hydrogen shift for tautomerism. Alternatively, perhaps benzoquinone doesn't have any alpha hydrogens, which is necessary for tautomerism. Let me think.

Wait, in benzoquinone, each ketone is on the benzene ring. So, the structure is O=C-C6H4-C=O, but that can't be right because the ring would have two ketone groups. So, the structure is more like O=C-C6H2-C=O. Wait, no. Benzoquinone is C6H4O2 with two ketone groups. So, the carbons where the ketones are attached are each connected to two benzene carbons.

Wait, but the carbonyl carbons in benzoquinone are attached to the benzene ring. So those carbons (the carbonyl carbons) don't have any alpha hydrogens, because the adjacent carbons are part of the aromatic ring. Therefore, they can't undergo keto-enol tautomerism because there are no hydrogens on the adjacent carbons. So benzoquinone cannot undergo tautomerism.

On the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketones. So, each ketone is on a carbon that is adjacent to two other ketones? Wait, no, the positions are 1,3,5 on the cyclohexane ring. So each of those carbons is a carbonyl group. Let me think about the structure. So the ring is six-membered, and each odd-numbered carbon (1,3,5) is a carbonyl. Therefore, each of these carbonyl carbons is connected to two other carbons in the ring. So, for each carbonyl group, the adjacent carbons are CH2 groups? Or wait, the cyclohexane ring would have each of those positions as carbonyl, so:

O=C-O-C-O-C-O-C-O? No, I think I'm getting this wrong. It's a six-membered ring, with each alternate carbon being a carbonyl. So, the carbons at 1,3,5 are carbonyls, and the 2,4,6 are CH2 or CH groups? Wait, the structure is such that each of the 1,3,5 positions has a ketone group. So each of those is a carbonyl group connected to two other carbons in the ring.

But, do the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups have hydrogens? Let's see: in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each carbonyl is at 1,3,5. The adjacent carbons (positions 2, 6 for 1; 4, 2 for 3; 6,4 for 5) are each CH2 groups. So, each carbonyl is adjacent to CH2 groups. Therefore, those adjacent carbons have hydrogens (alpha hydrogens) which are acidic because of the electron-withdrawing effect of the carbonyl groups.

So, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the alpha positions (the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups) have hydrogens which can participate in tautomerism. So, the compound can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. 

Wait, but wait. In a cyclic compound with multiple ketones, like 1,3,5-trione, can the enol form exist? Because the ring is conjugated, the enol form might be possible. So, for example, a hydrogen from a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl can shift, leading to an enol form. So, this compound can undergo tautomerism.

So, part A is about which compound does NOT show tautomerism. Benzoquinone doesn't have any alpha hydrogens because the adjacent carbons are part of the aromatic ring and don't have hydrogens. So, benzoquinone can't tautomerize. Therefore, A is the compound that does not show tautomerism, which is benzoquinone.

Wait, wait. Wait, wait. Let me double-check. Benzoquinone is O=C6H4=O (but that's actually 1,4-benzoquinone). So, each ketone is on a benzene ring. The carbonyl carbons are attached to two benzene carbons. So, the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O and connected to two aryl (benzene) carbons. So, the adjacent carbons are part of the benzene ring, which is a conjugated system. Therefore, those adjacent carbons are spÂ² hybridized and don't have any hydrogens attached because in the benzene ring, each carbon is bonded to three others and one substituent (like the ketone). So, each of these carbonyl carbons in benzoquinone is attached to two other ring carbons, but those ring carbons don't have any hydrogens. Therefore, the alpha positions (the carbons next to the carbonyl) don't have hydrogens. Hence, no tautomerism possible. So, benzoquinone can't tautomerize, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can. Therefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism is benzoquinone. So, part A is A = benzoquinone.

Part B: Between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which one shows optical isomerism.

Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center, which is a carbon atom attached to four different groups. Alternatively, it can occur in other cases like allenes with restricted rotation, but I think the key is whether the molecule has a chiral center.

Let's consider each compound.

First, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. That's the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CHOH

Wait, wait, no. Let's think. The formula for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-C(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be HOCH2CH2COOH. Wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon. So structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. But wait, that's 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: structure is CH3-CHOH-COOH? Wait, no, wait. Wait, propane has three carbons. So propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? No, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the OH on the second carbon: CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Wait, but that would be butanoic acid. Wait, no, let me get this right.

Wait, the formula for 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOCH2CH2COOH? No, wait, that's 3-hydroxy. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me number the propanoic acid. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So the three carbons are:

1: COOH
2: CH2
3: CH3

Wait, that can't be. Actually, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? Wait, no, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So the chain is CH3-CH2-COOH. So the three carbons are:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: COOH

So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH3-CH(OH)-COOH. So when you make the ester, it becomes methyl ester. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, looking at the structure: the central carbon (the one attached to OH) is connected to:

- CH3 (from the CH(CH3))
- OH
- COOCH3 (from the carboxylic ester)
- and another CH2 group? Wait no, wait. Let me draw it properly.

Wait, the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- CH3 (from the left)
- OH
- COOCH3 (from the right)
- and the other side is a CH2 group? No, wait. Wait, that central CH is connected to:

Wait, no. The structure is:

The central carbon is the middle one in the chain. So:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH(OH)
Carbon 3: COOCH3

Wait, but that can't be. Because the formula would be CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (carbon 2) is connected to:

- CH3 (carbon 1)
- OH
- COOCH3 (carbon 3)
- and a single bond to another carbon? Wait, no, carbon 2 is a CH, so it's connected to three groups: CH3, OH, and COOCH3, but wait, that's only three. Oh wait, no, wait. The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the CH(OH) has:

- Two CH3 groups? No, wait. Let me think again. The structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH(OH)
Carbon 3: COOCH3

So, Carbon 2 is connected to:

- Carbon 1 (CH3)
- Carbon 3 (COOCH3)
- OH
- And what else? Oh, wait, each carbon in the chain has four bonds. So, the central carbon (Carbon 2) is CH(OH), which would have three substituents: CH3, COOCH3, and OH. But that's only three, so the fourth is a hydrogen? Wait, no, wait. The structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So, each of the carbons:

Carbon 1: CH3 (so three H's attached)

Carbon 2: CHO (but wait, it's CH(OH)).

Wait, perhaps I should write it as CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (Carbon 2) is connected to:

- CH3 (Carbon 1)
- COOCH3 (Carbon 3)
- OH
- and a hydrogen.

Wait, no. If it's CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon (Carbon 2) has four bonds: to CH3, COOCH3, OH, and another H? Or is it maybe CH3-CHOH-COOCH3, making Carbon 2 have a double bond? No, that would be an enol structure, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the ester structure. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is formed from 2-hydroxypropanoic acid and methanol. So the structure is:

The acid: HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3 (no, wait, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoic acid as CH3-CH(OH)-COOH). Wait, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Wait, that would have the OH on the second carbon. So, structure is:

Carbon 1: COOH
Carbon 2: CH2(OH)
Carbon 3: CH3?

Wait, that's possible. So the structure would be CH3-CH(OH)-COOH. Then, the ester would be CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

In this structure, the central carbon (Carbon 2) is attached to:

- CH3 (left)
- COOCH3 (right)
- OH
- and another CH2 group? Wait, no. Wait, in the structure CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, the central carbon is connected to:

- CH3 (from the left)
- COOCH3 (from the right)
- OH
- and a hydrogen (since it's a CH group).

Wait, no, no. Wait, each carbon in CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3: the central carbon is CH, so it has four bonds. Let's see:

- One bond to CH3 (left)
- One bond to OH
- One bond to COOCH3 (right)
- One bond to another carbon? No, because CH3 is on one side, and the rest is on the other. So perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me think of this as:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (CH) has:

- Left: CH3
- Middle: OH
- Right: COOCH3
- And the fourth bond is a single bond to another carbon? No, that can't be. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Maybe the correct structure is:

The acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH, so the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

In this case, the central carbon (the CH2 group) is connected to:

- CH2(OH)
- CH2COOCH3
- Two hydrogens.

Wait, so the central carbon is CH2. So each carbon in that CH2 group is attached to two hydrogens. So, the central carbon is not a chiral center because it's attached to two identical groups (two H's). So, in this case, the compound methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would have no chiral centers because the central carbon isn't connected to four different groups.

Wait, but wait. Let me re-express the structure. For methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon is attached to:

- CH3 (from one side)
- COOCH3 (from the other)
- OH
- and a hydrogen.

So, that's four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. Therefore, that carbon is a chiral center. So, the molecule can have optical isomerism. So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and would exhibit optical isomerism.

Now, the second compound: dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the di-ester of maleic acid. Maleic acid is (Z)-butenedioic acid. So, fumarate would have the structure where the two carboxylic acid groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

So, dimethyl fumarate would be (Z)-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. The structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no. Wait, fumarate is the trans isomer of maleic acid. So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid. So, the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a double bond between the two middle carbons. So, it's HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. The dimethyl ester would replace the -OH of each COOH with OCH3. So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, fumaric acid is E-isomer: O=C(OH)-CH2-CH2-C(OH)=O, but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. No, wait, fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH, which is the trans (E) isomer of maleic acid.

So, dimethyl fumarate would be O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(=O)OCH3. So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no. No, the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(=O)OCH3 but with a double bond. So, it's actually O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(=O)OCH3. Now, looking at this structure, the central two carbons are connected by a double bond. So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, because the double bond is between the two CH groups. So, the structure is:

CH2=C(CO2Me)-CH2(CO2Me)

Wait, no. Alternatively, the correct structure is:

O
|
O-C-OCH3
|
C=CH
|
O
|
O-C-OCH3

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw it as:

O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(=O)OCH3, but that's not correct because fumarate has a double bond.

Wait, fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. So, correct structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no. I think the correct structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(=O)OCH3. So, the central part is a double bond between the two CH groups.

So, the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(=O)OCH3.

In this case, the molecule is a diester with a double bond in the middle. Now, for optical isomerism, the molecule must have a chiral center or some other form of asymmetry, like in allenes with restricted rotation.

In dimethyl fumarate, the central double bond is between two CH groups. Each of those CH groups is attached to two ester groups (O-CO-OCH3). So, the structure is symmetrical. Because the substituents on either side of the double bond are the same, there's no chirality. So, the molecule doesn't have a chiral center, and because the double bond is between two identical groups, it doesn't have any E/Z isomerism that leads to optical activity. Alternatively, wait, no. Because the substituents on each side of the double bond are the same, so it's symmetric, so the molecule is not chiral.

Wait, let me think. The molecule is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(=O)OCH3 but that's without a double bond. No, wait, dimethyl fumarate has the double bond, so the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(=O)OCH3. So, each CH is connected to one ester group and the double bond. So, the two CH groups are each connected to an O=C-OCH3 group and each has two H's attached. So, each CH is identical, meaning that the molecule is symmetric across the double bond? No, wait, because each CH is connected to an ester group. So, the substituents on each side of the double bond are the same. Therefore, the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers and is not chiral because it's symmetrical. So, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. In dimethyl fumarate, the two substituents on each carbon of the double bond are the same. So, each double bond carbon is connected to one O=C-OCH3 group and two H's. So, the structure is symmetric. So, the molecule is not chiral. Therefore, it doesn't show optical isomerism.

So, between the two compounds: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center (so it shows optical isomerism), while dimethyl fumarate does not (it's symmetrical, so no optical isomerism).

Wait, no! Wait a minute. Dimethyl fumarate has the structure O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(=O)OCH3. So, each CH is connected to two H's and one O=C-OCH3 group. So, the molecule is symmetric across the double bond. Therefore, it doesn't have any chiral centers or any other form of asymmetry, so it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

But wait, I'm getting confused because sometimes when there's a double bond, especially in allenes, if the substituents are different, there can be stereochemistry. But in this case, the substituents on each end are the same. So, dimethyl fumarate is a trans (E) isomer, but since both substituents on each end are the same, it's not a chiral compound. So, it doesn't have optical isomerism.

On the other hand, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, so it does show optical isomerism.

So, for part B, the compound that shows optical isomerism is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, but wait, what about dimethyl fumarate? Could it have any other form of chirality? For example, if the double bond has substituents in a way that creates a plane of symmetry. Since each side is the same, the molecule is symmetrical and thus not chiral. So, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Therefore, for part B, the correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, but let me double-check the structures once more. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. So, four different groups â chiral center â optical isomerism.

Dimethyl fumarate: O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(=O)OCH3. Each CH is attached to an O=C-OCH3, two H's, and the double bond. So, each CH is CH2? No, wait, each CH is CH (since double bond is C=C). Wait, no, each is connected to two substituents. So, each double bond carbon is connected to one O=C-OCH3 and two H's. So, each CH is identical. Therefore, the molecule is symmetrical, so no optical isomerism.

Therefore, the correct answer is B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, but looking back at the options, let me check.

The options are:

A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

B) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

C) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate

D) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate

Wait, according to our analysis, part A is benzoquinone (A = benzoquinone), and part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So, looking at the options, option B (option B in the options) is A=benzoquinone and B=methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Therefore, the correct answer is option B.


To determine the correct answer, we analyze the two parts of the question:

### Part A: Which compound does not show tautomerism?
- **Benzoquinone**: This is a benzene ring with two ketone groups at positions 1 and 4. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the aromatic ring and do not have alpha hydrogens. Without alpha hydrogens, tautomerism is not possible.
- **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound has three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5 on a cyclohexane ring. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups have alpha hydrogens, allowing for keto-enol tautomerism.

Thus, **benzoquinone** does not show tautomerism.

### Part B: Which compound shows optical isomerism?
- **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CHâ-CH(OH)-COOCHâ. The central carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to four different groups: CHâ, COOCHâ, OH, and H. This makes it a chiral center, and the compound exhibits optical isomerism.
- **Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure is O=C(OCHâ)-CH=CH-C(=O)OCHâ. The molecule is symmetrical across the double bond, with identical substituents on either side. This symmetry prevents the formation of a chiral center, and the compound does not exhibit optical isomerism.

Thus, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** shows optical isomerism.

### Final Answer:
From the analysis:
- Part A: Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.
- Part B: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.

The correct option is **B**: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Answer: B
