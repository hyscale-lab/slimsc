Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read through it again and try to understand what's going on.

Alright, so the question is about a star that's similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K. Because of the spots, when the star rotates, the brightness changes, which could mimic the presence of an exoplanet. The question is asking what the radius of an exoplanet would need to be to produce the same brightness variation, assuming the star wasn't spotted.

Hmm. So, the main thing here is understanding how the star's brightness changes due to the spots and how that compares to the brightness dip caused by a planet transiting the star.

Let me think. When a star has spots, as it rotates, the spots come into and out of view from our perspective. Since the spots are cooler, the total brightness of the star dips slightly when they're facing us. This can look similar to a planet passing in front of the star, causing a dip in brightness as it blocks some light.

But wait, the problem says that the star's one hemisphere is covered 20% with spots. So each hemisphere is 50% of the star's surface, right? So the total area covered by spots is 20% of half the star's surface. Wait, no. Wait, the star's total surface area is 4πR². If one hemisphere (half the surface) is covered 20%, then the total area of the spots is 0.2 * (2πR²) )? Wait, no, each hemisphere is 2πR², so 20% of that is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So the spots cover 0.4πR² of the star's surface.

Wait, but the star's total surface area is 4πR², so the spots cover 0.4πR², which is 10% of the star's total surface. Hmm, but I'm not sure if I'm thinking about this correctly. Maybe the filling factor is 20%, which applies to the hemisphere—so in an individual hemisphere, 20% is spots and 80% is normal. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view, and the brightness dips because the spots are cooler.

The question is about how this dip compares to the dip caused by an exoplanet. So the amplitude of the brightness variation (the depth of the dip) caused by the spots should be the same as that caused by the planet.

So, the dip in brightness depends on the area of the spots and their temperature difference relative to the rest of the star.

Wait, no. Wait, the dip in brightness (the change in flux) is calculated as the difference between the star's normal flux and the flux when the spots are visible. But the spots are cooler, so when they are on the side facing us, they contribute less flux than they would if they were at the star's normal temperature.

Wait, but when the star is rotating, the spots change which part of the surface we see. The star emits more flux when the hotter parts are facing us, and less when the cooler spots are facing us.

So the total flux from the star changes as the spots rotate into view. Similarly, when a planet transits the star, the planet blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in flux.

So the question is: the amplitude of the dip caused by the spots is the same as the amplitude caused by the planet. So find Rplanet / Rstar that would cause the same dip.

So first, I need to find the fractional change in brightness caused by the spots, and then set that equal to the fractional change caused by the planet, then solve for Rplanet.

Let's model this.

First, the star's total flux without any spots would be F0 = 4πR² * σ * Teff^4 (but actually, the star emits over 4π steradians, but when observed, we see the entire disk. So the flux we receive is F0 = σ * Teff^4 * (π R²) / (distance²), but since we're dealing with relative changes, the distance might cancel out. Alternatively, perhaps think in terms of the star's total luminosity. Wait, no, because the spots affect the observed flux, so maybe it's better to model the flux as a function of the visible area.

Wait, the star's total flux without spots is F0 = σ T^4 * (R²) * π (since from Earth, we see the star's disk, which is a circle of area π R²). Hmm, wait, actually, the star emits in all directions, but the part we see is the surface facing us, which is a disk of area π R². So the flux from the star is F0 = (σ T^4) * (π R²) / D², where D is the distance. But when looking for relative changes, D² cancels out.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the star's flux as a sum of contributions from different regions. So, the normal star (without spots) has a flux F0 = σ T^4 * (π R²) / D².

When the star has spots, part of its surface is cooler. So when a spot is visible, it contributes less flux than the rest of the star.

Wait, but the problem says that the spots are on one hemisphere, and when the star rotates, that hemisphere comes into view. So when the star is at a certain phase (like when the spotty hemisphere is facing us), the observed flux is F = (normal flux) - (flux lost due to spots) + (flux from the spots, which is lower). Or, actually, the spots contribute less than the surrounding area.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model it as the star's flux when the spots are on the near side versus when they're on the far side.

Alternatively, think about the situation when the star is viewed such that the spotty hemisphere is the one facing us. In that case, the observed flux is the sum of the flux from the unspotted part of that hemisphere and the flux from the spotted part.

Wait, but the star is a sphere, so each hemisphere is 2π steradians as viewed from the center, but from Earth, we only see one hemisphere at a time. Wait, no, perhaps that's complicating it. Let me think again.

Wait, the star is being viewed from Earth. The star's surface is divided into two hemispheres: one that's currently facing us (the near side) and one that's on the far side. The near side is 50% of the star's surface. But in this scenario, one hemisphere (the near side) is covered with spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. So when that near side is facing us, 20% of its area is spots.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the star's surface is divided into two hemispheres, each 50% of the total surface. Each hemisphere is viewed from Earth when the star rotates. When the near side is the spotty one, then the observed flux is decreased because 20% of that hemisphere is cooler.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to calculate the average flux the star emits over a full rotation, but considering the spots. Since the spots are on one hemisphere, and the star is rotating such that the other hemisphere is spot-free when that side is facing us.

Wait, but the star has a rotation period, and as it rotates, the spots come into and out of view. So at any given time, either the spotty hemisphere or the non-spotty one is facing us.

Wait, but if the star is observed as it rotates, the brightness would vary when the spotty part comes into view. The maximum brightness is when the non-spotty hemisphere is facing us, and the minimum brightness is when the spotty hemisphere is facing us.

Wait, but the star's surface is a sphere. So when the near side is the spotty hemisphere, it's 20% covered in spots. So the area of the near side that's spots is 0.2 * (2π R^2) / 2? Wait, no. Wait, the area of a hemisphere is 2π R². So 20% of that hemisphere is spots: 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². But the total surface area of the star is 4π R². So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the area of spots visible is 0.4 π R², and the rest of the hemisphere (which is 1.6 π R²) is normal.

So the total flux when the spotty hemisphere is facing us is:

F_spotty = (normal area) * σ T^4 + (spot area) * σ (T - ΔT)^4

Wait, but the normal area is 1.6 π R², and the spot area is 0.4 π R². So:

F_spotty = (1.6 π R² σ T^4) + (0.4 π R² σ (T - ΔT)^4 )

But when the non-spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_non_spotty = 2 π R² σ T^4, because the entire hemisphere is at temperature T.

Wait, no. Wait, the non-spotty hemisphere is 100% normal, so when that hemisphere is facing us, the flux is 2 π R² σ T^4.

The question is to find the average brightness variation. But since the star is rotating, the brightness will vary between F_spotty and F_non_spotty, depending on which hemisphere is facing us.

So the maximum flux is F_non_spotty = 2 π R² σ T^4.

The minimum flux is F_spotty = 1.6 π R² σ T^4 + 0.4 π R² σ (T - 1000 K)^4.

Wait, wait, the problem states that the star's Teff is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. So the spot temperature is 5000 K.

So, the spot's contribution is 0.4 π R² * σ (5000)^4.

So the flux when the spotty hemisphere is facing us is:

F_spotty = (1.6 π R² σ (6000)^4) + (0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4 )

But when the other hemisphere is facing us, it's all 6000 K, so F_non_spotty = 2 π R² σ (6000)^4.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation (the dip) is the difference between F_non_spotty and F_spotty, divided by F_non_spotty.

So:

Amplitude = (F_non_spotty - F_spotty) / F_non_spotty.

Let me compute this.

First, compute F_non_spotty:

F_non_spotty = 2 π R² σ (6000)^4.

F_spotty = 1.6 π R² σ (6000)^4 + 0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4.

So F_spotty = [1.6*(6000)^4 + 0.4*(5000)^4] * π R² σ.

So the difference F_non_spotty - F_spotty is:

[2*(6000)^4 - (1.6*(6000)^4 + 0.4*(5000)^4)] * π R² σ.

Simplify inside the brackets:

2a - (1.6a + 0.4b) = 2a -1.6a -0.4b = 0.4a - 0.4b, where a= (6000)^4, b=(5000)^4.

So:

0.4 (a - b) = 0.4 (6000^4 - 5000^4).

So the amplitude is [0.4 (6000^4 - 5000^4) / (2 (6000^4))] ] * [π R² σ ] / [ π R² σ ] → the R² σ cancels, as does the π.

So amplitude = [0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4) ] / [2 *6000^4 ]

Simplify:

0.4 / 2 = 0.2. So 0.2 * (6000^4 -5000^4) / 6000^4.

Compute that.

Calculate (6000^4 -5000^4) /6000^4.

Let me compute 6000^4 first.

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 *1e12 = 1296e12 = 1.296e15.

5000^4 = (5e3)^4 = 625e12 = 6.25e14.

So 6000^4 -5000^4 = 1.296e15 - 0.625e15 = 0.671e15.

So (0.671e15) / (1.296e15) ≈ 0.671 /1.296 ≈ 0.5178.

Wait, let me compute 6000^4 and 5000^4 numerically.

Wait, 6000^4 = (6 *10^3)^4 = 6^4 *10^12 = 1296 *1e12 = 1.296e15.

5000^4 = (5e3)^4 = 625e12 = 6.25e14.

So 6000^4 -5000^4 = 1.296e15 - 0.625e15 = 0.671e15.

So the ratio is 0.671e15 /1.296e15 ≈ 0.5178.

So 0.2 * 0.5178 ≈ 0.10356, or about 10.356% amplitude.

Wait, but wait. The amplitude is the fractional change in brightness. So the dip when the spotty hemisphere is visible is about 10.356% of the non-spotty flux.

But that's the observed dip which we want to match with the dip caused by a planet.

When a planet transits the star, the dip is (area of planet / area of star) * (assuming the planet blocks part of the star's light, and the rest of the star is at the same temperature. So the dip is simply (R_planet / R_star)^2, since area scales with R².

Wait, the dip is (R_p / R_star)^2 because the area blocked is π R_p², and the star's area is π R_star². So the fractional area is (R_p/R_star)^2.

So, for the planet to cause the same amplitude, (R_p / R_star)^2 = amplitude from spots.

But wait, the spot amplitude is 0.10356 (approx 10.36%), so (R_p/R_star)^2 = 0.10356.

So R_p/R_star = sqrt(0.10356) ≈ 0.3218.

Wait, sqrt(0.1024) is 0.32 because 0.32^2=0.1024. 0.10356 is a bit higher, so sqrt would be about 0.322.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32, which is close.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because the numbers are critical.

Wait, the amplitude calculation: (F_non - F_spotty) / F_non.

Earlier, I thought of F_non as 2 π R² σ T^4, and F_spotty as 1.6 π R² σ T^4 + 0.4 π R² σ (T - ΔT)^4.

Wait, no. Wait, when the non-spotty hemisphere is facing us, the entire hemisphere is at T=6000 K, which is 2 π R² area. So F_non = 2 π R² σ (6000)^4.

When the spotty hemisphere is facing us, 20% of it is at 5000 K, so F_spotty = (0.8 * 2 π R²) * σ (6000)^4 + (0.2 * 2 π R²) * σ (5000)^4.

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because the hemisphere facing us is spotty; the 20% of that hemisphere is spots. So the area of the hemisphere is 2 π R², so 20% is 0.4 π R², as I thought before.

Wait, correction: when the star's spotty hemisphere is facing us, the near side is 2 π R². 20% of that (0.4 π R²) is spots, and 80% (1.6 π R²) is normal.

So F_spotty = 1.6 π R² σ (6000)^4 + 0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4.

F_non = 2 π R² σ (6000)^4.

So F_non - F_spotty = 2 π R² σ (6000^4) - [1.6 π R² σ 6000^4 + 0.4 π R² σ 5000^4].

= (2 -1.6) π R² σ 6000^4 - 0.4 π R² σ 5000^4.

= 0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 - 5000^4).

So the amplitude is (0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4) ) / (2 (6000^4)) ), because F_non is 2 π R² σ 6000^4.

So 0.4 / 2 = 0.2. So 0.2 * (6000^4 -5000^4) /6000^4.

Which is 0.2 * [1 - (5000/6000)^4 ].

Wait, because (6000^4 -5000^4)/6000^4 = 1 - (5000/6000)^4.

Compute (5/6)^4: (5/6)^4 = (625/1296) ≈ 0.482253.

So 1 - 0.482253 = 0.517747.

So 0.2 * 0.517747 ≈ 0.10355.

So the amplitude is about 0.10355, or 10.355%.

So the dip is about 10.355% in brightness.

Now, for the planet to cause the same dip, the dip would be (R_p / R_star)^2 ≈ 0.10355.

So R_p / R_star = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218 → approximately 0.32.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32.

Wait, but wait a second. The amplitude from the spots is when the star is rotating, and the spots come into view. So the dip in brightness is when the spots are on the near side.

But wait, the amplitude I calculated is the difference between the two states, so the dip is F_non - F_spotty, which is about 10% of F_non. So the dip is 10.355% of F_non.

Wait, but when the planet transits, the dip is (R_p / R_star)^2, which is (R_p/R_star)^2 = 0.10355 → R_p/R_star ≈ 0.3218.

So the answer would be approximately 0.32, which is option D.

But let me look back at the options.

Options:
A) ~0.39
B) ~0.07
C) ~0.11
D) ~0.32

Yes, D is correct.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star with spotted regions, we analyze the fractional change in brightness caused by the spots and equate it to the dip caused by the planet.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Star Properties**:  
   - The star has a radius equal to the Sun's radius, \( R_{\text{star}} \).  
   - The effective temperature is \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).  
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%, and the spots are cooler by \( \Delta T = 1000 \, \text{K} \), so their temperature is \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Flux Calculations**:  
   - When the non-spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is:  
     \[
     F_{\text{non-spotty}} = 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma (6000)^4
     \]  
   - When the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is:  
     \[
     F_{\text{spotty}} = (1.6 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma (6000)^4) + (0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma (5000)^4)
     \]  
     Here, 80% of the hemisphere is normal (\( 1.6 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \)) and 20% is cooler (\( 0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \)).

3. **Amplitude of Brightness Variation**:  
   The amplitude is the fractional change in brightness between the two states:  
   \[
   \text{Amplitude} = \frac{F_{\text{non-spotty}} - F_{\text{spotty}}}{F_{\text{non-spotty}}}
   \]  
   Substituting the flux expressions:  
   \[
   \text{Amplitude} = \frac{2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma (6000)^4 - \left[ 1.6 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma (6000)^4 + 0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma (5000)^4 \right]}{2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma (6000)^4}
   \]  
   Simplifying:  
   \[
   \text{Amplitude} = \frac{0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma \left( (6000)^4 - (5000)^4 \right)}{2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma (6000)^4}
   \]  
   Canceling terms:  
   \[
   \text{Amplitude} = \frac{0.4 \left( (6000)^4 - (5000)^4 \right)}{2 (6000)^4}
   \]  
   Compute \( (6000)^4 = 1.296 \times 10^{15} \) and \( (5000)^4 = 6.25 \times 10^{14} \):  
   \[
   \text{Amplitude} = \frac{0.4 \left( 1.296 \times 10^{15} - 6.25 \times 10^{14} \right)}{2 \times 1.296 \times 10^{15}}
   \]  
   \[
   \text{Amplitude} = \frac{0.4 \times 0.671 \times 10^{15}}{2 \times 1.296 \times 10^{15}}
   \]  
   \[
   \text{Amplitude} = \frac{0.2684 \times 10^{15}}{2.592 \times 10^{15}} \approx 0.10356 \, \text{(or 10.36%)}.
   \]

4. **Exoplanet Brightness Dip**:  
   The dip caused by a planet transiting the star is proportional to the square of the planet-to-star radius ratio:  
   \[
   \text{Amplitude} = \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2
   \]  
   Setting this equal to the amplitude from the spots:  
   \[
   \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.10356
   \]  
   Solving for \( R_{\text{planet}} / R_{\text{star}} \):  
   \[
   \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.10356} \approx 0.3218
   \]  
   This rounds to approximately \( 0.32 \).

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet, relative to the host star, is approximately **0.32**.
