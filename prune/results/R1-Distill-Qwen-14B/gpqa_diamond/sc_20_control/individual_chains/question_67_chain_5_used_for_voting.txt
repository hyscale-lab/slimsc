Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about two electrons in p orbitals. Let me read the question carefully.

The problem says we have two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. We're told to ignore their spin angular momentum. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. 

Wait, I need to remember what each of these quantum numbers represents. l1 and l2 are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for each electron. Since they are p orbitals, each has l=1. The total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, which makes sense because when you add two angular momenta l1=1 and l2=1, the possible total l values are 2,1,0. And m is the magnetic quantum number for the total angular momentum, which is -1 in this case.

The question asks about the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z to be -ħ. So each electron's orbital angular momentum in the z-direction is -ħ.

Hmm, I think I need to look at the state |1,1,2,-1> and see how the individual L1z and L2z contribute to this. 

Wait, I remember that for two particles, the coupled state can be expressed in terms of the product of individual states. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact expansion. Let's think about angular momentum coupling. The general approach is that the total angular momentum state can be written as a combination of the product states of the individual angular momenta.

In this case, each electron has l=1. The total angular momentum can be l=2, 1, or 0. But our state is |1,1,2,-1>, so it's the state with the maximum possible total angular momentum (since l=2 is the highest sum of 1+1).

Now, the individual states for each electron are |l1, m1> and |l2, m2>. So the possible m1 and m2 values for each electron are -1, 0, +1.

The coupled state |l=2, m=-1> would be a linear combination of all possible pairs of |m1, m2> such that m1 + m2 = m_total = -1.

So, for m_total = -1, the possible m1 and m2 combinations are:
- m1= -1, m2=0 → sum is -1
- m1=0, m2= -1 → sum is -1
Wait, but each of these would contribute to the state |1,1,2,-1>.

Wait, I think the state |1,1,2,-1> can be expressed as a sum of product states where m1 + m2 = -1. But what are the coefficients for each product state in this sum?

I remember that when combining two angular momenta, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are involved. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients describe how the product states combine into the coupled states.

For l1=1, l2=1, and total l=2, the state |2, -1> should be a combination of the product states where m1 + m2 = -1.

So, the product states contributing to |2, -1> are |1, m1> ⊗ |1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1.

The m1 and m2 pairs are:
m1=1, m2=-2 → Wait, no, since each m can only be -1, 0, +1. So m2 can't be -2. So possible pairs are:
m1 = -1, m2=0 → sum -1,
m1=0, m2=-1 → sum -1.

Wait, any other possibilities? Let me list all possible m1 and m2 pairs that add to -1:

( m1, m2 ) = ( -1, 0 ), ( 0, -1 ), ( 1, -2 ) → but m2 can't be -2 because l=1 → m ranges from -1 to 1. So only the first two pairs are possible.

Wait, let me double-check: When l=1, m can be -1, 0, +1. So m1 can be -1, 0, +1, same for m2.

So m1 + m2 = -1. Let's see:

m1 = -1 → m2 must be 0 → sum is -1+0 = -1.

m1 = 0 → m2 must be -1 → sum is 0 + (-1) = -1.

m1 = 1 → m2 must be -2 → but m2 can't be -2, so this is invalid.

So only two product states contribute: |1, -1> |1, 0> and |1, 0> |1, -1>.

Wait, but wait: the product states are |m1, m2>, so the first is | -1, 0 > and the second is |0, -1 >.

So the coupled state |2, -1> is a linear combination of these two product states. What are the coefficients?

In the case of coupling two angular momenta of l1=l2=1 to give total l=2, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients would determine the expansion.

Wait, I think for the state |2, m>, the expansion is:

|2, m> = sum_{m1 + m2 = m} [ Clebsch-Gordan coefficient ] |m1> |m2>

For m = -2: |1,1> and |1,1> → but that gives m=-2? No, m1 and m2 would both need to be -1. Because (-1) + (-1) = -2. So |2, -2> is |1,-1>|1,-1>.

For m = -1: the possible (m1, m2) pairs are ( -1, 0 ) and ( 0, -1 ). The coefficients for these two terms are sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) or something like that?

Wait, I might be getting this mixed up. Let me think again. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding two l=1 to get l=2.

I recall that for l=2, m=2: only (1,1) contributes.

For m=1: (1,0) and (0,1) with coefficients.

Wait, maybe I should look up the standard Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l1=1, l2=1, L=2.

Wait, from what I remember: 

The state |2,2> is |1,1>|1,1>.

The state |2,1> is sqrt(1/3) |1,1>|1,0> + sqrt(2/3) |1,0>|1,1>.

The state |2,0> is sqrt(1/6) [ |1,1>|1,-1> + |1,0>|1,0> + |1,-1>|1,1> ].

The state |2,-1> is sqrt(1/3) |1,-1>|1,0> + sqrt(2/3) |1,0>|1,-1>.

The state |2,-2> is |1,-1>|1,-1>.

Wait, that seems right. So for |2,-1>, the expansion is:

|2,-1> = sqrt(1/3) |m1=1, m2=-2> → wait, no, wait m2 can't be -2. Oh wait, no.

Wait, no. Wait for l=1, the m can only be -1, 0, +1. So when combining for |2, -1>, the possible m1 and m2 pairs must be such that m1 + m2 = -1. So m1 can be 0 and m2=-1, or m1=-1 and m2=0. 

Wait, looking back at what I thought earlier, perhaps I should correct that. 

Wait for |2, -1>, the expansion would involve |m1, m2> such that m1 + m2 = -1.

So the possible (m1, m2) are (0, -1) and (-1, 0).

So the state |2, -1> is a combination of |0, -1> (i.e., |1,0> ⊗ |1,-1>) and | -1, 0> (i.e., |1,-1> ⊗ |1,0>).

Wait, but what are the coefficients?

Hmm, from what I remember, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for L=2, m=-1 are:

|2, -1> = sqrt(1/3) |1, 0> |1, -1> + sqrt(2/3) |1, -1> |1, 0>.

Wait, not sure about the exact coefficients. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficients are equal. Let me think that through.

Wait, for the state |2,-1>, the expansion is:

|2, -1> = a |m1=0, m2=-1> + b |m1=-1, m2=0>.

We can find a and b.

But perhaps it's easier to consider that the coefficients are determined by the symmetry of the states.

Wait, the state |m1=0, m2=-1> is |1,0>|1,-1>, and |m1=-1, m2=0> is |1,-1>|1,0>.

Since the particles are indistinct (they're electrons), I think the state must be symmetric or antisymmetric under exchange, but wait, electrons are fermions, so the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange. However, in this case, we're only considering the orbital angular momentum part. The spin part would have to compensate for that, but the question says to ignore spin angular momentum. Hmm, but perhaps the angular momentum state alone isn't necessarily symmetric or antisymmetric.

Wait, but for two identical particles, the total state (including spin) must be antisymmetric. But since we're ignoring spin, perhaps the orbital part isn't restricted to symmetry. Hmm, but perhaps this consideration is beyond what's needed here.

Alternatively, perhaps the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for |2, m> are such that the coefficients are symmetric in a specific way. For example, for m=1, the coefficients for (1,0) and (0,1) are different. I think for |2,1>, the state is ( |1,1>|1,0> + |1,0>|1,1> ) multiplied by some normalization factor. But perhaps the coefficients are sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) or something like that.

Wait, perhaps I should remember that for two l=1 angular momenta, the possible total l are 2,1,0. The state |2,-1> is a combination of |1,0> and |1,-1> in both orders.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact form isn't crucial for this problem. Let's think about the possible outcomes.

We're being asked about the probability that both L1z and L2z are measured to be -ħ. That is, m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. Because L1z = m1 ħ and L2z = m2 ħ.

Wait, but in the coupled state |2,-1>, the possible m1 and m2 are such that m1 + m2 = -1. So if m1 = -1, then m2 must be 0. And if m2 = -1, then m1 must be 0. Therefore, in the state |2,-1>, there is no component where both m1 and m2 are -1. Because m1 + m2 would be -2, which corresponds to the |2,-2> state.

So in our given state |2,-1>, the possible m1 and m2 pairs are (0, -1) and (-1, 0). There's no ( -1, -1 ) pair.

Therefore, the probability of measuring both L1z and L2z as -ħ (i.e., both m1 and m2 being -1) is zero.

So looking back at the options, option D is 0.

The problem involves two electrons in p orbitals, with their orbital angular momentum quantum numbers described by the coupled state $|l_1, l_2, l, m\rangle = |1,1,2,-1\rangle$. Here, $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons, $l = 2$ is the total angular momentum quantum number, and $m = -1$ is the magnetic quantum number of the system. The task is to determine the joint probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$, which corresponds to $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Coupled State Expansion**: The coupled state $|2, -1\rangle$ can be expressed as a linear combination of product states $|m_1, m_2\rangle$ where $m_1 + m_2 = -1$. The possible pairs $(m_1, m_2)$ are:
   - $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, 0)$
   - $(m_1, m_2) = (0, -1)$

   These pairs contribute to the state $|2, -1\rangle$ with specific Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

2. **Measurement of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$**: Measuring $L_{1z} = -\hbar$ and $L_{2z} = -\hbar$ corresponds to $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. However, for the coupled state $|2, -1\rangle$, the condition $m_1 + m_2 = -1$ explicitly excludes the pair $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, -1)$, as this would give $m_1 + m_2 = -2$, which corresponds to the state $|2, -2\rangle$.

3. **Probability Calculation**: Since the state $|2, -1\rangle$ does not include any component where both $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$, the probability of measuring $L_{1z} = -\hbar$ and $L_{2z} = -\hbar$ is zero.

### Conclusion:
The joint probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$ is $0$.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about two electrons in p orbitals. Let me read the question carefully.

The problem says we have two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. We're told to ignore their spin angular momentum. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. 

Wait, I need to remember what each of these quantum numbers represents. l1 and l2 are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for each electron. Since they are p orbitals, each has l=1. The total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, which makes sense because when you add two angular momenta l1=1 and l2=1, the possible total l values are 2,1,0. And m is the magnetic quantum number for the total angular momentum, which is -1 in this case.

The question asks about the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z to be -ħ. So each electron's orbital angular momentum in the z-direction is -ħ.

Hmm, I think I need to look at the state |1,1,2,-1> and see how the individual L1z and L2z contribute to this. 

Wait, I remember that for two particles, the coupled state can be expressed in terms of the product of individual states. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact expansion. Let's think about angular momentum coupling. The general approach is that the total angular momentum state can be written as a combination of the product states of the individual angular momenta.

In this case, each electron has l=1. The total angular momentum can be l=2, 1, or 0. But our state is |1,1,2,-1>, so it's the state with the maximum possible total angular momentum (since l=2 is the highest sum of 1+1).

Now, the individual states for each electron are |l1, m1> and |l2, m2>. So the possible m1 and m2 values for each electron are -1, 0, +1.

The coupled state |l=2, m=-1> would be a linear combination of all possible pairs of |m1, m2> such that m1 + m2 = m_total = -1.

So, for m_total = -1, the possible m1 and m2 combinations are:
- m1= -1, m2=0 → sum is -1
- m1=0, m2= -1 → sum is -1
Wait, but each of these would contribute to the state |1,1,2,-1>.

Wait, I think the state |1,1,2,-1> can be expressed as a sum of product states where m1 + m2 = -1. But what are the coefficients for each product state in this sum?

I remember that when combining two angular momenta, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are involved. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients describe how the product states combine into the coupled states.

For l1=1, l2=1, and total l=2, the state |2, -1> should be a combination of the product states where m1 + m2 = -1.

So, the product states contributing to |2, -1> are |1, m1> ⊗ |1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1.

The m1 and m2 pairs are:
m1=1, m2=-2 → Wait, no, since each m can only be -1, 0, +1. So m2 can't be -2. So possible pairs are:
m1 = -1, m2=0 → sum -1,
m1=0, m2=-1 → sum -1.

Wait, any other possibilities? Let me list all possible m1 and m2 pairs that add to -1:

( m1, m2 ) = ( -1, 0 ), ( 0, -1 ), ( 1, -2 ) → but m2 can't be -2 because l=1 → m ranges from -1 to 1. So only the first two pairs are possible.

Wait, let me double-check: When l=1, m can be -1, 0, +1. So m1 can be -1, 0, +1, same for m2.

So m1 + m2 = -1. Let's see:

m1 = -1 → m2 must be 0 → sum is -1+0 = -1.

m1 = 0 → m2 must be -1 → sum is 0 + (-1) = -1.

m1 = 1 → m2 must be -2 → but m2 can't be -2, so this is invalid.

So only two product states contribute: |1, -1> |1, 0> and |1, 0> |1, -1>.

Wait, but wait: the product states are |m1, m2>, so the first is | -1, 0 > and the second is |0, -1 >.

So the coupled state |2, -1> is a linear combination of these two product states. What are the coefficients?

In the case of coupling two angular momenta of l1=l2=1 to give total l=2, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients would determine the expansion.

Wait, I think for the state |2, m>, the expansion is:

|2, m> = sum_{m1 + m2 = m} [ Clebsch-Gordan coefficient ] |m1> |m2>

For m = -2: |1,1> and |1,1> → but that gives m=-2? No, m1 and m2 would both need to be -1. Because (-1) + (-1) = -2. So |2, -2> is |1,-1>|1,-1>.

For m = -1: the possible (m1, m2) pairs are ( -1, 0 ) and ( 0, -1 ). The coefficients for these two terms are sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) or something like that?

Wait, I might be getting this mixed up. Let me think again. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding two l=1 to get l=2.

I recall that for l=2, m=2: only (1,1) contributes.

For m=1: (1,0) and (0,1) with coefficients.

Wait, maybe I should look up the standard Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l1=1, l2=1, L=2.

Wait, from what I remember: 

The state |2,2> is |1,1>|1,1>.

The state |2,1> is sqrt(1/3) |1,1>|1,0> + sqrt(2/3) |1,0>|1,1>.

The state |2,0> is sqrt(1/6) [ |1,1>|1,-1> + |1,0>|1,0> + |1,-1>|1,1> ].

The state |2,-1> is sqrt(1/3) |1,-1>|1,0> + sqrt(2/3) |1,0>|1,-1>.

The state |2,-2> is |1,-1>|1,-1>.

Wait, that seems right. So for |2,-1>, the expansion is:

|2,-1> = sqrt(1/3) |m1=1, m2=-2> → wait, no, wait m2 can't be -2. Oh wait, no.

Wait, no. Wait for l=1, the m can only be -1, 0, +1. So when combining for |2, -1>, the possible m1 and m2 pairs must be such that m1 + m2 = -1. So m1 can be 0 and m2=-1, or m1=-1 and m2=0. 

Wait, looking back at what I thought earlier, perhaps I should correct that. 

Wait for |2, -1>, the expansion would involve |m1, m2> such that m1 + m2 = -1.

So the possible (m1, m2) are (0, -1) and (-1, 0).

So the state |2, -1> is a combination of |0, -1> (i.e., |1,0> ⊗ |1,-1>) and | -1, 0> (i.e., |1,-1> ⊗ |1,0>).

Wait, but what are the coefficients?

Hmm, from what I remember, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for L=2, m=-1 are:

|2, -1> = sqrt(1/3) |1, 0> |1, -1> + sqrt(2/3) |1, -1> |1, 0>.

Wait, not sure about the exact coefficients. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficients are equal. Let me think that through.

Wait, for the state |2,-1>, the expansion is:

|2, -1> = a |m1=0, m2=-1> + b |m1=-1, m2=0>.

We can find a and b.

But perhaps it's easier to consider that the coefficients are determined by the symmetry of the states.

Wait, the state |m1=0, m2=-1> is |1,0>|1,-1>, and |m1=-1, m2=0> is |1,-1>|1,0>.

Since the particles are indistinct (they're electrons), I think the state must be symmetric or antisymmetric under exchange, but wait, electrons are fermions, so the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange. However, in this case, we're only considering the orbital angular momentum part. The spin part would have to compensate for that, but the question says to ignore spin angular momentum. Hmm, but perhaps the angular momentum state alone isn't necessarily symmetric or antisymmetric.

Wait, but for two identical particles, the total state (including spin) must be antisymmetric. But since we're ignoring spin, perhaps the orbital part isn't restricted to symmetry. Hmm, but perhaps this consideration is beyond what's needed here.

Alternatively, perhaps the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for |2, m> are such that the coefficients are symmetric in a specific way. For example, for m=1, the coefficients for (1,0) and (0,1) are different. I think for |2,1>, the state is ( |1,1>|1,0> + |1,0>|1,1> ) multiplied by some normalization factor. But perhaps the coefficients are sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) or something like that.

Wait, perhaps I should remember that for two l=1 angular momenta, the possible total l are 2,1,0. The state |2,-1> is a combination of |1,0> and |1,-1> in both orders.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact form isn't crucial for this problem. Let's think about the possible outcomes.

We're being asked about the probability that both L1z and L2z are measured to be -ħ. That is, m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. Because L1z = m1 ħ and L2z = m2 ħ.

Wait, but in the coupled state |2,-1>, the possible m1 and m2 are such that m1 + m2 = -1. So if m1 = -1, then m2 must be 0. And if m2 = -1, then m1 must be 0. Therefore, in the state |2,-1>, there is no component where both m1 and m2 are -1. Because m1 + m2 would be -2, which corresponds to the |2,-2> state.

So in our given state |2,-1>, the possible m1 and m2 pairs are (0, -1) and (-1, 0). There's no ( -1, -1 ) pair.

Therefore, the probability of measuring both L1z and L2z as -ħ (i.e., both m1 and m2 being -1) is zero.

So looking back at the options, option D is 0.


The problem involves two electrons in p orbitals, with their orbital angular momentum quantum numbers described by the coupled state $|l_1, l_2, l, m\rangle = |1,1,2,-1\rangle$. Here, $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons, $l = 2$ is the total angular momentum quantum number, and $m = -1$ is the magnetic quantum number of the system. The task is to determine the joint probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$, which corresponds to $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Coupled State Expansion**: The coupled state $|2, -1\rangle$ can be expressed as a linear combination of product states $|m_1, m_2\rangle$ where $m_1 + m_2 = -1$. The possible pairs $(m_1, m_2)$ are:
   - $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, 0)$
   - $(m_1, m_2) = (0, -1)$

   These pairs contribute to the state $|2, -1\rangle$ with specific Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

2. **Measurement of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$**: Measuring $L_{1z} = -\hbar$ and $L_{2z} = -\hbar$ corresponds to $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. However, for the coupled state $|2, -1\rangle$, the condition $m_1 + m_2 = -1$ explicitly excludes the pair $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, -1)$, as this would give $m_1 + m_2 = -2$, which corresponds to the state $|2, -2\rangle$.

3. **Probability Calculation**: Since the state $|2, -1\rangle$ does not include any component where both $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$, the probability of measuring $L_{1z} = -\hbar$ and $L_{2z} = -\hbar$ is zero.

### Conclusion:
The joint probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$ is $0$.
