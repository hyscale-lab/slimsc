Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again: The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of alkyl halides, but wait, no, waitâ€”red phosphorus is used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction maybe? Or is it for something else? Oh wait, no, wait. Red phosphorus and iodine are used in the hydroiodic acid formation. Oh right, the reaction of alkenes with red phosphorus and HI is for the hydrohalogenation, but wait, no, that's with HX. Or maybe it's a bromonium ring opening? Hmm, no.

Wait, wait. Let me think. Red phosphorus and excess HI is used for the hydrolysis of nitriles, or perhaps for the dehydration of alcohols? No, wait, I think I'm getting confused. Oh right, the reaction of alkenes with red phosphorus and HI is a way to add HI across the double bond, but wait, that's when you have alkenes. So are we dealing with an addition reaction here?

Wait, the starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let me draw its structure. So, cyclohexene ring. The substituents are at positions 2, 3, and 5. At position 2, there's a formyl group (CHO). At position 5, a vinyl group (CH2CH2, but actually CH2=CH- since it's vinyl). And the ring has a double bond at position 3, so cyclohex-3-ene. So the ring has two double bonds? Wait, no. Wait, cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid means the ring has a double bond between carbons 3 and 4, perhaps, and a carboxylic acid group at position 3? Wait, no. Wait, the numbering might be different. Let me try to imagine the structure.

Positioning on a cyclohexene ring: position 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. The carboxylic acid is at position 3? Or wait, the name is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the main chain is cyclohexene, and substituents are at 2 and 5 positions. The -COOH is at position 3. Because the suffix is 'carboxylic acid', so that would be the functional group at the 3 position. So the structure would have a double bond between carbons 3 and 4, I think. So the ring is cyclohexene with substituents: at 2, a formyl group (CHO), at 3, a COOH group, and at 5, a vinyl group (which is CH2CH2 but as an ethenyl, so CH2=CH- attached perhaps to position 5.

Wait, but if the ring is cyclohex-3-ene, then the double bond is between C3 and C4. So the substituents are at positions 2 (CHO), 3 (COOH), 5 (vinyl). So the structure is a cyclohexene ring with substituents at 2, 3, and 5. Let me try to imagine that.

Now, the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. I think this is a reaction where the double bonds are being opened. Wait, but wait: when you have a diene, or multiple double bonds, reacting with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps it's a dihydroxylation or some kind of addition. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a hydrohalogenation. But with excess HI, perhaps adding across the double bonds. But wait, in the presence of red phosphorus, maybe it's a different reaction. Oh wait, red phosphorus and HI is used in the Hofmann elimination maybe? No, Hofmann is for amines. Alternatively, red phosphorus is used in the Birch reduction? No, that's for aromatic rings.

Wait, I think I remember that when alkenes are treated with HI and red phosphorus, it's a way to do a hydrohalogenation, perhaps forming a vicinal dihalide. Wait, no, more accurately, I think that when an alkene reacts with HI in the presence of red phosphorus, it's a reaction called hydrohalogenation. Or wait, perhaps it's the formation of a diiodide. Let me think: HI is a strong acid, and in presence of red phosphorus, perhaps it generates H+ and I-? Or maybe the red phosphorus is part of the acid catalyst.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is adding HI across the double bond. So, if the starting molecule has a double bond in the ring (the cyclohexene part) and another double bond in the vinyl group (CH2=CH-), then reacting with HI would add iodide across each of those double bonds.

Wait, but the starting molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So, in the ring, there's a double bond between C3 and C4. Then, the substituent at C5 is a vinyl group (CH2=CH-). So, the molecule has two double bonds: one in the ring (cyclohexene) and one in the vinyl group.

So when we react this with red phosphorus and excess HI, perhaps each double bond will undergo addition. Red phosphorus and HI are a classic way to add HI across a double bond. For each double bond, the reaction would add two iodine atoms? Or perhaps each double bond would add one H and one I.

Wait, maybe each double bond would add HI across, leading to vicinal diiodides. Wait, but let me think. Normally, when you have an alkene reacting with HI, it undergoes an addition reaction, typically following a mechanism where the H adds to one carbon and I to the other, leading to a diiodide. But in the presence of red phosphorus, perhaps it's a different pathway. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more about the dehydrohalogenation, but no, that's elimination.

Wait, another approach: the index of hydrogen deficiency is the number of rings plus the number of double bonds plus the number of triple bonds, etc., minus one for each. Wait, no, the index is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2, where C is the number of carbons, H is hydrogens, X is halogens, N is nitrogens. Or wait, the formula is Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = [2C +2 - H - X + N]/2. So, each DoU is a ring or a double bond or a triple bond (each triple counts as two, etc.).

So, the product's DoU is what we're being asked. So, perhaps the reaction modifies the number of rings and double bonds in the molecule.

So, the starting material: let's count its DoU. Let's see, the starting compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

Breaking it down:

The cyclohexene ring is a six-membered ring with one double bond. So, that's 1 ring (which counts as one DoU) plus the double bond (another DoU), totaling 2. Plus, the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) has another double bond, adding another DoU. Additionally, the formyl group (CHO) is just a carbonyl, which is a double bond, adding another DoU. So, let's count:

- Cyclohexene ring: 6 carbons, 1 ring (DoU +1), 1 double bond (DoU +1). So cyclohexene ring contributes 2 DoU.
- The vinyl group: a double bond, DoU +1.
- The formyl group: a carbonyl, DoU +1.
So in total, DoU is 2 (from ring) + 1 (vinyl) +1 (formyl) = 4? Wait, but wait, I'm not sure. Let me recount.

Wait, the cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with one double bond. So, rings and double bonds each contribute one DoU. For a cyclohexene, it's one ring (DoU +1) and one double bond (DoU +1) => 2 DoU.

The substituents:

- At position 2: formyl (CHO) group. That's a carbonyl, which is a double bond. So that's +1 DoU.
- At position 5: vinyl group (CH2=CH-). That's another double bond, +1 DoU.
- At position 3: the carboxylic acid (COOH). The COOH group has a carbonyl, which is a double bond, so that's another DoU.

So, total DoU would be:

Cyclohexene: 2.

Formyl: 1.

Vinyl: 1.

COOH: 1.

Total = 5 DoU.

Wait, but wait: the COOH group is part of the cyclohexene ring. Because the name is cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, so the carboxylic acid is at position 3. So the ring has a double bond between 3 and 4, and a COOH group at position 3.

So, the COOH is attached to the ring. Its structure is O=C(OH)OH? No, wait, carboxylic acid is RCOOH, so the carbonyl is part of the substituent. So, that's another double bond.

So, the starting material has 5 DoU. Now, what does the reaction do?

The reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. What reaction conditions are these? I think that red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrohalogenation of alkenes. Wait, or perhaps in the addition of HI across the double bond.

Wait, but another thought: red phosphorus and iodine can be used in the Hofmann elimination, but that's for amines. Alternatively, red phosphorus is used in the Birch reduction, which reduces aromatic rings. But here, the starting material is a cyclohexene, not aromatic, so Birch might not apply.

Alternatively, maybe the red phosphorus is part of the HI addition. For example, when an alkene reacts with HI in presence of red phosphorus, it's a way to add HI across the double bond. But wait, in such a reaction, each double bond would add H and I, converting each double bond into a single bond with two H and I added.

Wait, but if the starting material has two double bonds (the cyclohexene and the vinyl group), then after reaction with excess HI, each double bond would add HI.

Wait, but let me think about each double bond.

First, the cyclohexene ring's double bond. Adding HI across it would convert the ring from a cyclohexene to a cyclohexane diiodide. For example, the double bond C3-C4 would become C3-I and C4-I with single bonds, and each would have an H added. Wait, no: the addition would be H on one carbon and I on the adjacent.

So, the cyclohexene (C3=C4) would become CH2-I and CH2-I in the ring? Or wait, perhaps it's more like, each C in the double bond would get one H and one I? So, after addition, each double bond becomes a single bond with two I and two H added? Wait, no, actually, each double bond would add two H and two I? No, wait, when you add HI across a double bond, each carbon in the double bond would get an H and an I. So, for each double bond, you add H and I to each end, so the result is a single bond with two I's and two H's added in total.

Wait, perhaps each double bond would convert into a single bond with two I atoms added. So, the cyclohexene (one double bond) would become a cyclohexane with two I substituents. Similarly, the vinyl group's double bond would add two I's, leading to a CH2-I-CH2 group.

But wait, the formyl group (CHO) has a double bond (C=O). Would that react under these conditions? Probably not, because the carbonyl is less reactive than alkenes. Red phosphorus and HI usually target the more substituted and more reactive double bonds first, like the cyclohexene and the vinyl.

So, after the reaction, the product would have:

- The cyclohexene ring converted into cyclohexane with two I atoms (each at C3 and C4, perhaps).
- The vinyl group (CH2-CH2) with two I atoms added, making it CH2-I-CH2-I?
Wait, no. Each double bond in the vinyl group would add HI across. So the vinyl group is CH2=CH-. Adding HI would make CH2-I-CH2-I? But that can't be right because adding HI across a double bond would give CH2-I and CH2-I, perhaps.

Wait, no. Let me think again. For a vinyl group, say CH2=CH2, adding HI would give CH2I-CH2I. But in reality, for a substituted vinyl group, like CH2=CH-R, adding HI would yield CH2I-CH2I-R? But wait, that's probably not accurate. Alternatively, each double bond would add HI once, leading to two I atoms added per double bond.

Wait, but let me think about the overall effect on the degree of unsaturation. Each double bond that is saturated (converted to single bond) reduces the DoU by one. So, in the starting material, we have 5 DoU. If two double bonds are converted (the cyclohexene and the vinyl), each contributes to one DoU. So each addition would reduce the DoU by 1. So, 5 - 2 = 3 DoU.

Wait, but also, the formyl group's double bond (C=O) is still present. So that's one DoU left. So the product would have DoU = (original 5) minus 2 (from the two double bonds that were saturated) = 3 DoU.

So the product's DoU would be 3.

Wait, but let me double-check. Do the reactions actually break both double bonds? Because the starting molecule has two double bonds in the main structure (cyclohexene and vinyl) and one in the formyl group. So the reaction adds HI to the cyclohexene and the vinyl group, each of which has a double bond. So each of those adds HI and becomes single bonds, thus each reducing the DoU by 1.

So, initial DoU: 5.

After reaction, DoU is 5 - 2 = 3.

So the answer would be B) 3.

But wait, let me check if there are other factors. For example, the carboxylic acid group: the COOH has a carbonyl, which is a double bond. It doesn't react in this condition, so that DoU remains. The formyl group's double bond is also unaffected, so that's another DoU. The vinyl and cyclohexene double bonds are converted to single bonds, each losing one DoU.

Wait, but wait, what about the rings? The cyclohexene ring is a six-membered ring, which is one DoU. When the double bond is added, the ring remains, so even after adding HI, the ring remains a cyclohexane, which has one ring (so one DoU). So that's a point I might have missed earlier.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me reevaluate. The initial DoU calculation for the starting material:

Cyclohexene ring: 1 ring (DoU +1) and 1 double bond (DoU +1) => 2.

Formyl group: 1 double bond => +1.

Vinyl group: 1 double bond => +1.

COOH group: 1 double bond => +1.

So total DoU is 2 + 1 +1 +1 = 5.

When the reaction occurs, the cyclohexene double bond is saturated. So the ring remains a ring, but the double bond is gone. So the DoU from the ring remains, but the DoU from the double bond is lost. So, the cyclohexene's two DoU (ring + double bond) becomes just the ring (DoU +1), so net loss of 1.

Similarly, the vinyl group's double bond is saturated. So that DoU is lost. So two DoU are lost in total.

The formyl and COOH groups' double bonds remain.

So, the product's DoU would be:

Original DoU: 5.

Minus 2 (from cyclohexene's double bond and vinyl's double bond) = 3.

So product DoU is 3.

But wait, another point: when you add HI across a double bond in a ring, does it open the ring? No, because the cyclohexene is a six-membered ring. Adding HI across the double bond would convert it into a cyclohexane, but the ring remains, so the ring's DoU is still there.

So the product's structure would have:

- A cyclohexane ring (so DoU +1 for the ring).
- The formyl group (DoU +1).
- The COOH group (DoU +1).
- The vinyl group's double bond is saturated, so no DoU from that.

So, product DoU is 1 (ring) + 2 (formyl and COOH) = 3.

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer is 3, which is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The index of hydrogen deficiency (DoU) of a molecule is calculated as:

\[
\text{DoU} = \frac{(2C + 2 - H - X + N)}{2}
\]

where \(C\) is the number of carbons, \(H\) is the number of hydrogens, \(X\) is the number of halogens, and \(N\) is the number of nitrogens. Each ring, double bond, or triple bond contributes to the DoU.

### Step 1: Analyze the starting material
The starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Its structure includes:
1. A **cyclohexene ring** (6-membered ring with one double bond between C3 and C4), contributing **2 DoU** (1 for the ring and 1 for the double bond).
2. A **formyl group (CHO)** at position 2, contributing **1 DoU** (from the carbonyl group).
3. A **vinyl group (CH\(_2\)=CH\(_\))** at position 5, contributing **1 DoU** (from the double bond).
4. A **carboxylic acid group (COOH)** at position 3, contributing **1 DoU** (from the carbonyl group).

Thus, the total **DoU of the starting material is 5**.

### Step 2: Reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI
Red phosphorus and HI are used to add HI across double bonds. In this reaction:
1. The **cyclohexene ring's double bond** is saturated, converting the cyclohexene into a cyclohexane. This eliminates 1 DoU.
2. The **vinyl group's double bond** is also saturated, eliminating another DoU.

The **formyl group** and **carboxylic acid group** remain unaffected, as carbonyl groups do not react under these conditions.

### Step 3: Calculate the DoU of the product
After the reaction:
1. The cyclohexane ring retains its **1 DoU** (from the ring).
2. The formyl group contributes **1 DoU** (from the carbonyl group).
3. The carboxylic acid group contributes **1 DoU** (from the carbonyl group).

The total **DoU of the product is 3**.

### Final Answer:
The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is **3**.
