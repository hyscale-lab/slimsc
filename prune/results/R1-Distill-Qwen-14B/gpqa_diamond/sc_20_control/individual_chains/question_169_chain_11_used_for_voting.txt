Okay, so I have this physics problem about nuclear decay, and I need to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let's read the question carefully.

The decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. Then, a variant changes it to emit one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. The question is how the energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles changes.

First, I remember that in nuclear decays, the energy of the emitted particles can depend on the conservation laws, like energy and momentum. Also, particles like beta particles have continuous spectra because of the way their energy is shared between them and other particles, like neutrinos.

In the original decay, two E particles are emitted along with two V particles. If the V particles are, say, electrons or positrons or something, their presence affects the energy distribution of the E particles. But wait, in the variant, instead of two Vs, we have one M, which is massless. So, maybe M behaves like a photon or a neutrino, which is massless and carries away energy and momentum.

In the original case, the total energy of the system is conserved. Let's think about the decay 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. Each E and V carries some energy. Since the E's are lighter, their energies are lower than the Vs if V is heavier. But how does this affect the spectrum?

Wait, no, in beta decay, for example, the emitted electron has a continuous spectrum because the neutrino takes away some energy. So, when you have multiple ejected particles, their energies are correlated. If you have two E particles, their energies are linked because the total energy of the decay must be shared between them and the other particles.

Now, the original decay emits two E and two V. Let's imagine E is an electron and V is a positron or something else. But the key point here is that the E particles' energy spectrum is continuous because the V particles (and B?) take away some energy. The maximum energy (endpoint Q) occurs when all the available energy goes into the E particles, but considering other particles are emitted.

Wait, no, the available Q is the maximum energy the E particles can have. Because when you have multiple particles emitted, their maximum energy is when they are emitted in the same direction, taking away as much energy as possible. But in the original decay, two E and two V are emitted. So the E's energy is limited because some energy goes into the V's.

In the variant decay, 2A → 2B + 2E + M. Now, M is a single massless particle. So it's like, instead of two Vs, we have one M. Let's think about the conservation of energy and momentum.

In the original decay, the four-momentum must be conserved. So the initial system is at rest (assuming 2A is at rest, or maybe it's more general). The decay products (2B, 2E, 2V) must carry away momentum such that the total is zero.

But since the initial system is heavy, the products have a lot of energy to distribute. The E particles' energies would vary based on the other particles' momenta.

Now, in the variant, instead of 2V, we have an M. M is massless, so it behaves like a photon or a neutrino. So when M is emitted, it's taking away a lot of energy and momentum from the system.

Wait, but M is a single particle, so all its momentum is in one direction. How does this affect the E particles' energies?

In the original scenario, when you have two V particles, each taking away some energy and momentum, but in the variant, you have one M instead of two Vs. So the E and M share the energy.

But the key thing is the energy spectrum of E. So in the original decay, the E particles' spectrum is continuous because the V particles take away varying amounts of energy, leading to a range of possible E energies. Similarly, in the variant, M is taking away some energy, so the E particles would still have a continuous spectrum because M's energy and momentum can vary.

Wait, but wait! In the original decay, we have two E and two V. So the energy is split among four particles, which would make the E's maximum energy lower than if only two particles (E and M) are emitted.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The initial decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. The available energy Q is the maximum energy each E can have. But with more particles, each E's energy would be lower because the energy is shared among more particles.

In the variant, we have 2A → 2B + 2E + M. Now, instead of four particles (2E, 2V), we have three: two E and one M. So in this case, the energy is shared among three particles. So each E could have more energy than before because there's less to split the energy.

Wait, but M is massless. So when M is emitted, it can carry away a significant amount of energy, but since it's massless, the maximum energy for M would be higher. Hmm, but in terms of the E particles' energy, perhaps the maximum (endpoint) would be higher because less energy is distributed to other particles.

Wait, let's model this. Let's imagine that in the original decay, the maximum energy for each E is Q. Now, when you change it to a single M, perhaps the maximum energy for E could be higher because M takes away a lot of energy, leaving more for E.

Wait, but in the original decay, each E can have up to Q, but in the variant, maybe each E can have more because the energy isn't split as much.

Wait, but the total available energy comes from the mass difference between the initial and final states. For the original decay, the Q value is fixed. But when you change the products, the Q could change. Wait, but the problem states that the original decay has a Q endpoint for E. The variant is a different reaction, but the question is about how the E's spectrum changes.

Wait, but the question says that in the variant, the same reaction is happening, but instead of two V's, we have one M. So the initial and final masses might be different. But the problem is about the energy spectrum of E.

In the original decay, each E particle's energy is continuous between 0 and Q. The maximum energy Q is when the E particles are emitted in such a way that all the available energy goes into their kinetic energy, but considering that other particles (V and B) must take some energy.

Wait, but if two E and two V are emitted, then the maximum each E can have is when they are moving in the same direction as the V's, but that's not possible because momentum has to be conserved. Alternatively, to maximize E's energy, perhaps the E's and V's are all moving in the same direction, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum energy for each E is when one E is moving in one direction and the other E and V are moving in the opposite direction, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of phase space. For the original decay, the E's have a continuous spectrum because their energies are determined by the distribution of energy among multiple particles. Similarly, in the variant, the E's could have a continuous spectrum because M is another particle taking away energy and momentum.

But the question is whether the spectrum changes from continuous to discrete. Wait, when would a spectrum become discrete? That usually happens when a particle's energy is quantized, such as when it's the only particle emitted, or when it's emitted with certain spin or angular momentum constraints. But in beta decay, the electron has a continuous spectrum because the neutrino carries away some energy. Similarly, in the original decay, the E's have a continuous spectrum because the V's and B's carry away some energy.

In the variant, E's are emitted along with M. Since M is a single massless particle, perhaps the energy sharing is such that the E's can have a different range. But would their spectrum remain continuous?

I think the energy of the E particles would still be continuous because M can have a range of energies, leading to E's having a range as well. So the spectrum remains continuous.

Now, what about the endpoint Q? The maximum energy E can have. In the original case, with two E and two V, the maximum energy each E can have is when the V's have minimal energy (like zero, if possible). But since V are also particles, they have to take some energy.

In the variant, with M being emitted, perhaps it's possible for E to have a higher maximum energy because M can take away a larger portion of the energy, leaving more for E. So the endpoint would increase.

Wait, but wait. The total energy available in the decay is fixed. So if in the original decay, the maximum energy for E is Q, and in the variant, you have fewer particles to share the energy, perhaps each E can have a higher maximum energy.

Alternatively, the maximum energy of E would be when M takes as much energy as possible, but since M is massless, it can carry away a lot. Wait, but if M is emitted opposite to E, that allows E to have more energy. But I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Another approach: In the original decay, multiple particles (two E and two V) share the available energy, so the maximum E energy is lower. In the variant, only two E and one M share the energy, so each E can have a higher maximum. So the endpoint Q increases.

So the original E's have a continuous spectrum with a certain Q. The variant has a continuous spectrum as well, but with a higher Q.

So looking at the options, the correct scenario is that the spectrum remains continuous, and the endpoint increases. Which is option B.

The problem involves analyzing the energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles in two variants of a nuclear decay: the original decay, \( 2A \to 2B + 2E + 2V \), and a modified decay where the two V particles are replaced by a single massless particle M, \( 2A \to 2B + 2E + M \). The goal is to determine how the energy spectrum of the E particles changes.

In the original decay, the energy of the E particles is continuous because the total energy is shared among multiple particles (2E, 2V, and 2B). The continuous spectrum arises due to the varying energy distribution among these particles, with the maximum energy (endpoint) \( Q \) determined by the total available energy in the decay.

In the modified decay, the two V particles are replaced by a single massless particle M. Since M is massless, it can carry away a significant amount of energy and momentum, leaving more energy available for the E particles. This change reduces the number of particles sharing the energy, allowing the E particles to have a higher maximum energy (endpoint). The energy spectrum of the E particles remains continuous because M can still take away energy in varying amounts, leading to a range of possible energies for the E particles.

Thus, the energy spectrum of the E particles remains continuous in both cases, but the endpoint \( Q \) increases in the modified decay due to the reduced energy sharing among fewer particles.

**Option Analysis:**
- **A)** Incorrect. The spectrum does not become discrete; it remains continuous in both cases.
- **B)** Correct. The spectrum remains continuous, and the endpoint increases because fewer particles share the energy in the modified decay.
- **C)** Incorrect. The spectrum does not become discrete, and the endpoint does not decrease.
- **D)** Incorrect. While the spectrum remains continuous, the endpoint increases, not decreases.

Answer: B
