Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. New particles are produced, and they travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reach the detector's inner walls. The detector's radius is 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls instead.

Hmm, so the key here seems to be about the relationship between the particles' speed (or their lifetime) and the distance they can travel before decaying. Since the detector is spherical and they start at the center, the particles will move outward in all directions. But only those that reach the inner walls are detected.

Wait, but the problem says that one third reach the inner walls when the Lorentz factor is 20. So I think the detection depends on the particles' lifetime being long enough for them to travel the radius of the detector before decaying.

In particle physics, when particles are moving at relativistic speeds, their lifetimes as observed in the lab frame are longer due to time dilation. The proper lifetime (the lifetime in the particle's rest frame) multiplied by the Lorentz factor gamma gives the lifetime in the lab frame. So, the particles can travel a longer distance before decaying because their lifetime is longer.

So the formula for the distance a particle travels before decaying is: distance = velocity * lifetime. But since we're dealing with relativistic speeds, I think the velocity can be approximated as the speed of light, c, because they're moving at ultra-relativistic velocities. So, distance ≈ c * (gamma * proper_lifetime).

The particles that reach the detector's walls are those whose proper lifetime is such that their gamma multiplied by their proper time allows them to travel at least the radius of the detector.

Wait, but in the initial case, when gamma is 20, only one third (1/3) of the particles reach the walls. So perhaps the average lifetime is such that a fraction of them have sufficient gamma to reach the detector. So I need to find when two-thirds reach, which would require a higher gamma, since a higher gamma would mean a longer lifetime, allowing more particles to reach the walls.

But wait, let me think again. The number of particles that reach the detector depends on the product of the velocity, the lifetime, and the number of particles. Alternatively, perhaps it's more about the particles' decay length. The decay length is the average distance a particle travels before decaying. So if the decay length is longer than the detector's radius, a higher fraction of particles would reach the walls.

The decay length L is given by L = gamma * c * tau, where tau is the proper lifetime. So for a particle to reach the inner wall, its decay length must be at least equal to the radius R of the detector.

Wait, but in the first case, when gamma is 20, only one third reach the walls. So maybe the decay length when gamma is 20 is equal to the radius for some fraction. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think more carefully.

Suppose that each particle has a certain probability of decaying before traveling a certain distance. The probability that a particle decays after traveling a distance x is given by the exponential decay formula: P(decayed) = 1 - exp(-x/(gamma c tau)).

Wait, but wait. The average lifetime is tau_lab = gamma tau_rest. The mean lifetime in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime. The mean distance a particle travels before decaying is called the decay length, which is L = c * tau_lab = c * gamma tau. But wait, if the proper lifetime is tau, then the decay length is gamma * c * tau.

So if the decay length is less than R, then the particle would, on average, decay before reaching the wall. The fraction of particles that reach the wall would be the probability that they decay after traveling a distance equal to R, which is P = exp(-R/(gamma c tau)).

Wait, yes, because the decay probability is Poisson. So the probability that a particle hasn't decayed by the time it has traveled a distance R is P = exp(-R/(L)), where L is the mean decay length, which is gamma c tau.

So, in the initial situation, when gamma is 20, the fraction that reach the inner walls is 1/3. So, 1/3 = exp(-R/(gamma c tau)).

Wait, that's the formula. So when the gamma is 20, the fraction is 1/3.

Wait, but the problem says "on average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reaches the detector inner walls." So that suggests that the probability is 1/3.

So, 1/3 = exp(- R/(gamma c tau) )

Wait, but in the problem, the radius is R =30 meters. So substituting:

1/3 = exp( -30/(20 c tau) )

Taking natural logs on both sides:

ln(1/3) = -30/(20 c tau )

=> ln(1/3) = - 3/(2 c tau )

Because 30/20 is 3/2.

But ln(1/3) is -ln(3) ≈ -1.0986.

So:

-1.0986 ≈ -3/(2 c tau )

Multiply both sides by -1:

1.0986 ≈ 3/(2 c tau )

So,

c tau ≈ 3/(2 * 1.0986) 

Calculating that:

3 divided by (2*1.0986) = 3/(~2.1972) ≈ 1.367.

So c tau ≈ 1.367 meters. Because the units would be meters? Since R is in meters.

Wait, c is in meters per second, tau is in seconds, so c tau is meters.

So, c tau ≈ 1.367 meters.

Hmm, okay, that's a key value. So, in the first case, with gamma=20, c tau is about 1.367 meters.

Now, the question is, what gamma do we need so that two-thirds of the particles reach the walls? So 2/3 ≈ 0.6667.

So, 2/3 = exp(- R/(gamma' c tau) )

Take natural logs again:

ln(2/3) = -30/(gamma' c tau )

So, ln(2/3) is approximately ln(0.6667) ≈ -0.4055.

So,

-0.4055 = -30/(gamma' c tau )

Multiply both sides by -1:

0.4055 = 30/(gamma' c tau )

We've already determined that c tau ≈ 1.367 meters. So substituting that in:

0.4055 = 30/(gamma' * 1.367 )

Wait, 30 is the radius in meters, right. So,

gamma' = 30 / (1.367 * 0.4055 )

Let me compute that denominator.

1.367 * 0.4055 ≈ Let me calculate:

1.367 * 0.4 = 0.5468

1.367 * 0.0055 ≈ approx 0.0075185

Adding together: ~0.5468 + 0.0075 ≈ 0.5543.

So, gamma' ≈ 30 / 0.5543 ≈ let's compute that.

30 divided by 0.5543.

Let me compute 0.5543 * 54 = approx 0.5543 *50=27.715, 0.5543*4=2.2172 → total 29.932, which is about 30. So 54.

Wait, that's about 54. So Gamma' is approximately 54.

Looking at the options, option A is 54.

So the answer would be A) 54.

To determine the Lorentz factor needed for about two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector's inner walls, we analyze the relationship between the particles' decay length and the detector's radius. The decay length \( L \) is given by:

\[
L = \gamma c \tau
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( c \) is the speed of light, and \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle. The fraction of particles that reach the detector's inner walls depends on the probability that they decay after traveling a distance \( R \), which is:

\[
P = \exp\left(-\frac{R}{\gamma c \tau}\right)
\]

### Step 1: Analyze the initial case (\( \gamma = 20 \))
In the initial scenario, one-third (\( \frac{1}{3} \)) of the particles reach the detector's inner walls. Substituting \( P = \frac{1}{3} \) and \( R = 30 \, \text{m} \) into the probability formula:

\[
\frac{1}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{30}{20 c \tau}\right)
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{30}{20 c \tau}
\]

\[
-\ln(3) = -\frac{3}{2 c \tau}
\]

\[
c \tau = \frac{3}{2 \ln(3)} \approx 1.367 \, \text{m}
\]

Thus, the product \( c \tau \) is approximately \( 1.367 \, \text{m} \).

### Step 2: Determine the Lorentz factor for \( P = \frac{2}{3} \)
We now seek the Lorentz factor \( \gamma' \) such that two-thirds (\( \frac{2}{3} \)) of the particles reach the detector's inner walls. Substituting \( P = \frac{2}{3} \) into the probability formula:

\[
\frac{2}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{30}{\gamma' c \tau}\right)
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{30}{\gamma' c \tau}
\]

\[
-\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{30}{\gamma' c \tau}
\]

\[
\gamma' c \tau = \frac{30}{\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)}
\]

Substituting \( c \tau \approx 1.367 \, \text{m} \) and \( \ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) \approx -0.4055 \):

\[
\gamma' = \frac{30}{1.367 \cdot 0.4055}
\]

\[
\gamma' \approx \frac{30}{0.5543} \approx 54
\]

### Conclusion
The Lorentz factor needed for about two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector's inner walls is approximately \( \gamma' = 54 \).
