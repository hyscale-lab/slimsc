Okay, so I need to find the energy spectrum for a quantum mechanical particle moving in a two-dimensional potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

First, I remember that in two dimensions, especially for central potentials that depend on r, the problem can often be separated into radial and angular parts. But wait, this potential isn't purely radial because there's a θ dependence here. Oh right, because of the cos²θ term. So this isn't a central potential anymore; it's got an angular component. 

Wait, but maybe I can still separate variables somehow. Let me try to express this potential in terms of Cartesian coordinates. Using polar coordinates, x = r cosθ and y = r sinθ. So substituting, cosθ = x/r. Therefore, cos²θ = x²/(r²). So the potential V can be rewritten as (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² (x²/r²) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k x². Oh, that's interesting because r² is x² + y². So substituting that in, V(r,θ) becomes (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x². 

Let me compute that: (1/2)k x² + (1/2)k y² + (3/2)k x². Adding like terms, (1/2 + 3/2)k x² + (1/2)k y². That simplifies to 2k x² + (1/2)k y². Wait, no: (1/2 + 3/2) is 2, right? So 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Wait, so the potential is V(x,y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y². Oh, so this is a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator, but with different frequencies in each direction. Because the potential is quadratic in x and y, but with different coefficients. 

I remember that the energy levels for a two-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator (where the frequencies are the same in x and y) are E = (n_x + n_y + 1)ℏω, where ω is sqrt(k/m) for each direction. But in this case, the frequencies might be different.

Wait, but here, the potential in x is 2k x², so the effective spring constant for x is 2k. Similarly, in y, it's (1/2)k. So the frequency in the x direction is ω_x = sqrt(2k/m), and in the y direction, ω_y = sqrt( (1/2)k/m ). 

Wait, no, wait. The standard harmonic oscillator potential is (1/2)m ω² x². Comparing that to our V_x term: V_x = 2k x². So 2k x² = (1/2) m ω_x² x² → ω_x² = (4k)/(m). So ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m). Similarly, for y, V_y = (1/2)k y² = (1/2) m ω_y² y² → ω_y² = (k)/m → ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

So each direction has a different frequency. Now, the energy of a 2D harmonic oscillator is the sum of the energies in each direction. For each direction, the energy is (n + 1/2) ℏ ω. So the total energy E is (n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x + (n_y + 1/2) ℏ ω_y.

Substituting the frequencies, that becomes (n_x + 1/2) ℏ * 2 sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2) ℏ * sqrt(k/m). Let me factor out sqrt(k/m) and ℏ:

E = [ (n_x + 1/2) * 2 + (n_y + 1/2) * 1 ] * ℏ sqrt(k/m)
= [ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ] * ℏ sqrt(k/m)
= (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m)

Wait, let me double-check that: 2*(n_x + 1/2) is 2n_x +1, and 1*(n_y + 1/2) is n_y + 1/2. Adding them: 2n_x +1 +n_y +1/2 = 2n_x +n_y + 3/2.

Looking at the options, option C is E = (2n_x +n_y +3/2)ℏ sqrt(k/m). So option C. 

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any other possible approach. For example, perhaps the problem could be transformed into a different coordinate system or involve angular momentum somehow. But since the potential is separable into x and y terms after substitution, I think the approach I took is correct.

Alternatively, if I think about the potential in terms of polar coordinates, maybe I can find a way to separate the equation. Let me think: the potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Hmm, that can be written as (k r²/2)(1 + 3 cos²θ). But 3 cos²θ = 3 (1 + cos 2θ)/2 → So V(r,θ) = (k r²/2)(1 + (3/2)(1 + cos 2θ)) )? Wait, maybe that's not the right approach.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of angular variables. Does this potential allow for separation of variables in terms of r and θ? Let me see. The potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let's write this as V(r,θ) = (k r²/2) (1 + 3 cos²θ). So V(r,θ) = (k r²/2) [1 + 3 cos²θ]. 

Hmm, in polar coordinates, the Schrödinger equation is a bit more complicated, but if the potential doesn't depend on r and θ in a way that allows separation, it's tricky. But wait, in our earlier approach, by converting to Cartesian coordinates, the potential became separable into x and y, making it easier to handle. So perhaps the initial approach is correct.

So the energy levels are given by option C: E = (2n_x +n_y +3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

To determine the energy spectrum of a quantum mechanical particle moving in the potential \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cos^2(\theta) \), we start by analyzing the potential. Rewriting \( \cos^2(\theta) \) in terms of Cartesian coordinates using \( \cos(\theta) = \frac{x}{r} \), the potential becomes:

\[
V(x, y) = \frac{1}{2}k(x^2 + y^2) + \frac{3}{2}k \frac{x^2}{r^2} r^2 = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2.
\]

This potential describes a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator with different spring constants in the \(x\)- and \(y\)-directions. The effective frequencies are determined by the spring constants:

- For the \(x\)-direction: \(\omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\),
- For the \(y\)-direction: \(\omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\).

The energy levels of a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator are the sum of the energy levels in each direction. For the \(x\)-direction, the energy is \((n_x + \frac{1}{2})\hbar\omega_x\), and for the \(y\)-direction, the energy is \((n_y + \frac{1}{2})\hbar\omega_y\). Adding these contributions gives the total energy:

\[
E = \left( n_x + \frac{1}{2} \right)\hbar\omega_x + \left( n_y + \frac{1}{2} \right)\hbar\omega_y.
\]

Substituting the frequencies:

\[
E = \left( n_x + \frac{1}{2} \right)\hbar \cdot 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} + \left( n_y + \frac{1}{2} \right)\hbar \cdot \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

Factoring out \(\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\), we get:

\[
E = \left( 2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2} \right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

This matches the energy spectrum given in option C. The other options do not correctly account for the different frequencies in the \(x\)- and \(y\)-directions.

Okay, so I need to find the energy spectrum for a quantum mechanical particle moving in a two-dimensional potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

Wait, but maybe I can still separate variables somehow. Let me try to express this potential in terms of Cartesian coordinates. Using polar coordinates, x = r cosθ and y = r sinθ. So substituting, cosθ = x/r. Therefore, cos²θ = x²/(r²). So the potential V can be rewritten as (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² (x²/r²) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k x². Oh, that's interesting because r² is x² + y². So substituting that in, V(r,θ) becomes (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x². 

Let me compute that: (1/2)k x² + (1/2)k y² + (3/2)k x². Adding like terms, (1/2 + 3/2)k x² + (1/2)k y². That simplifies to 2k x² + (1/2)k y². Wait, no: (1/2 + 3/2) is 2, right? So 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Wait, so the potential is V(x,y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y². Oh, so this is a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator, but with different frequencies in each direction. Because the potential is quadratic in x and y, but with different coefficients. 

I remember that the energy levels for a two-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator (where the frequencies are the same in x and y) are E = (n_x + n_y + 1)ℏω, where ω is sqrt(k/m) for each direction. But in this case, the frequencies might be different.

Wait, but here, the potential in x is 2k x², so the effective spring constant for x is 2k. Similarly, in y, it's (1/2)k. So the frequency in the x direction is ω_x = sqrt(2k/m), and in the y direction, ω_y = sqrt( (1/2)k/m ). 

Wait, no, wait. The standard harmonic oscillator potential is (1/2)m ω² x². Comparing that to our V_x term: V_x = 2k x². So 2k x² = (1/2) m ω_x² x² → ω_x² = (4k)/(m). So ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m). Similarly, for y, V_y = (1/2)k y² = (1/2) m ω_y² y² → ω_y² = (k)/m → ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

So each direction has a different frequency. Now, the energy of a 2D harmonic oscillator is the sum of the energies in each direction. For each direction, the energy is (n + 1/2) ℏ ω. So the total energy E is (n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x + (n_y + 1/2) ℏ ω_y.

Substituting the frequencies, that becomes (n_x + 1/2) ℏ * 2 sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2) ℏ * sqrt(k/m). Let me factor out sqrt(k/m) and ℏ:

E = [ (n_x + 1/2) * 2 + (n_y + 1/2) * 1 ] * ℏ sqrt(k/m)
= [ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ] * ℏ sqrt(k/m)
= (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m)

Wait, let me double-check that: 2*(n_x + 1/2) is 2n_x +1, and 1*(n_y + 1/2) is n_y + 1/2. Adding them: 2n_x +1 +n_y +1/2 = 2n_x +n_y + 3/2.

Looking at the options, option C is E = (2n_x +n_y +3/2)ℏ sqrt(k/m). So option C. 

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any other possible approach. For example, perhaps the problem could be transformed into a different coordinate system or involve angular momentum somehow. But since the potential is separable into x and y terms after substitution, I think the approach I took is correct.

Hmm, that can be written as (k r²/2)(1 + 3 cos²θ). But 3 cos²θ = 3 (1 + cos 2θ)/2 → So V(r,θ) = (k r²/2)(1 + (3/2)(1 + cos 2θ)) )? Wait, maybe that's not the right approach.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of angular variables. Does this potential allow for separation of variables in terms of r and θ? Let me see. The potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let's write this as V(r,θ) = (k r²/2) (1 + 3 cos²θ). So V(r,θ) = (k r²/2) [1 + 3 cos²θ].

To determine the energy spectrum of a quantum mechanical particle moving in the potential \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cos^2(\theta) \), we start by analyzing the potential. Rewriting \( \cos^2(\theta) \) in terms of Cartesian coordinates using \( \cos(\theta) = \frac{x}{r} \), the potential becomes:

\[
V(x, y) = \frac{1}{2}k(x^2 + y^2) + \frac{3}{2}k \frac{x^2}{r^2} r^2 = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2.
\]

This potential describes a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator with different spring constants in the \(x\)- and \(y\)-directions. The effective frequencies are determined by the spring constants:

- For the \(x\)-direction: \(\omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\),
- For the \(y\)-direction: \(\omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\).

The energy levels of a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator are the sum of the energy levels in each direction. For the \(x\)-direction, the energy is \((n_x + \frac{1}{2})\hbar\omega_x\), and for the \(y\)-direction, the energy is \((n_y + \frac{1}{2})\hbar\omega_y\). Adding these contributions gives the total energy:

\[
E = \left( n_x + \frac{1}{2} \right)\hbar\omega_x + \left( n_y + \frac{1}{2} \right)\hbar\omega_y.
\]

Substituting the frequencies:

\[
E = \left( n_x + \frac{1}{2} \right)\hbar \cdot 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} + \left( n_y + \frac{1}{2} \right)\hbar \cdot \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

Factoring out \(\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\), we get:

\[
E = \left( 2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2} \right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

This matches the energy spectrum given in option C. The other options do not correctly account for the different frequencies in the \(x\)- and \(y\)-directions.
