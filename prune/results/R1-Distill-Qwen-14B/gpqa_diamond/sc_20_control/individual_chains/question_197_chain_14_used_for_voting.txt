Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let's try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying a compound X that undergoes a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. The options are four different compounds, and I need to determine which one is the product.

First, let's look at the given data: IR and 1H NMR spectra of compound X. So, I'll need to analyze these to figure out what X is, and then determine what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

Starting with the IR data: The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610 cm-1, and 1450 cm-1. The broad peak between 3400 and 2500 likely indicates an -OH stretch or possibly an -NH group. But since there's no mention of amines in the options, maybe it's a carboxylic acid (since they have broad -OH stretches). Wait, but the 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which usually corresponds to a carbonyl group. That could be from a ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. But carboxylic acids typically have a peak around 1700 cm-1 and a broad O-H around 2500-3000 cm-1. Wait, but the IR here shows a broad peak that's more like 3400–2500, which might actually be an overtone or something else. Hmm, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an aromatic ring with a carbonyl group. Also, the 1610 and 1450 cm-1 peaks might suggest aromatic ring stretching (like C=C in benzene). So perhaps X is a substituted benzene with a carbonyl group attached.

Looking at the NMR data: The 1H NMR shows several signals.

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, possibly an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid -OH. Because alcohols and carboxylic acids typically show up around there, and the broadness suggests exchange, which is common for -OH protons.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): This is likely aromatic protons. A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. So maybe it's part of a para-substituted benzene ring.
- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another aromatic doublet. Since the chemical shifts are around 8.0 and 7.2, that's typical for a para-substituted benzene where there's an electron-withdrawing group in the para position. For example, if the substituent is a carbonyl group, like a ketone or a carboxylic acid. Because if it's an electron-withdrawing group, the ring protons would be deshielded and appear downfield. Wait, but if the substituent is in para, then the protons next to it would be more deshielded. Wait, let's think: if the substituent is para, then the two protons adjacent (meta) to it would be deshielded. Wait, no, in a para-substituted benzene, the adjacent protons would be ortho. So for example, if the substituent is at position 4, then the protons at positions 2 and 6 (ortho) would be more deshielded and appear downfield. The protons at positions 3 and 5 (meta) would be less deshielded and appear upfield. So in that case, the two ortho protons would be around 8.0 ppm, and the meta protons around 7.2 ppm. That fits with the NMR data here. So that suggests the substituents are para, and the substituent is electron-withdrawing.

Now the substituent itself: The IR suggested a carbonyl. So if the substituent is a carbonyl, like a ketone or a carboxylic acid. Let's look at the other NMR signals.

At 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): This is a multiplet, maybe a CH next to a carbonyl. Like a CH adjacent to a carbonyl group, perhaps in a ketone or ester.

Then 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Multiplet, maybe CH2 groups. Perhaps part of an ethyl chain?

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet of 3H. That sounds like a methyl group attached to a CH. Because a doublet means it's coupled with one neighboring group. So a CH connected to a CH3.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet of 3H. That suggests a methyl group at the end of an ethyl chain. Like CH2CH3.

Putting this together: the substituent on the benzene ring is probably a carbonyl group (from IR) attached to a chain. Let's think about the possible structure.

Wait, let's think about the substituent. If the substituent is a carbonyl attached to a branched chain... For example, if we have something like a benzoyl group (Ph-C=O), but then the other groups don't fit. Or maybe the substituent is a ketone group that's connected to a chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CO-R group, where R is some alkyl group. So, the NMR shows that the substituent has a CH next to the carbonyl. So the structure might be:

Ph-CO-R

Where R is CH-CH2-CH(CH3)2? Or something similar.

Wait, let's break down the NMR signals.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is likely the CH next to the carbonyl. So the carbonyl is connected to a CH, which is connected to another CH2 group and perhaps a branching.

Looking at the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), that's probably the CH2 groups adjacent to the CH.

The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) would be a methyl group attached to the CH, like CH(CH3). And the 0.9 ppm (t,3H) would be an ethyl group, like CH2CH3.

So putting it all together, the R group is probably (CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, let me think. Alternatively, maybe it's a chain like CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH(CH3)2? Hmm, perhaps a branching.

Wait, another approach: the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is likely a CH2CH3 group. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) is probably two adjacent CH2 groups. So maybe the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-something.

Wait, maybe it's a longer chain. Let me think of it as a butyl group. The 0.9 ppm t suggests a terminal methyl group, so maybe it's part of an ethyl chain.

Putting all together, perhaps the substituent on the benzene is a carbonyl attached to a CH group, which is connected to a CH2CH2CH(CH3)2 or something. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a benzoyl group with a substituent.

Wait, perhaps the structure is 4-(something)benzoic acid. Let's think.

Benzoic acid has a structure where the benzene ring is connected to a COOH group. But in this case, the substituent could be a COOH group with a longer chain attached. Or perhaps it's a ketone, not a carboxylic acid.

Wait, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1. For a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl peak is usually around 1700 cm-1, maybe a bit higher. For a ketone, it's around 1700-1750. But if the substituent is a ketone, then the IR would have a peak around that. So, perhaps the substituent is a ketone group.

But wait, the NMR also has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad singlet. That's more consistent with a carboxylic acid's -OH proton. So maybe the substituent is a carboxylic acid group.

Wait, but that would mean the IR peak at 1720 could be a carboxylic acid. But carboxylic acids usually have a slightly lower wavenumber for the carbonyl, like around 1680-1700. 1720 is a bit higher, which might indicate a ketone or maybe an ester.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl with an adjacent oxygen, like a carbonyl in an ester or a ketone.

Wait, but then the NMR has a broad singlet at 10.5, which is a puzzle. If it's a carbonyl group but not a carboxylic acid, perhaps it's an aldehyde proton. But aldehydes typically have a peak around 9-10 ppm as a singlet or doublet. But an aldehyde proton is usually a triplet if coupled with adjacent protons, but sometimes it's a singlet if there's no coupling. Wait, but in a benzaldehyde, the aldehyde proton is around 9.8-10 ppm, and it's a singlet. So maybe that's what we have here.

Wait, but in that case, the substituent would be a benzaldehyde group. But then, the IR would have a peak around 2820 and 2720 cm-1 (the aldehyde C-H stretch), but looking at the IR data, the 3400–2500 cm-1 is a broad peak, which might be an O-H or an aldehyde. Hmm. But the IR data doesn't show the sharp peaks for aldehyde C-H, unless it's a very strong peak that's not specified here.

Alternatively, perhaps the 3400–2500 cm-1 is the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. Then, the 1720 cm-1 would be the carbonyl of the acid. Wait, but the 1720 is a bit high for a carboxylic acid, which is usually around 1700. Hmm, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl. Like, if the carbonyl is part of an aromatic ring, like a ketone attached to the ring. For example, acetophenone has a carbonyl around 1680-1700 cm-1. Wait, but in the IR given, it's at 1720. So maybe it's a ketone but in a different environment.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester. Esters have carbonyls around 1720-1740 cm-1, so that could fit.

Wait, but if it's an ester, the 10.5 ppm peak would be something else. Unless it's an acidic proton elsewhere. Maybe it's a phenolic -OH, but that's less likely because the IR would show a broad peak around 3200-3600. The given IR has a broad peak between 3400 and 2500, which is a bit confusing. Maybe it's a carbonyl group and another functional group.

Alternatively, perhaps the 3400–2500 is not an O-H. Could it be an -NH stretch? But again, the options don't seem to involve amines.

Wait, another thought: maybe the 3400–2500 is an aromatic C-H stretch. No, that's usually around 3000-3100, and it's not that broad. So I'm back to thinking that the broad peak is an O-H, suggesting either a carboxylic acid or an alcohol.

If it's a carboxylic acid, then the substituent is a COOH group attached to the benzene ring. The NMR would have a -COOH group, which typically shows a singlet around 10-12 ppm for the O-H. That fits the 10.5 ppm peak.

So, putting this together: the structure is a benzoic acid derivative. The benzene ring is para-substituted, with a COOH group in one position and another group in the para position.

Wait, but the NMR shows two doublets in the aromatic region. So, if the substituent is in the para position, then the ring would have two sets of doublets. For example, two protons ortho to the substituent would be around 8 ppm, and the other two (meta) around 7.2 ppm. So that fits. So the substituent is in the para position.

Now, the substituent is a COOH group, but wait, the IR peak at 1720 cm-1 suggests a higher wavenumber than a typical carboxylic acid. Hmm. Maybe the substituent is an ester group, which would have a higher carbonyl wavenumber.

Wait, but the NMR has a singlet at 10.5 ppm. Esters don't have O-H protons, so that would not fit. So maybe it's a carbonyl with another group, like a ketone, but the O-H is from something else.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a ketone, and there's another functional group, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl connected to a branched chain with a methyl group. Let me think about the NMR again.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is probably a CH adjacent to the carbonyl. Then, the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be two CH2 groups. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a methyl attached to a CH, and the 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is a terminal methyl from an ethyl group.

So, perhaps the structure is:

Ph-C(=O)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2CH(CH3) ?

Wait, maybe it's a longer chain. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propionyl group (CH2CH2CO-) but that doesn't seem to fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituent like CH2CH(CH2CH3)COOH.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to construct the structure.

Suppose the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. The NMR suggests a methyl group (d,3H) attached to a CH, which is next to a CH2 group. Then, the CH2 is next to another CH2, which is connected to the benzene. Wait, no, because the substituent is on the benzene.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)2 group attached to a CH(CH3), and all that connected to the carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propionyl group with a branching, like:

Ph-C(=O)-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-something? No, I'm not getting it right.

Wait, perhaps it's a butyl group attached to the carbonyl. The 0.9 triplet suggests a terminal CH2CH3. Then, the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be the two CH2 groups in the middle. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a methyl attached to a CH, which is next to the carbonyl. So the substituent would be Ph-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, that would make the substituent a pentyl group, but the NMR doesn't show all of that.

Alternatively, perhaps it's Ph-C(=O)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3. Let me count the signals.

Wait, another approach. Let's consider the possible options given.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C)4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D)1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Wait, so option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Which would mean the benzene has a COOH group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

Let's think about the structure of option C. Benzoic acid has a COOH group attached to the benzene ring. The substituent would be at the para position, which is position 4. So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group at position 4.

A sec-butyl group is (CH2)2CH(CH3)-, but wait, no, the structure of a sec-butyl group is CH(CH2CH2) something. Wait, no, sec-butyl is (CH2)CHCH2- connected to the ring. Wait, no: the structure of a sec-butyl group is (CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-, no, perhaps better to draw it.

Wait, the structure of a sec-butyl group is:

-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- ?

No, wait. Let me get this straight. The butyl group can be primary, secondary, or tertiary. A sec-butyl group is a four-carbon chain with the point of attachment on the second carbon. So, for example, it would be:

CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-

Wait, no. Let me think: the butyl group is CH2CH2CH2CH3, but the sec-butyl would be where the substituent is on the second carbon: so it's CH(CH2CH2CH3) connected to the benzene. Wait, no, perhaps it's -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think: the structure for a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. No, perhaps it's CH(CH2CH2CH3)- attached, but that would be a longer chain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is CH2CH2CH(CH3)-. Hmm, perhaps I should visualize it.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a (CH2)2CH- group, but that would be isobutyl. Wait, wait: the isobutyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3). No, maybe not. Let me think: the primary butyl is CH2CH2CH2CH3-, the sec-butyl is CH(CH2CH2)CH2-.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure for sec-butyl is:

The benzene ring is attached to CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-?

No, perhaps the correct structure of a sec-butyl group is:

-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try another approach.

Looking at option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the benzene ring has a COOH group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

So the substituents are in the para positions.

The benzene ring would have two substituents: COOH (para to the sec-butyl).

So the NMR would show the aromatic protons as two doublets: the ones ortho to the COOH would be more deshielded (higher ppm, around 8.0), and the ones ortho to the sec-butyl would be less deshielded, but wait, the substituents are both in the para position. Wait, no, the substituents are at positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (sec-butyl).

In that case, the aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6. So the H at position 2 is ortho to COOH and meta to the sec-butyl. Similarly, the H at position 6 is ortho to COOH and meta to the sec-butyl. The H at position 3 is meta to COOH and ortho to the sec-butyl. The same goes for position 5.

Wait, but for a para-substituted benzene, the substituents are opposite each other, so the effect on the ring's protons would be such that the protons adjacent to the substituent (ortho) are deshielded and appear downfield. The meta protons would be more shielded than the ortho but less than the para, but the para position is where the substituent is.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of substituent effects. The COOH group is electron-withdrawing, so the ortho protons (2 and 6) would be deshielded and appear downfield. The sec-butyl group is an electron-donating group (since it's an alkyl group), so the ortho protons (positions 3 and 5) would be shielded and appear upfield.

So in the NMR, the two ortho protons to COOH would be around 8.0 ppm (doublets), and the two ortho protons to the sec-butyl would be around 7.2 ppm (doublets). That matches the given NMR data: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H).

Now, looking at the other NMR signals. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is probably the CH group in the sec-butyl substituent. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be the two CH2 groups in the sec-butyl chain. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) would be the methyl group attached to the CH in the sec-butyl group. And the 0.9 ppm (t,3H) could be the terminal methyl group of the ethyl chain.

Wait, the structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. No, that's not correct. Let me think again: the structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, perhaps the actual structure is -(CH2)CH(CH3)-. No, that's only three carbons. Wait, but butyl is four carbons. Let me think: butyl is CH2CH2CH2CH3. The sec-butyl group is where the substituent is on the second carbon. So the structure would be CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but that's only three carbons attached. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me count: the substituent is attached to the second carbon of a four-carbon chain. So the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-? No, that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-, but that's five carbons. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which would be -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-. But I'm getting confused. Maybe another approach: the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which would have a branching. So in the NMR, the CH adjacent to the carbonyl (which is the CH in the sec-butyl group) would show up as a multiplet around 2.9 ppm. The CH2 groups would show up as the 1.7 ppm multiplet, and the methyl groups would be at 1.4 ppm (d) and 0.9 ppm (t).

Putting it all together, the structure would be a benzoic acid (COOH) at position 1, and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

Now, the reaction: compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, which is used to reduce carbonyl groups (like ketones or aldehydes) to methylene groups. Wait, no, the Wolff-Kishner is for removing carbonyl groups, converting them into methylene groups. For example, it converts ketones into alkanes.

Wait, but wait, another possibility: red phosphorus with HI is also used in the HWE (Hell–Volhard–Zelinskii) reaction, but that's for bromination of carboxylic acids. No, that's not right. Alternatively, red phosphorus and iodine are used in the iodination of alcohols. Wait, but in this case, HI might be present.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution. Let me think about the substituent on the benzene after reaction.

If compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then reacting with red phosphorus and HI might lead to some reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's a protection/deprotection step. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of the carbonyl group.

Wait, wait, but benzoic acid has a carbonyl group (COOH). If the reaction is a reduction, perhaps it would convert the COOH into a CH2OH group, but that's not a typical Wolff-Kishner reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH is replaced.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the carbonyl group is replaced by iodide, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution, but in this case, I don't see a leaving group.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH is converted into an iodide. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction involves the substitution of a hydrogen in the substituent. For example, the sec-butyl group might undergo some substitution.

Wait, another thought: red phosphorus and HI are used in the preparation of iodides from alcohols. The reaction typically converts primary alcohols to iodides via the formation of an intermediate ylide. So if compound X has an alcohol group, perhaps it would be converted into an iodide.

But looking back at the NMR, there's a broad peak at 10.5 ppm, which could be an -OH. So if X has an -OH group, such as a carboxylic acid, then reacting with red phosphorus and HI would perhaps not directly substitute that, unless it's a primary alcohol.

Wait, but X is a benzoic acid derivative. So the -COOH group would not react in that way. Alternatively, perhaps X has a hydroxyl group in the substituent.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3 group. But that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a secondary alcohol, which could undergo substitution with HI. But in the NMR, the -OH is at 10.5, which is more like a carboxylic acid.

Hmm, maybe I'm on the wrong track. Let me think about the reaction again.

Red phosphorus and HI is used in the substitution of alcohols to form iodides. So if X has an -OH group, perhaps it's a primary or secondary alcohol, and the reaction would replace the -OH with an iodide.

But in the NMR, the 10.5 ppm peak is a singlet, suggesting a single proton, probably an -OH. If X is a benzyl alcohol derivative, perhaps with a substituent that includes an -OH, then the reaction would substitute that.

But looking at the options, none of them have an iodide group. So perhaps the reaction is a substitution of a hydrogen in the substituent.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzyl alcohol derivative with a substituent that has an -OH group. For example, if the substituent is a propyl chain with an -OH, then the reaction would substitute that -OH with iodide.

But I'm not seeing that in the options. The options are either benzoic acids or substituted benzene rings.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where a hydrogen alpha to the carbonyl is replaced by iodide. For example, in a ketone, the alpha hydrogens can be substituted with iodide under certain conditions. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction involves the substitution of the carbonyl oxygen with iodide, but that's not a typical reaction I'm aware of.

Wait, but in the IR, the 1720 cm-1 peak is a strong carbonyl. So perhaps X is a ketone.

Wait, if X is a ketone, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI could be a nucleophilic substitution. For example, if the ketone has a good leaving group, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition or something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the carbonyl group to a methylene group. For example, using the Wolff-Kishner reaction, which reduces carbonyl groups (like ketones) to methylene groups, releasing CO2 and NH3 (if using hydrazine). But in this case, the reagents are red phosphorus and HI. Wait, the Wolff-Kishner typically uses hydrazine, heat, and strong base, but perhaps a variation uses HI and red phosphorus.

In that case, the ketone would be converted into a methylene group. So, if X is a ketone, the product would have a CH2 group where the carbonyl was.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If X is a ketone, say 4-(sec-butyl)benzophenone, then treatment with red phosphorus and HI would reduce the ketone to CH2, giving 4-(sec-butyl)benzene with a CH2 group where the ketone was. But that doesn't match any of the options. The options given don't have a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me re-examine the options.

Option A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: That would have a propanoic acid group attached to a 4-ethylphenyl group.

Option B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: That's a toluene derivative with isobutyl and methyl groups.

Option C)4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: Benzene with COOH and sec-butyl.

Option D)1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: Benzene with sec-butyl and methyl in para.

Wait, so if X is a ketone, and after reaction, it becomes an alkane, then for option C, the product would not fit. So perhaps X is a ketone.

Wait, another approach: let's think about what each option would look like before reaction.

If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), then reacting with red phosphorus and HI would have to produce one of the other options.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution of the -COOH group.

Wait, another reaction: the Hell–Volhard–Zelinskii reaction adds bromine to the alpha position of a carboxylic acid, but I don't think that's relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the -COOH is replaced. But that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the carboxylic acid to a CH2OH group, but that's not typically done with red phosphorus and HI.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH is converted into an iodide. But I'm not familiar with such a reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzyl alcohol derivative. For example, if X has a hydroxyl group in the substituent, then red phosphorus and HI would substitute that -OH with iodide.

Looking at the NMR, the 10.5 ppm peak could be an -OH. So if X is a benzyl alcohol with a substituent that has an -OH, then the reaction would substitute that -OH with iodide.

But none of the options have iodide groups, so perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where a hydrogen adjacent to the carbonyl is replaced by iodide. For example, in a ketone, the alpha hydrogens could be substituted, leading to a diiodide or mono-iodide.

But again, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps we should consider the reaction conditions again. Red phosphorus and HI can also be used to deoxygenate certain functional groups. For example, they can be used to convert alcohols to alkanes by deoxygenation. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the substitution of a hydrogen adjacent to the carbonyl group.

Wait, another thought: If X is a benzaldehyde derivative, then the reaction with HI and red phosphorus might lead to the formation of an iodide via the substitution of the aldehyde proton. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the substitution of a hydrogen in the substituent's CH group. For example, if X has a CH group adjacent to the carbonyl, then the hydrogen on that CH could be substituted with iodide.

But again, the options don't have iodide groups, so perhaps that's not the case.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of each option and see what reaction would produce them.

The question is, when X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, which product do we get.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If X is a different compound, say, a benzaldehyde, then reaction could produce this.

Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere. Another approach: perhaps X is a benzaldehyde, and the reaction reduces the aldehyde to a CH2I group. But that doesn't fit any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a phenylacetone (acetophenone), and the reaction reduces the ketone to a CH2 group, leading to a product like toluene derivative.

But none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the substituent's hydrogen is replaced by iodide. For example, in the substituent CH(CH3)CH2CH3, perhaps a hydrogen is replaced by iodide. But again, the options don't include iodide.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH is converted into a methyl group, but that doesn't make sense with the given reagents.

Wait, another thought: red phosphorus and HI can also be used to prepare acylium salts, which can undergo various reactions, but I'm not sure how that applies here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH is converted into a bromide or iodide, but I don't recall such a reaction.

Wait, perhaps I should focus on the structure of X and what the reaction does.

If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), and it reacts with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the reaction deprotonates the -COOH and replaces it with iodide. But that would form a benzene ring with a iodide and a sec-butyl group. But none of the options match that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH group is replaced with an -O-PO(OI)3 group, but that's probably not relevant.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the reaction conditions. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the preparation of acylium salts. Alternatively, in the presence of a carbonyl group, red phosphorus can form a ylide, which can then undergo various reactions, perhaps nucleophilic substitutions.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the substitution of the carbonyl oxygen with iodide. For example, converting a ketone into an iodide. But that's not a common reaction, and I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of the carbonyl group to a methylene group, but that would require a different set of reagents, typically hydrazine and heat.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the hydrogen on the CH adjacent to the carbonyl is replaced by iodide. For example, in a ketone, the alpha hydrogen could be substituted. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction conditions are for the formation of a benzene ring with a substituent that's an iodide. But I'm not seeing how that would fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzyl alcohol, and the reaction converts the -OH into -I. But in that case, the product would have an -I group, which isn't in the options.

Hmm, perhaps I should think back to the initial analysis of X's structure. Let me re-express that.

From the NMR, X has:

- Aromatic protons: two doublets, suggesting para substitution with electron-withdrawing and donating groups.

- A broad peak at 10.5 ppm, likely -OH (carboxylic acid).

- A CH adjacent to carbonyl (2.9 ppm), CH2 groups, and a methyl group.

So X is likely 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C).

Now, when X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what happens? Perhaps the reaction is the substitution of the -COOH group.

Wait, but how? Red phosphorus and HI are not typically used to substitute carboxylic acids.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the carboxylic acid to a methylene group. But that requires more vigorous conditions, like the Wolff-Kishner, which uses hydrazine and heat.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution within the substituent. For example, if the substituent has a good leaving group, like a tosylate, but in this case, X doesn't have that.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's think about the reaction again. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the substitution of alcohols to form iodides. So if X has an -OH group in the substituent, perhaps it's a secondary or tertiary alcohol, and the reaction would substitute the -OH with -I.

Looking at the substituent, the NMR has a 2.9 ppm (m,1H), which could be an -OH if it's a secondary alcohol. But wait, the 10.5 ppm is a broad peak, which is more like a carboxylic acid -OH. So perhaps the substituent's CH has an -OH group, but that's not indicated in the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group, and the reaction is a reduction.

If X is a ketone, like 4-(sec-butyl)benzophenone, then reaction with red phosphorus and HI would reduce the ketone to a CH2 group, leading to 4-(sec-butyl)toluene. But that would be option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Wait, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which would have a methyl group in position 4 and a sec-butyl in position 1. Or wait, no, the numbering might be different.

Wait, if the substituent was a ketone at position 1 and a methyl at position 4, then after reduction, the ketone becomes a CH2 group. So the product would have a CH2 group at position 1 and a methyl at position 4. But that doesn't match any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a benzaldehyde, and the reaction reduces the aldehyde to a CH2I group. But that's not something I'm familiar with.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH is replaced by an iodide. But that doesn't fit the options either.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So X is option C. What reaction would X undergo with red phosphorus and HI?

If X is benzoic acid with a substituent, perhaps the reaction is a substitution of the -COOH group. But I'm not sure how that would proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the conversion of the -COOH into a methyl group. But I don't think red phosphorus and HI do that.

Wait, perhaps X is not a carboxylic acid but a ketone. Let me reevaluate that.

The IR peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl. If it's a ketone, then the 10.5 ppm peak might not be an -OH but perhaps an aldehyde. But the aldehyde's proton would typically appear around 9-10 ppm as a singlet or a doublet. However, the broadness suggests it's not an aldehyde but something else, like an -OH.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the 10.5 ppm is an exchangeable proton, like an -OH from a hydroxyl group in the substituent. For example, if the substituent is a secondary alcohol, like CH(CH3)CH2OH, then the -OH would appear as a broad peak around 10 ppm.

In that case, X would have a substituent with a secondary alcohol group. Then, treatment with red phosphorus and HI would substitute the -OH with -I, leading to a sec-butyl iodide substituent.

But none of the options include iodide. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, another thought: if X is a ketone, and the reaction is a reduction to a methylene group, then the product would have a CH2 group where the ketone was. So if X was 4-(sec-butyl)benzophenone, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which is option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

So, looking at option D: it's benzene with a methyl group at position 4 and a sec-butyl group at position 1.

Wait, but in the reaction, the ketone at position 1 would be reduced to a CH2 group connected to the ring, giving a methyl group (CH3) at position 1. So the product would have a methyl at position 1 and a sec-butyl at position 4? Or wait, perhaps the starting material is 4-sec-butylacetophenone (position 1 is the ketone, position 4 is the sec-butyl).

After reduction, the ketone becomes a methyl group. So the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which is 1-methyl-4-(sec-butyl)benzene. That would correspond to option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

Wait, but the positions might be mixed up. Let me clarify.

If X is 4-(sec-butyl)acetophenone (i.e., the ketone is at position 1, and the sec-butyl is at position 4), then after reduction, the ketone becomes a methyl group, and the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which is 1-methyl-4-(sec-butyl)benzene. That matches option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

So, the reaction would convert the ketone into a methyl group. Therefore, the product is option D.

Wait, but earlier analysis suggested that X is a benzoic acid, but if the reaction requires X to be a ketone, then perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis.

Wait, let's re-examine X's structure. If X is a ketone, the IR would show a carbonyl peak around 1720 cm-1, which fits. The NMR would not have a broad peak at 10.5 ppm, unless it's an aldehyde. But if X is a ketone, where is the aldehyde proton? There isn't one. So perhaps the 10.5 ppm is not an -OH but something else.

Wait, another possibility: the 10.5 ppm peak is an acidic proton, like an aldehyde. Aldehydes show up around 9-10 ppm. But the peak is broad, which is more typical for an -OH. Alternatively, perhaps it's an exchange with the aldehyde proton, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is an aromatic aldehyde, like benzaldehyde. Then, the NMR would have a singlet around 10 ppm for the aldehyde proton. The aromatic protons would be around 7.5-8.5 ppm. But in the given NMR, the aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm, which might fit.

But then, the other signals (2.9, 1.7, etc.) would correspond to a substituent chain. So if X is benzaldehyde with a substituent like a sec-butyl group, then the substituent would have those signals.

But in that case, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would reduce the aldehyde to a CH2 group. So the product would be toluene with a substituent.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the substitution of a hydrogen in the substituent. For example, if the substituent has a CH2 group, the reaction could substitute one of the hydrogens with iodide.

But since none of the options have iodide, perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an Grignard reagent, but that doesn't fit here.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Let me try to think of what each option would look like after the reaction.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If X is this, and the reaction reduces the -COOH group to a CH2 group, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which is option D.

Wait, how would the -COOH group be reduced? With red phosphorus and HI, perhaps it's not possible. But if X is a ketone, then yes.

Alternatively, perhaps X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzaldehyde, and the reaction reduces the aldehyde to a CH2 group, making 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which is option D.

So, putting it all together, I think X is a ketone, and the reaction reduces it to a methyl group, leading to option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying the final product when compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The analysis begins by interpreting the IR and NMR data of X to determine its structure.

### IR Analysis:
- The broad peak between **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** suggests an -OH group, likely from a carboxylic acid.
- The strong peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** indicates a carbonyl group, consistent with a ketone or carboxylic acid.
- Peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** suggest aromatic C=C stretching, indicating a benzene ring.

### NMR Analysis:
- **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: A broad singlet, likely an -OH proton from a carboxylic acid.
- **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets, characteristic of a para-substituted benzene ring with electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups.
- **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: A multiplet, likely a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl.
- **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: A multiplet, likely CH₂ groups in a chain.
- **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: A doublet, likely a methyl group attached to a CH.
- **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet, likely a terminal methyl group in an ethyl chain.

### Structure of X:
The IR and NMR data suggest that X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. The benzene ring has a carboxylic acid group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4. The sec-butyl group consists of a CH adjacent to the carbonyl, CH₂ groups, and methyl groups.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
Red phosphorus and HI are typically used to reduce carbonyl groups (e.g., ketones, aldehydes) to methylene groups. However, in this case, the reaction reduces the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃), resulting in the formation of **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**. This product has a methyl group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4, consistent with option D.

### Conclusion:
The final product of the reaction is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.
