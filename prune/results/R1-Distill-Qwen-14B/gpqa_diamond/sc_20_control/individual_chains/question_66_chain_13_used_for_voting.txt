Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, or SMEFT. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's try to think this through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates all possible higher-dimensional operators consistent with the Standard Model symmetries. So the operators in SMEFT should respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model itself.

Let me break down each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: This is the combination of rotations and boosts, ensuring that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames. I think the Standard Model respects Lorentz symmetry, so SMEFT operators must also respect this. Operators should be Lorentz-invariant.

2. **Poincare Symmetry**: This includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (like shifting position in space-time). Poincare symmetry implies momentum conservation. Since the Standard Model includes this, SMEFT operators must respect Poincare symmetry as well. But wait, is Poincare symmetry automatically included if Lorentz symmetry is? Because Poincare includes translations, which are part of the symmetry in the Standard Model. So if an operator respects Lorentz symmetry, it must also respect Poincare?

Hmm, but wait, operators in SMEFT are classified by their dimension and the representations of the fields. Each operator must be a Lorentz scalar, which inherently respects Lorentz symmetry. And since the theory is built in a way that maintains Poincare symmetry, I'm thinking that if an operator respects Lorentz symmetry, it automatically respects Poincare as well, because it's part of the same framework.

3. **CP Symmetry**: CP stands for Charge conjugation and Parity. The Standard Model isn't CP-symmetric overall because of processes like CP violation in the CKM matrix. But individual operators in the Standard Model respect CP, except where CP violation is explicitly present. Wait, but in effective theories like SMEFT, do the operators have to respect CP symmetry?

Wait, no. The SMEFT includes all operators that are allowed by the Standard Model's gauge symmetry. But the Standard Model itself doesn't have CP as a symmetry, so operators in SMEFT can violate CP. So operators in SMEFT don't have to respect CP symmetry. So operators might violate CP, meaning that not all operators must respect it. Therefore, if the question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators, then CP isn't a must. So option 3 is incorrect for the question.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT is Charge, Parity, Time reversal. The Standard Model (and thus SMEFT) respects CPT symmetry. Any operator in SMEFT must respect CPT because it's a fundamental symmetry of quantum field theory. So all operators must respect CPT.

So putting it together: which symmetries must all operators respect?

- 1: Lorentz symmetry – yes, must be respected.
- 2: Poincare symmetry – since it's part of the framework, and operators are Lorentz scalars, which are part of Poincare. So yes.
Wait, but wait: Poincare symmetry includes translations, so for a term like a higher-dimensional operator (e.g., (1/Lambda) φ F F), does it necessarily respect Poincare? Because the operator must be a scalar, which includes all Poincare symmetries.

Wait, so if all operators are Lorentz scalars, then they automatically transform appropriately under Poincare, including translations. So yes, operators respect Poincare symmetry.

So 1 and 2 are both required, right?

Wait, but wait: SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so all operators must be Lorentz scalars. Therefore, they respect Lorentz symmetry. And since the theory includes Poincare symmetry (the SM does, so SMEFT must), the operators must respect that. So options 1 and 2 must be respected.

But the question is about which must be respected by all operators. So 1 and 2 are in.

Wait, but let me think again: Poincare includes translations, which are part of the symmetry. So any operator must be invariant under Poincare, which includes Lorentz and translations. So if an operator is a Lorentz scalar, does it automatically respect Poincare? Not entirely sure. Maybe not necessarily. Because, for example, a term with a derivative would affect translation invariance. Wait, but in QFT, all terms are translation-invariant because the operators are local. So all operators in the Lagrangian are translation-invariant, which is part of Poincare.

So I think yes, SMEFT operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries.

Wait, but wait: Poincare is a bigger symmetry group. Lorentz symmetry is a subgroup of Poincare. So if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. But the question is about which must be respected by all operators. So if all SMEFT operators must respect Poincare, then Lorentz is automatically respected. But in reality, SMEFT operators must be Lorentz scalars, but they're part of a theory that's Poincare-invariant. So perhaps both 1 and 2 are correct.

Hmm. But the way the options are presented, let's see the options. Choice A is 1 and 2. So that would include both Lorentz and Poincare.

But wait, the question is which must be "respected by all operators". So the operators must be invariant under the symmetry. So for Lorentz, all operators must be Lorentz scalars. For Poincare, which includes translations, the operators must be invariant under translations. Since the operators are part of the Lagrangian, which is translation-invariant, then yes, each operator is translation-invariant.

So both 1 and 2 are correct.

Now, 3: CP symmetry. As I thought earlier, the SMEFT can include operators that violate CP because the Standard Model itself allows for CP violation. So operators in SMEFT don't have to respect CP. So 3 is not a must.

4: CPT symmetry. Since CPT is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory, any operator must respect CPT. So yes, 4 must be respected.

So now, the required symmetries are 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT).

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think about Poincare symmetry again. The Poincare group includes Lorentz transformations and translations. So, the operators in SMEFT are scalars under the Lorentz group, and the theory is invariant under translations (since the Lagrangian is). Therefore, each operator must be a scalar under Lorentz and invariant under translations, so each operator respects Poincare symmetry.

So yes, 1 and 2 are both required.

So the symmetries that must be respected by all operators are 1, 2, and 4.

Looking at the options:

Option C: 1,2,4 → which would be correct if that's the case.

Wait, but the options are:

A) 1,2 → So only Lorentz and Poincare.

Wait, no. Wait, Poincare is a bigger symmetry, but if the SMEFT is a Poincare-invariant theory, then all operators respect Poincare. So we have to include Poincare as a must.

So the correct symmetries are 1,2,4.

Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. But wait, option C is choice C: 1,2,4.

Wait, but wait: Let me think again. The question is which of the following symmetries must be respected. So all operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. But what about the C in CPT?

Wait, CPT is a composite symmetry. But the point is, all operators in a QFT must respect CPT symmetry. So 4 is correct.

Thus, the correct options are 1,2,4. So the answer would be option C.

Wait, but wait, looking back at the options:

Options are:

A)1,2

B)3,4

C)1,2,4

D)1,3,4

So option C is 1,2,4. So that would be the right choice.

But wait, I'm a bit confused about whether Poincare symmetry is included in the SMEFT operators' requirements. Because I thought that the operators are written as Lorentz scalars, which are part of the Poincare symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Since the Standard Model is a Poincare-invariant theory, the effective theory must also be Poincare-invariant, so all operators must be Poincare scalars. So 2 is correct.

So the answer is C:1,2,4.

To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we analyze each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant effective field theory, meaning all operators must be Lorentz scalars. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry must be respected by all operators.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translation invariance. Since SMEFT is built as a Poincaré-invariant theory, all operators must respect Poincaré symmetry, including translation invariance.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model (and thus SMEFT) does not strictly respect CP symmetry due to CP violation in processes like the CKM matrix. Therefore, operators in SMEFT do not need to respect CP symmetry, and it is not a requirement.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory, and SMEFT, being an effective field theory, respects CPT symmetry. Thus, all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: C
