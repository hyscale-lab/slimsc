Okay, I've got this NMR and LC-MS question in front of me. Let me try to think it through step by step. Hmm, so the scenario is about a small peptidic compound that's been synthesized. The 1H NMR shows some unexpected peaks. And the LC-MS also shows two peaks. I need to figure out what's going on.

So, the NMR part: the 1H spectrum for the crude compound looks mostly as expected except for two peaks that both belong to the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. So, each is about half a proton. The coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling as the cause. Wait, spin-spin coupling would lead to splitting between different protons, right? So if two peaks are from the same proton, maybe something else is causing them.

And then, the LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature shows two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass, which matches the expected molecule. So, same mass, same retention time? Or same mass but different? Wait, the question says the same mass spectrum. Oh, wait, the same mass, but in LC-MS, the same mass would mean same molecular weight. Hmm.

So, what could cause the same molecular weight but different peaks in LC-MS? Maybe isomers—like diastereomers or enantiomers. Because diastereomers would have different retention times in LC (since they might interact differently with the column), but same mass. Enantiomers, on the other hand, would have the same retention time because they're mirror images and might not be separated unless the column is chiral.

But in the question, the LC-MS shows two peaks. So it's possible that the LC is a chiral column, which can separate enantiomers, giving two peaks. Or maybe the compounds are diastereomers, which would have different retention times even without a chiral column.

Looking at the options:

A) Contaminated with a precursor. If it's a precursor, the mass would be different—since it's a smaller molecule, perhaps. But the question says the mass is consistent with the expected molecule. So probably not A.

B) Mixture of enantiomers. If the compound is a racemic mixture, then in LC-MS, if the column is chiral, you'd see two peaks. But wait, the question says the LC-MS analysis was done at elevated temperature. Oh, wait, sometimes high temps can cause racemization? Or maybe the mobile phase conditions affect the separation. But if it's a racemic mixture, even on a regular column, you might not get separation. Unless it's a chiral column. Hmm. But the problem says both peaks have the same mass, which would make sense for enantiomers.

C) Double coupling during an amide bond formation. That's a bit unclear to me. Double coupling would imply that the proton is coupling with two different sets of protons, maybe? But the question says the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. So why would double coupling happen? Maybe during the reaction, some kind of double bond formation or something else. Not sure. Or perhaps during the amide bond formation, there's some kind of stereochemistry leading to coupling, but I'm not certain.

D) Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so they'd have different NMR shifts and different retention times in LC. But wait, in the NMR they have two peaks for the same alpha-proton. How does that happen? Let's think about diastereomers. If there are two diastereomers with the same alpha-proton in different environments, but perhaps they're in a ratio. But wait, the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton. That could happen if the proton is in different environments in each isomer.

Wait, but if the molecule is a diastereomer, each diastereomer would have its own set of protons. If the alpha-proton has a different environment in each diastereomer, their chemical shifts would be different. But in this case, the two peaks are similar, so maybe the diastereomers are similar enough in that proton's environment that their shifts are close. But why would the integrals add up to 1H? Because the mixture is 50:50, perhaps?

But wait, the question says the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton, each integrating to about 0.5H. So if it's a 50:50 mixture of diastereomers, each has an alpha proton, so the integral would sum to 1H. But in each diastereomer, the alpha-proton's chemical shift is similar, so the two would be close. That could explain the two peaks.

Alternatively, if it's a racemic mixture (enantiomers), then each enantiomer would have an alpha-proton in the same environment, so they should have the same chemical shift. But wait, that's not the case, because in enantiomers, the protons are in mirror image environments but same in terms of shift. So if the molecule is chiral, and you have a racemic mixture, the NMR would show one peak for a proton because enantiomers have the same NMR. Unless something else is causing the splitting.

Wait, but the question said the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. Spin-spin coupling would be between different protons, like splitting due to neighboring J-coupled protons. But if the same proton is split into two, that might be something else.

Wait, another possibility: if the compound has an internal plane of symmetry but in a mixture, like in a diastereomeric mixture, perhaps the alpha protons are in environments that lead to two distinct peaks.

Alternatively, maybe the crude compound has some other issue, like tautomers or conformers. But conformers usually don't split into distinct peaks because they interconvert quickly on the NMR timescale.

Wait, another thought: during the formation of an amide bond, sometimes the reaction can lead to different stereochemistry. For example, the formation of an amide can lead to different diastereomers if the starting materials are not pure. So perhaps option C is about forming a diastereomer mixture due to the reaction conditions. But the question says it's a double coupling during amide bond formation. Hmm, not sure about that.

So, the options are:

If the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton, same integral (so 50:50), but same mass in LC-MS.

If it's enantiomers, the NMR should show a single peak because the environments are the same. Unless... Wait, no. Enantiomers have identical NMR spectra because they're mirror images. So if the crude compound is a racemic mixture, the NMR would show a single peak for each proton. So that can't explain the two peaks for the same alpha-proton.

So option B (enantiomers) leads to single peaks, so that's probably not the case.

Option D, diastereomers: each diastereomer has its own set of NMR peaks. If the mixture is 50:50, and the alpha-proton in each is split into two, each with similar shifts, then the overall integral would be 1H. But why are the shifts similar? Well, perhaps the diastereomers are in a configuration where that particular proton is in a very similar environment, but not identical. So their shifts are close but not the same.

So, in the 1H NMR, each diastereomer would contribute a peak for the alpha-proton, but since they're in a 50:50 mix, the peaks would add up. Their shifts are similar, so they appear as two close peaks.

In the LC-MS, the diastereomers would have different retention times (unless the column is not separating them for some reason), but the problem states that the LC-MS shows two peaks of equal intensity and same mass. Oh wait, same mass would make sense for diastereomers, because their molecular weights are the same. So they would have the same m/z in MS.

So if the LC can separate them (if they have different retention times), then you get two peaks with same mass. So that fits option D.

Option C: double coupling during amide bond formation. I'm not exactly sure what that means. Maybe some sort of coupling that causes each alpha proton to split into two. But the question says coupling pattern rules out spin-spin, so maybe it's a different kind of coupling? I don't know much about this. Perhaps during the reaction, two different products form with similar structures, leading to the same mass but different enough structures to cause splitting in NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to some isomerization, like an amide with different stereochemistry.

Wait, another thought: sometimes when the amide bond is formed, if the reaction isn't complete, you might have some starting material left. But the question says the NMR is consistent with expected, except for these two peaks. So probably not.

So, putting it all together: the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton. That suggests that the proton is in two different environments. Equal integral implies a 50:50 mixture. The same mass in LC-MS suggests the same molecular formula, so same molar mass. So diastereomers or enantiomers. But enantiomers would have the same NMR, so that's out. Diastereomers would have different NMR shifts, but if the alpha-proton's shifts are close, perhaps due to similar environments. So two diastereomers with same mass but different structures, leading to two NMR peaks for the same proton.

So the most likely explanation is that the crude compound is a mixture of diastereoisomers, option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves analyzing a small peptidic compound where the 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton, with similar chemical shifts and equal integrals (summing to 1H). The LC-MS analysis reveals two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass, consistent with the expected molecule. The goal is to determine the most likely explanation for these observations.

### Key Observations and Analysis:
1. **1H NMR Spectrum**:
   - Two peaks for the same alpha-proton suggest the proton is in two distinct environments, likely due to a mixture of isomers.
   - The integrals of the peaks sum to 1H, indicating a 50:50 mixture of two components.

2. **LC-MS Analysis**:
   - Two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass indicate the presence of two compounds with the same molecular weight but different physical properties.
   - This suggests the compounds are isomers (either enantiomers or diastereomers).

3. **Coupling Pattern**:
   - The coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling as the cause of the two peaks in the NMR spectrum.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A (Contaminated with a precursor)**:
  - A precursor would have a different molecular weight, leading to a different mass in the LC-MS spectrum. This does not match the observations, so this option is unlikely.

- **Option B (Mixture of enantiomers)**:
  - Enantiomers have identical NMR spectra because they are mirror images and share the same chemical environments. Thus, the NMR would show a single peak for the alpha-proton, not two peaks. This option does not explain the observations.

- **Option C ('Double coupling' during amide-bond forming reaction)**:
  - The question specifies that the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. While "double coupling" could theoretically occur, this explanation is less likely compared to a straightforward mixture of isomers.

- **Option D (Mixture of diastereoisomers)**:
  - Diastereomers have different physical properties, leading to distinct NMR shifts and different retention times in LC-MS. If the mixture is 50:50, the NMR would show two peaks for the alpha-proton, each integrating to 0.5H, as observed. The LC-MS would show two peaks with the same mass but different retention times, consistent with the data. This is the most plausible explanation.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers, as this accounts for the observations in both the NMR and LC-MS analyses.
