Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Let me try to think it through step by step. 

The problem says there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity's center is a distance s from the conductor's center, and the cavity has radius r, which is less than R. Then, someone places a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. The question is asking about the electric field E at a point P located outside the conductor. 

Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and the distance from P to the cavity's center is l. Also, l and L are both larger than R. The angle between l and s is theta. 

Hmm, I remember that in electrostatics, the behavior of charges in conductors leads to certain field configurations. Since the conductor is uncharged, but there's a charge inside the cavity, I think the charges in the conductor would redistribute. Wait, but since it's a conductor, the charges would move until the interior field is zero? Or is that only the case when the conductor is a shell without any enclosed charges?

Wait, the conductor is neutral, but a charge is placed inside the cavity. I think this setup is similar to the case of a spherical capacitor or maybe a conductor with an internal charge. I remember that when a charge is inside a cavity of a conductor, it induces charges on the inner surface. The conductor itself remains neutral, so the inner surface would have an induced charge of -q, and the outer surface would have +q to balance it out. Wait no, wait. The conductor is neutral overall, so the inner surface must have charge -q, and the outer surface +q to make the total zero. But wait, the total charge on the conductor is zero. So if the inner surface has -q, the outer must have +q, so that they cancel each other plus the original charge +q? No, wait, the conductor was initially neutral. So the charge inside the cavity is +q. The conductor will have induced charges on the inner surface of -q. Since the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have +q, right? Because the total conductor's charge is the sum of inner and outer surfaces. So (-q) from inner and +q from outer gives zero, which matches the conductor being neutral. 

Now, the electric field outside the conductor should be the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. That's because, from Gauss's law, the field outside a spherical conductor only depends on the total enclosed charge. So in this case, the total charge on the conductor is +q on the outside. But wait, no, the conductor's outer surface has +q. So yes, the field outside would be as if you have a point charge +q at the center of the conductor. 

But wait, point P is outside the conductor, so the field at P should depend only on the total charge outside, which is +q. So the electric field would be (1/(4πε0)) * q / L², because L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P.

Looking at the options, option B is (1/(4πε0)) * q / L². That seems to fit what I was thinking. 

But wait, I should double-check. What about the position of the cavity? Since the cavity is off-center, does that affect the external field? I think not, because the charges on the conductor's outer surface would adjust themselves in such a way that the external field is the same as if all charge were at the center. The internal arrangement (like the inner induced charge) doesn't influence the external field. So the position of the cavity's center s and the angle theta shouldn't matter for the external field. So the E at point P is just due to the total charge at the center, which is +q. 

So the formula is E = (1/(4πε0)) * q / L², which is option B.

The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity of radius $r$ inside it. The cavity is offset from the center of the conductor by a distance $s$, and a small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity. The task is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ located outside the conductor, at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The distance from $P$ to the center of the cavity is $l$, and the angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$. 

Key points to consider:

1. **Charge Distribution in the Conductor**: Since the conductor is initially neutral, the presence of the charge $+q$ inside the cavity induces an equal and opposite charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor. To maintain charge neutrality, the outer surface of the conductor must then have a charge $+q$.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: From Gauss's law, the electric field outside a spherical conductor depends only on the total enclosed charge. In this case, the total charge on the conductor's outer surface is $+q$. The position of the cavity (offset by $s$) and the angle $\theta$ do not affect the external field because the charges on the outer surface redistribute to ensure that the field outside the conductor is as if all the charge were concentrated at the center.

3. **Magnitude of the Electric Field**: At point $P$, which is outside the conductor, the electric field is determined solely by the total charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor. Using Coulomb's law, the magnitude of the electric field is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}
   \]
   where $L$ is the distance from the center of the conductor to point $P$.

4. **Relevance of Other Parameters**: The distance $l$, the angle $\theta$, and the offset $s$ are irrelevant for determining the external field, as the field outside the conductor is independent of the internal configuration of the cavity.

From the given options, the correct expression for the electric field at point $P$ is:
\[
E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}
\]
