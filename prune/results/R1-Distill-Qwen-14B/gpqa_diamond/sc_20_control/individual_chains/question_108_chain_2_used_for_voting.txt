Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

The question says that the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis and has a value of 1 Tesla. The orbital magnetic quantum number m is small. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the orbital magnetic quantum number m can take values from -l to +l, where l is the azimuthal quantum number. But since the problem says m is small, maybe we're considering cases where m is near zero or something like that?

So, the problem is asking me to compare the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term (which I think is the energy due to the interaction of the magnetic field with the magnetic moment of the electron) with the transition energy ΔE of a hydrogen atom. The given wavelength is 0.4861 micrometers, which I think is related to the Balmer series. Oh right, the Balmer-alpha line is at about 0.486 micrometers, so that's the H-alpha line, which corresponds to a transition from n=3 to n=2 in hydrogen.

First, I need to calculate the transition energy ΔE. The energy levels of hydrogen are given by the Rydberg formula. The Rydberg constant R is approximately 13.6 eV for hydrogen. The formula for the energy levels is E_n = -R / n². So, for a transition from n_i to n_f, the energy difference ΔE is E_i - E_f.

Wait, the transition is from a higher energy level to a lower one, so E_i would be less negative than E_f. So ΔE would be E_f - E_i. Let's compute that.

Let me think, the wavelength λ is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1 nm. The Rydberg formula in terms of wavelength is 1/λ = R (1/n_f² - 1/n_i²). Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, when an electron transitions from a higher energy level (n_i) to a lower one (n_f), it emits a photon with wavelength λ. So, 1/λ = R (1/n_f² - 1/n_i²). Since m is small, and for the Balmer series, n_f is 2. So n_i must be 3 because the Balmer-alpha line is n=3 to n=2.

So plugging in the numbers: n_f =2, n_i=3. So 1/λ = R (1/2² - 1/3²) = R(1/4 -1/9) = R*(5/36). Let me compute that.

But wait, the Rydberg constant R is approximately 1.097e4 m^-1. So 1/λ = (1.097e4) * (5/36). Let me calculate 5/36 first. 5 divided by 36 is approximately 0.1389. So 1.097e4 multiplied by 0.1389 is about 1.528e3 m^-1. So 1/λ ≈ 1.528e3 m^-1, so λ is approximately 1/1.528e3 ≈ 0.000654 meters, which is 654 nm. Wait, but the given wavelength is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1 nm. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake here because the calculation gives a longer wavelength than that. Wait, maybe I should double-check the Rydberg formula.

Wait no, I must have mixed up the formula. Let me think again: The Rydberg formula for the hydrogen emission lines is 1/λ = R (1/n_f² - 1/n_i²), where n_i > n_f. For the Balmer-alpha line, n_i is 3 and n_f is 2. So 1/λ = R (1/4 - 1/9) = R (5/36). Let me calculate that correctly.

R is approximately 1.097e7 m^-1, wait, no. Wait, the Rydberg constant R is about 1.097e4 per meter? Or wait, no. Wait, I think R is about 1.097e4 per meter? Or is it 1.097e7 per meter? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me recall: the Rydberg constant is approximately 1.097e4 m^-1. So 1.097e4 m^-1 multiplied by 5/36.

So 1.097e4 * (5/36) ≈ 1.097e4 * 0.1389 ≈ 1.527e3 m^-1. So 1/λ ≈ 1.527e3 m^-1 → λ ≈ 1/(1.527e3) ≈ 0.000655 meters, which is 655 nm. But the given wavelength is 486.1 nm, which is shorter. Hmm, that suggests that maybe n_i is 4 and n_f is 2, or another pair? Oh wait, no, perhaps I've mixed up the formula. Because sometimes the Rydberg formula is written as 1/λ = R (1/n_f² - 1/n_i²) for emission when n_i > n_f.

Wait, let me double-check the hydrogen spectrum. Oh right, the Balmer-alpha line is at 656 nm (red), but in the problem, the wavelength is 0.4861 micrometers, which is about 486 nm, which is the Balmer-beta line, which is the second line in the Balmer series. Oh, wait, no. Wait, Balmer-alpha is n=3 to n=2, which is about 656 nm, Balmer-beta is n=4→n=2, which is about 486 nm. So that makes sense.

So in that case, the transition is from n_i=4 to n_f=2. So let me compute that correctly.

1/λ = R (1/2² - 1/4²) = R (1/4 - 1/16) = R (3/16). So R is 1.097e4 m^-1. So 3/16 is 0.1875. So 1.097e4 * 0.1875 ≈ 2053 m^-1.

Thus, λ = 1 / 2053 ≈ 0.0004864 meters, which is 486.4 nm. Ah, that matches the given λ=0.4861 micrometers (which is 486.1 nm). So that's correct.

So, the transition is from n=4 to n=2, so let's compute ΔE.

ΔE = E_initial - E_final. Wait, wait no: the energy levels are E_n = -13.6 eV / n². So E_initial is at n=4: E_4 = -13.6 eV / 16 ≈ -0.85 eV. E_final is at n=2: E_2 = -13.6 /4 = -3.4 eV. So the energy difference is E_final - E_initial = (-3.4) - (-0.85) = -3.4 + 0.85 = -2.55 eV. But the magnitude of the energy difference is 2.55 eV.

Wait, but for the transition energy ΔE, we take the absolute value. So ΔE is 2.55 eV.

Wait, but 1 eV is 1.6e-19 joules. So ΔE = 2.55 eV = 2.55 * 1.6e-19 J ≈ 4.08e-19 J.

Now, moving on to the paramagnetic coupling term. The paramagnetic term is the energy due to the magnetic interaction. I think the Hamiltonian for the magnetic interaction is H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment.

But wait, the paramagnetic term is usually the Zeeman term. The Zeeman effect arises from the interaction between the magnetic moment of the electron and the external magnetic field. The energy is given by H_Zeeman = -μ·B. The magnetic moment μ for an electron is given by μ = -g_s * μ_B * m_s, where g_s is the Landé g-factor, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m_s is the spin magnetic quantum number. But wait, wait, in the orbital Zeeman effect, the magnetic moment comes from the orbital angular momentum, not the spin. Or wait, the orbital magnetic quantum number is l, but I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the paramagnetic term in hydrogen's fine structure arises from the interaction between the electron's orbital magnetic moment and the external field. The energy term is given by H_para = (μ_0/(4π)) * (μ_B^2) / (r^3) * something... Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Wait, the paramagnetic coupling is often considered as part of the fine structure, but maybe in this problem, it's the Zeeman effect.

Wait, the problem states the paramagnetic coupling term. Paramagnetic materials have electrons with parallel spins, but in this context, perhaps it's referring to the Zeeman effect, which splits spectral lines when an external magnetic field is applied.

The energy shift due to an external magnetic field for the Zeeman effect is given by ΔE_Zeeman = μ_B * B * m_l, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton, B is the magnetic field strength, and m_l is the orbital magnetic quantum number.

Wait, but wait, the orbital magnetic quantum number m has values from -l to +l, but the problem states that m is small. So perhaps m is near zero. That would mean the energy shift is small.

Let me think about the Bohr magneton. The Bohr magneton μ_B is approximately 9.274e-24 J/T. The magnetic field B here is 1 T.

So the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ would be proportional to m_l * μ_B * B.

Wait, but the exact expression is ΔE_para = μ_B * B * m_l. Since m_l is small, let's say m_l is 0, or perhaps 1 (but if m is small, maybe m is 0 or 1). Wait, but m is the orbital magnetic quantum number, which for a given l can be -l, ..., 0, ..., +l.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the typical magnitude of the paramagnetic term and compare it with the transition energy ΔE.

So let's compute the paramagnetic coupling term. Let's take m_l = 1 as an example, but since m is small, perhaps m=0. Then the paramagnetic term would be zero. Or maybe m=1, which is the smallest non-zero value.

Wait, but the problem says m is small. So perhaps m=0 or m=1.

Let me compute the paramagnetic term for m=1.

ΔE_para = μ_B * B * m.

So putting in the numbers: μ_B = 9.274e-24 J/T, B=1 T, m=1. So ΔE_para = 9.274e-24 * 1 * 1 = 9.274e-24 J.

But wait, that's per electron. Or wait, is this the correct expression? I think in the Zeeman effect, the energy shift is given by E = -μ·B. So μ is the magnetic moment, which is μ = m_l * μ_B, and B is the magnetic field. So E = - m_l μ_B B.

Wait, but the problem is about the paramagnetic coupling term. Alternatively, perhaps the paramagnetic coupling term is due to the interaction between the magnetic moments of the electron and the nucleus, but I'm not sure. Wait, paramagnetism usually refers to the effect due to the unpaired electrons' spin, but in this case, the magnetic field is applied, and we're considering the orbital contribution.

Wait, alternatively, maybe the paramagnetic term is due to the interaction between the electron's spin magnetic moment and the magnetic field. But in that case, the spin magnetic quantum number m_s can be ±1/2. So the energy shift would be ΔE_para = μ_B * B * m_s.

But the problem states it's the orbital magnetic quantum number m, so I think it's the orbital contribution. So m is for orbital angular momentum, not spin. So the paramagnetic coupling term would be ΔE_para = μ_B * B * m_l.

Wait, but what's the typical value of m_l? For example, in hydrogen, the possible l values are 0,1,2, etc. For each l, m can be -l to +l. So the maximum m is l, but if m is small, perhaps l is small as well, say l=0 or 1.

If l=0, m=0, so the paramagnetic term is zero. If l=1, m can be -1, 0, +1. So for m=1, the paramagnetic term is μ_B * B * 1 = 9.274e-24 J.

Now, let's compare this to the transition energy ΔE.

We found ΔE is about 4.08e-19 J (from 2.55 eV) when the transition is from n=4 to n=2.

So comparing the two: ΔE_para is about 1e-23 J? Wait, wait, no. Wait, μ_B is about 9.274e-24 J/T, so for m=1, ΔE_para is 9.274e-24 J.

So ΔE_para ≈ 9.27e-24 J and ΔE ≈4.08e-19 J.

So how do these compare? Let's see: 9.27e-24 divided by 4.08e-19 is approximately (9.27/4.08) * 1e-5 ≈ 2.27 * 1e-5 ≈ 2.27e-5.

So the paramagnetic term is about 2e-5 times the transition energy. So the paramagnetic term is much smaller than the transition energy.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Let me double-check.

Wait, the transition energy is in eV, and the paramagnetic term in J. Let me convert ΔE to joules correctly.

ΔE is 2.55 eV. 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So 2.55 eV = 2.55 * 1.602e-19 ≈ 4.08e-19 J. Correct.

The paramagnetic term is 9.27e-24 J for m=1. So yes, 9e-24 is much smaller than 4e-19.

But wait, the paramagnetic term might be considering other factors, like the fine structure. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the hyperfine structure, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the problem says 'paramagnetic coupling term', which is the term in the Hamiltonian due to the magnetic field. So, the paramagnetic term is the Zeeman term I was calculating.

So, the paramagnetic term is much smaller than the transition energy.

So the question is to compare the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ with ΔE. So, ⟨H⟩ is the expectation value of the Hamiltonian due to the magnetic field. So if ⟨H⟩ is the Zeeman shift, which is about 9.27e-24 J, and ΔE is 4.08e-19 J, then ⟨H⟩ is much smaller than ΔE.

Wait, but wait, the problem says that m is small. So perhaps m=0, which would make ⟨H⟩=0. Alternatively, m=1, which gives ⟨H⟩=9.27e-24 J. Either way, it's much smaller than ΔE of 4e-19 J.

So in this case, the paramagnetic coupling term is much less than the transition energy.

But wait, let me think about the magnitudes again. 4e-19 J is about 2.55 eV, and the paramagnetic term is about 9.27e-24 J, which is 0.00058 eV (since 1 eV is 1.6e-19 J). So 9.27e-24 J is 9.27e-24 / 1.6e-19 ≈ 5.8e-5 eV, which is 0.000058 eV. So the paramagnetic term is about 5.8e-5 eV, and the transition energy is about 2.55 eV. So the ratio is about 2.27e-5, which is about 0.00227%.

So the paramagnetic term is much, much smaller than the transition energy. So the paramagnetic term is much less than the transition energy.

So the options are:

A) ⟨H⟩ = ΔE → not possible, since they’re of different magnitudes.

B) ⟨H⟩ >> ΔE → No, because ⟨H⟩ is much smaller.

C) ⟨H⟩ << ΔE → Yes, this is correct.

D) ⟨H⟩ > ΔE → No.

So the correct answer is option C: ⟨H⟩ is much less than ΔE.

To compare the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom, we analyze the given data and perform the necessary calculations.

### Transition Energy (ΔE)
The wavelength of the emitted photon is given as \( \lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu \text{m} = 486.1 \, \text{nm} \). This corresponds to the Balmer-beta line, where the electron transitions from \( n_i = 4 \) to \( n_f = 2 \). The energy levels of hydrogen are given by:

\[
E_n = -\frac{R}{n^2}, \quad \text{where } R = 1.097 \times 10^4 \, \text{m}^{-1}.
\]

The transition energy is:

\[
\Delta E = E_f - E_i = -\frac{R}{n_f^2} + \frac{R}{n_i^2}.
\]

Substituting \( n_f = 2 \) and \( n_i = 4 \):

\[
\Delta E = -\frac{R}{2^2} + \frac{R}{4^2} = -\frac{R}{4} + \frac{R}{16} = -\frac{3R}{16}.
\]

Using \( R = 1.097 \times 10^7 \, \text{m}^{-1} \) (correcting for the Rydberg constant in terms of energy levels):

\[
\Delta E = -\frac{3 \cdot 1.097 \times 10^7}{16} \, \text{eV} \approx -2.55 \, \text{eV}.
\]

Converting to joules (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E \approx 2.55 \cdot 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \approx 4.08 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Paramagnetic Coupling Term
The paramagnetic coupling term arises from the interaction of the magnetic moment of the electron with the external magnetic field. For the orbital Zeeman effect, the energy shift is:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{para}} = \mu_B \cdot B \cdot m_l,
\]

where \( \mu_B = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \) is the Bohr magneton, \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \), and \( m_l \) is the orbital magnetic quantum number. Since \( m \) is small, we consider \( m_l = 1 \) (the smallest non-zero value):

\[
\Delta E_{\text{para}} = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Comparison
The transition energy is:

\[
\Delta E \approx 4.08 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J},
\]

and the paramagnetic coupling term is:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{para}} \approx 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}.
\]

To compare their magnitudes:

\[
\frac{\Delta E_{\text{para}}}{\Delta E} = \frac{9.274 \times 10^{-24}}{4.08 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 2.27 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

This shows that the paramagnetic coupling term is approximately \( 2.27 \times 10^{-5} \) times the transition energy, meaning it is much smaller.

### Conclusion
The paramagnetic coupling term is much less than the transition energy. Therefore, the correct option is:

**C) \( \langle H \rangle \ll \Delta E \).**
