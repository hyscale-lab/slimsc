Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit unsure where to start, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's going on.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Then, it's combined with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature, forming product 1.

Next, product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid to form product 2. Then, product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO, making product 3. Finally, product 3 is heated at 150Â°C to form the final product 4. The question is asking how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are there on product 4.

The options are A) 8, B)4, C)10, D)7. Hmm, okay.

First, I think I need to figure out what each reaction step does. Let me start by visualizing the structures.

Starting compound: 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is a norbornane structure. The substituent is a tert-butoxy group at position 7. So, the norbornene structure has a substituent which is O-t-Bu (tert-butoxy) attached.

Reaction 1: This is combined with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide. Hmm. Sodium iodide is a good nucleophile in SN2 reactions, and dibromomethyl groups are leaving groups. Wait, but the starting material has two dibromomethyl groups on a cyclohexadiene.

Wait, perhaps this is a Diels-Alder reaction? Because the starting material is a bicyclic diene, and the other reactant is a dienophile. Wait, but the other compound is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. Wait, that's a cyclohexene with substituents. Let me think. The cyclohexa-1,3-diene would have two double bonds? Or perhaps it's a conjugated diene? Wait, cyclohexa-1,3-diene is a conjugated diene, but it's substituted with two dibromomethyl groups at positions 5 and 6.

Alternatively, maybe this is a diene and a dienophile. Wait, wait. The starting molecule is a bicyclo system with two double bonds (hepta-2,5-diene), making it a conjugated diene. The other molecule is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So, cyclohexa-1,3-diene is a conjugated diene as well. But that's a diene; perhaps it's a dienophile in a Diels-Alder reaction?

Wait, but the reaction is with sodium iodide. Oh, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution. Alternatively, perhaps the dibromomethyl groups act as leaving groups. So, maybe it's a coupling reaction.

Wait, another thought: The starting compound is a bicyclic diene (norbornadiene). The other compound is a cyclohexadiene with two dibromomethyl groups. Maybe this is a Diels-Alder reaction where the norbornadiene is the diene, and the cyclohexadiene is the dienophile. But wait, the Diels-Alder usually requires a conjugated diene and a dienophile with a electron-deficient double bond. But in this case, the cyclohexadiene has two dibromomethyl groups, which are probably electron-withdrawing due to the leaving groups.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening or a substitution. Wait, when sodium iodide is present with dibromomethyl groups, maybe it's an SN2 reaction. Di bromo groups are good leaving groups (as Br-), but perhaps the iodide acts as a nucleophile. But in this case, the starting compound is a bicyclo diene, so maybe it's acting as a diene in a Diels-Alder with the cyclohexadiene as dienophile.

Wait, but the cyclohexa-1,3-diene with two dibromomethyl groups would have substituents on positions 5 and 6. So, if the starting compound is the diene, and the other is the dienophile, perhaps the bicyclo diene is the diene, and the cyclohexadiene is the dienophile.

Wait, in Diels-Alder, the diene is conjugated and the dienophile is something like a double bond that's electron-deficient. Dibromomethyl groups are electron-withdrawing, perhaps activating the dienophile.

So, perhaps the reaction is a Diels-Alder between norbornadiene (the diene) and 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene (the dienophile), giving a bridged bicyclic structure. Since two equivalents are used, maybe two Diels-Alder reactions occur.

Wait, no. Wait, the starting material is a bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, which is a norbornene-like structure. So, it's a fused bicyclic compound with two double bonds. So, perhaps each of the two double bonds can react in a Diels-Alder reaction with two equivalents of the cyclohexadiene.

Wait, but the cyclohexadiene is a dienophile, so each norbornadiene's double bond would react with a dienophile. Alternatively, maybe the norbornadiene is a diene, and the cyclohexa-1,3-diene is a dienophile, so each equivalent of dienophile would add across a double bond of the norbornadiene.

Wait, but norbornadiene has two double bonds, so perhaps two equivalents of the dienophile would add to each double bond, but that would require two dienophiles. So, with two equivalents, that's possible.

Wait, but Diels-Alder forms six-membered transition states, so perhaps each double bond in the norbornadiene would react once, leading to a bridged product.

Alternatively, perhaps each dienophile molecule adds across a single double bond of the norbornadiene. So, if you have two dienophiles and two double bonds in the starting material, you might get two Diels-Alder adducts.

But wait, the starting compound is a bicyclo with two conjugated double bonds? Or perhaps it's a bicyclo with two isolated double bonds. Wait, bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. So, the structure is a norbornene system with double bonds at 2 and 5. So, positions 2-3 and 5-6 (assuming numbering), but I'm not exactly sure about the numbering, but the point is, it's a conjugated diene within a bicyclic structure.

So, the Diels-Alder reaction would form a six-membered transition state. Let me think about the product. Each dienophile (5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexadiene) would add to the diene in the norbornene structure, leading to a bridged bicyclic compound.

Wait, but the dienophile has two dibromomethyl groups. So, when the Diels-Alder occurs, the two substituents (dibromomethyl) would be attached to the cyclohexene part as substituents.

Wait, maybe the Diels-Alder would connect the diene (norbornene) with the dienophile (cyclohexadiene), forming a new six-membered ring. So, the product after Diels-Alder would have the norbornene fused to another ring, perhaps.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about what each step does, starting from the first reaction.

First step: Diels-Alder between the norbornadiene and the dienophile (5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexadiene). Since two equivalents are used, perhaps two Diels-Alder reactions occur, each adding a dienophile across each double bond. But wait, the starting norbornadiene has two double bonds, so each could react once.

Wait, but the starting norbornadiene is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. So, perhaps it's a conjugated diene with two double bonds. So, the Diels-Alder would add two dienophiles, each across each double bond.

Wait, but that's not typical. Diels-Alder is usually a single reaction per diene. Unless the diene is in a position that allows for two separate Diels-Alder reactions. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is a substitution.

Wait, sodium iodide and dibromomethyl groups. Maybe it's a substitution reaction where iodide displaces bromide. So, the dienophile has two bromomethyl groups. So, the iodide could displace the bromide, leading to a CH2-I group.

Wait, no, because the dienophile has two dibromomethyl groups, meaning each substituent is CH2Br. So, in the presence of NaI, which has I-, perhaps the bromides would be replaced by iodides. So, each CH2Br would become CH2I. But wait, why would that happen? Because I- is a better nucleophile than Br-? Or perhaps the NaI is just a source of iodide.

Wait, but that's probably not the main reaction. Alternatively, the dibromomethyl groups might act as leaving groups in an elimination reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile is something else. Wait, when you have a dienophile with leaving groups, perhaps the reaction is a 1,4-addition. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cycloaddition where the dienophile is activated.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is more about the substitution of the bromides with something else. Wait, but the product 1 is formed after combining these, so perhaps we're getting a cross coupling or a substitution.

Wait, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution where the norbornadiene acts as a nucleophile, attacking the dienophile where the bromides are good leaving groups. So, perhaps each dienophile can undergo two SN2 reactions, each replacing a Br with a group from the norbornadiene.

But that seems a bit unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the norbornadiene is a diene and the dienophile is the cyclohexadiene with Br groups, and the Diels-Alder forms a new ring.

Wait, perhaps the dienophile is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So, the cyclohexadiene has two substituents at positions 5 and 6, each being CH2Br. Hmm.

Wait, in a Diels-Alder reaction, the dienophile would typically be an electron-deficient diene, but in this case, the dienophile is a cyclohexadiene with two electron-withdrawing groups (Br in CH2Br), making the dienophile more reactive.

So, when the Diels-Alder occurs, the dienophile would react with the diene (norbornadiene) to form a six-membered ring adduct. Since the starting dienophile has two Br groups, perhaps those Br groups would end up in the adduct.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should look up the structure of bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. It's a norbornene structure, which is a bicyclic compound with two double bonds. So, in the Diels-Alder reaction, each double bond could react with a dienophile.

Wait, but I only have two equivalents of dienophile, and two double bonds, so perhaps both double bonds in the norbornene react, each with a dienophile.

So, product 1 would have two new rings added via Diels-Alder, each from the dienophile. Let me try to imagine that.

So after the first step, product 1 would have two new substituents from the dienophiles attached. Then, product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid to form product 2.

Looking at the next step: treatment with aqueous H2SO4. That suggests an acid-catalyzed reaction. Maybe a ring-opening or a dehydration. Alternatively, it could be a sulfonation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the adducts from Diels-Alder undergo some acid-catalyzed reaction, like a retro-Diels-Alder? Not sure.

Wait, another thought: the Diels-Alder product would have exo or endo substituents. Upon acid treatment, maybe some groups are removed or rings are opened. Alternatively, perhaps the dibromomethyl groups are hydrolyzed. Wait, but in the presence of aqueous H2SO4, maybe the dihalomethyl groups (CH2Br) are replaced. But wait, the dienophiles had CH2Br groups; maybe after Diels-Alder, the adduct has CH2Br groups attached.

Wait, perhaps the first reaction is a Diels-Alder forming a six-membered ring with two CH2Br groups attached. Then, treatment with H2SO4 (aqueous) could cause the CH2Br groups to undergo some reaction, perhaps hydrolysis.

Wait, CH2Br in an acidic aqueous solution would undergo hydrolysis. But wait, CH2Br in such conditions would typically form CH2OH and HBr, but HBr is a strong acid and would protonate. But wait, more accurately, in the presence of water and acid, the CH2Br group would hydrolyze to CH2OH. So, the Br would be replaced by OH.

Wait, but wait, in the presence of H2SO4, perhaps the bromide would be protonated, making it a better leaving group, and then water would attack, leading to substitution. So, each CH2Br would become CH2OH.

So, product 1 would have two CH2Br groups, which upon treatment with H2SO4 and water, become CH2OH groups. So, product 2 would have two CH2OH substituents.

Then, product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO to form product 3. SO3 is a sulfonating agent. Pyridine is often used as a base in such reactions, and DMSO is a polar aprotic solvent.

SO3 is typically used for sulfonation, where a hydrogen on an aromatic ring is replaced by a sulfonic acid group. But wait, if product 2 has hydroxyl groups, perhaps the SO3 would sulfonate them. Alternatively, perhaps the hydroxyl groups are converted into leaving groups.

Wait, if product 2 has CH2OH groups, then treatment with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO might lead to a sulfonation of the hydroxyl groups. Let me think: SO3 is a good electrophile. In the presence of a hydroxyl group, the -OH could be protonated, making it a better leaving group. Then, SO3 would attack the oxygen, displacing the OH and forming a sulfate ester? Or perhaps converting the OH into a sulfonic acid group.

Wait, but wait, when you have a secondary or tertiary alcohol, sulfonation can occur if the leaving group is good enough. In this case, the CH2OH groups are primary alcohols, so perhaps they can be sulfonated.

So, the reaction would convert the -CH2OH groups into -CH2OSO3H groups. So, product 3 would have two CH2OSO3H substituents.

Then, product 3 is heated at 150Â°C to form product 4. Heating with such conditions might lead to elimination reactions or ring-forming reactions.

Wait, if product 3 has CH2OSO3H groups, heating could cause the sulfonic acid groups to leave, leading to the formation of double bonds. Because the sulfonic acid group is a good leaving group. So, perhaps each CH2OSO3H group would lose H2O and the sulfate group, forming a double bond.

Wait, each CH2OSO3H would lose H2O and the sulfate, leading to a CH2 group turning into a double bond. So, for each CH2OSO3H, upon heating, you might get an elimination reaction, forming a double bond.

But wait, elimination would require adjacent H atoms. So, if a CH2 group is adjacent to a leaving group, you could lose H from adjacent carbons to form a double bond. So, perhaps each CH2OSO3H group, when heated, would lose the sulfate and a hydrogen from the adjacent carbon, forming a double bond.

Wait, but if each CH2OSO3H is on a carbon adjacent to another CH2, maybe you can form a double bond between them, leading to a longer conjugated system.

Wait, let's think about the structure after Diels-Alder. Suppose the Diels-Alder product has two CH2Br groups attached to the ring. After treatment with H2SO4, they become CH2OH. Then, treatment with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO would convert them into CH2OSO3H. Heating would then cause elimination, perhaps forming a double bond between those carbons.

So, if each CH2OSO3H is on adjacent carbons, the elimination would form a double bond between those two carbons, leading to a conjugated diene.

Wait, but maybe each CH2OSO3H is on a carbon that's part of a ring, so elimination would form a double bond within the ring, possibly making the ring more strained or less, depending on the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a larger ring or a fused ring structure.

But I'm a bit stuck on the exact structure. Let me try to think about the possible products and their hydrogen environments.

After all the steps, the final product 4 would have some structure where certain groups have been eliminated, leading to double bonds or rings that might have equivalent or nonequivalent hydrogens.

The question is about the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms. So, I need to figure out the symmetry in the molecule and how many unique H environments there are.

Let me try to outline the steps again briefly:

1. Diels-Alder reaction between norbornadiene and two equivalents of dienophile to form product 1. Each Diels-Alder adduct adds a dienophile, so product 1 has two CH2Br groups added.

2. Treatment with H2SO4 converts CH2Br to CH2OH.

3. Sulfonation with SO3 converts CH2OH to CH2OSO3H.

4. Heating eliminates to form double bonds, likely creating new rings or conjugated systems.

Wait a second, perhaps instead of elimination, the sulfonate groups are leaving, leading to the formation of rings.

Wait, when you have two adjacent CH2OSO3H groups, heating could cause each to lose the sulfate group and a hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. So, each CH2OSO3H would lose H2O and the sulfate, leading to a double bond between the two CH2 groups.

Wait, but if the two CH2OSO3H groups are on adjacent carbons, the elimination would form a double bond between those two, converting two single bonds into one double bond and releasing two molecules of H2O and two sulfate ions.

So, in product 4, perhaps two new double bonds are formed, leading to a more conjugated or ring-strained structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination forms a bridge or a new ring, which would affect the symmetry of the molecule.

Wait, considering the initial structure, after two Diels-Alder reactions, product 1 would have two rings added to the norbornene. Then, each of these adducts would have CH2Br substituents. Then, after H2SO4 treatment, they become CH2OH. Then, SO3 and pyridine in DMSO sulfonate them to CH2OSO3H. Heating would eliminate these groups, possibly forming new double bonds.

If each elimination forms a double bond, the molecule would have more rings or new conjugated double bonds, which can affect the number of distinct hydrogen environments.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the symmetry in the final product. The starting material has the tert-butoxy group, which is a bulky substituent. After the reactions, perhaps the molecule becomes more symmetrical or less, depending on where the substituents end up.

Wait, perhaps the product 4 is a more symmetric structure, leading to fewer unique H environments. Or maybe it's less symmetric.

Alternatively, let me think about each step's effect on the molecule.

1. Diels-Alder adds two rings, each with two CH2Br substituents. But perhaps each Diels-Alder adds a dienophile across each double bond, leading to two new rings.

2. Treatment with H2SO4 converts the CH2Br to CH2OH, making each substituent -CH2OH.

3. Sulfonation converts each -CH2OH to -CH2OSO3H.

4. Heating at 150Â°C leads to elimination of the sulfonate groups, forming double bonds.

So, the final product would have two new double bonds where the CH2OSO3H groups were, perhaps leading to a more rigid structure.

Now, considering the number of distinct H atoms, I need to figure out how symmetric the final structure is. For example, if there are multiple equivalent positions due to symmetry, that would reduce the number of distinct Hs.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a highly symmetric molecule with several equivalent Hs.

But without the exact structure, this is challenging. Let me think about the possible options.

The options are 8,4,10,7. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the final product is a cubane or some highly symmetric structure, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a norbornene, and after the reactions, it becomes something like adamantane, which has a lot of symmetry.

Wait, adamantane has four equivalent axial hydrogens and four equivalent equatorial hydrogens, making 8 distinct hydrogens. Wait, no, adamantane has more than that. Let me think: the structure of adamantane is a diamondoid structure with multiple rings. Each carbon in adamantane is either part of three or four-membered rings.

Wait, in adamantane, each carbon is either a CH2 group or part of a bridge. The hydrogens on adamantane are in different environments. Let me recall: adamantane has 10 hydrogens in total, but they're in different environments. Or wait, perhaps I'm mixing it up with other structures.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach.

If the final product is adamantane, which has 10 hydrogen atoms, but how many are chemically distinct?

Wait, adamantane has a structure like a diamond fragment. Each of the bridgehead carbons has two CH groups, and the others are CH2. Wait, but wait, adamantane's structure is such that there are no equivalent hydrogens. Each hydrogen is in a unique environment.

Wait, no, adamantane's hydrogen atoms are all equivalent in certain positions. Let me think: adamantane has four methyl-like groups, but arranged in a way that all the hydrogens are equivalent. No, actually, adamantane's structure is more complex. It has 10 hydrogen atoms, each in a different environment. So, the number of distinct Hs would be 10.

Wait, no, wait. Let me check. Adamantane has four bridgehead carbons, each connected to two other bridgeheads. The structure is such that each bridgehead has two CH groups, and the other carbons are CH2. But wait, the bridgehead CH groups are all equivalent because of the symmetry. So, each bridgehead CH has two equivalent Hs, making two distinct types: bridgehead Hs and CH2 Hs.

Wait, no. Actually, in adamantane, there are two types of hydrogen: the bridgehead hydrogens and the others. The bridgehead hydrogens are all equivalent, and the CH2 hydrogens are all equivalent as well. So, two distinct types of H. But that would mean total of two, which is not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Alternatively, if the final product is norbornene-based but with some substituents that create symmetry, leading to specific H environments.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a structure with more symmetry, leading to fewer distinct Hs.

Wait, going back, perhaps the final product has three distinct types of Hs. Let's say, for example, some Hs are on a bridge, some are on a ring, etc.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's challenging. Maybe I should think about the possible answers. The options are 4,7,8,10. If the molecule has a lot of symmetry, perhaps the number is lower, like 4 or 8. If the structure is more complex and asymmetric, the number could be higher, like 10.

Wait, considering the starting material has a tert-butoxy group, which is a bulky substituent, perhaps the final product has a structure where this group remains, contributing to some unique Hs.

Wait, perhaps the final product has 8 distinct Hs. So, the answer is A)8.

Alternatively, maybe after elimination, the product has a more symmetric structure, leading to fewer distinct Hs.

Hmm. Alternatively, in the initial structure, the tert-butoxy group is at position 7, which is part of the bicyclo system. After all the reactions, perhaps this group remains, but the rest of the structure becomes more symmetric.

Wait, another approach: count the number of H environments in each step.

Let me think about the starting material: 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene.

The bicyclo has 7 carbons. The substituent is tert-butoxy at position 7. The structure has two double bonds. So, the molecule might have several H environments.

After the Diels-Alder, product 1 is a more complex structure with two additional rings, each with CH2Br substituents. Then, after treatment with H2SO4, these become CH2OH. Then, sulfonation converts them to CH2OSO3H. Heating forms double bonds, leading to a more rigid structure.

Assuming that in the final product, the elimination leads to the formation of two new double bonds, perhaps creating a more symmetric structure.

Wait, perhaps the final product is a norbornene derivative with two new double bonds, making it a more rigid structure with several equivalent Hs.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a cubane structure, which has 8 equivalent Hs. But cubane has eight Hs, all equivalent. So, the number would be 1.

Wait, but 8 is one of the options. Hmm.

Alternatively, the final product might have some symmetry, leading to 8 distinct Hs.

But without knowing the exact structure, I'm really just guessing.

Wait, maybe I should think about the process again.

After the Diels-Alder, the product has two CH2Br groups. After H2SO4, they become CH2OH. Sulfonation leads to CH2OSO3H. Heating eliminates these groups, forming double bonds.

So, if each CH2OSO3H is on a carbon adjacent to another CH2OSO3H, elimination would form a double bond between them, creating a conjugated diene.

So, perhaps the final product has two new double bonds, leading to a structure with more rings.

Wait, if the starting norbornadiene has two double bonds, and after Diels-Alder, two more rings are added, perhaps the final product after elimination would have a structure similar to a cubane or adamantane.

Assuming the final product has a structure with a high degree of symmetry, perhaps with multiple equivalent Hs.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a tricyclic compound where certain Hs are equivalent.

But I'm not making progress here. Let me think about the possible answer options again.

If the correct answer is 7 (option D), perhaps the structure has seven unique Hs. Alternatively, option B is 4, which would imply a lot of symmetry.

But I'm not certain. Another approach: perhaps the final product after all reactions is adamantane. Adamantane has 10 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms, but in a very symmetric structure. But I'm not sure.

Wait, no, adamantane has 10 carbons and 18 hydrogens, but the number of chemically distinct hydrogens is more than one. Wait, no, each H in adamantane is in a unique environment. So, the number of distinct Hs would be 10, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure after elimination leads to a structure with 10 distinct Hs. So, the answer would be C)10.

Wait, but I'm actually not confident. Another thought: perhaps the final product has 8 H environments. So, the answer is A)8.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a molecule with a structure that has 7 distinct Hs. So, the answer is D)7.

I think I'm stuck, but based on the prior steps, the elimination leads to a more symmetric structure, perhaps with fewer distinct Hs. Maybe the answer is 8, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about possible elimination. Each CH2OSO3H group is on adjacent carbons, so elimination would form a double bond between them. So, each elimination would create a new double bond.

If there are two such eliminations, perhaps two new double bonds are formed, making the molecule more rigid and with more symmetry.

In such a structure, perhaps the molecule has a certain symmetry, leading to a specific number of H environments.

But without the exact structure, it's hard to say. Maybe the correct answer is 7.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 8. I'm going to take a guess that the correct answer is A)8.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. The first step is a reaction with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide, likely forming a Diels-Alder adduct. The norbornadiene acts as the diene, and the cyclohexadiene with dibromomethyl groups serves as the dienophile. This results in two Diels-Alder reactions, as there are two double bonds in the norbornadiene and two equivalents of dienophile are used. The product (product 1) likely has two CH2Br substituents added.

In the second step, treatment with aqueous sulfuric acid converts the CH2Br groups into CH2OH groups via hydrolysis. 

In the third step, treatment with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO sulfonates the CH2OH groups, converting them into CH2OSO3H groups.

In the final step, heating at 150Â°C leads to elimination of the sulfonate groups, forming double bonds. This elimination likely results in a more rigid and conjugated structure, potentially with increased symmetry.

The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product (product 4). The analysis considers the symmetry of the final structure and the elimination process. While the exact structure is unclear, the elimination step likely forms a rigid, conjugated system with some symmetry. Based on the reasoning, the final product is hypothesized to have 8 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.

Answer: A

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit unsure where to start, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's going on.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Then, it's combined with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature, forming product 1.

Next, product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid to form product 2. Then, product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO, making product 3. Finally, product 3 is heated at 150Â°C to form the final product 4. The question is asking how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are there on product 4.

The options are A) 8, B)4, C)10, D)7. Hmm, okay.

First, I think I need to figure out what each reaction step does. Let me start by visualizing the structures.

Starting compound: 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is a norbornane structure. The substituent is a tert-butoxy group at position 7. So, the norbornene structure has a substituent which is O-t-Bu (tert-butoxy) attached.

Reaction 1: This is combined with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide. Hmm. Sodium iodide is a good nucleophile in SN2 reactions, and dibromomethyl groups are leaving groups. Wait, but the starting material has two dibromomethyl groups on a cyclohexadiene.

Wait, perhaps this is a Diels-Alder reaction? Because the starting material is a bicyclic diene, and the other reactant is a dienophile. Wait, but the other compound is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. Wait, that's a cyclohexene with substituents. Let me think. The cyclohexa-1,3-diene would have two double bonds? Or perhaps it's a conjugated diene? Wait, cyclohexa-1,3-diene is a conjugated diene, but it's substituted with two dibromomethyl groups at positions 5 and 6.

Alternatively, maybe this is a diene and a dienophile. Wait, wait. The starting molecule is a bicyclo system with two double bonds (hepta-2,5-diene), making it a conjugated diene. The other molecule is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So, cyclohexa-1,3-diene is a conjugated diene as well. But that's a diene; perhaps it's a dienophile in a Diels-Alder reaction?

Wait, but the reaction is with sodium iodide. Oh, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution. Alternatively, perhaps the dibromomethyl groups act as leaving groups. So, maybe it's a coupling reaction.

Wait, another thought: The starting compound is a bicyclic diene (norbornadiene). The other compound is a cyclohexadiene with two dibromomethyl groups. Maybe this is a Diels-Alder reaction where the norbornadiene is the diene, and the cyclohexadiene is the dienophile. But wait, the Diels-Alder usually requires a conjugated diene and a dienophile with a electron-deficient double bond. But in this case, the cyclohexadiene has two dibromomethyl groups, which are probably electron-withdrawing due to the leaving groups.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening or a substitution. Wait, when sodium iodide is present with dibromomethyl groups, maybe it's an SN2 reaction. Di bromo groups are good leaving groups (as Br-), but perhaps the iodide acts as a nucleophile. But in this case, the starting compound is a bicyclo diene, so maybe it's acting as a diene in a Diels-Alder with the cyclohexadiene as dienophile.

Wait, but the cyclohexa-1,3-diene with two dibromomethyl groups would have substituents on positions 5 and 6. So, if the starting compound is the diene, and the other is the dienophile, perhaps the bicyclo diene is the diene, and the cyclohexadiene is the dienophile.

Wait, in Diels-Alder, the diene is conjugated and the dienophile is something like a double bond that's electron-deficient. Dibromomethyl groups are electron-withdrawing, perhaps activating the dienophile.

So, perhaps the reaction is a Diels-Alder between norbornadiene (the diene) and 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene (the dienophile), giving a bridged bicyclic structure. Since two equivalents are used, maybe two Diels-Alder reactions occur.

Wait, no. Wait, the starting material is a bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, which is a norbornene-like structure. So, it's a fused bicyclic compound with two double bonds. So, perhaps each of the two double bonds can react in a Diels-Alder reaction with two equivalents of the cyclohexadiene.

Wait, but the cyclohexadiene is a dienophile, so each norbornadiene's double bond would react with a dienophile. Alternatively, maybe the norbornadiene is a diene, and the cyclohexa-1,3-diene is a dienophile, so each equivalent of dienophile would add across a double bond of the norbornadiene.

Wait, but norbornadiene has two double bonds, so perhaps two equivalents of the dienophile would add to each double bond, but that would require two dienophiles. So, with two equivalents, that's possible.

Wait, but Diels-Alder forms six-membered transition states, so perhaps each double bond in the norbornadiene would react once, leading to a bridged product.

Alternatively, perhaps each dienophile molecule adds across a single double bond of the norbornadiene. So, if you have two dienophiles and two double bonds in the starting material, you might get two Diels-Alder adducts.

But wait, the starting compound is a bicyclo with two conjugated double bonds? Or perhaps it's a bicyclo with two isolated double bonds. Wait, bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. So, the structure is a norbornene system with double bonds at 2 and 5. So, positions 2-3 and 5-6 (assuming numbering), but I'm not exactly sure about the numbering, but the point is, it's a conjugated diene within a bicyclic structure.

So, the Diels-Alder reaction would form a six-membered transition state. Let me think about the product. Each dienophile (5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexadiene) would add to the diene in the norbornene structure, leading to a bridged bicyclic compound.

Wait, but the dienophile has two dibromomethyl groups. So, when the Diels-Alder occurs, the two substituents (dibromomethyl) would be attached to the cyclohexene part as substituents.

Wait, maybe the Diels-Alder would connect the diene (norbornene) with the dienophile (cyclohexadiene), forming a new six-membered ring. So, the product after Diels-Alder would have the norbornene fused to another ring, perhaps.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about what each step does, starting from the first reaction.

First step: Diels-Alder between the norbornadiene and the dienophile (5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexadiene). Since two equivalents are used, perhaps two Diels-Alder reactions occur, each adding a dienophile across each double bond. But wait, the starting norbornadiene has two double bonds, so each could react once.

Wait, but the starting norbornadiene is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. So, perhaps it's a conjugated diene with two double bonds. So, the Diels-Alder would add two dienophiles, each across each double bond.

Wait, but that's not typical. Diels-Alder is usually a single reaction per diene. Unless the diene is in a position that allows for two separate Diels-Alder reactions. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is a substitution.

Wait, sodium iodide and dibromomethyl groups. Maybe it's a substitution reaction where iodide displaces bromide. So, the dienophile has two bromomethyl groups. So, the iodide could displace the bromide, leading to a CH2-I group.

Wait, no, because the dienophile has two dibromomethyl groups, meaning each substituent is CH2Br. So, in the presence of NaI, which has I-, perhaps the bromides would be replaced by iodides. So, each CH2Br would become CH2I. But wait, why would that happen? Because I- is a better nucleophile than Br-? Or perhaps the NaI is just a source of iodide.

Wait, but that's probably not the main reaction. Alternatively, the dibromomethyl groups might act as leaving groups in an elimination reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile is something else. Wait, when you have a dienophile with leaving groups, perhaps the reaction is a 1,4-addition. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cycloaddition where the dienophile is activated.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is more about the substitution of the bromides with something else. Wait, but the product 1 is formed after combining these, so perhaps we're getting a cross coupling or a substitution.

Wait, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution where the norbornadiene acts as a nucleophile, attacking the dienophile where the bromides are good leaving groups. So, perhaps each dienophile can undergo two SN2 reactions, each replacing a Br with a group from the norbornadiene.

But that seems a bit unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the norbornadiene is a diene and the dienophile is the cyclohexadiene with Br groups, and the Diels-Alder forms a new ring.

Wait, perhaps the dienophile is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So, the cyclohexadiene has two substituents at positions 5 and 6, each being CH2Br. Hmm.

Wait, in a Diels-Alder reaction, the dienophile would typically be an electron-deficient diene, but in this case, the dienophile is a cyclohexadiene with two electron-withdrawing groups (Br in CH2Br), making the dienophile more reactive.

So, when the Diels-Alder occurs, the dienophile would react with the diene (norbornadiene) to form a six-membered ring adduct. Since the starting dienophile has two Br groups, perhaps those Br groups would end up in the adduct.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should look up the structure of bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. It's a norbornene structure, which is a bicyclic compound with two double bonds. So, in the Diels-Alder reaction, each double bond could react with a dienophile.

Wait, but I only have two equivalents of dienophile, and two double bonds, so perhaps both double bonds in the norbornene react, each with a dienophile.

So, product 1 would have two new rings added via Diels-Alder, each from the dienophile. Let me try to imagine that.

So after the first step, product 1 would have two new substituents from the dienophiles attached. Then, product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid to form product 2.

Looking at the next step: treatment with aqueous H2SO4. That suggests an acid-catalyzed reaction. Maybe a ring-opening or a dehydration. Alternatively, it could be a sulfonation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the adducts from Diels-Alder undergo some acid-catalyzed reaction, like a retro-Diels-Alder? Not sure.

Wait, another thought: the Diels-Alder product would have exo or endo substituents. Upon acid treatment, maybe some groups are removed or rings are opened. Alternatively, perhaps the dibromomethyl groups are hydrolyzed. Wait, but in the presence of aqueous H2SO4, maybe the dihalomethyl groups (CH2Br) are replaced. But wait, the dienophiles had CH2Br groups; maybe after Diels-Alder, the adduct has CH2Br groups attached.

Wait, perhaps the first reaction is a Diels-Alder forming a six-membered ring with two CH2Br groups attached. Then, treatment with H2SO4 (aqueous) could cause the CH2Br groups to undergo some reaction, perhaps hydrolysis.

Wait, CH2Br in an acidic aqueous solution would undergo hydrolysis. But wait, CH2Br in such conditions would typically form CH2OH and HBr, but HBr is a strong acid and would protonate. But wait, more accurately, in the presence of water and acid, the CH2Br group would hydrolyze to CH2OH. So, the Br would be replaced by OH.

Wait, but wait, in the presence of H2SO4, perhaps the bromide would be protonated, making it a better leaving group, and then water would attack, leading to substitution. So, each CH2Br would become CH2OH.

So, product 1 would have two CH2Br groups, which upon treatment with H2SO4 and water, become CH2OH groups. So, product 2 would have two CH2OH substituents.

Then, product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO to form product 3. SO3 is a sulfonating agent. Pyridine is often used as a base in such reactions, and DMSO is a polar aprotic solvent.

SO3 is typically used for sulfonation, where a hydrogen on an aromatic ring is replaced by a sulfonic acid group. But wait, if product 2 has hydroxyl groups, perhaps the SO3 would sulfonate them. Alternatively, perhaps the hydroxyl groups are converted into leaving groups.

Wait, if product 2 has CH2OH groups, then treatment with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO might lead to a sulfonation of the hydroxyl groups. Let me think: SO3 is a good electrophile. In the presence of a hydroxyl group, the -OH could be protonated, making it a better leaving group. Then, SO3 would attack the oxygen, displacing the OH and forming a sulfate ester? Or perhaps converting the OH into a sulfonic acid group.

Wait, but wait, when you have a secondary or tertiary alcohol, sulfonation can occur if the leaving group is good enough. In this case, the CH2OH groups are primary alcohols, so perhaps they can be sulfonated.

So, the reaction would convert the -CH2OH groups into -CH2OSO3H groups. So, product 3 would have two CH2OSO3H substituents.

Then, product 3 is heated at 150Â°C to form product 4. Heating with such conditions might lead to elimination reactions or ring-forming reactions.

Wait, if product 3 has CH2OSO3H groups, heating could cause the sulfonic acid groups to leave, leading to the formation of double bonds. Because the sulfonic acid group is a good leaving group. So, perhaps each CH2OSO3H group would lose H2O and the sulfate group, forming a double bond.

Wait, each CH2OSO3H would lose H2O and the sulfate, leading to a CH2 group turning into a double bond. So, for each CH2OSO3H, upon heating, you might get an elimination reaction, forming a double bond.

But wait, elimination would require adjacent H atoms. So, if a CH2 group is adjacent to a leaving group, you could lose H from adjacent carbons to form a double bond. So, perhaps each CH2OSO3H group, when heated, would lose the sulfate and a hydrogen from the adjacent carbon, forming a double bond.

Wait, but if each CH2OSO3H is on a carbon adjacent to another CH2, maybe you can form a double bond between them, leading to a longer conjugated system.

Wait, let's think about the structure after Diels-Alder. Suppose the Diels-Alder product has two CH2Br groups attached to the ring. After treatment with H2SO4, they become CH2OH. Then, treatment with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO would convert them into CH2OSO3H. Heating would then cause elimination, perhaps forming a double bond between those carbons.

So, if each CH2OSO3H is on adjacent carbons, the elimination would form a double bond between those two carbons, leading to a conjugated diene.

Wait, but maybe each CH2OSO3H is on a carbon that's part of a ring, so elimination would form a double bond within the ring, possibly making the ring more strained or less, depending on the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a larger ring or a fused ring structure.

But I'm a bit stuck on the exact structure. Let me try to think about the possible products and their hydrogen environments.

After all the steps, the final product 4 would have some structure where certain groups have been eliminated, leading to double bonds or rings that might have equivalent or nonequivalent hydrogens.

The question is about the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms. So, I need to figure out the symmetry in the molecule and how many unique H environments there are.

Let me try to outline the steps again briefly:

1. Diels-Alder reaction between norbornadiene and two equivalents of dienophile to form product 1. Each Diels-Alder adduct adds a dienophile, so product 1 has two CH2Br groups added.

2. Treatment with H2SO4 converts CH2Br to CH2OH.

3. Sulfonation with SO3 converts CH2OH to CH2OSO3H.

4. Heating eliminates to form double bonds, likely creating new rings or conjugated systems.

Wait a second, perhaps instead of elimination, the sulfonate groups are leaving, leading to the formation of rings.

Wait, when you have two adjacent CH2OSO3H groups, heating could cause each to lose the sulfate group and a hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. So, each CH2OSO3H would lose H2O and the sulfate, leading to a double bond between the two CH2 groups.

Wait, but if the two CH2OSO3H groups are on adjacent carbons, the elimination would form a double bond between those two, converting two single bonds into one double bond and releasing two molecules of H2O and two sulfate ions.

So, in product 4, perhaps two new double bonds are formed, leading to a more conjugated or ring-strained structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination forms a bridge or a new ring, which would affect the symmetry of the molecule.

Wait, considering the initial structure, after two Diels-Alder reactions, product 1 would have two rings added to the norbornene. Then, each of these adducts would have CH2Br substituents. Then, after H2SO4 treatment, they become CH2OH. Then, SO3 and pyridine in DMSO sulfonate them to CH2OSO3H. Heating would eliminate these groups, possibly forming new double bonds.

If each elimination forms a double bond, the molecule would have more rings or new conjugated double bonds, which can affect the number of distinct hydrogen environments.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the symmetry in the final product. The starting material has the tert-butoxy group, which is a bulky substituent. After the reactions, perhaps the molecule becomes more symmetrical or less, depending on where the substituents end up.

Wait, perhaps the product 4 is a more symmetric structure, leading to fewer unique H environments. Or maybe it's less symmetric.

Alternatively, let me think about each step's effect on the molecule.

1. Diels-Alder adds two rings, each with two CH2Br substituents. But perhaps each Diels-Alder adds a dienophile across each double bond, leading to two new rings.

2. Treatment with H2SO4 converts the CH2Br to CH2OH, making each substituent -CH2OH.

3. Sulfonation converts each -CH2OH to -CH2OSO3H.

4. Heating at 150Â°C leads to elimination of the sulfonate groups, forming double bonds.

So, the final product would have two new double bonds where the CH2OSO3H groups were, perhaps leading to a more rigid structure.

Now, considering the number of distinct H atoms, I need to figure out how symmetric the final structure is. For example, if there are multiple equivalent positions due to symmetry, that would reduce the number of distinct Hs.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a highly symmetric molecule with several equivalent Hs.

But without the exact structure, this is challenging. Let me think about the possible options.

The options are 8,4,10,7. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the final product is a cubane or some highly symmetric structure, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a norbornene, and after the reactions, it becomes something like adamantane, which has a lot of symmetry.

Wait, adamantane has four equivalent axial hydrogens and four equivalent equatorial hydrogens, making 8 distinct hydrogens. Wait, no, adamantane has more than that. Let me think: the structure of adamantane is a diamondoid structure with multiple rings. Each carbon in adamantane is either part of three or four-membered rings.

Wait, in adamantane, each carbon is either a CH2 group or part of a bridge. The hydrogens on adamantane are in different environments. Let me recall: adamantane has 10 hydrogens in total, but they're in different environments. Or wait, perhaps I'm mixing it up with other structures.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach.

If the final product is adamantane, which has 10 hydrogen atoms, but how many are chemically distinct?

Wait, adamantane has a structure like a diamond fragment. Each of the bridgehead carbons has two CH groups, and the others are CH2. Wait, but wait, adamantane's structure is such that there are no equivalent hydrogens. Each hydrogen is in a unique environment.

Wait, no, adamantane's hydrogen atoms are all equivalent in certain positions. Let me think: adamantane has four methyl-like groups, but arranged in a way that all the hydrogens are equivalent. No, actually, adamantane's structure is more complex. It has 10 hydrogen atoms, each in a different environment. So, the number of distinct Hs would be 10.

Wait, no, wait. Let me check. Adamantane has four bridgehead carbons, each connected to two other bridgeheads. The structure is such that each bridgehead has two CH groups, and the other carbons are CH2. But wait, the bridgehead CH groups are all equivalent because of the symmetry. So, each bridgehead CH has two equivalent Hs, making two distinct types: bridgehead Hs and CH2 Hs.

Wait, no. Actually, in adamantane, there are two types of hydrogen: the bridgehead hydrogens and the others. The bridgehead hydrogens are all equivalent, and the CH2 hydrogens are all equivalent as well. So, two distinct types of H. But that would mean total of two, which is not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Alternatively, if the final product is norbornene-based but with some substituents that create symmetry, leading to specific H environments.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a structure with more symmetry, leading to fewer distinct Hs.

Wait, going back, perhaps the final product has three distinct types of Hs. Let's say, for example, some Hs are on a bridge, some are on a ring, etc.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's challenging. Maybe I should think about the possible answers. The options are 4,7,8,10. If the molecule has a lot of symmetry, perhaps the number is lower, like 4 or 8. If the structure is more complex and asymmetric, the number could be higher, like 10.

Wait, considering the starting material has a tert-butoxy group, which is a bulky substituent, perhaps the final product has a structure where this group remains, contributing to some unique Hs.

Wait, perhaps the final product has 8 distinct Hs. So, the answer is A)8.

Alternatively, maybe after elimination, the product has a more symmetric structure, leading to fewer distinct Hs.

Hmm. Alternatively, in the initial structure, the tert-butoxy group is at position 7, which is part of the bicyclo system. After all the reactions, perhaps this group remains, but the rest of the structure becomes more symmetric.

Wait, another approach: count the number of H environments in each step.

Let me think about the starting material: 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene.

The bicyclo has 7 carbons. The substituent is tert-butoxy at position 7. The structure has two double bonds. So, the molecule might have several H environments.

After the Diels-Alder, product 1 is a more complex structure with two additional rings, each with CH2Br substituents. Then, after treatment with H2SO4, these become CH2OH. Then, sulfonation converts them to CH2OSO3H. Heating forms double bonds, leading to a more rigid structure.

Assuming that in the final product, the elimination leads to the formation of two new double bonds, perhaps creating a more symmetric structure.

Wait, perhaps the final product is a norbornene derivative with two new double bonds, making it a more rigid structure with several equivalent Hs.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a cubane structure, which has 8 equivalent Hs. But cubane has eight Hs, all equivalent. So, the number would be 1.

Wait, but 8 is one of the options. Hmm.

Alternatively, the final product might have some symmetry, leading to 8 distinct Hs.

But without knowing the exact structure, I'm really just guessing.

Wait, maybe I should think about the process again.

After the Diels-Alder, the product has two CH2Br groups. After H2SO4, they become CH2OH. Sulfonation leads to CH2OSO3H. Heating eliminates these groups, forming double bonds.

So, if each CH2OSO3H is on a carbon adjacent to another CH2OSO3H, elimination would form a double bond between them, creating a conjugated diene.

So, perhaps the final product has two new double bonds, leading to a structure with more rings.

Wait, if the starting norbornadiene has two double bonds, and after Diels-Alder, two more rings are added, perhaps the final product after elimination would have a structure similar to a cubane or adamantane.

Assuming the final product has a structure with a high degree of symmetry, perhaps with multiple equivalent Hs.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a tricyclic compound where certain Hs are equivalent.

But I'm not making progress here. Let me think about the possible answer options again.

If the correct answer is 7 (option D), perhaps the structure has seven unique Hs. Alternatively, option B is 4, which would imply a lot of symmetry.

But I'm not certain. Another approach: perhaps the final product after all reactions is adamantane. Adamantane has 10 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms, but in a very symmetric structure. But I'm not sure.

Wait, no, adamantane has 10 carbons and 18 hydrogens, but the number of chemically distinct hydrogens is more than one. Wait, no, each H in adamantane is in a unique environment. So, the number of distinct Hs would be 10, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure after elimination leads to a structure with 10 distinct Hs. So, the answer would be C)10.

Wait, but I'm actually not confident. Another thought: perhaps the final product has 8 H environments. So, the answer is A)8.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a molecule with a structure that has 7 distinct Hs. So, the answer is D)7.

I think I'm stuck, but based on the prior steps, the elimination leads to a more symmetric structure, perhaps with fewer distinct Hs. Maybe the answer is 8, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about possible elimination. Each CH2OSO3H group is on adjacent carbons, so elimination would form a double bond between them. So, each elimination would create a new double bond.

If there are two such eliminations, perhaps two new double bonds are formed, making the molecule more rigid and with more symmetry.

In such a structure, perhaps the molecule has a certain symmetry, leading to a specific number of H environments.

But without the exact structure, it's hard to say. Maybe the correct answer is 7.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 8. I'm going to take a guess that the correct answer is A)8.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. The first step is a reaction with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide, likely forming a Diels-Alder adduct. The norbornadiene acts as the diene, and the cyclohexadiene with dibromomethyl groups serves as the dienophile. This results in two Diels-Alder reactions, as there are two double bonds in the norbornadiene and two equivalents of dienophile are used. The product (product 1) likely has two CH2Br substituents added.

In the second step, treatment with aqueous sulfuric acid converts the CH2Br groups into CH2OH groups via hydrolysis. 

In the third step, treatment with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO sulfonates the CH2OH groups, converting them into CH2OSO3H groups.

In the final step, heating at 150Â°C leads to elimination of the sulfonate groups, forming double bonds. This elimination likely results in a more rigid and conjugated structure, potentially with increased symmetry.

The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product (product 4). The analysis considers the symmetry of the final structure and the elimination process. While the exact structure is unclear, the elimination step likely forms a rigid, conjugated system with some symmetry. Based on the reasoning, the final product is hypothesized to have 8 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.

Answer: A
