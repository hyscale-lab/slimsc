Okay, so I've got this question about detecting transiting planets, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's break down the problem step by step.

The question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected using the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. But both have the same mass. The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So, if Planet_2's period is, say, P, Planet_1's is P/3.

The planets have circular orbits, which is good because that simplifies things. Now, their host stars have different masses but the same radii. The host of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. Oh wait, but the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved. Hmm, but since both stars have the same radius, that's an important point.

The researchers want to observe the planet with the highest probability of transiting. Transit probability depends on certain factors, right? From what I remember, the probability that a planet transits its star is given by the formula P = R*/a, where R* is the radius of the star and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But wait, no, that's not exactly right. Let me think again. The transit probability (P) is the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis. So, P = (R*) / (a) multiplied by some other factors, maybe an inclination thing? Oh wait, no, that's the probability when considering edge-on alignment, which is the condition for transit. The actual probability depends on the alignment, but I think for Earth-like planets, the maximum probability is when the orbital plane is edge-on.

But wait, another factor is the size of the planet relative to the star. Oh, but I think the question is more about whether the planet is more likely to transit, which depends on the size of the star and the size of the planet's orbit. Because if the semi-major axis is small (the planet is closer), the chances of the orbital plane being aligned such that we see a transit are higher.

Wait, another formula comes to mind. The transit probability can be approximated by (R* / a), assuming that the orbital inclination is randomly distributed. So, the probability increases when the semi-major axis is smaller. Also, if the star is larger, the probability increases as well, because a larger star makes the transit more probable for a given a.

Wait, let me get this right. The probability of a transit is higher when the semi-major axis is smaller (so planet is closer) and the star is larger. Because the chance that the planet's path intersects our line of sight is higher when the orbit is closer (smaller a) and the star is bigger (so the disk is larger, making the transit more likely).

So, the formula for the transit probability is P = (R*/a), but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think: for a circular orbit, the probability P is (R* / a) multiplied by 1/(sin i), but if the inclination i is random, the average probability would be (R*/a) * (1/(sqrt(2))) because the average of 1/sin i over all possible i is 1/sqrt(2). Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing this up. Another approach: the transit probability is the area of the star's disk divided by the area of the planet's orbit as seen from Earth. Hmm, but that's more about the chance of a transit happening given the relative sizes. Alternatively, the geometric probability that the planet's path crosses our line of sight is (R* / a), because the planet's orbital plane has a certain area, and the chance that it's aligned so that we see a transit is proportional to (R* / a). So, yes, I think P ≈ (R* / a).

So, to calculate the transit probability, I need R* and a for each planet. But wait, the question gives the masses of the host stars, not the radii. Oh, but the problem states that both host stars have the same radii. So R* is the same for both stars. So, R1 = R2 = R.

So, the probability then depends only on the semi-major axis, a. Because P = R* / a.

But wait, the planets' semi-major axes are related to their orbital periods via Kepler's third law. Kepler's law says that (a^3) / (P^2) = (G(M + m)) / (4π²). But since the planets' masses are much smaller than the stars', we can approximate M + m ≈ M, the mass of the star. So, a³ = [G M (P)² ] / (4 π²). So a is proportional to (M * P²)^(1/3).

Wait, so a is proportional to (M * P²)^(1/3). Because M is the mass of the host star, and P is the orbital period.

So, for each planet, a1 and a2:

a1 = [ G * M1 * (P1)^2 / (4π²) ]^(1/3)
a2 = [ G * M2 * (P2)^2 / (4π²) ]^(1/3)

But because G, 4π² are constants, we can write a1/a2 as [ (M1/M2) * (P1² / P2²) ]^(1/3)

Given that M1 is twice M2 (M1 = 2 M2). And P1 is P2 / 3.

So, M1/M2 = 2/1.

P1² / P2² = ( (P2/3)² ) / P2² = (P2² /9) / P2² = 1/9.

So, a1/a2 = [ (2) * (1/9) ]^(1/3) = (2/9)^(1/3) = approximately (0.222)^(1/3). Let me compute that.

The cube root of 0.222... is around 0.6, because 0.6^3 is 0.216, which is close to 0.222. So roughly 0.6.

So a1 is about 0.6 times a2.

Wait, but since a is in the denominator for the transit probability, a smaller a means higher probability.

So, transit probability for Planet 1 is P1 = R* / a1.

Transit probability for Planet 2 is P2 = R* / a2.

So, P1/P2 = (R*/a1) / (R*/a2) ) = a2/a1.

We found that a1 ≈ 0.6 a2. So a2/a1 is about 1/0.6 ≈ 1.666... times.

So P1 is approximately 1.666 times P2. So the probability for Planet_1 is higher than that of Planet_2.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation because I might have messed up the exponents.

Wait, let's do it more precisely.

Compute a1/a2:

a1/a2 = [ (M1/M2) * (P1² / P2²) ]^(1/3) = [ (2) * ( (P1 / P2)^2 ) ]^(1/3 )

Given that P1 is (1/3) P2, so (P1/P2) is 1/3. So (P1^2 / P2^2) is (1/3)^2 = 1/9.

So a1/a2 = [ (2)*(1/9) ]^(1/3 ) = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ (0.2222)^(1/3).

Let me compute 0.2222^(1/3). Let's see:

0.6^3 = 0.216, which is just about 0.222. So approximately 0.605.

So a1 ≈ 0.605 * a2.

So a1 is about 60.5% of a2.

So, when computing the transit probabilities:

P1 = R*/a1.

P2 = R*/a2.

So, P1/P2 = (R*/a1) / (R*/a2) ) = a2/a1 ≈ 1/0.605 ≈ 1.652.

So, P1 is about 1.65 times P2.

So, Planet_1 has a higher probability to transit. Now, looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D says 2.7 times, which seems too high.

So the correct choice is C: Planet_1 is preferred. Because the transit probability for Planet_1 is about 1.65 times that of Planet_2.

Wait, but let me check: because a1 is smaller, P1 is higher. So yes, the transit probability is higher for Planet_1.

So the researchers would choose to observe Planet_1 because it has a higher probability of transiting, about 1.65 times higher than Planet_2.

To determine which planet has the higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, \( P = \frac{R^*}{a} \), where \( R^* \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R^* \)), the probability depends on the semi-major axis \( a \). A smaller \( a \) results in a higher transit probability.

Using Kepler's third law, \( a^3 \propto M \cdot P^2 \), where \( M \) is the mass of the host star and \( P \) is the orbital period of the planet, we calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes for Planet_1 and Planet_2:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left( \frac{M_1}{M_2} \cdot \frac{P_1^2}{P_2^2} \right)^{1/3}
\]

Given that \( M_1 = 2 \cdot M_2 \) and \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \), we substitute:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left( \frac{2}{1} \cdot \frac{(1/3)^2}{1^2} \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{2}{9} \right)^{1/3} \approx 0.605
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.605 \cdot a_2 \), meaning Planet_1's semi-major axis is smaller than Planet_2's. Since transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), the transit probability ratio is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{R^*/a_1}{R^*/a_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx \frac{1}{0.605} \approx 1.65
\]

Therefore, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. The researchers would prefer observing Planet_1 due to its higher probability of transiting.

**Option Analysis:**
- **A)** Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred; Planet_1 has a higher transit probability.
- **B)** Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred, and the transit probability ratio is not 1.5.
- **C)** Correct. Planet_1 is preferred, and its transit probability is approximately 1.65 times higher than Planet_2's.
- **D)** Incorrect. The transit probability ratio is not 2.7.

So, for each planet, a1 and a2:

a1 = [ G * M1 * (P1)^2 / (4π²) ]^(1/3)
a2 = [ G * M2 * (P2)^2 / (4π²) ]^(1/3)

Given that M1 is twice M2 (M1 = 2 M2). And P1 is P2 / 3.

So, M1/M2 = 2/1.

P1² / P2² = ( (P2/3)² ) / P2² = (P2² /9) / P2² = 1/9.

So, a1/a2 = [ (2) * (1/9) ]^(1/3) = (2/9)^(1/3) = approximately (0.222)^(1/3). Let me compute that.

The cube root of 0.222... is around 0.6, because 0.6^3 is 0.216, which is close to 0.222. So roughly 0.6.

So a1/a2 = [ (2)*(1/9) ]^(1/3 ) = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ (0.2222)^(1/3).

Let me compute 0.2222^(1/3). Let's see:

0.6^3 = 0.216, which is just about 0.222. So approximately 0.605.

So a1 ≈ 0.605 * a2.
