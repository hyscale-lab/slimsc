Okay, so I've got this electrochemistry question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the behavior of oxygen as an oxidant in different solutions and how its reaction rate changes.

The question says: Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions. Then I have to pick the correct combination from the options A to D.

Hmm, I remember that in electrochemistry, the strength of an oxidant relates to its tendency to gain electrons, which is about the thermodynamic favorability. On the other hand, the kinetic aspect has to do with how fast the reaction occurs, which depends on factors like activation energy and the conditions of the solution.

So, first part: Thermodynamically, oxygen as an oxidant in basic solutions. I think about standard reduction potentials. In basic conditions, the presence of OH- ions might influence the reaction. For example, the reaction of O2 in basic conditions is O2 + 2H2O + 4e- → 4OH-. The standard reduction potential for this reaction is, I think, around +0.40 V. In acidic conditions, the same O2 would have a higher potential? Wait no, in acidic, it's O2 + 4H+ + 4e- → 2H2O, and I recall the standard E is about +1.23 V. So higher in acidic. That means in acidic, O2 is a stronger oxidant because higher E° indicates a greater tendency to be reduced.

Wait, but the question is about basic solutions. So if in basic solution, the E° is lower than in acidic, that would mean it's a weaker oxidant in basic compared to acidic. So thermodynamically, in basic solutions, O2 is a weaker oxidant than in acidic solutions. So the first blank would be 'weaker'.

Now the second part: Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions. Kinetics are about the rate. So even if a reaction is thermodynamically favorable, it might be slow if the activation energy is high.

I remember that in acidic solutions, the reaction of O2 (like in the oxygen electrode) is faster. Or wait, no, wait. Maybe it's the opposite. Because in acidic solutions, the presence of H+ ions could make the reaction proceed more quickly. Or perhaps because in basic conditions, the O2 reaction is slower because of the higher pH affecting the reaction rate.

Wait, the reaction in acidic is more likely to have a higher reaction rate because the H+ ions can help stabilize the transition state or perhaps the reaction involves H+ in the mechanism. Alternatively, maybe the reaction in acidic has lower activation energy.

Alternatively, I think about how the rate of oxygen reduction can be influenced by the solution's pH. In acidic solutions, the reaction O2 + 4H+ +4e- → 2H2O would have H+ ions available, which might lower the activation energy because the reaction can proceed through a protonated pathway that's more favorable. So the reaction would be faster in acidic solutions.

So for the kinetic part, O2 reacts faster in acidic solutions.

Putting it together: The first blank is 'weaker' because in basic solutions, the oxidizing power is lower. The second blank is 'faster' because in acidic, the reaction occurs more quickly.

Looking at the options:

A) stronger – faster → No, because first part is weaker.

B) stronger – slower → No.

C) weaker – faster → Yes, this matches.

D) weaker - slower → No.

So the correct answer is option C: weaker – faster.

Thermodynamically, the strength of an oxidant is determined by its reduction potential. For oxygen, the reduction reaction in acidic solutions is:

\[
\text{O}_2 + 4\text{H}^+ + 4\text{e}^- \rightarrow 2\text{H}_2\text{O}, \quad E^\circ = +1.23 \, \text{V}.
\]

In basic solutions, the reduction reaction is:

\[
\text{O}_2 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} + 4\text{e}^- \rightarrow 4\text{OH}^-, \quad E^\circ = +0.40 \, \text{V}.
\]

Since the standard reduction potential is lower in basic solutions, oxygen is a weaker oxidant in basic solutions compared to acidic solutions.

Kinetically, the reaction rate depends on factors like activation energy and the availability of ions. In acidic solutions, the presence of \(\text{H}^+\) ions facilitates the reduction of oxygen by stabilizing intermediates or lowering the activation energy. This makes the reaction proceed faster in acidic solutions compared to basic solutions, where the reaction is slower due to the absence of \(\text{H}^+\) ions and the higher pH.

Thus, the correct combination is "weaker – faster."

Okay, so I've got this electrochemistry question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the behavior of oxygen as an oxidant in different solutions and how its reaction rate changes.

Thermodynamically, the strength of an oxidant is determined by its reduction potential. For oxygen, the reduction reaction in acidic solutions is:

\[
\text{O}_2 + 4\text{H}^+ + 4\text{e}^- \rightarrow 2\text{H}_2\text{O}, \quad E^\circ = +1.23 \, \text{V}.

In basic solutions, the reduction reaction is:

\[
\text{O}_2 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} + 4\text{e}^- \rightarrow 4\text{OH}^-, \quad E^\circ = +0.40 \, \text{V}.

Since the standard reduction potential is lower in basic solutions, oxygen is a weaker oxidant in basic solutions compared to acidic solutions.

Kinetically, the reaction rate depends on factors like activation energy and the availability of ions. In acidic solutions, the presence of \(\text{H}^+\) ions facilitates the reduction of oxygen by stabilizing intermediates or lowering the activation energy. This makes the reaction proceed faster in acidic solutions compared to basic solutions, where the reaction is slower due to the absence of \(\text{H}^+\) ions and the higher pH.

Thus, the correct combination is "weaker – faster."
