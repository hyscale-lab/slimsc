Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read the question again. It says: What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?

Hmm. I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency, also known as the degree of unsaturation, is a way to count the number of rings and double bonds in a molecule. Each ring or double bond contributes one to the index. So, the product of this reaction will have a certain structure, and I need to calculate that.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let me try to visualize its structure. So, it's a cyclohexene ring with substituents. The 3-enecarboxylic acid part means there's a double bond at position 3 (so between carbons 3 and 4 in the cyclohexane ring) and a carboxylic acid group at position 2. Wait, no, wait. Wait, cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with one double bond. The numbering here: 3-enecarboxylic acid would have the double bond between C3 and C4, and the carboxylic acid at C2. Oh, but wait, 2-formyl means a formyl group (CHO) is attached at position 2. And 5-vinyl means a vinyl group (CH2CH2?) Wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH-, right? So at position 5 of the cyclohexene ring, there's a vinyl substituent. So the structure: cyclohexene ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, a carboxylic acid group (COOH) at C2, a formyl group (CHO) at C2? Wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, 2-formyl is the position. So the cyclohexene is the ring, with substituents at positions 2 and 5. So position 2 has a formyl group, position 5 has a vinyl group, and there's a double bond in the ring at position 3 (so positions 3 and 4 are double bonded). Also, the carboxylic acid is at position 2? Wait, no. Wait, the name is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Oh, wait, 'cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid' suggests that the carboxylic acid is part of the ring? No, wait, no. No, the cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid would be a cyclohexene ring (with a double bond at position 3) with a carboxylic acid group attached. So the ring has a substituent at a specific position.

Wait, perhaps the structure is: the cyclohexene has a double bond between C3 and C4. Then, at position 2 of the ring, there is a formyl group (CHO), and at position 5, a vinyl group (CH2CH2? No, vinyl is CH₂=CH–). So the substituents are at C2 and C5 of the cyclohexene ring, which already has a double bond between C3 and C4. Also, the molecule is a carboxylic acid, so the COOH is attached to position 1? Wait, no. Wait, the 'cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid' implies that the carboxylic acid is at position 1, since the numbering starts from the carboxylic acid. Wait, no. Wait, the numbering of the ring starts such that the substituents get the lowest possible numbers. So for cyclohexene, the double bond is between C1 and C2, but in this case, the double bond is between C3 and C4, which suggests that the carboxylic acid is at C1, perhaps.

Wait, maybe it's better to sketch this mentally. So, cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with one double bond. The substituents are a formyl group at position 2, a vinyl group at position 5, and a carboxylic acid group at position 1. Wait, but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is as follows: the cyclohexene ring has a double bond between C3 and C4. Then, at C2, there's a formyl group (CHO), and at C5, a vinyl group (CH₂–CH₂ but with a double bond? No, vinyl is CH₂=CH– as a substituent. So, the ring would have substituents at C2 and C5.

So, the starting molecule has a cyclohexene ring with a double bond (between C3 and C4), a formyl group at C2, a vinyl group at C5, and a carboxylic acid group. Wait, but where is the carboxylic acid attached? Oh, wait, the name is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the 'carboxylic acid' part is at position 1 (since the substituents are numbered starting from the carboxylic acid group). So the ring is numbered such that the carboxylic acid is at position 1, then positions 2,3,4,5,6 follow.

So, position 1: COOH group.

Position 2: formyl group (CHO).

Position 3: part of the double bond (since the ring is cyclohex-3-ene, the double bond is between C3 and C4.

Position 5: vinyl group (CH₂=CH– attached to C5.

So the structure is a cyclohexene ring with substituents at positions 1 (COOH), 2 (CHO), and 5 (CH₂=CH–). The double bond in the ring is between C3 and C4.

Now, the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. I remember that red phosphorus is used in the hydrolysis of nitriles or in certain eliminations, but more importantly, in this context, it's probably a dehydrohalogenation or maybe a different reaction. Wait, wait. Red phosphorus and HI is a reagent system often used in the hydrolysis of nitriles, but that's not relevant here. Another possibility: in the presence of HI and red phosphorus, it's used for the elimination of certain groups. Alternatively, perhaps this is a scenario where the carboxylic acid is being converted into something else.

Wait, maybe it's a reaction involving the carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids can react with HI, perhaps undergoing decarboxylation under certain conditions. Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of the cyclohexene ring undergoing some addition.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think. The reaction is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid with red phosphorus and excess HI.

Another thought: Red phosphorus is sometimes used in the presence of HI for the deoxygenation of ketones or aldehydes. Wait, wait, yes! I remember that the Clemmensen reduction uses Zn(Hg)/HCl, but another method is using red phosphorus and HI for the reduction of carbonyl groups to alkanes. So, formyl groups (CHO) can be reduced to CH₂OH (but wait, maybe not exactly, because the conditions might vary).

Wait, but in the presence of excess HI and red phosphorus, the carbonyl groups (like aldehydes) would be converted into CH₂ groups. Let's think. The formyl group is CHO, which upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI would become CH₂I. Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps it's a more straightforward reduction. Let me think again: the formyl group is an aldehyde. The Clemmensen reduction would reduce it to CH₂ group, but if we use something else, like LiAlH4, it would reduce to CH₂OH. But in this case, with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps it's a different pathway. Oh wait, maybe the formyl group is being converted to a CH₂ group. Because I think red phosphorus and HI can act as a reducing agent for carbonyl groups. So the CHO group becomes CH₂I, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, let me think about the reaction mechanism. The reaction of an aldehyde (RCHO) with red phosphorus and HI might proceed via the formation of an intermediate. Red phosphorus can react with HI to form phosphine and other intermediates. The aldehyde would get converted to an aldehyde iodide, perhaps. Then, the aldehyde group (CHO) would be converted to CH₂I, but perhaps in the presence of excess HI and red phosphorus, it might further react.

Wait, actually, I think I'm getting this wrong. Another approach: think about the overall reaction conditions. So when an aldehyde (RCHO) is treated with red phosphorus and excess HI, the aldehyde group is reduced. Wait, but in what way? Let me recall: I think that with H2O and HCl, the aldehyde would form a geminal diol. But that's in the presence of HCl and H2O. Alternatively, in the presence of HI and red phosphorus, perhaps the aldehyde is reduced to a CH₂ group, with the addition of two hydrogens. So RCHO → RCH₂–. So the formyl group (CHO) becomes CH₂I, but wait, no, perhaps it becomes CH₂– group. Let me think. Maybe the aldehyde group (CHO) is reduced to CH₂I. Or perhaps it's CH₂– something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the formyl group is converted into a primary alcohol, but under these conditions, maybe not. Another thought: Maybe the aldehyde is converted into a CH₂ group, which would mean that the formyl (CHO) becomes CH₂–.

So, in the starting molecule, the 2-formyl group is at position 2. So after the reaction, it becomes CH₂–.

But wait, what about the carboxylic acid group? The starting molecule has -COOH at position 1. How does that react with HI and red phosphorus?

Carboxylic acids can undergo various reactions. When treated with HI, perhaps it could undergo substitution if there's a leaving group. But in this case, the carboxylic acid is -COOH. Hmm. Alternatively, the -COOH group might be converted into something else. But wait, in the presence of red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the carboxylic acid is transformed. I think that red phosphorus and HI can be used to convert carboxylic acids into alkanes. Wait, I remember that when a carboxylic acid is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it can undergo a reaction called the von Braun degradation, but that's more about converting amides. Alternatively, perhaps the carboxylic acid is deprotonated and then reacts.

Alternatively, another approach: perhaps the reaction conditions are leading to the formation of an alkane. So the -COOH group would be converted into a CH2 group.

Wait, but I'm a bit rusty on this. Let me think about the overall reaction. The starting material is a cyclohexene ring with substituents. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI may cause the ring to undergo hydrogenation, but I don't think so because red phosphorus isn't a catalyst for hydrogenation. Alternatively, perhaps the double bonds in the ring are being hydrogenated, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction might be a diels-alder reaction, but that's probably not it. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydration of the double bond, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the carboxylic acid is being converted into an acid chloride, but that's done with SOCl2, not HI and red phosphorus. Alternatively, maybe the carboxylic acid is undergoing some kind of elimination.

Wait, another angle: when you have a carboxylic acid group and an aldehyde group in the molecule, and you treat with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps both carbonyl groups are being reduced. So the formyl group (CHO) becomes CH₂–, and the carboxylic acid (COOH) becomes CH₂– as well.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the carboxylic acid is a COOH group. If it's reduced, perhaps it becomes CH₂OH. Alternatively, maybe it's transformed into a methyl group.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident about this. Let me think about each substituent:

1. The formyl group (CHO) at position 2: under these conditions, it might get reduced to CH₂–.

2. The carboxylic acid group (COOH) at position 1: perhaps it's converted into CH₂–.

Wait, but how? Because the COOH group is more oxidized than the aldehyde. So perhaps the reaction reduces both to CH₂ groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the carboxylic acid is being converted into an iodide. Let me think: the reaction conditions are HI and red phosphorus. Maybe the -COOH group reacts with HI to form an acyl iodide, but that typically requires PCl5 or something similar.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a decarboxylation. Under certain conditions, carboxylic acids can lose CO2. But in this case, with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps it's a decarboxylation. But how?

Wait, another thought: red phosphorus can act as a reducing agent. So maybe the reaction is a reduction of the double bonds in the ring and the aldehyde group.

Wait, the starting molecule has a cyclohexene ring with a double bond. So that's one double bond in the ring. It also has a vinyl group (CH₂=CH-) attached at position 5, which is another double bond. And the formyl group is a carbonyl (CHO), which is another double bond.

So in the starting material, the degrees of unsaturation would be:

Each ring or double bond contributes one. So the cyclohexene ring (one double bond) → 1. The vinyl group (another double bond) → 2. The formyl group (another double bond) → 3. The carboxylic acid group is a single bond with an -OH and a double bond within the COOH (so it contributes one, but wait, the COOH group is O=C(OH)₂? No, the structure is O=C(O-)OH, so it's a carbonyl group. So that's another double bond. So the total index would be 1 (ring) + 1 (vinyl) + 1 (formyl) + 1 (COOH) = 4. But wait, the cyclohexene ring is a six-membered ring with one double bond. So that's one ring (but wait, no, a cyclohexene is a ring with a double bond, so it's a cycloalkene. So that's one double bond, which counts as one. The vinyl group is another double bond, the formyl group another, and the COOH group another. So four double bonds in total.

But wait, the structure is a cyclohexene ring, so that's one double bond. The vinyl group is another (CH₂=CH–), which is another double bond. The formyl group is another (CHO), another double bond. The COOH group is another (COOH has a carbonyl group, another double bond). So total of four double bonds.

Alternatively, wait: the cyclohexene ring is a six-membered ring with one double bond, so that contributes one. The vinyl group has a double bond, another. The formyl group has a carbonyl, another. The COOH group has a carbonyl, another. So that's four in total. So the index of hydrogen deficiency in the starting material is 4.

Now, when the reaction occurs with red phosphorus and excess HI, what changes? Well, the formyl group (CHO) might be reduced. Let's say it becomes CH₂OH, but that's probably if using a different reagent. Alternatively, if it's reduced to CH₂–. Wait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. The reaction of carbonyl groups with red phosphorus and HI leads to the formation of alkanes. So for example, RCHO → RCH2–. So the formyl group (CHO) becomes CH₂–.

Similarly, the COOH group would be transformed. If the reaction is reducing the carbonyl group to CH₂, then COOH would become CH₂OH? Or perhaps CH₂–.

Wait, another approach: the reaction of carboxylic acids with HI and red phosphorus. I think that under these conditions, the carboxylic acid is converted into an alkane. So, RCOOH → RCH2–. So the COOH group would be reduced to a CH₂ group.

So, in the product, the formyl group (CHO) becomes CH₂–, and the COOH group becomes CH₂– as well.

So the product would have:

- The cyclohexene ring (still has the double bond between C3 and C4, assuming no hydrogenation occurs).

- At position 2: a CH₂ group.

- At position 5: a vinyl group (still has the double bond, assuming it wasn't hydrogenated).

Wait, but wait. The vinyl group is CH₂=CH–. If the reaction is with HI and red phosphorus, which is a reagent that can add across double bonds, but in this case, perhaps it's a substitution reaction.

Alternatively, maybe the vinyl group (CH₂=CH–) is also a site for reaction. Would the red phosphorus and HI add to the vinyl group?

Wait, another thought: the reaction is probably a dihydroxylation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the double bonds are being hydrogenated, but I don't think red phosphorus and HI are used for that. Maybe the reaction is an addition to the double bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening of the cyclohexene, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps only the formyl and carboxylic acid groups are reacting, and the other double bonds (the cyclohexene and the vinyl) remain the same.

Wait, but the question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product. So I need to figure out how many double bonds and rings are present in the product.

Let me think step by step:

1. Starting molecule's structure: cyclohexene (1 double bond) with substituents.

2. Substituent groups:

   a. 2-formyl (CHO): another double bond.

   b. 5-vinyl (CH₂=CH–): another double bond.

   c. 3-enecarboxylic acid (COOH): another double bond.

Wait, wait, no. The 3-enecarboxylic acid is part of the cyclohexene ring. So the ring itself has a double bond, and the COOH group is a substituent with a carbonyl group (another double bond).

So initial degrees of unsaturation (DoU) calculation:

- Cyclohexene ring: 1 (from the ring and the double bond).

- Formyl group (CHO): 1.

- Vinyl group (CH₂=CH–): 1.

- COOH group: 1.

Total DoU: 4.

Now, after reaction with red phosphorus and HI:

- The formyl (CHO) group is reduced to CH₂–. So the carbonyl double bond is removed, which reduces the DoU by 1.

- The COOH group is also reduced. Let's say it's converted into CH₂–. So that's another DoU reduction by 1.

- The cyclohexene ring's double bond: does it change? If the reaction doesn't affect the ring, it remains, so DoU still contributes 1.

- The vinyl group (CH₂=CH–): if the reaction doesn't affect the vinyl group, then DoU remains 1.

Wait, but if the reaction adds HI across the double bonds, that would reduce the DoU. For example, if the cyclohexene ring's double bond is hydrogenated, then that would reduce DoU by 1. Similarly, if the vinyl group's double bond is hydrogenated, that would reduce DoU by another 1.

But I'm not sure if the reaction conditions do that. Let's think about what HI and red phosphorus do.

Red phosphorus and HI are known for their role in the reduction of carbonyl groups to alkanes. For example, the reduction of ketones to secondary alcohols, but in the presence of excess HI, perhaps further reaction occurs. Alternatively, the aldehyde group (CHO) is reduced to CH₂I or CH₂–.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could be adding HI across the double bonds, such as the cyclohexene and the vinyl groups. For each double bond that is hydrogenated, the DoU decreases by one.

So, product after reaction:

- If the formyl group is reduced (DoU down by 1).

- If the COOH is reduced (DoU down by 1).

- If the cyclohexene double bond is hydrogenated (DoU down by 1).

- If the vinyl group's double bond is hydrogenated (DoU down by 1).

So that would be a total reduction of 4 DoU, making the product have zero DoU. But that's if all four double bonds are hydrogenated. Alternatively, perhaps only some are.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't hydrogenate the cyclohexene ring or the vinyl group. Let me think: in the presence of red phosphorus and HI, the primary reaction is the reduction of carbonyl groups (the formyl and COOH groups) to CH₂ groups, while the other double bonds (cyclohexene ring and vinyl) remain unaffected.

So, in that case, DoU after reaction:

- Cyclohexene ring: 1.

- Vinyl group: 1.

- Formyl group: converted to CH₂, so no double bond anymore.

- COOH group: converted to CH₂, so no double bond.

So DoU would be 1 (cyclohexene) + 1 (vinyl) = 2.

But wait, what if the cyclohexene ring's double bond is also hydrogenated? Let's see, does the reaction conditions include hydrogenation of the ring?

Wait, I think that in the presence of red phosphorus and HI, the main reactions are the reduction of the formyl and COOH groups. The ring's double bond might not be hydrogenated unless there's a catalyst like H2 and a metal catalyst. So perhaps the ring remains as is.

So, in the product:

- The cyclohexene ring is still present, contributing 1 DoU.

- The vinyl group's double bond is still present, contributing another.

So that's a total of 2 DoU.

Wait, but this doesn't match any of the options. The options are 1,3,5,0.

Hmm. Let me re-examine my assumptions.

Wait, perhaps the reaction with red phosphorus and HI doesn't affect the cyclohexene ring. So the ring's double bond remains. So, the product's structure would have the cyclohexene ring (1 DoU), the vinyl group (1 DoU), and the other substituents (the formyl and COOH groups, now both CH₂ groups, so 0 DoU from them). So total DoU is 2.

But the options don't have 2. So I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the COOH group is being converted into something else. Let me think: when a carboxylic acid is treated with HI, perhaps it forms an acyl iodide. For example, RCOOH + HI → RCOI + H2O. Then, perhaps under these conditions, the acyl iodide could undergo further reaction.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the COOH group is being converted into a methyl group (CH3). So, in that case, the COOH's carbonyl (DoU) is gone.

Wait, another angle: what's the overall reaction of a carboxylic acid with red phosphorus and HI? I think that the reaction could convert the COOH group into CH3. Because when a carboxylic acid is treated with H2SO4 and H2O, it can form an acyl chloride, but with HI, perhaps it's a different pathway.

Alternatively, perhaps the carboxylic acid is being decarboxylated. Decarboxylation of a carboxylic acid usually requires heat and sometimes a catalyst. Decarboxylation of alpha-keto acids is common. But in this case, I don't know if the starting material is an alpha-keto acid.

Wait, the starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. The formyl group is at position 2, so adjacent to the COOH group at position 1. So the COOH is at position 1, and the formyl is at position 2. So the COOH is attached to position 1, and the formyl is attached to position 2.

Thus, the structure is cyclohexene ring with COOH at C1, CHO at C2, and CH₂=CH– at C5, and a double bond in the ring between C3 and C4.

So, the COOH is at C1, and the formyl is at C2. So, the two substituents are adjacent. So, the molecule has a structure where C1 is COOH, C2 is CHO, C5 is CH₂=CH–, and the ring has a double bond between C3 and C4.

Now, when the reaction occurs, the formyl (CHO) and COOH groups are reduced. Let's say the COOH is converted into CH2–, and the CHO into CH2– as well.

But what about the ring's double bond and the vinyl group's double bond? Do they change?

Wait, perhaps the ring's double bond is hydrogenated. So, the cyclohexene becomes a cyclohexane.

And the vinyl group's double bond is also hydrogenated, so the CH₂=CH– becomes CH₂–CH₂.

So, after the reaction, all double bonds are gone.

So, the product would be a cyclohexane ring (no DoU from the ring), with substituents at C1 (CH₂–), C2 (CH₂–), and C5 (CH₂–CH₂–). The other substituents are single bonds.

In this case, the product would have no double bonds and no rings, so the index of hydrogen deficiency is 0.

But wait, why would the ring's double bond be hydrogenated? Red phosphorus and HI are not typically used for hydrogenation of alkenes. Hydrogenation usually requires H2 and a catalyst. But perhaps the reaction conditions allow for some addition across the double bonds.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps only the formyl and COOH groups are being reduced, and the other double bonds remain.

Let me think again.

If the starting molecule has four double bonds (ring, formyl, COOH, vinyl), and after reaction, two of them are reduced, leaving two, the DoU would be 2.

But the options don't include 2, so I must be missing something else.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could cause the cyclohexene ring to open, but that's less likely without a strong acid or base.

Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl group is being hydrogenated. So, the vinyl's double bond is converted to a single bond, adding two hydrogens.

So, if the vinyl group's double bond is hydrogenated, that reduces DoU by 1.

If the formyl and COOH groups are reduced, each reducing DoU by 1 (total of 2).

The cyclohexene's double bond remains, contributing 1.

So total DoU would be 1.

But that's option A) 1.

Alternatively, if the cyclohexene's double bond is hydrogenated, but the vinyl is not, then:

Formyl and COOH reduced: -2 DoU.

Cyclohexene hydrogenated: -1 DoU.

Vinyl remains: 1 DoU.

Total DoU: 1.

But I'm not sure if the cyclohexene ring's double bond is hydrogenated.

Alternatively, perhaps all the double bonds except the cyclohexene are reduced, but I don't think so.

Wait, another approach: calculate the initial and final DoU.

The starting material has the following DoU:

- Cyclohexene ring: 1 (because a six-membered ring with one double bond is one DoU).

Wait, wait, no. The cyclohexene ring is a six-membered ring with a double bond. The ring itself is a six-membered ring, which without any double bonds would have a DoU of 1 (as a ring). But with a double bond, the DoU is 2: one from the ring, one from the double bond.

Wait, no! Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the index of hydrogen deficiency is calculated as:

DoU = (Double bonds + Rings)/2? No, no, the correct formula is:

DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2

But for organic compounds, X and N are usually negligible unless in heterocycles. But for this problem, I'll calculate it.

Let me calculate the molecular formula of the starting material.

The molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

The cyclohexene ring is C6H9O2 (but wait, let me think: cyclohexene is C6H10; but with substituents, the formula changes.

Alternatively, let me count the atoms.

Cyclohexene (C6H10). Then, substituents:

- At C1: COOH (COOH adds 2 O and 2 O in H2O, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the formula would be C6H9O2.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to figure out the molecular formula.

The starting material: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

Breaking it down:

- Cyclohexene: C6H10.

But with substituents:

- At C2: formyl group (CHO) → adds 1 C, 1 O.

- At C5: vinyl group (CH₂=CH–) → adds 2 C, 3 H (since the substituent is -CH₂CH₂? No, wait, the vinyl group is CH₂=CH–, which is a substituent. So adding 2 C and 2 H (since each CH2 group adds two H, but the double bond might affect it).

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the molecular formula.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of reaction changes.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Let me think about the product. Suppose that the formyl and COOH groups are reduced to CH₂ groups, and the cyclohexene and vinyl double bonds are hydrogenated.

Then, the product would be a cyclohexane ring (no double bonds, no rings) with substituents at C1 (CH2), C2 (CH2), and C5 (CH2CH2).

But wait, the cyclohexane ring is a six-membered ring with no double bonds, which would have a DoU of 1 (from the ring).

So the product would have:

- Cyclohexane ring: 1 DoU.

- Any remaining double bonds?

If the vinyl group's double bond is hydrogenated, it's CH2CH2, so no DoU.

So total DoU would be 1.

But the options include 1 as option A.

But wait, I thought the cyclohexane ring has a DoU of 1 (from the ring). So the product would have 1 DoU.

So the answer would be A) 1.

But wait, wait. The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring after hydrogenation. So cyclohexane has a ring, which is one DoU.

But if the reaction conditions don't hydrogenate the ring, then the product would have the cyclohexene ring (DoU 1 from the ring and 1 from the double bond, totaling 2) plus any other double bonds.

But this is getting confusing. Perhaps I should think about each substituent's effect.

Wait, the reaction is with HI and red phosphorus. So the main reactions would be:

1. Reduction of the formyl group (CHO) to CH2–.

2. Reduction of the COOH group to CH2–.

3. Potential addition of HI to double bonds (if possible), but I'm not sure.

If only the formyl and COOH groups are reduced, then:

Original DoU: 4 (ring double bond, vinyl, formyl, COOH).

After reduction: formyl and COOH are CH2, so DoU decreases by 2 → 2.

The remaining DoU would come from the cyclohexene and vinyl groups.

If the cyclohexene and vinyl double bonds remain, then DoU = 2.

But none of the options have 2.

So perhaps I'm wrong, and the reaction also hydrogenates the cyclohexene and vinyl groups.

Then, after reaction, the cyclohexene becomes cyclohexane (ring, 1 DoU), and the vinyl becomes CH2CH2 (no DoU). So the total DoU is 1.

Which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexene ring isn't hydrogenated, so the product has a cyclohexene ring (DoU 2) and a hydrogenated vinyl group (DoU 0). So total DoU would be 2, which isn't an option.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't affect the cyclohexene ring, so the product has:

DoU from cyclohexene (1), vinyl (1), and the other substituents are CH2, so total DoU is 2.

But again, no option for 2.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in calculating the initial DoU.

Wait, the starting molecule: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

The structure is a cyclohexene ring with substituents.

The cyclohexene ring has one double bond.

The substituents are:

- At position 2: CHO (which is a carbonyl group, another double bond).

- At position 5: vinyl (CH₂=CH–, another double bond.

- At position 1: COOH (another carbonyl, another double bond.

So DoU is:

Cyclohexene ring: 1.

CHO: 1.

Vinyl: 1.

COOH: 1.

Total: 4.

After reaction, formyl and COOH are CH2, so DoU down by 2 → 2.

If the cyclohexene and vinyl double bonds are hydrogenated, DoU down by 2 → 0.

But if only the formyl and COOH are reduced, DoU is 2.

But the options are 0,1,3,5.

Hmm. So perhaps the reaction leads to the loss of all four DoU, making the product with 0.

How? If all four DoU are eliminated.

Which would mean:

- The cyclohexene ring is hydrogenated to cyclohexane (ring DoU 1 → 0).

Wait, wait, no. A cyclohexane ring has one DoU (the ring). So reducing the ring's DoU from 1 to 0 would require opening the ring, which is unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring opens, but that's not common under these reaction conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexene ring's double bond is hydrogenated (DoU down by 1), and the vinyl group's DoU is down by 1.

So, starting with 4 DoU, after reduction of formyl (down 1), COOH (down 1), cyclohexene (down 1), vinyl (down 1), total DoU is 0.

So the product has no double bonds or rings, so DoU is 0.

But how would that happen? Because for each double bond, hydrogenation requires adding two H. So with excess HI, perhaps that can happen.

But is HI and red phosphorus sufficient to hydrogenate all the double bonds?

I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps in this reaction, all the double bonds are hydrogenated.

So, product would have:

- Cyclohexane ring (no DoU from the ring, as it's a saturated ring? No, a cyclohexane ring has one DoU (the ring itself), regardless of any double bonds.

Wait, no. Wait, a cyclohexane ring has a ring, which is one DoU. A cyclohexene has a ring plus a double bond, so two DoU.

So, if the cyclohexene ring's double bond is hydrogenated, it becomes cyclohexane (ring, 1 DoU). The vinyl group's double bond is hydrogenated, so becomes a single bond (no DoU). The formyl and COOH groups are reduced (no DoU from them).

So total DoU is 1 (from the cyclohexane ring).

So the answer would be A)1.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the reaction only reduces the formyl and COOH groups, leaving the ring and vinyl double bonds intact. Then, the product's DoU would be:

ring (1) + vinyl (1) → 2. But that's not an option.

Hmm. So without a clear answer, perhaps the correct answer is 1, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't hydrogenate the cyclohexene ring. So, the product has:

- Ring DoU: 1.

- Vinyl DoU: 1.

- Formyl and COOH: 0.

Total: 2. Not an option.

So perhaps the correct answer is 1, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the product has all double bonds hydrogenated, making the ring do not contribute as the ring is broken.

Wait, another angle: the reaction with HI and red phosphorus leads to the formation of an acetal or something else, but that seems unrelated.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diol, but I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Strecker synthesis, but that's for amino acids.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction conditions result in the formation of a ketal, but again, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material's structure is different. Maybe the carboxylic acid is at position 3, and the formyl is at position 2, making the ring's double bond between positions 3 and 4. But that doesn't change the DoU count.

Wait, the problem is probably designed to have the product's DoU as 1, but I'm not sure.

Another approach: think about the product structure.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

After reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI, the formyl group (CHO) would become CH₂–, and the COOH group would become CH₂–.

The cyclohexene ring's double bond may or may not be hydrogenated, and the vinyl group's double bond may or may not be hydrogenated.

If all double bonds are hydrogenated, the product is a cyclohexane ring (1 DoU from the ring), with substituents at C2, C5, and C1 as CH₂ groups.

So DoU is 1.

If the ring isn't hydrogenated, the product has the ring (DoU 2) and the vinyl group (DoU 1), and formyl and COOH reduced. So DoU would be 3.

But the options have 3 as option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't affect the vinyl group or the ring, so the product has:

DoU from ring (1), vinyl (1), and the other substituents (0).

Total DoU 2. No option.

Hmm. Perhaps the correct answer is B) 3.

Wait, but why?

Wait, if the reaction doesn't hydrogenate any of the double bonds except the formyl and COOH groups, the product would have:

ring DoU 2 (from the ring and double bond), vinyl DoU 1, formyl and COOH DoU 0.

So total DoU: 3.

Which is option B.

But why would the ring's double bond not be hydrogenated? Because the reaction conditions (HI and red phosphorus) don't affect it. So perhaps only the carbonyl groups are reduced, and the other double bonds remain.

In that case, the product has:

ring (DoU 2: one for the ring, one for the double bond),

vinyl (DoU 1),

formyl and COOH (DoU 0).

So total DoU: 3.

So the correct answer would be B)3.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction converts the cyclohexene into a cyclohexane (DoU 1), the vinyl into CH2CH2 (DoU 0), and the formyl and COOH into CH2 groups (DoU 0). So total DoU is 1.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction only reduces the formyl and COOH groups, leaving the other double bonds intact. So DoU is 2, but that's not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is 3.

Wait, I think I've made a mistake in the initial DoU calculation.

Let me recalculate the DoU of the starting material.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

The structure is a cyclohexene ring (which is a six-membered ring with one double bond → 2 DoU (one for the ring, one for the double bond)).

Wait, no, wait. The cyclohexene is a ring with one double bond, so DoU is 2. Because a six-membered ring has one DoU, and a double bond adds another.

So the starting material's DoU:

- Cyclohexene: 2.

- Formyl group: 1.

- Vinyl group: 1.

- COOH group: 1.

Total: 2 +1 +1 +1 =5.

Ah! That's where I made a mistake earlier. The cyclohexene contributes 2 DoU (ring and double bond), not 1. So the total initial DoU is 5.

After reaction, if the formyl and COOH groups are reduced (each DoU decreases by 1, so 2 DoU lost), the remaining DoU would be 3.

So, the product would have:

- Cyclohexene's ring and double bond: 2 DoU.

- Vinyl group: 1 DoU.

Total: 3 DoU.

Which is option B)3.

So the correct answer is B)3.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question asks for the index of hydrogen deficiency (DoU) of the product formed when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI. The DoU is calculated based on the number of rings and double bonds in the molecule, with each contributing one to the index.

### Step 1: Analyze the starting material
The starting material, 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, has the following features:
1. **Cyclohexene ring**: A six-membered ring with one double bond. This contributes **2 DoU** (1 for the ring and 1 for the double bond).
2. **Formyl group (CHO)**: A carbonyl group, contributing **1 DoU**.
3. **Vinyl group (CH₂=CH–)**: A double bond, contributing **1 DoU**.
4. **Carboxylic acid group (COOH)**: A carbonyl group, contributing **1 DoU**.

Thus, the total **DoU of the starting material is 5**.

### Step 2: Reaction with red phosphorus and HI
Red phosphorus and HI are reducing agents. Under these conditions:
1. **Formyl group (CHO)**: Reduced to CH₂, eliminating its double bond and reducing the DoU by 1.
2. **Carboxylic acid group (COOH)**: Reduced to CH₂, eliminating its double bond and reducing the DoU by 1.
3. **Cyclohexene ring**: The double bond in the ring may or may not be affected. If it remains, it contributes 2 DoU (1 for the ring and 1 for the double bond).
4. **Vinyl group (CH₂=CH–)**: The double bond may or may not be hydrogenated. If it remains, it contributes 1 DoU.

### Step 3: Determine the DoU of the product
Assuming the reaction reduces the formyl and carboxylic acid groups but does not affect the cyclohexene ring or the vinyl group:
- **Cyclohexene ring**: 2 DoU (1 for the ring, 1 for the double bond).
- **Vinyl group**: 1 DoU (from the double bond).
- **Formyl and COOH groups**: 0 DoU (reduced to CH₂).

Thus, the total **DoU of the product is 3**.

### Step 4: Match with the options
The options provided are:
- A) 1
- B) 3
- C) 5
- D) 0

The correct answer is **B) 3**, as the product retains the cyclohexene ring and vinyl group, each contributing to the DoU, while the formyl and carboxylic acid groups are reduced.
