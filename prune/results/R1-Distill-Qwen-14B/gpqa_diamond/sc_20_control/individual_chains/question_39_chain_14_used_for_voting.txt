Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the value of 'a' in a wave function. Hmm.

Let me read the problem again. We have an ensemble of identical systems, each with a particle that can move along a tube (x-axis). The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Oh wait, and when they measure the position, none are found outside x=1 to x=3. So the particle is confined between x=1 and x=3.

Wait, but wait. The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. That seems a bit strange because typically, a wave function is a complex function, but I thought the real and imaginary parts are related. Hmm, but maybe that's just how it's given. Oh, but wait, in quantum mechanics, the wave function must satisfy certain conditions, like being normalizable. So the integral of the absolute squared must be 1.

But wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i. So that's a complex wave function. So the modulus squared would be (a²/(1+x)) + 0.25 because ( (a / sqrt(1+x)) )^2 is a²/(1+x), and (-0.5i)^2 is (-i)^2*(0.5)^2 = (-1)(0.25) but wait, wait. Wait, when you square a complex number, it's (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b². So let me compute |ψ(x)|² properly.

So ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) ) - 0.5 i. Let me denote A = a / sqrt(1+x), and B = -0.5i. Then ψ = A + B. The modulus squared is |A + B|² = (A + B)(A* + B*), where * is the complex conjugate.

A is real, right? Because a is a real constant, and 1+x is real, so A is real. So A* is A. B is purely imaginary, so B* is 0.5i. So the modulus squared becomes (A + B)(A + B*) = (A + (-0.5i)) (A + 0.5i) ) = A² + A(0.5i) - 0.5i A + ( -0.5i * 0.5i ) ).

Wait, let's compute that. The product is A² + A*(0.5i) + A*(-0.5i) + ( (-0.5i) * (0.5i) ). The middle terms cancel because they are A*(0.5i) - A*(0.5i) = 0. The last term is (-0.5i)(0.5i) = (-0.25)(i^2) = (-0.25)(-1) = 0.25.

So |ψ(x)|² = A² + 0.25 = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

But this is the probability density. For the wave function to be normalizable, the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1. Because the particle is found only between 1 and 3.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

Let me split this into two integrals:

Integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3 + Integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3 = 1.

Compute each part.

First integral: a² ∫ dx/(1+x) from 1 to3. The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x), so evaluating from 1 to3:

a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ] = a² ln(2), since ln(4) is 2 ln2, ln2 subtracted.

Wait, wait. Let me compute it again. ln(1+3) is ln4, and ln(1+1) is ln2. So the difference is ln4 - ln2 = ln(4/2) = ln2. So first integral is a² ln2.

Second integral: 0.25 ∫ dx from 1 to3. That's 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2=0.5.

So the sum is a² ln2 + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln2 = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln2.

Now, compute that numerically. Let me remember that ln2 is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.720. So a² ≈ 0.720, so a ≈ sqrt(0.720). Let's calculate that. sqrt(0.72) is around 0.8485. Hmm, looking at the options: option B is 0.85, which is close.

But wait, let me check my calculations again. Because I might have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So when calculating the modulus squared, I did that correctly. Let me recheck the integral.

The first integral: a² ∫ from 1 to3 of dx/(1+x) = a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln2. Correct.

Second integral: 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5. Correct.

So a² ln2 = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln2 ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.72. So a ≈ sqrt(0.72) ≈ 0.8485. The options have B as 0.85, which is very close. So that must be the answer.

Wait but wait a second. The wave function given isn't normalized yet, right? Because the integral of |ψ|² is 1. So the calculation should give a value for a so that the integral equals 1. Which is exactly what we did. So yes, the correct 'a' is approximately 0.8485, which is option B.

To determine the value of \( a \) in the wave function \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \), we use the normalization condition for wave functions in quantum mechanics. The wave function must satisfy:

\[
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1.
\]

Given that the particle is confined between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), the integral reduces to:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( |\psi(x)|^2 \)
The wave function is \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \). The modulus squared is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left( \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} \right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

### Step 2: Set up the normalization integral
The normalization condition becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left( \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25 \right) dx = 1.
\]

This can be split into two integrals:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx + \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx = 1.
\]

### Step 3: Evaluate the integrals
1. **First integral**:  
   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx = a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx.
   \]
   The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \). Evaluating from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \):
   \[
   a^2 \left[ \ln(4) - \ln(2) \right] = a^2 \ln(2).
   \]

2. **Second integral**:  
   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5.
   \]

### Step 4: Combine the results
Adding the two integrals:
\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Rearranging for \( a^2 \):
\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):
\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.72.
\]

Taking the square root:
\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.72} \approx 0.8485.
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
The closest value to \( 0.8485 \) among the given options is \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to **Option B**.

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the value of 'a' in a wave function. Hmm.

Oh, but wait, in quantum mechanics, the wave function must satisfy certain conditions, like being normalizable. So the integral of the absolute squared must be 1.

But wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i. So that's a complex wave function. So the modulus squared would be (a²/(1+x)) + 0.25 because ( (a / sqrt(1+x)) )^2 is a²/(1+x), and (-0.5i)^2 is (-i)^2*(0.5)^2 = (-1)(0.25) but wait, wait. Wait, when you square a complex number, it's (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b². So let me compute |ψ(x)|² properly.

So ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) ) - 0.5 i. Let me denote A = a / sqrt(1+x), and B = -0.5i. Then ψ = A + B. The modulus squared is |A + B|² = (A + B)(A* + B*), where * is the complex conjugate.

A is real, right? Because a is a real constant, and 1+x is real, so A is real. So A* is A. B is purely imaginary, so B* is 0.5i. So the modulus squared becomes (A + B)(A + B*) = (A + (-0.5i)) (A + 0.5i) ) = A² + A(0.5i) - 0.5i A + ( -0.5i * 0.5i ) ).

So |ψ(x)|² = A² + 0.25 = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

But this is the probability density. For the wave function to be normalizable, the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1. Because the particle is found only between 1 and 3.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

Let me split this into two integrals:

Integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3 + Integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3 = 1.

Compute each part.

First integral: a² ∫ dx/(1+x) from 1 to3. The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x), so evaluating from 1 to3:

a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ] = a² ln(2), since ln(4) is 2 ln2, ln2 subtracted.

Wait, wait. Let me compute it again. ln(1+3) is ln4, and ln(1+1) is ln2. So the difference is ln4 - ln2 = ln(4/2) = ln2. So first integral is a² ln2.

Second integral: 0.25 ∫ dx from 1 to3. That's 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2=0.5.

So the sum is a² ln2 + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln2 = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln2.

Now, compute that numerically. Let me remember that ln2 is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.720. So a² ≈ 0.720, so a ≈ sqrt(0.720). Let's calculate that. sqrt(0.72) is around 0.8485. Hmm, looking at the options: option B is 0.85, which is close.

But wait, let me check my calculations again. Because I might have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So when calculating the modulus squared, I did that correctly. Let me recheck the integral.

The first integral: a² ∫ from 1 to3 of dx/(1+x) = a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln2. Correct.

Second integral: 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5. Correct.

So a² ln2 = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln2 ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.72. So a ≈ sqrt(0.72) ≈ 0.8485. The options have B as 0.85, which is very close. So that must be the answer.

To determine the value of \( a \) in the wave function \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \), we use the normalization condition for wave functions in quantum mechanics. The wave function must satisfy:

\[
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1.
\]

Given that the particle is confined between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), the integral reduces to:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( |\psi(x)|^2 \)
The wave function is \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \). The modulus squared is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left( \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} \right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

### Step 2: Set up the normalization integral
The normalization condition becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left( \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25 \right) dx = 1.
\]

This can be split into two integrals:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx + \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx = 1.
\]

### Step 3: Evaluate the integrals
1. **First integral**:  
   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx = a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx.
   \]
   The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \). Evaluating from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \):
   \[
   a^2 \left[ \ln(4) - \ln(2) \right] = a^2 \ln(2).
   \]

2. **Second integral**:  
   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5.
   \]

### Step 4: Combine the results
Adding the two integrals:
\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Rearranging for \( a^2 \):
\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):
\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.72.
\]

Taking the square root:
\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.72} \approx 0.8485.
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
The closest value to \( 0.8485 \) among the given options is \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to **Option B**.
