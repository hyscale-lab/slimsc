Okay, so I have this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I need to figure out the relationship between the number of stars and the parallax.

Wait, parallax is a measure of distance, right? The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Oh right, the formula is distance (in parsecs) is 1 divided by parallax (in arcseconds). So plx = 1/d, where d is distance.

Now, the stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means that the number density of stars is constant in space. So the number of stars in a certain volume depends on the volume. Because if they're uniformly distributed, the number per unit volume is the same everywhere.

I remember that the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³. Since distance d relates to parallax plx as d = 1/plx, I can express volume in terms of plx.

Wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So, let's think in terms of parallax. Let's say a small change in plx, say dplx. For each plx, what's the corresponding distance?

If plx is p, then distance is d = 1/p. For a small change dp in p, the change in distance is dd = -1/p² dp. Wait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.

I think I need to consider a thin shell between parallax p and p + dp. The volume of this shell would be the surface area of a sphere with radius 1/p multiplied by the thickness, which is the change in radius. Wait, the radius is d = 1/p, so the thickness dr would be the derivative of 1/p with respect to p times dp.

Wait, let's think about it. The radius at parallax p is r = 1/p. So the radius at p + dp is approximately r + dr, where dr = -1/p² dp. The small volume between p and p + dp would be the surface area (4πr²) multiplied by dr.

So, Volume = 4πr² dr. Substituting r = 1/p, dr = (-1/p²) dp. So,

Volume = 4π (1/p²) * (-1/p² dp) )? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Oh wait, dr is positive when p decreases. Because as p increases, the radius decreases. So maybe I should take the absolute value of dr. So dr = (1/p²) dp, but with a negative sign because as p increases, r decreases. But for volume, we take the positive change.

So Volume = 4π (1/p²) * (1/p² dp) )? Wait, no. Let me think differently. The shell between p and p + dp corresponds to a thin spherical shell at radius r = 1/p. The thickness of the shell in radius is dr = (1/(p+dp)) - 1/p ≈ -1/p² dp. Since we're considering a small dp, this is approximately - (1/p²) dp. But the volume is 4π r² dr. Wait, but dr is negative here, so the actual volume is 4π r² |dr|, which is 4π r² (1/p²) dp.

So substituting r = 1/p, we get:

Volume = 4π (1/p²) (1/p²) dp = 4π (1/p^4) dp.

Wait, that seems like a big exponent. So Volume is proportional to 1/p^4 times dp.

But wait, the number of stars in that volume would be the volume multiplied by the number density, which is uniform. So if the number density is n stars per unit volume, then the number of stars dN in that shell is n * Volume = n * 4π (1/p^4) dp.

So the number of stars per unit range of parallax (dN/dp) would be proportional to 1/p^4.

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So the rate at which the number of stars changes with plx is inversely proportional to p^4.

So looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4. Option D is 1/plx^3. Hmm, did I make a mistake in my calculation?

Wait, let me double-check. Alternative approach: the number of stars in a shell between plx p and p + dp. The volume is 4π r² dr, with r = 1/p. dr is the change in radius, so dr = d(1/p) = -1/p² dp. The volume is 4π (1/p)^2 (1/p²) dp, which is 4π/p^4 dp. So yeah, the volume is proportional to 1/p^4. Multiply by n, the density, so the number of stars is proportional to 1/p^4.

So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/p^4. So the correct answer should be option A.

Wait wait, but another way to think about it: the volume element in terms of distance. Let's say we have a shell from d to d + dd. The volume is 4π d² dd. Since d = 1/p, then dd = (-1/p²) dp. So Volume is 4π ( (1/p)^2 ) ( -1/p² dp ) ) → 4π (1/p^4)(-dp). But since we take the positive, it's 4π (1/p^4) dp.

So same result. So the number of stars in a shell is proportional to 1/p^4. So the number per unit plx (dp) is proportional to 1/p^4. So the number per unit plx (dN/dp) is proportional to 1/p^4.

So the answer should be A) ~1/plx^4.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the number of stars in a given volume would be n * Volume, so if the volume is 1/p^4, then the number is proportional to that. So yeah, that's correct.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax (plx) is inversely related to distance (d): \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \). If stars are uniformly distributed, the number density of stars is constant, meaning the number of stars in a given volume depends on the volume itself.

Consider a thin spherical shell at parallax \( p \), corresponding to a distance \( d = \frac{1}{p} \). The volume of this shell is given by \( 4\pi r^2 \, dr \), where \( r = \frac{1}{p} \) is the radius of the shell and \( dr \) is the thickness of the shell. Since \( dr = \frac{d}{dp} \left( \frac{1}{p} \right) = -\frac{1}{p^2} dp \), the absolute volume of the shell is:

\[
\text{Volume} = 4\pi \left( \frac{1}{p^2} \right) \left( \frac{1}{p^2} dp \right) = \frac{4\pi}{p^4} dp.
\]

The number of stars in this shell is proportional to the volume, as the number density of stars is constant. Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (dN/dp) is proportional to:

\[
\frac{dN}{dp} \propto \frac{1}{p^4}.
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{p^4} \). Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A) ~1/plx^4.**
