Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. Oh wait, I remember that the potential is V(r) = (1/2)mω²r². Yeah, right, that's the Hooke's law kind of potential, like a 3D version of a harmonic oscillator.

The question is asking about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy. Hmm, I think I need to figure out what the energy levels look like in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator.

Wait, in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are quantized. Each energy level depends on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Since it's isotropic, the potential is the same in x, y, and z directions. Oh right, the energy levels are given by E = ħω(n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2), where n_x, n_y, n_z are non-negative integers. Alternatively, I've heard it expressed as E = ħω(n + 3/2), where n is the total quantum number, which is n = n_x + n_y + n_z.

Wait, no, wait. For a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, each direction contributes a quantum number. So the total energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers plus three halves. So E = ħω (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) = ħω (n + 3/2), where n = n_x + n_y + n_z.

But the problem is about the third excited state. Oh, wait, in quantum mechanics, the ground state is the lowest energy, so the first excited state is the next one, then the second, etc. So the third excited state would be the fourth level, right?

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The ground state is n=0 (n_x=0, n_y=0, n_z=0). The first excited state would have the lowest possible n, which is n=1. Because n is the sum of the three quantum numbers, so the first excited state is the one with n=1. The second would be n=2, third excited would be n=3.

Wait, no, no, wait: for a 3D oscillator, each energy level is corresponding to a certain n, and each n can be degenerate. So the energy is E = (n + 3/2) ħω. So n is the sum of the three quantum numbers. The ground state is n=0, so E= (0 +3/2) ħω = 3/2 ħω. Then the first excited state would be n=1, energy 5/2 ħω. Second excited is n=2, energy 7/2 ħω. Third excited is n=3, energy (3 +3/2)=9/2 ħω. So the energy for the third excited state is (9/2) ħω. That matches option A's first part, which is (9/2) hbar omega.

Now, how many eigenfunctions are there for the same energy eigenvalue? That is, the degeneracy of the energy level when n=3.

In 3D harmonic oscillator, the number of states (the degeneracy) for a given n is (n + 1)(n +2)/2. Wait, is that right? Or is it something else. Wait, I think it's the number of ways to partition n into three non-negative integers n_x, n_y, n_z. So the number of distinct triplets (n_x, n_y, n_z) such that n_x +n_y +n_z = n. This is a problem of combinations with repetition, so the formula is (n +3 -1 choose 3 -1) ) = (n +2 choose 2) ). So that's (n+2)(n+1)/2. So for n=3, that would be (3+2)(3+1)/2 = 5*4/2=10. So the degeneracy is 10. So that's the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy.

Looking back at the options:

Option A is (9/2) hbar omega, 10. That matches. So the correct answer is A.

Wait, let me check the other options quickly. Option B has a different energy expression, involving pi squared and r squared in denominator, but the potential is harmonic, so the energy shouldn't depend on r. So B and D can be dismissed because they have wrong energy expressions. Option C's degeneracy is 3, which is way too low for n=3. So definitely, A is correct.

The problem involves a quantum mechanical system of a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, \( V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2 \). The energy levels for such a system are given by:

\[
E = \hbar \omega \left( n_x + n_y + n_z + \frac{3}{2} \right),
\]

where \( n_x, n_y, n_z \) are non-negative integers representing the quantum numbers in each spatial direction. The total quantum number is \( n = n_x + n_y + n_z \), and the energy can also be expressed as:

\[
E = \hbar \omega \left( n + \frac{3}{2} \right).
\]

The ground state corresponds to \( n = 0 \), the first excited state to \( n = 1 \), the second excited state to \( n = 2 \), and the third excited state to \( n = 3 \). For \( n = 3 \), the energy is:

\[
E = \hbar \omega \left( 3 + \frac{3}{2} \right) = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega.
\]

The degeneracy of a given energy level in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is determined by the number of ways to partition \( n \) into three non-negative integers \( n_x, n_y, n_z \). This is given by the combinatorial formula:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \binom{n + 2}{2} = \frac{(n + 2)(n + 1)}{2}.
\]

For \( n = 3 \), the degeneracy is:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \frac{(3 + 2)(3 + 1)}{2} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2} = 10.
\]

Thus, the energy of the third excited state is \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega \), and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to this energy eigenvalue.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega, 10 \) matches both the energy and the degeneracy.
- **Option B**: The energy expression involves \( \pi^2 \) and \( r^2 \), which is incorrect for a harmonic oscillator.
- **Option C**: The degeneracy is listed as 3, which is too low for \( n = 3 \).
- **Option D**: Similar to Option B, the energy expression is incorrect.

The correct answer is **A**.
