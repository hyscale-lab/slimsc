Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon, where all the apothems are of length 'a'. Monochromatic light (wavelength λ) is shining along the z-axis, and we're looking at the far-field intensity pattern. The problem asks for the angular distance between the first two minima when N approaches infinity. The approximation tanθ ≈ θ is given because the angles are small.

Hmm. I remember that when light passes through an aperture, it creates a diffraction pattern. For a single slit, the minima occur at certain angles based on the formula. But this is a polygon with many sides, and when N is infinitely large, it becomes like a circle with lots of sides, right?

Wait, so when N is very large, the polygon's shape approaches a circle. So maybe this problem is similar to the single-slit diffraction but for a circular aperture, which would have a central maximum and then minima at certain angles.

Wait, no. Wait, for a single slit, the minima are at angles where a sinθ = mλ, where m is an integer. The first minimum is at θ where sinθ = λ/(a), right? But that's for a single slit.

But here, the question is about a polygon. Oh, but when N is infinite, it's a circular aperture. So maybe this is about the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture, which I think is different from the single slit.

Wait, the single-slit diffraction gives a pattern with the central maximum and then minima at sinθ = mλ/a. But a circular aperture (like a pinhole) produces an Airy disk, where the first minimum is at a certain angle, but I'm not exactly sure about the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not about a circular aperture, but about a polygon with very high N, which in some ways approximates a rectangular or slit-like shape. Wait, but the problem says N is infinitely large. Hmm.

Wait, the aperture is an N-sided polygon. All apothems are length a. The apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So for a regular polygon, the apothem 'a' is related to the side length and the number of sides.

But when N is very large, the polygon becomes a circle. Wait, but the apothem 'a' would be the radius of that circle. So the radius R is equal to 'a' in this case.

So the aperture is a circle of radius a. So when the light passes through this circular aperture, the far-field diffraction pattern is the Airy disk. The first minimum in the Airy disk occurs at a certain angle.

I remember that the minima in the Airy disk occur at angles where the Bessel function J1 has zeros. The first minimum is at θ where J1(k a sinθ) = 0. The zeros of J1 are at values where the argument is approximately 3.8317 for the first zero. Wait, wait, the first minimum is when J1 reaches zero for the first time.

Wait, the formula for the minima in the Airy disk is given by:

a sinθ = p * λ / (2π), where p is the order of the zero of the Bessel function. The first minimum is for p=1, so sinθ = (λ)/(2π a) * (something? Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the condition for the minima in the Airy pattern is that the phase shift causes destructive interference. The formula is given by the zeros of the Bessel functions. For the m-th minimum, the condition is:

a sinθ = (x_m,n) λ / (2π)

where x_m,n is the n-th zero of the Bessel function J_m. For the first minimum in the Airy pattern (the outermost minimum in the diffraction pattern), m is 1 and n is 1. The first zero of J1 is at approximately 3.8317.

So plugging that in:

sinθ = (3.8317 λ) / (2π a)

Wait, but wait, the approximation tanθ ≈ θ is given because the angles are small, so θ is approximately equal to sinθ. So θ ≈ (3.8317 λ)/(2π a)

But wait, the first minimum is the outermost one, but perhaps another way. Or maybe I'm mixing up the formula. Alternatively, I think the first minimum is at θ where a sinθ = 1.220 λ, which is the formula from the single-slit diffraction. Wait no, that's for the single slit. For a circular aperture, the first minimum is at 1.22 λ/(2a), because the formula is (λ / (π a)) * x_mn, where x is the zero. Wait, I might be getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. For a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern's first minimum occurs at an angle θ where sinθ ≈ 1.22 λ/(π a). Because x_1,1 is approximately 3.8317, and 3.8317/(2π) is about 0.610, so 3.8317/(2π) ≈ 0.610. So then:

sinθ = (x_1,1 * λ)/(2π a) = (3.8317 λ) / (2π a) ≈ (0.610 λ)/a.

Wait, that would make the angle θ ≈ (0.610 λ)/a. Because when angles are small, sinθ ≈ θ.

But the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. Wait, but for a circular aperture, the first minimum is the only minimum, or are there more? Or wait, no, the Airy disk has a central bright spot and then rings of decreasing intensity. The first minimum is the edge of the central spot, and the next minima are in the rings. Wait, no, perhaps the first minimum is the first dark ring. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let's think about the single-slit diffraction. The minima are at a sinθ = mλ, m=1,2,3,... So the first minimum is at θ = λ/(a), second at 2λ/(a), etc. But the angular distance between the first two minima would be (2λ/(a) - λ/(a)) = λ/(a). But that's for the single slit.

But the question is about a polygon with N sides, but N is infinite, so it's a circle. So perhaps the first minimum is at θ = 1.22 λ/(a), which is the first minimum for a circular aperture. But wait, the options don't have 1.22 in the angular distance. Wait, the options have 0.610, 0.500, 1.220, 0.506.

Wait, the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. Hmm. So perhaps, for a circular aperture, the first minimum after the central maximum is at θ1 = (x_11 * λ)/(pi a), and the next minimum is at θ2 = (x_12 * λ)/(pi a). But wait, the Bessel functions have zeros in order for each m. For m=1, the first zero is at ~3.8317, the second is at ~7.0156, the third at ~10.1735, etc. So the first minimum is at θ1 ≈ (3.8317 λ)/(2 pi a) ≈ 0.610 λ/(a). The next minimum for m=1 (the same order) would be at θ2≈ (7.0156 λ)/(2 pi a) ≈ (7.0156)/(6.2832) ≈ ~1.116 λ/(a). So the angular distance between the first and second minima would be θ2 - θ1 ≈ 1.116 - 0.610 = 0.506 λ/a.

Wait, that matches option D: 0.506 λ/a.

Wait, but alternatively, perhaps the problem is not considering m=1 for the second minimum but another m. Hmm, perhaps the first minimum is m=1, the next is m=1 again but higher order zero.

Alternatively, perhaps the first minimum is at θ1 = 1.220 λ/a (which is 2*0.610), but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture. The intensity pattern involves a central spot, and the first dark ring is the first minimum. The angular position of this is given by sinθ = 1.22 λ/(π a). Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the terms.

Wait, the formula for the minima in the Airy pattern is given by:

a sinθ = (x_{m,n}) * λ/(2π),

where x_{m,n} is the n-th zero of the Bessel function J_m.

For the first minimum (m=1, n=1), x_{1,1} is approximately 3.8317. So:

sinθ1 = (3.8317 * λ) / (2 π a) ≈ (3.8317)/(6.2832) * (λ/a) ≈ 0.610 λ/a.

So θ1 ≈ 0.610 λ/a.

The next minima would be for n=2, same m=1. x_{1,2} is approximately 7.0156. So sinθ2 = (7.0156 λ)/(2 π a) ≈ (7.0156)/(6.2832) λ/a ≈ 1.116 λ/a.

So the angular distance between the first two minima would be θ2 - θ1 ≈ (1.116 - 0.610) λ/a ≈ 0.506 λ/a, which is option D.

So the answer would be D) 0.506 λ/a.

The problem involves a monochromatic light of wavelength $\lambda$ shining through an aperture shaped like an $N$-sided polygon, where all apothems are of length $a$. When $N$ is infinitely large, the aperture approximates a circle of radius $a$. The task is to determine the angular distance between the first two minima in the far-field diffraction pattern, assuming small angles where $\tan\theta \approx \theta$.

For a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern is described by the Airy disk, where the minima occur at angles determined by the zeros of the Bessel function $J_1$. The condition for the $n$-th minimum is:

\[
a \sin\theta = \frac{x_{1,n} \lambda}{2\pi},
\]

where $x_{1,n}$ is the $n$-th zero of $J_1$. The first two zeros of $J_1$ are approximately $x_{1,1} \approx 3.8317$ and $x_{1,2} \approx 7.0156$. Using these values:

1. For the first minimum ($n=1$):
   \[
   \sin\theta_1 = \frac{x_{1,1} \lambda}{2\pi a} = \frac{3.8317 \lambda}{2\pi a} \approx 0.610 \frac{\lambda}{a}.
   \]
   Since $\theta_1 \approx \sin\theta_1$ for small angles, $\theta_1 \approx 0.610 \frac{\lambda}{a}$.

2. For the second minimum ($n=2$):
   \[
   \sin\theta_2 = \frac{x_{1,2} \lambda}{2\pi a} = \frac{7.0156 \lambda}{2\pi a} \approx 1.116 \frac{\lambda}{a}.
   \]
   Similarly, $\theta_2 \approx \sin\theta_2$, so $\theta_2 \approx 1.116 \frac{\lambda}{a}$.

The angular distance between the first two minima is:
\[
\Delta\theta = \theta_2 - \theta_1 \approx 1.116 \frac{\lambda}{a} - 0.610 \frac{\lambda}{a} = 0.506 \frac{\lambda}{a}.
\]

Thus, the angular distance between the first two minima is approximately $0.506 \frac{\lambda}{a}$.
