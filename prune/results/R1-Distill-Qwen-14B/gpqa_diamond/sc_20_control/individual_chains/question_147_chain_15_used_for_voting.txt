Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says: Consider the annihilation process p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of A is given as m_A c² = 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A. The options are A) 0.77c, B) 0.96c, C) 0.91c, D) 0.86c.

Hmm, alright. Let's think about what this process entails. Annihilation usually refers to a particle and its antiparticle annihilating each other and converting their mass into energy, typically in the form of other particles. But in this case, the products are two A⁺ and two A⁻ particles. So, maybe the initial particles are a proton and antiproton, which annihilate into these charged A particles.

Wait, the initial particles are a proton (p) and antiproton (p̄). Each has the same mass as the proton, right? So the system's initial energy comes from the rest mass of the proton and antiproton, plus any kinetic energy they have. But the question says the antiproton is moving slowly. Oh, so maybe its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. Or perhaps we can approximate that the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving very slowly? Hmm, but that's not necessarily the case. Alternatively, perhaps the initial velocities are such that we can consider the antiproton's speed is low, so maybe we can approximate some terms.

Wait, the problem states the antiproton is slowly moving. So, its speed is much less than c, so maybe we can make the non-relativistic approximation for it. But the product particles, A⁺ and A⁻, might have relativistic speeds, so we can't ignore relativity for them.

So, let's think about conservation laws. In any interaction, both energy and momentum are conserved. Since the process is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻, we need to ensure that total energy and momentum are conserved.

Let me write down the initial and final states.

Initial state:
- A proton (p), which has rest mass m_p c² ≈ 938 MeV (I remember that the proton rest energy is about 938 MeV, but the problem gives m_A c² as 300 MeV, so perhaps the mass of A is smaller than the proton. Wait, but the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe we can model it as a non-relativistic system.)

Wait, wait. Wait a second. The initial particles are p and p̄. The rest mass of each is m_p c², which is about 938 MeV, but the problem gives m_A c² = 300 MeV. So the A particles have a rest mass of 300 MeV each. Hmm, that's about a third of the proton's mass. So, the A particles are lighter than protons.

But regardless, let's proceed.

The antiproton is moving slowly, so let's assume that its kinetic energy is much less than its rest energy. So, perhaps we can approximate its velocity as non-relativistic, and use non-relativistic expressions for its energy and momentum.

But wait, the proton might not be at rest. The initial state is a proton and an antiproton moving towards each other, right? Or perhaps one is at rest, but I'm not sure. The question says the antiproton is moving slowly, but it doesn't specify the proton's state. Hmm, perhaps in this scenario, the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly towards it.

Wait, but in the center-of-momentum frame, the initial momentum would be zero if both particles are approaching each other with equal and opposite momenta. But if the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the initial momentum is dominated by the antiproton's movement, assuming the proton is at rest. Alternatively, maybe the initial frame is the lab frame where the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with a low velocity.

But the problem statement isn't entirely clear. Let's try to proceed.

In the initial state, let's assume that the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with a slow velocity v. Since it's moving slowly, we can approximate its energy as E_p̄ ≈ m_p c² (rest energy) plus a small kinetic energy. But since it's moving, its total energy would be higher than its rest energy. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering a scenario where the initial kinetic energy is small, so the total energy is approximately 2 m_p c², but perhaps not.

Wait, the initial system's total energy is the sum of the proton's and antiproton's energies. If the proton is at rest, its energy is m_p c², and the antiproton, moving slowly, has energy E = γ m_p c², where γ is approximately 1 + (v²)/(2c²) for small v.

But maybe I should think in terms of conservation of four-momentum. The four-momentum before annihilation is the sum of the four-momenta of the proton and antiproton. The four-momentum after annihilation is the sum of the four-momenta of the four A particles. But since the problem is symmetric, perhaps the A particles are produced in pairs, each with the same velocity. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, let's think about the problem more carefully.

The initial particles are a proton (p) and an antiproton (p̄). The proton is at rest (I think), and the antiproton is moving slowly. So, their four-momenta are:

For the proton: Since it's at rest, its four-momentum is (E_p, 0,0,0), where E_p = m_p c².

For the antiproton: Since it's moving with a small velocity v, its four-momentum is (γ m_p c², γ m_p v, 0, 0), where γ = 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2 c²) for small v.

So the total four-momentum before annihilation is:

E_total_initial = E_p + E_p̄ = m_p c² + γ m_p c².

p_initial = γ m_p v, along the x-axis.

Hmm, but wait, the initial momentum is only from the antiproton because the proton is at rest. So the initial momentum is in the direction of the antiproton's motion.

In the final state, the products are four A particles: 2 A⁺ and 2 A⁻. Since the reaction is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻, perhaps the A particles are produced symmetrically, each moving in opposite directions to conserve momentum.

But perhaps it's better to model the final state as two pairs of A particles: perhaps each A⁺ and A⁻ are moving in opposite directions, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the final state has two pairs with the same velocity but opposite directions, leading to a net momentum of zero. But that wouldn't make sense because the initial momentum is non-zero.

Wait, but the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly, so perhaps the initial momentum is small. So the final state must have a net momentum equal to the initial momentum, which is small. Therefore, the A particles must have some momentum that sums up to that small initial momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps the A particles are moving in such a way that their momenta add up to the initial momentum.

But this could get complicated with four particles. Maybe the problem assumes that each A particle has the same velocity, but that's not necessarily the case. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is symmetric, and the particles come out in pairs with equal and opposite momenta, but then the net momentum would be zero. But that can't be the case if the initial momentum isn't zero.

Wait, perhaps the problem is symmetric, and the two A⁺ and two A⁻ are emitted in such a way that their momenta sum up to the initial momentum. Alternatively, perhaps each A particle has the same speed, but opposite directions, but that would make the total momentum zero if emitted symmetrically. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, let me think. Since the problem gives a single velocity for the A particles, perhaps they all have the same velocity magnitude. But that might not be correct, but perhaps the problem is suggesting that each A particle has the same speed, and maybe they're all moving in the same direction, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the scenario where the initial momentum is negligible, so the final particles have zero net momentum. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as a reaction where the initial momentum is small, so the final particles must have a non-zero net momentum that's small, but this could complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is utilizing the fact that the initial kinetic energy is small, so the resulting particles have most of their energy in rest mass, but perhaps moving with a certain relativistic speed. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the process is in the rest frame of the combined system, but the initial system's velocity is low.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to use conservation of energy and momentum in the lab frame where the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with a small velocity.

But let's proceed step by step.

First, let's model the initial four-momentum.

Proton at rest: four-momentum (m_p c², 0, 0, 0).

Antiproton moving slowly: four-momentum (E_p̄, p_p̄, 0, 0), where E_p̄ = γ m_p c², and p_p̄ = γ m_p v. Since v is small, γ ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2 c²), and p_p̄ ≈ m_p v (non-relativistic approximation).

So the total initial four-momentum is:

E_initial = m_p c² + γ m_p c² ≈ m_p c² (1 + γ) ≈ m_p c² (2 + (v²)/(2 c²)) ).

p_initial = γ m_p v ≈ m_p v (since γ ≈1).

Now, the final four-momentum is the sum of the four-momenta of the four A particles. Let's denote each A particle's four-momentum as (E_A, p_A), but considering that there are four particles, perhaps two A⁺ and two A⁻, each with the same speed, but maybe opposite directions.

Wait, but that's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps all four A particles are moving in the same direction, but that would make the total momentum large. Alternatively, maybe each pair (A⁺ and A⁻) are moving in opposite directions, but then with two such pairs, the total momentum could be more manageable.

Wait, perhaps the A particles are moving in a way that their momenta add up to the initial momentum. Since the initial momentum is small (because the antiproton is moving slowly), the sum of the A particles' momenta must be small.

Alternatively, perhaps each A particle has a momentum p_A, but let's think about four particles each moving in such a way that their momenta sum up to p_initial.

But this seems complicated, so perhaps I should make some simplifying assumptions. For instance, perhaps each A particle has the same momentum magnitude, and they are moving in such a way that their momenta add up to the initial momentum.

But considering that there are four A particles, maybe two of them are moving in the positive x-direction and two in the negative, but with their momenta arranged to sum to the initial momentum p_initial.

Alternatively, perhaps each A particle is moving with the same speed and direction, but that would make the total momentum larger.

Wait, perhaps the A particles are moving in pairs, such that each pair has opposite momenta, but since there are two pairs, the total could sum to something non-zero. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is symmetric, and the momentum of each A is balanced so that the total momentum is the same as the initial.

Another approach: let's consider that after annihilation, four A particles are produced. Let's assume that each A has the same speed v. Since the problem asks for the velocity of particle A, perhaps all A particles have the same speed, so we can model them this way.

But wait, the problem states that the annihilation produces 2 A⁺ and 2 A⁻. So perhaps each pair (A⁺ and A⁻) is moving in opposite directions, but perhaps each pair shares the same velocity magnitude but opposite directions. So for each pair, their momenta would cancel each other, but considering two such pairs, maybe the total momentum is zero. But that can't be, because the initial momentum is not zero (the antiproton is moving). So that scenario would violate momentum conservation.

Hmm, perhaps I should instead model the problem in the center-of-momentum frame, but since the antiproton is moving slowly, the initial frame is the lab frame where the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving with low velocity.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be approached using the conservation of energy and momentum in the lab frame where the proton is at rest.

So, in the lab frame:

Initial energy: E_initial = m_p c² (proton at rest) + γ m_p c² (antiproton moving).

Initial momentum: p_initial = γ m_p v (antiproton's momentum).

Final energy: E_final = 4 * E_A, since there are four A particles, each with energy E_A.

Final momentum: p_final = 4 * p_A, but wait, only if all A are moving in the same direction. But that's probably not the case. Alternatively, perhaps two are moving in one direction and two in the opposite, leading to a net momentum of 2 (p_A) - 2 (p_A) = 0. But that can't be, because the initial momentum isn't zero.

Wait, no, because in reality, the four A particles may have a distribution of momenta. Alternatively, perhaps each A has momentum p_A, and the momenta vectors add up to the initial momentum p_initial.

But this is getting a bit too vague. Perhaps instead, I should make the assumption that each A particle has the same speed v, and their momenta are arranged such that the vector sum equals the initial momentum. But I don't know the directions, so this could get complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem approximates that all four A particles are moving in the same direction, so their momenta add up. But that would make their total momentum 4 p_A, which must equal the initial p_initial.

So, let's proceed with that assumption. So, assuming all four A particles are moving in the same direction as the initial momentum.

So, for each A, energy E_A = γ_A m_A c².

Momentum p_A = γ_A m_A v_A, where v_A is the speed of the A particles.

So, from momentum conservation:

4 p_A = p_initial.

From energy conservation:

4 E_A = E_initial.

So, substituting:

4 γ_A m_A v_A = γ m_p v.

And 4 γ_A m_A c² = m_p c² + γ m_p c².

Hmm, but this seems a bit too simplistic. Let's write the equations.

Let me denote γ_A as the Lorentz factor for the A particles, and v_A as their speed.

Then:

Momentum equation: 4 γ_A m_A v_A = γ m_p v.

Energy equation: 4 γ_A m_A c² = m_p c² (1 + γ) → since E_initial = m_p c² + γ m_p c².

We can write the energy equation as:

4 γ_A m_A c² = m_p c² (1 + γ).

But since the antiproton is moving slowly, v is small. So γ ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2 c²), and since v is small, say << c, then γ ≈ 1.

Therefore, the energy equation becomes approximately:

4 γ_A m_A c² = m_p c² (1 + 1) ) → 4 γ_A m_A c² = 2 m_p c².

Dividing both sides by c²:

4 γ_A m_A = 2 m_p → γ_A = (2 m_p) / (4 m_A) ) = (m_p) / (2 m_A).

Given that m_A c² = 300 MeV → m_A = 300 MeV/c².

The proton's mass is m_p c² = 938 MeV, so m_p = 938 MeV/c².

So, substituting:

γ_A = (938 MeV/c²) / (2 * 300 MeV/c²) ) = 938/(600) ≈ 1.5633.

So γ_A ≈ 1.5633.

Now, γ_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - v_A²/c²) → so 1.5633 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v_A²/c²).

Solving for v_A:

sqrt(1 - v_A²/c²) = 1/1.5633 ≈ 0.640.

Squaring both sides: 1 - v_A²/c² ≈ 0.410.

So, v_A²/c² ≈ 1 - 0.410 = 0.59 → v_A ≈ sqrt(0.59) c ≈ 0.768 c.

Wait, that's about 0.768c. But looking at the options, option A is 0.77c, which is very close. So that would suggest option A is correct.

Wait, but let's double-check the equations because I might have made some wrong assumptions.

Wait, in the momentum equation, I assumed all four A particles are moving in the same direction, which might not be the case. If they have different directions, the net momentum could be less.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption about the momentum being entirely carried by the A particles moving in the same direction isn't correct, but given that the initial momentum is small (since the antiproton is moving slowly), and the A particles are produced in a symmetric way, perhaps their momenta are arranged such that the net momentum is equal to the initial.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to be solved with the assumption that the total momentum is conserved in the initial and final states, and the energy is as well.

Wait, but let's think again. Since the A particles are all moving, perhaps their individual momenta sum to the initial momentum, which is γ m_p v. So, perhaps if all four are moving in the same direction, the sum is 4 γ_A m_A v_A = γ m_p v.

But in the non-relativistic case, v_A would be much lower than c, but since the problem gives m_A as 300 MeV, which is about a third of the proton mass, the A particles would be moving at a significant fraction of c, so relativistic effects matter.

But when I calculated γ_A as approximately 1.563, which gives v_A ≈ 0.77c, which matches option A, but looking back, I also need to consider the other equation.

Wait, let me write the two equations again:

1) 4 γ_A m_A v_A = γ m_p v.

2) 4 γ_A m_A c^2 = m_p c^2 (1 + γ).

We can solve these two equations for γ and v.

But let me try to find the ratio between the two equations.

Dividing equation 1 by equation 2:

[4 γ_A m_A v_A] / [4 γ_A m_A c² * (1 + γ)] = [γ m_p v] / [m_p c² (1 + γ)].

Simplify left side: (v_A) / (c² (1 + γ)).

Right side: (γ v) / (c² (1 + γ)).

Wait, but both sides have (1 + γ) and (c²), so they cancel out.

So, v_A / c² = γ v / c² → v_A = γ v.

Hmm, that's an interesting relation. So, v_A = γ v.

But wait, from equation 2, we had:

4 γ_A m_A c^2 = m_p c^2 (1 + γ).

But m_p is 938 MeV/c², m_A is 300 MeV/c².

So, 4 γ_A * 300 = 938 (1 + γ) → 1200 γ_A = 938 (1 + γ).

But from equation 1, 4 γ_A m_A v_A = γ m_p v.

Since v_A = γ v, substitute that into equation 1:

4 γ_A * 300 * (γ v) = γ * 938 * v.

Wait, but v is a variable here. Let's see:

Left side: 4 * 300 * γ_A * γ v = 1200 γ_A γ v.

Right side: 938 γ v.

So, 1200 γ_A γ v = 938 γ v.

We can cancel γ v from both sides (assuming v not zero, which it isn't).

So, 1200 γ_A = 938 → γ_A = 938 / 1200 ≈ 0.7817.

Wait, but earlier I found γ_A ≈ 1.563. Now it's giving me γ_A ≈ 0.7817. That's a contradiction, which suggests I made a mistake in my approach.

Hmm, perhaps I made a wrong assumption in the way the momenta add up.

Let me retrace. I assumed that all four A particles are moving in the same direction, so their momenta sum up to 4 p_A. But perhaps in reality, each A has a different momentum vector, making the total momentum the same as the initial, but it's unclear without more information.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the two A⁺ and two A⁻ are emitted in such a way that their momenta sum up to the initial momentum. But without knowing the angles, it's challenging.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved in the center-of-momentum frame, but given that the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe the initial momentum is small, so the frame is approximately the lab frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using the conservation of energy and momentum with the assumption that the final particles are moving at the same speed, but perhaps not all in the same direction.

Wait, perhaps another approach: Since the initial system's total energy is E_initial = m_p c² + γ m_p c², and the total momentum is p_initial = γ m_p v.

In the final state, each A has energy E_A = γ_A m_A c² and momentum p_A = γ_A m_A v_A.

Assuming that the four A particles are moving in such a way that their momenta vectors sum up to p_initial. But without knowing the angles, this is difficult. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that all A particles are moving along the same line, so momentum can be treated as scalar.

But then their momenta would add up, so 4 p_A = p_initial.

But then, we have two equations:

1) 4 γ_A m_A v_A = γ m_p v.

2) 4 γ_A m_A c² = m_p c² (1 + γ).

But when I tried substituting, I ended up with conflicting values for γ_A. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I should write the ratio of the two equations.

From equation 1: 4 γ_A m_A v_A = γ m_p v.

From equation 2: 4 γ_A m_A c² = (1 + γ) m_p c².

Divide equation 1 by equation 2:

[4 γ_A m_A v_A ] / [4 γ_A m_A c² ] = [γ m_p v ] / [ (1 + γ) m_p c² ].

Simplify left side: (v_A) / (c²).

Right side: [ γ v ] / [ (1 + γ) c² ].

Multiply both sides by c²:

v_A = [ γ v (1 + γ) ] / (1 + γ) ) ? Wait, no.

Wait, the right side is [ γ v ] / (1 + γ ).

So:

v_A = [ γ v ] / (1 + γ ).

Hmm, but this is a relation between v_A and v.

But I don't know v or γ. So perhaps I need another equation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write γ in terms of v.

γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

But since v is small (antiproton is moving slowly), γ ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2 c²).

So, let's make that approximation.

Then, equation 2 becomes:

4 γ_A m_A c² = m_p c² (1 + 1 + (v²)/(2 c²) ) → 4 γ_A m_A c² = m_p c² (2 + (v²)/(2 c²) )

Divide both sides by c²:

4 γ_A m_A = m_p (2 + (v²)/(2 c²) )

But m_p is about 3 m_A (since 938 ≈ 3 * 300), so 4 γ_A m_A ≈ 3 m_A (2 + (v²)/(2 c²) )

Divide both sides by m_A:

4 γ_A = 3 (2 + (v²)/(2 c²) )

→ γ_A = (3/4) * (2 + (v²)/(2 c²) )

Similarly, from equation 1, using the approximation v_A = γ v.

So, v_A = γ v → v = v_A / γ.

Substituting into the equation:

4 γ_A m_A v_A ≈ γ m_p (v_A / γ).

Wait, let's write equation 1 again.

Equation 1: 4 γ_A m_A v_A = γ m_p v.

But since v is small, and assuming v ≈ v_A / γ, because v_A = γ v → v = v_A / γ.

So substituting v = v_A / γ into equation 1:

4 γ_A m_A v_A = γ m_p (v_A / γ )

Simplify:

4 γ_A m_A v_A = m_p v_A.

Divide both sides by v_A (assuming v_A ≠ 0):

4 γ_A m_A = m_p.

But wait, m_p is 938 MeV/c², and m_A is 300 MeV/c².

So, 4 γ_A * 300 = 938 → 4 * 300 * γ_A = 938 → 1200 γ_A = 938 → γ_A = 938 / 1200 ≈ 0.7817.

Wait, but earlier in the other approach, I had γ_A ≈1.563, which gives v_A ≈0.77c.

This is conflicting, so perhaps my approximations are leading me astray.

Wait, perhaps this approach is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps I should not make the assumption that v is small but instead consider that the antiproton has a non-negligible velocity, but the A particles are moving at a significant fraction of c.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the initial momentum is not negligible, so the A particles must have a net momentum equal to the initial momentum.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try another approach, using the conservation of energy and momentum in the center-of-momentum frame.

Wait, but if I shift to the center-of-momentum frame, the initial total momentum is zero, so the final state must also have zero total momentum.

So in that frame, the four A particles must have momenta that sum to zero.

But perhaps the problem is symmetric, so each A particle has equal and opposite momenta. But with four particles, perhaps two A⁺ and two A⁻ are emitted in opposite directions, leading to a symmetric distribution.

But this might not directly help because the problem is about the velocity of the A particles in the lab frame where the antiproton is moving slowly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the velocity of the A particles in the center-of-momentum frame and then transform back to the lab frame. But that might complicate things.

Wait, another approach: The problem gives m_A c² = 300 MeV. Let's compute the ratio of masses.

m_p c² = 938 MeV, m_A c² = 300 MeV. So m_p ≈ 3.127 m_A.

Now, the initial system is a proton (at rest) and an antiproton moving with velocity v. The total energy is E_initial = m_p c² + γ m_p c² = m_p c² (1 + γ).

The total momentum is p_initial = γ m_p v.

In the final state, the four A particles must have total energy E_final = 4 γ_A m_A c².

Total momentum p_final = 4 γ_A m_A v_A (assuming all move in the same direction, but this is an assumption).

Conservation of momentum: 4 γ_A m_A v_A = γ m_p v.

Conservation of energy: 4 γ_A m_A c² = m_p c² (1 + γ).

Let me write these equations.

Equation 1: 4 γ_A m_A v_A = γ m_p v.

Equation 2: 4 γ_A m_A = m_p (1 + γ).

But given that m_p = (938/300) m_A ≈ 3.127 m_A.

So, equation 2 becomes: 4 γ_A m_A = 3.127 m_A (1 + γ).

Divide both sides by m_A:

4 γ_A = 3.127 (1 + γ) → equation 2a.

Equation 1: 4 γ_A m_A v_A = γ (3.127 m_A) v.

Divide both sides by m_A:

4 γ_A v_A = 3.127 γ v → equation 1a.

Now, from equation 2a:

γ_A = [3.127 (1 + γ)] / 4.

And from equation 1a:

v_A = [3.127 γ v ] / (4 γ_A).

Substituting γ_A from equation 2a into equation 1a:

v_A = [3.127 γ v ] / [4 * (3.127 (1 + γ)) /4 ) ]

Simplify denominator: 4 * (3.127 (1 + γ )) /4 → 3.127 (1 + γ )

So, v_A = [3.127 γ v ] / [3.127 (1 + γ ) ] → v_A = γ v / (1 + γ )

So, v_A = γ v / (1 + γ )

Now, let's express this in terms of β (β = v/c), so v = β c.

So, v_A = (γ β c) / (1 + γ )

But γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²) = (1 - β²)^(-1/2).

So, let's write v_A as:

v_A = [ ( (1 - β²)^(-1/2) ) * β c ] / ( 1 + (1 - β²)^(-1/2) )

This looks complicated, but perhaps we can simplify it.

Let me denote γ = (1 - β²)^(-1/2) → γ = 1/sqrt(1 - β²).

So,

v_A = ( γ β c ) / (1 + γ )

Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(1 - β²):

v_A = [ (β c) ] / [ (1 + γ ) sqrt(1 - β²) ) ]

But since γ = 1/sqrt(1 - β²), sqrt(1 - β²) = 1/γ.

So,

v_A = [ β c / γ ] / [ (1 + γ ) * (1/γ) ) ]

Simplify denominator: (1 + γ ) * (1/γ ) = (1 + γ ) / γ.

So,

v_A = [ β c / γ ] / [ (1 + γ ) / γ ) ] = [ β c / γ ] * [ γ / (1 + γ) ) ] = β c / (1 + γ )

So, v_A = β c / (1 + γ )

But γ = 1/sqrt(1 - β²), so:

v_A = β c / [ 1 + 1/sqrt(1 - β²) ]

Hmm, perhaps we can write this in terms of β.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find an expression for β in terms of other variables.

Wait, let's go back to equation 2a: 4 γ_A = 3.127 (1 + γ )

Earlier, we found γ_A = [3.127 (1 + γ ) ] /4.

But what else do we know? From equation 1a, v_A = γ v / (1 + γ ), and v is the velocity of the antiproton.

But perhaps we can find another relation between γ and γ_A.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express γ in terms of γ_A.

Wait, let me think. From equation 2a: 4 γ_A =3.127 (1 + γ ) → 1 + γ = (4 γ_A ) /3.127 → γ = (4 γ_A /3.127 ) -1.

Substituting into v_A = γ v / (1 + γ ), and v = β c,

v_A = [ ( (4 γ_A /3.127 ) -1 ) * β c ] / ( (4 γ_A ) /3.127 )

Simplify:

v_A = [ ( (4 γ_A -3.127 ) /3.127 ) * β c ] * (3.127 / (4 γ_A ) )

Which simplifies to:

v_A = [ (4 γ_A -3.127 ) * β c ] / (4 γ_A )

But I'm not sure if this helps.

Alternatively, perhaps we can assume that the antiproton's velocity is such that its γ isn't too large, but given that it's moving slowly, γ ≈1.

If we make the approximation γ ≈1, then equation 2a becomes:

4 γ_A = 3.127 (1 +1 ) → 4 γ_A = 6.254 → γ_A ≈ 6.254 /4 ≈1.5635.

Which brings us back to the earlier calculation, giving v_A ≈0.77c.

But earlier, when I tried considering this approach, I ended up with conflicting results, which suggests that perhaps the initial assumption that all four A particles are moving in the same direction is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved in the center-of-momentum frame, and then the velocity is found, but I'm not sure.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is considering that the total energy and momentum are conserved in the lab frame, and that the A particles are all moving with the same velocity.

Wait, but given the options, and the calculation leading to v_A≈0.77c, which is option A, perhaps that's the intended answer.

But wait, earlier when I tried that approach, I ended up with a contradiction when I substituted into the equations. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to assume that the initial kinetic energy is negligible compared to the rest mass, so the initial energy is approximately 2 m_p c², and the final energy is 4 γ_A m_A c².

So,

4 γ_A m_A c² ≈ 2 m_p c² → γ_A ≈ (2 m_p) / (4 m_A ) ) →  (m_p)/(2 m_A ) → 938/(2*300 )= 938/600 ≈1.563.

Then v_A = c * sqrt(1 - (1/γ_A² )) → sqrt(1 - (1/(1.563)^2 )) → sqrt(1 - 1/(2.443 )) → sqrt(1 - 0.409 ) → sqrt(0.591 ) ≈ 0.769 c → approximately 0.77c, which is option A.

But wait, earlier I thought that this approach ignores the momentum component, but perhaps the problem is intended to be solved this way, assuming that the kinetic energy is small and thus the initial momentum is negligible, leading to the conclusion that the energy conservation gives the velocity.

But this approach ignores the momentum conservation, which would require that the final momentum equals the initial momentum. Since the initial momentum is small (antiproton is moving slowly), perhaps the problem is assuming that the initial momentum can be neglected, leading to the conclusion that the A particles' momenta sum up to zero, but that's not possible because the initial momentum isn't zero.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using only energy conservation, assuming that the initial momentum is negligible, which might not be a valid assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to model the situation where the initial momentum is non-negligible, but the energy and momentum equations lead to the velocity found earlier.

But given the options, and that the calculation gives v_A≈0.77c, I think the intended answer is option A) 0.77c.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the annihilation process **$p + \bar{p} \rightarrow 2A^+ + 2A^-$** using conservation of energy and momentum. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the rest energy of particle $A$ is given as $m_A c^2 = 300 \, \text{MeV}$. The proton mass is approximately $m_p c^2 = 938 \, \text{MeV}$.

### Key Assumptions and Approach:
1. **Initial State**:
   - The proton is at rest, so its energy is $m_p c^2$.
   - The antiproton is moving slowly, so its energy is approximated as $\gamma m_p c^2$, where $\gamma \approx 1$ due to its low velocity.

   Total initial energy:
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = m_p c^2 + \gamma m_p c^2 \approx m_p c^2 (1 + \gamma).
   \]
   Total initial momentum:
   \[
   p_{\text{initial}} = \gamma m_p v,
   \]
   where $v$ is the velocity of the antiproton.

2. **Final State**:
   - Four $A$ particles are produced: $2A^+$ and $2A^-$.
   - Each $A$ particle has energy $E_A = \gamma_A m_A c^2$ and momentum $p_A = \gamma_A m_A v_A$, where $\gamma_A = 1 / \sqrt{1 - v_A^2 / c^2}$ is the Lorentz factor for the $A$ particles.

   Total final energy:
   \[
   E_{\text{final}} = 4 \gamma_A m_A c^2.
   \]
   Total final momentum:
   \[
   p_{\text{final}} = 4 \gamma_A m_A v_A.
   \]

3. **Conservation Laws**:
   - **Energy Conservation**:
     \[
     4 \gamma_A m_A c^2 = m_p c^2 (1 + \gamma).
     \]
   - **Momentum Conservation**:
     \[
     4 \gamma_A m_A v_A = \gamma m_p v.
     \]

4. **Simplifications**:
   - Since the antiproton is moving slowly, $\gamma \approx 1$.
   - The ratio of the proton mass to the $A$ particle mass is:
     \[
     \frac{m_p}{m_A} = \frac{938}{300} \approx 3.127.
     \]

### Solving for $\gamma_A$:
From the energy conservation equation:
\[
4 \gamma_A m_A c^2 = m_p c^2 (1 + \gamma) \approx 2 m_p c^2.
\]
Dividing through by $m_A c^2$:
\[
4 \gamma_A = 2 \frac{m_p}{m_A} \approx 2 \cdot 3.127 = 6.254.
\]
\[
\gamma_A \approx \frac{6.254}{4} \approx 1.563.
\]

### Solving for $v_A$:
The Lorentz factor is related to the velocity by:
\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_A^2 / c^2}}.
\]
Rearranging:
\[
1 - \frac{v_A^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{\gamma_A^2}.
\]
\[
\frac{v_A^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_A^2}.
\]
Substituting $\gamma_A \approx 1.563$:
\[
\frac{v_A^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{(1.563)^2} \approx 1 - \frac{1}{2.443} \approx 1 - 0.409 = 0.591.
\]
\[
v_A \approx \sqrt{0.591} c \approx 0.769 c.
\]

### Conclusion:
The velocity of particle $A$ is approximately $0.77c$, which corresponds to **Option A**.
