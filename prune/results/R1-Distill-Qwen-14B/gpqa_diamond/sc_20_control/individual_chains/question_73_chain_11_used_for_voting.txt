Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I'm supposed to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let me think this through.

Alright, the problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction. So, we need to find two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just a simple subtraction, right? Because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't just do a classical velocity addition. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

The formula for relative velocity is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)), where u and v are the velocities of the two objects in the same reference frame. So, wait, let me get this straight. If astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction, then the relative speed of A with respect to B would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²).

Wait, let me compute that. The numerator is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c²/c²) which is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. Oh, so looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed. So that's a clue.

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. In relativity, the total energy isn't just the sum of their kinetic energies. Each object has rest mass energy plus kinetic energy. Wait, but do the astronauts' rest masses add, or do I have to consider their relativistic masses?

Wait, no. The total energy of the system should be the sum of each astronaut's total energy. Each total energy is gamma * m * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

So for astronaut A with mass 2m and speed 0.6c: gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy A is gamma_A * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For astronaut B with mass 3m and speed 0.5c: gamma_B = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So energy B is gamma_B * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3 m c² = approx 3.464 m c².

Adding them together: 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 m c². So the total energy is about 5.96 m c². Looking at the options, option C has E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c, which matches.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Gamma for A: 0.6c. 0.6 squared is 0.36. 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. Square root is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. Correct.

Energy A: 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c². Correct.

Gamma for B: 0.5c. (0.5)^2 is 0.25. 1 - 0.25 is 0.75. Square root of 0.75 is around 0.8660. So gamma is 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547. So 1.1547 *3 = 3.464. Yes, correct.

Total energy: 2.5 +3.464 =5.964, so approx 5.96 mc². So option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c.

Wait, what about the total energy? Do I need to consider any other factors, like the system's kinetic energy or anything else? Hmm, no. The total energy is simply the sum of each individual's total energy, which includes their rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So this should be correct.

Looking back at the options, option C is v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc². So the correct answer should be option C.

To solve the problem, we need to determine the relative speed of the two astronauts and the total energy of the system.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving at relativistic speeds is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.6c \) (for the astronaut with mass \( 2m \)) and \( v = 0.5c \) (for the astronaut with mass \( 3m \)). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of each astronaut is given by the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \) is the Lorentz factor.

#### For the astronaut with mass \( 2m \) and \( v = 0.6c \):
\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_A = \gamma_A (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For the astronaut with mass \( 3m \) and \( v = 0.5c \):
\[
\gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_B = \gamma_B (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is \( E \approx 5.96m c^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
