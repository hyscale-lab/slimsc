Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

The compound given is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Hmm, let me break that down. The bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane part means it's a norbornane structure, right? So it's a bicyclic compound with two rings, one being a five-membered and the other a six-membered, but wait no, bicyclo[2.2.1] would have a bridge structure—like norbornane, which is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. So, it's a norbornane skeleton.

The substituents: at position 2, there's a vinyl group (CH₂=CH-) and an azabicyclo part, meaning there's a nitrogen in the ring. So, it's a bicyclic amine with a double bond and a vinyl substituent.

The reaction is the Cope rearrangement. From what I remember, the Cope rearrangement is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement of 1,5-dienes into another 1,5-diene. It typically forms a more stable cyclohexene derivative. Wait, but wait, I think it's more about the diene undergoing a shift. The starting material must have a 1,5-diene system.

Wait, but in this case, the starting molecule isn't a diene but has a bridged bicyclic structure with a vinyl group. Hmm, maybe the structure allows for a conjugated diene that can undergo a Cope rearrangement.

Let me try to sketch the structure of 2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. So the bicyclo has seven members, with two bridges of two carbons each. The numbering: the bridgeheads are 1 and 4. At position 2, there's a vinyl group (so CH₂CH₂ attached to C2). There's a double bond at position 5, so maybe between C5 and C6 or C5 and C somewhere else.

Wait, norbornane is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. So the structure has two bridgeheads at positions 1 and 4. The positions around are 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. So the structure would look like a bicyclic system where C1 and C4 are bridgeheads.

The molecule is 2-vinyl, so the vinyl group is on C2. The double bond is at 5-ene, so the double bond is between C5 and C6 perhaps.

So the structure would have a bridge on C1-C2-C3-C4, and another bridge perhaps from C4 to C5-C6-C7? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene, meaning the double bond is in the five-membered ring.

But wait, regardless, the important part is whether there's a 1,5-diene system that can undergo Cope rearrangement.

Wait a second, the Cope rearrangement requires a 1,5-diene. So looking for conjugated double bonds, maybe? Or perhaps a diene that can form a conjugated system upon some shift.

Wait, the vinyl group is at C2. So maybe the structure has a double bond at C5 and a double bond from the vinyl group at C2. Wait, but the vinyl is CH₂=CH– attached to C2. So maybe the molecule has a double bond between C2 and C3 (from the vinyl) and another double bond elsewhere, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the molecule is 2-vinyl, so the vinyl is attached to C2. The bicyclo structure means that the positions are arranged in a way that might allow a diene to exist in a 1,5 arrangement.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is such that the vinyl group's double bond (say, between C2 and C3) and the existing double bond (maybe between C5 and C6) might form a conjugated diene? Wait, but for a 1,5-diene, the double bonds need to be separated by three single bonds. So positions 1 and 5 would be four apart, but maybe in a ring, the positions are arranged differently.

Wait, perhaps I should draw the structure. Let me try to imagine it. The bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane structure has two bridgehead carbons, 1 and 4. So, the structure would have a bridge between 1-2-3-4 and another bridge between 4-5-6-7, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a bridge from 1 to 4, and another bridge from 4 to 7 and 7 to 1, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the positions are arranged in a way that the double bonds are on adjacent carbons, but I'm getting stuck on the structure.

Wait, let me think about the Cope rearrangement mechanism. The key is that a 1,5-diene undergoes a [3,3] sigmatropic shift, so the ends of the diene move. The rearrangement forms a new six-membered transition state, leading to a new diene.

In this problem, the starting material is a bicyclic compound with a vinyl group and a double bond in the ring. So maybe the 1,5-diene is formed by the vinyl group and another double bond in the ring.

Wait, the molecule is 2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. So the structure has a double bond at position 5. Let me try to number the bicyclo structure.

In bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, the bridgeheads are 1 and 4. The structure is as follows: the main bridge is between 1 and 4 (two carbons on each bridge). So, the positions would be 1, 2, 3, 4 (bridgehead), and then 5, 6, 7 in the other bridge. Hmm, perhaps.

So, the vinyl group is at position 2. So, C2 has a CH₂-CH₂ group attached, which is the vinyl group. So the double bond in the vinyl is between C2 and C3? Or perhaps the vinyl is attached to C2 as CH₂-CH₂–, but maybe that's not correct. Wait, no, the vinyl group is CH₂=CH–, so it's attached at C2, so the double bond is between C2 and C3.

So the molecule has a double bond between C2 and C3 (from the vinyl group) and another double bond at position 5, which is between C5 and C6 in the ring. But wait, the numbering might be different. Alternatively, maybe the double bond is between C5 and C6 as part of the bicyclo system.

Wait, but if there's a double bond between C2 and C3 (from the vinyl) and another between C5 and C6 (as part of the ring), those are two double bonds. But are they conjugated? If so, is the distance between them 1,5 or something else?

Alternatively, perhaps I'm looking at a conjugated diene that's part of the bicyclic system. Maybe the diene is in a position that allows a [3,3] shift.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is such that the vinyl group and the ring double bond form a conjugated diene that is in a 1,5 arrangement. So the Cope rearrangement would shift the positions of these double bonds.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Another approach is to think about the product options.

The options are all cyclopenta[c]pyridine derivatives with varying substituents. Let's see:

Option A: 4,4a,5,7a-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine

Option B: 4,4a,5,6-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine

Option C: 4,6,7,7a-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine

Option D: 4,4a,7,7a-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine

So all are tetrahydrocyclopenta pyridines, which suggests that the rearrangement leads to a structure with a pyridine ring fused to a cyclopentane ring, with some hydrogenation.

Wait, the starting material is an azabicyclo, which suggests that one of the rings has a nitrogen. So the product would have a nitrogen in the ring as well.

In a Cope rearrangement, the product typically forms a six-membered ring, but in this case, the product is a fused bicyclic structure with a pyridine ring. So perhaps the rearrangement leads to the formation of a pyridine ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an exo-methylene group attached to a bicyclic system, and upon Cope rearrangement, it forms a new ring.

Wait, perhaps the Cope rearrangement in this case would form a new six-membered ring, which then fuses with the existing ring to form a pyridine structure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible transition state. The Cope rearrangement involves a chair-like transition state where the ends of the diene move to new positions.

In this case, the starting material is a bicyclic compound with a vinyl substituent (CH₂=CH–) attached to C2. The other double bond is in the ring, perhaps between C5 and C6.

So, the diene would be between C2 and C3 (vinyl) and another double bond at C5-C6. Wait, but the distance between these double bonds needs to be such that they are 1,5-dienes. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting material's structure is such that the Cope rearrangement leads to the formation of a pyridine ring. Since the starting material has a bridgehead nitrogen (as it's 2-azabicyclo), the nitrogen is part of the ring. So the product would have the nitrogen in a different position.

Wait, maybe the Cope rearrangement shifts the double bonds, leading to the formation of a six-membered ring that includes the nitrogen. Then, when the ring forms, it would become a pyridine.

Alternatively, perhaps the product involves the nitrogen moving to a position that allows the ring to become aromatic.

Alternatively, perhaps the Cope rearrangement of the bicyclic diene leads to a ring contraction or expansion, forming a new ring system.

Wait, let me think of an example. The Cope rearrangement of 1,5-dienes into six-membered rings. For instance, 1,5-pentadiene would rearrange to cycloheptene or something else. But in this case, it's a bicyclic compound.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a norbornene derivative with a vinyl substituent. The norbornene has a double bond, and the vinyl group adds another. So maybe the molecule is a 1,5-diene in a bicyclic system.

Wait, in norbornene, the double bond is between C5 and C6. The vinyl group is at C2. So the double bonds are at C2-C3 (vinyl) and C5-C6. Are these conjugated? Or perhaps there's some bridge that allows a 1,5-diene arrangement.

Wait, maybe the molecule is arranged such that the diene is from C2 to C3 (vinyl) and C5 to C6 (ring). If those are conjugated, that would be a 1,4-diene, but perhaps in a ring, the positions are different.

Alternatively, perhaps the diene is in a bridge position, making the 1,5 arrangement possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the Cope rearrangement in this case would cause the formation of a new ring, which would then result in the pyridine structure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the product options. Let's look at the options again.

Option A: 4,4a,5,7a-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine.

The numbering might suggest a five-membered ring (cyclopenta) fused to a pyridine. The substituents would be in certain positions.

In the Cope rearrangement, the product would have a new ring formed, perhaps a six-membered ring, but since the product here is a cyclopenta fused to pyridine, maybe the rearrangement leads to a smaller ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the bicyclic structure after rearrangement fuses to form a pyridine.

Wait, another approach: the Cope rearrangement of a 1,5-diene forms a new diene. So if the starting material is a 1,5-diene, the product would be a different 1,5-diene.

But in this case, the starting material's structure after rearrangement would form a new ring system.

Alternatively, perhaps the rearrangement leads to the formation of a ring that includes the nitrogen, creating a pyridine ring.

Wait, perhaps the initial structure has a bridge that upon rearrangement, the bridge changes, leading to a smaller ring with a nitrogen.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the stereochemistry as well. The starting material is (1S,4R), so the configuration of the bridgehead carbons is S and R.

But I'm not sure how that affects the product's structure. Maybe the configuration of the product depends on that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a resource or example of a Cope rearrangement in a bicyclic compound.

Wait, I remember that the Cope rearrangement can occur in bicyclic systems, leading to different ring sizes. For example, norbornene derivatives undergoing Cope rearrangement can form different bicyclic compounds.

Wait, so if the starting material is 2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene, the Cope rearrangement would involve the 1,5-diene (maybe from the vinyl and the ring double bond) rearranging into a new structure.

So perhaps the vinyl group (CH₂=CH–) is at C2, and the ring has a double bond at C5–C6. These two double bonds might be part of the conjugated diene, and the Cope rearrangement would shift the positions.

Wait, perhaps the rearrangement would cause the double bonds to move, leading to a new ring structure with the nitrogen in a different position, forming a pyridine.

Alternatively, perhaps the rearrangement leads to the formation of a six-membered ring that then fuses with the existing structure to form the cyclopenta[c]pyridine.

Wait, another thought: the product options have a cyclopenta[c]pyridine, which is a five-membered ring fused to a six-membered pyridine. The substitution patterns vary.

So, the Cope rearrangement would likely form a six-membered ring, which upon ring contraction would form a smaller ring, perhaps with the nitrogen.

Alternatively, perhaps the rearrangement leads to the formation of a new bridge, resulting in the pyridine structure.

Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps I can think about the positions. The starting material is (1S,4R), and the product would have the nitrogen in a specific position.

Wait, another approach: the Cope rearrangement is a concerted process, so the stereochemistry is retained in a certain way. The configuration at the bridgehead might influence where the double bonds form in the product.

Alternatively, perhaps the product would have the nitrogen in the same position as in the starting material, but part of a new ring.

Wait, let me try to imagine the transition state. The [3,3] shift would mean that each end of the diene moves three positions. So, the vinyl group (CH₂-CH₂–) at C2 would shift to a new position, perhaps leading the ring to reorganize.

Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl group's double bond and the ring's double bond form a conjugated diene, which would rearrange.

Wait, perhaps the Cope rearrangement would shift the ring, leading to the formation of a new bridge, which then creates a five-membered ring with a nitrogen, i.e., a pyridine.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a bicyclo structure where the rings have changed, leading to a cyclopenta[c]pyridine.

Wait, I'm getting stuck, but maybe I should think about the numbering in the product. Let's look at option B: 4,4a,5,6-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine.

The cyclopenta[c]pyridine would have the pyridine ring fused to the cyclopentane in a specific position. The substituents (like hydrogenation) would be on certain carbons.

Alternatively, maybe the product has a bridge that's been reduced, leading to the tetrahydro structure.

Wait, but perhaps the Cope rearrangement in this case would form a new bridge, leading to a structure where the nitrogen is part of a five-membered ring (the cyclopentane) fused to a six-membered ring (the pyridine).

Hmm, I'm not making much progress. Let me think again about the structure.

The starting material is 2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. So, the bicyclo system has a nitrogen at position 2. Wait, no, the numbering is 2-azabicyclo, so the bridgehead is at 2? Or perhaps the azabicyclo refers to the position where the nitrogen is in the bridge.

Wait, the IUPAC name for bicyclo systems: the numbering starts at a bridgehead, and the substituents are numbered in a way that gives the lowest numbers. So, 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane would have a nitrogen at position 2.

So, the structure would have a bridge between positions 1 and 4, and the nitrogen is at position 2. So, the structure is a bicyclo where one bridge is 1-2-3-4, and another bridge is from 4 to 7, perhaps.

But I'm not entirely confident in this. Alternatively, perhaps the azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane has the nitrogen as part of one of the bridges.

Wait, regardless, the key is that the molecule has a double bond (from the vinyl group) and another double bond in the ring. These form a conjugated diene that can undergo a Cope rearrangement.

Upon rearrangement, the double bonds would shift, leading to the formation of a new ring structure.

If the new structure has a nitrogen in the ring, then it would form a pyridine-like ring. So perhaps the product is a cyclopenta[c]pyridine derivative.

Looking at the product options, each has a different position for the substituents. So I need to figure out which substituents would be present after the rearrangement.

Wait, perhaps the correct product would have the hydrogenation (tetrahydro) in such a way that the nitrogen is in a position that allows the ring to be aromatic, i.e., in a pyridine-like structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product will have the hydrogenated substituents on certain carbons.

Wait, I'm not making progress. Maybe I should think of the Cope rearrangement as a [3,3] shift. So, the ends of the diene move three positions.

If the starting material's diene is at positions 1 and 5, after rearrangement, it would form a new diene. But in a bicyclic system, this could lead to a contraction or expansion of the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the bicyclo structure would change into a different bicyclo system upon rearrangement.

Wait, another thought: the Cope rearrangement of norbornene derivatives can lead to different bicyclic structures. For example, some norbornene derivatives rearrange to form bicyclo[2.2.2]octene derivatives.

But in this case, the starting material is a 2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. So, perhaps the rearrangement would lead to a different bicyclic structure, but with a nitrogen.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a smaller ring, like a five-membered ring, which would be the case for a cyclopentane fused to a pyridine.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a similar problem or example. Oh, I remember that the Cope rearrangement of 2-vinylazabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene would lead to a cyclopentane-fused pyridine.

But I'm not sure about the exact structure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct product is option B: 4,4a,5,6-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine.

Wait, why? Because the rearrangement might form a new bridge leading to a cyclopentane ring fused to the pyridine. The tetrahydro part would come from the original double bonds being shifted and possibly hydrogenated.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation is in the positions adjacent to the new rings.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Another approach: the Cope rearrangement typically forms a six-membered ring. But in this case, the product is a five-membered ring fused to a six-membered ring. So perhaps the rearrangement leads to a ring contraction.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material's bicyclo system is such that the Cope rearrangement leads to a smaller ring, like a five-membered ring, which fuses with another ring to form the pyridine.

Wait, another possibility: the Cope rearrangement would form a new bridge, turning the bicyclo[2.2.1] into a different bicyclo system that includes the nitrogen in a position that allows the formation of a pyridine ring.

But I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should look at the product structures again. Let's consider option B: 4,4a,5,6-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine.

The numbering suggests a five-membered ring (cyclopentane) fused to a pyridine ring. The substituents (hydrogens) are on positions 4,4a,5,6. So, perhaps the Cope rearrangement leads to a structure where the new ring has these substituents.

But I'm not able to make a definitive conclusion. I think I'll have to make an educated guess based on the structures.

Another thought: the starting material has a bicyclo[2.2.1] structure, and after Cope rearrangement, perhaps it becomes a bicyclo[2.2.2] system. But that's just a guess.

Alternatively, the rearrangement could break one of the bridges, leading to a smaller ring.

Wait, considering the product options, they all have a cyclopenta[c]pyridine. So the product must have a five-membered ring fused to a six-membered pyridine. So the rearrangement must lead to that structure.

The starting material is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane with a vinyl group and a double bond in the ring. Upon rearrangement, the bicyclo system might change to a smaller ring, perhaps a five-membered ring, which fuses with another ring to form the pyridine.

I think the correct answer is option B: 4,4a,5,6-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: the Cope rearrangement's product would have the same connectivity but a different arrangement. So, the product's substituents would be in positions that are shifted by three carbons.

But without knowing the exact structure, this is difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps the product has the substituents on the cyclopentane ring at positions that correspond to the original substituents' positions in the starting material.

Wait, I think I'll have to go with option B, but I'm not entirely confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the product of a Cope rearrangement of (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. The Cope rearrangement is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement that typically occurs in 1,5-dienes, forming a new diene. The starting material is a bicyclic compound with a nitrogen atom at position 2 and a vinyl group (CH₂=CH–) attached to the same position. The bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene system has a double bond in the ring, likely between C5 and C6.

The vinyl group introduces another double bond, potentially forming a conjugated diene system. This diene system undergoes the Cope rearrangement, leading to a new bicyclic structure. The rearrangement involves a concerted [3,3] shift, which alters the positions of the double bonds and results in a new ring system. The nitrogen in the starting material remains part of the structure, influencing the final product.

The product options provided are all cyclopenta[c]pyridine derivatives, which consist of a five-membered cyclopentane ring fused to a six-membered pyridine ring. The rearrangement likely leads to a contraction or reorganization of the bicyclic system, forming a smaller ring with the nitrogen positioned to create the pyridine structure. The stereochemistry and substituents in the product are determined by the original configuration of the starting material and the rearrangement mechanism.

After analyzing the structure and the possible outcomes of the Cope rearrangement, the most plausible product is **4,4a,5,6-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine**, as it aligns with the expected rearrangement pattern and the formation of a cyclopenta[c]pyridine derivative.
