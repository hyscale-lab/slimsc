Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that an unknown compound was prepared, and they used FTIR and 1H NMR to identify it. The FTIR shows a very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ and a strong one at 1700 cm⁻¹. The NMR has several peaks, none of which are vinyl hydrogens. Also, two specific signals in the NMR: one is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down. First, the IR data. A broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is typical for O-H stretching in carboxylic acids because they're usually broad due to hydrogen bonding. So the compound probably has a carboxylic acid group. The strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is likely a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Since it's a carboxylic acid, that would fit because the carbonyl in COOH is around there. So the structure must have a COOH group.

Now looking at the NMR. No vinyl hydrogens means there are no double bonds or triple bonds with adjacent hydrogens. So the compound is saturated; no alkenes or alkynes. That rules out any possibility of substituents that would imply unsaturation.

The NMR has several signals. Two of them have complex splitting patterns. Let me think about splitting. A doublet of triplets of quartets... that's a complex splitting. Or a doublet of triplets of triplets. That suggests that the protons in question are split by multiple neighboring groups, each with a different number of protons.

Wait, but what kind of structure would cause such splitting? Maybe a geminal di-substitution, like a carbon attached to two different groups. For example, if a carbon has two different substituents, each with several hydrogens, the neighboring protons would cause splitting. Alternatively, maybe the protons are next to multiple sets of non-equivalent protons.

Looking at the options, they're all carboxylic acids with substituents. Let me write them out.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me structure it better. It's CH2CH2? No, wait. Let me parse each option.

Option A: Structure is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. So the central part is a geminal di-substituted carbon attached to another geminal di-substituted carbon. Wait, maybe the structure is more like:

The molecule is (CH3)(C2H5)C-C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH? Wait, no, let me think again. The formula for option A is CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So the main chain might be longer, but there are two geminal di-substituted carbons. Alternatively, perhaps it's a neopentyl-like structure.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. So, this would have a structure where there are two adjacent carbons, each with a substituent. Like, maybe it's a geminal di-substitution on the same carbon adjacent to the COOH group.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH. So each of the two central carbons have two methyl groups attached. So, the structure is more like (CH3)2C-C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH. Wait, perhaps the two central carbons are each attached to two methyl groups.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So, the structure would have a CH2 group attached to a CH(CH3), which is next to another CH(CH3), and then the COOH group.

Wait, wait. Let me draw each structure.

Option A: The structure would be:

COOH-CH2-C(C2H5)(C2H5)-C(CH3)(H) ?

Wait, no, the formula is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. So, it's a 4-carbon chain, with each of the middle two carbons attached to a CH3 and a C2H5 group. Hmm, no, wait: the first CH3 is at the first carbon, then the next carbon has a CH with a C2H5 substituent, then another CH with another C2H5, then CH2 and COOH.

Wait, maybe it's (CH3) and (C2H5) on adjacent carbons. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3-CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. No, wait, the formula is CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. So, the chain is CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH, making it a four-carbon chain with substituents on the third and second carbons.

Wait, that's confusing. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

The main chain is CH2CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. No, perhaps the structure is:

CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5) - C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. So, the central two carbons each have a CH group attached to a C2H5 group.

Alternatively, perhaps the carbons are:

COOH - CH2 - C(C2H5)(H) - C(C2H5)(H) - CH2CH3. Wait, no, that doesn't fit. Maybe I'm getting stuck on the structure. Let me think about the NMR signals.

The NMR shows no vinyl hydrogens, so no double bonds. So the structure is fully saturated. So, all substituents are single bonds.

In the NMR, some protons are split into a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another into a doublet of triplets of triplets. That's a lot of splitting, which suggests each proton is adjacent to multiple sets of non-equivalent protons.

Wait, when a proton is next to multiple neighboring groups, each with a different number of hydrogens, the splitting becomes a doublet of doublets, or more. For example, if a proton is next to two different sets of protons, one with n and another with m, it would split into a doublet of doublets (if n=1, m=1), or a triplet of triplets or something more complex.

In the case of geminal protons, like in a structure such as (CH3)2CCH2COOH, the central CH2 would have neighboring groups. Wait, maybe the splitting comes from vicinal (adjacent) protons. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the compound has a geminal di-substitution, which leads to some of the protons being split in a certain way. Alternatively, maybe it's a branching point with multiple substituents.

Looking at the options. Let me consider the structures again.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH. So, that's:

CH3-C(H)(CH3) - C(H)(CH3) - CH2 - COOH

So, each of the two middle carbons has a methyl group and a CH group. Wait, each CH is connected to another CH, and each is attached to a CH3 and then a CH2COOH group.

So, the first CH3 is on the first carbon, then the next two carbons (2 and 3) each have a CH3 and a CH group. So, for the CH groups on carbons 2 and 3, each has a methyl group on the same carbon.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe the structure is:

CH3 - C(CH3)(H) - C(CH3)(H) - CH2 - COOH.

So, the second and third carbons each have a CH3 and a CH group.

In such a structure, the protons on the CH groups (i.e., the H attached to C2 and C3) would each be adjacent to which other protons? The C2 would be connected to C1 (with CH3 and H), and C3 (with CH3 and H). So the H on C2 would be adjacent to the H on C1 and the H on C3. Additionally, the C3 H would be adjacent to C2 H and C4's H (from CH2COOH).

Wait, but that might not account for the complex splitting. Alternatively, perhaps each CH group is adjacent to two different sets of protons.

Wait, let's think about the splitting. If a proton is next to two different groups of protons, each with a different number of neighboring H's, then the splitting would be a doublet of doublets, or more.

In Option C, the CH groups on C2 and C3 are each attached to a methyl group and another CH group. So, for the H on C2, what's nearby? It's adjacent to the H on C1 (which is a methyl group?), wait no. C1 is CH3, so the H on C1 is a methyl H, but perhaps the H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C1 (but C1 is CH3, so the H on C1 is a methyl group. Wait, no, the structure is CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

So, C1 is CH3, C2 is C(H)(CH3), C3 is C(H)(CH3), C4 is CH2, and C5 is COOH.

So, the H on C2 is attached to C2, which has a CH3 and another H. So, the H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C1 (but C1 is CH3, so the H on C1 is a methyl group, maybe a triplet or something). Wait, but in NMR, each proton is split by neighboring non-equivalent protons. So the H on C2 is attached to C2, which is next to C1 (CH3) and C3 (another CH group).

Wait, maybe the H on C2 is next to the H on C1 (but C1 is a CH3, so the H on C1 is a methyl group, which is split by C2's H. Wait, no, the H on C2 is adjacent to C1's H? Or are they on the same carbon? No, C1 is CH3, so the H on C2 is on the next carbon.

Wait, maybe the H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C3. Since C2 and C3 are each CH groups with a CH3 attached. So, the H on C2 would be next to the H on C3. Additionally, C2 is also adjacent to C1's CH3, which has three H's on C1.

Wait, perhaps the H on C2 is split by the H on C3 and by the CH3 on C1. So, the H on C2 would be a triplet due to the CH3 (n=3) and another split due to the H on C3 (n=1, so a doublet). So the splitting would be a triplet of doublets, which would appear as a sextet? Or perhaps a doublet of triplets?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about each situation. Each proton is split by adjacent protons. For a proton A, each neighboring proton B with n equivalent H's would split A into (n+1) peaks. If A is next to two different sets of protons, it's split into a doublet of doublets, or more.

In option C, the H on C2 is attached to a CH group. Let's look at the neighboring carbons.

C2 is connected to C1 (CH3) and C3 (another CH group). The H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C1's CH3 (but wait, C1 is CH3, so the H on C1 is a methyl group. So, the H on C2 is adjacent to the three H's on C1 (but C2 is on the next carbon, so they're vicinal, not geminal. So, the coupling would be between H on C2 and the three H's on C1's CH3. Similarly, the H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C3's CH group.

So, the H on C2 would be split by the three H's on C1 (n=3, so quartet?), and by the one H on C3 (n=1, so doublet). So, the splitting would first be a quartet from C1's CH3 and then each of those would be split into doublets by the H on C3. So that would be a quartet of doublets, or a doublet of quartets. Wait, but which comes first?

Alternatively, the splitting is multiplicative. Each coupling is applied in sequence. So, the H on C2 would first be split by the three H's on C1 into a quartet. Then each peak in that quartet would be split by the H on C3 into a doublet. So, the result would be a doublet of quartets, which is a total of 8 peaks. But the NMR description says a doublet of triplets of quartets. Hmm, that's more complex.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think of another possibility. Maybe the H on C2 is split by two groups of H's. For example, one group of 2 H's and another group of 1 H. So, if a H is next to a CH2 and a CH, that would lead to a triplet (from the CH2) and a doublet (from the CH), leading to a triplet of doublets, which would be 6 peaks. But the problem says a doublet of triplets of quartets, which is more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the H on C2 is adjacent to two CH groups and a CH3. Wait, maybe it's a more branched structure.

Looking back at the options, perhaps option A would have a structure with more branching. Let me think about option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So, the structure is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. So, the central two carbons each have a CH group attached to a C2H5 (ethyl) group.

So, the H on the second carbon (C2) is adjacent to the H on C1 (CH3) and the H on C3 (CH attached to ethyl). So, the H on C2 would be split by the H on C1 (CH3) and the H on C3.

Wait, but the CH3's H's are on C1, which is adjacent to C2, so the H on C2 would be split by the three H's on C1 (CH3), and the one H on C3 (CH). So, that's a quartet (from CH3) and a doublet (from CH), leading to a quartet of doublets (each peak in the quartet split into two), giving 8 peaks. But the NMR signals are described as doublet of triplets of quartets and another as doublet of triplets of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the H on the ethyl groups (C2H5) are causing more splitting. Wait, but in option A, the substituents on each CH are ethyl groups. So, the H on C2 (which is attached to CH(C2H5)) would be adjacent to the CH3 on C1 and the CH(C2H5) on C3. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the ethyl groups (C2H5) are causing more splitting. The ethyl groups have two sets of H's: the CH2 and the CH3. So, perhaps the H on C2 is adjacent to the H's on the ethyl groups, leading to more splitting.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the NMR signals again. The problem says one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. That suggests each proton is being split by three different sets of neighboring protons.

So, perhaps each proton is adjacent to three different groups, each with a different number of H's.

Wait, let's think about option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

Structure: COOH-CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no, let me write it again. The formula is CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So, the main chain is longer.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-C(CH3)(H) - C(CH3)(H) - CH2CH3.

Wait, no, that would make it more of a four-carbon chain. Wait, no, let's count the carbons. COOH is on the end, then the next is CH2, then C(H)(CH3), then another C(H)(CH3), then CH2CH3.

So, the protons on the central carbons (bonded to CH3 groups) would each have adjacent H's.

Let me consider the H on the CH(CH3) groups. For example, the H on the third carbon (C3) is attached to a CH3. So, the H on C3 is adjacent to the H on C2 (from CH2) and the H on C4 (another CH(CH3)).

Wait, perhaps the H on C3 is adjacent to the H's on C2 and C4. The C2 is CH2, so two H's, and C4 is CH(CH3), so one H. So, the H on C3 would be split by the two H's on C2 (a triplet) and the one H on C4 (a doublet). So, the splitting would be a triplet of doublets (or vice versa), leading to a sextet? But the problem mentions more complex splitting: doublet of triplets of quartets, for example.

Hmm. Another approach: in the NMR, the splitting patterns can indicate the number of neighboring H's. Let's think about the possible structures and their expected NMR signals.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH.

The structure is:

CH3 - C(CH3)(H) - C(CH3)(H) - CH2 - COOH.

So, the H's on C2 and C3 are each attached to a CH(CH3) group.

Each H on C2 is adjacent to:

- The H on C1 (which is CH3, so three H's). So, coupling with C1's three H's would lead to a quartet.

- The H on C3 (which is a CH(CH3), so one H). So, coupling with that would lead to a doublet.

So, the H on C2 would be a quartet split into doublets, i.e., a doublet of quartets, which would result in 8 peaks.

But the NMR description includes a doublet of triplets of quartets. That's more than two levels of splitting. So perhaps another coupling is happening.

Wait, maybe the CH2 group (C4) next to the COOH group has its own H's, which could be coupling with the H's on C3.

The H's on C4 (CH2) are adjacent to the H on C3. So, each H on C4 would be split by the H on C3 (n=1, so doublet) and perhaps any other neighboring H's.

Wait, but that's getting more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the H on C3 is split by two different sets: the CH3 on C1 and the CH2 on C4.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to think about each option and which would produce the described splitting.

Another approach: the splitting patterns in the NMR can help determine the number of neighboring H groups.

A doublet of triplets of quartets would mean that the proton is split by three different sets of neighboring H's. Each split adds a level. So, for example, if a proton is split first into a doublet (by one neighbor), then each of those is split into triplets (by another neighbor), and then each of those split into quartets (by a third neighbor), but that's a lot. Alternatively, it could be the product of splitting by three different groups, each with a certain number of H's.

Wait, perhaps it's a doublet (from one neighbor), triplet (from another), and quartet (from a third), all happening. So, the splitting would be 2 x 3 x 4 = 24 peaks? That's unlikely to be observed, but perhaps the integration averages it into a multiplet.

Alternatively, maybe the splitting is from two adjacent groups each causing their own splitting.

Wait, maybe the structure is such that each H is adjacent to two different CH groups, each with their own H's, leading to a more complex splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has a central CH group that's attached to two different branches, each with their own H's.

Wait, let me think about the ethyl groups in option B. Option B is CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. So, the structure is:

COOH - CH2 - C(H)(C2H5) - C(H)(C2H5) - CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps the H's on the central carbons (C2 and C3) are each attached to an ethyl group. So, the H on C2 is adjacent to C1 (CH2) and C3 (CH(C2H5)). Similarly, the H on C3 is adjacent to C2 and C4 (CH2CH3).

Hmm, perhaps the H on C2 is adjacent to the two H's on C1 (CH2), and the one H on C3 (CH(C2H5)). So, the H on C2 would be split by C1's two H's (triplet) and C3's one H (doublet), leading to a triplet of doublets (or a doublet of triplets). That would fit the description of a doublet of triplets.

Similarly, the H on C3 would be adjacent to the one H on C2 (doublet) and the two H's on C4 (CH2) (triplet), leading to a doublet of triplets, which matches one of the NMR signals.

Wait, but the problem states that one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, perhaps the ethyl groups (C2H5) have their own splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the H's on the ethyl groups are causing more splitting. For example, the CH2 in the ethyl group would have H's split by neighboring H's, but since the question says there are no vinyl H's, but the splitting could come from adjacent groups.

Wait, but in option B, the substituents are ethyl groups on the CH's. So, the H on C2 (the CH group) is attached to an ethyl group. The ethyl has a CH2 and a CH3.

So, the H on C2 would have neighboring H's from C1 (CH2, two H's) and C3 (CH, one H). So, the H on C2 would be split into a triplet (from C1) and a doublet (from C3), leading to a triplet of doublets.

But the problem mentions a doublet of triplets of quartets. Hmm, maybe the ethyl group's H's (the CH2) are also causing splitting. Wait, but the H's on CH2 are adjacent to the H on the CH group (C2), so they would be split into a doublet. But that's on a different carbon.

Alternatively, perhaps the H's on the CH2 of the ethyl group are splitting the H on the adjacent CH group.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the splitting patterns are due to the presence of geminal di-substitution. For example, if a carbon has two different substituents, each with their own sets of H's, the H's on that carbon would be split by the H's on adjacent carbons and perhaps other substituents.

This is getting a bit too tangled. Maybe I should think about the number of signals and their splitting based on the options.

Option C: Each of the two central CH's is attached to a CH3. So, the H on C2 is adjacent to the CH3 on C1 (three H's) and the CH on C3 (one H). So, the splitting would be quartet (from CH3) and doublet (from CH), leading to a quartet of doublets (8 peaks). Similarly, the H on C3 would be adjacent to the CH on C2 (one H) and the CH2 on C4 (two H's). So, the splitting would be a doublet (from C2) and a triplet (from C4), leading to a triplet of doublets (6 peaks).

But the problem's NMR has one signal as a doublet of triplets of quartets (several splits) and another as a doublet of triplets of triplets.

Option B's structure has CH groups attached to ethyl groups. So, the H on C2 would be adjacent to the CH2 on C1 (two H's) and the CH on C3 (one H). So, the H on C2 would be split into a triplet (from C1) and a doublet (from C3), leading to a triplet of doublets (6 peaks). The H on C3 would be adjacent to the CH on C2 (one H) and the CH2 on C4 (two H's). So, it would be a doublet (from C2) and a triplet (from C4), leading to a triplet of doublets (6 peaks). But the problem says one is a doublet of triplets of quartets and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets.

Wait, perhaps the ethyl groups (C2H5) have their own H's that cause further splitting. For example, the CH2 part of the ethyl group is next to the CH group, so the ethyl's CH2 H's would be split by the CH group's H's. But that would affect the CH2 signals, not the CH groups' H's.

Hmm. Maybe the correct structure is option C, which has two CH groups each attached to a CH3. So, the H's on these CH groups would be split by the CH3 (three H's) and the adjacent CH groups (one H each).

Wait, but in option C, the H on C2 is adjacent to C1 (CH3) and C3 (CH(CH3)). So, the H on C2 would be split by the CH3 (three H's) into a quartet. Then, it's also adjacent to the H on C3 (CH(CH3)), which is one H, so each peak in the quartet is split into a doublet, leading to a quartet of doublets (8 peaks). The problem says one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets. That doesn't match; doublet of triplets of quartets would be more splits.

Alternatively, perhaps the H on C3 is adjacent to the H on C2 (CH(CH3)) and the H on C4 (CH2). So, for C3's H: adjacent to one H (from C2) and two H's (from C4's CH2). So, the splitting would be a doublet (from C2) and a triplet (from C4), leading to a triplet of doublets. But the problem mentions a doublet of triplets of quartets, which is more splitting.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So, the structure is:

CH3 - C(H)(C2H5) - C(H)(C2H5) - CH2 - COOH.

In this case, the H on C2 is adjacent to the CH3 (three H's) and the H on C3 (which is a CH group with an ethyl substituent). So, the H on C2 would be a quartet (from CH3) and a doublet (from C3's H), leading to a quartet of doublets (8 peaks). The H on C3 is adjacent to the H on C2 (doublet) and the H on C4 (CH2, two H's), leading to a triplet (from C4) and a doublet (from C2), totaling a triplet of doublets (6 peaks).

But the NMR description has a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets, which is more complex. 

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

Structure: COOH - CH2 - C(H)(CH3) - C(H)(CH3) - CH2 - CH3.

So, the H on C2 (CH2) would be adjacent to the H's on C1 (CH3, three H's) and C3's H (CH(CH3)). So, the H on C2 would be split by the three H's from C1 (quartet) and the one H from C3 (doublet), leading to a quartet of doublets (8 peaks).

The H on C3 (CH(CH3)) is adjacent to the H on C2 (quartet, from C1) and the H on C4 (CH2, two H's). So, the H on C3 would be split by the two H's on C4 (triplet) and the one H on C2 (doublet), leading to a triplet of doublets. But the problem's description is more complex.

Wait, but the problem states that one of the NMR signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets. That's three levels of splitting. Perhaps the H on C3 is being split by three different groups. For example, the H on C3 is adjacent to two CH groups and something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the number of signals. The problem says several peaks were observed, but none correspond to vinyl H's.

Another point: the IR indicates a carboxylic acid, so the structure must have a COOH group.

Looking at the options:

- Options A, B, C, D all have COOH.

The number of H's in the NMR may help, but it's not given. The splitting patterns are key.

Wait, the problem says that one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. That's a lot of splitting, which suggests that each proton is being split by three different sets of neighboring H's. For example, each H is adjacent to three different groups with varying numbers of H's.

Which option leads to such a scenario?

Looking at option C again: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH.

Each CH group (C2 and C3) has a methyl group and a CH2 group further down.

The H on C2 is adjacent to the CH3 (3 H's) and the CH on C3 (1 H). So, quartet and doublet. But that's two levels of splitting, not three. So, not matching the problem's description.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH.

The H on C2 is adjacent to CH2 (2 H's) and CH (1 H). So, triplet and doublet, two levels.

Hmm. Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

The H on C2 is adjacent to CH3 (3 H's) and CH (1 H) from C3. So, quartet and doublet. Two levels.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

The H on C2 (CH2) is adjacent to C1 (CH3, 3 H's) and C3 (CH(CH3), 1 H). So, quartet and doublet. Two levels.

Hmm, but the problem's description has three levels of splitting. So, perhaps none of the options would produce that without another coupling. Alternatively, perhaps the ethyl groups in option B are causing more splitting.

Wait, the ethyl groups (C2H5) in option B have their own CH2 and CH3 H's. So, the H's on the CH2 part of the ethyl group would be split by the adjacent H's. But the problem states that none of the NMR signals correspond to vinyl H's, so ethyl H's would be present but as separate signals.

Alternatively, maybe the H on C3 in option B is adjacent to the CH2 group (ethyl), which has two H's. So, the H on C3 would be split by the two H's on C4 (CH2) and the one H on C2.

Wait, that would mean the H on C3 is adjacent to C2 (CH, 1 H) and C4 (CH2, 2 H's). So, the splitting would be a doublet (from C2) and a triplet (from C4), leading to a triplet of doublets (6 peaks). But the problem's description is more complex.

Wait, perhaps the H on C3 is adjacent to the ethyl group's H's. So, the ethyl group's CH2 is adjacent to C3, and its H's would split the C3 H.

So, the H on C3 would be split by the ethyl's CH2 (two H's, triplet), the H on C2 (one H, doublet), and perhaps the H on C4 (CH2, two H's, triplet). Wait, but that's three different couplings, leading to a triplet of doublets of triplets, which is a lot.

Alternatively, perhaps the H on C3 is adjacent to the ethyl group's CH2 group, leading to more splitting.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me think differently. The splitting described in the NMR is a doublet of triplets of quartets and another as a doublet of triplets of triplets. That implies that each proton is split by three different groups of H's.

Which of the options would have a proton adjacent to three different groups of H's?

Option A: The H on C2 is adjacent to CH3 (3 H's) and CH (1 H). Only two groups.

Option B: The H on C2 is adjacent to CH2 (2 H's) and CH (1 H). Two groups. The H on C3 is adjacent to CH (1 H) and CH2 (2 H's). Two groups.

Option C: The H on C2 is adjacent to CH3 (3 H's) and CH (1 H). Two groups.

Option D: The H on C2 is adjacent to CH3 (3 H's) and CH (1 H). Two groups.

Wait, none of the options seem to have a proton adjacent to three different groups. So, perhaps I've made a mistake in my analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the substituents is causing more splitting. For example, the ethyl group's CH2 may have its own H's that are adjacent to the CH group, leading to an additional split.

Wait, let me think about option B again. The structure is:

COOH - CH2 - C(H)(C2H5) - C(H)(C2H5) - CH2CH3.

The H's on the CH groups (C2 and C3) are each attached to ethyl groups. So, the H on C2 is adjacent to C1's CH2 (two H's) and C3's CH (one H). So, splitting into triplet (from C1) and doublet (from C3), leading to a triplet of doublets.

The H's on the ethyl groups (CH2 part) would be adjacent to the CH group. For example, the CH2 in the ethyl group on C2 is adjacent to the H on C2, so each H on the ethyl's CH2 would be split into a doublet. But that would be another signal, not the one described in the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps another group is causing an additional split. Wait, perhaps the central CH groups (C2 and C3) in option B are each attached to an ethyl group. So, the H on C2 is adjacent to:

- C1's CH2 (two H's) → triplet
- C3's CH (one H) → doublet

So, the H on C2 is a triplet of doublets.

The H on C3 is adjacent to:

- C2's CH (one H) → doublet
- C4's CH2 (two H's) → triplet

So, the H on C3 is a triplet of doublets.

But the problem describes one signal as a doublet of triplets of quartets and another as a doublet of triplets of triplets. This doesn't match. So perhaps option B is not the correct one.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the ethyl groups (C2H5) have their own H's that are adjacent to the CH groups. For example, the CH2 in the ethyl group is adjacent to the CH group, so their H's would cause splitting. So, the H on the ethyl's CH2 would be split by the H on the adjacent CH group (n=1, doublet), and the H's on the ethyl's CH3 would be split by the CH2's H's (n=2, triplet). But that would be a separate signal.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem refers to the same H being split by three groups. But I can't see any option that fits that.

Wait, perhaps the splitting is due to vicinal coupling with multiple substituents. For example, if a H is adjacent to two CH groups and another substituent.

Wait, looking at option C again: the structure is CH3-C(CH3)(H)-C(CH3)(H)-CH2-COOH.

The H on C2 is adjacent to the CH3 (three H's) and the CH on C3 (one H). So, quartet and doublet. But perhaps the CH2 group on C4 (CH2COOH) is adjacent to C3's H. So, the H on C3 is adjacent to C2's H (quartet?) and C4's H (CH2, two H's, triplet). So, the H on C3 would be split into a quartet (from C2) and a triplet (from C4), leading to a quartet of triplets, which would be 12 peaks. But the problem's description is a doublet of triplets of quartets, which is another way of saying the same thing, perhaps. Or vice versa.

Wait, the splitting would be quartet of triplets (from two couplings), but the problem describes it as a doublet of triplets of quartets, which implies three couplings. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the H's on C2 and C3 are each split by three groups. For example, the H on C2 is split by the CH3 (3 H's), the H on C3 (1 H), and perhaps another group, like the H on C4's CH2. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the splitting is due to more than just adjacent carbons. Maybe the substituents are causing additional coupling.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C because the structure would have the most symmetry, leading to fewer NMR signals. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the number of NMR signals. The problem says several peaks, but it doesn't specify how many. Option C has two CH groups, each attached to CH3. The CH2 group would have its own signal, and the COOH would have an -OH peak, but in D2O, perhaps it's exchanged and not observed.

But the problem doesn't provide integration data, so I can't rely on that.

Another approach: the FTIR data. A strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is likely a carbonyl, which is present in all options. The broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is O-H, so the compound is a carboxylic acid.

Now, let's think about the branching. The more branching, the fewer NMR signals. So, option C, which has two CH(CH3) groups, would have fewer signals.

But I'm not making progress. Maybe I should think about the splitting for each option.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

The H on C2 is attached to a CH(C2H5). It is adjacent to:

- C1 (CH3, 3 H's) → quartet
- C3 (CH(C2H5), 1 H) → doublet

So, the H on C2 is a quartet of doublets. Similarly, the H on C3 is adjacent to C2 (1 H) and C4 (CH2, 2 H's) → doublet of triplets.

So, the H on C3 would be a doublet of triplets.

The problem states that one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. So, perhaps the H on C3 is split further by the ethyl group's H's.

Wait, the ethyl group on C2 is C2H5. So, the H's on the ethyl's CH2 would be adjacent to C2's H, leading to a doublet. But that's for the ethyl's H's, not the CH group.

Hmm. This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should make a table of each option and their possible splitting.

Option | Structure | H on C2 | H on C3
--- | --- | --- | ---
A | CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH | quartet (C1 CH3) and doublet (C3 CH) → quartet of doublets | doublet (C2 CH) and triplet (C4 CH2) → doublet of triplets
B | CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)COOH | triplet (C1 CH2) and doublet (C3 CH) → triplet of doublets | doublet (C2 CH) and triplet (C4 CH2) → triplet of doublets
C | CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2COOH | quartet (C1 CH3) and doublet (C3 CH) → quartet of doublets | doublet (C2 CH) and triplet (C4 CH2) → triplet of doublets
D | CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)COOH | triplet (C1 CH2) and doublet (C3 CH) → triplet of doublets | doublet (C2 CH) and quartet (C4 CH2?) → not sure.

Looking back at the problem, one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. That would mean the proton is split into a quartet (from one group), then each of those split into triplets (from another), and each of those split into doublets (from a third). But I don't see any option where a proton is split by three different groups.

Wait, perhaps the ethyl group's H's are causing the third split. For example, the H on C2 (option A) is split by C1 (CH3, quartet), C3 (CH, doublet), and the ethyl's CH2 (two H's, triplet). So, the splitting would be quartet (3+1) → each peak split into triplets (2+1) → each of those split into doublets (1+1). So, quartet of triplet of doublets. But that's more splitting than observed. Alternatively, perhaps it's a doublet of triplets of quartets, which would mean each split is applied in a different order.

But I'm not confident. Given the time I've spent, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Because the H's in option C's structure would be split by CH3 and CH groups, leading to more complex splitting patterns that match the problem's description.

Wait, wait. The problem says that one of the signals in the 1H NMR is a doublet of triplets of quartets. So, the splitting order is doublet (from one group), then triplet (from another), then quartet (from a third). So, the first split is a doublet (n=1), then each of those split into triplets (n=2), then each split into quartets (n=3). So, the first split is from a group with one H, the second from a group with two H's, and the third from a group with three H's.

Which option would have a proton adjacent to a group with 1, 2, and 3 H's?

Looking at option C:

- The H on C2 is adjacent to C1's CH3 (3 H's) and C3's CH (1 H). So, that's 3 and 1. But where does the 2 come in?

Ah, perhaps the CH2 group (C4) has two H's. So, the H on C3 (CH(CH3)) is adjacent to C2's CH (1 H), C4's CH2 (2 H's), and maybe another group. But that would require three adjacent groups, which I don't see.

Alternatively, perhaps the H on C2 is split by C1's CH3 (3 H's, quartet), C3's CH (1 H, doublet), and the C4's CH2 (2 H's, triplet). So, that would be quartet of doublet of triplet. But the problem describes it as a doublet of triplet of quartets. So, order is different.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the splitting occurs in the order of the substituent groups. For example, the H is first split by one group into a doublet, then each peak is split by another group into triplets, and then each of those is split by a third group into quartets.

In option C, the H on C3 is adjacent to:

- C2's CH (1 H, doublet)
- C4's CH2 (2 H's, triplet)
- and perhaps the CH3 on C3 itself (but that's the same H, so not applicable)

So, the H on C3 would be split into a doublet (from C2), then each peak is split into triplets (from C4), leading to a triplet of doublets, which is 6 peaks. But the problem says a doublet of triplets of quartets, which is more splitting.

I think I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess. Based on the IR and the NMR splitting patterns, the correct structure likely has a central CH group attached to substituents that cause multiple splitting. Option C has two CH groups each attached to a CH3, leading to two levels of splitting. But the problem's description has three.

Wait, another possibility. The splitting could be due to the presence of geminal substituents. For example, in option C, the H on C2 is adjacent to a CH3 and a CH group. Additionally, perhaps the CH2 group on C4 is causing another split.

Wait, the H on C3 in option C is adjacent to C2 (CH group, 1 H), C4 (CH2, 2 H's), and perhaps the CH3 on C3 (but that's the same H).

So, the H on C3 would be split into a doublet (from C2) and a triplet (from C4), leading to a triplet of doublets. But the problem says a doublet of triplets of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 group is causing another split. For example, the H on C3 is adjacent to C4's CH2, which has two H's. So, the H on C3 would have coupling with C2's H (1 H, doublet), C4's H (2 H's, triplet), and perhaps another group, like the H's on C4's CH2.

Wait, but that would be two groups. Unless there's another substituent causing a third split.

I'm going to make a guess. Based on the FTIR, the compound is a carboxylic acid. The NMR shows no vinyl H's. The splitting patterns suggest that some H's are adjacent to multiple groups with varying H's. Among the options, option C has the structure where the central CH groups are attached to methyl groups, which would lead to splitting by the adjacent CH3 and CH groups. But perhaps the splitting is more complex because of the branching.

Wait, another angle: the number of signals. The problem says several peaks were observed, but none correspond to vinyl H's. Option C would have:

- CH3 (C1) as a singlet (if all CH3 are equivalent)
- CH groups (C2 and C3) as a doublet (if they are equivalent)
- CH2 (C4) as a triplet (due to coupling with C3's H)
- COOH's OH (broad, maybe not observed)

So, perhaps this leads to the described splitting. If the CH groups (C2 and C3) are equivalent, their H's would be a doublet, but the problem describes more complex splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure in option C leads to a doublet of triplets for the CH H's. Hmm.

Given the time I've spent and the analysis, I'll go with option C as the correct answer. But I'm not entirely sure.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying a compound based on FTIR and ¹H NMR data. The FTIR spectrum shows a broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹, indicative of an O-H stretch (likely from a carboxylic acid), and a strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹, corresponding to a carbonyl group. The ¹H NMR spectrum indicates no vinyl hydrogens, meaning the compound is fully saturated, and two complex splitting patterns: a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

#### **Option A: CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**
- The structure has two CH groups, each attached to an ethyl group (C₂H₅), and a CH₂ group adjacent to the COOH group.
- The H on C2 is adjacent to the CH₃ group (3 H's, quartet) and the CH group on C3 (1 H, doublet), leading to a quartet of doublets.
- The H on C3 is adjacent to the CH group on C2 (1 H, doublet) and the CH₂ group on C4 (2 H's, triplet), leading to a doublet of triplets.
- This structure does not produce the described splitting patterns (doublet of triplets of quartets and doublet of triplets of triplets).

#### **Option B: CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH**
- The structure has two CH groups, each attached to an ethyl group (C₂H₅), and a CH₂ group adjacent to the COOH group.
- The H on C2 is adjacent to the CH₂ group on C1 (2 H's, triplet) and the CH group on C3 (1 H, doublet), leading to a triplet of doublets.
- The H on C3 is adjacent to the CH group on C2 (1 H, doublet) and the CH₂ group on C4 (2 H's, triplet), leading to a doublet of triplets.
- This structure also does not produce the described splitting patterns.

#### **Option C: CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH**
- The structure has two CH groups, each attached to a methyl group (CH₃), and a CH₂ group adjacent to the COOH group.
- The H on C2 is adjacent to the CH₃ group on C1 (3 H's, quartet) and the CH group on C3 (1 H, doublet), leading to a quartet of doublets.
- The H on C3 is adjacent to the CH group on C2 (1 H, doublet) and the CH₂ group on C4 (2 H's, triplet), leading to a triplet of doublets.
- This structure does not fully account for the described splitting patterns but is closer than the others.

#### **Option D: CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH**
- The structure has two CH groups, each attached to a methyl group (CH₃), and a CH₂ group adjacent to the COOH group.
- The H on C2 is adjacent to the CH₂ group on C1 (2 H's, triplet) and the CH group on C3 (1 H, doublet), leading to a triplet of doublets.
- The H on C3 is adjacent to the CH group on C2 (1 H, doublet) and the CH₂ group on C4 (2 H's, triplet), leading to a doublet of triplets.
- This structure does not produce the described splitting patterns.

### Conclusion:
The splitting patterns described in the NMR (doublet of triplets of quartets and doublet of triplets of triplets) suggest that the protons are influenced by three distinct sets of neighboring hydrogens. While none of the options perfectly match this description, **Option C** is the most plausible because it involves CH groups with methyl substituents, which could lead to the observed splitting patterns due to coupling with adjacent CH₃ and CH₂ groups. 

ANSWER: C

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that an unknown compound was prepared, and they used FTIR and 1H NMR to identify it. The FTIR shows a very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ and a strong one at 1700 cm⁻¹. The NMR has several peaks, none of which are vinyl hydrogens. Also, two specific signals in the NMR: one is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down. First, the IR data. A broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is typical for O-H stretching in carboxylic acids because they're usually broad due to hydrogen bonding. So the compound probably has a carboxylic acid group. The strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is likely a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Since it's a carboxylic acid, that would fit because the carbonyl in COOH is around there. So the structure must have a COOH group.

Now looking at the NMR. No vinyl hydrogens means there are no double bonds or triple bonds with adjacent hydrogens. So the compound is saturated; no alkenes or alkynes. That rules out any possibility of substituents that would imply unsaturation.

The NMR has several signals. Two of them have complex splitting patterns. Let me think about splitting. A doublet of triplets of quartets... that's a complex splitting. Or a doublet of triplets of triplets. That suggests that the protons in question are split by multiple neighboring groups, each with a different number of protons.

Wait, but what kind of structure would cause such splitting? Maybe a geminal di-substitution, like a carbon attached to two different groups. For example, if a carbon has two different substituents, each with several hydrogens, the neighboring protons would cause splitting. Alternatively, maybe the protons are next to multiple sets of non-equivalent protons.

Looking at the options, they're all carboxylic acids with substituents. Let me write them out.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me structure it better. It's CH2CH2? No, wait. Let me parse each option.

Option A: Structure is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. So the central part is a geminal di-substituted carbon attached to another geminal di-substituted carbon. Wait, maybe the structure is more like:

The molecule is (CH3)(C2H5)C-C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH? Wait, no, let me think again. The formula for option A is CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So the main chain might be longer, but there are two geminal di-substituted carbons. Alternatively, perhaps it's a neopentyl-like structure.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. So, this would have a structure where there are two adjacent carbons, each with a substituent. Like, maybe it's a geminal di-substitution on the same carbon adjacent to the COOH group.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH. So each of the two central carbons have two methyl groups attached. So, the structure is more like (CH3)2C-C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH. Wait, perhaps the two central carbons are each attached to two methyl groups.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So, the structure would have a CH2 group attached to a CH(CH3), which is next to another CH(CH3), and then the COOH group.

Wait, wait. Let me draw each structure.

Option A: The structure would be:

COOH-CH2-C(C2H5)(C2H5)-C(CH3)(H) ?

Wait, no, the formula is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. So, it's a 4-carbon chain, with each of the middle two carbons attached to a CH3 and a C2H5 group. Hmm, no, wait: the first CH3 is at the first carbon, then the next carbon has a CH with a C2H5 substituent, then another CH with another C2H5, then CH2 and COOH.

Wait, maybe it's (CH3) and (C2H5) on adjacent carbons. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3-CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. No, wait, the formula is CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. So, the chain is CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH, making it a four-carbon chain with substituents on the third and second carbons.

Wait, that's confusing. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

The main chain is CH2CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. No, perhaps the structure is:

CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5) - C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. So, the central two carbons each have a CH group attached to a C2H5 group.

Alternatively, perhaps the carbons are:

COOH - CH2 - C(C2H5)(H) - C(C2H5)(H) - CH2CH3. Wait, no, that doesn't fit. Maybe I'm getting stuck on the structure. Let me think about the NMR signals.

The NMR shows no vinyl hydrogens, so no double bonds. So the structure is fully saturated. So, all substituents are single bonds.

In the NMR, some protons are split into a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another into a doublet of triplets of triplets. That's a lot of splitting, which suggests each proton is adjacent to multiple sets of non-equivalent protons.

Wait, when a proton is next to multiple neighboring groups, each with a different number of hydrogens, the splitting becomes a doublet of doublets, or more. For example, if a proton is next to two different sets of protons, one with n and another with m, it would split into a doublet of doublets (if n=1, m=1), or a triplet of triplets or something more complex.

In the case of geminal protons, like in a structure such as (CH3)2CCH2COOH, the central CH2 would have neighboring groups. Wait, maybe the splitting comes from vicinal (adjacent) protons. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the compound has a geminal di-substitution, which leads to some of the protons being split in a certain way. Alternatively, maybe it's a branching point with multiple substituents.

Looking at the options. Let me consider the structures again.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH. So, that's:

CH3-C(H)(CH3) - C(H)(CH3) - CH2 - COOH

So, each of the two middle carbons has a methyl group and a CH group. Wait, each CH is connected to another CH, and each is attached to a CH3 and then a CH2COOH group.

So, the first CH3 is on the first carbon, then the next two carbons (2 and 3) each have a CH3 and a CH group. So, for the CH groups on carbons 2 and 3, each has a methyl group on the same carbon.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe the structure is:

CH3 - C(CH3)(H) - C(CH3)(H) - CH2 - COOH.

So, the second and third carbons each have a CH3 and a CH group.

In such a structure, the protons on the CH groups (i.e., the H attached to C2 and C3) would each be adjacent to which other protons? The C2 would be connected to C1 (with CH3 and H), and C3 (with CH3 and H). So the H on C2 would be adjacent to the H on C1 and the H on C3. Additionally, the C3 H would be adjacent to C2 H and C4's H (from CH2COOH).

Wait, but that might not account for the complex splitting. Alternatively, perhaps each CH group is adjacent to two different sets of protons.

Wait, let's think about the splitting. If a proton is next to two different groups of protons, each with a different number of neighboring H's, then the splitting would be a doublet of doublets, or more.

In Option C, the CH groups on C2 and C3 are each attached to a methyl group and another CH group. So, for the H on C2, what's nearby? It's adjacent to the H on C1 (which is a methyl group?), wait no. C1 is CH3, so the H on C1 is a methyl H, but perhaps the H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C1 (but C1 is CH3, so the H on C1 is a methyl group. Wait, no, the structure is CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

So, C1 is CH3, C2 is C(H)(CH3), C3 is C(H)(CH3), C4 is CH2, and C5 is COOH.

So, the H on C2 is attached to C2, which has a CH3 and another H. So, the H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C1 (but C1 is CH3, so the H on C1 is a methyl group, maybe a triplet or something). Wait, but in NMR, each proton is split by neighboring non-equivalent protons. So the H on C2 is attached to C2, which is next to C1 (CH3) and C3 (another CH group).

Wait, maybe the H on C2 is next to the H on C1 (but C1 is a CH3, so the H on C1 is a methyl group, which is split by C2's H. Wait, no, the H on C2 is adjacent to C1's H? Or are they on the same carbon? No, C1 is CH3, so the H on C2 is on the next carbon.

Wait, maybe the H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C3. Since C2 and C3 are each CH groups with a CH3 attached. So, the H on C2 would be next to the H on C3. Additionally, C2 is also adjacent to C1's CH3, which has three H's on C1.

Wait, perhaps the H on C2 is split by the H on C3 and by the CH3 on C1. So, the H on C2 would be a triplet due to the CH3 (n=3) and another split due to the H on C3 (n=1, so a doublet). So the splitting would be a triplet of doublets, which would appear as a sextet? Or perhaps a doublet of triplets?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about each situation. Each proton is split by adjacent protons. For a proton A, each neighboring proton B with n equivalent H's would split A into (n+1) peaks. If A is next to two different sets of protons, it's split into a doublet of doublets, or more.

In option C, the H on C2 is attached to a CH group. Let's look at the neighboring carbons.

C2 is connected to C1 (CH3) and C3 (another CH group). The H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C1's CH3 (but wait, C1 is CH3, so the H on C1 is a methyl group. So, the H on C2 is adjacent to the three H's on C1 (but C2 is on the next carbon, so they're vicinal, not geminal. So, the coupling would be between H on C2 and the three H's on C1's CH3. Similarly, the H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C3's CH group.

So, the H on C2 would be split by the three H's on C1 (n=3, so quartet?), and by the one H on C3 (n=1, so doublet). So, the splitting would first be a quartet from C1's CH3 and then each of those would be split into doublets by the H on C3. So that would be a quartet of doublets, or a doublet of quartets. Wait, but which comes first?

Alternatively, the splitting is multiplicative. Each coupling is applied in sequence. So, the H on C2 would first be split by the three H's on C1 into a quartet. Then each peak in that quartet would be split by the H on C3 into a doublet. So, the result would be a doublet of quartets, which is a total of 8 peaks. But the NMR description says a doublet of triplets of quartets. Hmm, that's more complex.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think of another possibility. Maybe the H on C2 is split by two groups of H's. For example, one group of 2 H's and another group of 1 H. So, if a H is next to a CH2 and a CH, that would lead to a triplet (from the CH2) and a doublet (from the CH), leading to a triplet of doublets, which would be 6 peaks. But the problem says a doublet of triplets of quartets, which is more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the H on C2 is adjacent to two CH groups and a CH3. Wait, maybe it's a more branched structure.

Looking back at the options, perhaps option A would have a structure with more branching. Let me think about option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So, the structure is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. So, the central two carbons each have a CH group attached to a C2H5 (ethyl) group.

So, the H on the second carbon (C2) is adjacent to the H on C1 (CH3) and the H on C3 (CH attached to ethyl). So, the H on C2 would be split by the H on C1 (CH3) and the H on C3.

Wait, but the CH3's H's are on C1, which is adjacent to C2, so the H on C2 would be split by the three H's on C1 (CH3), and the one H on C3 (CH). So, that's a quartet (from CH3) and a doublet (from CH), leading to a quartet of doublets (each peak in the quartet split into two), giving 8 peaks. But the NMR signals are described as doublet of triplets of quartets and another as doublet of triplets of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the H on the ethyl groups (C2H5) are causing more splitting. Wait, but in option A, the substituents on each CH are ethyl groups. So, the H on C2 (which is attached to CH(C2H5)) would be adjacent to the CH3 on C1 and the CH(C2H5) on C3. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the ethyl groups (C2H5) are causing more splitting. The ethyl groups have two sets of H's: the CH2 and the CH3. So, perhaps the H on C2 is adjacent to the H's on the ethyl groups, leading to more splitting.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the NMR signals again. The problem says one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. That suggests each proton is being split by three different sets of neighboring protons.

So, perhaps each proton is adjacent to three different groups, each with a different number of H's.

Wait, let's think about option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

Structure: COOH-CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no, let me write it again. The formula is CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So, the main chain is longer.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-C(CH3)(H) - C(CH3)(H) - CH2CH3.

Wait, no, that would make it more of a four-carbon chain. Wait, no, let's count the carbons. COOH is on the end, then the next is CH2, then C(H)(CH3), then another C(H)(CH3), then CH2CH3.

So, the protons on the central carbons (bonded to CH3 groups) would each have adjacent H's.

Let me consider the H on the CH(CH3) groups. For example, the H on the third carbon (C3) is attached to a CH3. So, the H on C3 is adjacent to the H on C2 (from CH2) and the H on C4 (another CH(CH3)).

Wait, perhaps the H on C3 is adjacent to the H's on C2 and C4. The C2 is CH2, so two H's, and C4 is CH(CH3), so one H. So, the H on C3 would be split by the two H's on C2 (a triplet) and the one H on C4 (a doublet). So, the splitting would be a triplet of doublets (or vice versa), leading to a sextet? But the problem mentions more complex splitting: doublet of triplets of quartets, for example.

Hmm. Another approach: in the NMR, the splitting patterns can indicate the number of neighboring H's. Let's think about the possible structures and their expected NMR signals.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH.

The structure is:

CH3 - C(CH3)(H) - C(CH3)(H) - CH2 - COOH.

So, the H's on C2 and C3 are each attached to a CH(CH3) group.

Each H on C2 is adjacent to:

- The H on C1 (which is CH3, so three H's). So, coupling with C1's three H's would lead to a quartet.

- The H on C3 (which is a CH(CH3), so one H). So, coupling with that would lead to a doublet.

So, the H on C2 would be a quartet split into doublets, i.e., a doublet of quartets, which would result in 8 peaks.

But the NMR description includes a doublet of triplets of quartets. That's more than two levels of splitting. So perhaps another coupling is happening.

Wait, maybe the CH2 group (C4) next to the COOH group has its own H's, which could be coupling with the H's on C3.

The H's on C4 (CH2) are adjacent to the H on C3. So, each H on C4 would be split by the H on C3 (n=1, so doublet) and perhaps any other neighboring H's.

Wait, but that's getting more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the H on C3 is split by two different sets: the CH3 on C1 and the CH2 on C4.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to think about each option and which would produce the described splitting.

Another approach: the splitting patterns in the NMR can help determine the number of neighboring H groups.

A doublet of triplets of quartets would mean that the proton is split by three different sets of neighboring H's. Each split adds a level. So, for example, if a proton is split first into a doublet (by one neighbor), then each of those is split into triplets (by another neighbor), and then each of those split into quartets (by a third neighbor), but that's a lot. Alternatively, it could be the product of splitting by three different groups, each with a certain number of H's.

Wait, perhaps it's a doublet (from one neighbor), triplet (from another), and quartet (from a third), all happening. So, the splitting would be 2 x 3 x 4 = 24 peaks? That's unlikely to be observed, but perhaps the integration averages it into a multiplet.

Alternatively, maybe the splitting is from two adjacent groups each causing their own splitting.

Wait, maybe the structure is such that each H is adjacent to two different CH groups, each with their own H's, leading to a more complex splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has a central CH group that's attached to two different branches, each with their own H's.

Wait, let me think about the ethyl groups in option B. Option B is CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. So, the structure is:

COOH - CH2 - C(H)(C2H5) - C(H)(C2H5) - CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps the H's on the central carbons (C2 and C3) are each attached to an ethyl group. So, the H on C2 is adjacent to C1 (CH2) and C3 (CH(C2H5)). Similarly, the H on C3 is adjacent to C2 and C4 (CH2CH3).

Hmm, perhaps the H on C2 is adjacent to the two H's on C1 (CH2), and the one H on C3 (CH(C2H5)). So, the H on C2 would be split by C1's two H's (triplet) and C3's one H (doublet), leading to a triplet of doublets (or a doublet of triplets). That would fit the description of a doublet of triplets.

Similarly, the H on C3 would be adjacent to the one H on C2 (doublet) and the two H's on C4 (CH2) (triplet), leading to a doublet of triplets, which matches one of the NMR signals.

Wait, but the problem states that one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, perhaps the ethyl groups (C2H5) have their own splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the H's on the ethyl groups are causing more splitting. For example, the CH2 in the ethyl group would have H's split by neighboring H's, but since the question says there are no vinyl H's, but the splitting could come from adjacent groups.

Wait, but in option B, the substituents are ethyl groups on the CH's. So, the H on C2 (the CH group) is attached to an ethyl group. The ethyl has a CH2 and a CH3.

So, the H on C2 would have neighboring H's from C1 (CH2, two H's) and C3 (CH, one H). So, the H on C2 would be split into a triplet (from C1) and a doublet (from C3), leading to a triplet of doublets.

But the problem mentions a doublet of triplets of quartets. Hmm, maybe the ethyl group's H's (the CH2) are also causing splitting. Wait, but the H's on CH2 are adjacent to the H on the CH group (C2), so they would be split into a doublet. But that's on a different carbon.

Alternatively, perhaps the H's on the CH2 of the ethyl group are splitting the H on the adjacent CH group.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the splitting patterns are due to the presence of geminal di-substitution. For example, if a carbon has two different substituents, each with their own sets of H's, the H's on that carbon would be split by the H's on adjacent carbons and perhaps other substituents.

This is getting a bit too tangled. Maybe I should think about the number of signals and their splitting based on the options.

Option C: Each of the two central CH's is attached to a CH3. So, the H on C2 is adjacent to the CH3 on C1 (three H's) and the CH on C3 (one H). So, the splitting would be quartet (from CH3) and doublet (from CH), leading to a quartet of doublets (8 peaks). Similarly, the H on C3 would be adjacent to the CH on C2 (one H) and the CH2 on C4 (two H's). So, the splitting would be a doublet (from C2) and a triplet (from C4), leading to a triplet of doublets (6 peaks).

But the problem's NMR has one signal as a doublet of triplets of quartets (several splits) and another as a doublet of triplets of triplets.

Option B's structure has CH groups attached to ethyl groups. So, the H on C2 would be adjacent to the CH2 on C1 (two H's) and the CH on C3 (one H). So, the H on C2 would be split into a triplet (from C1) and a doublet (from C3), leading to a triplet of doublets (6 peaks). The H on C3 would be adjacent to the CH on C2 (one H) and the CH2 on C4 (two H's). So, it would be a doublet (from C2) and a triplet (from C4), leading to a triplet of doublets (6 peaks). But the problem says one is a doublet of triplets of quartets and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets.

Wait, perhaps the ethyl groups (C2H5) have their own H's that cause further splitting. For example, the CH2 part of the ethyl group is next to the CH group, so the ethyl's CH2 H's would be split by the CH group's H's. But that would affect the CH2 signals, not the CH groups' H's.

Hmm. Maybe the correct structure is option C, which has two CH groups each attached to a CH3. So, the H's on these CH groups would be split by the CH3 (three H's) and the adjacent CH groups (one H each).

Wait, but in option C, the H on C2 is adjacent to C1 (CH3) and C3 (CH(CH3)). So, the H on C2 would be split by the CH3 (three H's) into a quartet. Then, it's also adjacent to the H on C3 (CH(CH3)), which is one H, so each peak in the quartet is split into a doublet, leading to a quartet of doublets (8 peaks). The problem says one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets. That doesn't match; doublet of triplets of quartets would be more splits.

Alternatively, perhaps the H on C3 is adjacent to the H on C2 (CH(CH3)) and the H on C4 (CH2). So, for C3's H: adjacent to one H (from C2) and two H's (from C4's CH2). So, the splitting would be a doublet (from C2) and a triplet (from C4), leading to a triplet of doublets. But the problem mentions a doublet of triplets of quartets, which is more splitting.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So, the structure is:

CH3 - C(H)(C2H5) - C(H)(C2H5) - CH2 - COOH.

In this case, the H on C2 is adjacent to the CH3 (three H's) and the H on C3 (which is a CH group with an ethyl substituent). So, the H on C2 would be a quartet (from CH3) and a doublet (from C3's H), leading to a quartet of doublets (8 peaks). The H on C3 is adjacent to the H on C2 (doublet) and the H on C4 (CH2, two H's), leading to a triplet (from C4) and a doublet (from C2), totaling a triplet of doublets (6 peaks).

But the NMR description has a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets, which is more complex. 

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

Structure: COOH - CH2 - C(H)(CH3) - C(H)(CH3) - CH2 - CH3.

So, the H on C2 (CH2) would be adjacent to the H's on C1 (CH3, three H's) and C3's H (CH(CH3)). So, the H on C2 would be split by the three H's from C1 (quartet) and the one H from C3 (doublet), leading to a quartet of doublets (8 peaks).

The H on C3 (CH(CH3)) is adjacent to the H on C2 (quartet, from C1) and the H on C4 (CH2, two H's). So, the H on C3 would be split by the two H's on C4 (triplet) and the one H on C2 (doublet), leading to a triplet of doublets. But the problem's description is more complex.

Wait, but the problem states that one of the NMR signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets. That's three levels of splitting. Perhaps the H on C3 is being split by three different groups. For example, the H on C3 is adjacent to two CH groups and something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the number of signals. The problem says several peaks were observed, but none correspond to vinyl H's.

Another point: the IR indicates a carboxylic acid, so the structure must have a COOH group.

Looking at the options:

- Options A, B, C, D all have COOH.

The number of H's in the NMR may help, but it's not given. The splitting patterns are key.

Wait, the problem says that one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. That's a lot of splitting, which suggests that each proton is being split by three different sets of neighboring H's. For example, each H is adjacent to three different groups with varying numbers of H's.

Which option leads to such a scenario?

Looking at option C again: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH.

Each CH group (C2 and C3) has a methyl group and a CH2 group further down.

The H on C2 is adjacent to the CH3 (3 H's) and the CH on C3 (1 H). So, quartet and doublet. But that's two levels of splitting, not three. So, not matching the problem's description.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH.

The H on C2 is adjacent to CH2 (2 H's) and CH (1 H). So, triplet and doublet, two levels.

Hmm. Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

The H on C2 is adjacent to CH3 (3 H's) and CH (1 H) from C3. So, quartet and doublet. Two levels.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

The H on C2 (CH2) is adjacent to C1 (CH3, 3 H's) and C3 (CH(CH3), 1 H). So, quartet and doublet. Two levels.

Hmm, but the problem's description has three levels of splitting. So, perhaps none of the options would produce that without another coupling. Alternatively, perhaps the ethyl groups in option B are causing more splitting.

Wait, the ethyl groups (C2H5) in option B have their own CH2 and CH3 H's. So, the H's on the CH2 part of the ethyl group would be split by the adjacent H's. But the problem states that none of the NMR signals correspond to vinyl H's, so ethyl H's would be present but as separate signals.

Alternatively, maybe the H on C3 in option B is adjacent to the CH2 group (ethyl), which has two H's. So, the H on C3 would be split by the two H's on C4 (CH2) and the one H on C2.

Wait, that would mean the H on C3 is adjacent to C2 (CH, 1 H) and C4 (CH2, 2 H's). So, the splitting would be a doublet (from C2) and a triplet (from C4), leading to a triplet of doublets (6 peaks). But the problem's description is more complex.

Wait, perhaps the H on C3 is adjacent to the ethyl group's H's. So, the ethyl group's CH2 is adjacent to C3, and its H's would split the C3 H.

So, the H on C3 would be split by the ethyl's CH2 (two H's, triplet), the H on C2 (one H, doublet), and perhaps the H on C4 (CH2, two H's, triplet). Wait, but that's three different couplings, leading to a triplet of doublets of triplets, which is a lot.

Alternatively, perhaps the H on C3 is adjacent to the ethyl group's CH2 group, leading to more splitting.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me think differently. The splitting described in the NMR is a doublet of triplets of quartets and another as a doublet of triplets of triplets. That implies that each proton is split by three different groups of H's.

Which of the options would have a proton adjacent to three different groups of H's?

Option A: The H on C2 is adjacent to CH3 (3 H's) and CH (1 H). Only two groups.

Option B: The H on C2 is adjacent to CH2 (2 H's) and CH (1 H). Two groups. The H on C3 is adjacent to CH (1 H) and CH2 (2 H's). Two groups.

Option C: The H on C2 is adjacent to CH3 (3 H's) and CH (1 H). Two groups.

Option D: The H on C2 is adjacent to CH3 (3 H's) and CH (1 H). Two groups.

Wait, none of the options seem to have a proton adjacent to three different groups. So, perhaps I've made a mistake in my analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the substituents is causing more splitting. For example, the ethyl group's CH2 may have its own H's that are adjacent to the CH group, leading to an additional split.

Wait, let me think about option B again. The structure is:

COOH - CH2 - C(H)(C2H5) - C(H)(C2H5) - CH2CH3.

The H's on the CH groups (C2 and C3) are each attached to ethyl groups. So, the H on C2 is adjacent to C1's CH2 (two H's) and C3's CH (one H). So, splitting into triplet (from C1) and doublet (from C3), leading to a triplet of doublets.

The H's on the ethyl groups (CH2 part) would be adjacent to the CH group. For example, the CH2 in the ethyl group on C2 is adjacent to the H on C2, so each H on the ethyl's CH2 would be split into a doublet. But that would be another signal, not the one described in the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps another group is causing an additional split. Wait, perhaps the central CH groups (C2 and C3) in option B are each attached to an ethyl group. So, the H on C2 is adjacent to:

- C1's CH2 (two H's) → triplet
- C3's CH (one H) → doublet

So, the H on C2 is a triplet of doublets.

The H on C3 is adjacent to:

- C2's CH (one H) → doublet
- C4's CH2 (two H's) → triplet

So, the H on C3 is a triplet of doublets.

But the problem describes one signal as a doublet of triplets of quartets and another as a doublet of triplets of triplets. This doesn't match. So perhaps option B is not the correct one.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the ethyl groups (C2H5) have their own H's that are adjacent to the CH groups. For example, the CH2 in the ethyl group is adjacent to the CH group, so their H's would cause splitting. So, the H on the ethyl's CH2 would be split by the H on the adjacent CH group (n=1, doublet), and the H's on the ethyl's CH3 would be split by the CH2's H's (n=2, triplet). But that would be a separate signal.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem refers to the same H being split by three groups. But I can't see any option that fits that.

Wait, perhaps the splitting is due to vicinal coupling with multiple substituents. For example, if a H is adjacent to two CH groups and another substituent.

Wait, looking at option C again: the structure is CH3-C(CH3)(H)-C(CH3)(H)-CH2-COOH.

The H on C2 is adjacent to the CH3 (three H's) and the CH on C3 (one H). So, quartet and doublet. But perhaps the CH2 group on C4 (CH2COOH) is adjacent to C3's H. So, the H on C3 is adjacent to C2's H (quartet?) and C4's H (CH2, two H's, triplet). So, the H on C3 would be split into a quartet (from C2) and a triplet (from C4), leading to a quartet of triplets, which would be 12 peaks. But the problem's description is a doublet of triplets of quartets, which is another way of saying the same thing, perhaps. Or vice versa.

Wait, the splitting would be quartet of triplets (from two couplings), but the problem describes it as a doublet of triplets of quartets, which implies three couplings. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the H's on C2 and C3 are each split by three groups. For example, the H on C2 is split by the CH3 (3 H's), the H on C3 (1 H), and perhaps another group, like the H on C4's CH2. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the splitting is due to more than just adjacent carbons. Maybe the substituents are causing additional coupling.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C because the structure would have the most symmetry, leading to fewer NMR signals. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the number of NMR signals. The problem says several peaks, but it doesn't specify how many. Option C has two CH groups, each attached to CH3. The CH2 group would have its own signal, and the COOH would have an -OH peak, but in D2O, perhaps it's exchanged and not observed.

But the problem doesn't provide integration data, so I can't rely on that.

Another approach: the FTIR data. A strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is likely a carbonyl, which is present in all options. The broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is O-H, so the compound is a carboxylic acid.

Now, let's think about the branching. The more branching, the fewer NMR signals. So, option C, which has two CH(CH3) groups, would have fewer signals.

But I'm not making progress. Maybe I should think about the splitting for each option.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

The H on C2 is attached to a CH(C2H5). It is adjacent to:

- C1 (CH3, 3 H's) → quartet
- C3 (CH(C2H5), 1 H) → doublet

So, the H on C2 is a quartet of doublets. Similarly, the H on C3 is adjacent to C2 (1 H) and C4 (CH2, 2 H's) → doublet of triplets.

So, the H on C3 would be a doublet of triplets.

The problem states that one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. So, perhaps the H on C3 is split further by the ethyl group's H's.

Wait, the ethyl group on C2 is C2H5. So, the H's on the ethyl's CH2 would be adjacent to C2's H, leading to a doublet. But that's for the ethyl's H's, not the CH group.

Hmm. This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should make a table of each option and their possible splitting.

Option | Structure | H on C2 | H on C3
--- | --- | --- | ---
A | CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH | quartet (C1 CH3) and doublet (C3 CH) → quartet of doublets | doublet (C2 CH) and triplet (C4 CH2) → doublet of triplets
B | CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)COOH | triplet (C1 CH2) and doublet (C3 CH) → triplet of doublets | doublet (C2 CH) and triplet (C4 CH2) → triplet of doublets
C | CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2COOH | quartet (C1 CH3) and doublet (C3 CH) → quartet of doublets | doublet (C2 CH) and triplet (C4 CH2) → triplet of doublets
D | CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)COOH | triplet (C1 CH2) and doublet (C3 CH) → triplet of doublets | doublet (C2 CH) and quartet (C4 CH2?) → not sure.

Looking back at the problem, one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. That would mean the proton is split into a quartet (from one group), then each of those split into triplets (from another), and each of those split into doublets (from a third). But I don't see any option where a proton is split by three different groups.

Wait, perhaps the ethyl group's H's are causing the third split. For example, the H on C2 (option A) is split by C1 (CH3, quartet), C3 (CH, doublet), and the ethyl's CH2 (two H's, triplet). So, the splitting would be quartet (3+1) → each peak split into triplets (2+1) → each of those split into doublets (1+1). So, quartet of triplet of doublets. But that's more splitting than observed. Alternatively, perhaps it's a doublet of triplets of quartets, which would mean each split is applied in a different order.

But I'm not confident. Given the time I've spent, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Because the H's in option C's structure would be split by CH3 and CH groups, leading to more complex splitting patterns that match the problem's description.

Wait, wait. The problem says that one of the signals in the 1H NMR is a doublet of triplets of quartets. So, the splitting order is doublet (from one group), then triplet (from another), then quartet (from a third). So, the first split is a doublet (n=1), then each of those split into triplets (n=2), then each split into quartets (n=3). So, the first split is from a group with one H, the second from a group with two H's, and the third from a group with three H's.

Which option would have a proton adjacent to a group with 1, 2, and 3 H's?

Looking at option C:

- The H on C2 is adjacent to C1's CH3 (3 H's) and C3's CH (1 H). So, that's 3 and 1. But where does the 2 come in?

Ah, perhaps the CH2 group (C4) has two H's. So, the H on C3 (CH(CH3)) is adjacent to C2's CH (1 H), C4's CH2 (2 H's), and maybe another group. But that would require three adjacent groups, which I don't see.

Alternatively, perhaps the H on C2 is split by C1's CH3 (3 H's, quartet), C3's CH (1 H, doublet), and the C4's CH2 (2 H's, triplet). So, that would be quartet of doublet of triplet. But the problem describes it as a doublet of triplet of quartets. So, order is different.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the splitting occurs in the order of the substituent groups. For example, the H is first split by one group into a doublet, then each peak is split by another group into triplets, and then each of those is split by a third group into quartets.

In option C, the H on C3 is adjacent to:

- C2's CH (1 H, doublet)
- C4's CH2 (2 H's, triplet)
- and perhaps the CH3 on C3 itself (but that's the same H, so not applicable)

So, the H on C3 would be split into a doublet (from C2), then each peak is split into triplets (from C4), leading to a triplet of doublets, which is 6 peaks. But the problem says a doublet of triplets of quartets, which is more splitting.

I think I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess. Based on the IR and the NMR splitting patterns, the correct structure likely has a central CH group attached to substituents that cause multiple splitting. Option C has two CH groups each attached to a CH3, leading to two levels of splitting. But the problem's description has three.

Wait, another possibility. The splitting could be due to the presence of geminal substituents. For example, in option C, the H on C2 is adjacent to a CH3 and a CH group. Additionally, perhaps the CH2 group on C4 is causing another split.

Wait, the H on C3 in option C is adjacent to C2 (CH group, 1 H), C4 (CH2, 2 H's), and perhaps the CH3 on C3 (but that's the same H).

So, the H on C3 would be split into a doublet (from C2) and a triplet (from C4), leading to a triplet of doublets. But the problem says a doublet of triplets of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 group is causing another split. For example, the H on C3 is adjacent to C4's CH2, which has two H's. So, the H on C3 would have coupling with C2's H (1 H, doublet), C4's H (2 H's, triplet), and perhaps another group, like the H's on C4's CH2.

Wait, but that would be two groups. Unless there's another substituent causing a third split.

I'm going to make a guess. Based on the FTIR, the compound is a carboxylic acid. The NMR shows no vinyl H's. The splitting patterns suggest that some H's are adjacent to multiple groups with varying H's. Among the options, option C has the structure where the central CH groups are attached to methyl groups, which would lead to splitting by the adjacent CH3 and CH groups. But perhaps the splitting is more complex because of the branching.

Wait, another angle: the number of signals. The problem says several peaks were observed, but none correspond to vinyl H's. Option C would have:

- CH3 (C1) as a singlet (if all CH3 are equivalent)
- CH groups (C2 and C3) as a doublet (if they are equivalent)
- CH2 (C4) as a triplet (due to coupling with C3's H)
- COOH's OH (broad, maybe not observed)

So, perhaps this leads to the described splitting. If the CH groups (C2 and C3) are equivalent, their H's would be a doublet, but the problem describes more complex splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure in option C leads to a doublet of triplets for the CH H's. Hmm.

Given the time I've spent and the analysis, I'll go with option C as the correct answer. But I'm not entirely sure.


The question involves identifying a compound based on FTIR and ¹H NMR data. The FTIR spectrum shows a broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹, indicative of an O-H stretch (likely from a carboxylic acid), and a strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹, corresponding to a carbonyl group. The ¹H NMR spectrum indicates no vinyl hydrogens, meaning the compound is fully saturated, and two complex splitting patterns: a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

#### **Option A: CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**
- The structure has two CH groups, each attached to an ethyl group (C₂H₅), and a CH₂ group adjacent to the COOH group.
- The H on C2 is adjacent to the CH₃ group (3 H's, quartet) and the CH group on C3 (1 H, doublet), leading to a quartet of doublets.
- The H on C3 is adjacent to the CH group on C2 (1 H, doublet) and the CH₂ group on C4 (2 H's, triplet), leading to a doublet of triplets.
- This structure does not produce the described splitting patterns (doublet of triplets of quartets and doublet of triplets of triplets).

#### **Option B: CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH**
- The structure has two CH groups, each attached to an ethyl group (C₂H₅), and a CH₂ group adjacent to the COOH group.
- The H on C2 is adjacent to the CH₂ group on C1 (2 H's, triplet) and the CH group on C3 (1 H, doublet), leading to a triplet of doublets.
- The H on C3 is adjacent to the CH group on C2 (1 H, doublet) and the CH₂ group on C4 (2 H's, triplet), leading to a doublet of triplets.
- This structure also does not produce the described splitting patterns.

#### **Option C: CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH**
- The structure has two CH groups, each attached to a methyl group (CH₃), and a CH₂ group adjacent to the COOH group.
- The H on C2 is adjacent to the CH₃ group on C1 (3 H's, quartet) and the CH group on C3 (1 H, doublet), leading to a quartet of doublets.
- The H on C3 is adjacent to the CH group on C2 (1 H, doublet) and the CH₂ group on C4 (2 H's, triplet), leading to a triplet of doublets.
- This structure does not fully account for the described splitting patterns but is closer than the others.

#### **Option D: CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH**
- The structure has two CH groups, each attached to a methyl group (CH₃), and a CH₂ group adjacent to the COOH group.
- The H on C2 is adjacent to the CH₂ group on C1 (2 H's, triplet) and the CH group on C3 (1 H, doublet), leading to a triplet of doublets.
- The H on C3 is adjacent to the CH group on C2 (1 H, doublet) and the CH₂ group on C4 (2 H's, triplet), leading to a doublet of triplets.
- This structure does not produce the described splitting patterns.

### Conclusion:
The splitting patterns described in the NMR (doublet of triplets of quartets and doublet of triplets of triplets) suggest that the protons are influenced by three distinct sets of neighboring hydrogens. While none of the options perfectly match this description, **Option C** is the most plausible because it involves CH groups with methyl substituents, which could lead to the observed splitting patterns due to coupling with adjacent CH₃ and CH₂ groups.
