Okay, so I've got this physics question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is asking which of the given physical theories never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergences—places where the calculations give infinite results, which isn't physical. Regularization introduces a temporary cutoff to make the math manageable, and then you take the cutoff to infinity or absorb it somehow.

Wait, so the question is about which theory doesn't need this regularization. I'm trying to think about each option.

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. Classical theories, like Maxwell's equations, don't have the same issues as quantum theories because they're not dealing with the quantum mechanical effects. They don't involve things like renormalization because they're not quantized. So maybe classical theories don't require regularization because they don't have the divergences that quantum theories do. But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Do classical theories have any issues with high energies? Well, at high energies, maybe you need to go into quantum theories, so perhaps classical electrodynamics isn't the right choice here.

Wait, but the question is about whether regularization is needed. Regularization is a quantum field theory technique. So if the theory is not a quantum field theory, it might not need regularization. So D is classical, which is not a quantum theory. So unless the question is considering classical theories as part of the options, perhaps D is the correct answer.

Wait, let me think again. The other options are quantum theories. Quantum Chromodynamics (B) is a non-Abelian gauge theory, part of the Standard Model. QCD has issues like the Landau pole, and I think it does require regularization because of divergences. Similarly, Quantum Electrodynamics (C) definitely requires renormalization because of things like the electron mass and charge getting 'corrected' by loop diagrams, leading to infinities. So QED needs regularization, like using a cutoff or dimensional regularization.

Superstring Theory (A) is a quantum theory that unites quantum mechanics and general relativity. String theories aim to avoid some of the problems of point particle theories, like divergent loop corrections. I think in superstring theory, the theory is finite, meaning it doesn't have the same divergences that require regularization. Or does it? Wait, I might be mixing things up. I remember that in string theory, the perturbative expansion is organized in terms of a string tension, and the divergences that happen in point particle theories are tamed because the higher-order terms are different. So perhaps superstring theory doesn't require the same kind of regularization as QED or QCD because it's a background-independent theory and the divergences are softer or absent.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled here. The question is about which theory never requires regularization. So maybe the correct answer is D) Classical Electrodynamics because it's not a quantum theory and doesn't have these divergences that require regularization.

Alternatively, if the question is considering high-energy behavior, perhaps classical theories can't describe those energies. Oh wait, but at high energies, classical theories break down because you need quantum mechanics. So for high energies, you use quantum theories. So the question is about which theory never requires regularization. So the only theory that doesn't need regularization is the one that doesn't have these divergences.

Wait, let me think about each theory's need for regularization.

- Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD): Definitely requires regularization because of loop divergences, leading to things like beta functions and requiring renormalization.

- Quantum Electrodynamics (QED): Same, needs renormalization. So it requires regularization.

- Superstring Theory: I'm pretty sure string theories are free from some of the divergences that QED and QCD have. Or perhaps they are finite. For example, in certain formulations, like the heterotic string theory, the theory is finite. Or wait, I think in superstring theory, the tree-level scattering amplitudes are finite, but higher loops might require some kind of regularization? Or maybe not. I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Alternatively, superstring theory may not require regularization because it doesn't have the same divergences as point particle theories.

- Classical Electrodynamics: Doesn't require regularization because it's not a quantum theory. It's classical, so divergences like the infinite self-energy of a charge aren't handled with regularization. Instead, maybe you just accept them as part of the classical framework, or you use other methods like considering distributions or point charges differently.

Wait, but the question is about high energies. In classical electrodynamics, as you go to higher energies, you approach the quantum regime. So perhaps in the classical theory, you don't need regularization because it's not a quantum theory. So the answer would be D) Classical Electrodynamics.

So looking at the options, which theories are quantum? A, B, C are quantum. D is classical. So the only option that doesn't require regularization is D. Because the others are quantum and need regularization. So the answer should be D.

To determine which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies, we analyze the options:

- **Option A: Superstring Theory**  
  Superstring Theory is a quantum theory that aims to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity. While it addresses some divergences differently compared to point-particle theories, it still involves loop corrections and requires techniques like renormalization in certain formulations. Thus, it does require regularization in some contexts.

- **Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)**  
  QCD is a non-Abelian gauge theory describing the strong interaction. It suffers from divergences in loop calculations, such as the Landau pole problem, and requires regularization techniques like dimensional regularization or cutoff methods. Therefore, QCD requires regularization.

- **Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)**  
  QED is a quantum field theory describing electromagnetic interactions. It is well-known to require renormalization to handle infinities arising from loop diagrams, such as divergent electron self-energy corrections. Hence, QED requires regularization.

- **Option D: Classical Electrodynamics**  
  Classical Electrodynamics is a non-quantum theory based on Maxwell's equations. It does not involve the divergences or infinities that require regularization, as it is not a quantum field theory. While it breaks down at high energies where quantum effects become significant, it does not inherently require regularization within its framework.

Since regularization is a technique specific to quantum field theories to handle divergences, the only theory that never requires regularization is **Classical Electrodynamics**.
