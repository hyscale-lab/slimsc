Okay, so I have this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I remember parallax is related to distance. Let me think.

Wait, parallax is the apparent shift in a star's position as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I remember is that parallax (in parsecs) is the reciprocal of distance (in parsecs), so plx = 1/d. Oh right, so if a star is closer, its parallax is larger, and farther stars have smaller parallax.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. So I guess it's about how many stars exist between certain parallax ranges. Since stars are uniformly distributed, their density in space is the same. Wait, but if the number per unit volume is constant, how does that translate to parallax?

So, in space, uniform distribution means that the number of stars in a spherical shell depends on the volume. The volume of a shell at radius r with thickness dr is 4πr² dr. Because the number density is uniform, number of stars is proportional to volume.

But since parallax plx is 1/d, and d is distance. Let me substitute d = 1/plx. So, r is d, so it's 1/plx. Then the volume element as a function of plx would be a bit tricky.

Wait, what's the differential volume in terms of parallax? Let me think. Suppose I have a thin shell at distance d, with thickness dd. The volume is 4πd² dd. So the number of stars in that shell is proportional to d² dd.

But since plx is 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So, substituting, d² = (1/plx)^2 = 1/(plx^2), and dd would be the change in d. But since plx = 1/d, dd = - (1/(plx²)) d plx. Because plx is 1/d, so d plx = - (1/d²) dd → dd = -d² d plx.

Wait, I'm trying to express the volume element in terms of plx. Let me redo this substitution.

Number of stars in a shell at distance d is proportional to d² dd. So, d is 1/plx.

So, d² = 1/(plx)^2.

And dd is the change in d. Let's express in terms of plx. So, since plx = 1/d → d plx = -1/(d²) → d plx = - d².

Wait, no. Let me take the derivative. d (plx) = d (1/d) = - (1/d²) dd. So, dd = - (d²) d plx.

But d = 1/plx → d² = 1/(plx)^2.

So, substituting, dd = -(1/(plx)^2) d plx.

So, the number of stars in a shell is proportional to d² dd → which is (1/(plx²)) * [ -(1/(plx^2)) d plx ].

Wait, but the negative sign indicates the direction of change, but since we're dealing with magnitudes, we can ignore the sign. So the number of stars in a shell at parallax plx is proportional to (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) d plx, which is (1/plx^4) d plx.

Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, no. Wait, the number of stars is proportional to d² dd. So, substituting d² = 1/(plx)^2, and dd = -(1/(plx^2)) d plx. So, d² dd becomes (1/plx²)(1/plx² d plx) ) = 1/(plx^4) d plx.

Wait, so the number of stars per unit parallax is proportional to 1/(plx^4) per d plx.

But the question is about the number per unit range of plx. So, if I consider a small change in plx (d plx), the number of stars in that range is (1/plx^4) * d plx. So, the number per unit plx is 1/(plx^4). But wait, that's the number per unit plx. So, the number of stars per unit parallax interval (like per 0.1 parsec of plx) would decrease as 1/plx^4.

Wait, but let's think again. Because when plx increases (so closer stars), the number of stars should be higher because there are more stars nearby.

If the number per unit plx is 1/plx^4, that means higher plx (smaller distances) would have more stars. Because as plx increases, 1/plx^4 increases, so the number per unit plx would be higher. That makes sense because closer stars are more numerous in each unit of plx.

Wait, but that would mean that for a given plx range, say from plx to plx + d plx, the number of stars is proportional to 1/plx^4. So, when plx is small (very distant stars), the number per unit plx is smaller, as 1 over a larger number to the fourth power.

But wait, the question is phrased as "how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx". So it's the number per unit plx.

Wait, another approach: for uniform distribution in 3D space, the number density is n stars per unit volume. The volume as a function of distance is a sphere of radius d. The number of stars within a thin shell of radius d and thickness dd is 4πd² dd * n.

So, number of stars in shell is 4πn d² dd. Now, let's change variables from d to plx. Since plx = 1/d, we have d = 1/plx. So, d² = 1/(plx)^2.

And dd is the change in d. So, let's find dd in terms of d plx.

d (plx) = d (1/d) ) = -1/(d²) dd. So, dd = -d² d plx. Again, the negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases.

So substituting into the number of stars:

Number = 4πn * (1/(plx)^2) * (-d^2 d plx )

But d = 1/plx → d² = 1/(plx)^2.

So, substituting:

Number = 4πn * (1/(plx)^2) * ( (1/(plx)^2) ) * d plx )

Wait, let me compute that.

Wait, the expression is: 4πn * (1/(plx)^2) * ( - (1/(plx^2)) d plx )

So the number is proportional to (1/plx^4) d plx. So, the number of stars per unit range of plx is (1/plx^4) multiplied by the differential plx.

Hmm, so the number of stars in a small plx interval d plx is proportional to 1/plx^4 * d plx.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So, per unit plx, it's 1/plx^4.

But wait, that seems a bit odd. Let me think of it in terms of flux or something else maybe.

Another way: the number of stars as a function of parallax.

If I plot number of stars (N) against parallax plx, each unit increase in plx (like from 1 to 2) would enclose a certain number of stars. But I think the number of stars in each plx bin is higher for smaller plx (because the volume increases as 1/(plx^4)).

Alternatively, since the number of stars up to a certain parallax depends on the volume, but perhaps the distribution per unit plx is 1/plx^4.

Wait, let's think of it as a differential: the number of stars with parallax between plx and plx + d plx is proportional to 1/(plx^4) * d plx.

So, the number per unit plx is 1/(plx^4).

Wait, but looking at the answer options, option A is ~ 1/plx^4, which would match this. But I'm not so sure because I might have made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, another approach. Let's consider that the number of stars per unit volume is uniform (n). The volume of a sphere of radius d is (4/3)π d^3. The number of stars up to distance d is (4/3) π d^3 n.

But if we look at the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d, it's the derivative of that with respect to d. So, dN/dd = 4 π d^2 n.

Now, to find dN/d plx, since plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx.

So, dN/d plx = dN/dd * dd/d plx.

We have dN/dd = 4 π d² n. And dd/d plx is the derivative of d with respect to plx.

d = 1/plx → dd/d plx = -1/(plx^2).

So,

dN/d plx = (4 π (1/plx)^2 n) ) * (-1/(plx^2)) )

The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, the number of stars decreases, which makes sense because higher plx (closer stars) are more numerous.

So, ignoring the negative for the sake of magnitude, dN/d plx = 4 π n (1/plx^4 )

So the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/(plx^4). So the correct answer would be option A.

Wait, but I thought earlier that maybe the answer is option D. Oh wait, why? Because I might have mixed up the exponents.

Wait, let me check the steps again.

dN/d plx = 4 π n (1/(plx)^2) * (-1/(plx^2)) )

Which is 4 π n (1/(plx^4) ) * (-1), so the magnitude is 1/(plx^4). So the number per unit plx is 1/(plx^4), so option A.

But wait, another way: the number of stars per unit volume is same everywhere. So, the number in a shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4π d² dd * n. So, how does that translate into plx?

As plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. So, d^2 = 1/(plx^2).

And dd is in terms of plx. Since plx = 1/d → d plx = -1/(d^2) dd → dd = -d^2 d plx.

So, substituting into the number:

4 π n (1/(plx^2)) * (-1/(plx^2) d plx) )

Which again gives number per unit plx as 4 π n (1/(plx^4)).

So yeah, that's 1/(plx^4). So the number decreases with plx^4. So answer must be A.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely related to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance to the star. For a uniformly distributed population of stars, the number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( 4\pi d^2 dd \).

To express the number of stars per unit range of parallax, we change variables from \( d \) to \( \text{plx} \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), we find:

\[
d^2 = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2}, \quad dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}.
\]

The number of stars in a shell is proportional to \( d^2 dd \), so substituting the expressions for \( d^2 \) and \( dd \):

\[
\text{Number of stars} \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right).
\]

Simplifying, the number of stars per unit range of parallax becomes:

\[
\text{Number of stars per unit plx} \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

This indicates that the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
