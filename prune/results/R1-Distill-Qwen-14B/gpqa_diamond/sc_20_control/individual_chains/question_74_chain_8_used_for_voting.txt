Okay, so I have this question about radioactive decay, and I need to find the probability that a particular atom will decay in the next 150 minutes given that it hasn't decayed for the first 50 minutes. Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential law, but let me think through it step by step.

Wait, the question says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. Oh wait, do they mean the probability of decay in 100 minutes, or the decay constant? Because I think the typical formula uses the decay constant multiplied by time, but maybe they're giving the cumulative probability over 100 minutes.

So, the decay probability P(t) is often given by P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant and t is time. But wait, for small probabilities, sometimes people approximate it as P≈λt, but 32% isn't that small, so probably I should use the exact formula.

But wait, the problem is asking about the probability after 50 minutes have already passed without decay. So, I think I need to consider the conditional probability here. Because the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes is different from the initial case.

Let me break it down. The total time from now is 150 minutes. But wait, the initial condition is that the atom hasn't decayed for 50 minutes. So the probability that it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes is (1 - P(50)), but wait, more accurately, the probability it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes is e^(-λ*50), because the survival probability is e^(-λt). Then, the probability that it decays at some time between t=50 and t=200 (50+150) is the difference between the survival probabilities at those times.

Wait, no, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes after t=50 is the same as the probability of decaying between t=50 and t=200. So, the survival probability at 200 is e^(-λ*200), and at 50 it's e^(-λ*50). So the probability of decaying between 50 and 200 is the complement of surviving 200 minutes, which is 1 - e^(-λ*200), but wait, no, that's the probability from t=0. Because the decay process is memoryless, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes after any time t is the same as the probability of decaying within 150 minutes starting at t=0. Because the exponential distribution has no memory.

Wait, that's a key point. Radioactive decay is memoryless, so the probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of it decaying in any subsequent 150-minute period, regardless of how much time has already passed. So if I know the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%, I can find λ, and then compute the probability for 150 minutes from the current time.

Wait, but the problem is not that. The problem says that 50 minutes have passed without decay. So the probability we're looking for is P(150) after 50 minutes. But since it's memoryless, that's equal to P(150). So the same as the probability over 150 minutes from time zero. Hmm, but the given probability is for 100 minutes, not 150.

So perhaps I should first find the decay constant λ based on the given 32% probability in 100 minutes.

Let me write that down. Let's denote the decay probability in 100 minutes as P(100) = 32% or 0.32.

So,

P(100) = 1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32.

Solving for λ:

e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.

Take the natural logarithm of both sides:

-100λ = ln(0.68).

So,

λ = - ln(0.68)/100.

Calculate ln(0.68): ln(0.68) is approximately ln(2/3) is about -0.4055, but wait, 0.68 is a bit less than 2/3 (0.666...), so ln(0.68) is about -0.38566.

So,

λ ≈ 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Now, the question is asking for the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes. So, P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150).

Plugging in λ:

P(150) = 1 - e^(-0.0038566 * 150).

Compute 0.0038566 * 150: 0.0038566 * 150 ≈ 0.57849.

So, e^(-0.57849) is approximately e^-0.57849. Let's calculate that.

I remember that e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, and e^-0.6 is roughly 0.5488. So 0.57849 is between 0.5 and 0.6.

Compute more accurately: 0.57849.

We can use the approximation or a calculator, but perhaps I can remember that ln(2) is about 0.6931. So 0.57849 is about 0.6931 * 0.835. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, let's use a calculator approach.

e^-0.57849 ≈ 1/(e^0.57849).

Compute e^0.57849.

We know that e^0.5=1.6487, e^0.6=1.8221, e^0.57849 is about?

Let me think: 0.57849 is approximately 0.5 + 0.07849.

e^0.5 = 1.64872.

e^0.07849: we can approximate using the Taylor series.

e^x ≈ 1 + x + x²/2 + x^3/6.

x=0.07849.

x^2 ≈ 0.00616.

x^3≈ 0.000483.

So,

e^0.07849 ≈ 1 + 0.07849 + 0.00616/2 + 0.000483/6.

= 1.07849 + 0.00308 + 0.0000805.

≈ 1.08165.

So, e^0.57849 ≈ e^0.5 * e^0.07849 ≈ 1.64872 * 1.08165 ≈ let's compute that.

1.64872 * 1.08 = 1.64872 * 1 = 1.64872. 1.64872 * 0.08 = 0.131898. So total ~1.780618.

Then, 1.08165 is 0.00165 more. So 1.64872 * 0.00165 ≈ 0.00272. So total e^0.57849 ≈ approximately 1.7833.

But wait, perhaps more accurately, 1.64872 * 1.08165.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute 1.64872 * 1.08165:

1.64872 * 1 = 1.64872

1.64872 * 0.08 = 0.1318976

1.64872 * 0.00165 = approx 0.0027208.

Adding these up: 1.64872 + 0.1318976 = 1.7806176 + 0.0027208 ≈ 1.783338.

So e^0.57849 ≈ 1.7833.

So e^-0.57849 ≈ 1/1.7833 ≈ 0.56.

Wait, wait. 1.7833's reciprocal is approximately 0.56. Because 1.7833 * 0.56 ≈ 1. So e^-0.57849 ≈ 0.56.

But let me double-check. 1.7833 * 0.56 = ?

1.7833 * 0.5 = 0.89165

1.7833 * 0.06 = 0.106998

Adding, 0.89165 + 0.106998 ≈ 0.99865, which is close to 1. So 1.7833 * 0.56 ≈ 0.99865, which is very close to 1. So e^-0.57849 ≈ 0.56.

So, P(150) = 1 - 0.56 = 0.44, which is 44%.

Looking at the options, option A is 44%, so the answer would be A.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate it more accurately. Let me try to compute 0.0038566 * 150.

0.0038566 * 150 = 0.0038566 * 150 = 0.57849.

So, e^-0.57849 is about 0.56, as before.

So 1 - 0.56 = 0.44, 44% which is option A. So the probability is 44%.

Wait, but the answer isn't possible because the probability for 100 minutes is 32%, and 150 is longer than 100, so the probability should be higher than 32%. But 44% is higher, which makes sense. So yes, option A is 44%.

To determine the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, we use the exponential decay law. The decay probability is given by:

\[
P(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
\]

where \( \lambda \) is the decay constant and \( t \) is the time. From the problem, we know that the decay probability over 100 minutes is 32%, or \( P(100) = 0.32 \). Using this, we can calculate \( \lambda \):

\[
P(100) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 0.32
\]

\[
e^{-100\lambda} = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-100\lambda = \ln(0.68)
\]

\[
\lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100}
\]

Using \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.38566 \):

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{0.38566}{100} \approx 0.0038566 \, \text{per minute}.
\]

Next, we calculate the probability of decay over the next 150 minutes, \( P(150) \):

\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}
\]

Substituting \( \lambda \approx 0.0038566 \):

\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-0.0038566 \cdot 150}
\]

\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-0.57849}
\]

To compute \( e^{-0.57849} \), we approximate \( e^{-0.57849} \approx 0.56 \). Thus:

\[
P(150) = 1 - 0.56 = 0.44
\]

This corresponds to a 44% probability of decay over the next 150 minutes. Since the decay process is memoryless, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is the same regardless of the 50 minutes that have already passed.

From the given options:

- **A) 44%**
- **B) 40%**
- **C) 52%**
- **D) 48%**

The correct answer is **A) 44%**.

Okay, so I have this question about radioactive decay, and I need to find the probability that a particular atom will decay in the next 150 minutes given that it hasn't decayed for the first 50 minutes.

So, the survival probability at 200 is e^(-λ*200), and at 50 it's e^(-λ*50).

Let me write that down. Let's denote the decay probability in 100 minutes as P(100) = 32% or 0.32.

So,

P(100) = 1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32.

Solving for λ:

e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.

Take the natural logarithm of both sides:

-100λ = ln(0.68).

So,

λ = - ln(0.68)/100.

Calculate ln(0.68): ln(0.68) is approximately ln(2/3) is about -0.4055, but wait, 0.68 is a bit less than 2/3 (0.666...), so ln(0.68) is about -0.38566.

So,

λ ≈ 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Now, the question is asking for the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes. So, P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150).

Plugging in λ:

P(150) = 1 - e^(-0.0038566 * 150).

Compute 0.0038566 * 150: 0.0038566 * 150 ≈ 0.57849.

So, e^(-0.57849) is approximately e^-0.57849. Let's calculate that.

I remember that e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, and e^-0.6 is roughly 0.5488. So 0.57849 is between 0.5 and 0.6.

Compute more accurately: 0.57849.

We can use the approximation or a calculator, but perhaps I can remember that ln(2) is about 0.6931. So 0.57849 is about 0.6931 * 0.835. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, let's use a calculator approach.

e^-0.57849 ≈ 1/(e^0.57849).

Compute e^0.57849.

We know that e^0.5=1.6487, e^0.6=1.8221, e^0.57849 is about?

Let me think: 0.57849 is approximately 0.5 + 0.07849.

e^0.5 = 1.64872.

e^0.07849: we can approximate using the Taylor series.

e^x ≈ 1 + x + x²/2 + x^3/6.

x=0.07849.

x^2 ≈ 0.00616.

x^3≈ 0.000483.

So,

e^0.07849 ≈ 1 + 0.07849 + 0.00616/2 + 0.000483/6.

= 1.07849 + 0.00308 + 0.0000805.

≈ 1.08165.

So, e^0.57849 ≈ e^0.5 * e^0.07849 ≈ 1.64872 * 1.08165 ≈ let's compute that.

1.64872 * 1.08 = 1.64872 * 1 = 1.64872. 1.64872 * 0.08 = 0.131898. So total ~1.780618.

Then, 1.08165 is 0.00165 more. So 1.64872 * 0.00165 ≈ 0.00272. So total e^0.57849 ≈ approximately 1.7833.

But wait, perhaps more accurately, 1.64872 * 1.08165.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute 1.64872 * 1.08165:

1.64872 * 1 = 1.64872

1.64872 * 0.08 = 0.1318976

1.64872 * 0.00165 = approx 0.0027208.

Adding these up: 1.64872 + 0.1318976 = 1.7806176 + 0.0027208 ≈ 1.783338.

So e^0.57849 ≈ 1.7833.

So e^-0.57849 ≈ 1/1.7833 ≈ 0.56.

Wait, wait. 1.7833's reciprocal is approximately 0.56. Because 1.7833 * 0.56 ≈ 1. So e^-0.57849 ≈ 0.56.

But let me double-check. 1.7833 * 0.56 = ?

1.7833 * 0.5 = 0.89165

1.7833 * 0.06 = 0.106998

Adding, 0.89165 + 0.106998 ≈ 0.99865, which is close to 1. So 1.7833 * 0.56 ≈ 0.99865, which is very close to 1. So e^-0.57849 ≈ 0.56.

So, P(150) = 1 - 0.56 = 0.44, which is 44%.

Looking at the options, option A is 44%, so the answer would be A.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate it more accurately. Let me try to compute 0.0038566 * 150.

0.0038566 * 150 = 0.0038566 * 150 = 0.57849.

So, e^-0.57849 is about 0.56, as before.

So 1 - 0.56 = 0.44, 44% which is option A. So the probability is 44%.

Wait, but the answer isn't possible because the probability for 100 minutes is 32%, and 150 is longer than 100, so the probability should be higher than 32%. But 44% is higher, which makes sense. So yes, option A is 44%.


To determine the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, we use the exponential decay law. The decay probability is given by:

\[
P(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
\]

where \( \lambda \) is the decay constant and \( t \) is the time. From the problem, we know that the decay probability over 100 minutes is 32%, or \( P(100) = 0.32 \). Using this, we can calculate \( \lambda \):

\[
P(100) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 0.32
\]

\[
e^{-100\lambda} = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-100\lambda = \ln(0.68)
\]

\[
\lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100}
\]

Using \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.38566 \):

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{0.38566}{100} \approx 0.0038566 \, \text{per minute}.
\]

Next, we calculate the probability of decay over the next 150 minutes, \( P(150) \):

\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}
\]

Substituting \( \lambda \approx 0.0038566 \):

\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-0.0038566 \cdot 150}
\]

\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-0.57849}
\]

To compute \( e^{-0.57849} \), we approximate \( e^{-0.57849} \approx 0.56 \). Thus:

\[
P(150) = 1 - 0.56 = 0.44
\]

This corresponds to a 44% probability of decay over the next 150 minutes. Since the decay process is memoryless, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is the same regardless of the 50 minutes that have already passed.

From the given options:

- **A) 44%**
- **B) 40%**
- **C) 52%**
- **D) 48%**

The correct answer is **A) 44%**.

Answer: A
