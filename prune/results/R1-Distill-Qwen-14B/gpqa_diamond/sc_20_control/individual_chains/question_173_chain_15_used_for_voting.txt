Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Hmm, it's about the uncertainty principle, I think. Let me read it again.

The question says that an electron is moving at a speed of 2*10^8 m/s along the x-direction, and the uncertainty in its position, Δx, is 0.1 nm. We need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE. The options are A to D, with different exponents of 10 to the power of negative something.

Wait, I remember the uncertainty principle is from quantum mechanics. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, right? Which states that you can't simultaneously know both the position and momentum of a particle with absolute certainty. The more precisely you know one, the less precisely you can know the other.

The formula I think is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Oh wait, but sometimes people use the approximation without the ½ factor because it's just about the order of magnitude, so Δx * Δp ≈ ħ.

So I need to find Δp first. Once I have Δp, I can relate it to the uncertainty in energy. Because energy is related to momentum via E = p²/(2m), so the uncertainty in energy ΔE would be related to (Δp)^2/(2m). Or maybe I should think about the uncertainty in momentum leading to an uncertainty in kinetic energy.

Wait, let's break it down step by step.

First, calculate Δp. Given Δx = 0.1 nm, which is 0.1e-9 meters. Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So, using the uncertainty principle:

Δx * Δp ≈ ħ/2 → Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx)

Wait, but sometimes when people are estimating, they just use Δp ≈ ħ/Δx, so maybe we can ignore the 2 for an approximate calculation. Let me check: for order of magnitude, the 2 won't change the exponent much.

So, plugging the numbers in:

Δp ≈ ħ / Δx = (1.05e-34 J·s) / (0.1e-9 m) = 1.05e-34 / 1e-10 = 1.05e-24 kg·m/s.

Wait, wait, 0.1 nm is 1e-10 meters, right? No, wait: 1 nm is 1e-9 m, so 0.1 nm is 1e-10 m. So yes, that's correct.

So Δp is approximately 1e-24 kg·m/s.

Now, the energy uncertainty ΔE is related to the uncertainty in momentum. Since the electron's kinetic energy E is p²/(2m), the uncertainty in energy would be approximately (Δp)^2/(2m), where m is the mass of the electron.

The mass of the electron is about 9.11e-31 kg.

So, ΔE ≈ (Δp)^2/(2m) = (1e-24)^2 / (2 * 9.11e-31)

Let me compute that step by step.

(1e-24)^2 = 1e-48.

Denominator: 2 * 9.11e-31 ≈ 1.822e-30.

So, 1e-48 / 1.822e-30 ≈ (1/1.822) * 1e-18 ≈ 0.548 * 1e-18 ≈ 5.48e-19 J.

Hmm, wait, but wait, another approach: since we have Δp ≈ ħ/(Δx), then substituting into ΔE, which is p²/(2m), but since p is uncertain by Δp, the energy uncertainty ΔE would be (Δp)^2/(2m). So the calculation I did should be correct.

So, approximately 5.5e-19 J. Looking at the options, option C is ~1e-19 J. So that's the closest.

Wait, but wait, maybe I should consider that the minimum uncertainty is ħ/(2Δx) for Δp. Let me recalculate with the exact formula.

So Δp = ħ/(2Δx) = (1.05e-34)/(2 * 1e-10) = 1.05e-34 / 2e-10 = 5.25e-25 kg·m/s.

Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because 0.1 nm is 1e-10 m, but Δx is 0.1 nm = 1e-10 meters. So the correct calculation for Δp is ħ/(2Δx) = (1.05e-34)/(2 * 1e-10) = 1.05e-34 / 2e-10 = 5.25e-25 kg m/s.

Ah, I see. I forgot to account for the 2 in the denominator earlier. So my initial approximation without 2 was wrong. So let me redo the calculation.

So Δp = 5.25e-25 kg·m/s. Then, ΔE = (Δp)^2/(2m).

So (5.25e-25)^2 = (5.25)^2 * 1e-50 = approx 27.56 * 1e-50 = 2.756e-49.

Divide by 2m: 2 * 9.11e-31 = 1.822e-30.

So ΔE = 2.756e-49 / 1.822e-30 ≈ 1.512e-19 J.

So about 1.5e-19 J. Looking at the options, option C is ~1e-19 J, while option B is ~1e-17, which is two orders higher. Hmm, but wait, 1.5e-19 is closer to 1e-19 than 1e-18.

So the correct answer would be option C, ~1e-19 J.

Wait, but another thought: the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle gives the minimum uncertainty for ΔE. But perhaps an alternative approach using the standard uncertainty relation for energy and time is being considered here. Because in the question, the uncertainty in energy is related to the uncertainty in time.

Wait, no, the question says the uncertainty in position is Δx, so it's about the position uncertainty and the momentum uncertainty, which then relates to energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the kinetic energy accurately.

Wait, the kinetic energy E is (p^2)/(2m). The uncertainty in E would be roughly (Δp)^2/(2m). That's correct.

Wait, but wait, another approach: Using the time-energy uncertainty principle. But I don't think that's applicable here because the problem gives a position uncertainty, not a time uncertainty. So probably, the position and momentum uncertainty approach is correct.

So, putting it all together, the ΔE is approximately 1.5e-19 J, which is ~1e-19 J. So option C.

To estimate the minimum uncertainty in energy \( \Delta E \) of an electron, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the uncertainties in position (\( \Delta x \)) and momentum (\( \Delta p \)) as:

\[
\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant (\( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)). For an approximate calculation, we can write:

\[
\Delta p \approx \frac{\hbar}{\Delta x}.
\]

Given \( \Delta x = 0.1 \, \text{nm} = 1 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \), we calculate:

\[
\Delta p \approx \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{1 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 1.05 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
\]

Next, the uncertainty in energy \( \Delta E \) is related to the uncertainty in momentum \( \Delta p \) through the kinetic energy formula \( E = \frac{p^2}{2m} \). For the uncertainty, we use:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{(\Delta p)^2}{2m},
\]

where \( m \) is the mass of the electron (\( m \approx 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \)). Substituting \( \Delta p = 1.05 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{kg·m/s} \):

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{(1.05 \times 10^{-24})^2}{2 \times 9.11 \times 10^{-31}}.
\]

First, calculate \( (\Delta p)^2 \):

\[
(\Delta p)^2 = (1.05 \times 10^{-24})^2 = 1.10 \times 10^{-48}.
\]

Then, calculate the denominator:

\[
2m = 2 \times 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \approx 1.82 \times 10^{-30}.
\]

Now, divide:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{1.10 \times 10^{-48}}{1.82 \times 10^{-30}} \approx 6.04 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

This value is approximately \( 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \), which matches option C. The other options are orders of magnitude off: \( 10^{-18} \, \text{J} \) (too large), \( 10^{-17} \, \text{J} \) (too large), and \( 10^{-16} \, \text{J} \) (too large).

Thus, the minimum uncertainty in energy is closest to \( 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \).
