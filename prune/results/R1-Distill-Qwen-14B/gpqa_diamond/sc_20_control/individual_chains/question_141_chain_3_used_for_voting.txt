Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many possible organic products are formed when 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my reactions, but let me think this through.

First, I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation reactions, especially in aromatic substitution. Wait, but wait, 1-bromo is attached to the benzene ring. Oh wait, the compound is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Wait, wait, benzene rings are numbered such that the substituents get the lowest possible numbers. Oh wait, no, wait, the formula is 1-bromo-2-d something. Wait, maybe the "2-d" refers to a deuterium? Like, perhaps the benzene has a bromine at position 1, and a deuterium at position 2. Or maybe it's a typo and the structure is 1-bromo-2-dimethylamino benzene or something else? Hmm, maybe I need to clarify that.

Wait, the question is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Oh, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylbenzene. Or maybe it's 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene? Hmm, that could complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo and the structure is 1-bromo-2-dimethylamino benzene, but I'm not sure. Wait, in any case, maybe I should just proceed with what I know.

Wait, I think NaNH2 in condensed ammonia is a condition for elimination reactions, like for aromatic substitution, especially for dehydrohalogenation, forming rings with more unsaturation or aromatic rings.

Wait, but 1-bromobenzene is a bromobenzene derivative. So, when treated with a strong base like NaNH2 in ammonia, perhaps it undergoes aromatic substitution. Or maybe elimination.

Wait, wait, bromobenzene usually doesn't undergo elimination because the C-Br is only attached to the ring. So elimination would require adjacent H for E2, which isn't possible with just a single substituent. So maybe it's a nucleophilic aromatic substitution?

Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base, but it's also a good source of NH2- ions. In aromatic substitution, maybe the base abstracts a proton, making the ring more susceptible to substitution. Or perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a benzene ring with a double bond, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps this is a case of the benzene ring undergoing a substitution where the bromide leaves, and the NH2- acts as a nucleophile. But wait, aromatic nucleophilic substitution usually needs a strongly activating group. Bromide is an electron-withdrawing group, which makes the ring less reactive towards nucleophilic substitution. Hmm, but under strongly basic conditions, maybe it can happen.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more about dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not sure how that applies here.

Wait, another thought: maybe the bromide is in a position that allows for elimination, but that's more typical in aliphatic compounds. For example, vicinal dihalides can eliminate to form alkenes when treated with strong bases. But in this case, the structure is mono-halobenzene, so that's not applicable.

Wait, another possibility: The reaction could involve the benzene ring undergoing dehydrohalogenation to form a quinonoid structure, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Wait, maybe the "2-d" is a typo, and it's 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene, or perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene, meaning a bromine at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2.

Wait, but regardless, the reaction is with NaNH2 in ammonia. NaNH2 is a strong base, and in condensed ammonia, it's a polar aprotic solvent, which can facilitate elimination.

Wait, another angle: if the starting material is 1-bromobenzene, then treating it with a strong base like NaNH2 might lead to a substitution reaction. But wait, in aromatic substitution, the position of the incoming nucleophile depends on the directing groups. Bromide is a meta-directing group, but in nucleophilic substitution, maybe it's ortho/para. Wait, no, normally, bromide is electron-withdrawing, so it's meta directing for electrophilic substitution. But for nucleophilic substitution, since the ring is activated, perhaps the nucleophile attacks at ortho or para positions relative to the bromine.

Wait, but wait, NaNH2 provides NH2- ions, which are good nucleophiles. So perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. For that to happen, the ring should be strongly activated. But bromine is deactivating, making the ring less reactive. Hmm, perhaps under strongly basic conditions, the NH2- could deprotonate the ring, activating it for substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, forming a benzene ring with a double bond and maybe another substituent.

Wait, perhaps the bromide leaves, and the ring becomes more deprotonated, leading to a triple bond? That seems unlikely.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a substitution where the NH2- replaces the Br. So the product would be 1-amino-2-d benzene, but wait, the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d (maybe a deuterium). Hmm, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromide leaves, and the ring loses a hydrogen to form a benzene with an amino group. But I'm not quite sure.

Wait, another approach: think about the possible positions where substitution can occur. The starting material is 1-bromo-2-something benzene. So, the bromine is in position 1, and another substituent (maybe deuterium) is in position 2.

If the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution, the incoming NH2- would attack either the ortho, meta, or para positions relative to the Br. But wait, in mono-bromobenzene, the substitution typically occurs at the para position, but bromine is meta-directing. Oh, but wait, wait, no, that's for electrophilic substitution. For nucleophilic substitution on a deactivating group, the positions are different.

Wait, perhaps under strongly basic conditions, the ring is deprotonated at the ortho or para positions, making the ring more susceptible to attack. So, when the NH2- attacks, it would add at those positions.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about what NaNH2 does in similar reactions. Oh right, in the case of benzene rings with strong electron-withdrawing groups, NaNH2 can induce elimination to form an aromatic ring with a triple bond, such as in the formation of benzenediazonium salts, but I'm not sure.

Wait, wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but since it's a benzene ring, that might not be feasible. Alternatively, perhaps the bromide leaves, and the NH2- acts as a base abstracting a proton, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with an amino group and a hydrogen abstraction leading to a ring expansion or something else. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more about elimination, but in this case, perhaps it's a benzidine-like elimination, but that's more for certain disubstituted benzene rings.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene, and the reaction is a substitution where the Br is replaced by NH2. So the product would have NH2 in position 1, and the deuterium in position 2. But that's a single product. So the number of products would be one.

But wait, wait, wait. Maybe the elimination forms a ring with more unsaturation. Let's say, the Br is removed and a double bond is formed. So if the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene, maybe the elimination leads to a benzene ring with a double bond between C1 and C2. But wait, benzene is already a six-membered ring with three double bonds. Wait, perhaps that's not feasible. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination forms a quinone structure, but that's more for dihalobenzenes.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a coupling reaction, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the NH2- replaces the Br. So the product would have NH2 in position 1. But since there's a deuterium in position 2, perhaps that doesn't affect the substitution. So that would give one product.

Wait, but wait, maybe the deuterium affects the reaction. For example, if the ring is deprotonated at position 2 (since it's a deuterium, which is less acidic than H?), but I'm not sure. Or perhaps the deuterium is just a substituent that directs the attack.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of an amino group in either the para or ortho positions relative to the Br. But since the Br is in position 1, the para position would be position 4, and the ortho would be positions 2 and 6. But wait, position 2 already has the deuterium. So if substitution occurs at position 2, it's possible but maybe not favored.

Wait, maybe the substitution can occur at either the para or ortho positions. But in the para position, position 4, which is available. So then, we have two possible products: substitution at position 4 (para) and substitution at position 6 (another ortho position). But wait, position 2 already has a deuterium, so substitution there would be unlikely.

Wait, but in mono-bromobenzene, the substitution occurs para to the Br. So if Br is at 1, the NH2 would go to 4. But wait, could it also go to 2 or 6? Well, the Br is a meta-directing group, so in electrophilic substitution, the incoming group would go to 3 or 5. But wait, in nucleophilic substitution, it's different.

Wait, no, in nucleophilic aromatic substitution, the nucleophile attacks the position that's most activated, which is typically the position where the ring has the highest electron density. Since Br is an electron-withdrawing group, the ring is less activated, but under strong basic conditions, perhaps the ring is deprotonated, which can activate certain positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is elimination, leading to a benzene ring with a triple bond, but I'm not sure how that would proceed.

Wait, perhaps I should look for similar reactions. Oh! I remember that NaNH2 in ammonia is used to dehydrohalogenate aryl halides to form aryl alkenes. Wait, but how?

Wait, another reaction I recall is the formation of benzynes. For example, when 1-bromo-2-iodobenzene is treated with NaNH2, it can eliminate two equivalents of HX to form a benzyne intermediate. But that's for dihalobenzenes. In our case, it's only a mono-bromobenzene, so perhaps elimination isn't possible.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the bromide leaves, and the ring loses a hydrogen from an adjacent position, but since it's a benzene ring, there's no adjacent hydrogen in a position that would allow for that. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, each carbon is bonded to two others.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to outline what's possible.

1. The starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene. I'm not entirely clear about the substituent in position 2, but for the sake of this problem, let's assume it's a deuterium—so 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene.

2. Treating with NaNH2 in ammonia. NaNH2 is a strong base and a source of NH2-.

3. What reactions are possible here?

Option A: Nucleophilic aromatic substitution. The NH2- replaces the Br. Since Br is in position 1, the NH2 would go into position 1, leading to 1-amino-2-d benzene.

But in nucleophilic substitution, the attacking nucleophile usually enters at a position that's activated. Since Br is a meta director, perhaps the substitution occurs at position 3 or 5. But wait, but wait, the ring is deactivating, so maybe it's difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps the deprotonation occurs at position 2 (which has a deuterium), making it less acidic than H, but I'm not sure. If position 2 is deuterated, maybe it's harder for the base to abstract a proton there, so deprotonation at other positions occurs.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton at position 4, making the ring more activated for substitution. Wait, but I'm not certain.

Another thought: perhaps the deuterium is in position 2, making the ring less reactive in certain positions. But I'm not sure how that affects substitution.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction doesn't involve substitution but elimination. Wait, but elimination usually requires two adjacent leaving groups or H's. I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is more about the formation of aniline. So, when NaNH2 is used with aryl halides in ammonia, sometimes it's a method to form anilines via substitution. So, the bromide would be replaced by an amino group. So the product would be 1-amino-2-d benzene. But how many products would that be? Just one, so option B)1.

But wait, wait a minute. Could there be multiple products due to different substitution positions?

Wait, but in the case of monosubstituted benzene rings undergoing substitution, the incoming group typically ends up in either the ortho, meta, or para positions relative to the existing substituent. But for nucleophilic substitution, the directing effects are different.

Wait, wait, but in nucleophilic aromatic substitution, the nucleophile attacks the position that's most activated, which is often the position where the ring has the highest electron density. Since the ring is deactivated by the Br, but perhaps the base deprotonates the ring, activating certain positions.

But perhaps in this case, substitution only occurs at the para position, leading to a single product. So the answer would be option B)1.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a benzene ring with an amino group in position 4, and the deuterium remains in position 2, giving only one product.

But let me think again: is there any possibility of more than one product?

Perhaps I'm missing something about the structure. If the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene, and the reaction is substitution, the NH2- can attack either the para position (4) or maybe the ortho positions (2 and 6). But position 2 has a deuterium, which might not leave, so substitution there is unlikely. So the NH2 would go to position 4, giving one product.

Wait, but if the deuterium in position 2 affects the substitution, perhaps the para position is not as activated, leading the substitution to occur elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe the deuterium doesn't affect the substitution much, so substitution occurs only at the para position.

Alternatively, perhaps the deuterium is in position 2, and the substitution occurs at position 4, giving a single product.

So in that case, the number of products would be 1, which is option B.

Wait, but wait, another possibility: maybe the reaction leads to multiple products because of steric or electronic factors allowing substitution at more than one position.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to a meta substitution, but given that the Br is meta-directing, but for nucleophilic substitution, the directing effects are different. Hmm.

Wait, nucleophilic aromatic substitution typically occurs when the ring is strongly activated towards nucleophilic attack. Since Br is deactivating, perhaps the reaction isn't feasible except under very strong conditions. But NaNH2 is a strong base, so maybe the ring is deprotonated, making it more reactive.

Wait, if the ring is deprotonated at positions ortho or para to the Br, that could activate those positions for nucleophilic attack.

So, when the base (NH2-) abstracts a proton, it could do so at position 2 (but it's a deuterium, so maybe not), position 4, or position 6.

If the ring is deprotonated at position 4, then the NH2- could attack at that position, leading to substitution at 4. Alternatively, if the ring is deprotonated at position 6, substitution could occur there.

Wait, but wait, position 2 has a deuterium, so it's not a proton available for deprotonation. So the base might deprotonate positions 4 or 6, making those positions more susceptible to attack.

So substitution could occur at either position 4 or 6, leading to two possible products: 4-amino and 6-amino derivatives. But wait, in benzene, positions 4 and 6 are actually the same due to symmetry. Wait, no. Because the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene, the positions are fixed. Let me imagine the ring: position 1 is Br, position 2 is D. So the ring would look like:

Positions:
1 (Br)
2 (D)
3
4
5
6

So, the ring has Br at 1, D at 2. Then, positions 3 and 5 are adjacent to D. Position 4 is opposite Br, position 6 is adjacent to Br.

Wait, but wait, for substitution, the NH2- would attack either at position 4 (para to Br) or at position 6 (ortho to Br, but adjacent to position 1). But position 6 is adjacent to Br, so that's an ortho position.

But in nucleophilic substitution, the nucleophile attacks the position that's most activated. So if the ring is deprotonated at position 4, then substitution occurs there. If it's deprotonated at position 6, substitution occurs there.

Wait, but in this case, the ring has substituents at positions 1 and 2. So, the para position to Br (position 1) is position 4, which is two positions away. The ortho positions to Br are 2 and 6. But position 2 is already occupied by D, so substitution can't occur there.

So the possible positions for substitution are 4 and 6. But position 6 is adjacent to Br, which is an ortho position. But wait, substitution in aromatic rings is more likely to occur para to the meta-directing groups. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substitution occurs at position 4 as the major product, but if there's another possible position, like 6, then there could be two products.

Wait, but wait another thing: in a benzene ring, positions 4 and 6 are not equivalent in this case because position 2 has a D. So if substitution occurs at 4 and 6, would they be distinct products?

Let me draw this out mentally. If Br is at 1, D at 2. Then position 4 is across from Br, position 6 is adjacent to Br but on the other side.

So, substitution at 4 would give a structure with Br at 1, D at 2, and NH2 at 4. Substitution at 6 would give Br at 1, D at 2, and NH2 at 6.

But wait, in the benzene ring, positions 4 and 6 are actually adjacent to each other. So substitution at 4 and 6 would result in two different products because their positions are distinct relative to the substituents.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the ring's symmetry leads to the same product when substituting at 4 and 6. Let me think: if I rotate the ring, does substitution at 4 and 6 lead to identical structures?

No, because position 2 is fixed with D, so substituting at 4 and 6 would result in different structures. Therefore, substitution at 4 and 6 would lead to two different products.

Wait, but wait, no. Because in the starting material, position 2 is D. So when substitution occurs at position 4, the structure is 1-Br, 2-D, 4-NH2. When substitution occurs at position 6, the structure is 1-Br, 2-D, 6-NH2.

But in a benzene ring, positions 4 and 6 are across from each other, but relative to the substituents, they are different. So these would be two distinct products.

Thus, if substitution occurs at both positions 4 and 6, we get two products. But wait, is substitution only possible at one position?

Alternatively, perhaps the base can abstract a proton from either position 4 or 6, leading to substitution at either position.

But I'm not certain. Let me think about the mechanism. For nucleophilic aromatic substitution, the ring must be activated. So, when the base (NaNH2) deprotonates the ring, it creates a strong activating group (like a carbanion), which allows the NH2- to attack.

In this case, the ring has Br at 1 and D at 2. So, the possible sites for deprotonation would be positions 3, 4, 5, and 6. But position 2 is D, so position 1 (Br) is adjacent to positions 6 and 2, which is D.

If the base deprotonates position 4, then the NH2- can attack position 4, giving 1-Br, 2-D, 4-NH2.

If the base deprotonates position 6, then the NH2- can attack position 6, giving 1-Br, 2-D, 6-NH2.

Additionally, could the base deprotonate position 3 or 5? Let's see.

Position 3 is adjacent to D (position 2). Position 5 is adjacent to position 4. Hmm, perhaps the acidity of protons in positions 4 and 6 is higher, making them more likely to be deprotonated.

So, if substitution occurs at both 4 and 6, that's two products. So the number of possible products would be two, which is option C.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed via substitution but elimination. Let's think again.

If elimination occurs, perhaps we lose H and Br, forming a double bond between positions 1 and 2. But the ring is already a benzene, which has three double bonds. So that might not be feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a ring with a triple bond, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a benzene ring with an amino group in position 4 and deuterium in position 2, leading to a single product. But if substitution can occur in two different positions, then two products.

So, putting it all together, the possible products are substitution at position 4 and substitution at position 6. So two products in total. Therefore, the answer is option C)2.


--- Final Answer Content ---


When 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia solvent, the reaction involves nucleophilic aromatic substitution. NaNH₂ provides NH₂⁻ ions, which act as nucleophiles, and the strong basic conditions facilitate deprotonation of the aromatic ring, activating it for substitution. The starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, has bromine at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2.

Bromine is an electron-withdrawing group, making the ring less reactive toward nucleophilic substitution. However, under the strongly basic conditions of NaNH₂ in ammonia, the ring can be deprotonated at positions ortho or para to the bromine, creating a carbanion intermediate that is highly susceptible to nucleophilic attack by NH₂⁻.

The possible positions for substitution are:
1. **Position 4 (para to bromine)**: This is the most likely position for substitution due to the activating effect of the carbanion formed at position 4.
2. **Position 6 (ortho to bromine)**: Substitution at position 6 is also possible, as the carbanion formed at position 6 can also react with NH₂⁻.

Substitution at position 4 results in 1-amino-2-d benzene, while substitution at position 6 results in 1-bromo-2-d-6-aminobenzene. These are two distinct products because the positions of the amino group relative to the bromine and deuterium are different. Therefore, the reaction produces two possible organic products.
