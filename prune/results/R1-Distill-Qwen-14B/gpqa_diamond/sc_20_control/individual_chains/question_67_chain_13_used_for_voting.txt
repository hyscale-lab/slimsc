Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, we've got two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. The problem says to ignore their spin angular momentum, which probably means we're focusing on their orbital angular momentum only. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. Hmm, I remember that when you couple two angular momenta, the state is written in terms of the individual quantum numbers and their total.

Wait, so the notation |l1, l2, l, m> must represent the state where the first electron has orbital angular momentum quantum number l1, the second has l2, and together their total angular momentum is l with m being the projection along the z-axis. So in this case, l1 is 1, l2 is 1, so their total l is 2, and m is -1.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z of each electron. They want the joint probability that both measurements give eigenvalues of -ħ. So, each Lz measurement should yield -ħ for both electrons.

Wait, but wait—orbital angular momentum for an electron in a p orbital. The p orbital has l=1, so the possible m values are -1, 0, +1. So each electron's Lz can be -ħ, 0, or +ħ.

But in the coupled state |1,1,2,-1>, what does that imply about the possible individual m1 and m2 values? Because the total m is m1 + m2. So the total m here is -1. So m1 + m2 = -1.

Wait, m is the z-component of the total angular momentum, which is the sum of the individual m's. So for each electron, their individual m's (m1 and m2) add up to the total m, which is -1.

The possible m1 and m2 values for each electron are each -1, 0, +1. So the possible pairs (m1, m2) that sum to -1 are:

-1 and 0: (-1) + 0 = -1.
0 and -1: 0 + (-1) = -1.
Also, -2 would require one of the m's to be -2, but wait, each electron can only have m = -1, 0, +1. So the only possibilities are the two cases above.

Wait, but the question is about both L1z and L2z being measured as -ħ. That would mean m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. Because Lz eigenvalues are mħ. So if m1 = -1, then L1z = -ħ. Similarly for m2.

But wait, in our total state, the sum m1 + m2 is -1. If both m1 and m2 are -1, their sum would be -2, which doesn't match the total m of -1 in the state. So this situation can't happen. Therefore, the probability is zero.

But wait, let me make sure. The state is |l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1>. So the state is an eigenstate of L^2, Lz, but not necessarily of the individual L1z and L2z.

In the coupled basis, the state is a linear combination of the uncoupled states, which are the direct product of the individual states. So the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> can be expressed as a sum of |m1, m2> states where m1 + m2 = -1.

So what are the possible |m1, m2> states that contribute to this coupled state? Well, they have to have m1 + m2 = -1. So the possible (m1, m2) pairs are:

(-1, 0), (0, -1).

Wait, but wait, no, let's compute all possible pairs where m1 + m2 = -1. Each m can be -1, 0, +1.

So possibilities:

m1 = -1, m2 = 0 → sum is -1.

m1 = 0, m2 = -1 → sum is -1.

m1 = -2 → but wait, each electron can't have m less than -1. So those are the only two possibilities.

So in the coupled state |1,1,2,-1>, the state is a linear combination of these two |m1,m2> states: |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

Hmm, but wait, how does the coupling work? For two angular momenta l1 and l2, the coupled states are formed by Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The state |l1 l2 L M> is a linear combination of |l1 m1> |l2 m2>, where m1 + m2 = M.

So in this case, M is -1, so the only possible pairs are m1=-1 and m2=0, or m1=0 and m2=-1.

So the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> can be written as a combination of these two product states.

But wait, what about the coefficients? Because the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are involved. Let me think: for L=2 and M=-1, the state is a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

Wait, but are these the only possibilities? Or is there another combination? Let me think about the possible m1 and m2 states that can contribute.

Wait, for M=-1, the possible (m1, m2) are:

(-1, 0), (0, -1). Because 1 + (-2) isn't possible since m can't be less than -1.

So in the coupled state, it's a superposition of these two states.

So when you measure L1z and L2z, you're essentially projecting the state onto the product states |m1, m2>, which are eigenstates of L1z and L2z.

In our case, the coupled state is a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

Therefore, the probability of each of these is the square of their respective coefficients.

But wait, let's think about the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for this case. The state |l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1> can be expressed as:

|1,1,2,-1> = sqrt( ( (2 - ( -1 +1 )) ) / ( (2 +1)(2) )) ) * |m1=-1, m2=0> + sqrt( ( (2 - ( 0 -1 )) ) / ( (2+1)(2) )) ) * |m1=0, m2=-1> ?

Wait, perhaps it's better to look up the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding two l=1 states to get L=2, M=-1.

I remember that Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding l1 and l2 to get L, M are given by:

|l1 m1> |l2 m2> → sum over m_CG |L M> multiplied by CG coefficients.

Alternatively, the expansion of |L M> in terms of |l1 m1> |l2 m2> is via CG coefficients.

But perhaps I can find the specific coefficients for this case.

The general formula for CG coefficients when adding two angular momenta l1 and l2 to get L and M is non-trivial, but in some cases, like when l1=l2=1 and L=2, the states can be written as combinations.

For L=2, M=2: only possible when m1=1 and m2=1.

For M=1: possible from (m1=1, m2=0) and (m1=0, m2=1).

For M=0: possible from (m1=1, m2=-1), (m1=0, m2=0), (m1=-1, m2=1).

For M=-1: possible from (m1=0, m2=-1) and (m1=-1, m2=0).

For M=-2: m1=-1, m2=-1.

So for our case, M=-1, the coupled state is a combination of |m1=0, m2=-1> and |m1=-1, m2=0>.

The CG coefficients for these are sqrt( ( (L - m1 + m2) ( ... )) ), but perhaps it's easier to just know that each term has a coefficient of 1/sqrt(2), since there are two terms contributing.

Wait, wait, for M=-1 in L=2, the expansion is:

|1,1,2,-1> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ |m1=0, m2=-1> + |m1=-1, m2=0> ].

Wait, no, maybe it's (1/sqrt(2)) times [ |m1=0, m2=-1> + |m1=-1, m2=0> ].

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact signs. But for this problem, maybe the exact coefficients aren't necessary, because the question is about the joint probability of both electrons having m=-1 (i.e., their Lz eigenvalues being -ħ). But as we saw earlier, m1 and m2 can't both be -1 because their sum would be -2, but the total M is -1. So the only possible states in the coupled state are (0, -1) and (-1, 0), which sum to M=-1.

So in the coupled state |1,1,2,-1>, the state is a superposition of |0, -1> and |-1, 0>, each multiplied by some coefficient.

So when you measure L1z and L2z, you are projecting onto the |m1, m2> basis states. The possible outcomes are:

Case 1: m1=0, m2=-1 → L1z = 0*ħ, L2z = (-1)*ħ.

Case 2: m1=-1, m2=0 → L1z = (-1)*ħ, L2z = 0*ħ.

So in both cases, only one of the electrons has Lz = -ħ, the other has 0. But the question asks for both electrons to have Lz = -ħ, meaning m1 = m2 = -1.

But wait, can that happen? Because in the coupled state, the only possible components are those where m1 + m2 = -1. If m1 = -1 and m2 = -1, then m1 + m2 = -2, which doesn't equal M=-1. So these states aren't present in the coupled state.

Therefore, the probability of measuring m1 = -1 and m2 = -1 is zero. Because the coupled state doesn't include any component of | -1, -1 >.

So the joint probability is zero.

Looking at the options, option D is 0.

The problem involves two electrons in a coupled angular momentum state $|1,1,2,-1>$, where $l_1 = 1$, $l_2 = 1$, $L = 2$, and $M = -1$. The goal is to determine the joint probability of measuring the orbital angular momentum components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$ for both electrons.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Coupled State Interpretation**:  
   The coupled state $|1,1,2,-1>$ represents a superposition of the uncoupled states $|m_1, m_2>$, where $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the individual $z$-components of angular momentum for the two electrons. These states must satisfy the condition $m_1 + m_2 = M = -1$.

2. **Possible $(m_1, m_2)$ Pairs**:  
   For $m_1 + m_2 = -1$, the possible pairs are:
   - $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, 0)$
   - $(m_1, m_2) = (0, -1)$

   These pairs are the only contributions to the coupled state $|1,1,2,-1>$.

3. **Measurement of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$**:  
   Measuring $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ corresponds to projecting the state onto the $|m_1, m_2>$ basis. The question asks for the joint probability of both electrons having $L_{1z} = -\hbar$ and $L_{2z} = -\hbar$, which implies $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.

4. **Impossibility of $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$**:  
   If $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$, their sum would be $m_1 + m_2 = -2$, which does not match the total $M = -1$ of the coupled state. Therefore, the state $|m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1>$ is not part of the coupled state $|1,1,2,-1>$.

5. **Conclusion**:  
   Since the coupled state does not include any component where both $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$, the joint probability of measuring $L_{1z} = -\hbar$ and $L_{2z} = -\hbar$ is **zero**.

### Final Answer:
The joint probability is $0$.  
**Answer: D**

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, we've got two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. The problem says to ignore their spin angular momentum, which probably means we're focusing on their orbital angular momentum only. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. Hmm, I remember that when you couple two angular momenta, the state is written in terms of the individual quantum numbers and their total.

Wait, so the notation |l1, l2, l, m> must represent the state where the first electron has orbital angular momentum quantum number l1, the second has l2, and together their total angular momentum is l with m being the projection along the z-axis. So in this case, l1 is 1, l2 is 1, so their total l is 2, and m is -1.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z of each electron. They want the joint probability that both measurements give eigenvalues of -ħ. So, each Lz measurement should yield -ħ for both electrons.

Wait, but wait—orbital angular momentum for an electron in a p orbital. The p orbital has l=1, so the possible m values are -1, 0, +1. So each electron's Lz can be -ħ, 0, or +ħ.

But in the coupled state |1,1,2,-1>, what does that imply about the possible individual m1 and m2 values? Because the total m is m1 + m2. So the total m here is -1. So m1 + m2 = -1.

Wait, m is the z-component of the total angular momentum, which is the sum of the individual m's. So for each electron, their individual m's (m1 and m2) add up to the total m, which is -1.

The possible m1 and m2 values for each electron are each -1, 0, +1. So the possible pairs (m1, m2) that sum to -1 are:

-1 and 0: (-1) + 0 = -1.
0 and -1: 0 + (-1) = -1.
Also, -2 would require one of the m's to be -2, but wait, each electron can only have m = -1, 0, +1. So the only possibilities are the two cases above.

Wait, but the question is about both L1z and L2z being measured as -ħ. That would mean m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. Because Lz eigenvalues are mħ. So if m1 = -1, then L1z = -ħ. Similarly for m2.

But wait, in our total state, the sum m1 + m2 is -1. If both m1 and m2 are -1, their sum would be -2, which doesn't match the total m of -1 in the state. So this situation can't happen. Therefore, the probability is zero.

But wait, let me make sure. The state is |l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1>. So the state is an eigenstate of L^2, Lz, but not necessarily of the individual L1z and L2z.

In the coupled basis, the state is a linear combination of the uncoupled states, which are the direct product of the individual states. So the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> can be expressed as a sum of |m1, m2> states where m1 + m2 = -1.

So what are the possible |m1, m2> states that contribute to this coupled state? Well, they have to have m1 + m2 = -1. So the possible (m1, m2) pairs are:

(-1, 0), (0, -1).

Wait, but wait, no, let's compute all possible pairs where m1 + m2 = -1. Each m can be -1, 0, +1.

So possibilities:

m1 = -1, m2 = 0 → sum is -1.

m1 = 0, m2 = -1 → sum is -1.

m1 = -2 → but wait, each electron can't have m less than -1. So those are the only two possibilities.

So in the coupled state |1,1,2,-1>, the state is a linear combination of these two |m1,m2> states: |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

Hmm, but wait, how does the coupling work? For two angular momenta l1 and l2, the coupled states are formed by Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The state |l1 l2 L M> is a linear combination of |l1 m1> |l2 m2>, where m1 + m2 = M.

So in this case, M is -1, so the only possible pairs are m1=-1 and m2=0, or m1=0 and m2=-1.

So the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> can be written as a combination of these two product states.

But wait, what about the coefficients? Because the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are involved. Let me think: for L=2 and M=-1, the state is a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

Wait, but are these the only possibilities? Or is there another combination? Let me think about the possible m1 and m2 states that can contribute.

Wait, for M=-1, the possible (m1, m2) are:

(-1, 0), (0, -1). Because 1 + (-2) isn't possible since m can't be less than -1.

So in the coupled state, it's a superposition of these two states.

So when you measure L1z and L2z, you're essentially projecting the state onto the product states |m1, m2>, which are eigenstates of L1z and L2z.

In our case, the coupled state is a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

Therefore, the probability of each of these is the square of their respective coefficients.

But wait, let's think about the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for this case. The state |l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1> can be expressed as:

|1,1,2,-1> = sqrt( ( (2 - ( -1 +1 )) ) / ( (2 +1)(2) )) ) * |m1=-1, m2=0> + sqrt( ( (2 - ( 0 -1 )) ) / ( (2+1)(2) )) ) * |m1=0, m2=-1> ?

Wait, perhaps it's better to look up the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding two l=1 states to get L=2, M=-1.

I remember that Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding l1 and l2 to get L, M are given by:

|l1 m1> |l2 m2> → sum over m_CG |L M> multiplied by CG coefficients.

Alternatively, the expansion of |L M> in terms of |l1 m1> |l2 m2> is via CG coefficients.

But perhaps I can find the specific coefficients for this case.

The general formula for CG coefficients when adding two angular momenta l1 and l2 to get L and M is non-trivial, but in some cases, like when l1=l2=1 and L=2, the states can be written as combinations.

For L=2, M=2: only possible when m1=1 and m2=1.

For M=1: possible from (m1=1, m2=0) and (m1=0, m2=1).

For M=0: possible from (m1=1, m2=-1), (m1=0, m2=0), (m1=-1, m2=1).

For M=-1: possible from (m1=0, m2=-1) and (m1=-1, m2=0).

For M=-2: m1=-1, m2=-1.

So for our case, M=-1, the coupled state is a combination of |m1=0, m2=-1> and |m1=-1, m2=0>.

The CG coefficients for these are sqrt( ( (L - m1 + m2) ( ... )) ), but perhaps it's easier to just know that each term has a coefficient of 1/sqrt(2), since there are two terms contributing.

Wait, wait, for M=-1 in L=2, the expansion is:

|1,1,2,-1> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ |m1=0, m2=-1> + |m1=-1, m2=0> ].

Wait, no, maybe it's (1/sqrt(2)) times [ |m1=0, m2=-1> + |m1=-1, m2=0> ].

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact signs. But for this problem, maybe the exact coefficients aren't necessary, because the question is about the joint probability of both electrons having m=-1 (i.e., their Lz eigenvalues being -ħ). But as we saw earlier, m1 and m2 can't both be -1 because their sum would be -2, but the total M is -1. So the only possible states in the coupled state are (0, -1) and (-1, 0), which sum to M=-1.

So in the coupled state |1,1,2,-1>, the state is a superposition of |0, -1> and |-1, 0>, each multiplied by some coefficient.

So when you measure L1z and L2z, you are projecting onto the |m1, m2> basis states. The possible outcomes are:

Case 1: m1=0, m2=-1 → L1z = 0*ħ, L2z = (-1)*ħ.

Case 2: m1=-1, m2=0 → L1z = (-1)*ħ, L2z = 0*ħ.

So in both cases, only one of the electrons has Lz = -ħ, the other has 0. But the question asks for both electrons to have Lz = -ħ, meaning m1 = m2 = -1.

But wait, can that happen? Because in the coupled state, the only possible components are those where m1 + m2 = -1. If m1 = -1 and m2 = -1, then m1 + m2 = -2, which doesn't equal M=-1. So these states aren't present in the coupled state.

Therefore, the probability of measuring m1 = -1 and m2 = -1 is zero. Because the coupled state doesn't include any component of | -1, -1 >.

So the joint probability is zero.

Looking at the options, option D is 0.


The problem involves two electrons in a coupled angular momentum state $|1,1,2,-1>$, where $l_1 = 1$, $l_2 = 1$, $L = 2$, and $M = -1$. The goal is to determine the joint probability of measuring the orbital angular momentum components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$ for both electrons.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Coupled State Interpretation**:  
   The coupled state $|1,1,2,-1>$ represents a superposition of the uncoupled states $|m_1, m_2>$, where $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the individual $z$-components of angular momentum for the two electrons. These states must satisfy the condition $m_1 + m_2 = M = -1$.

2. **Possible $(m_1, m_2)$ Pairs**:  
   For $m_1 + m_2 = -1$, the possible pairs are:
   - $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, 0)$
   - $(m_1, m_2) = (0, -1)$

   These pairs are the only contributions to the coupled state $|1,1,2,-1>$.

3. **Measurement of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$**:  
   Measuring $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ corresponds to projecting the state onto the $|m_1, m_2>$ basis. The question asks for the joint probability of both electrons having $L_{1z} = -\hbar$ and $L_{2z} = -\hbar$, which implies $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.

4. **Impossibility of $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$**:  
   If $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$, their sum would be $m_1 + m_2 = -2$, which does not match the total $M = -1$ of the coupled state. Therefore, the state $|m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1>$ is not part of the coupled state $|1,1,2,-1>$.

5. **Conclusion**:  
   Since the coupled state does not include any component where both $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$, the joint probability of measuring $L_{1z} = -\hbar$ and $L_{2z} = -\hbar$ is **zero**.
