Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let's see, the question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, I remember orthophosphate is PO4^3- right? So the problem gives me some information: the solution is 200 cm³ (which is 0.2 liters), and it contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molar masses are given as 136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol respectively. Oh, and the temperatures are at 25°C.

Wait, and the question gives the Ka values for H3PO4: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. So H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, meaning it can donate three protons. Right, each dissociation step has its own Ka.

So the solution has two different phosphate salts. KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, I think. And Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate with two waters of crystallization. Wait, but Na2HPO4 is sodium dihydrogen phosphate, no? Or wait, maybe Na2HPO4 is sodium hydrogen phosphate. Hmm, I might need to clarify that.

Wait, the formula for Na2HPO4 is Na2HPO4, which means it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. So HPO4^2- is the dihydrogen phosphate ion. While KH2PO4 would dissociate into K+ and H2PO4^-.

So in solution, we have H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 and HPO4^2- from the sodium salt. Since H2PO4^- can act as an acid (losing a proton to become HPO4^2-) or as a base (gaining a proton to become H3PO4), but in this case, considering the pH, I think the solution is a buffer solution because we have two different phosphate species.

Wait, the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which are PO4^3-. But in the solution, we don't have any PO4^3- directly. Oh wait, maybe the phosphate species present are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and under certain conditions, they can deprotonate further to form PO4^3-.

But given the Ka values, let's see. The steps of H3PO4 dissociation are:

H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- ; Ka1=7.5e-3

H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- ; Ka2=6.2e-8

HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- ; Ka3=1.8e-12

So, the pH of the solution will determine which species are present. Since we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution, I think the pH is between the pKa2 and pKa3 or somewhere else. Wait, but wait: the solution is a mixture of a weak acid (H2PO4^-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-). So that would make a buffer solution. So the pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

But wait, I'm trying to find the concentration of PO4^3- ions. Oh, wait, but I don't think any of the given salts directly contribute PO4^3- ions. So unless HPO4^2- deprotonates further, which would require a very high pH, but considering the Ka3 is very small (1.8e-12), it's unlikely that significant PO4^3- is present unless the solution is very basic.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is such that some of the HPO4^2- can accept a proton to form H2PO4^-, but that's the reverse of the second dissociation.

Wait, the solution is made by mixing a salt that provides H2PO4^- (KH2PO4) and a salt that provides HPO4^2- (Na2HPO4). So H2PO4^- is a weak acid, and HPO4^2- is its conjugate base. So the pH of the solution would be around the pKa2 of H3PO4, which is log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.21. Because pKa2 is about 7.21. So the pH of this buffer solution should be around that value. Since pKa2 is ~7.21, the solution is likely slightly basic because Na2HPO4 is the conjugate base.

Wait, but if the solution is at pH around 7.2, which is higher than pKa2, so more HPO4^2- would be present than H2PO4^-.

But wait, the problem is asking for the concentration of PO4^3- ions. So I need to find [PO4^3-].

But given that the pH is around 7.2, which is higher than pKa2 (7.21), the HPO4^2- is the predominant form. But for PO4^3- to form, the solution's pH needs to be higher than pKa3, which is around 11.74 (since Ka3 is 1.8e-12, so pKa3 is log(1.8e-12) ≈ 11.74). But the solution's pH is only around 7.2, which is much lower than 11.74. So that would mean that HPO4^2- is the major species, and very little PO4^3- is formed. Therefore, the concentration of PO4^3- would be very low, on the order of 1e-7 or similar.

Wait, but how can I calculate the exact concentration of PO4^3-?

I think I should approach this step by step.

First, find the moles of each salt in the solution.

Calculating moles:

Moles of KH2PO4 = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007339 mol.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005610 mol.

So, moles of H2PO4^- from KH2PO4: 0.007339 mol.

Moles of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4: 0.005610 mol.

So total volume is 0.2 L.

Concentrations:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007339 / 0.2 ≈ 0.036695 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005610 / 0.2 ≈ 0.02805 M.

Now, since these two are a conjugate acid-base pair with Ka2 = 6.2e-8, which is for H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2-.

So according to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa2 + log([base]/[acid])

Here, [base] is [HPO4^2-], and [acid] is [H2PO4^-].

pKa2 = log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.207.

So:

pH = 7.207 + log(0.02805 / 0.036695 )

Calculating the ratio: 0.02805 / 0.036695 ≈ 0.7645.

Log(0.7645) ≈ -0.115.

So pH ≈ 7.207 - 0.115 ≈ 7.092.

So the solution's pH is approximately 7.09.

Now, I need to find [PO4^3-]. To get PO4^3-, HPO4^2- must lose a proton. But the pH is 7.09, which is below pKa3 (~11.74). So in this case, the reverse reaction is favored, meaning HPO4^2- is more likely to gain a proton to become H2PO4^- rather than lose a proton to become PO4^3-.

So the concentration of PO4^3- would be very low because the pH is much lower than pKa3.

But maybe we can calculate it using the third dissociation step.

The third dissociation is HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- ; Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

At pH 7.09, the concentration of H+ is 10^(-7.09) ≈ 8.23e-8 M.

The expression for Ka3 is:

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]

We can rearrange to solve for [PO4^3-]:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] ) / [H+]

Plugging in the numbers:

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] is 0.02805 M.

[H+] ≈ 8.23e-8 M.

So:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / 8.23e-8

Calculate numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02805 ≈ 5.049e-14.

Then divide by 8.23e-8: 5.049e-14 / 8.23e-8 ≈ 6.13e-7 M.

Wait, but wait. Is that the correct approach? Because when dealing with multiple dissociation steps, you have to consider all possible equilibria. But in this case, the solution is mainly a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and any PO4^3- would be formed from the third dissociation of HPO4^2-.

But another thought: the initial concentrations of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- determine the pH, which in turn affects the extent of the third dissociation. So the calculation above should be correct.

Wait, but let me double-check the math.

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02805 M.

[H+] = 1e-7.09 ≈ 8.23e-8 M.

So,

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / (8.23e-8 )

Calculate numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02805 ≈ 5.049e-14.

Denominator: 8.23e-8.

So 5.049e-14 / 8.23e-8 = (5.049 /8.23) * 1e-6 ≈ 0.613 * 1e-6 = 6.13e-7 M.

So that's approximately 6.13e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close. Option D is 3.97e-7, option B is 5.48e-7, option C is 2.81e-7.

Wait, but wait a second. My calculation gives about 6.13e-7, which is closest to option A (6.24e-7). But why is the given answer not one of the options exactly?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's recompute more accurately.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02805.

1.8 * 0.02805 = 0.05049. So 0.05049e-12 = 5.049e-14.

Denominator: [H+] is 10^(-7.09) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.09) ≈ 1e-7 * 0.8123 ≈ 8.123e-8 → let me use more accurate value.

Wait, 7.09 is the pH. So pOH is 14-7.09=6.91, but that's for OH-.

Wait, but H+ is 10^-7.09.

Let me compute 10^(-7.09) accurately.

10^(-7) is 1e-7.

10^(-0.09) is approximately 0.8123. So 1e-7 * 0.8123 ≈ 8.123e-8.

So [H+] = 8.123e-8.

So [PO4^3-] = (5.049e-14) / (8.123e-8) = (5.049 /8.123) * 1e-6.

5.049/8.123 ≈ 0.6214.

So 0.6214e-6 → 6.214e-7 M.

That's about 6.21e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. So why the slight difference? Maybe due to more precise calculation of log(0.02805/0.036695) or more precise pH.

Wait, let's re-calculate the pH more accurately.

The ratio [base]/[acid] is [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.02805 / 0.036695 ≈ 0.7645.

Log(0.7645) = log(7.645e-1) = log(7.645) + log(1e-1) → log(7.645) is about 0.884 (since 10^0.88=7.69), so log(0.7645)= -0.115.

Wait, more accurately, log(0.7645) = ?

Using exact calculation: log(0.7645) ≈ -0.115.

So pH = 7.207 -0.115 = 7.092.

But perhaps using more precise values for the ratio.

Actually, 0.02805 /0.036695 = (0.02805 *1e4)/(0.036695 *1e4) = 280.5 / 366.95 ≈ 0.7645.

So same as before.

So pH is 7.092, which gives [H+] = 10^(-7.092) ≈ 8.13e-8.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 *0.02805) / 8.13e-8.

Let me compute 0.02805 *1.8e-12 = 5.049e-14.

Then 5.049e-14 /8.13e-8 = (5.049/8.13) *1e-6.

5.049 divided by 8.13 is approximately 0.621.

So 0.621e-6 = 6.21e-7 M.

Which is approximately 6.21e-7 M. The closest option is A)6.24e-7. Hmm. But wait, perhaps a more precise calculation is needed.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the exact [H+] from the Hendersen equation.

pH = 7.092 → [H+] = 10^(-7.092) = 8.12e-8.

So 5.049e-14 /8.12e-8 = (5.049 /8.12) * 1e-6.

5.049 /8.12 → let me calculate that more precisely.

8.12 × 0.62 → 5.0284 → which is very close to 5.049.

So 5.049 /8.12 = 0.62175 approximately.

So 0.62175e-6 → 6.2175e-7 M.

Which rounds to 6.22e-7 M. So the answer is approximately 6.22e-7, which would be closest to option A (6.24e-7). But wait, another possibility: perhaps the solution is considering the contribution of both HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- in the third dissociation. Or maybe I made a mistake in considering all the steps.

Wait, another thought: when we have HPO4^2-, it can lose a proton to become PO4^3- as per Ka3. But also, H2PO4^- can lose two protons to become PO4^3- (but that's a two-step process, requiring H3PO4 → H2PO4^- → HPO4^2- → PO4^3-). The overall reaction would be H3PO4 → PO4^3- + 3 H+.

But in the solution, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so perhaps the total phosphate species include all forms. But given that the solution's pH is lower than pKa3, the concentration of PO4^3- is minimal, and the major species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But perhaps I should also consider that the presence of H2PO4^- could affect the third dissociation. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the concentration of H+ is better calculated considering the exact pH from the buffer.

Wait, maybe I should compute the exact [H+] using the buffer equation.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa2 + log([A-]/[HA]), where [A-] is HPO4^2- and [HA] is H2PO4^-.

So, [A-] = 0.02805 M, [HA] = 0.036695 M.

So, the ratio is 0.7645, and as before, log(0.7645) ≈ -0.115.

So, pH = 7.207 - 0.115 = 7.092.

Then, [H+] = 10^-7.092 ≈ 8.12e-8 M.

So, the earlier calculation is correct.

Thus, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / 8.12e-8 ≈ 6.22e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close to 6.22e-7. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but wait another thing. The problem statement says that the solution contains 1.00 g of each salt. But when you add the two salts, do they contribute to the total concentration of phosphate species? For example, the moles of phosphate from each salt.

Wait, each mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^-.

Each mole of Na2HPO4·2H2O gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

So the total moles of phosphate are 0.007339 (H2PO4^-) + 0.005610 (HPO4^2-) = 0.012949 mol.

But the total volume is 0.2 L, so the total phosphate concentration is 0.012949 /0.2 = 0.064745 M. But I don't think that's directly needed, since the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but perhaps the presence of PO4^3- comes from the deprotonation of HPO4^2-, and any contribution from H2PO4^- would require two deprotonations, but under pH 7.09, that's highly unlikely because the solution is not basic enough.

So, the only source of PO4^3- is the third dissociation of HPO4^2-.

So I think the initial approach is correct.

Therefore, the concentration of PO4^3- is approximately 6.22e-7 M, which is close to option A's 6.24e-7.

But wait, in the options, option D is 3.97e-7, which is about half of what I calculated. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I should express the [PO4^3-] as (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02805 M.

[H+] = 8.12e-8.

So,

(1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / (8.12e-8) = (5.049e-14) / (8.12e-8) = (5.049 /8.12) * 1e-6 → 0.62175e-6 → 6.2175e-7 M.

Which is approximately 6.22e-7 M. So that's about 6.22e-7, which is very close to option A (6.24e-7), so that must be the correct answer.

But looking again, another thought: perhaps the problem is that when you mix KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, the solution may form a buffer with pH around pKa2, but perhaps the [PO4^3-] comes from another source. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the concentration of all phosphate species, but that doesn't make sense because the options are all very low.

Wait, but the question is about orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3-, not the other species like H2PO4^- or HPO4^2-.

So I think the calculation is correct, and the answer should be option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of phosphate species in the given buffer system. The solution contains 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ (molar mass = 136.09 g/mol) and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O (molar mass = 177.99 g/mol) in 200.00 cm³ (0.2 L). The dissociation steps of H₃PO₄ are:

1. **H₃PO₄ ↔ H⁺ + H₂PO₄⁻** (Ka₁ = 7.5 × 10⁻³)  
2. **H₂PO₄⁻ ↔ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻** (Ka₂ = 6.2 × 10⁻⁸)  
3. **HPO₄²⁻ ↔ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻** (Ka₃ = 1.8 × 10⁻¹²)  

### Step 1: Calculate moles of phosphate species
- Moles of KH₂PO₄ = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.007339 \, \text{mol} \), contributing [H₂PO₄⁻] = \( \frac{0.007339}{0.2} \approx 0.036695 \, \text{M} \).
- Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005610 \, \text{mol} \), contributing [HPO₄²⁻] = \( \frac{0.005610}{0.2} \approx 0.02805 \, \text{M} \).

### Step 2: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to estimate pH
The solution is a buffer with [H₂PO₄⁻] and [HPO₄²⁻], corresponding to the second dissociation of H₃PO₄. Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa}_2 + \log \left( \frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]} \right)
\]

- \( \text{pKa}_2 = \log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.207 \),
- \( \frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]} = \frac{0.02805}{0.036695} \approx 0.7645 \),
- \( \log(0.7645) \approx -0.115 \).

Thus,  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.207 - 0.115 \approx 7.092.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate [PO₄³⁻] using Ka₃
The third dissociation of HPO₄²⁻ is:

\[
\text{HPO₄²⁻} \leftrightarrow \text{H⁺} + \text{PO₄³⁻}, \quad K_a = 1.8 \times 10^{-12}.
\]

Using the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_a = \frac{[\text{H⁺}][\text{PO₄³⁻}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]} \implies [\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{K_a \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H⁺}]}.
\]

- \( [\text{H⁺}] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.092} \approx 8.12 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M} \),
- \( [\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02805)}{8.12 \times 10^{-8}} \).

First, calculate the numerator:  
\[
(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02805) \approx 5.049 \times 10^{-14}.
\]

Then divide by \( [\text{H⁺}] \):  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{5.049 \times 10^{-14}}{8.12 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.21 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

### Step 4: Compare with options
The calculated concentration of PO₄³⁻ is approximately \( 6.21 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which is closest to option A (\( 6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \)).

**Answer: A**
