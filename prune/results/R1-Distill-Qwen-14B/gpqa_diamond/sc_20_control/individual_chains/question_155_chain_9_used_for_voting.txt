Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Alright, the question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator. Hmm, right, uncertainty is calculated using the standard deviation, so I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared, then take the square root of the variance.

Wait, the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). So, that's the state vector ψ.

First, I remember that the expectation value of an operator is given by ⟨ψ|Ô|ψ⟩. So for P_z, I'll need to compute ⟨P_z⟩ = ψ† P_z ψ.

Looking at the matrix form of P_z:
- The first row is [ħ, 0, 0]
- Second row is [0, 0, 0]
- Third row is [0,0,-ħ]

So, P_z is a diagonal matrix with elements ħ, 0, -ħ on the diagonal.

The state vector ψ is a column vector with components (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me write that as a column:
ψ = [ -1/2
       1/√2
       -1/2 ]

Wait, but wait, the basis is the eigenvectors of P_z. So the basis states |+z⟩, |0z⟩, |-z⟩ correspond to the columns of the P_z matrix. So the state ψ is expressed in this basis.

So, to compute ⟨P_z⟩, I can take ψ† multiplied by P_z multiplied by ψ.

Let me calculate that. ψ† is the conjugate transpose, but since all the components are real here, it's just the transpose. So, ψ† is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]

Multiply ψ† by P_z: each component of ψ is multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element.

Wait, more accurately, when you multiply ψ† (which is a row vector) by P_z (a diagonal matrix), you get a row vector where each element is ψ_i * P_z_ii.

So,

ψ† P_z = [ (-1/2)*ħ, (1/√2)*0, (-1/2)*(-ħ) ) ]

Which simplifies to [ (-ħ/2), 0, (ħ/2) ]

Then, multiply this row vector by ψ. So each element is multiplied by the corresponding component of ψ.

So,

⟨P_z⟩ = (-ħ/2)*(-1/2) + 0*(1/√2) + (ħ/2)*(-1/2)

Hmm, let's compute each term:

First term: (-ħ/2) * (-1/2) = ħ/4
Second term: 0 * anything is 0
Third term: (ħ/2) * (-1/2) = -ħ/4

Adding them up: ħ/4 + 0 - ħ/4 = 0. Oh, so ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Wait, that's interesting. So the expectation value of P_z is zero. Then, for the uncertainty, I need ⟨(P_z - ⟨P_z⟩)^2⟩, which is ⟨P_z²⟩ because ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

So now I need to compute ⟨P_z²⟩, which is ψ† P_z² ψ.

But P_z squared is just each diagonal element squared. So the P_z² matrix has elements (ħ)^2, 0, ( -ħ )^2 on the diagonal, which is ħ², 0, ħ².

So,

ψ† P_z² is [ (-1/2)^2 * ħ², (1/√2)^2 * 0, (-1/2)^2 * ħ² ].

Wait, no. Wait, ψ† is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]

Multiply by P_z², which is:

[ (ħ², 0, 0)
  (0, 0, 0)
  (0, 0, ħ²) ]

So, ψ† P_z² is [ (-1/2)*ħ², (1/√2)*0, (-1/2)*ħ² ]

So that row is [ (-ħ²/2 ), 0, (-ħ²/2 ) ]

Wait, no, ψ† P_z² would be:

( (-1/2) * ħ² ) + (1/√2) * 0 + (-1/2) * ħ² ? No, wait, no, matrix multiplication is different.

Wait, no, when you multiply a row vector (ψ†) by a matrix (P_z²), it's equivalent to each element of ψ† multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element of P_z², because P_z is diagonal.

So,

ψ† P_z² = [ (-1/2) * ħ², (1/√2) * 0, (-1/2) * ħ² ]

Which is [ (-ħ²/2 ), 0, (-ħ²/2 ) ]

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because when you multiply a row vector [a, b, c] by a diagonal matrix with elements d1, d2, d3, it's [a*d1, b*d2, c*d3]. So yes, that's correct.

So the row is [ (-ħ²/2 ), 0, (-ħ²/2 ) ]

Now, multiply this by ψ, which is the column vector [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

So,

⟨P_z²⟩ = (-ħ²/2) * (-1/2) + 0 * (1/√2) + (-ħ²/2) * (-1/2 )

Calculating each term:
First term: (ħ²/2) * (1/2) = ħ²/4
Second term: 0
Third term: (ħ²/2) * (1/2) = ħ²/4

Adding them: ħ²/4 + 0 + ħ²/4 = ħ²/2.

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is ħ²/2.

So the variance is ⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩². Since ⟨P_z⟩ is zero, variance is ħ²/2.

So the uncertainty ΔP_z is the square root of the variance, which is sqrt(ħ²/2) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2), so that's the answer.

To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The matrix form of $P_z$ is diagonal with elements $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$ on the diagonal:

\[
P_z = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is computed as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z \psi.
\]

First, compute $\psi^\dagger P_z$:

\[
\psi^\dagger P_z = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{bmatrix}
= \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Now, multiply this by $\psi$:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Compute each term:

- First term: $-\frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot -\frac{1}{2} = \frac{\hbar}{4}$,
- Second term: $0 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = 0$,
- Third term: $\frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot -\frac{1}{2} = -\frac{\hbar}{4}$.

Adding these:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{4} + 0 - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The matrix $P_z^2$ is the square of $P_z$, which is also diagonal with elements $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$:

\[
P_z^2 = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is computed as:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z^2 \psi.
\]

First, compute $\psi^\dagger P_z^2$:

\[
\psi^\dagger P_z^2 = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{bmatrix}
= \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{\hbar^2}{2} & 0 & -\frac{\hbar^2}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Now, multiply this by $\psi$:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{\hbar^2}{2} & 0 & -\frac{\hbar^2}{2} \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Compute each term:

- First term: $-\frac{\hbar^2}{2} \cdot -\frac{1}{2} = \frac{\hbar^2}{4}$,
- Second term: $0 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = 0$,
- Third term: $-\frac{\hbar^2}{2} \cdot -\frac{1}{2} = \frac{\hbar^2}{4}$.

Adding these:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the Uncertainty
The variance is:

\[
\text{Variance} = \langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0 = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

The uncertainty is the square root of the variance:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to **Option B**.
