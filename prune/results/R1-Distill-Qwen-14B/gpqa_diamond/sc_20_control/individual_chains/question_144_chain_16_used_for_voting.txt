Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it. The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data includes its production energy, mass, and width. 

Right, I remember that the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its decay width. Oh wait, the formula I think is tau equals h-bar divided by the width Gamma. But wait, wait. The decay width Gamma is the total decay rate, right? So the lifetime is inversely proportional to Gamma.

But wait, isn't the decay width related to the uncertainty principle here? Yeah, I think the uncertainty principle comes into play for the lifetime and energy uncertainty. So Gamma is like the energy uncertainty, and the lifetime is the uncertainty in time multiplied by h-bar. So yeah, Gamma is the total width, and tau = ħ / Gamma.

But wait, I also remember that the mean decay length depends on the velocity of the particle and its lifetime. So the decay distance L is v multiplied by tau. So L = v * tau.

Wait, but how do I find v? I think I can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation. Since the production energy E is given, which is 8 GeV. The mass of X is 1.2 GeV. So E is much larger than the mass? Because 8 is more than 1.2, so it's a high-energy particle.

In that case, the energy E is approximately equal to the total energy, which is gamma m c squared. So gamma would be E/(m c²). Wait, but E is given in GeV, same as m. Oh, but we have to make sure about units. Let me see: since both E and m are in GeV, and c is in m/s. Wait, perhaps the units will work out when we use proper constants.

Wait, let me think about the steps:

1. Calculate the lifetime tau using tau = ħ / Gamma.
2. Find the velocity v of the meson.
3. Multiply v by tau to get the mean decay distance L.

So let's break it down. 

First, tau = ħ / Gamma. But Gamma is given in MeV. Wait, 320 MeV. So I need to convert that into units compatible with ħ. Because ħ is usually in J·s, and GeV is energy. So I need to convert Gamma from MeV to J.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to work in natural units where ħ c is taken into account. Alternatively, I can use the appropriate constants to convert everything.

Wait, the formula for decay length is L = v * gamma * ħ c / (m X c²) * (1/ Gamma) )? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait no. Let me think in terms of units. So Gamma is in MeV. Let's convert Gamma to GeV. Since 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV.

Then tau is hbar divided by Gamma. So hbar is 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So tau = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 s. Let me compute that: 6.582e-25 / 0.32 is approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, but wait, let me check the calculation again. 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32. 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 is 2.056875e-24 seconds. So tau is approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Next, find the velocity v. Since the meson is moving with energy E =8 GeV, mass m =1.2 GeV/c². Hmm, using E² = (pc c)² + (m c²)². So E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2 ). But since E is 8 GeV and mc² is 1.2 GeV, and 8 is much larger than 1.2, we can approximate E ≈ pc. So p ≈ E / c.

Wait, but wait, that's only a good approximation when E >> mc². Because if E is about 6 times larger than mc², which is 1.2 GeV, then 8 is about 6.66 times 1.2, which is significant but not super high. So maybe the approximation E ≈ pc is okay, but perhaps a more precise calculation would be better.

Alternatively, let's compute beta = v/c. Since E = gamma m c², and p = gamma m v. So v = (p c²)/(E). Hmm. Let me think.

Alternatively, I can compute the beta factor using beta = (pc²)/(E), but perhaps a more straightforward approach is to compute beta as (E² - (m c²)^2 )^(1/2) / E. Because E² = (pc)^2 c² + (m c²)^2. So (pc)^2 c² = E² - (m c²)^2. So pc = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2) / c. Then p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2 ) / (c^2). Hmm, perhaps it's getting a bit messy.

Wait, another way: The velocity beta is v/c = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²)) ). So beta = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²)).

Wait, let's plug the numbers in. E is 8 GeV, m c² is 1.2 GeV. So E² is (8)^2 =64 (GeV)^2, (m c²)^2 is (1.2)^2=1.44 (GeV)^2. So 1 - (1.44)/(64) = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So beta = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So v is approximately 0.9887 c.

Wait, that's a high velocity, which makes sense since E is much larger than the rest mass.

So v = 0.9887 c. c is about 3e8 m/s.

Now, the mean decay distance L is v * tau. So L = v * tau.

Wait, but wait, I need to make sure about the units. Let me compute that.

Tau is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

v is approximately 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s. Let's compute that: 0.9887 * 3e8 ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

So L = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = ?

Calculating the product:

Multiply 2.966 and 2.056875 first. 2.966 * 2 is about 5.932, 2.966 * 0.056875 is approximately 0.168. So total is around 6.100.

So 6.100e8 * 1e-24 = 6.1e-16 meters. Wait, that's 6.1e-16 m. Hmm.

Wait, but looking at the options, the options are:

A) 5.0223e-16 m

B) 4.0655e-15 m

C)5.0223e-15 m

D)4.0655e-16 m

Hmm, my calculation gives around 6.1e-16. None of the options is exactly that. So perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me go through each step again.

Let me re-calculate tau. Gamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

Tau = hbar / Gamma. hbar in GeV·s is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = let me compute that: 6.582 / 0.32 is 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s. That's correct.

Now, the velocity calculation: beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)).

Wait, E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c². So m c² is 1.2 GeV. So (m c²)^2 is (1.2)^2 = 1.44 (GeV)^2, E² is 64 (GeV)^2. 1.44/64 = 0.0225. So 1-0.0225 = 0.9775. sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887. So beta is about 0.9887, so v is 0.9887c.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta. Let me compute it more accurately. 0.9775 to the square root.

Let me compute sqrt(0.9775). Let's see, 0.98^2 is 0.9604. 0.99^2 is 0.9801. 0.988^2 is (0.98 + 0.008)^2 ≈ 0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.008 + 0.008^2 = 0.9604 + 0.01568 + 0.000064 = 0.976144. Close to 0.9775.

Wait, 0.988^2 = approximately 0.9761, which is less than 0.9775. So what's 0.989^2?

0.989 * 0.989. Let's compute 989^2 = (990-1)^2 = 990^2 - 2*990 +1 = 980100 - 1980 +1 = 980100-1979=978121. So 0.989^2 = 0.978121.

Wait, 0.9775 is between 0.9761 (0.988^2) and 0.978121 (0.989^2). So let's see: 0.9775 is 0.9775 - 0.9761 = 0.0014 above 0.988^2.

The difference between 0.989^2 and 0.988^2 is 0.978121 - 0.976144 = 0.001977.

So 0.9775 is 0.9775 - 0.976144 = 0.001356 above 0.988^2. So the fraction is 0.001356 / 0.001977 ≈ 0.686. So sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.988 + 0.686*(0.001) ≈ 0.988686. So approximately 0.9887, as I thought earlier.

So v is about 0.9887 times the speed of light.

So L = v * tau = 0.9887 * c * tau.

c = 3e8 m/s.

So 0.9887 *3e8 m/s = approx 2.966e8 m/s.

Tau is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Multiply 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 2.966 * 2.056875 = let's calculate that accurately.

2.966 * 2 = 5.932.

2.966 * 0.056875 = let's compute:

0.05 * 2.966 = 0.1483.

0.006875 * 2.966 = 0.02036.

So total 0.1483 + 0.02036 = 0.16866.

So 5.932 + 0.16866 = 6.10066.

So 6.10066e8 * 1e-24 = 6.10066e-16 meters.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the velocity. Let me double-check the velocity.

Another approach: E² = (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2.

So, p = sqrt( (E^2 - (mc^2)^2) ) / c².

Wait, but perhaps using beta as (E² - m² c^4) / (E c) )

Wait, let me think in terms of beta and gamma.

Gamma is E/(mc²). So gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... ≈ 6.6667.

Beta is sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma^2)).

So beta = sqrt(1 - (1/(6.6667^2))).

6.6667^2 is 44.4444.

1/44.4444 is ~0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So sqrt(0.9775) is approx 0.9887, as before.

So v is indeed about 0.9887c.

Wait, but perhaps the calculation of L is missing a factor, like maybe I should be using the mean lifetime multiplied by the velocity and the c factor correctly? Let me think about units.

Wait, tau is in seconds, v is in m/s, so multiplying them gives meters. So L = v * tau.

Wait, another thing: perhaps I should use the proper decay length formula, which is L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

Wait, gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 6.6667 in this case.

So perhaps I should compute L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

Wait, wait, tau is the proper lifetime, but when moving at velocity v, the mean lifetime as observed is gamma * tau. So the mean path length is v multiplied by gamma tau.

Wait, no. Let me clarify:

The mean lifetime in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime (tau_0). So tau_lab = gamma * tau_0.

So the mean distance L is v * tau_lab = v * gamma * tau_0.

But in my earlier calculation, I used tau_0 = hbar / Gamma, which is correct.

Wait, but in the calculation of L, I think I used tau_0, the proper lifetime. Because when I calculated tau, it was hbar/Gamma, which is the proper lifetime. Then, L is v multiplied by gamma * tau_0, because the lifetime observed is longer by gamma.

Wait, did I forget the gamma factor in the earlier calculation? That might be where I went wrong.

Ah, I think I made a mistake there. Let me recalculate.

So, tau_0 is the proper lifetime: tau_0 = hbar / Gamma.

In the lab frame, the lifetime is tau_lab = gamma * tau_0.

Then, the mean decay length is L = v * tau_lab = v * gamma * tau_0.

Previously, I calculated v * tau_0, but I should have included gamma.

So, let me recalculate.

Gamma (Lorentz factor) is 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667.

Tau_0 is 2.056875e-24 s.

So gamma * tau_0 = 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 s ≈ 1.37125e-23 s.

Then, v is 0.9887c ≈ 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

So L = v * gamma tau_0 = 2.966e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s = let's compute that.

2.966e8 * 1.37125e-23 = 2.966 * 1.37125 = about 4.0655 (since 3*1.37 is 4.11, but more accurately: 2.966 *1.37125.

Let me compute 2.966 *1.37125:

Break it down:

2.966 *1 = 2.966.

2.966 *0.3 = 0.8898.

2.966 *0.07 = 0.20762.

2.966 *0.00125=0.0037075.

Adding them:

2.966 + 0.8898 = 3.8558.

3.8558 + 0.20762 = 4.0634.

4.0634 + 0.0037075 ≈4.0671.

So approximately 4.067e-15 meters.

Wait, no, because 2.966e8 m/s multiplied by 1.37125e-23 s gives 4.067e-15 meters.

Wait, 2.966e8 * 1.37125e-23 = (2.966 * 1.37125) * 1e8 * 1e-23 = (4.067) * 1e-15 = 4.067e-15 m.

Looking back at the options:

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

Option D is 4.0655e-16 m.

Hmm, so 4.067e-15 m is very close to option B, which is 4.0655e-15 m.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but why is the earlier calculation without the gamma factor giving a higher value? Because I forgot to account for the time dilation. So including the gamma factor reduces the distance by a factor of 1/gamma, but wait no, the gamma factor is in the lifetime, which would actually make the decay length longer. Oh wait, no: without the gamma factor, I was using the proper lifetime, which is shorter. So the correct calculation should include gamma, making the path longer.

Wait, in the initial calculation without gamma, I got about 6e-16 m, which isn't any of the options. But when I include gamma, I get around 4.06e-15 m.

So the correct answer must be option B or C.

Wait, the options are:

A) 5.0223e-16

B)4.0655e-15

C)5.0223e-15

D)4.0655e-16

So with the correct calculation, option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

So the correct answer is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the following steps:

1. **Calculate the proper lifetime (\( \tau_0 \)):**  
   The proper lifetime is given by \( \tau_0 = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \), where \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \) and \( \Gamma = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \) (since \( 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \)).  
   \[
   \tau_0 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
   \]

2. **Calculate the Lorentz factor (\( \gamma \)):**  
   The Lorentz factor is given by \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} \), where \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m c^2 = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \).  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667.
   \]

3. **Calculate the velocity (\( v \)):**  
   The velocity is determined using the relativistic relation \( \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{(m c^2)^2}{E^2}} \), where \( \beta = \frac{v}{c} \).  
   \[
   \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{(1.2)^2}{(8)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1.44}{64}} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
   \]  
   Thus, \( v = \beta c = 0.9887 \times 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \approx 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \).

4. **Calculate the mean decay distance (\( L \)):**  
   The mean decay distance is given by \( L = v \cdot \gamma \cdot \tau_0 \). Substituting the values:  
   \[
   L = (2.966 \times 10^8) \cdot (6.6667) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}).
   \]  
   First, calculate \( \gamma \cdot \tau_0 \):  
   \[
   \gamma \cdot \tau_0 = 6.6667 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} = 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}.
   \]  
   Then, calculate \( L \):  
   \[
   L = (2.966 \times 10^8) \cdot (1.37125 \times 10^{-23}) = 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
   \]

5. **Compare with the options:**  
   The calculated value \( L \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) matches closely with option **B** (\( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)).

**Answer: B**
