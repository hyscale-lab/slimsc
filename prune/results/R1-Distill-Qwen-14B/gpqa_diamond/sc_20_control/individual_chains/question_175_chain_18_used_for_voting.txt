Okay, so I have this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Alright, the question says we have an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroid-shaped, with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a certain wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power radiated per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and the angle θ from the z-axis. The maximum power is A. We need to find two things: the fraction of A radiated at θ=30 degrees, and the possible form of f in terms of λ.

The options are A, B, C, D, each giving a fraction and a λ dependence.

I remember that when charges oscillate, they emit electromagnetic radiation. The radiation pattern depends on the symmetry of the charge distribution. Since it's spheroid-shaped with symmetry along z, the radiation should be dipolar, right? Or maybe quadrupolar? Wait, no, spheroid could be a dipole-like distribution. But for a dipole, the radiation pattern has certain characteristics.

Wait, dipole radiation. The power radiated by a dipole varies with the angle. I think the radiation pattern for a dipole is such that the intensity is maximum in the plane perpendicular to the axis (θ=90 degrees) and falls off as you go towards the poles (θ=0 and 180 degrees). The formula for the power per unit solid angle (like the radiation intensity) for a dipole is proportional to (1 + cos²θ), but wait, no, that's the radiation pattern for the electric field. Or wait, maybe the intensity is proportional to (1 + cos²θ).

Wait, let me think. The electric field of a dipole varies as (1 + cos²θ) when you're in the far field, which is the radiation zone. But how does the power depend on that? Power is proportional to the square of the electric field. So if E is proportional to (1 + cos²θ), then the intensity (power per unit area) would be proportional to (1 + cos²θ)^2. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing up things. Alternatively, maybe the intensity is proportional to sin²θ multiplied by something else.

Wait, another approach. The radiation from a dipole has a certain angular dependence. The maximum radiation is perpendicular to the axis (θ=90 degrees), and it's zero along the axis (θ=0 and 180). Wait, no, I think that's for an ideal dipole. No, wait, the radiation from a dipole in the far field has a pattern where the intensity is highest perpendicular to the dipole axis and falls off as you go towards the poles. But I'm not exactly sure about the functional form.

Wait, let me remember the formula. The radiation intensity (power per unit solid angle) for a dipole is given by something like (p² ω⁴)/(something with c and constants), multiplied by (1 + cos²θ). Or wait, no, the formula for the power per unit solid angle (intensity) is proportional to (1 + cos²θ) multiplied by some function of wavelength or frequency, but the angular part is (1 + cos²θ). Wait, no, that can't be right because when θ is 0, cosθ is 1, so (1 + 1) = 2, but wait, no, the dipole radiation maximum is at θ=90 degrees, where cosθ is zero, so (1 + 0) = 1, but that doesn't make sense because at θ=90, intensity should be max. Hmm, wait, maybe I have it wrong.

Wait, perhaps the correct angular dependence is sin²θ. Because in the case of a dipole, the radiation is maximum in the equatorial plane (θ=90), which would correspond to sinθ being 1. So maybe the intensity is proportional to sin²θ.

Wait no, the dipole's electric field in the far zone is E ~ (p sinθ e^{i(kr - ωt)}) / r. The intensity is proportional to the square of E, so (sinθ)^2. But wait, that's the E-field. The Poynting vector for dipole radiation is proportional to (sinθ)^2, so the power per unit solid angle (intensity) is proportional to sin²θ.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The dipole's radiation pattern: the maximum occurs at θ=90°, and it's zero along the axis (θ=0 and 180). So the intensity must be proportional to sin²θ. Because when θ=90, sinθ=1, so maximum. When θ=0, sinθ=0, so intensity is zero. That makes sense. So the function f(θ) should be proportional to sin²θ.

So the maximum intensity occurs at θ=90°, and the intensity at θ=30° would be sin²(30°) = (0.5)^2 = 0.25. So the fraction of maximum power at θ=30° is 0.25, which is 1/4.

Wait, but the maximum power A is the maximum of f(θ), which occurs at θ=90°, where sin²θ is 1. So the fraction at θ=30° is 25% of A, which is 1/4. So the fraction is 1/4.

Now, what about the functional form of f in terms of λ? The function f(θ) is the power per unit solid angle, which is the intensity. For a dipole radiator, the intensity is proportional to (ω^4) * (p^2) / (c^6) * sin²θ. But ω is related to the frequency, which is related to λ.

Wait, the relation between wavelength λ and frequency ω is c = ω λ. So ω = c/λ. So ω^4 is (c^4)/(λ^4). So substituting, the intensity would be proportional to (1/λ^4) * sin²θ.

So f(θ) ~ (1/λ^4) sin²θ. Therefore, the function f depends on λ as λ^(-4).

Putting this together, the fraction of maximum power at θ=30° is 1/4, and the function f depends on λ as λ^(-4). Looking at the options:

Option C says 1/4 and λ^(-4). So the first part is 1/4 and the second part is λ^(-4). So the answer should be option C.

To analyze the problem, we consider the radiation pattern of an oscillating charge distribution that is spheroid in shape, with symmetry along the z-axis. The radiation pattern depends on the angle \( \theta \) relative to the z-axis, and the power radiated per unit solid angle is given as a function \( f(\lambda, \theta) \). The goal is to determine the fraction of the maximum power \( A \) radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) and the functional dependence of \( f \) on \( \lambda \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Radiation Pattern**: For a dipole-like oscillating charge distribution, the radiation intensity (power per unit solid angle) is proportional to \( \sin^2\theta \). This means the intensity is maximum at \( \theta = 90^\circ \) (in the equatorial plane) and decreases as \( \theta \) approaches \( 0^\circ \) or \( 180^\circ \).

2. **Fraction of Maximum Power at \( \theta = 30^\circ \)**:
   - The intensity at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is proportional to \( \sin^2(30^\circ) = (0.5)^2 = 0.25 \).
   - Since the maximum intensity occurs at \( \theta = 90^\circ \), where \( \sin^2(90^\circ) = 1 \), the fraction of the maximum power radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \( 0.25 \), or \( \frac{1}{4} \).

3. **Functional Dependence of \( f \) on \( \lambda \)**:
   - The radiation intensity is proportional to \( \omega^4 \), where \( \omega \) is the angular frequency. Using the relation \( \omega = \frac{c}{\lambda} \), we find \( \omega^4 \propto \frac{1}{\lambda^4} \).
   - Therefore, the function \( f \) depends on \( \lambda \) as \( \lambda^{-4} \).

### Conclusion:
The fraction of the maximum power radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \( \frac{1}{4} \), and the functional dependence of \( f \) on \( \lambda \) is \( \lambda^{-4} \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
