Okay, so I've got this question about electron microscopes and mean free paths. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on the concepts here, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the setup is Mike has this high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at 1000 kV. He uses vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment, like less than 10^-9 Torr. That's super low pressure, right? The idea is to minimize gas molecules because if there are fewer gas particles, the electrons won't scatter as much, leading to better image resolution.

But even with that ultra-high vacuum, some gas particles remain. The mass spec detects them, so Mike measures the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. Mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, I remember. It depends on things like pressure, temperature, and the size of the molecules.

So, when he starts the electron beam, he notices something interesting. The mean free path changes to λ2, and it's not the same as λ1. But the temperature in the sample compartment is the same, so no change there. So what's causing the mean free path to change?

Wait, the mean free path in gases is given by λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), or something like that. Or wait, another formula I recall is λ = (1/√(n * π * d²)), where n is the number density. Or maybe it's λ = (1)/(n * π * d²/2)^(1/2), I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, the mean free path can also be expressed using the ideal gas law. Since P = n R T, where R is the gas constant, then n = P/(R T). So substituting that into the mean free path equation, λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2) * π * d² * (P/(R T))) )? Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the formulas.

Let me think again. The mean free path λ is inversely proportional to the pressure and proportional to the temperature. Because higher pressure means more molecules, so shorter mean free path. Higher temperature, faster moving molecules, so longer mean free path. So if P decreases, λ increases, and if T increases, λ increases.

In this scenario, initially, when the vacuum is achieved, the mean free path is λ1, which is probably quite large because the pressure is so low. But when Mike starts the electron beam, the pressure doesn't change because the pumps are still running and the temperature is the same. So why would λ change?

Wait, maybe when the electron beam is on, it heats the gas molecules? But the problem states that the temperature remains the same. So temperature isn't the factor here. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam causes some effect on the gas. Oh, wait! When the electron beam is on, the electrons are moving through the gas. Are the electrons interacting with the gas molecules in a way that changes the effective conditions for the gas's mean free path?

Wait, another thought. The presence of a strong electric field, like the electron beam, could affect the gas. High-energy electrons might cause gas ionization. If the gas is ionized, the mean free path could change because charged particles interact differently. But wait, the mean free path is for the gas molecules themselves. If the electrons are causing ionization, then the gas becomes partially ionized. Now, ions have a different cross-section for collisions—maybe higher because they have a charge, so they're more likely to collide.

If the gas becomes ionized, the effective pressure might increase because the mean free path depends on the number density and the collision cross-section. Wait, no. If the gas is ionized, the number of collisions could increase, but how does that affect the mean free path? Because the mean free path is inversely proportional to the product of the number density and the collision cross-section. So if the cross-section increases (as ions have larger effective sizes due to charge), the mean free path would decrease. So λ2 would be less than λ1.

Wait, but the mean free path λ is for the gas molecules. So if the gas is ionized, the gas molecules (which are now ions) would have a higher cross-section. So λ would decrease. So earlier, in the vacuum state, the gas isn't ionized, so λ1 is higher. When the beam is on, ionization happens, so the cross-section d increases, leading to a smaller λ2. So λ2 < λ1. So the correct answer would be option C.

Alternatively, maybe the electron beam somehow causes the gas to heat, but the problem says the temperature remains the same. So no change in T. So, ionization is the key factor here. So the mean free path would decrease, so λ2 is less than λ1.

So looking at the options:

A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 → No, because λ would be smaller.

B) λ2=λ1 → Mike's observation says it's different, so this can't be right.

C) λ2 < λ1 → Yes, this would be the case if the cross-section increases.

D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22 → No, because λ2 is smaller than λ1.

So the conclusion is option C.

The question involves understanding the mean free path (λ) of gas molecules in a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating under ultra-high vacuum conditions. Initially, Mike measures the mean free path as λ1 under the vacuum state, where the pressure is less than 10^-9 Torr. However, upon initiating the electron beam, the mean free path changes to λ2, despite the temperature remaining constant.

The mean free path λ is influenced by factors such as pressure, temperature, and the collision cross-section of the gas molecules. Since the temperature is constant, any change in λ must be due to changes in the effective pressure or the collision cross-section. When the electron beam is turned on, the high-energy electrons can ionize the gas molecules. Ionization increases the effective collision cross-section of the gas molecules because charged particles interact more strongly with each other. This increase in the collision cross-section reduces the mean free path, leading to λ2 being smaller than λ1.

Analyzing the options:

- **A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1**: This is incorrect because the mean free path decreases due to increased collisions caused by ionization.
- **B) λ2 = λ1**: This is incorrect because Mike's observation explicitly states that λ changes when the electron beam is initiated.
- **C) λ2 < λ1**: This is correct because ionization increases the collision cross-section, reducing the mean free path.
- **D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1**: This is incorrect because λ2 is smaller than λ1, not larger.

Thus, the correct conclusion is that λ2 < λ1 due to the increased collision cross-section caused by ionization when the electron beam is on.
