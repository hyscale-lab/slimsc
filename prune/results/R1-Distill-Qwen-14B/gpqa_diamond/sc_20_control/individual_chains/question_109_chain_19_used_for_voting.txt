Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll take it slowly.

So, the question is about a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X. The particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. The problem gives a condition from Pauli statistics: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. The final state has T(NN) = 0. We need to find which partial wave is not permitted based on angular momentum and parity conservation.

First, let me parse the given information.

The initial state is 1S0. The term symbol is given as (2S+1)L(J). So for 1S0:
- The 1S part: 1 is (2S+1), so 2S+1=1 → S=0.
- L is S, which is 0. So the orbital angular momentum is 0. So the initial state has L=0, S=0, and J=0 (since J is the total angular momentum, which is L + S when they're coupled. So 0+0=0.)

So initial state: L_initial = 0, S_initial = 0, J_initial = 0.

Now, the system emits a particle X. Let's think about the process as an emission (maybe it's a decay or some interaction). The final state is the NN system in a certain state, and the emitted particle X.

So after emission, the NN system is in a state with some T, S, L (the problem refers to S as S(NN), but I think in this context, it might be the spin, not the state's S. Maybe I should clarify that. The question says T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. Hmm. Wait, T is the isospin, S is probably the spin, and L is the orbital angular momentum of the NN system after emission.

Given that the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So, T=0.

The Pauli condition given: T = S + L +1 mod 2.

So 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L = 1 mod 2 → S + L is odd.

So S and L must have opposite parity. So if S is even, L is odd; if S is odd, L is even.

Wait, but S is the total spin of the NN system. For two nucleons, how does their total spin behave? Well, for two spin-½ particles, the total spin can be S=0 or S=1.

So possible S values for the final state are S=0 or S=1.

But according to the condition, since T=0, and T = S (spin) + L +1 mod 2, then S + L = 1 mod 2. So either S is 1 and L is 0, or S is 0 and L is 1.

Wait, no: S + L must be 1 mod 2. So their sum is odd.

So possibilities:

If S=0, L must be 1 (since 0+1=1, which is odd).

If S=1, L must be 0 (since 1+0=1, which is odd).

So the final NN state will have either S=0 and L=1, or S=1 and L=0.

Now, let's think about the emitted particle X. It has intrinsic parity -1. The parity of the system before and after must be conserved, considering the emission.

The parity of a state is given by (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum of that state. But when a particle is emitted, the parity of the entire process (initial and final states) must be conserved.

Wait, but in particle emission, the parity of the initial state must equal the product of the parity of the final NN state and the parity of the emitted particle X, multiplied by (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum associated with the emission (the L of X's state).

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as an interaction. The initial state is the NN system in 1S0, which has L=0 and parity P_initial. Then, the NN system transitions to a new state (T=0, S and L as discussed) and emits X, which has orbital angular momentum l (lowercase l) in the emission process.

Wait, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle is important. Each option lists a lowercase letter, like p, s, etc., which correspond to the orbital angular momentum quantum number l. For example, s is l=0, p is l=1, d is l=2, f is l=3, etc.

So the emitted particle X has orbital angular momentum l. The total angular momentum must be conserved. Also, the parity must be conserved.

Let me think about parity first. The initial state has parity P_initial. The final state consists of the NN system (parity P_final) and the emitted particle X (parity P_X * (-1)^l, since X's parity is its intrinsic parity times (-1)^l.

Wait, no. The parity of a state is determined by the orbital angular momentum. So for any particle, its parity is intrinsic parity multiplied by (-1)^L, where L is its orbital angular momentum. So the emitted particle X has parity P_X = intrinsic_parity * (-1)^l.

In the initial state, the orbital angular momentum is L_initial =0. So the parity is (-1)^0 = 1.

In the final state, the NN system has orbital angular momentum L_final (could be 0 or 1 as per earlier possibilities). The parity of the NN system is P_NN = (-1)^L_final.

The emitted particle X has orbital angular momentum l (given in the options). Its parity is P_X = (-1)^l multiplied by its intrinsic parity, which is given as -1. So P_X = (-1)^l * (-1).

So overall, parity conservation requires that:

P_initial = P_NN * P_X * (-1)^L_emission ?

Wait, maybe I should model the process as a transition where the initial state (L_initial) splits into the final state (L_final for NN and l for X) with orbital angular momentum coupling.

But perhaps more accurately, the initial orbital angular momentum is L_initial, and the final is a combination of L_final (NN) and l (X). But since the system is emitting, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of X is added to the NN's orbital angular momentum?

Wait, maybe parity is conserved as P_initial = P_final_NN * P_X.

Wait, no. Because the initial state has parity P_initial = (-1)^{L_initial} = 1, since L_initial is 0.

The final state has two parts: the NN system and the X. The parity of the final state is the product of the parity of the NN system (which is (-1)^{L_final}) and the parity of X (which is (-1)^l * (-1), because X's intrinsic parity is -1).

So the parity conservation equation is:

1 = [ (-1)^{L_final} ] * [ (-1)^l * (-1) ) ]

Simplify that: 1 = (-1)^{L_final + l + 1}.

Which implies that (-1)^{L_final + l + 1} = 1 → L_final + l +1 must be even.

So L_final + l = odd → because adding 1 to an even number gives odd, which would make the exponent even again. Wait, let me double-check:

Wait, 1 = (-1)^n → n must be even.

So L_final + l +1 must be even → L_final + l must be odd.

So L_final + l is odd.

So (L_final + l) mod 2 = 1.

Now, let's consider the two possibilities for L_final based on earlier analysis.

Case 1: S=0 → L_final =1.

Case 2: S=1 → L_final=0.

Let's evaluate each case with the options.

The options are:

A) 1S0 →7D1 + p

So the emitted particle has l=1 (p state).

So l=1.

In this option, the emitted X is in a p state, so l=1.

The final NN state is 7D1. Wait, but wait, the term symbol is given as (2S+1)LJ. So 7D1 would have (2S+1)=7 → S=3 (since 2*3+1=7). L is D, which is 2. J is 1.

Wait, but wait, the final NN state's orbital angular momentum is L_final = 2 (D state is L=2).

So for this case, L_final =2.

Wait, but earlier we thought that L_final can be either 0 or 1. Hmm. That's conflicting. Because in the Pauli condition, when T=0, S + L must be 1 mod 2. So if L_final is 2, then S must be 1 (because 2 is even, so L=2. So S + 2 must be odd → S must be 1 (since 1 + 2=3, which is odd).

But wait, wait, in case 1, S=0 and L_final=1. In case 2, S=1 and L_final=0.

So the final NN state's L can be 0 or 1. So if an option has L_final=2, that would mean T(NN) can't be 0, unless perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, but looking at option A: the final state is 7D1. So the orbital angular momentum L is 2. So for the final state, L_final=2. But earlier, only L_final=0 or 1 is allowed when T=0.

So that would imply that option A can't be a valid process, as L_final=2 would require T(NN) to be 1, perhaps. Because for T=0, L_final must be 0 or 1.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the Pauli condition.

The condition given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2.

Wait, no. The condition is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2.

Wait, earlier I thought T=0, so S + L +1 ≡0 mod 2 → S+L ≡1 mod 2.

So S and L must sum to 1 mod 2. So either S=0, L=1; S=1, L=0; etc.

So for the final state, the NN's L can be either 0 or 1, depending on S.

So in option A, which is 7D1, that implies L_final=2, which is not allowed. So that would make option A not permitted, perhaps. But I should check all options.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the orbital angular momentum of the final state with the emitted particle's orbital momentum. Let me proceed methodically.

Let me list all options and check each one.

Option A: 1S0 → 7D1 + p.

So initial state is 1S0 (L=0). Final state after emission is 7D1 (so L_final=2), and emits X in p state (l=1).

So for this option, check if T=0 is possible.

But wait, for the final NN state, T=0, so S + L_final must be 1 mod 2.

If L_final=2, then S must be 1 (since 1+2=3 ≡1 mod 2).

So S=1.

So the final NN state has S=1, L=2.

Now, check the parity condition.

The parity equation was L_final + l must be odd.

L_final=2, l=1 → sum is 3, which is odd. So parity is conserved.

But wait, wait, earlier I thought that the Pauli condition requires L_final to be either 0 or 1 when T=0. But in this case, L_final=2 is possible if S=1.

Wait, no. Because according to the condition, T=0 → S + L_final must be 1 mod 2.

If L_final=2 (which is even), then S must be odd, so S=1.

So that's possible.

But wait, the options are about the emitted particle's orbital state and the final NN state. So how does the angular momentum come into play?

Wait, but the problem is about which partial wave is not permitted. The options give the final NN state and the emitted particle's state. So perhaps the angular momentum must also be conserved.

So the initial state has J_initial=0.

The final state is the NN system with J_final and the emitted particle X with j (which is j = l + s, but assuming X's spin is negligible or given, but perhaps we can focus on the orbital part for now, or perhaps the total angular momentum.

Wait, but the initial total angular momentum is J_initial =0.

In the final state, the NN system has J_final and X has j. So the total angular momentum must be J_final + j.

But since the initial J is 0, the total J_final + j must be 0, so J_final = -j, but that's only possible if j=0 as well. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the total angular momentum must be conserved vectorially. So the initial J=0 must equal the vector sum of the final J_NN and J_X.

But maybe that's complicating things beyond the scope required. The problem states that the options are about the partial wave (i.e., the orbital angular momentum l of X), so perhaps we're focusing on orbital angular momentum conservation.

Alternatively, perhaps only the orbital angular momentum is considered when discussing partial waves, so the spin part is not considered here.

Wait, but in any case, perhaps I should proceed step by step for each option.

Let me make a table to evaluate each option.

Option A: 1S0 →7D1 + p.

- Initial L_initial =0, S_initial=0, J_initial=0.

- Final NN state: 7D1 → L_final=2, S_final=3 (from 2S+1=7 → S=3).

Wait, wait, 2S+1=7 → S=3.

So for the final NN state, S=3, L=2.

Then, T=0 → S + L +1 mod 2 = 3 +2 +1=6 mod 2=0. Which fits.

So T=0 condition is satisfied.

Now, parity condition: L_final + l = 2 +1=3 → odd. So parity is conserved.

But wait, is the spin and orbital angular momentum correctly considering the allowed states?

Wait, but the problem is about the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum. So perhaps the process is that the NN system emits X with orbital angular momentum l, thus the orbital angular momentum of the NN system changes from L_initial=0 to L_final.

So the initial orbital angular momentum is 0.

The final NN orbital angular momentum is L_final, and the emitted particle has orbital angular momentum l.

So the total orbital angular momentum after emission is L_final + l (vectorially), but for conservation, the initial L_initial must equal the vector sum of L_final and l.

Wait, but the initial L is 0. So the vector sum of L_final and l must be zero. That implies that L_final and l must have the same magnitude and opposite directions. But since they're quantum numbers, perhaps their magnitudes must be equal and their directions opposite, but that's not possible unless both are zero. But L_final can't be zero if l is non-zero, unless perhaps the orbital angular momenta add up vectorially to zero, which would require specific conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum is conserved in magnitude, but considering the possibility of different l and L_final. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps instead of considering the orbital angular momentum conservation, the problem is focused on the parity and Pauli condition, and using that to eliminate impossible options.

So, for each option, check:

1. Whether the final NN state's T=0 is possible (i.e., whether S + L_final is 1 mod 2).

2. Whether parity is conserved (L_final + l is odd).

3. Whether the angular momentum is conserved, but perhaps that's beyond the current approach.

Let's proceed with each option.

Option A: 7D1 + p.

- Final NN L=2, S=3.

So T=0 → S + L +1 =3+2+1=6 → 0 mod 2. So condition holds.

Parity: L_final=2, l=1 → sum=3 → odd. So parity conserved.

So this option is allowed. So not the answer.

Wait, but wait, the initial state is 1S0 (L=0, S=0, J=0). The final NN state is 7D1: L=2, S=3, J=1.

So the initial J is 0, and the final J is 1 (for the NN) plus the spin of X. Hmm, but perhaps this is more complicated.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is only considering orbital angular momentum, not total. Hmm.

Option B: 3S1 + p.

So the final NN state is 3S1. So, term symbol is (2S+1)LJ.

3S1 → 2S+1=3 → S=1. L is S (from spectroscopic notation), which is 0? Wait wait no, the term symbol is (2S+1)LJ. So 3S1 would be S=1, L is S? No, wait, L is determined by the letter. S is orbital angular momentum 0, P=1, D=2, etc. So 3S1 would have L=0 (because S in the term symbol refers to the orbital angular momentum. Wait, no. The term symbol is (2S+1)L J. So L is the orbital angular momentum. So 3S1 → L=0 (because S refers to the orbital angular momentum in the term symbol? Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. The term is written as (2S+1)L J, where S is the total spin, L is the orbital angular momentum, and J is the total angular momentum.

So 1S0 → S=0, L=0, J=0.

3S1 → 2S+1=3 → S=1. L is denoted by the letter. In this case, 'S' is the orbital letter, which corresponds to L=0. So the final NN state has S=1, L=0.

So L_final=0.

So checking the Pauli condition: T=0 → S + L +1 =1 +0 +1=2 → mod 2 is 0. So condition holds.

Parity: L_final=0, l=1 (p state).

So 0 +1=1 → odd. So parity is conserved.

So this option is allowed.

Option C: 3D3 + f.

Final NN state is 3D3. So term symbol: (2S+1)L J.

3D3 → 2S+1=3 → S=1. L is D → L=2. J=3.

So L_final=2.

T=0 → S + L +1 =1 +2 +1=4 → mod 2 is 0. Condition holds.

Parity: L_final=2, l=3 (f state).

So 2+3=5 → odd. So parity is conserved.

So this option is allowed.

Option D: 3P0 + s.

3P0: (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L is P→ L=1. J=0.

So L_final=1.

T=0 → S + L +1 =1 +1 +1=3 → mod 2 is 1. Wait, but T=0 requires S + L +1 ≡0 mod 2.

Wait 1+1+1=3 mod 2 is 1, which is not 0. So this would imply T=1, which contradicts T=0 as given.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the problem states that the final state has T=0, so this option would not satisfy the Pauli condition.

Wait, let me re-calculate.

S=1, L=1.

T = S + L +1 mod 2 → T =1 +1 +1 mod 2 →3 mod 2=1. But the problem says T=0.

So this option would have T=1, which is not allowed. So D is not permitted.

But wait, let me check the parity for D.

Parity: L_final=1, l=0 (s state).

1 +0=1 → odd. So parity is conserved.

But the Pauli condition is not met because T would be 1, not 0. So option D is not allowed.

Wait, but wait, the problem says that the final state has T=0. So any option that doesn't satisfy T=0 is invalid.

So, looking back:

Option D: 3P0.

S=1, L=1 → T=1+1+1 mod 2 =3 mod 2=1 → T=1. But the problem states T=0. So this option isn't allowed.

But I should check whether I made a mistake in the calculation earlier.

Wait, the condition is T = S + L +1 mod 2.

Wait, no, the condition given is T = S + L +1 mod 2.

So for option D:

S=1, L=1.

So T= 1 +1 +1 mod 2=3 mod2=1.

But the problem states T=0. So this option can't happen. So this would mean option D is not permitted.

Wait, but earlier I thought that L_final=2 is allowed if S=1, but according to the condition, for T=0, when L_final=2, S must be 1.

Wait, but in option D, the final state has L=1, S=1 → T=1, which is not allowed. So D is invalid.

Wait, but let me check option B again.

Option B: 3S1 +p.

So the final NN state has S=1, L=0.

So T =1 +0 +1 =2 mod2=0 → correct.

Parity: L_final=0, l=1 → 0+1=1 → odd. So parity is conserved.

So option B is allowed.

So which options are allowed and which are not?

Looking at all options:

A) L_final=2, S=3 → T=0 → allowed.

B) L_final=0, S=1 → T=0 → allowed.

C) L_final=2, S=1 → T=0 → allowed.

D) L_final=1, S=1 → T=1 → not allowed.

So option D is the one that does not satisfy the Pauli condition, as T would be 1, but the problem says T=0.

Wait, but let me look back. The question is which partial wave is not permitted. But the options specify the emitted particle's orbital state. So perhaps I should also check angular momentum conservation.

Wait, the initial state has J=0. The final state's J must be zero.

The final NN state has J= some value, and the emitted X has j (which includes spin, but perhaps orbital part is l).

Wait, perhaps the approach is to consider that the total angular momentum must be conserved. So initial J=0 → final J_NN + J_X =0.

But J_NN is the total angular momentum of the NN system, and J_X is the total angular momentum of X (including spin). But perhaps for this problem, we're considering only the orbital angular momentum, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of the NN system and the emitted particle must sum up to the initial orbital angular momentum, which is zero.

So, initial orbital angular momentum L_initial=0.

After emission, the NN has L_final and the X has l. So L_initial must equal L_final + l vectorially, but since L_initial is zero, the vector sum must be zero. So L_final and l must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, which is only possible if both are zero. But that can't be the case because the emitted particle has l.

Wait, this would imply that L_final = -l → but since they're quantum numbers, their magnitudes must be the same and their directions opposite, but that's not possible unless both are zero, which they aren't. So perhaps this is the key to which options are allowed.

Wait, but then in that case, all options except those where L_final + l equals zero (in magnitude) would be invalid.

Wait, but the initial orbital angular momentum is zero, so the sum of the final orbital angular momenta must be zero. Thus, the NN's L_final and the X's l must be such that their vector sum is zero. But for this to be possible, L_final and l must have the same magnitude and opposite directions. So L_final = l.

So L_final= l.

Wait, but that's only possible if L_final and l are the same. But looking at the options:

Option A: L_final=2, l=1 → 2≠1 → impossible.

Option B: L_final=0, l=1 → 0≠1 → impossible.

Option C: L_final=2, l=3 → 2≠3 → impossible.

Option D: L_final=1, l=0 → 1≠0 → impossible.

Wait, but this suggests that none of the options are allowed, which can't be correct. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the orbital angular momentum of the NN and the emitted particle are in opposite directions, so their magnitudes add up to zero vectorially. But that's not possible unless they have the same magnitude and opposite directions. But in quantum terms, the magnitudes must be the same. So L_final must equal l. But looking at the options, none of them have L_final equal to l.

Wait, this is confusing. Perhaps I'm overcomplicating things. Let me try to think differently.

The problem states that the emitted particle has intrinsic parity -1. So the parity of X is (-1)^(l) * (-1) → (-1)^(l+1).

The initial state has parity 1.

The final state's parity is the product of the NN's parity and the X's parity.

The parity of the NN's state is (-1)^L_final.

So parity conservation: 1 = (-1)^L_final * [ (-1)^(l+1) ] → 1 = (-1)^(L_final + l +1).

Which implies that L_final + l + 1 must be even → L_final + l is odd.

Which brings us back to the earlier condition.

So, for each option:

Option A: L_final=2, l=1 → sum=3 → odd → allowed.

Option B: L_final=0, l=1 → sum=1 → odd → allowed.

Option C: L_final=2, l=3 → sum=5 → odd → allowed.

Option D: L_final=1, l=0 → sum=1 → odd → allowed.

So all options satisfy the parity condition. But then why is the question asking which is not permitted?

Ah, perhaps the Pauli condition is the key. So let's recheck each option's Pauli condition.

Option A: S=3, L_final=2.

T =3 +2 +1 mod2 →6 mod2=0 → allowed.

Option B: S=1, L_final=0.

T=1+0+1=2 mod2=0 → allowed.

Option C: S=1, L_final=2.

T=1+2+1=4 mod2=0 → allowed.

Option D: S=1, L_final=1.

T=1+1+1=3 mod2=1 → not allowed. So T=1, but the problem states T=0. So this option is not allowed.

So the partial wave in option D would not be permitted because it violates the Pauli condition (T=1 instead of 0), regardless of the parity condition.

So the answer would be option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which partial wave is not permitted, we analyze the given conditions and each option systematically:

### Key Information and Conditions:
1. **Initial State**: The NN system is in the 1S0 state:
   - \( L_{\text{initial}} = 0 \), \( S_{\text{initial}} = 0 \), \( J_{\text{initial}} = 0 \).
   - Parity of the initial state: \( P_{\text{initial}} = (-1)^{L_{\text{initial}}} = 1 \).

2. **Final State**: The NN system transitions to a state with \( T_{\text{NN}} = 0 \).
   - Pauli condition: \( T_{\text{NN}} = S_{\text{NN}} + L_{\text{NN}} + 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \).
   - For \( T_{\text{NN}} = 0 \), \( S_{\text{NN}} + L_{\text{NN}} \) must be odd.

3. **Emission of Particle X**:
   - Particle X has intrinsic parity \(-1\), so its parity is \( P_X = (-1)^l \cdot (-1) \), where \( l \) is the orbital angular momentum of X.
   - Parity conservation: \( P_{\text{initial}} = P_{\text{NN}} \cdot P_X \), where \( P_{\text{NN}} = (-1)^{L_{\text{NN}}} \).

4. **Angular Momentum Conservation**:
   - The initial orbital angular momentum is \( L_{\text{initial}} = 0 \).
   - After emission, the total orbital angular momentum must satisfy \( L_{\text{NN}} + l = 0 \) vectorially. This implies \( L_{\text{NN}} = l \) in magnitude.

### Analysis of Each Option:
#### **Option A: \( 1S0 \to 7D1 + p \)**
- Final NN state: \( 7D1 \), so \( S_{\text{NN}} = 3 \) (from \( 2S+1 = 7 \)), \( L_{\text{NN}} = 2 \) (D state).
- Pauli condition: \( T_{\text{NN}} = S_{\text{NN}} + L_{\text{NN}} + 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \).
  - \( T_{\text{NN}} = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 \, (\text{mod } 2) = 0 \), which satisfies \( T_{\text{NN}} = 0 \).
- Parity conservation: \( L_{\text{NN}} + l = 2 + 1 = 3 \), which is odd. Parity is conserved.
- Angular momentum conservation: \( L_{\text{NN}} = 2 \), \( l = 1 \). \( L_{\text{NN}} \neq l \), so angular momentum is not conserved. **This option is not allowed.**

#### **Option B: \( 1S0 \to 3S1 + p \)**
- Final NN state: \( 3S1 \), so \( S_{\text{NN}} = 1 \) (from \( 2S+1 = 3 \)), \( L_{\text{NN}} = 0 \) (S state).
- Pauli condition: \( T_{\text{NN}} = S_{\text{NN}} + L_{\text{NN}} + 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \).
  - \( T_{\text{NN}} = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2 \, (\text{mod } 2) = 0 \), which satisfies \( T_{\text{NN}} = 0 \).
- Parity conservation: \( L_{\text{NN}} + l = 0 + 1 = 1 \), which is odd. Parity is conserved.
- Angular momentum conservation: \( L_{\text{NN}} = 0 \), \( l = 1 \). \( L_{\text{NN}} \neq l \), so angular momentum is not conserved. **This option is not allowed.**

#### **Option C: \( 1S0 \to 3D3 + f \)**
- Final NN state: \( 3D3 \), so \( S_{\text{NN}} = 1 \) (from \( 2S+1 = 3 \)), \( L_{\text{NN}} = 2 \) (D state).
- Pauli condition: \( T_{\text{NN}} = S_{\text{NN}} + L_{\text{NN}} + 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \).
  - \( T_{\text{NN}} = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 \, (\text{mod } 2) = 0 \), which satisfies \( T_{\text{NN}} = 0 \).
- Parity conservation: \( L_{\text{NN}} + l = 2 + 3 = 5 \), which is odd. Parity is conserved.
- Angular momentum conservation: \( L_{\text{NN}} = 2 \), \( l = 3 \). \( L_{\text{NN}} \neq l \), so angular momentum is not conserved. **This option is not allowed.**

#### **Option D: \( 1S0 \to 3P0 + s \)**
- Final NN state: \( 3P0 \), so \( S_{\text{NN}} = 1 \) (from \( 2S+1 = 3 \)), \( L_{\text{NN}} = 1 \) (P state).
- Pauli condition: \( T_{\text{NN}} = S_{\text{NN}} + L_{\text{NN}} + 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \).
  - \( T_{\text{NN}} = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \, (\text{mod } 2) = 1 \), which does not satisfy \( T_{\text{NN}} = 0 \). **This option is not allowed.**

### Conclusion:
The partial wave that is not permitted is **Option D**, as it violates the Pauli condition (\( T_{\text{NN}} = 1 \) instead of \( T_{\text{NN}} = 0 \)).

**Answer: D**
