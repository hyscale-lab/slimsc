Okay, so I've got this electrochemistry question here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about the properties of oxygen as an oxidant in different solutions—basic and acidic. It's a fill-in-the-blank with two parts: thermodynamic and kinetic aspects. The options are combinations of whether oxygen is a stronger or weaker oxidant and whether it reacts faster or slower.

Hmm, I remember that in electrochemistry, the strength of an oxidant relates to its standard electrode potential. A higher (more positive) potential means it's a stronger oxidizing agent. So, in basic solutions, how does O2 behave?

Wait, O2 is involved in the oxygen electrode. The half-reaction for O2 in basic solution is O2 + 2H2O + 4e- → 4OH-, and the standard potential is around +0.401 V. In acidic solution, the same O2 would have a half-reaction of O2 + 4H+ +4e- → 2H2O, with a standard potential of +1.23 V.

Oh right, the standard potential is higher in acidic solution. So thermodynamically, that means O2 is a stronger oxidizing agent in acidic solution because E° is higher there. Wait, wait, wait—no wait, the question is about basic solutions. Wait the first blank is about basic solutions, and the second about acidic.

So in basic solutions, O2's E° is +0.401 V. But wait, when comparing to the hydrogen electrode, perhaps? Wait, the reference point. If O2 as an oxidant is compared in basic versus acidic, in basic, the E° is lower than in acidic. So in basic, it's a weaker oxidant compared to when it's in acidic solution. Because a higher E° means a stronger oxidant.

So the first part: Thermodynamically, oxygen is a weaker oxidant in basic solutions. Because its E° is lower there than in acidic.

Now the second part: Kinetically, how does O2 react in acidic vs. basic? Kinetics are about reaction rates, which depend on activation energy and conditions.

I remember that O2's reaction can be slow in solution because it's not very soluble. But wait, in acidic solutions, the reaction might be faster because H+ ions can help in the reaction. Or wait, maybe the reaction is more kinetically favorable in basic conditions? Hmm.

Wait, the reaction of O2 as an oxidant in acidic versus basic. Maybe it's related to the solubility of O2. O2 is more soluble in water under certain conditions, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps in acidic solutions, the reaction is faster because of the presence of H+ ions that might facilitate the reaction. Or maybe the reaction is slower because the solution is acidic, which could affect the rate.

Wait, another angle: the overall reaction in basic solution is O2 + 2H2O + 4e- → 4OH-. In acidic, it's O2 + 4H+ +4e- → 2H2O. So in acidic solution, the reaction involves H+ ions. H+ might increase the reaction rate because they can help in the reaction mechanism. Like, maybe the H+ ions help in the protonation steps, making the reaction proceed faster.

So kinetically, in acidic solution, the reaction is faster. Because the presence of H+ could lower the activation energy, making the reaction proceed more quickly.

Putting it together: Thermodynamically, O2 is a weaker oxidant in basic solutions (since E° is lower there), and kinetically, it reacts faster in acidic solutions.

Now, looking at the options:

Option C) weaker – faster
Option B) stronger – slower

Wait, the first blank is about basic solutions. So in basic, O2 is a weaker oxidant (so first part is weaker). The second part is about acidic solutions, so the reaction is faster in acidic. So the second part is faster.

Looking at the options, option C says weaker and faster. Let me see the options:

A) stronger – faster → no, first part is weaker.

B) stronger – slower → no.

C) weaker – faster → yes.

D) weaker - slower → no.

So the correct answer should be C) weaker – faster.

In electrochemistry, the strength of an oxidant is determined by its standard electrode potential (E°). For oxygen (O₂), the half-reaction in basic solution is:

\[
\text{O}_2 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} + 4\text{e}^- \rightarrow 4\text{OH}^-, \quad E^\circ = +0.401 \, \text{V}.
\]

In acidic solution, the half-reaction is:

\[
\text{O}_2 + 4\text{H}^+ + 4\text{e}^- \rightarrow 2\text{H}_2\text{O}, \quad E^\circ = +1.23 \, \text{V}.
\]

From this, it is evident that the standard electrode potential is higher in acidic solution, meaning O₂ is a stronger oxidant in acidic solutions compared to basic solutions. Therefore, thermodynamically, oxygen is a weaker oxidant in basic solutions.

Kinetically, the reaction rate depends on factors like solubility and the presence of ions that lower the activation energy. In acidic solutions, the reaction involves H⁺ ions, which can facilitate the reaction mechanism, making the reaction proceed faster. Thus, kinetically, oxygen reacts faster in acidic solutions.

Combining these observations:
1. Thermodynamically, oxygen is a weaker oxidant in basic solutions.
2. Kinetically, oxygen reacts faster in acidic solutions.

The correct combination is "weaker – faster," which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
