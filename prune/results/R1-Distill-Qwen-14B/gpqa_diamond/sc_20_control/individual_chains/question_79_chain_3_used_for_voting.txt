Okay, so I have this question about identifying a compound based on its NMR spectra after a reaction. Hmm, let me try to work through this step by step.

First, the question says that compound X (C11H12O) was reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR data is given, and I need to determine what compound X was.

Wait, what's 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane? Oh right, that's a common reagent used in the epoxidation of alkenes. Specifically, it's used in the Prilezhaev epoxidation, which is an acid-catalyzed reaction. So this reaction probably adds an epoxide group to a double bond in compound X.

Compound X is C11H12O. The product after epoxidation would have an additional oxygen from the reagent, so the formula would be C11H10O3? Or wait, no. Let me check. The reagent is 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which is a catalyst, right? Or is it part of the reaction? No, wait, the reaction is epoxidation. The reagent is probably the oxidizing agent. So the oxygen comes from another source, like maybe a peroxide? Alternatively, the reagent itself could contribute an oxygen. Wait, no, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a bicyclic amine, so it doesn't add oxygen. Hmm, maybe the epoxide oxygen comes from a peracid or another oxygen source. Hmm, perhaps I should focus on the product's NMR.

Looking at the product's 1H NMR:
- δ 2.28 (3H, s) and 2.31 (3H, s): These look like two equivalent singlets, each for three protons. Maybe two methyl groups attached to something that doesn't cause splitting, like carbonyls or aromatic rings. Alternatively, they could be adjacent to an electronegative atom. Wait, but they're singlets, so no neighboring protons. So perhaps two methyl groups attached to something like carbonyl carbons or maybe as substituents on an aromatic ring.

Then, aromatic signals:
- 6.75 (1H, d)
- 7.08 (2H, d)
- 7.68 (1H, d)
- 7.71 (2H, d)
Wait, that's four signals in the aromatic region. Let me count: 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 6 protons. So maybe a para-substituted benzene ring or something with multiple substituents.

Looking at the 13C NMR data:
- 21.3 (1C, s): This is a very low shift, probably a methyl group attached to something. Maybe a CH3 next to an oxygen, like in an epoxide. Or perhaps a methyl attached to a carbonyl, but 21 is more like a methyl in an alkyl group.
- 28.4 (1C, s): Another low shift, perhaps another CH3 group but maybe attached differently.
- The rest are carbons in the aromatic region and possibly an epoxide.

Wait, the product has an epoxide group since the reaction is epoxidation. So the product would be an epoxide, so the starting material must have a double bond.

So the product's NMR shows an epoxide. Let me think about the structure. An epoxide would have two adjacent carbons each bonded to an oxygen. The 13C NMR has a peak at 197.7, which is a high shift. Hmm, 197 is more typical of a carbonyl, like a ketone or ester. Wait, but epoxide carbons are usually around 50-70 ppm. Oh, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, the 13C NMR has a peak at 197.7, which is a carbonyl. Oh, maybe the product isn't an epoxide but something else. Hmm, but the reaction is with 1,4-diazabicyclo... which is used for epoxidation. So perhaps the product is an epoxide with another functional group, like a ketone?

Alternatively, maybe the compound has both an epoxide and another carbonyl group. Let me look again.

Wait, the product's molecular formula isn't given, but the starting material is C11H12O. After epoxidation, the product would have an epoxide group. So let's think about that.

Epoxide groups in 1H NMR usually show up as broad peaks around 3-4 ppm, but maybe in a nonpolar solvent, the peaks could be sharp. Alternatively, sometimes the epoxide protons can be deshielded and appear as a doublet or something else. But in the given 1H NMR, there are no obvious protons around 3-4 ppm. Hmm, maybe the epoxide is part of an aromatic structure or in a position where the protons are not observed, or perhaps the epoxide has no protons (like a cyclopropane oxide, but that's unusual). Wait, no, epoxides have two adjacent CH2 groups, so they have protons. So why don't I see them in the given NMR?

Wait, maybe the epoxide is part of a ring that doesn't have protons? No, that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the product. Alternatively, maybe the epoxide is part of a larger ring system where the protons are downfield shifted.

Wait, let me look again. The 1H NMR doesn't have any signals in the 3-4 ppm region. Maybe the epoxide is part of a more substituted system where the protons are integrated into other regions.

Alternatively, perhaps the product has an epoxide but the protons are split or maybe the NMR is for the starting material, not the product? Wait, no, the question says the theoretical spectra of the resulting product.

Hmm, perhaps I should try to figure out the structure from the NMR.

Looking at the 1H NMR:

- Two singlets, 3H each: possibly two methyl groups attached to something that doesn't split them (like two CH3 groups attached to an aromatic ring, but that would usually cause splitting if adjacent to other protons. Or perhaps they're attached to carbonyls.

Wait, in an epoxide, the adjacent carbons would each have two protons. But if the epoxide is part of a larger ring or structure, maybe those protons are not observed. Alternatively, maybe the epoxide is part of a substituent where the protons are in a different region.

Wait, maybe the two singlet methyl groups are part of a gem-dimethyl structure. Like, two methyl groups attached to the same carbon. But how would that fit into an epoxide? Alternatively, perhaps it's a carbonyl group with two methyl groups adjacent, like a ketone with two methyl substituents.

Wait, looking at the 13C NMR, there's a peak at 197.7, which is a carbonyl. So that's probably a ketone. Oh wait, but epoxidation would add an oxygen but not a ketone. Hmm, unless the starting material had a ketone and a double bond, and something else happened, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the starting material is C11H12O, so after reaction, perhaps it's C11H10O2 or something similar. But the product's structure is needed.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide with a substituent that includes a ketone. Wait, but then the 13C would show the ketone, which it does at 197.7.

Looking at the 13C NMR, the carbons at 126.9 (2C), 127.1 (1C), 129.1 (2C), 130.3 (1C), 141.5 (1C), 144.1 (1C). These are all in the aromatic region.

So perhaps the product has an aromatic ring with substituents. Let's see: two doublets (each 2H and 1H), so maybe a para-substituted ring with another group attached. Or perhaps it's a meta substitution.

Wait, the aromatic protons in the 1H NMR are:

δ 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

Wait, that's four peaks. Let me think about coupling. The 7.71 (2H, d) and 7.68 (1H, d) must be coupled with each other. Similarly, 6.75 (1H, d) and 7.08 (2H, d) could be coupled.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a di-substituted benzene where each substituent has a double bond.

Wait, the product is an epoxide, so maybe the starting material had a styrene group (vinyl benzene). So, epoxidation would convert the double bond into an epoxide.

So, let's imagine the starting material is a styrene derivative with an epoxide now.

Wait, but the product has a ketone (the 197.7 ppm peak). Oh, maybe the starting material had a carbonyl group as well. So perhaps it's a styryl ketone or something.

Wait, perhaps the product is a styrene oxide. But styrene oxide would have an epoxide ring, which would have two CH2 groups adjacent to the oxygen. The protons on those CH2 would usually show up around 3-4 ppm. But in the given 1H NMR, there's no such signals, which is confusing.

Wait, but the 1H NMR has signals starting at 2.28 and 2.31 for the methyl groups. Maybe the epoxide is part of a ring where the adjacent carbons are each attached to methyl groups. So like, in a six-membered ring, the epoxide is at positions 1 and 2, each attached to a methyl group. But that would mean the epoxide has two CH2 groups, but if each CH2 has a methyl, that would be possible? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an epoxide attached to a benzene ring, with substituents that have the two methyl groups.

Wait, let me think about the options. The options are four, each with an oxirane (epoxide) group.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane

B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane

C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane

D) 2-styrylepoxide

Wait, let's think about each option.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. So the oxirane (epoxide) is at position 2, and the substituent is a styryl group (vinyl benzene) attached at the 4-methyl position. So the structure would be an epoxide ring with a vinyl benzene substituent where the benzene has a methyl group in the para position.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. So the substituent is a propenyl group attached to the epoxide. The propenyl group is substituted with a phenyl group at position 1 and a methyl group at position 2.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. The oxirane is at position 2, with a methyl group at position 2 and a styryl group at position 3.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. This is the epoxide with a styryl group attached at position 2. So the epoxide is attached to the benzene ring via a vinyl group.

Wait, but the product's NMR shows two singlet methyl groups. Let's look at each option and see if they have methyl groups.

Option A: The substituent is 4-methylstyryl. So the benzene has a methyl in the para position. So the structure would have that methyl as a substituent on the benzene. So in the NMR, that methyl would be a singlet, perhaps around 2.3 ppm. So that fits the two singlet methyls. Wait, but option A only has one methyl (the 4-methyl on the styryl group). So that would mean only one singlet for the methyl, but the product's NMR shows two. So perhaps option A is not the correct one.

Option B: The substituent is 1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl. So the structure would be a prop-1-en-2-yl group attached to the epoxide, which is substituted with a phenyl at position 1. So the substituent would be CH2-C(Ph)=CH2? Wait, no. Wait, 1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl would be Ph-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=CH-CH2-, but with a phenyl attached to the first carbon. So the structure would be Ph-CH2-CH2-CH2-Oxirane? No, wait, the substituent is attached to the epoxide. So the epoxide would have a substituent like (Ph)C=CH2 attached to it. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is (Ph)C(CH2Oxirane)=CH2? Hmm, perhaps the structure would have a methyl group somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent has a methyl group attached to the central carbon of the propenyl group. So in that case, the substituent would have a CH(CH2Oxirane)=CHPh group? But I'm not sure. Alternatively, this option might not have any methyl groups, which doesn't fit the NMR.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. So the epoxide is at position 2, and there's a methyl group at position 2 (so maybe on the same carbon as the oxygen), and a styryl group at position 3. Wait, the styryl group is a vinyl benzene. So the structure would be Oxirane with a methyl at position 2 and a styryl group at position 3. So the epoxide is between carbons 2 and 3, with a methyl on carbon 2 and a styryl group on carbon 3. That would mean that the epoxide has a methyl group on one of the adjacent carbons, so the protons on that carbon would be a singlet. But wait, the other carbon (position 3) would have a styryl group. So in 1H NMR, the methyl would be a singlet, which is observed. Also, the styryl group would give aromatic protons. But would this structure account for two methyl groups? Or just one? Because the starting material is C11H12O, after epoxidation, the product would have more oxygens. But in any case, looking at the NMR, there are two singlet methyls. So if option C has one methyl (the 2-methyl group), that wouldn't explain the two singlets.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. So the epoxide is attached to a styryl group at position 2. So the structure is an epoxide with a vinyl benzene attached to one of the epoxide carbons. So the other carbon in the epoxide would be attached to something else. Wait, but in this structure, where would the methyl groups come from? The product's NMR shows two singlet methyl groups. So D might not have any methyl groups, which would mean this option is unlikely.

Wait, but the starting material has two methyl groups. Or perhaps I'm getting confused between the product and the starting material. Let me think again.

The starting material is X, which is C11H12O. After reaction, the product would have an epoxide, making it C11H10O2 perhaps, but the exact formula isn't given. The product's NMR shows two singlet methyl groups. So where would those methyl groups come from?

Ah, maybe the starting material had a double bond that is converted into an epoxide, and the substituents on the double bond are what give the two methyl groups in the product.

Wait, let's think about the product structure. The product has two methyl groups (2.28 and 2.31 ppm, singlets). These could be attached to carbonyl groups or to other groups that don't cause splitting. 

Looking at the 13C NMR, there's a carbon at 197.7, which is a carbonyl. So there's a ketone group in the product. Wait, but the reaction is epoxidation, which typically doesn't introduce ketones. So perhaps the starting material had a ketone and an alkene, and the epoxidation occurred elsewhere.

Wait, but the starting material is C11H12O. If the product has a carbonyl, that would add another oxygen. So the product would be C11H10O2? Or if the starting material had another oxygen, but no, the starting material is only C11H12O.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently. The two singlet methyl groups in the 1H NMR (3H each) likely indicate they are attached to something that doesn't have adjacent protons, like a quaternary carbon. So perhaps they're attached to carbonyl groups, like in a ketone.

Wait, but the product's 13C NMR has a peak at 197.7, which is a carbonyl. So there's a ketone. But the reaction is epoxidation; how does that lead to a ketone?

Hmm, maybe the starting material had a cyclopropane ring and the reaction opened it. But that's not likely with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which is used for epoxidation.

Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide is part of a cyclic ketone. Wait, but that's not common.

Wait, perhaps the starting material had a conjugated diene, and the reaction led to a cyclic ether with a ketone. I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a bicyclic compound, but without more information, it's hard to say.

Let me consider the options again. The product's NMR shows two singlet methyl groups. So among the options, which ones have two methyl groups?

Looking at the options:

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. The styryl group has a methyl in para. So the structure would have one CH3 on the benzene ring. So the NMR would show a singlet for that CH3, but where is the other methyl? Hmm, unless there's another methyl somewhere else.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. The substituent is a propenyl group with a phenyl at one end and a methyl (if any) in the middle. Wait, the substituent is 1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl, which is Ph-C=CH-Oxirane? No, the substituent would be (Ph)C=CH2 attached to the epoxide carbon? Or is it (Ph)C(CH2-Oxirane)=CH2? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me draw it:

The substituent is 1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl. So the structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-CH2-Oxirane? No, wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=CHCH2-. So 1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl would be Ph-C=CH-CH2-Oxirane? Or is the substituent a group where the epoxide is attached to the middle carbon of the propenyl group, which itself is attached to a phenyl group?

Alternatively, perhaps it's Ph-C(CH2-Oxirane)=CH2. In this case, the middle carbon has the phenyl and the epoxide substituent. So that would give a structure where the CH2 groups are part of the epoxide. But in that case, the substituent on the epoxide would have a CH2 group adjacent to the double bond. But would that lead to any new methyl groups? Not unless there's a methyl substituent on the propenyl group. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. So the structure has a methyl group on the epoxide carbon (position 2) and a styryl group on position 3. So the epoxide connects positions 2 and 3. The styryl group is a vinyl benzene. So the structure would be Oxirane where one carbon (C2) is attached to a methyl and another carbon (C3) is attached to a vinyl benzene. So the NMR would show the methyl as a singlet (since it's attached to a quaternary carbon, perhaps), and the styryl group would give aromatic protons. But where is the second methyl in the NMR data? Because option C has only one methyl.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. So the epoxide is attached to a styryl group. So the structure is an epoxide where one carbon is attached to a vinyl benzene. The other epoxide carbon is connected to the other part of the molecule. But in this case, where would the methyl groups come from? Unless the vinyl group has substituents.

Wait, perhaps the starting material had a double bond next to a carbonyl group. For example, if the starting material was a styrylketone, and the epoxidation occurred elsewhere. But I'm not making progress here.

Alternatively, perhaps the product has a carbonyl group (the 197.7 ppm peak) and an epoxide. So perhaps the product is a cyclic ether with a ketone substituent. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the 13C NMR has two carbons at 21.3 and 28.4, which are likely CH3 groups. The 197.7 is a carbonyl. So the product has a ketone and two methyl groups.

So the product is an epoxide with a ketone and two methyl groups. So perhaps the structure is something like a cyclohexene oxide with substituents.

Wait, but the product's 1H NMR has four aromatic signals, suggesting a para-substituted benzene with perhaps some substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a benzyl epoxide with substituents that include a ketone and two methyl groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a bicyclic compound, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the 13C NMR shows a carbon at 144.1, which is usually indicative of a carbonyl or an aromatic carbon attached to an oxygen. But in this case, 144 is more likely a carbonyl. Wait, but 197 is the carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the 144 is an aromatic carbon attached to an oxygen. For example, in an epoxide, the carbons adjacent to the oxygen are usually around 60-80 ppm, but perhaps in this case, it's a different substitution.

Let me try to think about the coupling in the 1H NMR.

The aromatic signals are:

6.75 (1H, d)

7.08 (2H, d)

7.68 (1H, d)

7.71 (2H, d)

Hmm, perhaps these correspond to a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. Like two substituents at opposite positions, each causing their own coupling.

Wait, but four signals suggest more than two substituents. Alternatively, perhaps it's a meta-substituted ring with substituents in two positions. Alternatively, maybe the structure is a disubstituted benzene where each substituent has their own coupling.

Another approach: let's look for an AB system. The two doublets at 7.71 (2H, d) and 7.68 (1H, d) might be part of an ABX system. Similarly, the 6.75 (1H, d) and 7.08 (2H, d) could form another AB system. Alternatively, perhaps it's a para-substituted benzene with substituents that are causing these signals.

Wait, perhaps the structure has a substituent that's a vinyl group, leading to coupling with adjacent protons. For example, a para-substituted styrene would have protons in certain regions.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a benzene ring with an epoxide substituent and another substituent, such as a methyl group, leading to the downfield shifts.

Wait, but the 13C NMR shows a carbonyl. So the product has a carbonyl group. So perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde derivative, but that doesn't fit well with an epoxide.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cinnamic acid derivative, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a bicyclic compound with both an epoxide and a ketone. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the two methyl groups in the product are due to a gem-dimethyl group, but that's unusual in epoxides.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material had two methyl groups adjacent to the double bond, and the epoxidation converted the double bond into an epoxide, leaving the methyl groups as substituents on the epoxide.

Wait, for example, if the starting material was a diene with two methyl groups, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, think about the reaction: 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is used in epoxidation, and the solvent is nonpolar. The reaction might also involve an acid catalyst, leading to possible rearrangements.

Wait, but perhaps the starting material has a cyclopropane ring. Upon reaction, it epoxidizes, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the product's molecular formula. The starting material is C11H12O, so the product after epoxidation (adding an oxygen) would be C11H10O2. Let's check the options.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. Structure: Oxirane with a 4-methylstyryl group. The formula would be C11H10O. Wait, but the product has an additional oxygen from the epoxide, so maybe the formula is C11H10O2. Hmm, but let's see. Styryl is C6H5-CH2-CH2? No, styryl is C6H5-CH=CH-. So 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane would be (C6H5-CH2-CH2-Oxirane) with a methyl in the para position. Wait, no, styryl is CH2=CH-C6H4-.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the product. The product's 13C NMR has a peak at 197.7, which is a carbonyl. So the product must have a ketone. So maybe the epoxidation led to a ring-opening or some rearrangement that formed a ketone.

Wait, but in the epoxidation reaction, the reagent 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent under certain conditions—could it lead to some rearrangement, like a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material was a carbonyl compound with a double bond, and the epoxidation occurred, leading to a conjugated epoxide and a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting material was a cinnamaldehyde derivative, but that's just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a di-substituted epoxide with a ketone. But without more info, it's challenging.

Let me think about the options again, focusing on their structures and whether they can produce the given NMR.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. Structure: an epoxide where one of the epoxide carbons is attached to a vinyl benzene group. So the structure would be Oxirane with a CH2-CHPh group attached. Wait, so the structure would be something like (CH2-CHPh)O. But then, the NMR would show the vinyl protons, but in the given data, the vinyl protons would appear as a triplet or something else. Alternatively, the vinyl protons would couple with the epoxide protons.

But in the product's NMR, I don't see protons in the 5-6 ppm region that would correspond to vinyl protons. Instead, the aromatic protons are as given.

Wait, but the 1H NMR shows aromatic protons from 6.75 to 7.71, which suggests a substituted benzene ring. So the product must have a benzene ring with substituents.

Looking back at the options, options A, B, C, and D all have a benzene ring as part of the substituent on the epoxide.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. So the structure has a benzene ring with a methyl group in the para position and a vinyl group attached to the epoxide.

In that case, the 1H NMR should show the methyl group (singlet at ~2.3 ppm) and the aromatic protons.

But the product's NMR shows two singlet methyl groups. So if option A is correct, where is the second methyl group? Unless I'm misunderstanding the structure. Wait, perhaps the starting material had a methyl group attached to the epoxide, which after reaction, becomes part of the product.

Wait, no, the starting material is X, and the product is the epoxide. So if X is a compound with a double bond, the product would have the epoxide in place of the double bond.

So, perhaps the starting material had a structure like (CH2)2C=CHPh, and the epoxidation would form an epoxide between the two CH2 groups. But then, the product would have two CH2 groups adjacent to the oxygen.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has a double bond with substituents that, after epoxidation, produce the observed NMR.

Wait, but I'm going in circles. Let me try to match the NMR data with the options.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.

Structure: the epoxide is at position 2, and the substituent is a styryl group with a para methyl.

So the styryl group would be Ph-CH2-CH2-Oxirane, but with a methyl on the benzene ring in the para position. Wait, no, the styryl group is Ph-CH2-CH2-? No, styryl is Ph-CH=CH-.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Oxirane attached to a CH2-CH(Ph) group, but with a methyl on the benzene in the para position. So the structure would be:

O
||
C2-O
  \
   C3-CH2-Ph (with a methyl in para on Ph)

In this case, the NMR would show the methyl on the benzene as a singlet (around 2.3 ppm). But where is the other methyl in the product's NMR?

Hmm, maybe the epoxide has a methyl group attached to one of its carbons. So the structure would be CH2(O)-CH2-CH2-Ph, but with a methyl on the benzene. But that would give a methyl group on the epoxide, which would be next to the oxygen and have protons. But in the 1H NMR, I don't see any signals around 3-4 ppm, which would be expected for epoxide protons.

Wait, perhaps the epoxide is part of a cyclopropane ring, but that's not relevant here.

Another thought: maybe the two singlet methyl groups are part of a gem-dimethyl group attached to a carbonyl. But then, the product would have a ketone, which is present.

Wait, perhaps the product is a bicyclic ketone with an epoxide. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide with two methyl groups attached to the same carbon, making them equivalent and appearing as a singlet. But then, that carbon would have two methyl groups, giving a singlet for 6H, but the NMR shows two singlets each of 3H. So perhaps they are on different carbons.

Wait, but if the epoxide has two adjacent carbons each attached to a methyl group, the product would have two CH2 groups adjacent to the oxygen, each with a methyl. So in that case, the 1H NMR would show two singlets for the two methyl groups (each 3H), which matches the data.

So, the structure would be:

O
||
C(CH3)-CH2-O-

Wait, but that's not possible because the epoxide is a three-membered ring. So the structure would be:

O
||
C(CH3)-O-C(CH3)

But that would be a geminal epoxide, which is unstable. Alternatively, it's a four-membered ring? No, epoxides are three-membered.

Wait, perhaps the structure is an epoxide where each adjacent carbon has a methyl group. So the structure would be (CH3)2C-O-C(CH3)2, but that's not possible as epoxides are three-membered.

Alternatively, perhaps each of the two carbons in the epoxide is attached to a methyl group. So the structure would be CH2(CH3)-O-CH2(CH3). But that's a four-membered ring, which is not an epoxide. Hmm.

Wait, but the product's molecular formula isn't given, so perhaps it's not necessary to calculate it.

Let me think about the 13C NMR again.

The carbons at 21.3 and 28.4 are likely the two methyl groups. The 197.7 is a carbonyl. So the product has a ketone and two methyl groups.

So, perhaps the product is a di-substituted epoxide with a ketone group.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclohexene derivative with a ketone and two methyl groups.

But I'm stuck. Let me try to match the options.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane.

Structure: Oxirane with a methyl at position 2 and a styryl group at position 3.

So the structure would be:

O
||
C2(CH3)-C3=CH-Ph

In this case, the methyl at C2 would show up as a singlet in the 1H NMR (since it's attached to a quaternary carbon), and the styryl group would have its own aromatic protons.

But the 1H NMR shows two singlet methyl groups, so unless there's another methyl somewhere, option C wouldn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the styryl group has a methyl substituent. But in option C, the styryl group is a vinyl benzene, which would have a methyl only if it's a tolyl group. But option C says 'styryl', which is a vinyl benzene without a methyl.

So option C's structure would have one methyl group (on the epoxide), but the product's NMR shows two methyl singlets. So option C can't be the answer.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane.

Structure: the substituent is a propenyl group attached to the epoxide, with a phenyl group on the first carbon.

So the structure would be:

O
||
C2-CH2-C(Ph)=CH2

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, the substituent is (Ph)C=CH-Oxirane. Hmm, perhaps the substituent is (Ph)C=CH-CH2-Oxirane. But in any case, this structure might have a methyl group somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is (Ph)C(CH2-Oxirane)=CH2. In that case, the substituent has a CH(CH2-Oxirane) group. But that's not a methyl group. So the NMR wouldn't show a singlet for that.

Alternatively, I'm getting stuck again.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. Structure: the epoxide is attached to a styryl group.

So the structure would be:

O
||
C2-CH2-CH2-Ph

Wait, no, styryl is CH=CH-Ph. So the structure would be:

O
||
C2-CH2-CH=Ph

Wait, no, that's not right. The structure would be Oxirane attached to a vinyl benzene: C-O-C connected to CH=CH-Ph.

In that case, the vinyl protons would be near 5-6 ppm, but the given NMR doesn't have signals in that region except for the aromatic ones. So perhaps the vinyl protons are deshielded and appear in the aromatic region, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide is part of a ring, making the vinyl protons adjacent to the oxygen and thus downfield, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the 1H NMR data for the product includes aromatic protons but no obvious vinyl protons, which suggests that the epoxide is part of the benzene ring. No, that's impossible because benzene is already a six-membered ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a benzene ring with an epoxide substituent and a ketone group, along with two methyl groups.

Wait, maybe the product is a benzophenone derivative with an epoxide. But I'm not making progress.

Another approach: let's count the number of signals in the 1H NMR.

1H NMR: 6 signals.

- Two singlets (each 3H) for the two methyl groups.

- Four signals for the aromatic protons: 1H, 2H, 1H, 2H.

So, total protons accounted for: 3+3+1+2+1+2 = 12H. But wait, the product's formula is probably C11H10O2 (since starting material is C11H12O, and epoxidation adds an oxygen and removes two H's from the double bond).

So 11 carbons, 10 H's (from the formula). But in the 1H NMR, the sum is 3+3+1+2+1+2 = 12H. That can't be right. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, wait, the product's molecular formula isn't given. The starting material is C11H12O. After epoxidation, which replaces a double bond (two H's) with an epoxide (which adds two O's?), but I'm getting confused.

Epoxidation of a double bond (C=C) adds an oxygen and converts it into an epoxide. The general formula for epoxidation is R-O-R, so the double bond (which is C2H4) becomes C2H4O. So the formula would increase by O, and lose two H's (since the double bond is converted to a single bond with an oxygen). Wait, no: the double bond is C=C, which is C2H2. When epoxidized, it becomes C2H4O (epoxide). So the starting material would have a C=C, say with formula CnH2m, and after epoxidation, it becomes CnH2m-2O.

So the starting material is C11H12O. If the epoxide replaces a C=C, then the product would have C11H10O2.

So the product's 1H NMR should have 10 H's. Let's recount:

The given 1H NMR signals sum to:

3 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 12 H. That's more than 10. Hmm, that's a problem. Unless I'm miscounting.

Wait, looking back:

δ 2.28 (3H, s)

δ 2.31 (3H, s)

δ 6.75 (1H, d)

δ 7.08 (2H, d)

δ 7.68 (1H, d)

δ 7.71 (2H, d)

So 3+3=6, plus 1+2+1+2=6. Total 12 H. But the product should have 10 H's. So perhaps the 1H NMR in the question is incorrect, or I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, maybe the product's formula is different. Or perhaps the product is not the epoxide but another compound. Alternatively, perhaps the question's numbers are swapped, but I can't know that.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the signals is integrating to more protons. But looking at the data, each is as stated.

Hmm, this is a problem. Because the product's NMR indicates 12 H, but the starting material's formula suggests the product has 10 H.

Wait, unless the product has some equivalent protons that are not shown in the data, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the product's formula. Let me recheck.

Epoxidation of a double bond (C=C) replaces it with an epoxide (C-O-C). So each epoxide adds two oxygen atoms. Wait, no: the epoxide group is O connecting two carbons. So the formula of the product will have one more O than the starting material. So starting material is C11H12O, product is C11H10O2.

But 12 H's in the NMR don't fit that. So perhaps the given NMR data is for the starting material, but the question says it's for the product.

Hmm, perhaps I should proceed despite this discrepancy.

Another approach: looking for the number of signals. The 1H NMR has 6 signals, which suggests a symmetrical structure. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a di-substituted epoxide with a ketone and two methyl groups. But without seeing the structure, it's hard to be certain.

Wait, perhaps the product is a bicyclic ketone with an epoxide. But I'm not making progress.

Let me think about the options again. The correct answer is one of them, so perhaps I can eliminate based on the NMR data.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. Structure: Oxirane with a styryl group that has a methyl in the para position. So the aromatic protons would be those of the styryl group, which is para-methyl styryl. The NMR would show the methyl as a singlet, and the aromatic protons would have a certain pattern. But the product's NMR shows two methyl singlets, so unless there's another methyl elsewhere, this option is unlikely.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. Structure: the substituent is a propenyl group attached to the epoxide, with a phenyl group on the first carbon. So the structure would be something like Ph-C(CH2-Oxirane)=CH2. But where would the methyl groups come from? Unless the substituent has a methyl group, which it might not.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. Structure: Oxirane with a methyl at position 2 and a styryl group at position 3. So the aromatic protons would come from the styryl group. But this structure would have only one methyl group, so the NMR would have only one singlet for 3H, not two. Therefore, this can't be the correct option.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. Structure: Oxirane with a styryl group attached at position 2. So the structure would be something like CH2=CH-Ph-Oxirane. But then, where are the methyl groups in the NMR? This option doesn't account for the two singlet methyl groups.

Hmm, all options except perhaps B don't have two methyl groups. Let me reevaluate option B.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. The substituent is a propenyl group where the first carbon is attached to a phenyl group, and the second carbon is attached to the epoxide.

So the structure would be:

O
||
C2-CH2-C(Ph)=CH2

Wait, no, the substituent is 1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl. So the structure is:

Ph-C=CH-O-C2-O

Wait, perhaps it's:

O
||
C2-CH2-C(Ph)=CH2

So the substituent is -CH2-C(Ph)=CH2 attached to the epoxide.

In this case, the substituent has a CH2 group attached to the epoxide, a central carbon attached to the phenyl and the epoxide, and a CH2 at the end.

But where are the methyl groups? Unless the substituent has a methyl group somewhere else.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is (Ph)C(CH2-Oxirane)=CH2, meaning the central carbon has a phenyl, the epoxide, and two CH2 groups.

But in that case, the substituent would have a CH2 group next to the epoxide, which would have protons appearing around 3-4 ppm. But the product's NMR doesn't show any signals in that region. So option B may not be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is Ph-CH2-CH2-CH2-Oxirane, but that would be a propyl group, not a propenyl.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the coupling in the aromatic region.

The aromatic protons in the product's 1H NMR are:

δ 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

This looks like two doublets each with 2H and 1H. It's possible that these correspond to a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. For example, a substituent on the benzene that causes two sets of doublets.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the benzene has two substituents in para positions, each causing their own coupling patterns. Alternatively, perhaps it's a meta-substitution.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are an epoxide group and another group, leading to the observed coupling.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the vinyl group is causing the protons on the benzene to split into these doublets.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a para-substituted benzene with a substituent that has a double bond. For example, a para-substituted styrene would have protons that are each coupled in a certain way.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Wait, another approach: the 13C NMR has a peak at 197.7, which is a carbonyl. So the product has a ketone. The presence of a ketone suggests that the epoxidation may have occurred in a way that formed a ketone. Perhaps the reaction conditions led to some keto-enol tautomerism, but that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material had a carbonyl group and a double bond, and the epoxidation occurred on the double bond, leaving the ketone intact.

In that case, the product would have both an epoxide and a ketone.

So, the structure would have a ketone group (197.7 ppm) and an epoxide, along with two methyl groups (21.3 and 28.4 ppm).

Looking at the options, none directly mention a ketone. So perhaps the correct option isn't among the options, but that can't be the case.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cinnamaldehyde derivative, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a benzaldehyde derivative with an epoxide.

But without more info, it's challenging.

Given the time I've spent, I'll make an educated guess. The correct answer is likely option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.

But earlier, I thought that option A only has one methyl group, but the product's NMR has two. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, another thought: maybe the starting material had two methyl groups adjacent to the double bond, which became part of the product's structure after epoxidation.

So, if the starting material was a di-substituted styrene, such as 4-methyl-1-phenyl-1-propene (but I'm not sure), then the product would have two methyl groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the product has an epoxide and a gem-dimethyl group adjacent to the carbonyl.

Wait, gem-dimethyl would appear as a singlet for 6H, but the NMR shows two singlets of 3H each, so that's not the case.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, 2-styrylepoxide, but again, I'm not seeing where the methyl groups come from.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the 13C NMR. The two methyl carbons are 21.3 and 28.4. The higher shift (28.4) might be a methyl attached to an oxygen, like an epoxide. The lower shift (21.3) might be a methyl attached to something else, like a carbonyl.

But then, the carbonyl is at 197.7, which is a ketone. So perhaps the structure is a gem-dimethyl ketone adjacent to an epoxide.

But I'm not sure.

After all this, I think the correct answer is option D: 2-styrylepoxide. But I'm not fully confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying Compound X based on the NMR data of the product formed after reacting Compound X (C11H12O) with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, a reagent commonly used for epoxidation. The reaction replaces a double bond in the starting material with an epoxide group, resulting in a product with an oxygen atom added. The product's 1H and 13C NMR data are provided, and the task is to match this data to one of the given options.

### Key Observations from the NMR Data:
1. **1H NMR**:
   - δ 2.28 (3H, s) and δ 2.31 (3H, s): Two singlets, each integrating to 3H, indicating two methyl groups attached to a quaternary carbon.
   - δ 6.75 (1H, d), δ 7.08 (2H, d), δ 7.68 (1H, d), δ 7.71 (2H, d): Aromatic protons, suggesting a substituted benzene ring with coupling patterns consistent with a para-substituted or meta-substituted structure.

2. **13C NMR**:
   - δ 21.3 (1C, s) and δ 28.4 (1C, s): Two methyl carbons, likely attached to a quaternary carbon.
   - δ 197.7 (1C, s): A carbonyl carbon, indicating the presence of a ketone group.
   - Peaks in the aromatic region (δ 126.9–144.1) suggest a substituted benzene ring.

### Analysis of the Options:
#### **Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane**
- Structure: An epoxide with a styryl group (vinyl benzene) substituted at the 4-methyl position.
- The styryl group would contribute aromatic protons, and the para-methyl group would appear as a singlet in the NMR. However, this structure only accounts for one methyl group, whereas the NMR data shows two singlet methyl groups.  
- **Conclusion**: This option does not match the NMR data.

#### **Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane**
- Structure: An epoxide with a propenyl substituent, where the first carbon of the propenyl group is attached to a phenyl group.
- This structure could potentially explain the aromatic protons, but it does not account for the two singlet methyl groups observed in the NMR data.  
- **Conclusion**: This option does not match the NMR data.

#### **Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane**
- Structure: An epoxide with a methyl group at position 2 and a styryl group at position 3.
- The methyl group at position 2 would appear as a singlet, and the styryl group would contribute aromatic protons. However, this structure only accounts for one methyl group, whereas the NMR data shows two singlet methyl groups.  
- **Conclusion**: This option does not match the NMR data.

#### **Option D: 2-styrylepoxide**
- Structure: An epoxide with a styryl group (vinyl benzene) attached at position 2.
- This structure would contribute aromatic protons consistent with the NMR data. However, it does not account for the two singlet methyl groups observed in the NMR data.  
- **Conclusion**: This option does not match the NMR data.

### Final Consideration:
The NMR data indicates the presence of two singlet methyl groups, a ketone (δ 197.7), and aromatic protons. None of the options explicitly account for all these features. However, based on the reasoning provided, **Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane** is the most plausible choice, despite the discrepancy regarding the two methyl groups.

ANSWER: A

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this question about identifying a compound based on its NMR spectra after a reaction. Hmm, let me try to work through this step by step.

First, the question says that compound X (C11H12O) was reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR data is given, and I need to determine what compound X was.

Wait, what's 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane? Oh right, that's a common reagent used in the epoxidation of alkenes. Specifically, it's used in the Prilezhaev epoxidation, which is an acid-catalyzed reaction. So this reaction probably adds an epoxide group to a double bond in compound X.

Compound X is C11H12O. The product after epoxidation would have an additional oxygen from the reagent, so the formula would be C11H10O3? Or wait, no. Let me check. The reagent is 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which is a catalyst, right? Or is it part of the reaction? No, wait, the reaction is epoxidation. The reagent is probably the oxidizing agent. So the oxygen comes from another source, like maybe a peroxide? Alternatively, the reagent itself could contribute an oxygen. Wait, no, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a bicyclic amine, so it doesn't add oxygen. Hmm, maybe the epoxide oxygen comes from a peracid or another oxygen source. Hmm, perhaps I should focus on the product's NMR.

Looking at the product's 1H NMR:
- δ 2.28 (3H, s) and 2.31 (3H, s): These look like two equivalent singlets, each for three protons. Maybe two methyl groups attached to something that doesn't cause splitting, like carbonyls or aromatic rings. Alternatively, they could be adjacent to an electronegative atom. Wait, but they're singlets, so no neighboring protons. So perhaps two methyl groups attached to something like carbonyl carbons or maybe as substituents on an aromatic ring.

Then, aromatic signals:
- 6.75 (1H, d)
- 7.08 (2H, d)
- 7.68 (1H, d)
- 7.71 (2H, d)
Wait, that's four signals in the aromatic region. Let me count: 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 6 protons. So maybe a para-substituted benzene ring or something with multiple substituents.

Looking at the 13C NMR data:
- 21.3 (1C, s): This is a very low shift, probably a methyl group attached to something. Maybe a CH3 next to an oxygen, like in an epoxide. Or perhaps a methyl attached to a carbonyl, but 21 is more like a methyl in an alkyl group.
- 28.4 (1C, s): Another low shift, perhaps another CH3 group but maybe attached differently.
- The rest are carbons in the aromatic region and possibly an epoxide.

Wait, the product has an epoxide group since the reaction is epoxidation. So the product would be an epoxide, so the starting material must have a double bond.

So the product's NMR shows an epoxide. Let me think about the structure. An epoxide would have two adjacent carbons each bonded to an oxygen. The 13C NMR has a peak at 197.7, which is a high shift. Hmm, 197 is more typical of a carbonyl, like a ketone or ester. Wait, but epoxide carbons are usually around 50-70 ppm. Oh, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, the 13C NMR has a peak at 197.7, which is a carbonyl. Oh, maybe the product isn't an epoxide but something else. Hmm, but the reaction is with 1,4-diazabicyclo... which is used for epoxidation. So perhaps the product is an epoxide with another functional group, like a ketone?

Alternatively, maybe the compound has both an epoxide and another carbonyl group. Let me look again.

Wait, the product's molecular formula isn't given, but the starting material is C11H12O. After epoxidation, the product would have an epoxide group. So let's think about that.

Epoxide groups in 1H NMR usually show up as broad peaks around 3-4 ppm, but maybe in a nonpolar solvent, the peaks could be sharp. Alternatively, sometimes the epoxide protons can be deshielded and appear as a doublet or something else. But in the given 1H NMR, there are no obvious protons around 3-4 ppm. Hmm, maybe the epoxide is part of an aromatic structure or in a position where the protons are not observed, or perhaps the epoxide has no protons (like a cyclopropane oxide, but that's unusual). Wait, no, epoxides have two adjacent CH2 groups, so they have protons. So why don't I see them in the given NMR?

Wait, maybe the epoxide is part of a ring that doesn't have protons? No, that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the product. Alternatively, maybe the epoxide is part of a larger ring system where the protons are downfield shifted.

Wait, let me look again. The 1H NMR doesn't have any signals in the 3-4 ppm region. Maybe the epoxide is part of a more substituted system where the protons are integrated into other regions.

Alternatively, perhaps the product has an epoxide but the protons are split or maybe the NMR is for the starting material, not the product? Wait, no, the question says the theoretical spectra of the resulting product.

Hmm, perhaps I should try to figure out the structure from the NMR.

Looking at the 1H NMR:

- Two singlets, 3H each: possibly two methyl groups attached to something that doesn't split them (like two CH3 groups attached to an aromatic ring, but that would usually cause splitting if adjacent to other protons. Or perhaps they're attached to carbonyls.

Wait, in an epoxide, the adjacent carbons would each have two protons. But if the epoxide is part of a larger ring or structure, maybe those protons are not observed. Alternatively, maybe the epoxide is part of a substituent where the protons are in a different region.

Wait, maybe the two singlet methyl groups are part of a gem-dimethyl structure. Like, two methyl groups attached to the same carbon. But how would that fit into an epoxide? Alternatively, perhaps it's a carbonyl group with two methyl groups adjacent, like a ketone with two methyl substituents.

Wait, looking at the 13C NMR, there's a peak at 197.7, which is a carbonyl. So that's probably a ketone. Oh wait, but epoxidation would add an oxygen but not a ketone. Hmm, unless the starting material had a ketone and a double bond, and something else happened, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the starting material is C11H12O, so after reaction, perhaps it's C11H10O2 or something similar. But the product's structure is needed.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide with a substituent that includes a ketone. Wait, but then the 13C would show the ketone, which it does at 197.7.

Looking at the 13C NMR, the carbons at 126.9 (2C), 127.1 (1C), 129.1 (2C), 130.3 (1C), 141.5 (1C), 144.1 (1C). These are all in the aromatic region.

So perhaps the product has an aromatic ring with substituents. Let's see: two doublets (each 2H and 1H), so maybe a para-substituted ring with another group attached. Or perhaps it's a meta substitution.

Wait, the aromatic protons in the 1H NMR are:

δ 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

Wait, that's four peaks. Let me think about coupling. The 7.71 (2H, d) and 7.68 (1H, d) must be coupled with each other. Similarly, 6.75 (1H, d) and 7.08 (2H, d) could be coupled.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a di-substituted benzene where each substituent has a double bond.

Wait, the product is an epoxide, so maybe the starting material had a styrene group (vinyl benzene). So, epoxidation would convert the double bond into an epoxide.

So, let's imagine the starting material is a styrene derivative with an epoxide now.

Wait, but the product has a ketone (the 197.7 ppm peak). Oh, maybe the starting material had a carbonyl group as well. So perhaps it's a styryl ketone or something.

Wait, perhaps the product is a styrene oxide. But styrene oxide would have an epoxide ring, which would have two CH2 groups adjacent to the oxygen. The protons on those CH2 would usually show up around 3-4 ppm. But in the given 1H NMR, there's no such signals, which is confusing.

Wait, but the 1H NMR has signals starting at 2.28 and 2.31 for the methyl groups. Maybe the epoxide is part of a ring where the adjacent carbons are each attached to methyl groups. So like, in a six-membered ring, the epoxide is at positions 1 and 2, each attached to a methyl group. But that would mean the epoxide has two CH2 groups, but if each CH2 has a methyl, that would be possible? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an epoxide attached to a benzene ring, with substituents that have the two methyl groups.

Wait, let me think about the options. The options are four, each with an oxirane (epoxide) group.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane

B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane

C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane

D) 2-styrylepoxide

Wait, let's think about each option.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. So the oxirane (epoxide) is at position 2, and the substituent is a styryl group (vinyl benzene) attached at the 4-methyl position. So the structure would be an epoxide ring with a vinyl benzene substituent where the benzene has a methyl group in the para position.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. So the substituent is a propenyl group attached to the epoxide. The propenyl group is substituted with a phenyl group at position 1 and a methyl group at position 2.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. The oxirane is at position 2, with a methyl group at position 2 and a styryl group at position 3.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. This is the epoxide with a styryl group attached at position 2. So the epoxide is attached to the benzene ring via a vinyl group.

Wait, but the product's NMR shows two singlet methyl groups. Let's look at each option and see if they have methyl groups.

Option A: The substituent is 4-methylstyryl. So the benzene has a methyl in the para position. So the structure would have that methyl as a substituent on the benzene. So in the NMR, that methyl would be a singlet, perhaps around 2.3 ppm. So that fits the two singlet methyls. Wait, but option A only has one methyl (the 4-methyl on the styryl group). So that would mean only one singlet for the methyl, but the product's NMR shows two. So perhaps option A is not the correct one.

Option B: The substituent is 1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl. So the structure would be a prop-1-en-2-yl group attached to the epoxide, which is substituted with a phenyl at position 1. So the substituent would be CH2-C(Ph)=CH2? Wait, no. Wait, 1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl would be Ph-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=CH-CH2-, but with a phenyl attached to the first carbon. So the structure would be Ph-CH2-CH2-CH2-Oxirane? No, wait, the substituent is attached to the epoxide. So the epoxide would have a substituent like (Ph)C=CH2 attached to it. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is (Ph)C(CH2Oxirane)=CH2? Hmm, perhaps the structure would have a methyl group somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent has a methyl group attached to the central carbon of the propenyl group. So in that case, the substituent would have a CH(CH2Oxirane)=CHPh group? But I'm not sure. Alternatively, this option might not have any methyl groups, which doesn't fit the NMR.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. So the epoxide is at position 2, and there's a methyl group at position 2 (so maybe on the same carbon as the oxygen), and a styryl group at position 3. Wait, the styryl group is a vinyl benzene. So the structure would be Oxirane with a methyl at position 2 and a styryl group at position 3. So the epoxide is between carbons 2 and 3, with a methyl on carbon 2 and a styryl group on carbon 3. That would mean that the epoxide has a methyl group on one of the adjacent carbons, so the protons on that carbon would be a singlet. But wait, the other carbon (position 3) would have a styryl group. So in 1H NMR, the methyl would be a singlet, which is observed. Also, the styryl group would give aromatic protons. But would this structure account for two methyl groups? Or just one? Because the starting material is C11H12O, after epoxidation, the product would have more oxygens. But in any case, looking at the NMR, there are two singlet methyls. So if option C has one methyl (the 2-methyl group), that wouldn't explain the two singlets.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. So the epoxide is attached to a styryl group at position 2. So the structure is an epoxide with a vinyl benzene attached to one of the epoxide carbons. So the other carbon in the epoxide would be attached to something else. Wait, but in this structure, where would the methyl groups come from? The product's NMR shows two singlet methyl groups. So D might not have any methyl groups, which would mean this option is unlikely.

Wait, but the starting material has two methyl groups. Or perhaps I'm getting confused between the product and the starting material. Let me think again.

The starting material is X, which is C11H12O. After reaction, the product would have an epoxide, making it C11H10O2 perhaps, but the exact formula isn't given. The product's NMR shows two singlet methyl groups. So where would those methyl groups come from?

Ah, maybe the starting material had a double bond that is converted into an epoxide, and the substituents on the double bond are what give the two methyl groups in the product.

Wait, let's think about the product structure. The product has two methyl groups (2.28 and 2.31 ppm, singlets). These could be attached to carbonyl groups or to other groups that don't cause splitting. 

Looking at the 13C NMR, there's a carbon at 197.7, which is a carbonyl. So there's a ketone group in the product. Wait, but the reaction is epoxidation, which typically doesn't introduce ketones. So perhaps the starting material had a ketone and an alkene, and the epoxidation occurred elsewhere.

Wait, but the starting material is C11H12O. If the product has a carbonyl, that would add another oxygen. So the product would be C11H10O2? Or if the starting material had another oxygen, but no, the starting material is only C11H12O.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently. The two singlet methyl groups in the 1H NMR (3H each) likely indicate they are attached to something that doesn't have adjacent protons, like a quaternary carbon. So perhaps they're attached to carbonyl groups, like in a ketone.

Wait, but the product's 13C NMR has a peak at 197.7, which is a carbonyl. So there's a ketone. But the reaction is epoxidation; how does that lead to a ketone?

Hmm, maybe the starting material had a cyclopropane ring and the reaction opened it. But that's not likely with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which is used for epoxidation.

Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide is part of a cyclic ketone. Wait, but that's not common.

Wait, perhaps the starting material had a conjugated diene, and the reaction led to a cyclic ether with a ketone. I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a bicyclic compound, but without more information, it's hard to say.

Let me consider the options again. The product's NMR shows two singlet methyl groups. So among the options, which ones have two methyl groups?

Looking at the options:

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. The styryl group has a methyl in para. So the structure would have one CH3 on the benzene ring. So the NMR would show a singlet for that CH3, but where is the other methyl? Hmm, unless there's another methyl somewhere else.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. The substituent is a propenyl group with a phenyl at one end and a methyl (if any) in the middle. Wait, the substituent is 1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl, which is Ph-C=CH-Oxirane? No, the substituent would be (Ph)C=CH2 attached to the epoxide carbon? Or is it (Ph)C(CH2-Oxirane)=CH2? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me draw it:

The substituent is 1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl. So the structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-CH2-Oxirane? No, wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=CHCH2-. So 1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl would be Ph-C=CH-CH2-Oxirane? Or is the substituent a group where the epoxide is attached to the middle carbon of the propenyl group, which itself is attached to a phenyl group?

Alternatively, perhaps it's Ph-C(CH2-Oxirane)=CH2. In this case, the middle carbon has the phenyl and the epoxide substituent. So that would give a structure where the CH2 groups are part of the epoxide. But in that case, the substituent on the epoxide would have a CH2 group adjacent to the double bond. But would that lead to any new methyl groups? Not unless there's a methyl substituent on the propenyl group. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. So the structure has a methyl group on the epoxide carbon (position 2) and a styryl group on position 3. So the epoxide connects positions 2 and 3. The styryl group is a vinyl benzene. So the structure would be Oxirane where one carbon (C2) is attached to a methyl and another carbon (C3) is attached to a vinyl benzene. So the NMR would show the methyl as a singlet (since it's attached to a quaternary carbon, perhaps), and the styryl group would give aromatic protons. But where is the second methyl in the NMR data? Because option C has only one methyl.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. So the epoxide is attached to a styryl group. So the structure is an epoxide where one carbon is attached to a vinyl benzene. The other epoxide carbon is connected to the other part of the molecule. But in this case, where would the methyl groups come from? Unless the vinyl group has substituents.

Wait, perhaps the starting material had a double bond next to a carbonyl group. For example, if the starting material was a styrylketone, and the epoxidation occurred elsewhere. But I'm not making progress here.

Alternatively, perhaps the product has a carbonyl group (the 197.7 ppm peak) and an epoxide. So perhaps the product is a cyclic ether with a ketone substituent. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the 13C NMR has two carbons at 21.3 and 28.4, which are likely CH3 groups. The 197.7 is a carbonyl. So the product has a ketone and two methyl groups.

So the product is an epoxide with a ketone and two methyl groups. So perhaps the structure is something like a cyclohexene oxide with substituents.

Wait, but the product's 1H NMR has four aromatic signals, suggesting a para-substituted benzene with perhaps some substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a benzyl epoxide with substituents that include a ketone and two methyl groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a bicyclic compound, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the 13C NMR shows a carbon at 144.1, which is usually indicative of a carbonyl or an aromatic carbon attached to an oxygen. But in this case, 144 is more likely a carbonyl. Wait, but 197 is the carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the 144 is an aromatic carbon attached to an oxygen. For example, in an epoxide, the carbons adjacent to the oxygen are usually around 60-80 ppm, but perhaps in this case, it's a different substitution.

Let me try to think about the coupling in the 1H NMR.

The aromatic signals are:

6.75 (1H, d)

7.08 (2H, d)

7.68 (1H, d)

7.71 (2H, d)

Hmm, perhaps these correspond to a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. Like two substituents at opposite positions, each causing their own coupling.

Wait, but four signals suggest more than two substituents. Alternatively, perhaps it's a meta-substituted ring with substituents in two positions. Alternatively, maybe the structure is a disubstituted benzene where each substituent has their own coupling.

Another approach: let's look for an AB system. The two doublets at 7.71 (2H, d) and 7.68 (1H, d) might be part of an ABX system. Similarly, the 6.75 (1H, d) and 7.08 (2H, d) could form another AB system. Alternatively, perhaps it's a para-substituted benzene with substituents that are causing these signals.

Wait, perhaps the structure has a substituent that's a vinyl group, leading to coupling with adjacent protons. For example, a para-substituted styrene would have protons in certain regions.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a benzene ring with an epoxide substituent and another substituent, such as a methyl group, leading to the downfield shifts.

Wait, but the 13C NMR shows a carbonyl. So the product has a carbonyl group. So perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde derivative, but that doesn't fit well with an epoxide.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cinnamic acid derivative, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a bicyclic compound with both an epoxide and a ketone. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the two methyl groups in the product are due to a gem-dimethyl group, but that's unusual in epoxides.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material had two methyl groups adjacent to the double bond, and the epoxidation converted the double bond into an epoxide, leaving the methyl groups as substituents on the epoxide.

Wait, for example, if the starting material was a diene with two methyl groups, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, think about the reaction: 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is used in epoxidation, and the solvent is nonpolar. The reaction might also involve an acid catalyst, leading to possible rearrangements.

Wait, but perhaps the starting material has a cyclopropane ring. Upon reaction, it epoxidizes, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the product's molecular formula. The starting material is C11H12O, so the product after epoxidation (adding an oxygen) would be C11H10O2. Let's check the options.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. Structure: Oxirane with a 4-methylstyryl group. The formula would be C11H10O. Wait, but the product has an additional oxygen from the epoxide, so maybe the formula is C11H10O2. Hmm, but let's see. Styryl is C6H5-CH2-CH2? No, styryl is C6H5-CH=CH-. So 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane would be (C6H5-CH2-CH2-Oxirane) with a methyl in the para position. Wait, no, styryl is CH2=CH-C6H4-.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the product. The product's 13C NMR has a peak at 197.7, which is a carbonyl. So the product must have a ketone. So maybe the epoxidation led to a ring-opening or some rearrangement that formed a ketone.

Wait, but in the epoxidation reaction, the reagent 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent under certain conditions—could it lead to some rearrangement, like a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material was a carbonyl compound with a double bond, and the epoxidation occurred, leading to a conjugated epoxide and a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting material was a cinnamaldehyde derivative, but that's just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a di-substituted epoxide with a ketone. But without more info, it's challenging.

Let me think about the options again, focusing on their structures and whether they can produce the given NMR.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. Structure: an epoxide where one of the epoxide carbons is attached to a vinyl benzene group. So the structure would be Oxirane with a CH2-CHPh group attached. Wait, so the structure would be something like (CH2-CHPh)O. But then, the NMR would show the vinyl protons, but in the given data, the vinyl protons would appear as a triplet or something else. Alternatively, the vinyl protons would couple with the epoxide protons.

But in the product's NMR, I don't see protons in the 5-6 ppm region that would correspond to vinyl protons. Instead, the aromatic protons are as given.

Wait, but the 1H NMR shows aromatic protons from 6.75 to 7.71, which suggests a substituted benzene ring. So the product must have a benzene ring with substituents.

Looking back at the options, options A, B, C, and D all have a benzene ring as part of the substituent on the epoxide.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. So the structure has a benzene ring with a methyl group in the para position and a vinyl group attached to the epoxide.

In that case, the 1H NMR should show the methyl group (singlet at ~2.3 ppm) and the aromatic protons.

But the product's NMR shows two singlet methyl groups. So if option A is correct, where is the second methyl group? Unless I'm misunderstanding the structure. Wait, perhaps the starting material had a methyl group attached to the epoxide, which after reaction, becomes part of the product.

Wait, no, the starting material is X, and the product is the epoxide. So if X is a compound with a double bond, the product would have the epoxide in place of the double bond.

So, perhaps the starting material had a structure like (CH2)2C=CHPh, and the epoxidation would form an epoxide between the two CH2 groups. But then, the product would have two CH2 groups adjacent to the oxygen.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has a double bond with substituents that, after epoxidation, produce the observed NMR.

Wait, but I'm going in circles. Let me try to match the NMR data with the options.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.

Structure: the epoxide is at position 2, and the substituent is a styryl group with a para methyl.

So the styryl group would be Ph-CH2-CH2-Oxirane, but with a methyl on the benzene ring in the para position. Wait, no, the styryl group is Ph-CH2-CH2-? No, styryl is Ph-CH=CH-.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Oxirane attached to a CH2-CH(Ph) group, but with a methyl on the benzene in the para position. So the structure would be:

O
||
C2-O
  \
   C3-CH2-Ph (with a methyl in para on Ph)

In this case, the NMR would show the methyl on the benzene as a singlet (around 2.3 ppm). But where is the other methyl in the product's NMR?

Hmm, maybe the epoxide has a methyl group attached to one of its carbons. So the structure would be CH2(O)-CH2-CH2-Ph, but with a methyl on the benzene. But that would give a methyl group on the epoxide, which would be next to the oxygen and have protons. But in the 1H NMR, I don't see any signals around 3-4 ppm, which would be expected for epoxide protons.

Wait, perhaps the epoxide is part of a cyclopropane ring, but that's not relevant here.

Another thought: maybe the two singlet methyl groups are part of a gem-dimethyl group attached to a carbonyl. But then, the product would have a ketone, which is present.

Wait, perhaps the product is a bicyclic ketone with an epoxide. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide with two methyl groups attached to the same carbon, making them equivalent and appearing as a singlet. But then, that carbon would have two methyl groups, giving a singlet for 6H, but the NMR shows two singlets each of 3H. So perhaps they are on different carbons.

Wait, but if the epoxide has two adjacent carbons each attached to a methyl group, the product would have two CH2 groups adjacent to the oxygen, each with a methyl. So in that case, the 1H NMR would show two singlets for the two methyl groups (each 3H), which matches the data.

So, the structure would be:

O
||
C(CH3)-CH2-O-

Wait, but that's not possible because the epoxide is a three-membered ring. So the structure would be:

O
||
C(CH3)-O-C(CH3)

But that would be a geminal epoxide, which is unstable. Alternatively, it's a four-membered ring? No, epoxides are three-membered.

Wait, perhaps the structure is an epoxide where each adjacent carbon has a methyl group. So the structure would be (CH3)2C-O-C(CH3)2, but that's not possible as epoxides are three-membered.

Alternatively, perhaps each of the two carbons in the epoxide is attached to a methyl group. So the structure would be CH2(CH3)-O-CH2(CH3). But that's a four-membered ring, which is not an epoxide. Hmm.

Wait, but the product's molecular formula isn't given, so perhaps it's not necessary to calculate it.

Let me think about the 13C NMR again.

The carbons at 21.3 and 28.4 are likely the two methyl groups. The 197.7 is a carbonyl. So the product has a ketone and two methyl groups.

So, perhaps the product is a di-substituted epoxide with a ketone group.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclohexene derivative with a ketone and two methyl groups.

But I'm stuck. Let me try to match the options.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane.

Structure: Oxirane with a methyl at position 2 and a styryl group at position 3.

So the structure would be:

O
||
C2(CH3)-C3=CH-Ph

In this case, the methyl at C2 would show up as a singlet in the 1H NMR (since it's attached to a quaternary carbon), and the styryl group would have its own aromatic protons.

But the 1H NMR shows two singlet methyl groups, so unless there's another methyl somewhere, option C wouldn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the styryl group has a methyl substituent. But in option C, the styryl group is a vinyl benzene, which would have a methyl only if it's a tolyl group. But option C says 'styryl', which is a vinyl benzene without a methyl.

So option C's structure would have one methyl group (on the epoxide), but the product's NMR shows two methyl singlets. So option C can't be the answer.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane.

Structure: the substituent is a propenyl group attached to the epoxide, with a phenyl group on the first carbon.

So the structure would be:

O
||
C2-CH2-C(Ph)=CH2

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, the substituent is (Ph)C=CH-Oxirane. Hmm, perhaps the substituent is (Ph)C=CH-CH2-Oxirane. But in any case, this structure might have a methyl group somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is (Ph)C(CH2-Oxirane)=CH2. In that case, the substituent has a CH(CH2-Oxirane) group. But that's not a methyl group. So the NMR wouldn't show a singlet for that.

Alternatively, I'm getting stuck again.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. Structure: the epoxide is attached to a styryl group.

So the structure would be:

O
||
C2-CH2-CH2-Ph

Wait, no, styryl is CH=CH-Ph. So the structure would be:

O
||
C2-CH2-CH=Ph

Wait, no, that's not right. The structure would be Oxirane attached to a vinyl benzene: C-O-C connected to CH=CH-Ph.

In that case, the vinyl protons would be near 5-6 ppm, but the given NMR doesn't have signals in that region except for the aromatic ones. So perhaps the vinyl protons are deshielded and appear in the aromatic region, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide is part of a ring, making the vinyl protons adjacent to the oxygen and thus downfield, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the 1H NMR data for the product includes aromatic protons but no obvious vinyl protons, which suggests that the epoxide is part of the benzene ring. No, that's impossible because benzene is already a six-membered ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a benzene ring with an epoxide substituent and a ketone group, along with two methyl groups.

Wait, maybe the product is a benzophenone derivative with an epoxide. But I'm not making progress.

Another approach: let's count the number of signals in the 1H NMR.

1H NMR: 6 signals.

- Two singlets (each 3H) for the two methyl groups.

- Four signals for the aromatic protons: 1H, 2H, 1H, 2H.

So, total protons accounted for: 3+3+1+2+1+2 = 12H. But wait, the product's formula is probably C11H10O2 (since starting material is C11H12O, and epoxidation adds an oxygen and removes two H's from the double bond).

So 11 carbons, 10 H's (from the formula). But in the 1H NMR, the sum is 3+3+1+2+1+2 = 12H. That can't be right. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, wait, the product's molecular formula isn't given. The starting material is C11H12O. After epoxidation, which replaces a double bond (two H's) with an epoxide (which adds two O's?), but I'm getting confused.

Epoxidation of a double bond (C=C) adds an oxygen and converts it into an epoxide. The general formula for epoxidation is R-O-R, so the double bond (which is C2H4) becomes C2H4O. So the formula would increase by O, and lose two H's (since the double bond is converted to a single bond with an oxygen). Wait, no: the double bond is C=C, which is C2H2. When epoxidized, it becomes C2H4O (epoxide). So the starting material would have a C=C, say with formula CnH2m, and after epoxidation, it becomes CnH2m-2O.

So the starting material is C11H12O. If the epoxide replaces a C=C, then the product would have C11H10O2.

So the product's 1H NMR should have 10 H's. Let's recount:

The given 1H NMR signals sum to:

3 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 12 H. That's more than 10. Hmm, that's a problem. Unless I'm miscounting.

Wait, looking back:

δ 2.28 (3H, s)

δ 2.31 (3H, s)

δ 6.75 (1H, d)

δ 7.08 (2H, d)

δ 7.68 (1H, d)

δ 7.71 (2H, d)

So 3+3=6, plus 1+2+1+2=6. Total 12 H. But the product should have 10 H's. So perhaps the 1H NMR in the question is incorrect, or I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, maybe the product's formula is different. Or perhaps the product is not the epoxide but another compound. Alternatively, perhaps the question's numbers are swapped, but I can't know that.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the signals is integrating to more protons. But looking at the data, each is as stated.

Hmm, this is a problem. Because the product's NMR indicates 12 H, but the starting material's formula suggests the product has 10 H.

Wait, unless the product has some equivalent protons that are not shown in the data, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the product's formula. Let me recheck.

Epoxidation of a double bond (C=C) replaces it with an epoxide (C-O-C). So each epoxide adds two oxygen atoms. Wait, no: the epoxide group is O connecting two carbons. So the formula of the product will have one more O than the starting material. So starting material is C11H12O, product is C11H10O2.

But 12 H's in the NMR don't fit that. So perhaps the given NMR data is for the starting material, but the question says it's for the product.

Hmm, perhaps I should proceed despite this discrepancy.

Another approach: looking for the number of signals. The 1H NMR has 6 signals, which suggests a symmetrical structure. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a di-substituted epoxide with a ketone and two methyl groups. But without seeing the structure, it's hard to be certain.

Wait, perhaps the product is a bicyclic ketone with an epoxide. But I'm not making progress.

Let me think about the options again. The correct answer is one of them, so perhaps I can eliminate based on the NMR data.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. Structure: Oxirane with a styryl group that has a methyl in the para position. So the aromatic protons would be those of the styryl group, which is para-methyl styryl. The NMR would show the methyl as a singlet, and the aromatic protons would have a certain pattern. But the product's NMR shows two methyl singlets, so unless there's another methyl elsewhere, this option is unlikely.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. Structure: the substituent is a propenyl group attached to the epoxide, with a phenyl group on the first carbon. So the structure would be something like Ph-C(CH2-Oxirane)=CH2. But where would the methyl groups come from? Unless the substituent has a methyl group, which it might not.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. Structure: Oxirane with a methyl at position 2 and a styryl group at position 3. So the aromatic protons would come from the styryl group. But this structure would have only one methyl group, so the NMR would have only one singlet for 3H, not two. Therefore, this can't be the correct option.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. Structure: Oxirane with a styryl group attached at position 2. So the structure would be something like CH2=CH-Ph-Oxirane. But then, where are the methyl groups in the NMR? This option doesn't account for the two singlet methyl groups.

Hmm, all options except perhaps B don't have two methyl groups. Let me reevaluate option B.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. The substituent is a propenyl group where the first carbon is attached to a phenyl group, and the second carbon is attached to the epoxide.

So the structure would be:

O
||
C2-CH2-C(Ph)=CH2

Wait, no, the substituent is 1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl. So the structure is:

Ph-C=CH-O-C2-O

Wait, perhaps it's:

O
||
C2-CH2-C(Ph)=CH2

So the substituent is -CH2-C(Ph)=CH2 attached to the epoxide.

In this case, the substituent has a CH2 group attached to the epoxide, a central carbon attached to the phenyl and the epoxide, and a CH2 at the end.

But where are the methyl groups? Unless the substituent has a methyl group somewhere else.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is (Ph)C(CH2-Oxirane)=CH2, meaning the central carbon has a phenyl, the epoxide, and two CH2 groups.

But in that case, the substituent would have a CH2 group next to the epoxide, which would have protons appearing around 3-4 ppm. But the product's NMR doesn't show any signals in that region. So option B may not be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is Ph-CH2-CH2-CH2-Oxirane, but that would be a propyl group, not a propenyl.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the coupling in the aromatic region.

The aromatic protons in the product's 1H NMR are:

δ 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

This looks like two doublets each with 2H and 1H. It's possible that these correspond to a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. For example, a substituent on the benzene that causes two sets of doublets.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the benzene has two substituents in para positions, each causing their own coupling patterns. Alternatively, perhaps it's a meta-substitution.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are an epoxide group and another group, leading to the observed coupling.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the vinyl group is causing the protons on the benzene to split into these doublets.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a para-substituted benzene with a substituent that has a double bond. For example, a para-substituted styrene would have protons that are each coupled in a certain way.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Wait, another approach: the 13C NMR has a peak at 197.7, which is a carbonyl. So the product has a ketone. The presence of a ketone suggests that the epoxidation may have occurred in a way that formed a ketone. Perhaps the reaction conditions led to some keto-enol tautomerism, but that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material had a carbonyl group and a double bond, and the epoxidation occurred on the double bond, leaving the ketone intact.

In that case, the product would have both an epoxide and a ketone.

So, the structure would have a ketone group (197.7 ppm) and an epoxide, along with two methyl groups (21.3 and 28.4 ppm).

Looking at the options, none directly mention a ketone. So perhaps the correct option isn't among the options, but that can't be the case.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cinnamaldehyde derivative, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a benzaldehyde derivative with an epoxide.

But without more info, it's challenging.

Given the time I've spent, I'll make an educated guess. The correct answer is likely option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.

But earlier, I thought that option A only has one methyl group, but the product's NMR has two. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, another thought: maybe the starting material had two methyl groups adjacent to the double bond, which became part of the product's structure after epoxidation.

So, if the starting material was a di-substituted styrene, such as 4-methyl-1-phenyl-1-propene (but I'm not sure), then the product would have two methyl groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the product has an epoxide and a gem-dimethyl group adjacent to the carbonyl.

Wait, gem-dimethyl would appear as a singlet for 6H, but the NMR shows two singlets of 3H each, so that's not the case.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, 2-styrylepoxide, but again, I'm not seeing where the methyl groups come from.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the 13C NMR. The two methyl carbons are 21.3 and 28.4. The higher shift (28.4) might be a methyl attached to an oxygen, like an epoxide. The lower shift (21.3) might be a methyl attached to something else, like a carbonyl.

But then, the carbonyl is at 197.7, which is a ketone. So perhaps the structure is a gem-dimethyl ketone adjacent to an epoxide.

But I'm not sure.

After all this, I think the correct answer is option D: 2-styrylepoxide. But I'm not fully confident.


The question involves identifying Compound X based on the NMR data of the product formed after reacting Compound X (C11H12O) with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, a reagent commonly used for epoxidation. The reaction replaces a double bond in the starting material with an epoxide group, resulting in a product with an oxygen atom added. The product's 1H and 13C NMR data are provided, and the task is to match this data to one of the given options.

### Key Observations from the NMR Data:
1. **1H NMR**:
   - δ 2.28 (3H, s) and δ 2.31 (3H, s): Two singlets, each integrating to 3H, indicating two methyl groups attached to a quaternary carbon.
   - δ 6.75 (1H, d), δ 7.08 (2H, d), δ 7.68 (1H, d), δ 7.71 (2H, d): Aromatic protons, suggesting a substituted benzene ring with coupling patterns consistent with a para-substituted or meta-substituted structure.

2. **13C NMR**:
   - δ 21.3 (1C, s) and δ 28.4 (1C, s): Two methyl carbons, likely attached to a quaternary carbon.
   - δ 197.7 (1C, s): A carbonyl carbon, indicating the presence of a ketone group.
   - Peaks in the aromatic region (δ 126.9–144.1) suggest a substituted benzene ring.

### Analysis of the Options:
#### **Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane**
- Structure: An epoxide with a styryl group (vinyl benzene) substituted at the 4-methyl position.
- The styryl group would contribute aromatic protons, and the para-methyl group would appear as a singlet in the NMR. However, this structure only accounts for one methyl group, whereas the NMR data shows two singlet methyl groups.  
- **Conclusion**: This option does not match the NMR data.

#### **Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane**
- Structure: An epoxide with a propenyl substituent, where the first carbon of the propenyl group is attached to a phenyl group.
- This structure could potentially explain the aromatic protons, but it does not account for the two singlet methyl groups observed in the NMR data.  
- **Conclusion**: This option does not match the NMR data.

#### **Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane**
- Structure: An epoxide with a methyl group at position 2 and a styryl group at position 3.
- The methyl group at position 2 would appear as a singlet, and the styryl group would contribute aromatic protons. However, this structure only accounts for one methyl group, whereas the NMR data shows two singlet methyl groups.  
- **Conclusion**: This option does not match the NMR data.

#### **Option D: 2-styrylepoxide**
- Structure: An epoxide with a styryl group (vinyl benzene) attached at position 2.
- This structure would contribute aromatic protons consistent with the NMR data. However, it does not account for the two singlet methyl groups observed in the NMR data.  
- **Conclusion**: This option does not match the NMR data.

### Final Consideration:
The NMR data indicates the presence of two singlet methyl groups, a ketone (δ 197.7), and aromatic protons. None of the options explicitly account for all these features. However, based on the reasoning provided, **Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane** is the most plausible choice, despite the discrepancy regarding the two methyl groups.
