Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in product 4 of this reaction sequence. Let me take it step by step because I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

Alright, the starting material is cyclohexanone. I know that cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring with a ketone group (a carbonyl). So, the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a (C=O) group attached.

First step: cyclohexanone is treated with bromine to form product 1. Hmm, when ketones react with bromine, I'm thinking maybe it's a halogenation. Wait, no, wait. Oh, wait, bromine can add to alkenes, but cyclohexanone doesn't have a double bond. Oh wait, maybe it's a ring-opening or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a haloform reaction? No, the haloform reaction usually happens with methyl ketones. Cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, not a methyl ketone. So that might not apply here.

Wait another thought: Maybe it's a benzylic bromination. Oh, wait, cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group, which is adjacent to a CH2 group (the carbonyl is attached to a CH2, right? Because the structure is cyclohexane with a carbonyl. So maybe the alpha position is the CH2 next to the carbonyl.

Wait, benzylic bromination would require a benzene ring attached, but cyclohexanone isn't benzene. Oh, but wait, isn't the cyclohexanone a six-membered ring with a ketone? So the carbonyl is part of the ring. No, wait, no, cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group as a substituent. The structure is a cyclohexane ring with a (C=O) group attached. So the adjacent carbons are the ones attached to the ketone. So the alpha carbons are the two CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyl.

Wait, so when cyclohexanone is treated with bromine, maybe it undergoes some kind of addition or substitution. Alternatively, perhaps it's a bromohydrination? But I think that's when water is present. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a keto-enol tautomerism situation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Bromine (Br2) in certain conditions can lead to the formation of dibromides. In the presence of a ketone, perhaps it's a conjugate addition or some kind of dihalide formation.

Wait, another thought: Maybe it's a bromination via an enolate. Oh, right! If a ketone is treated with a strong base, it can form an enolate, which then reacts with an electrophile like bromine. But wait, in this case, the reagent is bromine, not a base. So maybe the conditions aren't basic. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a dihalogenation via the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that's with an oxidizing agent and gives a ketone oxide, which isn't relevant here.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. Product 1 is formed by treating cyclohexanone with bromine. Another possibility: cyclohexanone can undergo a bromination at the alpha position because the alpha carbons are more reactive due to the carbonyl group. So, perhaps the alpha position undergoes bromination.

Wait, but how does that happen? Oh, maybe it's a radical bromination, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the bromine could add across the carbonyl group, but that doesn't make much sense because ketones typically don't open up with bromine without some catalyst.

Wait, maybe the bromine is adding via an enol intermediate. So cyclohexanone would form an enol, which then reacts with bromine. But without a base, would that happen? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a bromination at the alpha position via a mechanism where the carbonyl group activates the adjacent C-H bonds, making them susceptible to bromine. So, maybe a single bromine is added at one of the alpha positions.

Wait, but cyclohexanone has two equivalent alpha positions (the two CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyl). So if bromine adds once, it would add to one of them, but they're equivalent, so product 1 would be 1-bromo-cyclohexanone. But wait, if that's the case, the bromine would be on a CH2 group. But wait, no, the alpha carbons in cyclohexanone are each CH2 groups attached to the carbonyl.

Wait, so if the reaction adds a bromine to one of the alpha carbons, then product 1 would be 1-bromo-cyclohexanone. But the positions are symmetrical, so the bromine could be on either side.

Wait, but wait another thing: The reaction of ketones with bromine can lead to the formation of a 1,2-dibromide. Is that possible? Like, the bromine adds across the carbonyl? No, because the carbonyl is a C=O, not a double bond between two carbons. Adding bromine across a carbonyl would require some acidic conditions or something. Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexanone undergoes some kind of ring-opening in the presence of bromine. I'm not too sure.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of another approach. Perhaps the first step is a diaddition, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's a bromide substitution on the carbonyl oxygen? No, the carbonyl oxygen is not a good leaving group. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the next steps. Maybe product 1 is something that when heated with NaOH forms product 2, which is then treated with SOCl2 and pyridine to form product 3, and then treated with LiAlH(t-Bu)3 to form product 4.

Wait, let's see the sequence:

1. Cyclohexanone + Br2 → product 1
2. Product 1 + NaOH, heat → product 2
3. Product 2 + SOCl2, pyridine → product 3
4. Product 3 + LiAlH(t-Bu)3 → product 4

So, perhaps each step is a known reaction. Maybe I can think about each step.

First step: cyclohexanone + Br2 → perhaps a di-substitution? Or maybe a vicinal dihalide? Or maybe a bromide at the alpha position.

Wait, another idea: maybe the bromine is adding to the carbonyl group, but that would form a bromide in the alpha position. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dibromide via some kind of addition.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution. Wait, but cyclohexanone doesn't have a good leaving group. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's the formation of a benzilic acid bromide, but that's when the alpha carbon is converted into a bromide by cleavage. But that's more in haloform reaction, which requires a methyl ketone. Oh, but cyclohexanone isn't a methyl ketone. So perhaps that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine is adding to the cyclohexanone in some way, but I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps it's a bromohydrin formation. So, when a ketone reacts with bromine and water, it forms a bromohydrin. But in this step, the reagent is just bromine. So maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening. Wait, cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring. If bromine adds across the carbonyl, but I don't think that's possible. Alternatively, perhaps the ring isn't opening, but the bromine is adding to the ring.

Wait, perhaps it's a bromine addition across the carbonyl, but that doesn't make sense because adding Br2 to a carbonyl would require some sort of conjugation or an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, which cyclohexanone isn't.

Hmm, maybe I'm stuck on the first step. Let's think about the second step. Product 1 is treated with NaOH and heat to form product 2. So, perhaps product 1 is a dibromide or a bromide that, upon treatment with base, undergoes elimination or substitution.

Wait, for example, if product 1 is a vicinal dibromide, then treatment with NaOH and heat would lead to an elimination reaction, forming an alkene. So, product 2 would be an alkene.

Alternatively, if product 1 is a mono-bromide, then treatment with NaOH could lead to substitution, but in a ketone, the leaving group would have to be on an adjacent position.

Wait, perhaps the first reaction is a di-substitution, adding two bromines to adjacent positions. Let me imagine the cyclohexanone ring. If the carbonyl is at position 1, then adding two Br atoms to positions 2 and 3, making a 2,3-dibromocyclohexanone. Then, when treated with NaOH and heat, it could eliminate to form a double bond between C2 and C3. So product 2 would be cyclohexenone (cyclohex-2-enone, perhaps).

Alternatively, product 1 could be a bromide on the alpha carbon, and upon treatment with NaOH, it would eliminate the OH group (if any) to form an alkene.

Wait, but if product 1 is a bromide on the alpha carbon, then in the second step, perhaps it's a dehydration. So, product 2 is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone.

Wait, that makes sense. So, the first step is bromination of the alpha position, giving 1-bromo-cyclohexanone.

Then, in the second step, treatment with NaOH and heat would cause elimination, removing H and Br to form a double bond. So product 2 would be cyclohex-1-enone (or perhaps cyclohex-2-enone, depending on where the Br was).

Wait, but cyclohexanone has the carbonyl at position 1, so the adjacent alpha carbons are 2 and 6. So if the bromine is added to position 2, then elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2, making cyclohex-1-enone. But wait, that's not possible because the carbonyl is at C1, and the double bond would be between C1 and C2, making it a conjugated enone, which is possible.

Wait, but when you eliminate H and Br from adjacent positions, the double bond forms between those positions. So if the Br is on C2, then elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2, resulting in cyclohex-1-enone.

So product 2 is cyclohexenone, which is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone.

Then, the third step is treating product 2 with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine to form product 3.

Thionyl chloride typically converts ketones or aldehydes into chlorides. Wait, but product 2 is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. So, perhaps the carbonyl group is converted into an acyl chloride. So, product 3 would be the acyl chloride version of product 2, i.e., cyclohexenyl chloride or something like that.

Wait, the structure would be the enone (double bond between C1 and C2, carbonyl at C1) converted into a chlorinated carbonyl. Wait, no, more accurately, the ketone (O) becomes OCl, but more accurately, the oxygen is replaced with Cl. So, the ketone (O=C-) becomes Cl-C-Cl, but wait, no, the carbonyl group becomes Cl.

Wait, no, when a ketone reacts with SOCl2, it's converted into an acyl chloride. So, for example, cyclohexanone would become cyclohexanoyl chloride. So product 2 is cyclohexenone, which is (Z)- or (E)-cyclohexen-1-one. Then, treating that with SOCl2 would convert the ketone into an acyl chloride. So product 3 is cyclohexenoyl chloride.

Wait, but the position of the double bond is important here. So, if product 2 is cyclohex-1-en-2-one, then product 3 would be cyclohex-1-en-2-yl chloride, but I'm not exactly sure about the nomenclature here.

Wait, but let me think more about the structure. Product 2 is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, so it's something like cyclohexenone. Then, product 3 is the corresponding acyl chloride, so it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated acyl chloride.

Now, the fourth step is treating product 3 with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(t-Bu)3), which is a strong reducing agent. Wait, but wait, acyl chlorides are typically reduced to alcohols using LiAlH4. But this is a modified version, LiAlH(t-Bu)3, which I think is a bulky reducing agent, perhaps used for stereoselective reductions, like in the Birch reduction or in reducing esters or amides.

Wait, in any case, when an acyl chloride is treated with a strong reducing agent like LiAlH4, it's usually reduced to the corresponding alcohol. So, product 4 would be the alcohol derived from the acyl chloride.

Wait, but let's go through the steps again.

Product 3 is an acyl chloride. So, when you reduce an acyl chloride with a hydride, you end up with a primary alcohol. But wait, in this case, the carbonyl is part of an alpha,beta-unsaturated system. So, the acyl chloride is an alpha,beta-unsaturated acyl chloride, meaning that the carbonyl is conjugated with a double bond.

So, when you reduce an alpha,beta-unsaturated acyl chloride, maybe the reduction could be more complex. I think that in such cases, the reduction could lead to the conjugate addition of the hydride, or maybe just the direct reduction of the carbonyl.

Wait, no, LiAlH(t-Bu)3 is a strong enough reducing agent that it can reduce the acyl chloride. The reaction would typically give the corresponding alcohol. So, the structure would have the double bond still intact, and the carbonyl (O) would be replaced by an OH group.

Wait, so product 4 would be an alpha,beta-unsaturated alcohol. So, the structure would have a double bond and an OH group in conjugation.

Wait, but let's imagine the structure. So, product 2 is cyclohex-1-en-2-one. So, the ring has a double bond between C1 and C2, and the carbonyl is at C2. So, product 3 would be cyclohex-1-en-2-yl chloride. Then, reducing that would convert the carbonyl (O) into an OH. But wait, in the acyl chloride, the carbonyl is Cl, so upon reduction, it becomes an -OH group.

Wait, but if the structure is cyclohex-1-en-2-yl chloride, then after reduction, it becomes cyclohex-1-en-2-ol. So, a cyclohexene ring with an OH group on C2 and a double bond between C1 and C2.

Wait, but wait, let's think about the actual structure. Let me draw it out in my mind. The cyclohexane ring has five single bonds and one double bond. So, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The OH is on C2, and C2 is also connected to the rest of the ring.

Wait, but in such a structure, how many equivalent hydrogens are there?

Hmm, let's think about the symmetry. The molecule would have a double bond between C1 and C2, and an OH group on C2. The ring is a six-membered ring. So, the substituents are on C1 (part of the double bond) and C2 (OH group).

So, the molecule is cyclohex-1-en-2-ol. Now, the question is about the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4.

So, let me imagine the structure of cyclohex-1-en-2-ol. The ring has a double bond between C1 and C2, and an OH group on C2.

Wait, but wait, cyclohex-1-en-2-ol would have the structure where the double bond is between C1 and C2 (so, positions 1 and 2 are double-bonded), and the OH is on C2. So, the substituents are on adjacent carbons.

Wait, but in cyclohexene, the positions are numbered such that the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the ring is numbered in a way that gives the lowest possible numbers.

So, in this molecule, after the reduction, the structure is cyclohex-1-en-2-ol.

Now, let's determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.

I need to look for symmetry in the molecule. Because the molecule has a double bond and an OH group, the symmetry is limited.

Let's number the carbons in the ring as follows:

Carbon 1: double bond to C2.

Carbon 2: attached to OH and connected to C1 (double bond) and C3.

Carbon 3: connected to C2 and C4.

Carbon 4: connected to C3 and C5.

Carbon 5: connected to C4 and C6.

Carbon 6: connected to C5 and C1.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, in cyclohexene with a double bond between C1 and C2, the ring is arranged such that C1 is connected to C2 via double bond, C2 is connected to C3, and so on, up to C6 connected back to C1.

Wait, no, that's not possible because in a six-membered ring, a double bond between C1 and C2 would mean that C2 is connected to C1 (double) and C3 (single), and C3 is connected to C4, etc., up to C6 connected to C1.

Wait, but in a cyclohexene ring, the numbering would be such that the double bond is between adjacent carbons. So, the molecule would look like:

C1 double bonded to C2, C2 single bonded to C3, C3 single bonded to C4, C4 single bonded to C5, C5 single bonded to C6, and C6 single bonded to C1. Wait, that can't be right because that would make a ring with five single bonds and one double, but that's impossible in a six-membered ring. Oh, wait no, in a six-membered ring, each carbon is bonded to two others, so a double bond between C1 and C2 would mean that C1 is bonded to C2 (double) and C6 (single), and C2 is bonded to C1 (double), C3 (single), and maybe other substituents.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the numbering. Let me think of the structure as a cyclohexene ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, and an OH group on C2.

So, the molecule would have the following arrangement:

- C1 is double-bonded to C2.
- C2 has an OH group, is double bonded to C1, and single bonded to C3.
- C3 is single bonded to C2 and C4.
- C4 is single bonded to C3 and C5.
- C5 is single bonded to C4 and C6.
- C6 is single bonded to C5 and C1.

Wait, but that makes a ring of six carbons with a double bond between C1 and C2, and an OH on C2.

Now, let's consider the symmetry. The molecule is not symmetrical because of the double bond and the OH group. So, each position may have a unique hydrogen environment.

But let me think: Are any of the hydrogens equivalent?

Let's list the hydrogens on each carbon:

- C1: attached to C2 (double bond) and C6. The hydrogens on C1 would be equivalent if the ring is symmetric, but given that C2 has an OH, the symmetry is broken. So C1's hydrogens are unique.

Wait, actually, C1 is bonded to C2 (double) and C6. So, the two hydrogens on C1 are in different environments because C2 has an OH group. So, the hydrogens on C1 are not equivalent.

Moving on:

- C2: has an OH, a double bond to C1, and a single bond to C3. The two hydrogens on C2 (if any) would be in different environments because the OH is on C2 and the double bond is adjacent.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, in a cyclohexene, each carbon in the double bond has two substituents. So, in the case of C1 and C2 being double-bonded, each of them has two other single bonds. So, C2 is bonded to C1 (double), C3 (single), and has an OH group. So, the structure is:

C1=C2-OH

Wait, no, that's not right. The actual structure is that C1 is double-bonded to C2, C2 has an OH, and is single-bonded to C3 and C6.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The actual structure of cyclohex-1-en-2-ol would have the double bond between C1 and C2, and an OH group on C2.

So, the structure would be:

C1=C2-OH

But that's not possible because each carbon in a double bond has two substituents. Oh, perhaps it's more accurate to say that C1 is double-bonded to C2, and C2 has an OH group and is attached to C3 and C6.

So, the molecule has the following substituents:

- C1: double bond to C2 and single bond to C6.
- C2: double bond to C1, single bonds to C3 and C6, and an OH group.
- C3: single bonds to C2 and C4.
- C4: single bonds to C3 and C5.
- C5: single bonds to C4 and C6.
- C6: single bonds to C5 and C1.

Wait, but that would make the ring structure as follows:

C1=C2-C3-C4-C5-C6-C1.

But that's a five-membered ring? No, wait, no, because C1 is connected to C2 and C6, which is correct for a six-membered ring.

Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine the structure as:

C1=C2-C3-C4-C5-C6, with C6 connected back to C1 to complete the ring.

But then, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OH is on C2.

So, C2 has three substituents: the double bond to C1, a single bond to C3, and the OH group.

Wait, but then C2 would have four bonds: two from the double bond (so, one from each side), a single bond to C3, and an OH. Wait, no, that's not possible. Because each carbon has four bonds. So, C2 is double-bonded to C1 (two bonds), single-bonded to C3 (one bond), and has an OH group (one bond). That adds up to four bonds, so that works.

Now, the molecule is cyclohex-1-en-2-ol.

Now, let's think about the symmetry.

Since the OH is on C2 and the double bond is between C1 and C2, the molecule lacks symmetry. So, each hydrogen attached to the carbons will have unique environments.

But wait, perhaps some hydrogens are equivalent due to the ring's structure.

Let's go through each carbon and count the hydrogens:

C1: double bonded to C2. So, C1 has two hydrogens attached. Are these hydrogens equivalent? Since C2 has an OH group, the two hydrogens on C1 are in different environments because one is adjacent to the OH-bearing C2, and the other is adjacent to C6, which is perhaps in a different environment.

Wait, but without knowing the exact structure, it's a bit tricky, but perhaps the hydrogens on C1 are all in the same environment. No, probably not because the adjacent C2 has the OH, which makes the two H's on C1 non-equivalent.

Wait, alternatively, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, some H's might be equivalent. But in this case, with the OH on C2 and the double bond between C1 and C2, I don't think there's such symmetry.

So, let's proceed:

C1: two H's, which are not equivalent.

C2: has an OH, so no H's attached.

C3: has two H's. Are they in equivalent environments? Let's see. C3 is connected to C2 (which has an OH) and C4. So, the two H's on C3 are in different environments? Or are they equivalent because of the ring's structure?

Wait, maybe the two H's on C3 are equivalent due to the ring's planarity. Because the ring is not symmetrical, but perhaps the two H's are on the same side of the ring, leading them to be equivalent.

Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me think. In cyclohexene, the double bond causes some planarity, but the ring is not fully planar.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is in a chair conformation, but since it's a cyclohexene, the ring is more like a boat or a chair, but that's more for cyclohexane. In any case, the symmetry is low, so the H's on C3 are probably not equivalent.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each H's environment. For each H, what substituents are adjacent?

C1: H's attached to C1. Each H is adjacent to C2 (with OH), so their environments are the same because both are next to C2. Wait, but C1's H's are on either side of the double bond. So, perhaps they are in different environments. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps they are equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should count each H as unique unless there's a clear symmetry.

So, C1: two H's, which are in different environments.

C3: two H's. Depending on the substituents, perhaps they're in different environments.

C4: two H's, perhaps in a symmetric position.

Wait, perhaps C4 is attached to C3 and C5. If C3 is connected to C2 (OH), then C4's environment is influenced by that.

Wait, but without knowing the exact positions, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has some symmetry that I'm not seeing.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider the number of unique H's by looking at the structure.

Each carbon in the ring (C1 to C6) has two H's except where there are substituents (like C2, which has an OH and no H's), or perhaps some have more.

Wait, but let's clarify:

C1: two H's (each attached to C1).

C2: no H's (since it has an OH, a double bond, and two single bonds to C3 and C6).

Wait, wait, no. Wait, C2 is double bonded to C1, single bonded to C3, and single bonded to C6, and has an OH group. That's four bonds, so no H's on C2.

C3: two H's.

C4: two H's.

C5: two H's.

C6: two H's.

So, in total, that's 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8 H's.

Wait, but wait, C1 has two H's, C3 has two, C4 has two, C5 has two, and C6 has two. That's 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8. No, wait, wait: C1, C3, C4, C5, C6 each have two H's.

Wait, but that can't be right because the molecule has six carbons in a ring. Let me recount.

Wait, each carbon in the ring has two H's except those with substituents.

In cyclohexene, each carbon except those in the double bond has two H's. But in this case, C2 has an OH substituent, so no H's on C2. C1 is part of the double bond, so it has two H's. The other carbons (C3, C4, C5, C6) have two H's each.

So, total H's: (C1:2) + (C3:2) + (C4:2) + (C5:2) + (C6:2) = 2 + 2 +2 +2 +2=10 H's.

Wait, but that can't be right because the cyclohexene ring has 10 H's in total? Wait, no. Cyclohexene has five double bonds and one double bond, but in any case, each carbon in the ring has two H's except for those in the double bond.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. For cyclohexene (without substituents), each of the six carbons has two H's except for the two in the double bond, which have one H each. So, total H's would be 6 * 2 - 2 = 10 H's. But in our case, product 4 has an OH group on C2, so C2 has no H's. So, the total H's would be:

C1: 2 H's

C2: 0 H's

C3: 2 H's

C4: 2 H's

C5: 2 H's

C6: 2 H's

Total: 2 + 0 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10 H's.

Wait, but that's 10 hydrogens, but the question is about chemically distinct (non-equivalent) H's.

So, product 4 has 10 hydrogens, but some may be equivalent.

Now, the tricky part is determining how many of these are chemically distinct.

So, looking at each position:

C1: two H's. Are they equivalent? Since the molecule is not symmetrical, these two H's are on opposite sides of the double bond. Are they in the same environment? Because the double bond is between C1 and C2, the two H's on C1 are on either side of the double bond. Are they equivalent? It depends on the substituents. Since C2 has an OH group, the two H's on C1 might be in different environments. So, these two H's are different.

C3: two H's. Are they equivalent? Let's see. C3 is connected to C2 (OH) and C4. The two H's on C3 are on either side of the ring. Are they in the same environment? Since the ring is not symmetrical, these H's might be different. So, two distinct H's.

C4: two H's. Are they equivalent? C4 is connected to C3 and C5. But the ring's substituents are on C2, which is two positions away. So, the two H's on C4 are in the same environment because the substituents are symmetrically placed around the ring. So, these two H's are equivalent.

Wait, let me think again. The substituents are on C2 and, perhaps, on C6? No, C6 is connected to C5 and C1. So, the substituent is only on C2. So, the two H's on C4 are on opposite sides of the ring, but because the substituent is only on C2, their environments are the same. So, these two H's are equivalent.

C5: two H's. Are they equivalent? C5 is connected to C4 and C6. The substituent is on C2, which is two positions away. So, the two H's on C5 are in the same environment, making them equivalent.

C6: two H's. Are they equivalent? C6 is connected to C5 and C1. The substituent is on C2, which is two positions away. So, the two H's on C6 are in the same environment, making them equivalent.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the positions again.

In the ring, the substituent (OH) is on C2. So, the positions around the ring are:

C1: next to C2 (with OH) and C6.

C3: next to C2 (OH) and C4.

C4: next to C3 and C5.

C5: next to C4 and C6.

C6: next to C5 and C1.

So, the substituent is on C2, affecting the environments of C1, C3, and perhaps others.

So, the H's on C4 and C5: Since the substituent is on C2, which is two positions away from C4 and C5, perhaps the H's on C4 are each influenced by C2's substituent. Are the two H's on C4 equivalent?

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes the H's on C4 and C5 equivalent, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the chair conformation (if applicable) to determine the equivalence of H's.

But since the molecule has a double bond, it's more likely to be in a chair-like or boat-like conformation, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the molecule as having a plane of symmetry that bisects the ring through C2 and C6. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, another approach: let's consider each set of H's and determine if they're equivalent.

C1: two H's. Since C1 is adjacent to C2 (OH), the two H's on C1 are in different environments because one is adjacent to the OH group on one side, and the other is on the opposite side. So, they are not equivalent. So, two distinct H's here.

C3: two H's. C3 is adjacent to C2 (OH) and C4. So, the two H's on C3 are in different environments. So, two distinct H's.

C4: two H's. Are these two H's equivalent? C4 is connected to C3 and C5. But since C3 is adjacent to C2 (OH), the environment around C4's H's may be influenced. However, the two H's on C4 are on opposite sides of the ring. Without a plane of symmetry through C4, these H's might be equivalent. Or perhaps they're not, due to the substituent on C2.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to assume that the H's on C4 are equivalent. So, that's one set.

C5: two H's. Similar to C4, but connected to C4 and C6. The substituent is on C2, which is two positions away. So, the two H's on C5 are on opposite sides of the ring and may be equivalent because of the ring's symmetry. So, one set.

C6: two H's. Connected to C5 and C1. The substituent is on C2, which is two positions away. So, the two H's on C6 are in the same environment, making them equivalent. So, one set.

So, putting it all together:

C1: 2 H's (distinct) → 2
C3: 2 H's (distinct) → 2
C4: 2 H's (equivalent) → 1
C5: 2 H's (equivalent) → 1
C6: 2 H's (equivalent) → 1

Total distinct H's: 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7.

Wait, that adds up to 7. So, the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4 is 7.

Looking back at the options, that would correspond to option D) 7.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4, we analyze the reaction sequence and the structure of the final compound.

### Reaction Sequence Analysis:
1. **Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Br₂ → Product 1**  
   Cyclohexanone undergoes bromination at the alpha position (C2), forming 2-bromocyclohexanone.

2. **Step 2: Product 1 + NaOH, heat → Product 2**  
   The bromine atom on C2 is eliminated via an E2 mechanism, forming cyclohex-1-en-2-one (an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone).

3. **Step 3: Product 2 + SOCl₂, pyridine → Product 3**  
   The ketone group on C2 is converted into an acyl chloride, forming cyclohex-1-en-2-yl chloride.

4. **Step 4: Product 3 + LiAlH(t-Bu)₃ → Product 4**  
   The acyl chloride is reduced to a primary alcohol, forming cyclohex-1-en-2-ol.

### Structure of Product 4:
- Product 4 is cyclohex-1-en-2-ol, with:
  - A double bond between C1 and C2.
  - An OH group on C2.
  - A six-membered ring with hydrogens on C1, C3, C4, C5, and C6.

### Determining Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms:
1. **C1**: Two hydrogens attached to C1. These are in different environments due to the double bond and the OH group on C2. **Distinct: 2**.
2. **C2**: No hydrogens (OH group is present). **Distinct: 0**.
3. **C3**: Two hydrogens attached to C3. These are in different environments due to the substituents on C2 and the double bond. **Distinct: 2**.
4. **C4**: Two hydrogens attached to C4. These are equivalent because the substituents on the ring create symmetry around C4. **Distinct: 1**.
5. **C5**: Two hydrogens attached to C5. These are equivalent because the substituents on the ring create symmetry around C5. **Distinct: 1**.
6. **C6**: Two hydrogens attached to C6. These are equivalent because the substituents on the ring create symmetry around C6. **Distinct: 1**.

### Total Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms:
Adding these, the total number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms is:  
\[ 2 \, (C1) + 2 \, (C3) + 1 \, (C4) + 1 \, (C5) + 1 \, (C6) = 7 \]

Thus, the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4 is **7**.

**Answer: D**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in product 4 of this reaction sequence. Let me take it step by step because I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

Alright, the starting material is cyclohexanone. I know that cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring with a ketone group (a carbonyl). So, the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a (C=O) group attached.

First step: cyclohexanone is treated with bromine to form product 1. Hmm, when ketones react with bromine, I'm thinking maybe it's a halogenation. Wait, no, wait. Oh, wait, bromine can add to alkenes, but cyclohexanone doesn't have a double bond. Oh wait, maybe it's a ring-opening or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a haloform reaction? No, the haloform reaction usually happens with methyl ketones. Cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, not a methyl ketone. So that might not apply here.

Wait another thought: Maybe it's a benzylic bromination. Oh, wait, cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group, which is adjacent to a CH2 group (the carbonyl is attached to a CH2, right? Because the structure is cyclohexane with a carbonyl. So maybe the alpha position is the CH2 next to the carbonyl.

Wait, benzylic bromination would require a benzene ring attached, but cyclohexanone isn't benzene. Oh, but wait, isn't the cyclohexanone a six-membered ring with a ketone? So the carbonyl is part of the ring. No, wait, no, cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group as a substituent. The structure is a cyclohexane ring with a (C=O) group attached. So the adjacent carbons are the ones attached to the ketone. So the alpha carbons are the two CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyl.

Wait, so when cyclohexanone is treated with bromine, maybe it undergoes some kind of addition or substitution. Alternatively, perhaps it's a bromohydrination? But I think that's when water is present. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a keto-enol tautomerism situation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Bromine (Br2) in certain conditions can lead to the formation of dibromides. In the presence of a ketone, perhaps it's a conjugate addition or some kind of dihalide formation.

Wait, another thought: Maybe it's a bromination via an enolate. Oh, right! If a ketone is treated with a strong base, it can form an enolate, which then reacts with an electrophile like bromine. But wait, in this case, the reagent is bromine, not a base. So maybe the conditions aren't basic. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a dihalogenation via the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that's with an oxidizing agent and gives a ketone oxide, which isn't relevant here.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. Product 1 is formed by treating cyclohexanone with bromine. Another possibility: cyclohexanone can undergo a bromination at the alpha position because the alpha carbons are more reactive due to the carbonyl group. So, perhaps the alpha position undergoes bromination.

Wait, but how does that happen? Oh, maybe it's a radical bromination, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the bromine could add across the carbonyl group, but that doesn't make much sense because ketones typically don't open up with bromine without some catalyst.

Wait, maybe the bromine is adding via an enol intermediate. So cyclohexanone would form an enol, which then reacts with bromine. But without a base, would that happen? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a bromination at the alpha position via a mechanism where the carbonyl group activates the adjacent C-H bonds, making them susceptible to bromine. So, maybe a single bromine is added at one of the alpha positions.

Wait, but cyclohexanone has two equivalent alpha positions (the two CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyl). So if bromine adds once, it would add to one of them, but they're equivalent, so product 1 would be 1-bromo-cyclohexanone. But wait, if that's the case, the bromine would be on a CH2 group. But wait, no, the alpha carbons in cyclohexanone are each CH2 groups attached to the carbonyl.

Wait, so if the reaction adds a bromine to one of the alpha carbons, then product 1 would be 1-bromo-cyclohexanone. But the positions are symmetrical, so the bromine could be on either side.

Wait, but wait another thing: The reaction of ketones with bromine can lead to the formation of a 1,2-dibromide. Is that possible? Like, the bromine adds across the carbonyl? No, because the carbonyl is a C=O, not a double bond between two carbons. Adding bromine across a carbonyl would require some acidic conditions or something. Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexanone undergoes some kind of ring-opening in the presence of bromine. I'm not too sure.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of another approach. Perhaps the first step is a diaddition, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's a bromide substitution on the carbonyl oxygen? No, the carbonyl oxygen is not a good leaving group. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the next steps. Maybe product 1 is something that when heated with NaOH forms product 2, which is then treated with SOCl2 and pyridine to form product 3, and then treated with LiAlH(t-Bu)3 to form product 4.

Wait, let's see the sequence:

1. Cyclohexanone + Br2 → product 1
2. Product 1 + NaOH, heat → product 2
3. Product 2 + SOCl2, pyridine → product 3
4. Product 3 + LiAlH(t-Bu)3 → product 4

So, perhaps each step is a known reaction. Maybe I can think about each step.

First step: cyclohexanone + Br2 → perhaps a di-substitution? Or maybe a vicinal dihalide? Or maybe a bromide at the alpha position.

Wait, another idea: maybe the bromine is adding to the carbonyl group, but that would form a bromide in the alpha position. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dibromide via some kind of addition.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution. Wait, but cyclohexanone doesn't have a good leaving group. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's the formation of a benzilic acid bromide, but that's when the alpha carbon is converted into a bromide by cleavage. But that's more in haloform reaction, which requires a methyl ketone. Oh, but cyclohexanone isn't a methyl ketone. So perhaps that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine is adding to the cyclohexanone in some way, but I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps it's a bromohydrin formation. So, when a ketone reacts with bromine and water, it forms a bromohydrin. But in this step, the reagent is just bromine. So maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening. Wait, cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring. If bromine adds across the carbonyl, but I don't think that's possible. Alternatively, perhaps the ring isn't opening, but the bromine is adding to the ring.

Wait, perhaps it's a bromine addition across the carbonyl, but that doesn't make sense because adding Br2 to a carbonyl would require some sort of conjugation or an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, which cyclohexanone isn't.

Hmm, maybe I'm stuck on the first step. Let's think about the second step. Product 1 is treated with NaOH and heat to form product 2. So, perhaps product 1 is a dibromide or a bromide that, upon treatment with base, undergoes elimination or substitution.

Wait, for example, if product 1 is a vicinal dibromide, then treatment with NaOH and heat would lead to an elimination reaction, forming an alkene. So, product 2 would be an alkene.

Alternatively, if product 1 is a mono-bromide, then treatment with NaOH could lead to substitution, but in a ketone, the leaving group would have to be on an adjacent position.

Wait, perhaps the first reaction is a di-substitution, adding two bromines to adjacent positions. Let me imagine the cyclohexanone ring. If the carbonyl is at position 1, then adding two Br atoms to positions 2 and 3, making a 2,3-dibromocyclohexanone. Then, when treated with NaOH and heat, it could eliminate to form a double bond between C2 and C3. So product 2 would be cyclohexenone (cyclohex-2-enone, perhaps).

Alternatively, product 1 could be a bromide on the alpha carbon, and upon treatment with NaOH, it would eliminate the OH group (if any) to form an alkene.

Wait, but if product 1 is a bromide on the alpha carbon, then in the second step, perhaps it's a dehydration. So, product 2 is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone.

Wait, that makes sense. So, the first step is bromination of the alpha position, giving 1-bromo-cyclohexanone.

Then, in the second step, treatment with NaOH and heat would cause elimination, removing H and Br to form a double bond. So product 2 would be cyclohex-1-enone (or perhaps cyclohex-2-enone, depending on where the Br was).

Wait, but cyclohexanone has the carbonyl at position 1, so the adjacent alpha carbons are 2 and 6. So if the bromine is added to position 2, then elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2, making cyclohex-1-enone. But wait, that's not possible because the carbonyl is at C1, and the double bond would be between C1 and C2, making it a conjugated enone, which is possible.

Wait, but when you eliminate H and Br from adjacent positions, the double bond forms between those positions. So if the Br is on C2, then elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2, resulting in cyclohex-1-enone.

So product 2 is cyclohexenone, which is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone.

Then, the third step is treating product 2 with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine to form product 3.

Thionyl chloride typically converts ketones or aldehydes into chlorides. Wait, but product 2 is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. So, perhaps the carbonyl group is converted into an acyl chloride. So, product 3 would be the acyl chloride version of product 2, i.e., cyclohexenyl chloride or something like that.

Wait, the structure would be the enone (double bond between C1 and C2, carbonyl at C1) converted into a chlorinated carbonyl. Wait, no, more accurately, the ketone (O) becomes OCl, but more accurately, the oxygen is replaced with Cl. So, the ketone (O=C-) becomes Cl-C-Cl, but wait, no, the carbonyl group becomes Cl.

Wait, no, when a ketone reacts with SOCl2, it's converted into an acyl chloride. So, for example, cyclohexanone would become cyclohexanoyl chloride. So product 2 is cyclohexenone, which is (Z)- or (E)-cyclohexen-1-one. Then, treating that with SOCl2 would convert the ketone into an acyl chloride. So product 3 is cyclohexenoyl chloride.

Wait, but the position of the double bond is important here. So, if product 2 is cyclohex-1-en-2-one, then product 3 would be cyclohex-1-en-2-yl chloride, but I'm not exactly sure about the nomenclature here.

Wait, but let me think more about the structure. Product 2 is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, so it's something like cyclohexenone. Then, product 3 is the corresponding acyl chloride, so it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated acyl chloride.

Now, the fourth step is treating product 3 with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(t-Bu)3), which is a strong reducing agent. Wait, but wait, acyl chlorides are typically reduced to alcohols using LiAlH4. But this is a modified version, LiAlH(t-Bu)3, which I think is a bulky reducing agent, perhaps used for stereoselective reductions, like in the Birch reduction or in reducing esters or amides.

Wait, in any case, when an acyl chloride is treated with a strong reducing agent like LiAlH4, it's usually reduced to the corresponding alcohol. So, product 4 would be the alcohol derived from the acyl chloride.

Wait, but let's go through the steps again.

Product 3 is an acyl chloride. So, when you reduce an acyl chloride with a hydride, you end up with a primary alcohol. But wait, in this case, the carbonyl is part of an alpha,beta-unsaturated system. So, the acyl chloride is an alpha,beta-unsaturated acyl chloride, meaning that the carbonyl is conjugated with a double bond.

So, when you reduce an alpha,beta-unsaturated acyl chloride, maybe the reduction could be more complex. I think that in such cases, the reduction could lead to the conjugate addition of the hydride, or maybe just the direct reduction of the carbonyl.

Wait, no, LiAlH(t-Bu)3 is a strong enough reducing agent that it can reduce the acyl chloride. The reaction would typically give the corresponding alcohol. So, the structure would have the double bond still intact, and the carbonyl (O) would be replaced by an OH group.

Wait, so product 4 would be an alpha,beta-unsaturated alcohol. So, the structure would have a double bond and an OH group in conjugation.

Wait, but let's imagine the structure. So, product 2 is cyclohex-1-en-2-one. So, the ring has a double bond between C1 and C2, and the carbonyl is at C2. So, product 3 would be cyclohex-1-en-2-yl chloride. Then, reducing that would convert the carbonyl (O) into an OH. But wait, in the acyl chloride, the carbonyl is Cl, so upon reduction, it becomes an -OH group.

Wait, but if the structure is cyclohex-1-en-2-yl chloride, then after reduction, it becomes cyclohex-1-en-2-ol. So, a cyclohexene ring with an OH group on C2 and a double bond between C1 and C2.

Wait, but wait, let's think about the actual structure. Let me draw it out in my mind. The cyclohexane ring has five single bonds and one double bond. So, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The OH is on C2, and C2 is also connected to the rest of the ring.

Wait, but in such a structure, how many equivalent hydrogens are there?

Hmm, let's think about the symmetry. The molecule would have a double bond between C1 and C2, and an OH group on C2. The ring is a six-membered ring. So, the substituents are on C1 (part of the double bond) and C2 (OH group).

So, the molecule is cyclohex-1-en-2-ol. Now, the question is about the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4.

So, let me imagine the structure of cyclohex-1-en-2-ol. The ring has a double bond between C1 and C2, and an OH group on C2.

Wait, but wait, cyclohex-1-en-2-ol would have the structure where the double bond is between C1 and C2 (so, positions 1 and 2 are double-bonded), and the OH is on C2. So, the substituents are on adjacent carbons.

Wait, but in cyclohexene, the positions are numbered such that the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the ring is numbered in a way that gives the lowest possible numbers.

So, in this molecule, after the reduction, the structure is cyclohex-1-en-2-ol.

Now, let's determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.

I need to look for symmetry in the molecule. Because the molecule has a double bond and an OH group, the symmetry is limited.

Let's number the carbons in the ring as follows:

Carbon 1: double bond to C2.

Carbon 2: attached to OH and connected to C1 (double bond) and C3.

Carbon 3: connected to C2 and C4.

Carbon 4: connected to C3 and C5.

Carbon 5: connected to C4 and C6.

Carbon 6: connected to C5 and C1.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, in cyclohexene with a double bond between C1 and C2, the ring is arranged such that C1 is connected to C2 via double bond, C2 is connected to C3, and so on, up to C6 connected back to C1.

Wait, no, that's not possible because in a six-membered ring, a double bond between C1 and C2 would mean that C2 is connected to C1 (double) and C3 (single), and C3 is connected to C4, etc., up to C6 connected to C1.

Wait, but in a cyclohexene ring, the numbering would be such that the double bond is between adjacent carbons. So, the molecule would look like:

C1 double bonded to C2, C2 single bonded to C3, C3 single bonded to C4, C4 single bonded to C5, C5 single bonded to C6, and C6 single bonded to C1. Wait, that can't be right because that would make a ring with five single bonds and one double, but that's impossible in a six-membered ring. Oh, wait no, in a six-membered ring, each carbon is bonded to two others, so a double bond between C1 and C2 would mean that C1 is bonded to C2 (double) and C6 (single), and C2 is bonded to C1 (double), C3 (single), and maybe other substituents.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the numbering. Let me think of the structure as a cyclohexene ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, and an OH group on C2.

So, the molecule would have the following arrangement:

- C1 is double-bonded to C2.
- C2 has an OH group, is double bonded to C1, and single bonded to C3.
- C3 is single bonded to C2 and C4.
- C4 is single bonded to C3 and C5.
- C5 is single bonded to C4 and C6.
- C6 is single bonded to C5 and C1.

Wait, but that makes a ring of six carbons with a double bond between C1 and C2, and an OH on C2.

Now, let's consider the symmetry. The molecule is not symmetrical because of the double bond and the OH group. So, each position may have a unique hydrogen environment.

But let me think: Are any of the hydrogens equivalent?

Let's list the hydrogens on each carbon:

- C1: attached to C2 (double bond) and C6. The hydrogens on C1 would be equivalent if the ring is symmetric, but given that C2 has an OH, the symmetry is broken. So C1's hydrogens are unique.

Wait, actually, C1 is bonded to C2 (double) and C6. So, the two hydrogens on C1 are in different environments because C2 has an OH group. So, the hydrogens on C1 are not equivalent.

Moving on:

- C2: has an OH, a double bond to C1, and a single bond to C3. The two hydrogens on C2 (if any) would be in different environments because the OH is on C2 and the double bond is adjacent.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, in a cyclohexene, each carbon in the double bond has two substituents. So, in the case of C1 and C2 being double-bonded, each of them has two other single bonds. So, C2 is bonded to C1 (double), C3 (single), and has an OH group. So, the structure is:

C1=C2-OH

Wait, no, that's not right. The actual structure is that C1 is double-bonded to C2, C2 has an OH, and is single-bonded to C3 and C6.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The actual structure of cyclohex-1-en-2-ol would have the double bond between C1 and C2, and an OH group on C2.

So, the structure would be:

C1=C2-OH

But that's not possible because each carbon in a double bond has two substituents. Oh, perhaps it's more accurate to say that C1 is double-bonded to C2, and C2 has an OH group and is attached to C3 and C6.

So, the molecule has the following substituents:

- C1: double bond to C2 and single bond to C6.
- C2: double bond to C1, single bonds to C3 and C6, and an OH group.
- C3: single bonds to C2 and C4.
- C4: single bonds to C3 and C5.
- C5: single bonds to C4 and C6.
- C6: single bonds to C5 and C1.

Wait, but that would make the ring structure as follows:

C1=C2-C3-C4-C5-C6-C1.

But that's a five-membered ring? No, wait, no, because C1 is connected to C2 and C6, which is correct for a six-membered ring.

Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine the structure as:

C1=C2-C3-C4-C5-C6, with C6 connected back to C1 to complete the ring.

But then, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OH is on C2.

So, C2 has three substituents: the double bond to C1, a single bond to C3, and the OH group.

Wait, but then C2 would have four bonds: two from the double bond (so, one from each side), a single bond to C3, and an OH. Wait, no, that's not possible. Because each carbon has four bonds. So, C2 is double-bonded to C1 (two bonds), single-bonded to C3 (one bond), and has an OH group (one bond). That adds up to four bonds, so that works.

Now, the molecule is cyclohex-1-en-2-ol.

Now, let's think about the symmetry.

Since the OH is on C2 and the double bond is between C1 and C2, the molecule lacks symmetry. So, each hydrogen attached to the carbons will have unique environments.

But wait, perhaps some hydrogens are equivalent due to the ring's structure.

Let's go through each carbon and count the hydrogens:

C1: double bonded to C2. So, C1 has two hydrogens attached. Are these hydrogens equivalent? Since C2 has an OH group, the two hydrogens on C1 are in different environments because one is adjacent to the OH-bearing C2, and the other is adjacent to C6, which is perhaps in a different environment.

Wait, but without knowing the exact structure, it's a bit tricky, but perhaps the hydrogens on C1 are all in the same environment. No, probably not because the adjacent C2 has the OH, which makes the two H's on C1 non-equivalent.

Wait, alternatively, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, some H's might be equivalent. But in this case, with the OH on C2 and the double bond between C1 and C2, I don't think there's such symmetry.

So, let's proceed:

C1: two H's, which are not equivalent.

C2: has an OH, so no H's attached.

C3: has two H's. Are they in equivalent environments? Let's see. C3 is connected to C2 (which has an OH) and C4. So, the two H's on C3 are in different environments? Or are they equivalent because of the ring's structure?

Wait, maybe the two H's on C3 are equivalent due to the ring's planarity. Because the ring is not symmetrical, but perhaps the two H's are on the same side of the ring, leading them to be equivalent.

Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me think. In cyclohexene, the double bond causes some planarity, but the ring is not fully planar.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is in a chair conformation, but since it's a cyclohexene, the ring is more like a boat or a chair, but that's more for cyclohexane. In any case, the symmetry is low, so the H's on C3 are probably not equivalent.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each H's environment. For each H, what substituents are adjacent?

C1: H's attached to C1. Each H is adjacent to C2 (with OH), so their environments are the same because both are next to C2. Wait, but C1's H's are on either side of the double bond. So, perhaps they are in different environments. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps they are equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should count each H as unique unless there's a clear symmetry.

So, C1: two H's, which are in different environments.

C3: two H's. Depending on the substituents, perhaps they're in different environments.

C4: two H's, perhaps in a symmetric position.

Wait, perhaps C4 is attached to C3 and C5. If C3 is connected to C2 (OH), then C4's environment is influenced by that.

Wait, but without knowing the exact positions, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has some symmetry that I'm not seeing.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider the number of unique H's by looking at the structure.

Each carbon in the ring (C1 to C6) has two H's except where there are substituents (like C2, which has an OH and no H's), or perhaps some have more.

Wait, but let's clarify:

C1: two H's (each attached to C1).

C2: no H's (since it has an OH, a double bond, and two single bonds to C3 and C6).

Wait, wait, no. Wait, C2 is double bonded to C1, single bonded to C3, and single bonded to C6, and has an OH group. That's four bonds, so no H's on C2.

C3: two H's.

C4: two H's.

C5: two H's.

C6: two H's.

So, in total, that's 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8 H's.

Wait, but wait, C1 has two H's, C3 has two, C4 has two, C5 has two, and C6 has two. That's 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8. No, wait, wait: C1, C3, C4, C5, C6 each have two H's.

Wait, but that can't be right because the molecule has six carbons in a ring. Let me recount.

Wait, each carbon in the ring has two H's except those with substituents.

In cyclohexene, each carbon except those in the double bond has two H's. But in this case, C2 has an OH substituent, so no H's on C2. C1 is part of the double bond, so it has two H's. The other carbons (C3, C4, C5, C6) have two H's each.

So, total H's: (C1:2) + (C3:2) + (C4:2) + (C5:2) + (C6:2) = 2 + 2 +2 +2 +2=10 H's.

Wait, but that can't be right because the cyclohexene ring has 10 H's in total? Wait, no. Cyclohexene has five double bonds and one double bond, but in any case, each carbon in the ring has two H's except for those in the double bond.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. For cyclohexene (without substituents), each of the six carbons has two H's except for the two in the double bond, which have one H each. So, total H's would be 6 * 2 - 2 = 10 H's. But in our case, product 4 has an OH group on C2, so C2 has no H's. So, the total H's would be:

C1: 2 H's

C2: 0 H's

C3: 2 H's

C4: 2 H's

C5: 2 H's

C6: 2 H's

Total: 2 + 0 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10 H's.

Wait, but that's 10 hydrogens, but the question is about chemically distinct (non-equivalent) H's.

So, product 4 has 10 hydrogens, but some may be equivalent.

Now, the tricky part is determining how many of these are chemically distinct.

So, looking at each position:

C1: two H's. Are they equivalent? Since the molecule is not symmetrical, these two H's are on opposite sides of the double bond. Are they in the same environment? Because the double bond is between C1 and C2, the two H's on C1 are on either side of the double bond. Are they equivalent? It depends on the substituents. Since C2 has an OH group, the two H's on C1 might be in different environments. So, these two H's are different.

C3: two H's. Are they equivalent? Let's see. C3 is connected to C2 (OH) and C4. The two H's on C3 are on either side of the ring. Are they in the same environment? Since the ring is not symmetrical, these H's might be different. So, two distinct H's.

C4: two H's. Are they equivalent? C4 is connected to C3 and C5. But the ring's substituents are on C2, which is two positions away. So, the two H's on C4 are in the same environment because the substituents are symmetrically placed around the ring. So, these two H's are equivalent.

Wait, let me think again. The substituents are on C2 and, perhaps, on C6? No, C6 is connected to C5 and C1. So, the substituent is only on C2. So, the two H's on C4 are on opposite sides of the ring, but because the substituent is only on C2, their environments are the same. So, these two H's are equivalent.

C5: two H's. Are they equivalent? C5 is connected to C4 and C6. The substituent is on C2, which is two positions away. So, the two H's on C5 are in the same environment, making them equivalent.

C6: two H's. Are they equivalent? C6 is connected to C5 and C1. The substituent is on C2, which is two positions away. So, the two H's on C6 are in the same environment, making them equivalent.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the positions again.

In the ring, the substituent (OH) is on C2. So, the positions around the ring are:

C1: next to C2 (with OH) and C6.

C3: next to C2 (OH) and C4.

C4: next to C3 and C5.

C5: next to C4 and C6.

C6: next to C5 and C1.

So, the substituent is on C2, affecting the environments of C1, C3, and perhaps others.

So, the H's on C4 and C5: Since the substituent is on C2, which is two positions away from C4 and C5, perhaps the H's on C4 are each influenced by C2's substituent. Are the two H's on C4 equivalent?

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes the H's on C4 and C5 equivalent, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the chair conformation (if applicable) to determine the equivalence of H's.

But since the molecule has a double bond, it's more likely to be in a chair-like or boat-like conformation, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the molecule as having a plane of symmetry that bisects the ring through C2 and C6. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, another approach: let's consider each set of H's and determine if they're equivalent.

C1: two H's. Since C1 is adjacent to C2 (OH), the two H's on C1 are in different environments because one is adjacent to the OH group on one side, and the other is on the opposite side. So, they are not equivalent. So, two distinct H's here.

C3: two H's. C3 is adjacent to C2 (OH) and C4. So, the two H's on C3 are in different environments. So, two distinct H's.

C4: two H's. Are these two H's equivalent? C4 is connected to C3 and C5. But since C3 is adjacent to C2 (OH), the environment around C4's H's may be influenced. However, the two H's on C4 are on opposite sides of the ring. Without a plane of symmetry through C4, these H's might be equivalent. Or perhaps they're not, due to the substituent on C2.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to assume that the H's on C4 are equivalent. So, that's one set.

C5: two H's. Similar to C4, but connected to C4 and C6. The substituent is on C2, which is two positions away. So, the two H's on C5 are on opposite sides of the ring and may be equivalent because of the ring's symmetry. So, one set.

C6: two H's. Connected to C5 and C1. The substituent is on C2, which is two positions away. So, the two H's on C6 are in the same environment, making them equivalent. So, one set.

So, putting it all together:

C1: 2 H's (distinct) → 2
C3: 2 H's (distinct) → 2
C4: 2 H's (equivalent) → 1
C5: 2 H's (equivalent) → 1
C6: 2 H's (equivalent) → 1

Total distinct H's: 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7.

Wait, that adds up to 7. So, the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4 is 7.

Looking back at the options, that would correspond to option D) 7.


To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4, we analyze the reaction sequence and the structure of the final compound.

### Reaction Sequence Analysis:
1. **Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Br₂ → Product 1**  
   Cyclohexanone undergoes bromination at the alpha position (C2), forming 2-bromocyclohexanone.

2. **Step 2: Product 1 + NaOH, heat → Product 2**  
   The bromine atom on C2 is eliminated via an E2 mechanism, forming cyclohex-1-en-2-one (an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone).

3. **Step 3: Product 2 + SOCl₂, pyridine → Product 3**  
   The ketone group on C2 is converted into an acyl chloride, forming cyclohex-1-en-2-yl chloride.

4. **Step 4: Product 3 + LiAlH(t-Bu)₃ → Product 4**  
   The acyl chloride is reduced to a primary alcohol, forming cyclohex-1-en-2-ol.

### Structure of Product 4:
- Product 4 is cyclohex-1-en-2-ol, with:
  - A double bond between C1 and C2.
  - An OH group on C2.
  - A six-membered ring with hydrogens on C1, C3, C4, C5, and C6.

### Determining Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms:
1. **C1**: Two hydrogens attached to C1. These are in different environments due to the double bond and the OH group on C2. **Distinct: 2**.
2. **C2**: No hydrogens (OH group is present). **Distinct: 0**.
3. **C3**: Two hydrogens attached to C3. These are in different environments due to the substituents on C2 and the double bond. **Distinct: 2**.
4. **C4**: Two hydrogens attached to C4. These are equivalent because the substituents on the ring create symmetry around C4. **Distinct: 1**.
5. **C5**: Two hydrogens attached to C5. These are equivalent because the substituents on the ring create symmetry around C5. **Distinct: 1**.
6. **C6**: Two hydrogens attached to C6. These are equivalent because the substituents on the ring create symmetry around C6. **Distinct: 1**.

### Total Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms:
Adding these, the total number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms is:  
\[ 2 \, (C1) + 2 \, (C3) + 1 \, (C4) + 1 \, (C5) + 1 \, (C6) = 7 \]

Thus, the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4 is **7**.
