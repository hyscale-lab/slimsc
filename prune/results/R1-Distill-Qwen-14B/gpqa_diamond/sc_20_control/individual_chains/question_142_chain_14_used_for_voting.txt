Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, the question is about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position in qubit space. I remember that density matrices are a way to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or entangled. 

The given density matrix is ρ = 1/2 (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, so this looks familiar. I think this is a diagonal matrix because the terms are |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1|. Each of these projectors is a matrix with 1 in the corresponding diagonal element and 0 elsewhere. So when I add them together and multiply by 1/2, each diagonal element becomes 1/2, and the off-diagonals are zero.

Let me write it out maybe. The |0⟩⟨0| matrix is [[1, 0],[0, 0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding these gives [[1,0],[0,1]], so when multiplied by 1/2, it's [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. So ρ is a 2x2 diagonal matrix with both diagonal elements equal to 1/2.

Wait, but what's the geometrical position in qubit space? I'm a bit fuzzy on that part. I remember that qubit states can be represented on the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a geometric representation of a qubit state. Each point on the sphere corresponds to a possible state of the qubit. The state is given by a unit vector (θ, φ), where θ is the polar angle and φ is the azimuthal angle.

But wait, this is a density matrix. I think density matrices are more general than pure states. For pure states, the density matrix is a projector, like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|. For mixed states, it's a statistical mixture. So, the given ρ is a mixed state because it's an equal mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩. 

Wait, how does the density matrix relate to the Bloch sphere? I remember that any 2x2 density matrix for a qubit can be written in terms of the Bloch vector components. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector (the Bloch vector) with components (x, y, z). This vector has a length ≤1 because the density matrix must be positive semi-definite.

So for the given ρ, let's compute it. Our ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me compute each component. The identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]]. The Pauli matrices are σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. 

So, applying the formula, ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z) / 2. Let's compute each term. 

Our given ρ is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. Let's express this in terms of I and the Pauli matrices. The identity matrix I gives [[1,0],[0,1]], so I/2 is [[1/2,0],[0,1/2]]. That's exactly the same as our ρ. So that means the other terms must sum to zero. 

So, (I + r·σ)/2 = I/2 + (r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2. Comparing this to our ρ, which is I/2, that implies that the sum of the Pauli terms must be zero. So r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z must be the zero matrix. 

Looking at the Pauli matrices, each is a different basis. The only way their linear combination can be zero is if each coefficient is zero. So r_x = 0, r_y = 0, r_z = 0. So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). 

Alternatively, I can think about this as the completely mixed state. When a qubit is in a completely mixed state, it's as if it's in a state that's maximally uncertain, which is equally likely to be |0⟩ or |1⟩. On the Bloch sphere, this corresponds to the origin because it's not pointing in any direction. So the Bloch vector is zero, meaning the state is (0,0,0) in the Bloch sphere representation.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So that must be the correct answer.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This is a diagonal matrix with both diagonal elements equal to \( \frac{1}{2} \), and the off-diagonal elements are zero. This represents a mixed state, specifically the maximally mixed state for a qubit. 

To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. Any qubit state can be expressed in terms of the Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \), where \( r_x, r_y, r_z \) are the components of the Bloch vector. The general form of a density matrix in terms of the Bloch vector is:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma},
\]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix and \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z) \) are the Pauli matrices. For the given \( \rho \), we have:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

This implies that the contributions from the Pauli matrices must cancel out, meaning the Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} \) must be zero. Therefore, the qubit is at the origin of the Bloch sphere, corresponding to the maximally mixed state.

From the options provided:

- **A) \( r = (1,1,0) \):** Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state on the Bloch sphere.
- **B) \( r = (0,0,1) \):** Incorrect, as this corresponds to the state \( |1\rangle \), which is a pure state.
- **C) \( r = (0,0,0) \):** Correct, as this corresponds to the maximally mixed state.
- **D) \( r = (1,1,1) \):** Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state on the Bloch sphere.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
