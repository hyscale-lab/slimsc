Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's a bit complex. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'll start by reading the question carefully and then think through each part.

The question is about binary compounds of fluorine with another element Y. There are five such compounds. The substances A1 to A5 are involved, and I need to figure out which ones they are and then determine the molecular weight range of A4.

Let me list what I know from the question:

1. A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, about 25°C) into A2 and fluorine. The oF of A2 is 31.96%. Oh wait, oF probably stands for the oxygen-free fraction, but wait, no—maybe it's the oxygen-free equivalent, or maybe it's the oxidation state. Wait, no, more likely, oF here stands for the oxygen-free fraction, which is the percentage of fluorine in the compound. Because fluorine is a halogen, and in binary compounds, the percentage would make sense. So A2 has 31.96% fluorine by mass.

2. A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. So A1 is a strong oxidizing agent. That makes me think of fluorine compounds, perhaps something like F2, but F2 is an element, not a compound. Wait, but A1 is a binary compound of F, so it's a compound with F and Y.

Wait, but fluorine itself is a strong oxidizing agent. So maybe A1 is a compound that's even more oxidizing than F2. Hmm.

Wait, but wait. Think of the known strong oxidizing fluorine compounds. For example, perhaps Y is oxygen? No, because oxygen is a chalcogen, but in that case, the fluorine compounds would be different. Alternatively, perhaps Y is another element. Alternatively, maybe Y is oxygen, but then the compounds would be things like OF2 or O2F2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe Y is another halogen? No, because fluorine is the most electronegative, so it would tend to form compounds where it's the acceptor. Alternatively, perhaps Y is something like chlorine, but that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe Y is oxygen or another element.

Wait, the problem states that A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So Y is an element that can form a compound with fluorine. So A3 is YF_x, perhaps. Then, when Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, concentrated solution of A4, you get A5. Hmm.

Let me think step by step.

First, let's consider A1. It's a bright red substance. That makes me think of fluorine's compounds. For example, ClF3 is a reddish-brown liquid, but I'm not sure about red. Wait, another thought: perhaps A1 is O2F2? I'm not sure what color that is. Alternatively, maybe it's FCl, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: When fluorine is in a high oxidation state, perhaps as in a compound like F2O. Wait, but F2O is not a common compound. Alternatively, perhaps A1 is FCl, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps A1 is ClF3. ClF3 is a greenish-yellow liquid, but does it decompose into something else and fluorine? Let me think about the decomposition of ClF3. When ClF3 decomposes, I think it forms Cl2 and F2. But wait, ClF3 is a binary compound of F and Cl. So in this case, Y would be Cl.

Wait, but in the decomposition, you get F2, which is fluorine, and another compound. So let's see: if A1 is ClF3, which is a binary compound of F and Cl, then when it decomposes, it would form Cl2 and F2. So A2 would be Cl2, maybe. But what's the fluorine percentage in Cl2? No, because Cl2 is pure chlorine, so that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps A2 is ClF.

Wait, perhaps I'm on the wrong track. Let's think again. Another approach: the decomposition of A1 gives F2 and another compound A2. So A1 must be a compound that breaks down into F2 and another substance.

Let's think about the fluorine percentage in A2. The oF is 31.96%. So the mass percent of fluorine in A2 is about 31.96%. So, what compounds have around 32% fluorine by mass?

Let me calculate possible molecular formulas. Let's say the formula is YF. Then the percentage would be (F's molar mass)/(Y + F's molar mass) * 100. F has a molar mass of about 19 g/mol.

So if the percentage is ~32%, then (19)/(Y +19) = 0.3196 → Y +19 ≈ 19/0.3196 ≈ 60 → Y ≈ 60 -19 =41. Y's atomic mass is about 41, which is around Ga? No, Ga is about 69.7. Wait, 41 is Ga? No, Ga is 69.7. Wait, 41 g/mol is perhaps something else. Wait, 41 is close to the atomic mass of potassium (K is about 39), but not exactly. Alternatively, maybe Y is something else.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the formula is YF3. Then fluorine's mass would be 3*19=57. The total molar mass would be Y +57. The percentage of fluorine is (57)/(Y+57) = 0.3196 → Y+57 ≈ 57 / 0.3196 ≈ 178 → Y ≈ 178-57=121. Hmm, that's high. Which element has an atomic mass around 121? I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the formula is YF2. Let's try that.

For YF2: F contributes 2*19=38. So (38)/(Y+38) = 0.3196 → Y+38 ≈ 38 /0.3196 ≈ 118.8 → Y ≈ 118.8 -38=80.8. That's close to lead (Pb is about 207, no) or maybe something else. Wait, 80.8 is close to strontium (Sr is about 87.6), but not exactly. Hmm, perhaps another approach.

Wait, maybe A2 is F₂O? No, because oxygen's molar mass is 16, so F2O would have F as 38/(16+38) =38/54 ≈ 69.8%, which is higher than 32%. So that's not it.

Wait, perhaps the formula is something like YF4. Then fluorine's mass is 4*19=76. So (76)/(Y +76) = 0.3196 → Y +76 ≈ 76/0.3196 ≈ 237.5 → Y ≈ 237.5 -76=161.5. Hmm, that's way too high for most elements. So maybe that's not the case.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps A2 is F2. But F2 is an element, not a compound. So no, that's not possible.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me try the initial calculation again.

In A2, the fluorine content is 31.96%. So, the mass of F is 31.96% of the molar mass of A2.

Let's suppose A2 is YF. The formula weight would be Y + 19.

Fluorine mass fraction: 19/(Y +19) = 0.3196 → Y +19 = 19 / 0.3196 ≈ 60 → Y ≈ 60 -19=41.

So Y would have an atomic mass of about 41. Let me think which element that is. Oh, that's Ga (gallium) is about 69.7, which is higher. Wait, 41 is close to K (potassium is about 39). Alternatively, maybe it's another element. Wait, the element with atomic number 19 is fluorine, but that's not Y here. Hmm.

Wait, wait, maybe Y is another element. Let's think about Y. The problem says there are five binary compounds of fluorine with Y. So Y is an element that forms five different binary compounds with fluorine. Hmm. Let's think of elements that form multiple fluorides.

For example, oxygen forms OF2 and O2F2 (but I'm not sure about the exact number). Alternatively, maybe Y is sulfur? Sulfur forms SF4, SF6, etc. Wait, but that's perhaps more than five. Alternatively, perhaps Y is chlorine, but that's a halogen and might not form multiple compounds with fluorine.

Wait, another thought: The problem says that A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is a noble gas, so it's typically unreactive, but can form compounds when reacting with strong oxidizing agents. So A1 has to be a strong oxidizing agent. Fluorine itself is a strong oxidizing agent, but A1 is a compound.

Wait, what about ClF3? ClF3 is a strong oxidizing agent. When ClF3 decomposes, it can produce Cl2 and F2. Let me think, but ClF3 is ClF3, so binary compound of Cl and F. So Y would be Cl in this case.

Wait, but in the decomposition of ClF3, does it produce Cl2 and F2? Let me think. ClF3 is a stable compound, but under certain conditions, it can decompose. For example, upon heating, ClF3 can decompose to Cl2 and F2. So, if A1 is ClF3, then when it decomposes, it produces Cl2 (A2) and F2.

But wait, Cl2 is a diatomic molecule, so A2 would be Cl2. But what's the fluorine percentage in Cl2? Cl2 is pure chlorine, so fluorine percentage is zero. That doesn't fit the 31.96% given. So this line of thought might be incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps I'm on the wrong track with Y being Cl. Let me think of another element.

Wait, another possibility: Y could be oxygen. O forms several fluorides, like OF2, O2F2, etc. Let me consider that.

If Y is oxygen, then A1 could be O2F2, perhaps. But does O2F2 decompose into something else and F2? I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps A1 is a different oxygen fluoride.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the properties of O2F2. Maybe another approach: think of A1 as a compound that's a strong oxidizing agent, maybe F2O (if that exists). But F2O isn't a common compound; maybe it's not stable.

Wait, another thought: perhaps A1 is a compound like FClO or something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe A1 is O2F2. Let me see: O2F2 is a tetramer of OF2, I think. But does O2F2 decompose into F2 and another compound? I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps when O2F2 decomposes, it forms O2 and F2. So A2 would be O2. But O2 is pure oxygen, so fluorine percentage is zero, which doesn't match 31.96%.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think about the other information given.

A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So A3 is the fluoride of Y. So YF_x.

When Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, concentrated solution of A4, A5 is obtained. A5 decomposes in water into two substances.

So perhaps A4 is a solution of a fluoride. For example, if Y is potassium (K), then A3 could be KF. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but let's think of Y as potassium. K forms several fluorides, like KF, but I'm not sure if there are five. Alternatively, perhaps Y is another element.

Wait, another approach: The decomposition of A5 in water gives two substances. If A5 is a fluorinated compound that breaks down into something like HF and another compound, perhaps a metal oxide or something else.

Alternatively, maybe A5 is a binary compound that hydrolyzes. For example, if A5 is something like ClF, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps A4 is a solution of a fluoride, like NaF. Then adding Y (maybe Na) in 1:1 ratio could produce something else.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of YF4, and adding Y in 1:1 ratio produces YF2 or something else. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should try another approach. Let me consider the options for A4's molecular weight.

The options are:

A) 140-160

B) 220-240

C) 160-180

D) 110-130

So the question is to find the range in which the molecular weight of A4 falls.

If I can find what A4 is, I can find its molecular weight.

Wait, what is A4? Let me see the clues.

A4 is the starting material for producing A5 when Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, concentrated solution of A4.

In the reaction, Y reacts with A4 to form A5.

Then, A5 decomposes in water to give two substances.

Hmm. So perhaps A4 is a solution of a fluoride salt. For example, if A4 is NaF solution, and Y is Na. But no, because Y is the element, so adding Na in 1:1 ratio to NaF solution would perhaps precipitate something else.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of a metal fluoride, and adding the metal (Y) in 1:1 ratio produces a different fluoride.

Wait, perhaps A4 is a solution of a metal fluoride, and adding the metal Y (like Y is K, and A4 is KF solution) would not make sense because adding K to KF solution... Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of a higher-valent fluoride, and adding Y in 1:1 ratio produces a lower-valent compound.

Wait, another thought: Maybe A4 is a solution of YF3, and adding Y produces YF. For example, if Y is Al, then AlF3 plus Al might produce AlF. But I'm not sure if that reaction is feasible.

Wait, but AlF3 is a compound, but adding Al metal to it might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of YF4, and adding Y in 1:1 ratio produces YF2. But I'm not certain about the reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of YF5, and adding Y in 1:1 produces YF3. But again, not sure.

Wait, but let's think about the decomposition of A5 in water. Suppose A5 is a binary compound that, when water is added, produces HF and another compound. For example, if A5 is YF, then adding water could produce Y(OH)F and HF.

Alternatively, if A5 is YF3, perhaps it decomposes into Y(OH)3 and HF.

But I'm not sure. Let me think of another angle.

Wait, let's go back to A1's decomposition. A1 decomposes into A2 and F2. So A1 → A2 + F2.

If A1 is a binary compound, let's say it's YF_x. Then, upon decomposition, it produces A2, which is another fluoride, perhaps YF_y, and F2.

Wait, for example, suppose Y is Cl. Then A1 could be ClF3. Decomposition would be 2 ClF3 → Cl2 + 3 F2. But in that case, A2 would be Cl2, which is pure chlorine, not a fluoride, so that doesn't fit the fluorine percentage. Because A2 is Cl2, the fluorine percentage is zero, which doesn't match the 31.96% given. So that can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps Y is another element.

Wait, another approach: Let's think of Y as sulfur. Sulfur forms several fluorides, like SF4, SF6, etc. So maybe there are five binary fluorides, as the problem states.

So Y is S. Then, A3 would be SF_x, obtained by fluorination of S.

But let's see. A1 is a compound of S and F that decomposes into A2 and F2. So maybe A1 is S2F10 or something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A1 is SF6. SF6 is a stable gas, but does it decompose? I think SF6 is quite stable, but under certain conditions, perhaps it can decompose into S and F2. Let me think: 2 SF6 → 2 S + 6 F2. But if that's the case, then A2 would be S (which is pure sulfur, so fluorine percentage is zero—doesn't match 31.96%).

Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe Y isn't sulfur.

Wait, perhaps Y is phosphorus. P forms PF3, PF5, etc. So maybe five binary fluorides. Let's see.

If A1 is PF5, upon decomposition, perhaps it forms P and F2: 4 PF5 → P4 + 10 F2. But then A2 is P4, which is elemental phosphorus, so fluorine percentage is zero. Again, not matching.

Hmm, this is getting tricky. Let me think of another approach.

Wait, another angle: the fluorine percentage in A2 is 31.96%. Let me calculate what that could be.

So, for a compound YF, fluorine is 19/(Y+19) = 0.3196 → Y ≈ 41 g/mol. As I thought earlier, but that's not a common element. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is YF3. Let's try YF3.

Fluorine mass is 3 *19=57. So 57/(Y +57)=0.3196 → Y +57 ≈57/0.3196 ≈178 → Y ≈ 121. Hmm, that's close to iodine (I is about 127). So Y could be iodine? Let's see.

If Y is iodine, then YF would be IF, YF3 is IF3, etc. But does iodine form five binary fluorides? I'm not sure. I know that I can form IF, IF3, IF5, and maybe others, but I'm not certain if that's five.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is another element with a higher atomic mass. Wait, 121 is around the atomic mass of Te (tellurium is about 128). So maybe Y is Te.

Wait, Te forms several fluorides. For example, TeF4, TeF6, etc. So maybe Y is Te.

If Y is Te, then YF would be TeF. Let's compute the fluorine percentage for YF (TeF). Te has an atomic mass of about 128. So fluorine is 19/(128 +19) =19/147 ≈12.92%. Not matching 31.96%.

If the formula is YF3 (TeF3), then fluorine mass is 3*19=57. So (57)/(128+57)=57/185≈30.8%. Close to 31.96%, but not exact. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is YF5 (TeF5). So fluorine mass is 5*19=95. 95/(128+95)=95/223≈42.5%. Higher than 31.96%, so not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is YF4 (TeF4). Then fluorine mass is 4*19=76. 76/(128+76) =76/204≈37.2%. Still higher than 31.96%.

Hmm, perhaps Y is not Te. Let me think of another possibility.

Wait, what if Y is bromine (Br)? Br's atomic mass is about 80.

If A2 is BrF, then fluorine percentage is 19/(80+19)=19/99≈19.19%. Not matching.

If A2 is BrF3, then fluorine is 3*19=57. 57/(80+57)=57/137≈41.6%. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps Y is another element. Let me think of Y as iodine (I, ~127 g/mol). Let's see.

If A2 is IF3, then fluorine is 57/(127+57)=57/184≈31%. Close to 31.96%. Hmm, that's very close.

So perhaps Y is iodine. Let me check: if Y is I, then A2 is IF3. So YF3 would be IF3.

In that case, the fluorine percentage would be 57/(127+57)=57/184≈31.0%. Which is close to 31.96%. Maybe it's a rounding issue. So that could fit.

If Y is I, then A1 is a binary compound of I and F. Perhaps I2F5 or another compound.

Wait, but let me think again about A1. A1 is a bright red substance that decomposes into A2 (IF3) and F2. So the decomposition reaction would be something like A1 → IF3 + F2.

Wait, but I'm not sure what binary compound of I and F would decompose to IF3 and F2. Alternatively, perhaps A1 is IF5, which upon decomposition could produce IF3 and F2.

Wait, let's think about the decomposition of IF5. IF5 is a compound that can decompose into IF3 and F2. Let me write the equation: 2 IF5 → 2 IF3 + F2. That makes sense.

So A1 would be IF5, which is a binary compound of I and F. When it decomposes, it produces IF3 (A2) and F2.

Now, the fluorine percentage in A2 is 31.96%: as calculated earlier, for IF3, it's about 31%. Close enough, perhaps considering rounding.

So if Y is I, then A3 is obtained by fluorinating I. So A3 would be IF, IF3, IF5, etc. But A3 can also interact with xenon, which is interesting.

Wait, but the problem says that A3 can also interact with xenon. Xenon can form compounds with fluorine, like XeF2, XeF4, XeF6. So perhaps A3 is a fluoride that can react with Xe, maybe acting as a oxidizing agent.

But perhaps that's a side note. Let's move on.

When Y (I) is added in 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, concentrated solution of A4, A5 is obtained. So, perhaps A4 is a solution of a iodide, like KI. But adding I (Y) to KI solution might not do much. Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of a higher-valent iodide, like I2F7 or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of a iodine fluoride, and adding I in 1:1 ratio produces another iodine fluoride.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about what A5 is. A5 decomposes in water into two substances. Suppose A5 is IF, which in water would hydrolyze to produce HF and I2O (iodine oxyacid?), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps A5 is a binary compound that upon hydrolysis gives HF and another compound, like HIO3 or something else.

But let me think about the molecular weight of A4. If Y is I, then A4 is probably a solution of a iodide, perhaps a higher fluoride. Let's say A4 is a solution of IF5. The molecular weight of IF5 would be I (127) +5*19=127+95=222 g/mol. So that would fall into option B (220-240).

Wait, but let me check the problem statement again. The question is about the molecular weight range of A4. So if A4 is a solution of something like IF5, which has a molecular weight of 222, then the answer would be option B.

But I'm not entirely sure if A4 is IF5. Let me think again.

Wait, when Y (I) is added to a hot concentrated solution of A4, A5 is formed. If A4 is something like KIO3 (a solution of an iodate), then adding I (metallic) might cause a redox reaction. For example, in acidic conditions, KIO3 could react with I to produce I2 and KIO4, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of a lower-valent iodide, and adding I would change it.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of HI (hydroiodic acid), but that's a gas, not a solution of a binary compound.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's sum up:

If Y is I, then A4 could be a solution of IF5. The molecular weight of IF5 is 127 + (5×19) = 127 +95=222 g/mol, which falls into option B (220-240). So the answer would be option B.

Wait, but let me check the other possibilities. Suppose A4 is a solution of another compound. For example, if Y is another element, like Br. Let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is Cl. Let me check that.

If Y is Cl, then for A2, the fluorine percentage would be 31.96%, so if A2 is ClF (assuming formula ClF), then (19)/(35.5+19)=19/54.5≈34.8%, which is higher than 31.96%. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps A2 is ClF3. Then, fluorine percentage is (3×19)/(35.5 +3×19)=57/(35.5+57)=57/92.5≈61.6%. No, that's way higher.

So perhaps Y is not Cl.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is another element. Let's think of Y as oxygen. Then, A2 could be OF2. Let's compute the fluorine percentage: (2×19)/(16 + 2×19) =38/(16+38)=38/54≈69.8%. No, that's higher than 31.96%.

Hmm. So perhaps Y is iodine, and A4 is IF5, giving molecular weight around 222, which is option B.

So the answer would be option B: 220-240.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the molecular weight range of substance A4, given the properties of the binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. Here's the analysis:

1. **A1 Decomposition**: A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K into A2 and fluorine (F₂). The fluorine percentage in A2 is 31.96%. This suggests that A2 is a binary compound of Y and F. Calculations indicate that if A2 is YF₃, the fluorine percentage is approximately 31.96%, which matches the given data. Thus, Y is likely iodine (I), as iodine forms compounds like IF₃, IF₅, etc.

2. **A1 as IF₅**: A1 could be IF₅, a binary compound of iodine and fluorine. Upon decomposition, IF₅ can produce IF₃ and F₂. This aligns with the decomposition reaction:  
   \[
   2 \, \text{IF₅} \rightarrow 2 \, \text{IF₃} + \text{F₂}.
   \]

3. **A3 and A4**: A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y (iodine), which could be a compound like IF₃ or IF₅. A4 is a solution of a binary compound of Y and F. When Y (iodine) is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, concentrated solution of A4, A5 is formed. A5 decomposes in water into two substances, likely HF and another compound.

4. **Molecular Weight of A4**: If A4 is a solution of IF₅, its molecular weight is calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{Molecular weight of IF₅} = 127 \, (\text{I}) + 5 \times 19 \, (\text{F}) = 222 \, \text{g/mol}.
   \]  
   This falls within the range of 220–240.

5. **Conclusion**: Based on the properties of A1, A2, and A4, and the calculations, the molecular weight of A4 is in the range of 220–240.

**Answer: B**
