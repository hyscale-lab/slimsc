Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and where it's located in the qubit space. Hmm, density matrices describe the state of a quantum system, including both pure and mixed states. 

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, I remember that |0⟩⟨0| is a projector that takes any state to the state |0⟩ and gives 1 when the input is |0⟩. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| is for |1⟩. So adding them together and multiplying by 1/2... Oh wait, that's the maximally mixed state for a qubit. Because when you add the projectors for both states and divide by two, it's like saying the qubit is in a 50-50 mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubits space. I think this has to do with the Bloch sphere representation. Right, the Bloch sphere is a geometric way to represent qubit states. For a pure state |ψ⟩, it's a point on the surface of the sphere, while mixed states are inside.

The general form of a density matrix for a single qubit is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ represents the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector (rx, ry, rz) that determines the state's position on the Bloch sphere. So if ρ is in the form (I + r·σ)/2, then r tells us where it is.

Looking at our given ρ: ρ = (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me compute that. Expanding |0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I. So ρ = (I)/2.

Wait, so ρ = (I + 0·σ)/2. Because the identity matrix is (I), so the r vector must be (0,0,0). Because when r is zero, the density matrix is (I)/2, which is the maximally mixed state. So the point on the Bloch sphere would be at the origin, right in the center.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the correct answer should be C.

Wait, but I thought that the maximally mixed state doesn't lie on the surface. Oh right, when the state is completely mixed, it's in the center of the Bloch sphere. Because any pure state (like |0⟩ or |1⟩) would have r with a magnitude of 1, but this state is completely mixed, so r is zero.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. To determine its geometrical position in the qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For a single qubit, the general form of a density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) is a vector that determines the position of the state on the Bloch sphere. Comparing this with the given density matrix, we note that:

1. The identity matrix \( I \) corresponds to the term \( \frac{I}{2} \), which implies \( \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0 \).
2. This means the vector \( \mathbf{r} \) is zero, i.e., \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \).

The maximally mixed state is represented by the origin in the Bloch sphere, as it is an equal mixture of the computational basis states \( |0\rangle \) and \( |1\rangle \). Among the options provided, the correct geometrical position is \( r = (0, 0, 0) \).
