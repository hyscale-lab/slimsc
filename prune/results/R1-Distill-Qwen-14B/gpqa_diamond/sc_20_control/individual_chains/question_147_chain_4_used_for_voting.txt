Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation processes, and I'm a bit new to this. Let me try to work through it step by step. So the problem is:

p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻

The antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of A is given as m_A c² = 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A. The options are A) 0.77c, B) 0.96c, C) 0.91c, D) 0.86c.

Hmm, first, I remember that in particle physics, annihilation involves matter and antimatter particles annihilating each other, typically producing other particles. But here, the process is a proton and antiproton annihilating into two A+ and two A- particles.

Wait, protons are baryons, and their annihilation with antiprotons usually produces mesons, but maybe in this case, it produces these A particles. But perhaps that's not too important for the calculation.

The key here is probably energy and momentum conservation. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe I can assume that the initial momentum is not too high, but I'm not sure yet.

Wait, the problem says the antiproton is "slowly moving". So perhaps its kinetic energy is small compared to its rest mass energy. But wait, the proton has a rest mass of about 938 MeV/c², so its rest energy is about 938 MeV. If the antiproton is moving slowly, its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass, so maybe the total energy is approximately 2 times the proton rest mass. Or wait, the proton and antiproton each have the same rest mass. So their combined rest mass energy would be 2 * 938 MeV = 1876 MeV.

But the products are four particles: two A+ and two A-. Each A has a rest mass of 300 MeV. So each A has rest energy 300 MeV, so four of them would be 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV. That's less than the initial rest mass energy of the proton and antiproton (1876 MeV), so there's some kinetic energy left over.

Wait, but wait—the initial situation also involves the antiproton moving slowly, so perhaps the system's initial momentum isn't zero. Because the antiproton is moving, the proton is probably moving as well, but in the opposite direction. Or wait, no—if the antiproton is moving in one direction, the initial proton is at rest? Or are they moving towards each other?

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the setup. The question says the antiproton is slowly moving. So perhaps the initial proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving towards it. Alternatively, maybe it's the other way around. Hmm, perhaps it's better to model this in the center-of-momentum frame.

Wait, but if the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the initial total momentum is that of the moving antiproton. Because if the proton is at rest, then the system's initial momentum would be the momentum of the antiproton.

Wait, but if the antiproton is moving slowly, its momentum p is much less than its rest mass times c. So p ≈ gamma m v ≈ (since v is small, gamma is approximately 1, so p ≈ m v). So maybe the initial momentum is not too big.

But perhaps, since the problem is about the velocity of the A particles, we can assume that all the A particles are moving with the same velocity, which would be the case if the system is symmetric and all the A particles share the same velocity in the center-of-momentum frame.

Wait, but the initial system is a proton and an antiproton. Let me think: the initial total energy is the sum of their energies, and the initial momentum is the momentum of the antiproton (assuming the proton is at rest). Let me model it that way for now.

So, the initial setup: proton is at rest, so its energy is m_p c². The antiproton is moving with velocity v, so its energy is gamma m_p c², and its momentum is gamma m_p v. So the total initial energy is (1 + gamma) m_p c², and the total momentum is gamma m_p v.

The products are four A particles. Each has rest mass m_A c² = 300 MeV. Let me consider them as a system. The four A particles must have a total energy equal to the initial energy, and their total momentum must equal the initial momentum.

But since the problem is symmetric, perhaps the four A particles are moving in two pairs in opposite directions, each pair having the same velocity. Alternatively, maybe all four are moving in the same direction, but that would complicate things.

Wait, but perhaps the A particles are moving in a symmetric way, such that the total momentum is along the same direction as the initial momentum.

Alternatively, maybe the A particles are moving in such a way that the total momentum is in the same direction as the initial system's momentum. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is symmetric, and all the A particles are moving in the same direction with the same velocity. But that would make their momenta all add up in the same direction, which may not be the case.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to model this in the center-of-momentum frame. Because in that frame, the total initial momentum is zero, which would make the problem symmetric. Then, the A particles would have to be emitted symmetrically, perhaps moving in opposite directions.

Wait, but the initial momentum isn't zero because the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving. So perhaps the initial total momentum is that of the antiproton. So the initial total energy is E_initial = E_p + E_pbar.

E_p is m_p c^2, since it's at rest.

E_pbar is gamma m_p c^2.

So, E_initial = (1 + gamma) m_p c^2.

The initial momentum is p_initial = gamma m_p v.

Now, the products are four A particles. Since the number of particles changes, perhaps the conservation laws are a bit tricky.

But let's think about the conservation of energy and momentum.

Total energy after collision: sum of energies of all four A particles.

Total momentum after collision: sum of their momenta.

But assuming that the A particles are moving in such a way that their momenta add up to the initial momentum, this could get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps all four A particles are moving in the same direction as the initial momentum, each with momentum p_A. But that would make four times p_A equal to the initial momentum. But that might not be the case; perhaps they're moving in different directions, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the system's total momentum is carried by the A particles in a way that their vector sum equals the initial momentum. But perhaps it's easier to make an assumption that all A particles move with the same velocity, so their momenta add up simply.

Wait, but four particles moving in the same direction would have a total momentum of 4 gamma_A m_A v_A, where gamma_A is the Lorentz factor for each A particle, and v_A is their velocity.

But wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I can approach this by considering the energy and momentum conservation in the lab frame. Let's assume that the initial proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with velocity v_pbar, which is small.

So, the initial energy is E_initial = m_p c^2 + gamma_pbar m_p c^2.

The initial momentum is p_initial = gamma_pbar m_p v_pbar.

After the collision, the four A particles are moving, each with energy E_A and momentum p_A. But since they're identical, perhaps they all have the same speed, so same gamma and momentum.

Wait, but four particles moving in the same direction would have a total momentum 4 p_A. But perhaps that's not correct, because in reality, the A particles might be moving in different directions, but given the symmetry, perhaps two are moving in one direction and two in the opposite, balancing each other.

Wait, but that's possible. Let me think: if two A+ are moving in one direction and two A- in the opposite, then their momenta could cancel each other out in that axis. But that would imply zero net momentum, which contradicts the initial momentum of the system.

Hmm, perhaps that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps all four are moving in the same direction as the initial momentum. Then their total momentum would be 4 p_A.

But let me try to write down the equations.

Energy conservation:

E_initial = sum of E_A for each A particle. So, 4 E_A = (1 + gamma_pbar) m_p c^2.

Momentum conservation:

p_initial = sum of p_A for each A particle. So, 4 p_A = gamma_pbar m_p v_pbar.

Each A particle has energy E_A = gamma_A m_A c^2, where gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - v_A²/c²).

Each A particle's momentum is p_A = gamma_A m_A v_A.

Now, since the antiproton is moving slowly, v_pbar is much less than c, so gamma_pbar is approximately 1 + (v_pbar²)/(2 c^2), but since v_pbar is small, gamma_pbar ≈ 1.

Wait, but wait! The problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, so v_pbar is much less than c, so gamma_pbar is approximately 1 + (v_pbar²)/(2c²), but since v_pbar is small, we can approximate gamma_pbar ≈ 1 + (v_pbar²)/(2c²). But perhaps for the sake of calculation, we can take gamma_pbar = 1 + (v_pbar²)/(2 c²), but given that v_pbar is small, maybe it's better to model gamma_pbar as approximately 1.

Wait, but if the antiproton is moving slowly, its kinetic energy is small, so the total energy of the system is approximately 2 m_p c^2, but the rest mass energy is 2 m_p c^2, but the products have rest mass energy 4 m_A c^2 = 1200 MeV, which is less than 2 * 938 MeV (which is about 1876 MeV). So the products have less rest mass than the initial, meaning there's kinetic energy left.

But maybe it's better to proceed with the equations.

So let's proceed:

From momentum conservation:

4 gamma_A m_A v_A = gamma_pbar m_p v_pbar.

From energy conservation:

4 gamma_A m_A c² = (1 + gamma_pbar) m_p c².

We can divide the momentum equation by the energy equation to eliminate gamma_A m_A.

(4 gamma_A m_A v_A) / (4 gamma_A m_A c²) ) = (gamma_pbar m_p v_pbar) / ( (1 + gamma_pbar) m_p c² )

Simplify:

v_A / c² = ( gamma_pbar v_pbar ) / ( (1 + gamma_pbar) c² )

Wait, no. Let's compute the ratio.

Momentum equation: 4 gamma_A m_A v_A = gamma_pbar m_p v_pbar.

Energy equation: 4 gamma_A m_A c² = (1 + gamma_pbar) m_p c².

Dividing momentum equation by energy equation gives:

(4 gamma_A m_A v_A) / (4 gamma_A m_A c² ) ) = (gamma_pbar m_p v_pbar) / ( (1 + gamma_pbar) m_p c² )

Simplify left side: v_A/(c²).

Right side: (gamma_pbar v_pbar) / ( (1 + gamma_pbar) c² )

So:

v_A / c² = (gamma_pbar v_pbar) / ( (1 + gamma_pbar) c² )

Multiply both sides by c²:

v_A = (gamma_pbar v_pbar) / (1 + gamma_pbar )

Hmm, interesting.

But since the antiproton is moving slowly, v_pbar << c. So gamma_pbar ≈ 1 + (v_pbar²)/(2 c²), but for small v_pbar, gamma_pbar ≈ 1 + (v_pbar²)/(2 c²) ≈ 1.

So let's approximate gamma_pbar ≈ 1 + (v_pbar²)/(2 c²), but since v_pbar is small, this is approximately 1.

Wait, but perhaps we can consider that gamma_pbar is approximately 1, so the equation simplifies to:

v_A ≈ (v_pbar) / (1 + 1) ) = v_pbar / 2.

But that would imply v_A is much smaller, but the options are all close to c, so perhaps this approach is not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption that the antiproton is moving slowly leads to a different scenario.

Wait a minute, perhaps I got the setup wrong. Maybe the proton is moving and the antiproton is at rest. But the question says the antiproton is slowly moving, so perhaps the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly towards it.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is symmetric, and we can consider the center-of-momentum frame. Because in the center-of-momentum frame, the total initial momentum is zero. So in that frame, the A particles must also have zero total momentum. So their momenta must cancel each other out.

Wait, but the problem is that the proton and antiproton are annihilating into four A particles. So in the COM frame, after the annihilation, the total momentum of the four A particles must be zero.

So perhaps in this frame, the A particles are emitted in pairs moving in opposite directions, each pair having equal and opposite momenta.

But let's think about that. Suppose two A particles are moving in one direction with momentum p, and the other two in the opposite direction with momentum p. Then the total momentum would be zero, as (p - p) = 0. So that works.

In this case, each A would have the same magnitude of momentum but opposite directions, so their contributions cancel.

So in the COM frame, each A has energy E_A = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_A c^2)^2 ) / c².

Wait, but in the COM frame, the energies would all be the same. Because each A has the same rest mass and same momentum magnitude.

So, the total energy in the COM frame is 4 E_A.

But the initial energy in the COM frame is simply the sum of the rest energies of the proton and antiproton, because in the COM frame, their momenta are equal and opposite, so their total momentum is zero. So the initial energy in the COM frame is 2 m_p c^2.

So in the COM frame:

Total energy after annihilation: 4 E_A = 2 m_p c^2.

Thus, E_A = (2 m_p c^2) / 4 = (m_p c^2)/2.

But E_A is the energy of each A particle, so:

E_A = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_A c^2)^2 ) / c^2.

Wait, no, E_A is in units of MeV, so E_A = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_A c^2)^2 ) / c²? Wait, no, the units are a bit confusing. Let me represent it correctly.

E_A = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_A c^2)^2 ) / c^2? No. Sorry, let's correct that.

E_A is the total energy of the A particle, which is in units of MeV. So:

E_A = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_A c^2)^2 ) / c^2 [No, that's not correct.]

Wait, no, the formula is E = sqrt( (p c )^2 + (m c^2 )^2 ) where E is in units of energy (e.g., MeV), p is in units of MeV/c, m is in units of MeV/c², and c is in m/s, but the units work out when you plug in the numbers correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should just write E_A = sqrt( (p)^2 c^2 + (m_A c^2)^2 ).

So, since E_A = (m_p c^2)/2, we can write:

(m_p c^2)/2 = sqrt( p^2 c^2 + m_A^2 c^4 )

Square both sides:

(m_p^2 c^4 ) /4 = p^2 c^2 + m_A^2 c^4.

Subtract m_A^2 c^4 from both sides:

(m_p^2 c^4 )/4 - m_A^2 c^4 = p^2 c^2.

Factor out c^4:

c^2 (m_p^2 /4 - m_A^2 ) = p^2 c^2.

Divide both sides by c^2:

m_p^2/4 - m_A^2 = p^2.

So p = sqrt( m_p^2/4 - m_A^2 ) .

But let's plug in the numbers. m_p c^2 is about 938 MeV. So m_p = 938 MeV/c².

m_A c^2 is given as 300 MeV. So m_A = 300 MeV/c².

So,

p^2 = ( (938^2 ) /4 ) - (300)^2 ) (MeV²/c²) )

Calculate that:

938^2 is approximately 880,000 (exactly, 938 *938 = let me compute it: 900^2=810000, 38^2=1444, 2*900*38=68400. So 810000 +68400 +1444 = 879844.

So (879844)/4 = 219,961 MeV².

300^2 = 90,000 MeV².

So p^2 = 219961 - 90000 = 129,961 MeV²/c².

So p = sqrt(129961) MeV/c.

What's sqrt(129961)? Let's compute it.

Well, 360^2 = 129600. 360^2 = 129600.

360^2 = 129600, so 360^2 + 361 = 129961.

Wait, 360^2 = (3.6e2)^2 = 12.96e4 = 129600.

360^2 = 129600.

360.5^2 = (360 + 0.5)^2 = 360² + 2*360*.5 + 0.25 = 129600 + 360 + 0.25 = 129960.25.

Hmm, so sqrt(129961) is approximately 360.5 (since 360.5^2 is 129960.25, which is just under 129961). So sqrt(129961) is approximately 360.5 MeV/c.

So p ≈ 360.5 MeV/c.

Now, the momentum p of each A is 360.5 MeV/c, and the energy E_A is (938 MeV)/2 = 469 MeV.

Now, the velocity v_A can be found from the relation between momentum and energy.

We know that for a particle,

E^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2.

So, beta (v/c) can be found from:

beta = (p c) / (E c^2) ) * c → beta = (p c) / (E c^2) ) * c ?

Wait, better to compute beta as v/c = (pc^2)/(E c^2) ) / c? Hmm, perhaps it's better to use the formula:

beta = (p c) / E.

Wait, because E = gamma m c², and p = gamma m v.

So, p c = gamma m v c.

E = gamma m c².

So,

beta = v/c = (p c) / (gamma m c²) ) = (p c) / (E).

So,

beta = (p c) / E.

Wait, but p is in MeV/c, and E is in MeV.

Wait, plugging in the numbers:

p c = (360.5 MeV/c) * c = 360.5 MeV.

E = 469 MeV.

So,

beta = 360.5 / 469 ≈ 0.767.

So v_A ≈ 0.767 c.

Hmm, looking at the options, option A is 0.77c. That's close.

But wait, I'm working in the center-of-momentum frame. The problem, however, may be asking for the velocity in the lab frame where the antiproton is moving slowly. Oh, this is a crucial point. Because earlier, I considered the COM frame, but perhaps the problem is asking for the velocity in the lab frame.

Wait, the question's setup says the antiproton is slowly moving. So perhaps the lab frame is the rest frame of the proton, and the antiproton is moving towards it with low velocity.

So the velocity of the A particles in the lab frame would be different from their velocity in the COM frame. So perhaps I need to perform a Lorentz transformation from the COM frame to the lab frame.

Wait, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that in the lab frame, the initial momentum is that of the antiproton.

Wait, let me recap. I calculated the velocity in the COM frame (where the total initial momentum is zero) as approximately 0.767c. But the question is about the velocity in the lab frame, where the antiproton is moving slowly.

Alternatively, perhaps the velocity in the lab frame is the same as in the COM frame, but that can't be right because the frames are moving relative to each other.

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering that all the A particles are moving at the same speed in the lab frame, but I'm not certain.

Hmm, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's consider the problem in the lab frame where the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with velocity v_pbar.

In this frame, the initial energy is E_initial = m_p c² + gamma_pbar m_p c².

The initial momentum is p_initial = gamma_pbar m_p v_pbar.

The four A particles must have a total energy equal to E_initial and a total momentum equal to p_initial.

Assuming all A particles have the same velocity, v_A, and same gamma_A. So their total momentum is 4 gamma_A m_A v_A, and their total energy is 4 gamma_A m_A c².

So, setting up the equations:

4 gamma_A m_A c² = (1 + gamma_pbar) m_p c². (Energy conservation)

4 gamma_A m_A v_A = gamma_pbar m_p v_pbar. (Momentum conservation)

Hmm, so from the second equation, divide by the first equation:

(4 gamma_A m_A v_A) / (4 gamma_A m_A c²) ) = (gamma_pbar m_p v_pbar) / ( (1 + gamma_pbar) m_p c² )

Simplify:

v_A / c² = (gamma_pbar v_pbar) / ( (1 + gamma_pbar) c² )

Cancel c²:

v_A = (gamma_pbar v_pbar) / (1 + gamma_pbar )

Hmm, but since the antiproton is moving slowly, v_pbar << c, so gamma_pbar ≈ 1 + (v_pbar²)/(2 c²) ≈ 1.

So, v_A ≈ (v_pbar) / (2 )

But this leads to a much lower velocity, which doesn't match any of the options given. So perhaps this approach is missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the assumption that all four A particles have the same velocity is incorrect. Maybe two are moving in one direction and two in the opposite, leading to a net momentum. But that complicates things.

Wait, but let me think about the COM frame. In the COM frame, the velocity of each A is approximately 0.767c, as calculated earlier. If the COM frame is moving at some velocity relative to the lab frame, then the velocity of the A particles in the lab frame would be different.

To find the velocity in the lab frame, we can use the velocity transformation formula from the COM frame to the lab frame.

In the lab frame, the initial system has the proton at rest and the antiproton moving with velocity v_pbar. The COM frame is moving at velocity u relative to the lab frame. The velocity u can be found from the initial momenta.

Wait, the total initial momentum in the lab frame is p_initial = gamma_pbar m_p v_pbar.

The total energy is E_initial = m_p c² + gamma_pbar m_p c².

The velocity of the COM frame (u) relative to the lab frame is given by:

u = (p_initial c²) / E_initial

Because the velocity of the center of momentum frame (u) is given by (total momentum * c²) / (total energy).

So,

u = (gamma_pbar m_p v_pbar c²) / ( (1 + gamma_pbar) m_p c² )

Simplify:

u = (gamma_pbar v_pbar ) / (1 + gamma_pbar )

Again, since v_pbar is small, gamma_pbar ≈ 1, so u ≈ v_pbar / 2.

Hmm, but then the velocity of each A in the COM frame is v_A_COM ≈ 0.767c.

Now, we can apply the velocity addition formula to find the velocity of each A in the lab frame. Suppose the A particles are moving in the same direction as the COM frame's motion relative to the lab.

Wait, but perhaps the A particles in the COM frame are moving in a particular direction. Let me think: in the COM frame, their velocity is v_A_COM in some direction, which could be along the initial momentum direction.

Wait, but in the COM frame, the total initial momentum is zero, so the A particles' momenta must cancel each other out. So perhaps they're emitted symmetrically.

Wait, but earlier, I assumed that each A has the same velocity, which might not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the A particles are emitted in opposite directions, leading to their momenta canceling each other.

But perhaps in the COM frame, each A is moving with velocity v_A_COM, and the direction depends on the emission.

Alternatively, perhaps the A particles are moving in pairs in opposite directions, each with the same speed. So in the COM frame, the total momentum is zero because for every A moving in one direction, there's another moving in the opposite with the same speed.

But that complicates the calculation, because each A would have different velocities in the lab frame based on their direction.

But perhaps the simplest approach is to suppose that each A is moving with velocity v_A_COM in the opposite direction to the COM frame's motion relative to the lab.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to consider only one A particle and apply the velocity transformation.

But this is getting quite involved. Let me try to proceed.

In the COM frame, the A particles are moving with velocity v_A_COM ≈ 0.767c (approx 0.77c). Now, the COM frame is moving with velocity u relative to the lab frame. To find the velocity of the A particles in the lab frame, we can use the Lorentz velocity addition formula.

Assume that in the COM frame, the A is moving at velocity v_A_COM in the same direction as the COM is moving relative to the lab frame. Then, the velocity in the lab frame would be:

v_lab = (u + v_A_COM) / (1 + (u v_A_COM)/c² )

But I need to clarify the directions. If the COM frame is moving with velocity u in the same direction as the A particle's velocity in the COM frame, then the lab frame would see the A moving faster.

Alternatively, if the A is moving in the opposite direction in the COM frame, then the velocity in the lab would be:

v_lab = (u - v_A_COM) / (1 - (u v_A_COM)/c² )

But this is getting a bit too detailed, and perhaps I'm overcomplicating things. Maybe the initial approach, considering the COM frame, gives us the correct velocity of the A particles relative to the COM, which is about 0.77c, which is option A.

But earlier, the calculation in the COM frame gave v_A ≈ 0.767c, which is approximately 0.77c, matching option A.

But wait, the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly. So perhaps our initial assumption that the COM frame is where the total momentum is zero isn't the right approach. Or perhaps I made a mistake in considering the velocity in the COM frame as the velocity in the lab frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that the velocity of the A particles is determined by the threshold condition for the reaction to occur. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the minimum energy required for the reaction to occur is when the products are produced at rest in the COM frame. But in this case, the rest mass of the products is 4 m_A c^2 = 1200 MeV, while the initial rest mass is 2 m_p c^2 = 1876 MeV. So the reaction is possible since the initial rest mass is larger than the products' rest mass.

But since the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the kinetic energy is low, but the reaction still occurs.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the relativistic Breit-Wigner distribution, but that's probably beyond what I need to consider here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed such that the velocity of the A particles can be found using non-relativistic considerations, but the options suggest that the velocity is a significant fraction of c, so that's not the case.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is symmetric and each A particle carries away energy and momentum such that the velocity can be found using the energy and momentum conservation equations, leading to a specific value.

Wait, going back to the initial setup in the lab frame, perhaps I can use the following approach.

Let me denote the velocity of the antiproton as v_pbar, which is small.

So, the initial energy is E_initial = m_p c^2 + gamma_pbar m_p c^2.

The initial momentum is p_initial = gamma_pbar m_p v_pbar.

After the collision, the four A particles have a combined energy of 4 gamma_A m_A c^2 and combined momentum 4 gamma_A m_A v_A.

Setting up the equations:

4 gamma_A m_A c^2 = m_p c^2 + gamma_pbar m_p c^2. → equation (1)

4 gamma_A m_A v_A = gamma_pbar m_p v_pbar. → equation (2)

We can solve for gamma_A from equation (1):

gamma_A = [ (1 + gamma_pbar) m_p c^2 ] / (4 m_A c^2 )

= [ (1 + gamma_pbar) m_p ] / (4 m_A )

Now, from equation (2):

gamma_A m_A v_A = (gamma_pbar m_p v_pbar ) /4.

Wait, no, equation (2) is 4 gamma_A m_A v_A = gamma_pbar m_p v_pbar.

So,

gamma_A m_A v_A = (gamma_pbar m_p v_pbar ) /4.

Dividing equation (2) by equation (1):

[ gamma_A m_A v_A ] / [ gamma_A m_A c^2 ] ) = [ (gamma_pbar m_p v_pbar ) /4 ] / [ (1 + gamma_pbar ) m_p c^2 )

Simplify:

v_A / c² = [ (gamma_pbar v_pbar ) /4 (1 + gamma_pbar) ) ] * (1/c² )

Wait, perhaps I'm getting tangled up again. Let me try substituting gamma_A from equation (1) into equation (2).

From equation (1):

gamma_A = [ (1 + gamma_pbar) m_p ] / (4 m_A )

Substitute into equation (2):

4 * [ (1 + gamma_pbar) m_p / (4 m_A ) ] * m_A v_A = gamma_pbar m_p v_pbar.

Simplify:

[ (1 + gamma_pbar) m_p ] * v_A = gamma_pbar m_p v_pbar.

Cancel m_p from both sides:

(1 + gamma_pbar) v_A = gamma_pbar v_pbar.

So,

v_A = (gamma_pbar / (1 + gamma_pbar )) v_pbar.

But since the antiproton is moving slowly, v_pbar << c, so gamma_pbar ≈ 1 + (v_pbar^2)/(2 c^2 ) ≈ 1.

Thus,

v_A ≈ (1/(1+1 )) v_pbar = (1/2) v_pbar.

But this suggests that v_A is much smaller than c, which contradicts the options provided. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Hmm, maybe I made a wrong assumption. Perhaps the initial setup is that the proton and antiproton are moving towards each other with equal and opposite velocities, so their momenta cancel in the COM frame. But the problem states the antiproton is moving slowly, which might imply that the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving towards it with a small velocity.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the energy and momentum in the lab frame where the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with velocity v_pbar. Then, the initial momentum is gamma_pbar m_p v_pbar, and the initial energy is E_initial = m_p c^2 + gamma_pbar m_p c^2.

The four A particles, each with momentum p_A and energy E_A, must satisfy:

4 E_A = E_initial → E_A = [ (1 + gamma_pbar) m_p c^2 ] /4.

4 p_A = gamma_pbar m_p v_pbar → p_A = [ gamma_pbar m_p v_pbar ] /4.

Now, for each A particle,

E_A^2 = (p_A c )^2 + (m_A c^2 )^2.

Substituting E_A and p_A from above:

[ (1 + gamma_pbar) m_p c^2 /4 ]^2 = [ (gamma_pbar m_p v_pbar c ) /4 ]^2 + (m_A c^2 )^2.

Simplify:

( (1 + gamma_pbar)^2 m_p^2 c^4 ) / 16 = ( gamma_pbar^2 m_p^2 v_pbar^2 c^2 ) / 16 + m_A^2 c^4.

Multiply both sides by 16:

(1 + gamma_pbar)^2 m_p^2 c^4 = gamma_pbar^2 m_p^2 v_pbar^2 c^2 + 16 m_A^2 c^4.

Divide both sides by c^2:

(1 + gamma_pbar)^2 m_p^2 c^2 = gamma_pbar^2 m_p^2 v_pbar^2 + 16 m_A^2 c^2.

Hmm, this equation seems complex, but perhaps we can find a relation between v_pbar and other variables.

Wait, but since the antiproton is moving slowly, v_pbar is small, so gamma_pbar ≈ 1 + (v_pbar²)/(2 c^2 ), and v_pbar² is much less than c².

Let me approximate gamma_pbar ≈ 1 + (v_pbar²)/(2 c^2 ), and since v_pbar is small, I can expand the equation in terms of (v_pbar/c )^2.

But this might be getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can find an expression for v_A in terms of gamma_pbar and v_pbar, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps another approach is needed. Let's consider that the velocity v_A is determined by the energies and momenta, and because the problem gives the mass of A, perhaps we can find the velocity using the relation between the kinetic energy and momentum, but I'm not seeing it clearly.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the problem is designed such that all the kinetic energy goes into the kinetic energy of the A particles. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the velocity of the A is determined by the condition that the total momentum is carried by the A particles alone, given that the initial system has a certain momentum.

But given the time I've spent and the options provided, perhaps I should go back to the earlier calculation in the COM frame, where I found v_A ≈ 0.77c, which is option A.

But wait, the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly, implying that its gamma is approximately 1, so the initial energy is approximately 2 m_p c², which is about 1876 MeV.

The rest mass of the four A particles is 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV. So the remaining energy is 676 MeV, which goes into their kinetic energy.

Wait, but in the COM frame, each A has energy 469 MeV, which is larger than their rest mass, so they have kinetic energy.

But perhaps the velocity in the lab frame is higher than in the COM frame. Alternatively, the velocity in the COM frame is 0.77c, which would correspond to option A.

But considering all the confusion, I think the intended approach is to calculate the velocity in the COM frame, leading to option A) 0.77c.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the annihilation process:

**Process:**  
The annihilation involves a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\bar{p}$) annihilating to produce two $A^+$ and two $A^-$ particles:  
$$p + \bar{p} \rightarrow 2A^+ + 2A^-.$$

### Key Information:
1. The antiproton is moving slowly, implying its velocity $v_{\bar{p}} \ll c$, so $\gamma_{\bar{p}} \approx 1$.
2. The rest energy of $A$ is given as $m_A c^2 = 300 \, \text{MeV}$.
3. The proton and antiproton have rest energy $m_p c^2 = 938 \, \text{MeV}$.

### Conservation Laws:
- **Energy Conservation:**  
  The total energy before annihilation is the sum of the proton's rest energy and the antiproton's total energy:  
  $$E_{\text{initial}} = m_p c^2 + \gamma_{\bar{p}} m_p c^2.$$  
  After annihilation, the total energy is shared among the four $A$ particles:  
  $$E_{\text{initial}} = 4 E_A,$$  
  where $E_A$ is the energy of each $A$ particle.

- **Momentum Conservation:**  
  The total momentum before annihilation is the momentum of the antiproton (since the proton is assumed to be at rest):  
  $$p_{\text{initial}} = \gamma_{\bar{p}} m_p v_{\bar{p}}.$$  
  After annihilation, the total momentum is carried by the four $A$ particles. Assuming symmetry, the $A$ particles move in pairs with equal and opposite momenta, leaving the total momentum unchanged.

### Analysis:
1. **Energy Conservation in the COM Frame:**  
   In the center-of-momentum (COM) frame, the total initial momentum is zero. After annihilation, the $A$ particles must also have zero total momentum. This implies the $A$ particles are emitted symmetrically, with two moving in one direction and two in the opposite direction.

   The total energy in the COM frame is:  
   $$E_{\text{COM}} = 2 m_p c^2.$$  
   This energy is shared equally among the four $A$ particles:  
   $$4 E_A = 2 m_p c^2 \implies E_A = \frac{m_p c^2}{2} = \frac{938 \, \text{MeV}}{2} = 469 \, \text{MeV}.$$

2. **Relating Energy and Momentum for $A$:**  
   For each $A$ particle, the energy is related to its momentum and rest mass by:  
   $$E_A^2 = (p_A c)^2 + (m_A c^2)^2.$$  
   Substituting $E_A = 469 \, \text{MeV}$ and $m_A c^2 = 300 \, \text{MeV}$:  
   $$(469)^2 = (p_A c)^2 + (300)^2.$$  
   Solving for $p_A$:  
   $$p_A c = \sqrt{(469)^2 - (300)^2} = \sqrt{219, 841 - 90, 000} = \sqrt{129, 841} \approx 360.4 \, \text{MeV}.$$

3. **Velocity of $A$:**  
   The velocity $v_A$ is related to the momentum $p_A$ and energy $E_A$ by:  
   $$\beta_A = \frac{v_A}{c} = \frac{p_A c}{E_A}.$$  
   Substituting $p_A c = 360.4 \, \text{MeV}$ and $E_A = 469 \, \text{MeV}$:  
   $$\beta_A = \frac{360.4}{469} \approx 0.767.$$  
   Thus, $v_A \approx 0.767c$.

### Conclusion:
The velocity of each $A$ particle is approximately $0.77c$, which corresponds to **Option A**.
