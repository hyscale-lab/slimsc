Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. The reaction given is Pi(+) decaying into a mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The pion is stationary, so that probably means it's at rest when it decays.

The rest masses are given: the pion has a rest mass of 139.6 MeV, and the muon has 105.7 MeV. Wait, but neutrinos are tricky because they have almost no mass, right? So maybe I can approximate the neutrino's mass as zero for this calculation, but I'm not entirely sure. Hmm.

The options are A, B, C, D, each with two energies. I think each option gives the kinetic energy of the muon and the neutrino. But wait, the pion is at rest, so the total momentum before decay is zero. After decay, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. So their momenta should be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

But how do I find their kinetic energies? I remember that in such decay processes, the total energy is conserved, as well as momentum. Let me think about the conservation of energy and momentum here.

The initial total energy is just the rest energy of the pion because it's stationary. So that's 139.6 MeV. The final total energy must be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The muon's energy would be its rest mass plus its kinetic energy, and the neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy (since its rest mass is negligible).

Wait, but let me clarify: in particle physics, the energy of a particle is the sum of its rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So for the muon, E_mu = m_mu c² + K_mu. For the neutrino, E_nu = K_nu, since m_nu ≈ 0.

So the total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu = (m_mu c² + K_mu) + K_nu. But since the pion is at rest, the total energy before decay is just m_pi c². So:

m_pi c² = (m_mu c² + K_mu) + K_nu.

That's one equation. The other comes from conservation of momentum. The initial momentum is zero, so the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. So p_mu = -p_nu. Since momentum is a vector, their magnitudes are equal. So |p_mu| = |p_nu|.

Let me denote p as the magnitude of the muon's momentum. Then the neutrino's momentum is also p, but in the opposite direction.

Now, for each particle, the energy-momentum relation holds: E² = (pc)² + (m c²)².

So for the muon: (m_mu c² + K_mu)² = (p c)² + (m_mu c²)².

Expanding that: (m_mu² c^4 + 2 m_mu c² K_mu + K_mu²) = p² c² + m_mu² c^4.

Subtracting m_mu² c^4 from both sides:

2 m_mu c² K_mu + K_mu² = p² c².

Similarly, for the neutrino, since m_nu ≈ 0, E_nu² = (p c)^2. So E_nu = p c. But E_nu is K_nu in this case.

So K_nu = p c.

Hmm, but wait, the neutrino's energy is p c. So K_nu = p c.

Now, going back to the energy conservation equation:

m_pi c² = m_mu c² + K_mu + K_nu.

Substituting K_nu = p c, we get:

m_pi c² = m_mu c² + K_mu + p c.

But from the muon's equation, 2 m_mu c² K_mu + K_mu² = (p c)^2.

Let me try to express everything in terms of p and K_mu.

Wait, perhaps it's better to introduce variables. Let me let x = K_mu and y = K_nu.

Then from energy conservation:

139.6 = 105.7 + x + y.

So equation one: x + y = 33.9 MeV.

And from momentum considerations: y = p c.

From the muon's equation:

x² + 2 * 105.7 * x = (p c)^2.

But since y = p c, substitute into that equation:

x² + 2 * 105.7 * x = y².

But y = 33.9 - x, from equation one. So substituting:

x² + 2 * 105.7 * x = (33.9 - x)^2.

Let me expand the right side: (33.9 - x)^2 = 33.9^2 - 2*33.9 x + x².

So the equation becomes:

x² + 211.4 x = 1149.21 - 67.8 x + x².

Subtract x² from both sides:

211.4 x = 1149.21 - 67.8 x.

Combine like terms:

211.4 x + 67.8 x = 1149.21.

(211.4 + 67.8) x = 1149.21.

279.2 x = 1149.21.

x = 1149.21 / 279.2.

Let me compute that. 279.2 is approximately 279.2. Let me calculate 1149.21 divided by 279.2.

Hmm, 279.2 * 4 = 1116.8. 1149.21 - 1116.8 = 32.41. So 32.41 / 279.2 ≈ 0.116.

So x ≈ 4.116 MeV. So K_mu is approximately 4.12 MeV.

Then y = 33.9 - x = 33.9 -4.116 ≈ 29.784 MeV ≈ 29.8 MeV.

Looking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.

Wait, but let me double-check that calculation to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, 279.2 x = 1149.21.

So x = 1149.21 / 279.2.

Let me compute 279.2 * 4 = 1116.8.

Subtract from 1149.21: 1149.21 - 1116.8 = 32.41.

So 32.41 divided by 279.2 is approximately 0.116.

So 4.116, as before.

So yes, K_mu is approximately 4.12 MeV, and K_nu is 33.9 -4.12=29.78 MeV, which is approximately 29.8.

So in the options, D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So that should be the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the neutrino's kinetic energy is given as the higher value, but in the options, the first number is the muon's KE, and the second the neutrino's. So yes, D is the correct option.

To solve the problem, we analyze the decay process:

The pion (Pi⁺) is stationary and decays into a muon (mu⁺) and a neutrino (nu). The rest masses are given as:

- Rest mass of Pi⁺: \( m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Rest mass of mu⁺: \( m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \)

The neutrino's rest mass is negligible (\( m_{\nu} \approx 0 \)).

### Conservation of Energy and Momentum
1. **Energy Conservation**:  
   The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the pion:  
   \[
   E_{\text{total}} = m_{\pi} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]  
   After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino:  
   \[
   E_{\text{total}} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu}.
   \]  
   The muon's energy is \( E_{\mu} = m_{\mu} c^2 + K_{\mu} \), where \( K_{\mu} \) is its kinetic energy. The neutrino's energy is \( E_{\nu} = K_{\nu} \), since its rest mass is negligible. Thus:  
   \[
   m_{\pi} c^2 = m_{\mu} c^2 + K_{\mu} + K_{\nu}.
   \]  
   Substituting values:  
   \[
   139.6 = 105.7 + K_{\mu} + K_{\nu}.
   \]  
   Simplifying:  
   \[
   K_{\mu} + K_{\nu} = 33.9 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. **Momentum Conservation**:  
   Since the pion is stationary, the total momentum before decay is zero. After decay, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum:  
   \[
   p_{\mu} = p_{\nu}.
   \]  

3. **Energy-Momentum Relation**:  
   For the muon:  
   \[
   E_{\mu}^2 = (p_{\mu} c)^2 + (m_{\mu} c^2)^2.
   \]  
   Substituting \( E_{\mu} = m_{\mu} c^2 + K_{\mu} \):  
   \[
   (m_{\mu} c^2 + K_{\mu})^2 = (p_{\mu} c)^2 + (m_{\mu} c^2)^2.
   \]  
   Expanding and simplifying:  
   \[
   2 m_{\mu} c^2 K_{\mu} + K_{\mu}^2 = (p_{\mu} c)^2.
   \]  
   For the neutrino:  
   \[
   E_{\nu}^2 = (p_{\nu} c)^2.
   \]  
   Since \( E_{\nu} = K_{\nu} \):  
   \[
   K_{\nu}^2 = (p_{\nu} c)^2.
   \]  

4. **Solving for \( K_{\mu} \) and \( K_{\nu} \)**:  
   From momentum conservation, \( p_{\mu} = p_{\nu} \), so \( K_{\nu} = p_{\nu} c \). Substituting into the energy conservation equation:  
   \[
   K_{\mu} + K_{\nu} = 33.9.
   \]  
   Using the muon's energy-momentum relation:  
   \[
   2 m_{\mu} c^2 K_{\mu} + K_{\mu}^2 = K_{\nu}^2.
   \]  
   Substituting \( K_{\nu} = 33.9 - K_{\mu} \):  
   \[
   2 m_{\mu} c^2 K_{\mu} + K_{\mu}^2 = (33.9 - K_{\mu})^2.
   \]  
   Expanding and simplifying:  
   \[
   211.4 K_{\mu} + K_{\mu}^2 = 1149.21 - 67.8 K_{\mu} + K_{\mu}^2.
   \]  
   Canceling \( K_{\mu}^2 \):  
   \[
   211.4 K_{\mu} + 67.8 K_{\mu} = 1149.21.
   \]  
   \[
   279.2 K_{\mu} = 1149.21.
   \]  
   Solving for \( K_{\mu} \):  
   \[
   K_{\mu} = \frac{1149.21}{279.2} \approx 4.12 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]  
   Substituting \( K_{\mu} = 4.12 \, \text{MeV} \) into \( K_{\mu} + K_{\nu} = 33.9 \):  
   \[
   K_{\nu} = 33.9 - 4.12 = 29.8 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energy of the muon is \( 4.12 \, \text{MeV} \), and the kinetic energy of the neutrino is \( 29.8 \, \text{MeV} \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. The reaction given is Pi(+) decaying into a mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The pion is stationary, so that probably means it's at rest when it decays.

The options are A, B, C, D, each with two energies. I think each option gives the kinetic energy of the muon and the neutrino. But wait, the pion is at rest, so the total momentum before decay is zero. After decay, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. So their momenta should be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

But how do I find their kinetic energies? I remember that in such decay processes, the total energy is conserved, as well as momentum. Let me think about the conservation of energy and momentum here.

The initial total energy is just the rest energy of the pion because it's stationary. So that's 139.6 MeV. The final total energy must be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The muon's energy would be its rest mass plus its kinetic energy, and the neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy (since its rest mass is negligible).

Wait, but let me clarify: in particle physics, the energy of a particle is the sum of its rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So for the muon, E_mu = m_mu c² + K_mu. For the neutrino, E_nu = K_nu, since m_nu ≈ 0.

So the total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu = (m_mu c² + K_mu) + K_nu. But since the pion is at rest, the total energy before decay is just m_pi c². So:

m_pi c² = (m_mu c² + K_mu) + K_nu.

That's one equation. The other comes from conservation of momentum. The initial momentum is zero, so the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. So p_mu = -p_nu. Since momentum is a vector, their magnitudes are equal. So |p_mu| = |p_nu|.

Let me denote p as the magnitude of the muon's momentum. Then the neutrino's momentum is also p, but in the opposite direction.

Now, for each particle, the energy-momentum relation holds: E² = (pc)² + (m c²)².

So for the muon: (m_mu c² + K_mu)² = (p c)² + (m_mu c²)².

Expanding that: (m_mu² c^4 + 2 m_mu c² K_mu + K_mu²) = p² c² + m_mu² c^4.

Subtracting m_mu² c^4 from both sides:

2 m_mu c² K_mu + K_mu² = p² c².

Similarly, for the neutrino, since m_nu ≈ 0, E_nu² = (p c)^2. So E_nu = p c. But E_nu is K_nu in this case.

So K_nu = p c.

Hmm, but wait, the neutrino's energy is p c. So K_nu = p c.

Now, going back to the energy conservation equation:

m_pi c² = m_mu c² + K_mu + K_nu.

Substituting K_nu = p c, we get:

m_pi c² = m_mu c² + K_mu + p c.

But from the muon's equation, 2 m_mu c² K_mu + K_mu² = (p c)^2.

Let me try to express everything in terms of p and K_mu.

Wait, perhaps it's better to introduce variables. Let me let x = K_mu and y = K_nu.

Then from energy conservation:

139.6 = 105.7 + x + y.

So equation one: x + y = 33.9 MeV.

And from momentum considerations: y = p c.

From the muon's equation:

x² + 2 * 105.7 * x = (p c)^2.

But since y = p c, substitute into that equation:

x² + 2 * 105.7 * x = y².

But y = 33.9 - x, from equation one. So substituting:

x² + 2 * 105.7 * x = (33.9 - x)^2.

Let me expand the right side: (33.9 - x)^2 = 33.9^2 - 2*33.9 x + x².

So the equation becomes:

x² + 211.4 x = 1149.21 - 67.8 x + x².

Subtract x² from both sides:

211.4 x = 1149.21 - 67.8 x.

Combine like terms:

211.4 x + 67.8 x = 1149.21.

(211.4 + 67.8) x = 1149.21.

279.2 x = 1149.21.

x = 1149.21 / 279.2.

Let me compute that. 279.2 is approximately 279.2. Let me calculate 1149.21 divided by 279.2.

Hmm, 279.2 * 4 = 1116.8. 1149.21 - 1116.8 = 32.41. So 32.41 / 279.2 ≈ 0.116.

So x ≈ 4.116 MeV. So K_mu is approximately 4.12 MeV.

Then y = 33.9 - x = 33.9 -4.116 ≈ 29.784 MeV ≈ 29.8 MeV.

Looking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.

Wait, but let me double-check that calculation to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, 279.2 x = 1149.21.

So x = 1149.21 / 279.2.

Let me compute 279.2 * 4 = 1116.8.

Subtract from 1149.21: 1149.21 - 1116.8 = 32.41.

So 32.41 divided by 279.2 is approximately 0.116.

So 4.116, as before.

So yes, K_mu is approximately 4.12 MeV, and K_nu is 33.9 -4.12=29.78 MeV, which is approximately 29.8.

So in the options, D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So that should be the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the neutrino's kinetic energy is given as the higher value, but in the options, the first number is the muon's KE, and the second the neutrino's. So yes, D is the correct option.


To solve the problem, we analyze the decay process:

The pion (Pi⁺) is stationary and decays into a muon (mu⁺) and a neutrino (nu). The rest masses are given as:

- Rest mass of Pi⁺: \( m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Rest mass of mu⁺: \( m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \)

The neutrino's rest mass is negligible (\( m_{\nu} \approx 0 \)).

### Conservation of Energy and Momentum
1. **Energy Conservation**:  
   The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the pion:  
   \[
   E_{\text{total}} = m_{\pi} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]  
   After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino:  
   \[
   E_{\text{total}} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu}.
   \]  
   The muon's energy is \( E_{\mu} = m_{\mu} c^2 + K_{\mu} \), where \( K_{\mu} \) is its kinetic energy. The neutrino's energy is \( E_{\nu} = K_{\nu} \), since its rest mass is negligible. Thus:  
   \[
   m_{\pi} c^2 = m_{\mu} c^2 + K_{\mu} + K_{\nu}.
   \]  
   Substituting values:  
   \[
   139.6 = 105.7 + K_{\mu} + K_{\nu}.
   \]  
   Simplifying:  
   \[
   K_{\mu} + K_{\nu} = 33.9 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. **Momentum Conservation**:  
   Since the pion is stationary, the total momentum before decay is zero. After decay, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum:  
   \[
   p_{\mu} = p_{\nu}.
   \]  

3. **Energy-Momentum Relation**:  
   For the muon:  
   \[
   E_{\mu}^2 = (p_{\mu} c)^2 + (m_{\mu} c^2)^2.
   \]  
   Substituting \( E_{\mu} = m_{\mu} c^2 + K_{\mu} \):  
   \[
   (m_{\mu} c^2 + K_{\mu})^2 = (p_{\mu} c)^2 + (m_{\mu} c^2)^2.
   \]  
   Expanding and simplifying:  
   \[
   2 m_{\mu} c^2 K_{\mu} + K_{\mu}^2 = (p_{\mu} c)^2.
   \]  
   For the neutrino:  
   \[
   E_{\nu}^2 = (p_{\nu} c)^2.
   \]  
   Since \( E_{\nu} = K_{\nu} \):  
   \[
   K_{\nu}^2 = (p_{\nu} c)^2.
   \]  

4. **Solving for \( K_{\mu} \) and \( K_{\nu} \)**:  
   From momentum conservation, \( p_{\mu} = p_{\nu} \), so \( K_{\nu} = p_{\nu} c \). Substituting into the energy conservation equation:  
   \[
   K_{\mu} + K_{\nu} = 33.9.
   \]  
   Using the muon's energy-momentum relation:  
   \[
   2 m_{\mu} c^2 K_{\mu} + K_{\mu}^2 = K_{\nu}^2.
   \]  
   Substituting \( K_{\nu} = 33.9 - K_{\mu} \):  
   \[
   2 m_{\mu} c^2 K_{\mu} + K_{\mu}^2 = (33.9 - K_{\mu})^2.
   \]  
   Expanding and simplifying:  
   \[
   211.4 K_{\mu} + K_{\mu}^2 = 1149.21 - 67.8 K_{\mu} + K_{\mu}^2.
   \]  
   Canceling \( K_{\mu}^2 \):  
   \[
   211.4 K_{\mu} + 67.8 K_{\mu} = 1149.21.
   \]  
   \[
   279.2 K_{\mu} = 1149.21.
   \]  
   Solving for \( K_{\mu} \):  
   \[
   K_{\mu} = \frac{1149.21}{279.2} \approx 4.12 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]  
   Substituting \( K_{\mu} = 4.12 \, \text{MeV} \) into \( K_{\mu} + K_{\nu} = 33.9 \):  
   \[
   K_{\nu} = 33.9 - 4.12 = 29.8 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energy of the muon is \( 4.12 \, \text{MeV} \), and the kinetic energy of the neutrino is \( 29.8 \, \text{MeV} \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
