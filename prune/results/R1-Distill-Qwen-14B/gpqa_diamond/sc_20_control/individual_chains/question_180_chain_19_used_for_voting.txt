Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on electromagnetism, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the problem says there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times that. The system is isolated, so no outside influences, I guess. 

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. And the thirteenth charge is fixed at P. So, point P is where one charge is, and the other 12 are arranged in a sphere around it at a radius of 2 meters each. 

The question is about the minimum energy of the system. Energy... I think in this context, it's the electric potential energy. Because when you have charges in an electrostatic configuration, their potential energy contributes to the system's total energy. 

Wait, but why is it the minimum energy? Oh right, because the potential energy could vary based on the arrangement. But in this case, all the 12 charges are at the same distance from P, so maybe the configuration is symmetric. 

So the setup is like a central charge with 12 others equally spaced around it. But I don't think the exact arrangement (like a regular dodecahedron or something) affects the potential energy calculation here because each of the 12 is at the same distance from the central charge. 

So the potential energy of the system would be the sum of the potentials due to each pair of charges. But wait, each charge interacts with the others, right? But since the 12 are identical and fixed in place, maybe we can calculate the potential between each pair.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The total electric potential energy U for a system of charges is given by the sum over all pairs of (k * q_i * q_j) / r_ij, where r_ij is the distance between charges i and j. But in this case, most charges are at the same distance from the central one. 

Wait, but the central charge is fixed, and the 12 others are all at 2 meters from P. So each of the 12 charges is at 2 meters from the central charge. But what about the distances between the 12 charges themselves? Oh, that's probably complicated, but maybe the problem is considering only the potential between the central charge and the others, not their mutual interactions. 

Wait, why? Because the problem is asking for the minimum energy, perhaps the configuration is such that the mutual repulsion is minimized. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the 12 are fixed at 2 meters from P, so their mutual distances aren't considered, and we only calculate the energy due to their interaction with the central charge.

Hmm, but wait, the problem says the system is isolated, so all interactions matter. That would include both the central charge interacting with each of the 12, and each of the 12 interacting with each other. But calculating all the pairwise interactions between the 12 might be complicated. However, maybe the problem is designed in such a way that only the central charge's interactions are considered. But that doesn't seem right. Because the potential energy would be the sum of all pairs. 

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are identical and arranged symmetrically, so their mutual potential energy can be calculated using some formula. Wait, but I'm not sure about that. I think I might be overcomplicating it.

Wait, let me read the question again. It says: What is the minimum energy of this system correct to three decimals?

Options are in the order of 1e-26 or 1e-27, so it's a very small number. So perhaps the system's energy is due only to the central charge and the others. Let's think about that.

Each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from the central charge. So each of these 12 charges would contribute a potential energy term with the central charge. The central charge's charge is 2e, and each of the 12 is also 2e.

So the potential energy (U) between the central charge and one of the 12 is U = k * (2e) * (2e) / (2 m), where k is Coulomb's constant.

Wait, but wait: the formula for potential energy between two point charges is U = (k q1 q2) / r.

So for each of the 12 charges, the potential energy with the central charge is (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2 m). So each contributes (k * (4e²) ) / (2 m). 

But wait, the central charge is fixed. So each of the 12 charges contributes a term with the central charge. So for 12 charges, the total U would be 12 * (k * (2e)^2)/ (2 m). 

Wait, wait, each charge is 2e, right? So each q_i is 2e. So the product q_i q_j is (2e)(2e) = 4e². And r is 2 meters. So each pair (central with a surrounding charge) contributes (k *4e²)/(2 m).

So 12 such pairs would contribute 12*(k*4e²)/(2m) = (12 *4 /2) * (k e²)/(m) ) = 24 * (k e²)/(2m) ? Wait, no, wait: 12 * (4/2) is 12*2=24. So 24 * (k e²) / (2 m) ? No, wait, wait. Let me compute it correctly. 

Each pair is (2e)(2e) = 4e², so each term is (k *4e²) / (2 m) = 2 k e² / (m). So for 12 pairs, it's 12 * (2 k e² / m) ) = 24 (k e²) / m. 

But wait, is that correct? So the total potential energy due to the central charge and the surrounding 12 is 24*(k e²)/(2 m) ?

Wait, let me compute that again:

Each surrounding charge is at distance 2m from the central charge.

Each term for a single surrounding charge is U = (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2m) ) = k*(4e²)/(2 m) = 2 k e² / m.

Then, since there are 12 such charges, the total is 12 * (2 k e² / m ) = 24 k e² / m.

But wait, Coulomb's constant k is 8.988e9 N·m²/C². The elementary charge e is 1.602e-19 C.

So plugging in the numbers:

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C²

e = 1.602e-19 C

m is 2 meters.

So compute 24 * (8.988e9) * (1.602e-19)^2 / 2.

Wait, wait: 24 * (k e²) / m.

Wait, m is 2 meters. So 24 * (8.988e9) * (1.602e-19)^2 / 2.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, compute e squared: (1.602e-19)^2 = (2.566e-38) C².

Then, compute k * e²: 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = ?

8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = (8.988 * 2.566) * 1e9 * 1e-38.

8.988 * 2.566 ≈ let's see: 8 * 2.5 is 20. Then, 0.988 * 2.566 ≈ about 2.545. So total ~22.545.

But more accurately, let's compute 8.988 * 2.566.

8 * 2.566 = 20.528

0.988 * 2.566 ≈ 2.544 (since 0.988 * 2.5 = 2.47, 0.988 * 0.066 ≈ ~0.065, so total about 2.535 )

So overall, 20.528 + 2.535 = 23.063 approximately.

So 23.063e-29 (since 1e9 * 1e-38 = 1e-29).

Wait, because 8.988e9 is 8.988 x 1e9, and e² is 2.566e-38.

So 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = (8.988 * 2.566) * 1e9 * 1e-38 = 23.063 * 1e-29 = 2.3063e-28.

So now, multiply by 24 and then divide by m=2.

So 24 * (2.3063e-28) / 2 = (24 /2) * 2.3063e-28 = 12 * 2.3063e-28.

12 * 2.3063e-28 = 27.6756e-28 = 2.76756e-27 J.

Wait, but wait, that's if we're only considering the potential energy between the central charge and the 12 other charges. But what about the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves? Because each of the 12 is a 2e charge, so each pair among them contributes potential energy.

Oh! I think I forgot that part. Because the problem is about the total potential energy of the system, which includes all pairs. So I need to calculate the potential between each of the 12 and every other, as well as each and the central charge.

So the total U is sum of all pairs. So the total U is U_central + U_surrounding.

Wait, but I need to compute two parts:

1. The potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the central charge.

2. The potential energy between each pair among the 12 surrounding charges.

Because in an isolated system, all interactions are considered.

So let me re-calculate.

First part: Each of the 12 charges interacts with the central charge. So 12 charges each contribute (k*(2e)*(2e))/(2m) = (4e² k)/(2m) = 2 e² k / m.

Total for 12: 12 * (2 e² k / m) = 24 e² k / m.

Second part: The mutual interactions between the 12 surrounding charges. Each pair contributes (k*(2e)*(2e))/r_ij, where r_ij is the distance between any two of the 12.

But wait, the problem states that the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from point P, but it doesn't specify their distance from each other. So we can't assume they're all at the same distance from each other. Hmm, that complicates things because without knowing their arrangement, we can't compute their mutual distances.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum energy. So perhaps the minimal energy occurs when the mutual repulsion is minimized. Oh wait, but like charges repel, so the minimal potential energy would be when the charges are as far apart as possible, because U is positive for like charges (since U = k q1 q2 / r, and both q are positive). So to minimize the total potential energy (which is positive), you need to minimize the sum of the U's. Since U is positive, to get the minimum sum, you'd arrange the charges as far apart as possible. But wait, in reality, the potential energy would be positive, and the minimum possible would be when the charges are as far apart as possible, thus making each U as small as possible.

Wait, but wait, the potential energy for like charges is positive and increases as they come closer. So to minimize the total potential energy, you want to maximize the distances between each pair. But in this problem, the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from P, but their mutual distances are not specified. So perhaps the problem implicitly assumes that the 12 are arranged in a way that their mutual distances are the same as the distance from P, which is 2 meters. Or maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the potential from the central charge and not the mutual charges.

Wait, but the options are of the order of 1e-26 or 1e-27. The calculation I did earlier for just the central charge's contribution was 2.76756e-27 J, which is approximately 2.77e-27. Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 7e-27. Hmm, that's more than the 2.7e-27 I got earlier. So maybe that's part of the calculation, but I'm missing the mutual interactions.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the energy between the central charge and the 12 others, not the mutual energy between the 12. But why would that be the case? Because the problem asks for the minimum energy of the system, which would include all interactions.

Wait, perhaps the mutual repulsion is arranged in such a way that each of the 12 charges is equally spaced on a sphere of radius 2m, so that their mutual potential is minimized. Or, perhaps, the mutual distances are all the same, but I don't know how that would affect the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the central charge's contribution, and the mutual contributions are being neglected, perhaps because the 12 charges are fixed in place and their mutual interactions are considered constant.

Wait, but the problem states that it's an isolated system, so all their mutual interactions should be considered. Otherwise, the problem would not mention the system's energy correctly. Hmm, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential due to the central charge, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is fixed at 2m from P, but their mutual distances are such that the potential energy between them is zero. But that can't be, because like charges repel, so their mutual potential energy would be positive.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are so large that their potential energy is negligible compared to the central charge's contribution. But the problem doesn't state that, so I can't assume that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential between the central charge and the others, because the mutual potential between the 12 is considered part of the fixed setup, and thus the minimum energy is only the central's contribution.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the potential energy calculation again.

The total potential energy U is the sum of all pairwise interactions.

So U = U_central + U_surrounding.

Where U_central is the sum of the energy between the central charge and each of the 12.

U_central = 12 * (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2m) = 12 * (4e² k) / (2m) ) = 24 e² k / (2m) ) ?

Wait, no, 12 * (4 e² k) / (2m) = 12 * (2 e² k / m ) = 24 e² k / m.

Wait, let me recheck that calculation. Each term is (2e)(2e) =4 e², divided by 2m, multiplied by k. So each term is (4 e² k)/(2m) = 2 e² k / m.

Multiply by 12: 12 * (2 e² k / m ) = 24 e² k / m.

Now for the surrounding charges: Each pair of the 12 contributes (k (2e)(2e))/r_ij. But without knowing r_ij, I can't compute this. So perhaps the problem expects us to neglect this part because the 12 charges are constrained and their mutual distances are not given. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the central charge's interactions.

Hmm, but the option I calculated earlier (24 e² k / m ) gives 2.76756e-27 J. Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 2.56 times higher than that.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute.

Wait, let me recalculate 24 * (k e²) / m.

Wait, I think I may have miscalculated the exponents. Let me recompute:

e = 1.602e-19 C.

e² = (1.602e-19)^2 = (approx) 2.566e-38 C².

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So e² * k = 2.566e-38 * 8.988e9 = let's compute 2.566e-38 * 8.988e9.

Multiply 2.566 and 8.988: approximately 2.566 * 9 = 23.094, but more accurately:

8.988 * 2.566 = ?

Let me compute 2.566 * 9 = 23.094, but since it's 8.988 instead of 9, subtract 0.012 * 2.566 ≈ 0.0308. So 23.094 - 0.0308 ≈ 23.063.

So e² * k ≈ 23.063e-38 + 9 → Wait, no: exponents are 1e-38 * 1e9 = 1e-29.

So 23.063e-29. So that's 2.3063e-28.

Now, 24 * (2.3063e-28) / (2 meters).

Wait, 24 divided by 2 is 12. So 12 * 2.3063e-28 = 27.6756e-28 = 2.76756e-27 J.

So that's the U_central part.

But then, what about the U_surrounding part? Without knowing the mutual distances, I can't compute it. So perhaps the problem is only considering the central charge's contribution, making the answer 2.76756e-27 J. But looking at the options, none of them match that exactly. The closest option is C) 7.056e-27, which is about 2.55 times larger than 2.767e-27.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again about the units.

Wait, 24 * (k e²) / m.

Wait, m is 2 meters, so 24 * (k e²) / 2 = 12 * (k e²) .

So 12 * (8.988e9) * (1.602e-19)^2.

Wait, let's compute that again.

12 * (8.988e9) * (2.566e-38) = ?

Compute 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = 23.063e-29 (as before).

Multiply by 12: 23.063e-29 *12 = 276.756e-29 = 2.76756e-27 J.

So that's 2.76756e-27 J for the central charge contribution.

But looking at the options, none of them are exactly that. Option B is 2.822e-26, which is about 10 times larger. Option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 2.55 times larger.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the exponents again.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that each of the 12 charges is contributing to the potential, and perhaps I missed a factor. Let me think again.

Wait, when you have a charge q fixed at a point, and n other charges each of charge q at a distance r from it, the potential energy is U = n * (k q^2)/(r).

So in this case, n is 12, q is 2e, r is 2 m.

So U_central = 12 * (k (2e)^2)/(2 m) 

Which is 12 * k (4e²) / (2m) 

= 12 * (4/2) * (k e²)/m 

= 12 * 2 * (k e²/m) 

= 24 (k e²/m )

So yes, that's correct. So 24 * (8.988e9) * (1.602e-19)^2 /2 ?

Wait, no: 24 * (k * e²) / (2m) ?

Wait, wait: no, the formula is n * (k q^2)/r. So 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) = 12 * (4e² k)/(2m) = 12 * 2 e² k / m = 24 e² k / m.

So yes, that's correct.

So 24 * (8.988e9) * (2.566e-38) /2 ?

Wait, no, because we have 24 * (e² k)/m, where m=2.

Wait, 24 * (e² k) / m = 24 * (e² k) / 2 = 12 * e² k.

So the calculation is 12 * e² k.

Which is 12 * (1.602e-19)^2 * 8.988e9.

Wait, (1.602e-19)^2 is 2.566e-38.

2.566e-38 * 8.988e9 = 2.566e-38 * 8.988e9 = 2.566 * 8.988 = ~23.063, times 1e-38+9 = 1e-29.

So 23.063e-29 = 2.3063e-28.

Then, 12 * 2.3063e-28 = 27.6756e-28 = 2.76756e-27 J.

So that's about 2.76756e-27 J. Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 2.55 times higher. So perhaps I'm missing a factor somewhere.

Wait, did I forget that each of the 12 charges also contributes to the potential with the central charge, and perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 because each pair is counted once? Wait no, because in the formula U = sum over all pairs, but in this case, each of the 12 is paired once with the central charge. So 12 pairs, each contributing (k * 2e * 2e)/(2m).

Hmm. Another thought: perhaps the problem is using a different approach, considering the potential energy as the work done to assemble the charges. But perhaps I should think about the potential energy as the sum of each charge's contribution, but perhaps I made a mistake in the number of interactions.

Wait, each of the 12 charges interacts with the central charge once. So 12 interactions. Each contributes (k (2e)(2e))/(2m) = 4e² k/(2m) = 2 e² k/m.

So 12 * (2 e² k/m) = 24 e² k/m.

Which is 24 * (8.988e9) * (1.602e-19)^2 / 2.

Wait, m is 2, so 24 * (e² k) / 2 = 12 e² k.

Which is 12 * 2.3063e-28 = 2.76756e-27 J.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering all the interactions, including the mutual ones between the 12 charges. But without knowing their distances, I can't compute that. So perhaps the problem is only asking for the potential due to the central charge and the surrounding 12, not their mutual interactions. Therefore, the answer should be around 2.77e-27 J. But none of the options match that exactly.

Wait, looking at the options again:

A) 5.645 x 10^-26 → about 5.6e-26 J

B) 2.822 x10^-26 → 2.8e-26 J

C)7.056 x10^-27 →7e-27 J

D)122.330 → way bigger, perhaps in J, but the others are about 1e-26 or smaller.

Wait, option B is 2.8e-26, which is roughly 10 times larger than my calculated 2.7e-27. Hmm, why would that be?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the exponent. Let me recalculate the exponents carefully.

e = 1.602e-19 C, so e² is (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

k =8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So e² * k = 2.566e-38 * 8.988e9 = ?

So 2.566e-38 * 8.988e9 = (2.566 * 8.988) * 1e-38 +9 → 2.566 *8.988 is about 23.06, and 1e-38+9=1e-29.

So e² k =23.06e-29 = 2.306e-28.

Now, 24 * (e² k) / (2m) → 12 * e² k.

Wait, because 24 * (e² k) / (2m) = 12 * (e² k)/m. Since m=2 meters, (e² k)/m is (2.306e-28)/2 = 1.153e-28.

Then, 12 * 1.153e-28 = 13.836e-28 = 1.3836e-27 J.

Wait, earlier I thought it was 2.76e-27, but this comes to 1.38e-27. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents somewhere.

Wait, 24 * (e² k) / m → m=2.

So 24 * (e² k) / 2 = 12 * e² k.

e² k =2.306e-28.

So 12 * 2.306e-28 = 27.67e-28 = 2.767e-27 J.

Ah, I see. So earlier calculation was correct, 2.767e-27 J.

But the options don't have that. The closest is option C, which is 7.056e-27, which is about 2.55 times larger. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of pairs. Let me think again.

Wait, each of the 12 charges contributes a term with the central charge. So 12 terms, each of (k*(2e)^2)/(2m). So 12 * (4 e² k)/(2m) =12 * 2 e² k/m = 24 e² k/m.

Which is 24 * (8.988e9) * (1.602e-19)^2 / 2.

Wait, 24 * (8.988e9) * (2.566e-38) / 2.

Wait, 24/2=12. So 12 * 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38.

Which is 12 * (8.988 * 2.566) * 1e9 *1e-38.

8.988 *2.566 ≈23.06.

So 12 *23.06 *1e-29 → 12 *23.06e-29 = 276.72e-29 = 2.7672e-27 J.

So that's correct, 2.767e-27 J.

Looking at the options, none match exactly. So perhaps the problem is only considering the potential between the central charge and one of the surrounding charges, not all 12. But that would make the energy much smaller, which isn't reflected in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12, but each term is (k * 2e * 2e ) / (2m), which is (4e² k)/(2m) = 2e² k/m. For 12 charges, 12 * 2e² k/m =24 e² k/m.

Which brings us back to 2.767e-27 J.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem is using a different value for Coulomb's constant. Sometimes, it's approximated as 9e9 instead of 8.988e9. Let me try that.

If k=9e9 N·m²/C²,

Then e² k = (1.602e-19)^2 *9e9 = 2.566e-38 *9e9 =23.094e-29 = 2.3094e-28.

Then 24 * (9e9 * e²) / (2m) → 24 * (2.3094e-28) / 2 = 12 *2.3094e-28 =27.7128e-28 =2.77128e-27 J.

Still about 2.77e-27.

Again, no option matches that.

Wait, looking back at the question: The 13th charge is fixed at P. So perhaps it's not moving, so its potential energy is zero? Wait, no, because the potential energy is relative. The potential energy of the system is the sum of the interactions.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is calculated differently. Let me think about another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy as the work done to bring each charge from infinity to its position. Since the central charge is fixed, when bringing each of the 12 charges to their positions, each contributes U = (k * 2e * 2e )/(2m). So each charge brings 2e² k/(2m) = e² k/m. For 12 charges, 12*(e² k/m) =12 * ( (1.602e-19)^2 *8.988e9 ) / 2.

Wait, no, because m=2, so 12 * e² k /2.

Wait, e² k =2.306e-28.

12 *2.306e-28 /2 = 12 *1.153e-28 =13.836e-28 =1.3836e-27 J. Hmm, but that's not matching any options either.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 because each charge is 2e, so each interaction is (2e)^2 =4e². So the calculation is correct.

Given that, none of the options match the 2.767e-27 J that I calculated.

Wait, let me check the options again. Option C is7.056e-27. Let's see: 7.056e-27 is approximately 2.55 times 2.767e-27.

Hmm, 2.767e-27 * 2.55 = approx 7.05e-27.

So what could cause a factor of 2.55? Perhaps I missed a factor of 3, but where would that come from?

Wait, perhaps the problem is calculating the potential energy between each pair, but each pair is counted twice. Wait, no, because in the formula U = sum_{i<j} (k q_i q_j / r_ij), each pair is considered once.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Wait, perhaps the formula for potential energy when you have a fixed charge is different. Let me think.

Wait, the formula for the potential energy of a system when you have a fixed charge Q and another charge q brought to a distance r is U = (k Q q )/ r.

But in this case, the central charge is fixed, and each of the 12 charges is brought to 2m from it. So each brings an energy of (k (2e)(2e))/(2m) = (4e² k)/(2m) = 2e² k/m.

So 12 times that is 24 e² k/m.

Which brings us back to 2.767e-27 J.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the energy as the sum of all pairs, including the 12 charges among themselves. But without knowing their mutual distances, how can that be calculated?

Wait, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a regular dodecahedron or some regular shape around the central charge, so that the average distance between them is such that each pair contributes a certain amount. But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's impossible to compute accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual distances are all 2m, but that's not possible in 3D space because you can't have 12 identical points all 2m apart around a central point without overlapping.

So perhaps the problem is only considering the central charge's interactions, making the answer 2.77e-27 J, which is closest to option C, 7.056e-27, but that's not close. Wait, maybe I made a calculation error earlier.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the exponents. Let me recompute the numerical values again.

Let me compute each part step by step.

Compute (2e)^2: (2 * 1.602e-19)^2 = (3.204e-19)^2 = 10.265e-38 C².

Wait, wait no: (2e)^2 =4e², which is 4 * (1.602e-19)^2 =4 *2.566e-38=10.265e-38 C².

So, for each surrounding charge, the energy is (k * (2e)^2 ) / (2m).

Which is (8.988e9 * 10.265e-38) / (2 *2).

Wait, 8.988e9 *10.265e-38 = let's compute.

8.988e9 *10.265e-38 = (8.988 *10.265) * 1e9 *1e-38.

8.988 *10.265 ≈ 92.33 (since 10 * 9 =90, 0.265 *9=2.385; 8.988*0.265≈2.387; total ≈92.33).

So 92.33e-29 = 9.233e-28.

Then, divide by (2*2)=4: 9.233e-28 /4 =2.308e-28.

Each surrounding charge contributes 2.308e-28 J.

Multiply by 12: 12 * 2.308e-28 =27.696e-28 =2.7696e-27 J.

Same as before. So no, I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering the central charge as part of the system's potential energy? That can't be right because the central charge is part of the system.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering the total energy including the kinetic energy. But since the system is isolated and the particles are constrained, their kinetic energy would be zero if they're at rest. So the potential energy is the total energy.

Hmm. I'm stuck. None of the options match the 2.77e-27 J I calculated.

Wait, let me look at option B: 2.822e-26 J. That's about 10 times larger than my calculation. Could I have missed a factor of 10 somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I forgot that each of the 12 charges also contributes to the potential from the central charge's perspective, but in the formula, it's accounted for once. Hmm, I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the charge as e instead of 2e. Let me check the problem statement again.

The problem says each charge is 2e. So no, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of e². Let me compute e² again.

e =1.602e-19 C.

e squared is (1.602e-19)^2 = (1.602)^2 * 1e-38.

1.602 squared is approximately 2.566.

So e² =2.566e-38 C². Correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 24 * (k e²)/m.

Wait, m=2 meters. So 24 * (8.988e9 * 2.566e-38) / 2.

Wait, 24 divided by 2 is 12. So 12 * (8.988e9 *2.566e-38) =12 * (23.063e-29) =276.756e-29 =2.76756e-27 J.

Yes, same as before.

Hmm. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options. But that can't be. So maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another possibility: the problem is considering that the 12 charges are each at 2m from P, but the central charge is at P. So the potential energy is the sum of all pairs, including the central charge with each of the 12, and each pair among the 12.

But without knowing the mutual distances, perhaps the problem is assuming that the mutual distances are the same as the distance from the central charge, which is 2m. So each pair among the 12 is at 2m apart. That would make their mutual potential contribute.

So the total U would be U_central + U_surrounding.

U_central =12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) =24 e² k/(2m) = 24 e² k / (2 *2) ?

Wait, no, m is 2 meters, so 24 e² k / (2m) → 24 e² k / (4) =6 e² k.

Wait, 24 * (k (2e)^2)/(2m) =24 * (4 e² k)/(2*2) ) → 24 *4 e² k/(4) → 24 e² k.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me recompute U_central and U_surrounding.

U_central =12 * (k (2e)(2e) )/(2m) )=12*(4 e² k)/(2*2) )= 12*(4 e² k)/(4) )= 12 e² k.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me see. Wait, 2m is the distance between the central charge and each of the 12. So yes, each term is (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) = (4e² k)/(2m).

So 12 terms give 12*(4 e² k)/(2m) ) = (48 e² k)/(2m) ) =24 e² k/m.

So U_central =24 e² k/m, with m=2.

So 24 e² k/(2) =12 e² k.

Which is 12 * (8.988e9) * (2.566e-38) =12 * 23.063e-29 =276.756e-29 → 2.76756e-27 J. Same as before.

Now, for U_surrounding: each of the 12 charges interacts with 11 others.

So the number of pairs is C(12,2) =66 pairs.

Each pair contributes (k*(2e)^2)/(r), where r is the distance between them. If we assume that each pair is at a distance of 2m, then each term is (4e² k)/(2m) =2 e² k/m.

So total U_surrounding =66 * (2 e² k/m) )=132 e² k/m.

Which is 132 * (8.988e9) * (2.566e-38) / 2.

Wait, m=2, so 132 * (8.988e9) * (2.566e-38) / 2.

Wait, 132/2=66.

So 66 * (8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 ) =66 * 23.063e-29 =1521.  66 *23.063e-29 = let's compute 66 *23.063 = approx 1521. So 1521e-29 =1.521e-26 J.

So U_surrounding is 1.521e-26 J.

Then, the total U =U_central + U_surrounding =2.767e-27 +1.521e-26 = approximately 1.8e-26 J.

But the options don't have anything near that. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, but the problem says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from P. It doesn't say anything about their mutual distances. So perhaps the mutual distances are not 2m, making this approach invalid. Thus, the problem is only considering the central charge's contribution, making the answer 2.767e-27 J, which is not an option.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different formula for potential energy when you have multiple charges. Like the formula U = (1/2) * sum (k q_i q_j / r_ij ). Because each pair is counted once, but perhaps the formula is considering it as (1/2) the sum of all pairs.

But no, the formula already includes each pair once. So that would not change the result.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for potential energy as (k q Q )/ r, where Q is the total charge of the system except q. So in this case, the central charge is 2e, and each surrounding charge is 2e. So the potential energy for each surrounding charge is (k *2e * (2e + sum of other 11 charges )) / r.

Wait, because when you bring a charge q into a field created by other charges, the potential energy is q times the potential at that point.

So the potential at point P due to the 12 surrounding charges is V = k (12 *2e)/ (2m) )=k*(24e)/(2m) )=12 e k/m.

So when bringing each of the 12 charges to their positions, each contributes a potential energy of (2e) * V, where V is the potential at that point before placing the charge.

Wait, but the charges are being placed one by one, so when placing the first charge, the potential at its position is zero because no other charges are present. Then, when placing the second charge, the potential at its position is due to the first charge, and so on.

But this approach would involve a lot of calculations, as each charge's placement affects the potential for the next.

This seems complicated, but perhaps it's the correct approach.

So let's model it as placing each charge one by one and calculating the work done.

The first charge: placed at 2m from P, the central charge is 2e. The potential at that point due to the central charge is V = k*(2e)/(2m) )= k e/(m).

So when placing the first charge (2e) into this potential, the work done is (2e) * V =2e * (k e/m )= 2 k e² /m.

Then, the second charge: when placing the second charge, the potential at its position is due to the central charge (V1 =k*(2e)/(2m) )=k e/m) and due to the first charge (V2 =k*(2e)/(distance between charge 1 and 2)).

Wait, but the problem states that the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from P. But their mutual distances are not specified, so perhaps this approach is not feasible without more information.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the central charge's potential and not the mutual potentials, making the answer 2.767e-27 J, but that's not an option.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the potential energy between the central charge and all the others, which we calculated as 2.767e-27 J, and that's the answer, but none of the options match.

Wait, looking at the options again, option B is 2.822e-26 J, which is about 10 times larger than my calculated value. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation by a factor of 10. Let me check the exponents again.

Wait, e is 1.6e-19, so e squared is 2.56e-38.

k is 8.988e9, so when I multiply 8.988e9 by 2.56e-38, I get 23.06e-29. Correct.

Multiply by 24, divide by 2m=4 m?

No, m=2, so 24 * (e² k) /2 =12 e² k.

12 *23.06e-29 =276.72e-29 =2.7672e-27 J.

Hmm. So I'm confident in this calculation, but it's not matching any option. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that can't be the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the central charge as part of the system and calculating the potential energy between it and each of the 12, but each pair is counted twice. So perhaps the U_central is 12 * (k (2e)^2)/(2m) ) → but that would be 24 e² k/m.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula and the correct formula is (k (2e)(2e))/r, which is 4 e² k/(2m) )=2 e² k/m. So for 12 charges, 12*2 e² k/m =24 e² k/m.

So 24*(8.988e9)*(2.566e-38) / 2.

Wait, wait, 24 * (8.988e9) * (2.566e-38) =24 * (23.063e-29) )=553.512e-29 =5.535e-27.

Divide by 2m=4 →5.535e-27 /4 =1.383e-27 J.

Hmm, that's different. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the calculation.

Wait, no, because 24 * (e² k) / m is 24 * (2.306e-28) / 2.

Wait, because m=2, so 24 *2.306e-28 /2 = 12 *2.306e-28 =27.67e-28 =2.767e-27 J.

Hmm. So I'm back to the same number.

I'm stuck. I think I'll have to proceed with the calculation I have, which is 2.767e-27 J, but none of the options match. However, looking at option C, 7.056e-27 is about 2.55 times larger. Perhaps I made a mistake in the number of pairs.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges contributes to the potential energy as (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) * 12, but the correct calculation is 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) )=12*(4e² k)/(2m) )=24 e² k/m.

Which gives 2.767e-27 J. Not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for potential energy as (1/2) sum (k q_i q_j / r_ij ), which would halve the value. But 2.767e-27 /2 =1.383e-27, which is still not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the central charge as part of the 12, but no, the problem states that the 13th charge is fixed at P.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Based on my calculations, the correct answer should be approximately 2.767e-27 J, but none of the options match. The closest option is C)7.056e-27.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute everything numerically again.

Compute 24 * (8.988e9) * (1.602e-19)^2 / (2 *2).

First, (1.602e-19)^2 =2.566e-38.

8.988e9 *2.566e-38 =23.063e-29.

Multiply by 24: 24 *23.063e-29 =553.512e-29.

Divide by (2 *2)=4: 553.512e-29/4 =138.378e-29 =1.3838e-27 J.

Ah! Wait, I think I see the mistake. Earlier, I thought that the distance r was 2 meters, but the formula is (k q1 q2)/r. So for each of the 12 charges, the distance is 2m. So the formula is correct.

Wait, but then 24 * (8.988e9 * (2e)^2 ) / (2m) ) =24 * (8.988e9 *4e² )/(4) ) → because (2e)^2 is4e², and 2m is4.

So 24 * (8.988e9 *4e² ) /4.

The 4 in numerator and denominator cancel, leaving 24 * (8.988e9 * e² ).

Which is 24 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

So 24 *8.988e9 =215.712e9.

(1.602e-19)^2 is2.566e-38.

So 215.712e9 *2.566e-38 = (215.712 *2.566 )e-29.

215.712 *2.566 ≈ 553.5.

So 553.5e-29 =5.535e-27 J.

Wait, but that's not matching. Hmm.

Wait, no, because the formula is 24 * (k q^2)/(r), with q=2e and r=2m.

So 24 * (8.988e9 * (2e)^2 ) / (2m).

Which is 24 * (8.988e9 *4e² )/(2*2).

Because m=2, so denominator is 4.

8.988e9 *4e² =8.988e9 *4*(1.602e-19)^2.

Which is 8.988e9 *4*2.566e-38 =8.988e9 *10.264e-38 =92.3e-29.

Then, 24 *92.3e-29 /4 → because denominator is 4.

24/4=6.

6 *92.3e-29 =553.8e-29 =5.538e-27 J.

Hmm, this brings us back to the same number, 5.538e-27 J. Which is about 5.5e-27 J.

Looking back at the options:

A)5.645e-26 →5.6e-26 J → larger by a factor of 10.

C)7.056e-27 → about 1.27 times larger than 5.538e-27.

Hmm. I think I'm going in circles here. I'll have to make a choice based on my calculations.

The correct calculation based on the given data and the formula seems to be approximately2.767e-27 J, but the closest option is C)7.056e-27. Wait, but that's about 2.55 times larger. Perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that each charge is 2e, so each pair contributes (2e)^2 =4e², and the number of pairs is 12, leading to 12*4e²=48e². But I don't see how that would change the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12, which is 12 terms, each (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) → 12 * (4e² k)/(2m) =24 e² k/m.

Which is 2.767e-27 J.

But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the potential energy is the sum of all pairs, including the mutual ones between the 12 charges, but with r_ij being very large, making their contribution negligible. Then, the total U would be approximately 2.767e-27 J, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, such as considering the potential at point P due to all 12 charges, and then the potential energy is (2e) times that potential.

The potential at P due to the 12 charges is V = k*(12 *2e)/ (2m) )=12e k/(2m) )=6e k/m.

So the potential energy U is (2e) * V =2e * (6e k/m )=12 e² k/m.

Which is 12 * (8.988e9) * (2.566e-38) /2.

Wait, m=2, so 12 *8.988e9 *2.566e-38 /2.

Which is 6 *8.988e9 *2.566e-38.

6 *8.988e9 =53.928e9.

53.928e9 *2.566e-38 = (53.928 *2.566) e-29.

53.928 *2.566 ≈138.37.

So 138.37e-29 =1.3837e-27 J.

Still, this is about 1.38e-27 J, which is not among the options.

At this point, I think the correct answer based on the given data is approximately 2.767e-27 J. Since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is option B) 2.822e-26, but I can't see where the mistake would be to reach that number.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the central charge as 2e and the surrounding as 12 charges of 2e, making the total charge 26e, but I don't see how that would affect the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for potential energy as (1/2) sum (k q_i q_j / r_ij ), which would halve the central charge contribution. Then, 2.767e-27 /2 =1.383e-27 J, which is not an option.

I'm stuck. Based on my calculations, the correct answer should be approximately 2.767e-27 J, but the closest option is C)7.056e-27, which is about 2.55 times larger. I'm not sure why, but I'll have to go with the calculation I have.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the minimum potential energy of an isolated system consisting of 13 identical particles, each with charge \( 2e \). The setup includes a central charge fixed at point \( P \), and 12 other charges constrained to remain at a distance of 2 meters from \( P \). The goal is to compute the total potential energy of the system.

The total potential energy \( U \) of the system is the sum of contributions from all pairs of charges. However, the problem does not explicitly include the mutual interactions between the 12 surrounding charges due to insufficient information about their mutual distances. Thus, the calculation focuses on the interactions between the central charge and the 12 surrounding charges.

### Key Formula
The potential energy between two charges \( q_1 \) and \( q_2 \) separated by a distance \( r \) is given by:
\[
U = \frac{k q_1 q_2}{r}
\]
where \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \) is Coulomb's constant.

For the central charge \( q_c = 2e \) and each surrounding charge \( q_s = 2e \), the distance between them is \( r = 2 \, \text{m} \). The potential energy contribution from each surrounding charge to the central charge is:
\[
U_{\text{single}} = \frac{k (2e)(2e)}{2} = \frac{4e^2 k}{2} = 2e^2 k
\]
Since there are 12 surrounding charges, the total contribution from all 12 charges is:
\[
U_{\text{central}} = 12 \cdot U_{\text{single}} = 12 \cdot 2e^2 k = 24e^2 k
\]

### Substituting Values
- \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \)
- \( e^2 = (1.602 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 2.566 \times 10^{-38} \, \text{C}^2 \)
- \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \)

Substituting into \( U_{\text{central}} \):
\[
U_{\text{central}} = 24 \cdot (8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot (2.566 \times 10^{-38})
\]
First, calculate \( k \cdot e^2 \):
\[
k \cdot e^2 = (8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot (2.566 \times 10^{-38}) = 23.063 \times 10^{-29}
\]
Then multiply by 24:
\[
U_{\text{central}} = 24 \cdot 23.063 \times 10^{-29} = 553.512 \times 10^{-29} = 5.535 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}
\]

### Comparison with Options
The calculated potential energy \( U_{\text{central}} \) is approximately \( 5.535 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \). However, none of the provided options match this value exactly. The closest option is **C) \( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \)**, which is about 2.55 times larger than the calculated value. This discrepancy may arise from approximations or assumptions not explicitly stated in the problem.

### Conclusion
Based on the calculations, the minimum potential energy of the system is approximately \( 5.535 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \). However, since this value does not match any of the options, the closest available choice is selected.

ANSWER: C
