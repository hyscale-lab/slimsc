Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particle physics, specifically about boson decay. Hmm, let me see. The question is about the allowed decay modes of a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV. The Lagrangian interaction is given, but I'm not sure if I need to focus on that right now. Let me break it down.

First, the boson X has a mass of 6 GeV. I remember that in particle physics, the decay products must have a combined mass less than the mass of the decaying particle. So for X to decay into fermions, the sum of their masses must be less than 6 GeV.

Looking at the options, they all have various fermion pairs. The fermions are like quarks and leptons. I think I should list out all possible fermions and their masses to see which can be produced.

Let me recall the masses of the known particles. I'll start with the quarks. Up and down quarks are the lightest. Their masses are around 2 MeV each, so negligible compared to 6 GeV. The strange quark is heavier, maybe around 100 MeV, still way less. The charm quark is about 1.5 GeV, and the bottom quark is around 4.5 GeV. The top quark is the heaviest at about 173 GeV, which is way above 6 GeV. So top quarks are out.

Leptons: electrons are about 0.0005 GeV, muons around 0.1 GeV, taus are about 1.78 GeV. Neutrinos are almost massless, so they're not in the options. So for leptons, the tau is the heaviest, but let's check.

So for X to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, the mass of the fermion must be less than half of X's mass. X is 6 GeV, so each fermion must be less than 3 GeV.

Looking at quarks: up, down, strange, charm are all below 3 GeV. So their pairs are possible. Bottom quarks are around 4.5 GeV each. So 4.5 is more than 3 GeV, so can't have b bbar because 4.5*2=9 GeV, which is more than 6. So b quarks are out.

Wait, no. Wait, for a decay into a pair, the mass of each particle must be less than the X mass, but for a two-body decay, the maximum mass each can have is when they are produced at rest. So the sum of the masses must be less than the X mass. So the sum of the two fermions (each is m) must be less than 6 GeV. But since they are a pair (like fermion and anti), the total is 2m < 6 GeV. So m <3 GeV.

So any fermion with mass less than 3 GeV can be produced.

So let's list fermions by mass:

Up quark: ~2 MeV (<<3 GeV)
Down: same as up
Strange: ~100 MeV (<<3)
Charm: ~1.5 GeV (<3)
Bottom: ~4.5 GeV (>3) → cannot
Top: way too heavy.

Leptons:
Electron: ~0.0005 GeV
Muon: ~0.1
Tau: ~1.78 GeV

So all quarks except bottom can be decay products. So the possible quark pairs are u, d, s, c.

Wait, but in the options, I see particles like c cbar, which is charm. So that's allowed.

Leptons: e+, e-, mu+, mu-, tau+ tau-. All are allowed because their masses are under 3 GeV. Tau's mass is 1.78, so 2*1.78 is 3.56, which is less than 6 GeV. Wait, wait—no, wait. Wait, the sum of the fermion and anti-fermion masses must be less than 6 GeV. Each tau is 1.78, so 2*1.78 is 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So that's fine.

Wait, but wait a second. The sum of the masses must be less than the mass of X. So for a pair, each has mass m, so 2m <6 GeV → m <3 GeV. Taus are about 1.78 GeV, which is less than 3, so they're allowed.

So for fermions, any with mass less than 3 GeV are allowed.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: X → b, s, u, d, tau, e
But wait, no. Let me read option A. It says X → b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Wait, wait. The b quark is 4.5 GeV, which is more than 3, so can't decay into b bbar, because each b is 4.5 GeV, so two would be 9 GeV, which is more than X's 6 GeV. So Option A includes b and e. So that includes b which is too heavy, so A is incorrect because it includes b.

Option B: X→ c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

All these fermions have masses less than 3 GeV. So this is correct for fermions. But wait, what about the c quark: 1.5 GeV. 2*1.5=3 <6. So yes.

Option C: X→ c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, t tbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

But t quark is way too heavy. So option C includes t tbar, which is impossible, so option C is wrong.

Option D: X→ b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Same issue as option A: includes b. So option D is incorrect.

Wait, but wait. Let me check. Option B's decay includes c cbar, which is allowed because 2*1.5=3 <6.

So the correct decay products should include:

Quark pairs: u, d, s, c.

Lepton pairs: e, mu, tau.

So looking at the options, option B includes all of these.

Option B is: c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau, mu, e pairs.

So that's correct. Option B is the correct answer.

Wait, but wait another thought. The Lagrangian given in the question: L(y) = -λ f ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I think I might have missed something. Wait, in the Lagrangian, the interaction term is proportional to X times ψ_f^dagger ψ_f. Wait, wait, no. Let me parse this. The interaction term is -λ f ψ_f bar (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So that's like X times ψ ψ. So the vertex is X ψ ψ. So the interaction is X coupling to a fermion and its antifermion. So decay modes would be X → ψ ψ-bar.

Wait, but that's the same as X → f f-bar, which is what I was considering. So my earlier analysis holds.

So the allowed fermions are those with mass below 3 GeV. So option B includes c cbar (since c is 1.5 GeV). So option B is correct.

The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. For a decay into a fermion-antifermion pair (\( f \bar{f} \)), the combined mass of the fermion and antifermion must be less than the mass of \( X \). Since \( X \) has a mass of 6 GeV, the maximum mass of each fermion is \( m_f < 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Analysis of Fermion Masses:
1. **Quarks**:
   - Up (\( u \)): \( \sim 2 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.
   - Down (\( d \)): \( \sim 2 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.
   - Strange (\( s \)): \( \sim 100 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.
   - Charm (\( c \)): \( \sim 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
   - Bottom (\( b \)): \( \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \), not allowed (exceeds 3 GeV).
   - Top (\( t \)): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \), not allowed (far exceeds 6 GeV).

2. **Leptons**:
   - Electron (\( e \)): \( \sim 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
   - Muon (\( \mu \)): \( \sim 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
   - Tau (\( \tau \)): \( \sim 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
   - Neutrinos: Negligibly small mass, but not included in the options.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed because the bottom quark is too heavy (\( 4.5 \, \text{GeV} > 3 \, \text{GeV} \)). Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c} \), \( s \bar{s} \), \( u \bar{u} \), \( d \bar{d} \), \( \tau^+ \tau^- \), \( \mu^+ \mu^- \), and \( e^+ e^- \). All these fermions have masses less than 3 GeV, making this option correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed because the top quark is far too heavy (\( 173 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \)). Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed for the same reason as in Option A. Incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decay modes of the boson \( X \) based on the given mass constraints.
