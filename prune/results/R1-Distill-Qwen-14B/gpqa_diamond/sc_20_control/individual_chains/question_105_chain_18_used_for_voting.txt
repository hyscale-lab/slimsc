Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again and break it down step by step.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, but with some spots on it. The star's radius is the same as the Sun's. One hemisphere is covered with dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler—1000 K difference, so 5000 K. Because the star is rotating, these spots come into and out of view from our perspective, causing the star's brightness to vary over time. The interesting part is that this brightness variation can look similar to the dip in brightness caused by an exoplanet transiting in front of the star.

The question is asking, if instead of spots, there was an exoplanet causing the same brightness variation (same amplitude in the light curve), what would be the radius of the planet relative to the star? The options are A to D.

Hmm. So I need to find Rpl/Rstar such that the light curve's dip (the amplitude) is the same whether it's due to a planet or the spots. But wait, the spots are on the star, so the variation is a bit different than a planet's transit.

Let me think about how each phenomenon affects the observed brightness.

First, the transit method for exoplanets: when a planet passes in front of the star, it blocks some of the star's light. The dip in brightness (the amplitude) depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. The formula for the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2, because the area scales with the square of the radius.

Now, what about the star with spots? The spots are cooler, so when they're facing us, the star appears dimmer than when the spots are on the far side. As the star rotates, more or less of the spotted hemisphere comes into view, causing a periodic change in brightness.

So the effective brightness change depends on the area of the spots relative to the star's surface. But wait, the problem says the spots have a filling factor of 20%. Filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere that's covered by spots. So if the star is a sphere, but only one hemisphere is being considered, the total area of the spots would be 20% of half the star's surface. Wait, no, filling factor is the fraction of the visible surface covered by spots. Let me think: for a hemisphere, the total area is (4πR²)/2 = 2πR². The filling factor is 20%, so the spotted area is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

But wait, does the rotational modulation (the change in brightness as spots rotate) depend on how much of the spotted area is moving in and out of view? Alternatively, perhaps the maximum change in brightness would be the difference between when the spots are on the near side and the far side. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe the variation is due to the spots being on the limb or the center.

Wait, perhaps the brightness variation is caused by the spots moving into and out of view as the star rotates. The spots are on one hemisphere, so as the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go out of view, causing the brightness to go down and then back up. The amplitude of this variation would depend on the area of the spots as a fraction of the star's surface.

Wait, but the star's brightness also depends on the temperature of the spots. Because the spots are cooler, when they are on the near side, the star's total brightness is lower than when they are on the far side. So when the spots are visible, the star is dimmer, and when they're not, it's brighter.

So the net change in brightness would be the difference between the star when spots are visible and when they aren't. The key is to compute the maximum change in flux as the spots rotate.

Let me think about flux. The total flux from the star is the sum of the flux from the spotted regions and the rest of the star.

The star's total flux without any spots is F0 = 4πR² * σTeff^4.

When the spots are visible, the flux is F = (F0 - F_spots + F_unspotted). Wait, no. The star's surface is a mix of spotted and unspotted regions. So the flux is the sum of the flux from the unspotted areas and the spotted areas.

The unspotted area has a higher temperature (6000 K), and the spotted area is 5000 K.

Wait, no, the star's overall Teff is 6000 K. So when spots are present, the average flux is the sum of the flux from the unspotted regions and the spotted regions.

The total flux when spots are on the near side would be:

F = (1 - f) * F_unspotted + f * F_spotted,

where f is the filling factor (20%), and F_unspotted is the flux per unit area from the non-spotted regions, and F_spotted is the flux per unit area from the spots.

Wait, actually, the flux from a surface area element is F = σ T^4, where T is the temperature of that area.

So the total flux when the spots are visible would be:

F_visible = (1 - f) * σ (Teff)^4 * A_unspotted + f * σ (T_spot)^4 * A_spotted.

But wait, the area is the same for each part, because it's the same surface area. Wait, no—each unit area contributes σ T^4 to the flux.

Wait, but A_unspotted is (1-f) times the area of the hemisphere, and A_spotted is f times the hemisphere area. But the hemisphere is half the star's surface, so the total area of the hemisphere is 2π R². So the total area of the star is 4π R², but only half is being considered as the hemisphere (the other hemisphere is spot-free, perhaps? Or maybe the spots are only on one hemisphere, so the other hemisphere has no spots.)

Wait, the problem says one hemisphere is covered. So the other hemisphere is unspotted. Wait, but in reality, when the star rotates, only the spotted hemisphere would be visible as it comes into view. Or maybe the entire star is observed, but when the star rotates, the spots on one hemisphere come into and out of view. Hmm, perhaps I should model the brightness variation when the spots are on the limb versus the center.

Wait, perhaps the variation in brightness is caused by the spots moving across the star's disk as seen from Earth, but since the spots are on one hemisphere, the brightness changes as the spot area moves in and out of view. But this might complicate the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplifying it by considering the maximum and minimum brightness when the spot is in front (maximum dimming) and when it's behind (no dimming). But the star is rotating, so the brightness fluctuates as the spots become visible and then hidden.

Wait, but the problem says that the star has a radius equal to the Sun's, and one hemisphere is covered in spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler, so 5000 K.

The question is, if the same amplitude in the light curve is produced by a planet's transit, what would be the planet's radius relative to the star?

So, the observed brightness variation is due to the spots, but the same variation would be caused by a planet blocking some of the star's light.

Wait, but the problem says that the situation can "closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet." So the key is to compute the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots, then find the planet's radius that would cause the same amplitude.

So first, compute the amplitude of the variation due to the spots, then compute the planet's radius needed to cause the same dip.

So, let me first compute the fractional change in brightness when the star is spotted.

Without spots, the star emits a certain amount of flux. When the spots are on the near side, the flux decreases because the spots are cooler.

But wait, the star's entire surface is not spots. Only a fraction is. So the total flux when spots are visible is:

F_visible = (1 - f) * F_unspotted + f * F_spotted,

where f is the filling factor (0.2), F_unspotted is the flux per unit area from the unspotted regions (σ * (6000)^4 ), and F_spotted is the flux from the spots (σ * (5000)^4 ).

Wait, but the entire star's surface is 4π R², but only the hemisphere (2π R²) is being considered as the spotty region. Or is the filling factor applied to the entire star? Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Wait, the filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere. So the area covered by spots is 0.2 * (2π R²) = 0.4 π R².

So the total flux from the star when the spotty hemisphere is visible is:

F = [ (2π R² - 0.4 π R²) * σ (6000)^4 ) + (0.4 π R²) * σ (5000)^4 ) ] / (4π R²) )

Wait, because the entire surface area is 4π R². So when the spotty hemisphere (2π R²) is being observed, the flux from that side is:

( (2π R² - 0.4 π R²) * σ * (6000)^4 ) + (0.4 π R² * σ * (5000)^4 ) )

But wait, when the star is not rotating, we would see all of the spotty hemisphere. But when it's rotating, the spots come into and out of view. Hmm, perhaps it's a different approach.

Alternatively, maybe the maximum and minimum fluxes are when the spots are fully visible or fully hidden. Since the star is rotating, the spots come into view and then go out, but for the purpose of calculating the amplitude, we can consider the difference in flux between when the spots are visible and when they're not.

Wait, when the star is not spotted, its flux is F0 = 4π R² σ (6000)^4.

When the spots are on the near side (visible), the flux is F_visible = ( (1 - f) * (2π R²) * σ (6000)^4 ) + (f * 2π R² * σ (5000)^4 ) ) 

But wait, this is because the spotty hemisphere is 2π R², and f is the fraction of that hemisphere covered by spots. So the area of unspotted hemisphere is (1 - f) * 2π R², and the spotted area is f * 2π R².

Wait, no, the entire star's surface is 4π R². But since only one hemisphere is spotty, the other hemisphere is completely unspotted.

But when the star is viewed such that the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux from that hemisphere is F_spotty_hemisphere = unspotted part + spotted part.

The unspotted part is (1 - f) * 2π R² * σ (6000)^4.

The spotted part is f * 2π R² * σ (5000)^4.

The other hemisphere, which is unspotted, contributes 2π R² * σ (6000)^4.

So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the total flux is:

F_visible = [ ( (1 - f) * 2π R² + 2π R² ) * σ (6000)^4 ) ] + [ f * 2π R² * σ (5000)^4 ) ]

Wait, no. Wait, the unspotted hemisphere is entirely unspotted, so it's contributing 2π R² * σ (6000)^4.

The spotty hemisphere is contributing (1-f) * 2π R² * σ (6000)^4 + f * 2π R² * σ (5000)^4.

So F_visible = [ (1-f)*2π R² + 2π R² ] * σ (6000)^4 + [ f * 2π R² ] * σ (5000)^4.

Wait, wait, no. The other hemisphere is unspotted, so its contribution is 2π R² * σ (6000)^4. The spotty hemisphere contributes (1-f)*2π R² * σ (6000)^4 + f*2π R² * σ (5000)^4.

So combining, the total F_visible is:

[2π R² * σ (6000)^4 + (1 - f) 2π R² σ (6000)^4 + f 2π R² σ (5000)^4 ].

Wait, that seems off. Let me reorganize.

Total F_visible:

= (unspotted hemisphere) + (spotty hemisphere's unspotted part) + (spotty hemisphere's spotted part)

So:

= 2π R² σ (6000)^4 (from unspotted hemisphere)
+ (1 - f) * 2π R² σ (6000)^4 (unspotted part of spotty hemisphere)
+ f * 2π R² σ (5000)^4 (spotted part)

So F_visible = [2π R² + (1-f) * 2π R² ] * σ (6000)^4 + [ f * 2π R² ] * σ (5000)^4.

Simplify:

= [ (2π R²)(1 + (1-f)) ) ] * σ (6000)^4 + [ 2π R² f ] σ (5000)^4.

Wait, 1 + (1-f) is 2 - f.

So F_visible = 2π R² (2 - f) σ (6000)^4 + 2π R² f σ (5000)^4.

Wait, but the entire star's area is 4π R², so I think I made a mistake in considering the areas. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the star's total surface area is 4π R². The unspotted hemisphere is 2π R², and the spotty hemisphere is 2π R², but within that, 20% (filling factor) is spots.

So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is:

Flux = (unspotted parts) * σ (6000)^4 + (spotted parts) * σ (5000)^4.

So unspotted parts are:

- The entire unspotted hemisphere: 2π R².

- The unspotted part of the spotty hemisphere: (1 - f) * 2π R².

Wait, no, the spotty hemisphere is 2π R², 20% of which is spots. So the unspotted part of the spotty hemisphere is (1 - f) * 2π R² * (f is 0.2, so 0.8 of 2π R² is unspotted there).

Wait, no, the filling factor is 20% of the spotty hemisphere. So the area of spots is 0.2 * 2π R².

So the spotty hemisphere contributes:

(2π R² - 0.2 * 2π R²) * σ (6000)^4 + (0.2 * 2π R²) * σ (5000)^4.

Which simplifies to:

(1.8 * 2π R²) * σ (6000)^4 + (0.2 * 2π R²) * σ (5000)^4.

The other hemisphere is unspotted and contributes 2π R² * σ (6000)^4.

So the total flux when the spotty hemisphere is facing us is:

= [1.8 * 2π R² + 2π R²] * σ (6000)^4 + 0.2 * 2π R² * σ (5000)^4.

Wait, 1.8 * 2π R² is from the spotty hemisphere's unspotted area. Plus the other hemisphere's 2π R² unspotted. So total unspotted area is (1.8 + 2) * 2π R²? Wait, no: the spotty hemisphere's unspotted part is 1.8 * 2π R²? No, wait: the spotty hemisphere is 2π R². 20% of that is spots, so 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². So the unspotted part of the spotty hemisphere is 2π R² - 0.4 π R² = 1.6 π R². Wait no, 2π R² * (1 - 0.2) = 1.6 π R². Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused with the math here.

Let me approach this differently. Let me calculate the total flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible and when it's not.

Without any spots, the flux is F0 = 4π R² σ (6000)^4.

When the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_visible = [ (1 - f) * 2π R² + (2π R² * (1 - f)) ] * σ (6000)^4 + [f * 2π R² ] * σ (5000)^4 ?

Wait, no. No, when the spotty hemisphere is visible, the entire star's flux is:

Flux from the unspotted hemisphere (2π R² * σ (6000)^4 )

Plus the flux from the spotty hemisphere:

unspotted part: (1 - f) * 2π R² * σ (6000)^4

spotted part: f * 2π R² * σ (5000)^4

So F_visible = [2π R² + (1 - f) * 2π R² ] * σ (6000)^4 + [ f * 2π R² ] σ (5000)^4.

Factor out 2π R²:

= 2π R² [ (2 - f) ) ] * σ (6000)^4 + 2π R² f * σ (5000)^4.

Wait, but the total area of the star is 4π R², so F_visible is:

F_visible = [ (2 - f) * 2π R² * σ (6000)^4 ) + (f * 2π R² * σ (5000)^4 ) ] 

But wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me compute the total area:

The unspotted hemisphere is 2π R².

The spotty hemisphere's unspotted part is (1 - f) * 2π R².

The spotty hemisphere's spotted part is f * 2π R².

So the total when the spotty hemisphere is facing us:

(2π R² [unspotted hemisphere] ) + ( (1 - f) * 2π R² [spotty's unspotted] ) + (f * 2π R² [spotty's spots] )

Wait, no, that can't be. Because when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the entire spotty hemisphere is visible, so the other hemisphere (unspotted) is not visible. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the star is a sphere. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, we see all of the spotty hemisphere and none of the other. No, wait, no. Wait, when you're looking at the star, you see the near side, which is a hemisphere. If the star is rotating, and the spots are on one hemisphere, then when that hemisphere is facing us, we see the spots. When it's rotated such that the other hemisphere (unspotted) is facing us, we don't see the spots.

Wait, no, that's not right. The star is a sphere, and when a hemisphere is facing us, the other is背. So the brightness variation occurs as the spotty hemisphere comes into view. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is lower (due to the spots), and when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is higher (as all the light comes from the hotter regions).

Wait, perhaps I should model the maximum and minimum fluxes:

Maximum flux occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us. So F_max = 2π R² * σ (6000)^4.

Minimum flux occurs when the spotty hemisphere is facing us. F_min = [ (1 - f) * 2π R² * σ (6000)^4 ) + (f * 2π R² * σ (5000)^4 ) ]

Wait, but that's not correct because the other hemisphere isn't visible. Wait, no, when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the entire hemisphere is visible. So the flux would be the sum of the unspotted parts of that hemisphere and the spotted parts.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the star as a sphere, and when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, its contribution is F_spotty_hemisphere = (1-f) * 2π R² * σ (6000)^4 + f * 2π R² * σ (5000)^4.

And when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the entire flux is F_unspotted_hemisphere = 2π R² * σ (6000)^4.

So the maximum flux is F_unspotted_hemisphere (when the unspotted side is facing us), and the minimum flux is F_spotty_hemisphere (when the spotted side is facing us).

Thus, the amplitude of the brightness variation is (F_max - F_min) / F_max.

Wait, or perhaps the average flux is (F_unspotted_hemisphere + F_spotty_hemisphere ) / 2.

Wait, no, that's if the star is rotating and we average over all phases. But the question states that the variation is caused by rotational modulation, so the star's brightness changes as the spots rotate into and out of view.

But for the purpose of this problem, perhaps the change in flux is the difference between F_unspotted_hemisphere and F_spotty_hemisphere.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation when the star is spotted is:

Amplitude_spot = (F_unspotted - F_spotty) / F_unspotted.

Wait, no. Let me think in terms of fractional change.

The fractional change in brightness when the star is spotted is:

ΔF_spot = (F_unspotted - F_spotty) / F_unspotted.

Because when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_spotty, which is less than F_unspotted.

Wait, but when the star is observed, the maximum flux is F_unspotted (when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us), and the minimum is F_spotty (when the spotty hemisphere is facing us). So the amplitude is (F_unspotted - F_spotty) / F_unspotted.

Wait, no, the amplitude is the change in flux from maximum to minimum. So the amplitude would be (F_unspotted - F_spotty) divided by the average flux.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the maximum dip. The maximum dip occurs when the spotted hemisphere is fully in view, so the flux is F_spotty. So the dip is (F_unspotted - F_spotty) / F_unspotted.

So let's compute that.

F_unspotted = 2π R² σ (6000)^4.

F_spotty = (1-f) * 2π R² σ (6000)^4 + f * 2π R² σ (5000)^4.

So,

ΔF_spot = (F_unspotted - F_spotty) / F_unspotted.

Substituting,

F_unspotted = 2π σ R² (6000)^4.

F_spotty = 2π σ R² [ (1-f) (6000)^4 + f (5000)^4 ].

So,

ΔF_spot = [ 2π σ R² (6000)^4 (1 - [ (1-f)(6000^4) + f (5000^4) ] / (6000^4) ) ] / (2π σ R² (6000^4)) )

Simplify:

ΔF_spot = 1 - [ (1-f) + f ( (5000/6000)^4 ) ]

Let me compute that.

f is 0.2.

So,

ΔF_spot = 1 - [ (0.8) + 0.2*( (5/6)^4 ) ]

Compute (5/6)^4:

5/6 is approximately 0.8333. 0.8333^4 is about 0.5006.

So,

ΔF_spot ≈ 1 - [ 0.8 + 0.2 * 0.5006 ] 

0.2 * 0.5006 ≈ 0.10012.

So,

ΔF_spot ≈ 1 - (0.8 + 0.10012) = 1 - 0.90012 = 0.09988, approximately 0.1, or 10% dip.

Wait, but that's the maximum dip when the spotted hemisphere is in view. So the amplitude is about 0.1, or 10% of the star's flux.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake in the setup. Because when the star is rotating, the spots come into view and out of view, so the brightness variation is not from the entire hemisphere but the change as spots rotate into view.

Wait, perhaps I should model it as the maximum change when a spot is in front of the star, blocking some flux. But in this case, the spots are on one hemisphere, so as the star rotates, a portion of the star's surface (with spots) is moving into and out of view.

But perhaps a simpler approach is to compute the average brightness when the spots are visible and when they're not. Alternatively, perhaps the amplitude is the fractional difference between the maximum and minimum brightness.

Alternatively, perhaps the amplitude is the difference between when the spots are on the far side (so no dip) and when they're on the near side (so dip is maximum).

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the planet case.

In the planet case, the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

So we have ΔF_planet = (Rp/Rstar)^2.

We need ΔF_spot ≈ ΔF_planet.

So, from earlier calculation, ΔF_spot ≈ 0.09988, which is around 0.1, so (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1 → Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.1) ≈ 0.316, which is roughly 0.32. Looking at the options, D is ~0.32.

Wait, but wait, in the problem statement, it says that the star has an effective temperature of 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. So perhaps the calculation I did earlier was correct, leading to a dip of about 0.0998, which is about 0.1. So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1 → Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.316, which is option D.

But wait, in the calculation, the dip was approximately 0.0998, which is about 0.1, but let me verify the calculation more precisely.

Compute (5/6)^4:

5^4 = 625; 6^4=1296.

625/1296 ≈ 0.482253.

So,

ΔF_spot = 1 - [ 0.8 + 0.2 * 0.482253 ]

= 1 - [ 0.8 + 0.09645 ]

= 1 - 0.89645 = 0.10355.

So ΔF ≈ 0.10355, or about 10.355%.

So, the dip is about 10.36% when the spotted hemisphere is in view.

So, the amplitude is approximately 0.1035.

In the planet case, the amplitude is (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035.

So,

Rp = Rstar * sqrt(0.1035) ≈ Rstar * 0.3218.

Which is approximately 0.32, matching option D.

Wait, but let me make sure. The problem says that the star's radius is the same as the Sun's. So Rstar = R_sun.

The planet's radius would be Rpl = 0.32 * R_sun.

But wait, that seems a bit large for an exoplanet. Jupiter's radius is about 0.1 R_sun. Oh, but maybe the question is about relative size, so it's acceptable.

Wait, but the way the problem is phrased, the brightness variation due to the spots is being compared to that of a planet. So according to the calculation, the planet's radius would need to be about 0.32 times the star's radius to produce the same dip.

So the correct answer is D) ~0.32.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation (amplitude) as the star with spots, we analyze the problem as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: \( R_{\text{star}} = R_{\odot} \) (same as the Sun).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of \( f = 0.2 \).
   - Spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of \( \Delta T = 1000 \, \text{K} \), so \( T_{\text{spots}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation**:
   - The star's brightness changes as the spotty hemisphere rotates into and out of view. The amplitude of this variation depends on the difference in flux between the unspotted and spotted hemispheres.

3. **Flux Calculations**:
   - The flux from a surface area element is proportional to \( \sigma T^4 \), where \( \sigma \) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.
   - When the unspotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is:
     \[
     F_{\text{unspotted}} = 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma (6000)^4
     \]
   - When the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is:
     \[
     F_{\text{spotty}} = (1 - f) \cdot 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma (6000)^4 + f \cdot 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma (5000)^4
     \]

4. **Fractional Brightness Change**:
   - The amplitude of the brightness variation is the fractional change in flux:
     \[
     \Delta F_{\text{spot}} = \frac{F_{\text{unspotted}} - F_{\text{spotty}}}{F_{\text{unspotted}}}
     \]
   - Substituting the flux expressions:
     \[
     \Delta F_{\text{spot}} = 1 - \left[ (1 - f) + f \cdot \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \right]
     \]
   - With \( f = 0.2 \) and \( \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \approx 0.4823 \):
     \[
     \Delta F_{\text{spot}} = 1 - \left[ 0.8 + 0.2 \cdot 0.4823 \right] = 1 - 0.8965 = 0.1035
     \]
   - Thus, the amplitude is approximately \( \Delta F_{\text{spot}} \approx 0.1035 \) (10.35%).

### Exoplanet Case:
The amplitude of the brightness variation caused by a planet transiting the star is given by:
\[
\Delta F_{\text{planet}} = \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2
\]
To match the amplitude of the spotted star (\( \Delta F_{\text{spot}} \approx 0.1035 \)):
\[
\left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.1035
\]
\[
\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.1035} \approx 0.3218
\]
