Okay, so I've got this question about a quasar and the comoving distance from Earth. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on cosmology, but I'll think through it.

The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at about 790 nm in the near infrared and optical spectrum. And the flux drops significantly at wavelengths shorter than that. So, what does that peak mean? Oh right, I remember something about emission lines and redshift.

Wait, I think the Lyman-alpha emission line is at 121 nm in the rest frame, which is in the ultraviolet. But if the flux drops below 790 nm, maybe that's where the Lyman-alpha line is observed. Because if the quasar is so far away, the light is redshifted. So if the observed wavelength is 790 nm, that's much longer than 121 nm. So the redshift z would be (790 / 121) - 1, right? Let me calculate that. 790 divided by 121 is approximately 6.528, so subtracting 1 gives z ≈ 5.528. So the quasar has a redshift of about 5.5.

Now, the question is about the comoving distance at scale factor a=1, which I think is the current universe. The comoving distance relates to how far away the quasar is from us, considering the expansion of the universe. The options are all in gigaparsecs, so I'll need to calculate that.

The given cosmological parameters are H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, matter density Omega_m = 0.3, dark energy Omega_lambda = 0.7, and the universe is flat (Omega_total = 1). To find the comoving distance, I'd use the formula involving the integral of 1/(H(a)) da from a=0 to a=1, but wait, isn't the comoving distance D_C = (c/H0) * ∫(from 0 to z) dz' / E(z'), where E(z) = sqrt(Omega_m*(1+z)^3 + Omega_lambda). Oh right, because for a flat universe, Omega_r is negligible at high z, so we can ignore that.

So, E(z) = sqrt( (0.3)(1 + z)^3 + 0.7 ) = sqrt( 0.3(1+z)^3 + 0.7 )

The integral is from 0 to z of dz' / E(z'). Let me note down the integral formula:

∫(from 0 to z) [1 / sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 + 0.7)] dz'

This integral gives the value when multiplied by c/H0 to get the comoving distance. But wait, I don't remember exact values for this integral. Maybe I can approximate it or remember some standard values.

I recall that for z around 5, the integral might be around 1.5 or so. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for approximate comoving distance formulas or use an approximation for E(z). Alternatively, maybe I can use the lookback time or other relations, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I can think about the relation between redshift and comoving distance. For high redshifts, the comoving distance increases with z, but the exact relation depends on the cosmology.

Wait, another approach: using online calculators or standard formulae. But since I can't look that up, I'll have to try to compute it or remember approximate values.

I remember that for a flat universe with Omega_m = 0.3 and Omega_lambda=0.7, the comoving distance at z=5 is approximately 15 Gpc. Wait, but wait, that's using H0=70, right? Let me check.

Alternatively, let me compute the integrals numerically. Since that's complicated, maybe I can use a simple approximation or break the integral into parts.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation formula for the integral. Let me think. The integral ∫0^z dz' / sqrt(Ωm (1+z')³ + Ωλ) 

At high z, the matter term dominates because (1+z)^3 is much larger than the dark energy term which is constant. So for a high z like 5.5, perhaps the integrand is roughly 1/sqrt(0.3 (1+z')^3). So the integral becomes ∫0^z dz' / sqrt(0.3 (1+z')^3) = 1/sqrt(0.3) ∫0^z dz' (1+z')^(-3/2) )

Let me compute that. The integral of (1+z')^(-3/2) dz' is ∫ (1+z')^(-3/2) dz' = -2 (1+z')^(-1/2) + C

So the definite integral from 0 to z is -2 [ (1+z)^(-1/2) - 1 ] = 2 [1 - 1/sqrt(1+z) ]

So the integral becomes (1/sqrt(0.3)) * 2 [1 - 1/sqrt(1+z) ]

At z=5.5, 1+z=6.5. sqrt(6.5) is approximately 2.55. So [1 - 1/2.55] ≈ 1 - 0.392 = 0.608.

So the integral is (1/sqrt(0.3)) * 2 * 0.608.

sqrt(0.3) ≈ 0.5477. So 1/0.5477 ≈ 1.826.

So 1.826 * 2 * 0.608 ≈ 2.23 * 0.608 ≈ 1.357 approximately.

But wait, this is an approximation where I assumed that the dark energy term is negligible, which might not be the case for z=5.5, since dark energy's effect becomes more important at lower redshifts, but at z=5.5, matter dominates. So perhaps this approximation is better than the exact integral.

So the integral is approximately 1.357.

Then, the comoving distance D_C is (c / H0) * integral.

But wait, c is the speed of light, and H0 in s^-1, so the units will work out.

Wait, c is about 3e5 km/s, and H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc.

So c/H0 = (3e5) /70 Mpc ≈ 4285.7 Mpc ≈ 4.286 Gpc.

Multiply that by the integral value, which is around 1.357.

So D_C ≈ 4.286 * 1.357 ≈ let's compute that.

4 *1.357 =5.428, 0.286 *1.357 ≈ 0.388. So total is about 5.428+0.388=5.816 Gpc.

Wait, that's about 5.8 Gpc. But the options are 6,7,8,9 Gpc. So why is that?

Hmm, perhaps my approximation isn't accurate enough for z=5.5.

Wait, because at z=5.5, the dark energy term might start to have some effect. Let me think, for E(z)=sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3 + 0.7). At z=5.5, (1+z)=6.5, so (z+1)^3=276.7. 0.3 * 276.7 = 83.02, plus 0.7 gives 83.72. The square root of that is about 9.15. So 1/E(z)=1/9.15≈0.109.

But earlier, in the approximation, I ignored the dark energy term, so the integrand was 1/(sqrt(0.3*(z+1)^3)) which is about 0.109. So, my previous approach may have overestimated the integral.

Wait, but wait, the integral I did earlier assumed that E(z) ≈ sqrt(0.3*(z+1)^3), which is correct in the matter-dominated era. But for z=5.5, dark energy is becoming less important, but perhaps not negligible?

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach would be to compute the integral more accurately, but I don't remember the exact value. Alternatively, maybe I can think about standard cosmology values.

Wait, another approach: look up the age of the universe or comoving distance at high z. Wait, I think for the standard cosmology (Omega_m=0.3, Omega_lambda=0.7, flat), the comoving distance at z=5 is about 15 Gpc. Wait, but that's using H0=70. Wait, now I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, I think maybe I'm mixing up the lookback time and comoving distance. Let me think again.

Wait, the formula I have is D_C = (c/H0) * ∫0^z dz' / E(z').

Wait, suppose H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc. So c/H0 is 3e5 km/s / 70 km/s/Mpc = 3e5 /70 = approximately 4285.7 Mpc. So about 4.286 Gpc.

So if the integral is 1.357, then D_C is 4.286 *1.357 ≈ 5.8 Gpc.

But wait, wait, I'm getting 5.8 Gpc, but the options are 6, 7, 8, 9.

But why is my calculation giving about 5.8 Gpc, which is not one of the options. The closest option is 6 Gpc (option A). But my approximation might not be accurate enough. Maybe the integral is larger.

Let me check another way. Perhaps I can use the fact that for a matter-dominated universe (Omega_m=1), the comoving distance for a given z is (c/H0) * (2/sqrt(3)) (sqrt(1+z) -1). But in our case, Omega_m is 0.3, which is less than 1, so the universe is dark energy dominated at lower z, but matter dominated at high z.

Alternatively, perhaps using a better approximation for the integral. Because the integrand is 1/sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 + 0.7), and for z=5.5.

Alternatively, perhaps using a better approach. Let me think: the integral from 0 to z=5.5 of dz' / sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 + 0.7)

Let me break this into parts. Let me compute this integral numerically, but I can’t do exact integration here. Let me compute at a few points and approximate.

But that's time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation that for high z where matter dominates, E(z) ≈ (0.3)^0.5 (1+z)^(3/2). So, 1/E(z) ≈ 1/(sqrt(0.3) (1+z)^{3/2})

So the integral becomes ∫0^z [1/(sqrt(0.3) (1+z')^{3/2})] dz'

Which is (1/sqrt(0.3)) ∫ (1+z')^(-3/2) dz' from 0 to z.

The integral of (1+z')^(-3/2) dz' is as I did before, which gives 2 [1 - 1/sqrt(1+z)] / sqrt(0.3).

Wait, but this approach only accounts for matter and ignores dark energy. So perhaps the actual integrand is a bit less than this approximation. Because when dark energy is not zero, the denominator is a bit larger, so the integrand is a bit smaller. So the actual integral would be less than the matter-only case.

So in the matter-only case, the integral is 1.357 as calculated earlier, but in reality, it's a bit less. So the comoving distance would be a bit less than 5.8 Gpc.

But the options are 6,7,8,9 Gpc. So perhaps my approach is wrong. Maybe I should think about the luminosity distance instead, but the question is about comoving distance.

Wait, another thought: the peak at 790 nm is the Lyman-alpha emission line. So assuming that this is the rest frame, but perhaps it's redshifted.

Wait, wait, no. The observed wavelength is 790 nm. The rest frame wavelength for Lyman-alpha is 121 nm. So the redshift z is (observed wavelength) / (rest wavelength) - 1.

So z = 790 / 121 - 1. Let me calculate that.

790 divided by 121 is about 6.5289. So subtracting 1 gives z ≈5.5289.

So z=5.5289.

Now, the comoving distance Dc is (c/H0) * ∫0^z dz' / E(z').

I think to compute this integral more accurately, I can use an online calculator or a table, but since I can't, I'll try to recall any possible approximations. Alternatively, I can consider that for z=5, the comoving distance is about 15 Gpc, but that was for H0=70 and a different cosmology.

Wait, no. Let me see, the standard formula for the comoving distance is:

Dc = (c / H0) * ∫0^z [1 / sqrt(Ωm (1+z')^3 + Ωλ)] dz'

For the given cosmology (Ωm=0.3, Ωλ=0.7), let me think about the approximate value of the integral at z=5.5.

Another approach: using the approximation method for the integral.

We can split the integral into a few intervals and approximate using the trapezoidal rule or Simpson's rule.

Let me try dividing the interval [0,5.5] into, say, 10 steps, but that's time-consuming but manageable.

Wait, let's compute the integrand at several points:

z=0: E= sqrt(0.3*1 + 0.7) = sqrt(1) =1. So integrand =1.

z=1: E= sqrt(0.3*(8) +0.7)= sqrt(2.4 +0.7)=sqrt(3.1)=≈1.76. integrand≈0.568.

z=2: 0.3*(27)=8.1 +0.7=8.8. sqrt(8.8)=2.966. integrand≈0.337.

z=3: 0.3*(64)=19.2 +0.7=19.9. sqrt≈4.461. integrand≈0.224.

z=4: 0.3*(125)=37.5 +0.7=38.2. sqrt≈6.18. integrand≈0.1617.

z=5: 0.3*(216)=64.8 +0.7=65.5. sqrt≈8.09. integrand≈0.124.

z=5.5: 0.3*(5.5+1)^3=0.3*(6.5)^3=0.3*274.625=82.3875. +0.7=83.0875. sqrt≈9.115. integrand≈0.1097.

Now, let's use the trapezoidal rule with intervals at z=0,1,2,3,4,5,5.5.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use a larger number of steps. Alternatively, let's make intervals every 0.5:

Wait, perhaps I should compute the integrand at z=0, 1, 2, 3,4,5,5.5:

Wait, let's list the integrand at each z:

z=0 →1

z=1→0.568

z=2→0.337

z=3→0.224

z=4→0.1617

z=5→0.124

z=5.5→0.1097

Now, let's use the trapezoidal rule with these points, assuming equal spacing between them. Wait, but the intervals are not equal. From 0 to1:1 unit. 1 to 2:1 unit. 2-3, same. 4-5, same. 5-5.5: 0.5.

But trapezoidal rule requires equal intervals, so perhaps I should choose points with equal spacing, like every 0.5.

Alternatively, perhaps I can approximate using the midpoint method.

Alternatively, let's use the trapezoidal rule between each pair of points.

Compute the integral as the sum of the trapezoid areas between each consecutive z.

So the integral is approximately:

sum from i=1 to n of (z_i - z_{i-1}) * (f(z_i) + f(z_{i-1}))/2

So let's compute for the points 0,1,2,3,4,5,5.5.

The intervals are:

0 to1: delta_z=1

1 to2: delta_z=1

2 to3: delta_z=1

3 to4: delta_z=1

4 to5: delta_z=1

5 to5.5: delta_z=0.5

So, compute each trapezoid:

Between 0 and1:

(1-0)*(1 +0.568)/2 = 1*(1.568)/2 =0.784

Between 1 and2:

1*(0.568 +0.337)/2 = (0.905)/2=0.4525

Between 2 and3:

1*(0.337 +0.224)/2=0.561/2=0.2805

Between 3 and4:

1*(0.224 +0.1617)/2=0.3857/2=0.19285

Between 4 and5:

1*(0.1617 +0.124)/2=0.2857/2=0.14285

Between 5 and5.5:

0.5*(0.124 +0.1097)/2=0.5*(0.2337)/2=0.5 *0.11685=0.058425

Now sum all these:

0.784 +0.4525 = 1.2365

+0.2805 →1.517

+0.19285→1.70985

+0.14285 →1.8527

+0.058425 →1.911125

So the approximate integral is about 1.911.

Wait, but this is using the trapezoidal rule with 6 intervals. But the actual function decreases more rapidly than a straight line, so perhaps the trapezoidal rule overestimates the integral. Or maybe not? Because the function is convex, the trapezoidal rule might overestimate the area. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approximation is needed, but I'm getting an integral of around 1.91.

So Dc = (c/H0) * integral ≈4.286 Gpc *1.91 ≈8.21 Gpc.

Wait, that's about 8 Gpc, which would match option B (8 Gpc).

But wait, earlier when I used the high-z approximation, I got 5.8 Gpc, but that was ignoring dark energy, and perhaps the method with trapezoidal gives a larger integral. Now, with the trapezoidal method, the integral is about 1.91, so Dc≈8.2 Gpc.

Looking at the options, option B is 8 Gpc, which is close.

Alternatively, maybe my trapezoidal approximation isn't accurate enough. Let me think, maybe I can compute more points.

But perhaps I can remember that for z=5, the integral is roughly 1.76, leading to Dc= around 7.5 Gpc (4.286 *1.76 ≈7.53 Gpc). But wait, I'm getting conflicting estimates.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a better approximation. I found a paper or online source that provides the exact integration for these cosmological parameters.

Wait, I recall that for a flat universe with Omega_m=0.3, Omega_lambda=0.7, the comoving distance at z=5 is approximately 15 Gly (gigalight-years), which translates to about 4.7 Gpc because 1 Gly ≈ 3.262 parsec, so 15 Gly *3.262 pc/Gly = 48.9 pc, which is 48.9 Mpc, 0.489 Gpc. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, wait, no: 1 Gly = 3.262 Gpc (since 1 pc is ~3.26 light-years, so 1 Gpc is ~3.26 billion light-years). Oh right, I think I made a mistake in unit conversion.

Wait, 1 parsec (pc) is about 3.26 light-years. So 1 megaparsec (Mpc) is 1 million pc, which is about 3.26 million light-years.

1 gigaparsec (Gpc) is 1 billion Mpc, so 3.26 billion light-years.

So, if the comoving distance is 15 Gly, that's 15 billion light-years, which is approximately 4.6 Gpc (since 1 Gly = ~3.26 Mpc, so 15 Gly ×3.26 Mpc/Gly =48.9 Mpc =0.0489 Gpc. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, wait: 1 Gly = 3.26 Mpc. So 15 Gly = 15 *3.26 Mpc =48.9 Mpc, which is 0.0489 Gpc. That's way too small. So that can't be right.

Hmm, maybe I confused Gpc with Gly. Let me double-check.

Wait, no, perhaps the integral itself gives a value in the same units as (c/H0). So perhaps for z=5.5, the integral is about 1.905, leading to Dc=4.286 * 1.905 ≈ 8.17 Gpc.

Which is close to option B (8 Gpc).

Alternatively, perhaps the correct integral at z=5.5 is about 1.95, giving Dc= 4.286 *1.95≈8.36 Gpc.

So the answer would be option B:8 Gpc.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought for high z, the comoving distance at z=5 is about 15 Gpc in a matter-only universe, but in this case, with dark energy, the expansion is faster, making the universe younger and distances shorter. So maybe the comoving distance is less than the matter-only case.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the age of the universe. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use an online cosmology calculator. But since I can't, I'll go with my trapezoidal approximation, which gave me about 8.2 Gpc, which is option B (8 Gpc).


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the comoving distance of a quasar with a redshift \( z \approx 5.528 \) in a universe defined by the Lambda-CDM model, where the Hubble constant \( H_0 = 70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc} \), matter density parameter \( \Omega_m = 0.3 \), dark energy density parameter \( \Omega_\lambda = 0.7 \), and the universe is flat (\( \Omega_{\text{total}} = 1 \)).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Redshift Calculation**:  
   The observed wavelength of the Lyman-alpha emission line is \( 790 \, \text{nm} \), and its rest wavelength is \( 121 \, \text{nm} \). Using the formula for redshift:  
   \[
   z = \frac{\lambda_{\text{observed}}}{\lambda_{\text{rest}}} - 1 = \frac{790}{121} - 1 \approx 5.528.
   \]

2. **Comoving Distance Formula**:  
   The comoving distance \( D_C \) is given by:  
   \[
   D_C = \frac{c}{H_0} \int_0^z \frac{dz'}{\sqrt{\Omega_m (1+z')^3 + \Omega_\lambda}},
   \]  
   where \( c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s} \), \( H_0 = 70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc} \), and \( \frac{c}{H_0} \approx 4.286 \, \text{Gpc} \).

3. **Integral Approximation**:  
   The integral \( \int_0^z \frac{dz'}{\sqrt{\Omega_m (1+z')^3 + \Omega_\lambda}} \) was approximated using the trapezoidal rule with sample points at \( z = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5.5 \). The integrand was computed at these points, and the integral was approximated to be \( \approx 1.91 \).

4. **Final Comoving Distance**:  
   Substituting the integral value into the formula:  
   \[
   D_C = 4.286 \, \text{Gpc} \times 1.91 \approx 8.2 \, \text{Gpc}.
   \]

5. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The closest option to the calculated comoving distance is \( 8 \, \text{Gpc} \) (Option B).

### Conclusion:
The comoving distance of the quasar from Earth is approximately \( 8 \, \text{Gpc} \), consistent with the given cosmological parameters and the redshift of \( z \approx 5.528 \).

Answer: B
