Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when three different solutions are mixed. Hmm, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is usually about the heat released when an acid reacts with a base. But wait, the problem gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Hmm, I need to figure out how these would react when mixed.

Wait, I think when an acid and a base are mixed, they undergo a neutralization reaction. But here, there are two acids (HCl and H2SO4) and a base (Ba(OH)2). That's a bit confusing. Or maybe I need to think about the possible reactions between them. Oh, but wait, if we mix them all together, perhaps the acids will react with the base.

Let me think about the molarity and volumes. HCl is 0.2 M in 500 mL, so moles of HCl would be 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. H2SO4 is 0.3 M in 300 mL, so 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. And Ba(OH)2 is 0.5 M in 200 mL, so 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. 

Wait, H2SO4 is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Each H2SO4 gives 2 H+ ions, right? So 0.09 moles would give 0.18 moles of H+. HCl is also a strong acid, giving 1 mole of H+ per mole. So 0.1 moles of HCl gives 0.1 moles H+. So total H+ from both acids is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now the base is Ba(OH)2. It dissociates into Ba^2+ and OH^- ions. Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- ions. So 0.1 moles would give 0.2 moles of OH-.

Wait, in neutralization, H+ reacts with OH- to form water. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So the limiting reagent here would determine how much neutralization occurs.

So how many H+ and OH- do we have?

H+ total: 0.28 moles. OH-: 0.2 moles.

So OH- is the limiting reagent. Because 0.2 < 0.28. So all the OH- will react, leaving some H+ unreacted.

So the amount of H+ that reacts is 0.2 moles. The moles of H2O formed would be 0.2.

Wait, but neutralization is exothermic, and the enthalpy change is usually per mole of H+ reacting. I think the standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is about -57 kJ/mol or so, but I'm not exactly sure of the value given in the problem. Wait, the options are in kcal and kJ. Hmm.

Wait, the standard enthalpy for neutralization is about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-), right? Because for a strong acid and strong base, each mole of H+ gives around that. So if I have 0.2 moles reacting, the enthalpy would be 0.2 * (-57) kJ, which is -11.4 kJ. Let me check the options.

Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is a bit higher. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is in kcal. Wait, but the reaction I did was based on kJ. Wait, the question is about enthalpy of neutralization, which is per mole of acid or base. Wait, maybe I should be careful with the units.

Wait, another approach: the total moles of H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So the neutralization will consume 0.2 moles of H+ (since OH- is 0.2). So the heat released is 0.2 moles * enthalpy per mole.

But what is the enthalpy value? The standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and strong bases is approximately -57.3 kJ per mole of H2O formed, or per mole of H+ neutralized. Because each mole of H+ reacting with OH- gives one mole of water, which releases about 57 kJ.

So 0.2 moles would be 0.2 * (-57.3 kJ) = -11.46 kJ. Let me look at the options. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about the same number but in kcal. Wait, but the options have D as -16.0 kJ, which is larger. Hmm. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the stoichiometry more carefully. Let me recheck the moles.

HCl: 500 mL is 0.5 L, 0.2 M → 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4 is 300 mL (0.3 L), 0.3 M → 0.09 moles H2SO4 → 0.18 moles H+.

Total H+ = 0.28 moles.

Ba(OH)2 is 0.5 M * 0.2 L → 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 moles OH-.

So reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. Limiting reagent is OH- (0.2 moles), so 0.2 moles H+ will react.

Thus, the heat released would be 0.2 * (ΔH per mole).

Assuming ΔH is -57.3 kJ per mole for each H+ neutralized.

So 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ. Looking at the options, that's close to option B, which is -11.42 kcal, but that's in kcal. Hmm, wait, the options have D as -16.0 kJ, which doesn't fit, but option B is in kcal. Oh wait, the given options are a mix of kJ and kcal which is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the question is using calories instead of kilojoules? Wait, 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ. So if the enthalpy is -11.42 kcal, that would be around -11.42 *4.184 ≈ 47.7 kJ. That doesn't fit. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing the units.

Wait, maybe I should re-calculate the moles again. Wait, let me consider that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so each mole gives 2 H+. So 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles H2SO4 → 0.18 moles H+.

HCl is 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles → 0.1 moles H+.

Total H+ is 0.28.

Ba(OH)2 is 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles → 2 * 0.1 = 0.2 moles OH-.

So moles reacting: 0.2 H+ and 0.2 OH-.

So neutralization produces 0.2 moles H2O, releasing 0.2 * 57.3 kJ = 11.46 kJ, but negative because it's exothermic. So -11.46 kJ.

Looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is roughly the same magnitude. Oh wait, but -11.42 kcal is approximately -47.8 kJ. Wait, that doesn't match. So option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher than what I calculated.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the moles of H+ and OH-.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 is different. Because H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, perhaps the neutralization is more complex.

Wait, the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 would be:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2H2O.

Wait, but in this case, the stoichiometry is 1:1 for H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2. Each H2SO4 gives 2 H+, each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-.

Wait, but in the problem, we have excess of H+ from HCl and H2SO4. So perhaps the first step is the neutralization of H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, followed by any remaining H+ from HCl reacting with the leftover OH-.

Alternatively, perhaps all the H+ from all sources will try to react with OH- from Ba(OH)2.

But I think the initial approach was correct: total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2, so 0.2 moles H+ reacts with 0.2 OH- to form 0.2 H2O, releasing 0.2 * 57.3 kJ = -11.46 kJ.

But looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is more. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of H2O, which would be 57.3 kJ per mole. So 0.2 moles would be 11.46 kJ. But none of the options match exactly. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -47.9 kJ, which is four times higher. That doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the total enthalpy change, considering all possible reactions. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility is that the H2SO4 is reacting with Ba(OH)2, and the HCl is also reacting with the remaining OH-.

So let's split it into two parts.

First, neutralization of H2SO4 with Ba(OH)2.

Moles of H2SO4: 0.09 moles.

Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.1 moles.

The reaction is H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

Each mole of H2SO4 reacts with one mole of Ba(OH)2. So H2SO4 is 0.09, Ba(OH)2 is 0.1. So H2SO4 is the limiting reagent.

So 0.09 moles of H2SO4 will react, producing 0.09 moles of BaSO4 and 0.18 moles of H2O.

This reaction would release 0.09 moles * 57.3 kJ = 5.157 kJ.

Then, the remaining H+ comes from HCl (0.1 moles) and the excess Ba(OH)2.

Wait, after the reaction, Ba(OH)2 has 0.1 - 0.09 = 0.01 moles left. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.02 moles OH-.

But wait, the HCl has 0.1 moles H+.

So the H+ from HCl is 0.1, OH- is 0.02.

So H+ and OH- will react again:

H+ + OH- → H2O.

Moles reacting: 0.02 moles (OH- is the limiting).

So that's another 0.02 moles of H2O, releasing 0.02 *57.3= 1.146 kJ.

Total enthalpy would be 5.157 +1.146=6.303 kJ, which is about 6.3 kJ. But that's positive, but wait, the reaction is exothermic, so it's negative. So total is -6.3 kJ. But none of the options match that.

Alternatively, perhaps the neutralization is considering all the H+ first.

Wait, perhaps the H2SO4 and HCl contribute their H+ to the solution, and the Ba(OH)2 contributes OH-.

So the total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2.

All 0.2 OH- will react, consuming 0.2 H+, leaving 0.08 H+.

So total neutralization is 0.2 moles, releasing 0.2 *57.3=11.46 kJ.

So the correct answer would be approximately -11.46 kJ.

Wait, looking back at the options:

A) -2.72 kcal ≈ -11.4 kJ (since 1 kcal ≈4.184 kJ, 2.72 *4.184 ≈11.4). So A is about -11.4 kJ.

But option A is -2.72 kcal, which is about -11.4 kJ. So the correct answer would be either A or B. Wait, but option B is -11.42 kcal. Which would be much larger.

Wait, but the question asks for enthalpy of neutralization, which is per mole of reaction. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the total enthalpy change, so -11.46 kJ, which is approximately -11.46 kJ. Among the options, D is -16.0 kJ, which is larger, and option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -47.8 kJ, which is way bigger than our calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles calculation. Let me recalculate the moles.

HCl: 0.2 M, 0.5 L → 0.2 *0.5=0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M, 0.3 L → 0.09 moles H2SO4 → each gives 2 H+, so 0.18 moles H+.

Total H+: 0.28.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M, 0.2 L → 0.1 moles → each gives 2 OH- → 0.2 moles.

So the neutralization is 0.2 moles H+ and 0.2 OH- reacting.

So total enthalpy is 0.2 *57.3=11.46 kJ, negative → -11.46 kJ.

Looking again at the options:

A) -2.72 kcal ≈-11.46 kJ (since 2.72 *4.184=11.46).

So option A is -2.72 kcal, which is approximately -11.46 kJ.

But wait, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is -11.42 *4.184≈47.7 kJ, which is way higher than our calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the answer in kcal, not kJ.

Wait, the options have both units. So if the calculation is -11.46 kJ, and option A is -2.72 kcal, which is about -11.46 kJ, then option A is correct. But looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is much larger, so that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the molarity calculations. Let me recalculate all the moles.

HCl: 0.2 M *0.5 L =0.1 moles.

H2SO4:0.3 M *0.3 L=0.09 moles. Each gives 2 H+, so 0.18.

Total H+ is 0.28.

Ba(OH)2:0.5 M *0.2 L=0.1 moles. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2.

So, 0.2 moles H+ reacting, so 0.2 *57.3=11.46 kJ.

So the answer would be approximately -11.46 kJ. Among the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is larger than our value. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the H2SO4 is a diprotic acid and the Ba(OH)2 is a base that can react with both H+ ions. So when H2SO4 reacts with Ba(OH)2, each mole of H2SO4 requires 2 moles of Ba(OH)2, but that's not the case here because Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- per mole.

Wait, wait, the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 is:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

Each mole of H2SO4 reacts with one mole of Ba(OH)2, producing 2 moles of H2O.

So the moles of H2SO4 is 0.09, Ba(OH)2 is 0.1. So H2SO4 is limiting (0.09 <0.1). So all 0.09 moles of H2SO4 will react.

So this reaction will produce 0.18 moles of H2O, releasing 0.09 *57.3 kJ *2? Wait, no, each mole of H2SO4 produces 2 moles of H2O. Each mole of H2O releases 57.3 kJ? Or per mole of reaction?

Wait, the enthalpy of neutralization per mole of H2O is 57.3 kJ. So each mole of H2O formed releases 57.3 kJ.

In this reaction, 0.09 moles of H2SO4 produce 0.18 moles of H2O. So the heat released is 0.18 *57.3=10.314 kJ.

After this reaction, the remaining Ba(OH)2 is 0.1-0.09=0.01 moles. Each gives 2 OH- →0.02 moles OH-.

Now, the remaining H+ comes from HCl: 0.1 moles.

So the OH- is 0.02 moles. So H+ will react with OH-:

0.02 moles H+ (since OH- is 0.02) → 0.02 moles H2O, releasing 0.02 *57.3=1.146 kJ.

Total enthalpy released: 10.314 +1.146=11.46 kJ → -11.46 kJ.

Looking at the options again, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is approximately -11.4 kJ, because 2.72 kcal *4.184≈11.46 kJ.

So the correct answer should be option A.

Wait, but option B is -11.42 kcal, which is way larger, about -47.8 kJ. So perhaps there's a confusion in the units.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the answer in kcal for the total neutralization, but that doesn't seem right because the standard enthalpy is usually in kJ.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the enthalpy per mole is different, but I think 57.3 kJ is correct for strong acid and strong base.

Wait, wait, let me check the molarities again.

HCl is 0.2 M, volume 500 mL (0.5 L) → 0.2 *0.5 =0.1 moles.

H2SO4 is 0.3 M * 0.3 L=0.09 moles.

Ba(OH)2 is 0.5 M *0.2 L=0.1 moles.

So yes, H+ from HCl and H2SO4 is 0.1 +0.18=0.28. OH- is 0.2.

So all OH- is consumed, 0.2 moles, releasing 0.2*57.3=11.46 kJ.

So the correct answer is -11.46 kJ, which in kcal is approximately -2.72 kcal (since 11.46 /4.184≈2.737 kcal). So option A is -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but the options for A is -2.72 kcal, which is about 11.46 kJ. So the correct option would be A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are performed:

### Step 1: Calculate moles of H⁺ and OH⁻
1. **HCl (strong acid):**  
   Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).  
   Each mole of HCl contributes 1 mole of H⁺, so moles of H⁺ from HCl = \( 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).

2. **H₂SO₄ (strong acid, diprotic):**  
   Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{moles} \).  
   Each mole of H₂SO₄ contributes 2 moles of H⁺, so moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄ = \( 0.18 \, \text{moles} \).

3. **Total H⁺ from acids:**  
   \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{moles} \).

4. **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**  
   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).  
   Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ contributes 2 moles of OH⁻, so moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.2 \, \text{moles} \).

### Step 2: Determine the limiting reagent
The reaction is \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \to \text{H₂O} \).  
The limiting reagent is the species with fewer moles. Here, \( \text{OH⁻} \) is the limiting reagent with \( 0.2 \, \text{moles} \).

### Step 3: Calculate the enthalpy change
The enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is approximately \( -57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) per mole of \( \text{H⁺} \) or \( \text{OH⁻} \).  
Since \( 0.2 \, \text{moles} \) of \( \text{OH⁻} \) reacts, the total enthalpy change is:  
\[
\Delta H = 0.2 \, \text{moles} \times (-57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.46 \, \text{kJ}.
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
- **Option A (-2.72 kcal):**  
  \( 1 \, \text{kcal} = 4.184 \, \text{kJ} \), so \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} = -2.72 \times 4.184 \approx -11.46 \, \text{kJ} \).  
  This matches the calculated value.

- **Option B (-11.42 kcal):**  
  \( -11.42 \, \text{kcal} = -11.42 \times 4.184 \approx -47.7 \, \text{kJ} \), which is much larger than the calculated value.

- **Option C (-3.80 kcal):**  
  \( -3.80 \, \text{kcal} = -3.80 \times 4.184 \approx -15.9 \, \text{kJ} \), which does not match.

- **Option D (-16.0 kJ):**  
  This is larger than the calculated value of \( -11.46 \, \text{kJ} \).

### Final Answer:
The correct option is **A (-2.72 kcal)**, as it corresponds to \( -11.46 \, \text{kJ} \) when converted.

Answer: A
