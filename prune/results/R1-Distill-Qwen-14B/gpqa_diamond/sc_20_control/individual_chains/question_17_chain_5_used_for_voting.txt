Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution with the Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let me think through what I know.

Alright, the problem says that the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So, the complex is CaEDTA²⁻, I think. And the temperature is 25°C, which is room temperature. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 5x10^10. I remember that K here is the formation constant, which tells us how stable the complex is.

Wait, the formation constant (Kf) is usually defined as [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA⁴-]). So, Kf is 5e10 in this case. But wait, the solution is of the Ca-EDTA complex, which I think is the complex itself. So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M.

But in solution, the complex might dissociate a bit. So, the actual concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA⁴- would be low because the complex is stable. So, the idea is to find the concentration of Ca²+ ions in this solution.

Let me set this up. Let's denote the concentration of the complex as [CaEDTA²-] = 0.02 M. But that's an initial condition. Then, some of it dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA⁴-.

Wait, but wait a second. The formation constant equation is Kf = [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA⁴-]). So, if the complex is dissociating, the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA would increase a bit. But since Kf is so large (5e10), the dissociation would be minimal. That means the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA would be very low compared to the complex.

So, maybe we can approximate that the majority of the complex doesn't dissociate, and [CaEDTA²-] is approximately 0.02 M. But let's model it properly.

Let's let x be the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates. Then, the concentrations would be: [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA⁴-] = x, and [CaEDTA²-] ≈ 0.02 - x. But since Kf is so large, x would be very small compared to 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. So, Kf = 0.02/(x^2) =5e10.

So, solving for x: x^2 = 0.02 / (5e10) → x = sqrt(0.02 /5e10)

Let me compute that. 0.02 is 2e-2. So, 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13. The square root of that is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5, wait, sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * 1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2? No, wait: 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2? Let me compute it properly.

Wait, 1e-6 squared is 1e-12. So, 1e-6.5 squared is 1e-13. So, sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5. Wait, 6.5 is 13/2, so e-6.5 is the same as 3.16e-7. Wait, because e-6 is 1e-6, e-7 is 1e-7. 6.5 is halfway, so 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is approximately 6.32e-7.

Wait, let me calculate it numerically. 0.02 divided by 5e10 is 4e-13. So the square root of 4e-13 is 2e-6.5. 1e-6 is 1e-6, 1e-7 is 0.1e-6. 6.5 is 6 + 0.5. So 1e-6.5 is sqrt(1e-13) = 1e-6.5. So 2e-6.5 is 2 * 3.16e-7 = approx 6.32e-7.

Wait, 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7, so 2 times that is about 6.32e-7. So x ≈ 6.32e-7 M.

So the concentration of Ca²+ is approximately 6.3e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I set up the equation correctly?

Yes, Kf = [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA⁴-]). Since the complex dissociates into one Ca²+ and one EDTA⁴-, their concentrations are the same, so [Ca²+] = [EDTA⁴-] = x. Then, Kf = 0.02/(x²) → x = sqrt(0.02/(5e10)).

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13. Square root is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = 6.32e-7. So yes, that's correct.

So the answer should be option C: 6.3e-7 M.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex (CaEDTA²⁻), we use the formation constant \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \), which is defined as:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Since the complex dissociates minimally due to the large \( K_f \), we approximate that the concentration of the complex remains approximately 0.02 M. Let \( x \) represent the concentration of dissociated \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) and \( \text{EDTA}^{4-} \). The equation becomes:

\[
K_f = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( x \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_f} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}}
\]

\[
x^2 = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.32 \times 10^{-7}
\]

Thus, the concentration of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \). Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:

**C) \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \)**.

So, solving for x: x^2 = 0.02 / (5e10) → x = sqrt(0.02 /5e10)

Let me compute that. 0.02 is 2e-2. So, 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13. The square root of that is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5, wait, sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * 1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2? No, wait: 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2? Let me compute it properly.

Wait, 1e-6 squared is 1e-12. So, 1e-6.5 squared is 1e-13. So, sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5. Wait, 6.5 is 13/2, so e-6.5 is the same as 3.16e-7. Wait, because e-6 is 1e-6, e-7 is 1e-7. 6.5 is halfway, so 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is approximately 6.32e-7.

Wait, let me calculate it numerically. 0.02 divided by 5e10 is 4e-13. So the square root of 4e-13 is 2e-6.5. 1e-6 is 1e-6, 1e-7 is 0.1e-6. 6.5 is 6 + 0.5. So 1e-6.5 is sqrt(1e-13) = 1e-6.5. So 2e-6.5 is 2 * 3.16e-7 = approx 6.32e-7.

Wait, 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7, so 2 times that is about 6.32e-7. So x ≈ 6.32e-7 M.

So the concentration of Ca²+ is approximately 6.3e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I set up the equation correctly?

Yes, Kf = [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA⁴-]). Since the complex dissociates into one Ca²+ and one EDTA⁴-, their concentrations are the same, so [Ca²+] = [EDTA⁴-] = x. Then, Kf = 0.02/(x²) → x = sqrt(0.02/(5e10)).

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13. Square root is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = 6.32e-7. So yes, that's correct.

So the answer should be option C: 6.3e-7 M.
