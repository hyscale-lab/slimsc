Okay, so I've got this chemistry question in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. Hmm, it's about isomers and some specific compounds. The question is divided into two parts: part A and part B.

The first part, A, is asking which compound does not show tautomerism between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Then part B is about determining which of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism.

I remember that tautomerism happens when a compound can shift between different isomeric forms by the movement of a hydrogen and the rearrangement of double bonds. So, for example, in keto-enol tautomerism, a ketone can tautomerize to an enol form.

Starting with part A: Benzoquinone. I think benzoquinone is a cyclic structure with two ketone groups. Wait, benzoquinone is C6H4O2, right? It has two ketone groups opposite each other on the benzene ring. So, it's like o-benzoquinone, but actually, I think it's either para or ortho. Wait, no, benzoquinone is either para (1,4) or ortho (1,2), but which one is which. Or wait, wait, benzoquinone is C6H4O2 with two ketone groups. So, like 1,4-diketone.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. So, it's like 1,3,5-cyclohexanetricarboxylic acid anhydride maybe? Wait, no, no. Wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a cyclic ketone with three ketone groups, each on alternate carbons. So, it's a six-membered ring with ketones at positions 1,3,5.

So, for tautomerism: which of these can tautomerize? Benzoquinone has two ketone groups. Can it undergo keto-enol tautomerism?

Wait, tautomerism requires adjacent hydrogen and double bonds. For keto-enol, you need a hydrogen alpha to the carbonyl and conjugated double bonds. In benzoquinone, the structure is like a benzene ring with two ketones. Let me think: for example, para-benzoquinone is O=C6H4=O, where the two O are at positions 1 and 4.

In that structure, can each ketone tautomerize? Well, each carbonyl group is part of an aromatic system. For keto-enol to occur, you need an alpha hydrogen. So in a benzene ring with two ketones, the adjacent carbons would be CH groups? Wait, no. Wait, in the ring, each carbon is bonded to two other carbons and one O.

Wait, benzoquinone's structure: O=C6H4=O. Wait, no, the structure is O=C6H4=O. So, each of the two ketone groups is on adjacent carbons, but wait, no. Wait, if it's 1,4-benzoquinone, the carbonyl groups are at positions 1 and 4. So the structure is:

O=C6H4=O, with the double bonds between carbons 1-2 and 4-5, but wait, perhaps the ring is fully conjugated as a quinone.

Wait, quinones are cyclic di-ketones. They are aromatic, so they have conjugated pi bonds. So, for example, para-benzoquinone has the structure where the two ketone groups are opposite each other on the benzene ring, with the ring having conjugated double bonds.

In such a structure, each ketone is part of the conjugated system. So, each ketone has adjacent carbons that are double-bonded. So, for each ketone, the adjacent carbon is part of a double bond. So, the alpha position (the carbon next to the carbonyl) is probably a double bond, so there's no hydrogen there. Therefore, there's no alpha hydrogen available for keto-enol tautomerism.

So, benzoquinone can't tautomerize because there are no alpha hydrogens. Because the carbonyl groups are in a conjugated system, and the next carbons are double-bonded, so no H's attached. So, no tautomerism.

Now, what about cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione? That's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. So the structure would be a chair or boat, but more likely a boat if it's 1,3,5-trione. Wait, in any case, the structure would have each ketone group. Now, each ketone has adjacent carbons that are CH2 groups, I think. Because between each ketone is a single bond, so the ring would have CH2 groups.

So, each ketone (O=C-) is connected to a CH2 group. So, the carbonyl is at 1, then the next carbon is CH2, then 3 is another O=C, then CH2, then 5 is O=C, and then back to CH2. Wait, wait, no, because it's a six-membered ring. So, positions 1,3,5 are the ketones. So, each is separated by a single bond. So, each ketone would be at every other carbon.

Wait, but in that structure, each ketone's adjacent carbons would be single bonds. So, each ketone (like at position 1) has on either side a CH2 group—positions 6 and 2, perhaps. So, each of those CH2 groups would have hydrogens, making them alpha hydrogens.

So, those positions (like C2 and C6) are adjacent to the carbonyl group. So, each has two hydrogens. So, in such a case, the molecule can undergo keto-enol tautomerism because the alpha hydrogens are present.

Wait, but wait. The molecule is a tricyclic structure. So, each of those positions would have hydrogens, allowing for keto-enol tautomerism. So, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can tautomerize, I think.

So, part A is which compound does not show tautomerism. So, if benzoquinone doesn't tautomerize and the trione does, then the compound that does not show tautomerism is benzoquinone. So, A = benzoquinone.

Now, moving to part B: between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism (i.e., has stereoisomers).

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure is: OMe-O-C-O-C-O-CH2-C(OH)-CH3? Wait, no. Let me think. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH3-C(OH)-COO- methyl. So, the structure is OMe attached to a COO- group, connected to a CH(OH)CH3 group.

Wait, so the structure is: 

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH(OH)CH3

Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester where the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So, the formula is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the structure is:

CH3
|
C(OH)
|
COOCH3

So, that's the structure. Now, does this molecule have any stereogenic centers (chiral centers)?

Looking at the molecule, the central carbon (the C(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3 (from the hydroxypropanoate),
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and the adjacent carbon. Wait, wait, the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon is the one with the OH, the CH3, the COOCH3, and the other adjacent carbon is connected to the COOCH3. Wait, no, perhaps I should draw the structure.

Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3? No, wait. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Wait, wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon. So, the structure is CH2(COOH)CH(OH)CH3? Wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but the correct structure is CH3CH2COOH. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOCH2COOH.

Wait, no. Wait, the formula for propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So, the second carbon is the middle CH2. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Wait, but that's more like a diol structure. Wait, no, no. Wait, wait, another approach: the propanoate is a three-carbon chain. The 2-hydroxy means the OH is on the second carbon.

So, the structure is:

O
|| 
COOCH3
|
C-OH
|
CH3

Wait, that's not right. Oh, wait, no. It's 2-hydroxypropanoate, so the structure is:

CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (the second carbon) is connected to:

- CH3 group,
- OH group,
- COOCH3 group,
- and the rest? Wait, the central carbon is connected to four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the next carbon (but wait, in this case, the central carbon is the second carbon, so the first is CH3, second is C(OH), third is COOCH3. So, the second carbon is connected to:

- CH3 (carbon 1),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (carbon 3),
- and the adjacent carbon is carbon 3, which is the COOCH3 group.

Wait, no, that can't be right because carbon 3 is a carbonyl carbon. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting tangled up. Let me think again.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the structure: the ester is from 2-hydroxypropanoic acid and methanol. So, the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon is the one with the OH. So, what's attached to that carbon?

The central carbon (position 2) is connected to:

- CH3 (from position 1),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (from position 3),
- and another CH group? Wait, no, because position 3 is the carbonyl.

Wait, position 2 is CH(OH), connected to position 1 (CH3) and position 3 (COOCH3). So, the groups on position 2 are: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the position 3 (which is a carbonyl group). Hmm, but wait, that's only three groups—no, perhaps not.

Wait, maybe the structure is more like:

      O
      |
CH3-C-OH
      |
      COOCH3

Wait, perhaps the central carbon is connected to three groups: CH3, OH, and COOCH3. But that would be three groups, but a carbon must have four bonds. So, perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The molecule is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (the one with OH) is attached to:

- CH3 (from the left),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (from the right),
- and another carbon (the one in the middle, which is the same as the central one, perhaps? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, let's consider the structure: CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3 (left),
- OH (on the same carbon),
- COOCH3 (right),
- and the adjacent carbon on the right is the carbonyl carbon.

Wait, but the central carbon has four bonds: so, to CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the next carbon. So, the next carbon is a carbonyl, which is double-bonded to O, so it's a carbonyl group. So, the central carbon is connected to:

- CH3 (left),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (right),
- and the carbonyl carbon (which is part of the COOCH3 group).

Wait, but the COOCH3 is at the end, so the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon is the one with OH, and it's connected to:

1. CH3 group (from the left),
2. OH group,
3. COOCH3 group,
4. and a single bond to the next carbon, which is the carbonyl carbon (so, the central carbon is connected to the carbonyl via a single bond).

Wait, but in that case, the central carbon is bonded to four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the next carbon (the carbonyl). So, that makes the central carbon a chiral center. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and can exhibit optical isomerism (i.e., it has enantiomers).

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another way: if the central carbon is connected to CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another CH2 group, but I think in this case, the central carbon is connected to the carbonyl group, which is a double bond. So, wait, the adjacent carbon is the carbonyl, which is double-bonded to O, so the central carbon is connected to that via a single bond.

So, the four substituents are:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and the adjacent carbon (which is the carbonyl carbon). But a carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O, so it's not a substituent with another group. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the central carbon is CH(OH), connected to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and the next carbon (which is a carbonyl, but that's a different group).

Wait, the carbonyl group is O=C-OCH3, but the central carbon is connected to the carbonyl carbon. So, the substituents on the central carbon are: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the carbonyl group.

Wait, but the carbonyl group is a carbon double-bonded to O. So, the central carbon is attached to that group, which is different from the others. So, yes, four different groups. Therefore, it's a chiral center, leading to optical isomerism.

Now, dimethyl fumarate. Fumaric acid is an unsaturated dicarboxylic acid. Its structure is HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H. When it forms dimethyl fumarate, it becomes (MeO)OC-CH=CH-CO-O(Me). So, the structure is:

O
||
OCH3-C-CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3?

Wait, no, fumarate is the diester. So, the structure is:

CH2=CH-CO-OCH3
|
CO-OCH3

Wait, actually, fumarate is HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H, so dimethyl fumarate would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 and the other end is CO-OCH3 attached to the same structure. Wait, no, the structure is:

O
||     O
OCH3-C-CH=CH-C-OCH3
||

Wait, no. Fumarate is an unsaturated diacid. So, its structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. The dimethyl ester would be MeOOC-CH=CH-COO-Me. So, it's:

O
||
OCH3-CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3?

Wait, no, that's not right. Fumarate is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, so dimethyl ester is CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3?

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
OCH3-C-CH=CH-C-OCH3
||
O

Wait, no, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. Fumaric acid has the structure HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H. So, the ester would replace the -OH groups with OCH3.

So, dimethyl fumarate is (CH3O)OC-CH=CH-CO-OCH3. So, the structure is two ester groups (COOCH3) on either end of a CH=CH group.

So, the molecule is:

O
||
OCH3-C-CH=CH-C-OCH3
||
O

Wait, but that's not correct. Actually, the structure is more like:

O
||
OCH3   CH2-CH2    OCH3
|       |           |
COOCH3 CH=CH COOCH3

Wait, no, perhaps the correct structure is:

O
||
OCH3-C-CH=CH-C-OCH3
||
O

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the structure as:

CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 and CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 connected somehow? No, that's not right.

Wait, fumarate is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, the ester would be CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-CO-OCH3? No, I think it's MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3.

So, the structure is:

O
||
OCH3 - C - CH=CH - C - OCH3
           ||
           O

Wait, no, that's not right. It's actually:

O
||
OCH3-C-CH=CH-C-OCH3
||
O

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the double bond is in the middle. Oh, right, fumarate has a double bond between the two central carbons. So, the structure is:

MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, no. Fumarate is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, so the dimethyl ester is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3.

So, the structure is:

O
||
OCH3
|
C
|
CH=CH
|
C
|
O
||
OCH3

So, the molecule is:

O
||
OCH3-C-CH=CH-C-OCH3
||
O

Wait, but each of the two carbons attached to the ester groups is connected via a double bond.

So, the central part is CH=CH, with each CH connected to a COOCH3 group.

So, the structure would be:

O
||
OCH3-C-CH=CH-C-OCH3
||
O

But in reality, the structure is (Z)- or (E)-dimethyl fumarate, but wait, wait. Fumaric acid is the trans isomer, while maleic acid is cis. Wait, no: wait, maleic acid is cis, and fumaric acid is trans. So, dimethyl fumarate is the trans diester.

So, the molecule has a double bond between the two CH groups, each attached to a COOCH3.

So, the structure is:

COOCH3
|
C=CH
|
COOCH3

Wait, no, the double bond is between the two CH groups, each attached to COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the structure as:

O
||
OCH3-C-CH2-CH2-C-OCH3
           ||
           O

No, that's not right. No, the double bond is between the two CH groups, making the structure:

O
||
OCH3-C-CH=CH-C-OCH3
||
O

Wait, but that's perhaps not correct. Let me get this straight.

Wait, the correct structure is:

The dimethyl ester of fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. So, the structure is:

O
||
OCH3-C=CH-C-OCH3
||
O

Wait, no, the double bond is between two CH groups, each attached to a COOCH3.

So, the structure is:

O
||
OCH3-C=CH-C-OCH3
||
O

Wait, perhaps it's:

O
||
OCH3-C-CH=CH-C-OCH3
||
O

Wait, no, I'm getting stuck. Another approach: the molecule has two ester groups (COOCH3) attached to a central double bond.

So, the structure is:

COOCH3
|
C=C
|
COOCH3

Wait, but that's not possible because the C=C can't have two COOCH3 groups on each end. So, each end is a CH group attached to COOCH3.

So, it's:

O
||
OCH3-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, no, that's not. Wait, no, fumarate is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, so dimethyl fumarate is CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3). So, the structure is:

O
||
OCH3-C-CH=CH-C-OCH3
||
O

Wait, but that's not correct because the double bond is between the two CH groups, each attached to a COOCH3.

So, the correct structure is:

COOCH3
|
C=CH
|
COOCH3

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps each of the two CH groups is connected to a COOCH3. So, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3). But that would require each CH to have two substituents, which is possible.

So, the structure is:

O
||
OCH3-C-CH2-CH2-C-OCH3
           ||
           O

Wait, no. I think I'm confusing fumarate with another compound. Another approach: fumarate is a trans-dioic acid, so the dimethyl ester would have the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond.

So, when looking at dimethyl fumarate, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, leading to a trans configuration.

Now, does dimethyl fumarate have any stereoisomers that exhibit optical activity?

Well, dimethyl fumarate has a double bond. For a molecule to have optical isomerism, it must have a chiral center or a plane of symmetry. Wait, but dimethyl fumarate is an diester with a double bond. So, if the double bond is in a position where it can have cis and trans isomers, but in this case, the molecule is already in a trans configuration (since it's fumarate, the trans isomer). But wait, does it have any stereogenic centers?

Alternatively, the molecule could have geometric isomerism, but the question is about optical isomerism. Optical isomerism arises from chiral centers, not from geometric isomerism.

So, does dimethyl fumarate have any chiral centers?

Looking at its structure: each ester group is attached to a CH group, which is part of a double bond. So, each of those CH groups is attached to:

- COOCH3,
- two CH2 groups (from the double bond),
- and the double bond.

Wait, no, the structure is:

(CH3O)OC-CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3?

No, no. Let me get the structure correct. Fumarate is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, the dimethyl ester is (CH3O)OC-CH=CH-CO-OCH3.

So, each of the two CH groups in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 group. So, each CH is connected to:

- COOCH3,
- the double bond (so to two other CH groups),
- and two H's.

Wait, no, each CH is part of a double bond, so each has two substituents: one COOCH3 and one CH (the other end of the double bond).

Wait, perhaps each CH is bonded to a COOCH3, a CH (from the double bond), and two H's.

So, each CH group has the structure CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3).

Wait, no, perhaps the structure is:

The double bond is between two CH groups, each attached to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think of the structure as:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
COOCH3

But that's not correct because that would be a single bond. No, it's a double bond in the center. So, the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2
|
CH2
|
COOCH3

Wait, no, no. Another approach: the molecule is CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3). So, each CH in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 and a CH.

Wait, but each CH would have three substituents: COOCH3, CH, and two H's.

So, each CH is CH2(COOCH3)-. Wait, perhaps each CH is bonded to a COOCH3, a CH (from the double bond), and two H's.

In that case, each CH group is attached to:

- COOCH3,
- two H's,
- and the other CH (from the double bond).

So, each CH has two H's, a COOCH3, and the double bond. So, each CH is CH2 (but that's only possible if it's a double bond, which would require that each CH has only one H). Wait, no, maybe it's CH with two substituents: COOCH3 and the double bond. So, each CH in the double bond has:

- COOCH3,
- two bonds (one to each end of the double bond),
- and two H's.

Wait, perhaps each CH is bonded to one COOCH3, two H's, and the other CH via a double bond. So, each CH is CH2(COOCH3) with a double bond to another CH2(COOCH3). No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I should just look at whether dimethyl fumarate has any chiral centers. In its structure, the two ester groups are on either end of a double bond, but each CH in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 and a CH from the other end.

So, each CH in the double bond is attached to:

- COOCH3,
- two H's,
- and the other CH.

So, each CH is CH2(COOCH3), but with a double bond to another CH2(COOCH3). Hmm, but that would make each CH group a CH2 with a double bond. So, in that case, each CH has two H's, a COOCH3, and a double bond to another CH2(COOCH3). So, each of these CH groups is a CH2 group, which is not a chiral center because it's attached to two H's. So, no chiral centers.

Wait, but wait. If the molecule is (E)-dimethyl fumarate, which is (trans), then the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. But in terms of the structure, does that create any chiral centers?

No, because each CH in the double bond has two H's, so they can't be chiral centers. So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, thus it won't exhibit optical isomerism.

But wait, wait another thought. What about the possibility of geometric isomerism? But geometric isomerism (cis-trans) is different from optical isomerism. The question is about optical isomerism, which requires chiral centers.

So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and can exhibit optical isomerism. Dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, so it can't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but earlier I thought that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center. So, in part B, which of the two options shows optical isomerism? The options are methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.

So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center (the central carbon with four different substituents) and thus exhibits optical isomerism. Dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, so it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, part B's correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibits optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me double-check dimethyl fumarate's structure. Because sometimes, if a molecule has a plane of symmetry, it might not have chiral centers. Let's see: dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. Its structure would have the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond. So, the molecule would be:

O
||
OCH3-C=CH-C-OCH3
||
O

But wait, each CH in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 and a CH. So, each CH has:

- COOCH3,
- two H's,
- and the other CH.

Wait, but in that case, each CH is a CH2 group, so no chiral centers. Because a CH2 group can't be a chiral center. So, dimethyl fumarate has no chiral centers and thus no optical isomerism.

So, putting it all together: part A, the compound that does not show tautomerism is benzoquinone. Part B, the compound that shows optical isomerism is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Looking at the options:

Option B says A = benzoquinone and B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Option D says A = benzoquinone and B = dimethyl fumarate.

Wait, but we thought B's answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, so option B would have the correct A and B.

Wait, but let me check the options again:

Option A: A = cyclohexane..., B = methyl.

No, because part A is about the compound that does not show tautomerism, which is benzoquinone, so cyclohexane trione does show, so option A's A is wrong.

Option B: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl. So, that's correct.

Option C: A = cyclohexane, B = dimethyl fumarate. So, both are wrong for part B.

Option D: A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl. But dimethyl doesn't have optical isomerism, so B would be wrong.

So, the correct option is option B: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the correct answers to the question, we analyze the compounds and their properties based on the given information:

### Part A: Compound that does not show tautomerism
1. **Benzoquinone**: This is a cyclic di-ketone with two carbonyl groups on a benzene ring. Tautomerism requires the presence of alpha hydrogens (hydrogens adjacent to a carbonyl group). In benzoquinone, the carbonyl carbons are part of the aromatic system, and the adjacent carbons are double-bonded to other carbons in the ring. This means there are no alpha hydrogens available for tautomerism. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.

2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. Each ketone group is adjacent to CH₂ groups, which have alpha hydrogens. The presence of alpha hydrogens allows for keto-enol tautomerism. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**.

From this analysis, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.

---

### Part B: Compound that shows optical isomerism
1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure of this compound is CH₃-C(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon (C(OH)) is bonded to four different groups: CH₃, OH, COOCH₃, and the adjacent carbon. This makes it a chiral center, allowing the compound to exhibit optical isomerism (enantiomerism).

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure of dimethyl fumarate is (CH₃O)OC-CH=CH-CO-OCH₃. The double bond between the two CH groups means there are no chiral centers in the molecule. While the compound can exhibit geometric isomerism (cis/trans), it does not have any chiral centers and therefore does not show optical isomerism.

From this analysis, the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

---

### Final Answer
Combining the results from Part A and Part B:
- **A = benzoquinone**
- **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**

The correct option is **B**.

ANSWER: B

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry question in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. Hmm, it's about isomers and some specific compounds. The question is divided into two parts: part A and part B.

The first part, A, is asking which compound does not show tautomerism between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Then part B is about determining which of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism.

I remember that tautomerism happens when a compound can shift between different isomeric forms by the movement of a hydrogen and the rearrangement of double bonds. So, for example, in keto-enol tautomerism, a ketone can tautomerize to an enol form.

Starting with part A: Benzoquinone. I think benzoquinone is a cyclic structure with two ketone groups. Wait, benzoquinone is C6H4O2, right? It has two ketone groups opposite each other on the benzene ring. So, it's like o-benzoquinone, but actually, I think it's either para or ortho. Wait, no, benzoquinone is either para (1,4) or ortho (1,2), but which one is which. Or wait, wait, benzoquinone is C6H4O2 with two ketone groups. So, like 1,4-diketone.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. So, it's like 1,3,5-cyclohexanetricarboxylic acid anhydride maybe? Wait, no, no. Wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a cyclic ketone with three ketone groups, each on alternate carbons. So, it's a six-membered ring with ketones at positions 1,3,5.

So, for tautomerism: which of these can tautomerize? Benzoquinone has two ketone groups. Can it undergo keto-enol tautomerism?

Wait, tautomerism requires adjacent hydrogen and double bonds. For keto-enol, you need a hydrogen alpha to the carbonyl and conjugated double bonds. In benzoquinone, the structure is like a benzene ring with two ketones. Let me think: for example, para-benzoquinone is O=C6H4=O, where the two O are at positions 1 and 4.

In that structure, can each ketone tautomerize? Well, each carbonyl group is part of an aromatic system. For keto-enol to occur, you need an alpha hydrogen. So in a benzene ring with two ketones, the adjacent carbons would be CH groups? Wait, no. Wait, in the ring, each carbon is bonded to two other carbons and one O.

Wait, benzoquinone's structure: O=C6H4=O. Wait, no, the structure is O=C6H4=O. So, each of the two ketone groups is on adjacent carbons, but wait, no. Wait, if it's 1,4-benzoquinone, the carbonyl groups are at positions 1 and 4. So the structure is:

O=C6H4=O, with the double bonds between carbons 1-2 and 4-5, but wait, perhaps the ring is fully conjugated as a quinone.

Wait, quinones are cyclic di-ketones. They are aromatic, so they have conjugated pi bonds. So, for example, para-benzoquinone has the structure where the two ketone groups are opposite each other on the benzene ring, with the ring having conjugated double bonds.

In such a structure, each ketone is part of the conjugated system. So, each ketone has adjacent carbons that are double-bonded. So, for each ketone, the adjacent carbon is part of a double bond. So, the alpha position (the carbon next to the carbonyl) is probably a double bond, so there's no hydrogen there. Therefore, there's no alpha hydrogen available for keto-enol tautomerism.

So, benzoquinone can't tautomerize because there are no alpha hydrogens. Because the carbonyl groups are in a conjugated system, and the next carbons are double-bonded, so no H's attached. So, no tautomerism.

Now, what about cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione? That's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. So the structure would be a chair or boat, but more likely a boat if it's 1,3,5-trione. Wait, in any case, the structure would have each ketone group. Now, each ketone has adjacent carbons that are CH2 groups, I think. Because between each ketone is a single bond, so the ring would have CH2 groups.

So, each ketone (O=C-) is connected to a CH2 group. So, the carbonyl is at 1, then the next carbon is CH2, then 3 is another O=C, then CH2, then 5 is O=C, and then back to CH2. Wait, wait, no, because it's a six-membered ring. So, positions 1,3,5 are the ketones. So, each is separated by a single bond. So, each ketone would be at every other carbon.

Wait, but in that structure, each ketone's adjacent carbons would be single bonds. So, each ketone (like at position 1) has on either side a CH2 group—positions 6 and 2, perhaps. So, each of those CH2 groups would have hydrogens, making them alpha hydrogens.

So, those positions (like C2 and C6) are adjacent to the carbonyl group. So, each has two hydrogens. So, in such a case, the molecule can undergo keto-enol tautomerism because the alpha hydrogens are present.

Wait, but wait. The molecule is a tricyclic structure. So, each of those positions would have hydrogens, allowing for keto-enol tautomerism. So, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can tautomerize, I think.

So, part A is which compound does not show tautomerism. So, if benzoquinone doesn't tautomerize and the trione does, then the compound that does not show tautomerism is benzoquinone. So, A = benzoquinone.

Now, moving to part B: between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism (i.e., has stereoisomers).

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure is: OMe-O-C-O-C-O-CH2-C(OH)-CH3? Wait, no. Let me think. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH3-C(OH)-COO- methyl. So, the structure is OMe attached to a COO- group, connected to a CH(OH)CH3 group.

Wait, so the structure is: 

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH(OH)CH3

Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester where the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So, the formula is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the structure is:

CH3
|
C(OH)
|
COOCH3

So, that's the structure. Now, does this molecule have any stereogenic centers (chiral centers)?

Looking at the molecule, the central carbon (the C(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3 (from the hydroxypropanoate),
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and the adjacent carbon. Wait, wait, the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon is the one with the OH, the CH3, the COOCH3, and the other adjacent carbon is connected to the COOCH3. Wait, no, perhaps I should draw the structure.

Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3? No, wait. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Wait, wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon. So, the structure is CH2(COOH)CH(OH)CH3? Wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but the correct structure is CH3CH2COOH. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOCH2COOH.

Wait, no. Wait, the formula for propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So, the second carbon is the middle CH2. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Wait, but that's more like a diol structure. Wait, no, no. Wait, wait, another approach: the propanoate is a three-carbon chain. The 2-hydroxy means the OH is on the second carbon.

So, the structure is:

O
|| 
COOCH3
|
C-OH
|
CH3

Wait, that's not right. Oh, wait, no. It's 2-hydroxypropanoate, so the structure is:

CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (the second carbon) is connected to:

- CH3 group,
- OH group,
- COOCH3 group,
- and the rest? Wait, the central carbon is connected to four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the next carbon (but wait, in this case, the central carbon is the second carbon, so the first is CH3, second is C(OH), third is COOCH3. So, the second carbon is connected to:

- CH3 (carbon 1),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (carbon 3),
- and the adjacent carbon is carbon 3, which is the COOCH3 group.

Wait, no, that can't be right because carbon 3 is a carbonyl carbon. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting tangled up. Let me think again.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the structure: the ester is from 2-hydroxypropanoic acid and methanol. So, the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon is the one with the OH. So, what's attached to that carbon?

The central carbon (position 2) is connected to:

- CH3 (from position 1),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (from position 3),
- and another CH group? Wait, no, because position 3 is the carbonyl.

Wait, position 2 is CH(OH), connected to position 1 (CH3) and position 3 (COOCH3). So, the groups on position 2 are: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the position 3 (which is a carbonyl group). Hmm, but wait, that's only three groups—no, perhaps not.

Wait, maybe the structure is more like:

      O
      |
CH3-C-OH
      |
      COOCH3

Wait, perhaps the central carbon is connected to three groups: CH3, OH, and COOCH3. But that would be three groups, but a carbon must have four bonds. So, perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The molecule is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (the one with OH) is attached to:

- CH3 (from the left),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (from the right),
- and another carbon (the one in the middle, which is the same as the central one, perhaps? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, let's consider the structure: CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3 (left),
- OH (on the same carbon),
- COOCH3 (right),
- and the adjacent carbon on the right is the carbonyl carbon.

Wait, but the central carbon has four bonds: so, to CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the next carbon. So, the next carbon is a carbonyl, which is double-bonded to O, so it's a carbonyl group. So, the central carbon is connected to:

- CH3 (left),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (right),
- and the carbonyl carbon (which is part of the COOCH3 group).

Wait, but the COOCH3 is at the end, so the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon is the one with OH, and it's connected to:

1. CH3 group (from the left),
2. OH group,
3. COOCH3 group,
4. and a single bond to the next carbon, which is the carbonyl carbon (so, the central carbon is connected to the carbonyl via a single bond).

Wait, but in that case, the central carbon is bonded to four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the next carbon (the carbonyl). So, that makes the central carbon a chiral center. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and can exhibit optical isomerism (i.e., it has enantiomers).

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another way: if the central carbon is connected to CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another CH2 group, but I think in this case, the central carbon is connected to the carbonyl group, which is a double bond. So, wait, the adjacent carbon is the carbonyl, which is double-bonded to O, so the central carbon is connected to that via a single bond.

So, the four substituents are:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and the adjacent carbon (which is the carbonyl carbon). But a carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O, so it's not a substituent with another group. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the central carbon is CH(OH), connected to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and the next carbon (which is a carbonyl, but that's a different group).

Wait, the carbonyl group is O=C-OCH3, but the central carbon is connected to the carbonyl carbon. So, the substituents on the central carbon are: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the carbonyl group.

Wait, but the carbonyl group is a carbon double-bonded to O. So, the central carbon is attached to that group, which is different from the others. So, yes, four different groups. Therefore, it's a chiral center, leading to optical isomerism.

Now, dimethyl fumarate. Fumaric acid is an unsaturated dicarboxylic acid. Its structure is HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H. When it forms dimethyl fumarate, it becomes (MeO)OC-CH=CH-CO-O(Me). So, the structure is:

O
||
OCH3-C-CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3?

Wait, no, fumarate is the diester. So, the structure is:

CH2=CH-CO-OCH3
|
CO-OCH3

Wait, actually, fumarate is HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H, so dimethyl fumarate would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 and the other end is CO-OCH3 attached to the same structure. Wait, no, the structure is:

O
||     O
OCH3-C-CH=CH-C-OCH3
||

Wait, no. Fumarate is an unsaturated diacid. So, its structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. The dimethyl ester would be MeOOC-CH=CH-COO-Me. So, it's:

O
||
OCH3-CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3?

Wait, no, that's not right. Fumarate is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, so dimethyl ester is CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3?

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
OCH3-C-CH=CH-C-OCH3
||
O

Wait, no, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. Fumaric acid has the structure HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H. So, the ester would replace the -OH groups with OCH3.

So, dimethyl fumarate is (CH3O)OC-CH=CH-CO-OCH3. So, the structure is two ester groups (COOCH3) on either end of a CH=CH group.

So, the molecule is:

O
||
OCH3-C-CH=CH-C-OCH3
||
O

Wait, but that's not correct. Actually, the structure is more like:

O
||
OCH3   CH2-CH2    OCH3
|       |           |
COOCH3 CH=CH COOCH3

Wait, no, perhaps the correct structure is:

O
||
OCH3-C-CH=CH-C-OCH3
||
O

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the structure as:

CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 and CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 connected somehow? No, that's not right.

Wait, fumarate is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, the ester would be CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-CO-OCH3? No, I think it's MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3.

So, the structure is:

O
||
OCH3 - C - CH=CH - C - OCH3
           ||
           O

Wait, no, that's not right. It's actually:

O
||
OCH3-C-CH=CH-C-OCH3
||
O

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the double bond is in the middle. Oh, right, fumarate has a double bond between the two central carbons. So, the structure is:

MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, no. Fumarate is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, so the dimethyl ester is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3.

So, the structure is:

O
||
OCH3
|
C
|
CH=CH
|
C
|
O
||
OCH3

So, the molecule is:

O
||
OCH3-C-CH=CH-C-OCH3
||
O

Wait, but each of the two carbons attached to the ester groups is connected via a double bond.

So, the central part is CH=CH, with each CH connected to a COOCH3 group.

So, the structure would be:

O
||
OCH3-C-CH=CH-C-OCH3
||
O

But in reality, the structure is (Z)- or (E)-dimethyl fumarate, but wait, wait. Fumaric acid is the trans isomer, while maleic acid is cis. Wait, no: wait, maleic acid is cis, and fumaric acid is trans. So, dimethyl fumarate is the trans diester.

So, the molecule has a double bond between the two CH groups, each attached to a COOCH3.

So, the structure is:

COOCH3
|
C=CH
|
COOCH3

Wait, no, the double bond is between the two CH groups, each attached to COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the structure as:

O
||
OCH3-C-CH2-CH2-C-OCH3
           ||
           O

No, that's not right. No, the double bond is between the two CH groups, making the structure:

O
||
OCH3-C-CH=CH-C-OCH3
||
O

Wait, but that's perhaps not correct. Let me get this straight.

Wait, the correct structure is:

The dimethyl ester of fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. So, the structure is:

O
||
OCH3-C=CH-C-OCH3
||
O

Wait, no, the double bond is between two CH groups, each attached to a COOCH3.

So, the structure is:

O
||
OCH3-C=CH-C-OCH3
||
O

Wait, perhaps it's:

O
||
OCH3-C-CH=CH-C-OCH3
||
O

Wait, no, I'm getting stuck. Another approach: the molecule has two ester groups (COOCH3) attached to a central double bond.

So, the structure is:

COOCH3
|
C=C
|
COOCH3

Wait, but that's not possible because the C=C can't have two COOCH3 groups on each end. So, each end is a CH group attached to COOCH3.

So, it's:

O
||
OCH3-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, no, that's not. Wait, no, fumarate is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, so dimethyl fumarate is CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3). So, the structure is:

O
||
OCH3-C-CH=CH-C-OCH3
||
O

Wait, but that's not correct because the double bond is between the two CH groups, each attached to a COOCH3.

So, the correct structure is:

COOCH3
|
C=CH
|
COOCH3

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps each of the two CH groups is connected to a COOCH3. So, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3). But that would require each CH to have two substituents, which is possible.

So, the structure is:

O
||
OCH3-C-CH2-CH2-C-OCH3
           ||
           O

Wait, no. I think I'm confusing fumarate with another compound. Another approach: fumarate is a trans-dioic acid, so the dimethyl ester would have the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond.

So, when looking at dimethyl fumarate, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, leading to a trans configuration.

Now, does dimethyl fumarate have any stereoisomers that exhibit optical activity?

Well, dimethyl fumarate has a double bond. For a molecule to have optical isomerism, it must have a chiral center or a plane of symmetry. Wait, but dimethyl fumarate is an diester with a double bond. So, if the double bond is in a position where it can have cis and trans isomers, but in this case, the molecule is already in a trans configuration (since it's fumarate, the trans isomer). But wait, does it have any stereogenic centers?

Alternatively, the molecule could have geometric isomerism, but the question is about optical isomerism. Optical isomerism arises from chiral centers, not from geometric isomerism.

So, does dimethyl fumarate have any chiral centers?

Looking at its structure: each ester group is attached to a CH group, which is part of a double bond. So, each of those CH groups is attached to:

- COOCH3,
- two CH2 groups (from the double bond),
- and the double bond.

Wait, no, the structure is:

(CH3O)OC-CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3?

No, no. Let me get the structure correct. Fumarate is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, the dimethyl ester is (CH3O)OC-CH=CH-CO-OCH3.

So, each of the two CH groups in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 group. So, each CH is connected to:

- COOCH3,
- the double bond (so to two other CH groups),
- and two H's.

Wait, no, each CH is part of a double bond, so each has two substituents: one COOCH3 and one CH (the other end of the double bond).

Wait, perhaps each CH is bonded to a COOCH3, a CH (from the double bond), and two H's.

So, each CH group has the structure CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3).

Wait, no, perhaps the structure is:

The double bond is between two CH groups, each attached to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think of the structure as:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
COOCH3

But that's not correct because that would be a single bond. No, it's a double bond in the center. So, the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2
|
CH2
|
COOCH3

Wait, no, no. Another approach: the molecule is CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3). So, each CH in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 and a CH.

Wait, but each CH would have three substituents: COOCH3, CH, and two H's.

So, each CH is CH2(COOCH3)-. Wait, perhaps each CH is bonded to a COOCH3, a CH (from the double bond), and two H's.

In that case, each CH group is attached to:

- COOCH3,
- two H's,
- and the other CH (from the double bond).

So, each CH has two H's, a COOCH3, and the double bond. So, each CH is CH2 (but that's only possible if it's a double bond, which would require that each CH has only one H). Wait, no, maybe it's CH with two substituents: COOCH3 and the double bond. So, each CH in the double bond has:

- COOCH3,
- two bonds (one to each end of the double bond),
- and two H's.

Wait, perhaps each CH is bonded to one COOCH3, two H's, and the other CH via a double bond. So, each CH is CH2(COOCH3) with a double bond to another CH2(COOCH3). No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I should just look at whether dimethyl fumarate has any chiral centers. In its structure, the two ester groups are on either end of a double bond, but each CH in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 and a CH from the other end.

So, each CH in the double bond is attached to:

- COOCH3,
- two H's,
- and the other CH.

So, each CH is CH2(COOCH3), but with a double bond to another CH2(COOCH3). Hmm, but that would make each CH group a CH2 with a double bond. So, in that case, each CH has two H's, a COOCH3, and a double bond to another CH2(COOCH3). So, each of these CH groups is a CH2 group, which is not a chiral center because it's attached to two H's. So, no chiral centers.

Wait, but wait. If the molecule is (E)-dimethyl fumarate, which is (trans), then the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. But in terms of the structure, does that create any chiral centers?

No, because each CH in the double bond has two H's, so they can't be chiral centers. So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, thus it won't exhibit optical isomerism.

But wait, wait another thought. What about the possibility of geometric isomerism? But geometric isomerism (cis-trans) is different from optical isomerism. The question is about optical isomerism, which requires chiral centers.

So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and can exhibit optical isomerism. Dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, so it can't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but earlier I thought that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center. So, in part B, which of the two options shows optical isomerism? The options are methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.

So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center (the central carbon with four different substituents) and thus exhibits optical isomerism. Dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, so it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, part B's correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibits optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me double-check dimethyl fumarate's structure. Because sometimes, if a molecule has a plane of symmetry, it might not have chiral centers. Let's see: dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. Its structure would have the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond. So, the molecule would be:

O
||
OCH3-C=CH-C-OCH3
||
O

But wait, each CH in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 and a CH. So, each CH has:

- COOCH3,
- two H's,
- and the other CH.

Wait, but in that case, each CH is a CH2 group, so no chiral centers. Because a CH2 group can't be a chiral center. So, dimethyl fumarate has no chiral centers and thus no optical isomerism.

So, putting it all together: part A, the compound that does not show tautomerism is benzoquinone. Part B, the compound that shows optical isomerism is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Looking at the options:

Option B says A = benzoquinone and B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Option D says A = benzoquinone and B = dimethyl fumarate.

Wait, but we thought B's answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, so option B would have the correct A and B.

Wait, but let me check the options again:

Option A: A = cyclohexane..., B = methyl.

No, because part A is about the compound that does not show tautomerism, which is benzoquinone, so cyclohexane trione does show, so option A's A is wrong.

Option B: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl. So, that's correct.

Option C: A = cyclohexane, B = dimethyl fumarate. So, both are wrong for part B.

Option D: A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl. But dimethyl doesn't have optical isomerism, so B would be wrong.

So, the correct option is option B: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.


To determine the correct answers to the question, we analyze the compounds and their properties based on the given information:

### Part A: Compound that does not show tautomerism
1. **Benzoquinone**: This is a cyclic di-ketone with two carbonyl groups on a benzene ring. Tautomerism requires the presence of alpha hydrogens (hydrogens adjacent to a carbonyl group). In benzoquinone, the carbonyl carbons are part of the aromatic system, and the adjacent carbons are double-bonded to other carbons in the ring. This means there are no alpha hydrogens available for tautomerism. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.

2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. Each ketone group is adjacent to CH₂ groups, which have alpha hydrogens. The presence of alpha hydrogens allows for keto-enol tautomerism. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**.

From this analysis, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.

---

### Part B: Compound that shows optical isomerism
1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure of this compound is CH₃-C(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon (C(OH)) is bonded to four different groups: CH₃, OH, COOCH₃, and the adjacent carbon. This makes it a chiral center, allowing the compound to exhibit optical isomerism (enantiomerism).

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure of dimethyl fumarate is (CH₃O)OC-CH=CH-CO-OCH₃. The double bond between the two CH groups means there are no chiral centers in the molecule. While the compound can exhibit geometric isomerism (cis/trans), it does not have any chiral centers and therefore does not show optical isomerism.

From this analysis, the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

---

### Final Answer
Combining the results from Part A and Part B:
- **A = benzoquinone**
- **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**

The correct option is **B**.

ANSWER: B
