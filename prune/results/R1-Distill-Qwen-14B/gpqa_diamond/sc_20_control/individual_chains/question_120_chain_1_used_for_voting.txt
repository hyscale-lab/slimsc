Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I need to figure out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. Let me think about what I remember from my astronomy and some math.

Alright, parallax is a measure of distance to a star. I remember that the parallax (p) in parsecs is inversely related to the distance (d) in parsecs, so p = 1/d. Oh right, because the closer the star, the larger the parallax. So if a star is at distance d, its parallax is p = 1/d.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit change in parallax. So, I guess I need to think about the volume of space at a certain distance range and how that relates to parallax.

Wait, stars are uniformly distributed, so the number of stars should depend on the volume of the spherical shell at a particular distance. The volume of a thin spherical shell with radius d and thickness dr is approximately 4πd² dr. Because the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³, but the shell is just the difference between two spheres, which is roughly 4πd² dr for thin shells.

So the number of stars in a volume dV would be proportional to dV, since the distribution is uniform. So N ∝ 4πd² dr.

But since d = 1/p, where p is parallax, I can substitute that in. Let me do that.

d = 1/p → dr = - (1/p²) dp. Wait, since p is decreasing as d increases, when d increases, p decreases. So as d increases by dr, p decreases by dp. So the relation between dr and dp is dr = - (1/p²) dp. Hmm, but when considering a range of p, like from p to p+dp, I think I need to relate dr in terms of dp.

Alternatively, maybe I should express d in terms of p and then express the volume in terms of p. Let's see.

Volume in terms of p: d = 1/p → dr = - (1/p²) dp. So, the volume element dV in terms of p would be 4πd² dr. But d is 1/p, so d² is 1/p². And dr is ( -1/p² dp ), but since we're considering a small positive dp, maybe the negative just indicates the direction of change and we can take the absolute value.

So putting it together, dV = 4π*(1/p²) * (1/p²) dp. Wait, that would make dV = 4π (1/p^4) dp. So the number of stars in a thin shell at parallax p would be proportional to 1/p^4 times dp.

Wait no, because the number of stars in a volume element dV is N = n * dV, where n is the number density (stars per volume). But since the stars are uniformly distributed, n is constant. So N ∝ dV. So N per unit parallax would be (dV)/(dp). Wait, but in the question, it's the number per unit range of parallax. So the question is, how does N change with p? So N is proportional to (dV/dp).

Let me recast that. Since dV = 4π d² dr, and dr = (1/p²) dp (taking positive values), so dV = 4π (1/p²) (1/p²) dp? Wait, no, wait: dV is 4π d² dr. dr is (1/p²) dp. So substituting d=1/p, dV = 4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp? That would be 4π (1/p^4) dp.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Let me think again. dV is the volume element. If the shell is at distance d, thickness dr, then dV = 4π d² dr. Since d = 1/p, then dr = ( -1/p² ) dp. So substituting, dV = 4π (1/p)^2 * ( -1/p² ) dp. But since dp is positive when p is decreasing, the negative might indicate direction. But maybe I should just take absolute values, so dV = 4π (1/p^2) * (1/p^2) dp → 4π (1/p^4) dp.

So the number of stars in this shell would be proportional to 1/p^4 dp. But the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So per unit p, that would be N = (something) * (1/p^4) * dp / dp → 1/p^4. So the number of stars per unit parallax is proportional to 1/p^4.

Wait, but that would suggest option A) ~1/p^4. But I'm a bit confused because I thought the volume element scales with p^-4. Let me think about units. Parallax p is in (length)^-1. So 1/p^4 is (length)^-4. Volume is (length)^3, so 1/p^4 would not make sense unless I'm missing a factor.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in substitution. Let me try another approach. Let's express everything in terms of distance d.

Number of stars in a thin shell between d and d+dr is N = 4π d² n dr, where n is number density (stars per volume).

But how does this translate to parallax? Since p = 1/d, then d = 1/p. So N = 4π (1/p)^2 n dr.

But dr is the change in distance, which is related to the change in parallax. Let's find dr in terms of dp.

p = 1/d → dp = -1/d² dr → dr = - d² dp = - (1/p²) dp.

Since we're considering a small dp, the sign just tells us about the direction, but we can take the absolute value. So dr = (1/p²) dp.

Substituting into N:

N = 4π (1/p^2) n (1/p^2) dp → 4π n (1/p^4) dp.

So N is proportional to (1/p^4) dp. So the number of stars per unit parallax (dp) is proportional to 1/p^4. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (so, per unit p) is proportional to 1/p^4.

Wait, but let me think again. The question says: "number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx?"

Wait, the wording is a bit tricky. It's the number of stars per unit plx range. So for a small change in plx (dp), how many stars are there? That's exactly N, which is proportional to 1/p^4 as we derived.

So looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4.

But wait, I thought that the number density in 3D space would lead to a certain scaling. Another way to think about it: in terms of distance, the volume increases with d^2 (the surface area) times dr. So the number of stars between d and d+dr is proportional to d² dr. So per unit distance, that's proportional to d².

But when you convert to parallax, d=1/p, so d² is (1/p)^2. So per unit dp, which is (1/d^2) dd, the number of stars would be 4pi (d² dr) → but dr is (1/p^2) dp. So substituting, we get 4 pi (1/p^2) * (1/p^2) dp → 4 pi / p^4 dp. So yes, per unit parallax, it's 1/p^4.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option A, ~1/plx^4.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by considering the relationship between parallax and distance. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( p = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( p \) is the parallax and \( d \) is the distance to the star. 

The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dr \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( 4\pi d^2 dr \). Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in this shell is \( N \propto 4\pi d^2 dr \).

To express this in terms of parallax, we substitute \( d = \frac{1}{p} \), so \( d^2 = \frac{1}{p^2} \). Additionally, the thickness \( dr \) can be related to \( dp \) (a small change in parallax) using the derivative \( dr = -\frac{1}{p^2} dp \). Substituting these into the expression for \( N \), we get:

\[
N \propto 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{p^2}\right) \left(-\frac{1}{p^2} dp\right).
\]

Taking the absolute value (since we are interested in the magnitude), this simplifies to:

\[
N \propto \frac{4\pi}{p^4} dp.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (i.e., per unit \( dp \)) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{p^4} \). This means the number of stars decreases as the fourth power of the parallax.

From the given options:
- **A) ~ \( 1/p^4 \):** Matches the derived result.
- **B) ~ \( 1/p^2 \):** Incorrect, as the scaling is steeper than \( 1/p^2 \).
- **C) ~ \( 1/p^1 \):** Incorrect, as the scaling is steeper than \( 1/p \).
- **D) ~ \( 1/p^3 \):** Incorrect, as the scaling is steeper than \( 1/p^3 \).

The correct answer is **A) ~ \( 1/p^4 \)**.
