Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

Alright, the problem is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. They also measured their radial velocities as 0 and 700 km/s respectively. The question is about the luminosity ratio of Star_1 to Star_2, assuming black body radiation. The options are A to D with different factors, so I need to figure out which one is right.

Wait, okay, so luminosity of stars. I remember that luminosity depends on both the radius and the temperature of the star. The formula for luminosity when considering a star as a black body is the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So L is proportional to R² T⁴.

But wait, the problem says that the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ_max is same, T must be same (since λ_max is inversely proportional to T).

Wait, that's a crucial point. So both stars have the same temperature? Because their peak emission wavelengths are the same. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but the problem says the stars have different masses and radii. Hmm, but if T is the same, then the luminosity ratio would just depend on R², because L is proportional to R² T⁴, and T is the same for both.

Wait wait, but the problem states that the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Oh, but in the luminosity calculation, mass doesn't directly come into play here. So unless it's a red herring, but maybe it's just extra info.

Wait, but the radial velocities are given: zero for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. Hmm, radial velocity refers to the velocity along the line of sight, but how does that affect the observed wavelength? Oh, right! The Doppler effect. When a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted, and if moving away, redshifted. But in this case, Star_1 has zero radial velocity, so no shift. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Wait, but how does that affect the peak wavelength?

Wait, I thought the peak wavelength as measured by the astronomers is the same. So if Star_2 is moving, its emitted wavelength is shifted, but the observed peak is the same as Star_1's. Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait, so let me think. Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. So the light it emits is Doppler shifted. But the observed wavelengths (where they appear brightest) are the same as Star_1. So the peak wavelength we observe for Star_2 is the same as Star_1's. So the emitted λ_max is different, but due to Doppler shift, it's observed the same.

Wait, but wait. If Star_2 is moving towards us, its light would be blueshifted, making the observed λ shorter than the emitted. Or if moving away, redshifted. But here, the problem says that the observed λ_max is the same. So the emitted λ_max must be different, but the observed is same because of Doppler.

Wait, but how does that affect the calculation of temperature?

Wait, using Wien's law, T is calculated based on the observed λ_max. So if Star_2 is moving, we observe a λ_max that's Doppler shifted. So the actual emitted λ_max would be different. So when considering their true temperatures, we might have to correct for the Doppler shift.

Hmm, perhaps I should model this.

Let me denote:

For Star_1: observed λ_max1 = λ1. Since radial velocity is zero, the emitted λ_max1 is same as observed λ_max1. So T1 = b / λ1.

For Star_2: observed λ_max2 = λ1 (same as Star_1's observed). But Star_2 is moving with velocity v = 700 km/s. So the Doppler effect will shift the emitted λ_max2 to λ1.

What is the Doppler shift formula for wavelength? I think it's λ_observed = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ), but wait, isn't that for relativistic speeds? 700 km/s is about 0.23% the speed of light (since c is ~3e5 km/s), so maybe non-relativistic approximation is okay.

Alternatively, the approximate Doppler shift formula is λ_observed ≈ λ_emitted * (1 + v/c) when moving away (v positive if moving away), but wait, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, when a source is moving towards the observer, the observed wavelength is shorter (blueshifted). So if Star_2 is moving towards us, its observed λ would be less than the emitted λ. But in this case, Star_2's observed λ is the same as Star_1's, which is λ1.

Wait, but from the problem statement, do we know whether Star_2 is moving towards or away? The radial velocity is given as 700 km/s. Radial velocity can be positive (moving away) or negative (moving towards). But the problem doesn't specify. Hmm. Well, perhaps to find the effect, we can proceed regardless.

Alternatively, perhaps the radial velocity is 700 km/s, but direction is implied? Or maybe it's a redshift, meaning moving away. Wait, but without knowing the direction, it's tricky. But perhaps the question is simplified, considering the Doppler effect's impact on the observed wavelength.

Let me clarify. The star emits light with λ_max2, but due to its motion, we observe λ_max_observed2 = λ1. So we can relate λ_max2 and λ_max_observed2 via the Doppler effect.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck on this. Let me try to write the equations.

Let’s denote:

λ_observed = λ_emitted * sqrt[ (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) ]

Wait, that's the relativistic Doppler shift formula when the source is moving away (v positive). But for small velocities, we can approximate this as λ_observed ≈ λ_emitted * (1 + v/c).

Wait, no. Let me think again. The relativistic Doppler shift is given by:

λ_observed / λ_emitted = sqrt( (1 + β) / (1 - β) ), where β = v/c.

If the star is moving away (v positive), the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted), so λ_observed > λ_emitted.

So if Star_2 is moving away, then λ_observed2 = λ_emitted2 * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

But in our case, λ_observed2 = λ_observed1 = λ1.

So:

λ1 = λ2_observed = λ2_emitted * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

But what's λ2_emitted? It's the peak wavelength emitted by Star_2, which is related to its temperature. From Wien's Law, λ_max = b / T. So λ2_emitted = b / T2.

Similarly, λ1_emitted = b / T1.

But wait, the problem says that the stars were observed to have the same peak wavelength, which I think is λ1 = λ2_observed.

But the actual emitted wavelengths would be λ1_emitted and λ2_emitted. So, the observed wavelength for Star_1 is λ1_emitted, since it's not moving (v=0). The observed wavelength for Star_2 is λ2_emitted multiplied by the Doppler shift factor.

So λ_observed2 = λ2_emitted * Doppler factor.

We know λ_observed2 = λ_observed1 = λ1.

So,

λ1 = λ2_emitted * Doppler shift.

But λ1 = λ1_emitted, because Star_1 isn't moving. So,

λ1_emitted = λ2_emitted * Doppler shift.

So,

λ1_emitted = λ2_emitted * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

So,

λ1_emitted / λ2_emitted = sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

But λ is inversely proportional to T, so:

(T2 / T1) = sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

Because λ1_emitted = b / T1, λ2_emitted = b / T2. So λ1_emitted / λ2_emitted = T2 / T1.

So,

T2 / T1 = sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

So,

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

Wait, but T2 and T1 are the actual temperatures of the stars, but if we're using the observed λ, which is the same, then perhaps T_observed would be same? Or wait, no. Because the observed λ is the same, but the emitted λ depends on the star's actual temperature and Doppler shift.

But I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to approach it another way.

Since the observed λ_max is the same for both stars, and assuming that their temperatures might differ due to Doppler shift, how does that affect their actual temperatures?

Wait, another approach: The observed λ_max for Star_2 is λ_max_observed = λ_max2 * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) ) ), if it's moving away. Because if it's moving away, the observed wavelength is longer than emitted, so the factor is less than one, making λ_observed larger.

Wait, so if Star_2 is moving away (v positive), then the observed wavelength is longer than emitted. So the observed λ_max is the same as Star_1's emitted λ_max.

So,

λ_max_observed2 = λ_max2 * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) ) )

But λ_max_observed2 equals λ_max_observed1, which is λ_max1. And λ_max1 is the emitted wavelength of Star_1, since it's not moving.

So,

λ_max1 = λ_max2 * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

But λ_max1 = b / T1, and λ_max2 = b / T2.

Substituting,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

So,

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

Wait, no, because:

Multiply both sides by T2,

T2/(T1) = sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

So,

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

Hmm, but I don't know the value of β (v/c). The radial velocity is 700 km/s. So let's calculate β.

v = 700 km/s.

c is approximately 3e5 km/s.

So,

β = v/c = 700 / 3e5 = 700 / 300000 ≈ 0.0023333...

So,

(1 + β) ≈ 1.0023333

(1 - β) ≈ 0.9976667

So,

(1 + β)/(1 - β) ≈ (1.0023333)/(0.9976667) ≈ 1.0046666...

Take the square root: sqrt(1.0046666) ≈ 1.00233.

So,

T2 ≈ T1 * 1.00233

So, T2 is about 0.23% higher than T1.

Wait, but that's a small difference. So the temperatures are almost the same, but not exactly. So the luminosity calculation can't be based solely on R².

But wait, the problem says the stars were observed to have the same wavelength at which they appear brightest. So I think that implies that the observed λ_max is same, which leads us to account for the Doppler shift in the calculation of their actual temperatures.

So, having T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

So, T2 is slightly higher than T1.

Now, to calculate luminosity, L is proportional to R² T⁴.

We know that R1 = 1.5 R2.

Wait, wait, the problem says Star_1 has radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2.

So R2 = R1 / 1.5.

Wait, no, wait, Star_1's radius is 1.5 times Star_2's. So R1 = 1.5 * R2.

So R2 = R1 / 1.5.

So, when calculating L1 and L2, we can write:

L1 = 4π R1² σ T1⁴

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2⁴

So, the ratio L1/L2 is (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴) )

Substituting R1 = 1.5 R2,

= ( (1.5 R2)² * T1⁴ ) / ( R2² * T2⁴ )

= ( (2.25 R2²) * T1⁴ ) / ( R2² * T2⁴ )

= 2.25 * (T1/T2)^4

Wait, because (T1^4)/(T2^4) = (T1/T2)^4.

Wait, but from earlier, T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

So, T2 = T1 * factor, where factor is sqrt(1.0046666) ≈ 1.00233.

So T1/T2 = 1/ (1.00233) ≈ 0.99767.

So,

(T1 / T2) = 1 / (1.00233) ≈ 0.99767

So,

(T1/T2)^4 ≈ (0.99767)^4

Let me compute that.

0.99767^2 = approx (1 - 0.00233)^2 = 1 - 2 * 0.00233 + (0.00233)^2 ≈ 0.99534. Hmm, but wait, 0.99767 squared is (0.99767 * 0.99767). Let me compute:

0.99767 * 0.99767:

Calculate 1 - 0.00233 = 0.99767.

(0.99767)^2 = 1 - 2*(0.00233) + (0.00233)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.00466 + 0.0000054289 ≈ 0.995345.

So (0.99767)^2 ≈ 0.995345.

Now, (0.995345)^2: that's (0.995345)^2 ≈ (1 - 0.004655)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.004655 + (0.004655)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.00931 + 0.00002166 ≈ 0.99069156.

So (0.99767)^4 ≈ approximately 0.99069.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.99069 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ Let's compute that.

2.25 * 0.9907 = ?

2.25 * 1 = 2.25.

2.25 * 0.0093 = approx 0.02085.

So 2.25 - 0.02085 ≈ 2.22915.

So approximately 2.229.

Wait, but the options are:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

So 2.229 is approximately 2.23, which is option D.

But wait, I think I made an approximation earlier. Let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, beta is 700 km/s. So let's compute beta more accurately.

v = 700 km/s.

c = 299792 km/s (exact value is about 299,792.458 km/s).

So beta = 700 / 299792.458 ≈ 0.002337.

So,

(1 + beta) = 1.002337.

(1 - beta) = 0.997663.

So, (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) = 1.002337 / 0.997663.

Let me compute this ratio.

1.002337 / 0.997663 ≈ 1.004688.

So sqrt(1.004688) = ?

Let me compute sqrt(1.004688).

We can use the Taylor expansion for square roots around 1: sqrt(1+x) ≈ 1 + x/2 - x²/8.

x = 0.004688.

sqrt(1.004688) ≈ 1 + (0.004688)/2 - (0.004688)^2 /8.

= 1 + 0.002344 - (0.00002196) /8.

Wait, 0.004688 squared is approximately (0.004688)^2 = 0.00002196.

So,

≈ 1 + 0.002344 - 0.000002745.

Which is approximately 1.002341.

So T2 = T1 * 1.002341.

So,

T1 / T2 = 1 / 1.002341 ≈ 0.99766.

So,

(T1 / T2)^4 = (0.99766)^4.

Let me compute this more accurately.

(0.99766)^2 = ?

0.99766 * 0.99766.

= (1 - 0.00234)^2 = 1 - 2*0.00234 + (0.00234)^2.

= 1 - 0.00468 + 0.000005476.

≈ 0.995325476.

Then, (0.99766)^4 = (0.995325476)^2.

Compute 0.995325^2:

= (1 - 0.004675)^2.

= 1 - 2*0.004675 + (0.004675)^2.

= 1 - 0.00935 + 0.00002186.

≈ 0.99065186.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.99065.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.99065 ≈ 2.25 * 0.99065.

Compute 2.25 * 0.99065:

2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275.

2.25 * 0.00065 = 0.0014625.

So total ≈ 2.2275 + 0.0014625 ≈ 2.22896.

Approximately 2.229, which is about 2.23.

So the answer would be option D: ~2.23.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the approach.

Another angle: perhaps the Doppler effect affects the observed temperature, but in the calculation of luminosity, the emitted temperature is what matters. Because the peak wavelength observed is the same, but the actual emitted wavelengths differ due to Doppler shift. So when calculating the luminosity based on the star's actual properties (radius and temperature), we have to use the emitted temperature, not the observed.

Wait, but the question says the astronomers computed the luminosity based on black body radiation. So they would use the observed temperature? Or the actual temperature?

Wait, no. When using the black body radiation formula, the temperature used should be the effective temperature of the star, which is the actual temperature, not the observed one. Because the observed wavelength is shifted due to Doppler, but the effective temperature is an intrinsic property.

Wait, but the astronomers are using the observed wavelengths to calculate the temperature. So if they observe the same λ_max, they would assume that both stars have the same temperature. But in reality, because of the Doppler shift, the actual temperatures are slightly different.

Wait, this could be a different approach. Let me think.

Suppose the astronomers, when calculating the temperatures, used the observed λ_max and applied Wien's law. So they would compute T_observed = b / λ_observed.

Since λ_observed is same for both stars, they would conclude that T1 = T2. But in reality, due to Doppler shift, their actual temperatures are different.

So how does this affect the calculation?

In that case, if the astronomers used the observed λ_max to compute T, they would think T1 = T2. Then, their calculation of luminosity would be based on R² * T⁴. With R1 = 1.5 R2, and T1 = T2, then L1/L2 would be (1.5)^2 = 2.25, which is option A.

But the problem states that the astronomers computed the luminosity based on black body radiation. So did they account for the Doppler shift in temperature?

Hmm, this is a critical point. The question says that the stars' wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max is same. If the astronomers used that to compute T, they would get T1 = T2.

But in reality, because of Doppler shift, the actual T of Star_2 is higher than T1.

So when the astronomers compute luminosity, which approach do they take?

The problem says "assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:"

So I think the question is telling us to compute the actual luminosity ratio, considering the Doppler effect. Because if they didn't account for Doppler, they'd think the temperatures are the same, leading to a luminosity ratio of (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

But the correct calculation should consider the actual temperatures, which are different due to Doppler shift, leading to a slightly lower factor of about 2.23 as we computed earlier.

So the correct answer would be D) ~2.23.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the luminosity ratio of Star_1 to Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for black body radiation: 

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

where \(L\) is luminosity, \(R\) is radius, \(T\) is temperature, and \(\sigma\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The luminosity ratio is therefore:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]

### Key Information:
1. **Radius**: \(R_1 = 1.5 R_2\), so \(R_2 = \frac{R_1}{1.5}\).
2. **Wavelengths**: The observed peak wavelengths (\(\lambda_{\text{max, observed}}\)) are the same for both stars. Using Wien's law, \(\lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T}\), the observed wavelength is related to the emitted wavelength by the Doppler effect.
3. **Radial Velocity**: Star_2 has a radial velocity of \(v = 700 \, \text{km/s}\), while Star_1 has zero radial velocity. The relativistic Doppler shift formula is:

\[
\frac{\lambda_{\text{observed}}}{\lambda_{\text{emitted}}} = \sqrt{\frac{1 + \beta}{1 - \beta}}, \quad \text{where } \beta = \frac{v}{c}
\]

Here, \(c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s}\), so \(\beta = \frac{700}{3 \times 10^5} \approx 0.00233\). Substituting:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{1 + \beta}{1 - \beta}} \approx \sqrt{1.0046667} \approx 1.00233
\]

Thus, the observed wavelength of Star_2 is blueshifted by a small factor compared to its emitted wavelength. Since the observed wavelengths are the same, the emitted wavelength of Star_2 is slightly shorter than that of Star_1. This implies that the actual temperature of Star_2 is slightly higher than that of Star_1.

### Temperature Ratio:
From Wien's law, the temperature ratio is inversely proportional to the wavelength ratio:

\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \sqrt{\frac{1 + \beta}{1 - \beta}} \approx 1.00233
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} \approx \frac{1}{1.00233} \approx 0.99767
\]

### Luminosity Ratio:
Substituting \(R_1 = 1.5 R_2\) and \(\frac{T_1}{T_2} \approx 0.99767\) into the luminosity ratio formula:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{(1.5 R_2)^2 (T_1)^4}{(R_2)^2 (T_2)^4} = 2.25 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

\[
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 \approx (0.99767)^4 \approx 0.99065
\]

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} \approx 2.25 \cdot 0.99065 \approx 2.229
\]

### Conclusion:
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times greater than that of Star_2, accounting for the Doppler shift affecting the temperature ratio.
