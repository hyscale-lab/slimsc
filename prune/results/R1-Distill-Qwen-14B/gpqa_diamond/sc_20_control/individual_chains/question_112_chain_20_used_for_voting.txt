Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem says that I have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. I need to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements A_ij where A_ij is hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Also, I need to find the average value of that operator. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, okay. So first, I think I need to figure out what the operator looks like. Since it's a 2x2 matrix (because it's dealing with spin-up and spin-down), and the elements are zero on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere. Wait, for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal would be (1,1) and (2,2). So the matrix A would look like:

[0     hbar/2 ]
[hbar/2  0   ]

Wait, no. Because for i≠j, A_ij is hbar/2. So the diagonal elements (i=j) are zero, and the off-diagonal are hbar/2. So yeah, that's correct.

So this operator A is probably the Pauli X matrix scaled by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and here the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. So A = (hbar/2) * σ_x.

Wait, let me confirm. σ_x is the Pauli X matrix, which has 0s on the diagonal and 1s off-diagonal. So if A is (hbar/2)σ_x, then indeed, the elements would be as described.

Now, the state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So let's normalize this state first. Because probabilities require the state to be a unit vector.

Wait, but the problem says it's proportional, so I need to find the normalization factor. Let me compute the inner product of |alpha> with itself.

The state can be written as:

|alpha> = c (1+i)|up> + d(2 -i)|down>, where c is the proportionality constant. Wait, no, the problem says it's proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>, so |alpha> = k ( (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ), where k is a normalization constant.

So the inner product <alpha|alpha> should be 1.

Let me compute that. The inner product would be:

k^2 [ (1-i)(2+i) + (2+i)(1-i) ) ] because |up> and |down> are orthonormal.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, |alpha> is a linear combination of |up> and |down>, so when taking the inner product, it's <alpha|alpha> = |k|^2 [ |1+i|^2 + |2 - i|^2 ].

Because |alpha> = k( (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ), so when you take the inner product, the cross terms vanish because <up|down> is zero. So it's |k|^2 ( |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 ).

Compute each term:

|1+i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2, since |a + bi|^2 = a² + b².

Wait, 1+i: real part 1, imaginary 1. So |1+i|² = 1² +1²=2.

Similarly, 2 - i: real 2, imaginary -1. So |2 - i|² = 2² + (-1)^2 =4+1=5.

So the sum is 2 +5=7. So <alpha|alpha> = |k|^2 *7. We set this to 1, so |k|^2 =1/7. So k=1/sqrt(7) because k is real positive.

So the normalized state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Wait, but the question is about measurement in the eigenstates of operator A. So I need to find the eigenstates of A, because when you measure an operator, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, and the probabilities are the square of the amplitudes of the corresponding eigenvectors.

Wait, right. So I can find the eigenstates of A, express |alpha> in terms of those eigenstates, and then the probabilities are the square of the coefficients.

Alternatively, since A is (hbar/2) sigma_x, its eigenstates are the same as sigma_x, because scaling by a scalar doesn't change the eigenvectors, just the eigenvalues.

Wait, what are the eigenstates of sigma_x?

The Pauli X matrix sigma_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1, and the eigenstates are |+x> and |−x>, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively.

Wait, no. Wait: The eigenstates of sigma_x are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Because sigma_x |+x> = |+x> and sigma_x |−x> = -|−x>.

So since A is (hbar/2) sigma_x, the eigenvalues of A would be (hbar/2)(+1) and (hbar/2)(-1), so hbar/2 and -hbar/2. So the eigenstates are the same as sigma_x's, scaled by the same factors.

Wait, no, the operator A is (hbar/2) sigma_x, so the eigenstates are the same as sigma_x's. So the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |−x> as before.

So to find the probability of measuring each eigenvalue, I need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x>, and then the probabilities are the squares of the coefficients.

Alternatively, I can compute the inner product of |alpha> with each eigenstate.

So let's compute the components. Let me denote |+x> as (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> as (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, I'll compute the inner product of |alpha> with |+x> and |−x>.

First, write |alpha> as:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

So, inner product with |+x>:

< +x | alpha > = [ (1/sqrt(2)) (1, 1) ] ( [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) , (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] )

Wait, perhaps more clearly, in components:

< +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| + <down| ] multiplied by ( (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down> )

So, when you take the inner product, the terms are:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) <up|up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) <down|up> + (1+i)/sqrt(7) <up|down> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) <down|down> ) ]

Since <up|up> is 1, <down|down> is 1, and <up|down> is 0.

So this simplifies to:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) ]

Because the second and fourth terms survive, others are zero.

So combine the terms:

(1 + i + 2 - i)/sqrt(7) ) = (3)/sqrt(7).

Then multiply by 1/sqrt(2):

(3)/(sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)) ) = 3/(sqrt(14)).

So the amplitude is 3/sqrt(14), so the probability is |amplitude|^2 = (9)/(14).

Wait, 3 squared is 9, and denominator (sqrt(14))² is 14. So 9/14 ≈ 0.64286.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857....

Hmm. So that's about 0.64. So the probability of getting the + eigenvalue is 9/14, and the other eigenvalue would be 5/14.

Wait, but let me check this calculation again because I might have messed up.

Wait, the inner product < +x | alpha > is (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i + 2 -i)/sqrt(7) ].

Wait, (1+i) + (2 -i) = 3, as the i's cancel out. So numerator is 3/sqrt(7), multiplied by 1/sqrt(2) → 3/(sqrt(14)).

So the square is (9)/(14) → ~0.6428, which is approximately 0.64.

Hmm, option A gives 0.64 and 0.36 which adds up to 1. Wait, but let's compute the other eigenstate.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Maybe the operator is actually different. Let me think again.

Wait, the operator A is a 2x2 matrix where A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, and zero otherwise. So the matrix is:

[ [0, hbar/2],
  [hbar/2, 0] ]

Which is a scaled version of the Pauli X matrix. So the eigenvalues of A would be the same as those of sigma_x scaled by hbar/2. So eigenvalues are (hbar/2)(1) and (hbar/2)(-1).

Now, the eigenstates of A are the same as sigma_x's, which are |+x> and |−x>.

So to find the probability, I need to find the components of |alpha> in |+x> and |−x>.

Wait, but perhaps there's another approach. Since the operator A is (hbar/2) sigma_x, the expectation value is (hbar/2) times the expectation of sigma_x in state |alpha>.

Wait, perhaps that's a simpler way to compute the expectation value, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the probabilities first.

Wait, I think the previous approach is correct, but maybe I should recompute the inner products.

Wait, so |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

The |+x> state is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

So < +x | alpha > is [ (1+i) + (2 - i) ) ] / (sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)).

Wait, wait, let me compute this step by step.

(1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> → when I take inner product with |+x>:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) <up|up> + (2 -i) <down|up> + (1+i) <up|down> + (2 -i) <down|down> ].

Wait, <up|down> is 0, so those terms vanish.

So it's (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) *1 + (2 -i)*0 + (1+i)*0 + (2 -i)*1 ]

So that's (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ].

Which is (1/sqrt(2)) [1 + i +2 -i ] → (3)/sqrt(2).

Wait, wait, no. Wait, (1+i) + (2 -i) = 3. So the numerator is 3, denominator sqrt(7) * sqrt(2).

So 3/(sqrt(14)).

So the squared magnitude is 9/14 ≈ 0.6428, which is about 0.64.

Similarly, the inner product with |−x> would be:

< −x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) <up|up> - (2 -i) <down|up> + (1+i) <up|down> - (2 -i) <down|down> ].

Wait, because |−x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). So when taking inner product, it's [ <up| - <down| ].

So when I compute <−x| alpha>, it's (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)*1 - (2 -i)*1 ].

Because <up|down> is zero, so terms involving <up|down> vanish.

So that's (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ]

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1 - 2) + (i + i) )

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (-1) + 2i ]

Which is (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(2).

The magnitude squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] / (2) → (1 +4)/2 = 5/2 → 5/2 * (1/2) ?

Wait, no. Wait, the magnitude squared of (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(2) is [ ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) ] / (2) → (1+4)/2 =5/2.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the magnitude squared is |(-1 + 2i)|^2 divided by (sqrt(2))^2=2.

So | (-1 + 2i) |^2 = (-1)^2 + (2)^2 =1 +4=5.

So the probability is 5/(2) → 5/2? No, wait, no: because 5 divided by 2 (the denominator from sqrt(2)).

Wait, no, wait, the inner product <−x| alpha> is [ (-1 +2i) ] / sqrt(2).

So the magnitude squared is [(-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] / (sqrt(2))^2 ) → (1+4)/2 =5/2. Wait, that can’t be right because probabilities can’t exceed 1.

Wait, that's impossible. So I must have made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, let me recompute this inner product.

<−x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) <up|up> - (2 -i) <down|down> ]

Wait, because |−x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So when I take inner product, I have:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) * 1 + (-1) * (2 -i) *1 ]

Because <up|up> is 1, and <down|down> is 1; the cross terms (e.g., <up|down>) vanish.

So it's (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ]

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1 -2) + (i +i) ]

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (-1) + 2i ]

Hmm, that's correct.

So the amplitude is (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(2).

The square of the magnitude is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] / 2 → (1+4)/2 =5/2 → 2.5.

But that's impossible because probabilities can't be more than 1. So, I must have made an error in the inner product calculation.

Wait a second, no. Wait, the state |alpha> is ( (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ) / sqrt(7).

So when I compute <−x| alpha>, it's:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| (1+i) |up> + <up| (2 -i)|down> (-1) ]

Wait, no. Let's do it more carefully.

<−x| alpha> = [ ( <up| - <down| ) / sqrt(2) ) ] multiplied by [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So, when you expand the inner product:

(1/(sqrt(2) * sqrt(7))) ) [ (1+i) <up|up> - (1+i) <up|down> + (2 -i) <down|up> - (2 -i) <down|down> ]

Wait, no, that looks complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to write in components.

The state |−x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, <−x| alpha> is:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) *1 + (2 -i) * (-1) ] / sqrt(7)

Because:

<up| (1+i)|up> → (1+i)*1,

and <down| (2 -i)|down> → (2 -i)* (-1) because of the |−x> state.

Wait, no, perhaps I should do it as:

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) * <up|up> + (2 -i) * <down|up> - (1+i) * <up|down> + (i -2) * <down|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should write it more systematically.

Alternatively, let me compute the product as vectors.

The state |alpha> can be represented as a vector in the basis |up>, |down>:

[ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

The state |−x> is [1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)].

The inner product is the conjugate of |−x> dotted with |alpha>.

Wait, no, the inner product is <−x| alpha> which is the conjugate transpose of |−x> multiplied by |alpha>.

So, the inner product would be:

(1/sqrt(2)) * (1) * (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (-1/sqrt(2)) * (1) * (2 -i)/sqrt(7) )

Because the first component of |−x> is 1/sqrt(2), the second is -1/sqrt(2).

So, the inner product is:

[ (1)(1+i) - (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(7)).

Compute numerator:

(1)(1+i) = 1 + i,

Minus (2 -i) → 1 +i -2 +i = (1-2) + (i +i) = -1 +2i.

So numerator is (-1 + 2i).

Denominator is sqrt(14).

So the inner product is (-1 +2i)/sqrt(14).

The magnitude squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] / 14 → (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈ 0.357.

So the probabilities are 9/14 (~0.6428) and 5/14 (~0.3571). So, the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, which matches option A.

So the probability of measuring the eigenstate corresponding to +hbar/2 is 9/14, and the other is 5/14.

Now, for the average value of operator A.

The average value is <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is (hbar/2) sigma_x, the expectation value would be (hbar/2) <alpha| sigma_x |alpha>.

But sigma_x is the Pauli X matrix, so perhaps it's easier to compute <sigma_x> and then multiply by hbar/2.

We can compute <sigma_x> as:

<sigma_x> = <alpha| sigma_x |alpha>.

But sigma_x swaps |up> and |down>, so let's compute it.

Write |alpha> as:

|alpha> = a|up> + b|down>, where a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), b = (2-i)/sqrt(7).

sigma_x |alpha> = a |down> + b |up>.

So the inner product <alpha| sigma_x |alpha> is:

a* b* <up|down> + a* a <up|up> + b* b <down|down> + a* b <up|up> ?

Wait, no, perhaps a better way is:

<alpha| sigma_x |alpha> = [ <up| a* + <down| b* ] [ a |down> + b |up> ]

= a* a <up|down> + a* b <up|up> + b* a <down|down> + b* b <down|up>.

Wait, this is getting a bit messy. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute it using matrix representation.

The operator sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]].

So, in matrix form, |alpha> is [ a, b ]^T.

Then sigma_x |alpha> is [ b, a ]^T.

So <alpha| sigma_x |alpha> = [a*, b*] [ b, a ]^T = a* b + b* a.

Which is 2 Re( a* b ), since a* b + b* a = 2 Re(a* b).

So compute a* and b.

a = (1 + i)/sqrt(7) → a* = (1 -i)/sqrt(7).

b = (2 - i)/sqrt(7) → b* = (2 +i)/sqrt(7).

So a* b = [ (1 -i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

= [ (1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i) ] / 7.

Compute numerator:

2 -i -2i + i² → 2 -3i + (-1) → (2-1) -3i → 1 -3i.

So a* b = (1 -3i)/7.

The real part of a* b is 1/7.

So 2 Re(a* b ) = 2*(1/7) = 2/7.

So <sigma_x> = 2/7.

Thus, the expectation value of A is (hbar/2) * (2/7) ) = hbar/7.

Wait, that's interesting. So the average value is hbar/7.

Looking back at the options, option A says average value is hbar/7, which matches.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 (9/14) and 0.36 (5/14), and the average is hbar/7.

Looking at the options, option A is:

A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7.

Which matches what I found.

So the correct answer is A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the probabilities of measuring an electron in the eigenstates of the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is given as \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( 0 \) otherwise. Additionally, the average value of \( A \) must be determined. The state of the electron is given as \( |\alpha\rangle \propto (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are eigenstates of the \( z \)-component of the spin operator.

### Step 1: Normalize the state \( |\alpha\rangle \)
The state is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). To normalize, compute the inner product:
\[
\langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]
Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of \( A \)
The operator \( A \) has the matrix representation:
\[
A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 \\
1 & 0
\end{bmatrix},
\]
where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli \( x \)-matrix. The eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \) are:
\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle),
\]
and the corresponding eigenvalues are \( +1 \) and \( -1 \). For \( A \), the eigenvalues are \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \).

### Step 3: Expand \( |\alpha\rangle \) in the \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) basis
The inner products of \( |\alpha\rangle \) with \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are computed as:
\[
\langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (1+i) + (2-i) \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
\langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (1+i) - (2-i) \right) = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are the squared magnitudes of these amplitudes:
\[
P(+x) = \left| \langle +x | \alpha \rangle \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(-x) = \left| \langle -x | \alpha \rangle \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 4: Average value of \( A \)
The expectation value of \( A \) is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \alpha | \sigma_x | \alpha \rangle.
\]
Using \( \sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \), the expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \langle \alpha | \sigma_x | \alpha \rangle = 2 \, \text{Re} \left( a^* b \right),
\]
where \( a = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}, b = \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \). Compute:
\[
a^* b = \frac{(1-i)(2-i)}{7} = \frac{1-3i}{7}, \quad \text{Re}(a^* b) = \frac{1}{7}.
\]
Thus:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{2}{7}, \quad \langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). This matches **Option A**.
