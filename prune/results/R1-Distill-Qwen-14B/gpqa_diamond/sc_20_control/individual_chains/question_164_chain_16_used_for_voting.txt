Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, let me try to understand what's being asked. Alright, so there are two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipsing binaries, which means their stars pass in front of each other from our point of view, causing eclipses. The periods between primary eclipses are 2 years and 1 year for system_1 and system_2 respectively.

The question is about determining by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. The mass of each system is the sum of the masses of the two stars in it. So I need to find M1 / M2, where M1 is system_1's total mass and M2 is system_2's.

The other information given is from spectroscopic observations. Both systems show radial velocity (RV) variations. For system_1, the amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, they're 15 and 10 km/s. Radial velocity amplitudes are related to the masses of the stars, I remember that much. 

Wait, how does that work exactly? Oh right, in a binary system, each star orbits the common center of mass. The more massive star will have a smaller orbit, and the less massive one a larger orbit. So the radial velocity of each star is inversely proportional to its mass. That is, the more massive star has a smaller velocity amplitude.

The formula I recall is that the ratio of the velocity amplitudes (K) of the two stars is inversely proportional to the ratio of their masses. So K1/K2 = M2/M1. So if star A has a velocity amplitude K_A and star B K_B, then K_A/K_B = M_B / M_A.

Wait, let me think again. The system's total mass is M = M1 + M2. The center of mass is such that M1 * a1 = M2 * a2, where a1 and a2 are the orbital radii. The velocities are proportional to the orbital radii divided by the orbital period. So v1 = (2π a1)/P, and similarly for v2. So v1/v2 = a1/a2 = M2/M1. So yes, the velocity amplitudes are inversely proportional to each star's mass.

But in the given data for each system, we have the two velocity amplitudes. For system_1, the velocities are 10 and 5. So what's the ratio? 10/5 = 2. So K1/K2 is 2. Then M2/M1 = K1/K2 = 2. So M1/M2 = 1/2. Wait, no, because M2/M1 = K1/K2. So M1 = M2 * (K2 / K1). Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the mass function.

Wait, another approach. The mass function in binary stars relates the observed velocities to the mass. I think the formula is something like (M2^3 sin i)/( (M1 + M2)^2 ) = (P K1^3)/(2π G). But wait, maybe I don't need to go that far. Since both systems have their own RV curves, perhaps I can find their mass ratios and then compute the total masses.

Alternatively, since the periods are given, and the RV amplitudes, perhaps I can find the mass function for each system and then find the masses.

Wait, the period is the same for both stars in a binary system because they orbit each other. So the period P is the same for both stars in a system. So for each system, the two stars have the same period, which is given as 2 years for system_1 and 1 year for system_2.

Wait, wait. Wait a second. The period of the eclipses is the orbital period, right? Because each time the same alignment happens (primary eclipse), so the period is the orbital period. So system_1's orbital period is 2 years, system_2's is 1 year.

Alright, for each system, you have two stars orbiting each other with their own masses. The velocity amplitudes for each star are given. Let me denote for system_1: K1a =10 km/s, K1b=5 km/s. For system_2: K2a=15, K2b=10.

In a binary system, the ratio of the velocities of the two stars is inversely proportional to their mass ratio. So, K1b / K1a = M1a / M1b, where M1a and M1b are the masses of the two stars in system_1. Similarly, K2b/K2a = M2a / M2b.

Wait, let's think about system_1: the two velocity amplitudes are 10 and 5. So K1a = 10, K1b=5. So the velocity ratio is 10/5 = 2. So M1b / M1a = 2. So M1b = 2 M1a. Because the velocity is inversely proportional to mass. Wait, K1a is the velocity of star a, and K1b is velocity of star b. So if K1a > K1b, then star a is less massive than star b.

So M1a / M1b = K1b / K1a. So M1a / M1b = 5/10 = 0.5. So M1a = 0.5 M1b. So the mass ratio is M1a : M1b = 1 : 2. So the total mass of system_1 is M1 = M1a + M1b = (0.5 +1) M1b = 1.5 M1b.

Similarly, for system_2, K2a=15, K2b=10. So K2a/K2b =15/10=1.5. So M2b / M2a =1.5. So M2b = 1.5 M2a. So the mass ratio is M2a : M2b = 1 : 1.5.

Total mass M2 = M2a + M2b =1 +1.5 = 2.5 M2a.

Wait, but how does this relate to the period? Because the period affects the mass function. Hmm, I think the period is involved in the mass function equation. Let me recall the mass function formula.

The mass function is given by: f(M) = (K^3 P) / (2π G) = (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

But since we don't know the inclination i, but since it's an eclipsing binary, the inclination is close to 90 degrees, so sin i is 1. So we can ignore that term. So f(M) = (M2^3) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ) = (K1^3 P) / (2π G) 

Wait, but for each system, we have two K's. So perhaps we have f(M1) and f(M2) for each system, but I'm not sure how to proceed.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that for each system, the more massive star has the smaller velocity. So in system_1, the star with K=5 is more massive than the star with K=10. So M1b (5 km/s) is more massive than M1a (10 km/s). So M1a is 0.5 M1b.

Similarly, in system_2, the star with K=10 is more massive than the one with K=15. So M2b (10) is more massive than M2a (15). Wait, wait, no, wait. If K is the velocity amplitude, then K is inversely proportional to mass. So a higher K means lower mass.

So K1a is 10, so M1a is less than M1b. K1b is 5, so M1b is larger. So M1a = (5/10) M1b = 0.5 M1b.

Similarly, system_2: K2a=15, K2b=10. So M2a is less than M2b. So M2a = (10/15) M2b = (2/3) M2b.

So in system_1, M1a =0.5 M1b. So the mass ratio q1 = M1a/M1b =0.5. So M1a =0.5 M1b.

In system_2, M2a = (2/3) M2b. So q2= M2a/M2b= 2/3.

Now, each system's total mass is M1 = M1a + M1b = 0.5 M1b + M1b = 1.5 M1b.

Similarly, M2 = M2a + M2b = (2/3) M2b + M2b = (5/3) M2b.

But how do we relate this to determine the total masses?

Wait, I think we need to use the period. Because the period is the same for both stars in a system. The period is related to the total mass of the system. The formula for the orbital period of a binary system is given by Kepler's law: P^2 = (4π²/(G(M1 + M2))) a^3, where a is the separation between the two stars.

But I'm not sure how to apply that here because I don't have the separation a. But wait, perhaps instead I can relate the velocities and the period to find the masses.

The velocity of each star is given by v = 2π a / P. But a is the semi-major axis. Alternatively, the velocity is also related to the mass ratio.

Wait, another approach: using the fact that the center of mass is stationary, the velocities are inversely proportional to the masses. So for system_1, M1a / M1b = K1b / K1a = 5/10 = 0.5. So M1a =0.5 M1b.

Similarly for system_2, M2a / M2b = K2b / K2a =10/15= 2/3. So M2a= (2/3) M2b.

But without knowing the actual masses, how can we find the ratio of the total masses?

Wait, maybe I should think about the mass function for each system.

The mass function f(M) is given by f(M) = (K^3 P) / (2π G), where K is the semi-amplitude of the velocity curve, and P is the orbital period.

But each system has two stars, so each has two Ks. But the mass function depends on the mass of the companion. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Wait, let me think again. For each system, the mass function is the same regardless of which star's velocity you use, because it depends on the mass of the other star, I think.

Hmm, maybe not. Let's clarify. The mass function is defined as:

f(M) = ( (K1^3 P) ) / (2 π G )

But wait, actually, for a binary system, the mass function is given by:

f(M) = ( (K^3 P) ) / (2 π G ) = ( ( (2 π a sin i ) / P )^3 ) * P ) / (2 π G )

But perhaps I'm getting off track.

Alternatively, the mass function for a star in a binary system is:

f(M) = (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

Where M2 is the mass of the companion.

But since we don't know the inclination, but for eclipsing binaries, sin i is approximately 1.

So for system_1, using the velocity data, perhaps I can write the mass functions for each star and then relate them.

Wait, but each star's velocity gives the same mass function. Because they're orbiting each other, the mass function depends on the mass of the other star. So for system_1, the mass function can be written in two ways.

Let me denote:

For system_1:

f1a = (M1b^3) / ( (M1a + M1b)^2 ) = ( (K1a)^3 P1 ) / (2 π G )

f1b = (M1a^3) / ( (M1a + M1b)^2 ) = ( (K1b)^3 P1 ) / (2 π G )

So f1a = (M1b^3)/(M1^2) = (K1a^3 P1 )/(2 π G )

f1b = (M1a^3)/(M1^2) = (K1b^3 P1 )/(2 π G )

So f1a / f1b = (M1b^3 / M1^2) / ( M1a^3 / M1^2 ) ) = (M1b/M1a)^3 = (K1a^3 / K1b^3 )

From earlier, M1a = 0.5 M1b. So M1b/M1a = 2.

So (M1b/M1a)^3 = 8.

So f1a / f1b = (K1a/K1b)^3 = (10/5)^3 = 8.

Which matches because (10/5)^3 is 8.

So that's consistent, but doesn't help us find the actual masses.

Alternatively, perhaps we can relate the mass functions of the two systems.

Let me think about the mass functions for system_1 and system_2.

For system_1, using either of the two velocities, the mass function would be:

f1 = (K1a^3 P1 )/(2 π G ) = (10^3 * 2 )/(2 π G ) = (1000 * 2 ) / ( ... )

Similarly, for system_2, f2 = (K2a^3 P2 )/(2 π G ) = (15^3 * 1 ) / ( ... )

But since G is a constant and π cancels out, the ratio f1/f2 can be computed.

Wait, but the mass functions are f1 = (M1b^3)/(M1^2) ) and f2 = (M2b^3)/(M2^2) ).

But our goal is to find M1 / M2. Hmm.

Alternatively, since f(M) = (M2^3)/( (M1 + M2)^2 ), and M1 and M2 are the two masses in the system.

Wait, in this context, which star is which? Let me clarify:

In system_1, the two stars have masses M1a and M1b, with M1a=0.5 M1b.

The mass function for each star is f1a = (M1b^3)/( (M1a + M1b)^2 ), which is ( (M1b)^3 )/( (1.5 M1b)^2 )= ( M1b^3 )/( 2.25 M1b^2 ) )= M1b / 2.25.

Similarly, f1b = (M1a^3)/( (M1a + M1b)^2 ) = (0.5^3 M1b^3 )/( (1.5 M1b)^2 ) = (0.125 M1b^3 )/( 2.25 M1b^2 ) ) = 0.125 M1b / 2.25 = M1b * 0.05555...

But from the velocity data, and the formula f = (K^3 P)/(2 π G ), the f values are related to the observed velocities.

So for system_1, using star a's velocity:

f1a = (10^3 * 2 )/(2 π G ) = (2000 )/(2 π G ) = 1000/( π G )

Similarly, f1b = (5^3 * 2 )/(2 π G )= (125 *2 )/(2 π G )= 125/( π G )

Wait, but according to the earlier calculation, f1a = M1b / 2.25, and f1b = M1b * (0.05555).

So let's compute f1a and f1b using the velocity formula.

f1a (from velocity) = 1000/(π G )

f1b (from velocity) = 125/(π G )

Now, from the mass function expressions:

f1a = M1b / 2.25 → M1b = f1a * 2.25 = (1000/(π G )) * 2.25 = 2250/(π G )

Similarly, f1b = M1b * (0.05555) = (2250/(π G )) * (1/18) ) → because 0.05555 is 1/18.

Wait, 0.05555 is approximately 1/18, which is 0.055555...

So f1b = 2250/(π G ) * (1/18) )= 125/(π G ), which matches the velocity-based calculation. So that's consistent.

So we can find M1b in terms of G, but we don't know G, but perhaps when we take the ratio between systems, the constants will cancel.

Similarly, let's compute for system_2.

In system_2, the two stars have velocity amplitudes K2a=15, K2b=10. Period P2=1 year.

So f2a = (15^3 *1 )/(2 π G )= 3375/(2 π G )

f2b = (10^3 *1 )/(2 π G )= 1000/(2 π G )=500/(π G )

But from the mass function expressions, for system_2:

We have M2a = (2/3) M2b. So M2a + M2b = (2/3 M2b) + M2b = (5/3) M2b. So M2 = 5/3 M2b.

The mass function for star a (using K2a=15) is:

f2a = (M2b^3)/( (M2a + M2b)^2 ) = ( M2b^3 ) / ( (5/3 M2b )^2 ) ) = ( M2b^3 ) / ( (25/9) M2b^2 ) ) = (9/25) M2b.

Similarly, the mass function from velocity:

f2a = 3375/(2 π G )

So (9/25) M2b = 3375/(2 π G )

→ M2b = (3375/(2 π G )) * (25/9) )= (3375 *25 )/( 2 π G *9 ) )

Compute that:

3375 /9 = 375, 375 *25=9375. So M2b= 9375/(2 π G )

Similarly, for system_1, M1b =2250/(π G )

So M1b = 2250/(π G )

M2b = 9375/(2 π G )

So M1b / M2b = (2250/(π G )) / (9375/(2 π G )) )= (2250 * 2 ) / 9375 = 4500 /9375 = 4500 ÷9375.

Divide numerator and denominator by 75: 4500/75=60, 9375/75=125.

So 60 /125 = 12/25 = 0.48.

So M1b = 0.48 * M2b.

But wait, M1 is the sum of M1a and M1b. M1a is 0.5 M1b, so M1 = 0.5 M1b + M1b = 1.5 M1b.

Similarly, M2 = (5/3) M2b.

Now, M1 =1.5 M1b =1.5 * 0.48 M2b =0.72 M2b.

And M2 = (5/3) M2b ≈1.6667 M2b.

So the ratio M1 / M2 = (0.72 M2b ) / (1.6667 M2b ) )= 0.72 /1.6667 ≈0.432.

Wait, that's approximately 0.43. Looking at the options, option A is ~0.4, option B is ~0.6.

Wait, but I might have made a miscalculation. Let me double-check.

Compute M1b / M2b again:

M1b =2250/(π G )

M2b= 9375/(2 π G )

So the ratio is (2250 / π G ) / [9375/(2 π G ) ] = (2250 * 2 ) /9375 = 4500 /9375.

4500 ÷ 9375: Let's compute that.

Divide numerator and denominator by 75: 4500 ÷75=60, 9375 ÷75=125. So 60/125= 0.48. So M1b =0.48 M2b.

So M1 =1.5 M1b =1.5 *0.48 M2b=0.72 M2b.

M2 = (5/3) M2b ≈1.6667 M2b.

M1 / M2 =0.72 /1.6667 ≈0.432.

Which is about 0.43, which is close to option A (0.4) and option B (0.6). Hmm, but 0.43 is closer to 0.4 than to 0.6.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the mass function approach. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the mass function ratio.

For system_1, f1 = (K1a^3 P1 )/(2 π G )= (10^3 * 2)/(2 π G )= (2000 )/(2 π G )= 1000/( π G )

For system_2, f2 = (K2a^3 P2 )/(2 π G )= (15^3 *1)/(2 π G )= 3375/(2 π G )= 1687.5/( π G )

So f1/f2 = [1000/(π G ) ] / [1687.5/(π G ) ] = 1000/1687.5= approx 0.5925.

So f1/f2 ≈0.5925.

But f(M) is (M2^3)/( (M1 + M2)^2 ) for each system.

So for system_1, f1 = (M1b^3)/( (M1a + M1b)^2 )= (M1b^3)/( (1.5 M1b)^2 )= M1b / 2.25. So f1 = M1b/2.25.

Similarly, system_2: f2 = (M2b^3)/( (M2a + M2b)^2 )= (M2b^3)/( ( (5/3) M2b )^2 )= M2b^3 / ( (25/9) M2b^2 )= (9/25) M2b.

So f1 = M1b/2.25, f2= (9/25) M2b.

So f1/f2 = (M1b/2.25 ) / ( (9/25) M2b ) )= (M1b *25 )/(2.25 *9 * M2b ) )

Simplify denominator: 2.25 *9 =20.25.

So f1/f2 = (25 M1b )/(20.25 M2b ) )= (25/20.25) (M1b/M2b )

We found earlier that M1b/M2b=0.48, so:

f1/f2= (25/20.25) *0.48 = (approx 1.2345) *0.48 ≈ 0.5925.

Which matches our earlier calculation of f1/f2=0.5925.

But how does this help us find M1/M2? Because f1 and f2 are functions of the component masses.

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Let's consider the mass functions.

We have f1 = M1b / 2.25.

From the velocity data, f1 = (10^3 *2 )/(2 π G )=1000/( π G )

So M1b = 2.25 * f1 =2.25 * 1000/( π G )=2250/( π G )

Similarly, system_2: f2 = (15^3 *1 )/(2 π G )=3375/(2 π G )= 1687.5/( π G )

And f2 = (9/25) M2b.

So M2b= (25/9) f2 = (25/9) *1687.5/( π G )= (25 *1687.5 )/(9 π G )

Compute that numerator: 25 *1687.5=42187.5.

Divide by 9: 42187.5 /9 =4687.5.

So M2b=4687.5/( π G )

Now, M1b is 2250/( π G )

So M1b is (2250)/( π G ), M2b is 4687.5/( π G )

So the ratio M1b/M2b = 2250 /4687.5 = 0.48.

So M1b =0.48 M2b.

Now, M1 = M1a + M1b =0.5 M1b + M1b=1.5 M1b=1.5 *0.48 M2b=0.72 M2b.

M2 = M2a + M2b= (2/3)M2b + M2b= (5/3) M2b≈1.6667 M2b.

So M1 / M2 = (0.72 M2b )/(1.6667 M2b )=0.72 / 1.6667.

Compute 0.72 divided by 1.6667.

Well, 1.6667 is approximately 5/3.

So 0.72 / (5/3) =0.72 *3/5 =2.16/5=0.432.

So ~0.43.

The options are A) ~0.4, B) ~0.6, etc.

So 0.43 is closest to option A (~0.4), but let me check the calculation again.

Wait, what is the exact value of 0.72 / 1.6666667?

Let me compute:

1.6666667 is 5/3. So 0.72 / (5/3) = 0.72 *3/5 = 2.16/5= 0.432.

So approximately 0.43, which is closer to 0.4 than to 0.5. So the correct answer would be option A, ~0.4.

Wait, but wait. Did I mix up M1 and M2? Because sometimes the way the velocities are taken can affect which system is which.

Wait, in system_1, the period is 2 years, and the velocities are 10 and 5. In system_2, period is 1 year, velocities 15 and10. So perhaps I should think about the mass functions for each system.

Wait, another approach. Let me think about the formula that relates the mass function to the period and velocities.

For a binary system, the mass function is given by:

f(M) = (K^3 P) / (2 π G )

But f(M) is (M2 sin i )^3/( (M1 + M2 )^2 )

Assuming i=90 degrees, sin i=1, so f(M)= (M2^3) / ( (M1 + M2 )^2 )

So for each system, I can write:

For system_1:

f1 = (M1b^3)/( (M1a + M1b)^2 ) = (10^3 *2 )/(2 π G )= 2000/(2 π G )=1000/( π G )

Similarly, for system_2:

f2 = (M2b^3)/( (M2a + M2b)^2 )= (15^3 *1 )/(2 π G )= 3375/(2 π G )= 1687.5/( π G )

Now, express the system masses:

System_1: M1a =0.5 M1b → M1 =1.5 M1b.

System_2: M2a = (2/3) M2b → M2 = (5/3) M2b.

Now, let's express f1 and f2 in terms of M1 and M2.

For system_1:

f1 = (M1b^3)/( (1.5 M1b)^2 )= (M1b^3 )/( 2.25 M1b^2 )= M1b / 2.25.

Similarly, for system_2:

f2 = (M2b^3 )/( (5/3 M2b )^2 )= (M2b^3 )/( (25/9 M2b^2 ) )= (9/25) M2b.

So from f1 = M1b / 2.25 → M1b =2.25 f1.

Similarly, M2b= (25/9) f2.

Now, let's compute M1 and M2 in terms of f1 and f2.

M1 =1.5 M1b =1.5 *2.25 f1 =3.375 f1.

M2= (5/3) M2b = (5/3) * (25/9) f2 )= (125/27) f2 ≈4.6296 f2.

But f1 and f2 are known in terms of velocities and periods.

f1=1000/( π G )

f2=1687.5/( π G )

So M1=3.375 * (1000/( π G )) =3375/( π G )

M2= (125/27) * (1687.5/( π G ))= (125 *1687.5 )/(27 π G )

Compute 125 *1687.5: 

1687.5 *100=168750, 1687.5 *25=42187.5 → total 210937.5.

Divide by 27: 210937.5 /27 ≈7812.5.

So M2=7812.5/( π G )

Now, M1=3375/( π G ), M2=7812.5/( π G )

So the ratio M1/M2 = 3375 /7812.5 = ?

3375 ÷7812.5.

Let me compute:

Divide numerator and denominator by 125: 3375/125=27, 7812.5 /125=62.5.

So 27/62.5= 0.432.

So M1 is 0.432 times M2, which is about 0.43.

Looking back at the options:

A) ~0.4

B) ~0.6

C) ~1.2

D) ~0.7

So the closest is A) ~0.4.

Wait, but why is system_1 less massive than system_2? Let me think about the velocities and periods.

System_1 has a longer period (2 years) and lower velocities (10 and 5). System_2 has a shorter period (1 year) and higher velocities (15 and10).

Higher velocities would suggest lower mass stars because higher velocity implies lower mass (since velocity is inversely proportional to mass for a given period). But wait, in that case, system_2's stars are less massive, so their total mass would be lower. But according to the calculation, system_1 is less massive than system_2.

Wait, but according to our calculation, system_1's mass is about 0.43 times that of system_2. So system_1 is less massive.

But from the velocity amplitudes: system_2's velocities are higher, which would imply lower masses. So their total mass would be lower. But our calculation says system_1 is less massive. Hmm, that seems conflicting. Did I get the ratio backwards?

Wait, wait. Let me make sure. The ratio M1/M2 is ~0.43. So M1 is about 0.43 times M2. So system_1 is less massive than system_2. Which would imply that system_2 is more massive.

But wait, system_2 has higher velocities. So each star is less massive, which would lead to a lower total mass. But according to our calculation, system_2 has a higher mass. That seems contradictory. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, no. Let me think. The higher velocities in system_2 imply that each star is less massive. Because velocity is inversely proportional to mass. So if system_2's stars have higher velocities, they must be less massive. So their total mass would be less than that of system_1, which has lower velocities implying more massive stars.

Wait, but according to the calculation, system_1 is less massive than system_2. That's confusing. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the mass function again. Because the mass function f(M) for each system depends on the cube of the companion's mass.

Wait, for a given velocity and period, a larger mass function would imply a more massive companion.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try another approach.

Alternative approach: For each system, the mass function is f(M) = (K^3 P)/(2 π G )

So for system_1, f1 = (10^3 *2)/(2 π G )=2000/(2 π G )=1000/(π G )

For system_2, f2= (15^3 *1 )/(2 π G )=3375/(2 π G )=1687.5/(π G )

So f2/f1=1687.5/1000=1.6875.

f(M) is (M2^3)/( (M1 + M2 )^2 )

So f2/f1= [ (M2b^3/(M2^2 )) ] / [ (M1b^3/(M1^2 )) ] = ( M2b^3 M1^2 )/( M1b^3 M2^2 )

But M1=1.5 M1b.

M2= (5/3) M2b.

So substituting these in:

= [ M2b^3 * (1.5 M1b )^2 ] / [ M1b^3 * (5/3 M2b )^2 ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator.

Numerator: M2b^3 * (2.25 M1b^2 )

Denominator: M1b^3 * (25/9 M2b^2 )

So:

= [ M2b^3 *2.25 M1b^2 ] / [ M1b^3 * (25/9) M2b^2 ]

Simplify:

M2b^3 / M2b^2 = M2b.

M1b^2 / M1b^3 = 1/(M1b )

2.25 / (25/9) )= 2.25 *9/25= (20.25)/25= 0.81.

So putting it all together:

= M2b / M1b * 0.81.

So f2/f1= (M2b / M1b ) * 0.81.

But earlier, f2/f1=1.6875.

So:

1.6875= (M2b / M1b ) *0.81 → M2b/M1b =1.6875/0.81≈2.083.

So M2b≈2.083 M1b.

Now, from system_1:

M1=1.5 M1b.

From system_2:

M2= (5/3) M2b ≈(5/3)*2.083 M1b≈3.472 M1b.

So M1=1.5 M1b, M2=3.472 M1b.

Thus, M1/M2=1.5 / 3.472≈0.432.

So again, the same result.

But according to this, system_1 is less massive than system_2. But system_2 has higher velocities, which suggests the stars are less massive, which would make their total mass lower. So why is system_2 more massive?

Wait, perhaps because the period is shorter. Let's think about the period and velocity.

The formula for orbital velocity is v= (2 π a )/P.

So for a given a (separation), a shorter period P leads to higher velocity. But Kepler's third law says that P^2 = (4 π² a^3)/( G (M1 + M2) )

So for a given a, a larger M would give a longer period. So a shorter period would imply a smaller a or a smaller sum of masses.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit lost. Let me think again.

In our calculation, system_2 is more massive than system_1. But system_2 has higher velocities, which would imply lower individual masses. So why is the total mass higher?

Because I think the period plays a significant role here. Let me try to see.

The velocity of each star is v= (2 π a )/(P ), where a is the semi-major axis of the star's orbit.

But from center of mass, a1 + a2 = a (the separation), and M1 a1 = M2 a2.

So a1 = (M2/(M1+M2)) a.

Similarly, a2= (M1/(M1+M2)) a.

So the velocity of each star is v1=2 π a1 /P = (2 π a M2 )/( P (M1+M2) )

Similarly, v2= (2 π a M1 )/( P (M1+M2) )

So v1 / v2 = M2 / M1.

Which brings us back to the earlier conclusion that the velocity ratio is inverse of the mass ratio.

But velocity is also proportional to (a/(P)), and a is related to the total mass and period via Kepler's law.

So a^3 = [ G (M1 + M2) P^2 ]/(4 π² )

So a = [ G (M1 + M2) P^2/(4 π² ) ]^(1/3 )

Substituting into v1:

v1= [2 π * a1 ] / P = [2 π * (M2 a )/(M1 + M2) ) ] / P 

But a is expressed in terms of M and P.

So v1= [2 π (M2/(M1+M2)) * ( [ G (M) P^2/(4 π² ) ]^(1/3 ) ) ) ] / P

Where M = M1 + M2.

This simplifies to:

v1= (2 π M2 )/(M) ) * [ G M P^2/(4 π² ) ]^(1/3 ) / P 

Simplify the expression inside the brackets:

[ G M P^2/(4 π² ) ]^(1/3 ) = ( G M )^(1/3 ) (P^2 )^(1/3 ) / (4 π² )^(1/3 )

So v1= (2 π M2 )/(M ) ) * [ (G M )^(1/3 ) (P^(2/3 )) ] / (4 π² )^(1/3 ) ) / P 

Simplify the terms:

= (2 π M2 )/(M ) ) * ( G^(1/3) M^(1/3) P^(2/3) ) / (4^(1/3) π^(2/3) ) ) ) * (1/P )

= (2 π M2 )/(M ) ) * ( G^(1/3) M^(1/3) P^(2/3) ) ) / (4^(1/3) π^(2/3) P )

= (2 π M2 )/(M ) ) * G^(1/3) M^(1/3) P^(2/3 -1) ) / (4^(1/3) π^(2/3) )

Simplify exponents:

P^(2/3 -1) = P^(-1/3 )

M in denominator is M = M1 + M2. M^(1/3) in numerator.

So M^(1/3) / M = M^(-2/3 )

Putting it all together:

v1 = [2 π M2 G^(1/3) ] / [ M^(2/3) 4^(1/3) π^(2/3) ) ] * P^(-1/3 )

Simplify constants:

2 / (4^(1/3) ) = 2 / (2^(2/3) ) )= 2^(1 - 2/3 )= 2^(1/3 )

π / π^(2/3 )= π^(1 - 2/3 )= π^(1/3 )

So:

v1= [ 2^(1/3) π^(1/3) G^(1/3) M2 ] / [ M^(2/3) ] * P^(-1/3 )

Factor out ( G M P^2 )^(1/3 ), but perhaps it's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express v in terms of M and P.

But I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the ratio of M1 and M2.

In our previous calculation, we found M1/M2 ≈ 0.43, which is roughly 0.4. So the correct option is A.

To determine by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, we analyze the given data using the relationship between radial velocity (RV) amplitudes, orbital periods, and stellar masses. The key steps are as follows:

### Key Observations and Relationships:
1. **Radial Velocity and Mass Ratio**: In a binary system, the velocity amplitudes of the two stars are inversely proportional to their masses. For system_1, the velocity amplitudes are \( K_1 = 10 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( K_2 = 5 \, \text{km/s} \), giving a mass ratio \( M_{1a}/M_{1b} = K_2/K_1 = 5/10 = 0.5 \). Similarly, for system_2, the velocity amplitudes are \( K_1 = 15 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( K_2 = 10 \, \text{km/s} \), giving \( M_{2a}/M_{2b} = K_2/K_1 = 10/15 = 0.6667 \).

2. **Total Mass of Each System**:
   - For system_1, \( M_1 = M_{1a} + M_{1b} = 0.5M_{1b} + M_{1b} = 1.5M_{1b} \).
   - For system_2, \( M_2 = M_{2a} + M_{2b} = 0.6667M_{2b} + M_{2b} = 1.6667M_{2b} \).

3. **Mass Function and Period**:
   The mass function relates the observed velocities and orbital periods to the masses:
   \[
   f(M) = \frac{K^3 P}{2 \pi G}
   \]
   For system_1:
   \[
   f_1 = \frac{(10)^3 (2)}{2 \pi G} = \frac{2000}{2 \pi G} = \frac{1000}{\pi G}
   \]
   For system_2:
   \[
   f_2 = \frac{(15)^3 (1)}{2 \pi G} = \frac{3375}{2 \pi G} = \frac{1687.5}{\pi G}
   \]

4. **Mass Function Ratio**:
   The ratio of the mass functions is:
   \[
   \frac{f_1}{f_2} = \frac{\frac{1000}{\pi G}}{\frac{1687.5}{\pi G}} = \frac{1000}{1687.5} \approx 0.5925
   \]

5. **Relating Mass Functions to Total Masses**:
   Using the mass function formula \( f(M) = \frac{M_2^3}{(M_1 + M_2)^2} \), the total masses of the systems can be expressed in terms of their respective mass functions. After substituting the values and simplifying, the total mass ratio is found to be:
   \[
   \frac{M_1}{M_2} \approx 0.43
   \]

### Conclusion:
System_1 is approximately 0.43 times as massive as system_2. Among the given options, the closest value is **A) ~0.4**.
