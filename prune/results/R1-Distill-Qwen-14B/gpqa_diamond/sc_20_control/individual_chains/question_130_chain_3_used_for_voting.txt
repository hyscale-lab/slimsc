Okay, so I've got this question about redshift and detecting quasars with neutral hydrogen clouds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astrophysics, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. We need to find the lower limit on the redshift so that these objects can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.

Wait, I remember that the Lyman alpha emission line is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. Oh right, because hydrogen's Lyman series transitions are in UV. But wait, when a cloud absorbs this light from a quasar, it's causing an absorption line. So the quasar's light is at a wavelength longer than the rest wavelength if it's redshifted.

But why are we talking about redshift? Because the quasar is moving away, so its emitted light is stretched. So the Lyman alpha line would be observed at a longer wavelength than 1216 Angstroms, right? So the observed wavelength would be lambda = rest wavelength * (1 + z), where z is the redshift.

But wait, what's the issue with optical telescopes? Optical telescopes can't see UV light because the atmosphere blocks it. So if the quasar's Lyman alpha line is observed in the optical range, that would mean it's redshifted enough to move into the visible spectrum.

So the key here is to find the redshift where the Lyman alpha wavelength shifts from UV to optical. Let's think about the wavelengths. Optical wavelengths are roughly from 400 nm to about 700 nm. But wait, wait, the Lyman alpha is 1216 Angstroms, which is 121.6 nm. Oh wait, 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm, so 1216 A is 121.6 nm. That's in the far UV.

To get this into the optical range, let's see. Suppose the observed wavelength after redshift is in the optical, say around 400 nm to 700 nm. Let's pick the lowest part, 400 nm, to find the minimal redshift that allows the line to be in optical.

So, using the formula lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + z). We want lambda_obs >= 400 nm.

Wait, lambda_rest is 121.6 nm. So setting 121.6 * (1 + z) = 400. Let's solve for z.

(1 + z) = 400 / 121.6 ≈ 3.29. So z ≈ 2.29. But wait, wait, 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms. Oh wait no, 1 nm is 10 Angstroms, so 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms. So when I set lambda_obs to 4000 A, then 4000 = 1216 * (1 + z). So 1 + z = 4000 / 1216 ≈ 3.29. So z ≈ 2.29.

But wait, optical telescopes typically start at around 400 nm (violet) up. So if the Lyman alpha line is redshifted to 400 nm, that's the lower limit for optical. So anything above that would be in optical and detectable.

So the minimal redshift is around 2.29. But let's check the options. The options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

Hmm, 2.29 is close to option C which is 2.4, but wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate.

Wait, 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm. Let me compute 4000 A / 1216 A. 4000/1216 is approximately 3.29, so z=2.29.

But wait, the question is about the lower limit. So a redshift lower than that would mean the observed wavelength is shorter than 4000 A, which is 400 nm. But ground-based optical telescopes can't observe wavelengths below about 300 nm (since the atmosphere blocks UV). Wait, no, wait. Wait, the atmosphere is opaque to a lot of UV, but for ground-based telescopes, the optical range they can observe is from about 400 nm (violet) upwards. So anything below 400 nm (like in UV) isn't observable from the ground.

Wait, but wait another point. The Lyman alpha line is at 1216 A (121.6 nm), which is in the far UV. When the quasar is at a certain redshift, this line is redshifted into the optical. So if the quasar's redshift is z, then lambda_obs = 1216*(1+z) A.

Wait, but optical telescopes can't observe wavelengths lower than about 300 nm (that's 3000 A). So for 1216*(1+z) to be 3000 A, let's compute.

3000 = 1216*(1+z)
1+z = 3000/1216 ≈ 2.468
z ≈ 1.468.

Hmmm, wait, that would be lower than some of the options. But I'm getting confused.

Wait, I'm probably making a mistake here. Let me clarify: The Lyman alpha line is emitted at 1216 A (121.6 nm). For a distant quasar, this line is redshifted. If the quasar is at redshift z, then the observed wavelength is 1216*(1+z) A.

Ground-based optical telescopes can't observe wavelengths beyond about 300 nm (3000 A) because the atmosphere (ozone layer?) blocks UV. So for the Lyman alpha line to be in the optical, it must be redshifted beyond 3000 A.

Wait, no. Because if the observed wavelength is longer than 3000 A (say, 3000 A is 300 nm), then it's in the near UV, which ground-based telescopes can't observe. So if the observed wavelength is longer than 4000 A (400 nm), which is visible (violet), then the optical telescope can see it.

Wait, no, the atmosphere is opaque to a lot of UV, but what's the cutoff? I think the atmospheric transmission is low for wavelengths below about 300 nm (3000 A). So for the quasar's Lyman alpha to be observable, the redshift must be such that the observed wavelength is longer than 3000 A. Because anything longer than that is in the optical or near-UV that can be observed.

Wait, so let me compute the redshift when 1216*(1+z) = 3000 A. So 1+z = 3000/1216 ≈ 2.467 → z ≈ 1.467.

So any redshift higher than 1.467 would shift the Lyman alpha line into wavelengths above 3000 A, which is in the near-UV or optical. So ground-based telescopes can't observe below about 3000 A, so they can detect the line if it's above that.

Wait, but wait. If the quasar's Lyman alpha line is at 3000 A, which is 300 nm, that's in the UV. And the atmosphere doesn't let that through. So ground-based telescopes can't see it. So the line must be redshifted to beyond 4000 A (400 nm) to be in the visible spectrum.

So let me recalculate when the observed wavelength is 4000 A (400 nm).

1216*(1+z) = 4000 → 1+z = 4000/1216 ≈ 3.29 → z≈2.29.

So the redshift must be at least 2.29 for the Lyman alpha line to be observed at 4000 A, which is in the visible range. So the lower limit is z≈2.29.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is close. Option D is 1.9, which is lower than 2.29. So if the quasar has a redshift of 1.9, the observed wavelength is 1216*(1+1.9)=1216*2.9=approx 3526 A, which is 352.6 nm. That's in the near-UV, which ground-based telescopes can't observe because of atmospheric absorption. So it's not detectable.

Wait, that's conflicting. So if the redshift is 2.29, the observed wavelength is 400 nm (violet), which is the lower end of optical. So the minimal redshift is around 2.29.

But wait, perhaps the question is about the lower limit, meaning the minimal z such that the line is still in the optical. So the line must be in the optical range (say, longer than 4000 A). So any z above 2.29 would work. So the lower limit is z=2.29. So the minimal z is about 2.3.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is higher than 2.29. So why isn't option C the correct answer? Because 2.4 is higher than 2.29, so it's a higher redshift, but the question is about the lower limit, so the minimal z is 2.29. So the minimal acceptable z is that value. So any z higher than that is acceptable.

But wait, looking at the options, the available options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

So the options don't have 2.29, but option C is 2.4, which is just above 2.29. So the correct answer would be the minimal z is approximately 2.3, so the lower limit is 2.3, so any z above that is acceptable. So the lower limit on the redshift is about 2.3, meaning that for the object to be detected, its redshift must be at least around 2.3.

So the options are C) 2.4 and D)1.9. So the minimal is just above 2.3, so the answer would be C)2.4.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. The question is about the lower limit on the redshift. So the minimal z such that the line can still be observed in optical.

So when z is exactly (4000/1216 - 1), which is z≈2.29, the line is at 4000 A, which is the lower limit of optical. So any z higher than that would shift the line to longer wavelengths (redder), which are more easily observed. So the lower limit is z=2.29. So the minimal z is around 2.3, so any object with z higher than that can be detected. So the question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift, which is the minimal z where it's possible. So the correct answer would be the minimal z is approximately 2.3.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is higher than 2.3. So the lower limit is 2.3, but the options don't have that. Wait, perhaps I should think about it differently. Maybe the cutoff for optical is higher than 400 nm, but perhaps the quasar's light could have other lines in the optical that are not absorbed.

Wait, no, the question is specifically about the Lyman alpha line being detected. So the line must be in the optical, meaning z must be such that 1216*(1+z) is greater than 4000 A.

So solving 1216*(1+z) ≥4000 → z ≥ (4000/1216)-1 ≈ 3.29-1=2.29.

So the lower limit is z≈2.29. So the minimal z is 2.29. So among the options, the only one that's higher than 2.29 is option C (2.4) and option A (3). So the lower limit is the minimal z, so the answer must be the minimal possible z which is approximately 2.3. So the closest option is C)2.4.

Wait but wait another thought: maybe the quasar emits the Lyman alpha line at 1216 A, but when it's redshifted, it's observed in the optical. So the question is about the lower limit. So if the redshift is too low, the line remains in the UV and can't be observed. So the minimal z is when the line moves into the optical.

Wait, but sometimes the Lyman alpha line is not the only line. Maybe I should think about the Lyman limit or other factors, but I think the main point is the redshift needed to bring the 1216 A line into the optical.

Hmm, perhaps I should check the math again. Let me compute 4000/1216 exactly.

4000 divided by 1216.

Well, 1216 × 3 is 3648. 4000 -3648=352. 352/1216=0.29. So 3.29. So 1+z=3.29 → z=2.29.

So yes, the minimal z is around 2.29. The options are A)3 (z=3, which would make lambda=1216*4=4864 A, which is 486 nm, green light), that's definitely in optical. So the minimal limit is 2.29, so the redshift must be at least that. So the lower limit is approximately 2.3, so the answer would be the option just above that, which is 2.4 (option C).

But wait, the options don't have 2.3, so the closest higher option is 2.4, which is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and the Lyman alpha line is at 121.6 nm, so 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm.

Wait, wait, wait a second. Sometimes, when dealing with redshift, the formula is lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (1 + z). So if the emitted wavelength is 121.6 nm, and the observed wavelength is 400 nm (4000 Angstroms), then z = (4000/1216) -1 = (3.29) -1 = 2.29.

So the correct minimal redshift is approximately 2.29. So the answer must be the option just above that, which is 2.4 (option C).

Wait, but looking back, the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

So the minimal z is ~2.29, so the lower limit is when z is about 2.29. So any object with z >=2.29 can be detected. So in the options, the lowest available that is higher than 2.29 is option C (2.4). So the answer should be C.

To estimate the lower limit on the redshift of objects such that the Lyman alpha absorption line (~1216 Å) from background quasars can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we need to determine the redshift \( z \) that shifts the Lyman alpha wavelength into the optical range. Optical telescopes can observe wavelengths starting approximately at 400 nm (4000 Å), as shorter wavelengths are blocked by atmospheric absorption.

The observed wavelength after redshift is given by:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot (1 + z)
\]

Here, the rest wavelength of the Lyman alpha line is \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = 1216 \, \text{Å} \). To ensure the observed wavelength \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \) is in the optical range, we set \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \geq 4000 \, \text{Å} \). Solving for \( z \):

\[
1 + z = \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}}}{\lambda_{\text{rest}}} = \frac{4000}{1216} \approx 3.29
\]

\[
z \approx 3.29 - 1 = 2.29
\]

Thus, the minimal redshift required for the Lyman alpha line to be detectable in the optical range is approximately \( z \approx 2.29 \). Among the given options, the closest value higher than this is \( z = 2.4 \), corresponding to option C.

Critical analysis of the options:
- **Option A (3):** This redshift would place the Lyman alpha line far into the optical range, but it is unnecessarily high since a lower redshift suffices.
- **Option B (1.2):** At this redshift, the observed wavelength would be \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 1216 \cdot (1 + 1.2) = 2678.4 \, \text{Å} \), which is in the UV and not detectable by optical telescopes.
- **Option C (2.4):** This redshift places the Lyman alpha line at \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 1216 \cdot (1 + 2.4) = 4121.6 \, \text{Å} \), well within the optical range and detectable by ground-based telescopes.
- **Option D (1.9):** At this redshift, the observed wavelength would be \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 1216 \cdot (1 + 1.9) = 3526.4 \, \text{Å} \), which is in the near-UV and not detectable by optical telescopes.

Therefore, the lower limit on the redshift is approximately \( z \approx 2.29 \), and the closest option is **C (2.4)**.
