Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². Oh right, I remember that an isotropic 3D harmonic oscillator can be treated as three independent 1D harmonic oscillators in each spatial direction (x, y, z). 

The question is asking for two things: the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to that energy eigenvalue.

Wait, I think I need to remember how the energy levels work for a 3D harmonic oscillator. Each 1D oscillator has energy levels given by (n + 1/2) ħω, where n is the quantum number (n=0,1,2,...). In three dimensions, the total energy would be the sum of the energies in each direction. So the total energy E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. 

But wait, another way to think about it is that the 3D harmonic oscillator can be described by a single quantum number that's the sum of the individual quantum numbers. So, n = n_x + n_y + n_z. Then the energy levels are given by E = (n + 3/2) ħω. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes energy levels depend on the sum of the quantum numbers. So in 3D, the energy depends on the sum of the individual quantum numbers from each direction.

Now, for the third excited state: wait, what defines the excited state? The ground state is the lowest energy level. So the first excited state would be the next level up, then second, third, etc. The energy levels are quantized, and each level corresponds to a certain n, which is the sum of n_x, n_y, n_z.

Wait, but wait. The ground state (n=0) is when all n_x, n_y, n_z are zero. Then the first excited state would be when one of them is 1, others zero. So the sum n would be 1. The second excited state would have n=2, but it could be either two in one direction (like n_x=2, others 0) or one each in two directions (n_x=1, n_y=1, n_z=0). The third excited state would be n=3. 

Wait, but wait: in 3D, the energy depends on n = n_x + n_y + n_z. So the energy levels are degenerate for different combinations of (n_x, n_y, n_z) that sum to the same n. Like for n=1, there's only one state (each of the three directions), but for higher n, the degeneracy increases.

So, the energy levels are E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is 0,1,2,3,... So the ground state is n=0, E= (3/2) ħω. The first excited state would be n=1, E= (5/2) ħω. The second excited state is n=2, E= (7/2) ħω. The third excited state is n=3, E= (9/2) ħω. Wait, no, wait. Because in 3D, the ground state is the lowest energy, which is n=0. The next energy level is n=1, which is higher. So the first excited state is n=1, second is n=2, third is n=3. So third excited state would have n=3, so E= (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. So that's the first part of the question.

Now, the second part: how many linearly independent eigenfunctions (eigenstates) are possible for the same energy eigenvalue (i.e., same n=3). So we need to find the degeneracy, the number of states with the same n=3.

The degeneracy for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator at energy level n is given by (n + 1)(n + 2)/2. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The number of ways to write n as the sum of three non-negative integers n_x + n_y + n_z = n. That's a combinatorial problem. The number of such combinations is (n + 3 -1) choose (3-1)) ) = (n+2 choose 2) ) = (n+2)(n+1)/2. So for n =3, that would be (3+2)(3+1)/2 = 5 *4 /2 = 10. So the degeneracy is 10. So there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for n=3.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option A says (9/2) ħω, 10. So that matches. Option C says 3, which is wrong. So the correct answer is A.

Wait, but let me double-check the degeneracy formula. Another way to think about it is the degeneracy d(n) = (n + 2)(n +1)/2. So for n=0, d=1. n=1, d= (3)(2)/2=3. n=2, d= (4)(3)/2=6. n=3, d=10. So yes, the third excited state (n=3) has d=10. So the correct answer is option A.

The problem involves a quantum mechanical system of a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, \( V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2 \). The energy levels for such a system are given by \( E = \left(n + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega \), where \( n = n_x + n_y + n_z \) is the sum of the quantum numbers in the three spatial directions. The degeneracy of the energy levels, i.e., the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the same energy eigenvalue, is determined by the number of ways to partition \( n \) into three non-negative integers \( n_x, n_y, n_z \). This degeneracy is given by the combinatorial formula \( d(n) = \frac{(n + 2)(n + 1)}{2} \).

The question asks for the energy of the third excited state and the degeneracy at that energy level. The ground state corresponds to \( n = 0 \), and the energy levels increase with \( n \). Thus, the first, second, and third excited states correspond to \( n = 1 \), \( n = 2 \), and \( n = 3 \), respectively. For \( n = 3 \), the energy is:

\[
E = \left(3 + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega.
\]

The degeneracy for \( n = 3 \) is calculated as:

\[
d(3) = \frac{(3 + 2)(3 + 1)}{2} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2} = 10.
\]

Thus, the energy of the third excited state is \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega \), and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to this energy eigenvalue.

From the given options:
- Option A states \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega \) and 10, which matches the calculations.
- Option C states \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega \) but incorrectly lists the degeneracy as 3.
- Options B and D involve incorrect expressions for the energy.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
