Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let's see what it says. Hmm. It's about a spin-half particle in a linear superposition of spin-up and spin-down states. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2|↓⟩. Oh wait, I remember that |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of the σz operator. 

The question is asking for the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx. Oh right, the expectation value is like the average value you'd measure if you measured that operator many times on the same state.

I think I should break down the problem. The expectation value of an operator is ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, where O is the operator. So here, O is 10σz + 5σx. So the expectation value would be 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

Let me remember the properties. For σz, since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are its eigenstates, the expectation value of σz is just the eigenvalue corresponding to the state. For σx, it's a bit trickier because |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ aren't eigenstates of σx. So I'll need to compute the expectation value of σx in this state.

First, let's compute ⟨σz⟩. Since the state is a linear combination of σz eigenstates. The state is ψ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Since |↑⟩ has eigenvalue +1 for σz and |↓⟩ has -1.

The expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their eigenvalues. So |0.5|^2 * (+1) + |sqrt(3)/2|^2 * (-1).

Calculating the squares: |0.5|^2 is 0.25. (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4) = 0.75. So 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5.

Now, for σx. I remember that σx has matrix representation [[0,1],[1,0]]. So the operator σx can be written as |↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|. 

The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is the inner product of ψ with σx acting on ψ. So let's write it out.

ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, where a=0.5, b=sqrt(3)/2.

So σx acting on ψ is a|↑⟩⟨↓| + b|↓⟩⟨↑|. Wait, maybe breaking it down better.

Wait, let's compute ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩. Let me compute each part step by step.

⟨ψ| is (0.5⟨↑| + (sqrt(3)/2)⟨↓| ).

σx acting on |↑⟩ is |↓⟩, and σx acting on |↓⟩ is |↑⟩. So:

σx |ψ⟩ = 0.5 σx |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) σx |↓⟩ 
= 0.5 |↓⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↑⟩.

So ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = [0.5⟨↑| + (sqrt(3)/2)⟨↓| ] [0.5 |↓⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↑⟩ ].

Multiplying these out:

= 0.5 * 0.5 * ⟨↑|↓⟩ + 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) * ⟨↑|↑⟩
+ (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5 * ⟨↓|↓⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * ⟨↓|↑⟩.

But ⟨↑|↓⟩ is zero because they're orthogonal. So the first and last terms vanish.

So we're left with:
0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) * 1 + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 *1.

Which is (0.5*sqrt(3)/2) + (0.5*sqrt(3)/2) = 2*(0.5*sqrt(3)/2) )= (sqrt(3)/2 ).

Wait, sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732. So sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866. So ⟨σx⟩ is approximately 0.866.

Wait, but I should double-check. Let me compute it algebraically again.

⟨σx⟩ = (a b* + a* b ), because when you expand ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩, since the cross terms are the product of a and b*, and a* and b.

Wait, wait, in general, for ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, σx has ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = (a b* + a* b) . Because the terms where you have a⟨↑| acting on b|↓⟩ gives a b*, and similarly for the other term.

So a is 0.5, b is sqrt(3)/2. So a b* is (0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) since b is real, so b* is same as b. So a b is 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/4.

Similarly, a* b is same as a b because a is real. So total expectation is 2*(sqrt(3)/4) ) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2.

Wait, but wait, I thought σx is an observable with eigenvalues +1 and -1. So the expectation could be in between, which makes sense.

Now, putting it all together. The operator is 10σz +5σx.

So expectation value is 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

We have ⟨σz⟩ = -0.5, ⟨σx⟩= sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So 10*(-0.5) is -5. And 5*(0.866) ≈4.33.

Adding them: -5 + 4.33 = -0.67. Wait, but let me compute more accurately.

Wait, 10*(-0.5) is -5.0.

5*(sqrt(3)/2) is (5 *1.732)/2 ≈ (8.66)/2 ≈4.33.

So -5.0 +4.33 = -0.67. So approximately -0.67.

Looking at the options, the choices are A)-1.4, B)1.65, C)-0.7, D)0.85.

Hmm. My calculation gives -0.67, which is close to option C) -0.7. So the answer is C.

Wait, maybe I should recheck the calculations.

First, ⟨σz⟩ is 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5. Correct.

⟨σx⟩ is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2 ) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) ) = 2*(0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 ) = (sqrt(3)/2) ≈0.8660.

So 10*(-0.5) = -5.0.

5*(0.8660) = 5*0.8660 =4.33.

Total: -5 +4.33= -0.67.

So the expectation is approximately -0.67. So rounding to one decimal place would be -0.7, which is option C.

To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is expressed as:

\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
Since \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are eigenstates of \( \sigma_z \) with eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively, the expectation value \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = |0.5|^2 \cdot (+1) + \left|\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right|^2 \cdot (-1).
\]

Calculating the probabilities:
\[
|0.5|^2 = 0.25, \quad \left|\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right|^2 = \frac{3}{4} = 0.75.
\]

Thus:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 0.25 \cdot (+1) + 0.75 \cdot (-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The expectation value \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \) is calculated as:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle.
\]

Expanding \( \psi \) as \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \), we find:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2 \cdot \text{(probability of transitioning between states)}.
\]

The cross terms in \( \langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle \) give:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2 \cdot \left(0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

Approximating \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \), we find:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle \approx \frac{1.732}{2} \approx 0.866.
\]

### Step 3: Combine Results
The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10(-0.5) + 5(0.866) = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]

### Step 4: Match to Options
The result \( -0.67 \) rounds to \( -0.7 \), which corresponds to option **C**.

The expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their eigenvalues. So |0.5|^2 * (+1) + |sqrt(3)/2|^2 * (-1).

Calculating the squares: |0.5|^2 is 0.25. (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4) = 0.75. So 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5.

Now, for σx. I remember that σx has matrix representation [[0,1],[1,0]]. So the operator σx can be written as |↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|. 

The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is the inner product of ψ with σx acting on ψ. So let's write it out.

ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, where a=0.5, b=sqrt(3)/2.

So σx acting on ψ is a|↑⟩⟨↓| + b|↓⟩⟨↑|. Wait, maybe breaking it down better.

Wait, let's compute ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩. Let me compute each part step by step.

⟨ψ| is (0.5⟨↑| + (sqrt(3)/2)⟨↓| ).

σx acting on |↑⟩ is |↓⟩, and σx acting on |↓⟩ is |↑⟩. So:

σx |ψ⟩ = 0.5 σx |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) σx |↓⟩ 
= 0.5 |↓⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↑⟩.

So ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = [0.5⟨↑| + (sqrt(3)/2)⟨↓| ] [0.5 |↓⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↑⟩ ].

Multiplying these out:

= 0.5 * 0.5 * ⟨↑|↓⟩ + 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) * ⟨↑|↑⟩
+ (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5 * ⟨↓|↓⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * ⟨↓|↑⟩.

But ⟨↑|↓⟩ is zero because they're orthogonal. So the first and last terms vanish.

So we're left with:
0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) * 1 + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 *1.

Which is (0.5*sqrt(3)/2) + (0.5*sqrt(3)/2) = 2*(0.5*sqrt(3)/2) )= (sqrt(3)/2 ).

Wait, sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732. So sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866. So ⟨σx⟩ is approximately 0.866.

Wait, but I should double-check. Let me compute it algebraically again.

⟨σx⟩ = (a b* + a* b ), because when you expand ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩, since the cross terms are the product of a and b*, and a* and b.

So a is 0.5, b is sqrt(3)/2. So a b* is (0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) since b is real, so b* is same as b. So a b is 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/4.

Similarly, a* b is same as a b because a is real. So total expectation is 2*(sqrt(3)/4) ) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2.

Wait, but wait, I thought σx is an observable with eigenvalues +1 and -1. So the expectation could be in between, which makes sense.

Now, putting it all together. The operator is 10σz +5σx.

So expectation value is 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

We have ⟨σz⟩ = -0.5, ⟨σx⟩= sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So 10*(-0.5) is -5. And 5*(0.866) ≈4.33.

Adding them: -5 + 4.33 = -0.67. Wait, but let me compute more accurately.

Wait, 10*(-0.5) is -5.0.

5*(sqrt(3)/2) is (5 *1.732)/2 ≈ (8.66)/2 ≈4.33.

So -5.0 +4.33 = -0.67. So approximately -0.67.

Looking at the options, the choices are A)-1.4, B)1.65, C)-0.7, D)0.85.

Hmm. My calculation gives -0.67, which is close to option C) -0.7. So the answer is C.

Wait, maybe I should recheck the calculations.

First, ⟨σz⟩ is 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5. Correct.

⟨σx⟩ is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2 ) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) ) = 2*(0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 ) = (sqrt(3)/2) ≈0.8660.

So 10*(-0.5) = -5.0.

5*(0.8660) = 5*0.8660 =4.33.

So the expectation is approximately -0.67. So rounding to one decimal place would be -0.7, which is option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is expressed as:

\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
Since \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are eigenstates of \( \sigma_z \) with eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively, the expectation value \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = |0.5|^2 \cdot (+1) + \left|\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right|^2 \cdot (-1).
\]

Calculating the probabilities:
\[
|0.5|^2 = 0.25, \quad \left|\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right|^2 = \frac{3}{4} = 0.75.
\]

Thus:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 0.25 \cdot (+1) + 0.75 \cdot (-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The expectation value \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \) is calculated as:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle.
\]

Expanding \( \psi \) as \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \), we find:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2 \cdot \text{(probability of transitioning between states)}.
\]

The cross terms in \( \langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle \) give:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2 \cdot \left(0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

Approximating \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \), we find:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle \approx \frac{1.732}{2} \approx 0.866.
\]

### Step 3: Combine Results
The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10(-0.5) + 5(0.866) = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]

### Step 4: Match to Options
The result \( -0.67 \) rounds to \( -0.7 \), which corresponds to option **C**.
