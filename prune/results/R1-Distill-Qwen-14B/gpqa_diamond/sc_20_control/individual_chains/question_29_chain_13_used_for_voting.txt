Okay, so I've got this genetics question in front of me. Let me read it carefully. Hmm, it's about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. The goal is to eliminate this compound by mutating the gene responsible for it. The gene has five exons and four introns, which I remember means it's split into exons (which are the coding regions) and introns (non-coding, spliced out). 

They used EMS mutagenesis, which I think is a type of chemical mutagen that causes point mutations. So they've made a bunch of mutants and sequenced the target gene in each. The problem is to find which mutation would likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. 

Looking at the sequences provided:

The intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.
Then each mutant has a change in the first exon area. So the mutations are in exon 1, which is part of the coding region. 

I need to figure out which mutation would disrupt the gene product, probably by causing a premature stop codon or a significant change that makes the protein nonfunctional. 

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to the intact gene, the 4th nucleotide is T in the original (ATGTTTCTC...), here it's C. Let me see which position that is. Intact is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to look at the differences. Let's write the original and mutants:

Original starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT G TGG ATG AAC ATA TTA T TGTCGT...
Mutant 1: ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT G TGG ATG AAC ATA TTA T TGTCGC...
Wait, maybe I should count the positions. Let me see:

Original first part: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant1: ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...
Ah, so the third codon in the original is TTT (which is Phe), and in Mutant1 it's TCT (Ser). Then the fourth codon in original is CTC (Leu), and in Mutant1 it's TAC (Tyr). Or wait, the change happens at the third codon? Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I should write the sequences to compare better.

Original: 5' ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA ... 3'
Mutant1: 5' ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTC G ... 3' (assuming the rest is same)
Wait, no, looking at the question, the mutants have a change in the first exon. Let me look at the sequences carefully.

Wait, the question writes the sequences as:

Intact:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So the first part differs: the intact is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTT...
Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTT...

So the first 12 nucleotides in the intact are ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

In mutant1: ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Wait, maybe it's better to break it into codons.

Original first few codons (exon 1):
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

Mutant1:
ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Wait, perhaps I should list each change:

Original: positions 1-60 (approx)
Mutant1: let's see, the first change occurs at the third nucleotide. Let me compare each position.

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA...
Mutant1: ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Hmm, looking at the first 15 nucleotides. Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT.

Mutant1: ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT.

So the changes are in the second and third codons.

Original: TTT CTC (codon 2 and 3: Phe, Leu)
Mutant1: TCT TAC (Ser, Tyr)

So the amino acids would change from Phe (TTT) to Ser (TCT) in the second codon, and CTC (Leu) becomes TAC (Tyr) in the third codon.

So that's two amino acid changes but not a stop codon. So the protein might be altered but still functional or maybe not. Not sure if that would eliminate the compound.

Mutant2:
5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to original, let's see:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant2: ATG TCT TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

So, breaking into codons:

Original: codon 1: ATG (Met), codon 2: TTT (Phe), codon 3: CTC (Leu), codon4: GCT (Ala), codon5: GGT (Gly), codon6: ACT (Thr), codon7: TCT (Ser), codon8: GTG (Val), etc.

Mutant2: codon1: ATG, codon2: TCT (Ser), codon3: TAA (stop), codon4: GCT, etc.

Wait, the third codon in Mutant2 is TAA, which is a stop codon (TAA is a stop). So in the protein, this would cause a premature stop after the second amino acid.

Wait, wait, let's see the exact positions. The original is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant2: ATG TCT TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

So, the second codon is TCT (Ser), the third is TAA (stop). So the protein would be Met, Ser, then stop. That's only two amino acids, making a very short peptide. So this would likely disrupt the gene's function, as the protein is truncated.

But wait, what's the impact? If the gene product is an enzyme that synthesizes the compound, a truncated protein might not be functional. So this could eliminate the compound. But is this the correct approach? Because the question is to eliminate the compound, so a nonfunctional enzyme would do that.

Wait, but let me check the other mutants as well.

Mutant3:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
So comparing to original:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...
Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG...

Wait, no, perhaps let's look:

Original starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG...

Wait, maybe I should look at the actual nucleotides.

Original: ...TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Mutant3: ...TTTCTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Wait, wait, in Mutant3, the sequence is TTCTACGCTGGTGT... So the original is TTCTCGCTGGTACT... 

So in Mutant3, let's see: the original is CTC GCT GGT ACT. In mutant3, it's TAC GCT GGT GTC.

So codons 3: CTC (Leu) becomes TAC (Tyr), codon4: GCT (Ala) stays, codon5: GGT (Gly) stays, but codon6: ACT (Thr) in original becomes GTC (Val) in mutant3.

So changes in the 3rd and 6th codons. So the amino acids change, but not a stop codon. So the protein would have some changes but might still function, unless it's a critical region.

Mutant4:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
So original: ...TTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTG...

Mutant4: ...TTCTACACTTCTGTG...

Wait, let me see:

Original: ...TTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTG...

Mutant4: ...TTCTACACTTCTGTG...

So the original is TTCT CGC TGG TAC TT...

Wait, perhaps better to split into codons:

Original exons: ...TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant4: ...TTT TAC ACT TCT GTG...

Wait, the original after ATG is TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val).

Mutant4: the sequence is TTT TAC ACT TCT GTG...

So codon2: CTC (Leu) becomes TAC (Tyr), codon3: GCT (Ala) becomes ACT (Thr), codon4: GGT becomes TCT (Ser) perhaps? Or wait, perhaps the change is more extensive.

Wait, perhaps the entire region is altered. Let me compare:

Original starts with ...TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant4: ...TTT TAC ACT TCT GTG...

So codon2 (CTC Leu) becomes TAC (Tyr), codon3 (GCT Ala) becomes ACT (Thr), and codon4 (GGT Gly) becomes TCT (Ser). So, multiple changes. But no stop codon. So the protein would have changes in amino acids 2,3,4. Maybe this disrupts the function, but not a frameshift.

Wait, but how about the reading frame? Because if it's a point mutation, the reading frame remains same. So all codons are read correctly.

So which mutation is most likely to eliminate the compound? The idea is that if the gene product is an enzyme, mutating it to make a nonfunctional enzyme would stop the compound's synthesis.

Looking at the options:

Mutant1: Two amino acids changed. No stop.

Mutant2: Second codon changed to Ser, third to stop. So the protein is much shorter. Probably nonfunctional.

Mutant3: Two changes, but no stop.

Mutant4: Multiple changes, but no stop.

So the most drastic change is in Mutant2, which introduces a stop codon early in the protein. That would likely render the protein nonfunctional, thus stopping the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check.

Intact gene: ...ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Mutant2: ...ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…

So comparing:

Original: position 4-6: TTT
Mutant2: position 4-6: TCT
Then, original position7-9: CTC (codon3: Leu)
Mutant2: TAA (codon3: stop)

So the first three codons in original are Met, Phe, Leu, Ala, Gly, Thr, Ser, Val...

In Mutant2, first: Met, second: Ser, third: stop. So the protein would be Met-Ser, then stop. That's a very short peptide. So the gene would not produce the full-length enzyme, probably leading to no activity.

So the correct option is Mutant 2, which is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the barley cultivar, we analyze the mutations in the first exon of the gene responsible for synthesizing the compound. The intact gene sequence is provided, along with the sequences of four mutant lines (Mutant 1, Mutant 2, Mutant 3, and Mutant 4). The goal is to identify the mutation that disrupts the gene's function, likely by introducing a premature stop codon or significantly altering the protein structure.

### Analysis of Each Mutant:

1. **Mutant 1**:
   - The sequence shows changes in the second and third codons:  
     - Codon 2: TTT (Phe) → TCT (Ser)  
     - Codon 3: CTC (Leu) → TAC (Tyr)  
   - These changes result in amino acid substitutions but do not introduce a stop codon. The protein is likely altered but may still retain partial function.

2. **Mutant 2**:
   - The sequence shows significant changes:  
     - Codon 2: TTT (Phe) → TCT (Ser)  
     - Codon 3: CTC (Leu) → TAA (stop codon)  
   - The introduction of a stop codon at codon 3 truncates the protein after the second amino acid. This results in a very short, nonfunctional protein, effectively eliminating the gene's function.

3. **Mutant 3**:
   - The sequence shows changes in codons 3 and 6:  
     - Codon 3: CTC (Leu) → TAC (Tyr)  
     - Codon 6: ACT (Thr) → GTC (Val)  
   - These changes result in amino acid substitutions but do not introduce a stop codon. The protein structure is altered, but it may still retain some functionality depending on the critical nature of the changed residues.

4. **Mutant 4**:
   - The sequence shows changes in codons 2, 3, and 4:  
     - Codon 2: CTC (Leu) → TAC (Tyr)  
     - Codon 3: GCT (Ala) → ACT (Thr)  
     - Codon 4: GGT (Gly) → TCT (Ser)  
   - These changes result in multiple amino acid substitutions but do not introduce a stop codon. The protein structure is significantly altered, but the absence of a stop codon means the protein may still be produced, albeit with reduced or altered functionality.

### Conclusion:
Among the mutants, **Mutant 2** is the most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. The introduction of a stop codon at codon 3 results in a truncated, nonfunctional protein, effectively disrupting the gene's function. This makes Mutant 2 the best candidate for eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.

Okay, so I've got this genetics question in front of me. Let me read it carefully. Hmm, it's about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. The goal is to eliminate this compound by mutating the gene responsible for it. The gene has five exons and four introns, which I remember means it's split into exons (which are the coding regions) and introns (non-coding, spliced out). 

They used EMS mutagenesis, which I think is a type of chemical mutagen that causes point mutations. So they've made a bunch of mutants and sequenced the target gene in each. The problem is to find which mutation would likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. 

Looking at the sequences provided:

The intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.
Then each mutant has a change in the first exon area. So the mutations are in exon 1, which is part of the coding region. 

I need to figure out which mutation would disrupt the gene product, probably by causing a premature stop codon or a significant change that makes the protein nonfunctional. 

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to the intact gene, the 4th nucleotide is T in the original (ATGTTTCTC...), here it's C. Let me see which position that is. Intact is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to look at the differences. Let's write the original and mutants:

Original starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT G TGG ATG AAC ATA TTA T TGTCGT...
Mutant 1: ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT G TGG ATG AAC ATA TTA T TGTCGC...
Wait, maybe I should count the positions. Let me see:

Original first part: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant1: ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...
Ah, so the third codon in the original is TTT (which is Phe), and in Mutant1 it's TCT (Ser). Then the fourth codon in original is CTC (Leu), and in Mutant1 it's TAC (Tyr). Or wait, the change happens at the third codon? Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I should write the sequences to compare better.

Original: 5' ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA ... 3'
Mutant1: 5' ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTC G ... 3' (assuming the rest is same)
Wait, no, looking at the question, the mutants have a change in the first exon. Let me look at the sequences carefully.

Wait, the question writes the sequences as:

Intact:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So the first part differs: the intact is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTT...
Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTT...

So the first 12 nucleotides in the intact are ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

In mutant1: ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Wait, maybe it's better to break it into codons.

Original first few codons (exon 1):
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

Mutant1:
ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Wait, perhaps I should list each change:

Original: positions 1-60 (approx)
Mutant1: let's see, the first change occurs at the third nucleotide. Let me compare each position.

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA...
Mutant1: ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Hmm, looking at the first 15 nucleotides. Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT.

Mutant1: ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT.

So the changes are in the second and third codons.

Original: TTT CTC (codon 2 and 3: Phe, Leu)
Mutant1: TCT TAC (Ser, Tyr)

So the amino acids would change from Phe (TTT) to Ser (TCT) in the second codon, and CTC (Leu) becomes TAC (Tyr) in the third codon.

So that's two amino acid changes but not a stop codon. So the protein might be altered but still functional or maybe not. Not sure if that would eliminate the compound.

Mutant2:
5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to original, let's see:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant2: ATG TCT TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

So, breaking into codons:

Original: codon 1: ATG (Met), codon 2: TTT (Phe), codon 3: CTC (Leu), codon4: GCT (Ala), codon5: GGT (Gly), codon6: ACT (Thr), codon7: TCT (Ser), codon8: GTG (Val), etc.

Mutant2: codon1: ATG, codon2: TCT (Ser), codon3: TAA (stop), codon4: GCT, etc.

Wait, the third codon in Mutant2 is TAA, which is a stop codon (TAA is a stop). So in the protein, this would cause a premature stop after the second amino acid.

Wait, wait, let's see the exact positions. The original is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant2: ATG TCT TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

So, the second codon is TCT (Ser), the third is TAA (stop). So the protein would be Met, Ser, then stop. That's only two amino acids, making a very short peptide. So this would likely disrupt the gene's function, as the protein is truncated.

But wait, what's the impact? If the gene product is an enzyme that synthesizes the compound, a truncated protein might not be functional. So this could eliminate the compound. But is this the correct approach? Because the question is to eliminate the compound, so a nonfunctional enzyme would do that.

Wait, but let me check the other mutants as well.

Mutant3:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
So comparing to original:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...
Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG...

Wait, no, perhaps let's look:

Original starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG...

Wait, maybe I should look at the actual nucleotides.

Original: ...TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Mutant3: ...TTTCTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Wait, wait, in Mutant3, the sequence is TTCTACGCTGGTGT... So the original is TTCTCGCTGGTACT... 

So in Mutant3, let's see: the original is CTC GCT GGT ACT. In mutant3, it's TAC GCT GGT GTC.

So codons 3: CTC (Leu) becomes TAC (Tyr), codon4: GCT (Ala) stays, codon5: GGT (Gly) stays, but codon6: ACT (Thr) in original becomes GTC (Val) in mutant3.

So changes in the 3rd and 6th codons. So the amino acids change, but not a stop codon. So the protein would have some changes but might still function, unless it's a critical region.

Mutant4:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
So original: ...TTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTG...

Mutant4: ...TTCTACACTTCTGTG...

Wait, let me see:

Original: ...TTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTG...

Mutant4: ...TTCTACACTTCTGTG...

So the original is TTCT CGC TGG TAC TT...

Wait, perhaps better to split into codons:

Original exons: ...TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant4: ...TTT TAC ACT TCT GTG...

Wait, the original after ATG is TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val).

Mutant4: the sequence is TTT TAC ACT TCT GTG...

So codon2: CTC (Leu) becomes TAC (Tyr), codon3: GCT (Ala) becomes ACT (Thr), codon4: GGT becomes TCT (Ser) perhaps? Or wait, perhaps the change is more extensive.

Wait, perhaps the entire region is altered. Let me compare:

Original starts with ...TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant4: ...TTT TAC ACT TCT GTG...

So codon2 (CTC Leu) becomes TAC (Tyr), codon3 (GCT Ala) becomes ACT (Thr), and codon4 (GGT Gly) becomes TCT (Ser). So, multiple changes. But no stop codon. So the protein would have changes in amino acids 2,3,4. Maybe this disrupts the function, but not a frameshift.

Wait, but how about the reading frame? Because if it's a point mutation, the reading frame remains same. So all codons are read correctly.

So which mutation is most likely to eliminate the compound? The idea is that if the gene product is an enzyme, mutating it to make a nonfunctional enzyme would stop the compound's synthesis.

Looking at the options:

Mutant1: Two amino acids changed. No stop.

Mutant2: Second codon changed to Ser, third to stop. So the protein is much shorter. Probably nonfunctional.

Mutant3: Two changes, but no stop.

Mutant4: Multiple changes, but no stop.

So the most drastic change is in Mutant2, which introduces a stop codon early in the protein. That would likely render the protein nonfunctional, thus stopping the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check.

Intact gene: ...ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Mutant2: ...ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…

So comparing:

Original: position 4-6: TTT
Mutant2: position 4-6: TCT
Then, original position7-9: CTC (codon3: Leu)
Mutant2: TAA (codon3: stop)

So the first three codons in original are Met, Phe, Leu, Ala, Gly, Thr, Ser, Val...

In Mutant2, first: Met, second: Ser, third: stop. So the protein would be Met-Ser, then stop. That's a very short peptide. So the gene would not produce the full-length enzyme, probably leading to no activity.

So the correct option is Mutant 2, which is option A.

The goal is to identify the mutation that disrupts the gene's function, likely by introducing a premature stop codon or significantly altering the protein structure.

### Analysis of Each Mutant:

1. **Mutant 1**:
   - The sequence shows changes in the second and third codons:  
     - Codon 2: TTT (Phe) → TCT (Ser)  
     - Codon 3: CTC (Leu) → TAC (Tyr)  
   - These changes result in amino acid substitutions but do not introduce a stop codon. The protein is likely altered but may still retain partial function.

2. **Mutant 2**:
   - The sequence shows significant changes:  
     - Codon 2: TTT (Phe) → TCT (Ser)

     - Codon 6: ACT (Thr) → GTC (Val)  
   - These changes result in amino acid substitutions but do not introduce a stop codon. The protein structure is altered, but it may still retain some functionality depending on the critical nature of the changed residues.

4. **Mutant 4**:
   - The sequence shows changes in codons 2, 3, and 4:  
     - Codon 2: CTC (Leu) → TAC (Tyr)  
     - Codon 3: GCT (Ala) → ACT (Thr)  
     - Codon 4: GGT (Gly) → TCT (Ser)  
   - These changes result in multiple amino acid substitutions but do not introduce a stop codon. The protein structure is significantly altered, but the absence of a stop codon means the protein may still be produced, albeit with reduced or altered functionality.

### Conclusion:
Among the mutants, **Mutant 2** is the most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. The introduction of a stop codon at codon 3 results in a truncated, nonfunctional protein, effectively disrupting the gene's function. This makes Mutant 2 the best candidate for eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.
