Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about electrons in p orbitals. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is a bit tricky, but I'll take it slow.

Alright, the problem says we have two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. We're told to ignore their spin angular momentum. The coupled state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So each electron has l1 = 1 and l2 =1. The total angular momentum quantum number is l=2, and m is -1.

The question asks about the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z to be -ħ. Wait, Lz for each particle. Since Lz is the z-component of orbital angular momentum, each Li_z has eigenvalues of li * ħ, where li is the quantum number for each. So for an electron in a p orbital, li is 1, so L1z can be +ħ, 0, or -ħ. Similarly for L2z.

So the measurement question is, what's the probability that both L1z and L2z are -ħ. That would mean each electron contributes -ħ. So the product is (-ħ) * (-ħ) = ħ², but the question is about the probability of both being measured as -ħ.

Wait, but the state is given in terms of the coupled angular momentum. So the state is |1,1,2,-1>. To find the probability, I think I need to express this state in terms of all possible |l1z, l2z> states. Because the measurement is in the product basis of L1z and L2z.

Right, but how do I get from the coupled state to the product state? I remember that the coupled basis (like |l1, l2, l, m>) can be expressed as a linear combination of the product basis (|l1z> |l2z>).

So, the state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of states where the sum of the m's is -1. Because m = m1 + m2. Since each electron has l=1, their individual m can be -1, 0, +1.

Wait, but the state is |l1=1, l2=1, l=2, m=-1>. So in terms of the product state, the possible m1 and m2 combinations that add up to m=-1 are:

m1 = -1 and m2=0 → sum -1.

m1=0 and m2=-1 → sum -1.

m1=1 and m2=-2 → but wait, m2 can't be -2 because l2 is 1, so m2 can only be -1, 0, +1. So that's not possible. So only two possibilities: (-1, 0) and (0, -1).

Wait, but then, for the coupled state |l=2, m=-1⟩, it's a combination of these two product states. So the state is a linear combination of |m1=-1, m2=0⟩ and |m1=0, m2=-1⟩.

But wait, I'm not sure about the coefficients. To find the expansion, I need to recall the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or the formula for combining angular momenta.

The general expansion is something like:

|l1, l2, l, m⟩ = sum_{m1 + m2 = m} [ < l1 m1 l2 m2 | l m > ] | l1 m1 ⟩ | l2 m2 ⟩

In this case, l1 =1, l2=1, l=2, m=-1.

So the possible m1 and m2 values are such that m1 + m2 = -1. As I thought before, possible (m1, m2) are (-1,0) and (0, -1).

So the state is a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0⟩ and |m1=0, m2=-1⟩.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for each term is <1 m1 1 m2 | 2 -1>.

Looking up the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l=2 and m=-1, we can find the coefficients for each of these terms.

Wait, let me think. For l1 = l2 =1, and l=2. The CG coefficients for m=-1. Let me think about the possible states.

The state |2, -1⟩ can be written as:

√(1/3) |1, -1⟩ |1, 0⟩ + √(2/3) |1, 0⟩ |1, -1⟩.

Wait, am I getting that right? Wait, no, wait. Because when adding two angular momenta, the coefficients depend on the specific terms.

Wait, maybe I should think about the general formula for the CG coefficients. For two spin-1 particles combining to spin 2.

Wait, the CG coefficients for |l, m⟩ = sum_{m1, m2} [ <l1 m1 l2 m2 | l m> ] |l1 m1⟩ |l2 m2⟩.

So for l=2, m=-1, the possible m1 and m2 are:

m1 = -1, m2=0; m1=0, m2=-1.

So the state is a sum of |1, -1⟩ |1, 0⟩ and |1, 0⟩ |1, -1⟩.

The CG coefficient for each term is sqrt(1/3) and sqrt(2/3), but I'm not entirely sure about the signs and the order.

Wait, another approach: the state |l=2, m=-1⟩ is symmetric in the coupling of two l=1 particles, but wait, no, because the orbitals here are identical particles? Wait, but electrons are identical fermions, but in this case, since we're ignoring spin, the problem is purely about angular momentum, so perhaps the state should be antisymmetric under exchange? Or maybe not, since spin is ignored here, and the problem is just about angular momentum.

Wait, but in this problem, we're considering the orbital angular momentum only. So each electron is in a p orbital, and their spin is ignored. But when combining angular momenta, we just treat them as two distinguishable particles. So the state doesn't have to be symmetric or antisymmetric under exchange.

Wait, but the question is about the orbital angular momentum, so perhaps the particles are distinguishable in this case, maybe as electron 1 and electron 2 in separate locations, etc. So the state is just a regular combination without any symmetry.

So, back to the CG coefficients for |l=2, m=-1⟩.

The formula for CG coefficients for coupling two l=1's into l=2.

I remember that for two l=1 particles (p orbitals), the CG coefficients can be found in tables or from the recursion relations.

The state |l=2, m=2⟩ would be |1,1⟩ |1,1⟩.

For |l=2, m=1⟩: it's a combination of |1,1⟩ |1,0⟩ and |1,0⟩ |1,1⟩, but with coefficients, perhaps.

Wait, but for m=-1, I think the state is a combination of |1,-1⟩ |1,0⟩ and |1,0⟩ |1,-1⟩.

The coefficients can be found using the formula:

< l1 m1 l2 m2 | l m > = ?

In this case, l1 = l2 =1, l=2, m=-1.

The condition is m1 + m2 = m = -1.

So possible m1 = -1, m2=0; m1=0, m2=-1.

The CG coefficient for each of these combinations is given by:

sqrt( [ ( ( l - m1 )( l + m1 + 1 ) ) / ( 2 l ( 2 l + 1 ) ) ] )

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to look up the specific values.

Wait, another approach: the state |2, -1⟩ can be written as:

sqrt( (1/3) ) |1, -1⟩ |1, 0⟩ + sqrt( (2/3) ) |1, 0⟩ |1, -1⟩.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Let me think about the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for two l=1 particles.

Looking up from memory, for two l=1 particles, the CG coefficients for m=-1 are as follows:

The state |2, -1⟩ is a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0⟩ and |m1=0, m2=-1⟩.

The coefficients are sqrt(1/3) and sqrt(2/3), but I'm not sure which is which.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is:

|2, -1⟩ = sqrt(1/3) |1, -1⟩ |1, 0⟩ + sqrt(2/3) |1, 0⟩ |1, -1⟩.

Wait, but why would that be the case? Let me think about the ladder operators.

Wait, the ladder operator for L+ (raising) would take |l, m⟩ to |l, m+1⟩.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Wigner-Eckart theorem or some symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about symmetry of the state when swapping the two particles. Wait, but in this case, the two particles are in the same state (both l=1), but their m values are different.

Wait, no, the state |l=2, m=-1⟩ is symmetric under exchange? Not necessarily, because the individual m's are different. Alternatively, perhaps the state is symmetric or antisymmetric.

Wait, but if the two particles are identical, the state would have to be symmetric under exchange for bosons or antisymmetric for fermions. But in this case, we're only considering orbital angular momentum, not spin. So perhaps the state is symmetric.

But wait, in this problem, since we're considering the orbital angular momentum states as separate (without spin), and the electrons are identical particles, but I'm not sure if that affects the state. Hmm, but the problem statement says to ignore spin, so maybe it's treating them as distinguishable particles, so the state isn't required to be symmetric or antisymmetric. Hmm, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the problem treats the electrons as distinguishable, so the state is a normal combination without considering exchange symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is symmetric because m1 and m2 are just labels.

Wait, but perhaps I should proceed without worrying about that for now, and just find the expansion coefficients.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that for two p orbitals (l=1), the possible total angular momentum l can be 0,1,2.

Wait, for two l=1's, the addition gives l=2,1,0.

The state |2,-1⟩ is a member of the l=2 multiplet. So the expansion coefficients for each m1 and m2 can be found from the CG coefficients.

Wait, another approach: the state |l=2, m=-1⟩ can be written in terms of |m1, m2⟩ as:

sum_{m1 + m2 = -1} CG(1,1; 2, -1) |m1, m2⟩.

The CG coefficients for this can be found from standard tables.

Looking up the CG coefficients for adding two l=1's into l=2, the coefficients for m=-1 are:

For m1=-1, m2=0: coefficient is sqrt(1/3)

For m1=0, m2=-1: coefficient is sqrt(2/3)

So the state is:

|2, -1⟩ = sqrt(1/3) |m1=-1, m2=0⟩ + sqrt(2/3) |m1=0, m2=-1⟩.

Wait, but wait, I think the coefficients are actually the other way around. Because when m is lower, the coefficients might be different.

Alternatively, perhaps the coefficients for m=-1 are:

sqrt(2/3) |m1=-1, m2=0⟩ + sqrt(1/3) |m1=0, m2=-1⟩.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here. Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible states for l=2.

The state |l=2, m=2⟩ is just |1,1⟩ |1,1⟩. Similarly, |l=2, m=1⟩ is a combination of |1,1⟩ |1,0⟩ and |1,0⟩ |1,1⟩, each with the same coefficient, perhaps sqrt(1/2) each.

Wait, no, actually, the state |l=2, m=1⟩ would be:

sqrt( ( (2 -1 +1) / (2(2+1)) )) |1,1⟩ |1,0⟩ + sqrt( ( (2 - 0 +1) / (2(2+1)) )) |1,0⟩ |1,1⟩.

Wait, that might not be the correct approach. Alternatively, perhaps using recursion relations would help.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the coefficients for m=-1.

Wait, another approach: the state |l=2, m=-2⟩ would be |m1=-1, m2=-1⟩. Because m1 + m2 = -2.

But for m=-1, the possible m1 and m2 pairs are (-1, 0) and (0, -1).

Now, for each of these pairs, the CG coefficients can be found.

I found a source online (from memory) that the CG coefficients for two l=1's to l=2 are as follows:

For m=2: 1 * |1,1⟩ |1,1⟩.

For m=1: (1/√2) |1,1⟩ |1,0⟩ + (1/√2) |1,0⟩ |1,1⟩.

For m=0: (1/3)^0.5 |1,1⟩ |1,-1⟩ + (1/3)^0.5 |1,0⟩ |1,0⟩ + (1/3)^0.5 |1,-1⟩ |1,1⟩.

For m=-1: (1/√3) |1,-1⟩ |1,0⟩ + (sqrt(2/3)) |1,0⟩ |1,-1⟩.

Wait, that's the point. So for m=-1, the coefficients are sqrt(1/3) and sqrt(2/3).

Wait, but which term comes first?

In the state |2, -1⟩, it's:

√(1/3) |m1=-1, m2=0⟩ + √(2/3) |m1=0, m2=-1⟩.

So the state is written as:

|2,-1⟩ = sqrt(1/3) |m1=-1, m2=0⟩ + sqrt(2/3) |m1=0, m2=-1⟩.

But wait, the problem is about measuring both L1z and L2z. So each term in this expansion is a product state where L1z is m1 * ħ and L2z is m2 * ħ.

The question is, what is the probability that both L1z and L2z are -ħ.

That would require m1 = -1 and m2 = -1.

Wait, because L1z = m1 * ħ, so m1 has to be -1 for L1z to be -ħ. Similarly for m2.

But looking at the state |2,-1>, it's a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0⟩ and |m1=0, m2=-1⟩.

In neither of these terms does both m1 and m2 equal -1. So in the state |2,-1⟩, the combined state where both m1 and m2 are -1 does not appear. Because m1 + m2 = -1, so if m1=-1, m2=0; if m1=0, m2=-1.

So the state |2,-1> has zero amplitude for the |m1=-1, m2=-1> state, because m1 + m2 would be -2, which doesn't contribute to m=-1.

Therefore, the probability of both m1 and m2 being -1 is zero.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. Because in our expansion, the combined state has m1=-1, m2=0 and m1=0, m2=-1. So in neither case do both m's equal -1.

So the probability of measuring m1=-1 and m2=-1 is zero.

Thus, the joint probability of getting both L1z and L2z as -ħ is zero.

So the answer should be D) 0.

To solve the problem, we analyze the given coupled angular momentum state \(|l_1, l_2, l, m\rangle = |1,1,2,-1\rangle\). Here, \(l_1 = 1\) and \(l_2 = 1\) are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons, \(l = 2\) is the total angular momentum quantum number, and \(m = -1\) is the z-component of the total angular momentum. The goal is to determine the joint probability of measuring both \(L_{1z}\) and \(L_{2z}\) as \(-\hbar\), which corresponds to \(m_1 = -1\) and \(m_2 = -1\).

### Step 1: Expansion of the Coupled State
The coupled state \(|1,1,2,-1\rangle\) can be expressed as a linear combination of the product states \(|m_1, m_2\rangle\), where \(m_1\) and \(m_2\) are the z-components of the orbital angular momentum for the two electrons. The condition \(m_1 + m_2 = m = -1\) gives the possible pairs \((m_1, m_2)\) as:
- \((-1, 0)\)
- \((0, -1)\)

Thus, the state can be written as:
\[
|1,1,2,-1\rangle = \sqrt{\frac{1}{3}} |m_1 = -1, m_2 = 0\rangle + \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} |m_1 = 0, m_2 = -1\rangle
\]

### Step 2: Probability of Measuring \(m_1 = -1\) and \(m_2 = -1\)
The problem asks for the joint probability of measuring both \(L_{1z}\) and \(L_{2z}\) as \(-\hbar\), which corresponds to \(m_1 = -1\) and \(m_2 = -1\). However, in the expansion of \(|1,1,2,-1\rangle\), the product state \(|m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\rangle\) does not appear. This is because \(m_1 + m_2 = -2\) in this case, which does not satisfy the condition \(m_1 + m_2 = -1\).

### Step 3: Conclusion
Since the state \(|m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\rangle\) is not present in the expansion of \(|1,1,2,-1\rangle\), the amplitude (and hence the probability) of measuring \(m_1 = -1\) and \(m_2 = -1\) is zero.

### Final Answer
The joint probability of getting both \(L_{1z}\) and \(L_{2z}\) as \(-\hbar\) is:

Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about electrons in p orbitals. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is a bit tricky, but I'll take it slow.

Alright, the problem says we have two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. We're told to ignore their spin angular momentum. The coupled state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So each electron has l1 = 1 and l2 =1. The total angular momentum quantum number is l=2, and m is -1.

The question asks about the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z to be -ħ. Wait, Lz for each particle. Since Lz is the z-component of orbital angular momentum, each Li_z has eigenvalues of li * ħ, where li is the quantum number for each. So for an electron in a p orbital, li is 1, so L1z can be +ħ, 0, or -ħ. Similarly for L2z.

So the measurement question is, what's the probability that both L1z and L2z are -ħ. That would mean each electron contributes -ħ. So the product is (-ħ) * (-ħ) = ħ², but the question is about the probability of both being measured as -ħ.

Wait, but the state is given in terms of the coupled angular momentum. So the state is |1,1,2,-1>. To find the probability, I think I need to express this state in terms of all possible |l1z, l2z> states. Because the measurement is in the product basis of L1z and L2z.

Right, but how do I get from the coupled state to the product state? I remember that the coupled basis (like |l1, l2, l, m>) can be expressed as a linear combination of the product basis (|l1z> |l2z>).

So, the state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of states where the sum of the m's is -1. Because m = m1 + m2. Since each electron has l=1, their individual m can be -1, 0, +1.

Wait, but the state is |l1=1, l2=1, l=2, m=-1>. So in terms of the product state, the possible m1 and m2 combinations that add up to m=-1 are:

m1 = -1 and m2=0 → sum -1.

m1=0 and m2=-1 → sum -1.

m1=1 and m2=-2 → but wait, m2 can't be -2 because l2 is 1, so m2 can only be -1, 0, +1. So that's not possible. So only two possibilities: (-1, 0) and (0, -1).

Wait, but then, for the coupled state |l=2, m=-1⟩, it's a combination of these two product states. So the state is a linear combination of |m1=-1, m2=0⟩ and |m1=0, m2=-1⟩.

But wait, I'm not sure about the coefficients. To find the expansion, I need to recall the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or the formula for combining angular momenta.

The general expansion is something like:

|l1, l2, l, m⟩ = sum_{m1 + m2 = m} [ < l1 m1 l2 m2 | l m > ] | l1 m1 ⟩ | l2 m2 ⟩

In this case, l1 =1, l2=1, l=2, m=-1.

So the possible m1 and m2 values are such that m1 + m2 = -1. As I thought before, possible (m1, m2) are (-1,0) and (0, -1).

So the state is a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0⟩ and |m1=0, m2=-1⟩.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for each term is <1 m1 1 m2 | 2 -1>.

Looking up the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l=2 and m=-1, we can find the coefficients for each of these terms.

Wait, let me think. For l1 = l2 =1, and l=2. The CG coefficients for m=-1. Let me think about the possible states.

The state |2, -1⟩ can be written as:

√(1/3) |1, -1⟩ |1, 0⟩ + √(2/3) |1, 0⟩ |1, -1⟩.

Wait, am I getting that right? Wait, no, wait. Because when adding two angular momenta, the coefficients depend on the specific terms.

Wait, maybe I should think about the general formula for the CG coefficients. For two spin-1 particles combining to spin 2.

Wait, the CG coefficients for |l, m⟩ = sum_{m1, m2} [ <l1 m1 l2 m2 | l m> ] |l1 m1⟩ |l2 m2⟩.

So for l=2, m=-1, the possible m1 and m2 are:

m1 = -1, m2=0; m1=0, m2=-1.

So the state is a sum of |1, -1⟩ |1, 0⟩ and |1, 0⟩ |1, -1⟩.

The CG coefficient for each term is sqrt(1/3) and sqrt(2/3), but I'm not entirely sure about the signs and the order.

Wait, another approach: the state |l=2, m=-1⟩ is symmetric in the coupling of two l=1 particles, but wait, no, because the orbitals here are identical particles? Wait, but electrons are identical fermions, but in this case, since we're ignoring spin, the problem is purely about angular momentum, so perhaps the state should be antisymmetric under exchange? Or maybe not, since spin is ignored here, and the problem is just about angular momentum.

Wait, but in this problem, we're considering the orbital angular momentum only. So each electron is in a p orbital, and their spin is ignored. But when combining angular momenta, we just treat them as two distinguishable particles. So the state doesn't have to be symmetric or antisymmetric under exchange.

Wait, but the question is about the orbital angular momentum, so perhaps the particles are distinguishable in this case, maybe as electron 1 and electron 2 in separate locations, etc. So the state is just a regular combination without any symmetry.

So, back to the CG coefficients for |l=2, m=-1⟩.

The formula for CG coefficients for coupling two l=1's into l=2.

I remember that for two l=1 particles (p orbitals), the CG coefficients can be found in tables or from the recursion relations.

The state |l=2, m=2⟩ would be |1,1⟩ |1,1⟩.

For |l=2, m=1⟩: it's a combination of |1,1⟩ |1,0⟩ and |1,0⟩ |1,1⟩, but with coefficients, perhaps.

Wait, but for m=-1, I think the state is a combination of |1,-1⟩ |1,0⟩ and |1,0⟩ |1,-1⟩.

The coefficients can be found using the formula:

< l1 m1 l2 m2 | l m > = ?

In this case, l1 = l2 =1, l=2, m=-1.

The condition is m1 + m2 = m = -1.

So possible m1 = -1, m2=0; m1=0, m2=-1.

The CG coefficient for each of these combinations is given by:

sqrt( [ ( ( l - m1 )( l + m1 + 1 ) ) / ( 2 l ( 2 l + 1 ) ) ] )

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to look up the specific values.

Wait, another approach: the state |2, -1⟩ can be written as:

sqrt( (1/3) ) |1, -1⟩ |1, 0⟩ + sqrt( (2/3) ) |1, 0⟩ |1, -1⟩.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Let me think about the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for two l=1 particles.

Looking up from memory, for two l=1 particles, the CG coefficients for m=-1 are as follows:

The state |2, -1⟩ is a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0⟩ and |m1=0, m2=-1⟩.

The coefficients are sqrt(1/3) and sqrt(2/3), but I'm not sure which is which.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is:

|2, -1⟩ = sqrt(1/3) |1, -1⟩ |1, 0⟩ + sqrt(2/3) |1, 0⟩ |1, -1⟩.

Wait, but why would that be the case? Let me think about the ladder operators.

Wait, the ladder operator for L+ (raising) would take |l, m⟩ to |l, m+1⟩.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Wigner-Eckart theorem or some symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about symmetry of the state when swapping the two particles. Wait, but in this case, the two particles are in the same state (both l=1), but their m values are different.

Wait, no, the state |l=2, m=-1⟩ is symmetric under exchange? Not necessarily, because the individual m's are different. Alternatively, perhaps the state is symmetric or antisymmetric.

Wait, but if the two particles are identical, the state would have to be symmetric under exchange for bosons or antisymmetric for fermions. But in this case, we're only considering orbital angular momentum, not spin. So perhaps the state is symmetric.

But wait, in this problem, since we're considering the orbital angular momentum states as separate (without spin), and the electrons are identical particles, but I'm not sure if that affects the state. Hmm, but the problem statement says to ignore spin, so maybe it's treating them as distinguishable particles, so the state isn't required to be symmetric or antisymmetric. Hmm, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the problem treats the electrons as distinguishable, so the state is a normal combination without considering exchange symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is symmetric because m1 and m2 are just labels.

Wait, but perhaps I should proceed without worrying about that for now, and just find the expansion coefficients.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that for two p orbitals (l=1), the possible total angular momentum l can be 0,1,2.

Wait, for two l=1's, the addition gives l=2,1,0.

The state |2,-1⟩ is a member of the l=2 multiplet. So the expansion coefficients for each m1 and m2 can be found from the CG coefficients.

Wait, another approach: the state |l=2, m=-1⟩ can be written in terms of |m1, m2⟩ as:

sum_{m1 + m2 = -1} CG(1,1; 2, -1) |m1, m2⟩.

The CG coefficients for this can be found from standard tables.

Looking up the CG coefficients for adding two l=1's into l=2, the coefficients for m=-1 are:

For m1=-1, m2=0: coefficient is sqrt(1/3)

For m1=0, m2=-1: coefficient is sqrt(2/3)

So the state is:

|2, -1⟩ = sqrt(1/3) |m1=-1, m2=0⟩ + sqrt(2/3) |m1=0, m2=-1⟩.

Wait, but wait, I think the coefficients are actually the other way around. Because when m is lower, the coefficients might be different.

Alternatively, perhaps the coefficients for m=-1 are:

sqrt(2/3) |m1=-1, m2=0⟩ + sqrt(1/3) |m1=0, m2=-1⟩.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here. Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible states for l=2.

The state |l=2, m=2⟩ is just |1,1⟩ |1,1⟩. Similarly, |l=2, m=1⟩ is a combination of |1,1⟩ |1,0⟩ and |1,0⟩ |1,1⟩, each with the same coefficient, perhaps sqrt(1/2) each.

Wait, no, actually, the state |l=2, m=1⟩ would be:

sqrt( ( (2 -1 +1) / (2(2+1)) )) |1,1⟩ |1,0⟩ + sqrt( ( (2 - 0 +1) / (2(2+1)) )) |1,0⟩ |1,1⟩.

Wait, that might not be the correct approach. Alternatively, perhaps using recursion relations would help.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the coefficients for m=-1.

Wait, another approach: the state |l=2, m=-2⟩ would be |m1=-1, m2=-1⟩. Because m1 + m2 = -2.

But for m=-1, the possible m1 and m2 pairs are (-1, 0) and (0, -1).

Now, for each of these pairs, the CG coefficients can be found.

I found a source online (from memory) that the CG coefficients for two l=1's to l=2 are as follows:

For m=2: 1 * |1,1⟩ |1,1⟩.

For m=1: (1/√2) |1,1⟩ |1,0⟩ + (1/√2) |1,0⟩ |1,1⟩.

For m=0: (1/3)^0.5 |1,1⟩ |1,-1⟩ + (1/3)^0.5 |1,0⟩ |1,0⟩ + (1/3)^0.5 |1,-1⟩ |1,1⟩.

For m=-1: (1/√3) |1,-1⟩ |1,0⟩ + (sqrt(2/3)) |1,0⟩ |1,-1⟩.

Wait, that's the point. So for m=-1, the coefficients are sqrt(1/3) and sqrt(2/3).

Wait, but which term comes first?

In the state |2, -1⟩, it's:

√(1/3) |m1=-1, m2=0⟩ + √(2/3) |m1=0, m2=-1⟩.

So the state is written as:

|2,-1⟩ = sqrt(1/3) |m1=-1, m2=0⟩ + sqrt(2/3) |m1=0, m2=-1⟩.

But wait, the problem is about measuring both L1z and L2z. So each term in this expansion is a product state where L1z is m1 * ħ and L2z is m2 * ħ.

The question is, what is the probability that both L1z and L2z are -ħ.

That would require m1 = -1 and m2 = -1.

Wait, because L1z = m1 * ħ, so m1 has to be -1 for L1z to be -ħ. Similarly for m2.

But looking at the state |2,-1>, it's a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0⟩ and |m1=0, m2=-1⟩.

In neither of these terms does both m1 and m2 equal -1. So in the state |2,-1⟩, the combined state where both m1 and m2 are -1 does not appear. Because m1 + m2 = -1, so if m1=-1, m2=0; if m1=0, m2=-1.

So the state |2,-1> has zero amplitude for the |m1=-1, m2=-1> state, because m1 + m2 would be -2, which doesn't contribute to m=-1.

Therefore, the probability of both m1 and m2 being -1 is zero.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. Because in our expansion, the combined state has m1=-1, m2=0 and m1=0, m2=-1. So in neither case do both m's equal -1.

So the probability of measuring m1=-1 and m2=-1 is zero.

Thus, the joint probability of getting both L1z and L2z as -ħ is zero.

So the answer should be D) 0.


To solve the problem, we analyze the given coupled angular momentum state \(|l_1, l_2, l, m\rangle = |1,1,2,-1\rangle\). Here, \(l_1 = 1\) and \(l_2 = 1\) are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons, \(l = 2\) is the total angular momentum quantum number, and \(m = -1\) is the z-component of the total angular momentum. The goal is to determine the joint probability of measuring both \(L_{1z}\) and \(L_{2z}\) as \(-\hbar\), which corresponds to \(m_1 = -1\) and \(m_2 = -1\).

### Step 1: Expansion of the Coupled State
The coupled state \(|1,1,2,-1\rangle\) can be expressed as a linear combination of the product states \(|m_1, m_2\rangle\), where \(m_1\) and \(m_2\) are the z-components of the orbital angular momentum for the two electrons. The condition \(m_1 + m_2 = m = -1\) gives the possible pairs \((m_1, m_2)\) as:
- \((-1, 0)\)
- \((0, -1)\)

Thus, the state can be written as:
\[
|1,1,2,-1\rangle = \sqrt{\frac{1}{3}} |m_1 = -1, m_2 = 0\rangle + \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} |m_1 = 0, m_2 = -1\rangle
\]

### Step 2: Probability of Measuring \(m_1 = -1\) and \(m_2 = -1\)
The problem asks for the joint probability of measuring both \(L_{1z}\) and \(L_{2z}\) as \(-\hbar\), which corresponds to \(m_1 = -1\) and \(m_2 = -1\). However, in the expansion of \(|1,1,2,-1\rangle\), the product state \(|m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\rangle\) does not appear. This is because \(m_1 + m_2 = -2\) in this case, which does not satisfy the condition \(m_1 + m_2 = -1\).

### Step 3: Conclusion
Since the state \(|m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\rangle\) is not present in the expansion of \(|1,1,2,-1\rangle\), the amplitude (and hence the probability) of measuring \(m_1 = -1\) and \(m_2 = -1\) is zero.

### Final Answer
The joint probability of getting both \(L_{1z}\) and \(L_{2z}\) as \(-\hbar\) is:
