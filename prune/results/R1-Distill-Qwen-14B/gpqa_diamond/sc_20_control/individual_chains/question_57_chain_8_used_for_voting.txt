Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Hmm, it's about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question gives me several phase shifts: δ₀ is 90 degrees, δ₁ is 67, δ₂ is 55, δ₃ is 30, and δ₄ is 13 degrees. Oh wait, and the rest are ignored. I remember that phase shifts are part of the scattering amplitude in quantum mechanics. The problem is asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm.

Wait, what's the formula for the scattering amplitude? I think it's something like:

f(θ) = (1/k) * Σ [ (2l + 1) * e^{2iδ_l} sin(δ_l) ]

But wait, I'm not sure if that's right. Oh right! The scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by the sum over all angular momenta l of (2l+1) times e^{2iδ_l} times sin(δ_l) divided by something. Wait, no, maybe it's f(θ) = 4π/k² times the sum of (2l+1)e^{2iδ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ), where P_l is the Legendre polynomial.

Wait, but the question is specifically about the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. The incident beam direction would correspond to θ = 0, right? Because in scattering, θ is the angle between the incident and scattered particles. So when θ is zero, the particles are moving in the same direction as the incident beam.

Wait, so when θ is zero, the Legendre polynomial P_l(cosθ) becomes P_l(1). And P_l(1) is 1 for all l, because P_l(1) = 1. So for θ=0, each term in the sum is (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} sin δ_l.

So then the scattering amplitude f(0) would be (4π/k²) * Σ (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} sin δ_l.

But wait, the question asks for the imaginary part of f along the incident direction. So Im[f(0)] is what I'm looking for.

But wait, let's think again. The amplitude is f(θ), and the cross-section depends on |f|². But here, it's about the imaginary part of f.

So, let's break down the expression for f(0):

f(0) = (4π/k²) * Σ (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} sin δ_l.

Wait, but I can write e^{2iδ_l} as cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l). Then, when I multiply this by sin δ_l, I get:

(2l+1) [ cos(2δ_l) sin δ_l + i sin(2δ_l) sin δ_l ].

But wait, the term e^{2iδ_l} sin δ_l would be [cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l)] * sin δ_l.

So the imaginary part of each term (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} sin δ_l is (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) sin δ_l.

Wait, that's because the imaginary part comes from the i multiplied by sin(2δ_l) sin δ_l. So the overall imaginary part of f(0) would be (4π/k²) multiplied by the sum of (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) sin δ_l.

Wait, let me re-express this. The term (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} sin δ_l can be written as (2l+1) [ cos(2δ_l) sin δ_l + i sin(2δ_l) sin δ_l ].

So the imaginary part would be the second term, which is (2l+1) * i * sin(2δ_l) sin δ_l.

So the imaginary part of f(0) is (4π/k²) times the sum of (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) sin δ_l for each l where δ_l is given.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I'm getting this right. Let me think of a single term in the sum. For each l, the term is (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} sin δ_l.

So let me expand e^{2iδ_l} as cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l). Multiply by sin δ_l:

= (2l+1) [ cos(2δ_l) sin δ_l + i sin(2δ_l) sin δ_l ].

The imaginary part is (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) sin δ_l.

So the overall imaginary part of f(0) is (4π/k²) * sum [ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) sin δ_l ].

Wait, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me write it again.

Im[f(0)] = (4π/k²) * sum [ (2l+1) * Im( e^{2iδ_l} sin δ_l ) ]

Which is the same as (4π/k²) sum [ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) sin δ_l ]

Because the imaginary part of e^{iθ} is sinθ, so Im[e^{2iδ_l}] = sin(2δ_l). Then, when you multiply by sin δ_l, that's correct.

So the sum is over l, and in this problem, the given phase shifts are for l=0,1,2,3,4.

Wait, wait, no. Because δ₀ is given, which is l=0. So each δ_l corresponds to l=0,1,2,3,4.

So for each l in 0 to 4, I have a δ_l. The rest are ignored, as per the problem statement.

So let's compute each term.

First, let's compute each term's contribution: (2l+1) * sin(2δ_l) * sin δ_l.

Compute this for l=0,1,2,3,4.

But wait, for l=0, what is δ₀? 90 degrees, which is π/2 radians.

So let's compute each term:

l=0:

(2*0 +1) = 1.

sin(2δ₀)= sin(180 degrees) = sin(π) =0. So the term is 1 * 0 * sin(90) = 0.

l=1:

δ₁ =67 degrees.

Compute sin(2*67) = sin(134 degrees) ≈ sin(180-46) = sin(46) ≈ 0.7193.

sin(67) ≈ 0.9205.

So term is (2*1+1)=3.

3 * (sin(134) ) * sin(67) ≈ 3 * 0.7193 * 0.9205 ≈ 3 * 0.6628 ≈ 1.9884.

l=2:

δ₂=55 degrees.

2δ=110 degrees. sin(110)= sin(70)≈0.9397.

sin(55)≈0.8192.

(2*2+1)=5.

So term: 5 * 0.9397 * 0.8192 ≈ 5 * 0.768 ≈ 3.84.

l=3:

δ=30 degrees.

2δ=60 degrees. sin(60)=√3/2≈0.8660.

sin(30)=0.5.

(2*3+1)=7.

Term:7 * 0.866 * 0.5 ≈ 7 * 0.433 ≈3.031.

l=4:

δ=13 degrees.

2δ=26 degrees. sin(26)≈0.4384.

sin(13)≈0.2249.

(2*4+1)=9.

Term:9 * 0.4384 * 0.2249 ≈9 *0.0985 ≈0.8865.

Now, sum all these terms:

l=0: 0.

l=1: ~1.9884.

l=2: ~3.84.

l=3: ~3.031.

l=4: ~0.8865.

Total sum: 1.9884 +3.84 =5.8284; +3.031=8.8594; +0.8865=9.7459.

So the sum is approximately 9.7459.

Now, the formula is Im[f(0)] = (4π/k²) * sum.

But what's k? k is the wave number. The electrons have 50 MeV energy. I need to compute k.

Wait, electrons have rest mass m_e = 0.511 MeV/c². The energy E is 50 MeV, which is much larger than the rest mass, so we can use the relativistic approximation for high energies.

The relation between energy and wave number is E = ħ c k.

Wait, but let me think. For high energies, E ≈ pc, and p=ħk. So E ≈ ħ c k.

Thus, k = E/(ħ c).

But I need to compute k in units that match. Let me make sure of the units.

Alternatively, let's compute k in terms of inverse femtometers (fm), since the options are in fm units.

We know that ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm.

So E =50 MeV.

So k = E/(ħ c) =50 / 197.33 ≈ 0.253 fm^{-1}.

So k squared is (0.253)^2 ≈0.064 (fm^-2).

Now, putting it all together.

Im[f(0)] = (4π/k²) * sum.

Sum is approximately9.7459.

So 4π ≈12.566.

k² is 0.064.

So (4π)/(k²) =12.566 /0.064 ≈196.34.

Multiply by sum:196.34 *9.7459 ≈ Approximately 196.34 *9.7459.

Let me compute that.

196.34 *9 =1767.06.

196.34 *0.7459 ≈196.34 *0.7=137.438; 196.34*0.0459≈9. So approximately 137.438 +9=146.438.

Total ≈1767.06 +146.438≈1913.5.

Wait, but wait. Wait, 9.7459 is about 9.746, so perhaps a better way to compute 196.34 *9.746.

Let me compute:

196.34 *9 = 1767.06.

196.34 *0.7 =137.438.

196.34 *0.04=7.8536.

196.34 *0.006=1.178.

Adding these: 1767.06 +137.438= 1904.498; +7.8536=1912.35; +1.178=1913.528.

So approximately 1913.53.

Wait, but wait, that's the value of (4π/k²) * sum.

But wait, the formula is Im[f(0)] = (4π/k²) * sum [ ... ].

So that gives Im[f(0)] ≈ 1913.53.

But wait, looking at the options, the options are on the order of hundreds to 87 thousand. So 1913 is not matching any of the options. Hmm, that can't be right. Did I make a mistake in my calculations?

Wait, maybe I messed up the formula. Let me go back.

Wait, the formula for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ (2l +1) e^{2iδ_l} sin(δ_l) P_l(cosθ).

Wait, perhaps I got the factor wrong. Let me think again.

Ah! Maybe I got the formula wrong. Let me double-check.

The general expression is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) [ e^{2iδ_l} sin δ_l ] P_l(cosθ).

Because when you have the partial wave expansion, the amplitude is:

f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) (e^{2iδ_l} -1) f_l (P_l(cosθ)),

where f_l is some factor. Wait, perhaps I should refer back to the partial wave expansion.

Wait, the scattering amplitude can be written as:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l +1) [ e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ] P_l(cosθ).

Wait, but that's another approach. Let me think again.

Alternatively, f(θ) is given in terms of phase shifts as:

f(θ) = (4π/k) Σ (2l+1) [ sin(δ_l) e^{i(2δ_l)} ] P_l(cosθ) / (2ik) )

Wait, perhaps I should look up the formula. But I can't right now, so I'll try to think.

Wait, in terms of the partial wave expansion, the amplitude is:

f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) f_l P_l(cosθ),

where f_l = (sin δ_l) e^{2i δ_l}.

Wait, so perhaps f_l is (e^{2i δ_l} -1) sin δ_l.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, another source says that the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) [ e^{2 i δ_l} sin δ_l ] P_l(cosθ).

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about units. The options are in femtometers, so the amplitude f should have units of length.

So if k is in fm^{-1}, then (1/k) would give fm.

So if the formula is f(θ) = (1/k) * sum (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ), then that's correct.

So then, for θ=0, P_l(1)=1, so f(0) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} sin δ_l.

So the imaginary part is (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l) sin δ_l.

So the Im[f(0)] would be (1/k) * sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) sin δ_l.

Wait, that's a different factor than I had earlier. Earlier I thought it was 4π/k², but now it's 1/k.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier step.

Wait, let me re-examine. Correct formula is f(θ) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) [e^{2i δ_l} sin δ_l ] P_l(cosθ).

So for θ=0, f(0)= (1/k) sum (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} sin δ_l.

The imaginary part is (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l) sin δ_l.

Wait, let's compute this.

So k is 50 MeV/(ħ c) ≈50/(197.33) ≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

So 1/k ≈3.953 fm.

Now, compute the sum:

sum = sum over l=0 to 4 of (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) sin δ_l.

Compute each term again.

l=0: 2l+1=1.

δ_l=90 degrees.

sin(2δ)=sin(180)=0.

term=1 * 0 * sin(90) =0.

l=1: δ=67 degrees.

sin(2*67)=sin(134)=sin(46)=≈0.7193.

sin(67)=≈0.9205.

term=3 * 0.7193 *0.9205≈3 *0.6628≈1.9884.

l=2: δ=55.

sin(110)=sin(70)=≈0.9397.

sin(55)=≈0.8192.

term=5*0.9397 *0.8192≈5 *0.768≈3.84.

l=3: δ=30.

sin(60)=≈0.8660.

sin(30)=0.5.

term=7 *0.8660 *0.5=7 *0.433≈3.031.

l=4: δ=13.

sin(26)=≈0.4384.

sin(13)=≈0.2249.

term=9 *0.4384 *0.2249≈9 *0.0985≈0.8865.

Sum these terms:

l=0: 0.

l=1:1.9884.

l=2:3.84.

l=3:3.031.

l=4:0.8865.

Sum = 1.9884 +3.84=5.8284; +3.031=8.8594; +0.8865=9.7459.

So sum≈9.7459.

Now, Im[f(0)] = (1/k) * sum = (3.953 fm) * 9.7459 ≈3.953 *9.7459 ≈38.48 fm.

Wait, but that doesn't match any of the options. The options are in the 177, 251, 355, 87k range.

Hmm, this suggests I messed up somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating k.

Wait, let's re-calculate k.

E =50 MeV.

ħ c ≈197.33 MeV fm.

So k = E/(ħ c) =50 /197.33 ≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

So 1/k ≈3.953 fm. That's correct.

Wait, but then the Im[f(0)] would be 3.953 *9.7459 ≈38.48 fm.

But none of the options are near 38. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula includes a factor of 4π. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: The formula I used is f(θ)= (1/k) sum (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ}.

But sometimes, the scattering amplitude is written as f(θ) = (4π/k) sum (2l+1) [ (e^{2iδ_l} -1) ] * (sin δ_l) P_l(cosθ}.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the units to see if that helps.

The options are in femtometers, so f must have units of length.

If the formula is f(θ)=4π/k sum ... then the units would be 4π [MeV fm]^{-1} * (dimensionless) * (dimensionless) * P_l (dimensionless) → 4π [MeV fm]^{-1}.

But MeV^{-1} is (ħ c)^{-1} (since E=ħ c k → k= E/(ħ c)), so [k] = fm^{-1}.

So 4π/k → 4π fm.

So if the formula is f(θ)=4π/k sum (2l+1) [e^{2iδ_l} -1] sin δ_l P_l(cosθ}.

Wait, that would make sense. Because [4π/k] is in fm, since k is in fm^{-1}.

So for θ=0, P_l(1)=1.

So f(0) =4π/k sum (2l+1) [e^{2iδ_l} -1] sin δ_l.

Let me expand this.

[e^{2iδ_l} -1] = [cos(2δ_l) +i sin(2δ_l) -1].

So the imaginary part comes from the i sin(2δ_l) term.

Thus, [e^{2iδ_l} -1] sin δ_l = [ (cos(2δ_l) -1) + i sin(2δ_l) ] * sin δ_l.

So the imaginary part is (2l+1) * sin(2δ_l) * sin δ_l.

Thus, Im[f(0)] = (4π/k) * sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) sin δ_l.

So that brings back the same sum as before, but with a factor of 4π/k instead of 1/k.

So in this case, the factor is (4π/k) * sum.

So let's compute this.

4π ≈12.566.

k ≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

So 4π/k ≈12.566 /0.253 ≈49.63 fm.

Then, multiply by the sum of 9.7459:

49.63 *9.7459 ≈ approximately?

49.63 *9 =446.67.

49.63 *0.7459 ≈37.03.

Total ≈446.67 +37.03=483.7.

Hmm, but that's 483.7 fm, which isn't any of the options either.

Wait, but wait. The options are B) 355.351 fm, C) 177.675 fm.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the phase shift indices.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the phase shifts are given in the order δ_0, δ_1, δ_2, δ_3, δ_4. So l=0,1,2,3,4.

Wait, but when I computed, for l=4, the term is 9 * sin(26) * sin(13), which is 9 * 0.4384 *0.2249≈0.8865.

But perhaps I should think again about the sum.

Wait, let me re-calculate the sum more accurately.

Compute each term:

l=0:

(2l+1)=1.

sin(2*90)=sin(180)=0.

term=1 *0 * sin(90)=0.

l=1:

δ=67.

sin(134)=sin(46)=0.7193.

sin(67)=approx 0.9205.

term=3 *0.7193 *0.9205.

3 *0.7193=2.1579.

2.1579 *0.9205≈1.988.

l=2:

δ=55.

sin(110)=sin(70)=0.9397.

sin(55)=approx 0.8192.

term=5 *0.9397 *0.8192.

5 *0.9397=4.6985.

4.6985 *0.8192≈3.84.

l=3:

δ=30.

sin(60)=0.8660.

sin(30)=0.5.

term=7*0.8660 *0.5=7 *0.433=3.031.

l=4:

δ=13.

sin(26)=0.4384.

sin(13)=0.22495.

term=9 *0.4384 *0.22495.

Compute 0.4384 *0.22495 ≈0.0985.

9 *0.0985≈0.8865.

Sum all terms:

0 +1.988 +3.84 +3.031 +0.8865 = let's add them step by step.

1.988 +3.84 =5.828.

5.828 +3.031=8.859.

8.859 +0.8865=9.7455.

So sum=9.7455.

Now, using the formula with 4π/k.

k=50 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm) ≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

4π/k = (4 *3.1416)/0.253 ≈12.566 /0.253 ≈49.63 fm.

Multiply by the sum:49.63 *9.7455≈49.63 *9.7455.

Let me compute this more accurately.

Compute 49.63 *9 =446.67.

49.63 *0.7455= ?

0.7 *49.63=34.741.

0.04 *49.63=1.9852.

0.0055 *49.63≈0.272965.

So 34.741 +1.9852=36.7262 +0.272965=36.999.

So total 446.67 +36.999 ≈483.67 fm.

Wait, but this gives Im[f(0)]≈483.67 fm, which isn't any of the options. The options are A)87163.4 fm, B)355.351 fm, C)177.675 fm, D)251.271 fm.

Hmm, that doesn't match. Did I mess up the formula again?

Wait, perhaps the correct formula doesn't have the 4π factor. Let me try the earlier approach without the 4π.

In that case, Im[f(0)] = (1/k) * sum.

(1/k) is 1/0.253≈3.9526 fm.

3.9526 *9.7455≈38.47 fm. Still not matching.

Wait, but another possibility: perhaps the formula is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [e^{2iδ_l} -1] sin δ_l P_l(cosθ}.

Wait, in that case, the imaginary part would be (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) sin δ_l.

So:

Im[f(0)] = (1/(2k)) * sum.

k=0.253 fm^{-1}.

1/(2k)=1/(0.506)≈1.976 fm.

So 1.976 *9.7455≈ approx 19.24 fm.

Hmm, that's still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula for the scattering amplitude. Let me think.

Another approach: The scattering amplitude in terms of the optical theorem.

Wait, the optical theorem says that the total cross-section is (4π/k) Im[f(0)].

But I'm not sure if that's helpful here.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) [e^{2iδ_l} -1] P_l(cosθ}.

Then, the imaginary part would be (1/k) sum (2l+1) Im[e^{2iδ_l} -1] P_l(cosθ}.

Im[e^{2iδ_l} -1 ] = Im[ cos(2δ_l) +i sin(2δ_l) -1 ] = sin(2δ_l) * (i) which gives the imaginary part as sin(2δ_l).

So Im[e^{2iδ_l} -1] = sin(2δ_l).

So, the imaginary part of f(θ) is (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) P_l(cosθ}.

At θ=0, P_l(1)=1.

So Im[f(0)] = (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l}.

Wait, that's different. So the sum would be (2l+1) sin(2δ_l}.

Wait, but then the Im[f(0)] is (1/k) * sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l}.

So compute that.

Sum for each l:

l=0: 1 * sin(180)=0.

l=1:3 * sin(134)≈3 *0.7193=2.1579.

l=2:5 * sin(110)=5 *0.9397≈4.6985.

l=3:7 * sin(60)=7 *0.8660≈6.062.

l=4:9 * sin(26)=9 *0.4384≈3.9456.

Sum all these:

0 +2.1579=2.1579 +4.6985=6.8564 +6.062=12.9184 +3.9456=16.864.

So sum is 16.864.

Im[f(0)] = (1/k) *16.864.

k=0.253 fm^{-1}.

So 1/k≈3.9526 fm.

3.9526 *16.864≈66.58 fm.

Still not matching any options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps there's a factor of 2I'm missing somewhere. Let me think about the formula again.

Wait, perhaps the formula is f = (4π/k) sum (2l+1) [ (e^{2iδ_l} -1) ] (sin δ_l) P_l(cosθ}.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should approach it differently.

Wait, another angle. The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the beam direction (θ=0) is related to the total cross-section via the optical theorem.

The optical theorem states that:

σ_total = (4π/k) Im[f(0)].

But I don't think that helps unless I know σ_total, which I don't.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the given options. The options are all around 177, 251, 355, or 87k.

Hmm, looking back at the sum when using 4π/k * sum:

4π/k is about 49.63 fm.

Multiply by sum 9.7455 gives 483.7 fm, which isn't an option.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula with 4π/k * sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) sin δ_l.

Wait, in that case, sum would be 9.7455, and 4π/k is 49.63.

49.63 *9.7455≈483.7 fm. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is f(0) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [e^{2iδ_l} -1] P_l(1}.

Then, the imaginary part is (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) P_l(1).

Which would be (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l}.

So sum is 16.864, as before.

Then, 1/(2k) = 1/(2 *0.253)≈1.976 fm^{-1}.

1.976 *16.864 ≈33.33 fm.

Still no match.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is f(θ) = (1/(k)) sum (2l+1) [ e^{2iδ_l} sin δ_l ] P_l(cosθ}.

In that case, the imaginary part is (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) sin δ_l.

Which brings us back to 3.953 *9.7455≈38.47 fm. Not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 in the formula. Let me think again.

Another approach: Perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [ e^{2iδ_l} -1 ] P_l(cosθ}.

So Im[f(θ)] would be (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) P_l(cosθ}.

At θ=0, P_l(1)=1.

So Im[f(0)] = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l}.

Sum is 16.864, as calculated earlier.

1/(2k) =1/(0.506)≈1.976 fm.

1.976 *16.864≈33.33 fm.

Still not matching.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is using the non-relativistic expression for k.

Wait, the electrons are at 50 MeV, but perhaps the non-relativistic approximation is being used.

In non-relativistic, E= p²/(2m).

So, p = sqrt(2m E).

But m for electrons is 0.511 MeV/c².

So E=50 MeV.

So p² =2m E → p= sqrt(2*0.511 *50) = sqrt(51.1) ≈7.15 MeV/c.

Then, k= p/(ħ c).

But ħ c is about 197.33 MeV fm.

So k=7.15 /197.33 ≈0.0362 fm^{-1}.

So 1/k≈27.61 fm.

But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach, since 50 MeV is much larger than m c² (0.511 MeV), so relativistic approach is better.

But let's try this.

Using non-relativistic:

k= p/(ħ c) = sqrt(2mE)/ (ħ c).

= sqrt(2*(0.511 MeV/c²)(50 MeV)) ) / (197.33 MeV fm).

Wait, units are getting complicated.

Alternatively,

E = (ħ² k²)/(2m) → k= sqrt(2m E)/(ħ).

But I'm not sure. Perhaps in non-relativistic:

k = (2m E)^{1/2} / ħ.

But I'm getting stuck on the units.

Alternatively, perhaps k can be calculated as k = (2m E)^{1/2}.

But I'm not confident.

Hmm, perhaps I should think of E in units where ħ c=197 MeV fm.

So the relativistic expression for k is E/(ħ c) =50 /197.33 ≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

Which I used earlier.

Hmm, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is f(0) = (4π/k²) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) sin δ_l.

In that case, 4π=12.566.

k² ≈0.064.

So 4π/k² ≈196.34.

Multiply by sum 9.7455 → 196.34 *9.7455 ≈1913.5.

Which is option A) 87163.4 fm? No, that's way bigger.

Wait, perhaps the formula is f(0) = (4π/k) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) sin δ_l.

Which would give 4π/k ≈49.63 *9.7455≈483.7 fm.

But again, none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum. Let me recalculate the sum with more precise sin values.

Compute each term accurately:

l=0:

No contribution.

l=1:

δ=67 degrees.

sin(134) = sin(180-46)= sin(46)=0.7193398003.

sin(67)=0.9205048535.

Term=3 *0.71934 *0.920505.

Compute 0.71934 *0.920505 ≈0.6628.

3 *0.6628=1.9884.

l=2:

δ=55.

sin(110)=sin(70)=0.9396926208.

sin(55)=0.8191520443.

Term=5 *0.9396926 *0.8191520443.

0.9396926 *0.8191520443 =0.767947.

5 *0.767947≈3.8397.

l=3:

δ=30.

sin(60)=0.8660254038.

sin(30)=0.5.

Term=7 *0.8660254 *0.5.

0.8660254 *0.5=0.4330127.

7 *0.4330127≈3.0310889.

l=4:

δ=13.

sin(26)=0.4383711468.

sin(13)=0.2249510543.

Term=9 *0.4383711 *0.2249510543.

0.4383711 *0.2249510543≈0.098521.

9 *0.098521≈0.886689.

Now, sum:

1.9884 +3.8397=5.8281 +3.0310889=8.8591889 +0.886689=9.7458779.

So sum≈9.745878.

Now, using the formula with 4π/k.

4π=12.566370614.

k=0.253 fm^{-1}.

4π/k ≈12.566370614/0.253≈49.63 fm.

Multiply sum:49.63 *9.745878 ≈?

Compute 49.63 *9=446.67.

49.63 *0.745878= ?

Compute 49.63 *0.7=34.741.

49.63 *0.045878≈49.63 *0.04=1.9852; 49.63 *0.005878≈0.2923.

So total≈1.9852 +0.2923=2.2775.

So 34.741 +2.2775=37.0185.

So 446.67 +37.0185=483.6885.

So Im[f(0)]≈483.69 fm. Not matching any options.

Wait, but the options don't have anything near that. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula entirely.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [e^{2iδ_l} -1] P_l(cosθ}.

Which would make Im[f(0)] = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l}.

Sum is 16.864 as before.

(1/(2k))=1/(2 *0.253)=1/0.506≈1.976 fm.

1.976 *16.864≈33.33 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

f(θ) = (4π/k) sum (2l+1) [e^{2iδ_l} -1] P_l(cosθ}.

Which would give:

Im[f(0)] = (4π/k) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l}.

Which would be 4π/k=49.63, sum 16.864.

49.63 *16.864≈837.5 fm.

Still no match.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me think differently. The options are A)87163.4 fm, B)355.351 fm, C)177.675 fm, D)251.271 fm.

Looking for numbers around 177, 251, etc.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im[f(0)] = (4π/k) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Wait, let's try that.

sum = sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

l=0:1 *1=1.

l=1:3 * sin67≈3 *0.9205≈2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin55≈5 *0.8192≈4.096.

l=3:7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin13≈9 *0.22495≈2.02455.

sum=1 +2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.02455≈13.382.

Im[f(0)] = (4π/k) *13.382.

4π=12.566.

k=0.253.

12.566/0.253≈49.63.

49.63 *13.382≈665.3 fm. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 in the denominator somewhere.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula is Im(f(0))= (4π/k) sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l).

Which would be 4π/k * sum sin δ_l.

sum sin δ_l:

l=0:90→1.

l=1:67→0.9205.

l=2:55→0.8192.

l=3:30→0.5.

l=4:13→0.22495.

sum=1 +0.9205=1.9205 +0.8192=2.7397 +0.5=3.2397 +0.22495=3.46465.

So sum≈3.46465.

Im(f(0))=4π/k *3.46465≈49.63 *3.46465≈171.7 fm.

Close to option C)177.675 fm. But not exactly.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum.

Wait, let's compute sum sin δ_l accurately.

l=0:1.

l=1: sin67=0.9205048535.

l=2: sin55=0.8191520443.

l=3: sin30=0.5.

l=4: sin13=0.2249510543.

sum=1 +0.9205048535 =1.9205048535.

+0.8191520443=2.7396568978.

+0.5=3.2396568978.

+0.2249510543=3.4646079521.

So sum≈3.464608.

4π/k=49.63.

49.63 *3.464608≈ let's compute.

49.63 *3=148.89.

49.63 *0.464608≈49.63 *0.4=19.852; 49.63 *0.064608≈3.203.

Total ≈19.852 +3.203=23.055.

So total Im(f(0))=148.89 +23.055≈171.945 fm.

Which is close to option C)177.675.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f(0))= (4π/k) sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l).

Which gives us 171.945 fm.

But the option is 177.675 fm. Close but not exact. Perhaps the initial phase shift for l=0 is 90 degrees, but perhaps in reality, the phase shift for l=0 is zero when calculating the imaginary part, because sin(2*90)=0. So perhaps l=0 doesn't contribute.

Wait, but in this formula, l=0 contributes (2*0+1)*sin(90)=1*1=1.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0))= (4π/k) sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l) sin(2δ_l).

Hmm, that would be sum (2l+1) sin δ_l sin(2δ_l) = sum (2l+1) sin δ_l (2 sin δ_l cos δ_l) )= sum (2l+1) 2 sin² δ_l cos δ_l.

But that seems more complicated.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0))= (4π/k) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) sin(δ_l).

Which is what I did earlier, giving around 483.7 fm, which isn't an option.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the fact that electrons are spin-½ particles, and their scattering might involve spin considerations, but I think the problem statement ignores that and treats it as spin-independent.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is f(θ)= (1/k) sum (2l+1) [ e^{2iδ_l} sin δ_l ] P_l(cosθ}.

Which would give Im(f(0))= (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) sin δ_l.

Which gives sum=9.745878, k=0.253 fm^{-1}.

So Im(f(0))= (1/0.253) *9.745878 ≈38.48 fm.

Not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the formula should have (2l+1) multiplied by sin(δ_l), not sin(2δ_l).

Wait, that would change things.

Wait, let me think. The imaginary part of e^{2iδ} is sin(2δ).

But perhaps the formula doesn't involve sin(2δ), but just sin δ.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Hmm.

Another thought: perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians, not degrees. But that would make the sines much smaller, which would change the sum a lot.

But the phase shifts are given in degrees, so that's unlikely.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is f(θ)= (4π/k) sum (2l+1) [ (e^{2iδ_l} -1) ] sin δ_l P_l(cosθ}.

Which would make the imaginary part (4π/k) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) sin δ_l.

Which is what I did earlier, leading to 483.69 fm.

But if that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the given phase shifts are for the partial waves but only up to l=4, and perhaps other terms contribute. But the problem says to ignore others, so only l=0 to 4 are considered.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check the sum with the correct formula.

Another approach: Perhaps the formula is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [e^{2iδ_l} -1] P_l(cosθ}.

So Im[f(0)] = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l}.

Sum for sin(2δ_l):

l=0: 1 * sin(180)=0.

l=1:3 * sin(134)=3*0.7193=2.1579.

l=2:5 * sin(110)=5 *0.9397=4.6985.

l=3:7 * sin(60)=7*0.8660=6.062.

l=4:9 * sin(26)=9*0.4384=3.9456.

Sum=0 +2.1579=2.1579 +4.6985=6.8564 +6.062=12.9184 +3.9456=16.864.

Im[f(0)] = (1/(2k)) *16.864 = (1/(2*0.253)) *16.864 ≈(1.976) *16.864≈33.33 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula is f(θ) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) [e^{2iδ_l} -1] P_l(cosθ}.

So Im[f(0)] = (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l}.

Which would be (1/0.253) *16.864 ≈66.64 fm.

Still not matching.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should accept that I'm not getting the correct formula and look for another approach.

Wait, the options are B)355.351 fm and C)177.675 fm.

Hmm, 355 is about twice 177. So perhaps I made a mistake in the sum by a factor of 2.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula should have (2l+1) multiplied by sin(δ_l), not sin(2δ_l).

Let me try that.

sum=(2l+1) sin δ_l.

sum=1*1 +3*0.9205 +5*0.8192 +7*0.5 +9*0.22495.

Compute each term:

l=0:1*1=1.

l=1:3*0.9205≈2.7615.

l=2:5*0.8192≈4.096.

l=3:7*0.5=3.5.

l=4:9*0.22495≈2.02455.

sum=1+2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.02455≈13.382.

Now, using Im[f(0)] = (4π/k) * sum.

4π=12.566.

k=0.253.

12.566/0.253≈49.63.

49.63 *13.382≈665.3 fm. Still not matching.

Wait, but 665.3 is about 177*3.75.

Not helpful.

Hmm.

Another thought: perhaps the phase shifts are given for l=0 to 4, but the formula uses only certain l values. Like, perhaps l=0 to 4 but only even or odd l's contribute.

But I don't think so because the formula uses all l's.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the phase shift for l=0 is 90 degrees, but when calculating the imaginary part, it's multiplied by sin(2δ_l), which is sin(180)=0. So the l=0 term doesn't contribute to the imaginary part.

So the sum is for l=1 to 4.

So sum =1.9884 +3.84 +3.031 +0.8865=9.7459.

Which is same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f(0)) = (4π/k) * sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) sin δ_l.

Which gives 49.63 *9.7459≈483.7 fm.

But options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a factor of π/180 somewhere because I used degrees for the sines.

Wait, no, because when I calculated sin(67 degrees), I used the value in decimal, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula requires the phase shifts to be in radians.

Ah! That's a possibility. I've been assuming the phase shifts are in degrees, but perhaps they're in radians.

Wait, but the phase shifts are given as 90, 67, etc., which are likely in degrees. 90 degrees is π/2 radians, which is about 1.5708 radians.

So if I mistakenly used radians instead of degrees, the sine values would be much smaller.

Wait, let me try that.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the phase shifts are given in degrees, so I think I did it correctly.

But perhaps I should try calculating using radians.

Compute each term with δ in radians.

l=0: δ=90 degrees=π/2 radians≈1.5708 rad.

sin(2δ)=sin(3.1416)=0.

l=1: δ=67 degrees=1.16937 radians.

sin(2δ)=sin(2.3387)= sin(≈134 degrees)=0.7193.

Wait, same value as before.

Wait, no, because sin(2.3387 rad)= sin(134 degrees)=0.7193.

So same result.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different.

Another thought: perhaps the formula is f(0) = (1/k) * sum (2l+1) [e^{2iδ_l} -1] P_l(1}.

Which is same as (1/k) sum (2l+1) [e^{2iδ_l} -1 ].

Im[f(0)] is (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l}.

Which is same as earlier, sum=16.864.

(1/k)=3.953 fm^{-1}.

3.953 *16.864≈66.58 fm.

No match.

Hmm.

I'm stuck. I think I'll have to go with the option that is closest to my earlier calculation that gave 171.9 fm, which is near option C)177.675 fm.

Wait, perhaps the sum was miscalculated. Let me recheck the sum with the formula Im(f(0))= (4π/k) sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l).

Which would be 4π/k=49.63, sum=3.4646.

49.63 *3.4646 ≈171.94 fm.

But option C is 177.675 fm, which is about 5% higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shift for l=0 is treated differently. For example, perhaps δ₀ is zero, but the problem says δ₀=90 degrees.

No, problem states to use given phase shifts.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that f(0) is the imaginary part, and the formula is Im(f(0))= (4π/k) sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l}.

Which would give 171.94 fm.

But none of the options are exactly that.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B)355.351 fm, which is about twice 177.675.

Hmm.

Wait, if I made a mistake in the formula and the correct factor is (4π/k) * sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) sin δ_l.

Which gives 483.7 fm, which is not an option.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the real part instead of the imaginary part. But the question says to find the imaginary part.

Hmm.

Wait, I'm going to have to make an educated guess. The only option that is close to the 171.94 I calculated is option C)177.675.

But I'm not certain.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, \( \text{Im}[f(0)] \), for elastic electron scattering at 50 MeV using the given phase shifts \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ, \delta_1 = 67^\circ, \delta_2 = 55^\circ, \delta_3 = 30^\circ, \delta_4 = 13^\circ \). The formula for \( \text{Im}[f(0)] \) is derived from the scattering amplitude:

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) e^{2i\delta_l} \sin(\delta_l),
\]

where \( k \) is the wave number. The imaginary part is obtained by considering the imaginary component of \( e^{2i\delta_l} \), which is \( \sin(2\delta_l) \), leading to:

\[
\text{Im}[f(0)] = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l) \sin(\delta_l).
\]

### Key Steps:
1. **Wave Number Calculation**:  
   Using \( k = \frac{E}{\hbar c} \), where \( E = 50 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( \hbar c \approx 197.33 \, \text{MeV fm} \),  
   \[
   k = \frac{50}{197.33} \approx 0.253 \, \text{fm}^{-1}.
   \]

2. **Sum Over Phase Shifts**:  
   The sum is computed for \( l = 0 \) to \( l = 4 \):  
   \[
   \text{Im}[f(0)] = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l) \sin(\delta_l).
   \]
   - For \( l = 0 \): \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ \), \( \sin(2\delta_0) = \sin(180^\circ) = 0 \), so the term is 0.  
   - For \( l = 1 \): \( \delta_1 = 67^\circ \), \( \sin(2\delta_1) = \sin(134^\circ) \approx 0.7193 \), \( \sin(\delta_1) \approx 0.9205 \),  
     \[
     \text{Term} = 3 \cdot 0.7193 \cdot 0.9205 \approx 1.988.
     \]
   - For \( l = 2 \): \( \delta_2 = 55^\circ \), \( \sin(2\delta_2) = \sin(110^\circ) \approx 0.9397 \), \( \sin(\delta_2) \approx 0.8192 \),  
     \[
     \text{Term} = 5 \cdot 0.9397 \cdot 0.8192 \approx 3.84.
     \]
   - For \( l = 3 \): \( \delta_3 = 30^\circ \), \( \sin(2\delta_3) = \sin(60^\circ) \approx 0.8660 \), \( \sin(\delta_3) = 0.5 \),  
     \[
     \text{Term} = 7 \cdot 0.8660 \cdot 0.5 \approx 3.031.
     \]
   - For \( l = 4 \): \( \delta_4 = 13^\circ \), \( \sin(2\delta_4) = \sin(26^\circ) \approx 0.4384 \), \( \sin(\delta_4) \approx 0.22495 \),  
     \[
     \text{Term} = 9 \cdot 0.4384 \cdot 0.22495 \approx 0.8865.

ANSWER: C

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Hmm, it's about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question gives me several phase shifts: δ₀ is 90 degrees, δ₁ is 67, δ₂ is 55, δ₃ is 30, and δ₄ is 13 degrees. Oh wait, and the rest are ignored. I remember that phase shifts are part of the scattering amplitude in quantum mechanics. The problem is asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm.

Wait, what's the formula for the scattering amplitude? I think it's something like:

f(θ) = (1/k) * Σ [ (2l + 1) * e^{2iδ_l} sin(δ_l) ]

But wait, I'm not sure if that's right. Oh right! The scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by the sum over all angular momenta l of (2l+1) times e^{2iδ_l} times sin(δ_l) divided by something. Wait, no, maybe it's f(θ) = 4π/k² times the sum of (2l+1)e^{2iδ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ), where P_l is the Legendre polynomial.

Wait, but the question is specifically about the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. The incident beam direction would correspond to θ = 0, right? Because in scattering, θ is the angle between the incident and scattered particles. So when θ is zero, the particles are moving in the same direction as the incident beam.

Wait, so when θ is zero, the Legendre polynomial P_l(cosθ) becomes P_l(1). And P_l(1) is 1 for all l, because P_l(1) = 1. So for θ=0, each term in the sum is (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} sin δ_l.

So then the scattering amplitude f(0) would be (4π/k²) * Σ (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} sin δ_l.

But wait, the question asks for the imaginary part of f along the incident direction. So Im[f(0)] is what I'm looking for.

But wait, let's think again. The amplitude is f(θ), and the cross-section depends on |f|². But here, it's about the imaginary part of f.

So, let's break down the expression for f(0):

f(0) = (4π/k²) * Σ (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} sin δ_l.

Wait, but I can write e^{2iδ_l} as cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l). Then, when I multiply this by sin δ_l, I get:

(2l+1) [ cos(2δ_l) sin δ_l + i sin(2δ_l) sin δ_l ].

But wait, the term e^{2iδ_l} sin δ_l would be [cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l)] * sin δ_l.

So the imaginary part of each term (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} sin δ_l is (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) sin δ_l.

Wait, that's because the imaginary part comes from the i multiplied by sin(2δ_l) sin δ_l. So the overall imaginary part of f(0) would be (4π/k²) multiplied by the sum of (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) sin δ_l.

Wait, let me re-express this. The term (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} sin δ_l can be written as (2l+1) [ cos(2δ_l) sin δ_l + i sin(2δ_l) sin δ_l ].

So the imaginary part would be the second term, which is (2l+1) * i * sin(2δ_l) sin δ_l.

So the imaginary part of f(0) is (4π/k²) times the sum of (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) sin δ_l for each l where δ_l is given.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I'm getting this right. Let me think of a single term in the sum. For each l, the term is (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} sin δ_l.

So let me expand e^{2iδ_l} as cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l). Multiply by sin δ_l:

= (2l+1) [ cos(2δ_l) sin δ_l + i sin(2δ_l) sin δ_l ].

The imaginary part is (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) sin δ_l.

So the overall imaginary part of f(0) is (4π/k²) * sum [ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) sin δ_l ].

Wait, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me write it again.

Im[f(0)] = (4π/k²) * sum [ (2l+1) * Im( e^{2iδ_l} sin δ_l ) ]

Which is the same as (4π/k²) sum [ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) sin δ_l ]

Because the imaginary part of e^{iθ} is sinθ, so Im[e^{2iδ_l}] = sin(2δ_l). Then, when you multiply by sin δ_l, that's correct.

So the sum is over l, and in this problem, the given phase shifts are for l=0,1,2,3,4.

Wait, wait, no. Because δ₀ is given, which is l=0. So each δ_l corresponds to l=0,1,2,3,4.

So for each l in 0 to 4, I have a δ_l. The rest are ignored, as per the problem statement.

So let's compute each term.

First, let's compute each term's contribution: (2l+1) * sin(2δ_l) * sin δ_l.

Compute this for l=0,1,2,3,4.

But wait, for l=0, what is δ₀? 90 degrees, which is π/2 radians.

So let's compute each term:

l=0:

(2*0 +1) = 1.

sin(2δ₀)= sin(180 degrees) = sin(π) =0. So the term is 1 * 0 * sin(90) = 0.

l=1:

δ₁ =67 degrees.

Compute sin(2*67) = sin(134 degrees) ≈ sin(180-46) = sin(46) ≈ 0.7193.

sin(67) ≈ 0.9205.

So term is (2*1+1)=3.

3 * (sin(134) ) * sin(67) ≈ 3 * 0.7193 * 0.9205 ≈ 3 * 0.6628 ≈ 1.9884.

l=2:

δ₂=55 degrees.

2δ=110 degrees. sin(110)= sin(70)≈0.9397.

sin(55)≈0.8192.

(2*2+1)=5.

So term: 5 * 0.9397 * 0.8192 ≈ 5 * 0.768 ≈ 3.84.

l=3:

δ=30 degrees.

2δ=60 degrees. sin(60)=√3/2≈0.8660.

sin(30)=0.5.

(2*3+1)=7.

Term:7 * 0.866 * 0.5 ≈ 7 * 0.433 ≈3.031.

l=4:

δ=13 degrees.

2δ=26 degrees. sin(26)≈0.4384.

sin(13)≈0.2249.

(2*4+1)=9.

Term:9 * 0.4384 * 0.2249 ≈9 *0.0985 ≈0.8865.

Now, sum all these terms:

l=0: 0.

l=1: ~1.9884.

l=2: ~3.84.

l=3: ~3.031.

l=4: ~0.8865.

Total sum: 1.9884 +3.84 =5.8284; +3.031=8.8594; +0.8865=9.7459.

So the sum is approximately 9.7459.

Now, the formula is Im[f(0)] = (4π/k²) * sum.

But what's k? k is the wave number. The electrons have 50 MeV energy. I need to compute k.

Wait, electrons have rest mass m_e = 0.511 MeV/c². The energy E is 50 MeV, which is much larger than the rest mass, so we can use the relativistic approximation for high energies.

The relation between energy and wave number is E = ħ c k.

Wait, but let me think. For high energies, E ≈ pc, and p=ħk. So E ≈ ħ c k.

Thus, k = E/(ħ c).

But I need to compute k in units that match. Let me make sure of the units.

Alternatively, let's compute k in terms of inverse femtometers (fm), since the options are in fm units.

We know that ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm.

So E =50 MeV.

So k = E/(ħ c) =50 / 197.33 ≈ 0.253 fm^{-1}.

So k squared is (0.253)^2 ≈0.064 (fm^-2).

Now, putting it all together.

Im[f(0)] = (4π/k²) * sum.

Sum is approximately9.7459.

So 4π ≈12.566.

k² is 0.064.

So (4π)/(k²) =12.566 /0.064 ≈196.34.

Multiply by sum:196.34 *9.7459 ≈ Approximately 196.34 *9.7459.

Let me compute that.

196.34 *9 =1767.06.

196.34 *0.7459 ≈196.34 *0.7=137.438; 196.34*0.0459≈9. So approximately 137.438 +9=146.438.

Total ≈1767.06 +146.438≈1913.5.

Wait, but wait. Wait, 9.7459 is about 9.746, so perhaps a better way to compute 196.34 *9.746.

Let me compute:

196.34 *9 = 1767.06.

196.34 *0.7 =137.438.

196.34 *0.04=7.8536.

196.34 *0.006=1.178.

Adding these: 1767.06 +137.438= 1904.498; +7.8536=1912.35; +1.178=1913.528.

So approximately 1913.53.

Wait, but wait, that's the value of (4π/k²) * sum.

But wait, the formula is Im[f(0)] = (4π/k²) * sum [ ... ].

So that gives Im[f(0)] ≈ 1913.53.

But wait, looking at the options, the options are on the order of hundreds to 87 thousand. So 1913 is not matching any of the options. Hmm, that can't be right. Did I make a mistake in my calculations?

Wait, maybe I messed up the formula. Let me go back.

Wait, the formula for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ (2l +1) e^{2iδ_l} sin(δ_l) P_l(cosθ).

Wait, perhaps I got the factor wrong. Let me think again.

Ah! Maybe I got the formula wrong. Let me double-check.

The general expression is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) [ e^{2iδ_l} sin δ_l ] P_l(cosθ).

Because when you have the partial wave expansion, the amplitude is:

f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) (e^{2iδ_l} -1) f_l (P_l(cosθ)),

where f_l is some factor. Wait, perhaps I should refer back to the partial wave expansion.

Wait, the scattering amplitude can be written as:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l +1) [ e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ] P_l(cosθ).

Wait, but that's another approach. Let me think again.

Alternatively, f(θ) is given in terms of phase shifts as:

f(θ) = (4π/k) Σ (2l+1) [ sin(δ_l) e^{i(2δ_l)} ] P_l(cosθ) / (2ik) )

Wait, perhaps I should look up the formula. But I can't right now, so I'll try to think.

Wait, in terms of the partial wave expansion, the amplitude is:

f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) f_l P_l(cosθ),

where f_l = (sin δ_l) e^{2i δ_l}.

Wait, so perhaps f_l is (e^{2i δ_l} -1) sin δ_l.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, another source says that the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) [ e^{2 i δ_l} sin δ_l ] P_l(cosθ).

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about units. The options are in femtometers, so the amplitude f should have units of length.

So if k is in fm^{-1}, then (1/k) would give fm.

So if the formula is f(θ) = (1/k) * sum (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ), then that's correct.

So then, for θ=0, P_l(1)=1, so f(0) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} sin δ_l.

So the imaginary part is (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l) sin δ_l.

So the Im[f(0)] would be (1/k) * sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) sin δ_l.

Wait, that's a different factor than I had earlier. Earlier I thought it was 4π/k², but now it's 1/k.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier step.

Wait, let me re-examine. Correct formula is f(θ) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) [e^{2i δ_l} sin δ_l ] P_l(cosθ).

So for θ=0, f(0)= (1/k) sum (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} sin δ_l.

The imaginary part is (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l) sin δ_l.

Wait, let's compute this.

So k is 50 MeV/(ħ c) ≈50/(197.33) ≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

So 1/k ≈3.953 fm.

Now, compute the sum:

sum = sum over l=0 to 4 of (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) sin δ_l.

Compute each term again.

l=0: 2l+1=1.

δ_l=90 degrees.

sin(2δ)=sin(180)=0.

term=1 * 0 * sin(90) =0.

l=1: δ=67 degrees.

sin(2*67)=sin(134)=sin(46)=≈0.7193.

sin(67)=≈0.9205.

term=3 * 0.7193 *0.9205≈3 *0.6628≈1.9884.

l=2: δ=55.

sin(110)=sin(70)=≈0.9397.

sin(55)=≈0.8192.

term=5*0.9397 *0.8192≈5 *0.768≈3.84.

l=3: δ=30.

sin(60)=≈0.8660.

sin(30)=0.5.

term=7 *0.8660 *0.5=7 *0.433≈3.031.

l=4: δ=13.

sin(26)=≈0.4384.

sin(13)=≈0.2249.

term=9 *0.4384 *0.2249≈9 *0.0985≈0.8865.

Sum these terms:

l=0: 0.

l=1:1.9884.

l=2:3.84.

l=3:3.031.

l=4:0.8865.

Sum = 1.9884 +3.84=5.8284; +3.031=8.8594; +0.8865=9.7459.

So sum≈9.7459.

Now, Im[f(0)] = (1/k) * sum = (3.953 fm) * 9.7459 ≈3.953 *9.7459 ≈38.48 fm.

Wait, but that doesn't match any of the options. The options are in the 177, 251, 355, 87k range.

Hmm, this suggests I messed up somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating k.

Wait, let's re-calculate k.

E =50 MeV.

ħ c ≈197.33 MeV fm.

So k = E/(ħ c) =50 /197.33 ≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

So 1/k ≈3.953 fm. That's correct.

Wait, but then the Im[f(0)] would be 3.953 *9.7459 ≈38.48 fm.

But none of the options are near 38. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula includes a factor of 4π. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: The formula I used is f(θ)= (1/k) sum (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ}.

But sometimes, the scattering amplitude is written as f(θ) = (4π/k) sum (2l+1) [ (e^{2iδ_l} -1) ] * (sin δ_l) P_l(cosθ}.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the units to see if that helps.

The options are in femtometers, so f must have units of length.

If the formula is f(θ)=4π/k sum ... then the units would be 4π [MeV fm]^{-1} * (dimensionless) * (dimensionless) * P_l (dimensionless) → 4π [MeV fm]^{-1}.

But MeV^{-1} is (ħ c)^{-1} (since E=ħ c k → k= E/(ħ c)), so [k] = fm^{-1}.

So 4π/k → 4π fm.

So if the formula is f(θ)=4π/k sum (2l+1) [e^{2iδ_l} -1] sin δ_l P_l(cosθ}.

Wait, that would make sense. Because [4π/k] is in fm, since k is in fm^{-1}.

So for θ=0, P_l(1)=1.

So f(0) =4π/k sum (2l+1) [e^{2iδ_l} -1] sin δ_l.

Let me expand this.

[e^{2iδ_l} -1] = [cos(2δ_l) +i sin(2δ_l) -1].

So the imaginary part comes from the i sin(2δ_l) term.

Thus, [e^{2iδ_l} -1] sin δ_l = [ (cos(2δ_l) -1) + i sin(2δ_l) ] * sin δ_l.

So the imaginary part is (2l+1) * sin(2δ_l) * sin δ_l.

Thus, Im[f(0)] = (4π/k) * sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) sin δ_l.

So that brings back the same sum as before, but with a factor of 4π/k instead of 1/k.

So in this case, the factor is (4π/k) * sum.

So let's compute this.

4π ≈12.566.

k ≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

So 4π/k ≈12.566 /0.253 ≈49.63 fm.

Then, multiply by the sum of 9.7459:

49.63 *9.7459 ≈ approximately?

49.63 *9 =446.67.

49.63 *0.7459 ≈37.03.

Total ≈446.67 +37.03=483.7.

Hmm, but that's 483.7 fm, which isn't any of the options either.

Wait, but wait. The options are B) 355.351 fm, C) 177.675 fm.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the phase shift indices.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the phase shifts are given in the order δ_0, δ_1, δ_2, δ_3, δ_4. So l=0,1,2,3,4.

Wait, but when I computed, for l=4, the term is 9 * sin(26) * sin(13), which is 9 * 0.4384 *0.2249≈0.8865.

But perhaps I should think again about the sum.

Wait, let me re-calculate the sum more accurately.

Compute each term:

l=0:

(2l+1)=1.

sin(2*90)=sin(180)=0.

term=1 *0 * sin(90)=0.

l=1:

δ=67.

sin(134)=sin(46)=0.7193.

sin(67)=approx 0.9205.

term=3 *0.7193 *0.9205.

3 *0.7193=2.1579.

2.1579 *0.9205≈1.988.

l=2:

δ=55.

sin(110)=sin(70)=0.9397.

sin(55)=approx 0.8192.

term=5 *0.9397 *0.8192.

5 *0.9397=4.6985.

4.6985 *0.8192≈3.84.

l=3:

δ=30.

sin(60)=0.8660.

sin(30)=0.5.

term=7*0.8660 *0.5=7 *0.433=3.031.

l=4:

δ=13.

sin(26)=0.4384.

sin(13)=0.22495.

term=9 *0.4384 *0.22495.

Compute 0.4384 *0.22495 ≈0.0985.

9 *0.0985≈0.8865.

Sum all terms:

0 +1.988 +3.84 +3.031 +0.8865 = let's add them step by step.

1.988 +3.84 =5.828.

5.828 +3.031=8.859.

8.859 +0.8865=9.7455.

So sum=9.7455.

Now, using the formula with 4π/k.

k=50 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm) ≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

4π/k = (4 *3.1416)/0.253 ≈12.566 /0.253 ≈49.63 fm.

Multiply by the sum:49.63 *9.7455≈49.63 *9.7455.

Let me compute this more accurately.

Compute 49.63 *9 =446.67.

49.63 *0.7455= ?

0.7 *49.63=34.741.

0.04 *49.63=1.9852.

0.0055 *49.63≈0.272965.

So 34.741 +1.9852=36.7262 +0.272965=36.999.

So total 446.67 +36.999 ≈483.67 fm.

Wait, but this gives Im[f(0)]≈483.67 fm, which isn't any of the options. The options are A)87163.4 fm, B)355.351 fm, C)177.675 fm, D)251.271 fm.

Hmm, that doesn't match. Did I mess up the formula again?

Wait, perhaps the correct formula doesn't have the 4π factor. Let me try the earlier approach without the 4π.

In that case, Im[f(0)] = (1/k) * sum.

(1/k) is 1/0.253≈3.9526 fm.

3.9526 *9.7455≈38.47 fm. Still not matching.

Wait, but another possibility: perhaps the formula is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [e^{2iδ_l} -1] sin δ_l P_l(cosθ}.

Wait, in that case, the imaginary part would be (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) sin δ_l.

So:

Im[f(0)] = (1/(2k)) * sum.

k=0.253 fm^{-1}.

1/(2k)=1/(0.506)≈1.976 fm.

So 1.976 *9.7455≈ approx 19.24 fm.

Hmm, that's still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula for the scattering amplitude. Let me think.

Another approach: The scattering amplitude in terms of the optical theorem.

Wait, the optical theorem says that the total cross-section is (4π/k) Im[f(0)].

But I'm not sure if that's helpful here.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) [e^{2iδ_l} -1] P_l(cosθ}.

Then, the imaginary part would be (1/k) sum (2l+1) Im[e^{2iδ_l} -1] P_l(cosθ}.

Im[e^{2iδ_l} -1 ] = Im[ cos(2δ_l) +i sin(2δ_l) -1 ] = sin(2δ_l) * (i) which gives the imaginary part as sin(2δ_l).

So Im[e^{2iδ_l} -1] = sin(2δ_l).

So, the imaginary part of f(θ) is (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) P_l(cosθ}.

At θ=0, P_l(1)=1.

So Im[f(0)] = (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l}.

Wait, that's different. So the sum would be (2l+1) sin(2δ_l}.

Wait, but then the Im[f(0)] is (1/k) * sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l}.

So compute that.

Sum for each l:

l=0: 1 * sin(180)=0.

l=1:3 * sin(134)≈3 *0.7193=2.1579.

l=2:5 * sin(110)=5 *0.9397≈4.6985.

l=3:7 * sin(60)=7 *0.8660≈6.062.

l=4:9 * sin(26)=9 *0.4384≈3.9456.

Sum all these:

0 +2.1579=2.1579 +4.6985=6.8564 +6.062=12.9184 +3.9456=16.864.

So sum is 16.864.

Im[f(0)] = (1/k) *16.864.

k=0.253 fm^{-1}.

So 1/k≈3.9526 fm.

3.9526 *16.864≈66.58 fm.

Still not matching any options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps there's a factor of 2I'm missing somewhere. Let me think about the formula again.

Wait, perhaps the formula is f = (4π/k) sum (2l+1) [ (e^{2iδ_l} -1) ] (sin δ_l) P_l(cosθ}.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should approach it differently.

Wait, another angle. The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the beam direction (θ=0) is related to the total cross-section via the optical theorem.

The optical theorem states that:

σ_total = (4π/k) Im[f(0)].

But I don't think that helps unless I know σ_total, which I don't.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the given options. The options are all around 177, 251, 355, or 87k.

Hmm, looking back at the sum when using 4π/k * sum:

4π/k is about 49.63 fm.

Multiply by sum 9.7455 gives 483.7 fm, which isn't an option.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula with 4π/k * sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) sin δ_l.

Wait, in that case, sum would be 9.7455, and 4π/k is 49.63.

49.63 *9.7455≈483.7 fm. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is f(0) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [e^{2iδ_l} -1] P_l(1}.

Then, the imaginary part is (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) P_l(1).

Which would be (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l}.

So sum is 16.864, as before.

Then, 1/(2k) = 1/(2 *0.253)≈1.976 fm^{-1}.

1.976 *16.864 ≈33.33 fm.

Still no match.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is f(θ) = (1/(k)) sum (2l+1) [ e^{2iδ_l} sin δ_l ] P_l(cosθ}.

In that case, the imaginary part is (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) sin δ_l.

Which brings us back to 3.953 *9.7455≈38.47 fm. Not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 in the formula. Let me think again.

Another approach: Perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [ e^{2iδ_l} -1 ] P_l(cosθ}.

So Im[f(θ)] would be (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) P_l(cosθ}.

At θ=0, P_l(1)=1.

So Im[f(0)] = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l}.

Sum is 16.864, as calculated earlier.

1/(2k) =1/(0.506)≈1.976 fm.

1.976 *16.864≈33.33 fm.

Still not matching.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is using the non-relativistic expression for k.

Wait, the electrons are at 50 MeV, but perhaps the non-relativistic approximation is being used.

In non-relativistic, E= p²/(2m).

So, p = sqrt(2m E).

But m for electrons is 0.511 MeV/c².

So E=50 MeV.

So p² =2m E → p= sqrt(2*0.511 *50) = sqrt(51.1) ≈7.15 MeV/c.

Then, k= p/(ħ c).

But ħ c is about 197.33 MeV fm.

So k=7.15 /197.33 ≈0.0362 fm^{-1}.

So 1/k≈27.61 fm.

But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach, since 50 MeV is much larger than m c² (0.511 MeV), so relativistic approach is better.

But let's try this.

Using non-relativistic:

k= p/(ħ c) = sqrt(2mE)/ (ħ c).

= sqrt(2*(0.511 MeV/c²)(50 MeV)) ) / (197.33 MeV fm).

Wait, units are getting complicated.

Alternatively,

E = (ħ² k²)/(2m) → k= sqrt(2m E)/(ħ).

But I'm not sure. Perhaps in non-relativistic:

k = (2m E)^{1/2} / ħ.

But I'm getting stuck on the units.

Alternatively, perhaps k can be calculated as k = (2m E)^{1/2}.

But I'm not confident.

Hmm, perhaps I should think of E in units where ħ c=197 MeV fm.

So the relativistic expression for k is E/(ħ c) =50 /197.33 ≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

Which I used earlier.

Hmm, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is f(0) = (4π/k²) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) sin δ_l.

In that case, 4π=12.566.

k² ≈0.064.

So 4π/k² ≈196.34.

Multiply by sum 9.7455 → 196.34 *9.7455 ≈1913.5.

Which is option A) 87163.4 fm? No, that's way bigger.

Wait, perhaps the formula is f(0) = (4π/k) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) sin δ_l.

Which would give 4π/k ≈49.63 *9.7455≈483.7 fm.

But again, none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum. Let me recalculate the sum with more precise sin values.

Compute each term accurately:

l=0:

No contribution.

l=1:

δ=67 degrees.

sin(134) = sin(180-46)= sin(46)=0.7193398003.

sin(67)=0.9205048535.

Term=3 *0.71934 *0.920505.

Compute 0.71934 *0.920505 ≈0.6628.

3 *0.6628=1.9884.

l=2:

δ=55.

sin(110)=sin(70)=0.9396926208.

sin(55)=0.8191520443.

Term=5 *0.9396926 *0.8191520443.

0.9396926 *0.8191520443 =0.767947.

5 *0.767947≈3.8397.

l=3:

δ=30.

sin(60)=0.8660254038.

sin(30)=0.5.

Term=7 *0.8660254 *0.5.

0.8660254 *0.5=0.4330127.

7 *0.4330127≈3.0310889.

l=4:

δ=13.

sin(26)=0.4383711468.

sin(13)=0.2249510543.

Term=9 *0.4383711 *0.2249510543.

0.4383711 *0.2249510543≈0.098521.

9 *0.098521≈0.886689.

Now, sum:

1.9884 +3.8397=5.8281 +3.0310889=8.8591889 +0.886689=9.7458779.

So sum≈9.745878.

Now, using the formula with 4π/k.

4π=12.566370614.

k=0.253 fm^{-1}.

4π/k ≈12.566370614/0.253≈49.63 fm.

Multiply sum:49.63 *9.745878 ≈?

Compute 49.63 *9=446.67.

49.63 *0.745878= ?

Compute 49.63 *0.7=34.741.

49.63 *0.045878≈49.63 *0.04=1.9852; 49.63 *0.005878≈0.2923.

So total≈1.9852 +0.2923=2.2775.

So 34.741 +2.2775=37.0185.

So 446.67 +37.0185=483.6885.

So Im[f(0)]≈483.69 fm. Not matching any options.

Wait, but the options don't have anything near that. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula entirely.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [e^{2iδ_l} -1] P_l(cosθ}.

Which would make Im[f(0)] = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l}.

Sum is 16.864 as before.

(1/(2k))=1/(2 *0.253)=1/0.506≈1.976 fm.

1.976 *16.864≈33.33 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

f(θ) = (4π/k) sum (2l+1) [e^{2iδ_l} -1] P_l(cosθ}.

Which would give:

Im[f(0)] = (4π/k) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l}.

Which would be 4π/k=49.63, sum 16.864.

49.63 *16.864≈837.5 fm.

Still no match.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me think differently. The options are A)87163.4 fm, B)355.351 fm, C)177.675 fm, D)251.271 fm.

Looking for numbers around 177, 251, etc.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im[f(0)] = (4π/k) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Wait, let's try that.

sum = sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

l=0:1 *1=1.

l=1:3 * sin67≈3 *0.9205≈2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin55≈5 *0.8192≈4.096.

l=3:7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin13≈9 *0.22495≈2.02455.

sum=1 +2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.02455≈13.382.

Im[f(0)] = (4π/k) *13.382.

4π=12.566.

k=0.253.

12.566/0.253≈49.63.

49.63 *13.382≈665.3 fm. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 in the denominator somewhere.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula is Im(f(0))= (4π/k) sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l).

Which would be 4π/k * sum sin δ_l.

sum sin δ_l:

l=0:90→1.

l=1:67→0.9205.

l=2:55→0.8192.

l=3:30→0.5.

l=4:13→0.22495.

sum=1 +0.9205=1.9205 +0.8192=2.7397 +0.5=3.2397 +0.22495=3.46465.

So sum≈3.46465.

Im(f(0))=4π/k *3.46465≈49.63 *3.46465≈171.7 fm.

Close to option C)177.675 fm. But not exactly.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum.

Wait, let's compute sum sin δ_l accurately.

l=0:1.

l=1: sin67=0.9205048535.

l=2: sin55=0.8191520443.

l=3: sin30=0.5.

l=4: sin13=0.2249510543.

sum=1 +0.9205048535 =1.9205048535.

+0.8191520443=2.7396568978.

+0.5=3.2396568978.

+0.2249510543=3.4646079521.

So sum≈3.464608.

4π/k=49.63.

49.63 *3.464608≈ let's compute.

49.63 *3=148.89.

49.63 *0.464608≈49.63 *0.4=19.852; 49.63 *0.064608≈3.203.

Total ≈19.852 +3.203=23.055.

So total Im(f(0))=148.89 +23.055≈171.945 fm.

Which is close to option C)177.675.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f(0))= (4π/k) sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l).

Which gives us 171.945 fm.

But the option is 177.675 fm. Close but not exact. Perhaps the initial phase shift for l=0 is 90 degrees, but perhaps in reality, the phase shift for l=0 is zero when calculating the imaginary part, because sin(2*90)=0. So perhaps l=0 doesn't contribute.

Wait, but in this formula, l=0 contributes (2*0+1)*sin(90)=1*1=1.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0))= (4π/k) sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l) sin(2δ_l).

Hmm, that would be sum (2l+1) sin δ_l sin(2δ_l) = sum (2l+1) sin δ_l (2 sin δ_l cos δ_l) )= sum (2l+1) 2 sin² δ_l cos δ_l.

But that seems more complicated.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0))= (4π/k) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) sin(δ_l).

Which is what I did earlier, giving around 483.7 fm, which isn't an option.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the fact that electrons are spin-½ particles, and their scattering might involve spin considerations, but I think the problem statement ignores that and treats it as spin-independent.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is f(θ)= (1/k) sum (2l+1) [ e^{2iδ_l} sin δ_l ] P_l(cosθ}.

Which would give Im(f(0))= (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) sin δ_l.

Which gives sum=9.745878, k=0.253 fm^{-1}.

So Im(f(0))= (1/0.253) *9.745878 ≈38.48 fm.

Not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the formula should have (2l+1) multiplied by sin(δ_l), not sin(2δ_l).

Wait, that would change things.

Wait, let me think. The imaginary part of e^{2iδ} is sin(2δ).

But perhaps the formula doesn't involve sin(2δ), but just sin δ.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Hmm.

Another thought: perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians, not degrees. But that would make the sines much smaller, which would change the sum a lot.

But the phase shifts are given in degrees, so that's unlikely.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is f(θ)= (4π/k) sum (2l+1) [ (e^{2iδ_l} -1) ] sin δ_l P_l(cosθ}.

Which would make the imaginary part (4π/k) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) sin δ_l.

Which is what I did earlier, leading to 483.69 fm.

But if that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the given phase shifts are for the partial waves but only up to l=4, and perhaps other terms contribute. But the problem says to ignore others, so only l=0 to 4 are considered.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check the sum with the correct formula.

Another approach: Perhaps the formula is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [e^{2iδ_l} -1] P_l(cosθ}.

So Im[f(0)] = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l}.

Sum for sin(2δ_l):

l=0: 1 * sin(180)=0.

l=1:3 * sin(134)=3*0.7193=2.1579.

l=2:5 * sin(110)=5 *0.9397=4.6985.

l=3:7 * sin(60)=7*0.8660=6.062.

l=4:9 * sin(26)=9*0.4384=3.9456.

Sum=0 +2.1579=2.1579 +4.6985=6.8564 +6.062=12.9184 +3.9456=16.864.

Im[f(0)] = (1/(2k)) *16.864 = (1/(2*0.253)) *16.864 ≈(1.976) *16.864≈33.33 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula is f(θ) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) [e^{2iδ_l} -1] P_l(cosθ}.

So Im[f(0)] = (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l}.

Which would be (1/0.253) *16.864 ≈66.64 fm.

Still not matching.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should accept that I'm not getting the correct formula and look for another approach.

Wait, the options are B)355.351 fm and C)177.675 fm.

Hmm, 355 is about twice 177. So perhaps I made a mistake in the sum by a factor of 2.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula should have (2l+1) multiplied by sin(δ_l), not sin(2δ_l).

Let me try that.

sum=(2l+1) sin δ_l.

sum=1*1 +3*0.9205 +5*0.8192 +7*0.5 +9*0.22495.

Compute each term:

l=0:1*1=1.

l=1:3*0.9205≈2.7615.

l=2:5*0.8192≈4.096.

l=3:7*0.5=3.5.

l=4:9*0.22495≈2.02455.

sum=1+2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.02455≈13.382.

Now, using Im[f(0)] = (4π/k) * sum.

4π=12.566.

k=0.253.

12.566/0.253≈49.63.

49.63 *13.382≈665.3 fm. Still not matching.

Wait, but 665.3 is about 177*3.75.

Not helpful.

Hmm.

Another thought: perhaps the phase shifts are given for l=0 to 4, but the formula uses only certain l values. Like, perhaps l=0 to 4 but only even or odd l's contribute.

But I don't think so because the formula uses all l's.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the phase shift for l=0 is 90 degrees, but when calculating the imaginary part, it's multiplied by sin(2δ_l), which is sin(180)=0. So the l=0 term doesn't contribute to the imaginary part.

So the sum is for l=1 to 4.

So sum =1.9884 +3.84 +3.031 +0.8865=9.7459.

Which is same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f(0)) = (4π/k) * sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) sin δ_l.

Which gives 49.63 *9.7459≈483.7 fm.

But options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a factor of π/180 somewhere because I used degrees for the sines.

Wait, no, because when I calculated sin(67 degrees), I used the value in decimal, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula requires the phase shifts to be in radians.

Ah! That's a possibility. I've been assuming the phase shifts are in degrees, but perhaps they're in radians.

Wait, but the phase shifts are given as 90, 67, etc., which are likely in degrees. 90 degrees is π/2 radians, which is about 1.5708 radians.

So if I mistakenly used radians instead of degrees, the sine values would be much smaller.

Wait, let me try that.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the phase shifts are given in degrees, so I think I did it correctly.

But perhaps I should try calculating using radians.

Compute each term with δ in radians.

l=0: δ=90 degrees=π/2 radians≈1.5708 rad.

sin(2δ)=sin(3.1416)=0.

l=1: δ=67 degrees=1.16937 radians.

sin(2δ)=sin(2.3387)= sin(≈134 degrees)=0.7193.

Wait, same value as before.

Wait, no, because sin(2.3387 rad)= sin(134 degrees)=0.7193.

So same result.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different.

Another thought: perhaps the formula is f(0) = (1/k) * sum (2l+1) [e^{2iδ_l} -1] P_l(1}.

Which is same as (1/k) sum (2l+1) [e^{2iδ_l} -1 ].

Im[f(0)] is (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l}.

Which is same as earlier, sum=16.864.

(1/k)=3.953 fm^{-1}.

3.953 *16.864≈66.58 fm.

No match.

Hmm.

I'm stuck. I think I'll have to go with the option that is closest to my earlier calculation that gave 171.9 fm, which is near option C)177.675 fm.

Wait, perhaps the sum was miscalculated. Let me recheck the sum with the formula Im(f(0))= (4π/k) sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l).

Which would be 4π/k=49.63, sum=3.4646.

49.63 *3.4646 ≈171.94 fm.

But option C is 177.675 fm, which is about 5% higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shift for l=0 is treated differently. For example, perhaps δ₀ is zero, but the problem says δ₀=90 degrees.

No, problem states to use given phase shifts.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that f(0) is the imaginary part, and the formula is Im(f(0))= (4π/k) sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l}.

Which would give 171.94 fm.

But none of the options are exactly that.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B)355.351 fm, which is about twice 177.675.

Hmm.

Wait, if I made a mistake in the formula and the correct factor is (4π/k) * sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) sin δ_l.

Which gives 483.7 fm, which is not an option.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the real part instead of the imaginary part. But the question says to find the imaginary part.

Hmm.

Wait, I'm going to have to make an educated guess. The only option that is close to the 171.94 I calculated is option C)177.675.

But I'm not certain.


The problem involves calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, \( \text{Im}[f(0)] \), for elastic electron scattering at 50 MeV using the given phase shifts \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ, \delta_1 = 67^\circ, \delta_2 = 55^\circ, \delta_3 = 30^\circ, \delta_4 = 13^\circ \). The formula for \( \text{Im}[f(0)] \) is derived from the scattering amplitude:

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) e^{2i\delta_l} \sin(\delta_l),
\]

where \( k \) is the wave number. The imaginary part is obtained by considering the imaginary component of \( e^{2i\delta_l} \), which is \( \sin(2\delta_l) \), leading to:

\[
\text{Im}[f(0)] = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l) \sin(\delta_l).
\]

### Key Steps:
1. **Wave Number Calculation**:  
   Using \( k = \frac{E}{\hbar c} \), where \( E = 50 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( \hbar c \approx 197.33 \, \text{MeV fm} \),  
   \[
   k = \frac{50}{197.33} \approx 0.253 \, \text{fm}^{-1}.
   \]

2. **Sum Over Phase Shifts**:  
   The sum is computed for \( l = 0 \) to \( l = 4 \):  
   \[
   \text{Im}[f(0)] = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l) \sin(\delta_l).
   \]
   - For \( l = 0 \): \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ \), \( \sin(2\delta_0) = \sin(180^\circ) = 0 \), so the term is 0.  
   - For \( l = 1 \): \( \delta_1 = 67^\circ \), \( \sin(2\delta_1) = \sin(134^\circ) \approx 0.7193 \), \( \sin(\delta_1) \approx 0.9205 \),  
     \[
     \text{Term} = 3 \cdot 0.7193 \cdot 0.9205 \approx 1.988.
     \]
   - For \( l = 2 \): \( \delta_2 = 55^\circ \), \( \sin(2\delta_2) = \sin(110^\circ) \approx 0.9397 \), \( \sin(\delta_2) \approx 0.8192 \),  
     \[
     \text{Term} = 5 \cdot 0.9397 \cdot 0.8192 \approx 3.84.
     \]
   - For \( l = 3 \): \( \delta_3 = 30^\circ \), \( \sin(2\delta_3) = \sin(60^\circ) \approx 0.8660 \), \( \sin(\delta_3) = 0.5 \),  
     \[
     \text{Term} = 7 \cdot 0.8660 \cdot 0.5 \approx 3.031.
     \]
   - For \( l = 4 \): \( \delta_4 = 13^\circ \), \( \sin(2\delta_4) = \sin(26^\circ) \approx 0.4384 \), \( \sin(\delta_4) \approx 0.22495 \),  
     \[
     \text{Term} = 9 \cdot 0.4384 \cdot 0.22495 \approx 0.8865.
     \]
   - Total sum:  
     \[
     \sum = 0 + 1.988 + 3.84 + 3.031 + 0.8865 \approx 9.7455.
     \]

3. **Final Calculation**:  
   Substituting into the formula:  
   \[
   \text{Im}[f(0)] = \frac{1}{k} \cdot \sum = \frac{1}{0.253} \cdot 9.7455 \approx 38.48 \, \text{fm}.
   \]

4. **Mismatch with Options**:  
   The calculated value \( \text{Im}[f(0)] \approx 38.48 \, \text{fm} \) does not match any of the provided options. However, the closest option is \( \text{C) 177.675 fm} \), which is approximately four times larger than the computed value. This discrepancy suggests either an error in the formula or additional factors not accounted for in the problem setup.

Given the mismatch, the most reasonable choice based on the calculations is **C) 177.675 fm**, though the exact derivation of this value remains unclear.
