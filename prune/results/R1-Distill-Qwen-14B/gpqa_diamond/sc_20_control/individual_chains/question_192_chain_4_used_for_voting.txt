Okay, so I have this physics problem about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to think through it. I remember from my classes that conductors have some interesting properties when it comes to electric fields and charges.

So the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a radius R. Inside this conductor, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is separated by a distance s from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and r is less than R. Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor.

Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. Also, the distance from point P to the center of the cavity is l. Both l and L are greater than R, so P is definitely outside. The angle between l and s is theta.

Wait, let's visualize this. The conductor is a sphere, so imagine a big sphere. Inside it, close to the center but not exactly at the center, there's a smaller cavity. The charge q is inside this cavity. Point P is outside the conductor, so outside the big sphere. From the conductor's center, P is L units away. From the cavity's center, P is l units away, and the direction makes an angle theta with the line connecting the two centers (s is the distance between the centers, so s is the separation between the centers of conductor and cavity).

I remember that when a charge is placed inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's inner surface gets induced charges, but since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must adjust accordingly. Wait, but the conductor is initially uncharged, right?

Wait, for a conductor, the charges reside on the surfaces. But in this case, there's a cavity. So when the charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the part that's the cavity's wall) must have an induced charge of -q to cancel the electric field inside the conductor material. Because the conductor is a conductor, the electric field inside it must be zero. So the cavity's inner surface must have an induced -q charge.

But wait, the conductor is neutral overall. So the outer surface must have a charge +q to balance the -q on the inner surface. So the outer surface has +q charge.

But point P is outside the conductor. So when you're outside a conductor, the electric field behaves as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. So the field at P should be the same as if all the charge were at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but in this case, the conductor has a net charge of +q on its outer surface. So the electric field outside the conductor should be due to that +q charge at the center.

So at point P, the field E would be calculated as (1/(4πε₀)) * q / (L^2), because the distance from the center is L.

Wait, but what about the position of the cavity and the charge? Does that affect the external field? Because inside the conductor, the charges rearrange to cancel the field, but outside, it's as if the charge is at the center.

So the presence of the cavity and the charge inside it affects the inner surfaces but not the external field. So the external field only depends on the total charge of the conductor, which in this case is +q.

Looking at the options, option B is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². That seems to fit.

Wait, but let me think again. Because the point P is outside, and the conductor's outer surface has charge +q, so the field would be as if +q is at the center of the conductor. So regardless of where the +q is placed inside, as long as it's inside the conductor, the external field depends only on the total charge and the distance from the conductor's center.

So in this case, the external field at P is E = (1/(4πε₀)) q / L². So option B is correct.

Wait, but what are the other options? Option A has (l-s cosθ)^2 in the denominator. That seems like it's considering the position of P relative to the cavity's center. But since the conductor's outer surface is the one contributing, and the charge is at the conductor's center, the position relative to the cavity's center shouldn't matter. So option B is correct.

To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the setup as follows:

1. **Conductor Properties**: The spherical conductor is initially uncharged. When a small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) induces a charge of $-q$ to cancel the electric field within the conductor's material. Since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have a charge of $+q$ to balance the $-q$ on the inner surface.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: For a spherical conductor, the electric field outside the conductor behaves as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor. This is due to the symmetry of the conductor and the fact that the induced charges on the inner and outer surfaces ensure the field outside depends only on the total charge of the conductor.

3. **Distance and Field Calculation**: Point $P$ is located outside the conductor at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The electric field at $P$ is thus determined by the total charge of the conductor, $+q$, and the distance $L$. Using Coulomb's law, the magnitude of the electric field is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]

4. **Irrelevance of Cavity Details**: The position of the cavity, the distance $l$ from $P$ to the cavity's center, and the angle $\theta$ do not affect the external electric field. The field outside depends only on the total charge of the conductor and the distance from its center.

5. **Correct Option**: Among the given options, only **Option B** matches the derived expression for the electric field at $P$.

**Answer: B**
