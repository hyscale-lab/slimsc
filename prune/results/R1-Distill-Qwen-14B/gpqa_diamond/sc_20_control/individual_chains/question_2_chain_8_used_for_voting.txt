Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let's take it step by step because I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with trans-cinnamaldehyde. The product is made through three steps, and we need to find out how many carbon atoms are in the final product, product 3.

First, let's write down the structure of trans-cinnamaldehyde. I remember that cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde. The structure is a benzene ring with a propenal group attached. The trans configuration means the substituents on the double bond are opposite each other. So, it's like benzaldehyde but with a vinyl group. Wait, no, cinnamaldehyde is actually benzaldehyde with a CH₂CH₂ group where one of the CH₂ is attached to the benzene. Wait, maybe I should draw the structure.

Cinnamaldehyde is C6H5-CH2-CHO? No, wait. Wait, no. I think it's C6H5-CH2-CHOH? No, maybe I'm confusing it with something else. Oh wait, cinnamaldehyde is C6H5-CH=CH-CHO. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. Cinnamaldehyde is an aldehyde with a benzene ring. The structure is benzene ring connected to a CH₂ group, which is double-bonded to another CH, making a vinyl group attached to the aldehyde.

Wait, no. Wait, I think cinnamaldehyde is actually the aldehyde derived from cinnamic acid. Cinnamic acid is C6H5-CH=CH-COOH. So, when you remove the COOH and replace it with an aldehyde group, you get C6H5-CH=CH-CHO. But wait, that can't be right because that would have four substituents on the double bond, which isn't possible. Hmm. Oh wait, maybe it's C6H5-CH₂-CHO. No, that's not right either because that would have a single bond.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the structure of trans-cinnamaldehyde. Oh wait, since I can't look it up, I have to recall. Cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde with the structure C6H5-CH2-CHO, but wait, that's not correct. No, wait, the correct structure of cinnamaldehyde is C6H5-CH=CH-CHO. Wait, but that would mean the double bond is between the two CH groups, so the structure is CH₂=CH-CHO attached to the benzene ring. But wait, that's three carbons in a row: benzene-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, no, that's not correct.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think of the formula. Cinnamaldehyde has the formula C9H8O. So, benzaldehyde is C7H6O. Cinnamaldehyde must have two more carbons. So, perhaps it's C6H5-CH2-CH2-CHO? No, that would be C9H10O, but I think cinnamaldehyde is C9H8O. Hmm.

Wait, another approach. Cinnamaldehyde has a structure where the aldehyde group is attached to a benzene via a propenyl group. So, it's C6H5-CH=CH-CHO. But wait, that would give a double bond between the two CH groups. So the structure is benzene ring connected to CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps it's C6H5-CH=CH-CHO. Let me count the carbons: benzene (6 C) + 3 (CH=CH-CHO) → 6+3=9 C. Yes, so formula is C9H8O. So the structure is trans-cinnamaldehyde. So the double bond is between the two CH groups, and the substituents on either side determine the trans configuration. So the CH=CH is between the benzene and the aldehyde.

So first reaction: trans-cinnamaldehyde is treated with methylmagnesium bromide, which is Grignard reagent. Grignard reagents react with aldehydes. The Grignard will add to the carbonyl group.

Wait, the starting material is an aldehyde, so the Grignard will add to the aldehyde. The aldehyde is RCHO, where R is the benzene with the double bond. So Grignard addition: RCHO + CH2MgBr → RCH(O-MgBr-CH3) → upon hydrolysis, RCH2OH? Wait, no, wait. Grignard adds to aldehyde: RCHO → RCH(O-)MgBr + CH3 group. So when the Grignard adds, the aldehyde (CHO) becomes CHOMgBr, then the methyl group adds. Wait, no, Grignard adds twice to ketones, but aldehydes only once. So Grignard adds once to aldehyde, giving a secondary alcohol after workup.

Wait, wait, the Grignard reaction: aldehyde (RCHO) reacts with Grignard (R'MgX) to form RCH2OR' which upon hydrolysis gives RCH2OH and R'OH? No, wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think.

Wait, no. Grignard adds to the carbonyl, so RCHO + R'MgX → RCH(OR')MgX. Then, upon hydrolysis (acid workup), it becomes RCH(OH)R', which is a secondary alcohol.

Wait, so for trans-cinnamaldehyde, which is C6H5-CH=CH-CHO, the aldehyde group is at the end. So the Grignard (methyl MgBr) will add to the aldehyde's carbonyl carbon.

So, the Grignard addition would add a methyl group to the aldehyde, turning CHO into CH(OH)CH3 after workup? No, wait, no. Let's think again.

The aldehyde is RCHO (R is C6H5-CH=CH-). Grignard adds once, so the product after workup is RCH2OH. Wait, no, wait. Wait, aldehyde has a carbonyl group (CHO). Grignard adds to the carbonyl carbon, then the oxygen gets the negative charge, which is then protonated during workup. So for RCHO, adding R'MgX gives RCH(O-R')MgX, then during hydrolysis (acid), it becomes RCH(OH)R'. So the product is RCH(OH)R'. So in this case, R is C6H5-CH=CH- and R' is methyl.

So product 1 will be C6H5-CH=CH-CH(OH)CH3.

Wait, but wait, the starting material is trans-cinnamaldehyde. So the double bond is between the two CH groups attached to the benzene. So after adding the methyl group, the structure becomes C6H5-CH=CH-CH(OH)CH3?

Wait, no. Wait, the Grignard adds to the aldehyde, which is at the end. So if the starting material is C6H5-CH=CH-CHO, the Grignard adds to the aldehyde's carbonyl, giving C6H5-CH=CH-CH(O-MgBr)(CH3), and then after quenching, becomes C6H5-CH=CH-CH(OH)CH3.

Wait, but the starting material is trans, so the double bond is trans. Let me think about the structure. The starting compound is trans-cinnamaldehyde, which has the structure C6H5-CH=CH-CHO. The double bond is between the two CH groups, and the substituents on either side are opposite each other. So after Grignard addition, the product 1 would have a secondary alcohol group on the carbon adjacent to the benzene.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the Grignard addition would add to the aldehyde group. Let me think again. Yes, Grignard reagents react with aldehydes and ketones. Aldehydes are more reactive because they're less hindered. So the Grignard would add to the aldehyde group, giving an alcohol.

So product 1 is C6H5-CH=CH-CH(OH)CH3. But wait, that's 9 carbons from the starting material (since cinnamaldehyde is C9H8O) plus one more from the methyl group? Wait, no, the starting material is C9H8O, Grignard adds a CH3 group, so product 1 is C10H12O.

Wait, but let's count carbons. Starting with C9H8O (trans-cinnamaldehyde):

After adding a methyl group (from methyl MgBr), product 1 has 9 + 1 = 10 carbons.

Wait, no. The starting material is C9H8O, which is 9 carbons. The Grignard adds a methyl group (CH3-), so the product would have 9 + 1 = 10 carbons.

So product 1: 10 carbons.

Next step: product 1 is treated with pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC), forming product 2.

PCC is a mild oxidizing agent. It oxidizes primary alcohols to aldehydes and secondary alcohols to ketones without further oxidation (unlike stronger oxidizing agents that might go to carboxylic acids or ketones to something else). So, looking at product 1, which is C6H5-CH=CH-CH(OH)CH3.

The OH is on a secondary carbon because the carbon with the OH is connected to two other carbons (the CH=CH- group and the CH3). So, when oxidized with PCC, secondary alcohols become ketones. So product 2 would be C6H5-CH=CH-C(O)CH3.

So product 2 is a ketone.

Now, structure of product 2: benzene ring connected to CH=CH-C(O)CH3.

So product 2 is a ketone with a structure like C6H5-CH=CH-C(O)CH3. So the carbons are 6 (benzene) + 2 (CH=CH) + 2 (C(O)CH3) → 6+2+2=10 carbons. So same as product 1 because oxidation doesn't add any carbons.

Now, third step: product 2 is treated with (dimethyl(oxo)-l6-sulfaneylidene)methane in DMSO at elevated temperature, forming product 3.

Wait, what is (dimethyl(oxo)-l6-sulfaneylidene)methane? Hmm, the name sounds a bit complicated. Let me parse it.

The compound is described as (dimethyl(oxo)-l6-sulfaneylidene)methane. I think that's a typo or perhaps a misinterpretation. Maybe it's dimethyl (dithiocarbamate) or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's referring to a thioketone or a thioamide?

Wait, another approach. The reagent is (dimethyl(oxo)-l6-sulfaneylidene)methane. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Wait, maybe it's dimethyl dithioketone? Alternatively, perhaps it's dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) with something else. Wait, DMSO is the solvent here. Oh wait, no, the reagent is in DMSO. So the reagent is (dimethyl(oxo)-l6-sulfaneylidene)methane, which is probably a dithiocarbamate.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is something like (CH3)2NCSO, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a thiourea derivative. Another possibility is that it's the same as dimethyl dithiocarbamate, which is used in the presence of DMSO for the formation of sulfones or other transformations.

Wait, I think this reagent is involved in a specific reaction. Let me think: Reactions that involve DMSO and such reagents. Oh, Wait! I think the reagent is dimethyl dithiocarbamate, which is used in the presence of DMSO for the formation of sulfones from ketones, perhaps through a two-electron oxidation.

Wait, but another possibility: Maybe it's the use of DMSO with a thiourea reagent for the formation of sulfones. Alternatively, there's a reaction where ketones are converted into sulfones using a reagent like DMSO and a thiourea derivative.

Alternatively, another thought: Perhaps it's a Swern oxidation, but that uses oxalyl chloride and DMSO. Or maybe it's the use of DMSO as an oxidizing agent. Wait, but in the presence of certain reagents, DMSO can act as an oxidizing agent. Wait, but the reagent here is (dimethyl(oxo)-l6-sulfaneylidene)methane. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reagent is dimethyl sulfone? No, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps it's a sulfide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck on the reagent name. Let me try to think of what reaction would involve a ketone, DMSO, and a reagent that's a dimethyl something sulfanylidene.

Wait, I remember that the formation of sulfones from ketones can be done using DMSO and a thiourea derivative. The reaction is called the Kornblum reaction or something similar, maybe the HWE (Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons) reaction? No, that's for alkenes.

Wait, the Kornblum reaction is the conversion of ketones to sulfones using DMSO and a thiourea, but I'm not entirely certain. Let me think. In the Kornblum reaction, a ketone is treated with DMSO and a thiourea (like dimethyl thiourea) to form a sulfone. The mechanism involves the thiourea attacking the carbonyl, forming a sulfonamide intermediate, and then oxidation by DMSO.

So, in this case, product 2 is a ketone: C6H5-CH=CH-C(O)CH3. So when treated with this reagent, the ketone would be converted into a sulfone group.

Wait, but wait, the product of a ketone to sulfone would replace the O of the ketone with S. So the ketone (C=O) becomes a sulfone (S=O), but actually, in the case of ketones, the conversion is to form a sulfonamide? Or perhaps it's a different process.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact product. Let me think. The Kornblum reaction converts ketones to sulfones. So R-CO-R' → R-SO2-R'. So the ketone (RCOR') becomes a sulfone (R-SO2-R').

So for product 2, which is C6H5-CH=CH-C(O)CH3, upon treatment with DMSO and dimethyl thiourea (or similar reagent), it would form C6H5-CH=CH-SO2-CH3.

Wait, but wait, that's adding a S=O group. So the ketone (O) is replaced by S.

Wait, but let me make sure. The ketone has a carbonyl group, and in the reaction, the carbonyl is converted into a sulfone group. So the product would be a sulfone.

So, product 3 would be C6H5-CH=CH-SO2-CH3.

Now, counting the carbons: benzene (6 C) + CH=CH (2 C) + SO2-CH3 (which has 1 C from the methyl group, but the sulfone is S with two O's and two R groups). So the original structure after oxidation is C6H5-CH=CH-C(O)CH3 (10 carbons). Converting the C=O to S=O would replace O with S, but the number of carbons remains the same.

Wait, but in product 2, we have 10 carbons. The product 3 would still have 10 carbons because the only change is replacing O with S and adding more O and S.

Wait, wait, no. Because in the ketone, the structure is C6H5-CH=CH-C(O)CH3. So the carbonyl is C=O, and the CH3 is attached to the carbonyl carbon. So when we replace O with S, the structure becomes C6H5-CH=CH-S(O)2-CH3. So the number of carbons is still 6 (benzene) + 2 (CH=CH) + 2 (from C(O)CH3 becomes S(O)2 CH3). So 6+2+2=10.

Wait, but wait, the original molecule before the reaction was C6H5-CH=CH-C(O)CH3, which is 10 carbons. After converting to the sulfone, it's C6H5-CH=CH-SO2-CH3, which also has 10 carbons. Because the sulfate group is replacing the carbonyl oxygen, but the carbon skeleton remains the same.

So product 3 has 10 carbons.

Wait, but wait, let me recount to be sure.

Original structure: benzene (6 C) + CH=CH (2 C) + C(O)CH3 (2 C). So 6+2+2=10.

After reaction, it's benzene (6 C) + CH=CH (2 C) + SO2CH3 (which is 1 C from CH3, but the S and O are not carbons). So 6+2+1=9. Wait, that can't be right because the ketone group is C=O and CH3. When converted to sulfone, the carbonyl carbon is now attached to SO2 and the CH3. So the number of carbons is same as before: 6 (benzene) + 2 (CH=CH) + 2 (from C(O)CH3) → 10. Because the C(O)CH3 is two carbons: the carbonyl carbon (attached to CH3). So when that becomes SO2, the structure is still two carbons (the same carbons are present; only the bonds change).

So product 3 has 10 carbons.

Wait, but let's think again. The product after oxidation is product 2: C6H5-CH=CH-C(O)CH3 (10 C). Then product 3 is formed by replacing the O in C(O)CH3 with S, making it SO2CH3. So the carbons are the same: 6 + 2 + 2 (but actually, the C(O)CH3 is the same as before, but O becomes S). So the count remains 10.

Wait, but let me think about the actual structure. The ketone is (CH2CH2C(O)CH3 attached to benzene. Wait, no, the structure is C6H5-CH=CH-C(O)CH3. So that's 6 (benzene) + 2 (CH=CH) + 2 (C(O)CH3), which is 10 carbons.

After the third reaction, which replaces the O in the ketone with SO2, the structure becomes C6H5-CH=CH-SO2-CH3. So the benzene is 6, the CH=CH is 2, and the SO2-CH3 is 1 (the CH3). So 6+2+1=9. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, because the C(O)CH3 is two carbons: the carbonyl carbon (C=O) and the CH3. When converting to sulfone, the carbonyl carbon becomes a sulfone group, so it's still attached to the same two carbons. So the number of carbons doesn't change.

Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me take a different approach. The initial molecule after step 2 is C6H5-CH=CH-C(O)CH3. So the carbonyl is between the CH=CH and the CH3. So the carbons are:

- Benzene (6 C)
- CH=CH (2 C)
- C(O)CH3 (2 C)

Total: 10 C.

In step 3, the C(O) is replaced by S(O)2, so it's now C(SO2)CH3. So the same two carbons are present. Therefore, product 3 has 10 carbons.

But wait, the question is about the number of carbons in product 3. So the answer would be 10, which is option B.

But wait, let me check the options again. The options are A)14, B)10, C)12, D)11.

So the correct answer should be B)10.

The problem involves a series of reactions starting with trans-cinnamaldehyde, and the goal is to determine the number of carbon atoms in the final product, product 3.

### Step 1: Reaction of trans-cinnamaldehyde with methylmagnesium bromide
Trans-cinnamaldehyde has the structure **C₆H₅-CH=CH-CHO**, which contains 9 carbon atoms. When treated with methylmagnesium bromide (a Grignard reagent), the aldehyde group (CHO) reacts, and a methyl group (CH₃) is added to the carbonyl carbon. After hydrolysis, the product is **C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(OH)CH₃**, which contains **10 carbon atoms** (9 from the starting material + 1 from the methyl group).

### Step 2: Oxidation of product 1 with pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC)
PCC is a mild oxidizing agent that converts secondary alcohols to ketones. The secondary alcohol in **C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(OH)CH₃** is oxidized to form **C₆H₅-CH=CH-C(O)CH₃**. This product retains the same carbon skeleton as product 1, so it also contains **10 carbon atoms**.

### Step 3: Reaction of product 2 with (dimethyl(oxo)-l6-sulfaneylidene)methane in DMSO
The reagent **(dimethyl(oxo)-l6-sulfaneylidene)methane** in DMSO is used to convert ketones into sulfones. In this reaction, the carbonyl group (C=O) in **C₆H₅-CH=CH-C(O)CH₃** is replaced by a sulfone group (SO₂), forming **C₆H₅-CH=CH-SO₂-CH₃**. The carbon skeleton remains unchanged, so the final product, **product 3**, still contains **10 carbon atoms**.

### Final Answer
The number of carbon atoms in product 3 is **10**.

Answer: B

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let's take it step by step because I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with trans-cinnamaldehyde. The product is made through three steps, and we need to find out how many carbon atoms are in the final product, product 3.

First, let's write down the structure of trans-cinnamaldehyde. I remember that cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde. The structure is a benzene ring with a propenal group attached. The trans configuration means the substituents on the double bond are opposite each other. So, it's like benzaldehyde but with a vinyl group. Wait, no, cinnamaldehyde is actually benzaldehyde with a CH₂CH₂ group where one of the CH₂ is attached to the benzene. Wait, maybe I should draw the structure.

Cinnamaldehyde is C6H5-CH2-CHO? No, wait. Wait, no. I think it's C6H5-CH2-CHOH? No, maybe I'm confusing it with something else. Oh wait, cinnamaldehyde is C6H5-CH=CH-CHO. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. Cinnamaldehyde is an aldehyde with a benzene ring. The structure is benzene ring connected to a CH₂ group, which is double-bonded to another CH, making a vinyl group attached to the aldehyde.

Wait, no. Wait, I think cinnamaldehyde is actually the aldehyde derived from cinnamic acid. Cinnamic acid is C6H5-CH=CH-COOH. So, when you remove the COOH and replace it with an aldehyde group, you get C6H5-CH=CH-CHO. But wait, that can't be right because that would have four substituents on the double bond, which isn't possible. Hmm. Oh wait, maybe it's C6H5-CH₂-CHO. No, that's not right either because that would have a single bond.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the structure of trans-cinnamaldehyde. Oh wait, since I can't look it up, I have to recall. Cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde with the structure C6H5-CH2-CHO, but wait, that's not correct. No, wait, the correct structure of cinnamaldehyde is C6H5-CH=CH-CHO. Wait, but that would mean the double bond is between the two CH groups, so the structure is CH₂=CH-CHO attached to the benzene ring. But wait, that's three carbons in a row: benzene-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, no, that's not correct.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think of the formula. Cinnamaldehyde has the formula C9H8O. So, benzaldehyde is C7H6O. Cinnamaldehyde must have two more carbons. So, perhaps it's C6H5-CH2-CH2-CHO? No, that would be C9H10O, but I think cinnamaldehyde is C9H8O. Hmm.

Wait, another approach. Cinnamaldehyde has a structure where the aldehyde group is attached to a benzene via a propenyl group. So, it's C6H5-CH=CH-CHO. But wait, that would give a double bond between the two CH groups. So the structure is benzene ring connected to CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps it's C6H5-CH=CH-CHO. Let me count the carbons: benzene (6 C) + 3 (CH=CH-CHO) → 6+3=9 C. Yes, so formula is C9H8O. So the structure is trans-cinnamaldehyde. So the double bond is between the two CH groups, and the substituents on either side determine the trans configuration. So the CH=CH is between the benzene and the aldehyde.

So first reaction: trans-cinnamaldehyde is treated with methylmagnesium bromide, which is Grignard reagent. Grignard reagents react with aldehydes. The Grignard will add to the carbonyl group.

Wait, the starting material is an aldehyde, so the Grignard will add to the aldehyde. The aldehyde is RCHO, where R is the benzene with the double bond. So Grignard addition: RCHO + CH2MgBr → RCH(O-MgBr-CH3) → upon hydrolysis, RCH2OH? Wait, no, wait. Grignard adds to aldehyde: RCHO → RCH(O-)MgBr + CH3 group. So when the Grignard adds, the aldehyde (CHO) becomes CHOMgBr, then the methyl group adds. Wait, no, Grignard adds twice to ketones, but aldehydes only once. So Grignard adds once to aldehyde, giving a secondary alcohol after workup.

Wait, wait, the Grignard reaction: aldehyde (RCHO) reacts with Grignard (R'MgX) to form RCH2OR' which upon hydrolysis gives RCH2OH and R'OH? No, wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think.

Wait, no. Grignard adds to the carbonyl, so RCHO + R'MgX → RCH(OR')MgX. Then, upon hydrolysis (acid workup), it becomes RCH(OH)R', which is a secondary alcohol.

Wait, so for trans-cinnamaldehyde, which is C6H5-CH=CH-CHO, the aldehyde group is at the end. So the Grignard (methyl MgBr) will add to the aldehyde's carbonyl carbon.

So, the Grignard addition would add a methyl group to the aldehyde, turning CHO into CH(OH)CH3 after workup? No, wait, no. Let's think again.

The aldehyde is RCHO (R is C6H5-CH=CH-). Grignard adds once, so the product after workup is RCH2OH. Wait, no, wait. Wait, aldehyde has a carbonyl group (CHO). Grignard adds to the carbonyl carbon, then the oxygen gets the negative charge, which is then protonated during workup. So for RCHO, adding R'MgX gives RCH(O-R')MgX, then during hydrolysis (acid), it becomes RCH(OH)R'. So the product is RCH(OH)R'. So in this case, R is C6H5-CH=CH- and R' is methyl.

So product 1 will be C6H5-CH=CH-CH(OH)CH3.

Wait, but wait, the starting material is trans-cinnamaldehyde. So the double bond is between the two CH groups attached to the benzene. So after adding the methyl group, the structure becomes C6H5-CH=CH-CH(OH)CH3?

Wait, no. Wait, the Grignard adds to the aldehyde, which is at the end. So if the starting material is C6H5-CH=CH-CHO, the Grignard adds to the aldehyde's carbonyl, giving C6H5-CH=CH-CH(O-MgBr)(CH3), and then after quenching, becomes C6H5-CH=CH-CH(OH)CH3.

Wait, but the starting material is trans, so the double bond is trans. Let me think about the structure. The starting compound is trans-cinnamaldehyde, which has the structure C6H5-CH=CH-CHO. The double bond is between the two CH groups, and the substituents on either side are opposite each other. So after Grignard addition, the product 1 would have a secondary alcohol group on the carbon adjacent to the benzene.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the Grignard addition would add to the aldehyde group. Let me think again. Yes, Grignard reagents react with aldehydes and ketones. Aldehydes are more reactive because they're less hindered. So the Grignard would add to the aldehyde group, giving an alcohol.

So product 1 is C6H5-CH=CH-CH(OH)CH3. But wait, that's 9 carbons from the starting material (since cinnamaldehyde is C9H8O) plus one more from the methyl group? Wait, no, the starting material is C9H8O, Grignard adds a CH3 group, so product 1 is C10H12O.

Wait, but let's count carbons. Starting with C9H8O (trans-cinnamaldehyde):

After adding a methyl group (from methyl MgBr), product 1 has 9 + 1 = 10 carbons.

Wait, no. The starting material is C9H8O, which is 9 carbons. The Grignard adds a methyl group (CH3-), so the product would have 9 + 1 = 10 carbons.

So product 1: 10 carbons.

Next step: product 1 is treated with pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC), forming product 2.

PCC is a mild oxidizing agent. It oxidizes primary alcohols to aldehydes and secondary alcohols to ketones without further oxidation (unlike stronger oxidizing agents that might go to carboxylic acids or ketones to something else). So, looking at product 1, which is C6H5-CH=CH-CH(OH)CH3.

The OH is on a secondary carbon because the carbon with the OH is connected to two other carbons (the CH=CH- group and the CH3). So, when oxidized with PCC, secondary alcohols become ketones. So product 2 would be C6H5-CH=CH-C(O)CH3.

So product 2 is a ketone.

Now, structure of product 2: benzene ring connected to CH=CH-C(O)CH3.

So product 2 is a ketone with a structure like C6H5-CH=CH-C(O)CH3. So the carbons are 6 (benzene) + 2 (CH=CH) + 2 (C(O)CH3) → 6+2+2=10 carbons. So same as product 1 because oxidation doesn't add any carbons.

Now, third step: product 2 is treated with (dimethyl(oxo)-l6-sulfaneylidene)methane in DMSO at elevated temperature, forming product 3.

Wait, what is (dimethyl(oxo)-l6-sulfaneylidene)methane? Hmm, the name sounds a bit complicated. Let me parse it.

The compound is described as (dimethyl(oxo)-l6-sulfaneylidene)methane. I think that's a typo or perhaps a misinterpretation. Maybe it's dimethyl (dithiocarbamate) or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's referring to a thioketone or a thioamide?

Wait, another approach. The reagent is (dimethyl(oxo)-l6-sulfaneylidene)methane. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Wait, maybe it's dimethyl dithioketone? Alternatively, perhaps it's dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) with something else. Wait, DMSO is the solvent here. Oh wait, no, the reagent is in DMSO. So the reagent is (dimethyl(oxo)-l6-sulfaneylidene)methane, which is probably a dithiocarbamate.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is something like (CH3)2NCSO, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a thiourea derivative. Another possibility is that it's the same as dimethyl dithiocarbamate, which is used in the presence of DMSO for the formation of sulfones or other transformations.

Wait, I think this reagent is involved in a specific reaction. Let me think: Reactions that involve DMSO and such reagents. Oh, Wait! I think the reagent is dimethyl dithiocarbamate, which is used in the presence of DMSO for the formation of sulfones from ketones, perhaps through a two-electron oxidation.

Wait, but another possibility: Maybe it's the use of DMSO with a thiourea reagent for the formation of sulfones. Alternatively, there's a reaction where ketones are converted into sulfones using a reagent like DMSO and a thiourea derivative.

Alternatively, another thought: Perhaps it's a Swern oxidation, but that uses oxalyl chloride and DMSO. Or maybe it's the use of DMSO as an oxidizing agent. Wait, but in the presence of certain reagents, DMSO can act as an oxidizing agent. Wait, but the reagent here is (dimethyl(oxo)-l6-sulfaneylidene)methane. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reagent is dimethyl sulfone? No, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps it's a sulfide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck on the reagent name. Let me try to think of what reaction would involve a ketone, DMSO, and a reagent that's a dimethyl something sulfanylidene.

Wait, I remember that the formation of sulfones from ketones can be done using DMSO and a thiourea derivative. The reaction is called the Kornblum reaction or something similar, maybe the HWE (Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons) reaction? No, that's for alkenes.

Wait, the Kornblum reaction is the conversion of ketones to sulfones using DMSO and a thiourea, but I'm not entirely certain. Let me think. In the Kornblum reaction, a ketone is treated with DMSO and a thiourea (like dimethyl thiourea) to form a sulfone. The mechanism involves the thiourea attacking the carbonyl, forming a sulfonamide intermediate, and then oxidation by DMSO.

So, in this case, product 2 is a ketone: C6H5-CH=CH-C(O)CH3. So when treated with this reagent, the ketone would be converted into a sulfone group.

Wait, but wait, the product of a ketone to sulfone would replace the O of the ketone with S. So the ketone (C=O) becomes a sulfone (S=O), but actually, in the case of ketones, the conversion is to form a sulfonamide? Or perhaps it's a different process.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact product. Let me think. The Kornblum reaction converts ketones to sulfones. So R-CO-R' → R-SO2-R'. So the ketone (RCOR') becomes a sulfone (R-SO2-R').

So for product 2, which is C6H5-CH=CH-C(O)CH3, upon treatment with DMSO and dimethyl thiourea (or similar reagent), it would form C6H5-CH=CH-SO2-CH3.

Wait, but wait, that's adding a S=O group. So the ketone (O) is replaced by S.

Wait, but let me make sure. The ketone has a carbonyl group, and in the reaction, the carbonyl is converted into a sulfone group. So the product would be a sulfone.

So, product 3 would be C6H5-CH=CH-SO2-CH3.

Now, counting the carbons: benzene (6 C) + CH=CH (2 C) + SO2-CH3 (which has 1 C from the methyl group, but the sulfone is S with two O's and two R groups). So the original structure after oxidation is C6H5-CH=CH-C(O)CH3 (10 carbons). Converting the C=O to S=O would replace O with S, but the number of carbons remains the same.

Wait, but in product 2, we have 10 carbons. The product 3 would still have 10 carbons because the only change is replacing O with S and adding more O and S.

Wait, wait, no. Because in the ketone, the structure is C6H5-CH=CH-C(O)CH3. So the carbonyl is C=O, and the CH3 is attached to the carbonyl carbon. So when we replace O with S, the structure becomes C6H5-CH=CH-S(O)2-CH3. So the number of carbons is still 6 (benzene) + 2 (CH=CH) + 2 (from C(O)CH3 becomes S(O)2 CH3). So 6+2+2=10.

Wait, but wait, the original molecule before the reaction was C6H5-CH=CH-C(O)CH3, which is 10 carbons. After converting to the sulfone, it's C6H5-CH=CH-SO2-CH3, which also has 10 carbons. Because the sulfate group is replacing the carbonyl oxygen, but the carbon skeleton remains the same.

So product 3 has 10 carbons.

Wait, but wait, let me recount to be sure.

Original structure: benzene (6 C) + CH=CH (2 C) + C(O)CH3 (2 C). So 6+2+2=10.

After reaction, it's benzene (6 C) + CH=CH (2 C) + SO2CH3 (which is 1 C from CH3, but the S and O are not carbons). So 6+2+1=9. Wait, that can't be right because the ketone group is C=O and CH3. When converted to sulfone, the carbonyl carbon is now attached to SO2 and the CH3. So the number of carbons is same as before: 6 (benzene) + 2 (CH=CH) + 2 (from C(O)CH3) → 10. Because the C(O)CH3 is two carbons: the carbonyl carbon (attached to CH3). So when that becomes SO2, the structure is still two carbons (the same carbons are present; only the bonds change).

So product 3 has 10 carbons.

Wait, but let's think again. The product after oxidation is product 2: C6H5-CH=CH-C(O)CH3 (10 C). Then product 3 is formed by replacing the O in C(O)CH3 with S, making it SO2CH3. So the carbons are the same: 6 + 2 + 2 (but actually, the C(O)CH3 is the same as before, but O becomes S). So the count remains 10.

Wait, but let me think about the actual structure. The ketone is (CH2CH2C(O)CH3 attached to benzene. Wait, no, the structure is C6H5-CH=CH-C(O)CH3. So that's 6 (benzene) + 2 (CH=CH) + 2 (C(O)CH3), which is 10 carbons.

After the third reaction, which replaces the O in the ketone with SO2, the structure becomes C6H5-CH=CH-SO2-CH3. So the benzene is 6, the CH=CH is 2, and the SO2-CH3 is 1 (the CH3). So 6+2+1=9. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, because the C(O)CH3 is two carbons: the carbonyl carbon (C=O) and the CH3. When converting to sulfone, the carbonyl carbon becomes a sulfone group, so it's still attached to the same two carbons. So the number of carbons doesn't change.

Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me take a different approach. The initial molecule after step 2 is C6H5-CH=CH-C(O)CH3. So the carbonyl is between the CH=CH and the CH3. So the carbons are:

- Benzene (6 C)
- CH=CH (2 C)
- C(O)CH3 (2 C)

Total: 10 C.

In step 3, the C(O) is replaced by S(O)2, so it's now C(SO2)CH3. So the same two carbons are present. Therefore, product 3 has 10 carbons.

But wait, the question is about the number of carbons in product 3. So the answer would be 10, which is option B.

But wait, let me check the options again. The options are A)14, B)10, C)12, D)11.

So the correct answer should be B)10.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with trans-cinnamaldehyde, and the goal is to determine the number of carbon atoms in the final product, product 3.

### Step 1: Reaction of trans-cinnamaldehyde with methylmagnesium bromide
Trans-cinnamaldehyde has the structure **C₆H₅-CH=CH-CHO**, which contains 9 carbon atoms. When treated with methylmagnesium bromide (a Grignard reagent), the aldehyde group (CHO) reacts, and a methyl group (CH₃) is added to the carbonyl carbon. After hydrolysis, the product is **C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(OH)CH₃**, which contains **10 carbon atoms** (9 from the starting material + 1 from the methyl group).

### Step 2: Oxidation of product 1 with pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC)
PCC is a mild oxidizing agent that converts secondary alcohols to ketones. The secondary alcohol in **C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(OH)CH₃** is oxidized to form **C₆H₅-CH=CH-C(O)CH₃**. This product retains the same carbon skeleton as product 1, so it also contains **10 carbon atoms**.

### Step 3: Reaction of product 2 with (dimethyl(oxo)-l6-sulfaneylidene)methane in DMSO
The reagent **(dimethyl(oxo)-l6-sulfaneylidene)methane** in DMSO is used to convert ketones into sulfones. In this reaction, the carbonyl group (C=O) in **C₆H₅-CH=CH-C(O)CH₃** is replaced by a sulfone group (SO₂), forming **C₆H₅-CH=CH-SO₂-CH₃**. The carbon skeleton remains unchanged, so the final product, **product 3**, still contains **10 carbon atoms**.

### Final Answer
The number of carbon atoms in product 3 is **10**.

Answer: B
