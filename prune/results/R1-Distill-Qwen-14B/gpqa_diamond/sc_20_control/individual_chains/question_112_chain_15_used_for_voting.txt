Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let's take it step by step.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. Wait, I remember that when a state is given as proportional to something, it just means it's a scalar multiple. So, I guess I can write |alpha> as (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, ignoring the normalization for now because I'll need to normalize it later to find probabilities.

The first part is to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator. The operator has a matrix representation A where A_ij is hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Hmm, so the matrix A is a 2x2 matrix because |up> and |down> are spin eigenstates, and spin-½ systems have two states. Let me write that matrix out.

A = [ [0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0] ].

Wait a second, that looks familiar. Oh right! That's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A is (hbar/2) * σ_x. So the eigenstates of A are the same as the eigenstates of σ_x. What are those eigenstates? I think they are the eigenstates of the σ_x operator, which are |+x> and |-x>, right? So the eigenstates are superpositions of |up> and |down>. Let me write them down.

The eigenstates of σ_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) for eigenvalue +1, and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) for eigenvalue -1. So the operator A has eigenstates |+x> and |−x> with eigenvalues (hbar/2)*1 and (hbar/2)*(-1), respectively.

Wait, no, because A is (hbar/2)σ_x, so eigenvalues would be (hbar/2)(+1) and (hbar/2)(-1), so +hbar/2 and -hbar/2. So the operator A has those as eigenvalues. So when measuring this operator, the possible outcomes are hbar/2 and -hbar/2, and the probabilities depend on the projection of |alpha> onto the |+x> and |−x> states.

So the first step is to compute the probability that the measurement gives hbar/2, which corresponds to the |+x> state, and the probability of -hbar/2, which corresponds to |−x>.

But wait, the question says "each of the eigenstates of the operator". So I need to find the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate. So I need to find the expansion of |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A.

So first, let me normalize |alpha>.

The state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down>. Let me compute the normalization factor. The norm is the inner product of alpha with itself.

So, |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down>, so the squared norm is |1+i|^2 + |2−i|^2.

Calculating each term:

|1 + i|² = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 + 1 = 2.

|2 - i|² = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5.

So the squared norm is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> = [ (1+i) |up> + (2−i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x>:

The eigenstates are:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)

|−x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, but no, wait. I think I might have the signs wrong. Let me double-check. The eigenstates of σ_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) for +1, and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) for -1. So yeah, that's correct.

So for |alpha>, which is a linear combination of |up> and |down>, I can write it as a linear combination of |+x> and |−x>.

Let me write:

|alpha> = a |+x> + b |−x>

Then, I can solve for a and b.

Expressing |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x>:

We can write:

(1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down> = a (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + b (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2)

Let me collect the coefficients for |up> and |down>:

For |up>:
(1+i) = a (1/sqrt(2)) + b (1/sqrt(2)).

For |down>:
(2−i) = a (1/sqrt(2)) + b (−1/sqrt(2)).

So these give us two equations:

(1+i) = (a + b)/sqrt(2)     [Equation 1]

(2−i) = (a − b)/sqrt(2)    [Equation 2]

I can solve these equations for a and b.

Let me write them as:

Equation 1: a + b = (1+i) sqrt(2)

Equation 2: a − b = (2−i) sqrt(2)

Now, adding the two equations:

(a + b) + (a − b) = [ (1+i)+ (2−i) ] sqrt(2)

2a = (3) sqrt(2)

=> a = (3 sqrt(2))/2.

Wait, wait a minute. Wait, (1+i) + (2−i) is (3 +0i) ?

Wait, 1+2 is 3, and i -i is zero. So yes, (1+i) + (2−i) =3.

So 2a =3 * sqrt(2) → a= (3 sqrt(2))/2.

Wait, but wait. Because when I add equations 1 and 2, I get:

Equation1 + Equation2: 2a = [ (1+i) + (2−i) ] * sqrt(2) → 2a= 3 * sqrt(2) → a= 3 sqrt(2)/2.

Similarly, subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

Equation1 - Equation2: 2b = [ (1+i) - (2−i) ] * sqrt(2)

Compute (1+i) - (2−i)= (1-2) + (i +i )= (-1) + 2i.

So 2b = (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2) → b = [ (-1 +2i) * sqrt(2) ] / 2.

So now, a = (3 sqrt(2))/2, b = ( (-1 +2i ) sqrt(2) ) / 2.

But wait, I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me re-calculate the equations.

Wait, another approach is to solve for a and b using substitution.

From equation1: a = (1+i) sqrt(2) - b.

Substitute into equation2:

( (1+i) sqrt(2) - b ) − b = (2−i) sqrt(2)

(1+i) sqrt(2) − 2b = (2−i) sqrt(2)

→ -2b = (2−i −1 −i ) sqrt(2) → 

Wait, wait, no. Let me do this correctly.

Wait equation2 is a − b = (2−i) sqrt(2).

Substituting a from equation1:

[ (1+i) sqrt(2) − b ] − b = (2−i) sqrt(2)

→ (1+i) sqrt(2) − 2b = (2−i) sqrt(2)

→ -2b = (2−i −1 −i ) sqrt(2) → 

Wait, no, perhaps it's easier to compute it correctly.

Wait:

(1+i) sqrt(2) − 2b = (2−i) sqrt(2)

Subtract (1+i) sqrt(2) from both sides:

−2b = (2−i −1 −i) sqrt(2)

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me compute correctly.

Let me subtract (1+i) sqrt(2) from both sides:

(1+i) sqrt(2) − 2b − (1+i) sqrt(2) ) = (2−i) sqrt(2) − (1+i) sqrt(2)

Which simplifies to:

-2b = [ (2−i) − (1+i) ] sqrt(2)

Compute inside the brackets:

(2−i) − (1+i) = (2-1) + (-i -i) )= 1 −2i.

So:

-2b = (1 − 2i) sqrt(2)

→ b = [ (2i −1 ) sqrt(2) ] / 2.

Wait, because 1-2i multiplied by -1 is -1 +2i. So 2b = - (1−2i)√2 → b= (2i −1)√2 /2. Hmm, but earlier when I added equations I got a=3√2/2, and when I subtracted them I got b= [ (-1 +2i ) sqrt(2) ] / 2. Which is the same as (2i−1) sqrt(2)/2. So that seems correct.

So now, the coefficients a and b are:

a = (3√2)/2,

b = (2i −1)√2/2.

Wait, but wait a second. Let's compute a squared modulus and b squared modulus to find probabilities. Because the probabilities are |a|² and |b|².

So |a|² is ( (3√2/2) )² → (9 * 2 ) /4 = 18/4 = 9/2 = 4.5. Wait, that can't be right because probabilities can't be more than 1.

Wait, that can't be. I must have made a mistake somewhere. Because probabilities can't exceed 1. So normalization must have been applied somewhere else.

Wait, no. Wait, no. Because |alpha> is already normalized. Because earlier, I normalized |alpha> to be divided by sqrt(7). So when I express |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |−x>, the coefficients a and b should satisfy |a|² + |b|² = 1.

But according to our calculation, a is 3√2/2. Let's compute |a|²: (3√2/2)^2 = (9 *2 )/4 = 18/4 = 4.5. Which is more than 1, that's impossible. So I must have made a mistake in setting up the equations.

Wait, wait. Let me go back. The problem states that |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down>. So the state is (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down>, but to get the normalized state, you divide by sqrt(7). So |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So when I express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x>, which are orthogonal and normalized, the coefficients a and b should satisfy |a|² + |b|² =1 because |alpha> is normalized.

So perhaps I made an error in the equations.

Let me set up the equations again.

We have |alpha> = c1 |+x> + c2 |−x>.

Expressed in terms of |up> and |down>, that's:

c1 (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + c2 (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) = [ (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So grouping terms:

|up> [ c1/sqrt(2) + c2/sqrt(2) ] = (1+i)/sqrt(7)

|down> [ c1/sqrt(2) - c2/sqrt(2) ] = (2−i)/sqrt(7)

So let me write this as:

( c1 + c2 ) / sqrt(2) = (1+i)/sqrt(7) → Equation 1

( c1 - c2 ) / sqrt(2) = (2−i)/sqrt(7) → Equation 2

Multiply both equations by sqrt(2):

Equation 1: c1 + c2 = (1+i) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) → (1+i)√(2/7)

Equation 2: c1 − c2 = (2−i) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) → (2−i)√(2/7)

Now, adding the two equations:

2 c1 = [ (1+i) + (2−i) ] * sqrt(2/7 )

= (3) * sqrt(2/7 )

So c1 = (3) * sqrt(2/7 ) / 2

Similarly, subtracting Equation 2 from Equation 1:

2 c2 = [ (1+i) − (2−i) ] * sqrt(2/7 )

= (1+i -2 +i ) * sqrt(2/7 )

= ( -1 + 2i ) * sqrt(2/7 )

So c2 = ( -1 + 2i ) * sqrt(2/7 ) / 2

Now, let's calculate |c1|² and |c2|².

Compute |c1|²:

c1 = 3 * sqrt(2/7) / 2

So |c1|² = (3^2 ) * (2/7) / (2^2) ) = 9*(2/7)/4 = 18/(28) = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

|c2|²:

c2 = [ (-1) + 2i ] * sqrt(2/7) / 2

The modulus squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] * (2/7) /4 → (1 +4) * (2/7) /4 → 5 * (2/7)/4 → 10/(28) )=5/14≈0.35714.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.6428, and 5/14 is about 0.3571. Adding them gives 14/14=1, which makes sense.

So the probabilities are |c1|² =9/14 ≈0.6428 and |c2|²=5/14≈0.3571.

Wait, wait, but wait. Let me compute 9/14 and 5/14.

9 ÷ 14 ≈0.642857... which is about 64.2857% and 5/14≈35.7143%.

Looking at the options, option A has 0.64 and 0.36, which is close to 0.6428 and 0.3571.

Option C has 0.28 and 0.72, which is way off.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait, but option A says 0.64, 0.36, and average hbar/7.

Wait, what's the average value of the operator A?

The average value, or expectation value, is <alpha| A |alpha>.

But since A is (hbar/2) σ_x, the expectation value is (hbar/2) <alpha| σ_x |alpha>.

Which is (hbar/2) * ( c1^2* something + ... ). Alternatively, since σ_x has eigenvalues ±1, the expectation value would be (hbar/2) times the probability of being in the +1 eigenstate minus the probability of being in the -1 eigenstate. Because when you have a two-level system, the expectation value would be (prob +1 * +1) + (prob -1 * -1) multiplied by the eigenvalue.

Wait, no. Wait, σ_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1. So the expectation value would be (prob of +1 * (+1)) + (prob of -1 * (-1)).

So that's (9/14 *1) + (5/14 * (-1)) )= (9/14 -5/14) )=4/14=2/7.

So the expectation value of σ_x is 2/7. Then, the operator A is (hbar/2) σ_x, so its expectation value is (hbar/2)*(2/7)= hbar/7.

So the average value is hbar/7.

So the options are:

A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7 → matches our findings.

But wait, let me check the other options. Option D says 0.61, 0.29 and 2hbar/sqrt(7). That's not matching. Option B's average is 3hbar/sqrt(7)—which is larger than hbar/2 (since sqrt(7)≈2.6458, so 3/sqrt(7) ≈1.133, which is bigger than 1, which is impossible because the eigenvalues of A are ±hbar/2.)

Wait no, because the operator A has eigenvalues ±hbar/2. So the expectation value must be between -hbar/2 and hbar/2. So any option with an expectation value higher than that is invalid. So option B's average is 3hbar/sqrt(7), which is approximately 1.133 * hbar. But hbar/2 is about 0.5 hbar. So that's impossible, so option B is out.

Similarly, option C's average is hbar/sqrt(7) ≈0.377 hbar, which is less than hbar/2 but higher than hbar/7, which is about 0.142 hbar.

Wait, but our calculation said the average is hbar/7, which is about 0.142 hbar. So the options are:

A) 0.64, 0.36, hbar/7 → which matches.

Wait, but let me just make sure about the average value. Another approach: compute <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

A is the matrix [[0, hbar/2],[hbar/2, 0]].

The state |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So the density matrix is |alpha><alpha|.

Compute <A> as the sum over i,j of A_ij * <alpha| i >< j | alpha >, where |i> and |j> are the basis vectors |up> (1) and |down> (2).

Wait, |up> is the first basis vector, |down> the second.

So <alpha| i> is the conjugate of the components.

Let me compute the components:

Alpha's components are (1+i)/sqrt(7) for |up>, and (2−i)/sqrt(7) for |down>.

So the conjugate is (1−i)/sqrt(7) for |up>, and (2+i)/sqrt(7) for |down>.

So <alpha|up> = (1−i)/sqrt(7)

<alpha|down> = (2+i)/sqrt(7)

So Now, A_ij is hbar/2 when i≠j, else 0.

So <A> = sum_{i,j} A_ij |<j|alpha> <alpha|i> | 

Wait, no, more accurately, <A> = sum_{i,j} A_ij <i|alpha> <alpha|j>

So, let's compute each term.

A_12 = hbar/2

A_21 = hbar/2

A_11 = 0

A_22 =0.

So the terms are:

A_11 * <up|alpha><alpha|up> = 0 * |c1|^2 = 0

A_22 * <down|alpha><alpha|down> =0 * |c2|^2=0

A_12 * <up|alpha><alpha|down> = (hbar/2) * ( (1−i)/sqrt(7) ) * ( (2−i)/sqrt(7) )

Similarly, A_21 * <down|alpha><alpha|up> = (hbar/2) * ( (2+i)/sqrt(7) ) * ( (1+i)/sqrt(7) )

So compute these two terms.

First term: A_12 component.

A_12 term: (hbar/2) * [ (1−i)(2−i) ] /7

Multiply (1−i)(2−i) = 2(1) + (1)(-i) −2i −i² → 2 −i −2i +1 → (3−3i), since i²=−1.

So (hbar/2) * (3−3i)/7 → (hbar/2) * (3(1−i))/7.

Second term: A_21 component.

( hbar/2 ) * [ (2+i)(1+i) ] /7.

Multiply (2+i)(1+i)= 2*1 + 2i +i*1 +i² → 2 +3i −1 → 1+3i.

So term is (hbar/2) * (1+3i)/7 → [ (1+3i) hbar ]/(14).

Now, add these two terms:

Total <A> = [ (3(1−i) ) hbar ] /14 + [ (1+3i) hbar ] /14.

Combine the numerators:

3(1−i) + (1+3i ) = 3 −3i +1 +3i =4.

So <A> = (4 hbar ) /14 → 2 hbar /7 → hbar/7.

Which matches our earlier calculation.

So the average is hbar/7.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is hbar/7. So the correct option is A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves an electron in the state \( |\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right) \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are the eigenstates of the \( z \)-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise. Additionally, the average value of \( A \) must be determined.

### Step 1: Eigenstates of \( A \)
The operator \( A \) is proportional to the Pauli \( \sigma_x \) matrix, with eigenvalues \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \). The corresponding eigenstates are:
\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle \right), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]
The probabilities of measuring \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \) correspond to the squared projection of \( |\alpha\rangle \) onto \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \).

### Step 2: Express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \)
The state \( |\alpha\rangle \) is given as:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]
Substituting \( |\uparrow\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |+x\rangle + |-x\rangle \right) \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |+x\rangle - |-x\rangle \right) \), we rewrite \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \):
\[
|\alpha\rangle = a|+x\rangle + b|-x\rangle,
\]
where:
\[
a = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}, \quad b = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

### Step 3: Probabilities
The probabilities of measuring \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \) are \( |a|^2 \) and \( |b|^2 \), respectively:
\[
|a|^2 = \left( \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right)^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.6429, \quad |b|^2 = \left( \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right)^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.3571.
\]
Thus, the probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \).

### Step 4: Average value of \( A \)
The average value of \( A \) is given by:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle.
\]
Using \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), the expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = |a|^2 - |b|^2 = \frac{9}{14} - \frac{5}{14} = \frac{4}{14} = \frac{2}{7}.
\]
Thus:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Step 5: Matching with options
The probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). Comparing with the options:
- **Option A**: \( 0.64, 0.36, \frac{\hbar}{7} \) matches.
- **Option B**: Incorrect average value.
- **Option C**: Incorrect probabilities.
- **Option D**: Incorrect probabilities and average value.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: A**
