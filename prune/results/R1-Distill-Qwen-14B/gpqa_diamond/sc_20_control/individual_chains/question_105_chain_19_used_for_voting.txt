Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let me read it carefully.

Alright, the question is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. So R_star = R_sun. But half of it, one hemisphere, is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%. Oh wait, what's the filling factor? I think that's the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So 20% of the hemisphere is spots. So the area covered by spots is 0.2 times the area of a hemisphere.

The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler, 1000K less. So their temperature is 5000K? I think that's right. Because the problem says the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000K. So Teff of star is 6000, spots are 5000.

The setup is that because of these spots, as the star rotates, the brightness change due to spots being in view will cause a variation in brightness. But if instead, it was an exoplanet transiting the star, what would the planet's radius need to be to produce the same amplitude in the light curve?

Wait, the problem says, if the star wasn't covered by spots, then what exoplanet radius would produce the same signal. So we're comparing two scenarios: the star with spots causing a dip in brightness, and a planet transiting causing a dip. The amplitude of the dip is the same in both cases.

So I need to find R_planet / R_star.

Let me think about the brightness variation caused by the spots. The star is rotating, so the spots come into view and go out of view, causing the star to dim a little when more spots are visible.

When the star isn't spotted, a planet transiting would block some light. The dip in brightness is proportional to the area blocked. For a planet transit, the area blocked is (R_planet / R_star)^2.

But for the spotted star, the brightness change comes from the spots being on the surface. So, the star's brightness is calculated as the sum of the unspotted part and the spotted part. When the star rotates, more or less of the spots are visible. Since only one hemisphere is spotted, as it rotates, the spots' visibility changes.

Wait, the star is a sphere, but the spots are on one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the spots come into the view of the observer. The variation in brightness would be due to the spots being on the surface that the observer sees.

So, the brightness variation due to rotation would be calculated based on the change in the visible area of the spots.

Let me model this.

First, the star's total luminosity when not considering spots would be L = 4πR²σTeff^4.

But with spots, the luminosity is the sum of the unspotted area and the spotted area.

The unspotted area is the entire star's surface minus the spotted area. Wait, the spots cover 20% of one hemisphere.

So the total surface area of the star is 4πR². Each hemisphere is 2πR². The spotted area is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4π R².

So the normal (unspotted) area is 4π R² - 0.4 π R² = 3.6 π R².

Wait no, the star's surface is all of 4π R². Spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. So 0.2 * (2π R²) = 0.4 π R². So the unspotted area is 4π R² - 0.4 π R² = 3.6 π R².

The brightness when the spots are on the far side (not visible to us) would be when we see the maximum brightness. When the spots rotate into view, the brightness decreases.

The average brightness when the star is viewed edge-on would be the brightness when half the surface is visible. Wait, no, because only one hemisphere is spotted.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think about the brightness variation as the star rotates. When the star is such that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the spots are in view, causing a dip in brightness. But when the other hemisphere (unspotted) is facing, the brightness is higher.

Wait, the star is rotating, so one hemisphere is always facing us as it spins. No, wait, no, the star is a sphere, so as it rotates, different parts come into view. But in this case, the star's spots are confined to one hemisphere. So when the star is oriented so that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the spots cover part of the visible surface.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to model the star's brightness as it rotates. The brightness will vary sinusoidally as the spots come into view and go out of view.

The maximum brightness is when the unspotted side is facing us (no spots visible), and the minimum is when the spotted side is facing us (maximum spots visible). But wait, the star is a sphere, so when we look at it, only a hemisphere is visible (assuming edge-on orbit, which is necessary for a transit, but not specified here). Wait, but for the star, 50% of its surface is visible at any time, regardless of the spots. So the spots are covering 20% of one hemisphere, which is 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1, or 10% of the star's surface area.

Wait, perhaps yes. Because the star's surface area is 4π R². Each hemisphere is 2π R². If spots cover 20% of that hemisphere, it's 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². The area of the star as seen from Earth is π R² (because we always see a hemisphere, 2π R², no, wait, no, that's the surface area of the sphere. Wait, no: the area of a sphere is 4π R². The area visible from a point is a hemisphere, so 2π R². But wait, no, no— the projection is a circle. So the area we see is π R² (the cross-sectional area). Hmm, but when we're talking about the surface of the star, the area that's visible is a hemisphere (2π R²). So when the spots are on one hemisphere, 20% of that is covered.

So the fraction of the star's surface that is spots when the spotted hemisphere is facing us is 0.2 * (2 π R²) / (4 π R²) )= 0.1 or 10% of the total surface is spots.

Wait, so when a hemisphere is spotted 20%, the fraction of the total surface that's spots is (0.2 * 2 pi R²) / (4 pi R²) )= 0.1, 10%.

So when the star is rotating such that the spotted hemisphere is visible, 10% of the surface is spots. So the area blocked is 10% of the surface.

But wait, the star's brightness isn't uniform because the spots are cooler. So the total brightness is the sum of the unspotted and spotted areas.

The star's total brightness when the spots are facing us would be L_min = (1 - 0.1) * L_normal + 0.1 * L_spot.

Wait, no. The total flux is the sum of the flux from each part. So each part emits flux according to its area and temperature.

The star without any spots has a flux F = sigma Teff^4.

The area of the star is 4 pi R^2. But when spots are present, part of the area is at T_spot = 5000 K.

So, when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F = ( (4 pi R^2 - 0.4 pi R^2) / (4 pi R^2) ) * sigma (6000)^4 + (0.4 pi R^2 / 4 pi R^2 ) * sigma (5000)^4.

Wait, let me compute that.

The unspotted area is 4 pi R^2 - 0.4 pi R^2 = 3.6 pi R^2.

So the fraction of the star's surface that is unspotted is (3.6 pi R^2) / (4 pi R^2) )= 0.9.

The fraction of spotted area is 0.4 pi R^2 / 4 pi R^2 = 0.1.

Thus, the flux when the spots are facing us is F_min = 0.9 * sigma*(6000)^4 + 0.1 * sigma*(5000)^4.

When the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, F_max = sigma*(6000)^4.

The amplitude of the brightness variation is (F_max - F_min)/F_max.

So let me compute F_max and F_min.

Compute F_max = sigma*(6000)^4.

F_min = 0.9 * sigma*(6000)^4 + 0.1 * sigma*(5000)^4.

So the difference is delta_F = F_max - F_min = sigma*(6000)^4 - [0.9 sigma (6000)^4 + 0.1 sigma (5000)^4] = 0.1 sigma (6000^4 - 5000^4).

Thus, the relative change is (delta_F) / F_max = [0.1 (6000^4 -5000^4)] / (6000^4).

Let me compute this.

Compute 6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12.

5000^4 = (5e3)^4 = 625e12.

So 6000^4 -5000^4 = (1296 -625) e12 = 671e12.

Thus, delta_F = 0.1 * 671e12 * sigma.

F_max = 1296e12 * sigma.

So delta_F / F_max = (0.1 * 671e12) / (1296e12) ) = (67.1) / 1296 ≈ 0.05174.

So about 5.174% dip.

Wait, but this is the dip caused by the spots. So the amplitude of the brightness variation is about 5.17% of the star's normal brightness.

Now, the same amplitude should be produced by a planet transiting the star. The dip in that case is (R_planet / R_star)^2, because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius ratio.

So we need (R_planet / R_star)^2 = 0.05174.

Taking the square root, R_planet / R_star = sqrt(0.05174) ≈ 0.2275.

Wait, but none of the options are around 0.23. Let's see the options:

Options are A: ~0.39, B: ~0.07, C: ~0.11, D: ~0.32.

Hmm, none of these match 0.227. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the fraction of the star's surface area that is covered by spots. Let me double-check that.

The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. So the area of one hemisphere is 2 pi R^2. 20% of that is 0.2 * 2 pi R^2 = 0.4 pi R^2.

The total area of the star is 4 pi R^2. So the fraction of the star's surface area that is spotted is 0.4 pi R^2 / 4 pi R^2 = 0.1, 10% as I had before.

But when the star is rotating, the visible hemisphere is changing. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the visible area is 2 pi R^2, but the spotted area on that hemisphere is 0.4 pi R^2. So the fraction of the visible area that is spotted is 0.4 pi R^2 / (2 pi R^2) )= 0.2, 20%.

Wait, that's a key point. Because when we look at the star, we see a hemisphere of 2 pi R^2. So if the spots are in that hemisphere, 20% of the 2 pi R^2 area is spots, so 0.4 pi R^2.

Which is 20% of the visible area.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because when considering the star's entire surface, the spots are 10% (0.4 pi /4 pi). But when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, 20% of the visible area is spots. So the flux when the spots are visible would be different.

Let me recompute.

So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the visible area is 2 pi R^2, of which 20% (0.2 * 2 pi R²) is spotted.

So the unspotted area in the visible hemisphere is 0.8 * 2 pi R² =1.6 pi R².

The spotted area is 0.4 pi R².

So the flux when the spots are visible is F = (1.6 pi R² * sigma 6000^4 + 0.4 pi R² * sigma 5000^4 ) / (4 pi R²) ) * (4 pi R²) ? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, the star's total flux is the sum of all the surface elements. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the front half (visible) has spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The back half is entirely unspotted.

So the total flux when the spots are visible would be:

Flux from the visible hemisphere: (0.8 * 2 pi R²) * sigma (6000)^4 + (0.2 * 2 pi R²) * sigma (5000)^4.

Flux from the back hemisphere: (2 pi R²) * sigma (6000)^4.

So total flux F = [ (1.6 pi R² + 0.4 pi R²) * 6000^4 sigma ] + [ 0.2 * 2 pi R² (5000^4 - 6000^4) sigma ].

Wait, perhaps I should break it down.

Total flux = (Flux from unspotted parts) + (Flux from spotted parts).

Unspotted parts: The visible hemisphere's unspotted area (1.6 pi R²) plus the entire back hemisphere (2 pi R²).

So unspotted area = 1.6 pi R² + 2 pi R² = 3.6 pi R².

Flux from unspotted: 3.6 pi R² * sigma (6000)^4.

Spotted area: 0.4 pi R².

Flux from spotted: 0.4 pi R² * sigma (5000)^4.

So total flux is F = 3.6 pi R² sigma 6000^4 + 0.4 pi R² sigma 5000^4.

When the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_max = 4 pi R² sigma 6000^4.

So the change in flux is F_max - F = 4 pi R² sigma 6000^4 - [3.6 pi R² sigma 6000^4 + 0.4 pi R² sigma 5000^4 ].

Which simplifies to 0.4 pi R² (6000^4 -5000^4) sigma.

So the relative change is (delta_F) / F_max = [0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4) ] / (4 *6000^4).

Compute 6000^4 = 6^4 * (1e3)^4 = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15 (but units are in K^4, so not relevant; just the ratio matters).

6000^4 = 1296e12, 5000^4= 625e12. Difference is 671e12.

So delta_F/F_max = (0.4 *671e12) / (4 *1296e12) ) = (268.4e12) / (5184e12) ) = 268.4 / 5184 ≈ 0.0517.

So same as before, about 5.17% dip.

So the amplitude is 5.17%.

Now, when a planet transits the star, the dip is (R_planet / R_star)^2. So we set that equal to 0.0517.

So R_planet / R_star = sqrt(0.0517) ≈ 0.2275, which is about 0.23.

Wait, but the options don't have 0.23. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, looking back, perhaps I made a mistake in the filling factor.

Wait, the problem states that one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So 20% of the hemisphere is spots.

But when the star is observed, the visible hemisphere may switch between the spotted and unspotted hemispheres as it rotates.

Wait, but the star's rotation period would cause a variation in brightness as the spots come in and out of view. The maximum dip would occur when the hemisphere with spots is fully visible.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. I'm considering that when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, it contributes to a dip. But perhaps the actual variation is smaller.

Wait, the star's surface is 4 pi R^2. Spots cover 0.2 * 2 pi R^2 = 0.4 pi R^2.

So the fraction of the star's surface that is spots is 0.4 pi R^2 /4 pi R^2 = 0.1, 10%.

When the star rotates, the visible hemisphere is either the spotted or unspotted one.

Wait, but that's not possible. The star has only one hemisphere with spots. So when the star rotates, only part of the spotted hemisphere is visible. So the maximum coverage would be when the entire spotted hemisphere is visible.

Wait, no. The star is a sphere. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the spots are on the front, and we see all of them. But when the star rotates 180 degrees, the other hemisphere (unspotted) is facing us, so we see no spots.

Wait, but in reality, the star's rotation would cause the spots to move into and out of view. For example, if the star's rotation axis is perpendicular to our line of sight (edge-on), then as it rotates, the spots come into view and go out. So the brightness variation would be a sinusoidal curve, with a dip when spots are crossing the disk.

Wait, perhaps the amplitude is not the maximum dip when the entire spotted area is blocked, but a smaller amplitude due to the partial blocking as the spots rotate.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The maximum dip would occur when the entire spotted area is in front of us, blocking as much light as possible.

In that case, the fraction of the star's surface that is blocked is 0.1 (10%), so the dip would be 0.1, or 10%. But earlier calculation gave 5% because of the temperature difference.

Wait, no, because the dip depends on the difference in brightness between the spotted and unspotted regions.

Wait, perhaps I should model the brightness variation as a sinusoidal function, considering the rotational modulation.

Wait, perhaps the brightness variation is due to the changing area of spots visible as the star rotates. So the observed brightness will have a periodic variation with an amplitude determined by the spot properties.

But this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler than that.

The question states that the situation (spots) can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. So the amplitude of the brightness variation due to spots is similar to that caused by a planet.

So the dip caused by the exoplanet is (R_p / R_star)^2. The dip caused by the spots is a certain percentage.

So to find R_p such that (R_p / R_star)^2 equals the dip caused by the spots.

But in the earlier calculation, the dip was about 5.17%, which would require R_p ~ 0.227 R_star. But none of the options match that.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I calculated F_min.

Let me redo the calculation.

F_max is when no spots are visible. So F_max = sigma * (6000)^4.

When the spots are visible, F_min is the sum of the unspotted and spotted areas.

The total area of the star is 4 pi R². The spotted area is 0.4 pi R².

So when the star is viewed such that the entire spotted area is in front, the flux is:

F_min = [ (4 pi R² - 0.4 pi R²) * sigma (6000)^4 + (0.4 pi R²) * sigma (5000)^4 ] / (4 pi R²)

Wait, no, because the star's surface is 4 pi R², but when we see it, we see a hemisphere, 2 pi R². So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the visible area is 2 pi R², of which 0.4 pi R² is spotted.

So the flux in that case is:

F_min = [ (2 pi R² - 0.4 pi R²) * sigma (6000)^4 + (0.4 pi R²) * sigma (5000)^4 ] / (4 pi R²) ) * (4 pi R²) ?

No, perhaps better to compute the fraction of the total flux.

The total flux when the entire star is unspotted is 4 pi R² sigma (6000)^4.

When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is:

( (2 pi R² - 0.4 pi R² ) * sigma (6000)^4 + 0.4 pi R^2 sigma (5000)^4 ) = [1.6 pi R² sigma (6000)^4 + 0.4 pi R² sigma (5000)^4 ].

The flux when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us is 2 pi R² sigma (6000)^4.

Wait, but the star's total flux when the spotted hemisphere is facing us would be the sum of that hemisphere's flux and the other hemisphere's flux.

Wait, no. The spot is on one hemisphere, so when that hemisphere is facing us, the spots are visible. The other hemisphere is unspotted, so when it's facing us, we don't see any spots.

So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is:

F_spotted = [ (2 pi R² - 0.4 pi R²) * 6000^4 + 0.4 pi R² 5000^4 ] * sigma.

When the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_unspotted = 2 pi R² * 6000^4 sigma.

The average flux would be the average of F_spotted and F_unspotted, but the maximum and minimum are these two values.

Wait, but the star's luminosity when the spots are visible is F_spotted, and when not, F_unspotted.

So the variation would be between these two values.

Wait, but the star is rotating, so the observed flux is a sinusoidal function.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the maximum and minimum flux.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the case when the entire spotted area is visible, leading to the maximum dip.

So the dip is F_unspotted - F_spotted.

F_unspotted = 2 pi R² sigma 6000^4.

F_spotted = [ (2 pi R² - 0.4 pi R²) * sigma 6000^4 + 0.4 pi R² sigma 5000^4 ].

So the dip is F_unspotted - F_spotted = 0.4 pi R² sigma (6000^4 - 5000^4).

The relative dip is (0.4 pi R² sigma (6000^4 -5000^4 )) / (2 pi R² sigma 6000^4) ) = (0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4)) / (2 * 6000^4).

So 0.4/2 = 0.2.

So relative dip = 0.2 * (6000^4 -5000^4) /6000^4.

Compute 6000^4 = 1296e12, 5000^4=625e12.

6000^4 -5000^4 = 671e12.

So dip = 0.2 * (671e12) / (1296e12) ) = 0.2 * (671/1296) ≈ 0.2 * 0.5176 ≈ 0.1035, or about 10.35% dip.

Wait, that's a 10% dip. Earlier calculation gave 5%, but I think I have to make sure which is correct.

Wait, in this approach, the dip is when the entire spotted hemisphere is visible. So the change in flux is 10% of the star's flux when the unspotted hemisphere is visible.

Wait, that would make the dip about 10.35% (about 10%).

So if the dip is about 10%, then the planet's radius would be sqrt(0.1) ≈ 0.316 R_star.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32, which is close.

Wait, but let's compute more accurately.

Compute (6000^4 -5000^4) / 6000^4.

6000^4 = 6^4 *10^12 = 1296e12.

5000^4 =5^4 *1e12=625e12.

Difference: 671e12.

So 671e12 /1296e12 = 671/1296 = 0.5176.

Multiply by 0.2 (from 0.4/2): 0.2 *0.5176=0.1035, about 10.35%.

So the dip is about 10.35%.

Then R_planet / R_star = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217.

Which is approximately 0.32, option D.

So the answer should be D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star, we analyze the situation as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: \( R_{\text{star}} = R_{\odot} \) (same as the Sun).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%, meaning 20% of the hemisphere's area is covered by spots.
   - Spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of \( \Delta T = 1000 \, \text{K} \), so their temperature is \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation**:
   - The star's total surface area is \( 4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \). The spotted hemisphere has an area of \( 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \), and 20% of this area is covered by spots:  
     \[
     \text{Spotted area} = 0.2 \times 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 = 0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2.
     \]
   - The fraction of the star's total surface area covered by spots is:  
     \[
     \frac{\text{Spotted area}}{\text{Total surface area}} = \frac{0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2}{4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2} = 0.1 \, (10\%).
     \]

3. **Flux Calculation**:
   - The star's total flux without spots is:  
     \[
     F_{\text{max}} = \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 = \sigma (6000)^4.
     \]
   - When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is reduced due to the cooler spots. The flux in this case is:  
     \[
     F_{\text{min}} = (1 - 0.1) \cdot \sigma (6000)^4 + 0.1 \cdot \sigma (5000)^4,
     \]
     where \( 0.1 \) is the fraction of the surface covered by spots.

   - The difference in flux between the maximum and minimum states is:  
     \[
     \Delta F = F_{\text{max}} - F_{\text{min}} = 0.1 \cdot \sigma (6000^4 - 5000^4).
     \]

4. **Relative Brightness Variation**:
   - The relative brightness variation is:  
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{max}}} = \frac{0.1 \cdot (6000^4 - 5000^4)}{6000^4}.
     \]
   - Compute \( 6000^4 = 1296 \times 10^{12} \) and \( 5000^4 = 625 \times 10^{12} \), so:  
     \[
     6000^4 - 5000^4 = 671 \times 10^{12}.
     \]
   - Substituting:  
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{max}}} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 671 \times 10^{12}}{1296 \times 10^{12}} = \frac{67.1}{1296} \approx 0.0517 \, (5.17\%).
     \]

5. **Exoplanet Radius**:
   - The brightness variation caused by a transiting exoplanet is proportional to the square of the radius ratio:  
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{max}}}.
     \]
   - Solving for \( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \):  
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.0517} \approx 0.2275.
     \]

6. **Comparison with Options**:
   - The closest option to \( 0.2275 \) is \( 0.32 \), which corresponds to **Option D**.

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet, relative to the host star, is approximately \( 0.32 \). 

Answer: D
