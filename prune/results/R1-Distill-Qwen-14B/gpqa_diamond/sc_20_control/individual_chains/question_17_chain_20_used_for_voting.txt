Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Hmm, it's about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that there's a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, and the pH is ideal at 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5×10^10. And we have four options to choose from. 

Wait, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The complex is usually written as CaY²−, where Y is the EDTA^4− ion. The K value given here is the formation constant for that complex. 

Formation constant, Kf, is the equilibrium constant for the reaction: Ca²+ + EDTA^4− ↔ CaEDTA²−. The Kf is given as 5e10, which is a pretty large number, so the complex is very stable. 

The solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex, which I think means the concentration of CaEDTA²− is 0.02 M. Now, the question is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. 

I remember that for such complexes, the concentration of the metal ion is related to the complex and the formation constant. The formula I think is Kf = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]).

But wait, in a solution where the complex is formed, the EDTA is mostly in the complex form, right? Because Kf is so large. So the free EDTA concentration is going to be really low. But wait, in this problem, the solution is just the complex—so perhaps I need to consider the dissociation of the complex into Ca²+ and EDTA^4−.

So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's assume that the complex dissociates a little bit into Ca²+ and EDTA^4−. Let me denote the concentration of Ca²+ as x. Since each complex dissociates into one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4−, the concentration of EDTA^4− would also be x. So the concentration of the complex would be approximately 0.02 - x. But since Kf is so large, x is going to be very small. So 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 M.

So plugging into the Kf expression: Kf = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]). 

Which becomes Kf = (0.02) / (x * x) = 0.02 / x².

We know Kf is 5e10, so:

5e10 = 0.02 / x².

I can solve for x²: x² = 0.02 / (5e10).

Wait, let's compute that. 0.02 is 2e-2. So x² = (2e-2)/(5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

Taking the square root of both sides, x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-12) is 1e-6. So x is 2e-6.5? Wait, wait, 4e-13 is 4 * 1e-13, so sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Hmm, wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2 because (1e-6.5)^2 = (sqrt(1e-13)) )^2. Wait, 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7 approximately. So 2e-6.5 is about 6.3e-7. Wait, wait, no, wait: 2e-6.5 is 2 times 1e-6.5. 1e-6.5 is same as 1e-6 * 1e-0.5. 1e-0.5 is about 0.316. So 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7. Therefore, 2e-6.5 is about 6.32e-7. 

But wait, let me calculate sqrt(4e-13) correctly. sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, which is approximately 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is 6.32e-7 M. 

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that's the answer. 

Wait, but let me double-check my steps. Did I make any mistakes? Oh, right, because Kf is the formation constant for the complex, which is the same as the reciprocal of the dissociation constant. So when the complex dissociates, the K for the dissociation would be 1/Kf. But in our setup, we used Kf correctly as the formation constant. So I think it's correct.

Wait, another approach: the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. The dissociation is CaEDTA²− ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4−. The K_d (dissociation constant) is 1/Kf = 2e-11. So K_d = [Ca²+][EDTA^4−] / [CaEDTA²−] = 2e-11.

So [Ca²+] = [EDTA^4−] = x. So (x^2) / 0.02 = 2e-11. So x^2 = 0.02 * 2e-11 = 4e-13. So same as before, x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5, which is about 6.3e-7 M. So yes, option C is correct.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The equilibrium reaction is:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

The formation constant is defined as:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Given that the concentration of the complex \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]\) is 0.02 M, and assuming the dissociation of the complex is negligible due to the large \( K_f \), we approximate \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}\). Let the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) ions both be \( x \). Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_f = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_f} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}}
\]

\[
x^2 = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.

Hmm, wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2 because (1e-6.5)^2 = (sqrt(1e-13)) )^2. Wait, 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7 approximately. So 2e-6.5 is about 6.3e-7. Wait, wait, no, wait: 2e-6.5 is 2 times 1e-6.5. 1e-6.5 is same as 1e-6 * 1e-0.5. 1e-0.5 is about 0.316. So 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7. Therefore, 2e-6.5 is about 6.32e-7.

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
