Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about enamine reactions. I remember that enamines are typically formed from secondary amines and carbonyl compounds, but let me think through this step by step.

The starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. Hmm, the name sounds a bit complicated. Let me break it down. The main part is ethanaminium, which is like an ammonium ion with two carbon chains attached. The substituents are N-methyl and pentan-2-ylidene. Wait, pentan-2-ylidene would be a substituted double bond at position 2 of pentane. So, the structure would be CH2=C(CH2CH2CH3)-N(CH3)(something). Wait, ethanaminium implies a positively charged amine. So perhaps the structure is [CH2=C(CH2CH2CH3)-N(CH3)2]+?

Wait, no, wait. Ethanaminium would be CH3NH3+ or similar? No, wait, ethanaminium is like CH2CH2NH3+? I'm a bit confused. Let me think. Maybe it's CH2=CH group attached to the N. Wait, the compound is N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So the ethanaminium is the base structure. So ethanaminium would be CH3CH2NH3+? No, wait, ethanamine is CH2CH3NH2. So ethanaminium would be CH2CH3NH3+. But in this case, the N has two substituents: a methyl group and a pentan-2-ylidene group.

Wait, pentan-2-ylidene is CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond starting at C2. So structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3? No, pentan-2-ylidene would be CH2CH2 with a double bond. Wait, pentan-2-ylidene would be CH2-C(=CH2)-CH2CH2CH3? Hmm, maybe I'm not getting this right. Let's think about IUPAC nomenclature. Pentan-2-ylidene would have the structure CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but wait, that's just pentyl. Oh wait, no. The ylidene indicates a double bond. So pentan-2-ylidene would be a substituent where the ylidene group is attached at position 2. So it's CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, the ylidene is a substituent, so it's a substituent on a main chain. Wait, maybe it's a substituent on another structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an enamine already. Enamines are usually formed from a secondary amine and a ketone or aldehyde. Enamines have the structure R2N-CH2-CR', where the R groups are from the amine, and the CR' is from the carbonyl.

Wait, but the starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So ethanaminium implies two carbons attached to the amine. So the structure might be CH2=C(CH2CH2CH3)-N(CH3)(something). Wait, but it's an ammonium ion. So perhaps it's a protonated amine. Like, the amine is positively charged.

So the structure could be [CH2=C(CH2CH2CH3)-N(CH3)2]+. So that's an enamine with a positive charge. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps that's the structure.

Now, the reaction is with reagent A. The product B is either some ketone plus another amine or another compound.

Looking at the options, option C and D say B is heptan-4-one, and options A and B say B is pentan-2-one plus dimethylamine. So I need to figure out what the product is.

Enamine reactions can be used in various ways. One common use is in the formation of ketones via hydrolysis. Enamines when hydrolyzed can yield ketones or aldehydes, depending on the starting material.

Wait, another possibility: the enamine might be undergoing some kind of alkylation or other reaction. But the reagents in the options involve LDA, DME (which is 1,2-dimethoxyethane, a solvent), and CH3CH2I.

Wait, so the reagents in the options are sequences. For example, option A: (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+.

But wait, the question says A is the reagent, but the reaction is enamine plus A to give B. Wait, no, reaction (B) is the product, and the question says to select the correct sequence of reagents (A) according to the reaction steps.

Wait, the reaction is written as: (E)-... + A ---> B.

But the options for the reagents are given. So each option (A, B, C, D) provides a sequence of reagents (A) and the product (B). So we have to choose which option correctly gives the product B when the starting material is treated with reagents A.

Hmm.

Wait, Enamine reactions typically involve forming the enamine, then using it in a reaction (like a Michael addition or alkylation), followed by hydrolysis to get the ketone.

But looking at the starting material, if it's an enamine already, perhaps it's the result of a previous enamine formation. Maybe the starting material is the enamine, and the reaction is something else.

Wait, let me think about the reagents. LDA is a strong base, usually used to deprotonate compounds. DME is a solvent. CH3CH2I is ethyl iodide, which is an alkylating agent.

So perhaps the reaction sequence is:

1. Treatment with LDA (a strong base) in DME. LDA would deprotonate something. But the starting material is an enamine, which is positively charged. Hmm, maybe deprotonating another site.

Wait, the starting material is an enamine and has a positive charge. So perhaps the LDA would deprotonate a beta hydrogen, making a strong base.

Wait, the enamine structure is R2NC=CR', where R and R' are substituents. The beta protons are on the carbons adjacent to the double bond. Deprotonating with a strong base like LDA would abstract a beta hydrogen, forming an enolate-like structure.

Alternatively, maybe the enamine is deprotonated to form an enolate, which could then react with an alkyl halide.

So step (i): LDA (in DME) deprotonates the enamine to form an enolate.

Step (ii): reacts with CH3CH2I. That's an alkylation. The enolate would attack the ethyl iodide, adding an ethyl group.

Step (iii): H3O+ workup. This would protonate the enolate, and then hydrolysis would occur. Since the enamine was formed from a ketone, hydrolysis would break it back into the ketone and amine.

Wait, but what's the overall process? If the starting material is an enamine, and you alkylate it, then upon hydrolysis, you'd get a new ketone.

Let me think about the starting enamine. The enamine is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So the structure is [CH2=C(CH2CH2CH3)-N(CH3)2]+. When we deprotonate it, perhaps at the CH2 group next to the double bond.

After deprotonation, we have an enolate, which can attack ethyl iodide. So the ethyl group would add to the alpha position (the carbon adjacent to the enamine's nitrogen).

Wait, but the enamine is R2N-CR2, so after deprotonation, the attack would occur on the same carbon as the double bond. Once the ethyl group is added, the structure would have an additional ethyl substituent.

Then, upon protonation and hydrolysis, the enamine would break down. The enamine is formed from a ketone and a secondary amine. So when you hydrolyze an enamine, you get the ketone back and the amine.

Wait, but in this scenario, the starting enamine is already formed, so perhaps this reaction is a way to modify the enamine before hydrolysis.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction sequence is a way to alkylate the enamine, which upon hydrolysis would give a new ketone with an additional substituent.

So let's model this.

Original enamine: [CH2=C(CH2CH2CH3)-N(CH3)2]+. Upon deprotonation, perhaps the CH2 becomes a carbanion, which attacks ethyl iodide, adding an ethyl group. So the structure becomes [CH2+Et-C(CH2CH2CH3)-N(CH3)2]- then after workup, maybe.

Wait, perhaps the process is:

1. LDA deprotonates the enamine to form a strong base.

2. The enolate attacks ethyl iodide, adding an ethyl group.

3. Then, upon acid workup (H3O+), the enamine is protonated, and then hydrolyzed.

Hydrolysis of the enamine would break it into a ketone and the amine.

Wait, but what's the starting enamine made from? Enamines are typically formed from a ketone and a secondary amine. So if the starting enamine is from pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethyl ethanamine, then hydrolysis would give pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine.

But wait, in the reaction, after alkylation, the enamine would have a larger substituent. So when you hydrolyze, you would get a larger ketone.

Wait, let's think about the structures.

The starting enamine is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So the enamine is derived from a secondary amine (N,N-dimethyl ethanamine, perhaps) and pentan-2-one.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The enamine is formed from a secondary amine and a ketone. The general structure is R2N-CH2-COR', where R and R' come from the amine and ketone, respectively.

Wait, perhaps the enamine in the starting material is formed from N,N-dimethylethanamine and pentan-2-one. So the enamine would have the structure CH2C(COR')(N(CH3)2), where COR' is from the ketone.

Wait, pentan-2-one is (CH3)COCH2CH2CH3. So the enamine would be CH2C(COCH2CH2CH3)(N(CH3)2).

But in this case, the starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So perhaps the enamine is [CH2=C(CH2CH2CH3)-N(CH3)2]+. That would imply that the enamine is formed from a secondary amine (N,N-dimethyl ethanamine) and a carbonyl group from pentan-2-one.

But wait, pentan-2-one is (CH3)COCH2CH2CH3. Its enamine would involve the amine attacking the carbonyl to form R2N-CH2-CO-R', but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is the enamine, and the reaction is a way to add an ethyl group via alkylation.

So, after deprotonation with LDA, the enamine would form a strong base, which attacks ethyl iodide. Then, upon acid workup, the structure would have an ethyl group added.

Wait, but adding to where? The enamine has a double bond. So perhaps the ethyl group adds to the alpha position, which is next to the double bond.

So after alkylation, the enamine would have an ethyl group added. Then, upon hydrolysis, the enamine would break down into a ketone and the amine.

But wait, the original enamine is from pentan-2-one. If we add an ethyl group, would the new ketone be longer?

Wait, let's think about the process step by step.

Original enamine: formed from pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine.

Structure of pentan-2-one: (CH2)2COCH2CH3. Enamine formation would typically involve the amine attacking the carbonyl, then elimination of water to form the enamine.

Wait, but the initial enamine here seems to be [CH2=C(CH2CH2CH3)-N(CH3)2]+. So the enamine has a double bond between C1 and C2, with substituents on C2 being (CH2CH2CH3) and the amine.

So, perhaps the enamine is derived from cyclohexanone, but wait, no. Let me not get stuck here.

The reaction steps are:

1. LDA in DME (step i)
2. CH3CH2I (step ii)
3. H3O+ (step iii)

So, the sequence is deprotonation with LDA, alkylation, then acid workup.

So, LDA is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It would abstract a proton from the enamine. The enamine has a structure where the double bond is conjugated to the N. So the enamine's structure is something like R2N-CR2=CH2.

Wait, maybe the enamine is [CH2=C(R)-N(CH3)2]+. So the structure is a cyclopropane? No, probably a more extended chain.

When LDA deprotonates the enamine, it abstracts a beta hydrogen, forming an enolate-like species. This enolate can then attack an electrophile, like ethyl iodide.

So the enolate would attack ethyl iodide, adding an ethyl group to the carbon adjacent to the double bond.

Upon workup with acid (H3O+), the enamine would be protonated, and then hydrolyzed back into the ketone and amine.

Wait, but what's the overall effect? Let's model it.

Original enamine: [CH2=C(R)-N(CH3)2]+, where R is pentyl group.

After deprotonation and alkylation, the structure becomes [CH2-C(-OEt)-C(R)-N(CH3)2]+? No, perhaps I'm not getting this right.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkylation adds an ethyl group to the carbon adjacent to the double bond.

Let me imagine the enamine as:

N(CH3)2-C=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3 (but I'm not sure about the substituents). So when LDA deprotonates the CH2 group next to the double bond, the enolate forms. Then, the enolate attacks ethyl iodide, adding an ethyl group to that carbon.

So after alkylation, the structure would have an ethyl group added, making a longer chain.

Then, upon hydrolysis, the enamine would break into a ketone and the amine. But where would the new ethyl group go?

Wait, perhaps the initial enamine is derived from a ketone. So when we add ethyl to the enamine, the ketone part after hydrolysis would have an additional ethyl substituent.

Wait, perhaps the starting enamine is from pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine. So the starting enamine is [CH2=C(CH2CH2CH3)-N(CH3)2]+.

After alkylation with ethyl iodide, the structure becomes [CH2-C(Et)(CH2CH2CH3)-N(CH3)2]+.

Upon hydrolysis, this would break into a ketone and the amine. The ketone part would be where the enamine was connected. The new substituent (Et) would come from the alkylation.

Wait, but hydrolysis of an enamine typically yields the ketone. So the new substituent (Et) would probably be adjacent to the ketone.

Wait, let me think about the structure. The enamine is R2N-CH2-C(R')2.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

N(CH3)2-CH2-C(=CH2-CH2CH2CH3).

No, I'm not getting this clearly. Let me perhaps draw it out in my mind.

Alternatively, perhaps the enamine has a structure where the nitrogen is attached to a CH2 group, which is part of a double bond. So it's something like N(CH3)2-CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)=CH2?

No, not sure. Maybe it's better to think about the starting enamine as derived from pentan-2-one and the amine.

Pentan-2-one is (CH3)COCH2CH2CH3. The enamine would form when the amine (N,N-dimethylethanamine) attacks the carbonyl, eliminating water, and forming a double bond. So the enamine structure would be CH2=C(O-)N(CH3)2-CH2CH2CH3. But that doesn't sound right.

Alternatively, the enamine would be something like CH2=CH-N(CH3)2-CO-R, but I'm getting stuck.

Maybe I should instead think about the reagent sequences.

Looking at the options:

Option C: A is (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+. Product B is heptan-4-one.

So, the product is a ketone, heptan-4-one. Heptan-4-one is CH2CH2COCH2CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, heptan-4-one is (CH2)3-CO-(CH2)2CH3? Or wait, positions are 1 to 7 carbons, with the ketone on C4. So structure is CH2CH2CH2COCH2CH2CH3.

If the product is heptan-4-one, that would imply that the enamine after reaction has 7 carbons, and upon hydrolysis, the ketone is heptan-4-one.

The starting material's enamine is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. Let's count the carbons.

Pentan-2-ylidene is a substituent with 5 carbons, I think. The ethanaminium part is two carbons. So the enamine has 5 + 2 =7 carbons?

Wait, maybe not. The pentan-2-ylidene substituent would be a five-carbon group with the double bond at position 2. So the double bond is between C2 and C3 of a five-carbon chain. So the substituent is -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, the substituent is the pentan-2-ylidene group, which is -CH2-CH=CH-CH2-CH3? Or perhaps it's a propyl group with a double bond.

I'm not getting this clearly, but perhaps the enamine, after being alkylated, upon hydrolysis, gives a ketone with more carbons.

If the starting enamine is derived from a five-carbon ketone (pentan-2-one) and the amine, then adding an ethyl group would give a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the starting enamine's formation is from pentan-2-one and the amine, so upon hydrolysis, the product would be pentan-2-one and the amine.

But in the reaction, after alkylation, the enamine would have an ethyl group added somewhere, leading upon hydrolysis to a different ketone.

If the starting enamine is from pentan-2-one, and after alkylation, the ketone becomes heptan-4-one, that would make sense.

Wait, let me think: starting with pentan-2-one (5 carbons), and adding an ethyl group in the enamine, which upon hydrolysis would give a longer chain.

Wait, pentan-2-one is (CH3)COCH2CH2CH3. So if we add ethyl to the enamine (say, at position alpha), upon hydrolysis, the ketone would have another carbon.

Wait, perhaps the initial enamine is from pentan-2-one and the amine. Then, the enamine is treated with LDA to deprotonate, then ethyl iodide adds an ethyl group. Upon hydrolysis, the new ketone would have an additional ethyl group, making it heptan-4-one.

Wait, but let me count the carbons.

Original enamine: derived from pentan-2-one (5 carbons) and the amine (which is part of the enamine structure). So the enamine is perhaps 5 + 2 =7 carbons.

Wait, the ethyl iodide adds an ethyl group, making the enamine longer. When hydrolyzed, the ketone would have 7 carbons, perhaps.

So, heptan-4-one would be CH2CH2CH2COCH2CH2CH3. But wait, heptan-4-one is (CH2)3-CO-(CH2)2CH3.

If the starting material is pentan-2-one, adding an ethyl group would make the ketone longer.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting enamine is from a different starting ketone. But I think I'm getting tangled here.

Looking at option C: the product is heptan-4-one.

Option D's product is heptan-4-one as well, but the reagents are different.

Wait, let me look at the options again:

Option C: A is (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+. B is heptan-4-one.

Option D: A is (i) LDA; (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+. B is heptan-4-one.

Wait, the reagent sequences differ in whether DME is part of the first step or the second.

LDA is often used in THF or DME as a solvent. So step (i) in option C is LDA, DME. Step (ii) is ethyl iodide, then step (iii) H3O+.

Option D's step (i) is LDA, then step (ii) is DME, ethyl iodide, H3O+.

Hmm, that doesn't make much sense. Typically, LDA is used in a solvent like THF or DME. So the first step (i) would be adding LDA to the solvent. So option C's step (i) is correct.

So, if the product is heptan-4-one, that would require the enamine to have a longer chain, implying addition of ethyl.

So, the reaction steps would be:

1. Deprotonate with LDA in DME.

2. Alkylation with ethyl iodide.

3. Acid workup.

Upon hydrolysis, the enamine would break into the ketone.

So, putting it all together, the product B would be heptan-4-one, and the reagent sequence is as in option C.

Looking back, the options:

Option C: Reagents (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+. Product B is heptan-4-one.

Option D: Reagents (i) LDA; (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+. Product B is heptan-4-one.

So which option is correct?

I think the sequence in option C is correct because step (i) would be adding LDA in DME. Then, step (ii) would be adding ethyl iodide, followed by H3O+.

Therefore, the correct answer would be option C, where the product is heptan-4-one and the reagents are in that order.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves an enamine, (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium, undergoing a sequence of reagents to produce a product (B). The enamine is a positively charged species with a structure likely derived from a secondary amine and a carbonyl compound. The reagents provided in the options include LDA (a strong base), DME (a solvent), CH3CH2I (an alkylating agent), and H3O+ (for protonation and hydrolysis).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Reagent Sequence**:
   - **Option C**: 
     - Step (i): LDA in DME deprotonates the enamine, forming an enolate.
     - Step (ii): CH3CH2I alkylates the enolate, adding an ethyl group.
     - Step (iii): H3O+ protonates and hydrolyzes the enamine, yielding a ketone.
   - **Option D**:
     - Step (i): LDA is used without a solvent, which is inconsistent with typical LDA usage.
     - Step (ii): DME, CH3CH2I, and H3O+ are used together, which is less logical as LDA typically requires a solvent like DME.

2. **Product Analysis**:
   - The starting enamine is derived from a secondary amine and a ketone. Upon hydrolysis, enamines typically break down into a ketone and the corresponding amine.
   - The addition of an ethyl group during the reaction increases the carbon chain length. This leads to the formation of heptan-4-one (a seven-carbon ketone with the carbonyl group at position 4) as the final product.

3. **Correct Sequence**:
   - Option C provides a logical sequence: LDA in DME deprotonates the enamine, CH3CH2I alkylates it, and H3O+ hydrolyzes it to yield heptan-4-one.
   - Option D’s sequence is less plausible due to the improper use of LDA without a solvent and the combined use of reagents in step (ii).

### Conclusion:
The correct sequence of reagents is provided in **Option C**, leading to the product heptan-4-one.

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about enamine reactions. I remember that enamines are typically formed from secondary amines and carbonyl compounds, but let me think through this step by step.

Wait, no, wait. Ethanaminium would be CH3NH3+ or similar? No, wait, ethanaminium is like CH2CH2NH3+? I'm a bit confused. Let me think. Maybe it's CH2=CH group attached to the N. Wait, the compound is N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So the ethanaminium is the base structure. So ethanaminium would be CH3CH2NH3+? No, wait, ethanamine is CH2CH3NH2. So ethanaminium would be CH2CH3NH3+. But in this case, the N has two substituents: a methyl group and a pentan-2-ylidene group.

Wait, pentan-2-ylidene is CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond starting at C2. So structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3? No, pentan-2-ylidene would be CH2CH2 with a double bond.

Wait, the reaction is written as: (E)-... + A ---> B.

But the options for the reagents are given. So each option (A, B, C, D) provides a sequence of reagents (A) and the product (B). So we have to choose which option correctly gives the product B when the starting material is treated with reagents A.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the process is:

1. LDA deprotonates the enamine to form a strong base.

2. The enolate attacks ethyl iodide, adding an ethyl group.

3. Then, upon acid workup (H3O+), the enamine is protonated, and then hydrolyzed.

Hydrolysis of the enamine would break it into a ketone and the amine.

Wait, but what's the starting enamine made from? Enamines are typically formed from a ketone and a secondary amine. So if the starting enamine is from pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethyl ethanamine, then hydrolysis would give pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine.

But wait, in the reaction, after alkylation, the enamine would have a larger substituent. So when you hydrolyze, you would get a larger ketone.

Wait, let's think about the structures.

The starting enamine is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So the enamine is derived from a secondary amine (N,N-dimethyl ethanamine, perhaps) and pentan-2-one.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The enamine is formed from a secondary amine and a ketone. The general structure is R2N-CH2-COR', where R and R' come from the amine and ketone, respectively.

Wait, perhaps the enamine in the starting material is formed from N,N-dimethylethanamine and pentan-2-one. So the enamine would have the structure CH2C(COR')(N(CH3)2), where COR' is from the ketone.

Wait, pentan-2-one is (CH3)COCH2CH2CH3. So the enamine would be CH2C(COCH2CH2CH3)(N(CH3)2).

But in this case, the starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So perhaps the enamine is [CH2=C(CH2CH2CH3)-N(CH3)2]+. That would imply that the enamine is formed from a secondary amine (N,N-dimethyl ethanamine) and a carbonyl group from pentan-2-one.

But wait, pentan-2-one is (CH3)COCH2CH2CH3. Its enamine would involve the amine attacking the carbonyl to form R2N-CH2-CO-R', but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is the enamine, and the reaction is a way to add an ethyl group via alkylation.

So, after deprotonation with LDA, the enamine would form a strong base, which attacks ethyl iodide. Then, upon acid workup, the structure would have an ethyl group added.

Wait, but adding to where? The enamine has a double bond. So perhaps the ethyl group adds to the alpha position, which is next to the double bond.

So after alkylation, the enamine would have an ethyl group added. Then, upon hydrolysis, the enamine would break down into a ketone and the amine.

But wait, the original enamine is from pentan-2-one. If we add an ethyl group, would the new ketone be longer?

Wait, let's think about the process step by step.

Original enamine: formed from pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine.

Structure of pentan-2-one: (CH2)2COCH2CH3. Enamine formation would typically involve the amine attacking the carbonyl, then elimination of water to form the enamine.

Wait, but the initial enamine here seems to be [CH2=C(CH2CH2CH3)-N(CH3)2]+. So the enamine has a double bond between C1 and C2, with substituents on C2 being (CH2CH2CH3) and the amine.

So, perhaps the enamine is derived from cyclohexanone, but wait, no. Let me not get stuck here.

The reaction steps are:

1. LDA in DME (step i)
2. CH3CH2I (step ii)
3. H3O+ (step iii)

So, the sequence is deprotonation with LDA, alkylation, then acid workup.

So, LDA is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It would abstract a proton from the enamine. The enamine has a structure where the double bond is conjugated to the N. So the enamine's structure is something like R2N-CR2=CH2.

Wait, maybe the enamine is [CH2=C(R)-N(CH3)2]+. So the structure is a cyclopropane? No, probably a more extended chain.

When LDA deprotonates the enamine, it abstracts a beta hydrogen, forming an enolate-like species. This enolate can then attack an electrophile, like ethyl iodide.

So the enolate would attack ethyl iodide, adding an ethyl group to the carbon adjacent to the double bond.

Upon workup with acid (H3O+), the enamine would be protonated, and then hydrolyzed back into the ketone and amine.

Wait, but what's the overall effect? Let's model it.

Original enamine: [CH2=C(R)-N(CH3)2]+, where R is pentyl group.

After deprotonation and alkylation, the structure becomes [CH2-C(-OEt)-C(R)-N(CH3)2]+? No, perhaps I'm not getting this right.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkylation adds an ethyl group to the carbon adjacent to the double bond.

Let me imagine the enamine as:

N(CH3)2-C=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3 (but I'm not sure about the substituents). So when LDA deprotonates the CH2 group next to the double bond, the enolate forms. Then, the enolate attacks ethyl iodide, adding an ethyl group to that carbon.

So after alkylation, the structure would have an ethyl group added, making a longer chain.

Then, upon hydrolysis, the enamine would break into a ketone and the amine. But where would the new ethyl group go?

Wait, perhaps the initial enamine is derived from a ketone. So when we add ethyl to the enamine, the ketone part after hydrolysis would have an additional ethyl substituent.

Wait, perhaps the starting enamine is from pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine. So the starting enamine is [CH2=C(CH2CH2CH3)-N(CH3)2]+.

After alkylation with ethyl iodide, the structure becomes [CH2-C(Et)(CH2CH2CH3)-N(CH3)2]+.

Upon hydrolysis, this would break into a ketone and the amine. The ketone part would be where the enamine was connected. The new substituent (Et) would come from the alkylation.

Wait, but hydrolysis of an enamine typically yields the ketone. So the new substituent (Et) would probably be adjacent to the ketone.

Wait, let me think about the structure. The enamine is R2N-CH2-C(R')2.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

N(CH3)2-CH2-C(=CH2-CH2CH2CH3).

No, I'm not getting this clearly. Let me perhaps draw it out in my mind.

Alternatively, perhaps the enamine has a structure where the nitrogen is attached to a CH2 group, which is part of a double bond. So it's something like N(CH3)2-CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)=CH2?

No, not sure. Maybe it's better to think about the starting enamine as derived from pentan-2-one and the amine.

Pentan-2-one is (CH3)COCH2CH2CH3. The enamine would form when the amine (N,N-dimethylethanamine) attacks the carbonyl, eliminating water, and forming a double bond. So the enamine structure would be CH2=C(O-)N(CH3)2-CH2CH2CH3. But that doesn't sound right.

Alternatively, the enamine would be something like CH2=CH-N(CH3)2-CO-R, but I'm getting stuck.

Maybe I should instead think about the reagent sequences.

Looking at the options:

Option C: A is (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+. Product B is heptan-4-one.

So, the product is a ketone, heptan-4-one. Heptan-4-one is CH2CH2COCH2CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, heptan-4-one is (CH2)3-CO-(CH2)2CH3? Or wait, positions are 1 to 7 carbons, with the ketone on C4. So structure is CH2CH2CH2COCH2CH2CH3.

If the product is heptan-4-one, that would imply that the enamine after reaction has 7 carbons, and upon hydrolysis, the ketone is heptan-4-one.

The starting material's enamine is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. Let's count the carbons.

Pentan-2-ylidene is a substituent with 5 carbons, I think. The ethanaminium part is two carbons. So the enamine has 5 + 2 =7 carbons?

Wait, maybe not. The pentan-2-ylidene substituent would be a five-carbon group with the double bond at position 2. So the double bond is between C2 and C3 of a five-carbon chain. So the substituent is -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, the substituent is the pentan-2-ylidene group, which is -CH2-CH=CH-CH2-CH3? Or perhaps it's a propyl group with a double bond.

I'm not getting this clearly, but perhaps the enamine, after being alkylated, upon hydrolysis, gives a ketone with more carbons.

If the starting enamine is derived from a five-carbon ketone (pentan-2-one) and the amine, then adding an ethyl group would give a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the starting enamine's formation is from pentan-2-one and the amine, so upon hydrolysis, the product would be pentan-2-one and the amine.

But in the reaction, after alkylation, the enamine would have an ethyl group added somewhere, leading upon hydrolysis to a different ketone.

If the starting enamine is from pentan-2-one, and after alkylation, the ketone becomes heptan-4-one, that would make sense.

Wait, let me think: starting with pentan-2-one (5 carbons), and adding an ethyl group in the enamine, which upon hydrolysis would give a longer chain.

Wait, pentan-2-one is (CH3)COCH2CH2CH3. So if we add ethyl to the enamine (say, at position alpha), upon hydrolysis, the ketone would have another carbon.

Wait, perhaps the initial enamine is from pentan-2-one and the amine. Then, the enamine is treated with LDA to deprotonate, then ethyl iodide adds an ethyl group. Upon hydrolysis, the new ketone would have an additional ethyl group, making it heptan-4-one.

Wait, but let me count the carbons.

Original enamine: derived from pentan-2-one (5 carbons) and the amine (which is part of the enamine structure). So the enamine is perhaps 5 + 2 =7 carbons.

Wait, the ethyl iodide adds an ethyl group, making the enamine longer. When hydrolyzed, the ketone would have 7 carbons, perhaps.

So, heptan-4-one would be CH2CH2CH2COCH2CH2CH3. But wait, heptan-4-one is (CH2)3-CO-(CH2)2CH3.

If the starting material is pentan-2-one, adding an ethyl group would make the ketone longer.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting enamine is from a different starting ketone. But I think I'm getting tangled here.

Looking at option C: the product is heptan-4-one.

Option D's product is heptan-4-one as well, but the reagents are different.

Wait, let me look at the options again:

Option C: A is (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+. B is heptan-4-one.

Option D: A is (i) LDA; (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+. B is heptan-4-one.

Wait, the reagent sequences differ in whether DME is part of the first step or the second.

LDA is often used in THF or DME as a solvent. So step (i) in option C is LDA, DME. Step (ii) is ethyl iodide, then step (iii) H3O+.

Option D's step (i) is LDA, then step (ii) is DME, ethyl iodide, H3O+.

Hmm, that doesn't make much sense. Typically, LDA is used in a solvent like THF or DME. So the first step (i) would be adding LDA to the solvent. So option C's step (i) is correct.

So, if the product is heptan-4-one, that would require the enamine to have a longer chain, implying addition of ethyl.

So, the reaction steps would be:

1. Deprotonate with LDA in DME.

2. Alkylation with ethyl iodide.

3. Acid workup.

Upon hydrolysis, the enamine would break into the ketone.

So, putting it all together, the product B would be heptan-4-one, and the reagent sequence is as in option C.

Looking back, the options:

Option C: Reagents (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+. Product B is heptan-4-one.

Option D: Reagents (i) LDA; (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+. Product B is heptan-4-one.

So which option is correct?

I think the sequence in option C is correct because step (i) would be adding LDA in DME. Then, step (ii) would be adding ethyl iodide, followed by H3O+.

Therefore, the correct answer would be option C, where the product is heptan-4-one and the reagents are in that order.


The reaction involves an enamine, (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium, undergoing a sequence of reagents to produce a product (B). The enamine is a positively charged species with a structure likely derived from a secondary amine and a carbonyl compound. The reagents provided in the options include LDA (a strong base), DME (a solvent), CH3CH2I (an alkylating agent), and H3O+ (for protonation and hydrolysis).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Reagent Sequence**:
   - **Option C**: 
     - Step (i): LDA in DME deprotonates the enamine, forming an enolate.
     - Step (ii): CH3CH2I alkylates the enolate, adding an ethyl group.
     - Step (iii): H3O+ protonates and hydrolyzes the enamine, yielding a ketone.
   - **Option D**:
     - Step (i): LDA is used without a solvent, which is inconsistent with typical LDA usage.
     - Step (ii): DME, CH3CH2I, and H3O+ are used together, which is less logical as LDA typically requires a solvent like DME.

2. **Product Analysis**:
   - The starting enamine is derived from a secondary amine and a ketone. Upon hydrolysis, enamines typically break down into a ketone and the corresponding amine.
   - The addition of an ethyl group during the reaction increases the carbon chain length. This leads to the formation of heptan-4-one (a seven-carbon ketone with the carbonyl group at position 4) as the final product.

3. **Correct Sequence**:
   - Option C provides a logical sequence: LDA in DME deprotonates the enamine, CH3CH2I alkylates it, and H3O+ hydrolyzes it to yield heptan-4-one.
   - Option D’s sequence is less plausible due to the improper use of LDA without a solvent and the combined use of reagents in step (ii).

### Conclusion:
The correct sequence of reagents is provided in **Option C**, leading to the product heptan-4-one.

**Answer: C**
