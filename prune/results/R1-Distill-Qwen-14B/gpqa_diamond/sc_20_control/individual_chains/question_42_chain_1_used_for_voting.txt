Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, there are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They have circular orbits and were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variation. But I'm not too familiar with that, so maybe I'll ignore that detail for now.

The problem gives me some ratios. The equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 are about 1.4. Between Planet2 and Planet3, it's about 2.3. Also, the masses have ratios: Planet1 to Planet2 is 1.15, and Planet2 to Planet3 is 1.35. They want to find by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1's. All have the same albedo, 0.3, like Earth.

Hmm. I remember that equilibrium temperature relates to the distance from the star and the star's luminosity. The formula I think is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.25 )^(−1/2), wait, maybe I should get the exact formula right.

Wait, the equilibrium temperature formula is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.25. Or is it the other way around? No, wait, I think the formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.25 )^(-1/2)... Wait, maybe I'm mixing this up. Let me think again.

The equilibrium temperature for a planet is given by the formula:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.25

Wait, no, maybe the formula is T_eq = T_star * ( R_star / (2a) )^0.5 * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.25. So it's proportional to sqrt(R/(2a)) multiplied by the square root of (1 - albedo), but wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: The equilibrium temperature equation is based on the balance between the incoming stellar flux and the outgoing thermal radiation. The incoming flux is F = L_star/(4πa²), where L is the star's luminosity and a is the planet's orbital distance. The planet radiates as a blackbody, with F_out = σT_eq^4, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

Setting F = F_out, we get L/(4πa²) = σ T_eq^4 (1 - albedo) / (4π). Wait, because the planet reflects some light (albedo is the fraction reflected), so the absorbed flux is (1 - albedo) times the incident flux.

So, L/(4πa²) * (1 - albedo) = σ T_eq^4 / (4π).

Wait, perhaps simplifying:

L * (1 - albedo) / (4πa²) = σ T_eq^4 / (4π)

Multiply both sides by 4π:

L (1 - albedo) / a² = 4π σ T_eq^4

So, T_eq^4 = L (1 - albedo) / (4 π σ a² )

Taking the fourth root:

T_eq = [ L (1 - albedo) / (4 π σ a² ) ]^(1/4)

We can rearrange this as:

T_eq = [ L / (4 π σ) ]^(1/4) * [ (1 - albedo) / a² ]^(1/4 )

But L/(4πσ) is (L/(4πσ)) = (T_star^4 R_star^2 σ )/(4πσ) )? Wait, no, wait. Because L is the star's luminosity, and L = 4π R_star^2 σ T_star^4.

Because L is the power radiated by the star, which is a blackbody: L = 4 π R_star^2 σ T_star^4.

So substituting that into the T_eq equation:

T_eq = [ (4 π R_star^2 σ T_star^4) * (1 - albedo) ) / (4 π σ a²) ) ]^(1/4 )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

4 π cancels, σ cancels, so we have ( R_star^2 T_star^4 (1 - albedo) ) / a² ) )^(1/4 )

Which is [ R_star^2 * T_star^4 * (1-albedo) ]^(1/4 ) / a^(1/2 )

Wait, because (a²) in the denominator is a^2, so when you take the 1/4 power, it's a^(2*(1/4))=a^(1/2). So,

T_eq = T_star * R_star^(1/2) * (1 - albedo)^(1/4) / a^(1/2) )

Wait, because T_star^4 to the 1/4 is T_star^(1), R_star squared to the 1/4 is R_star^(1/2), and (1-albedo) to the 1/4 is as is. a squared to the 1/4 is a^(1/2).

Wait, no, wait. Let's see: the denominator is a^2, so when you take the fraction, the a is in the denominator. So, it's:

[ R_star^2 * T_star^4 * (1-albedo) ) ]^(1/4) / a^(1/2 )

Which is:

R_star^(2*(1/4)) * T_star^(4*(1/4)) * (1-albedo)^(1/4) ) / a^(1/2 )

Which is:

R_star^(0.5) * T_star^1 * (1-albedo)^0.25 / a^(0.5)

Which can be written as:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / a ) * (1 - albedo)^0.25

Wait, wait, that doesn't seem right. Because sqrt(R/a) is R^(0.5)/ a^0.5. So, T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(a)) ) * (1 - albedo)^0.25.

Wait, but in the previous step, I think I made a mistake. Let me redo the substitution.

We have:

L = 4 π R_star² σ T_star⁴

So substituting into T_eq:

T_eq^4 = [ L (1 - albedo) ] / (4 π σ a² )

= [4 π R_star² σ T_star^4 (1 - albedo) ] / (4 π σ a^2 )

The 4 π and σ cancel, leaving R_star² T_star^4 (1 - albedo) / a².

So,

T_eq^4 = (R_star² T_star^4 (1 - albedo)) / a²

Taking the fourth root,

T_eq = T_star * (R_star / a )^(1/2) * (1 - albedo)^(1/4)

Which can be written as:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(a)) * (1 - albedo)^(1/4)

Wait, but wait, since (R_star² / a² ) is (R_star/a)^2, so taking square root gives R_star/a.

Wait, no, let's see:

(R_star² / a²) is (R_star/a)^2, so (R_star/a)^2 to the 1/4 is (R_star/a)^(0.5), which is sqrt(R_star/a).

So,

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(a) ) * (1 - albedo)^(1/4)

Wait, but that can't be right because the a is in the denominator, so when you have sqrt(R/a), that's the same as R^0.5 / a^0.5.

Wait, perhaps I should reorganize this. Because if I write T_eq as proportional to sqrt( R/(a) ), then the temperature would increase with the square root of the star's radius and decrease with the square root of the planet's orbital distance.

But maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key point is that the equilibrium temperature depends on the star's temperature, the star's radius, the planet's distance, and the albedo.

But in this problem, all three planets orbit the same star, so T_star and R_star are the same for all. The albedo is given as 0.3 for all, so (1 - albedo) is 0.7 for all. So those factors are constants across all three planets.

So, for each planet, T_eq is proportional to sqrt( R_star / a ) * (1 - albedo)^(1/4 )

But since R_star and (1 - albedo) are the same for all, the ratio of T_eq between two planets depends only on the square root of (R_star/a) ratio.

Wait, but since R_star is the same for all, T_eq is proportional to 1/sqrt(a), because sqrt(R/a) is sqrt(R) / sqrt(a). So, if R is fixed, then sqrt(R) is a constant, so T_eq is proportional to 1/sqrt(a).

So, the equilibrium temperature inversely depends on the square root of the orbital distance. So, T_eq ∝ 1 / sqrt(a).

So, for Planet1 and Planet2, the ratio T1/T2 is given as 1.4.

Wait, no, wait. The problem says the ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.4. So T1 / T2 ≈ 1.4.

But since T_eq is inversely proportional to sqrt(a), so:

T1 / T2 = (a2 / a1 )^0.5

Because if a1 < a2, then T1 > T2.

Wait, wait, let me write the ratio:

T1 / T2 = (a2 / a1 )^0.5 ?

No, because T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a), so T1 / T2 = (a2 / a1 )^(-0.5) ) = (a1 / a2 )^0.5.

Because T1 = k / sqrt(a1), T2 =k / sqrt(a2). So T1 / T2 = sqrt(a2/a1).

Yes, because sqrt(a2/a1) is the same as (a2/a1)^(1/2).

So, T1 / T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) = 1.4.

So, a2/a1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96.

So, a2 = 1.96 a1.

Similarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3. So T2 / T3 = 2.3.

Again, T2 / T3 = sqrt( a3 / a2 )

So, sqrt(a3 / a2 ) = 2.3 → a3/a2 = (2.3)^2 = approx 5.29.

So, a3 = 5.29 a2.

Now, but I have a2 in terms of a1. a2 = 1.96 a1.

So, substituting, a3 = 5.29 * 1.96 a1.

Let me calculate that. 5.29 * 1.96.

Well, 5 * 1.96 is 9.8, 0.29 *1.96 is about 0.5684. So total is approx 10.3684.

So, a3 ≈ 10.3684 a1.

So, the distance of Planet3 is about 10.368 times that of Planet1.

But the question is about the orbital period. So, I need to find the ratio of the orbital periods P3/P1.

I recall Kepler's third law: (P^2)/(a^3) is proportional to 1/(M*), where M* is the mass of the star. But wait, the planets are orbiting the same star, so M* is the same for all. So, for each planet, P² ∝ a³ / M*, but since M* is the same, P² ∝ a³.

So, P3 / P1 = (a3/a1 )^(3/2 )

Because P is proportional to a^(3/2).

Wait, wait, Kepler's third law is P² = (4 π² / G M*) a³.

So, P² ∝ a³ / M*, so P ∝ a^(3/2) / (M*)^(1/2).

But since M* is the same for all, P3 / P1 = (a3/a1 )^(3/2 )

We have a3/a1 = 10.368 approximately.

So, (10.368)^(3/2 ) is what?

Let me compute that. 10.368 to the power 3/2 is the same as sqrt(10.368^3).

Alternatively, sqrt(10.368) is about 3.22, because 3.22^2 is 10.3684.

So, sqrt(10.368) ≈ 3.22.

Then, 10.368^3 is 10.368 *10.368 *10.368. Well, but perhaps it's easier to compute 10.368^(3/2) = (10.368^1) * (10.368^0.5) ) = 10.368 * 3.22 ≈ 33.38.

Wait, that seems high. Let me check:

10.368^1 is 10.368.

10.368^0.5 is about 3.22.

Multiplying them gives 10.368 * 3.22 ≈ ?

10 *3.22 is 32.2, 0.368 *3.22 ≈ 1.185. So total is about 33.385.

So, P3/P1 ≈ 33.385.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is ~33.4, which would fit this.

Wait, but before I conclude, let me make sure I didn't miss any other factors.

Wait, the problem also gives the mass ratios. The mass of Planet1 to Planet2 is 1.15, and Planet2 to Planet3 is 1.35. So, M2 = 1.15 M1, M3=1.35 M2 = 1.35 * 1.15 M1 = 1.5525 M1.

But wait, in Kepler's law, when considering the planet's mass, if the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass, which it usually is, then the planet's mass doesn't significantly affect the orbital period. Because the formula I used earlier, P² = (4 π² a³)/(G(M* + M_p)), but M_p is much smaller than M*, so M* + M_p ≈ M*. So, the planet's mass doesn't significantly affect the period. So, I can ignore the planet masses when applying Kepler's third law.

So, the mass ratios given (1.15 and 1.35) are probably a red herring, unless the problem is considering the TTV method, which is sensitive to the mass of the perturbing planets. But in this case, since the question is about the orbital periods, and the Kepler's law for each planet's period is determined by their distance from the star and the star's mass, the planet's mass doesn't affect that. So, I can safely ignore the mass ratios in finding the period ratios.

So, the answer should be around 33.4, which is option D.

To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we analyze the given data and apply relevant astronomical principles.

### Key Information and Relationships:
1. **Equilibrium Temperature Formula**:  
   The equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by:  
   \[
   T_{\text{eq}} = T_{\text{star}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a}} \cdot (1 - \text{albedo})^{1/4}
   \]  
   Since all planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, \(T_{\text{eq}} \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}}\), where \(a\) is the orbital distance.

2. **Orbital Period and Kepler's Third Law**:  
   From Kepler's third law, the orbital period \(P\) is related to the orbital distance \(a\) by:  
   \[
   P^2 \propto a^3
   \]  
   Thus, the ratio of orbital periods is given by:  
   \[
   \frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left(\frac{a_3}{a_1}\right)^{3/2}
   \]

3. **Given Ratios**:  
   - The equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is \(T_1 / T_2 = 1.4\).  
     Using \(T \propto 1 / \sqrt{a}\), we find:  
     \[
     \frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} \implies \frac{a_2}{a_1} = (1.4)^2 = 1.96
     \]  
     Thus, \(a_2 = 1.96 \cdot a_1\).  

   - The equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is \(T_2 / T_3 = 2.3\).  
     Similarly,  
     \[
     \frac{T_2}{T_3} = \sqrt{\frac{a_3}{a_2}} \implies \frac{a_3}{a_2} = (2.3)^2 = 5.29
     \]  
     Thus, \(a_3 = 5.29 \cdot a_2\).  

4. **Combining Distances**:  
   Substituting \(a_2 = 1.96 \cdot a_1\) into \(a_3 = 5.29 \cdot a_2\), we get:  
   \[
   a_3 = 5.29 \cdot 1.96 \cdot a_1 = 10.3684 \cdot a_1
   \]  
   Therefore, \(a_3 / a_1 = 10.3684\).

5. **Orbital Period Ratio**:  
   Using Kepler's law, the ratio of orbital periods is:  
   \[
   \frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left(\frac{a_3}{a_1}\right)^{3/2} = (10.3684)^{3/2}
   \]  
   First, calculate \(\sqrt{10.3684} \approx 3.22\). Then,  
   \[
   (10.3684)^{3/2} = 10.3684 \cdot 3.22 \approx 33.39
   \]  
   Thus, the orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1.

### Final Answer:
The factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 is approximately **33.4**.

Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, there are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They have circular orbits and were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variation. But I'm not too familiar with that, so maybe I'll ignore that detail for now.

The problem gives me some ratios. The equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 are about 1.4. Between Planet2 and Planet3, it's about 2.3. Also, the masses have ratios: Planet1 to Planet2 is 1.15, and Planet2 to Planet3 is 1.35. They want to find by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1's. All have the same albedo, 0.3, like Earth.

Hmm. I remember that equilibrium temperature relates to the distance from the star and the star's luminosity. The formula I think is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.25 )^(−1/2), wait, maybe I should get the exact formula right.

Wait, the equilibrium temperature formula is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.25. Or is it the other way around? No, wait, I think the formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.25 )^(-1/2)... Wait, maybe I'm mixing this up. Let me think again.

The equilibrium temperature for a planet is given by the formula:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.25

Wait, no, maybe the formula is T_eq = T_star * ( R_star / (2a) )^0.5 * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.25. So it's proportional to sqrt(R/(2a)) multiplied by the square root of (1 - albedo), but wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: The equilibrium temperature equation is based on the balance between the incoming stellar flux and the outgoing thermal radiation. The incoming flux is F = L_star/(4πa²), where L is the star's luminosity and a is the planet's orbital distance. The planet radiates as a blackbody, with F_out = σT_eq^4, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

Setting F = F_out, we get L/(4πa²) = σ T_eq^4 (1 - albedo) / (4π). Wait, because the planet reflects some light (albedo is the fraction reflected), so the absorbed flux is (1 - albedo) times the incident flux.

So, L/(4πa²) * (1 - albedo) = σ T_eq^4 / (4π).

Wait, perhaps simplifying:

L * (1 - albedo) / (4πa²) = σ T_eq^4 / (4π)

Multiply both sides by 4π:

L (1 - albedo) / a² = 4π σ T_eq^4

So, T_eq^4 = L (1 - albedo) / (4 π σ a² )

Taking the fourth root:

T_eq = [ L (1 - albedo) / (4 π σ a² ) ]^(1/4)

We can rearrange this as:

T_eq = [ L / (4 π σ) ]^(1/4) * [ (1 - albedo) / a² ]^(1/4 )

But L/(4πσ) is (L/(4πσ)) = (T_star^4 R_star^2 σ )/(4πσ) )? Wait, no, wait. Because L is the star's luminosity, and L = 4π R_star^2 σ T_star^4.

Because L is the power radiated by the star, which is a blackbody: L = 4 π R_star^2 σ T_star^4.

So substituting that into the T_eq equation:

T_eq = [ (4 π R_star^2 σ T_star^4) * (1 - albedo) ) / (4 π σ a²) ) ]^(1/4 )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

4 π cancels, σ cancels, so we have ( R_star^2 T_star^4 (1 - albedo) ) / a² ) )^(1/4 )

Which is [ R_star^2 * T_star^4 * (1-albedo) ]^(1/4 ) / a^(1/2 )

Wait, because (a²) in the denominator is a^2, so when you take the 1/4 power, it's a^(2*(1/4))=a^(1/2). So,

T_eq = T_star * R_star^(1/2) * (1 - albedo)^(1/4) / a^(1/2) )

Wait, because T_star^4 to the 1/4 is T_star^(1), R_star squared to the 1/4 is R_star^(1/2), and (1-albedo) to the 1/4 is as is. a squared to the 1/4 is a^(1/2).

Wait, no, wait. Let's see: the denominator is a^2, so when you take the fraction, the a is in the denominator. So, it's:

[ R_star^2 * T_star^4 * (1-albedo) ) ]^(1/4) / a^(1/2 )

Which is:

R_star^(2*(1/4)) * T_star^(4*(1/4)) * (1-albedo)^(1/4) ) / a^(1/2 )

Which is:

R_star^(0.5) * T_star^1 * (1-albedo)^0.25 / a^(0.5)

Which can be written as:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / a ) * (1 - albedo)^0.25

Wait, wait, that doesn't seem right. Because sqrt(R/a) is R^(0.5)/ a^0.5. So, T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(a)) ) * (1 - albedo)^0.25.

Wait, but in the previous step, I think I made a mistake. Let me redo the substitution.

We have:

L = 4 π R_star² σ T_star⁴

So substituting into T_eq:

T_eq^4 = [ L (1 - albedo) ] / (4 π σ a² )

= [4 π R_star² σ T_star^4 (1 - albedo) ] / (4 π σ a^2 )

The 4 π and σ cancel, leaving R_star² T_star^4 (1 - albedo) / a².

So,

T_eq^4 = (R_star² T_star^4 (1 - albedo)) / a²

Taking the fourth root,

T_eq = T_star * (R_star / a )^(1/2) * (1 - albedo)^(1/4)

Which can be written as:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(a)) * (1 - albedo)^(1/4)

Wait, but wait, since (R_star² / a² ) is (R_star/a)^2, so taking square root gives R_star/a.

Wait, no, let's see:

(R_star² / a²) is (R_star/a)^2, so (R_star/a)^2 to the 1/4 is (R_star/a)^(0.5), which is sqrt(R_star/a).

So,

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(a) ) * (1 - albedo)^(1/4)

Wait, but that can't be right because the a is in the denominator, so when you have sqrt(R/a), that's the same as R^0.5 / a^0.5.

Wait, perhaps I should reorganize this. Because if I write T_eq as proportional to sqrt( R/(a) ), then the temperature would increase with the square root of the star's radius and decrease with the square root of the planet's orbital distance.

But maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key point is that the equilibrium temperature depends on the star's temperature, the star's radius, the planet's distance, and the albedo.

But in this problem, all three planets orbit the same star, so T_star and R_star are the same for all. The albedo is given as 0.3 for all, so (1 - albedo) is 0.7 for all. So those factors are constants across all three planets.

So, for each planet, T_eq is proportional to sqrt( R_star / a ) * (1 - albedo)^(1/4 )

But since R_star and (1 - albedo) are the same for all, the ratio of T_eq between two planets depends only on the square root of (R_star/a) ratio.

Wait, but since R_star is the same for all, T_eq is proportional to 1/sqrt(a), because sqrt(R/a) is sqrt(R) / sqrt(a). So, if R is fixed, then sqrt(R) is a constant, so T_eq is proportional to 1/sqrt(a).

So, the equilibrium temperature inversely depends on the square root of the orbital distance. So, T_eq ∝ 1 / sqrt(a).

So, for Planet1 and Planet2, the ratio T1/T2 is given as 1.4.

Wait, no, wait. The problem says the ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.4. So T1 / T2 ≈ 1.4.

But since T_eq is inversely proportional to sqrt(a), so:

T1 / T2 = (a2 / a1 )^0.5

Because if a1 < a2, then T1 > T2.

Wait, wait, let me write the ratio:

T1 / T2 = (a2 / a1 )^0.5 ?

No, because T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a), so T1 / T2 = (a2 / a1 )^(-0.5) ) = (a1 / a2 )^0.5.

Because T1 = k / sqrt(a1), T2 =k / sqrt(a2). So T1 / T2 = sqrt(a2/a1).

Yes, because sqrt(a2/a1) is the same as (a2/a1)^(1/2).

So, T1 / T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) = 1.4.

So, a2/a1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96.

So, a2 = 1.96 a1.

Similarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3. So T2 / T3 = 2.3.

Again, T2 / T3 = sqrt( a3 / a2 )

So, sqrt(a3 / a2 ) = 2.3 → a3/a2 = (2.3)^2 = approx 5.29.

So, a3 = 5.29 a2.

Now, but I have a2 in terms of a1. a2 = 1.96 a1.

So, substituting, a3 = 5.29 * 1.96 a1.

Let me calculate that. 5.29 * 1.96.

Well, 5 * 1.96 is 9.8, 0.29 *1.96 is about 0.5684. So total is approx 10.3684.

So, a3 ≈ 10.3684 a1.

So, the distance of Planet3 is about 10.368 times that of Planet1.

But the question is about the orbital period. So, I need to find the ratio of the orbital periods P3/P1.

I recall Kepler's third law: (P^2)/(a^3) is proportional to 1/(M*), where M* is the mass of the star. But wait, the planets are orbiting the same star, so M* is the same for all. So, for each planet, P² ∝ a³ / M*, but since M* is the same, P² ∝ a³.

So, P3 / P1 = (a3/a1 )^(3/2 )

Because P is proportional to a^(3/2).

Wait, wait, Kepler's third law is P² = (4 π² / G M*) a³.

So, P² ∝ a³ / M*, so P ∝ a^(3/2) / (M*)^(1/2).

But since M* is the same for all, P3 / P1 = (a3/a1 )^(3/2 )

We have a3/a1 = 10.368 approximately.

So, (10.368)^(3/2 ) is what?

Let me compute that. 10.368 to the power 3/2 is the same as sqrt(10.368^3).

Alternatively, sqrt(10.368) is about 3.22, because 3.22^2 is 10.3684.

So, sqrt(10.368) ≈ 3.22.

Then, 10.368^3 is 10.368 *10.368 *10.368. Well, but perhaps it's easier to compute 10.368^(3/2) = (10.368^1) * (10.368^0.5) ) = 10.368 * 3.22 ≈ 33.38.

Wait, that seems high. Let me check:

10.368^1 is 10.368.

10.368^0.5 is about 3.22.

Multiplying them gives 10.368 * 3.22 ≈ ?

10 *3.22 is 32.2, 0.368 *3.22 ≈ 1.185. So total is about 33.385.

So, P3/P1 ≈ 33.385.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is ~33.4, which would fit this.

Wait, but before I conclude, let me make sure I didn't miss any other factors.

Wait, the problem also gives the mass ratios. The mass of Planet1 to Planet2 is 1.15, and Planet2 to Planet3 is 1.35. So, M2 = 1.15 M1, M3=1.35 M2 = 1.35 * 1.15 M1 = 1.5525 M1.

But wait, in Kepler's law, when considering the planet's mass, if the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass, which it usually is, then the planet's mass doesn't significantly affect the orbital period. Because the formula I used earlier, P² = (4 π² a³)/(G(M* + M_p)), but M_p is much smaller than M*, so M* + M_p ≈ M*. So, the planet's mass doesn't significantly affect the period. So, I can ignore the planet masses when applying Kepler's third law.

So, the mass ratios given (1.15 and 1.35) are probably a red herring, unless the problem is considering the TTV method, which is sensitive to the mass of the perturbing planets. But in this case, since the question is about the orbital periods, and the Kepler's law for each planet's period is determined by their distance from the star and the star's mass, the planet's mass doesn't affect that. So, I can safely ignore the mass ratios in finding the period ratios.

So, the answer should be around 33.4, which is option D.


To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we analyze the given data and apply relevant astronomical principles.

### Key Information and Relationships:
1. **Equilibrium Temperature Formula**:  
   The equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by:  
   \[
   T_{\text{eq}} = T_{\text{star}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a}} \cdot (1 - \text{albedo})^{1/4}
   \]  
   Since all planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, \(T_{\text{eq}} \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}}\), where \(a\) is the orbital distance.

2. **Orbital Period and Kepler's Third Law**:  
   From Kepler's third law, the orbital period \(P\) is related to the orbital distance \(a\) by:  
   \[
   P^2 \propto a^3
   \]  
   Thus, the ratio of orbital periods is given by:  
   \[
   \frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left(\frac{a_3}{a_1}\right)^{3/2}
   \]

3. **Given Ratios**:  
   - The equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is \(T_1 / T_2 = 1.4\).  
     Using \(T \propto 1 / \sqrt{a}\), we find:  
     \[
     \frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} \implies \frac{a_2}{a_1} = (1.4)^2 = 1.96
     \]  
     Thus, \(a_2 = 1.96 \cdot a_1\).  

   - The equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is \(T_2 / T_3 = 2.3\).  
     Similarly,  
     \[
     \frac{T_2}{T_3} = \sqrt{\frac{a_3}{a_2}} \implies \frac{a_3}{a_2} = (2.3)^2 = 5.29
     \]  
     Thus, \(a_3 = 5.29 \cdot a_2\).  

4. **Combining Distances**:  
   Substituting \(a_2 = 1.96 \cdot a_1\) into \(a_3 = 5.29 \cdot a_2\), we get:  
   \[
   a_3 = 5.29 \cdot 1.96 \cdot a_1 = 10.3684 \cdot a_1
   \]  
   Therefore, \(a_3 / a_1 = 10.3684\).

5. **Orbital Period Ratio**:  
   Using Kepler's law, the ratio of orbital periods is:  
   \[
   \frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left(\frac{a_3}{a_1}\right)^{3/2} = (10.3684)^{3/2}
   \]  
   First, calculate \(\sqrt{10.3684} \approx 3.22\). Then,  
   \[
   (10.3684)^{3/2} = 10.3684 \cdot 3.22 \approx 33.39
   \]  
   Thus, the orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1.

### Final Answer:
The factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 is approximately **33.4**.
