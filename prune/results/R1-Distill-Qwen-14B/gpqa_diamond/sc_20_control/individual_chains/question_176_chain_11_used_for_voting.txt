Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of all these concepts. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The question says that the state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, hold on—those are the elements? So the state vector is a 3x1 column matrix with entries [-1, 2, 1]. But wait, is that correct? Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually unit vectors, meaning their length (or norm) should be 1. Let me check that. The norm is the square root of the sum of squares of the components. So (-1)^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, 1^2 is 1. Adding them up gives 6, so the norm is sqrt(6). Hmm, so this vector isn't normalized. Oh, but maybe the question assumes it's normalized, or perhaps I should normalize it first before proceeding? Because in quantum mechanics, state vectors must be normalized.

Wait, the problem statement doesn't mention anything about normalizing the state vector. So perhaps the given vector is already normalized. Let me calculate again. 1 +4 +1=6, sqrt(6) is approximately 2.45. So the vector isn't normalized. Oh, but perhaps I should normalize it. Because in quantum mechanics, you can't have a state vector with a norm greater than one. So I'll proceed by normalizing it.

So the state vector is |ψ> = [ -1; 2; 1 ] divided by sqrt(6). Because each component is divided by the norm. So |ψ> = (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.

Next, the problem introduces two observables, P and Q. Their corresponding operators are given as matrices. I remember that observables correspond to Hermitian matrices because their eigenvalues (which represent possible measurement outcomes) are real. Let's look at the matrices.

Operator P's matrix is:
Row 1: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
Row 2: [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]
Row 3: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]

Wait, is that correct? Let me write it out.

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

And operator Q's matrix is:
Row 1: [1, 0, 0]
Row 2: [0, 0, 0]
Row 3: [0, 0, -1]

So Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. That makes sense because the diagonal entries are the eigenvalues for Q. So the possible outcomes when measuring Q are 1, 0, -1.

The question asks: What is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q when measuring P first, then Q?

Wait, no, the measurement order is P first, then Q. So the first measurement is P, and the second is Q. But wait, actually, the problem states, "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P"—so the order is P first, then Q. So the state collapses after each measurement.

But the question is about the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. So we're looking for P=0 and Q=-1. Let me think about the steps involved.

First, when you measure P, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of P. So I need to find the eigenvalues of P. Then, the probability of getting 0 is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state |ψ>.

But wait, let's think again. Observables are Hermitian, so P and Q are Hermitian matrices. So their eigenvalues are real.

So first, find the eigenvalues of P. Hmm, that might be a bit involved, but perhaps there's a pattern here. Looking at the matrix P, it's symmetric. Let me see if I can find its eigenvalues.

Alternatively, perhaps P can be expressed in terms of tensor products or simple operations. Let me inspect the structure of P.

Another approach: perhaps P is a square matrix that's a combination of Pauli matrices or something similar, but scaled. But since it's 3x3, maybe it's a spin operator in some basis.

Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate the eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation. The characteristic equation for a matrix is det(P - λI) = 0.

So for matrix P, subtract λ from the diagonal elements, and compute the determinant.

P - λI is:

[ -λ, 1/√2, 0 ]

[1/√2, -λ, 1/√2 ]

[ 0, 1/√2, -λ ]

So the determinant would be:

| -λ   1/√2    0      |
|1/√2  -λ   1/√2 | = 0
| 0    1/√2  -λ    |

Calculating this determinant. Let me use the first row for expansion.

The determinant would be:

-λ * det( [ -λ, 1/√2; 1/√2, -λ ] ) - (1/√2) * det( [1/√2, 1/√2; 0, -λ ] ) + 0 * something.

So first term: -λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] = -λ [ λ² - (1/2) ]

Second term: -(1/√2) [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ] = -(1/√2) [ (-λ/√2) ) ] = -(1/√2)(-λ/√2) = ( λ ) / 2.

Third term is zero.

So the determinant is:

-λ (λ² - 1/2) + (λ/2) = 0.

Expanding:

-λ^3 + (λ/2) + (λ/2) = 0

Wait, because -λ * (λ² - 1/2) = -λ^3 + (λ * 1/2 )

Wait, let me re-calculate that:

First term: -λ*(λ² - (1/√2)^2 ) = -λ (λ² - 1/2 ) = -λ^3 + (λ/2 )

Second term: -(1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - 0 ] = -(1/√2) * (-λ/√2 ) = (λ/2 )

So the determinant is [ -λ^3 + (λ/2) ] + (λ/2 ) = -λ^3 + λ = 0.

So the equation is -λ^3 + λ = 0 → λ( -λ² + 1 ) = 0 → λ (1 - λ² ) = 0 → λ=0 or λ=±1.

So the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, -1.

Wait, that's interesting. So possible outcomes when measuring P are 0, 1, -1.

Now, for each eigenvalue, we can find the eigenvectors, then compute the probability that the state |ψ> collapses to each eigenvector upon measuring P.

But since the question is about the probability of getting 0 for P, I'm only interested in the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0 of P.

So let's find the eigenvectors for P with λ=0.

We have (P - 0I) |v> = 0 → P |v> = 0.

So P is:

[0, 1/√2, 0 ]

[1/√2, 0, 1/√2 ]

[0, 1/√2, 0 ]

We can write the equations as:

Row 1: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → (1/√2) v2 = 0 → v2 = 0.

Row 2: (1/√2) v1 + 0 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 → v1 + v3 = 0 → v1 = -v3.

Row 3: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → same as row 1 → v2=0.

So the eigenvector for λ=0 is any vector where v2=0 and v1 = -v3. So it's a one-dimensional eigenspace.

We can choose v3 as a parameter. Let’s let v3 = a. Then v1 = -a, v2=0. So the eigenvector is [-a, 0, a]^T. We can factor out a, so the eigenvectors are scalar multiples of [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T.

But wait, let me double-check. Because if I plug into the matrix P, when |v> is [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T, what do I get?

P |v> = [0*(-1) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*1; (1/√2)*(-1) + 0*0 + (1/√2)*1; 0*(-1) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*1 ].

Calculating each component:

First component: 0 → 0.

Second component: (-1/√2) + (1/√2) → 0.

Third component: 0 → 0.

So yes, [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0. So the eigenspace is one-dimensional.

So the eigenvector can be written as |0> = [ -1; 0; 1 ] / normalization. Let's compute its norm: sqrt( (-1)^2 + 0^2 + 1^2 ) = sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/√2)[-1, 0, 1]^T.

So now, the probability of measuring P=0 is | <0|ψ> |^2.

But wait, our state |ψ> is [ -1; 2; 1 ] / sqrt(6). So let me compute the inner product <0|ψ>.

<0| = [ -1, 0, 1 ] / sqrt(2) (row vector).

ψ = [ -1; 2; 1 ] / sqrt(6).

So <0|ψ> = [ (-1)(-1) + 0*(2) + (1)(1) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) )

= [ 1 + 0 + 1 ] / (sqrt(12)) )

= 2 / (2*sqrt(3)) )

= 1 / sqrt(3).

So the inner product is 1/sqrt(3).

The probability is the square of the absolute value: (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.

So the probability of getting P=0 is 1/3.

Wait, but the question is about getting P=0 and Q=-1 in the respective measurements. So after measuring P=0, the state collapses to |0>, which is the eigenvector for P=0. Then, we measure Q on this new state.

Wait, but wait: when you measure P first, the system collapses to an eigenstate of P, which in this case is |0>, which as we found is [ -1, 0,1 ] / sqrt(2). So then, the state after P is measured is |0>.

Now, the second measurement is Q. So we need to find the probability that measuring Q on |0> gives -1.

But let's first find the eigenstates of Q. Looking at Q's matrix, it's diagonal:

Q = diag(1, 0, -1).

So the eigenstates are the standard basis vectors. So:

For eigenvalue 1: |1> = [1; 0; 0 ]

Eigenvalue 0: |0_Q> = [0; 1; 0 ]

Eigenvalue -1: |-1> = [0; 0; 1 ]

But wait, wait. Because Q is diagonal, its eigenstates are the basis vectors.

So any vector can be expressed as a linear combination of these eigenstates. So let's express |0> in terms of these.

|0> = [ -1; 0; 1 ] / sqrt(2) = (1/sqrt(2)) ( -|1> + 0 |0_Q> + | -1 > )

So |0> = ( -|1> + | -1 > ) / sqrt(2).

So when you measure Q on this state, the possible outcomes are 1 and -1, since the component for eigenvalue 0 is zero.

Wait, because the coefficient for |0_Q> is zero. So the state is a superposition of |1> and |-1> only.

So the probabilities are:

For Q=1: | coefficient of |1> |^2 → ( (-1)/sqrt(2) )^2 = 1/2.

For Q=-1: | coefficient of |-1> |^2 → (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

So the probability of measuring Q=-1 is 1/2.

Wait, but wait: No, because the state after P is measured is |0>, which is ( - |1> + | -1> ) / sqrt(2).

So when you project onto Q's eigenstates, each has a coefficient of magnitude 1/sqrt(2). So each has a probability of (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

So the probability of Q=-1 is 1/2.

But wait, the overall process is: first measure P=0 (prob 1/3), then measure Q=-1 (prob 1/2) given that the state is |0>.

So the combined probability is (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

Wait, no, because after the first measurement, the state is definitely |0>, so the second measurement is based on that state.

So yes, the probability of P=0 is 1/3, and given that, the probability of Q=-1 is 1/2. So the joint probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

Looking at the options, option D is 1/6. So the answer should be D.

The state of the system is given as a column vector \( |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \), which is not normalized. Its norm is calculated as \( \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6} \), so the normalized state is \( |\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \).

### Step 1: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \( P \)
The operator \( P \) is represented by the matrix:
\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
To find the eigenvalues, solve \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \). The characteristic equation simplifies to:
\[
-\lambda^3 + \lambda = 0 \implies \lambda (\lambda^2 - 1) = 0 \implies \lambda = 0, \pm 1.
\]
Thus, the eigenvalues of \( P \) are \( 0, 1, -1 \).

For \( \lambda = 0 \), solving \( (P - 0I)|v\rangle = 0 \) gives the eigenvector \( |0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \).

### Step 2: Probability of measuring \( P = 0 \)
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is the square of the overlap between \( |\psi\rangle \) and \( |0\rangle \):
\[
P(P=0) = |\langle 0 | \psi \rangle|^2.
\]
Compute \( \langle 0 | \psi \rangle \):
\[
\langle 0 | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} \left( (-1)(-1) + 0(2) + 1(1) \right) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]
Thus, \( P(P=0) = \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{3} \).

### Step 3: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \( Q \)
The operator \( Q \) is represented by the diagonal matrix:
\[
Q = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The eigenvalues of \( Q \) are \( 1, 0, -1 \), with corresponding eigenvectors:
\[
|1\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad |0\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad |-1\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 4: Probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) after \( P = 0 \)
After measuring \( P = 0 \), the state collapses to \( |0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \). Expressing \( |0\rangle \) in terms of \( Q \)'s eigenstates:
\[
|0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( -|1\rangle + |-1\rangle \right).
\]
The probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) is the square of the coefficient of \( |-1\rangle \):
\[
P(Q=-1 | P=0) = \left| \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 5: Combined probability
The combined probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is:
\[
P(P=0, Q=-1) = P(P=0) \cdot P(Q=-1 | P=0) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is \( \frac{1}{6} \).
