Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question in front of me. It's about ring-closing metathesis, which I remember is a reaction where two alkenes exchange parts to form a ring. The goal is to determine the starting material needed to synthesize 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, let's visualize the target molecule. The target is a cyclohexene ring. The substituents are isopropyl at position 5, and methyl groups at positions 3 and 4. So, the ring has six members, and the double bond is at position 1. Wait, cyclohexene usually has the double bond between carbons 1 and 2, so maybe I should number it differently. Oh wait, no, cyclohex-1-ene means the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, right? Because numbering starts such that the double bond has the lowest possible number.

Now, ring-closing metathesis (RCM) typically involves two alkenes. One of them is the part that will form the ring. So the starting material is an alkyne or diene that, when the metathesis happens, the ends come together to form a ring.

Wait, no, ring-closing metathesis uses a diene or dienophile. Oh, wait, no, metathesis is a reaction where alkenes exchange partners. So for RCM, the starting material would have two alkenes that are positioned in such a way that when the metathesis occurs, a ring forms.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diene with two double bonds, or maybe a diene where the two ends can come together. Alternatively, maybe a diene with substituents in positions that allow the ring to form when the ends are connected via the metathesis.

The target molecule is a cyclohexene, which has one double bond. So the starting material must have two alkenes that, upon metathesis, form the ring and one double bond.

Wait, so the starting material is an octadiene, perhaps, as the options all start with 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethyl-octa...something diene.

So the target has a six-membered ring. So the starting material must have eight carbons (octa) that, when two of the ends are connected, form a six-membered ring. Let me think about how that would work.

In RCM, the metal catalyst (like Grubbs) facilitates the breaking and reforming of carbon-carbon bonds between the two alkenes. So in the starting material, there are two alkenes (double bonds) that are positioned such that when the metathesis occurs, they form a ring.

Let me imagine the starting material as an octadiene with two double bonds. The positions of the substituents on the octadiene will determine where the ring forms and the structure of the cyclohexene.

Let me sketch this out. The target molecule, 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene, has substituents at positions 3 (methyl), 4 (methyl), and 5 (isopropyl). So the ring is cyclohexene, which is six carbons. So when the ring closes, the substituents will be in specific positions on the ring.

The starting material is an octa-diene. Let's number the octa chain. Suppose the octa chain is eight carbons long. When the ring forms, it should form a six-membered ring, so two of the carbons (the ends) will form the ring, and the remaining two carbons (from the starting octa) would be part of substituents or perhaps the double bonds.

Wait, perhaps the octa chain is such that two of its ends (with double bonds) will form the ring. So the starting material would be something like CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2? No, that seems too long. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an octadiene where the two double bonds are positioned in a way that when the metathesis happens, the ends connect to form a six-membered ring.

Wait, let me think about the reaction mechanism. In RCM, the olefin metathesis involves breaking and reforming the double bonds. The catalyst (Grubbs for example) will break the two double bonds and then reconnect them in a way that forms the ring.

So, the starting material has two alkenes. The positions of these alkenes determine where the ring forms.

Let me take an example. Suppose the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene. So the molecule has double bonds at positions 1 and 7.

In this case, the molecule would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2=CH2? Wait, no, octa-1,7-diene would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2? No, wait, octa-1,7-diene is eight carbons with double bonds at 1 and 7. So positions 1 and 2 are double bond, and positions 7 and 8 are double bond.

Wait, no. Wait, octa-1,7-diene would have double bonds at positions 1-2 and 7-8. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2? No, that's 9 carbons. Wait, octa is eight carbons, so positions 1-2 and 7-8 would not both be in the same molecule. Because 7 is the seventh carbon, so 7-8 would be the last two, but in an eight-carbon chain, the seventh is the seventh, and the eighth is the end.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me correct that. Octa-1,7-diene would be a molecule with double bonds starting at 1 and 7. So positions 1-2 and 7-8.

But wait, for an eight-carbon chain, the 7th and 8th would be the last two. So that would be possible. So octa-1,7-diene is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2? No, that's nine carbons. Wait, no, octa is eight carbons. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2? No, that's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's think again. For an octa-1,7-diene, the chain would have double bonds at 1-2 and 7-8. But wait, an octa chain has eight carbons. So positions 1-2 is one double bond, and 7-8 is another. But 7-8 in an eight-carbon chain would be between the 7th and 8th carbons. So the structure would be:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2? No, that's nine carbons because the last CH2=CH2 is two more. Wait, no, octa is 8 carbons. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2. Wait, but that's only eight, but with two double bonds.

Wait, perhaps the structure is: CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that's eight carbons. How can you have two double bonds in that?

Oh wait, maybe it's a diene, like CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2, but that's too long. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the starting material is a diene with two double bonds that are spaced in such a way that when the ring closes, the substituents end up in the correct positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diene with substituents at positions that when the ends are connected, the substituents end up at positions 3,4,5 in the ring.

Wait, let's think about the target molecule: cyclohexene with substituents at 3,4,5. So, three substituents on the ring. When the ring is formed, the substituents would have been part of the starting material's substituents.

So the starting material is an octadiene with substituents at 3 and 4 (methyl groups) and perhaps another substituent (isopropyl) at position 5.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an octadiene where the two double bonds are spaced in a way that when the ring forms, the substituents end up in the correct positions.

So, let's imagine the starting material as octa-1,5-diene, but wait the options don't have that. Let's look at the options again.

Options are:

A) 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene

B) 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene

C) 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene

D) 4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene

Wait, the target is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohexene. So in the starting material, the substituents must be in positions that when the ring closes, they end up in 3,4,5 positions.

So perhaps in the starting material, one substituent is on carbon 5, and the others are on 3 and 4.

Wait, but the starting material is a straight chain, so the substituents are in certain positions on the octadiene.

When the metathesis occurs, the two alkenes in the diene react, and the ends of the chain connect, forming the ring.

So, for example, if the starting material has double bonds at positions 1 and 6, then the two ends (1 and 6) would connect, forming a ring. Let's see: the number of carbons between the two double bonds would determine the ring size.

Wait, in RCM, the number of carbons between the two double bonds determines the ring size. So, for a six-membered ring, you need four carbons between the two double bonds. Because each double bond has two carbons. Wait, no. Let me think.

Each double bond is between two carbons. So, the chain between the two double bonds would have n carbons. The total ring size is 2 (from each double bond) + n. So, for a six-membered ring, 2 + n = 6 → n=4. So, between the two double bonds, there are four carbons.

So, the starting material has two double bonds with four carbons in between. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2? Wait, that's more than four. Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, no. Let's think in terms of the starting material. Suppose the starting material is a diene with two double bonds. The number of carbons between the two ends of the dienes (i.e., the positions of the double bonds) should be such that, when the ring forms, the ring is six-membered.

So, if the starting material has double bonds at positions 1 and 6, then the number of carbons between the two double bonds is 6-1-1 = 4 (positions 2,3,4,5). So that would form a six-membered ring.

Wait, let me count: positions 1-2 are a double bond. Positions 6-7 are another. Then the chain in between is positions 3,4,5,6? Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an 8-carbon diene with two double bonds. So, positions 1-2 and 6-7. The number of carbons between the two double bonds is 7-2 -1 = 4 (carbons 3,4,5,6). So that would form a six-membered ring (2 + 4 =6).

So, the starting material would have double bonds at positions 1 and 6, making the ring size 6.

Now, looking at the options:

Option C is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

So, this molecule has double bonds at 1 and 6, and substituents at 3,4 (methyl), and 5 (isopropyl).

So when the ring forms via metathesis, the double bonds at 1 and 6 would form the cyclohexene ring. The substituents at 3,4,5 would become the substituents on the cyclohexene ring.

Wait, but the cyclohexene has substituents at 3,4,5? No, the target is 3,4-dimethyl and 5-isopropyl. So the substituents are at positions 3,4,5 on the cyclohexene ring.

So, when the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene, the metathesis would bring together the ends of the double bonds (positions 1 and 6) to form the ring, making the cyclohexene. The substituents at positions 3,4,5 would then be on the ring.

But wait, in the starting material's structure, the substituents at 3,4 are methyl and 5 is isopropyl.

When the ring forms, the substituents at positions 3,4,5 of the octa chain would end up on the cyclohexene ring. Let's see:

The starting material is octa-1,6-diene. So, the structure is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2=CH2? No, wait, octa is 8 carbons.

Wait, no, octa-1,6-diene would have 8 carbons. So the structure is:

Carbons 1-2: double bond (CH2=CH-)
Then carbons 3,4,5,6 in the middle, with substituents at 3,4,5.
Carbons 7-8: another double bond (CH2-CH2=CH2?), but that's getting confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is:

(CH2=CH) - CH2 - CH(CH3) - CH(CH3) - CH(CH2CH3) - CH2 - (CH2=CH2)

Wait, that seems like more than 8 carbons. Hmm, perhaps I should draw this.

Let me number the octa chain from 1 to 8.

1: =CH2-

2: CH2-

3: CH(CH3)

4: CH(CH3)

5: CH(CH2CH3)

6: CH2-

7: CH2-

8: =CH2?

Wait, no. If the starting material is octa-1,6-diene, that would mean double bonds at 1-2 and 6-7.

So structure would be:

1: CH2=

2: CH-

3: CH2-

4: CH(CH3)

5: CH(CH3)

6: CH-

7: CH2=

8: CH2?

Wait, that doesn't seem right because octa is eight carbons, so positions 1-8.

So, the structure would be: CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2?

Wait, that's nine carbons. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused again.

Maybe a better approach is to consider that when the ring closes via metathesis, the substituents end up in the correct positions in the cyclohexene.

In the target molecule, the substituents are at 3,4,5. So, in the starting material, those substituents must be on carbons that are four positions apart from each other because the ring is six-membered.

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are on carbons that are four carbons apart in the starting material. Because when the ring forms, the distance between them becomes three in the ring.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about what happens during metathesis. The catalyst will break the double bonds and then rejoin them in a way that forms a ring. So, in the starting material, the two double bonds are in positions that, when the ring forms, the substituents will be in the correct positions.

So, for example, if the starting material has substituents at positions 3,4,5, and the double bonds are at positions 1 and 6, then upon ring closing, the substituents 3,4,5 would be at positions 3,4,5 of the cyclohexene ring.

Wait, let me imagine the starting material as follows:

OCTA-1,6-diene: CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2=CH2? No, but that would be nine carbons. Wait, perhaps it's CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2? No, that's 10 carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm not getting the structure right.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is: 

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2=CH2. Wait, but that's nine carbons. So maybe not.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the positions in terms of the ring.

The target is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene.

So, in the ring, the substituents are at positions 3,4,5. So when the ring forms, the substituents from the starting material must be on the appropriate carbons.

In the starting material, which is a straight chain, the substituents (methyl, methyl, isopropyl) are on certain positions, and the double bonds are in positions that allow the ring to form, bringing those substituents into the correct positions on the ring.

So, the starting material's structure would have the double bonds at positions 1 and 6 (octa-1,6-diene), and substituents at 3,4,5.

Which option has that? Let's check.

Option C is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

So, this would have double bonds at 1 and 6, and substituents at 3 (methyl), 4 (methyl), and 5 (isopropyl). So when the ring forms, the substituents at 3,4,5 would be in positions 3,4,5 on the cyclohexene.

So that would match the target structure.

Wait, but in the target, the cyclohexene has substituents on positions 3,4,5. So, in the starting material, the substituents are on 3,4,5, and the double bonds are at 1 and 6. So the ring would form by connecting the 1 and 6 ends, making a six-membered ring.

So the starting material would be option C.

Alternatively, let me consider what happens during metathesis. The two double bonds in the starting material would exchange partners. The Grubbs catalyst would facilitate the breaking of the two double bonds and then re-form them in a way that connects the ends, forming a ring.

So, the starting material has double bonds at 1 and 6 (octa-1,6-diene). The substituents at 3,4,5 are methyl, methyl, isopropyl.

So, when the ring is formed, the substituents end up at 3,4,5 of the cyclohexene.

Therefore, the correct starting material is option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the starting material needed to synthesize 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene via ring-closing metathesis (RCM), we analyze the structure of the target molecule and the nature of the reaction. The target molecule is a cyclohexene ring with substituents at positions 3 (methyl), 4 (methyl), and 5 (isopropyl). RCM involves a metal catalyst that facilitates the breaking and reforming of double bonds to form a ring. The starting material must be a diene with double bonds positioned such that, upon metathesis, the substituents end up in the correct positions on the cyclohexene ring.

The starting material is an octadiene with substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5, and double bonds at positions 1 and 6. This ensures that when the metathesis occurs, the ends of the diene connect to form a six-membered ring, with the substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 on the resulting cyclohexene. Among the given options:

- **Option A**: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene has double bonds at positions 1 and 7, which are too far apart to form a six-membered ring.
- **Option B**: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene has double bonds at positions 2 and 6, which would not result in the correct ring size or substituent positions.
- **Option C**: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene has double bonds at positions 1 and 6, with substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5. This structure is ideal for forming a six-membered ring with the substituents in the correct positions.
- **Option D**: 4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene has incorrect substituents and double bond positions, making it unsuitable.

Thus, the correct starting material is **5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene**, as it satisfies the requirements for RCM to produce the target molecule.

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question in front of me. It's about ring-closing metathesis, which I remember is a reaction where two alkenes exchange parts to form a ring.

In RCM, the metal catalyst (like Grubbs) facilitates the breaking and reforming of carbon-carbon bonds between the two alkenes. So in the starting material, there are two alkenes (double bonds) that are positioned such that when the metathesis occurs, they form a ring.

Let me imagine the starting material as an octadiene with two double bonds. The positions of the substituents on the octadiene will determine where the ring forms and the structure of the cyclohexene.

Let me sketch this out. The target molecule, 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene, has substituents at positions 3 (methyl), 4 (methyl), and 5 (isopropyl). So the ring is cyclohexene, which is six carbons. So when the ring closes, the substituents will be in specific positions on the ring.

Let me take an example. Suppose the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene. So the molecule has double bonds at positions 1 and 7.

In this case, the molecule would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2=CH2? Wait, no, octa-1,7-diene would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2? No, wait, octa-1,7-diene is eight carbons with double bonds at 1 and 7. So positions 1 and 2 are double bond, and positions 7 and 8 are double bond.

Wait, no. Wait, octa-1,7-diene would have double bonds at positions 1-2 and 7-8. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2? No, that's 9 carbons. Wait, octa is eight carbons, so positions 1-2 and 7-8 would not both be in the same molecule. Because 7 is the seventh carbon, so 7-8 would be the last two, but in an eight-carbon chain, the seventh is the seventh, and the eighth is the end.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me correct that. Octa-1,7-diene would be a molecule with double bonds starting at 1 and 7. So positions 1-2 and 7-8.

But wait, for an eight-carbon chain, the 7th and 8th would be the last two. So that would be possible. So octa-1,7-diene is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2? No, that's nine carbons. Wait, no, octa is eight carbons. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2? No, that's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's think again. For an octa-1,7-diene, the chain would have double bonds at 1-2 and 7-8. But wait, an octa chain has eight carbons. So positions 1-2 is one double bond, and 7-8 is another. But 7-8 in an eight-carbon chain would be between the 7th and 8th carbons. So the structure would be:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2? No, that's nine carbons because the last CH2=CH2 is two more. Wait, no, octa is 8 carbons. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2. Wait, but that's only eight, but with two double bonds.

Wait, perhaps the structure is: CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that's eight carbons. How can you have two double bonds in that?

Oh wait, maybe it's a diene, like CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2, but that's too long. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the starting material is a diene with two double bonds that are spaced in such a way that when the ring closes, the substituents end up in the correct positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diene with substituents at positions that when the ends are connected, the substituents end up at positions 3,4,5 in the ring.

Wait, let's think about the target molecule: cyclohexene with substituents at 3,4,5. So, three substituents on the ring. When the ring is formed, the substituents would have been part of the starting material's substituents.

So the starting material is an octadiene with substituents at 3 and 4 (methyl groups) and perhaps another substituent (isopropyl) at position 5.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an octadiene where the two double bonds are spaced in a way that when the ring forms, the substituents end up in the correct positions.

So, let's imagine the starting material as octa-1,5-diene, but wait the options don't have that. Let's look at the options again.

Options are:

A) 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene

B) 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene

C) 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene

D) 4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene

Wait, the target is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohexene. So in the starting material, the substituents must be in positions that when the ring closes, they end up in 3,4,5 positions.

So perhaps in the starting material, one substituent is on carbon 5, and the others are on 3 and 4.

Wait, but the starting material is a straight chain, so the substituents are in certain positions on the octadiene.

When the metathesis occurs, the two alkenes in the diene react, and the ends of the chain connect, forming the ring.

So, for example, if the starting material has double bonds at positions 1 and 6, then the two ends (1 and 6) would connect, forming a ring. Let's see: the number of carbons between the two double bonds would determine the ring size.

Wait, in RCM, the number of carbons between the two double bonds determines the ring size. So, for a six-membered ring, you need four carbons between the two double bonds. Because each double bond has two carbons. Wait, no. Let me think.

Each double bond is between two carbons. So, the chain between the two double bonds would have n carbons. The total ring size is 2 (from each double bond) + n. So, for a six-membered ring, 2 + n = 6 → n=4. So, between the two double bonds, there are four carbons.

So, the starting material has two double bonds with four carbons in between. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2? Wait, that's more than four. Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, no. Let's think in terms of the starting material. Suppose the starting material is a diene with two double bonds. The number of carbons between the two ends of the dienes (i.e., the positions of the double bonds) should be such that, when the ring forms, the ring is six-membered.

So, if the starting material has double bonds at positions 1 and 6, then the number of carbons between the two double bonds is 6-1-1 = 4 (positions 2,3,4,5). So that would form a six-membered ring.

Wait, let me count: positions 1-2 are a double bond. Positions 6-7 are another. Then the chain in between is positions 3,4,5,6? Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an 8-carbon diene with two double bonds. So, positions 1-2 and 6-7. The number of carbons between the two double bonds is 7-2 -1 = 4 (carbons 3,4,5,6). So that would form a six-membered ring (2 + 4 =6).

So, the starting material would have double bonds at positions 1 and 6, making the ring size 6.

Now, looking at the options:

Option C is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

So, this molecule has double bonds at 1 and 6, and substituents at 3,4 (methyl), and 5 (isopropyl).

So when the ring forms via metathesis, the double bonds at 1 and 6 would form the cyclohexene ring. The substituents at 3,4,5 would become the substituents on the cyclohexene ring.

Wait, but the cyclohexene has substituents at 3,4,5? No, the target is 3,4-dimethyl and 5-isopropyl. So the substituents are at positions 3,4,5 on the cyclohexene ring.

So, when the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene, the metathesis would bring together the ends of the double bonds (positions 1 and 6) to form the ring, making the cyclohexene. The substituents at positions 3,4,5 would then be on the ring.

But wait, in the starting material's structure, the substituents at 3,4 are methyl and 5 is isopropyl.

When the ring forms, the substituents at positions 3,4,5 of the octa chain would end up on the cyclohexene ring. Let's see:

The starting material is octa-1,6-diene. So, the structure is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2=CH2? No, wait, octa is 8 carbons.

Wait, no, octa-1,6-diene would have 8 carbons. So the structure is:

Carbons 1-2: double bond (CH2=CH-)
Then carbons 3,4,5,6 in the middle, with substituents at 3,4,5.
Carbons 7-8: another double bond (CH2-CH2=CH2?), but that's getting confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is:

(CH2=CH) - CH2 - CH(CH3) - CH(CH3) - CH(CH2CH3) - CH2 - (CH2=CH2)

Wait, that seems like more than 8 carbons. Hmm, perhaps I should draw this.

Let me number the octa chain from 1 to 8.

1: =CH2-

2: CH2-

3: CH(CH3)

4: CH(CH3)

5: CH(CH2CH3)

6: CH2-

7: CH2-

8: =CH2?

Wait, no. If the starting material is octa-1,6-diene, that would mean double bonds at 1-2 and 6-7.

So structure would be:

1: CH2=

2: CH-

3: CH2-

4: CH(CH3)

5: CH(CH3)

6: CH-

7: CH2=

8: CH2?

Wait, that doesn't seem right because octa is eight carbons, so positions 1-8.

So, the structure would be: CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2?

Wait, that's nine carbons. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused again.

Maybe a better approach is to consider that when the ring closes via metathesis, the substituents end up in the correct positions in the cyclohexene.

In the target molecule, the substituents are at 3,4,5. So, in the starting material, those substituents must be on carbons that are four positions apart from each other because the ring is six-membered.

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are on carbons that are four carbons apart in the starting material. Because when the ring forms, the distance between them becomes three in the ring.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about what happens during metathesis. The catalyst will break the double bonds and then rejoin them in a way that forms a ring. So, in the starting material, the two double bonds are in positions that, when the ring forms, the substituents will be in the correct positions.

So, for example, if the starting material has substituents at positions 3,4,5, and the double bonds are at positions 1 and 6, then upon ring closing, the substituents 3,4,5 would be at positions 3,4,5 of the cyclohexene ring.

Wait, let me imagine the starting material as follows:

OCTA-1,6-diene: CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2=CH2? No, but that would be nine carbons. Wait, perhaps it's CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2? No, that's 10 carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm not getting the structure right.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is: 

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2=CH2. Wait, but that's nine carbons. So maybe not.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the positions in terms of the ring.

The target is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene.

So, in the ring, the substituents are at positions 3,4,5. So when the ring forms, the substituents from the starting material must be on the appropriate carbons.

In the starting material, which is a straight chain, the substituents (methyl, methyl, isopropyl) are on certain positions, and the double bonds are in positions that allow the ring to form, bringing those substituents into the correct positions on the ring.

So, the starting material's structure would have the double bonds at positions 1 and 6 (octa-1,6-diene), and substituents at 3,4,5.

Which option has that? Let's check.

Option C is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

So, this would have double bonds at 1 and 6, and substituents at 3 (methyl), 4 (methyl), and 5 (isopropyl). So when the ring forms, the substituents at 3,4,5 would be in positions 3,4,5 on the cyclohexene.

So that would match the target structure.

Wait, but in the target, the cyclohexene has substituents on positions 3,4,5. So, in the starting material, the substituents are on 3,4,5, and the double bonds are at 1 and 6. So the ring would form by connecting the 1 and 6 ends, making a six-membered ring.

So the starting material would be option C.

Alternatively, let me consider what happens during metathesis. The two double bonds in the starting material would exchange partners. The Grubbs catalyst would facilitate the breaking of the two double bonds and then re-form them in a way that connects the ends, forming a ring.

So, the starting material has double bonds at 1 and 6 (octa-1,6-diene). The substituents at 3,4,5 are methyl, methyl, isopropyl.

So, when the ring is formed, the substituents end up at 3,4,5 of the cyclohexene.

Therefore, the correct starting material is option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.


To determine the starting material needed to synthesize 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene via ring-closing metathesis (RCM), we analyze the structure of the target molecule and the nature of the reaction. The target molecule is a cyclohexene ring with substituents at positions 3 (methyl), 4 (methyl), and 5 (isopropyl). RCM involves a metal catalyst that facilitates the breaking and reforming of double bonds to form a ring. The starting material must be a diene with double bonds positioned such that, upon metathesis, the substituents end up in the correct positions on the cyclohexene ring.

The starting material is an octadiene with substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5, and double bonds at positions 1 and 6. This ensures that when the metathesis occurs, the ends of the diene connect to form a six-membered ring, with the substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 on the resulting cyclohexene. Among the given options:

- **Option A**: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene has double bonds at positions 1 and 7, which are too far apart to form a six-membered ring.
- **Option B**: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene has double bonds at positions 2 and 6, which would not result in the correct ring size or substituent positions.
- **Option C**: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene has double bonds at positions 1 and 6, with substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5. This structure is ideal for forming a six-membered ring with the substituents in the correct positions.
- **Option D**: 4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene has incorrect substituents and double bond positions, making it unsuitable.

Thus, the correct starting material is **5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene**, as it satisfies the requirements for RCM to produce the target molecule.
