Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.

Alright, the setup: There's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity's radius is r, and r is less than R. The center of the cavity is a distance s from the center of the conductor. So, imagine a big sphere and a smaller cavity somewhere off-center inside it.

Then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. The question is asking about the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and the distance from P to the cavity's center is l. Also, l and L are both greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm, I remember that when charges are inside a conductor, the conductor's charges rearrange themselves. But wait, the conductor is initially uncharged. So, when the +q is placed inside the cavity, it should induce some charges on the inner and outer surfaces.

Wait, I think when a charge is inside a cavity of a conductor, the inner surface of the conductor will have an induced charge opposite to it. So, the inner surface would have -q, and since the conductor was neutral, the outer surface must have +q to balance it out. Because the conductor's total charge is zero, so inner surface (-q) and outer surface (+q) sum to zero. Wait, no, wait. If the conductor was initially neutral, adding +q would cause the inner surface to have -q, leaving the outer surface to have +q, because the total charge of the conductor remains zero. Or wait, no, the conductor was uncharged, so maybe the inner surface is -q, and the outer surface is +q. Because the conductor's net charge is zero, so inner (-q) and outer (+q) would cancel each other out. But wait, the conductor's overall charge would be inner (-q) + outer (+q) = zero. So yeah, that makes sense.

But wait, the conductor was initially uncharged, and we add a charge +q inside. So the conductor's inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface must have +q, so the total conductor's charge is zero. Because the conductor can't create charge, it just redistributes.

Now, the point P is outside the conductor (since L > R), so the field there would be due to the charges outside the conductor. But wait, the charges inside the conductor (the free charges) would create a field, but outside, the conductor behaves as if all the charge is concentrated at the center. Wait, no, that's when the conductor is a shell. But here, the conductor has a cavity, so the charges on the outer surface would be like a shell.

Wait, but the conductor is a solid sphere with a cavity. So the charges on the outer surface are uniformly distributed if the conductor is a conductor, but if the cavity's center is displaced, then the outer surface's charge distribution would depend on where the cavity is. Wait, but no, wait. The conductor's outer surface is a sphere, right? So regardless of where the cavity is, the outer surface's charge distribution would be spherically symmetric because the electric field inside a conductor must be zero. Wait, I'm a bit confused now.

Wait, no. If the cavity is off-center, the inner surface's charge would be non-uniform. Because the inner surface's charge distribution would mirror the charge inside the cavity. So if the charge +q is placed near the center of the cavity, which is off-center from the conductor's center, the inner surface would have an induced -q, but that would be non-uniform, more concentrated towards the direction of the charge. But the outer surface's charge would be uniform, because the conductor's outer surface must maintain a spherically symmetric distribution when viewed from outside. Because the conductor itself is a sphere. So the outer surface's charge would be +q, uniformly distributed, regardless of the inner cavity's position.

Wait, but wait. The conductor was initially neutral. When +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) would have -q, and the outer surface would have +q. Because the conductor as a whole must remain neutral. So the outer surface's charge is +q, and it's uniformly distributed because the conductor is a sphere. So the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform and spherical, because the conductor is a sphere, and any excess charge would distribute itself uniformly on the outer surface.

So now, when considering point P outside the conductor, the electric field there would be due to the charges outside the conductor. The conductor's outer surface has +q, so the field at P would be the same as if all that +q were concentrated at the center of the sphere. Because, for a point outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution, the field acts as if all the charge is at the center.

Wait, but wait. The conductor's outer surface has +q, but the inner charge (the conductor's inner surface) is -q, which is on the inner surface of the cavity. So when considering the field outside the conductor, the field would be due to the outer surface's +q. Because the inner charges are inside the conductor, their fields don't contribute outside.

Wait, no. The inner charge is on the inner surface, which is inside the conductor. So the conductor's material is between the inner surface (radius r_cavity) and outer surface (radius R). So when you're outside the conductor, the field is only due to the outer surface's charge, which is +q. So the field at point P would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/L², because L is the distance from the center of the conductor. Because the outer surface's +q is distributed spherically, so the field outside is same as point charge at center.

Wait, but let's get back to the problem. The options are A, B, C, D.

Looking at the options, option B is (1/(4πε₀)) * q/(L²). Option D is (1/(4πε₀)) * q/(l²). Hmm, but wait, the point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, but the distance from P to the cavity's center is l. And there's an angle θ between l and s.

Wait, but the outer surface's charge is +q, and it's uniformly distributed on the conductor's surface. So the electric field outside the conductor would be as if all the +q is at the center. So the electric field at P would be (1/(4πε₀))*(q)/(L²). So option B.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused because the point P is at a position that's L away from the conductor's center, but the distance from P to the cavity's center is l. So maybe the field at P depends on the position relative to the cavity's center? But no, I think that's not the case because the charges on the outer surface are what contribute to the field outside, and those are symmetrically placed around the conductor's center.

Wait, but what if the outer surface isn't spherically symmetric? Oh, no, because the conductor is a sphere. So the outer surface must be a sphere, making the charge distribution uniform. Because any excess charge on a conductor resides on the surface, and for a spherical conductor, it's uniformly distributed regardless of the cavity's position.

So, for point P outside, the field is the same as if the charge is at the center. So the field is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/L². So the answer would be option B.

Wait another thought: The charge inside the cavity induces a charge on the inner surface of the conductor, which is -q, but that's inside the conductor. The conductor is neutral, so the outer surface has +q. So the field outside is due to +q at the center.

So yeah, option B is correct. So the answer is B.

The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity of radius $r$ (where $r < R$). The center of the cavity is offset by a distance $s$ from the center of the conductor. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, and the task is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor and a distance $l$ from the center of the cavity. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

When the charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces a charge of $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor (the wall of the cavity). Since the conductor is initially neutral, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge of $+q$ to maintain charge neutrality. The charges on the outer surface of the conductor distribute themselves uniformly due to the spherical symmetry of the conductor.

For a point outside the conductor (where $L > R$), the electric field is determined by the charges on the outer surface of the conductor. The field outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution behaves as if all the charge is concentrated at the center of the sphere. Thus, the electric field at point $P$ is:

\[
E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
\]

This matches option **B**. The distances $l$ and $s$, as well as the angle $\theta$, do not affect the field at $P$ because the field outside the conductor depends only on the uniformly distributed charge on the outer surface, which is $+q$, and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor.

**Critical analysis of options:**
- **Option A:** Incorrect. The expression involves $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$, which is not relevant to the field at $P$ since the field depends only on the outer surface charge and $L$.
- **Option B:** Correct. The field at $P$ is due to the uniformly distributed charge $+q$ on the outer surface, and the field outside a sphere is given by $\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}$.
- **Option C:** Incorrect. The expression $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$ is not applicable here.
- **Option D:** Incorrect. While the field outside a sphere can be expressed as $\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{l^2}$, this would only apply if the charge were concentrated at the cavity's center, which is not the case.

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{B}
