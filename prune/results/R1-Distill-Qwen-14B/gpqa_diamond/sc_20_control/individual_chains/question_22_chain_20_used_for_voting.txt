Okay, so I've got this question about electrochemistry, and I need to figure it out. Let me try to break it down. The question is about the behavior of oxygen as an oxidant in different solutions—basic and acidic. The statements are about thermodynamics and kinetics.

Hmm, first, the question says that thermodynamically, oxygen is a … oxidant in basic solutions. What does that mean? Well, I remember that in electrochemistry, the strength of an oxidant is determined by its reduction potential. A stronger oxidant has a higher tendency to be reduced, so it's more likely to gain electrons.

Wait, but wait. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The oxidizing strength is determined by the reduction potential. A higher (more positive) E° means a stronger oxidizing agent. Because a higher E° indicates that the substance is more likely to be reduced.

So, in basic solutions, the reaction would involve OH- ions. The standard reduction potential for O2 in basic solution is higher than in acidic conditions. For example, in acidic solution, the O2 reduction is O2 + 4H+ + 4e- → 2H2O, with E° around 1.23 V. But in basic solution, the same reaction would involve OH- instead of H+. The reaction becomes O2 + 2H2O + 4e- → 4OH-, and the E° is higher, maybe around 0.401 V? Wait, no, wait. No, wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, actually, the E° in basic solution is calculated using the Nernst equation or by standard tables. Let me remember.

Wait, I think in acidic solution, the E° is higher. Because in acidic conditions, H+ is present, which could make the reaction more favorable. Alternatively, maybe it's the reverse. Let me think about O2 as an oxidizing agent. In acidic solution, the O2 reduction is more favorable because H+ helps in the reaction. So, the E° for O2 in acidic solution is higher than in basic. Wait, no, wait. No, wait, I'm getting this mixed up. Let me think about the standard potentials.

I recall that in acidic solution, the standard reduction potential for O2 is about 1.23 V. In basic solution, the E° is lower because the reaction is O2 + 2H2O + 4e- → 4OH-, which has an E° of about 0.401 V. Wait, that would mean that in acidic solution, O2 is a stronger oxidizing agent because its E° is higher. But wait, the question is about basic solutions. So, when the solution is basic, the O2 is a better oxidant because the E° is higher than in acidic? Wait, no, wait. No, that's not right. Because in the question, the first blank is for basic solutions. So, the first part is saying thermodynamically, O2 is a ... oxidant in basic solutions. So, is O2 a stronger or weaker oxidant in basic solutions compared to acidic?

Wait, if in acidic solution O2 has a higher E°, that makes it a stronger oxidant. But in basic solution, O2's E° is lower. So, O2 is a weaker oxidant in basic conditions than in acidic. Wait, but wait! No, wait. Wait, no, wait. Because in basic solution, the E° is lower, which would mean it's a weaker oxidizing agent. So, in basic solution, O2 is a weaker oxidant? So, the first blank would be 'weaker' or 'stronger'? Wait, I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing the oxidizing strength. Let me think differently. The tendency to be reduced. So, the higher the E°, the stronger the oxidizing agent. So, if in acidic solution, E° is higher, O2 is a stronger oxidizing agent there. So, in basic solution, where E° is lower, O2 is a weaker oxidizing agent.

So, thermodynamically, in basic solution, O2 is a weaker oxidant. So, the first blank is 'weaker'.

Wait, but wait. No, wait, another thought. Maybe the standard conditions are different. Because when the solution is basic, the pH is higher, so the presence of OH- ions might affect the reaction. Let me think about the actual reactions.

In acidic solution:
O2 + 4H+ + 4e- → 2H2O; E° = +1.23 V.

In basic solution:
O2 + 2H2O + 4e- → 4OH-; E° = +0.401 V.

So, in acidic, higher E°, so stronger oxidant. So, in basic, O2 is a weaker oxidant compared to the same in acidic.

So, the first part of the statement would be 'weaker' because in basic solution, the oxidizing strength is less than in acidic. Wait, but the first statement is about basic solutions. So, is O2 a stronger or weaker oxidant in basic solutions? Since in basic solution, O2's E° is 0.401 V, which is lower than in acidic. So, in basic solution, it's a weaker oxidant. So, the first blank is 'weaker'.

Wait, but the question is about comparing whether O2 is a stronger or weaker oxidant in basic. So, compared to what? To its oxidant strength in acidic, or to another oxidant in basic. Hmm, but the question's first part is about basic solutions. So, in basic solutions, O2 is a weaker oxidant than what it is in acidic. So, the statement says, thermodynamically, O2 is a ... oxidant in basic solutions. So, the ... is 'weaker' because compared to when it's in acidic, it's weaker.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe the question is comparing O2 in basic solution to another oxidant. No, I think it's just about O2's oxidant strength in basic versus acidic. So, thermodynamically, O2 is a weaker oxidant in basic solutions than in acidic.

So, the first part is 'weaker'.

Now, the second part is about kinetic aspects. It says, kinetically, oxygen reacts ... in acidic solutions. So, kinetic factors relate to reaction rates. How fast O2 reacts depends on the activation energy. So, in acidic or basic solutions, which condition allows O2 to react faster?

Wait, but O2 is a reactant in what reaction? Probably in redox reactions. For example, in acidic solution, O2 could be acting as an oxidizing agent, maybe in the reaction where it's reduced. So, the reaction rate would depend on the concentration of H+ ions because in acidic solution, H+ is high.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction in acidic solution is more favorable kinetically because of the presence of H+ ions that can facilitate the reaction. Or maybe the reaction is more favorable in acidic because of lower pH, which affects the reaction mechanism.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's think about the kinetics. In acidic solutions, the reaction of O2 (as an oxidizing agent) might have a lower activation energy because of the presence of H+ ions. Or perhaps the solution's acidity affects the solubility or the reaction mechanism.

Wait, another approach: think about the reaction rates in different pH conditions. In acidic solutions, maybe the reaction is faster because H+ can stabilize certain transition states or intermediates. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more kinetically favorable in acidic because the ions are more mobile, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but I remember that in some redox reactions, the presence of H+ can increase the reaction rate. For example, in the discharge of O2 in acidic conditions, the reaction might proceed faster because H+ ions help in the electron transfer process.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: In the thermodynamic case, O2 is a stronger oxidant in acidic solution. So, under thermodynamic control, it's a better oxidant there. But kinetically, maybe it's not as reactive. Or perhaps it is.

Wait, but the question is about whether O2 reacts faster or slower kinetically in acidic solutions. From the first part, in basic, O2 is a weaker oxidant (thermodynamic), but whether it reacts faster or slower kinetically.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the standard electrode potentials. In acidic solution, the E° is higher, so the reaction is more thermodynamically favorable. But if the activation energy is lower in acidic, the reaction would be faster. So, for the same reaction, perhaps the presence of H+ ions can lower the activation energy, making the reaction proceed faster kinetically.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction in acidic solution has a higher reaction rate because the H+ ions can act as catalysts or help in the electron transfer, making the reaction proceed more quickly.

So, for the second part of the statement, if the solution is acidic, O2 reacts faster. So, the second blank is 'faster'.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe in basic solutions, the reaction is faster because the solution is more conductive? No, that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, another angle: the reaction rate might depend on the concentration of ions. In acidic solutions, H+ is high, which could increase the ionic strength and thus the reaction rate, but sometimes higher ionic strength can cause more ion pairing, which might slow things down. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction involves protons, and in acidic conditions, the necessary protons are readily available, making the reaction proceed faster. So, in acidic solutions, O2 would react faster kinetically.

Putting it together: the first part is 'weaker' (since O2 is a weaker oxidant in basic), and the second part is 'faster' (O2 reacts faster in acidic solutions). So, looking at the options:

Options:
A) stronger – faster → No, first part is weaker.
B) stronger – slower → No.
C) weaker – faster → Yes.
D) weaker – slower → No.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. So, the first part says thermodynamic: O2 is a weaker oxidant in basic. Second part, kinetic: O2 reacts faster in acidic.

So, the combination is 'weaker' and 'faster', which is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves analyzing the behavior of oxygen (O₂) as an oxidant in basic and acidic solutions, focusing on thermodynamic and kinetic aspects.

1. **Thermodynamic Analysis**:  
   The strength of an oxidant is determined by its reduction potential (E°). In acidic solutions, the reduction potential of O₂ is higher (E° ≈ 1.23 V), making it a stronger oxidant. In basic solutions, the reduction potential is lower (E° ≈ 0.401 V), indicating that O₂ is a weaker oxidant in basic conditions compared to acidic conditions. Thus, thermodynamically, O₂ is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions.

2. **Kinetic Analysis**:  
   The reaction rate depends on the activation energy and the availability of ions like H⁺. In acidic solutions, the higher concentration of H⁺ ions can facilitate the reaction, potentially lowering the activation energy and making the reaction proceed faster. Therefore, kinetically, O₂ reacts **faster** in acidic solutions.

3. **Combining the Results**:  
   The first blank corresponds to the thermodynamic aspect, where O₂ is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions. The second blank corresponds to the kinetic aspect, where O₂ reacts **faster** in acidic solutions. This matches the combination in **Option C**.
