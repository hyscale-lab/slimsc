Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the minimum uncertainty in the energy of an electron given the uncertainty in its position and its speed.

Alright, let's read the question again. The electron is moving along the x-direction at v = 2e8 m/s. The uncertainty in its position, Δx, is 0.1 nanometers. We need to estimate the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE.

Wait, I remember the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It says that the product of the uncertainties in position and momentum must be at least h/(4π), where h is Planck's constant. So Δx * Δp ≥ h/(4π). 

But how does that relate to energy? Oh right, because momentum p is related to kinetic energy. The kinetic energy E is (p²)/(2m), where m is the mass of the electron. So the uncertainty in energy ΔE would be related to the uncertainty in momentum Δp.

So first, let's find Δp. Using the uncertainty principle: Δp ≈ h/(4πΔx). Wait, but sometimes people use h-bar (ħ) which is h/(2π), so maybe the formula is Δp ≥ ħ/Δx. Let me get that right. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle says Δx Δp ≥ ħ/2, but often people use Δx Δp ≈ ħ/2 for an estimate. So maybe I should calculate Δp as ħ/(2Δx).

Wait, let me think. ħ is h/(2π), so the original formula is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. So if I approximate Δp as ħ/(2Δx), that's okay for an estimate.

So, let's compute Δp. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. So ħ is h/(2π) ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

But wait, perhaps I can just use h/(4πΔx) as the approximate value for Δp? I need to get this right.

Wait, the formula is Δx * Δp ≥ h/(4π). So solving for Δp gives Δp ≥ h/(4πΔx). Alternatively, sometimes it's written as Δp ≈ h/(4πΔx) for minimum uncertainty. So I'll go with that.

So let's plug in the numbers. Δx is 0.1 nm. 1 nm is 1e-9 meters, so 0.1 nm is 1e-10 meters.

So h is 6.626e-34 J·s.

So Δp = (6.626e-34) / (4 * π * 1e-10). Let me compute that denominator first. 4 * π ≈ 12.566. Multiply by 1e-10 gives 1.2566e-9.

So Δp ≈ 6.626e-34 / 1.2566e-9 ≈ approximately 5.27e-25 kg·m/s.

Wait, let me do the division. 6.626e-34 / 1.2566e-9 = ?

6.626 /1.2566 ≈ around 5.27. Then 1e-34 divided by 1e-9 is 1e-25. So yes, 5.27e-25 kg·m/s.

Now, the momentum p is related to kinetic energy. The kinetic energy E is (p²)/(2m), where m is the mass of the electron. So the uncertainty in energy ΔE would be (Δp²)/(2m).

Wait, but since Δp is an uncertainty, the minimum uncertainty in energy would be (Δp)^2/(2m).

So m is the mass of the electron, which is about 9.109e-31 kg.

So ΔE = (5.27e-25)^2 / (2 * 9.109e-31).

Let me compute the numerator first. (5.27e-25)^2 is approximately (5.27)^2 ≈ 27.77, times 1e-50, so 2.777e-49.

Denominator: 2 * 9.109e-31 ≈ 1.8218e-30.

So ΔE ≈ (2.777e-49) / (1.8218e-30) ≈ approximately 1.524e-19 J.

Wait, wait. Let me do that division step by step.

2.777e-49 divided by 1.8218e-30 is (2.777 / 1.8218) * 1e-19.

2.777 /1.8218 ≈ approx 1.524. So 1.524e-19 J.

Looking at the options, option C is ~1e-19 J. So the answer would be C.

But wait, let me think again. Did I make any mistake in calculations?

Wait, let's double-check. Δp is h/(4πΔx). So that's 6.626e-34 / (4π * 1e-10).

4π is about 12.566, so 12.566e-10 is 1.2566e-9. So 6.626e-34 / 1.2566e-9 ≈ 5.27e-25 kg·m/s. That seems right.

Then, (5.27e-25)^2 is (5.27)^2 ≈ 27.77, so 27.77e-50 which is 2.777e-49. Then divided by (2m), where m is 9.109e-31 kg. 2m is 1.8218e-30 kg.

So 2.777e-49 / 1.8218e-30 ≈ 1.524e-19 J. So that's about 1.5e-19 J, which is roughly ~1e-19 J. So option C.

To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy \( \Delta E \) of an electron given the uncertainty in its position \( \Delta x = 0.1 \, \text{nm} \) and its speed \( v = 2 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and the relationship between momentum and kinetic energy.

### Step 1: Uncertainty in momentum (\( \Delta p \))
The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states:
\[
\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}, \quad \text{where } \hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi}.
\]
Using \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), we find:
\[
\hbar = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{2\pi} \approx 1.054 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}.
\]
For minimum uncertainty, \( \Delta p \approx \frac{\hbar}{2\Delta x} \). Substituting \( \Delta x = 0.1 \, \text{nm} = 1 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \):
\[
\Delta p \approx \frac{1.054 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \cdot 1 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
\]

### Step 2: Uncertainty in energy (\( \Delta E \))
The kinetic energy \( E \) is related to momentum by:
\[
E = \frac{p^2}{2m}, \quad \text{where } m = 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg}.
\]
The uncertainty in energy \( \Delta E \) is:
\[
\Delta E = \frac{(\Delta p)^2}{2m}.
\]
Substituting \( \Delta p = 5.27 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s} \) and \( m = 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \):
\[
\Delta E = \frac{(5.27 \times 10^{-25})^2}{2 \cdot 9.109 \times 10^{-31}}.
\]
First, calculate \( (\Delta p)^2 \):
\[
(\Delta p)^2 = (5.27)^2 \times 10^{-50} \approx 27.77 \times 10^{-50} = 2.777 \times 10^{-49}.
\]
Next, calculate the denominator:
\[
2m = 2 \cdot 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \approx 1.8218 \times 10^{-30}.
\]
Now, divide:
\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{2.777 \times 10^{-49}}{1.8218 \times 10^{-30}} \approx 1.524 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 3: Compare with options
The calculated \( \Delta E \approx 1.5 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \), which is closest to option \( \text{C} \) (~\( 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)).
