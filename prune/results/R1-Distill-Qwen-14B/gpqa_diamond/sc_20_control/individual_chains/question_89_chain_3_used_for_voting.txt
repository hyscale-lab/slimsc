Alright, I'm trying to tackle this organic chemistry problem. Okay, let me read it carefully.

So the question is about a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The first step is heating it with excess KOH at 240°C, which gives a light yellow solid product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to get product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

Hmm, okay. Let's break it down step by step.

First, what's 1,3-dibromoadamantane? Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, right? So 1,3-dibromo would have Br atoms at the 1 and 3 positions. Heating with KOH... wait, KOH is a strong base, and when dibromides are treated with base, it's usually an elimination reaction, E2. So when two bromines are on adjacent carbons, you get an elimination, but wait: 1 and 3 positions. Are they adjacent in the adamantane structure? Let me think. Adamantane has four fused cyclohexane rings. The 1 and 3 positions are on adjacent chairs, but not directly next to each other. So, I'm not sure if they're adjacent. Wait, perhaps I should draw the structure.

Wait, I might not need to get into the adamantane structure too deeply. Let me think about the reaction. When vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halogens) react with a base, they eliminate to form alkenes. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't vicinal; the Brs are on carbons that are two apart. So maybe the reaction isn't elimination but rather a substitution. Or perhaps it's a double elimination—maybe each Br leaves, but that would require two deprotonations, which might not be feasible.

Wait, but KOH in such a high temperature—maybe it's a double elimination. Alternatively, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination? Or perhaps it's an example of the formation of an epoxide. No, wait, KOH wouldn't form an epoxide. Alternatively, perhaps it's a double dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the product's NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's typically around where CH2 groups attached to an oxygen might appear, like an ether or an epoxide. But 4.79 is more like an ether or maybe an alcohol. Wait, but 4.79 with 2H could be a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone, but wait, the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. So maybe product 1 is an epoxide? Or a ketone.

Wait, let's think again. If KOH is used, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation. Since the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, maybe each Br is on a carbon that can eliminate. If each Br is on a carbon adjacent to another, perhaps the two eliminations occur, leading to formation of a double bond.

Wait, but where would the double bond form? Let me think about the structure of adamantane. Since 1 and 3 are not adjacent, maybe the elimination forms a bridge or a ring. Alternatively, perhaps the two Brs are on carbons that are across each other, leading to a ring contraction or expansion.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but substitution. Since KOH is a base, perhaps it abstracts a proton, leading to a carbanion, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Dieckmann-type elimination if it's a cyclic dihalide, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps when two bromides are present, the base could abstract a β-hydrogen for each, leading to the formation of two double bonds or a ring expansion. Alternatively, maybe it's a single elimination with loss of HBr twice, but that would require each Br to be on a position that can eliminate.

Wait, another approach: looking at the NMR. Product 1 has a 4.79 ppm (2H). That's a singlet? Or is it a doublet? The question says 4.79(2H), but doesn't specify the splitting. However, the 2.41-2.23 (10H) is likely the adamantane carbons, and 1.94 (2H) could be another CH2 group. Wait, but the IR shows 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a carbonyl. So product 1 is a ketone.

Wait, how can 1,3-dibromoadamantane become a ketone upon treatment with KOH? Maybe through elimination of HBr twice, forming a double bond, which would then undergo some tautomerism or maybe a different reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's an example of a Favorskii-type elimination, but I'm not familiar with that in this context.

Wait, alternatively, maybe each Br is on a bridgehead, and elimination would form a bridge with a double bond. But then, how would that result in a ketone?

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the initial reaction. 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1. The product's IR has 1720, which is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 is a ketone.

So, how does 1,3-dibromoadamantane become a ketone? Let me think about possible mechanisms. If each Br undergoes elimination, perhaps we form a carbonyl group. Wait, maybe each Br is adjacent to a bridgehead, and elimination would form a ring with a ketone.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the treatment with KOH leads to a double elimination, where each Br group is removed, and the adjacent carbons form double bonds, but that would produce an alkene, not a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an epoxide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is more like 1,3-dibromo in a way that when KOH is used, each Br is removed, and the two adjacent carbons (now each with a negative charge) form a bond, leading to a ring contraction. For example, in bicyclic systems, like norbornene, when two Brs are present, elimination can form a bridge. But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is adamantanone. Wait, adamantane with a ketone group. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules, forming a ketone. But wait, how?

Wait, perhaps each Br is on a carbon adjacent to a bridge, and when they eliminate, they form a carbonyl group. Let me think: each Br is on a bridgehead, perhaps. Eliminating two HBr would form a ketone in the center.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms an enol, which then tautomerizes to a ketone. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe KOH is acting as a base, abstracting a proton, leading to an elimination of Br and formation of a double bond, but since both Brs are present, maybe two eliminations occur, leading to a conjugated diene and then some rearrangement.

Wait, perhaps the product is 1,3-adamantanedione. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe each Br is eliminated as HBr, and the two carbons that lose Br form a double bond. But then, why would a ketone form?

Wait, perhaps the structure leads to a conjugated diene which then could undergo some further reaction, but under KOH conditions, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone. But that would require two carbonyl groups, which might not fit the NMR data.

Wait, the NMR of product 1 shows at 4.79 ppm (2H), which could be an OCH2 group, but that would imply an ether or an ester. But wait, the IR at 1720 is more likely a ketone.

Wait, maybe the product is a secondary alcohol? Because after elimination, perhaps an epoxide is formed, but that wouldn't explain the 1720 cm-1. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclic ether, but then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So maybe I'm wrong about the IR. Let me think other possibilities. 1720 cm⁻¹ could also be an ester or a ketone. So product 1 is either a ketone or an ester.

Wait, given that the starting material is a dihalide, and KOH is used, perhaps the product is an epoxide. But then, the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So perhaps it's a ketone.

Wait, another possibility: when two vicinal dihalides are treated with a base, they can undergo a double elimination to form an alkene. But in the case of 1,3-dibromoadamantane, maybe the two Brs are not on adjacent carbons but on positions that allow for a conjugated elimination, leading to formation of a ring with a double bond. Hmm.

Wait, but how does that produce a carbonyl? Alternatively, maybe the elimination isn't direct. Perhaps it's a ring-opening followed by a cyclization. I'm not exactly certain.

Wait, perhaps I should move on and think about the second step. Product 1 is then heated with aluminum isopropoxide. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But product 1, if it's a ketone, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of acylation.

Wait, but product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with excess aluminum isopropoxide. Another possibility is that product 1 is an alcohol, but that doesn't fit the IR. Oh wait, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, but then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So maybe I'm stuck here.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the NMR. Product 1's NMR shows 4.79 ppm (2H). That might be an OCH2 group, perhaps as an ether. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) could be the remaining adamantane structure (adamantane has several CH2 groups in the range of 1-2.5 ppm, but perhaps these are downfield shifted due to being near an electronegative group). The 1.94 ppm (2H) might be a CH2 adjacent to the O.

Wait, so perhaps product 1 is an ether, like an epoxide. An epoxide would have two adjacent CH2 groups, but the 4.79 ppm is more like a single CH2 next to an oxygen, perhaps. Or maybe it's a geminal diol, but that would be more like a broad peak around 1-2 ppm, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diol. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think differently. Maybe the first reaction isn't elimination but substitution. KOH might cause a substitution, but with two Brs, perhaps it forms a diol. But then why the IR shows a carbonyl?

Wait a second, another possibility: perhaps the product is a ketone, and the 4.79 (2H) is an OCH2 group, but that doesn't align. Alternatively, maybe it's a hemiacetal or something else.

Wait, maybe the product is a cyclic ether. For example, if the two Brs undergo elimination to form an epoxide. The epoxide would have two adjacent CH2O groups, but that would give two protons as a singlet or a doublet. But the 4.79 ppm is 2H, which could fit that. Then, in the IR, maybe the epoxide's C-O-C would show a peak, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the epoxide is not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diketone. Then, the 4.79 ppm would be something else, perhaps a methylene adjacent to a carbonyl.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me think about the possible structures and their NMR.

If product 1 is an epoxide (like 1,3-dioxa-adamantane or similar), then the epoxide protons would typically be around 3-4 ppm, perhaps as a triplet or a doublet. Wait, but in this case, it's 4.79, which is higher. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl group adjacent to a CH2.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms an amine. But I don't see how KOH would do that.

Wait, another angle: the IR at 1720 cm⁻¹ is strong for a carbonyl. So product 1 is a carbonyl compound. So, it must be either a ketone, aldehyde, ester, amide, or similar.

But given the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and KOH is used, perhaps it's a ketone. How?

Wait, maybe each Br is on a bridgehead, and upon elimination of HBr, a carbonyl forms.

Let me imagine: each Br is on a carbon adjacent to a bridge. Eliminating HBr from each would form a double bond or a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps each elimination leads to a carbonyl group. For example, in a norbornene system, elimination can form a ketone. So, maybe the two Brs are on adjacent bridgeheads, and upon elimination, each forms a carbonyl, but that seems unlikely as that would require two carbonyls.

Alternatively, perhaps after elimination, a single carbonyl is formed, with the two carbons that lost Br forming a double bond, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is a bicyclic ketone. For example, if the two Brs are eliminated as HBr, and the two adjacent carbons form a double bond, but that would produce an alkene, not a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the elimination isn't directly to a double bond but involves another process. Maybe the base abstracts a proton, leading to formation of a carbanion, which then forms a carbonyl via some rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a ring contraction, forming a smaller ring with a carbonyl. For example, if the adamantane structure contracts to a cyclohexenone.

But I'm not certain about this, so maybe I should move on and see if that makes sense with the next steps.

Assuming product 1 is a ketone, let's say it's 1-adamantanone. Then, when product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide, perhaps it undergoes a Friedel-Crafts acylation. But wait, Friedel-Crafts requires an aromatic ring, and adamantane doesn't have that. So, that can't be right.

Wait, another possibility: product 1 is a cyclic ketone, and when treated with Al(isopropoxide)3, it undergoes some kind of acylation or alkylation. But without an aromatic ring, Friedel-Crafts isn't applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide. Then, when heated with Al isopropoxide, maybe it undergoes ring-opening. But I'm not sure what product that would form.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether or an acetal. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an alkene, and product 2 is an epoxide formed via some reaction with Al isopropoxide. But I'm not certain.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider the next step. Product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, then dimethyl sulfide is added to form product 3. Ozone is used in ozonolysis, which cleaves alkenes into carbonyl compounds. So product 2 must have a double bond.

Wait, so product 2 has a double bond, and when ozonolysis is performed, it breaks into fragments. The coupling pattern in product 3 is what's being asked.

So, product 3 comes from ozonolysis of product 2.

So, product 2 must be an alkene. Therefore, the previous step (heating product 1 with Al isopropoxide) must form an alkene.

Wait, but product 1 is a ketone. How does that form an alkene upon heating with Al isopropoxide? Perhaps the ketone isn't product 1. Maybe product 1 is an epoxide, and product 2 is an alkene.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, which when heated with Al isopropoxide undergoes some ring-opening and then forms an alkene.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is the product of a Diels-Alder reaction, but that might require a diene and a dienophile.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try another approach.

Let me go back to the first reaction. 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1.

Looking up, I recall that when 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with a base like KOH, it undergoes a double dehydrohalogenation, forming 1,3-adamantadiene. Wait, but is that correct? Adamantadiene would have two double bonds? Or maybe just one double bond?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a single double bond, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: 1,3-dibromoadamantane could undergo elimination of two equivalents of HBr to form an annulene or another diene structure.

But then, product 1's IR has a carbonyl, so that doesn't fit. So perhaps product 1 isn't an alkene but a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that typically requires peracids and forms ketones. But KOH isn't a peracid.

Alternatively, perhaps the base induces a cleavage. For example, if the molecule is treated with KOH, perhaps it undergoes a cleavage reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a SN2 reaction, but with two Brs, that's unlikely.

Wait, maybe the product 1 is an epoxide. Then, upon treatment with Al isopropoxide, perhaps it undergoes acid-catalyzed ring-opening. But I'm not sure what that would form.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, which when heated with a Lewis acid forms an acid-catalyzed product, perhaps an ether.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating things. Let me try to find another approach.

The initial reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1. Product 1's NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is a singlet. Then, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicating a carbonyl.

If the 4.79 ppm is a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, then perhaps product 1 is a ketone with a CH2 next to it. For example, something like (CH2) next to a carbonyl. But how would that form from the starting material?

Wait, another thought: perhaps the product 1 is a butyrolactam or similar, but I don't see how that would form from a dihalide with KOH.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclic ketone. For example, the starting material could lose two HBr molecules, leading to a ring contraction and the formation of a ketone.

Wait, let's imagine that. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → upon elimination of 2 HBr, forms a smaller ring with a ketone.

So, for example, if the adamantane structure is a four-fused cyclohexane, eliminating two HBr could form a bridge with a carbonyl group. That would make product 1 a ketone. Then, the NMR would have a CH2 next to the carbonyl, hence the 4.79 ppm.

So, product 1 is a ketone, perhaps 1-adamantanone or similar.

Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide. What does that do? Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid and is used in various acylations or as a catalyst.

If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of Friedel-Crafts acylation, but again, without an aromatic ring, that's not applicable. Alternatively, perhaps it's undergoing an Aldol condensation if there's an alpha hydrogen.

Wait, but 1-adamantanone has alpha carbons. So, if product 1 is 1-adamantanone, heating it with Al isopropoxide could lead to a Claisen-Schmidt-type condensation, forming a larger ketone.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the Al isopropoxide is acting as a base or a catalyst for some elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps Al isopropoxide is a source of isopropoxide ions, which could transfer a methyl group or similar. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and Al isopropoxide is causing ring-opening via an acid catalysis, leading to an alcohol or another structure.

But I'm getting stuck again.

Wait, let's think about product 2. Since the next step is ozonolysis, product 2 must have a double bond. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So product 2 must be an alkene.

Therefore, product 2 is an alkene, which comes from product 1. So product 1 must be something that can form an alkene when treated with Al isopropoxide.

Wait, so if product 1 is a diol, then perhaps upon acid treatment (Al isopropoxide is acidic), it forms an alkene via dehydration. Alternatively, if product 1 is an alcohol with adjacent OH groups, heating with acid could cause elimination to form an alkene.

But product 1's IR is 1720 cm⁻¹, which doesn't fit an alcohol. So perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether or something else.

Hmm, maybe product 1 is a ketone, and when treated with Al isopropoxide, it undergoes a dehydration to form an alkene. Wait, but dehydration of a ketone doesn't typically form alkenes. Unless it's via an enol mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ketone, which upon treatment with acid forms an enol, which then could lose a water molecule to form a double bond.

Wait, but for that to happen, the cyclic ketone would need alpha hydrogens. 1-adamantanone has alpha hydrogens, so perhaps under acidic conditions, it could form an enol, which could lose H2O to form an alkene.

So product 2 would be an alkene adjacent to the ketone.

Wait, but then in product 2, the structure would have a double bond adjacent to a carbonyl group, making it a conjugated diene? Or just a simple alkene.

Wait, after the elimination, product 2 would have a double bond next to the ketone, leading to a conjugated enone.

Then, ozonolysis of product 2 would cleave the double bond, breaking it into carbonyl groups.

So, ozonolysis of a conjugated dienone (if that's the structure) would give two carbonyl groups. But wait, the starting material for ozonolysis is product 2, which is an alkene.

Wait, so product 2 is an alkene, so when product 2 undergoes ozonolysis, it would break into carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have multiple carbonyl groups.

Now, the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3.

Wait, the most deshielded would be the one closest to an electronegative group, like a carbonyl. So perhaps it's an alpha hydrogen to a carbonyl.

In ozonolysis, the breaking of the double bond leads to the formation of carbonyl groups. For each R group attached to the double bond, the ozonolysis would add O's, leading to carbonyls.

So, if product 2 is 1,2-adamantadiene (for example), ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl compounds.

But I'm not sure about the exact structure. Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a simple alkene, like in a ring structure, leading to ozonolysis products with carbonyl groups.

Assuming product 3 has a carbonyl group, the hydrogen adjacent to it would be deshielded. The coupling pattern depends on neighboring protons.

If the hydrogen is next to another hydrogen, it would couple as a doublet. But if it's next to two different sets, like two and three, perhaps a triplet of triplets or another pattern.

Wait, but in the NMR of product 3, we're looking for the most deshielded hydrogen, which is probably near a carbonyl. Let's imagine that in product 3, the hydrogen adjacent to the carbonyl is a CH2 group. Each CH2 would couple with adjacent protons.

Wait, for example, if the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-R', the CH2 next to the carbonyl would have neighboring protons. Suppose it's a CH2 group next to another CH2, which is next to another CH2, but that depends on the structure.

Alternatively, maybe the structure after ozonolysis leads to a diketone, where the protons adjacent to the carbonyl are a pair of protons that are each split by neighboring protons.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that each carbonyl is adjacent to a CH2 group. Each CH2 would have two protons. The protons on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be split by the protons on the adjacent CH2 group.

So, for example, if you have a structure like (CH2)n-CO-R, the CH2 next to CO would have coupling with the next CH2. Each proton in the CH2 would couple with two protons from the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet for each.

But wait, that would make each proton a triplet. So the most deshielded hydrogen (on the CH2 next to CO) would be a triplet.

Looking at the options, option A is triplet.

But wait, in product 3, the coupling could be more complex if there are more neighboring groups. Alternatively, maybe each CH2 is next to another group that has more protons, leading to a more complex splitting.

Alternatively, if the structure is such that the CH2 group is next to a CH group with two protons, the coupling could be a triplet of triplets or a doublet of triplets.

Wait, but without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. So perhaps the correct answer is a triplet.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded hydrogen is a singlet, but the options don't include that.

Wait, but in the NMR, the most deshielded hydrogen is probably on a CH2 next to a carbonyl. If that CH2 is next to another CH2 which is split into a triplet, then the coupling would be a triplet.

Wait, another possibility: if the CH2 is between two CH2 groups, each with two protons, the coupling would be a triplet of triplets, but that seems less likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 next to the carbonyl is adjacent to a CH2 group that is itself split into a triplet, making the coupling a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Another approach: in ozonolysis, when a symmetrical alkene is cleaved, you get two identical carbonyl compounds. For an unsymmetrical alkene, you get two different products.

Assuming product 2 is a symmetrical alkene, product 3 would have two identical carbonyl groups. The protons adjacent to these would have the same environment.

So, if the structure is R-CO-CH2-CHO, for example, but that's just a guess. Alternatively, perhaps it's something like R-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-R, which would lead to the CH2 groups being adjacent to carbonyls.

In that case, each CH2 would have two neighboring groups: the carbonyl and another CH2. The protons on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be split by the adjacent CH2's protons.

So, each of these protons would see two neighboring protons (each from the adjacent CH2 group), leading to a triplet for each.

But wait, if each proton in the CH2 is split by two neighboring protons (from the adjacent CH2), each would have two neighbors. So each proton would be a doublet, but since they are equivalent, perhaps the splitting is a triplet.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about it as the CH2 group next to the carbonyl. Each of its protons is adjacent to two protons from the neighboring CH2 group. So each proton would couple with two others, leading to a triplet.

So the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

Looking back at the options, option A is triplet.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Upon heating with KOH, the product (product 1) is identified as a ketone based on the IR spectrum (1720 cm⁻¹, indicative of a carbonyl group) and the NMR data (4.79 ppm for 2H, likely a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl). The reaction likely involves a double elimination of HBr, forming a ketone such as 1-adamantanone.

Next, product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide. This step likely leads to the formation of an alkene (product 2) through an acid-catalyzed dehydration or rearrangement. The presence of a double bond in product 2 is confirmed by the subsequent ozonolysis step.

Ozonolysis of product 2 at -78°C, followed by addition of dimethylsulfide, cleaves the double bond in product 2, forming product 3. Ozonolysis typically converts alkenes into carbonyl compounds. In product 3, the most deshielded hydrogen is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group. This hydrogen would couple with neighboring protons, and the coupling pattern depends on the number of adjacent protons.

Given the structure of product 3, the most deshielded hydrogen is on a CH₂ group directly adjacent to a carbonyl group. This CH₂ group is likely flanked by another CH₂ group, leading to a coupling pattern of a triplet for the most deshielded hydrogen.

Thus, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a triplet.

Answer: A

Alright, I'm trying to tackle this organic chemistry problem. Okay, let me read it carefully.

So the question is about a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The first step is heating it with excess KOH at 240°C, which gives a light yellow solid product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to get product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

Hmm, okay. Let's break it down step by step.

First, what's 1,3-dibromoadamantane? Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, right? So 1,3-dibromo would have Br atoms at the 1 and 3 positions. Heating with KOH... wait, KOH is a strong base, and when dibromides are treated with base, it's usually an elimination reaction, E2. So when two bromines are on adjacent carbons, you get an elimination, but wait: 1 and 3 positions. Are they adjacent in the adamantane structure? Let me think. Adamantane has four fused cyclohexane rings. The 1 and 3 positions are on adjacent chairs, but not directly next to each other. So, I'm not sure if they're adjacent. Wait, perhaps I should draw the structure.

Wait, I might not need to get into the adamantane structure too deeply. Let me think about the reaction. When vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halogens) react with a base, they eliminate to form alkenes. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't vicinal; the Brs are on carbons that are two apart. So maybe the reaction isn't elimination but rather a substitution. Or perhaps it's a double elimination—maybe each Br leaves, but that would require two deprotonations, which might not be feasible.

Wait, but KOH in such a high temperature—maybe it's a double elimination. Alternatively, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination? Or perhaps it's an example of the formation of an epoxide. No, wait, KOH wouldn't form an epoxide. Alternatively, perhaps it's a double dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the product's NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's typically around where CH2 groups attached to an oxygen might appear, like an ether or an epoxide. But 4.79 is more like an ether or maybe an alcohol. Wait, but 4.79 with 2H could be a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone, but wait, the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. So maybe product 1 is an epoxide? Or a ketone.

Wait, let's think again. If KOH is used, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation. Since the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, maybe each Br is on a carbon that can eliminate. If each Br is on a carbon adjacent to another, perhaps the two eliminations occur, leading to formation of a double bond.

Wait, but where would the double bond form? Let me think about the structure of adamantane. Since 1 and 3 are not adjacent, maybe the elimination forms a bridge or a ring. Alternatively, perhaps the two Brs are on carbons that are across each other, leading to a ring contraction or expansion.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but substitution. Since KOH is a base, perhaps it abstracts a proton, leading to a carbanion, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Dieckmann-type elimination if it's a cyclic dihalide, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps when two bromides are present, the base could abstract a β-hydrogen for each, leading to the formation of two double bonds or a ring expansion. Alternatively, maybe it's a single elimination with loss of HBr twice, but that would require each Br to be on a position that can eliminate.

Wait, another approach: looking at the NMR. Product 1 has a 4.79 ppm (2H). That's a singlet? Or is it a doublet? The question says 4.79(2H), but doesn't specify the splitting. However, the 2.41-2.23 (10H) is likely the adamantane carbons, and 1.94 (2H) could be another CH2 group. Wait, but the IR shows 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a carbonyl. So product 1 is a ketone.

Wait, how can 1,3-dibromoadamantane become a ketone upon treatment with KOH? Maybe through elimination of HBr twice, forming a double bond, which would then undergo some tautomerism or maybe a different reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's an example of a Favorskii-type elimination, but I'm not familiar with that in this context.

Wait, alternatively, maybe each Br is on a bridgehead, and elimination would form a bridge with a double bond. But then, how would that result in a ketone?

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the initial reaction. 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1. The product's IR has 1720, which is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 is a ketone.

So, how does 1,3-dibromoadamantane become a ketone? Let me think about possible mechanisms. If each Br undergoes elimination, perhaps we form a carbonyl group. Wait, maybe each Br is adjacent to a bridgehead, and elimination would form a ring with a ketone.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the treatment with KOH leads to a double elimination, where each Br group is removed, and the adjacent carbons form double bonds, but that would produce an alkene, not a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an epoxide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is more like 1,3-dibromo in a way that when KOH is used, each Br is removed, and the two adjacent carbons (now each with a negative charge) form a bond, leading to a ring contraction. For example, in bicyclic systems, like norbornene, when two Brs are present, elimination can form a bridge. But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is adamantanone. Wait, adamantane with a ketone group. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules, forming a ketone. But wait, how?

Wait, perhaps each Br is on a carbon adjacent to a bridge, and when they eliminate, they form a carbonyl group. Let me think: each Br is on a bridgehead, perhaps. Eliminating two HBr would form a ketone in the center.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms an enol, which then tautomerizes to a ketone. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe KOH is acting as a base, abstracting a proton, leading to an elimination of Br and formation of a double bond, but since both Brs are present, maybe two eliminations occur, leading to a conjugated diene and then some rearrangement.

Wait, perhaps the product is 1,3-adamantanedione. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe each Br is eliminated as HBr, and the two carbons that lose Br form a double bond. But then, why would a ketone form?

Wait, perhaps the structure leads to a conjugated diene which then could undergo some further reaction, but under KOH conditions, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone. But that would require two carbonyl groups, which might not fit the NMR data.

Wait, the NMR of product 1 shows at 4.79 ppm (2H), which could be an OCH2 group, but that would imply an ether or an ester. But wait, the IR at 1720 is more likely a ketone.

Wait, maybe the product is a secondary alcohol? Because after elimination, perhaps an epoxide is formed, but that wouldn't explain the 1720 cm-1. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclic ether, but then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So maybe I'm wrong about the IR. Let me think other possibilities. 1720 cm⁻¹ could also be an ester or a ketone. So product 1 is either a ketone or an ester.

Wait, given that the starting material is a dihalide, and KOH is used, perhaps the product is an epoxide. But then, the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So perhaps it's a ketone.

Wait, another possibility: when two vicinal dihalides are treated with a base, they can undergo a double elimination to form an alkene. But in the case of 1,3-dibromoadamantane, maybe the two Brs are not on adjacent carbons but on positions that allow for a conjugated elimination, leading to formation of a ring with a double bond. Hmm.

Wait, but how does that produce a carbonyl? Alternatively, maybe the elimination isn't direct. Perhaps it's a ring-opening followed by a cyclization. I'm not exactly certain.

Wait, perhaps I should move on and think about the second step. Product 1 is then heated with aluminum isopropoxide. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But product 1, if it's a ketone, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of acylation.

Wait, but product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with excess aluminum isopropoxide. Another possibility is that product 1 is an alcohol, but that doesn't fit the IR. Oh wait, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, but then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So maybe I'm stuck here.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the NMR. Product 1's NMR shows 4.79 ppm (2H). That might be an OCH2 group, perhaps as an ether. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) could be the remaining adamantane structure (adamantane has several CH2 groups in the range of 1-2.5 ppm, but perhaps these are downfield shifted due to being near an electronegative group). The 1.94 ppm (2H) might be a CH2 adjacent to the O.

Wait, so perhaps product 1 is an ether, like an epoxide. An epoxide would have two adjacent CH2 groups, but the 4.79 ppm is more like a single CH2 next to an oxygen, perhaps. Or maybe it's a geminal diol, but that would be more like a broad peak around 1-2 ppm, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diol. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think differently. Maybe the first reaction isn't elimination but substitution. KOH might cause a substitution, but with two Brs, perhaps it forms a diol. But then why the IR shows a carbonyl?

Wait a second, another possibility: perhaps the product is a ketone, and the 4.79 (2H) is an OCH2 group, but that doesn't align. Alternatively, maybe it's a hemiacetal or something else.

Wait, maybe the product is a cyclic ether. For example, if the two Brs undergo elimination to form an epoxide. The epoxide would have two adjacent CH2O groups, but that would give two protons as a singlet or a doublet. But the 4.79 ppm is 2H, which could fit that. Then, in the IR, maybe the epoxide's C-O-C would show a peak, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the epoxide is not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diketone. Then, the 4.79 ppm would be something else, perhaps a methylene adjacent to a carbonyl.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me think about the possible structures and their NMR.

If product 1 is an epoxide (like 1,3-dioxa-adamantane or similar), then the epoxide protons would typically be around 3-4 ppm, perhaps as a triplet or a doublet. Wait, but in this case, it's 4.79, which is higher. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl group adjacent to a CH2.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms an amine. But I don't see how KOH would do that.

Wait, another angle: the IR at 1720 cm⁻¹ is strong for a carbonyl. So product 1 is a carbonyl compound. So, it must be either a ketone, aldehyde, ester, amide, or similar.

But given the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and KOH is used, perhaps it's a ketone. How?

Wait, maybe each Br is on a bridgehead, and upon elimination of HBr, a carbonyl forms.

Let me imagine: each Br is on a carbon adjacent to a bridge. Eliminating HBr from each would form a double bond or a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps each elimination leads to a carbonyl group. For example, in a norbornene system, elimination can form a ketone. So, maybe the two Brs are on adjacent bridgeheads, and upon elimination, each forms a carbonyl, but that seems unlikely as that would require two carbonyls.

Alternatively, perhaps after elimination, a single carbonyl is formed, with the two carbons that lost Br forming a double bond, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is a bicyclic ketone. For example, if the two Brs are eliminated as HBr, and the two adjacent carbons form a double bond, but that would produce an alkene, not a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the elimination isn't directly to a double bond but involves another process. Maybe the base abstracts a proton, leading to formation of a carbanion, which then forms a carbonyl via some rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a ring contraction, forming a smaller ring with a carbonyl. For example, if the adamantane structure contracts to a cyclohexenone.

But I'm not certain about this, so maybe I should move on and see if that makes sense with the next steps.

Assuming product 1 is a ketone, let's say it's 1-adamantanone. Then, when product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide, perhaps it undergoes a Friedel-Crafts acylation. But wait, Friedel-Crafts requires an aromatic ring, and adamantane doesn't have that. So, that can't be right.

Wait, another possibility: product 1 is a cyclic ketone, and when treated with Al(isopropoxide)3, it undergoes some kind of acylation or alkylation. But without an aromatic ring, Friedel-Crafts isn't applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide. Then, when heated with Al isopropoxide, maybe it undergoes ring-opening. But I'm not sure what product that would form.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether or an acetal. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an alkene, and product 2 is an epoxide formed via some reaction with Al isopropoxide. But I'm not certain.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider the next step. Product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, then dimethyl sulfide is added to form product 3. Ozone is used in ozonolysis, which cleaves alkenes into carbonyl compounds. So product 2 must have a double bond.

Wait, so product 2 has a double bond, and when ozonolysis is performed, it breaks into fragments. The coupling pattern in product 3 is what's being asked.

So, product 3 comes from ozonolysis of product 2.

So, product 2 must be an alkene. Therefore, the previous step (heating product 1 with Al isopropoxide) must form an alkene.

Wait, but product 1 is a ketone. How does that form an alkene upon heating with Al isopropoxide? Perhaps the ketone isn't product 1. Maybe product 1 is an epoxide, and product 2 is an alkene.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, which when heated with Al isopropoxide undergoes some ring-opening and then forms an alkene.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is the product of a Diels-Alder reaction, but that might require a diene and a dienophile.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try another approach.

Let me go back to the first reaction. 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1.

Looking up, I recall that when 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with a base like KOH, it undergoes a double dehydrohalogenation, forming 1,3-adamantadiene. Wait, but is that correct? Adamantadiene would have two double bonds? Or maybe just one double bond?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a single double bond, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: 1,3-dibromoadamantane could undergo elimination of two equivalents of HBr to form an annulene or another diene structure.

But then, product 1's IR has a carbonyl, so that doesn't fit. So perhaps product 1 isn't an alkene but a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that typically requires peracids and forms ketones. But KOH isn't a peracid.

Alternatively, perhaps the base induces a cleavage. For example, if the molecule is treated with KOH, perhaps it undergoes a cleavage reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a SN2 reaction, but with two Brs, that's unlikely.

Wait, maybe the product 1 is an epoxide. Then, upon treatment with Al isopropoxide, perhaps it undergoes acid-catalyzed ring-opening. But I'm not sure what that would form.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, which when heated with a Lewis acid forms an acid-catalyzed product, perhaps an ether.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating things. Let me try to find another approach.

The initial reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1. Product 1's NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is a singlet. Then, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicating a carbonyl.

If the 4.79 ppm is a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, then perhaps product 1 is a ketone with a CH2 next to it. For example, something like (CH2) next to a carbonyl. But how would that form from the starting material?

Wait, another thought: perhaps the product 1 is a butyrolactam or similar, but I don't see how that would form from a dihalide with KOH.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclic ketone. For example, the starting material could lose two HBr molecules, leading to a ring contraction and the formation of a ketone.

Wait, let's imagine that. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → upon elimination of 2 HBr, forms a smaller ring with a ketone.

So, for example, if the adamantane structure is a four-fused cyclohexane, eliminating two HBr could form a bridge with a carbonyl group. That would make product 1 a ketone. Then, the NMR would have a CH2 next to the carbonyl, hence the 4.79 ppm.

So, product 1 is a ketone, perhaps 1-adamantanone or similar.

Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide. What does that do? Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid and is used in various acylations or as a catalyst.

If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of Friedel-Crafts acylation, but again, without an aromatic ring, that's not applicable. Alternatively, perhaps it's undergoing an Aldol condensation if there's an alpha hydrogen.

Wait, but 1-adamantanone has alpha carbons. So, if product 1 is 1-adamantanone, heating it with Al isopropoxide could lead to a Claisen-Schmidt-type condensation, forming a larger ketone.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the Al isopropoxide is acting as a base or a catalyst for some elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps Al isopropoxide is a source of isopropoxide ions, which could transfer a methyl group or similar. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and Al isopropoxide is causing ring-opening via an acid catalysis, leading to an alcohol or another structure.

But I'm getting stuck again.

Wait, let's think about product 2. Since the next step is ozonolysis, product 2 must have a double bond. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So product 2 must be an alkene.

Therefore, product 2 is an alkene, which comes from product 1. So product 1 must be something that can form an alkene when treated with Al isopropoxide.

Wait, so if product 1 is a diol, then perhaps upon acid treatment (Al isopropoxide is acidic), it forms an alkene via dehydration. Alternatively, if product 1 is an alcohol with adjacent OH groups, heating with acid could cause elimination to form an alkene.

But product 1's IR is 1720 cm⁻¹, which doesn't fit an alcohol. So perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether or something else.

Hmm, maybe product 1 is a ketone, and when treated with Al isopropoxide, it undergoes a dehydration to form an alkene. Wait, but dehydration of a ketone doesn't typically form alkenes. Unless it's via an enol mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ketone, which upon treatment with acid forms an enol, which then could lose a water molecule to form a double bond.

Wait, but for that to happen, the cyclic ketone would need alpha hydrogens. 1-adamantanone has alpha hydrogens, so perhaps under acidic conditions, it could form an enol, which could lose H2O to form an alkene.

So product 2 would be an alkene adjacent to the ketone.

Wait, but then in product 2, the structure would have a double bond adjacent to a carbonyl group, making it a conjugated diene? Or just a simple alkene.

Wait, after the elimination, product 2 would have a double bond next to the ketone, leading to a conjugated enone.

Then, ozonolysis of product 2 would cleave the double bond, breaking it into carbonyl groups.

So, ozonolysis of a conjugated dienone (if that's the structure) would give two carbonyl groups. But wait, the starting material for ozonolysis is product 2, which is an alkene.

Wait, so product 2 is an alkene, so when product 2 undergoes ozonolysis, it would break into carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have multiple carbonyl groups.

Now, the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3.

Wait, the most deshielded would be the one closest to an electronegative group, like a carbonyl. So perhaps it's an alpha hydrogen to a carbonyl.

In ozonolysis, the breaking of the double bond leads to the formation of carbonyl groups. For each R group attached to the double bond, the ozonolysis would add O's, leading to carbonyls.

So, if product 2 is 1,2-adamantadiene (for example), ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl compounds.

But I'm not sure about the exact structure. Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a simple alkene, like in a ring structure, leading to ozonolysis products with carbonyl groups.

Assuming product 3 has a carbonyl group, the hydrogen adjacent to it would be deshielded. The coupling pattern depends on neighboring protons.

If the hydrogen is next to another hydrogen, it would couple as a doublet. But if it's next to two different sets, like two and three, perhaps a triplet of triplets or another pattern.

Wait, but in the NMR of product 3, we're looking for the most deshielded hydrogen, which is probably near a carbonyl. Let's imagine that in product 3, the hydrogen adjacent to the carbonyl is a CH2 group. Each CH2 would couple with adjacent protons.

Wait, for example, if the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-R', the CH2 next to the carbonyl would have neighboring protons. Suppose it's a CH2 group next to another CH2, which is next to another CH2, but that depends on the structure.

Alternatively, maybe the structure after ozonolysis leads to a diketone, where the protons adjacent to the carbonyl are a pair of protons that are each split by neighboring protons.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that each carbonyl is adjacent to a CH2 group. Each CH2 would have two protons. The protons on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be split by the protons on the adjacent CH2 group.

So, for example, if you have a structure like (CH2)n-CO-R, the CH2 next to CO would have coupling with the next CH2. Each proton in the CH2 would couple with two protons from the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet for each.

But wait, that would make each proton a triplet. So the most deshielded hydrogen (on the CH2 next to CO) would be a triplet.

Looking at the options, option A is triplet.

But wait, in product 3, the coupling could be more complex if there are more neighboring groups. Alternatively, maybe each CH2 is next to another group that has more protons, leading to a more complex splitting.

Alternatively, if the structure is such that the CH2 group is next to a CH group with two protons, the coupling could be a triplet of triplets or a doublet of triplets.

Wait, but without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. So perhaps the correct answer is a triplet.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded hydrogen is a singlet, but the options don't include that.

Wait, but in the NMR, the most deshielded hydrogen is probably on a CH2 next to a carbonyl. If that CH2 is next to another CH2 which is split into a triplet, then the coupling would be a triplet.

Wait, another possibility: if the CH2 is between two CH2 groups, each with two protons, the coupling would be a triplet of triplets, but that seems less likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 next to the carbonyl is adjacent to a CH2 group that is itself split into a triplet, making the coupling a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Another approach: in ozonolysis, when a symmetrical alkene is cleaved, you get two identical carbonyl compounds. For an unsymmetrical alkene, you get two different products.

Assuming product 2 is a symmetrical alkene, product 3 would have two identical carbonyl groups. The protons adjacent to these would have the same environment.

So, if the structure is R-CO-CH2-CHO, for example, but that's just a guess. Alternatively, perhaps it's something like R-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-R, which would lead to the CH2 groups being adjacent to carbonyls.

In that case, each CH2 would have two neighboring groups: the carbonyl and another CH2. The protons on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be split by the adjacent CH2's protons.

So, each of these protons would see two neighboring protons (each from the adjacent CH2 group), leading to a triplet for each.

But wait, if each proton in the CH2 is split by two neighboring protons (from the adjacent CH2), each would have two neighbors. So each proton would be a doublet, but since they are equivalent, perhaps the splitting is a triplet.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about it as the CH2 group next to the carbonyl. Each of its protons is adjacent to two protons from the neighboring CH2 group. So each proton would couple with two others, leading to a triplet.

So the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

Looking back at the options, option A is triplet.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Upon heating with KOH, the product (product 1) is identified as a ketone based on the IR spectrum (1720 cm⁻¹, indicative of a carbonyl group) and the NMR data (4.79 ppm for 2H, likely a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl). The reaction likely involves a double elimination of HBr, forming a ketone such as 1-adamantanone.

Next, product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide. This step likely leads to the formation of an alkene (product 2) through an acid-catalyzed dehydration or rearrangement. The presence of a double bond in product 2 is confirmed by the subsequent ozonolysis step.

Ozonolysis of product 2 at -78°C, followed by addition of dimethylsulfide, cleaves the double bond in product 2, forming product 3. Ozonolysis typically converts alkenes into carbonyl compounds. In product 3, the most deshielded hydrogen is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group. This hydrogen would couple with neighboring protons, and the coupling pattern depends on the number of adjacent protons.

Given the structure of product 3, the most deshielded hydrogen is on a CH₂ group directly adjacent to a carbonyl group. This CH₂ group is likely flanked by another CH₂ group, leading to a coupling pattern of a triplet for the most deshielded hydrogen.

Thus, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a triplet.

Answer: A
