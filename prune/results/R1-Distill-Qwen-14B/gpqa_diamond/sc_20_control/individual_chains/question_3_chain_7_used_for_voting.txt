Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem says a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. These |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of σz, the Pauli z-matrix. The question is asking for the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. Hmm, right.

I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated as ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where O is the operator and |ψ⟩ is the state. So here, O is 10σz +5σx.

Wait, since expectation values are linear, maybe I can break this into two parts: the expectation of 10σz and the expectation of 5σx, then add them together.

So let's think about each term separately.

First, the σz part. Because |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of σz, calculating the expectation of σz should be straightforward. The eigenvalues for σz are +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ respectively.

The state is given as psi = 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Wait, let me check: 0.5 squared plus (sqrt(3)/2)^2 equals 0.25 + 3/4 = 1. So the state is normalized, that's good.

The expectation value of σz, ⟨σz⟩, is the sum of |amplitude|^2 multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

So for |↑⟩, the amplitude is 0.5. The probability is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. For |↓⟩, the amplitude is sqrt(3)/2, so the probability is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4.

So ⟨σz⟩ = (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. Oh wait, because |↓⟩ is the eigenstate with eigenvalue -1, right.

Then, the expectation value for 10σz is 10 * ⟨σz⟩ = 10 * (-0.5) = -5.

Okay, that's the first part done.

Now onto the σx part. Hmm, σx is the Pauli x matrix. Its eigenstates are different, though. I think the eigenstates are |+x⟩ and |-x⟩, which are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. Alternatively, maybe I can compute ⟨σx⟩ directly without changing the basis.

The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ can be found using the formula ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩.

Let me write out psi in terms of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. So ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, where a=0.5, b=sqrt(3)/2.

Then ⟨ψ| is a* ⟨↑| + b* ⟨↓|, right? Because ⟨ψ| is the conjugate transpose.

So the expectation value of σx is:

⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = a* b ⟨↑|σx|↓⟩ + a* a ⟨↑|σx|↑⟩ + b* b ⟨↓|σx|↓⟩ + b* a ⟨↓|σx|↑⟩.

Wait, but σx is a Hermitian operator, so its matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], right? So σx|↑⟩ = |↓⟩, and σx|↓⟩ = |↑⟩.

Hmm, let me compute this step by step.

Compute each term:

⟨↑|σx|↑⟩ is the element at (1,1) of σx. Wait, actually, σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when you apply σx to |↑⟩, which is [1; 0], you get [0;1] which is |↓⟩. So the inner product ⟨↑|σx|↑⟩ is ⟨↑|↓⟩ which is zero.

Similarly, ⟨↓|σx|↓⟩ is zero as well. So the diagonal terms are zero.

The off-diagonal terms:

a* b ⟨↑|σx|↓⟩ = a* b ⟨↑|↑⟩, because σx|↓⟩ is |↑⟩. So ⟨↑|↑⟩ is 1. So this term is a* b.

Similarly, the term b* a ⟨↓|σx|↑⟩ is b* a ⟨↓|↓⟩, which is 1. So that's b* a.

So overall, ⟨σx⟩ = a* b + b* a.

Since a and b are real numbers in this case (the coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2, both real), the complex conjugates are the same as the original. So a* =a and b* =b.

So ⟨σx⟩ = a*b + b*a = 2 a b.

Let me compute that. a =0.5, b= sqrt(3)/2.

So a*b = 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/4 ≈ 0.4330.

So 2 * (sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So ⟨σx⟩ ≈ 0.8660.

Then, the expectation value of 5σx is 5 * 0.8660 ≈ 4.330.

Now, adding the two parts together: the 10σz part was -5 and the 5σx part is about 4.330.

So total expectation value is -5 + 4.330 = -0.66999..., which is approximately -0.67.

Wait, but wait, the options don't have a -0.6. Let me check the options again.

Options are A: -1.4, B: 1.65, C: -0.7, D:0.85.

Hmm, -0.67 is close to -0.7. So option C is -0.7. But let me make sure I didn't make any mistake in calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should do the calculation more precisely.

Let me recompute 2 a b.

a is 0.5, b is sqrt(3)/2.

So a*b = 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) = (sqrt(3))/4.

Multiply by 2: 2 * (sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660254.

So 5 * that is 5 * 0.8660254 = 4.330127.

10 * ⟨σz⟩ was -5, as before.

So adding -5 +4.330127 = -0.669873.

Rounded to one decimal place, that's -0.7. So option C.

Wait, but the possible answers don't have -0.7, but let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A) -1.4

B) 1.65

C) -0.7

D) 0.85

Yes, option C is -0.7.

So the answer should be C.

To calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given spin-half particle in the state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \), we proceed as follows:

### 1. Expectation Value of \( 10\sigma_z \)
The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) of \( \sigma_z \) have eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively. The expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is given by:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = \sum_i |c_i|^2 \lambda_i,
\]
where \( c_i \) are the coefficients of \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) in \( \psi \), and \( \lambda_i \) are the corresponding eigenvalues.

For \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \), the probabilities are:
\[
|c_{\uparrow}|^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25, \quad |c_{\downarrow}|^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 0.75.
\]
Thus:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]
The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z \) is:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z \rangle = 10 \cdot \langle \sigma_z \rangle = 10 \cdot (-0.5) = -5.
\]

### 2. Expectation Value of \( 5\sigma_x \)
The operator \( \sigma_x \) has eigenstates \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), but since \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are not eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \), we compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \) directly using:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle.
\]
Expanding \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \), the expectation value becomes:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = a^* b + b^* a,
\]
where \( a = 0.5 \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \). Since \( a \) and \( b \) are real:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2ab = 2 \cdot 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866.
\]
The expectation value of \( 5\sigma_x \) is:
\[
\langle 5\sigma_x \rangle = 5 \cdot \langle \sigma_x \rangle = 5 \cdot 0.866 \approx 4.33.
\]

### 3. Total Expectation Value
Adding the contributions from \( 10\sigma_z \) and \( 5\sigma_x \):
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = \langle 10\sigma_z \rangle + \langle 5\sigma_x \rangle = -5 + 4.33 \approx -0.67.
\]
Rounded to one decimal place, this is \( -0.7 \).

### Final Answer
The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is closest to **-0.7**, which corresponds to option **C**.

So ⟨σz⟩ = (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. Oh wait, because |↓⟩ is the eigenstate with eigenvalue -1, right.

Then, the expectation value for 10σz is 10 * ⟨σz⟩ = 10 * (-0.5) = -5.

Okay, that's the first part done.

Now onto the σx part. Hmm, σx is the Pauli x matrix. Its eigenstates are different, though. I think the eigenstates are |+x⟩ and |-x⟩, which are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. Alternatively, maybe I can compute ⟨σx⟩ directly without changing the basis.

Let me write out psi in terms of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. So ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, where a=0.5, b=sqrt(3)/2.

Then ⟨ψ| is a* ⟨↑| + b* ⟨↓|, right? Because ⟨ψ| is the conjugate transpose.

So the expectation value of σx is:

⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = a* b ⟨↑|σx|↓⟩ + a* a ⟨↑|σx|↑⟩ + b* b ⟨↓|σx|↓⟩ + b* a ⟨↓|σx|↑⟩.

Wait, but σx is a Hermitian operator, so its matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], right? So σx|↑⟩ = |↓⟩, and σx|↓⟩ = |↑⟩.

Similarly, ⟨↓|σx|↓⟩ is zero as well. So the diagonal terms are zero.

The off-diagonal terms:

a* b ⟨↑|σx|↓⟩ = a* b ⟨↑|↑⟩, because σx|↓⟩ is |↑⟩. So ⟨↑|↑⟩ is 1. So this term is a* b.

Similarly, the term b* a ⟨↓|σx|↑⟩ is b* a ⟨↓|↓⟩, which is 1. So that's b* a.

So overall, ⟨σx⟩ = a* b + b* a.

Since a and b are real numbers in this case (the coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2, both real), the complex conjugates are the same as the original. So a* =a and b* =b.

So ⟨σx⟩ = a*b + b*a = 2 a b.

Let me compute that. a =0.5, b= sqrt(3)/2.

So a*b = 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/4 ≈ 0.4330.

So 2 * (sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So ⟨σx⟩ ≈ 0.8660.

Then, the expectation value of 5σx is 5 * 0.8660 ≈ 4.330.

Now, adding the two parts together: the 10σz part was -5 and the 5σx part is about 4.330.

So total expectation value is -5 + 4.330 = -0.66999..., which is approximately -0.67.

Wait, but wait, the options don't have a -0.6. Let me check the options again.

Options are A: -1.4, B: 1.65, C: -0.7, D:0.85.

Hmm, -0.67 is close to -0.7. So option C is -0.7. But let me make sure I didn't make any mistake in calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should do the calculation more precisely.

Let me recompute 2 a b.

a is 0.5, b is sqrt(3)/2.

So a*b = 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) = (sqrt(3))/4.

Multiply by 2: 2 * (sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660254.

So 5 * that is 5 * 0.8660254 = 4.330127.

10 * ⟨σz⟩ was -5, as before.

So adding -5 +4.330127 = -0.669873.

Rounded to one decimal place, that's -0.7. So option C.

So the answer should be C.


To calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given spin-half particle in the state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \), we proceed as follows:

### 1. Expectation Value of \( 10\sigma_z \)
The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) of \( \sigma_z \) have eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively. The expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is given by:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = \sum_i |c_i|^2 \lambda_i,
\]
where \( c_i \) are the coefficients of \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) in \( \psi \), and \( \lambda_i \) are the corresponding eigenvalues.

For \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \), the probabilities are:
\[
|c_{\uparrow}|^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25, \quad |c_{\downarrow}|^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 0.75.
\]
Thus:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]
The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z \) is:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z \rangle = 10 \cdot \langle \sigma_z \rangle = 10 \cdot (-0.5) = -5.
\]

### 2. Expectation Value of \( 5\sigma_x \)
The operator \( \sigma_x \) has eigenstates \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), but since \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are not eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \), we compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \) directly using:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle.
\]
Expanding \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \), the expectation value becomes:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = a^* b + b^* a,
\]
where \( a = 0.5 \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \). Since \( a \) and \( b \) are real:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2ab = 2 \cdot 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866.
\]
The expectation value of \( 5\sigma_x \) is:
\[
\langle 5\sigma_x \rangle = 5 \cdot \langle \sigma_x \rangle = 5 \cdot 0.866 \approx 4.33.
\]

### 3. Total Expectation Value
Adding the contributions from \( 10\sigma_z \) and \( 5\sigma_x \):
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = \langle 10\sigma_z \rangle + \langle 5\sigma_x \rangle = -5 + 4.33 \approx -0.67.
\]
Rounded to one decimal place, this is \( -0.7 \).

### Final Answer
The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is closest to **-0.7**, which corresponds to option **C**.
