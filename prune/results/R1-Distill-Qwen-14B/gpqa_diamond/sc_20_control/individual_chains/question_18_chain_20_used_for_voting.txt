Okay, so I have this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question gives me some data about the stars. Both have masses larger than our Sun, but I'm not sure if that affects the elemental abundances directly. The main data is about the [X/Y] abundances, which I remember are logarithmic ratios of the elements compared to the Sun.

So, Star_1 has [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. And its [Fe/H]_1 is 0, meaning the iron abundance relative to hydrogen is the same as the Sun. Wait, [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (nFe/nH) divided by the Sun's (nFe/nH), right? So if [Fe/H] is 0, then Star_1 has the same Fe/H ratio as the Sun.

Similarly, Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex and [Mg/H]_2 = 0. So for Star_2, Mg/H is the same as the Sun, but Mg/Si is higher by 0.3 dex.

The photospheric composition of the Sun is given: 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5. Oh wait, wait! No, wait, the notation is a bit confusing. Oh, no, wait: the formula is 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. So that's the Sun's value. Let me compute the Sun's nFe/nH.

Wait, 12 + log(nFe/nH) = 7.5. So log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. Then nFe/nH is 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5. But wait, the Sun's photosphere has these values. But for the stars, these are their [X/Y] ratios.

Wait, but I'm trying to find the ratio of silicon in Star_1 and Star_2. Let me think about what [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si] mean.

The [X/Fe] notation is the logarithm (base 10) of (X/Fe)_star divided by (X/Fe)_sun. So [X/Fe] = log( (n_X/n_Fe)_star / (n_X/n_Fe)_sun )

Similarly, [Mg/Si] is log( (n_Mg/n_Si)_star / (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun )

But wait, wait, no. Actually, the [X/Y] notation is log10 (n_X / n_Y)_star - log10 (n_X/n_Y)_sun. So it's the logarithm of the ratio of the star's abundance to the Sun's.

So for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So (n_Si/n_Fe)_1 = (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun * 10^0.3.

Also, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, so (n_Fe/n_H)_1 = (n_Fe/n_H)_sun. Let's compute that.

Wait, Sun's [Fe/H] is 7.5 - 12 = -4.5. Wait, no, the given Sun's data is 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So log10(nFe/nH) is 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.

So for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, so (n_Fe/n_H)_1 = (n_Fe/n_H)_sun =3.16e-5.

That's Star_1. Now, let's find n_Si/n_H for Star_1.

Wait, how?

We know [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3, so (n_Si/n_Fe)_1 = (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun * 10^0.3.

What is (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun? Let's compute that.

From the Sun's data, we have n_Fe/n_H =3.16e-5. But n_Si is something else. Wait, but the problem doesn't give us the Sun's [Si/Fe]. Hmm. Wait, maybe I can compute it from the given data.

Wait, the Sun's [Fe/H] is given as 12 + log(nFe/nH)=7.5, so nFe/nH is 3.16e-5. But to find n_Si/nFe in the Sun, I would need the solar [Si/Fe], but that's not given. Alternatively, maybe I can express everything in terms of the solar values.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to express everything in terms of solar abundances.

Let me think.

For Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → (n_Si/n_Fe)_1 = 10^0.3 (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun.

But (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun is [Si/Fe]_sun = 0, since for the Sun, [X/Y]_sun is zero. Wait, no. Wait, [X/Y]_sun is log10((n_X/n_Y)_sun / (n_X/n_Y)_sun ) = 0. So [Si/Fe]_sun is 0.

Wait, then [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → (n_Si/n_Fe)_1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun. But since (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun is 10^0, that factor is 1. So (n_Si/n_Fe)_1 = 10^0.3 ≈ 2. So Star_1 has silicon to iron ratio higher than the Sun.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps [Si/Fe]_1 = log10( (n_Si/n_Fe)_1 / (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun ) ) = 0.3. So that means (n_Si/n_Fe)_1 = (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun * 10^0.3.

But without knowing (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun, can I proceed? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can express n_Si in terms of n_Fe, then n_Fe in terms of n_H, and then find n_Si/n_H.

Because for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, so n_Fe/n_H = n_Fe,sun / n_H,sun. Let me denote the Sun's values as n_X_sun for each element X.

So for Star_1:

n_Fe,1 / n_H,1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun = 3.16e-5.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → (n_Si,1 / n_Fe,1) = 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun).

Let me compute 10^0.3. 10^0.3 is approximately 2 (since 10^0.3010 is about 2). So 10^0.3 ≈ 2.

So n_Si,1 = n_Fe,1 * 2 * (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun).

But n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun is (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun, which I don't have. So perhaps I can express n_Si in terms of n_H.

Wait, in Star_1, n_Si = (n_Si/n_Fe)_1 * n_Fe,1.

So n_Si,1 = (n_Si/n_Fe)_1 * n_Fe,1.

But n_Fe,1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H,1.

So n_Si,1 = (n_Si/n_Fe)_1 * (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H,1.

So, n_Si,1 = (10^0.3 * n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) * (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) ) * n_H,1.

Wait, the n_Fe_sun cancels out. So n_Si,1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H,1.

But (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun) is a solar quantity. Let me denote that as (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun) = x.

So n_Si,1 = 10^0.3 * x * n_H,1.

Wait, but n_H,1 is the number of hydrogen atoms in Star_1. Hmm, but without knowing the total number of particles, how can I find the ratio of silicon to hydrogen? Oh wait, but the problem is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2. So perhaps I can compute (n_Si,1 / n_H,1) and (n_Si,2 / n_H,2), then take their ratio.

Because (n_Si,1 / n_H,1) = 10^0.3 * x.

Similarly, for Star_2, I can compute (n_Si,2 / n_H,2) and then find their ratio.

Wait, but I need to find the ratio (n_Si,1 / n_H,1) divided by (n_Si,2 / n_H,2) ), or the other way around? Wait, the question says, "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So I think it's (n_Si,1) / (n_Si,2).

Wait, no, the ratio is [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si], so perhaps it's (n_Si,1 / n_Si,2) ?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says, "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So that's (n_Si,1) / (n_Si,2) )? Or is it (n_Si,1 / n_H,1) divided by (n_Si,2 / n_H,2), which would be (n_Si,1/n_Si,2) * (n_H,2/n_H,1), which I don't know. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is (n_Si,1 / n_H,1) divided by (n_Si,2 / n_H,2) ) → (n_Si,1/n_Si,2) * (n_H,2/n_H,1). But without knowing n_H,1 and n_H,2, perhaps we can assume that n_H is the same in both stars? No, that's not correct because the stars have different masses and perhaps different temperatures, but I don't think we can make that assumption.

Wait, perhaps the stars' overall composition is such that the H abundance is the same as the Sun? Wait, for Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0, which means that the Fe/H ratio is the same as the Sun. But H is the main component; perhaps the overall H abundance is the same as Sun? Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of hydrogen in each star is the same as in the Sun.

Wait, maybe I can proceed by assuming that the H content (n_H) is the same in both stars as in the Sun. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the [M/H] (metallicity) is zero for both stars, but that's not the case. Wait, no, Star_1's [Fe/H] is 0, but for Star_2, what's [Fe/H]? The question doesn't give it, so perhaps it's zero as well, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can proceed without knowing n_H,1 and n_H,2, but only focus on the ratios relative to Fe and Mg.

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's write down all the given data in terms of [X/Y] notation.

For Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → (n_Si/n_Fe)_1 = (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun * 10^0.3.

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → (n_Fe/n_H)_1 = (n_Fe/n_H)_sun.

For Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → (n_Mg/n_Si)_2 = (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun * 10^0.3.

[Mg/H]_2 = 0 → (n_Mg/n_H)_2 = (n_Mg/n_H)_sun.

The problem also gives the Sun's photospheric composition: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5 ≈ 3.16e-5.

Similarly, for Mg, the Sun has 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log10(nMg/nH) = 7 -12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me make sure. The problem statement says:

"Consider the following photospheric composition for the Sun: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7."

So, for Fe: 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.

Similarly, for Mg: 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5.

So, in the Sun:

n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun = 3.16e-5 → n_Fe_sun = 3.16e-5 * n_H_sun.

n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun = 1e-5 → n_Mg_sun = 1e-5 * n_H_sun.

Hmm. Now, let's get back to Star_1 and Star_2.

For Star_1, [Fe/H]_1=0 → n_Fe,1 /n_H,1 = n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun =3.16e-5.

And [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → (n_Si,1 /n_Fe,1) = 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun).

But n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun is (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun. But I don't know that ratio. Hmm, maybe I can express n_Si,1 in terms of n_H,1.

Wait, n_Si,1 = (n_Si,1 /n_Fe,1) * n_Fe,1.

But n_Fe,1 = 3.16e-5 *n_H,1.

So,

n_Si,1 = (10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun )) * (3.16e-5 *n_H,1 )

But n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun is a solar quantity. Let me denote that as S.

So S = n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun.

Similarly, for Star_1,

n_Si,1 = 10^0.3 * S * 3.16e-5 *n_H,1.

So, n_Si,1 = (10^0.3 * 3.16e-5 * S) * n_H,1.

But I don't know S. Hmm. Wait, but maybe I can compute S from the solar data.

Wait, in the Sun, n_Fe/n_H =3.16e-5, and n_Mg/n_H =1e-5.

So, n_Mg/n_Fe = (1e-5) / (3.16e-5) ) ≈ 0.316.

So, the Sun has [Mg/Fe] = log(0.316 / 1) ≈ log(0.316) ≈ -0.5.

Wait, but that's just an aside. Let's get back.

I need n_Si/n_Fe for the Sun. But the problem doesn't give me [Si/Fe]_sun, so perhaps I have to assume it's zero, but that's not correct because [X/Fe]_sun is zero for all X, but that's only if the Sun's composition is such that X/Fe is the same as the Sun. Wait, no, [X/Fe] measures the relative abundance compared to the Sun. So for the Sun, [X/Fe]_sun is zero for all X, because it's the reference.

Wait, so [Si/Fe]_sun = 0 → (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun = 1.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think about this. The [X/Fe] notation is defined as log10( (n_X/n_Fe)_{star} / (n_X/n_Fe)_{sun} ) ).

So for the Sun, this is log(1) = 0. So [X/Fe]_sun is zero for all X, including Si.

So, for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → (n_Si/n_Fe)_1 =10^0.3 * (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun = 10^0.3 * 1 = 2.

So, n_Si,1 = 2 * n_Fe,1.

But n_Fe,1 =3.16e-5 *n_H,1.

So, n_Si,1 = 2 *3.16e-5 *n_H,1 =6.32e-5 *n_H,1.

Similarly, for Star_2, let's compute n_Si,2.

We know [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → (n_Mg/n_Si)_2 =10^0.3 * (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun.

But (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun is (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun = (1e-5) / (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun )).

Wait, no. Wait, in the Sun, n_Mg =1e-5 *n_H_sun, and n_Si_sun is something we don't know. Hmm, this seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can find (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun from the given data.

Wait, in the Sun, n_Mg/n_H =1e-5.

n_Si/n_H in the Sun can be found from the solar data.

Wait, the problem gives the Sun's [Fe/H] and [Mg/H], but not [Si/H]. Hmm. So perhaps I can find n_Si_sun from the solar data.

Wait, the problem gives 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → nFe/nH =1e-4.5.

But I don't have n_Si/nH for the Sun. So perhaps I can't proceed that way.

Wait, maybe I can make an assumption. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the ratio in terms of the Sun's [Si/H], but it's unclear.

Wait, perhaps I can compute [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2, then take their ratio.

Wait, [Si/H]_1 is log( (n_Si,1/n_H,1) / (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) )

But I don't know n_Si_sun/n_H_sun, so perhaps that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is to find the ratio (n_Si,1 /n_H,1) divided by (n_Si,2 /n_H,2), which would be the ratio of the silicon to hydrogen in each star.

But I don't have enough data unless I can find (n_Si,1 /n_H,1) and (n_Si,2 /n_H,2) in terms of the Sun's data.

Wait, let me try for Star_2 first.

Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → (n_Mg/n_Si)_2 =10^0.3 * (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun.

Also, [Mg/H]_2 =0 → (n_Mg/n_H)_2 = (n_Mg/n_H)_sun =1e-5.

So, n_Mg,2 =1e-5 *n_H,2.

But (n_Mg/n_Si)_2 =10^0.3 * (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun.

But (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun is (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun).

Wait, but I don't know n_Si_sun. Hmm. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express n_Si,2 in terms of n_Mg,2.

n_Si,2 = n_Mg,2 / (10^0.3 * (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun )

But n_Mg,2 =1e-5 *n_H,2.

So,

n_Si,2 = (1e-5 *n_H,2) / (10^0.3 * (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun )

But (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun = (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun) = (1e-5 *n_H_sun) / (n_Si_sun)

Hmm, but I don't know n_Si_sun or n_H_sun.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this too complicated. Let me think about the ratio between Star_1 and Star_2.

The ratio we're looking for is (n_Si,1 /n_Si,2 ).

But I can express both n_Si,1 and n_Si,2 in terms of n_H.

n_Si,1 =2 * n_Fe,1 =2 * (3.16e-5 *n_H,1 )

n_Si,1 =6.32e-5 *n_H,1.

For Star_2, let's express n_Si,2 in terms of n_H,2.

From Star_2's [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → (n_Mg/n_Si)_2 = 10^0.3 * (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun.

But (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun is (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun) = (1e-5 *n_H_sun) / (n_Si_sun).

But again, I'm stuck because I don't know n_Si_sun.

Wait, perhaps I can express n_Si,2 in terms of n_Mg,2 and the solar ratio.

Wait, n_Si,2 = n_Mg,2 / (10^0.3 * (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun )

But n_Mg,2 =1e-5 *n_H,2.

So,

n_Si,2 = (1e-5 *n_H,2 ) / (10^0.3 * (1e-5 *n_H_sun) /n_Si_sun )

Wait, that would be:

n_Si,2 = (1e-5 *n_H,2 ) * n_Si_sun / (10^0.3 *1e-5 *n_H_sun )

Simplify numerator and denominator: 1e-5 cancels.

n_Si,2 = (n_H,2 * n_Si_sun ) / (10^0.3 * n_H_sun )

But n_Si_sun is the number of silicon atoms in the Sun relative to H. Wait, but without knowing n_Si_sun, I can't proceed numerically.

Wait, perhaps there's another approach. Let me think about the relations again.

For Star_1:

n_Si,1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun) *n_Fe,1.

But n_Fe,1 = (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H,1.

So,

n_Si,1 =10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun) * (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun) ) *n_H,1.

Which simplifies to:

n_Si,1 =10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H,1.

Similarly, for Star_2, n_Si,2 is:

n_Si,2 = n_Mg,2 / (10^0.3 * (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun) )

But n_Mg,2 = (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun) ) *n_H,2.

So,

n_Si,2 = (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun ) *n_H,2 / (10^0.3 * (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun) )

Wait, this can be rewritten as:

n_Si,2 = (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun ) *n_H,2 * n_Si_sun / (10^0.3 * n_Mg_sun )

The n_Mg_sun terms cancel.

n_Si,2 = (n_H,2 /n_H_sun) * n_Si_sun / (10^0.3 )

But n_Si_sun /n_H_sun is (n_Si/n_H)_sun, which is [Si/H]_sun = log10( (n_Si/n_H)_sun / (n_Si/n_H)_sun ) → [Si/H]_sun is zero. No, wait, [Si/H]_sun is log10( (n_Si/n_H)_sun / (n_Si/n_H)_sun ) =0, which doesn't help.

Wait, but I can compute (n_Si/n_H)_sun using the Sun's data. Because the Sun's data gives n_Fe/n_H =3.16e-5 and n_Mg/n_H=1e-5. But what about n_Si/n_H? Hmm, the problem doesn't give that, so perhaps I can't proceed.

Wait, but perhaps the ratio of n_Si,1 and n_Si,2 can be expressed in terms of n_H,1 and n_H,2.

Wait, n_Si,1 =10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H,1.

n_Si,2 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H,2 / (10^0.3 )

So the ratio n_Si,1 / n_Si,2 = [10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H,1 ] / [ (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H,2 / 10^0.3 ]

The (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) terms cancel.

So,

n_Si,1 / n_Si,2 = [10^0.3 *n_H,1 ] / [n_H,2/(10^0.3) ] = (10^0.3 *n_H,1 *10^0.3 ) / n_H,2 = (10^(0.6) *n_H,1 ) /n_H,2.

Hmm, but I don't know n_H,1 and n_H,2.

Wait, but perhaps I can relate n_H,1 and n_H,2 using other parameters.

Wait, both stars have [Fe/H] of 0 and [Mg/H] of 0. Wait, Star_1 has [Fe/H]=0, but Star_2 has [Mg/H]=0, but not necessarily [Fe/H]=0.

Wait, the question says for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2 =0. So (n_Mg,2 /n_H,2 ) = (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun )=1e-5.

But I don't know Star_2's [Fe/H], only [Mg/H]. Hmm.

Wait, Star_1's [Fe/H]=0, so (n_Fe,1/n_H,1 )=3.16e-5.

But for Star_2, [Fe/H] isn't given, so we can't say anything about (n_Fe,2/n_H,2 ). Hmm.

But perhaps I can find the ratio n_H,1 and n_H,2 using the masses of the stars. Wait, but the question gives the masses as 1.5 and 1.2 solar masses, but I'm not sure if that's relevant. Because the mass of a star doesn't directly tell us about the abundance of elements unless we know about other factors like formation history, but this problem seems to focus on photospheric abundances, so perhaps mass isn't directly relevant here.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should think differently. Let me try to write down the expressions again.

For Star_1:

n_Si,1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun) *n_Fe,1.

But n_Fe,1 =3.16e-5 *n_H,1.

So,

n_Si,1 =10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun ) *3.16e-5 *n_H,1.

Similarly, for Star_2:

n_Si,2 = (n_Mg,2 / (10^0.3 * (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun) )).

But n_Mg,2 =1e-5 *n_H,2.

So,

n_Si,2 = (1e-5 *n_H,2) / (10^0.3 * (1e-5 / (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun )) )

Wait,

= (1e-5 *n_H,2) * (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) / (10^0.3 *1e-5 )

The 1e-5 cancels.

= (n_H,2 *n_Si_sun ) / (10^0.3 *n_H_sun )

So,

n_Si,2 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) *n_H,2 /10^0.3.

Now, the ratio n_Si,1/n_Si,2 is:

[10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun ) *3.16e-5 *n_H,1 ] / [ (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) *n_H,2 / 10^0.3 ]

Hmm, this seems complicated, but let's substitute n_Si_sun /n_H_sun as (n_Si/n_H)_sun.

Wait, but I don't know that value. Alternatively, perhaps I can relate n_Si_sun and n_Fe_sun.

In the Sun, n_Fe/n_H =3.16e-5.

But n_Si_sun is (n_Si/n_H)_sun *n_H_sun = x *n_H_sun, where x is (n_Si/n_H)_sun.

Wait, so n_Si_sun =x *n_H_sun.

n_Fe_sun =3.16e-5 *n_H_sun.

So,

n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun = (x *n_H_sun ) / (3.16e-5 *n_H_sun ) = x /3.16e-5.

So,

n_Si,1 =10^0.3 * (x /3.16e-5 ) *3.16e-5 *n_H,1.

The 3.16e-5 terms cancel.

n_Si,1 =10^0.3 *x *n_H,1.

Similarly, n_Si,2 = (x *n_H_sun )/(10^0.3 *n_H_sun ) *n_H,2 =x *n_H,2 /10^0.3.

So,

n_Si,1 =10^0.3 x n_H,1,

n_Si,2 =x n_H,2 /10^0.3.

So, the ratio:

n_Si,1 /n_Si,2 = (10^0.3 x n_H,1 ) / (x n_H,2 /10^0.3 ) )

The x cancels.

= (10^0.3 *10^0.3 ) * (n_H,1 /n_H,2 )

= 10^0.6 * (n_H,1 /n_H,2 )

Hmm, but I don't know the ratio of n_H,1 to n_H,2.

Wait, unless I can find n_H,1 and n_H,2 in terms of the stars' abundances.

Wait, but the problem doesn't give me any other data that relates the H content of the stars. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the ratio of n_H,1 and n_H,2 can be found from the fact that [Fe/H]_1 is 0 and [Mg/H]_2 is 0.

Wait, for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1=0 → (n_Fe,1/n_H,1 ) = (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun )=3.16e-5.

But I don't know if Star_2 has [Fe/H]=0. The problem only states [Mg/H]_2=0.

So,

Star_2: (n_Mg,2 /n_H,2 )= (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun )=1e-5.

But for Star_2, I don't know (n_Fe,2/n_H,2 ), so I can't directly relate n_H,2 to anything else.

Hmm. This seems like a dead end. Maybe I need to make an assumption that the H content is the same in both stars, but that's probably not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of H doesn't affect the final answer, which is the ratio of Si in the two stars. But I'm not seeing it.

Wait, let me think about the problem again. The question is about the ratio of Si atoms in the two stars, so maybe it's a ratio of their [Si/H] values.

Wait, [Si/H]_1 = log( (n_Si,1 /n_H,1 ) / (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) )

Similarly, [Si/H]_2 = log( (n_Si,2 /n_H,2 ) / (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) )

So,

[Si/H]_1 = log( (n_Si,1 /n_H,1 ) ) - log( n_Si_sun /n_H_sun )

But perhaps without knowing the Sun's [Si/H], I can't proceed.

Wait, but maybe I can find [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2 in terms of the given data.

Wait, for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 and [Fe/H]_1=0.

[Fe/H]_1=0 → [Fe/H]_1 = log( (n_Fe,1/n_H,1 ) / (n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun )) =0 → (n_Fe,1/n_H,1 )= (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun )=3.16e-5.

[Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → [Si/Fe]_1 = log( (n_Si,1/n_Fe,1 ) / (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun )) )=0.3.

So,

n_Si,1/n_Fe,1 =10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun )

But n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun is (n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun ) = (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun.

But [Si/Fe]_sun is 0 → (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun =1.

So,

n_Si,1/n_Fe,1 =10^0.3 =2.

Thus, n_Si,1=2 * n_Fe,1.

But n_Fe,1 =3.16e-5 *n_H,1.

So, n_Si,1 =2 *3.16e-5 *n_H,1=6.32e-5 *n_H,1.

So, [Si/H]_1 = log( (6.32e-5 *n_H,1 ) /n_H,1 ) = log(6.32e-5 )= log(6.32) + log(1e-5 )= ~0.8 + (-5) = -4.2.

Wait, that's [Si/H]_1 = -4.2.

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → (n_Mg,2/n_Si,2 ) =10^0.3 * (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun )=2 * (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun ).

[Si/H]_2 = log( (n_Si,2 /n_H,2 ) / (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun ) )

But I need to find [Si/H]_2.

Wait, let's find n_Si,2 in terms of n_H,2.

n_Mg,2 =1e-5 *n_H,2.

From [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → n_Mg,2 =10^0.3 * (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun ) *n_Si,2.

So,

1e-5 *n_H,2 = 2 * (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun ) *n_Si,2.

But (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun ) = (n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun )/(n_Si_sun/n_H_sun ) )= (1e-5 )/(n_Si_sun/n_H_sun ).

Hmm, but I don't know n_Si_sun/n_H_sun, which is [Si/H]_sun. Let me call that Y.

So,

n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun = (1e-5 ) / Y.

So,

1e-5 *n_H,2 = 2 * (1e-5/Y) *n_Si,2.

Cancel 1e-5:

n_H,2 = 2 * (1/Y) *n_Si,2 → n_Si,2 = (Y/2) *n_H,2.

So,

n_Si,2 = (Y/2) *n_H,2.

Thus, [Si/H]_2 = log( (n_Si,2 /n_H,2 ) ) - log(Y) = log(Y/2) - log(Y) = log(1/2 )= -0.3.

Wait, that's interesting. So [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

Wait, but wait: [Si/H]_2 is log( (n_Si,2/n_H,2 )/(n_Si_sun/n_H_sun )) ) = log( (Y/2) / Y ) )= log(1/2 )= -0.3.

Yes, that makes sense. So [Si/H]_2 =-0.3.

Wait, but I'm not sure if I did that correctly. Let me recalculate.

n_Si,2 = (Y/2) n_H,2.

So,

n_Si,2 /n_H,2 = Y/2.

The Sun's [Si/H] is log(Y) = [Si/H]_sun = 0 → Y=10^0=1.

Wait, no! Because [X/H]_sun is zero for all elements, so Y =n_Si_sun /n_H_sun =10^0=1.

Ah, that's a key point. So, Y=1.

So,

n_Si,2 = (1/2 ) *n_H,2.

Thus, [Si/H]_2 = log( (n_Si,2 /n_H,2 ) / (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun )) ) = log( (0.5 *n_H,2 /n_H,2 ) / 1 )= log(0.5 )= -0.3.

Yes, that's correct.

Similarly, for Star_1, [Si/H]_1 = log( (6.32e-5 *n_H,1 )/n_H,1 ) = log(6.32e-5 )= log(6.32) + log(1e-5 )= approx 0.8 + (-5 )= -4.2.

So, [Si/H]_1 =-4.2.

But wait, the problem is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the two stars. So, the question is what is (n_Si,1 /n_Si,2 )?

But I can express each [Si/H] in terms of their respective stars' H abundance.

n_Si,1 =10^([Si/H]_1 + log(n_Si_sun/n_H_sun )) *n_H,1.

But since [Si/H]_sun is 0, n_Si_sun/n_H_sun =1 → [Si/H] is log(n_Si/n_H).

Wait, no, [Si/H] = log10( (n_Si/n_H)_{star} / (n_Si/n_H)_{sun} )= log10( (n_Si/n_H)_{star} ) - log10( (n_Si/n_H)_{sun} )

Since (n_Si/n_H)_{sun}=1, [Si/H] = log10(n_Si/n_H)_{star}.

So, for Star_1:

[Si/H]_1 = log10(n_Si,1 /n_H,1 ) = -4.2 → n_Si,1/n_H,1 =10^-4.2 ≈6.3e-5.

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Si/H]_2 = log10(n_Si,2/n_H,2 )= -0.3 →n_Si,2/n_H,2 =10^-0.3 ≈0.5.

So, the ratio (n_Si,1/n_Si,2 ) is (n_Si,1/n_H,1 ) * (n_H,2/n_Si,2 )= (6.3e-5) * (n_H,2/(0.5 *n_H,2 )) )= (6.3e-5) * (1/0.5 )= 6.3e-5 *2=1.26e-4.

Wait, that can't be right. Because that would imply that Star_1 has less silicon than Star_2, but the given [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3, which suggests more Si relative to Fe. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, no, wait. Let's clarify.

The ratio is (n_Si,1 /n_Si,2 ) = (n_Si,1/n_H,1 ) * (n_H,2/n_Si,2 ).

But,

n_Si,1/n_H,1 =10^([Si/H]_1 ) =10^(-4.2 )=6.3e-5.

n_Si,2/n_H,2 =10^(-0.3 )=0.5.

So,

n_Si,1/n_Si,2 = (6.3e-5 /0.5 ) * (n_H,2 /n_H,1 )

Wait, but I don't know the ratio of n_H,2 to n_H,1.

Hmm. This is the crux of the problem. Without knowing how the hydrogen abundance changes between the stars, I can't directly find the ratio of silicon atoms.

Wait, but perhaps I can relate n_H,1 and n_H,2 using their iron abundances.

Wait, Star_1 has [Fe/H]=0, so (n_Fe,1 /n_H,1 )= (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun )=3.16e-5.

Star_2's [Fe/H] is not given, so I can't say anything about (n_Fe,2 /n_H,2 ). Hmm.

But perhaps I can find the ratio n_H,1 /n_H,2 using the fact that the stars have different masses, but I'm not sure how that relates to their photospheric composition.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the overall H content is the same in both stars, but I don't think that's a valid assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved without considering the H ratio, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: perhaps the ratio of silicon atoms is (n_Si,1 /n_Si,2 ) = (6.3e-5 ) / (0.5 )= 1.26e-4 → 0.000126, which isn't one of the options. So I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the ratio of [Si/H]_1 to [Si/H]_2.

Wait, [Si/H]_1 =-4.2, [Si/H]_2 =-0.3.

The ratio would be 10^(-4.2 ) /10^(-0.3 )=10^(-3.9 )≈1.26e-4, which is the same as before.

But that's a very small ratio, and the options don't include anything that small. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the ratio as [n_Si,1 /n_Si,2 ] = (n_Si,1 /n_H,1 ) * (n_H,2 /n_Si,2 )).

But without knowing the ratio of n_H,1 to n_H,2, I can't compute this.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the hydrogen abundance is the same in both stars, which would make the ratio (n_Si,1/n_Si,2 ) = (6.3e-5 ) / 0.5 = 1.26e-4, but that's not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is (n_Si,1 /n_Si,2 ) = (6.3e-5 ) / (0.5 )=1.26e-4 → 0.000126.

But none of the options match that. So I must have made a wrong assumption somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this using only the given [X/Y] values without considering the absolute abundances.

Another approach: let's express the silicon abundance in each star as a fraction of hydrogen.

For Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(n_Si/n_Fe)_1 =0.3 → n_Si,1 =n_Fe,1 *10^0.3.

[Fe/H]_1=0 →n_Fe,1 = (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun ) *n_H,1.

n_Fe_sun =3.16e-5 *n_H_sun.

So,

n_Si,1 =3.16e-5 *n_H,1 *10^0.3.

Similarly,

n_Si,1 =3.16e-5 *2 *n_H,1 ≈6.32e-5 *n_H,1.

For Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → log(n_Mg/n_Si)_2 =0.3 →n_Mg,2 =n_Si,2 *10^0.3.

[Mg/H]_2=0 →n_Mg,2 = (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun ) *n_H,2 =1e-5 *n_H,2.

So,

1e-5 *n_H,2 =n_Si,2 *10^0.3 →n_Si,2 = (1e-5 *n_H,2 )/10^0.3 =1e-5 *n_H,2 /2 ≈5e-6 *n_H,2.

Now, to find the ratio of n_Si,1 to n_Si,2:

n_Si,1 /n_Si,2 = (6.32e-5 *n_H,1 ) / (5e-6 *n_H,2 ) )= (6.32e-5 /5e-6 ) * (n_H,1/n_H,2 )

= (12.64 ) * (n_H,1/n_H,2 )

But without knowing the ratio of n_H,1 to n_H,2, I can't proceed.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the hydrogen abundance is the same in both stars. If that's the case, then n_H,1 =n_H,2 → ratio=12.64.

Looking at the options, option B is ~12.6, which matches this.

But why would the hydrogen be the same in both stars? They have different masses, so their overall hydrogen content would vary. However, perhaps in the photosphere, the H abundance is normalized in a way that makes this assumption valid.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects this approach, so the answer is approximately 12.6, option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the provided data to compute the silicon-to-hydrogen ratio ([Si/H]) for each star. The ratio of silicon atoms in the two stars is then derived from these values.

   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex → \( \log_{10} \left( \frac{n_{\text{Si},1}}{n_{\text{Fe},1}} \right) = 0.3 \)
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex → \( \frac{n_{\text{Fe},1}}{n_{\text{H},1}} = \frac{n_{\text{Fe,sun}}}{n_{\text{H,sun}}} = 3.16 \times 10^{-5} \)

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex → \( \log_{10} \left( \frac{n_{\text{Mg},2}}{n_{\text{Si},2}} \right) = 0.3 \)
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex → \( \frac{n_{\text{Mg},2}}{n_{\text{H},2}} = \frac{n_{\text{Mg,sun}}}{n_{\text{H,sun}}} = 1 \times 10^{-5} \)

3. **Solar Photospheric Composition**:

   - \( 12 + \log_{10} \left( \frac{n_{\text{Mg,sun}}}{n_{\text{H,sun}}} \right) = 7 \) → \( \frac{n_{\text{Mg,sun}}}{n_{\text{H,sun}}} = 1 \times 10^{-5} \)

### **Analysis**
#### **Star_1**:
1. From [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3:
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{Si},1}}{n_{\text{Fe},1}} = 10^{0.3} \approx 2
   \]
2. From [Fe/H]_1 = 0:
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{Fe},1}}{n_{\text{H},1}} = 3.16 \times 10^{-5}
   \]
   Substituting \( n_{\text{Fe},1} = 3.16 \times 10^{-5} \cdot n_{\text{H},1} \) into the previous equation:
   \[
   n_{\text{Si},1} = 2 \cdot n_{\text{Fe},1} = 2 \cdot (3.16 \times 10^{-5} \cdot n_{\text{H},1}) = 6.32 \times 10^{-5} \cdot n_{\text{H},1}
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{Si},1}}{n_{\text{H},1}} = 6.32 \times 10^{-5}
   \]

#### **Star_2**:
1. From [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3:
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{Mg},2}}{n_{\text{Si},2}} = 10^{0.3} \approx 2
   \]
2. From [Mg/H]_2 = 0:
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{Mg},2}}{n_{\text{H},2}} = 1 \times 10^{-5}
   \]
   Substituting \( n_{\text{Mg},2} = 1 \times 10^{-5} \cdot n_{\text{H},2} \) into the previous equation:
   \[
   1 \times 10^{-5} \cdot n_{\text{H},2} = 2 \cdot n_{\text{Si},2}
   \]
   Solving for \( n_{\text{Si},2} \):
   \[
   n_{\text{Si},2} = \frac{1 \times 10^{-5} \cdot n_{\text{H},2}}{2} = 5 \times 10^{-6} \cdot n_{\text{H},2}
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{Si},2}}{n_{\text{H},2}} = 5 \times 10^{-6}
   \]

#### **Ratio of Silicon Atoms**:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the two stars is:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si},1}}{n_{\text{Si},2}} = \frac{\frac{n_{\text{Si},1}}{n_{\text{H},1}}}{\frac{n_{\text{Si},2}}{n_{\text{H},2}}} = \frac{6.32 \times 10^{-5}}{5 \times 10^{-6}} = 12.64
\]

---

### **Conclusion**
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **12.6**.

**Answer: B**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question gives me some data about the stars. Both have masses larger than our Sun, but I'm not sure if that affects the elemental abundances directly. The main data is about the [X/Y] abundances, which I remember are logarithmic ratios of the elements compared to the Sun.

So, Star_1 has [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. And its [Fe/H]_1 is 0, meaning the iron abundance relative to hydrogen is the same as the Sun. Wait, [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (nFe/nH) divided by the Sun's (nFe/nH), right? So if [Fe/H] is 0, then Star_1 has the same Fe/H ratio as the Sun.

Similarly, Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex and [Mg/H]_2 = 0. So for Star_2, Mg/H is the same as the Sun, but Mg/Si is higher by 0.3 dex.

The photospheric composition of the Sun is given: 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5. Oh wait, wait! No, wait, the notation is a bit confusing. Oh, no, wait: the formula is 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. So that's the Sun's value. Let me compute the Sun's nFe/nH.

Wait, 12 + log(nFe/nH) = 7.5. So log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. Then nFe/nH is 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5. But wait, the Sun's photosphere has these values. But for the stars, these are their [X/Y] ratios.

Wait, but I'm trying to find the ratio of silicon in Star_1 and Star_2. Let me think about what [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si] mean.

The [X/Fe] notation is the logarithm (base 10) of (X/Fe)_star divided by (X/Fe)_sun. So [X/Fe] = log( (n_X/n_Fe)_star / (n_X/n_Fe)_sun )

Similarly, [Mg/Si] is log( (n_Mg/n_Si)_star / (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun )

But wait, wait, no. Actually, the [X/Y] notation is log10 (n_X / n_Y)_star - log10 (n_X/n_Y)_sun. So it's the logarithm of the ratio of the star's abundance to the Sun's.

So for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So (n_Si/n_Fe)_1 = (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun * 10^0.3.

Also, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, so (n_Fe/n_H)_1 = (n_Fe/n_H)_sun. Let's compute that.

Wait, Sun's [Fe/H] is 7.5 - 12 = -4.5. Wait, no, the given Sun's data is 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So log10(nFe/nH) is 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.

So for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, so (n_Fe/n_H)_1 = (n_Fe/n_H)_sun =3.16e-5.

That's Star_1. Now, let's find n_Si/n_H for Star_1.

Wait, how?

We know [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3, so (n_Si/n_Fe)_1 = (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun * 10^0.3.

What is (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun? Let's compute that.

From the Sun's data, we have n_Fe/n_H =3.16e-5. But n_Si is something else. Wait, but the problem doesn't give us the Sun's [Si/Fe]. Hmm. Wait, maybe I can compute it from the given data.

Wait, the Sun's [Fe/H] is given as 12 + log(nFe/nH)=7.5, so nFe/nH is 3.16e-5. But to find n_Si/nFe in the Sun, I would need the solar [Si/Fe], but that's not given. Alternatively, maybe I can express everything in terms of the solar values.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to express everything in terms of solar abundances.

Let me think.

For Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → (n_Si/n_Fe)_1 = 10^0.3 (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun.

But (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun is [Si/Fe]_sun = 0, since for the Sun, [X/Y]_sun is zero. Wait, no. Wait, [X/Y]_sun is log10((n_X/n_Y)_sun / (n_X/n_Y)_sun ) = 0. So [Si/Fe]_sun is 0.

Wait, then [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → (n_Si/n_Fe)_1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun. But since (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun is 10^0, that factor is 1. So (n_Si/n_Fe)_1 = 10^0.3 ≈ 2. So Star_1 has silicon to iron ratio higher than the Sun.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps [Si/Fe]_1 = log10( (n_Si/n_Fe)_1 / (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun ) ) = 0.3. So that means (n_Si/n_Fe)_1 = (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun * 10^0.3.

But without knowing (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun, can I proceed? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can express n_Si in terms of n_Fe, then n_Fe in terms of n_H, and then find n_Si/n_H.

Because for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, so n_Fe/n_H = n_Fe,sun / n_H,sun. Let me denote the Sun's values as n_X_sun for each element X.

So for Star_1:

n_Fe,1 / n_H,1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun = 3.16e-5.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → (n_Si,1 / n_Fe,1) = 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun).

Let me compute 10^0.3. 10^0.3 is approximately 2 (since 10^0.3010 is about 2). So 10^0.3 ≈ 2.

So n_Si,1 = n_Fe,1 * 2 * (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun).

But n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun is (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun, which I don't have. So perhaps I can express n_Si in terms of n_H.

Wait, in Star_1, n_Si = (n_Si/n_Fe)_1 * n_Fe,1.

So n_Si,1 = (n_Si/n_Fe)_1 * n_Fe,1.

But n_Fe,1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H,1.

So n_Si,1 = (n_Si/n_Fe)_1 * (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H,1.

So, n_Si,1 = (10^0.3 * n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) * (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) ) * n_H,1.

Wait, the n_Fe_sun cancels out. So n_Si,1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H,1.

But (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun) is a solar quantity. Let me denote that as (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun) = x.

So n_Si,1 = 10^0.3 * x * n_H,1.

Wait, but n_H,1 is the number of hydrogen atoms in Star_1. Hmm, but without knowing the total number of particles, how can I find the ratio of silicon to hydrogen? Oh wait, but the problem is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2. So perhaps I can compute (n_Si,1 / n_H,1) and (n_Si,2 / n_H,2), then take their ratio.

Because (n_Si,1 / n_H,1) = 10^0.3 * x.

Similarly, for Star_2, I can compute (n_Si,2 / n_H,2) and then find their ratio.

Wait, but I need to find the ratio (n_Si,1 / n_H,1) divided by (n_Si,2 / n_H,2) ), or the other way around? Wait, the question says, "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So I think it's (n_Si,1) / (n_Si,2).

Wait, no, the ratio is [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si], so perhaps it's (n_Si,1 / n_Si,2) ?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says, "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So that's (n_Si,1) / (n_Si,2) )? Or is it (n_Si,1 / n_H,1) divided by (n_Si,2 / n_H,2), which would be (n_Si,1/n_Si,2) * (n_H,2/n_H,1), which I don't know. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is (n_Si,1 / n_H,1) divided by (n_Si,2 / n_H,2) ) → (n_Si,1/n_Si,2) * (n_H,2/n_H,1). But without knowing n_H,1 and n_H,2, perhaps we can assume that n_H is the same in both stars? No, that's not correct because the stars have different masses and perhaps different temperatures, but I don't think we can make that assumption.

Wait, perhaps the stars' overall composition is such that the H abundance is the same as the Sun? Wait, for Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0, which means that the Fe/H ratio is the same as the Sun. But H is the main component; perhaps the overall H abundance is the same as Sun? Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of hydrogen in each star is the same as in the Sun.

Wait, maybe I can proceed by assuming that the H content (n_H) is the same in both stars as in the Sun. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the [M/H] (metallicity) is zero for both stars, but that's not the case. Wait, no, Star_1's [Fe/H] is 0, but for Star_2, what's [Fe/H]? The question doesn't give it, so perhaps it's zero as well, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can proceed without knowing n_H,1 and n_H,2, but only focus on the ratios relative to Fe and Mg.

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's write down all the given data in terms of [X/Y] notation.

For Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → (n_Si/n_Fe)_1 = (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun * 10^0.3.

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → (n_Fe/n_H)_1 = (n_Fe/n_H)_sun.

For Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → (n_Mg/n_Si)_2 = (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun * 10^0.3.

[Mg/H]_2 = 0 → (n_Mg/n_H)_2 = (n_Mg/n_H)_sun.

The problem also gives the Sun's photospheric composition: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5 ≈ 3.16e-5.

Similarly, for Mg, the Sun has 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log10(nMg/nH) = 7 -12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me make sure. The problem statement says:

"Consider the following photospheric composition for the Sun: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7."

So, for Fe: 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.

Similarly, for Mg: 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5.

So, in the Sun:

n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun = 3.16e-5 → n_Fe_sun = 3.16e-5 * n_H_sun.

n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun = 1e-5 → n_Mg_sun = 1e-5 * n_H_sun.

Hmm. Now, let's get back to Star_1 and Star_2.

For Star_1, [Fe/H]_1=0 → n_Fe,1 /n_H,1 = n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun =3.16e-5.

And [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → (n_Si,1 /n_Fe,1) = 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun).

But n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun is (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun. But I don't know that ratio. Hmm, maybe I can express n_Si,1 in terms of n_H,1.

Wait, n_Si,1 = (n_Si,1 /n_Fe,1) * n_Fe,1.

But n_Fe,1 = 3.16e-5 *n_H,1.

So,

n_Si,1 = (10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun )) * (3.16e-5 *n_H,1 )

But n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun is a solar quantity. Let me denote that as S.

So S = n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun.

Similarly, for Star_1,

n_Si,1 = 10^0.3 * S * 3.16e-5 *n_H,1.

So, n_Si,1 = (10^0.3 * 3.16e-5 * S) * n_H,1.

But I don't know S. Hmm. Wait, but maybe I can compute S from the solar data.

Wait, in the Sun, n_Fe/n_H =3.16e-5, and n_Mg/n_H =1e-5.

So, n_Mg/n_Fe = (1e-5) / (3.16e-5) ) ≈ 0.316.

So, the Sun has [Mg/Fe] = log(0.316 / 1) ≈ log(0.316) ≈ -0.5.

Wait, but that's just an aside. Let's get back.

I need n_Si/n_Fe for the Sun. But the problem doesn't give me [Si/Fe]_sun, so perhaps I have to assume it's zero, but that's not correct because [X/Fe]_sun is zero for all X, but that's only if the Sun's composition is such that X/Fe is the same as the Sun. Wait, no, [X/Fe] measures the relative abundance compared to the Sun. So for the Sun, [X/Fe]_sun is zero for all X, because it's the reference.

Wait, so [Si/Fe]_sun = 0 → (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun = 1.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think about this. The [X/Fe] notation is defined as log10( (n_X/n_Fe)_{star} / (n_X/n_Fe)_{sun} ) ).

So for the Sun, this is log(1) = 0. So [X/Fe]_sun is zero for all X, including Si.

So, for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → (n_Si/n_Fe)_1 =10^0.3 * (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun = 10^0.3 * 1 = 2.

So, n_Si,1 = 2 * n_Fe,1.

But n_Fe,1 =3.16e-5 *n_H,1.

So, n_Si,1 = 2 *3.16e-5 *n_H,1 =6.32e-5 *n_H,1.

Similarly, for Star_2, let's compute n_Si,2.

We know [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → (n_Mg/n_Si)_2 =10^0.3 * (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun.

But (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun is (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun = (1e-5) / (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun )).

Wait, no. Wait, in the Sun, n_Mg =1e-5 *n_H_sun, and n_Si_sun is something we don't know. Hmm, this seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can find (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun from the given data.

Wait, in the Sun, n_Mg/n_H =1e-5.

n_Si/n_H in the Sun can be found from the solar data.

Wait, the problem gives the Sun's [Fe/H] and [Mg/H], but not [Si/H]. Hmm. So perhaps I can find n_Si_sun from the solar data.

Wait, the problem gives 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → nFe/nH =1e-4.5.

But I don't have n_Si/nH for the Sun. So perhaps I can't proceed that way.

Wait, maybe I can make an assumption. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the ratio in terms of the Sun's [Si/H], but it's unclear.

Wait, perhaps I can compute [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2, then take their ratio.

Wait, [Si/H]_1 is log( (n_Si,1/n_H,1) / (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) )

But I don't know n_Si_sun/n_H_sun, so perhaps that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is to find the ratio (n_Si,1 /n_H,1) divided by (n_Si,2 /n_H,2), which would be the ratio of the silicon to hydrogen in each star.

But I don't have enough data unless I can find (n_Si,1 /n_H,1) and (n_Si,2 /n_H,2) in terms of the Sun's data.

Wait, let me try for Star_2 first.

Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → (n_Mg/n_Si)_2 =10^0.3 * (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun.

Also, [Mg/H]_2 =0 → (n_Mg/n_H)_2 = (n_Mg/n_H)_sun =1e-5.

So, n_Mg,2 =1e-5 *n_H,2.

But (n_Mg/n_Si)_2 =10^0.3 * (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun.

But (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun is (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun).

Wait, but I don't know n_Si_sun. Hmm. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express n_Si,2 in terms of n_Mg,2.

n_Si,2 = n_Mg,2 / (10^0.3 * (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun )

But n_Mg,2 =1e-5 *n_H,2.

So,

n_Si,2 = (1e-5 *n_H,2) / (10^0.3 * (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun )

But (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun = (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun) = (1e-5 *n_H_sun) / (n_Si_sun)

Hmm, but I don't know n_Si_sun or n_H_sun.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this too complicated. Let me think about the ratio between Star_1 and Star_2.

The ratio we're looking for is (n_Si,1 /n_Si,2 ).

But I can express both n_Si,1 and n_Si,2 in terms of n_H.

n_Si,1 =2 * n_Fe,1 =2 * (3.16e-5 *n_H,1 )

n_Si,1 =6.32e-5 *n_H,1.

For Star_2, let's express n_Si,2 in terms of n_H,2.

From Star_2's [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → (n_Mg/n_Si)_2 = 10^0.3 * (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun.

But (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun is (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun) = (1e-5 *n_H_sun) / (n_Si_sun).

But again, I'm stuck because I don't know n_Si_sun.

Wait, perhaps I can express n_Si,2 in terms of n_Mg,2 and the solar ratio.

Wait, n_Si,2 = n_Mg,2 / (10^0.3 * (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun )

But n_Mg,2 =1e-5 *n_H,2.

So,

n_Si,2 = (1e-5 *n_H,2 ) / (10^0.3 * (1e-5 *n_H_sun) /n_Si_sun )

Wait, that would be:

n_Si,2 = (1e-5 *n_H,2 ) * n_Si_sun / (10^0.3 *1e-5 *n_H_sun )

Simplify numerator and denominator: 1e-5 cancels.

n_Si,2 = (n_H,2 * n_Si_sun ) / (10^0.3 * n_H_sun )

But n_Si_sun is the number of silicon atoms in the Sun relative to H. Wait, but without knowing n_Si_sun, I can't proceed numerically.

Wait, perhaps there's another approach. Let me think about the relations again.

For Star_1:

n_Si,1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun) *n_Fe,1.

But n_Fe,1 = (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H,1.

So,

n_Si,1 =10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun) * (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun) ) *n_H,1.

Which simplifies to:

n_Si,1 =10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H,1.

Similarly, for Star_2, n_Si,2 is:

n_Si,2 = n_Mg,2 / (10^0.3 * (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun) )

But n_Mg,2 = (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun) ) *n_H,2.

So,

n_Si,2 = (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun ) *n_H,2 / (10^0.3 * (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun) )

Wait, this can be rewritten as:

n_Si,2 = (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun ) *n_H,2 * n_Si_sun / (10^0.3 * n_Mg_sun )

The n_Mg_sun terms cancel.

n_Si,2 = (n_H,2 /n_H_sun) * n_Si_sun / (10^0.3 )

But n_Si_sun /n_H_sun is (n_Si/n_H)_sun, which is [Si/H]_sun = log10( (n_Si/n_H)_sun / (n_Si/n_H)_sun ) → [Si/H]_sun is zero. No, wait, [Si/H]_sun is log10( (n_Si/n_H)_sun / (n_Si/n_H)_sun ) =0, which doesn't help.

Wait, but I can compute (n_Si/n_H)_sun using the Sun's data. Because the Sun's data gives n_Fe/n_H =3.16e-5 and n_Mg/n_H=1e-5. But what about n_Si/n_H? Hmm, the problem doesn't give that, so perhaps I can't proceed.

Wait, but perhaps the ratio of n_Si,1 and n_Si,2 can be expressed in terms of n_H,1 and n_H,2.

Wait, n_Si,1 =10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H,1.

n_Si,2 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H,2 / (10^0.3 )

So the ratio n_Si,1 / n_Si,2 = [10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H,1 ] / [ (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H,2 / 10^0.3 ]

The (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) terms cancel.

So,

n_Si,1 / n_Si,2 = [10^0.3 *n_H,1 ] / [n_H,2/(10^0.3) ] = (10^0.3 *n_H,1 *10^0.3 ) / n_H,2 = (10^(0.6) *n_H,1 ) /n_H,2.

Hmm, but I don't know n_H,1 and n_H,2.

Wait, but perhaps I can relate n_H,1 and n_H,2 using other parameters.

Wait, both stars have [Fe/H] of 0 and [Mg/H] of 0. Wait, Star_1 has [Fe/H]=0, but Star_2 has [Mg/H]=0, but not necessarily [Fe/H]=0.

Wait, the question says for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2 =0. So (n_Mg,2 /n_H,2 ) = (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun )=1e-5.

But I don't know Star_2's [Fe/H], only [Mg/H]. Hmm.

Wait, Star_1's [Fe/H]=0, so (n_Fe,1/n_H,1 )=3.16e-5.

But for Star_2, [Fe/H] isn't given, so we can't say anything about (n_Fe,2/n_H,2 ). Hmm.

But perhaps I can find the ratio n_H,1 and n_H,2 using the masses of the stars. Wait, but the question gives the masses as 1.5 and 1.2 solar masses, but I'm not sure if that's relevant. Because the mass of a star doesn't directly tell us about the abundance of elements unless we know about other factors like formation history, but this problem seems to focus on photospheric abundances, so perhaps mass isn't directly relevant here.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should think differently. Let me try to write down the expressions again.

For Star_1:

n_Si,1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun) *n_Fe,1.

But n_Fe,1 =3.16e-5 *n_H,1.

So,

n_Si,1 =10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun ) *3.16e-5 *n_H,1.

Similarly, for Star_2:

n_Si,2 = (n_Mg,2 / (10^0.3 * (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun) )).

But n_Mg,2 =1e-5 *n_H,2.

So,

n_Si,2 = (1e-5 *n_H,2) / (10^0.3 * (1e-5 / (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun )) )

Wait,

= (1e-5 *n_H,2) * (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) / (10^0.3 *1e-5 )

The 1e-5 cancels.

= (n_H,2 *n_Si_sun ) / (10^0.3 *n_H_sun )

So,

n_Si,2 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) *n_H,2 /10^0.3.

Now, the ratio n_Si,1/n_Si,2 is:

[10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun ) *3.16e-5 *n_H,1 ] / [ (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) *n_H,2 / 10^0.3 ]

Hmm, this seems complicated, but let's substitute n_Si_sun /n_H_sun as (n_Si/n_H)_sun.

Wait, but I don't know that value. Alternatively, perhaps I can relate n_Si_sun and n_Fe_sun.

In the Sun, n_Fe/n_H =3.16e-5.

But n_Si_sun is (n_Si/n_H)_sun *n_H_sun = x *n_H_sun, where x is (n_Si/n_H)_sun.

Wait, so n_Si_sun =x *n_H_sun.

n_Fe_sun =3.16e-5 *n_H_sun.

So,

n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun = (x *n_H_sun ) / (3.16e-5 *n_H_sun ) = x /3.16e-5.

So,

n_Si,1 =10^0.3 * (x /3.16e-5 ) *3.16e-5 *n_H,1.

The 3.16e-5 terms cancel.

n_Si,1 =10^0.3 *x *n_H,1.

Similarly, n_Si,2 = (x *n_H_sun )/(10^0.3 *n_H_sun ) *n_H,2 =x *n_H,2 /10^0.3.

So,

n_Si,1 =10^0.3 x n_H,1,

n_Si,2 =x n_H,2 /10^0.3.

So, the ratio:

n_Si,1 /n_Si,2 = (10^0.3 x n_H,1 ) / (x n_H,2 /10^0.3 ) )

The x cancels.

= (10^0.3 *10^0.3 ) * (n_H,1 /n_H,2 )

= 10^0.6 * (n_H,1 /n_H,2 )

Hmm, but I don't know the ratio of n_H,1 to n_H,2.

Wait, unless I can find n_H,1 and n_H,2 in terms of the stars' abundances.

Wait, but the problem doesn't give me any other data that relates the H content of the stars. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the ratio of n_H,1 and n_H,2 can be found from the fact that [Fe/H]_1 is 0 and [Mg/H]_2 is 0.

Wait, for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1=0 → (n_Fe,1/n_H,1 ) = (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun )=3.16e-5.

But I don't know if Star_2 has [Fe/H]=0. The problem only states [Mg/H]_2=0.

So,

Star_2: (n_Mg,2 /n_H,2 )= (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun )=1e-5.

But for Star_2, I don't know (n_Fe,2/n_H,2 ), so I can't directly relate n_H,2 to anything else.

Hmm. This seems like a dead end. Maybe I need to make an assumption that the H content is the same in both stars, but that's probably not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of H doesn't affect the final answer, which is the ratio of Si in the two stars. But I'm not seeing it.

Wait, let me think about the problem again. The question is about the ratio of Si atoms in the two stars, so maybe it's a ratio of their [Si/H] values.

Wait, [Si/H]_1 = log( (n_Si,1 /n_H,1 ) / (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) )

Similarly, [Si/H]_2 = log( (n_Si,2 /n_H,2 ) / (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) )

So,

[Si/H]_1 = log( (n_Si,1 /n_H,1 ) ) - log( n_Si_sun /n_H_sun )

But perhaps without knowing the Sun's [Si/H], I can't proceed.

Wait, but maybe I can find [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2 in terms of the given data.

Wait, for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 and [Fe/H]_1=0.

[Fe/H]_1=0 → [Fe/H]_1 = log( (n_Fe,1/n_H,1 ) / (n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun )) =0 → (n_Fe,1/n_H,1 )= (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun )=3.16e-5.

[Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → [Si/Fe]_1 = log( (n_Si,1/n_Fe,1 ) / (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun )) )=0.3.

So,

n_Si,1/n_Fe,1 =10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun )

But n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun is (n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun ) = (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun.

But [Si/Fe]_sun is 0 → (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun =1.

So,

n_Si,1/n_Fe,1 =10^0.3 =2.

Thus, n_Si,1=2 * n_Fe,1.

But n_Fe,1 =3.16e-5 *n_H,1.

So, n_Si,1 =2 *3.16e-5 *n_H,1=6.32e-5 *n_H,1.

So, [Si/H]_1 = log( (6.32e-5 *n_H,1 ) /n_H,1 ) = log(6.32e-5 )= log(6.32) + log(1e-5 )= ~0.8 + (-5) = -4.2.

Wait, that's [Si/H]_1 = -4.2.

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → (n_Mg,2/n_Si,2 ) =10^0.3 * (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun )=2 * (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun ).

[Si/H]_2 = log( (n_Si,2 /n_H,2 ) / (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun ) )

But I need to find [Si/H]_2.

Wait, let's find n_Si,2 in terms of n_H,2.

n_Mg,2 =1e-5 *n_H,2.

From [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → n_Mg,2 =10^0.3 * (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun ) *n_Si,2.

So,

1e-5 *n_H,2 = 2 * (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun ) *n_Si,2.

But (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun ) = (n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun )/(n_Si_sun/n_H_sun ) )= (1e-5 )/(n_Si_sun/n_H_sun ).

Hmm, but I don't know n_Si_sun/n_H_sun, which is [Si/H]_sun. Let me call that Y.

So,

n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun = (1e-5 ) / Y.

So,

1e-5 *n_H,2 = 2 * (1e-5/Y) *n_Si,2.

Cancel 1e-5:

n_H,2 = 2 * (1/Y) *n_Si,2 → n_Si,2 = (Y/2) *n_H,2.

So,

n_Si,2 = (Y/2) *n_H,2.

Thus, [Si/H]_2 = log( (n_Si,2 /n_H,2 ) ) - log(Y) = log(Y/2) - log(Y) = log(1/2 )= -0.3.

Wait, that's interesting. So [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

Wait, but wait: [Si/H]_2 is log( (n_Si,2/n_H,2 )/(n_Si_sun/n_H_sun )) ) = log( (Y/2) / Y ) )= log(1/2 )= -0.3.

Yes, that makes sense. So [Si/H]_2 =-0.3.

Wait, but I'm not sure if I did that correctly. Let me recalculate.

n_Si,2 = (Y/2) n_H,2.

So,

n_Si,2 /n_H,2 = Y/2.

The Sun's [Si/H] is log(Y) = [Si/H]_sun = 0 → Y=10^0=1.

Wait, no! Because [X/H]_sun is zero for all elements, so Y =n_Si_sun /n_H_sun =10^0=1.

Ah, that's a key point. So, Y=1.

So,

n_Si,2 = (1/2 ) *n_H,2.

Thus, [Si/H]_2 = log( (n_Si,2 /n_H,2 ) / (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun )) ) = log( (0.5 *n_H,2 /n_H,2 ) / 1 )= log(0.5 )= -0.3.

Yes, that's correct.

Similarly, for Star_1, [Si/H]_1 = log( (6.32e-5 *n_H,1 )/n_H,1 ) = log(6.32e-5 )= log(6.32) + log(1e-5 )= approx 0.8 + (-5 )= -4.2.

So, [Si/H]_1 =-4.2.

But wait, the problem is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the two stars. So, the question is what is (n_Si,1 /n_Si,2 )?

But I can express each [Si/H] in terms of their respective stars' H abundance.

n_Si,1 =10^([Si/H]_1 + log(n_Si_sun/n_H_sun )) *n_H,1.

But since [Si/H]_sun is 0, n_Si_sun/n_H_sun =1 → [Si/H] is log(n_Si/n_H).

Wait, no, [Si/H] = log10( (n_Si/n_H)_{star} / (n_Si/n_H)_{sun} )= log10( (n_Si/n_H)_{star} ) - log10( (n_Si/n_H)_{sun} )

Since (n_Si/n_H)_{sun}=1, [Si/H] = log10(n_Si/n_H)_{star}.

So, for Star_1:

[Si/H]_1 = log10(n_Si,1 /n_H,1 ) = -4.2 → n_Si,1/n_H,1 =10^-4.2 ≈6.3e-5.

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Si/H]_2 = log10(n_Si,2/n_H,2 )= -0.3 →n_Si,2/n_H,2 =10^-0.3 ≈0.5.

So, the ratio (n_Si,1/n_Si,2 ) is (n_Si,1/n_H,1 ) * (n_H,2/n_Si,2 )= (6.3e-5) * (n_H,2/(0.5 *n_H,2 )) )= (6.3e-5) * (1/0.5 )= 6.3e-5 *2=1.26e-4.

Wait, that can't be right. Because that would imply that Star_1 has less silicon than Star_2, but the given [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3, which suggests more Si relative to Fe. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, no, wait. Let's clarify.

The ratio is (n_Si,1 /n_Si,2 ) = (n_Si,1/n_H,1 ) * (n_H,2/n_Si,2 ).

But,

n_Si,1/n_H,1 =10^([Si/H]_1 ) =10^(-4.2 )=6.3e-5.

n_Si,2/n_H,2 =10^(-0.3 )=0.5.

So,

n_Si,1/n_Si,2 = (6.3e-5 /0.5 ) * (n_H,2 /n_H,1 )

Wait, but I don't know the ratio of n_H,2 to n_H,1.

Hmm. This is the crux of the problem. Without knowing how the hydrogen abundance changes between the stars, I can't directly find the ratio of silicon atoms.

Wait, but perhaps I can relate n_H,1 and n_H,2 using their iron abundances.

Wait, Star_1 has [Fe/H]=0, so (n_Fe,1 /n_H,1 )= (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun )=3.16e-5.

Star_2's [Fe/H] is not given, so I can't say anything about (n_Fe,2 /n_H,2 ). Hmm.

But perhaps I can find the ratio n_H,1 /n_H,2 using the fact that the stars have different masses, but I'm not sure how that relates to their photospheric composition.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the overall H content is the same in both stars, but I don't think that's a valid assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved without considering the H ratio, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: perhaps the ratio of silicon atoms is (n_Si,1 /n_Si,2 ) = (6.3e-5 ) / (0.5 )= 1.26e-4 → 0.000126, which isn't one of the options. So I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the ratio of [Si/H]_1 to [Si/H]_2.

Wait, [Si/H]_1 =-4.2, [Si/H]_2 =-0.3.

The ratio would be 10^(-4.2 ) /10^(-0.3 )=10^(-3.9 )≈1.26e-4, which is the same as before.

But that's a very small ratio, and the options don't include anything that small. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the ratio as [n_Si,1 /n_Si,2 ] = (n_Si,1 /n_H,1 ) * (n_H,2 /n_Si,2 )).

But without knowing the ratio of n_H,1 to n_H,2, I can't compute this.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the hydrogen abundance is the same in both stars, which would make the ratio (n_Si,1/n_Si,2 ) = (6.3e-5 ) / 0.5 = 1.26e-4, but that's not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is (n_Si,1 /n_Si,2 ) = (6.3e-5 ) / (0.5 )=1.26e-4 → 0.000126.

But none of the options match that. So I must have made a wrong assumption somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this using only the given [X/Y] values without considering the absolute abundances.

Another approach: let's express the silicon abundance in each star as a fraction of hydrogen.

For Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(n_Si/n_Fe)_1 =0.3 → n_Si,1 =n_Fe,1 *10^0.3.

[Fe/H]_1=0 →n_Fe,1 = (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun ) *n_H,1.

n_Fe_sun =3.16e-5 *n_H_sun.

So,

n_Si,1 =3.16e-5 *n_H,1 *10^0.3.

Similarly,

n_Si,1 =3.16e-5 *2 *n_H,1 ≈6.32e-5 *n_H,1.

For Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → log(n_Mg/n_Si)_2 =0.3 →n_Mg,2 =n_Si,2 *10^0.3.

[Mg/H]_2=0 →n_Mg,2 = (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun ) *n_H,2 =1e-5 *n_H,2.

So,

1e-5 *n_H,2 =n_Si,2 *10^0.3 →n_Si,2 = (1e-5 *n_H,2 )/10^0.3 =1e-5 *n_H,2 /2 ≈5e-6 *n_H,2.

Now, to find the ratio of n_Si,1 to n_Si,2:

n_Si,1 /n_Si,2 = (6.32e-5 *n_H,1 ) / (5e-6 *n_H,2 ) )= (6.32e-5 /5e-6 ) * (n_H,1/n_H,2 )

= (12.64 ) * (n_H,1/n_H,2 )

But without knowing the ratio of n_H,1 to n_H,2, I can't proceed.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the hydrogen abundance is the same in both stars. If that's the case, then n_H,1 =n_H,2 → ratio=12.64.

Looking at the options, option B is ~12.6, which matches this.

But why would the hydrogen be the same in both stars? They have different masses, so their overall hydrogen content would vary. However, perhaps in the photosphere, the H abundance is normalized in a way that makes this assumption valid.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects this approach, so the answer is approximately 12.6, option B.


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the provided data to compute the silicon-to-hydrogen ratio ([Si/H]) for each star. The ratio of silicon atoms in the two stars is then derived from these values.

   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex → \( \frac{n_{\text{Fe},1}}{n_{\text{H},1}} = \frac{n_{\text{Fe,sun}}}{n_{\text{H,sun}}} = 3.16 \times 10^{-5} \)

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex → \( \log_{10} \left( \frac{n_{\text{Mg},2}}{n_{\text{Si},2}} \right) = 0.3 \)
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex → \( \frac{n_{\text{Mg},2}}{n_{\text{H},2}} = \frac{n_{\text{Mg,sun}}}{n_{\text{H,sun}}} = 1 \times 10^{-5} \)

### **Analysis**
#### **Star_1**:
1. From [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3:
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{Si},1}}{n_{\text{Fe},1}} = 10^{0.3} \approx 2
   \]
2. From [Fe/H]_1 = 0:
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{Fe},1}}{n_{\text{H},1}} = 3.16 \times 10^{-5}
   \]
   Substituting \( n_{\text{Fe},1} = 3.16 \times 10^{-5} \cdot n_{\text{H},1} \) into the previous equation:
   \[
   n_{\text{Si},1} = 2 \cdot n_{\text{Fe},1} = 2 \cdot (3.16 \times 10^{-5} \cdot n_{\text{H},1}) = 6.32 \times 10^{-5} \cdot n_{\text{H},1}
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{Si},1}}{n_{\text{H},1}} = 6.32 \times 10^{-5}
   \]

#### **Star_2**:
1. From [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3:
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{Mg},2}}{n_{\text{Si},2}} = 10^{0.3} \approx 2
   \]
2. From [Mg/H]_2 = 0:
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{Mg},2}}{n_{\text{H},2}} = 1 \times 10^{-5}
   \]
   Substituting \( n_{\text{Mg},2} = 1 \times 10^{-5} \cdot n_{\text{H},2} \) into the previous equation:
   \[
   1 \times 10^{-5} \cdot n_{\text{H},2} = 2 \cdot n_{\text{Si},2}
   \]
   Solving for \( n_{\text{Si},2} \):
   \[
   n_{\text{Si},2} = \frac{1 \times 10^{-5} \cdot n_{\text{H},2}}{2} = 5 \times 10^{-6} \cdot n_{\text{H},2}
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{Si},2}}{n_{\text{H},2}} = 5 \times 10^{-6}
   \]

#### **Ratio of Silicon Atoms**:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the two stars is:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si},1}}{n_{\text{Si},2}} = \frac{\frac{n_{\text{Si},1}}{n_{\text{H},1}}}{\frac{n_{\text{Si},2}}{n_{\text{H},2}}} = \frac{6.32 \times 10^{-5}}{5 \times 10^{-6}} = 12.64
\]

---

### **Conclusion**
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **12.6**.
