Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these buffer solutions and phosphate equilibria. But let's try to work through it step by step.

The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in a solution. The solution has 200 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. They've added 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molar masses are given as 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the other salt. The temperatures at 25°C, which is room temperature, so I think activity coefficients are probably considered 1, but maybe that's a detail I don't need to worry about right now.

Hmm, I remember that phosphate exists in different forms depending on the pH. The species are H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. The problem gives the three dissociation constants: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. Oh wait, so that means each step deprotonates the phosphate.

The solution has both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Wait, what are these salts? Let me think. KH2PO4 is potassium dihydrogen phosphate, which I believe dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate (with some water of crystallization), which dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. So in solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. 

Wait, when these two are mixed, they form a buffer solution. Because H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-, or accept to become H3PO4. So the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, right? Because the pH is in between the second and third dissociation constants? Or wait, no. H3PO4 has three protons, so each dissociation step is a different pH range. The first dissociation is H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1 =7.5e-3), second is H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2=6.2e-8), and third is HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3=1.8e-12). 

So, if the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, it's a buffer system using the second dissociation. So the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation would apply here, using Ka2. Because the relevant equilibrium is H2PO4^- ↔ HPO4^2- + H+.

Wait, but the question asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think is PO4^3-. Oh wait, no, orthophosphate is H3PO4, but sometimes people refer to PO4^3- as orthophosphate. Maybe I should double-check. Oh, right, orthophosphate is PO4^3-, but in solution, it's mostly as HPO4^2- or H2PO4^- depending on pH. So in this buffer, the PO4^3- concentration would be minimal because it's the third dissociation, which is way less likely (since Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is very small). So PO4^3- would be negligible compared to HPO4^2-.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which, I'm a bit confused about. Let me think. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in solution, it's more likely to be in the deprotonated forms. Alternatively, maybe the term here refers to the PO4^3- ion. Well, regardless, perhaps the solution is to find the concentration of PO4^3-.

But wait, if the solution is mostly H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which are in a buffer, then perhaps the PO4^3- concentration is tiny. But let's proceed.

So, first, I need to calculate the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution.

The solution is made by dissolving 1.00 g of each salt in 200 cm³ (0.2 L) of solution.

So, moles of KH2PO4: mass (g) / molar mass. So 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol. Let me compute that. 1 / 136.09 is approximately 0.00733 mol. So about 0.00733 moles of H2PO4^- in solution.

Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 1 / 177.99 ≈ 0.00561 mol. So that's about 0.00561 moles of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but wait, Na2HPO4·2H2O: when it dissociates, does it give HPO4^2- or something else? Yes, because the formula is Na2HPO4·2H2O. So when it dissolves, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So, the total volume is 0.2 L. So the concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.00733 mol / 0.2 L = 0.03665 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.00561 mol / 0.2 L = 0.02805 M.

So, now, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the buffer. The pH can be found using pKa2 = log ( [HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4^-] )

Wait, the Henderson equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid])

In this case, the acid is H2PO4^- (since it can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-), so the base is HPO4^2-.

So, pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) ≈ let's calculate that.

Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so log(6.2) is about 0.7924, so log(6.2e-8) is 0.7924 -8 = -7.2076. So pKa2 is 7.2076.

So, pH = 7.2076 + log( (0.02805) / (0.03665) )

Compute the ratio: 0.02805 / 0.03665 ≈ 0.766. Log(0.766) is approximately log(7.66e-1) = log(7.66) + (-1). Log(7.66) is about 0.885, so 0.885 -1 = -0.115.

So pH ≈ 7.2076 -0.115 = 7.0926.

Hmm, but wait, I'm not sure. Because the Henderson equation is for when the solution is a buffer between two species. So the pH here is around 7.09.

Now, the problem is to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think refers to PO4^3-.

So, to find [PO4^3-], maybe I need to consider the third dissociation step, which is HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+.

The Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is much smaller than Ka1 and Ka2. So the concentration of PO4^3- will be very low.

But wait, from the solution, we have HPO4^2- from the Na2HPO4. So perhaps the PO4^3- comes from the HPO4^2- dissociating further.

So, the relevant equilibrium is:

HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+

The expression for Ka3 is [PO4^3-][H+]/[HPO4^2-] = 1.8e-12.

We can rearrange this to find [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

But wait, the [H+] can be found from the pH which we calculated earlier as approximately 7.09. So [H+] = 10^-pH ≈ 10^-7.09 ≈ 7.94e-8 M.

So, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12) * (0.02805) / (7.94e-8).

Let me compute that step by step.

First, multiply 1.8e-12 by 0.02805: 1.8e-12 * 0.02805 ≈ 5.049e-14.

Then, divide by 7.94e-8: 5.049e-14 /7.94e-8 ≈ 6.356e-7.

Wait, but wait a second. That would be [PO4^3-] ≈ 6.36e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close. But wait, perhaps I should be more precise in the calculations.

Wait, let's re-calculate the [H+] more accurately.

pH was found to be approximately 7.0926, so [H+] = 10^(-7.0926).

Let me compute 10^-7.0926. 10^-7 is 1e-7, 10^-0.0926 is about 0.875 (since 10^-0.1 ≈ 0.794, but 0.0926 is a bit less, maybe around 0.875).

So [H+] is approximately 8.75e-8 M.

Wait, let me compute 10^(-7.0926) exactly.

7.0926 = 7 + 0.0926.

10^0.0926: using logarithms. Because 10^0.0926 = e^(0.0926 * ln10) ≈ e^(0.0926 * 2.302585) ≈ e^(0.2130) ≈ 1.237.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, 10^x is the same as e^(x ln10), so for x=0.0926: 0.0926 * 2.302585 ≈ 0.2130. e^0.2130 is about 1.237. But wait, 10^0.09 is around 1.228 (since 10^0.07918 is 1.2, 0.09 is a bit higher). Hmm, but perhaps a calculator would give a more precise value, but for the purposes here, maybe I can proceed.

Wait, another approach: 10^0.0926.

We know that 10^0.1 ≈ 1.2589, and 0.0926 is 7.26% less than 0.1, so let me approximate 10^0.0926 ≈ 1.2589 * (0.9276) ≈ around 1.170.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use a calculator approach. Alternatively, perhaps another approach is better.

Wait, perhaps it's more accurate to compute pH more precisely.

Wait, the Henderson equation calculation: pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

pKa2 is 7.2076.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.00561 mol / 0.2 L = 0.02805 M.

[H2PO4^-] = 0.00733 mol / 0.2 L = 0.03665 M.

Ratio = 0.02805 / 0.03665 ≈ 0.766.

Log(0.766) is approximately −0.115, as I thought earlier.

So pH is 7.2076 − 0.115 = 7.0926.

So [H+] = 10^(-7.0926) ≈ 8.75e-8 M.

Wait, because 10^(-7.0926) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.0926) = 1e-7 * (approx 0.875) )= 8.75e-8.

So, [H+] = 8.75e-8.

Now, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+ ].

Ka3=1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] is 0.02805 M.

So, numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02805 = (1.8 * 0.02805) * 1e-12.

1.8 * 0.02805 ≈ 0.05049.

So numerator is 0.05049e-12, which is 5.049e-14.

Denominator: 8.75e-8.

So [PO4^3-] = 5.049e-14 / 8.75e-8.

Let me compute that. 5.049 /8.75 ≈ 0.5773. Then, exponents: 1e-14 /1e-8 = 1e-6.

So 0.5773e-6 → 5.773e-7 M.

Wait, but wait, that's approximately 5.77e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option B is 5.48e-7, and option D is 3.97e-7. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, maybe I should be more precise with the [HPO4^2-] and [H2PO4^-] concentrations.

Wait, let me calculate the exact moles.

Molar mass of KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol.

Moles of KH2PO4 = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007334 mol.

Molar mass of Na2HPO4·2H2O is 177.99 g/mol.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005613 mol.

So [H2PO4^-] = 0.007334 / 0.2 = 0.03667 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005613 / 0.2 = 0.028065 M.

So the ratio is 0.028065 / 0.03667 ≈ 0.766.

Log(0.766) is exactly: log(7.66 × 10^-1) = log(7.66) + log(10^-1) = 0.885 -1 = -0.115.

So pH is 7.2076 - 0.115 = 7.0926.

Which gives [H+] = 10^-7.0926 ≈ 8.75e-8 M.

Now, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / (8.75e-8).

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028065 = 5.0517e-14.

Denominator: 8.75e-8.

So 5.0517e-14 /8.75e-8 = (5.0517 /8.75) * 1e-6.

5.0517 ÷ 8.75 ≈ 0.5775.

So 0.5775e-6 → 5.775e-7 M.

Hmm, that's about 5.78e-7 M.

Looking at the options: option B is 5.48e-7, which is close but not exactly matching. Option A is 6.24e-7, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the pH.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value of the ratio 0.028065 / 0.03667.

Wait, 0.028065 ÷ 0.03667.

Let me compute that more accurately.

0.028065 / 0.03667 = ?

Let me compute 28065 / 36670.

Well, 36670 × 0.766 = 28065.62. So 0.766 is exact. So the ratio is exactly 0.766.

So log(0.766) is about −0.115, as before.

Wait, perhaps the issue is with the [H+] calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 10^(-7.0926) more accurately.

Let me compute 7.0926 as pH.

We can use more precise calculation for [H+].

pH = 7.0926 → [H+] = 10^(-7.0926) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.0926).

Compute 10^(-0.0926):

Let me take natural logs.

ln(10^(-0.0926)) = -0.0926 * ln(10) ≈ -0.0926 * 2.302585 ≈ -0.2130.

So e^(-0.2130) ≈ 0.808.

Because e^-0.2 is approximately 0.8187, and e^-0.213 is a bit lower, say about 0.808.

So 10^(-0.0926) ≈ 0.808.

Thus, [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.808 = 8.08e-8 M.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 8.75e-8. So perhaps my earlier approximation was off.

So using [H+] = 8.08e-8 M.

Now, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / 8.08e-8.

So, numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028065 = 5.0517e-14.

Denominator: 8.08e-8.

So 5.0517e-14 / 8.08e-8 = (5.0517 / 8.08 ) * 1e-6.

5.0517 ÷ 8.08 ≈ 0.625 (since 8.08 × 0.625 = 5.05).

So, 0.625e-6 → 6.25e-7 M.

Hmm, so that brings us back to around 6.25e-7 M, which is option A (6.24e-7). But wait, earlier I calculated 5.77e-7 using a higher [H+]. So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the exact value of [H+] is needed. Alternatively, perhaps I should solve the buffer equation more precisely.

Wait, let's use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation more accurately.

pKa2 is 7.2076.

The ratio of [base]/[acid] is 0.766.

So, pH = 7.2076 + log(0.766).

Log(0.766) is more precisely calculated.

Let me compute log(0.766).

Using log(7.66) = log(7) + log(1.094) ≈ 0.8451 + 0.0398 = approximately 0.8849. So log(7.66 × 10^-1) = 0.8849 -1 = -0.1151.

So pH = 7.2076 - 0.1151 = 7.0925.

So, [H+] = 10^−7.0925 = 10^−7 × 10^−0.0925.

What's 10^-0.0925?

Let me compute 10^-0.0925.

We can use the Taylor expansion or a calculator-like approach.

Alternatively, perhaps using precise calculation:

ln(10^−0.0925) = −0.0925 × ln(10) ≈ −0.0925 × 2.302585 ≈ −0.2130.

So e^−0.2130 ≈ ?

We know that e^-0.2 ≈ 0.8187, e^-0.2130 is a bit less.

Let me compute it more accurately.

The Taylor series for e^x is 1 + x + x²/2 + x^3/6 + x^4/24 + ...

For x = -0.213.

e^(-0.213) ≈ 1 - 0.213 + (0.213)^2 / 2 - (0.213)^3 /6 + (0.213)^4 /24.

Let me compute each term.

1 = 1.

-0.213 = -0.213.

(0.213)^2 = 0.045369 → divided by 2 → 0.022685.

(0.213)^3 = 0.045369 *0.213 ≈ 0.009653 → divided by 6 → ~0.001609.

(0.213)^4 ≈ 0.009653 * 0.213 ≈ 0.002053 → divided by 24 → ~0.0000855.

Adding up:

1 -0.213 = 0.787.

+0.022685 → 0.809685.

-0.001609 → 0.808076.

+0.0000855 → 0.8081615.

So approx 0.8082.

So 10^-0.0925 ≈ 0.8082.

So [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.8082 = 8.082e-8 M.

Now, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / 8.082e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028065 = 5.0517e-14.

Denominator: 8.082e-8.

So, 5.0517e-14 /8.082e-8 = (5.0517/8.082) * 1e-6.

5.0517 ÷8.082 = approximately 0.625 (since 8.082 *0.625 =5.05125). So 0.625 *1e-6=6.25e-7 M.

So the concentration of PO4^3- is approximately 6.25e-7 M, which matches option A (6.24e-7).

Wait, but earlier when I used [H+] =8.75e-8, I got 5.77e-7, but with the more accurate [H+] of 8.08e-8, I get 6.25e-7.

So option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close.

But why is option B 5.48e-7? Perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step.

Wait, perhaps the calculation involves considering the concentrations from both salts and any possible precipitation, but I don't think that applies here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, but the PO4^3- comes from the third dissociation.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the total solution for PO4 species.

But wait, another approach: perhaps the solution isn't just the buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-; perhaps I should consider that the solution is a buffer and also account for all the phosphate species.

Wait, another angle: the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- as the main species, but to find PO4^3-, I need to see how much HPO4^2- dissociates into PO4^3-.

But the concentration of PO4^3- would be determined by the third dissociation, as we did earlier.

Wait, but perhaps the initial step is correct, and the answer is approximately 6.25e-7 M, which would be option A.

But another possibility is that I have the ratio backwards in the Henderson equation.

Wait, Henderson equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]).

In the buffer system between H2PO4^- (acid) and HPO4^2- (base), so the base is HPO4^2-, and the acid is H2PO4^-.

So, [base] is HPO4^2- (0.028065 M), [acid] is H2PO4^- (0.03667 M).

So the ratio is [base]/[acid] = 0.028065 /0.03667 ≈0.766.

So the calculation is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution is a buffer between HPO4^2- and PO4^3-, but that's not the case because the pH is around 7.09, which is higher than pKa3 (which is 12), but wait, no, pKa3 is about 11.7 (since Ka3 is 1.8e-12, so pKa3 ≈ 11.74).

Wait, pH is 7.09, which is below pKa3. So the third dissociation would be minimal, which is why [PO4^3-] is so low.

Wait, perhaps I should write all the equilibria.

H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1=7.5e-3)

H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2=6.2e-8)

HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3=1.8e-12)

So, the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. The PO4^3- comes from the third step.

So, the correct approach is to calculate [PO4^3-] based on the [HPO4^2-] and [H+], which we've done.

So with [H+] =8.08e-8 M, [HPO4^2-] =0.028065 M.

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+ ] = (1.8e-12 *0.028065) / 8.08e-8.

Which is (5.0517e-14)/8.08e-8 ≈6.25e-7 M.

So option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close.

But wait, let me recheck the options.

Options:

A) 6.24x10^-7 M

B)5.48x10^-7 M

C)2.81x10^-7 M

D)3.97x10^-7 M

So I get approximately 6.25e-7, which is option A.

But wait, in my earlier calculation, I considered the [H+] as 8.08e-8, but perhaps I should be more precise.

Wait, perhaps a more precise calculation of 10^-0.0925.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the exact [H+] using the precise pH.

Let me compute 10^(-7.0925).

Using a calculator approach, 7.0925 is pH → [H+] = 8.08e-8 M.

But perhaps a more precise value would be better.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact ratio of [HPO4^2-] and [H2PO4^-].

Wait, another thought: perhaps the solution isn't just the buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, but also considers that some PO4^3- could form from HPO4^2-, but given that the pH is around 7.09, which is much lower than pKa3 (11.74), the [PO4^3-] would be much lower than [HPO4^2-].

So, perhaps the initial approach is correct.

Wait, but why is option B 5.48e-7? Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute [PO4^3-] using the exact value of [H+], which I can compute more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the exact expression for the third dissociation.

Wait, perhaps I should set up the equilibrium expression for HPO4^2- and PO4^3-.

The equilibrium is HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-].

We can solve for [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

We have Ka3 =1.8e-12, [HPO4^2-] =0.028065 M, [H+] =8.08e-8 M.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 *0.028065)/(8.08e-8) = (5.0517e-14)/(8.08e-8) = 6.255e-7 M.

So approximately 6.255e-7, which is about 6.26e-7 M.

Comparing to the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M, which is very close.

So the correct answer should be option A.

But wait, looking back, the options don't have 6.25e-7. Option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close.

So the correct answer is A.

To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the buffer system formed by KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The solution contains 1.00 g of each salt in 200.00 cm³ (0.2 L). The molar masses are 136.09 g/mol for KH₂PO₄ and 177.99 g/mol for Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O.

### Step 1: Calculate moles of each salt
- Moles of KH₂PO₄:  
  \[
  \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}} = \frac{1.00}{136.09} \approx 0.007334 \, \text{mol}
  \]
  This contributes 0.007334 mol of H₂PO₄⁻.

- Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O:  
  \[
  \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}} = \frac{1.00}{177.99} \approx 0.005613 \, \text{mol}
  \]
  This contributes 0.005613 mol of HPO₄²⁻.

### Step 2: Calculate concentrations in solution
The total volume of the solution is 0.2 L.  
- \([H₂PO₄⁻]\):  
  \[
  [H₂PO₄⁻] = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Volume}} = \frac{0.007334}{0.2} \approx 0.03667 \, \text{M}
  \]

- \([HPO₄²⁻]\):  
  \[
  [HPO₄²⁻] = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Volume}} = \frac{0.005613}{0.2} \approx 0.028065 \, \text{M}
  \]

### Step 3: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find pH
The buffer system involves H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, with \( \text{Ka}_2 = 6.2 \times 10^{-8} \).  
The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{Base}]}{[\text{Acid}]} \right)
\]
Here, \(\text{p}K_a = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.2076\), \([\text{Base}] = [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.028065 \, \text{M}\), and \([\text{Acid}] = [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.03667 \, \text{M}\).  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.2076 + \log \left( \frac{0.028065}{0.03667} \right)
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 7.2076 + \log(0.766) \approx 7.2076 - 0.115 = 7.0926
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \([H^+]\)
From the pH:  
\[
[H^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.0926} \approx 8.08 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 5: Use the third dissociation equilibrium to find \([PO₄³⁻]\)
The third dissociation of phosphate is:  
\[
\text{HPO₄²⁻} \leftrightarrow \text{H}^+ + \text{PO₄³⁻}, \quad \text{Ka}_3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12}
\]
The equilibrium expression is:  
\[
K_a = \frac{[H^+][PO₄³⁻]}{[HPO₄²⁻]}
\]
Rearranging for \([PO₄³⁻]\):  
\[
[PO₄³⁻] = \frac{K_a [HPO₄²⁻]}{[H^+]}
\]
Substitute the values:  
\[
[PO₄³⁻] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12})(0.028065)}{8.08 \times 10^{-8}}
\]
\[
[PO₄³⁻] = \frac{5.0517 \times 10^{-14}}{8.08 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

### Final Answer
The concentration of orthophosphate ions (\(PO₄³⁻\)) is approximately \(6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which corresponds to **Option A**.
