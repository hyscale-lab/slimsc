Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about space travel and time dilation. Let me break it down step by step.

The question is about an astronaut from an alien civilization traveling to Earth at a speed very close to the speed of light. The spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987 times the speed of light, which is super fast. The astronaut is 22 years old, and I need to find out how long the trip will take from their perspective. The options are various years and whether they die before reaching.

Wait, but I remember that when you travel at such high speeds, time dilation occurs. So, the astronaut's own experienced time (proper time) is different from the time measured by someone on Earth. Oh right, this is due to Einstein's theory of relativity, specifically the time dilation effect in special relativity.

So, the proper time (the time the astronaut experiences) is shorter than the time observed from Earth. The formula for time dilation is the Lorentz factor gamma, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, in this case, the astronaut's time is the proper time, so we need to calculate the Earth time and then find the proper time.

Wait, actually, the problem says the astronaut is 22 years old, and the question is about the time they experience. So, I think the approach is to calculate the time it takes to reach Earth from Earth's frame, and then apply time dilation to find the astronaut's experienced time.

Wait, but I might have to get the distance involved. Oh, wait, the distance from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure about the exact distance, but I think the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 to 200,000 light-years away. Let me check that. I remember that the Milky Way is about 100,000 light-years in diameter, and the LMC is a satellite galaxy, so maybe about 160,000 light-years? Let's go with approximately 163,000 light-years as the distance.

So, the spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987c. Let me calculate the time it takes from Earth's perspective. Time is distance divided by speed. So, t_earth = distance / speed.

Distance is 163,000 light-years. Speed is 0.99999987c, so the time is (163000 ly) / (0.99999987 c). Since one light-year is the distance light travels in a year, the time in years would be t_earth = 163000 / 0.99999987 ≈ roughly 163,000 * (1 / 0.99999987) ≈ approximately 163,000 * 1.00000013. So that's about 163,000 + (163000 * 0.00000013). Let me compute that: 163000 * 0.00000013 = 0.02119. So t_earth ≈ 163,000.02119 years. Approximately 163,000 years.

Wait, that's a really long time. But the astronaut's lifetime is only 150 solar years, but they are 22 now, so they have about 128 years left. Wait, but according to Earth time, it would take 163,000 years, but the astronaut's time is much shorter due to time dilation.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. So, the astronaut's experienced time is the Earth time multiplied by sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Because proper time is shorter. So, the time experienced, t_astro = t_earth * sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

Alternatively, using the Lorentz factor gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is 1/gamma. So, t_astro = t_earth / gamma.

But first, let me compute gamma. v is 0.99999987c. So v²/c² is (0.99999987)^2. Let's compute that. Let me compute (0.99999987)^2.

0.99999987 squared is approximately (1 - 0.00000013)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.00000013 + (0.00000013)^2 ≈ 0.99999974 (since 2e-7 is 0.0000002, but wait, more accurately, perhaps I should compute it as (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 ≈ 1 - 2.6e-7 + (1.69e-14) ≈ approximately 0.99999974. So, 1 - v²/c² ≈ 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026.

Wait no, wait: 1 - (v²/c²) = 1 - (0.99999987)^2.

Let me compute 0.99999987 * 0.99999987.

Calculating 0.99999987^2:

Let me think, (1 - x)^2 = 1 - 2x + x². Here, x is 0.00000013, because 1 - 0.99999987 = 0.00000013.

So, x=1.3e-7.

So, (1-x)^2 = 1 - 2x + x².

So, 2x is 2.6e-7, x squared is 1.69e-14, which is negligible.

So, 1 - 2x is approximately 1 - 2.6e-7 = 0.99999974.

So, 1 - v²/c² = 1 - (0.99999987)^2 = 1 - (1 - 2.6e-7) = 2.6e-7.

Wait, wait, no: wait, 1 - v²/c² is 1 - (0.99999987)^2 = 1 - (0.99999974) = 2.6e-7.

So, sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is sqrt(2.6e-7).

Wait, sqrt(2.6e-7) is approximately sqrt(2.6)*1e-3.5.

Wait, sqrt(2.6) is about 1.612, and 1e-3.5 is 1e-3 * 1e-0.5 = 1e-3 * (1/sqrt(10)) ≈ 3.16e-4.

So, 1.612 * 3.16e-4 ≈ 5.08e-4.

Wait, let me compute sqrt(2.6e-7) more accurately.

2.6e-7 = 2.6 x 10^-7.

The square root of 2.6 is approximately 1.612, and sqrt(1e-7) is 1e-3.5 = 3.162e-4.

So, 1.612 * 3.162e-4 ≈ 5.08e-4.

Alternatively, thinking in exponents: 2.6e-7 = 2.6 * 1e-7. The square root is sqrt(2.6) * 1e-3.5 = 1.612 * 3.162e-4 ≈ 5.08e-4.

So, sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ 5.08e-4.

So, gamma is 1/(5.08e-4) ≈ 1968. So, gamma is approximately 1968.

Wait, wait, wait, because 1e-3 is 0.001, and 5e-4 is 0.0005. So 1/0.0005 is 2000. So, since 5.08e-4 is a little more than 0.0005, the gamma would be a little less than 2000. Let's say about 1968.

But perhaps I should calculate it more accurately.

Wait, let me compute v = 0.99999987c.

So, v² = (0.99999987)^2 c².

So, 1 - v²/c² = 1 - (0.99999987)^2.

Let me compute that precisely.

Compute 0.99999987 * 0.99999987.

Compute 0.99999987^2:

Let me write it as (1 - 0.00000013)^2 = 1 - 2*0.00000013 + (0.00000013)^2.

Which is 1 - 0.00000026 + 1.69e-14.

So, 1 - 0.00000026 is 0.99999974.

So, 1 - v²/c² is 0.00000026.

Wait, 0.00000026 is 2.6e-7.

So, sqrt(2.6e-7) is sqrt(2.6)*1e-3.5.

As I calculated before, it's about 5.08e-4.

So, gamma is 1/(5.08e-4) ≈ 1968.5.

So, gamma ≈ 1968.5.

So, the proper time (time experienced by the astronaut) is t_astro = t_earth / gamma.

Wait, no. Wait, t_earth is the time measured in Earth's frame. The astronaut's proper time is t_astro = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = t_earth / gamma.

Because, t_astro = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = t_earth * (1/gamma).

Wait, no. Because gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is 1/gamma.

So, t_astro = t_earth * (1/gamma).

So, t_earth is the time measured on Earth, which is 163,000 years.

Wait, no, wait. Earlier, I thought the distance is 163,000 light-years. So, time from Earth's perspective is (163,000 light-years) / (0.99999987c) = 163000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163000 years.

Wait, that's a simplification. Wait, because light-year is distance, and speed is in terms of c, so the units work out. So, t_earth is 163000 / 0.99999987 ≈ about 163,000 years.

So, t_earth ≈ 163,000 years.

So, t_astro = (163,000 years) * (1/gamma) = 163,000 / 1968.5 ≈ let's compute that.

163,000 divided by 2000 is about 81.5. But since gamma is about 1968.5, which is a bit less than 2000, the division will be a bit higher.

Wait, 1968.5 is approximately 1968.5 = 2000 - 31.5.

So, 163000 / 1968.5 ≈ let's compute it.

163000 / 1968.5 ≈ let me approximate.

1968.5 times 80 is 1968.5 * 80 = 157,480.

Subtract that from 163,000: 163,000 - 157,480 = 5,520.

So, 1968.5 * x = 5,520.

x ≈ 5,520 / 1968.5 ≈ approximately 2.8.

So, total t_astro ≈ 80 + 2.8 ≈ 82.8 years.

Wait, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, 1968.5 * 82 = ?

Let me compute 1968.5 * 80 = 157,480.

1968.5 * 2 = 3,937.

So, 1968.5 * 82 = 157,480 + 3,937 = 161,417.

That's less than 163,000.

The difference is 163,000 - 161,417 = 1,583.

1,583 / 1968.5 ≈ approximately 0.803.

So, 82.803 years.

So, about 82.8 years.

Wait, but the astronaut is 22 years old. So, adding 82.8 years would make them 104.8 years old. But their average lifetime is 150 years. So, 104 is less than 150, so they would survive. Wait, but wait, the options don't have 82.8. The options are 72, 77, 81, etc.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the distance. Maybe the distance from the LMC to Earth is about 160,000 light-years. Let me double-check. Wait, I think the actual distance is approximately 163,000 light-years, but sometimes it's given as about 160,000 to 200,000. Let me check that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recompute using the exact gamma value.

Wait, maybe I should compute gamma more accurately.

Let me compute gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

v = 0.99999987c.

v² = (0.99999987)^2 c² = (approx) 0.9999997408 c².

So, 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9999997408 = 0.0000002592.

So, 2.592e-7.

So, sqrt(2.592e-7) = sqrt(2.592) * 1e-3.5.

sqrt(2.592) is about 1.610 (since 1.61^2 is 2.5921), yes. So, sqrt(2.592e-7) = 1.610 * 3.1623e-4.

Wait, 1e-3.5 is approximately 3.1623e-4. So, 1.610 * 3.1623e-4 ≈ 5.086e-4.

So, gamma ≈ 1 / 5.086e-4 ≈ 1966. So, gamma is approximately 1966.

So, t_astro = t_earth / gamma.

t_earth is 163000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 / (approx 1) ?

Wait, because 0.99999987 is very close to 1. So, 163000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163000 * (1 + 1.3e-7) ≈ 163000 + (163000 * 1.3e-7).

163000 * 1.3e-7 = 163000 * 1.3 * 1e-7 = (163000 * 1.3) * 1e-7.

163000 * 1.3 = 211,900.

So, 211900e-7 = 0.02119 years.

So, t_earth ≈ 163000.02119 years.

So, t_earth ≈ 163,000 years.

So, t_astro = 163,000 / 1966 ≈ let me compute that.

163,000 / 1966 ≈ let's see:

1966 * 80 = 157,280.

Subtract from 163,000: 163,000 - 157,280 = 5,720.

5,720 / 1966 ≈ 2.91 years.

So, total t_astro ≈ 80 + 2.91 = 82.91 years.

So, approximately 83 years.

But looking at the options, none of them are 83. The options are A, B, C, D: B is 72, C is 81, D is 77.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the distance. Maybe the distance is 160,000 light-years, not 163,000. Let me try that.

If the distance is 160,000 light-years, then t_earth = 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 * (1 + 1.3e-7) ≈ 160,000 + 0.0208 ≈ 160,000.0208 years.

Then, t_astro = 160,000 / 1966 ≈ let's compute:

1966 * 80 = 157,280.

Subtract from 160,000: 160,000 -157,280 = 2,720.

2,720 / 1966 ≈ 1.383.

So, t_astro ≈ 80 + 1.383 ≈ 81.383 years.

Which is approximately 81.4 years.

Looking at the options, option C is 81 years. So, that would be the answer.

But wait, the options are:

A) Astronaut dies before reaching.

B) 72

C) 81

D) 77

So, option C is 81 years.

Wait, but I thought the astronaut's lifetime is 150 years. They are 22, so 150 -22 = 128 years left.

If the trip takes 81 years, they would be 22 + 81 = 103, which is less than 150. So, they would survive.

But wait, the question is about whether the astronaut dies before reaching. Wait, in the options, option A says the astronaut will die before reaching Earth.

But according to our calculation, the experienced time is about 81 years, which is less than the astronaut's remaining lifetime of 128 years. So, they would live.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the distance. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem states that the aliens' average lifetime is roughly 150 solar years. So, our astronaut is 22 now, leaving about 128 years. But if the trip takes 81 years, they would arrive at 103 years old, which is within their lifespan. So, they would survive.

But looking at the options again, option A is "The astronaut will die before reaching Earth." So, that can't be correct unless the experienced time is longer than 128 years.

But according to the calculation, it's about 81 years, so option C would be correct. But wait, the options don't have 81 as a survival option. Or they do. Wait, the question is, how long will it take for the astronaut to reach Earth from their perspective.

In our calculation, it's about 81 years. So option C is the correct answer.

Wait, but I thought that when you're moving at a high speed, the distance is contracted. So, from the astronaut's perspective, the distance is shorter, so the time taken is less.

Wait, another approach: the distance from Earth is L = 163,000 light-years. From the astronaut's frame, the distance is L' = L * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = L * (1/gamma).

So, L' = 163,000 * (1/1966) ≈ 82.8 light-years.

So, the time experienced is L' / v = (82.8 ly) / (0.99999987c) ≈ 82.8 / 0.99999987 ≈ 82.8 years.

Which aligns with our previous calculation.

So, the astronaut's experienced time is about 82.8 years. So, the closest option is C) 81 years.

Wait, but why is the answer not 83, but 81? Maybe due to more precise distances or a more precise gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps the distance is around 170,000 light-years, but that would make the time longer.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recompute gamma more accurately.

Wait, v = 0.99999987c.

Let me compute v²/c² = (0.99999987)^2.

Compute 0.99999987 * 0.99999987.

Let me compute 0.99999987 as 1 - 1.3e-7.

So, (1 - a)^2 = 1 - 2a + a².

a = 1.3e-7.

So, (1 - a)^2 = 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2.

Which is 1 - 2.6e-7 + (1.69e-14).

So, approximately 0.99999974 (since 2.6e-7 is 0.00000026), so 1 - 0.00000026 = 0.99999974.

So, 1 - v²/c² = 0.00000026.

So, sqrt(0.00000026) = sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 5.099e-4.

So, gamma = 1 / 5.099e-4 ≈ 1961. So, more accurately, gamma is about 1961.

So, t_astro = 163,000 / 1961 ≈ let's compute that.

163,000 / 1961 ≈

Let me compute 1961 * 83 = ?

Well, 1960 * 83 = 162, 280? Wait, 1960 *80=156,800, 1960*3=5,880. So, 156,800+5,880=162,680. So, 1961 *83=162,680 +83=162,763.

Which is less than 163,000.

The difference is 163,000 -162,763 = 237.

237 / 1961 ≈ 0.1208.

So, t_astro ≈83.1208 years.

So, about 83 years.

Hmm, but the options don't have 83. So, perhaps I made an error in the distance.

Another approach: perhaps the time from Earth's perspective is (distance)/(v) = (163,000 ly) / (0.99999987c) ≈ 163000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 * (1 + 1.3e-7) ≈ 163,000 + 0.02119 ≈ 163,000.02119 years.

So, t_earth = 163,000.02 years.

t_astro = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 163,000.02 * (5.099e-4).

Compute 163000 * 5.099e-4.

163000 * 5.099e-4 = 163000 * 0.0005099.

Compute 163000 * 0.0005 = 81.5.

163000 * 0.0000099 = 1.6137.

So, 81.5 + 1.6137 ≈ 83.1137.

So, t_astro ≈83.11 years.

So, the astronaut would experience about 83 years.

But the options are 77, 72, 81, etc.

Hmm, perhaps my assumption about the distance is wrong. Maybe the LMC is 160,000 ly away.

If distance is 160,000 ly, t_earth = 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 * (1 + 1.3e-7) ≈160,000.0208 years.

t_astro = 160,000.0208 * 5.099e-4 ≈ 160000 * 0.0005099.

= 160000 * 0.0005 =80.

160000 * 0.0000099=1.584.

So, 80 +1.584=81.584 years.

Which is about 81.58 years.

Which rounds to 82, but the closest option is C)81.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact gamma is 1961, so 163000 /1961= approx 83, but perhaps the distance is 163,000 ly.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the actual distance to the LMC. From what I remember, the LMC is about 160,000 light-years away, but sometimes it's stated as approximately 170,000. Wait, perhaps the actual distance is 170,000 light-years.

If distance is 170,000 ly, t_earth=170000 /0.99999987≈170000 *1.00000013≈170,000.221 years.

t_astro=170000.221 *5.099e-4≈

170000 * 5.099e-4 = 170,000 *0.0005099 = 87.683.

So, t_astro ≈87.683 years.

Which is even longer than 83, but that's not among the options.

Wait, perhaps the distance is 140,000 ly. Then t_earth=140,000 /0.99999987 ≈140,000 *1.00000013≈140,000.196 years.

t_astro=140,000.196 *5.099e-4 ≈140,000 * 0.0005099 ≈71.386 years.

That's around 71 years, close to option B (72).

But I'm not sure about the exact distance. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects a different approach, ignoring the actual distance and using the time dilation formula in another way.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting us to use the formula for time experienced, which is t = t0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where t0 is the time measured from Earth.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for t_astro = (distance from LMC to Earth) * (sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) / v.

Which is the same as (distance) * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) / v.

Because, from Earth's frame, time is t0 = distance /v.

t_astro = t0 * sqrt(1 -v²/c²) = (distance /v ) * sqrt(...) = distance * sqrt(1 -v²/c²) / v.

Hmm, but that's the same as (distance / v) * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) ).

Wait, perhaps another approach: Calculate the time experienced by the astronaut using the proper time formula.

Proper time, tau, is given by tau = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So, with t_earth = distance /v.

So, tau = (distance /v) * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Which can be rewritten as distance * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) / v.

Which is the same as distance * (sqrt(1 -v^2/c^2)) / v.

So, perhaps compute that.

Again, let me plug in the numbers.

Assuming distance D=163,000 ly.

v=0.99999987c.

Compute sqrt(1 -v²/c²)=sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2)=sqrt(0.00000026)=5.099e-4.

So, tau = 163000 * 5.099e-4 / 0.99999987.

Wait, because v is 0.99999987c, so v=0.99999987 *c.

So, 1/v = 1/(0.99999987 *c) = (1/0.99999987) * (1/c).

So, tau = D * sqrt(1 -v²/c²) / (v) = D * sqrt(...) / (0.99999987 c).

But D is in light-years, and c is in ly/year. So, the units should work out.

Wait, perhaps more accurately:

D = 163,000 ly.

v = 0.99999987 c.

So, tau = D * sqrt(1 -v²/c²) / v.

Which is (163000 ly) * (5.099e-4) / (0.99999987 c).

But 1 ly per year is the speed of light, so c=1 ly/year.

So, tau = 163000 *5.099e-4 / 0.99999987.

Compute 163000 * 5.099e-4:

163000 * 0.0005099 = 83.0957.

Then divide by 0.99999987 (approx 1), so approximately 83.0957 years.

So, about 83 years.

But the options don't have 83, but option C is 81.

Hmm, perhaps I should use a more precise value for gamma.

Wait, let me compute gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 1961.

Wait, so tau = t_earth / gamma.

t_earth = D / v = (163000 ly) / (0.99999987c) ≈ 163000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163000.02 years.

tau = 163000.02 / 1961 ≈ 83.12 years.

Still around 83.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the intended approach is using only the time dilation factor, but perhaps the problem is designed with a different distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the actual distance is about 77 years multiplied by gamma.

Wait, because the options include 77, which is about 83 * (1966/2000). Hmm, maybe the problem uses a different approximation for gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects you to compute using the spaceship's speed as 0.99999987c, but to compute the time using the approximation that gamma is approximately 2e6 or some other figure, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me recompute gamma accurately.

v = 0.99999987c.

v² = (0.99999987)^2 c².

Compute this:

0.99999987 * 0.99999987.

Let me compute this precisely.

Let me write 0.99999987 = 1 - 0.00000013.

So, (1 - a)^2 = 1 - 2a + a², where a=0.00000013.

So, (0.99999987)^2 = 1 - 2*(0.00000013) + (0.00000013)^2 = 1 - 0.00000026 + 1.69e-14.

Which is approximately 0.99999974.

So, 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026.

So, sqrt(0.00000026) = sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 5.099e-4.

So, gamma = 1 / 5.099e-4 ≈ 1961.

So, gamma is correct.

So, the time experienced is about 83 years, but the options don't have that. So, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but since the options don't include 83, I must have made an error.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the distance is much shorter, or perhaps I should consider the spaceship's speed as 0.99999987c, and use the approximation that gamma is about 2000.

Using gamma = 2000:

t_astro = t_earth / 2000.

If t_earth is 163,000 years, then 163000 /2000 =81.5, which rounds to 82, but the closest option is C)81.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects a more approximate calculation, leading to 81 years.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about the distance. Let me think: the LMC is about 160,000 light-years away, but perhaps the problem states a different distance, such as 163,000, and the options are approximate.

So, the answer should be approximately 81 years, option C.

But wait, another approach: perhaps the time experienced is t_astro= t_earth * sqrt(1 -v²/c²).

So, t_earth= D/(v) = 163000/0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 years.

t_astro=163,000 * sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2) =163000 *5.099e-4 ≈83 years.

But again, none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the problem considers the distance as approximately 170,000 ly? If D=170,000 ly, t_earth=170,000/0.99999987≈170,000 years.

t_astro=170000 *5.099e-4≈86.7 years.

Still no option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the time experienced is approximately 83 years, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is A: the astronaut dies before reaching. But that contradicts because 83 <150-22=128.

So, perhaps the intended approach is different. Let me think.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the time from the astronaut's perspective without considering the actual distance, but rather using relative velocity and time dilation.

Wait, the problem says the spaceship is traveling at 0.99999987c. So, the time experienced by the astronaut is t_astro = t_earth * sqrt(1 -v^2/c^2).

But without the distance, how can we calculate t_earth?

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the distance is 1 light-year. But that can't be, because the LMC is much farther.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to be a trick question, because the spaceship's speed is so high that the time experienced is so small that the astronaut doesn't die.

Wait, but the options are about the time taken, not about whether they survive.

Wait, the question states: "how long will it take for their 22 years old astronaut (from the point of view of the astronaut) to reach the Earth using this incredibly fast spacecraft?"

So, the answer is the proper time experienced by the astronaut, which we calculated as about 83 years. But the options are 72, 77, 81, or die.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate the gamma calculation with more precise numbers.

Let me compute 0.99999987^2.

Using a calculator approach, but since I can't use a calculator, perhaps I can compute it more accurately.

Compute (0.99999987)^2.

We have:

(1 - x)^2 = 1 - 2x + x², where x=0.00000013 (since 1 -0.99999987=0.00000013).

So,

(1 - x)^2 = 1 - 2x + x².

x=1.3e-7.

So,

2x = 2.6e-7.

x²= (1.3e-7)^2=1.69e-14.

So,

(1 - x)^2 = 1 - 2.6e-7 + 1.69e-14 ≈ 0.99999974 (since 1.69e-14 is negligible).

So, 1 - v²/c² = 0.00000026.

So, sqrt(0.00000026) = sqrt(2.6e-7) = sqrt(2.6) * sqrt(1e-7) = approx 1.612 * 3.1623e-4 ≈ 5.08e-4.

So, gamma =1/5.08e-4≈1968. So, t_astro=163000 /1968≈82.8 years.

Hmm, but the options don't have 83. The closest is C)81.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C)81 years.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects a time of approximately 81 years, considering that 163,000 / 1961≈83.12, but perhaps rounded down to 81.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different gamma value, perhaps 2000, leading to 163,000/2000=81.5.

So, the answer is approximately 81.5, which rounds to 81, option C.

Therefore, the correct answer is C)81 years.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how long the astronaut will experience the journey to Earth, we use the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation. The astronaut's proper time, \( \tau \), is related to the time measured in Earth's frame, \( t_{\text{Earth}} \), by the formula:

\[
\tau = t_{\text{Earth}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
\]

where \( v = 0.99999987c \) is the spacecraft's speed, and \( c \) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \) is first computed. Since \( v = 0.99999987c \), we calculate:

\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = (0.99999987)^2 \approx 0.99999974
\]

\[
1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} \approx 0.00000026
\]

\[
\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} = \sqrt{0.00000026} \approx 5.099 \times 10^{-4}
\]

Thus, \( \gamma = \frac{1}{5.099 \times 10^{-4}} \approx 1961 \).

### Step 2: Calculate \( t_{\text{Earth}} \)
The distance to Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is approximately \( 163,000 \) light-years. The time measured in Earth's frame is:

\[
t_{\text{Earth}} = \frac{\text{distance}}{v} = \frac{163,000 \, \text{ly}}{0.99999987c} \approx 163,000 \, \text{years}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \tau \)
Using the time dilation formula:

\[
\tau = t_{\text{Earth}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} = 163,000 \cdot 5.099 \times 10^{-4} \approx 83.1 \, \text{years}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with Options
The calculated proper time \( \tau \approx 83.1 \, \text{years} \) is closest to option **C) 81 years**. While the exact value is slightly higher, the problem likely expects rounding to the nearest provided option.

### Conclusion
The astronaut will experience approximately **81 years** during the journey. Since their average lifetime is 150 years and they are currently 22 years old, they will survive the trip.

ANSWER: C

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about space travel and time dilation. Let me break it down step by step.

The question is about an astronaut from an alien civilization traveling to Earth at a speed very close to the speed of light. The spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987 times the speed of light, which is super fast. The astronaut is 22 years old, and I need to find out how long the trip will take from their perspective. The options are various years and whether they die before reaching.

Wait, but I remember that when you travel at such high speeds, time dilation occurs. So, the astronaut's own experienced time (proper time) is different from the time measured by someone on Earth. Oh right, this is due to Einstein's theory of relativity, specifically the time dilation effect in special relativity.

So, the proper time (the time the astronaut experiences) is shorter than the time observed from Earth. The formula for time dilation is the Lorentz factor gamma, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, in this case, the astronaut's time is the proper time, so we need to calculate the Earth time and then find the proper time.

Wait, actually, the problem says the astronaut is 22 years old, and the question is about the time they experience. So, I think the approach is to calculate the time it takes to reach Earth from Earth's frame, and then apply time dilation to find the astronaut's experienced time.

Wait, but I might have to get the distance involved. Oh, wait, the distance from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure about the exact distance, but I think the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 to 200,000 light-years away. Let me check that. I remember that the Milky Way is about 100,000 light-years in diameter, and the LMC is a satellite galaxy, so maybe about 160,000 light-years? Let's go with approximately 163,000 light-years as the distance.

So, the spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987c. Let me calculate the time it takes from Earth's perspective. Time is distance divided by speed. So, t_earth = distance / speed.

Distance is 163,000 light-years. Speed is 0.99999987c, so the time is (163000 ly) / (0.99999987 c). Since one light-year is the distance light travels in a year, the time in years would be t_earth = 163000 / 0.99999987 ≈ roughly 163,000 * (1 / 0.99999987) ≈ approximately 163,000 * 1.00000013. So that's about 163,000 + (163000 * 0.00000013). Let me compute that: 163000 * 0.00000013 = 0.02119. So t_earth ≈ 163,000.02119 years. Approximately 163,000 years.

Wait, that's a really long time. But the astronaut's lifetime is only 150 solar years, but they are 22 now, so they have about 128 years left. Wait, but according to Earth time, it would take 163,000 years, but the astronaut's time is much shorter due to time dilation.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. So, the astronaut's experienced time is the Earth time multiplied by sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Because proper time is shorter. So, the time experienced, t_astro = t_earth * sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

Alternatively, using the Lorentz factor gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is 1/gamma. So, t_astro = t_earth / gamma.

But first, let me compute gamma. v is 0.99999987c. So v²/c² is (0.99999987)^2. Let's compute that. Let me compute (0.99999987)^2.

0.99999987 squared is approximately (1 - 0.00000013)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.00000013 + (0.00000013)^2 ≈ 0.99999974 (since 2e-7 is 0.0000002, but wait, more accurately, perhaps I should compute it as (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 ≈ 1 - 2.6e-7 + (1.69e-14) ≈ approximately 0.99999974. So, 1 - v²/c² ≈ 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026.

Wait no, wait: 1 - (v²/c²) = 1 - (0.99999987)^2.

Let me compute 0.99999987 * 0.99999987.

Calculating 0.99999987^2:

Let me think, (1 - x)^2 = 1 - 2x + x². Here, x is 0.00000013, because 1 - 0.99999987 = 0.00000013.

So, x=1.3e-7.

So, (1-x)^2 = 1 - 2x + x².

So, 2x is 2.6e-7, x squared is 1.69e-14, which is negligible.

So, 1 - 2x is approximately 1 - 2.6e-7 = 0.99999974.

So, 1 - v²/c² = 1 - (0.99999987)^2 = 1 - (1 - 2.6e-7) = 2.6e-7.

Wait, wait, no: wait, 1 - v²/c² is 1 - (0.99999987)^2 = 1 - (0.99999974) = 2.6e-7.

So, sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is sqrt(2.6e-7).

Wait, sqrt(2.6e-7) is approximately sqrt(2.6)*1e-3.5.

Wait, sqrt(2.6) is about 1.612, and 1e-3.5 is 1e-3 * 1e-0.5 = 1e-3 * (1/sqrt(10)) ≈ 3.16e-4.

So, 1.612 * 3.16e-4 ≈ 5.08e-4.

Wait, let me compute sqrt(2.6e-7) more accurately.

2.6e-7 = 2.6 x 10^-7.

The square root of 2.6 is approximately 1.612, and sqrt(1e-7) is 1e-3.5 = 3.162e-4.

So, 1.612 * 3.162e-4 ≈ 5.08e-4.

Alternatively, thinking in exponents: 2.6e-7 = 2.6 * 1e-7. The square root is sqrt(2.6) * 1e-3.5 = 1.612 * 3.162e-4 ≈ 5.08e-4.

So, sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ 5.08e-4.

So, gamma is 1/(5.08e-4) ≈ 1968. So, gamma is approximately 1968.

Wait, wait, wait, because 1e-3 is 0.001, and 5e-4 is 0.0005. So 1/0.0005 is 2000. So, since 5.08e-4 is a little more than 0.0005, the gamma would be a little less than 2000. Let's say about 1968.

But perhaps I should calculate it more accurately.

Wait, let me compute v = 0.99999987c.

So, v² = (0.99999987)^2 c².

So, 1 - v²/c² = 1 - (0.99999987)^2.

Let me compute that precisely.

Compute 0.99999987 * 0.99999987.

Compute 0.99999987^2:

Let me write it as (1 - 0.00000013)^2 = 1 - 2*0.00000013 + (0.00000013)^2.

Which is 1 - 0.00000026 + 1.69e-14.

So, 1 - 0.00000026 is 0.99999974.

So, 1 - v²/c² is 0.00000026.

Wait, 0.00000026 is 2.6e-7.

So, sqrt(2.6e-7) is sqrt(2.6)*1e-3.5.

As I calculated before, it's about 5.08e-4.

So, gamma is 1/(5.08e-4) ≈ 1968.5.

So, gamma ≈ 1968.5.

So, the proper time (time experienced by the astronaut) is t_astro = t_earth / gamma.

Wait, no. Wait, t_earth is the time measured in Earth's frame. The astronaut's proper time is t_astro = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = t_earth / gamma.

Because, t_astro = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = t_earth * (1/gamma).

Wait, no. Because gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is 1/gamma.

So, t_astro = t_earth * (1/gamma).

So, t_earth is the time measured on Earth, which is 163,000 years.

Wait, no, wait. Earlier, I thought the distance is 163,000 light-years. So, time from Earth's perspective is (163,000 light-years) / (0.99999987c) = 163000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163000 years.

Wait, that's a simplification. Wait, because light-year is distance, and speed is in terms of c, so the units work out. So, t_earth is 163000 / 0.99999987 ≈ about 163,000 years.

So, t_earth ≈ 163,000 years.

So, t_astro = (163,000 years) * (1/gamma) = 163,000 / 1968.5 ≈ let's compute that.

163,000 divided by 2000 is about 81.5. But since gamma is about 1968.5, which is a bit less than 2000, the division will be a bit higher.

Wait, 1968.5 is approximately 1968.5 = 2000 - 31.5.

So, 163000 / 1968.5 ≈ let's compute it.

163000 / 1968.5 ≈ let me approximate.

1968.5 times 80 is 1968.5 * 80 = 157,480.

Subtract that from 163,000: 163,000 - 157,480 = 5,520.

So, 1968.5 * x = 5,520.

x ≈ 5,520 / 1968.5 ≈ approximately 2.8.

So, total t_astro ≈ 80 + 2.8 ≈ 82.8 years.

Wait, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, 1968.5 * 82 = ?

Let me compute 1968.5 * 80 = 157,480.

1968.5 * 2 = 3,937.

So, 1968.5 * 82 = 157,480 + 3,937 = 161,417.

That's less than 163,000.

The difference is 163,000 - 161,417 = 1,583.

1,583 / 1968.5 ≈ approximately 0.803.

So, 82.803 years.

So, about 82.8 years.

Wait, but the astronaut is 22 years old. So, adding 82.8 years would make them 104.8 years old. But their average lifetime is 150 years. So, 104 is less than 150, so they would survive. Wait, but wait, the options don't have 82.8. The options are 72, 77, 81, etc.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the distance. Maybe the distance from the LMC to Earth is about 160,000 light-years. Let me double-check. Wait, I think the actual distance is approximately 163,000 light-years, but sometimes it's given as about 160,000 to 200,000. Let me check that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recompute using the exact gamma value.

Wait, maybe I should compute gamma more accurately.

Let me compute gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

v = 0.99999987c.

v² = (0.99999987)^2 c² = (approx) 0.9999997408 c².

So, 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9999997408 = 0.0000002592.

So, 2.592e-7.

So, sqrt(2.592e-7) = sqrt(2.592) * 1e-3.5.

sqrt(2.592) is about 1.610 (since 1.61^2 is 2.5921), yes. So, sqrt(2.592e-7) = 1.610 * 3.1623e-4.

Wait, 1e-3.5 is approximately 3.1623e-4. So, 1.610 * 3.1623e-4 ≈ 5.086e-4.

So, gamma ≈ 1 / 5.086e-4 ≈ 1966. So, gamma is approximately 1966.

So, t_astro = t_earth / gamma.

t_earth is 163000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 / (approx 1) ?

Wait, because 0.99999987 is very close to 1. So, 163000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163000 * (1 + 1.3e-7) ≈ 163000 + (163000 * 1.3e-7).

163000 * 1.3e-7 = 163000 * 1.3 * 1e-7 = (163000 * 1.3) * 1e-7.

163000 * 1.3 = 211,900.

So, 211900e-7 = 0.02119 years.

So, t_earth ≈ 163000.02119 years.

So, t_earth ≈ 163,000 years.

So, t_astro = 163,000 / 1966 ≈ let me compute that.

163,000 / 1966 ≈ let's see:

1966 * 80 = 157,280.

Subtract from 163,000: 163,000 - 157,280 = 5,720.

5,720 / 1966 ≈ 2.91 years.

So, total t_astro ≈ 80 + 2.91 = 82.91 years.

So, approximately 83 years.

But looking at the options, none of them are 83. The options are A, B, C, D: B is 72, C is 81, D is 77.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the distance. Maybe the distance is 160,000 light-years, not 163,000. Let me try that.

If the distance is 160,000 light-years, then t_earth = 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 * (1 + 1.3e-7) ≈ 160,000 + 0.0208 ≈ 160,000.0208 years.

Then, t_astro = 160,000 / 1966 ≈ let's compute:

1966 * 80 = 157,280.

Subtract from 160,000: 160,000 -157,280 = 2,720.

2,720 / 1966 ≈ 1.383.

So, t_astro ≈ 80 + 1.383 ≈ 81.383 years.

Which is approximately 81.4 years.

Looking at the options, option C is 81 years. So, that would be the answer.

But wait, the options are:

A) Astronaut dies before reaching.

B) 72

C) 81

D) 77

So, option C is 81 years.

Wait, but I thought the astronaut's lifetime is 150 years. They are 22, so 150 -22 = 128 years left.

If the trip takes 81 years, they would be 22 + 81 = 103, which is less than 150. So, they would survive.

But wait, the question is about whether the astronaut dies before reaching. Wait, in the options, option A says the astronaut will die before reaching Earth.

But according to our calculation, the experienced time is about 81 years, which is less than the astronaut's remaining lifetime of 128 years. So, they would live.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the distance. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem states that the aliens' average lifetime is roughly 150 solar years. So, our astronaut is 22 now, leaving about 128 years. But if the trip takes 81 years, they would arrive at 103 years old, which is within their lifespan. So, they would survive.

But looking at the options again, option A is "The astronaut will die before reaching Earth." So, that can't be correct unless the experienced time is longer than 128 years.

But according to the calculation, it's about 81 years, so option C would be correct. But wait, the options don't have 81 as a survival option. Or they do. Wait, the question is, how long will it take for the astronaut to reach Earth from their perspective.

In our calculation, it's about 81 years. So option C is the correct answer.

Wait, but I thought that when you're moving at a high speed, the distance is contracted. So, from the astronaut's perspective, the distance is shorter, so the time taken is less.

Wait, another approach: the distance from Earth is L = 163,000 light-years. From the astronaut's frame, the distance is L' = L * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = L * (1/gamma).

So, L' = 163,000 * (1/1966) ≈ 82.8 light-years.

So, the time experienced is L' / v = (82.8 ly) / (0.99999987c) ≈ 82.8 / 0.99999987 ≈ 82.8 years.

Which aligns with our previous calculation.

So, the astronaut's experienced time is about 82.8 years. So, the closest option is C) 81 years.

Wait, but why is the answer not 83, but 81? Maybe due to more precise distances or a more precise gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps the distance is around 170,000 light-years, but that would make the time longer.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recompute gamma more accurately.

Wait, v = 0.99999987c.

Let me compute v²/c² = (0.99999987)^2.

Compute 0.99999987 * 0.99999987.

Let me compute 0.99999987 as 1 - 1.3e-7.

So, (1 - a)^2 = 1 - 2a + a².

a = 1.3e-7.

So, (1 - a)^2 = 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2.

Which is 1 - 2.6e-7 + (1.69e-14).

So, approximately 0.99999974 (since 2.6e-7 is 0.00000026), so 1 - 0.00000026 = 0.99999974.

So, 1 - v²/c² = 0.00000026.

So, sqrt(0.00000026) = sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 5.099e-4.

So, gamma = 1 / 5.099e-4 ≈ 1961. So, more accurately, gamma is about 1961.

So, t_astro = 163,000 / 1961 ≈ let's compute that.

163,000 / 1961 ≈

Let me compute 1961 * 83 = ?

Well, 1960 * 83 = 162, 280? Wait, 1960 *80=156,800, 1960*3=5,880. So, 156,800+5,880=162,680. So, 1961 *83=162,680 +83=162,763.

Which is less than 163,000.

The difference is 163,000 -162,763 = 237.

237 / 1961 ≈ 0.1208.

So, t_astro ≈83.1208 years.

So, about 83 years.

Hmm, but the options don't have 83. So, perhaps I made an error in the distance.

Another approach: perhaps the time from Earth's perspective is (distance)/(v) = (163,000 ly) / (0.99999987c) ≈ 163000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 * (1 + 1.3e-7) ≈ 163,000 + 0.02119 ≈ 163,000.02119 years.

So, t_earth = 163,000.02 years.

t_astro = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 163,000.02 * (5.099e-4).

Compute 163000 * 5.099e-4.

163000 * 5.099e-4 = 163000 * 0.0005099.

Compute 163000 * 0.0005 = 81.5.

163000 * 0.0000099 = 1.6137.

So, 81.5 + 1.6137 ≈ 83.1137.

So, t_astro ≈83.11 years.

So, the astronaut would experience about 83 years.

But the options are 77, 72, 81, etc.

Hmm, perhaps my assumption about the distance is wrong. Maybe the LMC is 160,000 ly away.

If distance is 160,000 ly, t_earth = 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 * (1 + 1.3e-7) ≈160,000.0208 years.

t_astro = 160,000.0208 * 5.099e-4 ≈ 160000 * 0.0005099.

= 160000 * 0.0005 =80.

160000 * 0.0000099=1.584.

So, 80 +1.584=81.584 years.

Which is about 81.58 years.

Which rounds to 82, but the closest option is C)81.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact gamma is 1961, so 163000 /1961= approx 83, but perhaps the distance is 163,000 ly.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the actual distance to the LMC. From what I remember, the LMC is about 160,000 light-years away, but sometimes it's stated as approximately 170,000. Wait, perhaps the actual distance is 170,000 light-years.

If distance is 170,000 ly, t_earth=170000 /0.99999987≈170000 *1.00000013≈170,000.221 years.

t_astro=170000.221 *5.099e-4≈

170000 * 5.099e-4 = 170,000 *0.0005099 = 87.683.

So, t_astro ≈87.683 years.

Which is even longer than 83, but that's not among the options.

Wait, perhaps the distance is 140,000 ly. Then t_earth=140,000 /0.99999987 ≈140,000 *1.00000013≈140,000.196 years.

t_astro=140,000.196 *5.099e-4 ≈140,000 * 0.0005099 ≈71.386 years.

That's around 71 years, close to option B (72).

But I'm not sure about the exact distance. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects a different approach, ignoring the actual distance and using the time dilation formula in another way.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting us to use the formula for time experienced, which is t = t0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where t0 is the time measured from Earth.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for t_astro = (distance from LMC to Earth) * (sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) / v.

Which is the same as (distance) * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) / v.

Because, from Earth's frame, time is t0 = distance /v.

t_astro = t0 * sqrt(1 -v²/c²) = (distance /v ) * sqrt(...) = distance * sqrt(1 -v²/c²) / v.

Hmm, but that's the same as (distance / v) * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) ).

Wait, perhaps another approach: Calculate the time experienced by the astronaut using the proper time formula.

Proper time, tau, is given by tau = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So, with t_earth = distance /v.

So, tau = (distance /v) * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Which can be rewritten as distance * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) / v.

Which is the same as distance * (sqrt(1 -v^2/c^2)) / v.

So, perhaps compute that.

Again, let me plug in the numbers.

Assuming distance D=163,000 ly.

v=0.99999987c.

Compute sqrt(1 -v²/c²)=sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2)=sqrt(0.00000026)=5.099e-4.

So, tau = 163000 * 5.099e-4 / 0.99999987.

Wait, because v is 0.99999987c, so v=0.99999987 *c.

So, 1/v = 1/(0.99999987 *c) = (1/0.99999987) * (1/c).

So, tau = D * sqrt(1 -v²/c²) / (v) = D * sqrt(...) / (0.99999987 c).

But D is in light-years, and c is in ly/year. So, the units should work out.

Wait, perhaps more accurately:

D = 163,000 ly.

v = 0.99999987 c.

So, tau = D * sqrt(1 -v²/c²) / v.

Which is (163000 ly) * (5.099e-4) / (0.99999987 c).

But 1 ly per year is the speed of light, so c=1 ly/year.

So, tau = 163000 *5.099e-4 / 0.99999987.

Compute 163000 * 5.099e-4:

163000 * 0.0005099 = 83.0957.

Then divide by 0.99999987 (approx 1), so approximately 83.0957 years.

So, about 83 years.

But the options don't have 83, but option C is 81.

Hmm, perhaps I should use a more precise value for gamma.

Wait, let me compute gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 1961.

Wait, so tau = t_earth / gamma.

t_earth = D / v = (163000 ly) / (0.99999987c) ≈ 163000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163000.02 years.

tau = 163000.02 / 1961 ≈ 83.12 years.

Still around 83.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the intended approach is using only the time dilation factor, but perhaps the problem is designed with a different distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the actual distance is about 77 years multiplied by gamma.

Wait, because the options include 77, which is about 83 * (1966/2000). Hmm, maybe the problem uses a different approximation for gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects you to compute using the spaceship's speed as 0.99999987c, but to compute the time using the approximation that gamma is approximately 2e6 or some other figure, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me recompute gamma accurately.

v = 0.99999987c.

v² = (0.99999987)^2 c².

Compute this:

0.99999987 * 0.99999987.

Let me compute this precisely.

Let me write 0.99999987 = 1 - 0.00000013.

So, (1 - a)^2 = 1 - 2a + a², where a=0.00000013.

So, (0.99999987)^2 = 1 - 2*(0.00000013) + (0.00000013)^2 = 1 - 0.00000026 + 1.69e-14.

Which is approximately 0.99999974.

So, 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026.

So, sqrt(0.00000026) = sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 5.099e-4.

So, gamma = 1 / 5.099e-4 ≈ 1961.

So, gamma is correct.

So, the time experienced is about 83 years, but the options don't have that. So, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but since the options don't include 83, I must have made an error.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the distance is much shorter, or perhaps I should consider the spaceship's speed as 0.99999987c, and use the approximation that gamma is about 2000.

Using gamma = 2000:

t_astro = t_earth / 2000.

If t_earth is 163,000 years, then 163000 /2000 =81.5, which rounds to 82, but the closest option is C)81.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects a more approximate calculation, leading to 81 years.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about the distance. Let me think: the LMC is about 160,000 light-years away, but perhaps the problem states a different distance, such as 163,000, and the options are approximate.

So, the answer should be approximately 81 years, option C.

But wait, another approach: perhaps the time experienced is t_astro= t_earth * sqrt(1 -v²/c²).

So, t_earth= D/(v) = 163000/0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 years.

t_astro=163,000 * sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2) =163000 *5.099e-4 ≈83 years.

But again, none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the problem considers the distance as approximately 170,000 ly? If D=170,000 ly, t_earth=170,000/0.99999987≈170,000 years.

t_astro=170000 *5.099e-4≈86.7 years.

Still no option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the time experienced is approximately 83 years, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is A: the astronaut dies before reaching. But that contradicts because 83 <150-22=128.

So, perhaps the intended approach is different. Let me think.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the time from the astronaut's perspective without considering the actual distance, but rather using relative velocity and time dilation.

Wait, the problem says the spaceship is traveling at 0.99999987c. So, the time experienced by the astronaut is t_astro = t_earth * sqrt(1 -v^2/c^2).

But without the distance, how can we calculate t_earth?

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the distance is 1 light-year. But that can't be, because the LMC is much farther.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to be a trick question, because the spaceship's speed is so high that the time experienced is so small that the astronaut doesn't die.

Wait, but the options are about the time taken, not about whether they survive.

Wait, the question states: "how long will it take for their 22 years old astronaut (from the point of view of the astronaut) to reach the Earth using this incredibly fast spacecraft?"

So, the answer is the proper time experienced by the astronaut, which we calculated as about 83 years. But the options are 72, 77, 81, or die.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate the gamma calculation with more precise numbers.

Let me compute 0.99999987^2.

Using a calculator approach, but since I can't use a calculator, perhaps I can compute it more accurately.

Compute (0.99999987)^2.

We have:

(1 - x)^2 = 1 - 2x + x², where x=0.00000013 (since 1 -0.99999987=0.00000013).

So,

(1 - x)^2 = 1 - 2x + x².

x=1.3e-7.

So,

2x = 2.6e-7.

x²= (1.3e-7)^2=1.69e-14.

So,

(1 - x)^2 = 1 - 2.6e-7 + 1.69e-14 ≈ 0.99999974 (since 1.69e-14 is negligible).

So, 1 - v²/c² = 0.00000026.

So, sqrt(0.00000026) = sqrt(2.6e-7) = sqrt(2.6) * sqrt(1e-7) = approx 1.612 * 3.1623e-4 ≈ 5.08e-4.

So, gamma =1/5.08e-4≈1968. So, t_astro=163000 /1968≈82.8 years.

Hmm, but the options don't have 83. The closest is C)81.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C)81 years.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects a time of approximately 81 years, considering that 163,000 / 1961≈83.12, but perhaps rounded down to 81.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different gamma value, perhaps 2000, leading to 163,000/2000=81.5.

So, the answer is approximately 81.5, which rounds to 81, option C.

Therefore, the correct answer is C)81 years.


To determine how long the astronaut will experience the journey to Earth, we use the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation. The astronaut's proper time, \( \tau \), is related to the time measured in Earth's frame, \( t_{\text{Earth}} \), by the formula:

\[
\tau = t_{\text{Earth}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
\]

where \( v = 0.99999987c \) is the spacecraft's speed, and \( c \) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \) is first computed. Since \( v = 0.99999987c \), we calculate:

\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = (0.99999987)^2 \approx 0.99999974
\]

\[
1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} \approx 0.00000026
\]

\[
\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} = \sqrt{0.00000026} \approx 5.099 \times 10^{-4}
\]

Thus, \( \gamma = \frac{1}{5.099 \times 10^{-4}} \approx 1961 \).

### Step 2: Calculate \( t_{\text{Earth}} \)
The distance to Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is approximately \( 163,000 \) light-years. The time measured in Earth's frame is:

\[
t_{\text{Earth}} = \frac{\text{distance}}{v} = \frac{163,000 \, \text{ly}}{0.99999987c} \approx 163,000 \, \text{years}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \tau \)
Using the time dilation formula:

\[
\tau = t_{\text{Earth}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} = 163,000 \cdot 5.099 \times 10^{-4} \approx 83.1 \, \text{years}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with Options
The calculated proper time \( \tau \approx 83.1 \, \text{years} \) is closest to option **C) 81 years**. While the exact value is slightly higher, the problem likely expects rounding to the nearest provided option.

### Conclusion
The astronaut will experience approximately **81 years** during the journey. Since their average lifetime is 150 years and they are currently 22 years old, they will survive the trip.

ANSWER: C
