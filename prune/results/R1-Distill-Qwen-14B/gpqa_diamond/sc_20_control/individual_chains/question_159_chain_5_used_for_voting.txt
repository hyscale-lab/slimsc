Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this quasar question. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking. 

The question says that we're observing a quasar, and in the near-infrared and optical spectrum, there's a peak at about 790 nm. But when we look at wavelengths shorter than that (so bluer), the flux drops a lot. Hmm, I remember that when sources are very far away, their light gets redshifted. So if there's a peak at 790 nm, but the flux drops at shorter wavelengths, maybe the original emission is in the ultraviolet or optical, and after redshifting, it's shifted into the infrared. So the emission line is now at 790 nm, which is near-infrared.

Wait, I think that the Lyman-alpha emission line is in the ultraviolet for quasars. If it's redshifted to 790 nm, which is about 0.79 microns (since 1 micron is 1000 nm), that's about 7900 angstroms. Wait, no, wait: 790 nm is 7900 Angstroms? Wait, no. 1 nm is 10 Angstroms, so 790 nm is 7900 Angstroms. Wait, no, wait: 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm. So 790 nm is 7900 Angstroms. Oh wait, the Lyman-alpha line is at about 121.6 nm (1216 Angstroms), right? So if that's shifted to 790 nm, then the redshift z would be (observed wavelength / emitted wavelength) - 1. So z = (790 / 121.6) - 1. Let me calculate that.

790 divided by 121.6 is approximately 6.497. Subtract 1, so z is about 5.497. So z ≈5.5.

Now, the question asks about the comoving distance at scale factor a=1. So that's the distance today. Since the universe is expanding, the comoving distance depends on the integral of 1/(H0 * E(z)) dz from 0 to z, where E(z) is the expansion factor.

Wait, no, the comoving distance is given by the integral from 0 to z of c/(H0 * E(z')) dz', where E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m*(1+z)^3 + Ω_lambda). Since the universe is flat, Ω_r is negligible, so E(z) is sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3 + 0.7). 

So for z=5.5, we need to compute the integral from 0 to 5.5 of dz/(E(z)).

Hmm, but integrating that analytically is tricky. I think there's a standard approximation or table for comoving distances for various redshifts. Alternatively, I might remember some approximate values for comoving distances at different z's.

Wait, for example, at z=1, the comoving distance is about 2 Gpc. At higher z, it increases. Let me think. For z=2, I think it's around 4-5 Gpc. For z=5, it's much larger. Maybe around 10 Gpc? Or maybe more.

Wait, but wait, the Hubble constant given is 70 km/s/Mpc. So when calculating the comoving distance, the formula is (c/H0) * ∫ E(z)^-1 dz, but I think that's when E(z) is defined as the reciprocal of the square root. Or wait, let me get it right.

The comoving distance D_C is (c/H0) * ∫ from 0 to z of 1/(E(z')) dz', where E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m (1+z)^3 + Ω_Λ). Because H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc, but in the calculation, units have to be consistent. I might need to use H0 in terms of s^-1, but perhaps it's better to think in terms of H0 = 70 (km/s/Mpc) which is 70 / (3.086e19 km) ) per second. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I can use the approximation for comoving distance based on known cosmological parameters.

Alternatively, I can recall that for the standard Lambda-CDM model (with Ω_m = 0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7, flat), the comoving distance at redshift z is approximately given by certain expressions or can be estimated using look-up tables.

Alternatively, I can look for approximate values. Let me think: for z=5, what's the comoving distance? I remember that higher redshifts correspond to larger distances. For example, z=1 is about 2 Gpc, z=2 is around 6 Gpc, but wait, that's in a matter-dominated universe, perhaps. Or maybe I'm confusing with something else.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the approximation for the comoving distance. Let me consider that:

D_C = (c / H0) * ∫_0^z [1 / sqrt(Ω_m (1 + z')³ + Ω_lambda)] dz'

Hmm, integrating this numerically would be tedious, but perhaps there's a standard table or approximation.

Alternatively, I can use an online calculator or a standard formula. But since I can't do that right now, I'll try to think of some approximate values.

Wait, I found in some references that for a flat Λ-CDM universe with Ω_m=0.3 and Ω_Λ=0.7, the comoving distance at redshift z is approximately given by:

D_C ≈ (c / H0) * f(z)

where f(z) is a function that depends on z. For z=5, f(z) is roughly... Let me think, I remember that for z=1, f(z)=0.623; for z=2, f(z)=1.3; for z=3, f(z)=1.89; z=4, f(z)=2.41; z=5, f(z)=2.87; and so on.

Wait, but wait, I think these are the values for the integral ∫_0^z dz'/(E(z') ), multiplied by c/H0. So if at z=5, f(z)=2.87, then D_C = (c/H0) * 2.87.

But wait, c is the speed of light, approximately 3e5 km/s. H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc. So c/H0 = (3e5 km/s) / (70 km/s/Mpc) ) = approx (3e5 /70 ) Mpc = approx 4285.7 Mpc, or about 4.286 Gpc.

So D_C ≈ 4.286 Gpc * f(z). For z=5, f(z)=2.87, so D_C ≈4.286 * 2.87 ≈ around 12.2 Gpc.

Wait, but that's a problem because the options given are up to 9 Gpc. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the f(z) value. Maybe the function f(z) is different. Alternatively, perhaps I'm remembering the values incorrectly.

Wait, another approach: I'll try to compute the integral numerically, but that's time-consuming. Alternatively, I can use the approximation formula.

Wait, another thought: for high redshifts (z >> 1), the expansion is dominated by dark energy, so the integral converges. For z=5.5, how much is the integral?

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation that for z > 1, the comoving distance can be approximated as:

D_C ≈ (c / H0) * [ (2/(3*sqrt(Ω_m))) ) * (1 + (1 - (1 - q0)/2 (1 + 1/z) )) ) ] 

Wait, no, that's probably for other purposes. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation for the age of the universe, but that's not directly helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can use the approximation that when dark energy dominates (z not too high), the comoving distance scales roughly as sqrt(z) or something. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look for approximate comoving distances for z=5.5 in the given cosmology.

Wait, I found online that for the standard cosmology (Ω_m=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7), the comoving distance to redshift z=5 is approximately 15 Gpc. But that's much higher than the options given. Hmm, that can't be right because the options are up to 9 Gpc. So maybe I'm misremembering.

Wait, another approach: let's think about luminosity distance and flux. The peak in the spectrum is the Lyman-alpha emission line redshifted. The flux drops at shorter wavelengths, which suggests that the original emission was at a certain rest wavelength, and the observed wavelength is longer, hence redshift.

Assuming that the quasar's Lyman-alpha line is at 121.6 nm rest frame, observed at 790 nm, so z=(790 / 121.6) -1 = approx 5.49.

So z≈5.5.

Now, the comoving distance D_C is given by:

D_C = (c / H0) * ∫_0^z [1 / sqrt(Ω_m (1 + z')^3 + Ω_Λ)} ] dz'

Given H0=70 km/s/Mpc, so c=3e5 km/s.

So c/H0 = (3e5) / 70 ≈ 4285.7 Mpc, which is about 4.286 Gpc.

So D_C = 4.286 Gpc * ∫_0^5.5 [1 / sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 + 0.7)} ] dz'

Now, to compute this integral. Hmm, I'll try to approximate it by breaking the integral into intervals.

Let me compute E(z') = sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 + 0.7)

At z' = 0: E= sqrt(0.3 +0.7)=1 → 1/E=1.

z'=1: E= sqrt(0.3*(8) +0.7)= sqrt(2.4 +0.7)=sqrt(3.1)=~1.761 → 1/E≈0.567.

z'=2: E= sqrt(0.3*(27)+0.7)= sqrt(8.1 +0.7)=sqrt(8.8)=~2.966 → 1/E≈0.337.

z'=3: E= sqrt(0.3*64 +0.7)= sqrt(19.2 +0.7)=sqrt(19.9)=~4.461 → 1/E≈0.224.

z'=4: E= sqrt(0.3*125 +0.7)= sqrt(37.5 +0.7)=sqrt(38.2)=~6.18 → 1/E≈0.1618.

z'=5: E= sqrt(0.3*216 +0.7)= sqrt(64.8 +0.7)=sqrt(65.5)=~8.093 → 1/E≈0.1236.

z'=5.5: E= sqrt(0.3*(5.5+1)^3 +0.7)= sqrt(0.3*(6.5)^3 +0.7). 6.5^3 is 274.625 → 0.3*274.625=82.3875. So E= sqrt(82.3875 +0.7) = sqrt(83.0875)= ~9.115 → 1/E≈0.1097.

Now, I can approximate the integral by summing over these points, using the trapezoidal rule or simply averaging the function values at each interval.

Let me break the integral from 0 to 5.5 into intervals of 1 each. So the intervals are 0-1, 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-5.5.

For each interval, the width is Δz=1 (except last, which is 0.5).

Compute the average 1/E in each interval:

0-1: average of 1 and 0.567 → (1 + 0.567)/2 = 0.7835.

1-2: average of 0.567 and 0.337 → 0.452.

2-3: average of 0.337 and 0.224 → 0.2805.

3-4: average of 0.224 and 0.1618 → 0.1929.

4-5: average of 0.1618 and 0.1236 → 0.1427.

5-5.5: average of 0.1236 and 0.1097 → 0.1167.

Now, each interval contributes (average 1/E) * Δz (Δz=1 except last which is 0.5).

So the sum would be:

0.7835 * 1 = 0.7835

0.452 *1 = 0.452

0.2805 *1 =0.2805

0.1929 *1=0.1929

0.1427 *1=0.1427

0.1167 *0.5=0.05835

Adding these up:

0.7835 + 0.452 = 1.2355

+0.2805 → 1.516

+0.1929 → 1.7089

+0.1427 → 1.8516

+0.05835 → 1.90995.

So the integral from 0 to 5.5 is approximately 1.91.

But wait, this is a rough approximation because I'm taking the average of the endpoints, which might not account for the curvature of the function. The actual function 1/E(z) decreases as z increases, so the trapezoidal rule overestimates the area because the function is concave. Alternatively, using the midpoint rule might give a better estimate. But for the sake of this problem, let's proceed.

So, D_C = (4.286 Gpc) * 1.91 ≈ 8.2 Gpc.

Looking at the options, option B is 8 Gpc, which is close. So the answer would be (B) 8 Gpc.

Wait, but wait. Let me check another method. I found that for z=5.5 and Ω_m=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7, the comoving distance is approximately 12 Gpc. But that's not among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the integral calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a more accurate method. Another approach is to use online calculators or tables. For example, according to some sources, the comoving distance for z=5.5 in the given cosmology is about 13 Gpc. But again, the options don't go that high.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me rethink. The peak at 790 nm could be the Lyman-alpha line, but perhaps it's another line. Wait, if the peak is at 790 nm, which is near-infrared, maybe it's the rest-frame optical emission line like H-alpha, which is at 656 nm. So if H-alpha is at 656 nm rest, and we observe it at 790 nm, then z=(790/656)-1 ≈ (1.2038) -1 = 0.2038. So z≈0.2, which is much lower. But then the comoving distance would be much less, around a few Gpc.

But that contradicts the previous assumption. So which scenario is correct?

Wait, the question says that the flux drops significantly at wavelengths shorter than 790 nm, implying that the peak is the highest in the observed spectrum. If the quasar's redshift is high, then the peak would be in the infrared. For example, if Lyman-alpha is emitted at 121.6 nm, and observed at 790 nm, that's a high redshift.

Alternatively, if the quasar's emission line is at H-beta (around 486 nm) and is observed at 790 nm, then z= (790/486)-1≈1.62-1=0.62.

But the question states that the flux drops at shorter wavelengths, so maybe the peak is the highest in the observed frame. For a high-redshift object, the flux at shorter wavelengths (bluer) would be less because the original emission is in the UV, which is heavily redshifted.

So maybe the initial assumption of z≈5.5 is correct.

But then why the comoving distance for z=5.5 would be 8 Gpc? Because earlier, using a rough integral, I got 1.91, leading to D_C≈8 Gpc. But according to some sources, it's higher.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the formulas. Another thought: perhaps the comoving distance for z=5.5 is about 12 Gpc, but the options don't have that. So maybe I made a mistake in the integral approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the luminosity distance instead of comoving distance. But no, the question states comoving distance (for a=1). So, D_C is correct.

Wait, let me try using a better approximation. I found a calculator online (though I can't access it right now) that for z=5.5, the comoving distance in a flat ΛCDM model with Ω_m=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7 is approximately 14.6 Gpc. But that's not an option either. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the redshift. Let me recalculate z.

Observed wavelength λ_obs=790 nm, emitted wavelength λ_emit=121.6 nm (Lyman-alpha).

z = (λ_obs / λ_emit) -1 = (790/121.6) -1.

790 / 121.6 is approximately 6.497, so z=5.497.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise calculation.

790 / 121.6 = ?

Let me compute 121.6 * 6 = 729.6 → 790-729.6=60.4 → 60.4 / 121.6 ≈ 0.497. So total is 6.497, so z=5.497.

So the redshift is approximately 5.5.

Now, perhaps the comoving distance for this z is around 13 Gpc, but that's not an option. So what's going on?

Wait, the options are A)6, B)8, C)9, D)7.

If I'm getting 8 Gpc from my rough integral, but I thought the actual is around 13 Gpc, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing the comoving distance with the luminosity distance.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the formula for comoving distance again.

The comoving distance D_C is given by:

D_C = (c / H0) * ∫_0^z [1 / sqrt(Ω_m*(1+z')³ + Ω_lambda)} ] dz'

Given Ω_m=0.3, Ω_lambda=0.7, H0=70.

So I can try to compute this integral numerically using more points.

Let me try with more z' intervals.

Let me compute E(z') = sqrt(0.3*(1+z')³ +0.7) for various z', and then compute 1/E(z').

Let me create a table for z' from 0 to 5.5, stepping by 0.5 each time.

z' | (1+z') | (1+z')^3 | 0.3*(1+z')^3 | 0.3*(1+z')^3 +0.7 | E(z')=sqrt() | 1/E(z')
---|-------|---------|-------------|---------------------|-------------|-------
0.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 0.3 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0
0.5 | 1.5 | 3.375 | 1.0125 | 1.7125 | 1.309 | 0.764
1.0 | 2.0 | 8.0 | 2.4 | 3.1 | 1.761 | 0.567
1.5 | 2.5 | 15.625 | 4.6875 | 4.0875 | 2.0218 | 0.4948
2.0 | 3.0 | 27.0 |8.1 |8.8 |2.966 |0.337
2.5 |3.5 |42.875 |12.8625 |12.8625+0.7=13.5625 → sqrt=3.682 → 1/3.682≈0.2716
3.0 |4.0 |64 → 19.2 → +0.7=19.9 → sqrt≈4.461 → 0.224
3.5 |4.5 → 91.125 → 27.3375 → +0.7=28.0375 → sqrt≈5.295 → 0.189
4.0 |5.0 → 125 →37.5 →+0.7=38.2 → sqrt≈6.18 →0.1618
4.5 |5.5 → 166.375 →49.9125 →+0.7=50.6125 →sqrt=7.115 →0.1406
5.0 |6.0 →216 →64.8 →+0.7=65.5 →sqrt≈8.093 →0.1236
5.5 |6.5 →274.625 →82.3875 →+0.7=83.0875 →sqrt≈9.115 →0.1097

Now, let's use the trapezoidal rule for the integral, using steps of 0.5. The function is 1/E(z'), and the width of each interval is 0.5.

The trapezoidal rule for each step is (f(z') + f(z'+Δz)) * Δz / 2.

So:

From 0 to 0.5: (1.0 + 0.764) * 0.5 /2 = (1.764 * 0.5)/2 = 0.882 /2 = 0.441

From 0.5 to 1.0: (0.764 + 0.567) *0.5 /2 → (1.331*0.5)/2=0.6655/2=0.33275 → approx 0.333

From 1.0 to 1.5: (0.567 +0.4948)*0.5/2 → (1.0618 *0.5)/2=0.5309/2=0.26545 → ~0.265

From 1.5 to 2.0: (0.4948 +0.337) *0.5/2 → (0.8318 *0.5)/2=0.4159/2=0.20795 → ~0.208

From 2.0 to 2.5: (0.337 +0.2716)*0.5/2 → (0.6086 *0.5)/2=0.3043/2=0.15215 → ~0.152

From 2.5 to 3.0: (0.2716 +0.224)*0.5/2 → (0.4956 *0.5)/2=0.2478/2=0.1239 → ~0.124

From 3.0 to 3.5: (0.224 +0.189)*0.5/2 → (0.413 *0.5)/2=0.2065/2=0.10325 → ~0.103

From 3.5 to4.0: (0.189 +0.1618)*0.5/2 → (0.3508 *0.5)/2=0.1754/2=0.0877 → ~0.0877

From4.0 to4.5: (0.1618 +0.1406)*0.5/2 → (0.3024 *0.5)/2=0.1512/2=0.0756 → ~0.0756

From4.5 to5.0: (0.1406 +0.1236)*0.5/2 → (0.2642 *0.5)/2=0.1321/2=0.06605 → ~0.066

From5.0 to5.5: (0.1236 +0.1097)*0.5/2 → (0.2333 *0.5)/2=0.11665/2=0.058325 → ~0.0583

Now, sum all these contributions:

0.441
+0.333 → 0.774
+0.265 →1.039
+0.208 →1.247
+0.152 →1.399
+0.124 →1.523
+0.103 →1.626
+0.0877 →1.7137
+0.0756 →1.7893
+0.066 →1.8553
+0.0583 →1.9136

So the integral from 0 to 5.5 is approximately 1.9136.

Then D_C = (4.286 Gpc) * 1.9136 ≈ 8.20 Gpc.

Which would be approximately 8 Gpc, so option B.

But earlier I thought that the actual comoving distance for z=5.5 is around 13 Gpc. So maybe I'm missing a factor. Wait, perhaps I forgot that the integral is multiplied by c/(H0), but maybe H0 is in km/s/Mpc, and I didn't convert it properly.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation of c/H0.

H0=70 km/s/Mpc.

c=3e5 km/s.

So c/H0 = (3e5) /70 ≈ 4285.7 Mpc → 4.286 Gpc.

Yes, that's correct.

So with the integral being 1.9136, D_C=4.286 *1.9136≈8.20 Gpc.

So the correct answer would be approximately 8 Gpc, which is option B.

But wait, another thought: perhaps the peak at 790 nm isn't Lyman-alpha but another line. For example, the Balmer series. H-alpha is at 656 nm rest frame. If observed at 790, then z= (790/656)-1≈0.2038. So z≈0.2.

In that case, the comoving distance would be much lower.

Let me compute that.

z=0.2.

Compute the integral from 0 to 0.2.

E(z')=sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 +0.7)

At z'=0 → E=1 →1/E=1.

z'=0.2 → E= sqrt(0.3*(1.2)^3 +0.7) → 1.2^3=1.728 →0.3*1.728=0.5184 → 0.5184 +0.7=1.2184 → sqrt≈1.1038 →1/E≈0.906.

So using trapezoidal rule for interval 0→0.2 (Δz=0.2):

Integral ≈ (1 +0.906)*0.2/2 = (1.906 *0.1) =0.1906.

So D_C=4.286 Gpc *0.1906≈0.816 Gpc, which is 816 Mpc. That's much lower than the options, so the initial assumption that the peak is Lyman-alpha at z≈5.5 is correct.

So the comoving distance is approximately 8 Gpc, so the correct option is B) 8 Gpc.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the comoving distance of the quasar from Earth, we analyze the given data and apply cosmological principles.

### Key Observations and Calculations:
1. **Observed Wavelength and Redshift**:  
   The quasar's peak is observed at a wavelength of 790 nm. Assuming this corresponds to the Lyman-alpha emission line, which has a rest wavelength of 121.6 nm, the redshift \( z \) is calculated as:  
   \[
   z = \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}}}{\lambda_{\text{emit}}} - 1 = \frac{790}{121.6} - 1 \approx 5.497
   \]

2. **Comoving Distance Formula**:  
   The comoving distance \( D_C \) is given by:  
   \[
   D_C = \frac{c}{H_0} \int_0^z \frac{1}{\sqrt{\Omega_m (1+z')^3 + \Omega_\Lambda}} \, dz'
   \]  
   where \( c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s} \), \( H_0 = 70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc} \), \( \Omega_m = 0.3 \), and \( \Omega_\Lambda = 0.7 \).  

3. **Precomputation of \( c/H_0 \)**:  
   \[
   \frac{c}{H_0} = \frac{3 \times 10^5}{70} \approx 4285.7 \, \text{Mpc} = 4.286 \, \text{Gpc}
   \]

4. **Integral Approximation**:  
   The integral \( \int_0^z \frac{1}{\sqrt{\Omega_m (1+z')^3 + \Omega_\Lambda}} \, dz' \) is approximated using the trapezoidal rule. Breaking the integral into intervals of \( \Delta z = 0.5 \) (except the last interval, which is \( \Delta z = 0.5 \)), the function \( E(z') = \sqrt{\Omega_m (1+z')^3 + \Omega_\Lambda} \) is evaluated at each point, and the contributions to the integral are summed.  

   After performing the calculations, the integral evaluates to approximately \( 1.91 \).

5. **Final Comoving Distance**:  
   Using the precomputed \( c/H_0 \) and the integral result:  
   \[
   D_C = 4.286 \, \text{Gpc} \times 1.91 \approx 8.2 \, \text{Gpc}
   \]

### Conclusion:
The comoving distance of the quasar is approximately \( 8 \, \text{Gpc} \), which corresponds to option **B**.

ANSWER: B
