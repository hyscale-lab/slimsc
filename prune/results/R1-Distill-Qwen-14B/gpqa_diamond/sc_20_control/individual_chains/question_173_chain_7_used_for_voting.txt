Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. The question is about the uncertainty principle, which I remember is related to quantum mechanics. The problem says that an electron is moving at a speed v = 2e8 m/s along the x-direction, and the uncertainty in its position, Δx, is 0.1 nanometers. I need to find the minimum uncertainty in its energy, ΔE.

Hmm, I think this involves the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. I remember that the principle states that you can't simultaneously know both the position and momentum of a particle with absolute certainty. The formula I think is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. But wait, the question is about energy uncertainty. So how does that tie in?

Oh wait, I think there's another form of the uncertainty principle involving energy and time. But wait, this question is about spatial uncertainty and energy, so maybe I need to relate it through momentum. Because energy is related to momentum, right? For a particle, kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m), where m is mass.

So maybe I can find the uncertainty in momentum first using the uncertainty principle, then use that to find the uncertainty in energy.

Let me write down what I know. The uncertainty in position is Δx = 0.1 nm. Wait, 0.1 nm is 0.1e-9 meters, or 1e-10 meters. The speed is 2e8 m/s, but I'm not sure if I need the speed yet. Oh wait, maybe I can find the momentum uncertainty from the position uncertainty. So Δp is approximately ħ/(2Δx). Or wait, the uncertainty principle is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, so the minimum uncertainty would be when they're equal, so Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx).

Wait, okay, let's compute Δp. The Planck constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s, so ħ is h/(2π) ≈ 1.05457e-34 J·s. Let me calculate 1.05457e-34 divided by (2 * 1e-10 m). So 2Δx is 2 * 1e-10 = 2e-10 m. So Δp ≈ (1.05457e-34) / (2e-10) = approximately 5.27e-25 kg·m/s. Wait, let me compute that again: 1e-34 / 2e-10 is 0.5e-24, which is 5e-25, but with the 1.05457 factor, maybe around 5.27e-25 kg m/s. So Δp ≈ 5.27e-25 kg m/s.

Now, how do I find the uncertainty in energy ΔE? Well, the kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m), so the uncertainty in energy would be (Δp²)/(2m). Wait, but I think I need to be careful here. Because the uncertainty in energy is related to the uncertainty in momentum. Alternatively, perhaps using the uncertainty principle between energy and time, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach here.

Wait, another thought: the uncertainty in energy can be found using the momentum uncertainty. Since KE = p²/(2m), the uncertainty in KE would be approximately (Δp)^2/(2m). Because Δp is small compared to p, so the square should be okay.

So substituting Δp ≈ 5.27e-25 kg m/s, and m is the mass of the electron. The mass of an electron is about 9.11e-31 kg. Let me plug in the numbers.

ΔE ≈ (5.27e-25)^2 / (2 * 9.11e-31). Let me compute the numerator first: (5.27e-25)^2 is approximately (5.27)^2 = 27.77, so 27.77e-50 = 2.777e-49. Then denominator is 2 *9.11e-31 = 1.822e-30.

So ΔE ≈ (2.777e-49) / (1.822e-30) = approximately 1.524e-19 J. Wait, that's approximately 1.5e-19 J. Looking at the options, option C is ~1e-19 J, which is close. Hmm.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Let me redo the calculation more carefully.

Compute Δp = ħ/(2Δx). So ħ is 1.05457e-34 J·s. So 2Δx is 2 * 1e-10 m = 2e-10 m. So Δp = (1.05457e-34) / (2e-10) = 5.27285e-25 kg m/s.

Now, Δp squared is (5.27285e-25)^2. Let me calculate that. 5.27285 squared is approximately (5^2 is 25, 0.27285^2 is about 0.0744, and cross terms are 2*5*0.27285=2.7285. So 5.27285^2 ≈ 27.8, so 27.8e-50? Wait, no. Wait, (e-25)^2 is e-50. So 5.27285e-25 squared is (5.27285)^2 = 27.8, so 27.8e-50 = 2.78e-49.

Then, 2m is 2 * 9.10938e-31 kg = 1.821876e-30 kg.

So ΔE = (2.78e-49) / (1.821876e-30) = approximately 1.525e-19 J.

Wait, that's 1.5e-19 J. So that would be approximately 1e-19 J, looking at the options. Option C is ~1e-19 J. So that's the answer.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me think again. Is this approach correct? Because the uncertainty principle gives the minimum uncertainty in position and momentum, but when relating to energy, I'm using the kinetic energy formula. But perhaps I should think in terms of the uncertainty principle for energy and time, but that's when you have a time uncertainty. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute ΔE using the momentum uncertainty via the relation between energy and momentum.

Alternatively, another approach: the minimum uncertainty in energy is given by ΔE ≥ ħ Δω, where Δω is the uncertainty in angular frequency. But I'm not sure how that ties in here. Alternatively, perhaps the energy uncertainty is directly related to the momentum uncertainty via ΔE = (Δp)^2/(2m), which is the approach I took.

Wait, I think that's a valid approach because the kinetic energy is p²/(2m), so if p has an uncertainty Δp, the energy uncertainty ΔE would be approximately (Δp)^2/(2m). So the calculation I did should be correct.

So the result is about 1.5e-19 J, which is closest to option C, which is ~1e-19 J. So the answer should be C.

To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of an electron, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and the relationship between momentum and kinetic energy. The uncertainty in position is given as Δx = 0.1 nm = \(1 \times 10^{-10}\) m. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states:

\[
\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \(\hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi} \approx 1.05457 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\). For the minimum uncertainty, we assume equality:

\[
\Delta p \approx \frac{\hbar}{2\Delta x}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta p \approx \frac{1.05457 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 1 \times 10^{-10}} = 5.27 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
\]

Next, the kinetic energy of a particle is related to its momentum by:

\[
E = \frac{p^2}{2m}.
\]

The uncertainty in energy \(\Delta E\) can be approximated as:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{(\Delta p)^2}{2m},
\]

where \(m = 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg}\) is the mass of the electron. Substituting \(\Delta p = 5.27 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s}\) and \(m = 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg}\):

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{(5.27 \times 10^{-25})^2}{2 \times 9.11 \times 10^{-31}}.
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
(5.27 \times 10^{-25})^2 = 2.78 \times 10^{-49}.
\]

Then, calculate the denominator:

\[
2 \times 9.11 \times 10^{-31} = 1.82 \times 10^{-30}.
\]

Now, divide:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{2.78 \times 10^{-49}}{1.82 \times 10^{-30}} = 1.52 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

This value is approximately \(1.5 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\), which is closest to option \(C\) (\(~10^{-19} \, \text{J})\). Therefore, the minimum uncertainty in the energy of the electron is best represented by option \(C\).
