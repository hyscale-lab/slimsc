Okay, so I have this question about organic chemistry, specifically about dyes and the light they emit. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step.

The question says that a textile dye with an extensively conjugated pi-electron system emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV. I need to find out which color of light is absorbed by the compound. The options are Red, Violet, Blue, Yellow.

Wait, I remember something about the energy of light and its wavelength being related. Oh right, the energy of a photon is inversely proportional to its wavelength. The formula is E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength. 

So the energy given is 2.3393 eV. I think I should convert that into wavelength to find out the color. Because each color corresponds to a specific wavelength range. For example, red is around 650-700 nm, violet is 380-450 nm, blue is 450-495 nm, and yellow is 570-590 nm or something like that.

Wait, but wait a second. The question says the dye emits light at that energy. Oh, right, when a molecule absorbs light, it gets excited, and then it emits light when it goes back down. So the emitted light's energy corresponds to the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state. But wait, the emitted light's energy is what we're given. Oh, so the energy emitted is the energy difference. But wait, no, wait. The energy of the emitted photon is equal to the energy gap between the two states. So if the molecule emits a photon of energy E, that's the energy that was released when it relaxed. But what about absorption? The molecule absorbs a photon of higher energy than that, right? Because it needs to get excited to a higher energy state.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the electromagnetic spectrum. Visible light is from about 380 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). The energy of the photon is inversely proportional to wavelength. So higher energy corresponds to shorter wavelength.

So if the emitted light is 2.3393 eV, that would correspond to a certain wavelength. Let me calculate that. How do I convert eV to wavelength?

The formula is E (eV) = 1240 / λ (nm). So λ = 1240 / E.

Plugging in E=2.3393 eV:

λ = 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ let me calculate that.

1240 divided by 2.3393. Hmm, 2.3393 is approximately 2.34. So 1240 / 2.34 ≈ 529.9 nm. So about 530 nm.

What color is 530 nm? Let me think. The visible spectrum:

- Violet: ~380-450 nm
- Blue: ~450-495 nm
- Green: ~495-570 nm
- Yellow: ~570-590 nm
- Orange: ~590-620 nm
- Red: ~620-700 nm

Wait, so 530 is in the green region. Wait, but wait, the question is about the color absorbed. So if the compound emits light at 530 nm, which is green, then what color did it absorb?

Wait, no. I'm getting confused. Let me rethink. When a dye absorbs light, it's because the energy of the photon matches the energy gap between the molecule's states. So the absorbed photon's energy corresponds to the energy difference. Then, when it relaxes, it emits a photon of lower energy (since some energy is lost, maybe as heat or maybe because it doesn't transition all the way back?).

Wait, no, that's not quite right. The energy of the emitted photon plus the energy of any photon emitted during other transitions (like in fluorescence) might add up to the absorbed photon's energy. But wait, for simplicity, maybe the energy of the emitted photon is in the same range as the absorbed photon? Or perhaps it's a different energy because the molecule might have multiple excited states.

Wait, maybe I should think about this in terms of the absorption and emission spectrum.

In fluorescence, the molecule absorbs a photon of higher energy (higher frequency, shorter wavelength) and emits a photon of lower energy (longer wavelength). So the emitted photon has lower energy than the absorbed one.

So if the compound emits at 2.3393 eV, then the absorbed photon must have higher energy (lower wavelength) than that.

Wait, but wait, let me clarify. The absorption happens when the molecule goes from a lower energy state (ground state) to a higher energy state (excited state). The energy of the photon absorbed is E_abs = E_excited - E_ground.

Then, when the molecule relaxes, it emits a photon. The emitted photon's energy is E_emit = E_excited - E_emitted_state, which could be a lower energy state than the ground state, but in many cases, it's just a lower excited state.

But for the purpose of this question, perhaps the emission is due to fluorescence, which is when the molecule goes from a higher excited state to a lower one, emitting a photon. So in that case, the energy of the emitted photon is E_emit = E_high_excited - E_low_excited.

But the absorption would have been for E_abs = E_high_excited - E_ground. So E_abs is larger than E_emit.

Wait, so if the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, the absorbed photon must be higher than that. So the absorbed photon has higher energy than 2.3393 eV. Therefore, the wavelength of the absorbed photon is shorter than that of the emitted photon.

So the emitted photon's wavelength is 530 nm (green), so the absorbed photon would be shorter than that. Let's calculate the wavelength for the absorbed photon.

Wait, but wait, how much higher is E_abs than E_emit? Well, depending on the exact states, but maybe for this problem, it's sufficient to know that the emitted photon is lower in energy than the absorbed.

So, the emitted photon is green (530 nm is green), so the absorbed photon must be higher in energy (lower wavelength) than green. So that would be blue (around 450-495 nm), violet (380-450), perhaps.

Wait, wait. Let me think about colors. The colors of absorbed light are the ones not transmitted or reflected. So the dye would appear the color that's complementary to the absorbed color. For example, if it absorbs blue, it would reflect the complementary color, which is orange. Wait, but that's about color appearance, not the absorbed photon's color.

Wait, no. The question is directly asking what color of light is absorbed. So if the emitted light is green, the absorbed light must be higher energy (shorter wavelength) than green. So it would be blue or violet.

But let me calculate what wavelength corresponds to 2.3393 eV for the emission. So 530 nm is green. So the absorbed photon must have higher energy, which is lower wavelength. So the absorbed color would be in the blue or violet range.

Wait, but if the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, let's see what other colors correspond to that energy.

Wait, no. The emission is 2.3393 eV. So the absorption is higher energy. So the absorption would be in the UV or blue/violet range.

Wait, the options are A) Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow.

So the absorbed photon must have higher energy than 2.3393 eV. So the wavelength would be shorter than 530 nm. So that would be in the blue or violet range.

So the possible options are B and C.

But which one?

Wait, let's calculate the energy of light in the violet and blue regions.

Violet is about 380-450 nm. Let's take 400 nm as an example. E = 1240 / 400 ≈ 3.1 eV.

Blue is around 450-495 nm. Let's say 450 nm. E=1240/450≈2.755 eV.

So the emitted photon is at 2.3393 eV, which is 530 nm (green). The absorbed photon must be higher than 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed photon's energy must be higher than 2.3393 eV.

So if the absorbed photon is, say, 3.1 eV (violet, 400 nm), that's higher than 2.3393. Alternatively, if it's 2.755 eV (blue, 450 nm), that's also higher.

But the options are B and C: Violet and Blue.

So which one is the correct one?

Wait, the question states that the compound has an extensively conjugated pi-electron system. Extensive conjugation usually leads to lower energy gaps (because longer conjugation delocalizes electrons more, lowers the energy gap). So the energy required for absorption would be lower? Or wait, no. Wait, no, longer conjugation leads to lower energy gaps, so the absorption would be at a longer wavelength (lower energy). Wait, no, wait.

Wait, conjugation increases the extent of delocalization, which lowers the energy gap between HOMO and LUMO. So lower energy is required for excitation. So the absorption maximum shifts to longer wavelengths (lower energy) as conjugation increases. So more conjugation → redshift (bathochromic shift).

So if the molecule has extensive conjugation, the absorbed photon would be of lower energy than a less conjugated molecule. Wait, but in this case, the emission is 2.3393 eV, which is lower than the absorption energy.

Ah, wait. No, the absorption energy is higher than the emission energy. So the emission energy is 2.3393 eV. The absorption energy must be higher than that. So if the molecule has more conjugation, the absorption maximum would be at longer wavelengths (lower energy). But higher energy would be shorter wavelengths. Wait, this is getting a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the energy difference. The energy difference between the ground and excited state (absorption) is higher than the energy difference between the excited and another state (emission). So E_abs = E_emit + something (maybe the energy lost in the process, like in fluorescence efficiency).

But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, if the molecule emits at a lower energy than it absorbed, then the absorbed photon must have higher energy. So the absorbed photon is higher in energy than the emitted one. Given that, the absorption is in a higher energy (lower wavelength) than the emission.

So emitted is 2.3393 eV (green, 530 nm). The absorption must be higher than that, so either blue or violet.

So which one is correct? Let me think about the colors. Violet is higher energy than blue. So the absorption would be in the violet range if the energy is higher than 2.3393 eV.

Wait, wait, let's calculate the energy for violet (around 400 nm). E = 1240 / 400 ≈ 3.1 eV. Which is higher than 2.3393 eV. Blue is around 450 nm: E=1240/450≈2.755 eV. So 2.755 eV is higher than 2.3393 eV.

So the absorbed photon could be either blue or violet. But according to the options, both are present.

Wait, but the question's options are A) Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow.

So what color has higher energy than 2.3393 eV? Both blue (2.75 eV) and violet (3.1 eV) are higher. So how do I determine which one is the correct answer?

Wait, maybe I should look at the energy difference between absorption and emission. If the emission is 2.3393 eV, the absorption must be higher. So the question is, which of the options (violet or blue) has higher energy than 2.3393 eV.

Wait, 2.3393 eV is approximately 2.34 eV. Blue is around 2.755 eV, which is higher. Violet is 3.1 eV, which is higher. So both are higher than 2.34 eV.

Hmm, that suggests both B and C are possible, but the options don't have both correct. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I should think about the common colors absorbed in dyes. Extensively conjugated dyes often absorb in the visible range, but if they have strong conjugation, they can absorb in the lower energy (longer wavelength) part of the spectrum. Wait, but if the emission is 2.3393 eV (530 nm), which is green, then the absorption must be higher energy (lower wavelength). So the absorbed photon is either blue or violet.

Wait, but what if the emitted light is in the green, which would be in the middle of the visible spectrum. The absorbed light would be either blue or violet, with higher energy.

But without more information, it's hard to pick between B and C. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the complementary color. Wait, the color that the compound absorbs is the color it doesn't reflect. So if the compound emits green, does that mean it absorbs blue or violet? Hmm, not necessarily. The emission color is the color of the light it gives off, which is different from the color it absorbs.

Wait, no, the color we see is due to the wavelengths that are reflected or transmitted. If a compound absorbs certain wavelengths and emits others, it can appear with a different color. But that's more about the color we perceive, not the absorption.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the energy transitions. The energy of the absorbed photon would be higher than the emitted one. So the absorbed photon's energy is higher than 2.3393 eV. So, the color of the absorbed photon is either blue or violet.

But the options are B and C. Which one is it?

Wait, another approach: the energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV. Let's compute the exact wavelength.

E = hc/λ → λ = hc/E

h = 6.626e-34 Js

c = 3e8 m/s

E = 2.3393 eV = 2.3393 * 1.602e-19 J ≈ 3.745e-19 J.

So λ = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (3.745e-19) → calculate numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25.

Divide by 3.745e-19 → 1.9878e-25 / 3.745e-19 ≈ 5.31e-7 meters, which is 531 nm.

So 531 nm is in the green range (since green is around 495-570 nm). So emitted light is green.

The absorbed light has higher energy, so shorter wavelength. So the absorbed photon is either blue (about 450-495 nm, ~2.5-2.75 eV) or violet (380-450 nm, 2.75-3.1 eV).

Wait, but 2.3393 eV is lower than both blue and violet.

So the absorbed photon would be in the blue or violet range. So options B or C.

But the question is which one.

Wait, perhaps the energy gap for conjugated systems is such that the absorption is in the blue region. Hmm, I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy of the emitted photon is in the green, so the absorbed photon must be in the blue. Or perhaps the opposite.

Wait, another approach: the energy of the photon emitted (2.3393 eV) equals the energy of the absorbed photon minus the energy lost during the process. So E_abs = E_emit + E_loss.

Assuming some energy is lost as heat or other transitions, E_abs is larger than E_emit.

But without knowing E_loss, it's hard to say. But perhaps the energy difference between absorption and emission is small enough that the absorption is in the blue.

Wait, but for a conjugated molecule, the absorption is typically in the visible range. For example, many dyes like beta-carotene absorb in the blue/violet and emit in the orange/red.

Wait, but in this case, the emission is green, which is quite a high energy for emission, suggesting that the absorption is even higher.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B) Violet, because 2.3393 eV is green emission, so the absorbed photon is higher, violet.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about specific examples. For example, if a molecule absorbs at 400 nm (violet), and emits at 530 nm (green), that would fit. Alternatively, if it absorbs at 450 nm (blue), emits at 530 nm, that's also possible.

But how do I decide between these two options? Since both are possible, but the question gives both as options.

Wait, another thought: the energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than the emitted photon. So the energy of the absorbed photon should be higher than 2.3393 eV.

Given that violet light is higher in energy than blue, the absorbed photon must be violet if it's higher, but if the absorbed photon's energy is just a little higher, maybe it's blue.

But without more data, perhaps the correct approach is to go with the calculation.

Wait, the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV (531 nm) which is green. The absorbed photon has higher energy (lower wavelength). So the color absorbed must be either blue or violet.

Looking back at the options, B is violet and C is blue. So which one is it?

Wait, perhaps in the context of conjugated systems, the absorption is in the blue region. Because when a molecule has a conjugated system, the absorption maximum is often in the visible range, say blue or green. Wait, but in this case, the emission is in green, so the absorption must be higher.

Wait, perhaps I should use the concept of complementary colors. The color that a substance appears is the color it reflects, which is the complement of the absorbed color. But wait, the emitted light is green. So the substance emits green, which would mean it's reflecting or emitting green. But in terms of absorption, it would have absorbed a higher energy photon.

But I'm not sure how that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the color that's absorbed, which is the color that's not emitted. But I don't think that's correct.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the energy levels. The molecule absorbs a photon, gets excited to a higher energy state. Then, it emits a photon when it drops to a lower energy state, but not necessarily the ground state. So the emitted photon's energy is the difference between the excited state and the lower state. The absorbed photon's energy is the difference between the ground state and the excited state.

So E_abs = E_excited - E_ground

E_emit = E_excited - E_emitted_state

So E_abs = E_emit + E_emitted_state - E_ground

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe E_abs = E_emit + E_other, where E_other is the energy difference between E_emitted_state and E_ground.

So E_abs could be larger than E_emit by any amount, but in reality, E_other is usually small compared to E_emit.

But without knowing the exact energy levels, perhaps I should make an assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B) Violet, because the energy of 2.3393 eV is green emission, so the absorbed photon is higher energy, violet.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the emitted photon is at 2.34 eV (531 nm, green), which implies that the absorption is in the blue or violet.

Wait, another thought: the energy of the photon emitted is 2.3393 eV, which is green. If the molecule emits green, the absorbed photon is the one that initially excited it to a higher state. So the absorbed photon's energy is higher than the emitted.

So the absorbed photon's energy must be in the range of higher than 2.3393 eV, which is about 531 nm. So the color would be either blue (450 nm, 2.755 eV) or violet (400 nm, 3.1 eV).

So which one is correct? Without more info, perhaps I should pick the one that is in the higher energy.

Wait, wait. Let me think about typical dye absorption. Many dyes absorb in the blue or violet regions and emit in the yellow or red regions. For example, a dye that absorbs blue and emits red is called a red emitter. But in this case, the emission is green, so perhaps the absorption is blue or violet.

But without knowing, perhaps the correct way is to choose the option with higher energy than the emitted. Since both B and C are higher, but the question only provides options, perhaps I need to choose based on the calculated E.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the exact energy for each option.

Option B: Violet. Let's say 400 nm (E=3.1 eV).

Option C: Blue, 450 nm (E=2.755 eV).

So the emission energy is 2.3393 eV. The absorbed photon must have higher energy than that. So both B and C are higher, but which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B) Violet. Because 2.3393 eV is green emission, which is lower than violet's 3.1 eV.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C) Blue, because 2.755 eV is higher than 2.3393 eV.

But the options don't include both, so I have to choose between them.

Wait, another angle: the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. The energy of the absorbed photon is higher. So the absorbed photon must be in the blue or violet.

Given that, the absorbed color is either blue or violet. But the question is, which one is it?

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the energy difference between absorption and emission is small. So if the emission is 2.34 eV, the absorption would be a bit higher, so maybe 2.75 eV (blue). But if it's a large conjugated system, the energy gap may be smaller, so the absorption might be in a longer wavelength (lower energy) than that.

Wait, but that's conflicting with previous reasoning. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the emission corresponds to the energy difference between two states, which are both in the excited state. So the absorption could be higher.

But I'm going in circles here. Let me try to make a decision based on the options.

The possible colors are violet and blue. Both have energy higher than 2.3393 eV. So the correct answer must be either B or C.

Wait, another approach: the energy of light emitted is 2.3393 eV. The energy of the absorbed photon must be higher.

So, if the emitted photon is green (530 nm), what color is absorbed?

If the molecule emits green, it must have absorbed a higher energy photon. So the absorbed photon is either blue or violet.

But how to choose between these two?

Wait, perhaps the absorbed photon is in the blue region. Because the emission is green, which is lower in energy than blue.

Wait, but blue is higher in energy than green. So the absorption is in the blue region. So the correct answer would be C) Blue.

Wait, but I'm getting myself confused. Let me think about the positions on the spectrum.

The order of energy from highest to lowest: violet (380), blue (450), green (530), yellow (580), orange (620), red (700).

So, the emitted photon is green (530 nm, 2.34 eV). The absorbed photon must be either violet (380-450 nm, 2.75-3.1 eV) or blue (450-495 nm, 2.4-2.75 eV).

Wait, wait a second. Blue is 450-495 nm, which corresponds to E= 1240/450 ≈ 2.755 eV down to 1240/495≈2.505 eV.

So blue photons have energies from about 2.505 eV to 2.755 eV.

The emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, which is less than 2.505 eV. So blue photons are higher in energy than the emitted photon.

So the absorbed photon's energy is in the blue range (2.5-2.75 eV). So the absorbed color is blue.

Wait, but wait. 2.3393 eV is lower than 2.5 eV. So yes, the absorbed photon would be in the blue region (2.5-2.75 eV).

Wait, but 2.3393 is less than 2.5, so the absorbed must be in a higher energy (shorter wavelength) than the emitted.

So the absorption would be in the blue or violet.

But since blue photons are 2.5-2.75 eV, which are higher than 2.3393 eV, the absorbed photon would be blue.

So the correct answer would be C) Blue.

Wait, but another thought: if the emitted photon is green (530 nm), then the absorbed photon must be blue (450 nm), which is higher in energy. So the answer is C) Blue.

Alternatively, if the absorption is violet (400 nm), which is higher energy than blue, but 2.3393 eV is in the green.

But in that case, the emitted photon is green, and the absorbed is violet. So the correct answer would be B) Violet.

Hmm, but without more information, I'm not sure. But based on the calculation, the absorbed photon's energy must be higher than 2.3393 eV. So the color is either blue or violet.

But which one? Let me think about a real example. For instance, when a fluorescent dye absorbs UV light and emits visible light. For example, fluorescein absorbs around 480 nm (blue) and emits green around 520 nm. So in that case, the emitted is green, the absorbed is blue.

So in such a case, the absorbed photon is blue, and the emitted is green.

So perhaps the correct answer is C) Blue.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we analyze the relationship between the energy of the emitted photon and the absorbed photon. The energy of the emitted photon is given as **2.3393 eV**, which corresponds to a wavelength of approximately **530 nm** (calculated using the formula \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \)). This places the emitted light in the **green** region of the visible spectrum.

The energy of the absorbed photon must be **higher** than the energy of the emitted photon because the absorbed photon excites the molecule to a higher energy state, and the emitted photon corresponds to the energy difference between two excited states or the transition to a lower energy state. Since the absorbed photon has higher energy, its wavelength is shorter than 530 nm, placing it in the **blue or violet** regions of the spectrum.

To differentiate between blue and violet:
- Blue light corresponds to wavelengths in the range **450–495 nm**, with energies approximately **2.4–2.75 eV**.
- Violet light corresponds to wavelengths in the range **380–450 nm**, with energies approximately **2.75–3.1 eV**.

Since the emitted photon has an energy of **2.3393 eV**, the absorbed photon must have an energy higher than this. Both blue and violet satisfy this condition, but the question provides only these two options. Based on typical dye behavior, where absorption often occurs in the blue region for compounds emitting green light, the most likely absorbed color is **blue**.

Thus, the compound absorbs light in the **blue** region of the spectrum.

Answer: C

Okay, so I have this question about organic chemistry, specifically about dyes and the light they emit. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step.

The question says that a textile dye with an extensively conjugated pi-electron system emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV. I need to find out which color of light is absorbed by the compound. The options are Red, Violet, Blue, Yellow.

Wait, I remember something about the energy of light and its wavelength being related. Oh right, the energy of a photon is inversely proportional to its wavelength. The formula is E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength. 

So the energy given is 2.3393 eV. I think I should convert that into wavelength to find out the color. Because each color corresponds to a specific wavelength range. For example, red is around 650-700 nm, violet is 380-450 nm, blue is 450-495 nm, and yellow is 570-590 nm or something like that.

Wait, but wait a second. The question says the dye emits light at that energy. Oh, right, when a molecule absorbs light, it gets excited, and then it emits light when it goes back down. So the emitted light's energy corresponds to the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state. But wait, the emitted light's energy is what we're given. Oh, so the energy emitted is the energy difference. But wait, no, wait. The energy of the emitted photon is equal to the energy gap between the two states. So if the molecule emits a photon of energy E, that's the energy that was released when it relaxed. But what about absorption? The molecule absorbs a photon of higher energy than that, right? Because it needs to get excited to a higher energy state.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the electromagnetic spectrum. Visible light is from about 380 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). The energy of the photon is inversely proportional to wavelength. So higher energy corresponds to shorter wavelength.

So if the emitted light is 2.3393 eV, that would correspond to a certain wavelength. Let me calculate that. How do I convert eV to wavelength?

The formula is E (eV) = 1240 / λ (nm). So λ = 1240 / E.

Plugging in E=2.3393 eV:

λ = 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ let me calculate that.

1240 divided by 2.3393. Hmm, 2.3393 is approximately 2.34. So 1240 / 2.34 ≈ 529.9 nm. So about 530 nm.

What color is 530 nm? Let me think. The visible spectrum:

- Violet: ~380-450 nm
- Blue: ~450-495 nm
- Green: ~495-570 nm
- Yellow: ~570-590 nm
- Orange: ~590-620 nm
- Red: ~620-700 nm

Wait, so 530 is in the green region. Wait, but wait, the question is about the color absorbed. So if the compound emits light at 530 nm, which is green, then what color did it absorb?

Wait, no. I'm getting confused. Let me rethink. When a dye absorbs light, it's because the energy of the photon matches the energy gap between the molecule's states. So the absorbed photon's energy corresponds to the energy difference. Then, when it relaxes, it emits a photon of lower energy (since some energy is lost, maybe as heat or maybe because it doesn't transition all the way back?).

Wait, no, that's not quite right. The energy of the emitted photon plus the energy of any photon emitted during other transitions (like in fluorescence) might add up to the absorbed photon's energy. But wait, for simplicity, maybe the energy of the emitted photon is in the same range as the absorbed photon? Or perhaps it's a different energy because the molecule might have multiple excited states.

Wait, maybe I should think about this in terms of the absorption and emission spectrum.

In fluorescence, the molecule absorbs a photon of higher energy (higher frequency, shorter wavelength) and emits a photon of lower energy (longer wavelength). So the emitted photon has lower energy than the absorbed one.

So if the compound emits at 2.3393 eV, then the absorbed photon must have higher energy (lower wavelength) than that.

Wait, but wait, let me clarify. The absorption happens when the molecule goes from a lower energy state (ground state) to a higher energy state (excited state). The energy of the photon absorbed is E_abs = E_excited - E_ground.

Then, when the molecule relaxes, it emits a photon. The emitted photon's energy is E_emit = E_excited - E_emitted_state, which could be a lower energy state than the ground state, but in many cases, it's just a lower excited state.

But for the purpose of this question, perhaps the emission is due to fluorescence, which is when the molecule goes from a higher excited state to a lower one, emitting a photon. So in that case, the energy of the emitted photon is E_emit = E_high_excited - E_low_excited.

But the absorption would have been for E_abs = E_high_excited - E_ground. So E_abs is larger than E_emit.

Wait, so if the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, the absorbed photon must be higher than that. So the absorbed photon has higher energy than 2.3393 eV. Therefore, the wavelength of the absorbed photon is shorter than that of the emitted photon.

So the emitted photon's wavelength is 530 nm (green), so the absorbed photon would be shorter than that. Let's calculate the wavelength for the absorbed photon.

Wait, but wait, how much higher is E_abs than E_emit? Well, depending on the exact states, but maybe for this problem, it's sufficient to know that the emitted photon is lower in energy than the absorbed.

So, the emitted photon is green (530 nm is green), so the absorbed photon must be higher in energy (lower wavelength) than green. So that would be blue (around 450-495 nm), violet (380-450), perhaps.

Wait, wait. Let me think about colors. The colors of absorbed light are the ones not transmitted or reflected. So the dye would appear the color that's complementary to the absorbed color. For example, if it absorbs blue, it would reflect the complementary color, which is orange. Wait, but that's about color appearance, not the absorbed photon's color.

Wait, no. The question is directly asking what color of light is absorbed. So if the emitted light is green, the absorbed light must be higher energy (shorter wavelength) than green. So it would be blue or violet.

But let me calculate what wavelength corresponds to 2.3393 eV for the emission. So 530 nm is green. So the absorbed photon must have higher energy, which is lower wavelength. So the absorbed color would be in the blue or violet range.

Wait, but if the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, let's see what other colors correspond to that energy.

Wait, no. The emission is 2.3393 eV. So the absorption is higher energy. So the absorption would be in the UV or blue/violet range.

Wait, the options are A) Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow.

So the absorbed photon must have higher energy than 2.3393 eV. So the wavelength would be shorter than 530 nm. So that would be in the blue or violet range.

So the possible options are B and C.

But which one?

Wait, let's calculate the energy of light in the violet and blue regions.

Violet is about 380-450 nm. Let's take 400 nm as an example. E = 1240 / 400 ≈ 3.1 eV.

Blue is around 450-495 nm. Let's say 450 nm. E=1240/450≈2.755 eV.

So the emitted photon is at 2.3393 eV, which is 530 nm (green). The absorbed photon must be higher than 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed photon's energy must be higher than 2.3393 eV.

So if the absorbed photon is, say, 3.1 eV (violet, 400 nm), that's higher than 2.3393. Alternatively, if it's 2.755 eV (blue, 450 nm), that's also higher.

But the options are B and C: Violet and Blue.

So which one is the correct one?

Wait, the question states that the compound has an extensively conjugated pi-electron system. Extensive conjugation usually leads to lower energy gaps (because longer conjugation delocalizes electrons more, lowers the energy gap). So the energy required for absorption would be lower? Or wait, no. Wait, no, longer conjugation leads to lower energy gaps, so the absorption would be at a longer wavelength (lower energy). Wait, no, wait.

Wait, conjugation increases the extent of delocalization, which lowers the energy gap between HOMO and LUMO. So lower energy is required for excitation. So the absorption maximum shifts to longer wavelengths (lower energy) as conjugation increases. So more conjugation → redshift (bathochromic shift).

So if the molecule has extensive conjugation, the absorbed photon would be of lower energy than a less conjugated molecule. Wait, but in this case, the emission is 2.3393 eV, which is lower than the absorption energy.

Ah, wait. No, the absorption energy is higher than the emission energy. So the emission energy is 2.3393 eV. The absorption energy must be higher than that. So if the molecule has more conjugation, the absorption maximum would be at longer wavelengths (lower energy). But higher energy would be shorter wavelengths. Wait, this is getting a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the energy difference. The energy difference between the ground and excited state (absorption) is higher than the energy difference between the excited and another state (emission). So E_abs = E_emit + something (maybe the energy lost in the process, like in fluorescence efficiency).

But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, if the molecule emits at a lower energy than it absorbed, then the absorbed photon must have higher energy. So the absorbed photon is higher in energy than the emitted one. Given that, the absorption is in a higher energy (lower wavelength) than the emission.

So emitted is 2.3393 eV (green, 530 nm). The absorption must be higher than that, so either blue or violet.

So which one is correct? Let me think about the colors. Violet is higher energy than blue. So the absorption would be in the violet range if the energy is higher than 2.3393 eV.

Wait, wait, let's calculate the energy for violet (around 400 nm). E = 1240 / 400 ≈ 3.1 eV. Which is higher than 2.3393 eV. Blue is around 450 nm: E=1240/450≈2.755 eV. So 2.755 eV is higher than 2.3393 eV.

So the absorbed photon could be either blue or violet. But according to the options, both are present.

Wait, but the question's options are A) Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow.

So what color has higher energy than 2.3393 eV? Both blue (2.75 eV) and violet (3.1 eV) are higher. So how do I determine which one is the correct answer?

Wait, maybe I should look at the energy difference between absorption and emission. If the emission is 2.3393 eV, the absorption must be higher. So the question is, which of the options (violet or blue) has higher energy than 2.3393 eV.

Wait, 2.3393 eV is approximately 2.34 eV. Blue is around 2.755 eV, which is higher. Violet is 3.1 eV, which is higher. So both are higher than 2.34 eV.

Hmm, that suggests both B and C are possible, but the options don't have both correct. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I should think about the common colors absorbed in dyes. Extensively conjugated dyes often absorb in the visible range, but if they have strong conjugation, they can absorb in the lower energy (longer wavelength) part of the spectrum. Wait, but if the emission is 2.3393 eV (530 nm), which is green, then the absorption must be higher energy (lower wavelength). So the absorbed photon is either blue or violet.

Wait, but what if the emitted light is in the green, which would be in the middle of the visible spectrum. The absorbed light would be either blue or violet, with higher energy.

But without more information, it's hard to pick between B and C. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the complementary color. Wait, the color that the compound absorbs is the color it doesn't reflect. So if the compound emits green, does that mean it absorbs blue or violet? Hmm, not necessarily. The emission color is the color of the light it gives off, which is different from the color it absorbs.

Wait, no, the color we see is due to the wavelengths that are reflected or transmitted. If a compound absorbs certain wavelengths and emits others, it can appear with a different color. But that's more about the color we perceive, not the absorption.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the energy transitions. The energy of the absorbed photon would be higher than the emitted one. So the absorbed photon's energy is higher than 2.3393 eV. So, the color of the absorbed photon is either blue or violet.

But the options are B and C. Which one is it?

Wait, another approach: the energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV. Let's compute the exact wavelength.

E = hc/λ → λ = hc/E

h = 6.626e-34 Js

c = 3e8 m/s

E = 2.3393 eV = 2.3393 * 1.602e-19 J ≈ 3.745e-19 J.

So λ = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (3.745e-19) → calculate numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25.

Divide by 3.745e-19 → 1.9878e-25 / 3.745e-19 ≈ 5.31e-7 meters, which is 531 nm.

So 531 nm is in the green range (since green is around 495-570 nm). So emitted light is green.

The absorbed light has higher energy, so shorter wavelength. So the absorbed photon is either blue (about 450-495 nm, ~2.5-2.75 eV) or violet (380-450 nm, 2.75-3.1 eV).

Wait, but 2.3393 eV is lower than both blue and violet.

So the absorbed photon would be in the blue or violet range. So options B or C.

But the question is which one.

Wait, perhaps the energy gap for conjugated systems is such that the absorption is in the blue region. Hmm, I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy of the emitted photon is in the green, so the absorbed photon must be in the blue. Or perhaps the opposite.

Wait, another approach: the energy of the photon emitted (2.3393 eV) equals the energy of the absorbed photon minus the energy lost during the process. So E_abs = E_emit + E_loss.

Assuming some energy is lost as heat or other transitions, E_abs is larger than E_emit.

But without knowing E_loss, it's hard to say. But perhaps the energy difference between absorption and emission is small enough that the absorption is in the blue.

Wait, but for a conjugated molecule, the absorption is typically in the visible range. For example, many dyes like beta-carotene absorb in the blue/violet and emit in the orange/red.

Wait, but in this case, the emission is green, which is quite a high energy for emission, suggesting that the absorption is even higher.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B) Violet, because 2.3393 eV is green emission, so the absorbed photon is higher, violet.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about specific examples. For example, if a molecule absorbs at 400 nm (violet), and emits at 530 nm (green), that would fit. Alternatively, if it absorbs at 450 nm (blue), emits at 530 nm, that's also possible.

But how do I decide between these two options? Since both are possible, but the question gives both as options.

Wait, another thought: the energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than the emitted photon. So the energy of the absorbed photon should be higher than 2.3393 eV.

Given that violet light is higher in energy than blue, the absorbed photon must be violet if it's higher, but if the absorbed photon's energy is just a little higher, maybe it's blue.

But without more data, perhaps the correct approach is to go with the calculation.

Wait, the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV (531 nm) which is green. The absorbed photon has higher energy (lower wavelength). So the color absorbed must be either blue or violet.

Looking back at the options, B is violet and C is blue. So which one is it?

Wait, perhaps in the context of conjugated systems, the absorption is in the blue region. Because when a molecule has a conjugated system, the absorption maximum is often in the visible range, say blue or green. Wait, but in this case, the emission is in green, so the absorption must be higher.

Wait, perhaps I should use the concept of complementary colors. The color that a substance appears is the color it reflects, which is the complement of the absorbed color. But wait, the emitted light is green. So the substance emits green, which would mean it's reflecting or emitting green. But in terms of absorption, it would have absorbed a higher energy photon.

But I'm not sure how that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the color that's absorbed, which is the color that's not emitted. But I don't think that's correct.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the energy levels. The molecule absorbs a photon, gets excited to a higher energy state. Then, it emits a photon when it drops to a lower energy state, but not necessarily the ground state. So the emitted photon's energy is the difference between the excited state and the lower state. The absorbed photon's energy is the difference between the ground state and the excited state.

So E_abs = E_excited - E_ground

E_emit = E_excited - E_emitted_state

So E_abs = E_emit + E_emitted_state - E_ground

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe E_abs = E_emit + E_other, where E_other is the energy difference between E_emitted_state and E_ground.

So E_abs could be larger than E_emit by any amount, but in reality, E_other is usually small compared to E_emit.

But without knowing the exact energy levels, perhaps I should make an assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B) Violet, because the energy of 2.3393 eV is green emission, so the absorbed photon is higher energy, violet.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the emitted photon is at 2.34 eV (531 nm, green), which implies that the absorption is in the blue or violet.

Wait, another thought: the energy of the photon emitted is 2.3393 eV, which is green. If the molecule emits green, the absorbed photon is the one that initially excited it to a higher state. So the absorbed photon's energy is higher than the emitted.

So the absorbed photon's energy must be in the range of higher than 2.3393 eV, which is about 531 nm. So the color would be either blue (450 nm, 2.755 eV) or violet (400 nm, 3.1 eV).

So which one is correct? Without more info, perhaps I should pick the one that is in the higher energy.

Wait, wait. Let me think about typical dye absorption. Many dyes absorb in the blue or violet regions and emit in the yellow or red regions. For example, a dye that absorbs blue and emits red is called a red emitter. But in this case, the emission is green, so perhaps the absorption is blue or violet.

But without knowing, perhaps the correct way is to choose the option with higher energy than the emitted. Since both B and C are higher, but the question only provides options, perhaps I need to choose based on the calculated E.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the exact energy for each option.

Option B: Violet. Let's say 400 nm (E=3.1 eV).

Option C: Blue, 450 nm (E=2.755 eV).

So the emission energy is 2.3393 eV. The absorbed photon must have higher energy than that. So both B and C are higher, but which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B) Violet. Because 2.3393 eV is green emission, which is lower than violet's 3.1 eV.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C) Blue, because 2.755 eV is higher than 2.3393 eV.

But the options don't include both, so I have to choose between them.

Wait, another angle: the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. The energy of the absorbed photon is higher. So the absorbed photon must be in the blue or violet.

Given that, the absorbed color is either blue or violet. But the question is, which one is it?

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the energy difference between absorption and emission is small. So if the emission is 2.34 eV, the absorption would be a bit higher, so maybe 2.75 eV (blue). But if it's a large conjugated system, the energy gap may be smaller, so the absorption might be in a longer wavelength (lower energy) than that.

Wait, but that's conflicting with previous reasoning. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the emission corresponds to the energy difference between two states, which are both in the excited state. So the absorption could be higher.

But I'm going in circles here. Let me try to make a decision based on the options.

The possible colors are violet and blue. Both have energy higher than 2.3393 eV. So the correct answer must be either B or C.

Wait, another approach: the energy of light emitted is 2.3393 eV. The energy of the absorbed photon must be higher.

So, if the emitted photon is green (530 nm), what color is absorbed?

If the molecule emits green, it must have absorbed a higher energy photon. So the absorbed photon is either blue or violet.

But how to choose between these two?

Wait, perhaps the absorbed photon is in the blue region. Because the emission is green, which is lower in energy than blue.

Wait, but blue is higher in energy than green. So the absorption is in the blue region. So the correct answer would be C) Blue.

Wait, but I'm getting myself confused. Let me think about the positions on the spectrum.

The order of energy from highest to lowest: violet (380), blue (450), green (530), yellow (580), orange (620), red (700).

So, the emitted photon is green (530 nm, 2.34 eV). The absorbed photon must be either violet (380-450 nm, 2.75-3.1 eV) or blue (450-495 nm, 2.4-2.75 eV).

Wait, wait a second. Blue is 450-495 nm, which corresponds to E= 1240/450 ≈ 2.755 eV down to 1240/495≈2.505 eV.

So blue photons have energies from about 2.505 eV to 2.755 eV.

The emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, which is less than 2.505 eV. So blue photons are higher in energy than the emitted photon.

So the absorbed photon's energy is in the blue range (2.5-2.75 eV). So the absorbed color is blue.

Wait, but wait. 2.3393 eV is lower than 2.5 eV. So yes, the absorbed photon would be in the blue region (2.5-2.75 eV).

Wait, but 2.3393 is less than 2.5, so the absorbed must be in a higher energy (shorter wavelength) than the emitted.

So the absorption would be in the blue or violet.

But since blue photons are 2.5-2.75 eV, which are higher than 2.3393 eV, the absorbed photon would be blue.

So the correct answer would be C) Blue.

Wait, but another thought: if the emitted photon is green (530 nm), then the absorbed photon must be blue (450 nm), which is higher in energy. So the answer is C) Blue.

Alternatively, if the absorption is violet (400 nm), which is higher energy than blue, but 2.3393 eV is in the green.

But in that case, the emitted photon is green, and the absorbed is violet. So the correct answer would be B) Violet.

Hmm, but without more information, I'm not sure. But based on the calculation, the absorbed photon's energy must be higher than 2.3393 eV. So the color is either blue or violet.

But which one? Let me think about a real example. For instance, when a fluorescent dye absorbs UV light and emits visible light. For example, fluorescein absorbs around 480 nm (blue) and emits green around 520 nm. So in that case, the emitted is green, the absorbed is blue.

So in such a case, the absorbed photon is blue, and the emitted is green.

So perhaps the correct answer is C) Blue.


To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we analyze the relationship between the energy of the emitted photon and the absorbed photon. The energy of the emitted photon is given as **2.3393 eV**, which corresponds to a wavelength of approximately **530 nm** (calculated using the formula \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \)). This places the emitted light in the **green** region of the visible spectrum.

The energy of the absorbed photon must be **higher** than the energy of the emitted photon because the absorbed photon excites the molecule to a higher energy state, and the emitted photon corresponds to the energy difference between two excited states or the transition to a lower energy state. Since the absorbed photon has higher energy, its wavelength is shorter than 530 nm, placing it in the **blue or violet** regions of the spectrum.

To differentiate between blue and violet:
- Blue light corresponds to wavelengths in the range **450–495 nm**, with energies approximately **2.4–2.75 eV**.
- Violet light corresponds to wavelengths in the range **380–450 nm**, with energies approximately **2.75–3.1 eV**.

Since the emitted photon has an energy of **2.3393 eV**, the absorbed photon must have an energy higher than this. Both blue and violet satisfy this condition, but the question provides only these two options. Based on typical dye behavior, where absorption often occurs in the blue region for compounds emitting green light, the most likely absorbed color is **blue**.

Thus, the compound absorbs light in the **blue** region of the spectrum.

Answer: C
