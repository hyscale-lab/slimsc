Okay, so I've got this physics problem about pions decaying into a muon and a neutrino. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me try to think this through.

The question states that a Pi(+) is at rest and decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV/c² and the muon is 105.7 MeV/c². Wait, the neutrino has such a tiny mass, I think it's considered massless in these kinds of problems. So its rest mass is effectively zero.

I remember that in such decay processes, energy and momentum are conserved. Since the pion is initially at rest, the total momentum of the products should be zero. So the muon and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. That makes sense because p is conserved.

But wait, the problem is asking for the kinetic energy of the product particles. Oh right, so each of them will have some kinetic energy, and the sum of their energies should add up to the available energy from the pion decay.

The available energy comes from the rest mass of the pion. When the pion decays, its rest mass energy (139.6 MeV) is converted into the rest masses of the muon and the neutrino, plus their kinetic energies.

So let's think about energy conservation. The total energy after decay should be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

The pion's energy is just its rest mass because it's stationary. So total energy is 139.6 MeV.

The muon's energy will be its rest mass plus its kinetic energy, E_mu = m_mu c² + K_mu. The neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy, since it's massless, E_nu = K_nu.

So putting it together:
139.6 = (105.7 + K_mu) + K_nu.

Also, from momentum conservation, since the pion is at rest, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So |p_mu| = |p_nu|.

The energy of each particle is related to their momentum and mass. For the muon: E_mu² = (p_mu c)² + (m_mu c²)². For the neutrino: E_nu² = (p_nu c)², since m_nu is zero.

Since p_mu = p_nu, let's call this shared momentum 'p'. So,

E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 )
E_nu = p c

Now, the total energy equation becomes:
139.6 = (105.7 + K_mu) + K_nu
But K_mu = E_mu - 105.7, and K_nu = E_nu.

So substituting,
139.6 = [sqrt( (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) - 105.7 ] + [p c ]

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. Let me rearrange it.

Let me denote E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2 ), so:

139.6 = (E_mu - 105.7) + (p c )

But E_mu is sqrt( (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2 ). Let me substitute that in.

139.6 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) - 105.7 + p c

Let me combine the terms:

sqrt( (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p c = 139.6 + 105.7 = 245.3

Hmm, so sqrt( (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p c = 245.3 MeV.

That's one equation with one unknown, p c. Let me let x = p c. So the equation becomes:

sqrt( x² + 105.7² ) + x = 245.3

I can rewrite this as sqrt(x² + 105.7² ) = 245.3 - x

Now square both sides to eliminate the square root:

x² + (105.7)^2 = (245.3 - x)^2

Expanding the right side:
= (245.3)^2 - 2*245.3 x + x²

So:
x² + (105.7)^2 = (245.3)^2 - 2*245.3 x + x²

Subtract x² from both sides:

(105.7)^2 = (245.3)^2 - 2*245.3 x

Now plug in the numbers.

Compute (105.7)^2: 105.7 * 105.7. Let me approximate. 100^2 is 10,000, 5.7^2 is around 32.49, and cross terms: 2*100*5.7=1140. So 10,000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11,172.49. So about 11,172.5 MeV².

(245.3)^2: Let's see, 245^2 is 60,025. 0.3^2 is 0.09. Then 2*245*0.3 = 147. So (245 + 0.3)^2 = 245^2 + 2*245*0.3 + 0.3^2 = 60,025 + 147 + 0.09 = 60,172.09 MeV².

So now:

11,172.5 = 60,172.09 - (2*245.3)x

Rearranging:

2*245.3 x = 60,172.09 - 11,172.5

Compute 60,172 - 11,172.5 = 49,000 approximately? Wait: 60,172.09 minus 11,172.5 is 49,000 - 0.41? Let me calculate:

60,172.09 - 11,172.5 = 49,000 - (11,172.5 - 11,172.09) = 49,000 - 0.41 = 48,999.59?

Wait, that can’t be right. Wait, 60,172.09 minus 11,172.5 is:

60,172.09
-11,172.50
=49,000. (Wait, 60,172.09 minus 11,172.5 is 49,000 approximately. Let me compute it more accurately.

60,172.09 - 11,172.5:

60,172.09
-11,172.50
=49,000 - 0.41 = 48,999.59 MeV².

So, 2*245.3 x = 48,999.59

Wait, 2*245.3 is 490.6.

So,

490.6 x = 48,999.59

x = 48,999.59 / 490.6 ≈ Let me compute that.

Divide numerator and denominator by 1000: 48.99959 / 0.4906 ≈ 48.9996 / 0.4906 ≈ Let me compute 49 / 0.4906 ≈ approximately 99.88.

Wait, 0.4906 * 100 is 49.06, so 0.4906 * 99.88 is about 49.06 * 100 = 4906, but wait I'm getting confused.

Wait, 490.6 is the denominator. 48,999.59 / 490.6 ≈ 48,999.59 / 490.6 ≈ Let's compute 490.6 * 100 = 49,060. So 48,999.59 is a bit less than 49,060. So 99.88 maybe. Wait, 490.6 * 99 = 490.6*(100-1)=49060 -490.6=48569.4. Hmm, so 490.6 * 99 = 48569.4.

But we have 48,999.59, which is 48,999.59 - 48,569.4 = 430.19 left.

So 430.19 /490.6 ≈ 0.876.

So x ≈ 99.876 MeV/c.

So p c ≈ 99.876 MeV/c.

Wait, but let me just take the approximate value as 99.88 MeV/c.

Now, E_nu = p c = 99.88 MeV.

E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) = sqrt( (99.88)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Compute 99.88^2: let's see, 100^2 is 10,000, 99.88 is 0.12 less. So (100 - 0.12)^2 = 100^2 - 2*100*0.12 + 0.12^2 = 10,000 -24 + 0.0144 ≈ 9976.0144.

105.7^2 is 11,172.49, as calculated before.

So (99.88)^2 + (105.7)^2 ≈ 9,976.01 + 11,172.49 = 21,148.5.

The square root of 21,148.5 is approximately 145.42 MeV.

So E_mu is about 145.42 MeV.

So K_mu = E_mu - m_mu c² = 145.42 - 105.7 = 39.72 MeV.

Wait, but wait. The neutrino's energy is 99.88 MeV. So the kinetic energies are 39.72 MeV for the muon and 99.88 MeV for the neutrino.

But wait, looking at the options, the KEs are lower. Hmm. Hmm, but wait, let me check the calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think again.

Wait, in the energy equation, I have:

Total energy after decay is 139.6 MeV. So,

E_mu + E_nu = 139.6.

But E_mu is sqrt( p^2 c^4 + m_mu^2 c^4 ) / c^2 ?

Wait, maybe I messed up the units. Let me clarify.

Wait, actually, the energy is in MeV. The equation is E_mu + E_nu = 139.6.

But E_mu is the total energy of the muon, which is m_mu c² (rest energy) plus K_mu (kinetic energy). So E_mu = m_mu c² + K_mu. Similarly, E_nu is the total energy of the neutrino, which is K_nu, since its rest mass is negligible.

So, the energy conservation equation is:

m_pi c² = (m_mu c² + K_mu) + K_nu

Which simplifies to:

K_mu + K_nu = m_pi c² - m_mu c² = (139.6 - 105.7) MeV = 33.9 MeV.

So K_mu + K_nu = 33.9 MeV.

But then, from momentum conservation, since the pion is at rest, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta.

So, p_mu = p_nu in magnitude but opposite in direction.

Expressing in terms of energy-momentum:

For the muon:

E_mu² = (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2

For the neutrino:

E_nu² = (p_nu c)^2

But p_mu = -p_nu, so their magnitudes are equal. So,

p_mu c = sqrt( E_nu^2 - (m_nu c²)^2 )

Wait, but m_nu is 0, so p_mu c = E_nu.

So, p_mu c = E_nu.

Substituting into the muon's equation:

E_mu² = (E_nu)^2 + (105.7)^2

So,

E_mu = sqrt( (E_nu)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

But we also have E_mu + E_nu = 139.6.

Wait, earlier I thought E_mu + E_nu = 139.6, but that's not correct. Because E_mu is the total energy of the muon, which includes its rest mass, and E_nu is the total energy of the neutrino, which is all kinetic.

So the correct energy equation is:

E_mu + E_nu = m_pi c² = 139.6.

But E_mu is sqrt( (E_nu)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

So,

sqrt( (E_nu)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + E_nu = 139.6.

Let me let x = E_nu. Then,

sqrt( x² + (105.7)^2 ) + x = 139.6.

So,

sqrt( x² + 11,172.49 ) = 139.6 - x.

Square both sides:

x² + 11,172.49 = (139.6 - x)^2

Expand the right side:

= (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x²

So,

x² + 11,172.49 = 19,488.16 - 279.2 x + x²

Subtract x² from both sides:

11,172.49 = 19,488.16 - 279.2 x.

Rearrange:

279.2 x = 19,488.16 - 11,172.49

Compute 19,488.16 - 11,172.49.

19,488.16 minus 11,000 is 8,488.16. Then minus 172.49 gives 8,488.16 -172.49 = 8,315.67.

So,

279.2 x = 8,315.67

x = 8,315.67 / 279.2 ≈ Let's compute.

Divide numerator and denominator by 100: 83.1567 / 2.792 ≈ Let me compute 83.1567 / 2.792.

2.792 * 29 = approx 80. So, 2.792 * 29.7 ≈ 29.7 * 2.792.

29 *2.792 = 80.968, and 0.7*2.792=1.9544 → total ≈82.92. Close to 83.1567.

So x ≈29.7 MeV.

So E_nu (neutrino's energy) is about 29.7 MeV. Since it's a neutrino, its kinetic energy is approximately equal to its total energy (since m_nu is negligible), so K_nu ≈29.7 MeV.

Now, E_mu = sqrt( x² + (105.7)^2 ) = sqrt( (29.7)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Compute 29.7^2: approx 882.09. 105.7^2 is 11,172.49.

So sum is 882.09 + 11,172.49 = 12,054.58.

sqrt(12,054.58) ≈ 109.8 MeV.

So E_mu is 109.8 MeV. Since E_mu = m_mu c² (105.7) + K_mu, K_mu = E_mu - m_mu c² = 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.1 MeV.

Wait, but wait, earlier I thought E_mu + E_nu = 139.6. Wait, E_mu is 109.8 and E_nu is 29.7, sum is 139.5, which is close to 139.6. So that makes sense.

So the kinetic energies are:

K_mu = 4.1 MeV,

K_nu = 29.7 MeV.

Looking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That must be the correct one.

So the answer should be option D.

To determine the kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino in the decay of a stationary pion, we use energy and momentum conservation principles. The pion's rest mass energy is converted into the rest masses and kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino. The rest mass of the pion is 139.6 MeV, and the rest mass of the muon is 105.7 MeV. The neutrino is assumed to be massless.

### Energy Conservation
The total energy after the decay is the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino:
\[
E_{\mu} + E_{\nu} = m_{\pi} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
The muon's total energy is the sum of its rest energy and kinetic energy:
\[
E_{\mu} = m_{\mu} c^2 + K_{\mu}.
\]
The neutrino's total energy is purely kinetic:
\[
E_{\nu} = K_{\nu}.
\]
Substituting these into the energy conservation equation:
\[
K_{\mu} + K_{\nu} = m_{\pi} c^2 - m_{\mu} c^2 = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Momentum Conservation
Since the pion is stationary, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta:
\[
p_{\mu} = p_{\nu}.
\]
The energy-momentum relation for the muon is:
\[
E_{\mu}^2 = (p_{\mu} c)^2 + (m_{\mu} c^2)^2.
\]
For the neutrino, since it is massless:
\[
E_{\nu}^2 = (p_{\nu} c)^2.
\]
Equating the magnitudes of momentum:
\[
p_{\mu} c = p_{\nu} c = E_{\nu}.
\]
Substituting \(E_{\mu} = \sqrt{(E_{\nu})^2 + (m_{\mu} c^2)^2}\) into the energy conservation equation:
\[
\sqrt{(E_{\nu})^2 + (105.7)^2} + E_{\nu} = 139.6.
\]

### Solving for \(E_{\nu}\)
Let \(x = E_{\nu}\). The equation becomes:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + 11172.49} + x = 139.6.
\]
Rearranging:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + 11172.49} = 139.6 - x.
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
x^2 + 11172.49 = (139.6 - x)^2.
\]
Expanding the right-hand side:
\[
x^2 + 11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2x + x^2.
\]
Canceling \(x^2\) and rearranging:
\[
279.2x = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.
\]
Solving for \(x\):
\[
x = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.7 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
Thus, \(E_{\nu} = 29.7 \, \text{MeV}\), and since the neutrino's energy is purely kinetic:
\[
K_{\nu} = 29.7 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Solving for \(K_{\mu}\)
The muon's total energy is:
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{(E_{\nu})^2 + (m_{\mu} c^2)^2} = \sqrt{(29.7)^2 + (105.7)^2}.
\]
Calculating:
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{882.09 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12054.58} \approx 109.8 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
The muon's kinetic energy is:
\[
K_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} c^2 = 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.1 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \(4.1 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(29.7 \, \text{MeV}\), respectively. Comparing with the options, the closest match is:

**D) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.**

Answer: D

Okay, so I've got this physics problem about pions decaying into a muon and a neutrino. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me try to think this through.

The question states that a Pi(+) is at rest and decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV/c² and the muon is 105.7 MeV/c². Wait, the neutrino has such a tiny mass, I think it's considered massless in these kinds of problems. So its rest mass is effectively zero.

I remember that in such decay processes, energy and momentum are conserved. Since the pion is initially at rest, the total momentum of the products should be zero. So the muon and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. That makes sense because p is conserved.

But wait, the problem is asking for the kinetic energy of the product particles. Oh right, so each of them will have some kinetic energy, and the sum of their energies should add up to the available energy from the pion decay.

The available energy comes from the rest mass of the pion. When the pion decays, its rest mass energy (139.6 MeV) is converted into the rest masses of the muon and the neutrino, plus their kinetic energies.

So let's think about energy conservation. The total energy after decay should be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

The pion's energy is just its rest mass because it's stationary. So total energy is 139.6 MeV.

The muon's energy will be its rest mass plus its kinetic energy, E_mu = m_mu c² + K_mu. The neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy, since it's massless, E_nu = K_nu.

So putting it together:
139.6 = (105.7 + K_mu) + K_nu.

Also, from momentum conservation, since the pion is at rest, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So |p_mu| = |p_nu|.

The energy of each particle is related to their momentum and mass. For the muon: E_mu² = (p_mu c)² + (m_mu c²)². For the neutrino: E_nu² = (p_nu c)², since m_nu is zero.

Since p_mu = p_nu, let's call this shared momentum 'p'. So,

E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 )
E_nu = p c

Now, the total energy equation becomes:
139.6 = (105.7 + K_mu) + K_nu
But K_mu = E_mu - 105.7, and K_nu = E_nu.

So substituting,
139.6 = [sqrt( (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) - 105.7 ] + [p c ]

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. Let me rearrange it.

Let me denote E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2 ), so:

139.6 = (E_mu - 105.7) + (p c )

But E_mu is sqrt( (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2 ). Let me substitute that in.

139.6 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) - 105.7 + p c

Let me combine the terms:

sqrt( (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p c = 139.6 + 105.7 = 245.3

Hmm, so sqrt( (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p c = 245.3 MeV.

That's one equation with one unknown, p c. Let me let x = p c. So the equation becomes:

sqrt( x² + 105.7² ) + x = 245.3

I can rewrite this as sqrt(x² + 105.7² ) = 245.3 - x

Now square both sides to eliminate the square root:

x² + (105.7)^2 = (245.3 - x)^2

Expanding the right side:
= (245.3)^2 - 2*245.3 x + x²

So:
x² + (105.7)^2 = (245.3)^2 - 2*245.3 x + x²

Subtract x² from both sides:

(105.7)^2 = (245.3)^2 - 2*245.3 x

Now plug in the numbers.

Compute (105.7)^2: 105.7 * 105.7. Let me approximate. 100^2 is 10,000, 5.7^2 is around 32.49, and cross terms: 2*100*5.7=1140. So 10,000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11,172.49. So about 11,172.5 MeV².

(245.3)^2: Let's see, 245^2 is 60,025. 0.3^2 is 0.09. Then 2*245*0.3 = 147. So (245 + 0.3)^2 = 245^2 + 2*245*0.3 + 0.3^2 = 60,025 + 147 + 0.09 = 60,172.09 MeV².

So now:

11,172.5 = 60,172.09 - (2*245.3)x

Rearranging:

2*245.3 x = 60,172.09 - 11,172.5

Compute 60,172 - 11,172.5 = 49,000 approximately? Wait: 60,172.09 minus 11,172.5 is 49,000 - 0.41? Let me calculate:

60,172.09 - 11,172.5 = 49,000 - (11,172.5 - 11,172.09) = 49,000 - 0.41 = 48,999.59?

Wait, that can’t be right. Wait, 60,172.09 minus 11,172.5 is:

60,172.09
-11,172.50
=49,000. (Wait, 60,172.09 minus 11,172.5 is 49,000 approximately. Let me compute it more accurately.

60,172.09 - 11,172.5:

60,172.09
-11,172.50
=49,000 - 0.41 = 48,999.59 MeV².

So, 2*245.3 x = 48,999.59

Wait, 2*245.3 is 490.6.

So,

490.6 x = 48,999.59

x = 48,999.59 / 490.6 ≈ Let me compute that.

Divide numerator and denominator by 1000: 48.99959 / 0.4906 ≈ 48.9996 / 0.4906 ≈ Let me compute 49 / 0.4906 ≈ approximately 99.88.

Wait, 0.4906 * 100 is 49.06, so 0.4906 * 99.88 is about 49.06 * 100 = 4906, but wait I'm getting confused.

Wait, 490.6 is the denominator. 48,999.59 / 490.6 ≈ 48,999.59 / 490.6 ≈ Let's compute 490.6 * 100 = 49,060. So 48,999.59 is a bit less than 49,060. So 99.88 maybe. Wait, 490.6 * 99 = 490.6*(100-1)=49060 -490.6=48569.4. Hmm, so 490.6 * 99 = 48569.4.

But we have 48,999.59, which is 48,999.59 - 48,569.4 = 430.19 left.

So 430.19 /490.6 ≈ 0.876.

So x ≈ 99.876 MeV/c.

So p c ≈ 99.876 MeV/c.

Wait, but let me just take the approximate value as 99.88 MeV/c.

Now, E_nu = p c = 99.88 MeV.

E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) = sqrt( (99.88)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Compute 99.88^2: let's see, 100^2 is 10,000, 99.88 is 0.12 less. So (100 - 0.12)^2 = 100^2 - 2*100*0.12 + 0.12^2 = 10,000 -24 + 0.0144 ≈ 9976.0144.

105.7^2 is 11,172.49, as calculated before.

So (99.88)^2 + (105.7)^2 ≈ 9,976.01 + 11,172.49 = 21,148.5.

The square root of 21,148.5 is approximately 145.42 MeV.

So E_mu is about 145.42 MeV.

So K_mu = E_mu - m_mu c² = 145.42 - 105.7 = 39.72 MeV.

Wait, but wait. The neutrino's energy is 99.88 MeV. So the kinetic energies are 39.72 MeV for the muon and 99.88 MeV for the neutrino.

But wait, looking at the options, the KEs are lower. Hmm. Hmm, but wait, let me check the calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think again.

Wait, in the energy equation, I have:

Total energy after decay is 139.6 MeV. So,

E_mu + E_nu = 139.6.

But E_mu is sqrt( p^2 c^4 + m_mu^2 c^4 ) / c^2 ?

Wait, maybe I messed up the units. Let me clarify.

Wait, actually, the energy is in MeV. The equation is E_mu + E_nu = 139.6.

But E_mu is the total energy of the muon, which is m_mu c² (rest energy) plus K_mu (kinetic energy). So E_mu = m_mu c² + K_mu. Similarly, E_nu is the total energy of the neutrino, which is K_nu, since its rest mass is negligible.

So, the energy conservation equation is:

m_pi c² = (m_mu c² + K_mu) + K_nu

Which simplifies to:

K_mu + K_nu = m_pi c² - m_mu c² = (139.6 - 105.7) MeV = 33.9 MeV.

So K_mu + K_nu = 33.9 MeV.

But then, from momentum conservation, since the pion is at rest, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta.

So, p_mu = p_nu in magnitude but opposite in direction.

Expressing in terms of energy-momentum:

For the muon:

E_mu² = (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2

For the neutrino:

E_nu² = (p_nu c)^2

But p_mu = -p_nu, so their magnitudes are equal. So,

p_mu c = sqrt( E_nu^2 - (m_nu c²)^2 )

Wait, but m_nu is 0, so p_mu c = E_nu.

So, p_mu c = E_nu.

Substituting into the muon's equation:

E_mu² = (E_nu)^2 + (105.7)^2

So,

E_mu = sqrt( (E_nu)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

But we also have E_mu + E_nu = 139.6.

Wait, earlier I thought E_mu + E_nu = 139.6, but that's not correct. Because E_mu is the total energy of the muon, which includes its rest mass, and E_nu is the total energy of the neutrino, which is all kinetic.

So the correct energy equation is:

E_mu + E_nu = m_pi c² = 139.6.

But E_mu is sqrt( (E_nu)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

So,

sqrt( (E_nu)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + E_nu = 139.6.

Let me let x = E_nu. Then,

sqrt( x² + (105.7)^2 ) + x = 139.6.

So,

sqrt( x² + 11,172.49 ) = 139.6 - x.

Square both sides:

x² + 11,172.49 = (139.6 - x)^2

Expand the right side:

= (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x²

So,

x² + 11,172.49 = 19,488.16 - 279.2 x + x²

Subtract x² from both sides:

11,172.49 = 19,488.16 - 279.2 x.

Rearrange:

279.2 x = 19,488.16 - 11,172.49

Compute 19,488.16 - 11,172.49.

19,488.16 minus 11,000 is 8,488.16. Then minus 172.49 gives 8,488.16 -172.49 = 8,315.67.

So,

279.2 x = 8,315.67

x = 8,315.67 / 279.2 ≈ Let's compute.

Divide numerator and denominator by 100: 83.1567 / 2.792 ≈ Let me compute 83.1567 / 2.792.

2.792 * 29 = approx 80. So, 2.792 * 29.7 ≈ 29.7 * 2.792.

29 *2.792 = 80.968, and 0.7*2.792=1.9544 → total ≈82.92. Close to 83.1567.

So x ≈29.7 MeV.

So E_nu (neutrino's energy) is about 29.7 MeV. Since it's a neutrino, its kinetic energy is approximately equal to its total energy (since m_nu is negligible), so K_nu ≈29.7 MeV.

Now, E_mu = sqrt( x² + (105.7)^2 ) = sqrt( (29.7)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Compute 29.7^2: approx 882.09. 105.7^2 is 11,172.49.

So sum is 882.09 + 11,172.49 = 12,054.58.

sqrt(12,054.58) ≈ 109.8 MeV.

So E_mu is 109.8 MeV. Since E_mu = m_mu c² (105.7) + K_mu, K_mu = E_mu - m_mu c² = 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.1 MeV.

Wait, but wait, earlier I thought E_mu + E_nu = 139.6. Wait, E_mu is 109.8 and E_nu is 29.7, sum is 139.5, which is close to 139.6. So that makes sense.

So the kinetic energies are:

K_mu = 4.1 MeV,

K_nu = 29.7 MeV.

Looking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That must be the correct one.

So the answer should be option D.


To determine the kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino in the decay of a stationary pion, we use energy and momentum conservation principles. The pion's rest mass energy is converted into the rest masses and kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino. The rest mass of the pion is 139.6 MeV, and the rest mass of the muon is 105.7 MeV. The neutrino is assumed to be massless.

### Energy Conservation
The total energy after the decay is the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino:
\[
E_{\mu} + E_{\nu} = m_{\pi} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
The muon's total energy is the sum of its rest energy and kinetic energy:
\[
E_{\mu} = m_{\mu} c^2 + K_{\mu}.
\]
The neutrino's total energy is purely kinetic:
\[
E_{\nu} = K_{\nu}.
\]
Substituting these into the energy conservation equation:
\[
K_{\mu} + K_{\nu} = m_{\pi} c^2 - m_{\mu} c^2 = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Momentum Conservation
Since the pion is stationary, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta:
\[
p_{\mu} = p_{\nu}.
\]
The energy-momentum relation for the muon is:
\[
E_{\mu}^2 = (p_{\mu} c)^2 + (m_{\mu} c^2)^2.
\]
For the neutrino, since it is massless:
\[
E_{\nu}^2 = (p_{\nu} c)^2.
\]
Equating the magnitudes of momentum:
\[
p_{\mu} c = p_{\nu} c = E_{\nu}.
\]
Substituting \(E_{\mu} = \sqrt{(E_{\nu})^2 + (m_{\mu} c^2)^2}\) into the energy conservation equation:
\[
\sqrt{(E_{\nu})^2 + (105.7)^2} + E_{\nu} = 139.6.
\]

### Solving for \(E_{\nu}\)
Let \(x = E_{\nu}\). The equation becomes:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + 11172.49} + x = 139.6.
\]
Rearranging:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + 11172.49} = 139.6 - x.
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
x^2 + 11172.49 = (139.6 - x)^2.
\]
Expanding the right-hand side:
\[
x^2 + 11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2x + x^2.
\]
Canceling \(x^2\) and rearranging:
\[
279.2x = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.
\]
Solving for \(x\):
\[
x = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.7 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
Thus, \(E_{\nu} = 29.7 \, \text{MeV}\), and since the neutrino's energy is purely kinetic:
\[
K_{\nu} = 29.7 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Solving for \(K_{\mu}\)
The muon's total energy is:
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{(E_{\nu})^2 + (m_{\mu} c^2)^2} = \sqrt{(29.7)^2 + (105.7)^2}.
\]
Calculating:
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{882.09 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12054.58} \approx 109.8 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
The muon's kinetic energy is:
\[
K_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} c^2 = 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.1 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \(4.1 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(29.7 \, \text{MeV}\), respectively. Comparing with the options, the closest match is:

**D) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.**
