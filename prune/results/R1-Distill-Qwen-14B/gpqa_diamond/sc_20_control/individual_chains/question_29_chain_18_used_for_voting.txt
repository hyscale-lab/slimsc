Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about a barley cultivar with an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible, and it has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants. When they sequenced the gene, some changes occurred in the first exon.

The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. I remember that anti-nutritional compounds are often proteins, so maybe this gene codes for a protein that produces the compound. If the gene is mutated, it might not be expressed, thus reducing or eliminating the compound.

Looking at the options, each mutant has a different change in the DNA sequence. I need to see which mutation disrupts the gene's function.

First, let me compare each mutant's sequence to the intact gene. The intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Looking at the first part, the intact gene has TTTCTC. In mutant 1, it's TTCTAC. So the change is from CTC to CTA? Wait, let me count the letters.

Wait, maybe it's better to look for where the changes occur. Let me line them up:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA

Mutant 1: ATG TTT CT C GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC … TGA

Wait, so the 4th,5th,6th bases in the intact are TTT. In mutant 1, maybe it's TCT? Or wait, perhaps I should look for where the changes are. Oh, wait, looking at the start:

Intact: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATT...
Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATT...

So, in the first exon, the sequence changes from TTTCTC to TTCTAC. So, the first change is at position 4-5 perhaps? Let me see:

Original: ATG T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T ... 
Mutant1: ATG T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T ...

Wait, perhaps the first part is ATGTTTCTC vs ATGTTCTAC.

So the first four nucleotides after ATG are TTT and CT. In mutant 1, it's TCTAC. So perhaps a substitution from C to A? Or maybe an insertion or deletion?

Wait, no, the sequence length might be the same because all the options are presented as same length sequences.

So, in the intact, the first part is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

Mutant1: ATG TTT CT A CGC TGG...

Wait, maybe the intact is ATG TTT CT C, and mutant1 is ATG TTT CT A. So a substitution from C to A at position x. That would be a point mutation.

What's the effect of this? Let me think about the amino acids. The original sequence starts with ATG, which is methionine, the start codon.

In the original, the next codon is TTT, which is phenylalanine. Then CTC is leucine. So, first few amino acids: Met-Phe-Leu-Leu...

Mutant1: After ATG, the next is TTT (same), then perhaps the next codon is CTA. CTA is leucine. So same as before? Wait, no, in the original, the third codon is CTC (Leu), in mutant1, it's CTA (Leu). So that's a synonymous mutation, no change in amino acid. But then the next codon in the original is GCT (Ala), but in mutant1 it's CGC (Arg). Oh, wait, because the original is GCT (Ala), and mutant1 has CGC. So that's a change from Ala to Arg. So at that position, an amino acid substitution.

Wait, so the original has GCT (Ala) and mutant1 has CGC (Arg). So that's a change in the third codon. So the amino acid changes from Ala to Arg. So this is a missense mutation. But would that eliminate the anti-nutritional compound? Maybe not necessarily. Unless that specific amino acid is critical for the function.

But let's look at other mutants.

Mutant2: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Original: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATT...

So in mutant2, the first part is ATGTTCTAAGCT...

So, original is TTTCTCGC. Mutant2 is TTCTAAGC.

So the first few codons:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...
Mutant2: ATG TTT CT A AGC TGG...

Wait, let me do codon by codon.

Original: ATG (1-3), TTT (4-6), CTC (7-9), GCT (10-12), GGT (13-15), ACT (16-18), TCT (19-21), GTG (22-24), GAT (25-27), GAA (28-30), CAT (31-33), ATT (34-36), TAT (37-39), TGT (40-42), CGT (43-45), …, TGA (end).

Mutant2: ATG TTT CT A AGC TGG TAC TTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...

So after ATG, the next is TTT (same as original). Then codon 2: TCT (mutant) vs CTC (original). So that's a change from CTC (Leu) to TCT (Ser). So that's substitution from Leu to Ser.

Then next codon in original is GCT (Ala), but in mutant2, it's AGC (Ser). So another substitution.

Wait, in the original, codon 3 is CTC (Leu), codon 4 is GCT (Ala). In mutant2, codon3 is TCT (Ser), codon4 is AGC (Ser). So two amino acid changes here: Leu to Ser and Ala to Ser.

Hmm. So this would likely change the protein structure. But whether this disrupts the function is unclear.

Mutant3: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Original: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATT...

So, let's compare.

Original starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...

So, the first change is that the third codon in original is CTC (Leu), in mutant3 it's TAC (Tyr). So that's a substitution from Leu to Tyr. Then the next codon in original is GCT (Ala), in mutant3 it's GCT (still Ala?), wait:

Wait, let me see. Original at position 4-6 is TTT (Phe), 7-9 CTC (Leu), 10-12 GCT (Ala), 13-15 GGT (Gly), 16-18 ACT (Thr), etc.

Mutant3 after ATG is TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...

So from codon 3: CTC (Leu) → TAC (Tyr). Then codon4: GCT (Ala) → GCT (Ala, same?), then codon5: GGT → GGT? Or wait, perhaps I'm getting the positions wrong.

Wait, mutant3's sequence starts as ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

So, the first part is ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...

So, the original sequence after ATG is TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), etc.

In mutant3, after ATG, it's TTT (same), then TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), GTC (Val), ACT (Thr)... So, so the third codon is changed from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr), which is a substitution. Then fifth codon is ACT (Thr) in original, and in mutant3 it's GTC (Val). Wait, let me recheck.

Wait, original after TTT is CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant3: TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG...

So, codon3: CTC → TAC (Leu → Tyr)
codon4: GCT → GCT (Ala → Ala)
codon5: GGT → GGT (Gly → Gly)
codon6: ACT → GTC (Thr → Val)

So, in mutant3, the sixth codon is changed from ACT (Thr) to GTC (Val). So that's another substitution. So two amino acid changes: Tyr and Val instead of Leu and Thr. So this could disrupt the protein's function.

Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
So, comparing to original:

Original starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG...

So, codon3: CTC → TAC (Leu → Tyr)
codon4: GCT → GCT (Ala → Ala)
codon5: GGT → ACT (Gly → Thr)

Wait, because in mutant4, after TAC is GCT ACT (so original had GCT GGT ACT). So, the fifth codon in original is GGT (Gly) → in mutant4, it's ACT (Thr). So that's a substitution from Gly to Thr.

So in mutant4, two changes: Leu becomes Tyr at codon3, and Gly becomes Thr at codon5.

Hmm, what's the effect of these mutations on the gene's product? The anti-nutritional compound is likely a protein, so the gene encodes a protein. If the gene is non-functional, perhaps the compound isn't produced.

So, which mutation would disrupt the gene's function the most? Options are whether the mutations cause a frameshift, a stop codon, or a missense mutation that disrupts function.

Looking at the wildtype and the mutants, all of them have the same reading frame because their sequences are the same length. So no frameshifts.

Looking for any stop codons in the sequences.

Original ends with ...TGA, which is a stop codon (TGA is stop). So the gene is correctly ending with TGA.

In the mutants, do any have a stop codon introduced earlier?

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant1: Ends with ...CGC…TGA. So the last part is CGC... TGA. So the stop is at the end.

Mutant2: ...CGC…TGA. Same stop.

Mutant3: ...CGT…TGA. So stop is same.

Mutant4: ...CGT…TGA. Same.

So none of the mutations introduce an early stop codon. So they all produce a full-length protein, but with some amino acid substitutions.

So the question is which mutation would disrupt the function of the protein.

If the gene is responsible for the anti-nutritional compound, then disrupting its function would stop the compound's synthesis.

Which mutations would cause a loss of function?

Looking at the amino acid changes:

Mutant1: Changes from Ala (GCT) to Arg (CGC) in codon4, and perhaps others. So the first substitution was Leu to Leu (CTC to CTA in the same position? Wait, no, earlier analysis said it's CTC → CTA? Wait, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, let me re-examine Mutant1:

Original: ... CTC GCT ...

Mutant1: ... CTA CGC ...

Wait, in the original, the third codon is CTC (Leu), the fourth is GCT (Ala). In mutant1, third codon is CTA (Leu), fourth is CGC (Arg).

So, the first codon remains same, the second codon in the original is CTC (Leu), in mutant1 it's CTA (Leu), so same amino acid. Then the fourth codon changes from Ala (GCT) to Arg (CGC). So that's a substitution from Ala to Arg. So a missense mutation.

Mutant2: Third codon changes from CTC (Leu) to TCT (Ser), fourth from GCT (Ala) to AGC (Ser). So two missense mutations.

Mutant3: Third codon changes from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr), sixth codon from ACT (Thr) to GTC (Val). Two substitutions.

Mutant4: Third codon changes from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr), fifth codon from GGT (Gly) to ACT (Thr). Two substitutions.

So, each has a few substitutions, but which would most likely disrupt the function? If the mutation is in a critical region, like the start, it's more likely to affect function.

Wait, looking at the beginning of the gene, the first exon.

The first exon is the beginning of the gene, which often contains the start codon and the beginning of the protein. If the mutation is in an early codon, perhaps leading to a non-functional protein.

Looking at the changes:

Mutant1's only substitution in the first part is CGC (Arg) where there was GCT (Ala). So that's position 4 in the original.

Mutant2 has two substitutions early on, changing two amino acids.

Mutant3 and 4 have substitutions, but perhaps in less critical positions.

Wait, but which mutation would disrupt the gene the most? Maybe if a critical amino acid is changed, like in a catalytic site or binding region.

Alternatively, perhaps a nonsense mutation would be best, but none of the options have that.

Wait, but all the mutations are in the first exon. The first exon is likely part of the coding region, so any change here could affect the protein.

Another possibility: some of these mutations could create a premature stop codon if a stop codon is introduced earlier. But looking at each mutant, they all end with TGA, so no early stop.

Wait, perhaps the order of the codons is more important. Let's think about the reading frame.

Wait, all the mutations are point mutations, so the reading frame is maintained.

Which mutation would most likely disrupt the gene's function? Missense mutations can sometimes disrupt function, but it depends on which amino acids are changed.

Alternatively, is there a possibility that any of the mutations are in the promoter region? No, because the question states the mutations are in the target gene, and the changes are in the coding sequence of the first exon.

So, perhaps the best approach is to look for a mutation that changes a codon to a stop codon. But none of the options do that.

Alternatively, perhaps a mutation that disrupts the start codon would prevent translation. Let me check:

The start codon is ATG in all cases. So the first three nucleotides are ATG in all mutants. So the start codon is intact.

So, each mutant starts with ATG, so translation starts.

If the first few amino acids are changed, that might disrupt the protein's structure more severely.

Looking at the first few codons:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

Mutant1: ATG TTT CTC CGC (Wait, earlier I thought that the third codon became CTA, but perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check.

Wait, the original is:

5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant1 is:

5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So, the original starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT...

Mutant1 has ATG TTT CT A CGC...

Wait, perhaps I should line them up:

Original: positions 1-24 (as an example)
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT …

Mutant1:

ATG TTT CT A CGC TGG TAC TTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…

Wait, perhaps the original's first 12 nucleotides are ATG TTT CTC GCT (positions 1-12). Mutant1's first 12 are ATG TTT CT A CGC.

So, the third codon in the original is CTC (Leu), in mutant1, it's TAC (Tyr). Wait, no, wait:

Wait, the original's first 12 are:

1-3: ATG
4-6: TTT
7-9: CTC
10-12: GCT

Mutant1's first 12:

1-3: ATG
4-6: TTT (same)
7-9: TCA (Ser)
10-12: GCT (Ala) ?

Wait, the actual sequences:

Original: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACT... 

Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACT...

So, looking at the exact letters:

Original: positions 4-6: T T T → codon TTT (Phe)
Positions 7-9: C T C → CTC (Leu)
Positions 10-12: G C T → GCT (Ala)

Mutant1: positions 4-6: T T C → TCC (Ser) ? Wait, no, no. Let me count the letters:

Original: ATG T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T...
Mutant1: ATG T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T...

Wait, perhaps the original has TTTCTCGCTGGTACT... and mutant1 has TTCTACGCTGGTACT...

Wait, let me write the first part:

Original: ATG T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T...

Mutant1: ATG T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T...

So, the original's first 12 nucleotides are ATG TTT CTC GCT.

Mutant1's first 12 are ATG TTT CT A CGC.

Wait, that might not add up in terms of codons. Let me think in triplets:

Original: ATG (1-3), TTT (4-6), CTC (7-9), GCT (10-12), GGT (13-15), ACT (16-18), TCT (19-21), GTG (22-24), GAT (25-27), GAA (28-30), CAT (31-33), ATT (34-36), TAT (37-39), TGT (40-42), CGT (43-45), …, TGA.

Mutant1: ATG (1-3), TTT (4-6), CTA (7-9), CGC (10-12), GCT (13-15), GGT (16-18), ACT (17-19?), wait, I'm getting a bit tangled.

Perhaps it's easier to compare each triplet.

Original: positions 1-3: ATG
positions 4-6: TTT
positions 7-9: CTC
positions 10-12: GCT
positions 13-15: GGT
positions 16-18: ACT
positions 19-21: TCT
positions 22-24: GTG
and so on.

Mutant1:

positions 1-3: ATG
positions 4-6: TTT
positions 7-9: CT A → CTA (Leu)
positions 10-12: CGC (Arg)
positions 13-15: GCT (Ala)
Wait, line by line.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the protein product.

The original gene starts with Met-Phe-Leu-Leu-Ala-Gly-Thr-Ser-Cys-Trp-Glu-Glu-His-Ile-... etc.

Mutant1: The third codon is CTA (Leu), fourth is CGC (Arg), so the sequence becomes Met-Phe-Leu-Arg... instead of ...Ala.

Mutant2: Third codon is TCT (Ser), fourth is AGC (Ser), so Met-Phe-Ser-Ser...

Mutant3: Third codon is TAC (Tyr), fifth codon is GTC (Val). So Met-Phe-Tyr-Ala-Gly-Val...

Mutant4: Third codon is TAC (Tyr), fifth codon is ACT (Thr). So Met-Phe-Tyr-Ala-Thr...

Now, which of these changes is more likely to disrupt the protein function? It depends on where the changes occur. If the region is critical, like the active site, then even a single substitution could disrupt function. Alternatively, perhaps a substitution in an early codon could lead to a nonfunctional protein.

Wait, but all the mutations are in the first exon. The first exon is usually at the start of the coding sequence. So, any substitution in the early codons would affect the N-terminal of the protein, which might be critical for structure or function.

Looking at the options, which mutation causes a more drastic change in the protein structure?

Mutant3 changes two amino acids: Leu to Tyr and Thr to Val.

Mutant4 changes Leu to Tyr and Gly to Thr.

Mutant2 changes two amino acids to Ser.

Mutant1 changes Ala to Arg.

Which change is more likely to disrupt the protein?

Arginine is a charged, larger residue compared to alanine. Replacing Ala (small, nonpolar) with Arg (large, charged) could disrupt the protein structure, perhaps leading to a nonfunctional protein.

Alternatively, if the substitution is in a region that's not critical, the protein might still function.

But among the options, which mutation is the most likely to disrupt the gene's function.

Wait, another approach: think about which mutation would cause a nonfunctional protein. Maybe a frameshift would, but all are point mutations.

Alternatively, look for a nonsense mutation (stop codon), but none of them introduce that.

So, the best bet is a missense mutation that disrupts a critical region.

Wait, another thought: the first codon after the start is Phe in the original. If that's changed, but in the mutants, it's not changed. All have Phe still.

In mutant1, the third codon is Leu, same as original. Wait, no, in mutant1, the third codon is CTA (Leu) as original was CTC (Leu). So same amino acid.

The fourth codon in mutant1 is CGC (Arg), original was GCT (Ala). So that's a substitution from Ala to Arg.

So, in mutant1, the fourth amino acid is changed from Ala to Arg.

In mutant2, the fourth codon is AGC (Ser).

In mutant3, the third codon is Tyr and sixth is Val.

In mutant4, third codon is Tyr and fifth is Thr.

Hmm.

Which substitution is more likely to cause a loss of function?

Maybe a substitution in the fourth codon to a charged residue like Arg could disrupt a binding site or active site.

Alternatively, perhaps a substitution in the third codon (from Leu to Tyr) in mutants 3 and 4.

But without knowing the exact structure of the protein, it's hard to say which substitution is more disruptive.

Wait, another approach: which mutation would most likely cause a nonfunctional protein? A nonsense mutation (stop) is best, but none have that. Next, a frameshift, but all are point.

So, which of these mutations leads to a nonfunctional protein.

Alternatively, perhaps if the substitution creates a new splice site? But the question says the mutations are in the target gene's sequence, so probably in exons.

Wait, but the gene has introns; the exons are spliced. But the question says the changes are in the first exon area, so part of the exons.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substitution creates a premature stop codon, but in none of the options does that happen.

Wait, let me check:

Mutant1: ...CGC... TGA.

CGC is a codon for Arg, and then the stop is after that. So the protein would be full-length.

Same for others.

So, perhaps the best way is to see which mutation would most likely disrupt the function, perhaps by introducing a stop codon, but that's not the case.

Wait, maybe the mutation is in the promoter region? But the question says the mutations are in the target gene's coding sequence.

Another thought: suppose the mutation disrupts a crucial region, like the start codon or the beginning of the protein. But the start codon is intact in all.

Alternatively, perhaps a mutation that leads to a truncated protein due to a stop codon downstream? No, because all end with TGA.

Wait, perhaps a mutation that occurs in the first few codons, leading to a completely different protein structure.

Wait, but all have the first codon as ATG.

So, perhaps the answer is Mutant4 because it has an entire exon missing or something? Wait, looking back, the question says the gene has five exons and four introns. But the sequences provided are all the same length, so perhaps it's not an exon skipping or such.

Wait, looking at Mutant4's sequence:

Original: ...C GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant4: ...C GCT ACT TCT GTG...

Wait, so perhaps in Mutant4, the GGT codon (Gly) is changed to ACT (Thr). So, Gly to Thr substitution.

But would that disrupt the gene?

Alternatively, perhaps Mutant4's sequence has a larger change. Let me look again.

Mutant4's sequence is: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Wait, the original's first part is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

Mutant4's first part is ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...

So, codon3: CTC → TAC (Leu → Tyr)
codon5: GGT → ACT (Gly → Thr)

So, two substitutions.

Hmm.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the question is about disrupting the gene's ability to produce the compound. So, a knockout would be best. Missense mutations can be either partially or fully functional.

But without knowing which amino acids are critical, it's hard. So perhaps the question is more about which mutation is likely to cause a frameshift, but all are point mutations.

Alternatively, perhaps the best option is to look for a mutation that introduces a stop codon, but none do.

Wait, perhaps the mutation in mutant4 leads to a shorter protein due to a stop codon. Let me check.

Mutant4's sequence: ...TGA at the end. So the stop is at the same position.

So, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it has a larger deletion or something.

Wait, looking at the sequences again:

Original: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Wait, perhaps I should count the number of nucleotides.

Original: the first part is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Mutant4: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Comparing the length, they are the same. So no indels, only substitutions.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the best approach is to consider that the anti-nutritional compound is a protein, so perhaps the gene encodes an enzyme that produces it. If the enzyme's active site is altered, the compound won't be produced.

Which mutation is more likely to disrupt the active site? Perhaps a substitution in a critical residue.

But without knowing the exact structure, perhaps the best bet is that the mutation that alters more amino acids early in the protein is more likely to disrupt function.

Mutant3 has two substitutions in the early part (third and sixth codons), while mutant4 has substitutions in third and fifth.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, looking for which mutant has a change in the first exon that would disrupt the gene's product. The question says the changes are in the first exon area.

Wait, perhaps the best way is to look for a mutation that creates a stop codon, but earlier analysis shows none.

Alternatively, perhaps a nonsense mutation is not present, so the best approach is to find a mutation that causes a nonfunctional protein via missense.

Another angle: perhaps if a mutation occurs in the promoter region, but the question says the changes are in the gene's coding region.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the effect of each mutation.

Mutant1: Changes Ala to Arg.

Mutant2: Changes two codons to Ser.

Mutant3: Changes Leu to Tyr and Thr to Val.

Mutant4: Changes Leu to Tyr and Gly to Thr.

Which of these would disrupt the function? It's hard to say without more info.

But the question says that the correct mutation would eliminate the compound. So perhaps the correct mutation is a null mutation, which completely inactivates the gene.

But all the mutations are missense. So, perhaps the correct answer is the one where the first codon is changed, but in all, the first codon is ATG.

Ah! Wait a moment. Looking at Mutant4's sequence:

Original: ...GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant4: ...GCT ACT TCT GTG...

So, in the original, after the GCT comes GGT (Gly), then ACT (Thr).

In Mutant4, after GCT comes ACT (Thr) instead of GGT (Gly). So, GGT is replaced by ACT.

Which is Gly to Thr substitution.

But wait, perhaps in Mutant4, an entire codon is changed. Let me check the exact sequences.

Original first part (exon 1):

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG ...

Mutant4:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG ...

So, the third codon is TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu). The fifth codon is ACT (Thr) instead of GGT (Gly).

So, two substitutions.

Alternatively, perhaps in Mutant4, the GGT codon (Gly) is changed to ACT (Thr). So, Gly is replaced by Thr.

Wait, Gly is a small, non-reactive amino acid, and Thr is similar but has a hydroxyl group. Could this substitution disrupt a structural feature, like a glycine-rich region that allows flexibility?

If the mutation replaces a Gly with Thr in a region that requires flexibility, the protein might not function properly.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps none of the mutations are sufficient to eliminate the compound. But the question says one will.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it has a larger disruption, but I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant1 because it changes the codon from GCT (Ala) to CGC (Arg), which is a significant change.

But without knowing the exact effect, it's tricky.

Wait, another approach: which mutation would most likely disrupt the reading frame and lead to a nonfunctional protein. But all are point mutations with the same reading frame.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to look for a mutation that disrupts a critical region, such as the start codon or the beginning of the protein.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the mutation in mutant4 causes a frameshift, but no, the sequences are same length.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it has the most substitutions in the first exon, leading to a nonfunctional gene.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant3 because it has a substitution from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr) in the third codon, which is early in the gene.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the anti-nutritional compound is a protein, and the gene's product is needed for its synthesis. If the gene's product is nonfunctional, the compound won't be made.

Which mutation leads to a nonfunctional gene? Probably the one that creates a premature stop codon. But none of the options do that.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to find which mutation would lead to a nonfunctional protein, and of the given options, the best candidate is the one with the most disruptive mutation.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it has the shortest sequence change.

Wait, no, all have same length.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here. Perhaps I should think about each option.

The question asks which mutation will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. So the correct mutation would disrupt the gene's function.

Looking at the options:

A) Mutant2

B) Mutant3

C) Mutant1

D) Mutant4

Which of these changes would most likely disrupt the gene's function.

Another approach: perhaps the mutation in the first codon after ATG would have a bigger effect.

Looking again, the first codon after ATG is TTT (Phe) in all.

The third codon in the original is CTC (Leu). In Mutant1, it's CTA (Leu), same amino acid. So no change.

In Mutant2, the third codon is TCT (Ser), so substitution from Leu to Ser.

Wait, in the original, after ATG, the sequence is TTT CTC GCT GGT...

So the first few amino acids are Met-Phe-Leu-Leu-Ala...

Mutant2 changes the third codon (CTC → TCT) from Leu to Ser, and the fourth codon (GCT → AGC) from Ala to Ser.

So the first four amino acids become Met-Phe-Ser-Ser...

That's a significant change in the N-terminus, which might be critical for the protein's function.

Similarly, Mutant4 changes the third codon from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr) and the fifth from GGT (Gly) to ACT (Thr).

Which of these changes is more likely to disrupt the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the best way is to look for the mutation that introduces the most drastic change early in the gene. Which is Mutant2, as two early codons are changed to Ser.

But wait, in Mutant2, the fourth codon changes from GCT (Ala) to AGC (Ser). So, two substitutions in the N-terminal.

Alternatively, perhaps a substitution from Ala to Arg (Mutant1) is more disruptive because Arginine is a charged, polar residue, whereas Ala is small and nonpolar.

So, perhaps Mutant1's change would disrupt the structure more.

But I'm not certain.

Wait, another idea: maybe the correct answer is Mutant4 because it has a larger segment changed. Let me look at the sequences again.

Original: ...C GCT GGT ACT...

Mutant4: ...C GCT ACT...

Ah! Wait, in Mutant4's sequence, the GGT codon (Gly) is missing and replaced by ACT (Thr). So, perhaps that's a substitution, not a deletion.

Wait, no. The sequences are same length, so it's a substitution of GGT → ACT.

So, two nucleotides are changed, changing Gly to Thr.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it changes the structure in such a way that the protein is not produced.

But without more info, it's hard to tell.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it creates a stop codon. But earlier analysis shows that it doesn't. The stop is still at the end.

So, perhaps the best approach is to go with the mutation that creates the most drastic change in the amino acid sequence early on, which is Mutant2.

But I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because its mutation leads to the loss of a functional domain.

But honestly, I'm a bit stuck. I think the intended answer is Mutant4, perhaps because it alters more of the sequence in the first exon. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant1.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the mutation in Mutant1 leads to a change in the charge of the protein, which could disrupt its function.

But I'm not certain.

Given all that, I'll have to make an educated guess. The most likely option is that Mutant4 disrupts the gene's function by altering two critical amino acids early in the protein, leading to loss of function. So, the answer is D) Mutant4.

The question involves identifying which mutation in the first exon of a gene encoding an anti-nutritional compound would most likely eliminate the compound by disrupting the gene's function. The gene has five exons and four introns, and the mutations were introduced using EMS chemical mutagenesis. The goal is to determine which mutation would most effectively disrupt the protein's structure or function, thereby preventing the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.

### Key Analysis of Each Mutant:
1. **Intact Gene Sequence**:  
   The intact gene starts with `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA`. The first few codons encode the amino acids: Met-Phe-Leu-Leu-Ala-Gly-Thr-Ser-Cys-Trp-Glu-Glu-His-Ile-...

2. **Mutant 1**:  
   - Sequence: `ATG TTT CTC CGC TGG TAC TTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...TGA`.  
   - Changes:  
     - Codon 4: `GCT` (Ala) → `CGC` (Arg).  
   - Effect: Substitution of Ala (small, nonpolar) with Arg (large, charged) could disrupt the protein's structure or function.

3. **Mutant 2**:  
   - Sequence: `ATG TTT CT A AGC TGG TAC TTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...TGA`.  
   - Changes:  
     - Codon 3: `CTC` (Leu) → `TCT` (Ser).  
     - Codon 4: `GCT` (Ala) → `AGC` (Ser).  
   - Effect: Two substitutions early in the protein, changing Leu to Ser and Ala to Ser, which could significantly alter the N-terminal region and disrupt function.

4. **Mutant 3**:  
   - Sequence: `ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...TGA`.  
   - Changes:  
     - Codon 3: `CTC` (Leu) → `TAC` (Tyr).  
     - Codon 6: `ACT` (Thr) → `GTC` (Val).  
   - Effect: Substitutions in the early region, changing Leu to Tyr and Thr to Val, which could disrupt the protein's structure or function.

5. **Mutant 4**:  
   - Sequence: `ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...TGA`.  
   - Changes:  
     - Codon 3: `CTC` (Leu) → `TAC` (Tyr).  
     - Codon 5: `GGT` (Gly) → `ACT` (Thr).  
   - Effect: Substitutions in the early region, changing Leu to Tyr and Gly to Thr. Gly is often critical for flexibility, and its substitution with Thr could disrupt the protein's structure or function.

### Conclusion:
The anti-nutritional compound is likely a protein, and disrupting the gene's function would prevent its synthesis. Among the mutations, Mutant 4 introduces two substitutions in the early region of the gene, altering critical amino acids that may disrupt the protein's structure or function. While all mutations involve missense changes, Mutant 4's alterations are particularly significant and likely to have the most disruptive effect.

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about a barley cultivar with an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible, and it has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants. When they sequenced the gene, some changes occurred in the first exon.

The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. I remember that anti-nutritional compounds are often proteins, so maybe this gene codes for a protein that produces the compound. If the gene is mutated, it might not be expressed, thus reducing or eliminating the compound.

Looking at the options, each mutant has a different change in the DNA sequence. I need to see which mutation disrupts the gene's function.

First, let me compare each mutant's sequence to the intact gene. The intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Looking at the first part, the intact gene has TTTCTC. In mutant 1, it's TTCTAC. So the change is from CTC to CTA? Wait, let me count the letters.

Wait, maybe it's better to look for where the changes occur. Let me line them up:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA

Mutant 1: ATG TTT CT C GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC … TGA

Wait, so the 4th,5th,6th bases in the intact are TTT. In mutant 1, maybe it's TCT? Or wait, perhaps I should look for where the changes are. Oh, wait, looking at the start:

Intact: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATT...
Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATT...

So, in the first exon, the sequence changes from TTTCTC to TTCTAC. So, the first change is at position 4-5 perhaps? Let me see:

Original: ATG T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T ... 
Mutant1: ATG T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T ...

Wait, perhaps the first part is ATGTTTCTC vs ATGTTCTAC.

So the first four nucleotides after ATG are TTT and CT. In mutant 1, it's TCTAC. So perhaps a substitution from C to A? Or maybe an insertion or deletion?

Wait, no, the sequence length might be the same because all the options are presented as same length sequences.

So, in the intact, the first part is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

Mutant1: ATG TTT CT A CGC TGG...

Wait, maybe the intact is ATG TTT CT C, and mutant1 is ATG TTT CT A. So a substitution from C to A at position x. That would be a point mutation.

What's the effect of this? Let me think about the amino acids. The original sequence starts with ATG, which is methionine, the start codon.

In the original, the next codon is TTT, which is phenylalanine. Then CTC is leucine. So, first few amino acids: Met-Phe-Leu-Leu...

Mutant1: After ATG, the next is TTT (same), then perhaps the next codon is CTA. CTA is leucine. So same as before? Wait, no, in the original, the third codon is CTC (Leu), in mutant1, it's CTA (Leu). So that's a synonymous mutation, no change in amino acid. But then the next codon in the original is GCT (Ala), but in mutant1 it's CGC (Arg). Oh, wait, because the original is GCT (Ala), and mutant1 has CGC. So that's a change from Ala to Arg. So at that position, an amino acid substitution.

Wait, so the original has GCT (Ala) and mutant1 has CGC (Arg). So that's a change in the third codon. So the amino acid changes from Ala to Arg. So this is a missense mutation. But would that eliminate the anti-nutritional compound? Maybe not necessarily. Unless that specific amino acid is critical for the function.

But let's look at other mutants.

Mutant2: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Original: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATT...

So in mutant2, the first part is ATGTTCTAAGCT...

So, original is TTTCTCGC. Mutant2 is TTCTAAGC.

So the first few codons:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...
Mutant2: ATG TTT CT A AGC TGG...

Wait, let me do codon by codon.

Original: ATG (1-3), TTT (4-6), CTC (7-9), GCT (10-12), GGT (13-15), ACT (16-18), TCT (19-21), GTG (22-24), GAT (25-27), GAA (28-30), CAT (31-33), ATT (34-36), TAT (37-39), TGT (40-42), CGT (43-45), …, TGA (end).

Mutant2: ATG TTT CT A AGC TGG TAC TTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...

So after ATG, the next is TTT (same as original). Then codon 2: TCT (mutant) vs CTC (original). So that's a change from CTC (Leu) to TCT (Ser). So that's substitution from Leu to Ser.

Then next codon in original is GCT (Ala), but in mutant2, it's AGC (Ser). So another substitution.

Wait, in the original, codon 3 is CTC (Leu), codon 4 is GCT (Ala). In mutant2, codon3 is TCT (Ser), codon4 is AGC (Ser). So two amino acid changes here: Leu to Ser and Ala to Ser.

Hmm. So this would likely change the protein structure. But whether this disrupts the function is unclear.

Mutant3: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Original: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATT...

So, let's compare.

Original starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...

So, the first change is that the third codon in original is CTC (Leu), in mutant3 it's TAC (Tyr). So that's a substitution from Leu to Tyr. Then the next codon in original is GCT (Ala), in mutant3 it's GCT (still Ala?), wait:

Wait, let me see. Original at position 4-6 is TTT (Phe), 7-9 CTC (Leu), 10-12 GCT (Ala), 13-15 GGT (Gly), 16-18 ACT (Thr), etc.

Mutant3 after ATG is TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...

So from codon 3: CTC (Leu) → TAC (Tyr). Then codon4: GCT (Ala) → GCT (Ala, same?), then codon5: GGT → GGT? Or wait, perhaps I'm getting the positions wrong.

Wait, mutant3's sequence starts as ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

So, the first part is ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...

So, the original sequence after ATG is TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), etc.

In mutant3, after ATG, it's TTT (same), then TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), GTC (Val), ACT (Thr)... So, so the third codon is changed from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr), which is a substitution. Then fifth codon is ACT (Thr) in original, and in mutant3 it's GTC (Val). Wait, let me recheck.

Wait, original after TTT is CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant3: TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG...

So, codon3: CTC → TAC (Leu → Tyr)
codon4: GCT → GCT (Ala → Ala)
codon5: GGT → GGT (Gly → Gly)
codon6: ACT → GTC (Thr → Val)

So, in mutant3, the sixth codon is changed from ACT (Thr) to GTC (Val). So that's another substitution. So two amino acid changes: Tyr and Val instead of Leu and Thr. So this could disrupt the protein's function.

Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
So, comparing to original:

Original starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG...

So, codon3: CTC → TAC (Leu → Tyr)
codon4: GCT → GCT (Ala → Ala)
codon5: GGT → ACT (Gly → Thr)

Wait, because in mutant4, after TAC is GCT ACT (so original had GCT GGT ACT). So, the fifth codon in original is GGT (Gly) → in mutant4, it's ACT (Thr). So that's a substitution from Gly to Thr.

So in mutant4, two changes: Leu becomes Tyr at codon3, and Gly becomes Thr at codon5.

Hmm, what's the effect of these mutations on the gene's product? The anti-nutritional compound is likely a protein, so the gene encodes a protein. If the gene is non-functional, perhaps the compound isn't produced.

So, which mutation would disrupt the gene's function the most? Options are whether the mutations cause a frameshift, a stop codon, or a missense mutation that disrupts function.

Looking at the wildtype and the mutants, all of them have the same reading frame because their sequences are the same length. So no frameshifts.

Looking for any stop codons in the sequences.

Original ends with ...TGA, which is a stop codon (TGA is stop). So the gene is correctly ending with TGA.

In the mutants, do any have a stop codon introduced earlier?

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant1: Ends with ...CGC…TGA. So the last part is CGC... TGA. So the stop is at the end.

Mutant2: ...CGC…TGA. Same stop.

Mutant3: ...CGT…TGA. So stop is same.

Mutant4: ...CGT…TGA. Same.

So none of the mutations introduce an early stop codon. So they all produce a full-length protein, but with some amino acid substitutions.

So the question is which mutation would disrupt the function of the protein.

If the gene is responsible for the anti-nutritional compound, then disrupting its function would stop the compound's synthesis.

Which mutations would cause a loss of function?

Looking at the amino acid changes:

Mutant1: Changes from Ala (GCT) to Arg (CGC) in codon4, and perhaps others. So the first substitution was Leu to Leu (CTC to CTA in the same position? Wait, no, earlier analysis said it's CTC → CTA? Wait, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, let me re-examine Mutant1:

Original: ... CTC GCT ...

Mutant1: ... CTA CGC ...

Wait, in the original, the third codon is CTC (Leu), the fourth is GCT (Ala). In mutant1, third codon is CTA (Leu), fourth is CGC (Arg).

So, the first codon remains same, the second codon in the original is CTC (Leu), in mutant1 it's CTA (Leu), so same amino acid. Then the fourth codon changes from Ala (GCT) to Arg (CGC). So that's a substitution from Ala to Arg. So a missense mutation.

Mutant2: Third codon changes from CTC (Leu) to TCT (Ser), fourth from GCT (Ala) to AGC (Ser). So two missense mutations.

Mutant3: Third codon changes from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr), sixth codon from ACT (Thr) to GTC (Val). Two substitutions.

Mutant4: Third codon changes from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr), fifth codon from GGT (Gly) to ACT (Thr). Two substitutions.

So, each has a few substitutions, but which would most likely disrupt the function? If the mutation is in a critical region, like the start, it's more likely to affect function.

Wait, looking at the beginning of the gene, the first exon.

The first exon is the beginning of the gene, which often contains the start codon and the beginning of the protein. If the mutation is in an early codon, perhaps leading to a non-functional protein.

Looking at the changes:

Mutant1's only substitution in the first part is CGC (Arg) where there was GCT (Ala). So that's position 4 in the original.

Mutant2 has two substitutions early on, changing two amino acids.

Mutant3 and 4 have substitutions, but perhaps in less critical positions.

Wait, but which mutation would disrupt the gene the most? Maybe if a critical amino acid is changed, like in a catalytic site or binding region.

Alternatively, perhaps a nonsense mutation would be best, but none of the options have that.

Wait, but all the mutations are in the first exon. The first exon is likely part of the coding region, so any change here could affect the protein.

Another possibility: some of these mutations could create a premature stop codon if a stop codon is introduced earlier. But looking at each mutant, they all end with TGA, so no early stop.

Wait, perhaps the order of the codons is more important. Let's think about the reading frame.

Wait, all the mutations are point mutations, so the reading frame is maintained.

Which mutation would most likely disrupt the gene's function? Missense mutations can sometimes disrupt function, but it depends on which amino acids are changed.

Alternatively, is there a possibility that any of the mutations are in the promoter region? No, because the question states the mutations are in the target gene, and the changes are in the coding sequence of the first exon.

So, perhaps the best approach is to look for a mutation that changes a codon to a stop codon. But none of the options do that.

Alternatively, perhaps a mutation that disrupts the start codon would prevent translation. Let me check:

The start codon is ATG in all cases. So the first three nucleotides are ATG in all mutants. So the start codon is intact.

So, each mutant starts with ATG, so translation starts.

If the first few amino acids are changed, that might disrupt the protein's structure more severely.

Looking at the first few codons:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

Mutant1: ATG TTT CTC CGC (Wait, earlier I thought that the third codon became CTA, but perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check.

Wait, the original is:

5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant1 is:

5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So, the original starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT...

Mutant1 has ATG TTT CT A CGC...

Wait, perhaps I should line them up:

Original: positions 1-24 (as an example)
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT …

Mutant1:

ATG TTT CT A CGC TGG TAC TTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…

Wait, perhaps the original's first 12 nucleotides are ATG TTT CTC GCT (positions 1-12). Mutant1's first 12 are ATG TTT CT A CGC.

So, the third codon in the original is CTC (Leu), in mutant1, it's TAC (Tyr). Wait, no, wait:

Wait, the original's first 12 are:

1-3: ATG
4-6: TTT
7-9: CTC
10-12: GCT

Mutant1's first 12:

1-3: ATG
4-6: TTT (same)
7-9: TCA (Ser)
10-12: GCT (Ala) ?

Wait, the actual sequences:

Original: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACT... 

Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACT...

So, looking at the exact letters:

Original: positions 4-6: T T T → codon TTT (Phe)
Positions 7-9: C T C → CTC (Leu)
Positions 10-12: G C T → GCT (Ala)

Mutant1: positions 4-6: T T C → TCC (Ser) ? Wait, no, no. Let me count the letters:

Original: ATG T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T...
Mutant1: ATG T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T...

Wait, perhaps the original has TTTCTCGCTGGTACT... and mutant1 has TTCTACGCTGGTACT...

Wait, let me write the first part:

Original: ATG T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T...

Mutant1: ATG T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T...

So, the original's first 12 nucleotides are ATG TTT CTC GCT.

Mutant1's first 12 are ATG TTT CT A CGC.

Wait, that might not add up in terms of codons. Let me think in triplets:

Original: ATG (1-3), TTT (4-6), CTC (7-9), GCT (10-12), GGT (13-15), ACT (16-18), TCT (19-21), GTG (22-24), GAT (25-27), GAA (28-30), CAT (31-33), ATT (34-36), TAT (37-39), TGT (40-42), CGT (43-45), …, TGA.

Mutant1: ATG (1-3), TTT (4-6), CTA (7-9), CGC (10-12), GCT (13-15), GGT (16-18), ACT (17-19?), wait, I'm getting a bit tangled.

Perhaps it's easier to compare each triplet.

Original: positions 1-3: ATG
positions 4-6: TTT
positions 7-9: CTC
positions 10-12: GCT
positions 13-15: GGT
positions 16-18: ACT
positions 19-21: TCT
positions 22-24: GTG
and so on.

Mutant1:

positions 1-3: ATG
positions 4-6: TTT
positions 7-9: CT A → CTA (Leu)
positions 10-12: CGC (Arg)
positions 13-15: GCT (Ala)
Wait, line by line.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the protein product.

The original gene starts with Met-Phe-Leu-Leu-Ala-Gly-Thr-Ser-Cys-Trp-Glu-Glu-His-Ile-... etc.

Mutant1: The third codon is CTA (Leu), fourth is CGC (Arg), so the sequence becomes Met-Phe-Leu-Arg... instead of ...Ala.

Mutant2: Third codon is TCT (Ser), fourth is AGC (Ser), so Met-Phe-Ser-Ser...

Mutant3: Third codon is TAC (Tyr), fifth codon is GTC (Val). So Met-Phe-Tyr-Ala-Gly-Val...

Mutant4: Third codon is TAC (Tyr), fifth codon is ACT (Thr). So Met-Phe-Tyr-Ala-Thr...

Now, which of these changes is more likely to disrupt the protein function? It depends on where the changes occur. If the region is critical, like the active site, then even a single substitution could disrupt function. Alternatively, perhaps a substitution in an early codon could lead to a nonfunctional protein.

Wait, but all the mutations are in the first exon. The first exon is usually at the start of the coding sequence. So, any substitution in the early codons would affect the N-terminal of the protein, which might be critical for structure or function.

Looking at the options, which mutation causes a more drastic change in the protein structure?

Mutant3 changes two amino acids: Leu to Tyr and Thr to Val.

Mutant4 changes Leu to Tyr and Gly to Thr.

Mutant2 changes two amino acids to Ser.

Mutant1 changes Ala to Arg.

Which change is more likely to disrupt the protein?

Arginine is a charged, larger residue compared to alanine. Replacing Ala (small, nonpolar) with Arg (large, charged) could disrupt the protein structure, perhaps leading to a nonfunctional protein.

Alternatively, if the substitution is in a region that's not critical, the protein might still function.

But among the options, which mutation is the most likely to disrupt the gene's function.

Wait, another approach: think about which mutation would cause a nonfunctional protein. Maybe a frameshift would, but all are point mutations.

Alternatively, look for a nonsense mutation (stop codon), but none of them introduce that.

So, the best bet is a missense mutation that disrupts a critical region.

Wait, another thought: the first codon after the start is Phe in the original. If that's changed, but in the mutants, it's not changed. All have Phe still.

In mutant1, the third codon is Leu, same as original. Wait, no, in mutant1, the third codon is CTA (Leu) as original was CTC (Leu). So same amino acid.

The fourth codon in mutant1 is CGC (Arg), original was GCT (Ala). So that's a substitution from Ala to Arg.

So, in mutant1, the fourth amino acid is changed from Ala to Arg.

In mutant2, the fourth codon is AGC (Ser).

In mutant3, the third codon is Tyr and sixth is Val.

In mutant4, third codon is Tyr and fifth is Thr.

Hmm.

Which substitution is more likely to cause a loss of function?

Maybe a substitution in the fourth codon to a charged residue like Arg could disrupt a binding site or active site.

Alternatively, perhaps a substitution in the third codon (from Leu to Tyr) in mutants 3 and 4.

But without knowing the exact structure of the protein, it's hard to say which substitution is more disruptive.

Wait, another approach: which mutation would most likely cause a nonfunctional protein? A nonsense mutation (stop) is best, but none have that. Next, a frameshift, but all are point.

So, which of these mutations leads to a nonfunctional protein.

Alternatively, perhaps if the substitution creates a new splice site? But the question says the mutations are in the target gene's sequence, so probably in exons.

Wait, but the gene has introns; the exons are spliced. But the question says the changes are in the first exon area, so part of the exons.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substitution creates a premature stop codon, but in none of the options does that happen.

Wait, let me check:

Mutant1: ...CGC... TGA.

CGC is a codon for Arg, and then the stop is after that. So the protein would be full-length.

Same for others.

So, perhaps the best way is to see which mutation would most likely disrupt the function, perhaps by introducing a stop codon, but that's not the case.

Wait, maybe the mutation is in the promoter region? But the question says the mutations are in the target gene's coding sequence.

Another thought: suppose the mutation disrupts a crucial region, like the start codon or the beginning of the protein. But the start codon is intact in all.

Alternatively, perhaps a mutation that leads to a truncated protein due to a stop codon downstream? No, because all end with TGA.

Wait, perhaps a mutation that occurs in the first few codons, leading to a completely different protein structure.

Wait, but all have the first codon as ATG.

So, perhaps the answer is Mutant4 because it has an entire exon missing or something? Wait, looking back, the question says the gene has five exons and four introns. But the sequences provided are all the same length, so perhaps it's not an exon skipping or such.

Wait, looking at Mutant4's sequence:

Original: ...C GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant4: ...C GCT ACT TCT GTG...

Wait, so perhaps in Mutant4, the GGT codon (Gly) is changed to ACT (Thr). So, Gly to Thr substitution.

But would that disrupt the gene?

Alternatively, perhaps Mutant4's sequence has a larger change. Let me look again.

Mutant4's sequence is: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Wait, the original's first part is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

Mutant4's first part is ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...

So, codon3: CTC → TAC (Leu → Tyr)
codon5: GGT → ACT (Gly → Thr)

So, two substitutions.

Hmm.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the question is about disrupting the gene's ability to produce the compound. So, a knockout would be best. Missense mutations can be either partially or fully functional.

But without knowing which amino acids are critical, it's hard. So perhaps the question is more about which mutation is likely to cause a frameshift, but all are point mutations.

Alternatively, perhaps the best option is to look for a mutation that introduces a stop codon, but none do.

Wait, perhaps the mutation in mutant4 leads to a shorter protein due to a stop codon. Let me check.

Mutant4's sequence: ...TGA at the end. So the stop is at the same position.

So, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it has a larger deletion or something.

Wait, looking at the sequences again:

Original: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Wait, perhaps I should count the number of nucleotides.

Original: the first part is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Mutant4: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Comparing the length, they are the same. So no indels, only substitutions.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the best approach is to consider that the anti-nutritional compound is a protein, so perhaps the gene encodes an enzyme that produces it. If the enzyme's active site is altered, the compound won't be produced.

Which mutation is more likely to disrupt the active site? Perhaps a substitution in a critical residue.

But without knowing the exact structure, perhaps the best bet is that the mutation that alters more amino acids early in the protein is more likely to disrupt function.

Mutant3 has two substitutions in the early part (third and sixth codons), while mutant4 has substitutions in third and fifth.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, looking for which mutant has a change in the first exon that would disrupt the gene's product. The question says the changes are in the first exon area.

Wait, perhaps the best way is to look for a mutation that creates a stop codon, but earlier analysis shows none.

Alternatively, perhaps a nonsense mutation is not present, so the best approach is to find a mutation that causes a nonfunctional protein via missense.

Another angle: perhaps if a mutation occurs in the promoter region, but the question says the changes are in the gene's coding region.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the effect of each mutation.

Mutant1: Changes Ala to Arg.

Mutant2: Changes two codons to Ser.

Mutant3: Changes Leu to Tyr and Thr to Val.

Mutant4: Changes Leu to Tyr and Gly to Thr.

Which of these would disrupt the function? It's hard to say without more info.

But the question says that the correct mutation would eliminate the compound. So perhaps the correct mutation is a null mutation, which completely inactivates the gene.

But all the mutations are missense. So, perhaps the correct answer is the one where the first codon is changed, but in all, the first codon is ATG.

Ah! Wait a moment. Looking at Mutant4's sequence:

Original: ...GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant4: ...GCT ACT TCT GTG...

So, in the original, after the GCT comes GGT (Gly), then ACT (Thr).

In Mutant4, after GCT comes ACT (Thr) instead of GGT (Gly). So, GGT is replaced by ACT.

Which is Gly to Thr substitution.

But wait, perhaps in Mutant4, an entire codon is changed. Let me check the exact sequences.

Original first part (exon 1):

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG ...

Mutant4:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG ...

So, the third codon is TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu). The fifth codon is ACT (Thr) instead of GGT (Gly).

So, two substitutions.

Alternatively, perhaps in Mutant4, the GGT codon (Gly) is changed to ACT (Thr). So, Gly is replaced by Thr.

Wait, Gly is a small, non-reactive amino acid, and Thr is similar but has a hydroxyl group. Could this substitution disrupt a structural feature, like a glycine-rich region that allows flexibility?

If the mutation replaces a Gly with Thr in a region that requires flexibility, the protein might not function properly.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps none of the mutations are sufficient to eliminate the compound. But the question says one will.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it has a larger disruption, but I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant1 because it changes the codon from GCT (Ala) to CGC (Arg), which is a significant change.

But without knowing the exact effect, it's tricky.

Wait, another approach: which mutation would most likely disrupt the reading frame and lead to a nonfunctional protein. But all are point mutations with the same reading frame.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to look for a mutation that disrupts a critical region, such as the start codon or the beginning of the protein.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the mutation in mutant4 causes a frameshift, but no, the sequences are same length.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it has the most substitutions in the first exon, leading to a nonfunctional gene.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant3 because it has a substitution from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr) in the third codon, which is early in the gene.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the anti-nutritional compound is a protein, and the gene's product is needed for its synthesis. If the gene's product is nonfunctional, the compound won't be made.

Which mutation leads to a nonfunctional gene? Probably the one that creates a premature stop codon. But none of the options do that.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to find which mutation would lead to a nonfunctional protein, and of the given options, the best candidate is the one with the most disruptive mutation.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it has the shortest sequence change.

Wait, no, all have same length.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here. Perhaps I should think about each option.

The question asks which mutation will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. So the correct mutation would disrupt the gene's function.

Looking at the options:

A) Mutant2

B) Mutant3

C) Mutant1

D) Mutant4

Which of these changes would most likely disrupt the gene's function.

Another approach: perhaps the mutation in the first codon after ATG would have a bigger effect.

Looking again, the first codon after ATG is TTT (Phe) in all.

The third codon in the original is CTC (Leu). In Mutant1, it's CTA (Leu), same amino acid. So no change.

In Mutant2, the third codon is TCT (Ser), so substitution from Leu to Ser.

Wait, in the original, after ATG, the sequence is TTT CTC GCT GGT...

So the first few amino acids are Met-Phe-Leu-Leu-Ala...

Mutant2 changes the third codon (CTC → TCT) from Leu to Ser, and the fourth codon (GCT → AGC) from Ala to Ser.

So the first four amino acids become Met-Phe-Ser-Ser...

That's a significant change in the N-terminus, which might be critical for the protein's function.

Similarly, Mutant4 changes the third codon from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr) and the fifth from GGT (Gly) to ACT (Thr).

Which of these changes is more likely to disrupt the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the best way is to look for the mutation that introduces the most drastic change early in the gene. Which is Mutant2, as two early codons are changed to Ser.

But wait, in Mutant2, the fourth codon changes from GCT (Ala) to AGC (Ser). So, two substitutions in the N-terminal.

Alternatively, perhaps a substitution from Ala to Arg (Mutant1) is more disruptive because Arginine is a charged, polar residue, whereas Ala is small and nonpolar.

So, perhaps Mutant1's change would disrupt the structure more.

But I'm not certain.

Wait, another idea: maybe the correct answer is Mutant4 because it has a larger segment changed. Let me look at the sequences again.

Original: ...C GCT GGT ACT...

Mutant4: ...C GCT ACT...

Ah! Wait, in Mutant4's sequence, the GGT codon (Gly) is missing and replaced by ACT (Thr). So, perhaps that's a substitution, not a deletion.

Wait, no. The sequences are same length, so it's a substitution of GGT → ACT.

So, two nucleotides are changed, changing Gly to Thr.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it changes the structure in such a way that the protein is not produced.

But without more info, it's hard to tell.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it creates a stop codon. But earlier analysis shows that it doesn't. The stop is still at the end.

So, perhaps the best approach is to go with the mutation that creates the most drastic change in the amino acid sequence early on, which is Mutant2.

But I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because its mutation leads to the loss of a functional domain.

But honestly, I'm a bit stuck. I think the intended answer is Mutant4, perhaps because it alters more of the sequence in the first exon. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant1.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the mutation in Mutant1 leads to a change in the charge of the protein, which could disrupt its function.

But I'm not certain.

Given all that, I'll have to make an educated guess. The most likely option is that Mutant4 disrupts the gene's function by altering two critical amino acids early in the protein, leading to loss of function. So, the answer is D) Mutant4.


The question involves identifying which mutation in the first exon of a gene encoding an anti-nutritional compound would most likely eliminate the compound by disrupting the gene's function. The gene has five exons and four introns, and the mutations were introduced using EMS chemical mutagenesis. The goal is to determine which mutation would most effectively disrupt the protein's structure or function, thereby preventing the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.

### Key Analysis of Each Mutant:
1. **Intact Gene Sequence**:  
   The intact gene starts with `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA`. The first few codons encode the amino acids: Met-Phe-Leu-Leu-Ala-Gly-Thr-Ser-Cys-Trp-Glu-Glu-His-Ile-...

2. **Mutant 1**:  
   - Sequence: `ATG TTT CTC CGC TGG TAC TTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...TGA`.  
   - Changes:  
     - Codon 4: `GCT` (Ala) → `CGC` (Arg).  
   - Effect: Substitution of Ala (small, nonpolar) with Arg (large, charged) could disrupt the protein's structure or function.

3. **Mutant 2**:  
   - Sequence: `ATG TTT CT A AGC TGG TAC TTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...TGA`.  
   - Changes:  
     - Codon 3: `CTC` (Leu) → `TCT` (Ser).  
     - Codon 4: `GCT` (Ala) → `AGC` (Ser).  
   - Effect: Two substitutions early in the protein, changing Leu to Ser and Ala to Ser, which could significantly alter the N-terminal region and disrupt function.

4. **Mutant 3**:  
   - Sequence: `ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...TGA`.  
   - Changes:  
     - Codon 3: `CTC` (Leu) → `TAC` (Tyr).  
     - Codon 6: `ACT` (Thr) → `GTC` (Val).  
   - Effect: Substitutions in the early region, changing Leu to Tyr and Thr to Val, which could disrupt the protein's structure or function.

5. **Mutant 4**:  
   - Sequence: `ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...TGA`.  
   - Changes:  
     - Codon 3: `CTC` (Leu) → `TAC` (Tyr).  
     - Codon 5: `GGT` (Gly) → `ACT` (Thr).  
   - Effect: Substitutions in the early region, changing Leu to Tyr and Gly to Thr. Gly is often critical for flexibility, and its substitution with Thr could disrupt the protein's structure or function.

### Conclusion:
The anti-nutritional compound is likely a protein, and disrupting the gene's function would prevent its synthesis. Among the mutations, Mutant 4 introduces two substitutions in the early region of the gene, altering critical amino acids that may disrupt the protein's structure or function. While all mutations involve missense changes, Mutant 4's alterations are particularly significant and likely to have the most disruptive effect.
