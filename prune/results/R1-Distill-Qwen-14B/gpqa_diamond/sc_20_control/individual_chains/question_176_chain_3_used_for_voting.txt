Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me see if I can work through it step by step.

The problem says that the state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but in quantum mechanics, states are supposed to be normalized, right? So I should probably check if this vector is normalized. Oh wait, the vector given has elements (-1, 2, 1), so let me calculate the norm. The dot product would be (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6), so the state isn't normalized. But wait, in quantum mechanics, states are represented as unit vectors. Hmm, maybe the state is given without normalization, or perhaps I need to normalize it before proceeding. Let me think about that. Since the problem is about measurements, perhaps the state is already normalized, or the measurements won't depend on the actual norm but the relative probabilities.

Wait, but for the probabilities to make sense, the state should be normalized. So maybe the state is (-1, 2, 1) divided by sqrt(6). Oh, but the problem doesn't mention that. Hmm. I'm a bit confused here. Maybe the state is given in a certain basis, but perhaps I'll proceed under the assumption that it's not normalized, but I need to normalize it before calculating probabilities.

Wait, no, in quantum mechanics, the state vector must be a unit vector. So perhaps the given state is (-1, 2, 1)/sqrt(6), because 1^2 +2^2 +1^2 = 6. So the actual state vector is |ψ> = 1/sqrt(6) * [ -1; 2; 1 ].

Wait, but the problem just says the column matrix has elements (-1, 2, 1). So maybe we should normalize it. Because without normalization, the probabilities might not add up correctly. Let me proceed with the assumption that the state is |ψ> = [ -1; 2; 1 ] / sqrt(6).

Next, the operators P and Q are given. The operator for P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me write that down. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Second row: (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)). Third row: (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So the matrix P looks like this:

[ 0       1/sqrt(2)   0 ]
[1/sqrt(2) 0       1/sqrt(2) ]
[ 0       1/sqrt(2)   0 ]

And the operator Q has a matrix:

[1 0 0]
[0 0 0]
[0 0 -1]

So Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. So the possible outcomes when measuring Q are 1, 0, and -1.

The question is about measuring P first and then Q, and finding the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, but the measurement of P first, then Q. So the process is: first measure P, which will collapse the system into an eigenstate of P. Then, measure Q on that collapsed state. The probability we're looking for is the product of the probabilities of each step—first getting 0 for P, then in that state, getting -1 for Q.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the order. Wait, the problem says: measure Q just after the measurement of P. So first P is measured, then Q. So the overall probability is the probability of P=0 multiplied by the probability that, given P=0, Q=-1.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find the probability that when measuring P and then Q, you get P=0 and Q=-1. So that's the same as the probability that the system ends up in an eigenstate of P corresponding to 0, and then in that state, the eigenstate of Q gives -1.

Wait, but how do the measurements interact? Let me think. When you measure P, the system collapses into an eigenstate of P. So if P=0 is one of its eigenvalues, after measurement, the state is the corresponding eigenvector. Then, when you measure Q on that state, you get the eigenvalue of Q for that state.

But wait, the operator Q might not share eigenvectors with P, so the measurement after P could lead to a state that's an eigenvector of P, but when you apply Q to that, the eigenvalues depend on whether the P eigenstate is also an eigenstate of Q.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to first find the probabilities of each possible outcome of P, then for each of those, the probability of Q's outcome, and multiply them.

Wait, but in this case, the problem is about the probability of P=0 and then Q=-1. So perhaps the approach is:

1. Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.

2. Determine the probability that measuring P gives 0. That's the first part.

3. Then, for the state after P=0 (which is the eigenvector corresponding to P=0), measure Q to get -1. So the probability is the inner product squared of that eigenvector with the eigenvector of Q corresponding to -1.

Wait, but let me think step by step.

First, find the eigenvalues of P.

The operator P is given as:

Row 1: [0, 1/√2, 0]

Row 2: [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]

Row 3: [0, 1/√2, 0]

Hmm. Let me write this as a matrix:

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

To find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - λ I) = 0.

Let's compute the determinant.

The matrix P - λ I is:

[ -λ, 1/√2, 0 ]

[1/√2, -λ, 1/√2 ]

[ 0, 1/√2, -λ ]

Computing the determinant:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] 
- (1/√2) [ (1/√2)(-λ) - 0 ] 
+ 0 * [ ... ]

Wait, perhaps it's easier to expand along the first row.

So:

det = (-λ) * det [ [-λ, 1/√2], [1/√2, -λ] ] 
          - (1/√2) * det [ [1/√2, 1/√2], [0, -λ] ] 
          + 0 * det(...)

So:

det = (-λ) [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] 
       - (1/√2) [ (1/√2)(-λ) - 0*(1/√2) ) ]

Compute each part:

First term: (-λ)[ λ^2 - (1/2) ]

Second term: - (1/√2) [ (-λ/√2) ]

Which is: - (1/√2) * (-λ/√2) ) → the two denominators multiply to 2: (1/√2)*(1/√2) = 1/2 → so it's -(1/√2)*(-λ/√2) = (λ)/(2)

So putting it all together:

det = (-λ)(λ² - 1/2) + λ/2

Expand the first term: -λ³ + (λ)(1/2)

So overall:

det = -λ³ + (λ/2) + (λ/2) = -λ³ + λ.

Set det = 0:

-λ³ + λ = 0 → λ ( -λ² + 1 ) = 0 → λ = 0, λ = ±1.

So the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, and -1.

Wait, that's interesting. So when measuring P, possible outcomes are 1, 0, -1.

Now, the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue.

Let me find the eigenvectors for λ=0.

We solve (P - 0 I) v = 0 → P v = 0.

So for λ=0, the matrix becomes:

[ 0, 1/√2, 0 ]

[1/√2, 0, 1/√2 ]

[0, 1/√2, 0 ]

We can write the system as:

Row 1: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0 v3 = 0 → v2 = 0.

Row 2: (1/√2) v1 + 0 v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 → v1 + v3 = 0 → v1 = -v3.

Row 3: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0 v3 = 0 → same as row 1, which gives v2=0.

So substituting v2=0, and v1 = -v3.

So the eigenvector can be expressed as v = [v1, 0, v3]^T, and since v1 = -v3, it's [v3, 0, -v3]^T.

We can choose v3 as a parameter, say, v3 = t.

So the eigenvector is t * [1, 0, -1]^T.

So the eigenvector for λ=0 is proportional to [1; 0; -1].

Wait, but let me check. Let me plug into P.

P times [1; 0; -1] would be:

Row 1: 0*1 + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(-1) = 0.

Row 2: (1/√2)*1 + 0*0 + (1/√2)*(-1) = (1/√2)(1 -1) )= 0.

Row 3: 0*1 + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(-1) = 0.

So yes, it's an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0.

Now, for normalization, the length of [1; 0; -1] is sqrt(1^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2)) [1; 0; -1].

Wait, but wait, the state given is |ψ> = [ -1; 2; 1 ] / sqrt(6). So when I measure P, the probability of getting 0 is the square of the inner product between |ψ> and the eigenvector of P corresponding to 0.

So the eigenvector for P=0 is |e0> = (1/sqrt(2)) [1; 0; -1].

The inner product <e0 | ψ> is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1] · [ -1; 2; 1 ].

Wait, but wait, ψ is [ -1; 2; 1 ] / sqrt(6), so the inner product is (1/sqrt(2)) * [1*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1)(1)] / sqrt(6).

Which is (1/sqrt(2)) * [ -1 + 0 -1 ] / sqrt(6) = (1/sqrt(2)) * (-2)/sqrt(6).

Simplify: (-2)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) )= (-2) / sqrt(12) = (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) )= (-1)/sqrt(3).

The square of the absolute value is (1/3), because | (-1)/sqrt(3) |^2 is 1/3.

So the probability of getting P=0 is 1/3.

Now, once P=0 is measured, the state collapses to the eigenvector |e0>, which is (1/sqrt(2)) [1; 0; -1].

Now, we measure Q in this state.

The operator Q has matrix:

[1, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, -1]

So the eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1.

The eigenvectors are as follows:

For Q=1: [1;0;0]

For Q=0: any vector in the subspace orthogonal to [1;0;0] and [0;0;1], so for example, any vector of the form [0, a, 0], where a is a scalar.

For Q=-1: [0;0;1]

Wait, so the eigenvectors for Q are:

|q1> = [1;0;0] (eigenvalue 1),

|q0> = [0;1;0] (eigenvalue 0),

|q-1> = [0;0;1] (eigenvalue -1).

Wait, wait a second. Let me check Q's matrix. The (2,2) element is 0, which is the only non-zero in row 2 and column 2. So for Q=0, any vector in the subspace where the first and third components are zero, but the second can be anything. So the eigenvectors for Q=0 are all vectors of the form [0, a, 0], where a is a real number.

So the eigenvector for Q=-1 is [0,0,1], normalized, so |q-1> = [0;0;1].

Now, we have the state after measuring P=0 as |e0> = (1/sqrt(2)) [1; 0; -1 ].

We need to compute the probability that measuring Q gives -1.

The probability is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between |e0> and |q-1>.

Compute <q-1 | e0>.

|q-1> is [0,0,1], so the inner product is (0)(1/sqrt(2)) + 0*(0) + (1) * (-1/sqrt(2)).

Wait, wait, |e0> is (1/sqrt(2)) [1; 0; -1 ] → the third component is (-1/sqrt(2)).

So <q-1 | e0> is (0)(1/sqrt(2)) + 0*(0) + (1) * (-1/sqrt(2)) ) = (-1/sqrt(2)).

The absolute value squared is (1/2).

So the probability of measuring Q=-1 after P=0 is 1/2.

Now, the overall probability is the product of the probabilities: P=0 (which is 1/3) multiplied by Q=-1 given P=0 (which is 1/2) → 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

But wait, the options are A) 1/2, B)1/3, C)2/3, D)1/6.

So the answer would be D) 1/6.

Wait, but wait a moment. Let me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, the state normalization: the initial state is [ -1; 2;1 ] / sqrt(6) because 1^2 +2^2 +1^2=6. Correct.

Eigenvalues of P: 0,1,-1. Correct.

Eigenvector for P=0 is [1;0;-1]/sqrt(2). Correct.

Inner product with ψ: (-1/sqrt(3)) → squared magnitude 1/3. Correct.

After measuring P=0, state is [1;0;-1]/sqrt(2).

Then, to measure Q, the state is projected onto each eigenvector of Q.

When we measure Q, the possible outcomes are 1, 0, and -1.

The inner product with |q-1> is (-1/sqrt(2)) → |inner|^2 is 1/2. So probability 1/2.

So yes, the overall probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6. So option D is correct.

The problem involves determining the probability of measuring 0 for the observable \( P \) and \(-1\) for the observable \( Q \) in sequence for a given quantum state. The state of the system is provided as \((-1, 2, 1)\), which is not normalized. The norm is calculated as \(\sqrt{6}\), so the normalized state is:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \( P \)
The operator \( P \) is given by:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

Solving for the eigenvalues of \( P \), we find the eigenvalues to be \( 0, 1, -1 \). The eigenvector corresponding to \( P = 0 \) is:

\[
|e_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Probability of measuring \( P = 0 \)
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between \( |\psi\rangle \) and \( |e_0\rangle \):

\[
\langle e_0 | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Calculating the inner product:

\[
\langle e_0 | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \left( 1 \cdot (-1) + 0 \cdot 2 + (-1) \cdot 1 \right) = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
|\langle e_0 | \psi \rangle|^2 = \left| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Thus, the probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

### Step 3: Probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) after \( P = 0 \)
The operator \( Q \) is diagonal:

\[
Q = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvector corresponding to \( Q = -1 \) is:

\[
|q_{-1}\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

After measuring \( P = 0 \), the state collapses to \( |e_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} \). The probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between \( |e_0\rangle \) and \( |q_{-1}\rangle \):

\[
\langle q_{-1} | e_0 \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
|\langle q_{-1} | e_0 \rangle|^2 = \left| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 4: Overall probability
The overall probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) in sequence is the product of the two probabilities:

\[
P(P=0, Q=-1) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{1}{6}}.
\]
