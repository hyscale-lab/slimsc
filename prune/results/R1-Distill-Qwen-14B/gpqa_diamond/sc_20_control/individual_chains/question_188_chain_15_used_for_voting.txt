Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty on my interplanar distances and all that. Let me think through this step by step.

The question gives me a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that a rhombohedral crystal is a type of hexagonal crystal system, but wait, no, wait. Oh right, rhombohedral is one of the seven crystal systems. It's based on the rhombohedron, which has all edges equal and all angles equal. So, in a rhombohedral crystal, the unit cell is a rhombohedron, meaning all a, b, c are equal, and all angles α, β, γ are the same. In this case, the angles are given as 30 degrees each.

The interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance in a crystal usually refers to the distance between adjacent atoms, right? But in a rhombohedral structure, the atoms are at the corners of the rhombohedron, so the interatomic distance is the edge length, which is a. So a = 10 Angstroms.

The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. The interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal. I remember that the formula for interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos α + kl cos β + lh cos γ) ) )

Wait, no, wait. I think I messed that up. Oh right, the formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos α + hk cos α + hk cos α) )

Wait, no, no, the general formula is:

d_{hkl}² = a² (h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hk cos α ??? Wait, no. Let me think again. I think it's:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos α + kl cos β + lh cos γ) )

But in the case of a rhombohedral crystal, since a = b = c and α = β = γ, the formula simplifies. So substituting α for all the angles, and a for all the lattice parameters.

So for a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance formula becomes:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos α - 2kl cos α )

Wait, no. Let me get this right. Wait, another approach: for a cubic system, the formula is a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But rhombohedral isn't cubic, so we have to adjust for the angles.

Wait, the formula I remember is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos α + hk cos α + hk cos α) ) )

Wait, no. Let me look for the correct formula. Oh wait, I think I should refer to the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with a, b, c not necessarily equal and angles between them not 90 degrees.

The general formula is:

1/d² = (h²/a²)(1/sin² α) + (k²/b²)(1/sin² β) + (l²/c²)(1/sin² γ) ... no, wait, I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, the formula is based on the Miller indices h, k, l and the cosines of the angles between the lattice vectors.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula from the book. Oh right! The general formula for d_{hkl} is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos α - 2kl cos α ) ) * (a/ sqrt( (1 + (2 - cos α)(cos β cos γ - sin² α/2)) )) ) ... No, that's getting complicated. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the metric tensor.

Alternatively, for a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal lattice vectors can be used. Hmm, but maybe it's easier to look for a simplified formula for rhombohedral systems.

Wait, another approach: In a rhombohedral system, a = b = c = a0 (let's say). The angles are all the same, α. The interplanar distance for a plane (hkl) is given by:

d = a0 / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2(hk + hk + hk) cos α )

Wait, because in this case, the cross terms are the same. Wait, no, wait, the formula for d is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2 (hk cos α + hk cos α + hk cos α) )

Wait, that would be d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 6hk cos α )

Wait, that can't be right because the cross terms would be hk cos α, hk cos α, and hk cos α, but that's only if all the angles are between the same axes. No, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, the general formula for d_{hkl} in a rhombohedral crystal is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2(hk + hk + hk) cos α )

Wait, no. Let me think again. The correct formula for a rhombohedral system is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - (2hk cos α + 2hl cos α + 2kl cos α) )

But wait, in rhombohedral, all angles are equal, so α = β = γ.

But wait, in the general case, the formula is:

d^2 = (a^2 (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2 a^2 (hk cos γ + hk cos γ + ... )) / (something). Hmm, perhaps I should find an alternative way.

Wait, looking for a more precise formula. Maybe the formula is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2(hk cos α + hk cos α + hk cos α) )

Wait, but that seems to have three terms each of 2hk cos α. Hmm, but that would be 6hk cos α. No, that can't be right because for a simple cubic (α=90), that would give d= a / sqrt( h² +k² + l² ), which is correct. So in the cubic case, the cross terms would be zero because cos 90 is zero.

Wait, but in the general case, the formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ )

But in a rhombohedral system, α=β=γ, so it simplifies to:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos α - 2kl cos α )

Which can be written as:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2 cos α (hk + hl + kl) )

So for the (111) plane, h, k, l are all 1.

So substituting, h=1, k=1, l=1, and α=30 degrees.

So compute the denominator:

h² +k² +l² = 1 + 1 + 1 =3.

Now the cross terms: 2 cos α (hk + hl + kl) = 2 cos(30) (1*1 +1*1 +1*1) = 2 cos(30) * 3 = 6 cos(30).

So denominator inside sqrt is 3 - 6 cos(30 degrees).

Wait, cos(30) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So 6 * 0.8660 ≈ 5.196.

So 3 -5.196 = -2.196. Wait, but that's negative. Oh wait, that can't be right because the square root would be imaginary. That suggests a problem.

Wait, I must have made a mistake in the formula. Did I get the signs right? Because in the denominator, it's 2hk cos α, etc., subtracted from the sum of squares.

Wait, the formula is d^2 = (a^2) [h² +k² +l² - 2 hk cos α - 2 hk cos β - 2 hl cos γ ] / (a²). Wait, no, the denominator is inside the sqrt, so the formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2 (hk cos α + hk cos β + ...) )

Wait, perhaps I confused the formula. Let me go back. The general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles α, β, γ is:

1/d² = ( (h/a)^2 + (k/b)^2 + (l/c)^2 ) - 2 ( (hk cos γ)/(a b) + (hl cos β)/(a c) + (lk cos α)/(b c) ) )

But in the rhombohedral case, a = b = c, and α = β = γ = 30 degrees.

So this becomes:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - 2 (hk cos α)/(a²) - 2 (hl cos α)/(a²) - 2 (kl cos α)/(a² )

Factor out 1/a²:

1/d² = [ h² + k² + l² - 2 hk cos α - 2 hl cos α - 2 kl cos α ] / a²

So,

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Which brings us back to:

d = a / sqrt(3 - 6 cos α ) since h=k=l=1.

Wait, but again, cos α is 30 degrees, which is about 0.866.

So 3 - 6 * 0.866 ≈ 3 - 5.196 ≈ -2.196.

Wait, that's negative, which doesn't make sense because the denominator inside the sqrt would be negative, leading to an imaginary number. That can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Hmm, maybe I mixed up the angles. Oh wait, in a rhombohedral system, the angles between the axes are all alpha, but is each angle the angle between a pair of axes, like alpha between a and b, beta between b and c, gamma between c and a? So for rhombohedral, alpha = beta = gamma. So perhaps the formula is correct, but I'm getting a negative value, which suggests that perhaps the (111) planes are not possible in this structure, or that I have made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I've messed up the formula and the cross terms should have a minus sign, but that would lead to the denominator being 3 - 6*(0.866), which is negative, which is impossible. So perhaps I have the formula wrong.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2 (hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos gamma) )

Wait, that would change the sign. Let me think again about the derivation.

Wait, the formula for interplanar distance in terms of the reciprocal lattice is given by:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos gamma )

Wait, but wait, that's if it's a cubic system with angles, but perhaps I'm getting the formula wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2 (hk cos α + hl cos α + kl cos α) )

Wait, but I'm not sure. I think I should try to derive the formula correctly.

Another approach: For a cubic system, the interplanar distance is a / sqrt(h² +k² + l²). But for a rhombohedral system, which is a generalization, the formula adjusts for the angles.

Wait, from Ashcroft and Mermin's "Solid State Physics," perhaps. Let me think: the interplanar spacing for a crystal is given by:

d_{hkl} = ( (a^2 (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2 a^2 (hk cos α + hk cos β + hk cos gamma )) )^{-1/2}

Wait, no, that's not precise. Alternatively, the reciprocal is given by:

1/d^2 = (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)/a^2 - 2 (hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α)/(a^2)

Because in the general case, the angles between the axes are alpha (between b and c), beta (between a and c), and gamma (between a and b). So for rhombohedral, all these angles are equal to alpha.

So substituting:

1/d^2 = (h^2 +k^2 + l^2 - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos alpha ) / a^2

Thus,

d = a / sqrt( h^2 +k^2 + l^2 - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

So for h=k=l=1,

d = a / sqrt(3 - 6 cos alpha )

Wait, but this brings us back to the same problem: 3 -6 * cos(30) is 3 -6*(sqrt(3)/2) )= 3 -3*sqrt(3) ≈ 3 -5.196 = -2.196, which is negative.

That's impossible, so perhaps I have the formula wrong.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h^2 +k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

Because in the cubic case, cos 90 is zero, so d is a/sqrt( h² +k² + l² ), which is correct. So perhaps the correct formula is with a plus sign.

Wait, so if I have:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

Then for (111), it's a / sqrt(3 + 6 cos alpha )

Which would make sense, as cos 30 is positive, so 3 + 6*(0.866) = 3 +5.196=8.196.

Then sqrt(8.196) is about 2.865, so d = 10 / 2.865 ≈ 3.49, but none of the options are close to that.

Wait, but the options are 8.95, 9.08, etc. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check online. Oh wait, I can't do that, but I have to think through.

Another approach: perhaps the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is given by:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (2 hk cos alpha + 2 hl cos alpha + 2 kl cos alpha) )

Wait, but in that case, for (111), it's 3 - 6 * 0.866 =3-5.196= -2.196, which is negative. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I have the formula wrong, and the correct formula uses the sum of the cosines with positive signs. That would make the denominator 3 + 5.196=8.196, leading to d=10/sqrt(8.196)= about 3.49 Angstroms. But none of the options match that.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that I'm using the wrong formula. Another idea: perhaps in the formula, the denominator includes the sum of h² +k² +l² plus twice the sum of the products of the indices times cosines.

Wait, in a cubic system, the formula is a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² ), so when angles are 90 degrees, cos is zero, so any cross terms vanish. So in general, the formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2 (hk cos alpha + ... ) )

Wait, but what's the correct formula? I'm getting confused.

Alternative approach: I'll look for the correct formula from a textbook. From what I recall, the general formula is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h/a)^2 + (k/b)^2 + (l/c)^2 - 2 (hk cos gamma)/(a b) - 2 (hl cos beta)/(a c) - 2 (kl cos alpha)/(b c) ) )

But for rhombohedral, a = b = c, and alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees.

So substituting:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos gamma - 2hl cos beta - 2kl cos alpha )

Since all angles are 30°, this becomes:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² +k² + l² - 2hk cos 30 - 2hl cos 30 - 2kl cos 30 )

Which is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² +k² + l² - 2 cos30 ( hk + hl + kl ) )

So for (111), h=k=l=1, we get:

d = a / sqrt(3 - 2 * cos30 * (1*1 +1*1 +1*1) )

= 10 / sqrt(3 - 6 * cos30 )

Calculate this:

cos30 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So 6 * 0.8660 ≈5.196.

So denominator inside sqrt is 3-5.196= -2.196 → negative. This can't be right because the sqrt of a negative number is imaginary, which doesn't make sense for a real interplanar distance.

Hmm, this suggests I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait a minute, perhaps I messed up the signs in the formula. Let me think again. Maybe the formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

In that case, for (111):

d = 10 / sqrt(3 +6 * cos30 )

= 10 / sqrt(3 +5.196 )

= 10 / sqrt(8.196 )

sqrt(8.196) is about 2.864.

So 10 / 2.864 ≈3.49 Angstroms.

But that's not one of the options. The options are around 8-10 Angstroms. So maybe this approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

Wait, same as before, leading to same issue.

Wait, maybe I'm missing a factor. Another thought: perhaps in the rhombohedral system, the formula uses the reciprocal of the lattice parameters. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the formula. Let me think about the structure factor. The interplanar distance is given by:

d = |F| / (h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + ... )

No, perhaps that's not relevant.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to find a reliable source. Oh wait, I can't, but perhaps I can think about the Laue equations or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² +k² + l² - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Wait, but that leads to the same issue as before.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² +k² + l² + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Which for (111) would give 3 +6 cos alpha= 3+6*(√3/2)=3 +3√3=approx 3+5.196=8.196. So sqrt(8.196)= ~2.86, d=10/2.86≈3.49 Angstroms. Still not matching any options.

Hmm, but the options are 8-10, which is much larger than 3. So perhaps the formula is different. Maybe I got the formula wrong, and the denominator is not squared.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / ( sqrt( h² +k² +l² ) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

Wait, but that doesn't seem dimensionally correct. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal is given by:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - (hk + hl + kl) * 2 cos alpha )

But again, for (111), this would be 3 - (3) * 2 * 0.866 =3-5.196= -2.196, which is not possible.

Wait, perhaps the formula actually has a plus instead of a minus. So, 3 + 5.196 =8.196, sqrt is 2.86, d=10/2.86≈3.49. Still not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) - (hk + hl + kl) * 2 cos alpha )

But this brings us back to the same problem.

Wait, perhaps I have to think in terms of the reciprocal lattice. Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the reciprocal of the metric tensor.

The metric tensor for a rhombohedral system is:

a_ij = [ 1, cos alpha, cos alpha;
          cos alpha, 1, cos alpha;
          cos alpha, cos alpha, 1 ]

Wait, so the reciprocal metric tensor a^ij is [A], where A is the inverse of the metric tensor.

But perhaps this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, the formula for d_{hkl} is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

But then, 1/d^2 = (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

Which would make d = 1 / sqrt( ... ), but that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the reciprocal lattice. Let me think again.

Wait, I think I'm stuck. Let me try a different approach.

Another thought: the interplanar distance for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral system can be found using the formula:

d = a / sqrt(3 (1 - cos alpha) )

Wait, where did I get that? Let me think. If all the terms in the denominator are similar, perhaps I can factor them.

Wait, for h=k=l=1, the denominator in the general formula is 3 - 6 cos alpha. Wait, but that leads to negative, which can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt(3 (1 - cos alpha) )

Which would make:

d = 10 / sqrt(3*(1- cos 30°)) )

cos 30≈0.866 → 1-0.866=0.134.

3 *0.134=0.402.

sqrt(0.402)= approx 0.634.

So d=10 /0.634≈15.76, which is way higher than the options.

Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for a rhombohedral crystal is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

Which for (111) is:

d=10 / sqrt(3 +6 *0.866)=10/sqrt(8.196)=~3.49.

But the options are around 9, so that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I've misunderstood the question. Could it be that the crystal is simple cubic, and I'm overcomplicating with rhombohedral formula? No, the question says rhombohedral.

Another thought: perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2)(1 - cos alpha) + ... )

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / (sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) (1 - cos alpha) ) )

But that seems unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system for (111) is:

d = a / sqrt( (1 + 1 + 1) (1 - cos alpha) + ... )

Wait, not sure.

Wait, maybe I should look for an alternative approach. The interplanar distance is the distance between two adjacent lattice planes. For a rhombohedral structure, the planes (111) are spaced by d.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / ( sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos alpha ) )

Wait, but that brings us back to the same problem.

Wait, unless the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

Which for (111) is 3 -6*0.866= -2.196 which is negative. So that again doesn't make sense.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let's think about the structure.

In a rhombohedral system, the atoms are at the corners of a rhombohedron. The (111) planes are planes that cut through the lattice points. The interplanar distance is the distance between two adjacent such planes.

Wait, perhaps using the vector approach. The normal vector to the (111) plane in a rhombohedral system can be found using the reciprocal basis vectors.

The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

b1 = (a/(a²)) (1, 0, 0) )? No, perhaps I should think in terms of the metric tensor.

Alternatively, the reciprocal basis vectors are given by:

b1 = (1/a) (1, 1, 1) × ... Wait, perhaps that's not the right way.

Alternatively, the normal vector to the (111) plane is proportional to (1,1,1). The interplanar distance is the component of the lattice vectors along this normal, normalized.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the dot product of the lattice vectors with the normal vector.

Wait, the plane equation is (hkl)·(r) = d, but I'm not sure.

Another approach: The interplanar distance can be found by considering the projection of the unit cell edge along the normal vector of the plane.

The normal vector to the (111) plane is (1,1,1). The length of this vector is sqrt(1^2 +1^2 +1^2)=sqrt(3).

The unit vector in this direction is (1,1,1)/sqrt(3).

The distance between two planes is the projection of the vector connecting two adjacent points in the lattice onto this normal vector.

The vector connecting two adjacent points in the (111) direction is a*(1,1,1), but wait, in rhombohedral, the lattice vectors are a, with angles between them.

Wait, perhaps the vector from one lattice point to the next in the direction of the (111) plane is a*(1,1,1). So the displacement vector is a*(1,1,1).

The distance between planes is the component of this vector perpendicular to the plane. Since the normal vector is (1,1,1), the displacement vector along this normal is (a*(1,1,1)) · (1,1,1)/sqrt(3) ) => (3a)/sqrt(3) = a*sqrt(3).

So the distance between planes would be a*sqrt(3) / (number of planes along this direction). Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the interplanar distance d is given by:

d = |a*(1,1,1)| * cos(theta )

where theta is the angle between the displacement vector and the normal.

Wait, |a*(1,1,1)| is a * sqrt(3).

The angle theta between the displacement vector and the normal (which is the same direction) is zero, but perhaps that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance is the projection of the displacement vector onto the normal direction, divided by the number of unit cells.

Wait, perhaps this approach is getting me nowhere.

Another Idea: The interplanar distance for (111) in a rhombohedral structure can be calculated using the formula:

d = a / sqrt(1 + (2hkl)/(h^2 +k^2 + l^2) )

Wait, that seems too vague.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

Which for (111) gives:

3 - 6 cos 30.

Which is 3 -5.196 = -2.196 → which is negative, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps this formula is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that in a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance for (111) is given by a / sqrt(3(1 - cos alpha)).

So, a=10, alpha=30.

Compute:

3*(1 - cos30) =3*(1 -0.866)=3*(0.134)=0.402.

sqrt(0.402)= approx 0.634.

d=10 / 0.634 ≈15.76 Angstroms, which isn't one of the options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure in terms of a cube. Let me imagine that a rhombohedral system can be viewed as a cube that's been stretched or compressed along the space diagonals. But I'm not sure.

Another Idea: Maybe the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

Which for (111):

3 +6 *0.866=3+5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)=approx 2.864.

d=10 /2.864≈3.49 Angstroms. Still doesn't match the options.

Wait, but the options are in the 8-10 range. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 3 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2*(hk +... ) * cos alpha ) multiplied by something else.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the metric. The volume of the unit cell in a rhombohedral system is a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 alpha + 2 cos^3 alpha ), but that might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps the reciprocal of the interplanar distance squared is equal to:

(h^2 +k^2 +l^2)/a^2 + terms involving cosines.

Wait, perhaps I should compute this for the given parameters.

Wait, 1/d² = (h² +k² + l²)/(a²) - 2 (hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha )/(a²)

But for rhombohedral, all angles are alpha.

So,

1/d² = (3)/(10^2) - 2 (1*1 cos30 + 1*1 cos30 + 1*1 cos30 )/(10^2)

= (3/100) - 2*(3*(sqrt(3)/2 )) /100

= (3/100) - (3*sqrt(3)) / 100

= (3 - 3*1.732)/100

= (3 -5.196)/100

= (-2.196)/100

Which is negative, so again impossible.

Hmm. This suggests that perhaps my formula is wrong, and that the (111) planes are not possible in this rhombohedral system, but that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps I should take the absolute value. So,

1/d² = | (3 -5.196)/100 | = 2.196/100.

Thus, d²=100/2.196= approx 45.56.

d= sqrt(45.56)= approx 6.75 Angstroms.

But that still isn't matching the options.

Wait, the options are around 9 Angstroms. So perhaps I have a mistake in the formula.

Another Idea: Perhaps the formula should have a negative sign in the denominator. So,

1/d² = (3 + 5.196)/100 →8.196/100 →d^2=100/8.196≈12.2 →d≈3.49 Angstroms.

No, that's the same as before.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos alpha ) )

But that would give d=10 * sqrt(8.196)=10*2.864≈28.64, which is way too big.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

But with the absolute value taken, leading to

d=10 / sqrt( |3 -5.196| )=10/sqrt(2.196)=10/1.48≈6.75 Angstroms.

Which is close to option B (8.95) or A (9.08), but not exactly matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a calculation error. Let me re-calculate 3 -5.196 as 2.196, which is positive when taking absolute value.

So, sqrt(2.196)= approx 1.48.

d=10 /1.48≈6.75 Angstroms. Not matching any options.

Hmm. None of the options are close to this. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula altogether.

Another Idea: Maybe the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d = a / sqrt( (h +k + l)^2 - 2 (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) (1 - cos alpha) )

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / ( sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos alpha ) )

But again, same problem.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is d = a / sqrt( 3(1 - cos alpha) ), which for (111), would give:

d=10 / sqrt(3*(1 - 0.866))=10/sqrt(3*(0.134))=10/sqrt(0.402)=10/0.634=15.76.

Not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the interplanar distance is given by the inverse of the square root of the sum of the squares of the reciprocal lattice indices. So in reciprocal space, the (111) plane corresponds to a point (1,1,1), and the interplanar distance is the reciprocal of the length of that vector in reciprocal space.

The reciprocal space vectors, for a rhombohedral system, are given by:

b1 = (1, 1, 1)/a * (1/(sqrt(1 + 2 cos alpha))) )

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, the reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

b1 = (1, 0, 0) in real space, but transformed according to the metric.

No, perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Another Idea: Perhaps I can look up the formula. Wait, I think the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

But then, as before, it leads to a negative denominator for (111) in this case.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

Which gives:

d =10 / sqrt(3 +6 *0.866)=10 /sqrt(8.196)= ~3.49.

But the options are much higher.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me think about the options. The options are A)9.08, B)8.95, C)9.54, D)10.05.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula and the correct answer is a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) * something )

Wait, another Idea: Perhaps the formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / ( sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) ) * sqrt(1 - cos alpha) )

Which would give:

d=10 / ( sqrt(3) * sqrt(1 -0.866) )

sqrt(3)=1.732, sqrt(0.134)=0.366.

So denominator is 1.732 *0.366≈0.634.

d=10 /0.634= approx 15.76. Not matching options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl)(1 - cos alpha) )

Which for (111):

3 +6*(1 -0.866)=3+6*(0.134)=3+0.804=3.804.

sqrt(3.804)=1.95.

d=10 /1.95≈5.13 Angstroms.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that in the rhombohedral system, the (111) planes are not possible because the denominator is negative, but that can't be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the inverse of the metric tensor.

The metric tensor for a rhombohedral system is:

G = [ 1, cos alpha, cos alpha;
       cos alpha, 1, cos alpha;
       cos alpha, cos alpha, 1 ]

The inverse of G is needed to compute the reciprocal lattice vectors.

The determinant of G is:

det(G) = 1*(1*1 - cos^2 alpha) - cos alpha*(cos alpha *1 - cos alpha * cos alpha) + cos alpha*(cos alpha * cos alpha - 1 * cos alpha )

= 1*(1 - cos² alpha) - cos alpha [ cos alpha (1 - cos alpha) ) ] + cos alpha [ cos² alpha - cos alpha ]

= (1 - cos^2 alpha) - cos alpha ( cos alpha - cos^2 alpha ) + cos alpha ( cos^2 alpha - cos alpha )

= 1 - cos² alpha - cos^2 alpha + cos^3 alpha + cos^3 alpha - cos^2 alpha.

=1 -3 cos^2 alpha + 2 cos^3 alpha.

The inverse of G is (1/det(G)) * [ [1, -cos alpha, -cos alpha],
                                      [-cos alpha, 1, -cos alpha],
                                      [-cos alpha, -cos alpha, 1] ]

So the reciprocal lattice vectors are:

b1 = (1, -cos alpha, -cos alpha) / (sqrt(det(G)))

Similarly for b2 and b3.

Wait, but the interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos alpha ) )

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to compute the reciprocal of the plane.

Wait, perhaps the interplanar distance is given by the reciprocal of the length of the vector in reciprocal space.

For the (111) plane, the vector in reciprocal space is (1,1,1). The length of this vector is sqrt(1^2 +1^2 +1^2 )=sqrt(3).

But in real space, the reciprocal of this would be the interplanar distance.

Wait, but the length in reciprocal space is sqrt(3), so the real space interplanar distance is 1/sqrt(3) multiplied by a factor.

Wait, perhaps the interplanar distance is given by:

d = 1 / (sqrt(3) * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 alpha + 2 cos^3 alpha) )

Which comes from the determinant of the metric tensor.

Wait, the determinant of G is 1 -3 cos^2 alpha + 2 cos^3 alpha.

So:

d = 1 / sqrt(3 * det(G)^(1/3) )

Wait, no, perhaps I should think of the volume of the unit cell, which is a^3 * sqrt(1 -3 cos^2 alpha +2 cos^3 alpha).

But I'm not sure how this relates to the interplanar distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance is given by:

d = a / ( sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos alpha ) )

But again, for (111), this would give a negative denominator.

Wait, I'm really stuck here. Let's consider that the correct answer is option B)8.95 Angstroms.

How could that happen?

If we compute d=10 / sqrt( (3) + 6 * cos(30) ), which is 10 / sqrt(3 +5.196)=10/sqrt(8.196)= ~3.49. Not matching.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) (1 - cos alpha) )

=10 / sqrt(3 +6*(1 - 0.866)) →3 +6*(0.134)=3+0.804=3.804.

sqrt(3.804)=1.95.

d=10 /1.95≈5.13. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) * 2 cos alpha )

Which for (111) gives:

3 -3*2 *0.866=3-5.196= -2.196.

I think I'm stuck. Perhaps I should proceed by making an educated guess.

Wait, looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is option B)8.95.

But how?

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

=10 / sqrt(3 + 6 *0.866 )

=10/sqrt(8.196)≈3.49.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in h, k, l. Did the question ask for (1 1 1), which is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A)9.08 Angstroms.

Let me check, what would give me 9.08. Suppose the denominator is 1.104.

Because 10 /1.104≈9.05.

So 1.104^2=1.219.

How to get 1.219 from the denominator.

Wait, the denominator inside the sqrt is (h² +k² +l² - 2(...)).

Wait, perhaps the denominator is 1.219.

So, 3 - 2* (some term) =1.219 → 2 * (some term)=3 -1.219=1.781 → some term=0.8905.

But that's not possible since the term is 6 cos 30=5.196.

Hmm. I'm not getting anywhere.

Perhaps I should give up and think that the correct answer is option B)8.95.

But how?

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

Which we've already determined gives d≈3.49.

None of the options match, so perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps the angles given are 30 degrees, which are the angles between the lattice vectors, but perhaps in the formula, I should use 180-30=150 degrees. Because maybe the angle between the vectors is the obtuse angle.

Wait, in crystallography, the angle between the lattice vectors is often the acute angle, but perhaps I should use 180-30=150 degrees.

Wait, cos(150°)= -√3/2≈-0.866.

So, let's try that.

For the formula:

d = a / sqrt(3 - 6 cos alpha )

But with alpha=150°, cos(150)= -0.866.

So,

3 -6*(-0.866)=3 +5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)=2.864.

d=10 /2.864≈3.49. Still not matching.

Hmm.

Another Idea: Perhaps the formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

But with alpha=150°, cos= -0.866.

So,

3 +6*(-0.866)=3-5.196=-2.196. Again negative.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck and will have to make an educated guess. The options suggest that the answer is either 8.95 or 9.08. Let me think that perhaps the formula is:

d= a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

Which gives 3 +6*0.866=8.196 → d=10/sqrt(8.196)= ~3.49. No. But perhaps the formula is the reciprocal.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

Which would give 10 * sqrt(8.196)=10*2.864≈28.64. No.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the denominator as (3 - 6 cos alpha ), take the absolute value, then take reciprocal.

So:

d = a / sqrt( |3 -6 cos alpha| )

For alpha=30°, 3-6*0.866= -2.196 → absolute is 2.196.

sqrt(2.196)= approx 1.48.

d=10 /1.48≈6.75 Angstroms.

Still not matching options.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the formula is:

d = a / sqrt(3 (1 - cos alpha) )

Which gives:

d=10 / sqrt(3*(1-0.866))=10/sqrt(3*0.134)=10/sqrt(0.402)=10/0.634≈15.76.

Nope.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities and can't find a formula that gives an answer matching the options. Perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the interplanar distance is the same as the edge length when using the (111) plane in a cubic system, which is 10 / sqrt(3)≈5.77, but that's not an option either. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula and the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

But with the denominator being 3 -6*0.866= -2.196.

Taking the absolute value, 2.196, sqrt=1.48, d=6.75. Not an option.

Hmm.

Perhaps I should accept that I don't know the correct formula and make a guess based on the options. The only option near 10 Angstroms is D)10.05, but that seems unlikely. Another option is B)8.95.

Wait, perhaps I should compute:

d = a / sqrt(3 + 6*(1 - cos alpha) )

Which would be 3 +6*(1 -0.866)=3+6*(0.134)=3+0.804=3.804. sqrt(3.804)=1.95. d=10/1.95≈5.13.

Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d= a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) (1 - cos alpha) )

Which for (111) gives:

3 +6*(1 -0.866)=3 +6*0.134=3+0.804=3.804. d=10/sqrt(3.804)=10/1.95≈5.13.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the interplanar distance is the same as the edge length times something. But I'm stuck.

In conclusion, after trying multiple formulas and none giving an answer matching the options, I'm forced to make an educated guess. The closest I can get is when I take the denominator as sqrt(3 +6 *0.866)=sqrt(8.196)=2.864 → d=10/2.864≈3.49. But none of the options match. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct formula is different.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula and it's:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

But then for (111), this is negative. So perhaps the correct answer is that the plane is not possible, but the options suggest otherwise.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the denominator as (h² +k² +l²) multiplied by (1 - cos alpha).

Wait, but I'm not making progress. I think the correct answer is option B)8.95 Angstroms, but I can't see how to get there.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the interplanar distance for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal with an interatomic distance \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \) and angles \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \). The interplanar distance \( d_{hkl} \) is given by the formula:

\[
d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 - 2(hk \cos \alpha + hl \cos \alpha + kl \cos \alpha)}}
\]

For the (111) plane, \( h = k = l = 1 \), and substituting the given values:

1. Compute the denominator:
   \[
   h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3
   \]
   \[
   2(hk \cos \alpha + hl \cos \alpha + kl \cos \alpha) = 6 \cos 30^\circ
   \]
   \[
   \cos 30^\circ \approx 0.866 \implies 6 \cos 30^\circ \approx 5.196
   \]
   \[
   \text{Denominator} = 3 - 5.196 = -2.196
   \]

2. The negative result for the denominator suggests an issue with the formula or the interpretation of the angles. Taking the absolute value of the denominator, the calculation proceeds as:
   \[
   d_{hkl} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{|-2.196|}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{2.196}} \approx \frac{10}{1.48} \approx 6.75 \, \text{Å}
   \]

However, this result does not match any of the provided options. Repeated attempts to adjust the formula or interpret the angles differently (e.g., using \( 180^\circ - 30^\circ = 150^\circ \)) also yield results inconsistent with the options.

Given the options provided (\( 9.08 \, \text{Å}, 8.95 \, \text{Å}, 9.54 \, \text{Å}, 10.05 \, \text{Å} \)), the closest plausible answer, based on the reasoning and calculations, is **B) 8.95 Å**. This choice aligns most closely with the expected range of interplanar distances for the given parameters.

Answer: B
