Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's read it again.

The question is about two reactions involving (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then the products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: standard (achiral) and chiral. The question is about how many peaks each chromatogram will show.

Hmm, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially for epoxidation. Epoxidation of alkenes. Right, when an alkene reacts with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide. But the stereochemistry depends on the starting alkene's configuration.

Wait, and then after epoxidation, there's aqueous acid. Oh, right! That's the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. Epoxides under acidic conditions typically undergo ring-opening via a protonation mechanism. The ring opens with the addition of water (or another nucleophile), leading to diols.

So let's break down each reaction.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene reacts with mCPBA. Because E-geometry, the substituents on either side of the double bond are opposite each other. When mCPBA adds, it forms an epoxide. The configuration of the epoxide would depend on the starting alkene's geometry. For an E-alkene, the epoxide would form such that the oxygen atoms are on the same side if the addition is concerted. Wait, no, mCPBA adds across the double bond in a way that forms an epoxide with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene. Or wait, I think mCPBA adds in a trans fashion. Let me think: mCPBA is a peracid, and the addition is via an electrocyclic opening of the peracid's O-O bond, leading to the epoxide. For an E-alkene, the addition would result in a trans epoxide. Wait, no. Wait, mCPBA adds across the double bond to form an epoxide. The original geometry of the double bond determines the epoxide's stereochemistry.

For (E)-oct-4-ene, the double bond is trans. The epoxidation would lead to a trans epoxide. So the two oxygen atoms are on opposite sides of the former double bond.

Then, when treated with aqueous acid, the epoxide ring opens. In acidic conditions, the epoxide oxygen is protonated, making it a better leaving group. The ring opens with water attacking the more substituted carbon (since it's more stabilized). Wait, no, in acid-catalyzed ring opening, the nucleophile (water) attacks the more substituted oxygen because the carbocation is more stable there. Or, no, wait, epoxide ring opening under acidic conditions: the proton adds to one oxygen, which becomes a better leaving group. The nucleophile (water) attacks the adjacent carbon, leading to the formation of a carbocation (or possibly a conjugated base, but in acid it's more about carbocation).

Wait, for an epoxide like the one from (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a trans epoxide. So the molecule would be (E)-4,5-epoxyoctane, I think. When this epoxide opens under acid, the attack can be either from the same face or the opposite face. Wait, the attack is typically from the side opposite to the protonated oxygen. So, the protonated oxygen is on one side, so the water attacks the adjacent carbon from the opposite side, leading to ring opening.

But wait, let's think about the structure. The epoxide is from (E)-oct-4-ene, so the two carbonyls are on opposite sides. So the epoxide would have the oxygen across the ring. In the case of acid-catalyzed ring opening, the proton adds to one oxygen, making it a better leaving group. Then, the attack by water would occur on the adjacent carbon, but the attack's stereochemistry... Hmm, this might get complicated. Alternatively, I remember that in acid-catalyzed ring opening of epoxides, the resulting diol can have a certain stereochemistry based on the starting epoxide.

Wait, perhaps the acid-catalyzed ring opening can lead to either a diastereomer or a racemic mixture, depending on the starting material. Wait, no, when the starting epoxide is symmetric, the ring opening could lead to a single product. But in our case, the epoxide from (E)-oct-4-ene is not symmetric. Let me think about the structure. (E)-oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3? No wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3? Hmm, no, wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3. Wait, no, that's not right. Oct-4-ene has double bond between C4 and C5. So structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, it's CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, that can't be. No, let me get the structure right. Octene is C8H16. So oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, more accurately, it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3? No, no. Maybe it's CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps it's CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3. Wait, maybe I should count the carbons. Oct-4-ene has 8 carbons. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3, but with a double bond between C4 and C5.

Wait, perhaps it's:

1      2      3      4      5      6      7      8
CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3

Wait, no, that's 8 carbons, but the double bond is between C4 and C5. So structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3? No, that can't be. Wait, maybe it's:

CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with double bond between C4 and C5.

So, for (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on C4 and C5 are CH2CH2CH2CH3 and CH2CH2CH3 on each end? Wait, no, maybe it's CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3? No, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3, but I might be getting mixed up. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the reaction's stereochemistry without getting bogged down in the structure.

So, when (E)-oct-4-ene reacts with mCPBA, the epoxide formed is a trans epoxide. Then, when acid is added, the epoxide ring opens. The ring opening under acidic conditions would proceed with the attack of water on the more substituted carbon because of carbocation stability. But wait, for oct-4-ene, the epoxide would be on C4 and C5. So each carbon is attached to two CH2 groups and the two CH2CH2 groups. Wait, perhaps each of the two carbons in the epoxide is attached to two CH2 groups on one side and two CH2CH2 on the other. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, each carbon in the epoxide is attached to a CH2CH2 group and a CH2CH2CH3 group. Maybe it's a symmetric epoxide? Wait, no, because if the original alkene is (E), the substituents on either side are opposite.

Wait, regardless, when the epoxide opens, we'll get a diol. The key here is to determine if the diol from each epoxide is a single compound or a mixture of stereoisomers.

Wait, for Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → epoxide (trans) → acid-catalyzed ring opening → diol.

Similarly, Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → epoxide (cis) → acid-catalyzed ring opening → diol.

Now, the question is about the products from both reactions.

But wait, the first step is epoxidation. The second step is ring-opening to form diols.

So, for each reaction, what product is formed?

Let's think about the (E) isomer first.

Epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene gives a trans epoxide. Then, when treated with acid, the ring opens. The attack of water occurs in a way that depends on the stereochemistry of the epoxide.

In an acid-catalyzed ring opening, the nucleophile (water) attacks the more substituted carbon from the opposite side of the leaving group (the protonated oxygen). This leads to the formation of a diol with a specific stereochemistry.

Wait, but in a trans epoxide, the two oxygen atoms are on opposite sides. So, when the proton adds to one oxygen, making it a better leaving group, the adjacent carbon (more substituted) is where the attack occurs. The attack is from the opposite face, leading to the diol's stereochemistry.

So, for the (E)-epoxide (trans), the ring opening under acid conditions would lead to a diol with a certain configuration. Similarly, the (Z)-epoxide (cis) would open in a way that leads to a different diol configuration.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the actual products.

Another approach: the epoxide from (E)-oct-4-ene is a trans epoxide. Upon acid treatment, the ring opens to form a diol. But the diol's configuration depends on the epoxide's configuration.

But for each case, whether the diol is a single diastereomer or a racemic mixture.

Wait, if the epoxide is symmetric, the ring opening would produce a single diol. But if the epoxide is asymmetric, the ring opening could lead to either a single diastereomer or a mixture.

Wait, the (E)-epoxide is from (E)-oct-4-ene, which is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, perhaps I should think of it as (E)-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps both (E) and (Z) epoxides are not symmetric, leading to different diol products.

Wait, for (Z)-oct-4-ene: when mCPBA adds, the epoxide is cis. So the two oxygen atoms are on the same side. Then, under acid conditions, the attack of water could lead to either the same or opposite configurations in the diol.

But wait, for each epoxide, the ring-opening under acid conditions leads to a diol with specific stereochemistry. So, for each reaction, the diol may be a single compound or a pair of enantiomers.

Wait, but if the epoxide is not symmetric, then the diol could be a single diastereomer, or perhaps a pair of enantiomers.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces a pair of enantiomers, but wait, no, because the epoxide is either cis or trans, and the ring opening could lead to a specific configuration.

Wait, maybe the diol from (E)-epoxide is a single enantiomer, and the diol from (Z)-epoxide is a different single enantiomer. Or perhaps each reaction leads to a diastereomeric diol.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the possible products. For an epoxide, when you protonate and open in acid, you get a diol with a particular stereochemistry. For a trans epoxide, the diol would have adjacent hydroxyl groups on opposite sides (trans diol?), and for a cis epoxide, the hydroxyls would be on the same side (cis diol?).

Wait, that might not be correct. Because the ring opening involves the attack from the opposite side, which depends on the epoxide's geometry.

Let me think about the (E)-epoxide. The epoxide is trans. So the two oxygen atoms are on opposite sides. When protonated, one oxygen becomes a better leaving group. The water attacks the adjacent carbon from the opposite face of the leaving group. So the diol's configuration would have the two hydroxyl groups on opposite sides of the former epoxide ring.

Wait, but if the epoxide is trans, the attack would lead to the diol's hydroxyls being on the same side? Or opposite?

Alternatively, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for an example. Let's imagine trans-stilbene epoxide. When you treat that with acid, you get a diol. The trans epoxide upon ring opening would lead to a trans-diol, but maybe with a specific configuration.

Wait, no, wait. Let's take a specific example. If you have a trans epoxide, like in 2,3-epoxybutane (trans), and you open it under acidic conditions. The epoxide is formed from a trans diene. The acid treatment would protonate one oxygen. Water would attack the adjacent carbon from the opposite side, leading to the formation of a diol where the two hydroxyls are on opposite sides of the ring. So the diol would be trans.

Wait, but in that case, the diol would have the two hydroxyl groups on the same side as each other because the attack is from the opposite side of the leaving group. Hmm, perhaps not. Let me think again.

Imagine the epoxide as O-C-C-O, with the two O's on opposite sides (trans). One O is protonated. The water attacks the adjacent carbon from the opposite side of the protonated O. So, for the left O (protonated), the right C is attacked from the bottom. So, the diol would have the hydroxyls on the same side (cis) or opposite?

Wait, perhaps the diol's configuration ends up being a trans diol because the attack occurs from opposite sides.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the (E) and (Z) epoxides.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → trans epoxide → ring opens to form a diol. Let's say this diol is a single stereoisomer.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → cis epoxide → ring opens to form another diol, which might be a different stereoisomer.

Wait, but wait, each epoxide can lead to two possible diastereomers when opening? Or perhaps each leads to a single diastereomer.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction yields a single diastereomer, but those diastereomers are enantiomers of each other. Or perhaps they're different diastereomers.

Wait, let's think of the structures. For (E)-epoxide, the ring opening leads to a diol where the two hydroxyl groups are on opposite sides (trans). For (Z)-epoxide, the diol's hydroxyls are on the same side (cis). So each reaction produces a single diol with a specific configuration.

Wait, but if each reaction produces a single diol, then when you combine the products, you have two diastereomers? Because each diol is different.

Wait, no, because each diol from (E) and (Z) might be enantiomers or diastereomers.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol from the (E) epoxide isn't the same as from the (Z) epoxide. So when you combine both reactions' products, perhaps you have two different diastereomers.

But then, considering the HPLC columns. The standard column is achiral, so it can't differentiate enantiomers, but can separate diastereomers (if they have different physical properties). The chiral column can separate enantiomers.

Wait, but if the diols from each reaction are enantiomers, then the achiral column would show them as one peak, while the chiral column would show two peaks. Alternatively, if they're diastereomers, the achiral column would show two peaks, and the chiral column would also show two peaks (since diastereomers are not mirror images, and a chiral column can separate them if they have different interactions).

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me structure it.

Each reaction yields a diol.

Reaction 1: (E)-epoxide → diol A.

Reaction 2: (Z)-epoxide → diol B.

Are diol A and diol B enantiomers or diastereomers?

Wait, if the diols are enantiomers, then in the standard HPLC (achiral), they would co-elute (one peak), but in chiral HPLC, they would split into two peaks. But if diols A and B are diastereomers, then in the standard HPLC, they would show as two separate peaks, and in the chiral column, also two peaks, because diastereomers are not mirror images and have different interactions with the chiral stationary phase.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about the diols. The diol from (E)-epoxide and from (Z)-epoxide. Let's imagine that each produces a diol with the same connectivity but different configurations.

Wait, for example, diol A is (2R,3R), and diol B is (2S,3S). Then, they would be enantiomers. Alternatively, if diol A is (2R,3S) and diol B is (2R,3R), then they are diastereomers.

Hmm, but I think that's not the case. Let me think about the reaction mechanism.

When the epoxide ring opens, the configuration of the diol depends on the attack direction. For the (E)-epoxide, which is trans, the attack leads to a certain configuration. For the (Z)-epoxide, which is cis, the attack leads to a different configuration.

Wait, let's model it. Imagine a trans epoxide: the two epoxide oxygens are on opposite sides. When the acid protonates one oxygen, the adjacent carbon becomes positively charged, and water attacks from the opposite side. So the diol's configuration would have the hydroxyl groups on opposite sides? Or same?

Alternatively, perhaps each diol has two stereogenic centers, and their configurations depend on the starting epoxide.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck on the actual configurations. Maybe I should consider the number of stereoisomers each reaction produces.

Each epoxide is a cyclic ether with two chiral centers. So when it opens, two new chiral centers (the diol) are formed.

Wait, no. Let's think. The epoxide has two adjacent chiral centers. When the epoxide ring opens, each oxygen is connected to two carbons, which become the diol's two hydroxyl-bearing carbons. So each of these carbons becomes a chiral center.

Wait, but in the case of (E)-oct-4-ene's epoxide, the two carbons in the epoxide are each connected to two different groups. For example, each is connected to a CH2CH2 group and a CH2CH2CH3 group or something like that. So, each of those carbons has four different substituents: so they are chiral centers.

When the epoxide opens, each of those carbons (now diol carbons) will have a hydroxyl group, and their configurations will depend on the attack direction.

Wait, for (E)-epoxide, when the proton adds to one oxygen, the adjacent carbon is attacked by water from the opposite face, so the configuration of that carbon would change.

But this is getting a bit too detailed. Let me think about the overall outcome.

Each reaction produces a diol with two stereogenic centers. The diol from (E)-epoxide and the diol from (Z)-epoxide are different compounds. Now, are these diols enantiomers or diastereomers?

Wait, consider that (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are geometric isomers. Their epoxides are also geometric isomers. The ring opening would lead to diols that are diastereomers, not enantiomers. Because the starting alkenes are geometric isomers, their epoxides and subsequent diols would be diastereomers.

Alternatively, perhaps each diol is a single enantiomer, and when you combine both reactions' products, you get two different diastereomers.

Wait, but if each diol has two stereocenters, how many stereoisomers are possible?

Each diol can have four possible stereoisomers (2^2). But if the two stereocenters are not independent (i.e., the molecule has a plane of symmetry), the number may be less.

Wait, for oct-4-ene, the epoxide is between C4 and C5. So the diol is on C4 and C5. Each of those carbons is connected to two CH2 groups and two longer chains.

Wait, maybe the diol is meso. For example, if the diol has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral despite having stereocenters. For example, 2,3-butanediol is a meso compound, which is achiral.

So, in our case, the diol from (E)-oct-4-ene could be a meso compound, making it achiral. Similarly, the diol from (Z)-oct-4-ene could be a meso compound as well. Or perhaps each leads to a non-meso diol, which is chiral.

Wait, that's a crucial point. If the diol is meso, it's achiral, so it would elute as a single peak on both HPLC columns. If it's chiral, then the achiral column would show one peak, but the chiral column would show two peaks (enantiomers), unless it's a racemic mixture.

But wait, in the case of the ring-opening of an epoxide under acidic conditions, does it lead to a racemic mixture or a single enantiomer?

Ah, in acid-catalyzed ring opening of an asymmetric epoxide, the diol formed can be a racemic mixture if the epoxide is symmetric. But if the epoxide is asymmetric, the ring opening can lead to a single diastereomer.

Wait, but the (E) and (Z) epoxides are not symmetric. So their ring-opening in acid would yield diols with specific stereochemistry, but are they single enantiomers or diastereomers?

Wait, perhaps the ring-opening of the (E) and (Z) epoxides leads to two different diastereomers, each of which is a single enantiomer. So when you combine them, you have two distinct diastereomers.

Alternatively, perhaps each epoxide leads to a pair of enantiomers, but I don't think so because the attack is not random but directed, leading to a specific configuration.

Wait, perhaps each diol is a single stereoisomer (not a racemic mix) because the reaction is stereospecific.

So, going back, if reaction 1 produces diol A (single enantiomer), and reaction 2 produces diol B (another single enantiomer), which is either enantiomeric or diastereomeric to diol A.

If diol A and diol B are enantiomers, then on the achiral column, they would appear as one peak (because they're mirror images and have the same physical properties). On the chiral column, they would split into two peaks.

But if diol A and diol B are diastereomers, then on the achiral column, they would appear as two peaks, and on the chiral column, also as two peaks.

Wait, but I think that the diols from (E) and (Z) epoxides are diastereomers because they have different configurations. For example, one may be (2R,3R) and the other (2S,3S), but that's if they're enantiomers. Alternatively, if they're (2R,3S) and (2S,3R), which are enantiomers.

Wait, maybe I need to draw this.

Let me imagine the structure of the diol from (E)-epoxide. Let's say the two hydroxyls are on opposite sides (trans), so the configurations are R and S on adjacent carbons. Wait, but that would depend on the actual structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the diols are enantiomers. So when you combine both, you have two enantiomers, which would show as one peak on achiral HPLC, and two peaks on chiral HPLC.

But wait, wait. Each reaction produces only one enantiomer. So reaction 1 produces enantiomer A, reaction 2 produces enantiomer B, which is the enantiomer of A. So when you combine them, you have a racemic mixture of A and B.

So in the standard HPLC (achiral), the racemic mixture would appear as a single peak because the two enantiomers are not separated. On the chiral column, they would split into two peaks.

But that would lead to the standard HPLC showing one peak and chiral showing two. But looking at the options, the options don't have that scenario. The options are:

Option C: 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC.

Option D: 3 peaks in standard, 4 in chiral.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces two stereoisomers, and combining them leads to more peaks.

Wait, perhaps each reaction produces two diastereomers. For example, reaction 1: (E)-epoxide → diol A and diol B. But that seems unlikely because the reaction is stereospecific, leading to a single product.

Wait, no. If each epoxide leads to a diol with two stereocenters, but the diol is a meso compound (achiral), then each reaction would produce a single compound. So, combining both would give two different meso diols, which are enantiomers or diastereomers.

Wait, if the diol from (E)-epoxide is a meso compound, then it's achiral. Similarly, the diol from (Z)-epoxide might also be a meso compound, but perhaps a different one.

Wait, but (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are different starting materials. So their diols would be different compounds. If each is a meso compound, then each would be achiral. So when you combine both, you have two different achiral diols. On the standard HPLC (achiral), each would have a separate peak. On the chiral HPLC, since they're achiral, each would still be a single peak. So the total would be two peaks on both columns.

But wait, if the diols are achiral, then both HPLCs would show two peaks. Which would correspond to option C: 2 peaks in both.

But wait, I'm getting confused. Are the diols from each reaction achiral?

If the diol has two stereocenters and is a meso compound, it's achiral. Let's say the diol from (E)-epoxide is a meso compound, and the diol from (Z)-epoxide is another meso compound. Then, each would be a single achiral compound. So when you mix them, you have two different compounds, each of which is achiral. So in the standard HPLC, each would have a separate peak, so two peaks total. On the chiral HPLC, since each is achiral, they would each elute as a single peak (since chiral columns can't separate achiral compounds). So the chiral HPLC would show two peaks as well.

So the expected chromatograms would have 2 peaks in both columns. That would correspond to option C.

But wait, is that correct?

Alternatively, perhaps the diols are not meso compounds but are chiral. Then, each reaction would produce two enantiomers, but since the reaction is 100% efficient and stereospecific, each would produce a single enantiomer.

In that case, combining both would give two enantiomers (each from a different reaction), which would be a racemic mixture. So on standard HPLC, they would appear as a single peak. On chiral HPLC, they would split into two peaks.

But that's not an option in the question. Because the options don't have that scenario.

Wait, perhaps each reaction actually produces two diastereomers, leading to more peaks.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces one diastereomer, but when both are combined, you have two diastereomers, which are not enantiomers. So in the standard HPLC, they would be two separate peaks (achiral can separate diastereomers). On the chiral HPLC, they would also be two separate peaks, because diastereomers have different interactions with the chiral stationary phase.

In that case, the standard HPLC would show two peaks, and the chiral HPLC would also show two peaks. So option C.

Wait, but looking at the options again: option C is 2 peaks in both.

But another possibility is that each reaction produces two stereoisomers. For example, each reaction leads to a diol that is a pair of enantiomers. But that can't be because the reaction is stereospecific and goes to 100% completion. So each reaction would produce a single enantiomer.

Wait, perhaps each reaction leads to the formation of two diastereomers, but that would require the diol to have more than two stereocenters. Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps each diol is actually a pair of enantiomers, but in reality, each reaction produces a single enantiomer. So when you combine both reactions, you have two enantiomers (from each reaction), making a racemic mixture. But that doesn't fit any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces two stereoisomers, which are diastereomers, leading to four stereoisomers in total when you combine both. But that's probably not the case.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the diol structure. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the diol formed from acid-catalyzed ring opening would have the hydroxyl groups on opposite sides (trans), making it a diastereomer of the diol formed from (Z)-oct-4-ene, which would have the hydroxyls on the same side (cis). So each reaction produces a single diastereomer, leading to two diastereomers when combined.

In that case, the standard HPLC (achiral) would see two separate peaks (since they're different diastereomers). The chiral HPLC would also see two peaks because diastereomers are not mirror images and have different retention times on a chiral column.

So the standard and chiral HPLCs would each show two peaks, which is option C.

But wait, another possibility: each reaction produces two stereoisomers. For example, each diol exists as two enantiomers, and in each reaction, you get both enantiomers. So when you combine both reactions, you have four stereoisomers. But that seems unlikely because each reaction is stereospecific and would produce a single enantiomer. So each reaction would produce only one enantiomer, and combining them would give two enantiomers (a racemic mixture if they are pairs).

Wait, but let's say each reaction produces one enantiomer, then combining both would give two enantiomers. On the achiral column, they would merge into one peak; on the chiral column, two peaks. But the options don't have that scenario.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to approach it from another angle.

Each reaction produces a diol. Each diol has two stereocenters. The question is whether these diols are enantiomers, diastereomers, or the same.

If (E)-epoxide and (Z)-epoxide lead to diols that are enantiomers, then combining them would give a racemic mixture, which on standard HPLC would be one peak, and on chiral HPLC, two peaks.

But if the diols are diastereomers, then combining them would result in two separate diastereomers, which would show as two peaks on both HPLCs.

But the correct answer likely depends on whether the diols are enantiomers or diastereomers.

Wait, let's think about the diastereomer part. (E) and (Z) alkenes are geometric isomers. Their epoxides are also geometric isomers. The ring-opening of each would give diols that are diastereomers, not enantiomers.

So when you combine the products of both reactions, you have two different diastereomers. Therefore, both the standard and chiral HPLCs would show two peaks each.

So the correct answer is option C: 2 peaks in both.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves two reactions where (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid, and the products are analyzed using standard (achiral) and chiral HPLC columns. The key steps and reasoning are as follows:

1. **Reaction Overview**:  
   - mCPBA is a peracid that reacts with alkenes to form epoxides. The stereochemistry of the epoxide depends on the geometry of the starting alkene.  
   - (E)-oct-4-ene forms a trans epoxide, while (Z)-oct-4-ene forms a cis epoxide.  
   - Under acidic conditions, the epoxide undergoes ring-opening to form a diol. The stereochemistry of the diol depends on the configuration of the epoxide.

2. **Ring-Opening Mechanism**:  
   - In acidic conditions, the epoxide oxygen is protonated, making it a better leaving group. Water attacks the more substituted carbon of the epoxide, leading to a carbocation intermediate.  
   - The stereochemistry of the diol is determined by the attack direction of water, which depends on the geometry of the starting epoxide.  

3. **Products of Each Reaction**:  
   - Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → trans epoxide → diol with hydroxyl groups on opposite sides (trans-diol).  
   - Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → cis epoxide → diol with hydroxyl groups on the same side (cis-diol).  
   - Each reaction produces a single stereoisomer of the diol due to the stereospecific nature of the reaction.

4. **Combining the Products**:  
   - The diols formed from (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are diastereomers, not enantiomers, because they have different configurations at the stereogenic centers.  
   - When combined, the mixture contains two distinct diastereomers.

5. **HPLC Analysis**:  
   - **Standard (Achiral) HPLC**: Diastereomers have different physical properties and will elute as separate peaks. Thus, two peaks are observed.  
   - **Chiral HPLC**: Diastereomers are not mirror images and interact differently with the chiral stationary phase. Therefore, two peaks are also observed.

6. **Conclusion**:  
   - Both the standard and chiral HPLC columns will show two peaks, corresponding to the two diastereomeric diols.
