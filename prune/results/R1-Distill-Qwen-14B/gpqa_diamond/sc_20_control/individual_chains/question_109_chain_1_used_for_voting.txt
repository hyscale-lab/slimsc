Okay, let me try to work through this problem. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it step by step.

So the question is about two nucleons (like protons or neutrons) in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X. The initial state is 1S0, which I think means that the total spin S is 0, the orbital angular momentum L is 0 (since S=0 and it's S state), and the total angular momentum J is 0. Wait, actually, the term symbol is given as (2S+1)L(J), so 1S0 would be S=0, L=0, J=0. Because 2S+1 is 1, so 1S0 implies S=0, L=0, J=0.

The system emits a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. So I need to consider what that means for the parity of the entire system. Parity conservation in strong interactions (which I think this is assuming since it's about emitting a pion or similar) would require that the initial and final states have the same parity. Or wait, no, because the emission of a particle with intrinsic parity would flip the parity relative to the initial, unless the orbital angular momentum contributes. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of parity conservation.

Wait, the problem says to consider conservation of angular momentum and parity. So the parity of the initial state should equal the product of the parity of the final states and the parity of the emitted particle, considering the orbital angular momentum between them.

The initial state is two nucleons in 1S0. The parity of a state is given by (-1)^L, since parity is (-1)^L for orbital angular momentum. So for 1S0, L=0, so parity is (-1)^0 = +1.

When the two nucleons emit a particle X, the final state will consist of the two nucleons in some state and the emitted X. Let's denote the state of the two nucleons as T(NN), L(NN), S(NN), and the emitted particle X has orbital angular momentum l with respect to the NN system.

Wait, the total parity after emission should be the product of the parity of the NN state and the parity of the emitted particle X, multiplied by (-1)^l, where l is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of the emitted particle. Because when a particle is emitted with orbital angular momentum l, the parity changes by (-1)^l. So the parity of the whole system is the product of the initial parity, the parity of X, and (-1)^l.

Wait, but the initial parity is +1. The emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1. So the parity of the final state must be (parity of NN state) * (parity of X) * (-1)^l. But since the process conserves parity, the initial parity (1) must equal the final parity. So:

1 = [parity(NN_final)] * [parity(X)] * (-1)^l.

Wait, but parity isn't conserved in weak interactions, but I think the problem is assuming strong interaction, so parity is conserved. So that equation should hold.

But I'm not entirely sure if the parity conservation is for the entire system. Because when you have a decay, the initial state's parity equals the final state's parity. The final state includes the two nucleons and the emitted particle. But each part's parity contributes. So the total parity is (parity of NN) * (parity of X) * (-1)^l, where l is the orbital angular momentum of X relative to the NN system.

Wait, maybe I should think of it as the parity of the two-body system (NN) and the emitted particle X. Let me structure it:

The initial parity is P_initial = (-1)^L_initial, where L_initial is 0 for 1S0. So P_initial=1.

The final parity is P_final = P_NN_final * P_X * (-1)^l, where l is the orbital angular momentum of X. Because when a particle is emitted with orbital angular momentum l, it contributes a parity factor of (-1)^l.

Since parity is conserved, P_initial = P_final. So,

1 = P_NN_final * (-1) * (-1)^l.

Because X has parity -1. So:

1 = P_NN_final * (-1)^{l+1}.

Wait, that can be rewritten as P_NN_final = (-1)^{l}.

Because 1 = (-1)^{l+1} * P_NN_final → P_NN_final = (-1)^{l+1}.

So the parity of the NN final state is (-1)^{l+1}.

But wait, what is the parity of the NN state? The parity of the two-nucleon system comes from their orbital angular momentum. Since for two nucleons, their state has orbital angular momentum L_NN, so parity is (-1)^{L_NN}.

So we have:

(-1)^{L_NN} = (-1)^{l+1}.

Which implies that L_NN = l + 1 mod 2.

Because (-1)^a = (-1)^b → a ≡ b mod 2.

So L_NN ≡ l +1 mod 2.

But wait, let me make sure. Let me write:

(-1)^{L_NN} = (-1)^{l+1} → L_NN ≡ l +1 mod 2.

So L_NN - (l +1) is even → L_NN - l = 1 mod 2 → L_NN + l = 1 mod 2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier step. Let's go back.

We have:

P_NN_final = (-1)^{l+1}.

But P_NN_final is (-1)^{L_NN}.

So (-1)^{L_NN} = (-1)^{l + 1}.

Which implies L_NN = l + 1 mod 2.

So L_NN and l must differ by 1 mod 2.

So L_NN = l + 1 mod 2.

Meaning L_NN and l have opposite parity.

So for example, if l is even, L_NN is odd, and vice versa.

So that's one condition.

Now, the problem also states that Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2.

Wait, the question says: "Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)."

Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about that equation, but let's take it as given.

Wait, I think that's a condition arising from the Pauli exclusion principle. For identical particles, their total wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange. The wavefunction includes spin, isospin, and spatial parts. So the product of these must be antisymmetric.

But I'm not exactly sure how that leads to T = S + L +1 mod 2. Maybe another approach is needed.

Wait, perhaps it's about the overall wavefunction symmetry. Since the nucleons are fermions (protons and neutrons are fermions), their total wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange.

The total wavefunction is a product of spatial, spin, and isospin parts. So the product must have a symmetry of (-1) under exchange, which is (-1)^{L} for spatial, (-1)^S for spin, and (-1)^T for isospin. So each part contributes a factor, and their product must be -1.

So the product of these factors should be -1.

So for the spatial part: exchange symmetry is (-1)^L.

Spin part: (-1)^S.

Isospin part: (-1)^T.

So the product is (-1)^{L + S + T}.

This product must be equal to -1, which is (-1)^1.

So,

(-1)^{L + S + T} = (-1)^1 → L + S + T ≡ 1 mod 2.

Which implies that L + S + T = 1 mod 2.

Wait, but the problem states that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2.

Wait, that would be T = S + L +1 mod 2 → T + S + L = 1 mod 2.

Which matches the condition we just derived. So that's correct.

So the condition is T + S + L = 1 mod 2. Or T = S + L +1 mod 2.

Now, the final NN state has T(NN) = 0.

So T=0 → 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L = 1 mod 2.

So S + L must be 1 mod 2.

Meaning S and L have opposite parity.

So, S = L +1 mod 2.

So now, let's look at each option and see which one doesn't satisfy these conditions.

Each option gives the initial state and the decay products.

The initial state is 1S0, which is S=0, L=0, J=0.

The options are:

Option A) 1S0 → 7D1 + p

Option B) 1S0 → 3S1 + p

Option C) 1S0 → 3D3 + f

Option D) 1S0 → 3P0 + s

Wait, the emitted particle is denoted by the lowercase letter after the numbers. So in option A, the emitted particle is p (probably a π⁺ or π⁻?), which has spin 0 and parity -1. Similarly, f is a pion with higher orbital angular momentum? Wait, no, the lowercase letters denote the angular momentum state of X. Wait, the question says, "the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X." Wait, that might not be right. Let me re-read the problem.

Wait the note says: "the term symbol (e.g. 1S0) is in general defined (2S+1)L(J), where S is the total spin, L the total orbital angular momentum written in spectroscopic notation, and J the total angular momentum."

Wait, but the options have terms like 7D1, which would be (2S+1)L(J) = 7D1 → 2S+1=7 → S=3, L=2 (since D is L=2), J=1.

Wait, but the problem says that the lowercase letters denote the angular momentum state of X.

Wait, the options are written as 1S0 → 7D1 + p. So the part after the arrow is the final state of NN (7D1) and the emitted particle (p), which perhaps is a pion or something else.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let's parse the options correctly.

Each option's final state is given as (NN state) + (emitted particle). The NN state is given as, e.g., 7D1, which would be (2S+1)L(J) → 7D1: 2S+1=7 → S=3, L=2 (D), J=1.

The emitted particle is denoted by a letter, like p, s, f, etc. These are usually the spectroscopic notation for orbital angular momentum, but the question says the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X. So 'p' is l=1, 's' is l=0, 'd' is l=2, 'f' is l=3. Wait, no, 'p' is l=1, 's' is l=0, 'd' l=2, 'f' l=3, etc.

Wait, but in the options, the emitted particle's angular momentum is given by the lowercase letter. For example, in option A, the emitted particle is 'p', which would imply l=1.

So for each option, the emitted particle X has orbital angular momentum l equal to the letter's value. So:

p → l=1

s → l=0

f → l=3

d → l=2 (but in the options, the emitted particle uses lowercase letters, so 'p' is l=1, 'd' would be l=2, but in the options, the emitted particles are p, s, f, and in one case 'p' again.

Wait, let's look at the options again:

Option A: 7D1 + p → X is p, so l=1.

Option B: 3S1 + p → X is p, so l=1.

Option C: 3D3 + f → X is f, so l=3.

Option D: 3P0 + s → X is s, so l=0.

So for each case, the orbital angular momentum l of X is:

A) l=1

B) l=1

C) l=3

D) l=0

Now, from earlier, the condition is L_NN ≡ l +1 mod 2.

Because L_NN = l +1 mod 2.

So let's compute L_NN for each option.

For each option, the NN state is given as:

Option A: 7D1 → L_NN is D → 2.

Option B: 3S1 → L=0 (since S is L=0).

Option C: 3D3 → L=2.

Option D: 3P0 → L=1 (P is l=1).

So compute L_NN for each:

A) L_NN =2.

B) L_NN=0.

C) L_NN=2.

D) L_NN=1.

Now, from the condition L_NN ≡ l +1 mod 2.

So let's compute l+1 mod 2 for each option and see if L_NN matches.

Option A: l=1 → l+1=2 → mod 2 is 0. L_NN=2 → mod2 is 0. So 0=0: condition holds.

Option B: l=1 → l+1=2 → mod2=0. L_NN=0 → mod2=0: condition holds.

Option C: l=3 → l+1=4 → mod2=0. L_NN=2 → mod2=0: condition holds.

Option D: l=0 → l+1=1 → mod2=1. L_NN=1 → mod2=1: condition holds.

Wait, all options satisfy the parity condition. Hmm. That can't be right because the question says one is not permitted.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, earlier, the condition for parity was:

1 = [parity(NN_final)] * [parity(X)] * (-1)^l.

Parity(X) is -1.

So,

1 = [parity NN] * (-1) * (-1)^l.

Thus,

parity NN = (-1)^(l+1).

But parity NN is also (-1)^L_NN.

So,

(-1)^L_NN = (-1)^{l+1} → L_NN = l +1 mod 2.

So for each option, let's compute L_NN and l.

Option A: L=2, l=1.

L_NN=2, l=1.

2 mod2=0; l+1=2 → mod2=0. So 0=0: condition holds.

Option B: L=0, l=1.

0 mod2=0; l+1=2 → 0=0: holds.

Option C: L=2, l=3.

2 mod2=0; l+1=4 mod2=0 → holds.

Option D: L=1, l=0.

1 mod2=1; l+1=1 mod2=1 → holds.

So all options satisfy the parity condition. So maybe I'm missing another condition.

Wait, the other condition is T(NN) =0, and T + S + L =1 mod2.

So for each final NN state, we have T=0. So S + L ≡1 mod2.

So let's compute S and L for each NN state and check if S + L ≡1 mod2.

Each option's NN state is given as (2S+1)LJ. So:

Option A: 7D1 → 2S+1=7 → S=3. L=2 (D), J=1.

So S=3, L=2.

S + L =3 +2=5 → mod2=1. So condition holds (0 = S+L +1 mod2 → 0=5+1 mod2 → 6 mod2=0 → yes, 0=0).

Option B: 3S1 → 2S+1=3 → S=1. L=0 (S).

S=1, L=0 → S+L=1 → mod2=1 → condition holds.

Option C: 3D3 → S=1 (since 2S+1=3 → S=1). L=2 (D).

S+L=1+2=3 → mod2=1 → condition holds.

Option D: 3P0 → S=1, L=1 (P).

S+L=1+1=2 → mod2=0. But condition requires mod2=1. Oh, that's a problem.

Wait, condition is S + L ≡1 mod2. Because T=0 → 0 = S + L +1 mod2 → S + L = 1 mod2.

So for option D: S=1, L=1 → S+L=2 → mod2=0 ≠1. So condition not met. So option D would be impossible.

Wait, but earlier when I checked the parity condition, option D met it. So the issue is that option D doesn't satisfy the Pauli condition.

Wait, let me double-check.

Option D: 3P0 + s.

The NN state is 3P0 → which is (2S+1) L J → 3P0 → S=1, L=1, J=0.

So S=1, L=1.

So S + L =2 → mod2=0.

So T=0 → 0 = S + L +1 mod2 → 0=2+1=3 mod2=1. But 0≠1. So this condition is violated.

Therefore, option D is not allowed.

Wait, but let me go back to the initial condition.

The problem states that the emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1. So what about the spin of X? Does that affect anything else?

The emitted particle X has spin, which affects the overall spin of the system. But in the problem, I think we're only concerned with parity and angular momentum, and the Pauli condition involving isospin, spin, and angular momentum.

Wait, but perhaps in the case of the emitted particle, its spin also contributes to the overall spin of the system, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the Pauli condition is about the final NN state, not including the emitted particle. Because the equation is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2.

So the emitted particle's spin doesn't directly affect the NN state's spin. So perhaps the earlier condition is sufficient.

So the only option that violates the condition is option D, because S + L =2 mod2=0, which doesn't meet the required 1 mod2.

Therefore, option D is not permitted.

Wait, but let's check the other options again to be sure.

Option A: S=3, L=2. 3+2=5 mod2=1 → condition holds.

Option B: S=1, L=0 → 1+0=1 mod2=1 → condition holds.

Option C: S=1, L=2 →1+2=3 mod2=1 → condition holds.

So all options except D satisfy the conditions. Therefore, option D is not permitted.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which partial wave is not permitted, we analyze the conditions provided in the problem. The initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in the 1S0 state, which corresponds to \( S = 0 \), \( L = 0 \), and \( J = 0 \). The system emits a particle \( X \) with intrinsic parity \( -1 \). Conservation of parity and the Pauli exclusion principle impose constraints on the final NN state.

### Key Conditions:
1. **Parity Conservation**:  
   The parity of the initial state is \( (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1 \). After emission, the parity of the final state is given by:  
   \[
   P_{\text{final}} = P_{\text{NN}} \cdot P_X \cdot (-1)^l
   \]  
   where \( P_X = -1 \) (intrinsic parity of \( X \)) and \( l \) is the orbital angular momentum of \( X \). Since parity is conserved, \( P_{\text{initial}} = P_{\text{final}} \), leading to:  
   \[
   (-1)^{L_{\text{NN}}} = (-1)^{l + 1}.
   \]  
   This implies \( L_{\text{NN}} \equiv l + 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \).

2. **Pauli Exclusion Principle**:  
   For identical fermions, the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. This requires:  
   \[
   T_{\text{NN}} = S_{\text{NN}} + L_{\text{NN}} + 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2).
   \]  
   Given \( T_{\text{NN}} = 0 \), the condition simplifies to:  
   \[
   S_{\text{NN}} + L_{\text{NN}} \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2).
   \]

### Conclusion:
Option D violates the Pauli exclusion principle condition \( S_{\text{NN}} + L_{\text{NN}} \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \). Therefore, it is not permitted.
