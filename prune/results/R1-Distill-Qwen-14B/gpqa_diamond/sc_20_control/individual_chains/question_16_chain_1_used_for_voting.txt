Okay, so I have this question here about optical activity in organic compounds. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it. Optical activity means the compound has chiral centers, right? Or maybe it's about the molecule not having a plane of symmetry or being meso.

The question lists seven compounds, and I need to figure out how many are optically active. Let me go through each one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: Wait, this is a substituted alkene. The configuration is Z. For a molecule to have optical activity, it needs to have a chiral center. Let me draw the structure. 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene has the double bond between C1 and C2. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or wait, but wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? No, wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that can't be right. Wait, but the structure is actually CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2 because but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2X. Wait, no, but 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be on the first carbon. So the structure is ClCH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene is Cl on C1, and a methyl on C2. So C1: Cl, C2: CH(CH3), and the double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, but that would be CH2Cl is C1, C2 is CH(CH3), but that's impossible because C1 is CH2Cl, C2 is CH(CH3), and the double bond is between 1 and 2. So the structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that's butene without the double bond. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's think again.

Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon, so CH2Cl-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's not considering the double bond. Oh, wait, no. 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would have the double bond between C1 and C2, and a methyl group on C2. So structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that's three substituents? Let me count the substituents on each carbon.

On C1: Cl, and two CH2 groups? No, wait, C1 is CH2Cl, and the double bond to C2. C2 has a methyl group, so structure is C1: CH2Cl, double bond to C2: CH(CH3). So the molecule is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2. Wait, how many substituents does each carbon have? For a double bond to have Z configuration, the substituents on each carbon determine the stereochemistry. But for optical activity, we need a chiral center. Let's see, is there a chiral center here?

Looking at the structure: CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2. The double bond is between C1 and C2, with C1 being CH2Cl and C2 being CH(CH3). So C1 is CH2Cl, which is two H's, Cl, and two bonds to the double bond. So it's CH2Cl on C1, which is sp2 hybridized, so no chiral center there. C2 is CH(CH3), but since it's double bonded, it's also sp2. So no chiral centers. So this compound is not chiral. So no optical activity. So this one is not active. Wait, but wait: wait, is there any possibility of a chiral center elsewhere? No, because the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2. So no chiral centers. So this compound is not active.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: Okay, this is a more complex structure. Let me parse the name. Hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione sounds like a fused ring system. Methano suggests a bridge, perhaps. The substituent is chloromethylene (Cl2C=?), which is attached at position 8. The stereochemistry is given as (3aR,7aS,E). E indicates the configuration of the double bond. Now, the question is whether this compound has a chiral center. Let's see: the molecule has six-membered rings, perhaps with substituents. The substituent is chloromethylene, which is an =CHCl group, perhaps attached in a specific way. But regardless of that, the compound has multiple stereocenters as per the (3aR,7aS) part. So these are stereocenters, meaning that the molecule has chiral centers. So it will be optically active. So this compound is active.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So 2 and 3 positions are the two CH2 groups. If both are substituted with methyl groups, then the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Wait, no: succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So 2,3-dimethyl would have methyl groups on both CH2's. So the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Now, are there any chiral centers here? Because the two CH(CH3) groups are on the 2 and 3 positions. Let me look at each carbon. The 2nd carbon: attached to HOOC, CH(CH3), and two CH2's? Wait, no. Let's think: succinic acid is four carbons, with two COOH groups on ends. The middle two are CH2 each. So when you have 2,3-dimethyl, each of those CH2 becomes CH(CH3). So each of the 2 and 3 positions is a carbon with four different groups? Let me see: on the 2nd carbon, the groups are: COOH (from the first carbon), CH(CH3) (from the 3rd), a methyl, and two CH2 groups? Wait, no. Wait, the 2nd carbon is connected to the first (which is COOH), the third (CH(CH3)), and two CH2 groups. Or wait, the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the 2 and 3 carbons has the following groups: for C2, the groups are COOH (from C1), CH(CH3) (from C3), a methyl, and a CH2 (from C3)? No, wait, perhaps each C is attached to two CH(CH3) groups. Wait, maybe I should draw it:

HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) is connected to:

C2: two CH3 groups (from the methyl), a COOH group (from C1), and a CH(CH3) (from C3). Wait, but that would be four substituents. Wait, no: each C has four bonds. C2 is bonded to:

- The C1 (which is HOOC-)
- The C3 (CH(CH3))
- Two methyl groups (from the substituent)

Wait, no, it's 2R and 3S. So each C2 and C3 have two methyl groups. Let me see: for C2, the substituents are: COOH (from C1), two methyl groups (from the dimethyl), and the CH(CH3) from C3. Wait, no, no. Wait, each of the middle carbons is CH(CH3). So for the 2nd carbon, the substituents are: the two CH(CH3) groups on either side, a methyl, and a COOH group. No, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. When you have 2,3-dimethyl, each CH2 becomes CH(CH3). So the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Now, the C2 and C3 each have a CH(CH3) group. For each, the substituents are:

- C2: attached to C1 (COOH-CH2), a methyl group, and two CH(CH3) groups? No, perhaps each C has the following groups: C2 is connected to the C1 (COOH), a methyl (from dimethyl), and two other substituents.

Wait, perhaps the actual groups on C2 are:

- One COOH (from C1)
- One methyl (from the dimethyl)
- Two CH(CH3) groups? No, that doesn't make sense because each carbon can only have four bonds.

Wait, perhaps each C2 and C3 in 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid has four substituents. C2 is attached to:

- The C1 (which is a -CH2-COOH)
- The C3 (which is a -CH(CH3)-)
- Two methyl groups.

Wait, no, because the substituents are methyl on the CH2, which becomes CH(CH3). So the structure is:

HOOC-(CH(CH3))-(CH(CH3))-COOH.

So on each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3), substituents are:

- From C2: two CH(CH3) groups, a COOH group, and a methyl.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Each middle carbon is CH(CH3), so each has:

- Two CH(CH3) groups connected to C1 and C3.
Wait, no, because each is a central carbon. Wait, perhaps for C2, the four substituents are:

- One COOH group (from C1)
- One methyl group (from the CH(CH3))
- Two CH(CH3) groups? No, that can't be right. I'm getting stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps C2 has:

- The COOH (from C1)
- The CH(CH3) (from C3)
- Two methyl groups attached to itself.

Wait, that would make four substituents: COOH, two methyl, and CH(CH3). No, that can't be because that would imply a carbon with five bonds. Hmm. Maybe it's better to approach this differently.

If the compound is (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, then each of C2 and C3 must be chiral centers. Because each has four different substituents. Let me see:

For C2:
- Group 1: COOH (from C1)
- Group 2: CH(CH3) (from C3)
- Group 3: methyl (from the dimethyl)
- Group 4: another substituent? Wait, no, the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So C2 is connected to C1 (which is a -CH(CH3)), C3 (which is a -CH(CH3)), and two methyl groups. Wait, that would make two methyl groups on C2, making it a CH2 group, which is impossible because it's supposed to be dimethyl. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps each of the 2 and 3 positions has a methyl group added to the CH2, making them each CH(CH3). So each of these carbons has four substituents: the two adjacent CH(CH3) groups, a methyl, and a hydrogen? Wait, no, because the CH(CH3) would have two methyls. No, that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps each CH2 in the original succinic acid is replaced by a CH(CH3), meaning each of the middle carbons has a methyl group attached.

So, for C2: substituents are COOH (from C1), CH(CH3) (from C3), and two CH3 groups attached to itself. Wait, that would be four substituents: COOH, CH(CH3), and two CH3. So yes, four different groups? No, because two are CH3. So in that case, C2 would have two methyl groups, making it not a chiral center. Wait, but the configuration is R and S. So perhaps there's something wrong with my analysis.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the actual structure. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. Adding a methyl group to each CH2 would make HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Now, each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) would have:

- C2: attached to C1 (COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two CH3 groups.

Wait, that's four substituents. C2 has COOH (from C1), two methyl groups, and a CH(CH3) (from C3). No, that doesn't make sense because CH(CH3) is a group, but the substituents would be:

Wait, C2 is connected to:

- The C1 (which is -CH(CH3)-COOH)
- The C3 (which is -CH(CH3)-COOH)
- Two methyl groups.

Wait, that can't be because that would be four substituents: two methyls, a CH(CH3) from C3, and a COOH from C1. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are:

- C2: COOH (from C1 as a CH2 group?), a CH(CH3) (from C3), and two methyl groups.

But if C2 is CH(CH3), then it's connected to:

- C1 (which is a CH2-COOH)
- C3 (which is a CH(CH3))
- Two CH3 groups.

Wait, that would make four groups: C1 (CH2-COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two CH3. But the C1 is actually a -CH2-COOH, so C2 is connected to C1's CH2, which is -CH2-COOH. So, substituents on C2 are:

- A CH2-COOH group (from C1)
- A CH(CH3) group (from C3)
- Two CH3 groups.

Wait, no, that can't be because that would require the carbon to have four bonds. Let me count: C2 is connected to C1 (as a CH2 group), C3 (as a CH(CH3)), and two CH3 groups. That's four substituents: yes. But wait, if two substituents are CH3, then the groups would be:

- CH2-COOH
- CH(CH3)
- CH3
- CH3

Wait, no, that would mean two CH3, so the substituents aren't all different. So C2 would have two methyl groups, making it not a chiral center. But the molecule is given as (2R,3S), which implies that each is a stereocenter. So perhaps my analysis is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each of the middle carbons has four different substituents. Let me think again: C2 is connected to:

- The C1: which is a CH2-COOH group.
- The C3: which is a CH(CH3) group.
- A methyl group (CH3)
- Another substituent. Wait, but that's four substituents. But the C2 is a CH(CH3), so it's connected to C1 (CH2-), C3 (CH-), and two CH3. But that would make the groups: CH2, CH, CH3, CH3. So two CH3 groups, making the substituents not all different. So that can't be a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the substituents are:

In 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, each CH2 becomes CH(CH3), so each of those carbons has a methyl group. So the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Then, for each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3), the substituents are:

C2: connected to C1 (which is a CH2-COOH), C3 (which is a CH(CH3)), and two CH3 groups (from the dimethyl). So substituents are:

- CH2-COOH (from C1)
- CH(CH3) (from C3)
- CH3 (from the methyl)
- Another CH3 (from the methyl)

No, that can't be. So no, in that case, C2 would have two CH3 groups, making it not a chiral center. But the molecule is given as (2R,3S), which implies that each is a stereocenter. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps the structure is different. Maybe the substituents are on the same carbon. Wait, but no, the substituents are on 2 and 3. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. If the molecule is meso, it won't be optically active. So, let's think: if the molecule has two stereocenters (C2 and C3) with opposite configurations (R and S), and a plane of symmetry, then it's a meso compound. Let me imagine the structure: HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. If the two stereocenters are R and S, and if the molecule is symmetric, then it would be a meso compound, hence not optically active.

Wait, is there a plane of symmetry here? If the molecule is symmetric along the center, then yes. So in this case, (2R,3S) would make it a meso compound. But wait, (2R,3S) in a symmetric molecule would imply that they're mirror images, leading to no net chirality.

So, in this case, (2R,3S) would make it a meso compound, so no optical activity. Therefore, this compound is not active. Wait, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me think again. If the two stereocenters are in a mirror-image arrangement, the molecule would be meso. For example, tartaric acid is a meso compound when it's (2R,3S) and has a plane of symmetry. So in this case, it would be the same. So this compound is a meso compound. So it's not optically active.

Wait, but wait. The formula for succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. Adding methyl groups to C2 and C3 gives HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. The molecule is symmetric because if you flip it over the center, the configurations would mirror each other. So if C2 is R and C3 is S, that's the same as the mirror image. So the molecule would be meso, meaning no optical activity. Therefore, this compound is not active. So the third compound is not active.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: Same base structure as the previous, but now both stereocenters are R. So the configuration is (2R,3R). Let me think if this is a meso compound. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then (2R,3R) would still make it meso. Wait, no. Because in the meso case, the configurations are opposite. For example, in tartaric acid, (2R,3S) is meso, while (2R,3R) is the actual chiral molecule. So, in this case, (2R,3R) would not have a plane of symmetry, making it a chiral compound. So this molecule has two chiral centers, and no plane of symmetry, so it's optically active. So this fourth compound is active.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: This is a cyclohexene ring with an OH group on C1. The configuration is R. Now, for a cyclohexene, the ring is typically chair conformation, but the substituents determine if there's a chiral center. The OH is on C1. Let's see: the structure is cyclohexene with a hydroxyl group on C1. So the substituents on C1 are the ring, the OH, and two other substituents? Wait, the ring has six carbons. C1 has the OH, and is connected to two adjacent carbons (C2 and C6), and the two substituents are part of the ring. Wait, no. C1 has three ring bonds and one substituent (OH), but wait, carbons in a ring have three ring bonds; the fourth is another substituent. So, if the substituent is OH, then C1 is connected to three ring carbons and one OH. Therefore, C1 is a tetrahedral carbon with four different groups: OH, and three different positions on the ring. So C1 is a chiral center. Therefore, (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol is a chiral molecule. So it's optically active. So this fifth compound is active.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This is a cyclohexane ring with OH groups on C1, C3, and C5. All three positions are s configuration. Now, whether this molecule is chiral depends on whether it has a plane of symmetry. Let me visualize this. If the OH groups are at 1, 3, and 5 positions, which are alternating around the ring. Let me think about whether this is a meso compound or not. For example, if the ring has three substituents, it's possible that the molecule is not chiral if there's a plane of symmetry.

In cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol, the three OH groups are at every other carbon. So the molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the center of the ring, perhaps bisecting between the substituents. Let me imagine: if you have substituents at 1,3,5, the molecule is symmetric in a way that flipping it would not change the configuration. Therefore, the molecule would have an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. So it's not optically active. Alternatively, perhaps it's not symmetric because the arrangement of the OH groups might not allow for a plane of symmetry. Wait, if all three are s configuration, then perhaps the molecule is chiral. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a center of inversion. Wait, when all three substituents are in the same configuration, maybe it's chiral. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, it's not.

Another approach: the molecule is 1,3,5-triol with s configuration on each. Let's imagine that the ring is numbered such that 1,3,5 are all on the same face. If that's the case, then the molecule would be chiral because there's no plane of symmetry. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a way that makes the molecule symmetric, it would be meso.

Wait, I think that in the case of 1,3,5-triol, the molecule is symmetric. Because if you rotate the molecule 120 degrees, the substituents would look the same. Therefore, the molecule would have a center of symmetry. Wait, but each substituent is on a different carbon, so maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the arrangement of the substituents doesn't allow for a plane of symmetry.

I'm a bit unsure here. Let me think of another approach. For a molecule to be chiral, it must lack a plane of symmetry and have at least one chiral center. In this case, each substituent is on a carbon that could potentially be a chiral center. However, if the arrangement is such that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it won't be chiral. So, in 1,3,5-triol, the substituents are spaced equally around the ring, which could create a plane of symmetry. For example, if the molecule can be divided along a plane that reflects one substituent onto another, then it's not chiral.

Alternatively, let's consider the mirror image. If the mirror image is not superimposable, then the molecule is chiral. If the substituents are arranged such that their mirror images would swap positions, then the molecule is chiral. But I'm not entirely confident. I think in this case, the molecule is not chiral because of the symmetry. So, the compound would be meso, hence not optically active. So this sixth compound is not active.

Wait, but wait. If all three OH groups are on the same face, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry that bisects the ring, making it symmetric. So the molecule would be meso, hence no optical activity. Therefore, this compound is not active.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is cyclopentyl group attached to the first carbon of a butanone. So the structure is (cyclopentyl)C(O)CH2CH(CH3)2? Wait, no. Let me think: butan-1-one is (CH3)2CH-CO-. Wait, butan-1-one is (CH2)3CO, but that's not right. Actually, butan-1-one is CH2CH2CH2CO. Wait, no. Wait, butanone can be either 2-butanone (methyl isopropyl ketone) or 3-butanone, but 1-butanone would have the ketone on the first carbon, which is not possible because that would be RCO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, but 1-butanone is possible. So the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-Cyclopentyl? No, wait, 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So the butanone is four carbons with the ketone on C1. So the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-cyclopentyl.

Wait, no. Let me break it down. The parent chain is butan-1-one, which is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But in this case, the substituents are:

- At position 1 (the ketone carbon): cyclopentyl group.
- At position 3: a methyl group.

Wait, actually, the correct IUPAC name would have the substituents at the correct positions. So, 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one would be:

O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-?

Wait, but butan-1-one is four carbons with the ketone at C1. So the structure would be:

O=C-(CH2)2-CH(CH3)

But with a cyclopentyl group on the ketone carbon. Wait, no, the structure is:

O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3?

No, because butan-1-one is (CH3)CH2CH2-CO-? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me reorganize.

The correct structure for 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one is:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl?

Wait, no. Let me think again. Butan-1-one has four carbons:

Positions 1 2 3 4

So the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But in this case, position 1 is the ketone, so the substituents are on C1 and C3.

Wait, the substituents are 1-cyclopentyl and 3-methyl. So:

At C1 (the ketone carbon), a cyclopentyl group is attached.

At C3, a methyl group is attached.

So the structure is:

O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3.

Wait, no, but butan-1-one is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

So substituting C1 with cyclopentyl and C3 with methyl:

O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that would be five carbons, which is pentanone, not butanone.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O=C-(CH2)2-CH(CH3)-cyclopentyl.

No, perhaps the correct structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl.

Wait, that can't be right because butanone has four carbons in the chain.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The main point is whether this compound has a chiral center. The ketone is on C1, so C1 is the carbonyl carbon, which is double-bonded to O, so it's not a chiral center. The substituents are on C3 and elsewhere. Let's see: the structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl.

Wait, but butan-1-one would be O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. So the substituents are at C3 (CH(CH3)) and C1 (cyclopentyl). Wait, substituents on C1 are the cyclopentyl and the carbonyl. So C1 is connected to O=C, cyclopentyl, and two CH2 groups. So four substituents? No, because the carbonyl is a double bond, so C1 is sp2 hybridized. So it's not a chiral center.

Looking at other carbons: the C3 has a methyl group. Let's see what's attached to C3.

In the structure O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl, C3 is CH(CH3), connected to:

- C2: CH2
- C4: CH2
- A methyl group
- And what else? The fourth substituent would be the cyclopentyl group attached to C4? No, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl. So C3 is CH(CH3), which is connected to:

- C2: CH2
- C4: CH2
- A methyl
- And perhaps a hydrogen.

Wait, that would make four substituents: CH2 (from C2), CH2 (from C4), methyl, and H. So C3 has four different substituents, making it a chiral center. So the molecule has a chiral center at C3, so it's optically active. Therefore, the seventh compound is active.

Wait, let me make sure. The molecule is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So the ketone is at C1, which is sp2 hybridized. C3 is CH(CH3), with substituents: CH2 (from C2), CH2 (from C4), a methyl, and a hydrogen. So yes, four different groups, so it's a chiral center. Hence, the compound is active.

Now, let me tally the active compounds:

1. No
2. Yes
3. No (meso)
4. Yes
5. Yes
6. No
7. Yes

So that's compounds 2,4,5,7 active. So four in total.

Wait, wait. Let me recount.

Compounds:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No
2. (3aR,7aS,E)-...: Yes
3. (2R,3S)-...: No
4. (2R,3R)-...: Yes
5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Yes
6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: No
7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Yes

So active compounds are 2,4,5,7 → four. So the answer should be 4.

Looking at the options, option D is 4.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality, which requires at least one chiral center and the absence of a plane of symmetry or internal compensation (meso compound). Here's the analysis for each compound:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This compound is an alkene with a double bond between C1 and C2. Both C1 and C2 are sp² hybridized and cannot be chiral centers. Therefore, this compound is not optically active.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: This complex structure contains multiple stereocenters (3aR and 7aS). Since it has chiral centers and no plane of symmetry, it is optically active.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: Succinic acid has two middle carbons (C2 and C3) that are substituted with methyl groups. The configurations (2R,3S) create a plane of symmetry, making this a meso compound. Meso compounds are not optically active.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: Similar to the previous compound, this structure has two chiral centers (C2 and C3). However, the configurations (2R,3R) do not create a plane of symmetry, making this compound chiral and optically active.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The hydroxyl group on C1 makes it a chiral center. Since the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it is optically active.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This compound has three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The arrangement of substituents creates a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Meso compounds are not optically active.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The ketone group is on C1 (sp² hybridized, not chiral), but C3 has a methyl group and is connected to four different substituents (two CH₂ groups, a methyl, and a hydrogen). This makes C3 a chiral center, and the compound is optically active.

### Summary of optical activity:
- Active compounds: 2, 4, 5, 7  
- Total optically active compounds: 4  

Answer: D

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this question here about optical activity in organic compounds. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it. Optical activity means the compound has chiral centers, right? Or maybe it's about the molecule not having a plane of symmetry or being meso.

The question lists seven compounds, and I need to figure out how many are optically active. Let me go through each one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: Wait, this is a substituted alkene. The configuration is Z. For a molecule to have optical activity, it needs to have a chiral center. Let me draw the structure. 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene has the double bond between C1 and C2. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or wait, but wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? No, wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that can't be right. Wait, but the structure is actually CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2 because but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2X. Wait, no, but 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be on the first carbon. So the structure is ClCH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene is Cl on C1, and a methyl on C2. So C1: Cl, C2: CH(CH3), and the double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, but that would be CH2Cl is C1, C2 is CH(CH3), but that's impossible because C1 is CH2Cl, C2 is CH(CH3), and the double bond is between 1 and 2. So the structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that's butene without the double bond. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's think again.

Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon, so CH2Cl-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's not considering the double bond. Oh, wait, no. 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would have the double bond between C1 and C2, and a methyl group on C2. So structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that's three substituents? Let me count the substituents on each carbon.

On C1: Cl, and two CH2 groups? No, wait, C1 is CH2Cl, and the double bond to C2. C2 has a methyl group, so structure is C1: CH2Cl, double bond to C2: CH(CH3). So the molecule is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2. Wait, how many substituents does each carbon have? For a double bond to have Z configuration, the substituents on each carbon determine the stereochemistry. But for optical activity, we need a chiral center. Let's see, is there a chiral center here?

Looking at the structure: CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2. The double bond is between C1 and C2, with C1 being CH2Cl and C2 being CH(CH3). So C1 is CH2Cl, which is two H's, Cl, and two bonds to the double bond. So it's CH2Cl on C1, which is sp2 hybridized, so no chiral center there. C2 is CH(CH3), but since it's double bonded, it's also sp2. So no chiral centers. So this compound is not chiral. So no optical activity. So this one is not active. Wait, but wait: wait, is there any possibility of a chiral center elsewhere? No, because the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2. So no chiral centers. So this compound is not active.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: Okay, this is a more complex structure. Let me parse the name. Hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione sounds like a fused ring system. Methano suggests a bridge, perhaps. The substituent is chloromethylene (Cl2C=?), which is attached at position 8. The stereochemistry is given as (3aR,7aS,E). E indicates the configuration of the double bond. Now, the question is whether this compound has a chiral center. Let's see: the molecule has six-membered rings, perhaps with substituents. The substituent is chloromethylene, which is an =CHCl group, perhaps attached in a specific way. But regardless of that, the compound has multiple stereocenters as per the (3aR,7aS) part. So these are stereocenters, meaning that the molecule has chiral centers. So it will be optically active. So this compound is active.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So 2 and 3 positions are the two CH2 groups. If both are substituted with methyl groups, then the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Wait, no: succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So 2,3-dimethyl would have methyl groups on both CH2's. So the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Now, are there any chiral centers here? Because the two CH(CH3) groups are on the 2 and 3 positions. Let me look at each carbon. The 2nd carbon: attached to HOOC, CH(CH3), and two CH2's? Wait, no. Let's think: succinic acid is four carbons, with two COOH groups on ends. The middle two are CH2 each. So when you have 2,3-dimethyl, each of those CH2 becomes CH(CH3). So each of the 2 and 3 positions is a carbon with four different groups? Let me see: on the 2nd carbon, the groups are: COOH (from the first carbon), CH(CH3) (from the 3rd), a methyl, and two CH2 groups? Wait, no. Wait, the 2nd carbon is connected to the first (which is COOH), the third (CH(CH3)), and two CH2 groups. Or wait, the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the 2 and 3 carbons has the following groups: for C2, the groups are COOH (from C1), CH(CH3) (from C3), a methyl, and a CH2 (from C3)? No, wait, perhaps each C is attached to two CH(CH3) groups. Wait, maybe I should draw it:

HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) is connected to:

C2: two CH3 groups (from the methyl), a COOH group (from C1), and a CH(CH3) (from C3). Wait, but that would be four substituents. Wait, no: each C has four bonds. C2 is bonded to:

- The C1 (which is HOOC-)
- The C3 (CH(CH3))
- Two methyl groups (from the substituent)

Wait, no, it's 2R and 3S. So each C2 and C3 have two methyl groups. Let me see: for C2, the substituents are: COOH (from C1), two methyl groups (from the dimethyl), and the CH(CH3) from C3. Wait, no, no. Wait, each of the middle carbons is CH(CH3). So for the 2nd carbon, the substituents are: the two CH(CH3) groups on either side, a methyl, and a COOH group. No, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. When you have 2,3-dimethyl, each CH2 becomes CH(CH3). So the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Now, the C2 and C3 each have a CH(CH3) group. For each, the substituents are:

- C2: attached to C1 (COOH-CH2), a methyl group, and two CH(CH3) groups? No, perhaps each C has the following groups: C2 is connected to the C1 (COOH), a methyl (from dimethyl), and two other substituents.

Wait, perhaps the actual groups on C2 are:

- One COOH (from C1)
- One methyl (from the dimethyl)
- Two CH(CH3) groups? No, that doesn't make sense because each carbon can only have four bonds.

Wait, perhaps each C2 and C3 in 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid has four substituents. C2 is attached to:

- The C1 (which is a -CH2-COOH)
- The C3 (which is a -CH(CH3)-)
- Two methyl groups.

Wait, no, because the substituents are methyl on the CH2, which becomes CH(CH3). So the structure is:

HOOC-(CH(CH3))-(CH(CH3))-COOH.

So on each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3), substituents are:

- From C2: two CH(CH3) groups, a COOH group, and a methyl.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Each middle carbon is CH(CH3), so each has:

- Two CH(CH3) groups connected to C1 and C3.
Wait, no, because each is a central carbon. Wait, perhaps for C2, the four substituents are:

- One COOH group (from C1)
- One methyl group (from the CH(CH3))
- Two CH(CH3) groups? No, that can't be right. I'm getting stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps C2 has:

- The COOH (from C1)
- The CH(CH3) (from C3)
- Two methyl groups attached to itself.

Wait, that would make four substituents: COOH, two methyl, and CH(CH3). No, that can't be because that would imply a carbon with five bonds. Hmm. Maybe it's better to approach this differently.

If the compound is (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, then each of C2 and C3 must be chiral centers. Because each has four different substituents. Let me see:

For C2:
- Group 1: COOH (from C1)
- Group 2: CH(CH3) (from C3)
- Group 3: methyl (from the dimethyl)
- Group 4: another substituent? Wait, no, the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So C2 is connected to C1 (which is a -CH(CH3)), C3 (which is a -CH(CH3)), and two methyl groups. Wait, that would make two methyl groups on C2, making it a CH2 group, which is impossible because it's supposed to be dimethyl. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps each of the 2 and 3 positions has a methyl group added to the CH2, making them each CH(CH3). So each of these carbons has four substituents: the two adjacent CH(CH3) groups, a methyl, and a hydrogen? Wait, no, because the CH(CH3) would have two methyls. No, that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps each CH2 in the original succinic acid is replaced by a CH(CH3), meaning each of the middle carbons has a methyl group attached.

So, for C2: substituents are COOH (from C1), CH(CH3) (from C3), and two CH3 groups attached to itself. Wait, that would be four substituents: COOH, CH(CH3), and two CH3. So yes, four different groups? No, because two are CH3. So in that case, C2 would have two methyl groups, making it not a chiral center. Wait, but the configuration is R and S. So perhaps there's something wrong with my analysis.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the actual structure. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. Adding a methyl group to each CH2 would make HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Now, each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) would have:

- C2: attached to C1 (COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two CH3 groups.

Wait, that's four substituents. C2 has COOH (from C1), two methyl groups, and a CH(CH3) (from C3). No, that doesn't make sense because CH(CH3) is a group, but the substituents would be:

Wait, C2 is connected to:

- The C1 (which is -CH(CH3)-COOH)
- The C3 (which is -CH(CH3)-COOH)
- Two methyl groups.

Wait, that can't be because that would be four substituents: two methyls, a CH(CH3) from C3, and a COOH from C1. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are:

- C2: COOH (from C1 as a CH2 group?), a CH(CH3) (from C3), and two methyl groups.

But if C2 is CH(CH3), then it's connected to:

- C1 (which is a CH2-COOH)
- C3 (which is a CH(CH3))
- Two CH3 groups.

Wait, that would make four groups: C1 (CH2-COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two CH3. But the C1 is actually a -CH2-COOH, so C2 is connected to C1's CH2, which is -CH2-COOH. So, substituents on C2 are:

- A CH2-COOH group (from C1)
- A CH(CH3) group (from C3)
- Two CH3 groups.

Wait, no, that can't be because that would require the carbon to have four bonds. Let me count: C2 is connected to C1 (as a CH2 group), C3 (as a CH(CH3)), and two CH3 groups. That's four substituents: yes. But wait, if two substituents are CH3, then the groups would be:

- CH2-COOH
- CH(CH3)
- CH3
- CH3

Wait, no, that would mean two CH3, so the substituents aren't all different. So C2 would have two methyl groups, making it not a chiral center. But the molecule is given as (2R,3S), which implies that each is a stereocenter. So perhaps my analysis is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each of the middle carbons has four different substituents. Let me think again: C2 is connected to:

- The C1: which is a CH2-COOH group.
- The C3: which is a CH(CH3) group.
- A methyl group (CH3)
- Another substituent. Wait, but that's four substituents. But the C2 is a CH(CH3), so it's connected to C1 (CH2-), C3 (CH-), and two CH3. But that would make the groups: CH2, CH, CH3, CH3. So two CH3 groups, making the substituents not all different. So that can't be a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the substituents are:

In 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, each CH2 becomes CH(CH3), so each of those carbons has a methyl group. So the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Then, for each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3), the substituents are:

C2: connected to C1 (which is a CH2-COOH), C3 (which is a CH(CH3)), and two CH3 groups (from the dimethyl). So substituents are:

- CH2-COOH (from C1)
- CH(CH3) (from C3)
- CH3 (from the methyl)
- Another CH3 (from the methyl)

No, that can't be. So no, in that case, C2 would have two CH3 groups, making it not a chiral center. But the molecule is given as (2R,3S), which implies that each is a stereocenter. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps the structure is different. Maybe the substituents are on the same carbon. Wait, but no, the substituents are on 2 and 3. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. If the molecule is meso, it won't be optically active. So, let's think: if the molecule has two stereocenters (C2 and C3) with opposite configurations (R and S), and a plane of symmetry, then it's a meso compound. Let me imagine the structure: HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. If the two stereocenters are R and S, and if the molecule is symmetric, then it would be a meso compound, hence not optically active.

Wait, is there a plane of symmetry here? If the molecule is symmetric along the center, then yes. So in this case, (2R,3S) would make it a meso compound. But wait, (2R,3S) in a symmetric molecule would imply that they're mirror images, leading to no net chirality.

So, in this case, (2R,3S) would make it a meso compound, so no optical activity. Therefore, this compound is not active. Wait, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me think again. If the two stereocenters are in a mirror-image arrangement, the molecule would be meso. For example, tartaric acid is a meso compound when it's (2R,3S) and has a plane of symmetry. So in this case, it would be the same. So this compound is a meso compound. So it's not optically active.

Wait, but wait. The formula for succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. Adding methyl groups to C2 and C3 gives HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. The molecule is symmetric because if you flip it over the center, the configurations would mirror each other. So if C2 is R and C3 is S, that's the same as the mirror image. So the molecule would be meso, meaning no optical activity. Therefore, this compound is not active. So the third compound is not active.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: Same base structure as the previous, but now both stereocenters are R. So the configuration is (2R,3R). Let me think if this is a meso compound. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then (2R,3R) would still make it meso. Wait, no. Because in the meso case, the configurations are opposite. For example, in tartaric acid, (2R,3S) is meso, while (2R,3R) is the actual chiral molecule. So, in this case, (2R,3R) would not have a plane of symmetry, making it a chiral compound. So this molecule has two chiral centers, and no plane of symmetry, so it's optically active. So this fourth compound is active.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: This is a cyclohexene ring with an OH group on C1. The configuration is R. Now, for a cyclohexene, the ring is typically chair conformation, but the substituents determine if there's a chiral center. The OH is on C1. Let's see: the structure is cyclohexene with a hydroxyl group on C1. So the substituents on C1 are the ring, the OH, and two other substituents? Wait, the ring has six carbons. C1 has the OH, and is connected to two adjacent carbons (C2 and C6), and the two substituents are part of the ring. Wait, no. C1 has three ring bonds and one substituent (OH), but wait, carbons in a ring have three ring bonds; the fourth is another substituent. So, if the substituent is OH, then C1 is connected to three ring carbons and one OH. Therefore, C1 is a tetrahedral carbon with four different groups: OH, and three different positions on the ring. So C1 is a chiral center. Therefore, (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol is a chiral molecule. So it's optically active. So this fifth compound is active.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This is a cyclohexane ring with OH groups on C1, C3, and C5. All three positions are s configuration. Now, whether this molecule is chiral depends on whether it has a plane of symmetry. Let me visualize this. If the OH groups are at 1, 3, and 5 positions, which are alternating around the ring. Let me think about whether this is a meso compound or not. For example, if the ring has three substituents, it's possible that the molecule is not chiral if there's a plane of symmetry.

In cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol, the three OH groups are at every other carbon. So the molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the center of the ring, perhaps bisecting between the substituents. Let me imagine: if you have substituents at 1,3,5, the molecule is symmetric in a way that flipping it would not change the configuration. Therefore, the molecule would have an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. So it's not optically active. Alternatively, perhaps it's not symmetric because the arrangement of the OH groups might not allow for a plane of symmetry. Wait, if all three are s configuration, then perhaps the molecule is chiral. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a center of inversion. Wait, when all three substituents are in the same configuration, maybe it's chiral. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, it's not.

Another approach: the molecule is 1,3,5-triol with s configuration on each. Let's imagine that the ring is numbered such that 1,3,5 are all on the same face. If that's the case, then the molecule would be chiral because there's no plane of symmetry. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a way that makes the molecule symmetric, it would be meso.

Wait, I think that in the case of 1,3,5-triol, the molecule is symmetric. Because if you rotate the molecule 120 degrees, the substituents would look the same. Therefore, the molecule would have a center of symmetry. Wait, but each substituent is on a different carbon, so maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the arrangement of the substituents doesn't allow for a plane of symmetry.

I'm a bit unsure here. Let me think of another approach. For a molecule to be chiral, it must lack a plane of symmetry and have at least one chiral center. In this case, each substituent is on a carbon that could potentially be a chiral center. However, if the arrangement is such that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it won't be chiral. So, in 1,3,5-triol, the substituents are spaced equally around the ring, which could create a plane of symmetry. For example, if the molecule can be divided along a plane that reflects one substituent onto another, then it's not chiral.

Alternatively, let's consider the mirror image. If the mirror image is not superimposable, then the molecule is chiral. If the substituents are arranged such that their mirror images would swap positions, then the molecule is chiral. But I'm not entirely confident. I think in this case, the molecule is not chiral because of the symmetry. So, the compound would be meso, hence not optically active. So this sixth compound is not active.

Wait, but wait. If all three OH groups are on the same face, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry that bisects the ring, making it symmetric. So the molecule would be meso, hence no optical activity. Therefore, this compound is not active.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is cyclopentyl group attached to the first carbon of a butanone. So the structure is (cyclopentyl)C(O)CH2CH(CH3)2? Wait, no. Let me think: butan-1-one is (CH3)2CH-CO-. Wait, butan-1-one is (CH2)3CO, but that's not right. Actually, butan-1-one is CH2CH2CH2CO. Wait, no. Wait, butanone can be either 2-butanone (methyl isopropyl ketone) or 3-butanone, but 1-butanone would have the ketone on the first carbon, which is not possible because that would be RCO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, but 1-butanone is possible. So the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-Cyclopentyl? No, wait, 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So the butanone is four carbons with the ketone on C1. So the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-cyclopentyl.

Wait, no. Let me break it down. The parent chain is butan-1-one, which is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But in this case, the substituents are:

- At position 1 (the ketone carbon): cyclopentyl group.
- At position 3: a methyl group.

Wait, actually, the correct IUPAC name would have the substituents at the correct positions. So, 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one would be:

O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-?

Wait, but butan-1-one is four carbons with the ketone at C1. So the structure would be:

O=C-(CH2)2-CH(CH3)

But with a cyclopentyl group on the ketone carbon. Wait, no, the structure is:

O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3?

No, because butan-1-one is (CH3)CH2CH2-CO-? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me reorganize.

The correct structure for 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one is:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl?

Wait, no. Let me think again. Butan-1-one has four carbons:

Positions 1 2 3 4

So the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But in this case, position 1 is the ketone, so the substituents are on C1 and C3.

Wait, the substituents are 1-cyclopentyl and 3-methyl. So:

At C1 (the ketone carbon), a cyclopentyl group is attached.

At C3, a methyl group is attached.

So the structure is:

O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3.

Wait, no, but butan-1-one is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

So substituting C1 with cyclopentyl and C3 with methyl:

O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that would be five carbons, which is pentanone, not butanone.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O=C-(CH2)2-CH(CH3)-cyclopentyl.

No, perhaps the correct structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl.

Wait, that can't be right because butanone has four carbons in the chain.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The main point is whether this compound has a chiral center. The ketone is on C1, so C1 is the carbonyl carbon, which is double-bonded to O, so it's not a chiral center. The substituents are on C3 and elsewhere. Let's see: the structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl.

Wait, but butan-1-one would be O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. So the substituents are at C3 (CH(CH3)) and C1 (cyclopentyl). Wait, substituents on C1 are the cyclopentyl and the carbonyl. So C1 is connected to O=C, cyclopentyl, and two CH2 groups. So four substituents? No, because the carbonyl is a double bond, so C1 is sp2 hybridized. So it's not a chiral center.

Looking at other carbons: the C3 has a methyl group. Let's see what's attached to C3.

In the structure O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl, C3 is CH(CH3), connected to:

- C2: CH2
- C4: CH2
- A methyl group
- And what else? The fourth substituent would be the cyclopentyl group attached to C4? No, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl. So C3 is CH(CH3), which is connected to:

- C2: CH2
- C4: CH2
- A methyl
- And perhaps a hydrogen.

Wait, that would make four substituents: CH2 (from C2), CH2 (from C4), methyl, and H. So C3 has four different substituents, making it a chiral center. So the molecule has a chiral center at C3, so it's optically active. Therefore, the seventh compound is active.

Wait, let me make sure. The molecule is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So the ketone is at C1, which is sp2 hybridized. C3 is CH(CH3), with substituents: CH2 (from C2), CH2 (from C4), a methyl, and a hydrogen. So yes, four different groups, so it's a chiral center. Hence, the compound is active.

Now, let me tally the active compounds:

1. No
2. Yes
3. No (meso)
4. Yes
5. Yes
6. No
7. Yes

So that's compounds 2,4,5,7 active. So four in total.

Wait, wait. Let me recount.

Compounds:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No
2. (3aR,7aS,E)-...: Yes
3. (2R,3S)-...: No
4. (2R,3R)-...: Yes
5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Yes
6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: No
7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Yes

So active compounds are 2,4,5,7 → four. So the answer should be 4.

Looking at the options, option D is 4.


To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality, which requires at least one chiral center and the absence of a plane of symmetry or internal compensation (meso compound). Here's the analysis for each compound:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This compound is an alkene with a double bond between C1 and C2. Both C1 and C2 are sp² hybridized and cannot be chiral centers. Therefore, this compound is not optically active.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: This complex structure contains multiple stereocenters (3aR and 7aS). Since it has chiral centers and no plane of symmetry, it is optically active.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: Succinic acid has two middle carbons (C2 and C3) that are substituted with methyl groups. The configurations (2R,3S) create a plane of symmetry, making this a meso compound. Meso compounds are not optically active.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: Similar to the previous compound, this structure has two chiral centers (C2 and C3). However, the configurations (2R,3R) do not create a plane of symmetry, making this compound chiral and optically active.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The hydroxyl group on C1 makes it a chiral center. Since the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it is optically active.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This compound has three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The arrangement of substituents creates a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Meso compounds are not optically active.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The ketone group is on C1 (sp² hybridized, not chiral), but C3 has a methyl group and is connected to four different substituents (two CH₂ groups, a methyl, and a hydrogen). This makes C3 a chiral center, and the compound is optically active.

### Summary of optical activity:
- Active compounds: 2, 4, 5, 7  
- Total optically active compounds: 4
