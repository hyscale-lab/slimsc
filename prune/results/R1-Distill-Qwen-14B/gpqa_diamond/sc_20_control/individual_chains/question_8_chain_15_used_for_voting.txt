Alright, so I've got this genetics question about gene interactions in plants and their resistance to a fungal disease. Hmm, okay, let me try to break it down.

So, the setup is that they're studying white lupine to find genes that contribute to resistance against anthracnose. They found three genes, G1, G2, G3. They made knock-out mutants for each and some double mutants. Now, they're testing their resistance.

The data given is about the resistance levels of each mutant compared to the wild-type control. The control is 100%, so the mutants' resistances are percentages of that. Let me list them again:

- g1: 75% (so less resistant than wild-type)
- g2: 0% (completely susceptible)
- g3: 50% (moderately less resistant)
- g1g3: 10% (very susceptible)
- g2g3: 0% 
- g1g2: 0%

Wait, the question says at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So, maybe some of these genes are regulated by another.

Now, the question is about the interaction of these genes. The options are A to D, each suggesting different relationships.

Let me think about what each resistance percentage implies. If a single mutant has lower resistance, that suggests that the gene product contributes to resistance. So, a knockout would have less resistance.

In the case of the single mutants:
- g1: 75% – so G1's product is important, but not the only factor.
- g2: 0% – this is a big hit. Without G2, the plant can't resist the disease at all.
- g3: 50% – G3 contributes, but not as much as G2.

Looking at the double mutants:
- g1g2: 0% – both knocked out, same as g2 alone. So knocking out both G1 and G2 leads to no resistance. But since g2 alone is already 0%, this suggests that G2 is upstream or epistatic to G1. Because even without G1, when G2 is already missing, the resistance doesn't get any worse. So G2 is epistatic over G1. Because in the double mutant, the phenotype is the same as the more severe (g2) single mutant.

Wait, what does epistatic mean again? Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on the presence of one or more 'modifier genes'. If gene B is epistatic to gene A, then the phenotype of A depends on B. So, if a double mutant of A and B has the same phenotype as B, it suggests that B is epistatic to A.

So in this case, g1g2 has 0%, same as g2. That would suggest that G2 is epistatic to G1. Because whether you have G1 or not, if G2 is knocked out, the resistance is gone. So G2 is upstream of G1.

Now, looking at the other double mutants:

g1g3: 10% – which is worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%) alone. So the combined effect is worse than either. But not as bad as 0%.

g2g3: 0% – same as g2. So when both G2 and G3 are knocked out, resistance is 0%. But since g2 alone is 0%, the presence of G3 knockout doesn't change that. So again, G2 is epistatic to G3. Because G3's effect is only seen when G2 is present. Hmm, but wait, in the g3 single mutant, the resistance is 50%, which is lower than wild-type but not zero. So when G2 is present, G3 contributes. But when G2 is absent, G3 doesn't help. So G2 might be upstream of G3 as well.

So, putting this together, it seems that G2 is acting upstream of both G1 and G3. Because when G2 is knocked out, the resistance drops to 0%, regardless of G1 or G3. So G2 is a transcription factor, perhaps, activating both G1 and G3. Because in the absence of G2, the other two genes don't matter.

Wait, but in the g3 single mutant, the resistance is 50%—so G3 alone can provide some resistance. So the presence of G3 is contributing, but when G2 is present, G3 can function. But without G2, G3 can't function. Hmm, that's a bit conflicting.

Wait, perhaps G2 is the transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. So if G2 is not present, neither G1 nor G3 can function. So when G2 is knocked out, both downstream genes are not expressed, leading to 0% resistance.

But wait, the g1 mutant is 75%—so without G1, there's some resistance left. So G1 is one of the downstream genes, but maybe there's another pathway or another gene contributing. Or perhaps G3 is also downstream but contributes less.

Wait, the question says that in the double mutants, g1g3 has 10% resistance. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either alone. But when G2 is absent, even if G1 is present, resistance is 0% (g1g2:0%).

Hmm. So perhaps G2 is required for both G1 and G3 to function. So without G2, G1 and G3 can't contribute. But when G2 is present, both G1 and G3 contribute to the resistance.

Looking at the options, which one fits this?

Option A: G1 is a TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Wait, but in our case, G2 is the TF. Because in the absence of G2, the resistance plummets. So the TF is G2. So option A says G1 is a TF, which may not be correct.

Option B: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Hmm. Same promoter? I'm not sure. The data doesn't directly show anything about their promoters. Also, G3 epistatic towards G1? But in the g1g3 double mutant, the resistance is 10%, worse than either single. So that suggests that G1 and G3 are additive. If G3 were epistatic, then the double mutant would be same as G3, but it's worse. So that might not fit.

Option C: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy would mean that G1 and G3 have multiple effects. But not sure if that's relevant here. Let me think about the epistasis part. If G1 is epistatic towards G3, that would mean that G1's presence masks G3's effect. So in the double mutant, the phenotype would be the same as G1. But in our case, the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either. So that doesn't fit. So maybe this option is incorrect.

Option D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy is when two genes can compensate for each other. So if either is present, the function is okay. But if both are missing, the function is lost. Looking at the data, when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than each single mutant. So, in the single mutants, g1 is 75% and g3 is 50%. So 75% is higher than 50%—so perhaps G1 contributes more than G3. So when both are knocked out, you get even less resistance. So that's not redundancy because redundancy would imply that knocking out both doesn't make it worse than the worse one. Hmm.

Wait, if G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, and both contribute to the same process. So without G1, you lose some resistance; without G3, even more. Without both, you lose even more. So it's additive. So they might not be redundant. Redundancy would imply that either can do the same job, so their combined knockout doesn't have a worse phenotype than the worse single.

Let's get back to the options. The correct option should identify G2 as the TF because the single mutant g2 has 0% resistance, while the others have some. So when G2 is not present, nothing works. So G2 is the TF activating other genes.

Looking at the double mutant g1g3: 10% resistance. So that's worse than either G1 or G3 alone. So their effects are additive. So if G1 and G3 are in the same pathway and work additively, perhaps they are in parallel pathways. So when both are knocked out, the resistance drops further.

Now, the question is about the epistatic relationships. From the data, G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3 because when G2 is absent, the others' effects don't matter. So that suggests G2 is upstream.

Now, looking at the double mutants between G1 and G3: the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single. So the effect isn't epistatic between them. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, maybe both downstream of G2, but not epistatic to each other. Or maybe they're in separate pathways.

Wait, another thought. If G2 is a transcription factor activating both G1 and G3, then in the absence of G2, neither G1 nor G3 is expressed. So, the phenotype would be same as G2 knockout. But in the case of the double mutants like g1g3, which is 10%, which is worse than either G1 (75%) or G3 (50%) alone. So that suggests that G1 and G3 are providing additive effects when both are present. So when both are knocked out, the effect is more severe than either single.

So, how do the options fit?

Option C says G1 is epistatic towards G3. So in the double mutant, the phenotype would be same as G1. But in our case, it's 10%, which is worse than G1's 75%. So that doesn't fit.

Option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. So again, double mutant would look like G1. But it's not. So D may not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 is not epistatic. So maybe G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, which makes their effects additive.

So, in the options, looking for which one says G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are additive.

Looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is TF, which I don't think so. No.

Option B: G2 is TF, but G3 is epistatic towards G1. So in the double mutant, it would be same as G3. But the double is 10%, which is worse than G3's 50%. So that's not matching.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. Hmm, not sure about pleiotropy here. Pleiotropy is when a gene affects multiple traits, but here maybe not directly. But the key is the epistatic part. C says G1 is epistatic towards G3. As discussed, not matching the data.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. Hmm. Gene redundancy would imply that either G1 or G3 can do the job, so their combined knockout is worse. But in this case, the double mutant (g1g3) is 10%, which is worse than either, so that suggests that they are not redundant. So D might not fit.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

Wait, when G2 is present (so not in the double or single where G2 is knocked out), G1 and G3 contribute to resistance.

The single mutants:

g1: 75% → so G1 contributes 25% to resistance (since 100% -75% is 25%)

g3: 50% → G3 contributes 50% of the resistance.

Wait, but if G2 is the TF activating both, then when G2 is working, G1 and G3 are expressed, contributing 75% + 50% → but that can't be additive. Wait, but 75% +50% would be 125%, which is more than the control. But the control is 100%, so this suggests perhaps the contributions are not additive but maybe in a pathway.

Wait, perhaps when both G1 and G3 are present (along with G2), the resistance is 100%. So:

In wild-type: 100%.

g1: G2 and G3 present, but G1 is knocked out. So resistance is 50% (g3's contribution). Wait, but no, in the data, g1 is 75%. Hmm, that doesn't add up.

Wait, perhaps I should model this.

Let me think, using the data:

Wild-type: 100% resistance.

g1: 75% → so without G1, the resistance is 75% of control. So G1 contributes 25% of the resistance.

g2: 0% → G2 is essential. So G2 is necessary for any resistance.

g3: 50% → G3 contributes 50% of the resistance.

In the double mutants:

g1g2: 0% → same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G1.

g1g3: 10% → which is worse than either single (75% or 50%). So G1 and G3 contribute additively. So when both are knocked out, the resistance is 100% -75% -50% = negative, but they can't be negative, so perhaps the actual model is that G1 and G3 each contribute a part, and the remaining comes from another source.

Wait, but without G2, it's 0%, so any contributions from G1 and G3 require G2.

So, when G2 is present, the total resistance is contributed by all active genes (G1, G3, and possibly others). So let's model:

Total resistance = 100% when all are present.

In g1: G2 and G3 present → resistance is 75% → so G3 contributes 50% (g3 is 50%). So perhaps G1 contributes the other 25%.

In g3: G1 and G2 present → resistance is 50% → so G1 contributes 25%, G3 contributes 50%.

In the double mutant g1g3: both G1 and G3 are knocked out, but G2 is present → resistance is 10%. So where does this 10% come from? Maybe another gene, say G4, which is active only when G2 is present, but not dependent on G1 or G3.

So, perhaps the resistance is a combination of G2-dependent factors. So when G2 is present, it activates G1, G3, and maybe others. Without G1 and G3, but with G2, you get 10% from another gene. Hmm.

But regardless, the key is the epistatic relationships.

So, the main point is that G2 is upstream of G1 and G3, as its knockout completely eliminates resistance. So G2 is a transcription factor. Then, when G2 is present, both G1 and G3 contribute to the resistance.

Now, looking at the options, which is correct?

Option A: G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

But we've concluded G2 is the TF, so A is incorrect.

Option B: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Same promoter—could mean they are co-regulated. But the data doesn't directly show that. Also, G3 being epistatic towards G1 would mean that in the double mutant, the phenotype is same as G3. But in this case, the double mutant is worse than G3 (10% vs 50%), so this doesn't fit.

Option C: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy is when a gene affects multiple traits, but here, G1 and G3's effects seem additive. Also, G1 being epistatic towards G3 would mean that the double mutant would look like G1. But in this case, the double mutant is worse than G1 (75% → double is 10%). So that doesn't fit.

Option D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy would imply that when either gene is present, the function is okay. So the double mutant would be same as the worse single. But the double mutant is 10%, worse than either. So gene redundancy is probably not the case.

Wait, but perhaps my understanding is incorrect. Let me think again about redundancy. Redundancy is when two genes can compensate for each other. So if both are knocked out, the phenotype is worse than either single. For example, if each gene contributes 50%, then knocking out both would result in 0%, which is worse than each single (50%). But in our case, when both are knocked out, it's 10%, which is worse than each. So perhaps they are redundant but not fully. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, contributing additively. So if one is knocked out, the other can compensate, but not fully. If both are knocked out, no compensation, leading to a more severe phenotype.

So, in that case, G1 and G3 are not redundant, but part of separate pathways. So perhaps the correct answer is option C or D.

Wait, option C says G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. I'm not sure what that implies here. Alternatively, maybe they're in the same pathway, so their effects are additive.

But looking back at the question, the options are about which conclusion can be drawn. So the only thing I can be certain of is that G2 is the TF, as its knockout completely abolishes resistance, and it's epistatic to both G1 and G3.

So in the options, the correct choice should have G2 as the TF and G2 being epistatic to the others.

Looking at the options:

Option A: G2 isn't the TF. Wrong.

Option B: G2 is TF, but says G3 is epistatic to G1. But in g1g3, the resistance is worse than G1 or G3. So that's not the case.

Option C: G2 is TF, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. As in, G1's presence masks G3. But the data doesn't fit that.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. But the double mutant is worse than either, so redundancy isn't correct.

Wait, perhaps the situation is that G2 is the TF, and both G1 and G3 are downstream of G2. But they function in parallel pathways, so their effects are additive. So without G2, both are non-functional, leading to 0% resistance.

In the double mutants, when G2 is present (like in g1g3), the resistance is additive. So 75% (g1) and 50% (g3), but the double is 10%—so perhaps 75% +50% is 125%, but the actual is 10%, which is the remaining from other factors.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's approach it differently.

The key points from the data:

- g2 is the most severe, 0%, so G2 is essential for any resistance.

- g1g2 and g2g3 are 0%, which shows that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. Because in the double mutants, the resistance is same as when G2 is knocked out.

Now, looking at the double mutants involving G1 and G3:

g1g3 is 10% resistance. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, even though G2 is present, resistance is very low.

Which suggests that G1 and G3 contribute to the resistance when G2 is present. So when G2 is present, G1 and G3 are active, and their combined presence contributes to higher resistance.

But when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, there's minimal resistance.

So, this suggests that G1 and G3 are both involved in the same pathway, but their effects are additive. So they might be working in parallel.

So, looking back at the options, which option says that G2 is the TF and that G1 and G3 are additive (not epistatic to each other)?

Looking at the options:

Option A: No, G1 is the TF.

Option B: G2 is TF, but G3 is epistatic to G1. So the double would be same as G3, which is 50%, but the actual is 10%. So no.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. I'm not sure about pleiotropy, but the epistasis doesn't fit.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. So redundancy would imply that the double mutant is same as either, but it's worse. So D is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Another approach is to figure out which options are incorrect.

Option B: G2 is a TF. That's correct. Now, G1 and G3 have the same promoter. How could that affect the data? If they have the same promoter, then knocking out G2 (the TF) would also knock out both G1 and G3. But in the data, the single mutant for g1 exists. So the promoter must be different. So option B is incorrect.

So the only correct option that has G2 as TF is either option C or D.

Between C and D, both have G2 as TF.

Option C says G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. I don't think that's the case here. Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits, but here, each contributes to the same trait (resistance), so perhaps not.

Option D: G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. As discussed earlier, the data doesn't fit because the double mutant is worse than either single. So redundancy isn't the case.

Wait, so maybe none of the options perfectly fit, but I have to pick the best one.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about the gene redundancy. Let me reconsider.

Gene redundancy is when two genes have overlapping functions, so their combined knockout leads to a more severe phenotype than either single. So in this case, the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either (75% and 50%). So this supports the idea that G1 and G3 are redundant. Because when both are knocked out, the phenotype is worse than either single.

Wait, but wait, no. Redundancy implies that each can perform the other's function. So if you have one, you're okay. If you lose both, then you have a problem. So the double mutant should be as bad as the worst single.

In our case, the double mutant is worse than the worst single (50% is worse than 10%). So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps they are not redundant but additive. So their combined effect is more than either.

So, in that case, G1 and G3 are not redundant but additive. So their combined knockout would result in a worse phenotype than either single.

But looking back at the options, which one describes this?

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, which isn't correct.

Option C says G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, which I'm not sure about. Alternatively, perhaps the question is leading towards G1 and G3 being in the same pathway, and their effects are additive.

Wait, the question states that at least one gene is a transcription factor. So perhaps G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are under its regulation.

So, the correct option must have G2 as the TF, and G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

Looking at the options again:

A) G1 is TF: incorrect.

B) G2 is TF. But says G3 is epistatic towards G1. Not matching.

C) G2 is TF. G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. Not sure. Also says G1 is epistatic towards G3: but data doesn't fit.

D) G2 is TF. G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. No, as discussed.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is none of the above, but since I have to choose, I'll think again.

Another approach: in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and their combined knockout leads to a more severe phenotype. So they are additive.

But the only option that has G2 as TF is options C and D.

Option C says G1 is epistatic to G3. If that were the case, in the double, it would be same as G1 (75%). But it's 10%, so that's not the case.

Option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. Same issue.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 are downstream, and G1 and G3 are additive. But none of the options directly state this.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option A.

Wait, option A says G1 is a TF, which can't be correct because g1 is only 75%—so G1's function isn't as critical as G2's, which is 0%.

So, the only option left that makes sense is option C.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about what each option is suggesting.

Option C: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy would mean that G1 affects multiple traits. But in our case, G1 and G3 are both contributing to the same trait (resistance). So maybe they're not pleiotropic. So option C is incorrect.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But as I thought earlier, the double mutant's 10% is worse than either single, so redundancy isn't correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the terms. Let me check what 'epistatic towards' means. If G1 is epistatic towards G3, then the phenotype of G3 is masked by G1. So in the double mutant, the phenotype would resemble G1.

But in our data, the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than G1's 75% and G3's 50%. So that's not the case. So C is incorrect.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about which options are possible based on the data.

The key points are:

- G2 is the TF because g2's resistance is 0%, the most severe.

- G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

- G1 and G3 are additive (their combined knockout is worse than either single).

So, looking for an option that states:

G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are additive (so their effects are not epistatic).

Looking at the options, none of them directly state that. But looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. But I'm not convinced.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. But again, the data doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I should think what each option implies about the double mutants.

Option C: G1 is epistatic towards G3. So when both are knocked out, the phenotype should be same as G1. But it's 10%, which is worse than G1. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: G1 is epistatic towards G3. Same reasoning, so incorrect.

So, perhaps the correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are additive. But looking at the options, which one includes this?

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Because G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. Maybe they're involved in other traits, but perhaps in this question, their effects are additive here.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, with G1 acting epistatic to G3. But in our case, the double mutant is 10%, which is worse than either.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A: G1 is a TF, but that doesn't fit the data because G1's single mutant is 75%, which isn't as severe as G2's 0%.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option C or D. But I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should think about what gene redundancy means. If G1 and G3 are redundant, their functions can compensate for each other. So, if G1 is knocked out, G3 can take over, and vice versa. But in the double mutant, both are knocked out, so the phenotype is worse than either single. Let's see:

In g1: 75% → G3 is present, so perhaps G3 can't fully compensate. So maybe the redundancy isn't complete.

In g3: 50% → G1 is present, but can't fully compensate.

So, in the double mutant, 10% → perhaps another gene is contributing, but it's not enough.

Hmm. So, perhaps G1 and G3 are partially redundant, but not fully. So in the absence of both, another gene contributes minimally.

But the options don't mention this. So, perhaps the correct answer is option D: gene redundancy, but since the data doesn't directly support it, I'm not sure.

Alternate approach: let's think about which options correctly model the phenotypes.

Option B: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic to G1.

Same promoter would mean that knocking out the TF (G2) would knock out both. But we have g1 and g3 as single mutants, so their promoters must be different. So option B is incorrect.

Option A: G1 is TF. No, because g1 is 75%, so can't be.

So, now the only remaining options are C and D.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

In the data, the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, worse than either. So if G1 is epistatic towards G3, the double should be like G1 (75%), but it's worse. So C is incorrect.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy would imply that the double mutant is the same as the worse single. But in this case, the double is worse than G3 (50% → 10%). So D is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the epistatic relationships again.

The double mutant g1g2 is 0%, same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G1.

The double mutant g2g3 is 0%, same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G3.

The double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either G1 (75%) or G3 (50%). So the effects are additive.

So, in this case, the G1 and G3 are additive, not epistatic.

So, looking for an option that says G2 is TF, and G1 and G3 are additive (no epistasis between them).

But none of the options directly state this. So perhaps the correct answer is option C or D.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is none of the options, but since I have to choose, I'll make a decision.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But I'm still not entirely confident.

Wait, another angle: The gene redundancy would mean that if either G1 or G3 is present, the function is okay. But if both are knocked out, the function is lost. But in this case, the double mutant is 10%, not 0%. So it's not gene redundancy.

So, perhaps the answer is option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, but I'm not convinced.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A: but that can't be because G2 is the TF.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 are additive, but the options don't directly state that.

Hmm, I'm really stuck. I think based on the data, the correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 function additively, and G2 is epistatic to both.

Looking at the options, option C says G2 is TF, G1 is epistatic towards G3. But data doesn't fit.

Option D: G2 is TF, gene redundancy between G1 and G3, but data doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is option A: but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Because they're additive, but since the only option that has G2 as TF is C and D, and I can't find a better fit, I'll have to make a choice.

Wait, another thought: The fact that g1g3 is 10% suggests that there's another gene contributing, say G4, which is activated by G2 but not by G1 or G3. So when G1 and G3 are knocked out, but G2 is present, G4 can only contribute 10%. So perhaps G1 and G3 are not directly under G2, but part of a network.

But regardless, the conclusion about the epistatic relationships must be made.

So, with all that, the best fit seems to be option D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is option C: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy (but I don't see how), and G1 is epistatic towards G3. But the data doesn't support epistasis between G1 and G3.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option C. No, I'm not convinced.

Wait, perhaps I should just choose option C.

Wait, looking back at the options, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

After all, the only thing that stands out is that G2 is the TF, so the correct option must have G2 as TF. The only options that have G2 as TF are B, C, and D. But I think option C is the only one that correctly places G2 as TF. Let me think.

Wait, no. Option B also says G2 is TF. So, perhaps option B is incorrect because of the other parts.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

I think I'm going in circles. Based on the data and the reasoning, the best conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. Also, the fact that the double mutant g1g3 is 10% suggests that G1 and G3 are additive.

Looking at the options, none say that G1 and G3 are additive. So perhaps the correct answer is option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is none of the above. But since I have to choose, I think option C is the closest.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about epistatic relationships.

Epistatic gene is the one whose product is upstream and thus masks the effect of the other gene.

So, if G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3, as shown by the double mutants, then G2 is upstream.

So, the only option that correctly identifies G2 as the TF is C and D. Now, looking at the other parts of the options.

Option C: G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. Not sure.

Option D: G1 and G3 show gene redundancy.

But the data suggests they are additive. So perhaps none of the options are correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm not sure.

I think I've thought this through as much as I can. Based on the data and reasoning, the correct answer is that G2 is a transcription factor, and G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. Among the options, the correct one is option C or D.

But I'm going to settle on option C: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but the data doesn't support G1 being epistatic towards G3. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But since I'm not fully confident, I'll make a choice.

The experiment investigates the interaction of three genes (G1, G2, G3) in white lupine resistance to anthracnose. The data shows resistance levels of single and double mutants compared to the wild-type control (100% resistance). Key findings include:

1. **Single mutants**:  
   - **g1**: 75% resistance, indicating G1 contributes to resistance.  
   - **g2**: 0% resistance, indicating G2 is essential for resistance.  
   - **g3**: 50% resistance, indicating G3 contributes but is less critical than G2.  

2. **Double mutants**:  
   - **g1g2**: 0% resistance, same as g2, showing G2 is epistatic to G1.  
   - **g1g3**: 10% resistance, worse than either single mutant, suggesting additive effects of G1 and G3.  
   - **g2g3**: 0% resistance, same as g2, showing G2 is epistatic to G3.  

From this, **G2 is identified as the transcription factor (TF)** because its knockout (g2) completely abolishes resistance (0%), and it is epistatic to both G1 and G3. The double mutant g1g3 (10%) indicates that G1 and G3 contribute additively to resistance when G2 is present.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. It claims G1 is the TF, but g1 has 75% resistance, indicating G1 is not essential for resistance.  
- **Option B**: Incorrect. While G2 is correctly identified as the TF, it claims G1 and G3 have the same promoter and G3 is epistatic to G1. The data does not support these claims.  
- **Option C**: Partially correct. G2 is correctly identified as the TF, and G1 and G3 show additive effects. However, the claim that G1 is epistatic to G3 is inconsistent with the data, as the double mutant g1g3 (10%) is worse than either single mutant.  
- **Option D**: Incorrect. While G2 is correctly identified as the TF, the claim of gene redundancy between G1 and G3 is inconsistent with the data. The double mutant g1g3 (10%) is worse than either single mutant, indicating additive, not redundant, effects.  

### Conclusion:
The best-supported conclusion is that **G2 is the transcription factor**, and G1 and G3 contribute additively to resistance when G2 is present. However, none of the options fully align with the data. Based on the reasoning provided, **Option C** is the closest, despite its inaccuracies regarding epistasis.

ANSWER: C

Alright, so I've got this genetics question about gene interactions in plants and their resistance to a fungal disease. Hmm, okay, let me try to break it down.

So, the setup is that they're studying white lupine to find genes that contribute to resistance against anthracnose. They found three genes, G1, G2, G3. They made knock-out mutants for each and some double mutants. Now, they're testing their resistance.

The data given is about the resistance levels of each mutant compared to the wild-type control. The control is 100%, so the mutants' resistances are percentages of that. Let me list them again:

- g1: 75% (so less resistant than wild-type)
- g2: 0% (completely susceptible)
- g3: 50% (moderately less resistant)
- g1g3: 10% (very susceptible)
- g2g3: 0% 
- g1g2: 0%

Wait, the question says at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So, maybe some of these genes are regulated by another.

Now, the question is about the interaction of these genes. The options are A to D, each suggesting different relationships.

Let me think about what each resistance percentage implies. If a single mutant has lower resistance, that suggests that the gene product contributes to resistance. So, a knockout would have less resistance.

In the case of the single mutants:
- g1: 75% – so G1's product is important, but not the only factor.
- g2: 0% – this is a big hit. Without G2, the plant can't resist the disease at all.
- g3: 50% – G3 contributes, but not as much as G2.

Looking at the double mutants:
- g1g2: 0% – both knocked out, same as g2 alone. So knocking out both G1 and G2 leads to no resistance. But since g2 alone is already 0%, this suggests that G2 is upstream or epistatic to G1. Because even without G1, when G2 is already missing, the resistance doesn't get any worse. So G2 is epistatic over G1. Because in the double mutant, the phenotype is the same as the more severe (g2) single mutant.

Wait, what does epistatic mean again? Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on the presence of one or more 'modifier genes'. If gene B is epistatic to gene A, then the phenotype of A depends on B. So, if a double mutant of A and B has the same phenotype as B, it suggests that B is epistatic to A.

So in this case, g1g2 has 0%, same as g2. That would suggest that G2 is epistatic to G1. Because whether you have G1 or not, if G2 is knocked out, the resistance is gone. So G2 is upstream of G1.

Now, looking at the other double mutants:

g1g3: 10% – which is worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%) alone. So the combined effect is worse than either. But not as bad as 0%.

g2g3: 0% – same as g2. So when both G2 and G3 are knocked out, resistance is 0%. But since g2 alone is 0%, the presence of G3 knockout doesn't change that. So again, G2 is epistatic to G3. Because G3's effect is only seen when G2 is present. Hmm, but wait, in the g3 single mutant, the resistance is 50%, which is lower than wild-type but not zero. So when G2 is present, G3 contributes. But when G2 is absent, G3 doesn't help. So G2 might be upstream of G3 as well.

So, putting this together, it seems that G2 is acting upstream of both G1 and G3. Because when G2 is knocked out, the resistance drops to 0%, regardless of G1 or G3. So G2 is a transcription factor, perhaps, activating both G1 and G3. Because in the absence of G2, the other two genes don't matter.

Wait, but in the g3 single mutant, the resistance is 50%—so G3 alone can provide some resistance. So the presence of G3 is contributing, but when G2 is present, G3 can function. But without G2, G3 can't function. Hmm, that's a bit conflicting.

Wait, perhaps G2 is the transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. So if G2 is not present, neither G1 nor G3 can function. So when G2 is knocked out, both downstream genes are not expressed, leading to 0% resistance.

But wait, the g1 mutant is 75%—so without G1, there's some resistance left. So G1 is one of the downstream genes, but maybe there's another pathway or another gene contributing. Or perhaps G3 is also downstream but contributes less.

Wait, the question says that in the double mutants, g1g3 has 10% resistance. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either alone. But when G2 is absent, even if G1 is present, resistance is 0% (g1g2:0%).

Hmm. So perhaps G2 is required for both G1 and G3 to function. So without G2, G1 and G3 can't contribute. But when G2 is present, both G1 and G3 contribute to the resistance.

Looking at the options, which one fits this?

Option A: G1 is a TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Wait, but in our case, G2 is the TF. Because in the absence of G2, the resistance plummets. So the TF is G2. So option A says G1 is a TF, which may not be correct.

Option B: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Hmm. Same promoter? I'm not sure. The data doesn't directly show anything about their promoters. Also, G3 epistatic towards G1? But in the g1g3 double mutant, the resistance is 10%, worse than either single. So that suggests that G1 and G3 are additive. If G3 were epistatic, then the double mutant would be same as G3, but it's worse. So that might not fit.

Option C: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy would mean that G1 and G3 have multiple effects. But not sure if that's relevant here. Let me think about the epistasis part. If G1 is epistatic towards G3, that would mean that G1's presence masks G3's effect. So in the double mutant, the phenotype would be the same as G1. But in our case, the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either. So that doesn't fit. So maybe this option is incorrect.

Option D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy is when two genes can compensate for each other. So if either is present, the function is okay. But if both are missing, the function is lost. Looking at the data, when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than each single mutant. So, in the single mutants, g1 is 75% and g3 is 50%. So 75% is higher than 50%—so perhaps G1 contributes more than G3. So when both are knocked out, you get even less resistance. So that's not redundancy because redundancy would imply that knocking out both doesn't make it worse than the worse one. Hmm.

Wait, if G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, and both contribute to the same process. So without G1, you lose some resistance; without G3, even more. Without both, you lose even more. So it's additive. So they might not be redundant. Redundancy would imply that either can do the same job, so their combined knockout doesn't have a worse phenotype than the worse single.

Let's get back to the options. The correct option should identify G2 as the TF because the single mutant g2 has 0% resistance, while the others have some. So when G2 is not present, nothing works. So G2 is the TF activating other genes.

Looking at the double mutant g1g3: 10% resistance. So that's worse than either G1 or G3 alone. So their effects are additive. So if G1 and G3 are in the same pathway and work additively, perhaps they are in parallel pathways. So when both are knocked out, the resistance drops further.

Now, the question is about the epistatic relationships. From the data, G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3 because when G2 is absent, the others' effects don't matter. So that suggests G2 is upstream.

Now, looking at the double mutants between G1 and G3: the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single. So the effect isn't epistatic between them. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, maybe both downstream of G2, but not epistatic to each other. Or maybe they're in separate pathways.

Wait, another thought. If G2 is a transcription factor activating both G1 and G3, then in the absence of G2, neither G1 nor G3 is expressed. So, the phenotype would be same as G2 knockout. But in the case of the double mutants like g1g3, which is 10%, which is worse than either G1 (75%) or G3 (50%) alone. So that suggests that G1 and G3 are providing additive effects when both are present. So when both are knocked out, the effect is more severe than either single.

So, how do the options fit?

Option C says G1 is epistatic towards G3. So in the double mutant, the phenotype would be same as G1. But in our case, it's 10%, which is worse than G1's 75%. So that doesn't fit.

Option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. So again, double mutant would look like G1. But it's not. So D may not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 is not epistatic. So maybe G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, which makes their effects additive.

So, in the options, looking for which one says G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are additive.

Looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is TF, which I don't think so. No.

Option B: G2 is TF, but G3 is epistatic towards G1. So in the double mutant, it would be same as G3. But the double is 10%, which is worse than G3's 50%. So that's not matching.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. Hmm, not sure about pleiotropy here. Pleiotropy is when a gene affects multiple traits, but here maybe not directly. But the key is the epistatic part. C says G1 is epistatic towards G3. As discussed, not matching the data.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. Hmm. Gene redundancy would imply that either G1 or G3 can do the job, so their combined knockout is worse. But in this case, the double mutant (g1g3) is 10%, which is worse than either, so that suggests that they are not redundant. So D might not fit.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

Wait, when G2 is present (so not in the double or single where G2 is knocked out), G1 and G3 contribute to resistance.

The single mutants:

g1: 75% → so G1 contributes 25% to resistance (since 100% -75% is 25%)

g3: 50% → G3 contributes 50% of the resistance.

Wait, but if G2 is the TF activating both, then when G2 is working, G1 and G3 are expressed, contributing 75% + 50% → but that can't be additive. Wait, but 75% +50% would be 125%, which is more than the control. But the control is 100%, so this suggests perhaps the contributions are not additive but maybe in a pathway.

Wait, perhaps when both G1 and G3 are present (along with G2), the resistance is 100%. So:

In wild-type: 100%.

g1: G2 and G3 present, but G1 is knocked out. So resistance is 50% (g3's contribution). Wait, but no, in the data, g1 is 75%. Hmm, that doesn't add up.

Wait, perhaps I should model this.

Let me think, using the data:

Wild-type: 100% resistance.

g1: 75% → so without G1, the resistance is 75% of control. So G1 contributes 25% of the resistance.

g2: 0% → G2 is essential. So G2 is necessary for any resistance.

g3: 50% → G3 contributes 50% of the resistance.

In the double mutants:

g1g2: 0% → same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G1.

g1g3: 10% → which is worse than either single (75% or 50%). So G1 and G3 contribute additively. So when both are knocked out, the resistance is 100% -75% -50% = negative, but they can't be negative, so perhaps the actual model is that G1 and G3 each contribute a part, and the remaining comes from another source.

Wait, but without G2, it's 0%, so any contributions from G1 and G3 require G2.

So, when G2 is present, the total resistance is contributed by all active genes (G1, G3, and possibly others). So let's model:

Total resistance = 100% when all are present.

In g1: G2 and G3 present → resistance is 75% → so G3 contributes 50% (g3 is 50%). So perhaps G1 contributes the other 25%.

In g3: G1 and G2 present → resistance is 50% → so G1 contributes 25%, G3 contributes 50%.

In the double mutant g1g3: both G1 and G3 are knocked out, but G2 is present → resistance is 10%. So where does this 10% come from? Maybe another gene, say G4, which is active only when G2 is present, but not dependent on G1 or G3.

So, perhaps the resistance is a combination of G2-dependent factors. So when G2 is present, it activates G1, G3, and maybe others. Without G1 and G3, but with G2, you get 10% from another gene. Hmm.

But regardless, the key is the epistatic relationships.

So, the main point is that G2 is upstream of G1 and G3, as its knockout completely eliminates resistance. So G2 is a transcription factor. Then, when G2 is present, both G1 and G3 contribute to the resistance.

Now, looking at the options, which is correct?

Option A: G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

But we've concluded G2 is the TF, so A is incorrect.

Option B: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Same promoter—could mean they are co-regulated. But the data doesn't directly show that. Also, G3 being epistatic towards G1 would mean that in the double mutant, the phenotype is same as G3. But in this case, the double mutant is worse than G3 (10% vs 50%), so this doesn't fit.

Option C: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy is when a gene affects multiple traits, but here, G1 and G3's effects seem additive. Also, G1 being epistatic towards G3 would mean that the double mutant would look like G1. But in this case, the double mutant is worse than G1 (75% → double is 10%). So that doesn't fit.

Option D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy would imply that when either gene is present, the function is okay. So the double mutant would be same as the worse single. But the double mutant is 10%, worse than either. So gene redundancy is probably not the case.

Wait, but perhaps my understanding is incorrect. Let me think again about redundancy. Redundancy is when two genes can compensate for each other. So if both are knocked out, the phenotype is worse than either single. For example, if each gene contributes 50%, then knocking out both would result in 0%, which is worse than each single (50%). But in our case, when both are knocked out, it's 10%, which is worse than each. So perhaps they are redundant but not fully. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, contributing additively. So if one is knocked out, the other can compensate, but not fully. If both are knocked out, no compensation, leading to a more severe phenotype.

So, in that case, G1 and G3 are not redundant, but part of separate pathways. So perhaps the correct answer is option C or D.

Wait, option C says G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. I'm not sure what that implies here. Alternatively, maybe they're in the same pathway, so their effects are additive.

But looking back at the question, the options are about which conclusion can be drawn. So the only thing I can be certain of is that G2 is the TF, as its knockout completely abolishes resistance, and it's epistatic to both G1 and G3.

So in the options, the correct choice should have G2 as the TF and G2 being epistatic to the others.

Looking at the options:

Option A: G2 isn't the TF. Wrong.

Option B: G2 is TF, but says G3 is epistatic to G1. But in g1g3, the resistance is worse than G1 or G3. So that's not the case.

Option C: G2 is TF, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. As in, G1's presence masks G3. But the data doesn't fit that.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. But the double mutant is worse than either, so redundancy isn't correct.

Wait, perhaps the situation is that G2 is the TF, and both G1 and G3 are downstream of G2. But they function in parallel pathways, so their effects are additive. So without G2, both are non-functional, leading to 0% resistance.

In the double mutants, when G2 is present (like in g1g3), the resistance is additive. So 75% (g1) and 50% (g3), but the double is 10%—so perhaps 75% +50% is 125%, but the actual is 10%, which is the remaining from other factors.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's approach it differently.

The key points from the data:

- g2 is the most severe, 0%, so G2 is essential for any resistance.

- g1g2 and g2g3 are 0%, which shows that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. Because in the double mutants, the resistance is same as when G2 is knocked out.

Now, looking at the double mutants involving G1 and G3:

g1g3 is 10% resistance. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, even though G2 is present, resistance is very low.

Which suggests that G1 and G3 contribute to the resistance when G2 is present. So when G2 is present, G1 and G3 are active, and their combined presence contributes to higher resistance.

But when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, there's minimal resistance.

So, this suggests that G1 and G3 are both involved in the same pathway, but their effects are additive. So they might be working in parallel.

So, looking back at the options, which option says that G2 is the TF and that G1 and G3 are additive (not epistatic to each other)?

Looking at the options:

Option A: No, G1 is the TF.

Option B: G2 is TF, but G3 is epistatic to G1. So the double would be same as G3, which is 50%, but the actual is 10%. So no.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. I'm not sure about pleiotropy, but the epistasis doesn't fit.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. So redundancy would imply that the double mutant is same as either, but it's worse. So D is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Another approach is to figure out which options are incorrect.

Option B: G2 is a TF. That's correct. Now, G1 and G3 have the same promoter. How could that affect the data? If they have the same promoter, then knocking out G2 (the TF) would also knock out both G1 and G3. But in the data, the single mutant for g1 exists. So the promoter must be different. So option B is incorrect.

So the only correct option that has G2 as TF is either option C or D.

Between C and D, both have G2 as TF.

Option C says G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. I don't think that's the case here. Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits, but here, each contributes to the same trait (resistance), so perhaps not.

Option D: G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. As discussed earlier, the data doesn't fit because the double mutant is worse than either single. So redundancy isn't the case.

Wait, so maybe none of the options perfectly fit, but I have to pick the best one.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about the gene redundancy. Let me reconsider.

Gene redundancy is when two genes have overlapping functions, so their combined knockout leads to a more severe phenotype than either single. So in this case, the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either (75% and 50%). So this supports the idea that G1 and G3 are redundant. Because when both are knocked out, the phenotype is worse than either single.

Wait, but wait, no. Redundancy implies that each can perform the other's function. So if you have one, you're okay. If you lose both, then you have a problem. So the double mutant should be as bad as the worst single.

In our case, the double mutant is worse than the worst single (50% is worse than 10%). So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps they are not redundant but additive. So their combined effect is more than either.

So, in that case, G1 and G3 are not redundant but additive. So their combined knockout would result in a worse phenotype than either single.

But looking back at the options, which one describes this?

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, which isn't correct.

Option C says G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, which I'm not sure about. Alternatively, perhaps the question is leading towards G1 and G3 being in the same pathway, and their effects are additive.

Wait, the question states that at least one gene is a transcription factor. So perhaps G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are under its regulation.

So, the correct option must have G2 as the TF, and G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

Looking at the options again:

A) G1 is TF: incorrect.

B) G2 is TF. But says G3 is epistatic towards G1. Not matching.

C) G2 is TF. G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. Not sure. Also says G1 is epistatic towards G3: but data doesn't fit.

D) G2 is TF. G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. No, as discussed.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is none of the above, but since I have to choose, I'll think again.

Another approach: in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and their combined knockout leads to a more severe phenotype. So they are additive.

But the only option that has G2 as TF is options C and D.

Option C says G1 is epistatic to G3. If that were the case, in the double, it would be same as G1 (75%). But it's 10%, so that's not the case.

Option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. Same issue.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 are downstream, and G1 and G3 are additive. But none of the options directly state this.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option A.

Wait, option A says G1 is a TF, which can't be correct because g1 is only 75%—so G1's function isn't as critical as G2's, which is 0%.

So, the only option left that makes sense is option C.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about what each option is suggesting.

Option C: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy would mean that G1 affects multiple traits. But in our case, G1 and G3 are both contributing to the same trait (resistance). So maybe they're not pleiotropic. So option C is incorrect.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But as I thought earlier, the double mutant's 10% is worse than either single, so redundancy isn't correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the terms. Let me check what 'epistatic towards' means. If G1 is epistatic towards G3, then the phenotype of G3 is masked by G1. So in the double mutant, the phenotype would resemble G1.

But in our data, the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than G1's 75% and G3's 50%. So that's not the case. So C is incorrect.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about which options are possible based on the data.

The key points are:

- G2 is the TF because g2's resistance is 0%, the most severe.

- G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

- G1 and G3 are additive (their combined knockout is worse than either single).

So, looking for an option that states:

G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are additive (so their effects are not epistatic).

Looking at the options, none of them directly state that. But looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. But I'm not convinced.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. But again, the data doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I should think what each option implies about the double mutants.

Option C: G1 is epistatic towards G3. So when both are knocked out, the phenotype should be same as G1. But it's 10%, which is worse than G1. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: G1 is epistatic towards G3. Same reasoning, so incorrect.

So, perhaps the correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are additive. But looking at the options, which one includes this?

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Because G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. Maybe they're involved in other traits, but perhaps in this question, their effects are additive here.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, with G1 acting epistatic to G3. But in our case, the double mutant is 10%, which is worse than either.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A: G1 is a TF, but that doesn't fit the data because G1's single mutant is 75%, which isn't as severe as G2's 0%.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option C or D. But I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should think about what gene redundancy means. If G1 and G3 are redundant, their functions can compensate for each other. So, if G1 is knocked out, G3 can take over, and vice versa. But in the double mutant, both are knocked out, so the phenotype is worse than either single. Let's see:

In g1: 75% → G3 is present, so perhaps G3 can't fully compensate. So maybe the redundancy isn't complete.

In g3: 50% → G1 is present, but can't fully compensate.

So, in the double mutant, 10% → perhaps another gene is contributing, but it's not enough.

Hmm. So, perhaps G1 and G3 are partially redundant, but not fully. So in the absence of both, another gene contributes minimally.

But the options don't mention this. So, perhaps the correct answer is option D: gene redundancy, but since the data doesn't directly support it, I'm not sure.

Alternate approach: let's think about which options correctly model the phenotypes.

Option B: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic to G1.

Same promoter would mean that knocking out the TF (G2) would knock out both. But we have g1 and g3 as single mutants, so their promoters must be different. So option B is incorrect.

Option A: G1 is TF. No, because g1 is 75%, so can't be.

So, now the only remaining options are C and D.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

In the data, the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, worse than either. So if G1 is epistatic towards G3, the double should be like G1 (75%), but it's worse. So C is incorrect.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy would imply that the double mutant is the same as the worse single. But in this case, the double is worse than G3 (50% → 10%). So D is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the epistatic relationships again.

The double mutant g1g2 is 0%, same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G1.

The double mutant g2g3 is 0%, same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G3.

The double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either G1 (75%) or G3 (50%). So the effects are additive.

So, in this case, the G1 and G3 are additive, not epistatic.

So, looking for an option that says G2 is TF, and G1 and G3 are additive (no epistasis between them).

But none of the options directly state this. So perhaps the correct answer is option C or D.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is none of the options, but since I have to choose, I'll make a decision.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But I'm still not entirely confident.

Wait, another angle: The gene redundancy would mean that if either G1 or G3 is present, the function is okay. But if both are knocked out, the function is lost. But in this case, the double mutant is 10%, not 0%. So it's not gene redundancy.

So, perhaps the answer is option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, but I'm not convinced.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A: but that can't be because G2 is the TF.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 are additive, but the options don't directly state that.

Hmm, I'm really stuck. I think based on the data, the correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 function additively, and G2 is epistatic to both.

Looking at the options, option C says G2 is TF, G1 is epistatic towards G3. But data doesn't fit.

Option D: G2 is TF, gene redundancy between G1 and G3, but data doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is option A: but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Because they're additive, but since the only option that has G2 as TF is C and D, and I can't find a better fit, I'll have to make a choice.

Wait, another thought: The fact that g1g3 is 10% suggests that there's another gene contributing, say G4, which is activated by G2 but not by G1 or G3. So when G1 and G3 are knocked out, but G2 is present, G4 can only contribute 10%. So perhaps G1 and G3 are not directly under G2, but part of a network.

But regardless, the conclusion about the epistatic relationships must be made.

So, with all that, the best fit seems to be option D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is option C: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy (but I don't see how), and G1 is epistatic towards G3. But the data doesn't support epistasis between G1 and G3.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option C. No, I'm not convinced.

Wait, perhaps I should just choose option C.

Wait, looking back at the options, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

After all, the only thing that stands out is that G2 is the TF, so the correct option must have G2 as TF. The only options that have G2 as TF are B, C, and D. But I think option C is the only one that correctly places G2 as TF. Let me think.

Wait, no. Option B also says G2 is TF. So, perhaps option B is incorrect because of the other parts.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

I think I'm going in circles. Based on the data and the reasoning, the best conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. Also, the fact that the double mutant g1g3 is 10% suggests that G1 and G3 are additive.

Looking at the options, none say that G1 and G3 are additive. So perhaps the correct answer is option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is none of the above. But since I have to choose, I think option C is the closest.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about epistatic relationships.

Epistatic gene is the one whose product is upstream and thus masks the effect of the other gene.

So, if G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3, as shown by the double mutants, then G2 is upstream.

So, the only option that correctly identifies G2 as the TF is C and D. Now, looking at the other parts of the options.

Option C: G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. Not sure.

Option D: G1 and G3 show gene redundancy.

But the data suggests they are additive. So perhaps none of the options are correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm not sure.

I think I've thought this through as much as I can. Based on the data and reasoning, the correct answer is that G2 is a transcription factor, and G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. Among the options, the correct one is option C or D.

But I'm going to settle on option C: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but the data doesn't support G1 being epistatic towards G3. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But since I'm not fully confident, I'll make a choice.


The experiment investigates the interaction of three genes (G1, G2, G3) in white lupine resistance to anthracnose. The data shows resistance levels of single and double mutants compared to the wild-type control (100% resistance). Key findings include:

1. **Single mutants**:  
   - **g1**: 75% resistance, indicating G1 contributes to resistance.  
   - **g2**: 0% resistance, indicating G2 is essential for resistance.  
   - **g3**: 50% resistance, indicating G3 contributes but is less critical than G2.  

2. **Double mutants**:  
   - **g1g2**: 0% resistance, same as g2, showing G2 is epistatic to G1.  
   - **g1g3**: 10% resistance, worse than either single mutant, suggesting additive effects of G1 and G3.  
   - **g2g3**: 0% resistance, same as g2, showing G2 is epistatic to G3.  

From this, **G2 is identified as the transcription factor (TF)** because its knockout (g2) completely abolishes resistance (0%), and it is epistatic to both G1 and G3. The double mutant g1g3 (10%) indicates that G1 and G3 contribute additively to resistance when G2 is present.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. It claims G1 is the TF, but g1 has 75% resistance, indicating G1 is not essential for resistance.  
- **Option B**: Incorrect. While G2 is correctly identified as the TF, it claims G1 and G3 have the same promoter and G3 is epistatic to G1. The data does not support these claims.  
- **Option C**: Partially correct. G2 is correctly identified as the TF, and G1 and G3 show additive effects. However, the claim that G1 is epistatic to G3 is inconsistent with the data, as the double mutant g1g3 (10%) is worse than either single mutant.  
- **Option D**: Incorrect. While G2 is correctly identified as the TF, the claim of gene redundancy between G1 and G3 is inconsistent with the data. The double mutant g1g3 (10%) is worse than either single mutant, indicating additive, not redundant, effects.  

### Conclusion:
The best-supported conclusion is that **G2 is the transcription factor**, and G1 and G3 contribute additively to resistance when G2 is present. However, none of the options fully align with the data. Based on the reasoning provided, **Option C** is the closest, despite its inaccuracies regarding epistasis.
