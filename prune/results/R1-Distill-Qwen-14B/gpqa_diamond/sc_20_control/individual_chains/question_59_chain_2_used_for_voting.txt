Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. Hmm, that's a mix of an acid and a base. I remember that when an acid and a base are mixed, they can neutralize each other, so I'll probably need to figure out if there's excess acid or base after the reaction.

First, I think I should calculate the moles of each acid and base involved. Moles are calculated by Molarity multiplied by Volume (in liters). Let me write that down.

For CH3COOH (which is acetic acid, a weak acid):
Molarity (M) = 0.1 M
Volume (V) = 500 mL = 0.5 L
Moles = M * V = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles.

Wait, but wait. CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't completely dissociate. But when reacted with a strong base, like what's in Ba(OH)2, maybe the neutralization will proceed as if it were a strong acid? Or does the weak acid affect things? Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe I should proceed with considering their reaction.

Next, HCl is a strong acid. For HCl:
Molarity = 0.2 M
Volume = 400 mL = 0.4 L
Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles.

Then, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base as well. Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and OH^- ions. Each formula unit gives two OH^- ions. So for Ba(OH)2:
Molarity = 0.3 M
Volume = 300 mL = 0.3 L
Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles.
But since each mole gives two OH^-, the moles of OH^- is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles of OH^-.

Wait, but wait. OH^- is a strong base, so it will react with the acids present. So I need to figure out how much of each acid is neutralized by the OH^- from Ba(OH)2.

Wait, but HCl is a strong acid, and CH3COOH is a weak acid. So the OH^- will first neutralize the strong acid (HCl), then the weak acid (CH3COOH), right? Because strong acids are stronger in donating H+.

So, let me calculate the total moles of H+ from both acids, and then subtract the moles of OH^- to see what's left. Or, perhaps, it's better to think in terms of H+ and OH- neutralization.

Alternatively, I can consider all the H+ and OH- ions in the solution and see if there's an excess of either.

Wait, but let me think: the HCl will contribute H+ ions. CH3COOH will contribute some H+, but since it's weak, maybe not all of it. But when mixed with OH-, the neutralization reaction will be H+ + OH- → H2O.

But wait, because Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, all of its OH- will react with available H+ from the acids.

So, the total H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH. The OH- comes from Ba(OH)2.

I think the correct approach is:

1. Calculate moles of H+ from HCl and CH3COOH (but considering their dissociation).

Wait, no, because HCl is a strong acid and completely dissociates, so moles of H+ from HCl is 0.08 (since HCl → H+ + Cl^-). But CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't fully dissociate. However, when adding OH- (a strong base), the CH3COOH will react with the OH- as well.

Wait, maybe it's better to model each acid and base's contribution and then see the net.

So, let's think in terms of moles.

Total H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles.

Total H+ from CH3COOH: Let me see. CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it won't dissociate completely. But when OH- is added, it will deprotonate the acetic acid. So the OH- will react with both H+ from HCl and from CH3COOH.

But wait, when you have a solution with both a strong acid and a weak acid, adding OH- will first neutralize the strong acid (because it's more available), then the weak one.

So, moles of OH-: 0.18.

Moles of H+ (from HCl) is 0.08. So OH- will neutralize 0.08 H+ from HCl, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH-.

Then, the remaining OH- will react with CH3COOH. So the CH3COOH provides H+ which will react with the OH-.

But wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid, so when OH- is added, the reaction is:

CH3COOH + OH^- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So each mole of OH^- will consume one mole of CH3COOH and produce one mole of acetate ion.

So, the initial moles of CH3COOH are 0.05. The remaining OH- is 0.10.

So, 0.05 moles of CH3COOH can react with 0.05 moles of OH-.

After that, OH- left is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles.

So now, after all reactions, we have:

- 0.05 moles of CH3COO^- (from CH3COOH)
- 0.05 moles of OH- left (since 0.10 OH- neutralized 0.05 in CH3COOH)
Wait, but wait. Wait, the OH- after neutralizing HCl and then CH3COOH will determine whether we have excess acid or base.

Wait, so after neutralizing HCl's H+, we have 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 OH- left. Then, this 0.10 reacts with CH3COOH. The CH3COOH has 0.05 moles, so all of it will react, consuming 0.05 moles of OH-. So after that, we have 0.05 moles of OH- left.

Wait, but wait, let me re-verify.

HCl gives 0.08 H+. OH- is 0.18. So, OH- neutralizes H+ from HCl, leaving 0.18 -0.08=0.10 OH-.

Then, this OH- is neutralized by CH3COOH:

moles of OH- remaining: 0.10. moles of CH3COOH: 0.05. So, each mole of OH- consumes one mole of CH3COOH. So 0.05 moles of CH3COOH will react with 0.05 moles of OH-.

So, after that, the remaining OH- is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles. And the CH3COOH is all consumed, producing 0.05 moles of CH3COO^-.

So, the solution now has 0.05 moles of OH- in the total volume.

Wait, but wait, what about the other ions? Let me think about the total solution volume.

The total volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL, which is 1.2 L.

So, the concentration of OH- is 0.05 moles / 1.2 L = approx 0.0417 M.

Wait, but wait, if the solution has excess OH-, then the pH would be basic. But wait, let me think again about the calculations.

Wait, I think I messed up the neutralization steps.

Wait, let's recalculate the moles.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles HCl → 0.08 moles H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2 → each gives 2 moles OH-, so 0.18 moles OH-.

CH3COOH: 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles.

So, OH- neutralizes H+ from HCl first.

H+ from HCl: 0.08. OH-: 0.18.

So, H+ is 0.08, OH- is 0.18. So all H+ from HCl is neutralized, leaving OH- = 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10.

Then, the remaining OH- (0.10) will react with CH3COOH.

CH3COOH: 0.05 moles. Each mole of OH- reacts with one mole of CH3COOH.

So, 0.10 moles of OH- can react with 0.10 moles of CH3COOH, but we only have 0.05 available. So, all of the CH3COOH is consumed, and OH- is reduced by 0.05, leaving 0.05 moles of OH-.

So, after all reactions, we have:

- 0.05 moles of OH- left.
- The CH3COOH is all converted to acetate ions (CH3COO^-), 0.05 moles.
- The HCl is all neutralized.

So, the total volume is 1.2 L, so the concentration of OH- is 0.05 / 1.2 = approx 0.04167 M.

Then, pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38.

Wait, because pOH = -log[OH^-]. Let me calculate that.

0.04167 is approximately 4.167e-2. Let's compute the log:

log(4.167e-2) = log(4.167) + log(1e-2) ≈ 0.62 - 2 = -1.38 → so pOH is 1.38.

Then, pH = 14 - pOH = 14 -1.38 = 12.62.

Wait, but wait, that would give a pH of 12.62, which is option A. But let me think again: because acetic acid is a weak acid, does anything else happen here?

Wait, in this scenario, all the OH- has been consumed except for 0.05 moles in 1.2 L. So the solution is basic, and the excess OH- comes from the Ba(OH)2 after neutralizing both HCl and CH3COOH.

Wait, but wait. No, wait—the OH- is in excess, so the solution is basic. So the pH would be 12.62, which is option A.

But wait, another thought: what about the acetate ions? Since CH3COO^- is the conjugate base of a weak acid, it can hydrolyze in water to produce OH-.

So, perhaps I neglected the hydrolysis of acetate ions, which would contribute more OH- and increase the pH further.

Hmm, that complicates things. I didn't consider that.

Wait, in the solution, after neutralization, we have 0.05 moles of CH3COO^- and 0.05 moles of OH- from the excess. But wait, the acetate ions can hydrolyze:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

So this reaction would produce more OH- ions, increasing the concentration of OH- beyond what's left from the neutralization. So, the initial OH- is 0.05 moles, but the acetate will add more OH-.

So, this makes the problem a bit more involved. Because now, the solution has a common ion effect, but also the acetate hydrolysis contributes to OH-.

But how significant is this? Let me think.

The initial OH- is 0.05 moles in 1.2 L → 0.04167 M. The acetate is 0.05 moles in 1.2 L → 0.04167 M.

So, the concentration of acetate is 0.04167 M. The Kb for acetate can be calculated from the Ka of acetic acid.

Wait, the Ka of acetic acid (CH3COOH) is about 1.8 × 10^-5. So, the Kb for acetate would be Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.8e-5) ≈ 5.56e-10.

So, Kb is very small, which implies that the hydrolysis of acetate ions contributes little to the OH- concentration. So, perhaps I can neglect it.

Wait, but let me check.

The Kb is 5.56e-10, and the concentration of acetate is 0.04167 M.

Using the approximation for weak bases:

[OH^-] = sqrt(Kb * C) = sqrt(5.56e-10 * 0.04167) ≈ sqrt(2.3e-11) ≈ 4.8e-6 M.

So, [OH^-] ≈ 4.8e-6 M. Compare this to the initial [OH^-] from excess OH-: 0.04167 M.

The 4.8e-6 is much smaller than 0.04167, so the contribution from acetate hydrolysis is negligible. So, the initial calculation stands.

Therefore, the pH is determined by the excess OH- from Ba(OH)2, which gives pH ≈ 12.62, which is option A.

Wait, but wait another thing. What if the initial calculation is wrong? Let's recount the moles.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles.

Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Each mole gives 2 OH-, so 0.18 moles.

CH3COOH: 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05.

So, H+ from HCl is 0.08. OH- is 0.18.

OH- neutralizes H+: 0.08 H+ + 0.08 OH- → 0.08 H2O. Remaining OH-: 0.10.

Then, this 0.10 OH- reacts with CH3COOH, which is 0.05. So 0.05 CH3COOH + 0.05 OH- → 0.05 CH3COO^- + 0.05 H2O.

Remaining OH-: 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05.

So, 0.05 moles OH- in 1.2 L → 0.05/1.2 ~ 0.041667 M.

pOH = -log(0.041667) → Let me calculate that accurately.

0.041667 is 1/24, approximately. Log(24) is about 1.38.

So, log(0.041667) = log(1/24) = -log(24) ≈ -1.38.

So, pOH = 1.38 → pH = 14 -1.38 = 12.62. So, option A.

But wait, another thought: what about the dilution effect on the concentrations? Because all three solutions are mixed, the total volume is 1200 mL. So when calculating concentrations after mixing, I have to use 1.2 L.

Wait, but in the initial steps, I considered the moles, not the concentrations, which is correct because moles are additive.

So, the final moles of OH- are 0.05 in 1.2 L. So, 0.05 /1.2 = 0.0416667 M.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the pH is 12.62, which is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the neutralization reactions between the acids (HCl and CH3COOH) and the base (Ba(OH)2). The steps are as follows:

1. **Calculate moles of each substance:**
   - **HCl (strong acid):**  
     Moles = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{moles of H}^+ \).
   - **CH3COOH (weak acid):**  
     Moles = \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{moles} \).
   - **Ba(OH)2 (strong base):**  
     Moles of Ba(OH)2 = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Each mole of Ba(OH)2 produces 2 moles of OH\(^-\), so moles of OH\(^-\) = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles} \).

2. **Neutralization reactions:**
   - OH\(^-\) reacts first with the strong acid (HCl):  
     \( 0.08 \, \text{moles of H}^+ + 0.08 \, \text{moles of OH}^- \to 0.08 \, \text{moles of H}_2\text{O} \).  
     Remaining OH\(^-\): \( 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{moles} \).
   - The remaining OH\(^-\) reacts with the weak acid (CH3COOH):  
     \( 0.05 \, \text{moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} + 0.05 \, \text{moles of OH}^- \to 0.05 \, \text{moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- + 0.05 \, \text{moles of H}_2\text{O} \).  
     Remaining OH\(^-\): \( 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{moles} \).

3. **Determine the concentration of OH\(^-\):**
   - Total volume of the solution = \( 500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L} \).  
   - Concentration of OH\(^-\):  
     \[
     [\text{OH}^-] = \frac{\text{moles of OH}^-}{\text{volume of solution}} = \frac{0.05}{1.2} \approx 0.04167 \, \text{M}.
     \]

4. **Calculate pOH and pH:**
   - pOH = \(-\log[\text{OH}^-]\):  
     \[
     \text{pOH} = -\log(0.04167) \approx 1.38.
     \]
   - pH = \( 14 - \text{pOH} \):  
     \[
     \text{pH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.
     \]

5. **Consideration of acetate hydrolysis:**
   - CH3COO\(^-\) (produced from CH3COOH) can hydrolyze to produce OH\(^-\):  
     \[
     \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
     \]
   - The \( K_b \) for acetate is very small (\( K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1 \times 10^{-14}}{1.8 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.56 \times 10^{-10} \)), so the contribution of OH\(^-\) from acetate hydrolysis is negligible compared to the excess OH\(^-\) from Ba(OH)2.

Thus, the pH of the solution is determined by the excess OH\(^-\) from Ba(OH)2, giving a final pH of approximately 12.62.

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. Hmm, that's a mix of an acid and a base. I remember that when an acid and a base are mixed, they can neutralize each other, so I'll probably need to figure out if there's excess acid or base after the reaction.

First, I think I should calculate the moles of each acid and base involved. Moles are calculated by Molarity multiplied by Volume (in liters). Let me write that down.

For CH3COOH (which is acetic acid, a weak acid):
Molarity (M) = 0.1 M
Volume (V) = 500 mL = 0.5 L
Moles = M * V = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles.

Wait, but wait. CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't completely dissociate. But when reacted with a strong base, like what's in Ba(OH)2, maybe the neutralization will proceed as if it were a strong acid? Or does the weak acid affect things? Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe I should proceed with considering their reaction.

Next, HCl is a strong acid. For HCl:
Molarity = 0.2 M
Volume = 400 mL = 0.4 L
Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles.

Then, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base as well. Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and OH^- ions. Each formula unit gives two OH^- ions. So for Ba(OH)2:
Molarity = 0.3 M
Volume = 300 mL = 0.3 L
Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles.
But since each mole gives two OH^-, the moles of OH^- is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles of OH^-.

Wait, but wait. OH^- is a strong base, so it will react with the acids present. So I need to figure out how much of each acid is neutralized by the OH^- from Ba(OH)2.

Wait, but HCl is a strong acid, and CH3COOH is a weak acid. So the OH^- will first neutralize the strong acid (HCl), then the weak acid (CH3COOH), right? Because strong acids are stronger in donating H+.

So, let me calculate the total moles of H+ from both acids, and then subtract the moles of OH^- to see what's left. Or, perhaps, it's better to think in terms of H+ and OH- neutralization.

Alternatively, I can consider all the H+ and OH- ions in the solution and see if there's an excess of either.

Wait, but let me think: the HCl will contribute H+ ions. CH3COOH will contribute some H+, but since it's weak, maybe not all of it. But when mixed with OH-, the neutralization reaction will be H+ + OH- → H2O.

But wait, because Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, all of its OH- will react with available H+ from the acids.

So, the total H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH. The OH- comes from Ba(OH)2.

I think the correct approach is:

1. Calculate moles of H+ from HCl and CH3COOH (but considering their dissociation).

Wait, no, because HCl is a strong acid and completely dissociates, so moles of H+ from HCl is 0.08 (since HCl → H+ + Cl^-). But CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't fully dissociate. However, when adding OH- (a strong base), the CH3COOH will react with the OH- as well.

Wait, maybe it's better to model each acid and base's contribution and then see the net.

So, let's think in terms of moles.

Total H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles.

Total H+ from CH3COOH: Let me see. CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it won't dissociate completely. But when OH- is added, it will deprotonate the acetic acid. So the OH- will react with both H+ from HCl and from CH3COOH.

But wait, when you have a solution with both a strong acid and a weak acid, adding OH- will first neutralize the strong acid (because it's more available), then the weak one.

So, moles of OH-: 0.18.

Moles of H+ (from HCl) is 0.08. So OH- will neutralize 0.08 H+ from HCl, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH-.

Then, the remaining OH- will react with CH3COOH. So the CH3COOH provides H+ which will react with the OH-.

But wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid, so when OH- is added, the reaction is:

CH3COOH + OH^- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So each mole of OH^- will consume one mole of CH3COOH and produce one mole of acetate ion.

So, the initial moles of CH3COOH are 0.05. The remaining OH- is 0.10.

So, 0.05 moles of CH3COOH can react with 0.05 moles of OH-.

After that, OH- left is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles.

So now, after all reactions, we have:

- 0.05 moles of CH3COO^- (from CH3COOH)
- 0.05 moles of OH- left (since 0.10 OH- neutralized 0.05 in CH3COOH)
Wait, but wait. Wait, the OH- after neutralizing HCl and then CH3COOH will determine whether we have excess acid or base.

Wait, so after neutralizing HCl's H+, we have 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 OH- left. Then, this 0.10 reacts with CH3COOH. The CH3COOH has 0.05 moles, so all of it will react, consuming 0.05 moles of OH-. So after that, we have 0.05 moles of OH- left.

Wait, but wait, let me re-verify.

HCl gives 0.08 H+. OH- is 0.18. So, OH- neutralizes H+ from HCl, leaving 0.18 -0.08=0.10 OH-.

Then, this OH- is neutralized by CH3COOH:

moles of OH- remaining: 0.10. moles of CH3COOH: 0.05. So, each mole of OH- consumes one mole of CH3COOH. So 0.05 moles of CH3COOH will react with 0.05 moles of OH-.

So, after that, the remaining OH- is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles. And the CH3COOH is all consumed, producing 0.05 moles of CH3COO^-.

So, the solution now has 0.05 moles of OH- in the total volume.

Wait, but wait, what about the other ions? Let me think about the total solution volume.

The total volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL, which is 1.2 L.

So, the concentration of OH- is 0.05 moles / 1.2 L = approx 0.0417 M.

Wait, but wait, if the solution has excess OH-, then the pH would be basic. But wait, let me think again about the calculations.

Wait, I think I messed up the neutralization steps.

Wait, let's recalculate the moles.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles HCl → 0.08 moles H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2 → each gives 2 moles OH-, so 0.18 moles OH-.

CH3COOH: 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles.

So, OH- neutralizes H+ from HCl first.

H+ from HCl: 0.08. OH-: 0.18.

So, H+ is 0.08, OH- is 0.18. So all H+ from HCl is neutralized, leaving OH- = 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10.

Then, the remaining OH- (0.10) will react with CH3COOH.

CH3COOH: 0.05 moles. Each mole of OH- reacts with one mole of CH3COOH.

So, 0.10 moles of OH- can react with 0.10 moles of CH3COOH, but we only have 0.05 available. So, all of the CH3COOH is consumed, and OH- is reduced by 0.05, leaving 0.05 moles of OH-.

So, after all reactions, we have:

- 0.05 moles of OH- left.
- The CH3COOH is all converted to acetate ions (CH3COO^-), 0.05 moles.
- The HCl is all neutralized.

So, the total volume is 1.2 L, so the concentration of OH- is 0.05 / 1.2 = approx 0.04167 M.

Then, pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38.

Wait, because pOH = -log[OH^-]. Let me calculate that.

0.04167 is approximately 4.167e-2. Let's compute the log:

log(4.167e-2) = log(4.167) + log(1e-2) ≈ 0.62 - 2 = -1.38 → so pOH is 1.38.

Then, pH = 14 - pOH = 14 -1.38 = 12.62.

Wait, but wait, that would give a pH of 12.62, which is option A. But let me think again: because acetic acid is a weak acid, does anything else happen here?

Wait, in this scenario, all the OH- has been consumed except for 0.05 moles in 1.2 L. So the solution is basic, and the excess OH- comes from the Ba(OH)2 after neutralizing both HCl and CH3COOH.

Wait, but wait. No, wait—the OH- is in excess, so the solution is basic. So the pH would be 12.62, which is option A.

But wait, another thought: what about the acetate ions? Since CH3COO^- is the conjugate base of a weak acid, it can hydrolyze in water to produce OH-.

So, perhaps I neglected the hydrolysis of acetate ions, which would contribute more OH- and increase the pH further.

Hmm, that complicates things. I didn't consider that.

Wait, in the solution, after neutralization, we have 0.05 moles of CH3COO^- and 0.05 moles of OH- from the excess. But wait, the acetate ions can hydrolyze:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

So this reaction would produce more OH- ions, increasing the concentration of OH- beyond what's left from the neutralization. So, the initial OH- is 0.05 moles, but the acetate will add more OH-.

So, this makes the problem a bit more involved. Because now, the solution has a common ion effect, but also the acetate hydrolysis contributes to OH-.

But how significant is this? Let me think.

The initial OH- is 0.05 moles in 1.2 L → 0.04167 M. The acetate is 0.05 moles in 1.2 L → 0.04167 M.

So, the concentration of acetate is 0.04167 M. The Kb for acetate can be calculated from the Ka of acetic acid.

Wait, the Ka of acetic acid (CH3COOH) is about 1.8 × 10^-5. So, the Kb for acetate would be Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.8e-5) ≈ 5.56e-10.

So, Kb is very small, which implies that the hydrolysis of acetate ions contributes little to the OH- concentration. So, perhaps I can neglect it.

Wait, but let me check.

The Kb is 5.56e-10, and the concentration of acetate is 0.04167 M.

Using the approximation for weak bases:

[OH^-] = sqrt(Kb * C) = sqrt(5.56e-10 * 0.04167) ≈ sqrt(2.3e-11) ≈ 4.8e-6 M.

So, [OH^-] ≈ 4.8e-6 M. Compare this to the initial [OH^-] from excess OH-: 0.04167 M.

The 4.8e-6 is much smaller than 0.04167, so the contribution from acetate hydrolysis is negligible. So, the initial calculation stands.

Therefore, the pH is determined by the excess OH- from Ba(OH)2, which gives pH ≈ 12.62, which is option A.

Wait, but wait another thing. What if the initial calculation is wrong? Let's recount the moles.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles.

Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Each mole gives 2 OH-, so 0.18 moles.

CH3COOH: 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05.

So, H+ from HCl is 0.08. OH- is 0.18.

OH- neutralizes H+: 0.08 H+ + 0.08 OH- → 0.08 H2O. Remaining OH-: 0.10.

Then, this 0.10 OH- reacts with CH3COOH, which is 0.05. So 0.05 CH3COOH + 0.05 OH- → 0.05 CH3COO^- + 0.05 H2O.

Remaining OH-: 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05.

So, 0.05 moles OH- in 1.2 L → 0.05/1.2 ~ 0.041667 M.

pOH = -log(0.041667) → Let me calculate that accurately.

0.041667 is 1/24, approximately. Log(24) is about 1.38.

So, log(0.041667) = log(1/24) = -log(24) ≈ -1.38.

So, pOH = 1.38 → pH = 14 -1.38 = 12.62. So, option A.

But wait, another thought: what about the dilution effect on the concentrations? Because all three solutions are mixed, the total volume is 1200 mL. So when calculating concentrations after mixing, I have to use 1.2 L.

Wait, but in the initial steps, I considered the moles, not the concentrations, which is correct because moles are additive.

So, the final moles of OH- are 0.05 in 1.2 L. So, 0.05 /1.2 = 0.0416667 M.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the pH is 12.62, which is option A.


To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the neutralization reactions between the acids (HCl and CH3COOH) and the base (Ba(OH)2). The steps are as follows:

1. **Calculate moles of each substance:**
   - **HCl (strong acid):**  
     Moles = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{moles of H}^+ \).
   - **CH3COOH (weak acid):**  
     Moles = \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{moles} \).
   - **Ba(OH)2 (strong base):**  
     Moles of Ba(OH)2 = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Each mole of Ba(OH)2 produces 2 moles of OH\(^-\), so moles of OH\(^-\) = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles} \).

2. **Neutralization reactions:**
   - OH\(^-\) reacts first with the strong acid (HCl):  
     \( 0.08 \, \text{moles of H}^+ + 0.08 \, \text{moles of OH}^- \to 0.08 \, \text{moles of H}_2\text{O} \).  
     Remaining OH\(^-\): \( 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{moles} \).
   - The remaining OH\(^-\) reacts with the weak acid (CH3COOH):  
     \( 0.05 \, \text{moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} + 0.05 \, \text{moles of OH}^- \to 0.05 \, \text{moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- + 0.05 \, \text{moles of H}_2\text{O} \).  
     Remaining OH\(^-\): \( 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{moles} \).

3. **Determine the concentration of OH\(^-\):**
   - Total volume of the solution = \( 500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L} \).  
   - Concentration of OH\(^-\):  
     \[
     [\text{OH}^-] = \frac{\text{moles of OH}^-}{\text{volume of solution}} = \frac{0.05}{1.2} \approx 0.04167 \, \text{M}.
     \]

4. **Calculate pOH and pH:**
   - pOH = \(-\log[\text{OH}^-]\):  
     \[
     \text{pOH} = -\log(0.04167) \approx 1.38.
     \]
   - pH = \( 14 - \text{pOH} \):  
     \[
     \text{pH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.
     \]

5. **Consideration of acetate hydrolysis:**
   - CH3COO\(^-\) (produced from CH3COOH) can hydrolyze to produce OH\(^-\):  
     \[
     \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
     \]
   - The \( K_b \) for acetate is very small (\( K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1 \times 10^{-14}}{1.8 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.56 \times 10^{-10} \)), so the contribution of OH\(^-\) from acetate hydrolysis is negligible compared to the excess OH\(^-\) from Ba(OH)2.

Thus, the pH of the solution is determined by the excess OH\(^-\) from Ba(OH)2, giving a final pH of approximately 12.62.
