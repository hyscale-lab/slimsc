Okay, so I have this question about transit probabilities of two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to choose which one to observe based on the higher probability of a transit. Let me try to break this down.

First, I remember that the transit method depends on the planet passing in front of its star from our point of view. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the star and the planet's orbit. A larger star makes the transit less likely because the planet's path has a smaller chance of crossing our line of sight. Also, a larger orbital distance increases the chance because the planet's orbital plane is more likely to edge-on, I think.

The question says both planets have the same mass, but different orbital periods. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Since the period is shorter, that means Planet_1 is closer to its star, right? Because from Kepler's third law, a shorter period implies a smaller orbit.

Wait, Kepler's third law formula is P² = (4π²/G(M+m)) * a³. Since the mass of the planet is much smaller than the star, M is approximately the star's mass. So P² is proportional to a³/(M), where M is the star's mass. So for the same M, if P is smaller, a is smaller. But in this case, the two stars have different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. So let me think about the semi-major axes of the two planets.

Let me denote the orbital period of Planet_2 as P. Then Planet_1's period is P/3. The masses of their stars are M1 = 2M2. Let me write the Kepler's law for both:

For Planet_1: (P1)^2 = (4π²/(G*M1)) * a1³
So ( (P/3) )^2 = (4π²/(G*2M2)) * a1³

For Planet_2: P² = (4π²/(G*M2)) * a2³

Hmm, maybe I can take the ratio to find a1/a2. Let me divide the two equations:

( (P/3)^2 ) / ( P^2 ) = [ (4π²/(G*2M2)) * a1³ ] / [ (4π²/(G*M2)) * a2³ ] 

Simplify left side: (P²/9)/(P²) )= 1/9.

Right side: [ (1/(2M2)) * a1³ ] / [ (1/M2) * a2³ ] = (a1³)/(2 a2³ )

So 1/9 = (a1³)/(2 a2³ )

Multiply both sides by 2 a2³:

(2 a2³ ) * 1/9 = a1³ 

So a1³ = (2/9) a2³ 

Take cube roots: a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3)

Wait, 2/9 is about 0.222, so cube root is around 0.6. But maybe I should keep it symbolic.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express a1 in terms of a2.

From the equation, (a1³)/(a2³) = 2/(9) 

So a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) = cube root of (2/9) = approximately 0.63. So Planet_1's semi-major axis is about 0.63 times that of Planet_2.

Wait, but wait. So Planet_1 is closer to its star than Planet_2 is to theirs. Because a1 is smaller than a2.

But how does that affect the transit probability?

The transit probability depends on the relative size of the planet's orbit and the star's size. Oh, wait, I think the probability is roughly proportional to (R_star / a) because the area where the planet can be in front is a circle with radius a, and the star is of radius R. So the probability P is approximately (R_star) / (a * (1 - (R_star / a))^{1/2} ), but I'm not exactly sure about the formula. Wait, I remember that the transit probability is given by (R_star + R_planet) / a, but considering that R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's roughly R_star / a.

Wait, no, wait. The probability of transit is higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on. The probability is roughly (R_star / a), but perhaps it's (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since R_planet is much smaller, it's R_star/a multiplied by some function of the inclination distribution. Oh right, the correct formula for the transit probability is (R_star / a) * (1/(sqrt(1 - (R_star / a)^2)) )) ? No, I'm not confident.

Alternatively, I remember that the transit probability (P) is approximately the area of the star (π R_star²) divided by the area of the planet's orbit (π a²), but that might not be correct because it's a 3D geometry problem. Wait, I think the probability is given by (R_star / a) * (1 / sqrt(1 - (R_star / a)^2 )) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the probability is given by (R_star / a) multiplied by 1 / (sqrt(1 - (R_star/a)^2)), but perhaps that's not the right approach.

Wait, perhaps better to think in terms of the solid angle. The probability of transit is the ratio of the star's disk area to the area of the sphere as seen from Earth. Hmm, but I might be complicating it. Alternatively, I remember that the transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a) when R_star << a. Because the planet has to pass within a small cone of the star's disk.

Wait, maybe the formula I should use is P ≈ (R_star / a), but that's an approximation. Because when the star is much smaller than the orbital distance, the area where the planet can transit is roughly the star's area compared to the planet's orbital area. But for more precise calculations, it's (R_star + R_planet) / a, but as R_planet is negligible, it's R_star/a.

Wait, but the question mentions that both host stars have the same radii. Because the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved but same radius. So R1 = R2.

So if R1 = R2, then the transit probability is proportional to (R/a), so since R is same, it's inversely proportional to a. So a smaller a (closer planet) has a higher transit probability.

Wait, Planet_1 has a shorter period, so a1 is smaller, so R1/a1 is larger, leading to higher probability.

But wait, the stars have same radii but different masses. Wait, but the transit probability only depends on the star's radius and the planet's orbital distance, a. So since R is same for both, but a1 is smaller, the probability for Planet_1 is higher.

But let me get back to the Kepler's law stuff to find a1 and a2.

Earlier, we found that a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3). Let me compute that cube root. 2/9 is approximately 0.222. The cube root of 0.222 is approximately 0.6, since 0.6^3 = 0.216. So a1 is about 0.6 times a2.

So for a1, it's 0.6a2.

So the transit probability is proportional to R/(a). Since R is same for both, the probability for Planet_1 is R/(0.6a2) and for Planet_2 is R/(a2). So the ratio of P1 to P2 is (R/(0.6 a2)) / (R/(a2)) ) = 1/(0.6) = 5/3 ≈ 1.666... So about 1.666 times higher for Planet_1.

So Planet_1 has a higher probability. So the researchers should prefer observing Planet_1.

Looking at the options:

Option C) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D) 2.7 times, which is higher.

Wait, but wait, maybe my assumption about the transit probability being (R/a) is incorrect. Let me double-check the actual formula.

The transit probability (P) can be approximated as (R_star / a) multiplied by 1 / (sqrt(1 - (R_star / a)^2)) ), but that might be for a specific calculation.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability is the ratio of the star's diameter to the planet's orbital diameter, which is (2R_star)/(2a) = R_star/a. So the approximate probability is (R_star / a). Since R is same for both, and a1 is smaller, the probability for Planet_1 is higher.

But wait, we had a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) a2 ≈ 0.6a2. So P1 = R/(0.6a2) = (1/0.6) * (R/a2) = (5/3) * P2. So P1 is 5/3 times P2, which is about 1.666 times higher. So that's approximately 1.65 times, which matches option C.

So the researchers would choose Planet_1, which is option C or D. Option C says 1.65 times higher, which aligns with 5/3 (~1.666). So the answer should be option C.

Wait, but I thought earlier that the transit probability increases when a is smaller. So if P1 is about 1.65 times higher, they should observe Planet_1, which is option C.

Looking back at the options:

Option C: Planet_1 preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D: Planet_1 preferred due to ~2.7 times higher.

So based on our calculation, the correct option is C.

To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula. The transit probability \( P \) is approximately proportional to \( \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a} \), where \( R_{\text{star}} \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both planets orbit stars with the same radius (\( R_1 = R_2 \)), the probability depends inversely on the orbital distance \( a \). A smaller \( a \) results in a higher transit probability.

From Kepler's third law, the orbital period \( P \) is related to the semi-major axis \( a \) and the host star's mass \( M \) by:

\[
P^2 \propto \frac{a^3}{M}.
\]

For Planet_1, the orbital period is \( \frac{P_2}{3} \), and the host star's mass is \( 2M_2 \). For Planet_2, the orbital period is \( P_2 \), and the host star's mass is \( M_2 \). Taking the ratio of the two equations:

\[
\left(\frac{P_1}{P_2}\right)^2 = \frac{\frac{a_1^3}{2M_2}}{\frac{a_2^3}{M_2}},
\]

\[
\left(\frac{P_1}{P_2}\right)^2 = \frac{a_1^3}{2a_2^3}.
\]

Substituting \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \):

\[
\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{a_1^3}{2a_2^3}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\frac{1}{9} = \frac{a_1^3}{2a_2^3},
\]

\[
a_1^3 = \frac{2}{9}a_2^3,
\]

\[
a_1 = a_2 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

The cube root of \( \frac{2}{9} \) is approximately \( 0.6 \), so \( a_1 \approx 0.6a_2 \). Since the transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), the ratio of the transit probabilities is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R}{a_1}}{\frac{R}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{a_2}{0.6a_2} = \frac{1}{0.6} \approx 1.67.
\]

Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. The researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.

**Option Analysis:**

- **A)** Incorrect. Planet_2 does not have a higher transit probability.
- **B)** Incorrect. Planet_2's transit probability is not 1.5 times higher.
- **C)** Correct. Planet_1 has a transit probability approximately 1.65 times higher than Planet_2.
- **D)** Incorrect. The transit probability ratio is not 2.7 times.

Okay, so I have this question about transit probabilities of two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to choose which one to observe based on the higher probability of a transit. Let me try to break this down.

First, I remember that the transit method depends on the planet passing in front of its star from our point of view. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the star and the planet's orbit. A larger star makes the transit less likely because the planet's path has a smaller chance of crossing our line of sight. Also, a larger orbital distance increases the chance because the planet's orbital plane is more likely to edge-on, I think.

The question says both planets have the same mass, but different orbital periods. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Since the period is shorter, that means Planet_1 is closer to its star, right? Because from Kepler's third law, a shorter period implies a smaller orbit.

Wait, Kepler's third law formula is P² = (4π²/G(M+m)) * a³. Since the mass of the planet is much smaller than the star, M is approximately the star's mass. So P² is proportional to a³/(M), where M is the star's mass. So for the same M, if P is smaller, a is smaller. But in this case, the two stars have different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. So let me think about the semi-major axes of the two planets.

Let me denote the orbital period of Planet_2 as P. Then Planet_1's period is P/3. The masses of their stars are M1 = 2M2. Let me write the Kepler's law for both:

For Planet_1: (P1)^2 = (4π²/(G*M1)) * a1³
So ( (P/3) )^2 = (4π²/(G*2M2)) * a1³

For Planet_2: P² = (4π²/(G*M2)) * a2³

Hmm, maybe I can take the ratio to find a1/a2. Let me divide the two equations:

( (P/3)^2 ) / ( P^2 ) = [ (4π²/(G*2M2)) * a1³ ] / [ (4π²/(G*M2)) * a2³ ] 

Simplify left side: (P²/9)/(P²) )= 1/9.

Right side: [ (1/(2M2)) * a1³ ] / [ (1/M2) * a2³ ] = (a1³)/(2 a2³ )

So 1/9 = (a1³)/(2 a2³ )

Multiply both sides by 2 a2³:

(2 a2³ ) * 1/9 = a1³ 

So a1³ = (2/9) a2³ 

Take cube roots: a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3)

Wait, 2/9 is about 0.222, so cube root is around 0.6. But maybe I should keep it symbolic.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express a1 in terms of a2.

From the equation, (a1³)/(a2³) = 2/(9) 

So a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) = cube root of (2/9) = approximately 0.63. So Planet_1's semi-major axis is about 0.63 times that of Planet_2.

Wait, but wait. So Planet_1 is closer to its star than Planet_2 is to theirs. Because a1 is smaller than a2.

But how does that affect the transit probability?

The transit probability depends on the relative size of the planet's orbit and the star's size. Oh, wait, I think the probability is roughly proportional to (R_star / a) because the area where the planet can be in front is a circle with radius a, and the star is of radius R. So the probability P is approximately (R_star) / (a * (1 - (R_star / a))^{1/2} ), but I'm not exactly sure about the formula. Wait, I remember that the transit probability is given by (R_star + R_planet) / a, but considering that R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's roughly R_star / a.

Wait, no, wait. The probability of transit is higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on. The probability is roughly (R_star / a), but perhaps it's (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since R_planet is much smaller, it's R_star/a multiplied by some function of the inclination distribution. Oh right, the correct formula for the transit probability is (R_star / a) * (1/(sqrt(1 - (R_star / a)^2)) )) ? No, I'm not confident.

Alternatively, I remember that the transit probability (P) is approximately the area of the star (π R_star²) divided by the area of the planet's orbit (π a²), but that might not be correct because it's a 3D geometry problem.

Wait, but the question mentions that both host stars have the same radii. Because the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved but same radius. So R1 = R2.

So if R1 = R2, then the transit probability is proportional to (R/a), so since R is same, it's inversely proportional to a. So a smaller a (closer planet) has a higher transit probability.

Wait, Planet_1 has a shorter period, so a1 is smaller, so R1/a1 is larger, leading to higher probability.

But wait, the stars have same radii but different masses. Wait, but the transit probability only depends on the star's radius and the planet's orbital distance, a. So since R is same for both, but a1 is smaller, the probability for Planet_1 is higher.

But let me get back to the Kepler's law stuff to find a1 and a2.

Earlier, we found that a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3). Let me compute that cube root. 2/9 is approximately 0.222. The cube root of 0.222 is approximately 0.6, since 0.6^3 = 0.216. So a1 is about 0.6 times a2.

So for a1, it's 0.6a2.

So the transit probability is proportional to R/(a). Since R is same for both, the probability for Planet_1 is R/(0.6a2) and for Planet_2 is R/(a2). So the ratio of P1 to P2 is (R/(0.6 a2)) / (R/(a2)) ) = 1/(0.6) = 5/3 ≈ 1.666... So about 1.666 times higher for Planet_1.

So Planet_1 has a higher probability. So the researchers should prefer observing Planet_1.

Looking at the options:

Option C) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D) 2.7 times, which is higher.

Wait, but wait, maybe my assumption about the transit probability being (R/a) is incorrect. Let me double-check the actual formula.

The transit probability (P) can be approximated as (R_star / a) multiplied by 1 / (sqrt(1 - (R_star / a)^2)) ), but that might be for a specific calculation.

But wait, we had a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) a2 ≈ 0.6a2. So P1 = R/(0.6a2) = (1/0.6) * (R/a2) = (5/3) * P2. So P1 is 5/3 times P2, which is about 1.666 times higher. So that's approximately 1.65 times, which matches option C.

So the researchers would choose Planet_1, which is option C or D. Option C says 1.65 times higher, which aligns with 5/3 (~1.666). So the answer should be option C.

Wait, but I thought earlier that the transit probability increases when a is smaller. So if P1 is about 1.65 times higher, they should observe Planet_1, which is option C.

Looking back at the options:

Option C: Planet_1 preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D: Planet_1 preferred due to ~2.7 times higher.

So based on our calculation, the correct option is C.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula. The transit probability \( P \) is approximately proportional to \( \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a} \), where \( R_{\text{star}} \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both planets orbit stars with the same radius (\( R_1 = R_2 \)), the probability depends inversely on the orbital distance \( a \). A smaller \( a \) results in a higher transit probability.

From Kepler's third law, the orbital period \( P \) is related to the semi-major axis \( a \) and the host star's mass \( M \) by:

\[
P^2 \propto \frac{a^3}{M}.
\]

For Planet_1, the orbital period is \( \frac{P_2}{3} \), and the host star's mass is \( 2M_2 \). For Planet_2, the orbital period is \( P_2 \), and the host star's mass is \( M_2 \). Taking the ratio of the two equations:

\[
\left(\frac{P_1}{P_2}\right)^2 = \frac{\frac{a_1^3}{2M_2}}{\frac{a_2^3}{M_2}},
\]

\[
\left(\frac{P_1}{P_2}\right)^2 = \frac{a_1^3}{2a_2^3}.
\]

Substituting \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \):

\[
\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{a_1^3}{2a_2^3}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\frac{1}{9} = \frac{a_1^3}{2a_2^3},
\]

\[
a_1^3 = \frac{2}{9}a_2^3,
\]

\[
a_1 = a_2 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

The cube root of \( \frac{2}{9} \) is approximately \( 0.6 \), so \( a_1 \approx 0.6a_2 \). Since the transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), the ratio of the transit probabilities is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R}{a_1}}{\frac{R}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{a_2}{0.6a_2} = \frac{1}{0.6} \approx 1.67.
\]

Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. The researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.

**Option Analysis:**

- **A)** Incorrect. Planet_2 does not have a higher transit probability.
- **B)** Incorrect. Planet_2's transit probability is not 1.5 times higher.
- **C)** Correct. Planet_1 has a transit probability approximately 1.65 times higher than Planet_2.
- **D)** Incorrect. The transit probability ratio is not 2.7 times.

Answer: C
