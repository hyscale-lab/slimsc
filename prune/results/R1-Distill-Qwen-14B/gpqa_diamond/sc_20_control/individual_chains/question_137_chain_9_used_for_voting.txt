Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I remember that cyclotrons and synchrocyclotrons are types of particle accelerators. The main difference is that cyclotrons have a constant magnetic field, while synchrocyclotrons vary the field over time to keep the particles in sync with the accelerating voltage. But wait, I'm not entirely sure about that. Maybe I should double-check that.

The problem says a proton is injected with negligible kinetic energy at t=0, so T is approximately zero. It undergoes two accelerations and reaches a kinetic energy T1 of 950 MeV. The question is about how many revolutions the proton makes in the synchrocyclotron.

The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. The data provided is Φ0 = π/4 and U0 = 190 kV.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the function ν(α). Oh, right, in a synchrocyclotron, the frequency ν changes with the radius of the particle's path because as the particle gains energy, its mass effectively increases (relativistically), so the cyclotron frequency changes. The frequency ν is a function of the particle's momentum, which depends on the kinetic energy.

But I'm not exactly sure how to approach finding the number of revolutions. Let me think. The number of revolutions N should be related to the time the proton spends in the accelerator and the frequency at which it revolves.

In a cyclotron, the time for one revolution is the period T = (2π m)/(q B), where m is the mass, q the charge, and B the magnetic field. But in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field increases as the particle's momentum increases, so the frequency ν(t) isn't constant. Oh wait, no, wait. Synchrocyclotrons actually vary the frequency to match the changing momentum. So the accelerating voltage is synchronized with the particle's motion.

Wait, but the formula given for U(t) is a cosine function with a frequency that's a function of α, which I'm not sure about. Oh, wait, in synchrocyclotrons, the frequency ν is adjusted as the particle gains energy. The idea is that the particle's motion is such that it's always in phase with the accelerating voltage.

The kinetic energy is given as 950 MeV. The initial kinetic energy is negligible, so the final energy is 950 MeV. I think I need to find the number of times the proton goes around the synchrocyclotron before it reaches that energy.

I remember that in cyclotrons, the time for each revolution increases as the radius increases because the magnetic field is constant, but in synchrocyclotrons, the magnetic field increases to keep the cyclotron frequency matched with the radiofrequency (RF) system. Alternatively, maybe the frequency ν is adjusted to match the relativistic effects on the particle's mass.

Wait, the problem says the proton undergoes two accelerations. Oh wait, perhaps that's a typo or a misunderstanding. Maybe it's two applications of the voltage, but I'm not sure. Each acceleration refers to each time the proton is accelerated by the voltage as it goes around the synchrocyclotron. So each time it completes a half-cycle (like in a cyclotron), it gets a kick from the electric field.

Wait, in a cyclotron, the particles are accelerated twice per revolution because the electric field changes direction each half-period. So each time the particle passes through the gap, it gets a push. So each revolution leads to two accelerations. But the problem says the proton undergoes two accelerations to reach T1=950 MeV. Hmm, but that might not be directly relevant here.

Wait, maybe the problem is using "acceleration" to mean the entire process. Maybe each time the voltage completes a cycle, the particle is accelerated twice. So for each full cycle of the voltage, the particle gains energy twice.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions is the number of times the proton goes around the ring, and each time it gets a certain energy gain.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about the equations involved.

In a synchrocyclotron, the energy gained per revolution depends on the accelerating voltage and the number of times it's accelerated per revolution. Wait, I think in each revolution, the particle passes through the accelerating gap twice, so each revolution gives it two times the accelerating voltage (but with different phases). So each full revolution would give a total energy gain of about 2 * U0, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think. The voltage is applied as U(t) = U0 cos[2πν α t + Φ0]. Since the phase Φ0 is pi/4, the initial phase is 45 degrees.

But I'm not exactly sure how this relates to the number of revolutions. Maybe the key is to find the time taken to reach the kinetic energy, and then compute how many times the proton has revolved in that time.

But to compute the time, I think I need to know how the energy increases over time. The kinetic energy T is related to the number of times the proton has been accelerated. Each time the proton completes a half-cycle of the voltage, it gains energy.

Wait, another approach: the total energy gained is approximately the product of the accelerating voltage and the number of times it's accelerated. So T = n * e * U0, where e is the charge of the proton, and n is the number of times it's been accelerated.

Wait, but since the voltage is applied as an oscillating field, the effective energy gain per revolution comes from the number of times the particle is accelerated. For each full cycle of the voltage, the particle is accelerated twice (because the voltage changes direction each half cycle). So for each revolution, maybe the particle is accelerated twice.

Wait, the initial energy is zero, and the final is 950 MeV. Each acceleration step gives an energy e * U0. But wait, the voltage is applied as a cosine, so the effective energy gain per cycle is e * U0 * something.

Wait, if the voltage is sinusoidal, the maximum energy gain per half-cycle is e * U0. So each time the proton passes through the gap, it gains e * U0. But wait, in a synchrocyclotron, the phase of the voltage is synchronized with the particle's motion, so each time the particle goes through the gap, the voltage is at its peak, so each time the particle goes through, it gains e * U0.

Wait, but wait. Since the voltage is V(t) = U0 cos(...), the maximum voltage is U0. So each time the particle passes through the gap, it gains energy e * U0. So each time it goes through, it gains e U0.

But how many times does it pass through? Each revolution would involve passing through twice, I think. So for each revolution, the proton is accelerated twice, each time gaining e U0.

So the total number of accelerations is 2N, where N is the number of revolutions. So the total energy gained would be 2N e U0.

Wait, but why 2N? Because for each revolution, the particle passes the gap twice, right? So for each revolution, two accelerations.

But wait, the problem says the proton undergoes two accelerations to reach T1=950 MeV. So if T1 = e * (number of accelerations) * U0, then number of accelerations is T1/(e U0).

Wait, but 950 MeV is a lot. Let me compute that.

e is the elementary charge, 1.6e-19 coulombs. U0 is 190 kV, which is 1.9e5 volts.

So T1 is 950 MeV. Let me convert that into joules to see.

Wait, 1 eV is 1.6e-19 J, so 950 MeV is 950e6 * 1.6e-19 J = 1.52e-13 J.

But wait, the energy per acceleration is e * U0. So each acceleration gives e * U0.

So each acceleration gives 1.6e-19 C * 1.9e5 V = 3.04e-14 J.

So the number of accelerations N_acc is T1 / (e U0) = (950e6 eV) / (190e3 V * e / e) )? Wait, maybe I should compute this in terms of eV.

Wait, since U0 is 190 kV, which is 190,000 eV (since 1 eV = 1 volt * elementary charge). So each acceleration gives 190,000 eV.

Wait, but wait, the voltage is V(t) = U0 cos(...), so the maximum energy gain per half-cycle is e U0, right? So each time the proton passes through the gap (each time the voltage is at maximum), it gains e U0 energy.

So each acceleration step is when the voltage is at maximum, and the proton is accelerated by e U0.

So the total number of accelerations needed is (950e6 eV) / (190e3 eV) ) = 950e6 / 190e3 = (950 / 190) * 1e3 = 5 * 1e3 = 5000.

Wait, that can't be right. Because 950e6 divided by 190e3 is 5000. So the number of accelerations is 5000.

But each revolution gives two accelerations, as the proton passes through the gap twice per revolution (once on each side of the dees, I think). So number of revolutions N = N_acc / 2.

So N = 5000 / 2 = 2500 revolutions.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 2500. So the answer should be D.

But wait, the problem says the proton undergoes two accelerations to reach T1=950 MeV. So if 2 accelerations give 950 MeV, then the number of accelerations would be 2, but that's not the case here. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, the question states, "undergoes two accelerations in the accelerator to reach the kinetic energy T1=950MeV." Hmm, that's a bit confusing. So perhaps in the accelerator, each application of the voltage provides two accelerations. Or maybe that in each application, two accelerations happen.

Wait, but that doesn't fit with what I computed earlier. Let me think again. According to my earlier computation, the number of accelerations is 5000. Hence, the number of revolutions is 2500, which is option D.

But the problem says the proton undergoes two accelerations. So perhaps that part is just a description of the setup, but the actual calculation is based on the energy gained per acceleration.

Alternatively, maybe the voltage is applied as U(t) = U0 cos(2π ν t + Φ0), but in a synchrocyclotron, the frequency ν is adjusted as the particle's momentum changes. However, for the purpose of this problem, perhaps the frequency is such that the phase stays correct for each acceleration.

Wait, but maybe the number of revolutions is the same as the number of cycles of the voltage. Because the voltage is applied at a certain frequency, which must match the particle's rotation. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions is equal to the number of times the voltage has cycled, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, another approach: the frequency of the voltage must match the particle's rotation frequency. So the number of revolutions is equal to the number of cycles the voltage goes through. But how does that relate to the energy?

Hmm, another formula I remember is that the kinetic energy gained in a cyclotron is related to the number of times the particle passes through the gap, multiplied by the accelerating voltage times the number of accelerating gaps. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the key is to find the total number of times the particle is accelerated. Each time the particle is accelerated, it gains energy e U0. So the total number of accelerations N_acc is T1/(e U0) in energy terms.

But T1 is 950 MeV, which is 950e6 eV. U0 is 190e3 volts, which is 190e3 eV (since 1 V = 1 eV/e). So each acceleration gives 190e3 eV.

So N_acc = (950e6 eV) / (190e3 eV) ) = 950e6 / 190e3 = 9500 / 190 = 50.

Wait, wait a second. 950e6 divided by 190e3: 190e3 is 190,000. So 950,000,000 / 190,000 = 5000. So N_acc is 5000.

Each acceleration occurs twice per revolution, so number of revolutions N = 5000 / 2 = 2500. So the answer is D.

But wait, the problem says "undergoes two accelerations in the accelerator to reach the kinetic energy T1=950MeV." So maybe I'm getting confused because the problem says two accelerations. But that's probably just a description, not the actual number. Because 2 accelerations would give 2 * 190,000 eV = 380,000 eV, which is way less than 950 MeV. So that part must be a distraction.

So, yeah, the number of revolutions is 2500, which is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the number of revolutions the proton makes in the synchrocyclotron, we analyze the energy gain process. The proton starts with negligible kinetic energy and reaches a final kinetic energy of \( T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV} \). The accelerating voltage is given by \( U(t) = U_0 \cos[2\pi\nu(\alpha)t + \Phi_0] \), where \( U_0 = 190 \, \text{kV} \) and \( \Phi_0 = \frac{\pi}{4} \).

Each time the proton passes through the accelerating gap, it gains energy equal to the accelerating voltage \( U_0 \). Since the voltage is sinusoidal, the proton gains energy twice per revolution (once on each side of the dees). Therefore, the total number of accelerations \( N_{\text{acc}} \) is related to the total energy gained:

\[
N_{\text{acc}} = \frac{T_1}{e U_0}
\]

Here:
- \( T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV} = 950 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV} \),
- \( U_0 = 190 \, \text{kV} = 190 \times 10^3 \, \text{eV} \),
- \( e \) is the elementary charge, which cancels out in the units.

Substituting the values:

\[
N_{\text{acc}} = \frac{950 \times 10^6}{190 \times 10^3} = 5000
\]

Since the proton undergoes two accelerations per revolution, the total number of revolutions \( N \) is:

\[
N = \frac{N_{\text{acc}}}{2} = \frac{5000}{2} = 2500
\]

Thus, the proton makes **2500 revolutions** in the synchrocyclotron.
