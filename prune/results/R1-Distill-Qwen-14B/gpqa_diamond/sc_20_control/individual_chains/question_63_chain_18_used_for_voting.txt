Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, and a photon is absorbed to switch it to the next lowest energy state. I need to find the momentum of that photon. The options are A to D, giving different values.

First, I remember that in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is the ground state for both rotation and vibration. So, when a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next state, which I think would be either the next vibrational state or the next rotational state. But wait, which one has a lower energy increment? Because the question is about the lowest possible energy next state.

Wait, the problem says the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the transition would be the one that requires the least energy, right? Because the photon's energy must match the energy difference between the states.

So, I need to figure out which transition (rotational or vibrational) has a smaller energy difference. If the vibrational energy difference is smaller, then the photon would cause that transition. Otherwise, it would be a rotational transition.

Let me think about the formulas. The vibrational energy levels are quantized with spacing of ħω, where ω is the angular frequency. For a diatomic molecule, the vibrational energy is given by E_vib = (v + 1/2) ħω, where v is the vibrational quantum number.

So the energy difference between the ground state (v=0) and the first excited state (v=1) is ΔE_vib = ħω(1) = ħω.

For the rotational energy levels, the formula is E_rot = B J (J + 1), where B is the rotational constant and J is the rotational quantum number. The rotational constant B is given by ħ²/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia.

I is the moment of inertia, which is μ r², where μ is the reduced mass and r is the bond length. The reduced mass μ is (mX * mY)/(mX + mY). Oh wait, the given masses are in amu. I think I can convert them to kg.

So, first, let me calculate μ. The masses are Mx = 20 amu and My = 2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, 1 amu is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg. So μ = 20/11 * 1.6605e-27 kg.

Let me compute that: 20/11 is about 1.818. Multiply by 1.6605e-27. Hmm, 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ approximately 3.016e-27 kg.

Wait, let me calculate that more accurately.

20 amu is 20 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-26 kg.
2 amu is 2 * 1.6605e-27 = 3.321e-27 kg.
So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) * 1.6605e-27 = 40/22 * 1.6605e-27 kg.

40/22 is 20/11 ≈ 1.81818.

So μ = 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ let's compute 1.81818 * 1.6605.

1.81818 * 1.66 is about 3.016 (since 1.8 * 1.66 is around 2.988, plus 0.01818*1.66≈0.0299, total around 3.018).

So μ ≈3.018e-27 kg.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 is approximately 1.818 * 1.6605 = around 3.016, so 3.016e-27 kg.

Next, the moment of inertia I = μ r². The bond length r is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so r = 2e-10 m.

So I = 3.016e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

Calculate (2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m².

So I = 3.016e-27 kg *4e-20 = 1.2064e-46 kg·m².

Wait, no, 3.016e-27 *4e-20 is (3.016 *4) = 12.064, and exponents e-27 * e-20 = e-47. So I = 1.2064e-46 kg·m²?

Wait, no, 3.016e-27 * 4e-20 = 3.016 *4 =12.064; 10^(-27) * 10^(-20) = 10^(-47). So I = 12.064e-47 kg m² → 1.2064e-46 kg m².

Wait, 12.064e-47 is equal to 1.2064e-46, right. Yeah.

Then, the rotational constant B is ħ²/(2I). Planck's constant ħ is h/(2π) = approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So, B = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.2064e-46).

Compute numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ (1.05457)^2 = about 1.112, so 1.112e-68 (since 34*2=68).

Denominator: 2 * 1.2064e-46 = 2.4128e-46.

So B = (1.112e-68) / (2.4128e-46) ≈ 4.608e-23 J.

Wait, let me calculate this more accurately.

Wait, 1.0545718e-34 squared is (1.0545718)^2 = approximately 1.112, so 1.112e-68.

Divide by 2 * I, which is 2*1.2064e-46 = 2.4128e-46.

So 1.112e-68 / 2.4128e-46 = (1.112 / 2.4128) * 1e-22.

1.112 / 2.4128 ≈ 0.4608. So 0.4608e-22 = 4.608e-23 J.

So B≈4.608e-23 J.

The energy levels for rotation are E_rot = B J (J + 1). The ground state is J=0, so E_rot=0. The first excited rotational state is J=1, so E_rot = B * 2.

Wait, because J=1 gives E_rot = B * 1 * (1+1) = 2B.

So the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is 2B.

Now, the vibrational energy between v=0 and v=1 is ΔE_vib = ħω.

So we need to compare ΔE_vib and ΔE_rot.

Which is smaller? The vibrational energy spacing is ħω, which is h-bar multiplied by 4e14 rad/s.

Compute ΔE_vib = ħ * ω = (1.05457e-34 J·s) * (4e14 rad/s) ≈ 4.218e-20 J.

Wait, 1.05457e-34 *4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

What about the rotational energy difference, which is 2B. B is 4.608e-23 J, so 2B is 9.216e-23 J.

Comparing the two, ΔE_vib is ~4.218e-20 J, and ΔE_rot is ~9.216e-23 J.

Wait, no, wait: 4.218e-20 is larger than 9.216e-23. Because 4.218e-20 is about 4218e-23, which is much larger than 9.216e-23.

Wait, no: 4.218e-20 is 4.218 * 1e-20, which is the same as 421.8 * 1e-22. Whereas 9.216e-23 is 9.216 *1e-23.

So 4.218e-20 is larger than 9.216e-23.

Wait, no, wait. Because 1e-20 is 100 times larger than 1e-22. So 4.218e-20 is much larger than 9.216e-23.

Wait, no, 4.218e-20 is 4.218e-20 J, and 9.216e-23 is 0.09216e-21 J, which is much smaller.

Wait, no, wait, 4.218e-20 is 421.8e-22, and 9.216e-23 is 9.216e-23. So 421.8e-22 is 4218e-23. So 4.218e-20 = 4218e-23 J. So ΔE_vib is much larger than ΔE_rot.

So the rotational transition requires less energy than the vibrational one. So the molecule would transition via a rotational change, right? Because the photon needs to have the least possible energy to reach the next state with the lowest energy.

Wait, the question says: "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the next state would be the one with the minimal energy increase. So the smallest energy difference would be the rotational transition (since 9.2e-23 is smaller than 4.2e-20).

So the photon's energy should match the rotational energy difference of 2B.

But wait, wait. I'm a bit confused here. Because the question is about the momentum of the photon. So the photon's energy is E_photon = hc/λ = p c, since for a photon, E = pc, because m=0. So p = E/c.

So first, find the energy of the photon, then get the momentum from that.

But wait, first, which transition is the one with the lower energy. So if the rotational transition requires 9.2e-23 J, and the vibrational requires 4.2e-20 J, then the rotational transition is the lower energy. So the photon's energy should match 9.2e-23 J.

Wait, but wait, the molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is v=0 and J=0. So the next possible state with the lowest energy could be either v=1 or J=1.

But since the energy required for J=1 is lower, the photon would cause a transition to J=1, v=0. Because that's a lower energy increase than the vibrational transition.

So the photon's energy should be equal to 2B, which is 9.216e-23 J.

Wait, but wait another thing. The rotational energy levels are quantized, and the selection rules for diatomic molecules usually allow ΔJ = ±1. So from J=0, you can go to J=1.

So the photon's energy is 2B, which is the energy difference between J=0 and J=1.

So, E_photon = 2B = 9.216e-23 J.

Now, to find the momentum p of the photon. Since E = pc, p = E / c.

c is speed of light, approximately 3e8 m/s.

So p = 9.216e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = 3.072e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, that can't be. Because the options are on the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28 N·s. Wait, N·s is kg·m/s, so the units match.

Wait, 3.072e-31 kg·m/s is 3.072e-31 N·s. But none of the options are that small. The options are A:1.9e-28, B:2.3e-27, C:1.1e-27, D:1.4e-28.

Hmm, so I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let's go back.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated something earlier. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps the energy isn't 2B. Let me think again. The rotational energy for J is E_rot = B J (J+1). So the ground state is J=0, E_rot=0. The next state is J=1, which has E_rot = B * 2. So the energy difference is 2B.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating B. Let me re-calculate B.

I = μ r². μ is the reduced mass, so let's recompute that.

Mx = 20 amu, My=2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈1.81818 amu.

1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg.

1.81818 * 1.6605 ≈ 3.016. So μ ≈3.016e-27 kg.

r = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters. So r² =4e-20 m².

I = μ r² = 3.016e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² =1.2064e-46 kg m².

Then, B = ħ²/(2I).

ħ is approximately 1.05457e-34 J·s.

So ħ squared is (1.05457e-34)^2 = approx (1.05457)^2 ≈1.112, so 1.112e-68 J² s².

So B = (1.112e-68) / (2 * 1.2064e-46) = 1.112e-68 / 2.4128e-46.

Calculating that: 1.112 / 2.4128 ≈ 0.4608.

So 0.4608e-68 +46 → e-22? Wait, exponents: 1e-68 / 1e-46 =1e-22.

So B = 0.4608e-22 J → 4.608e-23 J.

So 2B is 9.216e-23 J, as I had before.

So photon energy E_photon = 2B =9.216e-23 J.

Then p = E/c. c is 3e8 m/s.

So p = 9.216e-23 J /3e8 m/s = 3.072e-31 kg m/s = 3.072e-31 N·s.

But none of the options are close to this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe the question is considering the vibrational transition. Because maybe the rotational transition isn't allowed, or perhaps I miscalculated which transition is lower.

Wait, let me compute the vibrational energy difference again. Vibrational energy is E_vib = (v + 1/2) ħ ω. So ΔE_vib = ħ ω (1) = (1.05457e-34 J·s)(4e14 rad/s) )= 4.218e-20 J.

Which is much larger than the rotational transition. So the photon's energy would be for the rotational transition.

But the options don't have a value in 1e-31. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in the energy difference?

Wait, maybe the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest vibrational and rotational state. So the next state would be either vibrational v=1 or rotational J=1. So the question is which transition is lower in energy.

Since the rotational transition requires less energy, that's the one that occurs. So the photon's energy is 2B.

But the options are higher by several orders of magnitude. So perhaps I'm using the wrong model. The question says it's modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which treats it as a non-rigid rotor.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the energy levels as a combination of rotation and vibration. But the fundamental state is the lowest energy, which is v=0, J=0.

The next possible state could be either v=1 (vibrational) or J=1 (rotational). But which energy difference is smaller?

As I calculated, the rotational transition is much lower (9e-23 J vs 4e-20 J). So the photon's energy is 9.216e-23 J.

But the options don't have this. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: maybe the model is such that the next state is a combination of both, but that's probably not the case. The fundamental state is the lowest, and the next state is the one requiring the least energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the Raman transition, where the rotational state changes without a vibrational transition. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the vibrational energy, but that's higher, so why would that be the case?

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the vibrational transition, not the rotational. Let me see the options again.

Wait, let me compute the photon momentum for the vibrational transition. E_photon = ħ ω = 4.218e-20 J.

p = E/c = 4.218e-20 /3e8 = 1.406e-28 N·s.

Which is option D: 1.4e-28 N·s.

But wait, earlier I thought that the rotational transition requires less energy. So why would the photon cause a vibrational transition then?

But wait, wait, maybe I miscalculated. Let me double-check the rotational energy.

Wait, 2B is 9.216e-23 J. So photon momentum p = 9.216e-23 /3e8 = 3.072e-31 N·s. But none of the options are anywhere near that.

But option D is 1.4e-28, which is about 4.5 times larger than 3e-31.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me double-check.

I have I = μ r².

μ = (20 * 2)/(20 +2) = 40/22 = 20/11 amu ≈ 1.818 amu.

In kg, 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg = approximately 3.016e-27 kg.

r = 2e-10 m. So r²=4e-20 m².

I = 3.016e-27 kg *4e-20 m² =1.2064e-46 kg·m².

B = ħ²/(2I). ħ is 1.05457e-34 J·s.

So ħ² is (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈1.112e-68 J²·s².

So B = (1.112e-68) / (2 * 1.2064e-46) = (1.112e-68) / (2.4128e-46) = approximately 4.608e-23 J.

Wait, but 2B is 9.216e-23 J.

That's correct.

So photon's energy is 9.216e-23 J, which gives p=3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps the question is referring to the vibrational transition. Let's compute that.

Vibrational energy: ΔE_vib = ħ ω =1.05457e-34 *4e14 =4.218e-20 J.

p = E/c =4.218e-20 /3e8 = 1.406e-28 N·s.

Which is option D: 1.4e-28 N·s.

But earlier calculation says that the rotational transition requires less energy. So why is the answer D? Unless the question is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is in the fundamental vibrational state (v=0) but can have rotational transitions. So the next state is J=1, which requires 2B energy. But the options don't have this.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the photon that causes the molecule to transition to the next higher energy state, which could be a combination of vibrational and rotational. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition where both rotational and vibrational levels change, but that seems unlikely for the minimal energy transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a bit different. The model is a non-rigid rotor, which implies that the bond length can change, but I'm not sure how that affects the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the vibrational energy is being considered as the fundamental state, and the rotational is an excited state. But the energy difference would still be higher.

Wait, maybe the question is about the Raman transition, where the rotational state changes without a vibrational transition. But I'm not sure how that would affect the energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the next state, which is (v=1, J=0), which would require vibrational energy.

But that would mean the energy is higher than the rotational transition, which is lower.

But since the rotational transition is lower, that should be the next state.

But the options don't have that. So maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the vibrational photon momentum, which is option D.

But why would the question say "next state with the lowest possible energy." So the minimal energy transition is the rotational.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is considering the energy as the sum of rotational and vibrational changes, but that's unlikely.

Alternative approach: Find the energy differences for both transitions and see which one's momentum matches an option.

Rotational: 9.216e-23 J → p = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s → 3.07e-31 N·s.

Vibrational:4.218e-20 J → p= 1.406e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options:

A)1.9e-28

B)2.3e-27

C)1.1e-27

D)1.4e-28.

So option D is 1.4e-28, which matches the vibrational transition.

So perhaps the question is expecting the vibrational transition, but I thought the rotational one was lower.

But why would that be? Let me check the numbers again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating B. Let me recalculate B.

B = ħ²/(2I).

I = μ r².

μ = (20 *2)/(20+2) amu =40/22 =20/11 ≈1.81818 amu. So μ=1.81818 *1.6605e-27 kg.

1.81818 *1.6605e-27 ≈3.016e-27 kg.

r=2e-10 m. r²=4e-20 m².

I=3.016e-27 kg *4e-20 m²=1.2064e-46 kg·m².

ħ =1.05457e-34 J·s. So ħ² =1.112e-68 J²·s².

B= (1.112e-68) / (2 *1.2064e-46) ) = (1.112e-68)/(2.4128e-46) )= approx 4.608e-23 J.

So 2B=9.216e-23 J.

So, the rotational transition is indeed lower in energy than the vibrational.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the fundamental vibrational state, and the next state is a higher vibrational state, ignoring rotation. But that would be the higher energy transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the model is such that the next state is a combination of both, but I don't think that applies here.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state to the first excited vibrational state, which requires the photon with energy ħω, which would have a momentum of (ħω)/(c).

Wait, let me compute that.

E_photon_vib = ħω =1.05457e-34 *4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

p = E_photon_vib / c =4.218e-20 /3e8 =1.406e-28 kg·m/s =1.406e-28 N·s.

Which is option D.

So perhaps the correct answer is D.

But why is the rotational transition available but the photon's momentum isn't one of the options? Because the rotational transition's p is much smaller.

Hmm, perhaps the question is asking for the transition that requires the photon to have the highest possible momentum, but that doesn't make sense with the question's wording.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the rotational transition is allowed. Maybe in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the selection rules don't allow for pure rotational transitions, so the next transition is a vibrational one.

Wait, in diatomic molecules, pure rotational transitions are usually forbidden in infrared because they require a change in dipole moment, which for diatomic molecules requires a permanent dipole. Wait, but for homonuclear diatomic molecules, like O2 or N2, pure rotational transitions are forbidden. But the problem doesn't specify that. Here, X and Y are different (20 amu and 2 amu), so the molecule is heteronuclear. So pure rotational transitions are allowed, as they have a permanent dipole moment.

So the rotational transition should be allowed.

But the options don't have the corresponding p. So perhaps the question is referring to the vibrational transition, and the options are wrong, or perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the energy of the photon to be the sum of both rotational and vibrational transitions, but that would be higher than either.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the rotational levels are quantized with E_rot = (J (J+1) ) * B, but the selection rule allows only ΔJ = ±1. So from J=0, it can go to J=1, which requires 2B.

So the energy is 2B.

But p would be 3e-31, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the vibrational transition, giving p=1.4e-28, which is option D.

So perhaps the correct answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition the diatomic molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy differences between rotational and vibrational transitions.

### Key Information:
1. **Masses of atoms**:  
   - \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu} \), \( M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \).  
   - Reduced mass:  
     \[
     \mu = \frac{M_x \cdot M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} = \frac{40}{22} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}.
     \]  
   - Converting to kilograms:  
     \[
     \mu \approx 1.818 \cdot 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.016 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
     \]

2. **Bond length**:  
   - \( r = 2 \, \text{angstroms} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \).  
   - Moment of inertia:  
     \[
     I = \mu r^2 = 3.016 \times 10^{-27} \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.2064 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2.
     \]

3. **Rotational constant**:  
   - \( B = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I} \), where \( \hbar = 1.05457 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \).  
   - Substituting values:  
     \[
     B = \frac{(1.05457 \times 10^{-34})^2}{2 \cdot 1.2064 \times 10^{-46}} \approx \frac{1.112 \times 10^{-68}}{2.4128 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 4.608 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
     \]  
   - Energy difference for rotational transition (\( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} \)):  
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B = 2 \cdot 4.608 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \approx 9.216 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
     \]

4. **Vibrational energy difference**:  
   - \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = \hbar \omega \), where \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \).  
   - Substituting values:  
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = (1.05457 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) \approx 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}.
     \]

### Comparison of Energy Differences:
- \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} \approx 9.216 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) (rotational transition).  
- \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} \approx 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J} \) (vibrational transition).  

The rotational transition requires significantly less energy than the vibrational transition. However, the options provided do not include the momentum corresponding to the rotational transition (\( p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} \approx 3.072 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N·s} \)).

### Photon Momentum for Vibrational Transition:
If the question instead refers to the vibrational transition, the momentum of the photon is:  
\[
p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{4.218 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.406 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}.
\]  
This matches **Option D**.

### Conclusion:
While the rotational transition requires less energy, the provided options suggest the question is asking for the vibrational transition. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, and a photon is absorbed to switch it to the next lowest energy state. I need to find the momentum of that photon. The options are A to D, giving different values.

First, I remember that in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is the ground state for both rotation and vibration. So, when a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next state, which I think would be either the next vibrational state or the next rotational state. But wait, which one has a lower energy increment? Because the question is about the lowest possible energy next state.

Wait, the problem says the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the transition would be the one that requires the least energy, right? Because the photon's energy must match the energy difference between the states.

So, I need to figure out which transition (rotational or vibrational) has a smaller energy difference. If the vibrational energy difference is smaller, then the photon would cause that transition. Otherwise, it would be a rotational transition.

Let me think about the formulas. The vibrational energy levels are quantized with spacing of ħω, where ω is the angular frequency. For a diatomic molecule, the vibrational energy is given by E_vib = (v + 1/2) ħω, where v is the vibrational quantum number.

So the energy difference between the ground state (v=0) and the first excited state (v=1) is ΔE_vib = ħω(1) = ħω.

For the rotational energy levels, the formula is E_rot = B J (J + 1), where B is the rotational constant and J is the rotational quantum number. The rotational constant B is given by ħ²/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia.

I is the moment of inertia, which is μ r², where μ is the reduced mass and r is the bond length. The reduced mass μ is (mX * mY)/(mX + mY). Oh wait, the given masses are in amu. I think I can convert them to kg.

So, first, let me calculate μ. The masses are Mx = 20 amu and My = 2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, 1 amu is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg. So μ = 20/11 * 1.6605e-27 kg.

Let me compute that: 20/11 is about 1.818. Multiply by 1.6605e-27. Hmm, 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ approximately 3.016e-27 kg.

Wait, let me calculate that more accurately.

20 amu is 20 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-26 kg.
2 amu is 2 * 1.6605e-27 = 3.321e-27 kg.
So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) * 1.6605e-27 = 40/22 * 1.6605e-27 kg.

40/22 is 20/11 ≈ 1.81818.

So μ = 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ let's compute 1.81818 * 1.6605.

1.81818 * 1.66 is about 3.016 (since 1.8 * 1.66 is around 2.988, plus 0.01818*1.66≈0.0299, total around 3.018).

So μ ≈3.018e-27 kg.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 is approximately 1.818 * 1.6605 = around 3.016, so 3.016e-27 kg.

Next, the moment of inertia I = μ r². The bond length r is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so r = 2e-10 m.

So I = 3.016e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

Calculate (2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m².

So I = 3.016e-27 kg *4e-20 = 1.2064e-46 kg·m².

Wait, no, 3.016e-27 *4e-20 is (3.016 *4) = 12.064, and exponents e-27 * e-20 = e-47. So I = 1.2064e-46 kg·m²?

Wait, no, 3.016e-27 * 4e-20 = 3.016 *4 =12.064; 10^(-27) * 10^(-20) = 10^(-47). So I = 12.064e-47 kg m² → 1.2064e-46 kg m².

Wait, 12.064e-47 is equal to 1.2064e-46, right. Yeah.

Then, the rotational constant B is ħ²/(2I). Planck's constant ħ is h/(2π) = approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So, B = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.2064e-46).

Compute numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ (1.05457)^2 = about 1.112, so 1.112e-68 (since 34*2=68).

Denominator: 2 * 1.2064e-46 = 2.4128e-46.

So B = (1.112e-68) / (2.4128e-46) ≈ 4.608e-23 J.

Wait, let me calculate this more accurately.

Wait, 1.0545718e-34 squared is (1.0545718)^2 = approximately 1.112, so 1.112e-68.

Divide by 2 * I, which is 2*1.2064e-46 = 2.4128e-46.

So 1.112e-68 / 2.4128e-46 = (1.112 / 2.4128) * 1e-22.

1.112 / 2.4128 ≈ 0.4608. So 0.4608e-22 = 4.608e-23 J.

So B≈4.608e-23 J.

The energy levels for rotation are E_rot = B J (J + 1). The ground state is J=0, so E_rot=0. The first excited rotational state is J=1, so E_rot = B * 2.

Wait, because J=1 gives E_rot = B * 1 * (1+1) = 2B.

So the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is 2B.

Now, the vibrational energy between v=0 and v=1 is ΔE_vib = ħω.

So we need to compare ΔE_vib and ΔE_rot.

Which is smaller? The vibrational energy spacing is ħω, which is h-bar multiplied by 4e14 rad/s.

Compute ΔE_vib = ħ * ω = (1.05457e-34 J·s) * (4e14 rad/s) ≈ 4.218e-20 J.

Wait, 1.05457e-34 *4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

What about the rotational energy difference, which is 2B. B is 4.608e-23 J, so 2B is 9.216e-23 J.

Comparing the two, ΔE_vib is ~4.218e-20 J, and ΔE_rot is ~9.216e-23 J.

Wait, no, wait: 4.218e-20 is larger than 9.216e-23. Because 4.218e-20 is about 4218e-23, which is much larger than 9.216e-23.

Wait, no: 4.218e-20 is 4.218 * 1e-20, which is the same as 421.8 * 1e-22. Whereas 9.216e-23 is 9.216 *1e-23.

So 4.218e-20 is larger than 9.216e-23.

Wait, no, wait. Because 1e-20 is 100 times larger than 1e-22. So 4.218e-20 is much larger than 9.216e-23.

Wait, no, 4.218e-20 is 4.218e-20 J, and 9.216e-23 is 0.09216e-21 J, which is much smaller.

Wait, no, wait, 4.218e-20 is 421.8e-22, and 9.216e-23 is 9.216e-23. So 421.8e-22 is 4218e-23. So 4.218e-20 = 4218e-23 J. So ΔE_vib is much larger than ΔE_rot.

So the rotational transition requires less energy than the vibrational one. So the molecule would transition via a rotational change, right? Because the photon needs to have the least possible energy to reach the next state with the lowest energy.

Wait, the question says: "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the next state would be the one with the minimal energy increase. So the smallest energy difference would be the rotational transition (since 9.2e-23 is smaller than 4.2e-20).

So the photon's energy should match the rotational energy difference of 2B.

But wait, wait. I'm a bit confused here. Because the question is about the momentum of the photon. So the photon's energy is E_photon = hc/λ = p c, since for a photon, E = pc, because m=0. So p = E/c.

So first, find the energy of the photon, then get the momentum from that.

But wait, first, which transition is the one with the lower energy. So if the rotational transition requires 9.2e-23 J, and the vibrational requires 4.2e-20 J, then the rotational transition is the lower energy. So the photon's energy should match 9.2e-23 J.

Wait, but wait, the molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is v=0 and J=0. So the next possible state with the lowest energy could be either v=1 or J=1.

But since the energy required for J=1 is lower, the photon would cause a transition to J=1, v=0. Because that's a lower energy increase than the vibrational transition.

So the photon's energy should be equal to 2B, which is 9.216e-23 J.

Wait, but wait another thing. The rotational energy levels are quantized, and the selection rules for diatomic molecules usually allow ΔJ = ±1. So from J=0, you can go to J=1.

So the photon's energy is 2B, which is the energy difference between J=0 and J=1.

So, E_photon = 2B = 9.216e-23 J.

Now, to find the momentum p of the photon. Since E = pc, p = E / c.

c is speed of light, approximately 3e8 m/s.

So p = 9.216e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = 3.072e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, that can't be. Because the options are on the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28 N·s. Wait, N·s is kg·m/s, so the units match.

Wait, 3.072e-31 kg·m/s is 3.072e-31 N·s. But none of the options are that small. The options are A:1.9e-28, B:2.3e-27, C:1.1e-27, D:1.4e-28.

Hmm, so I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let's go back.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated something earlier. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps the energy isn't 2B. Let me think again. The rotational energy for J is E_rot = B J (J+1). So the ground state is J=0, E_rot=0. The next state is J=1, which has E_rot = B * 2. So the energy difference is 2B.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating B. Let me re-calculate B.

I = μ r². μ is the reduced mass, so let's recompute that.

Mx = 20 amu, My=2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈1.81818 amu.

1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg.

1.81818 * 1.6605 ≈ 3.016. So μ ≈3.016e-27 kg.

r = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters. So r² =4e-20 m².

I = μ r² = 3.016e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² =1.2064e-46 kg m².

Then, B = ħ²/(2I).

ħ is approximately 1.05457e-34 J·s.

So ħ squared is (1.05457e-34)^2 = approx (1.05457)^2 ≈1.112, so 1.112e-68 J² s².

So B = (1.112e-68) / (2 * 1.2064e-46) = 1.112e-68 / 2.4128e-46.

Calculating that: 1.112 / 2.4128 ≈ 0.4608.

So 0.4608e-68 +46 → e-22? Wait, exponents: 1e-68 / 1e-46 =1e-22.

So B = 0.4608e-22 J → 4.608e-23 J.

So 2B is 9.216e-23 J, as I had before.

So photon energy E_photon = 2B =9.216e-23 J.

Then p = E/c. c is 3e8 m/s.

So p = 9.216e-23 J /3e8 m/s = 3.072e-31 kg m/s = 3.072e-31 N·s.

But none of the options are close to this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe the question is considering the vibrational transition. Because maybe the rotational transition isn't allowed, or perhaps I miscalculated which transition is lower.

Wait, let me compute the vibrational energy difference again. Vibrational energy is E_vib = (v + 1/2) ħ ω. So ΔE_vib = ħ ω (1) = (1.05457e-34 J·s)(4e14 rad/s) )= 4.218e-20 J.

Which is much larger than the rotational transition. So the photon's energy would be for the rotational transition.

But the options don't have a value in 1e-31. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in the energy difference?

Wait, maybe the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest vibrational and rotational state. So the next state would be either vibrational v=1 or rotational J=1. So the question is which transition is lower in energy.

Since the rotational transition requires less energy, that's the one that occurs. So the photon's energy is 2B.

But the options are higher by several orders of magnitude. So perhaps I'm using the wrong model. The question says it's modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which treats it as a non-rigid rotor.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the energy levels as a combination of rotation and vibration. But the fundamental state is the lowest energy, which is v=0, J=0.

The next possible state could be either v=1 (vibrational) or J=1 (rotational). But which energy difference is smaller?

As I calculated, the rotational transition is much lower (9e-23 J vs 4e-20 J). So the photon's energy is 9.216e-23 J.

But the options don't have this. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: maybe the model is such that the next state is a combination of both, but that's probably not the case. The fundamental state is the lowest, and the next state is the one requiring the least energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the Raman transition, where the rotational state changes without a vibrational transition. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the vibrational energy, but that's higher, so why would that be the case?

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the vibrational transition, not the rotational. Let me see the options again.

Wait, let me compute the photon momentum for the vibrational transition. E_photon = ħ ω = 4.218e-20 J.

p = E/c = 4.218e-20 /3e8 = 1.406e-28 N·s.

Which is option D: 1.4e-28 N·s.

But wait, earlier I thought that the rotational transition requires less energy. So why would the photon cause a vibrational transition then?

But wait, wait, maybe I miscalculated. Let me double-check the rotational energy.

Wait, 2B is 9.216e-23 J. So photon momentum p = 9.216e-23 /3e8 = 3.072e-31 N·s. But none of the options are anywhere near that.

But option D is 1.4e-28, which is about 4.5 times larger than 3e-31.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me double-check.

I have I = μ r².

μ = (20 * 2)/(20 +2) = 40/22 = 20/11 amu ≈ 1.818 amu.

In kg, 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg = approximately 3.016e-27 kg.

r = 2e-10 m. So r²=4e-20 m².

I = 3.016e-27 kg *4e-20 m² =1.2064e-46 kg·m².

B = ħ²/(2I). ħ is 1.05457e-34 J·s.

So ħ² is (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈1.112e-68 J²·s².

So B = (1.112e-68) / (2 * 1.2064e-46) = (1.112e-68) / (2.4128e-46) = approximately 4.608e-23 J.

Wait, but 2B is 9.216e-23 J.

That's correct.

So photon's energy is 9.216e-23 J, which gives p=3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps the question is referring to the vibrational transition. Let's compute that.

Vibrational energy: ΔE_vib = ħ ω =1.05457e-34 *4e14 =4.218e-20 J.

p = E/c =4.218e-20 /3e8 = 1.406e-28 N·s.

Which is option D: 1.4e-28 N·s.

But earlier calculation says that the rotational transition requires less energy. So why is the answer D? Unless the question is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is in the fundamental vibrational state (v=0) but can have rotational transitions. So the next state is J=1, which requires 2B energy. But the options don't have this.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the photon that causes the molecule to transition to the next higher energy state, which could be a combination of vibrational and rotational. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition where both rotational and vibrational levels change, but that seems unlikely for the minimal energy transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a bit different. The model is a non-rigid rotor, which implies that the bond length can change, but I'm not sure how that affects the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the vibrational energy is being considered as the fundamental state, and the rotational is an excited state. But the energy difference would still be higher.

Wait, maybe the question is about the Raman transition, where the rotational state changes without a vibrational transition. But I'm not sure how that would affect the energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the next state, which is (v=1, J=0), which would require vibrational energy.

But that would mean the energy is higher than the rotational transition, which is lower.

But since the rotational transition is lower, that should be the next state.

But the options don't have that. So maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the vibrational photon momentum, which is option D.

But why would the question say "next state with the lowest possible energy." So the minimal energy transition is the rotational.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is considering the energy as the sum of rotational and vibrational changes, but that's unlikely.

Alternative approach: Find the energy differences for both transitions and see which one's momentum matches an option.

Rotational: 9.216e-23 J → p = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s → 3.07e-31 N·s.

Vibrational:4.218e-20 J → p= 1.406e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options:

A)1.9e-28

B)2.3e-27

C)1.1e-27

D)1.4e-28.

So option D is 1.4e-28, which matches the vibrational transition.

So perhaps the question is expecting the vibrational transition, but I thought the rotational one was lower.

But why would that be? Let me check the numbers again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating B. Let me recalculate B.

B = ħ²/(2I).

I = μ r².

μ = (20 *2)/(20+2) amu =40/22 =20/11 ≈1.81818 amu. So μ=1.81818 *1.6605e-27 kg.

1.81818 *1.6605e-27 ≈3.016e-27 kg.

r=2e-10 m. r²=4e-20 m².

I=3.016e-27 kg *4e-20 m²=1.2064e-46 kg·m².

ħ =1.05457e-34 J·s. So ħ² =1.112e-68 J²·s².

B= (1.112e-68) / (2 *1.2064e-46) ) = (1.112e-68)/(2.4128e-46) )= approx 4.608e-23 J.

So 2B=9.216e-23 J.

So, the rotational transition is indeed lower in energy than the vibrational.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the fundamental vibrational state, and the next state is a higher vibrational state, ignoring rotation. But that would be the higher energy transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the model is such that the next state is a combination of both, but I don't think that applies here.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state to the first excited vibrational state, which requires the photon with energy ħω, which would have a momentum of (ħω)/(c).

Wait, let me compute that.

E_photon_vib = ħω =1.05457e-34 *4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

p = E_photon_vib / c =4.218e-20 /3e8 =1.406e-28 kg·m/s =1.406e-28 N·s.

Which is option D.

So perhaps the correct answer is D.

But why is the rotational transition available but the photon's momentum isn't one of the options? Because the rotational transition's p is much smaller.

Hmm, perhaps the question is asking for the transition that requires the photon to have the highest possible momentum, but that doesn't make sense with the question's wording.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the rotational transition is allowed. Maybe in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the selection rules don't allow for pure rotational transitions, so the next transition is a vibrational one.

Wait, in diatomic molecules, pure rotational transitions are usually forbidden in infrared because they require a change in dipole moment, which for diatomic molecules requires a permanent dipole. Wait, but for homonuclear diatomic molecules, like O2 or N2, pure rotational transitions are forbidden. But the problem doesn't specify that. Here, X and Y are different (20 amu and 2 amu), so the molecule is heteronuclear. So pure rotational transitions are allowed, as they have a permanent dipole moment.

So the rotational transition should be allowed.

But the options don't have the corresponding p. So perhaps the question is referring to the vibrational transition, and the options are wrong, or perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the energy of the photon to be the sum of both rotational and vibrational transitions, but that would be higher than either.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the rotational levels are quantized with E_rot = (J (J+1) ) * B, but the selection rule allows only ΔJ = ±1. So from J=0, it can go to J=1, which requires 2B.

So the energy is 2B.

But p would be 3e-31, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the vibrational transition, giving p=1.4e-28, which is option D.

So perhaps the correct answer is D.


To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition the diatomic molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy differences between rotational and vibrational transitions.

   - \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = \hbar \omega \), where \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \).  
   - Substituting values:  
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = (1.05457 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) \approx 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}.
     \]

### Comparison of Energy Differences:
- \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} \approx 9.216 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) (rotational transition).  
- \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} \approx 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J} \) (vibrational transition).  

The rotational transition requires significantly less energy than the vibrational transition. However, the options provided do not include the momentum corresponding to the rotational transition (\( p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} \approx 3.072 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N·s} \)).

### Photon Momentum for Vibrational Transition:
If the question instead refers to the vibrational transition, the momentum of the photon is:  
\[
p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{4.218 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.406 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}.
\]  
This matches **Option D**.

### Conclusion:
While the rotational transition requires less energy, the provided options suggest the question is asking for the vibrational transition. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
