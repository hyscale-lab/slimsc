Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this quantum mechanics problem. Let's see what it's about. The question is about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. I need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that in a 1D infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula for the energy levels is E_n = (n² π² ħ²) / (2mL²), where n is the principal quantum number. Oh wait, the question says E is given as pi² hbar squared over 2m L squared. So E is E_1, right? Because when n=1, E_1 = E. So any energy level would be E multiplied by the square of the quantum number.

But wait, the particles are identical fermions because they're spin-1/2. So they obey the Pauli exclusion principle, meaning each particle must occupy a unique quantum state. Or more precisely, each spatial state can hold a certain number of particles based on their spin.

In a 1D well, each energy level E_n can accommodate two particles because the spin can be up or down. So for each n, you can have two particles with opposite spins.

So for four particles, how are they filled? Let's think step by step.

The ground state would be the lowest energy configuration. So the particles will fill the lowest possible energy levels, each with the maximum number of particles allowed.

So for n=1: can hold 2 particles. Then n=2: another 2. So four particles in total. So in the ground state, we'll have two particles in n=1 and two in n=2. Wait, but wait—each energy level can hold two particles because spin up and down. So yes, n=1: 2 particles, n=2: 2 particles. So the total energy would be the sum of each particle's energy.

Wait, no. Each particle in n=1 contributes E_1, which is E. Each in n=2 contributes E_2, which is (2²)E =4E. So for two particles in n=1, their energy is 2E. Two in n=2: 2 * 4E=8E. So total energy for ground state is 2E +8E=10E.

Wait, but wait. No, wait a second. Wait, each particle in a particular n has energy E_n. So for four particles, in the ground state, two in n=1 and two in n=2. So the total energy is (2 * E_1) + (2 * E_2). E_1 is E, E_2 is 4E. So 2E + 8E=10E. So the ground state energy is 10E.

Wait, but wait another thing. Wait, the question is about the energies of the ground state, first excited, and second excited states. So the ground state is the lowest energy, which is 10E.

Now, what about the first excited state? The first excited state would be the next higher energy state that the system can occupy. But wait, the system's energy depends on how the particles are arranged. So when we have four particles, the ground state is filled with n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles). The next state would involve the next available energy level. So the first excited state would be when one of the particles from n=2 moves to a higher level, but keeping in mind that we have to obey the Pauli exclusion.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me think. Each energy level can hold two particles, one for each spin. So in the ground state, all the lower energy levels are filled: n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles). So what's the next possible configuration? The next available n is n=3. But since each level can only hold two, the next particle would have to go to n=3, but we already have four particles. Oh wait, no. Wait, no, the four particles are already in n=1 and n=2, each with two. So if we are considering the first excited state, perhaps one of the particles from n=2 moves up to n=3. But that might not be the case because that would increase the total energy, but maybe that's not the first excited state.

Wait, perhaps I'm thinking about it incorrectly. Let's think in terms of the possible states and how the particles are filled. The ground state has the lowest possible energy, which is when all the particles are in the lowest possible levels. So, for four fermions, with each n level holding 2, the filling is n=1 (2), n=2 (2)—so four particles.

Now, the first excited state would be when the highest occupied level is n=3. How? Because you can't have more than two particles in a single n level. So the first excited state would involve promoting one particle from n=2 to n=3. Or maybe it's when the next available level is filled.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, making the highest n=3. So the configuration would be n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). But wait, no, because each n can hold two particles. So perhaps the first excited state is when the filling is n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1), but that leaves two more particles? No, because we already have four particles. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when the configuration is n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). No, that's only four particles. So, in that case, the total energy would be (2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_3). E_1 is E, E_2 is 4E, E_3 is 9E.

So total energy is 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.

Wait, but wait. If the ground state is 10E, then the first excited state would be higher than that. So 15E would be the next possible energy.

Wait, but what about another scenario. Maybe the first excited state is when the configuration is n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). But that would require four particles. Wait, no: n=1 holds 2, n=2 holds 1, n=3 holds 1. That's four. So the total energy is 2*E + 1*(4E) + 1*(9E) = 2E +4E +9E=15E.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps the first excited state is when one of the particles in n=2 is promoted to n=3, but the other stays in n=2. So the energies would be 2E (from n=1) + (1*4E from n=2) + (1*9E from n=3) = 15E. So that's the first excited state.

Then, what about the second excited state? The second excited state would be the next higher energy. So perhaps another promotion happens, like moving another particle to a higher level. Or maybe promoting a particle from n=2 to n=4.

Wait, let's think. What's the next possible configuration after the first excited state. The next highest possible would be when two particles are in n=3 and none in n=4. But wait, each n can take two, so if I have n=1 (2), n=2 (0), n=3 (2), that's four particles. Wait, but n=2 can't be empty because you can have particles in higher n. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, another approach: The ground state is n=1 (2), n=2 (2). The first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, so the configuration is n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). The total energy would be 2E +4E +9E=15E. The second excited state would be when another particle moves up to n=3. So now, n=1 (2), n=2 (0), n=3 (2). So total energy is 2E +0 + 18E=20E. But wait, that's not matching any of the options. Hmm, the options given are:

A) 30E, 39E, 50E

B)4E,10E,50E

C)4E,10E,15E

D)10E,15E,18E

Wait, looking at option D: 10E,15E,18E. So the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E.

Wait, but when I thought about the second excited state as n=1 (2), n=2 (0), n=3 (2), that gives 2E (from n=1) + 2*9E=18E, so 2E +18E=20E. That doesn't match any of the options, so perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe the first excited state isn't moving a particle from n=2 to n=3. Maybe another configuration is possible. Let me think again. The ground state is four particles in n=1 and n=2. So what's the first possible higher energy state? Maybe the first excited state is when the particles are arranged as n=1 (2), n=2 (1), and n=3 (1), as I thought before, giving 15E. Then the second excited state would be when another particle moves up, say from n=2 to n=4. Let's see: n=1 (2), n=2 (0), n=3 (1), n=4 (1). So the energies would be 2E +0 +9E +16E=27E. But that's not an option either.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible energy levels for each state and sum them correctly. Let me list the possible states in order.

Ground state: n=1 (2), n=2 (2). Total energy: 2E + 2*4E = 10E.

First excited state: The next possible arrangement. Let me think: perhaps n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). So energies: 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Second excited state: Then, the next arrangement would be n=1 (2), n=2 (0), n=3 (2). So energies: 2E +0 + 2*9E= 20E. But none of the options have 20E. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4. So perhaps n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1), and n=4 (0), but that's only four particles. No, that's not the case. Wait, maybe another configuration where particles are in higher n.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when particles are in n=1 (2), n=3 (2). So the total energy would be 2E + 2*9E=20E. But then 20E would be the first excited state, which doesn't match any of the options either.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe I should think in terms of the total possible energy states and not the individual particles. Wait, each particle's energy contributes to the total. So for the ground state, it's the sum of the lowest possible energies for four particles.

Each energy level can hold two particles. So the four particles are filled as n=1 (2), n=2 (2). So the total energy is 2E (from n=1) + 2*4E (from n=2)=2E +8E=10E.

Then, the first excited state would have the next possible configuration, which is n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). So the total energy is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

The second excited state would be the next possible configuration. Here, perhaps n=1 (2), n=3 (2). But wait, can n=3 hold two particles? Yes. So the configuration would be n=1 (2), n=2 (0), n=3 (2). So the energy is 2E + 2*9E=2E +18E=20E. But none of the options have 20E. Hmm.

Looking at the options, option D has energies of 10E, 15E, 18E. So the third energy level is 18E. How do we reach 18E? Let's see: 18E is 9E * 2, which would be two particles in n=3 (each contributing 9E, but wait, 9E is the energy for a single particle in n=3, so two would add 18E. So the configuration would be n=1 (2), n=3 (2). So the sum is 2E + 2*9E=2E +18E=20E. That's not matching 18E.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4. Let's see: 4^2=16, so E_4=16E. So if the configuration is n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1), n=4 (0), but that's four particles. Alternatively, perhaps n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=4 (1). So their energies: 2E +4E +16E=22E. Still not matching.

Alternatively, maybe the second excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=4. Let's see: n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=4 (1). So the sum is 2E +4E +16E=22E. Not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me list the possible energy levels:

n: 1 → E= E.

n: 2 → E=4E.

n:3 → E=9E.

n:4 → E=16E.

n:5 →25E, etc.

Now, the ground state is 2 particles in n=1 and 2 in n=2: 2E + 8E =10E.

The first excited state would be when the highest possible is n=3. So perhaps, one particle from n=2 moves to n=3, making the configuration n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). So total energy is 2E +4E +9E =15E.

The second excited state would then be when another particle from n=2 moves to n=3, so the configuration is n=1 (2), n=2 (0), n=3 (2). So the energy is 2E + 0 + 18E=20E.

But again, none of the options have 20E. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, looking at the options, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=5. But that would be E=25E, which seems too high.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4, so E=16E. So configuration would be n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=4 (1). So energies: 2E +4E +16E=22E.

Hmm, not matching any option.

Wait, looking at the options, option C has 4E, 10E, 15E. But the ground state is 10E, which is the sum of 2E (n=1) and 8E (n=2). So option C's ground state is 4E, which doesn't make sense. So option C is out.

Option B: 4, 10,50. The ground state is 4E, which would be two particles in n=1 (2E) and none in n=2? No, because four particles would need to be in n=1 and n=2. So option B's ground state is 4E, which is only possible if all four particles are in n=2. But each n can hold two particles, so n=2 can have two. So that would leave two more particles, but there's no room in n=2. So that can't be. So option B is incorrect.

Option A: 30E, 39E,50E. That seems way too high.

Option D: 10E, 15E, 18E. So ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E.

Wait, how would I get 18E? Let's see. 18E could be 2E from n=1 and 16E from n=4.

Wait, 2E + 16E=18E. But that would require two particles in n=1 and two in n=4, but wait, no—because four particles would be two in n=1 and two in n=4. So the total energy would be 2E (n=1) + 2*(16E) = 2E +32E=34E. Which doesn't match any option.

Alternatively, maybe the configuration for the second excited state is two particles in n=3. So 2*(9E)=18E plus 2E from n=1. So 2E +18E=20E. Again, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=5, but that's 25E, which is not in the options.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the first excited state is when the configuration is n=1 (2), n=3 (2). So the energies would be 2E + 18E=20E. But again, that's not matching any option.

Hmm, this is confusing. Let me think again. Maybe the first excited state isn't n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). Perhaps another arrangement is possible.

Wait, perhaps the energy levels are filled as follows:

Ground state: n=1 (2), n=2 (2) → energy sum 10E.

First excited state: n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1) → 15E.

Second excited state: n=1 (2), n=2 (0), n=3 (2) → 20E.

But none of the options have 20E. The options' highest is 50E, which is way higher.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in how the particles are filled. Because in a 1D well, each particle's state is determined by n and spin. So each n can hold two particles (spin up and down). So maybe the filling is more about the individual levels.

Wait, another approach: For four spin-1/2 particles, the ground state would have the lowest possible energies, so two in n=1 and two in n=2. So the total energy is 2E + 8E =10E.

The first excited state would be moving one of the n=2 particles to n=3, so the configuration is n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). The energy is 2E +4E +9E =15E.

The second excited state would be moving another n=2 particle to n=3, making n=3 (2). So energy would be 2E + 0 + 18E=20E. But the option D says second excited is 18E. So that would be 2E + 16E=18E, which would be two particles in n=4. But that would require n=1 (2), n=4 (2). So 2E + 2*16E=34E. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state has one particle in n=4 and others in lower levels. For example, n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=4 (1). The energy would be 2E +4E +16E=22E. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of adding the next possible state. Let's list all possible states in order of increasing energy.

Ground state: 10E.

First excited: 15E.

Second excited: 18E. How?

Wait, 18E would be 2E (from n=1) + 16E (from n=4). But that's two particles: 2 in n=1 and 2 in n=4? No, that would be four particles, so 2E + 2*16E=34E. Not 18E.

Wait, 18E is 9E *2. So two particles in n=3. So 2E (n=1) + 2*9E=2E +18E=20E.

Hmm. Maybe the second excited state is when particles are in n=3 (2) and n=4 (0). So 2E (n=1) + 18E (n=3) →20E.

But this is not matching any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the energies are calculated differently. Maybe the energy for each particle is E_n = n^2 E, where E is the base energy (E_1). So for four particles, the ground state is the sum of the four lowest possible E_n's, each multiplied by the appropriate number of particles, but considering that each n can hold up to two.

So for four particles:

n=1: 2 particles → energy 2E.

n=2: 2 particles → 2*(4E)=8E.

Total ground state: 10E.

First excited: perhaps one particle promoted to n=3. So particles in n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). So energy is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Second excited: another particle promoted to n=3. Now, n=3 has two particles. So energy is 2E + 0 (n=2 has 0, because all two particles in n=2 have been promoted to n=3 and n=4? Wait, no. Let me see.

Wait, in four particles, after promoting two to n=3, that would require n=3 to hold two particles. So configuration would be n=1 (2), n=3 (2). So the sum is 2E + 2*9E=2E +18E=20E.

But the options don't have 20E. So perhaps I'm missing another way.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when the particles are arranged as n=1 (2), n=2 (0), n=3 (2). So two in n=3, which gives 2*9E=18E. So the total energy is 2E +18E=20E. But the options don't have this.

Wait, looking back at the options, option D's second excited state is 18E. That would imply that the total energy is 18E. How?

If the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E. Let's see:

10E → 2E + 8E (n=1 and n=2).

15E →2E +4E +9E.

18E → perhaps 2E +16E (n=4). But that's 2E +16E=18E. But that would require two particles in n=1 and two in n=4. So the configuration would be n=1 (2), n=4 (2). So energy is 2E + 2*(16E)=34E, which doesn't match 18E.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and the other in n=4. So the configuration would be n=1 (2), n=3 (1), n=4 (1). So energy would be 2E + 9E +16E=27E. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible total energies.

Option D: 10E (ground), 15E (first excited), 18E (second excited).

So the second excited state energy is 18E. How could that happen?

If the configuration is n=1 (2), n=2 (0), n=3 (1), n=4 (1). So the sum is 2E + 9E +16E=27E. Not 18E.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when the configuration is n=1 (2), n=3 (2). Which would give 2E + 2*9E=2E +18E=20E.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should consider that the second excited state is when the highest level is n=4, but only one particle is there. So configuration would be n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=4 (1). So sum is 2E +4E +16E=22E. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the first excited state isn't when a particle moves to n=3, but perhaps when a particle moves to n=4. Let me see: configuration n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=4 (1). So sum is 2E +4E +16E=22E. But that's higher than the first excited state.

Wait, no, because moving a particle to a higher n would result in a higher energy, so the first excited state must be lower than the second. So the configuration with one particle in n=3 (15E) is the first excited state, and then the next is when another particle moves to n=3 (20E), or one moves to n=4 (22E).

But none of these match the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the total energy as the sum of the individual energies, but considering that the particles are fermions and their wavefunctions are antisymmetric, but that doesn't change the energy. So perhaps the correct approach is to fill the lowest possible levels.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the first excited state isn't when a particle moves to n=3, but when a particle moves to a higher energy level, but perhaps spin states are considered differently. No, spin states are accounted for by the two particles per n level.

Wait, perhaps the ground state is when all four particles are in the same n level. But that's impossible because each n can hold only two. So the ground state must have two in n=1 and two in n=2.

So I'm back to the initial conclusion: ground state is 10E. First excited state is 15E. Second excited state is 20E. But the options don't have 20E.

But looking at the options, option D has 10E,15E,18E. So perhaps the second excited state is when the configuration is n=1 (2), n=3 (2), but that would be 2E + 18E=20E, which isn't 18E. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when three particles are in n=2 and one in n=3. But that can't happen because each n can hold two particles. So three in n=2 is impossible.

Wait, maybe the first excited state is 15E, and the second excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=4, but another is promoted to n=3. So the configuration is n=1 (2), n=3 (1), n=4 (1). So the sum is 2E +9E +16E=27E. But that's not in the options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something in the way the energy levels are calculated. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the sum of the individual energies without considering the maximum number of particles per level. But that can't be, because the particles are fermions and must obey the Pauli exclusion.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the particles as spin-1/2 but not accounting for the Pauli principle. But the question states they are spin-1/2, so they must obey it.

Wait, another approach: Let's list the possible energy levels for each possible state.

The ground state has the lowest possible total energy, which is when the four particles are in the lowest possible levels. So two in n=1 and two in n=2: 2E +8E=10E.

The first excited state would be the next possible arrangement. So perhaps one particle from n=2 moves to n=3, giving n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). So energy is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

The second excited state would then be when another particle is promoted. So either another moves to n=3, making n=3 (2), so energy 2E + 18E=20E. Or one moves to n=4, making the configuration n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=4 (1), which sums to 2E +4E +16E=22E.

But the options don't have 20E or 22E.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when the configuration is n=1 (2), n=2 (0), n=3 (2). So sum is 2E + 18E=20E.

But option D's second excited is 18E, which doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the total energy as the sum of the squares of the quantum numbers, but scaled differently. Let me calculate the energies for each possible configuration again.

n=1: E=1²E=1E.

n=2: 4E.

n=3:9E.

n=4:16E.

So for four particles:

Ground state: 2*(1E) + 2*(4E) =2E +8E=10E.

First excited: 2*(1E) +1*(4E) +1*(9E) =2+4+9=15E.

Second excited: 2*(1E) +2*(9E)=2 + 18=20E.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the options are incorrect, but that's not an option here.

Wait, looking at option D: the energies are 10E,15E,18E. So the third energy is 18E. How can that happen?

Wait, 18E is 2E + 16E, which would be two particles in n=1 (2E) and two in n=4 (16E each → total 32E). No, that would sum to 34E.

Alternatively, 18E is 9E *2, so perhaps two particles in n=3. So 2E (n=1) + 18E (n=3) → 20E.

No, that doesn't help. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state isn't the sum of four particles, but just the next possible state for the highest energy particle. But that doesn't make sense because the total energy is the sum of all particles.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the energy levels as E, 4E, 9E, 16E, etc., and the ground state is the sum of the four lowest levels. But that's not the case; the ground state would have the lowest possible filling.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is not considering the Pauli exclusion. Like, maybe the particles are bosons. But the question says spin-1/2, which are fermions. So that can't be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering just the sum of the individual energies without considering that each level can hold two particles. But that would be incorrect for fermions.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering each possible state as a separate excitation, but I'm not getting anywhere.

Wait, looking at option D: 10E,15E,18E. So the second excited is 18E.

How can that sum be achieved?

Let me think: perhaps the configuration is n=1 (1), n=2 (1), n=3 (1), n=4 (1). So each particle in a different n. Each contributes E,4E,9E,16E.

Sum: E +4E +9E +16E=30E. But that's the ground state, which doesn't make sense because that's higher than our initial 10E.

So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the particles are not all spin-up or down, but arranged in a way that more can be in the same n. But no, that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the possibility of multiple particles in the same n beyond two, which is not allowed for spin-1/2 fermions. So perhaps the question is not considering the Pauli exclusion, treating the particles as bosons. But the problem states they are spin-1/2, so they must be fermions.

Wait, if the particles were bosons, then all four could be in n=1. So energy would be 4E, which is in option B (4E,10E,50E). But the question says spin-1/2, so I can't consider that.

Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something else. Let me think about the possible options again.

Option D's energies: ground state 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E.

How to get 18E. Only way I can think of is if the configuration is n=1 (2), n=2 (0), n=3 (1), n=4 (1). Sum is 2E +9E +16E=27E. Not matching.

Alternatively, maybe the configuration is n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). Sum 15E.

Then, the next step would be to have two particles in n=3 and one in n=4. But that would require five particles, which we don't have.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the energy levels for the system are considered as the sum of individual energies, without considering that each n can only hold two particles. So for four particles, the ground state would be the four lowest levels: n=1,2,3,4 filled with one particle each. But that would sum to E +4E +9E +16E=30E. But that's much higher than our initial 10E.

But then, the first excited state would be ... no, that can't be right because for fermions, each n can hold two particles. So the ground state can't have four particles each in their own n.

So I'm back to the initial conclusion that the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, and second excited 20E. But since none of the options have 20E, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the ground state as the lowest possible, but the first and second excited states are when some particles are promoted, but not necessarily all the way to the next n. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering each particle's energy as a separate term, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the way the energy levels are filled is different. Let me think about the possible arrangements again.

Ground state: n=1 (2 particles), n=2 (2 particles). Total energy 2E +8E=10E.

First excited state: n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). Sum 15E.

Second excited state: n=1 (2), n=2 (0), n=3 (2). Sum 2E +18E=20E.

But no option has 20E. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's not possible. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state isn't when both n=2 are promoted to n=3. Maybe one is promoted to n=3 and another to n=4. So configuration: n=1 (2), n=2 (0), n=3 (1), n=4 (1). Sum: 2E +9E +16E=27E.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when three particles are in n=2 and one in n=3, but that's impossible because n=2 can hold only two.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4, so configuration n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=4 (1). Sum:2E +4E +16E=22E. Not matching.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Let me think of another approach. Perhaps each particle's energy is E n², and the total energy is the sum of all of them.

Ground state: two in n=1 (each E), two in n=2 (each 4E). Sum: 2*1 + 2*4 =2 +8=10E.

First excited: two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. Sum:2 +4 +9=15E.

Second excited: two in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3. Sum:2 + 18=20E.

So the options don't have 20E. So perhaps the correct answer isn't present, but that can't be.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D has 10E,15E,18E. So perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4 (16E) and another in n=3 (9E). So the sum would be 2 (n=1) + 16 +9=27E. But that's not in the options.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=4. So sum is 2*(9E) +2*(16E)=18E +32E=50E. That's option A's last option.

But for four particles, that would require n=3 (2) and n=4 (2). So the sum is 18E +32E=50E. So that would be the second excited state? But that would make the options as ground state 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 50E. But option A has 30E, 39E,50E. So that doesn't align.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=4. But that would give a higher energy than the ground state, so that can't be.

I'm getting stuck here. Since time is limited, perhaps I should select option D, as it's the only one that starts with 10E and 15E. So the ground is 10E, first is 15E, second is 18E. Although I'm not sure how 18E is achieved, perhaps the configuration is n=1 (2), n=3 (2). So sum is 2E +18E=20E. But 20E isn't in the options. Alternatively, perhaps the configuration is n=2 (2), n=3 (2), which sums to 8E +18E=26E. Not matching.

Hmm. I'm stuck. But based on the options, option D is the only one that has 10E as the ground state. So I'll go with option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we analyze the system as follows:

### Key Concepts:
1. **Energy Levels in a 1D Infinite Potential Well**:  
   The energy levels are given by \( E_n = n^2 E \), where \( E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2} \) is the base energy unit, and \( n \) is the quantum number.

2. **Pauli Exclusion Principle**:  
   Since the particles are spin-1/2 fermions, each energy level \( n \) can hold at most two particles (one spin-up and one spin-down).

3. **Filling the Energy Levels**:  
   The particles will fill the lowest available energy levels first, with a maximum of two particles per level.

### Analysis:
#### Ground State:
- The lowest energy configuration is when two particles occupy \( n=1 \) and two particles occupy \( n=2 \).  
  - Energy contribution: \( 2E_1 + 2E_2 = 2E + 2(4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E \).  
  - **Ground State Energy**: \( 10E \).

#### First Excited State:
- The next higher energy configuration is when one particle is promoted from \( n=2 \) to \( n=3 \), resulting in two particles in \( n=1 \), one particle in \( n=2 \), and one particle in \( n=3 \).  
  - Energy contribution: \( 2E_1 + E_2 + E_3 = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E \).  
  - **First Excited State Energy**: \( 15E \).

#### Second Excited State:
- The next higher energy configuration is when another particle is promoted from \( n=2 \) to \( n=3 \), resulting in two particles in \( n=1 \) and two particles in \( n=3 \).  
  - Energy contribution: \( 2E_1 + 2E_3 = 2E + 2(9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E \).  
  - However, none of the provided options include \( 20E \).  

### Matching with Options:
The only option consistent with the calculated ground state (\( 10E \)) and first excited state (\( 15E \)) is **Option D**. While the second excited state in the calculations is \( 20E \), the problem's options suggest it is \( 18E \). This discrepancy may arise from a different interpretation of the second excited state, possibly involving a different configuration or scaling factor. Based on the given options, **Option D** is the most reasonable choice.

### Final Answer:
**Option D: 10E, 15E, 18E**

Answer: D

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this quantum mechanics problem. Let's see what it's about. The question is about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. I need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that in a 1D infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula for the energy levels is E_n = (n² π² ħ²) / (2mL²), where n is the principal quantum number. Oh wait, the question says E is given as pi² hbar squared over 2m L squared. So E is E_1, right? Because when n=1, E_1 = E. So any energy level would be E multiplied by the square of the quantum number.

But wait, the particles are identical fermions because they're spin-1/2. So they obey the Pauli exclusion principle, meaning each particle must occupy a unique quantum state. Or more precisely, each spatial state can hold a certain number of particles based on their spin.

In a 1D well, each energy level E_n can accommodate two particles because the spin can be up or down. So for each n, you can have two particles with opposite spins.

So for four particles, how are they filled? Let's think step by step.

The ground state would be the lowest energy configuration. So the particles will fill the lowest possible energy levels, each with the maximum number of particles allowed.

So for n=1: can hold 2 particles. Then n=2: another 2. So four particles in total. So in the ground state, we'll have two particles in n=1 and two in n=2. Wait, but wait—each energy level can hold two particles because spin up and down. So yes, n=1: 2 particles, n=2: 2 particles. So the total energy would be the sum of each particle's energy.

Wait, no. Each particle in n=1 contributes E_1, which is E. Each in n=2 contributes E_2, which is (2²)E =4E. So for two particles in n=1, their energy is 2E. Two in n=2: 2 * 4E=8E. So total energy for ground state is 2E +8E=10E.

Wait, but wait. No, wait a second. Wait, each particle in a particular n has energy E_n. So for four particles, in the ground state, two in n=1 and two in n=2. So the total energy is (2 * E_1) + (2 * E_2). E_1 is E, E_2 is 4E. So 2E + 8E=10E. So the ground state energy is 10E.

Wait, but wait another thing. Wait, the question is about the energies of the ground state, first excited, and second excited states. So the ground state is the lowest energy, which is 10E.

Now, what about the first excited state? The first excited state would be the next higher energy state that the system can occupy. But wait, the system's energy depends on how the particles are arranged. So when we have four particles, the ground state is filled with n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles). The next state would involve the next available energy level. So the first excited state would be when one of the particles from n=2 moves to a higher level, but keeping in mind that we have to obey the Pauli exclusion.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me think. Each energy level can hold two particles, one for each spin. So in the ground state, all the lower energy levels are filled: n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles). So what's the next possible configuration? The next available n is n=3. But since each level can only hold two, the next particle would have to go to n=3, but we already have four particles. Oh wait, no. Wait, no, the four particles are already in n=1 and n=2, each with two. So if we are considering the first excited state, perhaps one of the particles from n=2 moves up to n=3. But that might not be the case because that would increase the total energy, but maybe that's not the first excited state.

Wait, perhaps I'm thinking about it incorrectly. Let's think in terms of the possible states and how the particles are filled. The ground state has the lowest possible energy, which is when all the particles are in the lowest possible levels. So, for four fermions, with each n level holding 2, the filling is n=1 (2), n=2 (2)—so four particles.

Now, the first excited state would be when the highest occupied level is n=3. How? Because you can't have more than two particles in a single n level. So the first excited state would involve promoting one particle from n=2 to n=3. Or maybe it's when the next available level is filled.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, making the highest n=3. So the configuration would be n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). But wait, no, because each n can hold two particles. So perhaps the first excited state is when the filling is n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1), but that leaves two more particles? No, because we already have four particles. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when the configuration is n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). No, that's only four particles. So, in that case, the total energy would be (2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_3). E_1 is E, E_2 is 4E, E_3 is 9E.

So total energy is 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.

Wait, but wait. If the ground state is 10E, then the first excited state would be higher than that. So 15E would be the next possible energy.

Wait, but what about another scenario. Maybe the first excited state is when the configuration is n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). But that would require four particles. Wait, no: n=1 holds 2, n=2 holds 1, n=3 holds 1. That's four. So the total energy is 2*E + 1*(4E) + 1*(9E) = 2E +4E +9E=15E.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps the first excited state is when one of the particles in n=2 is promoted to n=3, but the other stays in n=2. So the energies would be 2E (from n=1) + (1*4E from n=2) + (1*9E from n=3) = 15E. So that's the first excited state.

Then, what about the second excited state? The second excited state would be the next higher energy. So perhaps another promotion happens, like moving another particle to a higher level. Or maybe promoting a particle from n=2 to n=4.

Wait, let's think. What's the next possible configuration after the first excited state. The next highest possible would be when two particles are in n=3 and none in n=4. But wait, each n can take two, so if I have n=1 (2), n=2 (0), n=3 (2), that's four particles. Wait, but n=2 can't be empty because you can have particles in higher n. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, another approach: The ground state is n=1 (2), n=2 (2). The first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, so the configuration is n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). The total energy would be 2E +4E +9E=15E. The second excited state would be when another particle moves up to n=3. So now, n=1 (2), n=2 (0), n=3 (2). So total energy is 2E +0 + 18E=20E. But wait, that's not matching any of the options. Hmm, the options given are:

A) 30E, 39E, 50E

B)4E,10E,50E

C)4E,10E,15E

D)10E,15E,18E

Wait, looking at option D: 10E,15E,18E. So the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E.

Wait, but when I thought about the second excited state as n=1 (2), n=2 (0), n=3 (2), that gives 2E (from n=1) + 2*9E=18E, so 2E +18E=20E. That doesn't match any of the options, so perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe the first excited state isn't moving a particle from n=2 to n=3. Maybe another configuration is possible. Let me think again. The ground state is four particles in n=1 and n=2. So what's the first possible higher energy state? Maybe the first excited state is when the particles are arranged as n=1 (2), n=2 (1), and n=3 (1), as I thought before, giving 15E. Then the second excited state would be when another particle moves up, say from n=2 to n=4. Let's see: n=1 (2), n=2 (0), n=3 (1), n=4 (1). So the energies would be 2E +0 +9E +16E=27E. But that's not an option either.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible energy levels for each state and sum them correctly. Let me list the possible states in order.

Ground state: n=1 (2), n=2 (2). Total energy: 2E + 2*4E = 10E.

First excited state: The next possible arrangement. Let me think: perhaps n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). So energies: 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Second excited state: Then, the next arrangement would be n=1 (2), n=2 (0), n=3 (2). So energies: 2E +0 + 2*9E= 20E. But none of the options have 20E. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4. So perhaps n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1), and n=4 (0), but that's only four particles. No, that's not the case. Wait, maybe another configuration where particles are in higher n.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when particles are in n=1 (2), n=3 (2). So the total energy would be 2E + 2*9E=20E. But then 20E would be the first excited state, which doesn't match any of the options either.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe I should think in terms of the total possible energy states and not the individual particles. Wait, each particle's energy contributes to the total. So for the ground state, it's the sum of the lowest possible energies for four particles.

Each energy level can hold two particles. So the four particles are filled as n=1 (2), n=2 (2). So the total energy is 2E (from n=1) + 2*4E (from n=2)=2E +8E=10E.

Then, the first excited state would have the next possible configuration, which is n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). So the total energy is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

The second excited state would be the next possible configuration. Here, perhaps n=1 (2), n=3 (2). But wait, can n=3 hold two particles? Yes. So the configuration would be n=1 (2), n=2 (0), n=3 (2). So the energy is 2E + 2*9E=2E +18E=20E. But none of the options have 20E. Hmm.

Looking at the options, option D has energies of 10E, 15E, 18E. So the third energy level is 18E. How do we reach 18E? Let's see: 18E is 9E * 2, which would be two particles in n=3 (each contributing 9E, but wait, 9E is the energy for a single particle in n=3, so two would add 18E. So the configuration would be n=1 (2), n=3 (2). So the sum is 2E + 2*9E=2E +18E=20E. That's not matching 18E.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4. Let's see: 4^2=16, so E_4=16E. So if the configuration is n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1), n=4 (0), but that's four particles. Alternatively, perhaps n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=4 (1). So their energies: 2E +4E +16E=22E. Still not matching.

Alternatively, maybe the second excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=4. Let's see: n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=4 (1). So the sum is 2E +4E +16E=22E. Not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me list the possible energy levels:

n: 1 → E= E.

n: 2 → E=4E.

n:3 → E=9E.

n:4 → E=16E.

n:5 →25E, etc.

Now, the ground state is 2 particles in n=1 and 2 in n=2: 2E + 8E =10E.

The first excited state would be when the highest possible is n=3. So perhaps, one particle from n=2 moves to n=3, making the configuration n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). So total energy is 2E +4E +9E =15E.

The second excited state would then be when another particle from n=2 moves to n=3, so the configuration is n=1 (2), n=2 (0), n=3 (2). So the energy is 2E + 0 + 18E=20E.

But again, none of the options have 20E. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, looking at the options, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=5. But that would be E=25E, which seems too high.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4, so E=16E. So configuration would be n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=4 (1). So energies: 2E +4E +16E=22E.

Hmm, not matching any option.

Wait, looking at the options, option C has 4E, 10E, 15E. But the ground state is 10E, which is the sum of 2E (n=1) and 8E (n=2). So option C's ground state is 4E, which doesn't make sense. So option C is out.

Option B: 4, 10,50. The ground state is 4E, which would be two particles in n=1 (2E) and none in n=2? No, because four particles would need to be in n=1 and n=2. So option B's ground state is 4E, which is only possible if all four particles are in n=2. But each n can hold two particles, so n=2 can have two. So that would leave two more particles, but there's no room in n=2. So that can't be. So option B is incorrect.

Option A: 30E, 39E,50E. That seems way too high.

Option D: 10E, 15E, 18E. So ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E.

Wait, how would I get 18E? Let's see. 18E could be 2E from n=1 and 16E from n=4.

Wait, 2E + 16E=18E. But that would require two particles in n=1 and two in n=4, but wait, no—because four particles would be two in n=1 and two in n=4. So the total energy would be 2E (n=1) + 2*(16E) = 2E +32E=34E. Which doesn't match any option.

Alternatively, maybe the configuration for the second excited state is two particles in n=3. So 2*(9E)=18E plus 2E from n=1. So 2E +18E=20E. Again, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=5, but that's 25E, which is not in the options.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the first excited state is when the configuration is n=1 (2), n=3 (2). So the energies would be 2E + 18E=20E. But again, that's not matching any option.

Hmm, this is confusing. Let me think again. Maybe the first excited state isn't n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). Perhaps another arrangement is possible.

Wait, perhaps the energy levels are filled as follows:

Ground state: n=1 (2), n=2 (2) → energy sum 10E.

First excited state: n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1) → 15E.

Second excited state: n=1 (2), n=2 (0), n=3 (2) → 20E.

But none of the options have 20E. The options' highest is 50E, which is way higher.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in how the particles are filled. Because in a 1D well, each particle's state is determined by n and spin. So each n can hold two particles (spin up and down). So maybe the filling is more about the individual levels.

Wait, another approach: For four spin-1/2 particles, the ground state would have the lowest possible energies, so two in n=1 and two in n=2. So the total energy is 2E + 8E =10E.

The first excited state would be moving one of the n=2 particles to n=3, so the configuration is n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). The energy is 2E +4E +9E =15E.

The second excited state would be moving another n=2 particle to n=3, making n=3 (2). So energy would be 2E + 0 + 18E=20E. But the option D says second excited is 18E. So that would be 2E + 16E=18E, which would be two particles in n=4. But that would require n=1 (2), n=4 (2). So 2E + 2*16E=34E. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state has one particle in n=4 and others in lower levels. For example, n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=4 (1). The energy would be 2E +4E +16E=22E. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of adding the next possible state. Let's list all possible states in order of increasing energy.

Ground state: 10E.

First excited: 15E.

Second excited: 18E. How?

Wait, 18E would be 2E (from n=1) + 16E (from n=4). But that's two particles: 2 in n=1 and 2 in n=4? No, that would be four particles, so 2E + 2*16E=34E. Not 18E.

Wait, 18E is 9E *2. So two particles in n=3. So 2E (n=1) + 2*9E=2E +18E=20E.

Hmm. Maybe the second excited state is when particles are in n=3 (2) and n=4 (0). So 2E (n=1) + 18E (n=3) →20E.

But this is not matching any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the energies are calculated differently. Maybe the energy for each particle is E_n = n^2 E, where E is the base energy (E_1). So for four particles, the ground state is the sum of the four lowest possible E_n's, each multiplied by the appropriate number of particles, but considering that each n can hold up to two.

So for four particles:

n=1: 2 particles → energy 2E.

n=2: 2 particles → 2*(4E)=8E.

Total ground state: 10E.

First excited: perhaps one particle promoted to n=3. So particles in n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). So energy is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Second excited: another particle promoted to n=3. Now, n=3 has two particles. So energy is 2E + 0 (n=2 has 0, because all two particles in n=2 have been promoted to n=3 and n=4? Wait, no. Let me see.

Wait, in four particles, after promoting two to n=3, that would require n=3 to hold two particles. So configuration would be n=1 (2), n=3 (2). So the sum is 2E + 2*9E=2E +18E=20E.

But the options don't have 20E. So perhaps I'm missing another way.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when the particles are arranged as n=1 (2), n=2 (0), n=3 (2). So two in n=3, which gives 2*9E=18E. So the total energy is 2E +18E=20E. But the options don't have this.

Wait, looking back at the options, option D's second excited state is 18E. That would imply that the total energy is 18E. How?

If the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E. Let's see:

10E → 2E + 8E (n=1 and n=2).

15E →2E +4E +9E.

18E → perhaps 2E +16E (n=4). But that's 2E +16E=18E. But that would require two particles in n=1 and two in n=4. So the configuration would be n=1 (2), n=4 (2). So energy is 2E + 2*(16E)=34E, which doesn't match 18E.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and the other in n=4. So the configuration would be n=1 (2), n=3 (1), n=4 (1). So energy would be 2E + 9E +16E=27E. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible total energies.

Option D: 10E (ground), 15E (first excited), 18E (second excited).

So the second excited state energy is 18E. How could that happen?

If the configuration is n=1 (2), n=2 (0), n=3 (1), n=4 (1). So the sum is 2E + 9E +16E=27E. Not 18E.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when the configuration is n=1 (2), n=3 (2). Which would give 2E + 2*9E=2E +18E=20E.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should consider that the second excited state is when the highest level is n=4, but only one particle is there. So configuration would be n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=4 (1). So sum is 2E +4E +16E=22E. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the first excited state isn't when a particle moves to n=3, but perhaps when a particle moves to n=4. Let me see: configuration n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=4 (1). So sum is 2E +4E +16E=22E. But that's higher than the first excited state.

Wait, no, because moving a particle to a higher n would result in a higher energy, so the first excited state must be lower than the second. So the configuration with one particle in n=3 (15E) is the first excited state, and then the next is when another particle moves to n=3 (20E), or one moves to n=4 (22E).

But none of these match the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the total energy as the sum of the individual energies, but considering that the particles are fermions and their wavefunctions are antisymmetric, but that doesn't change the energy. So perhaps the correct approach is to fill the lowest possible levels.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the first excited state isn't when a particle moves to n=3, but when a particle moves to a higher energy level, but perhaps spin states are considered differently. No, spin states are accounted for by the two particles per n level.

Wait, perhaps the ground state is when all four particles are in the same n level. But that's impossible because each n can hold only two. So the ground state must have two in n=1 and two in n=2.

So I'm back to the initial conclusion: ground state is 10E. First excited state is 15E. Second excited state is 20E. But the options don't have 20E.

But looking at the options, option D has 10E,15E,18E. So perhaps the second excited state is when the configuration is n=1 (2), n=3 (2), but that would be 2E + 18E=20E, which isn't 18E. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when three particles are in n=2 and one in n=3. But that can't happen because each n can hold two particles. So three in n=2 is impossible.

Wait, maybe the first excited state is 15E, and the second excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=4, but another is promoted to n=3. So the configuration is n=1 (2), n=3 (1), n=4 (1). So the sum is 2E +9E +16E=27E. But that's not in the options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something in the way the energy levels are calculated. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the sum of the individual energies without considering the maximum number of particles per level. But that can't be, because the particles are fermions and must obey the Pauli exclusion.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the particles as spin-1/2 but not accounting for the Pauli principle. But the question states they are spin-1/2, so they must obey it.

Wait, another approach: Let's list the possible energy levels for each possible state.

The ground state has the lowest possible total energy, which is when the four particles are in the lowest possible levels. So two in n=1 and two in n=2: 2E +8E=10E.

The first excited state would be the next possible arrangement. So perhaps one particle from n=2 moves to n=3, giving n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). So energy is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

The second excited state would then be when another particle is promoted. So either another moves to n=3, making n=3 (2), so energy 2E + 18E=20E. Or one moves to n=4, making the configuration n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=4 (1), which sums to 2E +4E +16E=22E.

But the options don't have 20E or 22E.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when the configuration is n=1 (2), n=2 (0), n=3 (2). So sum is 2E + 18E=20E.

But option D's second excited is 18E, which doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the total energy as the sum of the squares of the quantum numbers, but scaled differently. Let me calculate the energies for each possible configuration again.

n=1: E=1²E=1E.

n=2: 4E.

n=3:9E.

n=4:16E.

So for four particles:

Ground state: 2*(1E) + 2*(4E) =2E +8E=10E.

First excited: 2*(1E) +1*(4E) +1*(9E) =2+4+9=15E.

Second excited: 2*(1E) +2*(9E)=2 + 18=20E.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the options are incorrect, but that's not an option here.

Wait, looking at option D: the energies are 10E,15E,18E. So the third energy is 18E. How can that happen?

Wait, 18E is 2E + 16E, which would be two particles in n=1 (2E) and two in n=4 (16E each → total 32E). No, that would sum to 34E.

Alternatively, 18E is 9E *2, so perhaps two particles in n=3. So 2E (n=1) + 18E (n=3) → 20E.

No, that doesn't help. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state isn't the sum of four particles, but just the next possible state for the highest energy particle. But that doesn't make sense because the total energy is the sum of all particles.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the energy levels as E, 4E, 9E, 16E, etc., and the ground state is the sum of the four lowest levels. But that's not the case; the ground state would have the lowest possible filling.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is not considering the Pauli exclusion. Like, maybe the particles are bosons. But the question says spin-1/2, which are fermions. So that can't be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering just the sum of the individual energies without considering that each level can hold two particles. But that would be incorrect for fermions.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering each possible state as a separate excitation, but I'm not getting anywhere.

Wait, looking at option D: 10E,15E,18E. So the second excited is 18E.

How can that sum be achieved?

Let me think: perhaps the configuration is n=1 (1), n=2 (1), n=3 (1), n=4 (1). So each particle in a different n. Each contributes E,4E,9E,16E.

Sum: E +4E +9E +16E=30E. But that's the ground state, which doesn't make sense because that's higher than our initial 10E.

So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the particles are not all spin-up or down, but arranged in a way that more can be in the same n. But no, that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the possibility of multiple particles in the same n beyond two, which is not allowed for spin-1/2 fermions. So perhaps the question is not considering the Pauli exclusion, treating the particles as bosons. But the problem states they are spin-1/2, so they must be fermions.

Wait, if the particles were bosons, then all four could be in n=1. So energy would be 4E, which is in option B (4E,10E,50E). But the question says spin-1/2, so I can't consider that.

Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something else. Let me think about the possible options again.

Option D's energies: ground state 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E.

How to get 18E. Only way I can think of is if the configuration is n=1 (2), n=2 (0), n=3 (1), n=4 (1). Sum is 2E +9E +16E=27E. Not matching.

Alternatively, maybe the configuration is n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). Sum 15E.

Then, the next step would be to have two particles in n=3 and one in n=4. But that would require five particles, which we don't have.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the energy levels for the system are considered as the sum of individual energies, without considering that each n can only hold two particles. So for four particles, the ground state would be the four lowest levels: n=1,2,3,4 filled with one particle each. But that would sum to E +4E +9E +16E=30E. But that's much higher than our initial 10E.

But then, the first excited state would be ... no, that can't be right because for fermions, each n can hold two particles. So the ground state can't have four particles each in their own n.

So I'm back to the initial conclusion that the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, and second excited 20E. But since none of the options have 20E, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the ground state as the lowest possible, but the first and second excited states are when some particles are promoted, but not necessarily all the way to the next n. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering each particle's energy as a separate term, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the way the energy levels are filled is different. Let me think about the possible arrangements again.

Ground state: n=1 (2 particles), n=2 (2 particles). Total energy 2E +8E=10E.

First excited state: n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). Sum 15E.

Second excited state: n=1 (2), n=2 (0), n=3 (2). Sum 2E +18E=20E.

But no option has 20E. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's not possible. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state isn't when both n=2 are promoted to n=3. Maybe one is promoted to n=3 and another to n=4. So configuration: n=1 (2), n=2 (0), n=3 (1), n=4 (1). Sum: 2E +9E +16E=27E.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when three particles are in n=2 and one in n=3, but that's impossible because n=2 can hold only two.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4, so configuration n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=4 (1). Sum:2E +4E +16E=22E. Not matching.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Let me think of another approach. Perhaps each particle's energy is E n², and the total energy is the sum of all of them.

Ground state: two in n=1 (each E), two in n=2 (each 4E). Sum: 2*1 + 2*4 =2 +8=10E.

First excited: two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. Sum:2 +4 +9=15E.

Second excited: two in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3. Sum:2 + 18=20E.

So the options don't have 20E. So perhaps the correct answer isn't present, but that can't be.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D has 10E,15E,18E. So perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4 (16E) and another in n=3 (9E). So the sum would be 2 (n=1) + 16 +9=27E. But that's not in the options.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=4. So sum is 2*(9E) +2*(16E)=18E +32E=50E. That's option A's last option.

But for four particles, that would require n=3 (2) and n=4 (2). So the sum is 18E +32E=50E. So that would be the second excited state? But that would make the options as ground state 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 50E. But option A has 30E, 39E,50E. So that doesn't align.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=4. But that would give a higher energy than the ground state, so that can't be.

I'm getting stuck here. Since time is limited, perhaps I should select option D, as it's the only one that starts with 10E and 15E. So the ground is 10E, first is 15E, second is 18E. Although I'm not sure how 18E is achieved, perhaps the configuration is n=1 (2), n=3 (2). So sum is 2E +18E=20E. But 20E isn't in the options. Alternatively, perhaps the configuration is n=2 (2), n=3 (2), which sums to 8E +18E=26E. Not matching.

Hmm. I'm stuck. But based on the options, option D is the only one that has 10E as the ground state. So I'll go with option D.


To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we analyze the system as follows:

### Key Concepts:
1. **Energy Levels in a 1D Infinite Potential Well**:  
   The energy levels are given by \( E_n = n^2 E \), where \( E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2} \) is the base energy unit, and \( n \) is the quantum number.

2. **Pauli Exclusion Principle**:  
   Since the particles are spin-1/2 fermions, each energy level \( n \) can hold at most two particles (one spin-up and one spin-down).

3. **Filling the Energy Levels**:  
   The particles will fill the lowest available energy levels first, with a maximum of two particles per level.

### Analysis:
#### Ground State:
- The lowest energy configuration is when two particles occupy \( n=1 \) and two particles occupy \( n=2 \).  
  - Energy contribution: \( 2E_1 + 2E_2 = 2E + 2(4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E \).  
  - **Ground State Energy**: \( 10E \).

#### First Excited State:
- The next higher energy configuration is when one particle is promoted from \( n=2 \) to \( n=3 \), resulting in two particles in \( n=1 \), one particle in \( n=2 \), and one particle in \( n=3 \).  
  - Energy contribution: \( 2E_1 + E_2 + E_3 = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E \).  
  - **First Excited State Energy**: \( 15E \).

#### Second Excited State:
- The next higher energy configuration is when another particle is promoted from \( n=2 \) to \( n=3 \), resulting in two particles in \( n=1 \) and two particles in \( n=3 \).  
  - Energy contribution: \( 2E_1 + 2E_3 = 2E + 2(9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E \).  
  - However, none of the provided options include \( 20E \).  

### Matching with Options:
The only option consistent with the calculated ground state (\( 10E \)) and first excited state (\( 15E \)) is **Option D**. While the second excited state in the calculations is \( 20E \), the problem's options suggest it is \( 18E \). This discrepancy may arise from a different interpretation of the second excited state, possibly involving a different configuration or scaling factor. Based on the given options, **Option D** is the most reasonable choice.

### Final Answer:
**Option D: 10E, 15E, 18E**

Answer: D
