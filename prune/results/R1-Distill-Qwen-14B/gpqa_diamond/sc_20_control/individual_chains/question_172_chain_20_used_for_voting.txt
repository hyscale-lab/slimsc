Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I remember that when stars are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels follows the Boltzmann equation. 

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. I need to find the correct equation relating their temperatures T1 and T2.

Wait, the Boltzmann distribution formula comes to mind. The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by (n2/n1) = exp(-ΔE/(k*T)). So here, n1 is the number of atoms in the lower energy level, and n2 is the upper. But wait, in this question, the higher energy level is more excited. Oh, wait no, actually, the number of excited states would be higher in the higher energy level. Wait, but the problem says the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So for each atom, the probability of being in the higher energy level is higher.

So for star_1, the ratio is n_upper_1 / n_lower_1 = 2. Similarly, for star_2, n_upper_2 / n_lower_2 = let's say x. But wait, the problem says star_1's atoms are twice as excited as star_2's. So n_upper_1/n_lower_1 = 2*(n_upper_2/n_lower_2). Or maybe the ratio of the excitation in star_1 to that in star_2 is 2:1. So (n_upper_1 / n_lower_1) = 2 * (n_upper_2 / n_lower_2).

Wait, but I think the question is that the excitation level is twice. So in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So maybe the excitation ratio is (n_upper /n_lower) for star 1 is twice that of star 2.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is that the number of atoms in the excited state (higher energy) in star_1 is twice that in star_2. But the problem says "twice as excited in a specific energy level," which I think refers to the ratio n_upper/n_lower being twice as much for star_1 compared to star_2.

So the formula would be (n_upper_1 / n_lower_1) = 2*(n_upper_2 / n_lower_2).

Using the Boltzmann equation, each of these ratios is exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), but wait, wait: no, the Boltzmann factor is for the ratio of the upper to lower level. The correct formula is (n_upper / n_lower) = exp(-ΔE/(k*T)). Because the higher energy level is less populated, so the ratio is exponential of negative delta E over kT.

So for star_1: (n_upper_1 / n_lower_1) = exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)) = 2*(n_upper_2 / n_lower_2)

But for star_2: (n_upper_2 / n_lower_2) = exp(-ΔE/(k*T2)).

So substituting, star_1's ratio is 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k*T2)).

Therefore:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Taking natural log on both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2).

Let me rearrange terms:

- ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2).

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [1/(T2) - 1/(T1)] = ln(2).

Wait, wait. Let me see:

- (ΔE)/(k T1) + (ΔE)/(k T2) = ln(2).

Factor ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ] = ln(2).

Hmm, but that's the same as:

ΔE/(k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2).

Because (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) [ (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ]

But wait, the question gives the energy difference ΔE, but I don't see it in the options. Oh, the options only involve ln(2) and the temperatures T1 and T2.

Wait, but the question's options don't have any terms with ΔE or k. So perhaps the options are assuming that the expression for ln(2) is in terms of T1 and T2, and the other constants (ΔE and k) are accounted for.

Wait, but in the equation I derived, ln(2) equals (ΔE/(k)) multiplied by (T1-T2)/(T1*T2). So the equation is:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) * (T1-T2)/(T1 T2).

But in the options, all the choices only have T1 and T2. So I must have made a mistake, perhaps in how I set up the ratio.

Wait, maybe I should think of the ratio as (n_upper_1) / (n_lower_1) = 2 * (n_upper_2)/(n_lower_2).

But since each (n_upper)/(n_lower) is exp(-ΔE/(k T)), so:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Dividing both sides by exp(-ΔE/(k T2)), we get:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ) = 2.

Take ln of both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2).

Factor ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) = ln(2).

Which can be rewritten as:

ΔE/(k) ( (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2).

So:

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] * (T1 - T2)/(T1*T2).

But none of the options have ΔE or Boltzmann's constant k. So perhaps the question expects me to assume that the ΔE/(k) term is a constant, and thus the equation is ln(2) equals (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2), but looking at the options that's not exactly what's given.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Option C is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)^2.

So according to my equation, it's (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) multiplied by some constant. But the options don't include any constants, so perhaps the question is assuming that ΔE/(k) is 1, but that's not realistic. Oh wait, maybe the energy difference is given, but in the equation, the constants are taken into account.

Wait, but the question gives the energy difference (ΔE) as 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly the value of Boltzmann's constant k (approx 1.38e-23 J/K). So ΔE = k. Oh wait, because k is 1.38e-23 J/K, and ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. So ΔE = k*T, but wait, but in this equation, ΔE is just given as a specific value. Let me see.

Wait, wait. If ΔE = 1.38e-23 J, and k is also 1.38e-23 J/K, then ΔE = k * (1 K).

So ΔE/(k) = 1 K.

Wait, that's a crucial point. Because ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is equal to k, since k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE = k * (1 K).

So ΔE/(k) = 1 K.

So going back to my equation:

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Since ΔE/(k) = 1 K, this simplifies to:

ln(2) = [1 K] * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

But wait, the units here would be K multiplied by (K^{-1}) [since T1 and T2 are in K, their reciprocals are 1/K, and T1 T2 is K^2, so 1/(K^2). So (1/K^2) multiplied by K gives 1/K, which doesn't make sense. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in unit analysis, but perhaps that's not the right path.

Wait, maybe I should approach the problem without considering units, since the options don't involve any constants. Let's proceed with the equation:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

But since ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, and k is 1.38e-23 J/K, so ΔE = k.

So substituting ΔE = k:

ln(2) = (k / k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So the equation becomes ln(2) equals (T1 - T2)/(T1 * T2). So looking at the options, which one matches this?

Option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So the correct equation would be option D.

Wait, but let me double-check the initial setup. Did I get the ratio correct? So for star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. So the ratio is (n_upper_1/n_lower_1) = 2*(n_upper_2/n_lower_2).

Yes, that's correct. And using the Boltzmann equation for both, leading to the derived equation.

To solve the problem, we use the Boltzmann distribution, which relates the ratio of populations in two energy levels to the temperature of the system. For a specific energy level, the ratio of the number of atoms in the upper energy level to the lower energy level is given by:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature.

The problem states that the excitation level in star_1 is twice that in star_2. This implies:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper,1}}}{n_{\text{lower,1}}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{\text{upper,2}}}{n_{\text{lower,2}}}.
\]

Using the Boltzmann equation for both stars:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper,1}}}{n_{\text{lower,1}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right),
\]
\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper,2}}}{n_{\text{lower,2}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
\]

Substituting the second equation into the first:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
\]

Dividing through by \( \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right) \):

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1} + \frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right) = 2.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1} + \frac{\Delta E}{kT_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Factoring out \( \Delta E / k \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Rewriting \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \) as \( \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

The problem specifies that \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), which is equal to the Boltzmann constant \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \). Thus, \( \Delta E / k = 1 \). Substituting this into the equation:

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

This matches the form of option D. Therefore, the correct equation is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
