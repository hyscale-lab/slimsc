Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the angle between the directions of the two photons produced after an electron and positron collision. Hmm, let's see. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that when a particle and its antiparticle annihilate, they produce photons. In this case, an electron and a positron collide and annihilate, creating two photons. The problem says both photons have the same energy. Oh, right, because energy and momentum have to be conserved in this process.

Wait, so the initial setup is that the electron is moving from the left along the horizontal axis with a Lorentz factor of 4. The positron is moving from the right, also along the horizontal, with a Lorentz factor of 2. So, their velocities are in opposite directions, along the same axis.

I think Lorentz factor is gamma, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So, for the electron, gamma is 4, and for the positron, gamma is 2. But wait, the positron is moving in the opposite direction. Do I need to consider their velocities as vectors?

Right, because direction matters for momentum. So, let me think about their momenta. The momentum p is gamma * m * v. But since they're moving in opposite directions, their momenta will be opposite in direction. But wait, the positron has a lower gamma, so its momentum might be smaller. Let me calculate their individual momenta.

Wait, but the electron and positron have the same mass, right? Because they are each other's antiparticles with the same mass. So, m_e for both. So, I can compute their momenta.

The electron's gamma is 4, so p_electron = gamma * m_e * v_e. Similarly, p_positron = gamma_positron * m_e * v_positron.

But wait, I don't know the velocities exactly. Hmm, but maybe I can find the total momentum before annihilation. Because after annihilation, the two photons must carry away momentum such that the total momentum is conserved.

Wait, the initial system is the electron and positron. Let me compute their total momentum. Since they are moving towards each other, their momenta would add.

Wait, but the positron is moving from the right, so let's set up a coordinate system. Let me take the positive x-direction to the right. So, the electron is moving to the right (since it's moving from the left towards the right), and the positron is moving to the left (since it's moving from the right towards the left). So, their momenta are in opposite directions.

Wait, no. Wait, the positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right. So in the positive x-direction, the electron is moving from left to right, and the positron is moving from right to left. So their velocities are in opposite directions. So their momenta will be opposite in sign.

Wait, so the electron's velocity is positive (to the right), and the positron's velocity is negative (to the left). So their momenta would be p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e, and p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p, but v_p is negative. So p_p would be negative.

Wait, but let's be precise. Let me compute the momentum of each particle.

First, compute velocities using Lorentz factors. For the electron, gamma_e =4. So, gamma_e = 1 / sqrt(1 - v_e²/c²) → 4 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v_e²/c²). Squaring both sides, 16 = 1/(1 - v_e²/c²), so 1 - v_e²/c² = 1/16 → v_e²/c² =15/16 → v_e = c * sqrt(15/16) = c*(√15)/4.

Similarly, for the positron, gamma_p =2. So, gamma_p=1/sqrt(1 - v_p²/c²) → 2=1/sqrt(...), so square to 4=1/(1 - v_p²/c²) → 1 - v_p²/c²=1/4 → v_p²/c²=3/4 → v_p = c*(√3)/2.

Wait, but since the positron is moving to the left, its velocity is negative. So, v_p = - (√3/2)c.

Now, the momenta: 

p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e =4 * m_e * (√15/4)c = m_e * √15 * c.

p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p = 2 * m_e * (-√3/2 c) = - m_e * √3 * c.

So, the total momentum before collision is p_total = p_e + p_p = m_e c (√15 - √3).

Wait, but wait, electron and positron are annihilating, so their combined momentum must equal the total momentum of the photons. Since photons carry momentum, the total momentum after annihilation is the sum of the momenta of the two photons.

Now, the problem states that both photons have the same energy. Since the energy of a photon is E = |p| c, same energy implies same |p| for each photon. So each photon has p_photon = E/(c^2) * c = E/(c), but wait no, E_photon = p_photon c → p_photon = E_photon / c.

But since both photons have the same energy, their momenta magnitudes are equal. So, p1 = E/c and p2 = E/c.

But their directions could be different. Let me think about the directions. The problem says one photon is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. So both are moving to the right, but in different vertical directions. So, their momenta vectors are symmetric around the x-axis.

Hmm, but wait, the initial total momentum is in the x-direction. So, the total momentum after must also be in the x-direction. So the sum of the two photons' momenta must equal p_total.

Each photon's momentum has components: for the first, (p_x1, p_y1), and the second, (p_x2, p_y2). The sum p_x1 + p_x2 must equal p_total, and p_y1 + p_y2 must equal zero (since the initial system has zero net y-momentum).

Given the setup, the two photons are moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions. So, their y-components are in opposite directions. Let's say photon 1 is moving at an angle theta above the x-axis, and photon 2 is moving at theta below, making their y-components equal in magnitude but opposite in sign.

Wait, but given the problem statement, they have the same energy, which gives same |p|. So, for each photon, |p| = E/c = same. Let's denote the magnitude as p.

So, their x-components are p cos(theta) and p cos(theta), and their y-components are p sin(theta) and -p sin(theta), respectively. Because the angles are symmetric, so if photon 1 has an angle theta above the x-axis, photon 2 has theta below.

But wait, let me visualize. Both photons are moving to the right, but one is upper-right and the other is lower-right. So, their x-components are positive (since moving right), and their y-components are opposite.

So, the sum of the y-components is p sin(theta) - p sin(theta) =0, which is correct because initial momentum had no y-component.

The sum of the x-components is p cos(theta) + p cos(theta) = 2 p cos(theta). This must equal the total initial momentum p_total = m_e c (√15 - √3).

So, 2 p cos(theta) = m_e c (√15 -√3).

But wait, what's p? p is the magnitude of each photon's momentum, which is E/c. But the energy of each photon comes from the annihilation, which is the rest mass energy times some factor.

Wait, the rest mass of an electron is m_e c². When an electron and positron annihilate, they produce energy equal to 2 m_e c². But wait, in this case, they're moving, so their total energy would be their rest mass plus kinetic energy.

Wait, but wait. The total energy of the system before annihilation is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron.

Each particle's energy is gamma m_e c². So, total energy E_total = gamma_e m_e c² + gamma_p m_e c² = [4 + 2] m_e c² = 6 m_e c².

After annihilation, this energy is converted into the energy of the two photons. Since each photon has E_photon = same value, so 2 E_photon =6 m_e c² → E_photon =3 m_e c².

Wait, that can't be right. Because 2 photons each with E=3 m_e c² would sum to 6 m_e c². But that would require that the initial energy was 6 m_e c², which is correct.

Wait, but wait, the rest mass is m_e c² each, so together 2 m_e c². But since they are moving, their total energy is more. So yes, 4 m_e c² + 2 m_e c² =6 m_e c².

So, each photon has E=3 m_e c² → p_photon = E/c =3 m_e c.

So, each photon's momentum is 3 m_e c, and direction is symmetric. So, their x-components are 3 m_e c cos(theta), and y-components are 3 m_e c sin(theta) and -3 m_e c sin(theta).

So, the sum of the x-components is 3 m_e c cos(theta) +3 m_e c cos(theta) =6 m_e c cos(theta).

This sum must equal the initial total momentum in the x-direction, which was m_e c (√15 -√3).

So, 6 m_e c cos(theta) = m_e c (√15 -√3).

We can cancel m_e c from both sides:

6 cos(theta) = √15 -√3.

So, cos(theta) = (√15 -√3)/(6).

Hmm, let me compute that numerically.

First, compute √15 ≈ 3.87298, √3≈1.73205. So √15 -√3 ≈ 3.87298 -1.73205=2.14093.

Divide by 6 → 2.14093 /6 ≈0.35682.

So, cos(theta) ≈0.35682. Then theta is arccos(0.35682) ≈69 degrees. Wait, because cos(60)=0.5, cos(70)≈0.3420, so 0.3568 is between 69 and 70 degrees. Let's say approximately 69.3 degrees.

Wait, but this theta is the angle each photon makes with the x-axis. Since one is above and the other is below, the angle between the two photons would be 2 theta.

So, 2 *69.3≈138.6 degrees. Which is approximately 138 degrees. Looking at the options, option C is 138, which would be the answer.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, the total initial momentum is p_total = p_e + p_p.

Wait earlier I calculated p_e = m_e c sqrt(15) and p_p = -m_e c sqrt(3), so p_total is m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Wait, yes. Then for the photons, each has p_photon =3 m_e c, so their x-components are 3 m_e c cos(theta), and sum to 6 m_e c cos(theta). So, 6 m_e c cos(theta) = m_e c (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)) → 6 cos(theta) = sqrt(15)-sqrt(3).

Wait, yes.

Wait, but sqrt(15) is 3.872, sqrt(3)=1.732, so sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)= ~2.140.

So 2.140 /6 = ~0.3567.

So theta is arccos(0.3567) ≈69 degrees.

So the angle between the two photons is 2 theta, so 138 degrees.

Looking at the options, option C is 138, so that's the answer.

To solve the problem, we analyze the collision and annihilation of an electron and a positron, conserving energy and momentum. The electron and positron move along the horizontal axis with Lorentz factors of 4 and 2, respectively. After annihilation, they produce two photons of equal energy, moving in upper-right and lower-right directions. The goal is to determine the angle between the photons' directions.

### Step 1: Initial Momentum
The electron and positron have equal masses, \( m_e \), and their velocities are determined using their Lorentz factors:
- For the electron (\( \gamma_e = 4 \)):  
  \[
  \gamma_e = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_e^2/c^2}} \implies v_e = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_e^2}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{16}} = c \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4}.
  \]
  Momentum of the electron:
  \[
  p_e = \gamma_e m_e v_e = 4 m_e c \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4} = m_e c \sqrt{15}.
  \]

- For the positron (\( \gamma_p = 2 \)):  
  \[
  \gamma_p = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_p^2/c^2}} \implies v_p = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_p^2}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{4}} = c \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
  \]
  Momentum of the positron (note it moves in the opposite direction):
  \[
  p_p = \gamma_p m_e v_p = 2 m_e c \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = m_e c \sqrt{3}.
  \]

The total momentum before annihilation is:
\[
p_{\text{total}} = p_e - p_p = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}).
\]

### Step 2: Momentum of Photons
After annihilation, the two photons have equal energies (\( E_1 = E_2 \)) and thus equal magnitudes of momentum (\( p_1 = p_2 = \frac{E}{c} \)). Since the photons move symmetrically in the upper-right and lower-right directions, their momentum components are:
- Photon 1: \( p_{1x} = p \cos\theta \), \( p_{1y} = p \sin\theta \),
- Photon 2: \( p_{2x} = p \cos\theta \), \( p_{2y} = -p \sin\theta \).

The total momentum in the \( y \)-direction must be zero (\( p_{1y} + p_{2y} = 0 \)), which is satisfied. The total momentum in the \( x \)-direction is:
\[
p_{\text{total}} = p_{1x} + p_{2x} = 2p \cos\theta.
\]

Equating this to the initial momentum:
\[
2p \cos\theta = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}).
\]

### Step 3: Energy of Photons
The total energy of the system before annihilation is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = \gamma_e m_e c^2 + \gamma_p m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2.
\]
After annihilation, this energy is converted into the energy of the two photons:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2E_1 \implies E_1 = 3 m_e c^2.
\]
Thus, the momentum of each photon is:
\[
p = \frac{E_1}{c} = \frac{3 m_e c^2}{c} = 3 m_e c.
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( \theta \)
Substituting \( p = 3 m_e c \) into the momentum equation:
\[
2 (3 m_e c) \cos\theta = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}),
\]
\[
6 \cos\theta = \sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}.
\]
Simplify:
\[
\cos\theta = \frac{\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}}{6}.
\]
Numerically:
\[
\sqrt{15} \approx 3.872, \quad \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732, \quad \sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3} \approx 2.140,
\]
\[
\cos\theta = \frac{2.140}{6} \approx 0.3567.
\]
Thus:
\[
\theta = \arccos(0.3567) \approx 69^\circ.
\]

The angle between the two photons is:
\[
\phi = 2\theta \approx 2 \times 69^\circ = 138^\circ.
\]

### Final Answer:
The angle between the directions of the photons is **138 degrees**.
