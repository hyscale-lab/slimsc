Okay, I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. So, the state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as vectors in a Hilbert space, which should be normalized. Hmm, does this vector need to be normalized first? Let me check.

The vector is [-1, 2, 1]^T. The norm squared would be (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So I think the state should be normalized. So the actual state vector is (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T.

Now the problem is about measuring P and then Q. The question is, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in their respective measurements.

Wait, the order is important. First measure P, then measure Q. But wait, actually, when you measure an observable, the system collapses into an eigenstate of that observable. So the first measurement of P would collapse the state into an eigenstate of P, and then measuring Q would be done on that new state.

But wait, the problem asks for the probability of getting 0 in P and -1 in Q. So the process is: first, measure P and get 0, then measure Q and get -1. So I need to find the probability of that sequence of events.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the joint probability of measuring 0 for P and -1 for Q in two successive measurements. But I think the way measurements work is that the second measurement is on the state after the first measurement. So the process is: first measurement of P, which collapses the state into an eigenstate of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Then, on that state, measure Q and get -1.

Alternatively, perhaps the state after P's measurement is a superposition of eigenstates of P, but in reality, if you measure P and get a particular outcome, the state collapses into that eigenstate.

Wait, but in this case, the first measurement is of P, so the system will collapse into an eigenstate of P. So the eigenvalues of P are important. Let me find the eigenvalues of P.

The matrix P is:

Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Row 2:1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)

Row 3:0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Wait, I think to find the eigenvalues, I need to compute the determinant of (P - λ I). So let's set that up.

The matrix P - λ I is:

-λ    1/√2    0

1/√2  -λ     1/√2

0     1/√2   -λ

Now, the determinant of this matrix is:

| -λ    1/√2    0  |

|1/√2  -λ    1/√2 |

| 0    1/√2   -λ |

Calculating this determinant: Hmm, perhaps expanding along the first row.

So the determinant is:

-λ * det( [ [-λ, 1/√2], [1/√2, -λ] ]) - (1/√2) * det( [ [1/√2, 1/√2], [0, -λ] ]) + 0 * det(...)

The first term: -λ [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] = -λ [ λ^2 - (1/2) ]

The second term: -(1/√2) [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ] = -(1/√2)( -λ/(√2) ) = (λ)/(2)

So the determinant is:

-λ (λ² - 1/2) + λ/2

= -λ³ + (λ)/2 + λ/2

= -λ³ + λ

So setting determinant to zero:

-λ³ + λ = 0 → λ ( -λ² + 1 ) =0 → λ(1 - λ²) )=0 → λ=0, λ=1, λ=-1.

So the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, -1.

Therefore, when measuring P, possible outcomes are 0, 1, -1.

We are interested in the case where the first measurement is 0 for P.

So the first step is to find the eigenvector of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

Let me find the eigenvectors for P with eigenvalue 0.

We solve (P - 0 I) v =0 → P v=0.

So the matrix P is:

Row 1: 0, 1/√2, 0

Row 2:1/√2, 0, 1/√2

Row 3:0, 1/√2, 0

So the equations are:

0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → (1/√2) v2 =0 → v2=0.

Second equation: (1/√2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2) v3 =0 → (v1 + v3)/√2 =0 → v1 + v3 =0 → v3 = -v1.

Third equation: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 +0*v3 =0 → again v2=0.

So from first equation, v2=0. From third equation, same.

So eigenvector for λ=0 is any scalar multiple of [1, 0, -1]^T.

So the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by (1, 0, -1)^T.

Wait, but vectors are usually normalized. So the eigenvector can be written as (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1]^T, but actually wait, normalization factor is 1 over sqrt(1² + (-1)^2) )=1/sqrt(2). So normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1]^T.

So when the system is measured in P and the outcome is 0, the state collapses to this normalized eigenvector.

So the state after measuring P=0 is |ψ_p> = [1; 0; -1]/sqrt(2).

Now, we need to measure Q. The operator Q is a diagonal matrix with elements (1, 0, -1) on the diagonal. So its matrix is:

[1, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, -1]

So the eigenvalues of Q are 1, 0, -1.

The eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. Because Q is diagonal, each basis vector is an eigenvector.

So the eigenstates are |1> = [1; 0; 0], |0> = [0;1;0], and |-1> = [0;0;1]. But wait, the eigenvalue 0 has a one-dimensional eigenspace, spanned by [0;1;0].

Wait, but the state after the first measurement is |ψ_p> = [1; 0; -1]/sqrt(2). So to find the probability of measuring Q=-1, we need to compute the projection of |ψ_p> onto the |-1> eigenstate of Q.

Because the eigenstates of Q are |1>, |0>, and |-1>, the probability to get -1 is the square of the amplitude of |-1> in |ψ_p>.

So let's compute the inner product of |ψ_p> and |-1>.

|ψ_p> is [1, 0, -1]/sqrt(2)

|-1> is [0, 0, 1]

The inner product is (1/sqrt(2))*0 + (0)*0 + (-1/sqrt(2))*1 = -1/sqrt(2).

The amplitude is -1/sqrt(2), the probability is the square of the absolute value, which is (1/2).

Wait, but wait. Because the state after P=0 is |ψ_p> = [1,0,-1]/sqrt(2).

The state for Q=-1 is |q> = [0,0,1]. So the inner product is <q|ψ_p> = (0)(1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (1)(-1/sqrt(2)) )= -1/sqrt(2). The square of the magnitude is (1/2), so probability is 1/2.

But wait, wait a second. The state after P=0 is |ψ_p> = [1,0,-1]/sqrt(2). So when we measure Q, what are the possible outcomes? The eigenvalues are 1,0,-1.

So the probabilities are:

For Q=1: inner product of |1> and |ψ_p> is [1,0,0] · [1,0,-1]/sqrt(2) → 1/sqrt(2). Probability (1/sqrt(2))²=1/2.

For Q=0: inner product with [0,1,0] is 0. So probability 0.

For Q=-1: as computed, also 1/2.

Wait, but that can't be right because 1/2 + 0 + 1/2 =1, so that's correct. So the probability of getting Q=-1 is 1/2.

But wait, the problem asks for the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

So the first step is measuring P=0, which has a certain probability, and then given that, measuring Q=-1, which has probability 1/2.

So the overall probability is the product of the probabilities of each step.

Wait, no. The first measurement is P, and the probability of getting 0 is the square of the amplitude of the state in the eigenvector of P corresponding to 0.

So let me compute that.

The initial state is |ψ> = [ -1, 2, 1 ] / sqrt(6).

The eigenvector for P=0 is |p0> = [1, 0, -1]/sqrt(2).

So the inner product <p0 | ψ> is [1,0,-1]/sqrt(2) · [ -1, 2, 1 ] / sqrt(6) = [ (1)(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1)(1) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) = (-1 + 0 -1 ) / sqrt(12) )= (-2)/ (2*sqrt(3)) )= -1/sqrt(3).

The amplitude is -1/sqrt(3), so the probability of getting P=0 is (1/sqrt(3))² = 1/3.

So the first part is 1/3, and then the probability of getting Q=-1 given that P=0 is 1/2 (from earlier calculation).

So the total probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

Wait, but wait. Let me recheck the inner product calculation.

|p0> = [1, 0, -1]/sqrt(2), |ψ> = [ -1, 2, 1 ] / sqrt(6).

Dot product: (1)(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)(1) = (-1 -1) = -2.

Divide by (sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) = sqrt(12) = 2*sqrt(3).

So -2/(2 sqrt(3)) )= -1/sqrt(3).

So amplitude is -1/sqrt(3), magnitude squared 1/3.

So the probability of P=0 is 1/3.

Then, after getting P=0, the state is |p0>, and the probability of Q=-1 is 1/2.

So overall probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

Looking at the options, option D is 1/6.

So the answer should be D.

To solve the problem, we analyze the sequence of measurements and the probabilities involved.

### Step 1: Normalize the initial state
The initial state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The norm of this vector is:

\[
\|\psi\| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \(P\)
The operator \(P\) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

To find the eigenvalues, we solve \(\det(P - \lambda I) = 0\). The eigenvalues are found to be \(0, 1, -1\). For the eigenvalue \(0\), the corresponding eigenvector satisfies \(Pv = 0\). Solving the equations, the eigenvector is:

\[
v = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Normalizing this eigenvector, we get:

\[
|p_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: Probability of measuring \(P = 0\)
The probability of measuring \(P = 0\) is the square of the amplitude of the initial state \(|\psi\rangle\) in the eigenvector \(|p_0\rangle\). The inner product is:

\[
\langle p_0 | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

\[
\langle p_0 | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{6}} \left( (1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) \right) = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
P(P=0) = |\langle p_0 | \psi \rangle|^2 = \left(\frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Step 4: State after measuring \(P = 0\)
If the measurement of \(P\) yields \(0\), the system collapses to the state \(|p_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}\).

### Step 5: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \(Q\)
The operator \(Q\) is represented by the diagonal matrix:

\[
Q = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \(Q\) are \(1, 0, -1\), and the corresponding eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors:

\[
|q_1\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad |q_0\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad |q_{-1}\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 6: Probability of measuring \(Q = -1\) after \(P = 0\)
The probability of measuring \(Q = -1\) is the square of the amplitude of \(|p_0\rangle\) in \(|q_{-1}\rangle\). The inner product is:

\[
\langle q_{-1} | p_0 \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
P(Q=-1 | P=0) = |\langle q_{-1} | p_0 \rangle|^2 = \left(\frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 7: Total probability
The total probability of measuring \(P = 0\) and \(Q = -1\) is the product of the probabilities:

\[
P(P=0 \text{ and } Q=-1) = P(P=0) \cdot P(Q=-1 | P=0) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probability of measuring \(P = 0\) and \(Q = -1\) is:
