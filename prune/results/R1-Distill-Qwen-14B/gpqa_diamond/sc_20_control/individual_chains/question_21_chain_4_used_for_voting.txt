Okay, so I've got this chemistry question to tackle, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. It gives two parts, A and B, and asks which compounds fit certain properties. The options are combinations of which compound doesn't show tautomerism (A) and which shows optical isomerism (B).

First, I need to understand what each part is asking.

Part A: Which compound does not show tautomerism? The two compounds given are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. I remember that tautomerism involves the relocation of a hydrogen atom and the shift of a double bond. For example, in keto-enol tautomerism, a compound can switch between a keto form and an enol form. But wait, I need to think about whether these compounds can undergo such tautomerism.

Benzoquinone: Benzoquinone is C6H4O2, right? It has two ketone groups (since it's a quinone). Wait, benzoquinone can be either para or ortho. Para-benzoquinone has two ketone groups opposite each other. Now, can benzoquinone undergo tautomerism? Well, tautomerism typically occurs when there's a conjugated system that allows for the movement of a hydrogen and a shift in double bonds. Benzoquinone has conjugated double bonds. So, maybe it can tautomerize. Alternatively, maybe not because the structure is more stable. Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone doesn't easily tautomerize because it's a quinone with two carbonyl groups, but I'm not so sure. Let me think: tautomerism in quinones? I'm not remembering clearly. Maybe not because the structure is more rigid? Alternatively, perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is the one that can't.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: This compound has three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5 on a cyclohexane ring. So it's O=C-(cyclohexane)-C=O at those positions. Now, can this compound undergo tautomerism? For that, it would need conjugated double bonds. Wait, cyclohexane is a six-membered ring, so 1,3,5-trione would have alternating double bonds? No, wait, each ketone is a single group, but the ring itself might have alternating single and double bonds. Wait, no, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a flat structure with alternating double bonds between the carbonyls, making it a conjugated system. So, in that case, maybe it can't undergo tautomerism. Because tautomerism requires a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group that can shift, but if the structure is fully conjugated, perhaps there's no such hydrogen available. Wait, but the rings are usually in a chair conformation, but maybe in a planar form. Alternatively, perhaps the positions are too rigid for tautomerism. Hmm.

Wait, maybe benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism because the structure is already conjugated and stable. Or maybe it does, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I'm getting a bit stuck here, so I'll move on to part B and see if maybe that'll help.

Part B: Which of the two compounds, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate, will show optical isomerism. Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center, meaning it has four different groups attached to a carbon atom.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: Let's break down the structure. The formula is CH2(COOH)CH2OCH3? Wait, no. Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH, so the ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Therefore, the structure is O
       |
CH3-C-O-C-OCH3
But wait, the actual structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester where the hydroxy group is on the second carbon. So, it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait. The structure of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. When esterified with methanol, the -OH on the OH group is replaced by OMe. Wait, no. Esterification replaces the -OH of the carboxylic acid. Wait, no, the structure is: the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the central carbon (the second carbon) has the groups: CH2(OH), CH2COOCH3, and two other groups? Wait, no. Let me draw it:

The molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (second carbon) is attached to:

- CH3 (from the first carbon)
- OH
- COOCH3 (the ester group)
- and another H? Wait, wait, no. Wait, perhaps it's better to write the structure: the 2-hydroxypropanoate ester. The structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? No, wait. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So when esterified, it becomes CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH(OH)-CH3 ?

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me count the carbons. Propanoate is 3 carbons: COO- attached to a two-carbon chain. So 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon of the propanoate.

So structure is O
          |
CH3-C-O-C-OCH3
But wait, that's not correct. Let me get this right. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon, so structure is CH2(OH)CH2COO-.

So the ester is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

So the second carbon (the one with OH) is attached to:

- CH2(OH) (the first carbon)
- CH2COOCH3 (the third carbon)
- an OH group
- and a hydrogen.

Wait, no, wait. Let's think about the structure of 2-hydroxypropanoate methyl ester: it's CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Another way: the formula is C3H6O3 (maybe? Let me check: propanoic acid is C3H6O2. 2-hydroxy adds an OH, so becomes C3H8O3. Then esterified with methanol: the -OH on the COOH is replaced by OCH3, so the formula becomes C4H8O3.

But for the actual structure, the molecule is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the central carbon (the second carbon) is connected to:

- a CH3 (from the first carbon)
- an OH group
- a COOCH3 group (from the third carbon)
- and a hydrogen.

Wait, so that's four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. That would make it a chiral center. So this compound should have optical isomers, meaning it can exhibit optical isomerism.

Now, the other compound is dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the di-ester of maleic acid. Maleic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. No, wait, maleic acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. When both -OH groups are esterified with methanol, we get (CH3O)OC-CH=CH-COOCH3. So dimethyl fumarate is the di-ester: structure is O
                     || 
CH2CH2
       O
       ||
CH3O-C-CH2-C-OCH3
Wait, no, more accurately, it's CH3O-C(=O)-CH2CH2-C(=O)-OCH3? No, wait. Maleic acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, when both COOH groups are esterified with methanol, each becomes COOCH3. So dimethyl fumarate is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3.

Wait, no, actually, fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate. So, the structure is CH3OOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, no, wait, fumarate is the trans-diesters, so it's CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. So the double bond is between the two CH groups, in trans configuration.

Now, does dimethyl fumarate have any chiral centers? Let's look. The central part is CH=CH. Each of those carbons is attached to two oxygens from the ester groups. So, each CH in the double bond is connected to two OCOOCH3 groups. Wait, each CH in the double bond is attached to an OCOOCH3 on each side. So, the structure is O
           || 
CH2-CH2
       O
       ||
But that's not correct. Wait, no, it's CH3OOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3 for the cis isomer (which is maleate), but fumarate is the trans. So, the structure for dimethyl fumarate is CH3OOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, the double bond is in the middle. So in fumarate, the structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. So, each CH in the double bond is attached to an OCOOCH3 group and a CH3OOC group? Wait, no. Let me clarify:

Each of the two CH groups in the double bond is attached to an ester group. So, for each of the two carbons in the double bond, the substituents are:

- One COOCH3 group on each carbon.
- The other substituent is a CH3OOC group on one carbon and another CH3OOC on the other? No, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the two carbons in the double bond each have an OCOOCH3 group attached. Wait, perhaps it's better to think about each CH in the double bond being attached to a COOCH3 group and another COOCH3 group? No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps each carbon in the double bond has two ester groups. So, for dimethyl fumarate, the structure is O
                     ||
CH2C(=O)OCH3
       ||
CH2C(=O)OCH3 

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps each of the two central carbons in the double bond is connected to an ester group on each side. So each CH has two ester groups. Wait, but then each CH would have two OCOOCH3 groups attached, making them have four substituents: two ester groups and two CH groups. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps each of the carbons in the double bond is connected to an ester group on each side. So, each carbon has two ester groups, which would actually make them each have four substituents, but probably leading to a planar structure.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps it's easier to think about the possibility of each molecule having a chiral center.

In dimethyl fumarate, are there any chiral centers? The central carbons are part of a double bond, so they can't be chiral centers because they don't have four different substituents. Each has two substituents: the ester groups on either side, and the double bond. So, no, there's no chiral center in dimethyl fumarate. Thus, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait a second. Fumarate is the trans isomer. So, the structure is O
           || 
CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3.

Each CH in the double bond is attached to two ester groups (OOCCH3), and each has a double bond to the other CH. So, each CH in the double bond has two identical groups attached (the OOCCH3 groups), so they can't be chiral centers because they would have two identical substituents. So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, hence no optical isomerism.

But wait, what about the other compound, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Earlier, I thought that the second carbon (the one with the OH) is attached to four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. So, that would make it a chiral center, hence the compound would have optical isomers. So, part B is asking which one shows optical isomerism, so the answer would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check that. Let me write down the structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

It's CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (CH(OH) group) is attached to:

1. CH3 (the first carbon)
2. OH (the hydroxyl group)
3. COOCH3 (the ester group at the third carbon)
4. and a hydrogen.

So, four different substituents. Therefore, it's a chiral center, making the compound capable of optical isomerism.

So back to part B: between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (which has a chiral center) and dimethyl fumarate (which doesn't), the correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism. So B would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, but the options for part B are between these two. So part B's answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, but let's go back to part A. Which compound doesn't show tautomerism.

Benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

I think I need to figure out which of these two cannot undergo tautomerism.

Tautomerism typically requires that a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group can shift, leading to a change in the position of the double bond.

Benzoquinone: it's a benzene ring with two ketone groups. Let me think about para-benzoquinone, which is O=C6H4=O (but in reality, it's more like two ketone groups in para positions on benzene). So, the structure is O=C-C6H4-C=O (with the benzene ring between the two carbonyls).

So, can benzoquinone undergo tautomerism? I'm not sure. I think that tautomerism in quinones is a possibility. For example, quinones can exist in keto and enol forms. Wait, but benzoquinone would have two carbonyl groups, making it difficult for a hydrogen to shift because the adjacent positions are already double-bonded. Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone doesn't have any hydrogens in positions where tautomerism is possible. Let me think: the structure of para-benzoquinone is O=C-C6H4-C=O. The benzene ring has two carbonyl groups opposite each other. So, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyls are part of the ring. Those carbons have hydrogens attached. So, maybe those hydrogens can shift, leading to a different arrangement.

Alternatively, maybe the positions are rigid, making tautomerism difficult. Or perhaps benzoquinone does show some tautomerism, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three carbonyl groups. So, the structure is O=C-C-C-O-C-C-O, but in a six-membered ring. So, the ring is fully conjugated, with alternating double bonds. So, in this case, each carbonyl is flanked by double bonds. Hence, maybe there are no hydrogens adjacent to the carbonyl groups that can shift, which would make tautomerism impossible.

Wait, but in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each of the ketone groups is at positions 1,3,5. So, the ring would have double bonds between 1-2, 3-4, and 5-6, perhaps. So, each ketone is at a carbon that's connected via double bonds to the next and previous carbons. So, the carbons adjacent to the ketones are double-bonded, which means the carbons next to the carbonyl have no hydrogens (since they are double-bonded to the carbonyl). Therefore, in such a structure, there's no hydrogen attached to a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group that can shift, because those adjacent carbons are part of double bonds and have no hydrogens. Hence, tautomerism is not possible.

So, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione cannot undergo tautomerism, while benzoquinone can.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me think again. Benzoquinone has the structure O=C-C6H4-C=O. In this structure, each of the carbonyl carbons is attached to a benzene ring. The adjacent carbons (the ones in the ring) have hydrogens attached. So, perhaps those hydrogens can shift, leading to a change in the position of the double bonds. For example, a hydrogen on the benzene ring adjacent to a carbonyl could shift, converting a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl into a single bond and vice versa.

Wait, but in the benzene ring, the carbons are part of a conjugated system. If a hydrogen shifts, it would affect the conjugation. But perhaps benzoquinone can exist in two tautomeric forms, keto and enol. Alternatively, maybe it can't because the structure is too rigid.

Alternatively, perhaps benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism because the adjacent positions are already part of the aromatic ring, which doesn't allow for the necessary shift. But I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, I found some information in my notes: Quinones can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. For example, para-benzoquinone can tautomerize to form a dihydroxybenzaldehyde structure, but wait, that might require breaking the aromaticity. Alternatively, perhaps the tautomerism is not possible because the structure is too stable, or because the necessary hydrogen isn't present.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's look for another angle.

So, the question is which compound does not show tautomerism. If cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione cannot undergo tautomerism because it lacks adjacent hydrogens, then it's the one that doesn't show tautomerism. Benzoquinone, on the other hand, can. So, A would be cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Wait, but earlier I thought that in benzoquinone, the adjacent carbons are part of the benzene ring, which may not allow for tautomerism.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for examples. For instance, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is also known as hexahydro-1,3,5-triazacyclohexane? No, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different structure.

Alternatively, I found that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a cyclic triketone. In such a structure, the ring is fully conjugated with double bonds, so each of the carbonyls is flanked by double bonds, making it impossible for any hydrogen to shift, because the adjacent carbons are double-bonded and have no hydrogens. So, no tautomerism is possible.

Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't show tautomerism, while benzoquinone, which has adjacent hydrogens, does. So, part A's answer is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Wait, but earlier I thought that benzoquinone can't undergo tautomerism because the adjacent hydrogens are part of the aromatic ring, but perhaps that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone can undergo tautomerism, making cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione the one that doesn't.

So, for part A, the correct choice is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione as the compound that doesn't show tautomerism.

Now, putting it together.

Part A: A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Part B: The compound that shows optical isomerism is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Looking at the options:

Option A: A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Option B: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Option C: A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate.

Option D: A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate.

So the correct combination is A's choice (cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) and B's choice (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate). So option A is correct.

Wait, option A says: A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. That matches our conclusion.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the correct answer, we analyze the two parts of the question:

### Part A: Which compound does not show tautomerism?
Tautomerism requires the presence of a hydrogen atom adjacent to a carbonyl group that can shift, altering the position of the double bond. 

1. **Benzoquinone**: Benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups in para positions. The adjacent carbons in the benzene ring are part of the aromatic system, which makes tautomerism unlikely due to the rigidity of the structure. However, benzoquinone can exist in keto-enol forms, indicating that it does undergo tautomerism.

2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The ring is fully conjugated with alternating double bonds, and the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of these double bonds. As a result, there are no hydrogens on these carbons that can shift, making tautomerism impossible.

Thus, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione** does not show tautomerism, while benzoquinone does.

---

### Part B: Which compound shows optical isomerism?
Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center, i.e., a carbon atom attached to four different groups.

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure of this compound is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The second carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:
   - CH3 (methyl group),
   - OH (hydroxyl group),
   - COOCH3 (ester group),
   - and a hydrogen atom.
   Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center, and the compound exhibits optical isomerism.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure of dimethyl fumarate is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. The two carbons in the double bond are each attached to two identical groups (COOCH3), and the double bond prevents these carbons from being chiral centers. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not exhibit optical isomerism.

Thus, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** shows optical isomerism, while dimethyl fumarate does not.

---

### Final Answer:
From the analysis:
- Part A: **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione** does not show tautomerism.
- Part B: **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** shows optical isomerism.

The correct option is **A: A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

ANSWER: A

Okay, so I've got this chemistry question to tackle, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. It gives two parts, A and B, and asks which compounds fit certain properties. The options are combinations of which compound doesn't show tautomerism (A) and which shows optical isomerism (B).

First, I need to understand what each part is asking.

Part A: Which compound does not show tautomerism? The two compounds given are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. I remember that tautomerism involves the relocation of a hydrogen atom and the shift of a double bond. For example, in keto-enol tautomerism, a compound can switch between a keto form and an enol form. But wait, I need to think about whether these compounds can undergo such tautomerism.

Benzoquinone: Benzoquinone is C6H4O2, right? It has two ketone groups (since it's a quinone). Wait, benzoquinone can be either para or ortho. Para-benzoquinone has two ketone groups opposite each other. Now, can benzoquinone undergo tautomerism? Well, tautomerism typically occurs when there's a conjugated system that allows for the movement of a hydrogen and a shift in double bonds. Benzoquinone has conjugated double bonds. So, maybe it can tautomerize. Alternatively, maybe not because the structure is more stable. Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone doesn't easily tautomerize because it's a quinone with two carbonyl groups, but I'm not so sure. Let me think: tautomerism in quinones? I'm not remembering clearly. Maybe not because the structure is more rigid? Alternatively, perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is the one that can't.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: This compound has three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5 on a cyclohexane ring. So it's O=C-(cyclohexane)-C=O at those positions. Now, can this compound undergo tautomerism? For that, it would need conjugated double bonds. Wait, cyclohexane is a six-membered ring, so 1,3,5-trione would have alternating double bonds? No, wait, each ketone is a single group, but the ring itself might have alternating single and double bonds. Wait, no, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a flat structure with alternating double bonds between the carbonyls, making it a conjugated system. So, in that case, maybe it can't undergo tautomerism. Because tautomerism requires a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group that can shift, but if the structure is fully conjugated, perhaps there's no such hydrogen available. Wait, but the rings are usually in a chair conformation, but maybe in a planar form. Alternatively, perhaps the positions are too rigid for tautomerism. Hmm.

Wait, maybe benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism because the structure is already conjugated and stable. Or maybe it does, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I'm getting a bit stuck here, so I'll move on to part B and see if maybe that'll help.

Part B: Which of the two compounds, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate, will show optical isomerism. Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center, meaning it has four different groups attached to a carbon atom.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: Let's break down the structure. The formula is CH2(COOH)CH2OCH3? Wait, no. Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH, so the ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Therefore, the structure is O
       |
CH3-C-O-C-OCH3
But wait, the actual structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester where the hydroxy group is on the second carbon. So, it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait. The structure of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. When esterified with methanol, the -OH on the OH group is replaced by OMe. Wait, no. Esterification replaces the -OH of the carboxylic acid. Wait, no, the structure is: the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the central carbon (the second carbon) has the groups: CH2(OH), CH2COOCH3, and two other groups? Wait, no. Let me draw it:

The molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (second carbon) is attached to:

- CH3 (from the first carbon)
- OH
- COOCH3 (the ester group)
- and another H? Wait, wait, no. Wait, perhaps it's better to write the structure: the 2-hydroxypropanoate ester. The structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? No, wait. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So when esterified, it becomes CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH(OH)-CH3 ?

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me count the carbons. Propanoate is 3 carbons: COO- attached to a two-carbon chain. So 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon of the propanoate.

So structure is O
          |
CH3-C-O-C-OCH3
But wait, that's not correct. Let me get this right. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon, so structure is CH2(OH)CH2COO-.

So the ester is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

So the second carbon (the one with OH) is attached to:

- CH2(OH) (the first carbon)
- CH2COOCH3 (the third carbon)
- an OH group
- and a hydrogen.

Wait, no, wait. Let's think about the structure of 2-hydroxypropanoate methyl ester: it's CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Another way: the formula is C3H6O3 (maybe? Let me check: propanoic acid is C3H6O2. 2-hydroxy adds an OH, so becomes C3H8O3. Then esterified with methanol: the -OH on the COOH is replaced by OCH3, so the formula becomes C4H8O3.

But for the actual structure, the molecule is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the central carbon (the second carbon) is connected to:

- a CH3 (from the first carbon)
- an OH group
- a COOCH3 group (from the third carbon)
- and a hydrogen.

Wait, so that's four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. That would make it a chiral center. So this compound should have optical isomers, meaning it can exhibit optical isomerism.

Now, the other compound is dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the di-ester of maleic acid. Maleic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. No, wait, maleic acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. When both -OH groups are esterified with methanol, we get (CH3O)OC-CH=CH-COOCH3. So dimethyl fumarate is the di-ester: structure is O
                     || 
CH2CH2
       O
       ||
CH3O-C-CH2-C-OCH3
Wait, no, more accurately, it's CH3O-C(=O)-CH2CH2-C(=O)-OCH3? No, wait. Maleic acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, when both COOH groups are esterified with methanol, each becomes COOCH3. So dimethyl fumarate is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3.

Wait, no, actually, fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate. So, the structure is CH3OOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, no, wait, fumarate is the trans-diesters, so it's CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. So the double bond is between the two CH groups, in trans configuration.

Now, does dimethyl fumarate have any chiral centers? Let's look. The central part is CH=CH. Each of those carbons is attached to two oxygens from the ester groups. So, each CH in the double bond is connected to two OCOOCH3 groups. Wait, each CH in the double bond is attached to an OCOOCH3 on each side. So, the structure is O
           || 
CH2-CH2
       O
       ||
But that's not correct. Wait, no, it's CH3OOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3 for the cis isomer (which is maleate), but fumarate is the trans. So, the structure for dimethyl fumarate is CH3OOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, the double bond is in the middle. So in fumarate, the structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. So, each CH in the double bond is attached to an OCOOCH3 group and a CH3OOC group? Wait, no. Let me clarify:

Each of the two CH groups in the double bond is attached to an ester group. So, for each of the two carbons in the double bond, the substituents are:

- One COOCH3 group on each carbon.
- The other substituent is a CH3OOC group on one carbon and another CH3OOC on the other? No, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the two carbons in the double bond each have an OCOOCH3 group attached. Wait, perhaps it's better to think about each CH in the double bond being attached to a COOCH3 group and another COOCH3 group? No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps each carbon in the double bond has two ester groups. So, for dimethyl fumarate, the structure is O
                     ||
CH2C(=O)OCH3
       ||
CH2C(=O)OCH3 

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps each of the two central carbons in the double bond is connected to an ester group on each side. So each CH has two ester groups. Wait, but then each CH would have two OCOOCH3 groups attached, making them have four substituents: two ester groups and two CH groups. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps each of the carbons in the double bond is connected to an ester group on each side. So, each carbon has two ester groups, which would actually make them each have four substituents, but probably leading to a planar structure.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps it's easier to think about the possibility of each molecule having a chiral center.

In dimethyl fumarate, are there any chiral centers? The central carbons are part of a double bond, so they can't be chiral centers because they don't have four different substituents. Each has two substituents: the ester groups on either side, and the double bond. So, no, there's no chiral center in dimethyl fumarate. Thus, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait a second. Fumarate is the trans isomer. So, the structure is O
           || 
CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3.

Each CH in the double bond is attached to two ester groups (OOCCH3), and each has a double bond to the other CH. So, each CH in the double bond has two identical groups attached (the OOCCH3 groups), so they can't be chiral centers because they would have two identical substituents. So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, hence no optical isomerism.

But wait, what about the other compound, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Earlier, I thought that the second carbon (the one with the OH) is attached to four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. So, that would make it a chiral center, hence the compound would have optical isomers. So, part B is asking which one shows optical isomerism, so the answer would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check that. Let me write down the structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

It's CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (CH(OH) group) is attached to:

1. CH3 (the first carbon)
2. OH (the hydroxyl group)
3. COOCH3 (the ester group at the third carbon)
4. and a hydrogen.

So, four different substituents. Therefore, it's a chiral center, making the compound capable of optical isomerism.

So back to part B: between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (which has a chiral center) and dimethyl fumarate (which doesn't), the correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism. So B would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, but the options for part B are between these two. So part B's answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, but let's go back to part A. Which compound doesn't show tautomerism.

Benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

I think I need to figure out which of these two cannot undergo tautomerism.

Tautomerism typically requires that a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group can shift, leading to a change in the position of the double bond.

Benzoquinone: it's a benzene ring with two ketone groups. Let me think about para-benzoquinone, which is O=C6H4=O (but in reality, it's more like two ketone groups in para positions on benzene). So, the structure is O=C-C6H4-C=O (with the benzene ring between the two carbonyls).

So, can benzoquinone undergo tautomerism? I'm not sure. I think that tautomerism in quinones is a possibility. For example, quinones can exist in keto and enol forms. Wait, but benzoquinone would have two carbonyl groups, making it difficult for a hydrogen to shift because the adjacent positions are already double-bonded. Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone doesn't have any hydrogens in positions where tautomerism is possible. Let me think: the structure of para-benzoquinone is O=C-C6H4-C=O. The benzene ring has two carbonyl groups opposite each other. So, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyls are part of the ring. Those carbons have hydrogens attached. So, maybe those hydrogens can shift, leading to a different arrangement.

Alternatively, maybe the positions are rigid, making tautomerism difficult. Or perhaps benzoquinone does show some tautomerism, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three carbonyl groups. So, the structure is O=C-C-C-O-C-C-O, but in a six-membered ring. So, the ring is fully conjugated, with alternating double bonds. So, in this case, each carbonyl is flanked by double bonds. Hence, maybe there are no hydrogens adjacent to the carbonyl groups that can shift, which would make tautomerism impossible.

Wait, but in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each of the ketone groups is at positions 1,3,5. So, the ring would have double bonds between 1-2, 3-4, and 5-6, perhaps. So, each ketone is at a carbon that's connected via double bonds to the next and previous carbons. So, the carbons adjacent to the ketones are double-bonded, which means the carbons next to the carbonyl have no hydrogens (since they are double-bonded to the carbonyl). Therefore, in such a structure, there's no hydrogen attached to a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group that can shift, because those adjacent carbons are part of double bonds and have no hydrogens. Hence, tautomerism is not possible.

So, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione cannot undergo tautomerism, while benzoquinone can.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me think again. Benzoquinone has the structure O=C-C6H4-C=O. In this structure, each of the carbonyl carbons is attached to a benzene ring. The adjacent carbons (the ones in the ring) have hydrogens attached. So, perhaps those hydrogens can shift, leading to a change in the position of the double bonds. For example, a hydrogen on the benzene ring adjacent to a carbonyl could shift, converting a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl into a single bond and vice versa.

Wait, but in the benzene ring, the carbons are part of a conjugated system. If a hydrogen shifts, it would affect the conjugation. But perhaps benzoquinone can exist in two tautomeric forms, keto and enol. Alternatively, maybe it can't because the structure is too rigid.

Alternatively, perhaps benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism because the adjacent positions are already part of the aromatic ring, which doesn't allow for the necessary shift. But I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, I found some information in my notes: Quinones can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. For example, para-benzoquinone can tautomerize to form a dihydroxybenzaldehyde structure, but wait, that might require breaking the aromaticity. Alternatively, perhaps the tautomerism is not possible because the structure is too stable, or because the necessary hydrogen isn't present.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's look for another angle.

So, the question is which compound does not show tautomerism. If cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione cannot undergo tautomerism because it lacks adjacent hydrogens, then it's the one that doesn't show tautomerism. Benzoquinone, on the other hand, can. So, A would be cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Wait, but earlier I thought that in benzoquinone, the adjacent carbons are part of the benzene ring, which may not allow for tautomerism.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for examples. For instance, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is also known as hexahydro-1,3,5-triazacyclohexane? No, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different structure.

Alternatively, I found that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a cyclic triketone. In such a structure, the ring is fully conjugated with double bonds, so each of the carbonyls is flanked by double bonds, making it impossible for any hydrogen to shift, because the adjacent carbons are double-bonded and have no hydrogens. So, no tautomerism is possible.

Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't show tautomerism, while benzoquinone, which has adjacent hydrogens, does. So, part A's answer is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Wait, but earlier I thought that benzoquinone can't undergo tautomerism because the adjacent hydrogens are part of the aromatic ring, but perhaps that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone can undergo tautomerism, making cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione the one that doesn't.

So, for part A, the correct choice is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione as the compound that doesn't show tautomerism.

Now, putting it together.

Part A: A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Part B: The compound that shows optical isomerism is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Looking at the options:

Option A: A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Option B: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Option C: A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate.

Option D: A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate.

So the correct combination is A's choice (cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) and B's choice (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate). So option A is correct.

Wait, option A says: A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. That matches our conclusion.


To determine the correct answer, we analyze the two parts of the question:

### Part A: Which compound does not show tautomerism?
Tautomerism requires the presence of a hydrogen atom adjacent to a carbonyl group that can shift, altering the position of the double bond. 

1. **Benzoquinone**: Benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups in para positions. The adjacent carbons in the benzene ring are part of the aromatic system, which makes tautomerism unlikely due to the rigidity of the structure. However, benzoquinone can exist in keto-enol forms, indicating that it does undergo tautomerism.

2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The ring is fully conjugated with alternating double bonds, and the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of these double bonds. As a result, there are no hydrogens on these carbons that can shift, making tautomerism impossible.

Thus, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione** does not show tautomerism, while benzoquinone does.

### Part B: Which compound shows optical isomerism?
Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center, i.e., a carbon atom attached to four different groups.

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure of this compound is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The second carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:
   - CH3 (methyl group),
   - OH (hydroxyl group),
   - COOCH3 (ester group),
   - and a hydrogen atom.
   Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center, and the compound exhibits optical isomerism.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure of dimethyl fumarate is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. The two carbons in the double bond are each attached to two identical groups (COOCH3), and the double bond prevents these carbons from being chiral centers. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not exhibit optical isomerism.

Thus, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** shows optical isomerism, while dimethyl fumarate does not.

---

### Final Answer:
From the analysis:
- Part A: **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione** does not show tautomerism.
- Part B: **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** shows optical isomerism.

The correct option is **A: A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.
