Okay, so I have this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says there are two planets orbiting a star. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 times the sun's, and an effective temperature of 6300 K. Planet1 is 7 Earth masses with radius 1.7 Earths, and Planet2 is 5 Earth masses with radius 1.3 Earths. Both orbits are circular. The question is about their equilibrium temperatures.

Wait, equilibrium temperature. Right, that's the temperature a planet would have if it's in thermal equilibrium, considering the energy it absorbs and emits. The formula I remember is something like T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.25. Oh wait, albedo is the same for both planets, so that factor cancels out in the ratio.

So the star's Teff is 6300 K. But wait, in the formula, the star's temperature part is (Teff)^4, right? Because the flux goes as T^4 (Stefan-Boltzmann law). Oh, but in this case, the star's Teff is given, so maybe I can model the star's luminosity.

Wait, the star's luminosity is proportional to R^2 * Teff^4. So L = 4πR²σTeff^4. But for the equilibrium temperature, the planet's distance from the star (a) matters.

Wait, the equilibrium temperature formula for a planet is T_planet = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * sqrt( (1 - albedo) )^0.25. Wait, no, let me think again. The formula I remember is T_p = T_* * sqrt(R_* / (2a)) ) * ( ( (1 - A) )^(1/4) ), where A is the albedo.

Wait, but in this case, the albedos are the same for both planets, so the (1 - A) factor would be the same, so when taking the ratio, it would cancel. So the ratio T1/T2 would depend on the sqrt(R_* / (2a1)) divided by sqrt(R_* / (2a2)) ), which simplifies to sqrt(a2/a1). So T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1). Hmm, that's if the star's Teff is the same, which it is here since it's the same star.

But wait, how do I find the semi-major axes, a, for each planet? Because the RV method gives the mass and the period. Oh wait, the question mentions that the RV method detected the planets. The RV shift gives the mass of the planet and the period (if you have the star's mass). Oh wait, the RV method gives the velocity semi-amplitude, which depends on the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the distance (a). But since both planets are orbiting the same star, their periods can be determined, but the question doesn't give periods. Hmm.

Wait, the question gives the RV shifts for each planet. Oh wait, the RV shift is related to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The RV shift (K) is given by K = (v * sin i) where v is the star's velocity. The formula for K is something like K = ( (G * (M_planet) * sin i) / (4π²) )^(1/3) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) )) )? Wait, I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, another way to think is that the RV method measures the star's velocity, which depends on the mass of the planet, the period, and the distance a.

Wait, the formula for the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (2π G) / (c P ) )^(1/3) ] * [ (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) ]

Hmm, but I'm not exactly remembering the formula correctly. Alternatively, another approach: the RV method gives the mass function, which relates to the planet's mass and the inclination angle. But without knowing the inclination, we can't get the exact mass, but in this question, both planets are detected via RV, so perhaps we can assume that their masses are known. Wait, but the question gives the planet masses as 7 and 5 Earth masses. So perhaps the RV data gives the mass, but the period as well.

Wait, the transit method gives the radius (since it's based on the dip in brightness) but RV gives the mass. But the question says both were detected using transit and RV methods, so we have masses and radii.

Wait, but the question is about equilibrium temperature, which depends on the distance from the star. So I need to find a1 and a2.

How to find a1 and a2? Well, for a circular orbit, the RV method gives the velocity semi-amplitude, which depends on the planet's mass, the period, and the distance a.

Wait, the formula for the semi-amplitude K is:

K = [ (G * P ) / (2π c^3) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) )

But I'm getting a bit tangled here. Another approach: The RV method gives the velocity of the star, which is related to the planet's orbit. The formula for velocity semi-amplitude is:

K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

But for planets, M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, so this simplifies to:

K ≈ (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) ) )

But without knowing the period, it's hard to get a. Wait, but the question gives the RV-induced Doppler shifts. Oh wait, the problem states that the shift for Planet1 is 0.03 Å, and Planet2 is 0.04 Å. So the RV semi-amplitude K is given by these shifts.

Wait, the Doppler shift (Δλ/λ) is proportional to velocity. The formula is Δλ/λ = v / c, where v is the velocity of the star towards or away from us. So for the forbidden line at 6300 Å, the shift is 0.03 Å for Planet1. So the velocity K1 for Planet1 is (0.03 / 6300) * c. Similarly, K2 is (0.04 / 6300) * c.

Wait, let me compute that. The speed of light c is approximately 3e5 km/s, but let's compute in km/s. So 0.03 /6300 = approximately 4.76e-6. Multiply by c (3e5 km/s) gives K1 = 4.76e-6 * 3e5 = ~1.428 km/s. Similarly, K2 would be 0.04/6300 = 6.349e-6. So K2 = 6.349e-6 * 3e5 = ~1.905 km/s. So K1 is approximately 1.428 km/s, K2 approximately 1.905 km/s.

So now, using the formula for K (semi-amplitude) as a function of planet mass, period, and distance a.

Recall that the formula for K is:

K = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2) * (1 - e²)^(3/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) / ( ( (2π/P) )^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the relation between K, period P, and a. The formula is:

K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

But since we don't have P, perhaps we can relate the periods using Kepler's third law. Kepler's law is P² = (4π²/(G M_star)) a³.

Wait, but maybe we can write a in terms of P, M_star, and G. Let me think.

Let me write down the knowns:

- M_star = 1.5 * M_sun
- M_p1 = 7 Earth masses
- M_p2 =5 Earth masses

But I think we can proceed by expressing a in terms of K, M_p, and P, and then find the ratio a1/a2.

Alternatively, since both planets orbit the same star, and given the K values (doppler shifts), perhaps we can find the ratio (a1/a2) from the ratio of their K values and their masses.

Wait, the formula for K is:

K = ( (G M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1/( (1 - e²)^(3/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

But for circular orbits, e=0, so that factor is 1. Also, M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

So K ≈ ( (G M_p )^(1) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) )^(1/3) ) / ( P^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to express P in terms of a using Kepler's third law. Remember that Kepler's law in the form:

P² = (4π² a³) / ( G M_star )

So P = (4π² a³/( G M_star ))^(1/2 )

So substituting into K expression:

K = ( (G M_p )^(1/3) ) / ( (M_star )^(2/3) ) * (1/(P^(1/3)) )

But P = (4π² a³/( G M_star ))^(1/2 )

So P^(1/3) = (4π² a³/( G M_star ))^(1/6 )

Substituting into K:

K = ( (G M_p )^(1/3) ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * ( G M_star / (4 π² a³ ) )^(1/6 )

Let me simplify this.

First, (G M_p )^(1/3) = G^(1/3) M_p^(1/3)

Denominator: M_star^(2/3)

So (G M_p )^(1/3) / M_star^(2/3) = (G^(1/3) M_p^(1/3)) ) / ( M_star^(2/3) )

Then, the other term: (G M_star / (4 π² a³ ))^(1/6 )

Which is G^(1/6) M_star^(1/6) (4 π² a³ )^(-1/6 )

Putting it all together:

K = [ G^(1/3) M_p^(1/3) / M_star^(2/3) ) ] * [ G^(1/6) M_star^(1/6) (4 π² a³ )^(-1/6) ) ]

Combine G terms: 1/3 + 1/6 = 1/2 → G^(1/2)

M_p terms: 1/3 → M_p^(1/3)

M_star terms: -2/3 + 1/6 = (-4/6 + 1/6) = -3/6 = -1/2 → M_star^(-1/2)

a terms: (-1/6)*3 = -1/2 → a^(-1/2)

4 π² term: (-1/6) → (4 π² )^(-1/6)

So combining all:

K = G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) * M_star^(-1/2) * a^(-1/2) / (4 π² )^(1/6 )

Hmm, that seems complicated. Let me see if I can write this as:

K = [ ( G M_p ) / ( M_star ) ]^(1/2) * [ (1/(4 π² a³ )) ]^(1/6 )

Wait, perhaps it's better to find the ratio of K1 and K2.

Let me compute K1/K2 = [ (M_p1) / (M_p2) ) * ( (a2)/(a1) )^(1/2) ) ]^(1/3) ? I'm not sure. Maybe I should go back to the K formula.

Wait, perhaps there's another approach. Let's write the formula for K in terms of a and M_p.

Alternatively, another approach is to use the formula for the RV semi-amplitude:

K = (v) = ( (27 * pi ) / (8 c^3) )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( M_star^(2/3) (1 - e^2)^(3/2) ) ) * ( (1 + M_p / M_star )^(1/3) ) ) / ( P^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I should look for a relation between the RV semi-amplitude and the planet's distance a.

Wait, another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G P )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ] / (2 pi c (M_star + M_p) )^(1/3) )

But again, without knowing P, this might not help. Maybe I can find the ratio of a1 to a2 by using the ratio of their K values and their masses.

Wait, perhaps the key is to find the ratio of a1 and a2, since the equilibrium temperature depends on a.

So, let's get back. Let me think about the RV semi-amplitude.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (v) ] = ( (2 pi G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( ( M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) * ( 1 / ( P^(1/3) ) )

But M_p is much smaller than M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, so K ≈ (2 pi G)^(1/3) * M_p sin i / ( M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

But from Kepler's third law, P² = (4 pi² a³ ) / ( G M_star )

So P = sqrt( (4 pi² a³ ) / ( G M_star ) )

So P^(1/3) = [ (4 pi² a³ ) / ( G M_star ) ) ]^(1/6 )

Which is (4 pi² )^(1/6) * a^(1/2) * (G M_star )^(-1/6 )

Substituting P^(1/3) into K equation:

K ≈ (2 pi G )^(1/3) * M_p / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * [ (4 pi² G M_star )^(-1/6 ) a^(-1/2) ) ]

Let me compute the constants.

(2 pi G )^(1/3) * (4 pi² )^(-1/6 ) 

Let me compute exponents:

(2 pi G )^(1/3) = 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3) G^(1/3)

(4 pi² )^(-1/6 ) = (2² pi² )^(-1/6 ) = 2^(-1/3) pi^(-1/3)

So when multiplied together:

2^(1/3) * 2^(-1/3) = 1

pi^(1/3) * pi^(-1/3) = 1

So the constants multiply to 1.

So K simplifies to:

K ≈ [ M_p ] / [ M_star^(2/3) (G M_star )^(1/6) a^(1/2) ) ]

Wait, perhaps not. Let me re-express everything.

Wait, let's collect all the terms:

- G^(1/3) from the first term and (G M_star )^(-1/6 ) from the second. So:

G^(1/3 - 1/6 ) = G^(1/6 )

M_star terms: from M_star^(-2/3) and M_star^(-1/6 ), so total exponent is (-2/3 -1/6 )= -5/6.

So now:

K ≈ ( M_p ) * [ G^(1/6) ] * [ M_star^(-5/6) ] * a^(-1/2 )

Wait, that's getting complicated, but perhaps I can rearrange terms to solve for a.

Let me express a in terms of K.

From K = [ (M_p) G^(1/6) M_star^(-5/6) ) ] / a^(1/2 )

Wait, perhaps it's better to write a^(1/2) = [ (M_p) G^(1/6) M_star^(-5/6) ) ] / K

Then a = [ ( M_p G^(1/6) M_star^(-5/6) ) / K ) ]^2 

But this seems messy. Alternatively, taking the ratio of a1 and a2.

Let me compute a1 / a2.

From the formula above, a is proportional to (M_p / K )^2 * ( G M_star^5 )^(-1/3 ) )

Wait, perhaps a is proportional to ( M_p^2 * (G M_star^5 )^(-1/3 ) ) / K² )

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think differently.

Another approach: For each planet, K is proportional to (M_p / a^(1/2) ), because when you look at the K equation, after simplifying, K is proportional to (M_p)/(a^0.5) times other factors.

Wait, K is proportional to (M_p) / (a^0.5) because from earlier steps, K ≈ (2 pi G)^(1/3) * ... but maybe it's better to find the ratio K1/K2.

So K1/K2 = (M_p1 / M_p2 ) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Because, when you take the ratio, the a terms would be sqrt(a2/a1) because K is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). So:

K1/K2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( sqrt(a2/a1) )

But wait, if K is proportional to (M_p)/sqrt(a), then K1/K2 = (M_p1 / M_p2) * (a2/a1)^0.5

So rearranging:

a2/a1 = (K1/K2 )² * ( M_p2 / M_p1 )

Wait, because:

(K1/K2) = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * sqrt(a2/a1 )

Square both sides:

(K1²)/(K2²) = ( M_p1² / M_p2² ) * (a2/a1 )

So,

a2/a1 = (K1²/K2²) * ( M_p2² / M_p1² )

Wait, no, wait:

Wait, let me do it step by step.

Let me denote:

K1 = (something) * ( M_p1 ) / sqrt(a1 )

K2 = (something) * ( M_p2 ) / sqrt(a2 )

So the ratio K1/K2 = (M_p1 / M_p2) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So,

(K1/K2) = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * sqrt( a2/a1 )

We can solve for a2/a1:

sqrt(a2/a1 ) = ( K1/K2 ) * ( M_p2 / M_p1 )

Square both sides:

a2/a1 = ( K1² / K2² ) * ( M_p2² / M_p1² )

So,

a2/a1 = ( (K1/K2)^2 ) * ( (M_p2/M_p1)^2 )

So, putting in the numbers:

K1 = 1.428 km/s (approx), K2 = 1.905 km/s.

So K1/K2 ≈ 1.428 / 1.905 ≈ 0.75

M_p1 =7 Earth masses, M_p2=5 Earth masses → M_p2/M_p1 =5/7 ≈0.714

So,

a2/a1 = (0.75)^2 * (0.714)^2 ≈ (0.5625) * (0.51) ≈ 0.287

So a2 ≈0.287 a1 → a1 ≈ a2 / 0.287 ≈ 3.48 a2

Wait, wait. No, wait. Let me compute a1/a2 which is reciprocal.

Wait, a2/a1 =0.287 → a1/a2=1/0.287≈3.48.

So a1 is about 3.48 times a2.

So the ratio a1/a2 is approximately 3.48.

Wait, but let me compute it more precisely. Let's compute K1 and K2 accurately.

Compute K1:

Δλ =0.03 Å, λ=6300 Å. So v1 = (Δλ/λ) * c.

c is 3e5 km/s. So v1= (0.03/6300) * 3e5 = (0.03 *3e5 ) /6300 → (9e3) /6300 = 1.42857 km/s.

v1 =1.42857 km/s.

Similarly, v2= (0.04/6300) *3e5 = (0.04 *3e5)/6300 → (1.2e4)/6300 ≈ 1.90476 km/s.

So K1=1.42857 km/s, K2=1.90476 km/s.

Ratio K1/K2=1.42857/1.90476 ≈0.75.

So, a2/a1 = (0.75)^2 * (5/7)^2 → (0.5625) * (25/49) → (0.5625)*(0.5102) ≈0.287.

So a1/a2 ≈3.48.

So the ratio a1/a2 is about 3.48.

Wait, but wait, equilibrium temperature T is proportional to sqrt( R_* / (2 a ) ), so T ∝ 1/sqrt(a).

So T1 / T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Because T ∝ 1/sqrt(a), so T1 = T2 * sqrt(a2/a1 )

So T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 )

But a2/a1 is 0.287. So sqrt(0.287 )≈0.536.

So the ratio T1/T2 ≈0.536.

Looking at options, option C is ~0.53. So the answer would be C.

To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we start by recalling the formula for equilibrium temperature:

\[
T_{\text{planet}} = T_{\text{star}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{2a}} \cdot \left(1 - \text{albedo}\right)^{1/4}
\]

Since both planets have the same albedo, the \((1 - \text{albedo})^{1/4}\) factor cancels out in the ratio. Thus, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures depends only on the square root of the inverse ratio of their orbital distances:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

To find \(a_1/a_2\), we use the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude \(K\), which is proportional to the planet's mass and inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance:

\[
K \propto \frac{M_p}{\sqrt{a}}
\]

Rearranging, the ratio of semi-major axes can be expressed as:

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\right)^2
\]

From the problem, the RV shifts are \(K_1 = 1.428 \, \text{km/s}\) (for Planet1) and \(K_2 = 1.905 \, \text{km/s}\) (for Planet2). The planet masses are \(M_{p1} = 7 \, M_{\text{Earth}}\) and \(M_{p2} = 5 \, M_{\text{Earth}}\). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \left(\frac{1.428}{1.905}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^2
\]

First, calculate \(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\):

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{1.428}{1.905} \approx 0.75
\]

Then, square this ratio:

\[
\left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^2 = 0.75^2 = 0.5625
\]

Next, calculate \(\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\):

\[
\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \frac{5}{7} \approx 0.714
\]

Square this ratio:

\[
\left(\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\right)^2 = 0.714^2 \approx 0.51
\]

Now, multiply the two results:

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} = 0.5625 \cdot 0.51 \approx 0.287
\]

Thus, the ratio of semi-major axes is:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{1}{0.287} \approx 3.48
\]

Finally, substitute \(\frac{a_2}{a_1} = 0.287\) into the equilibrium temperature ratio formula:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \sqrt{0.287} \approx 0.536
\]

The closest option to this value is **C) ~0.53**.

Okay, so I have this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says there are two planets orbiting a star. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 times the sun's, and an effective temperature of 6300 K. Planet1 is 7 Earth masses with radius 1.7 Earths, and Planet2 is 5 Earth masses with radius 1.3 Earths. Both orbits are circular. The question is about their equilibrium temperatures.

Wait, equilibrium temperature. Right, that's the temperature a planet would have if it's in thermal equilibrium, considering the energy it absorbs and emits. The formula I remember is something like T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.25. Oh wait, albedo is the same for both planets, so that factor cancels out in the ratio.

So the star's Teff is 6300 K. But wait, in the formula, the star's temperature part is (Teff)^4, right? Because the flux goes as T^4 (Stefan-Boltzmann law). Oh, but in this case, the star's Teff is given, so maybe I can model the star's luminosity.

Wait, the star's luminosity is proportional to R^2 * Teff^4. So L = 4πR²σTeff^4. But for the equilibrium temperature, the planet's distance from the star (a) matters.

Wait, the equilibrium temperature formula for a planet is T_planet = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * sqrt( (1 - albedo) )^0.25. Wait, no, let me think again. The formula I remember is T_p = T_* * sqrt(R_* / (2a)) ) * ( ( (1 - A) )^(1/4) ), where A is the albedo.

Wait, but in this case, the albedos are the same for both planets, so the (1 - A) factor would be the same, so when taking the ratio, it would cancel. So the ratio T1/T2 would depend on the sqrt(R_* / (2a1)) divided by sqrt(R_* / (2a2)) ), which simplifies to sqrt(a2/a1). So T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1). Hmm, that's if the star's Teff is the same, which it is here since it's the same star.

But wait, how do I find the semi-major axes, a, for each planet? Because the RV method gives the mass and the period. Oh wait, the question mentions that the RV method detected the planets. The RV shift gives the mass of the planet and the period (if you have the star's mass). Oh wait, the RV method gives the velocity semi-amplitude, which depends on the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the distance (a). But since both planets are orbiting the same star, their periods can be determined, but the question doesn't give periods. Hmm.

Wait, the question gives the RV shifts for each planet. Oh wait, the RV shift is related to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The RV shift (K) is given by K = (v * sin i) where v is the star's velocity. The formula for K is something like K = ( (G * (M_planet) * sin i) / (4π²) )^(1/3) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) )) )? Wait, I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, another way to think is that the RV method measures the star's velocity, which depends on the mass of the planet, the period, and the distance a.

Wait, the formula for the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (2π G) / (c P ) )^(1/3) ] * [ (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) ]

Hmm, but I'm not exactly remembering the formula correctly. Alternatively, another approach: the RV method gives the mass function, which relates to the planet's mass and the inclination angle. But without knowing the inclination, we can't get the exact mass, but in this question, both planets are detected via RV, so perhaps we can assume that their masses are known. Wait, but the question gives the planet masses as 7 and 5 Earth masses. So perhaps the RV data gives the mass, but the period as well.

Wait, the transit method gives the radius (since it's based on the dip in brightness) but RV gives the mass. But the question says both were detected using transit and RV methods, so we have masses and radii.

Wait, but the question is about equilibrium temperature, which depends on the distance from the star. So I need to find a1 and a2.

How to find a1 and a2? Well, for a circular orbit, the RV method gives the velocity semi-amplitude, which depends on the planet's mass, the period, and the distance a.

Wait, the formula for the semi-amplitude K is:

K = [ (G * P ) / (2π c^3) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) )

But I'm getting a bit tangled here. Another approach: The RV method gives the velocity of the star, which is related to the planet's orbit. The formula for velocity semi-amplitude is:

K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

But for planets, M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, so this simplifies to:

K ≈ (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) ) )

But without knowing the period, it's hard to get a. Wait, but the question gives the RV-induced Doppler shifts. Oh wait, the problem states that the shift for Planet1 is 0.03 Å, and Planet2 is 0.04 Å. So the RV semi-amplitude K is given by these shifts.

Wait, the Doppler shift (Δλ/λ) is proportional to velocity. The formula is Δλ/λ = v / c, where v is the velocity of the star towards or away from us. So for the forbidden line at 6300 Å, the shift is 0.03 Å for Planet1. So the velocity K1 for Planet1 is (0.03 / 6300) * c. Similarly, K2 is (0.04 / 6300) * c.

Wait, let me compute that. The speed of light c is approximately 3e5 km/s, but let's compute in km/s. So 0.03 /6300 = approximately 4.76e-6. Multiply by c (3e5 km/s) gives K1 = 4.76e-6 * 3e5 = ~1.428 km/s. Similarly, K2 would be 0.04/6300 = 6.349e-6. So K2 = 6.349e-6 * 3e5 = ~1.905 km/s. So K1 is approximately 1.428 km/s, K2 approximately 1.905 km/s.

So now, using the formula for K (semi-amplitude) as a function of planet mass, period, and distance a.

Recall that the formula for K is:

K = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2) * (1 - e²)^(3/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) / ( ( (2π/P) )^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the relation between K, period P, and a. The formula is:

K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

But since we don't have P, perhaps we can relate the periods using Kepler's third law. Kepler's law is P² = (4π²/(G M_star)) a³.

Wait, but maybe we can write a in terms of P, M_star, and G. Let me think.

Let me write down the knowns:

- M_star = 1.5 * M_sun
- M_p1 = 7 Earth masses
- M_p2 =5 Earth masses

But I think we can proceed by expressing a in terms of K, M_p, and P, and then find the ratio a1/a2.

Alternatively, since both planets orbit the same star, and given the K values (doppler shifts), perhaps we can find the ratio (a1/a2) from the ratio of their K values and their masses.

Wait, the formula for K is:

K = ( (G M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1/( (1 - e²)^(3/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

But for circular orbits, e=0, so that factor is 1. Also, M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

So K ≈ ( (G M_p )^(1) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) )^(1/3) ) / ( P^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to express P in terms of a using Kepler's third law. Remember that Kepler's law in the form:

P² = (4π² a³) / ( G M_star )

So P = (4π² a³/( G M_star ))^(1/2 )

So substituting into K expression:

K = ( (G M_p )^(1/3) ) / ( (M_star )^(2/3) ) * (1/(P^(1/3)) )

But P = (4π² a³/( G M_star ))^(1/2 )

So P^(1/3) = (4π² a³/( G M_star ))^(1/6 )

Substituting into K:

K = ( (G M_p )^(1/3) ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * ( G M_star / (4 π² a³ ) )^(1/6 )

Let me simplify this.

First, (G M_p )^(1/3) = G^(1/3) M_p^(1/3)

Denominator: M_star^(2/3)

So (G M_p )^(1/3) / M_star^(2/3) = (G^(1/3) M_p^(1/3)) ) / ( M_star^(2/3) )

Then, the other term: (G M_star / (4 π² a³ ))^(1/6 )

Which is G^(1/6) M_star^(1/6) (4 π² a³ )^(-1/6 )

Putting it all together:

K = [ G^(1/3) M_p^(1/3) / M_star^(2/3) ) ] * [ G^(1/6) M_star^(1/6) (4 π² a³ )^(-1/6) ) ]

Combine G terms: 1/3 + 1/6 = 1/2 → G^(1/2)

M_p terms: 1/3 → M_p^(1/3)

M_star terms: -2/3 + 1/6 = (-4/6 + 1/6) = -3/6 = -1/2 → M_star^(-1/2)

a terms: (-1/6)*3 = -1/2 → a^(-1/2)

4 π² term: (-1/6) → (4 π² )^(-1/6)

So combining all:

K = G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) * M_star^(-1/2) * a^(-1/2) / (4 π² )^(1/6 )

Hmm, that seems complicated. Let me see if I can write this as:

K = [ ( G M_p ) / ( M_star ) ]^(1/2) * [ (1/(4 π² a³ )) ]^(1/6 )

Wait, perhaps it's better to find the ratio of K1 and K2.

Let me compute K1/K2 = [ (M_p1) / (M_p2) ) * ( (a2)/(a1) )^(1/2) ) ]^(1/3) ? I'm not sure. Maybe I should go back to the K formula.

Wait, perhaps there's another approach. Let's write the formula for K in terms of a and M_p.

Alternatively, another approach is to use the formula for the RV semi-amplitude:

K = (v) = ( (27 * pi ) / (8 c^3) )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( M_star^(2/3) (1 - e^2)^(3/2) ) ) * ( (1 + M_p / M_star )^(1/3) ) ) / ( P^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I should look for a relation between the RV semi-amplitude and the planet's distance a.

Wait, another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G P )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ] / (2 pi c (M_star + M_p) )^(1/3) )

But again, without knowing P, this might not help. Maybe I can find the ratio of a1 to a2 by using the ratio of their K values and their masses.

Wait, perhaps the key is to find the ratio of a1 and a2, since the equilibrium temperature depends on a.

So, let's get back. Let me think about the RV semi-amplitude.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (v) ] = ( (2 pi G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( ( M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) * ( 1 / ( P^(1/3) ) )

But M_p is much smaller than M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, so K ≈ (2 pi G)^(1/3) * M_p sin i / ( M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

But from Kepler's third law, P² = (4 pi² a³ ) / ( G M_star )

So P = sqrt( (4 pi² a³ ) / ( G M_star ) )

So P^(1/3) = [ (4 pi² a³ ) / ( G M_star ) ) ]^(1/6 )

Which is (4 pi² )^(1/6) * a^(1/2) * (G M_star )^(-1/6 )

Substituting P^(1/3) into K equation:

K ≈ (2 pi G )^(1/3) * M_p / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * [ (4 pi² G M_star )^(-1/6 ) a^(-1/2) ) ]

Let me compute the constants.

(2 pi G )^(1/3) * (4 pi² )^(-1/6 ) 

Let me compute exponents:

(2 pi G )^(1/3) = 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3) G^(1/3)

(4 pi² )^(-1/6 ) = (2² pi² )^(-1/6 ) = 2^(-1/3) pi^(-1/3)

So when multiplied together:

2^(1/3) * 2^(-1/3) = 1

pi^(1/3) * pi^(-1/3) = 1

So the constants multiply to 1.

So K simplifies to:

K ≈ [ M_p ] / [ M_star^(2/3) (G M_star )^(1/6) a^(1/2) ) ]

Wait, perhaps not. Let me re-express everything.

Wait, let's collect all the terms:

- G^(1/3) from the first term and (G M_star )^(-1/6 ) from the second. So:

G^(1/3 - 1/6 ) = G^(1/6 )

M_star terms: from M_star^(-2/3) and M_star^(-1/6 ), so total exponent is (-2/3 -1/6 )= -5/6.

So now:

K ≈ ( M_p ) * [ G^(1/6) ] * [ M_star^(-5/6) ] * a^(-1/2 )

Wait, that's getting complicated, but perhaps I can rearrange terms to solve for a.

Let me express a in terms of K.

From K = [ (M_p) G^(1/6) M_star^(-5/6) ) ] / a^(1/2 )

Wait, perhaps it's better to write a^(1/2) = [ (M_p) G^(1/6) M_star^(-5/6) ) ] / K

Then a = [ ( M_p G^(1/6) M_star^(-5/6) ) / K ) ]^2 

But this seems messy. Alternatively, taking the ratio of a1 and a2.

Let me compute a1 / a2.

From the formula above, a is proportional to (M_p / K )^2 * ( G M_star^5 )^(-1/3 ) )

Wait, perhaps a is proportional to ( M_p^2 * (G M_star^5 )^(-1/3 ) ) / K² )

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think differently.

Another approach: For each planet, K is proportional to (M_p / a^(1/2) ), because when you look at the K equation, after simplifying, K is proportional to (M_p)/(a^0.5) times other factors.

Wait, K is proportional to (M_p) / (a^0.5) because from earlier steps, K ≈ (2 pi G)^(1/3) * ... but maybe it's better to find the ratio K1/K2.

So K1/K2 = (M_p1 / M_p2 ) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Because, when you take the ratio, the a terms would be sqrt(a2/a1) because K is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). So:

K1/K2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( sqrt(a2/a1) )

But wait, if K is proportional to (M_p)/sqrt(a), then K1/K2 = (M_p1 / M_p2) * (a2/a1)^0.5

So rearranging:

a2/a1 = (K1/K2 )² * ( M_p2 / M_p1 )

Wait, because:

(K1/K2) = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * sqrt(a2/a1 )

Square both sides:

(K1²)/(K2²) = ( M_p1² / M_p2² ) * (a2/a1 )

So,

a2/a1 = (K1²/K2²) * ( M_p2² / M_p1² )

Wait, no, wait:

Wait, let me do it step by step.

Let me denote:

K1 = (something) * ( M_p1 ) / sqrt(a1 )

K2 = (something) * ( M_p2 ) / sqrt(a2 )

So the ratio K1/K2 = (M_p1 / M_p2) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So,

(K1/K2) = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * sqrt( a2/a1 )

We can solve for a2/a1:

sqrt(a2/a1 ) = ( K1/K2 ) * ( M_p2 / M_p1 )

Square both sides:

a2/a1 = ( K1² / K2² ) * ( M_p2² / M_p1² )

So,

a2/a1 = ( (K1/K2)^2 ) * ( (M_p2/M_p1)^2 )

So, putting in the numbers:

K1 = 1.428 km/s (approx), K2 = 1.905 km/s.

So K1/K2 ≈ 1.428 / 1.905 ≈ 0.75

M_p1 =7 Earth masses, M_p2=5 Earth masses → M_p2/M_p1 =5/7 ≈0.714

So,

a2/a1 = (0.75)^2 * (0.714)^2 ≈ (0.5625) * (0.51) ≈ 0.287

So a2 ≈0.287 a1 → a1 ≈ a2 / 0.287 ≈ 3.48 a2

Wait, wait. No, wait. Let me compute a1/a2 which is reciprocal.

Wait, a2/a1 =0.287 → a1/a2=1/0.287≈3.48.

So a1 is about 3.48 times a2.

So the ratio a1/a2 is approximately 3.48.

Wait, but let me compute it more precisely. Let's compute K1 and K2 accurately.

Compute K1:

Δλ =0.03 Å, λ=6300 Å. So v1 = (Δλ/λ) * c.

c is 3e5 km/s. So v1= (0.03/6300) * 3e5 = (0.03 *3e5 ) /6300 → (9e3) /6300 = 1.42857 km/s.

v1 =1.42857 km/s.

Similarly, v2= (0.04/6300) *3e5 = (0.04 *3e5)/6300 → (1.2e4)/6300 ≈ 1.90476 km/s.

So K1=1.42857 km/s, K2=1.90476 km/s.

Ratio K1/K2=1.42857/1.90476 ≈0.75.

So, a2/a1 = (0.75)^2 * (5/7)^2 → (0.5625) * (25/49) → (0.5625)*(0.5102) ≈0.287.

So a1/a2 ≈3.48.

So the ratio a1/a2 is about 3.48.

Wait, but wait, equilibrium temperature T is proportional to sqrt( R_* / (2 a ) ), so T ∝ 1/sqrt(a).

So T1 / T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Because T ∝ 1/sqrt(a), so T1 = T2 * sqrt(a2/a1 )

So T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 )

But a2/a1 is 0.287. So sqrt(0.287 )≈0.536.

So the ratio T1/T2 ≈0.536.

Looking at options, option C is ~0.53. So the answer would be C.


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we start by recalling the formula for equilibrium temperature:

\[
T_{\text{planet}} = T_{\text{star}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{2a}} \cdot \left(1 - \text{albedo}\right)^{1/4}
\]

Since both planets have the same albedo, the \((1 - \text{albedo})^{1/4}\) factor cancels out in the ratio. Thus, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures depends only on the square root of the inverse ratio of their orbital distances:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

To find \(a_1/a_2\), we use the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude \(K\), which is proportional to the planet's mass and inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance:

\[
K \propto \frac{M_p}{\sqrt{a}}
\]

Rearranging, the ratio of semi-major axes can be expressed as:

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\right)^2
\]

From the problem, the RV shifts are \(K_1 = 1.428 \, \text{km/s}\) (for Planet1) and \(K_2 = 1.905 \, \text{km/s}\) (for Planet2). The planet masses are \(M_{p1} = 7 \, M_{\text{Earth}}\) and \(M_{p2} = 5 \, M_{\text{Earth}}\). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \left(\frac{1.428}{1.905}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^2
\]

First, calculate \(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\):

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{1.428}{1.905} \approx 0.75
\]

Then, square this ratio:

\[
\left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^2 = 0.75^2 = 0.5625
\]

Next, calculate \(\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\):

\[
\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \frac{5}{7} \approx 0.714
\]

Square this ratio:

\[
\left(\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\right)^2 = 0.714^2 \approx 0.51
\]

Now, multiply the two results:

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} = 0.5625 \cdot 0.51 \approx 0.287
\]

Thus, the ratio of semi-major axes is:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{1}{0.287} \approx 3.48
\]

Finally, substitute \(\frac{a_2}{a_1} = 0.287\) into the equilibrium temperature ratio formula:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \sqrt{0.287} \approx 0.536
\]

The closest option to this value is **C) ~0.53**.

Answer: C
