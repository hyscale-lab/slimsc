Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the uncertainty in the Pz operator, given that the system is in a specific eigenstate of Px. Hmm, okay, let's start by understanding what's given.

First, the operators Px, Py, and Pz are given as matrices. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz. So, the system is expressed in the eigenbasis of Pz. I remember that the uncertainty principle between two observables A and B is given by ΔA ΔB ≥ (1/2)|⟨[A,B]⟩|. But wait, that might be getting ahead of myself. Let's see what we need to do here.

The system is in an eigenstate of Px with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). So, this is the state vector in the Pz eigenbasis. I need to compute the uncertainty of Pz in this state, which is ΔPz. 

The uncertainty in an observable is calculated as the square root of the expectation of the square minus the square of the expectation. So ΔPz = sqrt(⟨Pz²⟩ - ⟨Pz⟩²).

Wait, but how do I compute that? Let's break it down. I need to compute ⟨Pz⟩ and ⟨Pz²⟩ for the given state.

Since the state is already in the eigenbasis of Pz, this should be straightforward. Because in the eigenbasis of an operator, the expectation value is just the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by the probabilities (squares of the amplitudes) of each eigenstate.

So, let's think about the structure of the Pz matrix. From the problem, the matrix for Pz is:
Row 1: [ħ, 0, 0]
Row 2: [0, 0, 0]
Row 3: [0, 0, -ħ]

So the eigenvalues of Pz are ħ, 0, and -ħ, corresponding to the diagonal elements. Each of these eigenvalues corresponds to the basis vectors, which are the eigenvectors of Pz. So the state is a linear combination of these eigenstates.

Wait, the given state vector is already expressed in this basis. So each component of the vector corresponds to the coefficient (amplitude) of the respective eigenstate.

Looking at the state vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let's denote the basis vectors as |1⟩, |2⟩, |3⟩, where |1⟩ corresponds to eigenvalue ħ, |2⟩ to 0, and |3⟩ to -ħ.

So the state is ψ = (-1/2)|1⟩ + (1/√2)|2⟩ + (-1/2)|3⟩.

So, the probabilities (squares of the amplitudes) are:

For |1⟩: (-1/2)^2 = 1/4
For |2⟩: (1/√2)^2 = 1/2
For |3⟩: (-1/2)^2 = 1/4

Now, to compute ⟨Pz⟩, which is the expectation value of Pz in state ψ. Since each basis vector is an eigenstate, the expectation value is the sum of (eigenvalue * probability). So,

⟨Pz⟩ = (ħ)(1/4) + (0)(1/2) + (-ħ)(1/4)
= ħ/4 - ħ/4 = 0.

That's convenient. So ⟨Pz⟩ is zero. What about ⟨Pz²⟩? Since Pz is diagonal in this basis, Pz^2 would have the squares of the eigenvalues on the diagonal. So, the eigenvalues of Pz squared are ħ², 0, and ħ².

So,

⟨Pz²⟩ = (ħ²)(1/4) + (0)^2*(1/2) + (ħ²)(1/4)
= (ħ²/4) + (0) + (ħ²/4)
= ħ²/2.

So,

ΔPz = sqrt(⟨Pz²⟩ - ⟨Pz⟩²) = sqrt(ħ²/2 - 0) = (ħ)/√2.

Wait a second, let me double-check. The uncertainty is the square root of (⟨Pz²⟩ - ⟨Pz⟩²). Since ⟨Pz⟩ is zero, it's just the square root of ⟨Pz²⟩. And ⟨Pz²⟩ is (1/4 + 1/4) ħ², which is (1/2) ħ². So the square root is ħ / sqrt(2), which is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it more directly. Let me compute ψ† Pz² ψ.

Pz squared matrix would be:

[ (ħ)^2, 0, 0 ]
[ 0, 0, 0 ]
[ 0, 0, (-ħ)^2 ] = [ħ², 0, 0; 0, 0, 0; 0,0, ħ²]

So when we multiply Pz² by ψ, we get:

(ħ²)(-1/2) |1⟩ + 0 |2⟩ + ħ² (-1/2) |3⟩.

Then, taking the inner product with ψ:

ψ† (Pz² ψ ) = [ (-1/2), (1/√2), (-1/2) ] multiplied by [ (ħ²)(-1/2), 0, (ħ²)(-1/2) ) ]

Wait, no, perhaps I should write it as a matrix multiplication:

Pz squared is diagonal, so applying it to ψ gives:

(ħ² * (-1/2), 0 * (1/√2), ħ² * (-1/2) ) = ( -ħ²/2, 0, -ħ²/2 )

Then, the inner product ψ† Pz² ψ is the sum of the product of each component of ψ with the corresponding component of Pz² ψ.

So:

( (-1/2)^* ) * (-ħ²/2) + (1/√2)^* * 0 + ( (-1/2)^* ) * (-ħ²/2 )

Since all the coefficients are real here, the complex conjugate doesn't change anything.

So:

(1/2)(-ħ²/2) + 0 + (1/2)(-ħ²/2 )

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the first term is (-1/2) * (-ħ²/2) = (1/2)(ħ²/2) = ħ²/(4).

Similarly, the third term is (-1/2) * (-ħ²/2) = ħ²/(4).

So the sum is ħ²/4 + 0 + ħ²/4 = ħ²/2.

Which matches what I calculated earlier. So ⟨Pz²⟩ is indeed ħ²/2, and since ⟨Pz⟩ is zero, the uncertainty is sqrt( ħ²/2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2 ). So the answer is option B.

To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$ for the given quantum state, we proceed as follows:

### Key Information:
1. The system is in the eigenstate of $P_x$ with eigenvalue $-\hbar$, and the state is explicitly given as the column vector:
   \[
   \psi = \begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]
   This state is expressed in the eigenbasis of $P_z$, where the basis vectors correspond to the eigenvalues of $P_z$.

2. The matrix representation of $P_z$ is diagonal with eigenvalues $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$:
   \[
   P_z = \begin{pmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

3. The uncertainty in $P_z$ is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
   \]

### Calculation:
1. **Expectation Value of $P_z$ ($\langle P_z \rangle$):**
   Since the state is in the eigenbasis of $P_z$, the expectation value is the weighted sum of the eigenvalues, where the weights are the probabilities (squares of the amplitudes) of the state components:
   \[
   \langle P_z \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot \hbar + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 \cdot 0 + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot (-\hbar).
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   \langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = 0.
   \]

2. **Expectation Value of $P_z^2$ ($\langle P_z^2 \rangle$):**
   The eigenvalues of $P_z^2$ are the squares of the eigenvalues of $P_z$, i.e., $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. Using the same probabilities:
   \[
   \langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 \cdot 0 + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   \langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
   \]

3. **Uncertainty in $P_z$ ($\Delta P_z$):**
   Substituting $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$ and $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}$ into the uncertainty formula:
   \[
   \Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
   \]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty in $P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to **Option B**.
