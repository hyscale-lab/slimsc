Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to determine the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly distinguished.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the lifetime of a state is related to its uncertainty in energy. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! It says that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is approximately equal to ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Oh wait, the exact formula is ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. Or maybe it's ħ/(2π) sometimes? I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

So the lifetimes given are the times for which each state exists before decaying, I think. So the uncertainty in time Δt for each state would be related to their lifetimes. But wait, how exactly? I think the lifetime τ is the average time a state exists, so the uncertainty in time Δt would be about τ. Or perhaps it's half of that? Or maybe it's the same as τ. I'm not too sure, but I'll proceed with Δt ≈ τ for now.

So for each state, the uncertainty in energy is ΔE ≈ ħ / (2τ). Because the uncertainty principle is ΔE Δt ≈ ħ/2. So rearranging, ΔE ≈ ħ/(2Δt). Since Δt is the lifetime τ here.

Wait, but in the question, each state has its own lifetime. But the energy difference between the two states would depend on the larger uncertainty, perhaps? Or maybe the energy difference needs to be larger than the sum of the uncertainties? Hmm, not sure. Let me think.

Wait, the problem is about distinguishing two energy levels. So the energy difference between them (ΔE) must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Because if the difference is smaller than the uncertainty, you can't tell them apart. So the energy difference needs to be bigger than the maximum uncertainty from either state, I guess.

Wait, wait. Let me get this straight. Each state's energy has an uncertainty because of their lifetimes. So the uncertainty in E1 would be ΔE1 = ħ/(2τ1), and for E2, ΔE2 = ħ/(2τ2).

Wait, but maybe I should calculate the natural linewidth or something. Oh right, in spectroscopy, the uncertainty in energy is related to the lifetime of the state. So the energy width (ΔE) is approximately ħ/τ.

Wait, no, maybe it's ħ/(2πτ). Because the natural linewidth is given by Γ = ħ/(τ), where Γ is the energy width, or the uncertainty in energy. Or wait, let me get the exact formula right. I think the relation is ΔE ≈ ħ/τ, but I'm not 100% confident. Alternatively, sometimes it's written as ΔE ≈ ħ/(2π τ), because the Fourier transform of a Lorentzian (which comes from the exponential decay) gives a line width (full width at half maximum) Γ = ħ/(τ), and the uncertainty in energy ΔE is Γ/2 or something like that. Hmm, this part is a bit confusing.

Alternatively, another approach. The uncertainty principle: ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. If Δt is the lifetime, then ΔE_min = ħ/(2Δt). So for each state, the minimum detectable energy difference is this. To resolve two states, the actual energy difference must be larger than the sum of these minimums? Or maybe the larger of the two?

Wait, but perhaps the question is more straightforward. The question is which energy difference allows us to clearly distinguish the two levels. So the energy difference should be greater than the uncertainty in energy of each state, perhaps. Or perhaps the sum of their uncertainties.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think of the problem in terms of Fourier transforms and line widths. When you have a state with a short lifetime, its energy is more uncertain. So in spectroscopy, a shorter lifetime (lower τ) gives a broader line. So when you have two lines, their separation must be larger than the sum of their widths to resolve them.

Wait, but in that case, the energy difference ΔE between E1 and E2 should be larger than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties, perhaps. Because if the lines are too close, they blend together, and you can't tell them apart.

So the formula for the energy uncertainty for each state would be ΔE1 = ħ/(2τ1), ΔE2 = ħ/(2τ2). So the total uncertainty would be ΔE1 + ΔE2. So the separation ΔE between E1 and E2 should be larger than ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Alternatively, maybe the individual uncertainties are enough that each line is broader than the other, so the separation just needs to be larger than the larger of the two. Hmm, I'm not sure. Let's proceed with the first idea, that ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Let me compute ΔE1 and ΔE2.

First, let's get the values:

τ1 = 1e-9 seconds = 1 ns

τ2 = 1e-8 seconds = 10 ns

Compute ΔE1 and ΔE2.

But wait, Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. So ħ = h/(2π) ≈ 1.05457e-34 J·s.

So ΔE1 = ħ/(2 τ1) = (1.05457e-34) / (2 * 1e-9) ) = (1.05457e-34) / (2e-9) ) = 5.27285e-26 J.

Wait, but we need to convert this into electron volts because the options are in eV.

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So to convert J to eV, divide by 1.602e-19.

ΔE1 (in eV) = (5.27285e-26 J) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ 3.29e-7 eV.

Wait, that's 3.29e-7 eV, which is 0.329 μeV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = ħ/(2 τ2) = (1.05457e-34) / (2e-8) ) = 1.05457e-34 / 2e-8 = 5.27285e-27 J.

Convert to eV: 5.27285e-27 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = 3.29e-8 eV.

So, ΔE1 ≈ 3.29e-7 eV, ΔE2 ≈ 3.29e-8 eV.

So the sum of ΔE1 and ΔE2 would be approximately 3.62e-7 eV.

So for the two energy levels to be distinguishable, the energy difference ΔE should be greater than 3.62e-7 eV. So looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 eV → 0.001 n eV? That's way smaller than 3.6e-7 eV. So no.

B) 1e-11 eV → 0.01e-9 eV → way too small.

C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV. That's 1e-4 eV, which is 1e4 times larger than 3.6e-7. So this is way bigger than the required.

D) 1e-8 eV → 0.00000001 eV. That's 1e-8 eV, which is about 0.03 times 3.6e-7 eV. So 1e-8 is smaller than 3.6e-7, so it's not enough.

Wait, but wait. Did I miscalculate the sum? Let me see:

3.29e-7 (ΔE1) plus 3.29e-8 (ΔE2) equals 3.619e-7 eV. So the energy difference has to be larger than that. So the only option that's larger is option C, 1e-4 eV.

So the correct answer should be option C.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the minimum required as the maximum of the two uncertainties. Because for each energy level, the other's uncertainty is smaller, so perhaps the main constraint is the larger one, which is ΔE1.

Wait, but the energy difference between the two states needs to be larger than the sum of their uncertainties, because if their uncertainties overlap, you can't distinguish them. But perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, think about the line widths. Each state has its own line width. The line width for E1 is about 2ΔE1, and for E2 it's 2ΔE2. So the separation between the two lines must be larger than the sum of their half-widths. Wait, but in reality, the lorentzian lines have a certain width, and the separation must be more than the sum of their half-widths to be resolvable. Because if the separation is less than the sum, the lines would overlap.

So the minimum separation required is when the separation is greater than the sum of their half-widths.

But in any case, the required energy difference is larger than 3.6e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV = 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 divided by 1e-7 is 1000 times larger. So that's way more than enough.

So the correct answer is option C.

To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish the two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the uncertainty in energy (\( \Delta E \)) to the uncertainty in time (\( \Delta t \)) as:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}.
\]

Here, the lifetimes (\( \tau \)) of the two states are given as \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \). Assuming \( \Delta t \approx \tau \), the minimum energy uncertainty for each state is:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{2\tau_1}, \quad \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{2\tau_2}.
\]

Using \( \hbar \approx 1.05457 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and converting the results to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{1.05457 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} \, \text{J} = 5.27285 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}, \quad \Delta E_1 \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{1.05457 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} \, \text{J} = 5.27285 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}, \quad \Delta E_2 \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference (\( \Delta E \)) must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} + 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \approx 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Now, evaluate the options:

- **A) \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \) is much smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is insufficient.
- **B) \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \) is also much smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is insufficient.
- **C) \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) is \( 10^3 \) times larger than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is sufficient.
- **D) \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \) is smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is insufficient.

Thus, the only energy difference that satisfies the requirement is \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \).

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

Alternatively, maybe the individual uncertainties are enough that each line is broader than the other, so the separation just needs to be larger than the larger of the two. Hmm, I'm not sure. Let's proceed with the first idea, that ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Let me compute ΔE1 and ΔE2.

First, let's get the values:

τ1 = 1e-9 seconds = 1 ns

τ2 = 1e-8 seconds = 10 ns

Compute ΔE1 and ΔE2.

But wait, Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. So ħ = h/(2π) ≈ 1.05457e-34 J·s.

So ΔE1 = ħ/(2 τ1) = (1.05457e-34) / (2 * 1e-9) ) = (1.05457e-34) / (2e-9) ) = 5.27285e-26 J.

Wait, but we need to convert this into electron volts because the options are in eV.

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So to convert J to eV, divide by 1.602e-19.

ΔE1 (in eV) = (5.27285e-26 J) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ 3.29e-7 eV.

Wait, that's 3.29e-7 eV, which is 0.329 μeV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = ħ/(2 τ2) = (1.05457e-34) / (2e-8) ) = 1.05457e-34 / 2e-8 = 5.27285e-27 J.

Convert to eV: 5.27285e-27 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = 3.29e-8 eV.

So, ΔE1 ≈ 3.29e-7 eV, ΔE2 ≈ 3.29e-8 eV.

So the sum of ΔE1 and ΔE2 would be approximately 3.62e-7 eV.

So for the two energy levels to be distinguishable, the energy difference ΔE should be greater than 3.62e-7 eV. So looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 eV → 0.001 n eV? That's way smaller than 3.6e-7 eV. So no.

B) 1e-11 eV → 0.01e-9 eV → way too small.

C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV. That's 1e-4 eV, which is 1e4 times larger than 3.6e-7. So this is way bigger than the required.

D) 1e-8 eV → 0.00000001 eV. That's 1e-8 eV, which is about 0.03 times 3.6e-7 eV. So 1e-8 is smaller than 3.6e-7, so it's not enough.

Wait, but wait. Did I miscalculate the sum? Let me see:

3.29e-7 (ΔE1) plus 3.29e-8 (ΔE2) equals 3.619e-7 eV. So the energy difference has to be larger than that. So the only option that's larger is option C, 1e-4 eV.

So the correct answer should be option C.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the minimum required as the maximum of the two uncertainties. Because for each energy level, the other's uncertainty is smaller, so perhaps the main constraint is the larger one, which is ΔE1.

Wait, but the energy difference between the two states needs to be larger than the sum of their uncertainties, because if their uncertainties overlap, you can't distinguish them. But perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, think about the line widths. Each state has its own line width. The line width for E1 is about 2ΔE1, and for E2 it's 2ΔE2. So the separation between the two lines must be larger than the sum of their half-widths. Wait, but in reality, the lorentzian lines have a certain width, and the separation must be more than the sum of their half-widths to be resolvable. Because if the separation is less than the sum, the lines would overlap.

So the minimum separation required is when the separation is greater than the sum of their half-widths.

But in any case, the required energy difference is larger than 3.6e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV = 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 divided by 1e-7 is 1000 times larger. So that's way more than enough.

So the correct answer is option C.


To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish the two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the uncertainty in energy (\( \Delta E \)) to the uncertainty in time (\( \Delta t \)) as:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}.
\]

Here, the lifetimes (\( \tau \)) of the two states are given as \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \). Assuming \( \Delta t \approx \tau \), the minimum energy uncertainty for each state is:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{2\tau_1}, \quad \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{2\tau_2}.
\]

Using \( \hbar \approx 1.05457 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and converting the results to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{1.05457 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} \, \text{J} = 5.27285 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}, \quad \Delta E_1 \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{1.05457 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} \, \text{J} = 5.27285 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}, \quad \Delta E_2 \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference (\( \Delta E \)) must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} + 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \approx 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Now, evaluate the options:

- **A) \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \) is much smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is insufficient.
- **B) \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \) is also much smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is insufficient.
- **C) \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) is \( 10^3 \) times larger than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is sufficient.
- **D) \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \) is smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is insufficient.

Thus, the only energy difference that satisfies the requirement is \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \).

Answer: C
