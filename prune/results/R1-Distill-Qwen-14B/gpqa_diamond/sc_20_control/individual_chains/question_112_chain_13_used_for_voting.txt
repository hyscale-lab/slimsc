Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's read the problem again.

The problem says that there's a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i) |up> + (2 - i) |down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So I know that |up> and |down> form an orthonormal basis for the spin-1/2 system.

The first part asks to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator is given as A_ij, where A_ij is hbar/2 if i is not equal to j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, wait, that seems a bit confusing. So for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements are 0, and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2?

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The matrix A has elements A_ij = (hbar/2) if i != j, and 0 otherwise. So for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements (i = j) are 0, and the off-diagonal elements (i != j) are hbar/2. So the matrix would look like:
[ 0, hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2, 0 ]

Hmm, wait, no. Wait, in a 2x2 matrix, i and j can be 1 and 2, or 2 and 1. So when i=1 and j=2, it's hbar/2; i=2, j=1, same. Diagonal elements (1,1) and (2,2) are 0. So the matrix is:
[ 0, hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2, 0 ]

Wait, but that's for a 2x2 matrix. So what is this operator? Let's think about it. The standard spin matrices for S_x, S_y, S_z. For spin-1/2 particles, S_x is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix, which is [[0,1],[1,0]]. Similarly, S_y is (ħ/2)[[0,-i],[i,0]], and S_z is (ħ/2)[[1,0],[0,-1]].

So the matrix given here looks like (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix, which is S_x. So the operator in question is probably the spin-x operator, S_x.

Wait, but the problem says to find the eigenstates of this operator. So the eigenstates of S_x would be |+x> and |-x>, which are the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix.

So the state |alpha> is expressed in the z-basis. To find the probabilities of measuring in the x-basis, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the |+x> and |-x> states.

Alternatively, I can compute the overlap between |alpha> and each of the eigenstates of the operator (which is S_x). The square of the absolute value of these overlaps gives the probabilities.

Wait, but perhaps an easier way is to compute the components of |alpha> in the x-basis. So I need to find the projections of |alpha> onto |+x> and |-x>.

Alternatively, considering that |+x> and |-x> can be written in terms of the |up> and |down> states.

I remember that |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Or wait, is it (|up> + i|down>)/sqrt(2) or something else? Wait, no, the actual states are:

The eigenstates of S_x are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Or is it (|up> + i|down>)/sqrt(2)? Wait, no, I think I might have gotten that wrong. Let me think. The eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix (sigma_x) are (1,1)/sqrt(2) and (1,-1)/sqrt(2). So, in terms of |up> and |down>, which correspond to (1,0) and (0,1), the |+x> state is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, to find the probability of measuring the system in |+x> or |-x>, I need to compute the inner product of |alpha> with each of these states, take the absolute value squared, and that's the probability.

But first, I need to normalize |alpha> because it's given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>.

So let me write |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>.

The normalization factor is 1 over the square root of the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of each coefficient. So the norm is |1+i|^2 + |2 - i|^2.

Calculate each modulus squared:

|1 + i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

|2 - i|^2 = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5.

So the norm squared is 2 +5 =7. So the normalized state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So the coefficients are (1+i)/sqrt(7) for |up>, and (2 -i)/sqrt(7) for |down>.

Now, to find the probability of measuring in |+x> state, I need to compute the inner product between |alpha> and |+x>, then square its magnitude.

Similarly for |-x>.

So, let's compute:

First, write |+x> as (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

The inner product < +x | alpha > is (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| + <down| ] multiplied by [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down> ].

So the inner product is (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * 1 + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * 1 ].

Because <up|up> = 1, <down|down> =1, and cross terms are zero.

So putting it together:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i + 2 -i) ) / sqrt(7) ) ]

Simplify numerator inside the brackets: 1+i +2 -i = 3.

So this becomes (1/sqrt(2)) * (3 / sqrt(7)) ) = 3/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) ) = 3 / sqrt(14).

The probability is the square of the absolute value of this, which is (3^2)/(14) =9/14 ≈0.642857.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is around 0.64. Hmm, looking at the options, option A has 0.64 and 0.36 as probabilities, which sum to 1. So maybe that's a possibility.

But wait, let's check the other eigenstate.

Compute the inner product for |-x> which is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

< -x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| - <down| ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7) ]

So that's (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) *1 - (2 -i)/sqrt(7) *1 ].

Simplify numerator:

(1+i) - (2 -i) = 1 +i -2 +i = (-1) + 2i.

So the inner product is ( (-1 + 2i) ) / ( sqrt(2)*sqrt(7) ) → (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

The probability is the square of the absolute value: |(-1 + 2i)|^2 /14.

The numerator is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) =1 +4=5. So 5/14 ≈0.3571.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.6428 and 5/14≈0.3571.

Wait, but that's approximately 0.64 and 0.36, which matches option A's first two numbers.

But let's also calculate the average value of the operator. The operator in question is the one with matrix A_ij = 0 when i=j and hbar/2 otherwise. As we thought earlier, that's the spin-x operator, S_x.

The average value is <alpha| S_x |alpha>.

Since S_x is (ħ/2) sigma_x, which is (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]].

So the matrix representation is:

[ [0, ħ/2],
  [ħ/2, 0] ]

So, to compute <alpha| S_x |alpha>, we can use the expectation value formula.

Alternatively, because |alpha> is already expressed in the z-basis, perhaps it's easier to compute it using the components.

Another approach is to write |alpha> as a column vector, then compute the expectation value.

But perhaps a smarter way is to note that S_x has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, so the expectation value would be the sum over the probabilities multiplied by the eigenvalues.

Wait, but wait, the operator is S_x, which has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. The expectation value <S_x> is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

So, the expectation value is (probability of +x)(ħ/2) + (probability of -x)(-ħ/2).

Which is [ (9/14) * (ħ/2) ) ] + [ (5/14) * (-ħ/2) ) ].

Compute:

= (9 ħ/(14 * 2) ) - (5 ħ/(14 * 2) )
= (4 ħ/(28))
= (4 ħ)/(28) = ħ/7.

Hmm, so the average value is ħ/7. So that matches option A's third value, which is ħ/7.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is ħ/7. So option A says 0.64, 0.36, and ħ/7. So that would be option A.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my calculations for any possible mistake.

Wait, in the calculation of the inner product for |+x>:

I had |alpha> as [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

And |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

Inner product < +x | alpha > is [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(7)).

Wait, that's (1 +i +2 -i ) =3, so 3/(sqrt(14)).

Wait, but [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] is 3, correct. So the inner product is 3/sqrt(14), so the probability is 9/14, which is about 0.642857.

Similarly, for the |-x> inner product, I had:

(1+i) - (2 -i) = -1 + 2i. The absolute value squared is 1 +4=5, so 5/14, which is about 0.357.

So that's correct.

The average value calculation seems correct as well. So option A is 0.64, 0.36, and ħ/7. So that's the correct option.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36, hbar /7 → yes.

So the final answer should be A.

The problem involves calculating the probabilities of measuring an electron in the eigenstates of the operator with matrix representation \( A_{ij} \), where \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise. Additionally, the average value of this operator must be determined.

### Key Steps:

1. **State Normalization**:  
   The state \( |\alpha\rangle \) is given as proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). To normalize it, compute the norm:
   \[
   \| |\alpha\rangle \|^2 = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7.
   \]
   Thus, the normalized state is:
   \[
   |\alpha\rangle = \frac{(1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{7}}.
   \]

2. **Eigenstates of the Operator**:  
   The operator \( A_{ij} \) corresponds to the spin-\( x \) operator \( S_x \), whose eigenstates are:
   \[
   |+x\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}.
   \]

3. **Probabilities of Measuring in \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \)**:  
   The probability of measuring the system in \( |+x\rangle \) is given by:
   \[
   P(+x) = |\langle +x|\alpha\rangle|^2.
   \]
   Compute \( \langle +x|\alpha\rangle \):
   \[
   \langle +x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[ \langle\uparrow| + \langle\downarrow| \right] \frac{(1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{7}}.
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   \langle +x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left[ (1+i) + (2-i) \right] = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}.
   \]
   The probability is:
   \[
   P(+x) = \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64.
   \]

   Similarly, for \( |-x\rangle \):
   \[
   P(-x) = |\langle -x|\alpha\rangle|^2.
   \]
   Compute \( \langle -x|\alpha\rangle \):
   \[
   \langle -x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[ \langle\uparrow| - \langle\downarrow| \right] \frac{(1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{7}}.
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   \langle -x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left[ (1+i) - (2-i) \right] = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
   \]
   The probability is:
   \[
   P(-x) = \left| \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{(-1)^2 + (2)^2}{14} = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
   \]

4. **Average Value of the Operator**:  
   The operator \( A_{ij} \) corresponds to \( S_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli \( x \)-matrix. The expectation value is:
   \[
   \langle S_x \rangle = \langle \alpha | S_x | \alpha \rangle.
   \]
   Using the eigenvalues of \( S_x \), \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \), and the probabilities \( P(+x) = \frac{9}{14} \), \( P(-x) = \frac{5}{14} \):
   \[
   \langle S_x \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
   \]

### Final Answer:
The probabilities of measuring the particle in \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), respectively, and the average value of the operator is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). These results match **Option A**.
