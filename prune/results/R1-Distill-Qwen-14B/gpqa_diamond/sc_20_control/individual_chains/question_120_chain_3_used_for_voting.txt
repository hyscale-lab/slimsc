Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, it's a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

The question says that stars are uniformly distributed, so same number everywhere in space. But wait, parallax is involved here. Parallax is related to distance, right? The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Parallax (plx) is like the apparent shift in a star's position as seen from Earth over six months. The formula I remember is plx (in arcseconds) = 1 / distance (in parsecs). So, higher parallax means closer star.

The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx. So, like, if I have a certain range of plx values, how does the count of stars in each range vary?

Wait, I think this has to do with the distribution of stars in space. If stars are uniformly distributed, their number density is constant. So, the number should depend on the volume they occupy. But how does that relate to parallax?

Let me think about the volume in terms of distance. The number of stars in a thin shell between distance d and d + dd would be proportional to the surface area of the shell times the thickness dd. The surface area is 4πd², so the number of stars in that shell is 4πd² * (number density) * dd.

But wait, the question is about parallax. Parallax plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Let me substitute that into the expression. So, d = 1/plx, so dd would be - (1/plx²) d plx. Wait, the negative sign probably just indicates the direction of change as plx increases, but for counting stars, maybe I can ignore it for now.

So, substituting d = 1/plx into 4πd², we get 4π (1/plx²). Then, the number of stars is proportional to (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) d plx? Wait, that doesn't sound right.

Wait, wait, the number of stars in a shell is 4πd² * n * dd. Since n is uniform, it's 4πd² * n * dd. But we're looking at the number per unit plx. So, how does this change when we express it in terms of plx?

Let me try substitution. Let’s say plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Then, dd = - (1/plx²) d plx. Wait, because if plx increases, d decreases. So, when plx is small, d is large, and vice versa.

So, the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d is 4πd² * n * dd. But we need to express this in terms of plx. So, substitute d = 1/plx, and dd = - (1/plx²) d plx.

So, substituting:

Number of stars = 4π (1/plx²) * n * (-1/plx² d plx) )

Wait, but the negative sign just indicates the direction of change, so when plx increases, d decreases, so the shell is moving closer. For the sake of counting, maybe the negative can be considered as positive because we're dealing with absolute changes.

So ignoring the negative sign, the number of stars per unit plx is 4π n (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) d plx. Wait, no, let me see. Wait, the expression is 4πd² n * dd, which is 4π (1/plx²) n * ( -1/plx² d plx ). So, combining, it's 4π n (1/plx^4) d plx.

Wait, that gives the number of stars per unit plx as proportional to 1/plx^4. So, the number of stars in a range of plx (like from plx to plx + dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4 times dplx.

But wait, that seems really steep. Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, let's carefully go through the steps:

1. The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d is N = 4π d² n dd, where n is the number density.

2. We want to express this in terms of parallax plx, where plx = 1/d. So, d = 1/plx.

3. The differential change in d is dd = d(1/plx) = - (1/plx²) d plx.

4. Substitute d and dd into the original equation:

N = 4π (1/plx)^2 * n * (-1/plx²) d plx.

Simplify:

N = 4π n * (1/plx²) * (-1/plx²) d plx.

The negatives might just indicate direction; perhaps we can take the absolute value, so:

N ∝ (1/plx^4) d plx.

So, the number of stars per unit plx (i.e., per d plx) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of plx changes with plx. So, the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. That would mean that as plx increases (stars are farther away), the number per unit plx drops like 1 over plx to the fourth power.

Looking at the options, option A is ~ 1/plx^4. So, that's the one.

But wait, wait. I'm a bit confused because when you think about volume, the number of stars should depend on the volume, which increases with distance. But since we're looking at parallax (which is inverse distance), the number per unit plx would decrease as plx increases. So, higher parallax (closer stars) would have more stars in a given plx range.

Wait, for example, stars near us (high plx) are more densely packed in terms of plx. So, for a small range of plx (like 0.1 to 0.2 arcseconds), you have more stars than in a similar range at lower plx (like 1.0 to 1.1 arcseconds).

But according to my calculation, the number per unit plx goes as 1/plx^4. So, the higher the plx, the more stars per unit plx. That makes sense because nearby stars are more numerous in a given plx range.

Wait, but according to the math, the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So, if plx is small (close stars), 1/plx^4 is large, meaning more stars per unit plx.

So the number of stars per unit plx decreases as 1/plx^4, meaning it's inversely proportional to plx^4. So, as plx increases, the number per unit plx decreases.

Wait, no, wait: If plx increases, 1/plx^4 decreases. So, higher plx (closer stars) would have higher number of stars per unit plx. But wait the question is phrased: "how the number of stars per unit range of plx changes with plx?" So, as plx increases, the number per unit range changes.

Wait, the number per unit plx is N ∝ 1/plx^4. So, if plx increases, N decreases. So, the number of stars per unit range of plx decreases as plx increases.

But wait, let's think about the actual numbers. Suppose plx is 1, then 1/(1)^4 is 1. If plx is 2, 1/(2^4)=1/16, which is much less. So yes, as plx increases, the number per unit plx decreases.

So the correct option is A) ~1/plx^4.

Wait, but I thought I might have made a mistake here. Let me think of another way. Alternatively, the number of stars in a given volume increases with the volume. But since we're looking at a shell at distance d (parallax plx), and the volume depends on d² (because it's a spherical shell), and the number of stars in that shell is 4πd² * n * dd. But when we express it in terms of plx, we have to change variables.

So, another approach: the number per unit plx is dN/dplx. So,

dN = 4π d² n dd.

We can write dd in terms of d plx. So, plx = 1/d, so d plx = - (1/d²) dd → dd = - d² d plx.

Substituting into dN:

dN = 4π d² n ( - d² d plx ).

But since d = 1/plx,

dN = 4π (1/plx²) n ( - (1/plx^2 ) d plx )

Again, ignoring the negative sign,

dN = 4π n (1/plx^4 ) d plx.

So, dN/dplx = 4π n (1/plx^4 ). So, the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So, option A is correct.

Wait, but wait, another thought: when you plot the number of stars against parallax, I think I've heard that the number per unit plx decreases with plx, but the exact dependence is something like 1/(plx^3) or 1/(plx^2). Hmm, maybe I should think about the solid angle and flux, but no, the question is about number per unit plx.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, let me think of it as a volume. The volume between parallax plx and plx + dplx is the volume between distances d and d + dd, where d = 1/plx.

The volume of a spherical shell is 4/3 π ( (d + dd)^3 - d^3 ). For small dd, this approximates to 4π d² dd.

But when you express it in terms of plx, since d = 1/plx, dd = - (1/plx^2) d plx.

So the volume element is 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - 1/plx^2 d plx ). But the number of stars is proportional to this volume, so number of stars dN = 4π (1/plx²) (1/plx²) d plx * n.

So, dN ∝ (1/plx^4) d plx.

Therefore, the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So, the correct answer is A.

But I'm a bit uncertain because sometimes I might mix up the exponents. Let me check:

If the number per unit plx is 1/plx^4, then as plx increases, the number decreases rapidly. But I recall that in reality, if you have a uniform distribution of stars, the number should drop off with the square of distance, or something else. Hmm.

Wait, let me think in terms of distance. The number of stars per unit distance (d) would be 4π d² n, which is proportional to d². So, as d increases, number per unit d increases as d². But parallax plx is 1/d, so when plx decreases, d increases.

So, number per unit plx is more when plx is small (d is large), so it's 1/plx^4.

Alternatively, I can think of plx as a variable, so how does the distribution look? Maybe if I plot number per plx bin versus plx, it should follow 1/plx^4.

Wait, another approach: the differential number of stars per unit parallax is dN/dplx. From earlier, we have dN/dplx = 4π n (1/plx^4 ). So, the number per unit plx depends on 1/plx^4.

So, the answer should be option A.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely related to distance: 

\[
\text{plx} = \frac{1}{d}, \quad \text{where } d \text{ is the distance in parsecs}.
\]

The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \(d\) is proportional to the surface area of the shell and the thickness \(dd\): 

\[
dN = 4\pi d^2 n \, dd,
\]

where \(n\) is the uniform number density of stars. Substituting \(d = 1/\text{plx}\) and \(dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\) (from the relationship between \(dd\) and \(d\text{plx}\)), we get:

\[
dN = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2}\right) n \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right).
\]

Simplifying, the negative sign indicates the direction of change, but for counting stars, we focus on the magnitude:

\[
dN \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to \(1/\text{plx}^4\). This means that as parallax increases (stars are closer), the number of stars per unit parallax range decreases steeply.

From the options provided:

- **A) ~ \(1/\text{plx}^4\):** Matches the derived relationship.
- **B) ~ \(1/\text{plx}^2\):** Incorrect, as the dependence is stronger.
- **C) ~ \(1/\text{plx}^1\):** Incorrect, as the dependence is even stronger.
- **D) ~ \(1/\text{plx}^3\):** Incorrect, as the correct dependence is \(1/\text{plx}^4\).

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
