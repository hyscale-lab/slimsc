Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, specifically how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I need to think through this carefully. Let's see what I remember from my astronomy classes.

Parallax is a measure of how much a star appears to shift its position in the sky relative to background stars as the Earth orbits the Sun. The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So a star with a larger parallax is actually closer. Oh right, because the closer it is, the bigger the shift you see. So parallax (p) is equal to 1 over distance (d) in parsecs. So p = 1/d.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So maybe it's about how the density of stars changes with parallax. Or perhaps it's the number of stars observed in a given range of parallaxes.

Wait, if stars are uniformly distributed, that probably means their actual density in space is uniform. But when observed, their distribution in terms of parallax might not look uniform because of the way parallax relates to distance.

Let me think: if the number of stars is uniform in space, the number per unit volume is constant. So, say the number density is n (stars per cubic parsec). Then, the number of stars within a certain volume would be n times that volume.

But how does that translate to parallax? Let's think about a thin spherical shell at a distance d. The volume of a shell with radius d and thickness dd is approximately 4πd² dd. So the number of stars in that shell would be n * 4πd² dd.

But parallax p is 1/d. So d = 1/p. Let's substitute that. The number of stars in a shell at parallax p is n * 4π (1/p)^2 * ( - dp / p² ). Wait, because dd would be in terms of d, but since p is 1/d, when d changes by a small amount, say dd, p changes by dp = - (1/d²) dd. So dd = - d² dp. Hmm, maybe I can express the number of stars in terms of p.

Let me try that again. The volume of a shell is 4πd² dd. So the number of stars in that shell is n * 4πd² dd. Now, since p = 1/d, d = 1/p, so dd = - (1/p²) dp. Wait, because if p increases, d decreases. So if I have a small change dp in p, the change in d is dd = - (1/p²) dp.

Substituting into the number of stars: n *4π (1/p)^2 * ( - (1/p²) dp ). Wait, the negative sign just indicates direction, so when considering the number per unit parallax, maybe I can ignore it for the sake of magnitude. So the number becomes n *4π * (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp. Wait, no, wait another moment. Let me double-check.

Wait, the number in a shell is n *4πd² dd. But since we're considering how many stars are in a range of parallax dp, let's express this in terms of p. So, d = 1/p, so d squared is 1/p². And the thickness of the shell in terms of d is dd, which is (1/p^2) dp. So the number of stars is n *4π (1/p^2) * (1/p^2) dp.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The number in the shell is n *4π d^2 dd. So substituting d = 1/p, that becomes n *4π (1/p)^2 * (dd). But dd = (1/p^2) dp. So substituting that, we get n *4π (1/p^2) * (1/p^2) dp. So that's n *4π (1/p^4) dp. So the number of stars per unit parallax (dp) is proportional to 1/p^4.

Wait, but the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. So if we take a small range of parallax dp, the number of stars in that range would be around 1/p^4 times some constant.

But wait, I'm being asked about how the number changes with plx. So the number of stars per unit range (like per unit plx) is roughly proportional to 1/(plx)^4. Looking at the options, option A is 1/(plx)^4.

But wait, wait a moment. Let me make sure. Because when you have a parallax range, you're integrating across all distances. So maybe I should think about the differential number of stars per unit parallax.

Wait, another approach. Suppose stars are uniformly distributed in space, density n per volume. Consider a thin slice of space at distance d with thickness dd. The number of stars in that slice is n * 4πd² dd. Now, since parallax p is 1/d, so dp = - (1/d²) dd → dd = -d² dp. Substituting d = 1/p, so d² = 1/p². So dd = - (1/p²) dp.

So the number in the slice is n *4π (1/p)^2 * ( -1/p² dp ). Ignoring the negative, the number is n *4π (1/p^4) dp. So the number per unit parallax is n *4π / p^4.

So the number of stars per unit range of parallax (dp) is proportional to 1/p^4. So the answer should be option A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I initially thought it might be option D (1/p^3), but my calculation here suggests 1/p^4. Let me see where I might have gone wrong.

Wait, perhaps I confused the number per unit parallax. Let me think about it again. The number of stars in a shell is proportional to the surface area (4πd²) times the thickness in distance (dd). So that's 4πd² dd. Since p = 1/d, so d = 1/p → dd = - (1/p²) dp.

Substituting, 4π*(1/p)^2 * (-1/p^2 dp) = 4π (1/p^4) dp. So the number of stars per unit parallax (dp) is proportional to 1/p^4.

So that would be option A: ~1/plx^4.

Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because I remember something about flux or something else. Wait, perhaps I should think about the differential number of stars as a function of distance, and how that translates to parallax.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the cumulative number of stars up to a certain parallax and then take the derivative. But that might complicate things.

Wait, another way: since the number of stars in a volume element dV is n dV. And dV for a thin shell is 4πd² dd. So N = n *4πd² dd. So the number per unit distance is N/(dd) =4π n d². Now, since p =1/d, d = 1/p. So d² is 1/p². So N/(dd) =4π n (1/p²). Now, to find the number per unit parallax, we have to find N/(dp), so we can relate dd and dp.

We know that dp = -1/(d^2) dd → dd = -d^2 dp = -1/p^2 dp.

So N/(dp) = (N/(dd)) * (dd/dp) = (4π n (1/p²)) * ( -1/p² ) ) = 4π n (-1/p^4). The negative indicates decreasing as p increases, but the magnitude is 4π n / p^4. So the number per unit parallax is proportional to 1/p^4.

So the correct option would be A) ~1/plx^4.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by analyzing the relationship between parallax and distance. Parallax \( p \) is inversely proportional to distance \( d \), such that \( p = \frac{1}{d} \). Assuming stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number density of stars is constant, denoted as \( n \) (stars per cubic parsec).

The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is given by \( N = n \cdot 4\pi d^2 dd \), where \( 4\pi d^2 dd \) is the volume of the shell. To express this in terms of parallax, we substitute \( d = \frac{1}{p} \), so \( d^2 = \frac{1}{p^2} \), and \( dd = -\frac{1}{p^2} dp \) (since \( p = \frac{1}{d} \), a small change \( dp \) in \( p \) corresponds to \( dd = -\frac{1}{p^2} dp \)).

Substituting these into the expression for \( N \), we get:

\[
N = n \cdot 4\pi \cdot \frac{1}{p^2} \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{p^2} dp\right) = n \cdot 4\pi \cdot \frac{1}{p^4} dp.
\]

The negative sign indicates the direction of change, but for the purpose of magnitude, we focus on \( \frac{1}{p^4} \). Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax \( dp \) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{p^4} \).

This means the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{p^4} \), corresponding to option A.
