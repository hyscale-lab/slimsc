Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electrons and positrons annihilating into photons. Hmm, I need to figure out the angle between the two photons after the collision. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, let's start by understanding what's happening. So, there's an electron moving to the right (from the left) with a Lorentz factor of 4. Then there's a positron moving to the left (from the right) with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons.

Wait, electrons and positrons are matter and antimatter, right? So when they meet, they annihilate each other, and their mass is converted into energy—photons in this case. Since both particles are moving, their kinetic energies and directions must be considered.

The problem states that both photons have the same energy, and one is going upper-right while the other is lower-right. So their directions are symmetric in some way, maybe making the same angle with the horizontal but in opposite vertical directions.

I remember that in such annihilations, momentum must be conserved. So the total momentum before the collision should equal the total after. Since the particles are moving in opposite directions along the same axis, their momenta would add up vectorially.

Wait, but wait—since it's an electron and a positron, their rest masses are the same, but their velocities and gamma factors are different. So I need to calculate their relativistic momenta.

The Lorentz factor gamma is given as 4 for the electron and 2 for the positron.

The relativistic momentum p is gamma multiplied by m times v. But since gamma is given, maybe it's easier to use p = gamma * m0 * v, but I also know that gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Alternatively, for momentum, the formula can be expressed as p = gamma * m0 * c² / (c²/(v²))). Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of beta and gamma.

Wait, beta is v/c. So for the electron, gamma_e = 4, and for the positron, gamma_p = 2.

The momentum of each particle would be p = gamma * m0 * beta * c. Because in natural units where c=1, it's gamma*m0*beta.

Wait, but wait—since the positron is moving in the opposite direction, its momentum would be negative if we consider the electron's direction as positive.

So, let's assign the electron's direction as positive. The positron's momentum is to the left, so it's negative.

So, the total momentum before collision is p_electron + p_positron.

But wait, the positron's momentum is in the opposite direction. So, let's see:

p_e = gamma_e * m0 * beta_e
p_p = gamma_p * m0 * beta_p * (-1) [since direction is opposite]

So, p_total = p_e - p_p?

Wait, but wait—I need to calculate beta for each particle. Because gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta²), so beta can be found from gamma.

Let me compute beta_e and beta_p.

For the electron (gamma_e =4):
gamma_e =4 = 1/sqrt(1 - beta_e²)
=> 1 - beta_e² = 1/(gamma_e)^2 = 1/16
=> beta_e² = 1 - 1/16 = 15/16
=> beta_e = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.9682 c.

Similarly, for the positron (gamma_p=2):
gamma_p=2 =1/sqrt(1 - beta_p²)
=> 1 - beta_p² = 1/4
=> beta_p²=3/4
=> beta_p = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660 c.

So the electron's momentum is p_e = gamma_e * m0 * beta_e
Similarly, the positron's momentum is p_p = gamma_p * m0 * beta_p, but since it's moving opposite, it's -gamma_p * m0 * beta_p.

Wait, but wait a second—wait, the positron has the same mass as the electron, m0 is the rest mass. So yes, same m0.

So, putting it all together:

p_e = 4 * m0 * (sqrt(15)/4) = m0 * sqrt(15)
p_p = 2 * m0 * (sqrt(3)/2) = m0 * sqrt(3)
But since the positron is moving in the opposite direction, its momentum is -m0 * sqrt(3).

So total momentum before collision is p_total = p_e + p_p = m0 (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Wait, but wait—is that correct? Because the positron's direction is opposite, so the momentum should be subtracted. So, if the electron is moving right (positive direction), and the positron left (negative), then the total momentum is p_e - p_p.

Wait, no. The positron's momentum is in the negative direction. So p_p is negative. So p_total = p_e + p_p = m0 (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me rephrase. The positron's momentum is in the opposite direction, so its momentum relative to the electron's direction is negative. So:

p_e = 4 * m0 * beta_e = 4 * m0 * (sqrt(15)/4) = m0 * sqrt(15)
p_p = 2 * m0 * beta_p * (-1) = -2 * m0 * (sqrt(3)/2) = -m0 * sqrt(3)

So p_total = p_e + p_p = m0 (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

So that's the total momentum before the collision.

Now, after the collision, two photons are emitted with the same energy. But the problem says the photons have the same energy. So each photon's energy is E_photon = (gamma_e + gamma_p) * m0 c²? Wait, no, because the rest mass energy is m0 c² each. So the total energy before collision is (gamma_e + gamma_p) m0 c².

Wait, the electron has energy E_e = gamma_e * m0 c², and the positron has E_p = gamma_p * m0 c². So total energy is E_total = (gamma_e + gamma_p) m0 c².

After annihilation, the two photons must carry away this total energy. So each photon's energy is (gamma_e + gamma_p)/2 * m0 c². But wait, the problem says both photons have the same energy. So they each have E_photon = (gamma_e + gamma_p) m0 c² / 2.

Wait, but wait, let me compute that. gamma_e is 4, gamma_p is 2. So E_photon = (4+2)/2 * m0 c² = 3 m0 c² each.

Wait, but wait—no, because the rest mass energy is m0 c² for each particle, so the total rest mass energy is 2 m0 c². But because they're moving, their total energy is (gamma_e + gamma_p) m0 c², which is more than 2 m0 c². So when they annihilate, the photons carry away more energy than just the rest mass. So each photon's energy is (gamma_e + gamma_p) m0 c² / 2.

Wait, but in the question, the photons have the same energy, so that's correct.

But wait, I'm a bit confused about the energy conservation here. Because the total energy before collision is the sum of the relativistic energies of the electron and positron. So yes, that's correct.

Now, the photons' momenta must add up to the total momentum before collision, and their energies sum to the total energy before.

But each photon's momentum is p = E/c, and since they're photons, their momentum direction is the same as their direction of motion.

Wait, the first photon is moving upper-right, so its momentum has both x and y components. The second is moving lower-right, so also x and y, but opposite in y.

Hmm, because both photons are moving in the right direction, but one is upwards and the other downwards.

Wait, but the problem says one is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. So both have positive x-components, but opposite y-components.

So, let me model this.

Let me denote photon 1 as moving in the direction making an angle theta above the x-axis, and photon 2 making the same angle theta below the x-axis. So their angles are theta and -theta, respectively.

Since their energies are the same, E1 = E2 = E.

The momentum vectors for each photon are:

p1 = (E/c) (cos(theta), sin(theta))
p2 = (E/c) (cos(theta), -sin(theta))

Because the second photon is moving at angle -theta.

The total momentum of the photons is p1 + p2 = (E/c) [ (cos(theta) + cos(theta)), (sin(theta) - sin(theta)) ) ] = (E/c) (2 cos(theta), 0)

So the total momentum in the y-direction is zero, which makes sense due to symmetry.

In the x-direction, the total momentum is (2 E cos(theta) ) / c.

But from before, the total momentum before collision was p_total = m0 (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

So equate the x-components:

(2 E cos(theta) ) / c = m0 (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

But I also know that E is the energy of each photon, which is (gamma_e + gamma_p) m0 c² / 2.

Wait, let me compute E first.

gamma_e =4, gamma_p=2.

E_photon = (4 + 2) * m0 c² / 2 = 6 m0 c² /2 = 3 m0 c².

So E = 3 m0 c².

Now, substitute back into the momentum equation:

(2 * 3 m0 c² * cos(theta) ) / c = m0 (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))

Simplify the left side:

(6 m0 c² cos(theta)) / c = 6 m0 c cos(theta)

So 6 m0 c cos(theta) = m0 ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) )

Divide both sides by m0:

6 c cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)

Wait, but wait—I think I made a mistake here. Because the momentum of the photons is E/c, not E. Oh wait, no: photon momentum is E/c in magnitude. So the total x-component is (2 E/c) cos(theta) = m0 (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Wait, no, wait. The total x-momentum from the photons is (E/c) (2 cos(theta)), right? Because each photon contributes (E/c) cos(theta) in x. So 2*(E/c) cos(theta) = m0 (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

But E is 3 m0 c², so substituting:

2 * (3 m0 c²) / c * cos(theta) = m0 (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))

Simplify:

2 * 3 m0 c * cos(theta) = m0 (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))

The m0 cancels:

6 c cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)

Wait, but wait—this can't be right. Because sqrt(15) is about 3.872 and sqrt(3) is about 1.732, so sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈ 2.14. 6c is a huge number, but the right side is about 2.14 * m0. Hmm, I think I'm making a mistake in units somewhere.

Wait, let's re-express the equation correctly.

The total momentum before collision is p_total = m0 (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Wait, but wait, the units don't add up. Because the momentum of the electron is gamma_e * m0 * beta_e c. Because p = gamma m v = gamma m (beta c) = gamma m0 beta c.

So for the electron, p_e = 4 * m0 * (sqrt(15)/4) c = m0 sqrt(15) c.

Similarly, the positron's momentum is 2 * m0 * (sqrt(3)/2) c = m0 sqrt(3) c. But since it's moving in the opposite direction, p_p = - m0 sqrt(3) c.

So total momentum p_total = p_e + p_p = m0 sqrt(15) c - m0 sqrt(3) c = m0 c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

So now, the momentum from the photons is p_total_photon = (sum of their momenta) = (E1/c) direction + (E2/c) direction.

But each photon's momentum is E/c, so:

p_total_photon_x = (E1/c) cos(theta1) + (E2/c) cos(theta2)

Since both photons have same energy E_photon = E, and their angles are theta and -theta, as I thought earlier, then:

theta1 = theta (upper-right) and theta2 = -theta (lower-right).

So cos(theta2) = cos(theta), since cos(-theta)=cos(theta). The x-component for each is E/c * cos(theta), so total x momentum is 2 E cos(theta)/c.

But E is 3 m0 c², as before.

So 2 * 3 m0 c² * cos(theta) / c = m0 c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Simplify the left side:

(6 m0 c² cos(theta)) / c = 6 m0 c cos(theta).

Set equal to right side:

6 m0 c cos(theta) = m0 c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Divide both sides by m0 c:

6 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).

Compute sqrt(15) ≈ 3.872, sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732. So sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈ 2.14.

So 6 cos(theta) ≈ 2.14 → cos(theta) ≈ 2.14 /6 ≈ 0.3567.

Then theta = arccos(0.3567) ≈ 69 degrees.

Wait, but that's the angle each photon makes with the x-axis. So the angle between the two photons would be 2 theta, right? Because one is at +theta and the other at -theta, so the angle between them is 2 theta.

So 2 * 69 ≈ 138 degrees. But wait, looking at the options, option C is 138. So is that the answer?

Wait, but wait. Let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, let me compute 6 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).

Compute sqrt(15) is approximately 3.872983, sqrt(3) is approximately 1.73205. So 3.872983 - 1.73205 ≈ 2.14093.

So 6 cos(theta) = 2.14093 → cos(theta) ≈ 2.14093 /6 ≈ 0.35682.

So theta ≈ arccos(0.35682) ≈ 69 degrees, as before.

So the angle between the photons is 2 theta ≈ 138 degrees.

Looking at the options, option C is 138.

But wait, another approach: maybe the angle between them is 180 - 2 theta? No, because each is at theta from the x-axis in opposite directions, so the angle between them is 2 theta. For example, if theta is 60, the angle between is 120.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the angle between the two vectors.

Each photon's direction is theta above and below the x-axis. So the angle between them is theta + theta = 2 theta.

So yes, 138 degrees.

Wait, but wait—another point: when the two photons are emitted, their directions are symmetric with respect to the x-axis. So the angle between them is 2 theta. So 138 degrees, which is option C.

But the options are:

A) 74

B) 172

C) 138

D) 96

So option C) 138 is the correct answer.

Wait, but wait a second—what if I made a mistake in considering the directions of the particles?

Wait, the electron is moving to the right (positive x) and the positron to the left (negative x). So their momenta are p_e = m0 c (sqrt(15)) and p_p = - m0 c (sqrt(3)). So p_total = m0 c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Then, the photons' total momentum must equal that.

Each photon has E = 3 m0 c², so each has momentum E/c = 3 m0 c² / c = 3 m0 c.

So the total momentum from the photons is:

p_photon_x = (3 m0 c) cos(theta) + (3 m0 c) cos(theta) ) = 6 m0 c cos(theta).

Because both have the same cos(theta) as they are symmetric.

Set equal to p_total_x = m0 c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)):

6 m0 c cos(theta) = m0 c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Cancel m0 c:

6 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).

Which brings us back to the same equation, leading to theta ≈ 69 degrees, angle between 138.

So the answer is C) 138 degrees.

To solve the problem, we analyze the collision of an electron and a positron, which annihilate to produce two photons. The goal is to determine the angle between the directions of the photons.

### Key Information:
1. **Electron**: Moving to the right with a Lorentz factor \( \gamma_e = 4 \).
2. **Positron**: Moving to the left with a Lorentz factor \( \gamma_p = 2 \).
3. **Photon Energies**: Both photons have the same energy, \( E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{(\gamma_e + \gamma_p)}{2} m_0 c^2 = 3 m_0 c^2 \).
4. **Photon Directions**: One photon moves upper-right, and the other moves lower-right, symmetric with respect to the x-axis.

### Conservation of Momentum:
- **Relativistic Momentum**: The momentum of a particle is \( p = \gamma m_0 \beta c \), where \( \beta = v/c \).
- **Electron Momentum**: \( p_e = \gamma_e m_0 \beta_e c = 4 m_0 \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4} c = m_0 \sqrt{15} c \).
- **Positron Momentum**: \( p_p = \gamma_p m_0 \beta_p c = 2 m_0 \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} c = m_0 \sqrt{3} c \), but since it moves left, \( p_p = -m_0 \sqrt{3} c \).
- **Total Momentum Before Collision**: \( p_{\text{total}} = p_e + p_p = m_0 c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}) \).

### Photon Momentum:
- Each photon has energy \( E_{\text{photon}} = 3 m_0 c^2 \), so its momentum magnitude is \( p_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{photon}}}{c} = 3 m_0 c \).
- Let the photons make angles \( \theta \) and \( -\theta \) with the x-axis. Their momentum components are:
  - Photon 1: \( p_1 = 3 m_0 c (\cos\theta, \sin\theta) \),
  - Photon 2: \( p_2 = 3 m_0 c (\cos\theta, -\sin\theta) \).
- Total photon momentum: \( p_{\text{total, photons}} = p_1 + p_2 = (6 m_0 c \cos\theta, 0) \).

### Equating Total Momentum:
- The total momentum before and after the collision must be equal:
  \[
  6 m_0 c \cos\theta = m_0 c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}).
  \]
- Simplify:
  \[
  6 \cos\theta = \sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}.
  \]
- Compute \( \sqrt{15} \approx 3.872 \) and \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \), so:
  \[
  \sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3} \approx 2.14.
  \]
  \[
  6 \cos\theta = 2.14 \implies \cos\theta \approx \frac{2.14}{6} \approx 0.357.
  \]
- Solve for \( \theta \):
  \[
  \theta \approx \arccos(0.357) \approx 69^\circ.
  \]

### Angle Between Photons:
- The photons are symmetrically emitted at \( \theta \) and \( -\theta \) relative to the x-axis. The angle between them is:
  \[
  \phi = 2\theta \approx 2 \times 69^\circ = 138^\circ.
  \]

### Final Answer:
The angle between the directions of the photons is **138 degrees**.
