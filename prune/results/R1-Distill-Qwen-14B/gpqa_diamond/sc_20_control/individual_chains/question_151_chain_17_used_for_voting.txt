Okay, so I've got this problem here about quantum mechanics, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question says that the state of a system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, I think in quantum mechanics, the state of a system is usually represented by a vector in a Hilbert space, and it's a unit vector because the probabilities have to add up to 1. But wait, the vector given is (-1, 2, 1). Let me check: the length squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. Oh wait, so the length is sqrt(6). That means the state vector isn't normalized. I think in quantum mechanics, the state vectors must be normalized. So maybe I should normalize it first before doing anything else.

So, to normalize the state vector ψ, we need to divide it by its norm. The norm is sqrt(6), so the normalized state would be (1/sqrt(6))*(-1, 2, 1). So the state ψ is a column vector with each component multiplied by 1/sqrt(6).

Next, the observable is represented by the matrix P. Let me write down matrix P. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Wait, that's a 3x3 matrix. So this is a Hermitian matrix because, looking at the elements, they seem to be symmetric across the diagonal. Observables are represented by Hermitian matrices, so that makes sense.

The question is asking for the probability of measuring 0 when we measure the observable P. So I remember that when you measure an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the operator P. So first, I need to find the eigenvalues of P.

Wait, but maybe I can find the eigenvalues by looking for the values of λ such that det(P - λ I) = 0. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the eigenvalues by looking for patterns in the matrix.

Let me write down matrix P:

Row 1: 0     1/√2    0
Row 2: 1/√2  0     1/√2
Row 3: 0     1/√2    0

Hmm. So the matrix is symmetric, so Hermitian, which is good. Let me try to see if I can find its eigenvalues. Another approach is to note that this matrix might have some symmetry that allows for easier calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps look for eigenvectors. Let's consider the structure. The first and third rows are symmetric in a way, so maybe there's an eigenvector with certain properties.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find the eigenvalues by considering that the matrix can be written as a sum of tensor products or considering that it's a combination of simpler matrices. Alternatively, perhaps it's a tridiagonal matrix, which might help in computing eigenvalues.

Alternatively, another approach is to note that the matrix P might have rank 2 or something, but that's not obvious to me. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the characteristic equation.

The characteristic equation is the determinant of (P - λ I) equals zero. So let's write that out.

The matrix (P - λ I) is:

-λ      1/√2       0
1/√2   -λ        1/√2
0       1/√2     -λ

Hmm. Computing the determinant of a 3x3 matrix. The determinant for a 3x3 matrix can be done using the rule of Sarrus or expansion by minors. Let's try expansion.

The determinant is:

-λ * [(-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2)] - (1/√2) [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] + 0 [ something ].

Wait, wait, perhaps I'll expand along the first row.

So the determinant is:

(-λ) * det( [ [-λ, 1/√2], [1/√2, -λ] ] )
- (1/√2) * det( [ [1/√2, 1/√2], [0, -λ] ] )
+ 0 * det(...)

So let's compute each minor.

First term: (-λ) * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] = (-λ) [ λ² - (1/2) ]

Second term: - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ] = - (1/√2) [ (-λ/√2) ) ] = - (1/√2)* (-λ/√2) ) = (λ) / (2) )

Third term is zero.

So the determinant is:

(-λ)(λ² - 1/2 ) + (λ/2) ) 

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake in the signs. Wait, the cofactor for the second element (1/√2) is in position (1,2), which is even (since 1+2=3, which is odd), so the sign is (-1)^(1+2) = (-1)^3 = -1. So the second term should have a negative sign, but in the expansion, it's already subtracted, so perhaps I'm a bit confused.

Wait, no, the expansion for the first row would be:

sum over j: (-1)^(i+j) * a_ij * det(minor).

So for the first row (i=1), j runs from 1 to 3.

So:

= (-1)^(1+1) * a_11 * M_11 + (-1)^(1+2) * a_12 * M_12 + (-1)^(1+3) * a_13 * M_13

Where M_1j are minors.

So for j=1: a_11 is (-λ), M_11 is the determinant of the submatrix without row 1, column 1. So M_11 is:

| -λ    1/√2 |
| 1/√2  -λ   |

Which is (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) = λ² - 1/2.

So term 1: (+1) * (-λ) * (λ² - 1/2) = (-λ)(λ² -1/2)

For j=2: a_12 is (1/√2), M_12 is the determinant of the matrix without row 1, column 2:

Row 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3:

| 1/√2   1/√2 |
| 0      -λ   |

Which is (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) = -λ/(√2).

Term 2: (-1)^(3) * (1/√2) * (-λ/√2) ) 
= (-1) * (1/√2) * (-λ/√2)
= (-1) * (-λ/(2)) 
= λ/2.

For j=3: a_13 is 0, so term is 0.

So total determinant is:

(-λ)(λ² - 1/2) + (λ/2) )

Wait, but wait, the determinant is equal to the sum of the terms for each j. So:

det = (-λ)(λ² - 1/2) + (λ/2) + 0.

Let me expand that:

= (-λ^3 + (λ)(1/2)) + (λ/2)

= -λ^3 + (λ/2 + λ/2) )

= -λ^3 + λ.

So the characteristic equation is:

-λ^3 + λ = 0

Factor that:

λ(-λ² +1) = 0

Wait, no, wait: -λ^3 + λ = 0 → λ ( -λ² +1 ) = 0 → λ (1 - λ² ) = 0.

So the roots are λ = 0, and λ^2 =1 → λ=1 and λ=-1.

So the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, and -1.

Wait, but wait, we have a 3x3 matrix, so three eigenvalues. So that gives us 0, 1, -1.

So the possible outcomes of measuring P are 0, 1, and -1.

The question is asking for the probability of getting 0 when measuring P.

In quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue (here, 0) is the square of the absolute value of the amplitude of the component of the state vector in the corresponding eigenvector.

But wait, to find that, I need to find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to each eigenvalue.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: the matrix P has eigenvalues 0, 1, and -1. So the eigenspace for eigenvalue 0 is the set of vectors that P sends to zero. So maybe I can find a basis for that eigenspace.

Alternatively, perhaps the state vector can be expressed as a linear combination of the eigenvectors of P. Then, the probability of getting 0 is the square of the coefficient of the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

So first, let's find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.

Starting with eigenvalue λ=0.

We solve (P - 0 I ) v = 0 → P v = 0.

So the system is:

Row 1: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 +0*v3 = 0 → (1/√2) v2 = 0 → v2=0.

Row 2: (1/√2) v1 +0*v2 + (1/√2) v3 =0 → (1/√2)(v1 + v3 )=0 → v1 + v3 = 0 → v3= -v1.

Row 3: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 +0*v3 = 0 → v2=0.

So from row 1 and 3, v2=0.

From row 2, v3= -v1.

So the eigenvectors for λ=0 are of the form v1*(1, 0, -1). Because v2=0 and v3= -v1.

So an eigenvector could be (1, 0, -1). Let me check:

P * (1, 0, -1) = ?

Row 1: 0*1 + (1/√2)*0 +0*(-1) = 0 → correct for first component.

Row 2: (1/√2)*1 + 0*0 + (1/√2)*(-1) → (1/√2 - 1/√2)=0 → correct.

Row3: 0*1 + (1/√2)*0 +0*(-1)=0 → correct.

So yes, that's an eigenvector for λ=0.

Wait, but this is a 3x3 matrix, so each eigenvector is 3-dimensional. So the eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by (1, 0, -1). Because when v2=0 and v3=-v1, the eigenvector can be written as (v1, 0, -v1) = v1*(1,0,-1). So any scalar multiple.

Now, the state vector is ψ = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T, but normalized. So the normalized ψ is (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1, 2, 1) = ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )

We can express ψ as a linear combination of the eigenvectors of P. Let's say the eigenvectors are e0, e1, e-1, corresponding to eigenvalues 0, 1, -1, respectively.

So ψ = a e0 + b e1 + c e-1.

The probability of measuring 0 is |a|^2, the coefficient of e0 squared.

But to find a, we need to find the projection of ψ onto e0.

Wait, but wait. Are eigenvectors orthogonal? In general, eigenvectors from different eigenvalues are orthogonal, but for the same eigenvalue, they might not be unless the matrix is diagonalizable in a particular way.

But perhaps in this case, since we have three distinct eigenvalues (0,1,-1), each eigenspace is one-dimensional, and the eigenvectors are orthogonal.

Wait, let me check: Let's take the eigenvector for λ=1 and see if it's orthogonal to e0.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find all eigenvectors and then normalize them, then compute the inner product.

Wait, but maybe I should find the eigenvectors for each λ.

Let me proceed.

Eigenvalue λ=1:

We solve (P - I) v =0.

Matrix P-I:

-1   1/√2   0
1/√2 -1    1/√2
0    1/√2  -1

So the system is:

-1*v1 + (1/√2) v2 +0*v3 =0 → -v1 + (1/√2) v2 =0 → v1 = (1/√2) v2.

Row 2: (1/√2) v1 - v2 + (1/√2) v3 =0 → (1/√2) v1 = v2 - (1/√2) v3.

But from row 1, v1 = (1/√2) v2. Substitute into row 2:

(1/√2) * (1/√2 v2 ) - v2 + (1/√2) v3 =0 → (1/2) v2 - v2 + (1/√2) v3 =0 → (-1/2 v2) + (1/√2 v3) =0 → (1/√2) v3 = (1/2) v2 → v3 = (1/2) v2 * sqrt(2) )= (v2 * sqrt(2))/2 → v3 = v2 * (sqrt(2)/2 ) = v2 (1/√2 )

So from row 1, v1 = (1/√2) v2.

From row 2, v3= (1/√2) v2.

So the eigenvector can be written as ( (1/√2) v2, v2, (1/√2) v2 ) → v2 * (1/√2, 1, 1/√2 )

So an eigenvector is (1/√2, 1, 1/√2 ), scaled by v2. Let's choose v2=1: (1/√2, 1, 1/√2 ). Let me check if this is correct.

Multiply P with this vector:

Row 1: 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*1 +0*(1/√2) = 1/√2. But the expected result is λ=1 times the vector's first component, which is (1/√2)*1 = 1/√2. So row1: 1/√2. Which matches.

Row 2: (1/√2)*(1/√2) + 0*1 + (1/√2)*(1/√2) → (1/2) + 0 + (1/2) = 1. Which is the second component of the vector (1/√2,1,1/√2) multiplied by λ=1 → 1.

Wait, no: the vector after multiplication by P should have components (1/√2, 1, 1/√2 ) multiplied by 1. So row 2: 1, which matches.

Row3: 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*1 + 0*(1/√2) = 1/√2. Which matches the third component of the vector, which is 1/√2. So yes, P * (1/√2, 1, 1/√2 )^T = (1/√2, 1, 1/√2 )^T. So this vector is an eigenvector for λ=1.

But wait, let's make sure it's normalized. The length squared is (1/√2)^2 + 1^2 + (1/√2)^2 = (1/2) +1 + (1/2)= 2. So the norm is sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/√2, 1, 1/√2 ) / sqrt(2) → (1/(√2 * sqrt(2)), 1/sqrt(2), 1/(√2 * sqrt(2)) ) → (1/2, 1/sqrt(2), 1/2 )

Wait, let me compute it again. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to normalize it later when calculating the projection.

Eigenvalue λ=-1.

We solve (P + I) v =0.

Matrix P + I:

1    1/√2    0
1/√2 1     1/√2
0    1/√2   1

So the system is:

1*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 =0 → v1 + (1/√2) v2 =0 → v1= - (1/√2) v2.

Row2: (1/√2) v1 + 1*v2 + (1/√2) v3 =0 → substituting v1= - (1/√2) v2:

(1/√2)(-1/√2 v2) + v2 + (1/√2) v3 =0 → (-1/2 v2) + v2 + (1/√2) v3 =0 → (1/2 v2) + (1/√2) v3 =0 → (1/√2) v3 = - (1/2) v2 → v3= - (1/(2)) * sqrt(2) v2 → v3= - (v2 * sqrt(2)/2 ) = - (v2 * 1/√2 )

So v3= - v2 / √2.

So the eigenvector can be written as ( - (1/√2) v2 , v2, - (1/√2) v2 )

Let me factor out v2: v2 * (-1/√2, 1, -1/√2 )

So an eigenvector is (-1/√2, 1, -1/√2 ), scaled by v2=1.

Let me check if this is correct.

Multiply P by this vector:

Row1: 0*(-1/√2) + (1/√2)*1 +0*(-1/√2) = 1/√2.

But λ=-1, so the result should be -1 times the original vector's first component, which is (-1/√2)*-1 = 1/√2. So row1 gives 1/√2, which matches.

Row2: (1/√2)*(-1/√2) +0*1 + (1/√2)*(-1/√2) → (-1/2) + 0 + (-1/2) )= -1.

Which is -1 times the second component of the vector (1), so -1. Correct.

Row3: 0*(-1/√2) + (1/√2)*1 +0*(-1/√2) =1/√2.

Which is -1 times the third component of the vector, which is -1/√2 → -1*(-1/√2)=1/√2. Correct.

So the eigenvectors are correct.

Now, the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue are:

λ=0: e0 = (1, 0, -1 )

λ=1: e1 = (1/√2, 1, 1/√2 )

λ=-1: e-1 = (-1/√2, 1, -1/√2 )

Wait, but let me check if these are orthonormal.

Wait, let me compute their inner products.

e0 · e1: (1)(1/√2) + (0)(1) + (-1)(1/√2) → (1/√2) +0 + (-1/√2) =0.

e0 · e-1: (1)(-1/√2) +0*(1) + (-1)(-1/√2) → (-1/√2)+0 + (1/√2 )=0.

e1 · e-1: (1/√2)(-1/√2) + (1)(1) + (1/√2)(-1/√2 ) → (-1/2) +1 + (-1/2) = (-1) +1=0.

So they are mutually orthogonal. Good, so each eigenspace is orthogonal to the others.

Now, to find the coefficients a, b, c in ψ = a e0 + b e1 + c e-1.

But wait, ψ is the normalized state vector, which is ( -1, 2, 1 ) / sqrt(6) → ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )

To find a, which is the coefficient for e0, we compute the inner product of ψ with e0.

Similarly for b and c.

So a = ψ · e0.

Similarly, b= ψ · e1, c= ψ · e-1.

But wait, we have to make sure that the eigenvectors are normalized. Let me check their norms.

e0: (1, 0, -1) → norm squared is 1^2 +0 + (-1)^2 =2 → norm is sqrt(2). So normalized e0 would be (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2) )

e1: (1/√2, 1, 1/√2 )

Norm squared: (1/√2)^2 +1^2 + (1/√2)^2 = (1/2) +1 + (1/2)= 2 → norm sqrt(2). So normalized e1 is (1/(2), 1/sqrt(2), 1/(2) )? Wait, no. Wait, original e1 is (1/√2, 1, 1/√2 ). Its norm is sqrt( (1/2) +1 + (1/2) )=sqrt(2). So the unit vector would be (1/√2)/sqrt(2) = 1/(√2 * sqrt(2) )=1/(2 ). So normalized e1 is (1/(2), 1/sqrt(2), 1/(2) ). Wait, perhaps I should compute it as e1_normalized = (1/√2, 1, 1/√2 ) / sqrt(2) = (1/(2 ), 1/sqrt(2), 1/(2 )).

Similarly, e-1: ( -1/√2, 1, -1/√2 )

Norm squared: (1/2) +1 + (1/2 )=2 → norm sqrt(2). So normalized e-1 is ( -1/(2 ), 1/sqrt(2 ), -1/(2 ) )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute a as the inner product of ψ with e0, but normalized.

Wait, but maybe it's better to write the eigenvectors as orthonormal vectors. Let me make them unit vectors.

e0_normalized = (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2) )

e1_normalized = (1/(2 ), 1/sqrt(2), 1/(2 ) )

Wait, wait, let me correctly compute e1_normalized. The original e1 is (1/√2, 1, 1/√2 ). The norm is sqrt( (1/√2)^2 + 1^2 + (1/√2)^2 ) = sqrt( 1/2 +1 +1/2 )=sqrt(2). So to normalize, divide by sqrt(2):

e1_normalized = ( (1/√2)/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2), (1/√2)/sqrt(2) )

Which is (1/(2), 1/sqrt(2), 1/(2) )

Similarly, e-1_normalized = ( (-1/√2)/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2), (-1/√2)/sqrt(2) ) → ( -1/(2 ), 1/sqrt(2 ), -1/(2 ) )

Now, our state ψ is ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )

We can express ψ as a linear combination of e0_normalized, e1_normalized, e-1_normalized.

So the coefficients a, b, c are the inner products of ψ with each normalized eigenvector.

So:

a = ψ · e0_normalized = [ (-1/sqrt(6)) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) + (2/sqrt(6)) * 0 + (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1/sqrt(2)) )

= [ (-1)/(sqrt(6)sqrt(2)) ) + 0 + (-1)/(sqrt(6)sqrt(2)) ) ]

= [ (-2) ] / ( sqrt(12) )

sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3), so 2/(2 sqrt(3)) ) = 1/sqrt(3)

But wait, let me compute step by step.

Denote:

a = [ (-1/sqrt(6)) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) ] + [ 2/sqrt(6) * 0 ] + [ (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1/sqrt(2)) ) ]

= [ (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ) ] + 0 + [ (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) )

= [ (-1) / (sqrt(12)) ) ] + [ (-1)/(sqrt(12)) )

= [ (-1 -1) ] / sqrt(12) )

= (-2)/sqrt(12)

Simplify sqrt(12)=2*sqrt(3), so:

a= (-2)/(2 sqrt(3)) )= (-1)/sqrt(3)

So the coefficient a is -1/sqrt(3).

Wait, but wait. Let me compute again:

sqrt(6)*sqrt(2) = sqrt(12) = 2*sqrt(3). So each term is (-1)/(2*sqrt(3)) ), and there are two such terms.

So a = [ (-1)/(2√3) ) ] + [ (-1)/(2√3) ) ] = (-2)/(2√3) )= (-1)/√3.

So a = -1/√3. The modulus squared is (1/3).

Therefore, the probability of measuring 0 is |a|^2 = (1/√3)^2 =1/3.

So the answer is 1/3, which is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the system's state and the observable's matrix to determine the probability of measuring 0 for the observable \( P \).

### Step 1: Normalize the state vector
The state vector is given as \( \psi = (-1, 2, 1)^T \). Its norm is calculated as:

\[
\|\psi\| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{1 + 4 + 1} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

The normalized state vector is:

\[
\psi_{\text{normalized}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Determine the eigenvalues of \( P \)
The observable \( P \) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

To find the eigenvalues, we solve the characteristic equation \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \). After computation, the eigenvalues are found to be:

\[
\lambda = 0, \, 1, \, -1.
\]

### Step 3: Find eigenvectors of \( P \)
For each eigenvalue, we compute the corresponding eigenvectors:

1. **For \( \lambda = 0 \):** The eigenvector is \( e_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \).
2. **For \( \lambda = 1 \):** The eigenvector is \( e_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 1 \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \end{pmatrix} \).
3. **For \( \lambda = -1 \):** The eigenvector is \( e_{-1} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 1 \\ -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \end{pmatrix} \).

These eigenvectors are mutually orthogonal and normalized.

### Step 4: Express \( \psi_{\text{normalized}} \) in terms of eigenvectors
The normalized state vector \( \psi_{\text{normalized}} \) can be expressed as a linear combination of the eigenvectors:

\[
\psi_{\text{normalized}} = a e_0 + b e_1 + c e_{-1}.
\]

The coefficients \( a, b, c \) are computed as the inner products of \( \psi_{\text{normalized}} \) with each eigenvector:

1. **Coefficient \( a \):**

\[
a = \psi_{\text{normalized}} \cdot e_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

\[
a = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6} \sqrt{2}} \left( (-1)(1) + (2)(0) + (1)(-1) \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} (-1 - 1) = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

2. **Coefficient \( b \):**

\[
b = \psi_{\text{normalized}} \cdot e_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 1 \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \end{pmatrix}.
\]

\[
b = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6} \sqrt{2}} \left( (-1)\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + (2)(1) + (1)\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + 2 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}.
\]

3. **Coefficient \( c \):**

\[
c = \psi_{\text{normalized}} \cdot e_{-1} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 1 \\ -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \end{pmatrix}.
\]

\[
c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6} \sqrt{2}} \left( (-1)\left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) + (2)(1) + (1)\left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + 2 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}.
\]

### Step 5: Compute the probability of measuring 0
The probability of measuring 0 is the square of the absolute value of the coefficient \( a \):

\[
P(0) = |a|^2 = \left| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probability of measuring 0 is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

**Answer: C**
