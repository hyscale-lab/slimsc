Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that there's an operator P with components Px, Py, and Pz. We're given their matrix forms in a basis of eigenvectors of Pz. The system is found in an eigenstate of Px with eigenvalue -ħ. The explicit state is given as a column vector (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). We need to find the uncertainty ΔPz of the operator Pz.

Hmm, okay. So, I remember that the uncertainty of an operator is given by the square root of the variance, which is ⟨ψ| A² |ψ⟩ - ⟨ψ| A |ψ⟩². So for Pz, ΔPz = sqrt(⟨Pz²⟩ - ⟨Pz⟩²).

Wait, but first, since the state is given as a vector, I can compute the expectation values directly. Because the basis vectors are the eigenstates of Pz, the matrix should be diagonal in this basis. Wait, no, looking at the matrix for Pz, let me see. The matrix is diagonal: [ [ħ, 0, 0], [0,0,0], [0,0, -ħ] ]. So yes, it's diagonal, so the basis is the eigenbasis of Pz.

So the state is given in this basis. The state vector is (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me first normalize this vector to be sure. The sum of the squares of the components should be 1 if it's normalized.

Calculating the norm: (-1/2)^2 + (1/√2)^2 + (-1/2)^2. That's (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = 1/4 + 2/4 + 1/4 = 4/4 = 1. So it's already a unit vector. Good.

Now, to find ⟨Pz⟩, I can just take the components of the state vector multiplied by the corresponding eigenvalues of Pz. Because in the eigenbasis, the expectation value is the sum of |c_i|^2 times the eigenvalue.

So, the eigenvalues of Pz are ħ, 0, and -ħ. The state vector has components a= -1/2, b=1/√2, c= -1/2. So, their squared magnitudes are (1/4), (1/2), and (1/4) respectively.

So ⟨Pz⟩ = (|a|²)(ħ) + (|b|²)(0) + (|c|²)(-ħ) = (1/4) ħ + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(-ħ) = (1/4 -1/4) ħ = 0. So the expectation value of Pz is zero. Interesting.

Now, ⟨Pz²⟩ is the expectation value of Pz squared. Well, in the eigenbasis, Pz² is just the diagonal matrix with (ħ)^2, (0)^2, (-ħ)^2. So the expectation value is sum of |c_i|^2 times (eigenvalue squared). So that's (1/4)(ħ²) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(ħ²) = (1/4 +1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So the variance is ⟨Pz²⟩ - (⟨Pz⟩)^2 = (1/2 ħ²) - (0)^2 = 1/2 ħ². So the uncertainty ΔPz is sqrt(1/2 ħ²) = (ħ) * sqrt(1/2) )= ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. The state is in the eigenbasis of Pz, so when you compute ⟨Pz⟩, it's just the weighted sum of the eigenvalues. So yes, each component's square gives the weight. So for the first component, -1/2, the square is 1/4, multiply by ħ: 1/4 ħ. Third component, -1/2, so square is 1/4, multiply by -ħ: 1/4 (-ħ). So 1/4 ħ -1/4 ħ = 0. That's correct.

For ⟨Pz²⟩, each eigenvalue squared is ħ², 0, ħ². So 1/4 * ħ² + 1/2 * 0 + 1/4 * ħ² = (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = 1/2 ħ².

So variance is 1/2 ħ². So uncertainty is sqrt(1/2 ħ²) = (ħ) * (1/√2) ) = ħ/√2.

Looking at the options, option B is ħ/√2. So the answer should be B.

To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

The system is in the eigenstate of $P_x$ with eigenvalue $-\hbar$, and the state vector is given as $(-1/2, 1/\sqrt{2}, -1/2)$. Since the basis vectors are the eigenstates of $P_z$, the matrix for $P_z$ is diagonal in this basis, with eigenvalues $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$. The state vector is already normalized, as the sum of the squares of its components is $1$.

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is calculated as the weighted sum of the eigenvalues of $P_z$, weighted by the squared magnitudes of the components of the state vector. The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$, and the squared magnitudes of the state vector components are $| -1/2 |^2 = 1/4$, $| 1/\sqrt{2} |^2 = 1/2$, and $| -1/2 |^2 = 1/4$. Thus:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)(\hbar) + \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)(0) + \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)(-\hbar) = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ has eigenvalues $(\hbar)^2$, $(0)^2$, and $(-\hbar)^2$, which are $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$, respectively. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is similarly calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)(\hbar^2) + \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)(0) + \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)(\hbar^2) = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the Uncertainty $\Delta P_z$
The variance is given by:

\[
\text{Var}(P_z) = \langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

Thus, the uncertainty is:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\text{Var}(P_z)} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$. Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:

**B) $\hbar/\sqrt{2}$**
