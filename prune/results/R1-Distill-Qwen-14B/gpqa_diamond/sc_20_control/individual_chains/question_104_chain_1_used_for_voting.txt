Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember the radial velocity method detects planets by looking at the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. So the star moves a little, and that causes the spectral lines to shift back and forth.

The question says there are two stars with exactly the same masses as each other, each hosting a planet similar in mass to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits, so that simplifies things a bit.

The key data here is the periodic shift of the spectral lines. For planet #1, it's 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. Wait, wait. I think the Doppler shift is related to the velocity of the star. Oh right! The amplitude of the Doppler shift (the maximum shift) is proportional to the velocity of the star in its orbit. So a larger shift means the star is moving faster.

But how does the star's velocity relate to the planet's orbital period? Oh, right, the star's velocity is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. I remember the formula for the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by something like K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1 / ( (P) * (1/( (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) )) ) ) but wait, since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so the denominator simplifies. But wait, the stars' masses are similar to the Sun, and the planets are Neptune-like, which is much smaller than the star, so M_planet << M_star. So M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So I can probably approximate M_star + M_planet as just M_star.

The formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is approximately K ≈ ( ( (2π G) / (P c ) )^(1/3) ) * (M_planet sin i) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) ), but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Alternatively, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * P ) / (2π c ) )^(1/3) ) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (1 + M_planet/M_star )^(1/3) )

But since M_planet << M_star, the denominator's term can be approximated as (M_star)^(1/3).

Wait, perhaps the more straightforward approach is to consider the relation between the star's velocity and the orbital period. The star's velocity in its orbit (v) is related to the planet's orbital period (P) and the size of the orbit (a), via v = 2π a / P. But wait, that's for circular orbits. But in the case of the radial velocity method, the velocity is actually the star's velocity in its orbit around the barycenter. So the star's velocity (v) is related to the planet's velocity. Also, from Kepler's third law, the orbital period P is related to the semi-major axis a and the total mass.

Wait, Kepler's third law in terms of velocity might be tricky. Alternatively, considering that the velocity of the star (v) is inversely proportional to the orbital period (P) for the same semi-major axis, but I'm not sure. Let me think of it another way.

Let me recall that the Doppler shift (the velocity semi-amplitude K) is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * (2π / P) )^(1/3) ) * [ ( (1 + M_p/M_*) ) ]^(-1/3) )

Wait, maybe I should think about the formula for K. The formula for the semi-amplitude K is:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * ( (2π) / (P (1 - e²) ) ) )^(1/3) ) ) * ( sin i ) / (c )

But since e=0, and M_p << M_*, this simplifies to:

K ≈ ( ( G M_p ) / ( M_* ) )^(1/3) * ( 2π / P )^(1/3 ) ) / c

Wait, maybe that's not the right approach. Alternatively, let's think about the relation between K and P. Let's ignore some constants for a moment.

K is proportional to (M_p / M_* )^(1/3) * (1/P)^(1/3). Or wait, let's see. Kepler's third law says that P² = (4π²/G(M_* + M_p)) a³. Since M_p is much smaller than M_*, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So P² ≈ (4π² a³) / (G M_*). 

The star's velocity is v = 2π a / P, because in one orbit (period P), the star moves a distance of 2π a. 

So v = 2π a / P. But from Kepler's law, a³ = (G M_* P² )/(4 π²). So a = [ (G M_* P² )/(4 π²) ]^(1/3 )

Substituting a into v:

v = (2π) [ (G M_* P² / (4 π²) )^(1/3) ] / P 

Let me compute that step by step.

a = [ (G M_* P²)/(4 π²) ) ]^(1/3 )

So 2π a = 2π * [ (G M_* P² / (4 π²) ) ]^(1/3 )

Divide by P: v = [ 2π * (G M_* P² / (4 π²) )^(1/3) ] / P 

Let me simplify this expression. Let me write it as:

v = (2π) * [ (G M_* )^(1/3) (P²)^(1/3) ) / (4 π²)^(1/3) ) ] / P 

Which can be written as:

v = (2π) * [ (G M_* )^(1/3) P^(2/3) ) / (4 π²)^(1/3) ) ] * (1/P )

Simplify the denominator: (4 π²)^(1/3) = 4^(1/3) π^(2/3)

So,

v = (2 π) * (G M_* )^(1/3) P^(2/3) ) / (4^(1/3) π^(2/3) ) ) * (1/P )

Combine the terms:

(2 π) / (4^(1/3) π^(2/3) ) ) = [ 2 / (4^(1/3) ) ] * [ π^(1) / π^(2/3) ) ] 

Which is [ 2 / (2^(2/3) ) ) ] * [ π^(1 - 2/3) ) ] 

Simplify 2 / 2^(2/3) = 2^(1 - 2/3) = 2^(1/3) 
And π^(1/3) 

So factors are 2^(1/3) * π^(1/3) 

So v = [ 2^(1/3) π^(1/3) ) ] * (G M_* )^(1/3) P^(2/3 - 1) )

Because P^(2/3) / P = P^(2/3 - 3/3) ) = P^(-1/3) )

So,

v = [ (2 π G M_* )^(1/3) ) ] * P^(-1/3) )

So v is proportional to (M_*)^(1/3) * P^(-1/3)

But wait, in our case, the two stars have the same mass (M_* same), and both planets have similar masses, so M_p is the same for both. But in the expression for K, which is v, the dependence is on (M_p / M_* )^(1/3) * (1/P)^(1/3) ?

Wait, perhaps I should think about K in terms of P and other parameters. 

Wait, from Kepler's third law, P² ∝ a³/(M_*). So a ∝ (P² M_*)^(1/3).

The velocity of the star is v = 2π a / P. Substituting a from above:

v = 2π [ (P² M_*)^(1/3) ) ] / P 

= 2π (P²)^(1/3) (M_*)^(1/3) ) / P 

= 2π (M_*)^(1/3) * P^(2/3 - 3/3 )

= 2π (M_*)^(1/3) * P^(-1/3 )

So v ∝ (M_*)^(1/3) * P^(-1/3 )

But wait, in the problem, the stars have the same mass, so M_* is the same for both. So for the same M_*, the velocity v is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

That is, v ∝ 1 / P^(1/3 )

So if K (the velocity) is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then P is proportional to (1 / K )^3.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Since v is proportional to (1 / P^(1/3) ), then P^(1/3 ) is proportional to 1 / v, so P is proportional to (1/v)^3.

So P ∝ 1/(v^3 )

But in our case, the two stars have the same mass, and the two planets have similar masses. So the only difference is the Doppler shift, i.e., the velocity K.

So if K1 is 5 miliangstroms and K2 is 7 miliangstroms, then their velocities are in the ratio K1/K2 =5/7.

But velocity is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so:

v1 / v2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

Because v is inversely proportional to P^(1/3 ), so higher velocity means shorter period.

So K1 is smaller than K2, meaning v1 is 5/7 of v2. So 5/7 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

Wait, wait. Let me get the proportionality right. Since v ∝ 1 / P^(1/3 ), then v1 = C / P1^(1/3 ), v2 = C / P2^(1/3 ), where C is a constant.

So v1 / v2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

So (5/7) = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

To solve for P2 / P1, cube both sides:

(5/7)^3 = P2 / P1

Which is 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1. Therefore, the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. Wait, wait, no. The question says: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1? So if P2 is 0.364 * P1, then P2 is shorter than P1. So the ratio is P2/P1 ≈ 0.364, so planet #2's period is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So planet #2's period is shorter, so the answer would be approximately 0.36 times, meaning planet #2's period is shorter.

But wait, the question is: How many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 than planet #1? So that would be P2 / P1. Which is about 0.36, which means it's shorter, not longer. So the answer would be approximately 0.36 times as long, so the period is shorter.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.36. So the answer would be A.

Wait, let me double-check the steps. 

Because v is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 must be smaller than P1. So P2 = (v1 / v2)^3 * P1. 

Wait, no. Let me think with the proportionality again.

v ∝ 1/(P)^(1/3 )

So for star 1, v1 = k / P1^(1/3 )

Similarly, v2 = k / P2^(1/3 )

So v1 / v2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

So if v1 is 5 and v2 is 7, then 5/7 = (P2/P1 )^(1/3 )

Cube both sides: (5/7)^3 = P2/P1 => 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1, so P2 is shorter. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times as long as planet #1, which means it's shorter. So the question asks how many times longer P2 is than P1. So the ratio is 0.36, which is less than 1. So planet #2's period is 0.36 times as long, so it's shorter.

So the answer is option A) ~0.36.

The radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by measuring the Doppler shift in the spectral lines of the host star, which is proportional to the star's velocity in its orbit around the barycenter. In this problem, two stars with identical masses host planets with similar masses to Neptune, and the RV shifts for the two stars are given as 5 milliangstroms (planet #1) and 7 milliangstroms (planet #2). The goal is to determine how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

From Kepler's third law, the orbital period \( P \) is related to the semi-major axis \( a \) and the total mass of the system. For circular orbits and when the planet mass is negligible compared to the star, the star's velocity \( v \) is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \), i.e., \( v \propto P^{-1/3} \). Since the RV shift is proportional to the star's velocity, the ratio of the RV shifts corresponds to the inverse cube root of the ratio of the orbital periods:

\[
\frac{v_1}{v_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Given \( v_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( v_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \), the ratio of the RV shifts is:

\[
\frac{v_1}{v_2} = \frac{5}{7}.
\]

Substituting into the proportionality:

\[
\frac{5}{7} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Cubing both sides:

\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{P_2}{P_1}.
\]

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364.
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times as long as that of planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, the answer is approximately 0.36.

I think the Doppler shift is related to the velocity of the star. Oh right! The amplitude of the Doppler shift (the maximum shift) is proportional to the velocity of the star in its orbit. So a larger shift means the star is moving faster.

But how does the star's velocity relate to the planet's orbital period? Oh, right, the star's velocity is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. I remember the formula for the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by something like K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1 / ( (P) * (1/( (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) )) ) ) but wait, since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so the denominator simplifies. But wait, the stars' masses are similar to the Sun, and the planets are Neptune-like, which is much smaller than the star, so M_planet << M_star. So M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So I can probably approximate M_star + M_planet as just M_star.

The formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is approximately K ≈ ( ( (2π G) / (P c ) )^(1/3) ) * (M_planet sin i) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) ), but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Alternatively, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * P ) / (2π c ) )^(1/3) ) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (1 + M_planet/M_star )^(1/3) )

But since M_planet << M_star, the denominator's term can be approximated as (M_star)^(1/3).

Wait, perhaps the more straightforward approach is to consider the relation between the star's velocity and the orbital period. The star's velocity in its orbit (v) is related to the planet's orbital period (P) and the size of the orbit (a), via v = 2π a / P. But wait, that's for circular orbits. But in the case of the radial velocity method, the velocity is actually the star's velocity in its orbit around the barycenter. So the star's velocity (v) is related to the planet's velocity. Also, from Kepler's third law, the orbital period P is related to the semi-major axis a and the total mass.

Wait, Kepler's third law in terms of velocity might be tricky. Alternatively, considering that the velocity of the star (v) is inversely proportional to the orbital period (P) for the same semi-major axis, but I'm not sure. Let me think of it another way.

Let me recall that the Doppler shift (the velocity semi-amplitude K) is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * (2π / P) )^(1/3) ) * [ ( (1 + M_p/M_*) ) ]^(-1/3) )

Wait, maybe I should think about the formula for K. The formula for the semi-amplitude K is:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * ( (2π) / (P (1 - e²) ) ) )^(1/3) ) ) * ( sin i ) / (c )

But since e=0, and M_p << M_*, this simplifies to:

K ≈ ( ( G M_p ) / ( M_* ) )^(1/3) * ( 2π / P )^(1/3 ) ) / c

Wait, maybe that's not the right approach. Alternatively, let's think about the relation between K and P. Let's ignore some constants for a moment.

K is proportional to (M_p / M_* )^(1/3) * (1/P)^(1/3). Or wait, let's see. Kepler's third law says that P² = (4π²/G(M_* + M_p)) a³. Since M_p is much smaller than M_*, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So P² ≈ (4π² a³) / (G M_*). 

The star's velocity is v = 2π a / P, because in one orbit (period P), the star moves a distance of 2π a. 

So v = 2π a / P. But from Kepler's law, a³ = (G M_* P² )/(4 π²). So a = [ (G M_* P² )/(4 π²) ]^(1/3 )

Substituting a into v:

v = (2π) [ (G M_* P² / (4 π²) )^(1/3) ] / P 

Let me compute that step by step.

a = [ (G M_* P²)/(4 π²) ) ]^(1/3 )

So 2π a = 2π * [ (G M_* P² / (4 π²) ) ]^(1/3 )

Divide by P: v = [ 2π * (G M_* P² / (4 π²) )^(1/3) ] / P 

Let me simplify this expression. Let me write it as:

v = (2π) * [ (G M_* )^(1/3) (P²)^(1/3) ) / (4 π²)^(1/3) ) ] / P 

Which can be written as:

v = (2π) * [ (G M_* )^(1/3) P^(2/3) ) / (4 π²)^(1/3) ) ] * (1/P )

Simplify the denominator: (4 π²)^(1/3) = 4^(1/3) π^(2/3)

So,

v = (2 π) * (G M_* )^(1/3) P^(2/3) ) / (4^(1/3) π^(2/3) ) ) * (1/P )

Combine the terms:

(2 π) / (4^(1/3) π^(2/3) ) ) = [ 2 / (4^(1/3) ) ] * [ π^(1) / π^(2/3) ) ] 

Which is [ 2 / (2^(2/3) ) ) ] * [ π^(1 - 2/3) ) ] 

Simplify 2 / 2^(2/3) = 2^(1 - 2/3) = 2^(1/3) 
And π^(1/3) 

So factors are 2^(1/3) * π^(1/3) 

So v = [ 2^(1/3) π^(1/3) ) ] * (G M_* )^(1/3) P^(2/3 - 1) )

Because P^(2/3) / P = P^(2/3 - 3/3) ) = P^(-1/3) )

So,

v = [ (2 π G M_* )^(1/3) ) ] * P^(-1/3) )

So v is proportional to (M_*)^(1/3) * P^(-1/3)

But wait, in our case, the two stars have the same mass (M_* same), and both planets have similar masses, so M_p is the same for both. But in the expression for K, which is v, the dependence is on (M_p / M_* )^(1/3) * (1/P)^(1/3) ?

Wait, perhaps I should think about K in terms of P and other parameters. 

Wait, from Kepler's third law, P² ∝ a³/(M_*). So a ∝ (P² M_*)^(1/3).

The velocity of the star is v = 2π a / P. Substituting a from above:

v = 2π [ (P² M_*)^(1/3) ) ] / P 

= 2π (P²)^(1/3) (M_*)^(1/3) ) / P 

= 2π (M_*)^(1/3) * P^(2/3 - 3/3 )

= 2π (M_*)^(1/3) * P^(-1/3 )

So v ∝ (M_*)^(1/3) * P^(-1/3 )

But wait, in the problem, the stars have the same mass, so M_* is the same for both. So for the same M_*, the velocity v is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

That is, v ∝ 1 / P^(1/3 )

So if K (the velocity) is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then P is proportional to (1 / K )^3.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Since v is proportional to (1 / P^(1/3) ), then P^(1/3 ) is proportional to 1 / v, so P is proportional to (1/v)^3.

So P ∝ 1/(v^3 )

But in our case, the two stars have the same mass, and the two planets have similar masses. So the only difference is the Doppler shift, i.e., the velocity K.

So if K1 is 5 miliangstroms and K2 is 7 miliangstroms, then their velocities are in the ratio K1/K2 =5/7.

But velocity is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so:

v1 / v2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

Because v is inversely proportional to P^(1/3 ), so higher velocity means shorter period.

So K1 is smaller than K2, meaning v1 is 5/7 of v2. So 5/7 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

Wait, wait. Let me get the proportionality right. Since v ∝ 1 / P^(1/3 ), then v1 = C / P1^(1/3 ), v2 = C / P2^(1/3 ), where C is a constant.

So v1 / v2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

So (5/7) = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

To solve for P2 / P1, cube both sides:

(5/7)^3 = P2 / P1

Which is 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1. Therefore, the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. Wait, wait, no. The question says: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1? So if P2 is 0.364 * P1, then P2 is shorter than P1. So the ratio is P2/P1 ≈ 0.364, so planet #2's period is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So planet #2's period is shorter, so the answer would be approximately 0.36 times, meaning planet #2's period is shorter.

But wait, the question is: How many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 than planet #1? So that would be P2 / P1. Which is about 0.36, which means it's shorter, not longer. So the answer would be approximately 0.36 times as long, so the period is shorter.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.36. So the answer would be A.

Wait, let me double-check the steps. 

Because v is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 must be smaller than P1. So P2 = (v1 / v2)^3 * P1. 

Wait, no. Let me think with the proportionality again.

v ∝ 1/(P)^(1/3 )

So for star 1, v1 = k / P1^(1/3 )

Similarly, v2 = k / P2^(1/3 )

So v1 / v2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

So if v1 is 5 and v2 is 7, then 5/7 = (P2/P1 )^(1/3 )

Cube both sides: (5/7)^3 = P2/P1 => 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1, so P2 is shorter. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times as long as planet #1, which means it's shorter. So the question asks how many times longer P2 is than P1. So the ratio is 0.36, which is less than 1. So planet #2's period is 0.36 times as long, so it's shorter.

So the answer is option A) ~0.36.


The radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by measuring the Doppler shift in the spectral lines of the host star, which is proportional to the star's velocity in its orbit around the barycenter. In this problem, two stars with identical masses host planets with similar masses to Neptune, and the RV shifts for the two stars are given as 5 milliangstroms (planet #1) and 7 milliangstroms (planet #2). The goal is to determine how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

From Kepler's third law, the orbital period \( P \) is related to the semi-major axis \( a \) and the total mass of the system. For circular orbits and when the planet mass is negligible compared to the star, the star's velocity \( v \) is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \), i.e., \( v \propto P^{-1/3} \). Since the RV shift is proportional to the star's velocity, the ratio of the RV shifts corresponds to the inverse cube root of the ratio of the orbital periods:

\[
\frac{v_1}{v_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Given \( v_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( v_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \), the ratio of the RV shifts is:

\[
\frac{v_1}{v_2} = \frac{5}{7}.
\]

Substituting into the proportionality:

\[
\frac{5}{7} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Cubing both sides:

\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{P_2}{P_1}.
\]

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364.
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times as long as that of planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, the answer is approximately 0.36.
