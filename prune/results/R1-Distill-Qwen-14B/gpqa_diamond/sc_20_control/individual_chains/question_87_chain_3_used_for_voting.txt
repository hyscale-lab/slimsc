Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about an organic chemistry problem. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question says that there's a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms in total. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me break it down.

So, a 6-membered aromatic ring, like benzene, but di-substituted. Di-substituted means there are two substituents attached to the ring. The molecular formula probably has 8 carbons in total. Benzene has 6 carbons, so the two substituents combined add 2 more carbons. Because 6 (benzene) + 2 (substituents) = 8.

Wait, but substituents could be different. Wait, the substituents could be things like methyl groups or other groups. Oh, but waitâ€”wait, the question mentions that in the FTIR spectrum, there's a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. So the compound has both a carbonyl (like a ketone or ester or something with C=O) and a halogen attached to the aromatic ring.

So the two substituents on the benzene ring are a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen. Or wait, maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group, and the other is a halogen. Because di-substituted would mean two substituents on the benzene ring.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the possible structures. Let me consider the substituents. One substituent is a carbonyl group. But how can a benzene ring have a carbonyl group? Well, maybe it's a ketone attached as a substituent. Like, for example, acetophenone. But wait, acetophenone is a single substituent. Or perhaps the substituents are a carbonyl-containing group and a halide.

Wait, but the question says the compound is di-substituted. So two substituents are attached to the benzene ring. Each substituent could be something. Since one of them is a carbonyl group (like a ketone, maybe), and another is a halogen. Or perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl and the other is a halogen attached as another group.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps one substituent is an acyl group, like an ester or something, and another is a halogen. Or perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group and another substituent is an aryl group? No, that probably doesn't fit with the carbonyl and halogen in IR.

Wait, another thought: maybe the substituents are a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde) and a halogen (like Cl or Br) attached to the ring. So the benzene has two substituents: one is a carbonyl group (like a ketone), and another is a halogen.

But wait, another possibility is that one substituent is a group that includes both a carbonyl and a halogen. But that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group, and the other is a halogen attached directly to the ring.

Wait, but another possibility is that the substituents could be a carbonyl-containing group and another group that also has a carbonyl, but the halogen could be part of another substituent. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the molecular formula again.

The compound has 8 carbons in total. Benzene is 6 carbons. So the substituents add 2 carbons. So the two substituents must have a combined of 2 carbons. So each substituent could be a methyl group with something attached. For example, one substituent is a methyl ketone (like a propanone substituent?), but that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group (like O=C-R) and the other is a halogen.

But if the substituents are a carbonyl group (which would have more than one carbon, perhaps), wait, but their total is 2 carbons. Let me think: benzene has 6 carbons. So substituents are two groups adding 2 carbons. So each substituent must be a methyl group? No, because a methyl group is one carbon. Wait, if the substituents are a -CO- group, that would require more than one carbon. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are a halogen and a carbonyl-containing group. Let me think: benzene ring with two substituents. One substituent is a carbonyl group. Let's say substituent A is a carbonyl group, like -CO-R, but R has to be such that the total carbons are 8.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an acetyl group. So benzene with an acetyl group (which is two carbons: COCH3). Then, the other substituent would have to be zero carbons because 6 (benzene) + 2 (acetyl) = 8. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because 6 + substituents (each substituent adds some carbons). Oh, wait, substituents can be groups that have multiple carbons, but in this case, the total is 8, so the substituents must add up to 2. So if one substituent is a methyl group (1 carbon), the other must be another group with 1 carbon. But then, one substituent is a carbonyl group.

Wait, maybe one substituent is a methyl ketone group, like -COCH3, which would add two carbons (the CO and CH3). Then, the other substituent would have zero carbons. That can't be possible. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group (like -O=C-O-R), but that seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the substituents. If the benzene ring has two substituents, each must be a group that contributes to the carbons. The total is 8 carbons, so substituents sum to 2 carbons. So substituents must be two methyl groups, but then where's the carbonyl and halogen?

Wait, no. Because then, the substituents would be -CH3 and another group that's something else. But the FTIR shows a carbonyl. So substituents must include a carbonyl and a halogen. Let's think: if one substituent is -Cl and the other is -COCH3 (which is two carbons). So benzene with a Cl and a COCH3 group. Then, the total carbons would be 6 (benzene) + 1 (Cl doesn't add a carbon) + 2 (COCH3) = 9? Wait, no. Wait, benzene is 6 carbons, substituents are Cl (0 carbons) and COCH3 (2 carbons). So 6 + 0 +2 =8. Oh, that makes sense.

So the structure is benzene with a Cl and a COCH3 group attached. So it's a di-substituted benzene with substituents Cl and COCH3. Now, the question is about the 1H NMR spectrum.

The options are A, B, C, D.

Looking at each option:

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s). Hmm, a singlet at 9.9 is probably an aldehyde proton. But wait, if the substituent is COCH3, that's a ketone, not an aldehyde. So that's a problem. Unless the structure is different.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the substituent is an -O-CO-R group, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a nitro group, but that doesn't have a carbonyl in the NMR.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a carbonyl group in a different position.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl but in a different functional group, like an ester or something else.

Wait, if the substituent is COCH3 (an acetyl group), then the NMR would show a singlet for the CH3 attached to the carbonyl, but in option A, 3.7 ppm is a singlet for 2H, which would be a CH2 group, maybe. Hmm, but in COCH3, the CH3 would be around 2.6 ppm as a singlet. So option A's 3.7 (2H, s) doesn't fit. So maybe option A isn't the right one.

Option B: Peaks at 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s). These look like they could be from an ester group or a geminal di-substitution. Wait, 4.8 and 4.6 are around where CH2 groups attached to oxygen might appear. Maybe a methylene group adjacent to oxygen. The 1.3 (3H, s) is likely a methyl group attached to something. But how does this fit with the substituents?

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an acetyloxy group? Like OAc (O-CO-CH3). Then, the OCH2 groups would show up as two doublets around 4.6 and 4.8. But then, where is the Cl? Alternatively, the substituent is a carbonyl group attached to an oxygen, like an ester. But I'm not sure how that would fit with the di-substituted benzene.

Alternatively, the substituents could be a CH2CO group and a Cl. But that's getting complicated. Hmm. I'm not sure about option B.

Option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). The aromatic protons would suggest a para-substituted or some sort of coupling. The 2.3 ppm singlet for 3H is likely a methyl group attached to something deshielded, like a carbonyl. So maybe the substituent is a COCH3 group. Then, the aromatic protons would be in a particular pattern.

If the benzene is di-substituted with Cl and COCH3, their positions would determine the NMR. Let's say the two substituents are para to each other. Then, the aromatic protons would be two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So this matches option C: 7.8 (d, 2H) and 7.6 (d, 2H). The 2.3 ppm singlet is the COCH3 group. But where is the Cl? Wait, the Cl substituent would be on the ring, but it doesn't have any protons attached, so it won't show up in the 1H NMR. Oh wait, but the Cl is part of the substituent on the ring, but as a substituent itself, it doesn't have protons. So the 1H NMR wouldn't show the Cl, only the other substituent's protons.

But wait, if the substituent is Cl, that's a substituent on the benzene. So the substituents are Cl and COCH3. So in the NMR, you'd see the aromatic protons, the COCH3's methyl, and any other protons.

Wait, but in the structure, if the substituents are para to each other, then the aromatic protons would be two sets of two H each, each as doublets. So that's what option C shows: 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). The 2.3 ppm is the COCH3 (singlet, 3H). So all together, that would be 6 aromatic H (as 2 doublets), 3 H from COCH3. But wait, the total H would be 6+3=9? But the molecular formula must fit. Wait, the molecular formula is C8H? Let's see: benzene is C6H6. Each substituent, say, Cl is C0H1, and COCH3 is C2H3O. So total carbons: 6 + 0 (Cl) + 2 (COCH3) = 8. Hydrogens: benzene has 6 H. Cl substituent doesn't add any H. COCH3 substituent has 3 H. So total H is 6 + 3 =9. So molecular formula is C8H9ClO.

Wait, but looking at the NMR data for option C, the integration is 2H + 2H + 3H =7H. But the actual molecule has 9 H. Hmm, that seems off. So perhaps option C is not the right one. Or perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the substituents are not para. Maybe they're meta or ortho. Let me think about the di-substituted benzene.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are both attached in such a way that the aromatic protons are split into a certain pattern. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent with the carbonyl is an acetyl group, and the other substituent is a Cl. So the structure would be something like para-chloroacetophenone.

In that case, the aromatic protons would be in a certain pattern. For para substitution, the ring would have two sets of two protons each, each as doublets. So that's what option C has. So the aromatic signals would be 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d), which matches. And the COCH3 would be a singlet at around 2.3 ppm. So the NMR would have those three signals: 7.8, 7.6, and 2.3. But the integration in option C is 2H + 2H +3H=7H. But the molecule has 6 (benzene) +3 (COCH3) =9 H. So where are the other two H?

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Because option C only shows three sets of signals, but the molecule has more H. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in such a way that the aromatic H are split into more signals. Wait, if substituents are in the meta position, perhaps the aromatic protons would split into more peaks. But in that case, the di-substituted benzene would have more complex splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in the ortho position. Let me think: if the substituents are ortho, then the aromatic H would be adjacent to the substituents, which could cause more splitting. But I'm not sure about the exact pattern.

Wait, perhaps I should consider another possibility for the substituents. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group (like an ester) and the other is a halogen.

Wait, but the carbon count earlier suggests that the substituents are Cl and COCH3. So if that's the case, then the NMR should show the aromatic protons, the COCH3, and any other groups. But the option C only accounts for 7 H, but the molecule has 9 H. So something doesn't add up.

Wait, another thought: maybe the substituent is a carbonyl group attached to the ring as an acyl group, like a ketone. So the structure would be, say, benzophenone with a Cl substituent? Wait, no, that's a different structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl but in another position. Like, maybe a group like O-CO-CH3. But that would be an ester group, which would have more carbons.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl in a different place. Let me think: maybe the substituent is a formyl group (-CHO), which has one carbon. Then, the other substituent is a methyl group (but that would add another carbon). Wait, that would make substituents as -CHO and -CH3, but where's the halogen? Oh, wait, the IR shows a carbonyl (so the substituent is -CHO) and a halogen attached to the ring. So substituents are -Cl and -CHO. Then, the total carbons would be 6 (benzene) + 1 (CHO) + 1 (Cl doesn't add carbon) =8. So that fits.

So in this case, the substituents are -Cl and -CHO. So the structure would be chlorobenzaldehyde. But wait, then the NMR would have a peak for the aldehyde proton. The aldehyde proton is usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. So looking back at the options, option A has a peak at 9.9 ppm (1H, s). So that could fit.

In option A, the aromatic protons are at 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). The 3.7 ppm (2H, s) would be something else, but in the structure I'm considering (Cl and CHO), the substituents are Cl and CHO. So where would the 3.7 ppm peak come from? Maybe it's not from this structure, so maybe option A isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl ketone and a Cl, but in such a way that the NMR would have a peak at 3.7 ppm. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the substituents are a carbonyloxy group and a Cl. Like an ester group. For example, the substituent could be O-CO-R, where R is a methyl group. So the substituent would be OAc (acyloxy group). Then, the substituent would have a carbonyl and an oxygen.

In that case, the structure would be benzene with Cl and OAc substituents. The OAc group would have a methyl group attached to the carbonyl, which would show up as a singlet around 2.1 ppm. But looking at the options, option C has 2.3 ppm as a singlet for 3H, which could match that. But wait, option C's aromatic protons are 7.8 and 7.6, which would fit if the substituents are para.

Wait, but in that case, the substituents would be OAc and Cl. So the NMR would have:

- Aromatic protons as two doublets (if para) integrating to 2H each.

- The OAc's methyl group as a singlet at ~2.3 ppm.

So that would match option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H,s). But then, where is the Cl? Oh, Cl is on the ring and doesn't contribute to the NMR. So the molecule would have 6 aromatic H (but in this case, substituents are para, so 4 H in two doublets). Wait, no: benzene has six H, but two substituents would each take the place of one H. So in para substitution, each substituent is opposite each other, leading to two sets of two H each. So 2+2=4 H aromatic, but wait, that leaves two H missing. Hmm, that's not right. Wait, benzene has six H. If two substituents are para, then each substituent is at positions 1 and 3 or 1 and 4? Wait, noâ€”if para, substituents are at positions 1 and 4. Then, the remaining H are at positions 2,3,5,6? So that's four H. So in the NMR, you would have two doublets: each integrating to 2 H, as in option C. So that fits.

But wait, the ester group (OAc) would have a methyl group at 2.3 ppm. So the NMR would have those peaks. But the Cl substituent doesn't add any H. So the total H would be: aromatic (4 H) + OAc (3 H) =7 H. But the molecular formula would be C8H7ClO2. Which fits the 8 carbons (6 from benzene, 2 from OAc: OAc is O-CO-OCH3, but wait, no, OAc is O-CO-CH3, which is one more carbon from the CH3. Wait, benzene is 6 C, OAc is 2 C (CO and CH3?), Cl is 0 C. So total is 6 + 2 =8 C. So that fits.

So the NMR would have:

- Aromatic H: 4 H, split into two doublets at around 7.8 and 7.6 ppm.

- OAc CH3: 3 H singlet at ~2.3 ppm.

Which matches option C.

But wait, the IR in the question also mentions an aromatic-halogen bond. So the Cl is attached to the aromatic ring, which would show up in the aromatic region, but in the NMR, Cl doesn't have protons, so no signal. So the NMR would only show the OAc group and the aromatic H.

So option C seems to fit this scenario.

Wait, but earlier I thought option C's NMR only accounts for 7 H, but the actual molecule would have 6 (aromatic) + 3 (OAc) =9 H. Wait, no. Wait, benzene with two substituents (OAc and Cl) would have 6-2=4 H. Because each substituent replaces one H. So 4 aromatic H + 3 from OAc =7 H. So the NMR would have 7 H in total, which matches option C's integration (7 H: 2+2+3). So that's correct.

But wait, the substituents in option C would be OAc and Cl, but the question says the substituents are a carbonyl group and a halogen. OAc is a carbonyl group. So that fits.

But wait, let me check the options again. The question says the peaks indicate a carbonyl group (so the substituent must have a C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (so another substituent is Cl or Br, etc.). So substituents are OAc and Cl.

So option C's NMR would match that scenario.

But another possibility: substituent is a nitro group (NO2), but that doesn't have a carbonyl. Or a ketone group, like COCH3.

Wait, another thought: substituent could be a ketone, like in acetophenone. So substituents are COCH3 and Cl.

In that case, the aromatic H would be in a certain pattern. Let me think if that matches any option.

If substituents are COCH3 and Cl in para positions, then the aromatic H would be two doublets, as in option C. The COCH3's CH3 would be a singlet around 2.6 ppm. But in option C, the singlet is at 2.3. Hmm, that's a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is OAc.

Alternatively, if substituent is an aldehyde group (-CHO), then the aldehyde proton would appear as a singlet around 9.9 ppm. That would match option A.

But then, the substituents would be -CHO and Cl. So the NMR would have:

- Aldehyde H: 9.9 (1H, s).

- Aromatic H: as in option A, which is 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). So 4 aromatic H.

- Then, what's the 3.7 (2H, s)? A CH2 group? But where would that come from? Because substituents are -CHO and Cl. No CH2 groups.

So option A has an extra peak, which doesn't fit this structure. So perhaps option A isn't correct.

So, going back, the substituents are OAc and Cl. That would fit option C's NMR.

Wait, but another possibility is that the substituent is a methoxycarbonyl group, but I'm not sure.

So, I think option C is the correct one because:

- It has aromatic protons as two doublets (para substitution).

- The 2.3 ppm singlet is likely the methyl group of an acetyloxy substituent.

- The IR shows a carbonyl group and a halogen, which fits with OAc and Cl.

But wait, the question says the compound is di-substituted, which would mean two substituents. So OAc and Cl are the two substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group attached to a benzene ring as a substituent, such as a ketone group. For example, if the substituent is a -COCH2Cl group, but that would add more than two carbons, which doesn't fit the 8 C total.

Wait, another angle: considering the molecular formula.

If the substituents are Cl and COCH3, the molecular formula would be C8H7ClO.

So, for the 1H NMR:

- Aromatic H: 4 H (two doublets).

- COCH3: 3 H singlet.

Which totals 7 H. So the NMR integration adds up to 7 H, matching option C. But the actual molecule has 9 H (6 from benzene, 3 from COCH3), but wait, that can't be right. No, because two substituents replace two H on the benzene. So 6 - 2 =4 aromatic H, plus 3 from COCH3 gives 7 H total. So the NMR integration would sum to 7 H, but the molecular formula would have 8 C and 7 H plus Cl.

So the NMR in option C has four signals adding to 7 H, which fits.

But wait, in option C, the substituent is COCH3, then the peak would be at around 2.3 ppm. But in reality, the COCH3 group's CH3 is usually around 2.6 ppm. So why is the peak at 2.3 in option C?

Hmm, maybe it's a different substituent. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an acetyloxy group (OAc), which would have the CH3 at around 2.1 ppm. So 2.3 is a bit upfield, but possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl ketone, but the CH3 is at 2.3 ppm. That could vary based on the substitution patterns and electronic effects.

So, considering all this, I think option C is the correct answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with 8 carbon atoms in total. Since benzene contributes 6 carbons, the two substituents must account for the remaining 2 carbons. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond, meaning the substituents are likely a carbonyl-containing group (e.g., -COCH3 or -OAc) and a halogen (e.g., -Cl).

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A**:  
   - Peaks: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s).  
   - The singlet at 9.9 ppm suggests an aldehyde proton (-CHO), but the IR spectrum indicates a carbonyl group, not an aldehyde. Additionally, the peak at 3.7 ppm (2H, s) does not fit the expected substituents (-COCH3 or -OAc).  
   - **Conclusion**: Incorrect.

2. **Option B**:  
   - Peaks: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s).  
   - These peaks suggest a methylene group adjacent to an electronegative atom (e.g., oxygen) and a methyl group. However, this does not align with the expected substituents (a carbonyl group and a halogen).  
   - **Conclusion**: Incorrect.

3. **Option C**:  
   - Peaks: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s).  
   - The aromatic peaks at 7.8 and 7.6 ppm (2H, d each) suggest a para-substituted benzene ring. The singlet at 2.3 ppm (3H, s) corresponds to the methyl group of an acetyl group (-COCH3). The halogen (-Cl) does not contribute to the 1H NMR spectrum.  
   - **Conclusion**: Matches the expected structure of a para-substituted benzene with -COCH3 and -Cl.

4. **Option D**:  
   - Peaks: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s).  
   - The singlet at 6.9 ppm suggests an aromatic proton, but the peaks at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm indicate a methylene group adjacent to an electronegative atom, which does not match the expected substituents.  
   - **Conclusion**: Incorrect.

### Final Answer:
The correct 1H NMR data corresponds to a para-substituted benzene ring with a carbonyl group (-COCH3) and a halogen (-Cl). This matches the data in **Option C**.

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about an organic chemistry problem. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question says that there's a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms in total. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me break it down.

So, a 6-membered aromatic ring, like benzene, but di-substituted. Di-substituted means there are two substituents attached to the ring. The molecular formula probably has 8 carbons in total. Benzene has 6 carbons, so the two substituents combined add 2 more carbons. Because 6 (benzene) + 2 (substituents) = 8.

Wait, but substituents could be different. Wait, the substituents could be things like methyl groups or other groups. Oh, but waitâ€”wait, the question mentions that in the FTIR spectrum, there's a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. So the compound has both a carbonyl (like a ketone or ester or something with C=O) and a halogen attached to the aromatic ring.

So the two substituents on the benzene ring are a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen. Or wait, maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group, and the other is a halogen. Because di-substituted would mean two substituents on the benzene ring.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the possible structures. Let me consider the substituents. One substituent is a carbonyl group. But how can a benzene ring have a carbonyl group? Well, maybe it's a ketone attached as a substituent. Like, for example, acetophenone. But wait, acetophenone is a single substituent. Or perhaps the substituents are a carbonyl-containing group and a halide.

Wait, but the question says the compound is di-substituted. So two substituents are attached to the benzene ring. Each substituent could be something. Since one of them is a carbonyl group (like a ketone, maybe), and another is a halogen. Or perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl and the other is a halogen attached as another group.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps one substituent is an acyl group, like an ester or something, and another is a halogen. Or perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group and another substituent is an aryl group? No, that probably doesn't fit with the carbonyl and halogen in IR.

Wait, another thought: maybe the substituents are a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde) and a halogen (like Cl or Br) attached to the ring. So the benzene has two substituents: one is a carbonyl group (like a ketone), and another is a halogen.

But wait, another possibility is that one substituent is a group that includes both a carbonyl and a halogen. But that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group, and the other is a halogen attached directly to the ring.

Wait, but another possibility is that the substituents could be a carbonyl-containing group and another group that also has a carbonyl, but the halogen could be part of another substituent. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the molecular formula again.

The compound has 8 carbons in total. Benzene is 6 carbons. So the substituents add 2 carbons. So the two substituents must have a combined of 2 carbons. So each substituent could be a methyl group with something attached. For example, one substituent is a methyl ketone (like a propanone substituent?), but that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group (like O=C-R) and the other is a halogen.

But if the substituents are a carbonyl group (which would have more than one carbon, perhaps), wait, but their total is 2 carbons. Let me think: benzene has 6 carbons. So substituents are two groups adding 2 carbons. So each substituent must be a methyl group? No, because a methyl group is one carbon. Wait, if the substituents are a -CO- group, that would require more than one carbon. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are a halogen and a carbonyl-containing group. Let me think: benzene ring with two substituents. One substituent is a carbonyl group. Let's say substituent A is a carbonyl group, like -CO-R, but R has to be such that the total carbons are 8.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an acetyl group. So benzene with an acetyl group (which is two carbons: COCH3). Then, the other substituent would have to be zero carbons because 6 (benzene) + 2 (acetyl) = 8. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because 6 + substituents (each substituent adds some carbons). Oh, wait, substituents can be groups that have multiple carbons, but in this case, the total is 8, so the substituents must add up to 2. So if one substituent is a methyl group (1 carbon), the other must be another group with 1 carbon. But then, one substituent is a carbonyl group.

Wait, maybe one substituent is a methyl ketone group, like -COCH3, which would add two carbons (the CO and CH3). Then, the other substituent would have zero carbons. That can't be possible. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group (like -O=C-O-R), but that seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the substituents. If the benzene ring has two substituents, each must be a group that contributes to the carbons. The total is 8 carbons, so substituents sum to 2 carbons. So substituents must be two methyl groups, but then where's the carbonyl and halogen?

Wait, no. Because then, the substituents would be -CH3 and another group that's something else. But the FTIR shows a carbonyl. So substituents must include a carbonyl and a halogen. Let's think: if one substituent is -Cl and the other is -COCH3 (which is two carbons). So benzene with a Cl and a COCH3 group. Then, the total carbons would be 6 (benzene) + 1 (Cl doesn't add a carbon) + 2 (COCH3) = 9? Wait, no. Wait, benzene is 6 carbons, substituents are Cl (0 carbons) and COCH3 (2 carbons). So 6 + 0 +2 =8. Oh, that makes sense.

So the structure is benzene with a Cl and a COCH3 group attached. So it's a di-substituted benzene with substituents Cl and COCH3. Now, the question is about the 1H NMR spectrum.

The options are A, B, C, D.

Looking at each option:

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s). Hmm, a singlet at 9.9 is probably an aldehyde proton. But wait, if the substituent is COCH3, that's a ketone, not an aldehyde. So that's a problem. Unless the structure is different.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the substituent is an -O-CO-R group, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a nitro group, but that doesn't have a carbonyl in the NMR.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a carbonyl group in a different position.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl but in a different functional group, like an ester or something else.

Wait, if the substituent is COCH3 (an acetyl group), then the NMR would show a singlet for the CH3 attached to the carbonyl, but in option A, 3.7 ppm is a singlet for 2H, which would be a CH2 group, maybe. Hmm, but in COCH3, the CH3 would be around 2.6 ppm as a singlet. So option A's 3.7 (2H, s) doesn't fit. So maybe option A isn't the right one.

Option B: Peaks at 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s). These look like they could be from an ester group or a geminal di-substitution. Wait, 4.8 and 4.6 are around where CH2 groups attached to oxygen might appear. Maybe a methylene group adjacent to oxygen. The 1.3 (3H, s) is likely a methyl group attached to something. But how does this fit with the substituents?

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an acetyloxy group? Like OAc (O-CO-CH3). Then, the OCH2 groups would show up as two doublets around 4.6 and 4.8. But then, where is the Cl? Alternatively, the substituent is a carbonyl group attached to an oxygen, like an ester. But I'm not sure how that would fit with the di-substituted benzene.

Alternatively, the substituents could be a CH2CO group and a Cl. But that's getting complicated. Hmm. I'm not sure about option B.

Option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). The aromatic protons would suggest a para-substituted or some sort of coupling. The 2.3 ppm singlet for 3H is likely a methyl group attached to something deshielded, like a carbonyl. So maybe the substituent is a COCH3 group. Then, the aromatic protons would be in a particular pattern.

If the benzene is di-substituted with Cl and COCH3, their positions would determine the NMR. Let's say the two substituents are para to each other. Then, the aromatic protons would be two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So this matches option C: 7.8 (d, 2H) and 7.6 (d, 2H). The 2.3 ppm singlet is the COCH3 group. But where is the Cl? Wait, the Cl substituent would be on the ring, but it doesn't have any protons attached, so it won't show up in the 1H NMR. Oh wait, but the Cl is part of the substituent on the ring, but as a substituent itself, it doesn't have protons. So the 1H NMR wouldn't show the Cl, only the other substituent's protons.

But wait, if the substituent is Cl, that's a substituent on the benzene. So the substituents are Cl and COCH3. So in the NMR, you'd see the aromatic protons, the COCH3's methyl, and any other protons.

Wait, but in the structure, if the substituents are para to each other, then the aromatic protons would be two sets of two H each, each as doublets. So that's what option C shows: 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). The 2.3 ppm is the COCH3 (singlet, 3H). So all together, that would be 6 aromatic H (as 2 doublets), 3 H from COCH3. But wait, the total H would be 6+3=9? But the molecular formula must fit. Wait, the molecular formula is C8H? Let's see: benzene is C6H6. Each substituent, say, Cl is C0H1, and COCH3 is C2H3O. So total carbons: 6 + 0 (Cl) + 2 (COCH3) = 8. Hydrogens: benzene has 6 H. Cl substituent doesn't add any H. COCH3 substituent has 3 H. So total H is 6 + 3 =9. So molecular formula is C8H9ClO.

Wait, but looking at the NMR data for option C, the integration is 2H + 2H + 3H =7H. But the actual molecule has 9 H. Hmm, that seems off. So perhaps option C is not the right one. Or perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the substituents are not para. Maybe they're meta or ortho. Let me think about the di-substituted benzene.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are both attached in such a way that the aromatic protons are split into a certain pattern. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent with the carbonyl is an acetyl group, and the other substituent is a Cl. So the structure would be something like para-chloroacetophenone.

In that case, the aromatic protons would be in a certain pattern. For para substitution, the ring would have two sets of two protons each, each as doublets. So that's what option C has. So the aromatic signals would be 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d), which matches. And the COCH3 would be a singlet at around 2.3 ppm. So the NMR would have those three signals: 7.8, 7.6, and 2.3. But the integration in option C is 2H + 2H +3H=7H. But the molecule has 6 (benzene) +3 (COCH3) =9 H. So where are the other two H?

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Because option C only shows three sets of signals, but the molecule has more H. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in such a way that the aromatic H are split into more signals. Wait, if substituents are in the meta position, perhaps the aromatic protons would split into more peaks. But in that case, the di-substituted benzene would have more complex splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in the ortho position. Let me think: if the substituents are ortho, then the aromatic H would be adjacent to the substituents, which could cause more splitting. But I'm not sure about the exact pattern.

Wait, perhaps I should consider another possibility for the substituents. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group (like an ester) and the other is a halogen.

Wait, but the carbon count earlier suggests that the substituents are Cl and COCH3. So if that's the case, then the NMR should show the aromatic protons, the COCH3, and any other groups. But the option C only accounts for 7 H, but the molecule has 9 H. So something doesn't add up.

Wait, another thought: maybe the substituent is a carbonyl group attached to the ring as an acyl group, like a ketone. So the structure would be, say, benzophenone with a Cl substituent? Wait, no, that's a different structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl but in another position. Like, maybe a group like O-CO-CH3. But that would be an ester group, which would have more carbons.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl in a different place. Let me think: maybe the substituent is a formyl group (-CHO), which has one carbon. Then, the other substituent is a methyl group (but that would add another carbon). Wait, that would make substituents as -CHO and -CH3, but where's the halogen? Oh, wait, the IR shows a carbonyl (so the substituent is -CHO) and a halogen attached to the ring. So substituents are -Cl and -CHO. Then, the total carbons would be 6 (benzene) + 1 (CHO) + 1 (Cl doesn't add carbon) =8. So that fits.

So in this case, the substituents are -Cl and -CHO. So the structure would be chlorobenzaldehyde. But wait, then the NMR would have a peak for the aldehyde proton. The aldehyde proton is usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. So looking back at the options, option A has a peak at 9.9 ppm (1H, s). So that could fit.

In option A, the aromatic protons are at 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). The 3.7 ppm (2H, s) would be something else, but in the structure I'm considering (Cl and CHO), the substituents are Cl and CHO. So where would the 3.7 ppm peak come from? Maybe it's not from this structure, so maybe option A isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl ketone and a Cl, but in such a way that the NMR would have a peak at 3.7 ppm. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the substituents are a carbonyloxy group and a Cl. Like an ester group. For example, the substituent could be O-CO-R, where R is a methyl group. So the substituent would be OAc (acyloxy group). Then, the substituent would have a carbonyl and an oxygen.

In that case, the structure would be benzene with Cl and OAc substituents. The OAc group would have a methyl group attached to the carbonyl, which would show up as a singlet around 2.1 ppm. But looking at the options, option C has 2.3 ppm as a singlet for 3H, which could match that. But wait, option C's aromatic protons are 7.8 and 7.6, which would fit if the substituents are para.

Wait, but in that case, the substituents would be OAc and Cl. So the NMR would have:

- Aromatic protons as two doublets (if para) integrating to 2H each.

- The OAc's methyl group as a singlet at ~2.3 ppm.

So that would match option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H,s). But then, where is the Cl? Oh, Cl is on the ring and doesn't contribute to the NMR. So the molecule would have 6 aromatic H (but in this case, substituents are para, so 4 H in two doublets). Wait, no: benzene has six H, but two substituents would each take the place of one H. So in para substitution, each substituent is opposite each other, leading to two sets of two H each. So 2+2=4 H aromatic, but wait, that leaves two H missing. Hmm, that's not right. Wait, benzene has six H. If two substituents are para, then each substituent is at positions 1 and 3 or 1 and 4? Wait, noâ€”if para, substituents are at positions 1 and 4. Then, the remaining H are at positions 2,3,5,6? So that's four H. So in the NMR, you would have two doublets: each integrating to 2 H, as in option C. So that fits.

But wait, the ester group (OAc) would have a methyl group at 2.3 ppm. So the NMR would have those peaks. But the Cl substituent doesn't add any H. So the total H would be: aromatic (4 H) + OAc (3 H) =7 H. But the molecular formula would be C8H7ClO2. Which fits the 8 carbons (6 from benzene, 2 from OAc: OAc is O-CO-OCH3, but wait, no, OAc is O-CO-CH3, which is one more carbon from the CH3. Wait, benzene is 6 C, OAc is 2 C (CO and CH3?), Cl is 0 C. So total is 6 + 2 =8 C. So that fits.

So the NMR would have:

- Aromatic H: 4 H, split into two doublets at around 7.8 and 7.6 ppm.

- OAc CH3: 3 H singlet at ~2.3 ppm.

Which matches option C.

But wait, the IR in the question also mentions an aromatic-halogen bond. So the Cl is attached to the aromatic ring, which would show up in the aromatic region, but in the NMR, Cl doesn't have protons, so no signal. So the NMR would only show the OAc group and the aromatic H.

So option C seems to fit this scenario.

Wait, but earlier I thought option C's NMR only accounts for 7 H, but the actual molecule would have 6 (aromatic) + 3 (OAc) =9 H. Wait, no. Wait, benzene with two substituents (OAc and Cl) would have 6-2=4 H. Because each substituent replaces one H. So 4 aromatic H + 3 from OAc =7 H. So the NMR would have 7 H in total, which matches option C's integration (7 H: 2+2+3). So that's correct.

But wait, the substituents in option C would be OAc and Cl, but the question says the substituents are a carbonyl group and a halogen. OAc is a carbonyl group. So that fits.

But wait, let me check the options again. The question says the peaks indicate a carbonyl group (so the substituent must have a C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (so another substituent is Cl or Br, etc.). So substituents are OAc and Cl.

So option C's NMR would match that scenario.

But another possibility: substituent is a nitro group (NO2), but that doesn't have a carbonyl. Or a ketone group, like COCH3.

Wait, another thought: substituent could be a ketone, like in acetophenone. So substituents are COCH3 and Cl.

In that case, the aromatic H would be in a certain pattern. Let me think if that matches any option.

If substituents are COCH3 and Cl in para positions, then the aromatic H would be two doublets, as in option C. The COCH3's CH3 would be a singlet around 2.6 ppm. But in option C, the singlet is at 2.3. Hmm, that's a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is OAc.

Alternatively, if substituent is an aldehyde group (-CHO), then the aldehyde proton would appear as a singlet around 9.9 ppm. That would match option A.

But then, the substituents would be -CHO and Cl. So the NMR would have:

- Aldehyde H: 9.9 (1H, s).

- Aromatic H: as in option A, which is 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). So 4 aromatic H.

- Then, what's the 3.7 (2H, s)? A CH2 group? But where would that come from? Because substituents are -CHO and Cl. No CH2 groups.

So option A has an extra peak, which doesn't fit this structure. So perhaps option A isn't correct.

So, going back, the substituents are OAc and Cl. That would fit option C's NMR.

Wait, but another possibility is that the substituent is a methoxycarbonyl group, but I'm not sure.

So, I think option C is the correct one because:

- It has aromatic protons as two doublets (para substitution).

- The 2.3 ppm singlet is likely the methyl group of an acetyloxy substituent.

- The IR shows a carbonyl group and a halogen, which fits with OAc and Cl.

But wait, the question says the compound is di-substituted, which would mean two substituents. So OAc and Cl are the two substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group attached to a benzene ring as a substituent, such as a ketone group. For example, if the substituent is a -COCH2Cl group, but that would add more than two carbons, which doesn't fit the 8 C total.

Wait, another angle: considering the molecular formula.

If the substituents are Cl and COCH3, the molecular formula would be C8H7ClO.

So, for the 1H NMR:

- Aromatic H: 4 H (two doublets).

- COCH3: 3 H singlet.

Which totals 7 H. So the NMR integration adds up to 7 H, matching option C. But the actual molecule has 9 H (6 from benzene, 3 from COCH3), but wait, that can't be right. No, because two substituents replace two H on the benzene. So 6 - 2 =4 aromatic H, plus 3 from COCH3 gives 7 H total. So the NMR integration would sum to 7 H, but the molecular formula would have 8 C and 7 H plus Cl.

So the NMR in option C has four signals adding to 7 H, which fits.

But wait, in option C, the substituent is COCH3, then the peak would be at around 2.3 ppm. But in reality, the COCH3 group's CH3 is usually around 2.6 ppm. So why is the peak at 2.3 in option C?

Hmm, maybe it's a different substituent. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an acetyloxy group (OAc), which would have the CH3 at around 2.1 ppm. So 2.3 is a bit upfield, but possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl ketone, but the CH3 is at 2.3 ppm. That could vary based on the substitution patterns and electronic effects.

So, considering all this, I think option C is the correct answer.


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with 8 carbon atoms in total. Since benzene contributes 6 carbons, the two substituents must account for the remaining 2 carbons. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond, meaning the substituents are likely a carbonyl-containing group (e.g., -COCH3 or -OAc) and a halogen (e.g., -Cl).

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A**:  
   - Peaks: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s).  
   - The singlet at 9.9 ppm suggests an aldehyde proton (-CHO), but the IR spectrum indicates a carbonyl group, not an aldehyde. Additionally, the peak at 3.7 ppm (2H, s) does not fit the expected substituents (-COCH3 or -OAc).  
   - **Conclusion**: Incorrect.

2. **Option B**:  
   - Peaks: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s).  
   - These peaks suggest a methylene group adjacent to an electronegative atom (e.g., oxygen) and a methyl group. However, this does not align with the expected substituents (a carbonyl group and a halogen).  
   - **Conclusion**: Incorrect.

3. **Option C**:  
   - Peaks: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s).  
   - The aromatic peaks at 7.8 and 7.6 ppm (2H, d each) suggest a para-substituted benzene ring. The singlet at 2.3 ppm (3H, s) corresponds to the methyl group of an acetyl group (-COCH3). The halogen (-Cl) does not contribute to the 1H NMR spectrum.  
   - **Conclusion**: Matches the expected structure of a para-substituted benzene with -COCH3 and -Cl.

4. **Option D**:  
   - Peaks: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s).  
   - The singlet at 6.9 ppm suggests an aromatic proton, but the peaks at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm indicate a methylene group adjacent to an electronegative atom, which does not match the expected substituents.  
   - **Conclusion**: Incorrect.

### Final Answer:
The correct 1H NMR data corresponds to a para-substituted benzene ring with a carbonyl group (-COCH3) and a halogen (-Cl). This matches the data in **Option C**.
