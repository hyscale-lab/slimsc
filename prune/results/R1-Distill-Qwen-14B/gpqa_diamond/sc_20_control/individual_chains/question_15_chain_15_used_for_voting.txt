Alright, so I have this question about exoplanet transits and which one is more likely to transit. Hmm, okay, let me think. I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

Wait, the question says both planets have Earth-like masses. So their masses are the same. But their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has a shorter period—three times shorter than Planet_2. So Planet_1 is closer to its star since shorter period means closer orbit, right?

The host stars have different masses. The star for Planet_1 is twice as massive as Planet_2's host. But both stars have the same radii. Oh, interesting. So even though the star hosting Planet_1 is more massive, their radii are identical. How does that affect the transit probability?

I think the transit probability formula is something like (R_planet / R_star)^2 * (1/(1 - e²))^½, but wait, since both orbits are circular (e=0), that part drops out. So the probability simplifies to (R_planet / R_star)^2, but wait, no, that's the area. Wait, actually, the probability is about the orbital plane alignment. Oh right, the geometric probability for a transit is given by (R_star + R_planet)^2 / (a^2 - (R_star + R_planet)^2 ), or something like that. Wait, maybe I should recall the formula correctly.

Wait, the transit probability P is approximately (R_star / a) * (1/(sqrt(1 - e²))) ), but since the orbits are circular, e=0, so it's (R_star)/(a). But wait, that's not exactly the full story. I think the formula for the probability is P ≈ (R_star / a) * (something else?), but perhaps I should think in terms of the impact parameter and the area. Alternatively, I've heard that the probability is roughly (R_star / a), where a is the semi-major axis.

Wait, more accurately, the transit probability is the area of the star (circle) divided by the area of the planet's orbit (another circle, but with a much larger radius). So the probability is (π R_star^2) / (π a^2) ) = (R_star / a)^2. But wait, I think that's an approximation. The actual geometric probability is (R_star + R_planet)^2 / (a^2 - (R_star + R_planet)^2 ), but when R_planet is much smaller than R_star, this simplifies to roughly (R_star/a)^2 * (some factor). Alternatively, perhaps it's (R_star / a) * (something else).

Wait, maybe I should look up the exact formula. Oh wait, I can't look things up right now, but from what I remember, the probability is given by:

P ≈ (R_star / a) * (1/(sqrt(1 - e²))) )

But since e=0 here, it's just (R_star / a). But wait, that doesn't sound right because if a is much larger than R_star, the probability should be small. So maybe it's (R_star / a) * something else. Alternatively, another approach: the transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us. The probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the distance of the planet's orbit, times a correction factor.

Wait, I think the correct formula is P = (R_star + R_planet) / a * (1 / (1 - (R_star / a)^2 )) )^(1/2). Hmm, not sure. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the relative sizes.

Wait, perhaps the transit probability is proportional to (R_planet / a) * (R_star / a). Or wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, another approach: the transit probability depends on the ratio of the size of the star to the distance of the planet's orbit. Since both planets have similar sizes (Earth-like), the probability is proportional to (R_star / a). So if a is smaller, the probability is higher.

So for each planet, the probability is proportional to R_star / a.

Now, let's compute this for each planet.

We have:

Planet_1: host star mass is 2 times Planet_2's host. But both stars have same radius. So R1 = R2.

Orbital period: Planet_1's period is 3 times shorter than Planet_2's. So P1 = P2 /3.

We need to find the semi-major axis for each, using Kepler's third law.

Kepler's law: (a^3)/(P^2) = G(M_star)/(4π²). Since P is in days, but it's easier to express in terms of the proportionality.

We can write a^3 ∝ M_star * P².

Wait, the exact form is a³ = [G(M_star + m_planet) * P²] / (4π²). But since the planet mass is negligible compared to the star, a³ ≈ G M_star P² / (4 π²). So for a given system, a is proportional to (M_star * P²)^(1/3).

So for each planet:

a1³ ∝ M1 * P1²

a2³ ∝ M2 * P2²

Given M1 = 2 M2, P1 = P2/3.

So a1^3 ∝ 2 M2 * (P2² /9) ) = (2/9) M2 P2².

a2^3 ∝ M2 * P2².

So a1^3 / a2^3 = (2/9) M2 P2² / (M2 P2²) ) = 2/9.

So a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

Calculate (2/9)^(1/3). 2/9 is about 0.222. The cube root of 0.222 is approximately 0.6. Let me compute it more accurately.

Well, 0.6^3 = 0.216, which is about 2/9. So (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ 0.6. So a1 ≈ 0.6 a2.

So a1 is smaller than a2.

Now, the transit probability is proportional to R_star / a.

Since R1 = R2, the transit probability for Planet 1 is (R1 / a1) = R2/(0.6 a2) )= (1/0.6)*(R2/a2) ) ≈ 1.666 * (R2/a2).

Similarly, the probability for Planet 2 is (R2/a2).

So the ratio of probabilities is (P1/P2) = (R1/a1) / (R2/a2) )= (R2/(0.6 a2)) ) / (R2/(a2)) )= 1/0.6 ≈ 1.666.

So Planet_1 has about 1.666 times higher probability than Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers would prefer observing Planet_1, as it has a higher probability of transiting.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. 1.666 is approximately 1.65.

So the correct answer is C.

To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula. The probability is proportional to \( \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a} \), where \( R_{\text{star}} \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both planets have Earth-like masses and their host stars have the same radius (\( R_1 = R_2 \)), the key factor is the semi-major axis \( a \).

Using Kepler's third law, \( a^3 \propto M_{\text{star}} \cdot P^2 \), we calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes for Planet_1 and Planet_2. Given that \( M_1 = 2M_2 \) and \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \), we find:

\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{M_1 \cdot P_1^2}{M_2 \cdot P_2^2} = \frac{2M_2 \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{M_2 \cdot P_2^2} = \frac{2}{9}.
\]

Taking the cube root, \( \frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.6 \). Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.6a_2 \).

The transit probability is proportional to \( \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a} \). Since \( R_1 = R_2 \), the ratio of transit probabilities is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R_1}{a_1}}{\frac{R_2}{a_2}} = \frac{\frac{R_2}{0.6a_2}}{\frac{R_2}{a_2}} = \frac{1}{0.6} \approx 1.67.
\]

Therefore, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times higher transit probability than Planet_2. The researchers would prefer observing Planet_1.

So for each planet, the probability is proportional to R_star / a.

Now, let's compute this for each planet.

We have:

Planet_1: host star mass is 2 times Planet_2's host. But both stars have same radius. So R1 = R2.

Orbital period: Planet_1's period is 3 times shorter than Planet_2's. So P1 = P2 /3.

We need to find the semi-major axis for each, using Kepler's third law.

Kepler's law: (a^3)/(P^2) = G(M_star)/(4π²). Since P is in days, but it's easier to express in terms of the proportionality.

We can write a^3 ∝ M_star * P².

Wait, the exact form is a³ = [G(M_star + m_planet) * P²] / (4π²). But since the planet mass is negligible compared to the star, a³ ≈ G M_star P² / (4 π²). So for a given system, a is proportional to (M_star * P²)^(1/3).

So for each planet:

a1³ ∝ M1 * P1²

a2³ ∝ M2 * P2²

Given M1 = 2 M2, P1 = P2/3.

So a1^3 ∝ 2 M2 * (P2² /9) ) = (2/9) M2 P2².

a2^3 ∝ M2 * P2².

So a1^3 / a2^3 = (2/9) M2 P2² / (M2 P2²) ) = 2/9.

So a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

Calculate (2/9)^(1/3). 2/9 is about 0.222. The cube root of 0.222 is approximately 0.6. Let me compute it more accurately.

Well, 0.6^3 = 0.216, which is about 2/9. So (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ 0.6. So a1 ≈ 0.6 a2.

So a1 is smaller than a2.

Now, the transit probability is proportional to R_star / a.

Since R1 = R2, the transit probability for Planet 1 is (R1 / a1) = R2/(0.6 a2) )= (1/0.6)*(R2/a2) ) ≈ 1.666 * (R2/a2).

Similarly, the probability for Planet 2 is (R2/a2).

So the ratio of probabilities is (P1/P2) = (R1/a1) / (R2/a2) )= (R2/(0.6 a2)) ) / (R2/(a2)) )= 1/0.6 ≈ 1.666.

So Planet_1 has about 1.666 times higher probability than Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers would prefer observing Planet_1, as it has a higher probability of transiting.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. 1.666 is approximately 1.65.

So the correct answer is C.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula. The probability is proportional to \( \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a} \), where \( R_{\text{star}} \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both planets have Earth-like masses and their host stars have the same radius (\( R_1 = R_2 \)), the key factor is the semi-major axis \( a \).

Using Kepler's third law, \( a^3 \propto M_{\text{star}} \cdot P^2 \), we calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes for Planet_1 and Planet_2. Given that \( M_1 = 2M_2 \) and \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \), we find:

\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{M_1 \cdot P_1^2}{M_2 \cdot P_2^2} = \frac{2M_2 \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{M_2 \cdot P_2^2} = \frac{2}{9}.
\]

Taking the cube root, \( \frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.6 \). Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.6a_2 \).

The transit probability is proportional to \( \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a} \). Since \( R_1 = R_2 \), the ratio of transit probabilities is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R_1}{a_1}}{\frac{R_2}{a_2}} = \frac{\frac{R_2}{0.6a_2}}{\frac{R_2}{a_2}} = \frac{1}{0.6} \approx 1.67.
\]

Therefore, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times higher transit probability than Planet_2. The researchers would prefer observing Planet_1.
