Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which statement is incorrect about the products in this reaction sequence. Let me break it down step by step.

The starting compound is A, which is C3H6. That's probably propene because propene has the formula C3H6. So, propene is an alkene. Then, it undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride. Hmm, wait, bromination of an alkene usually refers to an addition reaction. The solvent CCl4 is often used in such reactions, so I think that's correct. So, when propene (CH₂=CH₂CH₃) reacts with bromine (Br2), it would undergo addition across the double bond. So compound B would be 1,2-dibromopropane, which is CH₂Br-CHBr-CH3? Or wait, maybe that's not right. Propene has three carbons; adding Br2 would add across the double bond. So for propene (CH₂=CH₂CH3), adding Br2 would make 1,2-dibromopropane. So that's B.

Next, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a base, and when a dibromide reacts with it, it usually undergoes elimination, forming an alkene. So B is 1,2-dibromopropane. When treated with alcoholic KOH, it would eliminate two equivalents of HBr, producing an alkene. The possible alkenes from 1,2-dibromopropane would be propene again, but wait, wait—no. Wait, when you eliminate from 1,2-dibromopropane, you can form either 1-propene or 2-propene. Wait, no, maybe that's not the case. Let me think: the structure of B is BrCH2CHBrCH3. So when eliminating, you lose HBr from adjacent carbons. So when the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2 or C2 and C3. Wait, but in this molecule, it's CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So the structure is CH2BrCHBrCH3. When you eliminate HBr from here, you can form either 1-propene (CH2=CHCH2Br?), no, wait. Alternatively, when you eliminate, you lose two HBr molecules, so the product is 1-propene or 2-propene? Wait, propene has three carbons. So eliminating from 1 and 2 would give a double bond between C1 and C2, making CH2=CHCH3. Alternatively, perhaps it's more likely to form the more substituted alkene due to Zaitsev's rule. So the major product would be 1-propene? Wait, no. Wait, 1-propene is CH2=CHCH3, which is actually the same as propene, which is the same as the starting material. Hmm, but wait, maybe I got the structure wrong. Alternatively, maybe the product is 2-pentene or something else, but wait, the starting material was C3H6, so the product after elimination should still be C3H6. So the product C would be propene again. Or wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is dehydrohalogenation, so perhaps the product is 1-propene. So compound C is propene.

Then, when compound C is passed through a red-hot iron tube, it produces compound D. Red-hot iron usually leads to dehydrogenation, perhaps. Wait, propene (CH2=CHCH3) when passed over iron would undergo dehydrogenation to form propyne (CH≡CCH3) or maybe another alkyne. Wait, no, propene has a double bond. On passing through red-hot iron, which is a catalyst for dehydrohalogenation or dehydrogenation. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation, but we don't have any halogens here. Oh wait, no, propene is CH2=CH2CH3, which is an alkene. When it passes through a red-hot iron tube, maybe it's a dehydrogenation reaction to form an alkyne. So propyne would be the product. So D is propyne, HC≡CCH2? No, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. Dehydrogenation would remove two H's, so CH≡CCH3? That's 1-propyne. So D is 1-propyne.

Next, compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form E. Hmm, two strong acids reacting with an alkyne. Maybe it's the reaction to form a diketone? Wait, no. Alternatively, acid-catalyzed hydration? Propyne (HC≡CCH3) could undergo hydroboration or acid-catalyzed hydration. Wait, acid-catalyzed hydration of alkynes usually gives ketones. But wait, with two strong acids, perhaps it's a different reaction. Wait, maybe it's the oxymercuration or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's the oxidation. Wait, another possibility is that D is an alkyne, and when treated with strong acids, it could undergo a dihydroxylation, but that usually requires specific conditions. Wait, or maybe it's a hydration reaction where the alkyne adds water to form a ketone. So, for propyne (HC≡CCH3), acid-catalyzed hydration would form propan-2-one (acetone), which is (CH3)2CO. So E would be acetone.

Then, compound E reacts with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid to form F. Iron in HCl... Oh, that sounds like a reaction where E undergoes a pinacol rearrangement or maybe a dehydration. Alternatively, maybe it's a Clemmensen reduction. Wait, Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and Fe. So, E is acetone. Clemmensen reduction reduces ketones to alkanes. So, acetone (propan-2-one) would be reduced to propane (CH3CH2CH3) via Clemmensen. But wait, wait, no, because Clemmensen requires a strong acid, like HCl, and iron as a catalyst. So F would be propane. Alternatively, maybe it's the Gattermann–Koch reaction, but that's for aldehydes. Alternatively, perhaps E is a ketone, so when reacted with HCl and Fe, it's a Birch reduction or something else. Wait, another thought: E is acetone, and reacting with HCl and Fe—I think the reaction is the reduction of the ketone to a methylene group. Wait, no, acetone is (CH3)2CO, which upon reduction would become (CH3)2CH2– but that's not possible. Wait, no, wait, the Clemmensen reduction reduces ketones to alkanes. So acetone would become propane (CH3CH2CH3). So F is propane.

Wait, but let me make sure. Clemmensen is for ketones and aldehydes, using Zn(Hg) and HCl, and Fe as a catalyst. So acetone would be reduced to propane. So F is propane, which is an alkane.

Then, F reacts with nitrous acid to form G. Nitrous acid (HNO2) typically reacts with alkanes? Wait, nitrous acid is used for diazotization, but that's usually with aromatic amines. Wait, but F is propane, an alkane. Hmm, wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me retrace.

Wait, maybe the reaction after E is with HCl and Fe, but perhaps it's a different kind of reaction. Alternatively, maybe E is a ketone, and when reacted with HCl and Fe, it's undergoing a different process. Another thought: Maybe E is a ketone, and F is an alcohol. Wait, no, but E is acetone, and F is from E in presence of HCl and Fe. Maybe it's a different reaction. Oh wait, wait—another possibility: maybe E is propionaldehyde, but no, earlier steps don't point to that. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I got the earlier steps wrong. Let me go back.

Original steps:

1. A is C3H6. So it's propene, CH2=CHCH3.

2. Bromination in CCl4: addition of Br2 to the double bond, giving 1,2-dibromopropane: CH2Br-CHBr-CH3.

3. Reaction with alcoholic KOH: elimination to form propene again, but wait, that can't be right because that would be the same as compound C. So perhaps I'm missing something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a trans addition. Wait, no, the structure would be the same.

Wait, but I'm not getting a different product. So C is propene again.

4. Passing through a red-hot iron tube: dehydrogenation to form propyne (HC≡CCH3).

5. Reacting with two strong acids to form E. Hmm, maybe the two strong acids are H2SO4 and H2O, so acid-catalyzed hydration of the alkyne. So propyne (HC≡CCH3) would add water to form propan-2-ol (CH3CHOHCH3) via acid catalysis. Wait, but wait, the hydration of an alkyne usually gives a ketone, not an alcohol. Because the alkyne adds water across the triple bond, but under different conditions. Wait, maybe with H2SO4 and H2O, the alkyne undergoes hydration to form a ketone. So E would be acetone (CH3COCH3).

Ah, I think that's correct.

Then, E (acetone) reacts with iron scrap and HCl to form F. So that's the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces the ketone to a methylene group. Wait, no, Clemmensen would convert a ketone to an alkane? Let me think: acetone (CH3)2CO → CH3CH2CH3 (propane) via Clemmensen. So F is propane.

Then, F is propane. Reacting with nitrous acid (HNO2). Wait, but propane is an alkane, and nitrous acid is more commonly used for aromatic diazotization. Oh wait, maybe F is CH3CH2CH3, and reacting with HNO2 would do nothing. Or maybe F is something else. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the previous steps.

Wait, maybe E is something else. Let me reevaluate step 5.

Wait, the alkyne D is propyne (HC≡CCH3). Reacting with two strong acids. What if the reaction is oxymercuration? But that's for alkynes? Alternatively, maybe it's the hydration to form a ketone, as I thought before.

So E is acetone. Then F is propane.

Then, F (propane) reacts with nitrous acid to form G. Hmm, but I don't think nitrous acid reacts with alkanes. So perhaps I made a mistake in identifying F.

Wait, perhaps the reaction after E is not the Clemmensen reduction. Let me think again.

E is acetone (CH3)2CO. So if E is treated with HCl and Fe, perhaps it's undergoing a different reaction. Wait, perhaps it's a hydrohalogenation, but acetone is a ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's a Birch reduction, but that typically requires Li or Na and NH3. Alternatively, maybe it's the Gattermann–Koch reaction, which converts aldehydes to ketones, but acetone is already a ketone.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a hydrohalogenation, but that's more for alkenes. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think: E is acetone. F is formed when E reacts with iron scrap and HCl. Oh! Wait, that's the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. So F is propane (CH3CH2CH3).

But then, F is propane. Reacting with nitrous acid (HNO2). Wait, that doesn't make sense. Propane is an alkane, and nitrous acid is a strong oxidizing agent, but I don't think it reacts with alkanes. That's confusing. What am I missing here?

Wait, perhaps I got an earlier step wrong. Let me think again about the reaction where D is formed.

D is formed by passing C through a red-hot iron tube. C is propene. So maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but C is an alkene, so perhaps it's dehydrogenation to make an alkyne. So D is propyne.

So D is propyne. Then, when D reacts with two strong acids to form E. Two strong acids: perhaps H2SO4 and H2SO3? Or maybe it's a hydroboration reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydration.

Wait, propyne is HC≡CCH3. When you hydrate it with H2O and H2SO4, you might get either ketone or maybe an aldehyde, but that depends on the conditions. Wait, the hydration of an alkyne (like propyne) can give a ketone. So in acidic conditions, propyne would hydrate to form acetone (CH3COCH3), so E is acetone.

Then, E (acetone) is treated with Fe and HCl to form F. That's the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces the ketone to propane. So F is propane.

Then, F (propane) reacts with nitrous acid to form G. But that doesn't make sense. Maybe I made a mistake in the identification of F.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps when D (propyne) reacts with two strong acids, it's a different reaction. Maybe it's a reaction to form an acid derivative. Or perhaps the two strong acids are for a different purpose. Alternatively, maybe it's a dihydroxylation, but that typically uses H2O2 and a catalyst like OsO4. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the hydration to form a different compound. Wait, another thought: if propyne is treated with concentrated H2SO4, it might form anhydrides, but that's not likely. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the reaction conditions. Maybe the two strong acids are H2SO4 and HNO3, but I'm not sure what reaction that would cause. Alternatively, maybe E is a diol or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction of D with two strong acids leads to an alkyne being converted into a ketone. So E is acetone, which is correct. Then F is propane. Then, when F (propane) is treated with nitrous acid, perhaps it's a different reaction. Alternatively, maybe G is nitropropane, but that doesn't fit. Wait, nitrous acid usually reacts with amines, not alkanes.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in F's identification. Let me think again. E is acetone. What reaction occurs when acetone is treated with Fe and HCl? Oh! Maybe it's the pinacol rearrangement, but that requires a vicinal diol. Wait, E is a ketone, so maybe F is a secondary alcohol, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction after E is a hydrolysis. Wait, but E is a ketone, so hydrolysis wouldn't change it. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Grignard reaction, but that requires Mg, not Fe.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about E. Maybe when D (propyne) reacts with two strong acids, it's a different pathway. Another reaction for alkynes under acidic conditions is the hydration to form ketones. So E is acetone. Then, F is from the reaction of acetone with Fe and HCl. So perhaps it's the Clemmensen reduction, giving propane. But then, reacting propane with nitrous acid doesn't make sense. So maybe I'm missing something here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction after E is not Clemmensen. Maybe E is something else.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the options to see if any clues are present.

The options are:

A) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.

B) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.

C) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.

D) C is a flammable gas.

So, let's evaluate each statement.

First, Option D: C is a flammable gas.

C is propene, which is a gas at standard temperature and is highly flammable. So D's statement is correct.

Option C: D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.

D is propyne (HC≡CCH3). The structure has a triple bond. The protons on the CH3 group are next to the triple bond. In NMR, the triple bond causes splitting due to the neighboring protons. Wait, in propyne, the structure is HC≡C-CH3. The CH3 group is adjacent to the triple bond. The protons on the CH3 group are a singlet because they are all equivalent and don't have neighboring protons. Wait, no, the CH3 is at the end, so their protons are all equivalent and not split by any adjacent protons. So the CH3 would be a singlet. The H on the other end (the sp-hybridized H) would also be a singlet because it has no neighboring protons. So the 1H NMR would show two singlets: one from the CH3 and one from the sp-hybrid H.

Thus, option C's statement is correct.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride solution.

H is formed when G reacts with sodium hydroxide. Let's see: G is formed when F reacts with nitrous acid. Hmm, so F is propane. Reacting with nitrous acid... Wait, I'm stuck again.

Wait, perhaps F is not propane. Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps E is propionaldehyde instead of acetone. Let's see: D is propyne. If D is reacted with a mixture of H2SO4 and H2O, perhaps it's a hydration to form propionaldehyde (CH3CH2CHO) instead of a ketone. Wait, but that's not correct because the hydration of an alkyne typically gives a ketone. Alternatively, maybe under different conditions, it could give an aldehyde. But I'm not certain.

If E were propionaldehyde (CH3CH2CHO), then F would be formed by the reaction with Fe and HCl. Wait, propionaldehyde has an aldehyde group. In that case, the reaction with Fe and HCl (maybe Clemmensen) would reduce the aldehyde to a primary alcohol. Wait, no, the Clemmensen reduces aldehydes to alkanes. So propionaldehyde would become propane (CH3CH2CH3). That brings us back to F being propane again.

Hmm. So perhaps I'm correct that F is propane, which doesn't react with nitrous acid to form G. Wait, but that would mean G is something else.

Wait, perhaps the reaction of F (propane) with nitrous acid is a typo, and it's actually reacting with HNO2 under acidic conditions. Wait, but I don't know what reaction that would be. Alternatively, perhaps F is not propane but something else.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about the reaction at step 6. Let me think: E is acetone (CH3)2CO. Reacting with Fe and HCl. Oh! Maybe it's a Grignard-like reaction, but I don't think so. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydroboration reaction, but that's usually with BH3. Alternatively, perhaps it's a halogenation. Wait, perhaps it's a reaction to form a secondary alcohol, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the ketone to a secondary alcohol. But that would require a different catalyst, like LiAlH4. But the question says iron and HCl. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Maybe E (acetone) is being treated with Fe and HCl to form a different compound. Maybe it's a hydrohalogenation, but acetone is a ketone, which doesn't react that way. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that requires aromatic rings. So I'm stuck again.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a benzene ring, but I don't see how. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction after E is the formation of a benzyl chloride or something else, but I can't connect it.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to proceed. Let's say F is propane. Then reacting with nitrous acid (HNO2) would produce G. But I don't know what that would be. Alternatively, maybe F is something else, like propanol.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the reaction of E. Let me think again: E is acetone. Reacting with iron and HCl (maybe under high pressure) could be the Clemmensen reduction, giving propane. So F is propane, which is an alkane. Then, G is formed when F (propane) reacts with nitrous acid. Hmm. I'm stuck again.

Perhaps I should move to the options and see what each statement implies.

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes.

If F is propane, then propane is a simple alkane and isn't used for dye synthesis. Alternatively, if F is something else, like benzene or a related compound, then it might be used in dye synthesis. But I don't see how F could be benzene in this sequence.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction sequence is different. Let me try another approach.

Starting over:

A is C3H6 → Propene.

Bromination in CCl4 → 1,2-dibromopropane.

Reaction with alcoholic KOH → elimination, forms propene (same as A). So C is propene.

Passing C through red-hot iron → dehydrogenation to form propyne (D).

D (propyne) reacts with two strong acids → forms E. Suppose the two strong acids are H2SO4 and H2O. The reaction would hydrate the alkyne to form acetone (E).

E (acetone) reacts with Fe and HCl → Clemmensen reduction to form propane (F).

F (propane) reacts with nitrous acid → I don't know. Maybe nothing? Or perhaps I made a mistake in F.

Wait, wait—maybe the reaction after E is not Clemmensen. Maybe it's a hydroboration reaction. Wait, but that would require BH3, not Fe and HCl. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Birch reduction, which uses Li and NH3, not Fe and HCl.

Alternatively, perhaps E (acetone) is reacted with HCl and Fe in another way. Maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but without an aromatic ring, that's not possible.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let's proceed with the assumption that F is propane.

Then, F (propane) reacts with nitrous acid to form G. But I don't know what this would be. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is with HNO2 under acidic conditions, producing something else. Wait, perhaps it's a hydroxylation? Or maybe it's a nitrosation. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution, but I don't see how.

Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong about F. Let me think again: E is acetone. Reacting with Fe and HCl—maybe the acetone is undergoing a different kind of reaction. Maybe it's a benzidine test or something else, but I don't think so.

Wait, another approach: perhaps after E is formed, the reaction with Fe and HCl is a hydrohalogenation. But acetone is a ketone and doesn't undergo that. So perhaps I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction after E is a Grignard reaction, but that would require Mg. So that's not the case.

Given that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look at the options again.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride solution.

H is formed when G reacts with NaOH. So if H is a compound that gives a yellow precipitate with FeCl3, it probably contains a phenolic OH group. Because phenols react with FeCl3 to form a colored complex (usually yellow or brown). So if H is phenol, then G would be a nitro compound or something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps option B is correct because H is phenol, which forms a yellow color with FeCl3.

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. If F is propane, that's not correct. But if F is benzene, which is used in dye synthesis, then A would be correct. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the reaction steps.

Wait, perhaps the reaction after E is different. Let me think: E is acetone. Reacting with Fe and HCl—could this be a coupling reaction? Or maybe a hydrolysis to form a glycol? Alternatively, perhaps it's a different reaction.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction after E is a hydrolysis under acidic conditions, but that wouldn't change a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps it's a condensation reaction, but that's unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is with HCl and Fe as a catalyst for some kind of substitution, but I'm not getting anywhere.

Given that I'm stuck, perhaps I should proceed with what I have and see which option is incorrect.

If all the steps are correct, then:

A) F is propane, which isn't used for dye synthesis. So A would be incorrect.

B) H is phenol, which reacts with FeCl3 to give a yellow color. So B is correct.

C) D (propyne) has two singlets in NMR: the CH3 and the sp-H. So C is correct.

D) C is propene, a flammable gas. So D is correct.

Therefore, the incorrect statement is A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. Because F is propane, which isn't used for that purpose. So the incorrect statement is A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction sequence begins with compound A (C₃H₆), identified as propene (CH₂=CHCH₃). Bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride adds Br₂ across the double bond, forming 1,2-dibromopropane (B). Reaction of B with alcoholic KOH eliminates two equivalents of HBr, regenerating propene (C). Passing C through a red-hot iron tube dehydrogenates the alkene to form propyne (D, HC≡CCH₃). 

When D reacts with two strong acids, it undergoes acid-catalyzed hydration to form acetone (E, (CH₃)₂CO). Reaction of E with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid reduces the ketone to propane (F, CH₃CH₂CH₃) via the Clemmensen reduction. Propane (F) reacts with nitrous acid (HNO₂), but this reaction does not proceed as alkanes do not typically react with nitrous acid. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A)** F is identified as propane, which is not used for the synthesis of dyes. This statement is incorrect.  
- **B)** H is formed when G reacts with sodium hydroxide. If G is a nitro compound, H could be a phenol derivative, which reacts with ferric chloride to give a yellow color. This statement is correct.  
- **C)** D (propyne, HC≡CCH₃) has two singlets in its ¹H NMR spectrum: one from the CH₃ group and one from the sp-hybridized H. This statement is correct.  
- **D)** C is propene, a flammable gas. This statement is correct.  

The incorrect statement is **A**, as propane is not used for dye synthesis.  

Answer: A

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which statement is incorrect about the products in this reaction sequence. Let me break it down step by step.

The starting compound is A, which is C3H6. That's probably propene because propene has the formula C3H6. So, propene is an alkene. Then, it undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride. Hmm, wait, bromination of an alkene usually refers to an addition reaction. The solvent CCl4 is often used in such reactions, so I think that's correct. So, when propene (CH₂=CH₂CH₃) reacts with bromine (Br2), it would undergo addition across the double bond. So compound B would be 1,2-dibromopropane, which is CH₂Br-CHBr-CH3? Or wait, maybe that's not right. Propene has three carbons; adding Br2 would add across the double bond. So for propene (CH₂=CH₂CH3), adding Br2 would make 1,2-dibromopropane. So that's B.

Next, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a base, and when a dibromide reacts with it, it usually undergoes elimination, forming an alkene. So B is 1,2-dibromopropane. When treated with alcoholic KOH, it would eliminate two equivalents of HBr, producing an alkene. The possible alkenes from 1,2-dibromopropane would be propene again, but wait, wait—no. Wait, when you eliminate from 1,2-dibromopropane, you can form either 1-propene or 2-propene. Wait, no, maybe that's not the case. Let me think: the structure of B is BrCH2CHBrCH3. So when eliminating, you lose HBr from adjacent carbons. So when the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2 or C2 and C3. Wait, but in this molecule, it's CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So the structure is CH2BrCHBrCH3. When you eliminate HBr from here, you can form either 1-propene (CH2=CHCH2Br?), no, wait. Alternatively, when you eliminate, you lose two HBr molecules, so the product is 1-propene or 2-propene? Wait, propene has three carbons. So eliminating from 1 and 2 would give a double bond between C1 and C2, making CH2=CHCH3. Alternatively, perhaps it's more likely to form the more substituted alkene due to Zaitsev's rule. So the major product would be 1-propene? Wait, no. Wait, 1-propene is CH2=CHCH3, which is actually the same as propene, which is the same as the starting material. Hmm, but wait, maybe I got the structure wrong. Alternatively, maybe the product is 2-pentene or something else, but wait, the starting material was C3H6, so the product after elimination should still be C3H6. So the product C would be propene again. Or wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is dehydrohalogenation, so perhaps the product is 1-propene. So compound C is propene.

Then, when compound C is passed through a red-hot iron tube, it produces compound D. Red-hot iron usually leads to dehydrogenation, perhaps. Wait, propene (CH2=CHCH3) when passed over iron would undergo dehydrogenation to form propyne (CH≡CCH3) or maybe another alkyne. Wait, no, propene has a double bond. On passing through red-hot iron, which is a catalyst for dehydrohalogenation or dehydrogenation. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation, but we don't have any halogens here. Oh wait, no, propene is CH2=CH2CH3, which is an alkene. When it passes through a red-hot iron tube, maybe it's a dehydrogenation reaction to form an alkyne. So propyne would be the product. So D is propyne, HC≡CCH2? No, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. Dehydrogenation would remove two H's, so CH≡CCH3? That's 1-propyne. So D is 1-propyne.

Next, compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form E. Hmm, two strong acids reacting with an alkyne. Maybe it's the reaction to form a diketone? Wait, no. Alternatively, acid-catalyzed hydration? Propyne (HC≡CCH3) could undergo hydroboration or acid-catalyzed hydration. Wait, acid-catalyzed hydration of alkynes usually gives ketones. But wait, with two strong acids, perhaps it's a different reaction. Wait, maybe it's the oxymercuration or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's the oxidation. Wait, another possibility is that D is an alkyne, and when treated with strong acids, it could undergo a dihydroxylation, but that usually requires specific conditions. Wait, or maybe it's a hydration reaction where the alkyne adds water to form a ketone. So, for propyne (HC≡CCH3), acid-catalyzed hydration would form propan-2-one (acetone), which is (CH3)2CO. So E would be acetone.

Then, compound E reacts with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid to form F. Iron in HCl... Oh, that sounds like a reaction where E undergoes a pinacol rearrangement or maybe a dehydration. Alternatively, maybe it's a Clemmensen reduction. Wait, Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and Fe. So, E is acetone. Clemmensen reduction reduces ketones to alkanes. So, acetone (propan-2-one) would be reduced to propane (CH3CH2CH3) via Clemmensen. But wait, wait, no, because Clemmensen requires a strong acid, like HCl, and iron as a catalyst. So F would be propane. Alternatively, maybe it's the Gattermann–Koch reaction, but that's for aldehydes. Alternatively, perhaps E is a ketone, so when reacted with HCl and Fe, it's a Birch reduction or something else. Wait, another thought: E is acetone, and reacting with HCl and Fe—I think the reaction is the reduction of the ketone to a methylene group. Wait, no, acetone is (CH3)2CO, which upon reduction would become (CH3)2CH2– but that's not possible. Wait, no, wait, the Clemmensen reduction reduces ketones to alkanes. So acetone would become propane (CH3CH2CH3). So F is propane.

Wait, but let me make sure. Clemmensen is for ketones and aldehydes, using Zn(Hg) and HCl, and Fe as a catalyst. So acetone would be reduced to propane. So F is propane, which is an alkane.

Then, F reacts with nitrous acid to form G. Nitrous acid (HNO2) typically reacts with alkanes? Wait, nitrous acid is used for diazotization, but that's usually with aromatic amines. Wait, but F is propane, an alkane. Hmm, wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me retrace.

Wait, maybe the reaction after E is with HCl and Fe, but perhaps it's a different kind of reaction. Alternatively, maybe E is a ketone, and when reacted with HCl and Fe, it's undergoing a different process. Another thought: Maybe E is a ketone, and F is an alcohol. Wait, no, but E is acetone, and F is from E in presence of HCl and Fe. Maybe it's a different reaction. Oh wait, wait—another possibility: maybe E is propionaldehyde, but no, earlier steps don't point to that. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I got the earlier steps wrong. Let me go back.

Original steps:

1. A is C3H6. So it's propene, CH2=CHCH3.

2. Bromination in CCl4: addition of Br2 to the double bond, giving 1,2-dibromopropane: CH2Br-CHBr-CH3.

3. Reaction with alcoholic KOH: elimination to form propene again, but wait, that can't be right because that would be the same as compound C. So perhaps I'm missing something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a trans addition. Wait, no, the structure would be the same.

Wait, but I'm not getting a different product. So C is propene again.

4. Passing through a red-hot iron tube: dehydrogenation to form propyne (HC≡CCH3).

5. Reacting with two strong acids to form E. Hmm, maybe the two strong acids are H2SO4 and H2O, so acid-catalyzed hydration of the alkyne. So propyne (HC≡CCH3) would add water to form propan-2-ol (CH3CHOHCH3) via acid catalysis. Wait, but wait, the hydration of an alkyne usually gives a ketone, not an alcohol. Because the alkyne adds water across the triple bond, but under different conditions. Wait, maybe with H2SO4 and H2O, the alkyne undergoes hydration to form a ketone. So E would be acetone (CH3COCH3).

Ah, I think that's correct.

Then, E (acetone) reacts with iron scrap and HCl to form F. So that's the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces the ketone to a methylene group. Wait, no, Clemmensen would convert a ketone to an alkane? Let me think: acetone (CH3)2CO → CH3CH2CH3 (propane) via Clemmensen. So F is propane.

Then, F is propane. Reacting with nitrous acid (HNO2). Wait, but propane is an alkane, and nitrous acid is more commonly used for aromatic diazotization. Oh wait, maybe F is CH3CH2CH3, and reacting with HNO2 would do nothing. Or maybe F is something else. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the previous steps.

Wait, maybe E is something else. Let me reevaluate step 5.

Wait, the alkyne D is propyne (HC≡CCH3). Reacting with two strong acids. What if the reaction is oxymercuration? But that's for alkynes? Alternatively, maybe it's the hydration to form a ketone, as I thought before.

So E is acetone. Then F is propane.

Then, F (propane) reacts with nitrous acid to form G. Hmm, but I don't think nitrous acid reacts with alkanes. So perhaps I made a mistake in identifying F.

Wait, perhaps the reaction after E is not the Clemmensen reduction. Let me think again.

E is acetone (CH3)2CO. So if E is treated with HCl and Fe, perhaps it's undergoing a different reaction. Wait, perhaps it's a hydrohalogenation, but acetone is a ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's a Birch reduction, but that typically requires Li or Na and NH3. Alternatively, maybe it's the Gattermann–Koch reaction, which converts aldehydes to ketones, but acetone is already a ketone.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a hydrohalogenation, but that's more for alkenes. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think: E is acetone. F is formed when E reacts with iron scrap and HCl. Oh! Wait, that's the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. So F is propane (CH3CH2CH3).

But then, F is propane. Reacting with nitrous acid (HNO2). Wait, that doesn't make sense. Propane is an alkane, and nitrous acid is a strong oxidizing agent, but I don't think it reacts with alkanes. That's confusing. What am I missing here?

Wait, perhaps I got an earlier step wrong. Let me think again about the reaction where D is formed.

D is formed by passing C through a red-hot iron tube. C is propene. So maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but C is an alkene, so perhaps it's dehydrogenation to make an alkyne. So D is propyne.

So D is propyne. Then, when D reacts with two strong acids to form E. Two strong acids: perhaps H2SO4 and H2SO3? Or maybe it's a hydroboration reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydration.

Wait, propyne is HC≡CCH3. When you hydrate it with H2O and H2SO4, you might get either ketone or maybe an aldehyde, but that depends on the conditions. Wait, the hydration of an alkyne (like propyne) can give a ketone. So in acidic conditions, propyne would hydrate to form acetone (CH3COCH3), so E is acetone.

Then, E (acetone) is treated with Fe and HCl to form F. That's the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces the ketone to propane. So F is propane.

Then, F (propane) reacts with nitrous acid to form G. But that doesn't make sense. Maybe I made a mistake in the identification of F.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps when D (propyne) reacts with two strong acids, it's a different reaction. Maybe it's a reaction to form an acid derivative. Or perhaps the two strong acids are for a different purpose. Alternatively, maybe it's a dihydroxylation, but that typically uses H2O2 and a catalyst like OsO4. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the hydration to form a different compound. Wait, another thought: if propyne is treated with concentrated H2SO4, it might form anhydrides, but that's not likely. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the reaction conditions. Maybe the two strong acids are H2SO4 and HNO3, but I'm not sure what reaction that would cause. Alternatively, maybe E is a diol or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction of D with two strong acids leads to an alkyne being converted into a ketone. So E is acetone, which is correct. Then F is propane. Then, when F (propane) is treated with nitrous acid, perhaps it's a different reaction. Alternatively, maybe G is nitropropane, but that doesn't fit. Wait, nitrous acid usually reacts with amines, not alkanes.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in F's identification. Let me think again. E is acetone. What reaction occurs when acetone is treated with Fe and HCl? Oh! Maybe it's the pinacol rearrangement, but that requires a vicinal diol. Wait, E is a ketone, so maybe F is a secondary alcohol, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction after E is a hydrolysis. Wait, but E is a ketone, so hydrolysis wouldn't change it. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Grignard reaction, but that requires Mg, not Fe.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about E. Maybe when D (propyne) reacts with two strong acids, it's a different pathway. Another reaction for alkynes under acidic conditions is the hydration to form ketones. So E is acetone. Then, F is from the reaction of acetone with Fe and HCl. So perhaps it's the Clemmensen reduction, giving propane. But then, reacting propane with nitrous acid doesn't make sense. So maybe I'm missing something here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction after E is not Clemmensen. Maybe E is something else.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the options to see if any clues are present.

The options are:

A) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.

B) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.

C) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.

D) C is a flammable gas.

So, let's evaluate each statement.

First, Option D: C is a flammable gas.

C is propene, which is a gas at standard temperature and is highly flammable. So D's statement is correct.

Option C: D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.

D is propyne (HC≡CCH3). The structure has a triple bond. The protons on the CH3 group are next to the triple bond. In NMR, the triple bond causes splitting due to the neighboring protons. Wait, in propyne, the structure is HC≡C-CH3. The CH3 group is adjacent to the triple bond. The protons on the CH3 group are a singlet because they are all equivalent and don't have neighboring protons. Wait, no, the CH3 is at the end, so their protons are all equivalent and not split by any adjacent protons. So the CH3 would be a singlet. The H on the other end (the sp-hybridized H) would also be a singlet because it has no neighboring protons. So the 1H NMR would show two singlets: one from the CH3 and one from the sp-hybrid H.

Thus, option C's statement is correct.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride solution.

H is formed when G reacts with sodium hydroxide. Let's see: G is formed when F reacts with nitrous acid. Hmm, so F is propane. Reacting with nitrous acid... Wait, I'm stuck again.

Wait, perhaps F is not propane. Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps E is propionaldehyde instead of acetone. Let's see: D is propyne. If D is reacted with a mixture of H2SO4 and H2O, perhaps it's a hydration to form propionaldehyde (CH3CH2CHO) instead of a ketone. Wait, but that's not correct because the hydration of an alkyne typically gives a ketone. Alternatively, maybe under different conditions, it could give an aldehyde. But I'm not certain.

If E were propionaldehyde (CH3CH2CHO), then F would be formed by the reaction with Fe and HCl. Wait, propionaldehyde has an aldehyde group. In that case, the reaction with Fe and HCl (maybe Clemmensen) would reduce the aldehyde to a primary alcohol. Wait, no, the Clemmensen reduces aldehydes to alkanes. So propionaldehyde would become propane (CH3CH2CH3). That brings us back to F being propane again.

Hmm. So perhaps I'm correct that F is propane, which doesn't react with nitrous acid to form G. Wait, but that would mean G is something else.

Wait, perhaps the reaction of F (propane) with nitrous acid is a typo, and it's actually reacting with HNO2 under acidic conditions. Wait, but I don't know what reaction that would be. Alternatively, perhaps F is not propane but something else.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about the reaction at step 6. Let me think: E is acetone (CH3)2CO. Reacting with Fe and HCl. Oh! Maybe it's a Grignard-like reaction, but I don't think so. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydroboration reaction, but that's usually with BH3. Alternatively, perhaps it's a halogenation. Wait, perhaps it's a reaction to form a secondary alcohol, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the ketone to a secondary alcohol. But that would require a different catalyst, like LiAlH4. But the question says iron and HCl. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Maybe E (acetone) is being treated with Fe and HCl to form a different compound. Maybe it's a hydrohalogenation, but acetone is a ketone, which doesn't react that way. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that requires aromatic rings. So I'm stuck again.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a benzene ring, but I don't see how. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction after E is the formation of a benzyl chloride or something else, but I can't connect it.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to proceed. Let's say F is propane. Then reacting with nitrous acid (HNO2) would produce G. But I don't know what that would be. Alternatively, maybe F is something else, like propanol.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the reaction of E. Let me think again: E is acetone. Reacting with iron and HCl (maybe under high pressure) could be the Clemmensen reduction, giving propane. So F is propane, which is an alkane. Then, G is formed when F (propane) reacts with nitrous acid. Hmm. I'm stuck again.

Perhaps I should move to the options and see what each statement implies.

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes.

If F is propane, then propane is a simple alkane and isn't used for dye synthesis. Alternatively, if F is something else, like benzene or a related compound, then it might be used in dye synthesis. But I don't see how F could be benzene in this sequence.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction sequence is different. Let me try another approach.

Starting over:

A is C3H6 → Propene.

Bromination in CCl4 → 1,2-dibromopropane.

Reaction with alcoholic KOH → elimination, forms propene (same as A). So C is propene.

Passing C through red-hot iron → dehydrogenation to form propyne (D).

D (propyne) reacts with two strong acids → forms E. Suppose the two strong acids are H2SO4 and H2O. The reaction would hydrate the alkyne to form acetone (E).

E (acetone) reacts with Fe and HCl → Clemmensen reduction to form propane (F).

F (propane) reacts with nitrous acid → I don't know. Maybe nothing? Or perhaps I made a mistake in F.

Wait, wait—maybe the reaction after E is not Clemmensen. Maybe it's a hydroboration reaction. Wait, but that would require BH3, not Fe and HCl. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Birch reduction, which uses Li and NH3, not Fe and HCl.

Alternatively, perhaps E (acetone) is reacted with HCl and Fe in another way. Maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but without an aromatic ring, that's not possible.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let's proceed with the assumption that F is propane.

Then, F (propane) reacts with nitrous acid to form G. But I don't know what this would be. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is with HNO2 under acidic conditions, producing something else. Wait, perhaps it's a hydroxylation? Or maybe it's a nitrosation. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution, but I don't see how.

Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong about F. Let me think again: E is acetone. Reacting with Fe and HCl—maybe the acetone is undergoing a different kind of reaction. Maybe it's a benzidine test or something else, but I don't think so.

Wait, another approach: perhaps after E is formed, the reaction with Fe and HCl is a hydrohalogenation. But acetone is a ketone and doesn't undergo that. So perhaps I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction after E is a Grignard reaction, but that would require Mg. So that's not the case.

Given that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look at the options again.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride solution.

H is formed when G reacts with NaOH. So if H is a compound that gives a yellow precipitate with FeCl3, it probably contains a phenolic OH group. Because phenols react with FeCl3 to form a colored complex (usually yellow or brown). So if H is phenol, then G would be a nitro compound or something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps option B is correct because H is phenol, which forms a yellow color with FeCl3.

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. If F is propane, that's not correct. But if F is benzene, which is used in dye synthesis, then A would be correct. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the reaction steps.

Wait, perhaps the reaction after E is different. Let me think: E is acetone. Reacting with Fe and HCl—could this be a coupling reaction? Or maybe a hydrolysis to form a glycol? Alternatively, perhaps it's a different reaction.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction after E is a hydrolysis under acidic conditions, but that wouldn't change a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps it's a condensation reaction, but that's unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is with HCl and Fe as a catalyst for some kind of substitution, but I'm not getting anywhere.

Given that I'm stuck, perhaps I should proceed with what I have and see which option is incorrect.

If all the steps are correct, then:

A) F is propane, which isn't used for dye synthesis. So A would be incorrect.

B) H is phenol, which reacts with FeCl3 to give a yellow color. So B is correct.

C) D (propyne) has two singlets in NMR: the CH3 and the sp-H. So C is correct.

D) C is propene, a flammable gas. So D is correct.

Therefore, the incorrect statement is A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. Because F is propane, which isn't used for that purpose. So the incorrect statement is A.


The reaction sequence begins with compound A (C₃H₆), identified as propene (CH₂=CHCH₃). Bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride adds Br₂ across the double bond, forming 1,2-dibromopropane (B). Reaction of B with alcoholic KOH eliminates two equivalents of HBr, regenerating propene (C). Passing C through a red-hot iron tube dehydrogenates the alkene to form propyne (D, HC≡CCH₃). 

When D reacts with two strong acids, it undergoes acid-catalyzed hydration to form acetone (E, (CH₃)₂CO). Reaction of E with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid reduces the ketone to propane (F, CH₃CH₂CH₃) via the Clemmensen reduction. Propane (F) reacts with nitrous acid (HNO₂), but this reaction does not proceed as alkanes do not typically react with nitrous acid. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A)** F is identified as propane, which is not used for the synthesis of dyes. This statement is incorrect.  
- **B)** H is formed when G reacts with sodium hydroxide. If G is a nitro compound, H could be a phenol derivative, which reacts with ferric chloride to give a yellow color. This statement is correct.  
- **C)** D (propyne, HC≡CCH₃) has two singlets in its ¹H NMR spectrum: one from the CH₃ group and one from the sp-hybridized H. This statement is correct.  
- **D)** C is propene, a flammable gas. This statement is correct.  

The incorrect statement is **A**, as propane is not used for dye synthesis.  

Answer: A
