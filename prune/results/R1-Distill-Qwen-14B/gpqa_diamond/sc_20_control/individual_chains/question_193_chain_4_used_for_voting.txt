Okay, so I've got this astronomy question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question is about. Hmm. It says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Oh wait, parallax is usually denoted as 'p' sometimes, but here they used plx, I guess that's just the symbol they're using.

So the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. The options are about the relationship between the number of stars and distance r. The options are like r cubed, r fifth, r fourth, r squared. 

I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I think is that distance (in parsecs) is equal to 1 divided by the parallax (in arcseconds). So distance r = 1 / plx. 

The question says the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. So let's write that down. N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But since r = 1/plx, I can substitute that into the equation. Let's see, plx is 1/r, so 1/plx would be r. Wait, no: plx = 1/r, so 1/plx is r. Wait, no: if plx is in arcseconds, then r in parsecs is 1/plx. So plx is 1/r, so 1/(plx) is r. 

So plx = 1/r. So substituting into the expression for N. N ∝ 1/(plx)^5 = 1/( (1/r) )^5. Because plx is 1/r, so (plx)^5 is (1/r)^5. So 1/(1/r)^5 is the same as r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. 

Wait, but that's not possible because as distance increases, the number of stars you can see should decrease, right? Because stars are farther away. But according to this, N would increase with r^5, which doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, the number of stars is varying as 1/plx^5. So N = k / plx^5. Since plx is 1/r, then N = k * (r)^5. So N is proportional to r^5. So as r increases, the number of stars increases. That seems counterintuitive because when you look farther away, you can't see as many stars, right? Because they're dimmer and maybe our telescopes can't detect them. Hmm, but maybe the question is about a specific region, not about the entire sky. So perhaps in this region, the number of stars actually increases with distance? That's odd, but perhaps if the region is such that more stars are born at larger distances, but that's a stretch. 

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again. "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." So when plx is larger, the number of stars is smaller. Because 1 over a big number is small. So when parallax increases, which happens when distance is small (since plx = 1/r), then N increases. Wait, no. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So if plx is small, the star is far away. So if plx is small, 1/plx^5 is large. So when distance is big (r is big), plx is small, so N is higher. So the number of stars increases with distance, which is a bit strange, but perhaps it's a hypothetical scenario. 

But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So the dependence is N ∝ r^5, which would mean that the answer is option B, ~ r^5. 

Wait, but let me double-check. Let's think about the change in N per unit distance. Because the question says, how does the number of stars change with distance, per unit range. So maybe they're asking about the number density as a function of distance. Or perhaps the number of stars in a shell between r and r+dr. 

Wait, but the question says "the number of stars in that region of the sky". So perhaps the region is a thin slice, and as you go to larger distances, the number of stars in that slice varies. So N ∝ r^5, meaning that as you go further, the number in each slice increases rapidly. But that's a bit odd because usually, the number of stars in a volume element (like a shell) depends on the volume, which depends on r^2 dr. But this is not a volume; it's a surface density perhaps? Or maybe it's about the number per unit area per unit distance. 

Wait, maybe the actual relation is about the number per unit distance, so the number density. But I'm not sure. Let me think: the number of stars per unit area (surface density) at a distance r would depend on how many stars are at that distance. If the number per unit distance is N(r) dr, then N(r) dr is proportional to r^5 dr. So the number per unit distance would be proportional to r^5. So the correct answer would be option B, ~ r^5. 

But wait, another approach. The initial relation is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/r, so 1/plx = r. So N ∝ r^5. So yes, the number of stars increases as r^5, which is option B. 

So I think the correct answer is B.

The question states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely related to distance (\( r \)) as \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \). Substituting this into the given relationship, we find:

\[
N \propto \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)^5} = r^5.
\]

This means the number of stars is proportional to \( r^5 \), indicating that the number of stars increases rapidly with distance. While this result seems counterintuitive in the context of observing stars (where one might expect fewer stars at greater distances due to their faintness), the question appears to describe a hypothetical scenario where the number of stars increases with distance. 

Thus, the correct answer is that the number of stars in the region of the sky changes with distance as \( r^5 \).
