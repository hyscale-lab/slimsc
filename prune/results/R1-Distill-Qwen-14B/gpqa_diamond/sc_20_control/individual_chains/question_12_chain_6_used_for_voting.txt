Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a certain decay process. Let's see what I can remember and figure out.

The problem states that a Pi(+) meson is at rest and decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino. The reaction is Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu. The rest masses given are Pi(+) at 139.6 MeV and mu(+) at 105.7 MeV. The neutrino's mass is probably negligible, as I remember neutrinos have very tiny masses, sometimes approximated as zero in such problems.

Wait, so the Pi is at rest, so the initial momentum is zero. Since momentum must be conserved, the total momentum of the products must also be zero. That means the muon and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta.

But wait, neutrinos are leptons, right, and in decay processes like this, they carry away energy and momentum. But since the Pi is at rest, the products must move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.

Now, I need to find the kinetic energies of the mu(+) and the neutrino. Since the neutrino's mass is so small, maybe I can treat it as massless. So the energy of the neutrino would be equal to its momentum times c, but I'll think about units later.

The rest mass of the Pi is 139.6 MeV. The mu is 105.7 MeV. So the mass of the neutrino is almost zero, so maybe I can ignore it. So the total energy of the decay products must equal the rest energy of the Pi, since the Pi was at rest.

Wait, the rest energy of the Pi is m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV. So the sum of the energies of the mu and the neutrino should be 139.6 MeV. But each of their energies is their rest energy plus kinetic energy. Hmm.

Wait, but the neutrino's rest energy is negligible, so its total energy is just kinetic energy plus a tiny bit, but maybe we can model it as E_nu = p_nu c. And similarly for the muon, E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ). But I'm getting a bit confused with the units. Let me think about this without getting into the weeds of unit conversions, since the problem gives everything in MeV.

Since momentum is conserved, p_mu = -p_nu. So their magnitudes are equal. Let me denote the magnitude as p. So the mu has momentum p in one direction, the neutrino p in the opposite.

So the energy of the mu is sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2? Wait, no, the energy E is given by E^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2. So E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2? Wait, no, units are a bit tricky here, but perhaps I can work in units where c=1, which is common in particle physics.

If I set c=1, then E^2 = p^2 + m^2. So the muon's energy is sqrt(p² + m_mu²), and the neutrino's energy is p (since m_nu is zero). So the sum of the two energies is the energy of the Pi, which is m_pi (since m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV, and with c=1, m_pi is 139.6 MeV).

So the equation becomes:

sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p = m_pi.

Let me plug in the numbers. m_mu is 105.7 MeV, m_pi is 139.6 MeV. So the equation is:

sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6.

Hmm, I need to solve for p. Let's denote p as x.

So sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2) + x = 139.6.

Let me subtract x from both sides:

sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2) = 139.6 - x.

Now square both sides:

x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2.

Expanding the right side:

(139.6)^2 - 2 * 139.6 * x + x².

So:

x² + 105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2*139.6 x + x^2.

Hmm, I can subtract x^2 from both sides. So:

105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2*139.6 x.

Now rearrange terms:

2*139.6 x = 139.6^2 - 105.7^2.

Compute the right side. Let me calculate 139.6^2 and 105.7^2.

139.6 squared: Hmm, 140^2 is 19600, but 139.6 is 0.4 less. So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + (0.4)^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

But wait, actually 139.6^2 is (139.6)^2 = let me compute it more accurately:

139.6 * 139.6. Let's compute 140 * 139.6 = 19544. Then subtract 0.4 * 139.6. So 19544 - (0.4 * 139.6) = 19544 - 55.84 = 19488.16 MeV².

Similarly, 105.7^2: 100^2 is 10000, 5.7^2 is 32.49, and cross terms 2*100*5.7 = 1140. So 105.7² = (100 +5.7)^2 = 100^2 + 2*100*5.7 +5.7^2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49 MeV².

So 139.6^2 - 105.7^2 = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67 MeV².

So,

2 * 139.6 * x = 8315.67.

So x = 8315.67 / (2 * 139.6) ?

Compute denominator: 2 * 139.6 = 279.2.

So x = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ Let me compute this.

Calculate 8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

Well, 279.2 * 30 is 8376, which is a bit higher than 8315.67. So 29.8? Let's see: 279.2 * 29 = 8100 - no, wait: 279.2 * 29 = (279.2 *30) - 279.2 = 8376 - 279.2 = 8096.8. Hmm, 8096.8 is less than 8315.67.

The difference is 8315.67 -8096.8= 218.87.

So 218.87 is how much more than 29 times.

So 218.87 ÷279.2 ≈ 0.782.

So x≈29.782.

So x≈29.78 MeV/c units? Wait, but in units where c=1, the units are just MeV, but p is in units of MeV/c, or perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Hmm, maybe better not to think about units right now.

So p ≈29.78 MeV/c. Wait, but that probably doesn't matter for calculating the kinetic energies.

Wait, the energy of the muon is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) since E²=p² + m² when c=1.

So E_mu = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Compute (29.78)^2: approx 887. Because 30^2=900, so 29.78^2 ≈ ~886.6.

So 886.6 + 11172.49 (since m_mu squared is 105.7^2=11172.49) is 12059.09.

So sqrt(12059.09) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

Wait, but the initial energy of the Pi is 139.6 MeV. So the neutrino's energy is p, which is 29.78 MeV. So E_mu is 109.81 MeV.

But the rest mass of the muon is 105.7 MeV, so the kinetic energy (KE) is E_mu - m_mu = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 MeV.

The neutrino's KE is p, which is 29.78 MeV.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: 2.84, 26.8

Option B:7.2,32.8

Option C:3.52,20.8

Option D:4.12,29.8.

Wait, I got mu KE as ~4.11 MeV, and neutrino KE ~29.78 MeV. So that would match option D: 4.12 and 29.8.

Wait, but wait a second. The neutrino's KE is p*c? But I assumed c=1, so p is in MeV/c, and E is in MeV. So the neutrino's energy is p*c, but when c=1, E=pc, so p = E/c. Wait, but in units where c=1, E=pc, so p = E. So in that case, the neutrino's energy is p, which is around 29.78 MeV, which is its KE because its rest mass is zero.

So the muon's KE is about 4.11 MeV, and the neutrino's KE is about 29.78 MeV. So the pair is (4.11, 29.78), which is closest to option D's 4.12 and 29.8.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because sometimes when you set c=1, you can get confused about the terms. Alternatively, perhaps I should do the calculation without assuming c=1, but that's more complicated. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach. The total energy available is the rest energy of the Pi, which is 139.6 MeV. The muon's rest energy is 105.7 MeV, so the maximum possible KE the muon can have is 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV. But in reality, the muon can't take all of this because the neutrino also takes some energy.

Wait, in our calculation, the muon's KE was about 4.11, and the neutrino's about 29.78, which adds up to about 33.89, which is the total energy available beyond the muon's rest mass. Hmm, that makes sense.

Wait, but another way to compute: The sum of the kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino plus their rest mass energies should equal the Pi's rest energy. The neutrino's rest mass is zero, so:

KE_mu + m_mu*c^2 + KE_nu = m_pi*c^2.

Wait, but in our earlier approach, the sum of E_mu and E_nu equals m_pi*c^2.

E_mu = KE_mu + m_mu*c^2.

E_nu = KE_nu (since m_nu is negligible).

So E_mu + E_nu = m_pi*c^2.

Which is (KE_mu + m_mu) + KE_nu = m_pi.

So KE_mu + KE_nu = m_pi - m_mu = 139.6 -105.7 = 33.9 MeV.

So the sum of the KEs should be 33.9 MeV.

Looking at the options, option D's KEs are 4.12 and 29.8, adding up to 33.92, which is about 33.9. That's a good check.

So the correct answer should be D.

The problem involves the decay of a stationary π⁺ meson into a μ⁺ muon and a neutrino, with the goal of finding the kinetic energies of the products. The rest masses of the π⁺ and μ⁺ are given as 139.6 MeV and 105.7 MeV, respectively, and the neutrino's mass is approximated as zero.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Conservation of Energy**: The total energy of the products must equal the rest energy of the π⁺, which is 139.6 MeV. This energy is distributed between the rest energy of the μ⁺ and the kinetic energies of the μ⁺ and the neutrino.

2. **Conservation of Momentum**: Since the π⁺ is stationary, the total momentum of the products must be zero. This implies that the magnitudes of the momenta of the μ⁺ and the neutrino are equal and opposite.

3. **Energy of the μ⁺**: The total energy of the μ⁺ is given by \( E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} \), where \( p \) is the magnitude of the momentum of the μ⁺, and \( m_{\mu} \) is its rest mass. The neutrino's energy is simply \( E_{\nu} = p \), as its rest mass is negligible.

4. **Energy Conservation Equation**: The total energy of the system is:
   \[
   E_{\mu} + E_{\nu} = m_{\pi}
   \]
   Substituting \( E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} \) and \( E_{\nu} = p \), the equation becomes:
   \[
   \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} + p = m_{\pi}
   \]
   Solving for \( p \), we substitute \( m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \):
   \[
   \sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} + p = 139.6
   \]
   Subtracting \( p \) from both sides and squaring:
   \[
   p^2 + 105.7^2 = (139.6 - p)^2
   \]
   Expanding and simplifying:
   \[
   p^2 + 11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2p + p^2
   \]
   \[
   279.2p = 19488.16 - 11172.49
   \]
   \[
   p = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}
   \]

5. **Kinetic Energies**:
   - The kinetic energy of the μ⁺ is:
     \[
     KE_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} - m_{\mu}
     \]
     Substituting \( p = 29.78 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \):
     \[
     KE_{\mu} = \sqrt{29.78^2 + 105.7^2} - 105.7 \approx 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}
     \]
   - The kinetic energy of the neutrino is:
     \[
     KE_{\nu} = p \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}
     \]

6. **Verification**: The total kinetic energy of the products is:
   \[
   KE_{\mu} + KE_{\nu} = 4.11 + 29.78 \approx 33.89 \, \text{MeV}
   \]
   This matches the total energy available after accounting for the μ⁺'s rest mass, confirming the calculations.

### Conclusion:
The kinetic energies of the μ⁺ and the neutrino are approximately 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, respectively. This matches **Option D**.

Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a certain decay process. Let's see what I can remember and figure out.

The problem states that a Pi(+) meson is at rest and decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino. The reaction is Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu. The rest masses given are Pi(+) at 139.6 MeV and mu(+) at 105.7 MeV.

The rest mass of the Pi is 139.6 MeV. The mu is 105.7 MeV. So the mass of the neutrino is almost zero, so maybe I can ignore it. So the total energy of the decay products must equal the rest energy of the Pi, since the Pi was at rest.

Wait, the rest energy of the Pi is m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV. So the sum of the energies of the mu and the neutrino should be 139.6 MeV. But each of their energies is their rest energy plus kinetic energy. Hmm.

Wait, but the neutrino's rest energy is negligible, so its total energy is just kinetic energy plus a tiny bit, but maybe we can model it as E_nu = p_nu c. And similarly for the muon, E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ). But I'm getting a bit confused with the units. Let me think about this without getting into the weeds of unit conversions, since the problem gives everything in MeV.

Since momentum is conserved, p_mu = -p_nu. So their magnitudes are equal. Let me denote the magnitude as p. So the mu has momentum p in one direction, the neutrino p in the opposite.

So the energy of the mu is sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2? Wait, no, the energy E is given by E^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2. So E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2? Wait, no, units are a bit tricky here, but perhaps I can work in units where c=1, which is common in particle physics.

If I set c=1, then E^2 = p^2 + m^2. So the muon's energy is sqrt(p² + m_mu²), and the neutrino's energy is p (since m_nu is zero). So the sum of the two energies is the energy of the Pi, which is m_pi (since m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV, and with c=1, m_pi is 139.6 MeV).

So the equation becomes:

sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p = m_pi.

Let me plug in the numbers. m_mu is 105.7 MeV, m_pi is 139.6 MeV. So the equation is:

sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6.

Hmm, I need to solve for p. Let's denote p as x.

So sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2) + x = 139.6.

Let me subtract x from both sides:

sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2) = 139.6 - x.

Now square both sides:

x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2.

Expanding the right side:

(139.6)^2 - 2 * 139.6 * x + x².

So:

x² + 105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2*139.6 x + x^2.

Hmm, I can subtract x^2 from both sides. So:

105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2*139.6 x.

Now rearrange terms:

2*139.6 x = 139.6^2 - 105.7^2.

Compute the right side. Let me calculate 139.6^2 and 105.7^2.

139.6 squared: Hmm, 140^2 is 19600, but 139.6 is 0.4 less. So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + (0.4)^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

But wait, actually 139.6^2 is (139.6)^2 = let me compute it more accurately:

139.6 * 139.6. Let's compute 140 * 139.6 = 19544. Then subtract 0.4 * 139.6. So 19544 - (0.4 * 139.6) = 19544 - 55.84 = 19488.16 MeV².

Similarly, 105.7^2: 100^2 is 10000, 5.7^2 is 32.49, and cross terms 2*100*5.7 = 1140. So 105.7² = (100 +5.7)^2 = 100^2 + 2*100*5.7 +5.7^2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49 MeV².

So 139.6^2 - 105.7^2 = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67 MeV².

So,

2 * 139.6 * x = 8315.67.

So x = 8315.67 / (2 * 139.6) ?

Compute denominator: 2 * 139.6 = 279.2.

So x = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ Let me compute this.

Calculate 8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

Well, 279.2 * 30 is 8376, which is a bit higher than 8315.67. So 29.8? Let's see: 279.2 * 29 = 8100 - no, wait: 279.2 * 29 = (279.2 *30) - 279.2 = 8376 - 279.2 = 8096.8. Hmm, 8096.8 is less than 8315.67.

The difference is 8315.67 -8096.8= 218.87.

So 218.87 is how much more than 29 times.

So 218.87 ÷279.2 ≈ 0.782.

So x≈29.782.

So x≈29.78 MeV/c units? Wait, but in units where c=1, the units are just MeV, but p is in units of MeV/c, or perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Hmm, maybe better not to think about units right now.

So p ≈29.78 MeV/c. Wait, but that probably doesn't matter for calculating the kinetic energies.

Wait, the energy of the muon is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) since E²=p² + m² when c=1.

So E_mu = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Compute (29.78)^2: approx 887. Because 30^2=900, so 29.78^2 ≈ ~886.6.

So 886.6 + 11172.49 (since m_mu squared is 105.7^2=11172.49) is 12059.09.

So sqrt(12059.09) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

Wait, but the initial energy of the Pi is 139.6 MeV. So the neutrino's energy is p, which is 29.78 MeV. So E_mu is 109.81 MeV.

But the rest mass of the muon is 105.7 MeV, so the kinetic energy (KE) is E_mu - m_mu = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 MeV.

The neutrino's KE is p, which is 29.78 MeV.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: 2.84, 26.8

Option B:7.2,32.8

Option C:3.52,20.8

Option D:4.12,29.8.

Wait, I got mu KE as ~4.11 MeV, and neutrino KE ~29.78 MeV. So that would match option D: 4.12 and 29.8.

Wait, but wait a second. The neutrino's KE is p*c? But I assumed c=1, so p is in MeV/c, and E is in MeV. So the neutrino's energy is p*c, but when c=1, E=pc, so p = E/c. Wait, but in units where c=1, E=pc, so p = E. So in that case, the neutrino's energy is p, which is around 29.78 MeV, which is its KE because its rest mass is zero.

So the muon's KE is about 4.11 MeV, and the neutrino's KE is about 29.78 MeV. So the pair is (4.11, 29.78), which is closest to option D's 4.12 and 29.8.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because sometimes when you set c=1, you can get confused about the terms. Alternatively, perhaps I should do the calculation without assuming c=1, but that's more complicated. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach. The total energy available is the rest energy of the Pi, which is 139.6 MeV. The muon's rest energy is 105.7 MeV, so the maximum possible KE the muon can have is 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV. But in reality, the muon can't take all of this because the neutrino also takes some energy.

Wait, in our calculation, the muon's KE was about 4.11, and the neutrino's about 29.78, which adds up to about 33.89, which is the total energy available beyond the muon's rest mass. Hmm, that makes sense.

Wait, but another way to compute: The sum of the kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino plus their rest mass energies should equal the Pi's rest energy. The neutrino's rest mass is zero, so:

KE_mu + m_mu*c^2 + KE_nu = m_pi*c^2.

Wait, but in our earlier approach, the sum of E_mu and E_nu equals m_pi*c^2.

E_mu = KE_mu + m_mu*c^2.

E_nu = KE_nu (since m_nu is negligible).

So E_mu + E_nu = m_pi*c^2.

Which is (KE_mu + m_mu) + KE_nu = m_pi.

So KE_mu + KE_nu = m_pi - m_mu = 139.6 -105.7 = 33.9 MeV.

So the sum of the KEs should be 33.9 MeV.

Looking at the options, option D's KEs are 4.12 and 29.8, adding up to 33.92, which is about 33.9. That's a good check.

So the correct answer should be D.


The problem involves the decay of a stationary π⁺ meson into a μ⁺ muon and a neutrino, with the goal of finding the kinetic energies of the products. The rest masses of the π⁺ and μ⁺ are given as 139.6 MeV and 105.7 MeV, respectively, and the neutrino's mass is approximated as zero.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Conservation of Energy**: The total energy of the products must equal the rest energy of the π⁺, which is 139.6 MeV. This energy is distributed between the rest energy of the μ⁺ and the kinetic energies of the μ⁺ and the neutrino.

2. **Conservation of Momentum**: Since the π⁺ is stationary, the total momentum of the products must be zero. This implies that the magnitudes of the momenta of the μ⁺ and the neutrino are equal and opposite.

3. **Energy of the μ⁺**: The total energy of the μ⁺ is given by \( E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} \), where \( p \) is the magnitude of the momentum of the μ⁺, and \( m_{\mu} \) is its rest mass. The neutrino's energy is simply \( E_{\nu} = p \), as its rest mass is negligible.

4. **Energy Conservation Equation**: The total energy of the system is:
   \[
   E_{\mu} + E_{\nu} = m_{\pi}
   \]
   Substituting \( E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} \) and \( E_{\nu} = p \), the equation becomes:
   \[
   \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} + p = m_{\pi}
   \]
   Solving for \( p \), we substitute \( m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \):
   \[
   \sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} + p = 139.6
   \]
   Subtracting \( p \) from both sides and squaring:
   \[
   p^2 + 105.7^2 = (139.6 - p)^2
   \]
   Expanding and simplifying:
   \[
   p^2 + 11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2p + p^2
   \]
   \[
   279.2p = 19488.16 - 11172.49
   \]
   \[
   p = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}
   \]

5. **Kinetic Energies**:
   - The kinetic energy of the μ⁺ is:
     \[
     KE_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} - m_{\mu}
     \]
     Substituting \( p = 29.78 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \):
     \[
     KE_{\mu} = \sqrt{29.78^2 + 105.7^2} - 105.7 \approx 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}
     \]
   - The kinetic energy of the neutrino is:
     \[
     KE_{\nu} = p \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}
     \]

6. **Verification**: The total kinetic energy of the products is:
   \[
   KE_{\mu} + KE_{\nu} = 4.11 + 29.78 \approx 33.89 \, \text{MeV}
   \]
   This matches the total energy available after accounting for the μ⁺'s rest mass, confirming the calculations.

### Conclusion:
The kinetic energies of the μ⁺ and the neutrino are approximately 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, respectively. This matches **Option D**.
