Okay, let me try to figure out this chemistry problem. Hmm, so the question is about two reactions and their products when analyzed via HPLC. Alright, let's break it down step by step.

First, Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent, usually reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So the starting material is a ketone at position 3. When LAH reduces it, the ketone (C=O) becomes a CHOH group. So hexan-3-one becomes hexan-3-ol, but wait, the starting molecule is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the structure is CH2CH2-OCH3 attached to the ketone.

Wait, let me draw it. The structure would be: CH2CH2-OCH3 on C5, and the ketone is on C3. So the molecule is:

CH2CH2-OCH3 is on C5, and the ketone is at C3. So when LAH reduces the ketone, the C3 becomes CHOH.

So the product would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, but wait, the starting material is (S) configuration. When you reduce a ketone to an alcohol with LAH, the configuration depends on the starting material. The starting material is (S) configuration. Wait, no, wait, the starting material is a ketone, which is planar, so the configuration at the chiral center (C3) would be determined during the reaction. LAH is a strong reducing agent that typically leads to the formation of secondary alcohols with retention of configuration? Or does it form the alcohol in a specific way.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The starting molecule is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-OCH3 at position 5, and the ketone is at 3. So the molecule is:

CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH2-OCH3.

Wait, no. Wait, hexan-3-one is CH3CH2COCH2CH2CH3. But with a methoxy at position 5. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-OCH3 is on the fifth carbon, so the molecule is:

CH2CH2-OCH3 is the fifth carbon. So the full structure would be: 

CH2-CH2-OCH3 is on the fifth carbon, and the ketone is on the third. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2-OCH3? Wait, no, the numbering is from the ketone. Let me count the carbons.

Wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH3. So in this case, position 3 is the ketone. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2-OCH3?

Wait, no, the starting material is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one, so the six-carbon chain has the ketone at C3 and methoxy at C5.

So the structure is:

CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3? No, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The carbons are 1, 2, 3 (ketone), 4, 5 (methoxy), 6.

So carbon 1: CH3.

Carbon 2: CH2.

Carbon 3: C=O.

Carbon 4: CH2.

Carbon 5: OCH3 attached to CH2.

Carbon 6: CH3? Hmm, no, wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH3. So in 5-methoxyhexan-3-one, the fifth carbon has a methoxy group.

So the structure is: 

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-OCH3.

Wait, no, because the fifth carbon is the one attached to the methoxy. So from the ketone (C3), C4 is CH2, C5 is CH-OCH3, and C6 is CH3.

Wait, perhaps it's:

1: CH3-

2: CH2-

3: C(O)-

4: CH2-

5: CH(OCH3)-

6: CH3.

So the structure is: 

CH3CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

So when you reduce the ketone (C=O) at position 3 with LAH, it becomes CH2OH at position 3. So the product becomes:

CH3CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

Wait, but the starting material was (S) configuration. Oh, wait, the starting material is a ketone, which is not a chiral center, so the (S) designation must be from another chiral center. Wait, but hexan-3-one is a planar group. Hmm. Maybe the (S) designation is for the methoxy group or another part. Wait, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the starting molecule is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the 5-methoxyhexan-3-one has a chiral center at C3? No, wait. Wait, if the ketone is at C3, then C3 has a carbonyl group, which makes it a trigonal planar, not a chiral center. So where is the chiral center? Oh, wait, the methoxy is at C5. So perhaps the molecule is such that C5 is a chiral center.

Wait, if the structure is:

CH3CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

Wait, then the carbon where the methoxy is attached (C5) is connected to four different groups: the adjacent CH2 (C4), the OCH3, and two CH3 groups? No, wait, because C5 is CH(OCH3), so attached groups would be: C4 (CH2-), OCH3, and two CH3's? Wait, wait, no. Let me think.

Let me write the structure again. The molecule is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one.

So the carbons are numbered as follows:

1: CH3-

2: CH2-

3: C=O-

4: CH2-

5: CH(OCH3)-

6: CH3.

So, the structure is:

CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

Wait, so C5 is CH(OCH3), connected to C4 (CH2), C6 (CH3), OCH3, and another substituent? Wait, no, each carbon has four bonds.

Wait, C5 is connected to:

- C4: CH2-

- C6: CH3-

- OCH3 group.

And the fourth bond is a single bond to another CH2 group? No, wait, maybe. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure, but perhaps it's better to move forward.

When LAH reduces the ketone (C3) to an alcohol, the product becomes:

CH3-CH2-C(H)(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

So the product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Now, is this product chiral?

Looking at C3, which now has an OH group. The groups attached to C3 would be:

- C2: CH2-

- C4: CH2-

- OH group.

Plus, the other substituent is perhaps a CH3 from C3's own chain. Wait, wait, no.

Wait, the structure after reduction is:

CH3-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

So C3 has:

- CH2CH2 group (from C2 and the rest), but specifically, the substituents are:

- Two CH2 groups (C2 and C4), one OH group, and one CH(CH2-OCH3-CH3) ?

Wait, no, perhaps C3 has:

- CH2- (from C2)

- CH2- (from C4)

- OH

- And a CH2CH(OCH3)CH3 group.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to note that C3 is connected to:

- C2: CH2-

- C4: CH2-

- OH

- And a CH2 group leading to C5 and C6.

Wait, actually, perhaps the structure is:

CH3-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

In this structure, C3 has:

- CH2CH3 (from C2: CH3-CH2-)

- CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3 (from C4)

- OH

- And another CH2 group? Wait, no, each carbon has four bonds. So C3 has:

- CH3-CH2- (from left)

- CH2- (from right, leading to C4, which is connected to another CH2 and then to C5 and C6)

- OH group.

Ah, perhaps C3 is connected to:

- Left: CH2CH2 (from C2 and C1?)

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the structure again. So the product after Reaction I is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Now, is this molecule chiral?

At C3, the groups attached would be:

- Two CH2 groups (from C2 and C4)

- An OH group

- And the rest would be the chain leading to C5 and C6, which includes a CH(OCH3)CH3 group.

Wait, wait, perhaps C3 is connected to:

- C2: CH2-

- C4: CH2-

- OH group

- And a CH2 group attached to the rest of the molecule (C5 and C6).

Wait, no, perhaps the substituents are:

C3 is connected to:

1. CH2-CH2-..., which is from C2 (CH3-CH2-).

2. CH2-..., which is from C4 (CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3).

3. OH group.

4. And another substituent, perhaps a methyl group? No, because the chain continues beyond C4.

Wait, maybe C3 is connected to:

- CH3-CH2- (left side)

- CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3 (right side)

- OH

- And a hydrogen?

Wait, no, LAH is a strong reducing agent that would add two hydrogens. So the ketone (C=O) becomes CH2OH. Wait, no, no. Wait, when you reduce a ketone (R2CO) with LAH, it becomes R2CH(OH)Li, which upon workup becomes R2CH2OH. Wait, no, wait, LAH is LiAlH4; when it reduces a ketone, it becomes a secondary alcohol. So the ketone R2CO becomes R2CH(OH) after workup.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the steps. So for hexan-3-one, after reduction, it becomes hexan-3-ol. So in this case, the product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, where the OH is on C3 and a methoxy on C5.

Now, is C3 a chiral center? For that, C3 must have four different substituents.

Let me list the groups on C3:

- The groups are:

1. The left side: CH2CH3 (from C1 and C2).

Wait, no, if the structure is CH3-CH2-C(OH)H-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3, then C3 has:

1. CH2CH3 (from C2)

2. CH2- (from C4, which is connected to CH(OCH3)-CH3)

3. OH

4. and a hydrogen (since the ketone is reduced to CH(OH)H, but wait, maybe not. Wait, LAH adds two H's. So the ketone O=C-R becomes R-CH2-OH after workup? No, wait, no. Wait, LAH reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So the structure would be R2CO → R2CH(OH). So in this case, the two substituents on either side of C3 are CH2 groups (from C2 and C4). So C3 would have:

- CH2CH3 on one side (from C2)

- CH2CH2CH3 on the other (from C4, which is CH2 connected to CH(OCH3) and CH3)

Wait, no. Let me think again.

The product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. The structure is:

CH3-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

So C3 is the OH-bearing carbon. Its substituents are:

- C2: CH2CH3 (since C2 is CH2 connected to C1 (CH3) and C3).

- C4: CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3 (since C4 is connected to C5, which has the methoxy).

- OH group.

- And a hydrogen, because the carbon is CH(OH)H.

Wait, no. If the starting ketone is R-CO-R', then the reduction would give R-CH(OH)-R'.

So, in this case, it's (CH2CH2)CO(CH2CH2OCH3) → (CH2CH2)CH(OH)(CH2CH2OCH3).

So C3 is connected to:

- CH2CH3 (from the left side, C2 and C1)

- CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3 (from the right side, C4, C5, C6)

- OH group

- and a hydrogen.

Wait, but that would make four different groups: CH2CH3, CH2-..., OH, and H. So yes, C3 is a chiral center. And the starting material was (S) configuration, which would be retained because LAH is a strong reducing agent that typically leads to retention of configuration in the sense that the hydrogen adds from the same face, but wait, for ketones, when reduced, the configuration at the new chiral center is R or S depending on the starting material.

Wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, which has a chiral center at C5? Or at C3?

Wait, no, the starting material is a ketone, so C3 is not a chiral center. The only chiral center would be at C5, which has a methoxy group.

Wait, no. Let me think again. 5-methoxyhexan-3-one structure:

Positions are:

1: CH3-

2: CH2-

3: C=O-

4: CH2-

5: CH(OCH3)-

6: CH3.

So, the groups attached to C5 are:

- C4: CH2-

- C6: CH3-

- OCH3 group

- And another CH2 group? No, because C5 is attached to C4, C6, OCH3, and another substituent. Wait, no, each carbon has four bonds.

Wait, the structure is:

CH3CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

So, C5 is CH(OCH3), attached to:

- C4 (CH2-)

- C6 (CH3-)

- OCH3

- And another group? Wait, no, because the CH(OCH3) is connected to C4 and C6, and has the OCH3. So, perhaps the groups are:

- C4: CH2-

- C6: CH3-

- OCH3-

- And a hydrogen? No, because CH(OCH3) suggests a CH2 group with OCH3 attached.

Wait, no, I'm getting stuck again. Let me approach it differently. The starting molecule is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, which means that the configuration at C5 is S.

So, when LAH reduces the ketone (C3) to an alcohol, the product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Now, in this product, is C3 a chiral center?

Yes, because it's attached to four different groups:

- Two CH2 groups (left and right), an OH group, and a hydrogen.

Wait, no, wait. Let's think about the exact structure. The molecule after reduction is:

CH3-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

So, C3 has:

- Left: CH2CH3

- Right: CH2CH(OCH3)CH3

- OH group

- and a hydrogen.

Wait, no, the right side is CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3. So the groups are:

1. CH2CH3 (from C2)

2. CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3 (from C4)

3. OH

4. H.

So four different groups: yes, C3 is a chiral center. Now, what's the configuration? The starting material was (S) at C5, but the new chiral center is C3. So the configuration at C3 would be determined by the reduction.

Wait, when you reduce a ketone to an alcohol, the configuration of the new chiral center is determined by the mechanism. LAH is a strong reducing agent that typically adds hydride from the less substituted side, but I'm not sure about the stereochemistry here.

Alternatively, maybe because the starting ketone is symmetrical in some way, the reduction would lead to a racemic mixture. Wait, no, I think LAH can induce certain configurations.

Wait, no. In the case of a planar sp2 hybridized carbon (the ketone), the addition of hydride would occur from either face, leading to a racemic mixture. But wait, in this case, the starting material is a single enantiomer. Hmm, wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. But the ketone at C3 is not a chiral center. So maybe the starting material has a chiral center elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has a chiral center at C5. So the configuration is S at C5, which would affect the structure of the product.

But when the ketone is reduced, it creates a new chiral center at C3. Since the starting material is a single enantiomer, and the reduction is stereospecific, perhaps the product will have a specific configuration at C3.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should consider that the product will have a new chiral center at C3, but whether it's R or S depends on the starting material's configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the reduction leads to a 50:50 mix of R and S at C3, but given that the starting material is a specific enantiomer, maybe not. Hmm, not sure. Let me move on for now and come back.

Now, moving to Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione treated with excess NaBH4 followed by acidic workup.

Pentane-2,4-dione is (CH3CO)2CH2, I think. Wait, no. Wait, pentane-2,4-dione is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2- something. Let me see. Pentane has five carbons. So positions 2 and 4 are ketones.

Structure: O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, pentane-2,4-dione is (CH3CO)CH2COCH3? No, wait, the formula would be O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, I think it's O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3? No, no, wait, pentane-2,4-dione is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-.

Wait, no, wait, let me think. The formula for pentane-2,4-dione is CH3-CO-CH2-CO-CH3. So it's two ketone groups on the second and fourth carbons of a five-carbon chain. So the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3? No, wait, wait, no. Let me count the carbons.

Pentane-2,4-dione: positions 2 and 4 are carbonyl groups. So the structure is:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.

So it's (CH3)2CO-(CH2)CO-(CH3)2? No, wait, the structure is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3? No, no, wait, perhaps it's better to write it as:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3? No, no, that would be 2 and 4 positions in a five-carbon chain. So the correct structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3. Wait, that would give five carbons: positions 1 (O=C), 2 (CH2), 3 (CH2), 4 (CO), 5 (CH3)? No, no, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, pentane-2,4-dione: the carbonyl groups are on carbons 2 and 4. So the structure is:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.

So that's a five-carbon chain (since the two ketones are on carbons 2 and 4, with a CH2 in between).

When NaBH4 is used to reduce it. NaBH4 is a mild reducing agent that typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. But wait, in this case, we have two ketone groups.

So, each ketone group (at C2 and C4) will be reduced by NaBH4. But wait, the question says excess NaBH4. So both ketones would be fully reduced.

So the product would be a diol: CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

Wait, let me write the structure: 

After reduction, each ketone becomes an alcohol.

So starting with:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.

After reduction, it becomes:

CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

So the product is pentane-2,4-diol.

Now, is this molecule chiral?

Looking at the molecule, the two alcohol groups are on C2 and C4.

Each of these carbons is attached to:

- For C2: CH3, OH, CH2-CH(OH)-CH3, and another CH2 group.

Wait, let me think about the substituents on C2 and C4.

For C2:

- CH3 (from C1)

- OH

- CH2- (connected to C3 and C4)

- and another CH2 group (from C1 and C2).

Wait, no, perhaps more accurately, the groups attached to C2 are:

- CH3 (from C1)

- OH

- CH2-CH(OH)-CH3 (from C3 and beyond)

- And a hydrogen? No, because each carbon has four bonds.

Wait, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

So C2: attached to:

- C1: CH3

- C3: CH2

- OH

- and a hydrogen? No, wait, because the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

Wait, no, each of the CH(OH) groups is attached to two CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that C2 and C4 each have four different groups. Let's check C2:

- CH3 (from C1)

- OH

- CH2-CH(OH)-CH3 (from C3 and C4)

- and a hydrogen? No, because it's a CH2 group.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The structure is:

C1: CH3-

C2: CH(OH)-

C3: CH2-

C4: CH(OH)-

C5: CH3.

So, C2 is connected to:

- C1: CH3

- C3: CH2

- OH

- and another substituent. Wait, but CH(OH) would be connected to C1 and C3, with the OH group. So the groups on C2 are:

- CH3

- CH2-

- OH

- And a single bond to another CH2? No, that doesn't add up.

Wait, perhaps the substituents on C2 are:

- Two CH2 groups (left and right)

- OH

- And another group, which is a methyl (CH3) from C1.

Wait, that would make three different groups, plus a hydrogen, making it four substituents but not all different. So C2 would not be a chiral center.

Wait, but let's think again. The groups on C2 are:

- CH3 (from C1)

- CH2-CH(OH)-CH3 (from C3 and C4)

- OH

- and a hydrogen, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the groups are:

- CH3

- CH2- (leading to C3 and C4)

- OH

- and another CH2.

No, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me check if the molecule is meso or not.

The product after Reaction II is pentane-2,4-diol. So the structure is:

HOCH2(CH2)2CH2OH ?

Wait, no, the correct structure is CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

Now, looking at the molecule, the two OH groups are on C2 and C4. Are these two carbons chiral centers?

For C2: groups are CH3, OH, CH2-CH(OH)-CH3, and a hydrogen? Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me think of each carbon's substituents.

At C2: attached groups are:

- C1: CH3

- C3: CH2

- OH

- and a hydrogen? No, because the carbon is CH(OH), so it's CH2 group. Wait, no, I'm getting stuck again.

Wait, perhaps each of the secondary alcohols (C2 and C4) are connected to two CH2 groups, an OH, and a CH3 group.

Wait, for C2:

- CH3 (C1)

- CH2 (C3)

- OH

- and a CH2 group (from C1 and itself)? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps C2 has:

- CH3

- CH2-CH(OH)-CH3

- OH

- and a hydrogen.

Wait, that would make four different groups, making C2 a chiral center. Similarly, C4 would have the same groups. But wait, if the molecule is symmetrical, then C2 and C4 would be mirror images.

Wait, the molecule is symmetrical along the center (C3). So if C2 and C4 are each chiral centers, but their configurations are opposite, then the molecule would be meso, making it achiral overall.

Wait, let's consider the structure:

The molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. So it's symmetrical with a plane of symmetry through the central carbon (C3). So the left and right sides are mirror images.

If C2 and C4 are chiral centers with opposite configurations, the molecule would be meso, meaning it has an internal plane of symmetry and is not chiral.

So, pentane-2,4-diol would be a meso compound. Therefore, it has two chiral centers (C2 and C4) but is achiral overall because it's a meso compound.

So, the product from Reaction II is pentane-2,4-diol, which is a meso compound and thus not chiral. So it would appear as a single peak in a chiral HPLC column, but wait, no. Wait, no, in a chiral HPLC column, a meso compound would have no chiral centers, but wait, no, the meso compound has chiral centers but they are in a symmetrical arrangement. So when running on a chiral HPLC column, which is a type of column that separates enantiomers, a meso compound would not have any enantiomers, so it would elute as a single peak. But what about normal-phase HPLC?

Wait, but normal-phase HPLC is based on the interaction between the polar stationary phase and the polar mobile phase. The separation is based on the polarity of the compounds. So in normal-phase HPLC, if two compounds are enantiomers but have the same physical properties (like melting point, boiling point, solubility), they would elute at the same time because their polarity is the same.

Wait, but in this case, the product from Reaction II is a single compound: the meso form of pentane-2,4-diol. So in normal-phase HPLC, it would be a single peak. In chiral HPLC, since it's a meso compound, it would also be a single peak. Wait, no, because a chiral HPLC column is designed to separate enantiomers. If the compound is achiral (meso), it would pass through the column without any interaction, leading to a single peak.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the concepts. Let me recap.

Chiral HPLC columns are used to separate enantiomers. If the compound is not chiral (i.e., it's a meso compound), it would not have enantiomers and would elute as a single peak. So in this case, pentane-2,4-diol is a meso compound and would show as one peak in both normal-phase and chiral HPLC.

Wait, but earlier I thought it would have two chiral centers but be meso. So the product is a single compound, non-chiral, and would show as one peak in both columns.

Now, moving back to Reaction I. The product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Earlier, I was trying to determine if it's chiral. Let's get back to that.

The product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. The structure is CH3-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

Looking at C3: the groups attached are:

- CH2CH3 (from C2)

- CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3 (from C4)

- OH

- H.

So four different groups: yes, C3 is a chiral center.

Now, what's the configuration? The starting material was (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. Wait, but in the starting material, the ketone is at C3, which is not a chiral center. The (S) designation must be at C5, which is where the methoxy is attached.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one, and the (S) configuration is at C5. So when the ketone is reduced, a new chiral center is formed at C3, and the configuration at C5 remains.

So the product from Reaction I is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, with a chiral center at C3 and another at C5.

Wait, but in the starting material, C5 is a chiral center with (S) configuration. After reduction, C5 remains the same, and a new chiral center is formed at C3.

So the product has two chiral centers: C3 and C5.

Now, the question is whether these are both R or S, or if they form a meso compound, or something else.

But wait, the starting material is (S)-configured at C5, and the reduction at C3 would create a new chiral center. So the product would have two chiral centers: C3 and C5.

So the product from Reaction I is a diastereomer, perhaps a single enantiomer, but more likely, since the starting material was a single enantiomer, the product would have two chiral centers and be a single diastereomer.

But wait, when you reduce a ketone, the new chiral center's configuration depends on the approach of the hydride. LAH typically adds the hydride from the less substituted side, but in this case, the ketone is in the middle, so perhaps the configuration is determined by the starting material.

Wait, perhaps the configuration at C3 would be determined by the starting material's configuration at C5. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the product would have a specific configuration at C3 based on the reaction's stereochemistry.

But perhaps for the purpose of this problem, the exact configuration doesn't matter as much as the number of chiral centers and whether the products are chiral or not.

Now, the two reactions are done, and their products are combined. So the products are:

From Reaction I: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (with two chiral centers at C3 and C5).

From Reaction II: pentane-2,4-diol (meso compound, no net chirality).

So when combined, the mixture contains:

- 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (two chiral centers, potentially two stereoisomers if it's a meso compound, but earlier I thought it's not meso because the two chiral centers are not symmetrical).

Wait, let me think about 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. The structure is:

CH3-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

Now, are there any planes of symmetry in this molecule? Let's see.

The molecule is symmetrical if you look from C3 to C5. Wait, no, because the substituents on C3 and C5 are different. C3 has OH and H, while C5 has OCH3 and CH3.

So, it's not symmetrical. Therefore, the molecule is chiral with two chiral centers. The possible stereoisomers are four (2^2 = 4), but if the molecule is meso, some would be identical.

Wait, but in this case, the two chiral centers are not symmetrical. So the molecule can exist as four stereoisomers. However, the product from Reaction I is a single enantiomer, because the starting material was a single enantiomer and the reduction led to a specific configuration.

Wait, the starting material was (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, which has a chiral center at C5 (S configuration). After reduction, a new chiral center is formed at C3.

So the product will have a specific configuration at both C3 and C5, making it a single stereoisomer. Therefore, when isolated, it's a single compound with two chiral centers, so it's a diastereomer, but it's a single compound, not a mixture.

Wait, but wait: when you reduce a ketone to an alcohol, the configuration at the new chiral center is determined by the reaction. If the starting material is a racemic mixture, the product would be racemic, but if the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product would have a specific configuration at C3.

But since the starting material is (S)-configured at C5, and the reduction is stereospecific, perhaps the product is a single stereoisomer with specific configurations at C3 and C5.

So in this case, the product from Reaction I is a single stereoisomer with two chiral centers. So when combined with the product from Reaction II, which is a single non-chiral compound, the combined products would be:

- 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (single compound, two chiral centers → possibly four stereoisomers, but the product is a single stereoisomer).

Wait, no, the product from Reaction I is a single stereoisomer. So when you combine it with the meso compound from Reaction II, you have two compounds: the single stereoisomer and the meso diol.

Now, the question is about how many peaks each would show on the HPLC columns.

First, normal-phase HPLC: this separates based on polarity. The two products are:

1. 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol: this is a secondary alcohol with an electron-donating methoxy group, making it somewhat polar.

2. Pentane-2,4-diol (meso): this is a diol, which is more polar than the first compound.

In normal-phase HPLC, the less polar compounds elute earlier (they spend less time on the polar stationary phase). So, the more polar the compound, the later it elutes.

So, 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol is less polar than pentane-2,4-diol because it's a mono-alcohol with a methoxy group, whereas the diol is more polar due to two OH groups.

So, in normal-phase HPLC, the two compounds would separate into two peaks: one for each compound. So two peaks.

Wait, but wait: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol is a single stereoisomer, so it's a single compound. The diol is also a single compound (meso). So in normal-phase HPLC, they would each have one peak, so two peaks in total.

Now, the chiral HPLC column: this is used to separate enantiomers. So, for each chiral compound in the mixture, if it has enantiomers, they will separate into multiple peaks.

So, let's see:

- 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol has two chiral centers. Since it's a single stereoisomer (from a single enantiomeric starting material), it's a single compound. So in chiral HPLC, it would elute as a single peak.

Wait, no. Wait, chiral HPLC is designed to separate enantiomers. If the compound itself is a single enantiomer, it would pass through the column without separation. So it would elute as one peak.

But wait, if the compound has more than one chiral center and is not a meso compound, would it still be a single peak in chiral HPLC? Because chiral columns can separate enantiomers but not diastereomers. So if the compound has two chiral centers and is a diastereomer, it would not be separated by a chiral column. Wait, no, wait: a chiral column is designed to separate enantiomers, which are non-superimposable mirror images. Diastereomers (which are not mirror images) would not be separated on a chiral column unless the column's stationary phase interacts differently with them, which is not the case.

Wait, but diastereomers have different physical properties and would separate on normal-phase HPLC, but not on chiral HPLC because the column doesn't distinguish between diastereomers in terms of chirality.

Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me clarify:

- Enantiomers: mirror images, same physical properties except for optical activity. Chiral columns separate them.

- Diastereomers: different physical properties, may be separated on normal-phase HPLC.

So, for 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which is a single stereoisomer (not an enantiomer of itself), it would elute as a single peak on chiral HPLC because it's not an enantiomer but a single compound.

Wait, no, perhaps I should think differently. The chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase. If the compound has its own chiral centers, it may interact with the column, but if it's a single enantiomer, it would pass through as a single peak.

But wait, the product from Reaction I is a single stereoisomer with two chiral centers, so it's not an enantiomer of itself. Therefore, in a chiral column, it would not have a mirror image to separate from, so it would elute as a single peak.

But wait, if the compound has two chiral centers and is a single stereoisomer, it's not an enantiomer of another. So in a chiral column, it would appear as one peak.

Now, the other product is pentane-2,4-diol, which is a meso compound. It's achiral because it has an internal plane of symmetry. So in a chiral column, it would pass through without separation, appearing as a single peak.

Wait, but wait: if a compound is meso, it's achiral, so it doesn't have enantiomers. So in a chiral column, which is designed to separate enantiomers, the meso compound would not have any enantiomers to separate, so it would elute as a single peak.

So putting it all together:

In normal-phase HPLC, we have two compounds: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (one peak) and pentane-2,4-diol (another peak). So two peaks.

In chiral HPLC, we have two compounds:

- 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol: a single peak.

- Pentane-2,4-diol: a single peak.

So total of two peaks.

Wait, but wait, the product from Reaction I is a single stereoisomer with two chiral centers, but is it a meso compound? No, because the two chiral centers are not symmetrical. So the compound is chiral, but it's a single stereoisomer. So in a chiral HPLC column, would it appear as one peak or multiple?

Wait, no. Chiral HPLC columns are used to separate enantiomers. If the compound is a single stereoisomer, it will appear as one peak. So in this case, only one peak for the 5-methoxy compound, and one peak for the meso diol.

Wait, but wait, the diol is a meso compound, so it's not chiral. So in a chiral column, it would appear as a single peak because it's not an enantiomer of anything else.

So in the chiral column, two peaks: one for each compound.

Wait, but earlier I thought the diol would appear as a single peak in both columns, and the other compound would also appear as a single peak. So in both columns, two peaks.

But the options don't have that. The options are A to D.

Wait, let me review the options again:

Options:

A) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC

B) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC

C) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC

D) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC

Wait, but according to my analysis, both columns would show two peaks each. But none of the options match that. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a single stereoisomer, but it's a diastereomer, not an enantiomer. So in a chiral column, it would not separate, but in normal-phase, it would.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the concepts. Let me think again.

The product from Reaction I is a diastereomer with two chiral centers. So, in normal-phase HPLC, which is based on polarity, it would have a different retention time than the diol, leading to two peaks.

In chiral HPLC, since the product has two chiral centers and is a single stereoisomer, it would not have any enantiomers in the mixture. So it would elute as a single peak. Similarly, the diol is a meso compound and would also elute as a single peak.

So chiral HPLC: 2 peaks.

Normal-phase HPLC: 2 peaks.

But none of the options have two peaks in both cases. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a pair of enantiomers. No, because the starting material was a single enantiomer, and the reduction led to a specific configuration. So the product is a single stereoisomer.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the product from Reaction I has more than one chiral center leading to multiple stereoisomers, but the starting material's configuration leads to a single diastereomer.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the number of stereoisomers possible for 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

The structure is:

CH3-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

It has two chiral centers: C3 and C5.

Each can be R or S, leading to 2^2 = 4 possible stereoisomers.

But the starting material was (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, which after reduction leads to a specific configuration at C3 and retains the S configuration at C5.

So the product is a single stereoisomer, not a mixture.

So in the mixture, we have this single stereoisomer and the meso diol.

So, in normal-phase HPLC, two peaks.

In chiral HPLC, the product from Reaction I is a single stereoisomer, so one peak. The diol is a meso compound, so one peak. So two peaks in total.

But according to the options, there's no option where both columns have two peaks.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in determining the number of chiral centers in the product from Reaction I.

Wait, let me think again. The product from Reaction I is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. The structure is:

CH3-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

At C3: groups are CH2CH3, CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3, OH, H.

At C5: groups are CH2-CH(OH)-CH3, CH3, OCH3, and another group.

Wait, perhaps C5 is not a chiral center. Let me check.

Wait, the starting material was (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, which has a chiral center at C5.

After reduction, the structure becomes:

CH3-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

So, C5 is attached to:

- C4: CH2-

- C6: CH3-

- OCH3

- and another CH2 group (from C5 to C4 and C6).

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me write it as:

Positions:

1: CH3

2: CH2

3: CH(OH)

4: CH2

5: CH(OCH3)

6: CH3.

So, C5 is attached to:

- C4: CH2-

- C6: CH3-

- OCH3

- and another substituent, which is CH2 from C5 to C6.

Wait, perhaps the groups on C5 are:

- CH2 (from C4)

- CH3 (from C6)

- OCH3

- and another CH2 group (from C5 to C4 and C6).

Wait, that can't be right. Each carbon must have four bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps C5 is connected to:

- C4: CH2-

- C6: CH3-

- OCH3

- and another CH2 group (from C5 to C4 and C6).

Wait, that seems off. Let me think of it as:

C5: CH(OCH3), attached to C4 (CH2-) and C6 (CH3-).

So the groups on C5 would be:

- C4: CH2-

- C6: CH3-

- OCH3

- and another substituent, which is a CH2 group.

Wait, but that would make four different groups: CH2- (C4), CH3- (C6), OCH3, and another CH2.

Wait, no, perhaps it's:

C5 is connected to:

- C4: CH2-

- C6: CH3-

- OCH3

- and a hydrogen.

Wait, no, because the starting material is a ketone, and after reduction, the structure changes.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I has only one chiral center: C3.

Wait, because C5 might not be a chiral center anymore. Let me think.

In the product, is C5 a chiral center?

The structure is:

CH3-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

At C5, the groups are:

- C4: CH2-

- C6: CH3-

- OCH3-

- and a single bond to another CH2 group.

Wait, that would make four substituents, but perhaps two are the same.

Wait, if C5 is connected to two CH2 groups, then it's not a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that C5 has two CH2 groups attached, making it not a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, but assuming that the product from Reaction I has one chiral center (C3), then it would be a single stereoisomer.

So, in this case, the product from Reaction I is a single chiral compound (one chiral center), and the product from Reaction II is a meso compound (non-chiral).

So, in normal-phase HPLC, two peaks: one for each compound.

In chiral HPLC, the product from Reaction I (a single chiral compound) would elute as one peak, and the diol (meso) would elute as another peak. So two peaks in total.

But according to the options, that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I has two chiral centers, and the product from Reaction II is a meso compound with two chiral centers but no net chirality.

So, in the combined mixture, we have:

- 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol: two chiral centers, single stereoisomer.

- Pentane-2,4-diol: meso, single compound.

Now, in normal-phase HPLC, two peaks.

In chiral HPLC, the 5-methoxy compound is a single stereoisomer, so one peak. The diol is a meso compound, so one peak. Total of two peaks.

But none of the options match that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a pair of enantiomers. No, because the starting material was a single enantiomer, and the reduction would produce a single stereoisomer.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a racemic mixture, but that's not the case here because the starting material was a single enantiomer.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the possibility of the product from Reaction I being a meso compound. No, because the substituents are not symmetrical.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a single chiral compound with two chiral centers, and the diol is a meso compound.

So, in chiral HPLC, the product from Reaction I would appear as a single peak (since it's a single stereoisomer), and the diol as another single peak. So two peaks.

In normal-phase HPLC, two peaks.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a single compound with two chiral centers, and the diol is a meso compound.

So, in normal-phase HPLC, two peaks.

In chiral HPLC, the product from Reaction I would have two chiral centers, but the chiral column would not separate diastereomers, only enantiomers. So the product from Reaction I would appear as one peak, and the diol as another peak. So two peaks.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a meso compound, but that's not the case. Because the substituents on C3 and C5 are different, so symmetry is unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I has four stereoisomers, but as the starting material was a single enantiomer, only one is present.

So, in the mixture, we have:

- Reaction I product: 1 stereoisomer.

- Reaction II product: 1 stereoisomer (meso).

So, in normal-phase HPLC: two peaks.

In chiral HPLC: two peaks.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is that in both columns, two peaks are observed. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction II is not a meso compound. Let me think again.

Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione treated with excess NaBH4.

The product is pentane-2,4-diol: HO-CH2-CO-CH2-CO-OH? No, no, it's HO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-OH? No, no. Wait, the correct structure is CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

This is a meso compound because the two OH groups are on symmetric positions (C2 and C4), and the molecule has an internal plane of symmetry.

So, the diol is a meso compound, so it's achiral and would appear as a single peak in both columns.

The product from Reaction I is a single stereoisomer with two chiral centers. So in normal-phase HPLC, it's one peak, the diol is another. So two peaks.

In chiral HPLC, the product from Reaction I (a single stereoisomer) is one peak, the diol is another. So two peaks.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the number of peaks.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the product from Reaction I is not a single stereoisomer but a racemic mixture.

No, because the starting material was a single enantiomer, and the reduction would produce a single stereoisomer.

Hmm. Maybe I should look at the options again.

The options are:

A) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC

B) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC

C) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC

D) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a diastereomer with two chiral centers, leading to four possible stereoisomers, but the reaction produces a single stereoisomer. So in normal-phase HPLC, it's one peak, and the diol is another: two peaks.

In chiral HPLC, the product from Reaction I is a single stereoisomer, so one peak, and the diol is another: two peaks.

But again, this doesn't match any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a meso compound, but that's not possible because the substituents are not symmetrical.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of chiral centers. Let me think again.

If the product from Reaction I has only one chiral center, then in normal-phase HPLC, two peaks, and in chiral HPLC, two peaks (the diol as one, the reaction I product as another).

But the options don't have that either.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing that the product from Reaction I is a pair of enantiomers, leading to two peaks in chiral HPLC.

But that would require the product to be a racemic mixture, which isn't the case here.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a diastereomer with two chiral centers, leading to four stereoisomers, but the reaction produces two stereoisomers, which are enantiomers of each other. But I don't think that's the case.

Wait, maybe I should think about the number of peaks based on the possibility of epimers or other factors.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a single stereoisomer, and the diol is another, leading to two peaks in both columns.

But since none of the options match, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a single stereoisomer with two chiral centers, and the diol is a meso compound. So in chiral HPLC, the product from Reaction I would be one peak, the diol would be another, totaling two peaks. In normal-phase, same: two peaks.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is B) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.

Wait, but why would chiral HPLC have three peaks?

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in the product from Reaction II. Wait, Reaction II is pentane-2,4-dione treated with excess NaBH4.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diol with four chiral centers, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction II is a diol with two chiral centers, and since NaBH4 is in excess, maybe it's a mixture of stereoisomers.

Wait, no, NaBH4 reduces ketones to secondary alcohols, but in this case, the starting material is a symmetrical diketone. So the product would have two chiral centers, but considering the symmetry, it's a meso compound.

So, the diol is a single compound (meso), so in HPLC, one peak.

Hmm.

Perhaps I'm missing that the product from Reaction I is a pair of enantiomers, leading to two peaks in chiral HPLC. But why would that happen?

No, because the starting material was a single enantiomer, the product would be a single stereoisomer.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the product from Reaction I is a diastereomer with four stereoisomers, but only one is formed, leading to one peak in normal-phase HPLC and one peak in chiral HPLC.

But I'm not making progress here.

Perhaps I should consider that the product from Reaction I has two chiral centers, and thus four possible stereoisomers, but the reaction produces a single stereoisomer, so in normal-phase HPLC, two peaks (the product and the diol), and in chiral HPLC, two peaks (the product and the diol).

But again, no matching option.

Wait, another approach: think about how many different compounds are present.

From Reaction I: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (one compound).

From Reaction II: pentane-2,4-diol (one compound).

So, two different compounds in total.

In normal-phase HPLC, these two would have different retention times, leading to two peaks.

In chiral HPLC, these two would also have different retention times, leading to two peaks.

So, the total peaks would be two in both cases.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is B) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.

Wait, but why three peaks in chiral HPLC?

Ah, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a single compound with two chiral centers, which could have multiple stereoisomers, but the reaction produces only one. So in chiral HPLC, it would appear as one peak, and the diol as another. So two peaks.

But this doesn't match any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I has four stereoisomers, but the reaction produces two, leading to two peaks in normal-phase HPLC and two in chiral HPLC.

But again, the options don't match.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Let me think about the possible products and their HPLC behavior.

Reaction I product: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Assuming it's a single stereoisomer with two chiral centers.

Reaction II product: pentane-2,4-diol (meso).

So, in the mixture, two compounds.

In normal-phase HPLC: two peaks.

In chiral HPLC: two peaks.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I has two chiral centers, leading to four stereoisomers, but the reaction produces two of them, leading to two peaks in normal-phase HPLC.

Wait, but the starting material was a single enantiomer, so the product would be a single stereoisomer.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a racemic mixture, leading to two peaks in chiral HPLC.

But that's not the case here because the starting material was a single enantiomer.

I'm not making progress. Perhaps I should look for a pattern in the options.

The options suggest varying numbers of peaks.

The correct answer is likely B) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.

Wait, but why?

Perhaps the product from Reaction I has two chiral centers, leading to four stereoisomers, but the reaction produces two, leading to two peaks in normal-phase HPLC and two in chiral HPLC.

But that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a single compound, and the diol is another, but the chiral HPLC also separates any possible diastereomers, leading to more peaks.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a single compound, and the diol is another, leading to two peaks in both columns. But this isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of chiral centers in the product from Reaction I.

If the product has only one chiral center, then in normal-phase HPLC, two peaks (product and diol).

In chiral HPLC, the product would be one peak, diol another: two peaks.

But the options don't have that.

Hmm.

I'm going to have to make an educated guess.

Based on the analysis, the products are:

- Reaction I: single stereoisomer with two chiral centers.

- Reaction II: meso compound (single compound).

In normal-phase HPLC: two compounds → two peaks.

In chiral HPLC: two compounds → two peaks.

But since none of the options match, perhaps the correct answer is B) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a diastereomer with two chiral centers, leading to two peaks in normal-phase HPLC and two peaks in chiral HPLC.

But again, I'm not sure.

Another thought: perhaps the product from Reaction I is a meso compound, but I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I has two chiral centers and is a meso compound, leading to a single peak in both columns.

But that's not possible because the substituents aren't symmetrical.

I'm stuck. I'll have to go with the initial analysis: two peaks in both columns, but since that's not an option, perhaps B is the intended answer, assuming that the product from Reaction I has three peaks and the diol has another.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves analyzing the products of two reactions and determining the number of peaks observed in normal-phase HPLC and chiral HPLC chromatograms.

### Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH
- **Reaction details**: LAH reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol, forming 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. The starting material has a chiral center at C5, and the reduction introduces a new chiral center at C3.
- **Product structure**: The product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which has two chiral centers (C3 and C5). Since the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product is a single stereoisomer with specific configurations at both chiral centers.
- **Chirality**: The product is chiral and not a meso compound because the substituents at C3 and C5 are not symmetrical.

### Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione treated with excess NaBH4
- **Reaction details**: NaBH4 reduces both ketone groups at C2 and C4 to secondary alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol.
- **Product structure**: The product is a meso compound because the molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, making it achiral despite having two chiral centers (C2 and C4).

### Combined Products
- **From Reaction I**: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (single stereoisomer with two chiral centers).
- **From Reaction II**: Pentane-2,4-diol (meso compound, single compound).

### Analysis of HPLC Results
1. **Normal-Phase HPLC**:
   - Separates based on polarity.
   - The two products (5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and pentane-2,4-diol) are distinct compounds with different polarities.
   - **Expected peaks**: 2 peaks.

2. **Chiral HPLC**:
   - Separates enantiomers but not diastereomers.
   - 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol is a single stereoisomer and will elute as one peak.
   - Pentane-2,4-diol is a meso compound and will elute as one peak.
   - **Expected peaks**: 2 peaks.

### Evaluation of Options
- **Option A**: 5 peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC → Incorrect, as only two compounds are present.
- **Option B**: 3 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC → Incorrect, as only two peaks are expected in both columns.
- **Option C**: 4 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC → Incorrect, as only two peaks are expected in both columns.
- **Option D**: 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC → Incorrect, as only two peaks are expected in both columns.

### Conclusion
The analysis indicates that both columns should show two peaks. However, none of the options match this conclusion. Based on the reasoning provided, the closest match is **Option B**, which assumes three peaks in chiral HPLC, possibly due to an error in the problem setup or interpretation.

ANSWER: B
