Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of NMR spectroscopy and reaction mechanisms. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about identifying the number of 13C-NMR signals in compound E, which is the product of a series of reactions starting from propionaldehyde. The options are A)8, B)6, C)11, D)3. I need to figure out each step of the reaction pathway and then determine the structure of E to analyze its carbon environment.

First, let's break down each reaction step.

1. **Propionaldehyde + EDT/BF3 → A**
   Propionaldehyde is CH3CH2CHO. I remember that BF3 is a Lewis acid catalyst. EDT might be something else, but wait, I think EDT is ethyl diisopropyl tin. Oh wait, another possibility: EDT is ethyl diazomethane? Or maybe it's a typo, perhaps it's something else. Hmm, wait, maybe I'm confusing the abbreviations. Alternatively, I recall that BF3 is used in certain aldehyde reactions, maybe the formation of enolates.

   Alternatively, another thought: when an aldehyde reacts with a base like BF3·THF (which is a Lewis acid), it can form an enol. Oh wait, maybe it's a conjugate addition or something else. Wait, another possibility: the reaction is the formation of an enolate. Propionaldehyde is an aldehyde, and when treated with a strong base, like maybe BuLi, but wait the first reagent is EDT and BF3. Hmm, perhaps it's a variation of the Bayer-Villiger oxidation, but I don't think that's it because I think that requires a ketone, not an aldehyde.

   Oh wait, wait. Maybe the first reaction is the acid-catalyzed formation of an enol. Wait, but BF3 is a Lewis acid, so maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation? But propionaldehyde isn't an aromatic compound. Alternatively, maybe it's a Claisen-Schmidt condensation? No, that typically involves aldehydes and ketones under basic conditions.

   Wait, another angle: Propionaldehyde (propanal) under acidic conditions (BF3) could form a more reactive species. Alternatively, perhaps this is a way to form a propargyl alcohol or something else. Hmm, not sure. Maybe I should move on and see if future steps clarify.

2. **A + BuLi → B**
   BuLi is a strong base, often used to deprotonate compounds to form enolates or to add to carbonyl groups. So if A is an aldehyde or a ketone, reacting with BuLi would deprotonate it. Alternatively, if A is an enol ether or something else, BuLi might abstract a proton.

   Wait, maybe the first step forms an aldehyde chloride. No, that doesn't make sense with BF3. Alternatively, maybe the first step is the formation of a propargyl bromide via some mechanism. Hmm, not sure.

   Let me think again. Propionaldehyde has the structure RCHO. Reacting with BF3 (a Lewis acid) might lead to the formation of an oxonium ion, making the aldehyde more electrophilic. But what would EDT bring to the table? Oh wait, maybe EDT is ethyl diethyl tin, which is used in the Wittig reaction. Wait, no, the Wittig reagent is usually prepared from triphenylphosphine, an alkyl halide, and a strong base. Hmm.

   Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a conjugate addition. If the aldehyde is converted into an enol, and then some addition occurs. I'm a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about each step in order.

3. **A + BuLi → B**
   If A is an aldehyde, then treating with BuLi would form an enolate. So B would be an enolate, perhaps an enol ether or an alkoxide. But wait, BuLi is a strong base and can deprotonate aldehydes. So propionaldehyde (propanal) has alpha hydrogens (the CH2 group). Deprotonating would give an enolate: CH2=C(-O-)Li+ -CH3? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the enolate is CH2CH2C(O-) Li+? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

4. **B + Bromoethane → C**
   Bromoethane is CH2BrCH3. So if B is an enolate, which has a negative charge on the oxygen and a double bond adjacent, adding bromoethane would be an alkylation. Wait, but enolates are strong bases and can undergo alkylation. So in the presence of an alkyl halide like bromoethane, the enolate would attack the electrophilic carbon in an SN2 reaction. So the enolate (which is a conjugate base with a negative charge on the alpha carbon) would attack the bromoethane's CH2. So the product would have an additional ethyl group attached to the alpha carbon.

   Wait, but let me think. The enolate structure is something like CH2=C-O^- -Li+, right? So when it attacks bromoethane, the ethyl group would add to the alpha carbon. So propionaldehyde's structure is CH3CH2CHO. After deprotonation, the enolate would be CH2=C(-O-)Li+ CH2CH3. Then, adding bromoethane (CH2BrCH3), the enolate would attack the CH2Br, replacing Br with the enolate's carbon. So the product would have an ethyl group added to the alpha position.

   Wait, but propionaldehyde is CH3CH2CHO. The alpha carbons are the CH2 next to the aldehyde. Deprotonating would give an enolate like CH2=C(O-)Li+ CH2CH3. Then alkylation with bromoethane would substitute the Br with the enolate's carbon, adding an ethyl group to the alpha position. So the structure after alkylation (compound C) would be CH2CH2CH2-O- ... wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

   Alternatively, perhaps the enolate attacks the bromoethane, leading to the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond. So the enolate would have a double bond between the alpha and beta carbons. So when the enolate attacks, the ethyl group would add to the alpha carbon, making it a more substituted structure. So after alkylation, the structure would be CH2CH2CH2-O^- ... Hmm, not entirely clear, but I think that after alkylation, the molecule gains an ethyl group at the alpha position.

5. **C + HgCl2 / H2O / H+ → D**
   HgCl2 in aqueous acidic conditions is the mercury(II) ion, which is typically used in the oxymercuration reaction. Oxymercuration adds a hydroxyl group to the less substituted carbon in an anti-Markovnikov fashion. Wait, but compound C is from the alkylation of the enolate. So if C is an alkylated enolate, perhaps C is now a ketone or another carbonyl compound.

   Wait, let's think again. The enolate (B) is treated with bromoethane to form C. So maybe C is a secondary or tertiary alcohol after acid workup? Or perhaps C is a more substituted carbonyl compound.

   Alternatively, perhaps compound C is an alkoxy species. Hmm, maybe I should think about the overall process.

   Wait, step 4: after enolate alkylation, the product would have an ethyl group added to the alpha position. Then, in step 5, HgCl2 and H2O with acid. Oxymercuration typically adds a hydroxyl group to an alkene. So perhaps compound C is an alkene, and in step 5, we're adding an -OH group in an anti-Markovnikov fashion.

   So perhaps compound C is an alkene, which upon oxymercuration forms an alcohol (D).

6. **D + PPh3 / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**
   Now, looking at this step. PPh3 is triphenylphosphine, which is often used in the Staudinger reaction or in the Mitsunobu reaction. However, when combined with an alkyl halide and a strong base, it might be part of a different reaction, possibly a substitution or an elimination.

   Wait, 3-bromopentane is an alkyl bromide. BuLi is a strong base. So perhaps this is an example of the Corey-Fuchs reaction, or maybe it's a conjugate addition. Alternatively, think about a possible elimination reaction.

   But maybe the reaction is a substitution where the bromide is replaced by another group. Or perhaps PPh3 is involved in a Mitsunobu reaction, which typically converts an alcohol into another group, like an ether or an alkyne.

   Wait, Mitsunobu reaction involves an alcohol, an aryl phosphine, and a diethyl azodicarboxylate (DEAD) or similar. It's used to transfer substituents, for example, converting an alcohol into a bromide or another leaving group. But in this case, the reagents are PPh3, 3-bromopentane, and BuLi. Hmm, not sure.

   Alternatively, perhaps it's a SN2 substitution where the BuLi deprotonates something, making a better nucleophile. Or perhaps the BuLi is used to deprotonate an alkyllithium species, but that seems a bit off.

   Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Grignard-like addition. But I'm not certain. Maybe this step is a substitution where the bromide is replaced by a larger group.

But I'm getting a bit stuck, so perhaps I should start mapping out the structures step by step.

Let me try to outline the possible structures:

1. **Starting with Propionaldehyde (propanal): CH3CH2CHO**

2. **Reaction with EDT and BF3 to form A**
   EDT is probably ethyl diethyl tin, which is used in the Wittig reaction. The Wittig reagent (ylide) is typically generated from an alkyl halide, triphenylphosphine, and a strong base. Wait, but the question says the reagents are EDT and BF3. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a variation where BF3 acts as a Lewis acid catalyst in a different reaction, perhaps a alkylation or acylation.

   Alternatively, perhaps the first step is the formation of an acetal or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's the formation of a propargyl bromide via the Hell-Volhard-Zelinskii reaction, but that usually involves alpha bromination of carboxylic acids, which doesn't fit here.

   Wait, another thought: propionaldehyde (propanal) under acidic conditions (BF3) might form a more activated carbonyl, which could undergo some kind of substitution. But I'm not sure.

   Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a Corey-Fuchs reaction, but I'm not certain.

   Hmm. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Let me think about each step again.

   Step 1: Propionaldehyde (CH3CH2CHO) reacts with EDT and BF3 to give A.

   Wait, another possibility: the reaction is the formation of a propargyl alcohol. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a conjugate addition.

   Alternatively, perhaps A is a propargyl bromide. Wait, but how?

   Alternatively, I might be overcomplicating things. Let's try moving forward.

Assuming that after step 1, A is some kind of enol ether or another compound. Then, step 2 adds BuLi, which is a strong base, abstracting a proton to form an enolate in B.

Step 3: alkylation with bromoethane to form C.

Then, step 4: oxymercuration to form D.

Step 5: reaction with PPh3, 3-bromopentane, BuLi to form E.

Wait, perhaps each step is building up the structure towards a more complex molecule.

Let me try to think about what each step does.

Propionaldehyde → step 1 → A.

If step 1 is a Wittig-like reaction, A would be an alkene. For example, the Wittig reaction converts aldehydes/ketones into alkenes. But the reagents here are EDT and BF3, which I'm not sure about. Wait, maybe the reaction is the formation of an ylide. Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is the formation of an alkyne via the Cadiot-Chodkiewicz coupling, but that typically involves Grignard reagents and ketones, not aldehydes.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is the formation of a propargyl alcohol via a conjugate addition.

Wait, perhaps the first reaction is the formation of a propargyl bromide. But I'm not clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is the formation of a propyl Grignard reagent. But without Mg metal, I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps EDT is another reagent. Wait, perhaps it's a typo, and it's meant to be something else. For example, maybe it's a base like a diazocompound? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction is an acid-catalyzed dehydration of propionaldehyde to form an alkene. But propionaldehyde (propanal) doesn't have enough adjacent hydrogens to form an alkene via dehydration; that usually requires a beta hydrogen, which it does have. Wait, propanal is CH3CH2CHO. The alpha carbon (the CH2 next to the aldehyde) has two H's. Wait, so perhaps under acidic conditions, it could form an enol, which might then lose water to form an alkene.

But wait, propanal has the structure CH3CH2CHO. The alpha carbon is the CH2 group next to the aldehyde. So if it loses a water molecule, you would form an alkene. So propanal → propene? But propene is CH2=CHCH3, which would require losing a H from the CH2 group. Wait, but in that case, the structure would be CH2=CH-OH, which doesn't seem right. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is the formation of a propargyl alcohol via a hydroboration reaction. But I'm not sure.

This is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should shift focus and think about what each step does in a typical organic chemistry context.

1. Propionaldehyde to A: Maybe it's a condensation reaction, but without more info, hard to say. Let's assume for now that A is an enol ether or an aldehyde with an added substituent.

2. A + BuLi → B: BuLi is a strong base, so it would deprotonate A. If A is an enol ether, perhaps B is the enolate. Alternatively, if A is an aldehyde, BuLi would form an enolate.

3. B + bromoethane → C: Alkylation of the enolate, adding an ethyl group to the alpha position. So, if the original structure was CH3CH2CHO, after alkylation, the structure would be CH2CH2CH2CHO, but wait, that seems not right. Maybe the structure becomes CH2CH2CH2CH2O-... No, perhaps the enolate has a double bond, so when you add an ethyl group, you get a more substituted double bond.

Wait, perhaps the first step is the formation of an enol. So propanal (CH3CH2CHO) under acidic conditions forms the enol, which is CH2=CHCH2O-. Then, when treated with BuLi, which is a strong base, perhaps it deprotonates to form an enolate, which would have a negative charge on the oxygen and a double bond between the first and second carbons.

Then, when you add bromoethane (CH2BrCH3), the enolate (a strong base) would attack the bromoethane in an SN2 reaction, substituting Br with the enolate's carbon. So the enolate's carbon (the alpha carbon) would get an ethyl group. So the structure would become CH2CH2CH2-O-... Wait, perhaps the structure becomes CH2CH2CH2CHO but with an ethyl group added.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to sketch it out.

Original structure: CH3CH2CHO (propanal)

Step 1: React with BF3 and EDT. Let's say it's a conjugate addition, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it could be forming an enol.

Step 2: React with BuLi → forms an enolate.

Enolate structure: CH2=C(O-)Li+ CH2CH3.

Step 3: Alkylation with bromoethane.

The enolate has a negatively charged carbon (alpha position) which attacks the bromoethane's CH2Br. So the ethyl group (CH2CH3) adds to the alpha carbon.

So after the attack, the structure would be CH2CH2CH2-O- ... Wait, perhaps the structure becomes CH2CH2CH2O- with an ethyl group attached.

Wait, perhaps the alkylation leads to a more substituted double bond. So the initial enolate was CH2=C-O- Li+ CH2CH3.

After alkylation, the structure becomes CH2CH2CH2-O- Li+ ?, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the enolate attacks the bromoethane, leading to a new carbon chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkylation adds an ethyl group to the alpha position of the original aldehyde.

So after alkylation, the structure would be CH2CH2CH2CHO, but that doesn't seem right because the aldehyde is still present. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe after alkylation, the structure is CH2CH2CH2OCH2CH3 (an ether), but I'm not certain.

Moving on, perhaps after alkylation, in step 4, HgCl2 and H2O with H+ would perform oxymercuration on an alkene, adding an -OH group.

So if compound C is an alkene, then D would be the corresponding alcohol.

But if C is an alkene, then D would be a secondary or tertiary alcohol, depending on the structure.

Then in step 5, D reacts with PPh3, 3-bromopentane, and BuLi to form E.

Hmm, perhaps this is a substitution or elimination reaction.

Wait, another thought: PPh3 and an alkyl halide with a strong base like BuLi could form a Grignard-like reagent, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a Mitsunobu reaction. The Mitsunobu reaction typically converts an alcohol into another group, such as another alcohol, ether, or alkyne. The reagents for Mitsunobu are usually triphenylphosphine, an azodicarboxylate (like DEAD), and a substituted alcohol. But in this case, the reagents are PPh3, 3-bromopentane, and BuLi.

Wait, 3-bromopentane is CH2CH2CHBrCH2CH3. So perhaps in this step, the OH group in D is being replaced by a pentyl group.

So, in D, if we have an alcohol (-OH), perhaps the Mitsunobu reaction is converting the -OH into a bromide, which is then displaced by the BuLi. But I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the -OH is replaced by a larger group.

Alternatively, perhaps the triphenylphosphine is being used in a Staudinger reaction, but that involves azides, which aren't present here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction. But I'm not sure.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to sketch out the entire process.

Let me try to outline the possible structures step by step.

1. **Step 1: Propionaldehyde (CH3CH2CHO) + EDT/BF3 → A**
   Assuming that A is an enol. Structure after step 1: CH2=CHCH2O- (but probably as an oxonium ion under acidic conditions).

2. **Step 2: A + BuLi → B**
   BuLi deprotonates the alpha hydrogen (maybe the H in CH2=CH-) to form an enolate. Structure of B: CH2=C(-O-)Li+ -CH2CH3.

3. **Step 3: B + bromoethane → C**
   The enolate (nucleophile) attacks bromoethane (CH2BrCH3) in an SN2 reaction. The ethyl group adds to the alpha carbon. So the structure becomes CH2CH2CH2-O- (but with an ethyl group added to the alpha carbon). Wait, perhaps the structure becomes CH2CH2CH2-O-CH2CH3? No, that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, the addition leads to a longer chain.

   Alternatively, perhaps the enolate adds an ethyl group to the alpha carbon, making the structure CH2CH2CH2CHO. But that doesn't seem right because the aldehyde is still present.

   Wait, perhaps the aldehyde is converted into a ketone? No, propionaldehyde is an aldehyde; without a beta hydrogen, it's tricky.

   Alternatively, perhaps the enolate addition leads to a new carbon chain. Another possibility is that the enolate's carbon attacks the bromoethane, leading to a new structure where the ethyl group is attached to the alpha carbon. So the structure would be CH2CH2CH2O−, but I'm not entirely certain.

I think I'm stuck on the third step. Maybe I should instead think about the overall process. The overall series of reactions might be constructing a more complex molecule, perhaps with multiple stereocenters or branching.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product E is a bicyclic compound or something with multiple substituents leading to a complex NMR spectrum.

But given that the question asks for the number of 13C NMR signals, I need to determine how many unique carbon environments are present in E.

Assuming that the process builds up a molecule with several equivalent carbons and several nonequivalent ones, the number of signals would reflect the symmetry in the molecule.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. Therefore, perhaps I should try to think of each step leading to a specific functional group.

Alternative approach: Think about each reaction as a known transformation.

Step 1: Propionaldehyde + BF3 and something → A.

Another possibility: BF3 is used as a catalyst for Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that's for aromatic compounds. So perhaps this isn't the case.

Wait, maybe the first step is the formation of a propargyl alcohol via acid-catalyzed hydration of an alkyne. But I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is the formation of a propenol (allyl alcohol) via a conjugate addition. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is the formation of an ylide, which would then react in a Wittig-like reaction. But without Mg, that's unclear.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about each step in a different way.

Step 4: HgCl2 in H2O and H+ → oxymercuration.

Oxymercuration adds an -OH group to the less substituted carbon of an alkene in an anti-Markovnikov fashion. So if compound C is an alkene, then D would be an alcohol with the OH group added to the less substituted end.

So perhaps in step 3, compound C is an alkene, and step 4 adds an OH group in anti-Markovnikov fashion.

Then, in step 5, D reacts with PPh3, 3-bromopentane, and BuLi to form E.

So perhaps D is an alcohol, and the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution, replacing the OH with a larger group, such as a pentyl group.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the OH is being protected or modified.

Alternatively, step 5 could be a Mitsunobu reaction, which would transfer the -OH group into another substituent, such as an ether or a nitrile.

Wait, in Mitsunobu, the OH is replaced by another group. The typical setup uses DEAD (diethyl azodicarboxylate) and a phosphine (like PPh3) to transfer the substituent. But here, the reagents are PPh3, 3-bromopentane, and BuLi. So perhaps the bromine in 3-bromopentane is acting as a leaving group, and the BuLi is providing a strong base.

Wait, maybe the reaction is an SN2 substitution where the OH group is replaced by a pentyl group. But why would BuLi be present? BuLi is a strong base, so perhaps it's deprotonating something to form a better nucleophile.

Alternatively, perhaps the BuLi is used to form a lithium alkoxide, which then displaces the bromide in 3-bromopentane. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a coupling reaction, such as a Suzuki or Stille, but without a proper coupling partner (like a boronic acid), I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Grignard addition, where the BuLi is generating a lithio species, but that's speculation.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Given that the question is about the number of 13C NMR signals, I can think about how each step adds complexity to the molecule, leading to more distinct carbon environments.

Assuming that step 4 forms an alcohol with a certain structure and step 5 adds another substituent, the final molecule E could have several unique carbons.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's challenging. However, the options are 3, 6, 8, 11. 11 seems high, 3 seems low, so perhaps 6 or 8.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a complex molecule with multiple chiral centers, leading to more signals.

Wait, another thought: the initial compound is propionaldehyde, which is a straight chain. Each reaction could be adding substituents, leading to branching. For example, after alkylation, the molecule becomes more branched, increasing the number of unique carbons.

If the final product has multiple methyl groups, methylene groups, and possibly some quaternary carbons, the NMR would show distinct signals for each type.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a bicyclic molecule with several unique carbons.

But I'm not making much progress. Maybe I should try to outline the possible structures again.

Wait, another approach: perhaps each step adds a new functional group or substituent.

Step 1: Propionaldehyde → A. Maybe A is a ketone? How? Wait, propionaldehyde doesn't directly become a ketone under BF3 conditions. Alternatively, perhaps it undergoes some kind of oxidation or reduction. But I'm not sure.

Step 2: A treated with BuLi → enolate B.

Step 3: Alkylation → C.

Step 4: Oxymercuration → D.

Step 5: Mitsunobu-like reaction → E.

Wait, perhaps the overall process is building a molecule with multiple rings or branches, leading to a high number of NMR signals.

Alternatively, maybe E is a decalin derivative, which would have several unique carbons.

But without knowing the exact structure, I'm stuck. So perhaps I should make an educated guess.

Looking at the options, the number of signals is likely to be moderate. If the molecule has several substituents leading to multiple unique carbons, perhaps 6 or 8.

Another angle: 13C NMR counts each unique carbon environment. So if E has, say, a benzene ring with substituents, each position would give a signal. But given the starting material is propionaldehyde, it's unlikely to involve aromatic compounds.

Alternatively, E could be a diol, an ether, or another functional group with several substituents.

Wait, another approach: perhaps each step adds a new substituent, leading to branching. So the initial structure is a straight chain, then each reaction adds a branch, increasing the number of unique carbons.

If the final product has 8 unique carbons, that would correspond to option A.

But without more information, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 6 signals.

But I'm not confident here. Given the options, I think the answer is B)6. But I'm not certain.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the number of 13C-NMR signals for compound E, the final product of a multi-step reaction sequence starting from propionaldehyde. Each step in the reaction sequence is analyzed as follows:

1. **Reaction of propionaldehyde with EDT and BF3**: The exact nature of this step is unclear due to ambiguity in the reagents. Possible interpretations include the formation of an enol, an enolate, or a modified aldehyde structure. Without further details, the structure of compound A remains uncertain.

2. **Reaction of A with BuLi**: BuLi, a strong base, likely deprotonates A to form an enolate (compound B). If A is an enol or aldehyde, the enolate would have a negative charge on the oxygen and a double bond adjacent to the alpha carbon.

3. **Reaction of B with bromoethane**: This step involves alkylation of the enolate. The enolate acts as a nucleophile, attacking bromoethane in an SN2 reaction. This adds an ethyl group to the alpha carbon, forming compound C. The exact structure of C depends on the nature of B, but it likely contains an ethyl substituent at the alpha position.

4. **Reaction of C with HgCl2, H2O, and H+**: These conditions suggest oxymercuration, where an -OH group is added to the less substituted carbon of an alkene in an anti-Markovnikov fashion. This forms compound D, which is likely an alcohol.

5. **Reaction of D with PPh3, 3-bromopentane, and BuLi**: This step is ambiguous. Possible interpretations include a substitution reaction, a Mitsunobu-like transformation, or the formation of a Grignard-like reagent. The exact nature of this reaction determines the final structure of E.

Given the uncertainty in the exact structures at each step, the final product E is assumed to have a complex structure with multiple unique carbon environments. Based on the options provided (A: 8, B: 6, C: 11, D: 3), the most reasonable estimate for the number of 13C-NMR signals is **6**, assuming moderate branching and symmetry in the molecule.

Answer: B

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of NMR spectroscopy and reaction mechanisms. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about identifying the number of 13C-NMR signals in compound E, which is the product of a series of reactions starting from propionaldehyde. The options are A)8, B)6, C)11, D)3. I need to figure out each step of the reaction pathway and then determine the structure of E to analyze its carbon environment.

First, let's break down each reaction step.

1. **Propionaldehyde + EDT/BF3 → A**
   Propionaldehyde is CH3CH2CHO. I remember that BF3 is a Lewis acid catalyst. EDT might be something else, but wait, I think EDT is ethyl diisopropyl tin. Oh wait, another possibility: EDT is ethyl diazomethane? Or maybe it's a typo, perhaps it's something else. Hmm, wait, maybe I'm confusing the abbreviations. Alternatively, I recall that BF3 is used in certain aldehyde reactions, maybe the formation of enolates.

   Alternatively, another thought: when an aldehyde reacts with a base like BF3·THF (which is a Lewis acid), it can form an enol. Oh wait, maybe it's a conjugate addition or something else. Wait, another possibility: the reaction is the formation of an enolate. Propionaldehyde is an aldehyde, and when treated with a strong base, like maybe BuLi, but wait the first reagent is EDT and BF3. Hmm, perhaps it's a variation of the Bayer-Villiger oxidation, but I don't think that's it because I think that requires a ketone, not an aldehyde.

   Oh wait, wait. Maybe the first reaction is the acid-catalyzed formation of an enol. Wait, but BF3 is a Lewis acid, so maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation? But propionaldehyde isn't an aromatic compound. Alternatively, maybe it's a Claisen-Schmidt condensation? No, that typically involves aldehydes and ketones under basic conditions.

   Wait, another angle: Propionaldehyde (propanal) under acidic conditions (BF3) could form a more reactive species. Alternatively, perhaps this is a way to form a propargyl alcohol or something else. Hmm, not sure. Maybe I should move on and see if future steps clarify.

2. **A + BuLi → B**
   BuLi is a strong base, often used to deprotonate compounds to form enolates or to add to carbonyl groups. So if A is an aldehyde or a ketone, reacting with BuLi would deprotonate it. Alternatively, if A is an enol ether or something else, BuLi might abstract a proton.

   Wait, maybe the first step forms an aldehyde chloride. No, that doesn't make sense with BF3. Alternatively, maybe the first step is the formation of a propargyl bromide via some mechanism. Hmm, not sure.

   Let me think again. Propionaldehyde has the structure RCHO. Reacting with BF3 (a Lewis acid) might lead to the formation of an oxonium ion, making the aldehyde more electrophilic. But what would EDT bring to the table? Oh wait, maybe EDT is ethyl diethyl tin, which is used in the Wittig reaction. Wait, no, the Wittig reagent is usually prepared from triphenylphosphine, an alkyl halide, and a strong base. Hmm.

   Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a conjugate addition. If the aldehyde is converted into an enol, and then some addition occurs. I'm a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about each step in order.

3. **A + BuLi → B**
   If A is an aldehyde, then treating with BuLi would form an enolate. So B would be an enolate, perhaps an enol ether or an alkoxide. But wait, BuLi is a strong base and can deprotonate aldehydes. So propionaldehyde (propanal) has alpha hydrogens (the CH2 group). Deprotonating would give an enolate: CH2=C(-O-)Li+ -CH3? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the enolate is CH2CH2C(O-) Li+? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

4. **B + Bromoethane → C**
   Bromoethane is CH2BrCH3. So if B is an enolate, which has a negative charge on the oxygen and a double bond adjacent, adding bromoethane would be an alkylation. Wait, but enolates are strong bases and can undergo alkylation. So in the presence of an alkyl halide like bromoethane, the enolate would attack the electrophilic carbon in an SN2 reaction. So the enolate (which is a conjugate base with a negative charge on the alpha carbon) would attack the bromoethane's CH2. So the product would have an additional ethyl group attached to the alpha carbon.

   Wait, but let me think. The enolate structure is something like CH2=C-O^- -Li+, right? So when it attacks bromoethane, the ethyl group would add to the alpha carbon. So propionaldehyde's structure is CH3CH2CHO. After deprotonation, the enolate would be CH2=C(-O-)Li+ CH2CH3. Then, adding bromoethane (CH2BrCH3), the enolate would attack the CH2Br, replacing Br with the enolate's carbon. So the product would have an ethyl group added to the alpha position.

   Wait, but propionaldehyde is CH3CH2CHO. The alpha carbons are the CH2 next to the aldehyde. Deprotonating would give an enolate like CH2=C(O-)Li+ CH2CH3. Then alkylation with bromoethane would substitute the Br with the enolate's carbon, adding an ethyl group to the alpha position. So the structure after alkylation (compound C) would be CH2CH2CH2-O- ... wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

   Alternatively, perhaps the enolate attacks the bromoethane, leading to the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond. So the enolate would have a double bond between the alpha and beta carbons. So when the enolate attacks, the ethyl group would add to the alpha carbon, making it a more substituted structure. So after alkylation, the structure would be CH2CH2CH2-O^- ... Hmm, not entirely clear, but I think that after alkylation, the molecule gains an ethyl group at the alpha position.

5. **C + HgCl2 / H2O / H+ → D**
   HgCl2 in aqueous acidic conditions is the mercury(II) ion, which is typically used in the oxymercuration reaction. Oxymercuration adds a hydroxyl group to the less substituted carbon in an anti-Markovnikov fashion. Wait, but compound C is from the alkylation of the enolate. So if C is an alkylated enolate, perhaps C is now a ketone or another carbonyl compound.

   Wait, let's think again. The enolate (B) is treated with bromoethane to form C. So maybe C is a secondary or tertiary alcohol after acid workup? Or perhaps C is a more substituted carbonyl compound.

   Alternatively, perhaps compound C is an alkoxy species. Hmm, maybe I should think about the overall process.

   Wait, step 4: after enolate alkylation, the product would have an ethyl group added to the alpha position. Then, in step 5, HgCl2 and H2O with acid. Oxymercuration typically adds a hydroxyl group to an alkene. So perhaps compound C is an alkene, and in step 5, we're adding an -OH group in an anti-Markovnikov fashion.

   So perhaps compound C is an alkene, which upon oxymercuration forms an alcohol (D).

6. **D + PPh3 / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**
   Now, looking at this step. PPh3 is triphenylphosphine, which is often used in the Staudinger reaction or in the Mitsunobu reaction. However, when combined with an alkyl halide and a strong base, it might be part of a different reaction, possibly a substitution or an elimination.

   Wait, 3-bromopentane is an alkyl bromide. BuLi is a strong base. So perhaps this is an example of the Corey-Fuchs reaction, or maybe it's a conjugate addition. Alternatively, think about a possible elimination reaction.

   But maybe the reaction is a substitution where the bromide is replaced by another group. Or perhaps PPh3 is involved in a Mitsunobu reaction, which typically converts an alcohol into another group, like an ether or an alkyne.

   Wait, Mitsunobu reaction involves an alcohol, an aryl phosphine, and a diethyl azodicarboxylate (DEAD) or similar. It's used to transfer substituents, for example, converting an alcohol into a bromide or another leaving group. But in this case, the reagents are PPh3, 3-bromopentane, and BuLi. Hmm, not sure.

   Alternatively, perhaps it's a SN2 substitution where the BuLi deprotonates something, making a better nucleophile. Or perhaps the BuLi is used to deprotonate an alkyllithium species, but that seems a bit off.

   Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Grignard-like addition. But I'm not certain. Maybe this step is a substitution where the bromide is replaced by a larger group.

But I'm getting a bit stuck, so perhaps I should start mapping out the structures step by step.

Let me try to outline the possible structures:

1. **Starting with Propionaldehyde (propanal): CH3CH2CHO**

2. **Reaction with EDT and BF3 to form A**
   EDT is probably ethyl diethyl tin, which is used in the Wittig reaction. The Wittig reagent (ylide) is typically generated from an alkyl halide, triphenylphosphine, and a strong base. Wait, but the question says the reagents are EDT and BF3. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a variation where BF3 acts as a Lewis acid catalyst in a different reaction, perhaps a alkylation or acylation.

   Alternatively, perhaps the first step is the formation of an acetal or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's the formation of a propargyl bromide via the Hell-Volhard-Zelinskii reaction, but that usually involves alpha bromination of carboxylic acids, which doesn't fit here.

   Wait, another thought: propionaldehyde (propanal) under acidic conditions (BF3) might form a more activated carbonyl, which could undergo some kind of substitution. But I'm not sure.

   Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a Corey-Fuchs reaction, but I'm not certain.

   Hmm. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Let me think about each step again.

   Step 1: Propionaldehyde (CH3CH2CHO) reacts with EDT and BF3 to give A.

   Wait, another possibility: the reaction is the formation of a propargyl alcohol. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a conjugate addition.

   Alternatively, perhaps A is a propargyl bromide. Wait, but how?

   Alternatively, I might be overcomplicating things. Let's try moving forward.

Assuming that after step 1, A is some kind of enol ether or another compound. Then, step 2 adds BuLi, which is a strong base, abstracting a proton to form an enolate in B.

Step 3: alkylation with bromoethane to form C.

Then, step 4: oxymercuration to form D.

Step 5: reaction with PPh3, 3-bromopentane, BuLi to form E.

Wait, perhaps each step is building up the structure towards a more complex molecule.

Let me try to think about what each step does.

Propionaldehyde → step 1 → A.

If step 1 is a Wittig-like reaction, A would be an alkene. For example, the Wittig reaction converts aldehydes/ketones into alkenes. But the reagents here are EDT and BF3, which I'm not sure about. Wait, maybe the reaction is the formation of an ylide. Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is the formation of an alkyne via the Cadiot-Chodkiewicz coupling, but that typically involves Grignard reagents and ketones, not aldehydes.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is the formation of a propargyl alcohol via a conjugate addition.

Wait, perhaps the first reaction is the formation of a propargyl bromide. But I'm not clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is the formation of a propyl Grignard reagent. But without Mg metal, I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps EDT is another reagent. Wait, perhaps it's a typo, and it's meant to be something else. For example, maybe it's a base like a diazocompound? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction is an acid-catalyzed dehydration of propionaldehyde to form an alkene. But propionaldehyde (propanal) doesn't have enough adjacent hydrogens to form an alkene via dehydration; that usually requires a beta hydrogen, which it does have. Wait, propanal is CH3CH2CHO. The alpha carbon (the CH2 next to the aldehyde) has two H's. Wait, so perhaps under acidic conditions, it could form an enol, which might then lose water to form an alkene.

But wait, propanal has the structure CH3CH2CHO. The alpha carbon is the CH2 group next to the aldehyde. So if it loses a water molecule, you would form an alkene. So propanal → propene? But propene is CH2=CHCH3, which would require losing a H from the CH2 group. Wait, but in that case, the structure would be CH2=CH-OH, which doesn't seem right. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is the formation of a propargyl alcohol via a hydroboration reaction. But I'm not sure.

This is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should shift focus and think about what each step does in a typical organic chemistry context.

1. Propionaldehyde to A: Maybe it's a condensation reaction, but without more info, hard to say. Let's assume for now that A is an enol ether or an aldehyde with an added substituent.

2. A + BuLi → B: BuLi is a strong base, so it would deprotonate A. If A is an enol ether, perhaps B is the enolate. Alternatively, if A is an aldehyde, BuLi would form an enolate.

3. B + bromoethane → C: Alkylation of the enolate, adding an ethyl group to the alpha position. So, if the original structure was CH3CH2CHO, after alkylation, the structure would be CH2CH2CH2CHO, but wait, that seems not right. Maybe the structure becomes CH2CH2CH2CH2O-... No, perhaps the enolate has a double bond, so when you add an ethyl group, you get a more substituted double bond.

Wait, perhaps the first step is the formation of an enol. So propanal (CH3CH2CHO) under acidic conditions forms the enol, which is CH2=CHCH2O-. Then, when treated with BuLi, which is a strong base, perhaps it deprotonates to form an enolate, which would have a negative charge on the oxygen and a double bond between the first and second carbons.

Then, when you add bromoethane (CH2BrCH3), the enolate (a strong base) would attack the bromoethane in an SN2 reaction, substituting Br with the enolate's carbon. So the enolate's carbon (the alpha carbon) would get an ethyl group. So the structure would become CH2CH2CH2-O-... Wait, perhaps the structure becomes CH2CH2CH2CHO but with an ethyl group added.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to sketch it out.

Original structure: CH3CH2CHO (propanal)

Step 1: React with BF3 and EDT. Let's say it's a conjugate addition, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it could be forming an enol.

Step 2: React with BuLi → forms an enolate.

Enolate structure: CH2=C(O-)Li+ CH2CH3.

Step 3: Alkylation with bromoethane.

The enolate has a negatively charged carbon (alpha position) which attacks the bromoethane's CH2Br. So the ethyl group (CH2CH3) adds to the alpha carbon.

So after the attack, the structure would be CH2CH2CH2-O- ... Wait, perhaps the structure becomes CH2CH2CH2O- with an ethyl group attached.

Wait, perhaps the alkylation leads to a more substituted double bond. So the initial enolate was CH2=C-O- Li+ CH2CH3.

After alkylation, the structure becomes CH2CH2CH2-O- Li+ ?, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the enolate attacks the bromoethane, leading to a new carbon chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkylation adds an ethyl group to the alpha position of the original aldehyde.

So after alkylation, the structure would be CH2CH2CH2CHO, but that doesn't seem right because the aldehyde is still present. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe after alkylation, the structure is CH2CH2CH2OCH2CH3 (an ether), but I'm not certain.

Moving on, perhaps after alkylation, in step 4, HgCl2 and H2O with H+ would perform oxymercuration on an alkene, adding an -OH group.

So if compound C is an alkene, then D would be the corresponding alcohol.

But if C is an alkene, then D would be a secondary or tertiary alcohol, depending on the structure.

Then in step 5, D reacts with PPh3, 3-bromopentane, and BuLi to form E.

Hmm, perhaps this is a substitution or elimination reaction.

Wait, another thought: PPh3 and an alkyl halide with a strong base like BuLi could form a Grignard-like reagent, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a Mitsunobu reaction. The Mitsunobu reaction typically converts an alcohol into another group, such as another alcohol, ether, or alkyne. The reagents for Mitsunobu are usually triphenylphosphine, an azodicarboxylate (like DEAD), and a substituted alcohol. But in this case, the reagents are PPh3, 3-bromopentane, and BuLi.

Wait, 3-bromopentane is CH2CH2CHBrCH2CH3. So perhaps in this step, the OH group in D is being replaced by a pentyl group.

So, in D, if we have an alcohol (-OH), perhaps the Mitsunobu reaction is converting the -OH into a bromide, which is then displaced by the BuLi. But I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the -OH is replaced by a larger group.

Alternatively, perhaps the triphenylphosphine is being used in a Staudinger reaction, but that involves azides, which aren't present here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction. But I'm not sure.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to sketch out the entire process.

Let me try to outline the possible structures step by step.

1. **Step 1: Propionaldehyde (CH3CH2CHO) + EDT/BF3 → A**
   Assuming that A is an enol. Structure after step 1: CH2=CHCH2O- (but probably as an oxonium ion under acidic conditions).

2. **Step 2: A + BuLi → B**
   BuLi deprotonates the alpha hydrogen (maybe the H in CH2=CH-) to form an enolate. Structure of B: CH2=C(-O-)Li+ -CH2CH3.

3. **Step 3: B + bromoethane → C**
   The enolate (nucleophile) attacks bromoethane (CH2BrCH3) in an SN2 reaction. The ethyl group adds to the alpha carbon. So the structure becomes CH2CH2CH2-O- (but with an ethyl group added to the alpha carbon). Wait, perhaps the structure becomes CH2CH2CH2-O-CH2CH3? No, that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, the addition leads to a longer chain.

   Alternatively, perhaps the enolate adds an ethyl group to the alpha carbon, making the structure CH2CH2CH2CHO. But that doesn't seem right because the aldehyde is still present.

   Wait, perhaps the aldehyde is converted into a ketone? No, propionaldehyde is an aldehyde; without a beta hydrogen, it's tricky.

   Alternatively, perhaps the enolate addition leads to a new carbon chain. Another possibility is that the enolate's carbon attacks the bromoethane, leading to a new structure where the ethyl group is attached to the alpha carbon. So the structure would be CH2CH2CH2O−, but I'm not entirely certain.

I think I'm stuck on the third step. Maybe I should instead think about the overall process. The overall series of reactions might be constructing a more complex molecule, perhaps with multiple stereocenters or branching.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product E is a bicyclic compound or something with multiple substituents leading to a complex NMR spectrum.

But given that the question asks for the number of 13C NMR signals, I need to determine how many unique carbon environments are present in E.

Assuming that the process builds up a molecule with several equivalent carbons and several nonequivalent ones, the number of signals would reflect the symmetry in the molecule.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. Therefore, perhaps I should try to think of each step leading to a specific functional group.

Alternative approach: Think about each reaction as a known transformation.

Step 1: Propionaldehyde + BF3 and something → A.

Another possibility: BF3 is used as a catalyst for Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that's for aromatic compounds. So perhaps this isn't the case.

Wait, maybe the first step is the formation of a propargyl alcohol via acid-catalyzed hydration of an alkyne. But I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is the formation of a propenol (allyl alcohol) via a conjugate addition. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is the formation of an ylide, which would then react in a Wittig-like reaction. But without Mg, that's unclear.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about each step in a different way.

Step 4: HgCl2 in H2O and H+ → oxymercuration.

Oxymercuration adds an -OH group to the less substituted carbon of an alkene in an anti-Markovnikov fashion. So if compound C is an alkene, then D would be an alcohol with the OH group added to the less substituted end.

So perhaps in step 3, compound C is an alkene, and step 4 adds an OH group in anti-Markovnikov fashion.

Then, in step 5, D reacts with PPh3, 3-bromopentane, and BuLi to form E.

So perhaps D is an alcohol, and the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution, replacing the OH with a larger group, such as a pentyl group.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the OH is being protected or modified.

Alternatively, step 5 could be a Mitsunobu reaction, which would transfer the -OH group into another substituent, such as an ether or a nitrile.

Wait, in Mitsunobu, the OH is replaced by another group. The typical setup uses DEAD (diethyl azodicarboxylate) and a phosphine (like PPh3) to transfer the substituent. But here, the reagents are PPh3, 3-bromopentane, and BuLi. So perhaps the bromine in 3-bromopentane is acting as a leaving group, and the BuLi is providing a strong base.

Wait, maybe the reaction is an SN2 substitution where the OH group is replaced by a pentyl group. But why would BuLi be present? BuLi is a strong base, so perhaps it's deprotonating something to form a better nucleophile.

Alternatively, perhaps the BuLi is used to form a lithium alkoxide, which then displaces the bromide in 3-bromopentane. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a coupling reaction, such as a Suzuki or Stille, but without a proper coupling partner (like a boronic acid), I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Grignard addition, where the BuLi is generating a lithio species, but that's speculation.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Given that the question is about the number of 13C NMR signals, I can think about how each step adds complexity to the molecule, leading to more distinct carbon environments.

Assuming that step 4 forms an alcohol with a certain structure and step 5 adds another substituent, the final molecule E could have several unique carbons.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's challenging. However, the options are 3, 6, 8, 11. 11 seems high, 3 seems low, so perhaps 6 or 8.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a complex molecule with multiple chiral centers, leading to more signals.

Wait, another thought: the initial compound is propionaldehyde, which is a straight chain. Each reaction could be adding substituents, leading to branching. For example, after alkylation, the molecule becomes more branched, increasing the number of unique carbons.

If the final product has multiple methyl groups, methylene groups, and possibly some quaternary carbons, the NMR would show distinct signals for each type.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a bicyclic molecule with several unique carbons.

But I'm not making much progress. Maybe I should try to outline the possible structures again.

Wait, another approach: perhaps each step adds a new functional group or substituent.

Step 1: Propionaldehyde → A. Maybe A is a ketone? How? Wait, propionaldehyde doesn't directly become a ketone under BF3 conditions. Alternatively, perhaps it undergoes some kind of oxidation or reduction. But I'm not sure.

Step 2: A treated with BuLi → enolate B.

Step 3: Alkylation → C.

Step 4: Oxymercuration → D.

Step 5: Mitsunobu-like reaction → E.

Wait, perhaps the overall process is building a molecule with multiple rings or branches, leading to a high number of NMR signals.

Alternatively, maybe E is a decalin derivative, which would have several unique carbons.

But without knowing the exact structure, I'm stuck. So perhaps I should make an educated guess.

Looking at the options, the number of signals is likely to be moderate. If the molecule has several substituents leading to multiple unique carbons, perhaps 6 or 8.

Another angle: 13C NMR counts each unique carbon environment. So if E has, say, a benzene ring with substituents, each position would give a signal. But given the starting material is propionaldehyde, it's unlikely to involve aromatic compounds.

Alternatively, E could be a diol, an ether, or another functional group with several substituents.

Wait, another approach: perhaps each step adds a new substituent, leading to branching. So the initial structure is a straight chain, then each reaction adds a branch, increasing the number of unique carbons.

If the final product has 8 unique carbons, that would correspond to option A.

But without more information, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 6 signals.

But I'm not confident here. Given the options, I think the answer is B)6. But I'm not certain.


The problem involves determining the number of 13C-NMR signals for compound E, the final product of a multi-step reaction sequence starting from propionaldehyde. Each step in the reaction sequence is analyzed as follows:

1. **Reaction of propionaldehyde with EDT and BF3**: The exact nature of this step is unclear due to ambiguity in the reagents. Possible interpretations include the formation of an enol, an enolate, or a modified aldehyde structure. Without further details, the structure of compound A remains uncertain.

2. **Reaction of A with BuLi**: BuLi, a strong base, likely deprotonates A to form an enolate (compound B). If A is an enol or aldehyde, the enolate would have a negative charge on the oxygen and a double bond adjacent to the alpha carbon.

3. **Reaction of B with bromoethane**: This step involves alkylation of the enolate. The enolate acts as a nucleophile, attacking bromoethane in an SN2 reaction. This adds an ethyl group to the alpha carbon, forming compound C. The exact structure of C depends on the nature of B, but it likely contains an ethyl substituent at the alpha position.

4. **Reaction of C with HgCl2, H2O, and H+**: These conditions suggest oxymercuration, where an -OH group is added to the less substituted carbon of an alkene in an anti-Markovnikov fashion. This forms compound D, which is likely an alcohol.

5. **Reaction of D with PPh3, 3-bromopentane, and BuLi**: This step is ambiguous. Possible interpretations include a substitution reaction, a Mitsunobu-like transformation, or the formation of a Grignard-like reagent. The exact nature of this reaction determines the final structure of E.

Given the uncertainty in the exact structures at each step, the final product E is assumed to have a complex structure with multiple unique carbon environments. Based on the options provided (A: 8, B: 6, C: 11, D: 3), the most reasonable estimate for the number of 13C-NMR signals is **6**, assuming moderate branching and symmetry in the molecule.

Answer: B
