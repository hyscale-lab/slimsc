Alright, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis problems can be tricky. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize its structure. So, I think it's a cyclohexane ring with two substituents: one is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH)CH2- group, and the other is a formyl (CHO) group. Or wait, maybe the numbering is different. Let me think again. The name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde part is a cyclohexane ring with a -CHO group. Then, at position 1, there's a substituent: cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. So that substituent is a CH2 group attached to a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group. So the structure would have two cyclohexane rings connected. One is the main ring with the aldehyde, and the substituent is another cyclohexyl attached via a CH2-OH-CH2 group, or wait, maybe it's CH2(OH)CH2-cyclohexyl? Wait, the substituent is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl), which would be a CH2 group with a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl. So the substituent is cyclohexyl-CH(OH)-CH2- attached to the main cyclohexane ring?

Wait, maybe I should draw it out. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group where one of the hydrogens is replaced by a hydroxyl group and another by a cyclohexyl group. So like, it's a CH2 group attached to the main ring, and that CH2 has a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group attached. So the substituent is -CH(OH)-cyclohexyl? Or perhaps it's -CH2- where one H is OH and another is cyclohexyl. Oh wait, no, the substituent is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl), which is a methyl group (CH3) where one H is replaced by cyclohexyl and another by OH. So the structure would be -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl). So the main ring has a substituent at position 1 which is a CH(OH)CH2 group? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group attached to both a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group. So it's CH2(OH)(cyclohexyl). Wait, that doesn't make sense because CH2 can't have three substituents. Oh, wait, no, the substituent is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl), which would be a methyl group attached to a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl. So the substituent is CH2(OH) attached to a cyclohexyl. Wait, no, that can't be right either. Oh, perhaps it's a secondary carbon. Like, the substituent is a CH group attached to the main ring, and that CH has an OH and a cyclohexyl group. So it's -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl), making it a branching point.

So the target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a CHO group at position 1 (or wherever 1 is), and another substituent at position 1 which is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group. Wait, maybe the main ring is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, so that's a cyclohexane ring with a -CHO group. Then, at position 1 (or in the same carbon?), there's a substituent which is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. Wait, maybe the substituent is a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group attached to the same carbon as the aldehyde. So the aldehyde is on carbon 1, and that same carbon has a substituent which is a CH2 group connected to a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is like this: cyclohexanecarbaldehyde means a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO) attached. Then, at the same carbon (carbon 1), there's another substituent: a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2 group, which also has a hydroxyl group. So the structure would be, on carbon 1, a carbonyl group (CHO) and a CH2 group attached to both a hydroxyl (OH) and a cyclohexyl group. So the carbon would have three substituents: CHO, CH2-OH, and CH2-cyclohexyl? No, that can't be. Wait, the carbon can have four bonds. So maybe the structure is cyclohexane with a -CH(OH)-cyclohexyl group attached, and a -CHO group as well. So, the same carbon has both the aldehyde and the CH(OH)cyclohexyl group.

Wait, perhaps the target molecule is something like cyclohexane with two substituents on the same carbon: one is a formyl group (CHO), and the other is a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2 group that has a hydroxyl group. So the substituent is a CH2 group with an OH and a cyclohexyl. So it's a CH2(OH)(cyclohexyl) group attached to the same carbon as the aldehyde.

But I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure. Maybe I should focus on the starting material and the possible reagents to figure out the steps.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So that's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (a triple bond) attached. So it's cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group.

The target molecule seems to have a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group. So perhaps the aldehyde comes from some oxidation. Also, the substituent with the hydroxyl and cyclohexyl groups probably comes from some kind of addition or coupling reaction.

So the steps to get from ethynylcyclohexane to the target involve several reactions. Let's think about each step.

Looking at the options, the reagents vary between NaNH2, H2/Pd, Ba(OH)2, H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O, Li/liq NH3, O3, (CH3)2S, NH4OH, etc.

Option A: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; then H2/Pd; then Ba(OH)2; then H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

Option B: Steps are NaNH2, ethyl chloride; then Li/liq NH3; then O3/H2O; then NH4OH.

Option C: NaNH2, methyl chloride; H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; O3/(CH3)2S; Ba(OH)2.

Option D: NaNH2, methanol; Li/liq NH3; O3/(CH3)2S; NH4OH.

Hmm.

Let me think about each possible reagent's role.

1. NaNH2 is a strong base, often used for deprotonation. Maybe for elimination or for forming alkynes or alkenes.

2. H2 with a catalyst like Pd is hydrogenation, typically used to reduce triple bonds or double bonds. So ethynylcyclohexane (which is an alkyne) could be hydrogenated to an alkane, but that's probably not correct. Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is a substituted ethyne. So if you hydrogenate it with H2 and Pd, it would reduce to ethylcyclohexane. But perhaps using a Lindlar catalyst would hydrogenate the triple bond to a cis double bond, but the options don't specify that.

3. Ba(OH)2 is used for elimination reactions, perhaps for forming rings. Or maybe for epoxide openings, but more likely, it's used in the Birch reduction or for elimination (like in the formation of alkenes via dehydrohalogenation).

4. O3 is ozone, which is used in ozonolysis to cleave double bonds into carbonyl groups. And then (CH3)2S is a reductive workup, perhaps to prevent overoxidation.

5. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O might be for oxidation, like in the Jones oxidation, which converts alcohols to ketones or carboxylic acids, depending on the conditions.

6. NH4OH is ammonium hydroxide, maybe for workup after ozonolysis or as a base in some reactions.

So the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Let's think about what reactions could be applied.

First step in the options is NaNH2 and methyl chloride. Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. Methyl chloride (CH3Cl) is a methylating agent. So perhaps the first step is deprotonation followed by alkylation. But ethynylcyclohexane has acidic protons where? The alkyne proton is acidic. So NaNH2 would deprotonate the ethynyl group, making a cyclohexenyl lithium or something similar. Then methyl chloride would methylate it? Or perhaps it's an alkylation of the alkyne.

Wait, another possibility: the alkyne could be converted into a more reactive form. NaNH2 is a strong base, so it could deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane. The alkyne has two protons, but which one is more acidic? The terminal alkyne protons are more acidic than internal, so in ethynylcyclohexane, the triple bond is at the end, so the protons are terminal. So NaNH2 would deprotonate to form a cyclohexenyl anion, maybe. Then, when methyl chloride is added, it would alkylate the anion, adding a methyl group. So the alkyne would become a longer alkyne? No, wait, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane-C≡CH. Deprotonating would give cyclohexane-C≡C- minus, then adding CH3+ (from CH3Cl) would give cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3. So that's propargylcyclohexane or something? Wait, maybe it's forming a longer alkyne.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the first step is using NaNH2 and methyl chloride for a Grignard-like reaction, but I'm not exactly sure. Let's think: NaNH2 is used with alkyl halides to form alkynides. So, if you have ethynylcyclohexane, treating with NaNH2 might deprotonate the alkyne to form a cyclohexenyl lithium or something, but wait, ethynylcyclohexane is R-C≡CH. Deprotonating gives R-C≡C^−, which would then react with an electrophile, like methyl chloride (CH3Cl), to form R-C≡C-CH3. So the product after step 1 would be a longer alkyne: R-C≡C-CH3.

Wait, but wait. Ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexyl-ethylC≡CH? No, ethynyl is -C≡CH, so ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group. So after deprotonation, adding methyl chloride would add a methyl group to the alkyne, making it a longer alkyne. So, R-C≡C-CH3, which is 1-propynylcyclohexane? Hmm. Then, step 2 in option A is H2/Pd. So that would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond. So the alkyne becomes an alkane. So ethynylcyclohexane becomes ethylcyclohexane, but with some substitution.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting off track. Let me think about the target molecule again. It has a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group and another substituent with a cyclohexyl and hydroxyl. So perhaps the formyl group comes from oxidation of a secondary alcohol, and the substituent with cyclohexyl and hydroxyl comes from some addition.

Wait, another approach: the target's substituent is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl, which suggests a substitution where a methyl group has both a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group attached. That might come from a Grignard addition or some kind of coupling reaction.

Let me think about each option's steps.

Option C's steps are:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: as before, would add a methyl group to the alkyne, turning ethynylcyclohexane into propargylcyclohexane (maybe not exactly, but longer alkyne).

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate: hydrogenation of the triple bond to single bond. So propargyl becomes propane.

So the molecule would now be a cyclohexane ring with a propane chain attached. Wait, no, ethynylcyclohexane is R-C≡CH. After adding methyl (step 1), it's R-C≡C-CH3. Then hydrogenation would make R-CH2-CH2-CH3. So the cyclohexane would now have a propyl group attached.

Wait, but that doesn't seem helpful for forming a carbonyl group or a hydroxyl group. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the first step is for a different purpose. Let me think about the overall synthesis.

The target has a CHO group, so perhaps it comes from oxidizing an alcohol. For oxidation to form CHO, the alcohol would have to be a secondary alcohol. So perhaps in the synthesis, we form a secondary alcohol that is then oxidized.

But how do we get that secondary alcohol?

Wait, another angle: ethynylcyclohexane can be functionalized. Maybe via hydration of the triple bond to form a ketone. But in that case, adding H2O across the triple bond would give a ketone. Wait, but with what conditions? For hydration of alkynes, you typically use HgSO4 and H2SO4 as catalysts, but that leads to the formation of a ketone. So for example, ethynylcyclohexane would become cyclohexylacetone or something similar.

Wait, but then oxidation might not be needed. Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group.

Wait, but the target has a formyl group, not a ketone. So maybe the triple bond is used to create a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is hydrogenated to a cis double bond, then ozonolysis is done to cleave it and form carbonyl groups.

Wait, but the options involve O3 in some steps.

Let me think about each possible option.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride: So same idea, but adding ethyl group.

2. Li in liquid NH3: That's for Birch reduction or for deprotonating something to form a lithium reagent. Wait, Li in NH3 is used for the formation of Grignard-like reagents, or for alkyne reductions. Alternatively, maybe for elimination.

3. O3/H2O: Ozonolysis of an alkene would break it into carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH: Workup after ozonolysis.

But I'm not sure how that would fit.

Option D:

1. NaNH2 and methanol: Hmm, methanol is a methylating agent. So NaNH2 could deprotonate, then methyl group from methanol would be added. That would give an alkyne with a methyl group.

2. Li/liq NH3: Maybe an elimination step, forming a triple bond again or a double bond.

3. O3/(CH3)2S: Ozonolysis, with a reductive workup to form aldehydes or ketones.

4. NH4OH: Workup.

Alternatively, maybe the third step is to cleave a double bond into aldehyde groups.

Hmm, perhaps the overall process involves:

- Starting with ethynylcyclohexane.

- Step 1: Deprotonate the alkyne to form a cyclohexenide, then alkylate to form a longer alkyne.

- Step 2: Hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane.

Wait, but if the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkane, that would just give a single bond, which might not form the necessary functional groups. Alternatively, if the alkyne is partially hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyls.

Wait, but the target has a formyl group. Maybe ozonolysis is used to form an aldehyde.

Wait, another approach: the target has a formyl group (CHO) and a hydroxyl group attached to a cyclohexyl. So perhaps the synthesis involves:

1. Adding a functional group to the alkyne.

2. Converting the alkyne into an alkene, then oxidizing it.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each step of each option.

Option C:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride. So ethynylcyclohexane becomes propargylcyclohexane (R-C≡C-CH3).

Step 2: H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. Hydrogenation of the triple bond to single bond: R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

So now the molecule is a cyclohexane ring with a propane chain attached.

Step 3: O3/(CH3)2S. Ozonolysis of double bonds? But wait, after hydrogenation, there are no double bonds. So this doesn't make sense. Unless step 2 didn't hydrogenate all the way, leaving a double bond.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is hydrogenation of a different functional group.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the steps wrong. Let me think again: after step 1, we have R-C≡C-CH3. Step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. That's hydrogenation of the triple bond to single bond. So R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Now, step 3 is ozonolysis, but without any double bonds, how would that work? Oh wait, maybe I'm missing a dehydrohalogenation or elimination step earlier.

Hmm, perhaps I'm on the wrong track.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. So, same as before, but using methanol as the methylating agent. So the alkyne gets a methyl group, becoming R-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: Li in liquid NH3. That's a strong base, maybe for elimination. So the R-CH2-CH2-CH3 after step 1 (if step 2 is hydrogenation) would now undergo elimination. Wait, but step 2 in option D is Li/liq NH3, which is a deprotonation agent. Maybe it's used for deprotonating a compound to form a strong base, leading to elimination.

Wait, if after step 1 we have R-C≡C-CH3, step 2 could be elimination to form a triple bond again, but that seems redundant. Alternatively, perhaps step 1 is for introducing a methyl group, and step 2 is for forming a lithium reagent.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a Birch reduction, but I'm not certain.

I think I'm getting stuck because I'm not entirely clear on each step's purpose. Let me try a different approach: thinking about the target's structure and what reactions are needed to get there.

The target has a formyl group, which likely comes from the oxidation of a secondary alcohol. So perhaps we form a secondary alcohol via some method, then oxidize it to the aldehyde.

Additionally, the substituent with the cyclohexyl and hydroxyl suggests a substitution where an -OH and a cyclohexyl group are attached to a CH2 group, which is connected to the main ring.

But how do we introduce that substituent?

Perhaps via a Grignard reagent. For example, adding a cyclohexyl Grignard to a carbonyl group.

Wait, but the starting material is an alkyne. Maybe we can convert the alkyne into a ketone, then perform some addition.

Alternatively, perhaps through a series of steps involving addition to the triple bond.

Wait, another thought: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2 group to a hydroxyl and another CH2 group attached to the main ring.

Wait, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a new ring. Alternatively, maybe the substituent comes from a cyclohexyl group attached via a Grignard addition.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a substitution reaction, like using a cyanide or another nucleophile.

Wait, perhaps the target is formed by first adding a hydroxyl group and then a cyclohexyl group.

But I'm not making much progress. Let me think about each option's reagents and see which sequence makes sense.

Option A:
1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkylation of the alkyne, making R-C≡C-CH3.
2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate to R-CH2-CH2-CH3.
3. Ba(OH)2 → maybe elimination to form a double bond.
4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → oxidation, perhaps of an alcohol to a ketone or carboxylic acid.

But how do we get an alcohol in step 3? Ba(OH)2 is sometimes used in elimination reactions, like in the formation of epoxides from alkenes, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 could be for epoxidation, but that would require a double bond. So perhaps step 2 doesn't hydrogenate the triple bond entirely, leaving a double bond. Wait, no, H2 and Pd would likely hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look for which option uses ozonolysis. Because the target has a formyl group, which might come from ozonolysis of a double bond.

Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So if there's a double bond in the molecule, ozonolysis can form the aldehyde.

So which option includes ozonolysis? Options B, C, D.

Option B: O3/H2O as step 3.

Option C: O3/(CH3)2S as step 3.

Option D: O3/(CH3)2S as step 3.

So perhaps the correct option involves ozonolysis.

Now, after ozonolysis, the workup would determine the products. Using (CH3)2S is a reductive workup, which typically prevents overoxidation. So an ozonide would break into aldehydes or ketones, depending on the substituents.

So, for the target to have a formyl group, maybe the molecule before ozonolysis has a terminal double bond. Ozonolysis would cleave it into a formyl group.

But how does that fit into the synthesis?

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → alkyne with a longer chain via alkylation.

2. Hydrogenation to form an alkane.

3. Then some reaction to form a double bond.

But I'm not quite getting it.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a cis or trans double bond, then subjected to ozonolysis.

Wait, another thought: if we have a cyclohexane ring with a propyl group (from alkylation and hydrogenation), then we could introduce a double bond via elimination, perhaps using a strong base like NaNH2 or Li/NH3.

Then, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

But how would that lead to the target structure?

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is first converted into a ketone via hydration, then further functionalized.

Wait, but the options don't include hydration steps except for maybe option A's last step, which is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. That's Jones oxidation, which oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids and secondary alcohols to ketones.

Wait, perhaps the sequence is:

1. Alkyne → alkene via some method.

2. Ozonolysis of the alkene to form carbonyl groups.

3. Oxidation or other reactions to form the target.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C:

1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride → alkyne becomes propargyl.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenate triple bond to single bond, making a longer alkane.

3. Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S → cleaves any double bonds. Wait, but after hydrogenation, there are no double bonds. So that doesn't make sense unless step 2 didn't hydrogenate completely. Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is for reducing any functional groups but not the triple bond.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Let me think about the possible steps:

Option C:

Step 1: alkyne becomes R-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd reduces the triple bond to single bond: R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But then, step 3 is ozonolysis. But no double bond exists. So perhaps step 2 is not hydrogenating the triple bond.

Wait, perhaps step 2 is hydrogenation of a different part. Or maybe step 2 is a different reaction.

Alternatively, maybe step 2 is hydrogenation of a triple bond to a trans double bond. Then, step 3 would be ozonolysis to form two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but I thought H2 and Pd would fully hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond. To get a double bond, you need a different catalyst, like Lindlar's, which hydrogenates the triple bond to a cis double bond.

Hmm, but the options don't specify the catalyst. So perhaps step 2 in option C is hydrogenation to a double bond, not a single bond.

Wait, no, because the catalyst is Pd, which typically would hydrogenate all the way to single bond. Unless it's a different condition.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is using a poisoned catalyst that stops at the alkene.

But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, so let's think through that.

After step 1: propargylcyclohexane (R-C≡C-CH3).

Step 2: H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenate triple bond to single bond: R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Step 3: Ozonolysis. But without a double bond, how does ozonolysis happen? Unless I'm missing something. Maybe step 2 isn't hydrogenation of the alkyne. Wait, maybe step 2 is dehydrohalogenation or another reaction. No, step 2 is H2/Pd.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is hydrogenation of the alkyne to a cis double bond. But again, with Pd as catalyst, I thought it hydrogenated fully.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is hydrogenation of a different part of the molecule, but I'm not sure.

I think I'm stuck. Let me try another approach: looking for the correct number of steps.

The target has two new functional groups: a formyl group and a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group. So probably, the synthesis requires introducing these groups through multiple steps.

Option C has four steps, as do the others. Let's think about each step:

Option C:

1. Alkylation of the alkyne to make propargylcyclohexane.

2. Hydrogenation of the alkyne to propane chain.

3. Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S. But without a double bond, this can't happen. Hmm.

Wait, maybe after hydrogenation, there's a different reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation step isn't for the alkyne.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the target again.

The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main ring is cyclohexane with a formyl group. And at position 1, there's a substituent which is a (cyclohexyl) (hydroxy) methyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH(OH) group attached to a cyclohexyl and the main ring.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group with an OH and a cyclohexyl group, attached to the main ring. So the main ring has two substituents: CHO and CH2(OH)(cyclohexyl).

But how to form that.

Another approach: think about the possible reagents and what they would produce.

Looking at option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol → alkynide, then methyl group added, making R-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: Li/liq NH3 → perhaps forming a lithium reagent, then elimination to form a double bond.

Wait, Li in NH3 is used for deprotonation to form strong bases. For example, in the Birch reduction, or for deprotonating alcohols to form alkoxide bases.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is for forming a Grignard-like reagent.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

But I'm not making progress. I think I need to look for which option correctly forms the necessary groups.

Wait, another angle: the target has a formyl group, which is an aldehyde. Aldehydes can be formed via oxidation of primary alcohols or via ozonolysis of terminal alkenes.

So, perhaps the aldehyde comes from ozonolysis. Thus, before ozonolysis, there must be a double bond, preferably a terminal one.

Which option includes ozonolysis with a reagent that would prevent overoxidation, like (CH3)2S?

Options C and D use that.

So, in the correct option, after forming a double bond, ozonolysis would cleave it into an aldehyde.

So let's see how that fits.

For example, if after step 2 of option C, the molecule has a double bond, then ozonolysis would form the aldehyde.

But step 2 in option C is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate, which would hydrogenate the triple bond to single bond. So unless there's another double bond formed before ozonolysis.

Alternatively, maybe step 2 in option C is for hydrogenation of a different part, and the triple bond is converted into a double bond via another method.

Wait, perhaps I should reconsider step 2. Let me think: if the alkyne is first alkylated to propargyl, then step 2 could be hydrogenation, but with a different catalyst that stops at the double bond. So, if step 2 uses H2 with a poisoned catalyst like Lindlar's, it would hydrogenate the alkyne to a cis-alkene. Then, ozonolysis of the cis-alkene would form two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but the options don't specify the catalyst. So, in option C, step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. Pd usually hydrogenates triple bonds to single bonds. Unless the conditions are different.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is hydrogenation of a double bond, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is not hydrogenation but something else.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C.

But I'm not confident. Given the time I've spent, I think I should go with option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The target molecule, 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, consists of a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (-CHO) and a substituent at position 1, which is a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group. The synthesis begins with ethynylcyclohexane, a cyclohexane ring with a terminal alkyne (-C≡CH). The analysis of the options involves determining the sequence of reagents that can transform the starting material into the target molecule.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**:
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and methyl chloride likely alkylate the terminal alkyne, forming a longer alkyne (R-C≡C-CH₃).
   - Step 2: H₂/Pd reduces the alkyne to a single bond (R-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃).
   - Step 3: Ba(OH)₂ could induce elimination to form a double bond.
   - Step 4: H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O would oxidize an alcohol to a carboxylic acid or ketone.
   - However, this sequence does not clearly explain the formation of the formyl group or the hydroxylated cyclohexyl substituent.

2. **Option B**:
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and ethyl chloride alkylate the alkyne, forming a longer alkyne (R-C≡C-CH₂CH₃).
   - Step 2: Li/liq. NH₃ could deprotonate or eliminate to form a double bond.
   - Step 3: O₃/H₂O performs ozonolysis, cleaving a double bond into carbonyl groups.
   - Step 4: NH₄OH likely neutralizes acidic byproducts.
   - While ozonolysis could form a carbonyl group, this sequence does not clearly account for the hydroxylated cyclohexyl substituent.

3. **Option C**:
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and methyl chloride alkylate the alkyne, forming a longer alkyne (R-C≡C-CH₃).
   - Step 2: H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate reduces the alkyne to a single bond (R-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃).
   - Step 3: O₃/(CH₃)₂S performs ozonolysis, but this step is unclear since no double bond is present after step 2.
   - Step 4: Ba(OH)₂ could induce elimination or other transformations.
   - This sequence is ambiguous, particularly regarding the role of ozonolysis.

4. **Option D**:
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and methanol alkylate the alkyne, forming a longer alkyne (R-C≡C-CH₃).
   - Step 2: Li/liq. NH₃ could eliminate to form a double bond.
   - Step 3: O₃/(CH₃)₂S performs ozonolysis, cleaving the double bond into carbonyl groups.
   - Step 4: NH₄OH neutralizes acidic byproducts.
   - This sequence is plausible for forming the formyl group via ozonolysis, but it does not clearly explain the formation of the hydroxylated cyclohexyl substituent.

### Conclusion:
The target molecule requires the formation of a formyl group and a hydroxylated cyclohexyl substituent. While ozonolysis (as in options C and D) could contribute to forming the formyl group, none of the options fully clarify the formation of the hydroxylated cyclohexyl substituent. Based on the analysis, **Option C** appears to be the most consistent with the required transformations, despite some ambiguities.

Answer: C

Alright, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis problems can be tricky. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize its structure. So, I think it's a cyclohexane ring with two substituents: one is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH)CH2- group, and the other is a formyl (CHO) group. Or wait, maybe the numbering is different. Let me think again. The name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde part is a cyclohexane ring with a -CHO group. Then, at position 1, there's a substituent: cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. So that substituent is a CH2 group attached to a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group. So the structure would have two cyclohexane rings connected. One is the main ring with the aldehyde, and the substituent is another cyclohexyl attached via a CH2-OH-CH2 group, or wait, maybe it's CH2(OH)CH2-cyclohexyl? Wait, the substituent is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl), which would be a CH2 group with a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl. So the substituent is cyclohexyl-CH(OH)-CH2- attached to the main cyclohexane ring?

Wait, maybe I should draw it out. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group where one of the hydrogens is replaced by a hydroxyl group and another by a cyclohexyl group. So like, it's a CH2 group attached to the main ring, and that CH2 has a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group attached. So the substituent is -CH(OH)-cyclohexyl? Or perhaps it's -CH2- where one H is OH and another is cyclohexyl. Oh wait, no, the substituent is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl), which is a methyl group (CH3) where one H is replaced by cyclohexyl and another by OH. So the structure would be -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl). So the main ring has a substituent at position 1 which is a CH(OH)CH2 group? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group attached to both a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group. So it's CH2(OH)(cyclohexyl). Wait, that doesn't make sense because CH2 can't have three substituents. Oh, wait, no, the substituent is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl), which would be a methyl group attached to a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl. So the substituent is CH2(OH) attached to a cyclohexyl. Wait, no, that can't be right either. Oh, perhaps it's a secondary carbon. Like, the substituent is a CH group attached to the main ring, and that CH has an OH and a cyclohexyl group. So it's -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl), making it a branching point.

So the target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a CHO group at position 1 (or wherever 1 is), and another substituent at position 1 which is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group. Wait, maybe the main ring is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, so that's a cyclohexane ring with a -CHO group. Then, at position 1 (or in the same carbon?), there's a substituent which is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. Wait, maybe the substituent is a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group attached to the same carbon as the aldehyde. So the aldehyde is on carbon 1, and that same carbon has a substituent which is a CH2 group connected to a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is like this: cyclohexanecarbaldehyde means a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO) attached. Then, at the same carbon (carbon 1), there's another substituent: a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2 group, which also has a hydroxyl group. So the structure would be, on carbon 1, a carbonyl group (CHO) and a CH2 group attached to both a hydroxyl (OH) and a cyclohexyl group. So the carbon would have three substituents: CHO, CH2-OH, and CH2-cyclohexyl? No, that can't be. Wait, the carbon can have four bonds. So maybe the structure is cyclohexane with a -CH(OH)-cyclohexyl group attached, and a -CHO group as well. So, the same carbon has both the aldehyde and the CH(OH)cyclohexyl group.

Wait, perhaps the target molecule is something like cyclohexane with two substituents on the same carbon: one is a formyl group (CHO), and the other is a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2 group that has a hydroxyl group. So the substituent is a CH2 group with an OH and a cyclohexyl. So it's a CH2(OH)(cyclohexyl) group attached to the same carbon as the aldehyde.

But I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure. Maybe I should focus on the starting material and the possible reagents to figure out the steps.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So that's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (a triple bond) attached. So it's cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group.

The target molecule seems to have a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group. So perhaps the aldehyde comes from some oxidation. Also, the substituent with the hydroxyl and cyclohexyl groups probably comes from some kind of addition or coupling reaction.

So the steps to get from ethynylcyclohexane to the target involve several reactions. Let's think about each step.

Looking at the options, the reagents vary between NaNH2, H2/Pd, Ba(OH)2, H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O, Li/liq NH3, O3, (CH3)2S, NH4OH, etc.

Option A: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; then H2/Pd; then Ba(OH)2; then H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

Option B: Steps are NaNH2, ethyl chloride; then Li/liq NH3; then O3/H2O; then NH4OH.

Option C: NaNH2, methyl chloride; H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; O3/(CH3)2S; Ba(OH)2.

Option D: NaNH2, methanol; Li/liq NH3; O3/(CH3)2S; NH4OH.

Hmm.

Let me think about each possible reagent's role.

1. NaNH2 is a strong base, often used for deprotonation. Maybe for elimination or for forming alkynes or alkenes.

2. H2 with a catalyst like Pd is hydrogenation, typically used to reduce triple bonds or double bonds. So ethynylcyclohexane (which is an alkyne) could be hydrogenated to an alkane, but that's probably not correct. Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is a substituted ethyne. So if you hydrogenate it with H2 and Pd, it would reduce to ethylcyclohexane. But perhaps using a Lindlar catalyst would hydrogenate the triple bond to a cis double bond, but the options don't specify that.

3. Ba(OH)2 is used for elimination reactions, perhaps for forming rings. Or maybe for epoxide openings, but more likely, it's used in the Birch reduction or for elimination (like in the formation of alkenes via dehydrohalogenation).

4. O3 is ozone, which is used in ozonolysis to cleave double bonds into carbonyl groups. And then (CH3)2S is a reductive workup, perhaps to prevent overoxidation.

5. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O might be for oxidation, like in the Jones oxidation, which converts alcohols to ketones or carboxylic acids, depending on the conditions.

6. NH4OH is ammonium hydroxide, maybe for workup after ozonolysis or as a base in some reactions.

So the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Let's think about what reactions could be applied.

First step in the options is NaNH2 and methyl chloride. Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. Methyl chloride (CH3Cl) is a methylating agent. So perhaps the first step is deprotonation followed by alkylation. But ethynylcyclohexane has acidic protons where? The alkyne proton is acidic. So NaNH2 would deprotonate the ethynyl group, making a cyclohexenyl lithium or something similar. Then methyl chloride would methylate it? Or perhaps it's an alkylation of the alkyne.

Wait, another possibility: the alkyne could be converted into a more reactive form. NaNH2 is a strong base, so it could deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane. The alkyne has two protons, but which one is more acidic? The terminal alkyne protons are more acidic than internal, so in ethynylcyclohexane, the triple bond is at the end, so the protons are terminal. So NaNH2 would deprotonate to form a cyclohexenyl anion, maybe. Then, when methyl chloride is added, it would alkylate the anion, adding a methyl group. So the alkyne would become a longer alkyne? No, wait, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane-C≡CH. Deprotonating would give cyclohexane-C≡C- minus, then adding CH3+ (from CH3Cl) would give cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3. So that's propargylcyclohexane or something? Wait, maybe it's forming a longer alkyne.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the first step is using NaNH2 and methyl chloride for a Grignard-like reaction, but I'm not exactly sure. Let's think: NaNH2 is used with alkyl halides to form alkynides. So, if you have ethynylcyclohexane, treating with NaNH2 might deprotonate the alkyne to form a cyclohexenyl lithium or something, but wait, ethynylcyclohexane is R-C≡CH. Deprotonating gives R-C≡C^−, which would then react with an electrophile, like methyl chloride (CH3Cl), to form R-C≡C-CH3. So the product after step 1 would be a longer alkyne: R-C≡C-CH3.

Wait, but wait. Ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexyl-ethylC≡CH? No, ethynyl is -C≡CH, so ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group. So after deprotonation, adding methyl chloride would add a methyl group to the alkyne, making it a longer alkyne. So, R-C≡C-CH3, which is 1-propynylcyclohexane? Hmm. Then, step 2 in option A is H2/Pd. So that would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond. So the alkyne becomes an alkane. So ethynylcyclohexane becomes ethylcyclohexane, but with some substitution.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting off track. Let me think about the target molecule again. It has a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group and another substituent with a cyclohexyl and hydroxyl. So perhaps the formyl group comes from oxidation of a secondary alcohol, and the substituent with cyclohexyl and hydroxyl comes from some addition.

Wait, another approach: the target's substituent is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl, which suggests a substitution where a methyl group has both a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group attached. That might come from a Grignard addition or some kind of coupling reaction.

Let me think about each option's steps.

Option C's steps are:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: as before, would add a methyl group to the alkyne, turning ethynylcyclohexane into propargylcyclohexane (maybe not exactly, but longer alkyne).

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate: hydrogenation of the triple bond to single bond. So propargyl becomes propane.

So the molecule would now be a cyclohexane ring with a propane chain attached. Wait, no, ethynylcyclohexane is R-C≡CH. After adding methyl (step 1), it's R-C≡C-CH3. Then hydrogenation would make R-CH2-CH2-CH3. So the cyclohexane would now have a propyl group attached.

Wait, but that doesn't seem helpful for forming a carbonyl group or a hydroxyl group. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the first step is for a different purpose. Let me think about the overall synthesis.

The target has a CHO group, so perhaps it comes from oxidizing an alcohol. For oxidation to form CHO, the alcohol would have to be a secondary alcohol. So perhaps in the synthesis, we form a secondary alcohol that is then oxidized.

But how do we get that secondary alcohol?

Wait, another angle: ethynylcyclohexane can be functionalized. Maybe via hydration of the triple bond to form a ketone. But in that case, adding H2O across the triple bond would give a ketone. Wait, but with what conditions? For hydration of alkynes, you typically use HgSO4 and H2SO4 as catalysts, but that leads to the formation of a ketone. So for example, ethynylcyclohexane would become cyclohexylacetone or something similar.

Wait, but then oxidation might not be needed. Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group.

Wait, but the target has a formyl group, not a ketone. So maybe the triple bond is used to create a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is hydrogenated to a cis double bond, then ozonolysis is done to cleave it and form carbonyl groups.

Wait, but the options involve O3 in some steps.

Let me think about each possible option.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride: So same idea, but adding ethyl group.

2. Li in liquid NH3: That's for Birch reduction or for deprotonating something to form a lithium reagent. Wait, Li in NH3 is used for the formation of Grignard-like reagents, or for alkyne reductions. Alternatively, maybe for elimination.

3. O3/H2O: Ozonolysis of an alkene would break it into carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH: Workup after ozonolysis.

But I'm not sure how that would fit.

Option D:

1. NaNH2 and methanol: Hmm, methanol is a methylating agent. So NaNH2 could deprotonate, then methyl group from methanol would be added. That would give an alkyne with a methyl group.

2. Li/liq NH3: Maybe an elimination step, forming a triple bond again or a double bond.

3. O3/(CH3)2S: Ozonolysis, with a reductive workup to form aldehydes or ketones.

4. NH4OH: Workup.

Alternatively, maybe the third step is to cleave a double bond into aldehyde groups.

Hmm, perhaps the overall process involves:

- Starting with ethynylcyclohexane.

- Step 1: Deprotonate the alkyne to form a cyclohexenide, then alkylate to form a longer alkyne.

- Step 2: Hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane.

Wait, but if the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkane, that would just give a single bond, which might not form the necessary functional groups. Alternatively, if the alkyne is partially hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyls.

Wait, but the target has a formyl group. Maybe ozonolysis is used to form an aldehyde.

Wait, another approach: the target has a formyl group (CHO) and a hydroxyl group attached to a cyclohexyl. So perhaps the synthesis involves:

1. Adding a functional group to the alkyne.

2. Converting the alkyne into an alkene, then oxidizing it.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each step of each option.

Option C:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride. So ethynylcyclohexane becomes propargylcyclohexane (R-C≡C-CH3).

Step 2: H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. Hydrogenation of the triple bond to single bond: R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

So now the molecule is a cyclohexane ring with a propane chain attached.

Step 3: O3/(CH3)2S. Ozonolysis of double bonds? But wait, after hydrogenation, there are no double bonds. So this doesn't make sense. Unless step 2 didn't hydrogenate all the way, leaving a double bond.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is hydrogenation of a different functional group.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the steps wrong. Let me think again: after step 1, we have R-C≡C-CH3. Step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. That's hydrogenation of the triple bond to single bond. So R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Now, step 3 is ozonolysis, but without any double bonds, how would that work? Oh wait, maybe I'm missing a dehydrohalogenation or elimination step earlier.

Hmm, perhaps I'm on the wrong track.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. So, same as before, but using methanol as the methylating agent. So the alkyne gets a methyl group, becoming R-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: Li in liquid NH3. That's a strong base, maybe for elimination. So the R-CH2-CH2-CH3 after step 1 (if step 2 is hydrogenation) would now undergo elimination. Wait, but step 2 in option D is Li/liq NH3, which is a deprotonation agent. Maybe it's used for deprotonating a compound to form a strong base, leading to elimination.

Wait, if after step 1 we have R-C≡C-CH3, step 2 could be elimination to form a triple bond again, but that seems redundant. Alternatively, perhaps step 1 is for introducing a methyl group, and step 2 is for forming a lithium reagent.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a Birch reduction, but I'm not certain.

I think I'm getting stuck because I'm not entirely clear on each step's purpose. Let me try a different approach: thinking about the target's structure and what reactions are needed to get there.

The target has a formyl group, which likely comes from the oxidation of a secondary alcohol. So perhaps we form a secondary alcohol via some method, then oxidize it to the aldehyde.

Additionally, the substituent with the cyclohexyl and hydroxyl suggests a substitution where an -OH and a cyclohexyl group are attached to a CH2 group, which is connected to the main ring.

But how do we introduce that substituent?

Perhaps via a Grignard reagent. For example, adding a cyclohexyl Grignard to a carbonyl group.

Wait, but the starting material is an alkyne. Maybe we can convert the alkyne into a ketone, then perform some addition.

Alternatively, perhaps through a series of steps involving addition to the triple bond.

Wait, another thought: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2 group to a hydroxyl and another CH2 group attached to the main ring.

Wait, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a new ring. Alternatively, maybe the substituent comes from a cyclohexyl group attached via a Grignard addition.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a substitution reaction, like using a cyanide or another nucleophile.

Wait, perhaps the target is formed by first adding a hydroxyl group and then a cyclohexyl group.

But I'm not making much progress. Let me think about each option's reagents and see which sequence makes sense.

Option A:
1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkylation of the alkyne, making R-C≡C-CH3.
2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate to R-CH2-CH2-CH3.
3. Ba(OH)2 → maybe elimination to form a double bond.
4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → oxidation, perhaps of an alcohol to a ketone or carboxylic acid.

But how do we get an alcohol in step 3? Ba(OH)2 is sometimes used in elimination reactions, like in the formation of epoxides from alkenes, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 could be for epoxidation, but that would require a double bond. So perhaps step 2 doesn't hydrogenate the triple bond entirely, leaving a double bond. Wait, no, H2 and Pd would likely hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look for which option uses ozonolysis. Because the target has a formyl group, which might come from ozonolysis of a double bond.

Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So if there's a double bond in the molecule, ozonolysis can form the aldehyde.

So which option includes ozonolysis? Options B, C, D.

Option B: O3/H2O as step 3.

Option C: O3/(CH3)2S as step 3.

Option D: O3/(CH3)2S as step 3.

So perhaps the correct option involves ozonolysis.

Now, after ozonolysis, the workup would determine the products. Using (CH3)2S is a reductive workup, which typically prevents overoxidation. So an ozonide would break into aldehydes or ketones, depending on the substituents.

So, for the target to have a formyl group, maybe the molecule before ozonolysis has a terminal double bond. Ozonolysis would cleave it into a formyl group.

But how does that fit into the synthesis?

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → alkyne with a longer chain via alkylation.

2. Hydrogenation to form an alkane.

3. Then some reaction to form a double bond.

But I'm not quite getting it.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a cis or trans double bond, then subjected to ozonolysis.

Wait, another thought: if we have a cyclohexane ring with a propyl group (from alkylation and hydrogenation), then we could introduce a double bond via elimination, perhaps using a strong base like NaNH2 or Li/NH3.

Then, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

But how would that lead to the target structure?

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is first converted into a ketone via hydration, then further functionalized.

Wait, but the options don't include hydration steps except for maybe option A's last step, which is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. That's Jones oxidation, which oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids and secondary alcohols to ketones.

Wait, perhaps the sequence is:

1. Alkyne → alkene via some method.

2. Ozonolysis of the alkene to form carbonyl groups.

3. Oxidation or other reactions to form the target.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C:

1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride → alkyne becomes propargyl.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenate triple bond to single bond, making a longer alkane.

3. Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S → cleaves any double bonds. Wait, but after hydrogenation, there are no double bonds. So that doesn't make sense unless step 2 didn't hydrogenate completely. Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is for reducing any functional groups but not the triple bond.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Let me think about the possible steps:

Option C:

Step 1: alkyne becomes R-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd reduces the triple bond to single bond: R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But then, step 3 is ozonolysis. But no double bond exists. So perhaps step 2 is not hydrogenating the triple bond.

Wait, perhaps step 2 is hydrogenation of a different part. Or maybe step 2 is a different reaction.

Alternatively, maybe step 2 is hydrogenation of a triple bond to a trans double bond. Then, step 3 would be ozonolysis to form two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but I thought H2 and Pd would fully hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond. To get a double bond, you need a different catalyst, like Lindlar's, which hydrogenates the triple bond to a cis double bond.

Hmm, but the options don't specify the catalyst. So perhaps step 2 in option C is hydrogenation to a double bond, not a single bond.

Wait, no, because the catalyst is Pd, which typically would hydrogenate all the way to single bond. Unless it's a different condition.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is using a poisoned catalyst that stops at the alkene.

But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, so let's think through that.

After step 1: propargylcyclohexane (R-C≡C-CH3).

Step 2: H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenate triple bond to single bond: R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Step 3: Ozonolysis. But without a double bond, how does ozonolysis happen? Unless I'm missing something. Maybe step 2 isn't hydrogenation of the alkyne. Wait, maybe step 2 is dehydrohalogenation or another reaction. No, step 2 is H2/Pd.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is hydrogenation of the alkyne to a cis double bond. But again, with Pd as catalyst, I thought it hydrogenated fully.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is hydrogenation of a different part of the molecule, but I'm not sure.

I think I'm stuck. Let me try another approach: looking for the correct number of steps.

The target has two new functional groups: a formyl group and a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group. So probably, the synthesis requires introducing these groups through multiple steps.

Option C has four steps, as do the others. Let's think about each step:

Option C:

1. Alkylation of the alkyne to make propargylcyclohexane.

2. Hydrogenation of the alkyne to propane chain.

3. Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S. But without a double bond, this can't happen. Hmm.

Wait, maybe after hydrogenation, there's a different reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation step isn't for the alkyne.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the target again.

The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main ring is cyclohexane with a formyl group. And at position 1, there's a substituent which is a (cyclohexyl) (hydroxy) methyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH(OH) group attached to a cyclohexyl and the main ring.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group with an OH and a cyclohexyl group, attached to the main ring. So the main ring has two substituents: CHO and CH2(OH)(cyclohexyl).

But how to form that.

Another approach: think about the possible reagents and what they would produce.

Looking at option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol → alkynide, then methyl group added, making R-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: Li/liq NH3 → perhaps forming a lithium reagent, then elimination to form a double bond.

Wait, Li in NH3 is used for deprotonation to form strong bases. For example, in the Birch reduction, or for deprotonating alcohols to form alkoxide bases.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is for forming a Grignard-like reagent.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

But I'm not making progress. I think I need to look for which option correctly forms the necessary groups.

Wait, another angle: the target has a formyl group, which is an aldehyde. Aldehydes can be formed via oxidation of primary alcohols or via ozonolysis of terminal alkenes.

So, perhaps the aldehyde comes from ozonolysis. Thus, before ozonolysis, there must be a double bond, preferably a terminal one.

Which option includes ozonolysis with a reagent that would prevent overoxidation, like (CH3)2S?

Options C and D use that.

So, in the correct option, after forming a double bond, ozonolysis would cleave it into an aldehyde.

So let's see how that fits.

For example, if after step 2 of option C, the molecule has a double bond, then ozonolysis would form the aldehyde.

But step 2 in option C is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate, which would hydrogenate the triple bond to single bond. So unless there's another double bond formed before ozonolysis.

Alternatively, maybe step 2 in option C is for hydrogenation of a different part, and the triple bond is converted into a double bond via another method.

Wait, perhaps I should reconsider step 2. Let me think: if the alkyne is first alkylated to propargyl, then step 2 could be hydrogenation, but with a different catalyst that stops at the double bond. So, if step 2 uses H2 with a poisoned catalyst like Lindlar's, it would hydrogenate the alkyne to a cis-alkene. Then, ozonolysis of the cis-alkene would form two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but the options don't specify the catalyst. So, in option C, step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. Pd usually hydrogenates triple bonds to single bonds. Unless the conditions are different.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is hydrogenation of a double bond, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is not hydrogenation but something else.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C.

But I'm not confident. Given the time I've spent, I think I should go with option C.


The target molecule, 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, consists of a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (-CHO) and a substituent at position 1, which is a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group. The synthesis begins with ethynylcyclohexane, a cyclohexane ring with a terminal alkyne (-C≡CH). The analysis of the options involves determining the sequence of reagents that can transform the starting material into the target molecule.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**:
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and methyl chloride likely alkylate the terminal alkyne, forming a longer alkyne (R-C≡C-CH₃).
   - Step 2: H₂/Pd reduces the alkyne to a single bond (R-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃).
   - Step 3: Ba(OH)₂ could induce elimination to form a double bond.
   - Step 4: H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O would oxidize an alcohol to a carboxylic acid or ketone.
   - However, this sequence does not clearly explain the formation of the formyl group or the hydroxylated cyclohexyl substituent.

2. **Option B**:
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and ethyl chloride alkylate the alkyne, forming a longer alkyne (R-C≡C-CH₂CH₃).
   - Step 2: Li/liq. NH₃ could deprotonate or eliminate to form a double bond.
   - Step 3: O₃/H₂O performs ozonolysis, cleaving a double bond into carbonyl groups.
   - Step 4: NH₄OH likely neutralizes acidic byproducts.
   - While ozonolysis could form a carbonyl group, this sequence does not clearly account for the hydroxylated cyclohexyl substituent.

3. **Option C**:
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and methyl chloride alkylate the alkyne, forming a longer alkyne (R-C≡C-CH₃).
   - Step 2: H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate reduces the alkyne to a single bond (R-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃).
   - Step 3: O₃/(CH₃)₂S performs ozonolysis, but this step is unclear since no double bond is present after step 2.
   - Step 4: Ba(OH)₂ could induce elimination or other transformations.
   - This sequence is ambiguous, particularly regarding the role of ozonolysis.

4. **Option D**:
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and methanol alkylate the alkyne, forming a longer alkyne (R-C≡C-CH₃).
   - Step 2: Li/liq. NH₃ could eliminate to form a double bond.
   - Step 3: O₃/(CH₃)₂S performs ozonolysis, cleaving the double bond into carbonyl groups.
   - Step 4: NH₄OH neutralizes acidic byproducts.
   - This sequence is plausible for forming the formyl group via ozonolysis, but it does not clearly explain the formation of the hydroxylated cyclohexyl substituent.

### Conclusion:
The target molecule requires the formation of a formyl group and a hydroxylated cyclohexyl substituent. While ozonolysis (as in options C and D) could contribute to forming the formyl group, none of the options fully clarify the formation of the hydroxylated cyclohexyl substituent. Based on the analysis, **Option C** appears to be the most consistent with the required transformations, despite some ambiguities.

Answer: C
