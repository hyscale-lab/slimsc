Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading through the question carefully.

So, the question is about a reaction involving Substance X, liquid Y, and the products formed. There's a lot to unpack here, so I'll take it slowly.

First, the question says Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. That suggests that X is an element or perhaps a compound where one of the atoms is a heavier isotope. For example, maybe it's a diatomic molecule where one atom is the heavier isotope, like oxygen-18 in water.

Then, X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Hmm, same number of N and P—so each molecule of W has, say, 2 H and 2 O? Wait, no. Let me think: if the molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons, that could mean the molecule is something like H2O, but wait, H2O has 2 H (each with 1 proton and 0 neutrons) and one O (8 protons, 8 neutrons). So total protons: 2 + 8 =10. Neutrons: 8. Not equal. So that's not it.

Wait, another thought: maybe W is CO2. Let's see. CO2 has one C and two O. Carbon has 6 protons and 6 neutrons (if it's 12C). Oxygen has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (16O). So each CO2 molecule has (6 + (8*2)) protons. That's 6 +16=22 protons. Neutrons would be (6 + (8*2))= 6 +16=22. Oh, wait, that makes each CO2 molecule have 22 protons and 22 neutrons. So same number. So gas W is CO2?

Alternatively, maybe it's another molecule. Let's think about other possibilities. Like CH4: each molecule has 6 protons (from C) and 4 (from H) so 10 protons. Neutrons: C is 6, H is none. So 6 neutrons. Not equal. So that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps W is a noble gas. For example, Argon. Ar has atomic number 18, so 18 protons. Its most common isotope is Ar-40, which has 18 neutrons. So a molecule of Ar is just one atom, so protons =18, neutrons=18. That fits. So W could be Ar gas.

But wait, the reaction is between X and Y, which is a liquid. What liquids react with something to produce a noble gas? Maybe when metals react with acids, but that usually produces H2 gas, not Ar. Alternatively, maybe it's a decomposition reaction.

Alternatively, maybe W is something like O2 or O3? Let's see: O2 has 16 protons each, so 32 protons in O2. Neutrons per O atom is 8, so O2 has 16 neutrons. 32 vs 16; not equal. So that's not matching.

Wait, another idea: could W be a molecule with equal protons and neutrons? Let's check for H2O again. H2O has 2 H's (protons: 2) and one O (protons: 8, neutrons: 8). So total protons: 10, neutrons: 8. Not equal. So not that.

Wait, maybe it's something like BF3? B has 5 protons, F has 9 each. So BF3: 5 + 3*9=32 protons. Neutrons: B (5, assuming it's ^7B, which is 1 neutron) and F (each ^19F has 10 neutrons). So 1 + 3*10=31. Hmm, 32 protons vs 31 neutrons. Not equal.

Alternatively, maybe W is something with a single atom, like Ar. Because then protons equal neutrons. So, Ar has 18 protons and 18 neutrons. So that's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps it's another molecule. Let me think about other possibilities. Maybe N2? Each N has 7 protons and 7 neutrons (if ^14N). So N2 would have 14 protons and 14 neutrons. So equal. So that's another possibility.

Wait, so W could be N2 or Ar or CO2. Hmm.

Next, the reaction produces a precipitate G, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. So what substance has a melting point near that? Let me think. Water's melting point is 273 K (0 C), so 277 is a bit higher—so maybe a different material.

Wait, perhaps B is something else. Alternatively, maybe B is a compound that's solid at 0 C but higher. Let me think: maybe something like B is a solid whose melting point is about 277 K. Let me think about melting points:

- Ice (H2O) melts at 273 K (0 C)
- Maybe something else, like some salts?

Wait, perhaps B is a metal. Alternatively, perhaps B is a different compound. Let's think about the reaction.

When Substance X reacts with Y, which is a liquid, and produces gas W. So perhaps X is a metal reacting with an acid, Y. The reaction produces a gas like H2. But earlier, W wasn't H2 since H2 would have 2 protons and 0 neutrons per molecule.

Wait, another angle. Let's think about the products. The precipitate G, when heated, releases B. So heating G gives B. So perhaps G is a carbonate, and when heated, it decomposes into CO2 (so W is CO2?), but that depends.

Wait, let's think about the entire reaction. X reacts with Y to produce W gas and precipitate G. G, when heated, gives B. B has a melting point close to 277 K. Let me consider what B might be.

So perhaps B is a solid at room temperature but near 0 C. Alternatively, maybe B is a metal that's solid near that temperature.

Wait, let me think about the reaction further. If Y is a liquid, perhaps it's a strong acid or a base. Suppose Y is water, but it's a liquid, which it is. So X might be a metal reacting with water, but that usually produces H2 gas. But W's molecule needs same protons and neutrons.

Wait, X is a heavier isotope. So perhaps X is an isotope-containing compound. For example, if X is H2O with a heavier O isotope, like O-18. Then, when it reacts with Y (maybe another substance), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a heavy water analog. Let's say X is D2O (deuterium oxide). Then, reacting D2O with something else.

But then Y is a liquid. Maybe Y is an acid. Let's say Y is HCl (a liquid when concentrated). So X could be a metal, perhaps. Let's think: maybe X is Mg, but that's a solid, not a liquid. Hmm.

Wait, the question says X is a substance known for incorporating a heavier isotope. So perhaps X is H2O with a heavy isotope of O, like O-18. So that would make X heavy water. Then Y could be a base, like NaOH, but that's a solid. Alternatively, Y might be another oxide.

Wait, but when heavy water (X) reacts with something, what would that produce? Maybe when it reacts with a metal, but that's not likely if Y is a liquid.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a different compound. Let me think about another scenario: Maybe X is a heavy isotope-containing compound, like D2O. When it's reacted with a liquid Y, perhaps an acid, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the product when a keto acid reacts with X. The product contains 2 atoms of oxygen. So, the product is a compound formed from X and a keto acid, and it has two oxygen atoms.

Wait, a keto acid is an organic acid with a ketone group. For example, something like acetoacetic acid. When it reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. So perhaps X is a base that deprotonates the keto acid, but that's just a thought.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a strong base like NaOH. Then, reacting with a keto acid would form a salt. The product would be something like the sodium salt of the keto acid. But the product would have oxygen in it. But the product has two oxygen atoms. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe X is a metal, and the reaction is a substitution. The product would then be a salt. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Let me go back to the precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B. So perhaps G is a carbonate, and when heated, it decomposes into CO2 and a metal oxide. So then, B would be the metal oxide. Alternatively, perhaps G is something else, like a sulfate.

Wait, but the melting point of B is close to 277 K. So 277 K is about 4°C. What solid has a melting point around there? Maybe something like water ice (but that's 0°C), or perhaps another substance.

Wait, maybe B is a solid with a higher melting point. Alternatively, perhaps B is a metal. For example, mercury has a melting point around -39°C, so that's too low. Lead melts at 327°C, which is way higher. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe B is a different compound. Wait, perhaps it's not a pure element but a compound. Let's think about something like NaOH. No, NaOH is a solid but it's not clear about the melting point.

Wait, perhaps B is a metal oxide. Let me think, perhaps it's something like MgO. But MgO has a high melting point.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about possible reactions that fit the description.

Reaction: X (substance with a heavy isotope) reacts with liquid Y to produce gas W, precipitate G.

Suppose Y is a solution of a salt. For example, Y could be a solution of Na2CO3. Then, X could be a metal. But the reaction would proceed as a double displacement, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a strong acid. If X is a carbonate, then the reaction would produce CO2 gas and a precipitate. Wait, but if X is a carbonate, then reacting with acid would produce CO2 and a salt.

Wait, let me think. If X is a carbonate (like CaCO3), and Y is HCl (a liquid?), then the reaction would be:

CaCO3 + 2 HCl → CaCl2 + CO2↑ + H2O.

In this case, W would be CO2, which matches our earlier thought that CO2 has equal protons and neutrons in the molecule. So W is CO2.

The precipitate G would be CaCl2, but wait, no, CaCl2 is soluble. Hmm, perhaps G is something else. Wait, perhaps Y is a base. Let's say Y is NaOH. Then, X is a carbonate. So, X + Y would produce CO2 and Na2CO3. Wait, but Na2CO3 is soluble, so G wouldn't precipitate. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of a different salt. Let me try another approach. Suppose X is a metal carbonate, and Y is an acid. So the reaction produces CO2, and the salt could be precipitate if it's insoluble. For example, if X is Ag2CO3 (silver carbonate), which is not very common, but let's imagine. Reacting with HCl (liquid Y), the reaction would be:

Ag2CO3 + 2 HCl → 2 AgCl↓ + CO2↑ + H2O.

In this case, W is CO2, G is AgCl. Then, when AgCl is heated, it decomposes into Ag and O2. Wait, no, AgCl doesn't decompose upon heating; it's quite stable. Alternatively, maybe it's a different carbonate.

Wait, perhaps X is a carbonate of a metal that forms an insoluble chloride. For example, suppose X is PbCO3. Reacting with HCl, you get PbCl2, which is only slightly soluble. Wait, PbCl2 is soluble in hot water, but maybe in cold water, it's less soluble. So maybe it precipitates. Then, when heated, PbCl2 decomposes into PbO and HCl gas? Hmm, but I'm not sure about the exact reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the precipitate G is something that, when heated, releases B. Let's say G is a carbonate, and upon heating, it decomposes into CO2 and a metal oxide. So, for example, if G is CaCO3, heating would produce CaO and CO2. Then, B would be CaO. The melting point of CaO is around 2600°C, which is way higher than 277 K (which is about 4°C). So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: maybe B is a different compound. Let's think, if G is a sulfate, and when heated, it decomposes. For example, suppose G is Na2SO4·10H2O (gypsum). Heating gypsum would release water and form anhydrous Na2SO4. But the melting point of anhydrous Na2SO4 is around 1326°C, which is way higher than 277 K.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about what B could be. If B's melting point is near 277 K (about 4°C), what is it?

Wait, maybe B is a solid with a low melting point. For example, maybe it's a type of ice. But then B would be H2O, which melts at 273 K, which is 0°C. So 277 K is 4°C, which is a bit higher. So perhaps another form of ice or a different solid?

Alternatively, perhaps B is a different compound. Let me think about other substances. Maybe B is a type of crystal that's close to melting around that temperature. Not sure.

Wait, going back to the initial part: the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. So, the product has exactly two O atoms.

So, when a keto acid reacts with X, the product has two O atoms. A keto acid is an organic acid with a ketone group. For example, acetoacetic acid is a keto acid.

If X is a base, perhaps the reaction is a neutralization, forming a salt. The product would have the structure of the salt. Suppose X is NaOH (a strong base), and the keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid, which when reacts would form sodium acetoacetate. Let's see: the formula of acetoacetic acid is CH3COCH2COOH. Reacting with NaOH would give CH3COCH2COO^- Na^+.

But the product (sodium acetoacetate) has multiple oxygen atoms. Wait, the product must have two O atoms. So perhaps the product is something simpler.

Alternatively, maybe X is a metal, and the keto acid acts as a ligand. Wait, perhaps the reaction is a condensation reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a dehydrating agent. For example, if X is PCl5, which is a reagent used in organic chemistry. Wait, the question says that substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. So X could be something like PCl5 or another reagent.

Wait, let's think about PCl5. It's used in the dehydration of alcohols to make alkenes. But how would that relate to the reaction with Y?

Alternatively, perhaps X is a strong acid, like H2SO4. But H2SO4 is a liquid. So maybe Y is another substance.

Wait, another thought: the precipitate G, when heated, releases B. Suppose G is a carbonate, and upon heating, it decomposes into CO2 and a metal oxide. Then B is the metal oxide. But earlier, I thought B's melting point is near 4°C, but most metal oxides have much higher melting points.

Hmm.

Let me try to think of all the clues again.

Clue 1: X has a heavier isotope of one element. So X could be something like deuterated water (D2O), or a compound with ^18O.

Clue 2: X reacts with Y (liquid) to produce W gas (same protons and neutrons per molecule), precipitate G. Heating G gives B, which has a melting point near 277 K.

Clue 3: When a keto acid reacts with X, the product has two O atoms.

Clue 4: X and especially its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.

Wait, another thought: X could be a heavy isotope of a common reagent. For example, H2O with ^18O is heavy water. But in the reaction, heavy water (X) reacts with another substance (Y) to produce gas W.

Wait, let's consider X as heavy water (D2O). Then, Y could be a strong acid, or perhaps another base.

But if X is D2O and reacts with a metal, say Na, then the reaction would produce NaOD2 and H2 gas. Wait, but H2 has two protons and two neutrons if it's H2, but if it's D2, then each D has 1 proton and 2 neutrons. So D2 would have 2 protons and 4 neutrons. That's unequal, so W can't be D2.

Wait, but in the case of X as H2O (light or heavy), when it reacts with a metal, it produces H2 gas. W would be H2. Each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. So protons (2) vs neutrons (0) — not equal. So W can't be H2.

Hmm. So that doesn't fit.

Another thought: perhaps X is a halogen. For example, if X is Br2 (a liquid), but that might not fit the other clues.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like Cl2O7, which is a heavy molecule. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: The product when a keto acid reacts with X has two O atoms. So perhaps the product is a simple diatomic molecule with two O atoms. Wait, that would be O2 or O3, but those are gases and probably wouldn't make sense in this context.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a salt where the anion has two O atoms. For example, if the keto acid is C2H5COOH (propanoic acid, not a keto acid though), but let's think. Suppose the keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid (CH3COCH2COOH). If X is a base like NaOH, the product would be the sodium salt: CH3COCH2COO^- Na^+. That anion has four O atoms. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the keto acid is something simpler. For example, if the keto acid is something like glyoxylic acid (OHC-COOH), which has two carboxylic groups and a ketone. Reacting with X, which is a base, would form a salt with two O atoms. Wait, but how? The product would have more O atoms.

Hmm, maybe the product isn't a salt but something else. Maybe the keto acid is being dehydrated. For example, if X is a dehydrating agent like PCl5. So, the reaction would drive off water, forming an anhydride. But the product would be the anhydride, which has two O atoms less than the acid. Let's see: glyoxylic acid is OHC-COOH. Dehydration would form OHC-CO-O-... Wait, no, perhaps forming an anhydride would lose a water molecule. So, the product would be OHC-CO-O- (but I'm not sure of the exact structure). Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic anhydride. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an acyl chloride. If X is thionyl chloride (SOCl2), which is a reagent in organic chemistry. Then, a keto acid would react to form an acyl chloride. For example, acetoacetic acid reacting with SOCl2 would form acetoacetyl chloride. But the product would have more O atoms, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the product is an ester, formed by reacting the keto acid with an alcohol. But that would require X to be an alcohol, which doesn't seem to fit the initial clues.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal, and the reaction forms a metal carboxylate. But in that case, the product would have more than two O atoms.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think of a different approach.

Let me think about the elements present in X. The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So, X is a compound with at least two elements, one of which has a heavier isotope.

The options are all numbers around 25-35, which are relatively small, suggesting light elements.

For example, if X is H2O, the elements are H and O. The lightest element would be H (atomic mass ~1), the heaviest O (~16). Sum is 17, which isn't among the options. Hmm.

Wait, but the question says to sum all heavier and lighter isotopes present. Wait, actually, the question says, "the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed."

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me parse it again. It says, take the lightest element in X and the heaviest element in X, sum their atomic masses. But if an element has multiple isotopes, sum all their masses?

Wait, no, maybe it's considering all the isotopes present. So for example, if X has multiple isotopes of an element, we sum their masses. But wait, the question says, "the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X."

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the sum of the lightest and heaviest atomic masses of the elements in X. So, for example, if X is H2O, the elements are H and O. The lightest is H (1), the heaviest is O (16). Sum is 17, which isn't an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X is a diatomic molecule, like O2. But then it's only one element, so the sum would be double the atomic mass. For O, that's 32. But 32 isn't an option either.

Alternatively, if X is CO2, the elements are C and O. Lightest is C (12), heaviest O (16). Sum 28. Not an option.

Wait, the options are 25, 29, 31, 35. Hmm. Let's think of other compounds.

Wait, if X is CH4, the elements are C and H. C is 12, H is 1. Sum is 13. Not an option.

Another compound: NH3. Elements are N and H. N is 14, H is 1. Sum 15. Not an option.

Wait, maybe X is NaOH. Elements are Na (23), O (16), H (1). Lightest is H (1), heaviest Na (23). Sum is 24. Not an option.

Wait, maybe X is something like CH3CH2OH (ethanol). Elements are C, H, O. Lightest H (1), heaviest C (12). Sum 13. Not in options.

Another thought: perhaps X is a diatomic molecule with two different elements, each being a different isotope. But that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, perhaps X is something like D2O (heavy water). The elements are H (deuterium) and O. H is 2 (deuterium), O is 16. Sum is 18. Not an option.

Hmm. Maybe X is a compound with two elements, one of which is a heavy isotope.

Wait, another possibility: X is a compound with elements that include hydrogen and oxygen, but perhaps with a heavier isotope of one.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like CO (carbon monoxide). Elements C (12) and O (16). Sum 28. Not an option.

Wait, maybe X is something else. Let me think about the reaction again.

If X reacts with Y to produce W (same protons and neutrons), precipitate G, which upon heating gives B.

Let me think of a reaction where Y is a liquid, perhaps an acid. X could be a carbonate, which when reacts with acid produces CO2, which would fit W as CO2.

So X is Na2CO3. Then, Y is HCl (a liquid, concentrated). The reaction would be:

Na2CO3 + 2 HCl → 2 NaCl + CO2↑ + H2O.

In this case, W is CO2, which fits the same protons and neutrons (22 each), as earlier thought.

The precipitate G would be NaCl, but NaCl is soluble, so that's not right. So perhaps Y is a different solution.

Wait, maybe Y is a solution of a metal hydroxide. For example, if Y is Ba(OH)2, a liquid, and X is CO2. Then reaction would produce BaCO3 precipitate and water. But then W would be water, which doesn't fit the same protons and neutrons.

Wait, perhaps X is CO2 and Y is a metal, but metals are solids, not liquids.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of a sulfate. For example, BaSO4 is insoluble. So if X is a carbonate, reacting with a sulfate solution could produce a sulfate precipitate. But I'm not sure about the gaseous product.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonate and Y is a nitric acid solution. Then the reaction produces CO2 gas, a precipitate of the metal nitrate? Not sure.

Wait, another angle: the precipitate G, when heated, releases B with a melting point near 277 K. So perhaps G is a carbonate, and when heated, it decomposes to produce B as a metal oxide and CO2 gas.

For example, heating Na2CO3 produces Na2O and CO2. But Na2O has a high melting point, not near 4°C.

Alternatively, perhaps G is something else. Wait, maybe it's a bicarbonate. Heating NaHCO3 produces Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. But Na2CO3 is solid, not a liquid.

Hmm. I'm not making much progress here. Let me try to think of another approach.

The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X has two O atoms. So the product is a compound with exactly two O atoms. Let's think of a simple product.

If the product is something like CH3COO-R, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is an ester. For example, if the keto acid is ethyl glyoxylic acid, but that's not making sense.

Alternatively, maybe the product is something like CH3COCl (acetyl chloride). That would have two O atoms. But that would require X to be SOCl2, which is a reagent in organic chemistry. Let's see.

If X is SOCl2, which is a liquid. Then, reacting a keto acid (like acetoacetic acid) would produce an acyl chloride. For example:

CH3COCH2COOH + SOCl2 → CH3COCH2COCl + SO2↑ + HCl↑.

Wait, but the product (CH3COCH2COCl) has four O atoms (in COCl groups). So that doesn't fit the two O atoms condition. So that's not it.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone. But how? Maybe the keto acid is being decarboxylated. For example, using a reagent like P2O5, which is a dehydrating agent. So:

R-C(=O)-COOH → R-C(=O)-CH3 + CO2.

But then the product would be an alkane or something else. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: The product of the reaction has two O atoms. Maybe it's a molecule like O2 or O3, but those are gases and wouldn't form a solid precipitate.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a peroxide, which has O-O bonds. But I'm not sure.

This is getting complicated. Let me try to think of what the possible elements in X are, given the options.

The options are 25, 29, 31, 35. Wait, the question says to sum the lightest and heaviest elements. So let's think of possible element pairs where their atomic masses add up to one of these options.

For example:

- Lightest H (1), heaviest Cl (35.5) → sum is around 36.5. Close to option A)35. But perhaps the question uses rounded values.

- H (1) and O (16) → sum 17. Not in options.

- C (12) and O (16) → sum 28. Close to option D)29.

But 28 isn't an option, but 29 is. Maybe considering isotopes.

Wait, another pair: N (14) and O (16) → sum 30, which isn't an option.

Wait, another pair: C (12) and F (19) → sum 31, which is option C.

But why would X have C and F? For example, if X is CF4, which is carbon tetrafluoride. But that's a gas, not a liquid. Hmm.

Wait, another pair: B (8) and F (19) → sum 27. Not an option.

Wait, another possibility: if X is something like NH3 (which has N and H). Sum is 14 +1=15. Not in options.

Alternatively, if X is CH4 (C and H), sum 12+1=13. Not an option.

Wait, another pair: O (16) and F (19). Sum 35. So option A is 35.

But then, what compound would have O and F? Perhaps in a molecule like O-F, but that's not a common compound.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like KClO3, which has K, Cl, O. Then lightest is Cl (35.5), heaviest K (39.1). Sum is around 74.6, which doesn't match any option.

Hmm. Another approach: Let's consider the options. The answer must be one of A, B, C, D: 35, 25, 31, 29.

Looking at these numbers, 31 is 12 (C) + 19 (F) =31. So if X contains C and F, their sum is 31. Which is option C. So, perhaps X is a compound with C and F.

What's a common reagent in organic chemistry that contains C and F? Tetrachloroethylene, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, something like chloroform (CHCl3), but it's C, H, Cl. Sum would be H (1) and Cl (35.5) → 36.5. Close to option A (35), but not exact.

Alternatively, if X is Cl2 (elemental chlorine), but Cl has an atomic mass of ~35.5. So if the substance X is Cl2, the sum of lightest and heaviest elements (both Cl) would be 35.5 +35.5 =71. Not matching any option.

Wait, another thought: Maybe X is a compound with two different isotopes of the same element. For example, if X is a molecule with H and D (deuterium). Then, the elements are both H, so the sum is 1 +2 =3, which is not an option.

Hmm, I'm not making progress here.

Let me think again about the possible elements. Perhaps X has O and another element.

If the sum is 29 (option D), possible elements could be O (16) and something with mass 13. But 13 is Al. O and Al would sum to 29. So if X has O and Al, but what compound?

Another possibility is O (16) and Na (23). 16+23=39, which is option A (35) is close but not exact.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the elements are F (19) and O (16). Sum is 35, which is option A.

So if X contains F and O, their sum is 35. So which compound has F and O? Perhaps O-F, but that's not a common compound. Alternatively, perhaps X is something like OF2, which is diatomic. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound like CaF2, which has Ca and F. Then the elements are Ca (40) and F (19). Sum 40+19=59. Not an option.

Wait, another thought: Maybe X contains Boron and Oxygen. B is 11, O is 16. Sum 27. Not an option.

Alternatively, X could contain S (32) and O (16). Sum 48. Not an option.

I think I'm stuck on this part. Let me try to think of another angle.

The question says that when a keto acid reacts with X, the product has two O atoms. So the product has exactly two O atoms.

A simple molecule with two O atoms could be O2, but that's a gas. Alternatively, maybe it's a simple oxide, like CO or NO.

Wait, but how would that form from a keto acid reacting with X?

Alternatively, perhaps X is a catalyst. But that doesn't seem to fit with the initial reaction description.

Wait, perhaps X is a reducing agent. For example, if X is NaBH4, which is used in organic chemistry. Then, reacting with a keto acid... Not sure.

Alternatively, X could be a metal, and the reaction with a keto acid forms a salt. For example, if X is Mg, then Mg reacts with the keto acid to form Mg salt. But the product would have more O atoms.

Another thought: If X is a halogen, like Cl2, and the keto acid is something that can react with Cl2. But I'm not sure what the product would be.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diatomic molecule with two O atoms, like O2. But I don't see how that would form from a keto acid and X.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone, which has one O atom. But the product needs two.

Hmm. I'm not making progress here. Let me try to think about the possible options again.

The options are 25, 29, 31, 35. Which sum could correspond to which element pairs.

Option C is 31, which is about C (12) and F (19). So if X is a compound with C and F, like CHClF2, but that's speculative.

Alternatively, another possibility: perhaps X is a compound with elements that have atomic masses adding to 31. So 31. Let me think of elements that sum to 31 when their lightest and heaviest are considered.

Let's think of possible element pairs:

- O (16) and Na (23): 16 +23 =39 (option A is 35, close but no).

- F (19) and C (12): 19+12=31 (option C).

So, if X contains C and F, the sum is 31, which is option C.

So perhaps X is a compound like TFE (tetrafluoroethylene), but I'm not sure how that would fit the reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like chloroform (CHCl3), but that has C, H, and Cl.

Wait, but if X is a compound with C and F, then the sum of lightest (C:12) and heaviest (F:19) is 31, option C.

So, I'm starting to think the answer might be option C, 31.

Let me try to tie this back to the reaction.

If X is a compound with C and F, perhaps it's used as a reagent in organic chemistry, like TFE or something else. But I'm not sure.

Also, the reaction would produce W gas, which has the same number of protons and neutrons. If X is CF4, which is a gas, but Y is a liquid. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like PCl3, which is a reagent. PCl3 has P and Cl. Atomic masses: P is ~31, Cl is ~35.5. Sum would be around 66.5, which is not an option.

Wait, perhaps X is a diatomic molecule, like Cl2. Then, the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements (both Cl) would be ~35.5 +35.5=71, which is not an option.

Hmm.

Given the time I've spent, I think I'll have to make an educated guess based on the earlier analysis. The product of the reaction between a keto acid and X has two O atoms, and X is a reagent in organic chemistry. One possible compound that fits this is something like SOCl2, which is used in organic synthesis. SOCl2 has S and Cl. The lightest is Cl (35.5), the heaviest S (32.07). Sum is approximately 67.57, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound with C and O. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Another possibility: X is a heavy water isotope, like D2O. The elements are H (2, since it's deuterium) and O (16). Sum is 18, not an option.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C, 31. Based on the earlier reasoning where C and F sum to 31.

The problem involves identifying the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Key Observations and Clues**:
   - Substance X reacts with liquid Y to produce gas W, which has the same number of protons and neutrons in its molecule.
   - A precipitate G forms during the reaction, which releases B upon heating. The melting point of B is approximately 277 K (4°C).
   - The product of the reaction between a keto acid and X contains exactly two oxygen atoms.
   - X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.

2. **Analysis of Gas W**:
   - Gas W must have an equal number of protons and neutrons. Possible candidates include CO₂ (22 protons and 22 neutrons) or N₂ (14 protons and 14 neutrons). However, CO₂ aligns better with the reaction context.

3. **Precipitate G and Its Heating**:
   - G is a precipitate that forms during the reaction. Upon heating, it releases B, which has a melting point close to 277 K. This suggests B could be a solid with a low melting point, possibly related to a metal oxide or carbonate decomposition.

4. **Reaction with a Keto Acid**:
   - The product of the reaction between a keto acid and X contains exactly two oxygen atoms. This implies a simple compound, such as an ester, anhydride, or a diatomic molecule like O₂.

5. **Atomic Masses of Elements in X**:
   - The question requires summing the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X, considering isotopes. The options provided are 25, 29, 31, and 35.
   - Possible element pairs and their sums:
     - **C (12) + F (19)**: Sum = 31 (Option C).
     - **H (1) + Cl (35.5)**: Sum ≈ 36.5 (close to Option A, 35).
     - **C (12) + O (16)**: Sum = 28 (close to Option D, 29).
     - **O (16) + F (19)**: Sum = 35 (Option A).

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible answer is **Option C (31)**, corresponding to the elements carbon (C) and fluorine (F). This aligns with the possibility that X is a compound like tetrafluoroethylene (TFE) or a similar reagent used in organic chemistry.
