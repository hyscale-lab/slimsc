Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details.

An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After colliding, they annihilate and produce two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured—one moving upper-right and the other lower-right. The question is asking for the angle between the directions of the photons. The options are A) 74, B) 172, C)138, D)96 degrees.

Hmm. Okay, so first, I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons. In the case of an electron and a positron, they annihilate into two photons. Since the electron and positron are moving towards each other, the system is closed, and energy and momentum must be conserved.

Wait, the problem states that both photons have the same energy. So, that's an important point. So, the two photons have the same energy but different directions. One is upper-right, the other lower-right. So, their directions are symmetric in some way, perhaps.

I think about conservation of momentum. Since the initial particles are moving along the horizontal axis, the total momentum should be along that axis. The photons' momenta must add up to that same total momentum. But since both photons are moving in the right direction but different vertical directions, their momenta vectors might be arranged symmetrically about the horizontal axis.

Wait, but the electron and positron have different Lorentz factors. So, their speeds are different, which affects their momenta and energies.

Wait, let me think about the initial momenta.

The Lorentz factor gamma is γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). The electron and positron have the same mass, so their relativistic momenta can be calculated based on their velocities. But since they're moving towards each other, their momenta are in opposite directions.

Wait, but the electron is moving from the left with gamma 4. So, the positron is moving from the right with gamma 2. So, their velocities are in opposite directions along the x-axis.

Let me compute their initial momenta. The momentum p is gamma * m * v. But I can also express p in terms of gamma and the rest mass energy. Alternatively, since E = gamma m c², and p = gamma m v. So, for each particle, the momentum is (gamma m v) in their respective directions.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to compute their momenta in terms of their energies. Because when they annihilate, the energy of the photons will come from the total rest mass energy plus their kinetic energies.

Wait, but wait. The electron and positron have rest mass energy equal to mc² each. When they annihilate, the total rest mass energy is 2mc². But they also have kinetic energy because they're moving.

So, the total energy before annihilation is the sum of their energies. Let me calculate each's energy.

The electron has gamma 4. So, its energy E_e = gamma * m_e c² = 4 m_e c².

The positron has gamma 2. So, E_p = 2 m_e c².

So, the total energy is 4m_e c² + 2m_e c² = 6 m_e c².

After annihilation, the two photons' energies add up to 6 m_e c². But the problem says both photons have the same energy. So each photon has energy E_photon = 3 m_e c². Hmm, that makes sense because 2 * 3 =6.

Wait, but wait. When particles annihilate, they produce at least two photons because of conservation of momentum. If they were at rest, they would produce two photons in opposite directions. But in this case, the initial system has some momentum, so the photons must carry that away.

So, the initial momentum is the sum of the momenta of the electron and positron. Let's compute that.

The electron is moving to the right (since it's coming from the left). Its momentum is p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e. But wait, since gamma is given, perhaps I can express p in terms of gamma and beta (beta = v/c).

Alternatively, since p = gamma m v, and v = beta c, so p = gamma m beta c.

Wait, another approach: Since each particle's momentum is in opposite directions, the total initial momentum is p_e (electron) minus p_p (positron, since it's moving to the left, perhaps), or the other way around.

Wait, the electron is moving from the left towards the right, so its momentum is positive. The positron is moving from the right towards the left, so its momentum is negative. So, the total initial momentum is p_e (positive) + p_p (negative). Wait, no, wait: the positron is moving from the right, so its velocity is towards the left. So, its momentum is negative. So, the total initial momentum is p_e (positive) + (-p_p) = p_e - p_p.

So, let's compute p_e and p_p.

p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e. But v_e = beta_e c. And beta_e = sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma_e)^2) ) = sqrt(1 - 1/16) )= sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.968 c.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Beta is v/c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta²). So, beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). For gamma_e =4, beta_e = sqrt(1-1/16)=sqrt(15/16)=sqrt(15)/4≈0.968.

Similarly, gamma_p=2, so beta_p=sqrt(1-1/4)=sqrt(3/4)=sqrt(3)/2≈0.866.

So, p_e = gamma_e * m_e * beta_e c = 4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4) c = m_e * sqrt(15) c.

Wait, simplifying: 4 * (sqrt(15)/4 )= sqrt(15). So p_e = m_e c sqrt(15). Similarly, p_p = gamma_p * m_e * beta_p c = 2 * m_e * (sqrt(3)/2) c = m_e c sqrt(3).

So the total momentum initially is p_initial = p_e - p_p = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Wait, because the positron's momentum is in the opposite direction. So, if the electron's momentum is positive, the positron's is negative. Hence, p_initial = p_e (positive) + (-p_p) = p_e - p_p.

So, p_initial = [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)] m_e c.

Now, after annihilation, the two photons must carry this momentum. The photons' momenta must add up to the same total, and their energies must each be 3 m_e c².

Wait, because the total energy is 6 m_e c², each photon has energy 3 m_e c².

Photons have energy E = h f = pc, so p = E/(c). So each photon's momentum is p_photon = E_photon / c = (3 m_e c²)/c = 3 m_e c.

Wait, but wait. The direction of each photon's momentum is the same as their direction. So, one photon is moving upper-right, the other lower-right. So their momenta are in the first and fourth quadrants, respectively, if we consider the positive x-axis as right.

Wait, but how does their momentum vector look? Let me think of each photon's momentum vector as (p_x, p_y). Since the photons are moving in upper-right and lower-right, their y-components are positive and negative, respectively.

But their total momentum must be the same as the initial momentum, which is along the positive x-axis. So, the sum of the two photons' momenta must be along the x-axis. That implies that the y-components of their momenta must cancel each other out.

Wait, but both photons have the same energy, so their magnitudes of momentum are the same. So, each photon's momentum has a magnitude of 3 m_e c.

The initial momentum is [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)] m_e c along the x-axis.

So, the sum of the x-components of the two photons' momenta must equal [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)] m_e c.

Let me denote the two photons as photon A and B. Photon A is moving upper-right, and photon B is lower-right.

Let me represent their momenta as vectors. Photon A: (p_Ax, p_Ay), Photon B: (p_Bx, p_By).

The sum of their momenta should be (p_Ax + p_Bx, p_Ay + p_By) = (initial_p, 0), since the initial momentum is along the x-axis.

But since both photons have the same magnitude of momentum, |p_A| = |p_B| = 3 m_e c.

So, I can write:

p_Ax = 3 m_e c * cos(theta)

p_Ay = 3 m_e c * sin(theta)

Similarly, for photon B, since it's moving in the lower-right direction, its angle with the x-axis is -theta (assuming symmetry). So,

p_Bx = 3 m_e c * cos(theta)

p_By = -3 m_e c * sin(theta)

Wait, but that would imply that the y-components cancel each other when summed: p_Ay + p_By = 3 m_e c sin(theta) - 3 m_e c sin(theta) = 0. That's correct because the total y-momentum is zero.

Now, the sum of the x-components is p_Ax + p_Bx = 2 * 3 m_e c cos(theta) = 6 m_e c cos(theta).

This sum should equal the initial momentum:

6 m_e c cos(theta) = [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)] m_e c.

We can cancel m_e c from both sides:

6 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).

So, cos(theta) = [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)] / 6.

Compute the value of [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)] / 6.

Let me compute numerically.

sqrt(15) ≈ 3.87298

sqrt(3) ≈ 1.73205

So, their difference is approximately 3.87298 - 1.73205 ≈ 2.14093.

Divide by 6: 2.14093 / 6 ≈ 0.35682.

So, cos(theta) ≈ 0.35682.

Then theta ≈ arccos(0.35682). Let me calculate that.

Using a calculator, arccos(0.3568) is approximately 69 degrees. Wait, because cos(60) is 0.5, cos(90)=0. So, 0.356 is around 69, maybe 69.3 degrees.

But wait, the angle each photon makes with the x-axis is theta. So, the first photon is at +theta, the second at -theta. The angle between them would be 2 theta.

So 2 * 69.3 ≈ 138.6 degrees. Looking at the options, option C is 138 degrees.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Compute [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)] ≈ 3.87298 - 1.73205 = 2.14093.

Divide by 6: ~0.35682.

Arccos(0.35682) is about 69 degrees, so angle between photons is 2 * 69 = 138 degrees. Which is option C.

Let me check if I considered the correct direction for the positron's momentum.

Wait, earlier I said the positron's momentum is in the opposite direction because it's moving from the right. So, positron's momentum is to the left, so its momentum is negative. So the total initial momentum is p_e (to the right, positive) minus p_p (to the left, which is positive in our coordinate system? Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps I should think about their directions more carefully.

Electron: moving from left to right, so positive x direction.

Positron: moving from right to left, which is negative x direction.

So, their momenta are p_e (positive) and p_p (negative). So, total momentum is p_e - p_p.

Wait, but I calculated p_e as m_e c sqrt(15) and p_p as m_e c sqrt(3). So, p_initial = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Wait, but let me make sure that I didn't get the positron's momentum sign wrong.

Wait, if the positron is moving to the left (negative x), then its momentum is - p_p, where p_p is its magnitude.

So the total momentum is p_e (right) + (- p_p) (left) = p_e - p_p.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, so the total initial momentum is (sqrt(15) m_e c) - (sqrt(3) m_e c). So, sqrt(15) is larger than sqrt(3), so the total momentum is positive, which makes sense because the electron is moving faster (gamma is higher) so its momentum is bigger.

So the calculation for cos(theta) as [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)]/(6) is correct.

So, the angle between the two photons is 2 theta, which is approximately 138 degrees. So the correct option is C.

Wait, but wait another thing: the problem states that both photons have the same energy. So, each has E_photon = 3 m_e c².

But photons' momenta are vectors. So, their x-components add up to the initial momentum, and their y-components cancel each other.

So, I think the approach is correct. The angle between the two photons is 2 theta, which is about 138 degrees, so option C is the right answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the collision and annihilation of an electron and a positron, producing two photons of equal energy. The goal is to determine the angle between the directions of the photons.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Initial Energy and Momentum**:
   - The electron has a Lorentz factor of 4, so its energy is \( E_e = \gamma_e m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2 \).
   - The positron has a Lorentz factor of 2, so its energy is \( E_p = \gamma_p m_e c^2 = 2 m_e c^2 \).
   - Total energy before annihilation is \( E_{\text{total}} = E_e + E_p = 6 m_e c^2 \).

   After annihilation, the two photons share this energy equally, so each photon has energy \( E_{\text{photon}} = 3 m_e c^2 \).

2. **Initial Momentum**:
   - The electron's momentum is \( p_e = \gamma_e m_e v_e = \gamma_e m_e \beta_e c = 4 m_e c \cdot \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4} = m_e c \sqrt{15} \).
   - The positron's momentum is \( p_p = \gamma_p m_e v_p = \gamma_p m_e \beta_p c = 2 m_e c \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = m_e c \sqrt{3} \).
   - Since the positron moves left (negative x-direction), its momentum is subtracted: \( p_{\text{initial}} = p_e - p_p = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}) \).

3. **Photon Momentum and Conservation of Momentum**:
   - Each photon has momentum \( p_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{photon}}}{c} = \frac{3 m_e c^2}{c} = 3 m_e c \).
   - Let the photons make angles \( +\theta \) and \( -\theta \) with the x-axis. Their momentum components are:
     \[
     p_{A_x} = 3 m_e c \cos\theta, \quad p_{A_y} = 3 m_e c \sin\theta
     \]
     \[
     p_{B_x} = 3 m_e c \cos\theta, \quad p_{B_y} = -3 m_e c \sin\theta
     \]
   - The y-components cancel (\( p_{A_y} + p_{B_y} = 0 \)), and the x-components sum to the initial momentum:
     \[
     p_{A_x} + p_{B_x} = 2 \cdot 3 m_e c \cos\theta = 6 m_e c \cos\theta
     \]
     \[
     6 m_e c \cos\theta = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3})
     \]
     \[
     \cos\theta = \frac{\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}}{6}
     \]

4. **Angle Calculation**:
   - Compute \( \cos\theta \):
     \[
     \cos\theta = \frac{\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}}{6} \approx \frac{3.87298 - 1.73205}{6} \approx 0.35682
     \]
   - Find \( \theta \) using \( \arccos(0.35682) \approx 69^\circ \).
   - The angle between the photons is \( 2\theta \approx 2 \cdot 69^\circ = 138^\circ \).

### Conclusion:
The angle between the directions of the photons is approximately \( 138^\circ \), which corresponds to option **C**.
