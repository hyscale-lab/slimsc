Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, the question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. I remember that in such a system, the potential is V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r², which sounds familiar because it's similar to the 3D version of the harmonic oscillator.

The problem is asking about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions with that energy. So I need to find both the energy value and the degeneracy for that state.

Wait, harmonic oscillators in 3D are often treated by considering each dimension separately. Oh right, because in 3D, the potential splits into x², y², z² terms, so the total energy is the sum of each direction's energy. So the energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω, where n_x, n_y, n_z are non-negative integers (0,1,2,...).

Wait, but another way I remember it is that in 3D, the energy levels can be expressed in terms of a quantum number n, where n = n_x + n_y + n_z. So each state with the same n has the same energy, and the degeneracy is related to the number of ways you can get n as the sum of three non-negative integers.

So the ground state is n=0: n_x = n_y = n_z = 0. Its energy is (3/2) ħω.

The first excited state would be n=1. How many ways can you write 1 as the sum of three non-negative integers? It's the number of permutations of (1,0,0). So that's 3 ways. The energy here is (1 + 3/2) ħω = (5/2) ħω.

The second excited state would be n=2. The possible combinations are two possibilities: either one of the n's is 2 and the others are 0, or two are 1 and one is 0. Wait, no, wait—n=2 means n_x +n_y +n_z=2. So the possible distributions are (2,0,0), (0,2,0), (0,0,2), (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1). That's 6 possibilities. So the degeneracy is 6. The energy is (2 +3/2) ħω = (7/2) ħω.

Wait, but what about the third excited state? Let me think. The ground state is n=0, first excited n=1, second n=2, third n=3. So for n=3, the energy is (3 +3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. Now, how many ways are there to write 3 as the sum of three non-negative integers? That's the same as finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z =3.

The formula for the number of solutions is (3 +3 -1 choose 3-1) = (5 choose 2) = 10. So the degeneracy is 10.

Wait, but wait, the options have 10 as an option for the number of eigenfunctions. Looking at the options, option A is (9/2) ħω with 10 eigenfunctions. Option C is (9/2) ħω with 3. So for the third excited state, the energy would be (9/2) ħω and the degeneracy is 10.

Wait, but hold on. Are the excited states ordered correctly? Let me make sure. The ground state is n=0, which is the zeroth state. Then first excited is n=1, second n=2, third n=3. So third excited state corresponds to n=3. So energy is (n + 3/2) ħω → (3 + 3/2) = 9/2 ħω. So the energy part is correct for option A.

The number of eigenfunctions with n=3 is 10, so option A has 10. Option C has 3, which doesn't fit. So the correct answer should be option A.

Wait, but looking back at the options, I also see that option B and D have expressions with pi squared and r squared, which doesn't make sense for energy in this context. Because the harmonic oscillator energy is quantized in multiples of ħω. So options B and D can be eliminated because their energy terms don't fit the harmonic oscillator form.

So the only possible correct option is A: (9/2) ħω, 10 eigenfunctions.

So the answer is A.

The problem involves a quantum mechanical system of a particle of mass $m$ in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, $V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2$. The energy levels for such a system are given by $E = \left(n_x + n_y + n_z + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega$, where $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are non-negative integers representing the quantum numbers in the $x$, $y$, and $z$ directions, respectively. The total quantum number is $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, and states with the same $n$ have the same energy.

The degeneracy of each energy level corresponds to the number of ways to distribute $n$ quanta among the three directions, which is given by the combinatorial formula $\text{degeneracy} = \binom{n + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{n + 2}{2}$.

1. **Ground State ($n=0$):**  
   Energy: $E = \frac{3}{2} \hbar \omega$, Degeneracy: $\binom{0 + 2}{2} = 1$.

2. **First Excited State ($n=1$):**  
   Energy: $E = \frac{5}{2} \hbar \omega$, Degeneracy: $\binom{1 + 2}{2} = 3$.

3. **Second Excited State ($n=2$):**  
   Energy: $E = \frac{7}{2} \hbar \omega$, Degeneracy: $\binom{2 + 2}{2} = 6$.

4. **Third Excited State ($n=3$):**  
   Energy: $E = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega$, Degeneracy: $\binom{3 + 2}{2} = 10$.

The question asks for the energy and degeneracy of the third excited state, which corresponds to $n=3$. The energy is $\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega$, and the degeneracy is 10.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A:** $(9/2) \hbar \omega, 10$ — Correct.
- **Option B:** Contains terms with $\pi^2$ and $r^2$, which are not relevant for the energy of a harmonic oscillator. Incorrect.
- **Option C:** $(9/2) \hbar \omega, 3$ — Incorrect degeneracy.
- **Option D:** Contains terms with $\pi^2$ and $r^2$, which are not relevant for the energy of a harmonic oscillator. Incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**.
