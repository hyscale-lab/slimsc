Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct formula of an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the question says the compound was analyzed using FTIR, ¹H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Let's break down each piece of information.

First, the FTIR spectrum. There's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, if it's a very broad peak, maybe it's something more acidic, like a carboxylic acid? Or perhaps an alcohol, but the broadness could mean hydrogen bonding, which is common in -OH groups.

Then, there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 region is typical for carbonyl groups (C=O). So that could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 might be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring's C=C stretching. Or, wait, could it be an amide? But amide carbonyls are usually a bit lower, like around 1650 maybe? Hmm, not sure.

Next, the ¹H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to double bonds, like in alkenes. So the compound has a double bond, probably somewhere. That would explain the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak if it's an aromatic ring, but then the 1700 would be the carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is a conjugated double bond, like in a ketone or ester.

Looking at the mass spectrum, there's a fragment peak at m/z = 45. I need to think about what fragments correspond to 45. Common fragments: the methyl group (CH3+) is 15, but that's not it. Maybe a CO group? Let me think. The fragment at 45 could be a CH2O group, which is 30 (CH2 is 15, O is 16; but maybe not). Wait, another possibility: the CH3O group is 31. Hmm, maybe it's a larger fragment. Oh wait, the ketene ion (like in a diketone) might not be it. Alternatively, the fragment at 45 could be a CH2CH2O group or maybe something else.

Wait, another approach. The molecular formula options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O2. Let's calculate the molecular weights:

C6H12O: (6*12)+(12*1)+(16) = 72 +12 +16=100 g/mol
C6H10O: 72 +10 +16=98
C6H10O2: 72 +10 +32=114
C6H12O2:72+12+32=116

But wait, the mass spec shows a fragment at m/z=45, which is lower than the molecular weight. So perhaps it's a fragment that's part of the molecule.

Let me think about possible functional groups. The FTIR suggests maybe a carbonyl group (1700 cm⁻¹) and another functional group like an alcohol or carboxylic acid (the broad peak). The NMR indicates vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is present.

So maybe the compound is an ester with a double bond. Or perhaps a ketone with an alcohol group. Or maybe a carboxylic acid with a double bond.

Wait, another thought: the presence of two strong peaks in FTIR at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Maybe the 1700 is a carbonyl, like an ester or ketone, and the 1650 could be an aromatic ring (like in a benzene ring), but then why the vinyl hydrogens in NMR? Alternatively, the 1650 could be a conjugated double bond, like in an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone.

Let me think about the possible formulas.

Option C is C6H10O2. That would make sense for an ester or a ketone with an alcohol group, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond?

Wait, the molecular formula for an ester would be R-O-CO-R', so the formula would be something like CnH2mO2. Let's see, for example, ethyl acetate is C4H8O2. So for the options, C6H10O2 has 6 carbons, 10 hydrogens, and two oxygens. If it's an ester, the degree of unsaturation would be:

Degree of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Let's calculate:

For C6H10O2: C=6, H=10, O=2. So (2*6 +2 -10 -0)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees of unsaturation. That could be a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds, or a triple bond and a ring, etc.

But the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, which implies a double bond. So another degree could be a ring, perhaps. Like a cyclic ester with a double bond. Alternatively, a benzene ring (which is three degrees, but that doesn't fit here). So maybe a ring isn't present. Or perhaps a carbonyl and a double bond.

Wait, another point: the mass spec fragment. The peak at m/z=45. Let me think about possible fragments that sum up to 45.

Molecular formulas that have a mass of 45: like C3H6O (which is 45: 3*12=36, 6*1=6, 16=16; 36+6+16=58. Oh wait, that's too big. Hmm.)

Wait, wait, 45 is the mass-to-charge. Maybe it's the molecular ion of a fragment. So what's 45? 45 is 45 g/mol. Let me think of compounds with m/z=45. Let's see: HCOOH (formic acid) is 46. Close, but not quite. Or maybe CH3COH (propanal? No, that's 58 for CH3CHO). Hmm. Wait, another approach: 45 could be the (CH2)2O group? But (CH2)2O is O(C2H4), which is 44 (12*2 +4 +16= 24+4+16=44). So that's close but not 45.

Alternatively, maybe a fragment with a CO group. Like, CH2CO would be 44 (12*2 + 2 +16=44 again). Hmm. Wait, maybe the fragment is CH3COO-? Which would be 60? No, that's higher. Or perhaps a ketene ion? I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, let me think about the possible molecular formulas and their possible fragments. Suppose the compound is an ester, such as methyl something. For example, methyl propenoate would be CH2=CHCOOCH3. Let's see, that would have molecular formula C5H8O2. Wait, but our options are C6H10O2 or C6H12O2, etc. So perhaps another structure.

Alternatively, think about the molecular formula for the options. Let's think about each possible option and see which fits the data.

Option A: C6H12O2. The degree of unsaturation is (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one degree of unsaturation. That could be a double bond or a ring. But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond. Then, the IR shows a carbonyl (1700), so that's one double bond (from the carbonyl) and another from the vinyl. Wait, that would be two degrees of unsaturation, but the formula only allows one. Hmm, that doesn't add up. Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, Degree of Unsaturation formula:

DOU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2

Assuming no halogens or nitrogens, X=0, N=0.

So for option A (C6H12O2):

DOU = (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 1.

So one degree of unsaturation, which could be a ring or a double bond. But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens (a double bond), so that's one. But the IR peak at 1700 suggests a carbonyl group, which is a double bond (C=O). So that's two double bonds, which would imply two degrees of unsaturation, but the formula only allows one. So that's a problem. So option A can't be right.

Option B: C6H10O. DOU = (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees. That could be a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds. But the NMR has vinyl H, implying a double bond. The IR has a carbonyl (1700) and another peak at 1650. Wait, but if the formula is C6H10O, maybe it's a cyclic ketone? Like cyclohexanone? But then the IR would have the 1700, but where would the 1650 come from? Unless there's another group, but the formula only has one O.

Wait, another possibility: maybe a conjugated diene and a carbonyl group, but that would need two double bonds, which would require two degrees of unsaturation. So for C6H10O, two degrees fit.

But what about the IR? The 1700 could be a ketone or aldehyde. The 1650 could be an aromatic ring (but that's three DOU), or another functional group. Hmm, not sure.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degree of unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -10 -0)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees. So maybe a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds.

The IR has a carbonyl (1700) which is a double bond, and another peak at 1650. Maybe an ester group? Esters have two oxygen atoms. The ester carbonyl is around 1700. The 1650 could be a conjugated double bond, like in an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester.

In such a case, the structure could be something like CH2=CHCOOR, which would have a double bond in the ester group. That would explain the NMR vinyl hydrogens.

Let me think about the mass spectrum. If the molecular ion fragments, what would give a 45 m/z? Let's assume the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, like methyl acrylate, which is CH2=CHCOOCH3. Its molecular formula is C5H8O2. Wait, but our options here are C6H10O2. So perhaps a longer chain.

For example, maybe something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. That would be C6H10O2. So when the molecule fragments, perhaps the ester group breaks, or the double bond breaks.

Wait, another approach: the fragment at 45 could correspond to the loss of something. Suppose the molecule has a (CH2CH2O) group. Let's see: CH2CH2O would be C2H4O, which is 44. Close to 45. Not exactly. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a ketene ion, which has a m/z of 45? Hmm, I'm not very sure about the exact masses here.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a CH2CH2O group plus something else. But I'm not quite getting it. Let me think about the molecular formula.

C6H10O2. If it's an ester, perhaps the structure is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. Then, during fragmentation, maybe the ester breaks into the acid part and the alcohol part. The acid part would be CH2=CHCOOH (but that's 72 g/mol), which is larger than 45. Alternatively, maybe the molecule breaks in a way that a smaller fragment like CH2CH2O (44) comes off, but that doesn't match 45.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the fragment is the acylium ion, like (RCO)+. If the R is CH2CH2, then RCO would be C3H6O, which is 58. Hmm, no. Alternatively, maybe a smaller group.

Wait, maybe the fragment is an ethylene group (CH2CH2), but that's 28. Not 45.

Hmm, maybe the 45 is from the loss of something. Let's say the molecular ion is at higher m/z, and the fragment is 45.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. If it's a six-membered ring, with a double bond and an ester group. But I'm not sure.

Let me think about another angle. The presence of two O's in the formula. The FTIR shows a broad peak, which might indicate an -OH group, like in an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But if it's an ester, the O's would be in the ester group. Alternatively, if the compound is a beta-keto ester, which has two carbonyl groups.

Wait, beta-keto esters have the structure RCOCOR', so two carbonyl groups. That would fit the IR peaks at 1700 and 1650. The 1700 for the ester carbonyl, and the 1650 for the ketone carbonyl.

But wait, the formula for beta-keto esters would have more oxygen if it's a di-ester, but in this case, the options have two O's. So perhaps not a beta-keto ester.

Alternatively, maybe the two peaks are from two different carbonyl groups, but that may not fit the formula.

Wait, let me think about the possible structures for each option.

Option C is C6H10O2. So, two oxygen atoms. If it's an ester, it's R-O-CO-R'. The formula would be (CnH2mO) (COOR'). Let's think about possible structures. For example, methyl cyclopentene carboxylate? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. Like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. So that's C6H10O2. The IR would show the ester carbonyl at ~1700, and the conjugated double bond at ~1650. That fits. The NMR would show vinyl hydrogens as the double bond.

Now, the mass spectrum. If the molecule fragments, perhaps the ester group breaks. Let's see, the ester group is O-CO-O. When it breaks, perhaps the molecule cleaves into two parts. Alternatively, the double bond could cause a fragment.

Wait, I'm trying to think of what fragment would have a mass of 45. Let me calculate the possible fragments.

Suppose the molecule is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. The molecular weight is 6 carbons: 6*12=72, 10 H: 10, 2 O:32. 72+10+32=114.

If the molecule breaks after the ester oxygen, maybe we get the acid part (CH2=CHCOOH) which is 72 + 2 + 16 +16 +1? Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the molecule breaks in a way that a CH2CH2O group is formed, but that's 44.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment at 45 could be the result of losing a larger portion. For example, the main chain breaks, and a smaller fragment is left. Let's imagine that the molecule is something like CH2=CHCOO-R, where R is CH2CH2CH3. If the ester group breaks, perhaps the R-O-CO part could fragment.

Alternatively, perhaps the double bond is involved in a fragment. For example, the molecule could cleave at the double bond, forming a smaller fragment. If the double bond is between C1 and C2, then breaking there would give a CH2 group and a CHCOOCH2CH2CH3 group. But that's 72 + 32 = 104, which is higher than 45.

Wait, maybe the fragment is the acylium ion. For example, if the ester group breaks into RCO+ and OR-. The RCO+ would be CH2=CHCOO+ (but that's 72?), not sure. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is just the acylium ion of a smaller group.

Alternatively, think about the possibility of a methyl group attached to something. Wait, if the molecule is CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH3 (but that's a straight-chain ester without a double bond). The NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so the double bond must be present.

Hmm, another approach: the molecular formula C6H10O2 has a degree of unsaturation of 2. So two double bonds or a ring plus a double bond. Since the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, one double bond is present. The other could be a ring or another double bond.

Wait, but the IR has two peaks in the carbonyl region. That suggests two carbonyl groups. But the formula only has two oxygens. So perhaps it's a cyclic anhydride, but that's less likely. Alternatively, maybe a cyclic ester with a double bond.

Wait, a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond would have the structure like a ring with an ester linkage and a double bond. For example, a six-membered ring with an ester group and a double bond. Let me see: a six-membered ring with an ester would require an oxygen in the ring. So maybe a gamma-lactone, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a diester, but that would require more oxygens. No, wait, C6H10O2 has two oxygens, so it's a mono-ester.

Wait, another angle. The IR has a broad peak at 3000 cm-1. That's more consistent with an -OH group (like in an alcohol or carboxylic acid) than an ester (which usually has a sharp peak around 2200 for the C=O, but esters have a C-O stretch around 1000-1250 cm⁻¹ which is not mentioned). Wait, no, wait: in esters, the C=O is around 1700, as mentioned. The OH peak would be at lower wavenumbers, but the broad peak here is around 3000, which is where O-H (like in an alcohol) would be. So the compound might have both an ester group and an alcohol group. But that would require three oxygens, which isn't the case here. Alternatively, maybe it's a hemiacetal or similar structure.

Alternatively, maybe the FTIR peak at 3000 is not an -OH but an =C-H stretch. Wait, no, the =C-H is usually around 3000-3100, but as a sharp peak. The broad peak suggests O-H. So perhaps the compound has an -OH group and a carbonyl group.

Wait, but the options don't have three oxygens. The options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. So for O counts: option C has two O's, which could be an ester (two O's in the ester group) and an -OH group. But that would require three O's, which isn't possible. So maybe the broad peak isn't an -OH but something else.

Hmm, maybe the broad peak is an -NH stretch? No, because the options don't have nitrogen. So perhaps it's an -OH group in a different context. Wait, another possibility: maybe the compound is a carboxylic acid. Then, the IR would have a broad O-H stretch around 3000 and a strong carbonyl around 1700. But the formula would need to have at least two O's. Let's see: a carboxylic acid would have formula CnH2nO2. For n=3, it's C3H6O2. But our options are for C6. So for C6H10O2, which is option C, that would fit a carboxylic acid with some unsaturation.

But wait, a carboxylic acid has formula RCOOH. So for C6H10O2, that would be RCOOH, where R is C5H9. But the molecular formula of RCOOH would be C6H12O2 (since R is C5H11, which is 12 H). Hmm, but our option C is C6H10O2. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted carboxylic acid with a double bond.

Wait, let me think: if it's a carboxylic acid, then the formula would be CnH2n-1COOH → Cn+1H2n+1O2. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me calculate.

A carboxylic acid has the formula CnH2nO2. For example, CH3COOH is C2H4O2. So, for a C6H10O2 acid, it would have to be C6H10O2, which would have the formula of a carboxylic acid with 5 carbons before the COOH group. Because:

For RCOOH, R is (C5H9). So RCOOH would be C6H12O2. But the option C is C6H10O2, which is two hydrogens less. So perhaps it's a di-substituted carboxylic acid with a double bond.

Ah, maybe it's a substituted carboxylic acid with a double bond, which would reduce the number of hydrogens. For example, CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH. Let me see the formula: C6H10O2. Perfect.

So the IR would have the broad O-H around 3000, the strong C=O at 1700, and perhaps a conjugated C=C at 1650. The NMR would show vinyl hydrogens (the CH2=CH group). The mass spec fragment at 45 could come from a part of the molecule, like the COOH group losing some parts. Or perhaps a fragment like CH2CH2O would be 44, but again, not 45.

Alternatively, in the mass spec, the fragment at 45 could be the (COOH-) group. Wait, but COOH is 44 (12+16*2 +1 = 44). So m/z=45 would be a fragment that includes another atom. Hmm, perhaps the methyl group attached to the COOH, making it (CH3COO-) which is 60. No, that's higher.

Wait, maybe the fragment is a ketene ion. A ketene has the structure RC=O, but I'm not sure about the exact mass. Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from the loss of a larger group. For example, the molecule could lose a propyl group (C3H7), which is 51, leaving a fragment of 63 (114-51=63). Not matching 45.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is due to the cleavage between the double bond and the COOH group. If the molecule is CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH, losing the CH2CH2COOH part (which is 72+32+1=105?), but that doesn't fit. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Let me think of another approach. The mass spectrum's fragment at 45 is a key clue. What are possible fragments with m/z=45.

45 in mass is:

- C3H7O: 3*12=36, 7=7, 16=16 → 36+7+16=59. No.

- C2H3O: 24 +3 +16 =43. No.

- C2H5O: 24 +5 +16=45. Oh! That's 45.

So a fragment with formula C2H5O would have a mass of 2*12 +5*1 +16 =24+5+16=45. So the fragment is C2H5O.

What structures give that? Maybe an ethylene oxide group, but that's a three-membered ring. Alternatively, a vinyl ether or a similar structure.

Wait, but in the context of the molecule, if the compound is an ester with a double bond, then perhaps a fragment could be a vinyl ether (like CH2=CH-O-) which would have a molecular weight of 44 (24+4+16=44). Not quite 45. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a methyl group attached to something. Wait, C2H5O's molecular weight is 45. So if the molecule has a CH2CH2O group (but that's C2H4O, which is 44), not 45. So perhaps the fragment is CH2CH2O plus a hydrogen, but that's not making sense.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment could be a ketene ion. A ketene has the formula R-C=O, and its molecular ion is around the mass of R-C=O. For example, if R is CH2CH2, then the ketene would be C3H4O, which is 3*12 +4 +16=52. Not 45.

Alternatively, if the fragment is a methyl vinyl ketone ion (like (CH3)C=O), but that's 56 (12*3 +16 +1*2= 36+16+2=54? Wait, not sure.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me see what the options are again.

Option C is C6H10O2. So, if the compound is a substituted acrylic acid ester, like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3 (but that's C6H10O2), which would have the ester carbonyl at 1700, the conjugated double bond at 1650, and the O-H from the ester? No, esters don't have O-H groups. Wait, but the FTIR shows a broad peak at 3000, which I thought was an O-H. But if it's an ester, where is the O-H? Oh, wait, maybe the O-H is from another group. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a beta-hydroxy ester. So, R-O-CO-R', where R' has a hydroxyl group. But that would require another O, making it three O's, which isn't the case here. So that can't be.

Alternatively, maybe the O-H is from a different functional group, like a phenol. But the formula doesn't have enough O's for that. Or perhaps it's an aldehyde, but I don't see how that would fit.

Wait, another angle: the FTIR broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ could be due to an amine (N-H stretch), but the options don't have N. So no, that's not it.

Alternatively, the broad peak could be due to an aromatic C-H stretch. But that's usually in the 3000-3100 region as a sharp peak, not a broad one. So perhaps not.

Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's summarize the clues:

1. FTIR: broad peak ~3000 (O-H?), strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 (carbonyl and maybe double bond).

2. ¹H NMR: vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond.

3. Mass spec: fragment at 45.

4. Possible formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O.

From the FTIR, the presence of O-H suggests either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But for the formula options, the O count is either 1 or 2.

Options with O=1: B (C6H10O) and D (C6H12O).

Options with O=2: A (C6H12O2) and C (C6H10O2).

If the compound has O-H, then it must have at least one O. So the options with O=1 (B and D) could be alcohols. Then, the 1700 cm⁻¹ would suggest a carbonyl group, but an alcohol doesn't have a carbonyl. So that's a problem. So the O-H would have to be from another group, but with only one O, that's not possible unless it's an aldehyde, which is less likely.

Wait, unless the compound is a ketone with an alcohol group. But that would require two O's, which again brings us to options with O=2.

So perhaps the O-H is from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol, but only if the formula allows.

So maybe the correct formula is C6H10O2 (option C), which has two O's. Then, the O-H could be from a hydroxyl group, but where is the other O? In an ester group, perhaps.

Wait, but if it's a diol or something else, but I'm not sure.

Another thought: the fragment m/z=45. Let me think about which options could lead to such a fragment.

The molecular weight of each option:

A) C6H12O2: 6*12=72 +12=84 +32=116 → 116.

C) C6H10O2: 72 +10=82 +32=114 → 114.

So the mass spec fragment is at 45, which is less than the molecular weight of all options except perhaps if the molecular weight is 45, which isn't the case.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is from a smaller molecule. For example, if the compound is an ester, the ester might break into the acid and the alcohol. The acid might have a molecular weight of 45. Wait, formic acid is 46 (HCOOH), acetic acid is 60. So 45 isn't matching any common acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from a ketone. For example, acetone is (CH3)2CO, which is 58. Not 45.

Hmm, maybe the fragment is a methyl group attached to something. Methyl is 15, but 45 is three times that. Alternatively, maybe it's a larger fragment.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a propyl group. C3H7 is 51. Not matching.

Another angle: if the molecular formula is C6H10O2, the possible fragments could include a (CH2)2O group, which is 44. Close to 45. Maybe with a small addition like a hydrogen.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a CH2=CH-O group. CH2=CH-O has a molecular weight of 44 (24 + 2 + 16=42; but including the double bond, maybe 44). Hmm, not 45.

I'm a bit stuck on the mass spec part, but let's think of the other clues. The IR with a broad peak and the presence of a carbonyl and a vinyl group. That points to a compound with both a carbonyl and a double bond. The NMR confirms the double bond.

So, perhaps the structure is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. These often show strong absorption around 1700 for the ester carbonyl and around 1650 for the conjugated double bond.

But wait, the IR also has a broad peak at 3000. If it's an ester, where would that peak come from? Esters don't have O-H groups. So perhaps the broad peak is not from an O-H. Another possibility is that it's from an aromatic ring's C-H stretch, but that's usually a sharper peak.

Wait, maybe the broad peak is from an amide, but the formula doesn't have N. Alternatively, perhaps it's a conjugated C=C system, but that doesn't explain the broadness.

Wait, another possibility: the broad peak could be from an alcohol that's not very acidic, like a secondary or tertiary alcohol. But then, the ester would have two O's, and the alcohol would add another O. So that would require three O's, which isn't the case here.

Hmm, perhaps the broad peak is from a different functional group. Maybe an ether? No, ethers don't have O-H.

Wait, maybe it's an aldehyde. The O-H stretch doesn't fit, but aldehydes have a strong peak around 2820 for the aldehyde C-H. But that's usually sharp, not broad.

Alternatively, perhaps the O-H is from a ketone enol tautomer, but I'm not sure.

I'm getting a bit stuck, but looking back at the options, option C is C6H10O2. That formula has two O's and a degree of unsaturation of 2. So it could be a ring and a double bond or two double bonds.

If it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, it would have one double bond (the conjugated one) and another double bond from the ester's carbonyl. So that's two double bonds, which fit the two degrees of unsaturation.

In that case, the NMR would show the vinyl protons, the IR would show the ester carbonyl and the conjugated double bond, and the broad peak at 3000 might be... wait, if it's an ester, where is the O-H? Hmm, this is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the broad peak is from something else, like a C-O stretch. But esters have C-O stretches around 1050-1250 cm⁻¹, which are sharp and not broad. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: the FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹, which could be an N-H stretch, but the formula doesn't include N. So that's out.

Alternatively, maybe it's a C-H stretch in a COOH group, but again, that would require a third O, which isn't present.

Hmm, maybe the compound isn't a simple ester. Perhaps it's a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond. For example, a six-membered ring with an ester linkage and a double bond. In that case, the structure would have one double bond (from the ring) and another from the ester or the double bond in the ring. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a diketone. But that would require two carbonyl groups, which would fit the IR peaks. But the formula C6H10O2 would have two carbonyls, which could be a diketone. But then, where is the O-H?

Wait, I'm going in circles. Let me try to make a decision based on the clues.

The presence of the O-H (broad peak), a carbonyl (1700), and a conjugated double bond (1650) suggests a structure like a carboxylic acid with a double bond. But the formula options don't have O's beyond two. So perhaps the O-H is from an alcohol group, and the carbonyl is from an ester. But that would require two O's, so the formula would be C6H10O2.

So, putting it all together:

FTIR:
- Broad ~3000: O-H (alcohol or carboxylic acid)
- 1700: ester or ketone
- 1650: conjugated double bond.

¹H NMR: vinyl hydrogens → double bond.

Mass spec: fragment at 45. Not entirely sure, but perhaps a smaller fragment like C2H5O.

So the formula is likely C6H10O2, which is option C.

The problem involves identifying the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on spectroscopic data: FTIR, ¹H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The analysis of the data is as follows:

### FTIR Analysis:
- A **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** suggests the presence of an O-H group, likely from an alcohol or carboxylic acid.
- A **strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹** indicates a carbonyl group (C=O), possibly from an ester or ketone.
- A **strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹** could correspond to a conjugated double bond or aromatic C=C stretching.

### ¹H NMR Analysis:
- The presence of peaks corresponding to **vinyl hydrogens** confirms the presence of a double bond in the compound.

### Mass Spectrometry:
- A **fragment peak at m/z = 45** suggests a smaller fragment with a molecular weight of 45. Possible candidates include fragments like C2H5O (45 g/mol).

### Formula Options:
1. **C6H12O2**:  
   - Degree of Unsaturation (DOU) = 1, which could correspond to a double bond or a ring.  
   - However, the FTIR data suggests two degrees of unsaturation (one from the carbonyl and one from the double bond), making this option unlikely.

2. **C6H10O**:  
   - DOU = 2, which could correspond to a double bond and a ring or two double bonds.  
   - However, this formula has only one oxygen, which cannot account for the broad O-H peak and the carbonyl group observed in the FTIR spectrum.

3. **C6H10O2**:  
   - DOU = 2, which could correspond to a double bond and a carbonyl group.  
   - This formula has two oxygens, consistent with the FTIR data (broad O-H and carbonyl peaks).  
   - The presence of vinyl hydrogens in the NMR and the conjugated double bond in the IR spectrum align well with this formula.  
   - The fragment at m/z = 45 could correspond to a smaller fragment like C2H5O, which is consistent with the molecular formula.

4. **C6H12O**:  
   - DOU = 1, which is insufficient to account for the double bond and carbonyl group observed in the FTIR spectrum.  
   - Additionally, this formula has only one oxygen, which cannot explain the broad O-H peak.

### Conclusion:
The spectroscopic data, including the FTIR peaks, the NMR evidence for vinyl hydrogens, and the mass spectrometry fragment at m/z = 45, are most consistent with the formula **C6H10O2**. This formula accounts for the observed functional groups and degrees of unsaturation.
