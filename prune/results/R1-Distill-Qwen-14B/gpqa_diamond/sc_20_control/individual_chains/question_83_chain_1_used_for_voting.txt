Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with titration calculations, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

We're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and the Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.

Hmm, let's break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I think I can handle this.

First, when you mix acetic acid with water, the concentration changes because the volume increases. So, the initial step is to calculate the new concentration after dilution. The formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2.

So, M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. The volume after adding water is 40 cm³. So,

M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2 = (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³ = (1) / 40? Wait, no, wait. 0.05 * 20 is 1, divided by 40 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, let me double-check that. 20 mL of 0.05 M: that's 20 * 0.05 = 1 mmol (since 1 M is 1 mol per liter, 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol, which is 1 mmol). Then adding 20 mL of water brings the total to 40 mL. So 1 mmol in 40 mL is (1 mmol)/(0.04 L) = 0.025 M. Yep, that's correct.

Next, I need to think about the titration. The acetic acid will react with NaOH. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O. So, the stoichiometry is 1:1.

Now, the initial moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution would be 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol (since 40 mL is 0.04 L). So, equivalence point occurs when we've added 0.001 mol of NaOH. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 mL. So, the equivalence point is when 10 mL of NaOH is added.

Now, the question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence.

First, let's handle 25% titration. 25% of 10 mL is 2.5 mL. So, 2.5 mL of NaOH is added. The moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

Since the reaction is 1:1, this will neutralize 0.00025 mol of acetic acid, converting it to acetate. So, the remaining acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. And we have 0.00025 mol of acetate.

But wait, the total volume at this point is initial solution (40 mL) plus 2.5 mL NaOH, so 42.5 mL. So, the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 L = 0.017647 M approximately.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.005882 M.

Now, since this is a buffer solution (a mixture of weak acid and its conjugate base), we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

pKa is -log(Ka). Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa is about 4.736.

So, pH = 4.736 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647). Let me compute that ratio first: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. Log(1/3) is roughly -0.477.

So, pH ≈ 4.736 - 0.477 ≈ 4.259, which is approximately 4.26.

Looking at the options, option A says 4.26 and 8.52. Option D is 4.57 and 6.92.

Wait, but let me check that calculation again. 0.00025 mol of acetate in 42.5 mL: 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M. Correct.

0.00075 mol acetic acid in 42.5 mL: 0.00075 / 0.0425 = approx 0.017647 M. Correct.

Ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. Log(1/3) is -0.477. Yes.

So pH is pKa + (-0.477) ≈ 4.736 - 0.477 = 4.259, which is about 4.26. So, option A has 4.26 as the first pH. Now, what about the equivalence point?

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form acetate ions. So, the solution is a solution of sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and strong base. It will hydrolyze in water to produce a basic solution.

The concentration of acetate can be calculated. At equivalence, we've added 10 mL of NaOH to 40 mL solution, so total volume is 50 mL (0.05 L). Moles of acetate are 0.001 mol.

Concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The hydrolysis reaction is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-. The Kb for acetate is Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14, Ka is 1.85e-5. So Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

Now, using the formula for weak base concentration:

OH- concentration is sqrt(Kb * C). So, sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

Then, pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH is 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have a pH around 9. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, the equivalence point pH is 9.02? Let me double-check.

Wait, Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (approximately) 5.405e-10.

Concentration of acetate is 0.02 M.

The hydrolysis equation is:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-].

Assuming x is [OH^-], then:

x² / (0.02 - x) ≈ x² / 0.02 = Kb.

So, x² = Kb * 0.02 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] is 1.04e-5, pOH is 4.98, pH is 14-4.98=9.02.

But looking at the options, the equivalence points are 8.52 (option A), 6.73 (B), 7 (C), 6.92 (D).

Hmm, none of them match 9. So perhaps I did something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in dilution steps. Let's go back.

Wait, when we diluted 20 mL of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 mL of water, the new concentration is 0.025 M, right? So the moles are 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. That's correct.

At equivalence, all moles of acetic acid are converted to acetate. So, moles of acetate = 0.001 mol.

Volume is 40 mL (original) + 10 mL NaOH = 50 mL. So concentration is 0.002 M? Wait, wait, wait. 0.001 mol / 0.05 L is 0.02 M. Oh, no, I said 0.02 M before. So that's correct.

Wait, maybe I messed up the Kb? Let me recalculate Kb.

Ka = 1.85e-5.

Kw = 1e-14 → Kb = Kw/Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = approximately 5.405e-10. That seems right.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the solution isn't 0.02 M. Let me check that.

At equivalence, total volume is 50 mL. Moles is 0.001 mol. So 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. Correct.

So the calculation seems correct. But none of the options have equivalence pH around 9. So that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the acetate ion is a weak base, but maybe I should use the formula for weak bases more accurately, not the approximation.

The exact equation is Kb = x² / (C - x) → 5.405e-10 = x² / (0.02 - x).

Assuming x is small compared to 0.02, we can approximate (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02 → x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ 1.04e-5. So the approximation holds, since 1.04e-5 is much less than 0.02.

So the OH- is about 1.04e-5, pOH ≈ 4.98, pH ≈ 9.02.

But none of the options have 9. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Looking at the options again:

Option A: 4.26; 8.52

Option D: 4.57; 6.92

Hmm. Did I make a mistake in the initial calculation of the equivalence point pH?

Wait, another possibility: maybe the acetate is treated as a base, but perhaps I should consider the solution more carefully. Alternatively, perhaps I did the initial dilution wrong.

Wait, initial acetic acid solution: 20 mL of 0.05 M. Moles = 20 * 0.05 * 0.001 (converting cm³ to liters) → 0.001 mol. Correct.

Wait, when you add 20 mL of water, the total volume is 40 mL. So the concentration becomes 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Correct.

So, when you reach equivalence, you've added 10 mL of 0.1 M NaOH. Moles NaOH = 0.1 * 0.01 = 0.001 mol. So, moles of acetate is 0.001, same as initial acetic acid. Correct.

So, the concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. Correct.

Wait, another approach: maybe the solution is not just acetate ion. Oh, but wait, the equivalence point is when all the acetic acid is converted to acetate. So sodium acetate is the only thing, which then hydrolyzes. So I think the calculation is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Kb. Let me recalculate Kb.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa ≈ 4.736.

Kb = Kw / Ka = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 → let me compute this.

1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 → approximately 0.5405 * 1e-9 → 5.405e-10. Yes, correct.

So, with Kb = 5.405e-10 and concentration 0.02 M:

The hydrolysis produces OH- concentration of sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) = 4.98 → pH = 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

But none of the options have that. So perhaps the question is not about the equivalence point's pH? Or maybe I'm miscalculating something else.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in considering the initial concentrations. Let me think again.

Wait, another way to calculate pH at equivalence: the concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. So, the pH can be found using the formula for a weak base:

pH = ½ (pKa + pKw - pKb) ? Wait, no, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps using the same Henderson equation but for the base.

Wait, no, Henderson-Hasselbalch isn't directly applicable here because it's a solution of the conjugate base. So, it's better to go through the Kb approach.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately without the approximation. Let me set up the equation without approximating.

So, Kb = 5.405e-10.

The equation is:

x² / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is small compared to 0.02, we can proceed with x² ≈ 5.405e-10 * 0.02 → 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

Same result as before. So, no change.

Hmm. So, perhaps the options are wrong or I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the pH at equivalence point differently. Wait, no, the approach seems correct. So, what's the problem here?

Let me look at the options again. Option A has pH at equivalence point as 8.52. How is that possible?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in initial moles of acetic acid.

Wait, initial volume after dilution is 40 mL. So 40 mL of 0.025 M. Moles = 0.04 L * 0.025 = 0.001 mol. Correct.

Wait, another thought: when you dilute 20 mL of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 mL water, the concentration is 0.025 M. Then, when you titrate, the moles of acid is 0.001, and the equivalence point is when you've added 0.001 mol of NaOH. NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume is 10 mL. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step and the equivalence point is 5 mL? No, no, 0.1 M NaOH, 0.001 mol is 10 mL.

Hmm. Another possibility: perhaps I should use the exact Ka and not approximate the pH. Let me try to find the pH at equivalence point another way.

Wait, the formula for a solution of a weak base: [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * C), but only if the solution is dilute and the approximation holds. But as we saw, the approximation holds because x is much smaller than 0.02.

Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately without approximation. Let's see:

Let me set up the equation:

x² = (5.405e-10)(0.02 - x).

Assume x is small, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. Then, x² = 1.081e-11 → x=1.04e-5.

So, [OH^-] is about 1.04e-5 → pOH is 4.98 → pH=9.02.

Wait, but maybe the concentration is higher than I thought. Wait, no, the acetate is 0.02 M.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution is 50 mL, and I made a mistake in the volume. But 0.02 M is correct.

Wait, perhaps the question asks for the pH at 25% of the initial volume, but that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps 25% of the initial concentration? No, I think I'm correct with 25% titration.

Wait, another thought: maybe the initial dilution wasn't 40 mL. Wait, wait, 20 cm³ acetic acid + 20 cm³ water makes 40 cm³. That's correct.

So, I'm back to the same conclusion. The equivalence point pH is around 9.02, but none of the options have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the first part.

Wait, looking at the options again, option D has pH at 25% titration as 4.57, and equivalence point is 6.92.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the 25% titration calculation. Let me recheck that.

Wait, at 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence volume is added. The equivalence volume is 10 mL, so 25% is 2.5 mL. So, moles NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

Which neutralizes 0.00025 mol of acetic acid, producing 0.00025 mol of acetate.

So, remaining acetic acid: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. So, the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 mol / (0.04 L + 0.0025 L) → 0.00075 / 0.0425 = approx 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Then, pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

pKa is around 4.736. The ratio [A^-]/[HA] is 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.333.

So log(1/3) is -0.477, so pH is 4.736 - 0.477 ≈4.259, which rounds to 4.26.

So, option A's first pH is 4.26, which matches. But the equivalence point pH isn't matching.

Wait, perhaps the question is about 25% of the initial solution's volume, but that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps I have a mistake in the calculation of the equivalence point.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution after mixing is 40 mL, but when you add 10 mL of NaOH, the total volume is 50 mL, but let me confirm the moles again.

Moles of NaOH added = 0.1 M * 0.01 L = 0.001 mol.

Moles of acetic acid initially 0.001 mol. So, all are neutralized, producing 0.001 mol of acetate.

Concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 L = 0.02 M. Correct.

Hmm. Perhaps the correct equivalence point pH is 9.02, but it's not among the options. So maybe I'm missing something in the problem setup.

Wait, wait a minute. Wait, the initial solution after dilution is 40 mL of 0.025 M acetic acid. Then, when you titrate with 0.1 M NaOH.

Wait, but perhaps I should calculate the pH after adding 25% of the initial acetic acid's moles.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Titration is by volume, not by moles. Wait, no, titration is based on moles. So, when you add 25% of the required NaOH to reach equivalence, that's 25% of the equivalence point.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the initial solution after dilution.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is about 25% of the titration based on the original 20 mL, not the diluted solution. Let me think: no, the solution being titrated is the diluted one, so the equivalence volume is 10 mL, as calculated.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Let me recheck that. The equation is pH = pKa + log ([A-]/[HA]). Correct.

Wait, [A-] is 0.005882 M and [HA] is 0.017647 M. So the log is log(0.333) = -0.477, correct.

So, pH is 4.736 - 0.477 = 4.259. So that's correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, only option A and D have the first pH around 4.26 or 4.57. So if the first part is correct, the equivalence point must be around 9, but options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the equivalence point. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the pH at equivalence point for a weak acid titrated with a strong base is determined by the hydrolysis of the conjugate base.

So, the pH is determined by the concentration of acetate ions. So, as before, 0.02 M. Kb=5.405e-10.

So, the [OH^-] is sqrt(Kb * C) = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) = approx 1.04e-5 M.

Thus, pOH is about 4.98, pH is 9.02.

Hmm. So, given that, none of the options have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles.

Wait, wait, perhaps I messed up the initial dilution. Let me recheck that.

Wait, initial solution: 20 mL of 0.05 M acetic acid diluted with 20 mL of water. So, moles of acetic acid = 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol, correct.

After dilution, total volume is 40 mL (0.04 L), so concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Correct.

So, equivalence point requires 0.001 mol NaOH, which is 10 mL of 0.1 M. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Kb or Ka.

Ka is given as 1.85e-5, so pKa is -log(1.85e-5) ≈ 4.736.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate pKa more accurately.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) → which is log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 5 - 0.267 = 4.733, which is about 4.73.

Hmm, perhaps the options are considering the pH at equivalence point as 7, but that's only for strong acid-strong base titrations. But for weak acid-strong base, it's higher than 7.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in dilution. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe after adding 20 mL of water, the total volume is 20 + 20 = 40 mL, and the moles of acetic acid are 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol, correct.

So, the concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M, correct.

Wait, another thought: maybe I should use the exact value for Kb and calculate more accurately.

Let me compute Kb again: 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = ?

1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 = approximately 0.5405e-9 = 5.405e-10. Correct.

So, Kb = 5.405e-10.

C = 0.02 M.

So, the expression for Kb is:

x²/(0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is small, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02, so x ≈ sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) = 1.04e-5.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) → let's compute log(1.04e-5).

Log(1.04) is about 0.017, so log(1.04e-5) is -5 + 0.017 = -4.983.

So pOH is 4.983 → pH is 14 - 4.983 = 9.017, approximately 9.02.

So, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the options have a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, the question says '25% titration'—does that refer to the volume of titrant added being 25% of the equivalence volume, or 25% of the initial solution's volume?

Wait, equivalence volume is 10 mL. 25% of that is 2.5 mL, which is what I used earlier.

Hmm. So perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I didn't account for the activity coefficients or something, but that's beyond the scope of this problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to 25% of the initial solution's volume, but that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the initial dilution didn't change the concentration as much as I thought.

Wait, but 20 mL of 0.05 M acetic acid → 1 mmol, then adding 20 mL gives 40 mL, so 0.025 M. Correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me think about the options again. Option D says pH at 25% is 4.57 and equivalence is 6.92.

Wait, 4.57 is lower than 4.26, which I calculated. So, perhaps I made a mistake there.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio of [A-]/[HA]. Let me recheck.

At 25% titration, the amount of NaOH added is 2.5 mL. Moles of NaOH: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

So, moles of acetic acid consumed: 0.00025 mol → remaining HA = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of acetate formed: 0.00025 mol.

Total volume is 40 mL + 2.5 mL = 42.5 mL → 0.0425 L.

So, [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[Acetate] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

So, the ratio is (0.005882) / (0.017647) ≈ 0.3333. Log(1/3) is -0.477.

So, pH = pKa + (-0.477) = 4.736 - 0.477 ≈4.259.

So, that's correct.

So, the only option with 4.26 as the first value is option A, which has equivalence at 8.52. But earlier calculation says 9.02. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it differently. Let me try to calculate the pH at equivalence point using the exact expression.

The solution is 0.02 M acetate ion. The Kb is 5.405e-10.

The expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-].

Let [OH^-] = x. Then,

x² / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is very small, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. So,

x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 → x² = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98 → pH=9.02.

Hmm. So, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, maybe the problem is that I used the diluted concentration correctly, but perhaps the initial calculation was wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the pH at equivalence point using the exact formula without the approximation.

Let me solve the equation without approximating.

x² = Kb * (0.02 - x).

So, x² + Kb x - 0.02 Kb = 0.

Substituting Kb =5.405e-10:

x² + (5.405e-10) x - (0.02 *5.405e-10) =0.

Using quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a).

Here, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant D = (5.405e-10)^2 +4 *1 * 1.081e-11 = (2.92e-19) + (4.324e-11) → approx 4.324e-11.

sqrt(D) ≈ 6.576e-6.

So, x = [ -5.405e-10 ± 6.576e-6 ] / 2.

We take the positive root: (6.576e-6 - 5.405e-10)/2 ≈ (6.576e-6)/2 ≈ 3.288e-6.

So, x ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

Wait, wait, that's different from the previous calculation. Oh wait, no, wait, I think I miscalculated the discriminant. Let me recalculate.

Wait, (5.405e-10)^2 = (5.405)^2 * (1e-10)^2 → 29.214 * 1e-20 → 2.9214e-19.

4ac = 4 *1*(-1.081e-11) → -4.324e-11.

Wait, wait, wait, the equation is x² + (5.405e-10)x - (0.02 *5.405e-10) =0.

So, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -0.02 *5.405e-10 = -1.081e-11.

So, discriminant D = b² -4ac = (5.405e-10)^2 -4*(1)*(-1.081e-11).

Wait, 4ac is 4*(1)*(-1.081e-11) = -4.324e-11, but in the discriminant, it's -4ac → +4.324e-11.

So, D = (2.9214e-19) + (4.324e-11) → 4.324e-11 is much larger than 2.92e-19, so D ≈4.324e-11.

sqrt(D) = sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈ 6.576e-6.

So, x = [ -5.405e-10 + 6.576e-6 ] / 2 → approximately (6.576e-6)/2 = 3.288e-6 M.

Wait, that's a much bigger [OH-] than before. So pOH is -log(3.288e-6) → log(3.288)=0.517 → so pOH=5.483.

Thus, pH=14-5.483=8.517. Oh! That's about 8.52, which matches option A's second value.

Wait, why did this happen? Because when I didn't make the approximation, the [OH-] is higher, leading to a lower pH.

Hmm, so perhaps the initial approximation was wrong because x isn't that small.

Wait, x is 3.288e-6 M. 0.02 M is 2e-2, so x is 3.288e-6, which is 0.003288% of 0.02. So, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 is a valid assumption. But why does the exact solution give a different x?

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Wait, if Kb is 5.405e-10 and C is 0.02 M, then the exact solution may not be necessary because x is so small. Wait, but according to the exact calculation, x is 3.288e-6 M, which is 3.288e-6, leading to a pOH of about 5.48, pH=8.52.

But when I assumed x is small, I got x≈1.04e-5 M, pOH=4.98, pH=9.02.

This is a big discrepancy. So which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exact calculation. Let me recheck.

Quadratic equation: x² + (5.405e-10) x - (1.081e-11) = 0.

x = [ -5.405e-10 ± sqrt( (5.405e-10)^2 +4 *1*1.081e-11 ) ] / 2.

Compute the sqrt part:

(5.405e-10)^2 = 2.921e-19.

4*1*1.081e-11 = 4.324e-11.

So, sqrt(2.921e-19 +4.324e-11) = sqrt(4.324e-11) = 6.576e-6.

So, x = [ -5.405e-10 + 6.576e-6 ] / 2 → 6.576e-6 is about 6.576e-6 M.

So, [OH^-]=6.576e-6 → pOH=5.186 → pH=8.814. Wait, that's not matching 8.52. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in calculation.

Wait, [OH^-] =6.576e-6 M.

pOH = -log(6.576e-6) → log(6.576) is about 0.817, so 6.576e-6 → pOH=5.183 → pH=8.817.

Wait, that's not matching the 8.52 in option A.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic formula. Let me recheck.

The quadratic is x² + (5.405e-10)x - (1.081e-11) = 0.

So, the solution is x = [ -b ± sqrt(b^2 +4ac) ] / 2a.

Wait, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

So, D = (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(1)*(1.081e-11) → 2.921e-19 +4.324e-11 → which is approximately 4.324e-11.

sqrt(D) = 6.576e-6.

Thus, x = [ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ] /2 → (6.576e-6 - 0.0000005405)/2 ≈ (6.576e-6)/2 = 3.288e-6.

So, [OH^-]=3.288e-6 → pOH=5.483 → pH=8.517, which is 8.52. That's option A's equivalence pH.

Wait, but earlier approximation gave pH=9.02. So, why the discrepancy?

Ah, I think I see the mistake. The initial approximation assumed that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02, which is valid only if x is much smaller than 0.02. In this case, x=3.288e-6, which is much smaller than 0.02, so the approximation holds, and the exact solution should be close to the approximation. But earlier, when I assumed x=1.04e-5, that was under the same approximation, but that gave a much higher [OH^-].

Wait, wait, what happened here. Let me recompute the approximation.

Using the approximation x² = Kb*C → x= sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) → sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5.

But that's higher than the exact solution x=3.288e-6. So, something is wrong.

Wait, perhaps in the quadratic solution, I missed a negative sign. Let me recompute.

Wait, the quadratic equation is x² + (5.405e-10)x - 1.081e-11 =0.

So, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

The solution is x = [-b ± sqrt(b² -4ac)]/(2a).

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the sign of the discriminant. It's b² -4ac.

So, D = (5.405e-10)^2 -4*(1)*(-1.081e-11) → (2.921e-19) + (4.324e-11) → 4.324e-11 + 2.921e-19 ≈ 4.324e-11.

So, sqrt(D) = 6.576e-6.

Thus, x = [ -5.405e-10 ±6.576e-6 ] / 2.

Taking the positive root: [6.576e-6 -5.405e-10 ] / 2 → approximately 6.576e-6 /2 = 3.288e-6.

So, [OH^-]=3.288e-6 → pOH=5.48 → pH=8.52.

Ah, so the correct pH at equivalence point is 8.52, which matches option A's second value. So, earlier mistake was in the approximation step, where I incorrectly used the same approach.

So, the initial approximation where we set (0.02 -x) ≈ 0.02 gave [OH-]=1.04e-5, which would lead to pH=9.02, which is not among the options. But using the exact quadratic solution, the pH is 8.52, which is option A.

Wait, but how come the exact solution gives a lower pH than the approximation? Because in the approximation, I assumed x² = Kb * C, leading to x=1.04e-5, but the exact solution shows x=3.288e-6, which is smaller. So, the approximation was incorrect, perhaps because the solution's x is not small enough for the approximation to hold?

Wait, but 3.288e-6 is much smaller than 0.02. So why is the approximation giving a much higher x?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approximation method. Let me re-express the Kb expression correctly.

Wait, the correct expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-].

But with [CH3COO^-] = 0.02 - x.

So, with x=3.288e-6, [CH3COO^-] = 0.02 - 3.288e-6 ≈ 0.019967 M. So, the approximation holds as (0.02 -x) ≈0.02.

But why does the approximation give a higher x?

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the initial approximation.

Wait, initial approximation: x² = Kb * C → x = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) = 1.04e-5.

But according to the exact solution, x is 3.288e-6, which is lower than the approximation.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula for the approximation. Let me think: the correct approximation is x² = Kb * C when (x << C), which it is in this case. So, why is there a discrepancy between the approximation and the exact solution?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Kb.

Oh! Wait a minute. I think I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me recheck Kb.

Ka =1.85e-5 → Kw=1e-14 → Kb=1e-14 /1.85e-5 → 1e-14 /1.85e-5 = (1/1.85) * 1e-9.

1/1.85 is approximately 0.5405. So, Kb=5.405e-10. Correct.

So, Kb*C=5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11.

x²=1.081e-11 → x=1.04e-5.

But in the exact solution, x=3.288e-6. So, why is there a difference?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic calculation. Let me recheck the quadratic solution.

Wait, the quadratic equation is x² + (5.405e-10) x - 1.081e-11 =0.

Using the quadratic formula:

x = [ -b ± sqrt(b² +4ac) ]/(2a).

Wait, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c=-1.081e-11.

So, D=b² -4ac = (5.405e-10)^2 -4*(1)*(-1.081e-11) → 2.921e-19 +4.324e-11 →4.324e-11.

sqrt(D)=6.576e-6.

So, x= [ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ] / 2 → (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 → approx 6.576e-6 /2 =3.288e-6.

Wait, that's correct. So, the correct [OH^-] is 3.288e-6, leading to pH=8.52.

So, why did the initial approximation using x²=Kb*C give a higher value? Because perhaps the approximation isn't valid when Kb*C is not much smaller than (C), but in this case, it's 1.081e-11, which is much smaller than 0.02.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the exact solution.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic approach. Let me try to substitute x=3.288e-6 into the Kb expression to see if it's correct.

[OH^-]=3.288e-6.

[CH3COOH]=x=3.288e-6.

[CH3COO^-]=0.02 - x ≈0.019967 M.

So, Kb = (3.288e-6 *3.288e-6)/0.019967 → (1.081e-11)/0.019967≈5.417e-10, which matches the given Kb of 5.405e-10. So, that's correct.

So, the correct pH at equivalence point is 8.52, which is option A's second value.

So, putting it all together.

At 25% titration, pH≈4.26.

At equivalence point, pH≈8.52.

So, the correct option is A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After diluting with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration is:

\[
\text{Concentration of acetic acid} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence point volume has been reached. The equivalence point requires 10.00 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH (calculated as:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.1 \, \text{M}} = 10.00 \, \text{cm³}.
\]

Thus, 25% of the equivalence point volume is:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH added} = 0.25 \times 10.00 \, \text{cm³} = 2.50 \, \text{cm³}.
\]

The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

This reacts with 0.00025 mol of acetic acid, leaving:

\[
\text{Remaining acetic acid} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume is now:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm³} + 2.50 \, \text{cm³} = 42.50 \, \text{cm³} = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} \right),
\]

where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.736\). Substituting the ratio:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.736 + \log \left( \frac{0.00588}{0.01765} \right) = 4.736 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.736 - 0.477 = 4.259.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.

---

### Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming acetate ions. The total moles of acetate are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetate} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm³} + 10.00 \, \text{cm³} = 50.00 \, \text{cm³} = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the base dissociation constant, \(K_b\), where:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Let the concentration of \(\text{OH}^-\) at equilibrium be \(x\). The equilibrium expression is:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] - x}.
\]

Assuming \(x \ll 0.02\), we approximate:

\[
K_b \approx \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Substituting \(K_b\):

\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot 0.02 = (5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02 = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.483.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.483 = 8.517.
\]

Thus, the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**.

---

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: A**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with titration calculations, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

We're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and the Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.

Hmm, let's break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I think I can handle this.

First, when you mix acetic acid with water, the concentration changes because the volume increases. So, the initial step is to calculate the new concentration after dilution. The formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2.

So, M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. The volume after adding water is 40 cm³. So,

M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2 = (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³ = (1) / 40? Wait, no, wait. 0.05 * 20 is 1, divided by 40 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, let me double-check that. 20 mL of 0.05 M: that's 20 * 0.05 = 1 mmol (since 1 M is 1 mol per liter, 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol, which is 1 mmol). Then adding 20 mL of water brings the total to 40 mL. So 1 mmol in 40 mL is (1 mmol)/(0.04 L) = 0.025 M. Yep, that's correct.

Next, I need to think about the titration. The acetic acid will react with NaOH. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O. So, the stoichiometry is 1:1.

Now, the initial moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution would be 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol (since 40 mL is 0.04 L). So, equivalence point occurs when we've added 0.001 mol of NaOH. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 mL. So, the equivalence point is when 10 mL of NaOH is added.

Now, the question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence.

First, let's handle 25% titration. 25% of 10 mL is 2.5 mL. So, 2.5 mL of NaOH is added. The moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

Since the reaction is 1:1, this will neutralize 0.00025 mol of acetic acid, converting it to acetate. So, the remaining acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. And we have 0.00025 mol of acetate.

But wait, the total volume at this point is initial solution (40 mL) plus 2.5 mL NaOH, so 42.5 mL. So, the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 L = 0.017647 M approximately.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.005882 M.

Now, since this is a buffer solution (a mixture of weak acid and its conjugate base), we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

pKa is -log(Ka). Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa is about 4.736.

So, pH = 4.736 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647). Let me compute that ratio first: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. Log(1/3) is roughly -0.477.

So, pH ≈ 4.736 - 0.477 ≈ 4.259, which is approximately 4.26.

Looking at the options, option A says 4.26 and 8.52. Option D is 4.57 and 6.92.

Wait, but let me check that calculation again. 0.00025 mol of acetate in 42.5 mL: 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M. Correct.

0.00075 mol acetic acid in 42.5 mL: 0.00075 / 0.0425 = approx 0.017647 M. Correct.

Ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. Log(1/3) is -0.477. Yes.

So pH is pKa + (-0.477) ≈ 4.736 - 0.477 = 4.259, which is about 4.26. So, option A has 4.26 as the first pH. Now, what about the equivalence point?

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form acetate ions. So, the solution is a solution of sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and strong base. It will hydrolyze in water to produce a basic solution.

The concentration of acetate can be calculated. At equivalence, we've added 10 mL of NaOH to 40 mL solution, so total volume is 50 mL (0.05 L). Moles of acetate are 0.001 mol.

Concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The hydrolysis reaction is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-. The Kb for acetate is Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14, Ka is 1.85e-5. So Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

Now, using the formula for weak base concentration:

OH- concentration is sqrt(Kb * C). So, sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

Then, pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH is 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have a pH around 9. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, the equivalence point pH is 9.02? Let me double-check.

Wait, Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (approximately) 5.405e-10.

Concentration of acetate is 0.02 M.

The hydrolysis equation is:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-].

Assuming x is [OH^-], then:

x² / (0.02 - x) ≈ x² / 0.02 = Kb.

So, x² = Kb * 0.02 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] is 1.04e-5, pOH is 4.98, pH is 14-4.98=9.02.

But looking at the options, the equivalence points are 8.52 (option A), 6.73 (B), 7 (C), 6.92 (D).

Hmm, none of them match 9. So perhaps I did something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in dilution steps. Let's go back.

Wait, when we diluted 20 mL of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 mL of water, the new concentration is 0.025 M, right? So the moles are 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. That's correct.

At equivalence, all moles of acetic acid are converted to acetate. So, moles of acetate = 0.001 mol.

Volume is 40 mL (original) + 10 mL NaOH = 50 mL. So concentration is 0.002 M? Wait, wait, wait. 0.001 mol / 0.05 L is 0.02 M. Oh, no, I said 0.02 M before. So that's correct.

Wait, maybe I messed up the Kb? Let me recalculate Kb.

Ka = 1.85e-5.

Kw = 1e-14 → Kb = Kw/Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = approximately 5.405e-10. That seems right.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the solution isn't 0.02 M. Let me check that.

At equivalence, total volume is 50 mL. Moles is 0.001 mol. So 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. Correct.

So the calculation seems correct. But none of the options have equivalence pH around 9. So that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the acetate ion is a weak base, but maybe I should use the formula for weak bases more accurately, not the approximation.

The exact equation is Kb = x² / (C - x) → 5.405e-10 = x² / (0.02 - x).

Assuming x is small compared to 0.02, we can approximate (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02 → x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ 1.04e-5. So the approximation holds, since 1.04e-5 is much less than 0.02.

So the OH- is about 1.04e-5, pOH ≈ 4.98, pH ≈ 9.02.

But none of the options have 9. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Looking at the options again:

Option A: 4.26; 8.52

Option D: 4.57; 6.92

Hmm. Did I make a mistake in the initial calculation of the equivalence point pH?

Wait, another possibility: maybe the acetate is treated as a base, but perhaps I should consider the solution more carefully. Alternatively, perhaps I did the initial dilution wrong.

Wait, initial acetic acid solution: 20 mL of 0.05 M. Moles = 20 * 0.05 * 0.001 (converting cm³ to liters) → 0.001 mol. Correct.

Wait, when you add 20 mL of water, the total volume is 40 mL. So the concentration becomes 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Correct.

So, when you reach equivalence, you've added 10 mL of 0.1 M NaOH. Moles NaOH = 0.1 * 0.01 = 0.001 mol. So, moles of acetate is 0.001, same as initial acetic acid. Correct.

So, the concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. Correct.

Wait, another approach: maybe the solution is not just acetate ion. Oh, but wait, the equivalence point is when all the acetic acid is converted to acetate. So sodium acetate is the only thing, which then hydrolyzes. So I think the calculation is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Kb. Let me recalculate Kb.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa ≈ 4.736.

Kb = Kw / Ka = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 → let me compute this.

1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 → approximately 0.5405 * 1e-9 → 5.405e-10. Yes, correct.

So, with Kb = 5.405e-10 and concentration 0.02 M:

The hydrolysis produces OH- concentration of sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) = 4.98 → pH = 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

But none of the options have that. So perhaps the question is not about the equivalence point's pH? Or maybe I'm miscalculating something else.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in considering the initial concentrations. Let me think again.

Wait, another way to calculate pH at equivalence: the concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. So, the pH can be found using the formula for a weak base:

pH = ½ (pKa + pKw - pKb) ? Wait, no, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps using the same Henderson equation but for the base.

Wait, no, Henderson-Hasselbalch isn't directly applicable here because it's a solution of the conjugate base. So, it's better to go through the Kb approach.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately without the approximation. Let me set up the equation without approximating.

So, Kb = 5.405e-10.

The equation is:

x² / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is small compared to 0.02, we can proceed with x² ≈ 5.405e-10 * 0.02 → 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

Same result as before. So, no change.

Hmm. So, perhaps the options are wrong or I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the pH at equivalence point differently. Wait, no, the approach seems correct. So, what's the problem here?

Let me look at the options again. Option A has pH at equivalence point as 8.52. How is that possible?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in initial moles of acetic acid.

Wait, initial volume after dilution is 40 mL. So 40 mL of 0.025 M. Moles = 0.04 L * 0.025 = 0.001 mol. Correct.

Wait, another thought: when you dilute 20 mL of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 mL water, the concentration is 0.025 M. Then, when you titrate, the moles of acid is 0.001, and the equivalence point is when you've added 0.001 mol of NaOH. NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume is 10 mL. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step and the equivalence point is 5 mL? No, no, 0.1 M NaOH, 0.001 mol is 10 mL.

Hmm. Another possibility: perhaps I should use the exact Ka and not approximate the pH. Let me try to find the pH at equivalence point another way.

Wait, the formula for a solution of a weak base: [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * C), but only if the solution is dilute and the approximation holds. But as we saw, the approximation holds because x is much smaller than 0.02.

Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately without approximation. Let's see:

Let me set up the equation:

x² = (5.405e-10)(0.02 - x).

Assume x is small, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. Then, x² = 1.081e-11 → x=1.04e-5.

So, [OH^-] is about 1.04e-5 → pOH is 4.98 → pH=9.02.

Wait, but maybe the concentration is higher than I thought. Wait, no, the acetate is 0.02 M.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution is 50 mL, and I made a mistake in the volume. But 0.02 M is correct.

Wait, perhaps the question asks for the pH at 25% of the initial volume, but that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps 25% of the initial concentration? No, I think I'm correct with 25% titration.

Wait, another thought: maybe the initial dilution wasn't 40 mL. Wait, wait, 20 cm³ acetic acid + 20 cm³ water makes 40 cm³. That's correct.

So, I'm back to the same conclusion. The equivalence point pH is around 9.02, but none of the options have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the first part.

Wait, looking at the options again, option D has pH at 25% titration as 4.57, and equivalence point is 6.92.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the 25% titration calculation. Let me recheck that.

Wait, at 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence volume is added. The equivalence volume is 10 mL, so 25% is 2.5 mL. So, moles NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

Which neutralizes 0.00025 mol of acetic acid, producing 0.00025 mol of acetate.

So, remaining acetic acid: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. So, the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 mol / (0.04 L + 0.0025 L) → 0.00075 / 0.0425 = approx 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Then, pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

pKa is around 4.736. The ratio [A^-]/[HA] is 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.333.

So log(1/3) is -0.477, so pH is 4.736 - 0.477 ≈4.259, which rounds to 4.26.

So, option A's first pH is 4.26, which matches. But the equivalence point pH isn't matching.

Wait, perhaps the question is about 25% of the initial solution's volume, but that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps I have a mistake in the calculation of the equivalence point.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution after mixing is 40 mL, but when you add 10 mL of NaOH, the total volume is 50 mL, but let me confirm the moles again.

Moles of NaOH added = 0.1 M * 0.01 L = 0.001 mol.

Moles of acetic acid initially 0.001 mol. So, all are neutralized, producing 0.001 mol of acetate.

Concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 L = 0.02 M. Correct.

Hmm. Perhaps the correct equivalence point pH is 9.02, but it's not among the options. So maybe I'm missing something in the problem setup.

Wait, wait a minute. Wait, the initial solution after dilution is 40 mL of 0.025 M acetic acid. Then, when you titrate with 0.1 M NaOH.

Wait, but perhaps I should calculate the pH after adding 25% of the initial acetic acid's moles.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Titration is by volume, not by moles. Wait, no, titration is based on moles. So, when you add 25% of the required NaOH to reach equivalence, that's 25% of the equivalence point.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the initial solution after dilution.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is about 25% of the titration based on the original 20 mL, not the diluted solution. Let me think: no, the solution being titrated is the diluted one, so the equivalence volume is 10 mL, as calculated.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Let me recheck that. The equation is pH = pKa + log ([A-]/[HA]). Correct.

Wait, [A-] is 0.005882 M and [HA] is 0.017647 M. So the log is log(0.333) = -0.477, correct.

So, pH is 4.736 - 0.477 = 4.259. So that's correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, only option A and D have the first pH around 4.26 or 4.57. So if the first part is correct, the equivalence point must be around 9, but options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the equivalence point. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the pH at equivalence point for a weak acid titrated with a strong base is determined by the hydrolysis of the conjugate base.

So, the pH is determined by the concentration of acetate ions. So, as before, 0.02 M. Kb=5.405e-10.

So, the [OH^-] is sqrt(Kb * C) = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) = approx 1.04e-5 M.

Thus, pOH is about 4.98, pH is 9.02.

Hmm. So, given that, none of the options have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles.

Wait, wait, perhaps I messed up the initial dilution. Let me recheck that.

Wait, initial solution: 20 mL of 0.05 M acetic acid diluted with 20 mL of water. So, moles of acetic acid = 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol, correct.

After dilution, total volume is 40 mL (0.04 L), so concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Correct.

So, equivalence point requires 0.001 mol NaOH, which is 10 mL of 0.1 M. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Kb or Ka.

Ka is given as 1.85e-5, so pKa is -log(1.85e-5) ≈ 4.736.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate pKa more accurately.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) → which is log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 5 - 0.267 = 4.733, which is about 4.73.

Hmm, perhaps the options are considering the pH at equivalence point as 7, but that's only for strong acid-strong base titrations. But for weak acid-strong base, it's higher than 7.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in dilution. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe after adding 20 mL of water, the total volume is 20 + 20 = 40 mL, and the moles of acetic acid are 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol, correct.

So, the concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M, correct.

Wait, another thought: maybe I should use the exact value for Kb and calculate more accurately.

Let me compute Kb again: 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = ?

1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 = approximately 0.5405e-9 = 5.405e-10. Correct.

So, Kb = 5.405e-10.

C = 0.02 M.

So, the expression for Kb is:

x²/(0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is small, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02, so x ≈ sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) = 1.04e-5.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) → let's compute log(1.04e-5).

Log(1.04) is about 0.017, so log(1.04e-5) is -5 + 0.017 = -4.983.

So pOH is 4.983 → pH is 14 - 4.983 = 9.017, approximately 9.02.

So, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the options have a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, the question says '25% titration'—does that refer to the volume of titrant added being 25% of the equivalence volume, or 25% of the initial solution's volume?

Wait, equivalence volume is 10 mL. 25% of that is 2.5 mL, which is what I used earlier.

Hmm. So perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I didn't account for the activity coefficients or something, but that's beyond the scope of this problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to 25% of the initial solution's volume, but that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the initial dilution didn't change the concentration as much as I thought.

Wait, but 20 mL of 0.05 M acetic acid → 1 mmol, then adding 20 mL gives 40 mL, so 0.025 M. Correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me think about the options again. Option D says pH at 25% is 4.57 and equivalence is 6.92.

Wait, 4.57 is lower than 4.26, which I calculated. So, perhaps I made a mistake there.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio of [A-]/[HA]. Let me recheck.

At 25% titration, the amount of NaOH added is 2.5 mL. Moles of NaOH: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

So, moles of acetic acid consumed: 0.00025 mol → remaining HA = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of acetate formed: 0.00025 mol.

Total volume is 40 mL + 2.5 mL = 42.5 mL → 0.0425 L.

So, [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[Acetate] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

So, the ratio is (0.005882) / (0.017647) ≈ 0.3333. Log(1/3) is -0.477.

So, pH = pKa + (-0.477) = 4.736 - 0.477 ≈4.259.

So, that's correct.

So, the only option with 4.26 as the first value is option A, which has equivalence at 8.52. But earlier calculation says 9.02. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it differently. Let me try to calculate the pH at equivalence point using the exact expression.

The solution is 0.02 M acetate ion. The Kb is 5.405e-10.

The expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-].

Let [OH^-] = x. Then,

x² / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is very small, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. So,

x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 → x² = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98 → pH=9.02.

Hmm. So, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, maybe the problem is that I used the diluted concentration correctly, but perhaps the initial calculation was wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the pH at equivalence point using the exact formula without the approximation.

Let me solve the equation without approximating.

x² = Kb * (0.02 - x).

So, x² + Kb x - 0.02 Kb = 0.

Substituting Kb =5.405e-10:

x² + (5.405e-10) x - (0.02 *5.405e-10) =0.

Using quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a).

Here, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant D = (5.405e-10)^2 +4 *1 * 1.081e-11 = (2.92e-19) + (4.324e-11) → approx 4.324e-11.

sqrt(D) ≈ 6.576e-6.

So, x = [ -5.405e-10 ± 6.576e-6 ] / 2.

We take the positive root: (6.576e-6 - 5.405e-10)/2 ≈ (6.576e-6)/2 ≈ 3.288e-6.

So, x ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

Wait, wait, that's different from the previous calculation. Oh wait, no, wait, I think I miscalculated the discriminant. Let me recalculate.

Wait, (5.405e-10)^2 = (5.405)^2 * (1e-10)^2 → 29.214 * 1e-20 → 2.9214e-19.

4ac = 4 *1*(-1.081e-11) → -4.324e-11.

Wait, wait, wait, the equation is x² + (5.405e-10)x - (0.02 *5.405e-10) =0.

So, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -0.02 *5.405e-10 = -1.081e-11.

So, discriminant D = b² -4ac = (5.405e-10)^2 -4*(1)*(-1.081e-11).

Wait, 4ac is 4*(1)*(-1.081e-11) = -4.324e-11, but in the discriminant, it's -4ac → +4.324e-11.

So, D = (2.9214e-19) + (4.324e-11) → 4.324e-11 is much larger than 2.92e-19, so D ≈4.324e-11.

sqrt(D) = sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈ 6.576e-6.

So, x = [ -5.405e-10 + 6.576e-6 ] / 2 → approximately (6.576e-6)/2 = 3.288e-6 M.

Wait, that's a much bigger [OH-] than before. So pOH is -log(3.288e-6) → log(3.288)=0.517 → so pOH=5.483.

Thus, pH=14-5.483=8.517. Oh! That's about 8.52, which matches option A's second value.

Wait, why did this happen? Because when I didn't make the approximation, the [OH-] is higher, leading to a lower pH.

Hmm, so perhaps the initial approximation was wrong because x isn't that small.

Wait, x is 3.288e-6 M. 0.02 M is 2e-2, so x is 3.288e-6, which is 0.003288% of 0.02. So, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 is a valid assumption. But why does the exact solution give a different x?

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Wait, if Kb is 5.405e-10 and C is 0.02 M, then the exact solution may not be necessary because x is so small. Wait, but according to the exact calculation, x is 3.288e-6 M, which is 3.288e-6, leading to a pOH of about 5.48, pH=8.52.

But when I assumed x is small, I got x≈1.04e-5 M, pOH=4.98, pH=9.02.

This is a big discrepancy. So which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exact calculation. Let me recheck.

Quadratic equation: x² + (5.405e-10) x - (1.081e-11) = 0.

x = [ -5.405e-10 ± sqrt( (5.405e-10)^2 +4 *1*1.081e-11 ) ] / 2.

Compute the sqrt part:

(5.405e-10)^2 = 2.921e-19.

4*1*1.081e-11 = 4.324e-11.

So, sqrt(2.921e-19 +4.324e-11) = sqrt(4.324e-11) = 6.576e-6.

So, x = [ -5.405e-10 + 6.576e-6 ] / 2 → 6.576e-6 is about 6.576e-6 M.

So, [OH^-]=6.576e-6 → pOH=5.186 → pH=8.814. Wait, that's not matching 8.52. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in calculation.

Wait, [OH^-] =6.576e-6 M.

pOH = -log(6.576e-6) → log(6.576) is about 0.817, so 6.576e-6 → pOH=5.183 → pH=8.817.

Wait, that's not matching the 8.52 in option A.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic formula. Let me recheck.

The quadratic is x² + (5.405e-10)x - (1.081e-11) = 0.

So, the solution is x = [ -b ± sqrt(b^2 +4ac) ] / 2a.

Wait, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

So, D = (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(1)*(1.081e-11) → 2.921e-19 +4.324e-11 → which is approximately 4.324e-11.

sqrt(D) = 6.576e-6.

Thus, x = [ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ] /2 → (6.576e-6 - 0.0000005405)/2 ≈ (6.576e-6)/2 = 3.288e-6.

So, [OH^-]=3.288e-6 → pOH=5.483 → pH=8.517, which is 8.52. That's option A's equivalence pH.

Wait, but earlier approximation gave pH=9.02. So, why the discrepancy?

Ah, I think I see the mistake. The initial approximation assumed that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02, which is valid only if x is much smaller than 0.02. In this case, x=3.288e-6, which is much smaller than 0.02, so the approximation holds, and the exact solution should be close to the approximation. But earlier, when I assumed x=1.04e-5, that was under the same approximation, but that gave a much higher [OH^-].

Wait, wait, what happened here. Let me recompute the approximation.

Using the approximation x² = Kb*C → x= sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) → sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5.

But that's higher than the exact solution x=3.288e-6. So, something is wrong.

Wait, perhaps in the quadratic solution, I missed a negative sign. Let me recompute.

Wait, the quadratic equation is x² + (5.405e-10)x - 1.081e-11 =0.

So, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

The solution is x = [-b ± sqrt(b² -4ac)]/(2a).

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the sign of the discriminant. It's b² -4ac.

So, D = (5.405e-10)^2 -4*(1)*(-1.081e-11) → (2.921e-19) + (4.324e-11) → 4.324e-11 + 2.921e-19 ≈ 4.324e-11.

So, sqrt(D) = 6.576e-6.

Thus, x = [ -5.405e-10 ±6.576e-6 ] / 2.

Taking the positive root: [6.576e-6 -5.405e-10 ] / 2 → approximately 6.576e-6 /2 = 3.288e-6.

So, [OH^-]=3.288e-6 → pOH=5.48 → pH=8.52.

Ah, so the correct pH at equivalence point is 8.52, which matches option A's second value. So, earlier mistake was in the approximation step, where I incorrectly used the same approach.

So, the initial approximation where we set (0.02 -x) ≈ 0.02 gave [OH-]=1.04e-5, which would lead to pH=9.02, which is not among the options. But using the exact quadratic solution, the pH is 8.52, which is option A.

Wait, but how come the exact solution gives a lower pH than the approximation? Because in the approximation, I assumed x² = Kb * C, leading to x=1.04e-5, but the exact solution shows x=3.288e-6, which is smaller. So, the approximation was incorrect, perhaps because the solution's x is not small enough for the approximation to hold?

Wait, but 3.288e-6 is much smaller than 0.02. So why is the approximation giving a much higher x?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approximation method. Let me re-express the Kb expression correctly.

Wait, the correct expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-].

But with [CH3COO^-] = 0.02 - x.

So, with x=3.288e-6, [CH3COO^-] = 0.02 - 3.288e-6 ≈ 0.019967 M. So, the approximation holds as (0.02 -x) ≈0.02.

But why does the approximation give a higher x?

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the initial approximation.

Wait, initial approximation: x² = Kb * C → x = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) = 1.04e-5.

But according to the exact solution, x is 3.288e-6, which is lower than the approximation.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula for the approximation. Let me think: the correct approximation is x² = Kb * C when (x << C), which it is in this case. So, why is there a discrepancy between the approximation and the exact solution?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Kb.

Oh! Wait a minute. I think I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me recheck Kb.

Ka =1.85e-5 → Kw=1e-14 → Kb=1e-14 /1.85e-5 → 1e-14 /1.85e-5 = (1/1.85) * 1e-9.

1/1.85 is approximately 0.5405. So, Kb=5.405e-10. Correct.

So, Kb*C=5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11.

x²=1.081e-11 → x=1.04e-5.

But in the exact solution, x=3.288e-6. So, why is there a difference?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic calculation. Let me recheck the quadratic solution.

Wait, the quadratic equation is x² + (5.405e-10) x - 1.081e-11 =0.

Using the quadratic formula:

x = [ -b ± sqrt(b² +4ac) ]/(2a).

Wait, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c=-1.081e-11.

So, D=b² -4ac = (5.405e-10)^2 -4*(1)*(-1.081e-11) → 2.921e-19 +4.324e-11 →4.324e-11.

sqrt(D)=6.576e-6.

So, x= [ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ] / 2 → (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 → approx 6.576e-6 /2 =3.288e-6.

Wait, that's correct. So, the correct [OH^-] is 3.288e-6, leading to pH=8.52.

So, why did the initial approximation using x²=Kb*C give a higher value? Because perhaps the approximation isn't valid when Kb*C is not much smaller than (C), but in this case, it's 1.081e-11, which is much smaller than 0.02.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the exact solution.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic approach. Let me try to substitute x=3.288e-6 into the Kb expression to see if it's correct.

[OH^-]=3.288e-6.

[CH3COOH]=x=3.288e-6.

[CH3COO^-]=0.02 - x ≈0.019967 M.

So, Kb = (3.288e-6 *3.288e-6)/0.019967 → (1.081e-11)/0.019967≈5.417e-10, which matches the given Kb of 5.405e-10. So, that's correct.

So, the correct pH at equivalence point is 8.52, which is option A's second value.

So, putting it all together.

At 25% titration, pH≈4.26.

At equivalence point, pH≈8.52.

So, the correct option is A.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After diluting with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration is:

\[
\text{Concentration of acetic acid} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence point volume has been reached. The equivalence point requires 10.00 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH (calculated as:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.1 \, \text{M}} = 10.00 \, \text{cm³}.
\]

Thus, 25% of the equivalence point volume is:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH added} = 0.25 \times 10.00 \, \text{cm³} = 2.50 \, \text{cm³}.
\]

The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

This reacts with 0.00025 mol of acetic acid, leaving:

\[
\text{Remaining acetic acid} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume is now:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm³} + 2.50 \, \text{cm³} = 42.50 \, \text{cm³} = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} \right),
\]

where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.736\). Substituting the ratio:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.736 + \log \left( \frac{0.00588}{0.01765} \right) = 4.736 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.736 - 0.477 = 4.259.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.

### Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming acetate ions. The total moles of acetate are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetate} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm³} + 10.00 \, \text{cm³} = 50.00 \, \text{cm³} = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the base dissociation constant, \(K_b\), where:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Let the concentration of \(\text{OH}^-\) at equilibrium be \(x\). The equilibrium expression is:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] - x}.
\]

Assuming \(x \ll 0.02\), we approximate:

\[
K_b \approx \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Substituting \(K_b\):

\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot 0.02 = (5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02 = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.483.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.483 = 8.517.
\]

Thus, the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**.
