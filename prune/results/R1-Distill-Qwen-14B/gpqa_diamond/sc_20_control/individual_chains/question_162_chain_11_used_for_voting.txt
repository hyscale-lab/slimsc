Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit familiar. I remember that in general relativity, metrics can describe different kinds of spacetimes, but here it's a two-dimensional metric, right? Because the line element only involves dx² and dy², so it's a 2D surface embedded in some space, possibly a higher-dimensional one.

Wait, the question mentions a pseudosphere. Oh right! A pseudosphere is a two-dimensional surface with constant negative curvature. In other words, its Gaussian curvature is negative everywhere. The metric given must be that of a pseudosphere.

I recall that the metric for a pseudosphere (or hyperbolic space) can be written in various forms. One common representation is in isothermal coordinates, which might look something like ds² = (2a²/(a² - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²), but that's for polar coordinates. Alternatively, for Cartesian coordinates, maybe it's expressed differently.

Wait, in the given metric, the denominator is (4 - x² - y²). So 4 is like the square of the radius, which in this case is 2, since r=2. So that makes sense. The denominator would then be 4 - (x² + y²). So the metric is ds² = (32)/(4 - (x² + y²)) (dx² + dy²).

I think when x² + y² approaches 4, the metric blows up, which suggests that the boundary of this surface is at x² + y² = 4. So the surface is a pseudosphere with radius 2, which is the value of r given.

Now, the question is about the area of this pseudosphere. Wait, wait, pseudospheres are non-compact, right? Because as you go towards the edge (x² + y² approaching 4), the geometry becomes infinitely curved. So the area might be infinite.

Wait, but let's think about it more precisely. The area in a 2D metric is found by integrating the area element over the surface. The area element dA is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. Since it's 2D and in the form ds² = E dx² + E dy² (since the coefficients for dx² and dy² are the same), the metric tensor components are E for both g_{xx} and g_{yy}, and zero elsewhere. So the determinant g is E² - 0 = E². But since E is (32)/(4 - x² - y²), the area element becomes sqrt(E²) dx dy = E dx dy.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the square root of the determinant would be sqrt(g_{xx} g_{yy} - g_{xy}^2). Since g_{xy} is zero, it's sqrt(g_{xx} g_{yy}) = sqrt(E²) = E, because E is positive. So the area element is E dx dy.

So the area would be the double integral over the region where 4 - x² - y² is positive, i.e., where x² + y² <4. So the integration is over the disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane.

So the area A is the integral over x² + y² <4 of (32)/(4 - (x² + y²)) dx dy.

Hmm, change to polar coordinates for easier integration. Let x = r cosθ, y= r sinθ. Then dx dy becomes r dr dθ. The integral becomes:

A = ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (from r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ

So the integral is 32 * ∫ (0 to 2π) dθ ∫ (0 to 2) [r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Compute the radial integral first. Let me do the substitution u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr.

So when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0. So the integral becomes:

∫ (from u=4 to u=0) [1/u] * (-du/2 )

Which is (1/2) ∫ (from 4 to 0) 1/u du. That's (1/2) [ln u] from 4 to 0. Wait, ln 0 is negative infinity. Hmm, but when r approaches 2, u approaches 0 from above, so the integral from 0 to 2 would be:

Wait, let me double-check the substitution. When r goes from 0 to 2, u goes from 4 to 0. So the integral ∫ (0→2) [r/(4 - r²)] dr becomes ∫ (4→0) (1/u) (-du/2) → (1/2) ∫ (0→4) (1/u) du. Because flipping the limits removes the negative sign.

Ah, right! So ∫ (0→4) (1/u) du is ln u from 0 to 4. But wait, as u approaches 0 from above, ln u approaches negative infinity. So this integral diverges to negative infinity? Wait, that can't be right, because the area can't be negative. Hmm, perhaps I made a substitution mistake.

Wait, wait, our substitution was u=4 - r². When r approaches 2, u approaches 0. So the integral in terms of u is from u=4 (when r=0) to u=0 (when r=2). So the integral becomes ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr = ∫ [ -1/(2u) ] du evaluated from 4 to 0. So that's ( -1/2 ) ∫ (4 →0) (1/u) du. So that becomes ( -1/2 ) [ ln u ] from 4 to 0 → ( -1/2 ) ( ln 0 - ln4 ) → ( -1/2 ) ( -∞ - ln4 ) → ( -1/2 ) (-∞) → which is positive infinity. So the radial integral is infinite.

Therefore, the area A is 32 * (2π) * ∞ → which is infinite.

Wait, but wait. The question says the pseudosphere has radius r=2. What's the area of a pseudosphere? I thought that hyperbolic space has infinite volume, but perhaps in 2D, the area is also infinite.

Alternatively, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think about the standard pseudosphere (like the tractricoid). Its surface area is finite. Wait, no, maybe not. Wait, no, I think the tractricoid is a finite surface, but it's a surface of revolution of a curve with infinite length. Wait, but in this case, the metric might represent a different kind of pseudosphere.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the models. The metric given here is similar to the Poincaré disk model of hyperbolic space. The Poincaré disk model has a finite radius, but the area is infinite because each point in the disk has an infinitely extending hyperbolic plane around it.

Wait, in the Poincaré disk model, the area of the entire hyperbolic plane is infinite. So the area of this pseudosphere, which is modeled by this metric, should be infinite.

So the answer is D) +infty.

The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\). To determine the area of the pseudosphere, we calculate the area element \(dA\) for this metric. In general, the area element is given by \(dA = \sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy\), where \(g\) is the determinant of the metric tensor. For this metric, the determinant of the metric tensor is \((32/(4 - x^2 - y^2))^2\), so the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

The area of the pseudosphere is then obtained by integrating \(dA\) over the region where the metric is defined, i.e., \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\). Switching to polar coordinates \(x = r \cos\theta\), \(y = r \sin\theta\), the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The area \(A\) is then:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

First, evaluate the radial integral:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 \cdot r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_4^0 \frac{-32}{2u} \, du = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \(\int \frac{1}{u} \, du\) diverges as \(u \to 0\), leading to an infinite result. Since the radial integral diverges, the total area \(A\) is infinite. This reflects the fact that the pseudosphere, modeled by this metric, is a non-compact surface with infinite area.

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere is \(+\infty\).
