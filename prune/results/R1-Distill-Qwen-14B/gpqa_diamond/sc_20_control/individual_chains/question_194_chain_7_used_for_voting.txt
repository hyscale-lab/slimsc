Okay, so I've got this problem about spins and partition functions. Hmm, let's see. The question involves three spins, S1, S2, and S3, each can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E= -J[ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ]. I need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, the partition function is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). So each state contributes exp(-βE) to Z.

But first, I should figure out all possible states and compute E for each, then sum the exponentials.

Each spin has two options, so for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. Let me list them.

Each state is a triplet (S1, S2, S3). Possible values for each are +1 or -1.

Let me list them:

1. (+1, +1, +1)
2. (+1, +1, -1)
3. (+1, -1, +1)
4. (+1, -1, -1)
5. (-1, +1, +1)
6. (-1, +1, -1)
7. (-1, -1, +1)
8. (-1, -1, -1)

Now, for each state, calculate E.

E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]

Let's compute each term:

1. State 1: all +1.
E = -J [ (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) ] = -J*(3) = -3J.

2. State 2: S3 is -1.
S1S2 =1, S1S3= -1, S2S3= -1. Sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. E = -J*(-1)= J.

3. State 3: S2 is -1.
S1S2= -1, S1S3=1, S2S3= -1. Sum: -1 +1 -1= -1. E= J.

4. State 4: S2 and S3 are -1.
S1S2= -1, S1S3= -1, S2S3=1. Sum: -1-1+1= -1. E= J.

5. State 5: S1 is -1.
S1S2= (-1)(1)= -1, S1S3= (-1)(1)=-1, S2S3=1. Sum: -1-1+1=-1. E= J.

6. State6: S1=-1, S3=-1.
S1S2= (−1)(1)=−1, S1S3= (−1)(−1)=1, S2S3= (1)(−1)=−1. Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1. E= J.

7. State7: S1=-1, S2=-1.
S1S2= (−1)(−1)=1, S1S3= (−1)(1)=−1, S2S3= (−1)(1)=−1. Sum: 1−1−1=−1. E= J.

8. State8: all -1.
S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum is 3. E= -3J.

Wait, wait a second. Let me double-check each state.

Wait State2: S1=1, S2=1, S3=-1.

S1S2=1*1=1.

S1S3=1*(-1)=-1.

S2S3=1*(-1)=-1.

Sum: 1 -1 -1= -1. So E= -J*(-1)= J.

Similarly:

State3: S1=1, S2=-1, S3=1.

S1S2= -1.

S1S3= 1.

S2S3= (-1)(1)= -1.

Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1. E= J.

Wait, but for State4: S1=1, S2=-1, S3=-1.

S1S2= -1.

S1S3= -1.

S2S3= (-1)*(-1)=1.

Sum: -1-1+1= -1. E= J.

Hmm, same as before.

Wait, what about State5: S1=-1, S2=1, S3=1.

S1S2= (-1)(1)=-1.

S1S3= (-1)(1)=-1.

S2S3=1.

Sum: -1-1+1= -1. E=J.

Same pattern.

State6: S1=-1, S2=1, S3=-1.

S1S2= -1.

S1S3= 1.

S2S3= -1.

Sum: -1+1-1 = -1. E= J.

State7: S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=1.

S1S2=1.

S1S3=-1.

S2S3= -1.

Sum:1 -1 -1= -1. E= J.

State8: all -1.

S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum 3. E= -3J.

Wait, so States 1 and 8 have E=-3J, which is the minimum energy.

States 2-7 are E= J each.

So how many states have E=-3J? Only two: (1) all +1, (8) all -1.

And the other six states (2-7) each have E= J.

So the partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp(-β E).

So for each state, the term is exp(-β E).

So for the two states with E=-3J, the term is exp(-β*(-3J)) = exp(3β J).

And for the six states with E= J, the term is exp(-β * J).

So Z = 2 * exp(3 β J) + 6 * exp(- β J).

Wait wait, wait a second.

Wait, in the exponent, it's exp(-β E). So for E = -3J, it's exp(-β*(-3J))= exp(3β J).

For E = J, it's exp(-β* J).

So Z = 2 exp(3β J) + 6 exp(-β J).

Looking at the options:

Option A: 2 e^(-3Jβ) +6 e^(Jβ) → No.

Option B: 2 e^{3 J β} +6 e^{-J β} → Yes.

Option C: 2 e^{2βJ} +6 e^{-2βJ} → No.

Option D: 6 e^{2βJ} + 2 e^{-2βJ} → No.

So the correct option would be B: Z= 2e^{3Jβ}+6e^{-Jβ}.

Wait, but wait—did I compute the states correctly? Let me recount.

Number of states with E=-3J: 2 (all +1s, all -1s).

Number of states with E= J: 6? Because 8-2=6.

Yes, because 3 spins, each can be + or -, so 8 states. Two have all same, others have two same and one different, or all different? Wait, no. Wait the states 2-7: each has exactly two +1 and one -1, or other combinations. Alternatively, let me think: for each state, the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can be -1 or 3, but in our calculation, the sum is -1 for 6 states and 3 for 2.

Wait no, in our earlier calculation, when all are same, sum is 3. When there's an even number of -1's? Wait, for three spins, it's either 0, 2, or all 3.

Wait: for three spins, the number of -1s can be 0, 1, 2,3.

Wait, for three spins, when all are +1, sum is 3.

When one is -1 and others +1, let's see:

For state2: one -1 (S3=-1), sum is 1*(-1) + ... etc.

Wait, perhaps the sum can take different values. Wait, let me think of another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can be expressed in terms of the number of +1 and -1 spins.

Wait, let me see:

Each term S_i S_j is 1 if S_i and S_j are the same, -1 if opposite.

So sum = number of pairs where S_i and S_j are same (each contributes 1) minus number of pairs where they are different (each contributes -1).

Total pairs: C(3,2)=3.

So sum = (N_same - N_diff) = (N_same) - (3 - N_same) ) = 2*N_same -3.

So sum can be 2*N_same -3.

Since N_same can be 0,1,2,3.

If all spins same (N_same=3):

sum=6-3=3 → E= -3J.

If two spins same, one different (N_same=2):

sum=4-3=1 → E = -J*(1) = -J ?

Wait, no. Wait the initial E is -J*(sum), so E = -J*(sum).

Wait, wait, in state2, the sum is -1, so E= J.

Wait in our earlier approach, when N_same is 2, the sum is 1, so E = -J*(1) = -J. But in our earlier calculation, when one spin is different, the sum was -1, leading to E= J.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me double-check this approach.

Wait, if N_same is the number of pairs that are the same.

Wait, for three spins, when two are same and one different.

Wait, for example, S1=1, S2=1, S3=-1.

Pairs: S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. So sum is 1-1-1= -1.

So sum = -1.

Which is 2*N_same -3.

So 2*2 -3=1. Wait no, that gives 1, but the sum was -1. So that formula must be wrong.

Hmm, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Let me rederive.

Each term S_i S_j is 1 if same, -1 if different.

So sum of the three terms is (number of same pairs) *1 + (number of different pairs)* (-1).

So sum = (N_same) - (3 - N_same) )= 2 N_same -3.

But in state2, N_same=1.

Because S1 and S2 are same, S1 and S3 different, S2 and S3 different.

So N_same=1.

So sum= 2(1) -3= -1.

Which matches.

So when N_same=1, sum= -1 → E= J.

When N_same=2, meaning two pairs are same.

Wait, for example:

S1=1, S2=1, S3=1 → N_same=3, sum=3.

But another case: S1=1, S2=1, S3=-1. N_same is 1, sum=-1.

Wait, isn't there a case where N_same is 2?

Wait, for three spins, how can two pairs be same? Let's see:

If all three are same, then N_same=3.

But if two are same and the third different, how many same pairs?

For example, S1=1, S2=1, S3=-1.

Pairs: (1,1)= same, (1,-1)= different, (1,-1)= different. So only one same pair.

So N_same=1.

Wait, perhaps it's impossible for N_same to be 2.

Wait, because for three variables, each pair is of two variables. If two variables are same, the third is different, then only one pair is same.

Wait, perhaps N_same can be 0,1,3.

Wait, let's think: can N_same=2?

Only if two different pairs are same. How?

Wait, no. Because if two pairs are same, the third pair must also be same.

Wait, for example: if S1=S2, and S1=S3, then S2=S3. So all three are same. So N_same=3.

Similarly, if S1=S2, and S2=S3, then S1=S3, so N_same=3.

So the only possible N_same are 0,1,3.

Wait, N_same=0: all pairs are different. Is that possible?

Only if all three spins are different. But each spin is either +1 or -1. So for three spins, with two possible values, it's impossible for all three to be different. So N_same can't be 0.

So for three spins, N_same can be 1 or 3.

So, when N_same=3, sum=3 → E= -3 J.

When N_same=1, sum=2(1)-3= -1 → E= J.

So in the 8 states, only two have N_same=3 (all same), and the other six have N_same=1, thus E=J.

Hence, the partition function is Z= 2 e^{3 J β} +6 e^{-J β}.

Which matches option B: Z=2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ}.

To solve the problem, we consider a system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), each of which can take the values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \). The energy of the system is given by:

\[
E = -J \left( S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3 \right).
\]

The partition function \( Z \) is defined as the sum over all possible states of \( \exp(-\beta E) \), where \( \beta = 1/(kT) \). Since there are \( 2^3 = 8 \) possible states, we enumerate them and calculate \( E \) for each state.

### Step 1: Enumerate all states and calculate \( E \)
1. **State 1**: \( (+1, +1, +1) \)  
   \( S_1 S_2 = 1, S_1 S_3 = 1, S_2 S_3 = 1 \), so \( E = -J(1 + 1 + 1) = -3J \).

2. **State 2**: \( (+1, +1, -1) \)  
   \( S_1 S_2 = 1, S_1 S_3 = -1, S_2 S_3 = -1 \), so \( E = -J(1 - 1 - 1) = J \).

3. **State 3**: \( (+1, -1, +1) \)  
   \( S_1 S_2 = -1, S_1 S_3 = 1, S_2 S_3 = -1 \), so \( E = -J(-1 + 1 - 1) = J \).

4. **State 4**: \( (+1, -1, -1) \)  
   \( S_1 S_2 = -1, S_1 S_3 = -1, S_2 S_3 = 1 \), so \( E = -J(-1 - 1 + 1) = J \).

5. **State 5**: \( (-1, +1, +1) \)  
   \( S_1 S_2 = -1, S_1 S_3 = -1, S_2 S_3 = 1 \), so \( E = -J(-1 - 1 + 1) = J \).

6. **State 6**: \( (-1, +1, -1) \)  
   \( S_1 S_2 = -1, S_1 S_3 = 1, S_2 S_3 = -1 \), so \( E = -J(-1 + 1 - 1) = J \).

7. **State 7**: \( (-1, -1, +1) \)  
   \( S_1 S_2 = 1, S_1 S_3 = -1, S_2 S_3 = -1 \), so \( E = -J(1 - 1 - 1) = J \).

8. **State 8**: \( (-1, -1, -1) \)  
   \( S_1 S_2 = 1, S_1 S_3 = 1, S_2 S_3 = 1 \), so \( E = -J(1 + 1 + 1) = -3J \).

### Step 2: Classify states based on energy
- **States 1 and 8**: \( E = -3J \) (2 states).
- **States 2–7**: \( E = J \) (6 states).

### Step 3: Compute the partition function
The partition function is:

\[
Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} \exp(-\beta E).
\]

For the two states with \( E = -3J \), the contribution is:

\[
2 \exp(-\beta (-3J)) = 2 \exp(3\beta J).
\]

For the six states with \( E = J \), the contribution is:

\[
6 \exp(-\beta J).
\]

Thus, the partition function is:

\[
Z = 2 \exp(3\beta J) + 6 \exp(-\beta J).
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
From the options provided:
- **Option A**: \( Z = 2 \exp(-3J\beta) + 6 \exp(J\beta) \) (incorrect).
- **Option B**: \( Z = 2 \exp(3J\beta) + 6 \exp(-J\beta) \) (correct).
- **Option C**: \( Z = 2 \exp(2J\beta) + 6 \exp(-2J\beta) \) (incorrect).
- **Option D**: \( Z = 6 \exp(2J\beta) + 2 \exp(-2J\beta) \) (incorrect).

The correct answer is **Option B**.
