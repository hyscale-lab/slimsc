Okay, so I have this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem says that a solution contains a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14. Their NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm, in a 1:1 ratio. Also, there are three signals around 2.2 ppm, all singlets, in a 2:1:1 ratio. The options are four pairs of compounds, and I need to find out which pair is correct.

First, I should think about the molecular formula. C10H14. Hmm, aromatic compounds usually have benzene rings. Let me compute the degree of unsaturation. For C10H14: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is (2C +2 - H -X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, it's (2*10 +2 -14)/2 = (22-14)/2=4. So that's one benzene ring (3 DoU) and one double bond or ring, but wait, benzene contributes 3 DoU. So remaining is 1, which could be a ring or another double bond. Or maybe another ring if it's a naphthalene, but the molecular formula doesn't match that. Wait, naphthalene is C10H8, so no, that's not it. Alternatively, maybe substituents on the benzene that add up.

Wait, the compounds are tetramethylbenzenes or diethylbenzenes. So each compound has a benzene ring with substituents. Let me see:

- For tetramethylbenzene, each has four methyl groups attached. The formula for that would be C8H10 (since benzene is C6H6, each methyl adds a CH2, but four methyl would add 4*(CH3), so C6 +4C = C10? Wait, wait. No, benzene is C6H6. Adding four methyl groups (each is -CH3). So each methyl adds one C and three H. So C6 +4C is C10. H: benzene has 6 H. Each methyl adds 3 H, but each substitution removes one H (since each substituent takes a position on the ring). So four substituents would have 6-4=2 H on the ring. But each methyl adds 3 H, so 4*3=12 H. So total H would be 2+12=14. So the formula is C10H14. Yes, that matches.

Similarly, diethylbenzene would have two ethyl groups. Each ethyl is -CH2CH3. So two ethyls would add 2*(2 C) =4 C, so the molecule would be C8H10 (benzene + 2 ethyl groups. Let me compute H: benzene has 6 H. Each ethyl substitution removes one H, so 6-2=4 H on the ring. Each ethyl adds 2*3=6 H (since each ethyl has two CH2 groups?), wait no. Each ethyl is -CH2CH3, which has 2+3=5 H? Wait, no, each ethyl group is two carbons attached. So for each ethyl, the substituent is -CH2CH3. So each ethyl adds 2*(2 H from CH2) + 3 H from CH3? Wait, no. The substituent is a single ethyl group. So each ethyl has 2 carbons, but how many H? The ethyl group is -CH2CH3, which has 2 methyl Hs (the CH2 has 2 H) and a CH3 (3 H), so total 5 H per ethyl. But when attached to the benzene, the Hs are all part of the substituent.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think about the molecular formula. Diethylbenzene: benzene is C6H6. Each ethyl is C2H5. So two ethyl groups add 2*(C2H5) → C4H10. So total would be C6 + C4 = C10. H: 6 + 10 = 16? No, wait. Because each ethyl is attached as a substituent, each substitution replaces a H. So two substituents would replace two H. So total H would be 6 (benzene) + 10 (from two ethyl groups) -2 (replaced) =14. So formula is C10H14. That matches.

So the two compounds could be either diethylbenzenes or tetramethylbenzenes.

Looking at the options, the given compounds are:

Option 1: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Option 2: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Option 3: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.

Option 4: 1,4-diethylbenzene.

Wait, the options are four pairs. The question lists four possible compounds, and the options pair two of them.

So each pair consists of two of these four.

Now, the NMR data: aromatic region has two singlets integrating to 1:1, and around 2.2 ppm, three singlets in 2:1:1.

First, I think about the aromatic protons. In a mono-substituted benzene, the H's can be ortho, meta, or para. But when there are multiple substituents, the symmetry can lead to different NMR signals.

Wait, the aromatic signals are two singlets. So that suggests two different sets of aromatic protons, each set being equivalent and giving a singlet. Since it's a 1:1 ratio, each compound contributes equally to the NMR in their respective signals.

Wait, but the NMR is a mixture of two compounds. So each compound contributes its own aromatic protons, but the problem states that the spectrum shows two signals, each singlet. Hmm, perhaps each compound contributes a single set of aromatic protons, and their signals are overlapping in a way that they are two separate singlets.

Wait, wait, let me think again. The mixture is 1:1, so each component contributes equally. So the NMR would show all the signals from both compounds. But the aromatic region has two signals, each a singlet. So each aromatic set must have only one type of H, and both compounds must each contribute one singlet. But since it's a 1:1 mixture, the integration would be 1:1 for each signal.

Wait, but the two signals are at around 6.7 ppm, each a singlet. So each compound has only one set of aromatic protons, each being a singlet. So each compound is such that all aromatic Hs are equivalent, leading to a single singlet.

Ah, so we're looking for two compounds where each has only one type of aromatic H, which is the case for highly symmetrical structures.

Which of the given compounds have only one type of aromatic H?

Let me check each compound:

1. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: the substituents are at positions 1,2,4,5. Let me visualize the benzene ring. If the substituents are at 1 and 2, and 4 and 5, that's two pairs of adjacent substituents. Wait, maybe it's a 1,2,4,5 substitution. Let me draw it. Positions 1 and 2 are adjacent, 4 and 5 are adjacent. So the substituents are in a sort of para arrangement? Or maybe it's a para arrangement but with substituents in two adjacent positions on each side.

Wait, perhaps the structure is like having two substituents in adjacent positions (1,2) and another two substituents in adjacent positions (4,5). So the substituents are in a 1,2 and 4,5 pattern. Is this structure symmetric? Let me think. If the substituents are in 1,2,4,5, that's four substituents arranged as two adjacent pairs on opposite ends. Wait, that would create symmetry. Because substituents are on positions 1,2,4,5, which are across from each other as 1 opposite 4, and 2 opposite 5. So, for each substituent in position 1, there's a substituent in 4 (adjacent to 3 and 5?), no, perhaps not. Wait, maybe this structure is symmetric across a certain axis.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making all the aromatic protons equivalent. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has a plane of symmetry through the ring. For example, if the substituents are arranged such that opposite positions have substituents, the molecule may be symmetrical, leading all Hs on the ring to be equivalent.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged such that the ring has D2h symmetry or something, making all the Hs equivalent.

Wait, but a benzene ring with four substituents might not have all Hs equivalent unless the substituents are arranged in a way that creates symmetry.

Wait, let me think about 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene. Substituents at 1,2,4,5. So the ring would have methyl groups at 1,2,4,5, which are adjacent in a way that they form two adjacent pairs on opposite sides.

Wait, the ring would have substituents at positions 1,2,4,5, which are adjacent in pairs. So, for example, positions 1 and 2 are adjacent, and 4 and 5 are adjacent. But 1 is opposite to 4, and 2 is opposite to 5?

Wait, no, in a benzene ring, position 1 is opposite to 4, 2 opposite to 5, and 3 opposite to 6. So substituents at 1,2,4,5 would be on positions that are opposite each other. So substituents are on 1 and 4 (opposite), and 2 and 5 (opposite). So that would make the structure symmetric. Thus, the Hs on the ring would be the same. But wait, if the substituents are on 1 and 4, but also on 2 and 5, which are also opposites, then the ring would have four substituents in a symmetric fashion. So, perhaps the only Hs left are at positions 3 and 6. Are they equivalent?

Wait, if substituents are at 1,2,4,5, then positions 3 and 6 are each adjacent to two substituents. Wait, but in this arrangement, would the Hs at 3 and 6 be equivalent? Let me imagine the ring. If substituents are at 1 (say, top), 2 (top right), 4 (bottom), 5 (bottom right), then the remaining positions are 3 (left) and 6 (right). Wait, perhaps they're equivalent.

So perhaps in 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, all aromatic Hs are equivalent, giving a single peak as a singlet. So that would contribute one singlet in the aromatic region.

Now, looking at the other options.

1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: substituents at 1,2,3,4. So positions 1,2,3,4 are all substituted. That leaves 5 and 6. Are the Hs at 5 and 6 equivalent? Wait, let's imagine the substituents are 1,2,3,4. So substituents are in four consecutive positions. That would leave positions 5 and 6, which are adjacent, but are they equivalent?

Wait, if the substituents are 1,2,3,4, the ring would have substituents on four adjacent positions, making the structure less symmetric. So perhaps the Hs at 5 and 6 are in different environments. So each would have a different chemical shift. Hmm, but wait, maybe there's some symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene has a high symmetry. Let me think: substituents are at 1,2,3,4. So the ring would look like a para-substituted structure but with four substituents in a row. Wait, perhaps the structure is such that positions 1 and 4 are opposite each other, but substituents are at 1,2,3,4. Maybe it's a highly symmetrical structure.

Wait, perhaps the compound 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is also known as 1,2,3,4-tetra-methylbenzene. But I'm not sure about its symmetry. Let me think: substituents are at 1,2,3,4. So, substituents are in positions 1 (top), 2 (top right), 3 (bottom right), 4 (bottom). Then, the positions 5 and 6 are adjacent but opposite. Hmm, I'm not sure if that would make Hs at 5 and 6 equivalent. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the remaining positions are equivalent.

Wait, in 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, positions 5 and 6 are each adjacent to two methyl groups. So perhaps the Hs at 5 and 6 are equivalent, giving a singlet. That would mean this compound contributes a singlet in the aromatic region.

Alternatively, perhaps in 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, the Hs at 5 and 6 are each adjacent to two substituents, but maybe they are equivalent, making a singlet.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me move on and think about the other compounds.

1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: substituents at 1,2,3,5. So positions 1,2,3,5 are occupied. That leaves positions 4 and 6. Are the Hs at 4 and 6 equivalent?

Hmm, this arrangement is a bit tricky. Let me visualize. Positions 1 (top), 2 (top right), 3 (bottom right), 5 (bottom left). So substituents are at 1,2,3,5. Position 4 is adjacent to 3 and 5 (since 3 and 5 are substituents), and position 6 is adjacent to 5 and 1. Wait, in this arrangement, I'm not sure if 4 and 6 are equivalent. Perhaps they're in different environments, so their Hs would give different signals.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is symmetric in some way. Maybe there's a mirror plane or a rotational axis that makes the Hs at 4 and 6 equivalent. I'm not sure. But if they're not equivalent, the aromatic region would have more than one signal. So perhaps this compound would not contribute a single singlet.

Now, the other compound in some options is 1,4-diethylbenzene. So substituents at 1 and 4 (para positions) as ethyl groups.

In 1,4-diethylbenzene, the substituents are para to each other. So, how many types of aromatic Hs are present?

In 1,4-diethylbenzene, the ring has two ethyl groups opposite each other. The Hs on the benzene ring would be at positions 2,3,5,6. Let me consider the symmetry: since the substituents are at 1 and 4, positions 2 and 6 are equivalent, and positions 3 and 5 are equivalent.

So, Hs at 2 and 6 are equivalent, and Hs at 3 and 5 are equivalent. So, the aromatic region would show two sets of Hs, each as a doublet or singlet, depending on coupling.

Wait, but in the NMR spectrum, each aromatic signal is a singlet. So for 1,4-diethylbenzene, each set of Hs (2,6 and 3,5) would be a doublet if there's coupling. But the problem states that the aromatic signals are singlets, so perhaps in this structure, the Hs are not split by coupling, meaning they're equivalent and perhaps don't have neighboring Hs. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, no. Each H in a benzene ring is coupled with adjacent Hs. So if two Hs are equivalent, and their adjacent Hs are also equivalent, then the splitting could lead to a doublet or a singlet. Wait, maybe in some cases, like when the substituents are in para positions, the adjacent Hs are equivalent, leading to a doublet that might integrate as a singlet if the coupling is not observed.

Wait, perhaps in this structure, each H is adjacent to two Hs, which are equivalent, leading to a triplet. Or maybe the coupling constants are such that it appears as a singlet. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are such that the ring currents cause the Hs to be deshielded in a way that their splitting isn't observed, or perhaps the substituents are bulky and cause the Hs to be more deshielded, but I'm not an expert on that.

Alternatively, perhaps the aromatic Hs in 1,4-diethylbenzene are all equivalent, giving a single singlet. Wait, no, because substituents are only at 1 and 4. So, the ring has Hs at positions 2,3,5,6. Those would be in two pairs: 2 and 6 are equivalent, and 3 and 5 are equivalent. So, the aromatic region would show two signals, each integrating to two Hs each. But since the mixture is 1:1, each of these two signals would contribute to the NMR.

Wait, but the problem says the aromatic region has two signals (two singlets) in a 1:1 ratio. So each compound contributes a single aromatic signal. So, the 1,4-diethylbenzene would have two aromatic signals, but the problem says each compound contributes one. Wait, that can't be. So perhaps 1,4-diethylbenzene is not one of the compounds in the mixture, because it would contribute two signals, but the NMR only shows two overall.

Wait, but the mixture is 1:1 between two compounds. Each compound contributes their own signals. So perhaps the first compound contributes one singlet, and the second contributes another singlet, making two signals in total.

Wait, that makes sense. So each compound must have only one type of aromatic H, so that in the NMR, each contributes a single singlet.

So, the two compounds in the mixture each have only one type of aromatic H, leading to two singlets in the aromatic region.

Which of the given compounds have only one type of aromatic H?

Looking at the options:

1. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: If all aromatic Hs are equivalent, this would contribute a singlet.

2. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: If all aromatic Hs are equivalent, this would contribute a singlet.

3. 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: Probably more than one type of aromatic H, so would contribute more than one signal.

4. 1,4-diethylbenzene: Probably two types of aromatic Hs (two sets), so would contribute two signals.

So, the mixture can't include 1,4-diethylbenzene, because if it's present, the aromatic region would have more than two signals. Wait, no: the mixture is two compounds, each contributing their own signals. So if one compound contributes one signal and the other contributes another, the total would be two. So perhaps 1,4-diethylbenzene is one of the compounds, but in that case, it would contribute two signals. So the other compound would have to contribute zero, which is impossible. So 1,4-diethylbenzene can't be part of the mixture because it would add more than one signal.

So the two compounds in the mixture must be tetramethylbenzenes that each have only one type of aromatic H.

Which of the options have that?

Looking at the options:

Option A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Wait, if 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene has only one type of aromatic H, and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene has more than one, then this option would not fit because the second compound would give multiple signals.

Option B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.

If both of these have only one type of aromatic H, then the mixture would show two singlets, which matches the NMR data.

Option C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene.

But 1,4-diethylbenzene has two types of aromatic H, so the NMR would show more than two signals. So this is not possible.

Option D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

If the first has one signal, the second has more than one, so the mixture would show more than two signals. So not possible.

So the only viable option is option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.

Wait, but let me check whether each of these has only one type of aromatic H.

For 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: substituents at 1,2,4,5. Are the remaining Hs at 3 and 6 equivalent? Let me imagine the structure. Substituents at 1 and 2 (adjacent), and 4 and 5 (adjacent). So positions 3 and 6 would each have substituents adjacent to them. But are 3 and 6 equivalent? Let me think about symmetry.

If I rotate the ring 180 degrees, substituents at 1 and 2 would swap places with 4 and 5. So, position 3 would swap with position 6. So, yes, they are equivalent. So the Hs at 3 and 6 would be equivalent, giving a singlet.

For 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: substituents at 1,2,3,4. The remaining Hs are at 5 and 6. Are 5 and 6 equivalent? Let's see. The substituents are arranged such that positions 1,2,3,4 are substituted. So, position 5 is adjacent to substituents at 4 and 6? Wait, no, position 5 is adjacent to 4 and 6. Wait, substituents at 1,2,3,4: position 5 is next to substituents at 4 and 6. No, position 5 is adjacent to 4 and 6, but substituent at 4 is present. So, is position 6 adjacent to substituent at 5? Wait, the substituents are at 1,2,3,4. So, position 5 is between substituents 4 and 6 (but 6 is not substituted). Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps in 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, substituents are at 1,2,3,4. So the ring looks like a four-substituted ring in a row. The remaining positions are 5 and 6. Are 5 and 6 equivalent?

If I imagine the ring, substituents are at positions 1,2,3,4. So, substituent at 1 (top), 2 (top right), 3 (bottom right), 4 (bottom). Positions 5 and 6 would be at the left and the opposite left. So, perhaps the structure is symmetric across the vertical axis. So, substituents at 1 and 4 are opposite each other, and 2 and 3 are opposite each other. So positions 5 and 6 would be mirror images, hence equivalent. So their Hs would be equivalent, leading to a singlet in the aromatic region.

So, both 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene have only one type of aromatic H, each giving a singlet. So when mixed 1:1, the NMR would show two singlets, each at around 6.7 ppm.

Now, looking at the other part of the NMR spectrum: three signals around 2.2 ppm, all singlets, in a 2:1:1 ratio.

The signals at 2.2 ppm are likely from methyl groups attached to something. Since the options include tetramethylbenzenes and diethylbenzenes, the 2.2 ppm signals would be from either methyl groups (-CH3) or ethyl groups (CH2CH3).

Wait, but ethyl groups in the para position would have different environments. Let me think about the integration. The signals are in a 2:1:1 ratio. So perhaps one compound contributes two sets of methyl groups, and the other contributes one, but not sure.

Alternatively, let's consider each compound's structure and the number of methyl groups.

Looking at the options:

Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.

Each of these has four methyl groups. So each would have four equivalent methyl groups? Wait, no, because in 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, the methyl groups are at 1,2,4,5. Are these equivalent?

Wait, in 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, the substituents are at positions 1,2,4,5. Each methyl group at 1 and 2 are in adjacent positions, and 4 and 5 are adjacent. Are the methyl groups at 1 and 2 equivalent? Let's see.

If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then the methyl groups at 1 and 2 would be equivalent. Similarly, those at 4 and 5 would be equivalent. So, perhaps there are two sets of two equivalent methyl groups. Wait, but each is attached to a different position. Alternatively, perhaps all four methyl groups are equivalent.

Wait, perhaps the symmetry of the molecule makes all four methyl groups equivalent. So their signals would be a single peak. Alternatively, maybe they are in two different environments, giving two signals.

Wait, in 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, the substituents are arranged symmetrically as two pairs of adjacent methyl groups. So, perhaps the methyl groups at 1 and 5 are equivalent, and those at 2 and 4 are equivalent. Or maybe they are all equivalent.

Wait, let me think again. The structure has methyl groups at 1,2,4,5. Let's consider whether these are equivalent.

If the molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the ring through the middle, perhaps the methyl groups at 1 and 5 are mirror images, and the same for 2 and 4. But in that case, each pair would be equivalent, but the two pairs might not be equivalent to each other. So, the methyl groups at 1 and 5 would be equivalent, and those at 2 and 4 would be equivalent, leading to two signals for the methyl groups.

Similarly, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene has methyl groups at 1,2,3,4. Are these all equivalent? Let me imagine the structure. The substituents are at four consecutive positions, so the ring has a kind of rotational symmetry. Each methyl group is in a different position, but perhaps due to the symmetry, all four are equivalent. Or perhaps they form two pairs of equivalent groups.

Wait, let me think about the symmetry. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene has substituents in four consecutive positions. This structure is similar to 1,2,3,4-tetra-para positions, but perhaps it's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a center of inversion, making all four methyl groups equivalent. Thus, their signals would all be a single peak.

Wait, but if the substituents are at 1,2,3,4, perhaps the molecule has a two-fold axis of rotation, making the methyl groups at 1 and 3 equivalent, and those at 2 and 4 equivalent. So that would lead to two signals for the methyl groups.

So, let's say:

- Compound A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene → two sets of methyl groups (e.g., at 1 and 5, and 2 and 4), giving two signals.

- Compound B: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene → two sets of methyl groups (e.g., at 1 and 3, and 2 and 4), giving two signals.

But wait, in the NMR, the aliphatic region shows three signals at 2.2 ppm, in 2:1:1 ratio.

If each compound contributes two signals, but the mixture shows three, perhaps one compound contributes two signals and the other contributes one.

Alternatively, perhaps one compound has two equivalent methyl groups, and another has three sets.

Wait, but both are tetramethylbenzenes, each having four methyl groups. So perhaps they each have two sets of two equivalent methyl groups.

But the integration is 2:1:1. That adds up to four parts.

Wait, 2:1:1 is a total of four, which perhaps corresponds to the four methyl groups from both compounds.

Wait, but each compound contributes four methyl groups.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Let me think again. The NMR has three signals in the aliphatic region, each a singlet, in a 2:1:1 ratio.

So, integrating to 2, 1, and 1.

In terms of integration, the total number of H's from aliphatic regions would be 2+1+1=4, which is (since each compound has four methyl groups, which contribute 12 H each? Wait, no.

Wait, wait, each methyl group has three Hs. So four methyl groups would be 4*3=12 H. But in the mixture, each compound contributes 12 H, but since it's a 1:1 mixture, each contributes 12 H, but the NMR shows 2:1:1, which is a total of four H's? No, that can't be.

Wait, no. The integration in NMR is relative. So the three signals in the aliphatic region have areas in the ratio 2:1:1. So, for example, the first signal is 2 parts, the others 1 each. The actual number of H's depends on the number of H per group.

Wait, perhaps the three signals correspond to different types of CH3 groups.

If one compound has two types of methyl groups and the other has one type, perhaps.

But how?

Let me think about the options again. Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.

In 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, suppose the methyl groups are arranged as two pairs: groups at 1 and 5 are equivalent, groups at 2 and 4 are equivalent. So, two signals for the methyl groups.

In 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, perhaps the methyl groups are arranged as two pairs: groups at 1 and 3 are equivalent, groups at 2 and 4 are equivalent. So, two signals here as well.

But when mixed, each would contribute two signals. So the total would be four signals. But the NMR shows three. So perhaps that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the compounds has all four methyl groups equivalent, giving a single signal. The other has two sets, giving two signals. So total three signals.

So, which of the options fits this?

If 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has two sets (say, two methyl groups each in two different environments), and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene has all four methyl groups equivalent, then the mixture would have 2 (from first) +1 (from second) = 3 signals. The integration would depend on the number of Hs per group.

Wait, for example, if the first compound contributes two signals (each integrating to 2 H groups) and the second contributes one signal (integrating to 2 H groups?), but I'm getting a bit stuck on the integration aspect.

Alternatively, perhaps looking at the integration ratio 2:1:1, which sums to 4. Since each methyl group contributes 3 H, perhaps the three signals correspond to (2 methyl groups, 1 methyl group, and 1 methyl group). But that would be 2*3 +1*3 +1*3 = 12 H. Which would fit with each compound having four methyl groups (each with 3 H, so 12 H each). But the mixture is 1:1, so each contributes 12 H. So the total aliphatic H would be 24, but the integration is 4 (2+1+1), which doesn't make sense. I'm probably mixing up the concepts here.

Wait, perhaps the integration in the NMR is for the number of Hs in each signal. So, if the three signals are in 2:1:1 ratio, that would be 2x, x, x, with x being the same unit. So 2x + x + x =4x. Each x would correspond to the same number of Hs.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should approach this differently.

The aliphatic region shows three singlets at around 2.2 ppm. Each is a singlet, so no splitting, meaning the groups are probably not next to any protons that would cause splitting. That suggests they're either in an environment with no adjacent protons (like being attached to a benzene ring where adjacent groups don't have protons) or they're in a symmetric environment where their neighboring groups are equivalent.

Methyl groups attached to the benzene ring (as in tetramethylbenzenes) would be -CH3, each with three Hs. These are typically singlets because the adjacent groups are either all methyl (so no splitting) or arranged symmetrically. So, for example, in para-xylene (1,4-dimethylbenzene), the two methyl groups are equivalent, giving a singlet.

In the case of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, perhaps the methyl groups are in two different environments, leading to two singlets. For example, two methyl groups in one environment (like being adjacent to each other) and the other two in another environment.

Similarly, in 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, the methyl groups might all be in the same environment, giving a single singlet.

Wait, that's an interesting thought. If 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene has all four methyl groups in the same environment, then their Hs would all appear as a single singlet. While 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has two sets of methyl groups, giving two singlets. So, when mixed 1:1, the aliphatic region would have three signals: two from the first compound (each integrating to 2 methyl groups, 3 H each) and one from the second (4 methyl groups, 3 H each). Wait, but that would give three signals: 6 H (2 groups), 6 H (1 group), but that doesn't match the integration ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps the integration ratios are based on the number of Hs per signal. Each methyl group contributes 3 H. So the 2:1:1 ratio could mean the signals have 6 H, 3 H, and 3 H.

So, one compound contributes a singlet with 6 H (two methyl groups), and another contributes a singlet with 6 H (two methyl groups) and another singlet with 3 H (one methyl group). But I'm not sure how that would fit.

Alternatively, perhaps one compound has two types of methyl groups (each with 3 H) and the other has one type (with 6 H). But that might not fit.

Wait, maybe the three signals are from different kinds of groups. For example, if one compound has a singlet from four methyl groups (12 H) and another has a singlet from two methyl groups (6 H), but that would make the integration 12:6, which is 2:1. But the NMR shows three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio, which would be 2x, x, x.

Wait, maybe each of the two compounds contributes two methyl groups each, but in different environments.

Alternatively, perhaps the three signals are due to one compound contributing two signals (each from two methyl groups) and another contributing one signal (from four methyl groups). But I'm getting stuck here.

Another approach: let's look at the options and see which pair would result in three aliphatic signals.

Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.

Assuming that 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has two types of methyl groups (say, two methyl groups each with 3 H, giving two signals: each integrating to 2 (since each is 3 H, but perhaps in the ratio, it's 2:1:1, so perhaps the two signals from the first compound are 2 and 1, and the second compound contributes 1.

Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps each methyl group in 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has 3 H, and they are split into two signals, each integrating to 2 (each being 6 H). Hmm, but this might not fit.

Alternatively, maybe each of the two compounds contributes two signals, but they overlap in such a way that one signal from each combines into a single peak, leading to three signals in total.

Alternatively, maybe each compound contributes some methyl groups that are equivalent across the two compounds.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the integration ratios in the aliphatic region. The three signals are in a 2:1:1 ratio. So, perhaps one compound contributes a singlet integrating to 2 parts, and the other contributes two singlets, each integrating to 1 part.

So, for example, the first compound has a singlet of 6 H (two methyl groups), and the second has two singlets, each of 3 H (one methyl group each).

Wait, but each methyl group has 3 H. So, a singlet for two methyl groups would integrate to 6 H, and a singlet for one group to 3 H.

So, the three signals could be 6 H, 3 H, 3 H → which would be in a 2:1:1 ratio (since 6 is twice 3).

Yes! So, one compound contributes a singlet integrating to 6 H (two methyl groups), and the other contributes two singlets, each integrating to 3 H (one methyl group each).

Which of the options would fit this scenario?

Looking at the options, let's see:

If 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has two different types of methyl groups, perhaps one pair and another pair, each with 2 groups and 6 H (2*3=6 H) and another pair with 2 groups and 6 H. Wait, but that would give two signals, each integrating to 6 H, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has two methyl groups that are equivalent (say, the ones at 1 and 5) and the other two (at 2 and 4) are equivalent but different from the first pair. So, two signals: each integrating to 6 H. That's 6 H each. So, the NMR would show two signals, each 6 H, but the problem says three.

Hmm, perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene has all four methyl groups equivalent, giving a single singlet of 12 H (4*3=12 H). Then, the other compound, 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, has two sets of methyl groups, each with 3 H. So, two signals, each 3 H. Then, the aliphatic region would have three signals: 12 H (from one compound), and two 3 H (from the other). But the ratio would be 4:1:1, which doesn't match the 2:1:1 given.

So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps each of the two compounds contributes two signals, but one of the signals overlaps. For example, both compounds have a methyl group in a similar environment, leading their signals to overlap, resulting in a combined signal.

But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, let me think about each compound's methyl groups:

1. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: perhaps two pairs of methyl groups (each pair at mirrored positions), each pair being equivalent. So, two signals: each for two methyl groups (6 H each).

2. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: perhaps all four methyl groups are equivalent, giving one signal (12 H).

So, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, the aliphatic region would show:

- From first compound: two signals at 6 H each.

- From second compound: one signal at 12 H.

But the NMR shows three signals: two from the first (6 and 6) and one from the second (12). But the integration would be 6,6,12 → which is 1:1:2 ratio, but the problem states it's 2:1:1.

Alternatively, perhaps the first compound contributes two signals, each 3 H (so two singlets, 3 H each), and the second contributes a singlet of 6 H (two methyl groups). So the ratio is 6:3:3 → which simplifies to 2:1:1.

That would fit. So, in this scenario, one compound (say, the second) has two methyl groups, contributing 6 H, and the other compound (the first) has four methyl groups, but in two different environments, each contributing 3 H.

Which of the options would fit that?

If 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene has all four methyl groups equivalent, giving a singlet of 12 H. But that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has two pairs of methyl groups: one pair with 3 H each (so two methyl groups, 6 H) and another pair with 3 H each (another two methyl groups, 6 H). But that would give two signals, each 6 H.

Wait, but that doesn't explain the 2:1:1 ratio.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternative approach: Let's think about the possible structures.

Option B is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.

1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has four methyl groups, but maybe two pairs are equivalent. So, two signals in aliphatic region, each integrating to 6 H.

1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene perhaps has four methyl groups, but in two environments: two methyl groups in one environment (6 H) and two in another (6 H). Wait, but that would give two signals, each 6 H.

But the NMR shows three signals in 2:1:1 ratio. So, perhaps the two compounds contribute 6,6, and 12 H, but that would give a ratio of 1:1:2, not 2:1:1.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the compounds has two methyl groups (3 H) and the other has four, but in two different environments (6 H each).

Wait, but that doesn't make sense. The tetramethyl compounds have four methyl groups each.

Hmm, perhaps the problem requires looking at the integration in terms of the number of groups, not the number of Hs. So, if the three signals are from two groups (each with two methyl groups) and one group (with one methyl group), the integration would be 2:1:1.

Wait, but that would be 2 parts from two groups, each contributing one signal. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the three signals correspond to different types of substituents. For example, one from methyl groups, one from ethyl groups, and another from methyl groups. But the options are either tetramethyl or diethyl.

Wait, another thought: 1,4-diethylbenzene would have ethyl groups. Each ethyl group has two CH2 groups, but in a benzene ring, the ethyl substituents would split into their own peaks.

Wait, in 1,4-diethylbenzene, each ethyl group is attached to the benzene. So, each CH2CH3 group would have the CH2 close to the ring and the CH3 at the end. The CH2 groups would be deshielded and appear around 2.2 ppm as a triplet due to coupling with the adjacent CH3, but perhaps in the case of symmetry, they might appear as a singlet. Alternatively, the CH3 groups in the ethyl substituents would appear around 1.2 ppm as a triplet.

Wait, but the problem states that the aliphatic signals are at around 2.2 ppm. So perhaps the CH2 groups are what's showing up there.

Wait, but in the NMR, the aliphatic region shows three signals at around 2.2 ppm, all singlets. So, maybe these are CH2 groups from ethyl substituents that are equivalent and not split.

But earlier, I thought that 1,4-diethylbenzene would contribute two aromatic signals, which would complicate the NMR beyond the given data. So perhaps the correct pair doesn't include diethylbenzene.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck and perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the earlier analysis.

Based on the aromatic region, the correct pair must be the two tetramethylbenzenes that each have only one type of aromatic H, i.e., option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.

As for the aliphatic region, perhaps in 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, the methyl groups are in two different environments (two sets of two each), giving two signals, each 6 H. In 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, all four methyl groups are equivalent, giving one signal of 12 H. But when mixed, the aliphatic region would show three signals: 6,6,12. Which would be a ratio of 1:1:2, but the problem states 2:1:1. So maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps each compound has two different methyl groups, and when mixed, the signals add up.

Wait, perhaps the first compound (1,2,4,5) has two methyl groups in one environment (3 H each) and the other two in another environment (3 H each), giving two signals, each 6 H. The second compound (1,2,3,4) has all four methyl groups in one environment, giving a singlet of 12 H. So, the aliphatic region would have three signals: two at 6 H and one at 12 H. The ratio would be 6:6:12 → which simplifies to 1:1:2. But the problem says 2:1:1.

So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the first compound contributes one signal of 6 H, and the second contributes two signals of 3 H each. But how?

Wait, perhaps 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has all four methyl groups equivalent, giving one signal of 12 H. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene has two sets of methyl groups (each with 6 H). So the aliphatic region would have three signals: 12,6,6 → ratio of 2:1:1. Because 12 is 2 parts, and 6 is 1 part each. So 12:6:6 → 2:1:1.

Yes! That makes sense. So:

- 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has all four methyl groups equivalent, giving a singlet of 12 H. But wait, earlier I thought that it has two sets of methyl groups. Hmm, perhaps I was wrong.

Wait, perhaps 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has all four methyl groups in the same environment. So, their Hs would give a singlet of 12 H.

Whereas 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene has four methyl groups, but in two different environments (each with two methyl groups), giving two singlets, each 6 H.

So when mixed, the aliphatic region would have:

- 12 H (from first compound) → 2 parts,

- 6 H (from second compound) → 1 part,

- 6 H (from second compound) → 1 part.

So the ratio is 2:1:1, which matches the NMR data.

So the correct pair is option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining which two aromatic compounds, from a 1:1 mixture, match the given NMR data. The molecular formula of the compounds is C10H14, and the NMR spectrum shows two aromatic singlets at ~6.7 ppm (1:1 ratio) and three aliphatic singlets at ~2.2 ppm (2:1:1 ratio). The options provided are pairs of tetramethylbenzenes or diethylbenzene.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation**:  
   The molecular formula C10H14 corresponds to one benzene ring (C6H6) with four methyl groups (C4H8), as each methyl group (-CH3) contributes one carbon and three hydrogens. This matches the description of tetramethylbenzenes.

2. **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm)**:  
   The NMR shows two aromatic singlets, indicating that each compound contributes one type of aromatic proton environment. This requires the compounds to have high symmetry, ensuring all aromatic protons are equivalent.

   - **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene**:  
     Substituents at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 create a symmetric structure. The remaining positions (3 and 6) are equivalent due to symmetry, resulting in a single aromatic singlet.

   - **1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene**:  
     Substituents at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4 also create a symmetric structure. The remaining positions (5 and 6) are equivalent, resulting in a single aromatic singlet.

   - **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-Diethylbenzene**:  
     These compounds lack sufficient symmetry, leading to multiple aromatic signals, which does not match the NMR data.

3. **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm)**:  
   The three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio suggest that the methyl groups are in different environments. Each compound contributes its own methyl groups, and their symmetry determines the number of signals.

   - **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene**:  
     The methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 are in two equivalent pairs, contributing two aliphatic signals (each integrating to 6 H).

   - **1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene**:  
     The methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4 are all equivalent, contributing a single aliphatic signal (integrating to 12 H).

   When mixed in a 1:1 ratio, the aliphatic region combines to show three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio (12 H from one compound and 6 H from the other).

4. **Elimination of Other Options**:  
   - **Option A**: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.  
     1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene lacks symmetry, leading to multiple aromatic signals, which does not match the NMR data.

   - **Option C**: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene.  
     1,4-Diethylbenzene would contribute two aromatic signals, inconsistent with the NMR data.

   - **Option D**: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.  
     1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene lacks symmetry, leading to multiple aromatic signals, which does not match the NMR data.

### Conclusion:  
The correct pair of compounds is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**, as they match both the aromatic and aliphatic NMR data.

**Answer: B**
