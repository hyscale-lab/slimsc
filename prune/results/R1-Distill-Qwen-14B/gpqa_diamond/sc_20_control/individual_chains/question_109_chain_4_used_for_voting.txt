Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and break it down. The question is about a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X. The particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics come into play here, which relates the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state. The condition given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. 

The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. I need to find out which partial wave is not permitted. The options are A to D, each showing a transition from the initial state 1S0 to another state plus a particle (p, f, s, etc.). 

Hmm, okay. Let me recall what I know about angular momentum addition and conservation, as well as parity. The key points here are angular momentum conservation and parity conservation. 

Firstly, the initial state is 1S0. The term symbol is given as (2S+1)L(J). So for 1S0, S is 0 because 2S+1 = 1 implies S=0. L is the orbital angular momentum, here S which is 0. So the initial state has L=0, S=0, and J=0 since J = L + S.

When the two nucleons emit a particle X, the final state will have some orbital angular momentum, spin, and isospin. The Pauli condition given is T = S + L +1 mod 2. Since the final T is 0, that means 0 ≡ S + L +1 mod 2. Which implies S + L must be 1 mod 2, so S + L is odd. 

Wait, so the sum of the spin and orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for the NN system must be odd for T=0. 

Let me think about the parity. The parity of a state is given by (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum. The initial state has L=0, so parity is +1. The emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1. The overall parity must be conserved, so the initial parity times the parity of X equals the final parity. 

Wait, initial parity is +1. The emitted particle X has parity -1. But when considering the process, the parity of the initial state times the parity of X should equal the parity of the final state. Or wait, maybe I should think in terms of the reaction:

The initial state (1S0) has parity Π_initial = (-1)^L_initial = (-1)^0 = +1. 

After emitting X, the final state is the NN system in some state (let's call it the NN state) and the X particle. The parity conservation would be Π_initial = Π_NN_final * Π_X. 

So Π_NN_final = Π_initial / Π_X. Since Π_X is -1, Π_NN_final = (+1)/(-1) = -1. 

Wait, no, maybe I should think of it as the product of the parities of the final states. The parity of the initial state (before emission) is Π_initial. The parity after emission is the product of the parity of the final NN state and the parity of X. So Π_initial = Π_NN_final * Π_X. 

So rearranging, Π_NN_final = Π_initial / Π_X. 

Since Π_initial is +1 and Π_X is -1, then Π_NN_final is (-1). So the NN system after emission has parity -1. 

The parity of the NN state is given by (-1)^L_NN. So, (-1)^L_NN = -1 => L_NN must be odd. So L_NN must be 1, 3, 5, etc. 

Now, the possible orbital angular momentum for the NN system after emission must be an odd integer. 

Looking at the options, each option describes a transition to a state with a specific L and S. Let me list each option:

Option A: 7D1 + p. Wait, the term after the arrow is the final state. So the final state is 7D1, and X is p (which is a particle with some properties). Wait, but the partial waves are denoted by the lowercase letters (s, p, d, f) which correspond to L=0,1,2,3. So in each option, the letter after the plus is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle X. 

Wait, the options are like 1S0 -> 3S1 + p. So the emitted particle X is a proton (p), which has L=1 (p state). So for each option, X has L equal to its letter's value (p=1, s=0, d=2, f=3). 

But wait, the parity of X is given as -1. So X's parity is (-1)^(L_X). Because the intrinsic parity for a boson (like a meson) is given by (-1)^{L+1} if it's a pseudoscalar, but wait, the problem says X has intrinsic parity -1. Hmm... Let me think. 

Wait, the intrinsic parity of a particle is a property of the particle, regardless of its state. For example, for a pion (which is a pseudoscalar meson), its intrinsic parity is -1. But the parity of the emitted particle X is given as -1. So the parity of X's state is determined by its intrinsic parity and its orbital angular momentum. Or is the parity of X simply its intrinsic parity? Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. 

Wait, the parity of a state of a particle is determined by its intrinsic parity multiplied by (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum. But in this problem, the X particle is emitted, and the question states that X has intrinsic parity -1. So the parity of the X in the emitted state is (-1) * (-1)^L_X. Because the intrinsic parity is -1, and the orbital part is (-1)^L. 

Wait, no. The parity of a single particle is given by Π = Π_0 * (-1)^L, where Π_0 is the intrinsic parity. So for X, Π_X = (-1) * (-1)^L_X. Because Π_0 is -1. 

So the parity of the X is Π_X = (-1)^{L_X + 1}.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me go back. 

The parity of a two-body system (like the NN and X) is the product of their individual parities. The initial state has parity +1. So the final parity is the product of the parity of the NN system and the parity of X. 

Wait, no. Because the initial state is the NN system (parity +1). When the NN system emits X, the final state consists of the NN system and X. So the parity of the initial state is equal to the parity of the final state. Because parity is conserved. 

Wait, no, parity is a multiplicative quantum number. So the parity of the initial state is the product of the parities of the final states. So:

Π_initial = Π_NN_final * Π_X.

So, as before, Π_NN_final * Π_X = +1.

But the problem states that X has intrinsic parity -1. So Π_X = (-1) * (-1)^L_X? Or is it just that the intrinsic parity is -1 regardless of L_X? Hmm, I think the intrinsic parity is a property of the particle, so regardless of what L is, the parity is based on that. But for a particle in a state with orbital angular momentum L, the parity of that state (the wavefunction) would be Π_0 * (-1)^L. So for X, Π_X = (-1) * (-1)^L_X.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think again. 

The intrinsic parity Π_0 is a property of the particle. For example, scalar particles have Π_0 = +1, pseudoscalars have Π_0 = -1. So for X, Π_0 = -1. 

The parity of the X's state would be Π_X = Π_0 * (-1)^L_X. So Π_X = (-1) * (-1)^L_X = (-1)^{L_X + 1}.

So, Π_NN_final = Π_initial / Π_X.

But Π_initial is the parity of the initial state, which is +1.

So Π_NN_final = 1 / [ (-1)^{L_X +1} ].

Wait, 1/parity is the same as parity, because parity is either +1 or -1. So 1/(+1)=+1 and 1/(-1)=-1.

So Π_NN_final = [ (-1)^{L_X + 1} ]^{-1} = (-1)^{ -(L_X +1) } = (-1)^{L_X +1}.

But since Π_NN_final is the parity of the NN system, which is (-1)^{L_NN}.

So, (-1)^{L_NN} = (-1)^{L_X +1}.

Which implies that L_NN ≡ L_X + 1 mod 2.

So L_NN and L_X must have opposite parity. If L_X is even, L_NN must be odd, and vice versa.

Wait, but earlier, from the T condition, we found that L_NN must be odd because L_NN must be odd (since Π_NN_final is -1, so L_NN is odd).

So from parity conservation, L_NN must be odd, which implies that L_X must be even (because L_NN = L_X +1 mod 2 → L_X = L_NN -1 mod 2 → if L_NN is odd, L_X is even).

So X must have even L. Which means X is in an s (L=0) or d (L=2) state, since those are even. 

Looking at the options:

Option A: X is p → L_X=1 → odd. But this would make L_NN even, which contradicts L_NN being odd. So this option would have a problem.

Option B: X is p → L_X=1 → odd. Which again would make L_NN even → can't be, as L_NN is odd. So this is not allowed.

Option C: X is f → L_X=3 → odd. Again, would make L_NN even → not allowed.

Option D: X is s → L_X=0 → even. So L_NN = 0 +1 → 1 mod 2, which is odd. So this is allowed.

Wait, but let's check each option:

Option A: X is p → L=1 (odd). So L_NN must be even. But from T condition, L_NN must be odd. So this is a conflict. So this partial wave (p) is not allowed.

Similarly, option B: X is p → same problem.

Option C: X is f → L=3 (odd). Again, L_NN would be even. Conflict.

Option D: X is s → L=0 (even). So L_NN is 1 mod 2, which is allowed.

But wait, the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So any option where X has L_X odd would not be allowed because that would make L_NN even, violating the T condition.

So looking at the options, let's list each X's L:

A: p → L=1 → odd → not allowed. So this is a possibility for the forbidden.

B: p → same as A.

C: f → L=3 → odd → not allowed.

D: s → L=0 → allowed.

But the question is asking which partial wave is not permitted. So the forbidden ones are A, B, C. But wait, the options are four, so perhaps I've made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should look more carefully at the given condition. The condition is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. And T(NN)=0.

So 0 ≡ S + L + 1 mod 2 → S + L ≡ 1 mod 2 → S + L is odd.

So S and L must have opposite parity. So if L is even (like in D), S must be odd. If L is odd, S must be even.

But wait, in each option, the final state has a term like 3S1, which I think refers to the NN state. So the term symbol is (2S+1)L_J. So for 3S1, (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L is S → L=0? Wait, no, the term symbol is written as (2S+1)L_J.

Wait, wait, the term symbol is given in the question as (2S+1)L(J). So for example, 1S0 would be (2*0 +1) S ^0 → 1S0. The L here is S, which is 0.

But in the final state, each option has a term like 7D1. So (2S+1) is 7, so S=3. The L here is D, which is L=2. And J is 1.

So for each option, the NN final state has S and L. So let's compute S + L mod 2.

Option A: 7D1. S=3 (since 2S+1=7 → S=3). L=2 (D). S+L=3+2=5 → 1 mod 2. Which is odd. So T=0, which fits the condition.

Option B: 3S1. S=1 (since 2S+1=3 → S=1). L=0 (S). S+L=1+0=1 → 1 mod 2. So fits.

Option C: 3D3. S=1 (since 2S+1=3 → S=1). L=2 (D). S+L=3 → 1 mod 2. Fits.

Option D: 3P0. S=1 (since 2S+1=3 → S=1). L=1 (P). S+L=2 → 0 mod 2. Which is even. But the condition requires S+L to be 1 mod 2. So this would make T=0, because T = S + L +1 mod 2. Wait:

Wait, T = S + L +1 mod 2. If S + L is even (mod 2 is 0), then T = 0 +1 =1 mod 2. But the given T is 0. So this would not fit. 

Wait a minute, that's another consideration. So for each option, I have to calculate T and see if it's 0.

Wait, but earlier I thought the conclusion was L_NN needs to be odd. Which would make S + L odd, because from T condition, S + L must be 1 mod 2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in my earlier approach.

Let me restate the condition: T = S + L +1 mod 2. And T=0.

So 0 ≡ S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L ≡ 1 mod 2.

So S + L must be odd. So S and L must have opposite parity.

So for each option, let's compute S and L of the NN state.

Option A: 7D1. S=3, L=2. S+L=5 → 1 mod 2. So condition holds.

Option B: 3S1. S=1, L=0. S+L=1 → 1 mod 2. Condition holds.

Option C: 3D3. S=1, L=2. S+L=3 → 1 mod 2. Condition holds.

Option D: 3P0. S=1, L=1. S+L=2 → 0 mod 2. So condition not met. Hence, T would be 0 = (1+1 +1) mod2? Wait, no. Wait, T is supposed to be 0. Let me compute T for each option.

Wait, T = (S + L +1) mod2.

For option D: S=1, L=1.

T = (1 + 1 +1 ) mod2 = 3 mod2 =1. But the given T is 0. So this does not satisfy the condition. So option D's NN state has T=1, which is not allowed. So option D is not allowed.

But wait, earlier from parity conservation, the final NN state must have L= odd (since Π_NN_final is -1 → L is odd). So looking at each option's L:

Option A: L=2 → even. Which would conflict with L_NN being odd. So this is not allowed.

Option B: L=0 → even. So, same problem.

Option C: L=2 → even. Problem.

Option D: L=1 → odd. So this is allowed.

Wait, but D's T is 1, which conflicts with T=0. So the problem arises in two aspects: the T condition and the parity.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the parity considerations. Because earlier, from parity conservation, we found that L_NN must be odd. So any option where the NN state has L even is forbidden.

Looking at each option:

A: L=2 (even) → forbidden.

B: L=0 (even) → forbidden.

C: L=2 (even) → forbidden.

D: L=1 (odd) → allowed.

But D's T comes out to be 1, which is not allowed. So it's not allowed.

So which option is not permitted? The question is which partial wave is not permitted. So a partial wave would correspond to the orbital angular momentum of X, which depends on the allowed L_NN and L_X.

Wait, but perhaps I should approach this using angular momentum conservation. The initial state has J=0. After emission, the total angular momentum is the sum of the NN state's J and the X's L (since X's spin isn't considered here? Or maybe it's part of the angular momentum). Hmm, maybe I should think about the total angular momentum being conserved.

Wait, the initial state has J=0. The final state consists of the NN system (with J = J_NN) and the X (with J_X, which is its spin). But since X is a boson (like a pion), it's spin 0. Or wait, the problem says X is a particle emitted, but I don't know its spin. Hmm, but the problem doesn't give spin info, so perhaps we can ignore it.

Alternatively, the total angular momentum of the system must be conserved. Since initial J=0, the sum of the NN's J and X's orbital angular momentum (in the center of mass frame) must be zero. Wait, but that's complicated. 

Alternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of the NN system (L_NN) plus the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle (L_X) must equal zero. Or maybe not, because orbital angular momentum is relative. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, another approach: the total angular momentum is conserved. The initial state has J=0. The final state has the NN's J and the X's J. But without knowing X's spin, perhaps it's tricky. But in the options, the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum is given. 

Wait, in the options, the letter after the plus sign (like p, s, d, f) denotes the orbital angular momentum state of X. So X has orbital L_X = p→1, s→0, d→2, f→3.

But in the overall process, the initial angular momentum is zero. The final angular momentum is the vector sum of NN's J and X's L_X (since X's spin isn't mentioned). Hmm, but this is getting too complicated. Maybe it's better to focus on the parity and T condition.

Let me recap:

We have two conditions:

1. T_NN = (S_NN + L_NN +1) mod 2 =0 → S + L must be 1 mod 2.

2. L_NN must be odd because Π_NN = (-1)^L_NN = -1 → L_NN is odd.

So when I look at the options:

Option A: NN has L=2 (even) → violates condition 2.

Option B: NN has L=0 → violates condition 2.

Option C: NN has L=2 → violates condition 2.

Option D: NN has L=1 → satisfies condition 2. Now, check condition 1.

In option D, NN state is 3P0 → S=1, L=1. S + L =2 → 0 mod2 → which would make T=0 + 1 =1 mod2, which is not allowed. So option D violates condition 1.

Wait, but earlier from parity, option D's L_NN=1 is allowed. But condition 1 requires T=0, which would require S + L to be 1 mod2. So option D has S + L=2→0 mod2. So T would be 0+1=1 mod2 → which is not allowed. So option D is forbidden.

But wait, earlier I thought that the parity condition allows option D, but the T condition forbids it. So which one is correct?

Hmm. Let's think again. 

The condition T = S + L +1 mod2 must hold, and T is given as 0. So S + L must be 1 mod2.

Additionally, the parity condition requires that L_NN is odd (so L=1,3,...).

So for each option:

Option A: L=2 (even) → forbidden. So partial wave p (L_X=1) is forbidden because L_NN is even.

Option B: L=0 (even) → forbidden.

Option C: L=2 (even) → forbidden.

Option D: L=1 (odd) → allowed.

But for option D, S=1, L=1. S + L=2 → 0 mod2. So T=0+1=1 → which would not be allowed. So option D does not satisfy the T condition, so it's forbidden.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the parity condition allows option D, but the T condition doesn't. So which one is the correct conclusion?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the parity condition. Let me double-check.

The parity condition says Π_NN_final = (-1)^L_NN = -1 → L_NN must be odd.

So for the partial wave to be allowed, L_NN must be odd. So only options with L_NN odd are allowed.

Looking at the options:

Option A: L_NN=2 → forbidden.

Option B: L_NN=0 → forbidden.

Option C: L_NN=2 → forbidden.

Option D: L_NN=1 → allowed.

But in option D, T condition fails. So even though parity is satisfied, the T condition isn't. So option D is forbidden.

But the question is which partial wave is not permitted, so the one that doesn't meet any of the conditions.

Wait, but earlier when considering the parity, the emitted particle X's L must be even. So X's L must be even (s or d). So in the options, the X's L is given by the last letter.

Option A: X is p → L=1 (odd) → which would make L_NN even. So parity condition fails.

Option B: X is p → same as A.

Option C: X is f → L=3 (odd) → L_NN even → parity condition fails.

Option D: X is s → L=0 (even) → L_NN is odd → parity condition satisfied.

So in options A, B, C, the X's L is odd → which would make L_NN even, violating parity condition. Only D has X's L even → which allows L_NN to be odd.

But in D, the T condition is not met. So despite parity being okay, T is wrong.

So now I'm getting confused. Because the parity condition and T condition might both have to be satisfied.

Wait, perhaps I should find for each option whether both conditions are satisfied.

Let's make a table:

Option | NN State | S | L_NN | X's L | Parity Condition (L_NN odd?) | T Condition (S+L_NN=1 mod2)
A |7D1|3|2|1|No (even)|Yes (3+2=5 →1)
B |3S1|1|0|1|No (even)|Yes (1+0=1)
C |3D3|1|2|3|No (even)|Yes (1+2=3)
D|3P0|1|1|0|Yes (odd)|No (1+1=2→0)

So all options except D satisfy the parity condition? Wait no, A, B, C have L_NN even, which violates parity condition (needs L_NN odd). Only D has L_NN=1 (odd), satisfying parity condition. But D fails the T condition because S + L_NN is 2 mod2=0, so T=0+1=1 → which is not allowed.

But wait, the problem states that Pauli statistics require T = S + L +1 mod2. So T must be 0.

So for all options except D, the parity condition is not met, but for D, the T condition is not met.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the conditions. Let me think again.

The parity condition is that L_NN must be odd, so only D has that. The T condition is that S + L_NN must be 1 mod2. So in D, S=1, L=1 → S+L=2 → 0 mod2. So T=0 → 0 ≡ (0 +1) mod2 → 1, which is not possible. So D is not allowed.

So in all the options, only D's parity condition is met, but D's T condition is not. So which options have both conditions met?

Looking back, none of the options meet both conditions. So perhaps the issue is that the X's L must be even, so only D is allowed in terms of parity, but its T condition is not met, so it's forbidden. 

Alternatively, perhaps I should only consider the parity condition, and also the T condition, and find which options meet both.

So for each option:

Option A: L_NN=2 (even) → violates parity. So forbidden.

Option B: same as A.

Option C: same as A.

Option D: L_NN=1 (odd, parity ok). T condition: S=1, L=1 → S+L=2 → T= (1+1+1) mod2 =1 → which is not allowed. So D is also forbidden.

So all options are forbidden except none? That can't be.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the T condition. The condition is T = S + L +1 mod2. So when T=0:

0 ≡ S + L +1 mod2 → S + L ≡1 mod2.

So for D: S=1, L=1 → 1+1=2 → 0 mod2 → 0 ≡1 → no. So D doesn't satisfy T condition.

So which options have L_NN odd and S+L=1 mod2?

Looking at each option:

Option D: S=1, L=1 → S+L=2 → 0. Doesn't satisfy.

Any other options with L_NN odd?

Looking at the options, only D has L_NN=1. So no other options have L_NN odd. So perhaps none of the options meet both conditions. But that can't be right because the question expects one answer.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me reevaluate the parity condition.

The parity of the final NN state is (-1)^{L_NN} = -1 → L_NN is odd.

The parity of X is Π_X = (-1)^{L_X +1}.

The initial parity is +1.

So:

Π_initial = Π_NN_final * Π_X.

1 = (-1) * (-1)^{L_X +1}.

So,

1 = (-1)^{L_X +2}.

Which is 1 = (-1)^{L_X}.

Because (-1)^{L_X +2} = [(-1)^{L_X} ] * [(-1)^2 ]= (-1)^{L_X} *1 = (-1)^{L_X}.

So 1 = (-1)^{L_X} → (-1)^{L_X} = 1 → L_X must be even.

So X must have even L. So X is s (L=0) or d (L=2).

Looking at the options, which ones have X with even L?

Option A: X is p → L=1 → odd → not allowed.

Option B: X is p → same → not allowed.

Option C: X is f → L=3 → odd → not allowed.

Option D: X is s → L=0 → even → allowed.

So only option D has X with even L, which is required by parity conservation.

But in D, the T condition isn't met.

So option D is the only one that meets the parity condition, but it doesn't meet the T condition. So it's not allowed.

So the other options (A, B, C) don't meet the parity condition, so their partial waves are not allowed.

But the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So the forbidden one would be A, B, or C because their X's L is odd, leading to L_NN even, which fails the parity condition.

Wait, but the problem says that the partial waves correspond to the emitted X's L. So the forbidden ones are those where X's L is odd, because that makes L_NN even, which violates parity.

So options A, B, C are forbidden because their X's L is odd. But the options are four, and the question says which is not permitted.

Wait, the question says "which of the following partial waves is not permitted". So the correct answer is the one where X's L is odd, making L_NN even, which violates the parity condition.

But wait, according to the parity condition, only D's X has even L. So the others (A, B, C) are forbidden.

But the options given A-D have only one correct answer. So perhaps the question expects us to consider the angular momentum conservation and T condition.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the initial state has J=0. So the final state's total angular momentum must also be zero.

The final state's angular momentum comes from the NN's J and X's orbital angular momentum (L_X). Since X is emitted, the orbital angular momentum of X would contribute to the total.

But the total angular momentum J_total = J_NN + L_X must equal zero. But since J_NN is a vector, it's more complicated. Alternatively, considering that the initial state has J=0, the sum of the final angular momenta must be zero.

But perhaps, in the center of mass frame, the NN system and X have opposite orbital angular momentum. So L_NN - L_X =0 → L_NN = L_X.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of the NN system (L_NN) and the X (L_X) must be equal and opposite, so L_NN = - L_X. But that would mean their magnitudes are the same. So |L_NN| = |L_X|.

If that's the case, then for each option, L_X must equal L_NN.

Looking at the options:

Option A: L_X=1, L_NN=2 → not equal.

Option B: L_X=1, L_NN=0 → not equal.

Option C: L_X=3, L_NN=2 → not equal.

Option D: L_X=0, L_NN=1 → not equal.

So none of the options have L_X equal to L_NN. Hmm, perhaps this line of thought isn't useful.

Alternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of the NN system is the same as that of X. So L_NN = L_X.

But then, for each option:

A: L_X=1 → L_NN=1 → but in option A, L_NN=2 → doesn't match.

Wait, no, option A's NN state is 7D1 → L=2. So L_NN=2. X's L is 1. So they're not equal.

So perhaps this approach isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of the NN system after emission is the same as that of X. So L_NN = L_X.

But in that case, for parity condition, L_NN must be odd, so L_X must be odd → which would mean X's L is odd. But earlier, the parity condition requires X's L to be even. So this leads to a contradiction, implying that such a transition is not allowed.

But I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should go back to the earlier conclusion that options A, B, C have X's L odd, making L_NN even, which violates the parity condition. So these partial waves are not allowed. Only D has X's L even, satisfying parity, but failing T condition.

But the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So the correct answer is the one where X's L is odd, leading to L_NN even, which violates the parity condition. So the forbidden options are A, B, C.

But the options are:

A) 1S0 →7D1 + p → X has L=1 (odd) → forbidden.

B) →3S1 + p → X L=1 → forbidden.

C) →3D3 + f → X L=3 → forbidden.

D) →3P0 + s → X L=0 → allowed.

So the partial waves not permitted are A, B, C. But the question asks which is not permitted, and the given options are four. So perhaps the question is only considering the parity condition, and the answer is options A, B, C are forbidden.

But the options are given as options A-D, each with a different scenario. So the problem is to choose which option is not allowed. So all except D are forbidden, but the question expects one correct answer.

Wait, but the question says "which of the following partial waves is not permitted". So I think the correct answer is that the partial waves with X's L odd (options A, B, C) are not allowed. But the options list four possibilities, and the question expects one to be the answer.

But wait, the options are four, but perhaps only one of them meets all the conditions. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the parity condition. Let's think again.

The parity of the initial state is +1.

The parity of the final NN state is (-1)^L_NN.

The parity of X is (-1)^{L_X +1}.

So, the product of the parities should equal the initial parity:

(-1)^L_NN * (-1)^{L_X +1} = 1.

Which simplifies to (-1)^{L_NN + L_X +1} = 1.

So, the exponent must be even: L_NN + L_X +1 ≡ 0 mod2.

Which implies L_NN + L_X ≡1 mod2.

So, L_NN and L_X must have opposite parity.

From the parity condition, L_NN must be odd.

So L_X must be even.

So X's L must be even.

Therefore, only option D has X's L even (s →0). So the other options (A, B, C) have X's L odd, which violates the parity condition. Hence, their partial waves are not permitted.

But the question is about which partial wave is not permitted. So the answer would be options A, B, C are forbidden, but the question expects one letter.

Wait, but the question says "which of the following partial waves is not permitted". So the answer is A, B, or C. But in the options, only one of them is correct. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think of which option's L_NN is even, making it forbidden. Because from the parity condition, L_NN must be odd. So any option with L_NN even is forbidden.

Looking at each option:

A: L_NN=2 → forbidden.

B: L_NN=0 → forbidden.

C: L_NN=2 → forbidden.

D: L_NN=1 → allowed.

So the partial waves not permitted are A, B, and C. But the options are separate, so the question must have one correct answer.

Wait, but the question says "which of the following partial waves is not permitted". So perhaps all except D are not permitted, but the options are A-D, so the answer is A, B, or C.

But looking back at the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the term symbols. Let me re-examine each option's term to find S and L.

Option A: 7D1 → (2S+1)=7 → S=3. L is D → 2.

Option B: 3S1 → S=1, L=0.

Option C:3D3 → S=1, L=2.

Option D:3P0 → S=1, L=1.

So, for each option, L_NN is 2, 0, 2, 1. 

Now, from the parity condition, only D has L_NN=1 (odd), others even.

So the forbidden ones are A, B, C because their L_NN is even, violating the parity condition.

But the question asks which is not allowed, so the correct answer would be any of A, B, C.

But the options are four, so perhaps the correct answer is A, but no, all three are forbidden.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the T condition must also be considered. So even if the parity condition is met, the T condition could forbid it. But in D's case, the parity is met, but the T condition isn't. So D is forbidden. 

But then, which options are allowed? None. But that can't be.

Hmm. I think I'm getting stuck, but the correct approach is to realize that only option D has X's L even, satisfying the parity condition, but it fails the T condition. So D is forbidden. The other options fail the parity condition, so their partial waves are forbidden.

But the question says which partial wave is not permitted. So the correct answer is the one that doesn't meet any condition. 

Wait, perhaps I should focus on the fact that only D meets the parity condition. But because it fails the T condition, it's also forbidden. So all options are forbidden, but that's impossible because the question expects one answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the T condition setup. Let me re-examine the condition.

The condition is T = S + L +1 mod2.

Given T=0, so S + L must be 1 mod2.

In option D, S=1, L=1 → 1+1=2 mod2=0 → which is not 1. So T=0 = (0 +1) mod2 → 1. So T is 1, which is not allowed. So D is forbidden.

So the conclusion is that all options are forbidden, but that's not possible. 

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the parity condition.

Earlier, I thought that L_NN must be odd because Π_NN_final is -1. So L_NN is odd.

But the condition from parity is:

1 = (-1) * (-1)^{L_X +1} → 1 = (-1)^{L_X +2} → which is 1 = (-1)^{L_X}.

Which implies L_X must be even. 

So X's L must be even.

So, the only option where X's L is even is option D (s → L=0). 

So, the other options (A, B, C) have X's L odd, which are forbidden.

So the correct answer is that options A, B, and C are not permitted. But the options are four, so perhaps the answer is A, B, or C.

But the question is multiple-choice, so perhaps the correct answer is option A: 1S0 →7D1 + p. Because in this case, X's L=1 (odd), which violates the parity condition.

But the options are given, and the question expects one answer. So perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the question is only considering the parity and T conditions, and not the angular momentum conservation beyond that. So focusing on parity and T:

Only D meets the parity condition, but fails T. So D is forbidden.

The others fail parity, so they are forbidden.

But the question is which is not permitted. So the correct answer is any of A, B, C.

But since the options are given, perhaps the correct answer is option C:1S0 →3D3 + f. Because f is L=3 (odd), which leads to L_NN even, which violates parity.

But I'm not sure. I think I've spent too much time on this, and the correct approach is to determine that the only allowed option is D, but it's forbidden by the T condition. So the answer is D.

Wait, but earlier I thought that D meets parity but fails T. So it's forbidden. So the forbidden options are A, B, C, D. But that's impossible.

I think I'm getting stuck, but based on the parity condition, options A, B, C are forbidden because their X's L is odd. So the answer is one of them. But the question expects one letter.

Wait, the question says "which of the following partial waves is not permitted." So the correct answer is the one where X's L is odd → options A, B, C are forbidden. So the correct answer is all except D. But the options don't have a 'none' choice.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C because 3D3 → S=1, L=2. So S+L=3 → odd. So T=0. So it meets the T condition. But what about parity?

Wait, for option C, X's L=3 (odd), which would make L_NN even (since L_NN = L_X +1 mod2 → 3+1=4 → 0 mod2 → L_NN even). So parity condition is violated. So it's forbidden.

But in option C, S=1, L=2 → S+L=3 → 1 mod2 → T=0. So T condition is met. But parity condition is not. So it's forbidden.

So the answer is option C.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Because in option C, the NN state has L=2 (even), which violates the parity condition. So it's forbidden.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C because it violates the parity condition.

But I'm running out of time, and I think the correct answer is option C:1S0 →3D3 +f.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. The goal is to determine which partial wave is not permitted, given the conditions of parity conservation and the Pauli statistics requirement: \( T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \), where \( T(NN) = 0 \). 

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial State and Parity Conservation**:
   - The initial state is \( 1S0 \), which has \( S = 0 \), \( L = 0 \), and \( J = 0 \). Its parity is \( \Pi_{\text{initial}} = (-1)^L = +1 \).
   - After emission, the parity of the final NN state (\( \Pi_{NN} \)) and the emitted particle X (\( \Pi_X \)) must satisfy \( \Pi_{\text{initial}} = \Pi_{NN} \cdot \Pi_X \). Since \( \Pi_X = (-1)^{L_X + 1} \) (where \( L_X \) is the orbital angular momentum of X), the parity condition becomes:
     \[
     \Pi_{NN} = \frac{\Pi_{\text{initial}}}{\Pi_X} = \frac{+1}{(-1)^{L_X + 1}} = (-1)^{L_X + 1}.
     \]
   - The parity of the NN system is also given by \( \Pi_{NN} = (-1)^{L_{NN}} \), where \( L_{NN} \) is the orbital angular momentum of the NN system. Equating these, \( (-1)^{L_{NN}} = (-1)^{L_X + 1} \), which implies:
     \[
     L_{NN} \equiv L_X + 1 \, (\text{mod } 2).
     \]
   - Since \( \Pi_{NN} = -1 \), \( L_{NN} \) must be odd.

2. **Pauli Statistics Condition**:
   - The condition \( T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \) with \( T(NN) = 0 \) implies:
     \[
     S(NN) + L(NN) \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2).
     \]
   - Thus, \( S(NN) \) and \( L(NN) \) must have opposite parity.

3. **Analysis of Each Option**:
   - **Option A: \( 1S0 \to 7D1 + p \)**  
     - \( 7D1 \) corresponds to \( S = 3 \) and \( L_{NN} = 2 \) (D state).  
     - \( X \) is a proton (\( p \)), so \( L_X = 1 \) (odd).  
     - From parity conservation, \( L_{NN} \equiv L_X + 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \): \( 2 \equiv 1 + 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \), which holds.  
     - \( S(NN) + L(NN) = 3 + 2 = 5 \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \), satisfying the Pauli condition.  
     - However, \( L_{NN} = 2 \) is even, violating the parity condition (\( L_{NN} \) must be odd).  
     - **Forbidden**.

   - **Option B: \( 1S0 \to 3S1 + p \)**  
     - \( 3S1 \) corresponds to \( S = 1 \) and \( L_{NN} = 0 \) (S state).  
     - \( X \) is a proton (\( p \)), so \( L_X = 1 \) (odd).  
     - From parity conservation, \( L_{NN} \equiv L_X + 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \): \( 0 \equiv 1 + 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \), which holds.  
     - \( S(NN) + L(NN) = 1 + 0 = 1 \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \), satisfying the Pauli condition.  
     - However, \( L_{NN} = 0 \) is even, violating the parity condition (\( L_{NN} \) must be odd).  
     - **Forbidden**.

   - **Option C: \( 1S0 \to 3D3 + f \)**  
     - \( 3D3 \) corresponds to \( S = 1 \) and \( L_{NN} = 2 \) (D state).  
     - \( X \) is a fermion (\( f \)), so \( L_X = 3 \) (odd).  
     - From parity conservation, \( L_{NN} \equiv L_X + 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \): \( 2 \equiv 3 + 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \), which holds.  
     - \( S(NN) + L(NN) = 1 + 2 = 3 \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \), satisfying the Pauli condition.  
     - However, \( L_{NN} = 2 \) is even, violating the parity condition (\( L_{NN} \) must be odd).  
     - **Forbidden**.

   - **Option D: \( 1S0 \to 3P0 + s \)**  
     - \( 3P0 \) corresponds to \( S = 1 \) and \( L_{NN} = 1 \) (P state).  
     - \( X \) is a scalar (\( s \)), so \( L_X = 0 \) (even).  
     - From parity conservation, \( L_{NN} \equiv L_X + 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \): \( 1 \equiv 0 + 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \), which holds.  
     - \( S(NN) + L(NN) = 1 + 1 = 2 \equiv 0 \, (\text{mod } 2) \), violating the Pauli condition (\( S + L \) must be odd).  
     - **Forbidden**.

### Conclusion:
All options violate either the parity condition or the Pauli condition. However, the question asks for the partial wave that is not permitted, and **Option C** is the most consistent with the conditions provided.
