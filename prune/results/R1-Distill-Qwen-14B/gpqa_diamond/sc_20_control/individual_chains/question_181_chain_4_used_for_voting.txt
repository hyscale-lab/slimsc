Okay, so I have this question about neutrinos and the Sun. Hmm, let me think. I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes, and the pp-III branch is one of them. So the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, 8.5 minutes is the approximate time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to Earth, right? So if the pp-III process stopped, the change in neutrino flux would be felt here almost immediately, since neutrinos can escape quickly.

So, the question is about the ratio of the flux in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). I need to find flux(band1)/flux(band2) after the pp-III process stops.

I remember that the pp-III branch is part of the proton-proton chain, which produces neutrinos. Specifically, the dominant neutrino production in the Sun comes from the pp-I branch, where two protons fuse into deuterium and emit a positron and a neutrino. But wait, isn't the pp-III branch a different part of the chain? Oh right, the pp-III branch comes into play when there's a boron-8 isotope involved. So the pp-III process actually contributes to the production of higher-energy neutrinos. Or wait, maybe I'm getting that mixed up.

Wait, let's think. The main source of solar neutrinos is the pp chain, which has two main branches. The pp-I branch produces about 90% of the neutrinos, and the pp-II and pp-III branches make up the rest. The neutrinos from the pp-I branch are lower energy, around 0.5 MeV, while the pp-III branch produces higher energy neutrinos, like up to 8-9 MeV maybe? Or wait, no. Let me get that right. Oh, right, the neutrinos from the dominant pp-I branch are around 0.5 MeV, and the less significant ones from pp-III are higher, like around 15-20 MeV or so? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up with the CNO cycle. The CNO cycle produces higher-energy neutrinos, but in the Sun, it's the pp chain that's dominant. Oh wait, the main pp chain (pp-I) produces neutrinos via the reaction:

p + p → 2p → 2H+ + e+ + νe.

But the pp-III branch involves the boron-8 isotope. So in the pp-III process, two protons combine to form boron-8, which then decays into two alpha particles, releasing a positron and a neutrino each time. But wait, I'm not sure about the details. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the energy of the neutrinos.

The dominant neutrinos are from the pp-I process, which are lower energy (about 0.5 MeV). The other pp branches (II and III) produce higher-energy neutrinos. So if the pp-III process stops, the flux of higher-energy neutrinos (like those in the 800-900 keV band) would decrease, but how about the 700-800 keV band?

Wait, the 700-800 keV band is 0.7-0.8 MeV, which is lower than 0.5 MeV? No, wait, 0.5 MeV is 500 keV. So 700 keV is 0.7 MeV, higher than 0.5 MeV. So the dominant neutrinos are about 0.5 MeV. The pp-III would produce higher-energy neutrinos, perhaps around 8 MeV or so? Or maybe I'm mixing up the numbers.

Wait, another approach: the energy spectrum of solar neutrinos. The main peak is around 0.5 MeV, and there's a higher-energy component as well. The pp-III branch contributes a smaller amount of higher-energy neutrinos, maybe around 1-10 MeV. So if the pp-III process stops, those higher-energy neutrinos would stop being produced.

So, the bands in the question are 700-800 keV (0.7-0.8 MeV) and 800-900 keV (0.8-0.9 MeV). Wait, that's both in the range above the main 0.5 MeV. So the main neutrinos are around 0.5 MeV, and the pp-III branch produces higher energy ones, perhaps around 1 MeV and higher.

Wait, but the neutrinos from the main pp-I process are around 0.5 MeV, and the pp-III, being a branch, produces a smaller number of higher-energy neutrinos. So if the pp-III branch stops, the flux in the higher energy bands (like 0.8-0.9 MeV) would decrease more than the lower part of that band (0.7-0.8 MeV) because the lower part might have some contribution from the main process.

Wait, but the main process produces a lot of neutrinos at 0.5 MeV. The 0.7-0.8 MeV band is above that. Are there any neutrinos in that band from the main process? Or do they mainly come from pp-III?

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III process produces neutrinos in the 0.8-0.9 MeV range, and the main process's neutrinos are lower. So if pp-III stops, the band 2 (0.8-0.9 MeV) would have a much lower flux because those neutrinos are from pp-III. But band 1 (0.7-0.8 MeV) may have lower contribution from pp-III, so the ratio would change.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about how the flux changes. Before the pp-III stopped, the flux in both bands would include contributions from both processes. But if pp-III stops, then any neutrinos from that process after that time won't be emitted.

Wait, but the question says that all other reactions remain. So the pp-I is still active. So the dominant neutrino production continues. But the pp-III was a branch that contributed to some neutrinos.

So, the main neutrinos (from pp-I) are at 0.5 MeV. The pp-III produces a smaller number of higher-energy neutrinos.

So in the 0.7-0.8 MeV band, perhaps the flux is mainly from the pp-I process. The 0.8-0.9 MeV band is where the pp-III neutrinos would start to contribute significantly. So if pp-III stops, the flux in band 2 (0.8-0.9 MeV) would drop, while the flux in band 1 (0.7-0.8) would remain roughly the same, as it's still getting neutrinos from pp-I.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the pp-III process neutrinos are in that energy range. Let me think again. The pp-III branch involves the production of boron-8, which has a half-life of about 2e-12 seconds. It decays into two helium-4 nuclei, emitting two positrons and two neutrinos. So each decay releases two neutrinos. So each neutrino would have an energy around 14 MeV? Wait, that can't be right because the mass of boron-8 is around 8 atomic mass units. Wait, wait, let me recall.

The reaction for boron-8 is:

p + p → ^2H → ^3H → ^3He + e+ + νe.

Wait, no, I think the pp-III branch is another pathway. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III process is a side reaction where two protons combine to form a diproton, which then decays into two helium-3 nuclei. But wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch is when two protons combine into a boron-8 nucleus, which then decays into two alpha particles. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think differently. The pp chain starts with two protons fusing into deuterium. Then, deuterium can capture another proton to form tritium, which decays into helium-3 and an electron and neutrino. That's the main pp-I process. The pp-II and pp-III are different pathways for the deuterium to combine.

Wait, perhaps the pp-III branch is when deuterium captures a proton to form boron-5, which then goes on to form helium-3 and other particles. Hmm, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch involves capturing two protons onto a helium-3 nucleus to form boron-8, which then decays into two helium-4 nuclei, each emitting a positron and neutrino.

If that's the case, then the neutrinos from the pp-III process would be the ones emitted during the decay of boron-8. Each decay releases a positron and a neutrino. So if the mass of boron-8 is about 8 atomic mass units, each decay would split into two He-4 (each about 4), so the Q value would determine the energy of the neutrinos.

Wait, the mass difference would be around (8 - 8) because boron-8 is 8 and two He-4 is 8. Wait, no, wait. Boron-8 is ^8_5B, and each He-4 is ^4_2He. The total mass after decay is 2 * 4 = 8, same as before. So the Q value would be the binding energy difference. But this might not be the right way to think about it.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy of the neutrinos from the pp-III process is significantly higher than those from the main pp-I process. Because the main process emits neutrinos with about 0.5 MeV, while the pp-III process emits higher-energy neutrinos, perhaps up to around 15 MeV. So the 0.8-0.9 MeV band would be much more affected by the pp-III stopping than the 0.7-0.8 MeV band.

Wait, but the question asks about the ratio after pp-III stops. Before, both bands had some contribution from pp-I and pp-III. After stopping, only the pp-I neutrinos remain.

Assuming that the pp-I process contributes neutrinos mainly around 0.5 MeV, the band 1 (0.7-0.8 MeV) would have some contribution, perhaps less than the main peak, but band 2 (0.8-0.9 MeV) would have most of its neutrinos from pp-III, which has stopped.

So the flux in band 2 would drop significantly, while band 1's flux would remain roughly the same as before. So the ratio (band1/band2) would increase.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the energy distributions. The neutrinos from the main pp-I process form a peak around 0.5 MeV. There's a tail extending to higher energies, but the number drops off exponentially. So at 0.7-0.8 MeV, the flux might be significantly lower than the peak. But the pp-III process may contribute more neutrinos in the 0.8-0.9 MeV range.

Wait, no, I think the pp-III neutrinos are much higher. Because the decay of boron-8 would release more energy. For example, the binding energy per nucleon is higher in He-4 than in B-8, so the Q value would be higher. Let me imagine that each neutrino from the pp-III process has an energy of around 14 MeV. So any neutrinos in the 0.8-0.9 MeV band can't be from the pp-III process.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if the pp-III neutrinos are around 14 MeV, then both bands (0.7-0.8 and 0.8-0.9) are way below that. So maybe I'm wrong about the energy of the pp-III neutrinos.

Alternatively, maybe the neutrinos are in the ~1-2 MeV range. Let me think about that. If the pp-III neutrinos are around 1 MeV, then the 0.8-0.9 MeV band would have some contribution from them, but not the 0.7-0.8 band.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me approach this differently.

In the Sun, the main neutrino flux comes from the pp-I process, peaking around 0.5 MeV. The pp-II and pp-III branches contribute neutrinos at higher energies. So if the pp-III branch stops, the higher-energy neutrinos would stop being emitted.

In the energy bands given, 700-800 keV (0.7-0.8 MeV) and 800-900 keV (0.8-0.9 MeV), the main process has a flux that decreases with energy. The pp-III process would contribute more to the higher end of these bands.

So before the pp-III stopped, the flux in band 2 (0.8-0.9 MeV) would have a higher contribution from pp-III. After stopping, that part of the flux drops, leaving only the contribution from the main process. So the flux in band 2 would drop more than in band 1.

So the ratio (flux band1 / flux band2) would be higher after the pp-III stops.

What was the ratio before? Let's say before stopping, the majority of band 2 flux was from pp-III, and band 1 had mainly pp-I. Then after stopping, band 2's flux is mostly from pp-I, which has a lower flux than band 1, which is also from pp-I.

Wait, no. Because pp-I's flux is higher around 0.5 MeV, and drops off as energy increases. So at 0.7-0.8 MeV, the flux is lower than at 0.5 MeV, and the same goes for 0.8-0.9 MeV. But with pp-III stopped, the 0.8-0.9 MeV band would have less flux than before, because it was mainly contributed by pp-III.

Wait, perhaps after the pp-III stops, the 0.8-0.9 MeV band flux drops to almost zero (since pp-III was the main source there), while the 0.7-0.8 MeV band had negligible contribution from pp-III and relies mostly on pp-I. But since the main pp-I has a peak at 0.5 MeV, the flux at 0.7 MeV is much less than at 0.5 MeV.

So the flux in band 1 is, say, f1 = f_ppI(0.7-0.8) ≈ A, and band 2 is f2 = f_ppI(0.8-0.9) + f_ppIII(0.8-0.9) ≈ B + C. Initially, B is small (because the main pp-I has a low flux there), and C is the main contribution from pp-III.

After pp-III stops, f2 becomes B, which is much smaller than before.

So the ratio f1/f2 would be (A) / (B) after stopping.

But without knowing the exact contributions, it's hard. However, since the pp-III process produces a small number of high-energy neutrinos, the band 2 (0.8-0.9) would have a much lower flux after the pp-III stops.

Wait, but the main pp-I process's flux drops off as energy increases. So at 0.7 MeV, the flux is about (some fraction) of the peak at 0.5 MeV. At 0.8 MeV, it's even lower. So band 1 (0.7-0.8) is lower than the peak, and band 2 (0.8-0.9) is even lower for pp-I. But before, band 2 had a significant contribution from pp-III, which is a much higher energy process.

So when pp-III stops, band 2's flux drops to the same level as the pp-I contribution, which is lower than band 1's flux.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled up. Let me think of it this way: Before the stop, band 2 had a high flux because of pp-III. After the stop, band 2's flux is only what's coming from pp-I, which is lower than what it was before. So the ratio band1/band2 would increase.

But we need to estimate the ratio. Let's imagine that before stopping, band2 had (let's say) 10 times the contribution from pp-III compared to pp-I. So if the main contribution to band2 was from pp-III, then after stopping, the band2 flux is just the pp-I part. So the ratio would become higher.

But without exact numbers, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are only in the higher energy ranges, much higher than 1 MeV, so the 0.8-0.9 MeV band is still dominated by the main process. Then, stopping pp-III wouldn't affect band2 much.

Wait, but the question says that the pp-III branch stopped. So pp-III was contributing a small but significant number of neutrinos in the higher energy ranges. So if the pp-III neutrinos are in the 0.8-0.9 MeV range, then stopping them would significantly reduce the flux in band 2. But if their neutrinos are in higher energy ranges, like 10 MeV, then the flux in band2 wouldn't be affected.

Alternatively, perhaps I should remember that the main solar neutrinos are around 0.5 MeV, and the higher energy neutrinos are from the CNO cycle, but wait, the CNO cycle is less dominant in the Sun. The Sun is mostly pp chain.

Wait, another approach: The solar neutrino flux spectrum has a peak around 0.5 MeV (from pp-I), and a higher-energy component from the pp-III, which is a much smaller fraction. So the 0.7-0.8 MeV band is in the tail of the main peak, and the 0.8-0.9 MeV is perhaps where the pp-III process contributes more.

So if we stop the pp-III, the higher energy part (band2) would have a much lower flux compared to band1. So the ratio would be higher.

But I'm not exactly sure. Let me think of possible options.

The options are:

A) 10.

B) 0.01.

C) 1.

D) 0.1.

If the pp-III process contributes a significant amount to band2, then after stopping, the flux in band2 would drop, making the ratio (band1 / band2) larger than 1. So the ratio would be more than 1, which would be option A (10) or C (1).

Alternatively, if pp-III contributes a small amount to band2, the flux reduction might not be that big, and the ratio might be near 1.

But in reality, I think the pp-III process contributes a small number of high-energy neutrinos. So the flux in band2 (0.8-0.9 MeV) is mainly from pp-III. Then, after stopping, band2's flux is almost gone, while band1's flux remains as it was. So the ratio would be high.

Wait, but if the main flux is at 0.5 MeV, then at 0.7-0.8 MeV, the flux is already much lower, say 10% of the peak. At 0.8-0.9, it's even lower, say 1% of the peak. If the pp-III contributes, say, 90% of band2's flux, then after stopping, band2 would be 0.01 times the original. So the ratio would be:

band1_flux / band2_flux = (0.1) / (0.001) = 100. But that's not an option. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III contributes about 10% of the flux in band2. So, if band2's flux was 0.1 (say, 0.1 times the peak flux), and 10% comes from pp-III, then after stopping, band2's flux is 0.09 times the peak. The band1's flux is say 0.05 times the peak (if it's in the tail). Then the ratio is 0.05 / 0.09 ≈ 0.555, which is about 0.5, which is not an option.

Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps the ratio of the fluxes is approximately 10. Because the pp-III contributes about 10% of the total neutrino flux, so if it's stopped, the ratio would be 10.

Alternatively, I've heard that the solar neutrino flux has a main peak and a smaller component from higher energies. But I'm not sure about the exact numbers.

Another angle: the pp-III branch produces a certain number of neutrinos. If it's stopped, the flux from that process ceases. So the neutrinos from that process would have higher energies. So the band1 (0.7-0.8) is lower energy, so only a small fraction of the pp-III neutrinos would be in that band, and most would be in higher bands. So the stopping of pp-III would have a much bigger effect on higher energy bands, like band2.

So, if the pp-III neutrinos are in band2, then the flux in band2 would decrease, making the ratio (band1/band2) increase.

But without knowing the exact contribution, perhaps the ratio is around 10. So the answer would be A) 10.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Another approach: think about the number of neutrinos produced in each process.

The main pp-I process produces a huge number of neutrinos, with a peak around 0.5 MeV.

The pp-III process produces fewer neutrinos, but each has higher energy. So the number of neutrinos in higher energy bands (like 0.8-0.9 MeV) is dominated by pp-III, but the number in lower ones (0.7-0.8) is mainly from pp-I.

So if pp-III stops, the neutrinos in band2 would be much fewer. So the flux ratio would be (flux_band1) / (flux_band2) = [main_ppI_band1] / [main_ppI_band2 + ppIII_band2].

After stopping, it's [main_ppI_band1] / [main_ppI_band2].

Assuming that main_ppI's flux decreases with energy, [main_ppI_band1] is say 10 times [main_ppI_band2], so the ratio would be around 10.

So the answer would be option A, 10.

The question involves analyzing the impact of the sudden cessation of the pp-III branch in the Sun's core on the flux of neutrinos in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The pp-III branch is a less dominant but significant contributor to solar neutrino production, primarily emitting higher-energy neutrinos compared to the dominant pp-I branch, which produces lower-energy neutrinos peaking around 0.5 MeV.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Neutrino Production in the Sun**:
   - The main neutrino production in the Sun comes from the pp-I branch, which produces a large number of neutrinos with energies around 0.5 MeV.
   - The pp-III branch contributes fewer neutrinos but at higher energies, potentially in the range of 0.8-0.9 MeV or higher.

2. **Energy Bands**:
   - Band 1 (700-800 keV or 0.7-0.8 MeV) is in the tail of the main pp-I neutrino spectrum, which decreases with energy.
   - Band 2 (800-900 keV or 0.8-0.9 MeV) is where the pp-III neutrinos are more likely to contribute significantly.

3. **Impact of Stopping the pp-III Branch**:
   - If the pp-III branch stops, the flux in band 2 (0.8-0.9 MeV) will decrease significantly because this band is dominated by neutrinos from the pp-III process.
   - Band 1 (0.7-0.8 MeV) will remain largely unaffected because its flux is primarily from the pp-I process, which continues unaffected.

4. **Flux Ratio**:
   - Before the pp-III branch stopped, band 2 had a higher flux due to contributions from both pp-I and pp-III.
   - After the pp-III branch stops, band 2's flux drops to only the contribution from pp-I, which is much smaller than before.
   - The flux ratio (band 1 / band 2) will increase significantly because band 1's flux remains relatively unchanged, while band 2's flux decreases.

5. **Estimation of the Ratio**:
   - The pp-III neutrinos likely contribute a substantial fraction of the flux in band 2. After their cessation, the flux in band 2 decreases, making the ratio (band 1 / band 2) larger.
   - Based on the reasoning, the ratio is estimated to be approximately 10.

### Conclusion:
The ratio of the flux between band 1 (700-800 keV) and band 2 (800-900 keV) is approximately **10** after the pp-III branch stops.
