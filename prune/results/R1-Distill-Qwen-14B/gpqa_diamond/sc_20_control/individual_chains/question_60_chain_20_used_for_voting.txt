Okay, so I have this physics problem here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, let me think through it step by step. So, the question is about an alien spacecraft traveling at a very high speed, 0.99999987 times the speed of light. They're trying to get to Earth, and the astronaut is 22 years old. I need to find out how long the trip takes from the astronaut's perspective, right?

Wait, I remember that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs. Time dilation is part of Einstein's theory of relativity. So, from the perspective of someone on Earth, time would pass normally, but from the perspective of the astronaut, time would be experienced more slowly. Or wait, no, wait. No, actually, the astronaut's own time would be their proper time, which is shorter than the time measured by someone else in a different inertial frame, like Earth. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no, no. Proper time is the time experienced by the traveler. So, if the spacecraft is moving relative to Earth, the Earth observer would see the spacecraft's time as dilated, meaning slower. So, from Earth's point of view, the trip would take a lot longer, but from the astronaut's perspective, things are different.

Wait, but the question is asking from the astronaut's point of view. So, I need to calculate the proper time for the trip. Proper time is calculated using the Lorentz transformation formula, right?

The formula for time dilation is the Lorentz factor gamma, which is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So, gamma equals 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Then, the proper time tau (τ) is equal to the Earth time multiplied by sqrt(1 - v²/c²), or equivalently, the Earth time is gamma times the proper time. So, since the question is about the astronaut's proper time, I need to find how much Earth time passes, then multiply by sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) to get the astronaut's time.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, from Earth's perspective, the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud is a certain amount. Let me think, what's the distance between the LMC and Earth? I think the LMC is about 160,000 to 170,000 light-years away. Oh wait, but the problem says the astronauts are from the LMC and are traveling to Earth, so the distance is about 160,000 light-years. So, from Earth's perspective, the spacecraft is traveling at 0.99999987c, so the time taken would be distance divided by speed.

But let me calculate that. So, distance D = 163,000 light-years (I'll approximate it as 163,000 for calculation). Speed v = 0.99999987c. So, Earth time is D / v = (163,000 ly) / (0.99999987c). Since 1 ly is the distance light travels in a year, when you divide by c, the units work out to years.

So, let me compute that. 163,000 / 0.99999987 is approximately equal to 163,000 * (1 / 0.99999987). Let me approximate 1/0.99999987 as about 1.00000013, since (1-0.99999987)=0.00000013, so 1/(1 - e) ≈ 1 + e for small e. So, 163,000 * 1.00000013 is approximately 163,000 + (163,000 * 1.3e-6) = 163,000 + 0.2119 ≈ 163,000.212 years.

Wait, but that seems like a long time. So, Earth time is about 163,000 years. But wait, wait, the LMC is about 160,000 light-years away, so the distance is about 160,000 ly, perhaps a bit more. So, maybe I should use 160,000 as the distance.

So, D = 160,000 ly. Then, Earth time is 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ 160,000 + (160,000 * 1.3e-6) = 160,000 + 0.208 ≈ 160,000.208 years.

So, from Earth's perspective, the trip takes about 160,000 years. But from the astronaut's perspective, their own time is shorter. So, their proper time would be Earth time multiplied by sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2).

Wait, let's compute gamma first. v = 0.99999987c.

v²/c² = (0.99999987)^2. Let me compute that. (0.99999987)^2 = approximately 0.99999974. So, 1 - v²/c² ≈ 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026. So, sqrt(0.00000026) = sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 5.1e-4 (since sqrt(2.5e-7) is about 5e-4). Let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 5e-4 squared is 2.5e-7, so yes, sqrt(2.6e-7) is approximately 5.099e-4. Let me compute sqrt(2.6e-7):

Let me compute 5.1e-4 squared: (5.1e-4)^2 = 26.01e-8 = 2.601e-7, which is very close to 2.6e-7. So, sqrt(2.6e-7)= approximately 5.1e-4.

So, sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ 0.0005099.

So, the proper time tau is Earth_time * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 160,000 * 0.0005099 ≈ 160,000 * 0.00051 ≈ 81.6 years.

Wait, that's about 81.6 years. So, the astronaut's own time is about 81.6 years. But wait, the astronaut is 22 years old. So, adding 81 years would make him 103 years old. But wait, the average lifetime of these aliens is 150 solar years. So, 103 is within that range. So, the astronaut would live long enough to reach Earth.

But wait, the options don't have 81.6 as an option, but option C is 81 years. So, that would make sense. So, the correct answer would be C) 81 years.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let me go through the calculations again.

First, compute gamma: gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.00000026) = 1 / (5.099e-4) ≈ 1960. So, gamma is about 1960. That makes sense because v is very close to c, so gamma is large.

From Earth's perspective, the time is D/v = 160,000 ly / (0.99999987c) = (160,000 / 0.99999987) years ≈ 160,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ 160,000 + (160,000 * 1.3e-6) ≈ 160,000 + 0.208 ≈ 160,000.208 years.

So, Earth time is about 160,000 years. The astronaut's time is tau = Earth_time / gamma = 160,000 / 1960 ≈ 81.57 years. So, approximately 81.6 years. So, the astronaut's age upon arrival would be 22 + 81.6 = 103.6 years, which is less than their average lifetime of 150 years. So, they'd survive the trip.

But wait, let me think again. The initial approach: from the astronaut's perspective, the distance is contracted. Because in their frame, the Earth is moving towards them at velocity v, so the distance is Lorentz-contracted. So, the proper length L0 is the Earth's frame length; the astronaut's frame would see a contracted length L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2).

Wait, so the time experienced by the astronaut is the distance in their frame divided by speed. So, their time tau = (L0 * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)) / v. Which is the same as (L0 / v) * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = (Earth_time) * sqrt(...). So, same as before.

So, the correct calculation is that the astronaut's time is around 81 years. So, the correct answer is option C, 81 years.

Wait, but let me check the numbers again, because 0.99999987c is 0.99999987 of the speed of light, so that's extremely close to c. So, gamma would be huge. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

v = 0.99999987c

v²/c² = (0.99999987)^2 = let's compute that exactly.

0.99999987 squared is approximately (1 - 1.3e-6)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*(1.3e-6) + (1.3e-6)^2. So, 1 - 2.6e-6 + 1.69e-12 ≈ 0.99999974.

So, 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026.

So, sqrt(0.00000026) ≈ 5.099e-4.

So, gamma is 1/(5.099e-4) ≈ 1960. So, gamma = 1960.

Wait, so Earth time is 160,000 years. Then, tau = 160,000 / gamma = 160,000 / 1960 ≈ 81.6 years.

So, the astronaut's time is about 81.6 years. So, the options are:

A) Astronaut dies before reaching Earth. No, because 81 years added to 22 would be 103, and their average is 150, so they'd survive.

B) 72 years: Hmm, that's lower than my calculation. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the distance. Let me think: what's the actual distance to the LMC? I thought it's about 160,000 light-years, but perhaps I should check. Wait, according to my knowledge, the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 170,000 light-years away. So, perhaps I should use 170,000 ly.

Let me recalculate with D = 170,000 ly.

So, Earth time is D/v = 170,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 170,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ 170,000 + (170,000 * 1.3e-6) ≈ 170,000 + 0.221 ≈ 170,002.21 years.

Tau = 170,000 / gamma = 170,000 / 1960 ≈ 86.73 years. Hmm, that's about 87 years, which is not exactly matching any of the options. Wait, but the options are 72, 77, 81, etc.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, maybe the problem is using a different distance.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to approximate the distance as 100,000 light-years? Because 170,000 ly might be considered too far, but perhaps the problem simplifies it. Or maybe the problem is just expecting a calculation based on v and not the actual distance, assuming that the distance is 1 light-year? But that can't be, because the options are in the tens of years, and the spaceship is going at 0.99999987c.

Wait, if the distance were 1 light-year, then the Earth time would be 1 / 0.99999987 ≈ 1.00000013 years. The astronaut's time would be 1.00000013 * sqrt(0.00000026) ≈ 1.00000013 * 5.099e-4 ≈ 0.00051 years, which is about 18.5 days. That's way less than the options given, so the problem must be considering a distance of 160,000 ly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in using the Earth's frame distance. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the time from the astronaut's perspective without considering Earth's frame. Let me re-express the problem.

Wait, the question is: How long will it take for their 22 years old astronaut to reach Earth using this incredibly fast spacecraft? From the astronaut's perspective.

So, the proper time for the astronaut is the time experienced during the trip. So, from their frame, the Earth is approaching them at speed v, so the distance is Lorentz-contracted.

Lorentz contraction is L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where L0 is the proper length (Earth's frame length).

So, the time experienced by the astronaut, tau, is L / v = (L0 * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)) / v. Which is the same as (L0 / v ) * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = (Earth time) * sqrt(...), which is the same as before.

So, the calculation should be correct.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects me to compute the time without considering the actual distance. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question, and the answer is that the astronaut dies before reaching because the trip takes longer than their lifetime. Hmm, but in that case, the proper time would have to be longer than their lifespan.

Wait, the astronaut is 22, and their average lifetime is 150 years, so they have about 128 years left. If the trip takes 81 years, they would reach Earth at 22 + 81 = 103 years, which is within their expected lifespan. So, they would survive.

So, the correct answer would be option C, 81 years.

Wait, but let me think again. The options are:

A) Astronaut will die before reaching Earth.

B) 72 years

C) 81 years

D) 77 years

So, our calculation is about 81.6 years, so option C is the closest.

But wait, perhaps I should recalculate using more precise numbers.

Let me compute gamma again. v = 0.99999987c.

v^2 = (0.99999987)^2 = 0.99999974000001 (exact calculation: 0.99999987 * 0.99999987.

Let me compute 0.99999987 * 0.99999987:

(1 - 0.00000013)^2 = 1 - 2*(0.00000013) + (0.00000013)^2 = 1 - 0.00000026 + 1.69e-12 ≈ 0.9999997400000169.

So, 1 - v^2/c^2 is 1 - 0.9999997400000169 = 0.0000002599999831.

So, sqrt(0.0000002599999831) = approximately 0.00050995.

So, gamma = 1 / 0.00050995 ≈ 1960.113.

Now, the proper time tau = D/(v * gamma).

Wait, because tau = (D / v) * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = D/(v gamma^{-1}) ) * sqrt(...). Hmm, perhaps another approach.

Wait, I think I'm getting a bit stuck in the weeds. Let's just proceed with the precise calculation.

If D is 160,000 ly, time in Earth frame is 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 * 1.00000013 = 160,000 + 0.208 = 160,000.208 years.

Tau = 160,000.208 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 160,000.208 * 0.00050995 ≈ 160,000 * 0.00050995 + 0.208 * 0.00050995.

Compute 160,000 * 0.00050995 = 160,000 * 5.0995e-4 = (160,000 * 5e-4) + (160,000 * 0.0995e-4) = 80 + 1.592 = 81.592.

0.208 * 0.00050995 ≈ 0.0001062.

So, total tau ≈ 81.592 + 0.0001062 ≈ 81.5921062 years ≈ 81.59 years.

So, approximately 81.6 years. So, the astronaut's age upon arrival would be 22 + 81.6 = 103.6 years, which is within their 150-year lifespan, so they survive.

So, the correct answer should be option C) 81 years.

Wait, but why isn't any option exactly 81.6? The options give 81 as option C, so that's the closest.

Therefore, the answer is C) 81 years.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how long the astronaut's journey will take from their perspective, we analyze the problem using the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and Lorentz contraction.

### Key Information:
1. **Distance to Earth**: The Large Magellanic Cloud is approximately 160,000 light-years away from Earth.
2. **Speed of the spacecraft**: \( v = 0.99999987c \), where \( c \) is the speed of light.
3. **Astronaut's age**: 22 years old.
4. **Average alien lifetime**: 150 years.

### Relativistic Calculations:
1. **Time Dilation**: The proper time (\( \tau \)) experienced by the astronaut is related to the Earth time (\( t \)) by the Lorentz factor:
   \[
   \tau = t \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
   \]
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \).

2. **Lorentz Factor (\( \gamma \))**:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
   \]
   Substituting \( v = 0.99999987c \):
   \[
   \frac{v^2}{c^2} = (0.99999987)^2 \approx 0.99999974
   \]
   \[
   1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} \approx 0.00000026
   \]
   \[
   \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \approx 0.0005099
   \]
   \[
   \gamma \approx \frac{1}{0.0005099} \approx 1960
   \]

3. **Earth Time (\( t \))**:
   The time taken for the journey from Earth's perspective is:
   \[
   t = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{160,000 \, \text{ly}}{0.99999987c} \approx 160,000 \cdot 1.00000013 \approx 160,000.208 \, \text{years}
   \]

4. **Proper Time (\( \tau \))**:
   From the astronaut's perspective:
   \[
   \tau = t \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} = 160,000.208 \cdot 0.0005099 \approx 81.59 \, \text{years}
   \]

### Conclusion:
The astronaut's proper time for the journey is approximately **81.6 years**. Since the astronaut is 22 years old, they would reach Earth at an age of \( 22 + 81.6 = 103.6 \), which is within their expected lifespan of 150 years. Therefore, the astronaut will survive the journey.

From the given options:
- **A)** Incorrect: The astronaut will not die before reaching Earth.
- **B)** Incorrect: The proper time is closer to 81 years, not 72 years.
- **C)** Correct: The proper time is approximately 81 years.
- **D)** Incorrect: The proper time is closer to 81 years, not 77 years.

Answer: C

Okay, so I have this physics problem here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, let me think through it step by step. So, the question is about an alien spacecraft traveling at a very high speed, 0.99999987 times the speed of light. They're trying to get to Earth, and the astronaut is 22 years old. I need to find out how long the trip takes from the astronaut's perspective, right?

Wait, I remember that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs. Time dilation is part of Einstein's theory of relativity. So, from the perspective of someone on Earth, time would pass normally, but from the perspective of the astronaut, time would be experienced more slowly. Or wait, no, wait. No, actually, the astronaut's own time would be their proper time, which is shorter than the time measured by someone else in a different inertial frame, like Earth. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no, no. Proper time is the time experienced by the traveler. So, if the spacecraft is moving relative to Earth, the Earth observer would see the spacecraft's time as dilated, meaning slower. So, from Earth's point of view, the trip would take a lot longer, but from the astronaut's perspective, things are different.

Wait, but the question is asking from the astronaut's point of view. So, I need to calculate the proper time for the trip. Proper time is calculated using the Lorentz transformation formula, right?

The formula for time dilation is the Lorentz factor gamma, which is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So, gamma equals 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Then, the proper time tau (τ) is equal to the Earth time multiplied by sqrt(1 - v²/c²), or equivalently, the Earth time is gamma times the proper time. So, since the question is about the astronaut's proper time, I need to find how much Earth time passes, then multiply by sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) to get the astronaut's time.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, from Earth's perspective, the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud is a certain amount. Let me think, what's the distance between the LMC and Earth? I think the LMC is about 160,000 to 170,000 light-years away. Oh wait, but the problem says the astronauts are from the LMC and are traveling to Earth, so the distance is about 160,000 light-years. So, from Earth's perspective, the spacecraft is traveling at 0.99999987c, so the time taken would be distance divided by speed.

But let me calculate that. So, distance D = 163,000 light-years (I'll approximate it as 163,000 for calculation). Speed v = 0.99999987c. So, Earth time is D / v = (163,000 ly) / (0.99999987c). Since 1 ly is the distance light travels in a year, when you divide by c, the units work out to years.

So, let me compute that. 163,000 / 0.99999987 is approximately equal to 163,000 * (1 / 0.99999987). Let me approximate 1/0.99999987 as about 1.00000013, since (1-0.99999987)=0.00000013, so 1/(1 - e) ≈ 1 + e for small e. So, 163,000 * 1.00000013 is approximately 163,000 + (163,000 * 1.3e-6) = 163,000 + 0.2119 ≈ 163,000.212 years.

Wait, but that seems like a long time. So, Earth time is about 163,000 years. But wait, wait, the LMC is about 160,000 light-years away, so the distance is about 160,000 ly, perhaps a bit more. So, maybe I should use 160,000 as the distance.

So, D = 160,000 ly. Then, Earth time is 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ 160,000 + (160,000 * 1.3e-6) = 160,000 + 0.208 ≈ 160,000.208 years.

So, from Earth's perspective, the trip takes about 160,000 years. But from the astronaut's perspective, their own time is shorter. So, their proper time would be Earth time multiplied by sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2).

Wait, let's compute gamma first. v = 0.99999987c.

v²/c² = (0.99999987)^2. Let me compute that. (0.99999987)^2 = approximately 0.99999974. So, 1 - v²/c² ≈ 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026. So, sqrt(0.00000026) = sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 5.1e-4 (since sqrt(2.5e-7) is about 5e-4). Let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 5e-4 squared is 2.5e-7, so yes, sqrt(2.6e-7) is approximately 5.099e-4. Let me compute sqrt(2.6e-7):

Let me compute 5.1e-4 squared: (5.1e-4)^2 = 26.01e-8 = 2.601e-7, which is very close to 2.6e-7. So, sqrt(2.6e-7)= approximately 5.1e-4.

So, sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ 0.0005099.

So, the proper time tau is Earth_time * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 160,000 * 0.0005099 ≈ 160,000 * 0.00051 ≈ 81.6 years.

Wait, that's about 81.6 years. So, the astronaut's own time is about 81.6 years. But wait, the astronaut is 22 years old. So, adding 81 years would make him 103 years old. But wait, the average lifetime of these aliens is 150 solar years. So, 103 is within that range. So, the astronaut would live long enough to reach Earth.

But wait, the options don't have 81.6 as an option, but option C is 81 years. So, that would make sense. So, the correct answer would be C) 81 years.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let me go through the calculations again.

First, compute gamma: gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.00000026) = 1 / (5.099e-4) ≈ 1960. So, gamma is about 1960. That makes sense because v is very close to c, so gamma is large.

From Earth's perspective, the time is D/v = 160,000 ly / (0.99999987c) = (160,000 / 0.99999987) years ≈ 160,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ 160,000 + (160,000 * 1.3e-6) ≈ 160,000 + 0.208 ≈ 160,000.208 years.

So, Earth time is about 160,000 years. The astronaut's time is tau = Earth_time / gamma = 160,000 / 1960 ≈ 81.57 years. So, approximately 81.6 years. So, the astronaut's age upon arrival would be 22 + 81.6 = 103.6 years, which is less than their average lifetime of 150 years. So, they'd survive the trip.

But wait, let me think again. The initial approach: from the astronaut's perspective, the distance is contracted. Because in their frame, the Earth is moving towards them at velocity v, so the distance is Lorentz-contracted. So, the proper length L0 is the Earth's frame length; the astronaut's frame would see a contracted length L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2).

Wait, so the time experienced by the astronaut is the distance in their frame divided by speed. So, their time tau = (L0 * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)) / v. Which is the same as (L0 / v) * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = (Earth_time) * sqrt(...). So, same as before.

So, the correct calculation is that the astronaut's time is around 81 years. So, the correct answer is option C, 81 years.

Wait, but let me check the numbers again, because 0.99999987c is 0.99999987 of the speed of light, so that's extremely close to c. So, gamma would be huge. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

v = 0.99999987c

v²/c² = (0.99999987)^2 = let's compute that exactly.

0.99999987 squared is approximately (1 - 1.3e-6)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*(1.3e-6) + (1.3e-6)^2. So, 1 - 2.6e-6 + 1.69e-12 ≈ 0.99999974.

So, 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026.

So, sqrt(0.00000026) ≈ 5.099e-4.

So, gamma is 1/(5.099e-4) ≈ 1960. So, gamma = 1960.

Wait, so Earth time is 160,000 years. Then, tau = 160,000 / gamma = 160,000 / 1960 ≈ 81.6 years.

So, the astronaut's time is about 81.6 years. So, the options are:

A) Astronaut dies before reaching Earth. No, because 81 years added to 22 would be 103, and their average is 150, so they'd survive.

B) 72 years: Hmm, that's lower than my calculation. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the distance. Let me think: what's the actual distance to the LMC? I thought it's about 160,000 light-years, but perhaps I should check. Wait, according to my knowledge, the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 170,000 light-years away. So, perhaps I should use 170,000 ly.

Let me recalculate with D = 170,000 ly.

So, Earth time is D/v = 170,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 170,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ 170,000 + (170,000 * 1.3e-6) ≈ 170,000 + 0.221 ≈ 170,002.21 years.

Tau = 170,000 / gamma = 170,000 / 1960 ≈ 86.73 years. Hmm, that's about 87 years, which is not exactly matching any of the options. Wait, but the options are 72, 77, 81, etc.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, maybe the problem is using a different distance.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to approximate the distance as 100,000 light-years? Because 170,000 ly might be considered too far, but perhaps the problem simplifies it. Or maybe the problem is just expecting a calculation based on v and not the actual distance, assuming that the distance is 1 light-year? But that can't be, because the options are in the tens of years, and the spaceship is going at 0.99999987c.

Wait, if the distance were 1 light-year, then the Earth time would be 1 / 0.99999987 ≈ 1.00000013 years. The astronaut's time would be 1.00000013 * sqrt(0.00000026) ≈ 1.00000013 * 5.099e-4 ≈ 0.00051 years, which is about 18.5 days. That's way less than the options given, so the problem must be considering a distance of 160,000 ly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in using the Earth's frame distance. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the time from the astronaut's perspective without considering Earth's frame. Let me re-express the problem.

Wait, the question is: How long will it take for their 22 years old astronaut to reach Earth using this incredibly fast spacecraft? From the astronaut's perspective.

So, the proper time for the astronaut is the time experienced during the trip. So, from their frame, the Earth is approaching them at speed v, so the distance is Lorentz-contracted.

Lorentz contraction is L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where L0 is the proper length (Earth's frame length).

So, the time experienced by the astronaut, tau, is L / v = (L0 * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)) / v. Which is the same as (L0 / v ) * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = (Earth time) * sqrt(...), which is the same as before.

So, the calculation should be correct.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects me to compute the time without considering the actual distance. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question, and the answer is that the astronaut dies before reaching because the trip takes longer than their lifetime. Hmm, but in that case, the proper time would have to be longer than their lifespan.

Wait, the astronaut is 22, and their average lifetime is 150 years, so they have about 128 years left. If the trip takes 81 years, they would reach Earth at 22 + 81 = 103 years, which is within their expected lifespan. So, they would survive.

So, the correct answer would be option C, 81 years.

Wait, but let me think again. The options are:

A) Astronaut will die before reaching Earth.

B) 72 years

C) 81 years

D) 77 years

So, our calculation is about 81.6 years, so option C is the closest.

But wait, perhaps I should recalculate using more precise numbers.

Let me compute gamma again. v = 0.99999987c.

v^2 = (0.99999987)^2 = 0.99999974000001 (exact calculation: 0.99999987 * 0.99999987.

Let me compute 0.99999987 * 0.99999987:

(1 - 0.00000013)^2 = 1 - 2*(0.00000013) + (0.00000013)^2 = 1 - 0.00000026 + 1.69e-12 ≈ 0.9999997400000169.

So, 1 - v^2/c^2 is 1 - 0.9999997400000169 = 0.0000002599999831.

So, sqrt(0.0000002599999831) = approximately 0.00050995.

So, gamma = 1 / 0.00050995 ≈ 1960.113.

Now, the proper time tau = D/(v * gamma).

Wait, because tau = (D / v) * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = D/(v gamma^{-1}) ) * sqrt(...). Hmm, perhaps another approach.

Wait, I think I'm getting a bit stuck in the weeds. Let's just proceed with the precise calculation.

If D is 160,000 ly, time in Earth frame is 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 * 1.00000013 = 160,000 + 0.208 = 160,000.208 years.

Tau = 160,000.208 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 160,000.208 * 0.00050995 ≈ 160,000 * 0.00050995 + 0.208 * 0.00050995.

Compute 160,000 * 0.00050995 = 160,000 * 5.0995e-4 = (160,000 * 5e-4) + (160,000 * 0.0995e-4) = 80 + 1.592 = 81.592.

0.208 * 0.00050995 ≈ 0.0001062.

So, total tau ≈ 81.592 + 0.0001062 ≈ 81.5921062 years ≈ 81.59 years.

So, approximately 81.6 years. So, the astronaut's age upon arrival would be 22 + 81.6 = 103.6 years, which is within their 150-year lifespan, so they survive.

So, the correct answer should be option C) 81 years.

Wait, but why isn't any option exactly 81.6? The options give 81 as option C, so that's the closest.

Therefore, the answer is C) 81 years.


To determine how long the astronaut's journey will take from their perspective, we analyze the problem using the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and Lorentz contraction.

### Key Information:
1. **Distance to Earth**: The Large Magellanic Cloud is approximately 160,000 light-years away from Earth.
2. **Speed of the spacecraft**: \( v = 0.99999987c \), where \( c \) is the speed of light.
3. **Astronaut's age**: 22 years old.
4. **Average alien lifetime**: 150 years.

### Relativistic Calculations:
1. **Time Dilation**: The proper time (\( \tau \)) experienced by the astronaut is related to the Earth time (\( t \)) by the Lorentz factor:
   \[
   \tau = t \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
   \]
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \).

2. **Lorentz Factor (\( \gamma \))**:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
   \]
   Substituting \( v = 0.99999987c \):
   \[
   \frac{v^2}{c^2} = (0.99999987)^2 \approx 0.99999974
   \]
   \[
   1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} \approx 0.00000026
   \]
   \[
   \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \approx 0.0005099
   \]
   \[
   \gamma \approx \frac{1}{0.0005099} \approx 1960
   \]

3. **Earth Time (\( t \))**:
   The time taken for the journey from Earth's perspective is:
   \[
   t = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{160,000 \, \text{ly}}{0.99999987c} \approx 160,000 \cdot 1.00000013 \approx 160,000.208 \, \text{years}
   \]

4. **Proper Time (\( \tau \))**:
   From the astronaut's perspective:
   \[
   \tau = t \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} = 160,000.208 \cdot 0.0005099 \approx 81.59 \, \text{years}
   \]

### Conclusion:
The astronaut's proper time for the journey is approximately **81.6 years**. Since the astronaut is 22 years old, they would reach Earth at an age of \( 22 + 81.6 = 103.6 \), which is within their expected lifespan of 150 years. Therefore, the astronaut will survive the journey.

From the given options:
- **A)** Incorrect: The astronaut will not die before reaching Earth.
- **B)** Incorrect: The proper time is closer to 81 years, not 72 years.
- **C)** Correct: The proper time is approximately 81 years.
- **D)** Incorrect: The proper time is closer to 81 years, not 77 years.
