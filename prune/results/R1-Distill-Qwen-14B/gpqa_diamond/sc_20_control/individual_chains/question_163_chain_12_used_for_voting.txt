Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about dissolving 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. We need to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to dissolve it and determine the pH of the resulting solution.

Hmm, Fe(OH)3 is a hydroxide, right? And we're adding a strong acid, which would react with it. Strong acid means it will dissociate completely, so the H+ ions from the acid will react with the OH- ions from Fe(OH)3.

Wait, but Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, I think. So when it reacts with a strong acid, the reaction should be something like Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe³+ + 3H2O. Yeah, that makes sense.

First, I need to find out how much Fe(OH)3 we have in moles. The molar mass calculation is needed here. Iron (Fe) has an atomic weight of about 55.85 g/mol, Oxygen (O) is 16 g/mol, and Hydrogen (H) is 1.008 g/mol.

Fe(OH)3 has one Fe, three O's, and three H's. So:

Fe: 55.85
O: 3 * 16 = 48
H: 3 * 1.008 = 3.024
Total molar mass = 55.85 + 48 + 3.024 = 106.874 g/mol.

So, moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.874 g/mol ≈ 0.0009357 mol. Let me calculate that more accurately.

0.1 / 106.874 = approximately 0.0009357 mol. So about 9.357e-4 moles.

Each mole of Fe(OH)3 reacts with 3 moles of H+ because the formula is Fe(OH)3, so the reaction is 1:3. So the moles of H+ needed would be 3 * 0.0009357 ≈ 0.002807 moles.

Wait, but wait. The acid is monobasic and strong, so each mole provides one mole of H+. So to get 0.002807 moles of H+, we need 0.002807 moles of the acid.

The acid is 0.1 M, so the volume required is moles / concentration. That would be 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 liters, which is 28.07 cm³. Oh, but wait, is that the minimum volume?

Wait, but wait. The problem states 100 cm³ as the total volume. So when we add the acid, it's being added to 100 cm³. But wait, wait. The 100 cm³ is the total volume after adding the acid? Or is it the initial volume before adding the acid?

Hmm, the question says: "dissolve ... in 100 cm³ total volume." Oh, I think it means the total solution after adding the acid and everything will be 100 cm³. So when we add the acid, the volume goes up. But wait, the volume of the acid is part of the total. So if I add V cm³ of acid, then the total volume is V + 100 cm³. But the question says the total volume is 100 cm³. So I think that can't be right. Or maybe the 100 cm³ is the volume after adding the acid.

Wait, maybe I've got this wrong. Let me think again.

The problem says: "dissolve (at 25°C) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ total volume." So the solution after dissolving should have a total volume of 100 cm³. So when you add the acid, the volume of the acid plus the volume of the water (or solution) is 100 cm³.

Wait, perhaps the acid is being added to the Fe(OH)3, which is in some solvent. But this is a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe the 100 cm³ is the final volume, so the acid's volume plus the solvent's volume equals 100 cm³. But I'm not sure. Wait, the problem says, "prepare the solution", so maybe the acid is added to the Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the Fe(OH)3 is dissolved in 100 cm³, and then the acid is added, and the total volume remains 100 cm³? That doesn't seem right because adding more liquid would change the volume.

Wait, perhaps the 100 cm³ is the final volume, so the acid's volume plus any other components (like Fe(OH)3 dissolved in water) equals 100 cm³. But perhaps the problem is treating the solution as being diluted into 100 cm³. I'm a bit confused, but perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the acid's volume is V, and the total solution volume is 100 cm³. So the initial volume before adding the acid is 100 cm³ - V. But maybe that's complicating it.

Alternatively, perhaps the 100 cm³ is the volume of the solution after adding the acid. So when you add V cm³ of acid to the Fe(OH)3 (which is in water), the total volume is V + (volume of Fe(OH)3 solution) = 100 cm³. But this is getting complicated. Maybe the question is considering that the Fe(OH)3 is dissolved in 100 cm³ of solution, and the acid is added to this, making the total volume more than 100. But the way the question is phrased, it says "dissolve ... in 100 cm³ total volume." So perhaps the total volume after everything is added is 100 cm³.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think: the problem says we need to find the minimum volume of acid (0.1 M) needed to dissolve Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³. So the acid is being added to the Fe(OH)3, which is in a solution, and the final volume is 100 cm³. So the acid volume plus any other solution (like water) equals 100 cm³. But perhaps the Fe(OH)3 is dissolved in water, and then the acid is added, making the total solution volume 100 cm³. So the acid's volume is V, and the water plus any other volumes sum to 100 cm³.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the acid's volume is V, and the volume after adding the acid is 100 cm³. So, the initial volume (before adding acid) is 100 cm³, and adding V cm³ of acid brings the total to 100 cm³. But that doesn't make sense because adding more liquid would increase the volume. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the Fe(OH)3 is dissolved in some solvent, and the total volume after adding the acid is 100 cm³. So the initial solution is let's say V_initial, and when you add V_acid, the total volume is V_initial + V_acid = 100 cm³. But without knowing V_initial, this is hard. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the acid is the only thing added, and the volume of the solution becomes 100 cm³. But that's not possible because the Fe(OH)3 has some volume too.

Hmm, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the acid's volume is V, and that the total volume after mixing is 100 cm³. So V_acid + V_water = 100 cm³. But since the Fe(OH)3 is solid, maybe the initial solution volume is negligible, and we can ignore it. Or perhaps the problem is treating the initial solution (Fe(OH)3 dissolved in solvent) as part of the 100 cm³, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simpler. Let's think about the stoichiometry first.

We have Fe(OH)3 reacting with H+ from the acid. The reaction is:

Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O.

So each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+.

We calculated that we have approximately 0.0009357 moles of Fe(OH)3. So the H+ needed is 3 × 0.0009357 ≈ 0.002807 moles.

The acid is 0.1 M, so the volume (V) needed is moles / concentration = 0.002807 / 0.1 = 0.02807 liters = 28.07 cm³.

Wait, but the options don't have 28.07 exactly. Looking at the options:

Option C is 28.05 cm³, pH 2.04.

Option B is 30.09, pH 2.69.

Wait, but why is the calculation giving me 28.07, which rounds to 28.07, but option C is 28.05. Hmm, perhaps I should calculate more precisely.

Wait, let me recalculate the moles of Fe(OH)3.

Molar mass of Fe(OH)3: Fe is 55.845 g/mol, O is 16.00, H is 1.008.

So Fe: 55.845, O:3×16=48, H:3×1.008=3.024.

Total: 55.845 + 48 +3.024 = 106.869 g/mol.

Molar mass is 106.869 g/mol.

Moles = 0.1 g / 106.869 g/mol ≈ 0.0009357 mol.

So H+ required: 3 × 0.0009357 = 0.0028071 mol.

Volume needed: 0.0028071 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.028071 L = 28.071 cm³.

So approximately 28.07 cm³. So the closest option is option C, which is 28.05 cm³. But wait, perhaps the exact calculation would give 28.05. Let me check.

Wait, 0.1 g / 106.869 g/mol is exactly 0.000935714 mol.

Then H+ needed is 0.000935714 ×3 = 0.002807142 mol.

Volume: 0.002807142 / 0.1 = 0.02807142 L = 28.07142 cm³.

Hmm, that's about 28.07 cm³. But option C is 28.05. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the exact molar mass.

Wait, maybe I should compute it to more decimal places.

Fe: 55.845 g/mol.

O: 16.00 g/mol.

H: 1.008 g/mol.

Fe(OH)3: 55.845 + 3*(16.00 + 1.008) = 55.845 +3*(17.008) =55.845 +51.024=106.869 g/mol.

So 0.1 g is 0.000935714 mol.

So H+ needed is 3 × 0.000935714 =0.002807142 mol.

Volume = 0.002807142 / 0.1 = 0.02807142 L = 28.07142 cm³.

So the volume is approximately 28.07 cm³, but option C is 28.05. So perhaps the question expects me to consider some other factors, like the dilution effect on the concentration. Oh, wait, because when you add the acid, the H+ concentration is not just the acid's concentration because the volume increases. So I think I need to account for the total volume when calculating the required H+.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because the problem states that the total solution volume is 100 cm³, so when you add V cm³ of acid, the total volume is 100 cm³. Hmm, but how does that affect the calculation?

Wait, the initial solution is made by dissolving Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. But when you add acid, the acid's volume contributes to the total volume.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that when I add V cm³ of acid to the 100 cm³ of solution, the total volume isn't exactly 100 + V, because of mixing. But I think the problem is simplifying it, perhaps assuming that the acid is added to 100 cm³, leading to a solution of 100 cm³. So the acid's volume plus the solvent's volume equals 100 cm³. Wait, that seems conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the 100 cm³ is the final volume, so including the acid. So the volume of the acid is V, and the solution made with Fe(OH)3 and acid has a volume of 100 cm³. So the initial volume of the Fe(OH)3 solution (before adding acid) plus V = 100 cm³. But without knowing the initial volume, perhaps we can assume that the initial volume is negligible, so V is approximately 100 cm³. But that can't be right because then the acid wouldn't be enough.

Wait, perhaps the initial solution is 100 cm³ without the acid, and adding acid increases the volume beyond that. But the problem says, "dissolve ... in 100 cm³ total volume," which probably means that after adding everything, the volume is 100 cm³.

In that case, the acid's volume is V, and the rest is solution to make up 100 cm³.

But wait, if the solution is prepared by adding V cm³ of acid to the 100 cm³, then the total volume would be 100 + V, which is more than 100. But the problem says the total volume is 100 cm³, so perhaps the acid is added to a solution that is less than 100 cm³. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should proceed with the initial calculation, assuming that the acid's volume is V and that the total solution volume is 100 cm³. So the initial solution (Fe(OH)3 dissolved in some solvent) plus V = 100 cm³.

But without knowing the initial volume, perhaps this approach is not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the acid is the only thing added, and the initial solution is made up to 100 cm³. So maybe the initial solution is 100 cm³, and the acid is added to it, making the total volume slightly more than 100. But the problem states the total is 100, so perhaps that's an assumption made by the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the volume of acid needed to react completely with Fe(OH)3, without considering the volume change. So perhaps the initial calculation is correct, giving 28.07 cm³. Looking at the options, the closest is option C, 28.05 cm³.

But wait, the options also have different pH values. So the second part is about the pH after the reaction.

So, after the reaction, the solution will contain Fe³+ ions. Also, perhaps some H+ ions may remain, depending on whether all the Fe(OH)3 is dissolved.

Wait, let me think. The reaction is Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe³+ + 3H2O. So all the Fe(OH)3 is dissolved, and the solution will have Fe³+ and excess H+ if any.

Wait, but in the calculation, we're using exactly the stoichiometric amount of H+. So H+ is exactly 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3. So the moles of H+ from the acid is 3 × 0.0009357 = 0.002807 mol.

But wait, the solution's volume is 100 cm³ (0.1 L). So the concentration of H+ is 0.002807 mol / 0.1 L = 0.02807 M.

Wait, but that's the concentration. The pH is the negative log of the H+ concentration.

pH = -log(0.02807) ≈ ?

Let me calculate that. Log(0.02807) is log(2.807e-2).

Log(2.807) ≈ 0.448. So 0.448 - 2 = -1.552. So pH is about 1.552? Wait, no, wait: 0.02807 is 2.807 x 10^-2. So the log is log(2.807) + log(10^-2) = 0.448 - 2 = -1.552. So pH is 1.552? That doesn't match any of the options.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the options have pH values around 2 to 5. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, wait a minute. Maybe I didn't account for the dilution correctly.

Wait, the acid solution is 0.1 M. When I add V cm³ of it, the moles of H+ is 0.1 × V/1000.

But the total volume after adding is 100 cm³, so the concentration of H+ in the final solution is (0.1 × V/1000) / (100/1000) ) = (0.1 V) / 100 = 0.001 V M.

Wait, but the moles of H+ needed to react with Fe(OH)3 is 0.002807 mol. So when I add V cm³ of acid, the H+ contributed is 0.1 × V/1000 = 0.0001 V mol.

Wait, no: 0.1 M is 0.1 mol per liter. So V cm³ is V/1000 liters. So H+ moles = 0.1 * (V/1000) = V/(10000) mol.

Wait, that's correct.

But wait, the H+ needed is 3 × moles of Fe(OH)3, which is 3 × (0.1 / 106.869) = 0.002807 mol.

So:

V/(10000) = 0.002807 → V = 0.002807 * 10000 = 28.07 cm³.

So same as before.

So the H+ contributed by the acid is 28.07 cm³ × 0.1 M × (1/1000) [to convert cm³ to liters] → 28.07 * 0.1 * 0.001 = 0.002807 mol.

Wait, but that's exactly the amount needed. So all the H+ is consumed in the reaction, and there's no excess. So the solution after reaction will have Fe³+ ions and any excess H+ from the acid.

Wait, but in this case, since it's exactly the stoichiometric amount, no excess H+ remains. So the concentration of H+ comes only from the dissociation of Fe³+.

Wait, but Fe³+ is a weak acid. It will hydrolyze in water:

Fe³+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

So the solution will be acidic due to the hydrolysis of Fe³+.

So to find the pH, I need to calculate the H+ concentration from the hydrolysis of Fe³+.

Hmm, but that's more complex.

The concentration of Fe³+ in solution is (moles Fe³+) / volume (in L).

Moles of Fe³+ = moles of Fe(OH)3 = 0.0009357 mol.

Volume = 0.1 L.

So concentration c = 0.0009357 / 0.1 = 0.009357 M.

Wait, but wait: after adding the acid, the volume is 100 cm³ (0.1 L), so that's correct.

Now, the hydrolysis reaction is:

Fe³+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The hydrolysis constant K is related to the Ksp of Fe(OH)3.

Wait, the K for the hydrolysis can be found using Kw / Ksp.

Wait, Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is known. I think it's about 6 × 10^-38 at 25°C.

Wait, but I might need to verify that. Alternatively, perhaps I should look up the K for the hydrolysis.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the hydrolysis of Fe³+ produces H+.

The reaction is:

Fe³+ + 3 H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3(s) + 3 H+.

But in solution, the Fe(OH)3 is a weak base and may not precipitate, but in this case, since we've added enough H+ to dissolve all the Fe(OH)3, perhaps the solution is clear, and the Fe³+ is in solution, so the hydrolysis will proceed to produce H+.

So, the concentration of Fe³+ is 0.009357 M.

The hydrolysis can be modeled using the formula for a weak acid. Wait, but Fe³+ hydrolyzes to produce H+; so it's acting like a weak acid.

The hydrolysis equation is Fe³+ + 3 H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The equilibrium expression is:

K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe³+]

But since Fe(OH)3 is a solid, its concentration is constant and can be incorporated into the K. So the expression becomes:

K = [H+]^3 / [Fe³+]

The K here is the hydrolysis constant, which is Kw / Ksp.

Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is about 6.0 ×10^-38.

So K = (1e-14) / (6.0e-38) ≈ 1.6667e23.

Wait, that's a large K, which makes sense because Fe³+ is a strong enough acid to give a low pH.

So, K = [H+]^3 / [Fe³+] = 1.6667e23.

Let me denote [H+] as x. Then:

x^3 / (0.009357 - x) ≈ 1.6667e23.

But since K is so large, x will be much larger than the initial concentration of Fe³+, so we can approximate 0.009357 - x ≈ -x, but that might not hold. Alternatively, perhaps x is approximately the cube root of (K × [Fe³+]).

Wait, let's think again. If K is very large, then [H+] will be much larger than the initial concentration of Fe³+. So perhaps x^3 ≈ K × [Fe³+].

So x = (K × [Fe³+])^(1/3).

But let's compute:

K × [Fe³+] = 1.6667e23 × 0.009357 ≈ 1.6667e23 * 9.357e-3 ≈ 1.556e21.

x^3 = 1.556e21 → x ≈ (1.556e21)^(1/3).

Let me compute that.

Cube root of 1.556e21 = (1.556)^(1/3) × (1e21)^(1/3).

Cube root of 1e21 is 1e7 (since (1e7)^3 = 1e21).

Cube root of 1.556 is approximately 1.16 (since 1.16^3 ≈ 1.56).

So x ≈ 1.16e7 M.

Wait, that can't be right. 1.16e7 M is way higher than any possible solution concentration. That's impossible because you can't have 1e7 M H+; it's way beyond the molarity of any solution.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating K. Let me recheck.

K for hydrolysis is Kw / Ksp.

Kw is 1e-14.

Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 6e-38.

So K = (1e-14) / (6e-38) ≈ 1.6667e23. That part seems correct.

Wait, but maybe I should consider the exact expression without approximation.

The expression is:

x^3 = K × (0.009357) × (0.009357 - x)^(-1).

But with K so large, 0.009357 - x would be negative, which can't be because concentrations can't be negative. So perhaps the assumption is that x is much larger than 0.009357, but that would mean the denominator becomes negative, which isn't possible. So perhaps the reaction goes to completion, and x is approximately the value that makes the denominator negligible.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the charge balance. The solution must be neutral, but given the Fe³+ ions, which are +3 charges, the solution will have a high concentration of H+.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the approximation that [H+] is much larger than [Fe³+], so that [Fe³+] ≈ 0.009357 M.

So x^3 = K × [Fe³+] → x = cube root(K × [Fe³+]).

Plugging in the numbers:

K × [Fe³+] = 1.6667e23 × 0.009357 ≈ 1.556e21.

Cube root of 1.556e21 is approximately (1.556e21)^(1/3). Let me compute this more accurately.

The cube of 1e7 is 1e21. So 1e7 is 1e7 M, but that's way too high. pH would be log(1e7) → -7, but that's not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the hydrolysis reaction. Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this using the solubility product.

Wait, another approach: the solubility of Fe(OH)3 in an acidic solution is determined by the reaction Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O. So the concentration of Fe^3+ can be found from the solubility, but in this case, the solubility is due to the reaction with H+.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.

After adding the acid, all Fe(OH)3 is dissolved, and the solution contains Fe^3+ ions. Now, Fe^3+ will hydrolyze in water:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The K for this reaction is K = Kw / Ksp.

Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is 6e-38, so K = (1e-14)/(6e-38) ≈ 1.6667e23.

The initial concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.009357 M.

Set up the equation:

K = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+]

Assuming that [H+] is much larger than [Fe^3+], so [Fe^3+] ≈ 0.009357.

So [H+]^3 = K * [Fe^3+] = 1.6667e23 * 0.009357 ≈ 1.556e21.

So [H+] = (1.556e21)^(1/3) ≈ (1e21)^(1/3) × (1.556)^(1/3).

(1e21)^(1/3) = 1e7.

Cube root of 1.556 is approximately 1.16.

So [H+] ≈ 1.16e7 M.

Wait, that's impossible because 1e7 M is way beyond any practical concentration. So the pH would be log(1.16e7) → approx 7.06, but that's basic, which contradicts the expected acidic solution.

Hmm, this can't be right. I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the Fe^3+ hydrolysis produces H+ ions, but the solution's H+ is already at a certain level from the acid added. Because the acid is a strong acid, and in stoichiometric quantity, perhaps the solution's pH is determined by the excess H+ from the acid.

Wait, no, because in the initial reaction, all the H+ from the acid is used to dissolve Fe(OH)3. So there's no excess H+ from the acid; all of it is consumed in the reaction.

Wait, but that leaves the solution with Fe^3+ which then hydrolyzes, contributing H+.

Wait, but according to the calculation, that would lead to an extremely high H+ concentration, which is impossible. So perhaps there's a mistake in the K value.

Wait, maybe I should look up the correct K for Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

Upon checking, I find that the hydrolysis constant for Fe^3+ is about 1.9 × 10^-34. Wait, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the K is Kw/Ksp, and Ksp is actually larger.

Wait, the Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 6 × 10^-38. So Kw is 1e-14. So K = 1e-14 / 6e-38 = approx 1.6667e23, which is what I had before.

But that leads to an H+ concentration way too high.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the assumption that all Fe(OH)3 is dissolved. Maybe in reality, the solution isn't able to dissolve all of it, but the question states that we need to dissolve it, so perhaps there's enough acid.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of pH. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps after adding the acid, the solution is acidic due to the excess H+ from the acid. But according to the earlier calculation, all H+ is consumed in dissolving the Fe(OH)3, leaving no excess. So the only H+ comes from the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

But that leads to an unreasonably high H+ concentration. So perhaps I should instead find the pH using the concentration of Fe^3+.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.009357 M. The hydrolysis reaction produces H+ such that:

[H+] = sqrt(3 × Kw / (Ksp × c)) )

Wait, no, I'm not sure about that formula. Alternatively, perhaps the pH can be found using the formula for a weak acid:

pH = (pKa + log(c)) / 2.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's better to use the approximation method.

Assume that [H+] = x.

Then, from the hydrolysis reaction:

x^3 = K × [Fe^3+]

x^3 = (1.6667e23) × 0.009357 → 1.556e21 → x = cube root(1.556e21) ≈ 1.16e7 M.

But that's impossible. So perhaps the assumption is wrong, and the solution can't hold that much H+.

Wait, perhaps the solution is so concentrated that it's not possible, which suggests that the hydrolysis doesn't proceed to that extent, and the pH is determined by the excess H+ from the acid.

Wait, but the acid is added in exactly the stoichiometric amount, so there's no excess H+ from the acid. So the only H+ comes from Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

But that's problematic because it leads to an unrealistic pH.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution volume is 100 cm³, so when the acid is added, the solution's concentration of H+ is due to both the acid and the hydrolysis.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that all the H+ from the acid is consumed. Let me think again.

The reaction is Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O.

So, for each mole of Fe(OH)3, we need 3 moles of H+.

So when we add exactly 0.002807 mol of H+ (from 28.07 cm³ of 0.1 M acid), all of it is consumed, and no excess H+ remains. So the solution's H+ concentration comes solely from the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

But that leads to an H+ concentration of 1.16e7 M, which is impossible. So perhaps this indicates that the solution's pH is determined by the excess H+ from the acid, but that's not the case here because the acid is exactly consumed.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me think about the dissociation of Fe^3+.

Wait, Fe^3+ is a weak acid, so it will donate H+ ions. The concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.009357 M. The hydrolysis reaction is:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The K for this reaction is K = Kw / Ksp = 1e-14 / 6e-38 ≈ 1.6667e23.

So, let's set up the equation:

x^3 = K * (c - x), where c is 0.009357 and x is [H+].

But K is so large that x is much larger than c. So c - x ≈ -x, but that doesn't make sense because it would lead to negative [Fe^3+], which isn't possible. So perhaps the proper approach is to consider that [Fe^3+] is much smaller than x, so [Fe^3+] ≈ x^3 / K.

Wait, let's rearrange the equation:

x^3 = K * (c - x)

Assuming x >> c, then x^3 ≈ K * (-x), which can't be because it gives a negative value. So perhaps x is not much larger than c.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to let x be the concentration of H+ produced by hydrolysis. Then:

x^3 = K * (c - x)

Wait, but with K being so large, perhaps x is approximately the cube root of (K * c).

So x ≈ (1.6667e23 * 0.009357)^(1/3) ≈ (1.556e21)^(1/3) ≈ 1.16e7 M.

But that's impossible. Therefore, perhaps the assumption is incorrect, and the pH is determined differently.

Wait, perhaps the pH is determined by the excess H+ from the acid. But in this case, the acid is exactly consumed, so no excess H+ remains. So the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

But that leads to an impossible pH, so perhaps I made a mistake in the K calculation.

Upon further research, I find that the Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is actually around 6 ×10^-38, which makes K = Kw/Ksp = (1e-14)/(6e-38) ≈ 1.6667e23.

Alternatively, perhaps the pH is determined by the concentration of Fe^3+ and its hydrolysis.

Wait, another approach: The solution after adding the acid and dissolving Fe(OH)3 will have Fe^3+ ions. The concentration is 0.009357 M.

The hydrolysis reaction produces H+:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The expression:

K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+]

Assuming that [Fe(OH)3] is negligible (as it's a solid), then:

K = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+]

So [H+] = cube_root( K * [Fe^3+] )

Plugging in the numbers:

[H+] = cube_root(1.6667e23 * 0.009357) ≈ cube_root(1.556e21) ≈ 1.16e7 M.

But this can't be correct, so perhaps I made a mistake in the K expression.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to find the pH using the concentration of Fe^3+ only.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that Fe^3+ is a weak acid, and its hydrolysis can be treated with the formula:

[H+] = sqrt(3c * Ka), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for a weak acid where the hydrolysis produces H+ ions.

For a salt of a weak acid (like Fe^3+), the pH can be found using:

pH = (pKa + log(c)) / 2.

Wait, but I'm not certain about this approach.

Wait, the pKa for Fe^3+ hydrolysis can be found from K. Since K = 1.6667e23 → pK = log(1.6667e23) ≈ 23.22.

So pKa = 23.22. Then the pH would be around (23.22 + log(0.009357)) / 2.

Wait, log(0.009357) is about -2.027.

So (23.22 - 2.027)/2 ≈ (21.193)/2 ≈ 10.5965. That's a basic pH, which can't be right because Fe^3+ is acidic.

Hmm, I'm getting really stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the pH is determined by the excess H+ from the strong acid. But earlier calculation showed that the acid is exactly consumed, so no excess. Thus, the only H+ comes from Fe^3+ hydrolysis. But that leads to an impossible pH.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem's options are wrong, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Maybe I can find the pH by considering that the solution is 0.009357 M Fe^3+.

The hydrolysis reaction produces H+:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O → Fe(OH)3 (s) + 3 H+.

The K for this reaction is Kw/Ksp = 1e-14 / 6e-38 ≈ 1.6667e23.

Let me set up the equation:

[H+]^3 / [Fe^3+] = 1.6667e23.

[H+]^3 = 1.6667e23 * [Fe^3+].

[Fe^3+] decreases as H+ increases, so:

Assume [Fe^3+] ≈ 0.009357 M (since K is so large), then:

[H+]^3 = 1.6667e23 * 0.009357 ≈ 1.556e21.

[H+] = (1.556e21)^(1/3) ≈ 1.16e7 M.

But as I said before, that's impossible because 1e7 M is way beyond any practical concentration. Thus, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the pH is determined by the excess H+ from the acid. But in the initial reaction, all H+ is consumed, so no excess.

Hmm... I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again.

The options are:

A) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³

B) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³

C) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³

D) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³

Earlier, the volume came out to about 28.07 cm³, which matches option C's 28.05 cm³. But the pH in option C is 2.04.

Wait, if the [H+] is 0.02807 M (from the initial H+ from the acid, but that's all consumed), but if the solution's pH is determined by the Fe^3+ hydrolysis leading to a much higher [H+], but that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the initial H+ concentration.

Wait, another thought: after the reaction, the solution contains Fe^3+ and any remaining H+ from the acid. But wait, the acid is added in the exact stoichiometric amount, so all H+ is consumed. So the only H+ comes from the hydrolysis of Fe^3+. But that leads to an unreasonably high [H+], which can't be correct.

Wait, perhaps I should ignore the hydrolysis and assume that the solution's pH is determined by the excess H+ from the acid. But that's not the case because the acid is exactly consumed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the pH based on the concentration of H+ provided by the acid, without considering the hydrolysis. But that would be wrong because the H+ is used up.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that after adding the acid, the solution has Fe^3+ and excess H+ from the acid. But according to the stoichiometry, the H+ is exactly used up, so no excess.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the pH after the reaction without considering the hydrolysis of Fe^3+. But that would be incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps I should proceed with the calculation as per the initial assumption, giving the volume as approximately 28.07 cm³, matching option C, and the pH as 2.04.

Wait, how does pH 2.04 come about? Let me think. If the [H+] is 0.02807 M, then pH is -log(0.02807) ≈ 1.55, but that's not matching any option. So perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the pH based on the concentration of Fe^3+.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of [H+].

Wait, another approach: perhaps the pH is determined by the concentration of Fe^3+ as a weak acid.

The hydrolysis reaction is:

Fe^3+ + H2O ↔ Fe(OH)^2+ + H+.

The K for this reaction can be found using the hydrolysis constant.

Wait, but I think I'm getting stuck here. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should proceed with the initial calculation, select option C, and see if the pH matches.

Wait, but according to the initial calculation, the pH from H+ would be 1.55, which is not among the options. The closest option is C with pH 2.04.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that after the reaction, the solution has Fe^3+ and the H+ from the acid (but I thought that was all consumed). 

Wait, perhaps the calculation should be done using the total H+ in solution, which includes both the H+ from the acid and the H+ from Fe^3+ hydrolysis. But that doesn't make sense because the H+ from the acid is consumed.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that after the reaction, the solution's H+ comes only from the acid and the hydrolysis.

Wait, let me think again. The problem says "the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid needed to prepare the solution."

So perhaps when the minimum volume is added, all the Fe(OH)3 is dissolved, and the solution is just saturated. So perhaps the pH is determined by the concentration of H+ from the acid and the hydrolysis.

But I'm not making progress here. Maybe I should look for another way.

Alternatively, perhaps the pH is calculated using the concentration of Fe^3+ and using the hydrolysis formula.

Wait, perhaps using the formula for a weak acid:

[H+] = sqrt( (3c * K) )

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the approximation that [H+] = sqrt(3cK).

But I'm not certain. Let's try.

[H+] = sqrt(3 * 0.009357 * 1.6667e23 )

3 * 0.009357 ≈ 0.02807.

0.02807 * 1.6667e23 ≈ 4.68e21.

sqrt(4.68e21) ≈ 6.84e10 M. Which is impossible.

Hmm, this is really confusing.

Wait, perhaps I should accept that the pH is given by the initial H+ concentration from the acid, which is 0.02807 M, leading to pH≈1.55. But none of the options match that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the hydrolysis and take pH as from the acid. But that would give pH 1.55, not matching options.

Wait, the options have pH values around 2-3, which suggests that the [H+] is about 0.01 M. So pH around 2.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the pH based on the concentration of Fe^3+ and its hydrolysis.

Let me try a different approach using the charge balance.

In solution, the charge balance is:

[Fe^3+] = [OH-] + 3 [Fe(OH)3^-] (but since Fe(OH)3 is a solid, perhaps it's negligible).

Alternatively, considering that the only significant ions are H+ and Fe^3+.

So:

3[Fe^3+] = [H+]

Because each Fe^3+ contributes +3 charge, and the H+ contributes +1.

So:

[H+] = 3 × [Fe^3+] = 3 × 0.009357 ≈ 0.02807 M.

So pH = -log(0.02807) ≈ 1.55. But this isn't matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the charge balance includes OH-.

So:

3[Fe^3+] = [H+] + [OH-]

But [OH-] is Kw/[H+].

So:

3c = [H+] + Kw/[H+]

Where c is 0.009357 M.

Let me set [H+] = x.

So:

3*0.009357 = x + (1e-14)/x.

This is a quadratic equation:

3*0.009357 = x + (1e-14)/x.

Multiply both sides by x:

3 * 0.009357 x = x² + 1e-14.

Rearranged:

x² - 3*0.009357 x - 1e-14 = 0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [3*0.009357 ± sqrt( (3*0.009357)^2 + 4*1e-14 ) ] / 2.

Compute the discriminant:

(3*0.009357)^2 = (0.028071)^2 ≈ 0.000788.

Adding 4*1e-14 gives approximately 0.000788.

So sqrt(0.000788) ≈ 0.02807.

So x ≈ [0.02807 ± 0.02807 ] / 2.

Taking the positive root:

x ≈ (0.02807 + 0.02807)/2 = 0.02807.

So [H+] ≈ 0.02807 M → pH ≈ 1.55.

But again, this doesn't match any options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the solution's pH is determined by the excess H+ from the acid, which in this case, there is none. So the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

But as before, that leads to an impossible [H+].

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the hydrolysis and proceed with the initial H+ concentration.

Given the time I've spent, I think the correct answer is option C: 28.05 cm³ and pH 2.04.

But I'm not confident about the pH. Alternatively, perhaps the pH is determined by the concentration of H+ from the acid, leading to pH around 1.55, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps I should reevaluate the initial assumption.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the Fe(OH)3 is dissolved in 100 cm³ of solution, and the acid is added, making the total volume 100 cm³. So the volume of the acid added is V, and the solution's volume after adding is 100 cm³. So the initial solution (Fe(OH)3 dissolved in some solvent) is 100 - V cm³.

But without the initial solution's volume, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the initial calculation, leading to option C as the answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ in 100 cm³ of solution, the reaction with a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid is considered:

\[
\text{Fe(OH)}_3 + 3\text{H}^+ \rightarrow \text{Fe}^{3+} + 3\text{H}_2\text{O}.
\]

### Step 1: Calculate moles of Fe(OH)₃
The molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ is calculated as:
\[
\text{Molar mass of Fe(OH)}_3 = 55.845 + 3(16.00 + 1.008) = 106.869 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]
The moles of Fe(OH)₃ are:
\[
\text{Moles of Fe(OH)}_3 = \frac{0.1}{106.869} \approx 0.0009357 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 2: Determine moles of H⁺ required
From the stoichiometry of the reaction, 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ reacts with 3 moles of H⁺. Thus, the moles of H⁺ required are:
\[
\text{Moles of H}^+ = 3 \times 0.0009357 \approx 0.002807 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate volume of 0.1 M acid required
The volume of 0.1 M acid required to provide 0.002807 moles of H⁺ is:
\[
V = \frac{\text{Moles of H}^+}{\text{Concentration of acid}} = \frac{0.002807}{0.1} = 0.02807 \, \text{L} = 28.07 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]
This matches closely with the given option **28.05 cm³**.

### Step 4: Determine the pH of the resulting solution
After the reaction, the solution contains Fe³⁺ ions, which hydrolyze in water:
\[
\text{Fe}^{3+} + 3\text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{Fe(OH)}_3 + 3\text{H}^+.
\]
The hydrolysis constant \( K \) is related to the solubility product (\( K_{sp} \)) and ion product (\( K_w \)):
\[
K = \frac{K_w}{K_{sp}} = \frac{1 \times 10^{-14}}{6 \times 10^{-38}} \approx 1.667 \times 10^{23}.
\]
The concentration of Fe³⁺ in the solution is:
\[
[\text{Fe}^{3+}] = \frac{\text{Moles of Fe}^{3+}}{\text{Volume of solution}} = \frac{0.0009357}{0.1} = 0.009357 \, \text{M}.
\]
Using the hydrolysis equilibrium expression:
\[
K = \frac{[\text{H}^+]^3}{[\text{Fe}^{3+}]},
\]
\[
[\text{H}^+]^3 = K \cdot [\text{Fe}^{3+}] = (1.667 \times 10^{23})(0.009357) \approx 1.56 \times 10^{21}.
\]
\[
[\text{H}^+] = (1.56 \times 10^{21})^{1/3} \approx 1.16 \times 10^7 \, \text{M}.
\]
This result is unreasonably high, suggesting an error in the assumption or calculation. Instead, the pH is likely determined by the initial H⁺ concentration from the acid, which is:
\[
[\text{H}^+] = \frac{\text{Moles of H}^+}{\text{Volume of solution}} = \frac{0.002807}{0.1} = 0.02807 \, \text{M}.
\]
The pH is:
\[
\text{pH} = -\log(0.02807) \approx 1.55.
\]
However, none of the options match this value. Given the provided options, the closest match is **pH 2.04**.

### Final Answer
The minimum volume of acid required is **28.05 cm³**, and the pH of the resulting solution is **2.04**.

**Answer: C**
