Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about pH calculations. But I'll try to take it step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The problem says: Determine the pH of the solution made by mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. The options are A to D.

Hmm, so the solution is a mixture of a weak acid (acetic acid), a strong acid (HCl), and a strong base (barium hydroxide). I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So, I need to figure out if there's excess acid or base after the neutralization.

First, I think I should calculate the moles of each acid and base in the solution. Because moles will tell me how much each substance I have, regardless of the volume, and then I can see what's left after reactions.

Let me jot down the formulas:

Molarity (M) = moles / liters. So moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters).

Calculating each component:

1. CH3COOH: 0.1 M * 0.5 L (since 500 mL is 0.5 L) = 0.05 moles.
2. HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles.
3. Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will dissociate completely into Ba^2+ and OH^- ions. Since each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- ions, the moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

HCl is a strong acid, so it will fully dissociate into H+ and Cl^- ions. So, moles of H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles.

CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. Its contribution of H+ is negligible compared to the strong acid, but I think when mixed with a base, maybe it can react. Hmm, but wait, let's think about the neutralization reaction.

The H+ comes from both HCl and the dissociation of CH3COOH. But since HCl is a strong acid, it will provide a lot of H+ ions. The OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react with H+ from HCl and CH3COOH.

So, the first step is to find out the total H+ and OH- in the solution.

Wait, let's think in terms of H+ and OH- moles.

Total H+:
- From HCl: 0.08 moles.
- From CH3COOH: Let's say it's negligible because it's a weak acid. Or wait, perhaps not? Because if some of the H+ from HCl is neutralized by OH-, the remaining H+ might cause CH3COOH to dissociate more. Hmm. This could complicate things. Alternatively, maybe the CH3COOH's H+ is negligible compared to HCl. Let me think: HCl is 0.08 moles, and CH3COOH is 0.05 moles. So if HCl is strong, it's going to contribute more H+. But when you mix them with a strong base, the H+ and OH- will react first.

So, let's proceed step by step.

First, find the total moles of H+ and OH-.

H+:
- From HCl: 0.08 moles.

CH3COOH provides some H+, but since it's weak and we're mixing with strong acid and base, maybe we can treat its H+ as negligible in the initial neutralization. So, let's focus on the strong acid and base first.

OH-:
- From Ba(OH)2: 0.18 moles.

Now, when you mix H+ and OH-, they will neutralize each other. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

So, the moles of H+ available (from HCl) are 0.08. The OH- is 0.18. So, OH- is in excess. The amount of OH- left after neutralizing H+ is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles.

But wait, that's not all. Because the acetic acid (CH3COOH) is also present. Now, any leftover OH- will react with the CH3COOH.

So, the reaction between OH- and CH3COOH would be:

CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So, the OH- will deprotonate the acetic acid, producing acetate ions.

We have 0.10 moles of OH- left after neutralizing HCl. Let's see how much CH3COOH is present: 0.05 moles.

So, OH- (0.10 moles) will react with CH3COOH (0.05 moles). Since OH- is more than the available CH3COOH, all of the CH3COOH will be neutralized, and some OH- will remain.

So, the reaction: 0.05 moles of CH3COOH + 0.05 moles of OH- → 0.05 moles of CH3COO^- and 0.05 *1 = 0.05 moles H2O.

But wait, we have 0.10 moles of OH- initially after neutralizing HCl. So, after reacting with CH3COOH: 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles OH- remaining.

Now, the solution will have excess OH-.

So, the total volume of the solution is the sum of all the volumes: 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL or 1.2 liters.

So, the concentration of OH- is 0.05 moles / 1.2 L = approximately 0.041666... M.

Wait, but wait a second. The initial H+ comes from HCl (0.08 moles) and CH3COOH (0.05), but if the OH- is 0.18, which is more than the H+, then all H+ is neutralized, and some OH- remains, which then reacts with CH3COOH.

So, the OH- excess is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10. Then, OH- reacts with CH3COOH: 0.05 moles CH3COOH can neutralize 0.05 moles OH-.

So, remaining OH- is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles.

So, in the solution, we have 0.05 moles of OH- in 1.2 L.

Now, the concentration of OH- is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0416667 M.

Then, the pOH is -log(0.0416667). Let me calculate that.

pOH = -log(0.0416667) → log(0.0416667) ≈ log(4.16667e-2). 

Remember, log(4) is about 0.602, log(4.1667) is a bit higher. Let me compute it more accurately. Alternatively, use a calculator approach.

But wait, perhaps I can approximate. 

What's log(4.16667e-2)?

Log(4.16667e-2) = log(4.16667) + log(1e-2) = 0.6198 (since log(4)=0.60, log(4.1667)=approx 0.62) → 0.62 - 2 = -1.38.

So, pOH = 1.38.

Then, pH = 14 - pOH = 14 -1.38 = 12.62.

Wait, but wait a second. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate this more precisely.

Let me compute 0.0416667 more accurately. So, 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.041666... M.

Take log(0.0416667):

I can write it as 4.16667 × 10^-2.

Log(4.16667) is approximately 0.62, because:

Log(4) = 0.60206, log(4.1) ~0.61278, log(4.16667) → let's compute it.

We can find log(4.16667) by linear approximation or using a calculator method.

Alternatively, use exact calculation.

But perhaps the exact value isn't necessary because the options are given. The pOH is around 1.38, leading to a pH of 12.62, which is option A.

Wait, but let me double-check the steps because I might have missed something.

Wait, when Ba(OH)2 is added, each mole gives two OH- ions. So, the initial moles of OH- is 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-, so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles OH-.

HCl is 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles HCl, which gives 0.08 moles H+.

CH3COOH is 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles.

So, H+ from HCl is 0.08, OH- is 0.18.

H+ and OH- neutralize each other: 0.08 H+ + 0.08 OH- → 0.08 H2O. So, remaining OH- is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10.

Now, the OH- will react with CH3COOH. The reaction is:

CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

Moles of OH-: 0.10, moles of CH3COOH: 0.05.

So, CH3COOH will be completely neutralized, and OH- will have 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles left.

So, excess OH- is 0.05 moles.

Total volume is 1.2 L. So, concentration of OH- is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.041667 M.

pOH is -log(0.041667) → let's compute that.

log(0.041667) = log(4.1667e-2) = log(4.1667) + log(1e-2) = 0.62 + (-2) = -1.38.

So, pOH is 1.38. pH is 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

Looking at the options, option A is 12.62. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any steps or miscalculate.

Another way to think about it: after neutralizing H+ from HCl, any remaining OH- will react with the weak acid (CH3COOH). Since OH- is in excess, all CH3COOH will react, leaving some OH-.

So, the solution will be basic, so pH should be above 7. Options A is 12.62, which is basic, B is 1.38 (acidic), C is 8.92 (slightly basic), D is 8.68 (slightly basic). So our calculation points to A.

But wait, wait another thing: what about the acetate ions produced? Do they affect the pH? Well, in the presence of excess OH-, the solution will be dominated by OH- concentration, so the acetate's effect (from CH3COO^-) would be minimal because it's a weak base but in a solution that's already strongly basic. So, the pH is determined by the excess OH-.

So, I think the conclusion is correct.

To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the mixture of 500 mL of 0.1 M CH₃COOH (weak acid), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (strong acid), and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)₂ (strong base). The steps are as follows:

1. **Calculate moles of each component:**
   - CH₃COOH: \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{moles} \)
   - HCl: \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{moles} \)
   - Ba(OH)₂: \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{moles} \)

   Since Ba(OH)₂ dissociates completely, it provides \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles of OH}^- \).

2. **Neutralization of H⁺ and OH⁻:**
   - HCl contributes \( 0.08 \, \text{moles of H}^+ \).
   - Ba(OH)₂ contributes \( 0.18 \, \text{moles of OH}^- \).
   - The \( 0.08 \, \text{moles of H}^+ \) reacts with \( 0.08 \, \text{moles of OH}^- \), leaving \( 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{moles of OH}^- \).

3. **Reaction of excess OH⁻ with CH₃COOH:**
   - CH₃COOH reacts with OH⁻: \( \text{CH₃COOH} + \text{OH}^- \rightarrow \text{CH₃COO}^- + \text{H₂O} \).
   - CH₃COOH has \( 0.05 \, \text{moles} \), which neutralizes \( 0.05 \, \text{moles of OH}^- \).
   - After this reaction, \( 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{moles of OH}^- \) remains.

4. **Calculate OH⁻ concentration:**
   - Total volume of the solution is \( 500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L} \).
   - Concentration of OH⁻: \( \frac{0.05 \, \text{moles}}{1.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.04167 \, \text{M} \).

5. **Determine pH:**
   - pOH: \( -\log(0.04167) \approx 1.38 \).
   - pH: \( 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62 \).

The solution is basic due to the excess OH⁻, and the pH is \( 12.62 \). Among the options, the correct answer is **A**.

Now, the solution will have excess OH-.

So, the total volume of the solution is the sum of all the volumes: 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL or 1.2 liters.

So, the concentration of OH- is 0.05 moles / 1.2 L = approximately 0.041666... M.

Wait, but wait a second. The initial H+ comes from HCl (0.08 moles) and CH3COOH (0.05), but if the OH- is 0.18, which is more than the H+, then all H+ is neutralized, and some OH- remains, which then reacts with CH3COOH.

So, the OH- excess is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10. Then, OH- reacts with CH3COOH: 0.05 moles CH3COOH can neutralize 0.05 moles OH-.

So, remaining OH- is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles.

So, in the solution, we have 0.05 moles of OH- in 1.2 L.

Now, the concentration of OH- is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0416667 M.

Then, the pOH is -log(0.0416667). Let me calculate that.

pOH = -log(0.0416667) → log(0.0416667) ≈ log(4.16667e-2).

HCl is 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles HCl, which gives 0.08 moles H+.

CH3COOH is 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles.

So, H+ from HCl is 0.08, OH- is 0.18.

H+ and OH- neutralize each other: 0.08 H+ + 0.08 OH- → 0.08 H2O. So, remaining OH- is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10.

Now, the OH- will react with CH3COOH. The reaction is:

CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

Moles of OH-: 0.10, moles of CH3COOH: 0.05.

So, CH3COOH will be completely neutralized, and OH- will have 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles left.

So, excess OH- is 0.05 moles.

Total volume is 1.2 L. So, concentration of OH- is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.041667 M.

pOH is -log(0.041667) → let's compute that.

log(0.041667) = log(4.1667e-2) = log(4.1667) + log(1e-2) = 0.62 + (-2) = -1.38.

So, pOH is 1.38. pH is 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

Looking at the options, option A is 12.62. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any steps or miscalculate.

So, the pH is determined by the excess OH-.

So, I think the conclusion is correct.


To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the mixture of 500 mL of 0.1 M CH₃COOH (weak acid), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (strong acid), and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)₂ (strong base). The steps are as follows:

1. **Calculate moles of each component:**
   - CH₃COOH: \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{moles} \)
   - HCl: \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{moles} \)
   - Ba(OH)₂: \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{moles} \)

   Since Ba(OH)₂ dissociates completely, it provides \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles of OH}^- \).

2. **Neutralization of H⁺ and OH⁻:**
   - HCl contributes \( 0.08 \, \text{moles of H}^+ \).
   - Ba(OH)₂ contributes \( 0.18 \, \text{moles of OH}^- \).
   - The \( 0.08 \, \text{moles of H}^+ \) reacts with \( 0.08 \, \text{moles of OH}^- \), leaving \( 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{moles of OH}^- \).

3. **Reaction of excess OH⁻ with CH₃COOH:**
   - CH₃COOH reacts with OH⁻: \( \text{CH₃COOH} + \text{OH}^- \rightarrow \text{CH₃COO}^- + \text{H₂O} \).
   - CH₃COOH has \( 0.05 \, \text{moles} \), which neutralizes \( 0.05 \, \text{moles of OH}^- \).
   - After this reaction, \( 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{moles of OH}^- \) remains.

4. **Calculate OH⁻ concentration:**
   - Total volume of the solution is \( 500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L} \).
   - Concentration of OH⁻: \( \frac{0.05 \, \text{moles}}{1.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.04167 \, \text{M} \).

5. **Determine pH:**
   - pOH: \( -\log(0.04167) \approx 1.38 \).
   - pH: \( 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62 \).

The solution is basic due to the excess OH⁻, and the pH is \( 12.62 \). Among the options, the correct answer is **A**.

Answer: A
