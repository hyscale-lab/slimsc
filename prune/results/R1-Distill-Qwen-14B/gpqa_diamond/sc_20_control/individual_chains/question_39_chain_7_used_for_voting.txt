Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it step by step.

So, the question says we have ten thousand identical systems, each with a particle in the same conditions. Each particle can move along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measured the position, none were found outside between x=1 and x=3. So the particles are only found between 1 and 3. 

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the wave function's square gives the probability density. So to find where the particles are, we look at the modulus squared of the wave function. Oh right, because the particle's position probability is |ψ(x)|². 

The given wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So let's compute the modulus squared. The modulus of a complex number a + bi is sqrt(a² + b²), so the square is a² + b². 

So ψ(x) has real part a/sqrt(1+x) and imaginary part -0.5. So the modulus squared would be [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2. 

But wait, the problem states that the wave function exists only where the particles can be found, which is between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function is zero outside this region, meaning that the probability density outside is zero. But wait, the given wave function doesn't explicitly say that. Oh wait, perhaps the wave function is zero outside 1<x<3. Or perhaps the given expression is valid only in that region, and zero elsewhere.

But the problem states that in the part where the particle can exist, the wave function is given. So perhaps the wave function is that expression between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. So the wave function is zero for x<1 and x>3, but in between, it's (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. 

But wait, the wave function must be normalizable. So the integral of |ψ|² dx from -infinity to infinity must be 1. But since ψ is zero outside 1 to 3, the integral is from 1 to 3. 

So let me calculate the integral:

∫ |ψ(x)|² dx from 1 to 3 = 1. 

So |ψ(x)|² is [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2.

So the integral becomes ∫ [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx from x=1 to x=3.

Let's break that integral into two parts:

Integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3 + Integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3.

Compute each part:

First integral: a² * ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to 3. So a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5.

So the total is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So:

a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Subtract 0.5 from both sides:

a² ln(2) = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2). I remember ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Then a² ≈ 0.7213, so a is the square root of that. Let me calculate sqrt(0.7213).

Hmm, sqrt(0.7225) is 0.85 because 0.85^2 is 0.7225. So sqrt(0.7213) is just a bit less than 0.85. Let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, let me compute 0.85^2: 0.85 * 0.85 = 0.7225. So 0.7225 is 0.85 squared. We have a² = 0.7213, which is a bit less. So a is roughly 0.85 minus a small amount. Let me compute sqrt(0.7213).

Alternatively, maybe I can compute it approximately. Let's say:

0.7213 is 0.7225 - 0.0012. So sqrt(0.7225 - 0.0012) ≈ 0.85 - (0.0012)/(2*0.85) ) using the binomial approximation for sqrt(a - b) ≈ sqrt(a) - b/(2 sqrt(a)).

So 0.0012/(2*0.85) = 0.0012/(1.7) ≈ 0.00070588. So 0.85 - 0.0007 is approximately 0.8493. So a is about 0.849, which is roughly 0.85. 

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So the answer is B. 

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I make any mistake in the setup? 

Another possible point of confusion: Is the wave function given the entire story? The wave function is ψ(x) = a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i. So the square of the modulus is [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2. So my previous calculation is correct. 

Another thing: the region from x=1 to x=3. So when x=1, 1+x=2. When x=3, 1+x=4. So the integral is from 1 to 3. 

Wait, let me re-calculate the integral:

Integral from 1 to 3 of a²/(1+x) dx is a² ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3. The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x), so from 1 to 3: [ln(4) - ln(2)] = ln(2). So that part is correct. 

Then the second integral is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5. Correct. 

So a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1 → a² = (0.5)/ln(2) → which is about 0.7213. So a is about 0.849, which rounds to 0.85. So the correct answer is B) 0.85.

To determine the value of \( a \), we start by analyzing the given wave function:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The probability density is given by the modulus squared of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Since the particle is only found between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), the wave function is zero outside this region. To normalize the wave function, the integral of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \) must equal 1:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

\[
\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx + \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 1
\]

1. **First integral**:  
   \[
   \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx = a^2 \left[\ln(1+x)\right]_1^3 = a^2 \left(\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right) = a^2 \ln(2)
   \]

2. **Second integral**:  
   \[
   \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5
   \]

Adding these results:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Subtracting \( 0.5 \) from both sides:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849
\]

This value is approximately \( 0.85 \), which matches option **B**. Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**

The given wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So let's compute the modulus squared. The modulus of a complex number a + bi is sqrt(a² + b²), so the square is a² + b². 

So ψ(x) has real part a/sqrt(1+x) and imaginary part -0.5. So the modulus squared would be [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2. 

But wait, the problem states that the wave function exists only where the particles can be found, which is between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function is zero outside this region, meaning that the probability density outside is zero. But wait, the given wave function doesn't explicitly say that.

But wait, the wave function must be normalizable. So the integral of |ψ|² dx from -infinity to infinity must be 1. But since ψ is zero outside 1 to 3, the integral is from 1 to 3. 

So let me calculate the integral:

∫ |ψ(x)|² dx from 1 to 3 = 1. 

So |ψ(x)|² is [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2.

So the integral becomes ∫ [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx from x=1 to x=3.

Let's break that integral into two parts:

Integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3 + Integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3.

Compute each part:

First integral: a² * ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to 3. So a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5.

So the total is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So:

a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Subtract 0.5 from both sides:

a² ln(2) = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2). I remember ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Then a² ≈ 0.7213, so a is the square root of that. Let me calculate sqrt(0.7213).

Hmm, sqrt(0.7225) is 0.85 because 0.85^2 is 0.7225. So sqrt(0.7213) is just a bit less than 0.85. Let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, let me compute 0.85^2: 0.85 * 0.85 = 0.7225. So 0.7225 is 0.85 squared. We have a² = 0.7213, which is a bit less. So a is roughly 0.85 minus a small amount. Let me compute sqrt(0.7213).

Alternatively, maybe I can compute it approximately. Let's say:

0.7213 is 0.7225 - 0.0012. So sqrt(0.7225 - 0.0012) ≈ 0.85 - (0.0012)/(2*0.85) ) using the binomial approximation for sqrt(a - b) ≈ sqrt(a) - b/(2 sqrt(a)).

So 0.0012/(2*0.85) = 0.0012/(1.7) ≈ 0.00070588. So 0.85 - 0.0007 is approximately 0.8493. So a is about 0.849, which is roughly 0.85. 

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So the answer is B. 

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I make any mistake in the setup? 

Another possible point of confusion: Is the wave function given the entire story? The wave function is ψ(x) = a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i. So the square of the modulus is [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2. So my previous calculation is correct.

Wait, let me re-calculate the integral:

Integral from 1 to 3 of a²/(1+x) dx is a² ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3. The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x), so from 1 to 3: [ln(4) - ln(2)] = ln(2). So that part is correct. 

Then the second integral is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5. Correct. 

So a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1 → a² = (0.5)/ln(2) → which is about 0.7213. So a is about 0.849, which rounds to 0.85. So the correct answer is B) 0.85.

Since the particle is only found between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), the wave function is zero outside this region. To normalize the wave function, the integral of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \) must equal 1:

   \]

2. **Second integral**:  
   \[

   \]

Adding these results:

Subtracting \( 0.5 \) from both sides:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849
\]

This value is approximately \( 0.85 \), which matches option **B**. Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
