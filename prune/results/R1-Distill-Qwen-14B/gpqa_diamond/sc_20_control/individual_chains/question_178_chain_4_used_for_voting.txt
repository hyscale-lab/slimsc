Okay, so I've got this question about a Lagrangian and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through step by step.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. I remember that σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], so that's the antisymmetric product of gamma matrices. F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, I think, since it's antisymmetric too.

Wait, no, wait. F^{μν} comes from the electromagnetic field, right? Like F_{μν} = ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ. So this must be some interaction term between a fermion (since there's ψ) and a vector field, like electromagnetism or maybe another gauge field.

But the question is about the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable.

I remember that in quantum field theory, for a theory to be renormalizable, the coupling constants must have positive mass dimensions. Because if they have negative dimensions, you get non-renormalizable interactions, which are higher-dimensional and not allowed in a renormalizable theory.

Wait, no, wait. The mass dimension of the coupling determines the renormalizability. If the coupling has a positive mass dimension, the interaction is renormalizable. If it's negative, it's non-renormalizable, which usually means that the interaction term has higher dimension in the Lagrangian, making the theory not renormalizable.

So first, I need to figure out the mass dimension of κ.

To find this, I should look at the dimensions of each term in the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 in four spacetime dimensions (since it's integrated over d^4x, and the action is dimensionless).

Each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4. So let's break down the term κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

First, let me recall the mass dimensions of each field. In four dimensions:

- Fermion fields ψ have mass dimension 3/2. Because the Dirac equation is first-order, so the kinetic term is ψ̄ iγ^μ ∂_μ ψ, which is dimension 4. Since ∂_μ has dimension 1, each ψ must be 3/2, because ψ̄ ψ (dimension 3) multiplied by ∂_μ (1) gives 4.

- The field F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for a gauge field. The gauge field A_μ has mass dimension 1. Because the kinetic term for A is like (∂A)^2, so each ∂A has dimension 2, squared gives 4, which matches the Lagrangian's dimension.

Wait, F^{μν} is ∂^μ A^ν - ∂^ν A^mu, so each term in F is ∂ A, which has dimension 1 + 1 = 2. So F itself has dimension 2.

Now, sigma_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_mu, gamma_nu]. The gamma matrices are dimensionless, as they're just matrices. So sigma_{mu nu} is dimensionless. Because each gamma is dimensionless, their commutator is dimensionless.

So putting it all together, the term is κ multiplied by ψ̄ sigma_{mu nu} psi, multiplied by F^{mu nu}.

Wait, let me count the dimensions of each part.

ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} ψ: ψ̄ is 3/2, σ is 0, ψ is 3/2. So together, their product is 3/2 + 0 + 3/2 = 3.

Then F^{mu nu} is dimension 2.

So the entire term is κ * (3) * (2) = κ *6? Wait, no, the dimensions multiply. Because each term in the product contributes their dimensions.

Wait, no, the dimensions of the term would be [κ] + [ψ̄ σ ψ] + [F]. Because it's a product, the dimensions add. Wait, no, because it's a product of fields, the dimensions add.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Each term in the product contributes their own dimension. So the term is κ times (ψ̄ σ ψ) times F.

Each part:

ψ̄ has 3/2, σ is dimensionless, ψ has 3/2. So ψ̄ σ ψ has (3/2) + (3/2) = 3.

F has dimension 2.

So the term is κ * (3) * (2) = κ *6. The product is dimension [κ] + 3 + 2 = [κ] +5.

But the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So the whole term must have dimension 4. Therefore:

[κ] +5 =4 → [κ] = -1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1. That would make it a dimensionful coupling.

Now, for renormalizability, the coupling should have positive mass dimension because each loop introduces factors of momentum, and higher dimension couplings (negative mass dimension) imply they become irrelevant (or marginal? Wait, maybe I'm getting this mixed up.) Wait, no, in a renormalizable theory, the coupling constants have mass dimension up to 4 in 4D because terms with higher dimensions would require higher powers of momentum in loops, leading to non-renormalizable terms.

Wait, I think the rule is that a coupling with mass dimension d is allowed in a renormalizable theory only if d >=0. Because for each loop, you can get more factors of momenta, and if the coupling has negative dimension, you can get divergences that you can't absorb with counterterms of the same form. Because if the coupling has negative mass dimension, like d=-1, then the counterterms would have to be multiplied by higher powers of momentum, which aren't present in the original Lagrangian. So the theory isn't renormalizable.

In our case, κ has dimension -1. So it's a non-renormalizable coupling. Because the dimension is negative.

So the theory isn't renormalizable. Because the coupling has negative mass dimension.

So looking at the options:

Option C: [κ] = -1, theory not renormalizable.

Option A: [κ]=-1, theory renormalizable. No, because it's non-renormalizable.

Wait, no. Wait, I thought that a coupling with positive dimension is renormalizable. Because for the interaction term, the dimension must be <=4. So the Lagrangian term must have dimension 4. So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

Let me think again about the mass dimension formula. The mass dimension of the coupling can be found by setting the entire term's dimension to 4.

Wait, the Lagrangian term is L = κ ψ̄ σ F ψ.

But perhaps I should break it down more systematically.

Each ψ has dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ is 3/2, σ is 0, so ψ̄ σ ψ is 3.

F has dimension 2.

So the product (ψ̄ σ ψ) F has dimension 3+2=5.

Multiply by κ, so the term is κ * 5. The dimension must be 4, so 5 + [κ] =4 → κ has dimension -1.

So κ is dimension -1. Since it's negative, the term is of higher dimension (dim 5), so it's a higher-dimensional operator, which makes the theory non-renormalizable.

Because renormalizable theories can only have terms with dimension ≤4. Any interaction term with higher dimension (like dimension 5) would need a coupling with negative mass dimension, which makes the theory non-renormalizable.

So the correct option is C: [κ]_M = -1, theory not renormalizable.

To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$ and $F^{\mu\nu}$ is the field strength tensor.

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of fields
In four spacetime dimensions:
- The fermion field $\psi$ has mass dimension $[\psi]_M = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension $[F^{\mu\nu}]_M = 2$ (since $F^{\mu\nu} \sim \partial_\mu A_\nu$, and $[\partial_\mu]_M = 1$, $[A_\mu]_M = 1$).

### Step 2: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
The term $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi$ has mass dimension:
\[
[\bar{\psi}]_M + [\psi]_M = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} = 3.
\]
Since $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is dimensionless, the product $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi$ has mass dimension $3$. Multiplying by $F^{\mu\nu}$ (dimension $2$), the entire term $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension:
\[
3 + 2 = 5.
\]
The Lagrangian must have mass dimension $4$ to ensure the action is dimensionless. Therefore, the coupling constant $\kappa$ must satisfy:
\[
[\kappa]_M + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa]_M = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. A coupling with a negative mass dimension corresponds to a higher-dimensional operator, which introduces non-renormalizable interactions. Since $[\kappa]_M = -1$, the theory is not renormalizable.

### Final Answer
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.
