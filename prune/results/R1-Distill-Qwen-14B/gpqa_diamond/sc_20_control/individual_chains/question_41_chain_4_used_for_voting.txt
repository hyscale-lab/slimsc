Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm. So, we have a light beam propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. And the question is, what's the speed of the light relative to the observer?

Wait, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is c/n, right? But wait, that's when the medium is stationary relative to the observer. But here, the medium (the glass) is moving. So, how does that affect the speed of light as measured by someone in the lab?

Let me think. I think I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula here because the speed of light is involved and the glass is moving at a significant velocity, though I don't know if v is a significant fraction of c. But the problem states to take c=1, so I guess we have to consider relativistic effects.

Wait, the speed of light in the glass is v_light = c/n. So in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at v_light. But the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light. So from the lab frame, what would the light's speed be?

Relativistic velocities don't just add linearly. So the formula for velocity addition is (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/(c²)). But wait, in this case, u is the velocity of the light in the glass's frame, which is v_light = c/n. So substituting, the speed relative to the lab would be (c/n + v) / (1 + (c/n) * v / c² )

Wait, let me compute that. Let's see, c is 1, so the expression becomes ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (1/n) * v )

Hmm, but wait, no. Because the direction is important. The glass is moving towards the observer. Wait, wait, the problem says the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. Oh, that's a bit confusing. So, the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity towards the observer. Wait, no: if the glass is moving towards the observer, then the beam is also moving towards the observer. So the direction is such that the beam and the glass's movement are in the same direction towards the observer.

Wait, maybe I should draw a diagram. So in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. The light inside the glass is moving at velocity u = c/n relative to the glass. But in which direction? Since the light is propagating through the glass, and the glass is moving towards the observer, the light's velocity relative to the lab would be the sum of the glass's velocity and the light's velocity relative to the glass.

Wait, but in the glass's frame, the light is moving at speed u = c/n. So in the lab frame, which is moving at speed v relative to the glass's frame, we need to apply the velocity addition formula.

Wait, no. The velocity addition formula is when you have two frames moving relative to each other. So, if the lab frame sees the glass moving at v (since the glass is moving toward the observer, but wait, the direction matters. Let me clarify: if the glass is moving towards the lab, then the velocity is negative? Or positive? Let's assume velocities are positive in the direction from glass towards observer. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the direction: the glass is moving toward the observer, so in the lab frame, the glass's velocity is +v (assuming the positive direction is towards the observer where the light is coming from). And the light inside the glass is moving towards the observer as well, so its speed relative to the glass is c/n towards the observer.

Wait, no, actually, the light is propagating through the glass. So when the glass is moving towards the observer, the light's velocity relative to the glass is towards the observer. So in the rest frame of the glass, the light is moving at u = c/n towards the observer.

So to find the light's speed in the lab frame, we can use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula is: u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/(c²)), but wait, I think I might have the signs wrong. Because if the glass is moving in the same direction as the light, but wait, if the observer is to the right, and the glass is moving towards the observer, then the glass's velocity is positive, and the light's velocity in the glass frame is also positive. So the formula would be:

u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/(c²))

But since u = c/n, and c=1, u = 1/n.

So substituting, u' = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + ( (1/n) * v ) )

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. Let me check the options again.

Option A: (1 +n v)/(n + v). Let's compute that.

If I factor the numerator and denominator, the expression I have is (1/n + v) / (1 + v/(n)). Let me multiply numerator and denominator by n to see if it simplifies.

Numerator: (1 + n v )

Denominator: (n + v )

So u’ = (1 + n v) / (n + v )

Wait, that's exactly option A. So according to that, the correct answer would be option A.

Wait, but wait a second. The velocity addition formula is for when the observer is moving relative to the source. Wait, no, more accurately, in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v, and the light's velocity in the glass is u. So the lab sees the light's velocity as u’ = [u + v]/[1 + (u v)/(c²)]. So with u = c/n =1/n, and c=1, so u’= [ (1/n) + v ] / [1 + ( (1/n) v ) ]

Multiply numerator and denominator by n: numerator becomes 1 + v n, denominator becomes n + v.

So u’ = (1 + n v)/(n + v )

Which matches option A.

Wait, but wait another thing. Since the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass, the relative motion would make the observed speed higher than 1/n. But according to the formula, the speed is (1 + n v)/(n + v). Let's test with v=0: then the speed is (1)/(n), which is correct, as expected.

Another test: if n=1 (vacuum), and v is some value. Wait, in vacuum, the speed should be c=1 regardless of the medium's movement, but wait, in reality, in vacuum the speed is always c, but I'm not sure if that applies here. Wait, if n=1, then the formula gives (1 + v )/(1 + v )=1, which aligns with the speed of light being c=1 in vacuum, regardless of the frame's movement. So that makes sense.

Wait, but I'm confused because earlier I thought of the velocity addition formula, but perhaps I should consider that the speed of light in the lab frame must still be c. But according to the formula I derived, it's (1 + n v)/(n + v). Which for non-zero v and n, might not be 1. Hmm, but that's a problem because in reality, the speed of light in a medium moving at velocity v shouldn't make the observed speed exceed c. But according to the formula, when n=1, it's 1, which is correct. But when n is not 1, could it give a speed higher than c? Let me see.

Suppose n=0.5, a hypothetical material where light speed is 2c (which is impossible, but just for the sake of calculation). So n=0.5, and v approaches a certain value. Let's say v=0.5. Then, the numerator becomes 1 + (0.5)(0.5) = 1 + 0.25=1.25. Denominator is 0.5 +0.5=1. So u’=1.25. But that's greater than c=1, which violates the laws of physics. So that can't be right. Therefore, my approach must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps the relativistic approach isn't applicable here because the medium's velocity v is not relativistic. Wait, but the problem didn't specify that v is small, so I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved with the Galilean velocity addition, which is u' = u + v.

Wait, but in Galilean terms, the speed would be (1/n) + v. But that's not one of the options. But wait, if we take the Galilean approach, that would neglect the fact that the speed of light is different in different media, but that's not correct because in reality, the speed of light in a medium is c/n, and the medium's motion affects the observed speed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the speed of light in the glass is v_light = c/n, and then the glass's movement adds to it. But that would be incorrect because the speed in the medium is already adjusted for the medium's properties. So perhaps the correct approach is to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. But then why does the formula lead to a speed exceeding c?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the direction. Let me think again. The glass is moving towards the observer, so perhaps the velocity of the glass is negative in the lab frame. Wait, no, in the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer, so its velocity is positive. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass, so the light's velocity in the glass frame is also positive. So when you add, it's u = 1/n, and the glass's velocity is v, so the lab sees the light's velocity as u’ = (1/n + v)/(1 + ( (1/n) * v )).

Wait, but why did I get a u’ greater than c when n is small? That can't be. So perhaps my initial approach is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to be solved using the relativistic approach, but perhaps the correct formula is different. Alternatively, perhaps the speed of light remains c in all frames, but that's only when the medium is moving at speed v in the same direction as the light.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when light is moving through a medium, the medium's motion affects the observed speed. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the observer in the lab. The observer would see the glass moving at velocity v towards them. The light inside the glass is moving at speed c/n relative to the glass. So from the lab's perspective, the speed of the light would be ?

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the relativistic velocity addition formula, but I must have applied it correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved with non-relativistic (classical) mechanics, but that would imply that the speed is simply 1/n + v, which doesn't match any of the options except perhaps when n=1.

But looking back, the options include option B (1), which would imply that the speed is always c, regardless of the glass's motion. But that's only true in a vacuum. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the situation again. The light is moving through the glass, which is itself moving. The index of refraction is n, so the speed of light in the glass is c/n. But when the glass is moving, how does that affect the observed speed?

Wait, maybe the problem is a trick question. Because according to the theory of relativity, the speed of light in a medium depends on the frame of reference. But I'm a bit rusty on this.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is option B, 1, because the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. But wait, that's only true in a vacuum. Because in a medium, the speed is lower. Wait, but if the medium is moving, would the speed of light in the medium change as observed in the lab frame?

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's try to think of it differently. Suppose the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. The speed of light in the glass is c/n in the glass's frame. So in the lab frame, what's the speed?

Wait, the formula for velocity addition is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c² )

So u = c/n =1/n, so u' = (1/n + v ) / (1 + ( (1/n) * v ) )

Multiply numerator and denominator by n: (1 + n v )/(n + v )

Which is option A. So according to that, the speed is (1 + n v)/(n + v )

But wait, earlier when I considered n=0.5 and v=0.5, the speed becomes (1 + 0.5*0.5)/(0.5 +0.5) → (1.25)/(1) =1.25, which is greater than c=1. That can't be possible because you can't exceed the speed of light.

Ah, so that suggests that either my approach is wrong, or the problem is designed with non-relativistic speeds in mind, where v is small enough that relativistic effects are negligible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using the Galilean addition, which gives u’ = u + v. So in that case, the speed would be (1/n) + v, but that's not one of the options except when n=1. So that approach doesn't fit.

Wait, looking back at the options, option A gives (1 +n v)/(n +v ), which when n is large (like glass with n=1.5), and v is small, would approach 1/(n) as v approaches zero. So that makes sense.

But why does the formula allow for speeds exceeding c? Perhaps because the problem assumes that the glass's velocity is non-relativistic, so v is much smaller than c, and the speed (1 +n v)/(n +v ) would be approximately (1/(n)) + v (1/(n^2 )) ), which is the Galilean approximation. But even then, it's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the relativistic formula and accept that the answer is option A. But I'm not entirely confident because of the earlier problem where the speed might exceed c.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the direction of velocity. If the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction, then their velocities add. But perhaps in reality, when the medium is moving, the speed of light in the medium as seen from the lab is (n² + v n)/(n + v n² ) or something else.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's think about the velocity of the light as measured in the lab. The light is moving through the glass which is itself moving. So the speed of the light in the lab frame would be the speed of the glass plus the speed of the light relative to the glass.

But wait, that's the Galilean approach, which is only valid at non-relativistic speeds. So if v is much smaller than c, this approach might be acceptable. So the speed would be (c/n ) + v.

But that's not one of the options either. Wait, option A: (1 +n v)/(n +v ). Let me compute that for small v. Let me expand this expression for small v. Using a Taylor expansion, (1 +n v)/(n +v ) = (1 +n v )/(n (1 + v/(n) )) ) ≈ [1 +n v ]/(n) [1 - v/(n) ] ≈ (1/n) [1 +n v - v ] - (1/n) [ (n v)(v/(n)) ) ] ?

Wait, perhaps it's better to do the expansion as (1 +n v)/(n +v ) = [1/(n)] [ (1 +n v )/(1 + v/n ) ] ≈ [1/(n)] [ (1 +n v ) (1 - v/n + (v^2)/(n²) - ... ) ]

Wait, for small v, higher order terms can be neglected. So it becomes approximately [1/(n)] [1 +n v - v/n + ... ]

Which is [1/(n)] [1 + (n - 1/n ) v ]

But this seems a bit messy. Alternatively, when v is small, (1 +n v)/(n +v ) = (n v +1)/(n +v ) = [1 +n v ]/(n (1 + v/(n)) ) ≈ (1/(n))(1 +n v )(1 - v/(n) ) ) ≈ (1/n)(1 +n v -v/n + ... )

Which is approximately (1/n)(1 + v (n -1/n ) )

Wait, but for small v, the leading term is 1/n, and the correction is v (n -1/n ), which is (n^2 -1)/n^2 * v.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B) 1, but that would only be the case if the medium is moving at speed v in the same direction as the light, but that's not possible because the speed of light in a medium is c/n, and the medium's motion would affect it. But according to relativity, the speed of light in a vacuum is always c, and in a medium, it's c/n in the medium's frame.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to use the relativistic velocity addition formula, and the correct answer is option A.

Wait, but then why when n=1, it gives 1, which is correct. And when n is large, the speed tends to 1/n, which is correct. So perhaps the correct answer is option A.

The problem involves determining the speed of light in a glass medium relative to an observer in the laboratory, where the glass is moving at a constant velocity \(v\) in the same direction as the light beam and toward the observer. The index of refraction of the glass is \(n\), and the speed of light in a vacuum is \(c = 1\).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Speed of Light in the Glass**:  
   In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is \(u = \frac{1}{n}\), as the speed of light in a medium is given by \(c/n\).

2. **Relativistic Velocity Addition**:  
   Since the glass is moving at velocity \(v\) relative to the laboratory frame, the relativistic velocity addition formula must be used to determine the speed of light in the lab frame:
   \[
   u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + \frac{u v}{c^2}}
   \]
   Substituting \(u = \frac{1}{n}\) and \(c = 1\), the formula becomes:
   \[
   u' = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
   \]

3. **Simplification**:  
   Multiply the numerator and denominator by \(n\) to simplify:
   \[
   u' = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
   \]

4. **Verification Against Options**:  
   Comparing the derived expression with the given options, it matches **Option A**:
   \[
   \text{Option A: } \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
   \]

5. **Consistency Checks**:  
   - For \(v = 0\), the speed reduces to \(\frac{1}{n}\), which is correct.  
   - For \(n = 1\) (vacuum), the speed is always 1, consistent with the invariance of the speed of light in a vacuum.  
   - The derived formula is dimensionally consistent and aligns with relativistic principles.

### Conclusion:
The speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is given by \(\frac{1 + n v}{n + v}\), which corresponds to **Option A**.

Answer: A

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm. So, we have a light beam propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. And the question is, what's the speed of the light relative to the observer?

Wait, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is c/n, right? But wait, that's when the medium is stationary relative to the observer. But here, the medium (the glass) is moving. So, how does that affect the speed of light as measured by someone in the lab?

Let me think. I think I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula here because the speed of light is involved and the glass is moving at a significant velocity, though I don't know if v is a significant fraction of c. But the problem states to take c=1, so I guess we have to consider relativistic effects.

Wait, the speed of light in the glass is v_light = c/n. So in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at v_light. But the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light. So from the lab frame, what would the light's speed be?

Relativistic velocities don't just add linearly. So the formula for velocity addition is (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/(c²)). But wait, in this case, u is the velocity of the light in the glass's frame, which is v_light = c/n. So substituting, the speed relative to the lab would be (c/n + v) / (1 + (c/n) * v / c² )

Wait, let me compute that. Let's see, c is 1, so the expression becomes ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (1/n) * v )

Hmm, but wait, no. Because the direction is important. The glass is moving towards the observer. Wait, wait, the problem says the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. Oh, that's a bit confusing. So, the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity towards the observer. Wait, no: if the glass is moving towards the observer, then the beam is also moving towards the observer. So the direction is such that the beam and the glass's movement are in the same direction towards the observer.

Wait, maybe I should draw a diagram. So in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. The light inside the glass is moving at velocity u = c/n relative to the glass. But in which direction? Since the light is propagating through the glass, and the glass is moving towards the observer, the light's velocity relative to the lab would be the sum of the glass's velocity and the light's velocity relative to the glass.

Wait, but in the glass's frame, the light is moving at speed u = c/n. So in the lab frame, which is moving at speed v relative to the glass's frame, we need to apply the velocity addition formula.

Wait, no. The velocity addition formula is when you have two frames moving relative to each other. So, if the lab frame sees the glass moving at v (since the glass is moving toward the observer, but wait, the direction matters. Let me clarify: if the glass is moving towards the lab, then the velocity is negative? Or positive? Let's assume velocities are positive in the direction from glass towards observer. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the direction: the glass is moving toward the observer, so in the lab frame, the glass's velocity is +v (assuming the positive direction is towards the observer where the light is coming from). And the light inside the glass is moving towards the observer as well, so its speed relative to the glass is c/n towards the observer.

Wait, no, actually, the light is propagating through the glass. So when the glass is moving towards the observer, the light's velocity relative to the glass is towards the observer. So in the rest frame of the glass, the light is moving at u = c/n towards the observer.

So to find the light's speed in the lab frame, we can use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula is: u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/(c²)), but wait, I think I might have the signs wrong. Because if the glass is moving in the same direction as the light, but wait, if the observer is to the right, and the glass is moving towards the observer, then the glass's velocity is positive, and the light's velocity in the glass frame is also positive. So the formula would be:

u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/(c²))

But since u = c/n, and c=1, u = 1/n.

So substituting, u' = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + ( (1/n) * v ) )

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. Let me check the options again.

Option A: (1 +n v)/(n + v). Let's compute that.

If I factor the numerator and denominator, the expression I have is (1/n + v) / (1 + v/(n)). Let me multiply numerator and denominator by n to see if it simplifies.

Numerator: (1 + n v )

Denominator: (n + v )

So u’ = (1 + n v) / (n + v )

Wait, that's exactly option A. So according to that, the correct answer would be option A.

Wait, but wait a second. The velocity addition formula is for when the observer is moving relative to the source. Wait, no, more accurately, in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v, and the light's velocity in the glass is u. So the lab sees the light's velocity as u’ = [u + v]/[1 + (u v)/(c²)]. So with u = c/n =1/n, and c=1, so u’= [ (1/n) + v ] / [1 + ( (1/n) v ) ]

Multiply numerator and denominator by n: numerator becomes 1 + v n, denominator becomes n + v.

So u’ = (1 + n v)/(n + v )

Which matches option A.

Wait, but wait another thing. Since the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass, the relative motion would make the observed speed higher than 1/n. But according to the formula, the speed is (1 + n v)/(n + v). Let's test with v=0: then the speed is (1)/(n), which is correct, as expected.

Another test: if n=1 (vacuum), and v is some value. Wait, in vacuum, the speed should be c=1 regardless of the medium's movement, but wait, in reality, in vacuum the speed is always c, but I'm not sure if that applies here. Wait, if n=1, then the formula gives (1 + v )/(1 + v )=1, which aligns with the speed of light being c=1 in vacuum, regardless of the frame's movement. So that makes sense.

Wait, but I'm confused because earlier I thought of the velocity addition formula, but perhaps I should consider that the speed of light in the lab frame must still be c. But according to the formula I derived, it's (1 + n v)/(n + v). Which for non-zero v and n, might not be 1. Hmm, but that's a problem because in reality, the speed of light in a medium moving at velocity v shouldn't make the observed speed exceed c. But according to the formula, when n=1, it's 1, which is correct. But when n is not 1, could it give a speed higher than c? Let me see.

Suppose n=0.5, a hypothetical material where light speed is 2c (which is impossible, but just for the sake of calculation). So n=0.5, and v approaches a certain value. Let's say v=0.5. Then, the numerator becomes 1 + (0.5)(0.5) = 1 + 0.25=1.25. Denominator is 0.5 +0.5=1. So u’=1.25. But that's greater than c=1, which violates the laws of physics. So that can't be right. Therefore, my approach must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps the relativistic approach isn't applicable here because the medium's velocity v is not relativistic. Wait, but the problem didn't specify that v is small, so I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved with the Galilean velocity addition, which is u' = u + v.

Wait, but in Galilean terms, the speed would be (1/n) + v. But that's not one of the options. But wait, if we take the Galilean approach, that would neglect the fact that the speed of light is different in different media, but that's not correct because in reality, the speed of light in a medium is c/n, and the medium's motion affects the observed speed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the speed of light in the glass is v_light = c/n, and then the glass's movement adds to it. But that would be incorrect because the speed in the medium is already adjusted for the medium's properties. So perhaps the correct approach is to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. But then why does the formula lead to a speed exceeding c?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the direction. Let me think again. The glass is moving towards the observer, so perhaps the velocity of the glass is negative in the lab frame. Wait, no, in the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer, so its velocity is positive. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass, so the light's velocity in the glass frame is also positive. So when you add, it's u = 1/n, and the glass's velocity is v, so the lab sees the light's velocity as u’ = (1/n + v)/(1 + ( (1/n) * v )).

Wait, but why did I get a u’ greater than c when n is small? That can't be. So perhaps my initial approach is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to be solved using the relativistic approach, but perhaps the correct formula is different. Alternatively, perhaps the speed of light remains c in all frames, but that's only when the medium is moving at speed v in the same direction as the light.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when light is moving through a medium, the medium's motion affects the observed speed. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the observer in the lab. The observer would see the glass moving at velocity v towards them. The light inside the glass is moving at speed c/n relative to the glass. So from the lab's perspective, the speed of the light would be ?

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the relativistic velocity addition formula, but I must have applied it correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved with non-relativistic (classical) mechanics, but that would imply that the speed is simply 1/n + v, which doesn't match any of the options except perhaps when n=1.

But looking back, the options include option B (1), which would imply that the speed is always c, regardless of the glass's motion. But that's only true in a vacuum. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the situation again. The light is moving through the glass, which is itself moving. The index of refraction is n, so the speed of light in the glass is c/n. But when the glass is moving, how does that affect the observed speed?

Wait, maybe the problem is a trick question. Because according to the theory of relativity, the speed of light in a medium depends on the frame of reference. But I'm a bit rusty on this.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is option B, 1, because the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. But wait, that's only true in a vacuum. Because in a medium, the speed is lower. Wait, but if the medium is moving, would the speed of light in the medium change as observed in the lab frame?

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's try to think of it differently. Suppose the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. The speed of light in the glass is c/n in the glass's frame. So in the lab frame, what's the speed?

Wait, the formula for velocity addition is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c² )

So u = c/n =1/n, so u' = (1/n + v ) / (1 + ( (1/n) * v ) )

Multiply numerator and denominator by n: (1 + n v )/(n + v )

Which is option A. So according to that, the speed is (1 + n v)/(n + v )

But wait, earlier when I considered n=0.5 and v=0.5, the speed becomes (1 + 0.5*0.5)/(0.5 +0.5) → (1.25)/(1) =1.25, which is greater than c=1. That can't be possible because you can't exceed the speed of light.

Ah, so that suggests that either my approach is wrong, or the problem is designed with non-relativistic speeds in mind, where v is small enough that relativistic effects are negligible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using the Galilean addition, which gives u’ = u + v. So in that case, the speed would be (1/n) + v, but that's not one of the options except when n=1. So that approach doesn't fit.

Wait, looking back at the options, option A gives (1 +n v)/(n +v ), which when n is large (like glass with n=1.5), and v is small, would approach 1/(n) as v approaches zero. So that makes sense.

But why does the formula allow for speeds exceeding c? Perhaps because the problem assumes that the glass's velocity is non-relativistic, so v is much smaller than c, and the speed (1 +n v)/(n +v ) would be approximately (1/(n)) + v (1/(n^2 )) ), which is the Galilean approximation. But even then, it's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the relativistic formula and accept that the answer is option A. But I'm not entirely confident because of the earlier problem where the speed might exceed c.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the direction of velocity. If the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction, then their velocities add. But perhaps in reality, when the medium is moving, the speed of light in the medium as seen from the lab is (n² + v n)/(n + v n² ) or something else.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's think about the velocity of the light as measured in the lab. The light is moving through the glass which is itself moving. So the speed of the light in the lab frame would be the speed of the glass plus the speed of the light relative to the glass.

But wait, that's the Galilean approach, which is only valid at non-relativistic speeds. So if v is much smaller than c, this approach might be acceptable. So the speed would be (c/n ) + v.

But that's not one of the options either. Wait, option A: (1 +n v)/(n +v ). Let me compute that for small v. Let me expand this expression for small v. Using a Taylor expansion, (1 +n v)/(n +v ) = (1 +n v )/(n (1 + v/(n) )) ) ≈ [1 +n v ]/(n) [1 - v/(n) ] ≈ (1/n) [1 +n v - v ] - (1/n) [ (n v)(v/(n)) ) ] ?

Wait, perhaps it's better to do the expansion as (1 +n v)/(n +v ) = [1/(n)] [ (1 +n v )/(1 + v/n ) ] ≈ [1/(n)] [ (1 +n v ) (1 - v/n + (v^2)/(n²) - ... ) ]

Wait, for small v, higher order terms can be neglected. So it becomes approximately [1/(n)] [1 +n v - v/n + ... ]

Which is [1/(n)] [1 + (n - 1/n ) v ]

But this seems a bit messy. Alternatively, when v is small, (1 +n v)/(n +v ) = (n v +1)/(n +v ) = [1 +n v ]/(n (1 + v/(n)) ) ≈ (1/(n))(1 +n v )(1 - v/(n) ) ) ≈ (1/n)(1 +n v -v/n + ... )

Which is approximately (1/n)(1 + v (n -1/n ) )

Wait, but for small v, the leading term is 1/n, and the correction is v (n -1/n ), which is (n^2 -1)/n^2 * v.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B) 1, but that would only be the case if the medium is moving at speed v in the same direction as the light, but that's not possible because the speed of light in a medium is c/n, and the medium's motion would affect it. But according to relativity, the speed of light in a vacuum is always c, and in a medium, it's c/n in the medium's frame.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to use the relativistic velocity addition formula, and the correct answer is option A.

Wait, but then why when n=1, it gives 1, which is correct. And when n is large, the speed tends to 1/n, which is correct. So perhaps the correct answer is option A.


The problem involves determining the speed of light in a glass medium relative to an observer in the laboratory, where the glass is moving at a constant velocity \(v\) in the same direction as the light beam and toward the observer. The index of refraction of the glass is \(n\), and the speed of light in a vacuum is \(c = 1\).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Speed of Light in the Glass**:  
   In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is \(u = \frac{1}{n}\), as the speed of light in a medium is given by \(c/n\).

2. **Relativistic Velocity Addition**:  
   Since the glass is moving at velocity \(v\) relative to the laboratory frame, the relativistic velocity addition formula must be used to determine the speed of light in the lab frame:
   \[
   u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + \frac{u v}{c^2}}
   \]
   Substituting \(u = \frac{1}{n}\) and \(c = 1\), the formula becomes:
   \[
   u' = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
   \]

3. **Simplification**:  
   Multiply the numerator and denominator by \(n\) to simplify:
   \[
   u' = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
   \]

4. **Verification Against Options**:  
   Comparing the derived expression with the given options, it matches **Option A**:
   \[
   \text{Option A: } \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
   \]

5. **Consistency Checks**:  
   - For \(v = 0\), the speed reduces to \(\frac{1}{n}\), which is correct.  
   - For \(n = 1\) (vacuum), the speed is always 1, consistent with the invariance of the speed of light in a vacuum.  
   - The derived formula is dimensionally consistent and aligns with relativistic principles.

### Conclusion:
The speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is given by \(\frac{1 + n v}{n + v}\), which corresponds to **Option A**.
