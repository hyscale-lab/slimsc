Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem involves two electrons in p orbitals. Each p orbital has an angular momentum quantum number l=1. So each electron has l1=1 and l2=1. The question is about their coupled angular momentum state, which is given as |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, wait. Let me think about what these quantum numbers mean.

So the state is written as |l1, l2, l, m>. I know that l1 and l2 are the individual orbital angular momenta of each electron. When you couple two angular momenta, the total angular momentum quantum number l can range from |l1 - l2| to l1 + l2. Since both are 1, the possible l values are 0, 1, 2. Here, the state has l=2. So the total orbital angular momentum is 2ħ.

The m value is the projection of the total angular momentum along a chosen axis. So m is given as -1. That means the total Lz is -1ħ, because m is the eigenvalue for Lz divided by ħ. Oh wait, the eigenvalue is mħ. So in this state, the total Lz is -ħ.

Now, the question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z. Each of these is the z-component of each electron's orbital angular momentum. The possible eigenvalues for L1z are m1ħ where m1 can be -1, 0, +1. Same for L2z.

The question asks for the joint probability that both measurements yield -ħ. So we're looking for the probability that L1z = -ħ and L2z = -ħ.

Hmm. How do I approach this? I remember that when you have a coupled state, it's a combination of uncoupled states. So the |l1, l2, l, m> state is a linear combination of |l1, m1> ⊗ |l2, m2> states where m1 + m2 = m.

Wait, the given state is |1,1,2,-1>. So in this state, the total m is -1. So when we expand this state in terms of the product states of m1 and m2, each term must have m1 + m2 = -1.

Wait, but each product state is |m1> |m2>, so their m's add up to the total m.

So the given state is a combination of all possible |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1. But since l1=1 and l2=1, the individual m's can be -1, 0, +1.

So the possible (m1, m2) pairs that sum to -1 are:

(-1, 0), (0, -1), (0, -1), etc. Wait, let's list them:

- m1 = -1, m2 = 0 → sum is -1.
- m1 = 0, m2 = -1 → sum is -1.
- m1 = 1, m2 = -2 → but wait, m2 can't be -2 since l2 is 1. So that's invalid.
- Similarly, m1 = -2 is not possible because l1=1. So only two valid pairs: (-1,0) and (0,-1).

Wait, but wait again. For m1 and m2 each can be -1, 0, +1. So for m_total = m1 + m2 = -1, the possible (m1, m2) pairs are:

1. m1 = -1, m2 = 0 → sum -1.
2. m1 = 0, m2 = -1 → sum -1.
3. m1 = -1, m2 = 0 → same as first.
Wait, no, I think that's all because any other combination would have m1 + m2 not equal to -1.

Wait, but wait, does m1=1 and m2=-2 work? No, because m2 can't be less than -1. So only two possible product states contribute to the |l=2, m=-1> state.

Wait, but wait another moment. For two l=1 particles, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients will determine how the product states combine into the coupled states.

But perhaps I don't need to get into the coefficients. The problem is about the probability of measuring both L1z and L2z as -ħ. That would mean m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. Because L1z is m1 * ħ, so if m1 is -1, L1z is -ħ. Similarly for m2.

So the question becomes: what is the probability that, in the state |1,1,2,-1>, both m1 and m2 are -1?

But wait, in the state |1,1,2,-1>, the total m is -1. So m1 + m2 = -1. If both m1 and m2 are -1, their sum is -2. But the total m in the state is -1. So that's impossible.

Wait, so the condition m1 + m2 = -1 must be satisfied. If both m1 and m2 are -1, then m1 + m2 = -2, which doesn't equal -1. Therefore, in the given state, the product state where m1 = -1 and m2 = -1 doesn't contribute. So the probability is zero.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The given state is |l=2, m=-1>. So any product state |m1, m2> that contributes to this coupled state must have m1 + m2 = -1. So the product states that can be part of this are those with (m1, m2) pairs adding to -1. The pair (-1, 0) and (0, -1) are the only possibilities because other combinations would require m beyond the allowed values.

But (m1, m2) = (-1, -1) sums to -2, which doesn't match m_total = -1. Therefore, the product state |m1=-1, m2=-1> is not part of the |l=2, m=-1> state. So the amplitude for that product state is zero.

Thus, the probability of measuring both m1 and m2 as -1 is zero.

Wait, but wait again. What if the state |1,1,2,-1> includes any combination of m1 and m2 that sum to -1. So the product states involved are |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

So when you expand the coupled state, these two product states are the only ones contributing. Therefore, the state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of these two product states.

So the coefficients for these must be non-zero. But the product state where m1=-1 and m2=-1 is not included because their sum would be -2, not -1. So the probability of both being -1 is zero.

Therefore, the joint probability is zero. So the answer is D) 0.

The problem involves two electrons in p orbitals, each with orbital angular momentum quantum number \( l_1 = l_2 = 1 \). The coupled angular momentum state is given as \( |1,1,2,-1\rangle \), where \( l_1 \) and \( l_2 \) are the individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers, \( l = 2 \) is the total angular momentum quantum number, and \( m = -1 \) is the total projection quantum number along the z-axis.

The question asks for the joint probability of measuring \( L_{1z} = -\hbar \) and \( L_{2z} = -\hbar \). For \( L_{1z} \) and \( L_{2z} \), the eigenvalues correspond to \( m_1 \hbar \) and \( m_2 \hbar \), respectively. Measuring \( L_{1z} = -\hbar \) and \( L_{2z} = -\hbar \) implies \( m_1 = -1 \) and \( m_2 = -1 \).

In the coupled state \( |1,1,2,-1\rangle \), the total projection \( m = m_1 + m_2 \) must equal \( -1 \). If \( m_1 = -1 \) and \( m_2 = -1 \), their sum would be \( m = -2 \), which does not match the total \( m = -1 \) of the given state. Therefore, the product state \( |m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\rangle \) does not contribute to the \( |1,1,2,-1\rangle \) state.

The coupled state \( |1,1,2,-1\rangle \) is a linear combination of product states where \( m_1 + m_2 = -1 \). The valid pairs are \( (m_1, m_2) = (-1, 0) \) and \( (0, -1) \). The product state \( |m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\rangle \) is excluded because it does not satisfy \( m_1 + m_2 = -1 \). Thus, the probability of measuring \( L_{1z} = -\hbar \) and \( L_{2z} = -\hbar \) is zero.

- m1 = 0, m2 = -1 → sum is -1.
- m1 = 1, m2 = -2 → but wait, m2 can't be -2 since l2 is 1. So that's invalid.

1. m1 = -1, m2 = 0 → sum -1.
2. m1 = 0, m2 = -1 → sum -1.
3. m1 = -1, m2 = 0 → same as first.
Wait, no, I think that's all because any other combination would have m1 + m2 not equal to -1.

Wait, but wait, does m1=1 and m2=-2 work? No, because m2 can't be less than -1. So only two possible product states contribute to the |l=2, m=-1> state.

Wait, but wait another moment. For two l=1 particles, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients will determine how the product states combine into the coupled states.

But perhaps I don't need to get into the coefficients. The problem is about the probability of measuring both L1z and L2z as -ħ. That would mean m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. Because L1z is m1 * ħ, so if m1 is -1, L1z is -ħ. Similarly for m2.

So the question becomes: what is the probability that, in the state |1,1,2,-1>, both m1 and m2 are -1?

But wait, in the state |1,1,2,-1>, the total m is -1. So m1 + m2 = -1. If both m1 and m2 are -1, their sum is -2. But the total m in the state is -1. So that's impossible.

Wait, so the condition m1 + m2 = -1 must be satisfied. If both m1 and m2 are -1, then m1 + m2 = -2, which doesn't equal -1. Therefore, in the given state, the product state where m1 = -1 and m2 = -1 doesn't contribute. So the probability is zero.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The given state is |l=2, m=-1>. So any product state |m1, m2> that contributes to this coupled state must have m1 + m2 = -1. So the product states that can be part of this are those with (m1, m2) pairs adding to -1. The pair (-1, 0) and (0, -1) are the only possibilities because other combinations would require m beyond the allowed values.

But (m1, m2) = (-1, -1) sums to -2, which doesn't match m_total = -1. Therefore, the product state |m1=-1, m2=-1> is not part of the |l=2, m=-1> state. So the amplitude for that product state is zero.

Thus, the probability of measuring both m1 and m2 as -1 is zero.

Wait, but wait again. What if the state |1,1,2,-1> includes any combination of m1 and m2 that sum to -1. So the product states involved are |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

So when you expand the coupled state, these two product states are the only ones contributing. Therefore, the state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of these two product states.

So the coefficients for these must be non-zero. But the product state where m1=-1 and m2=-1 is not included because their sum would be -2, not -1. So the probability of both being -1 is zero.

Therefore, the joint probability is zero. So the answer is D) 0.


The problem involves two electrons in p orbitals, each with orbital angular momentum quantum number \( l_1 = l_2 = 1 \). The coupled angular momentum state is given as \( |1,1,2,-1\rangle \), where \( l_1 \) and \( l_2 \) are the individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers, \( l = 2 \) is the total angular momentum quantum number, and \( m = -1 \) is the total projection quantum number along the z-axis.

For \( L_{1z} \) and \( L_{2z} \), the eigenvalues correspond to \( m_1 \hbar \) and \( m_2 \hbar \), respectively. Measuring \( L_{1z} = -\hbar \) and \( L_{2z} = -\hbar \) implies \( m_1 = -1 \) and \( m_2 = -1 \).

In the coupled state \( |1,1,2,-1\rangle \), the total projection \( m = m_1 + m_2 \) must equal \( -1 \). If \( m_1 = -1 \) and \( m_2 = -1 \), their sum would be \( m = -2 \), which does not match the total \( m = -1 \) of the given state. Therefore, the product state \( |m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\rangle \) does not contribute to the \( |1,1,2,-1\rangle \) state.

The coupled state \( |1,1,2,-1\rangle \) is a linear combination of product states where \( m_1 + m_2 = -1 \). The valid pairs are \( (m_1, m_2) = (-1, 0) \) and \( (0, -1) \). The product state \( |m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\rangle \) is excluded because it does not satisfy \( m_1 + m_2 = -1 \).
