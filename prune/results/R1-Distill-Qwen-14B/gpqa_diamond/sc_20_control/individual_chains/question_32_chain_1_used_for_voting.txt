Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) where the speed of a nucleus is 0.96c. Hmm, the nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to figure out what the nucleus is. Li is lithium, right? And if it has 3 neutrons, that means it's lithium-6 because lithium typically has an atomic number of 3 (so 3 protons). So Li-6 has 3 protons + 3 neutrons, making it a nucleus with 6 nucleons. Wait, no—wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. Let me double-check that. The atomic number for lithium is 3, so number of protons is 3. If it has 3 neutrons, then the mass number is 3 + 3 = 6. So the nucleus is Li-6.

Now, the problem is about relativistic energy. The speed is given as 0.96c, which is pretty high. So I need to calculate the total energy of the nucleus. I remember that in relativity, the total energy is given by gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy.

So gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me plug in v = 0.96c. So v squared is (0.96c)^2, which is (0.9216)c². So 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784). Hmm, what's the square root of 0.0784? Let me think—0.28 squared is 0.0784, right? Because 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me compute that: 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Wait, because 0.28 times 3.5714 is about 1. So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, but I should be precise here because the options are given to four decimal places. Let me recalculate that more accurately. Let's compute 1 - (0.96)^2. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is exactly 0.28, because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = 3.57142857... So approximately 3.5714.

Next, I need the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The rest mass energy is mc², where m is the rest mass. But what's the mass of Li-6?

I think the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.015 atomic mass units (u). Wait, I'm not too sure about the exact number. Let me think—remember that the mass of a nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 1.007 u. So for Li-6, with 6 nucleons, the rest mass would be approximately 6 * 1.007 u. Let me calculate that: 6 * 1.007 = 6.042 u. But wait, Li-6's actual mass is a bit less because binding energy causes a slight mass deficit. Oh wait, wait, no, the rest mass is the sum of the parts minus binding energy (but for the purpose of this problem, perhaps we can approximate it as 6 * 1.007276 u, which is the mass of a proton or neutron? Or perhaps it's better to look up the exact value.)

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact atomic mass from a table. Let me recall that the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.0160293 u. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact value, but for the sake of this problem, let's proceed. So m = 6.01603 u.

But wait, another approach: perhaps the mass is given as the mass of the nucleus. So the nucleus of Li-6 has 6 nucleons (3 protons, 3 neutrons). The mass of a proton is about 1.007276 u, and a neutron is about 1.008665 u. So let's compute the total mass:

3 protons: 3 * 1.007276 = 3.021828 u
3 neutrons: 3 * 1.008665 = 3.025995 u
Total = 3.021828 + 3.025995 = 6.047823 u

Wait, but that's the mass if the nucleus isn't bound. However, in reality, the mass of the nucleus is less due to binding energy. But when calculating the rest mass energy for a particle in a collider, probably the correct approach is to use the actual measured mass of the nucleus. So instead of assuming each nucleon's mass and adding, I should look up the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem expects me to use the mass of a single nucleon, like a proton or neutron, but given that the nucleus is Li-6, perhaps the mass is approximately 6 * m_p, where m_p is the proton mass. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the mass of a deuteron or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of the nucleus as the sum of the individual nucleon masses, but that would give a higher mass than the actual nucleus.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Let's think again. The problem says the nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons, so it's Li-6. The mass of the Li-6 nucleus in atomic mass units is about 6.01603 u. So m = 6.01603 u.

Now, I need to convert that into energy in GeV. Because the rest mass energy is mc². So first, I need to find the mass in kilograms, multiply by c squared, and then convert to GeV.

But perhaps a better approach is to use the conversion factor 1 u ≈ 931.5 MeV/c². So 1 u equals about 931.5 million electron volts divided by c squared. So, to find the rest mass energy in GeV, I can multiply the mass in u by 931.5 MeV/u, then convert to GeV.

So m = 6.01603 u.

Energy (rest) E_rest = m * c² = 6.01603 u * 931.5 MeV/u. Let me compute that:

6.01603 * 931.5 ≈ let's calculate this step by step.

First, 6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV.

0.01603 * 931.5 ≈ let's compute 0.01 * 931.5 = 9.315, and 0.00603 * 931.5 ≈ approximately 5.624.

So 9.315 + 5.624 ≈ 14.939.

So total E_rest ≈ 5589 + 14.939 ≈ 5603.939 MeV, which is about 5.603939 GeV.

Wait, that seems high. Wait, wait—because 1 u is 931.5 MeV/c², so 6 u would be about 5.589 GeV, and 6.016 would be a bit more, around 5.6 GeV. That makes sense.

So E_rest ≈ 5.6039 GeV.

Now, the total energy is gamma times E_rest. Gamma is approximately 3.5714.

So E_total = gamma * E_rest = 3.5714 * 5.6039 ≈ let's compute that.

First, 3 *5.6039 is 16.8117.

0.5714 *5.6039: Let me compute 0.5 *5.6039 = 2.80195; 0.0714 *5.6039 ≈ 0.4006.

So 2.80195 + 0.4006 ≈ 3.20255.

Adding to 16.8117: 16.8117 + 3.20255 ≈ 20.01425 GeV.

Wait, that gets me approximately 20.014 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, and option D is 21.419 GeV. Hmm, so my approximate calculation is about 20.014 GeV, which is close to option C.

Wait, but perhaps my approximation for gamma was too rough. Let me compute gamma more accurately. Let me redo the calculation of gamma.

Given v = 0.96c, v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c². So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is exactly 0.28 because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = 3.57142857... So more precisely, 3.57142857.

Now, more accurately, E_rest is 6.01603 u * 931.5 MeV/u.

Let me compute that more precisely. 6.01603 * 931.5 = ?

First, 6 * 931.5 = 5589.

0.01603 * 931.5 = ?

Compute 0.01 * 931.5 = 9.315

0.00603 * 931.5 = ?

0.006 * 931.5 = 5.589

0.00003 * 931.5 = 0.027945

So 5.589 + 0.027945 = 5.616945.

So 0.00603 * 931.5 ≈ 5.616945.

So 0.01603 * 931.5 = 9.315 + 5.616945 ≈ 14.931945.

So total E_rest = 5589 + 14.931945 ≈ 5603.931945 MeV → 5.603931945 GeV.

Now, E_total = gamma * E_rest = 3.57142857 * 5.603931945.

Let me compute this product more precisely.

3.57142857 × 5.603931945:

Let me break this down.

3.57142857 ×5 = 17.85714285

3.57142857 ×0.603931945:

Compute 3.57142857 ×0.6 = 2.142857142

3.57142857 ×0.003931945 ≈ approximately 0.013999999.

So adding these together: 2.142857142 + 0.013999999 ≈ 2.15685714.

So total E_total ≈ 17.85714285 + 2.15685714 ≈ 20.014 GeV.

Wait, that's about 20.014 GeV. But none of the options exactly match that. Let's look back at the options:

Option C is 20.132 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps I made an error in the calculation of gamma or the rest mass energy.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the nucleus is moving and the kinetic energy is being asked, but the problem says the energy of the RHIC, which is typically the total energy, not just the kinetic. Because in colliders, the kinetic energy is what's provided, but the total energy is gamma * m c². But perhaps the question is about the kinetic energy. Wait, the question says: "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?"

Wait, I'm a bit confused about what the question is asking. The RHIC accelerates ions to a certain speed, and the energy refers to the kinetic energy, or the total energy? Because in particle physics, when they talk about the energy of a collider, they usually refer to the kinetic energy. But sometimes, it's the total energy. Hmm.

Wait, the problem states: "the energy of the RHIC is so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?" So perhaps it's referring to the kinetic energy.

Wait, if the question is about the kinetic energy, then the formula would be E_kinetic = (gamma - 1) * m c².

So let's recalculate that.

E_kinetic = (3.57142857 - 1) * 5.603931945 GeV.

So that's 2.57142857 * 5.603931945.

Compute 2 *5.603931945 =11.20786389

0.57142857 * 5.603931945 ≈ Let's compute that.

0.5 *5.603931945 = 2.801965973

0.07142857 *5.603931945 ≈ 0.400689655.

Adding them: 2.801965973 + 0.400689655 ≈ 3.202655628.

So E_kinetic ≈ 11.20786389 +3.202655628 ≈14.4105 GeV.

Hmm, that gives me about 14.41 GeV, which isn't one of the options. So perhaps the question is asking for the total energy, which would be gamma times rest mass energy. So the prior calculation was about 20.014 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close to my calculation of 20.014. But perhaps I made a mistake in the mass of Li-6. Let me double-check that. Maybe the exact mass of Li-6 is a bit different.

I think the standard atomic weight of Li-6 is approximately 6.0160293 u. Let me use that more precisely.

So m = 6.0160293 u.

E_rest = m * c² = 6.0160293 u *931.5 MeV/u → 6.0160293 *931.5 = ?

Compute this:

6 *931.5 =5589 MeV.

0.0160293 *931.5 = ?

0.01 *931.5 =9.315.

0.0060293 *931.5 = let's compute:

0.006 *931.5 =5.589.

0.0000293 *931.5=0.02724995 ≈0.02725.

So 5.589 +0.02725=5.61625.

Adding to 9.315: 9.315 +5.61625=14.93125 MeV.

So E_rest=5589 +14.93125=5603.93125 MeV →5.60393125 GeV.

Now, gamma is 3.57142857.

So E_total =3.57142857 *5.60393125 GeV.

Let me compute this precisely.

3.57142857 *5.60393125:

Let me compute 3 *5.60393125 =16.81179375.

0.57142857 *5.60393125.

Compute 0.5 *5.60393125 =2.801965625.

0.07142857 *5.60393125.

Hmm, 0.07 *5.60393125=0.3922751875.

0.00142857 *5.60393125 ≈ approximately 0.007999999.

So 0.07142857 *5.60393125 ≈ 0.3922751875 +0.007999999 ≈0.400275187.

So 0.57142857 *5.60393125 ≈2.801965625 +0.400275187 ≈3.202240812.

So adding to the 3 * part: 16.81179375 +3.202240812 ≈20.01403456 GeV.

So approximately 20.014 GeV.

Looking back at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Hmm. So where am I going wrong here?

Wait, perhaps the mass of the nucleus isn't exactly 6.01603 u. Let me check that. Li-6's exact mass is 6.0160293 u. So that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the mass is taken as the sum of the individual nucleon masses, which would be:

3 protons: 3 *1.007276 =3.021828 u
3 neutrons:3 *1.008665=3.025995 u
Total:6.047823 u.

Wait, but that's higher than the actual nucleus mass because binding energy reduces the mass. So the actual mass is about 6.01603 u, which is less than 6.047823 u.

Wait, but if I use 6.047823 u, then E_rest would be 6.047823 *931.5 MeV.

Let me compute that.

6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

0.047823 *931.5 = let's compute:

0.04 *931.5=37.26 MeV.

0.007823 *931.5 ≈7.283 MeV.

So 37.26 +7.283≈44.543 MeV.

So E_rest =5589 +44.543 =5633.543 MeV →5.633543 GeV.

Now, gamma is 3.57142857.

E_total =3.57142857 *5.633543.

Let me compute that:

3 *5.633543 =16.900629.

0.57142857 *5.633543.

Compute 0.5 *5.633543=2.8167715.

0.07142857 *5.633543≈0.40468 (because 0.07 *5.633543≈0.394348, and 0.00142857 *5.633543≈0.00809 → sum≈0.402438).

So 0.57142857 *5.633543≈2.8167715 +0.402438≈3.2192095.

Adding to the 3 * part:16.900629 +3.2192095≈20.119838 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 20.1198 GeV, which is closer to option C's 20.132 GeV. But why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the rest mass as the sum of the protons and neutrons, ignoring binding energy. Because sometimes in such problems, they approximate the nucleus mass as the sum of individual nucleons, even though that's not exactly correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Wait, I'm confident that gamma is 3.57142857. Let me recheck the calculation with E_rest as 5.633543 GeV.

E_total =3.57142857 *5.633543.

Let me compute this product precisely.

3.57142857 ×5.633543.

Break it down into:

3 ×5.633543 =16.900629.

0.57142857 ×5.633543.

Compute:

0.5 ×5.633543 =2.8167715.

0.07142857 ×5.633543.

Compute:

0.07 ×5.633543 =0.394348.

0.00142857 ×5.633543 ≈0.007999999.

So sum is 0.394348 +0.007999999=0.402347999.

So 0.57142857 ×5.633543=2.8167715 +0.402347999=3.219119499 GeV.

Total E_total=16.900629 +3.219119499=20.119748499 GeV ≈20.1197 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.12 GeV. The option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close. So perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, but why did I get a different result when I used the actual nucleus mass versus the sum of nucleons? Because the problem states it's the nucleus X, which is Li with 3 neutrons, so it's Li-6. So the correct approach is to use the actual nuclear mass, not the sum of individual nucleons.

Wait, but then my initial calculation with the correct mass gave me about 20.014 GeV, which isn't exactly matching any of the options. But the options are A) 18.475, B)23.069, C)20.132, D)21.419.

Hmm, maybe I should compute gamma more accurately. Wait, I used gamma as 3.57142857, but perhaps I should calculate it more precisely. Let me compute gamma again.

Given v = 0.96c.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784).

Now, sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28, so gamma is exactly 10/2.8=3.57142857...

So no error there.

Wait, but maybe the problem expects the kinetic energy instead of the total energy. Let me recompute the kinetic energy.

E_kinetic = (gamma -1) * m c².

So if m c² is 5.60393125 GeV, then:

E_kinetic = (3.57142857 -1) *5.60393125 =2.57142857 *5.60393125.

Calculating that:

2 *5.60393125=11.2078625.

0.57142857 *5.60393125.

Compute 0.5 *5.60393125=2.801965625.

0.07142857 *5.60393125= let's compute:

0.07 *5.60393125=0.3922751875.

0.00142857 *5.60393125≈0.007999999.

Sum:0.3922751875 +0.007999999≈0.4002751865.

So 0.57142857 *5.60393125≈2.801965625 +0.4002751865≈3.2022408115.

So E_kinetic ≈11.2078625 +3.2022408115≈14.41010331 GeV.

Which isn't matching any options either.

Another thought: perhaps the question refers to the kinetic energy per nucleon, but that doesn't make much sense because the nucleus is moving as a whole.

Alternatively, maybe the mass used is different. Let me think: for Li-6, the exact mass is 6.0160293 u. But perhaps the problem is using the mass of a single Li-6 nucleus as approximately 6 u, leading to E_rest =6 *931.5 =5589 MeV =5.589 GeV. Then gamma is 3.57142857, so E_total=3.57142857 *5.589 GeV.

Compute that.

3.57142857 *5.589.

3 *5.589=16.767.

0.57142857 *5.589.

0.5 *5.589=2.7945.

0.07142857 *5.589≈0.4005.

So 2.7945 +0.4005≈3.195.

Total E_total=16.767 +3.195≈20. (approximately 20. (16.767 +3.195=19.962 GeV). Hmm, close to 20 GeV again.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of a single nucleon. For example, if the nucleus is moving at 0.96c, perhaps the energy is per nucleon, but that's not what the question says. The question is about the energy of the nucleus, not per nucleon.

Wait, another thought. The problem says "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." The RHIC accelerates heavy ions, and the energy is usually given per ion. So perhaps we're correct to use the entire nucleus's mass.

So going back, when I calculated E_total as approximately 20.014 GeV with the precise mass, but the options don't have that. The closest is option C at 20.132 GeV.

Wait, maybe I should calculate gamma more precisely. I know that 0.96^2 is 0.9216, but perhaps I should compute 1/sqrt(1 -0.96^2) more accurately.

Wait, let's compute 1 -0.96^2 again. 0.96^2 is 0.9216. So 1 -0.9216=0.0784.

The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly, so gamma is 1/0.28=3.57142857... So that's precise. So perhaps the issue is that I should calculate the rest mass energy more accurately.

Wait, let me check the exact value of Li-6's mass. I found it's 6.0160293 u. So using that, the rest mass energy is 6.0160293 *931.5 MeV.

Let me compute that accurately.

6.0160293 *931.5 = ?

Compute 6 *931.5 =5589.

0.0160293 *931.5 = ?

Compute 0.01*931.5=9.315.

0.0060293 *931.5= let's compute:

931.5 *0.006=5.589.

931.5 *0.0000293=approx 0.02725 (since 931.5 *0.00003=0.027945, so 0.0000293 is about 0.02725).

So 5.589 +0.02725=5.61625.

So 0.0160293 *931.5=9.315 +5.61625=14.93125.

So E_rest =5589 +14.93125=5603.93125 MeV →5.60393125 GeV.

Then, E_total=3.57142857 *5.60393125 GeV.

Calculating this precisely:

3.57142857 *5.60393125.

Let me compute this using more precise steps.

Multiply 5.60393125 by 3.57142857.

We can represent 3.57142857 as (3 + 0.57142857).

So,

5.60393125 *3 =16.81179375.

5.60393125 *0.57142857.

Compute 5.60393125 *0.5 =2.801965625.

5.60393125 *0.07142857.

Compute 5.60393125 *0.07 =0.3922751875.

5.60393125 *0.00142857 ≈ 0.008000000 (approx 0.008 exactly, since 0.00142857 is 1/700 ≈0.00142857, so 5.60393125 *1/700 = approximately 0.008005616).

So 0.3922751875 +0.008005616 ≈0.4002808035.

So 5.60393125 *0.57142857 ≈2.801965625 +0.4002808035 =3.2022464285.

So total E_total =16.81179375 +3.2022464285 =20.0140391785 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.014 GeV.

But the option C is 20.132 GeV, which is about 0.118 GeV higher. That's about 118 MeV, which is significant. So either I'm missing something, or perhaps the problem expects a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the speed is not exactly 0.96c. Let me think again about the calculation of gamma. Wait, no, the speed is given as 0.96c, so that's correct.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem is referring to the kinetic energy. Let me compute the kinetic energy again.

E_kinetic = (gamma -1) * E_rest.

So (3.57142857 - 1) =2.57142857.

E_kinetic =2.57142857 *5.60393125 GeV.

Compute 2 *5.60393125=11.2078625.

0.57142857 *5.60393125.

As before, this is about 3.2022464285 GeV.

So E_kinetic ≈11.2078625 +3.2022464285≈14.4101089 GeV.

Which doesn't match any options.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the total energy but using the rest mass as 6 u, not the precise 6.0160293 u.

So E_rest =6.0000000 *931.5 =5589 MeV=5.589 GeV.

E_total =3.57142857 *5.589.

Compute:

3 *5.589 =16.767.

0.57142857 *5.589 = let's compute.

0.5 *5.589 =2.7945.

0.07142857 *5.589 =0.4005.

So total 2.7945 +0.4005=3.195.

So E_total=16.767 +3.195=19.962 GeV ≈19.96 GeV.

Which is close to option C (20.132 GeV) but not exactly.

Wait, 19.96 GeV is about 19.96, which is not an option. The options are A) 18.475, B)23.069, C)20.132, D)21.419.

So perhaps I'm miscalculating something else.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem refers to the kinetic energy per nucleon, but that seems unlikely. Or perhaps the problem is using the mass of the entire Li atom, including electrons. But Li-6 has 3 electrons, whose mass is negligible compared to the nucleus, so that's probably not it.

Another possibility: perhaps I should use the exact calculation of gamma. Let me compute gamma more precisely.

Wait, v =0.96c.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2 )

Which is 1 / sqrt(0.0784) =1/0.28=3.5714285714.

No error there.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass energy is calculated as 6 * (proton mass + neutron mass)/2, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the rest mass is taken as the sum of protons and neutrons, not considering binding energy.

Wait, for a Li-6 nucleus: 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The sum of their rest masses is 3*(1.007276 u) +3*(1.008665 u) = 3*1.007276=3.021828, 3*1.008665=3.025995. Sum is 6.047823 u.

So E_rest =6.047823 *931.5 MeV = 5633.543 MeV =5.633543 GeV.

Then, E_total=3.57142857 *5.633543 GeV.

Compute that:

3 *5.633543 =16.900629.

0.57142857 *5.633543.

0.5 *5.633543=2.8167715.

0.07142857 *5.633543 ≈0.402347999.

So total 2.8167715 +0.402347999=3.219119499.

Adding to 16.900629: 16.900629 +3.219119499=20.1197485 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.1197 GeV. So option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close. So perhaps the correct answer is C.

But why did using the actual mass give me around 20.014 GeV, which is not an option, whereas using the sum of nucleon masses gives me 20.1197, close to option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the sum of the individual nucleon masses, which is 6.047823 u.

But that would make the rest mass energy higher, leading to a higher total energy. So perhaps that's the approach the problem expects, even though it's an approximation.

So in that case, the total energy would be approximately 20.1197 GeV, which rounds to 20.12 GeV. The option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem expects me to use the relativistic kinetic energy formula, which is:

K = (gamma -1) * m c².

So using the same numbers, but that gives me around 14.41 GeV, which doesn't match any options.

Hmm. I think the answer is option C, 20.132 GeV. So I'll go with that.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the lithium-6 (Li-6) nucleus is 0.96c, we calculate the total energy of the nucleus using relativistic mechanics. The total energy is given by:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), \( m \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus
The Li-6 nucleus consists of 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Using the atomic mass of Li-6 (\( 6.0160293 \, u \)) and the conversion factor \( 1 \, u = 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \), the rest mass energy is:

\[
E_{\text{rest}} = m c^2 = 6.0160293 \, u \times 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/u = 5603.93125 \, \text{MeV} = 5.60393125 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy
The total energy is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = \gamma E_{\text{rest}} = 3.5714 \times 5.60393125 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Breaking this calculation into parts:

\[
3 \times 5.60393125 = 16.81179375 \, \text{GeV}
\]
\[
0.5714 \times 5.60393125 \approx 3.20224643 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Adding these together:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = 16.81179375 + 3.20224643 \approx 20.01403917 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated total energy is approximately \( 20.014 \, \text{GeV} \). However, none of the options exactly match this value. The closest option is **C) 20.132 GeV**, which is slightly higher. This discrepancy may arise from approximations or assumptions in the problem setup, such as using the sum of individual nucleon masses instead of the precise nuclear mass.

### Conclusion
Based on the calculations and the provided options, the most reasonable answer is:

**Answer: C**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) where the speed of a nucleus is 0.96c. Hmm, the nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to figure out what the nucleus is. Li is lithium, right? And if it has 3 neutrons, that means it's lithium-6 because lithium typically has an atomic number of 3 (so 3 protons). So Li-6 has 3 protons + 3 neutrons, making it a nucleus with 6 nucleons. Wait, no—wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. Let me double-check that. The atomic number for lithium is 3, so number of protons is 3. If it has 3 neutrons, then the mass number is 3 + 3 = 6. So the nucleus is Li-6.

Now, the problem is about relativistic energy. The speed is given as 0.96c, which is pretty high. So I need to calculate the total energy of the nucleus. I remember that in relativity, the total energy is given by gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy.

So gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me plug in v = 0.96c. So v squared is (0.96c)^2, which is (0.9216)c². So 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784). Hmm, what's the square root of 0.0784? Let me think—0.28 squared is 0.0784, right? Because 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me compute that: 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Wait, because 0.28 times 3.5714 is about 1. So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, but I should be precise here because the options are given to four decimal places. Let me recalculate that more accurately. Let's compute 1 - (0.96)^2. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is exactly 0.28, because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = 3.57142857... So approximately 3.5714.

Next, I need the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The rest mass energy is mc², where m is the rest mass. But what's the mass of Li-6?

I think the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.015 atomic mass units (u). Wait, I'm not too sure about the exact number. Let me think—remember that the mass of a nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 1.007 u. So for Li-6, with 6 nucleons, the rest mass would be approximately 6 * 1.007 u. Let me calculate that: 6 * 1.007 = 6.042 u. But wait, Li-6's actual mass is a bit less because binding energy causes a slight mass deficit. Oh wait, wait, no, the rest mass is the sum of the parts minus binding energy (but for the purpose of this problem, perhaps we can approximate it as 6 * 1.007276 u, which is the mass of a proton or neutron? Or perhaps it's better to look up the exact value.)

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact atomic mass from a table. Let me recall that the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.0160293 u. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact value, but for the sake of this problem, let's proceed. So m = 6.01603 u.

But wait, another approach: perhaps the mass is given as the mass of the nucleus. So the nucleus of Li-6 has 6 nucleons (3 protons, 3 neutrons). The mass of a proton is about 1.007276 u, and a neutron is about 1.008665 u. So let's compute the total mass:

3 protons: 3 * 1.007276 = 3.021828 u
3 neutrons: 3 * 1.008665 = 3.025995 u
Total = 3.021828 + 3.025995 = 6.047823 u

Wait, but that's the mass if the nucleus isn't bound. However, in reality, the mass of the nucleus is less due to binding energy. But when calculating the rest mass energy for a particle in a collider, probably the correct approach is to use the actual measured mass of the nucleus. So instead of assuming each nucleon's mass and adding, I should look up the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem expects me to use the mass of a single nucleon, like a proton or neutron, but given that the nucleus is Li-6, perhaps the mass is approximately 6 * m_p, where m_p is the proton mass. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the mass of a deuteron or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of the nucleus as the sum of the individual nucleon masses, but that would give a higher mass than the actual nucleus.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Let's think again. The problem says the nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons, so it's Li-6. The mass of the Li-6 nucleus in atomic mass units is about 6.01603 u. So m = 6.01603 u.

Now, I need to convert that into energy in GeV. Because the rest mass energy is mc². So first, I need to find the mass in kilograms, multiply by c squared, and then convert to GeV.

But perhaps a better approach is to use the conversion factor 1 u ≈ 931.5 MeV/c². So 1 u equals about 931.5 million electron volts divided by c squared. So, to find the rest mass energy in GeV, I can multiply the mass in u by 931.5 MeV/u, then convert to GeV.

So m = 6.01603 u.

Energy (rest) E_rest = m * c² = 6.01603 u * 931.5 MeV/u. Let me compute that:

6.01603 * 931.5 ≈ let's calculate this step by step.

First, 6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV.

0.01603 * 931.5 ≈ let's compute 0.01 * 931.5 = 9.315, and 0.00603 * 931.5 ≈ approximately 5.624.

So 9.315 + 5.624 ≈ 14.939.

So total E_rest ≈ 5589 + 14.939 ≈ 5603.939 MeV, which is about 5.603939 GeV.

Wait, that seems high. Wait, wait—because 1 u is 931.5 MeV/c², so 6 u would be about 5.589 GeV, and 6.016 would be a bit more, around 5.6 GeV. That makes sense.

So E_rest ≈ 5.6039 GeV.

Now, the total energy is gamma times E_rest. Gamma is approximately 3.5714.

So E_total = gamma * E_rest = 3.5714 * 5.6039 ≈ let's compute that.

First, 3 *5.6039 is 16.8117.

0.5714 *5.6039: Let me compute 0.5 *5.6039 = 2.80195; 0.0714 *5.6039 ≈ 0.4006.

So 2.80195 + 0.4006 ≈ 3.20255.

Adding to 16.8117: 16.8117 + 3.20255 ≈ 20.01425 GeV.

Wait, that gets me approximately 20.014 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, and option D is 21.419 GeV. Hmm, so my approximate calculation is about 20.014 GeV, which is close to option C.

Wait, but perhaps my approximation for gamma was too rough. Let me compute gamma more accurately. Let me redo the calculation of gamma.

Given v = 0.96c, v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c². So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is exactly 0.28 because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = 3.57142857... So more precisely, 3.57142857.

Now, more accurately, E_rest is 6.01603 u * 931.5 MeV/u.

Let me compute that more precisely. 6.01603 * 931.5 = ?

First, 6 * 931.5 = 5589.

0.01603 * 931.5 = ?

Compute 0.01 * 931.5 = 9.315

0.00603 * 931.5 = ?

0.006 * 931.5 = 5.589

0.00003 * 931.5 = 0.027945

So 5.589 + 0.027945 = 5.616945.

So 0.00603 * 931.5 ≈ 5.616945.

So 0.01603 * 931.5 = 9.315 + 5.616945 ≈ 14.931945.

So total E_rest = 5589 + 14.931945 ≈ 5603.931945 MeV → 5.603931945 GeV.

Now, E_total = gamma * E_rest = 3.57142857 * 5.603931945.

Let me compute this product more precisely.

3.57142857 × 5.603931945:

Let me break this down.

3.57142857 ×5 = 17.85714285

3.57142857 ×0.603931945:

Compute 3.57142857 ×0.6 = 2.142857142

3.57142857 ×0.003931945 ≈ approximately 0.013999999.

So adding these together: 2.142857142 + 0.013999999 ≈ 2.15685714.

So total E_total ≈ 17.85714285 + 2.15685714 ≈ 20.014 GeV.

Wait, that's about 20.014 GeV. But none of the options exactly match that. Let's look back at the options:

Option C is 20.132 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps I made an error in the calculation of gamma or the rest mass energy.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the nucleus is moving and the kinetic energy is being asked, but the problem says the energy of the RHIC, which is typically the total energy, not just the kinetic. Because in colliders, the kinetic energy is what's provided, but the total energy is gamma * m c². But perhaps the question is about the kinetic energy. Wait, the question says: "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?"

Wait, I'm a bit confused about what the question is asking. The RHIC accelerates ions to a certain speed, and the energy refers to the kinetic energy, or the total energy? Because in particle physics, when they talk about the energy of a collider, they usually refer to the kinetic energy. But sometimes, it's the total energy. Hmm.

Wait, the problem states: "the energy of the RHIC is so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?" So perhaps it's referring to the kinetic energy.

Wait, if the question is about the kinetic energy, then the formula would be E_kinetic = (gamma - 1) * m c².

So let's recalculate that.

E_kinetic = (3.57142857 - 1) * 5.603931945 GeV.

So that's 2.57142857 * 5.603931945.

Compute 2 *5.603931945 =11.20786389

0.57142857 * 5.603931945 ≈ Let's compute that.

0.5 *5.603931945 = 2.801965973

0.07142857 *5.603931945 ≈ 0.400689655.

Adding them: 2.801965973 + 0.400689655 ≈ 3.202655628.

So E_kinetic ≈ 11.20786389 +3.202655628 ≈14.4105 GeV.

Hmm, that gives me about 14.41 GeV, which isn't one of the options. So perhaps the question is asking for the total energy, which would be gamma times rest mass energy. So the prior calculation was about 20.014 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close to my calculation of 20.014. But perhaps I made a mistake in the mass of Li-6. Let me double-check that. Maybe the exact mass of Li-6 is a bit different.

I think the standard atomic weight of Li-6 is approximately 6.0160293 u. Let me use that more precisely.

So m = 6.0160293 u.

E_rest = m * c² = 6.0160293 u *931.5 MeV/u → 6.0160293 *931.5 = ?

Compute this:

6 *931.5 =5589 MeV.

0.0160293 *931.5 = ?

0.01 *931.5 =9.315.

0.0060293 *931.5 = let's compute:

0.006 *931.5 =5.589.

0.0000293 *931.5=0.02724995 ≈0.02725.

So 5.589 +0.02725=5.61625.

Adding to 9.315: 9.315 +5.61625=14.93125 MeV.

So E_rest=5589 +14.93125=5603.93125 MeV →5.60393125 GeV.

Now, gamma is 3.57142857.

So E_total =3.57142857 *5.60393125 GeV.

Let me compute this precisely.

3.57142857 *5.60393125:

Let me compute 3 *5.60393125 =16.81179375.

0.57142857 *5.60393125.

Compute 0.5 *5.60393125 =2.801965625.

0.07142857 *5.60393125.

Hmm, 0.07 *5.60393125=0.3922751875.

0.00142857 *5.60393125 ≈ approximately 0.007999999.

So 0.07142857 *5.60393125 ≈ 0.3922751875 +0.007999999 ≈0.400275187.

So 0.57142857 *5.60393125 ≈2.801965625 +0.400275187 ≈3.202240812.

So adding to the 3 * part: 16.81179375 +3.202240812 ≈20.01403456 GeV.

So approximately 20.014 GeV.

Looking back at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Hmm. So where am I going wrong here?

Wait, perhaps the mass of the nucleus isn't exactly 6.01603 u. Let me check that. Li-6's exact mass is 6.0160293 u. So that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the mass is taken as the sum of the individual nucleon masses, which would be:

3 protons: 3 *1.007276 =3.021828 u
3 neutrons:3 *1.008665=3.025995 u
Total:6.047823 u.

Wait, but that's higher than the actual nucleus mass because binding energy reduces the mass. So the actual mass is about 6.01603 u, which is less than 6.047823 u.

Wait, but if I use 6.047823 u, then E_rest would be 6.047823 *931.5 MeV.

Let me compute that.

6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

0.047823 *931.5 = let's compute:

0.04 *931.5=37.26 MeV.

0.007823 *931.5 ≈7.283 MeV.

So 37.26 +7.283≈44.543 MeV.

So E_rest =5589 +44.543 =5633.543 MeV →5.633543 GeV.

Now, gamma is 3.57142857.

E_total =3.57142857 *5.633543.

Let me compute that:

3 *5.633543 =16.900629.

0.57142857 *5.633543.

Compute 0.5 *5.633543=2.8167715.

0.07142857 *5.633543≈0.40468 (because 0.07 *5.633543≈0.394348, and 0.00142857 *5.633543≈0.00809 → sum≈0.402438).

So 0.57142857 *5.633543≈2.8167715 +0.402438≈3.2192095.

Adding to the 3 * part:16.900629 +3.2192095≈20.119838 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 20.1198 GeV, which is closer to option C's 20.132 GeV. But why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the rest mass as the sum of the protons and neutrons, ignoring binding energy. Because sometimes in such problems, they approximate the nucleus mass as the sum of individual nucleons, even though that's not exactly correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Wait, I'm confident that gamma is 3.57142857. Let me recheck the calculation with E_rest as 5.633543 GeV.

E_total =3.57142857 *5.633543.

Let me compute this product precisely.

3.57142857 ×5.633543.

Break it down into:

3 ×5.633543 =16.900629.

0.57142857 ×5.633543.

Compute:

0.5 ×5.633543 =2.8167715.

0.07142857 ×5.633543.

Compute:

0.07 ×5.633543 =0.394348.

0.00142857 ×5.633543 ≈0.007999999.

So sum is 0.394348 +0.007999999=0.402347999.

So 0.57142857 ×5.633543=2.8167715 +0.402347999=3.219119499 GeV.

Total E_total=16.900629 +3.219119499=20.119748499 GeV ≈20.1197 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.12 GeV. The option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close. So perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, but why did I get a different result when I used the actual nucleus mass versus the sum of nucleons? Because the problem states it's the nucleus X, which is Li with 3 neutrons, so it's Li-6. So the correct approach is to use the actual nuclear mass, not the sum of individual nucleons.

Wait, but then my initial calculation with the correct mass gave me about 20.014 GeV, which isn't exactly matching any of the options. But the options are A) 18.475, B)23.069, C)20.132, D)21.419.

Hmm, maybe I should compute gamma more accurately. Wait, I used gamma as 3.57142857, but perhaps I should calculate it more precisely. Let me compute gamma again.

Given v = 0.96c.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784).

Now, sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28, so gamma is exactly 10/2.8=3.57142857...

So no error there.

Wait, but maybe the problem expects the kinetic energy instead of the total energy. Let me recompute the kinetic energy.

E_kinetic = (gamma -1) * m c².

So if m c² is 5.60393125 GeV, then:

E_kinetic = (3.57142857 -1) *5.60393125 =2.57142857 *5.60393125.

Calculating that:

2 *5.60393125=11.2078625.

0.57142857 *5.60393125.

Compute 0.5 *5.60393125=2.801965625.

0.07142857 *5.60393125= let's compute:

0.07 *5.60393125=0.3922751875.

0.00142857 *5.60393125≈0.007999999.

Sum:0.3922751875 +0.007999999≈0.4002751865.

So 0.57142857 *5.60393125≈2.801965625 +0.4002751865≈3.2022408115.

So E_kinetic ≈11.2078625 +3.2022408115≈14.41010331 GeV.

Which isn't matching any options either.

Another thought: perhaps the question refers to the kinetic energy per nucleon, but that doesn't make much sense because the nucleus is moving as a whole.

Alternatively, maybe the mass used is different. Let me think: for Li-6, the exact mass is 6.0160293 u. But perhaps the problem is using the mass of a single Li-6 nucleus as approximately 6 u, leading to E_rest =6 *931.5 =5589 MeV =5.589 GeV. Then gamma is 3.57142857, so E_total=3.57142857 *5.589 GeV.

Compute that.

3.57142857 *5.589.

3 *5.589=16.767.

0.57142857 *5.589.

0.5 *5.589=2.7945.

0.07142857 *5.589≈0.4005.

So 2.7945 +0.4005≈3.195.

Total E_total=16.767 +3.195≈20. (approximately 20. (16.767 +3.195=19.962 GeV). Hmm, close to 20 GeV again.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of a single nucleon. For example, if the nucleus is moving at 0.96c, perhaps the energy is per nucleon, but that's not what the question says. The question is about the energy of the nucleus, not per nucleon.

Wait, another thought. The problem says "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." The RHIC accelerates heavy ions, and the energy is usually given per ion. So perhaps we're correct to use the entire nucleus's mass.

So going back, when I calculated E_total as approximately 20.014 GeV with the precise mass, but the options don't have that. The closest is option C at 20.132 GeV.

Wait, maybe I should calculate gamma more precisely. I know that 0.96^2 is 0.9216, but perhaps I should compute 1/sqrt(1 -0.96^2) more accurately.

Wait, let's compute 1 -0.96^2 again. 0.96^2 is 0.9216. So 1 -0.9216=0.0784.

The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly, so gamma is 1/0.28=3.57142857... So that's precise. So perhaps the issue is that I should calculate the rest mass energy more accurately.

Wait, let me check the exact value of Li-6's mass. I found it's 6.0160293 u. So using that, the rest mass energy is 6.0160293 *931.5 MeV.

Let me compute that accurately.

6.0160293 *931.5 = ?

Compute 6 *931.5 =5589.

0.0160293 *931.5 = ?

Compute 0.01*931.5=9.315.

0.0060293 *931.5= let's compute:

931.5 *0.006=5.589.

931.5 *0.0000293=approx 0.02725 (since 931.5 *0.00003=0.027945, so 0.0000293 is about 0.02725).

So 5.589 +0.02725=5.61625.

So 0.0160293 *931.5=9.315 +5.61625=14.93125.

So E_rest =5589 +14.93125=5603.93125 MeV →5.60393125 GeV.

Then, E_total=3.57142857 *5.60393125 GeV.

Calculating this precisely:

3.57142857 *5.60393125.

Let me compute this using more precise steps.

Multiply 5.60393125 by 3.57142857.

We can represent 3.57142857 as (3 + 0.57142857).

So,

5.60393125 *3 =16.81179375.

5.60393125 *0.57142857.

Compute 5.60393125 *0.5 =2.801965625.

5.60393125 *0.07142857.

Compute 5.60393125 *0.07 =0.3922751875.

5.60393125 *0.00142857 ≈ 0.008000000 (approx 0.008 exactly, since 0.00142857 is 1/700 ≈0.00142857, so 5.60393125 *1/700 = approximately 0.008005616).

So 0.3922751875 +0.008005616 ≈0.4002808035.

So 5.60393125 *0.57142857 ≈2.801965625 +0.4002808035 =3.2022464285.

So total E_total =16.81179375 +3.2022464285 =20.0140391785 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.014 GeV.

But the option C is 20.132 GeV, which is about 0.118 GeV higher. That's about 118 MeV, which is significant. So either I'm missing something, or perhaps the problem expects a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the speed is not exactly 0.96c. Let me think again about the calculation of gamma. Wait, no, the speed is given as 0.96c, so that's correct.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem is referring to the kinetic energy. Let me compute the kinetic energy again.

E_kinetic = (gamma -1) * E_rest.

So (3.57142857 - 1) =2.57142857.

E_kinetic =2.57142857 *5.60393125 GeV.

Compute 2 *5.60393125=11.2078625.

0.57142857 *5.60393125.

As before, this is about 3.2022464285 GeV.

So E_kinetic ≈11.2078625 +3.2022464285≈14.4101089 GeV.

Which doesn't match any options.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the total energy but using the rest mass as 6 u, not the precise 6.0160293 u.

So E_rest =6.0000000 *931.5 =5589 MeV=5.589 GeV.

E_total =3.57142857 *5.589.

Compute:

3 *5.589 =16.767.

0.57142857 *5.589 = let's compute.

0.5 *5.589 =2.7945.

0.07142857 *5.589 =0.4005.

So total 2.7945 +0.4005=3.195.

So E_total=16.767 +3.195=19.962 GeV ≈19.96 GeV.

Which is close to option C (20.132 GeV) but not exactly.

Wait, 19.96 GeV is about 19.96, which is not an option. The options are A) 18.475, B)23.069, C)20.132, D)21.419.

So perhaps I'm miscalculating something else.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem refers to the kinetic energy per nucleon, but that seems unlikely. Or perhaps the problem is using the mass of the entire Li atom, including electrons. But Li-6 has 3 electrons, whose mass is negligible compared to the nucleus, so that's probably not it.

Another possibility: perhaps I should use the exact calculation of gamma. Let me compute gamma more precisely.

Wait, v =0.96c.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2 )

Which is 1 / sqrt(0.0784) =1/0.28=3.5714285714.

No error there.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass energy is calculated as 6 * (proton mass + neutron mass)/2, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the rest mass is taken as the sum of protons and neutrons, not considering binding energy.

Wait, for a Li-6 nucleus: 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The sum of their rest masses is 3*(1.007276 u) +3*(1.008665 u) = 3*1.007276=3.021828, 3*1.008665=3.025995. Sum is 6.047823 u.

So E_rest =6.047823 *931.5 MeV = 5633.543 MeV =5.633543 GeV.

Then, E_total=3.57142857 *5.633543 GeV.

Compute that:

3 *5.633543 =16.900629.

0.57142857 *5.633543.

0.5 *5.633543=2.8167715.

0.07142857 *5.633543 ≈0.402347999.

So total 2.8167715 +0.402347999=3.219119499.

Adding to 16.900629: 16.900629 +3.219119499=20.1197485 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.1197 GeV. So option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close. So perhaps the correct answer is C.

But why did using the actual mass give me around 20.014 GeV, which is not an option, whereas using the sum of nucleon masses gives me 20.1197, close to option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the sum of the individual nucleon masses, which is 6.047823 u.

But that would make the rest mass energy higher, leading to a higher total energy. So perhaps that's the approach the problem expects, even though it's an approximation.

So in that case, the total energy would be approximately 20.1197 GeV, which rounds to 20.12 GeV. The option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem expects me to use the relativistic kinetic energy formula, which is:

K = (gamma -1) * m c².

So using the same numbers, but that gives me around 14.41 GeV, which doesn't match any options.

Hmm. I think the answer is option C, 20.132 GeV. So I'll go with that.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the lithium-6 (Li-6) nucleus is 0.96c, we calculate the total energy of the nucleus using relativistic mechanics. The total energy is given by:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), \( m \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus
The Li-6 nucleus consists of 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Using the atomic mass of Li-6 (\( 6.0160293 \, u \)) and the conversion factor \( 1 \, u = 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \), the rest mass energy is:

\[
E_{\text{rest}} = m c^2 = 6.0160293 \, u \times 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/u = 5603.93125 \, \text{MeV} = 5.60393125 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy
The total energy is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = \gamma E_{\text{rest}} = 3.5714 \times 5.60393125 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Breaking this calculation into parts:

\[
3 \times 5.60393125 = 16.81179375 \, \text{GeV}
\]
\[
0.5714 \times 5.60393125 \approx 3.20224643 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Adding these together:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = 16.81179375 + 3.20224643 \approx 20.01403917 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated total energy is approximately \( 20.014 \, \text{GeV} \). However, none of the options exactly match this value. The closest option is **C) 20.132 GeV**, which is slightly higher. This discrepancy may arise from approximations or assumptions in the problem setup, such as using the sum of individual nucleon masses instead of the precise nuclear mass.

### Conclusion
Based on the calculations and the provided options, the most reasonable answer is:

**Answer: C**
