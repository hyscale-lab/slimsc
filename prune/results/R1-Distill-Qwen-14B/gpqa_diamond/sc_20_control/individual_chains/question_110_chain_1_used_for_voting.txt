Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that both these instruments are high-resolution spectrographs used for various astronomical studies, including exoplanet detection and stellar spectroscopy.

The question gives me five stars, Star1 to Star5, each with different parameters. My task is to figure out which two stars can be observed by both ESPRESSO and HIRES based on their apparent V magnitudes and other factors.

Let me start by recalling the information provided in the question. ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, wait—brighter means lower magnitude, right? Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes mean brighter objects. So stars with V mag ≤17 can be seen by ESPRESSO. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag. So, V mag ≤16 can be observed by HIRES.

So for a star to be detectable by both, its apparent V magnitude must be ≤16, because HIRES has a lower limit (brighter requirement) than ESPRESSO. Because if a star is observable by HIRES (V ≤16), it's also observable by ESPRESSO (since 16 is ≤17). Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. ESPRESSO can see up to 17 mag, which is fainter than HIRES, which can go up to 16. So any star with V mag ≤16 would be detectable by both. But if a star is between 16 and 17, it's only detectable by ESPRESSO, not HIRES. So the key is to find stars with apparent V mag ≤16.

But wait, Star2 has an apparent V mag of 16.5. That's above 16, so HIRES can't detect it. But what about the other stars? Let's look at each one.

Star1: Absolute V is 15.5, distance 10 pc. What's its apparent V mag? Oh wait, absolute magnitude (M) is the apparent magnitude at 10 pc. So since it's at 10 pc, its apparent magnitude is the same as absolute, 15.5. That's less than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it. But what about HIRES? 15.5 is less than 16, so yes, HIRES can see it too. So Star1 would be visible by both.

Wait wait, but Star1's DEC is -75 degrees. I remember that Paranal is in the southern hemisphere (Chile) so it can observe objects with negative declinations. Keck is in Hawaii, which is at about 19 N, so declination 55 degrees (Star2) would be visible, but Star1's DEC is -75, which is far south. But the question says to disregard pointing limits, so I don't need to worry about whether the telescopes can actually observe them. So Star1 is a candidate.

Star2: Apparent V mag is 16.5. That's above 16, so HIRES can't see it. But ESPRESSO can because 16.5 ≤17. So only ESPRESSO can detect it. So Star2 is only visible by ESPRESSO, not both.

Star3: Apparent V mag is 15.5, but wait, there's extinction (E(B-V)=0.6 mag). Oh right, extinction makes stars appear dimmer (higher magnitude). So I need to correct for that. The total absorption in V band is E(B-V) multiplied by 3.1. So 0.6 *3.1=1.86 mag. So the actual apparent magnitude without extinction would be 15.5 minus 1.86? Wait, no. Wait, the extinction adds to the apparent magnitude, because the star looks dimmer. So if the observed apparent magnitude is 15.5, but with extinction, the intrinsic apparent mag would be lower. Wait, no: the formula is V0 = V_observed - A_V. Because A_V is the extinction, which makes the star appear fainter. So V_observed = V0 + A_V. So V0 = V_observed - A_V.

So for Star3: V0 = 15.5 - (0.6 *3.1) = 15.5 -1.86 = 13.64 mag. Wait, that's the corrected apparent magnitude. So without extinction, it's brighter, which would be lower mag. So the actual apparent magnitude (without extinction) is 13.64. But wait, the question says to determine apparent V mag. Or does it mean that Star3's apparent V mag is 15.5, including extinction? Because the question says Star3 has an apparent V mag of 15.5 and E(B-V)=0.6.

Wait, the question says for Star3, "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag". So that 15.5 is after the extinction? Or is that the intrinsic magnitude? Hmm, I think in astronomy, when you measure the apparent magnitude, it's after extinction. So the 15.5 mag is what is observed, but the actual brightness without extinction would be brighter. So without extinction, it's V0 = 15.5 - (0.6 *3.1) = 13.64. But that's the V0, but in terms of observable magnitude, from Earth, it's 15.5. So Star3's apparent mag is 15.5, which is less than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it. But for HIRES, 15.5 is less than 16? No, wait 15.5 is less than 16, so yes, both can observe it.

Wait, 15.5 is less than 16. So yes. So Star3 would be detectable by both.

Wait, but wait: Star3's distance is 15 pc. Oh, but the question gives its apparent magnitude as 15.5. So it's already the observed magnitude. So no need to calculate absolute. So Star3's apparent V mag is 15.5, which is within both's detectable range. So both can see it.

Wait, but wait another point: Star3's E(B-V)=0.6. So the extinction in V is 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86 mag. So the intrinsic magnitude (what it would be without extinction) is 15.5 -1.86 = 13.64. But that's not needed here, because the apparent mag is given as 15.5, which is what's observed. So Star3's apparent mag is 15.5, which is within both spectrographs' limits. So both can detect it. So Star3 is a candidate.

Star4: Absolute V mag is 15.5, located at 10 pc. So apparent mag is same as absolute, 15.5. But it has E(B-V)=0.4. So extinction in V is 0.4 *3.1=1.24 mag. So the apparent magnitude would be M + 5 log10(d/10) + A_V. Wait, but wait: for absolute magnitude M, the apparent magnitude m is calculated as m = M + 5 log (d / 10 pc) + A_V.

Wait, no, I think the formula is m = M + 5 log10 (d) -5 + A_V, where d is in parsecs. Because M is the apparent mag at 10 pc. So for d=10 pc, m = M +0 + A_V.

So for Star4: M=15.5, d=10 pc, so m = 15.5 + (5 log10(10) -5) ) + 1.24? Wait, 5 log10(d/10) is 5*(1-1)=0. So m = M + A_V. So 15.5 + 1.24 =16.74.

Wait, but wait, the extinction (A_V) is added to the apparent magnitude, making it dimmer. So the actual observed apparent magnitude is 16.74. So Star4's apparent mag is 16.74.

So ESPRESSO can observe up to 17 mag, so 16.74 is below 17. So ESPRESSO can see it. But HIRES can only go up to 16 mag. 16.74 is above 16, so HIRES can't detect it. So Star4 can be seen by ESPRESSO but not HIRES.

Wait, but wait: Star4's parameters. Apologies, I think I made a mistake. Because the question states Star4's absolute V magnitude is 15.5, located at 10 pc. So the apparent magnitude without extinction is 15.5. But considering extinction (A_V=1.24), the apparent magnitude becomes 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74. So this would be the observed apparent magnitude. So m=16.74.

So Star4's apparent magnitude is 16.74. So ESPRESSO can see it (16.74 ≤17), but HIRES can't (16.74>16). So Star4 is only detectable by ESPRESSO.

Now, Star5: Absolute V mag is 16.5, located at 5 pc. So the apparent magnitude without extinction would be m = M + 5 log10(d/10) + A_V. Wait, but wait, is there any extinction for Star5? The question says Star5 has absolute V mag 16.5, located at 5 pc. So the apparent mag without extinction would be M + 5 log10(5/10) = 16.5 + 5*(-0.3010) ≈ 16.5 -1.505 =15.0 mag. But wait, the question doesn't mention any extinction for Star5, so E(B-V)=0? So A_V=0. So m = 15.0.

So Star5's apparent V mag is 15.0, which is lower than 16, so both spectrographs can detect it.

Wait, but wait: let me double-check. M is 16.5, d=5 pc. So m = 16.5 +5 log(5) -5 + A_V. Wait, the formula I used earlier was m = M +5 log10(d/10) + A_V. For d=5, d/10=0.5. log(0.5)= -0.3010. So 5 * (-0.3010)= -1.505. So m = M -1.505 + A_V. If A_V is 0, then m=16.5 -1.505 =14.995, which is ~15.0. So yes, apparent mag is 15.0.

So Star5's apparent mag is 15.0, which is below 16, so both can detect it.

So now, let's list which stars are detectable by both:

Star1: apparent mag 15.5 (yes, both can detect).

Star2: 16.5, only ESPRESSO.

Star3: apparent mag 15.5 (without considering extinction, but wait, no, the question says apparent mag is 15.5; but wait, wait, I'm confused. Wait, the problem says Star3's apparent V mag is 15.5 and E(B-V)=0.6. So the 15.5 already includes extinction? Or is that the apparent magnitude before extinction?

Wait, no, I think in astronomy, extinction is part of the observed magnitude. So the apparent magnitude we observe is higher (dimmer) than the intrinsic. So if a star has an extinction of 1.86 mag, its apparent magnitude would be M + distance modulus + 1.86. Wait, no: m = M + 5 log10(d/10) + A_V.

Wait, no, the formula is: m = M + 5 log10 (d/10 pc) + A_V. So A_V is added to the apparent magnitude. So if the star's M is 15.5, but because of extinction, the observed m is higher.

Wait, but in the case of Star3, the question says the apparent V mag is 15.5, and E(B-V)=0.6. So the extinction is 1.86. So that would mean that the actual m without extinction would be m0 = 15.5 - 1.86 =13.64. But the question says the apparent mag is 15.5, so that includes the extinction. So Star3's m is 15.5.

Wait, this is confusing. Let me clarify: when a star's light passes through interstellar medium, it gets dimmed (extinction) and reddened (more red light). The extinction in V band is A_V, which is 3.1 * E(B-V). So E(B-V) is the color excess, which is E(B) - E(V). So for Star3, A_V is 1.86.

So the observed apparent magnitude is m = m0 + A_V, where m0 is the magnitude without extinction. So if the star's true (intrinsic) apparent magnitude is m0, then what we observe is m = m0 + A_V. So in Star3's case, the observed m is 15.5. So m0 = 15.5 -1.86 =13.64. But that's the intrinsic apparent magnitude. But for the purpose of detecting, it's the observed m that matters. Because the instruments are looking at the observed light. So regardless of how bright the star really is, the observed apparent magnitude determines detectability.

So in that case, Star3's observed m is 15.5. So both spectrographs can see it (since 15.5 <16 and <17). So Star3 is detectable by both.

Wait, but wait, Star3's distance is 15 pc. So perhaps I should check its absolute magnitude. But no, the question gives the apparent magnitude, so the distance and absolute mag are already factored in. Because m is given as 15.5. So that's the observed apparent mag, so you don't need to recalculate.

So for each star:

Star1: m=15.5, detectable by both.

Star2: m=16.5, detectable by ESPRESSO only.

Star3: m=15.5, detectable by both.

Star4: m=16.74, detectable by ESPRESSO only.

Star5: m=15.0, detectable by both.

So which stars can be detected by both? Star1, Star3, Star5.

But wait, the options don't include combinations with three stars. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4 is only detected by ESPRESSO, so A is incorrect.

B) Star3 and Star5 → Both can be detected by both, so B is a possible option.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2 only ESPRESSO, Star3 both. So C may not be correct since Star2 can't be detected by HIRES.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star4 only ESPRESSO, so D incorrect.

Wait, but looking back:

Wait, Star1: m=15.5 (apparent). So yes, both can detect.

Star3: m=15.5, both.

Star5: m=15.0, both.

So which options include any two of these? The options don't have 'Star1 and Star3 and Star5'.

Looking at the options:

Option B is Star3 and Star5.

Option D is Star1 and Star4. But Star4 is not detectable by HIRES.

So which of the options have two stars that both can be detected by both?

Looking again:

Star1: yes.

Star3: yes.

Star5: yes.

So the possible correct pairs are any two of Star1, Star3, Star5.

Looking at the options:

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → both are detectable by both. So this is correct.

Option D: Star1 and Star4 → Star4 can't be detected by HIRES.

So the correct option would be any pair where both are detectable by both.

But let me check the options again:

Option A: Star4 and Star5 → Star4 can't be detected by HIRES.

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → both can be detected.

Option C: Star2 and Star3 → Star2 can't be detected by HIRES.

Option D: Star1 and Star4 → Star4 can't.

So the correct answer is option B, which is option B: Star3 and Star5.

Wait, but wait another point. The question is about being detected by both spectrographs. So Star1 is detectable by both, but I don't see it in any option except option D, which pairs it with Star4, which is not correct.

Wait, the options given are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → only Star5 can be detected by both.

B) Star3 and Star5 → both can be detected.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2 can't.

D) Star1 and Star4 → only Star1 can.

So the correct pair is Star3 and Star5, which is option B.

Wait, but wait another thing. For Star5, is the apparent magnitude 15.0 correct? Because M=16.5, d=5 pc.

So m = M +5 log10(5/10) + A_V.

Wait, A_V is 0, since Star5 doesn't have E(B-V) mentioned. So m = 16.5 + 5*(log(0.5)) → log(0.5) is about -0.3010.

So 5 * (-0.3010) = -1.505.

So m = 16.5 - 1.505 =14.995, approximately 15.0.

So yes, correct. So Star5's app mag is 15.0, which is within both instruments.

So the stars detectable by both are Star1, Star3, Star5.

Looking at the options, the only pair that's included is Star3 and Star5 (option B).

Wait, but what about Star1? It's also detectable by both. So why isn't it part of any option?

Looking at the options again:

Option D is Star1 and Star4. But Star4's apparent mag is 16.74, which is too faint for HIRES. So option D is wrong.

Option B is Star3 and Star5, both are detectable by both.

So the correct answer should be option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars, considering the detection limits of the instruments. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes ≤17, while HIRES can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes ≤16. Therefore, a star must have an apparent V magnitude ≤16 to be detectable by both instruments.

### Analysis of Each Star:

1. **Star1**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude: 15.5  
   - Distance: 10 pc  
   - Apparent V magnitude: Same as absolute magnitude since it is at 10 pc, so \( m = 15.5 \).  
   - Detectable by both ESPRESSO (\( 15.5 \leq 17 \)) and HIRES (\( 15.5 \leq 16 \)).  

2. **Star2**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude: 16.5  
   - Detectable by ESPRESSO (\( 16.5 \leq 17 \)) but not by HIRES (\( 16.5 > 16 \)).  

3. **Star3**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude: 15.5  
   - E(B-V) = 0.6, so extinction in V band: \( A_V = 3.1 \times 0.6 = 1.86 \).  
   - The apparent magnitude already includes extinction, so \( m = 15.5 \).  
   - Detectable by both ESPRESSO (\( 15.5 \leq 17 \)) and HIRES (\( 15.5 \leq 16 \)).  

4. **Star4**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude: 15.5  
   - Distance: 10 pc  
   - Apparent V magnitude without extinction: \( m = 15.5 \).  
   - E(B-V) = 0.4, so extinction in V band: \( A_V = 3.1 \times 0.4 = 1.24 \).  
   - Observed apparent magnitude: \( m = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74 \).  
   - Detectable by ESPRESSO (\( 16.74 \leq 17 \)) but not by HIRES (\( 16.74 > 16 \)).  

5. **Star5**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude: 16.5  
   - Distance: 5 pc  
   - Apparent V magnitude: \( m = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(5/10) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 15.0 \).  
   - No extinction mentioned, so \( A_V = 0 \).  
   - Detectable by both ESPRESSO (\( 15.0 \leq 17 \)) and HIRES (\( 15.0 \leq 16 \)).  

### Conclusion:
The stars detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES are **Star1, Star3, and Star5**. Among the given options, the pair **Star3 and Star5** is the correct choice.

**Answer: B**
