Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, it's about selecting the right reagents for two reactions.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and another reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, what's butan-2-one? Oh right, that's methylacetone, right? Its structure is (CH3)2CO. So, reacting that with NaCN. I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition. NaCN is a source of CN- ions, which are nucleophiles. So, the CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon.

But wait, where does the hydroxyl group come from? Oh, maybe after the nucleophilic addition, there's a work-up step. Oh wait, if you add a nucleophile to a ketone, you get a cyanohydrin. So, the product would have a hydroxyl group and a nitrile group attached to the same carbon as the former carbonyl. So the structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Which matches the product given: 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Because butanenitrile would have four carbons, but here the middle carbons are CH2 and CH(CH3), so maybe I got that right.

Wait, so the process is: ketone + CN^- → cyanohydrin. But how is this achieved? I think the reaction involves first adding the cyanide ion to the carbonyl, forming a tetrahedral intermediate, and then maybe acid work-up? Because sometimes you need acid to protonate and then eliminate, but wait for cyanohydrin formation, is it done under acidic conditions? Or maybe it's done in a basic solution, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, but looking at the reagents, NaCN is used with reagent A. So, A must be providing the acidic conditions. Or maybe it's H3O+ as a catalyst. Because sometimes in such additions, you need acid to generate the nucleophilic CN-.

Alternatively, could it be that the reaction is using NaHSO3 as the reagent? Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite, which is used in the oxymercuration reaction, but that's for alkenes. Hmm. Or maybe for some other addition reactions. Wait, but in the cyanohydrin formation, I think the conditions are typically basic or neutral, but sometimes acid is used.

Wait, but let me recall. The formation of a cyanohydrin is usually done by adding KCN under basic conditions, but sometimes in the presence of an acid catalyst. Oh wait, I'm a bit confused. Another approach: think about the second reaction, maybe that will help.

The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (and H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So, the nitrile group is being oxidized to a carboxylic acid. How do you oxidize nitriles? Well, the typical reagents for oxidizing nitriles to carboxylic acids are strong oxidizing agents like KMnO4 under acidic conditions, or perhaps using something like HNO3 with H2SO4 as a catalyst. Alternatively, under certain conditions with H2O, maybe using a catalyst like H2SO4 or another acid.

Wait, but in the problem, the second reagent is B, and H2O is also present. So, the nitrile (CH2CN) group is being turned into a COOH group. So, the nitrile → acid.

So, possible reagents for that could be KMnO4 under acidic conditions. Or maybe another oxidizing agent like HClO in HCl. Wait, but what's more common? KMnO4 in acidic conditions is a strong oxidizer. So if the reaction is with B and H2O, perhaps B is an acid like HCl. Because KMnO4 in HCl would be a possible scenario. Or maybe H2SO4 as the acid.

Wait, the options for B are either HCl or CH3COOH. Looking at the options: option A has B as HCl, option B as CH3COOH. So, if the second reaction is oxidation of nitrile to acid, perhaps HCl is the acid used with KMnO4? Or wait, but the presence of H2O suggests it's a hydrolysis. Wait, but nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions to form carboxylic acids or amines, depending on the conditions. But in this case, the product is a carboxylic acid, so it's hydrolysis under acidic conditions.

Wait, hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids typically involves either strong acidic or basic conditions. In acidic conditions, you can use H2O and a strong acid like HCl. So, maybe reagent B is HCl.

So, going back to the first reaction. The first step is the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone. The cyanohydrin formation requires the addition of CN- to the carbonyl group. The typical method is to use KCN or NaCN in a slightly acidic or neutral solution. Wait, but sometimes you might need a proton source because the addition of CN- can be slow without some acid catalysis.

Wait, but in the presence of NaCN, perhaps the solution is slightly basic. So, if you add an acid (like H3O+), it would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic, and then the CN- can attack. So reagent A could be H3O+.

Looking at the options, option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl. Option D is A=NaHSO3, B=HCl.

Wait, but what's NaHSO3 used for? Sodium bisulfite is used in reactions like the oxymercuration or maybe in the formation of sulfites. Wait, in the case of ketones, could NaHSO3 act as a catalyst? I'm not sure. I think that for the cyanohydrin formation, using H3O+ (which would provide H+ ions) would help in the nucleophilic attack by CN-.

So, putting it together: the first reaction uses NaCN and H3O+ as reagent A. So, option A or B. Because the options for A are either H3O+ or NaHSO3.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes, when dealing with ketones and NaCN, the reaction is done in a basic solution, without needing acid. But maybe in this case, the reaction requires some acid to form the cyanohydrin. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is done without acid, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the product. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which is the cyanohydrin. So, the reaction is butan-2-one + NaCN → cyanohydrin. Do I need an acid catalyst for that?

I think that the reaction of ketones with KCN typically uses a base, like aqueous NaOH, but sometimes, especially for less reactive carbonyl groups, an acid might be used. Wait, no, acid catalysis is more for reactions where the nucleophile is a weak one. Wait, but in the presence of NaCN, which is a source of CN-.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is done in a solution that's slightly basic. Then, why would H3O+ be used? Alternatively, maybe the reaction is done without any additional acid, but in the given options, the reagent A could be something else.

Wait, looking at the options, option D has A as NaHSO3. What's that used for? Maybe as a source of HSO3- which can act as a nucleophile? Or perhaps as a mild oxidizing agent.

Alternatively, maybe the first reaction is a substitution. But I don't think so. It's more likely an addition reaction.

Wait, but another possibility: maybe the first step is a substitution of the ketone group. No, that doesn't make sense because ketones aren't typically substituted; they undergo addition or other reactions.

So, getting back, the first reagent, A, must be providing the acidic conditions for the nucleophilic addition of CN- to the ketone. So, H3O+ is a possible candidate. So, option A or B.

Now, looking at the options, option A's B is HCl, and option B's B is CH3COOH. For the second reaction, which is the oxidation of nitrile to carboxylic acid, HCl would be a possible acid. So, using HCl (option A's B) would fit.

So, putting it together: A is H3O+, B is HCl. That would make options A and B. Wait, let's check. The first reaction uses A as H3O+, second uses B as HCl.

Wait, but in the first reaction, H3O+ would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic, allowing CN- to attack. Then, perhaps after the addition, the solution is acidified, but in this case, the reagent is H3O+.

So, so far, the first reagent A is H3O+.

Now, the second reaction is the nitrile to carboxylic acid. So, the reagent B is HCl, making the solution acidic and allowing the nitrile to hydrolyze to the acid.

Wait, but wait, in the presence of H2O, it's a hydrolysis. So, the reaction would be: RCN + H2O → RCOOH under acidic conditions. So, the reagent B must be an acid. So, HCl would provide the H+ ions.

So, looking at the options, option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl. That fits.

But let me make sure about the first reaction. Could A be NaHSO3 instead of H3O+? What's NaHSO3 used for? I'm trying to remember. Oh wait, perhaps in the presence of a weaker acid, the bisulfite could act as a catalyst. Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe the first reaction doesn't need any additional reagent beyond NaCN, but in the options, reagent A is provided, so maybe that's the case.

Alternatively, maybe the first reaction uses a different mechanism. Wait, but I'm pretty confident that for cyanohydrin formation, the CN- attacks the carbonyl, which might be facilitated by acid.

So, I think the correct reagents are A=H3O+ and B=HCl, which is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one (a ketone) and NaCN. Cyanohydrin formation typically requires the nucleophilic attack of CN⁻ on the carbonyl carbon of the ketone. To facilitate this reaction, acidic conditions are often used, as the protonation of the carbonyl oxygen increases its electrophilicity. Among the options, H₃O⁺ (option A) provides the necessary acidic environment, making it suitable as reagent A.

The second reaction involves the oxidation of a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. This is achieved through hydrolysis under acidic conditions. HCl (option A) is a strong acid that can provide the required acidic environment for the hydrolysis of the nitrile group to form the carboxylic acid. Therefore, HCl is the appropriate choice for reagent B.

Considering the options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl. This combination aligns with the requirements for both reactions.
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH. While H₃O⁺ is correct for the first reaction, CH₃COOH is not strong enough to effectively hydrolyze the nitrile group in the second reaction.
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl. NaHSO₃ is not typically used for cyanohydrin formation, making this option incorrect.
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH. Neither NaHSO₃ nor CH₃COOH is suitable for the given reactions.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**, where A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.
