Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

We've got a bunch of identical systems—10,000 of them. Each system has a particle that's moving along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function for each particle is given as (a divided by the square root of (1 + x)) minus 0.5i. Oh wait, and i is the square root of -1, so that's the imaginary unit.

The key thing is that when they measure the position of the particles, none are found outside the region between x=1 and x=3. So all the particles are confined to x between 1 and 3. The question is asking for the value of 'a'.

Hmm, okay. So this is a problem about wave functions and normalization, I think. Because in quantum mechanics, the wave function must be normalized so that the total probability of finding the particle somewhere is 1. And since the particles aren't found outside x=1 to x=3, that must mean the wave function is zero outside that region. Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Wait, the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. But wait, if the wave function is zero outside a region, that's a boundary condition, but here the wave function isn't zero. Hmm.

Wait, wait. Oh, wait, the problem says that when measuring, none were found at x<1 and x>3. So the probability of finding the particle outside [1,3] is zero. That suggests that the wave function must be zero outside this region. But the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, that seems to be a complex function. So perhaps the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. But wait, the given expression is for the part where it can exist. So maybe inside the region the wave function is as given, and outside it's zero. Or perhaps the wave function is given only for the allowed region, and elsewhere it's zero.

Wait, the question says, "the wave function of each particle, in a part of space where it can exist, can be described as..." So perhaps the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i for x between 1 and 3, and zero elsewhere. But when you square the absolute value, you get the probability density. So the integral of the probability density from x=1 to x=3 should equal 1, because the total probability is 1.

Wait, but our wave function is complex. So, the probability density is the square of the absolute value of the wave function. So for any wave function ψ(x), the probability is |ψ(x)|².

So let's compute |ψ(x)|². The given ψ is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So let's compute the absolute value squared.

The absolute value squared is (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)², because the real part is (a/sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5. So when you square the absolute value, you square both real and imaginary parts and add them.

So |ψ(x)|² = [ (a²)/(1+x) ) ] + (0.5)^2.

Which is a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

But wait, this would be the case only between x=1 and x=3. Because outside that region, the wave function is zero, so the probability is zero there.

So to find the normalization constant 'a', we need to integrate the probability density from x=1 to x=3 and set it equal to 1.

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [ a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Wait, but wait a second. If the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, then the probability density is |ψ(x)|². So that's (a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ). So the integral of this from 1 to 3 must be 1.

So, let's compute this integral.

Breaking it down, the integral is:

Integral from 1 to 3 [ a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = a² * Integral (1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to 3 + Integral 0.25 dx from 1 to 3.

Compute each part:

First integral: Integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). Evaluated from 1 to 3:

ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So the first term is a² * ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25 times (3 -1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So total integral is a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So the equation is a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Subtract 0.5 from both sides: a² ln(2) = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute that numerically. Let's calculate ln(2): approximately 0.6931.

So a² = 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Taking square root: a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options:

A) 1.1 → 1.1 squared is 1.21. No, because a² would be about 0.72.

B) 0.85 → 0.85^2 is 0.7225. That's very close to 0.7213.

C) 0.35 → 0.1225. No.

D) 0.6 → 0.36. No.

So option B is 0.85, which is the closest. Wait, wait, let me double-check my calculations.

Let me compute 0.5 / ln(2). ln(2) is approximately 0.69314718056.

0.5 divided by 0.69314718056 = 0.5 / 0.693147 ≈ 0.72134752044.

So a² = 0.72134752044.

Then a is sqrt(0.72134752044) ≈ 0.849, which is about 0.849. The options have 0.85 as option B, and 0.6 as D.

So the answer should be B) 0.85.

Wait, but wait another thing. The wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the probability density is |ψ|² = (a²/(1+x)) + (0.5)^2. But in quantum mechanics, the wave function must be normalized, meaning the integral of |ψ|² over all space is 1. But in this problem, the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. So our calculation is correct.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes, the wave function is given as a real function, but here it's complex. So could that affect anything? No, because the normalization is based on |ψ|² regardless of whether ψ is real or complex.

So yes, the calculations seem correct.

To determine the value of \( a \), we start by normalizing the given wave function \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \). The probability density is given by \( |\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25 \). Since the wave function is zero outside \( x \in [1, 3] \), the normalization condition requires:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1.
\]

Substituting \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

Breaking this into two parts:

1. \( \int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx = a^2 \ln(1+x) \Big|_{1}^{3} = a^2 \ln(4) - a^2 \ln(2) = a^2 \ln(2). \)
2. \( \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5. \)

Adding these results:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849.
\]

Comparing this result with the options:

- \( A) 1.1 \): \( 1.1^2 = 1.21 \), too large.
- \( B) 0.85 \): \( 0.85^2 = 0.7225 \), very close to \( 0.7213 \).
- \( C) 0.35 \): \( 0.35^2 = 0.1225 \), too small.
- \( D) 0.6 \): \( 0.6^2 = 0.36 \), too small.

Thus, the closest value is \( B) 0.85 \).

So, let's compute this integral.

Breaking it down, the integral is:

Integral from 1 to 3 [ a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = a² * Integral (1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to 3 + Integral 0.25 dx from 1 to 3.

Compute each part:

First integral: Integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). Evaluated from 1 to 3:

ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So the first term is a² * ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25 times (3 -1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So total integral is a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So the equation is a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Subtract 0.5 from both sides: a² ln(2) = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute that numerically. Let's calculate ln(2): approximately 0.6931.

So a² = 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Taking square root: a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options:

A) 1.1 → 1.1 squared is 1.21. No, because a² would be about 0.72.

B) 0.85 → 0.85^2 is 0.7225. That's very close to 0.7213.

C) 0.35 → 0.1225. No.

D) 0.6 → 0.36. No.

So option B is 0.85, which is the closest. Wait, wait, let me double-check my calculations.

Let me compute 0.5 / ln(2). ln(2) is approximately 0.69314718056.

0.5 divided by 0.69314718056 = 0.5 / 0.693147 ≈ 0.72134752044.

So a² = 0.72134752044.

Then a is sqrt(0.72134752044) ≈ 0.849, which is about 0.849. The options have 0.85 as option B, and 0.6 as D.

So the answer should be B) 0.85.

The probability density is given by \( |\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25 \). Since the wave function is zero outside \( x \in [1, 3] \), the normalization condition requires:

\[

\]

Substituting \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), the integral becomes:

\[

\]

Breaking this into two parts:

1. \( \int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx = a^2 \ln(1+x) \Big|_{1}^{3} = a^2 \ln(4) - a^2 \ln(2) = a^2 \ln(2). \)
2. \( \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5. \)

Adding these results:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849.
