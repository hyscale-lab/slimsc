Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem says we dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The Ka of acetic acid is given as 1.85x10^-5. The options are A to D.

Hmm, okay. I remember that when you dilute a weak acid, its concentration decreases, which affects the pH. Then, during titration, the pH changes based on how much base has been added.

First, let's tackle the initial dilution. We have 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So, the new concentration of acetic acid can be calculated using the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2.

So M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2. Plugging the numbers: 0.05 M * 20 cm³ / 40 cm³ = 0.025 M. So the concentration becomes 0.025 M.

Wait, no. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Oh no, wait. Because when you dilute a solution, the amount of solute stays the same. So initial moles of acetic acid: Molarity is moles per liter. So 0.05 M is 0.05 moles per liter. Volume is 20 cm³, which is 0.02 liters. So moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles.

After adding 20 cm³ of water, total volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So new concentration is moles / volume: 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yes, that's correct. So the diluted acetic acid has a concentration of 0.025 M.

Now, when we titrate this with NaOH. NaOH is a strong base, so it will react completely with the acetic acid. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O.

So first, let's find the equivalence point. At equivalence, moles of NaOH added equal moles of acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.001 moles (from earlier). So moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is also 0.001 moles.

NaOH concentration is 0.1 M. Volume needed (V) is moles / concentration: 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 liters, which is 10 cm³.

So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH has been added. But the question is about 25% titration. 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

Wait, that's one way to think about it. Alternatively, 25% of the acid has been neutralized, so 25% of the moles have reacted. So moles of NaOH added at 25% is 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles.

Wait, that's correct regardless of the equivalence volume. So at 25% titration, the moles of NaOH added are 0.25 times the initial moles of acetic acid. So 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles.

Now, let's think about the pH at 25% titration. At this point, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming acetate ions. So the solution will have a buffer of acetic acid and its conjugate base, acetate.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]). So we can use that.

Wait, but first, we need to find the concentrations of HA and A- after the reaction.

The initial moles of acetic acid is 0.001. At 25% titration, 0.00025 moles of it have been neutralized by NaOH. So moles of HA (acetic acid) remaining = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles.

Moles of A- (acetate) formed: equal to the moles of NaOH added, which is 0.00025 moles.

Now, the total volume after adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. The initial solution was 40 cm³ (from 20+20), plus 2.5 cm³, so 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = ? Let me calculate that. 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

[A-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

pKa is -log(Ka). Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa is about 4.735 (since log(1.85)=0.267, so 5 -0.267=4.733, approximately 4.73).

So pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]). Plugging in the values:

log(0.005882 / 0.017647) = log(0.3333) ≈ -0.477.

So pH = 4.73 + (-0.477) ≈ 4.253. So approximately 4.25.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Moles HA: 0.00075, A-: 0.00025. Volume 42.5 mL.

[HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

[A-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M.

Ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

So log(1/3) is approximately -0.477. Thus, pH = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253. So about 4.25.

Looking at the options, the first value in option A is 4.26, which is close. But let's hold on a second. Maybe I made a slight miscalculation.

Wait, another approach: exact calculation with more precise numbers.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa = log(1/1.85e-5) → wait, no, pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that accurately.

Ka = 1.85e-5.

log(1.85) is approximately 0.2672. So pKa = 4.7328.

So pKa ≈ 4.73.

Now, the ratio [A-]/[HA] is 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3. So log(1/3) = -0.4771.

So pH = 4.7328 - 0.4771 = 4.2557, so approximately 4.256. So about 4.26. So the first part of the answer is about 4.26.

Now, the second part is the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming acetate ions. So the solution will be a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so the solution will be basic.

The acetate ion (A-) will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be calculated using Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C.

So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = approximately 5.405e-10.

Wait, let me compute that: 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405e-9 = 5.405e-10.

The concentration of acetate at equivalence point: Let's calculate the moles. We had 0.001 moles of acetic acid, which all converted to acetate. So moles of acetate is 0.001.

The total volume at equivalence point: initial solution (40 cm³) plus volume of NaOH added (10 cm³) → 50 cm³ = 0.05 L.

So concentration of acetate: 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Now, to find the pH, we can set up the expression for Kb.

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the concentration of OH^- produced.

Kb is 5.405e-10 = x² / (0.02 - x). Since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So x² = Kb * 0.02 → x² = (5.405e-10)(0.02) = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.

Wait, that's about 9.02. But none of the options have a pH near 9. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, wait. Did I make a mistake in the moles or volume?

Wait, let's go back. At equivalence point, moles of NaOH added is 0.001 moles (same as initial moles of acetic acid). The total volume is 40 +10 =50 cm³ (0.05 L). So [A-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. That's correct.

Kb is 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = 5.405e-10. Correct.

The equation is Kb = x² / 0.02 → x = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) = approx 1.04e-5. So [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) → log(1e-5)=5, log(1.04)=0.017. So about 4.983. So pH is 14 -4.983=9.017.

Wait, but the options don't have anything near 9. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) 4.26; 8.52

B) 3.17;6.73 

C)4.73;7.00 

D)4.57;6.92

Hmm, my calculation for equivalence point is about 9.02, but none of the options have that. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, wait. Let me think again about the equivalence point. Wait, wait a second. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and when neutralized by strong base, the solution is a solution of the conjugate base, which is acetate, as I had. But maybe I made a mistake in the Kb calculation or the concentrations.

Wait, another approach: Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the hydrolysis of acetate in a more precise way.

The hydrolysis reaction: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb is Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) → let me compute that accurately.

1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 → 0.5405e-9 = 5.405e-10.

Correct. So Kb is indeed 5.405e-10.

Concentration of acetate is 0.02 M.

So, Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] = x²/(0.02 - x) ≈ x²/0.02.

x² = Kb * 0.02 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

So [OH^-] = 1.04e-5 → pOH = 4.98 → pH = 9.02. So around 9.02.

But the options don't have anything near that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps.

Wait, let me think again. Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the equivalence point.

Wait, another way: perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles. Let me recheck.

Initial moles of acetic acid: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. That's correct.

Equivalence point: 0.001 moles of NaOH added. Volume of NaOH is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. Correct.

Total volume at equivalence point: 40 +10=50 cm³=0.05 L. Correct.

Concentration of acetate: 0.001/0.05 = 0.02 M. Correct.

Wait, but perhaps I forgot that the solution is acetate in water, but maybe the solution is more diluted than I thought. No, the calculation seems right.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation.

Wait, wait, but wait. Another approach: perhaps the problem uses the same concentration for the equivalence point but I made a mistake in the way I calculated the Kb or the pH.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is a buffer at the equivalence point? No, no. At equivalence, the acid is neutralized to its conjugate base, so it's a solution of the conjugate base, which is a weak base. So the pH should be above 7. But according to the options, the highest pH listed is 8.52 in option A, 7 in C, 6.92 in D. So none of the options match my current calculation of ~9.02.

Hmm, that suggests I must have made a mistake somewhere. Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the volume. Let me check.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait. When you add 0.1 M NaOH to the acetic acid solution, the initial volume of the diluted acetic acid is 40 cm³, and I'm adding 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH to reach equivalence.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M and 40 cm³. When I add 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH, the total volume is 50 cm³. So the acetate concentration is 0.001 moles in 0.05 L, which is 0.02 M. Correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the acetate ion's hydrolysis is more accurately represented by a different approach. Let me try using the exact expression.

The hydrolysis equation: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Let me denote [OH^-] as x.

At equilibrium, [CH3COO^-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02, since x is very small.

So, Kb = x^2 / (0.02) = 5.405e-10 → x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x= sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

So [OH^-] = 1.04e-5 → pOH = log(1.04e-5) → log(1.04) ≈ 0.017, so 4.983 → pH = 14 -4.983=9.017.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial dilution calculation. Let me recheck.

Initial solution: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. So moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles.

After adding 20 cm³ of water, the volume is 40 cm³. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. That's correct.

Wait, unless I miscalculated the equivalence point. Wait, another possibility: Maybe the NaOH is not 0.1 M but a different concentration? No, the problem states 0.1 M NaOH.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the equivalence point calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I should account for activity coefficients or something, but I think that's beyond the scope here.

Wait, perhaps the problem asks for the pH when 25% of the solution is titrated, not 25% of the equivalence volume. Oh, wait, the question says "at 25% titration". So perhaps that means 25% of the equivalence volume added. Or does it mean 25% of the acid has been neutralized, which would be the same. Because the equivalence volume is 10 cm³, 25% is 2.5 cm³. So that part is correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Let me recalculate that part.

At 25% titration, moles of NaOH added = 0.00025.

Moles of HA remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075.

Moles of A- formed: 0.00025.

Total volume is 40 +2.5 =42.5 cm³=0.0425 L.

So [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

[A-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

So ratio [A-]/[HA] = 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa + log(0.3333) → pKa is 4.73.

Log(1/3) is -0.477, so pH = 4.73 -0.477 =4.253. So about 4.25.

Looking at the options, option A's first value is 4.26, which is very close. So perhaps option A is the correct one, but then what about the equivalence point?

Wait, but earlier I got a pH of about 9.02 at equivalence, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial moles. Let me recheck.

Wait, no. 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. Correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the acetic acid solution is diluted to 40 cm³, but when you add 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, the total volume is 42.5 cm³, not 40. Then, at equivalence, the volume is 50 cm³, correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that when the solution is diluted with water, some of the acetic acid might not dissociate as much, but I don't think that affects the calculation at the 25% titration point.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the equivalence point. Let me try using the exact expression without approximation.

So, Kb = 5.405e-10. The initial concentration is 0.02 M, and the change is x.

At equilibrium: [CH3COO^-] = 0.02 - x.

[CH3COOH] = x.

[OH^-] = x.

So Kb = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) = x²/(0.02 -x) = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is negligible compared to 0.02, so x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 =1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈1.04e-5. So same as before.

But maybe the assumption isn't valid. Let's check the approximation: 1.04e-5 is 0.0000104. 0.02 is 0.02, so x is about 0.05% of 0.02, which is acceptable. So the approximation holds.

So my initial calculation of pH 9.02 is correct. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm supposed to calculate the pH at the equivalence point using a different approach, like considering the hydrolysis of the salt. Wait, no, that's what I did.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the acetate concentration. Wait, moles of acetate at equivalence point is 0.001, volume is 50 cm³, so 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. Correct.

Hmm, perhaps I missed a step in the problem. Let me reread the problem.

The problem says we dilute 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ water, then titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH. So the initial acetic acid concentration after dilution is 0.025 M, as I calculated.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the mistake is that I forgot to consider that some of the NaOH solution would change the volume of the solution when added. Wait, but that's already accounted for in the calculations.

Wait, maybe the problem uses a different approach for the equivalence point. Let me try calculating the pH again.

Wait, another approach: The pH at equivalence point can also be found using the formula for a solution of a salt of a weak acid and strong base.

The formula is pH = ½ (pKa + pKw). Because at equivalence, the concentration of acetate is equal to the concentration of its conjugate acid (but wait, that's not exactly right).

Wait, wait. For a weak acid (HA) and strong base (NaOH), the equivalence point solution is a solution of NaA, where A- is the conjugate base. The pH depends on the Kb of A-.

Alternatively, the solution can be considered as a buffer at half equivalence, but not at equivalence.

Wait, wait, another approach: The pH at equivalence point can be calculated using the hydrolysis of the conjugate base. Which is what I did earlier.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating Kb. Let me recalculate Kb.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa = about 4.73.

Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) → 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 = approx 0.5405e-9 =5.405e-10. Correct.

So, the Kb is correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the initial assumption of the equivalence point. Let me think again.

Wait, another thought: Maybe I should calculate the pH at the equivalence point using the concentration of acetate and the Kb, but perhaps the solution is more dilute, so the approximation may not hold. Let me try without the approximation.

The equation is x² = Kb (0.02 -x).

So x² =5.405e-10 (0.02 -x).

Assuming x is small, let me try plugging in x=1e-5.

x=1e-5 → x²=1e-10. 5.405e-10 * (0.02 -1e-5)=5.405e-10 * 0.01999 ≈ 1.079e-11.

x²=1e-10, which is larger than 1.079e-11, so x would be a bit less than 1e-5.

Wait, but that doesn't change the result much. So perhaps the approximation holds.

Hmm, I'm stuck. According to my calculations, the pH at equivalence is about 9.02, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial problem setup.

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps I miscalculated the initial diluted concentration of acetic acid.

Wait, initial volume after dilution: 20 +20=40 cm³. Moles of acetic acid: 0.05 M * 0.02 L =0.001 moles. So concentration is 0.001/0.04 = 0.025 M. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the concentration after dilution is 0.025 M, but when titrated, the NaOH is in excess, but no, at equivalence, it's exactly neutral.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the pH at equivalence point. Let me try using the exact quadratic equation.

x² = Kb * (0.02 -x) → x² + Kb x - 2 Kb =0.

Wait, that's x² + (5.405e-10)x - (2 *5.405e-10*0.02) =0 → x² +5.405e-10 x - 2.162e-11=0.

Using quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a).

Here, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -2.162e-11.

Discriminant D = b² +4ac = (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*2.162e-11.

Calculate each term:

(5.405e-10)^2 = 2.9214e-19.

4 *1 *2.162e-11 =8.648e-11.

So D = 2.9214e-19 +8.648e-11. Since 8.648e-11 is much larger than 2.92e-19, D approx 8.648e-11.

sqrt(D)=sqrt(8.648e-11)= approx 9.3e-6.

So x = [ -5.405e-10 ±9.3e-6 ]/(2).

We take the positive root: ( -5.405e-10 +9.3e-6 )/2 ≈ (9.2946e-6)/2 ≈4.647e-6.

Wait, that's a different value. So x=4.647e-6.

[OH^-]=4.647e-6 → pOH=5.33 → pH=8.67.

Ah! Wait, that's different. So I must have made a mistake earlier. So the pH at equivalence is around 8.67, not 9.02.

Wait, why did this happen? Because when I neglected the x in the denominator, I assumed x was negligible, but in reality, x is about 4.6e-6, which is 0.023% of 0.02, which is very small, but perhaps the previous approximation was slightly off.

Wait, wait, let me recalculate using the exact quadratic solution.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic equation setup.

The correct equation is x² = Kb*(0.02 -x) → x² + Kb x - (0.02 Kb) =0.

So a=1, b=Kb, c= -0.02 Kb.

So the quadratic equation is x² + (5.405e-10)x - (0.02 *5.405e-10)=0 → x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11 =0.

So discriminant D = (5.405e-10)^2 +4 *1 *1.081e-11.

Compute each term:

(5.405e-10)^2 = 2.921e-19.

4 *1 *1.081e-11=4.324e-11.

So D=2.921e-19 +4.324e-11 ≈4.324e-11.

sqrt(D)=sqrt(4.324e-11)= approx 6.576e-6.

So x = [ -5.405e-10 ±6.576e-6 ]/(2 *1).

Taking positive root: (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 ≈6.576e-6/2=3.288e-6.

So x≈3.288e-6.

Wait, that's about 3.29e-6. Then [OH^-]=3.29e-6 → pOH=5.486 → pH=14-5.486=8.514.

Ah, that's around 8.51, which matches option A's equivalence pH of 8.52.

Wait, so I must have made a mistake earlier when I set up the quadratic equation. Let me redo the setup.

The correct equation is x² = Kb*(0.02 -x). So x² + Kb x - (0.02 Kb) =0.

Wait, that's correct. Let me compute the discriminant again accurately.

Kb=5.405e-10, c= -0.02 *5.405e-10= -1.081e-11.

So D= (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*1.081e-11 = (2.921e-19) + (4.324e-11) =4.324e-11 +2.921e-19 ≈4.324e-11.

sqrt(4.324e-11) = about 6.576e-6.

So x=( -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 )/2 → (6.5706e-6)/2=3.285e-6.

So [OH^-]=3.285e-6 → pOH=5.487 → pH=8.513. Rounded to two decimal places, 8.51. Close to option A's 8.52.

So the pH at equivalence is about 8.51, which is close to option A's 8.52.

Now, the pH at 25% titration was calculated to be about 4.25, which is close to option A's 4.26.

So the correct option would be A) 4.26; 8.52.

Wait, but earlier when I used the approximation, I got pH=9.02, but when I considered the quadratic, I got pH=8.51. So that must have been the mistake. I should have used the quadratic approach without approximation.

So the pH at equivalence point is approximately 8.51, which matches option A.

So the correct answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Initially, 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid contains:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
\]

After dilution with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration is:

\[
\text{Concentration of acetic acid} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{moles}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### At 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the moles of acetic acid have reacted with NaOH. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH added} = 0.25 \times 0.001 = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The remaining moles of acetic acid (HA) are:

\[
\text{Moles of HA} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The moles of acetate ion (A⁻) formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of A⁻} = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The total volume after adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm³} + 2.5 \, \text{cm³} = 42.50 \, \text{cm³} = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of HA and A⁻ are:

\[
[\text{HA}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} = 0.017647 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{A⁻}] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} = 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{A⁻}]}{[\text{HA}]} \right),
\]

where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73\). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log \left( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \right) = 4.73 + \log(0.3333) \approx 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.

---

### At the Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming 0.001 moles of acetate ion (A⁻). The total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm³} + 10.00 \, \text{cm³} = 50.00 \, \text{cm³} = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ion is:

\[
[\text{A⁻}] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH₃COO⁻} + \text{H₂O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH₃COOH} + \text{OH⁻}.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Let \([\text{OH⁻}] = x\). At equilibrium:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{A⁻} - x]}.
\]

Since \(K_b\) is very small, \(x \ll 0.02\), so:

\[
K_b \approx \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot 0.02 = (5.405 \times 10^{-10})(0.02) = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}, \quad x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

\([\text{OH⁻}] = 1.04 \times 10^{-5}\), so:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.98, \quad \text{pH} = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.
\]

However, this result does not match the options. Revisiting the calculation using the quadratic equation:

\[
x^2 + K_b x - (K_b \cdot 0.02) = 0.
\]

Substituting \(K_b = 5.405 \times 10^{-10}\):

\[
x^2 + (5.405 \times 10^{-10})x - (1.081 \times 10^{-11}) = 0.
\]

Solving this quadratic equation gives:

\[
x \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6}.
\]

\([\text{OH⁻}] = 3.29 \times 10^{-6}\), so:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.29 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.48, \quad \text{pH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.
\]

Thus, the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**.

---

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**. These values match option **A**.

**Answer: A**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem says we dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The Ka of acetic acid is given as 1.85x10^-5. The options are A to D.

Hmm, okay. I remember that when you dilute a weak acid, its concentration decreases, which affects the pH. Then, during titration, the pH changes based on how much base has been added.

First, let's tackle the initial dilution. We have 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So, the new concentration of acetic acid can be calculated using the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2.

So M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2. Plugging the numbers: 0.05 M * 20 cm³ / 40 cm³ = 0.025 M. So the concentration becomes 0.025 M.

Wait, no. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Oh no, wait. Because when you dilute a solution, the amount of solute stays the same. So initial moles of acetic acid: Molarity is moles per liter. So 0.05 M is 0.05 moles per liter. Volume is 20 cm³, which is 0.02 liters. So moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles.

After adding 20 cm³ of water, total volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So new concentration is moles / volume: 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yes, that's correct. So the diluted acetic acid has a concentration of 0.025 M.

Now, when we titrate this with NaOH. NaOH is a strong base, so it will react completely with the acetic acid. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O.

So first, let's find the equivalence point. At equivalence, moles of NaOH added equal moles of acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.001 moles (from earlier). So moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is also 0.001 moles.

NaOH concentration is 0.1 M. Volume needed (V) is moles / concentration: 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 liters, which is 10 cm³.

So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH has been added. But the question is about 25% titration. 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

Wait, that's one way to think about it. Alternatively, 25% of the acid has been neutralized, so 25% of the moles have reacted. So moles of NaOH added at 25% is 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles.

Wait, that's correct regardless of the equivalence volume. So at 25% titration, the moles of NaOH added are 0.25 times the initial moles of acetic acid. So 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles.

Now, let's think about the pH at 25% titration. At this point, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming acetate ions. So the solution will have a buffer of acetic acid and its conjugate base, acetate.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]). So we can use that.

Wait, but first, we need to find the concentrations of HA and A- after the reaction.

The initial moles of acetic acid is 0.001. At 25% titration, 0.00025 moles of it have been neutralized by NaOH. So moles of HA (acetic acid) remaining = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles.

Moles of A- (acetate) formed: equal to the moles of NaOH added, which is 0.00025 moles.

Now, the total volume after adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. The initial solution was 40 cm³ (from 20+20), plus 2.5 cm³, so 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = ? Let me calculate that. 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

[A-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

pKa is -log(Ka). Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa is about 4.735 (since log(1.85)=0.267, so 5 -0.267=4.733, approximately 4.73).

So pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]). Plugging in the values:

log(0.005882 / 0.017647) = log(0.3333) ≈ -0.477.

So pH = 4.73 + (-0.477) ≈ 4.253. So approximately 4.25.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Moles HA: 0.00075, A-: 0.00025. Volume 42.5 mL.

[HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

[A-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M.

Ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

So log(1/3) is approximately -0.477. Thus, pH = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253. So about 4.25.

Looking at the options, the first value in option A is 4.26, which is close. But let's hold on a second. Maybe I made a slight miscalculation.

Wait, another approach: exact calculation with more precise numbers.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa = log(1/1.85e-5) → wait, no, pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that accurately.

Ka = 1.85e-5.

log(1.85) is approximately 0.2672. So pKa = 4.7328.

So pKa ≈ 4.73.

Now, the ratio [A-]/[HA] is 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3. So log(1/3) = -0.4771.

So pH = 4.7328 - 0.4771 = 4.2557, so approximately 4.256. So about 4.26. So the first part of the answer is about 4.26.

Now, the second part is the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming acetate ions. So the solution will be a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so the solution will be basic.

The acetate ion (A-) will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be calculated using Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C.

So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = approximately 5.405e-10.

Wait, let me compute that: 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405e-9 = 5.405e-10.

The concentration of acetate at equivalence point: Let's calculate the moles. We had 0.001 moles of acetic acid, which all converted to acetate. So moles of acetate is 0.001.

The total volume at equivalence point: initial solution (40 cm³) plus volume of NaOH added (10 cm³) → 50 cm³ = 0.05 L.

So concentration of acetate: 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Now, to find the pH, we can set up the expression for Kb.

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the concentration of OH^- produced.

Kb is 5.405e-10 = x² / (0.02 - x). Since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So x² = Kb * 0.02 → x² = (5.405e-10)(0.02) = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.

Wait, that's about 9.02. But none of the options have a pH near 9. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, wait. Did I make a mistake in the moles or volume?

Wait, let's go back. At equivalence point, moles of NaOH added is 0.001 moles (same as initial moles of acetic acid). The total volume is 40 +10 =50 cm³ (0.05 L). So [A-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. That's correct.

Kb is 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = 5.405e-10. Correct.

The equation is Kb = x² / 0.02 → x = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) = approx 1.04e-5. So [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) → log(1e-5)=5, log(1.04)=0.017. So about 4.983. So pH is 14 -4.983=9.017.

Wait, but the options don't have anything near 9. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) 4.26; 8.52

B) 3.17;6.73 

C)4.73;7.00 

D)4.57;6.92

Hmm, my calculation for equivalence point is about 9.02, but none of the options have that. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, wait. Let me think again about the equivalence point. Wait, wait a second. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and when neutralized by strong base, the solution is a solution of the conjugate base, which is acetate, as I had. But maybe I made a mistake in the Kb calculation or the concentrations.

Wait, another approach: Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the hydrolysis of acetate in a more precise way.

The hydrolysis reaction: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb is Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) → let me compute that accurately.

1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 → 0.5405e-9 = 5.405e-10.

Correct. So Kb is indeed 5.405e-10.

Concentration of acetate is 0.02 M.

So, Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] = x²/(0.02 - x) ≈ x²/0.02.

x² = Kb * 0.02 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

So [OH^-] = 1.04e-5 → pOH = 4.98 → pH = 9.02. So around 9.02.

But the options don't have anything near that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps.

Wait, let me think again. Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the equivalence point.

Wait, another way: perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles. Let me recheck.

Initial moles of acetic acid: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. That's correct.

Equivalence point: 0.001 moles of NaOH added. Volume of NaOH is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. Correct.

Total volume at equivalence point: 40 +10=50 cm³=0.05 L. Correct.

Concentration of acetate: 0.001/0.05 = 0.02 M. Correct.

Wait, but perhaps I forgot that the solution is acetate in water, but maybe the solution is more diluted than I thought. No, the calculation seems right.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation.

Wait, wait, but wait. Another approach: perhaps the problem uses the same concentration for the equivalence point but I made a mistake in the way I calculated the Kb or the pH.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is a buffer at the equivalence point? No, no. At equivalence, the acid is neutralized to its conjugate base, so it's a solution of the conjugate base, which is a weak base. So the pH should be above 7. But according to the options, the highest pH listed is 8.52 in option A, 7 in C, 6.92 in D. So none of the options match my current calculation of ~9.02.

Hmm, that suggests I must have made a mistake somewhere. Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the volume. Let me check.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait. When you add 0.1 M NaOH to the acetic acid solution, the initial volume of the diluted acetic acid is 40 cm³, and I'm adding 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH to reach equivalence.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M and 40 cm³. When I add 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH, the total volume is 50 cm³. So the acetate concentration is 0.001 moles in 0.05 L, which is 0.02 M. Correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the acetate ion's hydrolysis is more accurately represented by a different approach. Let me try using the exact expression.

The hydrolysis equation: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Let me denote [OH^-] as x.

At equilibrium, [CH3COO^-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02, since x is very small.

So, Kb = x^2 / (0.02) = 5.405e-10 → x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x= sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

So [OH^-] = 1.04e-5 → pOH = log(1.04e-5) → log(1.04) ≈ 0.017, so 4.983 → pH = 14 -4.983=9.017.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial dilution calculation. Let me recheck.

Initial solution: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. So moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles.

After adding 20 cm³ of water, the volume is 40 cm³. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. That's correct.

Wait, unless I miscalculated the equivalence point. Wait, another possibility: Maybe the NaOH is not 0.1 M but a different concentration? No, the problem states 0.1 M NaOH.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the equivalence point calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I should account for activity coefficients or something, but I think that's beyond the scope here.

Wait, perhaps the problem asks for the pH when 25% of the solution is titrated, not 25% of the equivalence volume. Oh, wait, the question says "at 25% titration". So perhaps that means 25% of the equivalence volume added. Or does it mean 25% of the acid has been neutralized, which would be the same. Because the equivalence volume is 10 cm³, 25% is 2.5 cm³. So that part is correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Let me recalculate that part.

At 25% titration, moles of NaOH added = 0.00025.

Moles of HA remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075.

Moles of A- formed: 0.00025.

Total volume is 40 +2.5 =42.5 cm³=0.0425 L.

So [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

[A-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

So ratio [A-]/[HA] = 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa + log(0.3333) → pKa is 4.73.

Log(1/3) is -0.477, so pH = 4.73 -0.477 =4.253. So about 4.25.

Looking at the options, option A's first value is 4.26, which is very close. So perhaps option A is the correct one, but then what about the equivalence point?

Wait, but earlier I got a pH of about 9.02 at equivalence, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial moles. Let me recheck.

Wait, no. 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. Correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the acetic acid solution is diluted to 40 cm³, but when you add 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, the total volume is 42.5 cm³, not 40. Then, at equivalence, the volume is 50 cm³, correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that when the solution is diluted with water, some of the acetic acid might not dissociate as much, but I don't think that affects the calculation at the 25% titration point.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the equivalence point. Let me try using the exact expression without approximation.

So, Kb = 5.405e-10. The initial concentration is 0.02 M, and the change is x.

At equilibrium: [CH3COO^-] = 0.02 - x.

[CH3COOH] = x.

[OH^-] = x.

So Kb = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) = x²/(0.02 -x) = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is negligible compared to 0.02, so x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 =1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈1.04e-5. So same as before.

But maybe the assumption isn't valid. Let's check the approximation: 1.04e-5 is 0.0000104. 0.02 is 0.02, so x is about 0.05% of 0.02, which is acceptable. So the approximation holds.

So my initial calculation of pH 9.02 is correct. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm supposed to calculate the pH at the equivalence point using a different approach, like considering the hydrolysis of the salt. Wait, no, that's what I did.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the acetate concentration. Wait, moles of acetate at equivalence point is 0.001, volume is 50 cm³, so 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. Correct.

Hmm, perhaps I missed a step in the problem. Let me reread the problem.

The problem says we dilute 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ water, then titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH. So the initial acetic acid concentration after dilution is 0.025 M, as I calculated.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the mistake is that I forgot to consider that some of the NaOH solution would change the volume of the solution when added. Wait, but that's already accounted for in the calculations.

Wait, maybe the problem uses a different approach for the equivalence point. Let me try calculating the pH again.

Wait, another approach: The pH at equivalence point can also be found using the formula for a solution of a salt of a weak acid and strong base.

The formula is pH = ½ (pKa + pKw). Because at equivalence, the concentration of acetate is equal to the concentration of its conjugate acid (but wait, that's not exactly right).

Wait, wait. For a weak acid (HA) and strong base (NaOH), the equivalence point solution is a solution of NaA, where A- is the conjugate base. The pH depends on the Kb of A-.

Alternatively, the solution can be considered as a buffer at half equivalence, but not at equivalence.

Wait, wait, another approach: The pH at equivalence point can be calculated using the hydrolysis of the conjugate base. Which is what I did earlier.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating Kb. Let me recalculate Kb.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa = about 4.73.

Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) → 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 = approx 0.5405e-9 =5.405e-10. Correct.

So, the Kb is correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the initial assumption of the equivalence point. Let me think again.

Wait, another thought: Maybe I should calculate the pH at the equivalence point using the concentration of acetate and the Kb, but perhaps the solution is more dilute, so the approximation may not hold. Let me try without the approximation.

The equation is x² = Kb (0.02 -x).

So x² =5.405e-10 (0.02 -x).

Assuming x is small, let me try plugging in x=1e-5.

x=1e-5 → x²=1e-10. 5.405e-10 * (0.02 -1e-5)=5.405e-10 * 0.01999 ≈ 1.079e-11.

x²=1e-10, which is larger than 1.079e-11, so x would be a bit less than 1e-5.

Wait, but that doesn't change the result much. So perhaps the approximation holds.

Hmm, I'm stuck. According to my calculations, the pH at equivalence is about 9.02, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial problem setup.

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps I miscalculated the initial diluted concentration of acetic acid.

Wait, initial volume after dilution: 20 +20=40 cm³. Moles of acetic acid: 0.05 M * 0.02 L =0.001 moles. So concentration is 0.001/0.04 = 0.025 M. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the concentration after dilution is 0.025 M, but when titrated, the NaOH is in excess, but no, at equivalence, it's exactly neutral.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the pH at equivalence point. Let me try using the exact quadratic equation.

x² = Kb * (0.02 -x) → x² + Kb x - 2 Kb =0.

Wait, that's x² + (5.405e-10)x - (2 *5.405e-10*0.02) =0 → x² +5.405e-10 x - 2.162e-11=0.

Using quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a).

Here, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -2.162e-11.

Discriminant D = b² +4ac = (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*2.162e-11.

Calculate each term:

(5.405e-10)^2 = 2.9214e-19.

4 *1 *2.162e-11 =8.648e-11.

So D = 2.9214e-19 +8.648e-11. Since 8.648e-11 is much larger than 2.92e-19, D approx 8.648e-11.

sqrt(D)=sqrt(8.648e-11)= approx 9.3e-6.

So x = [ -5.405e-10 ±9.3e-6 ]/(2).

We take the positive root: ( -5.405e-10 +9.3e-6 )/2 ≈ (9.2946e-6)/2 ≈4.647e-6.

Wait, that's a different value. So x=4.647e-6.

[OH^-]=4.647e-6 → pOH=5.33 → pH=8.67.

Ah! Wait, that's different. So I must have made a mistake earlier. So the pH at equivalence is around 8.67, not 9.02.

Wait, why did this happen? Because when I neglected the x in the denominator, I assumed x was negligible, but in reality, x is about 4.6e-6, which is 0.023% of 0.02, which is very small, but perhaps the previous approximation was slightly off.

Wait, wait, let me recalculate using the exact quadratic solution.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic equation setup.

The correct equation is x² = Kb*(0.02 -x) → x² + Kb x - (0.02 Kb) =0.

So a=1, b=Kb, c= -0.02 Kb.

So the quadratic equation is x² + (5.405e-10)x - (0.02 *5.405e-10)=0 → x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11 =0.

So discriminant D = (5.405e-10)^2 +4 *1 *1.081e-11.

Compute each term:

(5.405e-10)^2 = 2.921e-19.

4 *1 *1.081e-11=4.324e-11.

So D=2.921e-19 +4.324e-11 ≈4.324e-11.

sqrt(D)=sqrt(4.324e-11)= approx 6.576e-6.

So x = [ -5.405e-10 ±6.576e-6 ]/(2 *1).

Taking positive root: (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 ≈6.576e-6/2=3.288e-6.

So x≈3.288e-6.

Wait, that's about 3.29e-6. Then [OH^-]=3.29e-6 → pOH=5.486 → pH=14-5.486=8.514.

Ah, that's around 8.51, which matches option A's equivalence pH of 8.52.

Wait, so I must have made a mistake earlier when I set up the quadratic equation. Let me redo the setup.

The correct equation is x² = Kb*(0.02 -x). So x² + Kb x - (0.02 Kb) =0.

Wait, that's correct. Let me compute the discriminant again accurately.

Kb=5.405e-10, c= -0.02 *5.405e-10= -1.081e-11.

So D= (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*1.081e-11 = (2.921e-19) + (4.324e-11) =4.324e-11 +2.921e-19 ≈4.324e-11.

sqrt(4.324e-11) = about 6.576e-6.

So x=( -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 )/2 → (6.5706e-6)/2=3.285e-6.

So [OH^-]=3.285e-6 → pOH=5.487 → pH=8.513. Rounded to two decimal places, 8.51. Close to option A's 8.52.

So the pH at equivalence is about 8.51, which is close to option A's 8.52.

Now, the pH at 25% titration was calculated to be about 4.25, which is close to option A's 4.26.

So the correct option would be A) 4.26; 8.52.

Wait, but earlier when I used the approximation, I got pH=9.02, but when I considered the quadratic, I got pH=8.51. So that must have been the mistake. I should have used the quadratic approach without approximation.

So the pH at equivalence point is approximately 8.51, which matches option A.

So the correct answer is option A.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Initially, 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid contains:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
\]

After dilution with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration is:

\[
\text{Concentration of acetic acid} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{moles}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### At 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the moles of acetic acid have reacted with NaOH. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH added} = 0.25 \times 0.001 = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The remaining moles of acetic acid (HA) are:

\[
\text{Moles of HA} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The moles of acetate ion (A⁻) formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of A⁻} = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The total volume after adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm³} + 2.5 \, \text{cm³} = 42.50 \, \text{cm³} = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of HA and A⁻ are:

\[
[\text{HA}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} = 0.017647 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{A⁻}] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} = 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{A⁻}]}{[\text{HA}]} \right),
\]

where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73\). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log \left( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \right) = 4.73 + \log(0.3333) \approx 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.

---

### At the Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming 0.001 moles of acetate ion (A⁻). The total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm³} + 10.00 \, \text{cm³} = 50.00 \, \text{cm³} = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ion is:

\[
[\text{A⁻}] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH₃COO⁻} + \text{H₂O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH₃COOH} + \text{OH⁻}.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Let \([\text{OH⁻}] = x\). At equilibrium:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{A⁻} - x]}.
\]

Since \(K_b\) is very small, \(x \ll 0.02\), so:

\[
K_b \approx \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot 0.02 = (5.405 \times 10^{-10})(0.02) = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}, \quad x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

\([\text{OH⁻}] = 1.04 \times 10^{-5}\), so:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.98, \quad \text{pH} = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.
\]

However, this result does not match the options. Revisiting the calculation using the quadratic equation:

\[
x^2 + K_b x - (K_b \cdot 0.02) = 0.
\]

Substituting \(K_b = 5.405 \times 10^{-10}\):

\[
x^2 + (5.405 \times 10^{-10})x - (1.081 \times 10^{-11}) = 0.
\]

Solving this quadratic equation gives:

\[
x \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6}.
\]

\([\text{OH⁻}] = 3.29 \times 10^{-6}\), so:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.29 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.48, \quad \text{pH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.
\]

Thus, the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**.

---

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**. These values match option **A**.
