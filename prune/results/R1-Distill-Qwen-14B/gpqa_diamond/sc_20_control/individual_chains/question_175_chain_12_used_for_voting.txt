Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

The question is about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroid-shaped, with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength λ. We're looking at the radiation zone, where the power radiated per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and θ (the angle from the z-axis). The maximum power is A. The question is asking for two things: the fraction of A radiated at θ = 30 degrees, and the possible form of f (like how it depends on λ).

The options are A, B, C, D, each giving a fraction and a λ dependence.

Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on antenna radiation patterns, but I remember that the radiation from a dipole is a good example. Wait, dipole radiation has a certain pattern. Let me think. The power radiated by a dipole varies with the angle θ. The radiation pattern for a dipole is maximum at θ = 90 degrees, and it goes as cos²θ, but wait, that's the radiation pattern for the dipole in terms of the electric field. But for power, which is energy per unit time, or the Poynting vector, I think it's proportional to sin²θ.

Wait, maybe I should be more precise. The power radiated per unit solid angle (the radiation intensity) for a dipole is proportional to sin²θ. So the intensity pattern would be maximum at θ = 90 degrees, and zero at θ = 0 and 180 degrees. The maximum occurs when θ is 90°, which is perpendicular to the dipole's axis.

But in this case, the charge distribution is spheroidal, oscillating along the z-axis. So it's symmetric about the z-axis. So the radiation should have a pattern that depends on θ.

The maximum power A is the maximum value of the function f(λ,θ) over all angles θ. So the maximum occurs at some θ, and the question is asking what fraction A is at θ = 30 degrees.

Wait, but for a dipole, the maximum is at θ=90°, and the intensity there is I_max. The intensity at θ=30° would be I = I_max * sin²(30°). Because intensity is proportional to sin²θ. Wait, I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, the radiation intensity pattern for a dipole is I(θ) ∝ sin²θ. So the maximum is at θ=90°, where sinθ is 1. So at θ=30°, sinθ is 0.5, so sin²θ is 0.25. So the intensity would be 25% of the maximum. So the fraction of the maximum intensity A at θ=30° would be 0.25, which is 1/4. So the fraction is 1/4.

Wait, but the question says, "the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle theta=30°." Wait, that's a bit ambiguous. Because the total power is the integral of the intensity over all solid angles. Wait, no, the maximum power A is the maximum intensity. So the question is, when you look at the intensity at θ=30°, what fraction is that of the maximum intensity A? So that would be f(theta=30°,lambda) / A = [some function of theta] at that angle.

In the dipole case, f(theta) is proportional to sin²theta. So at theta=30°, sin(theta)=0.5, so f = (0.5)^2 = 0.25. So the fraction is 25% of A, which is 1/4. So the first part of the answer is 1/4.

Now the second part: the form of f. The function f is the power per unit solid angle, which is the intensity. For an oscillating dipole, the intensity is proportional to (1/lambda^4), I think. Because the power (or intensity) in electromagnetic radiation usually goes as the square of the fields, and fields for dipole radiation go as 1/r and 1/lambda, so when you square them, you get 1/lambda^2. Wait, but wait, the intensity is power per unit area, which is proportional to E^2. Let me think more carefully.

The electric field for a dipole is E ∝ (p * omega^2) / (r * c^2) * (1/(r)) * sin(theta), where p is the dipole moment, omega is the angular frequency, and r is the distance. Wait, no, let's think about radiation from a dipole. The far field (radiation) for a dipole is E ∝ (1/r) * e^{i(kr - ωt)} * sin(theta). So the amplitude of E is proportional to 1/r and 1/(k), since k=2π/lambda.

Wait, intensity is E times H, but for a plane wave, E and H are related, so Poynting vector S is E x H, which gives intensity as (c/4π) E^2. So the intensity I is proportional to E^2. So E is proportional to (dipole moment) * (omega^2) / (r c^2) ) * sin(theta), because the dipole moment varies as p = q * z * sin(theta), but perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself.

Wait, the dipole moment p is oscillating as p = p_0 sin(omega t). So the far field E is given by something like E ∝ (p_0 omega^2)/(r c^2) ) * (1/(r)) * sin(theta). So E ~ 1/(r c^2) * something. Hmm, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the formula for the intensity.

The intensity (power per unit area) for a dipole radiator is given by I = ( (μ₀ p₀^2 ω^4 )/(12 π c^3 r^2 )) ) * sin²(theta). So I is proportional to (ω^4) / (c^3 r^2). But c = f lambda, and omega is 2π f. So omega^4 = (2π f)^4. Let me express I in terms of lambda.

Since c = f lambda, f = c / lambda. So omega = 2π c / lambda. Then omega^4 = (2π c / lambda )^4 = (2π)^4 c^4 / lambda^4.

So substituting back, I is proportional to (c^4 / lambda^4) / (c^3 r^2) ) = c / (lambda^4 r^2) ). Wait, but in the far field (radiation zone), r is large, and I think the intensity would be considered as a function of lambda and theta, without r dependence because we're in the asymptotic region. Hmm, perhaps I'm complicating things.

Wait, another approach: The power radiated by a dipole is known to be P = ( (μ₀ p₀^2 ω^4 )/(12 π c )) ). So the total power is proportional to ω^4. The intensity is the power per unit solid angle. For a dipole, the intensity varies with theta as sin²(theta), and the total power is the integral over all solid angles, which would be the integral from 0 to pi of sin(theta) * I dtheta dphi. So I_total = ∫ I sin(theta) dtheta dphi. But wait, that's the solid angle integral. Wait, no, the intensity I is power per unit solid angle, so the total power is ∫ I dΩ, where dΩ = sin(theta) dtheta dphi. So the integral of I over all angles would give the total power.

But in any case, the form of I (the intensity) is proportional to (omega^4) sin²(theta) / (c^3 r^2) ), but in the radiation zone, the r dependence is probably not considered because it's in the asymptotic region, so I would be a function of theta and lambda.

Alternatively, perhaps the radiation resistance approach would be better. The power radiated by an oscillating dipole is given by P = ( ( (e^2 a^2 ω^4 )/(6 c^3 ) ) ), where a is the length of the dipole. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but the question is about the functional form of f, which is the intensity (power per unit solid angle) as a function of lambda and theta.

So from what I remember, the intensity pattern for a dipole is I ∝ sin^2(theta) and the intensity also depends on 1/lambda^4. Because the power P is proportional to ω^4, which is (2π f)^4 = (2π c/(lambda))^4, so P ~ c^4/(lambda^4). But the intensity is per unit solid angle, and the total power is the integral of I over all solid angles. So I = (some constant) * sin^2(theta) / lambda^4.

So the function f would be proportional to 1/lambda^4 multiplied by sin^2(theta). So f(theta, lambda) = k * sin^2(theta) / lambda^4. So the form of f would be proportional to lambda^(-4).

So putting it all together: the fraction of the maximum power at theta=30° is 1/4, and the form of f is proportional to lambda^-4.

Looking back at the options, option C says 1/4 and lambda^-4. So the answer should be option C.

The problem involves an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution with symmetry along the z-axis, radiating at a wavelength \( \lambda \). The radiated power per unit solid angle, denoted as \( f(\lambda, \theta) \), depends on \( \lambda \) and the angle \( \theta \) (measured from the z-axis). The goal is to determine the fraction of the maximum power \( A \) radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) and the functional form of \( f \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Radiation Pattern and Fraction of Maximum Power**:
   - For a dipole-like radiation pattern, the intensity \( f(\theta) \) varies as \( \sin^2\theta \). The maximum intensity occurs at \( \theta = 90^\circ \), where \( \sin\theta = 1 \). At \( \theta = 30^\circ \), \( \sin\theta = 0.5 \), so \( \sin^2\theta = 0.25 \).
   - The fraction of the maximum power \( A \) radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is therefore \( 0.25 \), or \( 1/4 \).

2. **Functional Form of \( f \)**:
   - The intensity \( f \) is proportional to \( \sin^2\theta \) and depends on \( \lambda \). For oscillating charge distributions, the intensity typically scales as \( \lambda^{-4} \), reflecting the dependence on the fourth power of the angular frequency \( \omega \), which is related to \( \lambda \) via \( \omega = 2\pi c / \lambda \).
   - Thus, the functional form of \( f \) is \( f(\lambda, \theta) \propto \sin^2\theta / \lambda^4 \).

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: \( 1/2, \lambda^{-4} \) — Incorrect, as the fraction of maximum power at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \( 1/4 \), not \( 1/2 \).
- **Option B**: \( 1/4, \lambda^{-3} \) — Incorrect, as the functional form of \( f \) scales as \( \lambda^{-4} \), not \( \lambda^{-3} \).
- **Option C**: \( 1/4, \lambda^{-4} \) — Correct, as the fraction of maximum power at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \( 1/4 \), and \( f \propto \lambda^{-4} \).
- **Option D**: \( 3/4, \lambda^{-6} \) — Incorrect, as the fraction of maximum power is \( 1/4 \), and \( f \) does not scale as \( \lambda^{-6} \).

### Final Answer:
The fraction of the maximum power radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \( 1/4 \), and the functional form of \( f \) is \( \lambda^{-4} \).
