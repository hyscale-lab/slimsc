Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says that we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, so that's the usual spin-up and spin-down states. I think that means they form an orthonormal basis for the spin-1/2 system.

The task is to calculate two things: first, the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator, and second, find the average value of that operator. The operator has a matrix representation where A_ij is hbar/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, wait, so the operator matrix is 2x2 since the states are spin-up and spin-down.

Let me write down what the matrix A looks like. Since the states are |up> and |down>, which are the basis vectors, the matrix indices i and j go from 1 to 2 perhaps. So A would be a 2x2 matrix. Each diagonal element (i=j) is 0, and the off-diagonal elements (i≠j) are hbar/2. So matrix A is:

[ 0      hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0     ]

Wait, no, wait. The problem states that Aij is hbar/2 when i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements are 0, and the off-diagonal (A_12 and A_21) are hbar/2. So the matrix is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. Wait, no—because for a 2x2 matrix, i and j can be 1 and 2. So A_12 is first row second column, which is hbar/2, and A_21 is second row first column, also hbar/2. So the matrix is:

0      hbar/2
hbar/2 0

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j. So for a 2x2 matrix, that would make the matrix [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. But wait, is this a valid operator? Because if the operator is Hermitian, which it should be for it to have real eigenvalues, then this matrix would be Hermitian. Because A_ij = (A_ji)*, but since A_12 and A_21 are both hbar/2, which is real, so A is symmetric, hence Hermitian. So that's good; the eigenvalues will be real.

Wait, but the problem is about finding the eigenstates of this operator. So maybe the operator is σ_x multiplied by something. Because the Pauli matrices have similar structures. Let me think: the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So if our matrix A is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix, because each off-diagonal element is hbar/2, and the diagonals are zero. So A = (hbar/2) * σ_x.

The eigenstates of σ_x are the eigenstates of the x-projection of spin, which are the spin-up and spin-down along the x-axis. So, the eigenstates of A would be the same as those of σ_x, scaled by hbar/2. So the eigenvalues of σ_x are +1 and -1, so the eigenvalues of A are (hbar/2)*1 = hbar/2 and (hbar/2)*(-1) = -hbar/2.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of this operator. So perhaps the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, which are the eigenstates of σ_x, and our given state |alpha> can be expressed in terms of these. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the eigenstates of A and express |alpha> in that basis, then the probabilities are the square of the amplitudes.

But wait, I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me break down the problem into steps.

First, I need to find the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates of operator A. So I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A. Alternatively, if I can find the eigenstates of A, I can compute the expansion of |alpha> in that basis, and the square of the coefficients would be the probabilities.

Alternatively, since A is (hbar/2) σ_x, perhaps the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively. Let me verify that.

Yes, the eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> and |-x>, where |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). These are orthonormal.

So, the eigenstates of A are the same as those of σ_x, since A is a scalar multiple of σ_x. So the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, with eigenvalues λ1 = hbar/2 and λ2 = -hbar/2.

So, the first step is to express the given state |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, then the coefficients squared will give the probabilities.

But wait, the given |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. Let me normalize it first. Because the problem says it's proportional, so I need to normalize it to get the actual state vector.

Wait, the given state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, but to get |alpha>, perhaps we need to normalize it. Let me compute the norm.

The norm squared is |1+i|^2 + |2 -i|^2.

Compute |1+i|^2: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

Wait no: |a + ib|^2 = a² + b². So |1+i|² = 1² +1² = 2.

Similarly, |2 - i|² = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1 =5.

So the total norm squared is 2 +5 =7. So the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

So |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Now, I need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

We know that |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, let me write |alpha> in terms of these.

Let me denote |alpha> = a |+x> + b |-x>.

Wait, because |+x> and |-x> form a basis, any state can be expressed as a combination of these.

So, |alpha> = a |+x> + b |-x>.

Expressing in terms of |up> and |down>, this is:

a (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + b (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

= [ a + b ] |up> / sqrt(2) + [ a - b ] |down> / sqrt(2).

Comparing this to |alpha> which is:

(1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

So, equating the coefficients:

[ (a + b) ] / sqrt(2) = (1 + i)/sqrt(7) , equation 1

[ (a - b) ] / sqrt(2) = (2 -i)/sqrt(7) , equation 2.

We can solve these two equations for a and b.

Let me write them as:

a + b = [ (1 + i) * sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(7 )

a - b = [ (2 - i) * sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(7 )

Adding equations 1 and 2:

2a = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7 )

Simplify (1+i) + (2 -i) = 3 +0i =3.

So 2a = 3 * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7 )

Thus, a = (3 * sqrt(2))/(2 * sqrt(7)) )

Similarly, subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

2b = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7 )

(1+i) - (2 - i) = (1-2) + (i +i) = (-1) + 2i = -1 +2i.

So 2b = (-1 +2i) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7 )

Thus, b = (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)).

Now, the coefficients a and b are the amplitudes for |+x> and |-x> respectively. The probabilities are |a|² and |b|².

Compute |a|²:

a = [3√2]/(2√7) 

So |a|² = (9 * 2) / (4 *7) )= 18/(28) = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Similarly, compute |b|²:

b = [ (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7) )

The modulus squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] * (2) / (4 *7 )

Because |(-1 +2i)|² is (1 +4) =5.

Wait, no. Let me compute it more carefully.

|b|^2 = [ (sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7))) ]^2 * | (-1 + 2i) |^2.

The [sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7))]^2 is (2)/(4 *7) ) = 2/(28) = 1/14.

And | (-1 +2i) |² is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1 +4 =5.

So |b|² = (1/14) *5 =5/14 ≈ 0.3571.

Wait, but wait—so the probabilities are |a|²=9/14 ≈0.64286 and |b|²=5/14 ≈0.35714.

But wait, that doesn't add up to exactly 1? Let me check the calculations.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857 and 5/14 is approximately 0.35714. 9+5=14, so 14/14=1. So correct.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64286 and 0.35714, which are 9/14 and 5/14 respectively.

But looking at the options, let's see.

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 — which are roughly 9/14≈0.642857 and 5/14≈0.3571. So 0.64 and 0.36 are close. So the first part of the answer would match option A, which has probabilities 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait, but I should recheck my calculations because in option D, the probabilities are 0.61 and 0.29, which don't match.

Wait, no, another thought: could I have made a mistake in the expansion of |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>?

Let me re-express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x> perhaps using a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps we can approach this by finding the eigenstates of operator A and then projecting |alpha> onto them.

Wait, operator A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. Its eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2, as we found earlier.

The corresponding eigenvectors are |+x> and |-x> as I wrote.

But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of a and b. Let me recompute.

So, from the system of equations:

a + b = (1+i) sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)

a - b = (2 -i) sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)

Adding them:

2a = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) = [3] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)

So a = 3 * sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)).

Similarly, subtracting equation 2 from 1:

2b = [ (1 +i) - (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) 

= [ (1-2) + (i +i) ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) 

= [ (-1) + 2i ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)

So b = [ (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7)) 

Which is correct.

So the mod squared is |a|² = (3^2 * 2) / (4 *7) )= 18/(28) = 9/14 ≈0.642857, and |b|²= [ (-1)^2 +2^2 ) * 2 ] / (4 *7) )= (5 *2)/(28) =10/28=5/14≈0.35714.

So the first part of the question, the probabilities, are approximately 0.64 and 0.36. So the options A, D, etc. Let me look at the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7.

Option B: 0.54, 0.46, 3hbar/sqrt(7).

Option C: 0.28, 0.72, hbar/sqrt(7).

Option D: 0.61, 0.29, 2hbar/sqrt(7).

So only option A has probabilities around 0.64 and 0.36. So I think the first part would pick option A.

But wait, let me check the average value of the operator A.

The average value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is diagonal in the |+x> and |-x> basis, and |alpha> is a combination of these eigenstates, the average value is |a|^2 * (hbar/2) + |b|^2 * (-hbar/2).

So plugging in the values:

|a|^2 =9/14, |b|^2=5/14.

Average = (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2) = [ (9/14 -5/14) ) * hbar/2 ].

Which is (4/14) * hbar/2 = (2/7) * (hbar/2) )= hbar/(7).

So the average is hbar/7.

Looking at option A, the average is hbar/7, which matches.

So the first part of the answer is 9/14 ≈0.64 and 5/14≈0.36. So the options for probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is hbar/7. So option A has these numbers.

But wait, let me double-check the average value using another method to be sure.

Another way to compute the average value is to compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

Given that |alpha> is (1+i)|up>/(sqrt(7)) + (2 -i)|down>/(sqrt(7)).

So the bra vector is (1-i)/sqrt(7) <up| + (2 +i)/sqrt(7) <down|.

The operator A is (hbar/2) |up><down| + (hbar/2)|down><up|.

So when we compute <alpha| A |alpha>, it's (hbar/2) [ <alpha| up><down | alpha> + <alpha| down><up | alpha> ].

Let's compute each term.

First term: <alpha| up> is (1-i)/sqrt(7). <down | alpha> is (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So the first term is (hbar/2) * (1-i)(2 -i) /7.

Second term: <alpha| down> is (2 +i)/sqrt(7). <up | alpha> is (1 +i)/sqrt(7).

So the second term is (hbar/2) * (2 +i)(1 +i)/7.

Let me compute these terms.

First term: (1-i)(2-i) = (1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i) = 2 -i -2i +i² = 2 -3i -1 = (2-1) -3i =1 -3i.

So first term = (hbar/2) * (1 -3i)/7 = (hbar/2) (1-3i)/7.

Second term: (2 +i)(1 +i) =2*1 +2*i +i*1 +i*i =2 + 2i +i +i²= 2+3i -1 = (2-1)+3i =1 +3i.

Second term = (hbar/2) * (1 +3i)/7.

Now, adding the two terms together:

Total = (hbar/2)(1-3i +1 +3i)/7 = (hbar/2)(2)/7 )= (hbar/2)(2/7) )= hbar/7.

Which confirms the earlier result.

So the average value is hbar/7, which matches option A's third value.

So the correct answer should be option A: 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7.

Wait, but let me check the other options to make sure I'm not missing anything. For example, option D has an average of 2hbar/sqrt(7). Let me see if I messed up the calculation.

Wait, another approach: what if I represent the state |alpha> as a vector and compute the expectation value of A as a matrix product.

The state |alpha> is ( (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) )^T.

The operator A is a 2x2 matrix:

[ [0, hbar/2],
  [hbar/2, 0] ]

The expectation value is (1/sqrt(7)) (1+i, 2 -i) * A * (1/sqrt(7)) (1+i; 2 -i).

Wait, no, because the expectation is the conjugate transpose times A times the state.

So it's (1/sqrt(7)) (1-i, 2 +i) * A * (1/sqrt(7)) (1+i; 2 -i).

Multiply it out:

The first step is to compute A * |alpha>.

A * |alpha> = [ [0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0] ] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

So first component is 0*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + (hbar/2)*(2 -i)/sqrt(7) = (hbar/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7).

Second component is (hbar/2)*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + 0*(2-i)/sqrt(7) = (hbar/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7).

Then, the conjugate transpose of |alpha> is [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2+i)/sqrt(7) ].

Multiply this by the result of A|alpha>:

(1-i)/sqrt(7) * [ (hbar/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] + (2+i)/sqrt(7) * [ (hbar/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7) ]

Factor out (hbar/2) and 1/7:

= (hbar/2) [ (1-i)(2 -i) + (2+i)(1+i) ] /7.

Compute each product:

(1-i)(2 -i) = 2 -i -2i +i² = 2-3i -1 =1-3i.

(2+i)(1+i)= 2(1) +2i +i(1) +i^2 = 2+3i -1 =1+3i.

Adding them: (1-3i) + (1+3i) )=2.

So overall: (hbar/2)(2)/(7) )= (hbar/2)(2/7) )= hbar/7.

Which again, matches. So the expectation is hbar/7.

So the average is hbar/7, which is option A.

Therefore, the correct answer is option A: probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, average hbar/7.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the given state and operator step by step.

### Step 1: Normalize the state
The given state is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). To normalize it, we calculate the norm squared:

\[
\| (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \|^2 = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{(1+i)}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{(2-i)}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of the operator
The operator \( A \) has the matrix representation:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This is equivalent to \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli \( x \)-matrix. The eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \) are \( |+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle) \) and \( |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle) \), with eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively. Thus, the eigenstates of \( A \) are the same as those of \( \sigma_x \), with eigenvalues \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \).

### Step 3: Express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \)
We write \( |\alpha\rangle \) as:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = a |+x\rangle + b |-x\rangle.
\]

Expanding \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) in terms of \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \), we have:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{a + b}{\sqrt{2}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{a - b}{\sqrt{2}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

Comparing this with the given \( |\alpha\rangle = \frac{(1+i)}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{(2-i)}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle \), we solve for \( a \) and \( b \):

\[
a + b = \frac{(1+i)\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{7}}, \quad a - b = \frac{(2-i)\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]

Adding and subtracting these equations:

\[
2a = \frac{(1+i) + (2-i)}{\sqrt{7}} \sqrt{2}, \quad 2b = \frac{(1+i) - (2-i)}{\sqrt{7}} \sqrt{2}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
a = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{7}}, \quad b = \frac{(-1 + 2i)\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{7}}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate probabilities
The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are \( |a|^2 \) and \( |b|^2 \), respectively:

\[
|a|^2 = \left(\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{7}}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{14}, \quad |b|^2 = \left(\frac{(-1 + 2i)\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{7}}\right)^2 = \frac{5}{14}.
\]

Thus, the probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \).

### Step 5: Calculate the average value of \( A \)
The average value of \( A \) is given by:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle.
\]

Using the eigenstate decomposition, \( \langle A \rangle = |a|^2 \frac{\hbar}{2} + |b|^2 \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) \). Substituting \( |a|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \) and \( |b|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \):

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{9 - 5}{14} \frac{\hbar}{2} = \frac{4}{14} \frac{\hbar}{2} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities are \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: A**
