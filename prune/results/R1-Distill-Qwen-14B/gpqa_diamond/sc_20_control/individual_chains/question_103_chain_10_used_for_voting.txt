Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right sequence of reactions to make 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. Hmm. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, looking at the structure, the benzene ring has substituents at the 3 and 5 positions. The 3 position has a bromo group, and the 5 position has a nitro group. Also, there's an ethanone group attached to the benzene ring—so that's a ketone group connected to two carbons.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, ethan-1-one would be (CH3)2CO, but I think in the context, it's a ketone attached at the para or something else position. No, wait, the formula is 1-(substituted phenyl)ethan-1-one. Oh, right, that would be a benzene ring with a ketone group attached to it. So the structure is benzene with a ketone (like a C=O) group attached to a CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, ethan-1-one is CH3-C(O)-, so if it's 1-(substituted phenyl)ethan-1-one, that's a phenyl group attached to the first carbon of ethan-1-one. So the structure is Ph-C(O)-CH3? No wait. Wait, ethan-1-one is (CH3)2CO, but I'm getting confused. Wait, actually, ethan-1-one is acetone: (propan-2-one), but maybe I'm getting that wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzene ring with a ketone group attached, which would be acetophenone. Wait, but the substituents are at 3 and 5 positions relative to the ketone group.

Wait, the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the benzene ring is attached to the ketone. Let me imagine the benzene ring as the substituent on the ketone. The ketone is at position 1, so the structure would be (C6H3Br(NO2))(3,5)–C(O)CH3? Or is it (C6H3Br(NO2))(3,5)–C(O)CH2– something? Wait, maybe I should draw it mentally. So the benzene ring has a ketone group attached. The positions 3 and 5 (relative to the point of attachment) have Br and NO2 groups.

Wait, the numbering: if the ketone is attached at position 1, then the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 on the ring. So the benzene ring is connected to the ketone, and at positions 3 and 5 (relative to that point) are Br and NO2 groups.

So the synthesis starts with benzene. We need to add substituents in a way that ends up with the correct substituents in the correct positions.

The substituents we have are: a ketone group (from ethanone), a bromo group, and a nitro group. The positions are 3 and 5 bromo and nitro.

I need to plan the synthesis steps. Let's think about the directing effects of each substituent.

Nitro groups are meta-directing. Bromine is ortho/para (since it's a halogen), but wait, if it's attached as a substituent on the benzene, its directing effect depends on whether it's activating or deactivating. Bromine is deactivating, so it's ortho/para directing. Nitro groups are meta directors.

Now, the problem is about the order of introducing these substituents. Because each substitution directs the next.

Wait, but ethanone is a ketone, which is a meta director. So, if I first introduce, say, the nitro group, then bromine, then the ketone, I have to consider how each step affects the next.

Alternatively, maybe I should introduce the ketone last because it's a strong deactivating group. Wait, but the ketone is an electron-withdrawing group, so it would deactivate the ring. Hmm.

Wait, the target molecule has three substituents: Br at 3, nitro at 5, and the ketone at the attached position (let's call that position 1). So, the benzene ring has substituents at 1,3,5. So it's a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene. Wait, but the target has substituents at 3 and 5 relative to the ketone. So the ketone is at position 1, Br at 3, and nitro at 5.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think of the benzene ring as having the ketone group attached to it (position 1). Then, the substituents (Br and nitro) are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone. So, they are in meta positions relative to each other. So, the substituents are at 3 and 5.

So I need to figure out the order of adding these substituents to benzene so that they end up in the correct positions.

Let me think about possible reaction sequences.

Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts acylation); ii) Br2/FeBr3 (bromination); iii) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration); iv) Fe/HCl (maybe reduction?); v) HNO3/H2SO4; vi) NaNO2/HCl; vii) H3PO2.

Hmm. Let's see. Starting with benzene.

1. Friedel-Crafts acylation would add the ketone group. Benzene would become acetophenone.

But wait, benzene is treated with CH3COCl and AlCl3. So first step is adding the ketone group.

Now, the ring is meta-directing because of the ketone (which is a meta director). So the next substitution (bromination) would happen at meta positions relative to the ketone.

But wait, if after adding the ketone, the next step is bromination. Let's see, acetophenone is a meta director. So bromination (Br2, FeBr3) would add Br at the meta position relative to the ketone.

So after steps i and ii, we have a benzene ring with ketone at position 1 and Br at position 3.

Then step iii is nitration. Since the ring now has the ketone (meta director) and Br (ortho/para, but deactivating). The nitration would be directed by the strongest director. The ketone is a stronger deactivating group than Br, so the nitration would be directed by the ketone. So the nitro group would go into the meta position relative to the ketone, which is position 5, but wait, position 5 relative to the ketone is already occupied by Br. Wait, no, after adding Br at position 3, and the ketone at 1, the meta positions would be 4 and 5. Wait, let me think of the ring positions. If ketone is at position 1, the meta positions are 3 and 5. Oh, but in step ii, Br is added at 3. So in step iii, nitration will be directed to position 5.

So after step iii, we have Br at 3 and nitro at 5, attached to the ketone. So the product would be 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Wait, that's the target. But wait, the options have more steps. So what's next?

Step iv: Fe/HCl. Fe in HCl would be a reducing condition. Maybe Fe/HCl is used for removing nitro groups. Wait, nitro groups can be reduced to amines, but in this case, is that necessary? Because the target has a nitro group, so maybe this step isn't correct. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the steps.

Wait, after the nitration, in step iii, the product is the target. But in the options, the steps continue. So maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence is not correct because after the nitration, other steps might be adding or modifying groups.

Wait, maybe I'm missing that the nitration actually occurs before the bromination. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the order is wrong. Because if I first brominate, then nitrate. Let's think again.

Another approach: perhaps the ketone is introduced last. Because it's a strong deactivating group, and might block certain positions. So if I first add nitro and bromo groups, then add the ketone.

Wait, but how? Because Friedel-Crafts acylation requires the ring to be activated. If the ring already has deactivating groups, the acylation might not occur.

So perhaps the ketone must be introduced early, before the deactivating groups.

Wait, so the first step is acylation: benzene becomes acetophenone (if possible). Then, bromine is added meta to the ketone, then nitration meta to the ketone again. But then, where are the substituents?

Wait, let's try this step by step.

Option B: i) Br2/FeBr3 (bromination of benzene); ii) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration); iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 (acylation); iv) HNO3/H2SO4; etc.

Wait, but if you first brominate benzene, you get bromobenzene. Then nitrating would be directed by bromine, which is ortho/para. So nitration would add nitro at either ortho or para to Br. Then acylation—how? Because Friedel-Crafts requires an activated ring. But nitro is deactivating, which would make the ring less reactive towards electrophilic substitution. Hmm. So perhaps that's not feasible.

So maybe the ketone needs to be introduced early, before any deactivating groups, because Friedel-Crafts requires an activated ring.

So let's consider the correct order. Let me think of the substituents. We need to have a ketone group, a bromo group, and a nitro group on the benzene ring. The ketone is a meta director, so the bromo and nitro groups should be added in positions directed by the ketone.

So the plan is: first, introduce the ketone via acylation (Friedel-Crafts). Then, add bromine in the meta position relative to the ketone. Then, add nitro group in another meta position relative to the ketone.

Wait, but after adding Br and nitro, would they be at 3 and 5 positions? Let me see.

After acylation (step i), we have acetophenone. Then bromination (step ii) would add Br at meta position (position 3). Then, nitration (step iii) would add nitro at position 5, since that's the next meta position.

Wait, does that work? So after steps i, ii, iii, we would have the target molecule. But looking at the options, none of them have only three steps. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the options have seven steps each. So perhaps some steps are for protection or other functional group transformations.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the nitro group is added before the bromine. Let's think: if I first acylate (ketone), then nitrate (nitro group), which would be meta to the ketone, then brominate. But where would the bromine go?

Wait, let's walk through that. Step i: acylation (ketone at 1). Step ii: nitration—nitro group would go meta to ketone, so position 3. Then step iii: bromination. The ring now has ketone (meta) and nitro (meta to ketone, ortho to bromine if added here). Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, in step iii, after acylation and nitration, the substituents are ketone (1) and nitro (3). The nitro group is a strong meta director. So bromination would be directed by the nitro group. Where are the possible positions?

Nitro at 3: bromine would enter at position 1 (already taken by ketone) or position 5 (meta to nitro). So in this case, bromine would add at position 5.

Wait, but in the target molecule, bromine is at 3 and nitro at 5. Wait, no, the target has Br at 3 and nitro at 5, both relative to the ketone.

So if I first acylate (1), then nitrate (3), then brominate (5). But in that case, the bromine is at position 5, which is meta to the ketone (position 1), but ortho to the nitro group at 3.

Wait, but the target has bromine at 3. So that approach would place it at 5, which is not what we want.

Hmm. So perhaps the order is different. Let me think: after acylation, perhaps bromination comes before nitration.

So step i: acylation (position 1). Step ii: bromination adds Br at position 3. Step iii: nitration adds nitro. But where?

At this point, the ring has ketone (1), Br (3). The ketone is a meta director, and Br is ortho/para. Which group is stronger in directing?

The ketone is a stronger deactivating group than Br. So nitration would be directed by the ketone. So nitro would go to position 5, which is meta to the ketone.

So after step iii, we have ketone (1), Br (3), nitro (5). That's exactly the target. So steps i, ii, iii.

But the options have more steps. So perhaps I'm missing some steps that might involve other functional group transformations or protection.

Wait, looking back at the options, let me see option C.

Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2.

Wait, that starts with nitration. So benzene first gets a nitro group. Then Fe/HCl is likely a reduction step, turning nitro to amine. Then acylation—so benzene with an amine group gets an acetyl group via Friedel-Crafts? But amine is a strong activating group, ortho/para director. So after the amine, acylation would add the ketone.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Option C: steps are nitration, Fe/HCl (probably reduces nitro to NH2), then acylation. Hmm, but after nitration, benzene becomes nitrobenzene. Then Fe/HCl would reduce nitro to amino. So then, we have aniline. Then, step iii is acylation: AlCl3 and CH3COCl would perform Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. However, aniline is a strong activating group, so the acylation would occur ortho or para to the amino group. But then, the next step is Br2/FeBr3. So after acylation, the ring has an amine and a ketone group. But wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps after acylation, we have aniline toluene or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the steps are introducing substituents in a way that allows the right positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is introducing the nitro group first, then the bromine, then the ketone.

But wait, I'm not sure. Let's think about all options.

Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl; iii) NaNO2/HCl; iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3; vii) HNO3/H2SO4.

Starting with nitration (step i), benzene becomes nitrobenzene. Step ii: Fe/HCl reduces nitro to amine (NH2). Step iii: NaNO2/HCl (diazotization) would convert the amine to a diazonium salt. Step iv: H3PO2 (which is a mild reducing agent, perhaps for something else). Then step v: bromination. Step vi: acylation. Step vii: nitration again.

Hmm, but I'm not sure how that would place the substituents correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the target requires that the bromine is added before the nitro group. But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of directing effects and the correct positions.

The target is 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl attached to ethanone. So, the substituents are at 3 and 5 relative to the ketone.

So, the ketone (group A) is at position 1, bromine (group B) at position 3, and nitro (group C) at position 5.

To get these positions, we need to introduce the substituents in a way that each directs the next to the correct position.

Suppose we start with benzene. First, introduce group A (ketone). Then, group B (bromine) is introduced, which is meta to group A. Then, group C (nitro) is introduced, which is meta to group A as well. But wait, in that case, group B and group C would be meta to each other, but that's okay.

So the steps would be: acylation (group A), bromination (group B), nitration (group C).

Wait, but the ketone is a meta director. So, when introducing group B, the bromine would go meta to A. Then, group C (nitro) would go meta to A again, but that position is either taken or not.

Wait, if group A is at 1, group B is at 3, then group C (nitro) would go to 5, which is meta to A and not adjacent to B. Because group B is at 3, which is ortho to group C at 5. Wait, no, group B is at 3 and group C is at 5, which are meta to each other. Hmm, that's possible.

So the sequence would be acylation, bromination, nitration.

Looking back at the options, which one follows this order?

Looking at option A:

i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 (acylation)
ii) Br2/FeBr3 (bromination)
iii) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration)
iv) Fe/HCl
v) HNO3/H2SO4
vi) NaNO2/HCl
vii) H3PO2

Wait, after steps i, ii, iii, we have the target. So why continue with steps iv to vii? Because perhaps some of these steps are unnecessary or I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the synthesis requires more steps, maybe some functional group transformations.

Wait, wait. Friedel-Crafts acylation requires benzene to be activated. If after acylation, the ring is deactivated, then further substitution is difficult. So perhaps introducing the bromine and nitro groups before the acylation isn't possible because the ring is deactivated. So the correct order must be acylation first, then bromine, then nitro.

But looking at the options, which option starts with acylation? Option A starts with i) acylation. So steps i, ii, iii would be acylation, bromination, nitration.

So the product after step iii would be 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone, which is the target. But in option A, there are more steps. Steps iv to vii involve Fe/HCl, nitration again, NaNO2, H3PO2. I'm not sure why those would be included. Maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitration is done after bromination, but in a way that the nitro group is added para to the bromine but meta to the ketone. Wait, but that would complicate the positions.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the nitro group is added before the bromine. Let's say, acylation first, then nitration, then bromination. So step i: acylation (position 1). Step ii: nitration. Where? Nitration would be directed by the ketone (meta), so nitro at position 3. Step iii: bromination, directed by the ketone (meta) and the nitro group (meta to nitro is position 1 and 5). So bromine would go to position 5, which is meta to the ketone and para to the nitro. But then the product would have nitro at 3 and Br at 5. But in the target, Br is at 3 and nitro at 5. So that's the reverse.

Hmm.

So perhaps the correct order is acylation, bromination, and then nitration. So option A's first three steps would give the target. But why are there more steps in option A?

Looking at the target, perhaps the nitro group is added after the bromine. Let me check the steps again.

Option A: after steps i, ii, iii, we have the target. So why are there more steps? Maybe the steps iv to vii are for something else. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the target structure.

Wait, perhaps the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the ketone is at position 1, and the substituents are at 3 (Br) and 5 (NO2). So, to achieve this, after acylation, bromination would add Br at 3, then nitration at 5.

So, in option A, steps i,ii,iii give the target. Then steps iv to vii: iv is Fe/HCl, which I think is used for reduction, perhaps of nitro groups. But why would they reduce after adding the nitro group? That would change the substituent.

Wait, perhaps the nitration in step iii isn't correct. Maybe the nitro group is added in a different position.

Alternatively, perhaps the synthesis requires protection of certain groups or involves some elimination steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine is added after the nitro group, but in that case, the nitro group would direct the bromine to a different position.

Alternatively, maybe the nitro group is introduced before the bromine, but then the bromine ends up in the correct position.

Wait, maybe the correct order is acylation, nitration, bromination. Let's think.

Step i: acylation (ketone at 1). Step ii: nitration (nitro at 3). Step iii: bromination (directed by ketone, would go to 5). So the product would have nitro at 3, Br at 5. But the target has Br at 3 and nitro at 5. So that's the opposite.

Hmm. So that approach doesn't work. So that's why the correct order must be acylation, bromination, nitration.

So, in that case, the correct option would be the one that starts with acylation, then bromination, then nitration.

Looking at the options:

Option A: i) acylation; ii) bromination; iii) nitration.

So, after step iii, the product is the target. But in option A, there are steps iv to vii. So why those steps?

Wait, perhaps the nitration in step iii isn't correct because the bromine is a stronger director. Wait, after acylation and bromination, the ring has ketone (meta) and Br (ortho/para). So when nitrating, which group directs?

The ketone is a stronger deactivating group than Br. So the nitro would go into the position meta to the ketone, which is position 5, since position 3 is already occupied by Br.

So after steps i, ii, iii, the product is correct.

But why does option A have more steps? Maybe the question is about high-yield synthesis, and the steps involve more than just substitution.

Wait, maybe the steps after iii are for something else. Step iv is Fe/HCl. Maybe that's for reducing something, but after nitration, what would that do? Or perhaps it's a typo, and the steps are not in order. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitration in step iii is done under certain conditions that don't add the nitro group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Let me think about option C.

Option C: steps are nitration, Fe/HCl (reduction), acylation, bromination, nitration, diazotization, H3PO2.

Wait, starting with benzene, step i: nitration gives nitrobenzene. Step ii: Fe/HCl (probably reduction) converts nitro to amine. So now we have aniline. Step iii: acylation (Friedel-Crafts) would add the ketone in the presence of the amine group. But amine is a strong activating group, so the acylation would occur ortho/para to the amine.

Wait, but the ketone is a meta director, but when added after an activating group, the position would be directed by the amine.

So, if we have aniline (NH2 at position 1), then acylation would add the ketone at position 3 or 5 (ortho or para to NH2). Wait, no, NH2 is a strong activating group, so in Friedel-Crafts acylation, the ketone would enter at para position relative to NH2.

So after step iii, the structure would be 4-acetophenylamine? Or not? Wait, no, because the acylation would happen at position 4 relative to the NH2 group.

But in any case, after that, the next step is bromination (step iv: Br2/FeBr3). The ring now has NH2 (position 1), ketone (position 4), and bromine would be directed by the strongest director, which is the ketone? Or the NH2?

Wait, NH2 is a strong activating group, so it's a strong director. So bromine would enter ortho or para to NH2. But in this case, the NH2 is at position 1, and the ketone is at position 4 (para to NH2).

So, bromination would add at position 2 (ortho to NH2) or position 4 (but that's already taken by the ketone), so position 6 (another para, but that's not adjacent). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the ring now has NH2 at 1, ketone at 4. So the possible positions for bromine are 2, 3, 5, 6.

But since the NH2 is a strong director, bromine would go ortho or para. So position 2 or 6 (ortho) or position 4 (para, but already taken). So maybe position 2 or 6. But then, after bromination, step v is another nitration. Not sure.

This seems complicated. Maybe option C isn't the correct one.

Looking back, perhaps option D is correct. Let me think.

Option D: i) nitration; ii) Fe/HCl; iii) NaNO2/HCl; iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3; vi) acylation; vii) nitration.

Wait, this seems a bit odd. Starting with nitration, then reduction to amine, then diazotization, then H3PO2 (which is a reducing agent, but for what?), then bromination, acylation, then nitration again.

I'm not sure. It's getting too complicated.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option C.

Wait, another approach: the positions of substituents are 3 and 5 relative to the ketone. So, if I have the ketone at position 1, then substituents are at 3 and 5. That's a meta and para positions relative to each other.

Wait, but in any case, perhaps the correct sequence is to first acylate, then brominate (meta to ketone), then nitrate (meta to ketone, but that position is available because bromine is at 3). So the nitro goes at 5.

So the correct steps are acylation, bromination, nitration.

Looking at the options, option A has these first three steps. So why does it have more steps? Perhaps option A is the correct one, but the additional steps are a distractor.

Wait, but why would the sequence require more steps? Maybe the actual reaction requires more steps, but the correct order is present in the correct option.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option C. Let me think again.

Option C: i) nitration; ii) Fe/HCl (reduce nitro to amine); iii) acylation; iv) bromination; v) nitration; vi) diazotization; vii) H3PO2.

Wait, after step iii, we have aniline with a ketone group. Then bromination would happen, but where? The ring has an amine group (strong director) and a ketone. So bromine would go ortho or para to the amine. Let's say ketone is at position 4 relative to amine (position 1). So bromine would go to position 2 or 6 (ortho), or position 4 (para, but taken by ketone). Then step v is nitration, which would be directed by the strongest group, which is the amine. So nitration would likely go ortho or para to the amine. But I'm not sure how that would lead to the correct substituents.

This is getting a bit too involved. Maybe I should consider looking for the correct option based on the initial steps.

So, the correct order is acylation, bromination, nitration. Which is the first three steps of option A. So the correct option is A.

But in option A, after step iii, the product is correct, but the remaining steps are unclear. Wait, perhaps I'm missing that the nitration in step iii is not the correct position.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the nitration occurs before the bromination, but in a way that the nitro group is added at position 5, then the bromine at 3. But for that to happen, the nitro group must be a meta director, so after acylation, nitration would add nitro at 3, then bromine would go to 5. Or no, wait.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think of the options again.

Looking at option B:

i) Br2/FeBr3; ii) HNO3/H2SO4; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3; iv) HNO3/H2SO4; etc.

So first, bromination: benzene becomes bromobenzene. Then nitration: nitro group would go ortho or para to Br. Let's say ortho: position 2, or para: position 4. Then acylation: would the ring be reactive enough? Because Br is deactivating, but perhaps possible. So after acylation, the ring has Br (1), nitro (3), and ketone (4). Hmm, but that doesn't fit the target.

Alternatively, after step i, bromine at 1. Step ii, nitration adds nitro at 3. Step iii, acylation adds ketone at 5. So positions 1 (Br), 3 (nitro), 5 (ketone). Wait, but that's opposite of what we need.

The target has ketone at 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5. So that's not matching.

Hmm.

So, the correct sequence must be acylation first, then bromination, then nitration. So the first three steps of option A. So option A is the correct one.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene, the key is to introduce the substituents in the correct order, considering the directing effects of each group. The target molecule has a ketone group at position 1, a bromine atom at position 3, and a nitro group at position 5 relative to the ketone. The ketone is a meta-directing group, while bromine and nitro groups are ortho/para-directing and meta-directing, respectively.

### Analysis of the Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **Step i**: Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the ketone group at position 1. The benzene ring becomes acetophenone.
2. **Step ii**: Bromination with Br₂/FeBr₃ adds bromine at position 3, meta to the ketone.
3. **Step iii**: Nitration with HNO₃/H₂SO₄ adds the nitro group at position 5, meta to the ketone.
4. **Steps iv–vii**: These steps appear unnecessary for achieving the target molecule, as the product is already formed after step iii.

This sequence correctly places the substituents in the desired positions.

#### **Option B**:
1. **Step i**: Bromination adds bromine to benzene, forming bromobenzene.
2. **Step ii**: Nitration adds a nitro group ortho or para to bromine, which does not align with the target structure.
3. **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the ketone, but the positions of bromine and nitro would already be incorrect.

This sequence does not yield the target molecule.

#### **Option C**:
1. **Step i**: Nitration adds a nitro group to benzene, forming nitrobenzene.
2. **Step ii**: Reduction with Fe/HCl converts the nitro group to an amine.
3. **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the ketone, but the amine group would strongly direct substitution, making it difficult to achieve the correct positions.
4. **Steps iv–vii**: Subsequent bromination and nitration steps do not align with the target structure.

This sequence does not yield the target molecule.

#### **Option D**:
1. **Step i**: Nitration adds a nitro group to benzene.
2. **Step ii**: Reduction with Fe/HCl converts the nitro group to an amine.
3. **Step iii**: Diazotization with NaNO₂/HCl and reduction with H₃PO₂ do not contribute to the desired substitution pattern.
4. **Step iv**: Bromination adds bromine, but the positions remain incorrect.
5. **Step v**: Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the ketone, but the substituents are already misplaced.

This sequence does not yield the target molecule.

### Conclusion:
The correct sequence is **Option A**, as it introduces the ketone first, followed by bromine and nitro groups in the correct meta positions. The additional steps in Option A are unnecessary but do not interfere with the formation of the target molecule.

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right sequence of reactions to make 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. Hmm. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, looking at the structure, the benzene ring has substituents at the 3 and 5 positions. The 3 position has a bromo group, and the 5 position has a nitro group. Also, there's an ethanone group attached to the benzene ring—so that's a ketone group connected to two carbons.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, ethan-1-one would be (CH3)2CO, but I think in the context, it's a ketone attached at the para or something else position. No, wait, the formula is 1-(substituted phenyl)ethan-1-one. Oh, right, that would be a benzene ring with a ketone group attached to it. So the structure is benzene with a ketone (like a C=O) group attached to a CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, ethan-1-one is CH3-C(O)-, so if it's 1-(substituted phenyl)ethan-1-one, that's a phenyl group attached to the first carbon of ethan-1-one. So the structure is Ph-C(O)-CH3? No wait. Wait, ethan-1-one is (CH3)2CO, but I'm getting confused. Wait, actually, ethan-1-one is acetone: (propan-2-one), but maybe I'm getting that wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzene ring with a ketone group attached, which would be acetophenone. Wait, but the substituents are at 3 and 5 positions relative to the ketone group.

Wait, the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the benzene ring is attached to the ketone. Let me imagine the benzene ring as the substituent on the ketone. The ketone is at position 1, so the structure would be (C6H3Br(NO2))(3,5)–C(O)CH3? Or is it (C6H3Br(NO2))(3,5)–C(O)CH2– something? Wait, maybe I should draw it mentally. So the benzene ring has a ketone group attached. The positions 3 and 5 (relative to the point of attachment) have Br and NO2 groups.

Wait, the numbering: if the ketone is attached at position 1, then the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 on the ring. So the benzene ring is connected to the ketone, and at positions 3 and 5 (relative to that point) are Br and NO2 groups.

So the synthesis starts with benzene. We need to add substituents in a way that ends up with the correct substituents in the correct positions.

The substituents we have are: a ketone group (from ethanone), a bromo group, and a nitro group. The positions are 3 and 5 bromo and nitro.

I need to plan the synthesis steps. Let's think about the directing effects of each substituent.

Nitro groups are meta-directing. Bromine is ortho/para (since it's a halogen), but wait, if it's attached as a substituent on the benzene, its directing effect depends on whether it's activating or deactivating. Bromine is deactivating, so it's ortho/para directing. Nitro groups are meta directors.

Now, the problem is about the order of introducing these substituents. Because each substitution directs the next.

Wait, but ethanone is a ketone, which is a meta director. So, if I first introduce, say, the nitro group, then bromine, then the ketone, I have to consider how each step affects the next.

Alternatively, maybe I should introduce the ketone last because it's a strong deactivating group. Wait, but the ketone is an electron-withdrawing group, so it would deactivate the ring. Hmm.

Wait, the target molecule has three substituents: Br at 3, nitro at 5, and the ketone at the attached position (let's call that position 1). So, the benzene ring has substituents at 1,3,5. So it's a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene. Wait, but the target has substituents at 3 and 5 relative to the ketone. So the ketone is at position 1, Br at 3, and nitro at 5.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think of the benzene ring as having the ketone group attached to it (position 1). Then, the substituents (Br and nitro) are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone. So, they are in meta positions relative to each other. So, the substituents are at 3 and 5.

So I need to figure out the order of adding these substituents to benzene so that they end up in the correct positions.

Let me think about possible reaction sequences.

Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts acylation); ii) Br2/FeBr3 (bromination); iii) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration); iv) Fe/HCl (maybe reduction?); v) HNO3/H2SO4; vi) NaNO2/HCl; vii) H3PO2.

Hmm. Let's see. Starting with benzene.

1. Friedel-Crafts acylation would add the ketone group. Benzene would become acetophenone.

But wait, benzene is treated with CH3COCl and AlCl3. So first step is adding the ketone group.

Now, the ring is meta-directing because of the ketone (which is a meta director). So the next substitution (bromination) would happen at meta positions relative to the ketone.

But wait, if after adding the ketone, the next step is bromination. Let's see, acetophenone is a meta director. So bromination (Br2, FeBr3) would add Br at the meta position relative to the ketone.

So after steps i and ii, we have a benzene ring with ketone at position 1 and Br at position 3.

Then step iii is nitration. Since the ring now has the ketone (meta director) and Br (ortho/para, but deactivating). The nitration would be directed by the strongest director. The ketone is a stronger deactivating group than Br, so the nitration would be directed by the ketone. So the nitro group would go into the meta position relative to the ketone, which is position 5, but wait, position 5 relative to the ketone is already occupied by Br. Wait, no, after adding Br at position 3, and the ketone at 1, the meta positions would be 4 and 5. Wait, let me think of the ring positions. If ketone is at position 1, the meta positions are 3 and 5. Oh, but in step ii, Br is added at 3. So in step iii, nitration will be directed to position 5.

So after step iii, we have Br at 3 and nitro at 5, attached to the ketone. So the product would be 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Wait, that's the target. But wait, the options have more steps. So what's next?

Step iv: Fe/HCl. Fe in HCl would be a reducing condition. Maybe Fe/HCl is used for removing nitro groups. Wait, nitro groups can be reduced to amines, but in this case, is that necessary? Because the target has a nitro group, so maybe this step isn't correct. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the steps.

Wait, after the nitration, in step iii, the product is the target. But in the options, the steps continue. So maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence is not correct because after the nitration, other steps might be adding or modifying groups.

Wait, maybe I'm missing that the nitration actually occurs before the bromination. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the order is wrong. Because if I first brominate, then nitrate. Let's think again.

Another approach: perhaps the ketone is introduced last. Because it's a strong deactivating group, and might block certain positions. So if I first add nitro and bromo groups, then add the ketone.

Wait, but how? Because Friedel-Crafts acylation requires the ring to be activated. If the ring already has deactivating groups, the acylation might not occur.

So perhaps the ketone must be introduced early, before the deactivating groups.

Wait, so the first step is acylation: benzene becomes acetophenone (if possible). Then, bromine is added meta to the ketone, then nitration meta to the ketone again. But then, where are the substituents?

Wait, let's try this step by step.

Option B: i) Br2/FeBr3 (bromination of benzene); ii) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration); iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 (acylation); iv) HNO3/H2SO4; etc.

Wait, but if you first brominate benzene, you get bromobenzene. Then nitrating would be directed by bromine, which is ortho/para. So nitration would add nitro at either ortho or para to Br. Then acylation—how? Because Friedel-Crafts requires an activated ring. But nitro is deactivating, which would make the ring less reactive towards electrophilic substitution. Hmm. So perhaps that's not feasible.

So maybe the ketone needs to be introduced early, before any deactivating groups, because Friedel-Crafts requires an activated ring.

So let's consider the correct order. Let me think of the substituents. We need to have a ketone group, a bromo group, and a nitro group on the benzene ring. The ketone is a meta director, so the bromo and nitro groups should be added in positions directed by the ketone.

So the plan is: first, introduce the ketone via acylation (Friedel-Crafts). Then, add bromine in the meta position relative to the ketone. Then, add nitro group in another meta position relative to the ketone.

Wait, but after adding Br and nitro, would they be at 3 and 5 positions? Let me see.

After acylation (step i), we have acetophenone. Then bromination (step ii) would add Br at meta position (position 3). Then, nitration (step iii) would add nitro at position 5, since that's the next meta position.

Wait, does that work? So after steps i, ii, iii, we would have the target molecule. But looking at the options, none of them have only three steps. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the options have seven steps each. So perhaps some steps are for protection or other functional group transformations.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the nitro group is added before the bromine. Let's think: if I first acylate (ketone), then nitrate (nitro group), which would be meta to the ketone, then brominate. But where would the bromine go?

Wait, let's walk through that. Step i: acylation (ketone at 1). Step ii: nitration—nitro group would go meta to ketone, so position 3. Then step iii: bromination. The ring now has ketone (meta) and nitro (meta to ketone, ortho to bromine if added here). Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, in step iii, after acylation and nitration, the substituents are ketone (1) and nitro (3). The nitro group is a strong meta director. So bromination would be directed by the nitro group. Where are the possible positions?

Nitro at 3: bromine would enter at position 1 (already taken by ketone) or position 5 (meta to nitro). So in this case, bromine would add at position 5.

Wait, but in the target molecule, bromine is at 3 and nitro at 5. Wait, no, the target has Br at 3 and nitro at 5, both relative to the ketone.

So if I first acylate (1), then nitrate (3), then brominate (5). But in that case, the bromine is at position 5, which is meta to the ketone (position 1), but ortho to the nitro group at 3.

Wait, but the target has bromine at 3. So that approach would place it at 5, which is not what we want.

Hmm. So perhaps the order is different. Let me think: after acylation, perhaps bromination comes before nitration.

So step i: acylation (position 1). Step ii: bromination adds Br at position 3. Step iii: nitration adds nitro. But where?

At this point, the ring has ketone (1), Br (3). The ketone is a meta director, and Br is ortho/para. Which group is stronger in directing?

The ketone is a stronger deactivating group than Br. So nitration would be directed by the ketone. So nitro would go to position 5, which is meta to the ketone.

So after step iii, we have ketone (1), Br (3), nitro (5). That's exactly the target. So steps i, ii, iii.

But the options have more steps. So perhaps I'm missing some steps that might involve other functional group transformations or protection.

Wait, looking back at the options, let me see option C.

Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2.

Wait, that starts with nitration. So benzene first gets a nitro group. Then Fe/HCl is likely a reduction step, turning nitro to amine. Then acylation—so benzene with an amine group gets an acetyl group via Friedel-Crafts? But amine is a strong activating group, ortho/para director. So after the amine, acylation would add the ketone.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Option C: steps are nitration, Fe/HCl (probably reduces nitro to NH2), then acylation. Hmm, but after nitration, benzene becomes nitrobenzene. Then Fe/HCl would reduce nitro to amino. So then, we have aniline. Then, step iii is acylation: AlCl3 and CH3COCl would perform Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. However, aniline is a strong activating group, so the acylation would occur ortho or para to the amino group. But then, the next step is Br2/FeBr3. So after acylation, the ring has an amine and a ketone group. But wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps after acylation, we have aniline toluene or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the steps are introducing substituents in a way that allows the right positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is introducing the nitro group first, then the bromine, then the ketone.

But wait, I'm not sure. Let's think about all options.

Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl; iii) NaNO2/HCl; iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3; vii) HNO3/H2SO4.

Starting with nitration (step i), benzene becomes nitrobenzene. Step ii: Fe/HCl reduces nitro to amine (NH2). Step iii: NaNO2/HCl (diazotization) would convert the amine to a diazonium salt. Step iv: H3PO2 (which is a mild reducing agent, perhaps for something else). Then step v: bromination. Step vi: acylation. Step vii: nitration again.

Hmm, but I'm not sure how that would place the substituents correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the target requires that the bromine is added before the nitro group. But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of directing effects and the correct positions.

The target is 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl attached to ethanone. So, the substituents are at 3 and 5 relative to the ketone.

So, the ketone (group A) is at position 1, bromine (group B) at position 3, and nitro (group C) at position 5.

To get these positions, we need to introduce the substituents in a way that each directs the next to the correct position.

Suppose we start with benzene. First, introduce group A (ketone). Then, group B (bromine) is introduced, which is meta to group A. Then, group C (nitro) is introduced, which is meta to group A as well. But wait, in that case, group B and group C would be meta to each other, but that's okay.

So the steps would be: acylation (group A), bromination (group B), nitration (group C).

Wait, but the ketone is a meta director. So, when introducing group B, the bromine would go meta to A. Then, group C (nitro) would go meta to A again, but that position is either taken or not.

Wait, if group A is at 1, group B is at 3, then group C (nitro) would go to 5, which is meta to A and not adjacent to B. Because group B is at 3, which is ortho to group C at 5. Wait, no, group B is at 3 and group C is at 5, which are meta to each other. Hmm, that's possible.

So the sequence would be acylation, bromination, nitration.

Looking back at the options, which one follows this order?

Looking at option A:

i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 (acylation)
ii) Br2/FeBr3 (bromination)
iii) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration)
iv) Fe/HCl
v) HNO3/H2SO4
vi) NaNO2/HCl
vii) H3PO2

Wait, after steps i, ii, iii, we have the target. So why continue with steps iv to vii? Because perhaps some of these steps are unnecessary or I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the synthesis requires more steps, maybe some functional group transformations.

Wait, wait. Friedel-Crafts acylation requires benzene to be activated. If after acylation, the ring is deactivated, then further substitution is difficult. So perhaps introducing the bromine and nitro groups before the acylation isn't possible because the ring is deactivated. So the correct order must be acylation first, then bromine, then nitro.

But looking at the options, which option starts with acylation? Option A starts with i) acylation. So steps i, ii, iii would be acylation, bromination, nitration.

So the product after step iii would be 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone, which is the target. But in option A, there are more steps. Steps iv to vii involve Fe/HCl, nitration again, NaNO2, H3PO2. I'm not sure why those would be included. Maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitration is done after bromination, but in a way that the nitro group is added para to the bromine but meta to the ketone. Wait, but that would complicate the positions.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the nitro group is added before the bromine. Let's say, acylation first, then nitration, then bromination. So step i: acylation (position 1). Step ii: nitration. Where? Nitration would be directed by the ketone (meta), so nitro at position 3. Step iii: bromination, directed by the ketone (meta) and the nitro group (meta to nitro is position 1 and 5). So bromine would go to position 5, which is meta to the ketone and para to the nitro. But then the product would have nitro at 3 and Br at 5. But in the target, Br is at 3 and nitro at 5. So that's the reverse.

Hmm.

So perhaps the correct order is acylation, bromination, and then nitration. So option A's first three steps would give the target. But why are there more steps in option A?

Looking at the target, perhaps the nitro group is added after the bromine. Let me check the steps again.

Option A: after steps i, ii, iii, we have the target. So why are there more steps? Maybe the steps iv to vii are for something else. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the target structure.

Wait, perhaps the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the ketone is at position 1, and the substituents are at 3 (Br) and 5 (NO2). So, to achieve this, after acylation, bromination would add Br at 3, then nitration at 5.

So, in option A, steps i,ii,iii give the target. Then steps iv to vii: iv is Fe/HCl, which I think is used for reduction, perhaps of nitro groups. But why would they reduce after adding the nitro group? That would change the substituent.

Wait, perhaps the nitration in step iii isn't correct. Maybe the nitro group is added in a different position.

Alternatively, perhaps the synthesis requires protection of certain groups or involves some elimination steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine is added after the nitro group, but in that case, the nitro group would direct the bromine to a different position.

Alternatively, maybe the nitro group is introduced before the bromine, but then the bromine ends up in the correct position.

Wait, maybe the correct order is acylation, nitration, bromination. Let's think.

Step i: acylation (ketone at 1). Step ii: nitration (nitro at 3). Step iii: bromination (directed by ketone, would go to 5). So the product would have nitro at 3, Br at 5. But the target has Br at 3 and nitro at 5. So that's the opposite.

Hmm. So that approach doesn't work. So that's why the correct order must be acylation, bromination, nitration.

So, in that case, the correct option would be the one that starts with acylation, then bromination, then nitration.

Looking at the options:

Option A: i) acylation; ii) bromination; iii) nitration.

So, after step iii, the product is the target. But in option A, there are steps iv to vii. So why those steps?

Wait, perhaps the nitration in step iii isn't correct because the bromine is a stronger director. Wait, after acylation and bromination, the ring has ketone (meta) and Br (ortho/para). So when nitrating, which group directs?

The ketone is a stronger deactivating group than Br. So the nitro would go into the position meta to the ketone, which is position 5, since position 3 is already occupied by Br.

So after steps i, ii, iii, the product is correct.

But why does option A have more steps? Maybe the question is about high-yield synthesis, and the steps involve more than just substitution.

Wait, maybe the steps after iii are for something else. Step iv is Fe/HCl. Maybe that's for reducing something, but after nitration, what would that do? Or perhaps it's a typo, and the steps are not in order. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitration in step iii is done under certain conditions that don't add the nitro group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Let me think about option C.

Option C: steps are nitration, Fe/HCl (reduction), acylation, bromination, nitration, diazotization, H3PO2.

Wait, starting with benzene, step i: nitration gives nitrobenzene. Step ii: Fe/HCl (probably reduction) converts nitro to amine. So now we have aniline. Step iii: acylation (Friedel-Crafts) would add the ketone in the presence of the amine group. But amine is a strong activating group, so the acylation would occur ortho/para to the amine.

Wait, but the ketone is a meta director, but when added after an activating group, the position would be directed by the amine.

So, if we have aniline (NH2 at position 1), then acylation would add the ketone at position 3 or 5 (ortho or para to NH2). Wait, no, NH2 is a strong activating group, so in Friedel-Crafts acylation, the ketone would enter at para position relative to NH2.

So after step iii, the structure would be 4-acetophenylamine? Or not? Wait, no, because the acylation would happen at position 4 relative to the NH2 group.

But in any case, after that, the next step is bromination (step iv: Br2/FeBr3). The ring now has NH2 (position 1), ketone (position 4), and bromine would be directed by the strongest director, which is the ketone? Or the NH2?

Wait, NH2 is a strong activating group, so it's a strong director. So bromine would enter ortho or para to NH2. But in this case, the NH2 is at position 1, and the ketone is at position 4 (para to NH2).

So, bromination would add at position 2 (ortho to NH2) or position 4 (but that's already taken by the ketone), so position 6 (another para, but that's not adjacent). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the ring now has NH2 at 1, ketone at 4. So the possible positions for bromine are 2, 3, 5, 6.

But since the NH2 is a strong director, bromine would go ortho or para. So position 2 or 6 (ortho) or position 4 (para, but already taken). So maybe position 2 or 6. But then, after bromination, step v is another nitration. Not sure.

This seems complicated. Maybe option C isn't the correct one.

Looking back, perhaps option D is correct. Let me think.

Option D: i) nitration; ii) Fe/HCl; iii) NaNO2/HCl; iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3; vi) acylation; vii) nitration.

Wait, this seems a bit odd. Starting with nitration, then reduction to amine, then diazotization, then H3PO2 (which is a reducing agent, but for what?), then bromination, acylation, then nitration again.

I'm not sure. It's getting too complicated.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option C.

Wait, another approach: the positions of substituents are 3 and 5 relative to the ketone. So, if I have the ketone at position 1, then substituents are at 3 and 5. That's a meta and para positions relative to each other.

Wait, but in any case, perhaps the correct sequence is to first acylate, then brominate (meta to ketone), then nitrate (meta to ketone, but that position is available because bromine is at 3). So the nitro goes at 5.

So the correct steps are acylation, bromination, nitration.

Looking at the options, option A has these first three steps. So why does it have more steps? Perhaps option A is the correct one, but the additional steps are a distractor.

Wait, but why would the sequence require more steps? Maybe the actual reaction requires more steps, but the correct order is present in the correct option.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option C. Let me think again.

Option C: i) nitration; ii) Fe/HCl (reduce nitro to amine); iii) acylation; iv) bromination; v) nitration; vi) diazotization; vii) H3PO2.

Wait, after step iii, we have aniline with a ketone group. Then bromination would happen, but where? The ring has an amine group (strong director) and a ketone. So bromine would go ortho or para to the amine. Let's say ketone is at position 4 relative to amine (position 1). So bromine would go to position 2 or 6 (ortho), or position 4 (para, but taken by ketone). Then step v is nitration, which would be directed by the strongest group, which is the amine. So nitration would likely go ortho or para to the amine. But I'm not sure how that would lead to the correct substituents.

This is getting a bit too involved. Maybe I should consider looking for the correct option based on the initial steps.

So, the correct order is acylation, bromination, nitration. Which is the first three steps of option A. So the correct option is A.

But in option A, after step iii, the product is correct, but the remaining steps are unclear. Wait, perhaps I'm missing that the nitration in step iii is not the correct position.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the nitration occurs before the bromination, but in a way that the nitro group is added at position 5, then the bromine at 3. But for that to happen, the nitro group must be a meta director, so after acylation, nitration would add nitro at 3, then bromine would go to 5. Or no, wait.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think of the options again.

Looking at option B:

i) Br2/FeBr3; ii) HNO3/H2SO4; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3; iv) HNO3/H2SO4; etc.

So first, bromination: benzene becomes bromobenzene. Then nitration: nitro group would go ortho or para to Br. Let's say ortho: position 2, or para: position 4. Then acylation: would the ring be reactive enough? Because Br is deactivating, but perhaps possible. So after acylation, the ring has Br (1), nitro (3), and ketone (4). Hmm, but that doesn't fit the target.

Alternatively, after step i, bromine at 1. Step ii, nitration adds nitro at 3. Step iii, acylation adds ketone at 5. So positions 1 (Br), 3 (nitro), 5 (ketone). Wait, but that's opposite of what we need.

The target has ketone at 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5. So that's not matching.

Hmm.

So, the correct sequence must be acylation first, then bromination, then nitration. So the first three steps of option A. So option A is the correct one.


To synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene, the key is to introduce the substituents in the correct order, considering the directing effects of each group. The target molecule has a ketone group at position 1, a bromine atom at position 3, and a nitro group at position 5 relative to the ketone. The ketone is a meta-directing group, while bromine and nitro groups are ortho/para-directing and meta-directing, respectively.

### Analysis of the Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **Step i**: Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the ketone group at position 1. The benzene ring becomes acetophenone.
2. **Step ii**: Bromination with Br₂/FeBr₃ adds bromine at position 3, meta to the ketone.
3. **Step iii**: Nitration with HNO₃/H₂SO₄ adds the nitro group at position 5, meta to the ketone.
4. **Steps iv–vii**: These steps appear unnecessary for achieving the target molecule, as the product is already formed after step iii.

This sequence correctly places the substituents in the desired positions.

#### **Option B**:
1. **Step i**: Bromination adds bromine to benzene, forming bromobenzene.
2. **Step ii**: Nitration adds a nitro group ortho or para to bromine, which does not align with the target structure.
3. **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the ketone, but the positions of bromine and nitro would already be incorrect.

This sequence does not yield the target molecule.

#### **Option C**:
1. **Step i**: Nitration adds a nitro group to benzene, forming nitrobenzene.
2. **Step ii**: Reduction with Fe/HCl converts the nitro group to an amine.
3. **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the ketone, but the amine group would strongly direct substitution, making it difficult to achieve the correct positions.
4. **Steps iv–vii**: Subsequent bromination and nitration steps do not align with the target structure.

This sequence does not yield the target molecule.

#### **Option D**:
1. **Step i**: Nitration adds a nitro group to benzene.
2. **Step ii**: Reduction with Fe/HCl converts the nitro group to an amine.
3. **Step iii**: Diazotization with NaNO₂/HCl and reduction with H₃PO₂ do not contribute to the desired substitution pattern.
4. **Step iv**: Bromination adds bromine, but the positions remain incorrect.
5. **Step v**: Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the ketone, but the substituents are already misplaced.

This sequence does not yield the target molecule.

### Conclusion:
The correct sequence is **Option A**, as it introduces the ketone first, followed by bromine and nitro groups in the correct meta positions. The additional steps in Option A are unnecessary but do not interfere with the formation of the target molecule.

**Answer: A**
