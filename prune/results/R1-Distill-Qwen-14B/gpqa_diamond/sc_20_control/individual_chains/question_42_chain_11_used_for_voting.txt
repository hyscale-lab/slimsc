Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the question is about exoplanets and their orbital periods. I remember that Kepler's third law has something to do with the orbital period and the distance from the star. Oh right, the law states that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of the orbit. But wait, there's also the equilibrium temperature to consider here.

The problem says the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3 is about 2.3. So T1/T2 is 1.4, and T2/T3 is 2.3. So I think I can find the ratios of their temperatures step by step.

Wait, equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star, right? The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * (L_star / (16 * π * σ * D^2))^0.5, but wait, I think it can also be written as T_planet = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2D)) ), but maybe I'm mixing up some formulas here. Alternatively, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance from the star, assuming similar albedos and other factors. Oh, the problem says albedo is the same for all, so that's good.

So the equilibrium temperature T is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance D. So T ∝ 1/√D.

So if I have T1/T2 = 1.4, then (1/√D1)/(1/√D2) )= 1.4 → sqrt(D2/D1) = 1.4 → D2/D1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So D2 is 1.96 times D1.

Similarly, T2/T3 is 2.3 → T2 = 2.3 * T3. So since T is inversely proportional to sqrt(D), then sqrt(D3/D2) = 2.3 → D3/D2 = (2.3)^2 = ~5.29.

So D3 is about 5.29 times D2. So D3 = 5.29 * D2, and D2 is 1.96 * D1. So D3 = 5.29 * 1.96 * D1. Let me compute that.

5.29 * 1.96: 5 * 1.96 is 9.8, and 0.29 * 1.96 is about 0.57. So total around 10.37. So D3 ≈ 10.37 * D1.

Wait, but the orbital period depends on the distance cubed over the square of the mass or something. Oh, Kepler's third law in the form P² = (4π²/G(M+m)) * a³. But for planets around a star much more massive than the planet, M is the star's mass and m is negligible. So P² ∝ a³ / M. But if the star's mass is the same for all three planets, then P² ∝ a³.

Wait, but in this case, all planets are orbiting the same star, right? So the star's mass is the same for all three. So the period squared is proportional to the semi-major axis cubed.

So the ratio of periods would be (a3/a1)^(3/2). Wait, wait—no, wait: P² ∝ a³ → P ∝ a^(3/2). So P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2).

But wait, a is the semi-major axis, which is the distance D. So a3 is D3, and a1 is D1. So D3 is 10.37 * D1. So (10.37)^(3/2) ≈ ?

Let me calculate 10.37^(1.5). Hmm, 10^1.5 is 31.62. 10.37 is a bit more than 10, so let's approximate.

Wait, 10.37 is about 10 * 1.037. So sqrt(10.37) is sqrt(10)*sqrt(1.037) ≈ 3.1623 * 1.018 ≈ 3.219. Then 10.37^(1.5) is 10.37 * sqrt(10.37) ≈ 10.37 * 3.219 ≈ let's see: 10 * 3.219 = 32.19, and 0.37*3.219 ≈ 1.19. So total is about 33.38.

Wait, so if D3 is ~10.37 times D1, then P3/P1 is (10.37)^(3/2) ≈ 33.38. So about 33.4 times. Looking at the options, option D is ~33.4.

Wait, but wait. Are the distances directly related to the equilibrium temperatures in that way? Let me double-check. The equilibrium temperature T is given by T = (L/(16πσ D²))^0.5, but actually, the exact formula incorporates the star's luminosity. So perhaps more accurately, T ∝ 1/sqrt(D) because L is the same for all planets if they're around the same star.

So yeah, T is inversely proportional to sqrt(D). So the earlier calculation should hold.

But let me make sure about the steps. So T1/T2 = 1.4 → T1 = 1.4 T2. Since T ∝ 1/√D, then T1 / T2 = sqrt(D2/D1) → 1.4 = sqrt(D2/D1) → D2 = D1 * (1.4)^2 → 1.96 D1.

Similarly, T2 / T3 = 2.3 → T3 = T2 / 2.3. So T2 / T3 = sqrt(D3/D2) → 2.3 = sqrt(D3/D2) → D3 = D2 * (2.3)^2 ≈ 5.29 D2.

So D3 = 5.29 * D2 = 5.29 * 1.96 D1 ≈ 10.37 D1.

Then, Kepler's law: P² ∝ D³ → P ∝ D^(3/2). So P3/P1 = (D3/D1)^(3/2) = (10.37)^(3/2) ≈ 33.4.

So the factor is ~33.4, which is option D.

To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we use the relationships between equilibrium temperature, distance from the star, and orbital period.

### Step 1: Relating Equilibrium Temperature to Distance
The equilibrium temperature \( T \) of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its distance from the star (\( T \propto 1/\sqrt{D} \)). Given the temperature ratios:
- \( T_1/T_2 = 1.4 \), we find \( \sqrt{D_2/D_1} = 1.4 \), so \( D_2/D_1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96 \).
- \( T_2/T_3 = 2.3 \), we find \( \sqrt{D_3/D_2} = 2.3 \), so \( D_3/D_2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29 \).

Thus, \( D_3 = 5.29 \cdot D_2 \), and substituting \( D_2 = 1.96 \cdot D_1 \), we get:
\[
D_3 = 5.29 \cdot 1.96 \cdot D_1 \approx 10.37 \cdot D_1.
\]

### Step 2: Relating Orbital Period to Distance
Kepler's third law states that the orbital period squared is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (distance from the star): \( P^2 \propto D^3 \). Therefore, the ratio of periods is:
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left(\frac{D_3}{D_1}\right)^{3/2}.
\]
Substituting \( D_3/D_1 = 10.37 \), we calculate:
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.37)^{3/2}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculating \( (10.37)^{3/2} \)
First, \( \sqrt{10.37} \approx 3.219 \). Then:
\[
(10.37)^{3/2} = 10.37 \cdot 3.219 \approx 33.4.
\]

### Conclusion
The orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1. Comparing this result to the options, the correct answer is:

5.29 * 1.96: 5 * 1.96 is 9.8, and 0.29 * 1.96 is about 0.57. So total around 10.37. So D3 ≈ 10.37 * D1.

Wait, so if D3 is ~10.37 times D1, then P3/P1 is (10.37)^(3/2) ≈ 33.38. So about 33.4 times. Looking at the options, option D is ~33.4.

Similarly, T2 / T3 = 2.3 → T3 = T2 / 2.3. So T2 / T3 = sqrt(D3/D2) → 2.3 = sqrt(D3/D2) → D3 = D2 * (2.3)^2 ≈ 5.29 D2.

So D3 = 5.29 * D2 = 5.29 * 1.96 D1 ≈ 10.37 D1.

Then, Kepler's law: P² ∝ D³ → P ∝ D^(3/2). So P3/P1 = (D3/D1)^(3/2) = (10.37)^(3/2) ≈ 33.4.

So the factor is ~33.4, which is option D.


To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we use the relationships between equilibrium temperature, distance from the star, and orbital period.

### Step 1: Relating Equilibrium Temperature to Distance
The equilibrium temperature \( T \) of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its distance from the star (\( T \propto 1/\sqrt{D} \)). Given the temperature ratios:
- \( T_1/T_2 = 1.4 \), we find \( \sqrt{D_2/D_1} = 1.4 \), so \( D_2/D_1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96 \).
- \( T_2/T_3 = 2.3 \), we find \( \sqrt{D_3/D_2} = 2.3 \), so \( D_3/D_2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29 \).

Thus, \( D_3 = 5.29 \cdot D_2 \), and substituting \( D_2 = 1.96 \cdot D_1 \), we get:
\[
D_3 = 5.29 \cdot 1.96 \cdot D_1 \approx 10.37 \cdot D_1.
\]

### Step 2: Relating Orbital Period to Distance
Kepler's third law states that the orbital period squared is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (distance from the star): \( P^2 \propto D^3 \). Therefore, the ratio of periods is:
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left(\frac{D_3}{D_1}\right)^{3/2}.
\]
Substituting \( D_3/D_1 = 10.37 \), we calculate:
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.37)^{3/2}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculating \( (10.37)^{3/2} \)
First, \( \sqrt{10.37} \approx 3.219 \). Then:
\[
(10.37)^{3/2} = 10.37 \cdot 3.219 \approx 33.4.
\]

### Conclusion
The orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1. Comparing this result to the options, the correct answer is:
