Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed from a specific reaction. Hmm, I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency is related to the number of rings and double bonds in a molecule. Each ring or double bond contributes one to the index. So, I think I'll need to find out what the product looks like after the reaction and then count those.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let me draw that structure mentally. So, a cyclohexene ring. The numbering: position 2 has a formyl group (CHO), position 3 is the double bond (since it's cyclohex-3-ene), and position 5 has a vinyl group (CH2CH2? Wait, no. Vinyl is CH2-CH, but as a substituent. So, the vinyl group is attached at position 5 as CH2CH2? Wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH- as a substituent. So, the cyclohexene has a double bond between carbons 3 and 4, maybe? Or wait, cyclohex-3-ene would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4. So the ring has a double bond, and at position 5, there's a vinyl group (another double bond, since vinyl is CH2=CH-).

So the starting molecule has a cyclohexene ring with a double bond, a formyl group at position 2, and a vinyl group at position 5. So that's two double bonds so far: the cyclohexene's and the vinyl's. Plus, the formyl group is a carbonyl, which is a double bond, but that's part of the substituent. So the molecule has three double bonds in total? Wait, no. Wait, the formyl group is a CHO, which is a carbonyl (C=O), so that's a double bond as well. So the starting molecule has three double bonds?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The cyclohexene has one double bond (ring double bond). The vinyl group is a substituent with a double bond. And the formyl group is another double bond (C=O). So that's three double bonds. So each of these contributes to the index of hydrogen deficiency. So the index is 3. Well, the product is after reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI.

Wait, what's the reaction here? Red phosphorus and HI... Oh, right! I remember that red phosphorus is used in the hydrohalogenation of carbonyl groups. The reaction is called the Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen reduction reduces ketones (carbonyl groups) to CH2 groups using H2O and red phosphorus. Wait, no, wait. Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl, but wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Oh wait, another reaction: when you have a carbonyl and you treat it with HI and red phosphorus, that's the Wolff-Kishner reaction, which removes the carbonyl group. Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing with the use of LiAlH4 or other reducing agents.

Wait, another thought: when you have alkenes and you treat with HI, it can cause addition reactions. But in this case, the reagent is red phosphorus and excess HI. Oh, wait! That's another reaction. Red phosphorus in HI is used for the deoxygenation of alcohols, perhaps? Or maybe for the elimination of oxygen from carbonyl groups. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, maybe the reaction is the Prins reaction or some other addition. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the elimination of a carbonyl group. Let me think: red phosphorus plus HI. Oh, wait, I think when a carbonyl group is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it leads to the formation of a CH2 group. For example, in the reduction of ketones. So the formyl group (CHO) would be reduced. So the formyl (CHO) group would become CH2OH? Or wait, no, maybe it's a full reduction. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a halogenation.

Wait, another approach: What is the structure of the starting material. 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So cyclohexene (double bond at 3), formyl at 2, vinyl at 5, and a carboxylic acid group (COOH) somewhere. Wait, wait, the name is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the carboxylic acid is at position something. Wait, cyclohexene is the base, so the substituents are at positions 2 (formyl), 3 (double bond), and 5 (vinyl). Wait, no, the carboxylic acid is part of the cyclohexene's substituents. Wait, the name is "cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid". So the carboxylic acid is attached to the cyclohexene ring at position 1? Because cyclohexenecarboxylic acid implies that the COOH is at the end of the chain.

Wait, maybe the structure is a cyclohexene ring with a substituent at position 1 being the COOH group, position 2 the formyl group, and position 5 the vinyl group. So the ring is numbered such that the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4, the COOH is at position 1, formyl at position 2, and vinyl at position 5.

So the starting molecule has three double bonds: the cyclohexene's double bond, the vinyl group's double bond, and the formyl group's carbonyl. So index of hydrogen deficiency is 3.

Now, the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. I think this is the reaction where a carbonyl group is converted into CH2. Wait, Clemmensen reduction uses Zn(Hg)/HCl, but another reaction, maybe the Arndt-Eistert reaction? Or perhaps it's the deoxygenation of a ketone.

Wait, another thought: Red phosphorus in HI is used to remove oxygen from alcohols. For example, an alcohol may lose an OH group and gain two H I groups. Wait, but in this case, the starting material has a formyl group (CHO), not an alcohol.

Wait, maybe the reaction is the hydrolysis of a carbonyl group. No, in the presence of HI, perhaps it's a more specific reaction. Alternatively, maybe the formyl group is reduced to a CH2 group.

Wait, if the formyl group (CHO) is reduced to CH2OH, but that's in a different reaction. Alternatively, in the presence of HI and red phosphorus, perhaps the formyl group is converted to CH2I. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the formyl group undergoes a reaction where the C=O is replaced by a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the formyl group to a methylene (-CH2-) group. So the product would have a CH2 group where the CHO was.

But wait, another possibility: the reaction could be adding HI across the double bonds. Since the starting material has two double bonds (the cyclohexene and the vinyl group), and excess HI is present. But wait, red phosphorus is also present. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the opening of the epoxide, but the starting material doesn't have an epoxide.

Wait, another approach: the reaction of a carbonyl group with red phosphorus and HI. I think I read somewhere that this reaction converts ketones or aldehydes into alkanes. For example, in the presence of excess HI and red phosphorus, a ketone (RCOR') would be converted to RCH2R'. So the formyl group (CHO) would become CH2I. Wait, no, maybe that's not right.

Wait, perhaps the formyl group is being converted into a methyl group. Let's think. The formyl group is RCHO. If treated with red phosphorus and HI, maybe it's reduced to RCH2- something. Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic addition. Wait, but red phosphorus is a reducing agent.

Wait, another thought: The Clemmensen reduction reduces ketones to alkanes. So RCO-R' becomes RCH2-R' when treated with Zn(Hg)/HCl. But the question uses red phosphorus and HI. Is that the same reaction?

Wait, red phosphorus and HI are used in another reaction. For example, the dehydrohalogenation step? Or perhaps the elimination of a carbonyl group.

Wait, I think I remember that when a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde) is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it undergoes a reaction where the oxygen is replaced by a hydrogen and iodine. So the carbonyl group (C=O) becomes CH2 group. So, the formyl group (CHO) would become CH2I. Wait, but in the case of an aldehyde, would it become CH2I? Or maybe it's a substitution of the carbonyl oxygen by iodide.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the carbonyl group to the corresponding CH2 group. So the formyl (CHO) becomes CH2OH? No, but that's in a different reaction. Wait, maybe in this case, the formyl group is converted into CH2I.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible product and its structure.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the carboxylic acid is at position 1, formyl at 2, cyclohexene double bond (between 3 and 4), and vinyl at 5. So, the structure has a six-membered ring with substituents as follows:

- Position 1: COOH
- Position 2: CHO (formyl)
- Position 5: CH2CH2? Wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH-, so attached at position 5 as -CH2-CH2? No, no, the vinyl group is -CH2CH2. Hmm, wait, no. Vinyl is -CH2-CH2? No, wait, vinyl is -CH2-CH2 with a double bond. Oh wait, no, vinyl is actually CH2=CH- as a substituent. So the substituent at position 5 is CH2-CH2, but that can't be. Wait, no, the vinyl group is CH2=CH-, so when attached to the ring, it's -CH2-CH2- with a double bond. So the substituent is -CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So the substituent is -CH2-CH2 but with a double bond in the substituent, making it a vinyl group.

So, the starting molecule has the cyclohexene ring (with one double bond), a vinyl substituent (another double bond), and the formyl group (another double bond). So total double bonds: three.

Now, reacting this with red phosphorus and excess HI. I think the reaction will affect the carbonyl group (formyl) and maybe the other double bonds.

Wait, perhaps the formyl group is being reduced. So the CHO becomes CH2OH or CH2I. Alternatively, perhaps the red phosphorus and HI are causing elimination reactions.

Wait, another possibility: red phosphorus and HI can cause the opening of epoxides, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, the reaction could be a diels-alder type addition, but I don't think so.

Wait, maybe the reaction is the hydrohalogenation of the double bonds. But with excess HI and red phosphorus, perhaps it's adding HI across all the double bonds.

Wait, the starting molecule has two double bonds in the ring (the cyclohexene and the vinyl substituent) and the formyl carbonyl. So three double bonds in total.

If we add HI across each double bond, that would saturate them. So each double bond would become a single bond with HI added. But wait, the formyl group is a carbonyl. Adding HI across that would require something else.

Wait, perhaps the formyl group is being converted into a CH2 group. So the CHO becomes CH2I? Or maybe CH2OH? Or CH2 something else.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a deoxygenation. So the formyl group is removed, and replaced with a CH2 group. So the product would have a cyclohexane ring (no double bonds) because all double bonds are saturated, and the substituents would be CH2 groups.

Wait, but how?

Let me think again. The starting molecule: cyclohexene (1 double bond), vinyl substituent (another, so 2), formyl substituent (another, so 3). So the index of hydrogen deficiency is 3.

If the reaction converts all the double bonds into single bonds, then the product would have no double bonds, so index 0.

Wait, but the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. So, perhaps the cyclohexene and the vinyl group's double bonds are saturated by adding HI, and the formyl group is reduced.

But wait, another approach: the reaction converts each double bond into a single bond and adds HI. So each of the three double bonds would be hydrogenated, converting each into single bonds and adding H and I atoms.

So, the product would be a cyclohexane ring (no double bonds), with substituents: at position 2, a CH2 group (from CHO reduction), at position 5, a CH2CH2I group? Wait, no, that doesn't sound right.

Wait, but maybe each double bond is saturated. The cyclohexene ring's double bond would become single, the vinyl group's double bond would become single, and the formyl group's carbonyl would be reduced to a CH2.

So, the product would have:

- A cyclohexane ring (no double bonds)
- At position 2: a CH2 group (originally CHO)
- At position 5: a CH2CH2 group (originally CH2=CH-), but that's not possible because CH2CH2 is just a single bond, so it becomes -CH2CH2I? No, maybe it's just CH2CH3. Wait, no, because adding HI across the vinyl group would add H and I.

Wait, maybe the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) would react with HI in an addition reaction, leading to CH2-CH2I. But wait, that's not a possibility because HI would add across the double bond, so each end would get an H and I, making CH2-I-CH2-I? No, that can't be right. Wait, no, when you add HI to a double bond, you get a diiodide.

Wait, each addition of HI to a double bond would add H and I to each carbon. So, for the vinyl group, which is CH2=CH-, adding HI would make CH2I-CH2I? No, that's not correct. Because the double bond is CH2-CH2, so adding HI would lead to CH2I-CH2H? No, wait, the mechanism for addition of HI to a double bond is that the HI adds across the double bond in a stepwise manner, with the H adding to one carbon and I to the other. So for the vinyl group, CH2=CH2 (if it were ethylene), adding HI would become CH2I-CH3? No, wait, no, it's more like CH3CH2I? No, wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no. For a simple alkene like ethylene (CH2=CH2), adding HI would result in CH2I-CH3? No, wait, no, when HX adds to an alkene, it's a protonation followed by attack. So for CH2=CH2 + HI → CH2I-CH3? No, I think the product would be CH2I-CH2I, but that doesn't seem right. Or perhaps CH3-CH2I? No, that's not correct either.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the overall effect. The starting material has three double bonds. The reaction probably reduces all of them. So, the product would have all single bonds, which means the index of hydrogen deficiency is 0.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the product would have to lose all the double bonds. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction only affects the carbonyl group.

Wait, but the question says the product's index of hydrogen deficiency. So, if all the double bonds are reduced, the index would be 0.

So, which option is that? The options are:

A)1
B)3
C)5
D)0

So, if the index is 0, the correct answer would be D.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. The starting material's index is 3. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI: what happens?

Red phosphorus in HI is a deoxygenation agent. It can remove oxygen from carbonyl groups. So, the formyl group (CHO) would be converted into CH2I. Similarly, the cyclohexene and vinyl groups would have their double bonds saturated.

So, the product would be a cyclohexane ring, with substituents at position 2 as CH2I and at position 5 as CH2I (since the vinyl group was CH2=CH- and after addition of HI becomes CH2I-CH2I? Or maybe CH2-CH2I? I'm not entirely sure about that substitution, but the main point is that all three double bonds are gone.

So, the product has no rings (since the cyclohexene became cyclohexane) and no double bonds. So, the index of hydrogen deficiency is 0.

Therefore, the correct answer is D)0.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The index of hydrogen deficiency of a molecule is determined by the number of rings and double bonds it contains, as each contributes one to the index. The starting material, 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, has three double bonds: one in the cyclohexene ring, one in the vinyl substituent, and one in the formyl group (C=O). Thus, the initial index of hydrogen deficiency is 3.

When this compound reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI, the reaction reduces the formyl group (C=O) to a CH2 group and saturates the double bonds in the cyclohexene ring and the vinyl substituent. This results in a fully saturated molecule with no double bonds or rings. Therefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 0.

The correct answer is:

Answer: D
