Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's try to work through this step by step.

The question says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. And we need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just subtracting the speeds like in classical mechanics, right? Oh right, because of the velocity addition formula. So the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²). But wait, since both are moving in the same direction, I think that's correct. So for the relative speed, I should plug in v1 as 0.6c and v2 as 0.5c.

Let me calculate that. So, (0.6c - 0.5c) divided by (1 - (0.6*0.5)c²/c²). The numerator is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - 0.3, which is 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 equals approximately 0.1428c. Hmm, the options have 0.14c, which is close, so maybe option C or D for relative speed.

Now, the total energy part. Wait, each astronaut has their own energy, and since they're moving, I think we have to calculate their relativistic energies and add them up. The relativistic energy formula is E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So for the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):
Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2)
0.6 squared is 0.36, so 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64) is 0.8. So gamma1 is 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):
Gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2)
0.5 squared is 0.25. 1 -0.25 = 0.75. sqrt(0.75) is about 0.8660, so 1/0.8660 is approximately 1.1547.

E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Wait, but I should be precise. Let me compute sqrt(0.75) more accurately. 0.75 is 3/4. So sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.8660254. So gamma2 is 2/sqrt(3) ≈ 1.1547005.

So E2 = 3m * (2/sqrt(3)) * c². Let me compute that: 3 * 2 is 6, divided by sqrt(3) is about 3.464 m c². Oh wait, that's E2.

So the total energy E = E1 + E2 = 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and option D says 5mc². So C's energy matches.

Wait, but let me check the calculations again.

Gamma1: 0.6c. 0.6^2=0.36. 1-0.36=0.64. sqrt(0.64)=0.8. So gamma1 is 1.25. E1=2m * 1.25 * c² =2.5 m c². Correct.

Gamma2: 0.5c. 0.5^2=0.25. 1-0.25=0.75. sqrt(0.75)=sqrt(3)/2≈0.8660. Gamma2 is 1/(sqrt(0.75))=sqrt(4/3)≈1.1547. So E2=3m *1.1547 c² =3 *1.1547=3.4641 m c².

Adding E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.4641 =5.9641 m c², which is approximately 5.96 mc².

So the total energy is around 5.96 mc². So looking at the options, option C is v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc². That matches.

Wait, but the relative speed we calculated was approximately 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So option C and D have 0.14c. So the correct options are C and the others are wrong.

Wait, but wait, what about the rest energy? Do we include that in the system's energy? Hmm, the system's total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. So yes, I think that's correct.

So the correct answer must be option C where v_rel is 0.14c and E is 5.96 mc².

To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction at relativistic speeds is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1428c
\]

This rounds to \(v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c\).

### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the first astronaut:
- Mass = \(2m\), speed = \(0.6c\)
- \(\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25\)
- Energy: \(E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2\)

#### For the second astronaut:
- Mass = \(3m\), speed = \(0.5c\)
- \(\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}/2} \approx 1.1547\)
- Energy: \(E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2\)

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]

This rounds to \(E_{\text{total}} \approx 5.96m c^2\).

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \(v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c\), and the total energy is \(E \approx 5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96m c^2\)**
