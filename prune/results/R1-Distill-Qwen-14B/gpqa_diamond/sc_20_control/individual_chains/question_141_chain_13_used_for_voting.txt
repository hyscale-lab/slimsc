Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in a condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, I need to determine how many possible organic products are formed.

Wait, wait. 1-bromobenzene-2-d... Oh, wait, that's a bit confusing. Wait, benzene has only six carbons. So 1-bromobenzene would imply a bromine attached to the benzene ring at position 1, but the numbering seems off. Or maybe it's a typo. Oh, wait, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene? Because sometimes "d" could denote a substituent. Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe it's 2-bromo-1-dimethylaminobenzene? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait the compound is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Oh, maybe the "d" stands for a substituent, like dimethylamino? So perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene. Because in some notations, the substituents are indicated with letters, like "d" for dimethylamino. So benzene with Br at position 1 and a dimethylamino group at position 2.

So the structure would be benzene ring with Br in position 1 and (CH3)2NH group in position 2. So adjacent substituents. Or wait, position 1 and position 2 are adjacent. Oh, wait, benzene is a ring, so positions 1 and 2 are adjacent. So Br and (CH3)2NH are next to each other.

Now, the reaction is with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. What's that reaction condition usually for? I remember that NaNH2 in ammonia is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions. Also, for elimination reactions or for dehydrohalogenation, like forming alkenes from haloalkanes. Or perhaps it's used for aromatic substitution, like when activating or deactivating the ring.

Wait, but in this case, the benzene ring already has substituents. Let me think about the possible mechanisms. The substituent in benzene directs incoming electrophiles. But wait, if we're using a strong base like NaNH2, perhaps we're dealing with a nucleophilic aromatic substitution or elimination.

Wait, but benzene isn't typically susceptible to nucleophilic substitution unless there's a strong activating group. The substituents here are Br and (CH3)2NH. The (CH3)2NH group is a strong activating group (since it's a strong electron donating group, being a tertiary amine), which would activate the ring towards electrophilic substitution. But wait, the Br is an electron-withdrawing group (since it's a meta director), but when attached, it deactivates the ring.

But wait, this might not be an electrophilic substitution. Let me think about another possibility. Maybe it's a substitution where the Br is leaving. So perhaps the base abstracts a proton, leading to an elimination or a substitution.

Wait, when a bromide is present on a benzene ring, under strong basic conditions, could it undergo a substitution? Alternatively, perhaps the amine group is involved.

Alternatively, maybe this is a case of aromatic ring formation via elimination. Wait, the (CH3)2NH group is a good leaving group? No, wait, it's a strong base, but in this case, perhaps it's a nucleophilic attack.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the (CH3)2NH group is deprotonated. Wait, but (CH3)2NH is a weak base compared to, say, NH2-? Hmm, but NaNH2 is a strong base. Wait, perhaps the amine group could act as a leaving group, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, another approach: what's the structure of 1-bromobenzene-2-d? Oh, wait, maybe the "d" is a typo and it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene. So the substituents are at positions 1 and 2.

In this case, the ring has two substituents: Br and (CH3)2NH. How do these groups influence the reactivity of the ring?

The (CH3)2NH group is a strong activating group, making the ring more reactive towards electrophilic substitution. But since it's a meta director, but wait, no, wait: (CH3)2NH is a strong activating group and ortho/para director. But wait, in reality, dimethylamino is a strong activating, ortho/para-directing group.

So in this molecule, the Br is in position 1, and the dimethylamino is in position 2. So the positions are adjacent. So in the benzene ring, positions 1 and 2 are next to each other.

Now, when treated with a strong base like NaNH2 in ammonia, what happens? Let me think about the possible reactions.

Wait, another possibility is that the Br is displaced. But in aromatic substitution, the leaving group (like Br-) would typically require a good activating group to facilitate the substitution. Since the dimethylamino group is activating, perhaps the ring is activated enough that the Br could be replaced via some mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton adjacent to Br, leading to an elimination. Wait, but in aromatic systems, elimination is more about forming a double bond, but benzene is already aromatic.

Wait, maybe it's a case of aromatic nucleophilic substitution. But for that, the ring needs to be activated towards nucleophilic attack, which usually requires strong electron-withdrawing groups. The Br is an EWG, but perhaps not enough on its own.

Wait, but in the presence of a strong base, maybe the ring becomes deprotonated, making it more nucleophilic. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction involves the dimethylamino group. Since (CH3)2NH is a good leaving group? Wait, no, I don't think so. It's a strong base, so maybe it can't leave.

Wait, perhaps the base induces a dehydrohalogenation, but that's more for aliphatic systems. For benzene rings, maybe it's a different process.

Wait, another thought: maybe this is a case of ipso substitution. Like, the Br leaves, and another group comes in. But what would come in? The ring is activated by the dimethylamino group, so perhaps an amine group could attack.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the conditions again. NaNH2 in ammonia is often used as a strong base, and in some cases, for elimination reactions. For example, in the formation of alkenes from alkyl halides.

Wait, but here we have a benzene ring with substituents. Maybe the reaction is not on the ring but on another part of the molecule. Wait, but the given molecule is 1-bromobenzene-2-d, which I'm taking as 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene.

Wait, perhaps the dimethylamino group is adjacent to the Br, and the base could abstract a proton beta to the Br, leading to elimination of HBr. But wait, how would that work on a benzene ring? Because the ring is already conjugated.

Ah, wait, perhaps the ring undergoes some kind of elimination, but I'm not very familiar with that. Alternatively, maybe the Br is replaced by an amine group.

Wait, NaNH2 in ammonia would provide NH2- ions. So perhaps the NH2- acts as a nucleophile, substituting the Br.

But substitution on an aromatic ring is tricky because aromatic rings are generally not good at nucleophilic substitution unless under specific conditions. For aromatic rings, nucleophilic substitution usually requires a strong electron-withdrawing group, which activates the ring towards nucleophilic attack.

In this case, the Br is an EWG, but the adjacent group is a strong activating (electron-donating) group, which complicates things. Wait, the dimethylamino group is at position 2, and the Br is at position 1. So the ring has two substituents, one activating (position 2) and one deactivating (position 1).

If the base abstracts a proton from the ring near the activating group, perhaps creating a strong enough electron-withdrawing effect elsewhere for the Br to leave.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Friedel-Crafts type, but that's usually for electrophilic substitution. Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic aromatic substitution.

Alternatively, maybe the Br is eliminated, forming a benzene ring with a double bond. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possible reaction is the formation of aniline from bromobenzene via amination. But I think that's under different conditions.

Wait, perhaps the bromide is replaced by an amine group. So, substitution of Br with NH2.

But to do that, the ring must be activated towards nucleophilic substitution. If the ring is activated, perhaps the NH2- can attack.

But the dimethylamino group is activating, which is good for electrophilic substitution, but not sure about nucleophilic.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about possible products.

If substitution occurs, the Br is replaced by NH2. So the product would be 1-amino-2-dimethylaminobenzene. But wait, would that be the case? Or maybe the amine adds in a different position.

Wait, but the substitution would be at the same position as Br, right? So if Br is at position 1, then the substitution would also be at position 1.

Alternatively, considering that the dimethylamino group is a strong activating group, perhaps the ring is activated at positions ortho and para to it, but those positions are already taken by Br and perhaps another substituent.

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from the ring, making a carbanion, which could attack somewhere else.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to recall some similar reactions. For example, when a benzene ring has a nitro group (a strong EWG) and another substituent, sometimes nucleophilic substitution can occur. But in this case, the substituents are Br and dimethylamino.

Alternatively, perhaps the (CH3)2NH group is deprotonated by the base, but that's unlikely because (CH3)2NH is a weaker base than NaNH2.

Wait, another approach: the presence of a strong base like NaNH2 may lead to elimination. If the Br is in position 1, and the (CH3)2NH is in position 2, could a β-hydrogen be abstracted, leading to the elimination of HBr and the formation of a double bond between C1 and C2 or some other adjacent carbons?

Wait, but in benzene, all carbons are sp² hybridized, and the ring is already conjugated. So forming a double bond elsewhere isn't possible because that would disrupt the aromaticity. So elimination to form a double bond wouldn't make sense here.

Alternatively, perhaps the Br undergoes substitution. Since the ring has two substituents, the question is whether substitution can occur at the same position (ipso), or perhaps another position.

Wait, I've heard of the possibility of aromatic nucleophilic substitution under certain conditions. For instance, when the ring has strong electron-withdrawing groups, the ring becomes electron-deficient, making it susceptible to nucleophilic attack.

In this case, the Br is an EWG, but the dimethylamino group is an EDG. So the net effect on the ring? Well, the EDG would make the ring more activated for electrophilic substitution, but maybe the EWG (Br) in another position could make parts of the ring more susceptible to nucleophilic attack.

Hmm, but I'm not certain about this. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a benzene ring with a double bond to N, but that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is a displacement where the amination occurs, replacing Br with an NH2 group.

But would that happen here? If the NH2- is a strong nucleophile, and the ring is activated enough, substitution could occur.

Assuming substitution occurs, the product would have NH2 where Br was. So the product would be 1-amino-2-dimethylaminobenzene. But could that be the only product?

Wait, but the ring has two substituents. Let me imagine the structure: benzene with substituents at positions 1 (Br) and 2 ((CH3)2NH). Now, if substitution occurs at position 1, replacing Br with NH2, the new substituent would be at 1, and the dimethylamino at 2. So the product would have amino and dimethylamino groups at adjacent positions.

But how many products would that result in? If substitution occurs only at position 1, then only one product. Because the ring is symmetric? Wait, no, because the substituents are at adjacent positions. So the product would be a single structure.

Alternatively, perhaps elimination occurs, but I don't see how.

Wait, perhaps the (CH3)2NH group is eliminated, and the ring gets a double bond. But that would require removing two substituents, which doesn't seem likely.

Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a proton from the ring, making a benzyne intermediate. Wait, benzyne is a diradical or a triple bond in benzene, which can undergo various reactions.

Wait, that's a possibility. Let me think: benzyne formation. When a dihalobenzene is treated with a strong base, it can eliminate two equivalents of HX to form a triple bond, which is benzyne. But in our case, we have only one Br, so that wouldn't work.

Wait, but if the base abstracts a β-hydrogen next to Br, leading to elimination of HBr and formation of a triple bond (benzyne) between C1 and C2.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think: if the ring has Br at C1 and (CH3)2NH at C2, and the base abstracts a proton from C3, which is adjacent to C2. Then, the Br would be at C1, and perhaps the elimination would form a triple bond between C1 and C2, leading to benzyne.

But wait, benzyne is usually formed from 1,2-dihalobenzenes. So if you have a di-substituted benzene with halogens at 1 and 2, then elimination can form benzyne. But in this case, we have Br at 1 and (CH3)2NH at 2. So the question is, can the base abstract a proton at position 3, leading to elimination of Br and formation of a triple bond between 1 and 2?

Hmm, but the (CH3)2NH is a strong EDG, so maybe the ring is sufficiently activated for such elimination.

If benzyne is formed, then it's a highly reactive species that can undergo various reactions, such as adding nucleophiles or electrophiles.

But in the presence of NH2- (from NaNH2), perhaps the benzyne could react with the amide ion.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact reaction conditions. Alternatively, the benzyne could dimerize, but that would form a different product, which is not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyne could trap the amide ion, leading to a substituted benzene.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to outline the possibilities:

1. Substitution: Br is replaced by NH2, forming a diamine derivative. So, product is 1-amino-2-dimethylaminobenzene.

2. Elimination to form benzyne, which could then add NH2- in some positions.

Wait, elimination would lead to the formation of a triple bond, but the reaction conditions are NaNH2 in ammonia, which is a good nucleophile but not sure about the elimination conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyne intermediate can react further. Once benzyne is formed, it can react with an amide ion (NH2-) to form a new ring.

Wait, but benzyne has a triple bond, so when it reacts with a nucleophile, it could add in two positions. For example, the ammonia could act as a nucleophile, adding to the triple bond, leading to a new ring structure.

But I'm not exactly sure about the regiochemistry here. Alternatively, adding NH2- to the triple bond could form a new benzene ring with substituents.

Wait, but I'm not very confident about this possibility. Let me think about other reactions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not on the ring but on the dimethylamino group. But I don't see how because (CH3)2NH is a stable group under basic conditions.

Wait, another possibility: the (CH3)2NH group might lose a proton, but that would form (CH3)2NH2+, which is a weaker acid than NH3, so perhaps not.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's go back. The reagents are NaNH2 in ammonia, which is a strong base. The starting material is a bromobenzene derivative with a strong activating group (dimethylamino) in the adjacent position.

In such a case, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. For that to happen, the ring must be activated towards nucleophilic attack. The presence of a strong EWG (like nitro) is usually needed. But here, the Br is an EWG, but the ring is activated by the EDG (dimethylamino) in another position. So perhaps regions of the ring are activated for substitution.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a proton alpha to the Br, leading to a carbanion intermediate, which could attack the ring or undergo elimination.

Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere quickly. Let me think about the possible products.

If substitution occurs, the product would be 1-amino-2-dimethylaminobenzene. But is there any possibility of multiple substitution sites?

Wait, suppose the substitution isn't at position 1 but at another position. Since the dimethylamino group is at position 2 and is ortho/para directing, perhaps the substitution could occur at position 4 or position 6.

Wait, but the Br is at position 1, which is ortho to the dimethylamino group. Let me imagine the benzene ring:

Positions 1 (Br), 2 (dimethylamino), 3, 4, 5, 6.

Dimethylamino is at 2, so it's ortho/para directing. So the activating effect would be strongest at positions 3 (meta to 2), 4 (para to 2), and perhaps position 6 (meta to 2, but perhaps not as activated).

Wait, but since the Br is at position 1, which is adjacent to 2, maybe the substitution doesn't happen at position 1. Wait, but in substitution, the nucleophile would attack where?

Alternatively, perhaps the substitution occurs at position 4, which is para to the dimethylamino group.

But wait, the Br is at position 1, which is ortho to position 2. So if the dimethylamino group directs incoming electrophiles to its ortho and para positions, that would be positions 1 and 3 (but position 1 is already occupied by Br) and position 4.

Wait, but in nucleophilic substitution, maybe the directing effects are different. Alternatively, since the ring is activated by the dimethylamino group, the nucleophile (NH2-) could attack at positions activated by that group.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the possible products.

Option 1: Substitution at position 1, replacing Br with NH2. Product is 1-amino-2-dimethylaminobenzene.

Option 2: Substitution at position 4, replacing H with NH2. Product would be 4-amino-1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene.

But wait, can substitution occur at position 4? Because position 4 is para to the dimethylamino group, which is an activating group. So that position would be activated towards electrophilic substitution. But in this case, the nucleophile is attacking.

Wait, but under nucleophilic substitution, the directing effects would be different. Maybe the EWG (Br) at position 1 would deactive that area but activate others.

Alternatively, perhaps the substitution could occur at position 3 or 5, which are meta to the dimethylamino group.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck again. Alternatively, perhaps there are two possible sites for substitution, leading to two products.

Wait, but the starting material has substituents at positions 1 and 2. So when the NH2- attacks, it could attack at position 4 (para to dimethylamino) or perhaps position 3 or 5, which are meta to dimethylamino.

Wait, but the ring is already substituted with Br and dimethylamino. So the possible positions for substitution would be 3,4,5,6 (but 1 and 2 are taken). But taking into account the directing effects.

Wait, perhaps the dimethylamino group is activating and directs the substitution to its ortho and para positions. So that would be positions 1 (occupied by Br), 3 (meta to dimethylamino?), wait, no: the dimethylamino group is at position 2. So the ortho positions would be 1 and 3, para position would be 6.

Wait, but position 1 is already taken by Br. So the available positions would be 3 (ortho to dimethylamino) and 6 (para to dimethylamino).

So substitution could occur at position 3 and 6.

Wait, but the Br is at 1. So substitution at position 3 would be adjacent to Br. Hmm, but how does that affect the reaction?

Alternatively, perhaps the activation by the dimethylamino group makes positions 3 and 6 the most reactive towards substitution.

So if substitution occurs at position 3, the product would be 3-amino-1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene.

And substitution at position 6 would give 6-amino-1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene.

But wait, in such a case, would there be two possible products? Plus the possibility of substitution at position 1.

So that would make three possible products.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

If the reaction leads to substitution at position 1, we get one product. If substitution can occur at two other positions (3 and 6), that would be two more products, leading to a total of three.

But wait, in reality, would substitution at 3 and 6 be possible under these conditions?

Alternatively, perhaps substitution only occurs at position 1, giving one product.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let's think about how many products are possible.

Wait, the question is about how many possible organic products are formed. So if substitution can occur at positions 1, 3, and 6, that would be three products. But is that realistic?

Alternatively, perhaps substitution can only occur at position 1. Or perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed via substitution but via elimination, which would give a different product.

Wait, another thought: when the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the Br, the ring could form a benzynes intermediate. Then, this could react with the amide ion.

So if benzyne is formed, it's a very reactive triple bond. The amide ion could add to the triple bond.

Benzyne is symmetric, so the amide ion could add in two different ways, leading to different products.

Wait, but Benzynes can react with nucleophiles in two possible ways, leading to cis or trans addition. But in terms of substitution, perhaps the addition of NH2- could occur at either end, leading to different products.

Wait, if the benzyne forms between C1 and C2, then the triple bond is between those two positions. Then, the amide ion could attack either end, leading to NH2 groups at either C1 or C2. But wait, C1 already has Br. So perhaps, after elimination, the triple bond is formed, then the nucleophile could add to C3 or some other position.

Alternatively, perhaps the amide ion adds to the triple bond, leading to a new ring structure.

Wait, I'm not exactly sure. Let me think: when benzyne reacts with a nucleophile, it forms a new ring. For example, adding two equivalents of a nucleophile could form a di-substituted product.

Wait, but in this case, perhaps the benzyne would react with the amide ion in such a way that the product would have NH2 groups added.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a new benzene ring with the NH2 groups attached in different positions.

But I'm not very confident about this. Let's consider that when benzyne forms, it can react with the amide ion in two different ways, leading to two different products. So that would be two products.

But if substitution at position 1 is also possible, that would make three products. But I'm not sure if substitution and elimination can both happen in this scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps the main reaction is substitution, giving one product.

Hmm, but I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to think about the possible products again.

If substitution occurs, the possible products would depend on where the substitution happens.

Assuming substitution at position 1: 1-amino-2-dimethylaminobenzene.

If substitution occurs at position 3: 3-amino-1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene.

If substitution occurs at position 6: 6-amino-1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene.

So that's three products.

But wait, the starting material has substituents at positions 1 and 2. So if substitution occurs at position 3, which is adjacent to position 2 (the dimethylamino group), that might be more favorable due to the activating effect.

Similarly, substitution at position 6 would be para to the dimethylamino group, which is also an activated position.

But would substitution occur at all these positions under these conditions?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to substitution only at position 1, giving one product.

But given that the substituents are at 1 and 2, the para position to the dimethylamino group would be position 6. So substitution at 6 would be another possible product.

Wait, but if substitution occurs at both position 1 and position 6, that's two products.

Wait, but how many substitution sites are available and activated?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to substitution at position 1 only, giving one product.

But I'm not sure. Another approach: perhaps the product is only one.

Because the reaction conditions are such that NaNH2 in ammonia is a strong base, and perhaps the only feasible reaction is substitution of Br by NH2.

Wait, but then why is there a dimethylamino group in the structure? Because that group is activating, so the ring is activated, making substitution possible.

So the product would have NH2 where Br was. So one product. So the answer would be B) 1.

But wait, I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps elimination occurs, leading to benzyne, which then adds the amide ion to form a different structure.

If benzyne is formed, perhaps it adds the amide in two positions, leading to two products.

For example, adding NH2- to one end of the triple bond could give a product where NH2 is at position 1, and adding to the other end would give NH2 at position 2. But position 2 already has the dimethylamino group, so that substitution isn't possible.

Wait, maybe that's not correct. The triple bond is between positions 1 and 2, so when the nucleophile attacks, it could add to position 3 or position 6, leading to different products.

But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyne could add two NH2 groups, but that's unlikely under these conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the substitution of Br with NH2, giving one product, and elimination leading to another product, like a nitrile or something else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe the dimethylamino group is deprotonated by the base, but that's unlikely because (CH3)2NH is a weaker base than NaNH2. Wait, no, NaNH2 is a stronger base than (CH3)2NH, so it can deprotonate it.

Wait, (CH3)2NH has a pKa around 38, while NaNH2 is a stronger base than NH3. So, in a strongly basic solution, (CH3)2NH could lose a proton to form (CH3)2NH2+.

But how does that help? Maybe the (CH3)2NH2+ could act as a leaving group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the deprotonation of (CH3)2NH leads to the formation of a better leaving group.

Wait, but I'm not sure. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

So, considering all the possibilities, the most likely reaction is substitution of Br with NH2, giving one product. Therefore, the answer would be option B) 1.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Another possibility is that elimination occurs, leading to benzyne, which could then add the amide ion in two different positions, giving two products. So that would make two products.

But if substitution is possible, that's another product, making three. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to only one product because the substitution is the only feasible pathway.

But without more knowledge, it's hard to be certain. Based on what I think, the substitution occurs at position 1, leading to one product. So the answer is B) 1.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d (interpreted as 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene) with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia. The key considerations are the reactivity of the substituents on the benzene ring and the nature of the reaction conditions.

1. **Structure of the Starting Material**:  
   The molecule has a bromine atom at position 1 and a dimethylamino group at position 2 on the benzene ring. The dimethylamino group is a strong electron-donating group (activating) and ortho/para-directing, while bromine is an electron-withdrawing group (deactivating) and meta-directing.

2. **Reaction Conditions**:  
   NaNH₂ in ammonia is a strong base, often used for deprotonation or nucleophilic substitution. The presence of the dimethylamino group makes the ring more reactive toward electrophilic or nucleophilic substitution, depending on the mechanism.

3. **Possible Reactions**:  
   - **Substitution**: The bromine atom at position 1 could be replaced by the amide ion (NH₂⁻), resulting in 1-amino-2-dimethylaminobenzene. This is a plausible pathway due to the activating effect of the dimethylamino group.  
   - **Elimination**: The formation of a benzyne intermediate (a highly reactive triple bond) is possible if a β-hydrogen is abstracted, leading to elimination of HBr. However, this is less likely under the given conditions.  
   - **Multiple Substitution Sites**: Substitution could theoretically occur at positions 3 or 6 (meta to the dimethylamino group), but these positions are less activated compared to position 1. Thus, substitution at these positions is less favorable.

4. **Analysis of Products**:  
   - Substitution at position 1 (replacing Br with NH₂) is the most likely reaction, yielding a single product: 1-amino-2-dimethylaminobenzene.  
   - Substitution at positions 3 or 6 is less likely due to lower activation at these sites.  
   - Elimination is unlikely to occur under these conditions, as the reaction does not strongly favor the formation of a benzyne intermediate.

5. **Conclusion**:  
   The most feasible reaction is substitution at position 1, leading to a single product. No other reaction pathways are strongly supported under the given conditions.

Answer: B
