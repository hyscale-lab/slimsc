Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The problem gives me the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. And they mention the pH is ideal, so I probably don't have to worry about other factors like hydrolysis or anything like that.

Wait, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions. So in this case, Ca^2+ is bound to EDTA, forming the Ca-EDTA complex. The complex is given as 0.02 M. I think the key here is to find the concentration of free calcium ions in solution.

The formation constant K is given, so I should use that. Formation constants, or stability constants, tell us how much the complex is formed. The higher the K, the more stable the complex, meaning more of the metal is tied up in the complex.

The formula for the formation constant is: K = [Ca-EDTA] / ([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). Wait, but in this case, the solution is purely the Ca-EDTA complex. So I should think about the dissociation of the complex into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4−.

So, the complex dissociates as: Ca-EDTA ↔ Ca^2+ + EDTA^4−. The K for this reaction would be the inverse of the formation constant. Because formation is Ca^2+ + EDTA^4− → Ca-EDTA, which is K_form. The dissociation is the reverse, so Kdissociate = 1/K_form.

So Kdissociate = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

Wait, but the formation constant is K = [complex]/([metal][ligand]). So when the complex dissociates, Kd = [metal][ligand]/[complex]. So Kd = 1/Kf. Oh right, so Kd is 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

Now, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's let [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 M at equilibrium. Then, the concentrations of Ca^2+ and EDTA^4− would be equal because the stoichiometry is 1:1. Let me call each of them x.

So, Kd = (x)(x) / 0.02 = x² / 0.02.

But Kd is 2e-11, so:

x² / 0.02 = 2e-11 → x² = 0.02 * 2e-11 → 0.02 is 2e-2, so 2e-2 * 2e-11 = (2*2)e-13 = 4e-13.

So x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2 * 1e-6.5? Wait, 1e-6.5 is the same as 3.16e-7, because 10^(-6.5) is about 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is approximately 6.32e-7.

Wait, wait, that's 6.32e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that's probably the answer.

But let me double-check. Oh yeah, because when a complex dissociates into metal and ligand, the concentration of each is x. So Kd = x² / [complex], and solving gives x = sqrt(Kd * [complex]).

Wait, but wait another thing. What's the initial concentration? The solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA. So when it dissociates, the complex breaks down into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4−, each with concentration x.

So if the initial concentration of Ca-EDTA is 0.02 M, and it dissociates into x of each, then the total Ca comes from that dissociation. So the [Ca^2+] is x, which is 6.32e-7 M.

Yes, that makes sense. The concentration of calcium ions is about 6.3e-7 M. So the answer should be option C.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the dissociation equilibrium:

\[
\text{Ca-EDTA} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The dissociation constant \( K_d \) is related to the formation constant \( K_f \) by:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K_f}
\]

Given \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \), we calculate:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}
\]

At equilibrium, the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, and the concentrations of free Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻ are equal due to the 1:1 stoichiometry. Let the concentration of free Ca²⁺ be \( x \). Using the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_d = \frac{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}{[Ca-EDTA]} = \frac{x^2}{0.02}
\]

Substituting \( K_d = 2 \times 10^{-11} \):

\[
\frac{x^2}{0.02} = 2 \times 10^{-11}
\]

\[
x^2 = 0.02 \times 2 \times 10^{-11} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions in solution is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.

The formula for the formation constant is: K = [Ca-EDTA] / ([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). Wait, but in this case, the solution is purely the Ca-EDTA complex. So I should think about the dissociation of the complex into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4−.

So, the complex dissociates as: Ca-EDTA ↔ Ca^2+ + EDTA^4−. The K for this reaction would be the inverse of the formation constant. Because formation is Ca^2+ + EDTA^4− → Ca-EDTA, which is K_form. The dissociation is the reverse, so Kdissociate = 1/K_form.

So Kdissociate = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

Wait, but the formation constant is K = [complex]/([metal][ligand]). So when the complex dissociates, Kd = [metal][ligand]/[complex]. So Kd = 1/Kf. Oh right, so Kd is 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

Now, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's let [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 M at equilibrium. Then, the concentrations of Ca^2+ and EDTA^4− would be equal because the stoichiometry is 1:1. Let me call each of them x.

So, Kd = (x)(x) / 0.02 = x² / 0.02.

But Kd is 2e-11, so:

x² / 0.02 = 2e-11 → x² = 0.02 * 2e-11 → 0.02 is 2e-2, so 2e-2 * 2e-11 = (2*2)e-13 = 4e-13.

So x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2 * 1e-6.5? Wait, 1e-6.5 is the same as 3.16e-7, because 10^(-6.5) is about 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is approximately 6.32e-7.

Wait, wait, that's 6.32e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that's probably the answer.

But let me double-check. Oh yeah, because when a complex dissociates into metal and ligand, the concentration of each is x. So Kd = x² / [complex], and solving gives x = sqrt(Kd * [complex]).

Wait, but wait another thing. What's the initial concentration? The solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA. So when it dissociates, the complex breaks down into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4−, each with concentration x.

So if the initial concentration of Ca-EDTA is 0.02 M, and it dissociates into x of each, then the total Ca comes from that dissociation. So the [Ca^2+] is x, which is 6.32e-7 M.

Yes, that makes sense. The concentration of calcium ions is about 6.3e-7 M. So the answer should be option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the dissociation equilibrium:

\[
\text{Ca-EDTA} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The dissociation constant \( K_d \) is related to the formation constant \( K_f \) by:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K_f}
\]

Given \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \), we calculate:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}
\]

At equilibrium, the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, and the concentrations of free Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻ are equal due to the 1:1 stoichiometry. Let the concentration of free Ca²⁺ be \( x \). Using the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_d = \frac{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}{[Ca-EDTA]} = \frac{x^2}{0.02}
\]

Substituting \( K_d = 2 \times 10^{-11} \):

\[
\frac{x^2}{0.02} = 2 \times 10^{-11}
\]

\[
x^2 = 0.02 \times 2 \times 10^{-11} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions in solution is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
