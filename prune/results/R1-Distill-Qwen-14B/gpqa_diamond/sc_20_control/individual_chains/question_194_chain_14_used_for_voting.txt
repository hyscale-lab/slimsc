Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). I need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, partition function is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), right? β is 1/(kT), but since we're given β, I don't have to worry about that part. So I need to consider all possible configurations of S1, S2, S3 and calculate their energies, then sum the exponentials.

Each spin can be +1 or -1. So there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. Maybe I should list all possible states and compute E for each.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a smarter way without listing all 8. Let's think about the possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Wait, each term S_i S_j is either +1 or -1 because each S_i is ±1. So each product is 1 if the two spins are the same, -1 otherwise.

The sum is S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Let's denote this sum as H. So E = -J H, so each state contributes exp(β J H) to the partition function Z.

So for each possible H, I can find how many states have that H value and multiply by exp(β J H) and sum all that.

So what are the possible values of H?

H can be 3, 1, -1, -3. Let's see:

If all three spins are the same, say all +1: then each product is 1. H=1+1+1=3.

If two are +1 and one is -1: Let's say S3 is -1, S1 and S2 are +1. So S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. So H=1-1-1 = -1.

Wait, that's H=-1. Wait, but maybe there are other possibilities. Or perhaps let me think again.

Wait, another case: two spins are the same, but maybe in a different arrangement. For example, S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1: H=1*1 +1*(-1) +1*(-1) = 1-1-1= -1.

Alternatively, S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1: then H = (-1) + (1) + (-1) = -1.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the sum can also be 1. Let's see: what if exactly two of the products are 1 and one is -1. Because that would give H=1+1-1=1.

Wait, how? Let's take S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1: H=3.

If all are -1, same thing: each product is 1, so H=3.

Wait, but when two are same, one different: H=-1. When all are same, H=3. What about when exactly two products are 1 and one is -1? For example, S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1: as before, H=1-1-1 =-1. Hmm, that doesn't give me H=1.

Wait, maybe another configuration. Let's think of S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1. Then S1S2 = -1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3=1. So H= (-1) + (-1) + 1 = -1.

Wait, that's still H=-1. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps H can't be 1 but can be only 3, 1, -1, -3.

Wait, let me think in terms of the number of pairs that are aligned. Because each term S_i S_j is 1 if they are aligned, -1 if not.

So the maximum possible H is 3 when all are aligned.

If two are aligned and one is not, like two aligned and one opposite, but perhaps in a way that two products are 1 and one is -1.

Wait, let's say S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1: H=3.

If S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1: H=1*(S1S2) + S1S3 + S2S3. S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. So H=1-1-1= -1.

Wait, that's H=-1.

Wait, what about a case where H is 1? Let's see: suppose two terms are 1, and the third is 1. Oh, that's H=3. So maybe no, perhaps H can't be 1. So what other possibilities are there?

Wait, maybe when two terms are 1 and one is -1. Let's see: for that to happen, two pairs must be aligned, and one pair not. But in three spins, is that possible?

Wait, let me think: if S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1: all aligned, H=3.

If S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1: then S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. So sum is 1-1-1= -1.

Alternatively, S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1: S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum: -1 +1 -1 =-1.

Another option: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1. Then S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum: -1 -1 +1 =-1.

Wait, but for H=1, perhaps another case. Let me think. Suppose S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1. Wait, this gives H=-1 as before.

Wait, maybe I'm missing a case where H=1. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps when two pairs are aligned and one pair is opposite. But how can that happen?

Wait, perhaps I should consider all possible cases.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute H for each possible state.

Let me list all 8 possible states:

1. S1=1, S2=1, S3=1:

H = 1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 = 3.

E = -J*3.

2. S1=1, S2=1, S3=-1:

H = 1 + (1*(-1)) + (1*(-1)) = 1-1-1 = -1.

E = -J*(-1) = J.

3. S1=1, S2=-1, S3=1:

H = (1*(-1)) + (1*1) + (-1*1) = -1 +1 -1 = -1.

E = J.

4. S1=1, S2=-1, S3=-1:

H = (-1) + (-1) + (1) = -1.

E= J.

5. S1=-1, S2=1, S3=1:

H = (-1*1) + (-1*1) + (1*1) = -1 -1 +1 = -1.

E= J.

6. S1=-1, S2=1, S3=-1:

H = (-1*1) + (-1*(-1)) + (1*(-1)) = -1 +1 -1 = -1.

E= J.

7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=1:

H = ( (-1)*(-1) ) + (-1 *1) + (-1 *1) = 1 -1 -1 = -1.

E= J.

8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1:

H = 1 +1 +1 =3.

E= -3 J.

So looking at all 8 states, the energies are either -3J or J.

Wait, but wait, let me check the calculation for H in each case.

Wait, for state 2: S1=1, S2=1, S3=-1.

H= S1S2 (1*1) + S1S3 (1*(-1)) + S2S3 (1*(-1)).

So H=1 -1 -1 = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J.

Similarly, state 3: S1=1, S2=-1, S3=1.

H= (1*-1) = -1, S1S3=1, S2S3= (-1)*1= -1. So sum is (-1) + (1) + (-1) = -1.

E= J.

Same for state 4: S1=1, S2=-1, S3=-1.

H= (1*-1)=-1, S1S3= 1*-1=-1, S2S3= (-1)*-1=1. So sum is (-1) + (-1) +1 =-1. E= J.

State5: S1=-1, S2=1, S3=1.

H= (-1*1)= -1, S1S3=(-1)*1=-1, S2S3=1*1=1. Sum: -1 -1 +1= -1. E= J.

State6: S1=-1, S2=1, S3=-1.

H= (-1*1)=-1, S1S3= (-1*-1)=1, S2S3= 1*-1=-1. Sum: -1 +1 -1 =-1. E= J.

State7: S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=1.

H= (-1*-1)=1, S1S3= (-1*1)=-1, S2S3= (-1)*1= -1. Sum: 1 -1 -1 =-1. E= J.

Only states 1 and 8 have H=3, which gives E= -3J.

The other 6 states have H=-1, E= J.

So the partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp( β E ), which is exp( β*(-3J) ) for two states, and exp( β*(J) ) for six states.

Wait, wait! Because E is given as E= -J H, so E = -J H.

Wait, for each state, E is -J H, which for H=3, E is -3J; for H=-1, E is J.

So each state contributes exp( -β E ) = exp( β J H ) ?

Wait, no, wait. The partition function is sum_{states} exp( -β E ), because Z = sum exp( -β E ).

So E = -J H, so -β E = β J H.

So each state contributes exp( β J H ).

So for the two states where H=3, each contributes exp(3 β J).

There are two such states (all +1 and all -1), so 2 * exp(3 β J).

For the other 6 states where H=-1, each contributes exp( (-1) * β J ), so exp(-β J). 6 states, so 6 * exp(-β J).

So Z = 2 exp(3 β J) + 6 exp( -β J ).

Looking at the options:

Option A: Z= 2 e^{-3Jβ} +6e^{Jβ} → No, because 3Jβ is positive in the exponent. Wait, in our case, for H=3, the exponent is positive: 3 J β.

So option A has the first term as e^{-3Jβ}, which would be for H=-3, but that doesn't exist here. So A is wrong.

Option B: Z= 2 e^{3Jβ} +6e^{-Jβ} → Hmm, yes that's what I have. So 2 exp(3Jβ) plus 6 exp(-Jβ).

Wait, but the options have e^{3Jβ} and e^{-Jβ}, but looking back at the calculation, when H=3, the exp is positive. So yes, option B matches.

Wait, let me double-check.

H=3 → each of these two states contributes exp(3 J β ), so 2 * exp(3 J β).

H=-1 → each of these six states contributes exp( (-1)* J β ), so 6 * exp( - J β ), but wait wait: no.

Wait, because H=-1, so in the exponent it's β * J * H = β J * (-1) = - β J.

So exp(β J H) = exp(-β J ), which is correct.

So the partition function is 2 e^{3 J β} +6 e^{- J β}.

Looking at the options, that's option B.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Options:

A) Z= 2 e^{-3Jβ}+6e^{Jβ} → No, first term is e^{-3}.

B) Z= 2 e^{3Jβ} +6e^{-Jβ} → Yes, this matches.

Wait, but the given energy is E = -J (sum). So when H=3, E=-3J, so exp(-β E) becomes exp(3 J β). Correct.

So the answer should be option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To find the partition function \( Z \) for the system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), each of which can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), we start with the energy expression \( E = -J(S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3) \). The partition function is given by:

\[
Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} e^{-\beta E},
\]
where \( \beta = 1/(kT) \). Since \( E = -JH \) (with \( H = S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \)), we have \( e^{-\beta E} = e^{\beta JH} \). Thus, \( Z \) becomes:

\[
Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} e^{\beta JH}.
\]

### Step 1: Possible values of \( H \)
Each term \( S_iS_j \) is \( +1 \) if the spins are aligned and \( -1 \) if they are anti-aligned. The sum \( H = S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \) can take the following values:
- \( H = 3 \): All three spins are aligned (e.g., \( S_1 = S_2 = S_3 = +1 \)).
- \( H = -1 \): Two spins are aligned, and one is anti-aligned (e.g., \( S_1 = S_2 = +1, S_3 = -1 \)).

### Step 2: Counting states for each \( H \)
- For \( H = 3 \): There are 2 such states (all \( +1 \) or all \( -1 \)).
- For \( H = -1 \): There are 6 such states, corresponding to the different ways one spin can be anti-aligned while the other two are aligned.

### Step 3: Contributions to \( Z \)
For each state, the contribution to \( Z \) is \( e^{\beta JH} \). Thus:
- For \( H = 3 \): Each of the 2 states contributes \( e^{\beta J \cdot 3} = e^{3\beta J} \), so the total contribution is \( 2e^{3\beta J} \).
- For \( H = -1 \): Each of the 6 states contributes \( e^{\beta J \cdot (-1)} = e^{-\beta J} \), so the total contribution is \( 6e^{-\beta J} \).

### Step 4: Final expression for \( Z \)
Summing the contributions, the partition function is:

\[
Z = 2e^{3\beta J} + 6e^{-\beta J}.
\]

### Step 5: Matching with the options
Comparing this result with the given options:
- **Option A**: \( Z = 2e^{-3J\beta} + 6e^{J\beta} \) is incorrect because the first term has \( e^{-3J\beta} \), which does not match \( e^{3J\beta} \).
- **Option B**: \( Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta} \) matches exactly with the derived expression.
- **Option C**: \( Z = 2e^{2J\beta} + 6e^{-2J\beta} \) is incorrect because the exponents do not match.
- **Option D**: \( Z = 6e^{2J\beta} + 2e^{-2J\beta} \) is incorrect because the coefficients and exponents do not match.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
