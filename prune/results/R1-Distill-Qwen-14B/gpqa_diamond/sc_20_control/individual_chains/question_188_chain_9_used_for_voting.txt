Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the interplanar distance for a rhombohedral crystal's (111) plane. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distance is calculated using some formula involving the crystal's lattice parameters. But wait, rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal and all angles equal too, right? So in this case, the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, which I think is the lattice parameter 'a' because in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c.

The formula for interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)( (1 - cos α)/(sin α)^2 ) ), but wait, no, maybe that's not quite right. Or perhaps I'm mixing it up with something else. Oh right, the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal is 1/d^2 = (h^2 +k^2 +l^2)/(a^2) [1 - (cos α)/(sin α)^2 (something)]... Wait, maybe I should think about the Miller indices and the structure factor.

Alternatively, I remember that for a rhombohedral system, the formula simplifies because all the sides are equal and all angles are the same. The formula for the interplanar distance d_{hkl} in a rhombohedral crystal is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + kl + lh)cos α ), but wait, no, wait another thing. Wait, the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles α, β, γ is given by the reciprocal of the square root of (h²/a² + k²/b² + l²/c² - 2hk cos β/(a b) - 2kl cos γ/(b c) - 2lh cos α/(a c)).

But in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c = a0, and all angles are equal, say α. So the formula simplifies. Let me think: the denominator becomes (h² + k² + l²)/(a0²) - 2hk cos α/(a0²) - 2kl cos α/(a0²) - 2lh cos α/(a0²). Because for rhombohedral, all the angles between the axes are the same, so cos β and cos gamma are cos α as well.

Wait, wait. Let me write this out again. The general formula is:

1/d² = (h²/a² + k²/b² + l²/c²) - (2hk cos γ)/(a b) - (2kl cos α)/(b c) - (2lh cos β)/(a c)

But for rhombohedral, a = b = c = a0, and α=β=γ. So substituting,

1/d² = [h² +k² + l²]/a0² - [2hk cos α + 2kl cos α + 2lh cos α ]/(a0²)

Factor the denominator:

= [h² +k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2kl cos α - 2 lh cos α ] / a0²

Hmm, wait, that looks a bit complicated. Alternatively, I remember that for a rhombohedral system, the formula can be written as:

1/d² = (h² +k² + l²) / a² - 2 (hk + kl + lh) cos α / a²

So that's 1/d² = [h² +k² + l² - 2(hk + kl + lh) cos α ] / a².

Ah, that makes sense. So for the (111) plane, h =k =l=1.

So plugging those in:

1/d² = [1 +1 +1 - 2 (1*1 +1*1 +1*1 ) cos 30° ] / (10)^2.

Compute numerator: 3 - 2*(3)(cos 30°) = 3 - 6*(√3/2) = 3 - 3√3.

Wait, √3 is approximately 1.732, so 3√3 ≈5.196. So 3 -5.196 ≈ -2.196. But wait, that would make the numerator negative, which can't be right because 1/d² can't be negative. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, maybe I messed up the signs. Let me double-check the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is 1/d² = (h² +k² + l² - 2(hk + kl + lh) cos α ) / a².

Wait, wait, no. Let me try to recast it. If α is the interaxial angle between a and b, but in the formula for the interplanar distance, the cross terms involve cos of the angle between the respective axes.

Wait, perhaps I should recall that in a rhombohedral system, the volume of the unit cell is a³ * sqrt(1 - 3 cos² α + 2 cos³ α ) ) or something like that. But perhaps that's a tangent.

Wait, maybe I should go back to the general formula. For a cubic system (angles 90 degrees), the formula is d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² ), which makes sense. But for rhombohedral, the angles are different.

Let me think again about the formula for interplanar distance. The formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) - 2(hk + kl + lh) cos α )

Wait, wait, no—because the cross terms would involve the cosines of the angles between the lattice vectors.

Wait, another approach: the interplanar distance can be found using the formula:

d = (a) / sqrt( [ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + kl + lh) cos α ] )

Wait, but that can't be right because in the cubic case, cos α is zero, so it reduces to d = a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²), which is correct.

Wait, that's possible. So let's test this with the cubic case. For cubic, α=90°, so cos α =0. So 1/d² = (h² +k² +l²)/a², correct.

So I think the correct formula is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² - 2(hk + kl + lh) cos α )

But wait, wait, that's assuming that all angles are the same and a=b=c. So in our problem, a=10 Angstrom, α=30°, and hkl is 1,1,1.

So plugging in the numbers:

d = 10 / sqrt( 1 +1 +1 - 2*(1*1 +1*1 +1*1)*cos 30° )

Compute the denominator:

1+1+1 =3.

Then, 2*(1 +1 +1 )=6. So 6 * cos 30°. Cos 30° is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660.

So 6 * 0.8660 ≈5.196.

So denominator: sqrt(3 -5.196) = sqrt(-2.196) → Wait, that gives a negative under the square root, which is impossible. That can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula. Maybe the denominator is (h² +k² + l²) + 2(hk + kl + lh) cos α.

Wait, let's think again. Because in the cubic case, the denominator would be (h² +k² + l²), which is correct, but in rhombohedral cases with angles, the sign might be different.

Wait, perhaps I should refer to the general formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral system. Alternatively, maybe the formula is 1/d² = (h² +k² +l²) / a² - 2 (hk + kl + lh) cos α / a².

Wait, no, wait the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles α, β, γ is:

1/d² = (h²/a² + k²/b² + l²/c² ) - (2 hk cos γ)/(a b) - (2 kl cos α)/(b c) - (2 lh cos β)/(a c).

But in rhombohedral, a = b = c and α = β = γ. So substituting, this becomes:

1/d² = (h² +k² + l²) / a² - [ 2 hk cos α + 2 kl cos α + 2 lh cos α ] / a².

Factor out 1/a² and 2 cos α:

= [ h² +k² + l² - 2 cos α (hk + kl + lh) ) ] / a².

So now, for the (111) plane, h=k=l=1.

So numerator becomes:

1 +1 +1 - 2 * cos 30° * (1*1 +1*1 +1*1 )

Which is 3 - 2*(sqrt(3)/2)*3 → 3 - 3*sqrt(3).

Wait, that's 3 - 3*1.732 ≈3 - 5.196 = -2.196.

Again, negative, which can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in applying the formula.

Wait, perhaps I have the sign wrong. Maybe it's +2 cos α instead of -2. Let me check.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure of the formula. In cubic systems, when α is 90°, cos α is zero, so the cross terms vanish, leaving 1/d² = (h² +k² +l²)/a², correct.

But in a rhombohedral system with α <90°, the cross terms contribute positively, which could make the denominator in 1/d² smaller, leading to a larger d. Wait, but in our problem, the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, but the options are around 9 Angstroms. Hmm, perhaps that's because the formula includes a factor that reduces the denominator.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the signs.

Wait, let me re-derive the formula. The interplanar distance for (hkl) is given by:

d = [ (a^2 (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2 a^2 (hk + kl + lh) cos α ) ]^(-1/2)

Wait, that can't be right because in the cubic case, cos α is zero, but that would make d = a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²), which is correct.

But for our problem, when α is 30°, the term (hk + kl + lh) is 3, and cos α is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So:

denominator inside sqrt is a² (3 - 2 * 3 * 0.866 )

Wait, wait, 2 * (hk+ kl + lh) cos α = 2 *3 * 0.866 ≈5.196.

So 3 -5.196 = -2.196.

Hmm, that's negative again. So that's impossible. So I must have the wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is 1/d² = (h² +k² + l²)/(a²) [ 1 + 2 cos α ] or something else. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate using vectors.

Another approach: the interplanar distance can be found using the reciprocal vectors.

The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

b1 = (2π/a) * (1, 1, 1) / √(1 +1 +1 + 2cos α (1 +1 +1)) ), but I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, the plane (hkl) corresponds to the reciprocal vector (h, k, l) in the reciprocal lattice. The length of this reciprocal vector is 2π/d.

So, the reciprocal vector length squared is (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) (a^2) [ 1/(a^2) ) ] [ terms involving cos α ].

Wait, maybe I should compute the dot product of the reciprocal vectors. Alternatively, the formula for the reciprocal vectors in a rhombohedral system is more complicated.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the volume of the unit cell and then use the formula involving hkl and the volume.

The volume V of a rhombohedral unit cell is a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 α + 2 cos^3 α )

But I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again.

In a rhombohedral system, the unit cell is a parallelepiped with vectors a, b, c all of length a0, and the angles between them are α. The volume V is a0^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 α + 2 cos^3 α )

Wait, I'm not certain about that, but perhaps it's correct. So for α=30°, cos α= sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So V = a0^3 * sqrt(1 - 3*(0.866)^2 + 2*(0.866)^3 )

Compute each term:

3*(0.866)^2 = 3*(0.750) = 2.25.

2*(0.866)^3 = 2*(0.6495) ≈1.299.

So inside the sqrt: 1 - 2.25 +1.299 = (1 -2.25) is -1.25, plus 1.299 → approx 0.049.

So sqrt(0.049) ≈0.2215.

So V ≈ (10)^3 * 0.2215 ≈1000 *0.2215=221.5 Ang^3.

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful, but maybe it can help in another approach.

Alternatively, the interplanar distance d can be found using:

d = (a) * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + kl + lh) cos α ) )^{-1}.

Wait, but earlier that approach led to a negative denominator. Maybe I should check the formula again.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h^2 +k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + kl + lh) cos α )

Wait, let me test with the cubic case, where α=90°, cos α=0. So d= a/sqrt(h² +k² +l² ), correct.

In our problem, (111) plane, so h=k=l=1, a=10, α=30°, cos α=sqrt(3)/2≈0.866.

So denominator: 1 +1 +1 + 2*(1+1+1)*0.866.

=3 + 2*3*0.866.

=3 + 5.196 → 8.196.

So sqrt(8.196)≈2.863.

So d=10 /2.863 ≈3.494 Angstrom.

Wait, but none of the options are that low. The options are around 8-10 Angstrom. So clearly, I must have the formula wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the formula as 1/d² = (h² +k² + l²)/a² - 2 (hk + kl + lh) (cos α) / a².

Wait, let's compute that.

For (111), h=k=l=1.

So 1/d² = (3)/a² - 2*(3)*(cos 30°)/a².

= [3 - 6*(sqrt(3)/2) ] / a².

= [3 - 3*sqrt(3)] /a².

Which is [3 -5.196]/a^2 = (-2.196)/a^2 → which would make d² negative, impossible. So that can't be right.

Wait, maybe I have the signs backwards. What if the formula is 1/d² = (h² +k² +l²)/a² + 2 (hk + kl + lh) cos α /a².

So plugging the same numbers:

[3 + 6*(0.866)]/a².

3 +5.196 =8.196.

So 1/d² = 8.196 / (10)^2 = 8.196/100 =0.08196.

So d²=1/0.08196 ≈12.202 → d≈3.49 Angstrom. Again, not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Maybe the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal is different. I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should look for another approach.

Another thought: The interplanar distance can be found using the formula:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + kl + lh) cos α )

Wait, let me try that.

h=k=l=1, a=10, α=30°, cos α= sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So numerator is 10.

Denominator: 3 + 2*(3)*0.866 =3 +5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

So d=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstrom. But that's way lower than the options given (which are ~9-10). So I'm clearly doing something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I confused the formula. Another approach: perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2 (hk + kl + lh) cos α )

Wait, let me try that.

Denominator: 3 - 2*3 *0.866 =3 -5.196= -2.196 → which is negative, so impossible.

Hmm, this is getting frustrating. Maybe I should think about the relation between interplanar distance and the Miller indices.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the volume of the unit cell and then use the formula involving hkl, the volume, and the interplanar distance.

The formula for the interplanar distance is also given by:

d_{hkl} = 1/ [ ( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) )^(1/2) * ( (a^2)(b^2)(c^2) )^(1/3) ) * ... ]

No, I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps using the plane's normal vector. The (111) plane in a cubic system has a certain interplanar distance, but for a rhombohedral system, it's different.

Wait, perhaps the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system can be found using the following formula:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk +kl + lh) cos α )

But as before, that gives a too small d.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h^2 +k^2 + l^2 - 2 (hk + kl + lh) cos α )

But that gives negative again.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is d = a/(sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2 (hk + kl + lh) cos α )) )

Wait, but that again gives a negative denominator.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the correct formula. Alternatively, perhaps I can reason that in a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance for (111) can be calculated using the conventional formula with a correction factor based on the angles.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a * sqrt( [ (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + kl + lh) cos α ] )^{-1}.

Wait, but that's the same as before.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that in a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal lattice is also rhombohedral, and the reciprocal vectors are different.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try another approach.

Let me think about the structure of the crystal. The (111) plane means that the planes cut the x, y, z axes at (a,0,0), (0,a,0), (0,0,a) in the unit cell. But in a rhombohedral system, the axes are not orthogonal, so the actual distance is different.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Miller indices and the lattice parameters to find the direction of the plane and then compute the interplanar distance.

Another approach: The interplanar distance can be found using the formula:

d = [ (a^2 (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) ) / ( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + kl + lh) cos α ) ]^(1/2)

Wait, no, that seems off. Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is multiplied by a squared.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try the formula:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2 (hk + kl + lh) (1 - cos α) )

Wait, let's try that.

h=k=l=1, a=10, α=30°, cos α=0.866.

Denominator: 3 + 2*3*(1-0.866) =3 +6*(0.134)=3 +0.804=3.804.

sqrt(3.804)=1.95.

d=10/1.95≈5.129 Angstrom. Still not matching the options.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² + l² + 2 (hk + kl + lh) cos α )

Which would give:

d=10 / sqrt(3 +6*(0.866))=10/sqrt(3+5.196)=10/sqrt(8.196)=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstrom. Again not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the interplanar distance in terms of the unit vectors.

In a rhombohedral system, the unit vectors can be represented as a, b, c, each of length a0, and with angles α between each. The volume of the unit cell is a0^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 α + 2 cos^3 α ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance for (111) is given by:

d = a0 / sqrt( (1^2 +1^2 +1^2) + 2(1*1 +1*1 +1*1) cos α )

Wait, but that's what I tried earlier and it gave 3.49 Angstrom, which is way too small. The options are around 9 Angstrom.

Wait, wait a second. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. But in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance is a0, which is the distance between nearest atoms. So perhaps I should be using a0=10 Angstrom. But in the formula for interplanar distance, 'a' is the lattice parameter, which for a rhombohedral system, is the length of the vectors a, b, c. But wait, in a simple cubic structure, the lattice parameter is the same as the interatomic distance. But in a rhombohedral structure, perhaps the lattice parameter is different?

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between the interatomic distance and the lattice parameter. In a cubic structure, the interatomic distance is the same as the lattice parameter. But in a rhombohedral structure, the lattice parameter a might be different from the interatomic distance.

Wait, no, in a rhombohedral system, the atoms are at the vertices of the rhombohedral lattice. So the interatomic distance is the distance between adjacent atoms, which would be the same as the lattice parameter a. So a=10 Angstrom.

Hmm, but according to the options, the d for (111) is around 9 Angstrom, which is close to that of the lattice parameter. But according to the formula, it's either 3.49 Angstrom or some other impossible value.

Wait, perhaps I should try a different approach. Let me consider the structure of the (111) plane. In a cubic system, the (111) planes are closer together, but in a rhombohedral system with angles less than 90 degrees, the planes might be further apart.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the vector approach. The plane equation is (111), so the normal vector is (1,1,1). The interplanar distance is the distance between two adjacent planes, which can be calculated using the formula involving the unit vectors.

Alternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance is given by:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2 (hk + kl + lh) (1 - cos α) )

Wait, let's try that. So for (111), h=k=l=1:

Denominator: 3 + 2*(3)*(1 -0.866) =3 +6*(0.134) =3 +0.804=3.804.

sqrt(3.804)=1.95.

So d=10/1.95≈5.129 Angstrom. No, still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I have the wrong formula. Maybe I should use the inverse of the square root of the sum of squares of the reciprocals. Alternatively, perhaps I should use a different formula altogether.

Wait, another thought: The formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system can also be expressed using the following approach. Since all the lattice parameters are the same, a=b=c=a0, and all angles are α, the formula simplifies. From what I've read before, the formula is:

d_{hkl} = a0 / sqrt( h² +k² + l² + 2(hk + kl + lh) cos α )

Wait, but that brings us back to the same problem. Let me compute it again.

h=1, k=1, l=1, a0=10, cos α=0.866.

Denominator: 3 + 2*(3)*0.866 =3+5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

d=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstrom. But the options are much larger. So this can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a0 / sqrt( h² +k² + l² - 2 (hk + kl + lh) cos α )

Which would give:

Denominator:3 - 2*(3)*0.866 =3-5.196≈-2.196 → which is impossible.

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I should try to calculate using the volume approach.

The volume V of the rhombohedral unit cell is given by V = a^3 * sqrt(1 -3 cos^2 α + 2 cos^3 α ).

Plugging in a=10, α=30°, cos α=√3/2≈0.866.

V=10^3 * sqrt(1 -3*(0.866)^2 + 2*(0.866)^3 )

Compute inside the sqrt:

3*(0.866)^2=3*(0.75)=2.25.

2*(0.866)^3=2*(0.6495)=1.299.

So:

1 -2.25 +1.299= (1-2.25)= -1.25 +1.299=0.049.

So sqrt(0.049)=~0.2215.

Thus, V=1000 *0.2215≈221.5 Ang^3.

Now, the formula for interplanar distance using the volume is:

d = (a^3 * sqrt(1 -3 cos^2 α + 2 cos^3 α ) ) / ( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) * a^3 * sqrt(...) )^{1/2} )

Wait, that seems unclear. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula:

d = (a^3 * sqrt(1 -3 cos^2 α + 2 cos^3 α )) / ( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) * a^3 * sqrt(1 -3 cos^2 α + 2 cos^3 α ) )^{1/2} )

Wait, that's not making sense. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + kl + lh) cos α )

Wait, but that brings us back to the same issue.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using the reciprocal lattice.

In the reciprocal lattice, the reciprocal vectors are:

b1 = (2π/a)(1,1,1) / √(1+1+1 + 2(1+1+1) cos α )

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think: The reciprocal vectors are given by:

b1 = (2π/a) [ (1, 0, 0) + ... ] ?

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the reciprocal basis vectors.

The reciprocal vectors satisfy:

bi · bj = 2π δ_ij.

In a rhombohedral system, the basis vectors are a, b, c, each of length a0, with angles α between each pair.

The reciprocal vectors are given by:

b1 = (2π/a) [ (1,1,1) / (√(3(1 + 2 cos α))) ) ]

Wait, perhaps it's getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the interplanar distance is:

d = a0 / sqrt( h^2 +k^2 +l^2 - 2(hk + kl + lh) cos α )

But in our case, that gives a negative denominator, which is impossible. So perhaps I'm missing a factor or the formula is different.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a0 / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + kl + lh) cos α )

But as before, this leads to a negative value, so that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign. What if the formula is:

d = a0 / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2 (hk + kl + lh) cos α )

Which for (111) gives:

d=10 / sqrt(3 + 6 *0.866 )=10/sqrt(3+5.196)=10/sqrt(8.196)=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstrom.

But that's way too small compared to the options. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, maybe the formula actually is:

d = a0 / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) ) * sqrt( (1 - (2 cos α)/(1 + cos α) ) )

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the distance between two adjacent (111) planes.

In a cubic structure, the (111) planes are spaced at d = a / sqrt(3). So for a=10, d≈5.77 Angstrom. But in a rhombohedral structure with α=30°, the distance would be different.

But the options are around 9 Angstrom, which is larger than the cubic case. That suggests that the planes are further apart than in the cubic case, which might happen if the angle is smaller than 90°, perhaps.

Wait, another approach: The interplanar distance can be found using the formula:

(1/d)^2 = (1/a^2)(h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - (2 cos α (hk + kl + lh))/(a^2)

So,

(1/d^2) = [3 - 6 cos 30° ] / (10)^2

Compute numerator: 3 -6*(0.866)=3 -5.196= -2.196 → negative. So impossible.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think of the formula in a different way. Perhaps using the relation between the Miller indices and the plane's normal vector.

The normal vector to the (111) plane is (1,1,1). The interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes along this normal vector.

In a rhombohedral lattice, the distance between two planes can be found by projecting along the normal vector. So the interplanar distance would be the lattice parameter divided by the magnitude of the normal vector component along the lattice vectors.

But I'm not sure how to compute that. Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate the magnitude of the normal vector in the lattice.

Wait, the normal vector is (1,1,1), and in a rhombohedral lattice, each basis vector has length a0, and the angle between any two basis vectors is α=30°.

So the magnitude of the normal vector in the lattice is:

|n| = sqrt( (1)^2 + (1)^2 + (1)^2 + 2*(1)(1)cos α + 2*(1)(1)cos α + 2*(1)(1)cos α )

Wait, that's because the vectors are not orthogonal. So the magnitude squared is 1^2 +1^2 +1^2 + 2*1*1 cos α (three times, for each pair).

So,

|n|^2 =3 + 6 cos α =3 +6*(√3/2)=3 +3√3≈3+5.196=8.196.

So |n|=sqrt(8.196)≈2.863.

So the interplanar distance d would be a0 / |n| =10 /2.863≈3.49 Angstrom.

But that's again not matching the options. So I'm clearly missing something.

Wait, but the options are around 9 Angstrom. So perhaps I should consider that the formula is different, perhaps involving 1/d instead of d.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a0 * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + kl + lh) cos α )^{-1}.

Which would give the same as before, 3.49 Angstrom.

Alternatively, maybe the correct formula is:

d = a0 / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + kl + lh) cos α )

But that gives a negative denominator, which is impossible.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula has a minus sign in front of the cross terms, but that leads to a negative denominator when α is small.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a0 / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2 (hk + kl + lh) cos (180 - α) )

But cos(150°)= -sqrt(3)/2≈-0.866.

So denominator: 3 + 2*3*(-0.866) =3-5.196= -2.196 → same problem.

Hmm, I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should try to look for an alternative formula.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the interplanar distance for a rhombohedral system can be found using the formula:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) + 2(hk + kl + lh) cos α )

But again, that gives a small d.

Wait, perhaps I've mixed up the formula. Maybe the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) - 2(hk + kl + lh) cos α )

But that would make the denominator for (111) 3 - 5.196 = -2.196 → impossible.

Another possibility: Perhaps the formula is:

d_{hkl} = a0 / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2 (hk + kl + lh) cos (180 - α) )

Because the angle between vectors in the formula might be the supplementary angle. So cos(180-α)= -cos α.

So denominator becomes 3 +6 cos α → 3 +5.196=8.196.

So sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

d=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstrom. Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Maybe the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = a0 / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2 (hk + kl + lh) (1 - cos α) )

So for (111):

Denominator:3 +6*(1-0.866)=3 +6*(0.134)=3 +0.804=3.804.

sqrt(3.804)=1.95.

d=10/1.95≈5.129 Angstrom. Still not matching.

Wait, all these approaches are leading me to a d around 3-5 Angstrom, but the options are much higher. So perhaps I'm missing a key factor here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula and the correct approach is to use the inverse.

Wait, another thought: The interplanar distance is given by the reciprocal of the square root of the sum of the squares of the structure factors. No, that's not right.

Alternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance is related to the volume of the unit cell. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the miller indices and the cell.

The (111) plane intercepts the axes at 10, 10, 10. But since the axes are not orthogonal, the actual distance is different.

Wait, perhaps the distance can be found using the formula:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2 (hk + kl + lh) (1 - cos α) )

Wait, let's compute that.

h=k=l=1, a=10, cos α=0.866.

Denominator:3 + 6*(1 -0.866)=3 +6*(0.134)=3 +0.804=3.804.

sqrt(3.804)=1.95.

d=10/1.95≈5.129 Angstrom. No, same as before.

Wait, perhaps I should reconsider the approach. Maybe the formula is:

d = a0 * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + kl + lh) cos α )^{-1}

Which would give d=10 * sqrt(3 -5.196 )^{-1} → which is imaginary. No.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a0 / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2 (hk + kl + lh) cos α )

But that gives a negative denominator, so no.

I'm really stuck here. It's possible that I'm using the wrong formula. Another approach: let me search for the correct formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system.

After some quick research (just in my mind), I remember that the correct formula is:

1/d² = (h² +k² + l^2)/(a^2) - 2 (hk + kl + lh) cos α / (a²)

So,

d² = a² / [ (h² +k² + l^2) - 2 (hk + kl + lh) cos α ]

So for (111), h=k=l=1.

d² = (10)^2 / [ 3 - 6 cos 30° ]

Compute denominator:

6 cos 30°=6*(√3/2)=3√3≈5.196.

So denominator:3-5.196= -2.196.

So d²=100 / (-2.196) → negative, which is impossible. So the formula must be incorrect.

Wait, this suggests that the formula is wrong, but I can't find the correct formula. Maybe I should try a different approach. Perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a0 / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2 (hk + kl + lh) (1 - cos α) )

So denominator:3 +6*(1-0.866)=3+0.804=3.804.

sqrt(3.804)=1.95.

d=10/1.95≈5.129 Angstrom.

But again, this isn't matching the options. So perhaps I'm missing a key factor, or the question is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A) 9.08 Angstrom.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the (111) plane's interplanar distance as the same as the lattice parameter, but that's only true for (100) planes in a cubic system. But in this case, the structure is rhombohedral, so that's not applicable.

Wait, perhaps I should use the following formula: the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is given by d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) - 2 (hk + kl + lh) cos α )

But again, this gives a negative denominator.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2 (hk + kl + lh) cos α )

Which for (111) would give:

d=10/sqrt(3+5.196)=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstrom.

But the options are much larger. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1/cos α or something. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is inverted.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2 (hk + kl + lh) cos α )^{-1}

Which again would give d=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstrom.

But this doesn't match any of the options. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2 (hk + kl + lh) cos α )

But this gives a negative denominator, which can't be. So perhaps I should reconsider the problem.

Wait, perhaps I should use the reciprocal of this value. So 1/d = sqrt( denominator ) / a.

But that would make d= a / sqrt( denominator ), which again gives the same issue.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options.

Looking at the options:

A) 9.08

B) 8.95

C)9.54

D)10.05

These are all close to 9, except D which is 10.05.

Wait, in the cubic case, d=10/sqrt(3)=5.7735 Angstrom. But the options are around 9, which is bigger than a. So perhaps the interplanar distance is larger than a, which would imply that the formula has a negative denominator, but that's impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula gives d = a * sqrt( ... ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the structure. If the angles are smaller than 90°, the interplanar distance might be larger than in the cubic case.

Wait, but according to the formula I used earlier, it's smaller. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a0 / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2 (hk + kl + lh) cos α )

But then the denominator would be 3 - 5.196= -2.196 → which is negative, which can't be. So perhaps I should take the absolute value.

So d=10/sqrt(2.196)=10/1.481≈6.75 Angstrom.

Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a0 / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2 (hk + kl + lh) cos α )

Which gives d=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstrom.

But that's not matching any options.

I'm really stuck. Given that all my calculations give a d around 3-6 Angstrom, but the options are around 9 Angstrom, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate using the inverse of the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a0 * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2 (hk + kl + lh) cos α )

So for (111):

sqrt(3 +5.196)=sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

d=10 *2.863=28.63 Angstrom. No, that's way too big.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a0 * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2 (hk + kl + lh) cos α )

Which would be 10 * sqrt( -2.196 ), which is imaginary. Not possible.

Hmm, perhaps I should conclude that I'm not able to find the correct formula, but given the options, the correct answer is likely option A) 9.08 Angstrom.

But how?

Wait, another approach: Let me consider that in a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance for (111) is a / (sqrt(3) * cos (alpha/2) )

So for alpha=30°, cos(15°)=~0.9659.

So d=10/(1.732 *0.9659 )=10/(1.673)=5.979 Angstrom. Still not matching the options.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the correct formula is:

d = a0 * sqrt( (h² +k² + l^2) + 2 (hk + kl + lh) ) * cos (alpha/2 )

But that's just a guess.

So for (111):

sqrt(3 +6)=sqrt(9)=3.

d=10*3 * cos(15)=30 *0.9659≈28.98 Angstrom. No, that's way too big.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a0 / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2 (hk + kl + lh) (1 + cos α) )

Which would give:

Denominator:3 +6*(1+0.866)=3 +6*(1.866)=3+11.196=14.196.

sqrt(14.196)=3.77.

d=10/3.77≈2.65 Angstrom.

No, that's even smaller.

I'm really stuck. Given that all my attempts lead to a d around 3-6 Angstrom, but the options are around 9, perhaps the correct formula is different. Maybe I should choose the option closest to a0 * sqrt( something ) that gives around 9.

But I don't have enough information. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A)9.08.

But I'm not confident. Another approach: Perhaps the formula is:

d = a0 / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2 (hk + kl + lh) cos α )

But with the denominator being 3 -5.196= -2.196, so taking absolute value, d=10 / sqrt(2.196)=10/1.481≈6.75 Angstrom. Close to option B)8.95? No.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C)9.54 Angstrom.

But without knowing the correct formula, it's hard to choose. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using the volume approach.

The volume V= a^3 * sqrt(1 -3 cos^2 α + 2 cos^3 α )=10^3 * sqrt(1 -3*(0.75) + 2*(0.6495) )

=1000 * sqrt(1-2.25 +1.299)=1000*sqrt(0.049)=1000*0.2215=221.5 Ang^3.

The formula for the interplanar distance d is:

d = a/(sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + kl + lh)(1 - cos α) ) )

Which for (111):

Denominator inside sqrt:3 +6*(0.134)=3+0.804=3.804.

sqrt(3.804)=1.95.

d=10/1.95≈5.129 Angstrom.

Which is still not matching the options.

I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess. Since the options are around 9 Angstrom, which is close to the lattice parameter of 10, perhaps the correct answer is option A)9.08.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the interplanar distance \( d_{hkl} \) for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal, the formula used is:

\[
\frac{1}{d^2} = \frac{h^2 + k^2 + l^2}{a^2} - \frac{2(hk + kl + lh) \cos \alpha}{a^2}
\]

where \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \), \( \alpha = 30^\circ \), and \( h = k = l = 1 \) for the (111) plane. Substituting these values:

1. Compute the numerator of the first term:
   \[
   h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3
   \]

2. Compute the second term:
   \[
   2(hk + kl + lh) \cos \alpha = 2(1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1) \cos 30^\circ = 6 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 3\sqrt{3} \approx 5.196
   \]

3. Subtract the second term from the first:
   \[
   \frac{1}{d^2} = \frac{3 - 5.196}{10^2} = \frac{-2.196}{100}
   \]

The result is negative, which is physically impossible for \( d^2 \). This suggests that the formula may not be correctly applied or that the problem setup is inconsistent. Despite multiple attempts to adjust the formula, all calculations led to interplanar distances around 3–6 Å, which are far smaller than the options provided (8.95–10.05 Å).

Given the mismatch between the calculated results and the options, an educated guess is made based on the closest plausible value. The most reasonable choice, considering the lattice parameter \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \), is **Option A: 9.08 Å**.
