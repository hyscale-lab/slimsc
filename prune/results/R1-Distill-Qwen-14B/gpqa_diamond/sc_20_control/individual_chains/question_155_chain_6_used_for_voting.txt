Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again and see what it's asking.

The problem is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, ΔP_z, when the system is in a specific eigenstate of P_x. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). The matrices for P_x, P_y, and P_z are provided.

Hmm, uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So here, I need to calculate ⟨P_z²⟩ and ⟨P_z⟩, then plug them into this formula.

But wait, the state is an eigenstate of P_x, not P_z. So the expectation value of P_x in this state should be the corresponding eigenvalue. But I'm asked about P_z's uncertainty, so I have to work with P_z.

First, let me jot down the matrices given.

P_z matrix:
Row 1: [ħ, 0, 0]
Row 2: [0, 0, 0]
Row 3: [0, 0, -ħ]

So P_z is a diagonal matrix. Its diagonal elements are ħ, 0, -ħ. That makes sense; since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, each basis vector corresponds to one of these eigenvalues.

The state vector is ψ = [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]^T. Wait, let me check: the first component is -1/2, second is 1/sqrt(2), third is -1/2.

Wait, let me compute the normalization to make sure. The sum of the squares should be 1.

(-1/2)^2 = 1/4, (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2, (-1/2)^2 = 1/4. So 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = (1 + 2 + 1)/4 = 4/4 = 1. Okay, good, it's normalized.

Now, to find ⟨P_z⟩, I need to calculate (ψ)^† P_z ψ.

Since P_z is diagonal, this simplifies. Each component of ψ is multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element of P_z and then summed.

So, ψ is [ a, b, c ] where a=-1/2, b=1/sqrt(2), c=-1/2.

⟨P_z⟩ = a * (ħ) + b * 0 + c * (-ħ)
= (-1/2)ħ * 1 + 0 + (-1/2)ħ * (-1)
Wait, wait, wait. Let me compute it correctly.

Wait, no: Each component of ψ is multiplied by its corresponding P_z eigenvalue. So:

⟨P_z⟩ = (a)(ħ) + (b)(0) + (c)(-ħ)

So plugging in the values:

a = -1/2, so (a)(ħ) = (-1/2) ħ.
b is 1/sqrt(2), multiplied by 0 → 0.
c = -1/2, multiplied by -ħ → ( -1/2 )*( -ħ ) = (1/2) ħ.

So adding them up: (-1/2 ħ) + 0 + (1/2 ħ) → 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ = 0.

Hmm, that's interesting. So the expectation value is zero. That might make sense because the state might be a superposition of states with +ħ and -ħ, and the expectation cancels out.

Next, I need to find ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared will just square each diagonal element. So P_z² matrix is:

[ (ħ)^2, 0, 0 ]
[ 0, 0, 0 ]
[ 0, 0, (-ħ)^2 ]

Which simplifies to:

[ ħ², 0, 0 ]
[ 0, 0, 0 ]
[ 0, 0, ħ² ]

So calculating ⟨P_z²⟩ is similar to ⟨P_z⟩ but with this squared matrix.

⟨P_z²⟩ = a^2 * ħ² + b^2 * 0 + c^2 * ħ².

Because when you apply P_z squared to the state, each component is multiplied by (ħ)^2 or (−ħ)^2, which is ħ².

So let's compute this:

a^2 = (−1/2)^2 = 1/4 → 1/4 * ħ²
b^2 = (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2 → 1/2 * 0 = 0
c^2 = (−1/2)^2 = 1/4 → 1/4 * ħ²

Adding them up: (1/4 + 0 + 1/4) * ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ = (1/2) ħ².

Wait, but wait, the uncertainty is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ − ⟨P_z⟩^2 ). Since ⟨P_z⟩ is zero, this simplifies to sqrt( ⟨P_z²⟩ ), which would be sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) = (ħ) * sqrt(1/2) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but let me double-check. Oh, no, wait, because ⟨P_z⟩ is zero, so the uncertainty is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - 0^2) = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩). So yes, that’s sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

But wait, looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2), option C is ħ/2, etc. So the correct answer would be option B.

Wait a second, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. Let me go through the steps again.

Calculate ⟨P_z⟩:
= (−1/2)(ħ) + (1/√2)(0) + (−1/2)(−ħ)
= (−ħ/2) + 0 + (ħ/2)
= 0. Correct.

Calculate ⟨P_z²⟩:
= (−1/2)^2 (ħ²) + (1/√2)^2 * 0 + (−1/2)^2 * ħ²
= (1/4) ħ² + 0 + (1/4) ħ²
= (1/4 + 1/4) ħ²
= (1/2) ħ².

So ΔP_z = sqrt( (1/2)ħ² ) = (ħ) / sqrt(2).

Which matches option B.

Wait, but wait, the given state is an eigenstate of P_x. Does that affect anything? Because for P_z, the state is not an eigenstate, so the uncertainty should be non-zero. Which it is here. So the calculations seem correct.

To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state vector is given as:

\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The matrix for $P_z$ is diagonal with entries $(\hbar, 0, -\hbar)$. The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z \psi = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)(\hbar) + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)(0) + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)(-\hbar).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = -\frac{\hbar}{2} + 0 + \frac{\hbar}{2} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The matrix for $P_z^2$ is:

\[
P_z^2 = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z^2 \psi = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 (\hbar^2) + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 (0) + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 (\hbar^2).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 + 0 + \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Since $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$, this simplifies to:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
