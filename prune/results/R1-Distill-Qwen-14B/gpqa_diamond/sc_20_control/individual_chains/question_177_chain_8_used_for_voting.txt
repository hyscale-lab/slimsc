Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength is determined by the black body radiation curve. Then, the radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. But wait, how does that affect luminosity?

So the question is about the ratio of luminosities of Star_1 to Star_2, and the options are given as A to D, which are all around 2.2 to 2.35. Hmm. I remember that luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula is L = 4π R² σ T^4, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So the key is to find the temperatures of both stars.

Wait, the peak wavelengths are the same. Oh right, Wien's Law says that the peak wavelength λ_max is inversely proportional to the temperature. So λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. If both stars have the same λ_max, that means their temperatures are the same. Oh, wait, that can't be right. Because if they're the same temperature, then the ratio of luminosities would depend only on the radius squared. Since radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2, then L1/L2 would be (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So that would be option A, which is ~2.25.

But wait, the problem mentions radial velocities. Oh, but wait, radial velocity is about the Doppler shift. If a star is moving towards or away from us, its observed wavelength shifts. But the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, so perhaps the observed wavelengths are the same, which might affect the calculation of temperature.

Wait, let me think. If a star is moving towards us (positive radial velocity), its light is blueshifted, meaning the observed wavelength is shorter. Conversely, if moving away (negative radial velocity, but in the problem Star_2 has a higher radial velocity of 700 km/s, but wait, Star_1's radial velocity is 0. So Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s? Or towards? Wait, the problem says radial velocities are 0 and 700 for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Wait, the wording is "radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively." So Star_1's radial velocity is zero, Star_2 is 700 km/s. But which direction? Oh, wait, it's just the magnitude given. Hmm. So maybe the observed wavelength is shifted due to Doppler effect.

Wait, so when calculating the temperature of each star, we have to correct for their velocity because the observed wavelength is a combination of the intrinsic wavelength and the Doppler shift. Because the observed λ is λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ), but this is a relativistic Doppler shift formula. Alternatively, perhaps a non-relativistic approximation is (1 + v_r/c), but not sure. Wait, but v is given as 700 km/s. Let me check what the speed is compared to the speed of light. 700 km/s is 7e5 m/s. The speed of light is about 3e8 m/s, so 7e5 is 0.00233c. So non-relativistic approximation might be okay.

So for Star_2, its radial velocity is 700 km/s. Assuming that Star_2 is moving away (so v_r is positive), the observed wavelength would be longer. But the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So perhaps the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. Let's denote that observed λ_max is the same for both.

So for Star_1, because its radial velocity is zero, its observed λ_max is the same as its intrinsic λ_max. Let's denote T1 as the intrinsic temperature of Star_1. For Star_2, it's moving away, so the observed λ_max is longer. Let me denote T2 as the intrinsic temperature of Star_2.

Wait, observed λ_max = λ2_obs = λ2_emit * (1 + v_r / c), approximately. Because if it's moving away, the wavelength stretches, so λ_obs increases. But more accurately, the Doppler shift formula for wavelength is λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ), but that's when v is much less than c, perhaps we can approximate it as λ_emit (1 + v/c), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to use the non-relativistic approximation, which would be λ_obs ≈ λ_emit (1 + v_r / c). Wait, but for v_r positive (moving away), the observed λ would be larger than emitted.

Wait, but the problem states that the observed wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So λ1_obs = λ2_obs. But λ1_obs is equal to λ1_emit (since Star_1 has v_r=0). For Star_2, λ2_obs = λ2_emit * (1 + v_r / c) [approx]. So λ1_emit = λ2_emit * (1 + v_r / c).

But from Wien's law, λ_max = b / T. So λ1_emit = b / T1, λ2_emit = b / T2.

So, substituting into the previous equation:

b/T1 = [b/T2] * (1 + v_r / c)

Simplify: 1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v_r / c)

=> T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r / c )

But wait, let's think about the Doppler effect. If Star_2 is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer. So λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v_r / c). So the observed λ is larger than the emitted. Therefore, since λ1_emit = λ2_emit * (1 + v_r/c), because λ1_obs = λ2_obs, which is λ_emit for Star_1.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of temperature. Since λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature, so if the observed λ_max is the same for both, but Star_2's emitted λ_max is longer or shorter?

Wait, let me re-approach. Both stars have the same observed λ_max. Let's say λ_obs is the same for both. So:

λ_obs,1 = λ_emit,1 * Doppler shift factor for Star_1.

But Star_1 has radial velocity 0, so λ_obs,1 = λ_emit,1.

For Star_2, λ_obs,2 = λ_emit,2 * Doppler factor. Since Star_2's velocity is 700 km/s, assuming it's moving away (v_r = 700 km/s), the Doppler factor is (1 + v_r / c) ≈ (1 + 700e3 / 3e8) = 1 + 0.00233 = approximately 1.00233.

So, λ_obs,2 ≈ λ_emit,2 * 1.00233.

But since λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2, we have:

λ_emit,1 = λ_emit,2 * 1.00233.

But λ_emit is related to temperature via Wien's law: λ_emit = b / T.

So λ_emit,1 = b / T1, λ_emit,2 = b / T2.

Therefore:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * 1.00233.

Simplify:

1/T1 = (1.00233) / T2

=> T1 = T2 / 1.00233

Approximately, 1/1.00233 is about 0.99768. So T1 ≈ 0.99768 * T2.

So T2 is about 1.00233 * T1.

Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let me calculate 1.00233.

Wait, 700 km/s is 0.0007c (since c is 3e5 km/s, so 700/3e5 = 0.00233...). So 1 + v_r/c is 1.002333333.

So 1.002333333 is approximately 1.00233. So the reciprocal is roughly 0.99768.

So T1 ≈ T2 * (1/1.00233) ≈ T2 * 0.99768.

Wait, but this is a very small difference. So T2 is about 1.00233 times T1.

So, the temperatures are almost the same, but T2 is slightly higher (since it's moving away, so its emitted wavelengths are shorter than observed, but the observed λ is same as Star_1's emitted λ. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this a bit confused.

Wait, let me think again. For Star_2, which is moving away, the observed λ_max is longer than its emitted λ_max. Because when a star moves away, the wavelengths of its emitted light are stretched. So the observed λ_max for Star_2 is λ_emit * (1 + v/c) ≈ longer. But because the observed λ_max of Star_2 must be the same as Star_1's observed λ_max, which is λ_emit,1. So:

λ_emit,1 = λ_emit,2 * (1 + v/c)

But λ_emit = b / T. So:

b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v/c)

Simplify: 1/T1 = (1 + v/c)/T2

=> T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c)

So T2 is larger than T1. So the temperature of Star_2 is higher than that of Star_1.

Wait, that's a crucial point. So T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r/c).

Wait, but the problem says Star_1's radial velocity is 0, so Star_2's is moving away at 700 km/s.

So, what's the ratio of luminosities?

Luminosity L = 4π R² σ T^4.

So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

We know R1 = 1.5 R2, so (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

But T1 and T2 are related via the Doppler effect. As established earlier, T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c), approximately. So T2 is larger.

Wait, but this would mean that T1 is lower than T2. Because T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c), so T1 = T2 / (1 + v/c).

Wait, no. Let's correct this.

From the equation:

λ_emit,1 = λ_emit,2 * (1 + v/c)

But λ_emit,1 = b / T1 and λ_emit,2 = b / T2.

So, substituting:

b/T1 = (b/T2) (1 + v/c)

=> 1/T1 = (1 + v/c) * (1/T2)

=> T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c)

So T2 is bigger than T1.

So T1 / T2 = 1 / (1 + v/c)

So (T1/T2)^4 = [1/(1 + v/c)]^4.

So putting it all together:

L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * [1/(1 + v/c)]^4.

Wait, but let's compute 1 + v/c.

v = 700e3 m/s.

c is 3e8 m/s.

v/c = 7e5 / 3e8 ≈ 0.0023333.

So 1 + v/c ≈ 1.0023333.

So [1/(1.0023333)]^4.

Let me compute 1.0023333 to the fourth power.

Wait, 1.0023333^4 is approximately:

We can approximate (1 + x)^n ≈ 1 + n x, for small x.

Here x = 0.0023333, n=4.

So (1.0023333)^4 ≈ 1 + 4 * 0.0023333 ≈ 1.0093333.

But that's an approximation. Let me compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, compute it step by step:

1.0023333^2 = (1 + 0.0023333)^2 = 1 + 2*0.0023333 + (0.0023333)^2.

Which is 1 + 0.0046666 + 0.000005444 ≈ 1.00467204.

Then, (1.00467204)^2 = ?

Calculating 1.00467204 * 1.00467204:

Approximately:

1 * 1 = 1.

1 * 0.00467204 = 0.00467204

0.00467204 * 1 = 0.00467204

0.00467204 * 0.00467204 ≈ ~0.0000218.

Adding all up:

1 + 0.00467204 + 0.00467204 + 0.0000218 ≈ 1.0093659.

So (1.0023333)^4 ≈ 1.0093659.

Therefore, [1/(1.0023333)]^4 ≈ 1 / 1.0093659 ≈ 0.99074.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, [1/(1 + v/c)]^4 = [1/(1.002333)]^4.

Which is the reciprocal of (1.002333)^4 which is ≈1.0093659.

So 1.0093659 inverse is approximately 0.99074.

So (T1/T2)^4 = [1/(1.002333)]^4 ≈ 0.99074.

So now, putting it all together:

L1/L2 = (2.25) * (0.99074) ≈ 2.25 * 0.99074 ≈ 2.227.

Wait, that's roughly 2.227. Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23, which would be about that.

But wait, let me double-check because I might have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, the luminosity ratio is (R1/R2)^2 multiplied by (T1/T2)^4.

We have R1/R2 = 1.5, so squared is 2.25.

T1/T2 = 1/(1 + v/c) ≈ 1/1.002333 ≈0.99767.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ (0.99767)^4.

Wait, 0.99767^2 is approximately (1 - 0.00233)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.00233 + (0.00233)^2 ≈ 0.99534 + 0.0000054 ≈ 0.995345.

Then, 0.995345 squared: (approx)

0.995345 * 0.995345.

Let me compute:

(1 - 0.004655)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.004655 + (0.004655)^2.

Which is 1 - 0.00931 + 0.00002167 ≈ 0.9906917.

So (0.99767)^4 ≈ 0.99069.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.99069 ≈ 2.25 * 0.99069.

Let me compute 2.25 * 0.99069.

2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275.

2.25 * 0.00069 ≈ 0.0015525.

So total is approximately 2.2275 + 0.0015525 ≈ 2.229.

So approximately 2.229. Which is about 2.23, which is option D.

But wait, why did I think earlier that the answer is 2.25? Because when I first considered that the temperatures are the same, we'd get L1/L2=2.25, but here it's a bit less, 2.23.

So the correct answer would be D) ~2.23.

But wait, perhaps I should consider more accurate calculations.

Let me compute 1.00233334 to the 4th power precisely.

Let me compute 1.002333333^4:

Let me compute step by step.

Compute 1.002333333^2:

= (1 + 0.002333333)^2

= 1 + 2*0.002333333 + (0.002333333)^2

= 1 + 0.004666666 + 0.000005444

= 1.00467211.

Now, square that result: 1.00467211^2.

Compute:

= (1 + 0.00467211)^2

= 1 + 2*(0.00467211) + (0.00467211)^2

= 1 + 0.00934422 + 0.000021828

= 1.009366048.

So (1.002333333)^4 ≈ 1.009366048.

So 1.009366048 is (1 + v/c)^4.

So [1/(1 + v/c)]^4 = 1/(1.009366048) ≈ 0.990719.

So then, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.990719 ≈ 2.25 * 0.990719.

2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275.

2.25 * 0.000719 = 0.00161025.

Adding together: 2.2275 + 0.00161025 ≈ 2.22911.

So approximately 2.229, which is around 2.23, so option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the Doppler shift formula without considering relativistic effects, which would be the same as the approach we took.

So the correct answer is D) ~2.23.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of luminosities \( L_1 / L_2 \) between Star_1 and Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

The luminosity ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

### Step 1: Radius Ratio
The problem states that \( R_1 = 1.5 \, R_2 \). Thus:

\[
\left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]

### Step 2: Temperature Ratio
The stars are observed to have the same peak wavelength \( \lambda_{\text{max, obs}} \), which implies their intrinsic temperatures are related through the Doppler shift due to Star_2's radial velocity \( v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s} \). Using the relativistic Doppler shift formula for wavelength:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{emit}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_r/c}{1 - v_r/c}}
\]

For small velocities (\( v_r \ll c \)), this simplifies to:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} \approx \lambda_{\text{emit}} (1 + v_r/c)
\]

Since \( \lambda_{\text{max}} \propto 1/T \) (Wien's law), the intrinsic wavelengths are related as:

\[
\lambda_{\text{emit,1}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} (1 + v_r/c)
\]

Substituting \( \lambda_{\text{emit}} = b / T \), where \( b \) is Wien's displacement constant:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1 + v_r/c}
\]

The radial velocity \( v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s} \) corresponds to \( v_r/c = 700 / 300,000 = 0.00233 \). Thus:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1 + 0.00233} \approx \frac{1}{1.00233} \approx 0.99768
\]

### Step 3: Temperature Ratio to the Fourth Power
The temperature ratio to the fourth power is:

\[
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = (0.99768)^4
\]

Using the approximation \( (1 - x)^n \approx 1 - nx \) for small \( x \), where \( x = 1 - 0.99768 = 0.00232 \):

\[
(0.99768)^4 \approx 1 - 4(0.00232) = 1 - 0.00928 = 0.99072
\]

### Step 4: Luminosity Ratio
Substituting into the luminosity ratio formula:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (2.25) \times (0.99072) \approx 2.229
\]

### Final Answer
The calculated luminosity ratio \( L_1 / L_2 \) is approximately \( 2.23 \), which corresponds to option **D**.

Answer: D
