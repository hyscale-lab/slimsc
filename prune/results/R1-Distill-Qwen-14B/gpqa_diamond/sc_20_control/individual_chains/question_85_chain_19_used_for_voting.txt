Okay, I've got this astronomy problem here about two planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm. Let me try to work through it step by step.

So the problem states that two planets are orbiting a star, and they've been detected using both the transit and radial velocity methods. The star's parameters are given: mass is 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. 

Planet1 has 7 Earth masses and a radius of 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses with a radius of 1.3 Earth radii. Both orbits are circular. 

The question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. The options are A to D, with some numbers.

Wait, equilibrium temperature—right, that's the temperature a planet would have if it were in thermal equilibrium, considering the incoming stellar radiation and its own outgoing radiation. It depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Oh, and the problem says both planets have the same albedo, so that factor is out. So the ratio will depend on the star's luminosity, their distances, and any other factors like greenhouse effects, but I think we can ignore that for this problem.

The formula for equilibrium temperature is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) * ( (L_star / L_sun) / (D^2) )^(1/4) Wait, maybe I should think more clearly.

Alternatively, the equilibrium temperature formula is T_p = T_* * sqrt(R_*/(2a)) * sqrt( (1 - a_p) ) to the 1/4th? Or wait, perhaps I got that wrong. Let me recall. The equilibrium temperature is determined by the balance between absorbed stellar radiation and emitted thermal radiation.

The formula is: T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - a) )^(1/4) ), where 'a' is the planet's orbital distance. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Another way: The flux from the star at the planet's distance is F = L_star/(4πa²). The planet absorbs (1 - a) * F, and re-radiates as a blackbody: σ T_eq^4 = (1 - a) F /4. Because the planet's cross-section is π R_p^2, but the surface area is 4π R_p², so the energy balance is (L*(1 - a))/(4π a²) * (π R_p^2)/(4 σ R_p^2) )? Wait, maybe I should think differently.

Alternatively, the planet's equilibrium temperature is given by:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - a) )^(1/4 )

Wait, I think that's correct. Because the star's flux at distance a is F = L/(4π a²). But L = 4π R_star² σ T_star^4. So F = (R_star^2 T_star^4) / a².

The planet's energy balance is that the absorbed power (F * π R_p^2 * (1 - a)) equals the emitted power (4π R_p^2 σ T_eq^4). So:

F * π R_p^2 (1 - a) = 4 π R_p^2 σ T_eq^4

Cancel π R_p^2:

F (1 - a) = 4 σ T_eq^4

Substitute F:

(R_star^2 T_star^4 / a²) (1 - a) = 4 σ T_eq^4

Divide both sides by 4 σ:

(R_star^2 T_star^4 (1 - a)) / (4 σ a²) ) = T_eq^4

Take the fourth root:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - a) )^(1/4 )

Wait, but wait. The (1 - a) comes from the planet's albedo. Since both planets have the same albedo, that term will cancel out when taking the ratio.

So the equilibrium temperature ratio (T1/T2) would be sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2/a1 )

Because the other terms (T_star and albedo) are same for both.

So, T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

But wait, I need to make sure that the formula is correct. Let me see: the formula for T_eq is proportional to sqrt( R_star/(a) ) * sqrt( (1 - a_alb)^(1/4) ), but since albedo is same, (1 - a) is same for both planets. So when taking the ratio T1/T2, the (1 - a) terms, which are same, cancel out.

So the ratio is sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Wait, because R_star/(2a1) in the numerator for T1, and R_star/(2a2) in the denominator for T2. So when you take (T1/T2)^2 = (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) = (a2)/(a1). Therefore, T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 )

So I need to find the ratio a2/a1, then take the square root.

But wait, how do I find a1 and a2, the orbital distances of the two planets?

The problem gives information about the RV method. The RV method measures the Doppler shift, which is related to the planet's mass and its distance from the star.

In the radial velocity method, the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_* )^(1/3) ) )

But since both planets are detected via RV, and the star's mass is much larger than the planets, M_* >> M_p, so 1 + M_p/M_* ≈ 1. So K ≈ ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3) )

But I think another approach is to relate the RV semi-amplitude to the orbital distance. The RV semi-amplitude K is related to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit.

The RV semi-amplitude K can also be approximated as:

K = (v) = ( (27π G ) / (2 c) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / (1 + M_p/M_* )^(1/3) )

But again, M_p << M_*, so this simplifies, but perhaps a better approach is to use the relation between the RV semi-amplitude and the orbital distance.

The radial velocity method gives a semi-amplitude K, which is the maximum velocity of the star towards/away from us. The formula for K is:

K = ( (G P ) / (2 pi c^3) )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( M_*^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_* )^(1/3) )

But perhaps another way is to use the formula that relates the RV semi-amplitude to the orbital period and distance.

Wait, perhaps it's more straightforward to think in terms of the Doppler shift. The problem states that the star's forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å experiences a shift of 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2.

Doppler shift (Δλ/λ) is given by:

Δλ / λ = v / c

But since the shifts are periodic, it's the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. So for each planet, the RV semi-amplitude K is equal to v = (Δλ/λ) * c.

Wait, wait. The Doppler shift formula is Δλ/λ = v/c, where v is the velocity of the star towards or away from us. So for each planet, the maximum shift is given, which corresponds to the semi-amplitude K.

So for Planet1: K1 = (Δλ1 / λ) * c = (0.03e-4) * 3e8 m/s.

Wait, Δλ is 0.03 Å, and λ is 6300 Å.

So Δλ/λ = 0.03 / 6300 = 3e-6.

So K1 = 3e-6 * c.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So K1 = 3e-6 * 3e8 = 9e2 m/s. Wait, that's 900 m/s? That seems way too high. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, 0.03 Å is 3e-8 meters, and 6300 Å is 6300e-10 meters. So λ = 6300e-10 m.

Wait, Δλ/λ = (3e-8 m) / (6300e-10 m) ) = (3e-8) / (6.3e-7) ) = (3 / 6.3 ) * 1e-1 = approx 0.476 * 0.1 = 0.0476.

So approximately 0.0476, which is 4.76e-2.

Then K1 = (Δλ/λ)*c = 0.0476 * 3e8 m/s = 1.428e7 m/s? That's 14,280 km/s. Wait, that can't be right because stars don't move that fast. So I must have messed up the units.

Wait, wait. The Doppler shift formula is often expressed as (Δλ / λ) = v/c, where v is the velocity. But the units must be consistent.

Δλ is 0.03 Å, which is 0.03e-10 meters. λ is 6300 Å, which is 6300e-10 meters.

So Δλ/λ = 0.03e-10 / 6300e-10 = 0.03 / 6300 = 3e-6.

So v = c * (Δλ/λ) = (3e8 m/s) * 3e-6 = 900 m/s.

Ah, okay, that makes sense. So K1 is 900 m/s.

Similarly for Planet2: Δλ is 0.04 Å.

Δλ/λ = 0.04 / 6300 = 4e-5 / 6300? Wait, no, 0.04 / 6300 = 4e-5 / 6.3e3 = 4/(6.3e5) ) ≈ 6.33e-6.

Wait, wait, 0.04 / 6300 = 4e-2 / 6.3e3 = (4 / 6.3) ) * 1e-5 ≈ 0.633 * 1e-5 = 6.33e-6.

So K2 = 3e8 m/s * 6.33e-6 ≈ 1.9e3 m/s, approximately 1900 m/s.

Wait, but wait, the question says that Planet1 induces a shift of up to 0.03 Å, and Planet2 induces a shift of up to 0.04 Å. So K1 is 0.03 /6300 * c, K2 is 0.04 /6300 * c.

So:

K1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c = 3e-6 c.

K2 = (0.04 / 6300) * c = (4e-6) c.

Wait, no, because 0.03 is 3e-2, 6300 is 6.3e3. So 3e-2 /6.3e3 = 3/(6.3e5) ) = approx 4.76e-6.

Wait, no. Let me recompute correctly.

For Planet1:

Δλ = 0.03 Å = 3e-8 m

λ = 6300 Å = 6300e-10 m = 6.3e-7 m.

Δλ/λ = (3e-8) / (6.3e-7) ) = (3 / 630 ) )e-1 = (0.0047619) e-1 = 4.7619e-5.

Wait, wait: 3e-8 /6.3e-7 = (3/6.3) * (1e-8 / 1e-7 ) = (0.47619) * 0.1 = 0.047619. So 4.7619e-2.

So K1 = c * Δλ/λ = 3e8 m/s * 4.7619e-2.

Which is 3e8 * 0.047619 ≈ 1.42857e7 m/s, which is 14,285.7 m/s. But that can't be right because I've heard that RV velocities for planets are usually in the 10s of m/s, not thousands. I must have messed up the exponents.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in converting angstroms to meters. Let me double-check.

1 angstrom (Å) is 1e-10 meters.

So 0.03 Å is 0.03 * 1e-10 m = 3e-12 m.

6300 Å is 6300 * 1e-10 m = 6.3e-7 m.

So Δλ/λ = (3e-12) / (6.3e-7) ) = (3 / 6.3 ) * 1e-5 ≈ 0.476 * 1e-5 = 4.76e-6.

So K1 = c * Δλ/λ = 3e8 m/s * 4.76e-6 ≈ 1.428e3 m/s, which is 1428 m/s.

Similarly, Planet2 has Δλ=0.04 Å.

Δλ = 0.04e-10 m =4e-12 m.

Δλ/λ =4e-12 /6.3e-7= (4/6.3) * 1e-5 ≈ 0.633 * 1e-5 =6.33e-6.

K2 =3e8 *6.33e-6≈1.899e3 m/s≈1899 m/s.

So K1 is about 1428 m/s, K2 is about 1900 m/s.

But I'm a bit confused because these velocities seem high, but perhaps it's correct for very massive planets or tight orbits.

Now, the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet and the distance of the planet from the star. The formula for K is:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_* + M_p )^(1/3} (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ) * ( sin i ) / ( (P/(2π))^(1/3) * (1 + M_p/M_* )^(2/3) )

Wait, perhaps a better formula is K = (v) = ( (2 pi G ) / (c P ) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i ) / ( (M_* )^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_* )^(1/3) )

Since M_* >> M_p, the (1 + M_p/M_* ) term is approximately 1.

So K ≈ ( (2 pi G ) / (c P ) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i ) / (M_*^(2/3) )

Rearranging, we can write:

K³ ≈ (2 pi G) / (c³ P) ) * ( M_p³ sin³i ) / (M_*² )

But I'm not sure if this is the way to go. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider that for a circular orbit (e=0), the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_* + M_p )^(1/3} ) ) )^(1/1) ) * ( sin i ) / ( ( (P/(2 pi)) (1 + M_p/M_* ) )^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's think about the relation between the semi-amplitude K and the orbital distance a.

The RV method gives the semi-amplitude K, which is the star's velocity. The velocity of the star is related to the planet's velocity via the mass ratio.

Since the star and planet orbit their common center of mass, the star's velocity v_* is related to the planet's velocity v_p by v_* = (M_p / M_*) v_p.

The orbital velocity of the planet is v_p = 2π a / P.

Similarly, the star's velocity is v_* = 2π a_* / P, where a_* is the star's orbit around the barycenter.

But a_* = (M_p / (M_* + M_p)) a ≈ (M_p / M_*) a, since M_* >> M_p.

So v_* = (M_p / M_*) * v_p = (M_p / M_*) (2π a / P )

But v_* is also K, the RV semi-amplitude.

So K = (2 π G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i ) / ( (M_* )^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_* )^(1/3) ) * (1/(P^(1/3)) )

But this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to use the formula that relates K to the orbital period and the planet's mass.

Alternatively, perhaps the radial velocity semi-amplitude K can be expressed as:

K = ( (27 π G ) / (2 c^3) )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_* )^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_* )^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / (1 - e²)^(1/2) )

But since e=0 (circular orbit), the denominator becomes 1.

Given that, perhaps I can express the ratio of K1 and K2 in terms of the planet masses and orbital periods. But I don't have the periods, so maybe I need another approach.

Wait, but for a circular orbit, the semi-major axis a is related to the orbital period P via Kepler's third law.

Kepler's third law is:

P² = (4 π² a³) / ( G (M_* + M_p) )

Again, since M_* >> M_p, it simplifies to P² = (4 π² a³ ) / ( G M_* )

So, a³ = G M_* P² / (4 π² )

So, a = [ (G M_* P² )/(4 π²) ]^(1/3 )

But without knowing P, this might not help directly.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find a relation between K and a.

From the expression for K, which involves a.

Wait, let's try combining K and a.

From K = (2 pi G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i ) / ( ( M_*^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_* )^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

And from Kepler's law, P² = (4 π² a³ )/( G M_* )

So, P = ( (4 π² a³ )/( G M_* ) )^(1/2 )

Substituting P into the K equation:

K = (2 pi G )^(1/3) * (M_p ) / ( M_*^(2/3) ) * (1 / [ (4 π² a³ )/( G M_* ) )^(1/2 ) ] )^(1/3 )

Wait, perhaps that's getting too messy. Let me try substituting P in terms of a.

P = ( (4 π² a³ )/( G M_* ) )^(1/2 )

So, 1/P = [ (G M_* )/(4 π² a³ ) ]^(1/2 )

Then 1/P^(1/3 ) = [ (G M_* )/(4 π² a³ ) ]^(1/6 )

Putting back into K:

K = (2 pi G )^(1/3) * ( M_p ) / ( M_*^(2/3) ) * [ (G M_* )/(4 pi² a³ ) ]^(1/6 ) / ( (1 + M_p/M_* )^(1/3) )

Simplify exponents:

= [2 pi G]^(1/3) * [G M_* ]^(1/6) / [4 pi² a³ ]^(1/6) ) * M_p / M_*^(2/3) ) / ( (1 + M_p/M_* )^(1/3) )

Let me compute each term:

[2 pi G]^(1/3) * [G M_* ]^(1/6) = (2 pi)^(1/3) * G^(1/3) * G^(1/6) * M_*^(1/6) )

= (2 pi)^(1/3) * G^(1/3 + 1/6) * M_*^(1/6)

= (2 pi)^(1/3) * G^(1/2) * M_*^(1/6)

Similarly, denominator terms:

[4 pi² a³ ]^(1/6) = (4)^(1/6) (pi^2)^(1/6) a^(0.5)

= 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3) a^(0.5)

Putting it together:

K = [ (2 pi)^(1/3) G^(1/2) M_*^(1/6) ) / ( 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3) a^(0.5) ) ) ] * ( M_p ) / ( M_*^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_* )^(1/3) )

Simplify the fractions:

2 pi in numerator and 2 in denominator:

(2 pi)^(1/3) / 2^(1/3) ) = pi^(1/3)

Similarly, G^(1/2) remains.

M_*^(1/6) / M_*^(2/3) ) = M_*^( (1/6 - 4/6) ) = M_*^(-3/6) = M_*^(-1/2)

So now:

K = [ pi^(1/3) G^(1/2) M_*^(-1/2) ) / ( pi^(1/3) a^(0.5) ) ) ] * ( M_p ) / ( (1 + M_p/M_* )^(1/3) )

Simplify pi^(1/3) cancels.

So:

K = [ G^(1/2) M_*^(-1/2) ) / a^(0.5) ] * ( M_p ) / ( (1 + M_p/M_* )^(1/3) )

Which simplifies to:

K = ( G^(1/2) M_p ) / ( M_*^(1/2) a^(0.5) (1 + M_p/M_* )^(1/3) )

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. But perhaps we can make some approximations.

Given that M_* >> M_p, 1 + M_p/M_* ≈ 1, so (1 + M_p/M_* )^(1/3) ≈ 1.

So, K ≈ ( G^(1/2) M_p ) / ( M_*^(1/2) a^(0.5) )

Rearranged, that's:

K = ( G M_p )^(1/2) / ( M_*^(1/2) a^(1/2) )

Square both sides:

K² = ( G M_p ) / ( M_* a )

Multiply both sides by a:

K² a = G M_p / M_*

So,

a = (G M_p ) / ( M_* K² )

Wait, that seems manageable.

So, a is proportional to (M_p )/( K² )

Wait, but let me check the units. G has units [m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²], M_p in kg, M_* in kg, K in m/s.

So,

a = ( G M_p ) / ( M_* K² )

Units: [m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²] * [kg] / [kg * (m²/s²) ] = [m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻² * kg ] / [ kg m²/s² ]

Wait, numerator: G M_p → m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻² * kg = m³ s⁻².

Denominator: M_* K² → kg * (m²/s²) ) → kg m²/s².

So overall: (m³ s⁻² ) / ( kg m²/s² ) ) → (m³ s⁻² * s² ) ) / ( kg m² ) → m / kg.

Hmm, that doesn't make sense. So perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra.

Wait, let me rederive a in terms of K.

We have K ≈ ( G^(1/2) M_p ) / ( ( M_* a )^(1/2) )

So, square both sides: K² = ( G M_p ) / ( M_* a )

Multiply both sides by a: K² a = ( G M_p ) / M_*

Then,

a = ( G M_p ) / ( M_* K² )

But the units here: G has [m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²], M_p [kg], M_* [kg], K [m/s].

So numerator: G M_p → m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻² * kg = m³ s⁻².

Denominator: M_* K² → kg * (m²/s²) ) = kg m²/s².

So a = (m³ s⁻² ) / ( kg m²/s² ) ) → m / kg.

Wait, that can't be right because 'a' should have units of meters. So I must have messed up the algebra.

Wait, perhaps let me re-express from K² = (G M_p )/( M_* a )

So,

a = (G M_p )/( M_* K² )

Let me check the units:

G → m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻².

M_p → kg.

M_* → kg.

K → m/s → (m/s)^2 = m²/s².

So,

G M_p → m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻² * kg = m³ s⁻².

M_* K² → kg * m²/s².

So,

a = (m³ s⁻²) / ( kg m²/s² ) ) → (m³ s⁻² * s²) ) / ( kg m² ) → m / kg.

Which is still not right. So I must have messed up the derivation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have taken the earlier expression:

K = (2 pi G )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( ( M_*^(2/3) ) (1 + M_p/M_* )^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / ( P^(1/3) ) )

And since I don't know sin i (inclination), but perhaps it's the same for both planets, so when taking the ratio, it cancels.

But let's think: since both planets are in the same system, we can assume the same inclination angle, so sin i is the same for both.

So, let's denote K1 and K2 as the semi-amplitudes for Planet1 and Planet2.

So,

K1 = (2 pi G )^(1/3) * ( M1 sin i ) / ( M_*^(2/3) (1 + M1/M_* )^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / P1^(1/3) )

Similarly,

K2 = (2 pi G )^(1/3) * ( M2 sin i ) / ( M_*^(2/3) (1 + M2/M_* )^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / P2^(1/3) )

Taking the ratio K1/K2:

K1/K2 = [ M1 / M2 ] * [ (1 + M2/M_* )^(1/3) / (1 + M1/M_* )^(1/3) ) ] * [ P2^(1/3) / P1^(1/3) ]

But since M_* >> M1 and M2, (1 + M_p/M_* ) ≈ 1. So the terms in brackets involving (1 + ...) can be approximated as 1.

So,

K1/K2 ≈ ( M1 / M2 ) * ( P2^(1/3) / P1^(1/3) )

But from Kepler's third law, since a^3 ∝ P² (because P² = (4 pi² a^3)/( G M_* ) )

So, P1/P2 = ( a1^3 / a2^3 )^(1/2 ) ) = ( a1/a2 )^(3/2 )

Wait, Wait, no. Kepler's law is P² = (4 pi² a^3 )/( G M_* )

So,

P1² / P2² = ( a1^3 ) / ( a2^3 )

Take square roots:

P1 / P2 = ( a1^3 / a2^3 )^(1/2 ) = ( a1/a2 )^(3/2 )

So,

(P2^(1/3) ) / ( P1^(1/3) ) ) = ( P2 / P1 )^(1/3 ) = [ (a2^3 / a1^3 )^(1/2) ) ]^(1/3 )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to express P1 in terms of a1 and P2 in terms of a2.

Wait, for Kepler's law:

P1² = (4 pi² a1^3 )/( G M_* )

P2² = (4 pi² a2^3 )/( G M_* )

Taking the ratio:

(P1²)/(P2²) = (a1^3)/(a2^3 )

So,

P1/P2 = (a1/a2 )^(3/2 )

So,

(P2/P1 ) = (a2/a1 )^(3/2 )

So,

(P2^(1/3) ) / ( P1^(1/3) ) ) = ( (P2 / P1 ) )^(1/3 ) = [ (a2/a1 )^(3/2) ) ]^(1/3 ) = (a2/a1 )^( 1/2 )

So, putting this back into the ratio K1/K2:

K1/K2 ≈ ( M1 / M2 ) * ( a2/a1 )^(1/2 )

But we have K1 and K2 measured, so let's plug in the numbers.

We have K1 = 1428 m/s (from Planet1's shift)

K2 = 1899 m/s (from Planet2's shift)

So,

K1/K2 = 1428 / 1899 ≈ 0.752.

Then,

0.752 ≈ ( M1 / M2 ) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

We know M1 =7 Earth masses, M2=5 Earth masses.

So,

M1/M2=7/5=1.4.

So,

0.752 ≈ 1.4 * sqrt( a2/a1 )

Divide both sides by 1.4:

0.752 /1.4 ≈ sqrt( a2/a1 )

0.752 /1.4 ≈ 0.537.

So,

sqrt( a2/a1 ) ≈ 0.537 → a2/a1 ≈ (0.537)^2 ≈ 0.288.

So,

a2 ≈ 0.288 a1.

Wait, but wait, the ratio K1/K2 is about 0.752, so K1 is smaller than K2. So, with M1 > M2, the ratio (M1/M2) is 1.4, and (a2/a1 )^0.5 is about 0.537.

So, a2 is about 0.288 times a1. So a1 is larger than a2.

Wait, but that implies that Planet1 is further away from the star than Planet2. That makes sense, because a higher mass planet would cause a larger K (if a is the same), but in this case, K2 is larger than K1. So, if M2 < M1, but K2 > K1, that suggests that a2 must be smaller than a1, because K depends on both mass and a.

Wait, but according to our ratio, a2 is about 0.288 a1. So, a1 is larger than a2. So Planet1 is further out.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me recap.

We have:

K1/K2 ≈ ( M1 / M2 ) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

We have K1=1428 m/s, K2=1900 m/s.

So K1/K2 = 1428 / 1900 ≈ 0.7516.

So,

0.7516 = (7/5) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

7/5 is 1.4.

So,

0.7516 /1.4 = sqrt( a2/a1 )

0.7516 /1.4 ≈ 0.537.

So,

sqrt( a2/a1 ) = 0.537 → a2/a1 = (0.537)^2 ≈ 0.288.

So a2 ≈ 0.288 a1.

So, the ratio a2/a1 is approximately 0.288.

Remember, earlier, the equilibrium temperature ratio is T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 )

So,

T1/T2 = sqrt( 0.288 ) ≈ 0.537.

So approximately 0.537, which is about 0.54. Looking at the options, option C is ~0.53, which is close.

Wait, but let me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Another way: the formula I derived earlier was T_eq = T_* * sqrt( R_* / (2a) ) * ( (1 - a) )^(1/4 )

So, the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( ( R_* / (2a1) ) / ( R_* / (2a2) ) ) ) * ( (1 - a1) / (1 - a2) )^(1/4 )

But since both have same albedo, (1 - a1)=(1 -a2), so that term becomes 1. So ratio is sqrt( a2/(a1) )

Which is what I used earlier.

So, yes, the ratio is sqrt( a2/a1 ) ≈ sqrt(0.288) ≈ 0.537.

So the equilibrium temperature of Planet1 is about 0.537 times that of Planet2.

So the ratio T1/T2 is ~0.537, which is approximately 0.54, so option C is ~0.53.

To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we use the equilibrium temperature formula:

\[
T_{\text{eq}} = T_* \sqrt{\frac{R_*}{2a}} \left(1 - a_p\right)^{1/4}
\]

where \(T_*\) is the star's effective temperature, \(R_*\) is the star's radius, \(a\) is the planet's orbital distance, and \(a_p\) is the planet's albedo. Since both planets have the same albedo (\(a_p\)), the \((1 - a_p)^{1/4}\) term cancels out when taking the ratio. Thus, the equilibrium temperature ratio is:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

To find \(a_1\) and \(a_2\), we use the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude \(K\), which is related to the orbital distance \(a\) and the planet's mass \(M_p\). The RV semi-amplitude is given by:

\[
K = \frac{(G M_p \sin i)}{(M_*^{2/3} a^{1/2})}
\]

For circular orbits (\(e = 0\)) and assuming the same inclination (\(\sin i \approx 1\)), the ratio of the semi-amplitudes \(K_1\) and \(K_2\) is:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{M_1}{M_2} \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Rearranging for \(\sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}\):

\[
\sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \frac{K_1}{K_2} \cdot \frac{M_2}{M_1}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \(K_1\) and \(K_2\)
The Doppler shift provides the semi-amplitudes:
- For Planet1: \(\Delta \lambda / \lambda = 0.03 / 6300 = 4.76 \times 10^{-6}\), so \(K_1 = c \cdot (\Delta \lambda / \lambda) = 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 4.76 \times 10^{-6} = 1428 \, \text{m/s}\).
- For Planet2: \(\Delta \lambda / \lambda = 0.04 / 6300 = 6.33 \times 10^{-6}\), so \(K_2 = c \cdot (\Delta \lambda / \lambda) = 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 6.33 \times 10^{-6} = 1900 \, \text{m/s}\).

### Step 2: Compute the ratio \(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\)
\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{1428}{1900} \approx 0.752
\]

### Step 3: Compute \(\sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}\)
The masses of the planets are \(M_1 = 7 \, M_\oplus\) and \(M_2 = 5 \, M_\oplus\), so:

\[
\frac{M_2}{M_1} = \frac{5}{7} \approx 0.714
\]

Substitute into the formula:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \frac{K_1}{K_2} \cdot \frac{M_2}{M_1} = 0.752 \cdot 0.714 \approx 0.537
\]

### Step 4: Compute the equilibrium temperature ratio
The equilibrium temperature ratio is:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} \approx 0.537
\]

### Final Answer:
The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately \(0.53\), which corresponds to **Option C**.

Answer: C

--- Full Content ---
Okay, I've got this astronomy problem here about two planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm. Let me try to work through it step by step.

So the problem states that two planets are orbiting a star, and they've been detected using both the transit and radial velocity methods. The star's parameters are given: mass is 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. 

Planet1 has 7 Earth masses and a radius of 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses with a radius of 1.3 Earth radii. Both orbits are circular. 

The question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. The options are A to D, with some numbers.

Wait, equilibrium temperature—right, that's the temperature a planet would have if it were in thermal equilibrium, considering the incoming stellar radiation and its own outgoing radiation. It depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Oh, and the problem says both planets have the same albedo, so that factor is out. So the ratio will depend on the star's luminosity, their distances, and any other factors like greenhouse effects, but I think we can ignore that for this problem.

The formula for equilibrium temperature is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) * ( (L_star / L_sun) / (D^2) )^(1/4) Wait, maybe I should think more clearly.

Alternatively, the equilibrium temperature formula is T_p = T_* * sqrt(R_*/(2a)) * sqrt( (1 - a_p) ) to the 1/4th? Or wait, perhaps I got that wrong. Let me recall. The equilibrium temperature is determined by the balance between absorbed stellar radiation and emitted thermal radiation.

The formula is: T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - a) )^(1/4) ), where 'a' is the planet's orbital distance. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Another way: The flux from the star at the planet's distance is F = L_star/(4πa²). The planet absorbs (1 - a) * F, and re-radiates as a blackbody: σ T_eq^4 = (1 - a) F /4. Because the planet's cross-section is π R_p^2, but the surface area is 4π R_p², so the energy balance is (L*(1 - a))/(4π a²) * (π R_p^2)/(4 σ R_p^2) )? Wait, maybe I should think differently.

Alternatively, the planet's equilibrium temperature is given by:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - a) )^(1/4 )

Wait, I think that's correct. Because the star's flux at distance a is F = L/(4π a²). But L = 4π R_star² σ T_star^4. So F = (R_star^2 T_star^4) / a².

The planet's energy balance is that the absorbed power (F * π R_p^2 * (1 - a)) equals the emitted power (4π R_p^2 σ T_eq^4). So:

F * π R_p^2 (1 - a) = 4 π R_p^2 σ T_eq^4

Cancel π R_p^2:

F (1 - a) = 4 σ T_eq^4

Substitute F:

(R_star^2 T_star^4 / a²) (1 - a) = 4 σ T_eq^4

Divide both sides by 4 σ:

(R_star^2 T_star^4 (1 - a)) / (4 σ a²) ) = T_eq^4

Take the fourth root:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - a) )^(1/4 )

Wait, but wait. The (1 - a) comes from the planet's albedo. Since both planets have the same albedo, that term will cancel out when taking the ratio.

So the equilibrium temperature ratio (T1/T2) would be sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2/a1 )

Because the other terms (T_star and albedo) are same for both.

So, T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

But wait, I need to make sure that the formula is correct. Let me see: the formula for T_eq is proportional to sqrt( R_star/(a) ) * sqrt( (1 - a_alb)^(1/4) ), but since albedo is same, (1 - a) is same for both planets. So when taking the ratio T1/T2, the (1 - a) terms, which are same, cancel out.

So the ratio is sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Wait, because R_star/(2a1) in the numerator for T1, and R_star/(2a2) in the denominator for T2. So when you take (T1/T2)^2 = (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) = (a2)/(a1). Therefore, T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 )

So I need to find the ratio a2/a1, then take the square root.

But wait, how do I find a1 and a2, the orbital distances of the two planets?

The problem gives information about the RV method. The RV method measures the Doppler shift, which is related to the planet's mass and its distance from the star.

In the radial velocity method, the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_* )^(1/3) ) )

But since both planets are detected via RV, and the star's mass is much larger than the planets, M_* >> M_p, so 1 + M_p/M_* ≈ 1. So K ≈ ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3) )

But I think another approach is to relate the RV semi-amplitude to the orbital distance. The RV semi-amplitude K is related to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit.

The RV semi-amplitude K can also be approximated as:

K = (v) = ( (27π G ) / (2 c) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / (1 + M_p/M_* )^(1/3) )

But again, M_p << M_*, so this simplifies, but perhaps a better approach is to use the relation between the RV semi-amplitude and the orbital distance.

The radial velocity method gives a semi-amplitude K, which is the maximum velocity of the star towards/away from us. The formula for K is:

K = ( (G P ) / (2 pi c^3) )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( M_*^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_* )^(1/3) )

But perhaps another way is to use the formula that relates the RV semi-amplitude to the orbital period and distance.

Wait, perhaps it's more straightforward to think in terms of the Doppler shift. The problem states that the star's forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å experiences a shift of 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2.

Doppler shift (Δλ/λ) is given by:

Δλ / λ = v / c

But since the shifts are periodic, it's the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. So for each planet, the RV semi-amplitude K is equal to v = (Δλ/λ) * c.

Wait, wait. The Doppler shift formula is Δλ/λ = v/c, where v is the velocity of the star towards or away from us. So for each planet, the maximum shift is given, which corresponds to the semi-amplitude K.

So for Planet1: K1 = (Δλ1 / λ) * c = (0.03e-4) * 3e8 m/s.

Wait, Δλ is 0.03 Å, and λ is 6300 Å.

So Δλ/λ = 0.03 / 6300 = 3e-6.

So K1 = 3e-6 * c.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So K1 = 3e-6 * 3e8 = 9e2 m/s. Wait, that's 900 m/s? That seems way too high. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, 0.03 Å is 3e-8 meters, and 6300 Å is 6300e-10 meters. So λ = 6300e-10 m.

Wait, Δλ/λ = (3e-8 m) / (6300e-10 m) ) = (3e-8) / (6.3e-7) ) = (3 / 6.3 ) * 1e-1 = approx 0.476 * 0.1 = 0.0476.

So approximately 0.0476, which is 4.76e-2.

Then K1 = (Δλ/λ)*c = 0.0476 * 3e8 m/s = 1.428e7 m/s? That's 14,280 km/s. Wait, that can't be right because stars don't move that fast. So I must have messed up the units.

Wait, wait. The Doppler shift formula is often expressed as (Δλ / λ) = v/c, where v is the velocity. But the units must be consistent.

Δλ is 0.03 Å, which is 0.03e-10 meters. λ is 6300 Å, which is 6300e-10 meters.

So Δλ/λ = 0.03e-10 / 6300e-10 = 0.03 / 6300 = 3e-6.

So v = c * (Δλ/λ) = (3e8 m/s) * 3e-6 = 900 m/s.

Ah, okay, that makes sense. So K1 is 900 m/s.

Similarly for Planet2: Δλ is 0.04 Å.

Δλ/λ = 0.04 / 6300 = 4e-5 / 6300? Wait, no, 0.04 / 6300 = 4e-5 / 6.3e3 = 4/(6.3e5) ) ≈ 6.33e-6.

Wait, wait, 0.04 / 6300 = 4e-2 / 6.3e3 = (4 / 6.3) ) * 1e-5 ≈ 0.633 * 1e-5 = 6.33e-6.

So K2 = 3e8 m/s * 6.33e-6 ≈ 1.9e3 m/s, approximately 1900 m/s.

Wait, but wait, the question says that Planet1 induces a shift of up to 0.03 Å, and Planet2 induces a shift of up to 0.04 Å. So K1 is 0.03 /6300 * c, K2 is 0.04 /6300 * c.

So:

K1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c = 3e-6 c.

K2 = (0.04 / 6300) * c = (4e-6) c.

Wait, no, because 0.03 is 3e-2, 6300 is 6.3e3. So 3e-2 /6.3e3 = 3/(6.3e5) ) = approx 4.76e-6.

Wait, no. Let me recompute correctly.

For Planet1:

Δλ = 0.03 Å = 3e-8 m

λ = 6300 Å = 6300e-10 m = 6.3e-7 m.

Δλ/λ = (3e-8) / (6.3e-7) ) = (3 / 630 ) )e-1 = (0.0047619) e-1 = 4.7619e-5.

Wait, wait: 3e-8 /6.3e-7 = (3/6.3) * (1e-8 / 1e-7 ) = (0.47619) * 0.1 = 0.047619. So 4.7619e-2.

So K1 = c * Δλ/λ = 3e8 m/s * 4.7619e-2.

Which is 3e8 * 0.047619 ≈ 1.42857e7 m/s, which is 14,285.7 m/s. But that can't be right because I've heard that RV velocities for planets are usually in the 10s of m/s, not thousands. I must have messed up the exponents.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in converting angstroms to meters. Let me double-check.

1 angstrom (Å) is 1e-10 meters.

So 0.03 Å is 0.03 * 1e-10 m = 3e-12 m.

6300 Å is 6300 * 1e-10 m = 6.3e-7 m.

So Δλ/λ = (3e-12) / (6.3e-7) ) = (3 / 6.3 ) * 1e-5 ≈ 0.476 * 1e-5 = 4.76e-6.

So K1 = c * Δλ/λ = 3e8 m/s * 4.76e-6 ≈ 1.428e3 m/s, which is 1428 m/s.

Similarly, Planet2 has Δλ=0.04 Å.

Δλ = 0.04e-10 m =4e-12 m.

Δλ/λ =4e-12 /6.3e-7= (4/6.3) * 1e-5 ≈ 0.633 * 1e-5 =6.33e-6.

K2 =3e8 *6.33e-6≈1.899e3 m/s≈1899 m/s.

So K1 is about 1428 m/s, K2 is about 1900 m/s.

But I'm a bit confused because these velocities seem high, but perhaps it's correct for very massive planets or tight orbits.

Now, the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet and the distance of the planet from the star. The formula for K is:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_* + M_p )^(1/3} (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ) * ( sin i ) / ( (P/(2π))^(1/3) * (1 + M_p/M_* )^(2/3) )

Wait, perhaps a better formula is K = (v) = ( (2 pi G ) / (c P ) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i ) / ( (M_* )^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_* )^(1/3) )

Since M_* >> M_p, the (1 + M_p/M_* ) term is approximately 1.

So K ≈ ( (2 pi G ) / (c P ) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i ) / (M_*^(2/3) )

Rearranging, we can write:

K³ ≈ (2 pi G) / (c³ P) ) * ( M_p³ sin³i ) / (M_*² )

But I'm not sure if this is the way to go. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider that for a circular orbit (e=0), the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_* + M_p )^(1/3} ) ) )^(1/1) ) * ( sin i ) / ( ( (P/(2 pi)) (1 + M_p/M_* ) )^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's think about the relation between the semi-amplitude K and the orbital distance a.

The RV method gives the semi-amplitude K, which is the star's velocity. The velocity of the star is related to the planet's velocity via the mass ratio.

Since the star and planet orbit their common center of mass, the star's velocity v_* is related to the planet's velocity v_p by v_* = (M_p / M_*) v_p.

The orbital velocity of the planet is v_p = 2π a / P.

Similarly, the star's velocity is v_* = 2π a_* / P, where a_* is the star's orbit around the barycenter.

But a_* = (M_p / (M_* + M_p)) a ≈ (M_p / M_*) a, since M_* >> M_p.

So v_* = (M_p / M_*) * v_p = (M_p / M_*) (2π a / P )

But v_* is also K, the RV semi-amplitude.

So K = (2 π G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i ) / ( (M_* )^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_* )^(1/3) ) * (1/(P^(1/3)) )

But this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to use the formula that relates K to the orbital period and the planet's mass.

Alternatively, perhaps the radial velocity semi-amplitude K can be expressed as:

K = ( (27 π G ) / (2 c^3) )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_* )^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_* )^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / (1 - e²)^(1/2) )

But since e=0 (circular orbit), the denominator becomes 1.

Given that, perhaps I can express the ratio of K1 and K2 in terms of the planet masses and orbital periods. But I don't have the periods, so maybe I need another approach.

Wait, but for a circular orbit, the semi-major axis a is related to the orbital period P via Kepler's third law.

Kepler's third law is:

P² = (4 π² a³) / ( G (M_* + M_p) )

Again, since M_* >> M_p, it simplifies to P² = (4 π² a³ ) / ( G M_* )

So, a³ = G M_* P² / (4 π² )

So, a = [ (G M_* P² )/(4 π²) ]^(1/3 )

But without knowing P, this might not help directly.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find a relation between K and a.

From the expression for K, which involves a.

Wait, let's try combining K and a.

From K = (2 pi G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i ) / ( ( M_*^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_* )^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

And from Kepler's law, P² = (4 π² a³ )/( G M_* )

So, P = ( (4 π² a³ )/( G M_* ) )^(1/2 )

Substituting P into the K equation:

K = (2 pi G )^(1/3) * (M_p ) / ( M_*^(2/3) ) * (1 / [ (4 π² a³ )/( G M_* ) )^(1/2 ) ] )^(1/3 )

Wait, perhaps that's getting too messy. Let me try substituting P in terms of a.

P = ( (4 π² a³ )/( G M_* ) )^(1/2 )

So, 1/P = [ (G M_* )/(4 π² a³ ) ]^(1/2 )

Then 1/P^(1/3 ) = [ (G M_* )/(4 π² a³ ) ]^(1/6 )

Putting back into K:

K = (2 pi G )^(1/3) * ( M_p ) / ( M_*^(2/3) ) * [ (G M_* )/(4 pi² a³ ) ]^(1/6 ) / ( (1 + M_p/M_* )^(1/3) )

Simplify exponents:

= [2 pi G]^(1/3) * [G M_* ]^(1/6) / [4 pi² a³ ]^(1/6) ) * M_p / M_*^(2/3) ) / ( (1 + M_p/M_* )^(1/3) )

Let me compute each term:

[2 pi G]^(1/3) * [G M_* ]^(1/6) = (2 pi)^(1/3) * G^(1/3) * G^(1/6) * M_*^(1/6) )

= (2 pi)^(1/3) * G^(1/3 + 1/6) * M_*^(1/6)

= (2 pi)^(1/3) * G^(1/2) * M_*^(1/6)

Similarly, denominator terms:

[4 pi² a³ ]^(1/6) = (4)^(1/6) (pi^2)^(1/6) a^(0.5)

= 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3) a^(0.5)

Putting it together:

K = [ (2 pi)^(1/3) G^(1/2) M_*^(1/6) ) / ( 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3) a^(0.5) ) ) ] * ( M_p ) / ( M_*^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_* )^(1/3) )

Simplify the fractions:

2 pi in numerator and 2 in denominator:

(2 pi)^(1/3) / 2^(1/3) ) = pi^(1/3)

Similarly, G^(1/2) remains.

M_*^(1/6) / M_*^(2/3) ) = M_*^( (1/6 - 4/6) ) = M_*^(-3/6) = M_*^(-1/2)

So now:

K = [ pi^(1/3) G^(1/2) M_*^(-1/2) ) / ( pi^(1/3) a^(0.5) ) ) ] * ( M_p ) / ( (1 + M_p/M_* )^(1/3) )

Simplify pi^(1/3) cancels.

So:

K = [ G^(1/2) M_*^(-1/2) ) / a^(0.5) ] * ( M_p ) / ( (1 + M_p/M_* )^(1/3) )

Which simplifies to:

K = ( G^(1/2) M_p ) / ( M_*^(1/2) a^(0.5) (1 + M_p/M_* )^(1/3) )

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. But perhaps we can make some approximations.

Given that M_* >> M_p, 1 + M_p/M_* ≈ 1, so (1 + M_p/M_* )^(1/3) ≈ 1.

So, K ≈ ( G^(1/2) M_p ) / ( M_*^(1/2) a^(0.5) )

Rearranged, that's:

K = ( G M_p )^(1/2) / ( M_*^(1/2) a^(1/2) )

Square both sides:

K² = ( G M_p ) / ( M_* a )

Multiply both sides by a:

K² a = G M_p / M_*

So,

a = (G M_p ) / ( M_* K² )

Wait, that seems manageable.

So, a is proportional to (M_p )/( K² )

Wait, but let me check the units. G has units [m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²], M_p in kg, M_* in kg, K in m/s.

So,

a = ( G M_p ) / ( M_* K² )

Units: [m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²] * [kg] / [kg * (m²/s²) ] = [m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻² * kg ] / [ kg m²/s² ]

Wait, numerator: G M_p → m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻² * kg = m³ s⁻².

Denominator: M_* K² → kg * (m²/s²) ) → kg m²/s².

So overall: (m³ s⁻² ) / ( kg m²/s² ) ) → (m³ s⁻² * s² ) ) / ( kg m² ) → m / kg.

Hmm, that doesn't make sense. So perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra.

Wait, let me rederive a in terms of K.

We have K ≈ ( G^(1/2) M_p ) / ( ( M_* a )^(1/2) )

So, square both sides: K² = ( G M_p ) / ( M_* a )

Multiply both sides by a: K² a = ( G M_p ) / M_*

Then,

a = ( G M_p ) / ( M_* K² )

But the units here: G has [m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²], M_p [kg], M_* [kg], K [m/s].

So numerator: G M_p → m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻² * kg = m³ s⁻².

Denominator: M_* K² → kg * (m²/s²) ) = kg m²/s².

So a = (m³ s⁻² ) / ( kg m²/s² ) ) → m / kg.

Wait, that can't be right because 'a' should have units of meters. So I must have messed up the algebra.

Wait, perhaps let me re-express from K² = (G M_p )/( M_* a )

So,

a = (G M_p )/( M_* K² )

Let me check the units:

G → m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻².

M_p → kg.

M_* → kg.

K → m/s → (m/s)^2 = m²/s².

So,

G M_p → m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻² * kg = m³ s⁻².

M_* K² → kg * m²/s².

So,

a = (m³ s⁻²) / ( kg m²/s² ) ) → (m³ s⁻² * s²) ) / ( kg m² ) → m / kg.

Which is still not right. So I must have messed up the derivation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have taken the earlier expression:

K = (2 pi G )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( ( M_*^(2/3) ) (1 + M_p/M_* )^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / ( P^(1/3) ) )

And since I don't know sin i (inclination), but perhaps it's the same for both planets, so when taking the ratio, it cancels.

But let's think: since both planets are in the same system, we can assume the same inclination angle, so sin i is the same for both.

So, let's denote K1 and K2 as the semi-amplitudes for Planet1 and Planet2.

So,

K1 = (2 pi G )^(1/3) * ( M1 sin i ) / ( M_*^(2/3) (1 + M1/M_* )^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / P1^(1/3) )

Similarly,

K2 = (2 pi G )^(1/3) * ( M2 sin i ) / ( M_*^(2/3) (1 + M2/M_* )^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / P2^(1/3) )

Taking the ratio K1/K2:

K1/K2 = [ M1 / M2 ] * [ (1 + M2/M_* )^(1/3) / (1 + M1/M_* )^(1/3) ) ] * [ P2^(1/3) / P1^(1/3) ]

But since M_* >> M1 and M2, (1 + M_p/M_* ) ≈ 1. So the terms in brackets involving (1 + ...) can be approximated as 1.

So,

K1/K2 ≈ ( M1 / M2 ) * ( P2^(1/3) / P1^(1/3) )

But from Kepler's third law, since a^3 ∝ P² (because P² = (4 pi² a^3)/( G M_* ) )

So, P1/P2 = ( a1^3 / a2^3 )^(1/2 ) ) = ( a1/a2 )^(3/2 )

Wait, Wait, no. Kepler's law is P² = (4 pi² a^3 )/( G M_* )

So,

P1² / P2² = ( a1^3 ) / ( a2^3 )

Take square roots:

P1 / P2 = ( a1^3 / a2^3 )^(1/2 ) = ( a1/a2 )^(3/2 )

So,

(P2^(1/3) ) / ( P1^(1/3) ) ) = ( P2 / P1 )^(1/3 ) = [ (a2^3 / a1^3 )^(1/2) ) ]^(1/3 )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to express P1 in terms of a1 and P2 in terms of a2.

Wait, for Kepler's law:

P1² = (4 pi² a1^3 )/( G M_* )

P2² = (4 pi² a2^3 )/( G M_* )

Taking the ratio:

(P1²)/(P2²) = (a1^3)/(a2^3 )

So,

P1/P2 = (a1/a2 )^(3/2 )

So,

(P2/P1 ) = (a2/a1 )^(3/2 )

So,

(P2^(1/3) ) / ( P1^(1/3) ) ) = ( (P2 / P1 ) )^(1/3 ) = [ (a2/a1 )^(3/2) ) ]^(1/3 ) = (a2/a1 )^( 1/2 )

So, putting this back into the ratio K1/K2:

K1/K2 ≈ ( M1 / M2 ) * ( a2/a1 )^(1/2 )

But we have K1 and K2 measured, so let's plug in the numbers.

We have K1 = 1428 m/s (from Planet1's shift)

K2 = 1899 m/s (from Planet2's shift)

So,

K1/K2 = 1428 / 1899 ≈ 0.752.

Then,

0.752 ≈ ( M1 / M2 ) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

We know M1 =7 Earth masses, M2=5 Earth masses.

So,

M1/M2=7/5=1.4.

So,

0.752 ≈ 1.4 * sqrt( a2/a1 )

Divide both sides by 1.4:

0.752 /1.4 ≈ sqrt( a2/a1 )

0.752 /1.4 ≈ 0.537.

So,

sqrt( a2/a1 ) ≈ 0.537 → a2/a1 ≈ (0.537)^2 ≈ 0.288.

So,

a2 ≈ 0.288 a1.

Wait, but wait, the ratio K1/K2 is about 0.752, so K1 is smaller than K2. So, with M1 > M2, the ratio (M1/M2) is 1.4, and (a2/a1 )^0.5 is about 0.537.

So, a2 is about 0.288 times a1. So a1 is larger than a2.

Wait, but that implies that Planet1 is further away from the star than Planet2. That makes sense, because a higher mass planet would cause a larger K (if a is the same), but in this case, K2 is larger than K1. So, if M2 < M1, but K2 > K1, that suggests that a2 must be smaller than a1, because K depends on both mass and a.

Wait, but according to our ratio, a2 is about 0.288 a1. So, a1 is larger than a2. So Planet1 is further out.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me recap.

We have:

K1/K2 ≈ ( M1 / M2 ) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

We have K1=1428 m/s, K2=1900 m/s.

So K1/K2 = 1428 / 1900 ≈ 0.7516.

So,

0.7516 = (7/5) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

7/5 is 1.4.

So,

0.7516 /1.4 = sqrt( a2/a1 )

0.7516 /1.4 ≈ 0.537.

So,

sqrt( a2/a1 ) = 0.537 → a2/a1 = (0.537)^2 ≈ 0.288.

So a2 ≈ 0.288 a1.

So, the ratio a2/a1 is approximately 0.288.

Remember, earlier, the equilibrium temperature ratio is T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 )

So,

T1/T2 = sqrt( 0.288 ) ≈ 0.537.

So approximately 0.537, which is about 0.54. Looking at the options, option C is ~0.53, which is close.

Wait, but let me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Another way: the formula I derived earlier was T_eq = T_* * sqrt( R_* / (2a) ) * ( (1 - a) )^(1/4 )

So, the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( ( R_* / (2a1) ) / ( R_* / (2a2) ) ) ) * ( (1 - a1) / (1 - a2) )^(1/4 )

But since both have same albedo, (1 - a1)=(1 -a2), so that term becomes 1. So ratio is sqrt( a2/(a1) )

Which is what I used earlier.

So, yes, the ratio is sqrt( a2/a1 ) ≈ sqrt(0.288) ≈ 0.537.

So the equilibrium temperature of Planet1 is about 0.537 times that of Planet2.

So the ratio T1/T2 is ~0.537, which is approximately 0.54, so option C is ~0.53.


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we use the equilibrium temperature formula:

\[
T_{\text{eq}} = T_* \sqrt{\frac{R_*}{2a}} \left(1 - a_p\right)^{1/4}
\]

where \(T_*\) is the star's effective temperature, \(R_*\) is the star's radius, \(a\) is the planet's orbital distance, and \(a_p\) is the planet's albedo. Since both planets have the same albedo (\(a_p\)), the \((1 - a_p)^{1/4}\) term cancels out when taking the ratio. Thus, the equilibrium temperature ratio is:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

To find \(a_1\) and \(a_2\), we use the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude \(K\), which is related to the orbital distance \(a\) and the planet's mass \(M_p\). The RV semi-amplitude is given by:

\[
K = \frac{(G M_p \sin i)}{(M_*^{2/3} a^{1/2})}
\]

For circular orbits (\(e = 0\)) and assuming the same inclination (\(\sin i \approx 1\)), the ratio of the semi-amplitudes \(K_1\) and \(K_2\) is:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{M_1}{M_2} \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Rearranging for \(\sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}\):

\[
\sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \frac{K_1}{K_2} \cdot \frac{M_2}{M_1}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \(K_1\) and \(K_2\)
The Doppler shift provides the semi-amplitudes:
- For Planet1: \(\Delta \lambda / \lambda = 0.03 / 6300 = 4.76 \times 10^{-6}\), so \(K_1 = c \cdot (\Delta \lambda / \lambda) = 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 4.76 \times 10^{-6} = 1428 \, \text{m/s}\).
- For Planet2: \(\Delta \lambda / \lambda = 0.04 / 6300 = 6.33 \times 10^{-6}\), so \(K_2 = c \cdot (\Delta \lambda / \lambda) = 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 6.33 \times 10^{-6} = 1900 \, \text{m/s}\).

### Step 2: Compute the ratio \(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\)
\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{1428}{1900} \approx 0.752
\]

### Step 3: Compute \(\sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}\)
The masses of the planets are \(M_1 = 7 \, M_\oplus\) and \(M_2 = 5 \, M_\oplus\), so:

\[
\frac{M_2}{M_1} = \frac{5}{7} \approx 0.714
\]

Substitute into the formula:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \frac{K_1}{K_2} \cdot \frac{M_2}{M_1} = 0.752 \cdot 0.714 \approx 0.537
\]

### Step 4: Compute the equilibrium temperature ratio
The equilibrium temperature ratio is:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} \approx 0.537
\]

### Final Answer:
The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately \(0.53\), which corresponds to **Option C**.
