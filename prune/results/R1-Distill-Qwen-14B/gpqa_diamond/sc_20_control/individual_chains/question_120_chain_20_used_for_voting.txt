Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says to assume stars are uniformly distributed. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. The options are various inverse powers of parallax. So I need to figure out what the relationship is between the number of stars and the parallax.

Wait, parallax is related to distance. I remember that parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/distance (d), right? So distance d = 1/plx.

If the stars are uniformly distributed, their number density is constant in space. So the number of stars in a certain volume depends on the volume. But how does that translate into the number per unit parallax?

Let me think in terms of a volume element. In three dimensions, the volume of a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dd would be 4πd² dd. So number of stars in that shell would be proportional to 4πd² dd, assuming uniform density.

But we're looking at the number per unit range of parallax. Since plx (p) is 1/d, then d = 1/p. So let's substitute d in terms of p.

The volume element becomes 4π (1/p)^2 * (dd). But since p = 1/d, then dd is the change in d. Let me express dd in terms of p. Hmm, since d = 1/p, dd = - (1/p²) dp. So when p changes by dp, d changes by -1/p² dp. Wait, but when considering the shell between d and d+dd, that corresponds to a change in p. Let me see, if p = 1/d, then dp = - (1/d²) dd. So rearranging, dd = -d² dp. Substituting d=1/p, dd = -(1/p²) dp.

But when integrating, we're considering the volume element as d^2 dd, which is (1/p)^2 * dd. Substituting dd from above, that's (1/p²) * (-1/p²) dp. Wait, but the negative would just indicate the direction of change, but since we're dealing with magnitudes, we can take the absolute value.

So the volume element in terms of p would be 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p^2) dp. Because dd is (1/p^2) dp, but with a negative, which we'll ignore for the magnitude. So 4π * (1/p^2) * (1/p^2) dp. That's 4π (1/p^4) dp.

So the number of stars in a shell corresponding to a change in p (parallax) would be proportional to 1/p^4 multiplied by the thickness dp. So the number per unit range of p (like per dp) is proportional to 1/p^4. Wait, but the question asks for the number per unit range of parallax. So that would be N ∝ 1/p^4.

Wait, but the options are about how the number changes with p. So the number per unit plx (dp) is proportional to 1/p^4. So the number of stars in a given range decreases as p^4. So the number per unit plx decreases as 1/p^4.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mess up the substitution. So I have N = 4π d² dd * n, where n is the number density. Then, substituting d = 1/p, and dd = (1/p²) dp, because p = 1/d → dp = - (1/d²) dd → dd = -d² dp = - (1/p²) dp. So substituting into N:

N = 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) dp * n = 4π n (1/p^4) dp.

So N is proportional to 1/p^4. Therefore, the number of stars per unit parallax (i.e., per unit dp) decreases as 1/p^4. So the correct answer should be option A, which is ~1/plx^4.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you change variables, the exponents can be tricky. Let me think again. The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d is proportional to d². But since each shell at a certain d corresponds to a certain p, and the thickness in p is dp, we have to relate the two.

Each shell at d is a thin sphere. Its volume is 4π d² dd. Now, we want this in terms of p. So d = 1/p → dd = - (1/p²) dp. So substitute into the volume: 4π (1/p)^2 * (-1/p²) dp. The negative sign indicates that as p increases, d decreases, but we're interested in magnitude. So the volume becomes proportional to 1/p^4 dp.

So the number of stars in that volume is proportional to 1/p^4. So the number per unit p is 1/p^4. So the answer should be option A.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax \( p \) is inversely proportional to distance \( d \), i.e., \( p = 1/d \). Assuming stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( 4\pi d^2 dd \).

Expressing \( d \) in terms of \( p \), we have \( d = 1/p \), and differentiating gives \( dd = -\frac{1}{p^2} dp \). Substituting these into the volume expression for the shell, the volume becomes:

\[
4\pi d^2 dd = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{p}\right)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{p^2} dp\right) = 4\pi \frac{1}{p^4} dp.
\]

The number of stars in the shell is proportional to this volume, so the number of stars per unit range of parallax (i.e., per unit \( dp \)) is proportional to \( 1/p^4 \). Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( 1/p^4 \).

The correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
