Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. It's about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let me try to break it down.

First, the question says the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis. Oh, right, Oz is the z-axis, so the magnetic field is pointing along that. And m is small, so I guess m is the orbital magnetic quantum number. Oh wait, but m is the magnetic quantum number for the orbital angular momentum, right? Its possible values are from -l to +l in integer steps. But the problem says m is small, so maybe m is 0 or 1 or something like that.

The magnetic field B is 1 Tesla. I remember that 1 Tesla is a pretty strong magnetic field, but I'm not exactly sure how that compares to typical lab settings. Anyway, moving on.

The question is asking me to compare the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom, which has a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. Wait, 0.4861 micrometers is about 486.1 nanometers. Oh, that's the wavelength of the Balmer-alpha line, the transition from n=2 to n=1 in hydrogen. So the energy difference ΔE would be the energy of that photon.

I think I need to calculate both the paramagnetic coupling term and the transition energy ΔE and then see which is bigger.

Let me start with ΔE. The energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ. So h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light. Let me plug in the numbers.

h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. c is about 3 x 10^8 m/s. λ is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1 nanometers or 4.861e-7 meters.

So ΔE = (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) / (4.861e-7 m). Let me compute that.

Calculating numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = approx 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by denominator: 4.861e-7 m → 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 ≈ 4.088e-19 J.

Wait, that's the energy in joules. To get it in more familiar units, like electron volts, since in atomic physics, eV is common.

1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 4.088e-19 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 2.55 eV. So ΔE is around 2.55 eV.

Wait, but wait, I remember that the Balmer-alpha transition is from n=2 to n=1, which has a wavelength around 656 nm, but wait, 0.486 micrometers is about 486 nm, which is the Balmer-beta line, right? Or wait, maybe I got that wrong. Wait, Balmer series is transitions to n=2. So n=3 to n=2 is 656 nm (H-alpha), n=4 to n=2 is about 486 nm (H-beta). Oh wait, the Balmer-alpha is 656nm. So 486 nm is H-beta. So the energy here is the energy difference for that transition.

So, yes, that ΔE is about 2.55 eV. But wait, I need to confirm the exact value. Alternatively, perhaps I can use Rydberg's formula to compute the energy. But maybe it's easier to just go with the photon energy approach.

So ΔE ≈ 2.55 eV.

Now, the paramagnetic coupling term. Paramagnetism is due to the interaction between the magnetic moment of electrons and an external magnetic field. The energy shift due to this coupling is given by the Zeeman effect. The Hamiltonian for the Zeeman effect is H = -μ·B. The magnetic moment μ is given by μ = -gμ_B m_s, where g is the Landé g-factor, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m_s is the spin magnetic quantum number.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the question mentions the orbital magnetic quantum number m. Wait, I'm a bit confused. The paramagnetic coupling usually refers to the spin-orbit interaction, but perhaps in this context, it's the orbital contribution.

Wait, wait, no. The paramagnetic effect in hydrogen is primarily due to the electron's magnetic moment due to its spin and orbital motion. But for the hydrogen atom, the orbital magnetic moment is much smaller than the spin's because for the ground state, l=0, so the orbital contribution is zero, but in excited states, l>0, so m can be non-zero. But wait, the question says small m, so m could be 0 or 1, perhaps. But maybe I should think about which term is dominant.

Wait, the paramagnetic coupling term is the Zeeman term, which is the energy shift due to the magnetic field. The energy is given by ΔE_Zeeman = μ_B * B * m. Hmm, but wait, I think the orbital contribution is μ = μ_B * (L·z) / ħ, so the Zeeman term is -μ·B, which is -μ_B * m * B, where m is the magnetic quantum number for orbital angular momentum. Wait, but actually, the magnetic moment due to orbital motion is μ_L = (e/(2m_e)) * L_z. And the energy is H = -μ_L · B. So H = - (e/(2m_e)) * (ħ m) ) * B.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The orbital magnetic moment is μ_L = (eħ)/(2m_e) ) * m, where m is the orbital magnetic quantum number. So the energy is H = -μ_L · B. Since B is along z-axis, H = -μ_L * B = - (e ħ m)/(2m_e) * B.

Wait, but the Bohr magneton μ_B is defined as μ_B = (eħ)/(2m_e). So H = - μ_B * m * B.

So the energy shift is H = - μ_B * m * B. So the magnitude is |H| = μ_B * m * B.

Wait, but the problem says that m is small. So perhaps m is 1 or 0. Let's assume m=1. Then the energy shift is μ_B * B.

So what's μ_B? The Bohr magneton is approximately 9.274e-24 J/T. So with B=1 T, μ_B * B is 9.274e-24 J.

To get this in eV, since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so 9.274e-24 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = approximately 5.79e-5 eV. So about 5.8e-5 eV.

Wait, but the transition energy ΔE is about 2.55 eV, right? So the paramagnetic coupling term is 5.8e-5 eV, which is much smaller than ΔE (≈2.55 eV). So the paramagnetic term is much smaller. So the question is, what's the ratio of the paramagnetic term to ΔE.

So the paramagnetic term is H = μ_B m B. If m is small, say m=1, then H ≈ 5.8e-5 eV. ΔE is about 2.55 eV. So H / ΔE ≈ 5.8e-5 / 2.55 ≈ 2.27e-5. So H is about 2e-5 times ΔE, which is much less than one. So H << ΔE.

Wait, but wait, what if m is zero? Then H would be zero. But the question states m is small, not zero. So perhaps m=1 is the case here.

So the paramagnetic coupling is much smaller than the transition energy. Therefore, the average value of H would be much less than ΔE.

Wait, but wait—am I confusing the paramagnetic coupling term with the actual energy level splitting? Because in the presence of a magnetic field, the energy levels split, leading to Zeeman effect. So in this case, the energy shift due to the magnetic field is H = μ_B m B. So for m=1, it's about 5.8e-5 eV, while ΔE is about 2.55 eV.

So the paramagnetic term is way smaller than the transition energy. So the order of magnitude is that ⟨H⟩ is much less than ΔE.

So looking at the options, the choices are:

A) ⟨H⟩ = ΔE → no, way smaller.

B) ⟨H⟩ >> ΔE → no, much smaller.

C) ⟨H⟩ << ΔE → yes.

D) ⟨H⟩ > ΔE → no.

So the correct answer is C.

Wait, but another thought: maybe the paramagnetic coupling term refers to the spin-orbit interaction instead of the Zeeman term. Wait, spin-orbit coupling is a different thing. The spin-orbit interaction energy is proportional to (1/(n^3 l (l+1/2)) )) and so on, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the paramagnetic term is the same as the Zeeman term.

Wait, paramagnetic coupling in hydrogen is primarily due to the electron's spin in a magnetic field, right? No, wait, wait. Paramagnetism arises from the magnetic moments of electrons. The Zeeman effect is the interaction of the magnetic moment with an external field. So in that case, the paramagnetic term is the same as the Zeeman term. So my earlier calculation holds.

So the paramagnetic coupling term is about 5.8e-5 eV, and ΔE is 2.55 eV, so the former is much smaller. Hence, ⟨H⟩ is much less than ΔE.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To compare the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy \( \Delta E \) of the hydrogen atom, we analyze both quantities:

### Transition Energy \( \Delta E \)
The transition energy corresponds to the energy difference for the Balmer-beta transition in hydrogen, where \( \lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu \text{m} \). Using the photon energy formula:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]

where:
- \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) (Planck's constant),
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) (speed of light),
- \( \lambda = 4.861 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \).

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{4.861 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 4.088 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{4.088 \times 10^{-19}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV}.
\]

Thus, \( \Delta E \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV} \).

### Paramagnetic Coupling Term
The paramagnetic coupling term arises from the interaction of the electron's magnetic moment with the external magnetic field \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \). The energy shift due to this interaction is given by the Zeeman effect:

\[
\langle H \rangle = \mu_B m B,
\]

where:
- \( \mu_B = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \) (Bohr magneton),
- \( m \) is the orbital magnetic quantum number (small, assumed \( m = 1 \)),
- \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \).

Substituting the values:

\[
\langle H \rangle = (9.274 \times 10^{-24})(1)(1) = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts:

\[
\langle H \rangle \approx \frac{9.274 \times 10^{-24}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 5.79 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Thus, \( \langle H \rangle \approx 5.8 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV} \).

---

### Comparison
The transition energy \( \Delta E \) is approximately \( 2.55 \, \text{eV} \), while the paramagnetic coupling term \( \langle H \rangle \) is approximately \( 5.8 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV} \). The ratio of \( \langle H \rangle \) to \( \Delta E \) is:

\[
\frac{\langle H \rangle}{\Delta E} \approx \frac{5.8 \times 10^{-5}}{2.55} \approx 2.27 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

This shows that \( \langle H \rangle \) is much smaller than \( \Delta E \). Therefore, the correct option is:

**C) \( \langle H \rangle \ll \Delta E \).**
