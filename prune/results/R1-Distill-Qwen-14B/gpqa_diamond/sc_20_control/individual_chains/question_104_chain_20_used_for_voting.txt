Alright, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity method. Hmm, okay, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. 

The question says there are two stars with the same mass, each having a planet similar to Neptune. Both stars have solar-like masses, and the planets are in circular orbits. 

So, for planet #1, the spectral line shift is 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. Wait, but how does this relate to the orbital period of the planets?

I think the RV method measures the star's velocity towards and away from us. The formula for the semi-amplitude of the velocity (K) is given by K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P * (1 day in seconds)))^(1/3) ) 

But wait, since both planets are similar to Neptune and the stars have similar masses, M_p is much less than M_*, so I can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So the equation simplifies a bit.

Wait, but the velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3) * P^(1/3)) ) )^(1/1), or something like that. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Let me try to recall. The radial velocity semi-amplitude is given by K = [ (G * P) / (2π c) ) ]^(1/3) * [ (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2)) ) ].

But since the eccentricity e is zero for circular orbits, and assuming sin i is the same (i.e., both planets have the same inclination, like edge-on for maximum effect), then K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3) * P^(1/3)) )^(1/ something? Or wait, no. Let me get this right.

Wait, the formula I think is:

K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (4 * c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) P^(1/3) ) )

But again, since M_p << M_*, (M_* + M_p) ≈ M_*, so this becomes K ≈ (constant) * (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). 

Given that, if K1 is 5 milliangstroms and K2 is 7 milliangstroms, then K1/K2 = 5/7.

But since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) * (M_*2 / M_*1)^ (2/3) )

Wait, but the stars have the same mass, so M_*1 = M_*2. So that term is 1. So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

So (5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Wait, but wait, K is inversely proportional. So if K1 < K2, then P2 > P1? Because K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3). So if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 must be smaller than P1. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)). So higher K means shorter P. Because if P increases, K decreases.

So K1 is 5, K2 is 7. So K2 is bigger than K1. So P2 must be smaller than P1.

Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 compared to planet #1. So P2 / P1.

Wait, from the equation:

K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) → because K ∝ 1/P^(1/3). So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(-1/3) → because K2 = K1 * (P1/P2)^(1/3). Hmm, maybe I should approach it with the ratio.

Let me set up the ratio:

K1/K2 = ( (M_p1 sin i1) / (M_*^(2/3) P1^(1/3)) ) ) / ( (M_p2 sin i2) / (M_*^(2/3) P2^(1/3)) ) )

Assuming sin i1 = sin i2 (same inclination), and M_p1 ≈ M_p2 (both similar to Neptune), so M_p terms cancel out. So:

K1/K2 = (1) / ( (P1^(1/3) ) / (P2^(1/3) ) ) ) → K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

So rearranged, (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So, (5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3) → (5/7)^3 = P2/P1 → P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1. That would make the period of planet #2 about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1? So P2/P1 is 0.364. So P2 is 0.36 times P1. So P2 is shorter than P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is 0.36 times that of planet #1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So if P2 is 0.36 times P1, then P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1. So the ratio P2/P1 is 0.36.

So the options are:

A) ~0.36 → this would be the correct answer.

Wait, but wait the options say: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1? So if P2 is 0.36 times P1, then P2 is shorter, so it's 0.36 times as long. So the answer should be ~0.36, which is option A.

So the correct answer is A.

The radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines caused by the gravitational pull of the orbiting planet. The semi-amplitude of the velocity shift, \( K \), is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period, \( P \), and depends on the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, and the orbital inclination. For circular orbits and similar planetary masses, the relationship simplifies to:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

Given that the spectral line shifts for planet #1 and planet #2 are 5 milliangstroms and 7 milliangstroms, respectively, the ratio of their semi-amplitudes is:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7}
\]

Using the proportionality \( K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}} \), we can relate the orbital periods as:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Rearranging, we find:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Substituting \( \frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7} \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, the answer is approximately 0.36.
