Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about a quasar observed in the near infrared and optical spectrum. The peak is at about 790 nm, and the flux drops at shorter wavelengths. Hmm, I remember that in quasars, emission lines can be broad and sometimes show redshift.

Redshift... right! When objects are moving away from us, their light is redshifted. So if the peak is at 790 nm, which is in the near infrared, that's longer than the optical wavelengths. Wait, the usual peak for certain emission lines like Lyman alpha is in the UV, but when redshifted, it could shift into optical or even infrared.

The question is about comoving distance. Comoving distance is a way to measure distance in an expanding universe, right? The Lambda-CDM model is the standard model, so the parameters given are current Hubble constant H0 =70 km/s/Mpc, matter density Ω_m=0.3, dark energy Ω_λ=0.7, and flat universe.

I think comoving distance depends on the redshift of the object. So first, I need to find the redshift of the quasar. How? The observed wavelength λ_obs is related to the rest wavelength λ_rest by (1 + z) = λ_obs / λ_rest.

Wait, what's the rest wavelength here? The peak is at 790 nm. If the peak is from a specific emission line, like maybe the Lyman alpha line which is at about 121 nm in the rest frame. So if in the rest frame it's 121 nm, and observed at 790 nm, then 790 / 121 is approximately 6.528. So (1+z) is about 6.528, so z ≈5.528.

Wait, but sometimes the peak might not be from Lyman alpha. Other possible lines: for example, the Balmer series in optical. Like H-alpha is about 656 nm rest. If someone observes it at 790, then 790/656 ≈ 1.204, so z≈0.204. So that would be a nearby object. But that seems unlikely because the flux drops below 790 nm, which would be into the optical. Wait, but in that case, if the rest is optical, the observed would be near infrared. Hmm, but I'm not sure which emission line we're looking at.

Wait, the question mentions that shorter wavelengths than 790 nm have lower flux. So the peak is at 790, and below that, flux drops. So if it's a redshifted line, perhaps the line is moving into longer wavelengths. So if the rest frame line is in the optical, then when it's redshifted, it would move into near IR.

But wait, if the rest wavelength is in the optical, like 500 nm, then 790/500 = 1.58, so z=0.58. But then what would be the comoving distance for z=0.58 in the given cosmology?

Alternatively, if the rest wavelength is in the UV, say 121 nm (Lyman alpha), then z= 790/121 -1 ≈ 6.528. That's a high redshift.

Wait, but if the peak is at 790 nm, and the flux drops at shorter wavelengths, that suggests that the peak is the far end of the emission line. So the line must be redshifted so that the peak is at 790. So if the rest wavelength is in the UV, the redshift is high.

So which scenario is more plausible? Well, quasars are often very redshifted because they're very distant.

Assuming the peak is from a Lyman-alpha emission, which is a prominent line in quasars. So z ≈ 5.5.

Now, I need to compute the comoving distance for this redshift. The comoving distance D_C is given by the integral from 0 to z of c/(H0 * E(z')) dz', where E(z) = sqrt(Ω_r (1+z)^4 + Ω_m (1+z)^3 + Ω_lambda (1+z)^{0}) ), but wait, the dark energy density parameter in a flat universe is Ω_λ = 0.7, and matter is 0.3. So for a flat universe, Ω_m + Ω_λ + Ω_r ≈1, but since Ω_r is negligible (like maybe 1e-5) at z=5.5, it doesn't contribute much.

So E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m (1+z)^3 + Ω_λ + (Ω_r (1+z)^4)).

But at high z, Ω_m (1+z)^3 dominates. So for z=5.5, (1+z)=6.5, (6.5)^3 is about 276.7, Ω_m is 0.3, so 0.3 * 276.7 ≈ 83. So E(z)≈sqrt(83 +0.7)≈sqrt(83.7)≈9.15.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think more carefully. The E(z) factor is:

E(z) = sqrt(Ω_r (1+z)^4 + Ω_m (1+z)^3 + Ω_λ (1+z)^0 )

Assuming that Ω_r is the radiation density, which is negligible at z=5.5. So E(z) ≈ sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3 + 0.7).

At z=5.5, (1+z)=6.5, so (6.5)^3=274.625. So 0.3 *274.625 =82.3875. So E(z)=sqrt(82.3875 +0.7)=sqrt(83.0875)=approx 9.115.

But that's only at a particular z. The integral for comoving distance is over E(z') from 0 to z. So for high z, this is a bit tricky. Maybe I should use an approximation or find a table.

Alternatively, I can use the approximation formula for comoving distance for a flat universe with matter and dark energy.

I remember that for a flat universe, the comoving distance D_C can be approximated using the formula:

D_C = (c / H0) * ∫_0^z [1 / sqrt(Ω_m (1+z')^3 + Ω_λ)} ] dz'

But integrating this exactly would require numerical methods, which I'm not going to do here. Alternatively, I can refer to known approximate values.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use an online calculator or recall that for certain redshifts, what the comoving distance is.

Wait, when z is high, the universe is matter-dominated, but at z=0.7 or so, dark energy starts to dominate.

Wait, but at z=5.5, the universe is definitely in the matter-dominated era because dark energy's effect becomes significant only at lower redshifts.

So, perhaps the integral can be approximated using the matter-dominated solution, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but let's think: the integrand for the comoving distance is 1/E(z').

In a matter-dominated universe (without dark energy, Ω_λ=0), E(z)=sqrt(Ω_m (1+z)^3 + Ω_λ (1+z)^0 ), but if Ω_λ is 0, then E(z)=sqrt(Ω_m (1+z)^3) ) = (1+z)^(3/2) * sqrt(Ω_m).

So the integral becomes ∫ [1/( (1+z')^(3/2) sqrt(Ω_m) ) ] dz' from 0 to z.

Which is (1/sqrt(Ω_m)) ∫ (1+z')^(-3/2) dz' from 0 to z.

The integral of (1+z')^(-3/2) dz' is [-2/(1+z')^0.5)] + C.

So evaluating from 0 to z: (1/sqrt(Ω_m)) [ -2/(1+z)^0.5 + 2/(1+0)^0.5 ] = (2/sqrt(Ω_m)) [ 1 - 1/sqrt(1+z) ].

Thus, the comoving distance for matter-dominated universe is D_C = (c/H0) * (2/sqrt(Ω_m)) [1 - 1/sqrt(1+z) ].

But wait, in our case, Ω_λ is 0.7, so it's a flat universe (Ω_m=0.3, Ω_λ=0.7). So the integral isn't exactly this, but maybe for high z, the dark energy contribution is negligible. So perhaps we can approximate E(z) as sqrt(Ω_m (1+z)^3) )= (1+z)^(3/2) * sqrt(Ω_m).

So let's plug in z=5.5.

sqrt(1+z)=sqrt(6.5)≈2.55.

So 1/sqrt(1+z)=0.392.

Then [1 - 0.392 ] = 0.608.

So D_C = (c/H0) * (2/sqrt(0.3)) * 0.608.

Compute each part:

c is the speed of light, about 3e5 km/s.

H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc.

So c/H0 = (3e5 km/s) / (70 km/s/Mpc) )= approx 4285.7 Mpc.

2/sqrt(0.3) ≈ 2/0.5477 ≈ 3.65.

So 4285.7 * 3.65 ≈ let's compute that.

4285.7 *3 = 12857.1, 4285.7 *0.65= approx 2785.7. So total ~15642.8 Mpc.

Multiply by 0.608: 15642.8 *0.608≈ ~9507 Mpc.

Wait, but wait—this is for a matter-only universe. But in reality, the universe has dark energy, so the expansion rate is faster, which would make the comoving distance shorter than the matter-only case. That is, in a universe with dark energy, the same redshift would correspond to a shorter comoving distance compared to a matter-only universe.

So the calculation above is an overestimate because it neglects dark energy. So the real D_C is less than 9500 Mpc, which is about 9.5 Gpc.

Looking at the options, option C is 9 Gpc, D is7 Gpc.

Hmm, so what's the real value?

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the age of the universe at high z and use the relation between comoving distance and age.

Wait, another approach: Use the lookback time and then find the comoving distance.

But perhaps a better approach is to use the fact that for a flat universe with Ω_m=0.3 and Ω_λ=0.7, the comoving distance for z=5.5 is approximately known.

Wait, from standard cosmology tables, I remember that for z=5, the comoving distance is about 11 Gpc. But wait, that was for a different H0, perhaps.

Wait, let's think of H0=70, so what's the comoving distance for z=5.5?

Hmm, perhaps I should look for a standard formula or a quick approximation.

Another approach: Use the formula for comoving distance with dark energy.

The integral for the comoving distance is:

D_C = (c / H0) * ∫_0^z [1 / sqrt(Ω_m (1+z')^3 + Ω_λ)} ] dz'

But without doing the integral numerically, it's hard. Alternatively, I can recall that for high redshifts, the dark energy term doesn't matter as much because the matter term dominates.

But wait, for z=5.5, (1+z)=6.5. So (1+z)^3=274.6, multiplied by Ω_m=0.3 gives 82.3875. Ω_λ is 0.7, so total under the sqrt is 83.0875, whose sqrt is about 9.115.

So E(z)=9.115.

Wait, but that's only at z=5.5. The integral is from 0 to z, so the integrand is 1/9.115 at z=5.5, but it's lower for lower z.

Wait, perhaps I can approximate the integral by taking average values. But I'm not sure.

Another idea: Use the approximation formula for comoving distance in a flat universe with matter and dark energy.

An approximate formula is given by:

D_C = (c / H0) * [ (1 + (1 - q0) z ) / sqrt(Ω_m (1+z)^3 + Ω_λ) ) ]

Wait, I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe use the Taylor expansion or another method.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find an online calculator or a standard table that gives the comoving distance for given z, H0, Ω_m, Ω_λ.

Wait, I think in some textbooks or papers, they provide approximate comoving distances for certain redshifts.

For example, for H0=70, Ω_m=0.3, Ω_λ=0.7, here are some approximate D_C values:

z=0.5: ~1.5 Gpc

z=1: ~2 Gpc

z=2: ~7 Gpc

z=3: ~11 Gpc

z=5: ~15 Gpc

z=5.5: maybe around 16-18 Gpc?

But wait, I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up numbers. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I can use a cosmology calculator. Here's another approach.

The comoving distance can be expressed as:

D_C = (1 / H0) * ∫_0^z [ c / sqrt(Ω_r (1+z')^4 + Ω_m (1+z')^3 + Ω_λ (1+z')^0 ) ] dz'

Assuming Ω_r is negligible, it's:

D_C = (c / H0) * ∫_0^z [ 1 / sqrt(Ω_m (1+z')^3 + Ω_λ) ] dz'

But with H0=70, c=3e5 km/s.

So (c/H0) = 3e5 /70 ≈ 4285.7 Mpc.

So 4285.7 Mpc multiplied by the integral.

The integral from 0 to 5.5 of 1/sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 +0.7) dz'.

This integral is difficult without numerical methods. Alternatively, perhaps I can approximate it with a substitution.

Let me make substitution u = 1+z', so du=dz', and u goes from 1 to 6.5.

Integral becomes ∫_{1}^{6.5} [1 / sqrt(0.3 u^3 +0.7)] * (du).

Hmm. Breaking it down into two regions: when u is small (like u=1 to 3) and when u is large (3 to 6.5).

But without exact calculation, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation for E(z)=sqrt(Ω_m u^3 + Ω_λ).

At high z, so u=6.5:

E(z)=sqrt(0.3*(6.5)^3 +0.7) = sqrt(0.3 * 274.625 +0.7) )= sqrt(82.3875 +0.7)= sqrt(83.0875)=~9.115.

So 1/E(z)=1/9.115≈0.1097.

So the integrand at u=6.5 is ~0.1097.

But the function 1/E(z) decreases as u increases, because E(z) increases. So the integral is the area under a curve that starts at u=1:

At u=1: E= sqrt(0.3 +0.7)=1, so 1/E=1.

At u=2: 0.3*(8)=2.4, +0.7=3.1. E= sqrt(3.1)= ~1.76. 1/E≈0.568.

At u=3: 0.3 *27=8.1 +0.7=8.8. E= sqrt(8.8)= ~2.966. 1/E≈0.337.

u=4: 0.3*(64)=19.2 +0.7=19.9. E~4.46. 1/E≈0.224.

u=5: 0.3*125=37.5 +0.7=38.2. E≈6.18. 1/E≈0.161.

u=6: 0.3*216=64.8 +0.7=65.5. E≈8.09. 1/E≈0.1236.

u=6.5: as before, 1/E≈0.1097.

So the function 1/E(z) starts at 1, decreases to about 0.1097 at u=6.5.

The integral is the sum of areas under this curve from u=1 to u=6.5.

Approximating the integral by trapezoidal rule:

Divide into intervals, say, between u=1, 2,3,4,5,6,6.5.

Compute the value at each u, then approximate each segment.

Between u=1 and u=2:

At u=1: 1.

u=2: 0.568.

Average: (1 +0.568)/2= 0.784. The width is 1, so area=0.784 *1=0.784.

u=2 to u=3:

Values at 2:0.568, at3:0.337.

Average: (0.568+0.337)/2=0.4525. Width=1. Area=0.4525.

u=3 to4: 0.337 and 0.224. Average= (0.337+0.224)/2=0.2805. Width=1. Area=0.2805.

u=4 to5: 0.224 and 0.161. Average= (0.224+0.161)/2= 0.1925. Area=0.1925.

u=5 to6: 0.161 and 0.1236. Average= (0.161+0.1236)/2=0.1423. Area=0.1423.

u=6 to6.5: 0.1236 and 0.1097. Average= (0.1236+0.1097)/2=0.11665. Width=0.5. Area=0.11665 *0.5=0.0583.

Now sum all these areas:

0.784 +0.4525=1.2365

+0.2805 → 1.517

+0.1925 → 1.7095

+0.1423 →1.8518

+0.0583 →1.9101.

So approximately 1.91.

So the integral from u=1 to u=6.5 is about 1.91.

Wait, that would make D_C = (c/H0) * 1.91 ≈4285.7 Mpc *1.91 ≈8208 Mpc, or ~8.2 Gpc.

Looking at the options, option B is 8 Gpc, option D is7 Gpc.

But wait, this is a rough approximation. The actual integral would be a bit different, as I only took a few points. Maybe the real integral is closer to 2 or 2.2, which would bring D_C to around 8.5 Gpc or so.

Wait, but earlier when I considered the matter-dominated case, I got about 9.5 Gpc, but that was without considering dark energy, which would make the universe expand faster, decreasing the comoving distance. So the correct value is less than that.

Hmm. So with the approximation, I get approximately 8.2 Gpc. The options are 6,7,8,9.

So the best guess from this is option D (7 Gpc) or B (8 Gpc). But my rough calculation gives about8.2, which is close to8 Gpc.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about other factors. For instance, perhaps the peak isn't from Lyman alpha but another line. Let's reevaluate.

If the peak is at 790 nm, which is in the near infrared, and the flux drops below that, perhaps the rest wavelength is in the optical.

Suppose the emission line is H-alpha, which is at 656 nm rest. Then:

z = (790/656 ) -1 ≈ (1.204) -1 =0.204.

So that would be a much lower redshift, z=0.2.

Comoving distance for z=0.2.

In that case, the E(z) = sqrt(0.3*(1.2)^3 +0.7) = sqrt(0.3*(1.728) +0.7 ) = sqrt(0.5184 +0.7) = sqrt(1.2184)≈1.1036.

The comoving distance is (c/H0) * ∫_0^0.2 [1 / E(z')] dz'.

Approximating the integral:

At z=0.2, the integrand is 1/sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 +0.7).

At z' from 0 to 0.2:

At z'=0: E=1, so 1/E=1.

At z'=0.2: E≈1.1036, so 1/E≈0.906.

Assume the integrand decreases linearly from 1 to 0.906 over 0.2.

Average is (1 +0.906)/2=0.953. The integral is 0.2 *0.953 ≈0.1906.

So D_C= (3e5 /70) * 0.1906 ≈4285.7 *0.1906≈816 Mpc, which is about 0.8 Gpc. But that's way shorter than the options given. The options are all 6-9 Gpc.

So this suggests that the peak isn't from H-alpha, but from a higher redshift line, like Lyman alpha. So earlier scenario is more plausible.

So back to z≈5.5.

With that, the comoving distance would be around 8 Gpc (option B) or 7 Gpc (option D).

But wait, another approach: Using standard cosmology calculators.

I recall that for z=5.5, with H0=70, Ω_m=0.3, Ω_λ=0.7, the comoving distance is approximately 14.2 Gpc. Wait, that's higher than the options given. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the comoving distance with the luminosity distance.

Wait, no, the question specifically asks for comoving distance.

Hmm, but maybe I should double-check my initial assumption about the redshift.

The observed wavelength is 790 nm. If this is the Lyman alpha line, which is at 121.6 nm in rest frame, then (1+z)=790/121.6≈6.5 → z=5.5.

But the question says that the flux drops for wavelengths <790 nm. So the peak is at 790, and the flux is lower at shorter wavelengths. That suggests that the emission line is redward of 790 nm, which would imply that the rest frame is bluer than 790. So if the peak is at 790 nm, and the flux drops below that, perhaps the emission line is centered at 790 and extends to bluer wavelengths. So in the rest frame, the line is at 790/(1+z) nm.

Wait, the peak observed is 790. So if the rest wavelength is λ_rest, then λ_obs = (1+z) * λ_rest.

So if the flux drops at wavelengths shorter than 790, that suggests that the peak is the far end of the emission line. So the emission line in the rest frame must be at longer wavelengths than 790/(1+z) nm.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the observed wavelength is longer than the rest. Let me think.

Wait, when a source is moving away, wavelengths are stretched. So emission lines are observed at longer wavelengths. So for example, if the rest wavelength of the line is 500 nm, and z=1, the observed wavelength is 1000 nm (1 micron, which is infrared). But if the line is broad, the observed line would be from 1000*(1 - Δ) to 1000*(1 + Δ), where Δ is the line width.

Wait, but the question says that the flux drops significantly for wavelengths <790 nm. So the peak is at 790, and on the blue side (shorter wavelengths), flux is lower. That suggests that the line is moving redward, so the peak is at the far end. So in the rest frame, the line would be at around 790/(1+z) nm. So if the observed peak is at 790, then the rest frame peak is at 790/(1+z) nm. But if the line is symmetric, the blue side would be at 790/(1+z) * (1 - delta), and red side at 790/(1+z) * (1 + delta). So the observed peak is at 790, which is the red end; the blue end would be at shorter wavelengths.

Wait, but the flux drops below 790, so the line is present up to 790 but not beyond. That suggests that the line is centered at 790 in the observed frame, which would imply that the rest frame is at 790/(1+z). Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Another approach: The peak is at 790 nm. If in the rest frame, the peak is at λ_rest, then λ_obs = (1+z) λ_rest.

If the observed spectrum shows a peak at 790 nm, and the flux drops below that, perhaps the line is at 790 nm, which is the far end of the emission line. So the rest wavelength would be shorter, implying a higher redshift.

Wait, but without knowing the rest wavelength, it's hard to find the redshift.

Alternatively, perhaps the peak is in the near-infrared, implying that the rest wavelength is in the UV, giving a high redshift.

But without knowing the rest wavelength, perhaps we can't find the exact redshift, but the question seems to suggest that the peak is due to a specific emission line, perhaps Lyman alpha, which is known to be in the UV.

Given that, z≈5.5, and the comoving distance is about 8 Gpc.

Looking at the options, B is 8 Gpc, D is7 Gpc.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the integration; maybe the actual comoving distance is lower.

Another thought: perhaps I should consider that the integral is about 1.8 instead of 1.91, which would bring the comoving distance down to around 8 Gpc. Or perhaps the integral is higher.

Alternatively, perhaps using the approximation that for high redshifts, the comoving distance scales as (1+z) / H0 * c.

Wait, that's when the universe is matter-dominated, and dark energy is negligible. But in reality, dark energy makes the expansion faster, so the comoving distance would be larger than the matter-only case.

Wait no, in a universe with dark energy, the expansion accelerates, so for the same redshift, the comoving distance is actually smaller than in a matter-only universe.

Wait, that complicates things. Because in a matter-only universe, the comoving distance increases with z, but in a dark-energy universe, it may not increase as much.

So for z=5.5, the comoving distance in the standard Lambda-CDM model would be larger than in a matter-only model? Or smaller?

Wait, no, because dark energy accelerates expansion, which for a given z, dark energy makes the universe expand more, which leads to a lower comoving distance compared to a matter-only universe. Because the expansion is faster, so for a given z, you're looking back in time but E(z) is larger, so the integrand 1/E(z) is smaller, leading to a smaller integral, hence a smaller D_C.

Wait, that's conflicting with what I thought earlier. Let me clarify.

In a matter-dominated universe, a higher z means looking further back when the universe was smaller, so the comoving distance increases with z.

In a dark energy dominated universe, for high z (where matter still dominates), the comoving distance would be similar to the matter-only case. But for lower z where dark energy starts to dominate, the expansion accelerates, making the comoving distance larger than in matter-only.

Wait, no, dark energy causes expansion to accelerate, meaning that for a given z, the expansion at later times (lower z) is faster, which affects the comoving distance.

Wait, perhaps it's better to refer to the actual comoving distance for z=5.5 in the given cosmology.

Looking up some data, I find that for H0=70, Ω_m=0.3, Ω_λ=0.7, comoving distance at z=5 is approximately 14 Gpc. Wait, but that's higher than the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misremembering. Another source I recall says that for z=5, D_C is about 12 Gpc. Hmm, but that's still higher than the options given.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to accept that without exact integration, we can't find the precise D_C, but using the given options, the best fit is around 8 Gpc.

Alternatively, perhaps the redshift is lower than 5.5.

Wait, what if the observed peak is due to the Balmer break or another optical line?

Wait, if the rest wavelength is 400 nm (violet), then (1+z)=790/400=1.975 → z=0.975.

In that case, the comoving distance would be:

Compute E(z) for z=0.975.

E(z) = sqrt(0.3*(1.975)^3 +0.7) → (1.975)^3≈7.75.

0.3 *7.75=2.325. 2.325 +0.7=3.025. sqrt(3.025)=1.74.

So 1/E(z)=0.5747.

The integral from 0 to 0.975 of 1/E(z') dz'.

Approximating:

z=0: E=1 →1/E=1.

z=0.5: E= sqrt(0.3*(1.5)^3 +0.7) →1.5^3=3.375. 0.3*3.375=1.0125 +0.7=1.7125 → sqrt≈1.308 →1/E=0.765.

z=0.975: E≈1.74 →1/E≈0.5747.

So, using linear approximations for the integrand.

Between z=0 and 0.5: average of 1 and 0.765 is 0.8825. Interval 0.5. Area=0.8825 *0.5=0.44125.

Between z=0.5 and 0.975: average of 0.765 and 0.5747 is ~0.6699. Interval 0.475. Area=0.6699 *0.475≈0.318.

So total integral≈0.44125 +0.318≈0.759.

Thus, D_C= (3e5/70) *0.759 ≈4285.7 *0.759≈3248 Mpc → ~3.25 Gpc.

But the options are all above 6 Gpc, so this scenario (z=0.975) doesn't fit.

So, perhaps the initial assumption that the peak is from a high-z line is correct, leading to a comoving distance of about8 Gpc.

Looking at the options, the closest is option B:8 Gpc.

But earlier approximation gave around8.2 Gpc. So perhaps the correct answer is 8 Gpc.

To determine the comoving distance of the quasar from the Earth, we analyze the observed peak at 790 nm and the flux drop at shorter wavelengths. This suggests the peak corresponds to a redshifted emission line. Assuming the rest wavelength of the line is in the ultraviolet (e.g., Lyman-alpha at 121 nm), the redshift is calculated as:

\[
(1 + z) = \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}}}{\lambda_{\text{rest}}} = \frac{790}{121} \approx 6.528 \implies z \approx 5.528
\]

With this redshift, we calculate the comoving distance \(D_C\) using the cosmological parameters: \(H_0 = 70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc}\), \(\Omega_m = 0.3\), \(\Omega_\lambda = 0.7\), and a flat universe. The comoving distance is given by:

\[
D_C = \frac{c}{H_0} \int_0^z \frac{1}{\sqrt{\Omega_m (1+z')^3 + \Omega_\lambda}} \, dz'
\]

Here, \(c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s}\), and the integral accounts for the expansion history of the universe. For high redshifts (\(z \approx 5.5\)), the universe is matter-dominated, and the dark energy contribution is negligible. Approximating the integral, the comoving distance is found to be approximately **8 Gpc**.

Considering the options provided:

- **Option A (6 Gpc):** Too low for \(z \approx 5.5\).
- **Option B (8 Gpc):** Matches the approximate calculation.
- **Option C (9 Gpc):** Slightly higher than the calculated value.
- **Option D (7 Gpc):** Close but slightly lower than the calculated value.

The best match is **8 Gpc**, corresponding to Option B.
