Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again and see what it's asking. 

The question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible for this compound and it has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants, and they're looking at the target gene in these mutants. The task is to determine which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

The goal is to get rid of the compound, so I think that probably means we want the gene that produces it to be nonfunctional. So the mutations should disrupt the gene's function. That could be done by creating a premature stop codon, a frameshift, or some other change that messes up the protein structure.

Looking at the sequences provided, each mutant has a change in the first exon area. The intact gene and the mutants are given as DNA sequences. So I need to look for which mutation disrupts the reading frame or introduces a stop codon.

Let me write out the intact gene and each mutant, perhaps highlighting the differences.

Intact gene:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Change: The third codon in the gene. The original was probably TTT (Phe), then becomes TCT (Ser) in the mutant. Wait, let me see. Let's break down the sequences into codons.

Wait, the start is ATG, which is Met. Then next three nucleotides in the intact gene: TTT. So codon 1: ATG (Met), codon 2: TTT (Phe). In Mutant 1, after ATG, the next is TTCTA... Wait, maybe it's better to compare the sequences.

Wait, the intact gene's first part is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG T...TGA.

Mutant 1: ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCGC... So the second codon is TCT (Ser) instead of TTT (Phe). Then third codon: TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu). So codon 2 and 3 in mutant 1 are changed. Let me see:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT...
Mutant 1: ATG TCT TAC GCT...

So codon 2 is TCT (Ser), codon 3 is TAC (Tyr). So that's a couple of amino acid changes. But not creating a stop codon. So no frameshift, so it's a missense mutation. Probably not leading to a nonfunctional gene unless it's a critical residue. But without knowing the protein structure, it's hard to say. So this might not be the answer.

Mutant 2:
5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So the change is after ATG. Let's see: The next three nucleotides after ATG are TTT in the intact gene. In mutant 2, it's TCT (codon 2: Ser), then AAG (codon 3: Lys). So codon 2 becomes TCT (Ser), then codon 3 is AAG (Lys). That's a substitution. So again, a missense mutation. No stop codon, no frameshift. So probably not the answer unless it disrupts an important site.

Mutant 3:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Looking at the changes. The intact gene after ATG is TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT... So in mutant 3, after ATG, it's TTT, then TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu). Then GCT remains GCT, GGT remains GGT. Wait, let me look further. Oh, wait, the next part is GTG TCA in mutant 3. In the intact gene, it's GTG GAT. So the GTG remains (Val), then in mutant 3, it's TCA (Ser), whereas in the intact it's GAT (Asp). So another substitution. So codon 5 is changed from GAT (Asp) to TCA (Ser). So again, a missense. No frameshift, no stop codon.

Mutant 4:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
So looking at the sequence: The intact gene has GCT GGT ACT. In mutant 4, GCT is followed by ACT instead of GGT ACT. Wait, let's break it down.

Intact: ...GCT GGT ACT... So that's GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr).

Mutant 4: ...GCT ACT... So after GCT, it's ACT (Thr). So instead of GGT ACT, it's ACT. So that's a change in the nucleotides. So the codon right after GCT is ACT, which is Thr. But wait, in the intact gene, the next three nucleotides after GCT are GGT (GGT is Gly), and then ACT (Thr). So in mutant 4, after GCT, it's ACT (Thr), meaning that the GGT (Gly codon) has been replaced by ACT (Thr). Wait, no, perhaps it's that the GGT is lost. Let me think about the letters.

In the intact gene, the sequence is GCT GGT ACT. So in mutant 4, it's GCT ACT. So the GGT is replaced with ACT. So that would mean that the DNA sequence after GCT has changed from GGT ACT to ACT. So the sequence is now GCT followed by ACT, making the codon after GCT as ACT (Thr). But wait, how does that affect the reading frame?

Wait, let's count the nucleotides. The intact gene has, at that point, exons that are in triplets. So the GCT is one codon (Ala), then GGT (Gly), then ACT (Thr). In mutant 4, after GCT comes ACT, which is three nucleotides. Wait, so after GCT comes ACT as the next codon. So the second codon is GCT (Ala), third is ACT (Thr). Wait, but the original has GCT (Ala), then GGT (Gly), then ACT (Thr). So in the mutant, the GGT is replaced by ACT. So that's a substitution. So codon 3: instead of GGT (Gly), it's ACT (Thr). So that's another substitution. Hmm, but wait—did the mutation cause a frameshift?

Wait, perhaps I'm looking at this wrong. Let me compare the two sequences more carefully.

Intact gene: ...GCT GGT ACT... So the next codons after GCT are GGT and ACT.

Mutant 4 sequence: ...GCT ACT... So after GCT comes ACT. So that's three nucleotides: GCT (Ala), then ACT (Thr). So that's only two codons. Wait, but where is this happening? Let me look again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me try to line them up.

Intact:
...CTGCTGGTACTTCTGT...

Mutant4:
...CTGCTACTTCTGT...

So perhaps the sequence is different. Let me align the sequences:

Intact: C T G C T G G T A C T T C T G T...
Mutant4: C T G C T A C T T C T G T...

Wait, the intact is CT GCT GGT ACT TCT...
Mutant4 is CT GCT ACT TCT...

So the part after GCT in the intact is GGT ACT TCT... So GGT is Gly, ACT is Thr, TCT is Ser.

In mutant4, it's ACT TCT... So the next codon after GCT is ACT (Thr), and then TCT (Ser). So the original had GCT (Ala), then GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser). In mutant4, it's GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser). So two codons changed: Gly to Thr, and then the rest is same. So no frameshift, just a substitution at codon 3. So again, a missense.

Wait, but wait. The question is about eliminating the anti-nutritional compound. So perhaps we need a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, like a premature stop codon or a frameshift that changes the entire downstream amino acid sequence.

Looking again at the sequences, maybe I missed a stop codon.

In the intact gene, the stop codon is TGA at the end. So let me check the mutants:

Mutant 1 ends with TCGC. So the last part is TCGC, but the stop is TGA. Wait, no, the full sequences end with ...TGA-3’. So the stop codon is present in all.

Wait, looking for stop codons in the middle might be a possibility, but all the mutants have the same stop codon.

Hmm, perhaps the mutation introduces a premature stop codon.

Wait, let me see each mutant:

Mutant 1: The sequence doesn't seem to have a stop codon early. Let me check. The first exons won't necessarily have a stop codon, but perhaps the mutation introduces a stop in the coding region.

Wait, perhaps the mutations cause a frameshift, leading to a premature stop.

Wait, another approach: when a mutation changes the reading frame, it can cause a frameshift, leading to a completely different downstream amino acid sequence, which could result in a nonfunctional protein. That could eliminate the compound.

So I need to look for a mutation that causes a frameshift. How would that happen? It would require an insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides not divisible by three, because that would shift the reading frame.

Looking at the mutants:

Mutant 1: Let's see the change in the DNA. The original in that part is TTT CTC GCT, and in mutant 1, it's TCT TAC GCT. So that's a substitution, not an insertion or deletion. So no frameshift.

Mutant 2: The sequence changes from TTT CTC GCT to TCT AAG GCT. Again, substitution, not insertion or deletion. So no frameshift.

Mutant 3: Changes from TCT CTC GCT to TTT TAC GCT. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me re-express the sequences.

Wait, perhaps I should compare each mutant with the intact gene, looking for insertions or deletions.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's look for any changes in the length of the sequence. Are any of the mutant sequences longer or shorter than the intact?

The intact gene and the mutants all have the same length? Let's count the number of nucleotides.

Looking at the first part:

Intact is: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG T...TGA.

Mutant 1: ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCGC...TGA.

Wait, in the mutant 1 sequence, the end is TCGC instead of TCGT. So the last part is ...TCGT in the intact and ...TCGC in mutant 1. So no change in length, just a substitution.

Mutant 2: Ends with TCGC. So same as mutant 1. So substitution, no length change.

Mutant 3: Ends with ...TCGT, same as intact. So no length change.

Mutant4: Let me check. The sequence shows ...TGA-3’ at the end. Let me see the entire sequence of mutant4:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

The intact gene's sequence is longer. Let's see, the intact gene after ATG is TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG T…TGA.

Mutant4's sequence: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCGT…TGA.

Wait, I'm not so sure about the length. Let me count the letters after ATG in both.

Intact: The first part is ATG followed by TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG T...TGA.

So that's 3 letters each for each codon. Let's see:

After ATG, the first few codons:

1. TTT (3)
2. CTC (3)
3. GCT (3)
4. GGT (3)
5. ACT (3)
6. TCT (3)
7. GTG (3)
8. GAT (3)
9. GAA (3)
10. CAA (3)
11. TAT (3)
12. TTA (3)
13. TTG (3)
14. TCG (3)
... etc.

So each is 3 nucleotides.

Mutant4: After ATG, the sequence is TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCGT...TGA.

Wait, let me count the number of nucleotides:

ATG has 3. Then TTT (3), TAC (3), GCT (3), ACT (3), TCT (3), GTG (3), GAT (3), GAA (3), CAA (3), TAT (3), TTA (3), TTG (3), TCG (3), etc. So each codon is three nucleotides. So no insertion or deletion causing a frameshift. It's a substitution.

Wait, unless I've miscounted. Let me check the exact sequences.

Intact gene:

...GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GA...

Mutant4:

...GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GA...

So in the intact, after GCT comes GGT, then ACT. But in mutant4, after GCT comes ACT. So that's a substitution of three nucleotides. So, no insertion or deletion, just a substitution. So no frameshift.

Hmm, so all of the mutations are substitution mutations, not insertions or deletions, meaning they don't cause frameshifts. So the only way to disrupt the gene's function would be introducing a premature stop codon.

So I need to look if any of these mutations introduce a stop codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA) earlier in the sequence.

Looking at the sequences:

The original gene ends with TGA, which is the stop codon.

In the mutants, any of them introduce a stop codon before that?

Let me go through each mutant.

Mutant1:

The sequence is ...TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAACATATTTATTGTCGC...TGA.

Wait, let's look for TAA, TAG, or TGA before the end.

Looking at the first part:

ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCGC...TGA.

So, the TGA is still at the end. So no early stop.

Mutant2:

5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’.

Let me check for any TAA, TAG, or TGA in the middle.

Looking at the mutant2 sequence:

ATG TCT AAG CTT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCGC...TGA.

Wait, any stop codons? The codons are:

- ATG (Met)
- TCT (Ser)
- AAG (Lys)
- CTT (Leu)
- GGT (Gly)
- ACT (Thr)
- TCT (Ser)
- GTG (Val)
- GAT (Asp)
- GAA (Glu)
- CAA (Gln)
- TAT (Tyr)
- TTA (Leu)
- TTG (Leu)
- TCG (Ser)
- C (wait, the sequence is TCGC... so the next codon after TTG would be TCG (Ser) and then C... but perhaps that's the end. No, the stop codon is TGA at the end. So no early stop.

Mutant3:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Let me check for stops.

ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC TCA CTG TGT GGA TGA... Wait, at the end of this sequence, after some parts, there's the TGA. Let me look through the codons.

Looking at the sequence:

ATG (1)
TTT (2)
TAC (3)
GCT (4)
GGT (5)
GTC (6)
TCA (7)
CTG (8)
TGT (9)
GGA (10)
TGA (11) — Oh! Here's a TGA in codon 11. So that's a premature stop codon. So in mutant3, the 11th codon is TGA, which would terminate translation early. So the protein would be shorter, possibly nonfunctional.

Wait, but wait. How do I know that the TGA is in the middle? Let me look again.

The mutant3 sequence is:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Breaking into codons:

ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC TCA CTG TGT GGA TGA ... TGA.

Wait, wait, the sequence shows 'TGA' in the middle. So the 10th codon is GGA (Gly), then the next codon is TGA (stop). So that's a stop at codon 11. So that would cause the protein to terminate early, leading to a truncated, possibly nonfunctional protein.

So this mutation would create a premature stop codon, which would likely disrupt the gene's function. So this could be the answer.

Mutant4:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Let me check for any stop codon before the end.

Looking at the codons:

ATG (1)
TTT (2)
TAC (3)
GCT (4)
ACT (5)
TCT (6)
GTG (7)
GAT (8)
GAA (9)
CAA (10)
TAT (11)
TTA (12)
TTG (13)
TCG (14)
T... (15) etc.

Hmm, I don't see a TGA in the middle. The stop is at the end.

So the only mutant that introduces a premature stop codon is mutant3. So that's the mutation we want because it would likely disrupt the gene's function, leading to the elimination of the anti-nutritional compound.

To eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the drought-resistant barley cultivar, the goal is to disrupt the function of the gene responsible for its synthesis. This can be achieved by introducing a mutation that significantly alters the gene's coding sequence, such as a premature stop codon or a frameshift. The analysis of the provided mutants is as follows:

### Intact Gene:
The intact gene sequence is:
```
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
```
It starts with the start codon `ATG` and ends with the stop codon `TGA`.

### Mutant Analysis:
1. **Mutant 1**:
   - Sequence: `5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`
   - Changes: Substitutions in codons 2 (`TCT` instead of `TTT`) and 3 (`TAC` instead of `CTC`).
   - No frameshift or premature stop codon introduced. This is a missense mutation.

2. **Mutant 2**:
   - Sequence: `5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`
   - Changes: Substitutions in codons 2 (`TCT` instead of `TTT`) and 3 (`AAG` instead of `CTC`).
   - No frameshift or premature stop codon introduced. This is a missense mutation.

3. **Mutant 3**:
   - Sequence: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`
   - Changes: Substitution in codon 3 (`TAC` instead of `CTC`) and a premature stop codon `TGA` introduced at codon 11.
   - This mutation disrupts the reading frame and introduces a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated, nonfunctional protein.

4. **Mutant 4**:
   - Sequence: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`
   - Changes: Substitution in codon 3 (`TAC` instead of `CTC`).
   - No frameshift or premature stop codon introduced. This is a missense mutation.

### Conclusion:
Among the mutants, only **Mutant 3** introduces a premature stop codon (`TGA`), which disrupts the gene's function and likely eliminates the anti-nutritional compound. The other mutants only introduce missense mutations, which do not significantly impair the gene's function.

**Answer: B**

Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again and see what it's asking. 

The question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible for this compound and it has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants, and they're looking at the target gene in these mutants. The task is to determine which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

The goal is to get rid of the compound, so I think that probably means we want the gene that produces it to be nonfunctional. So the mutations should disrupt the gene's function. That could be done by creating a premature stop codon, a frameshift, or some other change that messes up the protein structure.

Looking at the sequences provided, each mutant has a change in the first exon area. The intact gene and the mutants are given as DNA sequences. So I need to look for which mutation disrupts the reading frame or introduces a stop codon.

Let me write out the intact gene and each mutant, perhaps highlighting the differences.

Intact gene:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Change: The third codon in the gene. The original was probably TTT (Phe), then becomes TCT (Ser) in the mutant. Wait, let me see. Let's break down the sequences into codons.

Wait, the start is ATG, which is Met. Then next three nucleotides in the intact gene: TTT. So codon 1: ATG (Met), codon 2: TTT (Phe). In Mutant 1, after ATG, the next is TTCTA... Wait, maybe it's better to compare the sequences.

Wait, the intact gene's first part is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG T...TGA.

Mutant 1: ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCGC... So the second codon is TCT (Ser) instead of TTT (Phe). Then third codon: TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu). So codon 2 and 3 in mutant 1 are changed. Let me see:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT...
Mutant 1: ATG TCT TAC GCT...

So codon 2 is TCT (Ser), codon 3 is TAC (Tyr). So that's a couple of amino acid changes. But not creating a stop codon. So no frameshift, so it's a missense mutation. Probably not leading to a nonfunctional gene unless it's a critical residue. But without knowing the protein structure, it's hard to say. So this might not be the answer.

Mutant 2:
5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So the change is after ATG. Let's see: The next three nucleotides after ATG are TTT in the intact gene. In mutant 2, it's TCT (codon 2: Ser), then AAG (codon 3: Lys). So codon 2 becomes TCT (Ser), then codon 3 is AAG (Lys). That's a substitution. So again, a missense mutation. No stop codon, no frameshift. So probably not the answer unless it disrupts an important site.

Mutant 3:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Looking at the changes. The intact gene after ATG is TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT... So in mutant 3, after ATG, it's TTT, then TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu). Then GCT remains GCT, GGT remains GGT. Wait, let me look further. Oh, wait, the next part is GTG TCA in mutant 3. In the intact gene, it's GTG GAT. So the GTG remains (Val), then in mutant 3, it's TCA (Ser), whereas in the intact it's GAT (Asp). So another substitution. So codon 5 is changed from GAT (Asp) to TCA (Ser). So again, a missense. No frameshift, no stop codon.

Mutant 4:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
So looking at the sequence: The intact gene has GCT GGT ACT. In mutant 4, GCT is followed by ACT instead of GGT ACT. Wait, let's break it down.

Intact: ...GCT GGT ACT... So that's GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr).

Mutant 4: ...GCT ACT... So after GCT, it's ACT (Thr). So instead of GGT ACT, it's ACT. So that's a change in the nucleotides. So the codon right after GCT is ACT, which is Thr. But wait, in the intact gene, the next three nucleotides after GCT are GGT (GGT is Gly), and then ACT (Thr). So in mutant 4, after GCT, it's ACT (Thr), meaning that the GGT (Gly codon) has been replaced by ACT (Thr). Wait, no, perhaps it's that the GGT is lost. Let me think about the letters.

In the intact gene, the sequence is GCT GGT ACT. So in mutant 4, it's GCT ACT. So the GGT is replaced with ACT. So that would mean that the DNA sequence after GCT has changed from GGT ACT to ACT. So the sequence is now GCT followed by ACT, making the codon after GCT as ACT (Thr). But wait, how does that affect the reading frame?

Wait, let's count the nucleotides. The intact gene has, at that point, exons that are in triplets. So the GCT is one codon (Ala), then GGT (Gly), then ACT (Thr). In mutant 4, after GCT comes ACT, which is three nucleotides. Wait, so after GCT comes ACT as the next codon. So the second codon is GCT (Ala), third is ACT (Thr). Wait, but the original has GCT (Ala), then GGT (Gly), then ACT (Thr). So in the mutant, the GGT is replaced by ACT. So that's a substitution. So codon 3: instead of GGT (Gly), it's ACT (Thr). So that's another substitution. Hmm, but wait—did the mutation cause a frameshift?

Wait, perhaps I'm looking at this wrong. Let me compare the two sequences more carefully.

Intact gene: ...GCT GGT ACT... So the next codons after GCT are GGT and ACT.

Mutant 4 sequence: ...GCT ACT... So after GCT comes ACT. So that's three nucleotides: GCT (Ala), then ACT (Thr). So that's only two codons. Wait, but where is this happening? Let me look again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me try to line them up.

Intact:
...CTGCTGGTACTTCTGT...

Mutant4:
...CTGCTACTTCTGT...

So perhaps the sequence is different. Let me align the sequences:

Intact: C T G C T G G T A C T T C T G T...
Mutant4: C T G C T A C T T C T G T...

Wait, the intact is CT GCT GGT ACT TCT...
Mutant4 is CT GCT ACT TCT...

So the part after GCT in the intact is GGT ACT TCT... So GGT is Gly, ACT is Thr, TCT is Ser.

In mutant4, it's ACT TCT... So the next codon after GCT is ACT (Thr), and then TCT (Ser). So the original had GCT (Ala), then GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser). In mutant4, it's GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser). So two codons changed: Gly to Thr, and then the rest is same. So no frameshift, just a substitution at codon 3. So again, a missense.

Wait, but wait. The question is about eliminating the anti-nutritional compound. So perhaps we need a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, like a premature stop codon or a frameshift that changes the entire downstream amino acid sequence.

Looking again at the sequences, maybe I missed a stop codon.

In the intact gene, the stop codon is TGA at the end. So let me check the mutants:

Mutant 1 ends with TCGC. So the last part is TCGC, but the stop is TGA. Wait, no, the full sequences end with ...TGA-3’. So the stop codon is present in all.

Wait, looking for stop codons in the middle might be a possibility, but all the mutants have the same stop codon.

Hmm, perhaps the mutation introduces a premature stop codon.

Wait, let me see each mutant:

Mutant 1: The sequence doesn't seem to have a stop codon early. Let me check. The first exons won't necessarily have a stop codon, but perhaps the mutation introduces a stop in the coding region.

Wait, perhaps the mutations cause a frameshift, leading to a premature stop.

Wait, another approach: when a mutation changes the reading frame, it can cause a frameshift, leading to a completely different downstream amino acid sequence, which could result in a nonfunctional protein. That could eliminate the compound.

So I need to look for a mutation that causes a frameshift. How would that happen? It would require an insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides not divisible by three, because that would shift the reading frame.

Looking at the mutants:

Mutant 1: Let's see the change in the DNA. The original in that part is TTT CTC GCT, and in mutant 1, it's TCT TAC GCT. So that's a substitution, not an insertion or deletion. So no frameshift.

Mutant 2: The sequence changes from TTT CTC GCT to TCT AAG GCT. Again, substitution, not insertion or deletion. So no frameshift.

Mutant 3: Changes from TCT CTC GCT to TTT TAC GCT. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me re-express the sequences.

Wait, perhaps I should compare each mutant with the intact gene, looking for insertions or deletions.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's look for any changes in the length of the sequence. Are any of the mutant sequences longer or shorter than the intact?

The intact gene and the mutants all have the same length? Let's count the number of nucleotides.

Looking at the first part:

Intact is: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG T...TGA.

Mutant 1: ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCGC...TGA.

Wait, in the mutant 1 sequence, the end is TCGC instead of TCGT. So the last part is ...TCGT in the intact and ...TCGC in mutant 1. So no change in length, just a substitution.

Mutant 2: Ends with TCGC. So same as mutant 1. So substitution, no length change.

Mutant 3: Ends with ...TCGT, same as intact. So no length change.

Mutant4: Let me check. The sequence shows ...TGA-3’ at the end. Let me see the entire sequence of mutant4:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

The intact gene's sequence is longer. Let's see, the intact gene after ATG is TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG T…TGA.

Mutant4's sequence: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCGT…TGA.

Wait, I'm not so sure about the length. Let me count the letters after ATG in both.

Intact: The first part is ATG followed by TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG T...TGA.

So that's 3 letters each for each codon. Let's see:

After ATG, the first few codons:

1. TTT (3)
2. CTC (3)
3. GCT (3)
4. GGT (3)
5. ACT (3)
6. TCT (3)
7. GTG (3)
8. GAT (3)
9. GAA (3)
10. CAA (3)
11. TAT (3)
12. TTA (3)
13. TTG (3)
14. TCG (3)
... etc.

So each is 3 nucleotides.

Mutant4: After ATG, the sequence is TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCGT...TGA.

Wait, let me count the number of nucleotides:

ATG has 3. Then TTT (3), TAC (3), GCT (3), ACT (3), TCT (3), GTG (3), GAT (3), GAA (3), CAA (3), TAT (3), TTA (3), TTG (3), TCG (3), etc. So each codon is three nucleotides. So no insertion or deletion causing a frameshift. It's a substitution.

Wait, unless I've miscounted. Let me check the exact sequences.

Intact gene:

...GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GA...

Mutant4:

...GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GA...

So in the intact, after GCT comes GGT, then ACT. But in mutant4, after GCT comes ACT. So that's a substitution of three nucleotides. So, no insertion or deletion, just a substitution. So no frameshift.

Hmm, so all of the mutations are substitution mutations, not insertions or deletions, meaning they don't cause frameshifts. So the only way to disrupt the gene's function would be introducing a premature stop codon.

So I need to look if any of these mutations introduce a stop codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA) earlier in the sequence.

Looking at the sequences:

The original gene ends with TGA, which is the stop codon.

In the mutants, any of them introduce a stop codon before that?

Let me go through each mutant.

Mutant1:

The sequence is ...TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAACATATTTATTGTCGC...TGA.

Wait, let's look for TAA, TAG, or TGA before the end.

Looking at the first part:

ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCGC...TGA.

So, the TGA is still at the end. So no early stop.

Mutant2:

5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’.

Let me check for any TAA, TAG, or TGA in the middle.

Looking at the mutant2 sequence:

ATG TCT AAG CTT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCGC...TGA.

Wait, any stop codons? The codons are:

- ATG (Met)
- TCT (Ser)
- AAG (Lys)
- CTT (Leu)
- GGT (Gly)
- ACT (Thr)
- TCT (Ser)
- GTG (Val)
- GAT (Asp)
- GAA (Glu)
- CAA (Gln)
- TAT (Tyr)
- TTA (Leu)
- TTG (Leu)
- TCG (Ser)
- C (wait, the sequence is TCGC... so the next codon after TTG would be TCG (Ser) and then C... but perhaps that's the end. No, the stop codon is TGA at the end. So no early stop.

Mutant3:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Let me check for stops.

ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC TCA CTG TGT GGA TGA... Wait, at the end of this sequence, after some parts, there's the TGA. Let me look through the codons.

Looking at the sequence:

ATG (1)
TTT (2)
TAC (3)
GCT (4)
GGT (5)
GTC (6)
TCA (7)
CTG (8)
TGT (9)
GGA (10)
TGA (11) — Oh! Here's a TGA in codon 11. So that's a premature stop codon. So in mutant3, the 11th codon is TGA, which would terminate translation early. So the protein would be shorter, possibly nonfunctional.

Wait, but wait. How do I know that the TGA is in the middle? Let me look again.

The mutant3 sequence is:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Breaking into codons:

ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC TCA CTG TGT GGA TGA ... TGA.

Wait, wait, the sequence shows 'TGA' in the middle. So the 10th codon is GGA (Gly), then the next codon is TGA (stop). So that's a stop at codon 11. So that would cause the protein to terminate early, leading to a truncated, possibly nonfunctional protein.

So this mutation would create a premature stop codon, which would likely disrupt the gene's function. So this could be the answer.

Mutant4:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Let me check for any stop codon before the end.

Looking at the codons:

ATG (1)
TTT (2)
TAC (3)
GCT (4)
ACT (5)
TCT (6)
GTG (7)
GAT (8)
GAA (9)
CAA (10)
TAT (11)
TTA (12)
TTG (13)
TCG (14)
T... (15) etc.

Hmm, I don't see a TGA in the middle. The stop is at the end.

So the only mutant that introduces a premature stop codon is mutant3. So that's the mutation we want because it would likely disrupt the gene's function, leading to the elimination of the anti-nutritional compound.


To eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the drought-resistant barley cultivar, the goal is to disrupt the function of the gene responsible for its synthesis. This can be achieved by introducing a mutation that significantly alters the gene's coding sequence, such as a premature stop codon or a frameshift. The analysis of the provided mutants is as follows:

### Intact Gene:
The intact gene sequence is:
```
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
```
It starts with the start codon `ATG` and ends with the stop codon `TGA`.

### Mutant Analysis:
1. **Mutant 1**:
   - Sequence: `5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`
   - Changes: Substitutions in codons 2 (`TCT` instead of `TTT`) and 3 (`TAC` instead of `CTC`).
   - No frameshift or premature stop codon introduced. This is a missense mutation.

2. **Mutant 2**:
   - Sequence: `5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`
   - Changes: Substitutions in codons 2 (`TCT` instead of `TTT`) and 3 (`AAG` instead of `CTC`).
   - No frameshift or premature stop codon introduced. This is a missense mutation.

3. **Mutant 3**:
   - Sequence: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`
   - Changes: Substitution in codon 3 (`TAC` instead of `CTC`) and a premature stop codon `TGA` introduced at codon 11.
   - This mutation disrupts the reading frame and introduces a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated, nonfunctional protein.

4. **Mutant 4**:
   - Sequence: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`
   - Changes: Substitution in codon 3 (`TAC` instead of `CTC`).
   - No frameshift or premature stop codon introduced. This is a missense mutation.

### Conclusion:
Among the mutants, only **Mutant 3** introduces a premature stop codon (`TGA`), which disrupts the gene's function and likely eliminates the anti-nutritional compound. The other mutants only introduce missense mutations, which do not significantly impair the gene's function.
