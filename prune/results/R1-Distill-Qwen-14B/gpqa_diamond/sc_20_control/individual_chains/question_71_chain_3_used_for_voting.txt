Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see. The question is about the equilibrium temperatures of exoplanets in a system using the transit timing variation method. Hmm.

So, the setup is that there are five exoplanets, Planet_1 to Planet_5, with orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. They're in orbital resonance, so their periods are related by simple ratios. All have the same albedo, which means they reflect the same amount of light. The question is asking for the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2.

Wait, equilibrium temperature... I remember that the equilibrium temperature formula for a planet is based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The formula is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - A) / (1 + e) )^(1/2), but since these planets are in circular orbits, the eccentricity e is zero. Also, since albedo A is the same for all, that term (1-A) is the same for each planet. So the main variables are the distance from the star 'a' and the star's temperature and radius.

But wait, in the formula, the equilibrium temperature depends inversely on the square root of the orbital distance. Because T_propto (L/(16πσ a² (1-A)))^1/4, but since all planets are around the same star, L and σ and other constants are the same. So T is proportional to (1/(a²))^(1/4) = 1/(a^0.5). Or wait, let me get that right.

Wait, the formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * ( R_star/(2a) )^0.5 * ( (1 - A) )^0.25. Since all planets have the same albedo, (1-A) is constant. So each planet's temperature depends on sqrt(R_star/(2a)). So T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a), since R_star and the other constants are same for each planet.

So the temperature ratio between two planets would be sqrt(a2/a1), where a2 is the semi-major axis (distance) of planet 2 and a1 that of planet 4. Wait, no, because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). So if planet 2 is farther away than planet 4, then planet 4 would be hotter than planet 2.

Wait, let me think again. The formula is T ∝ 1/sqrt(a). So if a planet is farther from the star, its equilibrium temperature is lower. So the ratio of T4 to T2 is (a2/a4)^0.5. Because T4 is proportional to 1/sqrt(a4), and T2 is proportional to 1/sqrt(a2). So T4/T2 = sqrt(a2/a4).

But I need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. So that's T4 / T2.

So to find this, I need to find the ratio of their orbital distances a4 and a2.

But the question gives the orbital periods' ratios as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So the periods are in the ratio 1, 2, 2.5, 3.5, 5 for Planets 1 to 5.

Assuming all planets are orbiting the same star, the orbital period P is related to the semi-major axis a by Kepler's third law: P² ∝ a³. More precisely, P² = (4π²/GM) a³. So for the same star, if M is the mass of the star, P² is proportional to a³.

So, the ratio of the periods squared is proportional to the ratio of a³.

Let me denote the periods as P1, P2, P3, P4, P5. Given P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.

So for Planet_2, P2 is 2. So P2 = 2 * P1.

Similarly, Planet_4's period P4 is 3.5 times P1.

We can write a2³ / a1³ = (P2² / P1²) = (4 P1²)/(P1²) )= 4? Wait, no, wait: For each planet, a_i^3 = (G M P_i^2)/(4π²), so a_i is proportional to P_i^(2/3).

So the ratio of a4 to a2 is ( P4 / P2 )^(2/3 )

Alternatively, a4 / a2 = (P4 / P2)^(2/3 )

So P4 is 3.5 and P2 is 2. So the ratio P4 / P2 = 3.5 / 2 = 1.75.

So a4/a2 = (1.75)^(2/3). Let me compute that.

Wait, 1.75 is 7/4. So (7/4)^(2/3).

Alternatively, let's compute it numerically.

First, 1.75^(1/3) is approximately cube root of 1.75. Let me think. 1.75 is between 1 and 8, so cube root of 1 is 1, cube root of 8 is 2. Cube root of 1.75 is about 1.2 (since 1.2^3 = 1.728, which is close to 1.75). So cube root of 1.75 ≈ 1.2. Then 1.2 squared is about 1.44.

So (1.75)^(2/3) ≈ 1.44.

Wait, but wait, 1.2^3 is 1.728, which is less than 1.75. So perhaps a better approximation. Let me compute 1.2^3 = 1.728. 1.205^3: Let's compute 1.205 * 1.205 = approximately 1.452. Then 1.452 * 1.205 ≈ 1.750 (close to 1.75). So cube root of 1.75 is approximately 1.205.

So (1.75)^(2/3) = ( (1.75)^(1/3) )^2 ≈ (1.205)^2 ≈ 1.452.

So a4/a2 ≈ 1.452. So the ratio of a4 to a2 is about 1.452.

But wait, the ratio a4/a2 is the same as (P4/P2)^(2/3) = (3.5/2)^(2/3) = (1.75)^(2/3).

So now, going back to the temperature ratio: T4 / T2 = sqrt( a2 / a4 ) = sqrt( 1/(1.452) ) = 1 / sqrt(1.452). Let me compute that.

sqrt(1.452) is around 1.205, since 1.205 squared is about 1.452. So 1 / 1.205 ≈ 0.829.

Wait, wait. Let me do this more accurately. Let me calculate 1.452's square root.

What's 1.2 squared? 1.44. 1.205^2= (1.2 + 0.005)^2 = 1.44 + 2*1.2*0.005 + 0.005^2 = 1.44 + 0.012 + 0.000025 = 1.452025. So yes, sqrt(1.452025) is 1.205.

So sqrt(1.452) is approximately 1.205. So 1 / 1.205 is approximately 0.829, which is about 0.83.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance (a), because T ∝ 1/sqrt(a). So T4 is proportional to 1/sqrt(a4), and T2 proportional to 1/sqrt(a2).

So T4/T2 = (1/sqrt(a4)) / (1/sqrt(a2)) ) = sqrt(a2 / a4 ) = sqrt( a2 / a4 )

Which is sqrt( (a2) / (a4) ) = sqrt( (1) / (a4/a2) )

Wait, no: a4 is (a2) * (P4/P2)^(2/3). So a4 = a2 * (3.5/2)^(2/3) = a2 * (1.75)^(2/3).

So a2/a4 = 1/(1.75)^(2/3) = (1.75)^(-2/3).

So sqrt(a2/a4) = (1.75)^(-1/3) = 1/(1.75)^(1/3).

Which is 1/(approx 1.205) ≈ 0.829.

So T4/T2 ≈ 0.829.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.83, which matches.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Alternative approach: Let's assign P1 as some value, say, P1 = 1 year. Then the periods are:

Planet_1: P1 = 1

Planet_2: P2 = 2

Planet_3: P3 = 2.5

Planet_4: P4 = 3.5

Planet_5: P5=5.

Using Kepler's law, a^3 ∝ P². So a2^3 = (P2)^2 = (2)^2 = 4.

a4^3 = (3.5)^2 = 12.25.

So a4 = (12.25)^(1/3). Let's compute 12.25^(1/3). 2^3=8, 3^3=27. So 12.25 is between 8 and 27. Let's compute 2.3^3: 2.3 *2.3=5.29, 5.29 *2.3≈12.167. Close to 12.25. So 2.3^3≈12.167. 12.25 is a bit higher. So a4≈2.3.

Similarly, a2 = (4)^(1/3) ≈ 1.5874.

So a4 is 2.3, a2 is 1.5874.

So a4/a2 = 2.3 / 1.5874 ≈ 1.45.

Then, T4/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a4 ) = sqrt(1.5874 / 2.3) = sqrt(0.69017) ≈ 0.8307.

Which is approximately 0.83.

So the ratio is approximately 0.83, which is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we use the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital distance. The equilibrium temperature \( T \) is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance \( a \), i.e., \( T \propto 1/\sqrt{a} \). Since all planets orbit the same star, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures depends only on the ratio of their orbital distances.

The orbital periods of the planets are given in the ratio \( 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 \). Using Kepler's third law, \( P^2 \propto a^3 \), the orbital distances \( a \) are proportional to \( P^{2/3} \). Thus, the ratio of the orbital distances \( a_4/a_2 \) is:

\[
\frac{a_4}{a_2} = \left(\frac{P_4}{P_2}\right)^{2/3} = \left(\frac{3.5}{2}\right)^{2/3} = (1.75)^{2/3}.
\]

Approximating \( (1.75)^{2/3} \), we find:

\[
(1.75)^{1/3} \approx 1.205 \quad \text{and} \quad (1.75)^{2/3} \approx (1.205)^2 \approx 1.452.
\]

Thus, \( a_4/a_2 \approx 1.452 \).

The equilibrium temperature ratio \( T_4/T_2 \) is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance ratio:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_4}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{1.452}} \approx \sqrt{0.690} \approx 0.83.
\]

From the options provided, the closest value is \( \sim 0.83 \).

Because T_propto (L/(16πσ a² (1-A)))^1/4, but since all planets are around the same star, L and σ and other constants are the same. So T is proportional to (1/(a²))^(1/4) = 1/(a^0.5). Or wait, let me get that right.

Wait, the formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * ( R_star/(2a) )^0.5 * ( (1 - A) )^0.25. Since all planets have the same albedo, (1-A) is constant. So each planet's temperature depends on sqrt(R_star/(2a)). So T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a), since R_star and the other constants are same for each planet.

So the temperature ratio between two planets would be sqrt(a2/a1), where a2 is the semi-major axis (distance) of planet 2 and a1 that of planet 4. Wait, no, because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). So if planet 2 is farther away than planet 4, then planet 4 would be hotter than planet 2.

Wait, let me think again. The formula is T ∝ 1/sqrt(a). So if a planet is farther from the star, its equilibrium temperature is lower. So the ratio of T4 to T2 is (a2/a4)^0.5. Because T4 is proportional to 1/sqrt(a4), and T2 is proportional to 1/sqrt(a2). So T4/T2 = sqrt(a2/a4).

But I need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. So that's T4 / T2.

So to find this, I need to find the ratio of their orbital distances a4 and a2.

But the question gives the orbital periods' ratios as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So the periods are in the ratio 1, 2, 2.5, 3.5, 5 for Planets 1 to 5.

Assuming all planets are orbiting the same star, the orbital period P is related to the semi-major axis a by Kepler's third law: P² ∝ a³. More precisely, P² = (4π²/GM) a³. So for the same star, if M is the mass of the star, P² is proportional to a³.

So, the ratio of the periods squared is proportional to the ratio of a³.

Let me denote the periods as P1, P2, P3, P4, P5. Given P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.

So for Planet_2, P2 is 2. So P2 = 2 * P1.

Similarly, Planet_4's period P4 is 3.5 times P1.

We can write a2³ / a1³ = (P2² / P1²) = (4 P1²)/(P1²) )= 4? Wait, no, wait: For each planet, a_i^3 = (G M P_i^2)/(4π²), so a_i is proportional to P_i^(2/3).

So the ratio of a4 to a2 is ( P4 / P2 )^(2/3 )

Alternatively, a4 / a2 = (P4 / P2)^(2/3 )

So P4 is 3.5 and P2 is 2. So the ratio P4 / P2 = 3.5 / 2 = 1.75.

So a4/a2 = (1.75)^(2/3). Let me compute that.

Wait, 1.75 is 7/4. So (7/4)^(2/3).

Alternatively, let's compute it numerically.

First, 1.75^(1/3) is approximately cube root of 1.75. Let me think. 1.75 is between 1 and 8, so cube root of 1 is 1, cube root of 8 is 2. Cube root of 1.75 is about 1.2 (since 1.2^3 = 1.728, which is close to 1.75). So cube root of 1.75 ≈ 1.2. Then 1.2 squared is about 1.44.

So (1.75)^(2/3) ≈ 1.44.

Wait, but wait, 1.2^3 is 1.728, which is less than 1.75. So perhaps a better approximation. Let me compute 1.2^3 = 1.728. 1.205^3: Let's compute 1.205 * 1.205 = approximately 1.452. Then 1.452 * 1.205 ≈ 1.750 (close to 1.75). So cube root of 1.75 is approximately 1.205.

So (1.75)^(2/3) = ( (1.75)^(1/3) )^2 ≈ (1.205)^2 ≈ 1.452.

So a4/a2 ≈ 1.452. So the ratio of a4 to a2 is about 1.452.

But wait, the ratio a4/a2 is the same as (P4/P2)^(2/3) = (3.5/2)^(2/3) = (1.75)^(2/3).

So now, going back to the temperature ratio: T4 / T2 = sqrt( a2 / a4 ) = sqrt( 1/(1.452) ) = 1 / sqrt(1.452). Let me compute that.

sqrt(1.452) is around 1.205, since 1.205 squared is about 1.452. So 1 / 1.205 ≈ 0.829.

Wait, wait. Let me do this more accurately. Let me calculate 1.452's square root.

What's 1.2 squared? 1.44. 1.205^2= (1.2 + 0.005)^2 = 1.44 + 2*1.2*0.005 + 0.005^2 = 1.44 + 0.012 + 0.000025 = 1.452025. So yes, sqrt(1.452025) is 1.205.

So sqrt(1.452) is approximately 1.205. So 1 / 1.205 is approximately 0.829, which is about 0.83.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance (a), because T ∝ 1/sqrt(a). So T4 is proportional to 1/sqrt(a4), and T2 proportional to 1/sqrt(a2).

So T4/T2 = (1/sqrt(a4)) / (1/sqrt(a2)) ) = sqrt(a2 / a4 ) = sqrt( a2 / a4 )

Which is sqrt( (a2) / (a4) ) = sqrt( (1) / (a4/a2) )

Wait, no: a4 is (a2) * (P4/P2)^(2/3). So a4 = a2 * (3.5/2)^(2/3) = a2 * (1.75)^(2/3).

So a2/a4 = 1/(1.75)^(2/3) = (1.75)^(-2/3).

So sqrt(a2/a4) = (1.75)^(-1/3) = 1/(1.75)^(1/3).

Which is 1/(approx 1.205) ≈ 0.829.

So T4/T2 ≈ 0.829.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.83, which matches.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Alternative approach: Let's assign P1 as some value, say, P1 = 1 year. Then the periods are:

Planet_1: P1 = 1

Planet_2: P2 = 2

Planet_3: P3 = 2.5

Planet_4: P4 = 3.5

Planet_5: P5=5.

Using Kepler's law, a^3 ∝ P². So a2^3 = (P2)^2 = (2)^2 = 4.

a4^3 = (3.5)^2 = 12.25.

So a4 = (12.25)^(1/3). Let's compute 12.25^(1/3). 2^3=8, 3^3=27. So 12.25 is between 8 and 27. Let's compute 2.3^3: 2.3 *2.3=5.29, 5.29 *2.3≈12.167. Close to 12.25. So 2.3^3≈12.167. 12.25 is a bit higher. So a4≈2.3.

Similarly, a2 = (4)^(1/3) ≈ 1.5874.

So a4 is 2.3, a2 is 1.5874.

So a4/a2 = 2.3 / 1.5874 ≈ 1.45.

Then, T4/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a4 ) = sqrt(1.5874 / 2.3) = sqrt(0.69017) ≈ 0.8307.

Which is approximately 0.83.

So the ratio is approximately 0.83, which is option C.


To determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we use the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital distance. The equilibrium temperature \( T \) is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance \( a \), i.e., \( T \propto 1/\sqrt{a} \). Since all planets orbit the same star, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures depends only on the ratio of their orbital distances.

The orbital periods of the planets are given in the ratio \( 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 \). Using Kepler's third law, \( P^2 \propto a^3 \), the orbital distances \( a \) are proportional to \( P^{2/3} \). Thus, the ratio of the orbital distances \( a_4/a_2 \) is:

\[
\frac{a_4}{a_2} = \left(\frac{P_4}{P_2}\right)^{2/3} = \left(\frac{3.5}{2}\right)^{2/3} = (1.75)^{2/3}.
\]

Approximating \( (1.75)^{2/3} \), we find:

\[
(1.75)^{1/3} \approx 1.205 \quad \text{and} \quad (1.75)^{2/3} \approx (1.205)^2 \approx 1.452.
\]

Thus, \( a_4/a_2 \approx 1.452 \).

The equilibrium temperature ratio \( T_4/T_2 \) is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance ratio:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_4}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{1.452}} \approx \sqrt{0.690} \approx 0.83.
\]

From the options provided, the closest value is \( \sim 0.83 \).
