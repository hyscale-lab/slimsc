Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work it out.

The problem says that we need to find the eigenvector of the operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. 

Wait, so P is a vector operator, right? So P is the vector made up of P_x, P_y, and P_z components. Each of these has their own matrix representations given in the problem.

Let me write down the given matrices:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So each of these is a 2x2 matrix. I remember that for spin-1/2 particles, these matrices are the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2. Pauli matrices are usually represented as σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, right?

The operator we need is P, which is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n is in the x-z plane, which means its y-component is zero. So n can be written as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ) but since it's in x-z, φ is zero or 180? Wait, no, actually, any direction in x-z would have φ = 0 or π, but maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps it's just θ measured from the z-axis, and direction in x-z implies that φ is zero. Hmm, but the problem says arbitrary direction, so perhaps the eigenvector depends on θ, the angle from the z-axis.

But wait, the eigenvector for P along n would be the spin-up state along n. The operator P is given by the dot product of vector P and n, so P = n · (P_x, P_y, P_z). So P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Since n is in x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Given that, the operator P is a 2x2 matrix. The eigenvalue is ħ/2, so we have to find the eigenvector corresponding to this eigenvalue.

Wait, but each component is scaled by ħ/2. Let me write out the general form of P.

n is a unit vector in x-z plane: n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ) because in spherical coordinates, θ is from the z-axis. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So P = sinθ * P_x + cosθ * P_z.

Substituting the matrices:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So,

P = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute the matrix inside:

sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] is [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]]
cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] is [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]]

Adding these together:

[ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

So P is (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix. So:

P = (ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

We need to find the eigenvector(s) of this matrix corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So the eigenvalue equation is:

P |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

Wait, no. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so we have:

P |v> = (+ħ/2) |v>

Wait, but P is (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix. Let's denote the matrix as M. So P = (ħ/2) M. Then the eigenvalue equation is (ħ/2) M |v> = (ħ/2) |v> → M |v> = |v> .

So the matrix M is [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]].

So the eigenvalues are solutions to det(M - λ I) = 0.

Compute the determinant:

|cosθ - λ   sinθ        |
|sinθ        -cosθ - λ |

The determinant is (cosθ - λ)(-cosθ - λ) - sinθ sinθ = 0

Expanding:

[ (-cosθ)(cosθ - λ) - λ (cosθ - λ) ] - [ sin²θ ] = 0

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute as:

(cosθ - λ)(-cosθ - λ) - (sinθ)^2 = 0

Multiply out (cosθ - λ)(-cosθ - λ):

= (-cos^2 θ - λ cosθ + λ cosθ + λ^2) → (-cos^2 θ + λ^2) 

Wait, wait, let me compute:

(cosθ - λ)(-cosθ - λ) = -cos^2 θ - λ cosθ + λ cosθ + λ^2 → which simplifies to (-cos^2 θ + λ^2)

So the determinant equation becomes:

(-cos^2 θ + λ^2) - (sin^2 θ) = 0 → (λ^2) - cos^2θ - sin^2θ = 0 → λ^2 - (cos^2θ + sin^2θ) = 0 → λ^2 -1 = 0 → λ = ±1.

So the eigenvalues are λ = 1 and λ= -1.

Wait, but our eigenvalue for P is +ħ/2. Wait, no, because P is (ħ/2) M, so the eigenvalues of P are (ħ/2) * (eigenvalues of M) → (ħ/2)(1) = ħ/2 and (ħ/2)(-1) = -ħ/2. So the eigenvalue we're looking for is the +ħ/2 case, which corresponds to λ=1 in M. So we need to find the eigenvector for M corresponding to λ=1.

So, the eigenvector equation for M is (M - I) |v> = 0.

M - I is:

[[cosθ - 1, sinθ],
 [sinθ, -cosθ - 1]]

So the matrix becomes:

Row 1: (cosθ - 1) x + sinθ y = 0
Row 2: sinθ x + (-cosθ -1) y = 0

We can set up these equations.

Taking the first equation: (cosθ - 1) x + sinθ y = 0 → (1 - cosθ) x = sinθ y → y = [ (1 - cosθ) / sinθ ] x

Hmm, (1 - cosθ)/sinθ is equal to tan(theta/2), since 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(theta/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2). So (1 - cosθ)/sinθ = [2 sin²(theta/2)] / [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] ] = tan(theta/2).

So y = tan(theta/2) x.

So the eigenvector can be written as (x, y) = x (1, tan(theta/2)).

But eigenvectors are determined up to a scalar, so we can choose x = 1, then y = tan(theta/2).

Wait, but we can write this as:

v = [1; tan(theta/2)] → but that's not normalized yet. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to write in terms of sine and cosine.

Wait, another approach: Let me parameterize the eigenvector. Let me set x = cos(theta/2), then y = sin(theta/2). Because tan(theta/2) = sin(theta/2)/cos(theta/2), so y = sin(theta/2) when x=cos(theta/2). 

Wait, that makes sense because for spin-up along z (theta=0), the eigenvector is [1; 0], which would correspond to cos(0/2) = 1, sin(0/2)=0. Similarly, for theta=pi (along negative z), the eigenvector would be [0;1], which is correct.

So the normalized eigenvector would be (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but wait, let's double-check. Let me take the matrix M and apply it to the vector (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

M = [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

M * v = [ cosθ * cos(theta/2) + sinθ * sin(theta/2), sinθ * cos(theta/2) - cosθ sin(theta/2) ]

Hmm, let's compute each component.

First component: cosθ cos(theta/2) + sinθ sin(theta/2) = cos(theta/2 - theta/2) ? Wait, wait, maybe use trigonometric identities. Let me think.

Wait, cos(theta) cos(theta/2) + sin(theta) sin(theta/2) = cos(theta - theta/2) )= cos(theta/2). Because cos(A - B) = cos A cos B + sin A sin B.

Similarly, the second component: sinθ cos(theta/2) - cosθ sin(theta/2) = sin(theta - theta/2) = sin(theta/2).

So M * v = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] which is equal to (1) * v. So yes, the vector v is indeed an eigenvector with eigenvalue 1.

But wait, when I computed M * v, I got [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)], which is exactly v. So Mv = v, which is correct because the eigenvalue is 1.

So the eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)], but we need to normalize it. Let's compute the norm. The norm squared is cos²(theta/2) + sin²(theta/2) = 1, so it's already normalized.

Wait, but wait, in some conventions, the eigenvectors might have a phase factor. For example, sometimes they include an exponential term for the phase, but in this case, since the eigenvalue is real, the eigenvector might not have an imaginary component.

Wait, no, in the problem statement, the operator P is a vector operator, and the eigenvector for spin up along n would typically have components in the computational basis (like |+x>, |+y>, |+z> states), but in this case, the direction is arbitrary in x-z, so the eigenvector depends on theta.

Now, looking at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)). But wait, the option says "elements of the normalized eigenvector". So without any hbar factors, because the eigenvectors are normalized vectors, so their elements are dimensionless.

Wait, but let me look at the options again.

Option A: (sqrt(2/3) ħ, sqrt(1/3) ħ) → these have units of ħ, which doesn’t make sense for a normalized vector, which should be unitless.

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin theta) → that's the spherical harmonics form, but for spin-1, not spin-1/2. Wait, no, because spin-1/2 states don't use those angles in the same way. Wait, actually, in the case of spin-1/2 in direction (theta, phi), the state is a superposition of |+> and |-> states. So perhaps this is not the correct form.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)) → as we derived, this is the correct form, but option C is written as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option D: (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2)) → these have factors of ħ, which is not correct for a normalized vector.

Wait, but wait, the problem says the elements of the normalized eigenvector. So the eigenvector we found is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] which is already normalized.

So which option matches that? Option C is "(\cos(\theta/2), \sin (\theta/2))"

So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistake. Let me think again.

The eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is option C.

But looking at the possible options, I see that option C is written as "(\cos(\theta/2), \sin (\theta/2))", which matches our result.

So the correct answer is option C.

To solve the problem, we need to find the normalized eigenvector of the operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is defined as $\vec{P} = \vec{n} \cdot \vec{P}$, where $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$ is a unit vector in the x-z plane. The components of $\vec{P}$ are given as:

\[
P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad
P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad
P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, the operator $\vec{P}$ simplifies to:

\[
P = \vec{n} \cdot \vec{P} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z = \sin\theta P_x + \cos\theta P_z.
\]

Substituting the matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$:

\[
P = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left[ \sin\theta \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} + \cos\theta \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \right].
\]

Simplifying:

\[
P = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is $P |v\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |v\rangle$, where the eigenvalue is $+\frac{\hbar}{2}$. This corresponds to solving:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} |v\rangle = |v\rangle.
\]

The eigenvector satisfies $(M - I)|v\rangle = 0$, where $M = \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}$. Solving the equations:

\[
(\cos\theta - 1)x + \sin\theta y = 0, \quad \sin\theta x + (-\cos\theta - 1)y = 0.
\]

From the first equation:

\[
y = \frac{1 - \cos\theta}{\sin\theta} x = \tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) x.
\]

Thus, the eigenvector can be written as:

\[
|v\rangle = x \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ \tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To normalize, we set $x = \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)$ and $y = \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)$, yielding the normalized eigenvector:

\[
|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Now, analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$ includes factors of $\hbar$, which is incorrect for a normalized eigenvector.
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$ corresponds to spherical harmonics, not spin-1/2 states.
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$ matches the derived normalized eigenvector.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$ includes incorrect factors of $\hbar$.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work it out.

The problem says that we need to find the eigenvector of the operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. 

Wait, so P is a vector operator, right? So P is the vector made up of P_x, P_y, and P_z components. Each of these has their own matrix representations given in the problem.

Let me write down the given matrices:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So each of these is a 2x2 matrix. I remember that for spin-1/2 particles, these matrices are the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2. Pauli matrices are usually represented as σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, right?

The operator we need is P, which is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n is in the x-z plane, which means its y-component is zero. So n can be written as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ) but since it's in x-z, φ is zero or 180? Wait, no, actually, any direction in x-z would have φ = 0 or π, but maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps it's just θ measured from the z-axis, and direction in x-z implies that φ is zero. Hmm, but the problem says arbitrary direction, so perhaps the eigenvector depends on θ, the angle from the z-axis.

But wait, the eigenvector for P along n would be the spin-up state along n. The operator P is given by the dot product of vector P and n, so P = n · (P_x, P_y, P_z). So P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Since n is in x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Given that, the operator P is a 2x2 matrix. The eigenvalue is ħ/2, so we have to find the eigenvector corresponding to this eigenvalue.

Wait, but each component is scaled by ħ/2. Let me write out the general form of P.

n is a unit vector in x-z plane: n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ) because in spherical coordinates, θ is from the z-axis. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So P = sinθ * P_x + cosθ * P_z.

Substituting the matrices:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So,

P = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute the matrix inside:

sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] is [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]]
cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] is [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]]

Adding these together:

[ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

So P is (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix. So:

P = (ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

We need to find the eigenvector(s) of this matrix corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So the eigenvalue equation is:

P |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

Wait, no. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so we have:

P |v> = (+ħ/2) |v>

Wait, but P is (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix. Let's denote the matrix as M. So P = (ħ/2) M. Then the eigenvalue equation is (ħ/2) M |v> = (ħ/2) |v> → M |v> = |v> .

So the matrix M is [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]].

So the eigenvalues are solutions to det(M - λ I) = 0.

Compute the determinant:

|cosθ - λ   sinθ        |
|sinθ        -cosθ - λ |

The determinant is (cosθ - λ)(-cosθ - λ) - sinθ sinθ = 0

Expanding:

[ (-cosθ)(cosθ - λ) - λ (cosθ - λ) ] - [ sin²θ ] = 0

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute as:

(cosθ - λ)(-cosθ - λ) - (sinθ)^2 = 0

Multiply out (cosθ - λ)(-cosθ - λ):

= (-cos^2 θ - λ cosθ + λ cosθ + λ^2) → (-cos^2 θ + λ^2) 

Wait, wait, let me compute:

(cosθ - λ)(-cosθ - λ) = -cos^2 θ - λ cosθ + λ cosθ + λ^2 → which simplifies to (-cos^2 θ + λ^2)

So the determinant equation becomes:

(-cos^2 θ + λ^2) - (sin^2 θ) = 0 → (λ^2) - cos^2θ - sin^2θ = 0 → λ^2 - (cos^2θ + sin^2θ) = 0 → λ^2 -1 = 0 → λ = ±1.

So the eigenvalues are λ = 1 and λ= -1.

Wait, but our eigenvalue for P is +ħ/2. Wait, no, because P is (ħ/2) M, so the eigenvalues of P are (ħ/2) * (eigenvalues of M) → (ħ/2)(1) = ħ/2 and (ħ/2)(-1) = -ħ/2. So the eigenvalue we're looking for is the +ħ/2 case, which corresponds to λ=1 in M. So we need to find the eigenvector for M corresponding to λ=1.

So, the eigenvector equation for M is (M - I) |v> = 0.

M - I is:

[[cosθ - 1, sinθ],
 [sinθ, -cosθ - 1]]

So the matrix becomes:

Row 1: (cosθ - 1) x + sinθ y = 0
Row 2: sinθ x + (-cosθ -1) y = 0

We can set up these equations.

Taking the first equation: (cosθ - 1) x + sinθ y = 0 → (1 - cosθ) x = sinθ y → y = [ (1 - cosθ) / sinθ ] x

Hmm, (1 - cosθ)/sinθ is equal to tan(theta/2), since 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(theta/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2). So (1 - cosθ)/sinθ = [2 sin²(theta/2)] / [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] ] = tan(theta/2).

So y = tan(theta/2) x.

So the eigenvector can be written as (x, y) = x (1, tan(theta/2)).

But eigenvectors are determined up to a scalar, so we can choose x = 1, then y = tan(theta/2).

Wait, but we can write this as:

v = [1; tan(theta/2)] → but that's not normalized yet. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to write in terms of sine and cosine.

Wait, another approach: Let me parameterize the eigenvector. Let me set x = cos(theta/2), then y = sin(theta/2). Because tan(theta/2) = sin(theta/2)/cos(theta/2), so y = sin(theta/2) when x=cos(theta/2). 

Wait, that makes sense because for spin-up along z (theta=0), the eigenvector is [1; 0], which would correspond to cos(0/2) = 1, sin(0/2)=0. Similarly, for theta=pi (along negative z), the eigenvector would be [0;1], which is correct.

So the normalized eigenvector would be (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but wait, let's double-check. Let me take the matrix M and apply it to the vector (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

M = [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

M * v = [ cosθ * cos(theta/2) + sinθ * sin(theta/2), sinθ * cos(theta/2) - cosθ sin(theta/2) ]

Hmm, let's compute each component.

First component: cosθ cos(theta/2) + sinθ sin(theta/2) = cos(theta/2 - theta/2) ? Wait, wait, maybe use trigonometric identities. Let me think.

Wait, cos(theta) cos(theta/2) + sin(theta) sin(theta/2) = cos(theta - theta/2) )= cos(theta/2). Because cos(A - B) = cos A cos B + sin A sin B.

Similarly, the second component: sinθ cos(theta/2) - cosθ sin(theta/2) = sin(theta - theta/2) = sin(theta/2).

So M * v = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] which is equal to (1) * v. So yes, the vector v is indeed an eigenvector with eigenvalue 1.

But wait, when I computed M * v, I got [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)], which is exactly v. So Mv = v, which is correct because the eigenvalue is 1.

So the eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)], but we need to normalize it. Let's compute the norm. The norm squared is cos²(theta/2) + sin²(theta/2) = 1, so it's already normalized.

Wait, but wait, in some conventions, the eigenvectors might have a phase factor. For example, sometimes they include an exponential term for the phase, but in this case, since the eigenvalue is real, the eigenvector might not have an imaginary component.

Wait, but let me look at the options again.

Option A: (sqrt(2/3) ħ, sqrt(1/3) ħ) → these have units of ħ, which doesn’t make sense for a normalized vector, which should be unitless.

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin theta) → that's the spherical harmonics form, but for spin-1, not spin-1/2. Wait, no, because spin-1/2 states don't use those angles in the same way. Wait, actually, in the case of spin-1/2 in direction (theta, phi), the state is a superposition of |+> and |-> states. So perhaps this is not the correct form.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)) → as we derived, this is the correct form, but option C is written as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option D: (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2)) → these have factors of ħ, which is not correct for a normalized vector.

Wait, but wait, the problem says the elements of the normalized eigenvector. So the eigenvector we found is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] which is already normalized.

So which option matches that? Option C is "(\cos(\theta/2), \sin (\theta/2))"

So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistake. Let me think again.

The eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is option C.

But looking at the possible options, I see that option C is written as "(\cos(\theta/2), \sin (\theta/2))", which matches our result.

So the correct answer is option C.


To solve the problem, we need to find the normalized eigenvector of the operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is defined as $\vec{P} = \vec{n} \cdot \vec{P}$, where $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$ is a unit vector in the x-z plane. The components of $\vec{P}$ are given as:

\[
P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad
P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad
P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, the operator $\vec{P}$ simplifies to:

\[
P = \vec{n} \cdot \vec{P} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z = \sin\theta P_x + \cos\theta P_z.
\]

Substituting the matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$:

\[
P = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left[ \sin\theta \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} + \cos\theta \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \right].
\]

Simplifying:

\[
P = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is $P |v\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |v\rangle$, where the eigenvalue is $+\frac{\hbar}{2}$. This corresponds to solving:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} |v\rangle = |v\rangle.
\]

The eigenvector satisfies $(M - I)|v\rangle = 0$, where $M = \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}$. Solving the equations:

\[
(\cos\theta - 1)x + \sin\theta y = 0, \quad \sin\theta x + (-\cos\theta - 1)y = 0.
\]

From the first equation:

\[
y = \frac{1 - \cos\theta}{\sin\theta} x = \tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) x.
\]

Thus, the eigenvector can be written as:

\[
|v\rangle = x \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ \tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To normalize, we set $x = \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)$ and $y = \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)$, yielding the normalized eigenvector:

\[
|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Now, analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$ includes factors of $\hbar$, which is incorrect for a normalized eigenvector.
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$ corresponds to spherical harmonics, not spin-1/2 states.
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$ matches the derived normalized eigenvector.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$ includes incorrect factors of $\hbar$.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
