Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the motion of its ejecta. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. 

The problem says that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are considered inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. The question is asking what distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, so we're dealing with relative motion and time differences between two frames. I remember that when you have two objects moving relative to each other, especially at high speeds, time dilation comes into play from special relativity. Oh right, because when objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, time experiences are different between frames.

But wait, in this question, the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy's center. So the galaxies are each moving relative to the other. Let me visualize this. In the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it at some speed, say v. But according to the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s. So the speed as measured in the Galaxy's frame must be the same as in the ejecta's frame, but directionally opposite. Wait, no, because one is moving towards the other. Oh, right, the relative speed is the same in either frame if we're considering the speed of approach. But I'm not sure; maybe I need to clarify that.

Wait, the problem states that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta. So the speed of the Galaxy's center relative to the ejecta is 60,000 km/s. But since the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta's speed would be the same as 60,000 km/s, right? Because in special relativity, velocities don't just add linearly because of the relativity of velocity. Wait, no, I think that's not correct. Wait, no, the velocity in each frame is the same in magnitude but opposite in direction when considering relative motion. Because if object A is moving at speed v towards object B in B's frame, then in A's frame, B is moving towards A at speed v. So yes, the magnitude is the same. So both the ejecta and the Galaxy are moving towards each other at 60,000 km/s in each other's frames? Hmm, no, wait, that can't be right because of relativity. Because according to the velocity addition formulas, velocities don't simply reverse when you switch frames. Oh wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, the problem says both are inertial frames. So each is at rest in their own frame. So in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta. Therefore, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center. Because in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards them, so yes, the speed in the Galaxy's frame is 60,000 km/s.

Wait, but that would imply that the speed is the same in both frames, but that's only possible if the relative speed is exactly the speed of light, which it's not here. Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The problem states that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving at 60,000 km/s towards them. So the relative velocity is 60,000 km/s. So the Galaxy's speed in the ejecta's frame is 60,000 km/s. But in the Galaxy's frame, what is the ejecta's speed? It's not just 60,000 km/s, because of the way velocities transform between frames in special relativity.

Wait, perhaps we can apply the velocity transformation formula. Let me recall that. The velocity u of an object in frame S (Galaxy's frame) is measured as u' in frame S' (ejecta's frame), which is moving at velocity v relative to S along the same direction.

The formula is u' = (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/c²). Wait, in this problem, let me define the frames correctly. Let's say S is the Galaxy's frame, and S' is the ejecta's frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to S. Since the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy's center, perhaps v is positive in the direction from the Galaxy to the ejecta, but I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps it's easier to think that in S (Galaxy's frame), the ejecta is moving towards S's center at speed v. So in S, u (ejecta's speed) is -v (assuming positive direction is away from the Galaxy, so the ejecta is moving towards it at v). Wait, no, perhaps in S, the ejecta is moving towards the center, so its velocity is negative, say u = -v. But in the ejecta's frame (S'), the center of the Galaxy (S) is moving towards the ejecta at 60,000 km/s, which would be the same as v' = 60,000 km/s in the direction towards the ejecta. So according to S', the Galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s.

Wait, perhaps I should apply the velocity transformation formula correctly. Let me set S as the Galaxy's frame, and S' as the ejecta's frame. The frame S' is moving at velocity V relative to S. So in S, the ejecta is at rest, but S is moving at velocity V relative to S' in the opposite direction. Wait, no, I'm getting myself confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think that S' is moving with velocity v in the direction away from S (Galaxy). Hmm.

Wait, let me approach this differently. Let me consider that the ejecta is moving at velocity v towards the center of the Galaxy in the Galaxy's frame (S). So in S, the ejecta's speed is v towards the center. Therefore, in the ejecta's frame (S'), the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at velocity v as well. But wait, that can't be correct, right? Because according to the velocity addition formula, the observed velocity in S' would be different. Wait, but the problem says that in S' (ejecta's frame), the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So v' = 60,000 km/s. So we have to find the velocity of the ejecta in S, which is v.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering relativistic effects because 60,000 km/s is 0.2c (since speed of light is about 300,000 km/s). But 0.2c is a significant fraction and relativity effects would matter. So time dilation and length contraction would apply.

The problem is asking for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So, in S' (ejecta's frame), 50 seconds elapse. We need to find how much time passes in S (Galaxy's frame) during these 50 seconds, and then use that to calculate the distance the ejecta travels in S.

Wait, no. Because from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving, so when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, the time in the Galaxy's frame might be different due to time dilation. So, the time experienced in S (Galaxy) would be longer than in S' (ejecta) because the ejecta is moving relative to the Galaxy.

Wait, no. Actually, the time experienced in a moving frame runs slower. So if 50 seconds pass in S' (the moving frame), then in S (the stationary frame), more time has passed. Because from S's perspective, S' is moving, so S' clocks run slower.

Wait, no, I'm getting this backwards. The time experienced in a frame is longer when you're in a frame where a clock is moving. So, if a clock is moving at a high speed relative to you, you would see its time as running slower. So in the Galaxy's frame (S), the ejecta's clock (S') is running slow. So if 50 seconds pass in S', then in S, more than 50 seconds have passed. So the time in S is longer. So the time in S would be t = gamma * t', where gamma is the Lorentz factor, and t' is the time in S'.

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused about which frame is which. Let me rephrase:

- S is the Galaxy frame (inertial frame).
- S' is the ejecta frame (another inertial frame, moving relative to S).

In S, the ejecta is moving towards the center at velocity v (60,000 km/s? Or is that the velocity in S')?

Wait, the problem states that in the ejecta's frame (S'), the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in S', the speed of the Galaxy (S) is 60,000 km/s. So according to S', the Galaxy is approaching at that speed.

But in S, the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy's center at speed v. Which would imply that the speed v is 60,000 km/s, but that's only if the frames are moving at that speed relative to each other, perhaps? Or not, because of the velocity addition.

Wait, perhaps I should use the velocity transformation formula. Let me try that.

The velocity transformation equation is:

u' = (u - v) / (1 - (u v) / c² )

Where u is the velocity of an object in frame S, and u' is the velocity as seen from frame S', which is moving at velocity v relative to S.

In our case, in S (Galaxy's frame), the ejecta is moving at velocity u = v_ejecta = -60,000 km/s (assuming positive is away from the Galaxy, so negative is towards it).

Wait, but wait, no. Let me set coordinate systems. Let me have the x-axis pointing from the Galaxy towards the supernova. So in the Galaxy's frame (S), the supernova's ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy, so u = -60,000 km/s.

In the ejecta's frame (S'), the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at 60,000 km/s, so the velocity of the Galaxy (S) as seen in S' is u' = +60,000 km/s.

Wait, no. Because the velocity in S' is the velocity of S relative to S'. So perhaps it's better to model S' as moving at velocity V relative to S. Let me think: if in S, the ejecta is moving at u = -v (towards the center), then in S', the velocity of the center (origin of S) is u' = +v.

Wait, maybe that's getting me tangled. Let me try to write down the variables:

In S (Galaxy frame), the ejecta is moving towards the center (negative x-direction) at speed u. So u = -v, where v is the speed (positive value).

In S' (ejecta's frame), the center of the Galaxy (origin of S) is moving towards the ejecta (which is stationary in S') at speed u' = +60,000 km/s.

So using the velocity transformation formula, u' = (u - V) / (1 - (u V)/c² ), where V is the velocity of S' relative to S. Since S' is moving at velocity V relative to S, we need to find what V is.

Wait, in S, the ejecta is moving at u = -v (say, v is 60,000 km/s? Or is that the u'?)

Wait, no. Let me clarify: The problem says that from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta. So in S' (ejecta's frame), the center of the Galaxy (S) is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So u' = +60,000 km/s.

In S, the ejecta is moving at u = -V (since V is the speed that S' is moving relative to S). Wait, no, perhaps I should think that S' is moving at velocity V relative to S. So if S' is moving towards S at V, then in S, the ejecta is moving at u = -V (assuming positive is away from S).

So, from S to S', the velocity of the center of S is u' = +60,000 km/s. Applying the velocity transformation formula:

u' = (u - V) / (1 - (u V)/c² )

Here, u is the velocity of the center of S in S. But wait, in S, the center of S is stationary, so the velocity of the center is zero. Wait, no. Wait a second, in S, the center is stationary, so the velocity of the center as observed in S is zero.

Wait, that can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in applying the velocity transformation. Let me think again. The velocity u' is the velocity of the center of the Galaxy (which is at rest in S) as observed in S'.

So in S, the center of the Galaxy is at rest, so its velocity is u = 0. So in S', the velocity of the center is u' = (0 - V) / (1 - (0 * V)/c² ) = -V / 1 = -V.

But according to the problem, in S', the center is moving towards the ejecta (which is S') at 60,000 km/s. So u' = +60,000 km/s (assuming towards the ejecta is positive in S').

So, from the formula, u' = -V. But according to the problem, u' = +60,000. So,

- V = +60,000 km/s
=> V = -60,000 km/s.

This means that the frame S' is moving at velocity V = -60,000 km/s relative to S. So, from S's perspective, S' (ejecta) is moving at V = -60,000 km/s, meaning towards the center of the Galaxy (as expected).

But wait, if the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy at 60,000 km/s, then in S, the velocity of the ejecta is u = -60,000 km/s. But according to the velocity transformation, when you're in S' (the ejecta's frame), the velocity of S (Galaxy) is u' = (0 - (-60,000)) / (1 - (0*(-60,000))/c²) ) = 60,000 km/s. Which matches the problem statement. So that's correct.

So, now we have V = -60,000 km/s. So the ejecta is moving at u = -60,000 km/s in S. So in S, the ejecta's speed is 60,000 km/s towards the center.

Now, the problem states that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame (S'). We need to find how far the ejecta travels in S's frame during that time.

But wait, in S, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s. If we knew the time in S, we could compute the distance as v * t. But the time elapsed is given in S' (50 seconds). So we need to find the corresponding time in S, then multiply by the velocity in S to find the distance.

But because of time dilation, the time in S will be longer than 50 seconds. Time dilation occurs because the two frames are moving relative to each other.

The time dilation factor is gamma, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2 / c^2)).

Here, v is the relative speed between the frames, which is 60,000 km/s. Let me compute v in terms of c. The speed of light c is approximately 300,000 km/s. So v = 60,000 km/s = 0.2 c.

So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2 ) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206.

So for each second that passes in S' (ejecta's frame), approximately 1.0206 seconds pass in S (Galaxy's frame).

But wait, the time in S is longer than in S' because S' is moving relative to S. So if 50 seconds pass in S', the time in S would be t = gamma * t'.

So t = 1.0206 * 50 ≈ 51.03 seconds.

Then, the distance the ejecta travels in S is speed * time. The speed in S is 60,000 km/s. So distance = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 60,000 * 51.03 = 3,061,800 km.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options exactly. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in which frame's time is longer. Let me think: if you're in a frame where another frame is moving, then that other frame's clocks run slower. So in S, S' is moving at 60,000 km/s, so the time in S' (t') is shorter than time in S (t). So t = gamma * t'.

Wait, that's correct, so t = gamma * t' ≈ 1.0206 * 50 ≈ 51.03 s.

So distance in S is u * t = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s = 60,000 * 51.03 = 3,061,800 km.

Looking at the options:

A) 2,940,000 km.

B) 3,000,000 km.

C) 2,880,000 km.

D) 3,060,000 km.

Hmm, 3,061,800 is closest to option D, which is 3,060,000 km. But perhaps I made an approximation error in gamma.

Let me compute gamma more accurately. Let me compute sqrt(0.96):

0.96 = 96/100 = 24/25. sqrt(24/25) = sqrt(24)/5.

sqrt(24) is approximately 4.89898, so 4.89898/5 ≈ 0.9798.

So gamma = 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.020655.

So t = 50 * 1.020655 ≈ 51.03275 s.

Then, distance = 60,000 * 51.03275 = let's compute that.

60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000.

60,000 * 1.03275 = 60,000 *1 =60,000; 60,000 *0.03275=1,965.

So total is 3,000,000 + 60,000 + 1,965 = 3,061,965 km.

Which is approximately 3,062,000 km. But option D is 3,060,000 km. So perhaps the exact calculation would give a value that rounds to this.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.

Let me compute (1 - (v²/c²)).

v = 60,000 km/s.

v² = (6e4)^2 = 3.6e9 (km²/s²).

c² = (3e5)^2 = 9e10 (km²/s²).

v²/c² = 3.6e9 / 9e10 = 0.04.

So 1 - v²/c² = 0.96.

sqrt(0.96) = approximately 0.9798.

gamma = 1 / 0.9798 = approximately 1.020655.

So t = 50 * 1.020655 = 51.03275 seconds.

distance = 60,000 km/s * 51.03275 s = 60,000 * 51.03275 = ?

60,000 * 50 = 3e6 km.

60,000 * 1.03275 = 60,000 * 1 =60,000; 60,000 * 0.03275= 1,965.

So 60,000 + 1,965 = 61,965 km.

Total distance: 3e6 + 61,965= 3,061,965 km.

Which is approximately 3,062,000 km. But the option D is 3,060,000 km. So perhaps the exact calculation gives 3,060,000 km.

Wait, perhaps in the problem, they are considering non-relativistic speeds, and using a simple time dilation factor. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem doesn't require considering relativistic effects because 60,000 km/s is not a significant fraction of c. Let me check: 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2, which is 20% of the speed of light, which is relativistic, so we can't ignore it.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach the problem differently, assuming Newtonian mechanics, but that would give a different answer.

Wait, if we ignore relativity, then the distance traveled in S would be speed * time. But the time is given in S', which is moving. So without considering relativity, the time in S would be longer, but the exact calculation would be different.

But the problem statement says to ignore gravity, rotation, and revolution, but it doesn't say to ignore relativity. So the correct approach is to include relativistic effects.

But wait, perhaps I've confused which frame's time is which. Let's think again: the time given is in S' (ejecta's frame). So the time in S (Galaxy's frame) is longer because the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s relative to S. So, using the time dilation formula, t = gamma * t'.

So, with t' =50, t= gamma *50.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2 ) ≈ 1.0206.

t ≈51.03 s.

So the distance in S is u * t =60,000 km/s *51.03 s ≈3,061,800 km.

But the options don't have this. The closest option is D) 3,060,000 km.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the classical Doppler effect and not the relativistic effects, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the velocity. Let me double-check the velocity in S.

Wait, according to the velocity transformation, when in S' the Galaxy's center is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta, the ejecta's speed in S is 60,000 km/s towards the center.

So perhaps the speed u is 60,000 km/s.

Then, the time in S is t = gamma * t' = (1/sqrt(1 - 0.04)) *50 ≈1.0206 *50=51.03 s.

Then, distance in S is u * t =60,000 *51.03=3,061,800 km.

But none of the options match exactly. The closest is D) 3,060,000 km.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute gamma with more precise numbers.

Let me calculate gamma using more decimals.

v =60,000 km/s = 0.2c.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2 ) = 1 / sqrt(0.96).

Compute sqrt(0.96):

Let me compute it more accurately.

sqrt(0.96) = approximately 0.979795897.

So gamma = 1 / 0.979795897 ≈ 1.02062.

So t = 50 * 1.02062 ≈51.031 s.

Distance =60,000 *51.031 =60,000 *50 =3,000,000; 60,000 *1.031=61,860.

Total:3,061,860 km.

Hmm, that's 3,061,860 km, which is about 3,061,860 km. But the option D is 3,060,000 km. So perhaps the problem expects us to approximate gamma as 1.02, leading to 50 *1.02=51 s, and 60,000 *51=3,060,000 km.

So the answer would be D) 3,060,000 km.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta relative to the Galaxy, considering relativistic effects due to the high speed of 60,000 km/s (0.2c). The problem involves time dilation and the relationship between distances in two inertial frames of reference.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Relative Motion and Time Dilation**:  
   - In the ejecta's frame (S'), the Galaxy's center is moving towards the ejecta at 60,000 km/s.  
   - In the Galaxy's frame (S), the ejecta is moving towards the center at the same speed, 60,000 km/s.  
   - Due to time dilation, the time experienced in the moving frame (S') is shorter than the time in the stationary frame (S). The time dilation factor is given by:  
     \[
     \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
     \]  
     where \(v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} = 0.2c\). Substituting \(v^2/c^2 = 0.04\), we find:  
     \[
     \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.04}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.0206
     \]

2. **Time in the Galaxy's Frame**:  
   - The problem states that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame (S'). Using time dilation, the time in the Galaxy's frame (S) is:  
     \[
     t = \gamma \cdot t' = 1.0206 \cdot 50 \approx 51.03 \, \text{seconds}
     \]

3. **Distance Traveled in the Galaxy's Frame**:  
   - In the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta moves at a constant speed of \(v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s}\). The distance traveled is:  
     \[
     \text{Distance} = v \cdot t = 60,000 \cdot 51.03 \approx 3,061,800 \, \text{km}
     \]

4. **Matching the Options**:  
   - The calculated distance (\(3,061,800 \, \text{km}\)) is closest to option D (\(3,060,000 \, \text{km}\)). Minor discrepancies may arise due to rounding or approximations in the problem setup.

### Conclusion:
The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame is approximately **3,060,000 km**. 

Answer: D
