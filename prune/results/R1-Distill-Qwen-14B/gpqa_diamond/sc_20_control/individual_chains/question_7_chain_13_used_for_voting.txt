Okay, so I have this physics problem about high-energy gamma-rays annihilating with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. Hmm, I remember that cosmic processes often involve interactions with the CMB because it's everywhere. The question is about figuring out the energy at which the lifetime of these gamma-rays is limited by this annihilation process. 

First, the reaction is gamma + gamma → e+ + e-. So, we're looking at photon-photon interactions. The average energy of CMB photons is given as 10^-3 eV. I think the key here is to find the gamma-ray energy where the probability of this interaction becomes so high that the gamma can't travel far without annihilating, thus limiting its lifetime.

I remember that the cross-section for photon-photon interactions increases as the center-of-mass energy increases. The threshold energy for producing electron-positron pairs is when the combined energy of the two photons is at least twice the rest mass energy of the electron. The electron mass is about 0.511 MeV, so 2 times that is 1.022 MeV. But wait, in this case, one of the photons is a high-energy gamma, and the other is a low-energy CMB photon. 

So the center-of-mass energy (sqrt(s)) should be at least 2m_e c². So sqrt(s) = 2 * 0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV. But wait, the photons are of different energies. One is high-energy gamma (E_gamma) and the other is low-energy (E_cmb = 1e-3 eV).

The total energy in the center-of-mass frame is related to the energies of the two photons. The formula for the threshold energy is when the sum of their energies in the center-of-mass frame is at least 2m_e c². Alternatively, I think the condition for the reaction to happen is that the product of their energies (E_gamma * E_cmb) should be on the order of (m_e c²)^2, because that's the condition for pair production: E1 * E2 ≈ (m_e c²)^2.

Wait, that might not be exactly right. Let me think again. The reaction gamma + photon → e+ e- can only happen if the combined energy in the center-of-mass frame is at least 2m_e c². But since the gamma is much more energetic than the CMB photon, maybe we can approximate. 

The relation between the energies. Let me denote E1 as the gamma-ray energy and E2 as the CMB photon energy (1e-3 eV). The condition for the threshold is that the sum of their energies in the center-of-mass frame is 2m_e c². Alternatively, the invariant s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2 = (sum E)^2 - (sum momentum c)^2. Since the photons are moving in opposite directions (assuming a head-on collision, which is the most probable), their momenta are opposite. So s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c - p2 c)^2.

But photons have E = pc, so p = E/(c). So, s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1/(c) c - (-E2/(c) c)) )^2. Wait, no. Wait, the momenta are in opposite directions, so p1 and p2 are in opposite directions. So, the momentum vector sum is p1 - p2 if they are moving towards each other. So, the square would be (p1 - p2)^2 c².

So s = (E1 + E2)^2 - ( (p1 c) - (p2 c) )^2.

But p1 = E1/(c) and p2 = E2/(c). So, substituting:

s = (E1 + E2)^2 - [ (E1 - E2) ]^2.

Expanding that, (E1+E2)^2 = E1² + 2 E1 E2 + E2², and (E1-E2)^2 = E1² - 2 E1 E2 + E2². Subtracting, s = [E1² + 2 E1 E2 + E2²] - [E1² - 2 E1 E2 + E2²] = 4 E1 E2.

So, s = 4 E1 E2. For the reaction to happen, s must be at least (2 m_e c²)^2. So:

4 E1 E2 ≥ (2 m_e c²)^2 → E1 E2 ≥ (m_e c²)^2.

So the condition is E1 * E2 ≥ (m_e c²)^2.

But in this case, E1 is the gamma-ray energy, E2 is the CMB photon energy (1e-3 eV). So, solving for E1:

E1 ≥ (m_e c²)^2 / E2.

m_e c² is about 0.511 MeV, which is 0.511e6 eV. So, (0.511e6 eV)^2 = (0.511)^2 * 1e12 (eV)^2.

E2 is 1e-3 eV.

So E1 ≥ (0.511^2 * 1e12) / 1e-3 → (0.261) * 1e15 eV.

Wait, let me compute that. 0.511 squared is approximately 0.261. So 0.261e12 eV² divided by 1e-3 eV is 0.261e15 eV.

0.261e15 eV = 2.61e14 eV. But wait, 1 GeV is 1e9 eV. So 2.61e14 eV is 2.61e5 GeV. So E1 is about 2.61e5 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.6e5 GeV. So that must be the answer.

Wait, let me double-check. I have E1 * E2 ≥ (m_e c²)^2 → E1 ≥ (0.511 MeV)^2 / (1e-3 eV). Wait, but (0.511 MeV) is 0.511e6 eV, so (0.511e6 eV)^2 is (0.511)^2*(1e12) (eV)^2. Divided by 1e-3 eV gives 0.261e15 eV. Which is 2.61e14 eV, which is 2.61e5 GeV. So yes, option C.

To determine the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetimes in the universe are limited by the annihilation process $\gamma\gamma\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$, we analyze the interaction between high-energy gamma-rays ($\gamma$) and low-energy CMB photons. The reaction requires the combined energy of the two photons in the center-of-mass (CM) frame to be at least twice the rest energy of the electron, i.e., $2m_e c^2 = 1.022 \, \text{MeV}$.

The invariant quantity $s$ in this process is given by:

\[
s = (E_1 + E_2)^2 - (p_1 c - p_2 c)^2,
\]

where $E_1$ and $E_2$ are the energies of the gamma-ray and CMB photon, respectively, and $p_1$ and $p_2$ are their momenta. For photons, $E = pc$, so $s$ simplifies to:

\[
s = 4E_1E_2.
\]

At the threshold for pair production, $s \geq (2m_e c^2)^2$. Substituting, we find:

\[
4E_1E_2 \geq (2m_e c^2)^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad E_1E_2 \geq (m_e c^2)^2.
\]

Given $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 0.511 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV}$ and $E_2 = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$ (the average energy of CMB photons), we solve for $E_1$:

\[
E_1 \geq \frac{(0.511 \times 10^6)^2}{10^{-3}} = \frac{0.261 \times 10^{12}}{10^{-3}} = 0.261 \times 10^{15} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Converting to GeV ($1 \, \text{GeV} = 10^9 \, \text{eV}$):

\[
E_1 \geq 0.261 \times 10^6 \, \text{GeV} = 2.61 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

This corresponds to approximately $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$. Among the options provided, the closest match is:

**C) $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$**.

Okay, so I have this physics problem about high-energy gamma-rays annihilating with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs.

The electron mass is about 0.511 MeV, so 2 times that is 1.022 MeV. But wait, in this case, one of the photons is a high-energy gamma, and the other is a low-energy CMB photon. 

So the center-of-mass energy (sqrt(s)) should be at least 2m_e c². So sqrt(s) = 2 * 0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV. But wait, the photons are of different energies. One is high-energy gamma (E_gamma) and the other is low-energy (E_cmb = 1e-3 eV).

The total energy in the center-of-mass frame is related to the energies of the two photons.

Alternatively, I think the condition for the reaction to happen is that the product of their energies (E_gamma * E_cmb) should be on the order of (m_e c²)^2, because that's the condition for pair production: E1 * E2 ≈ (m_e c²)^2.

Wait, that might not be exactly right. Let me think again. The reaction gamma + photon → e+ e- can only happen if the combined energy in the center-of-mass frame is at least 2m_e c². But since the gamma is much more energetic than the CMB photon, maybe we can approximate. 

The relation between the energies. Let me denote E1 as the gamma-ray energy and E2 as the CMB photon energy (1e-3 eV). The condition for the threshold is that the sum of their energies in the center-of-mass frame is 2m_e c². Alternatively, the invariant s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2 = (sum E)^2 - (sum momentum c)^2. Since the photons are moving in opposite directions (assuming a head-on collision, which is the most probable), their momenta are opposite. So s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c - p2 c)^2.

But photons have E = pc, so p = E/(c). So, s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1/(c) c - (-E2/(c) c)) )^2. Wait, no. Wait, the momenta are in opposite directions, so p1 and p2 are in opposite directions. So, the momentum vector sum is p1 - p2 if they are moving towards each other. So, the square would be (p1 - p2)^2 c².

So s = (E1 + E2)^2 - ( (p1 c) - (p2 c) )^2.

But p1 = E1/(c) and p2 = E2/(c). So, substituting:

s = (E1 + E2)^2 - [ (E1 - E2) ]^2.

Expanding that, (E1+E2)^2 = E1² + 2 E1 E2 + E2², and (E1-E2)^2 = E1² - 2 E1 E2 + E2². Subtracting, s = [E1² + 2 E1 E2 + E2²] - [E1² - 2 E1 E2 + E2²] = 4 E1 E2.

So, s = 4 E1 E2. For the reaction to happen, s must be at least (2 m_e c²)^2. So:

4 E1 E2 ≥ (2 m_e c²)^2 → E1 E2 ≥ (m_e c²)^2.

So the condition is E1 * E2 ≥ (m_e c²)^2.

But in this case, E1 is the gamma-ray energy, E2 is the CMB photon energy (1e-3 eV). So, solving for E1:

E1 ≥ (m_e c²)^2 / E2.

m_e c² is about 0.511 MeV, which is 0.511e6 eV. So, (0.511e6 eV)^2 = (0.511)^2 * 1e12 (eV)^2.

E2 is 1e-3 eV.

So E1 ≥ (0.511^2 * 1e12) / 1e-3 → (0.261) * 1e15 eV.

Wait, let me compute that. 0.511 squared is approximately 0.261. So 0.261e12 eV² divided by 1e-3 eV is 0.261e15 eV.

0.261e15 eV = 2.61e14 eV. But wait, 1 GeV is 1e9 eV. So 2.61e14 eV is 2.61e5 GeV. So E1 is about 2.61e5 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.6e5 GeV. So that must be the answer.

Wait, let me double-check. I have E1 * E2 ≥ (m_e c²)^2 → E1 ≥ (0.511 MeV)^2 / (1e-3 eV). Wait, but (0.511 MeV) is 0.511e6 eV, so (0.511e6 eV)^2 is (0.511)^2*(1e12) (eV)^2. Divided by 1e-3 eV gives 0.261e15 eV. Which is 2.61e14 eV, which is 2.61e5 GeV. So yes, option C.
