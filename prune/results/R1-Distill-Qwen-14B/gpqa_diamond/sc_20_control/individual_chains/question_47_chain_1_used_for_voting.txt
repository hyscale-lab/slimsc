Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is to identify a compound based on its IR and 1H NMR data. The molecular formula given is C9H11NO2. Let's see what the options are and how the spectral data can help narrow it down.

First, I'll look at the molecular formula: C9H11NO2. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. The formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=9, H=11, N=1, O=2 (but O doesn't count here). So it's (2*9 + 2 -11 +1)/2 = (20-11+1)/2 = (10)/2 = 5. So five degrees: possibly a benzene ring (3 double bonds or 3 rings, but benzene is a ring with three double bonds, which counts as 4 degrees—wait, no, benzene is a six-membered ring with three double bonds. Wait, a benzene ring has three double bonds, which is three degrees. Hmm, wait, no, each ring or double bond is one degree. So benzene would have three double bonds, contributing three degrees. Then, each ring also counts as one degree. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think again.

Wait, degree of unsaturation for benzene. Benzene has six carbons in a ring, with three double bonds. Each double bond is one degree, each ring is another. No, wait, no, each ring or each pi bond is one degree. So a benzene ring has three double bonds and one ring, but that's not right. Wait, no. Wait a benzene ring is a single ring with three double bonds. Each ring is one degree, each pi bond is another. So benzene has one ring and three pi bonds, but wait, that would be four degrees. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the formula for degree of unsaturation (DoU) is each double bond (including rings) is one DoU. So a benzene ring is a six-membered ring with three double bonds. Each double bond (or ring) counts as one. So benzene has three double bonds and one ring? No, a benzene ring is a single ring with three double bonds, so that's 4 DoU? Wait I think I'm mixing things up. Wait another approach: Each ring contributes one DoU, each pi bond (like in alkenes, alkynes, aromatic rings) contributes one. So a benzene ring has three pi bonds (from the double bonds) and one ring, totaling four DoU. But our molecule has a DoU of 5. So the rest is one more DoU, which could be an amide group (which has a double bond) or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzene ring is present, contributing four DoU, and then another double bond elsewhere, making total five. So perhaps an amide group, which is a carbonyl (another double bond), but that would make it five DoU. Or maybe an ester group.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzamide is a benzene ring with an amide group. So benzamide would have the benzene ring (4 DoU) and the amide (another double bond, so 5 DoU). The ethoxy might contribute an oxygen but doesn't add to DoU. So that fits: 5 DoU.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide has a formyl group (CHO) attached as an amide. So again, benzene (4) plus amide (1) gives 5. So fits.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate is a carboxylic acid ester (like -OAc or similar). Wait, the structure would be benzene with an amino group and a propionoate (COO-) group. So benzene (4), the amino group doesn't add, but the ester or carboxylic acid group would have a carbonyl, adding another DoU. So 5 DoU as well.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Benzoate is a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid ester group. So benzene (4) plus ester (which has a carbonyl, another DoU), making total 5. So all options fit the DoU.

Now looking at the IR data. The IR shows strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. These are likely N-H stretches. Amide N-H's are usually broad and around 3300-3500. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, such as an amide or ester. Amide carbonyls are typically around 1650-1700, while esters are higher, around 1720-1750. So the 1720 peak could indicate an ester or possibly an amide.

Wait, but amide carbonyls are usually lower. Let me think. In amides, the carbonyl is usually around 1640-1680 cm-1 because of resonance with the N-H. Ester carbonyls are higher, 1720-1750. So a peak at 1720 is more indicative of an ester or possibly a ketone. So which options have esters or amides?

Option A: Benzamide. The amide would have a carbonyl around 1650. But the IR here is 1720. Hmm, that's higher, which would suggest an ester, not an amide. So maybe A is not correct.

Option B: Formamide. Formamides have a carbonyl around 1680-1700. So 1720 is a bit high, but maybe it's a substituted formamide. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester.

Option C: Propionate ester. So the carbonyl would be around 1720, which matches the IR. So C's ester carbonyl would fit.

Option D: Benzoate ester. The carbonyl from the ester would be around 1720, so that's a fit.

So the IR suggests either a formamide (but not matching 1720) or an ester. Maybe the 1720 is more indicative of an ester.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H): likely a methyl group attached to an oxygen, like an ethyl group's CH2CH3. The triplet suggests coupling with two protons, so probably a CH2CH3 group, ethyl.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): broad singlet, 2H. Maybe an OCH2 group, or maybe adjacent to an oxygen. Alternatively, could be NH2 protons, but they're usually broad and around 1-5 ppm. But the integration is 2H, so maybe CH2 connected to something else, like an oxygen.

Wait, but the IR has strong N-H bands, so perhaps those are from an amide or amine. The NMR shows 4.0 ppm as a broad singlet, 2H. Maybe it's an NH2 group, but the integration is 2H, which would suggest two protons. Alternatively, maybe it's an OCH2 group. But the shift is around 4.0, which is typical for OCH2.

But let's think. The 4.0 ppm peak is a broad singlet. The 'bs' stands for broad singlet. If it's an NH2 group, that would make sense. But in that case, the integration is 2H, which fits an -NH2. However, the IR shows N-H stretches, which are broad, which matches amine or amide. So, if it's an amide, the N-H would be around 3300-3500, which is what's observed.

If the 4.0 ppm is an OCH2, perhaps part of an ethyl ester, like OCH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, the ethyl ester would be OCH2CH3, but that would have a triplet around 1.2 ppm (the CH3) and a quartet around 4.1 ppm (the OCH2). So looking at the NMR data, we have 1.20 (t, 3H) and 4.0 (q, 2H) perhaps? Wait, no, looking at the data:

Wait, the NMR data provided is:

1.20 (t, 3H)

4.0 (bs, 2H)

4.5 (q, 2H)

7.0 (d, 2H)

8.0 (d, 2H)

Wait, wait a second. So the 4.5 ppm is a quartet (q) of 2H. Quartet suggests coupling with three neighboring protons. But 2H as a quartet... Hmm. Maybe a CH2 connected to something else. For example, in an ethyl group, the CH2 next to the oxygen would be a quartet if coupled with the adjacent CH3. So the quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) would be the OCH2 part of an ethyl group, like OCH2CH3. Then the triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H) would be the CH3.

So that suggests an ethyl ester or an ethyl ether. But looking at the options, let's see:

Option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So benzoate ester: the ester group would be OEt (ethyl). So the OCH2CH3 group would have the CH3 as triplet at ~1.2 ppm and the OCH2 as quartet at ~4.2-4.4 ppm. But in the data, the quartet is at 4.5, which is a bit higher than usual. But possible.

Option B is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So this would have an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) as well. The ethoxy's CH3 would be a triplet around 1.2, and the OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.0-4.3. But in the data, the quartet is at 4.5, which is a bit higher. Maybe that's not a perfect fit.

Option C is 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate would be a propanoate ester. So if it's a propyl group, the ester would be OCH2CH2CH3. The protons on the OCH2 would be split into a triplet by the adjacent CH2, but perhaps they are multiplet. Alternatively, maybe the ester is ethyl in this case? Wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. Let's see: 4-aminophenyl propionate would be benzene (6 C) + NH2 (1 C from phenyl) + propionate (3 C). Wait, but the formula is C9H11NO2. So 6 (benzene) + 3 (propionate) + 1 (NH2) = 10 C? Hmm, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. So 9 carbons. Let's see:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzamide is C7H7NO. Then ethoxy is OCH2CH3 (adding 2 C). So total C9H11NO2. That fits.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Phenyl is 6 C, ethoxy adds 2 C, formamide adds 1 C (CHO). So 6+2+1=9 C. So molecular formula would be C9H10NO2? Let me see: phenyl (C6H5), ethoxy (OCH2CH3, which is C2H5O), formamide (HCONH-). Wait, the structure would be HCONH-C6H4-OCH2CH3. So the molecular formula would be C6H5-C2H5-OCH2CH3? No, wait, the formula would be C9H11NO3? Because formamide is CONH2, but in this case, it's attached as RCONH-R'. So the formula for formamide would be Cn+1 H2n+1 N O2? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps each option's molecular formula:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzamide is C7H7NO. Adding ethoxy (OCH2CH3) would add 2 C and 5 H, so total would be C9H12NO2? But the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, perhaps I'm not getting this right. Maybe I should calculate each option.

Option A: Benzamide is C7H7NO. So 3-ethoxy substitution would add an OCH2CH3 group. So the formula would be C7 (benzamide) + C2H5O. So C9, H: 7 (from benzamide) + 5 (from ethoxy) + ... Wait, benzamide is C7H7NO, which is C6H5CONH2. So the ethoxy group would be OCH2CH3, which adds 2 C, 5 H, and one O. So the formula would be C9 H(7+5+ (from CONH2: 2 H))= 7 +5 +2=14 H? Wait, no: benzamide is C7H7NO, which is 7 C, 7 H, 1 N, 1 O. Adding an ethoxy (OCH2CH3) which is 2 C, 5 H, 1 O. So total C:7+2=9. H:7 +5 + 2 (from CONH2? Wait no, CONH2 in benzamide is part of the C7H7NO. So the ethoxy substitution would replace a H on the benzene. So the molecule would be C7H5NO (from benzamide) + C2H5O. So C7 + C2 = C9. H: (benzamide has 7 H, minus one H where ethoxy is attached) → 6 H, plus ethoxy's 5 H → 6 +5 =11 H. O: 1 (from benzamide) +1 (ethoxy) =2 O. N remains 1. So molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Which matches. So option A is correct in formula.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Phenyl is C6H5. Ethoxy is OCH2CH3. Formamide is HCONH- attached to the phenyl. So structure would be HCONH-C6H4-OCH2CH3. The molecular formula would be C6 (phenyl) + 2 (ethoxy) + 2 (formamide: HCONH- is 1 C and 1 O, but wait, HCONH- is from HCONH2, which is formamide. So when attached, perhaps it's HCONH–. Let me think: the formamide group is HCONH–Ph-... Wait, perhaps the structure is Ph-OCH2CH3 with a formamide group attached as N-substituted.

Wait, N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide is HCONH-C6H4-OCH2CH3. So the formula would be:

Phenyl: C6H5.

Formamide: HCONH–, which is C1H2N O.

Ethoxy: OCH2CH3 (C2H5O).

So total C:6 (Ph) +1 (formamide) +2 (ethoxy) =9.

H: let's see:

Ph contributes 5 H (since ethoxy is in position 4 and formamide is in position 1? Or perhaps, the substitution is such that the phenyl has two substituents: OCH2CH3 and HCONH2? No, actually, N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide is where the formamide is attached to the phenyl via the N. So the structure is HCONH–C6H4-OCH2CH3. So the benzene would have two substituents: at position 4, OCH2CH3; and the formamide group is attached to position 1, perhaps. So the H count: benzene has 4 H (since two substituents). The formamide group: HCONH– would have 2 H (the NH2?), but perhaps it's a single H if it's attached differently. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps calculating the formula:

Phenyl (C6H5): C6H5.

Formamide group is HCONH–, which is C1H2N O.

The ethoxy is OCH2CH3: C2H5 O.

So the total formula is C6 + C1 + C2 = C9.

Hydrogen: C6H5 has 5 H. HCONH– has 2 H (the amide NH2). Ethoxy has 5 H (CH2CH3). But wait, the CONH– group: in formamide, the structure is NH2 connected to carbonyl. So when it's N-(substituted)formamide, the structure is RCONH–R', where R is H. So the substituents are R and R' on the NH. So in N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, the structure is HCONH–Ph-OCH2CH3. So the molecule would have:

Ph (C6H5): 5 H.

Formamide: HCONH– which is (from HCO-) 1 H, and the NH would have 2 H (but since it's attached to a phenyl, perhaps it's a secondary amide, so the NH is -NH-Ph-OCH2CH3. Wait, no: formamide is HCONH2. When it's N-aryl, it becomes HCONH–Ar. So the NH is a single H, but is this a secondary amide? So the structure is Ar-NH-CO-H.

Wait, perhaps the HCONH–Ar group has the NH as a single proton. So the HCONH–Ar would contribute 1 H (the amide NH). The ethoxy group contributes 5 H. So total H:

Ph (5) + NH (1) + ethoxy (5) + any others?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think of the formula: each molecule has:

Phenyl (C6H5): 5 H.

Formamide (HCONH–): HCONH– would be C1H3N O. Because HCONH2 is formamide, formula C H3 N O. But when attached as HCONH–Ar, perhaps it's C1H3N O.

Wait, maybe it's better to count all the atoms:

Phenyl: C6H5.

Formamide group: HCONH– (so one C, one O, one N, and two H in the NH (since it's HCONH–, so NH has one H? Or two? Wait, no: HCONH2 is formamide, which has two NH2 protons. But when it's N-substituted (like N-aryl), then it becomes HCONH–Ar, where the NH is attached to the aryl. So the formamide part would contribute HCONH–, which is one C, two O (from CO), one N, and two H (since NH is one H, but the CO has another O). Maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let's instead look at the molecular formula for option B.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.

Phenyl group: 6 C, 5 H.

Ethoxy: OCH2CH3: 2 C, 5 H.

Formamide: HCONH–: 1 C, 2 H (from H and NH?), 1 O, 1 N.

So total C: 6 + 2 +1=9.

H: 5 (phenyl) +5 (ethoxy) + 2 (formamide) =12 H?

Wait, but the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. So 12 H in this option would not fit. So perhaps option B is incorrect.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me recount. N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide has the structure where the formamide is connected to the phenyl via the N. So the structure is HCONH–C6H4–OCH2CH3.

So for the formula:

C: 6 (benzene) + 1 (formamide CO) + 2 (ethoxy) =9.

H: benzene has 5 H (since two substituents: OCH2CH3 and HCONH–). Then, the formamide group's HCONH– contributes 2 H (the H from CO and the NH). The ethoxy contributes 5 H. So total H:5 +2 +5=12. But the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. So that's 12 H in the option, but the compound has only 11. So option B is out.

Hmm, that's a problem. So perhaps option B is not correct.

Moving on to option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate.

Propionate is a carboxylic acid ester, so the structure would be PhNH2-CO-O-R, but wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So the structure would be PhNH2-CO-O-R, where R is propyl? Or maybe it's PhNH2 attached to a propionoate group.

Alternatively, the structure is PhNH2 with a propionoate ester. For example, the ester would be O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 attached to the benzene ring. So the molecular formula would be:

Phenyl (C6H5) → C6H5.

Amino group (NH2): 1 N, 2 H.

Propionate ester (COOCH2CH2CH3): 3 C (from propionate), and 5 H (from CH2CH2CH3).

Wait, but the ester group is O-CO-O-R. So the propionate ester would be O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3.

So let's count:

C:6 (Ph) + 3 (propionate) + N from amine.

H:5 (Ph) +2 (NH2) + 5 (propyl) + others? Wait, the propionate ester is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3. So the ester group itself is O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3. So that's 3 C in the ester.

So total C:6 + 3 =9.

H: Ph has 5 H (since it's para-substituted with NH2 and COOEt? Wait, no, the substituents are NH2 and the propionate ester.

Wait, the structure is 4-aminophenyl propionate, meaning the benzene has an amino group in position 4 and a propionate ester group. So the formula would be:

Ph (C6H5) → 6 C, 5 H.

NH2 → 2 H.

Propionate ester (COOCH2CH2CH3) → 3 C, 5 H (from the propyl group).

O from ester: 2 O.

So total C:6+3=9.

H:5 (Ph) +2 (NH2) +5 (propyl) =12 H. But the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. So 12 H doesn't fit. So option C is out.

Wait, but wait, the propionate ester would have more H. Let me recount.

The ester group is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3. So the propyl group is CH2CH2CH3, which has 7 H in total? Wait, no: CH2CH2CH3 is -CH2-CH2-CH3. That's 2 CH2 groups and a CH3. Each CH2 has 2 H, so 2*2=4, plus the CH3 has 3 H. So total 7 H in the propyl group? No, wait, the propyl group is -O-CH2CH2CH3. So the propyl ester would have 2 H on each CH2 and 3 H on CH3. So 3 CH2 groups? No, the propyl is CH2CH2CH3, so the structure is O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3. So for the propyl group: the CH2 next to O has 2 H, the middle CH2 has 2 H, and the CH3 has 3 H. So total 2+2+3=7 H. But in the ester group, those are all part of the same group. So the entire molecule would have: Ph (5 H) + NH2 (2 H) + ester propyl (7 H) plus any other H from the ester oxygen or the carbonyl. Wait, but the ester group itself (COO-) doesn't contribute H from the carbonyl or the oxygen. So total H would be 5 +2 +7 =14? That can't be right because the molecular formula is C9H11NO2.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the structure. Alternatively, maybe it's not an ester but a carboxylic acid. Let me think again.

Alternatively, 4-aminophenyl propionate could be PhNH2-CO-OCH2CH2CH3. So the structure would have the amino group and the propionate ester as substituents on the benzene. So the formula would be:

Ph (6 C, 5 H).

NH2 (1 N, 2 H).

COOCH2CH2CH3 (3 C, 7 H).

O from COO: 2 O.

So total C:6 +3 =9.

H:5 (Ph) +2 (NH2) +7 (ester) =14 H. But the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. So that's way off, meaning option C is incorrect. Hmm, so perhaps I'm missing something here.

Let's look at option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the structure is PhNH2-COOEt, where Et is ethyl. So the benzoate ester would be OEt (C2H5O), and the amino group is on the benzene ring.

So the formula would be:

Ph (6 C, 5 H).

NH2 (2 H).

COOEt (3 C (COO) + 2 C (Et) =5 C? Wait, the COOEt is O-CO-OCH2CH3. So the COO contributes 2 O, and the Et contributes 2 C. So the benzoate part is:

Benzoate is C7H5NO2. Wait, but I need to count all.

Ph (6 C), COOEt (3 C: COO is from the benzoate, and Et is 2 C, so COOEt is 3 C?), but wait, the benzoate ester is O-CO-OCH2CH3. So the COO is from the benzoic acid, and the Et is from the ethyl ester.

So the formula breakdown:

Ph: 6 C, 5 H.

COOEt: 3 C (COO is from the benzoic acid, so O-CO-O- is part of the benzoate), and the Et is 2 C. So total C:6 +3=9.

H:

Ph:5 H.

COOEt: the ethyl group (OCH2CH3) contributes 5 H (CH3 triplet, CH2 quartet).

The NH2 contributes 2 H.

But the benzoate ester has the COOEt group: the O-CO-OCH2CH3.

So H from COOEt is 5 (from ethyl group).

The NH2 contributes 2 H.

So total H:5 (Ph) +5 (ethyl) +2 (NH2) =12 H.

But the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. So 12 H doesn't match. So option D is also not matching.

Wait, but maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me think again.

Wait, the benzoate ester structure is O-CO-OCH2CH3.

So the ethyl group (OCH2CH3) contributes 5 H: the CH2 has 2 H (but in the ester, it's OCH2CH3), so CH3 is triplet, 3 H.

CH2 is quartet, 2 H.

So the ethyl group contributes 5 H.

The NH2 contributes 2 H.

Ph has 5 H.

So total H:5+5+2=12. But the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. So 12 H doesn't match. So perhaps option D is incorrect.

Hmm, this is confusing. Let me look back at the options and their molecular formulas.

Wait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide.

Benzamide is C7H7NO. Adding ethoxy (OCH2CH3) which is C2H5O. So the formula becomes C9H12NO2. But the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. So that's one H too many. So option A is probably not correct.

Wait, but benzamide (C7H7NO) has 7 H. Adding ethoxy (C2H5O) would replace a H on the benzene. So the total H would be 7-1 +5 (from ethoxy) +1 (from CONH2? Wait, no, because the benzamide is C6H5CONH2. So when we add an ethoxy group, it's C6H4-OCH2CH3-CONH2. So the H count would be:

Ph ring: C6H5 is 5 H. If it's substituted with OCH2CH3 and CONH2, then the ring would have 3 H (since two substituents). Wait, no: benzamide is C6H5-CONH2. So when you have an ethoxy group in position 3, it becomes C6H4-OCH2CH3-CONH2. So the substituents are in positions 3 and 1 (assuming). So the benzene ring would have 4 H (since two substituents), but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the molecular formula more carefully.

Benzamide (C7H7NO): C=7, H=7, N=1, O=1.

Adding ethoxy group (OCH2CH3): C=2, H=5, O=1.

So total:

C:7+2=9.

H:7+5=12. But wait, the benzamide has 7 H, and adding ethoxy would replace one H on the benzene, so 7-1 +5=11. Oh, that makes sense.

So the formula would be C9H11NO2.

Which matches the given formula. So option A has the correct formula.

But earlier, the IR data suggested that the carbonyl peak is at 1720 cm-1, which is more indicative of an ester than an amide. Benzamide's carbonyl is around 1650, so the 1720 peak might not fit. Hmm.

But wait, maybe the substitution pattern affects the carbonyl stretching. For example, electron-withdrawing groups can lower the wavenumber of the carbonyl, but in this case, ethoxy is an electron-donating group, which could lower the carbonyl's wavenumber. So maybe the amide's carbonyl is around 1700, but that's just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the IR data shows a strong band at 1720 cm-1, which is more like an ester. So in that case, options with esters would be more likely. So looking back, option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which is an ester.

So let's reevaluate. The molecular formula for option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Structure: PhNH2-COOEt.

Ph is C6H5, NH2 is 1 N and 2 H, COOEt is O-CO-OCH2CH3 (3 C: COO is from benzoate, and Et is 2 C. So total C:6+3=9.

H: Ph (5 H) + NH2 (2 H) + COOEt (5 H from ethyl group) → 5+2+5=12 H. But the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. So that's 12 H, which doesn't match. So perhaps I made a mistake in counting.

Wait, wait, the formula for benzoate is C7H6O2. Then, when you have ethyl ester, it's C9H10O2. Adding an amino group (NH2) would give C9H11NO2. Because the benzoate is C7H5O2 (if it's benzoic acid, C7H6O2; as ester, it's C7H5O2? Let me think.

Wait, benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Its ethyl ester is C9H10O2. When you add an amino group (NH2), replacing a H, the formula becomes C9H11NO2, which matches. So option D's molecular formula is correct.

So that's a fit.

Now, looking at the NMR data again:

The 1H NMR shows:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H): likely the CH3 of an ethyl group, as it's a triplet.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): perhaps the OCH2 group in the ethyl ester. But the quartet is at 4.5 ppm.

4.5 ppm (q, 2H): quartet, which would be the OCH2 group in the ethyl ester. Because the ethyl ester's OCH2 would couple with the adjacent CH3, giving a quartet. So 4.5 ppm (q, 2H) is the OCH2.

So in option D, the structure is O-CO-OCH2CH3 attached to the benzene ring with an amino group.

The NMR would show:

The ethyl group: CH3 as triplet at 1.20, and OCH2 as quartet at 4.5.

The amino group's protons would appear as a broad peak. So the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) could be the NH2 group. But wait, in the NMR, the 4.0 is a singlet, broad, integrating to 2H. That would be the NH2 protons. But amine protons usually appear around 1-5 ppm, and as a broad peak. So that fits.

Now, looking at the aromatic protons.

The NMR shows:

7.0 ppm (d, 2H)

8.0 ppm (d, 2H)

This suggests a para-substituted benzene ring, as the doublets indicate coupling between adjacent protons. For example, in a para-disubstituted benzene, the two protons ortho to substituents would be as doublets.

In option D, the substituents are NH2 and COOEt in para positions. So the aromatic protons would be two sets of doublets: the two H ortho to NH2 and the two H ortho to COOEt.

The NH2 is an electron-withdrawing group (due to the amino group being slightly deactivating), which would cause the adjacent protons to be deshielded and appear downfield. The COOEt group is an electron-withdrawing group (ester), which would also deshield the adjacent protons.

In the NMR, the higher ppm (8.0) would be the protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing group (COOEt), and the lower ppm (7.0) would be adjacent to the NH2 group.

So the aromatic region fits a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, each causing their adjacent protons to split into doublets.

Putting it all together, the NMR data fits option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

But earlier, the IR suggested an ester carbonyl, which fits. The amide's carbonyl would have a lower wavenumber. So the 1720 cm-1 supports an ester.

So the correct answer should be option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The compound has the molecular formula **C9H11NO2**, and the IR and 1H NMR data were analyzed to identify it. The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as 5, indicating the presence of a benzene ring (4 DoU) and one additional double bond, likely from a carbonyl group. 

### IR Analysis:
- **Medium to strong bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** suggest the presence of N-H bonds, likely from an amide or amine group.
- **Strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹** indicates a carbonyl group. This wavenumber is more consistent with an ester (1720 cm⁻¹) than an amide (typically 1650–1680 cm⁻¹).

### 1H NMR Analysis:
1. **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet integrating to 3H, characteristic of a CH3 group in an ethyl group.
2. **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet integrating to 2H, likely corresponding to NH2 protons.
3. **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: A quartet integrating to 2H, characteristic of the OCH2 group in an ethyl ester.
4. **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, indicating a para-substituted benzene ring with two substituents causing coupling.

### Option Analysis:
1. **Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide**  
   - Contains an amide group, which would have a carbonyl peak around 1650–1680 cm⁻¹, inconsistent with the IR data (1720 cm⁻¹).  
   - **Eliminated** due to mismatch with IR.

2. **Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**  
   - Contains a formamide group, which would have a carbonyl peak around 1680–1700 cm⁻¹, slightly lower than the observed 1720 cm⁻¹.  
   - The molecular formula does not match (would have 12 H instead of 11 H).  
   - **Eliminated** due to mismatch with molecular formula and IR.

3. **Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate**  
   - Contains a propionate ester, which would have a carbonyl peak around 1720 cm⁻¹, consistent with the IR data.  
   - However, the molecular formula does not match (would have 14 H instead of 11 H).  
   - **Eliminated** due to mismatch with molecular formula.

4. **Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**  
   - Contains an ethyl ester (consistent with the IR carbonyl peak at 1720 cm⁻¹) and a para-substituted benzene ring (consistent with the aromatic NMR signals).  
   - The ethyl group explains the triplet at 1.20 ppm (CH3) and the quartet at 4.5 ppm (OCH2).  
   - The NH2 group explains the broad singlet at 4.0 ppm.  
   - The molecular formula **C9H11NO2** matches perfectly.  
   - **Correct choice** as it fits all spectral data and molecular formula.

### Conclusion:
The compound is identified as **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate** based on the IR, NMR, and molecular formula. 

Answer: D

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is to identify a compound based on its IR and 1H NMR data. The molecular formula given is C9H11NO2. Let's see what the options are and how the spectral data can help narrow it down.

First, I'll look at the molecular formula: C9H11NO2. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. The formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=9, H=11, N=1, O=2 (but O doesn't count here). So it's (2*9 + 2 -11 +1)/2 = (20-11+1)/2 = (10)/2 = 5. So five degrees: possibly a benzene ring (3 double bonds or 3 rings, but benzene is a ring with three double bonds, which counts as 4 degrees—wait, no, benzene is a six-membered ring with three double bonds. Wait, a benzene ring has three double bonds, which is three degrees. Hmm, wait, no, each ring or double bond is one degree. So benzene would have three double bonds, contributing three degrees. Then, each ring also counts as one degree. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think again.

Wait, degree of unsaturation for benzene. Benzene has six carbons in a ring, with three double bonds. Each double bond is one degree, each ring is another. No, wait, no, each ring or each pi bond is one degree. So a benzene ring has three double bonds and one ring, but that's not right. Wait, no. Wait a benzene ring is a single ring with three double bonds. Each ring is one degree, each pi bond is another. So benzene has one ring and three pi bonds, but wait, that would be four degrees. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the formula for degree of unsaturation (DoU) is each double bond (including rings) is one DoU. So a benzene ring is a six-membered ring with three double bonds. Each double bond (or ring) counts as one. So benzene has three double bonds and one ring? No, a benzene ring is a single ring with three double bonds, so that's 4 DoU? Wait I think I'm mixing things up. Wait another approach: Each ring contributes one DoU, each pi bond (like in alkenes, alkynes, aromatic rings) contributes one. So a benzene ring has three pi bonds (from the double bonds) and one ring, totaling four DoU. But our molecule has a DoU of 5. So the rest is one more DoU, which could be an amide group (which has a double bond) or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzene ring is present, contributing four DoU, and then another double bond elsewhere, making total five. So perhaps an amide group, which is a carbonyl (another double bond), but that would make it five DoU. Or maybe an ester group.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzamide is a benzene ring with an amide group. So benzamide would have the benzene ring (4 DoU) and the amide (another double bond, so 5 DoU). The ethoxy might contribute an oxygen but doesn't add to DoU. So that fits: 5 DoU.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide has a formyl group (CHO) attached as an amide. So again, benzene (4) plus amide (1) gives 5. So fits.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate is a carboxylic acid ester (like -OAc or similar). Wait, the structure would be benzene with an amino group and a propionoate (COO-) group. So benzene (4), the amino group doesn't add, but the ester or carboxylic acid group would have a carbonyl, adding another DoU. So 5 DoU as well.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Benzoate is a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid ester group. So benzene (4) plus ester (which has a carbonyl, another DoU), making total 5. So all options fit the DoU.

Now looking at the IR data. The IR shows strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. These are likely N-H stretches. Amide N-H's are usually broad and around 3300-3500. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, such as an amide or ester. Amide carbonyls are typically around 1650-1700, while esters are higher, around 1720-1750. So the 1720 peak could indicate an ester or possibly an amide.

Wait, but amide carbonyls are usually lower. Let me think. In amides, the carbonyl is usually around 1640-1680 cm-1 because of resonance with the N-H. Ester carbonyls are higher, 1720-1750. So a peak at 1720 is more indicative of an ester or possibly a ketone. So which options have esters or amides?

Option A: Benzamide. The amide would have a carbonyl around 1650. But the IR here is 1720. Hmm, that's higher, which would suggest an ester, not an amide. So maybe A is not correct.

Option B: Formamide. Formamides have a carbonyl around 1680-1700. So 1720 is a bit high, but maybe it's a substituted formamide. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester.

Option C: Propionate ester. So the carbonyl would be around 1720, which matches the IR. So C's ester carbonyl would fit.

Option D: Benzoate ester. The carbonyl from the ester would be around 1720, so that's a fit.

So the IR suggests either a formamide (but not matching 1720) or an ester. Maybe the 1720 is more indicative of an ester.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H): likely a methyl group attached to an oxygen, like an ethyl group's CH2CH3. The triplet suggests coupling with two protons, so probably a CH2CH3 group, ethyl.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): broad singlet, 2H. Maybe an OCH2 group, or maybe adjacent to an oxygen. Alternatively, could be NH2 protons, but they're usually broad and around 1-5 ppm. But the integration is 2H, so maybe CH2 connected to something else, like an oxygen.

Wait, but the IR has strong N-H bands, so perhaps those are from an amide or amine. The NMR shows 4.0 ppm as a broad singlet, 2H. Maybe it's an NH2 group, but the integration is 2H, which would suggest two protons. Alternatively, maybe it's an OCH2 group. But the shift is around 4.0, which is typical for OCH2.

But let's think. The 4.0 ppm peak is a broad singlet. The 'bs' stands for broad singlet. If it's an NH2 group, that would make sense. But in that case, the integration is 2H, which fits an -NH2. However, the IR shows N-H stretches, which are broad, which matches amine or amide. So, if it's an amide, the N-H would be around 3300-3500, which is what's observed.

If the 4.0 ppm is an OCH2, perhaps part of an ethyl ester, like OCH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, the ethyl ester would be OCH2CH3, but that would have a triplet around 1.2 ppm (the CH3) and a quartet around 4.1 ppm (the OCH2). So looking at the NMR data, we have 1.20 (t, 3H) and 4.0 (q, 2H) perhaps? Wait, no, looking at the data:

Wait, the NMR data provided is:

1.20 (t, 3H)

4.0 (bs, 2H)

4.5 (q, 2H)

7.0 (d, 2H)

8.0 (d, 2H)

Wait, wait a second. So the 4.5 ppm is a quartet (q) of 2H. Quartet suggests coupling with three neighboring protons. But 2H as a quartet... Hmm. Maybe a CH2 connected to something else. For example, in an ethyl group, the CH2 next to the oxygen would be a quartet if coupled with the adjacent CH3. So the quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) would be the OCH2 part of an ethyl group, like OCH2CH3. Then the triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H) would be the CH3.

So that suggests an ethyl ester or an ethyl ether. But looking at the options, let's see:

Option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So benzoate ester: the ester group would be OEt (ethyl). So the OCH2CH3 group would have the CH3 as triplet at ~1.2 ppm and the OCH2 as quartet at ~4.2-4.4 ppm. But in the data, the quartet is at 4.5, which is a bit higher than usual. But possible.

Option B is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So this would have an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) as well. The ethoxy's CH3 would be a triplet around 1.2, and the OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.0-4.3. But in the data, the quartet is at 4.5, which is a bit higher. Maybe that's not a perfect fit.

Option C is 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate would be a propanoate ester. So if it's a propyl group, the ester would be OCH2CH2CH3. The protons on the OCH2 would be split into a triplet by the adjacent CH2, but perhaps they are multiplet. Alternatively, maybe the ester is ethyl in this case? Wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. Let's see: 4-aminophenyl propionate would be benzene (6 C) + NH2 (1 C from phenyl) + propionate (3 C). Wait, but the formula is C9H11NO2. So 6 (benzene) + 3 (propionate) + 1 (NH2) = 10 C? Hmm, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. So 9 carbons. Let's see:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzamide is C7H7NO. Then ethoxy is OCH2CH3 (adding 2 C). So total C9H11NO2. That fits.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Phenyl is 6 C, ethoxy adds 2 C, formamide adds 1 C (CHO). So 6+2+1=9 C. So molecular formula would be C9H10NO2? Let me see: phenyl (C6H5), ethoxy (OCH2CH3, which is C2H5O), formamide (HCONH-). Wait, the structure would be HCONH-C6H4-OCH2CH3. So the molecular formula would be C6H5-C2H5-OCH2CH3? No, wait, the formula would be C9H11NO3? Because formamide is CONH2, but in this case, it's attached as RCONH-R'. So the formula for formamide would be Cn+1 H2n+1 N O2? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps each option's molecular formula:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzamide is C7H7NO. Adding ethoxy (OCH2CH3) would add 2 C and 5 H, so total would be C9H12NO2? But the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, perhaps I'm not getting this right. Maybe I should calculate each option.

Option A: Benzamide is C7H7NO. So 3-ethoxy substitution would add an OCH2CH3 group. So the formula would be C7 (benzamide) + C2H5O. So C9, H: 7 (from benzamide) + 5 (from ethoxy) + ... Wait, benzamide is C7H7NO, which is C6H5CONH2. So the ethoxy group would be OCH2CH3, which adds 2 C, 5 H, and one O. So the formula would be C9 H(7+5+ (from CONH2: 2 H))= 7 +5 +2=14 H? Wait, no: benzamide is C7H7NO, which is 7 C, 7 H, 1 N, 1 O. Adding an ethoxy (OCH2CH3) which is 2 C, 5 H, 1 O. So total C:7+2=9. H:7 +5 + 2 (from CONH2? Wait no, CONH2 in benzamide is part of the C7H7NO. So the ethoxy substitution would replace a H on the benzene. So the molecule would be C7H5NO (from benzamide) + C2H5O. So C7 + C2 = C9. H: (benzamide has 7 H, minus one H where ethoxy is attached) → 6 H, plus ethoxy's 5 H → 6 +5 =11 H. O: 1 (from benzamide) +1 (ethoxy) =2 O. N remains 1. So molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Which matches. So option A is correct in formula.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Phenyl is C6H5. Ethoxy is OCH2CH3. Formamide is HCONH- attached to the phenyl. So structure would be HCONH-C6H4-OCH2CH3. The molecular formula would be C6 (phenyl) + 2 (ethoxy) + 2 (formamide: HCONH- is 1 C and 1 O, but wait, HCONH- is from HCONH2, which is formamide. So when attached, perhaps it's HCONH–. Let me think: the formamide group is HCONH–Ph-... Wait, perhaps the structure is Ph-OCH2CH3 with a formamide group attached as N-substituted.

Wait, N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide is HCONH-C6H4-OCH2CH3. So the formula would be:

Phenyl: C6H5.

Formamide: HCONH–, which is C1H2N O.

Ethoxy: OCH2CH3 (C2H5O).

So total C:6 (Ph) +1 (formamide) +2 (ethoxy) =9.

H: let's see:

Ph contributes 5 H (since ethoxy is in position 4 and formamide is in position 1? Or perhaps, the substitution is such that the phenyl has two substituents: OCH2CH3 and HCONH2? No, actually, N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide is where the formamide is attached to the phenyl via the N. So the structure is HCONH–C6H4-OCH2CH3. So the benzene would have two substituents: at position 4, OCH2CH3; and the formamide group is attached to position 1, perhaps. So the H count: benzene has 4 H (since two substituents). The formamide group: HCONH– would have 2 H (the NH2?), but perhaps it's a single H if it's attached differently. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps calculating the formula:

Phenyl (C6H5): C6H5.

Formamide group is HCONH–, which is C1H2N O.

The ethoxy is OCH2CH3: C2H5 O.

So the total formula is C6 + C1 + C2 = C9.

Hydrogen: C6H5 has 5 H. HCONH– has 2 H (the amide NH2). Ethoxy has 5 H (CH2CH3). But wait, the CONH– group: in formamide, the structure is NH2 connected to carbonyl. So when it's N-(substituted)formamide, the structure is RCONH–R', where R is H. So the substituents are R and R' on the NH. So in N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, the structure is HCONH–Ph-OCH2CH3. So the molecule would have:

Ph (C6H5): 5 H.

Formamide: HCONH– which is (from HCO-) 1 H, and the NH would have 2 H (but since it's attached to a phenyl, perhaps it's a secondary amide, so the NH is -NH-Ph-OCH2CH3. Wait, no: formamide is HCONH2. When it's N-aryl, it becomes HCONH–Ar. So the NH is a single H, but is this a secondary amide? So the structure is Ar-NH-CO-H.

Wait, perhaps the HCONH–Ar group has the NH as a single proton. So the HCONH–Ar would contribute 1 H (the amide NH). The ethoxy group contributes 5 H. So total H:

Ph (5) + NH (1) + ethoxy (5) + any others?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think of the formula: each molecule has:

Phenyl (C6H5): 5 H.

Formamide (HCONH–): HCONH– would be C1H3N O. Because HCONH2 is formamide, formula C H3 N O. But when attached as HCONH–Ar, perhaps it's C1H3N O.

Wait, maybe it's better to count all the atoms:

Phenyl: C6H5.

Formamide group: HCONH– (so one C, one O, one N, and two H in the NH (since it's HCONH–, so NH has one H? Or two? Wait, no: HCONH2 is formamide, which has two NH2 protons. But when it's N-substituted (like N-aryl), then it becomes HCONH–Ar, where the NH is attached to the aryl. So the formamide part would contribute HCONH–, which is one C, two O (from CO), one N, and two H (since NH is one H, but the CO has another O). Maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let's instead look at the molecular formula for option B.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.

Phenyl group: 6 C, 5 H.

Ethoxy: OCH2CH3: 2 C, 5 H.

Formamide: HCONH–: 1 C, 2 H (from H and NH?), 1 O, 1 N.

So total C: 6 + 2 +1=9.

H: 5 (phenyl) +5 (ethoxy) + 2 (formamide) =12 H?

Wait, but the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. So 12 H in this option would not fit. So perhaps option B is incorrect.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me recount. N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide has the structure where the formamide is connected to the phenyl via the N. So the structure is HCONH–C6H4–OCH2CH3.

So for the formula:

C: 6 (benzene) + 1 (formamide CO) + 2 (ethoxy) =9.

H: benzene has 5 H (since two substituents: OCH2CH3 and HCONH–). Then, the formamide group's HCONH– contributes 2 H (the H from CO and the NH). The ethoxy contributes 5 H. So total H:5 +2 +5=12. But the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. So that's 12 H in the option, but the compound has only 11. So option B is out.

Hmm, that's a problem. So perhaps option B is not correct.

Moving on to option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate.

Propionate is a carboxylic acid ester, so the structure would be PhNH2-CO-O-R, but wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So the structure would be PhNH2-CO-O-R, where R is propyl? Or maybe it's PhNH2 attached to a propionoate group.

Alternatively, the structure is PhNH2 with a propionoate ester. For example, the ester would be O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 attached to the benzene ring. So the molecular formula would be:

Phenyl (C6H5) → C6H5.

Amino group (NH2): 1 N, 2 H.

Propionate ester (COOCH2CH2CH3): 3 C (from propionate), and 5 H (from CH2CH2CH3).

Wait, but the ester group is O-CO-O-R. So the propionate ester would be O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3.

So let's count:

C:6 (Ph) + 3 (propionate) + N from amine.

H:5 (Ph) +2 (NH2) + 5 (propyl) + others? Wait, the propionate ester is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3. So the ester group itself is O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3. So that's 3 C in the ester.

So total C:6 + 3 =9.

H: Ph has 5 H (since it's para-substituted with NH2 and COOEt? Wait, no, the substituents are NH2 and the propionate ester.

Wait, the structure is 4-aminophenyl propionate, meaning the benzene has an amino group in position 4 and a propionate ester group. So the formula would be:

Ph (C6H5) → 6 C, 5 H.

NH2 → 2 H.

Propionate ester (COOCH2CH2CH3) → 3 C, 5 H (from the propyl group).

O from ester: 2 O.

So total C:6+3=9.

H:5 (Ph) +2 (NH2) +5 (propyl) =12 H. But the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. So 12 H doesn't fit. So option C is out.

Wait, but wait, the propionate ester would have more H. Let me recount.

The ester group is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3. So the propyl group is CH2CH2CH3, which has 7 H in total? Wait, no: CH2CH2CH3 is -CH2-CH2-CH3. That's 2 CH2 groups and a CH3. Each CH2 has 2 H, so 2*2=4, plus the CH3 has 3 H. So total 7 H in the propyl group? No, wait, the propyl group is -O-CH2CH2CH3. So the propyl ester would have 2 H on each CH2 and 3 H on CH3. So 3 CH2 groups? No, the propyl is CH2CH2CH3, so the structure is O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3. So for the propyl group: the CH2 next to O has 2 H, the middle CH2 has 2 H, and the CH3 has 3 H. So total 2+2+3=7 H. But in the ester group, those are all part of the same group. So the entire molecule would have: Ph (5 H) + NH2 (2 H) + ester propyl (7 H) plus any other H from the ester oxygen or the carbonyl. Wait, but the ester group itself (COO-) doesn't contribute H from the carbonyl or the oxygen. So total H would be 5 +2 +7 =14? That can't be right because the molecular formula is C9H11NO2.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the structure. Alternatively, maybe it's not an ester but a carboxylic acid. Let me think again.

Alternatively, 4-aminophenyl propionate could be PhNH2-CO-OCH2CH2CH3. So the structure would have the amino group and the propionate ester as substituents on the benzene. So the formula would be:

Ph (6 C, 5 H).

NH2 (1 N, 2 H).

COOCH2CH2CH3 (3 C, 7 H).

O from COO: 2 O.

So total C:6 +3 =9.

H:5 (Ph) +2 (NH2) +7 (ester) =14 H. But the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. So that's way off, meaning option C is incorrect. Hmm, so perhaps I'm missing something here.

Let's look at option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the structure is PhNH2-COOEt, where Et is ethyl. So the benzoate ester would be OEt (C2H5O), and the amino group is on the benzene ring.

So the formula would be:

Ph (6 C, 5 H).

NH2 (2 H).

COOEt (3 C (COO) + 2 C (Et) =5 C? Wait, the COOEt is O-CO-OCH2CH3. So the COO contributes 2 O, and the Et contributes 2 C. So the benzoate part is:

Benzoate is C7H5NO2. Wait, but I need to count all.

Ph (6 C), COOEt (3 C: COO is from the benzoate, and Et is 2 C, so COOEt is 3 C?), but wait, the benzoate ester is O-CO-OCH2CH3. So the COO is from the benzoic acid, and the Et is from the ethyl ester.

So the formula breakdown:

Ph: 6 C, 5 H.

COOEt: 3 C (COO is from the benzoic acid, so O-CO-O- is part of the benzoate), and the Et is 2 C. So total C:6 +3=9.

H:

Ph:5 H.

COOEt: the ethyl group (OCH2CH3) contributes 5 H (CH3 triplet, CH2 quartet).

The NH2 contributes 2 H.

But the benzoate ester has the COOEt group: the O-CO-OCH2CH3.

So H from COOEt is 5 (from ethyl group).

The NH2 contributes 2 H.

So total H:5 (Ph) +5 (ethyl) +2 (NH2) =12 H.

But the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. So 12 H doesn't match. So option D is also not matching.

Wait, but maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me think again.

Wait, the benzoate ester structure is O-CO-OCH2CH3.

So the ethyl group (OCH2CH3) contributes 5 H: the CH2 has 2 H (but in the ester, it's OCH2CH3), so CH3 is triplet, 3 H.

CH2 is quartet, 2 H.

So the ethyl group contributes 5 H.

The NH2 contributes 2 H.

Ph has 5 H.

So total H:5+5+2=12. But the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. So 12 H doesn't match. So perhaps option D is incorrect.

Hmm, this is confusing. Let me look back at the options and their molecular formulas.

Wait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide.

Benzamide is C7H7NO. Adding ethoxy (OCH2CH3) which is C2H5O. So the formula becomes C9H12NO2. But the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. So that's one H too many. So option A is probably not correct.

Wait, but benzamide (C7H7NO) has 7 H. Adding ethoxy (C2H5O) would replace a H on the benzene. So the total H would be 7-1 +5 (from ethoxy) +1 (from CONH2? Wait, no, because the benzamide is C6H5CONH2. So when we add an ethoxy group, it's C6H4-OCH2CH3-CONH2. So the H count would be:

Ph ring: C6H5 is 5 H. If it's substituted with OCH2CH3 and CONH2, then the ring would have 3 H (since two substituents). Wait, no: benzamide is C6H5-CONH2. So when you have an ethoxy group in position 3, it becomes C6H4-OCH2CH3-CONH2. So the substituents are in positions 3 and 1 (assuming). So the benzene ring would have 4 H (since two substituents), but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the molecular formula more carefully.

Benzamide (C7H7NO): C=7, H=7, N=1, O=1.

Adding ethoxy group (OCH2CH3): C=2, H=5, O=1.

So total:

C:7+2=9.

H:7+5=12. But wait, the benzamide has 7 H, and adding ethoxy would replace one H on the benzene, so 7-1 +5=11. Oh, that makes sense.

So the formula would be C9H11NO2.

Which matches the given formula. So option A has the correct formula.

But earlier, the IR data suggested that the carbonyl peak is at 1720 cm-1, which is more indicative of an ester than an amide. Benzamide's carbonyl is around 1650, so the 1720 peak might not fit. Hmm.

But wait, maybe the substitution pattern affects the carbonyl stretching. For example, electron-withdrawing groups can lower the wavenumber of the carbonyl, but in this case, ethoxy is an electron-donating group, which could lower the carbonyl's wavenumber. So maybe the amide's carbonyl is around 1700, but that's just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the IR data shows a strong band at 1720 cm-1, which is more like an ester. So in that case, options with esters would be more likely. So looking back, option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which is an ester.

So let's reevaluate. The molecular formula for option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Structure: PhNH2-COOEt.

Ph is C6H5, NH2 is 1 N and 2 H, COOEt is O-CO-OCH2CH3 (3 C: COO is from benzoate, and Et is 2 C. So total C:6+3=9.

H: Ph (5 H) + NH2 (2 H) + COOEt (5 H from ethyl group) → 5+2+5=12 H. But the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. So that's 12 H, which doesn't match. So perhaps I made a mistake in counting.

Wait, wait, the formula for benzoate is C7H6O2. Then, when you have ethyl ester, it's C9H10O2. Adding an amino group (NH2) would give C9H11NO2. Because the benzoate is C7H5O2 (if it's benzoic acid, C7H6O2; as ester, it's C7H5O2? Let me think.

Wait, benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Its ethyl ester is C9H10O2. When you add an amino group (NH2), replacing a H, the formula becomes C9H11NO2, which matches. So option D's molecular formula is correct.

So that's a fit.

Now, looking at the NMR data again:

The 1H NMR shows:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H): likely the CH3 of an ethyl group, as it's a triplet.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): perhaps the OCH2 group in the ethyl ester. But the quartet is at 4.5 ppm.

4.5 ppm (q, 2H): quartet, which would be the OCH2 group in the ethyl ester. Because the ethyl ester's OCH2 would couple with the adjacent CH3, giving a quartet. So 4.5 ppm (q, 2H) is the OCH2.

So in option D, the structure is O-CO-OCH2CH3 attached to the benzene ring with an amino group.

The NMR would show:

The ethyl group: CH3 as triplet at 1.20, and OCH2 as quartet at 4.5.

The amino group's protons would appear as a broad peak. So the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) could be the NH2 group. But wait, in the NMR, the 4.0 is a singlet, broad, integrating to 2H. That would be the NH2 protons. But amine protons usually appear around 1-5 ppm, and as a broad peak. So that fits.

Now, looking at the aromatic protons.

The NMR shows:

7.0 ppm (d, 2H)

8.0 ppm (d, 2H)

This suggests a para-substituted benzene ring, as the doublets indicate coupling between adjacent protons. For example, in a para-disubstituted benzene, the two protons ortho to substituents would be as doublets.

In option D, the substituents are NH2 and COOEt in para positions. So the aromatic protons would be two sets of doublets: the two H ortho to NH2 and the two H ortho to COOEt.

The NH2 is an electron-withdrawing group (due to the amino group being slightly deactivating), which would cause the adjacent protons to be deshielded and appear downfield. The COOEt group is an electron-withdrawing group (ester), which would also deshield the adjacent protons.

In the NMR, the higher ppm (8.0) would be the protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing group (COOEt), and the lower ppm (7.0) would be adjacent to the NH2 group.

So the aromatic region fits a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, each causing their adjacent protons to split into doublets.

Putting it all together, the NMR data fits option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

But earlier, the IR suggested an ester carbonyl, which fits. The amide's carbonyl would have a lower wavenumber. So the 1720 cm-1 supports an ester.

So the correct answer should be option D.


The compound has the molecular formula **C9H11NO2**, and the IR and 1H NMR data were analyzed to identify it. The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as 5, indicating the presence of a benzene ring (4 DoU) and one additional double bond, likely from a carbonyl group. 

### IR Analysis:
- **Medium to strong bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** suggest the presence of N-H bonds, likely from an amide or amine group.
- **Strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹** indicates a carbonyl group. This wavenumber is more consistent with an ester (1720 cm⁻¹) than an amide (typically 1650–1680 cm⁻¹).

### 1H NMR Analysis:
1. **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet integrating to 3H, characteristic of a CH3 group in an ethyl group.
2. **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet integrating to 2H, likely corresponding to NH2 protons.
3. **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: A quartet integrating to 2H, characteristic of the OCH2 group in an ethyl ester.
4. **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, indicating a para-substituted benzene ring with two substituents causing coupling.

### Option Analysis:
1. **Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide**  
   - Contains an amide group, which would have a carbonyl peak around 1650–1680 cm⁻¹, inconsistent with the IR data (1720 cm⁻¹).  
   - **Eliminated** due to mismatch with IR.

2. **Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**  
   - Contains a formamide group, which would have a carbonyl peak around 1680–1700 cm⁻¹, slightly lower than the observed 1720 cm⁻¹.  
   - The molecular formula does not match (would have 12 H instead of 11 H).  
   - **Eliminated** due to mismatch with molecular formula and IR.

3. **Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate**  
   - Contains a propionate ester, which would have a carbonyl peak around 1720 cm⁻¹, consistent with the IR data.  
   - However, the molecular formula does not match (would have 14 H instead of 11 H).  
   - **Eliminated** due to mismatch with molecular formula.

4. **Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**  
   - Contains an ethyl ester (consistent with the IR carbonyl peak at 1720 cm⁻¹) and a para-substituted benzene ring (consistent with the aromatic NMR signals).  
   - The ethyl group explains the triplet at 1.20 ppm (CH3) and the quartet at 4.5 ppm (OCH2).  
   - The NH2 group explains the broad singlet at 4.0 ppm.  
   - The molecular formula **C9H11NO2** matches perfectly.  
   - **Correct choice** as it fits all spectral data and molecular formula.

### Conclusion:
The compound is identified as **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate** based on the IR, NMR, and molecular formula.
