Okay, so I have this question about molecular biology techniques and mouse models. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells and their developmental fate. They've used a bicistronic lox-Cre vector, which means it has two coding regions under a single promoter, right? So the ligand and receptor are both being expressed from this construct.

The vector setup: the ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end with eGFP at the C-terminus. So the ligand is first in the mRNA, followed by the receptor. There are stop cassettes between them. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter, and the receptor has an IRES element upstream. IRES elements allow internal ribosome entry, so the receptor can be translated as a separate protein after the ligand.

Wait, but in a bicistronic construct, how does the translation work? Typically, the first ORF (ligand) is translated, and then the ribosome might disengage, but the IRES allows the second ORF (receptor) to be translated without the need for a full stop and new start. Oh, but in this setup, the ligand is under CBA, and the receptor is after an IRES. So the CBA promoter drives both, but the IRES helps in the translation of the receptor.

They used stop cassettes with loxP and lox2272. Oh right, because Cre recombinase can recognize these sites. So in the absence of Cre, the stop cassettes are in place, preventing the fusion of mCherry with ligand (since ligand has a stop before mCherry, and maybe the same for the receptor and eGFP). But when Cre is present, it recombines the lox sites, removing the stop cassettes, allowing the mCherry and eGFP to be expressed as fusion proteins with ligand and receptor, respectively.

So the setup is for Cre to excise the stops when present. So in the Cre-expressing cells, the ligand will be fused to mCherry, and the receptor to eGFP.

They transfected the plasmid into primary astrocyte culture and used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins on a Western blot. They saw signals proportional to actin, which suggests the blot is working correctly because actin is a loading control.

Now, they made a mouse model homozygous for this construct in a wild-type background. Then they crossed these mice to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, so the Cre is probably under the control of SOX10, meaning it's expressed in neural crest-derived cells. The idea is that Cre would recombine the lox sites, allowing the ligand and receptor to be expressed with the fluorescent tags.

But when they looked under the confocal microscope, there was no green signal. The eGFP is on the receptor, so no green would mean the receptor-eGFP isn't being expressed, or isn't fluorescent for some reason.

Looking at the options:

A) ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. If that's the case, maybe they aren't expressed in the same cell, but in the construct, both are under the same promoter, so they should be co-expressed. But wait, the question says the mouse is homozygous for the construct. So each allele would have the same. But when crossed with SOX10-Cre, which is a hemizygous, does that matter? I'm not sure. If the Cre is only active in certain cells, perhaps only some cells express the fluorescent proteins. But the question says they don't see any green signal, not just in some cells. So maybe this isn't the issue.

B) The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. The Golgi is involved in protein processing. If the construct is stuck here, the eGFP wouldn't be on the cell surface, so you wouldn't see fluorescence. But why would that happen only in this case? The vector was tested in astrocytes, and presumably they saw the proteins on Western blot. Wait, the Western blot uses total proteins—so if the receptor-eGFP is made but stuck in the ER or Golgi, it would still show up on the blot because it's present in the cell. But during immunostaining, it might not reach the cell surface, so you wouldn't see fluorescence. But if the blot shows the protein is present, then maybe this is a possibility. But the question says they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins on the Western. So if the Western blot shows a band, but the fluorescence isn't there, maybe it's a processing issue. Alternatively, maybe the eGFP isn't being expressed at all.

C) The enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. The construct uses the CBA promoter for the ligand, and IRES for the receptor. CBA is a strong promoter, so if the construct is correctly inserted, the enhancers shouldn't be the issue. Unless the vector lacks necessary regulatory elements. But the question says the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong constitutive promoter, so expression shouldn't be lacking because of enhancers.

D) The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. Oh, this is about the ORF. If the receptor's C-terminus is fused to eGFP, but the stop cassette wasn't properly removed, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. Or perhaps the frame is wrong. Wait, when Cre is present, it removes the stop cassette, allowing the receptor to be in frame with eGFP. If the reading frame isn't correct, the eGFP might not be expressed, or the receptor could be truncated.

So in the setup, the ligand is under CBA, then the stop cassette with loxP, then the receptor, then after the receptor, another stop cassette with lox2272, and then eGFP. Wait, the way it's described: between ligand ORF and mCherry is a stop in a loxP cassette. Similarly, between receptor and eGFP, stop in lox2272. So after Cre recombination, the stop cassettes are removed, allowing the ligand to be expressed as ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP.

Wait, but in the vector, the ligand is at 5', then the stop, then the receptor, then another stop, then eGFP. So for the receptor-eGFP to be expressed, Cre must recombine the lox2272 sites, allowing the receptor to be in frame with eGFP.

Wait, but if the stop cassette after the receptor is using lox2272, and the Cre is SOX10-Cre, which probably uses loxP sites. Wait, no, lox2272 is a variant of the loxP site, recognized by Cre. So if the Cre can recognize both loxP and lox2272, then both stops would be excised.

Wait, but in our case, the ligand is under loxP-stop-loxP, and the receptor is under lox2272-stop-lox2272. So when Cre is present, both stops are removed, allowing the ligand to be expressed as ligand-mCherry, and the receptor as receptor-eGFP.

But in the mouse, the Cre (from SOX10-Cre) would only be active in neural crest-derived cells. So in those cells, the stops should be removed, and the constructs should be expressed.

But when they look, they see no green. So why?

Looking back at the options, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. That would mean that when the stop is removed, the reading frame is incorrect, so eGFP isn't expressed, or the receptor is truncated, making the eGFP not properly expressed.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES element is not working. Wait, the receptor is under the IRES, which is after the ligand's ORF. So the CBA promoter drives the entire mRNA, and the IRES allows the ribosome to switch to the receptor's ORF. But if the IRES isn't functional, then the receptor might not be expressed.

Wait, but the vector is designed so that the ligand is under CBA, and the receptor is under IRES. So when the stop is removed, the receptor would be expressed as a separate protein.

Wait, but the Western blot would show whether the proteins are present. So if both ligand and receptor are expressed, their antibodies would detect them. But in the mouse, the problem is that the eGFP isn't fluorescing. So perhaps the eGFP isn't being expressed. If the stop cassette wasn't properly removed, then the receptor wouldn't be expressed, but why would the Western blot show the presence of proteins? Hmm, but the Western blot was done after transfection in astrocytes, not in the mouse. So perhaps the issue arises in the mouse construct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that in the mouse, the Cre isn't efficiently excising the lox sites, so the stop remains, and thus the receptor and eGFP aren't expressed.

Wait, but the mouse is crossed with SOX10-Cre, which should activate Cre in neural crest cells, leading to excision.

But in the absence of Cre, the stop cassettes are in place, so the ligand and receptor wouldn't be expressed with the fluorescent tags. But in the mouse, they're homozygous for the construct, and crossed to SOX10-Cre, which is a hemizygous. So in the offspring, they should have Cre active in the neural crest.

Wait, but when they look, they see no green. So the eGFP isn't expressed.

If the eGFP isn't in the same reading frame as the receptor, then when the stop is removed, the receptor-eGFP would be a fusion protein, but if the frame is wrong, the eGFP wouldn't be correctly translated. So the Western blot would show a larger protein (receptor + eGFP), but in reality, maybe it's just the receptor without eGFP. Or the eGFP might not be produced.

Wait, but the Western blot in the question was done in primary astrocytes after transfection. So perhaps in that case, the stop wasn't removed, so the mCherry and eGFP weren't expressed. But the question says the Western blot uses antibodies against the overexpressed proteins, so if the stop cassettes are present, the ligand and receptor would be expressed as separate proteins. The antibodies would detect them, but the fluorescent tags wouldn't be present.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's try to recap.

In the construct:

- Ligand is first, then a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, then the receptor, then a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette, then eGFP.

When Cre is present:

- LoxP sites are recognized and the stop is removed, so ligand is expressed as ligand-mCherry.

- Lox2272 sites are recognized and the stop is removed, so receptor is expressed as receptor-eGFP.

So in the mouse, the Cre should excise both stops, allowing both ligand and receptor to be expressed with their tags.

But in the experiment, after the mouse is born, they don't see green. So eGFP isn't expressed.

Possible issues:

1. Cre isn't active: but the mouse is crossed with SOX10-Cre, which should be active in neural crest.

2. The IRES isn't working, so receptor isn't expressed.

3. The lox2272 sites aren't recognized by Cre, so the stop isn't excised.

Wait, lox2272 is a modified lox site recognized by Cre, but perhaps the strain is using a different variant? Or maybe the Cre isn't able to recognize it, so only the loxP sites are excised.

Wait, the ligand's stop is in loxP, and the receptor's in lox2272. So if the Cre can only recognize loxP, then the ligand's stop is removed, but the receptor's isn't. So ligand-mCherry would be expressed, but receptor-eGFP wouldn't.

But in this case, the ligand's expression would be seen as mCherry in red. But the question says they don't see green, not red either.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the eGFP is not in frame. Let me think about the vector's structure.

The ORF for the receptor is followed by a stop cassette, then eGFP. So when Cre excises the stop, the receptor is immediately followed by eGFP in the same reading frame. If the reading frame is mismatched, the eGFP won't be expressed as a proper protein, leading to no fluorescence.

So if the stop cassette after the receptor was not in the correct reading frame, then upon excision, the eGFP would be in a different frame, making it not functional. Alternatively, the eGFP might not be expressed at all.

So, if the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, then when Cre excises the stop, the eGFP isn't correctly translated. Thus, no green signal.

Which brings us to option D, which states that the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't working properly, so the receptor isn't being expressed. But the IRES is upstream of the receptor, so without the IRES, the receptor wouldn't be translated. But in the vector, the IRES is after the ligand's ORF, which is correct for bicistronic expression.

Wait, another thought: in the vector, the ligand and receptor are co-expressed from the same mRNA. The ligand is first, then the IRES, then the receptor. The stop cassettes are after each. So when Cre is present, the stops are removed, allowing the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP to be expressed.

But perhaps the IRES isn't working, so the receptor isn't expressed. But if that's the case, in the mouse, the receptor wouldn't be expressed, so the eGFP wouldn't be either. But the Western blot in the initial test would have shown the presence of the proteins. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, the issue could be that the eGFP isn't being correctly processed for some reason, like the construct having a premature stop codon or incorrect frame, leading to no fluorescence.

So, putting it all together, the most likely reason is that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, leading to no eGFP expression. So the answer would be D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector expressing a ligand and receptor, with fluorescent tags (mCherry and eGFP) flanking stop cassettes (loxP and lox2272). The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES element. Upon Cre recombination, the stop cassettes are excised, allowing the ligand to be expressed as ligand-mCherry and the receptor as receptor-eGFP. The mouse model was crossed with SOX10-Cre to activate Cre in neural crest-derived cells, but no green signal (eGFP) was observed under the confocal microscope.

### Key Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   This is unlikely because the construct is designed for co-expression of the ligand and receptor in the same cell. The absence of fluorescence in all cells suggests a problem with expression or processing, not a paracrine relationship.

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   While improper protein trafficking could prevent surface expression of eGFP, the Western blot uses total proteins, which would still detect the receptor-eGFP complex. The absence of fluorescence alone does not confirm this issue.

3. **Option C: The enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The CBA promoter is a strong constitutive promoter, and the IRES element ensures translation of the receptor. The construct does not rely on tissue-specific enhancers, making this explanation unlikely.

4. **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame**  
   If the receptor and eGFP are not in the same reading frame, Cre excision of the lox2272 stop cassette would not result in proper translation of eGFP. This would explain the absence of fluorescence while still allowing the receptor to be detected on the Western blot. This is the most plausible explanation.

### Conclusion:
The most likely reason for the absence of the green signal is that the receptor and eGFP are not in the correct reading frame, preventing proper expression of eGFP.
