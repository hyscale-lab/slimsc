Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about determining which molecule has C3H symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry concepts, but let me think this through.

First, I remember that C3H symmetry means the molecule has a three-fold axis of rotation along with a plane of symmetry that bisects this axis. So it's like combining a 120-degree rotation (C3) with a mirror plane (σ) that includes the axis. Wait, or is it that the overall symmetry includes both a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane? No, I think C3H actually refers to a combination where a three-fold rotation is followed by a horizontal mirror reflection, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's better to check each molecule's structure.

The options are:
A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone
B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone
C) triisopropyl borate
D) quinuclidine

I remember that triphenylene is a molecule with a three-fold symmetry. Wait, triphenylene is a tricyclic compound where three benzene rings are connected in a symmetrical way. So maybe option A is a triphenylene derivative. But I'm not sure about their substituents.

Triisopropyl borate is (B(O(i-Pr)3). Its structure is a central boron atom attached to three isopropyl groups. So it's a trigonal planar molecule around boron. But wait, does that mean it has C3 symmetry? Well, the groups are all the same, so a rotation of 120 degrees would map the molecule onto itself. But does it have a plane of symmetry that includes the rotation axis? Triisopropyl borate has three identical substituents, so it should have a C3 axis. But without a mirror plane, would that make it C3 or just C3? The question is about C3H, which includes a horizontal mirror plane, I think.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the notation. C3H would have a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. So it's a combination of rotation and reflection. Alternatively, maybe it's a molecule that has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane, leading to each part mirroring across that plane.

Let me think about each option:

Option C: Triisopropyl borate. The structure is B with three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl is a CH(CH3)2 group. Since all three are identical, rotating 120 degrees would make them overlap. But wait, is there a plane of symmetry? If the molecule is planar, perhaps. But I think triisopropyl borate is a flat molecule. Hmm, maybe it has C3 symmetry but not C3H. Because C3H would require a mirror plane that includes the rotation axis.

Wait, maybe C3H symmetry is the same as the molecule having a three-fold axis and a mirror plane perpendicular to it? Or maybe the mirror plane is horizontal relative to the rotation axis. I'm getting a bit confused on the exact definition.

Let me think about the other options.

Option D: Quinuclidine. Its structure is a bicycle[2.2.2]octane system, which has a chair-like structure. Quinuclidine has a C3 axis because it's symmetric with three-fold rotation. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? I think quinuclidine has a plane of symmetry that goes through the central nitrogen and the opposite side. So C3 and a mirror plane. Wait, but I'm not sure if that plane would be horizontal. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a C3 axis and a σh plane, which would make it C3H.

Wait, but I'm not very confident about quinuclidine's symmetry. Another way: Quinuclidine's structure is similar to adamantane but with a central nitrogen. It has a three-fold axis perpendicular to a plane that bisects the molecule. So maybe it has C3H symmetry.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me parse that. So, it's a molecule with three furan rings connected in a certain way. The numbering suggests substituents at specific positions. I'm not so sure about the symmetry here. Furan derivatives can sometimes have multiple planes of symmetry, but without exact structural knowledge, it's tricky.

Option A: triphenyleno[...]trifuran... That sounds like a more complex structure, perhaps with three phenyl groups attached to a furan system. If the phenyl groups are arranged symmetrically, maybe in a trigonal fashion, that could give C3 symmetry.

Wait, triphenylene itself is a molecule with three benzene rings connected in a way that forms a three-fold symmetry. So any derivative that preserves that central symmetry would have C3H. So option A is a triphenylene fused with a trifuran system. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, it could have C3H symmetry.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about each molecule's actual symmetry.

Let me start over.

C3H symmetry implies that the molecule has a three-fold rotational axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) that goes through the axis. So the combination is the same as the point group D3h.

Wait, no, wait. Point groups: C3H is a subgroup of D3h. Or maybe C3H is not a standard notation, but perhaps the question refers to a molecule that has a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the presence of a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So the molecule's symmetry includes both.

Which of the given molecules fits this?

Triisopropyl borate (option C) has three identical substituents. So, it should have a C3 axis. But does it have a mirror plane? Let's imagine the molecule: the boron is at the center, with three isopropyl groups arranged in a trigonal planar fashion. If the isopropyl groups are all the same, then a mirror plane that bisects the angle between any two substituents would exist. So, for each pair of substituents, there is a mirror plane. So, if the molecule has a C3 axis and three mirror planes, each bisecting a pair of substituents, then the overall symmetry is D3h. Wait, but I thought triisopropyl borate is trigonal planar, which is D3h? Or is it just C3v? Wait, trigonal planar is point group D3h, which includes a C3 axis, three C2 axes perpendicular to the C3, and a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, wait. Point group D3h has a C3 axis, three C2 axes (each perpendicular to C3), a horizontal mirror plane, and others. So if a molecule has D3h symmetry, it would have C3H as well.

Triisopropyl borate has a trigonal planar structure. So its point group is D3h. So it has C3H symmetry. So option C would have that.

Quinuclidine, on the other hand, I think has a point group of C3. Because it's a non-planar molecule with a three-fold axis, but perhaps without a mirror plane. Wait, no, quinuclidine is a chiral molecule? Or is it achiral?

Wait, quinuclidine has a central nitrogen, and its structure is symmetrical. Wait, no, I think it's not chiral because there's a plane of symmetry. So for example, the molecule can be superimposed on its mirror image, making it achiral. So if quinuclidine has a C3 axis and a mirror plane, then it would have D3h symmetry, which would mean C3H. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps its point group is C3h, which would fit.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled up. Let me think about each option's structure.

Triisopropyl borate: Definitely D3h symmetry because it's trigonal planar. So that would have C3H symmetry.

Quinuclidine: I think it's a tetrahedral-like structure but with three substituents. Wait, no, quinuclidine's structure is a bicyclic system, so it's more complex. If it has a three-fold axis and a mirror plane, then yes. But I'm not certain.

Now, looking at the other options:

Option B: Benzo...trifuran... I'm not sure, but perhaps it's a more linear structure, maybe with less symmetry.

Option A: Triphenylene fused with trifuran. Triphenylene has a three-fold symmetry, so if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, the molecule would have C3H symmetry.

Wait, but triphenylene itself has D3h symmetry, so any derivative that doesn't break that symmetry would also have it. So option A, if it's a triphenylene derivative, would have D3h symmetry, which includes C3H.

So now I'm confused between options A and C.

Wait, the question is which of the following has C3H symmetry. If triisopropyl borate (option C) is D3h, then yes, it has C3H. Similarly, if triphenyleno... (option A) is D3h, then it also has C3H.

But the answer can only be one option. So how do I decide between them?

Wait, looking at the options again, the options are labeled A, B, C, D. The question says which molecule has C3H symmetry.

So perhaps I need to figure out which of these structures actually has D3h symmetry.

Triisopropyl borate: Yes, it's trigonal planar, so D3h.

Triphenylene derivatives: Triphenylene itself has D3h symmetry. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, then the derivative would have the same symmetry.

So both options A and C might have D3h symmetry. But wait, the question gives the options as A, B, C, D, and each is a different molecule.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps one of them lacks a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, wait. Another thought: Triisopropyl borate is a planar molecule, so it has a horizontal mirror plane (the plane of the paper, so to speak). So yes, D3h.

Triphenylene is also a planar molecule, so any derivative that preserves the symmetry would have the same.

So both would have C3H symmetry. But that can't be the case because the question asks which of the following has it, implying only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the other options don't have C3H. So I need to think about each.

Option D: Quinuclidine. Its structure is a bicyclic molecule with a central nitrogen. I think it has a three-fold axis but does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Let me visualize it. Quinuclidine is a chair-like structure with the nitrogen at the top. If I imagine a mirror plane cutting through the middle, perhaps it would reflect the structure onto itself. So yes, it would have a mirror plane. So perhaps it has C3H symmetry as well.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Quinuclidine's structure may not be planar. So if it's non-planar, it might not have a horizontal mirror plane. Alternatively, if the molecule is symmetrical enough, it could have a mirror plane.

Alternatively, perhaps quinuclidine's point group is C3h, which includes a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So that's C3H as per the question.

But I'm getting stuck because multiple options could potentially have C3H symmetry.

Wait, the question says which of the following has c3h symmetry. Maybe I should look for another angle.

C3H is a molecule with a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror. So, for example, molecules like benzene (which is D6h) have higher symmetry, but something like ammonia has C3v symmetry but lacks the horizontal mirror.

Wait, but in the given options, I think triisopropyl borate is the most straightforward with D3h symmetry, which includes C3H.

Alternatively, let me think about the other options.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.

Breaking this down: it's a benzo-fused trifuran system with ketone groups.

The benzo is fused to a trifuran in a certain way. The numbering suggests that the substitution is symmetric. But without seeing the structure, it's hard to tell. But I'm not sure if this would have three-fold symmetry.

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran... So the triphenylene is fused with a trifuran. Since triphenylene has three-fold symmetry, and the trifuran is attached in a way that doesn't break that symmetry, the whole molecule would have D3h symmetry. So yes, C3H.

But then both options A and C (and perhaps D) could have it, which can't be.

Wait, perhaps the question is about whether the molecule has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So, for example, triisopropyl borate is planar, so the horizontal mirror plane is present.

Quinuclidine: if it's non-planar, perhaps it doesn't have a horizontal mirror plane. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing the notation. Maybe C3H refers to a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, another approach: Think of each molecule's typical symmetry.

Triisopropyl borate: D3h symmetry.

Quinuclidine: I think it has a three-fold axis but perhaps lacks a mirror plane.

Triphenyleno[...]trifuran: D3h.

Benzo[...]trifuran: Maybe lower symmetry.

So if the question is looking for a molecule with C3H (D3h), both A and C would fit. But the options only allow one correct answer. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structures.

Wait, maybe the triphenyleno compound is not planar. Because it's fused with a trifuran, which is a cyclic ether. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the triphenyleno compound doesn't have a plane of symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps only one of the options has both the C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, let's think about the structures:

Triisopropyl borate is planar, definitely has both.

Quinuclidine: If it's like a bicycle, perhaps it's not planar, so no horizontal mirror plane.

So the correct options would be either A and C.

But looking at the options, the problem gives four choices, so I have to pick one.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps triisopropyl borate is the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Another approach: think about real examples.

I recall that triisopropyl borane (same as triisopropyl borate without the ester groups) is planar and has D3h symmetry. So it should have a C3H symmetry.

Quinuclidine is a well-known molecule. Its structure is a bicyclic system, but I think it's not planar. So perhaps it has a three-fold axis but no horizontal mirror plane, leading to C3v symmetry, not C3H.

Wait, but I'm not sure about whether quinuclidine has a mirror plane. Let me think: if the molecule has a plane of symmetry that lies perpendicular to the three-fold axis, that would be a vertical mirror plane. For C3H, the mirror plane is horizontal (perpendicular to the C3 axis). So in quinuclidine, does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

If the molecule is symmetrical such that flipping it over a horizontal plane leaves it unchanged, then yes. Otherwise, no.

Alternatively, perhaps quinuclidine is C3v. So its symmetry includes a three-fold axis and vertical mirror planes but not a horizontal one. So it wouldn't have a horizontal mirror plane, thus not C3H.

If that's the case, then triisopropyl borate (option C) would have C3H.

Another angle: The correct answer is option A, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps it's option D.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about each option briefly.

Option C: Triisopropyl borate. Structure is trigonal planar, so yes, D3h symmetry. So C3H is present.

So the correct answer is C.

Wait, but the question lists option C as triisopropyl borate. So the answer would be C.

Wait, but I thought the options were A, B, C, D. Let me recheck the question.

Question Options:
A) triphenyleno[...]
B) benzo[...]
C) triisopropyl borate
D) quinuclidine

So if triisopropyl borate is D3h, which has C3H, then option C is correct.

So the answer is option C.

To determine which molecule has **C₃H symmetry**, we analyze the given options. **C₃H symmetry** refers to a molecule that has a three-fold rotational axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) that bisects the axis. This symmetry corresponds to the point group **D₃h**.

### Analysis of Each Option:

1. **Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**  
   Triphenylene itself is a molecule with **D₃h symmetry**, as it has three benzene rings arranged symmetrically around a three-fold axis. If the trifuran substituents are attached in a way that preserves this symmetry, the entire molecule would retain **D₃h symmetry** and thus **C₃H symmetry**. However, without explicit structural details, it is unclear if the trifuran substituents disrupt the symmetry.

2. **Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**  
   This molecule is a benzo-fused trifuran system. The arrangement of the substituents and the fused rings does not clearly suggest a three-fold rotational axis or a horizontal mirror plane. It is unlikely to have **C₃H symmetry**.

3. **Option C: Triisopropyl borate**  
   Triisopropyl borate is a trigonal planar molecule with a central boron atom surrounded by three identical isopropyl groups. It has a **C₃ axis** due to the 120° rotational symmetry and a **horizontal mirror plane** (σh) that bisects the molecule. This gives it **D₃h symmetry**, which includes **C₃H symmetry**.

4. **Option D: Quinuclidine**  
   Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule with a central nitrogen atom. While it has a three-fold rotational axis (C₃), it lacks a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Its symmetry corresponds to **C₃v**, not **C₃H**.

### Conclusion:
Among the given options, **triisopropyl borate (Option C)** is the only molecule that clearly has **C₃H symmetry**. It is planar, has a three-fold rotational axis, and a horizontal mirror plane, making it the correct answer.

Answer: C

Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about determining which molecule has C3H symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry concepts, but let me think this through.

C) triisopropyl borate
D) quinuclidine

I remember that triphenylene is a molecule with a three-fold symmetry. Wait, triphenylene is a tricyclic compound where three benzene rings are connected in a symmetrical way. So maybe option A is a triphenylene derivative. But I'm not sure about their substituents.

Triisopropyl borate is (B(O(i-Pr)3). Its structure is a central boron atom attached to three isopropyl groups. So it's a trigonal planar molecule around boron.

Wait, but I'm not very confident about quinuclidine's symmetry. Another way: Quinuclidine's structure is similar to adamantane but with a central nitrogen. It has a three-fold axis perpendicular to a plane that bisects the molecule. So maybe it has C3H symmetry.

So option A is a triphenylene fused with a trifuran system. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, it could have C3H symmetry.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about each molecule's actual symmetry.

Let me start over.

C3H symmetry implies that the molecule has a three-fold rotational axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) that goes through the axis. So the combination is the same as the point group D3h.

Wait, no, wait. Point groups: C3H is a subgroup of D3h. Or maybe C3H is not a standard notation, but perhaps the question refers to a molecule that has a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the presence of a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So the molecule's symmetry includes both.

Which of the given molecules fits this?

Triisopropyl borate (option C) has three identical substituents. So, it should have a C3 axis. But does it have a mirror plane? Let's imagine the molecule: the boron is at the center, with three isopropyl groups arranged in a trigonal planar fashion. If the isopropyl groups are all the same, then a mirror plane that bisects the angle between any two substituents would exist. So, for each pair of substituents, there is a mirror plane. So, if the molecule has a C3 axis and three mirror planes, each bisecting a pair of substituents, then the overall symmetry is D3h. Wait, but I thought triisopropyl borate is trigonal planar, which is D3h? Or is it just C3v? Wait, trigonal planar is point group D3h, which includes a C3 axis, three C2 axes perpendicular to the C3, and a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, wait. Point group D3h has a C3 axis, three C2 axes (each perpendicular to C3), a horizontal mirror plane, and others. So if a molecule has D3h symmetry, it would have C3H as well.

Triisopropyl borate has a trigonal planar structure. So its point group is D3h. So it has C3H symmetry. So option C would have that.

Quinuclidine, on the other hand, I think has a point group of C3. Because it's a non-planar molecule with a three-fold axis, but perhaps without a mirror plane. Wait, no, quinuclidine is a chiral molecule? Or is it achiral?

Wait, quinuclidine has a central nitrogen, and its structure is symmetrical. Wait, no, I think it's not chiral because there's a plane of symmetry. So for example, the molecule can be superimposed on its mirror image, making it achiral. So if quinuclidine has a C3 axis and a mirror plane, then it would have D3h symmetry, which would mean C3H. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps its point group is C3h, which would fit.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled up. Let me think about each option's structure.

Triisopropyl borate: Definitely D3h symmetry because it's trigonal planar. So that would have C3H symmetry.

Quinuclidine: I think it's a tetrahedral-like structure but with three substituents. Wait, no, quinuclidine's structure is a bicyclic system, so it's more complex. If it has a three-fold axis and a mirror plane, then yes. But I'm not certain.

Now, looking at the other options:

Option B: Benzo...trifuran... I'm not sure, but perhaps it's a more linear structure, maybe with less symmetry.

Option A: Triphenylene fused with trifuran. Triphenylene has a three-fold symmetry, so if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, the molecule would have C3H symmetry.

Wait, but triphenylene itself has D3h symmetry, so any derivative that doesn't break that symmetry would also have it. So option A, if it's a triphenylene derivative, would have D3h symmetry, which includes C3H.

So now I'm confused between options A and C.

Wait, the question is which of the following has C3H symmetry. If triisopropyl borate (option C) is D3h, then yes, it has C3H. Similarly, if triphenyleno... (option A) is D3h, then it also has C3H.

But the answer can only be one option. So how do I decide between them?

Wait, looking at the options again, the options are labeled A, B, C, D. The question says which molecule has C3H symmetry.

So perhaps I need to figure out which of these structures actually has D3h symmetry.

Triisopropyl borate: Yes, it's trigonal planar, so D3h.

Triphenylene derivatives: Triphenylene itself has D3h symmetry. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, then the derivative would have the same symmetry.

So both options A and C might have D3h symmetry. But wait, the question gives the options as A, B, C, D, and each is a different molecule.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps one of them lacks a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, wait. Another thought: Triisopropyl borate is a planar molecule, so it has a horizontal mirror plane (the plane of the paper, so to speak). So yes, D3h.

Triphenylene is also a planar molecule, so any derivative that preserves the symmetry would have the same.

So both would have C3H symmetry. But that can't be the case because the question asks which of the following has it, implying only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the other options don't have C3H. So I need to think about each.

Option D: Quinuclidine. Its structure is a bicyclic molecule with a central nitrogen. I think it has a three-fold axis but does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Let me visualize it. Quinuclidine is a chair-like structure with the nitrogen at the top. If I imagine a mirror plane cutting through the middle, perhaps it would reflect the structure onto itself. So yes, it would have a mirror plane. So perhaps it has C3H symmetry as well.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Quinuclidine's structure may not be planar. So if it's non-planar, it might not have a horizontal mirror plane. Alternatively, if the molecule is symmetrical enough, it could have a mirror plane.

Alternatively, perhaps quinuclidine's point group is C3h, which includes a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So that's C3H as per the question.

But I'm getting stuck because multiple options could potentially have C3H symmetry.

Wait, the question says which of the following has c3h symmetry. Maybe I should look for another angle.

C3H is a molecule with a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror. So, for example, molecules like benzene (which is D6h) have higher symmetry, but something like ammonia has C3v symmetry but lacks the horizontal mirror.

Wait, but in the given options, I think triisopropyl borate is the most straightforward with D3h symmetry, which includes C3H.

Alternatively, let me think about the other options.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.

Breaking this down: it's a benzo-fused trifuran system with ketone groups.

The benzo is fused to a trifuran in a certain way. The numbering suggests that the substitution is symmetric. But without seeing the structure, it's hard to tell. But I'm not sure if this would have three-fold symmetry.

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran... So the triphenylene is fused with a trifuran. Since triphenylene has three-fold symmetry, and the trifuran is attached in a way that doesn't break that symmetry, the whole molecule would have D3h symmetry. So yes, C3H.

But then both options A and C (and perhaps D) could have it, which can't be.

Wait, perhaps the question is about whether the molecule has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So, for example, triisopropyl borate is planar, so the horizontal mirror plane is present.

Quinuclidine: if it's non-planar, perhaps it doesn't have a horizontal mirror plane. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing the notation. Maybe C3H refers to a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, another approach: Think of each molecule's typical symmetry.

Triisopropyl borate: D3h symmetry.

Quinuclidine: I think it has a three-fold axis but perhaps lacks a mirror plane.

Triphenyleno[...]trifuran: D3h.

Benzo[...]trifuran: Maybe lower symmetry.

So if the question is looking for a molecule with C3H (D3h), both A and C would fit. But the options only allow one correct answer. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structures.

Wait, maybe the triphenyleno compound is not planar. Because it's fused with a trifuran, which is a cyclic ether. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the triphenyleno compound doesn't have a plane of symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps only one of the options has both the C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, let's think about the structures:

Triisopropyl borate is planar, definitely has both.

Quinuclidine: If it's like a bicycle, perhaps it's not planar, so no horizontal mirror plane.

So the correct options would be either A and C.

But looking at the options, the problem gives four choices, so I have to pick one.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps triisopropyl borate is the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Another approach: think about real examples.

I recall that triisopropyl borane (same as triisopropyl borate without the ester groups) is planar and has D3h symmetry. So it should have a C3H symmetry.

Quinuclidine is a well-known molecule. Its structure is a bicyclic system, but I think it's not planar. So perhaps it has a three-fold axis but no horizontal mirror plane, leading to C3v symmetry, not C3H.

Wait, but I'm not sure about whether quinuclidine has a mirror plane. Let me think: if the molecule has a plane of symmetry that lies perpendicular to the three-fold axis, that would be a vertical mirror plane. For C3H, the mirror plane is horizontal (perpendicular to the C3 axis). So in quinuclidine, does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

If the molecule is symmetrical such that flipping it over a horizontal plane leaves it unchanged, then yes. Otherwise, no.

Alternatively, perhaps quinuclidine is C3v. So its symmetry includes a three-fold axis and vertical mirror planes but not a horizontal one. So it wouldn't have a horizontal mirror plane, thus not C3H.

If that's the case, then triisopropyl borate (option C) would have C3H.

Another angle: The correct answer is option A, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps it's option D.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about each option briefly.

Option C: Triisopropyl borate. Structure is trigonal planar, so yes, D3h symmetry. So C3H is present.

So the correct answer is C.

Wait, but the question lists option C as triisopropyl borate. So the answer would be C.

Wait, but I thought the options were A, B, C, D. Let me recheck the question.

Question Options:
A) triphenyleno[...]
B) benzo[...]
C) triisopropyl borate
D) quinuclidine

So if triisopropyl borate is D3h, which has C3H, then option C is correct.

So the answer is option C.


To determine which molecule has **C₃H symmetry**, we analyze the given options. **C₃H symmetry** refers to a molecule that has a three-fold rotational axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) that bisects the axis. This symmetry corresponds to the point group **D₃h**.

### Analysis of Each Option:

1. **Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**  
   Triphenylene itself is a molecule with **D₃h symmetry**, as it has three benzene rings arranged symmetrically around a three-fold axis. If the trifuran substituents are attached in a way that preserves this symmetry, the entire molecule would retain **D₃h symmetry** and thus **C₃H symmetry**. However, without explicit structural details, it is unclear if the trifuran substituents disrupt the symmetry.

2. **Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**  
   This molecule is a benzo-fused trifuran system. The arrangement of the substituents and the fused rings does not clearly suggest a three-fold rotational axis or a horizontal mirror plane. It is unlikely to have **C₃H symmetry**.

3. **Option C: Triisopropyl borate**  
   Triisopropyl borate is a trigonal planar molecule with a central boron atom surrounded by three identical isopropyl groups. It has a **C₃ axis** due to the 120° rotational symmetry and a **horizontal mirror plane** (σh) that bisects the molecule. This gives it **D₃h symmetry**, which includes **C₃H symmetry**.

4. **Option D: Quinuclidine**  
   Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule with a central nitrogen atom. While it has a three-fold rotational axis (C₃), it lacks a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Its symmetry corresponds to **C₃v**, not **C₃H**.

### Conclusion:
Among the given options, **triisopropyl borate (Option C)** is the only molecule that clearly has **C₃H symmetry**. It is planar, has a three-fold rotational axis, and a horizontal mirror plane, making it the correct answer.
