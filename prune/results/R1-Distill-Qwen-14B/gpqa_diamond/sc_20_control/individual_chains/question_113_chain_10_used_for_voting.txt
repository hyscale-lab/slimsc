Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice chemistry question in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on some spectroscopic data. The options are four different chemical formulas, all with six carbons and varying numbers of hydrogens and oxygens. The techniques used are FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Let me break down each of these.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks around there are usually O-H stretches. So maybe the compound has an -OH group, like an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, another thing I've heard is that a broad peak can also be from an amine, but I don't think that's the case here because the mass spec might give a hint. Anyway, moving on. There are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. The 1700 is a strong peak, which I think is a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or ester or something like that. The 1650 could be another carbonyl, perhaps conjugated or maybe an aromatic ring. Or maybe it's an absorption from something else, like an aromatic ring's stretching? Wait, if there's a conjugated system, like a carbonyl next to a double bond, that might lower the wavenumber a bit. Like in a ketone with an adjacent double bond, maybe. Or perhaps it's an ester or a conjugated carbonyl.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound has a double bond somewhere. That makes me think maybe the molecule has an alkene group, which would also explain some of the IR data. Oh wait, the 1650 cm^-1 could be a C=C stretching. So maybe it's a conjugated system where a carbonyl is next to a double bond. That would cause both the 1700 and 1650 peaks.

So putting the IR together: a broad peak at 3000 (maybe an -OH), a strong peak at 1700 (probably a carbonyl), and another at 1650 (maybe another carbonyl or a C=C). But wait, sometimes the carbonyl in an ester is around 1730-1750, while a ketone is around 1700. So 1700 might be a ketone or an ester? Or maybe a conjugated carbonyl? Hmm.

Looking at the mass spectrum, there's a fragment peak at m/z 45. I need to think about what fragment would give that. Let's recall some common fragments. For example, the tropylium ion (C7H7+) is around m/z 91, but that's not relevant here. Alternatively, the fragment at 45 could be a small group. Let me think, 45 is 9*5, but in terms of molecular weight, 45 is C3H7O? Wait, wait. Wait, let's break down the possible options.

The options are:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

So their molecular formulas are different. Let's calculate their molecular weights:

A: C6H12O2: 6*12=72, 12*1=12, 2*16=32. Total 72+12+32=116 g/mol.

B: C6H10O: 72 +10 +16=98.

C: C6H10O2: 72 +10 +32=114.

D: C6H12O:72+12+16=100.

But wait, the mass spec shows a fragment at 45. So what fragments would have a mass of 45?

Let me think about possible fragments. 45 could be (CH3)2CO+ (acetone ion), which is (45). Or maybe another group. Alternatively, maybe a loss of a larger group, but what gives m/z 45.

Alternatively, another possibility is the loss of (CH3)2CO, but that's 58. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from an ethyl group or something. Wait, wait – another approach: if the molecular formula is one of the options, maybe the fragment comes from the molecular ion losing some parts. For example, in a molecule with an ester group, maybe the ester breaks into an acid and an alcohol. Or perhaps the molecule has an -OCH2CH3 group, which would have a molecular weight of 45 (since O is 16, CH2CH3 is 15, so 16+15=31. Wait no, that's not 45. Alternatively, maybe a propionyl group. Wait, propionyl is CH2CH2CO, which is 58. Hmm.

Wait, wait. Let me think of a fragment that is 45. 45 is (CH3)2CO, which is acetone. Because acetone's molecular formula is C3H6O, which has a molecular weight of 58? No, wait. Acetone is (CH3)2CO, so molecular weight is (3*12) + (6*1) + 16 = 36 +6 +16=58 g/mol. So that can't be it. Hmm.

Wait, another possible fragment is the formaldehyde group. Formaldehyde is CH2O, which is 30. Not 45. Or maybe a loss of something. Let me think about possible cleavage points.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is the (CH3)CO+ group. Wait, (CH3)CO has a molecular weight of 45? Let's compute: C=12, H=1, O=16.

(CH3)CO would be C2H5O. So 2*12=24, 5*1=5, 16=16. 24+5+16=45. Oh, that's right! So (CH3)CO+ is 45. So if the molecule has a ketone group and a methyl group, maybe. So perhaps the fragment comes from a cleavage in the molecule, releasing a (CH3)CO group.

So which of the options could produce that? Let's think.

Looking at the options:

Option A: C6H12O2. That would be a degree of unsaturation: (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, it's (2*6 +2 -12 - 0)/2 = (14-12)/2= 1. So one ring or double bond. But wait, if the compound has a double bond and an oxygen (like an ester), that might fit.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degree of unsaturation: (12+2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=2. So two rings, or two double bonds, or one ring and one double bond. Since NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which are part of a double bond, so at least one double bond.

Option D: C6H12O. Degree of unsaturation: (12 +2 -12)/2= (14-12)/2=1. So either a ring or a double bond.

But the IR shows a C=C stretch, so that's a double bond. So the compound must have a double bond. Looking at the options:

Option B: C6H10O. Degree of unsaturation is (12+2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=2. So maybe a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

So the presence of a double bond is confirmed by the NMR (vinyl H) and the IR (1650 cm^-1, possibly C=C). So the molecule has a double bond.

Now, considering the FTIR:

- Broad peak at 3000: likely -OH (alcohol or carboxylic acid).
- 1700 cm^-1: carbonyl group (maybe ester, ketone, or aldehyde).
- 1650: possibly conjugated to the double bond, perhaps another carbonyl or the C=C itself.

Wait, but if it's a conjugated system, perhaps the carbonyl is adjacent to the double bond. For example, a ketone next to a double bond would have a lower wavenumber than a simple ketone. So maybe it's a cyclohexenone structure? Or an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone.

But wait, what about the presence of two carbonyl peaks? Or is the 1650 due to something else, like an aromatic ring? But I don't think that's likely because the molecular formulas don't have enough carbons for a benzene ring (but wait, C6H10O2 could be a substituted benzene? Like phenol with a substituent. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is a carbonyl group, but that might be a conjugated ester or something. Let me think about what functional groups are possible.

If the compound has both an -OH group and a carbonyl group, perhaps it's a carboxylic acid? But then the FTIR would show a very broad peak, which it does, but carboxylic acids have O-H around 2500-3300, but also a carbonyl around 1700. Also, the presence of a double bond (vinyl H in NMR) would mean the compound has an alkene. So maybe it's an alpha, beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid? But that's a possibility.

Alternatively, maybe it's an ester with an adjacent double bond, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. For example, something like methyl acrylate. The structure would be CH2=CHCOOCH3. But wait, the molecular formula would be C4H6O2. But our options are C6, so maybe a longer chain.

Wait, but the options are all C6. So maybe the compound is something like methyl vinyl ketone, but more carbons.

Alternatively, think of the structure as having a conjugated dienone, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, let me think about the mass spec again. The fragment at 45 is (CH3)CO+, which is 45. So maybe the molecule has a (CH3)CO group attached to something else. So perhaps it's an acetophenone derivative? But that would have a phenyl group, which I don't see in the options' molecular formulas.

Alternatively, if the molecule is (something like) CH2=CH-CO-O-R, where R is an alkyl group. But I'm not sure.

Let me think about the possible structures for each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: 1. So either a ring or a double bond. The IR suggests a double bond (C=C) and a carbonyl. So maybe it's an ester with a double bond. Alternatively, a cyclic ester (lactone) but with a double bond. Wait, but lactones typically have a ring, so maybe that's an option.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation: 2. So could be two double bonds or a ring and a double bond. Since the NMR shows vinyl H, that's a double bond. So another double bond or a ring. Alternatively, maybe a benzene ring, but that would require more oxygen? Hmm, not necessarily. Wait, benzene is three degrees of unsaturation (each double bond is one, and a ring counts as one). So if the formula is C6H10O2, that's 6 carbons, 10 hydrogens, 2 oxygens. If it's a benzene ring (3 degrees), plus an oxygen-containing substituent, like a methoxy group or a hydroxyl. So for example, phenol with a substituent. But the molecular formula would be C6H5(OH)CH2CH2O-something? Not sure.

Wait, another approach: the presence of the two carbonyl peaks in IR. Or perhaps one is a carbonyl and the other is a conjugated double bond.

Wait, another thought: the 1700 cm^-1 is a carbonyl, say an ester (around 1740 usually, but conjugation can lower it to 1700). Then the 1650 could be a C=C stretch. So if the compound is an ester with a double bond, that could fit.

So let's think about the structure as an ester with a double bond. For example, something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3, but that's more than six carbons. Alternatively, maybe a cyclic ester with a double bond.

Alternatively, the structure could be an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3, but again, maybe the formula is correct.

Wait, let me compute for each option, what functional groups they might have.

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible structures could be an ester (RCOOR') with a double bond elsewhere, or a ketone with an ester group. Or maybe a cyclic ester (lactone) without a double bond, but that would require the double bond elsewhere. Alternatively, a diester, but that's less likely.

Option C: C6H10O2. So degrees of unsaturation =2. So perhaps a ring (one) and a double bond (another), or two double bonds.

Wait, perhaps it's a cyclic ketone with a double bond. Like cyclohexenone. But cyclohexenone is C6H10O. So that's option B. But option B is C6H10O, which has one O. The IR has a carbonyl, so that's possible. But wait, the IR also showed a broad peak, which would be an -OH group. So cyclohexenone doesn't have an -OH. Hmm, that might not fit. So perhaps option C has two O's.

So maybe for option C, it's a diester, but that's not common. Alternatively, a cyclic ester, which would be a lactone. But let's see.

Wait, another approach: the presence of both an -OH group (from the broad IR peak) and a carbonyl group. So that would imply a compound with both, like a phenol ester or a carboxylic acid with an ester group. Alternatively, a hemiacetal or something else, but that's less likely.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is an ortho ester, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-substituted benzene, like salicylic acid derivatives. But I'm not sure. Let me think about the molecular formulas again.

The options:

A) C6H12O2: possible functional groups: ester (RCOOR'), or a ketone plus an alcohol, but that might not fit. Or a diol with a ketone. Hmm.

B) C6H10O: maybe a ketone and a double bond. But where's the -OH group? Because the IR shows a broad peak, which is likely -OH.

So perhaps B is not the answer because it only has one O, which could be a ketone and an alcohol? Wait, that's two O's. Wait, no: C6H10O would have only one O. So if the compound has an -OH and a carbonyl, that would require two O's, which would make the formula C6H10O2, which is option C.

So that makes me think option C is the answer because the IR shows both -OH and a carbonyl, implying two oxygen atoms.

So, option C is C6H10O2.

Now, thinking about the NMR: vinyl hydrogens. So a double bond is present, and the structure includes an -OH group and a carbonyl.

Putting it all together, the structure could be something like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester with an -OH group.

Alternatively, let's think of a molecule like methyl vinyl ketone, but with an -OH somewhere. But wait, methyl vinyl ketone is (CH2=CH)COCH3. Its formula is C4H6O. To get to C6H10O2, maybe it's an ester version.

Wait, another idea: perhaps it's a substituted acrylic acid ester. For example, something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2OH. No, that would have more O's. Alternatively, maybe it's a diol ester, but not sure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester with an -OH group. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a diethyl maleate or similar. But I'm not sure.

But the key points are:

- IR: -OH (broad), carbonyl (1700), and C=C (1650).

- NMR: vinyl H.

- Mass spec: fragment at 45, which is (CH3)CO+.

So the fragment suggests the presence of a (CH3)CO group. So maybe the molecule has a (CH3)CO- part.

So considering that, perhaps it's a compound like ethyl acetoacetate. Acetoacetate is (CH3CO)CH2COO-. But wait, that's more carbons. Alternatively, perhaps a smaller molecule.

Wait, ethyl acetoacetate is C5H8O3, but our options are C6.

Alternatively, maybe it's something like methyl acrylate. Which is CH2=CHCOOCH3. That's C4H6O2. Our options are six carbons, so maybe a longer chain.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the compound is a substituted cyclohexene with an ester group. For example, a ring with an ester substituent and a double bond.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a diester with a double bond.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again about the possible options.

The correct option must have both an -OH group and a carbonyl group, as per the IR. The mass spec fragment at 45 suggests a (CH3)CO group is present.

So let's see each option's possible structure:

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible structures: ester with an alcohol, or a cyclic ester (lactone). But without a double bond, but our IR has a C=C. So perhaps it's an ester with a double bond elsewhere.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation=2. So maybe a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds. Let's say a ring and a double bond. So perhaps a cyclohexene with an ester substituent. But then where is the -OH?

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a cyclic ester (lactone) with an -OH group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-substituted benzene ring with an ester and an -OH, but that would require more O's.

Wait, another angle: the molecular formula of each option.

Option A: C6H12O2.

Possible structure: ester. For example, a methyl ester of a carboxylic acid with a double bond elsewhere. So perhaps something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3. But wait, that's longer. Alternatively, but for C6H12O2, perhaps a structure like cyclopentyl acetate? Wait, cyclopentyl group is C5, acetate is O2, so that would make C6H10O2. Hmm, not matching. Alternatively, methyl cyclohexene carboxylate. Let's think: the formula would be C7H10O2, which is not our case. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a diketone with an -OH? No, that seems unlikely.

Wait, back to the mass spec. The fragment at 45 is (CH3)CO+.

So for that fragment to be present, the molecule must have a (CH3)CO group attached to something else.

So, perhaps the molecule is (CH3)CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-X, where X is something, or maybe a cyclic structure.

So, if the molecular formula is C6H10O2, then (CH3)CO (which is 2 carbons, 3 hydrogens, and one O), but let me count.

Wait, (CH3)CO is C2H3O. So the rest would be C4H7O.

Hmm. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is an ester where the acyl group is (CH3)CO-. So, for example, ethyl acetoacetate is (CH3CO)CH2COOEt. But that's C5H8O3, which is not among the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH3)CO-O-R, where R is a vinyl group. But that would be a ketone ester?

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Let me think about the options again.

Option C: C6H10O2.

This could be an ester with a double bond and an -OH group.

Wait, another thought: the IR shows a broad peak at 3000 (O-H), a carbonyl at 1700, and a C=C at 1650. So the structure could have an ester group (O-CO-O) and a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl (alpha,beta-unsaturated ester). Also, a hydroxyl group somewhere else.

But wait, the mass spectrum's fragment suggests a (CH3)CO group. So, perhaps the structure is an ester where the acyl group is a (CH3)CO- group.

So, the molecule would be something like (CH3)CO-O-R, where R has a double bond and a hydroxyl group.

But that would require R to have at least one more O, which it doesn't if R is, say, CH2CH2OH. Wait, no. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH3)CO-O-CH2CH2CH2-OH. Wait, that would require more O's.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let me make a table to consider each option and see which fits all data.

Option A: C6H12O2.

- Degrees of unsaturation=1. So either a ring or a double bond.

- IR: needs -OH, carbonyl, C=C. So double bond would account for one degree, but then where is the ring or the other O? Maybe a cyclic ester (lactone) but then no double bond. Alternatively, a non-ring structure: an ester with a double bond.

However, the O's are two, so it could be an ester (RCOOR') and an -OH, but that would require three O's. Wait, no: RCOOR' has two O's. So if there's an additional -OH group, that would make three O's. So option A has two O's, so that's not possible. So perhaps option A doesn't have both an -OH and a carbonyl group.

Wait, wait, that's a good point. Because the IR shows both a broad O-H (probably -OH) and a carbonyl. So the molecule must have two O-containing groups: one O-H and one carbonyl. So total O's needed: 2. That's exactly what the option C and A have.

Wait, option A: C6H12O2. So two O's. So if the compound has an -OH and a carbonyl, that's 2 O's. So possible.

So the structure could be an ester (which has two O's) and an -OH group. Wait, but wait, an ester has two O's, so if the molecule is an ester plus an -OH, that would need three O's. Because the ester is O-CO-O, so that's two O's. Then the -OH is a third. So the formula would have three O's. But the options only have two. So that's a problem.

Wait, maybe the compound is a hemiacetal or something else. Alternatively, maybe the -OH is part of the same group as the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a ketone with an adjacent alcohol group, like a cyclic hemiacetal. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a geminal diol, but that's not likely.

Wait, going back, perhaps the IR's 1700 cm^-1 is not a carbonyl, but an aromatic ring with conjugated O's, but that's getting complicated.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me re-examine the possible structures.

The compound has two oxygen atoms. So if the structure has an -OH and a carbonyl group, that would account for two O's. So for example, a carboxylic acid would have -COOH, which is two O's. But in that case, the IR would show a broad O-H around 2500-3300, which it does. The carbonyl would be around 1700, which it does. So a carboxylic acid would fit that. However, a carboxylic acid would have a formula like CnH2nO2. So, for six carbons, it would be C6H12O2, which is option A.

But wait, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which indicates a double bond. So if it's a carboxylic acid, where is the double bond? That's the problem.

Alternatively, maybe it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid. For example, something like CH2=CHCOOH. Its formula is C3H4O2. But our options are C6, so maybe a longer chain. For example, CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOH. That's C6H10O2, which would be option C.

Wait, that's possible. So in this case, the structure would have a double bond and a carboxylic acid group. But wait, the IR's 1650 peak would correspond to the C=C in the alpha,beta position. So that makes sense.

So let's think about option C: C6H10O2. If the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOH, then that's a six-carbon alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid. The formula would be C6H10O2.

In this case:

- IR: broad peak at 3000 (the -COOH O-H), 1700 (the carboxylic acid carbonyl), and 1650 (the C=C).

- NMR: shows vinyl H (from the double bond).

- Mass spec: fragment at 45. Would that fit?

Wait, if the molecule is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOH, then during fragmentation, maybe the molecule breaks after the double bond. So for example, the carboxylic acid part (45? Let me calculate. The COOH group is -COOH: molecular weight is 46 (12+16+16 +1=45? Wait, COOH is -C(=O)OH, molecular formula is CHO2. So the mass is 45 (12 +16*2 +1? No, wait. COOH is (COOH) is C2H4O2? No, wait: COOH is -COOH, which is (COOH) is C=O and OH. So the group is -COOH, which is C:1, O:2, H:2. So the mass is 46 (12 + 16*2 + 1*2 = 12 +32 +2=46). Hmm, that's close to 45. But the fragment is at 45, not 46.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is (CH3)CO+ (45) from the structure. So if the molecule has a (CH3)CO group somewhere, that would produce the 45 fragment.

But in the structure I'm thinking of (CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOH), there's no (CH3)CO group. So maybe that's not the case.

Hmm, maybe another structure. What about a cyclic ester with a double bond and an -OH?

Wait, maybe the structure is something like a cyclohexene with an ester substituent and an -OH group. For example, something like:

O
||
O-C-O- (ester group)
|
CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-C=CH2

Wait, no, that's not making much sense. Maybe I'm getting stuck again.

Another approach: Let's think about the molecular formulas and the possible structures that include an -OH and a carbonyl, with a double bond, and a fragment at 45.

Option C: C6H10O2.

If the formula is C6H10O2, and it has an -OH group and a carbonyl group, perhaps it's a substituted acrylic acid. For example, acrylic acid has the formula C3H4O2. So a larger version would have more carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester with a vinyl group.

Wait, let me think of an ester. Esters have the formula RCOOR'. So for option C, C6H10O2.

If R is CH2CH2CH2CH2- and R' is CH2CH2-, wait, but that would require more carbons.

Alternatively, the structure is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2-. No, that's seven carbons. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's a cyclic ester. For example, a gamma-lactone. But a six-carbon lactone would be a cyclic ester with five carbons in the ring plus the ester oxygen. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is methyl vinyl benzoate or similar, but that would require more O's.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a diester, but that's more complicated.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck, so I should try to make an educated guess based on the data.

The key points are:

- IR: -OH (broad), carbonyl (1700), and C=C (1650).

- NMR: vinyl H.

- Mass spec: 45 (probably (CH3)CO+).

So, the molecule must have a (CH3)CO group.

Looking at the options, which option can include a (CH3)CO group?

Option A: C6H12O2. If it's an ester, perhaps it's (CH3)COOR, where R is a four-carbon group. For example, (CH3)COOCH2CH2CH2CH3. That's C6H12O2. So that would fit option A. Then, where's the -OH group? Oh wait, the IR shows an -OH, so the formula must include that. But option A only has two O's, so if it's an ester (two O's), then where's the -OH?

Ah, that's the problem. So the structure would need both an ester group and an -OH group, which would require three O's. But option A has only two. So that's not possible.

So that leaves option C: C6H10O2.

If the structure is (CH3)CO-O-R, where R is something with a double bond and an -OH group. But how would that fit into the molecular formula?

Wait, let me compute:

(CH3)CO-O-R. The (CH3)COO- part is C3H5O2. So R would need to be C3H5O to make the total C6H10O2.

But R is C3H5O? Wait, that would be C3H5O. Let me think: R is C3H5O. So possible structures for R could be CH2CH2CH2O, but that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe R is a vinyl group with an -OH. So R could be CH2CH(OH)CH2. But that would require more O's.

Hmm, maybe I'm not getting anywhere. Let me think about the likely answer.

Given all the data, the presence of a (CH3)CO group (from mass spec), an -OH and a carbonyl (IR), and a double bond (NMR), the most likely option is C) C6H10O2.

Because:

- It has two oxygen atoms, which would allow for an -OH and a carbonyl.

- The degrees of unsaturation are two, allowing for a double bond and another (like a ring or another double bond).

- The mass spec fragment at 45 suggests a (CH3)CO group, which would fit into a structure with an ester or ketone group.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer is C) C6H10O2.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The unknown compound is analyzed using FTIR, ¹H NMR, and mass spectrometry. The FTIR spectrum shows a broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹, indicating the presence of an -OH group, likely from an alcohol or carboxylic acid. Two strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹ suggest the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and possibly a conjugated C=C bond. The ¹H NMR spectrum indicates the presence of vinyl hydrogens, confirming the presence of a double bond. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45, which corresponds to the (CH₃)CO⁺ ion, suggesting the presence of a (CH₃)CO group in the molecule.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A: C₆H₁₂O₂**  
   - Degrees of unsaturation = 1, indicating either a ring or a double bond.  
   - This option has two oxygen atoms, which could accommodate an -OH and a carbonyl group.  
   - However, the presence of a double bond (from the NMR and IR data) would require a second degree of unsaturation, which this option does not provide.  
   - Additionally, the fragment at m/z = 45 does not fit well with this molecular formula.  

2. **Option B: C₆H₁₀O**  
   - Degrees of unsaturation = 2, allowing for a double bond and a ring or another double bond.  
   - This option has only one oxygen atom, which is insufficient to account for both the -OH and carbonyl groups observed in the IR spectrum.  
   - Therefore, this option is inconsistent with the data.  

3. **Option C: C₆H₁₀O₂**  
   - Degrees of unsaturation = 2, allowing for a double bond and another unsaturation (e.g., a ring or another double bond).  
   - This option has two oxygen atoms, which can accommodate both the -OH and carbonyl groups observed in the IR spectrum.  
   - The fragment at m/z = 45 corresponds to the (CH₃)CO⁺ ion, which is consistent with the presence of a (CH₃)CO group in the molecule.  
   - This option aligns well with the spectroscopic data and is the most likely candidate.  

4. **Option D: C₆H₁₂O**  
   - Degrees of unsaturation = 1, indicating either a ring or a double bond.  
   - This option has only one oxygen atom, which is insufficient to account for both the -OH and carbonyl groups observed in the IR spectrum.  
   - Thus, this option is inconsistent with the data.  

### Conclusion:
The compound is most consistent with **Option C: C₆H₁₀O₂**, as it satisfies the spectroscopic data, including the presence of an -OH group, a carbonyl group, a double bond, and the fragment at m/z = 45.
