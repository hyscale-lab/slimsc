Okay, so I've got this question about molecular symmetry and which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry groups, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I need to remember what C3h symmetry means. From what I recall, symmetry groups describe the different ways a molecule can look the same after certain transformations. C3h is part of the point group classification. The 'C' stands for cyclic, and the subscript 3 means the highest order of rotation is 3-fold. The 'h' probably refers to a horizontal mirror plane. So, C3h symmetry implies that the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane that bisects it.

Let me think about each option one by one.

Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-hexaone. Wait, that's a mouthful. So, it's a triphenylene fused with a trifuran system. The numbering suggests multiple rings. Triphenylene is a tricyclic compound, maybe with three benzene rings connected. When you have fused rings, symmetry can come from having identical substituents and a structure that allows for rotation and reflection.

Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-hexaone. Similar structure but maybe with a single benzene ring attached. So, benzo suggests one benzene ring fused with the trifuran part. Benzoquinuclidine maybe? I'm not sure. But I think this structure might have lower symmetry since it's a single benzene ring compared to triphenylene's three rings.

Option C: Triisopropyl borate. Borate usually has a structure where there's a boron atom with three oxygen-containing groups attached. Triisopropyl would mean three isopropyl groups attached to boron. Wait, the molecule would be something like (i-Pr)3BO... but wait, the actual structure is more likely (i-Pr)3B with some substituents. Alternatively, perhaps it's triisopropyl borate which is a trigonal planar molecule. Wait, no, isopropyl groups are not planar. So the molecule might have a three-fold rotational symmetry because each isopropyl is the same and arranged symmetrically around the boron. But would that give C3h symmetry?

Option D: Quinuclidine. I remember quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule, specifically a norbornane derivative. Its structure is a bridge bicyclic system, so it's more like a cube-shaped or a bicyclo structure. Quinuclidine's structure is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, I think. So, does it have any symmetry? I believe it has an inversion center but maybe not a three-fold axis. Wait, does it have any planes of symmetry? Alternatively, perhaps a three-fold axis... Hmm, not sure.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. C3h symmetry would require a three-fold rotational axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So, the molecule should look the same after a 120-degree rotation around that axis and also mirror reflection in that plane.

Looking at triisopropyl borate: since all three substituents are the same (isopropyl groups), the molecule is symmetric in three-fold rotation. So, if you rotate the molecule 120 degrees around the boron atom, it would look the same. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Hmm. The mirror plane would have to cut through the boron and bisect each isopropyl group. Is that possible?

Alternatively, maybe the triisopropyl borate has a higher symmetry. Wait, the molecule is trigonal planar, right? No, wait, is it? Boron in triisopropyl borate is in the center, with three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl is a bulky group. So the molecule would have a trigonal planar geometry, which is three-fold rotational symmetry. Wait, but C3h is a point group with a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, in point group terms, trigonal planar is D3h. Because D3h has a three-fold rotation, a horizontal mirror plane (sigma_h), and other planes. Oh wait, if a molecule is trigonal pyramidal, it's C3v, but trigonal planar would be D3h. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think: In the trigonal planar geometry, the molecule has three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane, perhaps. So maybe triisopropyl borate has D3h symmetry, which would include C3h as a subgroup. Wait, the question is asking which has C3h symmetry, which is a subgroup of D3h. So perhaps triisopropyl borate would have higher symmetry than C3h, but the question is which has C3h.

Alternatively, maybe some molecules have exactly C3h symmetry without higher symmetry. Let me think about each option.

Option D: Quinuclidine. Its structure is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. I think that structure has a certain symmetry but perhaps not three-fold. It has a bridge, and the molecule is symmetric but maybe only with a two-fold axis or something else. Wait, I think quinuclidine actually has a plane of symmetry but not a three-fold axis. Because the molecule is symmetric in a way that flipping it over a plane would leave it the same, but rotation by 120 degrees... I don't think so. So perhaps D doesn't have C3h symmetry.

Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-hexaone. That's a mouthful. So, let me try to visualize it. Benzo fused to a trifuran. Trifuran is a three-ring system, so maybe that's a structure with three rings connected. The benzo part is a benzene ring connected to the trifuran. So, perhaps the molecule has a central ring with substituents. But I'm not sure about the symmetry. If the substituents are arranged in a way that allows three-fold symmetry, maybe. Alternatively, perhaps the benzo part introduces asymmetry, so the molecule doesn't have three-fold symmetry.

Option A: Triphenyleno... So, triphenylene is a three-linked benzene rings, something like a triangular arrangement. Fused with a trifuran, which probably is a three-ring system as well. So, the molecule would have a lot of symmetry. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, perhaps it has a three-fold rotation axis, and a mirror plane. So, maybe this molecule has C3h symmetry.

Wait, but the question is about the point group. Which of these has C3h symmetry? Let me think about each.

Triisopropyl borate: structure is trigonal planar. So, with three identical groups around a central atom. That would be D3h symmetry, which includes C3h. But the question is about which has C3h. So if a molecule has D3h, it does have C3h as a subset.

Alternatively, maybe triphenylene has C3h. Wait, triphenylene itself is a symmetric molecule. Triphenylene's structure is three benzene rings connected in a way that makes it symmetric. So the molecule has a three-fold axis. If it's also symmetric with a mirror plane, then it would have C3h.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about each molecule.

Option C: Triisopropyl borate. The structure is (i-Pr)3BO- something. No, wait, triisopropyl borate would be (i-PrO)3B. So, the boron is at the center with three isopropyl oxygens attached. The molecule is trigonal planar. The geometry is such that it has three identical substituents. So, the symmetry is at least C3. But with the planar arrangement, perhaps it has a horizontal mirror plane, making it C3h.

Wait, but in a trigonal planar molecule, do you have a horizontal mirror plane? Because the molecule is in a plane, the mirror plane would be perpendicular to the plane of the molecule. Wait, no. The horizontal mirror plane would be a plane that cuts through the molecule, like a flat table. So, in a trigonal planar molecule, the mirror plane is the one perpendicular to the rotation axis and bisects the molecule. So, for a trigonal planar molecule, the point group is D3h, which includes C3h. So, triisopropyl borate would have D3h symmetry, which implies it also has C3h.

But the question is which molecule has C3h symmetry. So if a molecule has D3h, it has C3h as a subset. So the correct answer might be option C, triisopropyl borate.

Wait, but is that the case? Because the options are about which has C3h symmetry. Triisopropyl borate has higher symmetry than C3h—so it would have C3h as a part of its symmetry. So the question is, which molecule has at least C3h symmetry. So any of the options with higher symmetry would still fit.

Wait, but perhaps some of these molecules only have C3h and not higher. Let me think again.

Option A: Triphenyleno...trifuran. If this molecule has three-fold rotation and a mirror plane, it would have C3h.

But I'm not exactly sure which of these structures has the symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps triphenyleno... has a three-fold axis but also a plane that would make it higher symmetry, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: think about which of these molecules have three-fold axes.

Triisopropyl borate definitely has a three-fold rotation axis because all three substituents are identical and arranged symmetrically. So, yes, it has a C3 axis. Now, if it also has a horizontal mirror plane (sigma h), then it would have C3h symmetry.

Wait, in a trigonal planar molecule like (i-Pr)3B, the structure is planar, so the mirror planes would be in the plane (sigma_v planes) and a sigma h plane perpendicular to the C3 axis.

Wait, wait. I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me think about the trigonal planar geometry. The molecule has a central atom with three identical groups. The geometry is such that the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis (C3), and three mirror planes (each containing the C3 axis and one substituent, so sigma v planes). Additionally, there's a horizontal mirror plane (sigma h) that's perpendicular to the C3 axis. So the point group is D3h, which includes C3h.

Wait, but D3h is a higher symmetry than C3h. So if a molecule has D3h symmetry, it automatically has C3h as a part of its symmetry. So, triisopropyl borate has D3h symmetry, which includes C3h. Therefore, it would have C3h symmetry.

So, the question is which has C3h symmetry. Triisopropyl borate (option C) has at least C3h symmetry.

But let me look at the other options. Option D is quinuclidine. I'm not sure about its symmetry. Quinuclidine (bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane) has a bridge structure. It has a plane of symmetry, perhaps a sigma plane, but does it have a three-fold rotation axis? I don't think so. It's more likely to have a two-fold axis or maybe a C2 axis.

Option B: Benzo...trifuran. That structure would have a benzene ring attached to a trifuran. So, the benzene is symmetric, but the rest of the structure may not allow three-fold symmetry. The arrangement could be such that the substituents are in positions that don't allow for a three-fold axis. So, maybe it doesn't have C3h symmetry.

Option A: Triphenyleno...trifuran. Triphenylene is a symmetric molecule. If it's fused with trifuran, the entire structure might have a three-fold axis. But if the substituents on the rings are arranged symmetrically, it might have a three-fold axis and a mirror plane. So, it could have C3h symmetry.

But without seeing the exact structure, it's a bit hard to tell. However, triisopropyl borate's structure is clear—trigonal planar, which gives it D3h symmetry, thus including C3h. So, I'm more confident that option C has C3h symmetry.

Wait, but the options are A, B, C, D. So, the answer could be option C.

Alternatively, let me think about the other molecules again. Quinuclidine (option D). If you imagine the norbornane structure, it has a bridge, so it's symmetric across a plane but not with a three-fold axis. So, I think it doesn't have a three-fold rotation axis, so no C3h.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer is option C: triisopropyl borate.

Wait, but wait. The question is about which has C3h symmetry. So, it's possible that triisopropyl borate has D3h, which includes C3h, but perhaps another molecule has exactly C3h and not higher symmetry. So, is there any other option?

Looking again, option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. That's a fused ring system. Maybe the substituents are arranged in a way that allows for a three-fold axis. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a mirror plane but not a three-fold axis.

Alternatively, perhaps triphenyleno...trifuran (option A) has a three-fold axis and a mirror plane, giving it C3h symmetry.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I can look up the structures.

Wait, I can't actually look things up, but I'll try to imagine.

Triphenylene is a tricyclic aromatic compound with three benzene rings connected in a 'triangular' fashion. When it's fused with a trifuran, which is a three-ring system with each ring sharing two adjacent atoms, perhaps the entire molecule has a three-fold axis.

Alternatively, triphenyleno[...]trifuran would have a symmetric arrangement of substituents, leading to C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps triisopropyl borate is the correct answer because it's trigonal planar, so it definitely has C3h.

In that case, the answer would be option C.

But wait, option C is 'triisopropyl borate'. Let me think about its structure. Triisopropyl borate would have the formula (i-PrO)3B. So, the boron is in the center, with three isopropyl groups attached via oxygen. Because all three substituents are identical and arranged symmetrically, the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis, and a horizontal mirror plane. So, it must have C3h symmetry.

Therefore, the correct answer is option C: triisopropyl borate.

To determine which molecule has **C₃h** symmetry, we analyze the given options based on their structures and symmetry properties. **C₃h** symmetry implies the presence of a three-fold rotational axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ) that bisects the molecule. Let us evaluate each option:

### Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone
This molecule consists of a triphenylene core fused with a trifuran system. Triphenylene is a symmetric tricyclic aromatic compound with three benzene rings arranged in a triangular fashion. When fused with a trifuran, the overall structure may retain three-fold rotational symmetry due to the symmetric arrangement of the rings. Additionally, the molecule likely has a horizontal mirror plane, making it a candidate for **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone
This molecule is a benzo-fused trifuran system. The benzo group introduces a single benzene ring fused to the trifuran framework. While the trifuran part may have three-fold rotational symmetry, the attachment of the benzo group likely disrupts the overall symmetry. This makes it less likely to have **C₃h** symmetry compared to triphenylene-based systems.

### Option C: Triisopropyl Borate
Triisopropyl borate is a trigonal planar molecule with a boron atom at the center and three identical isopropyl groups attached. The trigonal planar geometry ensures a three-fold rotational axis (C₃). Additionally, the molecule has a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ), which bisects the molecule. This combination of a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane confirms that triisopropyl borate has **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option D: Quinuclidine
Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule with a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane structure. It has a plane of symmetry but lacks a three-fold rotational axis. Therefore, it does not exhibit **C₃h** symmetry.

### Conclusion
Triisopropyl borate (Option C) has **C₃h** symmetry due to its trigonal planar geometry, which includes a three-fold rotational axis and a horizontal mirror plane. While triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone (Option A) may also have **C₃h** symmetry, triisopropyl borate's structure is more definitive in this regard.

Triisopropyl borate (Option C) has **C₃h** symmetry due to its trigonal planar geometry, which includes a three-fold rotational axis and a horizontal mirror plane. While triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone (Option A) may also have **C₃h** symmetry, triisopropyl borate's structure is more definitive in this regard.

**Answer: C**
