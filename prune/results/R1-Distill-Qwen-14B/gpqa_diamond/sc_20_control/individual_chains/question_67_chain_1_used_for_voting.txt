Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about two electrons in p orbitals, and their angular momentum state. Hmm, I remember that electrons have spin, but the question says to ignore the spin, so maybe we're only looking at their orbital angular momentum here.

The state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, wait. So each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l of 1, because p orbitals have l=1. So l1 is 1 and l2 is 1 for the two electrons.

The total angular momentum quantum numbers are l=2 and m=-1. Oh right, when you couple two angular momenta, you add them. Like, for two particles with l1 and l2, the total l can range from |l1-l2| to l1+l2. So 1 and 1 can give a total l of 0, 1, or 2. In this case, the state is l=2 and m=-1.

The question is asking about the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z to be -ħ each. So L1z is the z-component of the first electron's orbital angular momentum, and similarly for L2z. The eigenvalues for Lz are mℏ. So for each, the eigenvalues can be -1*ℏ, 0, or +1*ℏ.

Wait, but in the coupled state |l1=1, l2=1, l=2, m=-1>, what is the relation between the individual m1 and m2? Because m is the sum of m1 and m2. So m = m1 + m2. In this case, m is -1. So m1 + m2 = -1.

But the question asks for the probability that m1 is -1 and m2 is -1. Because L1z eigenvalue would be m1 * ħ, so if m1 is -1, L1z is -ħ. Same for m2.

So I need to find the probability that in the state |1,1,2,-1>, when resolving into the m1 and m2 basis, both m1 and m2 are -1.

Wait, but the state is expressed in terms of the coupled angular momentum, not the individual m1 and m2. So I think I need to expand this coupled state into the product states of m1 and m2.

I remember that when you have two angular momenta, the coupled states can be written as a sum of the product states of m1 and m2. For example, for two l=1 particles, the state |l=2, m=-1> should be a combination of |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1.

But wait, in this case, l=2 and m=-1. So the state |1,1,2,-1> is a specific combination of the m1 and m2 states where m1 + m2 = -1.

Wait, but how is that state expressed in terms of m1 and m2? Because when you have coupled states, each coupled state is a sum of product states where m1 + m2 = m.

In this case, the coupled state |2, -1> is a linear combination of all |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1. So possible m1 and m2 pairs are (0,-1), (-1,0), (-1,-1) because 0 + (-1) = -1, (-1) + 0 = -1, and (-1) + (-1) = -2. Wait, no, that can't be. Oh wait, 0 + (-1) = -1, (-1) + 0 = -1, and (-1) + (-1) = -2. Wait, but -1 is the m. So m1 + m2 must equal -1. 

Wait, no, m is the total m, which is -1. So m1 + m2 = -1.

So possible pairs where m1 + m2 = -1 are:

m1 = 0, m2 = -1 → sum is -1.

m1 = -1, m2 = 0 → sum is -1.

m1 = 1, m2 = -2 → but wait, m2 can't be -2 because each electron has l=1, so m can be -1, 0, +1. So m2 can't be -2. Similarly, m1 can't be 2. So only the first two cases are possible: m1=0, m2=-1 and m1=-1, m2=0.

So the state |l=2, m=-1> is a linear combination of the |m1=0, m2=-1> and |m1=-1, m2=0> states.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. I thought that for coupled states, each state is built from all possible combinations of m1 and m2 that sum to m. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the coefficients. Maybe I should think in terms of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

Wait, Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are used to express the coupled states in terms of the product states. For two angular momenta j1 and j2, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients tell you how each |j1, m1; j2, m2> state contributes to |J, M>.

In this case, j1 = j2 =1, J=2, M=-1.

The state |J=2, M=-1> is a combination of |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = M = -1.

Possible (m1, m2) pairs are (0,-1), (-1,0), etc., but as I thought earlier, some are not allowed because m cannot be beyond -l to +l. So m1 and m2 can be -1, 0, +1.

So the allowed (m1, m2) pairs for M=-1 are:

(0, -1): since 0 + (-1) = -1.

(-1, 0): same.

But also, (1, -2) is invalid because m2 can't be -2. Similarly, (-2, 1) is invalid. So only the first two possibilities.

Wait, but wait, can m1 be 0 and m2 be -1? Yes, because m2 can be -1. Same for m1=-1 and m2=0.

So the coupled state |2, -1> is expressed as a linear combination of |m1=0, m2=-1> and |m1=-1, m2=0>.

But what are the coefficients? For two spin-1 particles, I think the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are known. Let me try to recall. For J=2, M=2: it's just |1,1>, coefficient 1.

Similarly, for M=1: the state is a combination of |1,0> and |0,1>, but I'm not sure about the exact coefficients. Wait, but for M=-1, it's a combination of |0,-1> and |-1,0>.

Wait, but I'm not exactly remembering the coefficients. Maybe I should think about the orthonormality.

The state |2, -1> can be written as a sum of product states, each with m1 + m2 = -1.

So |2, -1> = a |m1=0, m2=-1> + b |m1=-1, m2=0>.

But what are the values of a and b? Well, because the state is normalized, a² + b² must equal 1. But that's not enough information. I think symmetry might come into play here. Wait, in this case, the state |m1=0, m2=-1> and |m1=-1, m2=0> are symmetric under exchange of the two particles? No, wait, because swapping the two would switch m1 and m2.

Wait, but in this case, since the coefficients a and b may be the same because of some symmetry. Let's think: the state |2, -1> is antisymmetric under exchange? Wait, no, the angular momentum states are symmetric under exchange. Because when you swap two identical particles, their total angular momentum state should be symmetric if they are bosons, but electrons have half-integer spin and are fermions. Wait, but wait, this is about orbital angular momentum, which is part of the angular momentum but not the spin. So perhaps the orbital angular momentum part is symmetric under exchange because electrons are identical particles, and the total wavefunction (which includes spin and spatial parts) must be antisymmetric. But since we're ignoring spin here, the spatial part (including orbital angular momentum) must be symmetric under exchange. Hmm, perhaps that's complicating things. Alternatively, maybe it's better to just find the coefficients using normalization.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's think of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining two l=1 states. For J=2, the states are |2,2>, |2,1>, |2,0>, |2,-1>, |2,-2>.

The |2,-1> state would be a combination of the product states where m1 + m2 = -1.

So possible (m1, m2) pairs are (0, -1) and (-1, 0).

So the state would be |2, -1> = sqrt(1/2) [ |0, -1> + |-1, 0> ] ?

Wait, I think the coefficients might be such that they are equal because of symmetry, but I'm not completely sure. Let me check for normalization. If each term is (1/sqrt(2)), then the sum of squares would be 1/2 + 1/2 =1, which works.

So the state |2, -1> is (1/sqrt(2)) ( |0, -1> + |-1, 0> ).

So if that's correct, then when we make a measurement of m1 and m2, the possible outcomes are (0, -1) and (-1, 0), each with probability 1/2.

But the question is asking for the probability that both m1 and m2 are -1. That is, what's the probability of the outcome (m1=-1, m2=-1).

Looking at the state, the state is a combination of (0,-1) and (-1,0). There's no ( -1, -1) term in the state because that would sum to m = -2, which corresponds to M=-2, but our state is M=-1.

So the coefficient for (m1=-1, m2=-1) is zero in this state. So the probability is zero.

Wait, that makes sense. Because in |2,-1>, the possible m1 and m2 combinations are only those that add up to -1. So (0,-1) and (-1,0). No ( -1, -1) because that sums to -2, which is a different state.

So when you make a measurement of L1z and L2z, you can only get m1=0 and m2=-1, or m1=-1 and m2=0. But you can't get both m1 and m2 as -1 because that would give m = -2, which isn't the case here.

So the probability of both being -1 is zero. Looking at the options, option D is zero.

The problem involves two electrons in a p orbital, with their orbital angular momentum quantum numbers given as $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$. The coupled angular momentum state of the system is specified as $|l_1, l_2, l, m\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\rangle$. Here, $l$ and $m$ represent the total angular momentum quantum number and its $z$-component, respectively. The task is to determine the joint probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$, which corresponds to $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Coupled State Expansion**: The coupled state $|2, -1\rangle$ is expressed as a linear combination of the product states $|m_1, m_2\rangle$ where $m_1 + m_2 = -1$. For two $l=1$ particles, the possible $(m_1, m_2)$ pairs are:
   - $(m_1, m_2) = (0, -1)$
   - $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, 0)$

   The state $|2, -1\rangle$ is thus a normalized combination of these two states:
   \[
   |2, -1\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |0, -1\rangle + |-1, 0\rangle \right).
   \]

2. **Measurement of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$**: The measurement of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ corresponds to measuring $m_1$ and $m_2$, respectively. The question asks for the probability of obtaining $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. However, this outcome is not possible because:
   - The coupled state $|2, -1\rangle$ only includes the product states $(m_1, m_2) = (0, -1)$ and $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, 0)$.
   - There is no $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, -1)$ term in the state $|2, -1\rangle$, as this would correspond to $m = -2$, which is a different coupled state.

3. **Probability Calculation**: Since the $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, -1)$ term is absent in the coupled state $|2, -1\rangle$, the probability of measuring $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$ is **zero**.

### Conclusion:
The joint probability of measuring $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$ is zero because the coupled state $|2, -1\rangle$ does not include the $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, -1)$ configuration.

Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about two electrons in p orbitals, and their angular momentum state. Hmm, I remember that electrons have spin, but the question says to ignore the spin, so maybe we're only looking at their orbital angular momentum here.

The state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, wait. So each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l of 1, because p orbitals have l=1. So l1 is 1 and l2 is 1 for the two electrons.

The total angular momentum quantum numbers are l=2 and m=-1. Oh right, when you couple two angular momenta, you add them. Like, for two particles with l1 and l2, the total l can range from |l1-l2| to l1+l2. So 1 and 1 can give a total l of 0, 1, or 2. In this case, the state is l=2 and m=-1.

The question is asking about the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z to be -ħ each. So L1z is the z-component of the first electron's orbital angular momentum, and similarly for L2z. The eigenvalues for Lz are mℏ. So for each, the eigenvalues can be -1*ℏ, 0, or +1*ℏ.

Wait, but in the coupled state |l1=1, l2=1, l=2, m=-1>, what is the relation between the individual m1 and m2? Because m is the sum of m1 and m2. So m = m1 + m2. In this case, m is -1. So m1 + m2 = -1.

But the question asks for the probability that m1 is -1 and m2 is -1. Because L1z eigenvalue would be m1 * ħ, so if m1 is -1, L1z is -ħ. Same for m2.

So I need to find the probability that in the state |1,1,2,-1>, when resolving into the m1 and m2 basis, both m1 and m2 are -1.

Wait, but the state is expressed in terms of the coupled angular momentum, not the individual m1 and m2. So I think I need to expand this coupled state into the product states of m1 and m2.

I remember that when you have two angular momenta, the coupled states can be written as a sum of the product states of m1 and m2. For example, for two l=1 particles, the state |l=2, m=-1> should be a combination of |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1.

But wait, in this case, l=2 and m=-1. So the state |1,1,2,-1> is a specific combination of the m1 and m2 states where m1 + m2 = -1.

Wait, but how is that state expressed in terms of m1 and m2? Because when you have coupled states, each coupled state is a sum of product states where m1 + m2 = m.

In this case, the coupled state |2, -1> is a linear combination of all |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1. So possible m1 and m2 pairs are (0,-1), (-1,0), (-1,-1) because 0 + (-1) = -1, (-1) + 0 = -1, and (-1) + (-1) = -2. Wait, no, that can't be. Oh wait, 0 + (-1) = -1, (-1) + 0 = -1, and (-1) + (-1) = -2. Wait, but -1 is the m. So m1 + m2 must equal -1. 

Wait, no, m is the total m, which is -1. So m1 + m2 = -1.

So possible pairs where m1 + m2 = -1 are:

m1 = 0, m2 = -1 → sum is -1.

m1 = -1, m2 = 0 → sum is -1.

m1 = 1, m2 = -2 → but wait, m2 can't be -2 because each electron has l=1, so m can be -1, 0, +1. So m2 can't be -2. Similarly, m1 can't be 2. So only the first two cases are possible: m1=0, m2=-1 and m1=-1, m2=0.

So the state |l=2, m=-1> is a linear combination of the |m1=0, m2=-1> and |m1=-1, m2=0> states.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. I thought that for coupled states, each state is built from all possible combinations of m1 and m2 that sum to m. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the coefficients. Maybe I should think in terms of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

Wait, Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are used to express the coupled states in terms of the product states. For two angular momenta j1 and j2, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients tell you how each |j1, m1; j2, m2> state contributes to |J, M>.

In this case, j1 = j2 =1, J=2, M=-1.

The state |J=2, M=-1> is a combination of |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = M = -1.

Possible (m1, m2) pairs are (0,-1), (-1,0), etc., but as I thought earlier, some are not allowed because m cannot be beyond -l to +l. So m1 and m2 can be -1, 0, +1.

So the allowed (m1, m2) pairs for M=-1 are:

(0, -1): since 0 + (-1) = -1.

(-1, 0): same.

But also, (1, -2) is invalid because m2 can't be -2. Similarly, (-2, 1) is invalid. So only the first two possibilities.

Wait, but wait, can m1 be 0 and m2 be -1? Yes, because m2 can be -1. Same for m1=-1 and m2=0.

So the coupled state |2, -1> is expressed as a linear combination of |m1=0, m2=-1> and |m1=-1, m2=0>.

But what are the coefficients? For two spin-1 particles, I think the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are known. Let me try to recall. For J=2, M=2: it's just |1,1>, coefficient 1.

Similarly, for M=1: the state is a combination of |1,0> and |0,1>, but I'm not sure about the exact coefficients. Wait, but for M=-1, it's a combination of |0,-1> and |-1,0>.

Wait, but I'm not exactly remembering the coefficients. Maybe I should think about the orthonormality.

The state |2, -1> can be written as a sum of product states, each with m1 + m2 = -1.

So |2, -1> = a |m1=0, m2=-1> + b |m1=-1, m2=0>.

But what are the values of a and b? Well, because the state is normalized, a² + b² must equal 1. But that's not enough information. I think symmetry might come into play here. Wait, in this case, the state |m1=0, m2=-1> and |m1=-1, m2=0> are symmetric under exchange of the two particles? No, wait, because swapping the two would switch m1 and m2.

Wait, but in this case, since the coefficients a and b may be the same because of some symmetry. Let's think: the state |2, -1> is antisymmetric under exchange? Wait, no, the angular momentum states are symmetric under exchange. Because when you swap two identical particles, their total angular momentum state should be symmetric if they are bosons, but electrons have half-integer spin and are fermions. Wait, but wait, this is about orbital angular momentum, which is part of the angular momentum but not the spin. So perhaps the orbital angular momentum part is symmetric under exchange because electrons are identical particles, and the total wavefunction (which includes spin and spatial parts) must be antisymmetric. But since we're ignoring spin here, the spatial part (including orbital angular momentum) must be symmetric under exchange. Hmm, perhaps that's complicating things. Alternatively, maybe it's better to just find the coefficients using normalization.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's think of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining two l=1 states. For J=2, the states are |2,2>, |2,1>, |2,0>, |2,-1>, |2,-2>.

The |2,-1> state would be a combination of the product states where m1 + m2 = -1.

So possible (m1, m2) pairs are (0, -1) and (-1, 0).

So the state would be |2, -1> = sqrt(1/2) [ |0, -1> + |-1, 0> ] ?

Wait, I think the coefficients might be such that they are equal because of symmetry, but I'm not completely sure. Let me check for normalization. If each term is (1/sqrt(2)), then the sum of squares would be 1/2 + 1/2 =1, which works.

So the state |2, -1> is (1/sqrt(2)) ( |0, -1> + |-1, 0> ).

So if that's correct, then when we make a measurement of m1 and m2, the possible outcomes are (0, -1) and (-1, 0), each with probability 1/2.

But the question is asking for the probability that both m1 and m2 are -1. That is, what's the probability of the outcome (m1=-1, m2=-1).

Looking at the state, the state is a combination of (0,-1) and (-1,0). There's no ( -1, -1) term in the state because that would sum to m = -2, which corresponds to M=-2, but our state is M=-1.

So the coefficient for (m1=-1, m2=-1) is zero in this state. So the probability is zero.

Wait, that makes sense. Because in |2,-1>, the possible m1 and m2 combinations are only those that add up to -1. So (0,-1) and (-1,0). No ( -1, -1) because that sums to -2, which is a different state.

So when you make a measurement of L1z and L2z, you can only get m1=0 and m2=-1, or m1=-1 and m2=0. But you can't get both m1 and m2 as -1 because that would give m = -2, which isn't the case here.

So the probability of both being -1 is zero. Looking at the options, option D is zero.


The problem involves two electrons in a p orbital, with their orbital angular momentum quantum numbers given as $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$. The coupled angular momentum state of the system is specified as $|l_1, l_2, l, m\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\rangle$. Here, $l$ and $m$ represent the total angular momentum quantum number and its $z$-component, respectively. The task is to determine the joint probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$, which corresponds to $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Coupled State Expansion**: The coupled state $|2, -1\rangle$ is expressed as a linear combination of the product states $|m_1, m_2\rangle$ where $m_1 + m_2 = -1$. For two $l=1$ particles, the possible $(m_1, m_2)$ pairs are:
   - $(m_1, m_2) = (0, -1)$
   - $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, 0)$

   The state $|2, -1\rangle$ is thus a normalized combination of these two states:
   \[
   |2, -1\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |0, -1\rangle + |-1, 0\rangle \right).
   \]

2. **Measurement of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$**: The measurement of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ corresponds to measuring $m_1$ and $m_2$, respectively. The question asks for the probability of obtaining $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. However, this outcome is not possible because:
   - The coupled state $|2, -1\rangle$ only includes the product states $(m_1, m_2) = (0, -1)$ and $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, 0)$.
   - There is no $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, -1)$ term in the state $|2, -1\rangle$, as this would correspond to $m = -2$, which is a different coupled state.

3. **Probability Calculation**: Since the $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, -1)$ term is absent in the coupled state $|2, -1\rangle$, the probability of measuring $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$ is **zero**.

### Conclusion:
The joint probability of measuring $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$ is zero because the coupled state $|2, -1\rangle$ does not include the $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, -1)$ configuration.
