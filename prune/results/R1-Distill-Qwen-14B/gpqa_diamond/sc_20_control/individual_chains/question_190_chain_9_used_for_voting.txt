Okay, so I've got this question here about nucleophilicity in aqueous solution. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking me to arrange five nucleophiles from most reactive to least reactive. The options are 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate, hydroxide, propionate, methanol, and ethanethiolate.

Wait, nucleophilicity depends on the solvent, right? The question says aqueous solution, so it's in water. In polar protic solvents like water, the strength of a nucleophile is influenced by how well it's solvated. Strong bases are good nucleophiles, but if they're too bulky, they might not be as reactive because the solvent can't stabilize them as well.

Let me list out the nucleophiles again:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: That's an alkoxide, right? Alkoxides are strong bases. But wait, steric hindrance might affect their nucleophilicity. The 4-methyl group would make the cyclohexan-1-olate a bit bulky. Hmm.

2. Hydroxide (OH-): Also an alkoxide, but smaller. But in water, it's a strong base but maybe not the most nucleophilic because it's solvated a lot. Or wait, in some cases, like in SN2 reactions, it's a good nucleophile.

3. Propionate (CH2CH2COO-): That's the conjugate base of propionic acid. Since it's a weaker base compared to OH- or the thiolate, its nucleophilicity might be lower. Because in polar protic solvents, weaker bases can be better nucleophiles? Wait, no. Stronger bases are better nucleophiles when they're not too bulky or if the solvent allows them to stay reactive.

4. Methanol (CH3OH): That's an alcohol, but not deprotonated. So it's a weaker base than the alkoxides or thiolate. In aqueous solution, it's not a strong nucleophile because it's not a good electron pair donor. Its reactivity would be lower than the other deprotonated ones.

5. Ethanethiolate (CH2CH2S-): Thiolate ions are stronger bases than alkoxides. Because sulfur is larger and less electronegative than oxygen, the thiolate ion is a better nucleophile. In polar protic solvents, thiolate ions are more nucleophilic than hydroxide because they're less solvated. Wait, or is it the opposite? No, wait: in polar aprotic solvents, the order is different. In polar protic, like water, the bigger and less electronegative the atom, the less solvated it is, so it's a better nucleophile.

So, comparing the nucleophiles:

Ethanethiolate (5) is a strong nucleophile because S is less electronegative than O, so it's less tightly held by the solvent. So it's a good nucleophile here.

Hydroxide (2) is an alkoxide, but in water, it's a strong base but may not be as nucleophilic as, say, the thiolate because of solvation. Wait, but I'm a bit confused here. I remember that in aqueous solutions, the order of nucleophilicity for similar ions is: RS- > RO- > HO- > others. Or wait, maybe in water, the order is different because of the solvent's effect.

Wait, let's think about the basicity. Thiolates are stronger bases than alkoxides. So in an SN2 reaction in water, the thiolate would be a better nucleophile than hydroxide because it's a stronger base. So 5 (ethanethiolate) is more reactive than 2 (hydroxide).

Then comes the cyclohexanolate (1). It's an alkoxide, but bulky. So even though it's a strong base, the steric hindrance might reduce its nucleophilicity. So maybe 2 is more reactive than 1, but wait, 2 is hydroxide, which is small, so it's more reactive than 1 because 1 is bulkier.

Wait, wait, so the order so far is 5 (ethanethiolate) > 2 (hydroxide) > 1 (4-methylcyclohexanolate) ?

Wait, but I'm not sure about the cyclohexanolate. If the cyclohexanolate is bulky, like if it has a lot of substituents, that could hinder its attack. So 1 is an alkoxide but maybe less reactive than hydroxide because of bulk. So 2 would be more reactive than 1.

Then comes the propionate (3). Propionate is the conjugate base of propionic acid. Since propionic acid is a weak acid compared to acetic acid, wait, actually, no: the pKa of propionic acid is around 4.88, and acetic acid is around 4.76, so propionic is weaker. Wait, but their conjugate bases would be stronger for the weaker acids. So propionate is a weaker base than acetate. Wait, but wait, our options don't include acetate, so in this case, the propionate is a weaker base than, say, hydroxide or the thiolate. So in aqueous solution, its nucleophilicity would be lower than the others except for methanol.

Methanol (4) is a neutral molecule. It's not deprotonated, so it's a poor nucleophile compared to the others which are all deprotonated ions. So 4 is the least reactive.

So putting it all together: the order from most reactive to least reactive would be:

5 (ethanethiolate) > 2 (hydroxide) > 1 (cyclohexanolate) > 3 (propionate) > 4 (methanol)

Wait, wait. Wait a minute, I'm getting confused here. Let me think again. In aqueous solution, the strength of the base isn't the only factor. Solubility and solvation play a big role.

In polar protic solvents, the nucleophilicity order for similar ions (like O- and S-) is: S- is less solvated than O- because S is larger and less electronegative, so the S- ion is a better nucleophile. So (5) ethanethiolate is more nucleophilic than (2) hydroxide.

Then, among the alkoxides, (1) is a bulky one. So (2) hydroxide is more nucleophilic than (1) because hydroxide is smaller and can attack more easily, whereas (1) is hindered.

Then comes the propionate (3), which is a weaker base than hydroxide and the thiolate. So (3) is less nucleophilic than (2) and (1), but more than methanol.

And methanol (4) is the least reactive because it's not deprotonated.

So the order is: 5 > 2 > 1 > 3 >4.

Wait, the options are arranged from most to least reactive. Let me look at the options.

Options:

A) 5, 2, 3, 1 and 4 → 5 first, then 2, 3, 1, 4. No, that's not what I thought.

B) 2,5,1,4,3 → 2 first, then 5, then 1, then 4, then 3. Hmm, no, I thought 5 is first.

C) 2,5,3,4,3 → Wait, that can't be right. The same number 3 appears twice. Maybe a typo, but probably not.

D)5,2,1,3,4 → Yes, this matches what I thought: 5, then 2, then 1, then 3, then 4.

Wait, but I have to make sure about the order between (1) and (3). Propionate is a conjugate base of a weak acid, so it's a weaker base than hydroxide but stronger than, say, acetate. But in aqueous solution, does the propionate ion have higher nucleophilicity than the cyclohexanolate?

Wait, cyclohexanolate is a strong base but bulky. Propionate is a weaker base but less bulky. In a polar protic solvent, the more polarizable and less solvated species would be more nucleophilic. So, propionate is less basic than hydroxide but more than, say, something like Cl-.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's think about the pKa of the conjugate acids.

The pKa of cyclohexanol is around 16-18. Propionic acid is around 4.88, so propionate has a pKa around 4.88. Wait, wait, no: the pKa of the acid is the same as the conjugate base. Wait, the conjugate base's strength is determined by the acid's strength. Stronger acid → weaker conjugate base.

So, if propionic acid has a pKa of around 4.88, then propionate is a weaker base than hydroxide (pKa of water is ~15.7). So propionate is weaker than hydroxide as a base.

The cyclohexanol's pKa is around 19, so cyclohexanolate is a stronger base than hydroxide. Because it's the conjugate base of a weaker acid.

So in order of base strength: 1 (cyclohexanolate) > 2 (hydroxide) > 5 (ethanethiolate?), wait no—ethanethiol is weaker acid than water? Wait, ethanethiol (HS-) has a pKa around 10. So its conjugate base (ethanethiolate) has a higher pKa (around 10), so it's a weaker base than hydroxide (pKa ~15.7). Wait, no, wait: the pKa of ethanethiol is around 10, so the ethanethiolate ion (S-) is a stronger base than hydroxide (since it's easier to deprotonate a weaker acid). Wait, no, the conjugate base is stronger when the acid is weaker. So for example, if acid A has lower pKa (stronger acid), its conjugate base is weaker. So ethanethiol has pKa ~10, so ethanethiolate is a stronger base than hydroxide (pKa ~15.7). So the order of base strength is: 1 (cyclohexanolate) > 5 (ethanethiolate) > 2 (hydroxide) > 3 (propionate) > 4 (methanol).

But nucleophilicity in polar protic solvents is not just about base strength because strong bases can be poorly nucleophilic if they're too bulky or too solvated.

In polar protic solvents, the less solvated (i.e., larger, less electronegative) ions are better nucleophiles. So, among the same type, the one with larger size and less charge density would have better nucleophilicity.

So ethanethiolate (5), being S-, is a better nucleophile than the hydroxide (2), because S is larger and less electronegative. So 5 is better than 2.

Then comes the cyclohexanolate (1), which is a strong base but bulky. So its nucleophilicity might be less than hydroxide because of the bulk, even though it's a stronger base.

So order so far: 5 > 2 > 1.

Propionate (3) is a weaker base, so it's less nucleophilic than 1, 2, 5. Methanol is the least.

Wait, but earlier I thought 1 was more basic than 2. So in a polar protic solvent, the bulky 1 would be less nucleophilic than 2, which is less bulky. So the order is 5 > 2 > 1 >3 >4.

So looking at the options, which option has 5 first, then 2, then 1, then 3, then 4?

Looking at the options:

Option D) 5, 2, 1, 3,4. So D) is 5,2,1,3,4.

But wait, I thought the order was 5,2,1,3,4.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option D says 5,2,1,3 and 4. Yes, that's correct.

Wait but I'm not 100% confident. Let me think again.

Another approach: the trend in nucleophilicity in polar protic solvents is: the less solvated the nucleophile, the better. So the order is: RS- > RO- > HO- > (others like CH3O- but considering steric effects).

So in this case, ethanethiolate (5) is the best, followed by hydroxide (2). Then comes the cyclohexanolate (1), but it's bulky, so maybe it's less reactive than hydroxide, but more than propionate.

Wait, no, in terms of basicity, 1 is a stronger base than 2. But in terms of nucleophilicity, in polar protic, it's the solvation that matters. So perhaps the order is 5 >2 >1 >3 >4.

Wait, but sometimes the bulky groups can make the nucleophile less effective. For example, tert-butoxide is a strong base but a poor nucleophile in SN2 reactions because of steric hindrance. So in this case, 1 is 4-methylcyclohexanolate; it's not as bulky as t-butoxide but still more bulky than hydroxide.

So perhaps 2 is more nucleophilic than 1.

So the order is 5 >2 >1 >3>4.

Which corresponds to option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the reactivity of nucleophiles in aqueous solution, we consider nucleophilicity trends in polar protic solvents. In such solvents, nucleophilicity is influenced by solvation and steric hindrance. Larger, less electronegative atoms are less solvated and thus better nucleophiles. Additionally, steric hindrance can reduce the reactivity of bulky nucleophiles.

The nucleophiles provided are:

1. **4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate**: A bulky alkoxide, strong base, but hindered by steric effects.  
2. **Hydroxide (OH⁻)**: A small alkoxide, strong base, and not as hindered as the cyclohexanolate.  
3. **Propionate (CH₃CH₂COO⁻)**: A weaker base compared to alkoxides, with moderate nucleophilicity.  
4. **Methanol (CH₃OH)**: A neutral molecule, poor nucleophile as it is not deprotonated.  
5. **Ethanethiolate (CH₃CH₂S⁻)**: A strong nucleophile due to sulfur's larger size and lower electronegativity, making it less solvated than hydroxide.

### Analysis:
- **Ethanethiolate (5)** is the most nucleophilic because sulfur is less electronegative and larger, reducing solvation.  
- **Hydroxide (2)** is next, as it is a small, strong base but more solvated than ethanethiolate.  
- **4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1)** follows, as it is a strong base but hindered by steric bulk.  
- **Propionate (3)** is less nucleophilic due to being a weaker base and less reactive in polar protic solvents.  
- **Methanol (4)** is the least reactive as it is neutral and not deprotonated.

### Correct Order:
5 (ethanethiolate) > 2 (hydroxide) > 1 (4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate) > 3 (propionate) > 4 (methanol).

### Option Matching:
The correct arrangement matches **Option D**: 5, 2, 1, 3, 4.
