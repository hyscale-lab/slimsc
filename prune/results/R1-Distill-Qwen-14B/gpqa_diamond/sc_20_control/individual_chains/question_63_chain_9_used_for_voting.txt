Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about diatomic molecules and their energy states. Hmm. Let me try to break it down.

The question says we have a diatomic molecule made of elements X and Y. They're modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is the non-rigid rotor model. Wait, the non-rigid rotor model considers both rotational and vibrational energy states. Right, because rigid rotor is just rotation and doesn't account for bond vibrations.

The molecule is in its fundamental state. Oh wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, both vibrationally and rotationally. So, the ground state in both aspects. Now, the question is about what momentum a photon should have to make the molecule switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh, so it's about absorbing a photon and transitioning to the next energy level.

Hmm, but what's the next state? The next lowest state would involve the molecule moving to the next higher energy level. In the non-rigid rotor model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states.

Wait, the molecule is currently in its fundamental state, which is the first vibrational level (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (probably the ground rotational state, which is J=0 or J=1? Wait, for a diatomic molecule, the rotational states start at J=0, but in the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. But since this is the non-rigid rotor, maybe the energy levels are a bit different, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering a simple two-level system, like a vibrational transition.

Wait, the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So, the lowest energy transition would be from the ground state to the first excited state. But what is the ground state? If the molecule is at the fundamental vibrational state (v=0), and the lowest rotational state (J=0), then the next possible state could be either increasing the vibrational state (v=1) or increasing the rotational state (J=1). But which transition has lower energy? Because the photon's energy needs to match the energy difference, so which one is smaller.

Wait, the energy differences in rotation and vibration can vary. Vibrational transitions usually have higher energy gaps than rotational. Let me think: the vibrational energy levels are given by E_vib = (v + 1/2) h w, where w is the angular frequency. The rotational energy is E_rot = B J (J+1), with B being the rotational constant. So, the energy difference for a vibrational transition from v=0 to v=1 is h w. For a rotational transition, say from J=0 to J=1, the energy difference is B [1*(1+1) - 0] = 2B.

So which of these is smaller, h w or 2B? Looking at the given data: w is 4e14 rad/s. Let me compute h w. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. So E_vib = h*w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Now, what's B? The rotational constant B is given by (h)/(8 pi² I c), where I is the moment of inertia and c is the speed of light? Wait, no, I think B is (h)/(8 pi² I). Let me get the formula right. The rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), and B is (h)/(8 pi² I). Alternatively, sometimes it's written as B = (ħ²)/(2 I), but I'm not sure. Wait, no. Let me think about the moment of inertia I.

The moment of inertia I for a diatomic molecule is I = μ r^2, where μ is the reduced mass and r is the bond length. The reduced mass μ is (m_x * m_y)/(m_x + m_y). Oh, right, because it's the two atoms rotating around their center of mass.

So, given the masses: Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) ) amu. That's 40 / 22 = approximately 1.818 amu. But I need to convert that into kilograms. 1 amu is about 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ let's compute: 1.818 * 1.6605 is about 3.022. So 3.022e-27 kg.

The bond length r is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so r = 2e-10 m.

So I = μ r² = 3.022e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2. Let's compute that: (2e-10)^2 is 4e-20. So I = 3.022e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2088e-46 kg·m².

Now, B is (h)/(8 pi² I). Let me calculate that. h is 6.626e-34 J·s. So B = 6.626e-34 / (8 * pi² * 1.2088e-46).

Let me compute the denominator first: 8 * pi² ≈ 8 *9.8696 ≈ 78.9568. So denominator is 78.9568 *1.2088e-46 ≈ 78.9568 * 1.2088 is approximately 95.4. So denominator is 95.4e-46 ≈9.54e-45.

So B = 6.626e-34 /9.54e-45. Let's compute that: 6.626e-34 /9.54e-45 = (6.626 /9.54) *1e11 ≈ 0.694 *1e11 = 6.94e10 s^-1.

Wait, that seems too high. Wait, wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, denominator: 8 pi² I. So 8 * pi² is about 78.96. So 78.96 * 1.2088e-46 kg m². 78.96 *1.2088 is approximately 95.4. So 95.4e-46 kg m².

So 8 pi² I =95.4e-46 =9.54e-45.

So B = h/(8 pi² I) = 6.626e-34 /9.54e-45. Let me compute that as (6.626 /9.54) *1e( -34 +45) → (0.694) *1e11 → 6.94e10 s^-1.

Wait, that's a very high frequency. Hmm, but maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Alternatively, perhaps B is (h c)/(8 pi² I), but I'm not sure. Wait, no, the energy levels for rotation are E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is in cm^-1, but when calculating in terms of J, it's just B as the rotational constant in s^-1. Alternatively, maybe I should have used B = ħ²/(2I), but I'm not confident.

Wait, let me think again. The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = (ħ² J (J+1))/(2 I), where ħ is h/(2 pi). So E_rot = (h² J (J+1))/(8 pi² I). So for J=0, E=0. For J=1, E = (h² *2)/(8 pi² I) = h²/(4 pi² I) * (1/2). Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, the rotational constant B is defined as h/(8 pi² I c), where c is the speed of light, but that would be if we're using wavenumbers. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the terms. Let me look up the formula in my notes. Oh wait, in the context of this problem, perhaps I should proceed with the information I have.

Wait, I'm getting B =6.94e10 s^-1. Let's see what the energy difference is for a rotational transition from J=0 to J=1. The energy difference ΔE_rot would be E(J=1) - E(J=0) = B * [1*2 - 0] = 2B. So that's 2 *6.94e10 =1.388e11 J.

Wait, but that's way larger than the vibrational energy difference. Earlier, E_vib was 2.65e-19 J. So the vibrational transition is way lower in energy. So the molecule would absorb a photon with energy hν = E_vib, which is 2.65e-19 J.

But wait, the question isn't about the energy of the photon, it's about the momentum of the photon. Oh right, because the problem asks for the momentum p of the absorbed photon.

Wait, the energy of a photon is E=pc, where p is momentum and c is the speed of light. Because for photons, E=pc (since their mass is zero). So p = E/(c).

So, if the photon's energy is 2.65e-19 J, then p = (2.65e-19 J) / (3e8 m/s) ≈ 8.83e-28 kg·m/s. Wait, but looking at the options, none of them match that.

Wait, the options are:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B) 2.3e-27 Ns

C) 1.1e-27 Ns

D) 1.4e-28 Ns

Wait, 1 Ns is 1 kg·m/s. So our computed p is approximately 8.83e-28 kg·m/s = 8.83e-28 Ns. But looking at the options, the closest is option A: 1.9e-28, but that's much lower.

Hmm, that's a problem. So either I made a mistake in the calculation, or perhaps I'm choosing the wrong transition.

Wait, maybe the next state isn't a vibrational transition but a rotational one, but that would require a higher energy photon. But the question says "next state with the lowest possible energy." So perhaps the lowest energy transition is the vibrational one. But according to our earlier calculation, the rotational transition's energy is way higher than the vibrational, so the photon's energy would be in the infrared or something.

Wait, but the computed momentum is around 8.8e-28 Ns. The options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Let me recalculate B, perhaps I messed up the units somewhere.

So I = μ r². Let me go step by step.

Masses: Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu.

μ = (20 *2 )/(20+2) =40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.81818 amu.

Convert μ to kg: 1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg.

1.81818 *1.6605 ≈ (1.8*1.66= approx 2.988) + (0.01818*1.66≈0.02999) → about 3.018 kg? Wait, no, wait: 1.81818 * 1.6605 = ?

Wait, 1.8 * 1.6605 is 2.9889. 0.01818 *1.6605 is approximately 0.0301. So sum is 2.9889 +0.0301 = 3.019. So μ ≈3.019e-27 kg.

r is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters.

I = μ r² = 3.019e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.019e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2076e-46 kg·m².

Then B = h/(8 pi² I) = 6.626e-34 J·s / (8 * (pi)^2 * 1.2076e-46 kg m²).

Calculate the denominator: 8 * pi² = 78.9568. So 78.9568 * 1.2076e-46 = let's compute 78.9568 * 1.2076 ≈ 78.9568 *1.2 =94.748, plus 78.9568 *0.0076≈0.600 → total ~95.348.

So denominator is 95.348e-46 =9.5348e-45.

So B =6.626e-34 /9.5348e-45 ≈ (6.626 /9.5348) * 1e11 → approximately 0.695 *1e11 →6.95e10 s^-1.

So 2B is 1.39e11 s^-1. Then the energy difference for rotational transition is 2B ≈1.39e11 * h? Wait no, wait E_rot is B J (J+1), so the energy difference when J increases by 1 is 2B. So ΔE = 2B = 2 *6.95e10 =1.39e11 J? Wait no, that can't be right because 1.39e11 J is a huge amount of energy. Wait, no, wait, wait:

Wait, actually, E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is in s^-1. So the energy is in Joules when multiplied by h, because E = h * B * J (J+1). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, because B is the rotational constant in terms of s^-1. So E_rot = (h) * B * J (J+1).

Wait wait, no. Let me clarify. The rotational energy levels are E_rot = (ħ² J (J+1)) / (2I), which can be written as E_rot = (h² J (J+1)) / (8 pi² I). So for J=0, E=0; J=1, E = h²/(8 pi² I) * 2.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the energy difference for the vibrational transition and the rotational transition and see which is lower.

Vibrational transition v=0 →v=1: ΔE_vib = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14= 2.6504e-19 J.

Rotational transition J=0 → J=1: ΔE_rot = 2 B h. Because E_rot is (h² J (J+1))/(8 pi² I) → so for J=1, it's (h² *2)/(8 pi² I) = (h²)/(4 pi² I) → the difference from J=0 (0) to J=1 is (h²)/(4 pi² I) = (h * (h/(4 pi² I)) )= h * B, where B is h/(8 pi² I). Wait, no, because B = h/(8 pi² I), so ΔE_rot = 2B * h. Wait wait, let me re-express this.

Wait, B is h/(8 pi² I) s^-1. So E_rot(J) = B h J (J+1). So E_rot(0) =0, E_rot(1)=B h *2. So ΔE_rot = 2 B h.

So compute 2 B h. B is 6.95e10 s^-1. So 2 *6.95e10 *6.626e-34 J·s → 2 *6.95e10 *6.626e-34 = let's compute 6.95e10 *6.626e-34 = (6.95 *6.626) *1e-24 =approx 46.04 *1e-24 =4.604e-23. Multiply by 2: 9.208e-23 J.

So ΔE_rot is about 9.208e-23 J, which is way larger than the vibrational ΔE of 2.65e-19 J. Wait, no, wait 9e-23 is much smaller than 2.65e-19. No, wait 2.65e-19 is bigger than 9e-23. So wait, which transition has a lower energy requirement?

Wait no: 9.2e-23 is less than 2.65e-19. Because 2.65e-19 is 2650e-22 and 9.2e-23 is 92e-23, so 92 is less than 2650. So the rotational transition would require a photon with lower energy than the vibrational transition.

Wait, so that's the opposite of what I thought earlier. So the next lowest state would be J=1, which is a rotational transition, requiring less energy than a vibrational transition.

Wait, that can't be right because the vibrational frequency is given as 4e14 rad/s. Let me compare the two ΔE's.

Vibrational: 2.65e-19 J.

Rotational: 9.2e-23 J.

Which is smaller? 9.2e-23 is smaller than 2.65e-19. So the photon needed for the rotational transition has lower energy. So the molecule would first undergo a rotational transition before a vibrational one. So the correct transition is the rotational one, which requires a lower energy photon.

So the photon's energy should match the rotational transition's energy, which is 9.2e-23 J. Then the momentum p is E/c = (9.2e-23 J)/(3e8 m/s) = 3.066e-31 kg·m/s = 3.066e-31 Ns. But looking at the options, the smallest p is D) 1.4e-28 Ns. Hmm, this doesn't match. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, maybe I messed up the rotational energy calculation. Let me re-calculate ΔE_rot.

Wait, ΔE_rot = 2 B h. B is 6.95e10 s^-1. So 2 *6.95e10 *6.626e-34 = 2*(6.95 *6.626)*1e(-34+10) → 6.95 *6.626 ≈46. So 2*46=92. So 92e-24 J. Which is 9.2e-23 J, as before. So p = E/c =9.2e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 Ns. But none of the options are anywhere near that. So this suggests that perhaps I've made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the next state is a combination of vibration and rotation. Hmm, but that's more complicated. Or perhaps the question is considering the molecule transitioning to the next state in the rotational-vibrational spectrum, which would involve both a vibrational and rotational change. But that's more involved.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the rigid rotor model, not the non-rigid. Because the non-rigid model would include both rotation and vibration, but perhaps the problem is considering the energy levels as a combination of rotation and vibration. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the transition from the ground vibrational state and the ground rotational state (J=0) to the next possible state, which could be either J=1 or v=1. Since the question asks for the lowest possible energy transition, which would be the smaller ΔE.

Wait, but according to our calculation, ΔE_rot is 9.2e-23 J, which is much smaller than ΔE_vib (2.65e-19 J). So the photon should have energy matching the rotational transition.

But that gives p=3.07e-31 Ns, which isn't one of the options. So perhaps I messed up the calculation of B.

Wait another approach: perhaps B is computed using a different formula. Let me think. The rotational constant B is related to the moment of inertia I by B = h/(8 pi² I). So I'm confident in that formula. Alternatively, sometimes B is given in terms of cm^-1, but I'm not sure that's relevant here.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy difference in terms of B and see if it matches the options.

Wait, the options are in the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28 Ns. Let's see: E=pc, so p = E/(c) = (h * B * 2) / (c).

Because ΔE_rot =2 B h.

Wait, so p = (2 B h ) / (c) .

Plugging in B =6.95e10 s^-1, h=6.626e-34 J·s, c=3e8 m/s.

p = (2 *6.95e10 *6.626e-34 ) /3e8.

Compute numerator: 2*6.95e10 =1.39e11; 1.39e11 *6.626e-34 = (1.39 *6.626) *1e(-23) → 9.21 *1e-23 =9.21e-23.

Denominator: 3e8.

So p =9.21e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 kg·m/s =3.07e-31 Ns. Still not matching any options.

Hmm, none of the options are close. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption about the transition.

Wait, perhaps the molecule transitions from v=0, J=0 to v=1, J=0. That would be a pure vibrational transition. So the energy difference is h w =2.65e-19 J, and p=2.65e-19/(3e8)= 8.83e-28 Ns. Let's see, the options are A:1.9e-28, D:1.4e-28. So 8.8e-28 isn't an option. Closest is A, which is about half of that.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering a transition where both rotation and vibration change. But that's more complicated, and perhaps not the intention here.

Wait, maybe I'm missing a factor of 1/2 somewhere. Let me think about the vibrational energy levels again. The vibrational energy levels are E_vib = (v + 1/2) h w. So the transition from v=0 to v=1 is ΔE = (3/2 -1/2) h w = h w. So yes, that's correct.

Another possibility: perhaps the question is using the reduced mass in a different way. Wait, I think I did the reduced mass correctly. μ = (m_x m_y)/(m_x + m_y) = (20 *2)/(22) =40/22=20/11. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the moment of inertia correctly. Let me try again.

μ = (20 amu *2 amu)/(22 amu) =40/22 amu= 20/11 amu ≈1.818 amu.

But 1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ =1.818 *1.6605e-27 kg= approx 3.019e-27 kg.

r =2e-10 m.

I = μ r² =3.019e-27 * (2e-10)^2 =3.019e-27 *4e-20=1.2076e-46 kg·m².

So B = h/(8 pi² I) =6.626e-34 / (8 * pi^2 *1.2076e-46).

Compute denominator: 8 pi^2 ≈78.9568; 78.9568 *1.2076e-46 =let me compute 78.9568 *1.2076 →approx 78.9568 *1.2=94.748, 78.9568 *0.0076≈0.600 → total ~95.348. So denominator 95.348e-46=9.5348e-45.

So B=6.626e-34 /9.5348e-45 =approx 6.94e10 s^-1.

Hmm, same as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about a pure rotational or vibrational transition but about the first excited state, which is a combination of both. But I'm not sure.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering the Raman transition, which involves changing rotational state without changing vibrational state. But the question is about the next state with the lowest energy, which could be a rotational change.

Wait, but according to our calculations, the rotational transition requires a photon of much lower energy than the vibrational transition. So why doesn't the photon's momentum match any of the options?

Wait, let me compute the correct values again.

ΔE_rot =2 B h = 2 *6.94e10 *6.626e-34 =?

Wait, 6.94e10 *6.626e-34 = (6.94 *6.626) *1e-24. 6.94 *6.626 ≈46 (since 7*6.6 is 46.2). So 46e-24 →4.6e-23. Multiply by 2: 9.2e-23 J.

p=9.2e-23 J /3e8 m/s =3.07e-31 kg·m/s =3.07e-31 Ns. Not matching any options.

Another thought: perhaps the transition is from J=0 to J=2, which would have ΔE_rot=4 B h. But that would be even higher energy, which doesn't help.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the molecule transitioning from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=0), which is a pure vibrational transition. Then ΔE =h w=2.65e-19 J, p=8.83e-28 Ns. The options don't have this, but option A is 1.9e-28, which is roughly half. Did I make a mistake in computing h w?

Wait, h=6.626e-34 J·s, w=4e14 rad/s. So E=h w=6.626e-34 *4e14 = (6.626 *4) *1e-20 =26.504e-20 J →2.6504e-19 J. So that's correct.

Wait, but maybe I should calculate using the vibrational frequency in terms of cm^-1 or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the first excited rotational state within the same vibrational state. But that would require a higher energy than the vibrational transition, which doesn't make sense for the lowest possible energy.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the photon's momentum when the molecule changes to the next state, which could be a transition to the (v=0, J=1) state, which is a rotational transition. Then, the energy difference is 2 B h, so 9.2e-23 J. Momentum p=9.2e-23 /3e8=3.07e-31 Ns. But that's not an option.

Wait, let me think about the given options again. The options are in the range of 1e-27 to 2e-27 Ns, except option A and D, which are 1.9e-28 and 1.4e-28, which are lower. So my calculated p is 3e-31, which is way below the options.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me try to recompute B.

I =μ r² =3.019e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 =3.019e-27 *4e-20 =1.2076e-46 kg m².

B = h/(8 pi² I) → h=6.626e-34 J s.

So B=6.626e-34 / (8 pi² *1.2076e-46) → denominator: 8 pi² is about 78.96, multiplied by 1.2076e-46 →78.96 *1.2076e-46 = 78.96 *1.2076=approx 95.3. So 95.3e-46 =9.53e-45.

So B=6.626e-34 /9.53e-45 = (6.626 /9.53) *1e11 →approx 0.695 *1e11 =6.95e10 s^-1.

Hmm, same as before. So I think that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the error is in the formula for B. Let me think again. The rotational constant B is h/(8 pi² I), which is correct. Alternatively, sometimes it's written as B = ħ/(2 pi I), but ħ is h/(2 pi). So, B= (h/(2 pi)) / (2 pi I) )=h/(4 pi² I). Wait, is that correct? Let me compute that.

Wait, no: E_rot = (ħ² J (J+1))/(2I). Substitute ħ =h/(2 pi).

E_rot = (h²/(4 pi²) J (J+1))/(2I) )= h² J (J+1) / (8 pi² I).

So E_rot = (h^2 / (8 pi² I)) J (J+1). So the rotational constant B is h^2/(8 pi² I) = (h/(8 pi² I)) * h. Wait, no. Because E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is h^2/(8 pi² I) / h? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps B is h/(8 pi² I), which is in s^-1, and E_rot = B J (J+1) h. Because E_rot = (h B) J (J+1).

So, for J=0, E=0. For J=1, E=2 h B. So the energy difference is 2 h B.

Wait, so ΔE_rot =2 h B.

So, with B=6.95e10 s^-1, ΔE_rot =2 *6.626e-34 *6.95e10 =2*(6.626e-34 *6.95e10) →6.626e-34 *6.95e10≈4.6e-23 → multiplied by 2 gives 9.2e-23 J. So same as before.

Thus, the p=9.2e-23 /3e8=3.07e-31 Ns, which is way lower than any option presented.

So perhaps I'm missing something in the question. Let me read it again.

The question says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which is the non-rigid rotor model. So it's considering both rotation and vibration. The molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state. So that's v=0 and J=0.

The next state with the lowest possible energy would be the one with the smallest possible ΔE. So between the vibrational transition (v=1, J=0) and rotational transition (v=0, J=1), which has smaller ΔE.

Earlier calculation says the rotational transition has a smaller ΔE. But according to the calculation, this would require a photon of much less energy than the vibrational transition. So why the options don't match that.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the molecule transitioning to the next state in terms of quantum numbers, without considering the actual energy difference. Like, perhaps the next state is (v=1, J=0), which is a higher energy than (v=0, J=1), but the question is about the next state in terms of quantum numbers regardless of energy.

But the question says 'next state with the lowest possible energy', so it's about the smallest energy increase.

Hmm, perhaps the mistake is that I should be using the vibrational frequency to calculate the photon's momentum. So the photon's momentum is h w /c.

So p= (h w )/(c) → (6.626e-34 *4e14 )/(3e8) = (2.65e-19 )/(3e8 )= 8.83e-28 Ns. But that's not an option.

Wait, the options are:

A) 1.9e-28

B)2.3e-27

C)1.1e-27

D)1.4e-28

Only option A is close to this, but it's about half.

Wait, maybe the question is considering the transition from J=0 to J=2, which would have a higher energy, but that's not the case for the next lowest state.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy. Let me think about the rotational energy again. Maybe the question is considering spin or something else, but no, it's about rotation.

Wait, perhaps the rotational transition is from J=0 to J=1, which requires a photon with energy of 2B h, but perhaps B is in a different unit?

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the formula for the rotational-vibrational spectrum. The energy levels are given by E = E_vib + E_rot. So for the ground state, E = (1/2) h w + 0. The next state would be either (v=1, J=0) or (v=0, J=1), whichever has lower energy.

As calculated earlier, ΔE_rot is about 9.2e-23 J, and ΔE_vib is 2.65e-19 J. So the rotational transition requires less energy, so the photon's energy should be 9.2e-23 J, leading to p=3.07e-31 Ns. But this is not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the molecule transitioning to the next state in the rotational-vibrational spectrum, which is a combination of both. But that's more complicated and beyond the scope of the given data.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the molecule is in the first excited vibrational state, but that's not possible because the question states it's in the fundamental state.

I'm stuck. Let me think differently: perhaps the question is about the photon's momentum when the molecule transitions to the next state, but I'm not considering whether it's an allowed transition or not. But the question doesn't specify selection rules, so I think any transition is allowed.

Another thought: perhaps the molecule is a rigid rotor, not non-rigid. Let me see. The rigid rotor model ignores vibrational energy, so the energy is purely rotational. But the question says non-rigid, so that's not applicable.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using the moment of inertia as (m_x + m_y) r², not the reduced mass. Let me try that.

Moment of inertia I = (mx + my) r².

mx=20 amu, my=2 amu → total =22 amu → 22 *1.6605e-27 kg =3.6531e-26 kg.

r=2e-10 m.

I=3.6531e-26 kg * (2e-10)^2 =3.6531e-26 *4e-20=1.4612e-45 kg·m².

B =h/(8 pi² I)=6.626e-34/(8 pi² *1.4612e-45).

Denominator:8 pi²≈78.96, 78.96 *1.4612e-45≈115.3e-45=1.153e-43.

So B=6.626e-34 /1.153e-43≈5.74e9 s^-1.

Then ΔE_rot =2 B h=2 *5.74e9 *6.626e-34 = (2 *5.74 *6.626) *1e-25 → (approx 76.4) *1e-25 →7.64e-24 J.

p=7.64e-24 /3e8 =2.547e-32 Ns. Even smaller, so not matching any options.

Hmm, that's even worse. So perhaps using the reduced mass is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting the photon to have a momentum calculated from the vibrational energy, so p= h w /c = (6.626e-34 *4e14 ) /3e8 = (2.65e-19 )/(3e8 )=8.83e-28 Ns. But the options don't have that. The closest option is A, which is 1.9e-28.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the value of w. The given angular frequency is 4e14 rad/s. Let me check: if I use w =4e14 rad/s, E= h w =6.626e-34 *4e14= 2.65e-19 J. Correct.

Another thought: perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=1), which would involve both a vibrational and rotational change. But whether that has lower energy than the pure vibrational transition I'm not sure. Let me compute that.

ΔE = h w + 2 B h. So 2.65e-19 J +9.2e-23 J ≈2.66e-19 J. So even higher than the pure vibrational transition.

Thus, the required photon energy would be 2.66e-19 J, p=8.87e-28 Ns. But no option matches.

Wait, looking at the options again. Option C is 1.1e-27 Ns. Let me see what energy that would correspond to. p=1.1e-27 Ns. E=pc=1.1e-27 *3e8=3.3e-19 J. Which is larger than the vibrational transition's 2.65e-19 J. Hmm, but why would the photon's energy be higher than the vibrational transition?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the molecule transitioning to a higher vibrational state with a change in rotation. But that doesn't make sense for the lowest energy transition.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the vibrational energy. Let me re-calculate E_vib.

E_vib = h w =6.626e-34 J·s *4e14 rad/s =2.65e-19 J. Correct.

Wait, the options don't have a value close to 8.8e-28. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the bond length is given in angstroms, and I forgot to convert. No, I did convert 2 angstroms to 2e-10 meters.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the first excited state, which is a combination of both rotational and vibrational changes, but that's not the case for the lowest possible energy.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible options and see which one aligns with a possible miscalculation.

The options are:

A)1.9e-28 → which is close to 2e-28.

B)2.3e-27 → much larger.

C)1.1e-27 → about 1e-27.

D)1.4e-28 → about 1e-28.

Earlier, when I considered the vibrational transition, I got p=8.8e-28 Ns, which is about 9e-28. Closest option is A)1.9e-28, but it's about half. Alternatively, perhaps I made a calculation error in the rotational energy.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the vibrational transition but with a different frequency. Alternatively, perhaps the given w is in cm^-1, but I don't think so—w is given in rad/s.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the photon's energy is the sum of the rotational and vibrational transitions. But that would be higher.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next state as the first excited state in the rotational spectrum within the same vibrational state, which would be J=1. But that's what I discussed earlier, leading to a much lower p than any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not considering the rotational energy, but only the vibrational. Then the photon's p would be 8.8e-28, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the moment of inertia incorrectly. Let me think about another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the photon's momentum when the molecule absorbs it to transition to the next state, and the next state is the first excited vibrational state, and that's it.

So, if the photon's energy is h w, then p= h w /c = (6.626e-34 *4e14 )/(3e8 )= (2.65e-19 )/(3e8 )=8.83e-28 kg·m/s=8.83e-28 Ns. Not matching any option.

But perhaps the problem is considering a transition from J=0 to J=2, which would double the energy.

Wait, E_rot for J=2 is B*2*3=6 B. So ΔE_rot from J=0 to J=2 is 6B h. Let me compute that: 6 *6.95e10 *6.626e-34 =6 *4.6e-23=2.76e-22 J. p=2.76e-22 /3e8=9.2e-31 Ns. Still way below the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next vibrational state and the next rotational state simultaneously, but that's more energy.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Perhaps I should just choose the option that corresponds to the vibrational transition, even though it doesn't match. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Wait, perhaps I should compute B using the formula B = (1/(8 pi² I c)), but that's for wavenumbers. Let me think. No, because B is in s^-1 when using E_rot = B J (J+1).

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the rotational energy is E_rot = B J (J+1), and B is in cm^-1. Wait, no, that's not correct. B in cm^-1 is the rotational constant in terms of wavenumbers, which is B' = B / c, where c is the speed of light. So perhaps I should calculate B in cm^-1 first.

Let me compute B' = B / c. B is 6.95e10 s^-1. So B' =6.95e10 /3e8=2.317e2 cm^-1.

But I'm not sure how that helps. Because the energy levels are in terms of B, which is in s^-1.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the photon's energy as the sum of the rotational and vibrational transitions, but that's not the case.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. The correct transition is the rotational one, but the options don't match. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the vibrational transition, and the correct option is not listed. But that can't be, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the photon's momentum is calculated using E=pc, but I used E= h w, but the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state and switches to the next state. Perhaps the next state is a combination of vibration and rotation, but that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from J=0 to J=2, but that's not the next state.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next state in the vibrational-rigid rotor model, which would involve both a vibrational and rotational change. But I'm not familiar with such a model.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the photon's momentum as p = h/(lambda), and lambda is c/f, but I think that's the same as p=E/c.

Another possibility: perhaps the question is mixing up the concepts of rigid and non-rigid rotors. In the rigid rotor model, the energy is purely rotational, but the question specifies non-rigid. So that's not it.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Based on the calculations, the correct photon momentum for the rotational transition is ~3e-31 Ns, which isn't an option. For the vibrational transition, p=8.8e-28 Ns, which is closer to option A (1.9e-28) but still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the vibrational transition, and the calculation for E is correct, but the options have a typo. Or perhaps I'm miscalculating E_vib.

Wait, E_vib = (v + 1/2) h w → the transition from v=0 to v=1 is ΔE= h w. So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering the molecule transitioning to a higher vibrational state with a change in the rotational state. But that would require a higher energy.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the first excited state of the rotation within the same vibrational state. So, E =2 B h. Which we calculated as 9.2e-23 J, p=3.07e-31 Ns. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the photon's momentum as p = h/(lambda), but where lambda is the wavelength corresponding to the energy difference.

Wait, lambda = hc/E. So p = E/c = h/(lambda * c) → no, I think that's the same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the photon's energy as the sum of the rotational and vibrational transitions, but that would be even higher.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the momentum of the molecule after absorbing the photon, not the photon's momentum. But no, the question asks for the photon's momentum.

Hmm, I think I've spent a lot of time on this. Based on the calculations, the correct answer should be around 8.8e-28 Ns for the vibrational transition, but since that's not an option, perhaps the correct approach is to choose the closest option, which is A)1.9e-28. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct answer is C)1.1e-27.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation of E_vib.

E_vib = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14=2.6504e-19 J.

p = E/c =2.6504e-19 /3e8= 8.8347e-28 Ns.

The options are:

A)1.9e-28

D)1.4e-28

Hmm, perhaps I should recheck the initial setup. Wait, perhaps the molecule's fundamental state is the first vibrational state (v=1), and it's transitioning to v=2. But that's not correct because the fundamental state is v=0.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the molecule is in the ground state of rotation but not vibration. But no, the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state.

I think I've to conclude that the intended answer is option C)1.1e-27 Ns, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is considering the moment of inertia as I = (m_x + m_y) r², which would give a higher I, leading to a lower B, thus a lower ΔE_rot. Let me compute that.

μ = m_x + m_y =20 +2=22 amu=22 *1.6605e-27 kg=3.653e-26 kg.

I =3.653e-26 kg * (2e-10)^2=3.653e-26 *4e-20=1.461e-45 kg·m².

B= h/(8 pi² I)=6.626e-34 / (8 pi² *1.461e-45).

Denominator:8 pi²=78.96 →78.96 *1.461e-45=1.153e-43.

B=6.626e-34 /1.153e-43=5.74e9 s^-1.

ΔE_rot=2 B h =2 *5.74e9 *6.626e-34=7.64e-24 J.

p=7.64e-24 /3e8=2.55e-32 Ns. Even smaller.

No, that doesn't help.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the initial calculations, the correct p for the vibrational transition is ~8.8e-28 Ns, which is not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is option C)1.1e-27 Ns, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the rotational transition and the calculated p is 3.07e-31 Ns, but again, not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the rotational energy. Let me recompute the rotational energy difference.

Wait, ΔE_rot =2 B h.

With B=6.95e10 s^-1, h=6.626e-34 J·s.

ΔE_rot=2 *6.95e10 *6.626e-34 =2 * (6.95 *6.626 ) *1e-24 →2 *46.04 *1e-24 →9.208e-23 J.

p=9.208e-23 /3e8=3.07e-31 Ns. No match.

Hmm. I think I'm going to have to go with the vibrational transition, which gives p=8.8e-28 Ns. The closest option is A)1.9e-28, but it's about half. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of E_vib.

Wait, perhaps I should compute E_vib using w in terms of cm^-1. No, because w is given in rad/s.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is considering the transition from v=0 to v=1, and also J=0 to J=1. So the total energy difference would be ΔE= h w +2 B h.

So, E=2.65e-19 J +9.2e-23 J ≈2.65e-19 J.

p=2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28 Ns. Still same as before.

I think I've to conclude that perhaps the intended answer is option C)1.1e-27 Ns, but I'm not sure how. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended for the rotational transition but made a mistake in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the question intended for the photon's momentum to be calculated from the rotational energy, but the calculation leads to p=3e-31 Ns, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the photon's momentum as the product of the angular frequency and the reduced mass. But I don't think that's correct.

Another thought: perhaps the question is using the formula p = m v, where v is the velocity after absorbing the photon. But I don't see how that applies here, as the velocity of the molecule isn't directly given.

Hmm. I think I've to make a choice based on the given options. Since the calculated p for the vibrational transition is ~8.8e-28 Ns, and the closest option is A)1.9e-28, but it's about half, perhaps the correct answer is option A. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and it's option C.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the vibrational energy.

h=6.626e-34 J·s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

E= h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.6504e-19 J.

p=E/c=2.6504e-19 /3e8=8.8347e-28 Ns.

No, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using w in terms of cm^-1. Let me see: 4e14 rad/s is equivalent to (4e14)/(2 pi) cm^-1 *c. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the given w is in cm^-1. But the question says w=4e14 rad/s, which is about 4e14 rad/s ≈6.368e13 Hz → which is in the infrared region, which makes sense.

So, I think the correct answer is not among the options, but the intended one is option A)1.9e-28 Ns. But I can't be certain. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the answer based on the rotational transition, but I can't see how that leads to any of the options.

After a lot of thinking, I'll go with the vibrational transition's p=8.8e-28 Ns, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option A)1.9e-28 Ns.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration (non-rigid rotor) model. The molecule is in its fundamental state (lowest energy state, corresponding to \(v=0\) and \(J=0\)), and the question asks for the momentum of a photon required to transition the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Energy Transitions**: The next state with the lowest energy could involve either a vibrational transition (\(v=0 \to v=1\)) or a rotational transition (\(J=0 \to J=1\)). The energy differences for these transitions are compared:
   - **Vibrational Transition**: The energy difference is \(\Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega\), where \(\omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s}\). Substituting \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\), \(\Delta E_{\text{vib}} = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \times 4 \times 10^{14} = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\).
   - **Rotational Transition**: The rotational constant \(B\) is calculated using the reduced mass \(\mu = \frac{m_x m_y}{m_x + m_y}\) and the bond length \(r\). The reduced mass is \(\mu = \frac{20 \, \text{amu} \times 2 \, \text{amu}}{22 \, \text{amu}} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}\), which converts to \(\mu \approx 3.019 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}\). The moment of inertia is \(I = \mu r^2 = 3.019 \times 10^{-27} \times (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.2076 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2\). The rotational constant is \(B = \frac{h}{8 \pi^2 I} = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{8 \pi^2 \times 1.2076 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 6.95 \times 10^{10} \, \text{s}^{-1}\). The energy difference for the rotational transition is \(\Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2Bh = 2 \times 6.95 \times 10^{10} \times 6.626 \times 10^{-34} = 9.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\).

2. **Comparison of Transitions**: The vibrational transition requires significantly more energy (\(2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\)) than the rotational transition (\(9.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\)). Therefore, the next state with the lowest energy corresponds to the rotational transition.

3. **Photon Momentum**: The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by \(p = \frac{E}{c}\), where \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\). For the rotational transition:
   \[
   p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.2 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns}.
   \]
   This value is far smaller than any of the provided options.

4. **Vibrational Transition as a Possible Interpretation**: If the problem instead considers the vibrational transition, the photon momentum is:
   \[
   p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}.
   \]
   This value is also not directly listed among the options, but the closest option is **A) \(1.9 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}\)**.

5. **Conclusion**: The calculations suggest that the rotational transition requires a photon with momentum \(3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns}\), which does not match any of the options. If the problem instead considers the vibrational transition, the closest option is **A**. Given the provided options, **A** is the most reasonable choice.

Answer: A

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about diatomic molecules and their energy states. Hmm. Let me try to break it down.

The question says we have a diatomic molecule made of elements X and Y. They're modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is the non-rigid rotor model. Wait, the non-rigid rotor model considers both rotational and vibrational energy states. Right, because rigid rotor is just rotation and doesn't account for bond vibrations.

The molecule is in its fundamental state. Oh wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, both vibrationally and rotationally. So, the ground state in both aspects. Now, the question is about what momentum a photon should have to make the molecule switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh, so it's about absorbing a photon and transitioning to the next energy level.

Hmm, but what's the next state? The next lowest state would involve the molecule moving to the next higher energy level. In the non-rigid rotor model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states.

Wait, the molecule is currently in its fundamental state, which is the first vibrational level (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (probably the ground rotational state, which is J=0 or J=1? Wait, for a diatomic molecule, the rotational states start at J=0, but in the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. But since this is the non-rigid rotor, maybe the energy levels are a bit different, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering a simple two-level system, like a vibrational transition.

Wait, the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So, the lowest energy transition would be from the ground state to the first excited state. But what is the ground state? If the molecule is at the fundamental vibrational state (v=0), and the lowest rotational state (J=0), then the next possible state could be either increasing the vibrational state (v=1) or increasing the rotational state (J=1). But which transition has lower energy? Because the photon's energy needs to match the energy difference, so which one is smaller.

Wait, the energy differences in rotation and vibration can vary. Vibrational transitions usually have higher energy gaps than rotational. Let me think: the vibrational energy levels are given by E_vib = (v + 1/2) h w, where w is the angular frequency. The rotational energy is E_rot = B J (J+1), with B being the rotational constant. So, the energy difference for a vibrational transition from v=0 to v=1 is h w. For a rotational transition, say from J=0 to J=1, the energy difference is B [1*(1+1) - 0] = 2B.

So which of these is smaller, h w or 2B? Looking at the given data: w is 4e14 rad/s. Let me compute h w. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. So E_vib = h*w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Now, what's B? The rotational constant B is given by (h)/(8 pi² I c), where I is the moment of inertia and c is the speed of light? Wait, no, I think B is (h)/(8 pi² I). Let me get the formula right. The rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), and B is (h)/(8 pi² I). Alternatively, sometimes it's written as B = (ħ²)/(2 I), but I'm not sure. Wait, no. Let me think about the moment of inertia I.

The moment of inertia I for a diatomic molecule is I = μ r^2, where μ is the reduced mass and r is the bond length. The reduced mass μ is (m_x * m_y)/(m_x + m_y). Oh, right, because it's the two atoms rotating around their center of mass.

So, given the masses: Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) ) amu. That's 40 / 22 = approximately 1.818 amu. But I need to convert that into kilograms. 1 amu is about 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ let's compute: 1.818 * 1.6605 is about 3.022. So 3.022e-27 kg.

The bond length r is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so r = 2e-10 m.

So I = μ r² = 3.022e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2. Let's compute that: (2e-10)^2 is 4e-20. So I = 3.022e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2088e-46 kg·m².

Now, B is (h)/(8 pi² I). Let me calculate that. h is 6.626e-34 J·s. So B = 6.626e-34 / (8 * pi² * 1.2088e-46).

Let me compute the denominator first: 8 * pi² ≈ 8 *9.8696 ≈ 78.9568. So denominator is 78.9568 *1.2088e-46 ≈ 78.9568 * 1.2088 is approximately 95.4. So denominator is 95.4e-46 ≈9.54e-45.

So B = 6.626e-34 /9.54e-45. Let's compute that: 6.626e-34 /9.54e-45 = (6.626 /9.54) *1e11 ≈ 0.694 *1e11 = 6.94e10 s^-1.

Wait, that seems too high. Wait, wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, denominator: 8 pi² I. So 8 * pi² is about 78.96. So 78.96 * 1.2088e-46 kg m². 78.96 *1.2088 is approximately 95.4. So 95.4e-46 kg m².

So 8 pi² I =95.4e-46 =9.54e-45.

So B = h/(8 pi² I) = 6.626e-34 /9.54e-45. Let me compute that as (6.626 /9.54) *1e( -34 +45) → (0.694) *1e11 → 6.94e10 s^-1.

Wait, that's a very high frequency. Hmm, but maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Alternatively, perhaps B is (h c)/(8 pi² I), but I'm not sure. Wait, no, the energy levels for rotation are E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is in cm^-1, but when calculating in terms of J, it's just B as the rotational constant in s^-1. Alternatively, maybe I should have used B = ħ²/(2I), but I'm not confident.

Wait, let me think again. The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = (ħ² J (J+1))/(2 I), where ħ is h/(2 pi). So E_rot = (h² J (J+1))/(8 pi² I). So for J=0, E=0. For J=1, E = (h² *2)/(8 pi² I) = h²/(4 pi² I) * (1/2). Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, the rotational constant B is defined as h/(8 pi² I c), where c is the speed of light, but that would be if we're using wavenumbers. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the terms. Let me look up the formula in my notes. Oh wait, in the context of this problem, perhaps I should proceed with the information I have.

Wait, I'm getting B =6.94e10 s^-1. Let's see what the energy difference is for a rotational transition from J=0 to J=1. The energy difference ΔE_rot would be E(J=1) - E(J=0) = B * [1*2 - 0] = 2B. So that's 2 *6.94e10 =1.388e11 J.

Wait, but that's way larger than the vibrational energy difference. Earlier, E_vib was 2.65e-19 J. So the vibrational transition is way lower in energy. So the molecule would absorb a photon with energy hν = E_vib, which is 2.65e-19 J.

But wait, the question isn't about the energy of the photon, it's about the momentum of the photon. Oh right, because the problem asks for the momentum p of the absorbed photon.

Wait, the energy of a photon is E=pc, where p is momentum and c is the speed of light. Because for photons, E=pc (since their mass is zero). So p = E/(c).

So, if the photon's energy is 2.65e-19 J, then p = (2.65e-19 J) / (3e8 m/s) ≈ 8.83e-28 kg·m/s. Wait, but looking at the options, none of them match that.

Wait, the options are:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B) 2.3e-27 Ns

C) 1.1e-27 Ns

D) 1.4e-28 Ns

Wait, 1 Ns is 1 kg·m/s. So our computed p is approximately 8.83e-28 kg·m/s = 8.83e-28 Ns. But looking at the options, the closest is option A: 1.9e-28, but that's much lower.

Hmm, that's a problem. So either I made a mistake in the calculation, or perhaps I'm choosing the wrong transition.

Wait, maybe the next state isn't a vibrational transition but a rotational one, but that would require a higher energy photon. But the question says "next state with the lowest possible energy." So perhaps the lowest energy transition is the vibrational one. But according to our earlier calculation, the rotational transition's energy is way higher than the vibrational, so the photon's energy would be in the infrared or something.

Wait, but the computed momentum is around 8.8e-28 Ns. The options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Let me recalculate B, perhaps I messed up the units somewhere.

So I = μ r². Let me go step by step.

Masses: Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu.

μ = (20 *2 )/(20+2) =40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.81818 amu.

Convert μ to kg: 1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg.

1.81818 *1.6605 ≈ (1.8*1.66= approx 2.988) + (0.01818*1.66≈0.02999) → about 3.018 kg? Wait, no, wait: 1.81818 * 1.6605 = ?

Wait, 1.8 * 1.6605 is 2.9889. 0.01818 *1.6605 is approximately 0.0301. So sum is 2.9889 +0.0301 = 3.019. So μ ≈3.019e-27 kg.

r is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters.

I = μ r² = 3.019e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.019e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2076e-46 kg·m².

Then B = h/(8 pi² I) = 6.626e-34 J·s / (8 * (pi)^2 * 1.2076e-46 kg m²).

Calculate the denominator: 8 * pi² = 78.9568. So 78.9568 * 1.2076e-46 = let's compute 78.9568 * 1.2076 ≈ 78.9568 *1.2 =94.748, plus 78.9568 *0.0076≈0.600 → total ~95.348.

So denominator is 95.348e-46 =9.5348e-45.

So B =6.626e-34 /9.5348e-45 ≈ (6.626 /9.5348) * 1e11 → approximately 0.695 *1e11 →6.95e10 s^-1.

So 2B is 1.39e11 s^-1. Then the energy difference for rotational transition is 2B ≈1.39e11 * h? Wait no, wait E_rot is B J (J+1), so the energy difference when J increases by 1 is 2B. So ΔE = 2B = 2 *6.95e10 =1.39e11 J? Wait no, that can't be right because 1.39e11 J is a huge amount of energy. Wait, no, wait, wait:

Wait, actually, E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is in s^-1. So the energy is in Joules when multiplied by h, because E = h * B * J (J+1). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, because B is the rotational constant in terms of s^-1. So E_rot = (h) * B * J (J+1).

Wait wait, no. Let me clarify. The rotational energy levels are E_rot = (ħ² J (J+1)) / (2I), which can be written as E_rot = (h² J (J+1)) / (8 pi² I). So for J=0, E=0; J=1, E = h²/(8 pi² I) * 2.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the energy difference for the vibrational transition and the rotational transition and see which is lower.

Vibrational transition v=0 →v=1: ΔE_vib = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14= 2.6504e-19 J.

Rotational transition J=0 → J=1: ΔE_rot = 2 B h. Because E_rot is (h² J (J+1))/(8 pi² I) → so for J=1, it's (h² *2)/(8 pi² I) = (h²)/(4 pi² I) → the difference from J=0 (0) to J=1 is (h²)/(4 pi² I) = (h * (h/(4 pi² I)) )= h * B, where B is h/(8 pi² I). Wait, no, because B = h/(8 pi² I), so ΔE_rot = 2B * h. Wait wait, let me re-express this.

Wait, B is h/(8 pi² I) s^-1. So E_rot(J) = B h J (J+1). So E_rot(0) =0, E_rot(1)=B h *2. So ΔE_rot = 2 B h.

So compute 2 B h. B is 6.95e10 s^-1. So 2 *6.95e10 *6.626e-34 J·s → 2 *6.95e10 *6.626e-34 = let's compute 6.95e10 *6.626e-34 = (6.95 *6.626) *1e-24 =approx 46.04 *1e-24 =4.604e-23. Multiply by 2: 9.208e-23 J.

So ΔE_rot is about 9.208e-23 J, which is way larger than the vibrational ΔE of 2.65e-19 J. Wait, no, wait 9e-23 is much smaller than 2.65e-19. No, wait 2.65e-19 is bigger than 9e-23. So wait, which transition has a lower energy requirement?

Wait no: 9.2e-23 is less than 2.65e-19. Because 2.65e-19 is 2650e-22 and 9.2e-23 is 92e-23, so 92 is less than 2650. So the rotational transition would require a photon with lower energy than the vibrational transition.

Wait, so that's the opposite of what I thought earlier. So the next lowest state would be J=1, which is a rotational transition, requiring less energy than a vibrational transition.

Wait, that can't be right because the vibrational frequency is given as 4e14 rad/s. Let me compare the two ΔE's.

Vibrational: 2.65e-19 J.

Rotational: 9.2e-23 J.

Which is smaller? 9.2e-23 is smaller than 2.65e-19. So the photon needed for the rotational transition has lower energy. So the molecule would first undergo a rotational transition before a vibrational one. So the correct transition is the rotational one, which requires a lower energy photon.

So the photon's energy should match the rotational transition's energy, which is 9.2e-23 J. Then the momentum p is E/c = (9.2e-23 J)/(3e8 m/s) = 3.066e-31 kg·m/s = 3.066e-31 Ns. But looking at the options, the smallest p is D) 1.4e-28 Ns. Hmm, this doesn't match. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, maybe I messed up the rotational energy calculation. Let me re-calculate ΔE_rot.

Wait, ΔE_rot = 2 B h. B is 6.95e10 s^-1. So 2 *6.95e10 *6.626e-34 = 2*(6.95 *6.626)*1e(-34+10) → 6.95 *6.626 ≈46. So 2*46=92. So 92e-24 J. Which is 9.2e-23 J, as before. So p = E/c =9.2e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 Ns. But none of the options are anywhere near that. So this suggests that perhaps I've made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the next state is a combination of vibration and rotation. Hmm, but that's more complicated. Or perhaps the question is considering the molecule transitioning to the next state in the rotational-vibrational spectrum, which would involve both a vibrational and rotational change. But that's more involved.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the rigid rotor model, not the non-rigid. Because the non-rigid model would include both rotation and vibration, but perhaps the problem is considering the energy levels as a combination of rotation and vibration. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the transition from the ground vibrational state and the ground rotational state (J=0) to the next possible state, which could be either J=1 or v=1. Since the question asks for the lowest possible energy transition, which would be the smaller ΔE.

Wait, but according to our calculation, ΔE_rot is 9.2e-23 J, which is much smaller than ΔE_vib (2.65e-19 J). So the photon should have energy matching the rotational transition.

But that gives p=3.07e-31 Ns, which isn't one of the options. So perhaps I messed up the calculation of B.

Wait another approach: perhaps B is computed using a different formula. Let me think. The rotational constant B is related to the moment of inertia I by B = h/(8 pi² I). So I'm confident in that formula. Alternatively, sometimes B is given in terms of cm^-1, but I'm not sure that's relevant here.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy difference in terms of B and see if it matches the options.

Wait, the options are in the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28 Ns. Let's see: E=pc, so p = E/(c) = (h * B * 2) / (c).

Because ΔE_rot =2 B h.

Wait, so p = (2 B h ) / (c) .

Plugging in B =6.95e10 s^-1, h=6.626e-34 J·s, c=3e8 m/s.

p = (2 *6.95e10 *6.626e-34 ) /3e8.

Compute numerator: 2*6.95e10 =1.39e11; 1.39e11 *6.626e-34 = (1.39 *6.626) *1e(-23) → 9.21 *1e-23 =9.21e-23.

Denominator: 3e8.

So p =9.21e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 kg·m/s =3.07e-31 Ns. Still not matching any options.

Hmm, none of the options are close. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption about the transition.

Wait, perhaps the molecule transitions from v=0, J=0 to v=1, J=0. That would be a pure vibrational transition. So the energy difference is h w =2.65e-19 J, and p=2.65e-19/(3e8)= 8.83e-28 Ns. Let's see, the options are A:1.9e-28, D:1.4e-28. So 8.8e-28 isn't an option. Closest is A, which is about half of that.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering a transition where both rotation and vibration change. But that's more complicated, and perhaps not the intention here.

Wait, maybe I'm missing a factor of 1/2 somewhere. Let me think about the vibrational energy levels again. The vibrational energy levels are E_vib = (v + 1/2) h w. So the transition from v=0 to v=1 is ΔE = (3/2 -1/2) h w = h w. So yes, that's correct.

Another possibility: perhaps the question is using the reduced mass in a different way. Wait, I think I did the reduced mass correctly. μ = (m_x m_y)/(m_x + m_y) = (20 *2)/(22) =40/22=20/11. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the moment of inertia correctly. Let me try again.

μ = (20 amu *2 amu)/(22 amu) =40/22 amu= 20/11 amu ≈1.818 amu.

But 1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ =1.818 *1.6605e-27 kg= approx 3.019e-27 kg.

r =2e-10 m.

I = μ r² =3.019e-27 * (2e-10)^2 =3.019e-27 *4e-20=1.2076e-46 kg·m².

So B = h/(8 pi² I) =6.626e-34 / (8 * pi^2 *1.2076e-46).

Compute denominator: 8 pi^2 ≈78.9568; 78.9568 *1.2076e-46 =let me compute 78.9568 *1.2076 →approx 78.9568 *1.2=94.748, 78.9568 *0.0076≈0.600 → total ~95.348. So denominator 95.348e-46=9.5348e-45.

So B=6.626e-34 /9.5348e-45 =approx 6.94e10 s^-1.

Hmm, same as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about a pure rotational or vibrational transition but about the first excited state, which is a combination of both. But I'm not sure.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering the Raman transition, which involves changing rotational state without changing vibrational state. But the question is about the next state with the lowest energy, which could be a rotational change.

Wait, but according to our calculations, the rotational transition requires a photon of much lower energy than the vibrational transition. So why doesn't the photon's momentum match any of the options?

Wait, let me compute the correct values again.

ΔE_rot =2 B h = 2 *6.94e10 *6.626e-34 =?

Wait, 6.94e10 *6.626e-34 = (6.94 *6.626) *1e-24. 6.94 *6.626 ≈46 (since 7*6.6 is 46.2). So 46e-24 →4.6e-23. Multiply by 2: 9.2e-23 J.

p=9.2e-23 J /3e8 m/s =3.07e-31 kg·m/s =3.07e-31 Ns. Not matching any options.

Another thought: perhaps the transition is from J=0 to J=2, which would have ΔE_rot=4 B h. But that would be even higher energy, which doesn't help.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the molecule transitioning from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=0), which is a pure vibrational transition. Then ΔE =h w=2.65e-19 J, p=8.83e-28 Ns. The options don't have this, but option A is 1.9e-28, which is roughly half. Did I make a mistake in computing h w?

Wait, h=6.626e-34 J·s, w=4e14 rad/s. So E=h w=6.626e-34 *4e14 = (6.626 *4) *1e-20 =26.504e-20 J →2.6504e-19 J. So that's correct.

Wait, but maybe I should calculate using the vibrational frequency in terms of cm^-1 or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the first excited rotational state within the same vibrational state. But that would require a higher energy than the vibrational transition, which doesn't make sense for the lowest possible energy.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the photon's momentum when the molecule changes to the next state, which could be a transition to the (v=0, J=1) state, which is a rotational transition. Then, the energy difference is 2 B h, so 9.2e-23 J. Momentum p=9.2e-23 /3e8=3.07e-31 Ns. But that's not an option.

Wait, let me think about the given options again. The options are in the range of 1e-27 to 2e-27 Ns, except option A and D, which are 1.9e-28 and 1.4e-28, which are lower. So my calculated p is 3e-31, which is way below the options.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me try to recompute B.

I =μ r² =3.019e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 =3.019e-27 *4e-20 =1.2076e-46 kg m².

B = h/(8 pi² I) → h=6.626e-34 J s.

So B=6.626e-34 / (8 pi² *1.2076e-46) → denominator: 8 pi² is about 78.96, multiplied by 1.2076e-46 →78.96 *1.2076e-46 = 78.96 *1.2076=approx 95.3. So 95.3e-46 =9.53e-45.

So B=6.626e-34 /9.53e-45 = (6.626 /9.53) *1e11 →approx 0.695 *1e11 =6.95e10 s^-1.

Hmm, same as before. So I think that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the error is in the formula for B. Let me think again. The rotational constant B is h/(8 pi² I), which is correct. Alternatively, sometimes it's written as B = ħ/(2 pi I), but ħ is h/(2 pi). So, B= (h/(2 pi)) / (2 pi I) )=h/(4 pi² I). Wait, is that correct? Let me compute that.

Wait, no: E_rot = (ħ² J (J+1))/(2I). Substitute ħ =h/(2 pi).

E_rot = (h²/(4 pi²) J (J+1))/(2I) )= h² J (J+1) / (8 pi² I).

So E_rot = (h^2 / (8 pi² I)) J (J+1). So the rotational constant B is h^2/(8 pi² I) = (h/(8 pi² I)) * h. Wait, no. Because E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is h^2/(8 pi² I) / h? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps B is h/(8 pi² I), which is in s^-1, and E_rot = B J (J+1) h. Because E_rot = (h B) J (J+1).

So, for J=0, E=0. For J=1, E=2 h B. So the energy difference is 2 h B.

Wait, so ΔE_rot =2 h B.

So, with B=6.95e10 s^-1, ΔE_rot =2 *6.626e-34 *6.95e10 =2*(6.626e-34 *6.95e10) →6.626e-34 *6.95e10≈4.6e-23 → multiplied by 2 gives 9.2e-23 J. So same as before.

Thus, the p=9.2e-23 /3e8=3.07e-31 Ns, which is way lower than any option presented.

So perhaps I'm missing something in the question. Let me read it again.

The question says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which is the non-rigid rotor model. So it's considering both rotation and vibration. The molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state. So that's v=0 and J=0.

The next state with the lowest possible energy would be the one with the smallest possible ΔE. So between the vibrational transition (v=1, J=0) and rotational transition (v=0, J=1), which has smaller ΔE.

Earlier calculation says the rotational transition has a smaller ΔE. But according to the calculation, this would require a photon of much less energy than the vibrational transition. So why the options don't match that.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the molecule transitioning to the next state in terms of quantum numbers, without considering the actual energy difference. Like, perhaps the next state is (v=1, J=0), which is a higher energy than (v=0, J=1), but the question is about the next state in terms of quantum numbers regardless of energy.

But the question says 'next state with the lowest possible energy', so it's about the smallest energy increase.

Hmm, perhaps the mistake is that I should be using the vibrational frequency to calculate the photon's momentum. So the photon's momentum is h w /c.

So p= (h w )/(c) → (6.626e-34 *4e14 )/(3e8) = (2.65e-19 )/(3e8 )= 8.83e-28 Ns. But that's not an option.

Wait, the options are:

A) 1.9e-28

B)2.3e-27

C)1.1e-27

D)1.4e-28

Only option A is close to this, but it's about half.

Wait, maybe the question is considering the transition from J=0 to J=2, which would have a higher energy, but that's not the case for the next lowest state.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy. Let me think about the rotational energy again. Maybe the question is considering spin or something else, but no, it's about rotation.

Wait, perhaps the rotational transition is from J=0 to J=1, which requires a photon with energy of 2B h, but perhaps B is in a different unit?

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the formula for the rotational-vibrational spectrum. The energy levels are given by E = E_vib + E_rot. So for the ground state, E = (1/2) h w + 0. The next state would be either (v=1, J=0) or (v=0, J=1), whichever has lower energy.

As calculated earlier, ΔE_rot is about 9.2e-23 J, and ΔE_vib is 2.65e-19 J. So the rotational transition requires less energy, so the photon's energy should be 9.2e-23 J, leading to p=3.07e-31 Ns. But this is not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the molecule transitioning to the next state in the rotational-vibrational spectrum, which is a combination of both. But that's more complicated and beyond the scope of the given data.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the molecule is in the first excited vibrational state, but that's not possible because the question states it's in the fundamental state.

I'm stuck. Let me think differently: perhaps the question is about the photon's momentum when the molecule transitions to the next state, but I'm not considering whether it's an allowed transition or not. But the question doesn't specify selection rules, so I think any transition is allowed.

Another thought: perhaps the molecule is a rigid rotor, not non-rigid. Let me see. The rigid rotor model ignores vibrational energy, so the energy is purely rotational. But the question says non-rigid, so that's not applicable.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using the moment of inertia as (m_x + m_y) r², not the reduced mass. Let me try that.

Moment of inertia I = (mx + my) r².

mx=20 amu, my=2 amu → total =22 amu → 22 *1.6605e-27 kg =3.6531e-26 kg.

r=2e-10 m.

I=3.6531e-26 kg * (2e-10)^2 =3.6531e-26 *4e-20=1.4612e-45 kg·m².

B =h/(8 pi² I)=6.626e-34/(8 pi² *1.4612e-45).

Denominator:8 pi²≈78.96, 78.96 *1.4612e-45≈115.3e-45=1.153e-43.

So B=6.626e-34 /1.153e-43≈5.74e9 s^-1.

Then ΔE_rot =2 B h=2 *5.74e9 *6.626e-34 = (2 *5.74 *6.626) *1e-25 → (approx 76.4) *1e-25 →7.64e-24 J.

p=7.64e-24 /3e8 =2.547e-32 Ns. Even smaller, so not matching any options.

Hmm, that's even worse. So perhaps using the reduced mass is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting the photon to have a momentum calculated from the vibrational energy, so p= h w /c = (6.626e-34 *4e14 ) /3e8 = (2.65e-19 )/(3e8 )=8.83e-28 Ns. But the options don't have that. The closest option is A, which is 1.9e-28.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the value of w. The given angular frequency is 4e14 rad/s. Let me check: if I use w =4e14 rad/s, E= h w =6.626e-34 *4e14= 2.65e-19 J. Correct.

Another thought: perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=1), which would involve both a vibrational and rotational change. But whether that has lower energy than the pure vibrational transition I'm not sure. Let me compute that.

ΔE = h w + 2 B h. So 2.65e-19 J +9.2e-23 J ≈2.66e-19 J. So even higher than the pure vibrational transition.

Thus, the required photon energy would be 2.66e-19 J, p=8.87e-28 Ns. But no option matches.

Wait, looking at the options again. Option C is 1.1e-27 Ns. Let me see what energy that would correspond to. p=1.1e-27 Ns. E=pc=1.1e-27 *3e8=3.3e-19 J. Which is larger than the vibrational transition's 2.65e-19 J. Hmm, but why would the photon's energy be higher than the vibrational transition?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the molecule transitioning to a higher vibrational state with a change in rotation. But that doesn't make sense for the lowest energy transition.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the vibrational energy. Let me re-calculate E_vib.

E_vib = h w =6.626e-34 J·s *4e14 rad/s =2.65e-19 J. Correct.

Wait, the options don't have a value close to 8.8e-28. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the bond length is given in angstroms, and I forgot to convert. No, I did convert 2 angstroms to 2e-10 meters.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the first excited state, which is a combination of both rotational and vibrational changes, but that's not the case for the lowest possible energy.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible options and see which one aligns with a possible miscalculation.

The options are:

A)1.9e-28 → which is close to 2e-28.

B)2.3e-27 → much larger.

C)1.1e-27 → about 1e-27.

D)1.4e-28 → about 1e-28.

Earlier, when I considered the vibrational transition, I got p=8.8e-28 Ns, which is about 9e-28. Closest option is A)1.9e-28, but it's about half. Alternatively, perhaps I made a calculation error in the rotational energy.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the vibrational transition but with a different frequency. Alternatively, perhaps the given w is in cm^-1, but I don't think so—w is given in rad/s.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the photon's energy is the sum of the rotational and vibrational transitions. But that would be higher.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next state as the first excited state in the rotational spectrum within the same vibrational state, which would be J=1. But that's what I discussed earlier, leading to a much lower p than any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not considering the rotational energy, but only the vibrational. Then the photon's p would be 8.8e-28, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the moment of inertia incorrectly. Let me think about another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the photon's momentum when the molecule absorbs it to transition to the next state, and the next state is the first excited vibrational state, and that's it.

So, if the photon's energy is h w, then p= h w /c = (6.626e-34 *4e14 )/(3e8 )= (2.65e-19 )/(3e8 )=8.83e-28 kg·m/s=8.83e-28 Ns. Not matching any option.

But perhaps the problem is considering a transition from J=0 to J=2, which would double the energy.

Wait, E_rot for J=2 is B*2*3=6 B. So ΔE_rot from J=0 to J=2 is 6B h. Let me compute that: 6 *6.95e10 *6.626e-34 =6 *4.6e-23=2.76e-22 J. p=2.76e-22 /3e8=9.2e-31 Ns. Still way below the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next vibrational state and the next rotational state simultaneously, but that's more energy.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Perhaps I should just choose the option that corresponds to the vibrational transition, even though it doesn't match. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Wait, perhaps I should compute B using the formula B = (1/(8 pi² I c)), but that's for wavenumbers. Let me think. No, because B is in s^-1 when using E_rot = B J (J+1).

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the rotational energy is E_rot = B J (J+1), and B is in cm^-1. Wait, no, that's not correct. B in cm^-1 is the rotational constant in terms of wavenumbers, which is B' = B / c, where c is the speed of light. So perhaps I should calculate B in cm^-1 first.

Let me compute B' = B / c. B is 6.95e10 s^-1. So B' =6.95e10 /3e8=2.317e2 cm^-1.

But I'm not sure how that helps. Because the energy levels are in terms of B, which is in s^-1.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the photon's energy as the sum of the rotational and vibrational transitions, but that's not the case.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. The correct transition is the rotational one, but the options don't match. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the vibrational transition, and the correct option is not listed. But that can't be, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the photon's momentum is calculated using E=pc, but I used E= h w, but the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state and switches to the next state. Perhaps the next state is a combination of vibration and rotation, but that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from J=0 to J=2, but that's not the next state.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next state in the vibrational-rigid rotor model, which would involve both a vibrational and rotational change. But I'm not familiar with such a model.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the photon's momentum as p = h/(lambda), and lambda is c/f, but I think that's the same as p=E/c.

Another possibility: perhaps the question is mixing up the concepts of rigid and non-rigid rotors. In the rigid rotor model, the energy is purely rotational, but the question specifies non-rigid. So that's not it.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Based on the calculations, the correct photon momentum for the rotational transition is ~3e-31 Ns, which isn't an option. For the vibrational transition, p=8.8e-28 Ns, which is closer to option A (1.9e-28) but still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the vibrational transition, and the calculation for E is correct, but the options have a typo. Or perhaps I'm miscalculating E_vib.

Wait, E_vib = (v + 1/2) h w → the transition from v=0 to v=1 is ΔE= h w. So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering the molecule transitioning to a higher vibrational state with a change in the rotational state. But that would require a higher energy.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the first excited state of the rotation within the same vibrational state. So, E =2 B h. Which we calculated as 9.2e-23 J, p=3.07e-31 Ns. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the photon's momentum as p = h/(lambda), but where lambda is the wavelength corresponding to the energy difference.

Wait, lambda = hc/E. So p = E/c = h/(lambda * c) → no, I think that's the same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the photon's energy as the sum of the rotational and vibrational transitions, but that would be even higher.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the momentum of the molecule after absorbing the photon, not the photon's momentum. But no, the question asks for the photon's momentum.

Hmm, I think I've spent a lot of time on this. Based on the calculations, the correct answer should be around 8.8e-28 Ns for the vibrational transition, but since that's not an option, perhaps the correct approach is to choose the closest option, which is A)1.9e-28. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct answer is C)1.1e-27.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation of E_vib.

E_vib = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14=2.6504e-19 J.

p = E/c =2.6504e-19 /3e8= 8.8347e-28 Ns.

The options are:

A)1.9e-28

D)1.4e-28

Hmm, perhaps I should recheck the initial setup. Wait, perhaps the molecule's fundamental state is the first vibrational state (v=1), and it's transitioning to v=2. But that's not correct because the fundamental state is v=0.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the molecule is in the ground state of rotation but not vibration. But no, the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state.

I think I've to conclude that the intended answer is option C)1.1e-27 Ns, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is considering the moment of inertia as I = (m_x + m_y) r², which would give a higher I, leading to a lower B, thus a lower ΔE_rot. Let me compute that.

μ = m_x + m_y =20 +2=22 amu=22 *1.6605e-27 kg=3.653e-26 kg.

I =3.653e-26 kg * (2e-10)^2=3.653e-26 *4e-20=1.461e-45 kg·m².

B= h/(8 pi² I)=6.626e-34 / (8 pi² *1.461e-45).

Denominator:8 pi²=78.96 →78.96 *1.461e-45=1.153e-43.

B=6.626e-34 /1.153e-43=5.74e9 s^-1.

ΔE_rot=2 B h =2 *5.74e9 *6.626e-34=7.64e-24 J.

p=7.64e-24 /3e8=2.55e-32 Ns. Even smaller.

No, that doesn't help.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the initial calculations, the correct p for the vibrational transition is ~8.8e-28 Ns, which is not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is option C)1.1e-27 Ns, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the rotational transition and the calculated p is 3.07e-31 Ns, but again, not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the rotational energy. Let me recompute the rotational energy difference.

Wait, ΔE_rot =2 B h.

With B=6.95e10 s^-1, h=6.626e-34 J·s.

ΔE_rot=2 *6.95e10 *6.626e-34 =2 * (6.95 *6.626 ) *1e-24 →2 *46.04 *1e-24 →9.208e-23 J.

p=9.208e-23 /3e8=3.07e-31 Ns. No match.

Hmm. I think I'm going to have to go with the vibrational transition, which gives p=8.8e-28 Ns. The closest option is A)1.9e-28, but it's about half. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of E_vib.

Wait, perhaps I should compute E_vib using w in terms of cm^-1. No, because w is given in rad/s.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is considering the transition from v=0 to v=1, and also J=0 to J=1. So the total energy difference would be ΔE= h w +2 B h.

So, E=2.65e-19 J +9.2e-23 J ≈2.65e-19 J.

p=2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28 Ns. Still same as before.

I think I've to conclude that perhaps the intended answer is option C)1.1e-27 Ns, but I'm not sure how. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended for the rotational transition but made a mistake in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the question intended for the photon's momentum to be calculated from the rotational energy, but the calculation leads to p=3e-31 Ns, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the photon's momentum as the product of the angular frequency and the reduced mass. But I don't think that's correct.

Another thought: perhaps the question is using the formula p = m v, where v is the velocity after absorbing the photon. But I don't see how that applies here, as the velocity of the molecule isn't directly given.

Hmm. I think I've to make a choice based on the given options. Since the calculated p for the vibrational transition is ~8.8e-28 Ns, and the closest option is A)1.9e-28, but it's about half, perhaps the correct answer is option A. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and it's option C.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the vibrational energy.

h=6.626e-34 J·s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

E= h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.6504e-19 J.

p=E/c=2.6504e-19 /3e8=8.8347e-28 Ns.

No, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using w in terms of cm^-1. Let me see: 4e14 rad/s is equivalent to (4e14)/(2 pi) cm^-1 *c. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the given w is in cm^-1. But the question says w=4e14 rad/s, which is about 4e14 rad/s ≈6.368e13 Hz → which is in the infrared region, which makes sense.

So, I think the correct answer is not among the options, but the intended one is option A)1.9e-28 Ns. But I can't be certain. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the answer based on the rotational transition, but I can't see how that leads to any of the options.

After a lot of thinking, I'll go with the vibrational transition's p=8.8e-28 Ns, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option A)1.9e-28 Ns.


The problem involves a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration (non-rigid rotor) model. The molecule is in its fundamental state (lowest energy state, corresponding to \(v=0\) and \(J=0\)), and the question asks for the momentum of a photon required to transition the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Energy Transitions**: The next state with the lowest energy could involve either a vibrational transition (\(v=0 \to v=1\)) or a rotational transition (\(J=0 \to J=1\)). The energy differences for these transitions are compared:
   - **Vibrational Transition**: The energy difference is \(\Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega\), where \(\omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s}\). Substituting \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\), \(\Delta E_{\text{vib}} = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \times 4 \times 10^{14} = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\).
   - **Rotational Transition**: The rotational constant \(B\) is calculated using the reduced mass \(\mu = \frac{m_x m_y}{m_x + m_y}\) and the bond length \(r\). The reduced mass is \(\mu = \frac{20 \, \text{amu} \times 2 \, \text{amu}}{22 \, \text{amu}} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}\), which converts to \(\mu \approx 3.019 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}\). The moment of inertia is \(I = \mu r^2 = 3.019 \times 10^{-27} \times (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.2076 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2\). The rotational constant is \(B = \frac{h}{8 \pi^2 I} = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{8 \pi^2 \times 1.2076 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 6.95 \times 10^{10} \, \text{s}^{-1}\). The energy difference for the rotational transition is \(\Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2Bh = 2 \times 6.95 \times 10^{10} \times 6.626 \times 10^{-34} = 9.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\).

2. **Comparison of Transitions**: The vibrational transition requires significantly more energy (\(2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\)) than the rotational transition (\(9.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\)). Therefore, the next state with the lowest energy corresponds to the rotational transition.

3. **Photon Momentum**: The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by \(p = \frac{E}{c}\), where \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\). For the rotational transition:
   \[
   p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.2 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns}.
   \]
   This value is far smaller than any of the provided options.

4. **Vibrational Transition as a Possible Interpretation**: If the problem instead considers the vibrational transition, the photon momentum is:
   \[
   p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}.
   \]
   This value is also not directly listed among the options, but the closest option is **A) \(1.9 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}\)**.

5. **Conclusion**: The calculations suggest that the rotational transition requires a photon with momentum \(3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns}\), which does not match any of the options. If the problem instead considers the vibrational transition, the closest option is **A**. Given the provided options, **A** is the most reasonable choice.

Answer: A
