Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the problem is about.

The question is about a spin-half particle in a specific superposition state. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. I remember that |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of the σ_z operator. The problem asks for the expectation value of the operator 10σ_z +5σ_x. I need to find this expectation value and choose the correct option from the given choices.

Hmm. So expectation values. I think the expectation value of an operator is found by taking the inner product of the state with the operator acting on the state. Right, the expectation value ⟨O⟩ is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩.

Okay, so the operator here is 10σ_z +5σ_x. Maybe I can break this into two parts: compute the expectation of each term separately and then combine them.

First, let's write down the state vector. The state ψ is 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let me note that sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866, just for a sanity check that the coefficients make sense. The sum of the squares should be 1, right? Let's see: (0.5)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 0.25 + (3/4) = 1. Yep, that's correct.

Now, σ_z has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ respectively. Because |↑⟩ is an eigenstate, the expectation of σ_z is just the coefficient squared times the eigenvalue. Wait, no. Wait, the expectation value of σ_z for ψ is the sum of the probabilities times their respective eigenvalues.

Wait, more accurately, for any state a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, the expectation of σ_z is |a|^2 - |b|^2? Or is it |a|^2*(+1) + |b|^2*(-1). Yes, because |↑⟩ corresponds to eigenvalue +1, |↓⟩ to -1. So σ_z |↑⟩ = +|↑⟩, σ_z |↓⟩ = -|↓⟩.

So for our state, a is 0.5, b is sqrt(3)/2. So |a|^2 is (0.5)^2 = 0.25, and |b|^2 is (3/4) = 0.75. So ⟨σ_z⟩ = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, another way to compute the expectation is to compute the inner product. Let me think. The state is 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. So the bra is 0.5⟨↑| + (sqrt(3)/2)⟨↓|.

So ⟨ψ|σ_z |ψ⟩ would be (0.5⟨↑| + (sqrt(3)/2)⟨↓|) σ_z (0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩ ).

Multiplying this out: 0.5 * 0.5 ⟨↑|σ_z |↑⟩ + 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) ⟨↑|σ_z |↓⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 ⟨↓|σ_z |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)*(sqrt(3)/2) ⟨↓|σ_z |↓⟩.

But σ_z |↑⟩ = |↑⟩, σ_z |↓⟩ = -|↓⟩. So the cross terms would have ⟨↑| -|↓⟩ and ⟨↓| +|↑⟩. Wait, but ⟨↑|σ_z |↓⟩ = ⟨↑| (-|↓⟩) ) = 0 because |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are orthogonal. Similarly, ⟨↓|σ_z |↑⟩ is zero. So the cross terms vanish. Only the first and last terms remain.

So ⟨σ_z⟩ = (0.5)^2 * 1 + ( (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) * (-1) ) = 0.25 *1 + 0.75 * (-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5.

So the expectation of σ_z is -0.5. Then, when we multiply by 10, the expectation of 10σ_z is 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now, the second term is 5σ_x. So we need to find the expectation of σ_x.

Hmm. σ_x is a bit trickier. I remember that σ_x has eigenstates that are the spin states in the x-direction, like |→⟩ and |←⟩. But for σ_x, the expectation can be found using the same approach as with σ_z, but the off-diagonal terms in the matrix representation of σ_x come into play.

Wait, alternatively, the expectation value of σ_x can be found using the formula:

⟨σ_x⟩ = |a|^2 * ⟨↑|σ_x|↑⟩ + a b^* ⟨↑|σ_x|↓⟩ + a^* b ⟨↓|σ_x|↑⟩ + |b|^2 ⟨↓|σ_x|↓⟩.

Wait, but perhaps a simpler approach is to note that for a spin-1/2 particle in state ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, the expectation value of σ_x is (a b* + a* b)/(a a* + b b*). Wait, no, maybe that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps the expectation is (a b^* + a^* b) because σ_x is represented with off-diagonal terms.

Wait, perhaps I should write the matrix form. The Pauli matrix σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So for a state vector |ψ⟩ = [a; b], the expectation value ⟨σ_x⟩ is ψ† σ_x ψ.

So ψ is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. So ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

So ψ† σ_x ψ is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) ) because the matrix multiplication would give:

[0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [[0,1],[1,0]] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]

Let me compute that. The product of σ_x with ψ is [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5]. Then multiply by ψ†:

0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 + (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5 = [ (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5) ) ] = 2*(0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 ) = sqrt(3)/2.

Wait, no. Because 0.5*sqrt(3)/2 is (sqrt(3)/4), and the second term is the same, so adding them gives sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2.

So ⟨σ_x⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Let me double-check the calculation.

The matrix product σ_x |ψ⟩ is [[0,1],[1,0]] [0.5; sqrt(3)/2 ] = [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5]. Then ψ† σ_x ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] multiplied by [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5].

So that's 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5. Which is 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 = (sqrt(3))/4, and the second term is same. Adding them together gives (sqrt(3)/4 ) + (sqrt(3)/4 ) = sqrt(3)/2.

So ⟨σ_x⟩ is sqrt(3)/2, which is approximately 0.8660254.

Wait, but wait, does that make sense? Because if the state is more in the |↓⟩ direction, perhaps the expectation of σ_x is positive or negative? Let me think. The state is a|↑> + b|↓> with a = 0.5 and b = sqrt(3)/2. Since a is positive and b is positive, the state is in the first quadrant. So the expectation of σ_x (which measures the spin in the x-direction) should be positive. So the result we got, sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866, is positive, which makes sense.

So putting it all together, the expectation value of 10σ_z +5σ_x is 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2) = -5 + (5*sqrt(3)/2).

Wait, let me compute that numerically. Let's calculate each part:

10σ_z expectation is 10*(-0.5) = -5.

5σ_x expectation is 5*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈5*(0.8660) ≈4.3301.

So total expectation is -5 +4.3301 = -0.6699.

Wait, so approximately -0.67.

Looking at the options, option C is -0.7. Hmm. Let me check if I did the calculation correctly.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me recheck the calculations.

Let me compute 5*(sqrt(3)/2):

sqrt(3) is approximately 1.73205.

So sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866025.

Multiply by 5: 5 * 0.866025 ≈4.330125.

Then, 10σz's expectation is -5, so total expectation is 4.330125 -5 = -0.669875. Rounded to one decimal place, that would be -0.7, right? Because -0.6698 is closer to -0.7 than -0.6, as 0.6698 is more than 0.665, which is the midpoint between 0.6 and 0.7.

Wait no, wait: when rounding to one decimal place, if the next digit is 5 or higher, we round up. So 0.6698 is 0.67 when rounded to two decimals, but to one decimal, the second digit is 6, which is >=5, so 0.7.

Wait, but wait: 0.6698 is 0.67 when rounded to two decimal places, but when rounding to one decimal place, we look at the second decimal place, which is 6. So 0.6698 → 0.7 when rounded to one decimal place.

Wait, no. Wait, for example, 0.6698 is approximately 0.67 when rounded to two decimals, but when rounding to one decimal, it's 0.7 because the next digit is 6, which is more than 5, so we round up.

Wait, but wait: 0.6698 is 0.6 (one decimal) and 0.0698 as the next digits. So the first digit after decimal is 6, so wait, let me think. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, when the number is 0.6698, rounded to one decimal place, we look at the second decimal digit, which is 6. Since 6 >=5, we round up the first decimal digit, which is 6 →7. So yes, 0.6698 rounded to one decimal is 0.7.

So the expectation value is approximately -0.7, which matches option C.

Wait, but let me check the calculation again. Because sometimes I might make a mistake.

Let me re-calculate:

⟨10σ_z +5σ_x⟩ = 10⟨σ_z⟩ +5⟨σ_x⟩.

We found ⟨σ_z⟩ = -0.5.

⟨σ_x⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660.

So 5 * 0.8660 =4.330.

10 * (-0.5) = -5.0.

So sum is 4.330 -5 = -0.670.

Rounded to one decimal place, that's -0.7.

So the correct answer should be C) -0.7.

To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value of an operator \( O \) is given by \( \langle O \rangle = \langle \psi | O | \psi \rangle \). Breaking this into two parts:

### 1. Expectation value of \( \sigma_z \)
The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) correspond to eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \) for \( \sigma_z \), respectively. For the state \( \psi = a|\uparrow\rangle + b|\downarrow\rangle \), the expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = |a|^2(1) + |b|^2(-1).
\]
Here, \( a = 0.5 \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \). Thus:
\[
|a|^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25, \quad |b|^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 0.75.
\]
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 0.25(1) + 0.75(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]

### 2. Expectation value of \( \sigma_x \)
The Pauli matrix \( \sigma_x \) is represented as:
\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
For the state \( \psi = a|\uparrow\rangle + b|\downarrow\rangle \), the expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle = a b^* + a^* b.
\]
Substituting \( a = 0.5 \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \):
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = (0.5)(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}) + (0.5)(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]
Approximating \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \), we find:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle \approx \frac{1.732}{2} \approx 0.866.
\]

### 3. Combining results
The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]
Substituting \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle = -0.5 \) and \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \approx 0.866 \):
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10(-0.5) + 5(0.866) = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]
Rounding to one decimal place, the expectation value is \( -0.7 \).

### Final Answer
The correct option is **C) -0.7**.

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the problem is about.

The question is about a spin-half particle in a specific superposition state. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. I remember that |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of the σ_z operator. The problem asks for the expectation value of the operator 10σ_z +5σ_x. I need to find this expectation value and choose the correct option from the given choices.

Hmm. So expectation values. I think the expectation value of an operator is found by taking the inner product of the state with the operator acting on the state. Right, the expectation value ⟨O⟩ is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩.

Okay, so the operator here is 10σ_z +5σ_x. Maybe I can break this into two parts: compute the expectation of each term separately and then combine them.

First, let's write down the state vector. The state ψ is 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let me note that sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866, just for a sanity check that the coefficients make sense. The sum of the squares should be 1, right? Let's see: (0.5)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 0.25 + (3/4) = 1. Yep, that's correct.

Now, σ_z has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ respectively. Because |↑⟩ is an eigenstate, the expectation of σ_z is just the coefficient squared times the eigenvalue. Wait, no. Wait, the expectation value of σ_z for ψ is the sum of the probabilities times their respective eigenvalues.

Wait, more accurately, for any state a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, the expectation of σ_z is |a|^2 - |b|^2? Or is it |a|^2*(+1) + |b|^2*(-1). Yes, because |↑⟩ corresponds to eigenvalue +1, |↓⟩ to -1. So σ_z |↑⟩ = +|↑⟩, σ_z |↓⟩ = -|↓⟩.

So for our state, a is 0.5, b is sqrt(3)/2. So |a|^2 is (0.5)^2 = 0.25, and |b|^2 is (3/4) = 0.75. So ⟨σ_z⟩ = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, another way to compute the expectation is to compute the inner product. Let me think. The state is 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. So the bra is 0.5⟨↑| + (sqrt(3)/2)⟨↓|.

So ⟨ψ|σ_z |ψ⟩ would be (0.5⟨↑| + (sqrt(3)/2)⟨↓|) σ_z (0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩ ).

Multiplying this out: 0.5 * 0.5 ⟨↑|σ_z |↑⟩ + 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) ⟨↑|σ_z |↓⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 ⟨↓|σ_z |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)*(sqrt(3)/2) ⟨↓|σ_z |↓⟩.

But σ_z |↑⟩ = |↑⟩, σ_z |↓⟩ = -|↓⟩. So the cross terms would have ⟨↑| -|↓⟩ and ⟨↓| +|↑⟩. Wait, but ⟨↑|σ_z |↓⟩ = ⟨↑| (-|↓⟩) ) = 0 because |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are orthogonal. Similarly, ⟨↓|σ_z |↑⟩ is zero. So the cross terms vanish. Only the first and last terms remain.

So ⟨σ_z⟩ = (0.5)^2 * 1 + ( (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) * (-1) ) = 0.25 *1 + 0.75 * (-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5.

So the expectation of σ_z is -0.5. Then, when we multiply by 10, the expectation of 10σ_z is 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now, the second term is 5σ_x. So we need to find the expectation of σ_x.

Hmm. σ_x is a bit trickier. I remember that σ_x has eigenstates that are the spin states in the x-direction, like |→⟩ and |←⟩. But for σ_x, the expectation can be found using the same approach as with σ_z, but the off-diagonal terms in the matrix representation of σ_x come into play.

Wait, alternatively, the expectation value of σ_x can be found using the formula:

⟨σ_x⟩ = |a|^2 * ⟨↑|σ_x|↑⟩ + a b^* ⟨↑|σ_x|↓⟩ + a^* b ⟨↓|σ_x|↑⟩ + |b|^2 ⟨↓|σ_x|↓⟩.

Wait, but perhaps a simpler approach is to note that for a spin-1/2 particle in state ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, the expectation value of σ_x is (a b* + a* b)/(a a* + b b*). Wait, no, maybe that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps the expectation is (a b^* + a^* b) because σ_x is represented with off-diagonal terms.

Wait, perhaps I should write the matrix form. The Pauli matrix σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So for a state vector |ψ⟩ = [a; b], the expectation value ⟨σ_x⟩ is ψ† σ_x ψ.

So ψ is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. So ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

So ψ† σ_x ψ is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) ) because the matrix multiplication would give:

[0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [[0,1],[1,0]] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]

Let me compute that. The product of σ_x with ψ is [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5]. Then multiply by ψ†:

0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 + (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5 = [ (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5) ) ] = 2*(0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 ) = sqrt(3)/2.

Wait, no. Because 0.5*sqrt(3)/2 is (sqrt(3)/4), and the second term is the same, so adding them gives sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2.

So ⟨σ_x⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Let me double-check the calculation.

The matrix product σ_x |ψ⟩ is [[0,1],[1,0]] [0.5; sqrt(3)/2 ] = [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5]. Then ψ† σ_x ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] multiplied by [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5].

So that's 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5. Which is 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 = (sqrt(3))/4, and the second term is same. Adding them together gives (sqrt(3)/4 ) + (sqrt(3)/4 ) = sqrt(3)/2.

So ⟨σ_x⟩ is sqrt(3)/2, which is approximately 0.8660254.

Wait, but wait, does that make sense? Because if the state is more in the |↓⟩ direction, perhaps the expectation of σ_x is positive or negative? Let me think. The state is a|↑> + b|↓> with a = 0.5 and b = sqrt(3)/2. Since a is positive and b is positive, the state is in the first quadrant. So the expectation of σ_x (which measures the spin in the x-direction) should be positive. So the result we got, sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866, is positive, which makes sense.

So putting it all together, the expectation value of 10σ_z +5σ_x is 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2) = -5 + (5*sqrt(3)/2).

Wait, let me compute that numerically. Let's calculate each part:

10σ_z expectation is 10*(-0.5) = -5.

5σ_x expectation is 5*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈5*(0.8660) ≈4.3301.

So total expectation is -5 +4.3301 = -0.6699.

Wait, so approximately -0.67.

Looking at the options, option C is -0.7. Hmm. Let me check if I did the calculation correctly.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me recheck the calculations.

Let me compute 5*(sqrt(3)/2):

sqrt(3) is approximately 1.73205.

So sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866025.

Multiply by 5: 5 * 0.866025 ≈4.330125.

Then, 10σz's expectation is -5, so total expectation is 4.330125 -5 = -0.669875. Rounded to one decimal place, that would be -0.7, right? Because -0.6698 is closer to -0.7 than -0.6, as 0.6698 is more than 0.665, which is the midpoint between 0.6 and 0.7.

Wait no, wait: when rounding to one decimal place, if the next digit is 5 or higher, we round up. So 0.6698 is 0.67 when rounded to two decimals, but to one decimal, the second digit is 6, which is >=5, so 0.7.

Wait, but wait: 0.6698 is 0.67 when rounded to two decimal places, but when rounding to one decimal place, we look at the second decimal place, which is 6. So 0.6698 → 0.7 when rounded to one decimal place.

Wait, no. Wait, for example, 0.6698 is approximately 0.67 when rounded to two decimals, but when rounding to one decimal, it's 0.7 because the next digit is 6, which is more than 5, so we round up.

Wait, but wait: 0.6698 is 0.6 (one decimal) and 0.0698 as the next digits. So the first digit after decimal is 6, so wait, let me think. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, when the number is 0.6698, rounded to one decimal place, we look at the second decimal digit, which is 6. Since 6 >=5, we round up the first decimal digit, which is 6 →7. So yes, 0.6698 rounded to one decimal is 0.7.

So the expectation value is approximately -0.7, which matches option C.

Wait, but let me check the calculation again. Because sometimes I might make a mistake.

Let me re-calculate:

⟨10σ_z +5σ_x⟩ = 10⟨σ_z⟩ +5⟨σ_x⟩.

We found ⟨σ_z⟩ = -0.5.

⟨σ_x⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660.

So 5 * 0.8660 =4.330.

10 * (-0.5) = -5.0.

So sum is 4.330 -5 = -0.670.

Rounded to one decimal place, that's -0.7.

So the correct answer should be C) -0.7.


To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value of an operator \( O \) is given by \( \langle O \rangle = \langle \psi | O | \psi \rangle \). Breaking this into two parts:

### 1. Expectation value of \( \sigma_z \)
The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) correspond to eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \) for \( \sigma_z \), respectively. For the state \( \psi = a|\uparrow\rangle + b|\downarrow\rangle \), the expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = |a|^2(1) + |b|^2(-1).
\]
Here, \( a = 0.5 \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \). Thus:
\[
|a|^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25, \quad |b|^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 0.75.
\]
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 0.25(1) + 0.75(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]

### 2. Expectation value of \( \sigma_x \)
The Pauli matrix \( \sigma_x \) is represented as:
\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
For the state \( \psi = a|\uparrow\rangle + b|\downarrow\rangle \), the expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle = a b^* + a^* b.
\]
Substituting \( a = 0.5 \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \):
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = (0.5)(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}) + (0.5)(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]
Approximating \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \), we find:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle \approx \frac{1.732}{2} \approx 0.866.
\]

### 3. Combining results
The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]
Substituting \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle = -0.5 \) and \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \approx 0.866 \):
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10(-0.5) + 5(0.866) = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]
Rounding to one decimal place, the expectation value is \( -0.7 \).

### Final Answer
The correct option is **C) -0.7**.

Answer: C
