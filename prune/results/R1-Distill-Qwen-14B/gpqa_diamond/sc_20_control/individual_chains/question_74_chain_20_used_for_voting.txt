Okay, so I've got this problem about radioactive decay, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that we have an atom which has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. Now, 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed yet. They're asking what the probability is that it will decay in the next 150 minutes.

Wait, wait a second. The next 150 minutes—does that mean 150 minutes from when we started monitoring, or from the current time? Because 50 minutes have already passed, so the next 150 would take us to 200 minutes total. But I think the correct approach is to consider the remaining time after the 50 minutes have passed. Hmm.

I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model. The key idea is that the probability of decay doesn't depend on the time already elapsed. So, if the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, it doesn't affect the probability of it decaying in the subsequent time.

So the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes if we're looking at the total. But wait, because the decay probability given is for 100 minutes. So maybe I should think in terms of the decay constant.

The decay probability (which I think is the cumulative probability up to a certain time) is given as 32% for 100 minutes. Let me denote P(t) as the probability that the atom decays by time t.

So P(100) = 0.32. The formula for P(t) is 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant.

Wait, no. Wait, no, that's the survival probability S(t). Because S(t) = e^(-λt) is the probability that the atom hasn't decayed by time t. So the decay probability up to time t is 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt).

So P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt) = 0.32 when t is 100 minutes. So 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ*100). Let me solve for λ.

Rearranging, e^(-λ*100) = 0.68. Taking natural logarithm on both sides: -λ*100 = ln(0.68). So λ = - ln(0.68) / 100.

Let me calculate ln(0.68). I know that ln(1) is 0, ln(e) is 1, and ln(0.5) is about -0.693. 0.68 is a bit higher than 0.5, so ln(0.68) is around -0.385. Let me double-check that. Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let me think: ln(0.68) ≈ -0.38566. So λ ≈ 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Now, the question is about the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes. But wait, that's 150 minutes from the current time, which is after 50 minutes have passed. So the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes.

So the probability P(200) is 1 - e^(-λ*200). Let me compute that.

Wait, but another way to look at it: The probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200 is the same as the probability that it decays by 200 minus the probability it decayed by 50. Because if it hasn't decayed by 50, the probability it will decay in the next 150 is P(200) - P(50).

Wait, no. Because P(t) is the cumulative probability from the start. So the probability that it decays after time t1 but before t2 is P(t2) - P(t1).

Alternatively, if the atom hasn't decayed by 50 minutes, the conditional probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is [P(200) - P(50)] / [1 - P(50)].

Wait, that's right. The conditional probability is the probability that it decays between 50 and 200, given that it hasn't decayed by 50. So it's [P(200) - P(50)] divided by the probability that it hasn't decayed by 50, which is [1 - P(50)].

But wait, maybe I can compute it more simply using the exponential formula.

Since the decay process is memoryless, the probability that it decays in the next T minutes, given that it hasn't decayed for t minutes, is the same as the probability it decays in T minutes starting fresh. Because the exponential distribution has no memory.

So in this case, the atom hasn't decayed for 50 minutes. The remaining time to monitor is 150 minutes. So the probability it decays in that time is P'(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150).

Wait, but wait. Because the 32% is given for 100 minutes. So perhaps I should compute λ first using t=100, P=0.32.

So, as before, λ = (1/100)*ln(1/(1-0.32)) )= (ln(1/0.68))/100 ≈ (0.38566)/100 ≈ 0.0038566 min⁻¹.

Now, P(200) = 1 - e^(-λ * 200) = 1 - e^(-0.0038566 * 200).

Calculate 0.0038566 * 200 = 0.77132. So e^(-0.77132) ≈ e^(-0.77) ≈ 0.463. So P(200) is about 1 - 0.463 = 0.537 or 53.7%.

Similarly, P(50) = 1 - e^(-λ *50) = 1 - e^(-0.0038566 *50) = 1 - e^(-0.19283) ≈ 1 - 0.8253 ≈ 0.1747, or 17.47%.

So the probability that it decayed between 50 and 200 is P(200) - P(50) ≈ 53.7% - 17.5% ≈ 36.2%. But that's the absolute probability. But the question is, given that it hasn't decayed by 50, what is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes.

Wait, no, wait: because the next 150 minutes is from time 50 to 200. So the probability is P(200) - P(50) = 0.537 - 0.1747 ≈ 0.362, or 36.2%. But wait, that's not one of the options. The options given are 40%, 44%, 48%, 52%.

Hmm. So maybe I'm making a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: Since the decay is memoryless, the probability that it decays in the next T minutes is the same as the probability that it decays in T minutes regardless of the past. So T is 150 minutes. So the probability is 1 - e^(-λ*T).

But wait, the 32% is for 100 minutes. So λ is calculated based on t=100, P=0.32.

Wait, so let's compute λ again. P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ *100). So e^(-λ *100) = 0.68. So λ = (- ln(0.68))/100 ≈ (0.38566)/100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Now, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes after the current time is P = 1 - e^(-λ *150). Let's compute that.

Compute λ*150 = 0.0038566 * 150 ≈ 0.57849.

e^(-0.57849) ≈ e^-0.5785 ≈ Let me compute this: e^0.5 is about 1.6487, e^0.6 is about 1.8221. 0.5785 is between 0.5 and 0.6. Let me approximate it as 1.781. So e^-0.5785 ≈ 1/1.781 ≈ 0.561.

So 1 - 0.561 = 0.439, or about 43.9%. That's approximately 44%, which is option A.

Wait, but wait another moment. Because the problem says that we have 50 minutes passed without decay. So does that affect the calculation?

Wait, no. Because the process is memoryless. So the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as if we started monitoring now, regardless of the past. So the 50 minutes have passed and it's not decayed, but that doesn't change the probability for the next 150 minutes.

So the correct probability is approximately 44%, which is option A.

But wait, let me double-check the calculation for e^-0.5785.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let's compute 0.5785.

Using a calculator: ln(2)=0.6931, so 0.5785 is a bit less than ln(2). Let me compute e^-0.5785.

Alternatively, using a calculator approximation:

0.5785 ≈ 0.5785.

We can use the Taylor series expansion around x=0:

e^x ≈ 1 + x + x²/2 + x^3/6 + x^4/24.

But since x is negative, e^-x = 1/(e^x). Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute e^-0.5785.

Alternatively, I can note that:

ln(1.783) ≈ 0.5785. Let me check:

ln(1.783) = ?

We know that ln(1.8) is about 0.5878. So 1.783 is a little less than that. Let's see:

Compute 1.783. Let me compute ln(1.78) ≈ 0.574.

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use a calculator-like approximation.

So, e^0.5785 ≈ ?

We can write 0.5785 = 0.5 + 0.0785.

e^0.5 is about 1.64872.

Now, e^0.0785 can be approximated using the Taylor series:

e^x ≈ 1 + x + x²/2 + x^3/6.

x=0.0785.

So x = 0.0785.

1 + 0.0785 = 1.0785.

x² = 0.006162, divided by 2 is 0.003081.

x^3 = 0.0785^3 ≈ 0.000483, divided by 6 is about 0.0000805.

So adding these up: 1.0785 + 0.003081 = 1.081581, plus 0.0000805 → ~1.08166.

So e^0.5785 ≈ e^0.5 * e^0.0785 ≈ 1.64872 * 1.08166 ≈ 1.64872 * 1.08 ≈ 1.781.

So e^-0.5785 ≈ 1/1.781 ≈ 0.561.

Thus, 1 - 0.561 = 0.439, which is 43.9%, so approximately 44%, which is option A.

But wait, looking at the options, option A is 44%. So the answer should be A.

Another way: Let's compute λ again.

λ = (1/100)* ln(1 / (1-0.32)) )= (1/100) * ln(1/0.68) ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Then, for 150 minutes, the probability is 1 - e^(-0.0038566 *150) = 1 - e^(-0.57849).

Which gives us the 43.9% as before.

So the correct answer is A) 44%.

The problem involves determining the probability that a radioactive atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has not decayed in the first 50 minutes. The decay follows an exponential model, and the cumulative decay probability is given as 32% (or 0.32) over 100 minutes.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Decay Probability Formula**:  
   The cumulative decay probability up to time \( t \) is given by:  
   \[
   P(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
   \]  
   where \( \lambda \) is the decay constant.

2. **Determine \( \lambda \)**:  
   From the given data, \( P(100) = 0.32 \). Substituting into the formula:  
   \[
   0.32 = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 100}
   \]  
   Rearranging:  
   \[
   e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68
   \]  
   Taking the natural logarithm:  
   \[
   -\lambda \cdot 100 = \ln(0.68)
   \]  
   \[
   \lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100}
   \]  
   Using \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.38566 \):  
   \[
   \lambda \approx \frac{0.38566}{100} \approx 0.0038566 \, \text{min}^{-1}
   \]

3. **Probability of Decay in the Next 150 Minutes**:  
   The probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes is given by:  
   \[
   P_{\text{next 150}} = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}
   \]  
   Substituting \( \lambda \approx 0.0038566 \):  
   \[
   \lambda \cdot 150 = 0.0038566 \cdot 150 \approx 0.57849
   \]  
   \[
   e^{-0.57849} \approx 0.561
   \]  
   \[
   P_{\text{next 150}} = 1 - 0.561 \approx 0.439 \, \text{or} \, 43.9\%
   \]

4. **Memoryless Property**:  
   Since radioactive decay is memoryless, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is unaffected by the fact that 50 minutes have already passed without decay. The calculation above directly gives the required probability.

### Conclusion:
The probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately **44%**, which corresponds to option **A**.

Okay, so I've got this problem about radioactive decay, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that we have an atom which has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. Now, 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed yet. They're asking what the probability is that it will decay in the next 150 minutes.

Wait, wait a second. The next 150 minutes—does that mean 150 minutes from when we started monitoring, or from the current time?

The decay probability (which I think is the cumulative probability up to a certain time) is given as 32% for 100 minutes. Let me denote P(t) as the probability that the atom decays by time t.

So P(100) = 0.32. The formula for P(t) is 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant.

Wait, no. Wait, no, that's the survival probability S(t). Because S(t) = e^(-λt) is the probability that the atom hasn't decayed by time t. So the decay probability up to time t is 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt).

So P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt) = 0.32 when t is 100 minutes. So 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ*100). Let me solve for λ.

Rearranging, e^(-λ*100) = 0.68. Taking natural logarithm on both sides: -λ*100 = ln(0.68). So λ = - ln(0.68) / 100.

Let me calculate ln(0.68). I know that ln(1) is 0, ln(e) is 1, and ln(0.5) is about -0.693. 0.68 is a bit higher than 0.5, so ln(0.68) is around -0.385. Let me double-check that. Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let me think: ln(0.68) ≈ -0.38566. So λ ≈ 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Now, the question is about the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes. But wait, that's 150 minutes from the current time, which is after 50 minutes have passed. So the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes.

So the probability P(200) is 1 - e^(-λ*200). Let me compute that.

Wait, but another way to look at it: The probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200 is the same as the probability that it decays by 200 minus the probability it decayed by 50. Because if it hasn't decayed by 50, the probability it will decay in the next 150 is P(200) - P(50).

Wait, no. Because P(t) is the cumulative probability from the start. So the probability that it decays after time t1 but before t2 is P(t2) - P(t1).

Alternatively, if the atom hasn't decayed by 50 minutes, the conditional probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is [P(200) - P(50)] / [1 - P(50)].

Wait, that's right. The conditional probability is the probability that it decays between 50 and 200, given that it hasn't decayed by 50. So it's [P(200) - P(50)] divided by the probability that it hasn't decayed by 50, which is [1 - P(50)].

But wait, maybe I can compute it more simply using the exponential formula.

Since the decay process is memoryless, the probability that it decays in the next T minutes, given that it hasn't decayed for t minutes, is the same as the probability it decays in T minutes starting fresh. Because the exponential distribution has no memory.

So in this case, the atom hasn't decayed for 50 minutes. The remaining time to monitor is 150 minutes. So the probability it decays in that time is P'(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150).

Wait, but wait. Because the 32% is given for 100 minutes. So perhaps I should compute λ first using t=100, P=0.32.

So, as before, λ = (1/100)*ln(1/(1-0.32)) )= (ln(1/0.68))/100 ≈ (0.38566)/100 ≈ 0.0038566 min⁻¹.

Now, P(200) = 1 - e^(-λ * 200) = 1 - e^(-0.0038566 * 200).

Calculate 0.0038566 * 200 = 0.77132. So e^(-0.77132) ≈ e^(-0.77) ≈ 0.463. So P(200) is about 1 - 0.463 = 0.537 or 53.7%.

Similarly, P(50) = 1 - e^(-λ *50) = 1 - e^(-0.0038566 *50) = 1 - e^(-0.19283) ≈ 1 - 0.8253 ≈ 0.1747, or 17.47%.

So the probability that it decayed between 50 and 200 is P(200) - P(50) ≈ 53.7% - 17.5% ≈ 36.2%. But that's the absolute probability. But the question is, given that it hasn't decayed by 50, what is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes.

Wait, no, wait: because the next 150 minutes is from time 50 to 200. So the probability is P(200) - P(50) = 0.537 - 0.1747 ≈ 0.362, or 36.2%. But wait, that's not one of the options. The options given are 40%, 44%, 48%, 52%.

Hmm. So maybe I'm making a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: Since the decay is memoryless, the probability that it decays in the next T minutes is the same as the probability that it decays in T minutes regardless of the past. So T is 150 minutes. So the probability is 1 - e^(-λ*T).

But wait, the 32% is for 100 minutes. So λ is calculated based on t=100, P=0.32.

Wait, so let's compute λ again. P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ *100). So e^(-λ *100) = 0.68. So λ = (- ln(0.68))/100 ≈ (0.38566)/100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Now, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes after the current time is P = 1 - e^(-λ *150). Let's compute that.

Compute λ*150 = 0.0038566 * 150 ≈ 0.57849.

e^(-0.57849) ≈ e^-0.5785 ≈ Let me compute this: e^0.5 is about 1.6487, e^0.6 is about 1.8221. 0.5785 is between 0.5 and 0.6. Let me approximate it as 1.781. So e^-0.5785 ≈ 1/1.781 ≈ 0.561.

So 1 - 0.561 = 0.439, or about 43.9%. That's approximately 44%, which is option A.

Wait, but wait another moment. Because the problem says that we have 50 minutes passed without decay. So does that affect the calculation?

So the correct probability is approximately 44%, which is option A.

But wait, let me double-check the calculation for e^-0.5785.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let's compute 0.5785.

Using a calculator: ln(2)=0.6931, so 0.5785 is a bit less than ln(2). Let me compute e^-0.5785.

Alternatively, using a calculator approximation:

0.5785 ≈ 0.5785.

We can use the Taylor series expansion around x=0:

e^x ≈ 1 + x + x²/2 + x^3/6 + x^4/24.

But since x is negative, e^-x = 1/(e^x). Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute e^-0.5785.

Alternatively, I can note that:

ln(1.783) ≈ 0.5785. Let me check:

ln(1.783) = ?

We know that ln(1.8) is about 0.5878. So 1.783 is a little less than that. Let's see:

Compute 1.783. Let me compute ln(1.78) ≈ 0.574.

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use a calculator-like approximation.

So, e^0.5785 ≈ ?

We can write 0.5785 = 0.5 + 0.0785.

e^0.5 is about 1.64872.

Now, e^0.0785 can be approximated using the Taylor series:

e^x ≈ 1 + x + x²/2 + x^3/6.

x=0.0785.

So x = 0.0785.

1 + 0.0785 = 1.0785.

x² = 0.006162, divided by 2 is 0.003081.

x^3 = 0.0785^3 ≈ 0.000483, divided by 6 is about 0.0000805.

So adding these up: 1.0785 + 0.003081 = 1.081581, plus 0.0000805 → ~1.08166.

So e^0.5785 ≈ e^0.5 * e^0.0785 ≈ 1.64872 * 1.08166 ≈ 1.64872 * 1.08 ≈ 1.781.

So e^-0.5785 ≈ 1/1.781 ≈ 0.561.

Thus, 1 - 0.561 = 0.439, which is 43.9%, so approximately 44%, which is option A.

But wait, looking at the options, option A is 44%. So the answer should be A.

Another way: Let's compute λ again.

λ = (1/100)* ln(1 / (1-0.32)) )= (1/100) * ln(1/0.68) ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Then, for 150 minutes, the probability is 1 - e^(-0.0038566 *150) = 1 - e^(-0.57849).

Which gives us the 43.9% as before.

So the correct answer is A) 44%.


The problem involves determining the probability that a radioactive atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has not decayed in the first 50 minutes. The decay follows an exponential model, and the cumulative decay probability is given as 32% (or 0.32) over 100 minutes.

### Key Analysis:

   The cumulative decay probability up to time \( t \) is given by:  
   \[
   P(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
   \]  
   where \( \lambda \) is the decay constant.

2. **Determine \( \lambda \)**:  
   From the given data, \( P(100) = 0.32 \). Substituting into the formula:  
   \[
   0.32 = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 100}
   \]  
   Rearranging:  
   \[
   e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68
   \]  
   Taking the natural logarithm:  
   \[
   -\lambda \cdot 100 = \ln(0.68)
   \]  
   \[
   \lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100}
   \]  
   Using \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.38566 \):  
   \[
   \lambda \approx \frac{0.38566}{100} \approx 0.0038566 \, \text{min}^{-1}
   \]

3. **Probability of Decay in the Next 150 Minutes**:  
   The probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes is given by:  
   \[
   P_{\text{next 150}} = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}
   \]  
   Substituting \( \lambda \approx 0.0038566 \):  
   \[
   \lambda \cdot 150 = 0.0038566 \cdot 150 \approx 0.57849
   \]  
   \[
   e^{-0.57849} \approx 0.561
   \]  
   \[
   P_{\text{next 150}} = 1 - 0.561 \approx 0.439 \, \text{or} \, 43.9\%
   \]

4. **Memoryless Property**:  
   Since radioactive decay is memoryless, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is unaffected by the fact that 50 minutes have already passed without decay. The calculation above directly gives the required probability.
