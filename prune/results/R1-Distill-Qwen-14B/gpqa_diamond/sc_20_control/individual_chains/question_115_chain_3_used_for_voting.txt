Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out what the correct answer is. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand it properly.

Alright, so the setup is that an electron and a positron are moving along the horizontal axis. The electron is moving from the left, and the positron is moving from the right. Their Lorentz factors are given: the electron has a Lorentz factor of 4, and the positron has 2. When they collide, they annihilate and produce two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are such that one is moving in the upper-right direction and the other in the lower-right direction. I need to find the angle between these two photons' directions.

Hmm, okay. So the first thing I remember is that when a particle and its antiparticle annihilate, they produce photons. Since they're moving in opposite directions initially, their collision is head-on, so the system's momentum before annihilation is important. Also, since the photons have the same energy but move in different directions, their momenta vectors must have certain relationships.

Wait, I remember that in such annihilation processes, the total momentum before must equal the total after. So the initial momentum of the electron and positron should be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, because they're moving towards each other.

Wait, no. Wait a second. Let's think about this. The electron is moving to the right (from the left), and the positron is moving to the left (from the right), so their momenta are in opposite directions. But their masses are the same, and since they have different Lorentz factors, their momenta might not cancel each other out. Oh, wait, wait. Wait, Lorentz factor is gamma, which is greater than or equal to 1. So the momentum of each particle is gamma * m * v, but since they might have different speeds, their momenta might not cancel.

Wait, but wait. Let me correct myself. The electron and positron have the same mass, m. The electron is moving to the right (let's say positive x-direction) with Lorentz factor 4, so gamma_e =4. The positron is moving to the left (negative x-direction) with gamma_p=2.

So the momentum of the electron is p_e = gamma_e * m * v_e. Similarly, the positron's momentum is p_p = gamma_p * m * v_p. But since the positron is moving to the left, its momentum is negative. So the total initial momentum is p_e + p_p (where p_p is negative). Wait, but I'm not sure about the velocities. Do we know their actual speeds? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute their relativistic momenta using the given Lorentz factors. Because the Lorentz factor gamma is equal to E/(m c²), but also, the momentum p is gamma m v. But given that gamma is 4 for the electron and 2 for the positron, but without knowing v, maybe we can express the momenta in terms of each other.

Alternatively, since gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), maybe I can express v in terms of gamma. But that might get complicated.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The total energy before annihilation is the sum of the electron's and positron's energies. Each has energy gamma m c². So the total energy is (4 + 2) m c² = 6 m c².

After annihilation, the photons are produced. Each photon has energy E, so the total energy is 2E. Since energy must be conserved, 2E = 6 m c², so E=3 m c². So each photon has energy 3 m c². Interesting.

But wait, the problem states that the energies of both photons were measured and have the same value. So that's correct.

Now, considering momentum. The total initial momentum is the sum of the electron's and positron's momenta.

Electron: moving to the right (let's say +x), gamma_e=4. Its momentum p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e.

Similarly, the positron is moving to the left (so velocity is -v_p), so its momentum is p_p = gamma_p * m_p * v_p. Since m_e = m_p (same mass), and gamma_e=4, gamma_p=2.

But wait, gamma is a function of velocity. So for each particle, gamma is given, so I can find the velocity from gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio of their velocities. Let me think. For a particle, gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/gamma. So 1 - v²/c² = 1/gamma² → v²/c² = 1 - 1/gamma² → v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²).

So for the electron:

v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(4)^2) = c * sqrt(1 - 1/16) = c * sqrt(15/16) = c*(sqrt(15)/4) ≈ c*(3.87298/4) ≈ 0.9682c.

Similarly, for the positron:

v_p = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(2)^2) = c * sqrt(3/4) = c*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈ 0.8660c.

Wait, but the positron is moving to the left, so its velocity is -v_p.

So the momentum of the electron is p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e = 4 m c (sqrt(15)/4) )= m c sqrt(15). Wait, because v_e = c * sqrt(15)/4, so p_e = 4 * m * (c * sqrt(15)/4) )= m c sqrt(15).

Similarly, the positron's momentum is p_p = gamma_p * m_p * v_p. But since it's moving to the left, the velocity is negative. So p_p = 2 * m * (- sqrt(3)/2 c) )= - m c sqrt(3).

So total initial momentum is p_e + p_p = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Wait, but sqrt(15) is about 3.872, sqrt(3) is about 1.732. So sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) is about 2.14. So the total initial momentum is m c (about 2.14 m c). Wait, no, because m is the rest mass, so the momentum is m c * (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

But wait, wait. Let me redo that calculation. Because the positron's momentum is in the opposite direction, so p_p is -2 m v_p. Wait, positron's gamma is 2, so p_p = gamma_p * m * v_p.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the momentum vectors more accurately.

So for the electron, moving to the right, its velocity v_e is positive. So p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e = 4 m (v_e).

Similarly, positron is moving to the left, so its velocity is -v_p. So p_p = gamma_p * m_p * v_p = 2 m (-v_p) = -2 m v_p.

But I can compute v_e and v_p using gamma.

Electron: gamma_e =4. So v_e = c * sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma_e)^2)) = c * sqrt(1 - 1/16) = c * sqrt(15/16) = (sqrt(15)/4) c ≈ 0.9682 c.

Positron: gamma_p=2. So v_p = c * sqrt(1 - (1/4))= c * sqrt(3/4) = (sqrt(3)/2) c ≈ 0.8660 c.

So now, substituting into p_e and p_p:

p_e =4 m * (sqrt(15)/4 c) )= m c sqrt(15).

p_p =2 m * (sqrt(3)/2 c) )= m c sqrt(3). But since the positron is moving to the left, p_p = - m c sqrt(3).

So total initial momentum P_initial = p_e + p_p = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Wait, because the positron's momentum is negative. So p_e is positive, p_p is negative. So P_initial = (sqrt(15) m c) + (- sqrt(3) m c) )= m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Hmm, the approximate value would be sqrt(15)=3.872, sqrt(3)=1.732. So 3.872 -1.732 =2.14. So P_initial is about 2.14 m c in the positive x-direction.

Now, after annihilation, two photons are produced. Each photon has energy E=3 m c². Since energy is conserved, and each photon has the same energy, this makes sense.

Now, about the momenta of the photons. Each photon's momentum is E/c, but the direction matters. Photons move at speed c, so their momentum is a vector. So for each photon, the magnitude of momentum is E/c.

Since the photons are moving in opposite directions (upper-right and lower-right), their momentum vectors are in the right (x+) direction but with different y-components.

Wait, but the problem states that one is moving in the upper-right direction and the other in the lower-right direction. So, both are moving to the right, but one is going up, the other down.

Wait, but if both are moving to the right, their x-components of momentum are positive. So the total momentum in the x-direction after annihilation would be the sum of their x-components.

But wait, the initial momentum is in the x-direction, so the total momentum after must also be in the x-direction. Because if the initial momentum is P_initial, the final must have the same.

Wait, but the photons are moving in different directions. Let me think about that.

Wait, if both photons are moving in the same direction, like both to the right, but one upwards and the other downwards, their x-components would add, but their y-components would cancel each other out. So the total momentum in the x-direction would be 2 * (E/c) * cos(theta), but wait, each photon's direction has a certain angle.

Wait, no. Each photon's direction can be represented as having an angle theta with the x-axis. Let me denote the two photons as photon 1 and photon 2. Photon 1 is moving in the upper-right direction, so its angle is theta above the x-axis. Photon 2 is moving in the lower-right direction, so angle is theta below the x-axis.

Wait, but their directions are such that theta and (180 - theta) are possible, but in this case, since both are moving to the right, their angles are in the first and fourth quadrants, respectively. But perhaps I can model their momenta vectors as:

Photon 1: momentum vector (p_x, p_y) = (E/c cos(theta), E/c sin(theta)).

Photon 2: momentum vector (p_x, p_y) = (E/c cos(theta'), E/c sin(theta')).

Wait, but the problem said one is upper-right and the other is lower-right. So if photon 1 is upper-right, its angle theta is with the x-axis, say in the first quadrant. Photon 2 is in the lower-right, so its angle is (360 - phi) degrees, or equivalently, in the fourth quadrant, so phi would be, say, theta below the x-axis.

But the question states that the angle between the two photons is to be found. So the angle between their directions would be 180 - 2 theta, perhaps, if they are symmetric in some way.

Wait, but perhaps they are symmetric about the x-axis. Let me think about conservation of momentum.

The initial momentum is all along the x-axis. So the total momentum after must also be along the x-axis. So the sum of the y-components of the photons' momenta must be zero, and the sum of the x-components must equal the initial momentum.

So let me model this. Let the two photons have energies E each, so their momenta magnitudes are E/c each.

Let the angles of the photons with respect to the x-axis be theta and -theta. Because their directions are symmetric about the x-axis, upper-right and lower-right. So photon 1 has angle theta above x, photon 2 has angle theta below x.

Wait, but that's a possibility. Alternatively, the angles could be different, but perhaps in this case, symmetry suggests that the angles are symmetric about the x-axis.

So for photon 1, the momentum components are:

p1_x = E/c * cos(theta)
p1_y = E/c * sin(theta)

For photon 2:

p2_x = E/c * cos(theta)
p2_y = - E/c * sin(theta)

So the sum of the y-components is zero, which is necessary because the initial momentum has no y-component. So that's good.

The sum of the x-components is p1_x + p2_x = 2 * (E/c) cos(theta).

But the initial momentum is P_initial = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Wait, but let's compute E in terms of m c². Earlier, I found that each photon has energy E=3 m c², since the total energy is 2E=6 m c² (from the electron and positron, each contributing gamma m c²: 4 m c² + 2 m c²=6 m c²).

So E=3 m c². So each photon's momentum magnitude is E/c =3 m c² / c = 3 m c.

So the sum of the x-components of the photons' momenta is 2 * (3 m c) * cos(theta) =6 m c cos(theta).

This must equal the initial momentum, which is P_initial = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

So:

6 m c cos(theta) = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))

Divide both sides by m c:

6 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)

So:

cos(theta) = [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)] /6

Let me compute that:

Compute the numerator: sqrt(15)=approx 3.87298, sqrt(3)=1.73205. So 3.87298 - 1.73205=approx 2.14093.

Divide by 6: 2.14093 /6 ≈0.35682.

So cos(theta)≈0.35682.

So theta ≈ arccos(0.35682)≈69 degrees.

Wait, wait. Let me check with a calculator. Arccos(0.35682) is roughly 69 degrees. Let me compute more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it exactly.

Wait, sqrt(15) is sqrt(15), sqrt(3) is sqrt(3). So [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)]/6.

Let me compute this exactly.

Wait, let's square both sides to find if it's a known angle.

Wait, cos(theta) = [sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)]/6.

Let me compute [sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)]² = (15) + (3) - 2 * sqrt(15)*sqrt(3) )=18 - 2*sqrt(45) = 18 - 2*3*sqrt(5)=18 -6 sqrt(5).

So [sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)]² =18 -6 sqrt(5).

So [sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)]/6 squared is (18 -6 sqrt(5))/(36) = (3 - sqrt(5))/6.

So cos(theta)^2 = (3 - sqrt(5))/6.

Hmm, not a standard angle I recognize. But perhaps I can take the square root to find cos(theta):

cos(theta) = sqrt( (3 - sqrt(5))/6 )

Wait, but what's the numerical value of that?

Let me compute 3 - sqrt(5) ≈3 -2.23607=0.76393.

Divide by 6: 0.76393/6≈0.12732.

Then sqrt(0.12732)≈0.3568, which matches the earlier approximation.

So theta≈arccos(0.3568)=approx 69 degrees.

Wait, okay. So each photon is making an angle of about 69 degrees with the x-axis, one above and the other below.

So the angle between the two photons' directions would be 2*theta, since one is at +theta and the other at -theta, making the angle between them 2 theta.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, the angle between them is 180 - 2 theta, because the total angle covered from one to the other is 2 theta. Wait, perhaps. Let me visualize.

If one photon is at +theta above x, and the other at -theta below x, the angle between them is 180 - 2 theta? Or 2 theta.

Wait, no. The angle between the two vectors is the angle you would measure between their directions. So if one is at +theta and the other at -theta, the angle between them is 2 theta. Because, for example, if theta was 45 degrees, the angle between them would be 90 degrees. So in this case, with theta about 69 degrees, the angle between would be 138 degrees.

Wait, because 2 * 69 is 138. So option C is 138 degrees. But wait, let me make sure.

Wait, another approach: the photons are moving in such a way that their direction vectors are symmetric about the x-axis. So the angle between them is 2 theta. So 2*69=138 degrees.

Looking at the options, option C is 138 degrees. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculation.

Earlier, I found that P_initial is m c (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)), which is approximately 2.14 m c. Then the sum of the photons' x-components is 6 m c cos(theta). So 6 cos(theta)= sqrt(15)-sqrt(3) ≈2.14. So cos(theta)= approx 0.3568, which is about 69 degrees.

So each photon makes an angle of 69 degrees with the x-axis, one above and one below. Hence, the angle between them is 138 degrees.

So the answer should be option C) 138 degrees.

To solve the problem, we analyze the annihilation of an electron and a positron, which produces two photons with equal energy. The goal is to determine the angle between the directions of the photons.

### Key Information:
1. **Initial Setup**:
   - The electron moves to the right (positive x-direction) with a Lorentz factor of \( \gamma_e = 4 \).
   - The positron moves to the left (negative x-direction) with a Lorentz factor of \( \gamma_p = 2 \).
   - The total energy before annihilation is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron:
     \[
     E_{\text{total}} = \gamma_e m c^2 + \gamma_p m c^2 = 6 m c^2.
     \]
   - After annihilation, two photons are produced, each with energy \( E = 3 m c^2 \) (since the total energy is equally shared).

2. **Momentum Conservation**:
   - The total initial momentum is the sum of the relativistic momenta of the electron and positron:
     \[
     p_{\text{initial}} = p_e + p_p,
     \]
     where \( p_e = \gamma_e m v_e \) and \( p_p = \gamma_p m v_p \). Using the relationship \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), the velocities \( v_e \) and \( v_p \) are calculated as:
     \[
     v_e = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_e^2}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{16}} = c \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4}, \quad v_p = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_p^2}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{4}} = c \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
     \]
     Substituting these into the momentum expressions:
     \[
     p_e = \gamma_e m v_e = 4m \cdot c \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4} = m c \sqrt{15}, \quad p_p = \gamma_p m v_p = 2m \cdot c \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = m c \sqrt{3}.
     \]
     Since the positron moves to the left, its momentum is negative:
     \[
     p_{\text{initial}} = p_e + p_p = m c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}).
     \]

3. **Photon Momentum**:
   - After annihilation, the photons have equal energy \( E = 3 m c^2 \), and their momenta magnitudes are \( p = \frac{E}{c} = \frac{3 m c^2}{c} = 3 m c \).
   - Let the angles of the photons with respect to the x-axis be \( \theta \) (upper-right) and \( -\theta \) (lower-right). The x-components of their momenta are:
     \[
     p_{1x} = p \cos\theta, \quad p_{2x} = p \cos(-\theta) = p \cos\theta.
     \]
     The total x-momentum after annihilation is:
     \[
     p_{\text{final},x} = p_{1x} + p_{2x} = 2 p \cos\theta.
     \]
     By conservation of momentum, this must equal the initial momentum:
     \[
     2 p \cos\theta = m c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}).
     \]
     Substituting \( p = 3 m c \):
     \[
     2 (3 m c) \cos\theta = m c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}).
     \]
     Dividing through by \( m c \):
     \[
     6 \cos\theta = \sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}.
     \]
     Solving for \( \cos\theta \):
     \[
     \cos\theta = \frac{\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}}{6}.
     \]

4. **Angle Calculation**:
   - Using a calculator, \( \sqrt{15} \approx 3.872 \) and \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \), so:
     \[
     \cos\theta = \frac{3.872 - 1.732}{6} = \frac{2.14}{6} \approx 0.3567.
     \]
     Taking the arccosine:
     \[
     \theta \approx \arccos(0.3567) \approx 69^\circ.
     \]
   - The angle between the two photons is \( 2\theta \), as one photon is at \( +\theta \) and the other at \( -\theta \). Thus:
     \[
     \text{Angle between photons} = 2 \times 69^\circ = 138^\circ.
     \]

### Final Answer:
The angle between the directions of the photons is **138 degrees**.
