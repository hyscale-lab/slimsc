Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let me try to think it through.

First, the metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, okay, that looks kind of familiar. I remember that metrics often describe the geometry of a space, so this must be some kind of two-dimensional space since there are dx and dy terms.

Wait, pseudosphere... Oh right, a pseudosphere is a type of surface in geometry. But in the context of general relativity, I think a pseudosphere might be a two-dimensional surface with constant negative curvature. Or wait, maybe it's a different kind of manifold. Alternatively, I've heard that the metric for a pseudosphere can resemble that of a hyperbolic space.

But wait, the question says the pseudosphere has radius r=2. So maybe it's similar to how a regular sphere has a radius, but the pseudosphere's radius would relate to its curvature.

The metric given here seems to have a denominator (4 - x² - y²), which reminds me of the metric for a sphere. Because for a sphere of radius a, the metric in isometric coordinates is often something like (a^2)/(a^2 - r^2) dr² + r² dθ² or something like that. Wait, maybe this is similar but in 2D?

Wait, in 2D, the metric for a sphere can be written in polar coordinates. Let me think. In polar coordinates (r, θ), the metric is dr² + r² dθ². But when you have a sphere embedded in 3D, the metric in isometric coordinates (like for the sphere's surface) would involve scaling factors.

Alternatively, I recall that for hyperbolic space, the metric can look similar but with a negative curvature. For example, the metric might have a term like (dr² + r² dθ²)/(1 - (r²/k²)), something like that, where k is the curvature radius.

Wait, in this case, the given metric is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Let me see: If I think of this as a two-dimensional metric, it's conformally flat because it's written as a scalar multiple of the flat metric (dx² + dy²). So the line element is ds² = f(x,y)^2 (dx² + dy²), where f is that scalar function.

So the area element in such a metric would be dA = f(x,y) dx dy. Because for a conformally flat metric, the area element is just the determinant of the metric's square root, which is f^2, so sqrt(det) is f, so dA = f dx dy.

So the area would be the integral over the region where the metric is defined of f(x,y) dx dy. But wait, the denominator is (4 - x² - y²). So the function f is 32 / (4 - x² - y²). But wait, the denominator must not be zero, so x² + y² < 4. So the domain is the disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane. Because 4 is 2 squared.

So the area would be the integral over x² + y² < 4 of (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy.

Hmm, integrating that. Let me change to polar coordinates for easier integration. Since x² + y² = r², and the domain is r from 0 to 2.

So the integral becomes ∫ (from r=0 to 2) ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Wait, the integrand after substitution is (32/(4 - r²)) multiplied by r (from the Jacobian when changing to polar coordinates). So the integral is:

32 ∫ (0 to 2π) dθ ∫ (0 to 2) [r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Let me compute the inner integral first, the radial part. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → - (du)/2 = r dr.

So when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So the integral ∫ (from 0 to 2) [r/(4 - r²)] dr becomes ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) [ (r dr) / u ].

But wait, r dr is (-du/2). So substituting:

∫ (4 to 0) [ (-du/2) ) / u ] = (1/2) ∫ (0 to 4) (1/u) du.

Which is (1/2)(ln u) evaluated from 0 to 4. Wait, but ln(0) is negative infinity. Oh wait, that can't be right. Because when r approaches 2, u approaches 0, so the denominator goes to zero, and the integrand becomes large. So this suggests that the integral might diverge. But that would imply the area is infinite.

Wait, but wait. Let me check:

Wait, the metric has a denominator (4 - x² - y^2). So when x² + y² approaches 4, the denominator approaches zero, making f very large. That means the area element becomes infinite as you approach the boundary of the disk. So the area might be infinite.

Wait, but wait again. Or is there a maximum radius beyond which the metric breaks down? Because the denominator can't be zero, the maximum possible x² + y^2 is 4. So the domain is a disk of radius 2. But the function f(x,y) = 32/(4 - x² - y²) increases as you approach the boundary. So when you integrate f over the area, you're integrating a function that becomes unbounded at the edge of the domain.

Let me think about the integral ∫∫ [32/(4 - r²)] r dr dθ. The integral over θ is from 0 to 2π, which is 2π. So the area integral becomes 32 * 2π ∫ (0 to 2) [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr.

Let me compute that integral:

∫ [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr from 0 to 2.

Let u = 4 - r² → du = -2r dr → r dr = - du/2.

So,

∫ [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr = ∫ [ (r dr) / (4 - r²) ] = ∫ ( - du/(2u) ) = (-1/2) ∫ (1/u) du = (-1/2) ln|u| + C.

Evaluated from r=0 to r=2.

At r=2, u = 4 - (2)^2 = 0 → ln(0) is -infty. So,

At r=2: (-1/2) ln(0) → (-1/2)(-infty) → +infty.

At r=0: (-1/2) ln(4) → finite.

So the integral from 0 to 2 is [ +infty - (finite) ] → +infty.

So the area integral is 32 * 2π * (integral) → infinite.

Wait, but the question is about the area of the pseudosphere. Oh wait, perhaps I'm confusing the space described by the metric. Because the metric given is for a two-dimensional space, but perhaps it's embedded in a higher-dimensional space, like a pseudosphere in 3D.

Wait, or maybe the question is about the area of the surface described by this metric, which is a 2D surface. But the metric I have is for a 2D manifold. So the area of the entire space would be the integral of the area element over its domain.

But in this case, the integral diverges because as r approaches 2, the integrand becomes infinite. So the area would be infinite. So the answer would be option D) +infty.

But wait, looking at the options, option D is "+infty". So the area is infinite.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric describes a pseudosphere of radius 2, which in some models has finite area. But I'm probably mixing up different models of the pseudosphere.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the metric is that of a sphere with radius 2, but with a negative curvature, making it a pseudosphere, but regardless, the area would be finite.

Wait, no. Wait, for a regular sphere, the area is 4πr². But for a pseudosphere, perhaps it's a hyperbolic space, which has infinite area. Because hyperbolic space extends infinitely, so its area is infinite.

So perhaps the area is infinite, which would make the answer D.

Wait, but pseudosphere in geometry is a surface of constant negative curvature, but as a two-dimensional surface, it's topologically like a plane, so its area would be infinite. So if this metric represents a pseudosphere, then the area would be infinite.

So, looking back at the options, D is +infty.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating the integral. Let me double-check. The function f(x,y) = 32/(4 - x² - y²). The domain is x² + y² <4. So when I integrate f over this domain, which is a finite area, but f becomes large near the boundary.

But the integral ∫∫ f dx dy = ∫∫ [32/(4 - r²)] r dr dθ.

Which is 32 * 2π ∫ (r=0 to 2) [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr.

We found that the integral ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2 is divergent, so the area would be infinite.

So the area of the pseudosphere is infinite. So the answer is D) +infty.

The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a two-dimensional space. This metric is conformally flat, meaning the area element is given by \( dA = f(x, y) \, dx \, dy \), where \( f(x, y) = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \). The domain of the metric is restricted to \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), as the denominator \( 4 - x^2 - y^2 \) must remain non-zero.

To compute the total area, we integrate \( f(x, y) \) over the domain \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \). Switching to polar coordinates \( (r, \theta) \), where \( x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \), the area integral becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral \( \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta \) evaluates to \( 2\pi \), leaving:

\[
A = 32 \cdot 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To evaluate the radial integral \( \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \), let \( u = 4 - r^2 \), so \( du = -2r \, dr \). Substituting, the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = \frac{1}{2} \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \( \int \frac{1}{u} \, du \) is \( \ln|u| \), so:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \ln u \right]_0^4 = \frac{1}{2} \left( \ln 4 - \ln 0 \right).
\]

As \( \ln 0 \to -\infty \), the integral diverges to \( +\infty \). This indicates that the area of the space described by the metric is infinite. 

Since the metric represents a pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \), and pseudospheres in hyperbolic geometry have infinite area, the total area is indeed infinite.
