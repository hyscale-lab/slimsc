Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read through the question carefully and break it down.

The question is about binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. There are five of them. So, Y must be some element that forms five different binary fluorides. Hmm, elements that form multiple fluorides... Maybe something like sulfur, which forms SF6, or chlorine with various F counts? Or maybe it's something like oxygen, but wait, oxygen doesn't form multiple fluorides. Let me think. Oh, perhaps phosphorous? No, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe Y is oxygen, but that doesn't seem to fit with some parts of the question.

Wait, let's look at the rest of the problem to see if we can get more clues.

Substance A1 is bright red and decomposes at 293 K (which is about room temperature) into A2 and fluorine. The oF (I think that's the oxidation state of fluorine?) is 31.96%. Wait, oF probably refers to the oxidation state. Fluorine usually has a -1 oxidation state, but sometimes it can be in positive states. So, if A2 has an oxidation state of F as +31.96%, that doesn't make sense because fluorine can't have fractional oxidation states. Oh wait, maybe oF is the percentage of fluorine by mass in A2? Or perhaps it's the oxidation state in terms of percentage composition.

Wait, let's clarify. Oh, maybe oF is the oxidation state, but the percentage might be the mass percentage. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps it's the oxidation state of Y. Wait, the formula says "ɷF=31,96%", but that's probably a typo. Maybe it's ω, which is commonly used for oxidation state. So, maybe the oxidation state of F in A2 is +3 or something? But wait, fluorine usually is -1. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here.

A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is a noble gas, so if A1 is an oxidizing agent, it must be a strong oxidizing agent. Fluorine is a strong oxidizing agent, so maybe A1 is a compound that includes F and Y, perhaps a high oxidation state fluoride.

A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorination of Y. So, A3 is probably the most common fluoride of Y. For example, if Y is chlorine, A3 might be ClF or ClF3? Wait, but then A1 and A3 would be different.

Adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless concentrated solution of A4 gives A5. Then, A5 decomposes in water into two substances. That sounds like a typical acid-base reaction, perhaps. For example, if A4 is H2O, but that's not a binary fluoride. Or maybe A4 is something like HFO (but that's not a thing). Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of a fluoride salt, and adding Y (in a 1:1 ratio) gives a different fluoride.

Wait, let's think of the decomposition of A5. Upon adding Y, A5 is formed, which in water breaks into two substances. Maybe it's a metal fluoride reacting with an acid. For example, if A5 is a salt that breaks into metal and acid when water is added. Or perhaps it's a hydrolysis reaction.

Let me try to think about the elements. Since there are five binary fluorides, Y must form five different compounds with F. Let's list elements that form multiple fluorides. Chlorine forms ClF, ClF3, ClF5, but that's only three. Wait, no, Cl has ClF, ClF3, ClF5, but maybe some others? Alternatively, maybe Y is oxygen. But oxygen's fluorides are OF2 and OF, but that's only two. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps Y is sulfur. Let me see: sulfur forms SF2, SF4, SF6, maybe some others? Or phosphorus forms PF3, PF5, etc. Let me think: phosphorus has PF3 and PF5. That's two. Hmm. Not enough.

Wait, perhaps Y is nitrogen. Does nitrogen have multiple fluorides? Like NF3, maybe others? I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe Y is selenium. Or maybe it's carbon? No, carbon forms only a few.

Wait, another approach: the decomposition of A1 into A2 and fluorine. Let me imagine that A1 could be a higher fluoride, which on decomposition gives a lower fluoride and F2. For example, if A1 is YF5, perhaps it decomposes into YF3 and F2. So, A2 would be YF3, with fluorine at -1 oxidation state. So, in A2, F is -1, so the oxidation state would be -1 per F atom.

Wait, but the question says that the oF (maybe oxidation state) is 31.96%. Hmm, that's confusing. Or perhaps it's the mass percentage. Let me calculate the mass percentage of F in YF3.

Wait, if Y is Cl, for instance. Chlorine's atomic weight is about 35.5. YF3 would be ClF3. The molar mass is 35.5 + 3*19 = 35.5 +57 = 92.5 g/mol. The mass of F in that is 57 g/mol. So the percentage is (57 /92.5)*100 ≈ 61.6%. That's higher than 31.96%, so perhaps Y isn't Cl.

Another thought: maybe Y is oxygen. Suppose A2 is OF2. Then the mass percentage of F is (2*19)/(16 + 2*19) *100 = (38)/(54) *100 ≈ 70.37%. Still higher than 31.96%.

Wait, maybe Y is something with a higher atomic weight. Let's try Y as Br. Bromine's atomic weight is about 80. If A2 is BrF3. The molar mass is 80 +3(19)= 80+57=137. F's mass is 57. (57/137)*100≈41.6%. Still higher.

Hmm. Another approach: perhaps the decomposition is YF2 → Y + F2. Wait, but YF2 isn't a common compound. Alternatively, maybe it's YF3 decomposing into YF and F2. Let's compute the F mass percentage in YF.

Suppose YF is the product. Let Y be, say, Al. AlF. Al has atomic weight about 27. So molar mass is 27 +19=46. F is 19/46 ≈41.3%. Still higher than 31.96%.

Wait, what if Y is something with a higher atomic weight, like iodine. If Y is I, then A2 could be IF. The molar mass is 127 +19=146. F is 19/146≈13%. That's lower than 31.96%. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, maybe A2 is YF2. Let's compute F's mass percentage in YF2. If Y is, say, Ca, which is 40. So YF2 would be CaF2. The molar mass is 40 + 2*19=78. F is 38/78≈48.7%. Still higher than 31.96%.

Wait, perhaps Y is a transition metal with a higher atomic weight. Let me think of Y as, say, lead. No, lead's fluorides are not common. Alternatively, maybe Y is tin.

Wait, another angle: the decomposition of A1 into A2 and F2 gas. So A1 might be a fluoride that releases F2 upon heating. For example, the decomposition of ClF3: 4ClF3 → Cl2 + 6F2? Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps ClF5 decomposes into ClF3 and F2. Let me think: ClF5 → ClF3 + F2. What's the fluorine percentage in ClF3? Let's compute.

ClF3: Cl is 35.5, F is 19 each. Molar mass =35.5+57=92.5. F mass is 57/92.5= ~61.6%. Again, higher than 31.96%.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe the decomposition isn't of a high fluoride into a lower one and F2. What if A1 is a compound where fluorine is in a higher oxidation state, and upon decomposition, it goes to a lower state, releasing F2.

Wait, fluorine's oxidation states: it can be -1 (most common), +1, +3, +5, +7. So in which compounds does fluorine have a higher oxidation state? For example, in OF2, F is +2 (since O is -2). Wait, no, in OF2, each F is +2. Because O is -2, so 2*(+2)F + (-2)O = 0. So F is +2. But that's a high oxidation state.

Wait, perhaps A1 is a compound where F is in a high oxidation state, like ClF3 or something else. Let me think about the decomposition. If A1 is ClF3, maybe it decomposes into ClF and F2. Let's see: 2ClF3 → 2ClF + 4F2? Hmm, not sure about that.

Alternatively, maybe A1 is ClF5, which on decomposition gives ClF3 and F2. Let's calculate the fluorine mass percentage in ClF3. As before, it's 61.6%, which is higher than 31.96%. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the substance A2 is YF, and the F mass percentage is 31.96%. Let's compute Y's atomic weight. Let me denote Y's atomic weight as M.

In YF, the molar mass is M + 19. The mass of F is 19/(M+19) *100 =31.96%. So,

19/(M+19) = 0.3196

Multiply both sides by (M+19):

19 = 0.3196*(M +19)

Divide both sides by 0.3196:

M +19 ≈ 19 / 0.3196 ≈ 60

So M ≈ 60 -19 =41.

So Y would have an atomic mass of about 41. Looking at the periodic table, Ga is around 69.7, Ge is about 72.6, As is 74.9, Se is 78.96, Br is 79.9, Kr is 83.8, etc. Wait, no element with atomic weight around 41. Oh wait, maybe Y is something else.

Wait, 41 is near Ga? No, Ga is around 69.7. Maybe Y is Scandium (45), but that's close to 41. Hmm, perhaps I made a calculation error.

Wait, let me re-calculate:

19/(M+19) = 0.3196

Multiply both sides by denominator:

19 =0.3196 M + 0.3196 *19

Compute 0.3196 *19: 0.3196 *20 is ~6.392, minus 0.3196 → ~6.0724.

So,

19 =0.3196 M +6.0724

Subtract 6.0724: 19-6.0724=12.9276 =0.3196 M

M=12.9276 /0.3196 ≈40.53.

So approximately 40.5. Which element is that? Scandium is about 45, so that's a bit higher. Maybe Y is titanium? No, Ti is about 47.87. Hmm, maybe it's not matching. Alternatively, perhaps the formula isn't YF but another form.

Wait, maybe A2 is YF4. Let me try that.

In YF4, the molar mass is M + 4*19 = M +76.

Fluorine mass percentage: (76)/(M+76) *100 =31.96%

So,

76/(M+76) =0.3196

Multiply both sides: 76=0.3196*(M+76)

Divide both sides by 0.3196:

M +76 ≈76/0.3196 ≈237.5 → M≈237.5-76=161.5.

So Y would have an atomic weight of ~161.5. Hmm, that's high. Let's see, elements near that: Praseodymium is ~141, Neodymium ~144, Samarium ~150, Gadolinium ~157, Dysprosium ~162. Oh, Dysprosium has an atomic weight of about 162. So Y could be Dy.

Wait, but Dy forms fluorides? I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe Y is something else.

Wait, this approach might not be correct. Let me think of another way.

The problem mentions five binary fluorides. Let me think of elements with five fluorides. For example, sulfur forms SF2, SF4, SF6, maybe others. Alternatively, perhaps Y is chlorine, which can form ClF, ClF3, ClF5. Wait, only three. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the reactions. A1 oxidizes xenon. Fluorine is a strong oxidizer, and some of its compounds are as well. For example, ClF3 is a strong oxidizing agent. So perhaps A1 is ClF3. Then, when heated, ClF3 decomposes into ClF and F2.

But earlier calculations didn't fit the fluorine mass percentage. Alternatively, perhaps Y is oxygen, but O's fluorides are limited.

Another angle: the decomposition of A1 into A2 and F2. Let's assume A1 is O2F2 (dihydrogen monofluoride oxide?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's ClF3 decomposing into ClF and F2.

Wait, another thought: perhaps A1 is YF6, a higher fluoride. Suppose Y is sulfur. Then SF6 is a known compound. If SF6 decomposes upon heating into SF4 and F2, perhaps. Let's compute the fluorine mass percentage in SF4.

SF4: S is 32.07, F is 19 each. Molar mass is 32.07 +4*19=32.07 +76=108.07 g/mol. F mass is 76/108.07 ≈70.3%. Not matching 31.96%. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps A2 is YF and the fluorine percentage is 31.96%. So, as before, Y's atomic weight is about 40.5. No element near that. Maybe Y is something else, like sodium? No, sodium's atomic weight is about 23.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me recompute YF:

19/(M +19) =0.3196 → M +19 = 19/0.3196 ≈60 → M≈41. So which element has atomic weight around 41? Scandium is 45, but that's 41. Maybe it's a typo or perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the 31.96% is for the oxidation state, which is a fractional value. But oxidation states are integers, so that can't be. So more likely, it's the mass percentage.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the element Y. Since five fluorides are possible, and the problem is about their properties, Y is likely a non-metal. Let me think of S, which has SF2, SF4, SF6, maybe others. But I'm not certain.

Another approach: A3 is obtained by fluorination of Y. So perhaps Y is a metal, and A3 is its fluoride. But if Y is a metal, its fluorides are typically MF, MF2, etc. But if Y is a non-metal, like Cl, then A3 would be ClF3 or something else.

Wait, the problem says that when Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, concentrated solution of A4, it forms A5. A5 decomposes in water to form two substances. So, perhaps A4 is a solution of a fluoride salt, and adding Y (as a solid) in 1:1 ratio gives another fluoride.

Wait, let me think of a reaction. Suppose A4 is a solution of NaF (sodium fluoride). Adding Y (say, Cl) in a 1:1 ratio might not do much. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps A4 is H2F2 (hydrogen difluoride), but that's not a common compound. Wait, hydrogen fluoride is H-F, but it's a weak acid.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is an acid, like HCl, and adding Y (Cl) would form something else. Not sure.

Wait, another thought: if A4 is a solution of a metal fluoride, adding Y (a metal) might displace it. For example, if A4 is a solution of MgF2, and Y is Ca, then adding Ca in a 1:1 molar ratio might not react. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of a metal fluoride, and adding Y (as a metal) would produce another fluoride. For example, if A4 is NaF and Y is Mg, then adding Mg would not react. Alternatively, maybe A4 is AlF3 solution and Y is Mg. But not sure.

Alternatively, maybe A4 is a solution of a fluoride salt of a metal, and adding Y (in 1:1 ratio) produces another salt. Let me think: A4 could be a solution of Y'F, and adding Y in 1:1 molar ratio produces another compound.

Wait, perhaps A4 is a solution of CaF2 (calcium fluoride). Adding Y in 1:1 ratio (say, Ca to CaF2 would be 1:2 molar ratio?), not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of a fluoride of Y, and adding Y in 1:1 ratio forms a different fluoride. For example, if Y is Cl, and A4 is KCl (which isn't a fluoride, but maybe if A4 is ClF3), then adding Cl might not change much. Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, maybe A5 is a salt that undergoes hydrolysis. For example, if A5 is NaF, which in water would dissociate into Na+ and F- ions. But that doesn't produce two substances; it just dissociates. Alternatively, if A5 is something like CaF2, which also dissociates into ions. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps A5 is a metal fluoride that reacts with water to produce HF and the metal hydroxide. For example, CaF2 + 2H2O → Ca(OH)2 + 2HF. But that's not a typical reaction. Alternatively, perhaps A5 is something like MgF2, which may not react with water, but some other metal fluorides do.

Wait, another possibility: when you add Y to a solution of A4, perhaps A4 is a solution of YF4, and adding Y gives YF2. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if Y is a metal, adding it to a solution of a higher fluoride might displace it. For instance, KCl (not a fluoride) and adding Cl (as a solid) doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps A4 is a solution of YF6. Adding Y would give YF3 or something else. But I'm not certain.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to summarize what I know:

- Five binary fluorides of Y exist.
- A1 is bright red and decomposes into A2 and F2, with A2 having 31.96% F by mass.
- A1 is a strong oxidizing agent (it oxidizes xenon).
- A3 is a fluoride of Y, obtained by fluorination.
- Adding Y in 1:1 molar ratio to A4's solution gives A5, which decomposes in water into two substances.

Wait, what if Y is chlorine? Let's see: the five fluorides would be ClF, ClF3, ClF5, maybe others. Hmm, but that's only three. Alternatively, maybe ClF7 exists? I'm not sure.

If A1 is ClF3, which is yellowish, not bright red. Alternatively, maybe ClF5 is bright red. ClF5 is a bright red liquid. That fits. So A1 is ClF5.

Then, ClF5 decomposes into A2 and F2. Let's write the decomposition reaction: 4 ClF5 → 2 ClF3 + 3 F2.

So, A2 would be ClF3. Let's compute the fluorine mass percentage in ClF3.

ClF3: Cl atomic weight ≈35.5, F is 19 each. Molar mass = 35.5 + 3*19 =35.5 +57=92.5 g/mol.

Fluorine mass percentage: (57 /92.5)*100 = ~61.6%. But the question says 31.96%. That doesn't match. Hmm.

So maybe my assumption is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the decomposition is different. Maybe ClF5 decomposes into ClF and F2.

Reaction: 2 ClF5 → 2 ClF + 5 F2.

Then, A2 would be ClF. Let's compute F%: molar mass ClF is 35.5 +19=54.5. F% is 19/54.5 *100≈34.88%. Close to 31.96%? Hmm, not exactly, but maybe close enough if considering approximate values.

Alternatively, perhaps the decomposition reaction is 4 ClF5 → ClF + 5 ClF3 + 3 F2. Not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think of another element. Let's think of Y as sulfur.

A1 is perhaps SF6, which is a gas, colorless, doesn't match the bright red part. SF4 is a yellow gas. Hmm, maybe another compound.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is oxygen. A1 could be O2F2, which is a bright red gas. Let's see, O2F2: each O is -2 oxidation state, F is +1 each. It's a diatomic molecule, O2F2 is a bright red gas.

Upon heating, O2F2 decomposes into OF2 and F2. Let's compute fluorine percentage in OF2.

OF2: O is 16, F is 19 each. Molar mass =16 +38=54 g/mol. F% is 38/54 *100≈70.37%. But the question says 31.96%, so this doesn't fit.

Hmm, another thought: maybe A1 is ClF3. ClF3 is a yellowish-green liquid. No, A1 is bright red. Hmm.

Wait, what about FCl? No, that's not a bright red. Maybe ClF itself is bright red. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A1 is F2O. But O-F compounds are not common. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think of Y as an element other than a halogen. Like, perhaps Y is carbon. Wait, carbon forms CF4, which is a gas, but not bright red. Alternatively, maybe Y is nitrogen. NF3 is a colorless gas, I think.

Another approach: the decomposition of A1 gives A2 and F2. Let's say A1 is YF5, which decomposes into YF3 and F2.

So, 2 YF5 → 2 YF3 + F2.

The fluorine mass percentage in YF3 would be 3F/(M(Y) +3*19) *100=31.96%.

So,

3*19 =57.

So,

(57) / (M +57) = 0.3196 → 57 =0.3196*(M +57)

57 /0.3196 ≈ M +57 → 178.3 ≈ M +57 → M≈121.3.

Which element has an atomic weight of about 121.3? I'll check the periodic table. Tin is about 118.71, Antimony is 121.76. So Y would be antimony (Sb).

Wait, does antimony form five binary fluorides? I'm not sure. Antimony trifluoride (SbF3), antimony pentafluoride (SbF5), maybe others. Let's see: SbF, SbF3, SbF5, perhaps SbF7? Hmm, I don't know, but maybe.

If Y is antimony (Sb), then A2 is SbF3. Let's compute F%.

Molar mass SbF3: Sb is about 121.76, F is 19 each. So 121.76 +3*19=121.76 +57=178.76 g/mol.

F mass is 57/178.76 *100 ≈31.86%. Close to 31.96%. That fits!

So Y is antimony (Sb).

Then, A1 is SbF5, which is a bright red substance. Decomposes into SbF3 (A2) and F2.

But wait, does SbF5 actually exist and decompose this way? I'm not entirely sure, but let's proceed with this assumption.

Next, A3 is obtained by fluorination of Y (Sb). So A3 is probably SbF (if that exists), but more likely SbF3, but the problem says that A3 can interact with xenon. SbF3 is a Lewis acid, might react with noble gases under certain conditions. Alternatively, perhaps it's SbF5.

Wait, the problem states that A3 can also interact with xenon. Xenon is inert, but under certain conditions, can react with strong oxidizing agents. So if A3 is a strong fluoride, it might react with Xe.

Now, when Y is added to a hot, concentrated solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio, it gives A5. A5 decomposes in water into two substances.

Assuming Y is Sb, and A4 is a solution of SbF4 (if that exists). Adding Sb in a 1:1 ratio to SbF4 solution might not react, unless it's a displacement reaction. Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of SbF3.

Wait, another approach: when Y (Sb) is added to a solution of a fluoride, perhaps it forms a different fluoride. For example, if A4 is NaF, adding Sb might not do much. Alternatively, if A4 is a solution of a metal fluoride, and Sb displaces it, forming SbF.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of a higher fluoride, and adding Sb in 1:1 molar ratio forms a lower fluoride.

Wait, perhaps A4 is a solution of SbF6. Adding Sb metal (1:1 molar ratio) would produce SbF4? Or perhaps another compound.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of PbF2, and adding Sb would not react. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of a fluoride salt of another metal. For example, adding Sb to a solution of AgF would produce Ag (metal) and SbF.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of SbF5, and adding Sb would produce SbF3 and HF? Let me think: SbF5 + Sb → 2 SbF3 + F2? Not sure about the reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of AlF3, and adding Sb (1:1) produces SbF3 and AlF. But I'm not sure about the feasibility.

Wait, the decomposition of A5 in water. Let's say A5 is SbF3. Then, in water, SbF3 would hydrolyze to form Sb(OH)3 and HF. So the two substances would be Sb(OH)3 and HF.

But if A5 is SbF4, perhaps it would decompose into SbO2 and HF, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps A5 is a salt that releases HF and another compound when water is added. For example, if A5 is CaF2, it would dissociate into Ca^2+ and F^- ions, but that doesn't produce two substances. Alternatively, if A5 is something like MgF2, which might not react with water. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: if A4 is a solution of SbF6 (hexafluorosb), adding Sb metal might reduce it to SbF3 or another fluoride. So:

SbF6 + Sb → 2 SbF3 + F2?

The molar ratio would be 1:1 between Sb and SbF6, producing 2 SbF3 and F2. So A5 would be SbF3.

Then, when A5 (SbF3) is added to water, it hydrolyzes:

SbF3 + 3 H2O → Sb(OH)3 + 3 HF.

So, the two substances would be Sb(OH)3 and HF, which are the products.

But wait, in the question, adding Y (Sb) to A4 gives A5. If A4 is SbF6, and Y is Sb, then the reaction is SbF6 + Sb → 2 SbF3 + F2. The molar ratio is 1 Sb to 1 SbF6, which is 1:1, which fits the question.

So, A4 is SbF6. What is the molar mass of SbF6?

Sb has an atomic weight of ~121.76. F is 19 each. So 121.76 +6*19 =121.76 +114=235.76 g/mol.

The options are:

A) 140-160

B) 220-240

C) 160-180

D) 110-130

So, A4 is SbF6, with molar mass 235.76, which falls into option B (220-240).

Wait, but let me double-check. The question says "indicate the range in which the molecular weight of the substance A4 falls." So A4 is SbF6, which is 121.76 + (6×19) =121.76 + 114=235.76 g/mol. So it's in the 220-240 range, which is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the molecular weight range of substance A4 based on the given reactions and properties. Here's the analysis:

1. **Key Information and Assumptions**:
   - Five binary fluorides of element Y exist.
   - A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K into A2 and fluorine gas (F₂). The fluorine mass percentage in A2 is 31.96%.
   - A1 oxidizes xenon, indicating it is a strong oxidizing agent.
   - A3 is obtained by fluorination of Y and can interact with xenon.
   - A4, when mixed with Y in a 1:1 molar ratio, forms A5. A5 decomposes in water into two substances.

2. **Identifying Element Y**:
   - The decomposition of A1 into A2 and F₂ suggests that A1 is a higher fluoride of Y, and A2 is a lower fluoride.
   - The fluorine mass percentage in A2 is 31.96%. Using this, the atomic weight of Y was calculated to be approximately 121.3, which corresponds to antimony (Sb).

3. **Substances A1, A2, and A3**:
   - A1 is identified as SbF₅ (a bright-red substance that decomposes into SbF₃ and F₂).
   - A2 is SbF₃, with a fluorine mass percentage of approximately 31.96%.
   - A3 is likely another fluoride of Sb, such as SbF₅, which can interact with xenon.

4. **Substance A4**:
   - A4 is a compound of Sb and fluorine. When Sb is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, concentrated solution of A4, A5 is formed.
   - A5 decomposes in water into two substances, likely due to hydrolysis. This suggests A4 is a higher fluoride, such as SbF₆.

5. **Molecular Weight of A4**:
   - If A4 is SbF₆, its molar mass is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Molar mass of SbF₆} = 121.76 + (6 \times 19) = 235.76 \, \text{g/mol}.
     \]
   - This value falls within the range of 220–240.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Based on the analysis, the molecular weight of A4 falls within the range of 220–240.

**Answer: B**
