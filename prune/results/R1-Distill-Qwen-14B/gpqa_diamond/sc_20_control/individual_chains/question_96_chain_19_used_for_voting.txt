Okay, so I've got this question about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, I remember from my studies that black holes have entropy, and that relates to the area of their event horizon. The question gives me the angular size of the event horizon and the distance to the galaxy, and I need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy.

First, I should probably recall the formula for the entropy of a black hole. Oh right, the entropy S is proportional to the area A of the event horizon. The formula I remember is S = (A c^3)/(4 G ħ k_B), where k_B is Boltzmann's constant. But sometimes it's written in terms of the Schwarzschild radius.

The Schwarzschild radius R_s is given by R_s = (2 G M) / c². And the area A of the event horizon is 4π R_s². So substituting that into the entropy formula, S = (4π (2 G M / c²)^2 c^3)/(4 G ħ k_B) ... Wait, wait, let me make sure. Oh, right, the 4 cancels out, so S = (π (2 G M / c²)^2 c^3)/(G ħ k_B). Simplifying that, it's (π (4 G² M²)/(c^4) * c^3 ) / (G ħ k_B) = (4 π G² M² c^-1) / (G ħ k_B). The G² in numerator and G in denominator leaves G. So S = (4 π G M² c) / (ħ k_B) ) * (π? Wait, wait, maybe I should double-check. Alternatively, another approach is to remember that S = (A c^3)/(4 G ħ k_B), and A is 4π R_s², which is 4π (2 G M / c²)^2. So putting it all together, S = (4π (4 G² M² / c^4) c^3) / (4 G ħ k_B). So 4π*4 G² M² c^3 / (4 c^4) ) = (4 π G² M² c^3 )/(4 c^4) ) → simplifies to (π G² M² )/(c ħ k_B) ) times (c^3/c^4) is 1/c. Wait, maybe I'm getting lost in the algebra. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to remember that S is proportional to (M²)/ (G ħ c) because when I expand all that, the units should work out. But maybe I should focus on the steps needed.

The problem gives me the angular size θ of the event horizon. So the idea is to find the size of the event horizon (the Schwarzschild radius), which would let me find the mass M, and then use that to find the entropy.

The angular size θ is given as 1e-17 degrees. So the formula for angular size is θ ≈ (R_s) / d, where d is the distance to the black hole. Wait, no, that's an approximation when the distance d is much larger than the size of the object, so θ (in radians) is approximately equal to the size (R) divided by the distance (d). So θ (rad) ≈ R / d.

So, θ = R_s / d. Let me write that down: R_s = d * θ. But θ is given in degrees, and I need to convert it to radians for the calculation.

Wait, I can convert θ from degrees to radians. One degree is π/180 radians. So θ (rad) = 1e-17 degrees * (π/180) ≈ 1e-17 * 0.01745 radians ≈ 1.745e-19 radians. Approximately 1.7e-19 radians.

So R_s = d * θ. But wait, d is given as 1e10 parsecs. I should convert that to meters because the units for R_s are in meters or something similar.

Wait, what's a parsec? A parsec is the distance at which one astronomical unit subtends one second of arc. 1 parsec ≈ 3.0857e16 meters. So d = 1e10 parsecs = 1e10 * 3.0857e16 m = 3.0857e26 meters.

So R_s = d * θ = 3.0857e26 m * 1.7e-19 rad. Let me compute that: 3.0857e26 * 1.7e-19 = 3.0857 * 1.7 = approx 5.245, then 10^7. So 5.245e7 meters. So R_s ≈ 5.245e7 meters.

Wait, that seems a bit small, but okay. Let's check: 1e10 parsecs is a huge distance, and θ is very small, so R_s might be large? Wait, 5.2e7 meters is 52 million meters, which is about 52,000 kilometers. Hmm, wait, but for a supermassive black hole, the Schwarzschild radius is typically much larger. For example, a million solar masses would have R_s about 3e6 km (since R_s for a solar mass is about 3 km). Wait, wait, let's compute that.

Wait, the Schwarzschild radius R_s = 2 G M / c². Let me compute R_s for a black hole of mass M. So if I solve R_s = (2 G M) / c², then M = (R_s c²)/(2 G).

So given R_s ≈5.245e7 meters, M = (5.245e7 m) * (c²) / (2 G).

c is about 3e8 m/s. c² is 9e16 m²/s².

G is 6.674e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻².

So M = (5.245e7 m) * (9e16 m²/s²) / (2 * 6.674e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻² )

Let me compute the denominator: 2 * 6.674e-11 = approx 1.3348e-10.

So M = (5.245e7 * 9e16) / 1.3348e-10.

Compute numerator: 5.245e7 *9e16 = 4.7205e24.

Divide by denominator: 4.7205e24 / 1.3348e-10 = approx 3.535e34 kg.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 3.5e34 kg is way too big. Wait, the Sun's mass is about 2e30 kg. So this would be 3.5e34 / 2e30 = 1.75e4 solar masses. Hmm, that's about 17,500 solar masses. But the question says supermassive, which are millions to billions of solar masses. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation steps. Let's do it more carefully.

R_s = 5.245e7 m. So M = (R_s * c²) / (2 G).

c² is (3e8)^2 = 9e16 m²/s².

So R_s * c² = 5.245e7 m *9e16 m²/s² = 5.245e7 *9e16 = 4.7205e24 m³/s².

Divide by (2 G): G is 6.674e-11 m³/(kg s²).

So 2 G = 1.3348e-10 m³/(kg s²).

So M = (4.7205e24) / (1.3348e-10) ) kg.

4.7205e24 / 1.3348e-10 = (4.7205 /1.3348) * 1e34.

4.7205 / 1.3348 ≈ 3.535. So M ≈3.535e34 kg.

Wait that's 3.5e34 kg. Let's convert that to solar masses. 1 solar mass is about 1.989e30 kg.

So M in solar masses is 3.5e34 / 1.989e30 ≈ 3.5e4 / 2e0 ≈ 1.75e4 solar masses. Wait, about 17,500 solar masses. Hmm, but supermassive black holes are usually millions to billions, so maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of R_s. Let me double-check the R_s calculation.

d is 1e10 parsecs, which is 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 m.

θ is 1e-17 degrees, which is 1e-17 * (pi/180) radians ≈ (3.1416/180) *1e-17 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

So R_s = d * theta = 3.086e26 m * 1.745e-19 rad = approximately 3.086e26 *1.745e-19 = let me compute that.

3.086e26 * 1.745e-19 = (3.086 *1.745) *1e7.

3.086 *1.745 ≈ 3 *1.7 is 5.1, 3.086 *1.745 ≈ let's compute it accurately:

3.086 * 1.745 = ?

Well, 3 *1.745 = 5.235.

0.086 * 1.745 ≈ 0.086 *1.7=0.1462 and 0.086 *0.045= ~0.00387. So total about 0.15.

So total is about 5.235 +0.15=5.385.

So 3.086e26 *1.745e-19 = 5.385e7 meters. So R_s ≈5.385e7 m, which is 5.385e7 meters. So about 5.4e7 m.

Wait, that's the same as before. So why is the mass so low?

Wait, maybe the formula is correct. Hmm. Let me think. Oh, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the angular size formula. Because when the distance is much larger than the object, θ ≈ R_s / d. But I think that's correct.

Wait, but maybe I should use the small angle approximation: θ (radians) ≈ (R_s) / d. So yeah, that's correct.

Hmm, but supermassive black holes have masses up to 1e9 or 1e10 solar masses. So maybe 17,000 solar masses is considered supermassive in some contexts, but perhaps I made a mistake in calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is designed to proceed without exact calculation, but using orders of magnitude.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the entropy calculation using R_s.

Wait, the entropy S is (A c^3) / (4 G ħ k_B), but A is 4 pi R_s².

So S = (4 pi R_s² c^3) / (4 G ħ k_B) ) = (pi R_s² c^3) / (G ħ k_B).

Wait, I think the correct formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B). So where A is 4 pi R_s².

So S = (4 pi R_s² c^3) / (4 ħ G k_B) ) = (pi R_s² c^3) / (ħ G k_B).

So now, let me compute S.

Given R_s is 5.385e7 meters.

So R_s squared is (5.385e7 m)^2 = (5.385)^2 = approx 29, so 29e14 m².

So R_s² ≈ 2.9e15 m²? Wait, wait, 5.385e7 is 5.385 x 1e7. Squared is (5.385)^2 = approx 29, and (1e7)^2=1e14, so 29e14 m² = 2.9e15 m².

So plugging into S: (pi * 2.9e15 m² * (3e8 m/s)^3) / ( ħ * G * k_B )

Let's compute numerator and denominator.

First, compute numerator: pi * 2.9e15 * (3e8)^3.

(3e8)^3 = 27e24 = 2.7e25 m³/s³.

So pi *2.9e15 *2.7e25 = pi * (2.9 *2.7) e(15+25) = pi *7.83e40.

Approximately 24.6e40 (since pi≈3.1416, 3.1416 *7.83≈24.6).

So numerator ≈2.46e41 (m² * m³/s³) → m^5/s³.

Denominator: ħ * G * k_B.

ħ is Planck's constant over 2pi, which is approx 1.0545718e-34 J s.

G is 6.6743e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻².

k_B is Boltzmann's constant, 1.380649e-23 J/K.

Multiply them: ħ * G * k_B = 1.0545718e-34 *6.6743e-11 *1.3806e-23.

Compute step by step:

1.0545718e-34 *6.6743e-11 = (1.05457 *6.6743) e-45.

1.05457 *6.6743 ≈ 7.02, so 7.02e-45.

Then multiply by 1.3806e-23: 7.02e-45 *1.3806e-23 = (7.02 *1.3806) e-68.

7.02 *1.38 ≈9.68, so denominator ≈9.68e-68.

So S = numerator / denominator = (2.46e41) / (9.68e-68) = (2.46 /9.68 )e(41 +68) → approx 0.254e109 → 2.54e108 J/K.

Wait, wait, that's 2.5e108 J/K. But looking at the options, the options are 1e59, 1e62, 1e65, 1e66. Hmm, that's way off.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents in the numerator and denominator.

Wait, numerator: R_s² is (5.385e7 m)^2 = 2.9e15 m².

c^3 is (3e8)^3=2.7e24 m³/s³.

So R_s² * c^3 = 2.9e15 * 2.7e24 = 7.83e39 m^5/s³.

Multiply by pi: ~24.6e39 = 2.46e40.

Denominator: ħ is 1e-34, G is 1e-11, k_B is 1e-23. So 1e-34 *1e-11 =1e-45, then *1e-23=1e-68.

So S = (2.46e40) / (1e-68) ) * (1/(other constants?)).

Wait, no: the denominator is ħ G k_B. So denominator is about 1e-34 *1e-11 *1e-23 = 1e-68.

So S = (pi *2.9e15 * (3e8)^3 ) / (ħ G k_B )

So 2.46e40 / 9.68e-68 = 2.54e107 J/K.

Wait, 107 is close to 1e107, but the options are much lower. So I must have made an error.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula for entropy. Let me think again.

Wait, the correct formula for the entropy of a black hole is S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G). Or wait, sometimes it's written as S = (A c^3)/(4 G ħ k_B) * k_B, which might change the factors.

Wait, let me recheck the formula. The entropy formula I have is S = (A c^3)/(4 G ħ k_B) * k_B ? No, wait, perhaps not. Let me get the formula right.

The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 G ħ k_B) * something? No. The formula is S = (A)/(4 l_p²) ), where l_p is the Planck length. Because Planck length l_p = sqrt( G ħ / c^3 ), so l_p² = G ħ / c^3.

So S = A/(4 l_p²) ) = (A c^3) / (4 G ħ). But A is in m², so let me compute S in terms of m².

A is 4 pi R_s² = 4 pi (2 G M / c² )^2 = (16 pi G² M²)/(c^4).

So S = (16 pi G² M²)/(c^4) * c^3/(4 G ħ) ) = (16 pi G² M² c^3 )/(4 G ħ c^4 ) ) → simplifies to (4 pi G M² )/( ħ c ) ).

So S = (4 pi G M² )/( ħ c ).

So perhaps that's a better way to compute it.

So M is 3.5e34 kg.

So compute S = (4 pi G M² )/( ħ c )

Plugging in the numbers.

4 pi ≈12.566.

G =6.674e-11 m³/kg/s².

M² = (3.5e34 kg)^2 = 1.225e69 kg².

ħ = 1.054e-34 J s.

c =3e8 m/s.

So numerator: 12.566 *6.674e-11 *1.225e69 = let's compute step by step.

First, 12.566 *6.674e-11 = 12.566 *6.674 = approx 83.8 (since 12*6.674=80.088, 0.566*6.674≈3.777; total≈83.865).

So 83.865e-11.

Multiply by 1.225e69: 83.865e-11 *1.225e69 = 83.865 *1.225e58 → 83.865 *1.225 ≈102.8, so 102.8e58 =1.028e60.

Denominator: ħ c =1.054e-34 *3e8 = 3.162e-26.

So S = (1.028e60 ) / (3.162e-26 ) = (1.028 /3.162 )e86.

1.028 /3.162≈0.325, so S≈0.325e86 =3.25e85 J/K.

Wait, that's 3.25e85, which is about 1e85. But the options are 1e62, 1e59, 1e65, 1e66.

Hmm, that's way beyond the options. I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me re-express S.

Wait, S = (4 pi G M² )/( ħ c )

So, M is 3.5e34 kg.

So M² = (3.5e34)^2 =12.25e68 =1.225e69 kg².

So numerator: 4 pi G M² =4 *3.1416 *6.674e-11 *1.225e69.

Compute 4 pi G: 4 *3.1416 *6.674e-11 = approx 4 *3.1416 =12.566; 12.566 *6.674e-11 ≈83.86e-11.

Multiply by M² (1.225e69): 83.86e-11 *1.225e69 = 83.86 *1.225 = approx 102.8e58 → 1.028e60.

Denominator: ħ c = 1.054e-34 *3e8 = 3.162e-26.

So S = 1.028e60 / 3.162e-26 = (1.028 /3.162 )e86 → approx 0.325e86=3.25e85 J/K.

Still way higher than the options provided.

Wait, maybe I messed up the initial assumption about θ. Because in my calculation, the angular size gives R_s as 5.385e7 m, but perhaps I should have used another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the event horizon area from θ and d.

Wait, the angular size formula: θ (radians) = R_s / d.

So R_s = d * theta.

But I have theta in degrees, so I need to convert that.

But let's think in terms of the area.

A = 4 pi R_s².

But R_s = d theta, so A =4 pi d^2 theta^2.

But theta is in radians. So, if I can find A in terms of d and theta, perhaps that's easier.

So A =4 pi (d theta )² =4 pi d² theta².

So S = (A c^3 )/(4 G ħ k_B ) = (4 pi d² theta² c^3 )/(4 G ħ k_B ) ) → the 4 cancels, so S = (pi d² theta² c^3 )/( G ħ k_B )

Hmm, perhaps I should compute S using this formula.

Ok, let's plug in the numbers.

d =1e10 parsecs =1e10 *3.086e16 m =3.086e26 m.

theta =1e-17 degrees. Converting to radians: 1e-17 * (pi/180) ≈1.745e-19 radians.

So theta squared is (1.745e-19 )^2 ≈3.046e-38.

So A =4 pi (d theta )^2 = 4 pi d² theta².

Wait, but in the entropy formula, I have S = (pi d² theta² c^3 )/( G ħ k_B )

So let me compute that.

pi =3.1416.

d=3.086e26 m.

theta^2=3.046e-38.

c^3=(3e8)^3=2.7e24 m³/s³.

So numerator: 3.1416 * (3.086e26)^2 *3.046e-38 *2.7e24.

Let me compute each part.

d squared: (3.086e26 m )^2 =9.523e52 m².

Multiply by theta squared: 9.523e52 *3.046e-38 = 9.523 *3.046 ≈29.04e14 (since 52 -38=14). So 2.904e15.

Multiply by c^3: 2.904e15 *2.7e24 = 2.904 *2.7 =7.84e39.

Multiply by pi: 3.1416 *7.84e39 ≈24.6e39 =2.46e40.

Denominator: G=6.674e-11, ħ=1.054e-34, k_B=1.38e-23.

So G * ħ * k_B =6.674e-11 *1.054e-34 *1.38e-23.

Compute step by step:

6.674e-11 *1.054e-34 = (6.674 *1.054 )e-45 ≈7.03e-45.

Multiply by 1.38e-23: 7.03e-45 *1.38e-23 = (7.03 *1.38 )e-68 ≈9.68e-68.

So S = (2.46e40 ) / (9.68e-68 ) ) → 2.54e107 J/K.

Hmm, same result as before. So 1e107 J/K, which is way higher than any of the options.

Wait, the options are 1e59, 1e62, 1e65, 1e66. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of R_s. Or perhaps I should approach the problem differently.

Alternative approach: perhaps I should compute the area A of the event horizon in terms of the angular size and distance, then compute entropy.

We have A =4 pi R_s².

But R_s = d * theta.

So A =4 pi (d theta )².

So A =4 pi d² theta².

So let's compute A first.

d =3.086e26 m.

theta =1.745e-19 radians.

A =4 *3.1416 * (3.086e26)^2 * (1.745e-19 )^2.

Compute each part:

3.086e26 squared is approx 9.523e52.

(1.745e-19)^2 is approx 3.046e-38.

Multiply those: 9.523e52 *3.046e-38 = 2.904e15.

Multiply by 4 pi: 4 *3.1416 *2.904e15 = 3.1416 *11.616e15 = approx 3.1416 *1.1616e16 = 3.64e16 m².

So A ≈3.64e16 m².

Wait, that's the area. Then entropy S = (A c^3 )/(4 G ħ k_B )

So compute numerator: A c^3 =3.64e16 * (3e8)^3 =3.64e16 *2.7e24 =9.828e40.

Denominator:4 G ħ k_B.

4 *6.674e-11 =2.6696e-10.

Multiply by ħ (1.054e-34 ) and k_B (1.38e-23 ) → 2.6696e-10 *1.054e-34 =2.814e-44; then multiplied by 1.38e-23 → 3.878e-67.

So S =9.828e40 /3.878e-67 = approx 2.53e107 J/K.

Same result as before. So it's 2.5e107 J/K, which is 1e107. But the options are way lower.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a factor somewhere. Wait, the formula for entropy is S = (A c^3)/(4 G ħ k_B ) * (1/(k_B)), no, wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, the formula is S = (A c^3 )/(4 G ħ k_B ) * (k_B) ?

Wait, no, let me go back to the Bekenstein-Hawking formula.

The correct formula is S = (A c^3 )/(4 G ħ k_B ) * (something? No, I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach: The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula is S = (k_B c^3 A )/(4 ħ G ), so S = (A c^3 k_B )/(4 ħ G ).

Wait, that would change the calculation. Let's see.

So S = (A c^3 k_B )/(4 ħ G )

So with A=3.64e16 m².

c^3=2.7e24 m³/s³.

k_B=1.38e-23 J/K.

So numerator: 3.64e16 *2.7e24 *1.38e-23.

Compute that: 3.64 *2.7 =9.828; 1e16 *1e24 =1e40; 1e40 *1.38e-23 =1.38e17.

So numerator: 9.828 *1.38e17 = approx 13.55e17 =1.355e18.

Denominator:4 * ħ * G =4 *1.054e-34 *6.674e-11.

Compute denominator: 4*1.054e-34 =4.216e-34.

Multiply by 6.674e-11 →4.216e-34 *6.674e-11 =2.816e-44.

So S =1.355e18 /2.816e-44 = 4.81e61 J/K.

Ah, that's about 1e62 J/K.

Wait, that's one of the options, option A is 1e62.

Wait, but earlier I thought the formula didn't have k_B, but perhaps I was wrong. Let me double-check.

The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) *k_B ?

Wait, no, the formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G ) * (k_B), or perhaps without k_B?

Wait, checking quickly. The correct formula is S = (A c³)/(4 ħ G) (in units where k_B is incorporated into the natural units). But when expressing entropy in SI units, the formula includes Boltzmann's constant.

Wait, no, the formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 G ħ) * (k_B). Or perhaps S = (A c^3 k_B)/(4 G ħ). Because when you calculate the entropy, the units must work out. Let's see: A is m², c^3 is m^3/s^3, k_B is J/K (which is m² kg / (s² K)).

So numerator: A c^3 k_B → m² * m^3/s³ * m² kg/(s² K) ) → m^7 kg/(s^5 K).

Denominator: 4 G ħ →4 (m³/kg s²) * (J s) → J is kg m²/s², so ħ is kg m²/s.

So G is m³/kg s².

So denominator: G * ħ → (m³/kg s²) * (kg m²/s) ) = m^5/(s^3).

So numerator is m^7 kg/(s^5 K), denominator is m^5/s^3 → overall (m^7 kg/(s^5 K)) / (m^5/s^3) )= m² kg/(s² K).

But entropy is in J/K, which is kg m²/(s² K). So the formula S = (A c^3 k_B)/(4 G ħ) gives kg m²/(s² K) * something?

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated. Let me just go with the calculation I did.

In the calculation, using S = (A c^3 k_B )/(4 ħ G ), I got S ≈4.8e61 J/K, which is about 1e62, so option A.

But wait, the initial calculation using the correct formula without k_B gave 1e107, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use S = (A c^3)/(4 G ħ) * (k_B) ?

Wait, let me look up the correct formula to be sure. Oh wait, I can't look things up, I have to rely on memory.

Wait, I think the correct formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G) * (k_B) ?

Wait, no, the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula as I remember is S = (A c^3)/(4 G ħ k_B) ) × k_B? Or is it without the k_B?

Wait, no, the formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G) ) multiplied by some constant. Alternatively, another approach is to use the area in Planck units.

Wait, the area A in Planck units is A/(l_p^2 ), where l_p is the Planck length, sqrt( G ħ / c^3 ).

So S = (A/(l_p^2 )) * (k_B) ?

Wait, no, the formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 G ħ) ) × (1/k_B) ?

Not sure, but perhaps I should proceed with the calculation as done earlier, which gives 4.81e61 J/K, which is option A, 1e62.

But earlier, without considering k_B in the formula, I get 1e107, which isn't an option. So perhaps the correct approach includes k_B in the denominator.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) ) * k_B?

No, that would cancel. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 G ħ) * (k_B).

Wait, let me compute that.

In that case, with A=3.64e16 m², c^3=2.7e24, k_B=1.38e-23.

So numerator: 3.64e16 *2.7e24 *1.38e-23.

3.64e16 *2.7e24 =9.828e40; 9.828e40 *1.38e-23 =1.355e18.

Denominator:4 * ħ * G =4 *1.054e-34 *6.674e-11 =4 * (6.674e-11 *1.054e-34 ) =4 *7.03e-45 =2.812e-44.

So S=1.355e18 / 2.812e-44 →4.82e61 J/K.

Which is about 1e62, so option A.

So the correct entropy is approximately 1e62 J/K.

To determine the order of magnitude of the entropy of the supermassive black hole, we use the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula:

\[
S = \frac{A c^3}{4 G \hbar k_B}
\]

where \( A \) is the area of the event horizon, \( c \) is the speed of light, \( G \) is the gravitational constant, \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant, and \( k_B \) is Boltzmann's constant. The area \( A \) is related to the Schwarzschild radius \( R_s \) by \( A = 4 \pi R_s^2 \), and \( R_s \) can be expressed in terms of the angular size \( \theta \) and the distance \( d \) as \( R_s = d \theta \) (using the small-angle approximation).

### Step 1: Convert the angular size to radians
The angular size is given as \( \theta = 10^{-17} \, \text{degrees} \). Converting to radians:
\[
\theta = 10^{-17} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \approx 1.745 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{radians}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Schwarzschild radius
The distance to the galaxy is \( d = 10^{10} \, \text{parsecs} \). Converting to meters:
\[
d = 10^{10} \times 3.086 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m} = 3.086 \times 10^{26} \, \text{m}.
\]
Using \( R_s = d \theta \):
\[
R_s = 3.086 \times 10^{26} \times 1.745 \times 10^{-19} \approx 5.385 \times 10^7 \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the area of the event horizon
The area of the event horizon is:
\[
A = 4 \pi R_s^2 = 4 \pi (5.385 \times 10^7)^2 \approx 3.64 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m}^2.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the entropy
Substitute \( A = 3.64 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m}^2 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), \( G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \, \text{kg}^{-1} \, \text{s}^{-2} \), \( \hbar = 1.054 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J} \, \text{s} \), and \( k_B = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \) into the entropy formula:
\[
S = \frac{A c^3}{4 G \hbar k_B}.
\]
First, calculate the numerator:
\[
A c^3 = 3.64 \times 10^{16} \times (3 \times 10^8)^3 = 3.64 \times 10^{16} \times 2.7 \times 10^{24} = 9.828 \times 10^{40}.
\]
Next, calculate the denominator:
\[
4 G \hbar k_B = 4 \times 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \times 1.054 \times 10^{-34} \times 1.38 \times 10^{-23}.
\]
\[
4 G \hbar k_B = 4 \times 7.03 \times 10^{-45} \times 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \approx 3.878 \times 10^{-67}.
\]
Finally, calculate \( S \):
\[
S = \frac{9.828 \times 10^{40}}{3.878 \times 10^{-67}} \approx 2.53 \times 10^{107} \, \text{J/K}.
\]

### Step 5: Adjust for the correct formula
The correct formula includes \( k_B \) in the numerator:
\[
S = \frac{A c^3 k_B}{4 G \hbar}.
\]
Recomputing with this adjustment:
\[
S = \frac{3.64 \times 10^{16} \times (3 \times 10^8)^3 \times 1.38 \times 10^{-23}}{4 \times 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \times 1.054 \times 10^{-34}}.
\]
The numerator becomes:
\[
3.64 \times 10^{16} \times 2.7 \times 10^{24} \times 1.38 \times 10^{-23} = 1.355 \times 10^{18}.
\]
The denominator becomes:
\[
4 \times 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \times 1.054 \times 10^{-34} = 2.812 \times 10^{-44}.
\]
Thus:
\[
S = \frac{1.355 \times 10^{18}}{2.812 \times 10^{-44}} \approx 4.82 \times 10^{61} \, \text{J/K}.
\]

### Final Answer
The entropy of the black hole is approximately \( 10^{62} \, \text{J/K} \), corresponding to **Option A**.

Answer: A

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this question about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, I remember from my studies that black holes have entropy, and that relates to the area of their event horizon. The question gives me the angular size of the event horizon and the distance to the galaxy, and I need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy.

First, I should probably recall the formula for the entropy of a black hole. Oh right, the entropy S is proportional to the area A of the event horizon. The formula I remember is S = (A c^3)/(4 G ħ k_B), where k_B is Boltzmann's constant. But sometimes it's written in terms of the Schwarzschild radius.

The Schwarzschild radius R_s is given by R_s = (2 G M) / c². And the area A of the event horizon is 4π R_s². So substituting that into the entropy formula, S = (4π (2 G M / c²)^2 c^3)/(4 G ħ k_B) ... Wait, wait, let me make sure. Oh, right, the 4 cancels out, so S = (π (2 G M / c²)^2 c^3)/(G ħ k_B). Simplifying that, it's (π (4 G² M²)/(c^4) * c^3 ) / (G ħ k_B) = (4 π G² M² c^-1) / (G ħ k_B). The G² in numerator and G in denominator leaves G. So S = (4 π G M² c) / (ħ k_B) ) * (π? Wait, wait, maybe I should double-check. Alternatively, another approach is to remember that S = (A c^3)/(4 G ħ k_B), and A is 4π R_s², which is 4π (2 G M / c²)^2. So putting it all together, S = (4π (4 G² M² / c^4) c^3) / (4 G ħ k_B). So 4π*4 G² M² c^3 / (4 c^4) ) = (4 π G² M² c^3 )/(4 c^4) ) → simplifies to (π G² M² )/(c ħ k_B) ) times (c^3/c^4) is 1/c. Wait, maybe I'm getting lost in the algebra. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to remember that S is proportional to (M²)/ (G ħ c) because when I expand all that, the units should work out. But maybe I should focus on the steps needed.

The problem gives me the angular size θ of the event horizon. So the idea is to find the size of the event horizon (the Schwarzschild radius), which would let me find the mass M, and then use that to find the entropy.

The angular size θ is given as 1e-17 degrees. So the formula for angular size is θ ≈ (R_s) / d, where d is the distance to the black hole. Wait, no, that's an approximation when the distance d is much larger than the size of the object, so θ (in radians) is approximately equal to the size (R) divided by the distance (d). So θ (rad) ≈ R / d.

So, θ = R_s / d. Let me write that down: R_s = d * θ. But θ is given in degrees, and I need to convert it to radians for the calculation.

Wait, I can convert θ from degrees to radians. One degree is π/180 radians. So θ (rad) = 1e-17 degrees * (π/180) ≈ 1e-17 * 0.01745 radians ≈ 1.745e-19 radians. Approximately 1.7e-19 radians.

So R_s = d * θ. But wait, d is given as 1e10 parsecs. I should convert that to meters because the units for R_s are in meters or something similar.

Wait, what's a parsec? A parsec is the distance at which one astronomical unit subtends one second of arc. 1 parsec ≈ 3.0857e16 meters. So d = 1e10 parsecs = 1e10 * 3.0857e16 m = 3.0857e26 meters.

So R_s = d * θ = 3.0857e26 m * 1.7e-19 rad. Let me compute that: 3.0857e26 * 1.7e-19 = 3.0857 * 1.7 = approx 5.245, then 10^7. So 5.245e7 meters. So R_s ≈ 5.245e7 meters.

Wait, that seems a bit small, but okay. Let's check: 1e10 parsecs is a huge distance, and θ is very small, so R_s might be large? Wait, 5.2e7 meters is 52 million meters, which is about 52,000 kilometers. Hmm, wait, but for a supermassive black hole, the Schwarzschild radius is typically much larger. For example, a million solar masses would have R_s about 3e6 km (since R_s for a solar mass is about 3 km). Wait, wait, let's compute that.

Wait, the Schwarzschild radius R_s = 2 G M / c². Let me compute R_s for a black hole of mass M. So if I solve R_s = (2 G M) / c², then M = (R_s c²)/(2 G).

So given R_s ≈5.245e7 meters, M = (5.245e7 m) * (c²) / (2 G).

c is about 3e8 m/s. c² is 9e16 m²/s².

G is 6.674e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻².

So M = (5.245e7 m) * (9e16 m²/s²) / (2 * 6.674e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻² )

Let me compute the denominator: 2 * 6.674e-11 = approx 1.3348e-10.

So M = (5.245e7 * 9e16) / 1.3348e-10.

Compute numerator: 5.245e7 *9e16 = 4.7205e24.

Divide by denominator: 4.7205e24 / 1.3348e-10 = approx 3.535e34 kg.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 3.5e34 kg is way too big. Wait, the Sun's mass is about 2e30 kg. So this would be 3.5e34 / 2e30 = 1.75e4 solar masses. Hmm, that's about 17,500 solar masses. But the question says supermassive, which are millions to billions of solar masses. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation steps. Let's do it more carefully.

R_s = 5.245e7 m. So M = (R_s * c²) / (2 G).

c² is (3e8)^2 = 9e16 m²/s².

So R_s * c² = 5.245e7 m *9e16 m²/s² = 5.245e7 *9e16 = 4.7205e24 m³/s².

Divide by (2 G): G is 6.674e-11 m³/(kg s²).

So 2 G = 1.3348e-10 m³/(kg s²).

So M = (4.7205e24) / (1.3348e-10) ) kg.

4.7205e24 / 1.3348e-10 = (4.7205 /1.3348) * 1e34.

4.7205 / 1.3348 ≈ 3.535. So M ≈3.535e34 kg.

Wait that's 3.5e34 kg. Let's convert that to solar masses. 1 solar mass is about 1.989e30 kg.

So M in solar masses is 3.5e34 / 1.989e30 ≈ 3.5e4 / 2e0 ≈ 1.75e4 solar masses. Wait, about 17,500 solar masses. Hmm, but supermassive black holes are usually millions to billions, so maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of R_s. Let me double-check the R_s calculation.

d is 1e10 parsecs, which is 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 m.

θ is 1e-17 degrees, which is 1e-17 * (pi/180) radians ≈ (3.1416/180) *1e-17 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

So R_s = d * theta = 3.086e26 m * 1.745e-19 rad = approximately 3.086e26 *1.745e-19 = let me compute that.

3.086e26 * 1.745e-19 = (3.086 *1.745) *1e7.

3.086 *1.745 ≈ 3 *1.7 is 5.1, 3.086 *1.745 ≈ let's compute it accurately:

3.086 * 1.745 = ?

Well, 3 *1.745 = 5.235.

0.086 * 1.745 ≈ 0.086 *1.7=0.1462 and 0.086 *0.045= ~0.00387. So total about 0.15.

So total is about 5.235 +0.15=5.385.

So 3.086e26 *1.745e-19 = 5.385e7 meters. So R_s ≈5.385e7 m, which is 5.385e7 meters. So about 5.4e7 m.

Wait, that's the same as before. So why is the mass so low?

Wait, maybe the formula is correct. Hmm. Let me think. Oh, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the angular size formula. Because when the distance is much larger than the object, θ ≈ R_s / d. But I think that's correct.

Wait, but maybe I should use the small angle approximation: θ (radians) ≈ (R_s) / d. So yeah, that's correct.

Hmm, but supermassive black holes have masses up to 1e9 or 1e10 solar masses. So maybe 17,000 solar masses is considered supermassive in some contexts, but perhaps I made a mistake in calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is designed to proceed without exact calculation, but using orders of magnitude.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the entropy calculation using R_s.

Wait, the entropy S is (A c^3) / (4 G ħ k_B), but A is 4 pi R_s².

So S = (4 pi R_s² c^3) / (4 G ħ k_B) ) = (pi R_s² c^3) / (G ħ k_B).

Wait, I think the correct formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B). So where A is 4 pi R_s².

So S = (4 pi R_s² c^3) / (4 ħ G k_B) ) = (pi R_s² c^3) / (ħ G k_B).

So now, let me compute S.

Given R_s is 5.385e7 meters.

So R_s squared is (5.385e7 m)^2 = (5.385)^2 = approx 29, so 29e14 m².

So R_s² ≈ 2.9e15 m²? Wait, wait, 5.385e7 is 5.385 x 1e7. Squared is (5.385)^2 = approx 29, and (1e7)^2=1e14, so 29e14 m² = 2.9e15 m².

So plugging into S: (pi * 2.9e15 m² * (3e8 m/s)^3) / ( ħ * G * k_B )

Let's compute numerator and denominator.

First, compute numerator: pi * 2.9e15 * (3e8)^3.

(3e8)^3 = 27e24 = 2.7e25 m³/s³.

So pi *2.9e15 *2.7e25 = pi * (2.9 *2.7) e(15+25) = pi *7.83e40.

Approximately 24.6e40 (since pi≈3.1416, 3.1416 *7.83≈24.6).

So numerator ≈2.46e41 (m² * m³/s³) → m^5/s³.

Denominator: ħ * G * k_B.

ħ is Planck's constant over 2pi, which is approx 1.0545718e-34 J s.

G is 6.6743e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻².

k_B is Boltzmann's constant, 1.380649e-23 J/K.

Multiply them: ħ * G * k_B = 1.0545718e-34 *6.6743e-11 *1.3806e-23.

Compute step by step:

1.0545718e-34 *6.6743e-11 = (1.05457 *6.6743) e-45.

1.05457 *6.6743 ≈ 7.02, so 7.02e-45.

Then multiply by 1.3806e-23: 7.02e-45 *1.3806e-23 = (7.02 *1.3806) e-68.

7.02 *1.38 ≈9.68, so denominator ≈9.68e-68.

So S = numerator / denominator = (2.46e41) / (9.68e-68) = (2.46 /9.68 )e(41 +68) → approx 0.254e109 → 2.54e108 J/K.

Wait, wait, that's 2.5e108 J/K. But looking at the options, the options are 1e59, 1e62, 1e65, 1e66. Hmm, that's way off.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents in the numerator and denominator.

Wait, numerator: R_s² is (5.385e7 m)^2 = 2.9e15 m².

c^3 is (3e8)^3=2.7e24 m³/s³.

So R_s² * c^3 = 2.9e15 * 2.7e24 = 7.83e39 m^5/s³.

Multiply by pi: ~24.6e39 = 2.46e40.

Denominator: ħ is 1e-34, G is 1e-11, k_B is 1e-23. So 1e-34 *1e-11 =1e-45, then *1e-23=1e-68.

So S = (2.46e40) / (1e-68) ) * (1/(other constants?)).

Wait, no: the denominator is ħ G k_B. So denominator is about 1e-34 *1e-11 *1e-23 = 1e-68.

So S = (pi *2.9e15 * (3e8)^3 ) / (ħ G k_B )

So 2.46e40 / 9.68e-68 = 2.54e107 J/K.

Wait, 107 is close to 1e107, but the options are much lower. So I must have made an error.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula for entropy. Let me think again.

Wait, the correct formula for the entropy of a black hole is S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G). Or wait, sometimes it's written as S = (A c^3)/(4 G ħ k_B) * k_B, which might change the factors.

Wait, let me recheck the formula. The entropy formula I have is S = (A c^3)/(4 G ħ k_B) * k_B ? No, wait, perhaps not. Let me get the formula right.

The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 G ħ k_B) * something? No. The formula is S = (A)/(4 l_p²) ), where l_p is the Planck length. Because Planck length l_p = sqrt( G ħ / c^3 ), so l_p² = G ħ / c^3.

So S = A/(4 l_p²) ) = (A c^3) / (4 G ħ). But A is in m², so let me compute S in terms of m².

A is 4 pi R_s² = 4 pi (2 G M / c² )^2 = (16 pi G² M²)/(c^4).

So S = (16 pi G² M²)/(c^4) * c^3/(4 G ħ) ) = (16 pi G² M² c^3 )/(4 G ħ c^4 ) ) → simplifies to (4 pi G M² )/( ħ c ) ).

So S = (4 pi G M² )/( ħ c ).

So perhaps that's a better way to compute it.

So M is 3.5e34 kg.

So compute S = (4 pi G M² )/( ħ c )

Plugging in the numbers.

4 pi ≈12.566.

G =6.674e-11 m³/kg/s².

M² = (3.5e34 kg)^2 = 1.225e69 kg².

ħ = 1.054e-34 J s.

c =3e8 m/s.

So numerator: 12.566 *6.674e-11 *1.225e69 = let's compute step by step.

First, 12.566 *6.674e-11 = 12.566 *6.674 = approx 83.8 (since 12*6.674=80.088, 0.566*6.674≈3.777; total≈83.865).

So 83.865e-11.

Multiply by 1.225e69: 83.865e-11 *1.225e69 = 83.865 *1.225e58 → 83.865 *1.225 ≈102.8, so 102.8e58 =1.028e60.

Denominator: ħ c =1.054e-34 *3e8 = 3.162e-26.

So S = (1.028e60 ) / (3.162e-26 ) = (1.028 /3.162 )e86.

1.028 /3.162≈0.325, so S≈0.325e86 =3.25e85 J/K.

Wait, that's 3.25e85, which is about 1e85. But the options are 1e62, 1e59, 1e65, 1e66.

Hmm, that's way beyond the options. I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me re-express S.

Wait, S = (4 pi G M² )/( ħ c )

So, M is 3.5e34 kg.

So M² = (3.5e34)^2 =12.25e68 =1.225e69 kg².

So numerator: 4 pi G M² =4 *3.1416 *6.674e-11 *1.225e69.

Compute 4 pi G: 4 *3.1416 *6.674e-11 = approx 4 *3.1416 =12.566; 12.566 *6.674e-11 ≈83.86e-11.

Multiply by M² (1.225e69): 83.86e-11 *1.225e69 = 83.86 *1.225 = approx 102.8e58 → 1.028e60.

Denominator: ħ c = 1.054e-34 *3e8 = 3.162e-26.

So S = 1.028e60 / 3.162e-26 = (1.028 /3.162 )e86 → approx 0.325e86=3.25e85 J/K.

Still way higher than the options provided.

Wait, maybe I messed up the initial assumption about θ. Because in my calculation, the angular size gives R_s as 5.385e7 m, but perhaps I should have used another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the event horizon area from θ and d.

Wait, the angular size formula: θ (radians) = R_s / d.

So R_s = d * theta.

But I have theta in degrees, so I need to convert that.

But let's think in terms of the area.

A = 4 pi R_s².

But R_s = d theta, so A =4 pi d^2 theta^2.

But theta is in radians. So, if I can find A in terms of d and theta, perhaps that's easier.

So A =4 pi (d theta )² =4 pi d² theta².

So S = (A c^3 )/(4 G ħ k_B ) = (4 pi d² theta² c^3 )/(4 G ħ k_B ) ) → the 4 cancels, so S = (pi d² theta² c^3 )/( G ħ k_B )

Hmm, perhaps I should compute S using this formula.

Ok, let's plug in the numbers.

d =1e10 parsecs =1e10 *3.086e16 m =3.086e26 m.

theta =1e-17 degrees. Converting to radians: 1e-17 * (pi/180) ≈1.745e-19 radians.

So theta squared is (1.745e-19 )^2 ≈3.046e-38.

So A =4 pi (d theta )^2 = 4 pi d² theta².

Wait, but in the entropy formula, I have S = (pi d² theta² c^3 )/( G ħ k_B )

So let me compute that.

pi =3.1416.

d=3.086e26 m.

theta^2=3.046e-38.

c^3=(3e8)^3=2.7e24 m³/s³.

So numerator: 3.1416 * (3.086e26)^2 *3.046e-38 *2.7e24.

Let me compute each part.

d squared: (3.086e26 m )^2 =9.523e52 m².

Multiply by theta squared: 9.523e52 *3.046e-38 = 9.523 *3.046 ≈29.04e14 (since 52 -38=14). So 2.904e15.

Multiply by c^3: 2.904e15 *2.7e24 = 2.904 *2.7 =7.84e39.

Multiply by pi: 3.1416 *7.84e39 ≈24.6e39 =2.46e40.

Denominator: G=6.674e-11, ħ=1.054e-34, k_B=1.38e-23.

So G * ħ * k_B =6.674e-11 *1.054e-34 *1.38e-23.

Compute step by step:

6.674e-11 *1.054e-34 = (6.674 *1.054 )e-45 ≈7.03e-45.

Multiply by 1.38e-23: 7.03e-45 *1.38e-23 = (7.03 *1.38 )e-68 ≈9.68e-68.

So S = (2.46e40 ) / (9.68e-68 ) ) → 2.54e107 J/K.

Hmm, same result as before. So 1e107 J/K, which is way higher than any of the options.

Wait, the options are 1e59, 1e62, 1e65, 1e66. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of R_s. Or perhaps I should approach the problem differently.

Alternative approach: perhaps I should compute the area A of the event horizon in terms of the angular size and distance, then compute entropy.

We have A =4 pi R_s².

But R_s = d * theta.

So A =4 pi (d theta )².

So A =4 pi d² theta².

So let's compute A first.

d =3.086e26 m.

theta =1.745e-19 radians.

A =4 *3.1416 * (3.086e26)^2 * (1.745e-19 )^2.

Compute each part:

3.086e26 squared is approx 9.523e52.

(1.745e-19)^2 is approx 3.046e-38.

Multiply those: 9.523e52 *3.046e-38 = 2.904e15.

Multiply by 4 pi: 4 *3.1416 *2.904e15 = 3.1416 *11.616e15 = approx 3.1416 *1.1616e16 = 3.64e16 m².

So A ≈3.64e16 m².

Wait, that's the area. Then entropy S = (A c^3 )/(4 G ħ k_B )

So compute numerator: A c^3 =3.64e16 * (3e8)^3 =3.64e16 *2.7e24 =9.828e40.

Denominator:4 G ħ k_B.

4 *6.674e-11 =2.6696e-10.

Multiply by ħ (1.054e-34 ) and k_B (1.38e-23 ) → 2.6696e-10 *1.054e-34 =2.814e-44; then multiplied by 1.38e-23 → 3.878e-67.

So S =9.828e40 /3.878e-67 = approx 2.53e107 J/K.

Same result as before. So it's 2.5e107 J/K, which is 1e107. But the options are way lower.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a factor somewhere. Wait, the formula for entropy is S = (A c^3)/(4 G ħ k_B ) * (1/(k_B)), no, wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, the formula is S = (A c^3 )/(4 G ħ k_B ) * (k_B) ?

Wait, no, let me go back to the Bekenstein-Hawking formula.

The correct formula is S = (A c^3 )/(4 G ħ k_B ) * (something? No, I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach: The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula is S = (k_B c^3 A )/(4 ħ G ), so S = (A c^3 k_B )/(4 ħ G ).

Wait, that would change the calculation. Let's see.

So S = (A c^3 k_B )/(4 ħ G )

So with A=3.64e16 m².

c^3=2.7e24 m³/s³.

k_B=1.38e-23 J/K.

So numerator: 3.64e16 *2.7e24 *1.38e-23.

Compute that: 3.64 *2.7 =9.828; 1e16 *1e24 =1e40; 1e40 *1.38e-23 =1.38e17.

So numerator: 9.828 *1.38e17 = approx 13.55e17 =1.355e18.

Denominator:4 * ħ * G =4 *1.054e-34 *6.674e-11.

Compute denominator: 4*1.054e-34 =4.216e-34.

Multiply by 6.674e-11 →4.216e-34 *6.674e-11 =2.816e-44.

So S =1.355e18 /2.816e-44 = 4.81e61 J/K.

Ah, that's about 1e62 J/K.

Wait, that's one of the options, option A is 1e62.

Wait, but earlier I thought the formula didn't have k_B, but perhaps I was wrong. Let me double-check.

The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) *k_B ?

Wait, no, the formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G ) * (k_B), or perhaps without k_B?

Wait, checking quickly. The correct formula is S = (A c³)/(4 ħ G) (in units where k_B is incorporated into the natural units). But when expressing entropy in SI units, the formula includes Boltzmann's constant.

Wait, no, the formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 G ħ) * (k_B). Or perhaps S = (A c^3 k_B)/(4 G ħ). Because when you calculate the entropy, the units must work out. Let's see: A is m², c^3 is m^3/s^3, k_B is J/K (which is m² kg / (s² K)).

So numerator: A c^3 k_B → m² * m^3/s³ * m² kg/(s² K) ) → m^7 kg/(s^5 K).

Denominator: 4 G ħ →4 (m³/kg s²) * (J s) → J is kg m²/s², so ħ is kg m²/s.

So G is m³/kg s².

So denominator: G * ħ → (m³/kg s²) * (kg m²/s) ) = m^5/(s^3).

So numerator is m^7 kg/(s^5 K), denominator is m^5/s^3 → overall (m^7 kg/(s^5 K)) / (m^5/s^3) )= m² kg/(s² K).

But entropy is in J/K, which is kg m²/(s² K). So the formula S = (A c^3 k_B)/(4 G ħ) gives kg m²/(s² K) * something?

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated. Let me just go with the calculation I did.

In the calculation, using S = (A c^3 k_B )/(4 ħ G ), I got S ≈4.8e61 J/K, which is about 1e62, so option A.

But wait, the initial calculation using the correct formula without k_B gave 1e107, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use S = (A c^3)/(4 G ħ) * (k_B) ?

Wait, let me look up the correct formula to be sure. Oh wait, I can't look things up, I have to rely on memory.

Wait, I think the correct formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G) * (k_B) ?

Wait, no, the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula as I remember is S = (A c^3)/(4 G ħ k_B) ) × k_B? Or is it without the k_B?

Wait, no, the formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G) ) multiplied by some constant. Alternatively, another approach is to use the area in Planck units.

Wait, the area A in Planck units is A/(l_p^2 ), where l_p is the Planck length, sqrt( G ħ / c^3 ).

So S = (A/(l_p^2 )) * (k_B) ?

Wait, no, the formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 G ħ) ) × (1/k_B) ?

Not sure, but perhaps I should proceed with the calculation as done earlier, which gives 4.81e61 J/K, which is option A, 1e62.

But earlier, without considering k_B in the formula, I get 1e107, which isn't an option. So perhaps the correct approach includes k_B in the denominator.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) ) * k_B?

No, that would cancel. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 G ħ) * (k_B).

Wait, let me compute that.

In that case, with A=3.64e16 m², c^3=2.7e24, k_B=1.38e-23.

So numerator: 3.64e16 *2.7e24 *1.38e-23.

3.64e16 *2.7e24 =9.828e40; 9.828e40 *1.38e-23 =1.355e18.

Denominator:4 * ħ * G =4 *1.054e-34 *6.674e-11 =4 * (6.674e-11 *1.054e-34 ) =4 *7.03e-45 =2.812e-44.

So S=1.355e18 / 2.812e-44 →4.82e61 J/K.

Which is about 1e62, so option A.

So the correct entropy is approximately 1e62 J/K.


To determine the order of magnitude of the entropy of the supermassive black hole, we use the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula:

\[
S = \frac{A c^3}{4 G \hbar k_B}
\]

where \( A \) is the area of the event horizon, \( c \) is the speed of light, \( G \) is the gravitational constant, \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant, and \( k_B \) is Boltzmann's constant. The area \( A \) is related to the Schwarzschild radius \( R_s \) by \( A = 4 \pi R_s^2 \), and \( R_s \) can be expressed in terms of the angular size \( \theta \) and the distance \( d \) as \( R_s = d \theta \) (using the small-angle approximation).

### Step 1: Convert the angular size to radians
The angular size is given as \( \theta = 10^{-17} \, \text{degrees} \). Converting to radians:
\[
\theta = 10^{-17} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \approx 1.745 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{radians}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Schwarzschild radius
The distance to the galaxy is \( d = 10^{10} \, \text{parsecs} \). Converting to meters:
\[
d = 10^{10} \times 3.086 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m} = 3.086 \times 10^{26} \, \text{m}.
\]
Using \( R_s = d \theta \):
\[
R_s = 3.086 \times 10^{26} \times 1.745 \times 10^{-19} \approx 5.385 \times 10^7 \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the area of the event horizon
The area of the event horizon is:
\[
A = 4 \pi R_s^2 = 4 \pi (5.385 \times 10^7)^2 \approx 3.64 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m}^2.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the entropy
Substitute \( A = 3.64 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m}^2 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), \( G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \, \text{kg}^{-1} \, \text{s}^{-2} \), \( \hbar = 1.054 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J} \, \text{s} \), and \( k_B = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \) into the entropy formula:
\[
S = \frac{A c^3}{4 G \hbar k_B}.
\]
First, calculate the numerator:
\[
A c^3 = 3.64 \times 10^{16} \times (3 \times 10^8)^3 = 3.64 \times 10^{16} \times 2.7 \times 10^{24} = 9.828 \times 10^{40}.
\]
Next, calculate the denominator:
\[
4 G \hbar k_B = 4 \times 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \times 1.054 \times 10^{-34} \times 1.38 \times 10^{-23}.
\]
\[
4 G \hbar k_B = 4 \times 7.03 \times 10^{-45} \times 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \approx 3.878 \times 10^{-67}.
\]
Finally, calculate \( S \):
\[
S = \frac{9.828 \times 10^{40}}{3.878 \times 10^{-67}} \approx 2.53 \times 10^{107} \, \text{J/K}.
\]

### Step 5: Adjust for the correct formula
The correct formula includes \( k_B \) in the numerator:
\[
S = \frac{A c^3 k_B}{4 G \hbar}.
\]
Recomputing with this adjustment:
\[
S = \frac{3.64 \times 10^{16} \times (3 \times 10^8)^3 \times 1.38 \times 10^{-23}}{4 \times 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \times 1.054 \times 10^{-34}}.
\]
The numerator becomes:
\[
3.64 \times 10^{16} \times 2.7 \times 10^{24} \times 1.38 \times 10^{-23} = 1.355 \times 10^{18}.
\]
The denominator becomes:
\[
4 \times 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \times 1.054 \times 10^{-34} = 2.812 \times 10^{-44}.
\]
Thus:
\[
S = \frac{1.355 \times 10^{18}}{2.812 \times 10^{-44}} \approx 4.82 \times 10^{61} \, \text{J/K}.
\]

### Final Answer
The entropy of the black hole is approximately \( 10^{62} \, \text{J/K} \), corresponding to **Option A**.
