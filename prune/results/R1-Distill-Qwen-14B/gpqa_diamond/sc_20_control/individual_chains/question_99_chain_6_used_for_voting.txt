Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR data. The options are four different organic compounds, and I need to figure out which one it is based on the given spectra.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. The spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks around this area usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, the peak at 3000 is very broad. Oh, right, carboxylic acids have a broad, strong O-H stretch because they're usually deprotonated a bit, making the peak broader. Alternatively, if it were an alcohol, the peak might be less broad. So a broad peak here suggests a carboxylic acid group.

Then there's a strong absorption at 1700 cm^-1. That's a key region for carbonyl groups (C=O). Carboxylic acids have a carbonyl around 1700, so that fits with the O-H peak. So the compound likely has a carboxylic acid group.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data. It says that several peaks were observed, but none correspond to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones on a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound doesn't have any double bonds, or maybe it's not showing up as vinyl in the spectrum. But wait, all the options have branching and maybe some substituents, but I don't see any double bonds in the options given. So that's fine.

In the NMR, one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated. Let me think about splitting patterns. A doublet of triplets of quartets means each peak is split into a quartet due to coupling with another set, which itself is a triplet, and that's doublet. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of how many neighboring protons each proton is seeing.

Alternatively, perhaps the splitting is due to being next to two different sets of equivalent protons. Let's think about the structures.

Looking at the options:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
So, the structure is something like CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

Wait, so the middle carbons each have a CH group attached to two ethyl groups. So the structure is ((CH2CH3)C)2CHCH2COOH.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH
So, it's CH2CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH
So, the middle carbons have CH groups attached to methyl groups: (CH3)2C-C(H)(CH3)-CH2COOH. Wait, maybe not. Let me draw it out mentally.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH
Which would be CH2CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

Wait, so in the NMR, the splitting patterns are important. The presence of a doublet of triplets suggests that the proton is coupling with two different sets of neighboring protons. Let's think about the structure.

In option D, the structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So the central two CH groups each have a CH3 attached. Let's look at the central protons. Let's say each of the two central CH groups (attached to CH3 groups) are adjacent to each other. So each of those CH protons is next to another CH proton. Let me imagine the structure.

The two CH groups are on adjacent carbons. So each CH group is connected to the next CH group. So each CH is connected to two CH3 groups and a neighboring CH group. Let me try to imagine the structure:

COOH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait no, option D is CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So, the structure is:

CH2CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So the central part is CH2CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

In this structure, the CH(CH3) groups are adjacent to each other. So the middle two CH groups (each connected to CH2CH3 and COOH ends) would have neighboring protons.

So the protons on the CH(CH3) groups are next to each other. Let's consider the left CH(CH3) group. The CH protons are adjacent to the CH2CH3 group. Wait, no, the left CH(CH3) is connected to CH2CH3, and the right CH(CH3) is connected to the COOH. So the middle groups are CH(CH3) and CH(CH3), connected in a chain.

Wait, perhaps each of the CH(CH3) groups is connected to each other, but each also connected to another group. So each CH has two CH3 groups attached, and is adjacent to another CH group.

Wait, maybe the structure is like:

COOH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait no, looking back at option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So the left end is CH2CH3 (ethyl group), then a CH attached to a CH3, then another CH attached to another CH3, then COOH.

So the structure is, from left to right: ethyl group (CH2CH3), then CH(CH3), then another CH(CH3), then COOH.

Now, the protons on the CH(CH3) groups would be in a specific environment. Each of those CH protons would have neighboring groups.

Let me think about the CH protons. Each CH has two CH3 groups attached, and is next to another CH group.

So each CH proton is adjacent to another CH group. So each CH proton would be next to the two CH3 groups, but also the adjacent CH group.

Wait, perhaps each CH(CH3) is attached to the ethyl group and the adjacent CH(CH3).

So, the protons on the CH(CH3) group are on a carbon that's connected to two CH3 groups and a neighboring CH group. So each of these CH protons would have neighbors: the two CH3 groups (but those are all equivalent, so maybe that doesn't contribute to splitting), but also the adjacent CH group.

So the protons on the central CH groups would have neighboring protons from the adjacent CH group. So each CH group has two protons: wait, no, each CH has one proton. Wait, no, in CH(CH3), each CH has one H. So each CH is a CH with 3 substituents: for example, in the left CH(CH3), the substituents are CH2CH3, CH3, and the adjacent CH(CH3) group.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. Each CH is bonded to three other groups. For example, CH(CH3) is connected to:

- The ethyl group (CH2CH3) on the left,
- A methyl group (CH3),
- And the next CH(CH3) on the right.

So the structure is ethyl-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So each CH has three substituents: ethyl (for the left CH), methyl (for the left CH), and the adjacent CH group. So each CH has one proton.

So the left CH(CH3) is part of the ethyl group, and the right CH(CH3) is adjacent to the COOH.

Now, the protons on the CH(CH3) groups: each of these protons is adjacent to the neighboring CH group. So the left CH(CH3) protons are next to the right CH(CH3) protons. So each of these protons would split each other. Wait, but each CH only has one H, so perhaps the adjacent CH would have a coupling with each other.

Wait, no. Wait, each CH group has one proton. So the left CH has one H, and the right CH has another H. The left H is next to the right H. So each H on the left CH would couple with each H on the right CH. But wait, each of those CH groups only has one H, so each H is adjacent to one H on the other CH group. So each H would have a coupling with that single H, leading to a doublet.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about this. Let me imagine the left CH group: it has one H. The right CH group is adjacent, so the H's are next to each other. So each H on the left would split into a doublet due to coupling with the single H on the right. And vice versa.

Wait, but if each CH has only one H, then each H is only coupled to the H on the adjacent CH. So each H would be a doublet. But then why are the splitting patterns more complicated, like doublet of triplets, etc.?

Hmm, perhaps I'm not considering all the coupling. Maybe each CH group is also adjacent to other groups that have more H's. Let me think again.

Wait, the CH(CH3) groups are also next to ethyl and methyl groups. So for the left CH(CH3), the substituents are CH2CH3 (ethyl), CH3 (methyl), and the adjacent CH group.

But the ethyl group is CH2CH3—so the CH2 has two H's, which are adjacent to the CH(CH3) group. So perhaps the H on CH(CH3) is coupled with the two H's on the adjacent CH2.

Wait, but the ethyl group is on the left, so the structure is CH2CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So the ethyl group is CH2CH3, connected to the first CH(CH3). The first CH(CH3) is connected to the second CH(CH3), which is connected to COOH.

Wait, but the ethyl group is on the left end, so the CH2CH3 is connected to the first CH(CH3). So the ethyl group is CH2CH3, so the CH2 is connected to the CH(CH3). So the CH2 has two H's, and the CH(CH3) has one H. So the H on the CH(CH3) would be adjacent to the two H's on the CH2 group. So the coupling between the CH(CH3) H and the CH2 H's would split the signals.

So, the H on CH(CH3) would be next to the two H's on the adjacent CH2. So each H on CH(CH3) would be split into a triplet by the two H's on the CH2. But wait, each CH2 has two H's which are equivalent, so the coupling would be to a triplet.

But wait, the CH2 is connected to the CH(CH3) group. So the H on CH(CH3) is adjacent to the two H's on the CH2. So coupling with two H's would lead to a triplet. But wait, the CH(CH3) is also adjacent to another CH(CH3) group, which has one H. So the H on the CH(CH3) would couple with the CH2 H's (two H's, so triplet) and with the H on the adjacent CH(CH3) (so another splitting).

So the H's on each CH(CH3) group would have coupling with two sets: the two H's on the CH2 group (leading to a triplet), and the one H on the adjacent CH(CH3) group (leading to a doublet). So each H would be a triplet of doublets, or a doublet of triplets. Wait, the order of splitting doesn't matter much, but the pattern would be a doublet of triplets.

In the NMR data, we have a signal that's a doublet of triplets of quartets and another that's a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's more complex than I thought. Alternatively, maybe the splitting isn't just from two sources.

Wait, let's think again. The H on the CH(CH3) group (let's take the left one) is next to:

1. The two H's on the adjacent CH2 group (ethyl group). So coupling with those gives a triplet.

2. The single H on the adjacent CH(CH3) group. Coupling with that gives a doublet.

So the splitting would be triplet * doublet, which results in a doublet of triplets (or a triplet of doublets, depending on the order). So the splitting pattern would be a doublet of triplets.

Wait, but in the NMR data, one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. Hmm, so perhaps there's another coupling.

Wait, maybe I'm missing another coupling. Let's think about the structure again. The left CH(CH3) is connected to the ethyl group (CH2CH3), so the CH2 (from CH2CH3) has two H's. The CH2 is connected to the CH(CH3). So the H on the CH(CH3) would be next to the two H's on the CH2 group.

Additionally, the CH(CH3) is connected to another CH(CH3) group, which has one H. So the H on the CH(CH3) would be coupled with both the CH2 H's and the adjacent CH(CH3) H. That's two couplings—so each H would split into a triplet (from CH2) and a doublet (from CH(CH3)), giving a doublet of triplets.

But in the NMR data, one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. So maybe there's a third coupling. Where else could the H on CH(CH3) be coupled?

Ah, perhaps the CH(CH3) is also adjacent to some other groups. Wait, the ethyl group is CH2CH3, so the CH2 is connected to the CH(CH3). The CH2 has two H's. The CH(CH3) has one H. The next group is another CH(CH3), which has one H. Then the COOH group.

Wait, maybe the H on CH(CH3) is also coupled with the H's on the next CH(CH3) group. But that would be another coupling. Alternatively, maybe it's coupled with the H's from the COOH group? But the COOH group is at the end, so maybe it's a CH2COOH group.

Wait, no, the COOH is at the end, so the structure is CH2CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So the H on the left CH(CH3) is coupled with the two H's on the CH2 group, and the one H on the right CH(CH3). So that's two couplings, leading to a doublet of triplets.

But the NMR data mentions a quartet as part of the splitting. Perhaps another coupling is present. Alternatively, maybe I'm considering the wrong structure.

Wait, let's look at the options again. Let's consider each option and their structures.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH

So the structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH.

Wait, so the middle part is two CH groups, each attached to a C2H5 (ethyl) group. So the structure is CH2CH3-(CH)(C2H5)-(CH)(C2H5)-COOH.

Wait, but that can't be correct because each CH can only have four bonds. Oh wait, the formula is CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. So each CH has two substituents: one from the ethyl chain and another from the adjacent CH group.

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw the structure as:

CH2CH3-C(CH2CH3)(H)-C(CH2CH3)(H)-COOH.

But wait, that's not possible because each CH can't have three substituents. Oh wait, each CH is connected to two substituents besides the adjacent CH groups.

Wait, perhaps each C in the middle has one H and two ethyl groups. So the structure is:

COOH - C(CH2CH3)(H) - C(CH2CH3)(H) - CH2CH3.

So the middle two C's each have a H and two ethyl groups attached. So each of those CH's is connected to two ethyl groups and a H.

So the structure is CH2CH3-C(CH2CH3)H - C(CH2CH3)H - COOH.

In that case, the two CH groups each have a H and two ethyl groups.

So the H's on these CH groups would be adjacent to each other. Each CH group's H is next to the other CH group's H. So each H would couple with the H on the adjacent CH group.

Additionally, each CH group is connected to two ethyl groups (each with two H's). So each H on the CH groups would also be coupled with the H's on the adjacent ethyl groups.

Wait, but the ethyl groups are attached to the same C as the H. So the H is on a CH group connected to two ethyl groups. The ethyl groups are CH2CH3, so each has two H's on the CH2. So each H on the CH would be adjacent to the two H's on the CH2 of each ethyl group.

Wait, but each CH is attached to two ethyl groups. So each CH group is attached to two CH2CH3 groups. So each CH group is connected to two ethyl groups, each of which has two H's on the adjacent CH2.

So each H on the CH would be adjacent to four H's: two from each ethyl group's CH2. But wait, the ethyl groups are on the same carbon as the CH group's H, so the H's on the CH are adjacent to the two H's on each of the two ethyl groups.

Wait, that's a lot of H's. So each H on the CH is adjacent to four H's: two from each ethyl group. But each ethyl group is a CH2CH3, so the CH2 has two H's. But since each CH is attached to two ethyl groups, each H on the CH would be adjacent to four H's: two from each adjacent CH2 group.

So the H on the CH would be coupled with four H's (two from each ethyl group's CH2). So each H would split into a quintet (n+1, where n=4). But wait, are the two CH2 groups equivalent? If they are, then the four H's would be equivalent, leading to a quintet. But if the two ethyl groups are in different environments, then perhaps the coupling is with two separate sets of two H's, leading to a triplet for each set and then a doublet of triplets overall.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think about the splitting patterns again.

In the NMR data, one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. So that suggests that each proton is coupling with multiple sets of neighboring H's.

Let's go back to option D again. Structure is CH2CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So each CH(CH3) has one H. The left CH(CH3) is connected to CH2CH3, the right is connected to COOH.

The H on the left CH(CH3) is adjacent to:

- The two H's on the CH2CH3's CH2 group. So that's two H's, leading to a triplet.

- The H on the right CH(CH3) group, which is one H, leading to a doublet.

So the splitting would be triplet * doublet, giving a doublet of triplets.

But in the NMR data, one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. So where's the quartet coming from? Maybe another coupling.

Wait, perhaps the H on the left CH(CH3) is also coupled with the H on the adjacent CH2 group. No, the CH2 group is part of the ethyl group attached to the CH(CH3), so the H is already coupled with the two H's on the CH2.

Wait, perhaps the H on the CH(CH3) is also coupled with the H's on the adjacent CH(CH3) group. But that's the same as the previous coupling. So each H is coupled to two H's (the CH2) and one H (the adjacent CH(CH3)).

So that would result in a triplet (from CH2) and a doublet (from CH(CH3)), leading to a doublet of triplets.

But the NMR data has a quartet as part of the splitting. So perhaps the H is also coupled with another set of H's.

Wait, perhaps the H on the CH(CH3) is also coupled with the H's on the CH2 group next to the ethyl.

Wait, the CH2 group is part of the ethyl (CH2CH3). The H on CH(CH3) is adjacent to the CH2's two H's, so that's a triplet. Then, the H on CH(CH3) is also adjacent to the H on the other CH(CH3) group (so a doublet). If there's another coupling, perhaps with the H's on the COOH's adjacent groups. But COOH is at the end, so maybe there's a CH2COOH group nearby.

Wait, looking at option D again: the structure is ethyl-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Wait, the COOH is at the end, so the H's on the CH(CH3) groups are adjacent only to each other and the ethyl group's CH2.

So perhaps the splitting is a doublet of triplets.

But the NMR data mentions something more complex, like a doublet of triplets of quartets. Hmm. So maybe I'm looking at the wrong option.

Let's consider another option. Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH.

Structure: CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

So the structure is (CH3)2C-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

Wait, perhaps that's a mistake. Let me parse it correctly.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH.

So, the structure is CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

So the first carbon is CH3, then a CH connected to another CH3, then another CH connected to another CH3, then a CH2 connected to the COOH.

So the structure is:

CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

In this case, the middle CH groups are each attached to a CH3 and are adjacent to each other.

So the H's on each CH(CH3) are adjacent to each other. Each H on the middle CH groups would couple with the H on the adjacent CH group. Additionally, each of these H's would be adjacent to the H's on the CH2 group (two H's) at the end.

Wait, the CH2 group is connected to the COOH, so it's CH2COOH. So each H on the middle CH groups is adjacent to two H's on the adjacent CH2 group. So the coupling would be two H's, leading to a triplet.

Additionally, each H on the middle CH group is adjacent to the H on the other middle CH group, leading to a doublet. So the splitting would be a triplet (from CH2) and a doublet (from adjacent CH), leading to a doublet of triplets.

But again, the NMR data has a more complex splitting. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the H's on the middle CH groups are also coupled with the H's on the adjacent CH3 groups. Oh, but the CH3 groups are attached to the same C as the H, so maybe those H's are equivalent and don't cause splitting? Or perhaps they do.

Wait, the H on CH(CH3) is on a carbon with two CH3 groups attached. So the H is adjacent to the two CH3 groups, but the CH3 H's are all equivalent. So each H on CH(CH3) would be coupled with the two CH3 H's. But wait, each CH3 has three H's, so the coupling with each CH3 would be a quartet (n=3, so n+1=4). But if the two CH3 groups are equivalent, perhaps the coupling is with six H's in total, leading to a septet? That seems too complicated.

Alternatively, the H on CH(CH3) would be coupled with the H's on the adjacent CH group and the H's on the CH2 group. Let me think.

Option C's structure: CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

So the middle two CH groups each have a CH3 attached and are adjacent to each other.

The H's on these CH groups would be adjacent to each other, so each H would couple with the other, giving a doublet. Also, each H is adjacent to the two H's on the CH2 group (from CH2COOH), giving a triplet. So the splitting would be a doublet of triplets.

Additionally, each H is attached to a CH3 group. The CH3 groups have three H's each. So each H on the CH group would be coupled with the three H's on the adjacent CH3 group. That would split each peak into a quartet (n=3, n+1=4). So the splitting would be a quartet (from CH3), a triplet (from CH2), and a doublet (from adjacent CH group). So the overall splitting would be a quartet of triplets of doublets, or a doublet of triplets of quartets.

Ah, that would explain the NMR data. So in option C, each H on the middle CH group is coupled with:

- The three H's on the adjacent CH3 group (quartet).
- The two H's on the CH2 group (triplet).
- The one H on the adjacent CH group (doublet).

So the splitting would be a doublet of triplets of quartets, which matches the first description in the NMR data. And another signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets, which perhaps comes from another part of the molecule, like the CH3 groups.

Let me check the other options.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

Structure: CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

So each middle CH group has a C2H5 (ethyl) substituent.

The H's on these CH groups would be adjacent to each other, leading to a doublet. Also, each H is adjacent to the two H's on the adjacent ethyl groups. Each ethyl group has two H's on the CH2, so four H's in total. So each H on the CH would be coupled with four H's (two from each ethyl group), leading to a quintet. Also, each H is coupled with the H on the adjacent CH group (doublet). So the splitting would be a quintet of doublets, which doesn't match the NMR data.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH.

Structure: CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH.

Each middle CH group has an ethyl substituent. The H on each CH is adjacent to the H on the other CH group (doublet) and the two H's on each ethyl group (so four H's in total, leading to a quintet). So each H would split into a quintet of doublets, which doesn't match the given NMR signals.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

Structure: CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

Each middle CH group has a methyl substituent. The H on each CH is adjacent to the H on the other CH group (doublet) and the two H's on the CH2 group of the ethyl substituent (triplet). So each H would be a doublet of triplets.

But in the NMR data, there's a quartet involved.

So, going back to option C: each H on the middle CH groups is coupled with the CH3 group (quartet), the CH2 group (triplet), and the adjacent CH (doublet), leading to a doublet of triplets of quartets. Which matches part of the NMR data. The other signal being a doublet of triplets of triplets might come from another part, like the CH3 groups or the CH2COOH.

Wait, in option C, the CH3 groups are on the same C as the H's, so their H's would not be split by the CH H's. The CH3 groups would be in a different environment, perhaps as singlets or with some coupling. But the key is that the H's on the middle CH groups would have the complex splitting described.

So, putting it all together, the FTIR shows a broad O-H (carboxylic acid) and a carbonyl (C=O) at 1700 cm^-1. The NMR shows a complex splitting pattern, which would arise in option C due to coupling with CH3, CH2, and adjacent CH groups.

So the correct option is C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To identify the unknown compound, the provided FTIR and 1H NMR data were analyzed alongside the four options. The FTIR spectrum shows a broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹, indicative of an O-H stretch, and a strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O). This suggests the compound contains a carboxylic acid group.

The 1H NMR spectrum reveals several signals, none corresponding to vinyl hydrogens, meaning no double bonds are present. Two notable splitting patterns are described: a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets. These complex splitting patterns suggest that the protons in question are coupled to multiple sets of neighboring protons.

### Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A: CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**
- The structure is CH₃-C(H)(C₂H₅)-C(H)(C₂H₅)-CH₂COOH.
- The H on each CH group is adjacent to two ethyl groups (each with two H's) and the H on the adjacent CH group.
- Coupling with the four H's from the two ethyl groups (quintet) and the one H from the adjacent CH group (doublet) would result in a quintet of doublets, which does not match the NMR data.

#### **Option B: CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH**
- The structure is CH₃CH₂-C(H)(C₂H₅)-C(H)(C₂H₅)-COOH.
- Similar to Option A, the H on each CH group is adjacent to two ethyl groups (each with two H's) and the H on the adjacent CH group.
- Coupling with the four H's from the two ethyl groups (quintet) and the one H from the adjacent CH group (doublet) would result in a quintet of doublets, which does not match the NMR data.

#### **Option C: CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH**
- The structure is CH₃-C(H)(CH₃)-C(H)(CH₃)-CH₂COOH.
- The H on each CH group is adjacent to:
  1. Three H's from the CH₃ group (quartet).
  2. Two H's from the CH₂ group (triplet).
  3. One H from the adjacent CH group (doublet).
- This results in a splitting pattern of a doublet of triplets of quartets, which matches the first signal described in the NMR data. Another signal, described as a doublet of triplets of triplets, could arise from other protons in the molecule, such as the CH₃ groups.

#### **Option D: CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH**
- The structure is CH₃CH₂-C(H)(CH₃)-C(H)(CH₃)-COOH.
- The H on each CH group is adjacent to:
  1. Two H's from the CH₂ group (triplet).
  2. One H from the adjacent CH group (doublet).
- This results in a splitting pattern of a doublet of triplets, which does not fully match the NMR data, as no quartet splitting is observed.

### Conclusion:
Option C best matches the FTIR and 1H NMR data. The splitting patterns in the NMR spectrum are consistent with the coupling of protons in the CH groups to the CH₃, CH₂, and adjacent CH groups, as described in Option C.

**Answer: C**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR data. The options are four different organic compounds, and I need to figure out which one it is based on the given spectra.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. The spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks around this area usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, the peak at 3000 is very broad. Oh, right, carboxylic acids have a broad, strong O-H stretch because they're usually deprotonated a bit, making the peak broader. Alternatively, if it were an alcohol, the peak might be less broad. So a broad peak here suggests a carboxylic acid group.

Then there's a strong absorption at 1700 cm^-1. That's a key region for carbonyl groups (C=O). Carboxylic acids have a carbonyl around 1700, so that fits with the O-H peak. So the compound likely has a carboxylic acid group.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data. It says that several peaks were observed, but none correspond to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones on a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound doesn't have any double bonds, or maybe it's not showing up as vinyl in the spectrum. But wait, all the options have branching and maybe some substituents, but I don't see any double bonds in the options given. So that's fine.

In the NMR, one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated. Let me think about splitting patterns. A doublet of triplets of quartets means each peak is split into a quartet due to coupling with another set, which itself is a triplet, and that's doublet. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of how many neighboring protons each proton is seeing.

Alternatively, perhaps the splitting is due to being next to two different sets of equivalent protons. Let's think about the structures.

Looking at the options:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
So, the structure is something like CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

Wait, so the middle carbons each have a CH group attached to two ethyl groups. So the structure is ((CH2CH3)C)2CHCH2COOH.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH
So, it's CH2CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH
So, the middle carbons have CH groups attached to methyl groups: (CH3)2C-C(H)(CH3)-CH2COOH. Wait, maybe not. Let me draw it out mentally.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH
Which would be CH2CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

Wait, so in the NMR, the splitting patterns are important. The presence of a doublet of triplets suggests that the proton is coupling with two different sets of neighboring protons. Let's think about the structure.

In option D, the structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So the central two CH groups each have a CH3 attached. Let's look at the central protons. Let's say each of the two central CH groups (attached to CH3 groups) are adjacent to each other. So each of those CH protons is next to another CH proton. Let me imagine the structure.

The two CH groups are on adjacent carbons. So each CH group is connected to the next CH group. So each CH is connected to two CH3 groups and a neighboring CH group. Let me try to imagine the structure:

COOH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait no, option D is CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So, the structure is:

CH2CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So the central part is CH2CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

In this structure, the CH(CH3) groups are adjacent to each other. So the middle two CH groups (each connected to CH2CH3 and COOH ends) would have neighboring protons.

So the protons on the CH(CH3) groups are next to each other. Let's consider the left CH(CH3) group. The CH protons are adjacent to the CH2CH3 group. Wait, no, the left CH(CH3) is connected to CH2CH3, and the right CH(CH3) is connected to the COOH. So the middle groups are CH(CH3) and CH(CH3), connected in a chain.

Wait, perhaps each of the CH(CH3) groups is connected to each other, but each also connected to another group. So each CH has two CH3 groups attached, and is adjacent to another CH group.

Wait, maybe the structure is like:

COOH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait no, looking back at option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So the left end is CH2CH3 (ethyl group), then a CH attached to a CH3, then another CH attached to another CH3, then COOH.

So the structure is, from left to right: ethyl group (CH2CH3), then CH(CH3), then another CH(CH3), then COOH.

Now, the protons on the CH(CH3) groups would be in a specific environment. Each of those CH protons would have neighboring groups.

Let me think about the CH protons. Each CH has two CH3 groups attached, and is next to another CH group.

So each CH proton is adjacent to another CH group. So each CH proton would be next to the two CH3 groups, but also the adjacent CH group.

Wait, perhaps each CH(CH3) is attached to the ethyl group and the adjacent CH(CH3).

So, the protons on the CH(CH3) group are on a carbon that's connected to two CH3 groups and a neighboring CH group. So each of these CH protons would have neighbors: the two CH3 groups (but those are all equivalent, so maybe that doesn't contribute to splitting), but also the adjacent CH group.

So the protons on the central CH groups would have neighboring protons from the adjacent CH group. So each CH group has two protons: wait, no, each CH has one proton. Wait, no, in CH(CH3), each CH has one H. So each CH is a CH with 3 substituents: for example, in the left CH(CH3), the substituents are CH2CH3, CH3, and the adjacent CH(CH3) group.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. Each CH is bonded to three other groups. For example, CH(CH3) is connected to:

- The ethyl group (CH2CH3) on the left,
- A methyl group (CH3),
- And the next CH(CH3) on the right.

So the structure is ethyl-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So each CH has three substituents: ethyl (for the left CH), methyl (for the left CH), and the adjacent CH group. So each CH has one proton.

So the left CH(CH3) is part of the ethyl group, and the right CH(CH3) is adjacent to the COOH.

Now, the protons on the CH(CH3) groups: each of these protons is adjacent to the neighboring CH group. So the left CH(CH3) protons are next to the right CH(CH3) protons. So each of these protons would split each other. Wait, but each CH only has one H, so perhaps the adjacent CH would have a coupling with each other.

Wait, no. Wait, each CH group has one proton. So the left CH has one H, and the right CH has another H. The left H is next to the right H. So each H on the left CH would couple with each H on the right CH. But wait, each of those CH groups only has one H, so each H is adjacent to one H on the other CH group. So each H would have a coupling with that single H, leading to a doublet.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about this. Let me imagine the left CH group: it has one H. The right CH group is adjacent, so the H's are next to each other. So each H on the left would split into a doublet due to coupling with the single H on the right. And vice versa.

Wait, but if each CH has only one H, then each H is only coupled to the H on the adjacent CH. So each H would be a doublet. But then why are the splitting patterns more complicated, like doublet of triplets, etc.?

Hmm, perhaps I'm not considering all the coupling. Maybe each CH group is also adjacent to other groups that have more H's. Let me think again.

Wait, the CH(CH3) groups are also next to ethyl and methyl groups. So for the left CH(CH3), the substituents are CH2CH3 (ethyl), CH3 (methyl), and the adjacent CH group.

But the ethyl group is CH2CH3—so the CH2 has two H's, which are adjacent to the CH(CH3) group. So perhaps the H on CH(CH3) is coupled with the two H's on the adjacent CH2.

Wait, but the ethyl group is on the left, so the structure is CH2CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So the ethyl group is CH2CH3, connected to the first CH(CH3). The first CH(CH3) is connected to the second CH(CH3), which is connected to COOH.

Wait, but the ethyl group is on the left end, so the CH2CH3 is connected to the first CH(CH3). So the ethyl group is CH2CH3, so the CH2 is connected to the CH(CH3). So the CH2 has two H's, and the CH(CH3) has one H. So the H on the CH(CH3) would be adjacent to the two H's on the CH2 group. So the coupling between the CH(CH3) H and the CH2 H's would split the signals.

So, the H on CH(CH3) would be next to the two H's on the adjacent CH2. So each H on CH(CH3) would be split into a triplet by the two H's on the CH2. But wait, each CH2 has two H's which are equivalent, so the coupling would be to a triplet.

But wait, the CH2 is connected to the CH(CH3) group. So the H on CH(CH3) is adjacent to the two H's on the CH2. So coupling with two H's would lead to a triplet. But wait, the CH(CH3) is also adjacent to another CH(CH3) group, which has one H. So the H on the CH(CH3) would couple with the CH2 H's (two H's, so triplet) and with the H on the adjacent CH(CH3) (so another splitting).

So the H's on each CH(CH3) group would have coupling with two sets: the two H's on the CH2 group (leading to a triplet), and the one H on the adjacent CH(CH3) group (leading to a doublet). So each H would be a triplet of doublets, or a doublet of triplets. Wait, the order of splitting doesn't matter much, but the pattern would be a doublet of triplets.

In the NMR data, we have a signal that's a doublet of triplets of quartets and another that's a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's more complex than I thought. Alternatively, maybe the splitting isn't just from two sources.

Wait, let's think again. The H on the CH(CH3) group (let's take the left one) is next to:

1. The two H's on the adjacent CH2 group (ethyl group). So coupling with those gives a triplet.

2. The single H on the adjacent CH(CH3) group. Coupling with that gives a doublet.

So the splitting would be triplet * doublet, which results in a doublet of triplets (or a triplet of doublets, depending on the order). So the splitting pattern would be a doublet of triplets.

Wait, but in the NMR data, one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. Hmm, so perhaps there's another coupling.

Wait, maybe I'm missing another coupling. Let's think about the structure again. The left CH(CH3) is connected to the ethyl group (CH2CH3), so the CH2 (from CH2CH3) has two H's. The CH2 is connected to the CH(CH3). So the H on the CH(CH3) would be next to the two H's on the CH2 group.

Additionally, the CH(CH3) is connected to another CH(CH3) group, which has one H. So the H on the CH(CH3) would be coupled with both the CH2 H's and the adjacent CH(CH3) H. That's two couplings—so each H would split into a triplet (from CH2) and a doublet (from CH(CH3)), giving a doublet of triplets.

But in the NMR data, one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. So maybe there's a third coupling. Where else could the H on CH(CH3) be coupled?

Ah, perhaps the CH(CH3) is also adjacent to some other groups. Wait, the ethyl group is CH2CH3, so the CH2 is connected to the CH(CH3). The CH2 has two H's. The CH(CH3) has one H. The next group is another CH(CH3), which has one H. Then the COOH group.

Wait, maybe the H on CH(CH3) is also coupled with the H's on the next CH(CH3) group. But that would be another coupling. Alternatively, maybe it's coupled with the H's from the COOH group? But the COOH group is at the end, so maybe it's a CH2COOH group.

Wait, no, the COOH is at the end, so the structure is CH2CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So the H on the left CH(CH3) is coupled with the two H's on the CH2 group, and the one H on the right CH(CH3). So that's two couplings, leading to a doublet of triplets.

But the NMR data mentions a quartet as part of the splitting. Perhaps another coupling is present. Alternatively, maybe I'm considering the wrong structure.

Wait, let's look at the options again. Let's consider each option and their structures.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH

So the structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH.

Wait, so the middle part is two CH groups, each attached to a C2H5 (ethyl) group. So the structure is CH2CH3-(CH)(C2H5)-(CH)(C2H5)-COOH.

Wait, but that can't be correct because each CH can only have four bonds. Oh wait, the formula is CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. So each CH has two substituents: one from the ethyl chain and another from the adjacent CH group.

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw the structure as:

CH2CH3-C(CH2CH3)(H)-C(CH2CH3)(H)-COOH.

But wait, that's not possible because each CH can't have three substituents. Oh wait, each CH is connected to two substituents besides the adjacent CH groups.

Wait, perhaps each C in the middle has one H and two ethyl groups. So the structure is:

COOH - C(CH2CH3)(H) - C(CH2CH3)(H) - CH2CH3.

So the middle two C's each have a H and two ethyl groups attached. So each of those CH's is connected to two ethyl groups and a H.

So the structure is CH2CH3-C(CH2CH3)H - C(CH2CH3)H - COOH.

In that case, the two CH groups each have a H and two ethyl groups.

So the H's on these CH groups would be adjacent to each other. Each CH group's H is next to the other CH group's H. So each H would couple with the H on the adjacent CH group.

Additionally, each CH group is connected to two ethyl groups (each with two H's). So each H on the CH groups would also be coupled with the H's on the adjacent ethyl groups.

Wait, but the ethyl groups are attached to the same C as the H. So the H is on a CH group connected to two ethyl groups. The ethyl groups are CH2CH3, so each has two H's on the CH2. So each H on the CH would be adjacent to the two H's on the CH2 of each ethyl group.

Wait, but each CH is attached to two ethyl groups. So each CH group is attached to two CH2CH3 groups. So each CH group is connected to two ethyl groups, each of which has two H's on the adjacent CH2.

So each H on the CH would be adjacent to four H's: two from each ethyl group's CH2. But wait, the ethyl groups are on the same carbon as the CH group's H, so the H's on the CH are adjacent to the two H's on each of the two ethyl groups.

Wait, that's a lot of H's. So each H on the CH is adjacent to four H's: two from each ethyl group. But each ethyl group is a CH2CH3, so the CH2 has two H's. But since each CH is attached to two ethyl groups, each H on the CH would be adjacent to four H's: two from each adjacent CH2 group.

So the H on the CH would be coupled with four H's (two from each ethyl group's CH2). So each H would split into a quintet (n+1, where n=4). But wait, are the two CH2 groups equivalent? If they are, then the four H's would be equivalent, leading to a quintet. But if the two ethyl groups are in different environments, then perhaps the coupling is with two separate sets of two H's, leading to a triplet for each set and then a doublet of triplets overall.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think about the splitting patterns again.

In the NMR data, one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. So that suggests that each proton is coupling with multiple sets of neighboring H's.

Let's go back to option D again. Structure is CH2CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So each CH(CH3) has one H. The left CH(CH3) is connected to CH2CH3, the right is connected to COOH.

The H on the left CH(CH3) is adjacent to:

- The two H's on the CH2CH3's CH2 group. So that's two H's, leading to a triplet.

- The H on the right CH(CH3) group, which is one H, leading to a doublet.

So the splitting would be triplet * doublet, giving a doublet of triplets.

But in the NMR data, one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. So where's the quartet coming from? Maybe another coupling.

Wait, perhaps the H on the left CH(CH3) is also coupled with the H on the adjacent CH2 group. No, the CH2 group is part of the ethyl group attached to the CH(CH3), so the H is already coupled with the two H's on the CH2.

Wait, perhaps the H on the CH(CH3) is also coupled with the H's on the adjacent CH(CH3) group. But that's the same as the previous coupling. So each H is coupled to two H's (the CH2) and one H (the adjacent CH(CH3)).

So that would result in a triplet (from CH2) and a doublet (from CH(CH3)), leading to a doublet of triplets.

But the NMR data has a quartet as part of the splitting. So perhaps the H is also coupled with another set of H's.

Wait, perhaps the H on the CH(CH3) is also coupled with the H's on the CH2 group next to the ethyl.

Wait, the CH2 group is part of the ethyl (CH2CH3). The H on CH(CH3) is adjacent to the CH2's two H's, so that's a triplet. Then, the H on CH(CH3) is also adjacent to the H on the other CH(CH3) group (so a doublet). If there's another coupling, perhaps with the H's on the COOH's adjacent groups. But COOH is at the end, so maybe there's a CH2COOH group nearby.

Wait, looking at option D again: the structure is ethyl-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Wait, the COOH is at the end, so the H's on the CH(CH3) groups are adjacent only to each other and the ethyl group's CH2.

So perhaps the splitting is a doublet of triplets.

But the NMR data mentions something more complex, like a doublet of triplets of quartets. Hmm. So maybe I'm looking at the wrong option.

Let's consider another option. Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH.

Structure: CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

So the structure is (CH3)2C-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

Wait, perhaps that's a mistake. Let me parse it correctly.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH.

So, the structure is CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

So the first carbon is CH3, then a CH connected to another CH3, then another CH connected to another CH3, then a CH2 connected to the COOH.

So the structure is:

CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

In this case, the middle CH groups are each attached to a CH3 and are adjacent to each other.

So the H's on each CH(CH3) are adjacent to each other. Each H on the middle CH groups would couple with the H on the adjacent CH group. Additionally, each of these H's would be adjacent to the H's on the CH2 group (two H's) at the end.

Wait, the CH2 group is connected to the COOH, so it's CH2COOH. So each H on the middle CH groups is adjacent to two H's on the adjacent CH2 group. So the coupling would be two H's, leading to a triplet.

Additionally, each H on the middle CH group is adjacent to the H on the other middle CH group, leading to a doublet. So the splitting would be a triplet (from CH2) and a doublet (from adjacent CH), leading to a doublet of triplets.

But again, the NMR data has a more complex splitting. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the H's on the middle CH groups are also coupled with the H's on the adjacent CH3 groups. Oh, but the CH3 groups are attached to the same C as the H, so maybe those H's are equivalent and don't cause splitting? Or perhaps they do.

Wait, the H on CH(CH3) is on a carbon with two CH3 groups attached. So the H is adjacent to the two CH3 groups, but the CH3 H's are all equivalent. So each H on CH(CH3) would be coupled with the two CH3 H's. But wait, each CH3 has three H's, so the coupling with each CH3 would be a quartet (n=3, so n+1=4). But if the two CH3 groups are equivalent, perhaps the coupling is with six H's in total, leading to a septet? That seems too complicated.

Alternatively, the H on CH(CH3) would be coupled with the H's on the adjacent CH group and the H's on the CH2 group. Let me think.

Option C's structure: CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

So the middle two CH groups each have a CH3 attached and are adjacent to each other.

The H's on these CH groups would be adjacent to each other, so each H would couple with the other, giving a doublet. Also, each H is adjacent to the two H's on the CH2 group (from CH2COOH), giving a triplet. So the splitting would be a doublet of triplets.

Additionally, each H is attached to a CH3 group. The CH3 groups have three H's each. So each H on the CH group would be coupled with the three H's on the adjacent CH3 group. That would split each peak into a quartet (n=3, n+1=4). So the splitting would be a quartet (from CH3), a triplet (from CH2), and a doublet (from adjacent CH group). So the overall splitting would be a quartet of triplets of doublets, or a doublet of triplets of quartets.

Ah, that would explain the NMR data. So in option C, each H on the middle CH group is coupled with:

- The three H's on the adjacent CH3 group (quartet).
- The two H's on the CH2 group (triplet).
- The one H on the adjacent CH group (doublet).

So the splitting would be a doublet of triplets of quartets, which matches the first description in the NMR data. And another signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets, which perhaps comes from another part of the molecule, like the CH3 groups.

Let me check the other options.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

Structure: CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

So each middle CH group has a C2H5 (ethyl) substituent.

The H's on these CH groups would be adjacent to each other, leading to a doublet. Also, each H is adjacent to the two H's on the adjacent ethyl groups. Each ethyl group has two H's on the CH2, so four H's in total. So each H on the CH would be coupled with four H's (two from each ethyl group), leading to a quintet. Also, each H is coupled with the H on the adjacent CH group (doublet). So the splitting would be a quintet of doublets, which doesn't match the NMR data.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH.

Structure: CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH.

Each middle CH group has an ethyl substituent. The H on each CH is adjacent to the H on the other CH group (doublet) and the two H's on each ethyl group (so four H's in total, leading to a quintet). So each H would split into a quintet of doublets, which doesn't match the given NMR signals.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

Structure: CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

Each middle CH group has a methyl substituent. The H on each CH is adjacent to the H on the other CH group (doublet) and the two H's on the CH2 group of the ethyl substituent (triplet). So each H would be a doublet of triplets.

But in the NMR data, there's a quartet involved.

So, going back to option C: each H on the middle CH groups is coupled with the CH3 group (quartet), the CH2 group (triplet), and the adjacent CH (doublet), leading to a doublet of triplets of quartets. Which matches part of the NMR data. The other signal being a doublet of triplets of triplets might come from another part, like the CH3 groups or the CH2COOH.

Wait, in option C, the CH3 groups are on the same C as the H's, so their H's would not be split by the CH H's. The CH3 groups would be in a different environment, perhaps as singlets or with some coupling. But the key is that the H's on the middle CH groups would have the complex splitting described.

So, putting it all together, the FTIR shows a broad O-H (carboxylic acid) and a carbonyl (C=O) at 1700 cm^-1. The NMR shows a complex splitting pattern, which would arise in option C due to coupling with CH3, CH2, and adjacent CH groups.

So the correct option is C.


To identify the unknown compound, the provided FTIR and 1H NMR data were analyzed alongside the four options. The FTIR spectrum shows a broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹, indicative of an O-H stretch, and a strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O). This suggests the compound contains a carboxylic acid group.

The 1H NMR spectrum reveals several signals, none corresponding to vinyl hydrogens, meaning no double bonds are present. Two notable splitting patterns are described: a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets. These complex splitting patterns suggest that the protons in question are coupled to multiple sets of neighboring protons.

### Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A: CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**
- The structure is CH₃-C(H)(C₂H₅)-C(H)(C₂H₅)-CH₂COOH.
- The H on each CH group is adjacent to two ethyl groups (each with two H's) and the H on the adjacent CH group.
- Coupling with the four H's from the two ethyl groups (quintet) and the one H from the adjacent CH group (doublet) would result in a quintet of doublets, which does not match the NMR data.

#### **Option B: CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH**
- The structure is CH₃CH₂-C(H)(C₂H₅)-C(H)(C₂H₅)-COOH.
- Similar to Option A, the H on each CH group is adjacent to two ethyl groups (each with two H's) and the H on the adjacent CH group.
- Coupling with the four H's from the two ethyl groups (quintet) and the one H from the adjacent CH group (doublet) would result in a quintet of doublets, which does not match the NMR data.

#### **Option C: CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH**
- The structure is CH₃-C(H)(CH₃)-C(H)(CH₃)-CH₂COOH.
- The H on each CH group is adjacent to:
  1. Three H's from the CH₃ group (quartet).
  2. Two H's from the CH₂ group (triplet).
  3. One H from the adjacent CH group (doublet).
- This results in a splitting pattern of a doublet of triplets of quartets, which matches the first signal described in the NMR data. Another signal, described as a doublet of triplets of triplets, could arise from other protons in the molecule, such as the CH₃ groups.

#### **Option D: CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH**
- The structure is CH₃CH₂-C(H)(CH₃)-C(H)(CH₃)-COOH.
- The H on each CH group is adjacent to:
  1. Two H's from the CH₂ group (triplet).
  2. One H from the adjacent CH group (doublet).
- This results in a splitting pattern of a doublet of triplets, which does not fully match the NMR data, as no quartet splitting is observed.

### Conclusion:
Option C best matches the FTIR and 1H NMR data. The splitting patterns in the NMR spectrum are consistent with the coupling of protons in the CH groups to the CH₃, CH₂, and adjacent CH groups, as described in Option C.

**Answer: C**
