Okay, let's try to tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through step by step. 

So the question is about a reaction involving Substance X, liquid Y, and the products. Let's break down the information given.

First, Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. That hints that X might be something like a heavy water isotope, maybe D2O instead of H2O, but I'm not sure yet.

It reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Wait, that sounds familiar. Which gases have that property? Let's think. Hydrogen has one proton and one neutron if it's deuterium, but wait, no, wait. Let me think about the atoms. For a molecule, like H2, each H has 1 p and 0 n. So for H2, each molecule has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. That can't be. Wait, maybe another gas.

Wait, another thought: Argon has an atomic number of 18, so it has 18 protons. Neutrons would be 22 (since Ar has a mass number of 40 usually). Oh wait, but gas W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. So each molecule must have the same total of p and n.

Wait, another possibility: maybe CO2? No, that wouldn't fit. Or perhaps something like O2? No, O has 8 protons, each O atom 8 p and 8 n (since O-16 has 8 neutrons). So O2 would have 16 p and 16 n. Oh wait, that fits. So protons and neutrons in the molecule would be equal. O2 (each O has 8 p and 8 n, so two O atoms would have 16 p and 16 n in the molecule). So gas W could be O2? But wait, when does a violent reaction produce O2? Hmm, maybe not.

Wait another angle: the gas W's molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. Let's think about its formula. Let’s denote the molecule as A with m atoms. The total number of protons in the molecule would be m × (atomic number of A). The total number of neutrons would be m × (mass number of A - atomic number of A). We need protons = neutrons.

So m × (Z) = m × (N - Z), so Z = (N - Z) → 2Z = N → N = 2Z. So the mass number is twice the atomic number. So possible atoms could be:

- For Hydrogen (Z=1): N=2. So H-2 (deuterium). But H2 as gas: each molecule has 2 H atoms. So H2 would have 2×1=2 protons and 2×1=2 neutrons (since each is deuterium). So protons = 2, neutrons = 2 → equal. So W could be H2 (but as deuterium would be D2). But wait, the reaction is violent, so maybe it's not that.

Wait another element: Carbon. Z=6. So N=12. So carbon-12. If gas W is C, but C is a solid usually. Or perhaps CO2? No, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe nitrogen? Z=7 → N=14. So N-14. But N2 as gas: each N atom has 7 p and 7 n. So molecule would have 14 p and 14 n → equal. So N2 could be a possibility. But under what reaction conditions would N2 be produced? Alternatively, maybe CO can't be because CO has Z=7 (C) + Z=8 (O) per molecule. Wait, no, CO is a molecule with one C and one O. So total protons would be 6 + 8 =14; neutrons would be (12-6)+(16-8) =6 +8=14. So CO's molecule has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. So CO could be gas W. But I'm not sure if that's a product of such a reaction.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is CH4? No, because for CH4, each molecule would have 6 (from C) + 4*(1 from H) = 10 protons. Neutrons: C is 12-6=6, each H has 0 neutrons (assuming H-1), so 6 + 0 *4 =6. So 10 protons vs 6 neutrons: not equal. So that's not it.

Wait, let's think of another approach. Maybe the gas is something like NH3? NH3 has 14 protons (1 from N, 3×1 from H =4; no, wait N has 7, H 1 each. So 7 +3*1=10 p. Neutrons: N-14 has 7 neutrons, H has 0. So 7 + 0 =7. So 10 p and 7 n: not equal.

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Let's think of the reaction itself. The reaction is violent between X and Y, producing gas W and precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point close to 277 K. Let me think, 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. What solid has a melting point around there? Maybe something like ammonium chloride? Or perhaps some other salt.

Wait, another thought: 277 K is about 4°C. Which substance has a melting point near that? Maybe something like water, but water's melting point is 273 K (0°C). Wait, so 277 K is a bit higher, perhaps something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a different substance.

Wait, back to the reaction. The precipitate G forms when X and Y react. When heated, G releases B, whose melting point is around 277 K. If G is something like a carbonate, maybe it decomposes into CO2 and the metal oxide. Alternatively, if G is a hydroxide, heating might release H2O.

Wait, but this might be getting ahead of myself. Let me try to piece it together.

Substance X reacts with Y to form W and G. G when heated gives B. So perhaps the reaction is X + Y → W ↑ + G. Then, G → B when heated.

Let me think about possible reactions. If X is a heavy isotope, maybe it's something like D2O (deuterium oxide, heavy water). Y could be an acid. For example, if Y is an acid like H2SO4, but that might not react violently. Alternatively, maybe Y is a liquid, like concentrated sulfuric acid.

Wait, another angle: if X is D2O and Y is an acid, perhaps a strong acid like H2SO4, the reaction would produce D2 (deuterium gas), but I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, maybe Y is a metal, but that's less likely as Y is a liquid.

Wait, another possibility: Y could be a salt solution. Or perhaps Y is a base. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe X is a heavy isotope of a metal. For example, suppose X is a metal, say, sodium with a heavy isotope. So sodium reacting with Y, perhaps water, producing hydrogen gas (but that's H2, not D2 unless it's heavy water). Wait, but earlier I considered X as D2O, but then Y would have to be something else.

Wait, perhaps X is a heavy isotope of a metal, and Y is a strong acid. For example, sodium metal reacts with water to produce H2 (but as regular H2, unless it's heavy water). But perhaps I'm getting off track.

Let me think about the precipitate G. When heated, it releases B. If G is a carbonate, heating would produce CO2 and the metal oxide. Alternatively, if G is a hydroxide, heating might dehydrate it.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a sulfide or something else.

But perhaps I should focus on the gas W. Let me think again: the gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Earlier, I thought O2 might fit, but let's recalculate. O has atomic number 8, so each O atom has 8 protons. If the isotope is O-16, each has 8 neutrons. So O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons. That fits. So gas W could be O2.

Wait, but O2 is diatomic, so the molecule's protons are 16 (8×2), neutrons 16 (8×2). So yes, equal.

So in that case, the reaction between X and Y produces O2 gas. Then, the reaction is probably between a metal (or its heavy isotope) and an acid, producing O2. But wait, most metals react with acids to produce H2, not O2. Hmm, maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, perhaps X is hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), but no, that's a liquid. Alternatively, perhaps X is something else.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is between a heavy water (X = D2O) and a strong oxidizing acid like conc. H2SO4. But would that produce O2? Let me think: D2O and H2SO4 might not react violently. Alternatively, perhaps it's a reaction where X is a metal and Y is a strong acid, producing H2 gas. But earlier, I thought W was O2, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about W. Let's think of another possibility. What if W is NH3? No, that wouldn't fit because the number of protons and neutrons wouldn't match. Alternatively, maybe CO2? Let's see: CO2 has C (6 p, 6 n if it's C-12) and O (8 p, 8 n if O-16). So each CO2 molecule has 6 +8×2 = 22 protons? Wait, no. Wait, the molecule is C:6 p, O:8 p each. So 6 + (2×8) =22. Neutrons: C:6, O:8 each. So 6 + 2×8=22. So 22 protons and 22 neutrons. So yes, equal. So CO2 could be W.

But would a reaction between X and Y produce CO2? That would require X and Y to have carbon-containing compounds. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe X is a carbonate and Y is an acid, but that would produce CO2.

Wait, but the reaction is violent. Perhaps a decomposition reaction or something else.

Wait, another angle: The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with Substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Hmm, a keto acid is an acid with a ketone group. For example, acetoacetic acid or something similar. When it reacts with X, the product has 2 O atoms. Let me think: if X is a base, perhaps it deprotonates the keto acid, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe X is a reducing agent. Or maybe it's something else.

Wait, another thought: if X is a metal, perhaps it reacts with the keto acid. For example, a metal and a carboxylic acid reacting to form a salt and hydrogen gas. But in this case, the product has 2 O atoms. Hmm, maybe the acid is losing some oxygen. Or perhaps it's a different kind of reaction.

Alternatively, maybe X is something like D2O (deuterium oxide). If the keto acid is something like formic acid (HCOOH), then reacting with D2O might form HOD (deuterium oxide) and DCOOH (deuterated formic acid). But I'm not sure how that would result in a product with 2 O atoms.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is esterification, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the keto acid is reacting with X to form a different compound, but I'm not making much progress here.

Let me circle back to the initial part. Substance X has a heavier isotope, so perhaps it's a compound with a heavy isotope of hydrogen, like D2O. Then, when it reacts with Y, which could be a strong acid, perhaps producing D2 gas. But earlier, I thought W was O2, but maybe another option.

Wait, what if W is D2? So the molecule is D2. Each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So each molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons → equal. So W would be D2. But D2 gas is not as common as H2. But let's see.

So if X is D2O, and Y is a strong acid like H2SO4, perhaps the reaction is:

D2O + H2SO4 → SO2 + H2O + D2↑?

Wait, not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal, say, sodium (but with a heavy isotope), and Y is water. Then the reaction would produce NaOH and H2 gas. But that would be H2, not D2. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: maybe the reaction is a decomposition. For example, maybe X is a peroxide, which when decomposed produces O2. But if X is a heavy isotope, perhaps it's something like H2O2 but with a heavy O isotope.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a heavy isotope of chlorine, but that's less likely given the context.

Wait, another thought: if W is O2, then the reaction could be electrolysis of water. But that's a strong voltage, not necessarily a violent reaction. Alternatively, perhaps a metal reacting with water under certain conditions, like magnesium or something else.

But I'm not making much progress. Let me try to think about the product of the reaction between a keto acid and X. The product has two O atoms. So perhaps X is an oxidizing agent or a reducing agent.

Wait, another idea: if X is NaOH (but that's not a heavy isotope). Alternatively, maybe it's a deuterated compound. If X is D2O, and the keto acid is something like H2CO3 (carbonic acid), which is a keto acid? Wait, no, carbonic acid is H2CO3, which is not a keto acid. Keto acids have a ketone group, like (CH3)2COOH (acetoacetic acid). So if X is D2O, perhaps the reaction is a deuteration, replacing H with D. So the product would have some D atoms, but the O count remains the same.

Wait, the product has 2 O atoms. The keto acid probably has more O atoms. So maybe the reaction is decarboxylation, releasing CO2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the keto acid is reacting with X in a way that removes some O atoms. For example, a dehydration reaction, but that usually forms a double bond, not necessarily reducing O count.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think about the answer options. The options are 35, 25, 31, 29. So the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. Wait, wait, the problem says to calculate the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements' atomic masses in X. So the elements in X must be the lightest and heaviest, and I need their atomic masses summed.

So, what's the possible composition of X?

If X is D2O, then the elements are D (which is H) and O. So the lightest element is H (atomic mass ~1) and the heaviest is O (~16). So sum is 17. But that's not among the options. So that can't be right.

Hmm, then X must contain other elements. Let's think, perhaps X is a compound with a heavier isotope. For example, if X is CH3COOH (acetic acid) with a heavy isotope, perhaps in the CH3 group. But then, the elements are C, H, O. So the lightest is H (1), heaviest is C (12) or O (16). So sum is 1 + 16 =17 again, not matching the options.

Wait, another possibility: X is a metal with a heavy isotope. For example, suppose X is Na, but a heavy isotope like Na-23 (which is the common isotope). Then, the elements in X are just Na. So the lightest and heaviest elements are the same, so sum is 23. 23 isn't in the options either.

Wait, perhaps X is something like NH3, but that's not a heavy isotope. Or maybe it's something else.

Wait, perhaps X is a compound like KCl, where K is a heavy isotope. But K is potassium. Elements would be K and Cl. So lightest is K (39), heaviest Cl (35.5?), but wait, no, Cl is heavier than K (K is ~39, Cl is ~35.5? No, wait, K is about 39, Cl is about 35.5? No, wait, Cl is actually around 35.45, so K is heavier. Wait, no, wait: K is atomic number 19, so its atomic mass is about 39. Cl is atomic number 17, mass about 35.45. So K is heavier than Cl. So elements in X would be K and Cl. So lightest is Cl (35.45) and heaviest is K (39). Sum is approximately 35.45 +39 =74.45. Not matching any options, so that's unlikely.

Hmm. Maybe X is something else. Let me think of another approach. The problem says that when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product contains 2 atoms of oxygen. So the keto acid must have more than 2 O atoms, and the reaction reduces that number.

Wait, a keto acid is an acid with a ketone group. For example, acetoacetic acid is HC(O)CH2COOH. It has 4 O atoms. If the reaction with X produces a compound with 2 O atoms, perhaps it's losing two O atoms. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a decarboxylation, where a CO2 is released, reducing the oxygen count. Let's see: acetoacetic acid (4 O) losing CO2 (which has 2 O) would leave 2 O. So the product would have 2 O atoms. That makes sense.

So if X is a base, maybe it's a strong base like NaOH, which could deprotonate the keto acid and lead to decarboxylation.

Wait, but the initial part says X has a heavier isotope. So if X is NaOH, perhaps it's D2O (but that's a different compound). Hmm.

Wait, alternatively, maybe X is a reducing agent like sodium borohydride, but that's not a liquid.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think again about the precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, whose melting point is ~277 K (about 4°C). What solid has a melting point around there? Maybe ammonium nitrate? Wait, no, its melting point is higher. Alternatively, maybe something like camphor? No, that's higher. Wait, another thought: Maybe B is water, which melts at 273 K (0°C). But the question says 277 K, which is a bit higher. That might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps B is ice, but that's 273 K.

Wait, perhaps B is a different form of water, like heavy water, but heavy water's melting point is slightly higher than regular water (~3.8°C, which is ~276.9 K). Oh, that's very close to 277 K. So B could be D2O (heavy water), which has a melting point around 3.8°C (276.9 K), which is very close to 277 K.

So if heating G releases B (D2O), then G could be a hydrate or a compound that, upon heating, loses some components and leaves D2O.

Wait, but D2O is a liquid, not a precipitate. Hmm, maybe G is a hydrate that, when heated, releases water. Wait, no, because B is D2O. So when G is heated, it releases D2O, which would mean G is a deuterated hydrate. But that's a bit unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a carbonate, which upon heating decomposes into CO2 and a metal oxide. But then B would be CO2, which doesn't fit the melting point.

Wait, maybe B is a metal oxide, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

If B is D2O, then when G is heated, it produces D2O. So G is probably a compound that, upon heating, loses other components and leaves D2O. For example, if G is a deuterated hydroxide, like Mg(OH)D, but that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a sulfide that, when heated, produces D2O. Not sure.

Wait, let's think of a reaction where X is D2O. Then, when X reacts with Y (maybe an acid), it might produce D2 gas. But earlier I thought W could be D2, which fits the neutron and proton condition.

So let's outline this:

X is D2O (heavy water). Y is an acid, perhaps H2SO4. The reaction between D2O and H2SO4 might produce D2 gas, sulfuric acid, and water.

Wait, but the reaction equation would be something like:

D2O + H2SO4 → SO2↑ + 2 H2O + D2↑ ?

Not sure about the products. Alternatively, maybe it's a more straightforward reaction, like D2O with a strong acid producing D2 gas. For example:

D2O + H2SO4 → H2SO4 (diluted) + D2↑ ?

But I'm not certain about the stoichiometry.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a metal, but Y is a liquid, so maybe it's mercury. But that would be a different reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a base. For example, if Y is a strong base like NaOH, then D2O and NaOH wouldn't react much. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps Y is a liquid like concentrated H2SO4, and X is D2O. The reaction could be:

D2O + H2SO4 → SO2↑ + 2 H2O + D2↑ ?

But I'm not sure if that's a correct reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is D2O with a metal, but metals are solids, not liquids.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a liquid non-metal, like sulfur or something else. I'm not making progress here.

Let me try to think of the elements in X. If X is D2O, the elements are D (which is H) and O. So the lightest element is H (mass ~1), the heaviest is O (~16). Sum is 17, which is not an option. So X can't be D2O. That suggests I'm on the wrong track.

Hmm. Maybe X is a different compound. Let's think of another possibility. What if X is something like NH3 with a heavy isotope. But NH3 is a liquid under certain conditions, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: if W is O2, then the reaction produces O2. So what reactions produce O2? Decomposition of H2O2, electrolysis of water, or perhaps the reaction of a metal with water under certain conditions (like Mg or something reactive).

But if X is a heavy isotope, perhaps the reaction is between a heavy water (D2O) and a metal that reacts violently with it to produce O2. But I don't think that's common; metals typically produce H2 when reacting with water, not O2.

Wait, another angle: The product of the reaction between a keto acid and X has 2 O atoms. Let's think of a keto acid like acetoacetic acid (CH3COCH2COOH). If it reacts with X to form a product with 2 O atoms, perhaps it's decarboxylation, which would lose CO2 (2 O) and leave something else with 2 O.

Wait, acetoacetic acid has four O atoms. If it loses two O atoms as CO2, the product would have 2 O atoms. So perhaps the reaction is a decarboxylation, possibly catalyzed by X.

But what would cause decarboxylation? Often, heat or a base. If X is a base, perhaps it deprotonates the keto acid, leading to decarboxylation.

Wait, but the question says that the product has 2 O atoms. So the product could be something like CH3COCH3 (acetone), which has three O atoms. Hmm, no, that's three. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different product.

Alternatively, maybe the keto acid is reacting with X to form a different compound, such as an ester or something else. But I'm not certain.

Another thought: perhaps X is a reducing agent. If the keto acid is being reduced, that could change the O count. For example, reducing a keto group to an alcohol would add H but not change O count much. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is esterification, but that typically doesn't change the O count.

Hmm, I'm going around in circles. Maybe I should try to think of the possible answer based on the options given. The options are 35, 25, 31, 29. These are all sums of two atomic masses. So what pairs of elements sum to these numbers?

Let me list some atomic masses:

- H: ~1
- C: ~12
- N: ~14
- O: ~16
- F: ~19
- Na: ~23
- Mg: ~24
- Al: ~27
- S: ~32
- Cl: ~35.5
- K: ~39
- Ca: ~40
- etc.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 35: Maybe 16 (O) + 19 (F) = 35. Or 14 (N) + 21 (something else? But 21 isn't an atomic mass I know.)

Option B) 25: Could be 1 (H) + 24 (Mg) =25. Or 12 (C) +13 (Al? No, Al is 27). Or 23 (Na) +2 (H) =25.

Option C) 31: Could be 16 (O) +15 (P? No, P is ~31). Alternatively, 12 (C) +19 (F) =31. Or 14 (N) +17 (Cl? No, 17 is Cl's atomic number, but mass is ~35). Wait, 14 + 17 is 31, but 17 is Cl's atomic number, but its atomic mass is ~35.5. Hmm.

Option D) 29: Could be 1 (H) + 28 (Si? No, Si is ~28). Or 12 (C) +17 (Cl? No). Or 16 (O) +13 (Al? No). Alternatively, 23 (Na) +6 (C) =29. Hmm.

So looking for pairs that sum to the options. For example:

Option D (29): Na (23) + C (6) → 23+6=29. So if X has elements Na and C, their atomic masses sum to 29.

But what compound has Na and C? Sodium carbide? Or perhaps sodium carbonate? Wait, sodium carbonate is Na2CO3, which has Na, C, O.

Wait, but X is a substance that incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So sodium could have a heavier isotope, say, Na-25 instead of Na-23. But then the elements would be Na and C and O.

Wait, but the question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X. So in the case of sodium carbonate, the elements are Na, C, O. The lightest would be C (12) and the heaviest O (16). Sum is 28. Not matching any options.

Alternatively, if X is something like NaH (sodium hydride), then elements are Na and H. Sum is 23 +1=24, which is option B (25 is close but not exact). Hmm, 24 isn't an option.

Wait, another possibility: if X is CH3COOH (acetic acid) with a heavy isotope. The elements are C, H, O. Lightest H (1), heaviest O (16). Sum is 17. Not an option.

Wait, what about X being H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide) with a heavy isotope. Elements are H and O. Sum is 1 +16=17 again.

Hmm. Let me think again of the possible compounds.

Wait, another thought: if X is a metal with a heavy isotope, like potassium (K) with a heavy isotope, but the other element is something else. But K is heavier than O, so perhaps the other element is something lighter.

Alternatively, if X is KCN (potassium cyanide), then elements are K, C, N. Lightest is C (12), heaviest K (39). Sum is 12+39=51, not an option.

Wait, perhaps X is a diatomic molecule. For example, Cl2, but that's not incorporating a heavier isotope. Or maybe it's something else.

Wait, the problem states that X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So perhaps one of its atoms is a heavy isotope, and others are regular.

Wait, perhaps X is something like CHCl3, where Cl has a heavier isotope. The elements are C, H, Cl. Lightest is H (1), heaviest Cl (35.5). Sum is 1+35.5=36.5, which is close to option A (35). But not exact.

Alternatively, if X is CH2Cl2, elements are C, H, Cl. Sum 1+35.5=36.5 again.

Hmm, but the options don't have 36.5. The closest is option A:35.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a molecule with elements O and Cl. For example, ClO2. Then, elements are Cl and O. Lightest O (16), heaviest Cl (35.5). Sum is 51.5. Not matching.

Hmm. Another approach: Which elements sum to the options given?

Looking at option D: 29. Possible pairs:

- Na (23) + C (6) → 29.

So if X contains Na and C, their sum is 29. So possible elements in X are Na and C.

What's a compound with Na and C? Sodium carbide (NaC), but that's not common. More likely, sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), but that includes O as well. Alternatively, sodium cyanide (NaCN), which has Na, C, N.

Wait, but the problem states that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one element. So perhaps one of the atoms is a heavy isotope, like a heavy carbon isotope (C-13 or C-14), but that's negligible in mass.

Alternatively, perhaps the heavier isotope is in the sodium, like Na-25 instead of Na-23.

So if X is NaCN, elements are Na, C, N. The lightest element is C (12) and the heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 12 +23=35. Wait, 35 is option A.

Wait, but wait, the question says the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements. So if X is NaCN, lightest is C (12), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 35, which is option A.

But earlier I thought that the product of the reaction with the keto acid has 2 O atoms. Hmm, I'm not sure if that fits, but this seems to lead me to option A.

Alternatively, if X is NaOH, which has Na, O, H. But then the lightest is H (1), heaviest O (16). Sum 17, not an option.

Wait, let me think again about the product of the reaction between X and the keto acid. If X is NaCN, and the keto acid is something like CH3COOH, perhaps the reaction is nucleophilic substitution, but I'm not sure how that would result in a product with 2 O atoms.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I should proceed with the information I have and see which option makes sense.

If X's constituent elements are Na and C, sum is 23 +12=35, which is option A.

But the other part of the problem says that when heated, precipitate G releases B with a melting point close to 277 K. If B is D2O (heavy water), which has a melting point around 277 K, then perhaps G is a deuterated compound that upon heating releases D2O.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something else. Let me think of another angle. The product of the reaction between X and the keto acid has 2 O atoms. Let's think of a keto acid like glyoxylic acid (O=C(OH)-COOH?), but I'm not certain.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the reaction is a dehydration. For example, a keto acid losing a water molecule, which would remove one H2O, reducing the O count by one. So if the keto acid originally has 3 O atoms, the product would have 2. But that's just a guess.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a decarboxylation, losing CO2 (2 O), going from, say, 4 O to 2 O.

Wait, but if X is a base like NaOH, reacting with a keto acid could deprotonate it, leading to the formation of a carboxylate, which might eliminate CO2 upon heating, leaving a ketone with fewer O.

But I'm not certain.

Hmm. I think I've spent a lot of time on this, but I'm not entirely confident. Based on the earlier analysis, if the elements in X are Na and C, their sum is 35, which is option A. But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Alternatively, another option could be if X contains Cl and H. For example, if X is HCl with a heavier isotope (like Cl-35), elements are H and Cl. Sum is 1 +35.5=36.5, which is close to option A (35). But 36.5 isn't an option, so perhaps that's not it.

Hmm. Another thought: if X is NH3 with a heavy isotope, like D, then elements are N and H. Sum is 14 +1=15, not an option.

Wait, another possibility: X is a diatomic molecule like O2 with a heavy isotope. But then the elements are O, sum is 16, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps X is a compound with elements O and S. For example, SO2. Then, lightest O (16), heaviest S (32). Sum is 48, not an option.

Another angle: the problem says X especially its close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. A common reagent is NaOH, but X is a heavy isotope, perhaps D2O. Alternatively, maybe it's something like DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide), but I'm not sure.

Hmm. I'm going to have to make an educated guess. The most plausible option seems to be option D (29), but earlier I thought about 23 +6=29. Alternatively, option A (35) from Na (23) and Cl (12?), but that doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: If X is something like CHCl3, with Cl being a heavier isotope. The elements are C, H, Cl. Sum of lightest (H:1) and heaviest (Cl:35.5) is 36.5, which is close to option A (35). Perhaps the problem uses rounded numbers, so 35 would be the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound with elements C and O. Like CO, but that's a gas. Or CO2. Then sum is 12 +16=28, not an option.

Wait, another way: if X is a metal with a heavy isotope, like lead. But lead's atomic mass is much higher.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Since I think the sum is 35, I'll go with option A.

The problem involves identifying the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Reaction Overview**: Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W and forming precipitate G. Gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. The precipitate G, when heated, releases B, a substance with a melting point close to 277 K (approximately 4°C). This suggests B could be heavy water (D₂O), as its melting point is around 3.8°C.

2. **Gas W**: The molecule of W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Possible candidates include O₂ (16 protons and 16 neutrons) or D₂ (2 protons and 2 neutrons). However, D₂ is less common, so O₂ is a plausible candidate.

3. **Precipitate G**: When heated, G releases B (likely D₂O). This suggests G could be a deuterated compound that loses other components upon heating, leaving D₂O.

4. **Reaction with Keto Acid**: The product of the reaction between a keto acid and X contains 2 oxygen atoms. This implies a reaction such as decarboxylation, where a keto acid loses CO₂, reducing the oxygen count from 4 to 2. For example, acetoacetic acid (HC(O)CH₂COOH) could lose CO₂ to form a compound with 2 oxygen atoms.

5. **Elements in X**: Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. Possible candidates for X include compounds like NaCN, where the elements are sodium (Na) and carbon (C). Sodium has an atomic mass of ~23, and carbon has an atomic mass of ~12. The sum of the lightest (C) and heaviest (Na) elements is 12 + 23 = 35.

6. **Options Analysis**:
   - **Option A (35)**: Matches the sum of the atomic masses of carbon (12) and sodium (23) in NaCN.
   - **Option B (25)**: Could correspond to hydrogen (1) and magnesium (24), but this does not fit the context of X.
   - **Option C (31)**: Could correspond to oxygen (16) and nitrogen (15), but this is less likely.
   - **Option D (29)**: Could correspond to sodium (23) and carbon (6), but this is inconsistent with the atomic mass of carbon.

Based on the analysis, the most plausible answer is **Option A (35)**, as it aligns with the elements in X (Na and C) and their cumulative atomic masses.
