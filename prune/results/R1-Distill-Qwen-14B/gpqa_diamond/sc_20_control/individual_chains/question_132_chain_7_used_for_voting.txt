Okay, let me try to work through this NMR problem. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step. The question is about identifying two aromatic compounds in a mixture based on their NMR spectra. 

So the molecular formula is C10H14. That suggests each compound is an aromatic ring with substituents. Let me think about the options first. The options are four different tetramethylbenzenes and one diethylbenzene.

The NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm. Each is a singlet, which usually means no neighboring protons. In aromatic regions, singlets typically come from equivalent protons with no adjacent H's. 

Additionally, there are three singlets at 2.2 ppm, in a 2:1:1 ratio. Singlets here suggest no neighboring protons, so maybe CH3 groups attached to something that doesn't have protons adjacent, like an aromatic ring or another methyl group.

Let me think about each option's structure and their expected NMR signals.

First, the aromatic region. Each compound is a tetramethylbenzene, which would have the benzene ring with four methyl groups. Alternatively, diethyl would be two ethyl groups, but that's another option.

Wait, the problem says it's a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds. So each compound contributes to certain signals.

Looking at the aromatic signals: two singlets at 6.7 ppm, each a singlet, 1:1 ratio. So each compound probably has a set of equivalent aromatic protons that are each a singlet. Alternatively, each might have a different number of protons, but they average into two signals.

Wait, no. Wait, the total NMR shows two signals. So each compound contributes some protons, but perhaps in each compound, the aromatic protons are split into two sets, but in the mixture, they average into two signals. Or maybe each compound has only one set of aromatic protons. Hmm.

Wait, the question says the 1H NMR spectrum has two signals in the aromatic region. So each compound would contribute their own set of aromatic protons, but perhaps they are similar enough to result in two signals. Or perhaps each compound has only one set of aromatic protons, but in the mixture, the two sets sum to two signals.

Wait, but the options are four tetramethylbenzenes and one diethyl. Let's consider each.

First, consider 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene. Let's draw that. The benzene ring with methyl groups at positions 1,2,4,5. So the structure would have two methyl groups adjacent (1 and 2) and another two adjacent (4 and5). Wait, but that would make the ring look like it has two para positions occupied. Actually, perhaps it's 1,2,4,5; so positions 1,2 are adjacent, then 4,5 are adjacent, but 2 and 4 are across from each other. Maybe it's a meta arrangement? Wait, perhaps it's better to number the ring.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think about the symmetry of each structure. For instance, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene would be a ring where every other carbon has a methyl group. Wait, no, that would be 1,2,3,4. No, wait, benzene is six-membered. So 1,2,3,4 would be four consecutive positions, which is not possible because in a ring. Wait, that can't happen; four consecutive positions would be in a row, but benzene is a ring, so 1,2,3,4 would be four adjacent positions, but that's actually not possible because six positions in a ring. Hmm, perhaps 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is actually 1,2,3,4 positions, which would make the structure have two meta pairs. Hmm, not sure. Maybe I should think about the number of unique hydrogen environments in each structure.

Let's take each option one by one.

Option A: 1,2,3,4 and 1,2,3,5.

Wait, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. Let me imagine the structure. The ring would have methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4. That would mean positions 5 and 6 are empty. The symmetry here? Well, with four methyl groups in a row, the structure would have some symmetry. Wait, actually, when four substituents are in consecutive positions, the molecule would have certain symmetry. Let me think about the possible equivalent protons.

In 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, the ring would have two empty positions: 5 and 6. So the substituents are at 1,2,3,4. So 5 and 6 are para to each other. The protons in position 5 and 6 would be equivalent? No, because position 5 is adjacent to 4 (methyl) and position 6 is adjacent to 1 (methyl). Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, no, in a benzene ring, each position is adjacent to two others. So if 1,2,3,4 have methyl, then positions 5 and 6 are each next to 4 and 1 respectively. Wait, position 5 is next to 4 and 6. So 5's adjacent are 4 and 6, which both are next to methyl groups. Wait, but 6 is adjacent to 5 and to 1, which is methyl. So perhaps the protons on 5 and 6 are equivalent? Because the structure is symmetric. Let me think about the entire molecule.

The molecule 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene would have methyl groups at 1,2,3,4. So positions 5 and 6 are each adjacent to two methyl groups. But since the molecule is symmetric, perhaps positions 5 and 6 are equivalent, and their protons would be a singlet. So the aromatic region would have a singlet integrating for two H, but wait—if each ring carbon only has one substituent, wait, no. Wait, each hydrogen in the ring is attached to a carbon that has a methyl group? No, wait, the substituents are at 1,2,3,4, but 5 and 6 are empty.

Wait no, wait, the substituents are methyl groups on carbons 1,2,3,4, so the remaining carbons (5 and 6) each have hydrogen atoms. So in this structure, the hydrogen atoms would be on 5 and 6. Are these equivalent?

Yes, because the molecule is symmetric with a plane of symmetry between positions 1 and 4, and 2 and 3. So the H at 5 and 6 would be equivalent. Therefore, their NMR signal would be a singlet, integrating for two H.

Similarly, for 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. Let's see. The substituents are at 1,2,3,5. So positions 4 and 6 are empty. The symmetry here would be lower. Let me visualize: the substituents are at 1,2,3,5. So the empty positions are 4 and 6.

Wait, in this structure, position 4 is adjacent to 3 (methyl) and 5 (methyl), and position 6 is adjacent to 5 (methyl) and 1 (methyl). Hmm, so the H on 4 and 6— are they equivalent?

In this case, the molecule might not be symmetric. Let me think: the substituents are at 1,2,3,5. So looking at the ring, from position 1 to 2 to 3 to 4 to 5 to 6. So substituents at 1,2,3,5. Positions 4 and 6 are empty.

Is there a symmetry here? If we rotate the ring 120 degrees, would it look the same? Probably not. So the H at 4 and 6 might not be equivalent. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a mirror plane. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps considering that the substituents are at 1,2,3,5, which would make the molecule perhaps have an axis of symmetry. Alternatively, maybe not. So in this case, the H on position 4 and 6 might be in different environments.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged such that the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, positions 1 and 5 are both methyl, 2 and 3 are methyl. So maybe the mirror plane is through the middle between 4 and 6. Hmm.

Wait, if I imagine the ring as a hexagon, with substituents at positions 1,2,3,5, then positions 6 and 4 are both H. Let me think about whether 4 and 6 are equivalent. If I draw a mirror line between 4 and 6, would the substituents mirror each other? 1 and 5 are on either side of the mirror line. 2 and 3 are also on one side. So perhaps no, because 2 and 3 are both on the same side, making positions 4 and 6 not equivalent.

So, the H on 4 and 6 would be in different environments, so each would have a different chemical shift.

Wait, but in that case, the NMR would show two signals from the aromatic region. But in our problem, the aromatic region has two singlets. So each compound contributes one singlet each, making two signals in total. So each of the two compounds in the mixture has only one set of aromatic protons, each as a singlet.

So, for each compound, the aromatic protons must be a singlet, meaning all equivalent and no adjacent H's.

Wait, but in our options, each compound is a tetramethylbenzene, so four methyl groups. So the aromatic ring has four methyl substituents and two hydrogen substituents? Or wait, benzene has six carbons. So tetramethyl would have four methyl groups on the ring, leaving two carbons with H.

Wait, but each of those two carbons would have H's. So the question is whether those H's are equivalent.

So let's go back to each option.

Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Wait, 1,2,4,5-tetramethyl. So substituents at 1,2,4,5. So the empty positions are 3 and 6.

Are H3 and H6 equivalent?

Let me imagine the structure. Positions 1,2,4,5 have methyl. So position 3 is between 2 and 4, both methyl. Position 6 is between 5 and 1, both methyl. So H3 and H6 are each adjacent to two methyl groups. Are they equivalent?

In this case, the structure might be symmetric. Because if you look at the substituents, 1 and 5 are opposite each other (since benzene is a ring), and 2 and 4 are also opposite. So the substituents at 1,2,4,5 are arranged symmetrically. So, the H3 and H6 would be equivalent. Therefore, each would have the same chemical shift, leading to a singlet integrating for two H.

So, in the NMR, the aromatic region would show a singlet for each compound. So if the mixture is of two such compounds, each contributing a singlet, but perhaps with different shifts, the total would be two signals.

Wait, but the problem says two signals at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. So each singlet would have about the same integration, since it's a 1:1 mixture. Hmm, but each compound would have two H's, so the integration for each compound's aromatic signal would be 2 H. So in the mixture (1:1), the total would be 2 H each, so the ratio of the two signals would be 1:1. So in the NMR, each would be a singlet with 2 H, but perhaps at different ppm shifts. So that's two singlets in the aromatic region.

Wait, but the problem says two signals at around 6.7 ppm. So maybe both of their aromatic signals are around 6.7 ppm, but perhaps not exactly the same, but close enough to present as two signals.

Now, let's consider the other part of the NMR: three signals at 2.2 ppm, all singlets, in a 2:1:1 ratio. So that's a total of four H (since 2+1+1=4). But wait, each CH3 group contributes 3 H, so the integration would be 3 H per group. Wait, but the ratio is 2:1:1. So perhaps two different types of CH3 groups, one in a 2:1:1 ratio.

Wait, wait. The integrated area is 2:1:1, which sums to 4 parts. So each part would be 3 H? No, because each CH3 is 3 H. Wait, perhaps that's not the case. Let me think. The area under each peak is proportional to the number of H's. So if the peaks are at 2.2 ppm, singlets, and the ratio is 2:1:1, that would mean the first is 2 parts, and the other two are 1 part each. So the total number of H in the methyl groups is 2 +1 +1 =4 H. But each CH3 has 3 H. Hmm, that's confusing. Unless some of the CH3 groups are split into multiple signals, but the question says all are singlets.

Wait, maybe the 2.2 ppm signals are from different types of methyl groups. Let me think.

If one of the compounds has two types of methyl groups, and the other has one, then in the mixture, perhaps the integration adds up.

For example, if one compound has two equivalent methyl groups (so they'd contribute as one singlet) and another has two different methyl groups (so two singlets), then in the mixture, the total would be three singlets. But the ratio would be based on how many H each contributes.

Wait, the ratio is 2:1:1, so total of 4 parts. Each part is 3 H? No, that would be 12 H, which can't be because each compound has four methyl groups (C10H14: each compound is C10H14. Wait, wait, the molecular formula for each compound is C10H14? Let's check.

Wait, molecular formula is C10H14. Benzene is C6H6. Each methyl is CH3, so four methyl groups: 4*(CH3) = C4H12. So C6H6 + C4H12 → C10H18. But the formula is C10H14. Hmm, that's a problem. Oh wait, wait, the molecular formula given is C10H14 for each compound. So perhaps each compound is a dimethyl substituent? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, wait, no, because tetramethylbenzene would be C6H5(CH3)4. Let me calculate.

Benzene is C6H6. Each methyl is CH3. So for tetramethyl, it's C6H6 + 4*(CH3) → C6+4= C10, H6 + 4*3= H18. So the formula would be C10H18. But the question says C10H14. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. So perhaps the compounds are not tetramethylbenzenes, but something else. Wait, but the options given include 1,4-diethylbenzene.

Ah, okay, diethyl would be C6H5-C2H5-CH2CH3? No, wait, diethyl is two ethyl groups. Each ethyl is -CH2CH3. So two ethyl groups would add C4H10. So the formula would be C6H5 + C4H10 → C10H15. But the question says C10H14. Hmm, that's still one H off. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structures have rings with substitutions that reduce the number of H. For example, if some positions are taken by substituents, maybe the ring is more substituted.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate.

Each option is C10H14. Let me think about each structure.

For tetramethylbenzene: C6H5(CH3)4. So that's 6 carbons in benzene, plus four CH3 groups. So 6 +4 =10 C. For H: benzene has 6 H. Each CH3 has 3 H, so 4*3=12. 6 +12=18 H. But the formula is C10H14. So tetramethylbenzene would have C10H18. But the question states C10H14. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the options are not all tetramethylbenzenes. Let me look again.

The options are:

1) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene → C10H14? Wait, that can't be, as above.

Wait, maybe the substituents are not all methyl. Let me think again. Oh, wait, one of the options is 1,4-diethylbenzene. Diethyl would be two ethyl groups. Each ethyl is C2H5. So two ethyl groups: 2*(C2H5) = C4H10. Benzene is C6H6. So total is C10H16. But the formula is C10H14. Hmm, so that doesn't add up either.

Wait, maybe the substituents are something else. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are not all methyl or ethyl. Wait, but the question's options only give tetramethyl and diethyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in positions that lead to some H being lost. For instance, if the substituents are in a way that makes the molecule more substituted, perhaps the ring is less hydrogenated? No, benzene is already fully unsaturated.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the NMR data again.

The aromatic region has two singlets, each as a singlet, 1:1. The aliphatic region has three singlets at 2.2 ppm, ratio 2:1:1.

Wait, the aliphatic signals: singlets. So each CH3 group is not split by neighboring H's. So each CH3 is attached to something that doesn't have adjacent H's. So CH3 in a position where the adjacent carbons don't have H's, perhaps attached to the ring or another CH3.

In the options, some have multiple methyl groups in different positions.

Let me think about each option's possible methyl groups and their environments.

Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

So the first compound has methyl groups at 1,2,4,5. The second has methyl groups at 1,2,3,5.

Each compound would have four methyl groups.

Wait, but in the mixture, each compound contributes their own set of methyl groups. So in the NMR, the methyl signals would be from both.

But the problem states that the aliphatic region has three singlets. So perhaps each compound contributes some methyl groups that are equivalent, and the other contributes others.

Alternatively, the diethyl option would have ethyl groups. Let me think about that.

Wait, 1,4-diethylbenzene: substituents at 1 and 4 are ethyl groups. So each ethyl is -CH2CH3. The ethyl groups are in para positions. So each ethyl would have neighboring CH2 and CH3 groups. The protons on the CH2 would be split by the adjacent CH3. Wait, but the NMR shows singlets in the aliphatic region. So ethyl groups' CH2 would not be singlets; they would be split into multiplets. So perhaps diethylbenzene is not part of the solution, because the aliphatic signals are singlets.

So perhaps the diethyl option is not the correct one, which rules out option C, which includes diethylbenzene.

So now, looking back, the correct mixture must consist of two tetramethylbenzenes.

Each tetramethylbenzene has four methyl groups, but perhaps some of them are equivalent, leading to fewer signals.

Wait, the aliphatic region has three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. So perhaps one compound contributes two equivalent methyl groups (one singlet) and the other contributes two different methyl groups (two singlets), but each is present in 1:1 ratio in the mixture.

Wait, but 2:1:1 is three peaks, and the ratio is 2:1:1. So maybe one of the compounds has two equivalent CH3 groups (so a singlet integrating for 2*3=6 H?), and the other has two different CH3 groups (each integrating for 3 H). But in a 1:1 mixture, the total would be 6+3+3 = 12 H. But the molecular formula is C10H14, so each compound has 14 H.

Wait, let me think about each compound's structure and how many unique methyl groups they have.

Let's take 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene. The substituents are at 1,2,4,5. So the methyl groups at 1 and 2 are adjacent, and 4 and 5 are adjacent. Are the methyl groups at 1 and 5 equivalent? Let me think: if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, perhaps the methyl groups at 1 and 5 are equivalent, and similarly 2 and 4 are equivalent.

Wait, in 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, the substituents are at positions 1,2,4,5. So each of these positions has a methyl group. Now, are the methyl groups at 1 and 5 equivalent? Let's imagine the ring. If I rotate the structure 180 degrees, 1 swaps with 4, and 2 swaps with 5. So, if the substituents are at 1,2,4,5, then after 180 rotation, substituents are at 4,5,1,2. So the structure is identical, implying that the methyl groups at 1 and 4 are equivalent, and those at 2 and 5 are equivalent.

Wait, but in that case, the methyl groups at 1 and 4 are the same, and so are 2 and 5. So each pair would be equivalent, meaning there are two types of methyl groups: one set (1 and 4) and another set (2 and 5). So in the NMR, each would appear as a singlet, but split into two signals. Wait, but each pair is equivalent, so each pair would be a singlet. So for this compound, the NMR would show two singlets in the aliphatic region.

Similarly, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. The substituents are at 1,2,3,5. Let's see if any of the methyl groups are equivalent. Let's imagine the ring: substituents at 1,2,3,5. So 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6. 2 is adjacent to 1 and 3. 3 is adjacent to 2 and 4. 5 is adjacent to 4 and 6.

Hmm, does this structure have any symmetry? If I rotate the ring, would any substituents swap places? Let's see. For instance, if I rotate by 120 degrees, substituents would move to different positions. It's unclear if there's any symmetry here. Perhaps the methyl groups at 1 and 5 are in different environments, as are 2 and 3. So in this case, each methyl group may be unique, leading to four different methyl groups. But that can't be right because that would give four signals, which doesn't match the NMR data.

Wait, but perhaps some are equivalent. For example, the methyl groups at 1 and 5: are they equivalent?

In 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, the substituents are 1,2,3,5. The molecule's symmetry might have a mirror plane. Let me think: if I draw a mirror line from 4 to 6, perhaps. Then substituent 1 would mirror to 5, and substituent 2 would mirror to 3. So in that case, the methyl groups at 1 and 5 are equivalent, and those at 2 and 3 are equivalent. So the NMR would show two singlets for the methyl groups.

So, each of the two compounds in the mixture would have two types of methyl groups, each as a singlet.

Therefore, in the mixture, each compound contributes two singlets, but perhaps one of the compounds' methyl groups are overlapping with the other's.

Wait, but the NMR shows three singlets. How?

Suppose compound A has two types of methyl groups (singlets at 2.2 ppm), and compound B has two types, but one matches one of A's. So in the mixture, the total would be three singlets.

Wait, let's think about this. Suppose in the mixture, one of the compounds has two methyl signals, and the other has two, but one of them is the same as one in the first. Then the total would be three.

Alternatively, perhaps one compound has two equivalent methyl groups (so one signal), and the other has two different types (two signals). Then the mixture would have three.

So, for the aliphatic region:

- Compound X has one type of methyl group (so one singlet, integrating for 6 H if two groups).
- Compound Y has two types of methyl groups, each integrating for 3 H.

In a 1:1 mixture, the total would be:

- From X: 6 H (singlet)
- From Y: 3 H and 3 H (two singlets)

But the observed ratio is 2:1:1, which sums to 4 parts. But the actual H from each would be 6 (from X) +3 +3 =12 H. The ratio 2:1:1 would imply 8 H (2+1+1=4, but multiplied by 2 perhaps). Hmm, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, the ratio is 2:1:1, which adds up to 4. So each part is 3 H? Because 2 parts would be 6 H, 1 part 3 H, etc. But in the NMR, each signal's area is proportional to the number of H's. So a 2:1:1 ratio would be, for example, one peak integrating for 6 H (2 parts), and two peaks for 3 H each (1 part each).

So if in the aliphatic region, the first peak is 6 H, and the other two are 3 H each, that would fit the 2:1:1 ratio.

So which compound would contribute a singlet of 6 H (i.e., two equivalent CH3 groups), and the other would contribute two singlets, each 3 H.

So, which of the compounds have two equivalent methyl groups?

Looking back, 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has two pairs of equivalent methyl groups: 1 and 4 (each CH3), and 2 and 5 (each CH3). So for this compound, the NMR would show two singlets in the aliphatic region.

Similarly, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene has two pairs of equivalent methyl groups: 1 and 5, and 2 and 3. So this would also show two singlets.

But if the mixture is of 1,2,4,5 and 1,2,3,5, then each contributes two singlets. But perhaps one of the singlets overlaps.

So, in the mixture, the NMR would show:

- Singlet from 1,2,4,5's pair 1 and 4 (let's say this is a singlet at 2.2 ppm, integrating for 6 H)
- Singlet from 1,2,4,5's pair 2 and 5 (another singlet, 6 H)
- Singlet from 1,2,3,5's pair 1 and 5 (another singlet, 6 H)
- Singlet from 1,2,3,5's pair 2 and 3 (another singlet, 6 H)

But that would give four signals, which is more than what's observed (three). So that can't be the case.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the number of signals each compound contributes. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the compounds has two methyl groups that are equivalent and located symmetrically, while the other has two pairs of methyl groups that are not equivalent. Or perhaps one compound has three equivalent methyl groups and one unique, but that's not tetramethyl.

Wait, maybe I should think about each compound's methyl groups:

1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: methyl at 1 and 4 (equivalent), and at 2 and 5 (equivalent). So two signals.

1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: methyl at 1 and 5 (equivalent), and at 2 and 3 (equivalent). So two signals.

So the mixture would have four signals in the aliphatic region, but the NMR only shows three. So perhaps one of the signals overlaps. For example, if the singlet from 1,2,4,5's 1 and 4 is the same as the singlet from 1,2,3,5's 1 and 5.

Wait, that would require that the chemical shifts are the same. So if both 1,2,4,5's 1 and 4 methyl groups and 1,2,3,5's 1 and 5 methyl groups are at the same shift, then in the NMR, they would add up. So the singlet would integrate for 6 +6 =12 H.

But the observed ratio is 2:1:1, which sums to 4 parts. So the total aliphatic integration would be 12 H (for the methyl groups) plus any other H's, but maybe the aromatic H's are 4 H in total.

Wait, the problem says the aliphatic signals are three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. So 2 parts, 1 part, 1 part. Let's say the first is 6 H (two CH3 groups), and the other two are 3 H each. That would fit.

If in the mixture, one compound contributes a singlet of 6 H (two CH3 groups), and the other contributes two singlets of 3 H each, then the total is three signals with ratio 2:1:1.

So, which compounds would do that?

Looking back, 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has two pairs: one pair is at positions 1 and 4, the other at 2 and 5.

If the 1 and 4 CH3 groups are in a different environment than the 2 and 5, their shifts would be different. So this compound would contribute two singlets, say a and b.

Similarly, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene has methyl groups at 1 and 5 (a'), and 2 and 3 (b').

If in the mixture, the a and a' are similar enough to overlap, then the total would be a singlet integrating to 12 H (6 from each), plus the other two singlets b and b', each 6 H. But that would give three signals, but their ratio would be 12:6:6, which simplifies to 2:1:1. That fits the data.

So, in this case, the two compounds would have their 1 and 4 (a and a') methyl groups overlapping, and their 2 and 5 (b and b') as separate.

Wait, but 1,2,4,5's 2 and 5 methyl groups would be in a different environment than 1,2,3,5's 2 and 3. So their shifts would be different, leading to separate signals.

So, in the mixture, the 1 and 4 signals (a and a') would be same, so a singlet with 12 H (from both compounds). The 2 and 5 (from first) and 2 and 3 (from second) would each contribute 6 H, but if their chemical shifts are different, we would have three signals: 12 H (a+a'), 6 H (b), and 6 H (b'). But the observed ratio is 2:1:1, which would correspond to 8 H, 4 H, and 4 H. Hmm, no, that doesn't match. So I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, maybe the 1,2,4,5 compound has two methyl groups (at 1 and 4) that are equivalent, giving a singlet of 6 H. The 1,2,3,5 compound has two methyl groups (1 and 5) that are equivalent, giving another singlet of 6 H. But if these two singlets are the same shift, they'd combine into a singlet of 12 H. Then the other two methyl groups (2 and 5 in 1,2,4,5; and 2 and 3 in 1,2,3,5) would each be separate signals of 6 H each. But that would give three signals: 12 H, 6 H, 6 H. The ratio would be 12:6:6 → 2:1:1. That fits the observed data.

So that would mean the aliphatic region has three singlets: one at 12 H (2:1:1 ratio), the others at 6 H each.

Wait, but the 2:1:1 ratio is for the areas, so 2 parts, 1 part, 1 part. So 12 H is 2 parts, 6 H is 1 part per each. So 2 +1 +1 =4 parts. But 12 +6 +6=24 H. 24 /4 =6 per part. So 12 H is 2 parts, 6 H is 1 part. So this matches.

So in this scenario, the two compounds would have:

- Compound X (1,2,4,5-tetramethyl): methyl groups at 1 and 4 (same shift as X's 1 and 4 and Y's 1 and 5 → singlet 12 H), and methyl groups at 2 and 5 (6 H).

- Compound Y (1,2,3,5-tetramethyl): methyl groups at 1 and 5 (same shift as X's 1 and 4 → singlet 12 H), and methyl groups at 2 and 3 (6 H).

Wait, but the 2 and 5 groups of X and 2 and 3 groups of Y would each be 6 H, but perhaps their chemical shifts are different. So the aliphatic region would have three signals: 12 H (from X's 1,4 and Y's 1,5), 6 H (from X's 2,5), and 6 H (from Y's 2,3).

So the ratio would be 12:6:6 → 2:1:1.

Yes, that fits.

So the two compounds in the mixture would be 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, which is option D.

Wait, but let's check the aromatic signals.

Each compound contributes their own aromatic protons.

For 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: the aromatic H's are at positions 3 and 6. Which are equivalent due to symmetry, giving a singlet integrating for 2 H.

For 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: the aromatic H's are at positions 4 and 6. Are these equivalent? Hmm, in this structure, the substituents are at 1,2,3,5. So positions 4 and 6 have H's. Are they equivalent?

Earlier analysis suggested they might not be, unless there's a symmetry. But perhaps in this case, they are equivalent, leading to a singlet of 2 H.

Wait, but if the substituents are at 1,2,3,5, then the H's at 4 and 6 would be in different environments. So their chemical shifts would be different, leading to two separate signals. But the problem states that the aromatic region has two singlets. So each compound contributes one singlet.

Wait, perhaps in 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, the H's at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent. Let me think again. If the structure has a plane of symmetry, maybe positions 4 and 6 are mirrored, making their environments identical. So their H's would be equivalent, giving a singlet.

So each compound contributes a singlet of 2 H in the aromatic region. So in the mixture, there are two singlets, each integrating for 2 H, but since it's a 1:1 mixture, the ratio would be 1:1.

So the aromatic region has two singlets at around 6.7 ppm (each 2 H), matching the problem statement.

Putting it all together:

The aliphatic region has three singlets: 12 H (2 parts), 6 H (1 part), 6 H (1 part). The aromatic region has two singlets, each 2 H.

Which matches the given NMR data.

So the correct answer is option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying two aromatic compounds in a 1:1 mixture based on their **¹H NMR spectrum**. The molecular formula of each compound is **C₁₀H₁₄**, and the spectrum shows:

1. **Aromatic region**: Two singlets at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, integrating for 2 H each.
2. **Aliphatic region**: Three singlets at around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio, integrating for a total of 12 H.

### Key Analysis:
#### **Aromatic Region**:
- Each compound must have aromatic protons that appear as singlets, meaning the protons are equivalent and have no neighboring protons.
- For **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene**, the aromatic protons are at positions 3 and 6. These are equivalent due to symmetry, resulting in a single singlet integrating for 2 H.
- For **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**, the aromatic protons are at positions 4 and 6. These are also equivalent due to symmetry, resulting in a single singlet integrating for 2 H.
- In the mixture, the aromatic signals from the two compounds overlap, producing two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.

#### **Aliphatic Region**:
- The three singlets at 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio correspond to methyl groups.
- **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** has two pairs of equivalent methyl groups: one pair at positions 1 and 4, and another pair at positions 2 and 5. These contribute two singlets.
- **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene** has two pairs of equivalent methyl groups: one pair at positions 1 and 5, and another pair at positions 2 and 3. These also contribute two singlets.
- In the mixture, the methyl groups at positions 1 and 4 of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** overlap with the methyl groups at positions 1 and 5 of **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**, resulting in a combined singlet for 12 H. The other two pairs of methyl groups (2 and 5 from **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene**, and 2 and 3 from **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**) contribute two separate singlets, each integrating for 6 H. This matches the observed 2:1:1 ratio.

### Conclusion:
The two compounds in the mixture are **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**, corresponding to **Option D**.
