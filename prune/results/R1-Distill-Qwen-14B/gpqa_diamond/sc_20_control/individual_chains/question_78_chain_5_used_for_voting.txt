Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is about finding the correct expressions for the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a point r and time t, given that the charge q is moving with velocity v at an earlier time tr. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different expressions.

First, I remember that potentials in electrodynamics are influenced by both the charge and the current it produces. Since the charge is moving, there's a current, which should affect the vector potential.

Scalar potential, V, for a static charge (like in Coulomb's law) is V = q/(4πε₀ r). But when the charge is moving, especially at relativistic speeds, there might be some modifications due to the motion. Alternatively, maybe it's the same as static since potentials are frame-dependent? Wait, but the problem states t > tr, so the charge has already passed the point of consideration. Hmm, but potentials depend on retarded times, right?

Wait, I think for a moving charge, the scalar potential isn't just the Coulomb potential anymore. But wait, for potentials, the scalar potential is affected by the motion, but maybe in this case, because we're considering the potential at a later time, it's similar to the static case. Or perhaps the scalar potential is still given by the static formula, but the vector potential contributes the magnetic part.

Wait, no, the scalar potential is due to the charge's electric field, and the vector potential is due to the current (magnetic field). So, the scalar potential should just be V = q/(4πε₀ r'), where r' is the distance from the charge's position at tr. But wait, no, because the charge is moving, the position isn't straightforward. Oh wait, but in the problem statement, the charge's position at the generating time tr is some earlier point, and d is the vector from that point to r. So, the distance from the charge's position at tr to the field point r is d, so r = d. So, V would be q/(4πε₀ d), right?

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says V is q/(4πε₀ r), but r here is the distance from origin to r, but wait, no, because the charge is at position s(tr) at time tr, and d is the vector from s(tr) to r. So, the distance between r and the charge's position is |d|. So, the scalar potential would be V = q/(4πε₀ |d|), but in the options, some have terms involving d and v, like in C and D, where the denominators have (d c - d·v) and (d c + d·v) respectively.

Wait, that makes me think of the retarded time. Oh! Because the potential at time t depends on the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time tr, which is the retarded time. The retarded time tr is given by tr = t - |d|/c, assuming d is the separation vector between the charge's position and the observation point at time tr.

So, for scalar potential, perhaps it's similar to the static case, but with the distance being adjusted for the motion. Alternatively, maybe for a moving charge, the scalar potential depends on the velocity.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the Liénard potentials. The scalar and vector potentials for a moving charge are given by certain expressions. The scalar potential V is (q/(4πε₀)) * (1/(r' - (v t_r)/c²)), or something like that. Wait, no, the exact expressions might be more involved.

Alternatively, another approach: the potentials are determined by the charge and current distributions. The charge q moving with velocity v produces a current. So, the scalar potential V is due to the charge, and the vector potential A is due to the current.

Wait, another thing: the potentials are given by integrals over the charge's history. But in the case of a point charge moving with velocity v, perhaps we can find expressions based on retarded time and the velocity.

I remember that when a charge moves with velocity v, the scalar potential V is given by q/(4πε₀ r'), where r' is the distance from the charge's position at the retarded time. But wait, in this problem, they've defined d as the vector from the charge's position (at tr) to the observation point r, so the distance is |d|. So V should be q/(4πε₀ |d|). Looking at the options, option A has V as q/(4πε₀ r), but r here is the vector from origin to r. Wait, that's not the same as |d|. So perhaps options A and B are incorrect because their V is based on r, not d.

Wait, the problem statement says that r is the field point with respect to the origin. The charge's position at time tr is s(tr). The vector d is from s(tr) to r, so d = r - s(tr). So, the distance between the charge at tr and the field point is |d|.

So, the scalar potential V would be V = q/(4πε₀ |d|). But looking at the options, none of them have V as that. Wait, option C and D have V terms with (d c - d·v) in the denominator. Hmm, perhaps that's due to the time delay affecting the distance.

Wait, I think I'm mixing up something. The potentials depend on the charge's position and velocity at the retarded time. The scalar potential is:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ (1 / |d|) ) ] multiplied by some factor due to kinematic terms.

Wait, I think the expression for V when the charge is moving is more complicated. Because the charge's velocity affects the way the potential propagates. Let me recall the expression for the scalar potential for a moving charge.

The scalar potential for a charge moving with velocity v is given by (from memory):

V(r, t) = [ q / (4πε₀) ] / ( |d| [ 1 - (v·d̂)/c ] )

Wait, where d̂ is the unit vector in the direction of d, and v is the velocity at the retarded time. Because the charge is moving, the potential "catches up" a bit. So, this makes the denominator not just |d|, but |d| multiplied by 1 minus (v·d̂)/c.

Wait, but let me think more precisely. The standard expression for the scalar potential due to a charge in motion is:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) [ 1 / ( |r - (v t_r)| ) ]

Wait, no, that's probably not correct. The correct expression for the scalar potential of a moving charge involves considering the charge's position at the retarded time. So, let me think: the retarded time tr is t - |r - r'(tr)| / c, where r'(tr) is the charge's position at time tr. Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled, but perhaps another approach is better.

Alternatively, I've read that the scalar potential for a charge moving with velocity v is given by:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) [ 1 / (r' - (v/c²) (t - tr) ) ] 

Wait, maybe that's not the right way. Another approach: the potentials can be found using the retarded potentials formula. 

The scalar potential V(r, t) is:

V(r, t) = (1/(4πε₀)) ∫ [ρ(r', t')] dτ,

where ρ is the charge density, and the integral is over the past (retarded) time. For a point charge moving with velocity v, the charge density is δ^3(r' - s(t')), so the integral becomes (q/(4πε₀)) ∫ δ^3(r' - s(t')) dt' / (something), but wait, the potential propagates at speed c, so the integral is over t' such that the distance from r' to r is |r - r'| = c(t - t').

Wait, perhaps the scalar potential is:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) [ 1 / (|d| (1 - (v·d̂)/c)) ) ]

Where d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r, so d = r - s(tr). So |d| is the distance between the charge and the field point at tr.

Wait, let me think about that. The factor (1 - (v·d̂)/c) comes from the Lorentz contraction or the relativistic effects. Because the charge's motion affects the way the potential spreads out. So in the expression for V, we have a denominator that's |d| multiplied by (1 - (v·d̂)/c ), where d̂ is the unit vector in the direction of d.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C and D have denominators like (d c - d·v). Let me see: d is the vector, so d c is c times d, and d·v is the dot product of d and v. So, the denominator in C is (d c - d·v) = c |d| - v·d. Hmm, wait, because d is a vector, but in the denominator, it's written as (d c - d·v), which is a bit unclear, unless it's intended to be c |d| - (v · d), which would be scalar terms.

Wait, wait, the denominator in option C is (d c - vec{d}·vec{v})... but that would be a term like (c * d - (d · v)) which is a vector minus a scalar. That doesn't make sense. So perhaps the options have a typo, but more likely, maybe they expressed it as (c |d| - d·v), where d is a vector. So, let's say the denominator is (c |d| - (d · v)).

So, the scalar potential would be V = (q c) / [4πε₀ (c |d| - (d · v)) ].

Wait, but that's what option C says: V = (q c)/(4πε₀ (d c - d·v)).

Wait, but in option C, the denominator is (d c - d·v). Since d is a vector, multiplying by c would make it a vector, but I think the denominator should be a scalar. So perhaps the options are written in a way that (d c) is c |d|, and (d · v) is the scalar product. So, the denominator would be c |d| - (d · v) as a scalar.

Assuming that, then V would be (q c) / [4πε₀ (c |d| - (d · v) ) ].

Wait, but I thought the scalar potential was (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/( |d| (1 - (v·d̂)/c )) ]

Which can be rewritten as (q/(4πε₀)) * (1/( (|d| c - (d · v)) / c )) ) ) because (v · d̂ ) = (v · d)/|d|, so 1 - (v · d̂)/c = [ c |d| - (v · d) ] / (c |d| )

So, 1/( [ (c |d| - (v · d) ) / (c |d| ) ]) = c |d| / ( c |d| - (v · d) ) 

So, substituting back into V, we get:

V = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ c |d| / (c |d| - (v · d)) ) ]

Which is (q c |d| ) / [4πε₀ ( c |d| - (v · d) ) ]

Wait, but in option C, the V is (q c)/(4πε₀ (d c - d·v)).

So, the denominator is (d c - d · v), which if d is a vector, that would be c times the vector d minus the scalar (d · v). That can't be right, unless it's a typo and the denominator is (c |d| - (d · v)).

Wait, perhaps in the options, the denominator is written as (c |d| - d · v), so option C's V would be ( q c ) / [4πε₀ ( c |d| - (d · v) ) ]

Which matches what I have above, except my expression has an extra |d| in the numerator. Wait, that's a problem.

Hmm, wait, in my expression, I have |d| in the numerator. Let me double-check my steps.

The scalar potential expression from the Liénard potentials (which I think I'm trying to recall) is V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ 1/( r' - (v/c²) (t - t_r) ) ]

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the distance. Alternatively, perhaps the correct expression is:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ 1 / ( |d| ( 1 - (v · d̂)/c ) ) ]

Which is the same as [ q/(4πε₀) ] * [ |d|/( |d| c - (v · d) ) ]

Because 1/( a (1 - b) ) = a/( a (1 - b) )... Wait, no, 1/( |d| (1 - (v · d̂)/c )) ) = 1/( |d| ( (c |d| - (v · d )) / (c |d|) ) ) )

So, that's equal to 1/( |d| ) * (c |d| ) / (c |d| - (v · d)) ) )
Which simplifies to c / (c |d| - (v · d )) )

So, V becomes (q c ) / (4πε₀ ( c |d| - (v · d) ) )

Which matches option C's V, except option C's denominator is (d c - d · v), but if d is a vector, that would imply a vector minus a scalar, which isn't correct. So perhaps the options have a typo. But perhaps they meant (c |d| - (d · v)) as the denominator.

Assuming that, then V is (q c)/(4πε₀ (c |d| - (d · v) )) ), which is option C's V. 

Now, what about the vector potential A?

The vector potential is given by (μ₀ q/(4π)) * (v / (c²)) / (something), perhaps. Wait, the standard expression for the vector potential due to a moving charge is A(r, t) = (μ₀ q)/(4π c²) [ v / (c |d| - (v · d)) ) ] × (d )

Wait, no, wait. The vector potential for a moving charge is typically given by:

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q)/(4π c²) (v(t_r) ) / (c |d| - (v · d) )

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the formula. Another way: the vector potential is related to the current. The current due to a moving charge is J = q v δ³( ... ), and the vector potential A is given by the integral of J over space and time, divided by c².

But perhaps a more straightforward approach is to think of the vector potential as (μ₀/(4π)) times the line integral of the current element over the past. But perhaps that's getting too involved.

Wait, another approach: the vector potential for a moving charge can be written as (μ₀ q v )/(4π c²) [ 1/(c |d| - (v · d) ) ] times the unit vector in the direction of d, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: the vector potential is proportional to the velocity of the charge, and inversely proportional to the same denominator as the scalar potential.

Looking at the options, option C has A as (μ₀ q c v )/(4π (d c - d · v)).

Wait, let's compute the dimensions to check. Let's see: if V is in volts (J/C), then (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c - v·d)) would have units of (C * m/s)/(m * m/s) )? Wait, no, [d c] is (m * m/s )? No, d is a vector in meters, c is m/s, so d c would be m * m/s, which is m²/s, but that's not matching the denominator, which should be a scalar distance.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Let's think about the units for the potentials.

Scalar potential V has units of volts (V), which is J/C.

Vector potential A has units of T·m², which is (Wb/m²) * m² = Wb, but more accurately, A is in Tesla meters, since B = ∇×A, and B is Tesla. Alternatively, A has units of (kg·m)/(s³·A), but perhaps that's not helpful right now.

Looking at option C's A: (μ₀ q c v )/(4π (d c - d·v )).

μ₀ has units of H/m (henrys per meter), which is kg·m/(s²·A²).

So, numerator: μ₀ q c v.

q is coulombs (C), c is m/s, v is m/s.

So, units would be (kg·m/(s²·A²)) * C * (m/s) * (m/s) )

C is same as A·s, so:

kg·m/(s²·A²) * A·s * (m/s) * (m/s) 

= kg·m/(s²·A²) * A·s * m²/s²

= kg·m * A·s * m² / ( s² A² s² )

= kg m³ / ( s³ A )

Denominator in option C's A: (d c - d·v) is (m * m/s) - (m * m/s) ) → m²/s.

So, overall units for A in option C would be:

[ kg m³/(s³ A) ] / [ m²/s ]

= kg m³/(s³ A) * s/(m² )

= kg m/(s² A )

Which is the correct unit for the vector potential, since A (vector) has units kg·m/(s²·A).

So the units match for option C.

Similarly, option D's A is (mu_0 q c v )/(4 pi (d c + d·v)), but I'm considering whether the denominator is correct.

Now, for the scalar potential, according to option C, V is (q c)/(4 pi epsilon_0 (d c - d·v)).

Wait, but as I thought earlier, the denominator should be a scalar. So, in option C, if d is a vector, then (d c) is a vector, and (d · v) is a scalar, so subtracting them would lead to a vector minus a scalar, which is not possible. So option C's expression is probably incorrect in that aspect.

Wait, perhaps the options are using a different notation, where (d c) is actually c |d|, and (d · v) is the scalar product. So, the denominator would be (c |d| - (d · v)), which is a scalar. So, with that assumption, option C's V and A expressions could be correct.

So, putting it together:

V(r, t) = (q c)/(4 pi epsilon_0 (c |d| - (d · v)) )

A(r, t) = (mu_0 q c v )/(4 pi (c |d| - (d · v)) )

So, looking at option C, the expressions are:

V = (qc)/(4 pi epsilon_0 (d c - d · v) )

A = (mu_0 qc v)/(4 pi (d c - d · v) )

Assuming that (d c) represents c |d|, then yes, this matches.

So, option C would have the correct expressions.

Wait, but what about the vector direction of A? Because A should be along the direction of d, perhaps, or maybe not. Wait, the vector potential A is related to the current, which is in the direction of the velocity v. So, the vector potential A would depend on the velocity vector v.

Hmm, but in option C, A is proportional to v, which makes sense because the current is due to the moving charge's velocity.

So, putting it all together, the correct option is C.

To determine the scalar potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) and vector potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \) at time \( t \) for a moving point charge \( q \), we analyze the situation where the charge moves with velocity \( \vec{v} \) at the retarded time \( t_r \). The vector \( \vec{d} \) is defined as the displacement from the charge's position at \( t_r \) to the observation point \( \vec{r} \). The potentials depend on the charge's motion and the separation between the charge and the observation point.

### Scalar Potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \)
The scalar potential for a moving charge is influenced by the charge's velocity and the relativistic effects due to the motion. The correct expression for \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) is derived from the retarded potential formulation. It is proportional to the charge \( q \) and inversely proportional to the effective distance, which accounts for the motion of the charge. The denominator includes a term \( c |d| - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \), where \( |d| \) is the magnitude of \( \vec{d} \), \( c \) is the speed of light, and \( \vec{v} \) is the velocity of the charge. This matches the form given in **Option C**:
\[
V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{q c}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 (c |d| - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})}.
\]

### Vector Potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \)
The vector potential is proportional to the velocity \( \vec{v} \) of the charge and arises due to the current generated by the moving charge. It is also inversely proportional to the same effective distance \( c |d| - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \). The correct expression for \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \) is:
\[
\vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0 q c \vec{v}}{4 \pi (c |d| - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})}.
\]
This matches the form given in **Option C**.

### Analysis of Options
- **Option A**: Incorrect because it assumes the scalar potential \( V \) is independent of the charge's velocity, which is not the case for a moving charge.
- **Option B**: Incorrect because it similarly neglects the velocity-dependent correction in the scalar potential.
- **Option C**: Correct, as it includes the velocity-dependent correction in both \( V \) and \( \vec{A} \), consistent with the retarded potential formulation.
- **Option D**: Incorrect because the denominator in the potentials includes \( c |d| + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \), which does not match the relativistic correction for a moving charge.

### Conclusion
The correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in **Option C**:
\[
V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{q c}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 (c |d| - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})}, \quad \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0 q c \vec{v}}{4 \pi (c |d| - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})}.
\]

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is about finding the correct expressions for the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a point r and time t, given that the charge q is moving with velocity v at an earlier time tr. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different expressions.

First, I remember that potentials in electrodynamics are influenced by both the charge and the current it produces. Since the charge is moving, there's a current, which should affect the vector potential.

Scalar potential, V, for a static charge (like in Coulomb's law) is V = q/(4πε₀ r).

Oh wait, but in the problem statement, the charge's position at the generating time tr is some earlier point, and d is the vector from that point to r. So, the distance from the charge's position at tr to the field point r is d, so r = d. So, V would be q/(4πε₀ d), right?

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says V is q/(4πε₀ r), but r here is the distance from origin to r, but wait, no, because the charge is at position s(tr) at time tr, and d is the vector from s(tr) to r. So, the distance between r and the charge's position is |d|. So, the scalar potential would be V = q/(4πε₀ |d|), but in the options, some have terms involving d and v, like in C and D, where the denominators have (d c - d·v) and (d c + d·v) respectively.

Wait, that makes me think of the retarded time. Oh! Because the potential at time t depends on the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time tr, which is the retarded time. The retarded time tr is given by tr = t - |d|/c, assuming d is the separation vector between the charge's position and the observation point at time tr.

So, for scalar potential, perhaps it's similar to the static case, but with the distance being adjusted for the motion. Alternatively, maybe for a moving charge, the scalar potential depends on the velocity.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the Liénard potentials. The scalar and vector potentials for a moving charge are given by certain expressions. The scalar potential V is (q/(4πε₀)) * (1/(r' - (v t_r)/c²)), or something like that. Wait, no, the exact expressions might be more involved.

Alternatively, another approach: the potentials are determined by the charge and current distributions. The charge q moving with velocity v produces a current. So, the scalar potential V is due to the charge, and the vector potential A is due to the current.

But wait, in this problem, they've defined d as the vector from the charge's position (at tr) to the observation point r, so the distance is |d|. So V should be q/(4πε₀ |d|). Looking at the options, option A has V as q/(4πε₀ r), but r here is the vector from origin to r. Wait, that's not the same as |d|. So perhaps options A and B are incorrect because their V is based on r, not d.

Wait, the problem statement says that r is the field point with respect to the origin. The charge's position at time tr is s(tr). The vector d is from s(tr) to r, so d = r - s(tr). So, the distance between the charge at tr and the field point is |d|.

So, the scalar potential V would be V = q/(4πε₀ |d|). But looking at the options, none of them have V as that. Wait, option C and D have V terms with (d c - d·v) in the denominator. Hmm, perhaps that's due to the time delay affecting the distance.

Wait, I think I'm mixing up something. The potentials depend on the charge's position and velocity at the retarded time. The scalar potential is:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ (1 / |d|) ) ] multiplied by some factor due to kinematic terms.

Wait, I think the expression for V when the charge is moving is more complicated. Because the charge's velocity affects the way the potential propagates. Let me recall the expression for the scalar potential for a moving charge.

The scalar potential for a charge moving with velocity v is given by (from memory):

V(r, t) = [ q / (4πε₀) ] / ( |d| [ 1 - (v·d̂)/c ] )

Wait, where d̂ is the unit vector in the direction of d, and v is the velocity at the retarded time. Because the charge is moving, the potential "catches up" a bit. So, this makes the denominator not just |d|, but |d| multiplied by 1 minus (v·d̂)/c.

Wait, but let me think more precisely. The standard expression for the scalar potential due to a charge in motion is:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) [ 1 / ( |r - (v t_r)| ) ]

Wait, no, that's probably not correct. The correct expression for the scalar potential of a moving charge involves considering the charge's position at the retarded time. So, let me think: the retarded time tr is t - |r - r'(tr)| / c, where r'(tr) is the charge's position at time tr. Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled, but perhaps another approach is better.

Alternatively, I've read that the scalar potential for a charge moving with velocity v is given by:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) [ 1 / (r' - (v/c²) (t - tr) ) ] 

Wait, maybe that's not the right way. Another approach: the potentials can be found using the retarded potentials formula. 

The scalar potential V(r, t) is:

V(r, t) = (1/(4πε₀)) ∫ [ρ(r', t')] dτ,

where ρ is the charge density, and the integral is over the past (retarded) time. For a point charge moving with velocity v, the charge density is δ^3(r' - s(t')), so the integral becomes (q/(4πε₀)) ∫ δ^3(r' - s(t')) dt' / (something), but wait, the potential propagates at speed c, so the integral is over t' such that the distance from r' to r is |r - r'| = c(t - t').

Wait, perhaps the scalar potential is:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) [ 1 / (|d| (1 - (v·d̂)/c)) ) ]

Where d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r, so d = r - s(tr). So |d| is the distance between the charge and the field point at tr.

Wait, let me think about that. The factor (1 - (v·d̂)/c) comes from the Lorentz contraction or the relativistic effects. Because the charge's motion affects the way the potential spreads out. So in the expression for V, we have a denominator that's |d| multiplied by (1 - (v·d̂)/c ), where d̂ is the unit vector in the direction of d.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C and D have denominators like (d c - d·v). Let me see: d is the vector, so d c is c times d, and d·v is the dot product of d and v. So, the denominator in C is (d c - d·v) = c |d| - v·d. Hmm, wait, because d is a vector, but in the denominator, it's written as (d c - d·v), which is a bit unclear, unless it's intended to be c |d| - (v · d), which would be scalar terms.

Wait, wait, the denominator in option C is (d c - vec{d}·vec{v})... but that would be a term like (c * d - (d · v)) which is a vector minus a scalar. That doesn't make sense. So perhaps the options have a typo, but more likely, maybe they expressed it as (c |d| - d·v), where d is a vector. So, let's say the denominator is (c |d| - (d · v)).

So, the scalar potential would be V = (q c) / [4πε₀ (c |d| - (d · v)) ].

Wait, but that's what option C says: V = (q c)/(4πε₀ (d c - d·v)).

Wait, but in option C, the denominator is (d c - d·v). Since d is a vector, multiplying by c would make it a vector, but I think the denominator should be a scalar. So perhaps the options are written in a way that (d c) is c |d|, and (d · v) is the scalar product. So, the denominator would be c |d| - (d · v) as a scalar.

Assuming that, then V would be (q c) / [4πε₀ (c |d| - (d · v) ) ].

Wait, but I thought the scalar potential was (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/( |d| (1 - (v·d̂)/c )) ]

Which can be rewritten as (q/(4πε₀)) * (1/( (|d| c - (d · v)) / c )) ) ) because (v · d̂ ) = (v · d)/|d|, so 1 - (v · d̂)/c = [ c |d| - (v · d) ] / (c |d| )

So, 1/( [ (c |d| - (v · d) ) / (c |d| ) ]) = c |d| / ( c |d| - (v · d) ) 

So, substituting back into V, we get:

V = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ c |d| / (c |d| - (v · d)) ) ]

Which is (q c |d| ) / [4πε₀ ( c |d| - (v · d) ) ]

Wait, but in option C, the V is (q c)/(4πε₀ (d c - d·v)).

So, the denominator is (d c - d · v), which if d is a vector, that would be c times the vector d minus the scalar (d · v). That can't be right, unless it's a typo and the denominator is (c |d| - (d · v)).

Wait, perhaps in the options, the denominator is written as (c |d| - d · v), so option C's V would be ( q c ) / [4πε₀ ( c |d| - (d · v) ) ]

Which matches what I have above, except my expression has an extra |d| in the numerator. Wait, that's a problem.

Hmm, wait, in my expression, I have |d| in the numerator. Let me double-check my steps.

The scalar potential expression from the Liénard potentials (which I think I'm trying to recall) is V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ 1/( r' - (v/c²) (t - t_r) ) ]

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the distance. Alternatively, perhaps the correct expression is:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ 1 / ( |d| ( 1 - (v · d̂)/c ) ) ]

Which is the same as [ q/(4πε₀) ] * [ |d|/( |d| c - (v · d) ) ]

Because 1/( a (1 - b) ) = a/( a (1 - b) )... Wait, no, 1/( |d| (1 - (v · d̂)/c )) ) = 1/( |d| ( (c |d| - (v · d )) / (c |d|) ) ) )

So, that's equal to 1/( |d| ) * (c |d| ) / (c |d| - (v · d)) ) )
Which simplifies to c / (c |d| - (v · d )) )

So, V becomes (q c ) / (4πε₀ ( c |d| - (v · d) ) )

Which matches option C's V, except option C's denominator is (d c - d · v), but if d is a vector, that would imply a vector minus a scalar, which isn't correct. So perhaps the options have a typo. But perhaps they meant (c |d| - (d · v)) as the denominator.

Assuming that, then V is (q c)/(4πε₀ (c |d| - (d · v) )) ), which is option C's V. 

Now, what about the vector potential A?

The vector potential is given by (μ₀ q/(4π)) * (v / (c²)) / (something), perhaps. Wait, the standard expression for the vector potential due to a moving charge is A(r, t) = (μ₀ q)/(4π c²) [ v / (c |d| - (v · d)) ) ] × (d )

Wait, no, wait. The vector potential for a moving charge is typically given by:

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q)/(4π c²) (v(t_r) ) / (c |d| - (v · d) )

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the formula. Another way: the vector potential is related to the current. The current due to a moving charge is J = q v δ³( ... ), and the vector potential A is given by the integral of J over space and time, divided by c².

But perhaps a more straightforward approach is to think of the vector potential as (μ₀/(4π)) times the line integral of the current element over the past. But perhaps that's getting too involved.

Wait, another approach: the vector potential for a moving charge can be written as (μ₀ q v )/(4π c²) [ 1/(c |d| - (v · d) ) ] times the unit vector in the direction of d, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: the vector potential is proportional to the velocity of the charge, and inversely proportional to the same denominator as the scalar potential.

Looking at the options, option C has A as (μ₀ q c v )/(4π (d c - d · v)).

Wait, let's compute the dimensions to check. Let's see: if V is in volts (J/C), then (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c - v·d)) would have units of (C * m/s)/(m * m/s) )? Wait, no, [d c] is (m * m/s )? No, d is a vector in meters, c is m/s, so d c would be m * m/s, which is m²/s, but that's not matching the denominator, which should be a scalar distance.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Let's think about the units for the potentials.

Scalar potential V has units of volts (V), which is J/C.

Vector potential A has units of T·m², which is (Wb/m²) * m² = Wb, but more accurately, A is in Tesla meters, since B = ∇×A, and B is Tesla. Alternatively, A has units of (kg·m)/(s³·A), but perhaps that's not helpful right now.

Looking at option C's A: (μ₀ q c v )/(4π (d c - d·v )).

μ₀ has units of H/m (henrys per meter), which is kg·m/(s²·A²).

So, numerator: μ₀ q c v.

q is coulombs (C), c is m/s, v is m/s.

So, units would be (kg·m/(s²·A²)) * C * (m/s) * (m/s) )

C is same as A·s, so:

kg·m/(s²·A²) * A·s * (m/s) * (m/s) 

= kg·m/(s²·A²) * A·s * m²/s²

= kg·m * A·s * m² / ( s² A² s² )

= kg m³ / ( s³ A )

Denominator in option C's A: (d c - d·v) is (m * m/s) - (m * m/s) ) → m²/s.

So, overall units for A in option C would be:

[ kg m³/(s³ A) ] / [ m²/s ]

= kg m³/(s³ A) * s/(m² )

= kg m/(s² A )

Which is the correct unit for the vector potential, since A (vector) has units kg·m/(s²·A).

So the units match for option C.

Similarly, option D's A is (mu_0 q c v )/(4 pi (d c + d·v)), but I'm considering whether the denominator is correct.

Now, for the scalar potential, according to option C, V is (q c)/(4 pi epsilon_0 (d c - d·v)).

Wait, but as I thought earlier, the denominator should be a scalar. So, in option C, if d is a vector, then (d c) is a vector, and (d · v) is a scalar, so subtracting them would lead to a vector minus a scalar, which is not possible. So option C's expression is probably incorrect in that aspect.

Wait, perhaps the options are using a different notation, where (d c) is actually c |d|, and (d · v) is the scalar product. So, the denominator would be (c |d| - (d · v)), which is a scalar. So, with that assumption, option C's V and A expressions could be correct.

So, putting it together:

V(r, t) = (q c)/(4 pi epsilon_0 (c |d| - (d · v)) )

A(r, t) = (mu_0 q c v )/(4 pi (c |d| - (d · v)) )

So, looking at option C, the expressions are:

V = (qc)/(4 pi epsilon_0 (d c - d · v) )

A = (mu_0 qc v)/(4 pi (d c - d · v) )

Assuming that (d c) represents c |d|, then yes, this matches.

So, option C would have the correct expressions.

Wait, but what about the vector direction of A? Because A should be along the direction of d, perhaps, or maybe not. Wait, the vector potential A is related to the current, which is in the direction of the velocity v. So, the vector potential A would depend on the velocity vector v.

Hmm, but in option C, A is proportional to v, which makes sense because the current is due to the moving charge's velocity.

So, putting it all together, the correct option is C.


To determine the scalar potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) and vector potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \) at time \( t \) for a moving point charge \( q \), we analyze the situation where the charge moves with velocity \( \vec{v} \) at the retarded time \( t_r \). The vector \( \vec{d} \) is defined as the displacement from the charge's position at \( t_r \) to the observation point \( \vec{r} \). The potentials depend on the charge's motion and the separation between the charge and the observation point.

### Scalar Potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \)
The scalar potential for a moving charge is influenced by the charge's velocity and the relativistic effects due to the motion. The correct expression for \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) is derived from the retarded potential formulation. It is proportional to the charge \( q \) and inversely proportional to the effective distance, which accounts for the motion of the charge. The denominator includes a term \( c |d| - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \), where \( |d| \) is the magnitude of \( \vec{d} \), \( c \) is the speed of light, and \( \vec{v} \) is the velocity of the charge. This matches the form given in **Option C**:
\[
V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{q c}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 (c |d| - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})}.
\]

### Vector Potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \)
The vector potential is proportional to the velocity \( \vec{v} \) of the charge and arises due to the current generated by the moving charge. It is also inversely proportional to the same effective distance \( c |d| - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \). The correct expression for \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \) is:
\[
\vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0 q c \vec{v}}{4 \pi (c |d| - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})}.
\]
This matches the form given in **Option C**.

### Analysis of Options
- **Option A**: Incorrect because it assumes the scalar potential \( V \) is independent of the charge's velocity, which is not the case for a moving charge.
- **Option B**: Incorrect because it similarly neglects the velocity-dependent correction in the scalar potential.
- **Option C**: Correct, as it includes the velocity-dependent correction in both \( V \) and \( \vec{A} \), consistent with the retarded potential formulation.
- **Option D**: Incorrect because the denominator in the potentials includes \( c |d| + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \), which does not match the relativistic correction for a moving charge.

### Conclusion
The correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in **Option C**:
\[
V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{q c}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 (c |d| - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})}, \quad \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0 q c \vec{v}}{4 \pi (c |d| - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})}.
\]
