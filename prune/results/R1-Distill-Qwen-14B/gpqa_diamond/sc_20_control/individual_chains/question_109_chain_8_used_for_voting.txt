Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about nucleons emitting a particle. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. 

Wait, what's that equation? So T is the isospin, S is the spin, and L is the orbital angular momentum. So T equals S + L +1, modulo 2. That probably means that T, S, and L have to be either even or odd in such a way that their combination satisfies this equation.

The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So applying the equation, 0 = S + L +1 mod 2. Let's rearrange that. S + L = -1 mod 2, but since mod 2, -1 is same as 1. So S + L ≡1 mod 2. So S and L must be different in parity. Either S is even, L is odd, or S odd, L even.

The problem is to determine which partial wave is not permitted when the NN system emits particle X. The options are different transitions with different angular momentum states for X, like S, P, D, etc.

Wait, the options are labeled with things like 7D1, which probably refers to the orbital angular momentum quantum number l. Let me think: in the notation, the term is 2S+1 L J. So for example, 1S0 would be S=0 (since 2*0+1=1), L=0 (S), and J=0.

When the NN system emits a particle X, their orbital state changes. So the initial state is 1S0, and they go to a new state, say, 3S1, or 3P0, etc. Also, particle X has a certain orbital angular momentum.

The question also mentions that conservation of both angular momentum and parity must be used. So, let's think about both.

First, parity. The initial state has parity. The parity of the initial state is given by (-1)^(L + S), since for a two-body system, the parity is (-1)^(L + S) multiplied by the intrinsic parity. Wait, but each nucleon has intrinsic parity +1, I think. For identical particles, the overall parity includes their spin and orbital contributions. Hmm.

Wait, no. The parity of a two-body state is (-1)^(L + S), because the orbital part contributes (-1)^L and the spin part contributes (-1)^S. So the total parity is (-1)^(L+S). 

In the initial state, it's 1S0. So S is 0 (since 2S+1 =1 → S=0). L is 0 because S0. So parity is (-1)^(0+0) = 1.

After emission of X, the parity of the system must change by the parity of particle X. Because the parity of the final state should account for the parity of the emitted particle. So the overall parity after emission would be initial parity multiplied by the parity of X, and the parity of the new NN state.

Wait, but the parity of the NN state after emission would be (-1)^{L_new + S_new}, where L_new and S_new are their new orbital and spin angular momenta. But wait, are the spin and orbital of the NN changing? Let's think: the system emits a particle X, which carries away some angular momentum and perhaps some spin.

But for the parity consideration, the parity of the final state (NN) would contribute, and the parity of the emitted particle X. So the total parity before and after must be the same.

Wait, but in the decay, the initial parity is P_initial = (-1)^(L_initial + S_initial) = (-1)^(0+0)=1.

After the decay, the final state is the NN state plus the X. So the total parity would be P_final = P_NN * P_X. Because each part contributes their own parity.

So P_initial = P_final → 1 = P_NN * P_X.

Given that the particle X has intrinsic parity -1, as given in the question. So P_X = -1.

So 1 = P_NN * (-1) → P_NN = -1.

So the parity of the final NN state is (-1)^(L_NN + S_NN) = -1.

So (-1)^(L_NN + S_NN) = -1 → L_NN + S_NN must be odd.

Wait, (-1) raised to an odd number is -1. So L_NN + S_NN is odd.

But from the earlier equation from Pauli statistics, S + L ≡1 mod 2. So that's the same condition. So that's consistent.

So the parity condition gives us that L_NN + S_NN is odd. Which is the same as the condition from Pauli statistics.

So the emission of X with parity -1 requires the final NN state to have parity -1, which in turn requires that their L and S sum to an odd number.

Now, about angular momentum conservation. The total angular momentum before and after must be conserved. The initial state has angular momentum J_initial. The NN system is in a state with J_initial, and emits X which carries away J_X. But wait, in the problem statement, the options don't specify the angular momentum of X, but the orbital part of X's state.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The problem is about the transition from the initial state (1S0) to a new state, and emitting X. The new state of the NN system would have a certain L and S, and the emitted X has a certain orbital angular momentum (denoted by the lowercase letter in the options, like p which is P state, l=1; s would be S, l=0; d is l=2; f is l=3? Wait, no, spectroscopic notation uses letters where S=0, P=1, D=2, F=3, etc. So in the options, the emitted X is in a certain l state, which contributes to its orbital angular momentum.

So the initial state has J_initial = 0 (since it's 1S0, J=0). The final state has J_final for the NN system, but the total angular momentum must equal the initial, considering the X's angular momentum.

But since the problem is about partial waves, perhaps we're considering the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle. So the process is: the NN system emits X, and in the center of mass frame, the orbital angular momentum is contributed by the relative motion of X and the NN system. So the total angular momentum is the sum of the NN's J, X's angular momentum, and their orbital angular momentum. But this might not be the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of X is what's considered in the options. Each option gives the orbital state of X, like in option A, X is in a 7D1 state. Wait, that doesn't make much sense because 7D1 would have a higher l, but given that the options are about the angular momentum state of X, perhaps the orbital angular momentum l is given.

Wait, the options are like 1S0 -> 7D1 + p, where p is the orbital state of X? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, looking at the options:

A) 1S0 → 7D1 + p

Hmm, I'm not sure I get it. Maybe the notation is that the NN system goes from 1S0 to a certain state, and X is emitted in a certain state. For example, in option A, the NN state becomes 7D1, and X is in p state (l=1). Or perhaps the other way around. Wait, the correct way to interpret the options is probably that the NN system emits X, and the X is in a certain state (like S, P, D, F), and the final NN state is something else.

Wait, each option is written as initial → final + X's state. So for example, option B is 1S0 → 3S1 + p. So the NN system goes from 1S0 to 3S1 (so their new state is 3S1), and X is emitted in a p state (l=1).

But wait, 3S1 would mean that their orbital angular momentum L is 0 (since S notation implies L=0?), but wait no. Wait, the term symbol is (2S+1)L J. So 3S1: 2S+1=3 → S=1. L is S, meaning L=0? Because S here is the letter. Wait, no. Wait, S, P, D, F correspond to L=0,1,2,3. So in 3S1, L is 0 because S is the label. So the orbital angular momentum is 0, and spin is 1. So the total angular momentum J is 1.

But in any case, perhaps the main point is that when the NN emits X, their new state has certain L and S, and X has its own orbital angular momentum l. So the total angular momentum must be conserved, meaning that the sum of the NN's J, X's orbital angular momentum l, and their relative orbital angular momentum (which might be part of the X's emission) must equal the initial J.

But I think I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the steps again.

1. Initial state: 1S0. So S=0 (from 2S+1=1), L=0 (from S0), and J=0.

2. The NN system emits X. The final state of the NN system is a certain state, say, T(NN) =0. So their isospin is 0, which is given.

3. The Pauli equation gives T = S + L +1 mod 2 → 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L =1 mod2.

So S and L must be of opposite parity.

4. The parity of the NN final state must be (-1)^(L + S) = (-1)^1 = -1. But from earlier, since the initial parity is 1, and X has parity -1, the final NN parity must be (-1) * (parity of X) → 1 = P_NN * (-1) → P_NN = -1. So yes, (-1)^(L+S) must be -1, which is consistent with L+S being odd.

5. Now, considering angular momentum conservation. The initial total angular momentum is J_initial =0. The final state includes the NN's J and the orbital angular momentum l of X. Wait, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of X is the same as the relative angular momentum between the NN and X. So the total angular momentum after emission is J_NN + l_X (if they're in the same direction?), but that's probably not accurate. Actually, angular momentum is a vector, so the total J_final is the vector sum of J_NN and l_X plus any other angular momenta, but if the system is in a certain state, the orbital angular momentum of X would contribute to the total.

But perhaps the key is that the orbital angular momentum of X (denoted by l in the options) must be such that the total angular momentum is conserved. Since J_initial is zero, the total after emission (J_NN + l_X) must also be zero. Wait, but that can't be right because J_NN and l_X are vectors and don't necessarily add to zero. Alternatively, perhaps their magnitudes must match.

Wait, possibly, the orbital angular momentum of X must account for the change in the NN's angular momentum. Since initially, the NN had J=0. After emission, the NN has J_final, and the X has orbital angular momentum l. So the sum of these must equal zero, but that's only if angular momentum is conserved in the center of mass frame. Hmm, but that might not necessarily be the case.

Wait, perhaps the process is that the NN system emits X, so the NN's angular momentum changes, and X carries away some angular momentum. So the total angular momentum after emission (NN's J + X's l) must equal the initial angular momentum, which is zero. So J_NN + l_X = 0.

But wait, J is the total angular momentum, which includes both orbital and spin parts. But perhaps in the case of the emitted X, we're only considering its orbital angular momentum l, and the NN's J.

Wait, but that might not be correct. Let me think again. The initial state is J=0. After emission, the NN has J_final, and X has its own angular momentum, including l (orbital) and spin. The total angular momentum after emission must be J_final (NN) + (X's J). And that must equal the initial J_initial, which is zero.

So, J_NN + J_X = 0. But X's J is a vector quantity. So |J_NN| must equal |J_X|, and their directions must be opposite.

But this seems a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the orbital angular momentum of X, l_X, and the orbital angular momentum of the NN, L_NN. Because the spin part might be more complicated, and perhaps the question is focusing on the orbital aspects.

Wait, the options give the orbital state of X (like p, s, etc.), which correspond to l_X values. So perhaps the condition is that the orbital angular momentum of X (l_X) plus the orbital angular momentum of the NN (L_NN) must equal zero in magnitude. But that doesn't make sense because they're vectors.

Alternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of X is L_X, and the NN's orbital angular momentum is L_NN. The initial orbital angular momentum of the NN is L_initial =0 (since S0 state). After emission, L_NN must combine with L_X to give zero total orbital angular momentum? Hmm, maybe.

Wait, but angular momentum is conserved. So the total orbital angular momentum before emission is L_initial =0. After emission, the NN has L_NN and X has L_X, so their sum must be zero.

So, L_NN + L_X =0 → L_X = -L_NN. But since orbital angular momentum is quantized in integer values, their magnitudes must be equal, and directions opposite. So |L_NN| = |L_X|.

But L_X is the orbital angular momentum of X, which is given in the options. So for each option, the orbital angular momentum of X is l_X, which is the value corresponding to the letter (p→1, s→0, d→2, f→3).

Wait, the options are about the emitted X's angular momentum state. So for each option, the X has a certain orbital angular momentum l_X. So in option B, X is emitted in a p state → l_X=1.

So for each option, |L_NN| must be equal to l_X, because L_X = -L_NN → |L_NN|=|L_X|.

So, for each option, L_NN must equal l_X in magnitude. But L_NN is the orbital angular momentum of the NN after emission.

Wait, but L_NN is the orbital part of the NN's state. So for each option's final state, let's see what L_NN is.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1S0 → 7D1 + p.
Wait, the final state of NN is 7D1. So term symbol is (2S+1)L J. So (2S+1)=7 → S=3. L is D, which is 2. So L_NN=2.

So L_NN=2. X is in p state → l_X=1.

But then |L_NN| would be 2, |l_X|=1. 2 !=1 → This can't be, so this would violate angular momentum conservation. So this scenario would not be permitted.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, the initial orbital angular momentum is zero. After emission, the NN's orbital angular momentum is L_NN, and X's orbital angular momentum is l_X. So the total must be zero: L_NN + l_X = 0 → L_NN = -l_X. So the magnitudes must be equal, and their directions opposite.

So for the orbital part, |L_NN|= |l_X|.

So in option A, the NN's L is D (L=2), and X is p (l=1). So 2 !=1. So this can't happen. So option A would not be allowed. But let me check other options.

Option B: 1S0 → 3S1 + p.

The final state is 3S1. Term symbol: (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L is S → 0.

So L_NN=0. X is p → l_X=1.

So |L_NN|=0, |l_X|=1. 0≠1. So this would require 0 +1=0 → not possible. So this would not be allowed. But wait, the initial orbital angular momentum was 0; after emission, the sum must also be 0.

So if L_NN=0 and l_X=1, their sum is 1, which is not zero. So this violates angular momentum conservation. Thus, option B is not allowed.

Wait, but I thought the initial state had L=0. So after emission, the sum of the NN's and X's orbital angular momenta must be zero. So in option B, their sum would be 0 +1=1, which isn't zero. So this is not allowed.

Similarly, option C: 1S0 →3D3 +f.

Wait, the final state is 3D3. So (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L is D→2. So L_NN=2.

X is emitted in f state → l_X=3.

So |L_NN|=2, |l_X|=3. 2≠3 → sum is 2+3=5, which isn't zero. So this is not allowed either.

Wait, but wait, the sum could be vectorially zero. But in that case, 2 and 3 can't add to zero unless their directions are opposite, but even then, 2 + (-3) = -1, which isn't zero. So that's impossible.

So option C is also not allowed.

Option D: 1S0 →3P0 +s.

Final state is 3P0. So (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L is P→1. So L_NN=1.

X is emitted in s state → l_X=0.

So L_NN=1, l_X=0. Sum is 1→ which isn't zero. So this also violates conservation.

Wait, but that can't be right because all options would be invalid except one. Hmm, maybe I'm making a mistake in interpreting the problem.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the notation. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

The options are written as 1S0 → ... + something. So the something is the state of X, I think. For example, in option D: 1S0 →3P0 +s. So the final NN state is 3P0, and X is in s state (l=0).

So for the orbital angular momentum:

L_initial =0 (since 1S0). After emission, the NN has L_NN=1 (from 3P0, P is L=1), and X has l_X=0 (s state). So the sum of their orbital angular momenta is 1 +0=1. Which is not equal to the initial L of 0. So this is a problem.

But wait, another way: perhaps the orbital angular momentum of X is the same as the orbital angular momentum carried away, which must balance the change in the NN's orbital angular momentum.

Wait, perhaps the initial orbital angular momentum is L_initial=0 for the NN system. After emission, the NN has L_NN, and X has l_X. So the total orbital angular momentum after is L_NN + l_X. But since the initial orbital angular momentum is zero, we must have L_NN + l_X =0 → L_NN = -l_X.

So the magnitudes must be the same, and opposite in direction.

In that case, for each option:

Option A:

NN final L= D → L=2. X is p → l=1. So 2 ≠1 → Not allowed.

Option B:

NN L= S → L=0. X l=1. 0≠1 → Not allowed.

Option C:

NN L= D → L=2. X l=3. 2≠3 → Not allowed.

Option D:

NN L= P → L=1. X l=0. 1≠0 → Not allowed.

Wait, but this suggests that none of the options satisfy the condition, which can't be right because the question states that one is not permitted.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the orbital angular momentum of X is not the same as the emission's orbital angular momentum but something else.

Wait, maybe the orbital angular momentum of X is part of the decay process. The initial state has orbital angular momentum L=0. The final state has L_NN and l_X, but in such a way that their sum is zero. So L_NN + l_X =0.

So for each option:

A) L_NN=2 (D), l_X=1 (p). 2+1=3 → not zero. So no.

B) L_NN=0 (S), l_X=1 → sum 1→ no.

C) L_NN=2 (D), l_X=3→ sum 5→ no.

D) L_NN=1 (P), l_X=0→ sum 1→ no.

Hmm, this can't be right. So I'm making a mistake in reasoning.

Alternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of X is not part of the angular momentum conservation because it's the orbital part of the X's motion relative to the NN system. So the total angular momentum of the system (NN + X) must equal the initial angular momentum, which is zero. So J_NN + J_X =0.

But J is the total angular momentum, which includes spin and orbital parts. So it's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the process should consider the orbital angular momentum carried by X and the change in the NN's orbital angular momentum. But this is getting a bit too involved.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to look at the possible values of L_NN and l_X and see which options are possible.

We know that the initial state has L_initial =0. After emission, the NN has L_NN, and X carries away l_X. So the conservation of angular momentum (for orbital part) requires that L_initial = L_NN - l_X. Because the initial orbital angular momentum is zero, so 0 = L_NN - l_X → L_NN = l_X.

Wait, perhaps that's the correct way. Because when the NN emit X, the orbital angular momentum of the NN changes by the amount that X carries away. So the change in L_NN is equal to the orbital angular momentum of X.

So, L_NN = L_initial + l_X. Since L_initial is 0, L_NN = l_X.

So for each option, L_NN must equal l_X.

So let's check each option:

Option A: final state is 7D1. So L_NN is D → 2. X's l is p →1. 2≠1→ No.

Option B: final state 3S1 → L= S →0. X l=1. 0≠1→ No.

Option C: final state 3D3 → L=2. X l=3→ 2≠3→ No.

Option D: final state 3P0 → L=1. X l=0→ 1≠0→ No.

So none of the options have L_NN = l_X. But that can't be correct, as the question states that one is not permitted. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the correct condition is that L_NN = l_X.

So which options have L_NN = l_X?

Looking again:

Option A: L_NN=2, l_X=1→ no.

Option B: L_NN=0, l_X=1→ no.

Option C: L_NN=2, l_X=3→ no.

Option D: L_NN=1, l_X=0→ no.

Hmm, that's not working.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the spin and parity separately.

The initial state is 1S0 → S=0, L=0, J=0.

After emission, the NN state has T=0, and their L and S must satisfy S + L =1 mod2 (from earlier).

Now, for the emission process, the total spin and orbital angular momentum must allow for the conservation.

Wait, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of X is l. When the NN system emits X, their orbital angular momentum changes from L_initial=0 to L_NN. The orbital angular momentum of X is l.

In a decay process, orbital angular momentum is conserved. So L_initial (0) + l = L_NN.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because L_initial is 0, and after emission, the NN's L is L_NN, and X has l. So the sum of their orbital angular momenta must equal the initial L.

But the initial L is zero, so L_NN + l =0.

So L_NN = -l. Which means L_NN = l in magnitude, but opposite in direction. So |L_NN|=|l|.

But since L_NN and l are quantum numbers (non-negative integers), their magnitudes must be equal.

So |L_NN|=l_X.

So for each option:

Option A: L_NN=2 (D), l_X=1 → 2≠1 → no.

Option B: L_NN=0, l_X=1→ 0≠1→ no.

Option C: L_NN=2, l_X=3 → 2≠3→ no.

Option D: L_NN=1, l_X=0→ 1≠0→ no.

So this isn't working. So perhaps the way I'm thinking about angular momentum conservation is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible values of L_NN and l_X. Since the initial L is 0, after emission, the sum of L_NN and l_X must be 0 mod something.

Wait, perhaps in terms of possible values, the total orbital angular momentum after emission is L_NN + l_X.

But since the initial was zero, this sum must be zero. But since L and l are integers, this sum can only be zero if L_NN = l_X in magnitude and opposite in direction. But since they are magnitudes, perhaps their sum must be zero vectorially.

But then, for example, if L_NN=2 and l_X=2, but in opposite directions, their sum would be zero. But in that case, their magnitudes are the same. But in the options, the values are different.

Alternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum can be added as vectors, but given that in the options, X's l is given, such as p=1, s=0, etc., and the NN's L is also given, perhaps the only way to have L_NN + l_X =0 is if their magnitudes are the same. So for each option, |L_NN|=|l_X|.

Looking again:

Option A: L_NN=2, l_X=1→ not equal.

Option B: L_NN=0, l_X=1→ not equal.

Option C: L_NN=2, l_X=3→ not equal.

Option D: L_NN=1, l_X=0→ not equal.

Hmm, none satisfy, which can't be right. So perhaps I'm missing something about the problem.

Wait, another angle: considering that the emitted X has a certain orbital angular momentum, and the NN's orbital angular momentum must adjust accordingly.

But perhaps the key is that the orbital angular momentum of X must be such that the NN's final state's L and S satisfy the parity condition, and the angular momentum conservation.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to check each option to see if the parity and angular momentum conditions are met, and which one doesn't meet them.

Let's take each option one by one.

Option A: 1S0 →7D1 + p.

After emission, NN state is 7D1. So term symbol: 7D1 → 2S+1=7→ S=3. L=D=2. J=1.

From Pauli: T = S + L +1 mod2.

So S=3 (odd), L=2 (even). So S+L=5 (odd). So T= (odd) +1 mod2 → 0 mod2. Which matches T=0.

Parity of NN after emission: (-1)^(2+3) = (-1)^5 =-1. Which is correct because initial parity is 1, X has parity -1 → P_NN =-1.

Now, angular momentum: initial J=0. After, J_NN=1, and X has J_X. The total J must be conserved. So 1 (NN) + J_X =0 → J_X= -1. But J must be a non-negative integer or half-integer. So J_X can't be -1. So this is impossible. So this transition is not allowed.

Wait, that's an important point. The total angular momentum after must equal the initial, which is zero. So J_NN + J_X =0. But J is a non-negative magnitude. So J_NN must equal J_X, and their directions opposite. So their vector sum is zero.

But in option A, J_NN=1, so J_X must be 1, but in opposite direction. So vectorially, 1 (NN) and 1 (X) pointing in opposite directions → their sum is zero. So yes, that's possible. But wait, their magnitudes sum to 2, but in vectors, they can cancel.

Wait, no, angular momentum is a vector. So if J_NN is 1 and J_X is 1, but pointing in opposite directions, their vector sum is zero. So this is possible.

But wait, J_X can't be negative. It's the magnitude that matters, but direction affects vector addition.

So for angular momentum conservation, the initial J_initial=0 must equal the vector sum of J_NN and J_X. So if J_NN=1 and J_X=1, and they are opposite in direction, their sum is zero. So this is allowed.

But then, what about the orbital part?

Wait, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of X is l=1. And the NN's orbital angular momentum is L=2. So their sum is 2 +1=3. Which isn't zero. So that's a problem.

Wait, but earlier I thought the sum of their orbital angular momenta should be zero, but maybe that's not the case. Maybe only the total angular momentum (including spin) is conserved.

This is getting complicated. Perhaps another approach is to look for which options have L_NN and l_X such that L_NN + l_X is a possible orbital angular momentum.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is that the NN's orbital angular momentum after emission is L_NN, and the X carries away l_X. So the sum must be zero.

But given that L_initial=0, L_NN + l_X =0 → L_NN = -l_X. So their magnitudes must be equal.

So in option A: L_NN=2, l_X=1 → 2≠1. So not allowed.

Option B: L_NN=0, l_X=1 → 0≠1→ not allowed.

Option C: L_NN=2, l_X=3→ 2≠3→ not allowed.

Option D: L_NN=1, l_X=0→1≠0→ not allowed.

So all options have L_NN not equal to l_X, which suggests that none are allowed, which can't be correct because the question asks which is not permitted.

Wait, but perhaps I'm confusing the orbital angular momentum of X with the emitted particle's orbital state. Maybe the orbital state of X refers to its spin rather than its orbital angular momentum. No, that doesn't make sense. Spin is a separate thing.

Alternatively, perhaps the emitted X's orbital angular momentum is l_X, and the NN's orbital angular momentum is L_NN. The sum of these is the total orbital angular momentum after emission, which must equal the initial, which is zero.

So L_NN + l_X =0 → L_NN = -l_X.

But L and l are magnitudes, so |L_NN|=|l_X|.

So checking the options:

Option D: L_NN=1 (P), l_X=0 (s). So 1≠0→ no.

So this transition isn't allowed because L_NN≠l_X.

Wait, but all options have L_NN≠l_X. So perhaps the correct approach is to check which options have S + L =1 mod2 and parity correct, but angular momentum not conserved.

Alternatively, perhaps the parity is correct but the angular momentum isn't conserved in some options.

Let me think again: the initial state has J=0. The final state must have J=0 as well, considering the emitted X's angular momentum.

Wait, no. Because the initial state is J=0, the total angular momentum after emission (NN's J + X's J) must also be zero. So J_NN + J_X =0.

So for each option, J_NN must equal the opposite of J_X.

But J is a vector, so the magnitudes must be the same, and their directions opposite. So |J_NN| = |J_X|.

So let's compute J for each option.

Option A: Final state is 7D1. So (2S+1)=7→ S=3. L=2 (D). So J can be |L-S| to L+S in steps of 1. So from |3-2|=1 to 3+2=5 → J=1,3,5.

So J_NN can be 1,3,5. X's state is p, which is l=1. But X's spin isn't given, so the total J_X could be any value. But the problem states that the NN state must have J such that J_NN + J_X =0.

So for J_NN=1, J_X must be 1 in opposite direction. So possible.

But the problem is that the NN's orbital angular momentum is 2, and X's orbital is 1. So 2 +1=3, which isn't zero. So regardless of spin, the orbital part isn't conserved. So this transition is not allowed.

Similarly, option B: Final NN state is 3S1. So S=1, L=0. So J can be 1 (since L=0, J=S=1). So J_NN=1. X is in p state (l=1). So J_X could be 1, opposite in direction. So possible.

But let's check orbital angular momentum: L_NN=0, l_X=1. So sum is 1→ not zero. So this transition isn't allowed.

Option C: Final state is 3D3. So S=1, L=2. So J can be |2-1|=1 up to 2+1=3 → J=1,2,3.

So J_NN could be 3. X has l=3 (f state). So J_X could be 3, opposite direction. So 3 + (-3)=0. So angular momentum is conserved, but what about the orbital part? L_NN=2, l_X=3. Sum is5→ not zero. So no.

Option D: Final state is 3P0. So S=1, L=1. So J can be |1-1|=0 to 1+1=2 → J=0,1,2.

But the state is 3P0. So J=0. So J_NN=0. X has l=0 (s state). So J_X=0. So 0+0=0. So this is allowed.

But wait, orbital angular momentum: L_NN=1, l_X=0. Sum is 1→ not zero. So this is not allowed.

So looking at all options:

A: Orbital sum 3→ no.

B: Orbital sum 1→ no.

C: Orbital sum5→ no.

D: Orbital sum1→ no.

Wait, this can't be right because the question says one is not permitted. So perhaps the key is that for some options, the parity condition isn't met.

Wait, let's revisit the parity condition. The NN must have parity -1. So (-1)^(L + S) = -1 → L + S must be odd.

Each option's final state:

A: L=2, S=3 → 2+3=5 (odd) → parity -1. Good.

B: L=0, S=1 → 0+1=1 (odd) → parity -1. Good.

C: L=2, S=1 → 3 (odd) → parity -1. Good.

D: L=1, S=1 → 2 (even) → parity +1. Which is wrong, because earlier calculation said it must be -1.

So option D has the wrong parity, which means it's not allowed.

Ah, so option D is the one that doesn't satisfy the parity condition. So the correct answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the transition of the NN system from the initial state \( ^1S_0 \) (where \( S=0 \), \( L=0 \), and \( J=0 \)) to a final state after emitting a particle \( X \) with intrinsic parity \(-1\). The key considerations are:

1. **Parity Conservation**:  
   The parity of the NN system is given by \( (-1)^{L + S} \). Initially, the parity is \( (-1)^{0+0} = +1 \). After emission, the parity of the NN system must satisfy \( P_{\text{NN}} \cdot P_X = +1 \), where \( P_X = -1 \). Thus, \( P_{\text{NN}} = -1 \), which requires \( L_{\text{NN}} + S_{\text{NN}} \) to be odd.

2. **Pauli Statistics**:  
   The relation \( T = S + L + 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \) must hold. For \( T = 0 \), this implies \( S + L \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \), meaning \( S \) and \( L \) must have opposite parity.

3. **Angular Momentum Conservation**:  
   The total angular momentum \( J \) is conserved. Initially, \( J = 0 \). After emission, the total angular momentum is the sum of the NN system's angular momentum \( J_{\text{NN}} \) and the emitted particle \( X \)'s angular momentum \( J_X \). Thus, \( J_{\text{NN}} + J_X = 0 \), meaning their magnitudes must be equal and their directions opposite.

4. **Orbital Angular Momentum Conservation**:  
   The orbital angular momentum of the NN system \( L_{\text{NN}} \) and the emitted particle \( X \)'s orbital angular momentum \( l_X \) must satisfy \( L_{\text{NN}} + l_X = 0 \). This means \( |L_{\text{NN}}| = |l_X| \).

### Analysis of Each Option

#### **Option A: \( ^1S_0 \to ^7D_1 + p \)**
- Final NN state: \( ^7D_1 \).  
  \( S = 3 \) (from \( 2S+1 = 7 \)), \( L = 2 \) (from \( D \)), and \( J = 1 \).  
  Parity: \( (-1)^{L+S} = (-1)^{2+3} = (-1)^5 = -1 \) (satisfies parity conservation).  
  Angular momentum: \( J_{\text{NN}} = 1 \), so \( J_X = -1 \) (allowed).  
  Orbital angular momentum: \( L_{\text{NN}} = 2 \), \( l_X = 1 \).  
  \( |L_{\text{NN}}| \neq |l_X| \), so orbital angular momentum is not conserved.  
  **This option is not allowed.**

#### **Option B: \( ^1S_0 \to ^3S_1 + p \)**
- Final NN state: \( ^3S_1 \).  
  \( S = 1 \) (from \( 2S+1 = 3 \)), \( L = 0 \) (from \( S \)), and \( J = 1 \).  
  Parity: \( (-1)^{L+S} = (-1)^{0+1} = (-1)^1 = -1 \) (satisfies parity conservation).  
  Angular momentum: \( J_{\text{NN}} = 1 \), so \( J_X = -1 \) (allowed).  
  Orbital angular momentum: \( L_{\text{NN}} = 0 \), \( l_X = 1 \).  
  \( |L_{\text{NN}}| \neq |l_X| \), so orbital angular momentum is not conserved.  
  **This option is not allowed.**

#### **Option C: \( ^1S_0 \to ^3D_3 + f \)**
- Final NN state: \( ^3D_3 \).  
  \( S = 1 \) (from \( 2S+1 = 3 \)), \( L = 2 \) (from \( D \)), and \( J = 3 \).  
  Parity: \( (-1)^{L+S} = (-1)^{2+1} = (-1)^3 = -1 \) (satisfies parity conservation).  
  Angular momentum: \( J_{\text{NN}} = 3 \), so \( J_X = -3 \) (allowed).  
  Orbital angular momentum: \( L_{\text{NN}} = 2 \), \( l_X = 3 \).  
  \( |L_{\text{NN}}| \neq |l_X| \), so orbital angular momentum is not conserved.  
  **This option is not allowed.**

#### **Option D: \( ^1S_0 \to ^3P_0 + s \)**
- Final NN state: \( ^3P_0 \).  
  \( S = 1 \) (from \( 2S+1 = 3 \)), \( L = 1 \) (from \( P \)), and \( J = 0 \).  
  Parity: \( (-1)^{L+S} = (-1)^{1+1} = (-1)^2 = +1 \) (violates parity conservation).  
  Angular momentum: \( J_{\text{NN}} = 0 \), so \( J_X = 0 \) (allowed).  
  Orbital angular momentum: \( L_{\text{NN}} = 1 \), \( l_X = 0 \).  
  \( |L_{\text{NN}}| \neq |l_X| \), so orbital angular momentum is not conserved.  
  **This option is not allowed.**

### Conclusion
The parity condition is violated in **Option D**, making it the only option that is not permitted.
