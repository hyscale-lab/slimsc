Okay, so I've got this question about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, I remember learning about this in my physics class. Let me try to think through it step by step.

So, the problem is about an astronaut traveling from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth. The spacecraft is moving at a speed of 0.99999987 times the speed of light, which is super fast. The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find out how long the trip will take from their perspective. The options are given, and one of them is that the astronaut dies before reaching, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, wait. Oh right, time dilation is a concept from Einstein's theory of relativity. When you travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time moves slower for you relative to someone who's not moving (or moving at a different speed). So from the astronaut's point of view, their own time is the proper time, and Earth's time would be dilated.

But wait, the question is asking from the perspective of the astronaut. So we need to calculate the proper time experienced by the astronaut during the trip.

First, I think I need to find out the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. Oh, wait, I remember that the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 163,000 light-years away from Earth. Yeah, that's a rough figure I've come across before.

So distance, d = 163,000 light-years. The speed is v = 0.99999987*c. So the time taken from Earth's frame of reference would be t = d / v. But wait, the astronaut's time is different because of time dilation. Oh wait, no, actually, the astronaut is on the spacecraft, so their own experienced time is the proper time τ (tau), which is shorter than the time measured in Earth's frame.

Wait, so the proper time τ is given by the equation involving the Lorentz factor gamma. The Lorentz factor gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.99999987*c, let's compute gamma.

Let me compute beta first, which is v/c. Beta is 0.99999987. So beta squared is (0.99999987)^2. Let me calculate that. Let's see, 0.99999987 is almost 1. So 1 minus beta squared would be 1 minus (0.99999987)^2. Hmm, but let me calculate this:

(0.99999987)^2 = (1 - 0.00000013)^2. Hmm, using the approximation (1 - x)^2 ≈ 1 - 2x when x is very small. So 1 - 2*(0.00000013) = 0.99999974. So 1 - beta² = 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026. So sqrt(1 - beta²) would be sqrt(0.00000026). Let me compute that. The square root of 0.00000026 is approximately sqrt(2.6e-7). The square root of 2.6 is about 1.612, and sqrt(1e-7) is 1e-3.5, which is 3.16e-4. So 1.612 * 3.16e-4 ≈ 5.09e-4. So sqrt(0.00000026) ≈ 0.000509. Therefore, gamma is 1 / 0.000509 ≈ 1964. So gamma is approximately 1964.

Wait, but wait, let me compute this more accurately. Alternatively, maybe I should compute 1 - (0.99999987)^2. Let me compute 0.99999987 squared. Let's see, 0.99999987 is 1 - 1.3e-7. Squaring that gives 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2. The (1.3e-7)^2 is negligible, so approximately 1 - 2.6e-7. So 1 - beta^2 ≈ 2.6e-7.

Then sqrt(1 - beta^2) is sqrt(2.6e-7) = sqrt(2.6)*1e-3.5 (since 1e-7 is (1e-3.5)^2). Wait, 1e-3.5 is 3.16e-4. So sqrt(2.6) is about 1.612. So 1.612 * 3.16e-4 ≈ 5.09e-4. So gamma is 1 / 5.09e-4 ≈ 1964. So gamma is approximately 1964.

So the proper time tau is equal to t_earth / gamma, where t_earth is the time measured on Earth. Wait, no. Proper time is the time experienced by the traveler, so it's t_earth multiplied by sqrt(1 - beta^2). Because tau = t * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). Alternatively, tau = t_earth * sqrt(1 - beta^2) = t_earth / gamma.

But wait, wait. Let me get this right. The time experienced by the astronaut (proper time) is given by tau = t_earth * sqrt(1 - beta^2). So I need to compute t_earth first.

t_earth is the time taken from Earth's frame, which is distance divided by speed. Distance is 163,000 light-years. Speed is 0.99999987*c. So time is (163,000 ly) / (0.99999987 c). Since one light-year per year is the speed of light, so in Earth years, that's t_earth = 163000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163000 years.

Wait, wait, let me compute 163000 divided by approximately 1 (since 0.99999987 is very close to 1). So approximately 163000 / 1 = 163000 years. But considering the denominator is 0.99999987, which is just a tiny bit less than 1, so the actual t_earth would be a bit more than 163,000 years. But for approximation, let's take it as roughly 163,000 years. So t_earth ≈ 163,000 years.

So the proper time tau is t_earth * sqrt(1 - beta^2). So tau ≈ 163000 years * sqrt(2.6e-7), which is 163000 * 5.09e-4. Let's compute that.

5.09e-4 is 0.000509. So 163000 * 0.000509. Let me compute 163000 * 0.0005 = 163000 * 5e-4 = 163000 * 0.0005 = 81.5. And 163000 * 0.000009= approximately 1.467. So adding them together, 81.5 + 1.467 = about 82.967 years. So approximately 83 years.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my calculations. So 163000 * 0.000509. Let me compute 163000 * 0.0005 = 81.5. Then 163000 * 0.000009 = 1.467. So total is 81.5 + 1.467 = 82.967, so about 83 years.

Alternatively, I can think of it as 163000 * 5.09e-4 = 163000 * 5.09 * 1e-4. 1e-4 is 0.0001. So 163000 * 5.09 * 0.0001 = (163000 * 0.0001) *5.09. 163000 * 0.0001 is 16.3. 16.3 *5.09 ≈ 16.3 *5 =81.5, plus 16.3 *0.09=1.467. So again, about 82.967 years.

So the astronaut would experience about 83 years. Now, the astronaut is 22 years old. So they would be 22 + 83 = 105 years old upon arrival. Wait, but the average lifetime of these aliens is 150 years. So 105 is less than 150, so they would survive. So option A says the astronaut will die before reaching, which is not the case. So the correct answer is not A.

The options are: A) die before, B)72, C)81, D)77. So approximately 83, which is close to 81 (option C) or 82, which isn't an option. Wait, but perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, maybe I should compute the gamma factor more accurately. Because I approximated gamma as about 1964, but perhaps a better calculation would change the result a bit.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for proper time differently. Another approach is to calculate the time experienced by the astronaut using the time dilation formula.

Wait, the time experienced (tau) is given by tau = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). But wait, another formula comes to mind: tau = t_earth * sqrt(1 - beta^2). Yes, that's the same thing.

Wait, but another way to compute this is to use the Lorentz factor gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2), so sqrt(1-beta^2) = 1/gamma. So tau = t_earth / gamma.

So t_earth is 163000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163000 years (since 0.99999987 is very close to 1). So t_earth ≈ 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,001 years (because dividing by something slightly less than 1 gives a slightly larger number). But for approximation, perhaps 163000 is a good enough estimate.

So gamma is about 1964. So tau = 163000 / 1964 ≈ let's compute that. 1964 times 80 is about 157,120. 1964 * 83 = 157,120 + 1964*3 = 157,120 +5,892= 162, 120+5,892=163,012? Wait, 1964*83 = ?

Wait, 1964 *80 =157,120, 1964*3=5,892. So 157,120 +5,892=163,012. So 1964 *83 =163,012. So 163,000 /1964 ≈83 - (12/1964)= ~83-0.006= approx 82.994 years. So about 83 years.

So the astronaut's experienced time is about 83 years. Now looking at the options, the closest is option C) 81 years, but wait, perhaps my gamma was an overestimation.

Wait, maybe I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me compute beta squared more precisely.

Beta is 0.99999987. So beta squared is (0.99999987)^2. Let's compute this accurately.

(0.99999987)^2 = (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 = 1 - 2*1.3e-7 + (1.3e-7)^2. The (1.3e-7)^2 is negligible, so 1 - 2.6e-7 = 0.99999974. So 1 - beta^2 is 2.6e-7. So sqrt(1 - beta^2) is sqrt(2.6e-7) = approximately 5.099e-4.

So gamma is 1 / 5.099e-4 ≈ 1961. So gamma is approximately 1961.

So tau = t_earth / gamma = (163000) / 1961 ≈ let's compute that. 1961 *83 =1961*80=156,880. 1961*3=5,883. Total 156,880 +5,883=162,763. So 1961 *83=162,763. So 163,000 - 162,763=237. So 237 /1961 ≈0.121. So 83.121 years.

So the astronaut would experience roughly 83.12 years. But looking at the options, the closest is option C) 81, but that's a bit off. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the time_earth.

Wait, the distance is 163,000 light-years, but is that correct? Wait, I think the actual distance is about 163,000 light-years. So t_earth is (163000 ly) / (0.99999987c). Since 1 ly per year is c, so t_earth is (163000) / 0.99999987 ≈163000.023 years. So about 163,000 years.

So, tau= t_earth / gamma = 163000 / 1961 ≈83.12 years. So the astronaut would be 22 + 83 =105 years old upon arrival. Since their average lifetime is 150 years, they would survive, so option A is incorrect.

Now, looking at the options, the closest is option C)81, but that's about 2 years off. Hmm. Maybe the approximation for gamma is a bit off, or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait another approach: maybe using the formula for time dilation in terms of velocity. The time experienced by the astronaut is tau = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2).

So t_earth is 163000 / (0.99999987) ≈163000.023 years.

So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2) = sqrt(2.6e-7)≈5.099e-4.

So tau=163000.023 *5.099e-4 ≈ let's compute that.

163000 *5.099e-4 =163000 *0.0005099= approx 83.12 years.

Hmm, same as before.

But the options don't have 83, but option C is 81, which is near.

Wait, perhaps considering the distance is 163,000 light-years, and the speed is 0.99999987 c, the time from Earth's frame is t_earth = 163000 /0.99999987 ≈163000 * (1/(1 - 1.3e-7)).

Using the approximation 1/(1-x) ≈1 +x for small x, so 1/(1 -1.3e-7) ≈1 +1.3e-7. So t_earth ≈163000*(1 +1.3e-7) =163000 + 163000*1.3e-7.

163000 *1.3e-7 = (163000 *1.3) *1e-7. 163000 *1.3= 211,900. So 211,900 *1e-7 = 0.02119 years. So t_earth ≈163000.0212 years. So about 163,000.021 years.

So tau= t_earth * sqrt(1 - beta^2) =163000.021 *5.099e-4 ≈ (163000 *5.099e-4) + (0.021 *5.099e-4).

163000 *5.099e-4 is 83.12, as before. 0.021 *5.099e-4 is about 0.0000107. So tau≈83.1201 years. So about 83.12 years.

But the options don't have 83. So why is this?

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated gamma. Let me recompute gamma more accurately.

Compute 1 - beta^2: beta=0.99999987, beta^2=0.99999987^2.

Compute 0.99999987^2:

= (1 - 1.3e-7)^2

=1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2

=1 - 2.6e-7 + 1.69e-14.

So 1 - beta^2 = 2.6e-7 -1.69e-14 ≈2.6e-7.

So sqrt(1-beta^2)=sqrt(2.6e-7).

What's sqrt(2.6)=1.612, so sqrt(2.6e-7)=1.612e-3.5.

Wait, 1e-7 is (1e-3.5)^2. So 1e-3.5 is ~3.16e-4. So 1.612 *3.16e-4 = 5.09e-4 as before.

So gamma=1/(5.09e-4)=1961. So that part was correct.

Hmm, maybe the actual distance is a bit less than 163,000 light-years? Wait, I thought the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 to 200,000 light-years away. But maybe the exact figure is 163,000. But perhaps I should use 160,000 for approximation.

Wait, but the problem says, 'average lifetime is 150 years' and the astronaut is 22. So 22 +83=105, which is less than 150, so the astronaut would live.

So the options are A says the astronaut dies, which is not the case. So the correct answer is either B, C, or D.

But wait the options given are A, B, C, D with C being 81 and D 77. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier. Let me think differently. Maybe the distance is not 163,000 light-years but something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the gamma factor is larger, making the proper time shorter.

Wait, gamma is 1/sqrt(1-beta^2) = 1/(sqrt(2.6e-7))= approx 1961.

Wait, maybe I should compute using more precise values.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using the formula for time experienced:

tau = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2).

So, tau = (d / v) * sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).

But since d is 163,000 ly, and v is 0.99999987 c, t_earth = d/(v) = 163000 / 0.99999987 ≈163000 years (practically), because 0.99999987 is so close to 1.

So tau = (163000) * sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2) ≈163000 * sqrt(2.6e-7).

Which is 163000 * 5.09e-4 ≈83.1 years.

Hmm, so the answer should be about 83, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct option is not among them, but given the options, the closest is C)81.

Alternatively, perhaps the distance is 163,000 parsecs, not light-years. Oh wait, no, that would make no sense because parsecs are closer. Hmm, no, the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 163,000 light-years away.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the actual time more accurately.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects using a different approximation for gamma. Alternatively, perhaps the problem isn't using the exact distance but a different figure.

Wait, another approach. The Lorentz factor gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). With v=0.99999987 c.

So v = 0.99999987 c.

So beta =0.99999987.

So 1-beta = 1.3e-7.

Wait, perhaps using the approximation for sqrt(1 - beta^2):

sqrt(1 - beta²) = sqrt( (1 - beta)(1 + beta) ) ) = sqrt( (1.3e-7)(1.99999974) ) ) ≈ sqrt( (1.3e-7)*2 ) ) = sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈5.099e-4.

So that part is correct. So gamma=1961.

So tau= t_earth / gamma= (163000 / 0.99999987) /1961 ≈ (163000 ) /1961 ≈83.12.

So the astronaut's experienced time is about 83 years.

But the options don't have 83. So what's the next step? Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) Astronaut dies before reaching. (No, they'd be 105, which is less than 150.)

B)72 years.

C)81 years.

D)77 years.

So the closest is C)81.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try to compute 163000 / 1961 more accurately.

1961 *83 = 1961*(80+3) = 1961*80=156,880 +1961*3=5,883 → total 162,763.

So 1961 *83 =162,763. The numerator is 163,000.

So 163,000 -162,763=237. So 237/1961= 0.121 years. So 83.121 years.

So about 83.1 years. But the option C is 81, which is a bit off. But perhaps the problem expects an approximate calculation that gives around 81.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes t_earth is 163,000 / (0.99999987) ≈163000 years, and then the proper time is t_earth * sqrt(1 - beta^2) = 163000 *5.09e-4 = 83 years.

But none of the options match 83. So perhaps the intended answer is C)81, perhaps due to using a different approximation for gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects using a different method, like the relativistic velocity addition or something else, but I can't think of another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the distance is not 163,000 light-years but something else. Wait, I think the actual distance is about 170,000 light-years. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let's say the distance is 170,000 ly. Then t_earth would be 170,000 /0.99999987 ≈170,000 years. Then tau=170000 *5.09e-4=170000 *0.000509=86.53 years. Still no option for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different approximation for gamma.

Wait, perhaps using a more precise calculation for gamma. Let me compute beta=0.99999987.

Compute beta squared: (0.99999987)^2.

Let me compute this more accurately.

0.99999987 ×0.99999987.

Let me compute 1e8 - 13, all multiplied by 1e-8.

Wait, perhaps a better way: 0.99999987 = 1 - 1.3e-7.

So (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 =1 - 2*1.3e-7 + (1.3e-7)^2.

Which is 1 - 2.6e-7 + 1.69e-14 ≈0.9999997400000169.

So 1 - beta squared is 2.6e-7 -1.69e-14 ≈2.6e-7.

So sqrt(2.6e-7)=~5.099e-4 as before.

So gamma is 1961.

So perhaps the intended answer is 83, but since it's not an option, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem states that the astronaut is 22 and wants to know how old they are upon arrival, but the question asks how long it takes from their perspective, which is tau. So the answer is 83 years. But since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is C)81.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using the time experienced as t_earth * (1 - (v^2)/(2c^2)), which is an approximation for small v. But in this case, v is 0.99999987 c, which is not small. So that approximation isn't valid.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the distance as the proper distance, but I think that's not the case.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the gamma factor is calculated using v=0.99999987 c, so gamma is around 1964. So 163000 /1964 ≈83.12. So the result is 83 years.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the intended answer is C)81, and the given options have a typo, or perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes that the time experienced is t_earth × (1 - v/c), but that's not correct. Because (1 - v/c) would be 1.3e-7, which is way too small.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's look at the options again. The options are 72, 77,81, etc. The closest to 83 is 81 (option C). So perhaps the intended answer is C)81.

But wait, perhaps the problem expects using a different formula. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using the Lorentz factor for time. Alternatively, perhaps the time from the astronaut's perspective is length contraction.

Wait, the proper length is the distance in Earth's frame. So from the astronaut's frame, the distance is length-contracted. So the distance would be d' = d * sqrt(1 - beta^2).

So d' =163000 *5.09e-4 ≈163000 *0.000509 ≈82.967 light-years.

Then, the time experienced by the astronaut is d' /v =82.967 ly / 0.99999987 c = roughly 83 years.

Same as before.

So I think the correct answer is about 83 years, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is C)81. But wait, another possibility: perhaps I should compute t_earth as 163000 /0.99999987 = approximately 163,000.023 years. Then tau is (163000.023) *5.099e-4 ≈83.12 years.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is intended to use the approximation of gamma as 1999 or so, leading to tau=81 years. Alternatively, maybe I should compute gamma more precisely.

Let me compute gamma more accurately. Let me compute 1 - beta^2 more precisely.

Beta is 0.99999987.

So beta^2 = (0.99999987)^2.

Let me compute this using more precise steps.

Calculate 0.99999987 × 0.99999987.

We can compute it as:

= (1 - 1.3e-7) × (1 - 1.3e-7)

= 1 - 2×1.3e-7 + (1.3e-7)^2.

= 1 - 2.6e-7 + 1.69e-14.

So 1 - beta^2 = 2.6e-7 - 1.69e-14 ≈2.6e-7.

So sqrt(1 - beta^2) is sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈5.099e-4.

So gamma=1/5.099e-4= approx 1961. So that's correct.

Thus, tau=163000 / gamma =163000/1961≈83.12 years.

But since this isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is C)81. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem considers only the time from the astronaut's perspective without considering acceleration or other relativistic effects. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, I think I have to go with the calculation. The time experienced is approximately 83 years, but the closest option is C)81. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the average time without considering that the astronaut ages 22 +83 =105, but the question is only asking how long it takes from their perspective, which is 83 years.

But the options don't have that. So I'm a bit confused.

Wait, looking at the options again:

A) astronaut dies before arrival. No, 105<150.

B)72 years.

C)81 years.

D)77 years.

So perhaps the intended answer is C)81, assuming gamma is 1960 and 163000 /1960= approx 83.1, but perhaps the problem expects to round to 81.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different distance. For example, if the distance was about 160,000 ly, then 160000 /1961≈81.48, which would round to 81. So perhaps that's the case.

Ah, that makes sense. So if the distance is approximately 160,000 ly instead of 163,000, then 160,000 /1961≈81.48 years, which would round to 81. So option C would be correct.

Wait, but the problem states the distance is the Large Magellanic Cloud, which is about 163,000 ly. But perhaps the problem uses 160,000 as an approximation.

So if d=160,000 ly, t_earth=160000 /0.99999987≈160,000.016 years.

Then tau= t_earth * sqrt(1 - beta^2)=160,000.016 *5.099e-4≈81.48 years.

So the astronaut would experience about 81.5 years, which would be option C)81.

That makes sense. So perhaps the intended answer is C)81.

So the conclusion is that the astronaut will experience approximately 81 years of time, so the answer is C.

To determine how long the astronaut will experience the journey, we use the concept of time dilation from Einstein's theory of relativity. The astronaut's proper time, \( \tau \), is related to the time measured in Earth's frame, \( t_{\text{Earth}} \), by the equation:

\[
\tau = t_{\text{Earth}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \beta^2}
\]

where \( \beta = v/c \) and \( v = 0.99999987c \). The distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud is approximately \( 163,000 \) light-years. The time measured in Earth's frame is:

\[
t_{\text{Earth}} = \frac{\text{distance}}{v} = \frac{163,000}{0.99999987} \approx 163,000 \, \text{years}.
\]

The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}}.
\]

Since \( \beta = 0.99999987 \), we calculate \( \beta^2 \approx 0.99999974 \), and thus:

\[
1 - \beta^2 \approx 2.6 \times 10^{-7}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
\sqrt{1 - \beta^2} \approx \sqrt{2.6 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 5.09 \times 10^{-4}.
\]

Thus, \( \gamma \approx 1 / 5.09 \times 10^{-4} \approx 1961 \). The proper time experienced by the astronaut is:

\[
\tau = \frac{t_{\text{Earth}}}{\gamma} = \frac{163,000}{1961} \approx 83.12 \, \text{years}.
\]

This means the astronaut would experience approximately 83 years of travel time. However, the options provided do not include 83. The closest option is **C) 81 years**, which likely accounts for rounding or slight approximations in the problem setup.

The astronaut's age upon arrival would be \( 22 + 83 = 105 \), which is less than their average lifetime of 150 years, so they would survive the journey. Therefore, option A ("The astronaut will die before reaching Earth") is incorrect.

Among the remaining options, the best match is **C) 81 years**, which aligns with the calculations if the distance is approximated slightly lower (e.g., 160,000 light-years instead of 163,000 light-years). This adjustment would yield:

\[
\tau = \frac{160,000}{1961} \approx 81.5 \, \text{years}.
\]

Thus, the intended answer is **C) 81 years**.

Answer: C

Okay, so I've got this question about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, I remember learning about this in my physics class. Let me try to think through it step by step.

So, the problem is about an astronaut traveling from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth. The spacecraft is moving at a speed of 0.99999987 times the speed of light, which is super fast. The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find out how long the trip will take from their perspective. The options are given, and one of them is that the astronaut dies before reaching, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, wait. Oh right, time dilation is a concept from Einstein's theory of relativity. When you travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time moves slower for you relative to someone who's not moving (or moving at a different speed). So from the astronaut's point of view, their own time is the proper time, and Earth's time would be dilated.

But wait, the question is asking from the perspective of the astronaut. So we need to calculate the proper time experienced by the astronaut during the trip.

First, I think I need to find out the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. Oh, wait, I remember that the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 163,000 light-years away from Earth. Yeah, that's a rough figure I've come across before.

So distance, d = 163,000 light-years. The speed is v = 0.99999987*c. So the time taken from Earth's frame of reference would be t = d / v. But wait, the astronaut's time is different because of time dilation. Oh wait, no, actually, the astronaut is on the spacecraft, so their own experienced time is the proper time τ (tau), which is shorter than the time measured in Earth's frame.

Wait, so the proper time τ is given by the equation involving the Lorentz factor gamma. The Lorentz factor gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.99999987*c, let's compute gamma.

Let me compute beta first, which is v/c. Beta is 0.99999987. So beta squared is (0.99999987)^2. Let me calculate that. Let's see, 0.99999987 is almost 1. So 1 minus beta squared would be 1 minus (0.99999987)^2. Hmm, but let me calculate this:

(0.99999987)^2 = (1 - 0.00000013)^2. Hmm, using the approximation (1 - x)^2 ≈ 1 - 2x when x is very small. So 1 - 2*(0.00000013) = 0.99999974. So 1 - beta² = 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026. So sqrt(1 - beta²) would be sqrt(0.00000026). Let me compute that. The square root of 0.00000026 is approximately sqrt(2.6e-7). The square root of 2.6 is about 1.612, and sqrt(1e-7) is 1e-3.5, which is 3.16e-4. So 1.612 * 3.16e-4 ≈ 5.09e-4. So sqrt(0.00000026) ≈ 0.000509. Therefore, gamma is 1 / 0.000509 ≈ 1964. So gamma is approximately 1964.

Wait, but wait, let me compute this more accurately. Alternatively, maybe I should compute 1 - (0.99999987)^2. Let me compute 0.99999987 squared. Let's see, 0.99999987 is 1 - 1.3e-7. Squaring that gives 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2. The (1.3e-7)^2 is negligible, so approximately 1 - 2.6e-7. So 1 - beta^2 ≈ 2.6e-7.

Then sqrt(1 - beta^2) is sqrt(2.6e-7) = sqrt(2.6)*1e-3.5 (since 1e-7 is (1e-3.5)^2). Wait, 1e-3.5 is 3.16e-4. So sqrt(2.6) is about 1.612. So 1.612 * 3.16e-4 ≈ 5.09e-4. So gamma is 1 / 5.09e-4 ≈ 1964. So gamma is approximately 1964.

So the proper time tau is equal to t_earth / gamma, where t_earth is the time measured on Earth. Wait, no. Proper time is the time experienced by the traveler, so it's t_earth multiplied by sqrt(1 - beta^2). Because tau = t * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). Alternatively, tau = t_earth * sqrt(1 - beta^2) = t_earth / gamma.

But wait, wait. Let me get this right. The time experienced by the astronaut (proper time) is given by tau = t_earth * sqrt(1 - beta^2). So I need to compute t_earth first.

t_earth is the time taken from Earth's frame, which is distance divided by speed. Distance is 163,000 light-years. Speed is 0.99999987*c. So time is (163,000 ly) / (0.99999987 c). Since one light-year per year is the speed of light, so in Earth years, that's t_earth = 163000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163000 years.

Wait, wait, let me compute 163000 divided by approximately 1 (since 0.99999987 is very close to 1). So approximately 163000 / 1 = 163000 years. But considering the denominator is 0.99999987, which is just a tiny bit less than 1, so the actual t_earth would be a bit more than 163,000 years. But for approximation, let's take it as roughly 163,000 years. So t_earth ≈ 163,000 years.

So the proper time tau is t_earth * sqrt(1 - beta^2). So tau ≈ 163000 years * sqrt(2.6e-7), which is 163000 * 5.09e-4. Let's compute that.

5.09e-4 is 0.000509. So 163000 * 0.000509. Let me compute 163000 * 0.0005 = 163000 * 5e-4 = 163000 * 0.0005 = 81.5. And 163000 * 0.000009= approximately 1.467. So adding them together, 81.5 + 1.467 = about 82.967 years. So approximately 83 years.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my calculations. So 163000 * 0.000509. Let me compute 163000 * 0.0005 = 81.5. Then 163000 * 0.000009 = 1.467. So total is 81.5 + 1.467 = 82.967, so about 83 years.

Alternatively, I can think of it as 163000 * 5.09e-4 = 163000 * 5.09 * 1e-4. 1e-4 is 0.0001. So 163000 * 5.09 * 0.0001 = (163000 * 0.0001) *5.09. 163000 * 0.0001 is 16.3. 16.3 *5.09 ≈ 16.3 *5 =81.5, plus 16.3 *0.09=1.467. So again, about 82.967 years.

So the astronaut would experience about 83 years. Now, the astronaut is 22 years old. So they would be 22 + 83 = 105 years old upon arrival. Wait, but the average lifetime of these aliens is 150 years. So 105 is less than 150, so they would survive. So option A says the astronaut will die before reaching, which is not the case. So the correct answer is not A.

The options are: A) die before, B)72, C)81, D)77. So approximately 83, which is close to 81 (option C) or 82, which isn't an option. Wait, but perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, maybe I should compute the gamma factor more accurately. Because I approximated gamma as about 1964, but perhaps a better calculation would change the result a bit.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for proper time differently. Another approach is to calculate the time experienced by the astronaut using the time dilation formula.

Wait, the time experienced (tau) is given by tau = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). But wait, another formula comes to mind: tau = t_earth * sqrt(1 - beta^2). Yes, that's the same thing.

Wait, but another way to compute this is to use the Lorentz factor gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2), so sqrt(1-beta^2) = 1/gamma. So tau = t_earth / gamma.

So t_earth is 163000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163000 years (since 0.99999987 is very close to 1). So t_earth ≈ 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,001 years (because dividing by something slightly less than 1 gives a slightly larger number). But for approximation, perhaps 163000 is a good enough estimate.

So gamma is about 1964. So tau = 163000 / 1964 ≈ let's compute that. 1964 times 80 is about 157,120. 1964 * 83 = 157,120 + 1964*3 = 157,120 +5,892= 162, 120+5,892=163,012? Wait, 1964*83 = ?

Wait, 1964 *80 =157,120, 1964*3=5,892. So 157,120 +5,892=163,012. So 1964 *83 =163,012. So 163,000 /1964 ≈83 - (12/1964)= ~83-0.006= approx 82.994 years. So about 83 years.

So the astronaut's experienced time is about 83 years. Now looking at the options, the closest is option C) 81 years, but wait, perhaps my gamma was an overestimation.

Wait, maybe I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me compute beta squared more precisely.

Beta is 0.99999987. So beta squared is (0.99999987)^2. Let's compute this accurately.

(0.99999987)^2 = (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 = 1 - 2*1.3e-7 + (1.3e-7)^2. The (1.3e-7)^2 is negligible, so 1 - 2.6e-7 = 0.99999974. So 1 - beta^2 is 2.6e-7. So sqrt(1 - beta^2) is sqrt(2.6e-7) = approximately 5.099e-4.

So gamma is 1 / 5.099e-4 ≈ 1961. So gamma is approximately 1961.

So tau = t_earth / gamma = (163000) / 1961 ≈ let's compute that. 1961 *83 =1961*80=156,880. 1961*3=5,883. Total 156,880 +5,883=162,763. So 1961 *83=162,763. So 163,000 - 162,763=237. So 237 /1961 ≈0.121. So 83.121 years.

So the astronaut would experience roughly 83.12 years. But looking at the options, the closest is option C) 81, but that's a bit off. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the time_earth.

Wait, the distance is 163,000 light-years, but is that correct? Wait, I think the actual distance is about 163,000 light-years. So t_earth is (163000 ly) / (0.99999987c). Since 1 ly per year is c, so t_earth is (163000) / 0.99999987 ≈163000.023 years. So about 163,000 years.

So, tau= t_earth / gamma = 163000 / 1961 ≈83.12 years. So the astronaut would be 22 + 83 =105 years old upon arrival. Since their average lifetime is 150 years, they would survive, so option A is incorrect.

Now, looking at the options, the closest is option C)81, but that's about 2 years off. Hmm. Maybe the approximation for gamma is a bit off, or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait another approach: maybe using the formula for time dilation in terms of velocity. The time experienced by the astronaut is tau = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2).

So t_earth is 163000 / (0.99999987) ≈163000.023 years.

So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2) = sqrt(2.6e-7)≈5.099e-4.

So tau=163000.023 *5.099e-4 ≈ let's compute that.

163000 *5.099e-4 =163000 *0.0005099= approx 83.12 years.

Hmm, same as before.

But the options don't have 83, but option C is 81, which is near.

Wait, perhaps considering the distance is 163,000 light-years, and the speed is 0.99999987 c, the time from Earth's frame is t_earth = 163000 /0.99999987 ≈163000 * (1/(1 - 1.3e-7)).

Using the approximation 1/(1-x) ≈1 +x for small x, so 1/(1 -1.3e-7) ≈1 +1.3e-7. So t_earth ≈163000*(1 +1.3e-7) =163000 + 163000*1.3e-7.

163000 *1.3e-7 = (163000 *1.3) *1e-7. 163000 *1.3= 211,900. So 211,900 *1e-7 = 0.02119 years. So t_earth ≈163000.0212 years. So about 163,000.021 years.

So tau= t_earth * sqrt(1 - beta^2) =163000.021 *5.099e-4 ≈ (163000 *5.099e-4) + (0.021 *5.099e-4).

163000 *5.099e-4 is 83.12, as before. 0.021 *5.099e-4 is about 0.0000107. So tau≈83.1201 years. So about 83.12 years.

But the options don't have 83. So why is this?

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated gamma. Let me recompute gamma more accurately.

Compute 1 - beta^2: beta=0.99999987, beta^2=0.99999987^2.

Compute 0.99999987^2:

= (1 - 1.3e-7)^2

=1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2

=1 - 2.6e-7 + 1.69e-14.

So 1 - beta^2 = 2.6e-7 -1.69e-14 ≈2.6e-7.

So sqrt(1-beta^2)=sqrt(2.6e-7).

What's sqrt(2.6)=1.612, so sqrt(2.6e-7)=1.612e-3.5.

Wait, 1e-7 is (1e-3.5)^2. So 1e-3.5 is ~3.16e-4. So 1.612 *3.16e-4 = 5.09e-4 as before.

So gamma=1/(5.09e-4)=1961. So that part was correct.

Hmm, maybe the actual distance is a bit less than 163,000 light-years? Wait, I thought the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 to 200,000 light-years away. But maybe the exact figure is 163,000. But perhaps I should use 160,000 for approximation.

Wait, but the problem says, 'average lifetime is 150 years' and the astronaut is 22. So 22 +83=105, which is less than 150, so the astronaut would live.

So the options are A says the astronaut dies, which is not the case. So the correct answer is either B, C, or D.

But wait the options given are A, B, C, D with C being 81 and D 77. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier. Let me think differently. Maybe the distance is not 163,000 light-years but something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the gamma factor is larger, making the proper time shorter.

Wait, gamma is 1/sqrt(1-beta^2) = 1/(sqrt(2.6e-7))= approx 1961.

Wait, maybe I should compute using more precise values.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using the formula for time experienced:

tau = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2).

So, tau = (d / v) * sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).

But since d is 163,000 ly, and v is 0.99999987 c, t_earth = d/(v) = 163000 / 0.99999987 ≈163000 years (practically), because 0.99999987 is so close to 1.

So tau = (163000) * sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2) ≈163000 * sqrt(2.6e-7).

Which is 163000 * 5.09e-4 ≈83.1 years.

Hmm, so the answer should be about 83, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct option is not among them, but given the options, the closest is C)81.

Alternatively, perhaps the distance is 163,000 parsecs, not light-years. Oh wait, no, that would make no sense because parsecs are closer. Hmm, no, the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 163,000 light-years away.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the actual time more accurately.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects using a different approximation for gamma. Alternatively, perhaps the problem isn't using the exact distance but a different figure.

Wait, another approach. The Lorentz factor gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). With v=0.99999987 c.

So v = 0.99999987 c.

So beta =0.99999987.

So 1-beta = 1.3e-7.

Wait, perhaps using the approximation for sqrt(1 - beta^2):

sqrt(1 - beta²) = sqrt( (1 - beta)(1 + beta) ) ) = sqrt( (1.3e-7)(1.99999974) ) ) ≈ sqrt( (1.3e-7)*2 ) ) = sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈5.099e-4.

So that part is correct. So gamma=1961.

So tau= t_earth / gamma= (163000 / 0.99999987) /1961 ≈ (163000 ) /1961 ≈83.12.

So the astronaut's experienced time is about 83 years.

But the options don't have 83. So what's the next step? Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) Astronaut dies before reaching. (No, they'd be 105, which is less than 150.)

B)72 years.

C)81 years.

D)77 years.

So the closest is C)81.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try to compute 163000 / 1961 more accurately.

1961 *83 = 1961*(80+3) = 1961*80=156,880 +1961*3=5,883 → total 162,763.

So 1961 *83 =162,763. The numerator is 163,000.

So 163,000 -162,763=237. So 237/1961= 0.121 years. So 83.121 years.

So about 83.1 years. But the option C is 81, which is a bit off. But perhaps the problem expects an approximate calculation that gives around 81.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes t_earth is 163,000 / (0.99999987) ≈163000 years, and then the proper time is t_earth * sqrt(1 - beta^2) = 163000 *5.09e-4 = 83 years.

But none of the options match 83. So perhaps the intended answer is C)81, perhaps due to using a different approximation for gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects using a different method, like the relativistic velocity addition or something else, but I can't think of another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the distance is not 163,000 light-years but something else. Wait, I think the actual distance is about 170,000 light-years. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let's say the distance is 170,000 ly. Then t_earth would be 170,000 /0.99999987 ≈170,000 years. Then tau=170000 *5.09e-4=170000 *0.000509=86.53 years. Still no option for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different approximation for gamma.

Wait, perhaps using a more precise calculation for gamma. Let me compute beta=0.99999987.

Compute beta squared: (0.99999987)^2.

Let me compute this more accurately.

0.99999987 ×0.99999987.

Let me compute 1e8 - 13, all multiplied by 1e-8.

Wait, perhaps a better way: 0.99999987 = 1 - 1.3e-7.

So (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 =1 - 2*1.3e-7 + (1.3e-7)^2.

Which is 1 - 2.6e-7 + 1.69e-14 ≈0.9999997400000169.

So 1 - beta squared is 2.6e-7 -1.69e-14 ≈2.6e-7.

So sqrt(2.6e-7)=~5.099e-4 as before.

So gamma is 1961.

So perhaps the intended answer is 83, but since it's not an option, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem states that the astronaut is 22 and wants to know how old they are upon arrival, but the question asks how long it takes from their perspective, which is tau. So the answer is 83 years. But since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is C)81.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using the time experienced as t_earth * (1 - (v^2)/(2c^2)), which is an approximation for small v. But in this case, v is 0.99999987 c, which is not small. So that approximation isn't valid.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the distance as the proper distance, but I think that's not the case.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the gamma factor is calculated using v=0.99999987 c, so gamma is around 1964. So 163000 /1964 ≈83.12. So the result is 83 years.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the intended answer is C)81, and the given options have a typo, or perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes that the time experienced is t_earth × (1 - v/c), but that's not correct. Because (1 - v/c) would be 1.3e-7, which is way too small.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's look at the options again. The options are 72, 77,81, etc. The closest to 83 is 81 (option C). So perhaps the intended answer is C)81.

But wait, perhaps the problem expects using a different formula. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using the Lorentz factor for time. Alternatively, perhaps the time from the astronaut's perspective is length contraction.

Wait, the proper length is the distance in Earth's frame. So from the astronaut's frame, the distance is length-contracted. So the distance would be d' = d * sqrt(1 - beta^2).

So d' =163000 *5.09e-4 ≈163000 *0.000509 ≈82.967 light-years.

Then, the time experienced by the astronaut is d' /v =82.967 ly / 0.99999987 c = roughly 83 years.

Same as before.

So I think the correct answer is about 83 years, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is C)81. But wait, another possibility: perhaps I should compute t_earth as 163000 /0.99999987 = approximately 163,000.023 years. Then tau is (163000.023) *5.099e-4 ≈83.12 years.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is intended to use the approximation of gamma as 1999 or so, leading to tau=81 years. Alternatively, maybe I should compute gamma more precisely.

Let me compute gamma more accurately. Let me compute 1 - beta^2 more precisely.

Beta is 0.99999987.

So beta^2 = (0.99999987)^2.

Let me compute this using more precise steps.

Calculate 0.99999987 × 0.99999987.

We can compute it as:

= (1 - 1.3e-7) × (1 - 1.3e-7)

= 1 - 2×1.3e-7 + (1.3e-7)^2.

= 1 - 2.6e-7 + 1.69e-14.

So 1 - beta^2 = 2.6e-7 - 1.69e-14 ≈2.6e-7.

So sqrt(1 - beta^2) is sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈5.099e-4.

So gamma=1/5.099e-4= approx 1961. So that's correct.

Thus, tau=163000 / gamma =163000/1961≈83.12 years.

But since this isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is C)81. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem considers only the time from the astronaut's perspective without considering acceleration or other relativistic effects. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, I think I have to go with the calculation. The time experienced is approximately 83 years, but the closest option is C)81. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the average time without considering that the astronaut ages 22 +83 =105, but the question is only asking how long it takes from their perspective, which is 83 years.

But the options don't have that. So I'm a bit confused.

Wait, looking at the options again:

A) astronaut dies before arrival. No, 105<150.

B)72 years.

C)81 years.

D)77 years.

So perhaps the intended answer is C)81, assuming gamma is 1960 and 163000 /1960= approx 83.1, but perhaps the problem expects to round to 81.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different distance. For example, if the distance was about 160,000 ly, then 160000 /1961≈81.48, which would round to 81. So perhaps that's the case.

Ah, that makes sense. So if the distance is approximately 160,000 ly instead of 163,000, then 160,000 /1961≈81.48 years, which would round to 81. So option C would be correct.

Wait, but the problem states the distance is the Large Magellanic Cloud, which is about 163,000 ly. But perhaps the problem uses 160,000 as an approximation.

So if d=160,000 ly, t_earth=160000 /0.99999987≈160,000.016 years.

Then tau= t_earth * sqrt(1 - beta^2)=160,000.016 *5.099e-4≈81.48 years.

So the astronaut would experience about 81.5 years, which would be option C)81.

That makes sense. So perhaps the intended answer is C)81.

So the conclusion is that the astronaut will experience approximately 81 years of time, so the answer is C.


To determine how long the astronaut will experience the journey, we use the concept of time dilation from Einstein's theory of relativity. The astronaut's proper time, \( \tau \), is related to the time measured in Earth's frame, \( t_{\text{Earth}} \), by the equation:

\[
\tau = t_{\text{Earth}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \beta^2}
\]

where \( \beta = v/c \) and \( v = 0.99999987c \). The distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud is approximately \( 163,000 \) light-years. The time measured in Earth's frame is:

\[
t_{\text{Earth}} = \frac{\text{distance}}{v} = \frac{163,000}{0.99999987} \approx 163,000 \, \text{years}.
\]

The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}}.
\]

Since \( \beta = 0.99999987 \), we calculate \( \beta^2 \approx 0.99999974 \), and thus:

\[
1 - \beta^2 \approx 2.6 \times 10^{-7}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
\sqrt{1 - \beta^2} \approx \sqrt{2.6 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 5.09 \times 10^{-4}.
\]

Thus, \( \gamma \approx 1 / 5.09 \times 10^{-4} \approx 1961 \). The proper time experienced by the astronaut is:

\[
\tau = \frac{t_{\text{Earth}}}{\gamma} = \frac{163,000}{1961} \approx 83.12 \, \text{years}.
\]

This means the astronaut would experience approximately 83 years of travel time. However, the options provided do not include 83. The closest option is **C) 81 years**, which likely accounts for rounding or slight approximations in the problem setup.

The astronaut's age upon arrival would be \( 22 + 83 = 105 \), which is less than their average lifetime of 150 years, so they would survive the journey. Therefore, option A ("The astronaut will die before reaching Earth") is incorrect.

Among the remaining options, the best match is **C) 81 years**, which aligns with the calculations if the distance is approximated slightly lower (e.g., 160,000 light-years instead of 163,000 light-years). This adjustment would yield:

\[
\tau = \frac{160,000}{1961} \approx 81.5 \, \text{years}.
\]

Thus, the intended answer is **C) 81 years**.
