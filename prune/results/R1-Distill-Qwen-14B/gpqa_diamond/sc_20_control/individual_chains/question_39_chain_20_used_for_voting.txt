Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a go.

The question says we have a bunch of identical systems, each with a particle that moves along the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Oh wait, i is the imaginary unit, right (sqrt(-1)).

When they measure the position of the particles, none are found outside the region x between 1 and 3. So the wave function must be zero outside that interval. Wait, no, actually, the wave function squared gives the probability density. So the wave function itself isn't zero, but the probability is zero outside x=1 to 3.

Wait, no, the wave function might not be zero, but the probability amplitude has to be such that the particle is found only between 1 and 3. So the wave function must be zero outside that region. Because the wave function should be zero elsewhere to have zero probability.

Wait, but the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. That's for the region where the particle exists, which is between x=1 and x=3. So outside that region, the wave function must be zero. So perhaps the wave function is zero when x is less than 1 and greater than 3. So maybe the wave function is zero for x <1 and x>3, and the given expression applies between 1 and 3.

But wait, the wave function given is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So in the interval x between 1 and 3, the wave function is that. Otherwise, it's zero. Because the measurements only find the particles between 1 and 3, so their probability is zero elsewhere.

So the wave function ψ(x) is zero when x <1 or x>3, and equals (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i for 1 ≤ x ≤3.

But wait, wave functions must satisfy the normalization condition. So the integral of |ψ(x)|² from -infinity to infinity must equal 1. Since ψ is zero outside 1-3, the integral is from 1 to 3 of |ψ(x)|² dx.

Wait, but ψ(x) is a complex function. So the modulus squared would be [a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i]^2? Or wait, perhaps I should compute the magnitude squared correctly. Let me think.

The wave function is ψ(x) = A + B i, where A is real and B is real. Then |ψ|² = A² + B². So in this case, ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5 i. So A is a/(sqrt(1+x)), B is -0.5. Then |ψ(x)|² is [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (-0.5)^2.

So |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the square of a complex number is different. Wait, no, |ψ|² is ψ*ψ, where * is the complex conjugate. So ψ* = (a/(sqrt(1+x))) + 0.5i. Then ψ*ψ = [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5i)(-0.5i). Let's compute that.

Wait, no. Let me do it properly. ψ(x) = (a/(sqrt(1+x))) - 0.5i. So ψ*(x) is the complex conjugate, which is (a/(sqrt(1+x))) + 0.5i.

Then ψ*ψ is [(a/(sqrt(1+x)))]^2 + (a/(sqrt(1+x)))(0.5i) - (0.5i)(a/(sqrt(1+x))) ) + (0.5i)(-0.5i).

Wait, no, perhaps it's easier to multiply the two. Let me write it:

ψ(x) = A + B i, where A = a/(sqrt(1+x)), B = -0.5.

So ψ*ψ = (A + B i)(A - B i) = A² + B².

Because (A + Bi)(A - Bi) = A² - (Bi)^2 = A² + B² (since i² is -1).

So |ψ(x)|² = A² + B² = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

So |ψ(x)|² = a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, but for the normalization, we integrate |ψ|² from x=1 to x=3. But wait, wait. That can't be right because the integral would involve a term with 1/(1+x), which may diverge or something. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, wait, the wave function given is only valid between x=1 and x=3. So the probability distribution is only non-zero in that region. So the normalization condition is the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx = 1.

So let's compute that integral.

The integral is ∫ (from 1 to 3) [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

But wait, that would be the sum of two integrals:

a² ∫ (1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to 3 + 0.25 ∫1 dx from 1 to3.

Compute each part:

First integral: ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to3. Let me compute it.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x) + C.

So from 1 to3: ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So first term: a² * ln(2).

Second integral: ∫1 dx from 1 to3 is 3-1=2. So 0.25 *2=0.5.

So putting it together:

a² * ln(2) +0.5 = 1.

So a² * ln(2) = 0.5.

Then, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.5 /0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a² ≈0.7213. Then a is sqrt(0.7213) ≈0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is close.

So the value of 'a' is approximately 0.85.

To determine the value of \( a \), we start by analyzing the wave function provided:  
\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i, \quad \text{for } 1 \leq x \leq 3.
\]  
The wave function is zero outside this interval, as the particle is only found between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \). The normalization condition requires that the total probability is 1, meaning:  
\[
\int_{-\infty}^\infty |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1.
\]  
Since \( \psi(x) = 0 \) outside \( [1, 3] \), the integral reduces to:  
\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1.
\]  
The probability density is given by \( |\psi(x)|^2 = \psi^*(x)\psi(x) \). For \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \), the complex conjugate is \( \psi^*(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} + 0.5i \). Multiplying these gives:  
\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]  
The normalization condition becomes:  
\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]  
This integral splits into two parts:  
\[
a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx + 0.25 \int_{1}^{3} 1 dx = 1.
\]  
The first integral is:  
\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx = \ln(1+x) \Big|_{1}^{3} = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2).
\]  
The second integral is:  
\[
\int_{1}^{3} 1 dx = 3 - 1 = 2.
\]  
Substituting these results, the normalization condition becomes:  
\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.25 \cdot 2 = 1.
\]  
Simplifying:  
\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1 \implies a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \implies a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]  
Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):  
\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \implies a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849.
\]  
The closest option to this value is \( a = 0.85 \).

Then ψ*ψ is [(a/(sqrt(1+x)))]^2 + (a/(sqrt(1+x)))(0.5i) - (0.5i)(a/(sqrt(1+x))) ) + (0.5i)(-0.5i).

Wait, no, perhaps it's easier to multiply the two. Let me write it:

ψ(x) = A + B i, where A = a/(sqrt(1+x)), B = -0.5.

So ψ*ψ = (A + B i)(A - B i) = A² + B².

Because (A + Bi)(A - Bi) = A² - (Bi)^2 = A² + B² (since i² is -1).

So |ψ(x)|² = A² + B² = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

So |ψ(x)|² = a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

Compute each part:

First integral: ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to3. Let me compute it.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x) + C.

So from 1 to3: ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So first term: a² * ln(2).

Second integral: ∫1 dx from 1 to3 is 3-1=2. So 0.25 *2=0.5.

So putting it together:

a² * ln(2) +0.5 = 1.

So a² * ln(2) = 0.5.

Then, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.5 /0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a² ≈0.7213. Then a is sqrt(0.7213) ≈0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is close.

So the value of 'a' is approximately 0.85.
