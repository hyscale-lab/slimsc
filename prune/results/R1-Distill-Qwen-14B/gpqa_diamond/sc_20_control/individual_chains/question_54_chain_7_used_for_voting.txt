Okay, so I've got this question about ring-closing metathesis (RCM) and I'm trying to figure it out. I'm a bit rusty on my metathesis reactions, but I'll try to think it through.

The question asks for the starting material needed to synthesize 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene via RCM. The options are A, B, C, D, each being different octadienes.

First, I remember that ring-closing metathesis involves the redistribution of alkylidene groups between two alkenes, typically catalyzed by a transition metal like ruthenium or rhodium. The process forms a ring by connecting the two alkenes, releasing two alkanes as a byproduct.

So, the general idea is that each starting diene has two double bonds. The RCM will break and reform these double bonds in such a way that a ring is formed. The positions of the substituents (like isopropyl and methyl groups) are key here.

The target molecule is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. Let me draw that structure. Cyclohexene ring with substituents: at position 1, there's a double bond (between C1 and C2). Positions 3 and 4 have methyl groups, and position 5 has an isopropyl group.

Wait, cyclohexene has six members. So numbering starts at the double bond. In cyclohexene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the substituents are on C3, C4, and C5.

In the starting material, which is an octadiene, there are two double bonds. The RCM will connect the two alkenes to form the ring.

RCM typically involves two alkenes in the diene. The catalyst will break each double bond, swap the ends, and form a new double bond in the ring. So the positions of the double bonds in the starting material will determine where the ring forms.

Let me think about the general RCM mechanism. Suppose we have two alkenes, A and B, in the starting molecule. After RCM, they form a ring, with the new double bond somewhere in the ring. The catalyst facilitates the exchange, so the ends that were previously double bonds become single bonds, and the new double bonds form in the ring structure.

The starting material is an octadiene, which means it has two double bonds. For RCM to form a six-membered ring (as the target is cyclohexene), the starting material must have a diene structure where the two double bonds are positioned such that when they undergo metathesis, they form a six-membered ring.

Wait, octadiene has eight carbons. So after RCM, the ring will close to become six-membered. The remaining two carbons (since 8-6=2) would form the two alkanes released. Alternatively, perhaps each double bond in the starting material is part of a chain that will connect to form the ring.

Wait, perhaps each double bond in the starting material is separated by a certain number of carbons. The key is the number of carbons between the two double bonds. For RCM to form a six-membered ring, the starting material should have two double bonds with four single bonds between them. Because 4 single bonds plus the two alkenes (each has two carbons) give 4 + 2 + 2 = 8 carbons. Wait, no. Let me think differently.

Wait, each double bond is two carbon atoms. The number of single bonds between the two double bonds in the starting material determines the size of the ring formed. The formula for the ring size is (n) where n = (number of single bonds between the two double bonds + 1). So for a six-membered ring, the starting material should have four single bonds (n=5) between the two double bonds. Because 4 single bonds plus the two alkenes (each having two carbons) would give 4+2+2 =8 carbons, hence octadiene.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The formula I remember is that the ring size is (number of single bonds between the two alkenes) + 2 (since each alkene contributes two carbons). Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again.

In RCM, the two alkenes are connected. The number of carbons between the two alkenes (the distance) determines the ring size. For a six-membered ring, the distance between the alkenes in the starting material should be such that when the two ends connect, the ring is six carbons.

So, if the starting material has two alkenes separated by three carbons, then when they connect, the ring would have 2 (from each alkene) +3 (the carbons in between) = 5? Hmm, that's not right. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the chain length.

Another approach: The starting material is a diene (two double bonds), and during RCM, the rings form so that the double bonds in the ring come from the ends of the starting diene.

Alternatively, the starting material is a diene where the two alkenes are positioned such that when they undergo metathesis, the ring is formed, and the substituents end up in the correct positions.

Let me try to model this. Suppose we have an octadiene with two double bonds. Let's say the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2. But that's not correct because it's a straight chain. But in the starting material, the substituents are already present.

Wait, the target is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. So the substituents are at positions 3,4,5 on the cyclohexene ring.

In the starting material, these substituents should be on one of the ends of the diene. Because during RCM, the substituents from each end of the diene become adjacent in the ring.

Hmm, perhaps the two double bonds are at positions 1 and 7 in the octadiene. Because when RCM occurs, the ends would connect to form a six-membered ring.

Wait, let's think about the structure. The starting material is an octadiene, so it's C8H12.

After RCM, the ring will be six-membered, so the diene must have two double bonds separated by four single bonds, I think. Because 4 single bonds plus two double bonds (each 2 carbons) would make 4 + (2*2) =8. So, for the starting material, the two double bonds should be separated by four single bonds.

Wait, but for a six-membered ring, the number of bonds between the two alkenes in the starting material should be such that when the ends are connected, the ring is six carbons. So the formula is that the number of carbons between the two alkenes is (n-2), where n is the ring size. So for n=6, the number is 4. So the starting material has two alkenes separated by four carbons.

So in the starting material, the structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that's a straight chain. But in the options, the substituents are at specific positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an 8-carbon diene with substituents located in such a way that when the RCM occurs, those substituents end up at positions 3,4,5 on the cyclohexene.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene.

So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3))-CH2-CH2. Wait, no. Let me think.

Wait, the substituents are in positions 3,4,5. So, the starting material must have substituents in positions that, after RCM, end up as 3,4,5 on the ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has substituents on carbons that are connected to become the ring's substituents. So during RCM, the two ends of the diene (carbons 1 and 7, for example) form the new double bond in the ring.

Let's take option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

Structure: positions 1 and 6 have double bonds.

So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2. Wait, but that might not make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should number the starting material from 1 to 8.

For each option, let me imagine the structure.

Option A: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene.

So, positions 1-2: double bond (CH2=CH-), then position 3 and 4 have methyl groups: CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-, then position 5 is isopropyl: CH(CH2CH(CH3))-, and then positions 6,7: double bond (CH2-CH2-), but wait, the double bonds are at positions 1 and 7? Wait, octa-1,7-diene would have double bonds at 1-2 and 7-8.

So structure: CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2? Wait, but that's not right. Because positions 1,2 double bond, then three single bonds (3,4,5,6), and another double at positions 7 and 8.

Wait, perhaps I should visualize it.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe another approach: when RCM occurs, the two alkenes (positions 1-2 and 7-8) in the starting material will undergo metathesis. The catalyst will break each double bond, so each end is a carbene, then the ends exchange, forming new sigma bonds.

So the two alkenes are at the ends of the octadiene. So when they undergo RCM, the ends will connect. The number of carbons between the two alkenes is 8-(2+2) =4. So the number of single bonds between the two alkenes is 4. So when they form a ring, the ring will have 4+2=6 members (because each alkene contributes two carbons, and the four in between connect them).

So the ring formed will have a double bond where? Because the starting material has two double bonds, after RCM, the new ring will have a double bond. The position of this double bond depends on where the metathesis occurred.

Wait, in RCM, the catalyst breaks the double bonds, so the new double bond in the ring is formed between the two alkenes. So the two alkenes in the starting material are at positions 1 and 7 (octa-1,7-diene), so when they undergo RCM, the ring would form between carbon 1 and carbon 7.

Wait, perhaps a more concrete example. Let's imagine the starting material is octa-1,7-diene. Structure: CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 (but with substituents). When RCM occurs, the ends (the two alkenes) are connected. So the new ring would have a six-membered structure, with a double bond at position 1 (the former 1,2 double bond becomes a single bond in the ring, but wait, no.

Alternatively, the metathesis will swap the ends, so the double bonds are broken, and new bonds are formed. The new double bond in the ring is between the two former alkenes.

Wait, maybe when two alkenes undergo RCM, the new double bond is located at the point where the two alkenes were connected.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think of the product.

The target is cyclohexene with substituents. The substituents are at positions 3,4,5. So in the starting material, these substituents must be on the appropriate carbons so that upon ring closure, they end up in the right positions.

Option A: octa-1,7-diene. So the substituents are at 3,4,5. When the ends (1 and 7) are connected, the substituents at 3 and 4 would be on the ring's carbons 3 and 4 (since the starting material's positions 3 and 4 become the ring's 3 and 4), and the substituent at 5 would be at ring position 5.

Wait, perhaps that's correct. Let me imagine the starting material as:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3))-CH2-CH2.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me number the starting material as 1 to 8.

In option A, the substituents are at 3,4 (methyl) and 5 (isopropyl). The double bonds are at 1-2 and 7-8.

So the structure is:

1: CH2=CH- (pos 1-2)

3: CH2-

4: CH(CH3)-

5: CH(CH3)-

6: CH(CH2CH(CH3))- ?

Wait, maybe not. Let me try to visualize it.

Option A: positions 3 and 4 have methyl groups, position 5 has isopropyl.

So when the RCM occurs, the 1 and 7 positions (the ends) will form the ring. So the chain from 1-2 (double bond) is connected to 7-8 (another double bond). So the ring will have 6 members because 8-2=6 carbons? No, wait, the RCM forms a ring by connecting two ends, so the number of carbons in the ring is the number of carbons between the two double bonds plus one from each double bond.

Wait, in the starting material, the two double bonds are at 1-2 and 7-8. The number of carbons between them is 7-2 =5, which is 5 (C3, C4, C5, C6, C7). Wait, no, because from 2 to 7 is 5 carbons (3,4,5,6,7). So the ring formed would have 5 + 2 (from the two double bonds) =7? That doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should count the number of carbons between the two alkenes. If the two alkenes are at positions 1-2 and 6-7, then the number of carbons between them is 4 (positions 3,4,5,6). So when they undergo RCM, the ring would be 4 (in between) + 2 (from each alkene) =6, which is correct.

Hmm, perhaps that's the case. So the starting material should have double bonds at 1-2 and 6-7.

Wait, let me check the options. Looking back at the options:

Option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

So the double bonds are at positions 1-2 and 6-7.

So the structure would be:

1-2: CH2=CH-

3: CH2-

4: CH(CH3)-

5: CH(CH3)-

6: CH2-

7-8: CH2-CH2.

Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, octa-1,6-diene would have double bonds at positions 1-2 and 6-7.

So the structure would be:

1: CH2=CH-

2: -CH-

3: -CH-

4: -CH(CH3)-

5: -CH(CH3)-

6: -CH-

7: -CH2-

8: -CH2.

Wait, no. Wait, 1-2 double bond, then single bonds from 2 to 6, then 6-7 double bond. So the substituents are at 3,4,5 with methyl and isopropyl.

So after RCM, the double bonds at 1-2 and 6-7 would form a ring. The ring would be six-membered, because the distance between the double bonds is four single bonds (from position 2 to 6: positions 3,4,5,6). Wait, positions 2 to 6 are four single bonds (since 2 is connected to 3, 3 to 4, 4 to 5, 5 to 6). So four single bonds between the two double bonds.

So when RCM occurs, the ring would have 4+2 =6 carbons, which matches the cyclohexene target.

So the substituents in the starting material are at 3,4,5. When the ring forms, these substituents would be at positions 3,4,5 of the cyclohexene ring.

Wait, but in the target, the substituents are at positions 3,4,5. So that would fit.

So, in the starting material, which is option C (octa-1,6-diene), the substituents are at 3,4,5. When the two ends (1-2 and 6-7) form the ring, the substituents remain in the same positions. So the resulting cyclohexene would have substituents at 3,4,5, which matches the target.

Wait, but the target is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. So in the starting material, the substituents would need to be at positions 3,4,5.

Looking at option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

So, in the starting material, positions 3 and 4 are methyl groups (3,4-dimethyl), and position 5 is isopropyl.

When RCM occurs, the two double bonds (1-2 and 6-7) will form a ring. So the starting material after RCM would have a cyclohexene ring with substituents at 3,4,5.

Wait, but in the cyclohexene, position 1 is where the double bond is. Wait, no—the target has a double bond at position 1. So in the starting material, the 1-2 double bond would form a bond in the ring, and the 6-7 double bond would form another bond. But in RCM, the new double bond is formed in the ring.

Wait, perhaps I got that wrong. Let me think again: when RCM occurs, the two alkenes are connected, and the new double bond is between the two central positions.

Wait, maybe the starting material's substituents are positioned in such a way that after RCM, they end up in the correct positions on the cyclohexene.

Another approach: imagine the starting material as a straight chain with substituents.

The target is cyclohexene with substituents at 3,4,5.

So in the starting material, the substituents should be on the same side as the positions that will form the ring.

If the starting material is an octadiene, the substituents must be located such that when the ends undergo RCM, the substituents are correctly placed.

Option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

So the substituents are at 3,4,5. The double bonds are at 1 and 6.

When RCM occurs, the two ends (1 and 6) form the ring. So the substituents at 3,4,5 are in the middle of the chain, which becomes the middle of the ring.

So in the ring, substituents would be on carbons 3,4,5. That matches the target.

Wait, but in the starting material, the substituents are 3,4,5, which, when the ring is formed, would correspond to the same positions in the cyclohexene.

So if the starting material is option C, then the product would have substituents at 3,4,5 in the ring, which matches the target.

Alternatively, let me think about the positions of the substituents in the ring.

The target has substituents at 3,4,5. So in the starting material, these substituents must be in the middle of the chain. Because when the ends (1 and 6) are connected, the middle becomes positions 3,4,5 in the ring.

So the substituents in positions 3,4,5 in the starting material would end up in the same positions in the ring.

Which option has substituents in the middle positions?

Option C: substituents at 3,4,5.

So when RCM occurs, these substituents are in the middle of the chain. Thus, the ring will have substituents at 3,4,5.

Yes, that seems correct.

Another point: the target cyclohexene has a double bond at position 1. So the double bond in the starting material would be at position 1, which becomes the double bond in the ring.

Wait, in RCM, the catalyst breaks the alkenes, so the new double bond is formed in the ring. So the starting material's 1,2 double bond would become the 1,2 single bond in the ring, but that's not correct. Alternatively, the new double bond is formed between the two alkenes.

Wait, perhaps the position of the new double bond in the ring depends on where the metathesis occurs.

If the starting material has double bonds at 1 and 6, the RCM would form a ring where the new double bond is between carbons 1 and 6. So the cyclohexene would have a double bond between 1 and 2? Or between 1 and 6?

Wait, maybe I should think about the metathesis process.

In RCM, the two alkenes in the starting material undergo a [2+2] cycloaddition, which is followed by a ring-opening to form the new ring. The catalyst is a metal carbene, which inserts into the alkenes.

So, considering a starting material with two alkenes: the first at positions 1-2 (CH2=CH-) and the second at 6-7 (CH2-CH2=CH2?), no, wait, octa-1,6-diene would have double bonds between 1-2 and 6-7.

So the structure would be: CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2. But with substituents at 3,4,5.

Wait, but the substituents in the starting material are at 3,4,5.

When RCM occurs, the two alkenes (1-2 and 6-7) will form a new bond between C1 and C7, and between C2 and C6. This would form a six-membered ring.

Wait, perhaps the new double bond in the ring will be between C1 and C6, but that depends on the mechanism.

Alternatively, the new double bond in the ring is between the two alkenes. So the double bonds in the starting material are at 1-2 and 6-7. When RCM occurs, the new double bond in the ring would be between C2 and C6. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the new double bond is formed between the carbons that were adjacent to the original double bonds.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to imagine the product.

The target is cyclohexene with a double bond at position 1. So in the product, the double bond is between C1 and C2.

Thus, in the starting material, the 1-2 double bond would become the 1-2 single bond in the ring, but that doesn't make sense because the target has a double bond there.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Another approach: in RCM, the two alkenes are transformed into a new ring with a new double bond. The positions of the substituents are determined by where they were in the starting material.

In the target, the substituents are at positions 3,4,5, which are adjacent or next to each other in the ring.

So the starting material must have substituents in positions that, when the ring is formed, end up at 3,4,5.

If the starting material is an octadiene with substituents at 3,4,5 and double bonds at 1 and 6, then when the ends (1 and 6) connect to form the ring, the substituents at 3,4,5 would be on the ring's carbons 3,4,5. So that fits the target.

So option C would be the correct starting material.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the starting material needed to synthesize 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene via ring-closing metathesis (RCM), we analyze the options provided and the mechanism of RCM. RCM involves the redistribution of alkylidene groups between two alkenes, forming a ring and releasing alkanes as byproducts. The starting material must have two double bonds positioned such that, upon RCM, the substituents end up in the correct positions on the cyclohexene ring.

### Key Points:
1. **Target Molecule**: The target is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. This is a six-membered cyclohexene ring with:
   - A double bond at position 1.
   - Methyl groups at positions 3 and 4.
   - An isopropyl group at position 5.

2. **Starting Material Requirements**:
   - The starting material must be an octadiene with two double bonds.
   - The substituents (methyl and isopropyl groups) must be positioned such that, after RCM, they end up at positions 3, 4, and 5 on the cyclohexene ring.
   - The two double bonds in the starting material should be separated by four single bonds to form a six-membered ring.

3. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A (5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene)**: The double bonds are at positions 1-2 and 7-8. The substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 would not align correctly with the target molecule after RCM, as the double bonds are too far apart to form a six-membered ring.
   - **Option B (5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene)**: The double bonds are at positions 2-3 and 6-7. This arrangement would not result in the correct positioning of the substituents on the cyclohexene ring.
   - **Option C (5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene)**: The double bonds are at positions 1-2 and 6-7. The substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 are positioned such that, after RCM, they align correctly with the target molecule. This option satisfies the requirements for forming a six-membered ring with the correct substituents.
   - **Option D (4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene)**: The substituents are misplaced, and the double bonds are positioned incorrectly to form the target molecule.

### Conclusion:
The correct starting material is **5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene** (Option C), as it has the appropriate substituents and double bond positions to yield the target molecule via RCM.

Answer: C

Okay, so I've got this question about ring-closing metathesis (RCM) and I'm trying to figure it out. I'm a bit rusty on my metathesis reactions, but I'll try to think it through.

The question asks for the starting material needed to synthesize 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene via RCM. The options are A, B, C, D, each being different octadienes.

First, I remember that ring-closing metathesis involves the redistribution of alkylidene groups between two alkenes, typically catalyzed by a transition metal like ruthenium or rhodium. The process forms a ring by connecting the two alkenes, releasing two alkanes as a byproduct.

So, the general idea is that each starting diene has two double bonds. The RCM will break and reform these double bonds in such a way that a ring is formed. The positions of the substituents (like isopropyl and methyl groups) are key here.

The target molecule is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. Let me draw that structure. Cyclohexene ring with substituents: at position 1, there's a double bond (between C1 and C2). Positions 3 and 4 have methyl groups, and position 5 has an isopropyl group.

Wait, cyclohexene has six members. So numbering starts at the double bond. In cyclohexene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the substituents are on C3, C4, and C5.

In the starting material, which is an octadiene, there are two double bonds. The RCM will connect the two alkenes to form the ring.

RCM typically involves two alkenes in the diene. The catalyst will break each double bond, swap the ends, and form a new double bond in the ring. So the positions of the double bonds in the starting material will determine where the ring forms.

Let me think about the general RCM mechanism. Suppose we have two alkenes, A and B, in the starting molecule. After RCM, they form a ring, with the new double bond somewhere in the ring. The catalyst facilitates the exchange, so the ends that were previously double bonds become single bonds, and the new double bonds form in the ring structure.

The starting material is an octadiene, which means it has two double bonds. For RCM to form a six-membered ring (as the target is cyclohexene), the starting material must have a diene structure where the two double bonds are positioned such that when they undergo metathesis, they form a six-membered ring.

Wait, octadiene has eight carbons. So after RCM, the ring will close to become six-membered. The remaining two carbons (since 8-6=2) would form the two alkanes released. Alternatively, perhaps each double bond in the starting material is part of a chain that will connect to form the ring.

Wait, perhaps each double bond in the starting material is separated by a certain number of carbons. The key is the number of carbons between the two double bonds. For RCM to form a six-membered ring, the starting material should have two double bonds with four single bonds between them. Because 4 single bonds plus the two alkenes (each has two carbons) give 4 + 2 + 2 = 8 carbons. Wait, no. Let me think differently.

Wait, each double bond is two carbon atoms. The number of single bonds between the two double bonds in the starting material determines the size of the ring formed. The formula for the ring size is (n) where n = (number of single bonds between the two double bonds + 1). So for a six-membered ring, the starting material should have four single bonds (n=5) between the two double bonds. Because 4 single bonds plus the two alkenes (each having two carbons) would give 4+2+2 =8 carbons, hence octadiene.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The formula I remember is that the ring size is (number of single bonds between the two alkenes) + 2 (since each alkene contributes two carbons). Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again.

In RCM, the two alkenes are connected. The number of carbons between the two alkenes (the distance) determines the ring size. For a six-membered ring, the distance between the alkenes in the starting material should be such that when the two ends connect, the ring is six carbons.

So, if the starting material has two alkenes separated by three carbons, then when they connect, the ring would have 2 (from each alkene) +3 (the carbons in between) = 5? Hmm, that's not right. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the chain length.

Another approach: The starting material is a diene (two double bonds), and during RCM, the rings form so that the double bonds in the ring come from the ends of the starting diene.

Alternatively, the starting material is a diene where the two alkenes are positioned such that when they undergo metathesis, the ring is formed, and the substituents end up in the correct positions.

Let me try to model this. Suppose we have an octadiene with two double bonds. Let's say the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2. But that's not correct because it's a straight chain. But in the starting material, the substituents are already present.

Wait, the target is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. So the substituents are at positions 3,4,5 on the cyclohexene ring.

In the starting material, these substituents should be on one of the ends of the diene. Because during RCM, the substituents from each end of the diene become adjacent in the ring.

Hmm, perhaps the two double bonds are at positions 1 and 7 in the octadiene. Because when RCM occurs, the ends would connect to form a six-membered ring.

Wait, let's think about the structure. The starting material is an octadiene, so it's C8H12.

After RCM, the ring will be six-membered, so the diene must have two double bonds separated by four single bonds, I think. Because 4 single bonds plus two double bonds (each 2 carbons) would make 4 + (2*2) =8. So, for the starting material, the two double bonds should be separated by four single bonds.

Wait, but for a six-membered ring, the number of bonds between the two alkenes in the starting material should be such that when the ends are connected, the ring is six carbons. So the formula is that the number of carbons between the two alkenes is (n-2), where n is the ring size. So for n=6, the number is 4. So the starting material has two alkenes separated by four carbons.

So in the starting material, the structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that's a straight chain. But in the options, the substituents are at specific positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an 8-carbon diene with substituents located in such a way that when the RCM occurs, those substituents end up at positions 3,4,5 on the cyclohexene.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene.

So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3))-CH2-CH2. Wait, no. Let me think.

Wait, the substituents are in positions 3,4,5. So, the starting material must have substituents in positions that, after RCM, end up as 3,4,5 on the ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has substituents on carbons that are connected to become the ring's substituents. So during RCM, the two ends of the diene (carbons 1 and 7, for example) form the new double bond in the ring.

Let's take option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

Structure: positions 1 and 6 have double bonds.

So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2. Wait, but that might not make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should number the starting material from 1 to 8.

For each option, let me imagine the structure.

Option A: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene.

So, positions 1-2: double bond (CH2=CH-), then position 3 and 4 have methyl groups: CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-, then position 5 is isopropyl: CH(CH2CH(CH3))-, and then positions 6,7: double bond (CH2-CH2-), but wait, the double bonds are at positions 1 and 7? Wait, octa-1,7-diene would have double bonds at 1-2 and 7-8.

So structure: CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2? Wait, but that's not right. Because positions 1,2 double bond, then three single bonds (3,4,5,6), and another double at positions 7 and 8.

Wait, perhaps I should visualize it.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe another approach: when RCM occurs, the two alkenes (positions 1-2 and 7-8) in the starting material will undergo metathesis. The catalyst will break each double bond, so each end is a carbene, then the ends exchange, forming new sigma bonds.

So the two alkenes are at the ends of the octadiene. So when they undergo RCM, the ends will connect. The number of carbons between the two alkenes is 8-(2+2) =4. So the number of single bonds between the two alkenes is 4. So when they form a ring, the ring will have 4+2=6 members (because each alkene contributes two carbons, and the four in between connect them).

So the ring formed will have a double bond where? Because the starting material has two double bonds, after RCM, the new ring will have a double bond. The position of this double bond depends on where the metathesis occurred.

Wait, in RCM, the catalyst breaks the double bonds, so the new double bond in the ring is formed between the two alkenes. So the two alkenes in the starting material are at positions 1 and 7 (octa-1,7-diene), so when they undergo RCM, the ring would form between carbon 1 and carbon 7.

Wait, perhaps a more concrete example. Let's imagine the starting material is octa-1,7-diene. Structure: CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 (but with substituents). When RCM occurs, the ends (the two alkenes) are connected. So the new ring would have a six-membered structure, with a double bond at position 1 (the former 1,2 double bond becomes a single bond in the ring, but wait, no.

Alternatively, the metathesis will swap the ends, so the double bonds are broken, and new bonds are formed. The new double bond in the ring is between the two former alkenes.

Wait, maybe when two alkenes undergo RCM, the new double bond is located at the point where the two alkenes were connected.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think of the product.

The target is cyclohexene with substituents. The substituents are at positions 3,4,5. So in the starting material, these substituents must be on the appropriate carbons so that upon ring closure, they end up in the right positions.

Option A: octa-1,7-diene. So the substituents are at 3,4,5. When the ends (1 and 7) are connected, the substituents at 3 and 4 would be on the ring's carbons 3 and 4 (since the starting material's positions 3 and 4 become the ring's 3 and 4), and the substituent at 5 would be at ring position 5.

Wait, perhaps that's correct. Let me imagine the starting material as:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3))-CH2-CH2.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me number the starting material as 1 to 8.

In option A, the substituents are at 3,4 (methyl) and 5 (isopropyl). The double bonds are at 1-2 and 7-8.

So the structure is:

1: CH2=CH- (pos 1-2)

3: CH2-

4: CH(CH3)-

5: CH(CH3)-

6: CH(CH2CH(CH3))- ?

Wait, maybe not. Let me try to visualize it.

Option A: positions 3 and 4 have methyl groups, position 5 has isopropyl.

So when the RCM occurs, the 1 and 7 positions (the ends) will form the ring. So the chain from 1-2 (double bond) is connected to 7-8 (another double bond). So the ring will have 6 members because 8-2=6 carbons? No, wait, the RCM forms a ring by connecting two ends, so the number of carbons in the ring is the number of carbons between the two double bonds plus one from each double bond.

Wait, in the starting material, the two double bonds are at 1-2 and 7-8. The number of carbons between them is 7-2 =5, which is 5 (C3, C4, C5, C6, C7). Wait, no, because from 2 to 7 is 5 carbons (3,4,5,6,7). So the ring formed would have 5 + 2 (from the two double bonds) =7? That doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should count the number of carbons between the two alkenes. If the two alkenes are at positions 1-2 and 6-7, then the number of carbons between them is 4 (positions 3,4,5,6). So when they undergo RCM, the ring would be 4 (in between) + 2 (from each alkene) =6, which is correct.

Hmm, perhaps that's the case. So the starting material should have double bonds at 1-2 and 6-7.

Wait, let me check the options. Looking back at the options:

Option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

So the double bonds are at positions 1-2 and 6-7.

So the structure would be:

1-2: CH2=CH-

3: CH2-

4: CH(CH3)-

5: CH(CH3)-

6: CH2-

7-8: CH2-CH2.

Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, octa-1,6-diene would have double bonds at positions 1-2 and 6-7.

So the structure would be:

1: CH2=CH-

2: -CH-

3: -CH-

4: -CH(CH3)-

5: -CH(CH3)-

6: -CH-

7: -CH2-

8: -CH2.

Wait, no. Wait, 1-2 double bond, then single bonds from 2 to 6, then 6-7 double bond. So the substituents are at 3,4,5 with methyl and isopropyl.

So after RCM, the double bonds at 1-2 and 6-7 would form a ring. The ring would be six-membered, because the distance between the double bonds is four single bonds (from position 2 to 6: positions 3,4,5,6). Wait, positions 2 to 6 are four single bonds (since 2 is connected to 3, 3 to 4, 4 to 5, 5 to 6). So four single bonds between the two double bonds.

So when RCM occurs, the ring would have 4+2 =6 carbons, which matches the cyclohexene target.

So the substituents in the starting material are at 3,4,5. When the ring forms, these substituents would be at positions 3,4,5 of the cyclohexene ring.

Wait, but in the target, the substituents are at positions 3,4,5. So that would fit.

So, in the starting material, which is option C (octa-1,6-diene), the substituents are at 3,4,5. When the two ends (1-2 and 6-7) form the ring, the substituents remain in the same positions. So the resulting cyclohexene would have substituents at 3,4,5, which matches the target.

Wait, but the target is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. So in the starting material, the substituents would need to be at positions 3,4,5.

Looking at option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

So, in the starting material, positions 3 and 4 are methyl groups (3,4-dimethyl), and position 5 is isopropyl.

When RCM occurs, the two double bonds (1-2 and 6-7) will form a ring. So the starting material after RCM would have a cyclohexene ring with substituents at 3,4,5.

Wait, but in the cyclohexene, position 1 is where the double bond is. Wait, no—the target has a double bond at position 1. So in the starting material, the 1-2 double bond would form a bond in the ring, and the 6-7 double bond would form another bond. But in RCM, the new double bond is formed in the ring.

Wait, perhaps I got that wrong. Let me think again: when RCM occurs, the two alkenes are connected, and the new double bond is between the two central positions.

Wait, maybe the starting material's substituents are positioned in such a way that after RCM, they end up in the correct positions on the cyclohexene.

Another approach: imagine the starting material as a straight chain with substituents.

The target is cyclohexene with substituents at 3,4,5.

So in the starting material, the substituents should be on the same side as the positions that will form the ring.

If the starting material is an octadiene, the substituents must be located such that when the ends undergo RCM, the substituents are correctly placed.

Option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

So the substituents are at 3,4,5. The double bonds are at 1 and 6.

When RCM occurs, the two ends (1 and 6) form the ring. So the substituents at 3,4,5 are in the middle of the chain, which becomes the middle of the ring.

So in the ring, substituents would be on carbons 3,4,5. That matches the target.

Wait, but in the starting material, the substituents are 3,4,5, which, when the ring is formed, would correspond to the same positions in the cyclohexene.

So if the starting material is option C, then the product would have substituents at 3,4,5 in the ring, which matches the target.

Alternatively, let me think about the positions of the substituents in the ring.

The target has substituents at 3,4,5. So in the starting material, these substituents must be in the middle of the chain. Because when the ends (1 and 6) are connected, the middle becomes positions 3,4,5 in the ring.

So the substituents in positions 3,4,5 in the starting material would end up in the same positions in the ring.

Which option has substituents in the middle positions?

Option C: substituents at 3,4,5.

So when RCM occurs, these substituents are in the middle of the chain. Thus, the ring will have substituents at 3,4,5.

Yes, that seems correct.

Another point: the target cyclohexene has a double bond at position 1. So the double bond in the starting material would be at position 1, which becomes the double bond in the ring.

Wait, in RCM, the catalyst breaks the alkenes, so the new double bond is formed in the ring. So the starting material's 1,2 double bond would become the 1,2 single bond in the ring, but that's not correct. Alternatively, the new double bond is formed between the two alkenes.

Wait, perhaps the position of the new double bond in the ring depends on where the metathesis occurs.

If the starting material has double bonds at 1 and 6, the RCM would form a ring where the new double bond is between carbons 1 and 6. So the cyclohexene would have a double bond between 1 and 2? Or between 1 and 6?

Wait, maybe I should think about the metathesis process.

In RCM, the two alkenes in the starting material undergo a [2+2] cycloaddition, which is followed by a ring-opening to form the new ring. The catalyst is a metal carbene, which inserts into the alkenes.

So, considering a starting material with two alkenes: the first at positions 1-2 (CH2=CH-) and the second at 6-7 (CH2-CH2=CH2?), no, wait, octa-1,6-diene would have double bonds between 1-2 and 6-7.

So the structure would be: CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2. But with substituents at 3,4,5.

Wait, but the substituents in the starting material are at 3,4,5.

When RCM occurs, the two alkenes (1-2 and 6-7) will form a new bond between C1 and C7, and between C2 and C6. This would form a six-membered ring.

Wait, perhaps the new double bond in the ring will be between C1 and C6, but that depends on the mechanism.

Alternatively, the new double bond in the ring is between the two alkenes. So the double bonds in the starting material are at 1-2 and 6-7. When RCM occurs, the new double bond in the ring would be between C2 and C6. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the new double bond is formed between the carbons that were adjacent to the original double bonds.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to imagine the product.

The target is cyclohexene with a double bond at position 1. So in the product, the double bond is between C1 and C2.

Thus, in the starting material, the 1-2 double bond would become the 1-2 single bond in the ring, but that doesn't make sense because the target has a double bond there.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Another approach: in RCM, the two alkenes are transformed into a new ring with a new double bond. The positions of the substituents are determined by where they were in the starting material.

In the target, the substituents are at positions 3,4,5, which are adjacent or next to each other in the ring.

So the starting material must have substituents in positions that, when the ring is formed, end up at 3,4,5.

If the starting material is an octadiene with substituents at 3,4,5 and double bonds at 1 and 6, then when the ends (1 and 6) connect to form the ring, the substituents at 3,4,5 would be on the ring's carbons 3,4,5. So that fits the target.

So option C would be the correct starting material.


To determine the starting material needed to synthesize 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene via ring-closing metathesis (RCM), we analyze the options provided and the mechanism of RCM. RCM involves the redistribution of alkylidene groups between two alkenes, forming a ring and releasing alkanes as byproducts. The starting material must have two double bonds positioned such that, upon RCM, the substituents end up in the correct positions on the cyclohexene ring.

### Key Points:
1. **Target Molecule**: The target is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. This is a six-membered cyclohexene ring with:
   - A double bond at position 1.
   - Methyl groups at positions 3 and 4.
   - An isopropyl group at position 5.

2. **Starting Material Requirements**:
   - The starting material must be an octadiene with two double bonds.
   - The substituents (methyl and isopropyl groups) must be positioned such that, after RCM, they end up at positions 3, 4, and 5 on the cyclohexene ring.
   - The two double bonds in the starting material should be separated by four single bonds to form a six-membered ring.

3. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A (5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene)**: The double bonds are at positions 1-2 and 7-8. The substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 would not align correctly with the target molecule after RCM, as the double bonds are too far apart to form a six-membered ring.
   - **Option B (5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene)**: The double bonds are at positions 2-3 and 6-7. This arrangement would not result in the correct positioning of the substituents on the cyclohexene ring.
   - **Option C (5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene)**: The double bonds are at positions 1-2 and 6-7. The substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 are positioned such that, after RCM, they align correctly with the target molecule. This option satisfies the requirements for forming a six-membered ring with the correct substituents.
   - **Option D (4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene)**: The substituents are misplaced, and the double bonds are positioned incorrectly to form the target molecule.

### Conclusion:
The correct starting material is **5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene** (Option C), as it has the appropriate substituents and double bond positions to yield the target molecule via RCM.
