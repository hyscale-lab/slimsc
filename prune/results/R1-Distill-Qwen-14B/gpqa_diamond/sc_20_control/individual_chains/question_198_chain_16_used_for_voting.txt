Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem about cobalt complexes and their stability constants. Hmm, I remember that stability constants (β) tell us about the tendency of a complex to form. The higher the β, the more stable the complex is.

The question is asking about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. So, the blue complex is probably the one with two SCN- ligands, maybe Co(SCN)_2^2+.

Wait, let me think. The problem gives β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. So, β1 is for Co(SCN), β2 for Co(SCN)₂, β3 for Co(SCN)₃, and β4 for Co(SCN)₄? Or wait, sometimes the numbering could be different. Oh wait, no, the nomenclature usually goes by the number of ligands. So βn is the stability constant for the complex with n SCN- ligands. So, β1 is the first complex, β2 the second, etc.

The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. So, I need to find the fraction of Co(SCN)_2^2+ in the solution.

I think I should use the formation of complexes step by step. The distribution of the cobalt species depends on the stability constants and the concentrations of the ions.

So, the general approach would be to calculate the fraction of each complex (from n=0 to n=4, where n is the number of SCN- attached) and then find the percentage for n=2.

But wait, the problem says "dithiocyanato," which means two SCN ligands. So, that's the Co(SCN)_2²+ complex. So, we're looking for the fraction of this species.

The formula for each species is based on the stepwise formation constants. Alternatively, using the overall stability constants. Wait, but the given βs are stability constants, so for each complex, βn is the equilibrium constant for the formation of [Co(SCN)_n]^2+ from [Co(SCN)_{n-1}]^2+ and SCN^-.

Wait, no. Actually, the overall stability constant K for [Co(SCN)_n]^charge is the product of the stepwise βs up to n. For example, β_total for n=2 would be β1 * β2.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. The stability constant for the formation of the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^{2+} is given as βn. So, for each n, βn is the equilibrium constant for:

Co^{2+} + n SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_n]^{2+}

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, stability constants are cumulative. Let me think again. For example, the first complex is [Co(SCN)]^2+, which has β1=9. The second complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, which has β2=40. But wait, β2 is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the second complex from the first one and another SCN-.

So, the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} would be β1 * β2. Because the formation involves two steps: first adding one SCN- (with K=β1), then another (K=β2) for the second.

Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of the general approach. The fraction of each species can be found by considering the cumulative product of the stability constants and the concentrations.

The general formula for the fraction f_n of the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^{2+} is:

f_n = (K_n * [Co^{2+}] ) / ( 1 + K_1 [SCN^-] + K_1 K_2 [SCN^-]^2 + ... + K_1 K_2 ... K_n [SCN^-]^n )

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, the fractions are calculated using the cumulative product of the βs. So, for each n, the fraction f_n is:

f_n = (β_1 β_2 ... β_n [Co] [SCN]^n ) / ( sum_{m=0}^4 (β_1 β_2 ... β_m [SCN]^m) ) )

Wait, but wait, the initial Co is Co^2+ which then binds SCN^- to form complexes. So, the total concentration of Co is the sum of all species: [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + [Co(SCN)_3]^{-} + [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}.

Oh, but looking at the question, the problem states that the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M. So, the sum of all the species' concentrations equals 0.01 M.

But perhaps it's easier to model this using the formation constants and the concentration of SCN-.

Wait, another approach: the fraction of each complex is determined by the relative stability of each complex and the concentration of the ligand.

The fraction f_n is given by:

f_n = (β_1 β_2 ... β_n [Co^{2+}] [SCN^-]^n ) / (sum_{k=0}^4 (product_{i=1}^k β_i [SCN^-]^i) ) )

But wait, for each n, the numerator is the product of β1 to βn times [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.

Wait, but [Co^2+] is the concentration of the free ion, which is part of the solution. Hmm, perhaps it's better to think that the total cobalt is the sum of all species.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this using the distribution of the complexes based on the ligand concentration and the stability constants.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Write down the expressions for each species in terms of [Co^2+] and [SCN^-].

2. The total concentration of Co is the sum of all species, including the free Co^2+.

3. However, because the problem gives the total cobalt concentration as 0.01 M, I can consider that the sum of all species equals this.

But perhaps a more manageable approach is to express each species in terms of the free Co^2+ and the ligand concentration.

Let me denote:

[Co]_total = [Co^2+] + [CoSCN+] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3]^- + [Co(SCN)4]^2- = 0.01 M

The concentrations of the complexes can be expressed in terms of [Co^2+] and [SCN^-].

Each complex [Co(SCN)_n]^{2+ * (1 -n)} has a formation constant K_n = β_1 β_2 ... β_n.

So, for each complex, [Co(SCN)_n] = K_n [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n

Wait, no. Because K_n is the overall stability constant. So for each n, [Co(SCN)_n] = K_n [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n / [product terms?]

Wait, let me think about it again. The overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n] is K_n = β_1 * β_2 * ... * β_n.

The formation of each complex from the previous one:

[Co^{2+}] + SCN^- ⇌ [CoSCN]^+ ; K1=β1=9

[CoSCN]^+ + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_2]^0 ; K2=β2=40

So, for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, K_total = K1 * K2 = 9 *40= 360.

Similarly, [Co(SCN)_3]^- has K3 = K1 K2 K3 = 9*40*63= 22680.

And [Co(SCN)_4]^2- has K4= K1*K2*K3*K4= 9*40*63*16= 380160, but wait, wait that's not correct. Because the given β4 is 16. Wait, but β4 is for the fourth step. So, for [Co(SCN)_4]^2-, the K would be β1β2β3β4=9*40*63*16= 362880.

Wait, but wait, the way the problem presents β1 to β4: perhaps each β represents the stepwise formation constant. So, β1 is the formation of [CoSCN]^+ from Co^2+ and SCN^-, β2 is the formation of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 from [CoSCN]^+ and SCN^-, etc.

Yes, that's correct. So the overall K for each complex is the product of the βs up to that point.

So, for each n, the overall K_n = product from i=1 to n of βi.

So, for n=1: K1=9.

n=2: K2=9*40=360.

n=3: K3=9*40*63= 22680.

n=4: K4=9*40*63*16= 362880.

Wait, wait, 9*40 is 360. 360 *63= 22680. 22680 *16= 362880.

So, with these K's, we can calculate the fraction of each complex.

The fraction f_n is given by:

f_n = (K_n [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n) / (sum_{m=0}^4 K_m [SCN^-]^m )

Wait, but wait, [Co(SCN)_n] = K_n [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n / (1 + sum terms for each K_m [SCN^-]^m up to m=n)

Wait, no. Let me think of the general expression. The fraction of each complex is:

f_n = (K_n [SCN^-]^n ) / ( sum_{k=0}^4 K_k [SCN^-]^k )

Because [Co^2+] is the same in each term, it cancels out.

Wait, but wait, the denominator is the sum of all possible complexes, including the free Co^2+ (which is K_0=1, as the zeroth term).

So, yes, f_n = (K_n [SCN^-]^n) / ( sum_{k=0}^4 K_k [SCN^-]^k )

But wait, no. Because the free Co^2+ is K_0 [Co^2+], and each complex [Co(SCN)_n] is K_n [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n.

So, the total concentration would be [Co]_total = [Co^2+] ( 1 + sum_{n=1}^4 K_n [SCN^-]^n )

So, [Co^2+] = [Co]_total / (1 + sum_{n=1}^4 K_n [SCN^-]^n )

But for the purpose of finding the fractions f_n, which is the concentration of each complex relative to the total, we can write:

f_n = (K_n [SCN^-]^n ) / ( sum_{k=0}^4 K_k [SCN^-]^k )

Wait, because the total is [Co]_total = [Co^2+] * (1 + K1 [SCN^-] + K2 [SCN^-]^2 + K3 [SCN^-]^3 + K4 [SCN^-]^4 )

So, [Co^2+] = [Co]_total / (1 + K1 [SCN^-] + K2 [SCN^-]^2 + K3 [SCN^-]^3 + K4 [SCN^-]^4 )

But when calculating the fraction of a particular complex, say [Co(SCN)_2], it's [Co(SCN)_2] = K2 [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^2.

So, substituting [Co^2+] from earlier:

[Co(SCN)_2] = K2 [Co]_total [SCN^-]^2 / (1 + K1 [SCN^-] + K2 [SCN^-]^2 + K3 [SCN^-]^3 + K4 [SCN^-]^4 )

So, the fraction f_2 is:

f_2 = [Co(SCN)_2] / [Co]_total = ( K2 [SCN^-]^2 ) / (1 + K1 [SCN^-] + K2 [SCN^-]^2 + K3 [SCN^-]^3 + K4 [SCN^-]^4 )

So, substituting the given numbers:

K1 = 9

K2 = 9 *40 = 360

K3 = 9*40*63=22680

K4=9*40*63*16=362880

But wait, the [SCN^-] is given as 0.1 M. Let's compute each term in the denominator.

Compute each term:

Term for n=0: 1

n=1: K1 [SCN]^1 =9 *0.1=0.9

n=2: K2 [SCN]^2 =360*(0.1)^2=360*0.01=3.6

n=3: K3 [SCN]^3=22680*(0.1)^3=22680*0.001=22.68

n=4: K4 [SCN]^4=362880*(0.1)^4=362880*0.0001=36.288

So, each term is:

n=0: 1

n=1: 0.9

n=2:3.6

n=3:22.68

n=4:36.288

Now, sum all these up:

1 + 0.9 = 1.9

+3.6 → 5.5

+22.68 → 28.18

+36.288 → 64.468

So, denominator =64.468.

The numerator for f_2 is K2 [SCN]^2 =3.6.

So, f2=3.6 /64.468 ≈ 0.0555555556.

Wait, 3.6 divided by 64.468.

Calculating:

3.6 / 64.468 ≈ 0.05555.

Wait, that's about 5.555% which is 5.555%. But none of the options are close to that. Wait, the options are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%.

Wait, that suggests I made a mistake somewhere. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the terms. Let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, let me compute each term again.

K1=9, [SCN]=0.1 → 9 * 0.1 =0.9.

K2=360, [SCN]^2=0.01 → 360 * 0.01 =3.6.

K3=22680, [SCN]^3=0.001 → 22680 *0.001=22.68.

K4=362880, [SCN]^4=0.0001 → 362880 *0.0001=36.288.

So the terms are correct.

Adding them up:

1 +0.9=1.9

+3.6→5.5

+22.68→28.18

+36.288→64.468.

Denominator is 64.468.

So, f2=3.6 /64.468 ≈ 0.05555, which is approximately 5.555%. But that's not matching any option.

Wait, that can't be right because the options are all higher. So, I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I confused the order of the stability constants. Let me check: the question says the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, β4 is 16. So, K4=β1 *β2 *β3 *β4=9*40*63*16=9*40=360, 360 *63=22680, 22680*16=362880? Wait, wait 22680 *16.

Wait: 22680 *10=226800,

22680 *6=136080.

So 226800 +136080 = 362880. That's correct.

Wait, but then why am I getting such a low fraction for the [Co(SCN)_2] complex? Because according to the calculation, the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- has a huge stability constant, so it's the dominant species. But that's not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the second complex, but my calculation is correct, but the options don't have that. So maybe I made a wrong assumption about the complexes.

Wait, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. I thought that was [Co(SCN)_2]^0. But perhaps I'm wrong about the complex that's blue.

Wait, maybe it's another complex. Let me think: I remember that the different complexes of Co(II) have different colors. For example, [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is blue, I think. Or maybe [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is blue. I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the common colors. I think [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is blue, and [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is green. Alternatively, maybe [Co(SCN)_3]^− is blue. But I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex as blue. Hmm. But according to the calculation, it's about 5.5% which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the stability constants are given as sequential βs, so each β is the stepwise addition of one SCN- to form the next complex. So, perhaps the overall K for each complex is the product of the βs up to that point.

Wait, but in that case, the calculation is correct. So perhaps the mistake is elsewhere.

Wait, maybe the question refers to the first complex as [Co(SCN)]^+ (monosulfocyanide), the second as [Co(SCN)_2]^0, etc. So, the given βs are for each step, and their product gives the overall K for each complex.

So, perhaps the problem is that the denominator is including [Co^2+] as a separate term, which is correct. But in my calculation, the denominator is 64.468, which is sum of all terms. But let me think again about the fractions.

Wait, perhaps the total is [Co^2+] (1 + K1[SCN] + K2[SCN]^2 + K3[SCN]^3 + K4[SCN]^4 ) =0.01 M.

But the fraction f2 is [Co(SCN)_2]/(sum of all), which is (K2 [SCN]^2 )/(sum of all K terms).

So, perhaps the denominator should include all K terms, including K0=1.

Wait, but that's what I did. So, the calculation seems correct.

Hmm, but the result I'm getting is about 5.5%, which isn't among the options. That suggests that perhaps I've made a wrong assumption.

Wait, maybe the problem isn't using the overall K, but just the β as the formation constant for each complex. For example, perhaps the total fraction is calculated using each β as the formation from the free ion, not considering the stepwise addition.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and forgot to include some terms.

Wait, perhaps the denominator should have each term as [Co^2+] multiplied by the K for each complex, which would mean that each [Co(SCN)_n] is K_n [Co^2+][SCN]^n. So, the sum is [Co^2+] (1 + K1[SCN] + K2[SCN]^2 + K3[SCN]^3 + K4[SCN]^4 ) ) = 0.01 M.

So, the fraction f2 is [Co(SCN)_2]/[Co]_total = (K2 [SCN]^2 [Co^2+]) / ([Co^2+] (1 + K1 [SCN] + K2 [SCN]^2 + K3[SCN]^3 + K4[SCN]^4 )) )

Which simplifies to (K2 [SCN]^2 ) / (1 + K1 [SCN] + K2 [SCN]^2 + K3[SCN]^3 + K4[SCN]^4 )

Which is what I did earlier.

So, the fractions are:

n=0: 1/64.468 ≈ 0.0155 → 1.55%

n=1: 0.9 /64.468≈0.014 →1.4%

n=2:3.6/64.468≈5.55%

n=3:22.68/64.468≈35.18%

n=4:36.288/64.468≈56.28%

So, the major species is n=4, at ~56.28%, n=3 at ~35.18%, n=2 at 5.55%, which is not matching any of the options.

But the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex, which in my calculation is 5.55%, but that's not an option. So, perhaps I made a wrong assumption about which complex is blue.

Alternatively, perhaps the β4 is for the fourth step, which would be the [Co(SCN)_4]^2− complex, which would have the highest K and thus be the major species.

But according to the problem statement, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato (two SCN) complex. So, perhaps the correct approach is to find the fraction for n=2.

But given that the options don't include 5.5%, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the terms.

Wait, let me compute each term again:

K1=9, [SCN]=0.1 → 9 *0.1=0.9.

K2=360, [SCN]^2=0.01 →360 *0.01=3.6.

K3=22680, [SCN]^3=0.001 →22680 *0.001=22.68.

K4=362880, [SCN]^4=0.0001 →362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Adding all together: 1 +0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.

Yes, that seems correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the stability constants are given for the complexes in a different order. Perhaps β1 corresponds to the [Co(SCN)_4]^2− complex, and the others are lower, but that would complicate the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I got the order of the βs wrong. Let me think again. The problem says the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, β4 is 16, which is lower than β3 and β2. That suggests that the fourth complex is less stable than the third.

But according to K4=362880, which is higher than all others. Hmm, that seems correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the fraction for the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex, which is n=2. But the calculation gives about 5.55%, which isn't an option.

Hmm. Another possibility: perhaps the problem is using the stepwise βs, but the formation of each complex is considered as a single step, not cumulative. So, for example, the overall K for [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is just β2=40. That would change the calculation.

Wait, but that can't be right because you have to form the first complex before the second. So the overall K for [Co(SCN)_2] would be β1 * β2=9*40=360, which is what I used earlier.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the stability constants are given as the overall constants, not the stepwise. Wait, but the question says 'stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, etc.' So, perhaps each β is the overall constant for that complex.

Wait, that would change the approach. Let me think again.

If β1 is the overall stability constant for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, etc., then each K is given as βn.

In that case, the fractions would be:

f_n = (βn [SCN]^n ) / (sum_{k=0}^4 βk [SCN]^k )

Because each βk is the overall K for [Co(SCN)_k]^{2+}.

But in that case:

Denominator terms would be:

n=0:1

n=1: β1 [SCN] =9 *0.1=0.9

n=2:β2 [SCN]^2=40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4

n=3:β3[SCN]^3=63*(0.001)=0.063

n=4:β4[SCN]^4=16*(0.0001)=0.0016

Wait, this makes the denominator =1 +0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016 = 2.3646

The numerator for n=2 is 0.4.

So, f2=0.4 /2.3646 ≈0.169 →16.9%.

Ah, that's one of the options, option D:16.9%.

But wait, why would the βs be the overall constants and not the stepwise ones? Because the problem states that β are the stability constants of the complexes, which usually refers to the overall constants.

Wait, but in the stepwise formation, βn is the stepwise constant for forming the nth complex from the (n-1)th.

So, that would mean that the overall K for [Co(SCN)_n] is product of β1 to βn.

But the problem says β1=9, β2=40, etc., which are the individual stepwise constants.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the overall K as βn. So, β1 is the overall for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, etc. I think this is a common point of confusion.

Wait, but the question says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16."

So, each βn is the overall K for the nth complex.

In that case, the fractions are calculated using each βn as the overall K.

So, for each n, the fraction f_n is (βn [SCN]^n) / sum_{k=0}^4 (βk [SCN]^k )

So, let me compute this.

Compute each term in denominator:

n=0:1

n=1: β1 [SCN]^1=9 *0.1=0.9

n=2:β2 [SCN]^2=40 *0.01=0.4

n=3:β3 [SCN]^3=63 *0.001=0.063

n=4:β4 [SCN]^4=16 *0.0001=0.0016

So, denominator=1 +0.9=1.9; +0.4=2.3; +0.063=2.363; +0.0016=2.3646.

Numerator for n=2:0.4.

f2=0.4/2.3646 ≈ 0.169 →16.9%, which is option D.

But earlier, when considering the stepwise βs and using the product for each K_n, the fraction was around 5.5%, which is not an option.

So, which approach is correct?

I think this depends on the definition of the stability constant given. If each βn is the overall K for the nth complex, then the calculation gives 16.9% which is option D.

But if βn are the stepwise constants, then the calculation gives 5.5%, which isn't an option. So, perhaps the problem considers each βn as the overall K.

Wait, but in the literature, the stability constant (β) for a complex is typically the overall constant, not the stepwise. But sometimes, especially in problems, the stepwise constants are given, and you have to multiply them for the overall K.

But looking at the β values: β1=9, β2=40. If they're stepwise, then the overall K for [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is 9*40=360. But if they're overall, then K is 40.

So, perhaps the problem is using the overall K, which would give the correct answer as option D.

But I'm a bit confused because the way the problem is phrased, the βs are given for each complex, which suggests they are the overall Ks.

Therefore, the correct approach is to use each βn as the overall K for the nth complex. So, the calculation gives f2=16.9%, which is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)₂]⁰) among all cobalt-containing species, we use the given stability constants (β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, β₄ = 16) and the ligand concentration [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M. The total cobalt concentration is 10⁻² M.

### Key Assumptions and Approach:
1. **Stability Constants**: The problem specifies that the stability constants (β) are for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes. These are interpreted as the **overall stability constants** for each complex, not the stepwise constants. Thus, β₁, β₂, β₃, and β₄ directly correspond to the stability constants of [CoSCN]⁺, [Co(SCN)₂]⁰, [Co(SCN)₃]⁻, and [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻, respectively.

2. **Fraction of Each Complex**: The fraction of each cobalt species is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}]^n}{\sum_{k=0}^4 \beta_k [\text{SCN}]^k}
   \]
   where \( f_n \) is the fraction of the nth complex, and the denominator accounts for all possible cobalt species.

3. **Terms in the Denominator**: Each term in the denominator is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Term}_k = \beta_k [\text{SCN}]^k
   \]
   For \( [\text{SCN}] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \):
   - \( k = 0 \): 1
   - \( k = 1 \): \( \beta_1 [\text{SCN}] = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9 \)
   - \( k = 2 \): \( \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4 \)
   - \( k = 3 \): \( \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.063 \)
   - \( k = 4 \): \( \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.0016 \)

   Summing these terms gives:
   \[
   \text{Denominator} = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
   \]

4. **Fraction of [Co(SCN)₂]⁰**: The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex is:
   \[
   f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2}{\text{Denominator}} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
   \]

5. **Percentage**: Converting the fraction to a percentage:
   \[
   f_2 \times 100 = 16.9\%
