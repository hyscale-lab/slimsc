Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, let me unpack that structure.

So the benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. The numbering is such that the tert-butyl is on position 2, ethoxy on 1, and nitro on 3. Wait, no, wait—actually, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. Let me imagine the benzene ring. Positions 1, 2, 3 are adjacent in a row. So position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro.

Wait, let's clarify: the compound is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the substituents are at carbons 1, 2, and 3. So the numbering goes like this: ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. So it's a meta arrangement? No, actually, since positions 1, 2, 3 are adjacent, it's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene, so a vicinal arrangement but in a row.

Wait, perhaps it's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. So the substituents are in a line. Now, the question is to find the correct sequence of reactions from the given options (A to D) that would lead to this compound.

So let's think about the steps needed to get these substituents onto benzene in the correct positions.

First, let's consider the substituents:

- tert-butyl: a bulky alkyl group. To introduce this, we can use Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation is tricky because it can lead to carbocation rearrangements, especially with t-butyl. Wait, but t-butyl chloride can be used with AlCl3 as a catalyst for Friedel-Crafts. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to introduce substituents via electrophilic substitution in a way that directs the incoming groups appropriately.

The ethoxy group: that's an OEt group. To introduce an ethoxy group, you can perform an etherification, like using Williamson synthesis, but more likely, in aromatic substitution, you'd probably do a nucleophilic substitution, but wait, benzene is generally not directly nucleophilic. Alternatively, you can introduce the ethoxy group via a substitution after activating the ring, perhaps through nitration or sulfonation.

Wait, more accurately, to introduce an ethoxy group on benzene, you can use the ethyl halide in the presence of a strong base, but that's not directly applicable. Alternatively, perhaps you can use a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires the ring to be activated towards nucleophilic attack, which is usually done by strong electron-withdrawing groups.

Wait, but benzene undergoes electrophilic substitution. To get an ethoxy group, perhaps we can first introduce a nitro group, which is a strong meta-directing group, then perform a substitution or some other reaction to replace it with an ethoxy group. Or maybe use a different approach. Another way is to perform a Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by something else, but that might not give an ethoxy group.

Wait, maybe I should think about the order of introducing substituents. The substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. So, to get three substituents in such close proximity, perhaps we can use a directing strategy. The first substituent will direct the second, and the second will direct the third, depending on their nature.

So, let's think about the substituents in order:

Let's think about what substituent is introduced first, second, third.

The target molecule has a nitro group (NO2), a tert-butyl (t-Bu), and an ethoxy (OEt) group.

Nitro is a strong meta-directing, deactivating group. t-Bu is a strong activating, ortho/para-directing group. Ethoxy is an activating, ortho/para-directing group.

Wait, no. Wait, ethoxy is an activating group because it's an O-alkyl group. Wait, no, wait: wait, ethoxy is an electron-donating group via resonance, so it's activating and ortho/para-directing. Similarly, t-Bu is an alkyl group, which is activating (electron-donating via induction) and ortho/para-directing.

Nitro is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group.

So, the order of introduction of substituents would influence where the others go.

Now, the problem is that we have three substituents, so we need to plan their order.

Let me think about the possible orderings.

One approach is to introduce the substituents in the order of their directing effects so that each new group is added in the correct position relative to the existing groups.

So, perhaps the first substituent is the one that directs the next substituent into the correct position.

Let me imagine that the ethoxy group is introduced first, then the t-Bu, then the nitro. Or some other order.

Wait, but let's think about the target structure.

The target is 2-(t-Bu)-1-OEt-3-NO2.

So, the substituents are at positions 1 (OEt), 2 (t-Bu), and 3 (NO2).

So, the positions are adjacent in a row. So, the OEt is at position 1, t-Bu at 2, NO2 at 3.

Wait, but let's think about the directing effects.

If we have a ring with OEt (activating, o/p-directing) and t-Bu (activating, o/p) already, when we introduce the nitro group (deactivating, meta), where would it go?

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced first, then the OEt and t-Bu.

Wait, if we introduce the nitro group first, it would be meta to where the next substituent goes. Let's think.

Wait, perhaps let's outline the possible steps.

Option 1: Introduce nitro first. Then, introduce t-Bu and OEt in the correct positions.

Option 2: Introduce OEt and t-Bu in a way that allows the nitro to be added correctly.

Wait, let's think about option 1.

First, nitration of benzene. That would introduce a nitro group at the para position, but wait, benzene would have a single nitro group after first nitration. Then, the next substituents would be introduced.

Wait, but for the target, the nitro group is at position 3, and the other substituents are at positions 1 and 2.

Hmm, maybe it's better to think about the substituents in the order of their introduction.

Let me think: perhaps we need to perform nitration, then introduce the ethoxy group, then introduce the tert-butyl group, but I'm not sure.

Another approach is to realize that the nitro group is a meta director, so any substituent added after it would be directed meta to the nitro. But I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to think about the steps required. Let's break down the target molecule.

The target is 2-t-Bu-1-OEt-3-NO2 benzene.

So, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. That's positions adjacent in a row.

Let me imagine the benzene ring as being numbered clockwise: position 1 (OEt), 2 (t-Bu), 3 (NO2), so positions 1,2,3 are in a row.

Alternatively, perhaps the positions are as follows: OEt at position 1, t-Bu at position 2 (next to OEt), and NO2 at position 3 (next to t-Bu).

So, in this arrangement, the substituents are arranged in a way that each is adjacent to the next.

But how do we achieve this through electrophilic substitution?

Another approach is to think about the directing effects. Each substituent directs the next to a specific position.

Let me consider the order of substitution:

If we first add a tert-butyl group, which is activating and o/p-directing. Then, adding an ethoxy group would be directed to either ortho or para to the t-Bu group. But wait, the ethoxy group in the target is at position 1, while the t-Bu is at position 2. So, that would be adjacent—so perhaps the ethoxy is added ortho to the t-Bu.

Then, the next substituent is nitro. But where would that go?

Wait, after adding ethoxy and t-Bu, the next substituent would be directed by the existing groups.

Wait, let's try an example.

First, introduce t-Bu on benzene. So, benzene becomes t-butylbenzene.

Next, introduce ethoxy group. Since t-Bu is an activating, o/p-directing group, the ethoxy would enter ortho or para to t-Bu. If we have t-Bu at position 2, then ethoxy could go to position 1 (ortho) or 4 (para). But in the target, ethoxy is at position 1, which is ortho to t-Bu. So that works.

Now, the next substituent is nitro. The existing groups are t-Bu (activating, o/p) and ethoxy (activating, o/p). So, the ring is activated, and the next substituent (nitro) would enter where? Nitro is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. But wait, nitro is introduced via nitration, which is an electrophilic substitution. Wait, no, nitration is an electrophilic substitution where the nitro group is added as an electrophile.

Wait, but once the ring has activating groups, nitration would occur in positions directed by the most powerful activating group. But nitro is a deactivating group, so we have to think about whether the ring is activated enough for nitration.

Wait, but if the ring already has activating groups, the nitration may be difficult because nitration is typically done under strong acid conditions, and the ring is activated towards electrophilic attack.

Wait, but let me think about the order again.

Suppose we have benzene.

Step 1: Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-BuCl (AlCl3) to get t-butylbenzene.

Step 2: Introduce ethoxy group. Since the ring is activated by t-Bu, ethoxy can be introduced via, say, an etherification reaction. Wait, but how do you introduce an ethoxy group via electrophilic substitution? Alternatively, perhaps we can perform a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that's not common for benzene without activating groups.

Wait, another approach: perhaps we can perform a substitution reaction where a leaving group is present. For example, if we have a nitro group first, we could substitute it with an ethoxy group. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the ethoxy group via a nitration followed by some substitution, but that seems a bit off.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the steps each option is suggesting and see which sequence would give the correct positions.

Looking at the options, each option lists a sequence of reactions. Let's look at the options and see which makes sense.

Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration), ii) Fe/HCl (probably reduction), iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts), iv) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration again?), etc. Hmm, that might not be right.

Wait, perhaps it's better to go step by step.

Each option lists a sequence of reactions. Let's take option B as an example.

Option B: i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts to add t-Bu), ii) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration), iii) Fe/HCl (maybe reduction, like in Gattermann-Koch?), iv) HNO3 again, etc. Hmm, but adding nitro after t-Bu would have the nitro group enter ortho or para to t-Bu, but the target has nitro at position 3, which is adjacent to t-Bu at position 2 and OEt at 1.

Wait, perhaps the order is: first add the OEt group, then t-Bu, then nitro.

But how to add OEt? Maybe through a substitution.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution after activating the ring with a strong electron-withdrawing group.

Wait, like first nitrate benzene, then sulfonate it, then substitute the nitro group with ethoxy.

Wait, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps let's think about the directing effects.

If we have a ring with OEt and t-Bu, adding nitro would be directed by the existing substituents. But nitro is a strong deactivating group, so perhaps it's best to add it last, when the ring is more activated.

Wait, but the target has nitro at position 3, which is adjacent to t-Bu at 2. So perhaps after adding t-Bu and OEt, the nitro is added in a position that's adjacent to t-Bu, but considering the directing effects.

Wait, but OEt and t-Bu are both activating and o/p-directing. So, if the ring has both, where would the next substituent go?

It would likely go to a position that's ortho or para to both. But in a benzene ring, if you have two substituents in adjacent positions, the third would have to be in a specific spot.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added in a position that is ortho to one substituent and meta to another.

Hmm.

Another angle: the target has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. So, after adding substituent A, where would substituent B go? Then substituent C.

Let me imagine the order:

1. Add OEt group.

2. Add t-Bu group.

3. Add nitro group.

So, benzene → OEt benzene → t-Bu added in a position relative to OEt.

But where would t-Bu go relative to OEt?

OEt is activating, o/p-directing. So when adding t-Bu, it would go ortho or para to OEt.

Suppose OEt is at position 1. Then t-Bu would go at position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para). But in the target, t-Bu is at position 2. So that works.

Now, after adding OEt and t-Bu, the next substituent is nitro. Where would it go?

The existing substituents are OEt at 1, t-Bu at 2.

The ring is activated (since both substituents are activating), so nitration would occur where?

Wait, nitration is an electrophilic substitution. The nitronium ion is the electrophile. The activating groups (OEt and t-Bu) would direct the incoming nitro group to positions ortho or para to themselves.

But there's competition for where the nitro group goes.

Looking at the current substituents:

OEt is at 1, t-Bu at 2.

The possible positions for nitration would be:

- Ortho to OEt: positions 2 and 6.

But position 2 is already occupied by t-Bu.

- Para to OEt: position 4.

- Ortho to t-Bu: positions 1 and 3.

Position 1 is OEt, so position 3 would be possible.

- Para to t-Bu: position 5.

So, the available positions are 3,4,5,6.

But considering the substituents, where is the most activated position?

Since both OEt and t-Bu are activating and o/p-directing, the most activated positions would be ortho to either substituent.

So, position 3 is ortho to t-Bu (at 2), and position 6 is ortho to OEt (at 1, which is adjacent to 2).

Wait, but in the target, the nitro is at position 3, which is adjacent to t-Bu at 2.

So, perhaps after adding OEt (position 1) and t-Bu (position 2), the next step is nitration, which would occur at position 3 (ortho to t-Bu).

That would give the target structure.

So the order would be:

1. OEt substitution.

2. t-Bu substitution.

3. Nitration.

But how do we perform OEt substitution? Because benzene itself doesn't typically undergo nucleophilic substitution. So perhaps we need to use a different approach.

Ah! Maybe we can use a directing group. For example, if we first nitrate benzene, then convert the nitro group into a leaving group, which can then be substituted with OEt.

Wait, but that would require introducing a nitro group first, then replacing it. Let's think about that.

Alternative approach:

1. Nitration of benzene: introduces nitro at position 1.

2. Reduction of nitro to amine (using Fe/HCl, for example).

3. Then, perhaps sulfonation to make a good leaving group?

Wait, but I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps we can do a nitration followed by a Birch reduction to introduce a ring-opening, but that's probably not helpful here.

Wait, another thought: perhaps to introduce the OEt group, we can perform a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. For that, the ring needs to be strongly activated towards nucleophilic attack, which usually requires strong electron-withdrawing groups.

So, first, nitrate benzene to introduce a nitro group (which is a strong meta director). Then, perhaps introduce another nitro group at a suitable position, and then perform a substitution.

Wait, perhaps that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts etherification, but that's usually not feasible because alcohols are not good for Friedel-Crafts. Alternatively, perhaps using an ethyl halide under certain conditions.

Wait, but wait. Another way to introduce an ethoxy group is via a substitution reaction on a nitro group. For example, if benzene is first nitrated, then the nitro group is converted into a good leaving group, and then substituted with OEt.

But how to do that?

Wait, perhaps we can perform a nitration, then reduce the nitro group to an amino group (using, say, Fe/HCl), then treat the amino group as a leaving group. But wait, amino groups are not good leaving groups. Alternatively, we can convert the amino group into a diazonium salt, then perform a substitution.

Wait, let me think.

Benzene → nitration → nitrobenzene.

Nitrobenzene → reduction (e.g., with Fe/HCl) → aniline.

Aniline → diazotization (with NaNO2 and HCl at low temp) → diazonium chloride.

Then, the diazonium group can be replaced with a good leaving group, like a sulfonic acid group (using H2SO4 and H2O?), but I'm not sure.

Wait, but perhaps we can perform a substitution reaction where the amino group is replaced by a leaving group like a tosylate or something, then substitute that with ethoxy.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use a different approach, such as using a nucleophilic substitution on a sulfonated ring.

Wait, perhaps sulfonating benzene to make it more reactive towards nucleophilic substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps we can first introduce a strong electron-withdrawing group, then perform a substitution.

Wait, perhaps the strategy is:

1. Nitration of benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Sulfonation of nitrobenzene → 3-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.

3. Then, substitute the nitro group with ethoxy via nucleophilic aromatic substitution.

But then, how to replace the nitro group with OEt.

Wait, but nitro groups are meta directors, and substitution reactions require activation. So, perhaps if we have a nitro group and a sulfonic acid group, which are both strong meta directors, the substitution might be possible.

Alternatively, perhaps this is getting too complicated, and I should look at the options again.

Looking at the options, each option has a sequence of reactions. Let's take a closer look.

Option A:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation, adds t-Bu to benzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

iv) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

v) dilute H2SO4 → acid workup.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → perhaps a Williamson ether synthesis.

viii) Fe/HCl → reduction.

ix) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

Hmm, that seems a long sequence. Let's see.

But the target has three substituents, so the sequence must account for adding three groups.

Option B:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → add t-Bu.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduction (convert nitro to amine?).

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis (maybe to form amine or something else).

vii) NaOH/EtBr → perhaps an SN2 reaction, like replacing a leaving group with ethoxy.

viii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

ix) dilute H2SO4 → acid.

Hmm, unclear. Maybe this sequence adds t-Bu, nitro, then another nitro, then substitution.

Not sure.

Option C:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → add t-Bu.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis.

viii) dilute H2SO4 → acid.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → substitution.

Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iii) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → add t-Bu.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate.

vii) dilute H2SO4 → acid.

viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → substitution.

So, each option adds t-Bu and nitro groups in different orders, and uses other reagents like SO3, Fe/HCl, NaNO2, etc.

Let me try to think of the correct order.

The target has nitro at position 3, which is adjacent to t-Bu at 2 and OEt at 1.

So, perhaps the nitro group is added after the OEt and t-Bu are in place.

But how to add OEt and t-Bu in the correct positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added first, then OEt and t-Bu.

Wait, if nitro is first, then it directs the next substituent to meta position.

But let's think.

If first nitro is added to benzene, it will be at position 1 (since benzene can be nitrated at any position, but for simplicity, let's say meta isn't applicable until multiple substituents are present).

Wait, no. After the first nitration, the nitro group is at some position, say position 1.

Then, adding OEt would be directed by the nitro group.

Nitro is a meta director, so the OEt would go meta to nitro, position 4.

Then, adding t-Bu would be directed by the existing substituents (nitro and OEt).

But in the target, OEt is at 1, t-Bu at 2, nitro at 3. So this approach may not work.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is OEt first, then t-Bu, then nitro.

But how to introduce OEt.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the steps each option suggests.

Looking at option D: i) nitration, ii) Fe/HCl (reduce nitro to amine), iii) t-BuCl/AlCl3 (add t-Bu), iv) nitration again, etc.

Wait, after first nitration, you have nitrobenzene. Then, reduce nitro to amine: you get aniline.

Then, perform Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-BuCl: but wait, aniline is strongly activating, but Friedel-Crafts alkylation is typically done on activated rings. However, aniline is so activating that it can undergo Friedel-Crafts.

Wait, but wait: Aniline is a strong activating group, so Friedel-Crafts would proceed. So adding t-Bu to aniline would direct it to ortho or para positions.

But position 1 is where nitro was, which is now an amine.

So, after reducing nitro to amine (position 1), adding t-Bu would go ortho or para to the amine. Let's say it goes to position 2 (ortho).

Then, next step: iv) nitration again. Now, the ring has amine at 1, t-Bu at 2.

Amine is a strong activating, ortho/para director. t-Bu is activating, ortho/para.

So, where would the nitro group go? It would go to a position activated by either the amine or t-Bu.

Amine is more activating, so nitration would likely occur ortho or para to the amine.

So, possible positions are 2 (t-Bu is there), 3 (ortho to amine), 4 (para to amine). So, nitro might go to position 3 or 4.

If it goes to position 3, that would be adjacent to t-Bu, which aligns with the target.

So, after nitration at position 3, the substituents would be amine at 1, t-Bu at 2, nitro at 3.

Then, steps v) to ix) involve diazotization, sulfonation, acid treatment, hydrolysis, and substitution.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps after adding nitro at position 3, the next steps are to convert the amine to a diazonium salt and then perform a substitution with ethoxy.

Wait, let me think.

Option D's steps after nitration (iv) are:

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization of the amine (position 1) → forms diazonium salt.

vi) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate the ring? Or perhaps sulfonation is a step elsewhere.

Wait, after diazotization, if we heat with H2O and H3O+, the diazonium salt can undergo hydrolysis to form a hydroxyl group. So, step viii is H3O+, H2O/Heat, which could convert the diazonium to a hydroxyl.

But in our target, the substituent at position 1 is OEt, not OH. So, perhaps after forming the hydroxyl group, we perform an etherification.

Then, step ix is NaOH/EtBr, which is a typical condition for an SN2 reaction, like replacing a bromide with an ethoxy group. But how does that happen?

Wait, perhaps the hydroxyl group is transformed into a good leaving group (like a bromide) via treatment with H2SO4 (sulfonation?), but I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps after forming the hydroxyl group at position 1, we can perform a substitution reaction by converting the -OH into a leaving group, like a tosylate, and then substitute it with ethoxy.

But in option D, after hydrolysis, step ix is NaOH and EtBr. So, perhaps the OH is treated with EtBr in basic conditions to form OEt via an SN2 mechanism.

Wait, O- is a good nucleophile in basic conditions. So, if we have a phenolic OH group, we can make it into a phenoxide ion in NaOH, which can attack an ethyl bromide (EtBr) in an SN2 reaction, replacing Br with OEt.

So, putting it all together, the steps in option D would be:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

3. Friedel-Crafts alkylation → add t-Bu at position 2 (ortho to amine).

4. Nitrate again → add nitro at position 3 (ortho to t-Bu and meta to amine? Or directed by the amine).

Wait, after steps i-iv, the substituents are amine (1), t-Bu (2), nitro (3).

Then, step v: diazotization (amine → diazonium at 1).

Step vi: SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate the ring? Or perhaps sulfonate the nitro group? Not sure.

Wait, but in step vi, the ring has nitro at 3. Sulfonation would add a -SO3H group, which is a strong EWG and meta-directing.

But this might complicate things further.

Alternatively, perhaps after nitration, we do not sulfonate, but instead go to diazotization.

After diazotization, step vii is dilute H2SO4 → perhaps acid workup, leading to a phenol.

Then, step viii is H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis of diazonium to OH.

Finally, step ix: NaOH and EtBr → substitution of OH with OEt.

So, putting it all together, the substituents would be:

Original benzene → nitration → nitro at 1.

Reduction → amine at 1.

Friedel-Crafts → t-Bu at 2 (ortho to amine).

Nitration → nitro at 3 (since amine is activating, directs nitro to ortho or para. But position 2 is taken, so nitro goes to 3 or 4. Let's say 3.

Then, amine at 1 is converted to diazonium, which is then hydrolyzed to OH at 1.

Then, OH is substituted with OEt.

So, substituents are OEt at 1, t-Bu at 2, nitro at 3. Which matches the target.

So, the reaction sequence in option D would achieve this.

Looking back at option D:

i) Nitrate → nitro at 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine at 1.

iii) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → add t-Bu at 2.

iv) nitrate again → add nitro at 3.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization of amine at 1.

vi) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate (but I'm not sure, perhaps a different step).

Wait, but step vi in option D is SO3, which is sulfonation, but I'm not entirely clear on why that step is there. Alternatively, perhaps it's part of a different process.

Wait, after nitration at step iv, the ring has nitro at 3, amine at 1, t-Bu at 2.

Then, step v: diazotization converts amine at 1 to diazonium.

Step vi: sulfonate? Maybe sulfonate the ring to activate a position, but perhaps this is not necessary. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo or I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps after step iv, the ring has three substituents: amine, t-Bu, nitro. Then, step v: diazotization of amine to form diazonium at 1.

Step vi: SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate, maybe to position 3 (but it already has nitro), or another position.

Wait, perhaps the SO3 step is part of the sulfonation process to activate the ring for another substitution, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the SO3 step is part of the nitration process, but that doesn't make sense.

Hmm, perhaps I should think of the steps differently. Let's outline the steps for option D:

1. Nitration: benzene → nitrobenzene (position 1).

2. Fe/HCl: reduces nitro to amine → aniline (position 1).

3. Friedel-Crafts: add t-Bu at position 2 (ortho to amine).

4. Nitration: add nitro at position 3 (ortho to t-Bu, since t-Bu is activating).

5. Diazotization: amine at 1 → diazonium.

6. SO3/H2SO4: sulfonate → perhaps at position 4 or somewhere else.

Wait, but I'm not sure why sulfonation is needed. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different step, like forming a different intermediate.

7. Dilute H2SO4: acid workup, perhaps hydrolyzing the diazonium to phenol.

8. H3O+/H2O/Heat: hydrolysis of diazonium salt to OH at position 1.

9. NaOH/EtBr: substitution of OH with OEt.

So, the final substituents are OEt (1), t-Bu (2), nitro (3). Which matches the target.

So, the steps in option D would lead to the desired product.

Looking back at the options, option D lists the steps as:

i) Nitration

ii) Reduction (Fe/HCl)

iii) Friedel-Crafts (t-Bu)

iv) Nitration

v) Diazotization

vi) Sulfonation

vii) Dilute H2SO4

viii) H3O+/H2O/Heat

ix) NaOH/EtBr.

So, the key steps are correct: nitration, reduction, alkylation, nitration, diazotization, hydrolysis, substitution.

Thus, the correct option is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene, the sequence of reactions must carefully introduce the substituents in the correct positions while considering their directing effects. The target molecule has three substituents: a tert-butyl group at position 2, an ethoxy group at position 1, and a nitro group at position 3. These substituents are adjacent to each other in a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene arrangement.

### Key Analysis of the Reaction Sequence in Option D:
1. **Nitration (i)**: Benzene is first nitrated to introduce a nitro group at position 1. Nitro is a strong electron-withdrawing group and a meta-director.

2. **Reduction (ii)**: The nitro group at position 1 is reduced to an amine group using Fe/HCl. The amine group is a strong electron-donating group and an ortho/para-director.

3. **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation (iii)**: A Friedel-Crafts reaction with tert-butyl chloride (t-BuCl) and AlCl3 introduces the tert-butyl group. The amine group directs the tert-butyl group to position 2 (ortho to the amine).

4. **Nitration (iv)**: The ring is nitrated again. The amine group (position 1) and the tert-butyl group (position 2) are both ortho/para-directing and activating. The nitro group is introduced at position 3, which is ortho to the tert-butyl group.

5. **Diazotization (v)**: The amine group at position 1 is converted to a diazonium salt using NaNO2/HCl.

6. **Hydrolysis (viii)**: The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed under acidic conditions (H3O+, H2O/Heat) to form a hydroxyl group (-OH) at position 1.

7. **Substitution (ix)**: The hydroxyl group at position 1 is replaced with an ethoxy group (-OEt) using NaOH and ethyl bromide (EtBr). This substitution occurs via an SN2 mechanism, forming the final product.

### Final Product:
The sequence of reactions in Option D successfully introduces the substituents in the correct positions: tert-butyl at position 2, ethoxy at position 1, and nitro at position 3. This matches the structure of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.

### Conclusion:
Option D provides the correct sequence of reactions to achieve the desired product.
