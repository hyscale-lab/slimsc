Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about gene interactions in white lupine related to anthracnose resistance. We have three genes: G1, G2, G3. They made knock-out mutants and double mutants, and tested their resistance.

The data shows the resistance percentage compared to the wild-type control (which is 100%). Let's list the data again:

- g1: 75%
- g2: 0%
- g3: 50%
- g1g3: 10%
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0%

Hmm, first, I remember that in genetics, when a double mutant has a more severe phenotype than either single mutant, it suggests epistasis. So, maybe one gene is upstream of another.

We also know that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream. Transcription factors usually regulate other genes. If a gene is a transcription factor, knocking it out would affect the expression of downstream genes.

Looking at the results:

G2 knockout has 0% resistance. That's really bad—completely susceptible. G1 has 75%, G3 has 50%. So G2 is very important. Maybe G2 is the transcription factor because its knockout is the most severe.

Wait, but what about the double mutants? Let's see:

g1g2 is 0%—so when both G1 and G2 are knocked out, it's as bad as G2 alone. Hmm, but G2 alone is already 0%. So in the double mutant, the resistance doesn't get any worse than G2. So maybe G2 is upstream of G1. Because if both are non-functional, the phenotype is same as G2.

Similarly, g2g3 is 0%, which is same as G2. So that suggests that G3 is downstream of G2 as well. Because without G2, knocking out G3 doesn't change anything.

What about g1g3? Their resistance is 10%—which is worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So when both G1 and G3 are out, the resistance drops more. That suggests that G1 and G3 might be in separate pathways, and knocking both out exacerbates the problem. Alternatively, maybe they function in parallel pathways.

Wait, but the question says that at least one is a transcription factor upstream of others. So perhaps G2 is the transcription factor, regulating G1 and G3.

If G2 is a TF, then G1 and G3 are downstream. Let's see:

In the g2 mutant, both downstream genes aren't expressed, so resistance is 0%. But in g1, resistance is 75%, which is better than g2. That suggests that G1's function contributes to resistance, but without G2, it's not enough.

Wait, but if G2 is a TF that activates G1 and G3, then knocking out G2 would cause both G1 and G3 not to be expressed. But in g1, G2 is still present. So G2 is active, so G3 would be expressed. But in g1, G2 is present, so G3 is active.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think. If G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1 and G3, then in the g2 mutant, both G1 and G3 are not expressed. But in g1, G2 is present, so G3 is expressed. Similarly, in g3, G2 is present, so G1 is expressed.

So looking at phenotypes:

g2 has 0% resistance—so without G2, neither G1 nor G3 is active. So both are necessary for resistance. Hmm, but that's a bit unclear.

Wait, the g1 mutant has 75% resistance. So without G1, but G2 is there. Then, G3 is active. So 75% is better than 50% (g3 alone). Hmm, that suggests that G3 alone gives 50% resistance, and with G1 (if G2 is present), it's better. Wait, but without G2, neither is active.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think about the double mutants.

g1g2: 0% resistance. Since G2 is a TF, if it's knocked out, G1 and G3 can't be active. So that makes sense.

g2g3: 0%. Similarly, because without G2, G3 doesn't matter.

g1g3: 10% which is worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the phenotype is worse than either single. So maybe G1 and G3 are in separate pathways that contribute to resistance. So when both are gone, the resistance is much lower.

So perhaps G2 is the transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. Without G2, both G1 and G3 can't contribute, leading to 0% resistance.

But in the case of g1, G2 is functional. So G3 is active. So g1's resistance is 75%—which is higher than when G3 is alone (g3:50%). So maybe G1 and G3 work in the same pathway or in parallel pathways.

Wait, but if G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, then knocking out both would have more severe effect than either alone. That's what we see in g1g3: 10%, which is less than both. So that suggests that G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, each contributing to resistance. So when both are gone, the resistance drops below either single mutant.

So, putting this together: G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. G1 and G3 are in separate pathways. When either G1 or G3 is knocked out, you still have some resistance from the other. But when both are gone, plus G2 is functional, then resistance is worse.

Wait, no. Because in g1, G2 is functional. So G3 is active. So in g1, resistance is 75%—so higher than g3's 50%. So maybe G1 contributes more than G3, or they act in parallel, with G1 being more effective.

Alternatively, perhaps G3 is downstream of G1. But I'm not sure. Let's think about the data again.

Looking at the double mutants:

g1g2:0% same as G2. So G2 is upstream of G1.

g2g3:0%, same as G2, so G2 is upstream of G3.

g1g3:10% which is lower than both g1 (75%) and g3 (50%). So their combined knockout is worse than either, but not as bad as 0%.

Wait, but why is the resistance worse when both G1 and G3 are knocked out? Maybe they contribute to different parts of the resistance mechanism. So without both, the plant is more susceptible.

So, the hierarchy is G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3. G1 and G3 are in separate pathways. So, their function doesn't directly influence each other.

So, which option fits this?

Looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Wait, pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits. Not sure if that's relevant here.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter (maybe same regulatory region?), G3 epistatic towards G1.

Hmm, same promoter would imply they are co-regulated, perhaps by G2 as a TF.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy again. Not sure.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy is when two genes have overlapping functions. So knocking both out would have a worse effect than either alone.

In our case, when both G1 and G3 are knocked out (g1g3), the resistance is 10% which is worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So that suggests redundancy because each contributes, and their combined loss is worse.

Wait, but if they are redundant, the double mutant would have a more severe phenotype than either single. So g1g3 at 10% is worse than g1 (75) or g3 (50). So that fits redundancy.

So, if G2 is the TF (as all the data points suggest), then G1 and G3 are under its regulation and have redundant functions.

So, in the g1g3 double mutant, the effect is additive, leading to lower resistance.

So, which option says G2 is TF and G1 and G3 are redundant?

Looking at options:

Option D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, what's epistasis? If gene A is epistatic to gene B, then the phenotype of gene A's mutation masks the effect of gene B's mutation. Or, when both are mutated, the phenotype is same as the one with the epistatic gene.

In our case, the double mutants:

g1g3 has 10% resistance. The single mutants: g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%. So the double is worse than either. So the effect isn't masking; it's additive. So maybe they are in parallel pathways.

Wait, but if G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, then knocking both out would not necessarily make it worse. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe G1 is upstream of G3. So, if G1 is knocked out, G3 can't be expressed. But in the data, g3 (where G3 is knocked out) has 50% resistance, whereas g1 has 75%. That doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe G3 is downstream of G1. Then, in g1, G3 can't be expressed, leading to a compromised resistance. But in g3, G1 is still active, so higher resistance than g3. Hmm, but the data shows g1 has 75% which is higher than g3's 50.

Wait, that's confusing. Because if G3 is downstream, then without G1, G3 wouldn't be expressed. So in g1, G3 is not active, but g1's resistance is 75%, which is better than g3's 50%. That suggests that G3 contributes negatively, which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 is a transcription factor for G3. But then, if G1 is knocked out, G3 isn't expressed. But in our case, when G1 is knocked out (g1), resistance is 75%, which is better than when G3 is knocked out (g3 is 50%). So if G3 is necessary for resistance, then knocking out G1 (so G3 isn't expressed) should make the plant more susceptible. But g1 is 75%, which is better than 50% of g3. That's the opposite. So maybe G3 is not necessary but G1 is. Hmm.

Another angle: Let's consider that G2 is the transcription factor, so without G2, G1 and G3 aren't expressed. So, in the g2 mutant, both are off, leading to 0% resistance.

In the g1 mutant, G2 is present so G3 is expressed. And since G3 is expressed, the resistance is better than when G3 is knocked out (g3 has 50%). So in g1, with G3 active, resistance is 75%—higher than g3's 50%. So G3 alone gives 50%, but with G1 (and G2) active, it's 75%.

Wait, but if G2 is the TF activating G1 and G3, then in g1, G2 is active, so G3 is expressed. So perhaps G3 contributes to some part of the resistance, but when G1 is also present, it enhances that. Or maybe G1 is a TF for other genes, but not necessarily related to G3.

Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are both part of the same pathway, but each contribute something different. So knocking out both would have a more severe effect.

But let's go back to the options. So in the options, the key points would be:

- Which gene is the transcription factor (G2 in all relevant options except A).

Looking at the options:

Option D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, redundancy would mean that when both are knocked out, the effect is more severe than either alone. That's what we see in g1g3 (10% vs 75 and 50). So that fits.

Now, what does it mean that G1 is epistatic towards G3? Epistatic means that the mutation in G1 masks the effect of G3's mutation. So in the double mutant, the phenotype is the same as the more severe of the two. But in our case, g1g3 is worse than either. So, perhaps in this case, the genes are additive rather than one masking the other.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting the epistasis concept wrong. Let me think again. Epistasis is when the phenotype of one gene's mutation masks the phenotype of another gene's mutation. So if gene A is epistatic to gene B, then a mutation in A will determine the phenotype regardless of B's mutation.

So, in this case, looking at the double mutants:

g1g3: 10%. So, if G1 is epistatic towards G3, then the phenotype would be the same as g1 (75%) or g3 (50%)? But 10% is worse than either. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe G3 is epistatic towards G1. Then, the double mutant would have the same as g3 (50%). But in our case, it's 10%—so that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps this is a case of negative epistasis. So, when two mutations combine, the effect is more severe than either. So, the combination is worse than either single mutation. That's called negative epistasis.

If that's the case, then the genes are in separate pathways. Because if they were in the same pathway, you wouldn't see additive effects. So, in our case, G1 and G3 are in separate pathways. So, without either, the plant's resistance is lower, but without both, it's even worse.

So, does this fit into any of the options?

Looking again:

Option D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. But in our case, the double mutant is worse than each single, which suggests redundancy. But then, how about the epistasis part?

Alternatively, perhaps the text is using 'epistatic towards' in a way that refers to the order in the pathway. Maybe G1 is upstream of G3. So, G1 is epistatic to G3 because if G1 is non-functional, G3's activity doesn't matter.

Wait, but in the g1g3 double mutant, the resistance is lower than either single. So, that suggests that the two genes are in separate pathways. Because if G1 were upstream of G3, then in g1, G3 wouldn't be expressed (assuming G1 activates G3). So in g1, you'd have 0% if G3's function is necessary. But in our data, g1 has 75% resistance. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 function in parallel pathways, so each contributes additively to the resistance. So without G1, you lose some resistance, but G3 can compensate a bit. Without G3, G1 can compensate. But without both, you lose all their contributions.

So, in that case, the double mutant's resistance is additive, which is lower than either single.

So, that would support the idea of redundancy. So, G1 and G3 are redundant in providing resistance.

So, looking back at the options, option D says G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but redundancy would mean that each gene can compensate for the other. So, knocking both out would have a more severe effect than either alone.

So, that fits with our data. So, the option D seems to fit.

But wait, the option says G1 is epistatic towards G3. So, in the double mutant, does the phenotype match that of G1 or G3?

In our case, the double mutant (g1g3) is 10%, which is worse than either. So, that doesn't fit the standard epistasis model where one masks the other. So perhaps the epistasis term isn't the right concept here. Or maybe the option is using it in a different way.

Alternatively, perhaps the option is trying to say that G1 is epistatic to G3 in a different way. Maybe G1 is downstream of G3. Wait, that complicates things.

Wait, another approach. What's the definition of epistasis in terms of gene position? If two genes are in a linear pathway, and one is upstream of the other, then the upstream gene is epistatic to the downstream gene. Because the mutation in the upstream gene (epistatic) affects the pathway regardless of the downstream gene's state.

So, in the case where G2 is upstream of G1 and G3, G2 would be epistatic to both G1 and G3. Because if G2 is knocked out, whether G1 or G3 are present doesn't matter—no resistance.

From the data, the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 both have 0% resistance, same as g2. So, G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

So, in the options, which one says that G2 is the TF and is epistatic?

Looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is TF. So probably not.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter, G3 epistatic towards G1.

So, G3 is epistatic to G1. So, in the g1g3 double mutant, the phenotype would be same as g3 (50%). But in our data, it's 10%, which is worse. So that doesn't fit.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits. Not sure about that. But if G1 is epistatic towards G3, then in double mutant, the phenotype would be like G1 (75%). But our data is worse than both, so that doesn't fit.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

So, if G1 is epistatic towards G3, then in the double mutant, the phenotype should be same as G1 (75%). But our data is 10%, which is worse, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps the correct option is none of these. But wait, the options must include the correct one.

Wait, perhaps the double mutants' data can help identify which gene is epistatic.

So, in the g1g2 double mutant, the resistance is 0% (same as g2). So, G2 is epistatic to G1, because when G2 is knocked out, the presence of G1 doesn't matter.

Similarly, in the g2g3 double mutant, it's 0% (same as g2), so G2 is epistatic to G3.

In the g1g3 double mutant, it's 10%, which is worse than either. So, G1 and G3 are not epistatic to each other; their effects are additive.

So, the conclusion is that G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3. G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, providing additive resistance.

Now, looking at the options to see which matches this.

Option D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. But in our analysis, G1 is not epistatic towards G3. Because the double mutant is worse than either. So that might not be correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think about what the options are saying.

Option D: G1 is epistatic towards G3. So, in the double mutant, the phenotype would be same as G1. But the double mutant is worse, so this doesn't fit. So, option D might not be correct.

Looking again, perhaps the correct option is A.

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Wait, no, because our data suggests G2 is the TF, not G1.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about what each option describes.

The data suggests that G2 is the TF, as its knockout is most severe.

G1 and G3 are both downstream of G2. They contribute to resistance but in separate pathways, leading to their combined knockout being worse than either alone.

So, in the options, which one says G2 is TF and G1 and G3 are in redundant pathways?

Looking at the options again:

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but if G1 and G3 are redundant, then the double mutant would be worse than both, which fits our data. So perhaps option D is correct.

But then the epistatic part: if G1 is epistatic towards G3, then in the double mutant, the resistance should be same as G1, which is 75%. But our data shows 10% in the double mutant, which is worse than both. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe the correct option is not D.

Looking at option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy means that one gene affects multiple traits. Not sure how that applies here.

Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are redundant. So, each contributes to the same function, so their combined knockout leads to worse resistance.

But then, what about the epistatic part?

Wait, maybe the term 'gene redundancy' is the key here.

In the case of redundancy, the two genes can compensate for each other. So, if one is knocked out, the other can still function. But if both are knocked out, the function is entirely lost, leading to a more severe phenotype.

In our case, g1 has 75% resistance, g3 has 50%, and g1g3 has 10%. So, the combined knockout is worse than either single. That suggests that each gene contributes some unique function, but they might not be entirely redundant.

Wait, maybe they are in parallel pathways. So, each can contribute to resistance, but without either, the resistance is worse.

So, perhaps they are not redundant but rather in parallel pathways.

So, the correct option would be that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, so knocking both out makes it worse. But none of the options directly say that.

Looking back at the options:

Option D says 'gene redundancy' which is when two genes have overlapping functions. So, perhaps the double mutant is worse than either, which fits our data.

So, perhaps option D is the right one.

But what about the epistasis part? The option says G1 is epistatic towards G3. So, in the double mutant, the resistance should be same as G1. But in our data, it's 10%, worse than both. So that doesn't fit. So maybe the epistatic part in the option is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the term 'epistatic towards' refers to the position in the pathway, not the phenotype. Like, G1 is epistatic to G3 in the sense that it's upstream. So, their combined mutation would have a phenotype that can't be predicted by either single.

But I'm not very sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is D, even though the epistatic part seems conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating the epistatic part. Let me think again.

Epistasis is about the interaction between genes where the effect of one gene is dependent on the presence of one or more 'modifier genes'. So, if G1 is epistatic to G3, the presence of a G1 mutation would determine the phenotype regardless of G3's mutation.

But in our case, when both are knocked out, the phenotype is worse than either, which suggests that they are additive, not epistatic.

So, perhaps the correct answer is not option D.

Wait, let me think about the options again. The correct conclusion should be that G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, which when both are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either (so, additive effects, not epistatic).

So, which option says that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in separate pathways (so their double mutant is worse than either single)?

Looking at the options, option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. Which means they have overlapping functions. So, their combined knockout is worse than either single. So that fits.

But then, the option also says G1 is epistatic towards G3. Which in our case, the double mutant is worse than either, which doesn't fit the standard definition of epistasis. So perhaps the option is incorrect in that aspect.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's think about another approach.

In the double mutants, g1g3 has 10% resistance. If G1 and G3 were in the same pathway, the double mutant would have the same resistance as the more severe single mutant. So, if G3 is in the same pathway as G1, and G3 is downstream, then in g1, G3 would not be expressed. So, the resistance would be same as in g1g3. But in our data, g1 is 75% and g1g3 is 10%, so that's not the case.

So, G1 and G3 must be in separate pathways. So their double mutant is additive.

So, the correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in separate pathways (so their functions are additive). So, the correct option should reflect that.

Looking at the options, none of them explicitly say 'in separate pathways'. Let's look again:

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy would imply that each can compensate for the other. But in our case, the double mutant is worse, which would fit redundancy. So perhaps that's the right term.

But the epistatic part might be wrong. But maybe the option's wording is a bit different.

Alternatively, perhaps the term 'epistatic towards' refers to the fact that G1 is upstream of G3. So, the pathway is G2 → G1 → G3.

Wait, but in that case, if G1 is knocked out, G3 wouldn't be expressed. So, the resistance in g1 would be same as in g1g3. But in our data, g1 is 75%, while g1g3 is 10%. So that's not the case.

So, perhaps they are in parallel pathways.

In that case, the correct conclusion is that G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are in separate (parallel) pathways. So, their combined knockout leads to a more severe phenotype.

Looking at the options, the only option that mentions G2 as TF is options B, C, D.

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. Redundancy would fit the additive effect.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's try to eliminate the options.

Option A: G1 is a TF. No, because g2 is the most severe.

Option B: G2 is TF. So possible. G1 and G3 have same promoter (same regulation). So when G2 is active, both are expressed. If G2 is not active, both are off.

But the data shows that when only G1 is knocked out, G3 is still on (since g1 has 75% which is higher than g3's 50%). So, this fits the same promoter idea.

But what about the epistasis part? Option B says G3 is epistatic towards G1.

So, in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance should be same as G3. G3's resistance is 50%, but in the data it's 10%. So that doesn't fit. So option B is incorrect.

Option C: G2 is TF. G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. Pleiotropy is one gene affecting multiple traits. I don't see how that applies here. Also, G1 is epistatic towards G3. So in g1g3, the resistance should be same as G1, which is 75%, but in our data it's 10%. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 redundancy, G1 epistatic towards G3.

Redundancy fits the additive effect. So, the double mutant is worse than either single. But the epistasis part is conflicting.

Wait, maybe in this option, G1 is epistatic towards G3 in the sense that the mutation in G1 affects G3's contribution. So, without G1, the function of G3 doesn't matter as much, but since in g1, G3 is active, the resistance is 75%, but when both are knocked out, it's worse.

Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D. Because the data supports that G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 are redundant (since their double mutant is worse than either), and G1 is epistatic towards G3, but the wording might not fit exactly. Or perhaps the 'epistatic towards' part is a distractor.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option A. No, because G2 is the TF according to the data.

Wait, another approach: think about the double mutant combinations.

The double mutants involving G2 (g1g2 and g2g3) have 0% resistance, same as g2. So, G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3.

The double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance. So, which is worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So, this suggests that G1 and G3 are in separate, additive pathways. So, the combined loss leads to a more severe phenotype.

So, in that case, how does this fit into the options?

Looking for an option where G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in separate, additive pathways.

Which option says that?

Option D says G1 and G3 show redundancy, which is a type of additive effect. So, perhaps D is the correct answer.

But the terminology in the option is a bit confusing. So, I think the best fit is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The experiment investigates the interaction of three genes (G1, G2, G3) in white lupine plants and their roles in resistance to anthracnose. The data shows resistance levels of single and double mutants compared to the wild-type control (100% resistance). The key findings are:

- **g1**: 75% resistance  
- **g2**: 0% resistance  
- **g3**: 50% resistance  
- **g1g3**: 10% resistance  
- **g2g3**: 0% resistance  
- **g1g2**: 0% resistance  

### Analysis:
1. **G2 as the Transcription Factor**:  
   The knockout of G2 results in 0% resistance, indicating that G2 is critical for resistance. This suggests G2 acts as a transcription factor upstream of other genes, as its absence abolishes resistance entirely.

2. **G1 and G3 in Separate Pathways**:  
   The double mutant **g1g3** shows 10% resistance, which is worse than either single mutant (g1: 75%, g3: 50%). This indicates that G1 and G3 contribute to resistance through separate pathways. Their combined knockout leads to an additive reduction in resistance, consistent with gene redundancy.

3. **Epistasis Between G1 and G3**:  
   The term "epistasis" implies that the mutation in one gene masks or modifies the phenotype of another. However, in this case, the double mutant **g1g3** has a phenotype worse than either single mutant, which does not fit the standard definition of epistasis. Instead, the interaction suggests that G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, and their combined loss exacerbates the phenotype.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. It claims G1 is the transcription factor, but the data shows G2 is the most critical gene, with g2 having 0% resistance.  
- **Option B**: Incorrect. While G2 is the transcription factor, the claim that G3 is epistatic to G1 is inconsistent with the data. The double mutant **g1g3** (10%) is worse than either single mutant, not the same as g3 (50%).  
- **Option C**: Incorrect. It claims G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, but there is no evidence that these genes affect multiple traits. Additionally, the claim that G1 is epistatic to G3 does not align with the data, as the double mutant **g1g3** is worse than either single mutant.  
- **Option D**: Correct. G2 is identified as the transcription factor, and the data supports that G1 and G3 are redundant (their combined knockout results in a worse phenotype than either single mutant). While the term "epistatic towards" is used, it may refer to the upstream regulation by G2 rather than direct epistasis between G1 and G3.

### Conclusion:
The data supports that G2 is the transcription factor, G1 and G3 are redundant genes contributing to resistance through separate pathways, and their combined knockout results in a more severe phenotype. This aligns with **Option D**.

Answer: D

Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about gene interactions in white lupine related to anthracnose resistance. We have three genes: G1, G2, G3. They made knock-out mutants and double mutants, and tested their resistance.

The data shows the resistance percentage compared to the wild-type control (which is 100%). Let's list the data again:

- g1: 75%
- g2: 0%
- g3: 50%
- g1g3: 10%
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0%

Hmm, first, I remember that in genetics, when a double mutant has a more severe phenotype than either single mutant, it suggests epistasis. So, maybe one gene is upstream of another.

We also know that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream. Transcription factors usually regulate other genes. If a gene is a transcription factor, knocking it out would affect the expression of downstream genes.

Looking at the results:

G2 knockout has 0% resistance. That's really bad—completely susceptible. G1 has 75%, G3 has 50%. So G2 is very important. Maybe G2 is the transcription factor because its knockout is the most severe.

Wait, but what about the double mutants? Let's see:

g1g2 is 0%—so when both G1 and G2 are knocked out, it's as bad as G2 alone. Hmm, but G2 alone is already 0%. So in the double mutant, the resistance doesn't get any worse than G2. So maybe G2 is upstream of G1. Because if both are non-functional, the phenotype is same as G2.

Similarly, g2g3 is 0%, which is same as G2. So that suggests that G3 is downstream of G2 as well. Because without G2, knocking out G3 doesn't change anything.

What about g1g3? Their resistance is 10%—which is worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So when both G1 and G3 are out, the resistance drops more. That suggests that G1 and G3 might be in separate pathways, and knocking both out exacerbates the problem. Alternatively, maybe they function in parallel pathways.

Wait, but the question says that at least one is a transcription factor upstream of others. So perhaps G2 is the transcription factor, regulating G1 and G3.

If G2 is a TF, then G1 and G3 are downstream. Let's see:

In the g2 mutant, both downstream genes aren't expressed, so resistance is 0%. But in g1, resistance is 75%, which is better than g2. That suggests that G1's function contributes to resistance, but without G2, it's not enough.

Wait, but if G2 is a TF that activates G1 and G3, then knocking out G2 would cause both G1 and G3 not to be expressed. But in g1, G2 is still present. So G2 is active, so G3 would be expressed. But in g1, G2 is present, so G3 is active.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think. If G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1 and G3, then in the g2 mutant, both G1 and G3 are not expressed. But in g1, G2 is present, so G3 is expressed. Similarly, in g3, G2 is present, so G1 is expressed.

So looking at phenotypes:

g2 has 0% resistance—so without G2, neither G1 nor G3 is active. So both are necessary for resistance. Hmm, but that's a bit unclear.

Wait, the g1 mutant has 75% resistance. So without G1, but G2 is there. Then, G3 is active. So 75% is better than 50% (g3 alone). Hmm, that suggests that G3 alone gives 50% resistance, and with G1 (if G2 is present), it's better. Wait, but without G2, neither is active.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think about the double mutants.

g1g2: 0% resistance. Since G2 is a TF, if it's knocked out, G1 and G3 can't be active. So that makes sense.

g2g3: 0%. Similarly, because without G2, G3 doesn't matter.

g1g3: 10% which is worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the phenotype is worse than either single. So maybe G1 and G3 are in separate pathways that contribute to resistance. So when both are gone, the resistance is much lower.

So perhaps G2 is the transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. Without G2, both G1 and G3 can't contribute, leading to 0% resistance.

But in the case of g1, G2 is functional. So G3 is active. So g1's resistance is 75%—which is higher than when G3 is alone (g3:50%). So maybe G1 and G3 work in the same pathway or in parallel pathways.

Wait, but if G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, then knocking out both would have more severe effect than either alone. That's what we see in g1g3: 10%, which is less than both. So that suggests that G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, each contributing to resistance. So when both are gone, the resistance drops below either single mutant.

So, putting this together: G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. G1 and G3 are in separate pathways. When either G1 or G3 is knocked out, you still have some resistance from the other. But when both are gone, plus G2 is functional, then resistance is worse.

Wait, no. Because in g1, G2 is functional. So G3 is active. So in g1, resistance is 75%—so higher than g3's 50%. So maybe G1 contributes more than G3, or they act in parallel, with G1 being more effective.

Alternatively, perhaps G3 is downstream of G1. But I'm not sure. Let's think about the data again.

Looking at the double mutants:

g1g2:0% same as G2. So G2 is upstream of G1.

g2g3:0%, same as G2, so G2 is upstream of G3.

g1g3:10% which is lower than both g1 (75%) and g3 (50%). So their combined knockout is worse than either, but not as bad as 0%.

Wait, but why is the resistance worse when both G1 and G3 are knocked out? Maybe they contribute to different parts of the resistance mechanism. So without both, the plant is more susceptible.

So, the hierarchy is G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3. G1 and G3 are in separate pathways. So, their function doesn't directly influence each other.

So, which option fits this?

Looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Wait, pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits. Not sure if that's relevant here.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter (maybe same regulatory region?), G3 epistatic towards G1.

Hmm, same promoter would imply they are co-regulated, perhaps by G2 as a TF.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy again. Not sure.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy is when two genes have overlapping functions. So knocking both out would have a worse effect than either alone.

In our case, when both G1 and G3 are knocked out (g1g3), the resistance is 10% which is worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So that suggests redundancy because each contributes, and their combined loss is worse.

Wait, but if they are redundant, the double mutant would have a more severe phenotype than either single. So g1g3 at 10% is worse than g1 (75) or g3 (50). So that fits redundancy.

So, if G2 is the TF (as all the data points suggest), then G1 and G3 are under its regulation and have redundant functions.

So, in the g1g3 double mutant, the effect is additive, leading to lower resistance.

So, which option says G2 is TF and G1 and G3 are redundant?

Looking at options:

Option D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, what's epistasis? If gene A is epistatic to gene B, then the phenotype of gene A's mutation masks the effect of gene B's mutation. Or, when both are mutated, the phenotype is same as the one with the epistatic gene.

In our case, the double mutants:

g1g3 has 10% resistance. The single mutants: g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%. So the double is worse than either. So the effect isn't masking; it's additive. So maybe they are in parallel pathways.

Wait, but if G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, then knocking both out would not necessarily make it worse. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe G1 is upstream of G3. So, if G1 is knocked out, G3 can't be expressed. But in the data, g3 (where G3 is knocked out) has 50% resistance, whereas g1 has 75%. That doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe G3 is downstream of G1. Then, in g1, G3 can't be expressed, leading to a compromised resistance. But in g3, G1 is still active, so higher resistance than g3. Hmm, but the data shows g1 has 75% which is higher than g3's 50.

Wait, that's confusing. Because if G3 is downstream, then without G1, G3 wouldn't be expressed. So in g1, G3 is not active, but g1's resistance is 75%, which is better than g3's 50%. That suggests that G3 contributes negatively, which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 is a transcription factor for G3. But then, if G1 is knocked out, G3 isn't expressed. But in our case, when G1 is knocked out (g1), resistance is 75%, which is better than when G3 is knocked out (g3 is 50%). So if G3 is necessary for resistance, then knocking out G1 (so G3 isn't expressed) should make the plant more susceptible. But g1 is 75%, which is better than 50% of g3. That's the opposite. So maybe G3 is not necessary but G1 is. Hmm.

Another angle: Let's consider that G2 is the transcription factor, so without G2, G1 and G3 aren't expressed. So, in the g2 mutant, both are off, leading to 0% resistance.

In the g1 mutant, G2 is present so G3 is expressed. And since G3 is expressed, the resistance is better than when G3 is knocked out (g3 has 50%). So in g1, with G3 active, resistance is 75%—higher than g3's 50%. So G3 alone gives 50%, but with G1 (and G2) active, it's 75%.

Wait, but if G2 is the TF activating G1 and G3, then in g1, G2 is active, so G3 is expressed. So perhaps G3 contributes to some part of the resistance, but when G1 is also present, it enhances that. Or maybe G1 is a TF for other genes, but not necessarily related to G3.

Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are both part of the same pathway, but each contribute something different. So knocking out both would have a more severe effect.

But let's go back to the options. So in the options, the key points would be:

- Which gene is the transcription factor (G2 in all relevant options except A).

Looking at the options:

Option D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, redundancy would mean that when both are knocked out, the effect is more severe than either alone. That's what we see in g1g3 (10% vs 75 and 50). So that fits.

Now, what does it mean that G1 is epistatic towards G3? Epistatic means that the mutation in G1 masks the effect of G3's mutation. So in the double mutant, the phenotype is the same as the more severe of the two. But in our case, g1g3 is worse than either. So, perhaps in this case, the genes are additive rather than one masking the other.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting the epistasis concept wrong. Let me think again. Epistasis is when the phenotype of one gene's mutation masks the phenotype of another gene's mutation. So if gene A is epistatic to gene B, then a mutation in A will determine the phenotype regardless of B's mutation.

So, in this case, looking at the double mutants:

g1g3: 10%. So, if G1 is epistatic towards G3, then the phenotype would be the same as g1 (75%) or g3 (50%)? But 10% is worse than either. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe G3 is epistatic towards G1. Then, the double mutant would have the same as g3 (50%). But in our case, it's 10%—so that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps this is a case of negative epistasis. So, when two mutations combine, the effect is more severe than either. So, the combination is worse than either single mutation. That's called negative epistasis.

If that's the case, then the genes are in separate pathways. Because if they were in the same pathway, you wouldn't see additive effects. So, in our case, G1 and G3 are in separate pathways. So, without either, the plant's resistance is lower, but without both, it's even worse.

So, does this fit into any of the options?

Looking again:

Option D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. But in our case, the double mutant is worse than each single, which suggests redundancy. But then, how about the epistasis part?

Alternatively, perhaps the text is using 'epistatic towards' in a way that refers to the order in the pathway. Maybe G1 is upstream of G3. So, G1 is epistatic to G3 because if G1 is non-functional, G3's activity doesn't matter.

Wait, but in the g1g3 double mutant, the resistance is lower than either single. So, that suggests that the two genes are in separate pathways. Because if G1 were upstream of G3, then in g1, G3 wouldn't be expressed (assuming G1 activates G3). So in g1, you'd have 0% if G3's function is necessary. But in our data, g1 has 75% resistance. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 function in parallel pathways, so each contributes additively to the resistance. So without G1, you lose some resistance, but G3 can compensate a bit. Without G3, G1 can compensate. But without both, you lose all their contributions.

So, in that case, the double mutant's resistance is additive, which is lower than either single.

So, that would support the idea of redundancy. So, G1 and G3 are redundant in providing resistance.

So, looking back at the options, option D says G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but redundancy would mean that each gene can compensate for the other. So, knocking both out would have a more severe effect than either alone.

So, that fits with our data. So, the option D seems to fit.

But wait, the option says G1 is epistatic towards G3. So, in the double mutant, does the phenotype match that of G1 or G3?

In our case, the double mutant (g1g3) is 10%, which is worse than either. So, that doesn't fit the standard epistasis model where one masks the other. So perhaps the epistasis term isn't the right concept here. Or maybe the option is using it in a different way.

Alternatively, perhaps the option is trying to say that G1 is epistatic to G3 in a different way. Maybe G1 is downstream of G3. Wait, that complicates things.

Wait, another approach. What's the definition of epistasis in terms of gene position? If two genes are in a linear pathway, and one is upstream of the other, then the upstream gene is epistatic to the downstream gene. Because the mutation in the upstream gene (epistatic) affects the pathway regardless of the downstream gene's state.

So, in the case where G2 is upstream of G1 and G3, G2 would be epistatic to both G1 and G3. Because if G2 is knocked out, whether G1 or G3 are present doesn't matter—no resistance.

From the data, the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 both have 0% resistance, same as g2. So, G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

So, in the options, which one says that G2 is the TF and is epistatic?

Looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is TF. So probably not.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter, G3 epistatic towards G1.

So, G3 is epistatic to G1. So, in the g1g3 double mutant, the phenotype would be same as g3 (50%). But in our data, it's 10%, which is worse. So that doesn't fit.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits. Not sure about that. But if G1 is epistatic towards G3, then in double mutant, the phenotype would be like G1 (75%). But our data is worse than both, so that doesn't fit.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

So, if G1 is epistatic towards G3, then in the double mutant, the phenotype should be same as G1 (75%). But our data is 10%, which is worse, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps the correct option is none of these. But wait, the options must include the correct one.

Wait, perhaps the double mutants' data can help identify which gene is epistatic.

So, in the g1g2 double mutant, the resistance is 0% (same as g2). So, G2 is epistatic to G1, because when G2 is knocked out, the presence of G1 doesn't matter.

Similarly, in the g2g3 double mutant, it's 0% (same as g2), so G2 is epistatic to G3.

In the g1g3 double mutant, it's 10%, which is worse than either. So, G1 and G3 are not epistatic to each other; their effects are additive.

So, the conclusion is that G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3. G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, providing additive resistance.

Now, looking at the options to see which matches this.

Option D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. But in our analysis, G1 is not epistatic towards G3. Because the double mutant is worse than either. So that might not be correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think about what the options are saying.

Option D: G1 is epistatic towards G3. So, in the double mutant, the phenotype would be same as G1. But the double mutant is worse, so this doesn't fit. So, option D might not be correct.

Looking again, perhaps the correct option is A.

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Wait, no, because our data suggests G2 is the TF, not G1.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about what each option describes.

The data suggests that G2 is the TF, as its knockout is most severe.

G1 and G3 are both downstream of G2. They contribute to resistance but in separate pathways, leading to their combined knockout being worse than either alone.

So, in the options, which one says G2 is TF and G1 and G3 are in redundant pathways?

Looking at the options again:

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but if G1 and G3 are redundant, then the double mutant would be worse than both, which fits our data. So perhaps option D is correct.

But then the epistatic part: if G1 is epistatic towards G3, then in the double mutant, the resistance should be same as G1, which is 75%. But our data shows 10% in the double mutant, which is worse than both. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe the correct option is not D.

Looking at option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy means that one gene affects multiple traits. Not sure how that applies here.

Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are redundant. So, each contributes to the same function, so their combined knockout leads to worse resistance.

But then, what about the epistatic part?

Wait, maybe the term 'gene redundancy' is the key here.

In the case of redundancy, the two genes can compensate for each other. So, if one is knocked out, the other can still function. But if both are knocked out, the function is entirely lost, leading to a more severe phenotype.

In our case, g1 has 75% resistance, g3 has 50%, and g1g3 has 10%. So, the combined knockout is worse than either single. That suggests that each gene contributes some unique function, but they might not be entirely redundant.

Wait, maybe they are in parallel pathways. So, each can contribute to resistance, but without either, the resistance is worse.

So, perhaps they are not redundant but rather in parallel pathways.

So, the correct option would be that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, so knocking both out makes it worse. But none of the options directly say that.

Looking back at the options:

Option D says 'gene redundancy' which is when two genes have overlapping functions. So, perhaps the double mutant is worse than either, which fits our data.

So, perhaps option D is the right one.

But what about the epistasis part? The option says G1 is epistatic towards G3. So, in the double mutant, the resistance should be same as G1. But in our data, it's 10%, worse than both. So that doesn't fit. So maybe the epistatic part in the option is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the term 'epistatic towards' refers to the position in the pathway, not the phenotype. Like, G1 is epistatic to G3 in the sense that it's upstream. So, their combined mutation would have a phenotype that can't be predicted by either single.

But I'm not very sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is D, even though the epistatic part seems conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating the epistatic part. Let me think again.

Epistasis is about the interaction between genes where the effect of one gene is dependent on the presence of one or more 'modifier genes'. So, if G1 is epistatic to G3, the presence of a G1 mutation would determine the phenotype regardless of G3's mutation.

But in our case, when both are knocked out, the phenotype is worse than either, which suggests that they are additive, not epistatic.

So, perhaps the correct answer is not option D.

Wait, let me think about the options again. The correct conclusion should be that G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, which when both are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either (so, additive effects, not epistatic).

So, which option says that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in separate pathways (so their double mutant is worse than either single)?

Looking at the options, option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. Which means they have overlapping functions. So, their combined knockout is worse than either single. So that fits.

But then, the option also says G1 is epistatic towards G3. Which in our case, the double mutant is worse than either, which doesn't fit the standard definition of epistasis. So perhaps the option is incorrect in that aspect.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's think about another approach.

In the double mutants, g1g3 has 10% resistance. If G1 and G3 were in the same pathway, the double mutant would have the same resistance as the more severe single mutant. So, if G3 is in the same pathway as G1, and G3 is downstream, then in g1, G3 would not be expressed. So, the resistance would be same as in g1g3. But in our data, g1 is 75% and g1g3 is 10%, so that's not the case.

So, G1 and G3 must be in separate pathways. So their double mutant is additive.

So, the correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in separate pathways (so their functions are additive). So, the correct option should reflect that.

Looking at the options, none of them explicitly say 'in separate pathways'. Let's look again:

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy would imply that each can compensate for the other. But in our case, the double mutant is worse, which would fit redundancy. So perhaps that's the right term.

But the epistatic part might be wrong. But maybe the option's wording is a bit different.

Alternatively, perhaps the term 'epistatic towards' refers to the fact that G1 is upstream of G3. So, the pathway is G2 → G1 → G3.

Wait, but in that case, if G1 is knocked out, G3 wouldn't be expressed. So, the resistance in g1 would be same as in g1g3. But in our data, g1 is 75%, while g1g3 is 10%. So that's not the case.

So, perhaps they are in parallel pathways.

In that case, the correct conclusion is that G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are in separate (parallel) pathways. So, their combined knockout leads to a more severe phenotype.

Looking at the options, the only option that mentions G2 as TF is options B, C, D.

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. Redundancy would fit the additive effect.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's try to eliminate the options.

Option A: G1 is a TF. No, because g2 is the most severe.

Option B: G2 is TF. So possible. G1 and G3 have same promoter (same regulation). So when G2 is active, both are expressed. If G2 is not active, both are off.

But the data shows that when only G1 is knocked out, G3 is still on (since g1 has 75% which is higher than g3's 50%). So, this fits the same promoter idea.

But what about the epistasis part? Option B says G3 is epistatic towards G1.

So, in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance should be same as G3. G3's resistance is 50%, but in the data it's 10%. So that doesn't fit. So option B is incorrect.

Option C: G2 is TF. G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. Pleiotropy is one gene affecting multiple traits. I don't see how that applies here. Also, G1 is epistatic towards G3. So in g1g3, the resistance should be same as G1, which is 75%, but in our data it's 10%. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 redundancy, G1 epistatic towards G3.

Redundancy fits the additive effect. So, the double mutant is worse than either single. But the epistasis part is conflicting.

Wait, maybe in this option, G1 is epistatic towards G3 in the sense that the mutation in G1 affects G3's contribution. So, without G1, the function of G3 doesn't matter as much, but since in g1, G3 is active, the resistance is 75%, but when both are knocked out, it's worse.

Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D. Because the data supports that G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 are redundant (since their double mutant is worse than either), and G1 is epistatic towards G3, but the wording might not fit exactly. Or perhaps the 'epistatic towards' part is a distractor.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option A. No, because G2 is the TF according to the data.

Wait, another approach: think about the double mutant combinations.

The double mutants involving G2 (g1g2 and g2g3) have 0% resistance, same as g2. So, G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3.

The double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance. So, which is worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So, this suggests that G1 and G3 are in separate, additive pathways. So, the combined loss leads to a more severe phenotype.

So, in that case, how does this fit into the options?

Looking for an option where G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in separate, additive pathways.

Which option says that?

Option D says G1 and G3 show redundancy, which is a type of additive effect. So, perhaps D is the correct answer.

But the terminology in the option is a bit confusing. So, I think the best fit is option D.


The experiment investigates the interaction of three genes (G1, G2, G3) in white lupine plants and their roles in resistance to anthracnose. The data shows resistance levels of single and double mutants compared to the wild-type control (100% resistance). The key findings are:

- **g1**: 75% resistance  
- **g2**: 0% resistance  
- **g3**: 50% resistance  
- **g1g3**: 10% resistance  
- **g2g3**: 0% resistance  
- **g1g2**: 0% resistance  

### Analysis:
1. **G2 as the Transcription Factor**:  
   The knockout of G2 results in 0% resistance, indicating that G2 is critical for resistance. This suggests G2 acts as a transcription factor upstream of other genes, as its absence abolishes resistance entirely.

2. **G1 and G3 in Separate Pathways**:  
   The double mutant **g1g3** shows 10% resistance, which is worse than either single mutant (g1: 75%, g3: 50%). This indicates that G1 and G3 contribute to resistance through separate pathways. Their combined knockout leads to an additive reduction in resistance, consistent with gene redundancy.

3. **Epistasis Between G1 and G3**:  
   The term "epistasis" implies that the mutation in one gene masks or modifies the phenotype of another. However, in this case, the double mutant **g1g3** has a phenotype worse than either single mutant, which does not fit the standard definition of epistasis. Instead, the interaction suggests that G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, and their combined loss exacerbates the phenotype.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. It claims G1 is the transcription factor, but the data shows G2 is the most critical gene, with g2 having 0% resistance.  
- **Option B**: Incorrect. While G2 is the transcription factor, the claim that G3 is epistatic to G1 is inconsistent with the data. The double mutant **g1g3** (10%) is worse than either single mutant, not the same as g3 (50%).  
- **Option C**: Incorrect. It claims G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, but there is no evidence that these genes affect multiple traits. Additionally, the claim that G1 is epistatic to G3 does not align with the data, as the double mutant **g1g3** is worse than either single mutant.  
- **Option D**: Correct. G2 is identified as the transcription factor, and the data supports that G1 and G3 are redundant (their combined knockout results in a worse phenotype than either single mutant). While the term "epistatic towards" is used, it may refer to the upstream regulation by G2 rather than direct epistasis between G1 and G3.

### Conclusion:
The data supports that G2 is the transcription factor, G1 and G3 are redundant genes contributing to resistance through separate pathways, and their combined knockout results in a more severe phenotype. This aligns with **Option D**.

Answer: D
