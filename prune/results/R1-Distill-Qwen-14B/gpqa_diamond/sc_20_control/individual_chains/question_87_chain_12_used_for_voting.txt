Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.

The question says I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms in total. Wait, di-substituted aromatic ring—so it's like benzene with two substituents. The FTIR shows peaks for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. So, the compound must have both a carbonyl (like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc.) and a halogen attached directly to the aromatic ring.

Hmm, the molecular formula isn't given, but the structure must have 8 carbons in total. The ring is 6-membered, so two substituents account for 2 carbons. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, no. Because the ring itself is 6 carbons, so the substituents must make up the remaining 2 carbons. Or maybe more because substituents can have more carbons.

Wait, the total is 8 carbons. So the ring is 6, so substituents add 2? So each substituent is a single carbon? Or maybe one substituent has two carbons. Let's think.

A carbonyl group—like maybe a ketone is a carbonyl, but that's just one substituent. Alternatively, maybe an aldehyde group, which is CHO. Wait, a carbonyl could be part of a substituent like an acetyl group (COCH3), which would add two carbons (the CO is connected to the ring, and the CH3 is part of the substituent). Wait, but the total carbons matter.

Wait, total carbons: 6 from the ring. So substituents must account for 2. So each substituent is one carbon? Or perhaps one substituent is two carbons and the other is none. No, because it's di-substituted, so two substituents.

Let me think about possible structures with a carbonyl and a halogen on the ring.

Wait, maybe the substituents are a carbonyl group (like a ketone) and a halogen. But wait, a carbonyl group would be something like a ketone, which is a C=O. But for a substituent, that would be a single carbon attached to the ring with a carbonyl. So like benzaldehyde has a CHO group attached; but that's a substituent with one carbon (the aldehyde). Alternatively, maybe a ketone like acetophenone, which is a phenyl group attached to a ketone—so the substituent is a carbonyl (CO) connected to a methyl group. So the substituent for acetophenone is a COCH3 group, which is two carbons (the CO is attached to the ring, and CH3 is the other carbon). So in that case, the substituent is two carbons.

Wait, but the problem says the compound has 8 carbons in total. So if the ring is 6 carbons, and each substituent is one carbon (because two substituents would add 2 carbons), then that makes 6 + 2 = 8. So each substituent must be one carbon. But wait, a carbonyl group like CHO is one substituent (with one carbon), and the halogen is another substituent (which has zero carbons). Because the halogen is just attached as a substituent without any carbons. So the substituents would be -X (like Cl) and -CO-R? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, let me count. If the substituents are one carbonyl group (like CHO, which is one carbon) and a halogen (like Cl, which is zero carbons), then the total carbons would be 6 (ring) + 1 (CHO) = 7. But the problem says 8 carbons. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are a carbonyl group with two carbons (like COCH2CH3), but that would add 3 carbons (COCH2CH3 is three carbons: C=O, CH2, CH3). Wait, no: the substituent is attached via the carbonyl carbon. So, for example, if the substituent is an acetyl group (COCH3), that's two carbons (CO plus CH3). So substituents would be an acetyl and a halogen. So 6 (ring) + 2 (acetyl) + 0 (halogen) = 8? No, 6 + 2 + 0 is 8? Wait, 6 + 2 is 8. Oh wait, no. Because the substituents are two in number. Wait, the acetyl is one substituent, and the halogen is another. So the acetyl contributes two carbons (COCH3), and the halogen contributes zero. So the total is 6 + 2 + 0 = 8. So that works.

So the structure would be a benzene ring with an acetyl group and a halogen substituent. Let's think about the structure. For example, 4-chloroacetophenone would be a benzene ring with a Cl and a COCH3 group attached. So in that case, the substituents are Cl and COCH3.

Wait, but wait, the question says it's di-substituted, so two substituents on the ring.

So the IR shows a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which would be around 1700 cm-1, and an aromatic-halogen bond. Halogens attached to benzene (like Cl) have characteristic stretches in IR, usually around 600-800 cm-1 (C-Cl stretch).

So the molecule is an aromatic ring with two substituents: one is a carbonyl-containing group (like acetyl), and the other is a halogen (like Cl or Br).

Now, the question is about the 1H NMR spectrum.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)

So a singlet at 9.9 ppm is probably an aldehyde proton. Because aldehydes are deshielded and appear around 9-10 ppm as singlets. But wait, in acetophenone, the carbonyl is a ketone, so no aldehyde proton. So if we have an aldehyde group, like benzaldehyde with a Cl substituent, then the spectrum would have an aldehyde proton. But the IR would also have a strong carbonyl, which would be consistent.

Wait, but the substituent would be a Cl and a CHO group. Then the total carbons would be 6 (ring) + 1 (CHO) + 0 (Cl) = 7. But the problem says 8 carbons. So that doesn't fit. So maybe the substituent is a ketone, but also another group.

Alternatively, could the substituent be an ester group? For example, OCO-R, but that would add more carbons. Wait, but the total carbons are 8. So let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are a methoxyl group (OCH3) and a carbonyl group. But wait, that would require more carbons.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a nitro group and a carbonyl group. But that would not add many carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an acetyl group (COCH3) and a halogen. So that's 6 + 2 (COCH3) =8.

So, in that case, the structure is benzene with Cl and COCH3 groups. So, for NMR, the COCH3 would be a singlet at around 2.6 ppm, but looking at the options, the protons might be more complex.

Wait, the NMR data in the options: let's look.

Option A: 9.9 ppm is a singlet, 1H. That would be an aldehyde, but earlier calculation suggests it can't be because of the carb count. So maybe that's not the case.

Option C: 7.8 (d), 7.6 (d), 2.3 (s, 3H). The 2.3 is likely a methyl group attached to a carbonyl, like in acetophenone. The doublets at 7.8 and 7.6 suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring with two substituents. So the aromatic protons would be as two doublets. Because in para substitution, the protons are equivalent in two pairs.

Wait, but if the ring is di-substituted and the substituents are in para positions, then the aromatic protons would be in a pattern of two doublets. So if substituents are para, the structure would have two substituents opposite each other. So for example, para-substituted with Cl and COCH3.

So option C's NMR: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), and 2.3 (3H, s). The 2.3 is likely the CH3 of the COCH3 group. The aromatic protons would be two doublets because the substituents are para. So in that case, the two substituents are in para positions, leading to a para-disubstituted aromatic ring.

So that would fit.

Another option: option A has a singlet at 9.9 ppm, which would be an aldehyde proton. But that would require a substituent with CHO, which is one carbon. So the total carbons would be 6 +1 (CHO) + 0 (Cl) =7, which doesn't match the 8 carbon total. So option A might not fit.

Let me check the other options.

Option B: 4.8 (d), 4.6 (d), 1.3 (s,3H). Those are likely for something like an ether or a geminal di-substitution. But I don't see how that would fit with a carbonyl and a halogen. Maybe if the substituent is an OCH2CH2O group or something, but I'm not sure. Not sure why this would be the case.

Option D: 6.9 (s,1H), 4.8 (d), 4.6 (d), 1.3 (s,2H). The singlet at 6.9 could be an aromatic proton but if it's a singlet, maybe it's a meta substitution. Wait, but di-substituted benzene with substituents in meta positions would have two sets of protons, but maybe one set as a singlet. Not sure, but the other peaks don't seem to fit a carbonyl group. The 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are more like OCH2 groups, perhaps in an epoxide or something else. Not sure.

So back to option C. The structure would be a benzene ring with a Cl and a COCH3 group in para positions. So the aromatic protons would be in two sets of doublets, with each set integrating to 2H. The COCH3 group would give a singlet at around 2.3 ppm for the three H.

So the NMR would have peaks at 7.8 (d), 7.6 (d), and 2.3 (s). Looking at option C, that's exactly what it has. So option C is a possibility.

Wait, but let me think again. If the substituents are para, then the aromatic Hs would be two doublets. For example, in para-substituted benzene, the two substituents are opposite each other, leading to two sets of equivalent protons. So the protons in the ortho and para positions relative to each substituent would be equivalent. Wait, no. Wait, the substituents are para, so the ring has two substituents across from each other. The protons adjacent to substituents (ortho) would be split into doublets due to coupling with each other.

Wait, let's imagine the ring has substituents at positions 1 and 3 (but no, 1 and 4 would be para). Wait, substituents in positions 1 and 4. Then, positions 2 and 6 would have Hs in one set, and positions 3 and 5 would have another set. Wait, no, in para substitution, the substituents are at positions 1 and 4. So the ring would have Hs at 2,3,5,6. The Hs at 2 and 6 are ortho to substituent 1 and meta to substituent 4. The Hs at 3 and 5 are meta to substituent 1 and ortho to substituent 4. So each of these pairs may be equivalent, leading to two doublets. Because each pair would couple with each other, giving a doublet.

So that fits option C, where the aromatic peaks are 7.8 (d) and 7.6 (d), each integrating to 2H. The 7.8 would be one set and 7.6 the other.

Alternatively, the substituents could be meta to each other. But in that case, the splitting would be more complex, perhaps leading to a triplet or a more complicated pattern, depending on the substituents.

So, putting this together, option C seems correct.

Wait, but what about the carb count? The substituent is COCH3, which is two carbons (the CO is part of the substituent attached to the ring, and the CH3 is part of the substituent). So the ring has 6, substituents add 2 carbons (COCH3 and Cl). So 6 + 2 =8. Correct.

Other options don't fit. For example, option A includes an aldehyde proton, which would mean a substituent of CHO (1C), plus another substituent (like Cl), but that's only 7 C. So it doesn't fit the total of 8.

So the correct NMR is option C.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The IR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. This suggests the compound has a benzene ring with two substituents: one containing a carbonyl group and the other a halogen (e.g., Cl). The total carbon count is 8, so the ring (6 carbons) plus two substituents must account for the remaining 2 carbons. This implies one substituent is a halogen (0 carbons) and the other is a carbonyl-containing group like an acetyl group (COCH₃, 2 carbons).

Analyzing the NMR options:

- **Option A**: A singlet at 9.9 ppm suggests an aldehyde proton. However, an aldehyde group (CHO) would only add 1 carbon, making the total carbon count 7 (6 from the ring + 1 from CHO), which does not match the required 8 carbons. Thus, this option is incorrect.

- **Option B**: Peaks at 4.8 ppm (d) and 4.6 ppm (d) suggest protons on adjacent carbons, possibly from an ether or similar group. However, this does not align with the presence of a carbonyl group and a halogen. This option is unlikely.

- **Option C**: Peaks at 7.8 ppm (d) and 7.6 ppm (d) indicate two sets of aromatic protons, consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring. The singlet at 2.3 ppm corresponds to the methyl group of an acetyl substituent (COCH₃). This matches the expected structure of a benzene ring with a halogen and a COCH₃ group in para positions, giving a total of 8 carbons. This option is correct.

- **Option D**: A singlet at 6.9 ppm suggests an aromatic proton, but the peaks at 4.8 ppm (d), 4.6 ppm (d), and 1.3 ppm (s) do not align with the presence of a carbonyl group and a halogen. This option is incorrect.

Thus, the correct NMR data corresponds to **Option C**, which matches the structure of a para-substituted benzene ring with a halogen and a COCH₃ group.

Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.

Let me think about possible structures with a carbonyl and a halogen on the ring.

Wait, maybe the substituents are a carbonyl group (like a ketone) and a halogen. But wait, a carbonyl group would be something like a ketone, which is a C=O. But for a substituent, that would be a single carbon attached to the ring with a carbonyl. So like benzaldehyde has a CHO group attached; but that's a substituent with one carbon (the aldehyde). Alternatively, maybe a ketone like acetophenone, which is a phenyl group attached to a ketone—so the substituent is a carbonyl (CO) connected to a methyl group. So the substituent for acetophenone is a COCH3 group, which is two carbons (the CO is attached to the ring, and CH3 is the other carbon). So in that case, the substituent is two carbons.

Wait, but the problem says the compound has 8 carbons in total. So if the ring is 6 carbons, and each substituent is one carbon (because two substituents would add 2 carbons), then that makes 6 + 2 = 8. So each substituent must be one carbon. But wait, a carbonyl group like CHO is one substituent (with one carbon), and the halogen is another substituent (which has zero carbons). Because the halogen is just attached as a substituent without any carbons. So the substituents would be -X (like Cl) and -CO-R? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, let me count. If the substituents are one carbonyl group (like CHO, which is one carbon) and a halogen (like Cl, which is zero carbons), then the total carbons would be 6 (ring) + 1 (CHO) = 7. But the problem says 8 carbons. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are a carbonyl group with two carbons (like COCH2CH3), but that would add 3 carbons (COCH2CH3 is three carbons: C=O, CH2, CH3). Wait, no: the substituent is attached via the carbonyl carbon. So, for example, if the substituent is an acetyl group (COCH3), that's two carbons (CO plus CH3). So substituents would be an acetyl and a halogen. So 6 (ring) + 2 (acetyl) + 0 (halogen) = 8? No, 6 + 2 + 0 is 8? Wait, 6 + 2 is 8. Oh wait, no. Because the substituents are two in number. Wait, the acetyl is one substituent, and the halogen is another. So the acetyl contributes two carbons (COCH3), and the halogen contributes zero. So the total is 6 + 2 + 0 = 8. So that works.

So the structure would be a benzene ring with an acetyl group and a halogen substituent. Let's think about the structure. For example, 4-chloroacetophenone would be a benzene ring with a Cl and a COCH3 group attached. So in that case, the substituents are Cl and COCH3.

Wait, but wait, the question says it's di-substituted, so two substituents on the ring.

So the IR shows a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which would be around 1700 cm-1, and an aromatic-halogen bond. Halogens attached to benzene (like Cl) have characteristic stretches in IR, usually around 600-800 cm-1 (C-Cl stretch).

So the molecule is an aromatic ring with two substituents: one is a carbonyl-containing group (like acetyl), and the other is a halogen (like Cl or Br).

Now, the question is about the 1H NMR spectrum.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)

So a singlet at 9.9 ppm is probably an aldehyde proton. Because aldehydes are deshielded and appear around 9-10 ppm as singlets. But wait, in acetophenone, the carbonyl is a ketone, so no aldehyde proton. So if we have an aldehyde group, like benzaldehyde with a Cl substituent, then the spectrum would have an aldehyde proton. But the IR would also have a strong carbonyl, which would be consistent.

Wait, but the substituent would be a Cl and a CHO group. Then the total carbons would be 6 (ring) + 1 (CHO) + 0 (Cl) = 7. But the problem says 8 carbons. So that doesn't fit. So maybe the substituent is a ketone, but also another group.

Alternatively, could the substituent be an ester group? For example, OCO-R, but that would add more carbons. Wait, but the total carbons are 8. So let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are a methoxyl group (OCH3) and a carbonyl group. But wait, that would require more carbons.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a nitro group and a carbonyl group. But that would not add many carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an acetyl group (COCH3) and a halogen. So that's 6 + 2 (COCH3) =8.

So, in that case, the structure is benzene with Cl and COCH3 groups. So, for NMR, the COCH3 would be a singlet at around 2.6 ppm, but looking at the options, the protons might be more complex.

Wait, the NMR data in the options: let's look.

Option A: 9.9 ppm is a singlet, 1H. That would be an aldehyde, but earlier calculation suggests it can't be because of the carb count. So maybe that's not the case.

Option C: 7.8 (d), 7.6 (d), 2.3 (s, 3H). The 2.3 is likely a methyl group attached to a carbonyl, like in acetophenone. The doublets at 7.8 and 7.6 suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring with two substituents. So the aromatic protons would be as two doublets. Because in para substitution, the protons are equivalent in two pairs.

Wait, but if the ring is di-substituted and the substituents are in para positions, then the aromatic protons would be in a pattern of two doublets. So if substituents are para, the structure would have two substituents opposite each other. So for example, para-substituted with Cl and COCH3.

So option C's NMR: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), and 2.3 (3H, s). The 2.3 is likely the CH3 of the COCH3 group. The aromatic protons would be two doublets because the substituents are para. So in that case, the two substituents are in para positions, leading to a para-disubstituted aromatic ring.

So that would fit.

Another option: option A has a singlet at 9.9 ppm, which would be an aldehyde proton. But that would require a substituent with CHO, which is one carbon. So the total carbons would be 6 +1 (CHO) + 0 (Cl) =7, which doesn't match the 8 carbon total. So option A might not fit.

Let me check the other options.

Option B: 4.8 (d), 4.6 (d), 1.3 (s,3H). Those are likely for something like an ether or a geminal di-substitution. But I don't see how that would fit with a carbonyl and a halogen. Maybe if the substituent is an OCH2CH2O group or something, but I'm not sure. Not sure why this would be the case.

Option D: 6.9 (s,1H), 4.8 (d), 4.6 (d), 1.3 (s,2H). The singlet at 6.9 could be an aromatic proton but if it's a singlet, maybe it's a meta substitution. Wait, but di-substituted benzene with substituents in meta positions would have two sets of protons, but maybe one set as a singlet. Not sure, but the other peaks don't seem to fit a carbonyl group. The 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are more like OCH2 groups, perhaps in an epoxide or something else. Not sure.

So back to option C. The structure would be a benzene ring with a Cl and a COCH3 group in para positions. So the aromatic protons would be in two sets of doublets, with each set integrating to 2H. The COCH3 group would give a singlet at around 2.3 ppm for the three H.

So the NMR would have peaks at 7.8 (d), 7.6 (d), and 2.3 (s). Looking at option C, that's exactly what it has. So option C is a possibility.

Wait, but let me think again. If the substituents are para, then the aromatic Hs would be two doublets. For example, in para-substituted benzene, the two substituents are opposite each other, leading to two sets of equivalent protons. So the protons in the ortho and para positions relative to each substituent would be equivalent. Wait, no. Wait, the substituents are para, so the ring has two substituents across from each other. The protons adjacent to substituents (ortho) would be split into doublets due to coupling with each other.

Wait, let's imagine the ring has substituents at positions 1 and 3 (but no, 1 and 4 would be para). Wait, substituents in positions 1 and 4. Then, positions 2 and 6 would have Hs in one set, and positions 3 and 5 would have another set. Wait, no, in para substitution, the substituents are at positions 1 and 4. So the ring would have Hs at 2,3,5,6. The Hs at 2 and 6 are ortho to substituent 1 and meta to substituent 4. The Hs at 3 and 5 are meta to substituent 1 and ortho to substituent 4. So each of these pairs may be equivalent, leading to two doublets. Because each pair would couple with each other, giving a doublet.

So that fits option C, where the aromatic peaks are 7.8 (d) and 7.6 (d), each integrating to 2H. The 7.8 would be one set and 7.6 the other.

Alternatively, the substituents could be meta to each other. But in that case, the splitting would be more complex, perhaps leading to a triplet or a more complicated pattern, depending on the substituents.

So, putting this together, option C seems correct.

Wait, but what about the carb count? The substituent is COCH3, which is two carbons (the CO is part of the substituent attached to the ring, and the CH3 is part of the substituent). So the ring has 6, substituents add 2 carbons (COCH3 and Cl). So 6 + 2 =8. Correct.

Other options don't fit. For example, option A includes an aldehyde proton, which would mean a substituent of CHO (1C), plus another substituent (like Cl), but that's only 7 C. So it doesn't fit the total of 8.

So the correct NMR is option C.


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The IR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. This suggests the compound has a benzene ring with two substituents: one containing a carbonyl group and the other a halogen (e.g., Cl). The total carbon count is 8, so the ring (6 carbons) plus two substituents must account for the remaining 2 carbons. This implies one substituent is a halogen (0 carbons) and the other is a carbonyl-containing group like an acetyl group (COCH₃, 2 carbons).

Analyzing the NMR options:

- **Option A**: A singlet at 9.9 ppm suggests an aldehyde proton. However, an aldehyde group (CHO) would only add 1 carbon, making the total carbon count 7 (6 from the ring + 1 from CHO), which does not match the required 8 carbons. Thus, this option is incorrect.

- **Option B**: Peaks at 4.8 ppm (d) and 4.6 ppm (d) suggest protons on adjacent carbons, possibly from an ether or similar group. However, this does not align with the presence of a carbonyl group and a halogen. This option is unlikely.

- **Option C**: Peaks at 7.8 ppm (d) and 7.6 ppm (d) indicate two sets of aromatic protons, consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring. The singlet at 2.3 ppm corresponds to the methyl group of an acetyl substituent (COCH₃). This matches the expected structure of a benzene ring with a halogen and a COCH₃ group in para positions, giving a total of 8 carbons. This option is correct.

- **Option D**: A singlet at 6.9 ppm suggests an aromatic proton, but the peaks at 4.8 ppm (d), 4.6 ppm (d), and 1.3 ppm (s) do not align with the presence of a carbonyl group and a halogen. This option is incorrect.

Thus, the correct NMR data corresponds to **Option C**, which matches the structure of a para-substituted benzene ring with a halogen and a COCH₃ group.

Answer: C
