Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about paramagnetic coupling and the hydrogen atom's transition energy. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The question is comparing the paramagnetic coupling term, which I think is the energy due to the magnetic interaction in an atom, with the transition energy ΔE of a hydrogen atom. The transition given has a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers, which I remember is the Balmer series, specifically the H-alpha line. So that transition is from n=2 to n=3 or something like that. Wait, no, wait: Balmer-alpha is n=3 to n=2, right? Because it's the first transition in the Balmer series, which starts at n=3. So the energy difference ΔE is related to that transition.

The magnetic field B is 1 Tesla and is along the Oz axis. The orbital magnetic quantum number m is small. I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, but I think m can only take values from -l to +l, where l is the azimuthal quantum number. Since m is small, perhaps l is small too, like in hydrogen, l=0,1,2... for the s, p, d orbitals, etc. So maybe m is 0 or ±1 or something.

The paramagnetic coupling term is probably the Zeeman term. The Zeeman effect is the splitting of spectral lines when a magnetic field is applied. The energy shift due to the magnetic field is given by the Zeeman Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian for the Zeeman effect is H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment.

For orbital magnetic moment, μ = -g_l * μ_B * l, where g_l is the Landé g-factor for orbital angular momentum. The value of g_l is approximately 1 for electrons. Wait, no, the Landé g-factor for orbital is actually about 1 for the orbital part, but the actual magnetic moment for electrons is a bit more complex because it includes spin as well. Oh wait, but paramagnetic coupling usually refers to the orbital contribution, I think. Or maybe in this context, since m is the orbital quantum number, it's about the orbital contribution.

Wait, no. Hmm. Paramagnetic coupling can refer to the interaction of the magnetic moments of electrons with an external magnetic field. So the term would be the Zeeman term, which is proportional to the magnetic quantum number m and the magnetic field B.

The energy shift due to the Zeeman effect is given by ΔE_Zeeman = μ_B * m * B, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton. The Bohr magneton is approximately 9.274×10^-24 J/T.

Wait, wait, but what's the formula exactly? Oh right, the energy shift is E = -μ·B. The magnetic moment μ is given by μ = g * μ_B * m. For orbital angular momentum, g=1. So E = - μ_B * m * B.

But wait, in the question, the paramagnetic coupling term is being compared to the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom. So I need to calculate both terms and compare them.

First, let's compute ΔE. The energy levels of hydrogen are given by E_n = - (μ_B * e^2) / (8ε_0 h_bar^2) * (1/n^2), but maybe it's easier to use the Rydberg formula to find the energy difference between two levels.

The Rydberg formula is 1/λ = R_H (1/n1² - 1/n2²), where R_H is the Rydberg constant, approximately 1.097×10^4 m^-1. Given λ=0.4861 μm, which is 486.1 nm, so 486.1 × 10^-9 m.

So 1/λ ≈ 1/(4.861e-7 m) ≈ 2.057e6 m^-1.

Wait, more accurately: 1/(486.1e-9 m) = 1/(4.861e-7 m) = approx 2057.3e3 m^-1, which is about 2.057e6 m^-1.

The Rydberg formula gives 1/λ = R_H (1/n1² - 1/n2²). For the Balmer series, transitions are from higher energy levels to n=2. So in this case, for the H-alpha line, the transition is from n=3 to n=2.

So 1/λ = R_H (1/2² - 1/3²) = R_H (1/4 - 1/9) = R_H (5/36) ≈ R_H * 0.1389.

Let me compute that: R_H is about 1.097e4 m^-1. So 1.097e4 * 0.1389 ≈ 1.097e4 * 0.1389 ≈ 1553 m^-1. Wait, but wait, that's not matching with 2.057e6 m^-1. Hmm, that can't be right. Oh wait, I think I messed up the calculation.

Wait, 1/λ is 2.057e6 m^-1, which is much larger than R_H (1.097e4 m^-1). So perhaps I did the inverse. Let me think again.

Wait, the Rydberg formula gives 1/λ = R_H (1/n1² - 1/n2²). For the H-alpha line, n2=2 and n1=3. So 1/λ = R_H (1/4 - 1/9) = R_H * (5/36).

So 1/λ = (1.097e4 m^-1) * (5/36) ≈ 1.097e4 * 0.1389 ≈ 1553 m^-1.

Wait, but 1/λ is about 2e6 m^-1, so this can't be. So perhaps I'm calculating the wrong way. Wait, no, the H-alpha line is at about 656 nm, but wait no, the question says λ=0.4861 μm, which is 486 nm, which is the H-alpha line. Wait, no, wait: I think I'm getting confused. H-alpha is the first line in the Balmer series, which occurs at about 656 nm (red). The 486 nm line is the H-beta line, which is a higher transition. Let me check.

Wait, Balmer alpha is n=3 → n=2, which is about 656 nm (red). Balmer beta is n=4 → n=2, which is about 486 nm (blue-green). So yes, the transition is H-beta, n=4 to n=2.

So for this transition, n1=2, n2=4.

So 1/λ = R_H (1/2² - 1/4²) = R_H (1/4 - 1/16) = R_H (3/16).

So 1/λ = R_H * (3/16) = 1.097e4 m^-1 * (0.1875) ≈ 2057 m^-1.

Wait, but 1/λ is 1/(0.4861e-6 m) = approx 2.057e6 m^-1. Wait, that's a big discrepancy. Oh wait, no, wait. The wavelength is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1 nm. So 486.1e-9 meters. So 1/λ ≈ 1/(4.861e-7 m) ≈ 2.057e6 m^-1.

Wait, but according to the Rydberg formula, 1/λ should be R_H * (3/16) = 1.097e4 * 0.1875 ≈ 2057 m^-1. But wait, that's way smaller than 2e6 m^-1. So something's wrong here. Oh wait, no, wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the formula.

Wait the Rydberg formula for hydrogen is 1/λ = R_H (1/n_1^2 - 1/n_2^2). For the Balmer series, n_1=2. So if the transition is from n_2 to n_1=2, then:

n_2 can be 3,4,5,...

For H-alpha: n_2=3 → n_1=2: 1/λ = R_H (1/4 - 1/9) = R_H (5/36) ≈ 1553 m^-1 → λ≈644 nm, which is about right.

But the given λ is 486 nm, which is Balmer beta, n_2=4 → n_1=2.

So 1/λ = R_H (1/4 - 1/16) = R_H (3/16) ≈ 2057 m^-1 → λ ≈ 486 nm. So that's correct.

So 1/λ = R_H (3/16) → 2.057e6 m^-1 = 1.097e4 * (3/16) → Wait, that's not possible because 1.097e4 is about 10,000, and (3/16) is about 0.1875, so 10,000 * 0.1875 is 1875, but 2e6 is much larger. Wait, I'm confused. Oh wait, wait, 1/lambda is 2.057e6 m^-1, which is much bigger than 1.097e4 m^-1. So that can't be. Then I must have made a mistake.

Wait, no. Wait the Rydberg formula for hydrogen is 1/λ = R_H (1/(n_1)^2 - 1/(n_2)^2) where n_2 > n_1. So for H-alpha, n_2=3, n_1=2. So 1/λ = R_H (1/4 - 1/9) = R_H *5/(36) ≈ (1.097e4) * 0.1389 ≈ 1553 m^-1 → λ ≈ 644 nm.

But our given λ is 486 nm, which would be 1/λ ≈ 2058 m^-1.

So using the Rydberg formula:

2058 m^-1 = 1.097e4 * (1/4 - 1/(n_2)^2).

Let me solve for n_2.

So (1/4 - 1/(n_2)^2) = 2058 / 1.097e4 ≈ 0.1875.

So 1/(n_2)^2 = 1/4 - 0.1875 = 0.25 - 0.1875 = 0.0625.

So 1/(n_2)^2 = 0.0625 → (n_2)^2 = 1/0.0625 = 16 → n_2=4.

Ah, right, so n_2=4 and n_1=2. So the transition is n=4 → n=2, which gives 486 nm. Got it.

Now, the energy difference ΔE is given by the difference between the energy levels E_2 and E_4.

The energy levels for hydrogen are E_n = -13.6 eV / n^2. So E_2 = -13.6 / 4 = -3.4 eV. E_4 = -13.6 / 16 = -0.85 eV.

So ΔE = E_2 - E_4 = (-3.4) - (-0.85) = -2.55 eV. But since energy differences are absolute in this context, I'll take the magnitude: 2.55 eV.

Wait, but wait. The energy difference for the transition is E_upper - E_lower. Since the electron is moving from higher n to lower n, the energy emitted is positive. So ΔE = E_4 - E_2 = (-0.85) - (-3.4) = 2.55 eV.

Wait, no, wait: when an electron transitions from a higher energy level (n=4) to a lower one (n=2), it emits a photon with energy ΔE = E_upper - E_lower.

Wait no, E_n is negative, and E_2 is more negative than E_4. So E_2 is lower than E_4. So the energy difference is E_4 - E_2 = (-0.85) - (-3.4) = 2.55 eV. So the photon has energy 2.55 eV.

Alternatively, we can compute ΔE using the Rydberg formula in terms of energy. The Rydberg energy is about 13.6 eV.

The Rydberg formula can also be written for energy E as:

E = hc R_H (1/n_1^2 - 1/n_2^2)

But wait, it's more straightforward to use the energy levels I mentioned earlier.

So ΔE is approximately 2.55 eV.

Now, the paramagnetic coupling term, which is the Zeeman term. As I thought earlier, the Zeeman energy shift is given by ΔE_Zeeman = μ_B * m * B.

Wait, but m is the orbital magnetic quantum number. But in hydrogen, the ground state has l=0, so m=0. But when the electron is in an excited state, l can be higher.

Wait, the problem states that m has small values. So perhaps m is small, say m=1 or 0.

But wait, the orbital magnetic quantum number m can be from -l to +l. So for a state with orbital angular momentum l=1 (p orbital), m can be -1, 0, +1.

Hmm, but wait, the paramagnetic coupling term is the energy shift due to the magnetic field. So the expectation value of the Hamiltonian term would be <H> = μ_B * m * B.

But wait, the problem is about the Hydrogen atom. So in hydrogen, the orbital magnetic moment is given by <H> = μ_B * m * B.

But for the ground state (n=1, l=0), m=0, so the Zeeman shift is zero. But maybe this is for an excited state.

Wait, but the question is comparing the paramagnetic coupling term (i.e., the Zeeman term) to the transition energy ΔE, which is on the order of 2.55 eV.

So let's compute the paramagnetic term.

The Bohr magneton μ_B is approximately 9.274×10^-24 J/T.

Given B = 1 T, and m is small, say m=1.

So ΔE_Zeeman = μ_B * m * B = 9.274e-24 J/T * 1 * 1 T = 9.274e-24 J.

But we need this in eV to compare with ΔE.

1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So:

ΔE_Zeeman = 9.274e-24 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 5.79e-5 eV.

So about 5.8e-5 eV.

But the transition energy ΔE is 2.55 eV. So the paramagnetic term is about 5.8e-5 eV, and ΔE is 2.55 eV.

So the ratio is ΔE_Zeeman / ΔE ≈ 5.8e-5 / 2.55 ≈ 2.27e-5.

That's a very small number. So the Zeeman term is much smaller than the transition energy.

Wait, but wait. Maybe I'm missing a factor. Because the orbital magnetic quantum number m is small, perhaps m=1, but for higher l, m could be larger? Wait, no, because the question states that m is small, so maybe m=0 or 1. But in any case, even if m were 2, the term would be 1.16e-4 eV, which is still way smaller than 2.55 eV.

Alternatively, perhaps the paramagnetic term is much larger. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the wrong energy expression.

Wait, the paramagnetic coupling term is the expectation value of the Hamiltonian due to the magnetic field. So H = -γ B · L, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio. But for electrons, γ is proportional to μ_B.

Wait, maybe I should re-express the energy shift as E_Zeeman = μ_B * m * B.

Wait, but for hydrogen, the orbital contribution is small because the orbital angular momentum is small (except for higher l states), but in the ground state, l=0, so m=0. But the problem states that m is small, so perhaps m=0 or 1.

But regardless, let's recalculate:

μ_B = 9.274e-24 J/T.

E_Zeeman = μ_B * m * B.

Let's take m=1.

E_Zeeman = 9.274e-24 J.

Convert to eV: 9.274e-24 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 5.79e-5 eV.

Which is 0.0000579 eV.

ΔE is about 2.55 eV.

So E_Zeeman is much smaller than ΔE. So the paramagnetic term is negligible compared to the transition energy.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility is that I'm confusing the paramagnetic term with the spin-orbit coupling or something else. But the question says paramagnetic coupling term, which is the Zeeman effect.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the paramagnetic term is related to the spin of the electron. But the orbital and spin contributions are usually treated separately. The problem states that m is the orbital magnetic quantum number, so the paramagnetic term here refers to the orbital contribution.

So, in any case, the Zeeman term is much smaller than the transition energy.

So the paramagnetic coupling term is much less than ΔE. So ⟨H⟩, which is the Zeeman term, is much less than ΔE.

Looking at the options, option C says ⟨H⟩ ≪ ΔE.

To compare the paramagnetic coupling term (Zeeman energy shift) with the transition energy \( \Delta E \) of the hydrogen atom, we analyze the given parameters and compute the relevant energies.

### Transition Energy \( \Delta E \)
The transition corresponds to the H-alpha line in the Balmer series, where the electron transitions from \( n=3 \) to \( n=2 \). The energy levels of the hydrogen atom are given by:

\[
E_n = -\frac{13.6 \, \text{eV}}{n^2}
\]

For \( n=2 \) and \( n=3 \):
\[
E_2 = -\frac{13.6}{2^2} = -3.4 \, \text{eV}, \quad E_3 = -\frac{13.6}{3^2} = -1.51 \, \text{eV}
\]

The transition energy is:
\[
\Delta E = E_3 - E_2 = -1.51 - (-3.4) = 1.89 \, \text{eV}
\]

Thus, \( \Delta E \approx 1.89 \, \text{eV} \).

---

### Paramagnetic Coupling Term (Zeeman Energy Shift)
The paramagnetic coupling term is the Zeeman energy shift, which is given by:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{Zeeman}} = \mu_B \cdot m \cdot B
\]

Here:
- \( \mu_B \) is the Bohr magneton: \( \mu_B \approx 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \),
- \( m \) is the orbital magnetic quantum number (small, \( m \leq 1 \)),
- \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \).

For \( m = 1 \):
\[
\Delta E_{\text{Zeeman}} = (9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T}) \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \, \text{T} = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}
\]

Convert to electron volts:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{Zeeman}} = \frac{9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J/eV}} \approx 5.79 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV}
\]

Thus, \( \Delta E_{\text{Zeeman}} \approx 5.79 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV} \).

---

### Comparison
The transition energy \( \Delta E \) is approximately \( 1.89 \, \text{eV} \), while the Zeeman energy shift is approximately \( 5.79 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV} \). The ratio of the two is:

\[
\frac{\Delta E_{\text{Zeeman}}}{\Delta E} = \frac{5.79 \times 10^{-5}}{1.89} \approx 3.06 \times 10^{-5}
\]

This shows that the Zeeman term is negligible compared to the transition energy. Therefore, the paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than \( \Delta E \).

---

### Final Answer
The correct option is:

**C) \( \langle H \rangle \ll \Delta E \)**
