Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, Hamiltonian... that's the operator for the total energy of a system, right?

The given Hamiltonian is H equals epsilon times the dot product of sigma and n. So, H = ε σ · n. Oh wait, σ is the Pauli spin vector, which consists of the Pauli matrices. And n is a unit vector, so it's pointing in some arbitrary direction.

I remember that the Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices, and when you take their dot product with a vector, you're essentially summing the products of each component. So σ · n would be n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z. Each σ matrix is a 2x2 matrix, so the product of n (a vector) and σ (another vector of matrices) gives another 2x2 matrix.

Since the Hamiltonian is a 2x2 matrix, its eigenvalues should be a set of two values. Eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation, which comes from det(H - λI) = 0, where λ is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

But wait, I think there might be a shortcut here. I recall that the Pauli matrices are Hermitian, which means their eigenvalues are real. Also, each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1. But in this case, the Hamiltonian is a combination of the Pauli matrices scaled by ε and the direction vector n.

Wait, the trace of σ · n. The trace is the sum of the diagonal elements. Each σ matrix has a trace of zero. So, the trace of σ · n would be n_x * trace(σ_x) + n_y * trace(σ_y) + n_z * trace(σ_z) = 0. So the trace of H is zero, meaning the sum of eigenvalues is zero.

What about the determinant? The determinant of σ · n. I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Oh wait, for a 2x2 matrix, the determinant is (a*d - b*c) for [[a,b],[c,d]]. But for the Pauli matrices, each has a determinant of -1. Because σ_x, σ_y, σ_z each have determinant -1. So, if we have σ · n, which is a combination of these, what's the determinant?

Wait, σ · n is a matrix, but how does the determinant work when you take a linear combination? Hmm. Alternatively, I remember that for a matrix like σ · n, the square is (σ · n)^2. Let me compute that. σ · n squared would be (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z)^2. Expanding this, you get n_x^2 σ_x² + n_y^2 σ_y² + n_z^2 σ_z² + terms with cross products.

But I know that σ_i squared is the identity matrix I times 3 for i=x,y,z? Wait no, each Pauli matrix squared is I. Because σ_x² = I, same for σ_y and σ_z. So each term n_i^2 σ_i² becomes n_i^2 I. Summing, we have (n_x² + n_y² + n_z²) I. But n is a unit vector, so n_x² + n_y² + n_z² =1. So σ · n squared is I.

So (σ · n)^2 = I. That means the eigenvalues of σ · n must satisfy λ^2 = 1, so λ = ±1. Therefore, σ · n has eigenvalues +1 and -1.

Wait but the Hamiltonian is ε times that. So H = ε (σ · n), so the eigenvalues would be ε multiplied by the eigenvalues of σ · n. So the eigenvalues of H are ε * (+1) and ε * (-1), which is +ε and -ε.

Looking at the options, option B is +ε and -ε. So the answer should be option B.

Alternatively, another approach: the system's Hamiltonian is proportional to the Pauli matrices. The eigenvalues of any such spin Hamiltonian (like in the z-direction, H = ε σ_z) would be ±ε. Because the eigenvalues of σ_z are ±1.

So yeah, the eigenvalues should be ±ε. So the correct option is B.

The Hamiltonian is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \(\vec{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli spin matrices, \(\vec{n}\) is an arbitrary unit vector, and \(\varepsilon\) is a constant with the dimension of energy. The goal is to determine the eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian.

The Pauli spin matrices (\(\sigma_x\), \(\sigma_y\), \(\sigma_z\)) are Hermitian, and their eigenvalues are \(\pm 1\). The dot product \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) represents a linear combination of the Pauli matrices weighted by the components of \(\vec{n}\). Importantly, \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) is also Hermitian, and its eigenvalues are \(\pm 1\), as shown by the fact that \((\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n})^2 = \vec{n} \cdot \vec{n} = 1\), since \(\vec{n}\) is a unit vector.

The Hamiltonian \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) is proportional to \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\). Therefore, the eigenvalues of \( H \) are simply \(\varepsilon\) times the eigenvalues of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\), which are \(\pm 1\). Thus, the eigenvalues of \( H \) are \(+\varepsilon\) and \(-\varepsilon\).

Among the given options, the correct choice is:

**A)** \(+1, -1\) — Incorrect, as the eigenvalues are scaled by \(\varepsilon\).  
**B)** \(+\varepsilon, -\varepsilon\) — Correct, matches the derived eigenvalues.  
**C)** \(+\varepsilon \hbar/2, -\varepsilon \hbar/2\) — Incorrect, introduces an unnecessary factor of \(\hbar/2\).  
**D)** \(+\hbar/2, -\hbar/2\) — Incorrect, does not involve \(\varepsilon\).

Answer: B
