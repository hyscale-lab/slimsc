Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some solutions are mixed. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says we're mixing three different solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. The volumes and concentrations are given, and I need to find the enthalpy change when they're all mixed together.

Wait, enthalpy of neutralization usually involves an acid reacting with a base to form water. So the reaction would be something like acid + base → salt + water, and the enthalpy change is measured per mole of reaction, typically per mole of H+ or OH- involved.

But wait, in this case, we have two acids and one base. Oh, that complicates things. Or maybe not. Let's think: HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but wait, sulfuric acid is diprotic. The first dissociation is complete (H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-?), no, wait, actually, the first dissociation is complete, but the second is not. Wait, no, for H2SO4 in solution: the first H+ ionizes completely, making H+ and HSO4^-; the second H+ doesn't ionize completely. Or wait, maybe in concentrated solutions, but in dilute solutions, the first H+ is strong and the second is weak. Hmm, but for enthalpy calculations, maybe we can consider all H+ from H2SO4, but I'm not sure. Let me think.

Wait, but when H2SO4 reacts with a base, how does it proceed? For example, with a strong base like Ba(OH)2. Let me think about the neutralization reaction.

So, the problem is to find the enthalpy change for the reaction when mixing these three solutions. So, I need to determine the moles of H+ from the acids and the moles of OH- from the base. Then, the neutralization will occur between H+ and OH- to form water, and the excess H+ or OH- will determine if there's any leftover acid or base.

Wait, but wait. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it dissociates completely into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two moles of OH^-.

So first, I need to calculate the moles of H+ from HCl and H2SO4, and the moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2.

Let me calculate each.

HCl: 0.2 M, 500 mL. Moles = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 mol. Since HCl is a strong acid, it provides 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M, 300 mL. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol. Now, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. But wait, in the context of neutralization with a base, how many H+ ions can it contribute? The first H+ is strong, so it completely ionizes, and the second is weak. In neutralization reactions, typically the first H+ is neutralized first. But wait, when you mix an acid with a base, the H+ from the acid and the OH- from the base will react in a 1:1 ratio.

But wait, H2SO4 can donate two H+ ions, but in a neutralization reaction, each H+ would require one OH-.

So, the total H+ from H2SO4 is 2 * 0.09 = 0.18 mol? Or is it only one H+ per molecule because the second is weaker? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, in neutralization, the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So each mole of H+ reacts with a mole of OH-.

H2SO4 is a strong acid in its first dissociation: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, actually, I think the first H+ comes off completely, so H2SO4 → H+ + HSO4^- , and then the HSO4^- may or may not donate another H+. But in the presence of a base, which is a strong base with a high concentration of OH-, I think both H+ ions from H2SO4 will react. So, each mole of H2SO4 would contribute 2 moles of H+.

Wait, but wait, the second H+ is not as strong as HCl or other strong acids. So in a solution, it may not fully dissociate. But when mixed with a strong base, which will rapidly neutralize the H+ ions, maybe the second H+ will also dissociate enough to react with the OH-.

Alternatively, perhaps for the purpose of this problem, we can assume that each mole of H2SO4 provides 2 moles of H+.

Alternatively, maybe the problem considers only the first H+ as the one that contributes to the neutralization, because the second is a weak acid. Hmm, but this is a point I'm not sure about. Maybe I should proceed and see.

So, let's proceed with the assumption that H2SO4 contributes 2 moles of H+ per mole. So, 0.09 mol H2SO4 gives 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M, 200 mL. Moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 mol OH-.

Wait, wait, Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH^- per formula unit. So 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 gives 0.2 mol OH^-.

Now, let's sum up the H+ and OH-.

Total H+ from HCl and H2SO4: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

Total OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.2 mol.

So, when they mix, the H+ and OH- will react in a 1:1 ratio. The amount of H+ and OH- that will neutralize is the smaller of the two.

In this case, OH- is 0.2, and H+ is 0.28. So, all 0.2 mol of OH- will react, leaving 0.08 mol H+ unreacted.

Wait, but wait. The H+ comes from HCl and H2SO4. So the neutralization will consume 0.2 mol H+ and 0.2 mol OH-, producing 0.2 mol H2O. But then, there's 0.08 mol H+ left from the acids.

Wait, but wait, the H2SO4 might only donate one H+ each, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem is about the enthalpy of neutralization. The enthalpy change for each mole of H+ neutralized is typically about -57 kJ/mol (for strong acids and bases). But I'm not sure about the exact value here.

Wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is usually -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-) reacting. So, each H+ that reacts with OH- releases about 57 kJ of energy.

So, in this problem, the amount of H+ that reacts is 0.2 mol, because there are only 0.2 mol OH- available. The remaining 0.08 mol H+ doesn't get neutralized because there's no more OH-.

So the total enthalpy change would be 0.2 mol * 57 kJ/mol = 11.4 kJ. But wait, the options include both kcal and kJ. Wait, 57 kJ is approximately 13.64 kcal (since 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ, so 57 /4.184 ≈ 13.63). Or wait, maybe the value is given as -57 kJ per mole.

Wait, but the options are in kcal and kJ. Let me look:

Options:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

Hmm. So, if each mole of H+ contributes about -57 kJ, then 0.2 mol would give 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ. But that's not one of the options. Oh wait, option D is -16 kJ. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate using different values.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of H+ ions. Let me recheck the calculations.

HCl: 500 mL * 0.2 M = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL * 0.3 M = 0.09 mol H2SO4. Each gives 2 H+? So 0.18 mol H+.

Total H+ is 0.28 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL * 0.5 M = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So, 0.2 mol OH- will react with 0.2 mol H+. The remaining H+ is 0.08 mol.

So, the total moles reacting is 0.2.

Assuming the enthalpy per mole is -57 kJ, then 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ. But I don't see an option exactly at that. Option D is -16 kJ, which is larger. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the enthalpy per mole is different. Or maybe I'm missing something else in the problem.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the neutralization is calculated per mole of H+ from each acid and per mole of OH- from the base.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution involves considering the stoichiometry correctly.

Wait, another thing: when H2SO4 reacts with a base, maybe the neutralization happens in two steps. First, the first H+ from H2SO4 is neutralized, and then the second. But in this case, the OH- is limited, so maybe only the first H+ from H2SO4 and the H+ from HCl get neutralized.

Wait, perhaps the H+ from HCl is 0.1 mol, and the H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 mol (assuming only first H+). Then, total H+ would be 0.19, and OH- is 0.2. So OH- is in excess.

Wait, that's conflicting with earlier thinking. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Let me think again. The problem is to find the enthalpy change when all three solutions are mixed. So the acid is HCl and H2SO4, and the base is Ba(OH)2.

HCl is a strong acid, so it gives 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. The first H+ is strong, but the second is weak. So in solution, the H2SO4 → H+ + HSO4^- (completely), and HSO4^- can donate another H+ but not completely. So in the solution, the H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 mol (from first dissociation), and some more from the second, but maybe negligible for this problem.

But when a strong base like Ba(OH)2 is added, it will deprotonate all available H+ ions. So the strong base will neutralize both the H+ from HCl and the first H+ from H2SO4, and perhaps some of the second H+.

Wait, let's calculate the moles of H+ from H2SO4. The first H+ is 0.09 mol, the second is perhaps 0.09 mol, but not all of it dissociates. But in the presence of a strong base, maybe the second H+ is also neutralized.

Alternatively, perhaps in the context of this problem, we can assume that all H+ from the acids are available. So, 0.1 (HCl) + 0.18 (H2SO4) = 0.28 mol H+.

The Ba(OH)2 provides 0.2 mol OH-.

So, the OH- will neutralize 0.2 mol H+.

So, the neutralized H+ is 0.2 mol.

Thus, the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is almost the same value, but in kcal.

Wait, wait, I'm getting confused between kJ and kcal. Let me compute the value in kcal.

57 kJ is approximately 13.6 kcal (since 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ → 57 /4.184 ≈ 13.6 kcal).

So, 0.2 mol * (-13.6 kcal/mol) = -2.72 kcal. Hmm, that's option A.

Wait, but why would the calculation change based on units? No, wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ per mole, which is -13.6 kcal. So, each mole of H+ neutralized releases 57 kJ or 13.6 kcal.

So, 0.2 mol would be 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ, or 0.2 * (-13.6 kcal) = -2.72 kcal.

So, the calculation depends on which unit we use. The options have both, so which is correct?

Looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about 0.2 * 57.1 kJ (since 57.1 kJ is about 13.63 kcal). Wait, 57.1 kJ is 13.63 kcal. So 0.2 * 13.63 = 2.726 kcal. So, if the enthalpy is -57.1 kJ/mol, the change would be -11.42 kJ or -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but the options are in both kJ and kcal. So, which unit are we supposed to use?

The problem states the options as:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

So, the calculation using 57 kJ/mol (or 13.6 kcal/mol) would give either -11.4 kJ or -2.72 kcal.

But the problem asks for the enthalpy when mixing all solutions. So, the neutralized H+ is 0.2 mol. So, 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ, which would be approximately -11.4 kJ. But looking at the options, option D is -16 kJ. Hmm, that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation uses 57 kcal/mol. Wait, wait, no, that doesn't make sense because 57 kcal is way too high.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of moles.

Wait, let me recalculate the moles.

HCl: 500 mL = 0.5 L. 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL = 0.3 L. 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol H2SO4. Each gives 2 H+, so 0.18 mol H+.

Total H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL = 0.2 L. 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 mol OH-.

So, OH- is 0.2. H+ is 0.28.

So, the OH- will neutralize 0.2 mol H+, leaving 0.08 H+.

So, the neutralization reaction is 0.2 mol, which releases 0.2 * 57 kJ = 11.4 kJ, but as it's exothermic, it's -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16 kJ. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong enthalpy value. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different value, like -57.3 kJ/mol. Let me compute 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ. Which is not exactly any option, but option B is -11.42 kcal. Let me check.

Wait, the options are in both kcal and kJ. So, perhaps I should compute in terms of kcal.

Each mole of H+ neutralized releases 13.6 kcal (approx 57 kJ). So, 0.2 mol * 13.6 kcal/mol = 2.72 kcal. So, the enthalpy change is -2.72 kcal.

Which is option A.

But wait, the problem says 'the enthalpy of neutralization'. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of H+ (or OH-) reacting. So, the calculation is correct.

Therefore, the correct answer is option A, -2.72 kcal.

But wait, why is option B present? Because 0.2 mol * 57 kJ is 11.4 kJ, which is 11.4/4.184 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So, the same number but in different units.

But the options have B as -11.42 kcal, which would be 11.42 *4.184≈ 47.7 kJ. Not sure why that's an option.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: The total H+ is 0.28 mol, OH- is 0.2 mol. So, the neutralization is 0.2 mol. The enthalpy per mole is 57 kJ, so 0.2 * 57 = 11.4 kJ. So, -11.4 kJ.

But none of the options match that. The options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

Wait, option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm, but that's larger than 11.4. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of moles.

Wait, let me recheck the moles.

HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 L * 0.3 = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 H+.

Total H+ = 0.28.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L * 0.5 = 0.1 mol. Each gives 2 OH- → 0.2 mol OH-.

So, correct.

Hmm, but why is the option for 11.4 not present? Oh wait, option B is -11.42 kcal. Let me compute 11.4 kJ in kcal: 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So, option A is correct.

Alternatively, maybe the question is using a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization.

Wait, maybe I should think about the stoichiometry of the reactions. Let me write the possible reactions.

HCl + Ba(OH)2 → ?

HCl is a strong acid, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. The neutralization would be: HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + H2O.

But wait, the stoichiometry is important. But since we have multiple acids and a single base, perhaps the overall reaction is the sum of all acid-base reactions.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of H+ and OH-.

Total H+ = HCl + H2SO4.

HCl: 0.1 mol → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.09 mol → each gives 2 H+, so 0.18.

Total H+ = 0.28.

OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.2 mol.

So, 0.2 mol H+ reacts with 0.2 mol OH- → 0.2 mol H2O.

The remaining H+ is 0.08.

So, the total enthalpy change is 0.2 * 57 kJ = 11.4 kJ → which is not an option except in kcal as option A.

Wait, but the problem asks for the enthalpy of neutralization. The enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of H+ neutralized. So 0.2 mol → 0.2 * 57 kJ = 11.4 kJ. So, -11.4 kJ. But none of the options have that. Option D is -16 kJ. Maybe I have a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the H2SO4 contributes only one H+.

If H2SO4 contributes 0.09 mol H+ (only first H+), then total H+ is 0.1 + 0.09 = 0.19. OH- is 0.2. So, all H+ (0.19) neutralized, and 0.01 OH- left.

So, the neutralization is 0.19 mol. 0.19 *57 = 10.83 kJ → which is approximately 10.83 kJ. But none of the options match.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps H2SO4 contributes two H+.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is because H2SO4 in a solution of a base may not fully donate both H+.

Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so contributes two H+ per molecule. But when mixed with a base, perhaps only the first H+ is neutralized because the second is weak.

Wait, perhaps the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will first neutralize the stronger acid's H+ first, and then the weaker.

But HCl is a stronger acid than H2SO4's second H+, so HCl's H+ will be neutralized first.

So, HCl has 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4 has 0.09 mol H+ from first dissociation.

The OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.2 mol.

So, the OH- will first neutralize HCl's H+ (0.1 mol), then H2SO4's first H+ (0.09 mol), and then any remaining OH- will neutralize the second H+ from H2SO4, if any.

Wait, let's see:

Step 1: Neutralize HCl's 0.1 H+ with 0.1 OH- → remaining OH- is 0.1 mol.

Step 2: Neutralize H2SO4's first H+ (0.09 mol) with 0.09 OH- → remaining OH- is 0.01 mol.

At this point, all H+ from HCl and first H+ from H2SO4 are neutralized. Now, the remaining 0.01 OH- can react with the second H+ from H2SO4.

H2SO4 can donate a second H+ (but it's weak). So, the OH- will neutralize 0.01 H+ from H2SO4's second dissociation.

So, in total, neutralized H+ is 0.1 + 0.09 + 0.01 = 0.2 mol. So, same as before, 0.2 mol.

So, the same calculation applies: 0.2 mol * 57 kJ = 11.4 kJ → -11.4 kJ. But none of the options have that except option B in kcal.

Wait, 11.4 kJ is 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So, that's option A.

But why is option B present? Let me compute 11.42 kcal in kJ: 11.42 *4.184 ≈ 47.66 kJ. Which is way higher than our calculation. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of reaction, not per mole of H+. For example, in the case of H2SO4, perhaps the neutralization is considered per mole of H2SO4, regardless of the H+ it contributes.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization. Maybe it's -57.3 kJ per mole of H+.

Wait, 0.2 mol * 57.3 kJ = 11.46 kJ. So, approximately -11.46 kJ. Which is close to option D, which is -16.0 kJ. No, that's not matching.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the neutralization of each acid separately.

Let me think differently. Let's calculate the moles of H+ from each acid and the OH- from the base.

HCl: 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol H+ (assuming both are neutralized).

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 mol OH-.

Then, the total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So, 0.2 mol H+ neutralized.

Enthalpy change is 0.2 * 57 = 11.4 kJ → -11.4 kJ.

But option D is -16 kJ. Hmm, perhaps considering the stoichiometry in a different way.

Wait, maybe the calculation is being done per mole of H+ from each acid, but perhaps I'm missing the fact that Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and might require more H+ for neutralization.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate the total H+ and OH- and find the limiting reagent, then compute the enthalpy based on that.

But the calculation seems correct, leading to 0.2 mol H+ neutralization, so 11.4 kJ.

Wait, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the problem is expecting the answer in kcal, making option A correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of moles.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute the total H+ and OH-.

HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 M = 0.1 mol → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 mol → 0.18 H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L * 0.5 M = 0.1 mol → 0.2 OH-.

So, H+ = 0.28, OH- = 0.2. So, 0.2 mol H+ neutralized.

So, 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ. So, -11.4 kJ is not an option, but option B is -11.42 kcal.

Wait, 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal (since 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72).

So, option A is -2.72 kcal.

But why is option B there? Maybe I made a mistake in considering the number of H+.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization. Let's say it's -57.3 kJ/mol for each H+ neutralized.

So, 0.2 * 57.3 = 11.46 kJ → which is about 2.738 kcal. So, approximately -2.74 kcal, which is close to option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in kJ, but none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting the answer in kJ, but the options have D as -16 kJ, which is larger than our calculated -11.4 kJ. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the Ba(OH)2 as providing two OH- per formula unit, but when it reacts with H2SO4, which is a diprotic acid, perhaps each mole of Ba(OH)2 can neutralize two H+ from H2SO4.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reaction between Ba(OH)2 and H2SO4.

The reaction is: H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

But wait, the stoichiometry would be 1 mole of H2SO4 reacting with 1 mole of Ba(OH)2 to produce 1 mole of BaSO4 and 2 moles of H2O.

Each mole of H2SO4 provides 2 H+, each mole of Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH-.

So, the balanced equation is H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

So, this reaction uses 1 H2SO4 and 1 Ba(OH)2, producing 2 H2O. So, the H+ from H2SO4 and OH- from Ba(OH)2 react in a 2:2 (1:1) ratio.

So, in this case, let's calculate the moles.

HCl: 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.09 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.1 mol.

In the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, 1:1 mole ratio.

So, 0.09 mol H2SO4 can react with 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2 → producing 0.09 mol BaSO4 and 0.18 mol H2O.

After this reaction, the remaining Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 - 0.09 = 0.01 mol → which gives 0.02 mol OH-.

And the HCl has 0.1 mol H+.

So, after the H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 reaction, we have:

H+ from HCl: 0.1 mol.

OH- from remaining Ba(OH)2: 0.02 mol.

So, H+ and OH- will react: 0.02 mol OH- reacts with 0.02 mol H+ from HCl.

So, total H+ neutralized is 0.02 + 0.18 (from H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 reaction) = 0.2 mol.

So, again, the total neutralized H+ is 0.2 mol.

Thus, enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ. So, same as before.

But the options don't have this. So, perhaps the correct answer is option A, -2.72 kcal.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the enthalpy of neutralization per mole of acid, not per mole of H+. Hmm, but that's less likely.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the total moles of H+ and OH- but in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is done for each acid and base reaction separately.

But regardless, the calculation for the neutralization is 0.2 mol H+ neutralized, leading to 11.4 kJ or 2.72 kcal.

Thus, the correct answer must be option A: -2.72 kcal.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing the given solutions, we first determine the moles of H⁺ from the acids (HCl and H₂SO₄) and the moles of OH⁻ from the base (Ba(OH)₂). The neutralization reaction involves H⁺ and OH⁻ reacting in a 1:1 ratio to form water, and the enthalpy change is typically -57 kJ per mole of H⁺ neutralized.

### Step 1: Calculate moles of H⁺ from acids
1. **HCl**:  
   - Volume = 500 mL = 0.5 L, Molarity = 0.2 M  
   - Moles of HCl = \( 0.5 \times 0.2 = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \)  
   - Since HCl is a strong acid, it contributes 0.1 mol of H⁺.

2. **H₂SO₄**:  
   - Volume = 300 mL = 0.3 L, Molarity = 0.3 M  
   - Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \)  
   - H₂SO₄ is diprotic, and both H⁺ ions are assumed to contribute to neutralization.  
   - Total H⁺ from H₂SO₄ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).

**Total H⁺ from acids = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.**

### Step 2: Calculate moles of OH⁻ from base
- **Ba(OH)₂**:  
  - Volume = 200 mL = 0.2 L, Molarity = 0.5 M  
  - Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.2 \times 0.5 = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \)  
  - Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ dissociates into 2 OH⁻ ions.  
  - Total OH⁻ = \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

### Step 3: Determine the limiting reactant
- Total H⁺ available = 0.28 mol  
- Total OH⁻ available = 0.2 mol  
- OH⁻ is the limiting reactant, as it can neutralize only 0.2 mol of H⁺.  
- Remaining H⁺ = \( 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 \, \text{mol} \).

### Step 4: Calculate enthalpy change
- Each mole of H⁺ neutralized releases 57 kJ of energy.  
- Total enthalpy change = \( 0.2 \times (-57) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \).  
- Converting to kcal: \( 1 \, \text{kJ} = 0.239 \, \text{kcal} \), so  
  \[
  -11.4 \, \text{kJ} = -11.4 \times 0.239 = -2.72 \, \text{kcal}.
  \]

### Step 5: Analyze the options
- **Option A (-2.72 kcal)**: Matches the calculated value in kcal.  
- **Option B (-11.42 kcal)**: Incorrect, as it does not match the calculated value.  
- **Option C (-3.80 kcal)**: Incorrect, as it does not match the calculated value.  
- **Option D (-16.0 kJ)**: Incorrect, as it does not match the calculated value in kJ.

### Final Answer:
The correct enthalpy of neutralization is **-2.72 kcal**.  
**Answer: A**
