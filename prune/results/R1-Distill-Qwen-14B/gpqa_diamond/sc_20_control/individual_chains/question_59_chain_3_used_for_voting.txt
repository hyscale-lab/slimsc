Okay, I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not too confident with pH calculations involving multiple acids and bases. But let's take it step by step.

Alright, the question is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (acetic acid), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (hydrochloric acid), and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (barium hydroxide). Hmm, so it's a mix of acids and a base. I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other, so I need to find out if there's an excess of acid or base after the neutralization.

First, I think I should calculate the moles of each component. Moles are calculated by Molarity multiplied by Volume (in liters). Let me jot that down.

For CH3COOH:
Molarity is 0.1 M, volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. So moles = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles.

For HCl:
Molarity is 0.2 M, volume is 400 mL = 0.4 L. Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles.

For Ba(OH)2:
Molarity is 0.3 M, volume 300 mL = 0.3 L. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each formula unit gives two OH- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-. So the total OH- moles would be 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, I need to see what happens when these are mixed. So, the HCl and CH3COOH are acids, and Ba(OH)2 is a base. So the H+ ions from the acids will react with the OH- ions from the base.

But wait, HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely. CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it won't dissociate completely. So the H+ from CH3COOH is less than from HCl.

So first, let's think about the reaction between the H+ (from both acids) and OH- from the base.

Total H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles, since HCl is strong and fully ionized. For CH3COOH, it's 0.05 moles, but since it's weak, the actual H+ is much less. But perhaps for this problem, it's better to consider the initial H+ from both and then see if they can neutralize the OH-.

Wait, but maybe I should calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- and see which is in excess.

Wait, wait, that's the way to go. Let me proceed.

Total H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles (since each HCl gives 1 H+).
Total H+ from CH3COOH: 0.05 moles (but since it's weak, not all will dissociate; but wait, in the presence of a strong acid and a base, perhaps the weak acid's H+ is negligible in comparison. Hmm, maybe I should consider the initial moles of H+ from all sources and the OH-.

So total H+ = 0.08 (from HCl) + 0.05 (from CH3COOH) = 0.13 moles.

Wait, but wait. CH3COOH is a weak acid, so when you mix it with HCl, which is a strong acid, the H+ from HCl will suppress the dissociation of CH3COOH. So in reality, the H+ from CH3COOH is much less than 0.05 moles. So perhaps I can approximate that in this case, the H+ from CH3COOH is negligible compared to HCl's H+.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption is to consider all H+ from HCl and all OH- from Ba(OH)2, then see what's left after neutralization, and then calculate the pH based on the excess.

Wait, maybe I should proceed as follows:

1. Calculate moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles.
2. Calculate moles of H+ from CH3COOH: initial moles of CH3COOH is 0.05, but since it's weak, the H+ is less. Let me not consider it for now, perhaps it's negligible compared to the strong acid.
3. Calculate moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, the OH- will react with H+ from both HCl and CH3COOH. So first, the OH- will neutralize the H+ from HCl.

Moles of OH- = 0.18, moles of H+ (HCl) = 0.08. So the OH- can neutralize all the H+ from HCl, and have some left over.

0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH- remaining.

After that, the remaining OH- will react with the H+ from CH3COOH. But how much H+ does CH3COOH contribute?

CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it dissociates a little. Let me model that. The H+ from CH3COOH can be calculated using the dissociation equation:

CH3COOH ↔ H+ + CH3COO-

The initial moles of CH3COOH are 0.05 moles.

But wait, when you mix all these solutions, the total volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L. But in the case of neutralization, perhaps the volume doesn't matter until the end when calculating concentration.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of moles. Let me first find out how much OH- is left after neutralizing the H+ from HCl.

So, after HCl's H+ (0.08) is neutralized, 0.10 moles of OH- remain.

Now, the OH- will react with the H+ from CH3COOH. The CH3COOH is 0.05 moles. The OH- can react with H+ from CH3COOH as follows:

Each mole of OH- can neutralize one mole of H+.

So, how much H+ does CH3COOH contribute? Let's think about this. The H+ from CH3COOH is given by the dissociation, but since it's a weak acid, the H+ is small. Let me use the approximation method.

The dissociation of CH3COOH can be represented as:

Ka = [H+][CH3COO^-] / [CH3COOH]

Ka for acetic acid is about 1.8 × 10^-5. Let me remember that.

The initial concentration of CH3COOH after mixing is (0.05 moles) / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0417 M.

Wait, but when you mix with the strong acid and base, the H+ from HCl is already neutralized, and the OH- is left. So the solution will be basic, right? Because OH- is in excess.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The OH- is 0.10 moles in 1.2 L. But that would make the solution basic, so the pH would be determined by the excess OH-.

Wait, but maybe the OH- will react with the CH3COOH. Because in a basic solution, the CH3COOH would react with OH-.

Wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid, and OH- is a strong base. So they will neutralize each other. The reaction is:

CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O

So each mole of OH- can neutralize a mole of CH3COOH.

So, the moles of OH- after neutralizing HCl is 0.10. The moles of CH3COOH are 0.05.

So, OH- (0.10) will react with CH3COOH (0.05), completely neutralizing all 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, and leaving 0.05 moles of OH-.

So, after all reactions, the excess OH- is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles.

Wait, but wait. Because OH- has a higher concentration, perhaps it can neutralize all the CH3COOH. Let me see:

Moles of OH- after HCl: 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10.

Moles of CH3COOH: 0.05.

So, OH- can neutralize 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, producing 0.05 moles of acetate ions (CH3COO^-). Then, the remaining OH- is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles.

So, the total solution volume is 1.2 L (500+400+300).

The concentration of OH- is 0.05 moles / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0417 M.

Then, the pOH can be calculated as -log(0.0417).

pH would be 14 - pOH.

Wait, let me compute that.

Calculating pOH: log(0.0417) is around log(4.17e-2) ≈ 1.38 (since log(4) is about 0.60, log(4.17) ≈ 0.62, so 0.62 - 2 = 1.38? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, 0.0417 is 4.17 ×10^-2.

So log(4.17e-2) = log(4.17) + log(1e-2) → ≈ 0.62 + (-2) → -1.38.

So pOH = -log[OH-] = 1.38.

Wait, no. Wait, pOH is -log10 of the hydroxide concentration. So [OH-] is 0.0417 M.

So log(0.0417) ≈ log(4.17 ×10^-2) = log(4.17) + log(10^-2) → ≈ 0.62 + (-2) = -1.38. So pOH is the negative of that, which is 1.38.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, [OH-] is 0.0417 M. So log(0.0417) is negative. Let me compute it more accurately.

Let me think: log(4) is 0.60, log(5)=0.69897. So 4.17 is between 4 and 5. Let me compute log(4.17):

4.17 is 4.17 = 4 * (1 + 0.0425). Using log(4) = 0.60206, then log(4.17) ≈ 0.60206 + (0.0425 * 0.0434) [using derivative approximation: log(x+Δx) ≈ log x + (Δx)/(x ln 10)]. Alternatively, maybe just approximate. I think log(4.17) is approximately 0.62, so:

log(0.0417) = log(4.17e-2) = log(4.17) + log(1e-2) → 0.62 -2 = -1.38.

So pOH = -log(0.0417) = 1.38 → pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

Wait, but none of the options match 12.62? Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) 12.62

B) 1.38

C) 8.92

D) 8.68

So option A is 12.62, which would be the case if the solution is basic, with excess OH-.

But wait, did I make a mistake in the stoichiometry?

Let's go back.

After adding all the solutions, the total volume is 1200 mL.

Moles of H+ from HCl: 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08.

Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09, but each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-, so 0.18 moles.

So OH- is 0.18.

H+ from HCl is 0.08. So OH- neutralizes H+ from HCl: 0.08 H+ reacts with 0.08 OH- → neutralizes, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH-.

Now, the OH- will react with H+ from CH3COOH. But CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't release all H+.

But in the presence of OH-, which is a strong base, the CH3COOH will donate H+ until it's all neutralized or until OH- is consumed.

So, the CH3COOH has 0.05 moles (from 0.1 M * 0.5 L). So OH- (0.10) can neutralize 0.05 of CH3COOH, producing 0.05 moles of CH3COO^-.

So after this, the OH- left is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles.

So total moles of OH- in solution is 0.05.

Total volume is 1.2 L, so concentration is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.04167 M.

pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38.

pH = 14 -1.38 =12.62, which matches option A.

Wait, but wait. Did I account for all the reactions correctly? Let me think again.

HCl is a strong acid, so it's fully dissociated. So its moles of H+ are 0.08.

Ba(OH)2 is strong base, so OH- is 0.18.

So H+ from HCl (0.08) neutralizes OH- (0.08), leaving 0.10 OH-.

Then, OH- will neutralize the H+ from CH3COOH. But CH3COOH is a weak acid, so the H+ is not all present. But in solution, OH- can react with CH3COOH.

The reaction is CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So, the 0.10 moles of OH- can react with CH3COOH. There are 0.05 moles of CH3COOH. So all of the CH3COOH is neutralized, and 0.05 moles of OH- remain.

So the remaining OH- is 0.05 moles in 1.2 L → 0.0417 M. So pOH is 1.38, pH is 12.62.

Therefore, the correct answer is A) 12.62.

To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions from the given reactants and their neutralization reactions.

### Step 1: Calculate moles of H⁺ and OH⁻
- **CH₃COOH (acetic acid):**  
  Moles = \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{moles} \).  
  Since CH₃COOH is a weak acid, its contribution to H⁺ is small and will be addressed later.

- **HCl (hydrochloric acid):**  
  Moles = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{moles} \).  
  HCl is a strong acid, so it fully dissociates, contributing \( 0.08 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \).

- **Ba(OH)₂ (barium hydroxide):**  
  Moles = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{moles} \).  
  Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ produces 2 moles of OH⁻, so total moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles} \).

### Step 2: Neutralization reactions
1. **Neutralization of H⁺ (from HCl) by OH⁻:**  
   H⁺ from HCl = \( 0.08 \, \text{moles} \).  
   OH⁻ = \( 0.18 \, \text{moles} \).  
   After neutralization, \( 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{moles of OH⁻ remain} \).

2. **Neutralization of OH⁻ by CH₃COOH:**  
   CH₃COOH = \( 0.05 \, \text{moles} \).  
   OH⁻ = \( 0.10 \, \text{moles} \).  
   OH⁻ reacts with CH₃COOH in a 1:1 ratio, neutralizing all \( 0.05 \, \text{moles of CH₃COOH} \), and leaving \( 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{moles of OH⁻} \).

### Step 3: Calculate [OH⁻] and pH
- Total volume of the solution = \( 500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L} \).  
- Concentration of OH⁻ = \( \frac{0.05 \, \text{moles}}{1.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.0417 \, \text{M} \).

- **pOH:**  
  \( \text{pOH} = -\log[OH⁻] = -\log(0.0417) \approx 1.38 \).

- **pH:**  
  \( \text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62 \).

### Final Answer:
The pH of the solution is **12.62**, corresponding to option **A**.

For CH3COOH:
Molarity is 0.1 M, volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. So moles = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles.

For HCl:
Molarity is 0.2 M, volume is 400 mL = 0.4 L. Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles.

For Ba(OH)2:
Molarity is 0.3 M, volume 300 mL = 0.3 L. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each formula unit gives two OH- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-. So the total OH- moles would be 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Moles of OH- = 0.18, moles of H+ (HCl) = 0.08. So the OH- can neutralize all the H+ from HCl, and have some left over.

0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH- remaining.

After that, the remaining OH- will react with the H+ from CH3COOH. But how much H+ does CH3COOH contribute?

CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it dissociates a little. Let me model that. The H+ from CH3COOH can be calculated using the dissociation equation:

CH3COOH ↔ H+ + CH3COO-

The initial moles of CH3COOH are 0.05 moles.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of moles. Let me first find out how much OH- is left after neutralizing the H+ from HCl.

So, after HCl's H+ (0.08) is neutralized, 0.10 moles of OH- remain.

Now, the OH- will react with the H+ from CH3COOH. The CH3COOH is 0.05 moles. The OH- can react with H+ from CH3COOH as follows:

The dissociation of CH3COOH can be represented as:

Ka = [H+][CH3COO^-] / [CH3COOH]

Ka for acetic acid is about 1.8 × 10^-5. Let me remember that.

The initial concentration of CH3COOH after mixing is (0.05 moles) / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0417 M.

Wait, but when you mix with the strong acid and base, the H+ from HCl is already neutralized, and the OH- is left. So the solution will be basic, right? Because OH- is in excess.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The OH- is 0.10 moles in 1.2 L. But that would make the solution basic, so the pH would be determined by the excess OH-.

Wait, but maybe the OH- will react with the CH3COOH. Because in a basic solution, the CH3COOH would react with OH-.

Wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid, and OH- is a strong base. So they will neutralize each other. The reaction is:

CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O

So each mole of OH- can neutralize a mole of CH3COOH.

So, the moles of OH- after neutralizing HCl is 0.10. The moles of CH3COOH are 0.05.

So, OH- (0.10) will react with CH3COOH (0.05), completely neutralizing all 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, and leaving 0.05 moles of OH-.

So, after all reactions, the excess OH- is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles.

Wait, but wait. Because OH- has a higher concentration, perhaps it can neutralize all the CH3COOH. Let me see:

Moles of OH- after HCl: 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10.

Moles of CH3COOH: 0.05.

So, OH- can neutralize 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, producing 0.05 moles of acetate ions (CH3COO^-). Then, the remaining OH- is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles.

So, the total solution volume is 1.2 L (500+400+300).

The concentration of OH- is 0.05 moles / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0417 M.

Then, the pOH can be calculated as -log(0.0417).

pH would be 14 - pOH.

Wait, let me compute that.

Calculating pOH: log(0.0417) is around log(4.17e-2) ≈ 1.38 (since log(4) is about 0.60, log(4.17) ≈ 0.62, so 0.62 - 2 = 1.38? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, 0.0417 is 4.17 ×10^-2.

So log(4.17e-2) = log(4.17) + log(1e-2) → ≈ 0.62 + (-2) → -1.38.

So pOH = -log[OH-] = 1.38.

Wait, no. Wait, pOH is -log10 of the hydroxide concentration. So [OH-] is 0.0417 M.

So log(0.0417) ≈ log(4.17 ×10^-2) = log(4.17) + log(10^-2) → ≈ 0.62 + (-2) = -1.38. So pOH is the negative of that, which is 1.38.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, [OH-] is 0.0417 M. So log(0.0417) is negative. Let me compute it more accurately.

Let me think: log(4) is 0.60, log(5)=0.69897. So 4.17 is between 4 and 5. Let me compute log(4.17):

4.17 is 4.17 = 4 * (1 + 0.0425). Using log(4) = 0.60206, then log(4.17) ≈ 0.60206 + (0.0425 * 0.0434) [using derivative approximation: log(x+Δx) ≈ log x + (Δx)/(x ln 10)]. Alternatively, maybe just approximate. I think log(4.17) is approximately 0.62, so:

log(0.0417) = log(4.17e-2) = log(4.17) + log(1e-2) → 0.62 -2 = -1.38.

So pOH = -log(0.0417) = 1.38 → pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

Wait, but none of the options match 12.62? Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) 12.62

B) 1.38

C) 8.92

D) 8.68

So option A is 12.62, which would be the case if the solution is basic, with excess OH-.

But wait, did I make a mistake in the stoichiometry?

Let's go back.

After adding all the solutions, the total volume is 1200 mL.

Moles of H+ from HCl: 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08.

Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09, but each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-, so 0.18 moles.

So OH- is 0.18.

H+ from HCl is 0.08. So OH- neutralizes H+ from HCl: 0.08 H+ reacts with 0.08 OH- → neutralizes, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH-.

Now, the OH- will react with H+ from CH3COOH. But CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't release all H+.

But in the presence of OH-, which is a strong base, the CH3COOH will donate H+ until it's all neutralized or until OH- is consumed.

So, the CH3COOH has 0.05 moles (from 0.1 M * 0.5 L). So OH- (0.10) can neutralize 0.05 of CH3COOH, producing 0.05 moles of CH3COO^-.

So after this, the OH- left is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles.

So total moles of OH- in solution is 0.05.

Total volume is 1.2 L, so concentration is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.04167 M.

pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38.

pH = 14 -1.38 =12.62, which matches option A.

Wait, but wait. Did I account for all the reactions correctly? Let me think again.

HCl is a strong acid, so it's fully dissociated. So its moles of H+ are 0.08.

Ba(OH)2 is strong base, so OH- is 0.18.

So H+ from HCl (0.08) neutralizes OH- (0.08), leaving 0.10 OH-.

Then, OH- will neutralize the H+ from CH3COOH. But CH3COOH is a weak acid, so the H+ is not all present. But in solution, OH- can react with CH3COOH.

The reaction is CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So, the 0.10 moles of OH- can react with CH3COOH. There are 0.05 moles of CH3COOH. So all of the CH3COOH is neutralized, and 0.05 moles of OH- remain.

So the remaining OH- is 0.05 moles in 1.2 L → 0.0417 M. So pOH is 1.38, pH is 12.62.

Therefore, the correct answer is A) 12.62.


To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions from the given reactants and their neutralization reactions.

### Step 1: Calculate moles of H⁺ and OH⁻
- **CH₃COOH (acetic acid):**  
  Moles = \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{moles} \).  
  Since CH₃COOH is a weak acid, its contribution to H⁺ is small and will be addressed later.

- **HCl (hydrochloric acid):**  
  Moles = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{moles} \).  
  HCl is a strong acid, so it fully dissociates, contributing \( 0.08 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \).

- **Ba(OH)₂ (barium hydroxide):**  
  Moles = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{moles} \).  
  Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ produces 2 moles of OH⁻, so total moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles} \).

### Step 2: Neutralization reactions
1. **Neutralization of H⁺ (from HCl) by OH⁻:**  
   H⁺ from HCl = \( 0.08 \, \text{moles} \).  
   OH⁻ = \( 0.18 \, \text{moles} \).  
   After neutralization, \( 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{moles of OH⁻ remain} \).

2. **Neutralization of OH⁻ by CH₃COOH:**  
   CH₃COOH = \( 0.05 \, \text{moles} \).  
   OH⁻ = \( 0.10 \, \text{moles} \).  
   OH⁻ reacts with CH₃COOH in a 1:1 ratio, neutralizing all \( 0.05 \, \text{moles of CH₃COOH} \), and leaving \( 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{moles of OH⁻} \).

### Step 3: Calculate [OH⁻] and pH
- Total volume of the solution = \( 500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L} \).  
- Concentration of OH⁻ = \( \frac{0.05 \, \text{moles}}{1.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.0417 \, \text{M} \).

- **pOH:**  
  \( \text{pOH} = -\log[OH⁻] = -\log(0.0417) \approx 1.38 \).

- **pH:**  
  \( \text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62 \).

### Final Answer:
The pH of the solution is **12.62**, corresponding to option **A**.
