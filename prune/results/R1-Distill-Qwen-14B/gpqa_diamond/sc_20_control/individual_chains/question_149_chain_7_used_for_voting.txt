Okay, so I have this NMR and LC-MS question here. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question is about a small peptidic compound that was chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum looks mostly right except for two peaks that are the same alpha-proton. The shifts are similar, integrals add up to 1H, and it's not spin-spin coupling because the coupling pattern rules that out. Then, the LC-MS shows two peaks with same mass, same intensity, and the mass spec is consistent with the expected molecule. What's going on?

Hmm. So NMR shows two peaks for the same proton. I remember when there's coupling, like with vicinal protons, you get splitting. But the question says spin-spin is ruled out, so it's not that. Maybe it's something else causing the peak duplication.

Possible options: The options are about different types of isomerism or impurities. Let's look at the options.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. So a precursor would have a different mass, right? The LC-MS shows same mass for both peaks, so that's probably not it. Because if it was a precursor, the mass would be higher, not same.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers have the same molecular mass, so that fits the LC-MS. But in NMR, enantiomers have the same chemical shifts because the environments are mirror images. However, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry or if the alpha proton's environment isn't affected by the stereochemistry, maybe the signals would be the same. But wait, if the molecule is a racemic mixture, in 1H NMR, you wouldn't see two separate peaks because the environments are identical. Unless there's some diastereotopicity or something else. Or perhaps if the molecule is chiral and the alpha protons are in a situation where the two enantiomers lead to different shifts? Wait, no, enantiomers usually have same shifts. Unless the coupling is influencing it, but the question says spin-spin is ruled out.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. I'm not exactly sure what that term means. Maybe it's a situation where two different coupling partners cause splitting, but the integration is correct. Like, perhaps an AB system where two protons are coupling each other. But in this case, the two peaks integrate to 1H total. Wait, if it's AB coupling, the two peaks would each integrate to 0.5H, but the signals would be split into doublets. But the question states that the two peaks are the same alpha-proton. That doesn't quite fit. Or maybe it's something else, like during the formation of the amide bond, an extra coupling occurred, leading to two peaks for the same proton. Not sure.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR would show different shifts. But wait, the question says the two peaks have similar chemical shifts. If they're diastereomers, their shifts would be similar but not the same, or maybe in some cases, same? Or could the diastereomers have the same shift for a particular proton? For example, if the diastereomers have the same environment for that proton. Wait, that's possible. For example, in some cases, like if the stereochemistry is on a different carbon, the alpha proton's environment might not change much. So in that case, two diastereomers could have the same shift for that proton, leading to two peaks. But then, why would that cause splitting? Or maybe the diastereomers have the same shift for that particular proton, but different elsewhere, but that's not the case here.

Wait, but the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha proton. So if the molecule is a diastereomer mixture, the alpha proton's shift might be the same, so we'd see two peaks. But why would the same proton be split into two? Or perhaps the diastereomers have different coupling constants, but the question says spin-spin coupling is ruled out. So maybe not.

Wait, another thought. If the compound is a diastereomer mixture, each diastereomer would have a different set of protons. But if the specific alpha proton in each diastereomer has the same environment, they'd have the same shift. So in the NMR, it would look like a singlet but integrating to 2H? But in the question, the integral adds up to 1H. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, the question says each of the two peaks has roughly equal integrals, together 1H. So each peak is about 0.5H. So that's more like two peaks each integrating to 0.5H, adding to 1H.

If it's a diastereomer mixture, the situation is more complicated. Alternatively, maybe it's a case of the compound being a racemic mixture (enantiomers). But in that case, the NMR would show a single peak for each proton because the environments are identical. Unless the coupling is in a way that... wait, perhaps it's a situation where the two enantiomers have different coupling patterns. But the problem states that spin-spin coupling is ruled out. So that's probably not it.

Wait, another possibility: the molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, but some protons are diastereotopic. No, that's when protons are in equivalent positions due to symmetry. Or perhaps the molecule is in a conformation where the same proton is split into two due to exchange or something else. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, the LC-MS part: two peaks with same mass. So same molecular weight. So same molecular formula, same structure. So it's not a precursor or product. So A is probably not correct.

So options are B, C, D.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. What does that mean? Maybe during the coupling reaction, the amide bond formed but there's another coupling, like maybe an elimination or something else. Or perhaps it's a case of a double bond where coupling occurs, but I'm not sure.

Another thought: if the amide bond formation leads to some sort of isotopic peak? No, isotopes are usually negligible in such cases.

Wait, the question says the 1H NMR has two peaks for the same alpha proton. So perhaps the alpha proton is experiencing two different types of splitting. But the coupling is not spin-spin (so not vicinal coupling), which leaves other possibilities, like scalar coupling or something else. Or maybe the proton is split by two different coupling partners. But that would typically lead to more than two peaks, unless it's a very specific case.

Wait, another possibility: the same alpha proton is in two different environments due to tautomerism or some other structural isomerism. But that would require the molecule to tautomerize, which I'm not sure about in a peptide context.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a mixture of two stereoisomers where the alpha proton is the same in both, but another proton is different. Wait, but the question specifies that the two peaks correspond to the same alpha-proton. So if the molecule is a diastereomer mixture, the alpha proton's shift remains the same, but other protons change. Then, why would the same alpha proton split into two peaks? Because in diastereomers, the shift can be same or different, but if it's same, the NMR would show a single peak for that proton, but integrating to 2H if it's a 50:50 mix. But the question says together they integrate to 1H. So each peak is 0.5H.

Wait, so if the molecule is a 50:50 racemic mixture (enantiomers), the alpha proton's shift would be the same. So in the NMR, you would see a single peak integrating to 2H, but the question says 1H. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of the compound being a diastereomer mixture with the same alpha proton. Let's say two diastereomers where the alpha proton has the same shift. Then, in the NMR, you'd see two peaks for that proton, each integrating to 0.5H. That would add up to 1H. And the LC-MS would see two peaks of same mass, since they're diastereomers of the same mass.

Wait, but diastereomers have different physical properties. So their NMR would show different shifts for some protons, but the same for others. So in this case, the alpha proton is the same in both, so same shift. So each diastereomer contributes 0.5H to that peak, making two peaks of 0.5H each. But wait, in reality, each diastereomer would have the same alpha proton, so each would contribute 1H as a singlet. So in the mixture, the integral would be 2H, but the question says it's 1H. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe each diastereomer has two alpha-protons, but I don't think that's the case. The question states it's the same alpha-proton with two peaks, each integrating to 0.5H.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is a double bond isomer, like cis and trans. But for a peptide, that's less likely. Unless the amide group is involved. But in that case, the amide proton is usually not an alpha-proton.

Wait, perhaps the problem is with the stereochemistry at the alpha carbon. So if the alpha carbon has two stereoisomers, each diastereomer would contribute to the NMR. But the problem is, would the alpha proton's shift be the same?

Alternatively, maybe the alpha proton is in a situation where there are two different coupling constants but same shift, leading to a doublet of doublets which might look like two separate peaks. Oh, but the question says the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. So that's probably not it.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the compound has a dynamic process, like a slow exchange. For example, if the alpha proton is involved in a process that's causing it to exchange between two environments on the NMR timescale. But that would usually average the signals, not create two separate peaks.

Wait, but if the exchange is slow, you might see separate peaks. However, in that case, the integration would be for each peak, and the total would be one or two. If the exchange is slow and the environment changes, you could have two peaks each integrating 0.5H. But I'm not sure why that would happen unless there's some kind of flux between conformers.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the crude compound hasn't been purified, so it's a mixture of the correct product and another byproduct that has the same mass. But the LC-MS says the same mass, so that's same molecular weight, same formula. So same molecule, but perhaps with a different structure that has the same mass. How?

Wait, perhaps it's a case of deuterated solvent or something else, but that doesn't make much sense here.

Wait, another angle: the question says the 1H NMR has two peaks, same shift, so perhaps they are not split but instead are due to something else. Maybe the chemical shift is duplicated because of different environments but same shift. Or perhaps it's due to coupling with another nucleus, but the question says spin-spin is ruled out.

Wait, looking back at the options. Option C is 'double coupling' during amide bond formation. I think 'double coupling' might refer to a situation where the amide bond formation leads to an additional coupling, like maybe a geminal coupling or something else. But I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, another possibility: if the amide bond is formed via a reaction that creates two different coupling constants for the same proton. But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the amide bond formation is causing some kind of ring structure where the proton has two different coupling partners, leading to two peaks. But I'm not clear on this.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a result of the presence of a double bond adjacent to the alpha carbon, causing the alpha proton to split into two peaks due to coupling with the double bond protons. But again, the question says spin-spin coupling is ruled out.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about each option again.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. The mass would be higher, so LC-MS would show a different mass. But question says same mass. So A is out.

Option B: Enantiomers. Same mass, same NMR shifts. But for enantiomers, the alpha proton's shift would be the same, so NMR would show only 1 peak for that proton, integrating 2H if racemic. But the question says the two peaks add to 1H, so each is 0.5H. So NMR would have two peaks each 0.5H, which wouldn't be the case for enantiomers. So B is probably not the answer.

Option C: Double coupling during amide bond formation. Could this cause the same alpha proton to split into two peaks? Maybe. For example, if the amide formation leads to the alpha proton being coupled to two different sets of protons. But in that case, the splitting would lead to more than two peaks, perhaps a triplet or quartet. Or maybe an AB system where two protons are each coupling to the same proton, leading to two doublets. But each would have integral 0.5H, which matches the question. So in this case, the same alpha proton is coupled to two different protons, leading to two peaks. But the question says spin-spin coupling is ruled out, so it's not about coupling to neighboring protons. Wait, maybe it's a case of the amide proton coupling to the alpha proton in a way that creates two peaks. But I'm a bit confused here.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have same mass, so LC-MS matches. In NMR, if the diastereomers have the same shift for the alpha proton, then you'd see two peaks each integrating to 0.5H. Wait, but each diastereomer would have the same shift for that proton, so it would appear as a single peak with integral 2H, right? Unless each diastereomer contributes a peak of 0.5H each. But how?

Wait, perhaps it's a 50:50 mixture of two diastereomers where the alpha proton in each has the same shift. Then, each diastereomer would contribute 1H, so the NMR would show a peak integrating to 2H. But the question says the integral adds to 1H, so that doesn't fit. So maybe D isn't the right answer.

Wait, but the question says that together, the two peaks correspond to the same alpha-proton and integrate to 1H. So each peak is 0.5H. So it's like the alpha proton is split into two signals, each 0.5H. So this could happen if the alpha proton is diastereotopic, which means that in a chiral environment, the two protons that were equivalent become non-equivalent, leading to two signals. But wait, diastereotopic protons are a form of diastereomerism within a molecule. So perhaps the molecule itself is not a mixture, but each molecule has diastereotopic alpha protons.

Wait, that's a possibility. If the molecule has stereogenic centers adjacent to the alpha carbon, causing the alpha protons to be diastereotopic. For example, if the alpha carbon is connected to two different stereogenic centers, the two alpha protons (if present) could become diastereotopic. But wait, the question says it's the same alpha-proton, so perhaps it's a single proton that's split into two due to coupling with adjacent stereogenic centers.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule has an internal plane of asymmetry, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the problem might be about the presence of two different diastereomers, each with the same alpha-proton shift. So each diastereomer contributes 0.5H, so the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton, each 0.5H. But how would that happen? Each diastereomer would have their own set of protons, but the same alpha proton. So the NMR would see each diastereomer's alpha proton as a separate peak. But if both have the same shift, it would just look like a single peak of 2H. Unless the diastereomers have different coupling constants, but that's what the question said is ruled out.

This is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to summarize:

- The NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton, same shift, integral 0.5 each.
- LC-MS shows two same mass peaks, same intensity.
- Coupling isn't the issue.

The options are B, C, D.

Option D: diastereomers. Each would have same mass, so fits LC-MS. In NMR, if the diastereomers have same shift for that proton, but others differ. But the same alpha proton would integrate 2H as a singlet. But question says 1H. So perhaps not.

Wait, wait. If the mixture is 50:50 of two diastereomers, each with one alpha-proton, but the shift is same. Then the NMR would show a peak for 2H, but the question says 1H. So that can't be.

Alternative logic: perhaps the problem is that the alpha-proton has two different coupling partners in the same molecule, leading to a doublet of doublets, but that's spin-spin coupling, which the question excludes.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is caused by a byproduct where the same alpha-proton is split into two due to other factors, but same mass, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the answer is D. Because diastereomers can have the same mass, and if the alpha-proton's shift is same in both, but the coupling leads to two separate peaks.

But if the coupling is not spin-spin, then what? Maybe the diastereomers have the same shift but different coupling constants. But the question says spin-spin is ruled out, so that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps it's not about coupling. If the same alpha-proton is split into two due to the presence of diastereomers, but each diastereomer contributes a peak. But why would that happen?

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about another approach: which of these options would lead to same mass, same NMR shifts except for the same alpha-proton appearing as two peaks, and same LC-MS.

Option C: Double coupling during amide bond formation. If during the reaction, the amide bond formed but the alpha-proton is now coupled to two different groups. For example, in the amide formation, perhaps the alpha-proton becomes coupled to two different protons, but the coupling isn't spin-spin. Hmm, but that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the presence of a double bond in the molecule (maybe in the side chain) which causes the alpha-proton to have two different environments, leading to two peaks. But then why same mass?

Wait, no, same mass because same molecule.

I think I'm not getting anywhere. Let's try to look for the correct answer.

The most likely explanation is that the compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers (Option D). Because diastereomers have the same molecular weight, which explains the LC-MS. In the NMR, if the alpha proton is in a different environment in each diastereomer, but perhaps their shifts are the same, leading to two peaks. But I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, another angle: if the molecule has a double bond, like in a proline residue or similar, the alpha-proton could be split by coupling with the double bond protons. But again, the question says spin-spin is ruled out.

Hmm. Another possibility: the presence of a byproduct where the same mass is present, but that's not likely because the question says the same mass.

Wait, another thought: the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton, but with same shift. That could be due to a doubling in the signal, perhaps because the proton is in a dynamic situation, but that would usually average the signal, not split it. Unless the exchange rate is very fast, but that would cause a single peak with higher integration.

Wait, perhaps it's a result of the presence of two different isomers where the alpha-proton is in the same chemical environment but coupled to different things, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if the alpha-proton is in a situation where it's split by scalar coupling (like through space) into two, but that's a bit beyond my current understanding.

Wait, looking back, the question says that the two peaks have similar chemical shifts. So not very different. So maybe it's a case of a small diastereotopic shift, but the problem is that the integral adds to 1H.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a 1:1 mixture of two diastereomers where the alpha-proton is split into two due to the diastereomerism. So each contributes a peak, adding to 1H total. But why would each diastereomer contribute 0.5H? Maybe each isomer has two alpha-protons, but that's not the case. The question says the same alpha-proton.

Wait, perhaps the alpha-proton is actually split into two due to the presence of two different coupling partners, but not spin-spin. I'm really not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is the presence of a double bond in the molecule and the alpha-proton is part of a conjugated system, causing a doublet. But again, the question states that spin-spin is ruled out.

I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess. Let me think about the options again.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. They have same mass, so LC-MS matches. In the NMR, if the diastereomers have same shift for a particular proton, then you'd see two peaks each with 0.5H, adding to 1H. Because diastereomers can have same shift for some protons while others differ. So the same alpha proton in each diastereomer would appear as two separate peaks. So that explains the NMR. And the other peaks in the NMR would be different because of the diastereomers. But the question says the NMR is otherwise consistent, so other protons must have the same shifts, which is unlikely unless the diastereomers are very similar in structure except for a small change.

Alternatively, perhaps the diastereomers are enantiomers, but that can't be because enantiomers are a subset of diastereomers. Wait, no, enantiomers are a type of diastereomer.

Wait, but if the diastereomers are mirror images, that's enantiomers. So perhaps the question is about enantiomers. But earlier I thought that the NMR would show a single peak, but the integral would be 2H, which doesn't fit the question.

I'm not getting anywhere. But looking at the options, the LC-MS shows same mass, so it's same molecular formula. So the compound is either a stereoisomer (enantiomer or diastereomer) or something else.

If it's a diastereomer, then each has same mass, so LC-MS would show two peaks of same mass. That fits. In NMR, if the alpha-proton is in the same environment in both diastereomers, same shift, but each contributes 0.5H, leading to two peaks. But how can that happen?

Wait, perhaps the diastereomers have the same number of alpha protons, but each has only one alpha proton. So in the mixture, each contributes 0.5H to that proton, hence two peaks.

Wait, but why would the same alpha proton split into two? Unless each diastereomer has the same shift but is a separate entity.

I think the correct answer must be D. Because diastereomers have same mass, and the NMR would show two peaks if each contributes 0.5H. But I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, another angle: if the compound has a double bond, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated amide, the alpha-proton could be deshielded and split into two due to coupling with the double bond. But the question says spin-spin is ruled out, so that's not the case.

Another thought: the problem could be due to the presence of two different tautomers. Tautomers have different structures but same molecular weight. So in LC-MS, same mass, and in NMR, same shift. But in this case, the alpha-proton would have same shift, so why two peaks?

Alternatively, perhaps the same alpha-proton is split into two due to coupling with another proton in the same molecule, but that would be spin-spin coupling, which the question says is ruled out.

Wait, another possibility: the crude compound may have formed a dimer or some oligomer. But that would likely show different shifts and different molecular weights.

I think I've exhausted my options, and the most plausible explanation is that the compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers, which leads to two NMR peaks for the same alpha-proton, same shift, each integrating 0.5H. So the answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves analyzing a small peptidic compound where the 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks corresponding to the same alpha-proton, with similar chemical shifts and integrals adding up to 1H. The LC-MS analysis reveals two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass, consistent with the expected molecule. The task is to determine the most likely explanation for these observations.

### Key Observations and Analysis:
1. **NMR Spectrum**:
   - Two peaks for the same alpha-proton are observed, with similar chemical shifts and integrals adding up to 1H (0.5H each).
   - Spin-spin coupling is ruled out as the cause of the duplicate peaks.

2. **LC-MS Analysis**:
   - Two peaks with the same mass and intensity are observed, indicating the same molecular formula for both components.

3. **Options Analysis**:
   - **Option A (Contaminated with a precursor)**: A precursor would have a different molecular mass, but the LC-MS shows the same mass for both peaks. This rules out contamination with a precursor.
   - **Option B (Mixture of enantiomers)**: Enantiomers have the same molecular mass, which fits the LC-MS data. However, enantiomers typically produce a single peak for each proton in the NMR spectrum because their environments are mirror images. For a racemic mixture, the alpha-proton would integrate to 2H as a single peak, not 1H. Thus, this option does not fit the NMR data.
   - **Option C ('Double coupling' during amide-bond forming reaction)**: This option suggests that the alpha-proton is coupled to two different groups, potentially leading to two peaks. However, the question explicitly rules out spin-spin coupling, and the term "double coupling" is ambiguous. This explanation is less likely.
   - **Option D (Mixture of diastereoisomers)**: Diastereoisomers have the same molecular mass, fitting the LC-MS data. In the NMR, if the alpha-proton is in the same chemical environment in both diastereomers, it would appear as two peaks (0.5H each) due to the presence of two distinct diastereomers. This explanation aligns with both the NMR and LC-MS observations.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible explanation is that the compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers. The diastereoisomers have the same molecular mass, explaining the LC-MS data, and the same alpha-proton environment, leading to two peaks in the NMR spectrum with integrals adding up to 1H.

**Answer: D**
