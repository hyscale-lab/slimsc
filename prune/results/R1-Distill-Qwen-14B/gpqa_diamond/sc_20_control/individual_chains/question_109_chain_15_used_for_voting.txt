Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons and their quantum states. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to break it down.

The question says we have two nucleons in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X which has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics are involved, so I remember that Pauli's exclusion principle affects the symmetry of the wavefunction. For identical particles, the total wavefunction has to be antisymmetric under exchange, right? So the product of the spin, spatial, and other symmetry parts must be antisymmetric.

Wait, the problem mentions an equation: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. I think T is the isospin, S is the spin, and L is the orbital angular momentum. So the sum of S, L, and 1 should equal T modulo 2. Since T(NN) is 0, let's plug that in.

So T = 0 = S + L +1 mod 2. That means S + L must be 1 mod 2. So S + L is odd. Which would mean S and L are of opposite parity. So if S is even, L is odd, or vice versa.

The initial state is 1S0. Wait, the notation is (2S+1)LJ, so 1S0 means S=0 because 2*0+1=1. So L is S here—no, wait, the first part is 1, which is 2S+1, so S=0. And the L is S, which I think is the orbital part. Wait, no, the 1S0 is (2S+1)LJ. So S is the spin, L is the orbital angular momentum. So for 1S0, S=0, L=0, and J=0 because J = L + S. So the initial state has spin 0, orbital angular momentum 0, and total J=0.

Now, the NN state after emitting X is given to have T=0. So according to the equation, S (their spin) + L (their orbital) must be odd. So S+L is 1 mod 2.

So when the nucleons emit a particle X, the final state of the NN pair must have S and L such that S + L is odd. Also, the parity must be conserved. The parity operator P is related to angular momentum and intrinsic parity of the emitted particle.

The initial state parity is given by the parity operator acting on the 1S0 state. Parity for a state with orbital angular momentum L is (-1)^L. So for 1S0, L=0, so parity is (-1)^0 = +1.

When X is emitted, its intrinsic parity is -1. So the parity of the process must be conserved. So the parity of the initial state should equal the product of the parities of the final states.

Wait, the initial parity is P_initial = (+1) because L=0.

The final state is the NN state and the particle X. So the parity of the final state is P_final = P_NN * P_X.

Because parity is multiplicative. So P_initial = P_NN * P_X.

So P_initial is +1. P_X is given as -1. So P_NN must be (-1) because (+1) = P_NN * (-1) → P_NN = (-1)/(-1) → wait, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, no, equation is P_initial = P_NN * P_X. So 1 = P_NN * (-1). So P_NN = -1. Because 1 = (-1) * P_NN → P_NN = -1.

So the parity of the NN state is -1. Now, the parity of the NN state is (-1)^{L(NN)} because their orbital angular momentum is L. So (-1)^L = -1 → L must be odd.

So L(NN) is odd. So L must be 1,3,5,... etc.

But from earlier, S + L must be odd. So if L is odd, S must be even to make S+L odd. Because odd + even = odd. So S must be even.

But wait, what is S here? The spin quantum number for the NN pair. So S can be 0, 1, 2, etc. But for two nucleons, each with spin 1/2, their combined spin can be 0 (singlet) or 1 (triplet). So the possible S values are 0 and 1.

Wait, but the question is about the final state's S. So S is the total spin of the NN pair.

Wait, but in the initial state, the NN pair has S=0 (since it's 1S0). But when they emit X, their spin could change? Hmm, but I'm not sure. Maybe in the reaction, the orbital angular momentum might change.

Wait, the problem says the NN state after emission has certain properties. So the initial NN is 1S0, which is S=0, L=0, J=0. Then they emit X, so the final NN state could have different S and L.

But when considering angular momentum conservation, the total angular momentum J must be conserved. But I think the problem is more about the parity and the Pauli statistics condition.

So, let's summarize:

- Final state: T=0, so S + L is odd (since 0 = S + L + 1 mod 2 → S + L = 1 mod 2 → odd)
- The parity of the NN state is -1, which implies L is odd (since parity is (-1)^L → L is odd)
- So L is odd, which means S must be even (since S + L is odd)
- S can be 0 or 1 for two nucleons. So if L is odd, S must be even → S=0 (since 0 is even and 1 is odd)
Wait, no. Wait, S is the total spin, which can be 0 or 1. So if L is odd, and S must be even, then S can only be 0. Because 0 is even, 1 is odd. So S=0.

So the final NN state has S=0, L=odd, T=0.

Now, looking at the options, each option involves a transition from the initial 1S0 state to a final state with some angular momentum (lowercase letter denotes the state of X). Each option is of the form 1S0 → something + X. Let me parse each option:

Option A: 1S0 → 7D1 + p. So X is a proton (p) here. The final NN state is 7D1. Let me think. The state is (2S+1)LJ. 7D1 → (2S+1) =7 → S=3 (since 2*3+1=7). L is D, which is 2. So L=2. J=1.

Wait, but earlier we found that in the final state, S must be 0? Because S=0 when L is odd because S must be even. Wait, but in this option, the final state is 7D1, which would have S=3. So that would not fit because S would be 3 (odd), and L=2 (even). S + L would be 3+2=5, which is odd. So that would fit the condition of S + L being odd. But wait, we thought that S must be even because L is odd.

Wait, wait. Let me re-examine. Earlier conclusion was that L is odd, so L=1,3, etc. So if the final state's L is odd, then S must be even (so S=0). So in option A, the final NN state is 7D1. So L is 2, which is even. So that's a problem because earlier we have L must be odd. So that's a contradiction. So option A's final state has L=2, which is even. But our analysis says L must be odd. So option A is forbidden because it would require L even, which doesn't satisfy the parity condition.

Wait, but let's check each option in terms of their L and S.

Let me go through each option:

Option A: 7D1 → S=3 (since (2S+1)=7 → S=3), L=2, J=1. So S=3 (odd), L=2 (even). S+L is 5 (odd). That fits the condition (S+L is odd). But L is even, which contradicts our earlier conclusion that L must be odd (since P_NN is -1 → (-1)^L = -1 → L is odd). So option A's L is 2 (even), which is wrong. So this transition is not allowed.

Option B: 3S1. So (2S+1) =3 → S=1. L is S, which is 0? Wait, no, the state is 3S1. So 3 is (2S+1), so S=1. L is S? No, no. Let me parse the state: the state is given as (2S+1)LJ. So 3S1: (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L is S? No, wait, the 'S' in the spectroscopic notation is the orbital angular momentum. So S is the orbital part. Oh wait, no. The first letter is S, P, D... which corresponds to L=0,1,2...

So in 3S1: (2S+1)=3 → S=1 (so spin 1), L is S? No, L is the letter's value. Wait, no. The second part is L, and the letter indicates L: S=0, P=1, D=2, etc. So in 3S1, L=0 (since it's S), S=1 (from 2S+1=3), J=1.

Wait, but earlier we found that L must be odd. So in this case, L=0 (even). So the parity of the NN state is (-1)^L → (-1)^0 = +1, but we need parity of NN to be -1. So this final state would have parity +1, which doesn't match the required P_NN = -1. So this is not allowed.

Option B: L=0, which gives parity +1, but we need -1. So this is forbidden.

Option C: 3D3. So (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L is D → L=2. J=3.

So S=1 (odd), L=2 (even). S+L=3 → odd. So that fits the condition (S+L is odd). Also, the parity of the NN state is (-1)^L → (-1)^2 = +1. But we needed P_NN to be -1. So this is a problem. Because the parity would be +1, so this option is not allowed.

Option D: 3P0. (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L is P → L=1. J=0.

So S=1 (odd), L=1 (odd). S + L = 2 → even. Wait, but earlier condition was S+L must be odd. So this would not fit. So this transition is not allowed. Wait, but let me double-check.

Wait, in option D, the final state is 3P0. So S=1, L=1. S+L=2, which is even. Earlier condition says S+L must be odd. So this would violate the condition. So this is forbidden.

Wait, but what about the parity? For option D, L=1, so parity is (-1)^1 = -1. Which matches the required P_NN = -1. So parity is correct, but the S+L condition is not met.

So let me re-examine each option:

Option A: Final NN state: 7D1 → L=2, S=3. S is 3 (odd), L=2 (even). S+L=5 (odd) → condition met. But parity is (-1)^2=+1 → doesn't match required -1. So option A is forbidden.

Option B: Final state 3S1 → L=0, S=1. S+L=1 (odd) → condition met. But parity is (-1)^0=+1 → doesn't match required -1. So forbidden.

Option C: Final state 3D3 → L=2, S=1. S+L=3 (odd) → condition met. Parity is (-1)^2 = +1 → doesn't match. Forbidden.

Option D: Final state 3P0 → L=1, S=1. S+L=2 (even) → condition not met. Parity is (-1)^1 = -1 → correct. But because the S+L condition isn't met, it's forbidden.

Wait, but the problem says which partial wave is not permitted. So the forbidden one is the one that violates either the parity or the S+L condition.

Wait, the options are about the state X. Each option has a different X emitted, with its own angular momentum (the lowercase letter).

Wait, each option's format is: initial state → final NN state + X.

So for each option, the total angular momentum must be conserved, and parity must be conserved.

Wait, perhaps I should also think about the angular momentum. The initial state has J=0. So the final state's total J must also be zero. So the sum of the NN's J and X’s J must be zero. So J_NN + J_X must be zero. But since angular momentum is a vector, it's more about vector addition. Wait, but I'm not sure if the problem is asking about that, or just the conditions on isospin, spin, and angular momentum.

The problem says to make use of conservation of both angular momentum and parity. So I probably need to consider that.

Wait, for each option, the initial state is 1S0 (J=0). The final state is NN in some state plus X. So the total J must be conserved. So J_NN + J_X must equal initial J=0. So J_NN and J_X must be the same, but opposite vectors. But since J is a magnitude, perhaps J_NN = J_X and opposite in direction.

But perhaps more importantly, the sum should be zero. So the possible way is that J_NN = J_X, but they are opposite vectors, leading to a total of zero. So that their sum is zero.

Wait, but in terms of quantum numbers, the initial state has J=0. So the sum of the final state's angular momenta (NN and X) must be zero. So in terms of quantum numbers, J_NN and J_X must satisfy that their vector sum is zero. But for that, they must have the same magnitude and opposite directions.

So J_NN = J_X, and their directions cancel each other. So their sum is zero.

So for each option, we'll have to check whether J_NN equals J_X. Because if J_NN and J_X are the same, their vector sum can be zero if they are opposite.

Wait, but in terms of possible quantum numbers, the only way their sum can be zero is if their J's are the same, and their spins are arranged to cancel. But perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is more about the isospin and parity conditions, which I've already started analyzing.

But let's go back to the options and see which ones violate the initial conditions.

We can make a table:

Option | Final NN State | S | L | J | Parity (NN) | S+L | S+L parity | Required | Condition
A | 7D1 | 3 | 2 | 1 | (-1)^2=+1 | 3+2=5 → odd | S+L odd → condition met | Parity NN must be -1 → +1 doesn't match → forbidden
B | 3S1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | (-1)^0=+1 | 1+0=1 → odd → condition met | Parity doesn't match → forbidden
C |3D3 |1 |2 |3 |+1 → no → forbidden | S+L=3 → odd → condition met
D |3P0 |1 |1 |0 |-1 → correct parity | S+L=1+1=2 → even → condition not met → forbidden

So all options except perhaps none meet both conditions. But I think I made a mistake because the options probably have only one forbidden.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the Pauli statistics condition again. The equation given is T = S + L +1 mod 2. But T is 0. So S + L must be 1 mod 2 → S+L is odd.

So for each option:

Option A: S=3, L=2 → 3+2=5 → odd → condition met. But parity of NN is +1 (wrong). So forbidden.

Option B: S=1, L=0 → 1+0=1 → odd → condition met. Parity of NN is +1 (wrong). Forbidden.

Option C: S=1, L=2 → 3 → odd → condition met. Parity of NN is +1 (wrong). Forbidden.

Option D: S=1, L=1 → 2 → even → condition not met. Parity correct (-1). So condition not met → forbidden.

Wait, that's strange. All options are violating either the parity or the S+L condition. But that can't be the case. Probably I made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, the problem is about the partial wave emitted; the X's angular momentum state. The initial state is 1S0 (J=0). The final state is NN in some state plus X in a certain state. Also, the parity of the process must be conserved.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the parity more carefully. The parity of the initial state is P_initial = (-1)^L_initial. Since initial L is 0, parity is +1.

The parity of the final state is P_final = P_NN * P_X * (-1)^{L_X}, no, wait. Hmm.

Wait, the parity operator P acts on the orbital angular momentum, so for each particle, parity flips the orbital angular momentum. So for a process, the parity is the product of the parities of each part.

Wait, the total parity after emission is P_NN * P_X * (-1)^{L_X + L_NN_initial}, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, in a decay process, the parity of the initial state must equal the product of the parities of the final particles.

But I think it's more accurate to think that for the entire process, the parity is conserved. So initial parity = final parity.

The initial state has parity P_initial = (−1)^{L_initial} = (−1)^0 = +1.

The final state consists of the NN pair in a state with parity P_NN = (−1)^{L_NN} and the emitted particle X with intrinsic parity P_X = -1. So the total parity of the final state is P_NN * P_X.

So, P_initial = P_NN * P_X → 1 = P_NN * (-1) → P_NN = -1 * P_initial / P_X → Wait, let's compute that.

We have 1 = P_NN * (-1) → P_NN = -1. So the NN state must have parity -1. Which implies that L_NN must be odd, as earlier thought.

So all the options where the NN state has even L are forbidden. So let's look again:

Option A: NN state is 7D1 → L=2 → even → parity +1 → forbidden.

Option B: NN state is 3S1 → L=0 → even → parity +1 → forbidden.

Option C: NN state is 3D3 → L=2 → even → parity +1 → forbidden.

Option D: NN state is 3P0 → L=1 → odd → parity (-1)^1 = -1 → allowed.

So only option D has L=1, which makes P_NN=-1. So the parity condition is met for option D.

But earlier, for option D, S=1, L=1. So S+L=2 → even. But our condition requires S+L must be odd. So for option D, this condition is not met, which is required.

So option D: parity is correct, but S+L is even → violates the condition.

But wait, the initial state's T is 0, so S_NN + L_NN +1 must be even. Because T=0 is even, so 0 ≡ (S+L +1) mod 2 → S+L must be 1 mod 2 (odd). So S+L must be odd.

So option D has S+L=2 → even → condition not met. So it's forbidden.

So all options except perhaps none meet the condition. Wait, that can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let's recheck option D. The final state is 3P0.

So (2S+1) =3 → S=1.

L is P → L=1.

So S=1, L=1. S+L=2 → even. So condition not met. So option D is forbidden.

But the problem says which partial wave is not permitted. So only option D meets the parity condition but fails the S+L condition.

Wait, but let's think about the initial and final angular momenta.

The initial state has J=0. The final state must have J=0.

The initial state has J=0, so the sum of the final J's must also be zero.

In each option, the final NN state has J, and the X has its own J. So their sum must be zero.

So for each option, we need J_NN + J_X = 0.

But angular momentum is a vector, so the only way this can happen is if their J's are equal and opposite. But since the options give the angular momentum quantum numbers, perhaps the only way J_NN = J_X for their sum to be zero is if the vectors are opposite, but the problem is in the context of possible angular momentum states.

But perhaps the problem is that in each option, J_NN and J_X must be zero, but that's impossible unless J_NN=0 and J_X=0.

Wait, but let's check each option:

Option A: J_NN=1, J_X=p (which is a proton, but the J of X isn't given, but in the option, X is in a state denoted by the lowercase letter. Wait, the options are written as 1S0 → 7D1 + p. So the p denotes the particle, and its angular momentum state might be determined by the letter.

Wait, the problem says the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X. So in option A, X is in state 'p' → which is P state, so L=1. But what about its spin? Wait, the term symbol for X would be something like L=1, but what about spin? Wait, the particle X's angular momentum is given by its state. So in option A, X is in a P state → L=1, but what about its spin? I'm not sure, but perhaps the problem treats X as a spin-0 particle? Or perhaps it's a photon, which is spin-1? No, the problem says X has intrinsic parity -1. So for example, a pion (spin 0) has parity -1.

Wait, maybe the X particle's spin is zero. So its term symbol would be something like ^2S+1LJ. For spin zero, it's 1L0.

Wait, but in the options, the X's angular momentum state is given as a lowercase letter, which probably corresponds to its orbital angular momentum. So in option A, X is in a 'p' state, which is L=1. So X's orbital angular momentum is 1. If X is spin-0, then its J is 1 (L=1, S=0 → J=1).

So the final state's total angular momentum is J_NN + J_X.

In option A:

J_NN is 1 (from 7D1, which has J=1). J_X is 1 (from 'p' state, L=1, S=0 → J=1). So J_NN=1, J_X=1. How can their sum be zero? The only way is if their directions are opposite, but quantum mechanically, the sum could be zero if they are in a singlet state. Wait, but in reality, the sum would require that their angular momenta vectors cancel each other. But in quantum terms, the sum of two spin-1 particles can't be zero unless they are in a state where their total spin is zero, which is possible, but perhaps that's beyond what we need for this problem.

But I think the key point is that the problem is about the conditions on S, L, and T, not the exact angular momentum conservation in terms of vector addition. So perhaps the problem is only concerned with the isospin, spin, and orbital angular momentum conditions.

So, considering everything again, the only option that meets the parity condition is option D. However, option D doesn't meet the S+L condition, so it's forbidden. But what about the others?

Wait, another approach: the initial state has T=0, S=0, L=0.

When the NN pair emits X, their T, S, L must satisfy T = (S + L +1) mod 2.

So T=0 → (S + L +1) mod 2 =0 → S + L =1 mod 2 → S + L is odd.

The parity condition requires that L is odd (since P_NN = (-1)^L = -1 → L is odd).

So S must be even → S=0 (since two nucleons can have S=0 or 1).

So in the final state, S=0 and L is odd.

So looking at the options, which option has the final NN state with S=0 and L odd.

Looking at each option's final NN state:

Option A: 7D1 → S=3 (from 7 → 2S+1=7 → S=3). Not zero. So no.

Option B: 3S1 → S=1. Not zero. So no.

Option C:3D3 → S=1. Not zero. No.

Option D:3P0 → S=1. No.

Wait, none of the options have S=0. So this suggests that all the options are forbidden. But that can't be right because the question implies that one is not permitted.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the final state has S=0. Because the initial state has S=0, but after emission, the spin could change? But I thought that for two nucleons, their spin can only be 0 or 1. Hmm, but perhaps the spin state can change.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the reaction: the initial state is NN in 1S0 (S=0, L=0), and then they emit X. So the NN pair's final state can have higher L and S. But the condition from Pauli's exclusion is that T(NN)= S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2.

Wait, perhaps I should compute T for each option's final state and see if it equals 0.

Because T is given as 0.

For each option, compute T = (S + L +1) mod 2.

If T is 0, it's allowed; if not, it's forbidden.

So:

Option A: S=3, L=2.

T = (3 + 2 +1) mod 2 →6 mod2=0 → allowed.

But parity of NN state is +1 → forbidden.

Option B: S=1, L=0.

T= (1+0 +1)=2 → mod2=0 → allowed.

Parity of NN state is +1 → forbidden.

Option C: S=1, L=2.

T= (1+2+1)=4 →mod2=0 → allowed.

Parity of NN state is +1 → forbidden.

Option D: S=1, L=1.

T= (1+1 +1)=3 → mod2=1 → T=1≠0 → forbidden.

So according to this, the only option with T=0 is options A, B, C. But they're forbidden because their parity is wrong. Option D has T=1, which is not allowed, so it's forbidden.

Wait, but the problem says that the final state has T=0. So any option with T not equal to 0 is forbidden.

So option D has T=1, which is not allowed. So it's forbidden.

So the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So the options are:

Which option's final state doesn't meet T=0?

Option D's final state leads to T=1, which is not allowed, so it cannot occur.

Wait, but wait. The problem says that the final state has T=0. So all options except the correct one must have T=0.

So the forbidden option is the one where T≠0.

In this case, option D leads to T=1, so it's forbidden. So the answer is option D.

Wait, but the other options have T=0 but wrong parity, so they are also forbidden. But the question is which is not permitted. It's possible that all except one are allowed, but according to the reasoning, option D is the only one with T=1, which is not allowed.

But the problem statement says that the final state has T=0. So the options that don't have T=0 are forbidden.

So, the conclusion is that option D is forbidden because it leads to T=1 instead of 0.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. The conditions provided are:

1. **Pauli Statistics**: The isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy \( T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \).
2. **Parity Conservation**: The parity of the initial state must equal the product of the parities of the final states.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial State**: The initial state is 1S0, which corresponds to \( S = 0 \), \( L = 0 \), and \( J = 0 \). The parity of the initial state is \( (-1)^L = (+1) \).

2. **Final State Conditions**:
   - The final NN state has \( T(NN) = 0 \). Using the given relation \( T = S + L + 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \), this implies \( S + L + 1 \equiv 0 \, (\text{mod } 2) \), or \( S + L \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \). Thus, \( S + L \) must be odd.
   - The parity of the final NN state is \( (-1)^L \). Since the total parity must be conserved, the parity of the NN state must be \( -1 \), implying \( L \) is odd.

   Combining these, the final NN state must have:
   - \( L \) odd.
   - \( S \) even (since \( S + L \) is odd and \( L \) is odd).

3. **Possible \( S \) Values**: For two nucleons, \( S \) can only be 0 (singlet) or 1 (triplet). Since \( S \) must be even, \( S = 0 \) is the only possibility for the final NN state.

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   Each option specifies a final NN state and the emitted particle \( X \). The final NN state must satisfy \( S = 0 \) and \( L \) odd. Let us evaluate each option:

   - **Option A**: \( 7D1 \)
     - \( (2S+1) = 7 \implies S = 3 \) (odd).
     - \( L = 2 \) (even).
     - \( S + L = 3 + 2 = 5 \), which is odd (condition met).
     - Parity of NN state: \( (-1)^L = (-1)^2 = +1 \) (does not match required parity of -1).
     - **Forbidden**.

   - **Option B**: \( 3S1 \)
     - \( (2S+1) = 3 \implies S = 1 \) (odd).
     - \( L = 0 \) (even).
     - \( S + L = 1 + 0 = 1 \), which is odd (condition met).
     - Parity of NN state: \( (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1 \) (does not match required parity of -1).
     - **Forbidden**.

   - **Option C**: \( 3D3 \)
     - \( (2S+1) = 3 \implies S = 1 \) (odd).
     - \( L = 2 \) (even).
     - \( S + L = 1 + 2 = 3 \), which is odd (condition met).
     - Parity of NN state: \( (-1)^L = (-1)^2 = +1 \) (does not match required parity of -1).
     - **Forbidden**.

   - **Option D**: \( 3P0 \)
     - \( (2S+1) = 3 \implies S = 1 \) (odd).
     - \( L = 1 \) (odd).
     - \( S + L = 1 + 1 = 2 \), which is even (condition not met).
     - Parity of NN state: \( (-1)^L = (-1)^1 = -1 \) (matches required parity).
     - **Forbidden**.

### Conclusion:
All options fail either the parity condition or the \( S + L \) condition. However, the problem specifies that the final state has \( T(NN) = 0 \). For \( T(NN) = 0 \), \( S + L \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \). Option D violates this condition because \( S + L = 2 \), which is even. Therefore, **Option D is the only partial wave that is not permitted**.

Answer: D
