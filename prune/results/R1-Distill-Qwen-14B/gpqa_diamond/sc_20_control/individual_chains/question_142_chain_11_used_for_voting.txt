Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the density matrix of a qubit. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives the density matrix rho as 1/2 times (|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, so rho = (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. I remember that density matrices describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. Pure states are represented by density matrices that are projectors, like |psi><psi|, but this one is a mixture of |0> and |1>, each with a weight of 1/2.

So, what does this state represent? Well, if it's an equal mixture of |0> and |1>, that sounds like a completely mixed state for a qubit. But wait, in a qubit space, the state can be visualized on the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a geometric representation of qubit states where pure states are on the surface and mixed states are inside.

The Bloch vector for a density matrix rho is given by r = [x, y, z], where the components are the expectation values of the Pauli matrices divided by 2. Oh wait, no, more precisely, the density matrix can be expressed using the Pauli matrices like this: rho = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is the Bloch vector.

So let's expand rho. The given rho is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me compute that. |0><0| is the matrix diag(1,0), and |1><1| is diag(0,1). Adding them gives diag(1,1), then multiply by 1/2: diag(1/2, 1/2). So rho is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]].

Now, let's express rho in terms of the Pauli matrices. The identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]], and the Pauli matrices are:
σx = [[0,1],[1,0]],
σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]],
σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]].

The general form is rho = (I + r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz)/2. Comparing this to our rho, which is (I + 0 σx + 0 σy + 0 σz)/2. Because when I plug in r_x, r_y, r_z as zero, I get (I)/2, which is exactly what our rho is. Oh wait, wait, no. Because when I look at the expansion, (I + sum(r_i σ_i))/2. So for our rho, which is (I)/2, that would imply that the sum of r_i σ_i is zero. Which would mean each r_i is zero.

So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). That's the origin in the Bloch sphere. Which makes sense because the state is completely mixed. For a pure state, the Bloch vector would have a length of 1, pointing in some direction. But for a maximally mixed state like this, it's at the center, so r is zero vector.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the answer should be C.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a completely mixed state for a qubit, where the system is equally likely to be in the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\). To determine its geometrical position in the qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch vector \(r = [x, y, z]\) corresponds to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices divided by 2. 

The density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + r_x \sigma_x + r_y \sigma_y + r_z \sigma_z \right),
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix and \(\sigma_x\), \(\sigma_y\), \(\sigma_z\) are the Pauli matrices. For the given \(\rho\), expanding it shows that the coefficients of the Pauli matrices are zero, meaning \(r_x = r_y = r_z = 0\). Thus, the Bloch vector is \(r = (0, 0, 0)\), corresponding to the origin in the Bloch sphere. This represents a maximally mixed state.

Among the options provided, the correct geometrical position is:

**A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\):** Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state with non-zero Bloch vector components.  
**B) \(r = (0, 0, 1):** Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state along the \(z\)-axis.  
**C) \(r = (0, 0, 0):** Correct, as this represents the origin in the Bloch sphere for a maximally mixed state.  
**D) \(r = (1, 1, 1):** Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state with non-zero Bloch vector components.
