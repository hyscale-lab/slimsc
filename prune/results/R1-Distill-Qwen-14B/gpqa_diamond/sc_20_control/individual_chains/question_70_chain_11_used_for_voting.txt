Okay, let me try to work through this chemistry problem. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it step by step.

So, the question is about a series of reactions, and ultimately, we need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are symmetry groups: C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

First, I'll try to outline what each reaction is telling me.

The first reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Hmm, 8 equivalents suggest a ratio of 1:8, but I'm not sure yet. Bright red product... that makes me think of something like sulfur or maybe a metal oxide. Wait, another bright red compound is mercury(I) oxide, but that's maybe not right here. Alternatively, maybe it's lead dioxide, PbO2, but that's dark brown perhaps. Or maybe something else. Wait, another thought: maybe it's a transition metal with a high oxidation state. For example, potassium permanganate is purple, not red. Wait, what about something like MnO2? No, that's dark. Alternatively, maybe the product is a sulfide? Or perhaps it's a nitride? Not sure yet.

Wait, but let's go to the next reaction. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to form product E, which is extremely hazardous. Then, when C reacts with water, it produces A plus two different acids F and G, where F is a strong acid and G is weak. So, that gives me a clue about the composition of C.

When C reacts with water, it could be a decomposition reaction. So, if C is a salt, perhaps when it reacts with water, it breaks down into the original metal (A) and acids. Since F is strong and G is weak, the acid formed from C's reaction with water is probably a metal salt that produces both H+ ions (from strong acid F) and some other ions (maybe a weak acid like HCN or something else).

Wait, another approach: Think about the reactions step by step. Let's try to assign possible compounds to A, B, C, etc.

First reaction: A + 8 B → C (bright red). Let's think about A as a metal. Maybe a transition metal. Let's say A is a metal like lead or mercury? Or maybe something else.

The second reaction: C + 2 D → E. D is a gas. Common gases are O2, H2, Cl2, SO2, etc. When C reacts with D, perhaps in a combustion reaction or some redox reaction.

Third reaction: C + H2O → A + F + G. Since F is a strong acid and G is weak, perhaps the decomposition of C produces a metal (A) and two acids. For example, if C is a metal oxide, then reacting with water would produce a metal hydroxide, but since it's producing acids, maybe C is a higher oxide, like a peroxide or something else.

Wait, another possibility: If C is a metal nitride, say, Mg3N2. When it reacts with water, it produces Mg(OH)2 and NH3 (but NH3 is a weak base, not acid). Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfide. For example, if A is a metal like Fe, but FeS reacting with water wouldn't produce acids. Wait, maybe C is a higher oxide, like PbO2. Wait, but earlier when A reacts with B to form C, maybe A is Pb and B is O2, but 8 equivalents would be a lot. Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal that forms a compound with a high oxidation state.

Wait, perhaps A is sulfur. Let's think: Sulfur (solid A) reacts with gas B to form product C. But what gas would that be? Maybe O2. So S + O2 → SO3? But wait, 8 equivalents of O2 would imply a high stoichiometry. Alternatively, maybe B is Cl2. Sulfur reacting with Cl2 gives SCl2 or SC2Cl4, etc. But I'm not sure about the products.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal that forms an oxide. Let's take copper as an example. Cu reacts with O2 to form CuO. But that's 1:1 ratio, not 8. So perhaps 8 equivalents is something else.

Wait, another thought: Maybe A is a metal like sodium. Sodium reacts with something. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the product C when reacting with water gives A and two acids. Let's think about a metal oxide. Suppose C is a metal oxide, perhaps a higher oxide like Mn2O7 or something else. When it reacts with water, it might decompose.

Wait, but more likely, maybe C is a compound that contains both a metal and oxygen in a way that when it reacts with water, it produces a metal (like A) and two acids. Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixture of two salts, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide and when it reacts with water, it forms the corresponding hydroxide. But then, how would that produce acids? Maybe not.

Wait, another angle: The fact that when C is treated with gas D, it produces E. D is a gas, perhaps H2 or Cl2. And E is extremely hazardous. So E could be a highly toxic gas, like Cl2O7? Or maybe HCl? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another possibility: Let's think about the common bright red compounds. One is mercury(I) oxide, Hg2O, but I'm not sure if it's red. Alternatively, perhaps it's lead oxide, but I think lead(II,IV) oxide is dark brown. Wait, maybe it's manganese(IV) oxide, MnO2, which is dark brown. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: Let's think about the reactions. The third reaction is C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, perhaps C is a salt that, when hydrolyzed, produces the metal (A) and two different acids.

Wait, if C is a sulfide, like FeS, but that doesn't produce acids on hydrolysis. Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride. For instance, if C is Mg3N2, adding water would produce Mg(OH)2 and NH3. But NH3 is a weak base, not acid. So that might not fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a peroxide. Let's say C is Na2O2. When Na2O2 reacts with water, it produces NaOH (strong base) and O2. But that doesn't fit the acids part. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe C is a metal carbonate. For example, CaCO3 reacts with water but doesn't produce acids. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a higher oxide. Take for example, K2Cr2O7 (potassium dichromate). It's orange, but when it reacts with water, it remains as is, perhaps not forming acids. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfite or something else. But I'm not getting much.

Let me think about the D gas. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So H is likely a common solvent. Water? No, because D and B combine to form H. Wait, H is a solvent. So possible solvents are ethanol, water, maybe something else.

Wait, if H is ethanol, then D and B would have to react to form ethanol. So, for example, if B is H2O and D is something else, but that's not a 1:1 ratio. Alternatively, if H is methanol, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: H is used as a solvent, like water? No, because D and B react to form H. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps B is H2O and D is something else. Wait, if B is H2O and D is another gas, perhaps CO2 or something. Wait, but I'm not making progress here.

Let me try another approach: Let's think about the possible symmetry groups of E. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

Well, D4h and D∞h are higher symmetry groups. For example, D4h is the symmetry group of the square planar molecule like XeF4, or perhaps something with a four-fold axis. D∞h is the symmetry of a linear molecule with inversion, like CO2 or H2O (though H2O is a bit different). Wait, no, H2O has C2v symmetry. CO2 is linear and has D∞h symmetry.

Wait, so if E is a linear molecule, maybe like CO2 or something else with D∞h symmetry.

Alternatively, if E is a molecule with a four-fold axis and other symmetry elements, perhaps something like SO2 has C2v symmetry.

Wait, let's think about E's possible identity. E is produced when C reacts with 2 equivalents of D. So, perhaps E is a gas, maybe a diatomic or triatomic molecule.

Wait, if E is a highly hazardous gas, perhaps something like chlorine trifluoride (ClF3), but I'm not sure about its symmetry. Alternatively, it could be a gas like phosgene (COCl2), but again, not sure about symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a compound like SO3, which is trigonal pyramidal and has C3v symmetry. But that's not one of the options here.

Wait, perhaps E is something like H2O or CO2. CO2 has D∞h symmetry, which is option C. H2O has C2v symmetry, option D. But I'm not sure which one fits.

Wait, let's try to think about the reactions again. Let me try to assign possible compounds.

First, solid A reacts with gas B (8 equivalents) to form bright red product C. Let's think about A as a metal, maybe V, and B as Cl2. So, vanadium reacts with Cl2 to form VCl4 or something. But what about the product's color?

Wait, vanadium(III, IV, V) chloride compounds can have various colors. Maybe VCl3 is green or something else. Alternatively, maybe A is a non-metal. Let's think about sulfur as A. Sulfur reacting with something to form a bright red product. Wait, when S reacts with Cl2, it forms SCl2, which is a bright yellow-red liquid. That's a possibility. So, S (solid A) reacts with Cl2 (gas B) to form SCl2 (product C). So the first reaction would be S + 8 Cl2 → SCl2? Wait, stoichiometry might not be correct here. Wait, the reaction of sulfur with Cl2 is S8 + 4 Cl2 → 4 S2Cl2. So maybe I'm off.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is S + O2 → SO3, but that's not likely. Or maybe S plus another gas.

Wait, if A is S, B is O2. Then, S reacts with O2 to form SO3. But SO3 is a colorless gas, not bright red. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal like iron. Fe reacts with Cl2 to form FeCl3, which is yellowish, not red. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is a metal oxide. For example, if A is lead, and B is oxygen, then Pb + O2 → PbO2, which is dark brown, not red.

Hmm, maybe I'm going down the wrong path. Let's try another approach.

The third reaction: C reacts with water to produce A, F, and G. So, perhaps C is a compound that when hydrolyzed gives the original metal, a strong acid, and a weak acid.

Suppose F is HCl (strong acid) and G is HCN (weak acid). Then, C would be something like KCN and HCl—no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps C is a cyanide salt. Let's say C is NaCN. When it reacts with water, it produces HCN (weak acid) and NaOH. But NaOH is a base, not an acid. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfide. For instance, if C is FeS, then reacting with water would produce Fe(OH)2 and H2S. But H2S is a weak acid, and Fe(OH)2 is a base. So F would be a strong acid, which doesn't fit because H2S is weak.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride, like Mg3N2. Reacting with water gives Mg(OH)2 and NH3. NH3 is a weak base, not acid.

Wait, perhaps C is a peroxide. Let's say C is Na2O2. Reacting with water produces NaOH (strong base) and O2. Not matching.

Hmm. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the fourth reaction: D and B react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. So, for example, if B is H2O and D is NH3, then H would be something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps B is H2O and D is something else. Wait, another possibility: B is H2O and D is NH3. Then, D and B could react to form something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps H is ethanol. Then, B and D would have to react to form ethanol. For example, if B is H2O and D is something like CO, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps B is H2O and D is something like SO2, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, suppose H is methanol. Then, maybe D is CO and B is H2O. CO + H2O → CH3OH? No, that's not a direct reaction. Perhaps via some catalyst, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps H is something like H2O. Then D and B would have to be two gases that react to form H2O. For example, H2 and O2 reacting to form H2O. So D is H2 and B is O2. Then, 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So that's a 1:1 ratio if considering the stoichiometric coefficients (2 H2 : 1 O2 → 2 H2O). So perhaps D is H2 and B is O2.

Wait, if B is O2, then in the first reaction, solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of O2 to form C. So, maybe A is a metal that forms a high oxidation state oxide. For example, copper doesn't react with O2 at room temperature. Lead? Lead can form PbO2, which is dark brown. Hmm.

Wait, but the product C is bright red. So maybe not PbO2. Another possibility: Maybe A is a metal that forms a +4 oxidation state oxide, which is red. For example, vanadium pentoxide is orange, not red. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe A is a non-metal. For instance, S8 (sulfur) reacts with O2 to form SO3. But SO3 is a colorless gas, not red.

Wait, perhaps A is a transition metal that forms a red oxide. Wait, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction isn't an oxide. Maybe it's a sulfide. For example, carbon (solid) reacting with Cl2 gas to form carbon tetrachloride. But carbon is solid, Cl2 is gas, but the product C would be CCl4, which is colorless. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction is solid A (like Na) reacting with Cl2 gas to form NaCl. But that's a 2:1 ratio. So 8 equivalents would mean 4 moles of Na for each mole of Cl2. But that doesn't make sense because the reaction is 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl.

Wait, the question states 8 equivalents of B. So, 8 times the moles of B per mole of A. So if A is 1 mole, B is 8 moles.

So in the first reaction, A + 8 B → C.

If B is Cl2, then 8 moles of Cl2 would mean A is a metal that reacts in an 8:1 ratio. Hmm, that's a lot.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal that forms a high oxidation state with Cl. For example, consider the reaction of aluminum with Cl2. The reaction is 2 Al + 3 Cl2 → 2 AlCl3. So that's 3 equivalents of Cl2 per 2 Al. Not 8.

Wait, another thought: Maybe B is O2. So, 8 O2 reacting with 1 A to form C.

So, perhaps A is a metal that forms a high oxidation state oxide. For example, lead forms PbO2 with O2. Let's see: 2 Pb + 5 O2 → 2 PbO2. So in this case, the ratio is 5 O2 per 2 Pb. So per mole of Pb, it's 2.5 O2. But in our first reaction, it's 8 equivalents, so 8 O2 per 1 A. So maybe A is a metal that reacts with more O2 per mole.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is 4 A + 8 B → 4 C? No, not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the possible reactions for each product.

The product E is formed when C reacts with 2 equivalents of D. Since E is extremely hazardous, perhaps E is a toxic gas or a highly reactive compound.

If D is a gas, maybe it's Cl2, but earlier I thought D is H2 if B is O2. Alternatively, perhaps D is Cl2, and B is something else.

Wait, let me try to think about the possible compounds again.

Because C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G a weak acid. So, perhaps C is a salt that when hydrolyzed produces the metal, a strong acid, and a weak acid.

Wait, maybe C is a mixture of two salts. Alternatively, perhaps C is a compound that contains both a metal and an anion that can form strong and weak acids when hydrolyzed.

Another angle: Suppose C is a nitrate salt. When it reacts with water, it might hydrolyze into a metal hydroxide and nitric acid. But nitric acid is a strong acid, but where does the weak acid come in? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate. But carbonate on hydrolysis would produce CO2 and the metal hydroxide, but that's not two acids.

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is a sulfite. For example, Na2SO3. When it reacts with water, it might hydrolyze to form NaOH and H2SO3 (which is a weak acid). But again, not two acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixed salt, like a nitro compound. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a peroxide that when hydrolyzed produces a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, suppose C is Na2O2. When it reacts with water, it produces NaOH (strong base) and O2. But that doesn't fit because F and G are acids.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck here. Let me think about the fourth reaction again. D and B react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So, if B is O2, then D could be something that reacts with O2 to form a solvent. For example, D could be H2, reacting with O2 to form H2O, which is a solvent. But then H would be H2O, but that's a product, not a reactant.

Wait, no, in the fourth reaction, D and B form H. So D and B are reactants, producing H, a solvent. If H is ethanol, perhaps D is CO and B is H2O, but I'm not sure about the reaction.

Wait, perhaps D is CO2 and B is H2O. Then, reacting in a 1:1 ratio to form H. But what would that be? Maybe forming something like methanol, but I don't think CO2 and H2O react directly to form that.

Alternatively, maybe D is H2S and B is O2. They can react to form H2O and S, but that's probably not a solvent.

Wait, perhaps H is something like ethylene glycol. But I'm not sure how that would form from D and B.

Alternatively, perhaps H is CH3OH (methanol). Suppose D is CH3O- and B is H+? Not sure.

Wait, maybe D is NH3 and B is H2O. Then, NH3 and H2O can react to form NH4OH (which is a weak acid), but that's not a solvent in itself. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps D is HCl and B is NaOH. But that would produce NaCl and water, but that's not a solvent per se.

Wait, maybe I should think differently. Let's consider possible symmetry groups and see which E could have them.

Option C is D∞h. That's the symmetry of a linear molecule with inversion. So, E could be something like CO2, which is linear. Alternatively, H2O has C2v symmetry, so that would be option D.

Wait, but if E is something like CO2, which has D∞h symmetry, what reactions would lead to that?

Let me try to piece it together:

If E is CO2, then what's C and D?

So, C reacts with D (gas) to form CO2. Let's say D is O2. Then, C + 2 O2 → CO2. So, what is C? Let's think about what C could be. If C is a carbon-containing compound.

Wait, but earlier in the first reaction, solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form C. If B is O2, and A is carbon (solid), then C could be CO (carbon monoxide) or CO2. But the reaction would need to produce CO or CO2 in a bright red color.

Wait, CO is a gas, not solid. So maybe A is a metal that reacts with O2 to form a red oxide. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if C is a carbonate, but I'm not making progress.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider E as SO2. SO2 has D∞h symmetry because it's linear. Wait, no, SO2 is V-shaped, so it's a bent molecule with C2v symmetry. So its symmetry group is C2v, which is option D.

Hmm, but I'm not certain about that.

Alternatively, if E is O2, symmetry group is O2 (which is D∞h), but O2 is diatomic and has D∞h symmetry.

Wait, another possibility: E is Cl2O7, which is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry. Cl2O7 is a highly toxic gas, which fits the 'extremely hazardous' description.

So, if E is Cl2O7, then let's see the reactions.

C reacts with 2 D → Cl2O7.

So, what's D? Let's see: If D is Cl2, then C + 2 Cl2 → Cl2O7. That would make sense if C is O2. Because O2 + 2 Cl2 → Cl2O7? Wait, no, that's not a standard reaction. Alternatively, perhaps C is ClO2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is ClO, and D is Cl2. Then, ClO + 2 Cl2 → Cl2O7? I'm not sure about the stoichiometry, but let's suppose that's possible.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look at the other clues.

When C reacts with H2O, it produces A, F, and G, where F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid.

If C is ClO2, reacting with water might produce HClO (weak acid) and possibly ClO- (which could form a base). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, if C is Cl2O, then reacting with water could produce HClO and HCl (strong acid). So, F is HCl, strong acid, and G is HClO, weak acid. That fits.

So, C is Cl2O. Now, what's the first reaction? Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of B to form C (Cl2O).

If B is O2, then perhaps A is Cl2. Because when Cl2 reacts with O2, it forms ClO2 or Cl2O. Wait, the reaction of Cl2 with O2 under certain conditions can produce ClO2, but I'm not sure about the stoichiometry.

Alternatively, maybe A is ClO2, but that seems like it's getting more complicated.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal like sodium. Then, Na (solid A) reacts with O2 (gas B) to form NaO2? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal oxide that reacts with another gas.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about symmetry groups again.

If E is Cl2O7, which is linear, then its symmetry group is D∞h (option C). Alternatively, if E is CO2, also linear, so D∞h.

But earlier I thought about CO2 in the context of E. So, let's see.

If E is CO2, then what's C and D? C must react with D (a gas) to form CO2.

Suppose C is CO and D is O2. Then, the reaction would be 2 CO + O2 → 2 CO2. So, 2 equivalents of O2 per mole of CO. But in the problem, C reacts with 2 equivalents of D, so it fits if the stoichiometry is 2 D per C.

So, 2 D → CO2? Let me think. If C is CO, then 2 D is O2, leading to CO2. That would make D as O2, and C as CO.

Then, in the first reaction, A reacts with 8 B to form C (CO). So, A is a solid, B is a gas.

What reacts to form CO? Maybe carbon (solid) reacting with O2 (gas) in a 8:1 ratio. But the reaction of carbon with O2 is C + O2 → CO2. But that's not CO.

Wait, perhaps C is CO. So, the first reaction would be A + 8 B → CO. What reaction could that be?

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal carbonyl. For example, nickel carbonyl is Ni(CO)4, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps A is iron and B is CO. Then, Fe reacts with CO to form Fe(CO)5. But that's a low oxidation state and doesn't involve O2.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to sum up.

If E is CO2, which has D∞h symmetry, then the answer would be option C. Alternatively, if E is something else, like SO2, which has C2v symmetry (option D), then that would be the answer.

But how do I decide which is more likely?

Looking back, the third reaction: C reacts with water to produce A, F, and G. If C is CO, then reacting with water would produce what? CO is unreactive towards water under normal conditions. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, if C is Cl2O, reacting with water would produce HClO (weak acid) and HCl (strong acid), which fits F and G.

So, C is Cl2O. Then, E is Cl2O7, formed when C reacts with 2 equivalents of D (Cl2).

Cl2O + 2 Cl2 → Cl2O7. That reaction is possible, I think.

Now, what's the symmetry group of Cl2O7? Cl2O7 is a linear molecule, with two Cl atoms on either side of O. So, it's linear and has D∞h symmetry.

So, E is Cl2O7, symmetry group D∞h, which is option C.

Wait, but earlier I thought Cl2O7 is a possible E, but let's make sure.

Another possibility: If E is O2, which is diatomic, so D∞h symmetry, which is option C.

But how would that fit?

C could be O3 (ozone), which reacts with D (O2) to form O2. But that would be a decomposition reaction, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is O2, but I'm not sure about the reactions.

Alternatively, let me think about the first reaction again. If A is ClO2, and B is something else.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal in a lower oxidation state, and B is O2. So, when A reacts with O2, it forms C, which is a higher oxidation state.

But this is getting too vague. I think I need to make a decision based on the symmetry groups and possible products.

If E has D∞h symmetry, which is the case for linear molecules like CO2, Cl2O7, O2, etc., then the answer would be C.

Alternatively, if E has C2v symmetry, like SO2, that would be option D.

But given the reactions, I think E is Cl2O7, which is linear and has D∞h symmetry. So, the answer should be C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a series of reactions leading to the identification of the molecular symmetry group of product E. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.  
   - The bright red color suggests a compound like a high oxidation state oxide or a sulfide. However, the exact identity of A and B remains unclear.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to form E, described as extremely hazardous.  
   - E is likely a highly toxic gas or compound. Possibilities include Cl₂O₇, SO₂, or CO₂, which are hazardous and have distinct symmetry groups.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to produce A, a strong acid F, and a weak acid G.  
   - This suggests C is a compound that hydrolyzes to form acids. For example, if C is Cl₂O, it could hydrolyze to form HCl (strong acid) and HClO (weak acid).

4. **Reaction 4**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent.  
   - This provides a clue about the identity of D and B. For instance, if B is O₂ and D is Cl₂, they could combine to form Cl₂O₇.

5. **Symmetry Analysis**:  
   - The symmetry group of E depends on its structure.  
   - If E is Cl₂O₇, it is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry.  
   - If E is CO₂, it is also linear with D∞h symmetry.  
   - If E is SO₂, it is bent with C2v symmetry.  

6. **Conclusion**: Based on the reactions and the hazardous nature of E, Cl₂O₇ is a plausible candidate. It is linear and has D∞h symmetry. Therefore, the molecular symmetry group of E is **D∞h**.

Answer: C

Okay, let me try to work through this chemistry problem. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it step by step.

So, the question is about a series of reactions, and ultimately, we need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are symmetry groups: C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

First, I'll try to outline what each reaction is telling me.

The first reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Hmm, 8 equivalents suggest a ratio of 1:8, but I'm not sure yet. Bright red product... that makes me think of something like sulfur or maybe a metal oxide. Wait, another bright red compound is mercury(I) oxide, but that's maybe not right here. Alternatively, maybe it's lead dioxide, PbO2, but that's dark brown perhaps. Or maybe something else. Wait, another thought: maybe it's a transition metal with a high oxidation state. For example, potassium permanganate is purple, not red. Wait, what about something like MnO2? No, that's dark. Alternatively, maybe the product is a sulfide? Or perhaps it's a nitride? Not sure yet.

Wait, but let's go to the next reaction. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to form product E, which is extremely hazardous. Then, when C reacts with water, it produces A plus two different acids F and G, where F is a strong acid and G is weak. So, that gives me a clue about the composition of C.

When C reacts with water, it could be a decomposition reaction. So, if C is a salt, perhaps when it reacts with water, it breaks down into the original metal (A) and acids. Since F is strong and G is weak, the acid formed from C's reaction with water is probably a metal salt that produces both H+ ions (from strong acid F) and some other ions (maybe a weak acid like HCN or something else).

Wait, another approach: Think about the reactions step by step. Let's try to assign possible compounds to A, B, C, etc.

First reaction: A + 8 B → C (bright red). Let's think about A as a metal. Maybe a transition metal. Let's say A is a metal like lead or mercury? Or maybe something else.

The second reaction: C + 2 D → E. D is a gas. Common gases are O2, H2, Cl2, SO2, etc. When C reacts with D, perhaps in a combustion reaction or some redox reaction.

Third reaction: C + H2O → A + F + G. Since F is a strong acid and G is weak, perhaps the decomposition of C produces a metal (A) and two acids. For example, if C is a metal oxide, then reacting with water would produce a metal hydroxide, but since it's producing acids, maybe C is a higher oxide, like a peroxide or something else.

Wait, another possibility: If C is a metal nitride, say, Mg3N2. When it reacts with water, it produces Mg(OH)2 and NH3 (but NH3 is a weak base, not acid). Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfide. For example, if A is a metal like Fe, but FeS reacting with water wouldn't produce acids. Wait, maybe C is a higher oxide, like PbO2. Wait, but earlier when A reacts with B to form C, maybe A is Pb and B is O2, but 8 equivalents would be a lot. Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal that forms a compound with a high oxidation state.

Wait, perhaps A is sulfur. Let's think: Sulfur (solid A) reacts with gas B to form product C. But what gas would that be? Maybe O2. So S + O2 → SO3? But wait, 8 equivalents of O2 would imply a high stoichiometry. Alternatively, maybe B is Cl2. Sulfur reacting with Cl2 gives SCl2 or SC2Cl4, etc. But I'm not sure about the products.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal that forms an oxide. Let's take copper as an example. Cu reacts with O2 to form CuO. But that's 1:1 ratio, not 8. So perhaps 8 equivalents is something else.

Wait, another thought: Maybe A is a metal like sodium. Sodium reacts with something. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the product C when reacting with water gives A and two acids. Let's think about a metal oxide. Suppose C is a metal oxide, perhaps a higher oxide like Mn2O7 or something else. When it reacts with water, it might decompose.

Wait, but more likely, maybe C is a compound that contains both a metal and oxygen in a way that when it reacts with water, it produces a metal (like A) and two acids. Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixture of two salts, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide and when it reacts with water, it forms the corresponding hydroxide. But then, how would that produce acids? Maybe not.

Wait, another angle: The fact that when C is treated with gas D, it produces E. D is a gas, perhaps H2 or Cl2. And E is extremely hazardous. So E could be a highly toxic gas, like Cl2O7? Or maybe HCl? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another possibility: Let's think about the common bright red compounds. One is mercury(I) oxide, Hg2O, but I'm not sure if it's red. Alternatively, perhaps it's lead oxide, but I think lead(II,IV) oxide is dark brown. Wait, maybe it's manganese(IV) oxide, MnO2, which is dark brown. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: Let's think about the reactions. The third reaction is C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, perhaps C is a salt that, when hydrolyzed, produces the metal (A) and two different acids.

Wait, if C is a sulfide, like FeS, but that doesn't produce acids on hydrolysis. Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride. For instance, if C is Mg3N2, adding water would produce Mg(OH)2 and NH3. But NH3 is a weak base, not acid. So that might not fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a peroxide. Let's say C is Na2O2. When Na2O2 reacts with water, it produces NaOH (strong base) and O2. But that doesn't fit the acids part. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe C is a metal carbonate. For example, CaCO3 reacts with water but doesn't produce acids. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a higher oxide. Take for example, K2Cr2O7 (potassium dichromate). It's orange, but when it reacts with water, it remains as is, perhaps not forming acids. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfite or something else. But I'm not getting much.

Let me think about the D gas. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So H is likely a common solvent. Water? No, because D and B combine to form H. Wait, H is a solvent. So possible solvents are ethanol, water, maybe something else.

Wait, if H is ethanol, then D and B would have to react to form ethanol. So, for example, if B is H2O and D is something else, but that's not a 1:1 ratio. Alternatively, if H is methanol, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: H is used as a solvent, like water? No, because D and B react to form H. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps B is H2O and D is something else. Wait, if B is H2O and D is another gas, perhaps CO2 or something. Wait, but I'm not making progress here.

Let me try another approach: Let's think about the possible symmetry groups of E. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

Well, D4h and D∞h are higher symmetry groups. For example, D4h is the symmetry group of the square planar molecule like XeF4, or perhaps something with a four-fold axis. D∞h is the symmetry of a linear molecule with inversion, like CO2 or H2O (though H2O is a bit different). Wait, no, H2O has C2v symmetry. CO2 is linear and has D∞h symmetry.

Wait, so if E is a linear molecule, maybe like CO2 or something else with D∞h symmetry.

Alternatively, if E is a molecule with a four-fold axis and other symmetry elements, perhaps something like SO2 has C2v symmetry.

Wait, let's think about E's possible identity. E is produced when C reacts with 2 equivalents of D. So, perhaps E is a gas, maybe a diatomic or triatomic molecule.

Wait, if E is a highly hazardous gas, perhaps something like chlorine trifluoride (ClF3), but I'm not sure about its symmetry. Alternatively, it could be a gas like phosgene (COCl2), but again, not sure about symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a compound like SO3, which is trigonal pyramidal and has C3v symmetry. But that's not one of the options here.

Wait, perhaps E is something like H2O or CO2. CO2 has D∞h symmetry, which is option C. H2O has C2v symmetry, option D. But I'm not sure which one fits.

Wait, let's try to think about the reactions again. Let me try to assign possible compounds.

First, solid A reacts with gas B (8 equivalents) to form bright red product C. Let's think about A as a metal, maybe V, and B as Cl2. So, vanadium reacts with Cl2 to form VCl4 or something. But what about the product's color?

Wait, vanadium(III, IV, V) chloride compounds can have various colors. Maybe VCl3 is green or something else. Alternatively, maybe A is a non-metal. Let's think about sulfur as A. Sulfur reacting with something to form a bright red product. Wait, when S reacts with Cl2, it forms SCl2, which is a bright yellow-red liquid. That's a possibility. So, S (solid A) reacts with Cl2 (gas B) to form SCl2 (product C). So the first reaction would be S + 8 Cl2 → SCl2? Wait, stoichiometry might not be correct here. Wait, the reaction of sulfur with Cl2 is S8 + 4 Cl2 → 4 S2Cl2. So maybe I'm off.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is S + O2 → SO3, but that's not likely. Or maybe S plus another gas.

Wait, if A is S, B is O2. Then, S reacts with O2 to form SO3. But SO3 is a colorless gas, not bright red. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal like iron. Fe reacts with Cl2 to form FeCl3, which is yellowish, not red. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is a metal oxide. For example, if A is lead, and B is oxygen, then Pb + O2 → PbO2, which is dark brown, not red.

Hmm, maybe I'm going down the wrong path. Let's try another approach.

The third reaction: C reacts with water to produce A, F, and G. So, perhaps C is a compound that when hydrolyzed gives the original metal, a strong acid, and a weak acid.

Suppose F is HCl (strong acid) and G is HCN (weak acid). Then, C would be something like KCN and HCl—no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps C is a cyanide salt. Let's say C is NaCN. When it reacts with water, it produces HCN (weak acid) and NaOH. But NaOH is a base, not an acid. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfide. For instance, if C is FeS, then reacting with water would produce Fe(OH)2 and H2S. But H2S is a weak acid, and Fe(OH)2 is a base. So F would be a strong acid, which doesn't fit because H2S is weak.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride, like Mg3N2. Reacting with water gives Mg(OH)2 and NH3. NH3 is a weak base, not acid.

Wait, perhaps C is a peroxide. Let's say C is Na2O2. Reacting with water produces NaOH (strong base) and O2. Not matching.

Hmm. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the fourth reaction: D and B react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. So, for example, if B is H2O and D is NH3, then H would be something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps B is H2O and D is something else. Wait, another possibility: B is H2O and D is NH3. Then, D and B could react to form something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps H is ethanol. Then, B and D would have to react to form ethanol. For example, if B is H2O and D is something like CO, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps B is H2O and D is something like SO2, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, suppose H is methanol. Then, maybe D is CO and B is H2O. CO + H2O → CH3OH? No, that's not a direct reaction. Perhaps via some catalyst, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps H is something like H2O. Then D and B would have to be two gases that react to form H2O. For example, H2 and O2 reacting to form H2O. So D is H2 and B is O2. Then, 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So that's a 1:1 ratio if considering the stoichiometric coefficients (2 H2 : 1 O2 → 2 H2O). So perhaps D is H2 and B is O2.

Wait, if B is O2, then in the first reaction, solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of O2 to form C. So, maybe A is a metal that forms a high oxidation state oxide. For example, copper doesn't react with O2 at room temperature. Lead? Lead can form PbO2, which is dark brown. Hmm.

Wait, but the product C is bright red. So maybe not PbO2. Another possibility: Maybe A is a metal that forms a +4 oxidation state oxide, which is red. For example, vanadium pentoxide is orange, not red. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe A is a non-metal. For instance, S8 (sulfur) reacts with O2 to form SO3. But SO3 is a colorless gas, not red.

Wait, perhaps A is a transition metal that forms a red oxide. Wait, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction isn't an oxide. Maybe it's a sulfide. For example, carbon (solid) reacting with Cl2 gas to form carbon tetrachloride. But carbon is solid, Cl2 is gas, but the product C would be CCl4, which is colorless. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction is solid A (like Na) reacting with Cl2 gas to form NaCl. But that's a 2:1 ratio. So 8 equivalents would mean 4 moles of Na for each mole of Cl2. But that doesn't make sense because the reaction is 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl.

Wait, the question states 8 equivalents of B. So, 8 times the moles of B per mole of A. So if A is 1 mole, B is 8 moles.

So in the first reaction, A + 8 B → C.

If B is Cl2, then 8 moles of Cl2 would mean A is a metal that reacts in an 8:1 ratio. Hmm, that's a lot.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal that forms a high oxidation state with Cl. For example, consider the reaction of aluminum with Cl2. The reaction is 2 Al + 3 Cl2 → 2 AlCl3. So that's 3 equivalents of Cl2 per 2 Al. Not 8.

Wait, another thought: Maybe B is O2. So, 8 O2 reacting with 1 A to form C.

So, perhaps A is a metal that forms a high oxidation state oxide. For example, lead forms PbO2 with O2. Let's see: 2 Pb + 5 O2 → 2 PbO2. So in this case, the ratio is 5 O2 per 2 Pb. So per mole of Pb, it's 2.5 O2. But in our first reaction, it's 8 equivalents, so 8 O2 per 1 A. So maybe A is a metal that reacts with more O2 per mole.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is 4 A + 8 B → 4 C? No, not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the possible reactions for each product.

The product E is formed when C reacts with 2 equivalents of D. Since E is extremely hazardous, perhaps E is a toxic gas or a highly reactive compound.

If D is a gas, maybe it's Cl2, but earlier I thought D is H2 if B is O2. Alternatively, perhaps D is Cl2, and B is something else.

Wait, let me try to think about the possible compounds again.

Because C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G a weak acid. So, perhaps C is a salt that when hydrolyzed produces the metal, a strong acid, and a weak acid.

Wait, maybe C is a mixture of two salts. Alternatively, perhaps C is a compound that contains both a metal and an anion that can form strong and weak acids when hydrolyzed.

Another angle: Suppose C is a nitrate salt. When it reacts with water, it might hydrolyze into a metal hydroxide and nitric acid. But nitric acid is a strong acid, but where does the weak acid come in? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate. But carbonate on hydrolysis would produce CO2 and the metal hydroxide, but that's not two acids.

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is a sulfite. For example, Na2SO3. When it reacts with water, it might hydrolyze to form NaOH and H2SO3 (which is a weak acid). But again, not two acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixed salt, like a nitro compound. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a peroxide that when hydrolyzed produces a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, suppose C is Na2O2. When it reacts with water, it produces NaOH (strong base) and O2. But that doesn't fit because F and G are acids.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck here. Let me think about the fourth reaction again. D and B react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So, if B is O2, then D could be something that reacts with O2 to form a solvent. For example, D could be H2, reacting with O2 to form H2O, which is a solvent. But then H would be H2O, but that's a product, not a reactant.

Wait, no, in the fourth reaction, D and B form H. So D and B are reactants, producing H, a solvent. If H is ethanol, perhaps D is CO and B is H2O, but I'm not sure about the reaction.

Wait, perhaps D is CO2 and B is H2O. Then, reacting in a 1:1 ratio to form H. But what would that be? Maybe forming something like methanol, but I don't think CO2 and H2O react directly to form that.

Alternatively, maybe D is H2S and B is O2. They can react to form H2O and S, but that's probably not a solvent.

Wait, perhaps H is something like ethylene glycol. But I'm not sure how that would form from D and B.

Alternatively, perhaps H is CH3OH (methanol). Suppose D is CH3O- and B is H+? Not sure.

Wait, maybe D is NH3 and B is H2O. Then, NH3 and H2O can react to form NH4OH (which is a weak acid), but that's not a solvent in itself. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps D is HCl and B is NaOH. But that would produce NaCl and water, but that's not a solvent per se.

Wait, maybe I should think differently. Let's consider possible symmetry groups and see which E could have them.

Option C is D∞h. That's the symmetry of a linear molecule with inversion. So, E could be something like CO2, which is linear. Alternatively, H2O has C2v symmetry, so that would be option D.

Wait, but if E is something like CO2, which has D∞h symmetry, what reactions would lead to that?

Let me try to piece it together:

If E is CO2, then what's C and D?

So, C reacts with D (gas) to form CO2. Let's say D is O2. Then, C + 2 O2 → CO2. So, what is C? Let's think about what C could be. If C is a carbon-containing compound.

Wait, but earlier in the first reaction, solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form C. If B is O2, and A is carbon (solid), then C could be CO (carbon monoxide) or CO2. But the reaction would need to produce CO or CO2 in a bright red color.

Wait, CO is a gas, not solid. So maybe A is a metal that reacts with O2 to form a red oxide. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if C is a carbonate, but I'm not making progress.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider E as SO2. SO2 has D∞h symmetry because it's linear. Wait, no, SO2 is V-shaped, so it's a bent molecule with C2v symmetry. So its symmetry group is C2v, which is option D.

Hmm, but I'm not certain about that.

Alternatively, if E is O2, symmetry group is O2 (which is D∞h), but O2 is diatomic and has D∞h symmetry.

Wait, another possibility: E is Cl2O7, which is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry. Cl2O7 is a highly toxic gas, which fits the 'extremely hazardous' description.

So, if E is Cl2O7, then let's see the reactions.

C reacts with 2 D → Cl2O7.

So, what's D? Let's see: If D is Cl2, then C + 2 Cl2 → Cl2O7. That would make sense if C is O2. Because O2 + 2 Cl2 → Cl2O7? Wait, no, that's not a standard reaction. Alternatively, perhaps C is ClO2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is ClO, and D is Cl2. Then, ClO + 2 Cl2 → Cl2O7? I'm not sure about the stoichiometry, but let's suppose that's possible.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look at the other clues.

When C reacts with H2O, it produces A, F, and G, where F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid.

If C is ClO2, reacting with water might produce HClO (weak acid) and possibly ClO- (which could form a base). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, if C is Cl2O, then reacting with water could produce HClO and HCl (strong acid). So, F is HCl, strong acid, and G is HClO, weak acid. That fits.

So, C is Cl2O. Now, what's the first reaction? Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of B to form C (Cl2O).

If B is O2, then perhaps A is Cl2. Because when Cl2 reacts with O2, it forms ClO2 or Cl2O. Wait, the reaction of Cl2 with O2 under certain conditions can produce ClO2, but I'm not sure about the stoichiometry.

Alternatively, maybe A is ClO2, but that seems like it's getting more complicated.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal like sodium. Then, Na (solid A) reacts with O2 (gas B) to form NaO2? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal oxide that reacts with another gas.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about symmetry groups again.

If E is Cl2O7, which is linear, then its symmetry group is D∞h (option C). Alternatively, if E is CO2, also linear, so D∞h.

But earlier I thought about CO2 in the context of E. So, let's see.

If E is CO2, then what's C and D? C must react with D (a gas) to form CO2.

Suppose C is CO and D is O2. Then, the reaction would be 2 CO + O2 → 2 CO2. So, 2 equivalents of O2 per mole of CO. But in the problem, C reacts with 2 equivalents of D, so it fits if the stoichiometry is 2 D per C.

So, 2 D → CO2? Let me think. If C is CO, then 2 D is O2, leading to CO2. That would make D as O2, and C as CO.

Then, in the first reaction, A reacts with 8 B to form C (CO). So, A is a solid, B is a gas.

What reacts to form CO? Maybe carbon (solid) reacting with O2 (gas) in a 8:1 ratio. But the reaction of carbon with O2 is C + O2 → CO2. But that's not CO.

Wait, perhaps C is CO. So, the first reaction would be A + 8 B → CO. What reaction could that be?

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal carbonyl. For example, nickel carbonyl is Ni(CO)4, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps A is iron and B is CO. Then, Fe reacts with CO to form Fe(CO)5. But that's a low oxidation state and doesn't involve O2.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to sum up.

If E is CO2, which has D∞h symmetry, then the answer would be option C. Alternatively, if E is something else, like SO2, which has C2v symmetry (option D), then that would be the answer.

But how do I decide which is more likely?

Looking back, the third reaction: C reacts with water to produce A, F, and G. If C is CO, then reacting with water would produce what? CO is unreactive towards water under normal conditions. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, if C is Cl2O, reacting with water would produce HClO (weak acid) and HCl (strong acid), which fits F and G.

So, C is Cl2O. Then, E is Cl2O7, formed when C reacts with 2 equivalents of D (Cl2).

Cl2O + 2 Cl2 → Cl2O7. That reaction is possible, I think.

Now, what's the symmetry group of Cl2O7? Cl2O7 is a linear molecule, with two Cl atoms on either side of O. So, it's linear and has D∞h symmetry.

So, E is Cl2O7, symmetry group D∞h, which is option C.

Wait, but earlier I thought Cl2O7 is a possible E, but let's make sure.

Another possibility: If E is O2, which is diatomic, so D∞h symmetry, which is option C.

But how would that fit?

C could be O3 (ozone), which reacts with D (O2) to form O2. But that would be a decomposition reaction, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is O2, but I'm not sure about the reactions.

Alternatively, let me think about the first reaction again. If A is ClO2, and B is something else.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal in a lower oxidation state, and B is O2. So, when A reacts with O2, it forms C, which is a higher oxidation state.

But this is getting too vague. I think I need to make a decision based on the symmetry groups and possible products.

If E has D∞h symmetry, which is the case for linear molecules like CO2, Cl2O7, O2, etc., then the answer would be C.

Alternatively, if E has C2v symmetry, like SO2, that would be option D.

But given the reactions, I think E is Cl2O7, which is linear and has D∞h symmetry. So, the answer should be C.


The problem involves a series of reactions leading to the identification of the molecular symmetry group of product E. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.  
   - The bright red color suggests a compound like a high oxidation state oxide or a sulfide. However, the exact identity of A and B remains unclear.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to form E, described as extremely hazardous.  
   - E is likely a highly toxic gas or compound. Possibilities include Cl₂O₇, SO₂, or CO₂, which are hazardous and have distinct symmetry groups.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to produce A, a strong acid F, and a weak acid G.  
   - This suggests C is a compound that hydrolyzes to form acids. For example, if C is Cl₂O, it could hydrolyze to form HCl (strong acid) and HClO (weak acid).

4. **Reaction 4**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent.  
   - This provides a clue about the identity of D and B. For instance, if B is O₂ and D is Cl₂, they could combine to form Cl₂O₇.

5. **Symmetry Analysis**:  
   - The symmetry group of E depends on its structure.  
   - If E is Cl₂O₇, it is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry.  
   - If E is CO₂, it is also linear with D∞h symmetry.  
   - If E is SO₂, it is bent with C2v symmetry.  

6. **Conclusion**: Based on the reactions and the hazardous nature of E, Cl₂O₇ is a plausible candidate. It is linear and has D∞h symmetry. Therefore, the molecular symmetry group of E is **D∞h**.

Answer: C
