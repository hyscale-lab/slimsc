Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³. That's 200 mL, or 0.2 liters. The solution contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol, and Na2HPO4·2H2O is 177.99 g/mol. The temperature is 25°C. We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO4^2- or PO4^3-?), and the Ka values for H3PO4 are provided: Ka1=7.5e-3, Ka2=6.2e-8, Ka3=1.8e-12.

Wait, orthophosphate is usually PO4^3-, right? But sometimes HPO4^2- is also called orthophosphate. Hmm. I think in this context, it's referring to the PO4^3- ion. Because when dealing with the phosphate buffer system, HPO4^2- is the conjugate base of H2PO4^-.

So, the solution has two phosphate salts: KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. These are potassium hydrogen phosphate and disodium hydrogen phosphate (the latter with two waters of hydration). These should form a buffer solution because they are a weak acid and its conjugate base.

Wait, let me think. H3PO4 is a triprotic acid. It dissociates in three steps:

H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1)
H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2)
HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3)

So, the salts: KH2PO4 is a source of H2PO4^- (since it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-). Na2HPO4·2H2O would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So in solution, the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- will be present. The presence of both suggests a buffer solution between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, meaning we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH, which in turn can help us find the concentration of PO4^3-.

Wait, but the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated form, PO4^3-, right? So we need to find the concentration of PO4^3-.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the HPO4^2- as orthophosphate. I'm a bit confused about the terminology. Let me make sure.

Wait, the phosphate ion is PO4^3-, which is the orthophosphate ion. But in solution, it's in various protonated forms. So, H3PO4 is the fully protonated, H2PO4^- is dihydrogen phosphate, HPO4^2- is hydrogen phosphate, and PO4^3- is orthophosphate.

So the question is asking for the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, which is PO4^3-.

But wait, how much of that is present in the solution? Because HPO4^2- can further deprotonate to PO4^3-, but given the pH of the solution, which is determined by the buffer, we can calculate the amount of PO4^3-.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- will lead to some PO4^3- via the third dissociation step.

So, the plan is: first, calculate the moles of each salt. Then, find the concentrations of each ion in the solution. Then, use the buffer equation to find the pH, then use the third dissociation equation to find [PO4^3-].

Wait, but perhaps we can assume that the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and the pH is determined by the ratio of these two. Then, knowing the pH, we can calculate the concentration of PO4^3- using the third Ka.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate moles of each salt.
2. Find concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution.
3. Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH.
4. Use the third dissociation equation (Ka3) to find [PO4^3-].

Wait, but wait, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the second dissociation (since H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are involved) would give me the pH. Then, using that pH, I can find the concentration of PO4^3- from the HPO4^2-.

So, let's start with step 1.

Moles of KH2PO4: mass is 1.00 g, molecular weight 136.09 g/mol.

Moles = mass / Mw = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007343 mol.

Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O: mass 1.00 g, Mw=177.99 g/mol.

Moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005607 mol.

Wait, but each mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^-.

Each mole of Na2HPO4·2H2O gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

So, moles H2PO4^- = 0.007343 mol.

Moles HPO4^2- = 0.005607 mol.

But wait, the solution volume is 200 mL, so 0.2 L.

Concentration H2PO4^- = 0.007343 / 0.2 ≈ 0.036715 M.

Concentration HPO4^2- = 0.005607 / 0.2 ≈ 0.028035 M.

So, the ratio of [HPO4^2-] to [H2PO4^-] is approximately (0.028035)/(0.036715) ≈ 0.764.

Now, applying the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the second dissociation (Ka2):

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

We have the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] ≈ 0.764.

So, pH = pKa2 + log(0.764)

pKa2 is given as 6.2e-8, so pKa2 = log(1/(6.2e-8)).

Wait, pKa is -log(Ka). So,

Ka2 = 6.2e-8 → pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.207.

Wait, let me compute that accurately. Because 1e-7 is pH 7, and 6.2e-8 is a bit lower than 1e-7, so pKa would be around 7.207.

So, pH = 7.207 + log(0.764)

log(0.764) is negative. Let me compute it. log(0.764) ≈ log(7.64e-1) ≈ -0.115.

So, pH ≈ 7.207 - 0.115 ≈ 7.092.

So the pH is approximately 7.09.

Now, knowing the pH, we can find the concentration of PO4^3-.

The third dissociation is HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

At pH 7.09, the concentration of H+ is 10^(-7.09) ≈ 8.23e-8 M.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the third dissociation (but wait, that's the third dissociation, so the equation would be pH = pKa3 + log([PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]).

Wait, but since HPO4^2- is the acid here, and PO4^3- is its conjugate base. So the equation is:

pH = pKa3 + log([PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-])

We can rearrange this to find [PO4^3-].

pKa3 = -log(Ka3) = -log(1.8e-12) ≈ 11.74.

So,

pH = 11.74 + log([PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-])

We know pH is 7.09, so:

7.09 = 11.74 + log([PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-])

Subtract 11.74 from both sides:

7.09 - 11.74 = log([PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-])

-4.65 = log([PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-])

Taking antilog:

[PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-] = 10^(-4.65) ≈ 2.29e-5.

So,

[PO4^3-] = [HPO4^2-] * 2.29e-5.

We have [HPO4^2-] as approximately 0.028035 M.

So,

[PO4^3-] = 0.028035 * 2.29e-5 ≈ 6.406e-7 M.

Wait, let's compute that more accurately.

0.028035 * 2.29e-5.

0.028035 * 2.29e-5 = (2.8035e-2) * (2.29e-5) = (2.8035 * 2.29) * 1e-7.

2.8035 * 2.29 ≈ let's compute:

2.8 * 2.29 = approx 6.412.

Wait, 2.29 * 2.8035:

2 * 2.8035 = 5.607.

0.29 * 2.8035 = approx 0.813015.

Total: 5.607 + 0.813015 ≈ 6.420.

So 6.420e-7 M.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, D is 3.97e-7, etc. So 6.42e-7 is close to option A.

But wait, maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me check again.

Wait, let's redo the [PO4^3-] calculation.

[HPO4^2-] is 0.028035 M.

The ratio [PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-] is 2.29e-5, so [PO4^3-] = 0.028035 * 2.29e-5.

Compute 0.028035 * 2.29e-5:

0.028035 is 2.8035e-2.

Multiply 2.8035e-2 * 2.29e-5.

2.8035 * 2.29 = let me compute accurately.

2.8 * 2.29 = 6.412.

0.0035 *2.29 = 0.008.

So 6.412 + 0.008 = 6.420.

So 6.420e-7 M.

But wait, let me be precise.

2.8035e-2 * 2.29e-5 = (2.8035 * 2.29) * 1e-7.

2.8035 *2.29:

Let me compute this:

2.8035 * 2 = 5.607.

2.8035 * 0.29 = ?

Compute 2.8035 * 0.2 = 0.5607.

2.8035 * 0.09 = 0.252315.

So 0.5607 + 0.252315 = 0.813015.

So total: 5.607 + 0.813015 = 6.420015.

So, 6.420015e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close but not exactly matching. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in calculating the pH. Let's recheck that step.

Earlier step, I found the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.764.

Then, pH = pKa2 + log(0.764).

pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) ≈ ?

Let me compute pKa2 accurately.

Ka2 = 6.2e-8.

So pKa2 = log(1/(6.2e-8)) → wait, no, pKa is -log(Ka).

So pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) ≈ ?

Log(6.2e-8) = log(6.2) + log(1e-8) = 0.7924 -8 = -7.2076.

So pKa2 = 7.2076.

Then, log(0.764) is -0.115.

So pH = 7.2076 - 0.115 = 7.0926.

So pH ≈ 7.093.

Then, when using the third dissociation:

pH = pKa3 + log([PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-])

pKa3 = 11.74.

So, [PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-] = 10^(pH - pKa3) = 10^(7.093 -11.74) = 10^(-4.647).

Compute 10^(-4.647) = antilog(-4.647) = 2.27e-5.

So [PO4^3-] = [HPO4^2-] * 2.27e-5.

[HPO4^2-] is 0.028035 M.

Compute 0.028035 * 2.27e-5.

0.028035 * 2.27e-5 = ?

0.028035 is 2.8035e-2.

Multiply 2.8035e-2 * 2.27e-5 = (2.8035 * 2.27) * 1e-7.

2.8035 *2.27 = ?

2 * 2.27 = 4.54.

0.8035 * 2.27 = ?

Compute 0.8 * 2.27=1.816, 0.0035 *2.27=0.008. So total 1.816 +0.008=1.824.

So 4.54 +1.824=6.364.

So 6.364e-7 M.

Which is approximately 6.36e-7 M. The options are:

A) 6.24e-7

D) 3.97e-7

Hmm. So the closest is option A, but perhaps my calculations are missing something.

Wait, maybe the exact amount of HPO4^2- is more accurately computed.

Wait, let me re-calculate the moles.

KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol.

1.00 /136.09 = approximately 0.007343 mol.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 /177.99 = approximately 0.005607 mol.

So, [H2PO4^-] = 0.007343 / 0.2 = 0.036715 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005607 /0.2 = 0.028035 M.

So the ratio is 0.028035 /0.036715 = 0.764.

Henderson-Hasselbalch:

pH = pKa2 + log(0.764) → 7.2076 + (-0.115) = 7.0926.

Now, for the third dissociation:

PO4^3- comes from HPO4^2-.

The Ka3 is 1.8e-12. So, the expression is:

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]

We can rearrange to find [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

Because [H+] = 10^-pH = 10^-7.0926 ≈ 8.23e-8.

So,

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028035) / (8.23e-8)

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028035 ≈ 5.0463e-14.

Denominator: 8.23e-8.

So,

5.0463e-14 / 8.23e-8 = (5.0463 /8.23) * 1e-6.

5.0463 /8.23 ≈ 0.6129.

So, 0.6129e-6 = 6.129e-7 M.

So approximately 6.13e-7 M, which is close to option A (6.24e-7) but a bit lower.

Wait, perhaps more precise calculation.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028035 = ?

1.8 *0.028035 = 0.050463 → 0.050463e-12 = 5.0463e-14.

Denominator: [H+] = 10^-7.0926.

Compute 10^-7.0926.

We can compute 7.0926 as log(10^7.0926) = 10^7 * 10^0.0926 ≈ 10^7 * 1.238.

Wait, 10^0.0926 is approximately 1.238.

So 10^-7.0926 = 1/(10^0.0926 * 1e7) )= 1/(1.238e7) ≈ 8.075e-8.

So [H+] = 8.075e-8.

Thus,

[PO4^3-] = (5.0463e-14) / (8.075e-8) = (5.0463 / 8.075) * 1e-6.

5.0463 /8.075 ≈ 0.6253.

So, 0.6253e-6 = 6.253e-7 M.

Which is about 6.25e-7 M, very close to option A (6.24e-7 M). So the correct answer is option A.

To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the buffer system formed by KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The solution contains 1.00 g of each salt, and the molecular weights are given as 136.09 g/mol for KH₂PO₄ and 177.99 g/mol for Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³ (0.2 L). The dissociation constants for H₃PO₄ are provided: Ka₁ = 7.5 × 10⁻³, Ka₂ = 6.2 × 10⁻⁸, and Ka₃ = 1.8 × 10⁻¹².

### Step 1: Calculate moles of each salt
- Moles of KH₂PO₄:  
  \[
  \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Weight}} = \frac{1.00}{136.09} \approx 0.007343 \, \text{mol}
  \]
  This contributes 0.007343 mol of H₂PO₄⁻.

- Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O:  
  \[
  \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Weight}} = \frac{1.00}{177.99} \approx 0.005607 \, \text{mol}
  \]
  This contributes 0.005607 mol of HPO₄²⁻.

### Step 2: Calculate concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻
The total volume of the solution is 0.2 L. Thus:
- \[
  [\text{H₂PO₄⁻}] = \frac{\text{Moles of H₂PO₄⁻}}{\text{Volume}} = \frac{0.007343}{0.2} \approx 0.036715 \, \text{M}
  \]
- \[
  [\text{HPO₄²⁻}] = \frac{\text{Moles of HPO₄²⁻}}{\text{Volume}} = \frac{0.005607}{0.2} \approx 0.028035 \, \text{M}
  \]

### Step 3: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH
The buffer system involves H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, corresponding to the second dissociation of H₃PO₄ (Ka₂ = 6.2 × 10⁻⁸). The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is:
\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa}_2 + \log\left(\frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]}\right)
\]
- \(\text{pKa}_2 = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.207\)
- \(\frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]} = \frac{0.028035}{0.036715} \approx 0.764\)

Substitute into the equation:
\[
\text{pH} = 7.207 + \log(0.764) \approx 7.207 - 0.115 = 7.092
\]

### Step 4: Use the third dissociation to find [PO₄³⁻]
The third dissociation of H₃PO₄ involves HPO₄²⁻:
\[
\text{HPO₄²⁻} \leftrightarrow \text{H⁺} + \text{PO₄³⁻}
\]
The equilibrium constant is:
\[
K_a3 = \frac{[\text{H⁺}][\text{PO₄³⁻}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}
\]
Rearranging for \([\text{PO₄³⁻}]\):
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{K_a3 \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H⁺}]}
\]
- \([\text{H⁺}] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.092} \approx 8.23 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}\)
- \([\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.028035)}{8.23 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\)

### Final Answer:
The concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution is approximately **6.24 × 10⁻⁷ M**.

**Answer: A**
