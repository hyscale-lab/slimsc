Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle. Hmm, I remember that Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position and momentum. The question is asking about the minimum uncertainty in the energy of an electron. Let me think through this step by step.

The problem states that the electron is moving at a speed v of 2*10^8 m/s along the x-direction, and the uncertainty in its position Δx is 0.1 nm. Oh wait, 0.1 nm is 0.1 nanometers, which is 1e-10 meters. Right, because 1 nm is 1e-9 meters, so 0.1 nm is 1e-10.

So the formula I need here is the Uncertainty Principle: Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. But since we're looking for the minimum uncertainty, I can set it equal to ħ/2. That makes sense because the principle gives a lower bound.

Wait, but what's Δp? Oh right, Δp is the uncertainty in momentum. And momentum p is mass times velocity. Since the electron is moving at speed v, but the uncertainty in velocity? Hmm, wait no, the question doesn't give an uncertainty in velocity. Oh wait, how does this tie in?

Wait, wait. The Uncertainty Principle connects position and momentum. So if we have Δx, we can find Δp, and then relate that to the uncertainty in energy.

But I'm a bit confused because the electron's speed is given. Oh, wait, but in this context, when we talk about the uncertainty in momentum, do we assume that the uncertainty comes from the position uncertainty? Because the speed is given, but perhaps the momentum's uncertainty is related to the position's uncertainty via the Uncertainty Principle.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The momentum of the electron is p = m*v. But since we're dealing with uncertainties, the uncertainty in momentum Δp will come from the uncertainty in position, right? Because Δp is roughly m * Δv, but perhaps in this case, since the speed is given, maybe the velocity is known precisely, so the uncertainty in velocity Δv is zero? That doesn't seem right.

Wait, no. No, the problem doesn't specify anything about the uncertainty in velocity. So perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the uncertainty in momentum is calculated using the position uncertainty. So Δp = ħ/(2Δx). Because from the Uncertainty Principle, Δx Δp ≈ ħ/2.

So, let's calculate Δp. The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So Δp = ħ / (2Δx) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 1e-10) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-10) = 5.27e-25 kg·m/s. Wait, let me compute that properly.

Wait, 2Δx is 2e-10 meters. So 1.05e-34 / (2e-10) is (1.05/2) * 1e-24, which is 0.525e-24, which is 5.25e-25 kg·m/s. So Δp ≈ 5.25e-25 kg m/s.

Now, to find the uncertainty in energy ΔE. Hmm, how is energy related to momentum? For a particle moving at relativistic speeds, the total energy is given by the relativistic equation, but electrons at 2e8 m/s... Wait, what's the speed of light? Approximately 3e8 m/s. So 2e8 is about two-thirds the speed of light. That's relativistic, so I might need to use the relativistic energy formula.

Wait, but the speed isn't that close to c, perhaps non-relativistic would be okay. Let me check. Let's compute the relativistic gamma factor. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So v=2e8 m/s, c=3e8.

v² = (2e8)^2 = 4e16. c^2 is 9e16. So v²/c² is 4/9 = 0.444. So sqrt(1 - 0.444) is sqrt(0.556) ≈ 0.745. So gamma is 1/0.745 ≈ 1.34. Hmm, so the non-relativistic approximation might not be so great, but perhaps for an order of magnitude estimate, it's manageable.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects a non-relativistic approach since it's an introductory problem. Let me think: in non-relativistic mechanics, the kinetic energy K is (p²)/(2m), where m is the mass of the electron.

So, if I calculate ΔK, which is the uncertainty in kinetic energy, that would be approximately (Δp)^2/(2m). So let's compute that.

Mass of electron m is about 9.109e-31 kg. So let me compute (5.25e-25)^2 / (2 * 9.109e-31).

Calculating numerator: (5.25e-25)^2 = (5.25)^2 * 1e-50 = 27.56e-50 = 2.756e-49. Divided by denominator: 2*9.109e-31 = 1.8218e-30. So 2.756e-49 / 1.8218e-30 = (2.756 / 1.8218) * 1e-19. 2.756 / 1.8218 ≈ 1.512. So approximately 1.512e-19 J. So about 1.5e-19 J.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is ~1e-19 J, which is close. But wait, let me think again because when using the Uncertainty Principle, the energy uncertainty is the uncertainty in kinetic energy, but in reality, energy uncertainty could be more accurately calculated using the relativistic formula. But let's see.

Alternatively, maybe we should consider the uncertainty in momentum and then the uncertainty in energy as the change in kinetic energy due to that uncertainty in momentum.

Wait, another approach: The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle also relates the energy-time uncertainty, but I think that's not directly applicable here. So perhaps the first approach is correct.

Wait, but in the given problem, the electron's speed is given, but not the uncertainty in speed. So perhaps the uncertainty in momentum comes only from the position uncertainty, as we calculated. So going back to the calculation, the uncertainty in kinetic energy is about 1.5e-19 J, which is around 1e-19 J, so option C.

Wait, but wait, let me recheck the numbers. Let me recompute the Δp.

Δp = ħ/(2Δx) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 1e-10) = 1.05e-34 / 2e-10 = (1.05 / 2) * 1e-24 = 0.525e-24 = 5.25e-25 kg m/s.

Yes, that's correct.

Then, ΔK = (Δp)^2/(2m) = (5.25e-25)^2 / (2 * 9.109e-31).

Compute numerator: (5.25e-25)^2 = (5.25)^2 = 27.56 → 27.56e-50.

Denominator: 2 * 9.109e-31 ≈ 1.8218e-30.

So 27.56e-50 / 1.8218e-30 = (27.56 / 1.8218) * 1e-20 = approx 15.12 * 1e-20 = 1.512e-19 J. So approximately 1.5e-19 J.

Looking at the options, option C is 1e-19 J, which is the closest. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the problem is asking for the uncertainty in energy, which could include rest mass energy, but in that case, the kinetic energy is much smaller than the rest mass energy. Let's check.

Rest mass energy of electron is m c^2 = 9.1e-31 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2 = 9.1e-31 * 9e16 = 8.19e-14 J. So 1.5e-19 J is way smaller than that. So the kinetic energy uncertainty is negligible compared to the rest mass energy, so the total energy uncertainty would be approximately the same as the kinetic energy uncertainty. So the initial approach is correct.

Another point: perhaps I should have used the relativistic expression for momentum, but I'm not sure. Let me think: if the speed is significant compared to c, then relativistic effects are important. But in the calculation earlier, gamma was about 1.34, which isn't too large, but perhaps the non-relativistic approach is still acceptable for an order of magnitude estimate.

Alternatively, perhaps using the relativistic energy would complicate things. Since the problem gives an option of ~1e-19 J, which is what I got, I think that's the right choice. So the answer should be C.

To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy \( \Delta E \) of an electron, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states:

\[
\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}
\]

Here, \( \Delta x = 0.1 \, \text{nm} = 1 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \), and \( \hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \). Solving for \( \Delta p \), the uncertainty in momentum:

\[
\Delta p = \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta x} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 1 \times 10^{-10}} = 5.27 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
\]

Next, we calculate the uncertainty in kinetic energy \( \Delta K \), which is related to the uncertainty in momentum by the non-relativistic formula:

\[
\Delta K = \frac{(\Delta p)^2}{2m},
\]

where \( m = 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \) is the mass of the electron. Substituting \( \Delta p = 5.27 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s} \):

\[
\Delta K = \frac{(5.27 \times 10^{-25})^2}{2 \times 9.109 \times 10^{-31}}.
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
(5.27 \times 10^{-25})^2 = (5.27)^2 \times 10^{-50} = 27.77 \times 10^{-50} = 2.777 \times 10^{-49}.
\]

Then, calculate the denominator:

\[
2 \times 9.109 \times 10^{-31} = 1.8218 \times 10^{-30}.
\]

Now, divide the two:

\[
\Delta K = \frac{2.777 \times 10^{-49}}{1.8218 \times 10^{-30}} = (2.777 / 1.8218) \times 10^{-19} \approx 1.525 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

Thus, the minimum uncertainty in energy \( \Delta E \) is approximately \( 1.5 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \), which is closest to the option \( \sim 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \).

The relativistic effects were considered, but since the speed \( v = 2 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) is not extremely close to the speed of light \( c \), the non-relativistic approximation is sufficient for this order-of-magnitude estimate. Additionally, the uncertainty in energy is much smaller than the rest mass energy of the electron, so it can be neglected.
