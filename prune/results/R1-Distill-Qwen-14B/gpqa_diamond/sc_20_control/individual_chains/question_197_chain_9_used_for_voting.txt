Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit unsure but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying the product formed when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The data given includes IR and NMR spectra, so I'll need to analyze those first to figure out what Compound X is.

Starting with the IR data: The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates an alkyne or an alkene, maybe an alcohol or something else. But wait, the 1720 cm-1 peak is a strong carbonyl (C=O), so that suggests a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 peaks could be from aromatic rings, possibly C=C stretching.

Looking at the NMR data: The 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet (bs) for 1H. That's quite a high chemical shift, possibly an aldehyde proton or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids usually show up around 10-12 ppm as a broad peak. However, looking at the options, some are acids and others aren't. Let's hold that thought.

The next peaks: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring. Like a benzene ring with two substituents opposite each other. The two doublets integrate to 2H each, so it's probably a para-disubstituted benzene, maybe with an electron-withdrawing group like a carbonyl on one substituent.

Then, 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH group adjacent to something electronegative, maybe a carbonyl. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) might be part of a chain, perhaps CH2 groups next to another CH or carbonyl. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) looks like a methyl group attached to something, maybe a CH that's next to a carbonyl. And the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is likely a terminal methyl group in a longer chain, like an ethyl or butyl group.

Putting this together, maybe the structure is something like a benzene ring with a substituent that has a carbonyl group and a chain attached. Let's think of the substituent as something like an ester or a ketone with an adjacent chain.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. That would have a benzene ring with an ethyl group in the para position, connected to a propionic acid. The NMR would have a broad peak for the carboxylic acid, which matches the 10.5 ppm. But wait, the IR has a peak at 1720, which for a carboxylic acid is a bit off because carboxylic acids typically have lower carbonyl peaks. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester. Hmm. Or maybe an acid. But let me think about other options.

Option C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That would have a benzene ring with a sec-butyl group in the para position and a carboxylic acid. So the benzoic acid group would explain the 1720 cm-1, but wait, benzoic acids have their carbonyl around 1700 cm-1. But that's close. The NMR would have a broad peak for the COOH, which fits the 10.5 ppm. The substituent would be a sec-butyl group. Let me see about the NMR shifts.

In the NMR, the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be the CH in the sec-butyl group (the part attached to the benzene). The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) would be the adjacent CH2 groups. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) would be the methyl groups attached to the CH (since sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)2 or wait, no. Wait, the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH2CH2CH3? Wait no, no. Wait, the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3) something? Let me correct that. The sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)2? No, wait, no. Wait, the correct structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but no, wait. Wait, wait. The butyl group: the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)- no, wait. Wait, butyl is -CH2CH2CH2CH3, but the substituent is on the second carbon. So the substituent is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-? No, wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the butyl group can be primary, secondary, or tertiary. For sec-butyl, it's CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but more accurately, it's -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3) where the CH(CH2CH3) is attached to the benzene ring. So the structure would be benzene with a substituent like CH(CH2CH2CH3)-. Wait, no. Let me draw it. The benzene ring has a substituent which is a butyl group attached via the second carbon. So the structure would be: benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but wait, no. Wait, the correct structure is benzene-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-, but that would be a branch. Alternatively, maybe it's benzene-CH(CH2CH2CH2)-, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps it's benzene with a substituent of -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. So the substituent is a three-carbon chain, where the middle carbon is connected to a methyl group. So the substituent is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- attached to benzene. Or wait, perhaps it's CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but that would be a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propanoic acid group attached to the benzene. So in the case of option A, it's 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. So the benzene ring has an ethyl group in the para position, and the propanoic acid is attached to the benzene as well? Or is the substituent propyl with a carboxylic acid?

Wait, the NMR for option A would have the benzene ring with two substituents? Because in the NMR, I see two doublets for the aromatic protons, which suggests a para substitution. So if the benzene is para-substituted, then the substituents are on opposite positions.

If the substituents are an ethyl group and a propionic acid, then the aromatic protons would be two sets of two, which matches the NMR data. Let's think. The aromatic region in the NMR is 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H), which is consistent with a para-substituted benzene with two different substituents. So if one substituent is an ethyl group (which is an electron-donating group, activating) and the other is a propionic acid (which is an electron-withdrawing group, deactivating), that would create two sets of aromatic protons.

But wait, the 10.5 ppm peak would be the acidic proton of the propionic acid, which would make sense. The IR would then have a carbonyl at 1720, which for a carboxylic acid is a bit low, but maybe possible. However, the presence of a strong carbonyl in IR is more typical for esters or ketones. But maybe in this case, it's a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, looking at option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That would have a benzene ring with a sec-butyl group and a carboxylic acid group in the para position. Wait, no. If it's 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, the benzoic acid is at position 4, and the substituent is a sec-butyl at position 4? Wait, that would be the same position, which isn't possible. Oh wait, no. Wait, the naming would be benzene ring with substituents at positions 1 and 4. So the benzoic acid is at position 1, and the sec-butyl is at position 4. So the benzene would have two substituents, a COOH and a sec-butyl group, in the para positions. Then, the aromatic protons would be split into two sets of doublets, which matches the NMR.

But wait, the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is more consistent with an ester or a ketone than a carboxylic acid. Because carboxylic acids typically have lower wavenumber for the carbonyl, around 1700 or so, but this is 1720, which is a bit higher. Alternatively, maybe it's an acid chloride, but that's not one of the options. So perhaps the compound isn't an acid.

Wait, going back to the IR. The peak at 3400–2500 cm-1 suggests either an alkyne (sp-hybridized C-H stretch) or an alkene (maybe with conjugated substituents). Alternatively, it could be an O-H stretch, but that's usually broader and appears in that region. For example, alcohol O-H or carboxylic acid O-H.

Wait, the NMR at 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet for 1H. That's more characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton. If it were an alcohol, the O-H would be a broad peak, but alcohols are usually at lower ppm, like 1-5 ppm. So 10.5 is higher, which points to a carboxylic acid.

But wait, if the compound was an ester, the IR carbonyl would be around 1740 cm-1, so 1720 is a bit lower than that. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone. If it were a ketone, then the NMR wouldn't have a proton at 10.5 ppm, because ketones don't have acidic protons. So that might not fit.

Another possibility is that the compound is an acyl chloride, but that's not one of the options. So perhaps the initial thought about a carboxylic acid is correct, despite the IR.

So looking back, the NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): COOH proton.
- 8.0 and 7.2 ppm: para disubstituted benzene.
- The lower ppm signals: 2.9, 1.7, 1.4, 0.9 ppm.

If the substituent is a sec-butyl group, then the structure would be benzene with a substituent like CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. Wait, no. The substituent is a sec-butyl, which is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but that's actually a tertiary substituent. Wait, no, wait. The structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene? No, wait, no. The correct structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

The butyl group is either primary, secondary, or tertiary. The primary is -CH2CH2CH2CH3, the secondary is -CH(CH2CH3)CH2, attached via the second carbon. So the substituent is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but that might not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps it's -CH(CH2CH2CH3)-, but that doesn't add up.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. For example, if it's a sec-butyl group, the structure would be -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, attached to the benzene. So the substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Then, the CH2 group is attached to the benzene, and the CH has a methyl group (CH2CH3) attached.

Looking at the NMR signals:

- The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be the CH with the methyl group (so the CH that's part of the sec-butyl group).
- The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be the adjacent CH2 groups.
- The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl group attached to the CH (so the CH(CH3) part of the substituent.
- The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) would be the terminal methyl group, which in the case of a sec-butyl group, perhaps it's part of the chain. Wait, no, the sec-butyl group would have a structure like CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. So the terminal would be CH2CH3. Wait, but in that case, the CH2CH3 would be at the end, so the NMR would show a triplet for the CH2 group, but in the data, the 0.9 ppm is a triplet (t, 3H), which would correspond to a CH2CH2CH3 group. Wait, no, a triplet in the NMR for 3H at 0.9 ppm suggests a terminal CH3 group, like the end of a chain, perhaps CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's a primary butyl group.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the substituent again.

If the substituent is a propyl group, like -CH2CH2CH2-, but that doesn't fit the NMR data. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group? No, that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is probably a methyl group at the end of an ethyl chain. So that would be like -CH2-CH2-CH3, making it a propyl group. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Let's think about the reaction. The question states that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Red phosphorus and HI are typically involved in the elimination of HX, often leading to the formation of alkenes. But wait, another possibility is that if the compound is a vicinal dihalide, then elimination would form an alkene. Alternatively, if there's a trihalide, perhaps it's a different reaction.

Wait, no, wait. Another reaction involving red phosphorus and HI is the hydrolysis of an acid chloride to a carboxylic acid. But that's usually with water; maybe not. Alternatively, if the compound is a nitrile, but I don't see any data that would indicate that.

Alternatively, another reaction that involves red phosphorus is the Wittig reaction, but that's usually with triphenylphosphine and aldehydes/ketones.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, eliminating HX to form an alkene. So if Compound X is a dihalide, for example, then upon treatment with red phosphorus and HI, it would eliminate to form an alkene.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me focus back on determining what Compound X is first.

Looking at the NMR again:

The 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet, likely a carboxylic acid proton. The aromatic region suggests a para-disubstituted benzene. The other signals suggest a substituent with a chain, perhaps a butyl group.

Wait, let's consider option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The structure would be a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

So the substituents are in para positions, which would give the aromatic protons as two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That matches the NMR.

The substituent, the sec-butyl group, would have the following structure attached to the benzene: CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait no, the sec-butyl group is attached via the second carbon, so the structure is actually CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. So the substituent is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. So the CH2 is attached to the benzene, and then the CH has a CH2CH3 group attached.

Looking at the NMR signals for the substituent:

- The CH group (from CH(CH2CH3)) would produce a multiplet around 2.9 ppm (1H).
- The CH2 groups adjacent to the benzene and the CH group would be around 1.7 ppm (2H).
- The methyl group attached to the CH would be a doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H), but wait, no, because the CH has a CH2CH3 group. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Wait, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, that's not correct. Let me clarify: the structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but that's not a correct IUPAC name. Wait, no, the correct structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-, but that can't be right because that would be a longer chain. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as a substituent where the branching is on the second carbon.

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw it: benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. So the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. So the benzene is attached to a CH2, which is attached to a CH that has a CH2CH3 group.

So, the CH2 group (attached to the benzene) would have protons that might show up around 2.9 ppm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the CH group (the one attached to the CH2CH3) would have a proton at around 2.9 ppm as a multiplet.

The CH2 group attached to the benzene would have protons that might appear as a multiplet around 1.7 ppm, but that's just a guess. Then, the CH2CH3 group attached to the CH would have the CH3 at around 1.4 ppm as a doublet (but wait, a CH2CH3 group would have a triplet, but maybe it's split into a doublet due to coupling with the adjacent CH group). Or perhaps it's a doublet of quartets or something more complex, but in the NMR data, it's a doublet. Alternatively, maybe the methyl group is attached to a CH that's splitting it into a doublet. Hmm, not entirely sure.

The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) would correspond to the terminal methyl group of the CH2CH2CH3 chain. Wait, no, in the case of a sec-butyl group, the terminal CH3 would be at the end of a two-carbon chain. Wait, no, the structure would be CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, so the CH2CH3 is a branch off the CH, making it a sec-butyl group.

Wait, perhaps the 0.9 ppm is from a CH2CH2CH3 group, which would be a longer chain, like a tertiary butyl group, but that doesn't fit with the substituent.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a pentyl group or something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the substituents are COOH and sec-butyl in para positions. The IR would have a carbonyl from the COOH at around 1700 cm-1, but in the data it's at 1720, which is a bit higher. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe the compound has an ester group. Let's think about that.

If the IR shows a carbonyl at 1720 cm-1, which is higher than a carboxylic acid, maybe it's an ester. So the IR would have that for an ester. So if the substituent is an ester group, like OAc (acetate), but that doesn't fit the NMR data.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a methyl benzoate or ethyl benzoate, but the NMR doesn't show the ester oxygen's splitting.

Wait, let's think about the NMR again. The 10.5 ppm peak is probably a COOH group. So maybe the compound is a benzoic acid derivative.

So, which option is a benzoic acid? Options A and C.

Option A is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. So the structure would be a benzene ring with an ethyl group in the para position and a propanoic acid group attached to another position. Wait, no. Wait, the name is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Wait, the substituent on the benzene is a propanoic acid group attached at the 4-ethyl position. No, perhaps the structure is benzene with an ethyl group in the para position, and the propanoic acid is attached to the benzene as well. So the benzene is substituted with both an ethyl group and a propanoic acid group in the para positions.

So, the structure would have two substituents: COOH at one position and ethyl at the para position. The NMR would then show two doublets for the aromatic protons, which is what we see. The 10.5 ppm peak would be the COOH proton.

The substituent (COOH) would be attached to the benzene as a propionic acid. So, benzene-CH2-COOH? Or benzene-COOH with a chain?

Wait, no. The name is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. So the phenyl group is attached to the second carbon of the propanoic acid. So the structure would be CH2-COOH attached to the benzene ring at the 4-ethyl position. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.

The IUPAC name for 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid would be: the propanoic acid is CH2-COOH, and the phenyl group is attached to the second carbon of the propanoic acid. So the structure is benzene ring with an ethyl group in the para position, and the propanoic acid is attached to the benzene via its second carbon. Wait, but that would make the substituent a -(CH2)COOH group. So the benzene has a -(CH2)COOH group and an ethyl group in para positions.

In that case, the aromatic protons would be two doublets, as observed. The protons on the benzene adjacent to the substituents would split accordingly.

The NMR signals would then include:

- The aromatic protons as two doublets.
- The CH2 group adjacent to the COOH would appear around 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) because it's a CH2 connected to a carbonyl.
- The COOH proton would be at 10.5 ppm.

The other signals: 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be another CH2 group, perhaps part of a longer chain, but I'm not sure. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) could be a methyl group attached to a CH, and 0.9 ppm (t,3H) would be a terminal methyl group.

Wait, but in the case of option A, the substituent is a propanoic acid attached as CH2-COOH. So the CH2 would be adjacent to the benzene. The CH2 would have two protons, but in the NMR, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for 1H. That might not fit, because the CH2 would have two protons as a quartet or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is benzene with a propyl group attached, where the middle CH is connected to the COOH. Wait, maybe the substituent is CH2-CH2-COOH, but then the NMR would have more signals.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let's try to look at the options again.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That would be a benzene ring with a sec-butyl group and a methyl group in the para position. The substituents would be in positions 1 and 4. But then the aromatic protons would be in two sets of doublets, which matches the NMR.

But then, where is the carbonyl in the IR? Because the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which would suggest a carbonyl. So option D doesn't have a carbonyl group, so maybe that's not the case.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. That would be a benzene ring with isobutyl and methyl groups in para. Again, no carbonyl, so the IR's 1720 peak wouldn't fit.

So, probably, the correct options are A or C, as they involve a carbonyl group.

Back to the reaction. The compound reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to amides or acids, but that's under specific conditions. Alternatively, in the presence of HX, perhaps a substitution or elimination occurs.

Wait, another possible reaction: if the compound is an alkyne, then reaction with HI and red phosphorus could lead to its hydration. But without more data, it's hard to tell.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the elimination of HBr from a dihalide to form an alkene. But that would require the presence of Br or Cl, which I'm not sure about from the NMR and IR data.

Alternatively, if the compound is a nitrile, then reaction with HI and red phosphorus could lead to the formation of an amine or an imine. But that's speculation.

Wait, another angle: the product is formed after the reaction. So perhaps the starting compound has a functional group that reacts with HI in the presence of red phosphorus.

Wait, another reaction I remember is the use of red phosphorus and HI to convert alkenes into alkanes via hydrohalogenation, but that's usually with alkenes and HX to add across the double bond.

Alternatively, I'm more confident that the starting compound is a benzoic acid derivative because of the NMR and IR data. So the product after reaction with red phosphorus and HI would perhaps lose a group.

Wait, if the starting compound is a benzoic acid (option C), then reacting with red phosphorus and HI might not change it much. Unless it's undergoing some kind of substitution. Alternatively, if the starting compound is a methyl ester, then reaction with HI and red phosphorus could saponify it to a carboxylic acid. But in the given options, option C is a benzoic acid, so that might be the case.

Wait, perhaps the starting compound is a benzoyl chloride. But then, the NMR would not show the same signals, as the chloride would be more deshielded. Also, the IR would show a higher wavenumber for the carbonyl, around 1800 cm-1, which isn't the case here.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, another approach: the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation. If Compound X is a benzene ring with a bromine and a substituent, then eliminating HBr would form a double bond. But without more data, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting compound is a benzyl halide, but again, without more info, it's tricky.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. If Compound X has a good leaving group, like a bromide, and upon treatment with HI, the bromide is replaced by iodide. But the question is about the final product, so perhaps it's a substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a cleavage of a nitrile. If the starting compound is a nitrile, then with HI and red phosphorus, it might form an imidamide or a different product. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility is that the starting compound is an alkyne. The IR peak at 3400–2500 could indicate an alkyne's C-H stretch. Then, with red phosphorus and HI, the alkyne could be hydrolyzed to a ketone or acid.

But I'm not certain about that. Let's go back to the structure.

Assuming that the starting compound is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI might not change it, unless it's undergoing some kind of substitution. Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester, and the reaction is saponification, converting the ester into a carboxylic acid. But in that case, the product would be the same as the starting material, which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a methyl ester, and after saponification, it becomes a carboxylic acid. So if the starting material is methyl 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate, then upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI (which is a strong acid), the ester would hydrolyze to the carboxylic acid.

Wait, but option C is the benzoic acid already. So perhaps the starting material is an ester, and upon reaction, it becomes the acid.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the reaction conditions again. Red phosphorus and HI are sometimes used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. For example, a nitrile group (RCN) can be hydrolyzed to RCOOH using red phosphorus and HI as a catalyst. So if the starting compound is a nitrile, the product would be a carboxylic acid.

Looking at the options, option C is a benzoic acid. So perhaps the starting compound is a benzene ring with a nitrile group and a sec-butyl substituent.

Wait, but the NMR data doesn't show any signals indicative of a nitrile. A nitrile would have a strong peak around 2200 cm-1 in IR, which isn't present here. So that's probably not the case.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let's analyze the integration of the NMR signals.

The 1H NMR: 10.5 (1H), 8.0 (2H), 7.2 (2H), 2.9 (1H), 1.7 (2H), 1.4 (3H), 0.9 (3H).

That's a total of 12 H. Let's check the molecular formula.

Assuming it's a benzoic acid derivative, the molecular formula could be C10H14O2 (for benzoic acid plus substituents).

Wait, for option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The formula would be C11H14O2.

The degrees of unsaturation for C11H14O2 would be (2*11 +2 -14 -0)/2 = (24-14)/2=5. So five degrees: one from the benzene ring, and the others from the substituent and the carboxylic acid.

The substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is C4H9.

So the molecular formula would be C7H5O2 (benzene) + C4H9 (sec-butyl) = C11H14O2.

The NMR data sums up the protons correctly.

So, if the starting compound is option C, then when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what would happen?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a reduction. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cleavage reaction.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a Birch reduction, but that typically uses ammonia and a metal.

Wait, another thought: Red phosphorus and HI can be used to reduce nitriles to amines, but that's not applicable here.

Alternatively, if the starting material is an ester, and it's hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid, but option C is already a carboxylic acid.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction is an elimination. If the starting material has a leaving group, like a bromide, adjacent to the substituent, then elimination would form a double bond.

But in option C, the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene, so perhaps it's a benzene ring with a bromine atom in a position that would allow elimination.

Wait, but that's speculative. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting compound is a benzyl bromide derivative, and the reaction forms an alkene.

But without more data, it's tricky.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't about substitution or elimination but about a rearrangement. For example, if the substituent is a tertiary butyl group, the reaction might lead to a different structure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a Grignard reaction, but that's not indicated here.

Wait, another angle: the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which could also correspond to an ester group. So maybe the starting compound is an ester, and upon reaction with HI and red phosphorus, it's hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid.

Looking back at the options, option C is a carboxylic acid. So perhaps the starting material is the corresponding ester, and the reaction converts it to the acid.

But the question states that Compound X is the starting material, and the options are the possible products. So the product would be option C only if the starting material was an ester.

Wait, but the question says Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI to form a product. So perhaps the starting material is an ester, and the product is the acid.

But the given options include a carboxylic acid (option C), so perhaps that's the product.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a nitrile, and the product is the acid, but that would require the IR to have a nitrile peak, which it doesn't.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to list what I know:

- IR: 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl (likely ester or acid).
- NMR: 10.5 ppm (COOH proton), aromatic ring, and a substituent with a chain.
- The substituent chain has a CH group (2.9 ppm), two CH2 groups (1.7 ppm), a methyl (1.4 ppm), and a terminal methyl (0.9 ppm).
- Reaction conditions: red phosphorus and HI. Possible reactions: elimination, substitution, hydrolysis.

From the reaction conditions, if the starting material is an ester, then reaction with HI and red phosphorus (which is a strong acid and a good nucleophile) might lead to saponification, converting the ester to a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, if it's a nitrile, it could be hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid.

But the IR doesn't show a peak for nitrile (around 2250 cm-1), so that's not likely.

If the starting material is an ester, and the product is a carboxylic acid, then option C would be the product.

But the question is about identifying the product, so if the starting material is the ester, the product would be the acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a bromide attached to the benzene, and the reaction forms a double bond.

Wait, but without more data, it's hard to say.

Another thought: the reaction could be a Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes using Zn(Hg)/HCl. But red phosphorus and HI are different.

Alternatively, I'm thinking about the possibility that Compound X is a methyl ester, and the reaction is hydrolysis to the acid.

In that case, the product would be option C.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a bromide, and the reaction eliminates HBr to form a double bond.

But again, without more data, it's hard to say.

Perhaps I should go back to the structure of Compound X. The NMR data suggests a para-disubstituted benzene with a substituent that has a chain leading to a terminal methyl. The substituent's NMR signals suggest a sec-butyl group.

So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene, and another substituent is a carboxylic acid group.

So the structure is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C).

Now, when this compound reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what happens?

I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps the reaction doesn't involve the benzoic acid group. Maybe the substituent's structure changes.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the benzoic acid group is converted into something else. For example, if the acid is converted into an iodide, but that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a decarboxylation, but that usually requires high temperatures.

Alternatively, the reaction could be a coupling reaction, but that's not indicated here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution on the substituent. For example, if the substituent has a good leaving group, like a bromide, then HI would substitute it with iodide.

But in the case of option C, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which doesn't have a leaving group. So that's unlikely.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Maybe the reaction doesn't involve the substituent and instead affects another part of the molecule.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a reduction. If the starting material has a carbonyl group, perhaps it's reduced to a CH2 group. But then the product would have a methylene group where the carbonyl was.

In that case, the benzoic acid would become a methoxy group or something else. But without more data, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction's purpose is to cleave a nitrile group, but again, the NMR doesn't support that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is removing a protecting group. For example, if the benzoic acid was protected as an ester, the reaction would remove the ester to form the acid.

But in that case, if the starting material was the ester, the product would be the acid, which is option C.

But the question is asking for the product of the reaction, so perhaps the starting material was an ester, and the product is the acid.

But without knowing the exact structure of the starting material, it's a bit hard to tell, but given the data, I think option C is the correct product.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the final product of Compound X, which reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The analysis begins with interpreting the IR and NMR data to deduce the structure of Compound X.

### IR Analysis:
- The peak at **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** suggests the presence of an alkyne or alkene, or possibly an O-H stretch (e.g., carboxylic acid).
- The peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** indicates a carbonyl group, likely from a carboxylic acid, ester, or ketone.
- Peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** are consistent with aromatic C=C stretching.

### NMR Analysis:
- **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: A broad singlet, characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).
- **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, indicative of a para-substituted benzene ring.
- **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: A multiplet likely corresponding to a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl.
- **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: A multiplet for CH₂ groups in a chain.
- **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: A doublet for a methyl group attached to a CH.
- **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet for a terminal methyl group in a chain.

### Structural Interpretation:
The NMR data suggests a para-disubstituted benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and a chain substituent. The chain substituent is identified as a **sec-butyl group** based on the NMR signals:
- The **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)** corresponds to the CH group in the sec-butyl group.
- The **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)** corresponds to the CH₂ groups in the chain.
- The **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)** corresponds to the methyl group attached to the CH.
- The **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)** corresponds to the terminal methyl group.

Thus, Compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
The reaction conditions involve red phosphorus and HI, which are typically used for hydrolysis or substitution reactions. However, since the product options do not suggest a significant structural change to the benzoic acid group, the reaction likely does not alter the carboxylic acid. Therefore, the product remains **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

### Critical Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid)**: This structure does not match the NMR data, as it would require a different substituent pattern on the benzene ring.
- **Option B (1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene)**: This structure lacks a carbonyl group, inconsistent with the IR data.
- **Option C (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid)**: Matches the IR and NMR data, with a para-substituted benzene, a carboxylic acid group, and a sec-butyl substituent.
- **Option D (1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene)**: Similar to Option B, this structure lacks a carbonyl group, inconsistent with the IR data.

### Conclusion:
The correct product, based on the IR, NMR data, and reaction conditions, is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.
