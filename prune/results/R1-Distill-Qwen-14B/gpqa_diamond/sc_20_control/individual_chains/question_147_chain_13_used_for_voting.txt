Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the answer. Let me read it carefully.

The problem says: Consider the annihilation process p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of A is given as mA c² = 300 MeV. The question is, what is the velocity of particle A? The options are A) 0.77c, B) 0.96c, C) 0.91c, D) 0.86c.

Hmm, alright, so let's think about this. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's try to break it down.

First, the process is proton and antiproton annihilating into two A+ and two A⁻ particles. Since protons and antiprotons are their own antiparticles, this makes sense. The result is four particles, two positive and two negative A particles.

Wait, but the problem mentions that the antiproton is moving slowly. Oh, right! So if the antiproton is moving slowly, then maybe its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. That probably means we can approximate its velocity as much lower than the speed of light. Hmm, but wait, if it's moving, but slowly, does that affect how we calculate the energy and momentum in the system?

Wait, the problem says the antiproton is 'slowly moving.' That probably implies that its velocity is much less than the speed of light. So maybe we can approximate its kinetic energy as (1/2)mv², but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps we should model it using relativistic equations, but with a small velocity, so maybe some approximations apply.

Wait, but wait a second. The initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. The proton is probably at rest, because the antiproton is moving. Or wait, the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly. So perhaps the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with some velocity. So the system's total energy is the sum of the proton's rest energy plus the antiproton's total energy (rest plus kinetic), and the total momentum is just the antiproton's momentum.

Wait, but wait. Proton and antiproton have the same mass. Let's call m_p the mass of a proton (and antiproton, since they're the same). So the rest energy of each is m_p c². Let me denote that as m_p c².

So, the initial system is a proton at rest and an antiproton moving. So the total energy of the system is E_initial = m_p c² + γ m_p c², where γ is the Lorentz factor for the antiproton. But since the antiproton is moving slowly, its velocity v is much less than c, so γ ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2c²) approximately.

But wait, the problem states that the antiproton is moving 'slowly,' which probably means that its kinetic energy is small compared to its rest energy. So perhaps, for simplicity, we can approximate the total energy as E_initial ≈ m_p c² + (gamma)m_p c². But since v is small, gamma is approximately 1 + v²/(2c²). So, E_initial ≈ m_p c² (1 + 1 + v²/(2c²)) )? Wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, the antiproton's energy is gamma m_p c², and the proton is at rest, so its energy is m_p c². So E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c² = m_p c² (1 + gamma). But since v is small, gamma is about 1 + (v²)/(2c²), so E_initial ≈ m_p c² [1 + (1 + (v²)/(2c²)))] = m_p c² (2 + v²/(2c²)). Hmm, but maybe this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is non-relativistic, so the kinetic energy is small, and we can model it using non-relativistic mechanics.

Wait, but the process is an annihilation, so we're producing particles A. The masses of A are given as mA c² = 300 MeV. I'm trying to find the velocity of particle A.

Wait, but wait, the process is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. So, four particles in total. Let's think about conservation of energy and momentum.

In the center-of-momentum frame, the initial momentum is zero because the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving. Wait, no. Because in the lab frame, the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving, so the initial momentum is p_initial = γ m_p v, where v is the velocity of the antiproton. But if v is small, then γ is approximately 1, so p_initial ≈ m_p v.

Now, after the annihilation, the total momentum must be the same as the initial. So the four particles (two A⁺ and two A⁻) must have a total momentum equal to m_p v.

But wait, the problem is to find the velocity of particle A. But in the products, the A particles are moving. Are they all moving in the same direction, or in different directions? If the initial momentum is along, say, the x-axis, then the total momentum of the four A particles must also be along the x-axis.

But considering that the products are two A⁺ and two A⁻, perhaps they are emitted symmetrically. For example, maybe two A particles are moving in the same direction as the initial antiproton, and two in the opposite. Hmm, but then their momenta would add up in a way that might not give the correct total.

Alternatively, perhaps the products are moving in such a way that the total momentum is the same as the initial. But maybe each A has the same velocity, but that seems unlikely because the charges are different, but perhaps the particles are moving in a symmetric fashion.

Alternatively, perhaps each A particle has the same speed, but opposite directions, so their momenta cancel out. But that can't be the case unless the total initial momentum is zero, which is only if the proton and antiproton are moving towards each other with equal and opposite momenta. But in this problem, the proton is at rest, so that's not the case.

Wait, no, the initial state is proton at rest, antiproton moving. So the initial momentum is non-zero. Therefore, the products must have a total momentum equal to that initial momentum.

But perhaps in this problem, the A particles are all moving in the same direction, which would maximize their momentum. But that might not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that all A particles have the same velocity, but that's not necessarily correct.

Wait, maybe I should consider this using conservation of energy and momentum. Let's think in terms of four-momentum. The initial four-momentum is the sum of the proton and antiproton four-momenta.

Wait, the proton is at rest, so its four-momentum is (E_p, 0), where E_p = m_p c².

The antiproton is moving with velocity v. Its four-momentum is (γ m_p c², γ m_p v c). Wait, no, I think four-momentum is (E/c, p), so E is in units of energy, and p is in units of momentum. So, the four-momentum of the antiproton is (γ m_p c, γ m_p v ) in units where c=1? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use relativistic energy and momentum expressions. Let me proceed step by step.

The initial four-momentum is the sum of the proton at rest and the moving antiproton.

Proton (at rest): energy E_p = m_p c², momentum p_p = 0.

Antiproton: energy E_ap = γ m_p c², momentum p_ap = γ m_p v, where γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So the total initial energy E_initial = E_p + E_ap = m_p c² (1 + γ).

The total initial momentum p_initial = p_ap = γ m_p v.

After annihilation, the four A particles must have a total energy E_final = 4 * (mA c²) * γ_A, where γ_A is the Lorentz factor for each A particle. Wait, but that's only if they're all moving at the same speed and direction, which probably isn't the case.

Alternatively, considering that the A particles are produced symmetrically, perhaps they all have the same speed, but in different directions. Let's assume that each A has the same speed v_A, but their momenta add up to the initial momentum.

Wait, but four particles each with speed v_A, their momenta would sum up. Let me think.

Suppose each A has velocity v_A. Let's say that two of them are moving in the same direction as the initial antiproton, and two in the opposite direction. Let's model this.

Wait, but the total momentum of the system must equal the initial momentum. So, if two are moving in the direction of the initial momentum and two opposite, the total momentum would be 2 p_A (for same direction) minus 2 p_A (for opposite), but that would sum to zero. That can't be right, because the initial momentum isn't zero.

Wait, that suggests that the assumption that two are moving in opposite directions isn't correct. Alternatively, perhaps all four A particles are moving in the same direction. Then their total momentum would be 4 p_A = p_initial. So p_A = p_initial /4.

But that would require all four A particles to have the same momentum. Alternatively, perhaps they are moving in such a way that their momenta add up to p_initial.

But maybe the problem is assuming that all A particles have the same speed, and their velocities are arranged symmetrically so that their momenta add up in a way that gives the total initial momentum. But without knowing the directions, this might get complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the approximation that the initial kinetic energy is small, so the products have a non-relativistic speed. So maybe we can use non-relativistic energy and momentum equations.

Wait, but the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly, so its velocity v is much less than c. So perhaps we can approximate γ as 1 + (v²)/(2c²), and expand in terms of v/c being small.

Let me think about the initial energy.

E_initial = m_p c² + γ m_p c² ≈ m_p c² (1 + (1 + v²/(2 c²))) ) ?

Wait, no, wait. The proton is at rest, so its energy is m_p c². The antiproton's energy is γ m_p c². So E_initial = m_p c² (1 + γ). But if v is small, γ ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2c²). So E_initial ≈ m_p c² (1 + 1 + v²/(2c²)) ) = m_p c² (2 + v²/(2c²)).

Similarly, the initial momentum is p_initial = γ m_p v ≈ m_p v (1 + (v²)/(2c²)). But since v is small, perhaps we can approximate this as m_p v.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write E_initial as approximately 2 m_p c² + (m_p v²)/(2c²) * c²? Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial energy is dominated by the rest mass, and the kinetic energy is a small addition. But perhaps for the purpose of this problem, the initial energy is approximately 2 m_p c² plus the kinetic energy of the antiproton.

Wait, but the problem gives m_A c² = 300 MeV. Let me recall that the proton mass is about 938 MeV/c². So m_p c² is approximately 938 MeV.

Wait, so the initial energy is E_initial ≈ m_p c² + (1 + (v²)/(2 c²)) m_p c² = m_p c² (2 + v²/(2 c²)).

But the products are four A particles each with rest mass energy m_A c² = 300 MeV. So the total rest mass energy of the products is 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV. The initial rest mass energy is 2 * 938 = 1876 MeV. So the initial rest mass is higher than the products' rest mass. So, perhaps the annihilation is possible because of the extra energy.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about conservation of energy and momentum.

In the initial state, the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with velocity v. So the total energy is E_initial = m_p c² + γ m_p c², and the total momentum is p_initial = γ m_p v.

In the final state, we have four A particles. Let me denote each as having energy E_A and momentum p_A. But their directions may vary. 

But maybe the problem is symmetric enough that each A has the same speed. Alternatively, perhaps the A particles are emitted symmetrically, so their momenta add up to p_initial. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the velocities of the A particles are the same, and their directions are arranged such that the total momentum is along the initial direction. For example, maybe two are moving in the same direction as the initial antiproton, and the other two in the opposite, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps all four A particles are moving in the same direction, so their momenta add up. Then, the total momentum would be 4 p_A, and the total energy would be 4 E_A. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed in such a way that all A particles have the same speed, and their momenta add up to the initial momentum. Let's proceed with that assumption.

So, if each A has momentum p_A, then 4 p_A = p_initial. So p_A = p_initial /4.

Similarly, the total energy would be 4 E_A = E_initial.

So, E_A = E_initial /4.

Now, E_A is the relativistic energy of each A particle, so E_A = γ_A m_A c².

And p_A is the relativistic momentum, which is γ_A m_A v_A, where v_A is the velocity of A.

So, putting this together:

p_initial = 4 * γ_A m_A v_A.

And E_initial = 4 * γ_A m_A c².

But E_initial is m_p c² + γ m_p c², where γ is for the antiproton.

So:

4 γ_A m_A c² = m_p c² (1 + γ).

And 4 γ_A m_A v_A = γ m_p v.

But this is getting complicated. Let me see if I can express γ_A in terms of E_initial and m_A.

Wait, E_initial = 4 γ_A m_A c².

So, γ_A = E_initial / (4 m_A c²).

Similarly, from the momentum equation:

p_initial = 4 γ_A m_A v_A.

But p_initial = gamma m_p v.

So, gamma m_p v = 4 gamma_A m_A v_A.

Hmm. So, substituting gamma_A from E_initial, which is gamma_A = E_initial/(4 m_A c²), and E_initial is m_p c² (1 + gamma).

So substituting, gamma_A = [m_p c² (1 + gamma)] / (4 m_A c²) ) = [ m_p (1 + gamma) ] / (4 m_A ) * c^0.

Because the c² cancels.

But m_p is about 938 MeV/c², m_A is 300 MeV/c².

So, m_p/m_A = 938 / 300 ≈ 3.1267.

So, gamma_A ≈ 3.1267 (1 + gamma) / 4 = (3.1267/4) (1 + gamma) ≈ 0.7817 (1 + gamma).

Now, from the momentum equation:

gamma m_p v = 4 gamma_A m_A v_A.

Substituting gamma_A = 0.7817 (1 + gamma):

gamma m_p v = 4 * 0.7817 (1 + gamma) * m_A v_A.

But m_p = m_A * (m_p / m_A ) ≈ m_A * 3.1267.

So, substituting m_p = 3.1267 m_A:

gamma * 3.1267 m_A v = 4 * 0.7817 (1 + gamma) m_A v_A.

The m_A terms cancel:

gamma * 3.1267 v = 4 * 0.7817 (1 + gamma) v_A.

So, 3.1267 gamma v = 3.1268 (1 + gamma) v_A.

Wait, 4 * 0.7817 is approximately 3.1268.

So, 3.1267 gamma v ≈ 3.1268 (1 + gamma) v_A.

Then, v_A ≈ (3.1267 gamma v) / (3.1268 (1 + gamma)).

Which simplifies to approximately (gamma v) / (1 + gamma) ) * (3.1267 / 3.1268) ≈ (gamma v) / (1 + gamma).

Since 3.1267 and 3.1268 are very close, the ratio is about 1.

So, v_A ≈ (gamma v) / (1 + gamma).

Hmm, that's an interesting relation.

But wait, let's think about gamma. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, v is much less than c, so gamma ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2 c²) ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2 c²).

So, gamma is approximately 1, because v is small. So, 1 + gamma ≈ 2.

Wait, but let's proceed with the approximation.

So, v_A ≈ (gamma v) / (1 + gamma) ) ≈ (gamma v) / (2) [since gamma ≈ 1].

Wait, but gamma is approximately 1, so gamma v ≈ v.

So, v_A ≈ v / 2.

Hmm, but that suggests that the velocity of A is about half the velocity of the antiproton, which is moving slowly. So if the antiproton's velocity is, say, 0.1c, then v_A would be about 0.05c. But the options given are all much higher, like 0.77c, etc. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption earlier. Maybe the initial frame isn't the lab frame. Perhaps I should consider the center-of-momentum frame.

Wait, but in the lab frame, the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving. So the initial momentum is non-zero.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that all the A particles have the same speed, and their velocities are arranged such that the total momentum equals the initial momentum.

Wait, but perhaps I should approach this from energy and momentum conservation in the center of mass frame, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the fact that the kinetic energy is small, so the problem can be treated as non-relativistic. So, let's try that approach.

In the non-relativistic case, the initial energy is the sum of the rest energies plus the kinetic energy of the antiproton.

E_initial = m_p c² + m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v².

So, E_initial = 2 m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v².

The products are four A particles. Assuming they are all at rest, their total energy would be 4 m_A c². But since they're moving, their kinetic energies contribute.

But in reality, the total energy must be conserved, and the total momentum must be conserved.

In the non-relativistic case, the initial momentum is p_initial = m_p v.

The final momentum is the sum of the momenta of the A particles. If all A particles have the same speed v_A, perhaps moving in the same direction, then the total momentum would be 4 m_A v_A.

Setting these equal: 4 m_A v_A = m_p v.

So, v_A = (m_p v) / (4 m_A).

Similarly, the energy conservation would give:

2 m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v² = 4 m_A c² + 4 * (1/2) m_A v_A².

Because each A has kinetic energy (1/2) m_A v_A².

Substituting v_A from above:

2 m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v² = 4 m_A c² + 4 * (1/2) m_A ( (m_p v)/(4 m_A) )^2.

Simplify the right-hand side:

4 * (1/2) m_A * (m_p² v² )/(16 m_A² )

= 2 m_A * (m_p² v²) / (16 m_A² )

= (2 m_p² v²) / (16 m_A )

= (m_p² v²) / (8 m_A )

So the equation becomes:

2 m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v² = 4 m_A c² + (m_p² v²)/(8 m_A )

Hmm, now I can plug in the known values.

m_p c² ≈ 938 MeV,
m_A c² = 300 MeV.

So, m_p = 938 MeV/c²,
m_A = 300 MeV/c².

Let me compute each term.

Let me write the equation again:

2*(938 MeV) + (1/2)*(938 MeV/c²)*v² = 4*300 MeV + ( (938 MeV/c²)^2 * v² )/(8 * 300 MeV/c² )

Simplify each term:

Left side: 1876 MeV + (469 MeV/c²) v².

Right side: 1200 MeV + [ (938^2 MeV²/c^4) * v² ] / (2400 MeV/c² )

Simplify denominator: 2400 MeV/c².

So, [938^2 / 2400 ] * v² MeV/c².

Wait, 938^2 is 938 * 938. Let me compute that: 900^2=810000, 38^2=1444, and cross terms 2*900*38=68,400. So, (938)^2 = (900+38)^2 = 900² + 2*900*38 + 38² = 810000 + 68400 + 1444 = 879,844.

So, [879844 MeV²/c^4 ] / (2400 MeV/c²) ) = (879844 / 2400 ) * (MeV²/c^4) * (c²/MeV) ) = (879844/2400 ) MeV c².

Wait, 879844 / 2400 is approximately 366.6. So, 366.6 MeV c².

So, the right side becomes 1200 MeV + 366.6 MeV c² * v².

Wait, but wait, the units are getting a bit messy. Let me think again.

Wait, the term [ (938 MeV/c²)^2 * v² ] / (8 * 300 MeV/c² )

Simplify numerator: (938)^2 MeV² / c^4 * v².

Denominator: 8*300 MeV/c² = 2400 MeV/c².

So, when you divide, you get (938^2 / 2400) * (MeV²/c^4) * (c^2/MeV) ) * v².

Which is (938^2 / 2400 ) * MeV c^(-2) * v².

Wait, perhaps I should compute the numerical factor:

938^2 = 879,844.

879,844 / 2400 ≈ 366.6017.

So, the term becomes ≈ 366.6017 MeV c^0 (since c^2 in numerator, denominator is c^2) multiplied by v².

Wait, but the units are getting a bit confusing. Let me try to re-express the equation with units in mind.

The equation is:

2m_p c² + (1/2)m_p v² = 4 m_A c² + (m_p² v²)/(8 m_A c^2) * c^4 ?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting tangled up here. Let me try to make sure all terms are in energy (MeV).

So, let's re-express the equation:

2 m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v² = 4 m_A c² + ( m_p² v² )/(8 m_A c²) * c^4 ? Because energy is in MeV, so terms must match.

Wait, no. Let me think. The term (1/2) m_p v² is in MeV, because m_p c² is 938 MeV, so m_p is 938 MeV/c². So, v is a fraction of c, say beta c, where beta = v/c.

So, v² = beta² c².

So, (1/2) m_p v² = (1/2) * (938 MeV/c²) * beta² c² = (1/2) * 938 * beta² MeV.

Similarly, the term (m_p^2 v^2 )/(8 m_A c^2 ) would have units:

m_p^2 is (MeV/c²)^2. v^2 is (beta^2 c^2). So, (MeV²/c^4) * (c^2) ) = MeV²/(c²).

Divided by (8 m_A c^2 ) ) which is (8 * 300 MeV/c^2 ) * c^2 = 2400 MeV.

So, (MeV²/(c^2)) / (2400 MeV) ) = MeV/(c^2 * 2400).

Hmm, that doesn't seem to fit. I must have made a mistake in the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this using beta as v/c, so v = beta c.

This might make the calculations easier.

Let me define beta = v/c. So, v = beta c.

Then, the momentum equation becomes:

m_p beta c = 4 m_A beta_A c,

where beta_A is v_A/c.

So, simplifying, m_p beta = 4 m_A beta_A.

So, beta_A = (m_p beta) / (4 m_A).

Similarly, the energy equation in non-relativistic terms is:

2 m_p c² + (1/2) m_p (beta c )^2 = 4 m_A c^2 + 4 * (1/2) m_A (beta_A c )^2.

Simplify:

2 m_p c^2 + (1/2) m_p beta^2 c^2 = 4 m_A c^2 + 2 m_A beta_A^2 c^2.

Divide both sides by c^2 to get:

2 m_p + (1/2) m_p beta^2 = 4 m_A + 2 m_A beta_A^2.

Now, substitute beta_A from the momentum equation:

beta_A = (m_p beta) / (4 m_A).

So, beta_A^2 = (m_p^2 beta^2) / (16 m_A^2).

Substituting into the energy equation:

2 m_p + (1/2) m_p beta^2 = 4 m_A + 2 m_A * (m_p^2 beta^2)/(16 m_A^2).

Simplify the right-hand side:

2 m_A * (m_p^2 beta^2 ) / (16 m_A^2 ) = (2 m_p^2 beta^2 ) / (16 m_A ) ) = (m_p^2 beta^2 )/(8 m_A).

So the equation becomes:

2 m_p + (1/2) m_p beta^2 = 4 m_A + (m_p^2 beta^2)/(8 m_A ).

Now, plug in the values:

m_p = 938 MeV,
m_A = 300 MeV.

So,

2 * 938 + (1/2) *938 * beta^2 = 4 * 300 + (938^2 beta^2)/(8 * 300).

Compute each term:

2 *938 = 1876 MeV.

(1/2)*938 = 469 MeV.

4 *300 = 1200 MeV.

938^2 = 879,844. So 879,844/(8 * 300) = 879,844 / 2400 ≈ 366.6017.

So the equation becomes:

1876 + 469 beta^2 = 1200 + 366.6017 beta^2.

Subtract 1200 from both sides:

676 + 469 beta^2 = 366.6017 beta^2.

Subtract 366.6017 beta^2 from both sides:

676 = (366.6017 beta^2 - 469 beta^2 )?

Wait, no:

Wait, 469 beta^2 - 366.6017 beta^2 = (469 - 366.6017) beta^2 ≈ 102.3983 beta^2.

So, 676 = 102.3983 beta^2.

So beta^2 = 676 / 102.3983 ≈ 6.602.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because beta is a velocity as a fraction of c, so beta^2 can't be greater than 1. Wait, this suggests a problem with the approach.

Hmm, perhaps the assumption that the A particles are moving non-relativistically is incorrect. Because if beta^2 is about 6.6, which would imply beta is about sqrt(6.6) ≈ 2.57, which is greater than 1, which is impossible. So this suggests that the non-relativistic approach is invalid here.

So, perhaps I need to use relativistic equations instead.

Let me try a different approach. Let me consider that the system's total energy and momentum are conserved. Let's denote the initial momentum as p_initial = gamma m_p v, where gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2).

The initial energy is E_initial = m_p c^2 + gamma m_p c^2.

After annihilation, we have four A particles. Let me assume that each A has the same velocity, which may not be the case, but perhaps it's a simplifying assumption.

So, for each A: energy is E_A = gamma_A m_A c^2,

momentum p_A = gamma_A m_A beta_A c,

where beta_A = v_A / c.

Since the initial momentum is p_initial, and assuming four A particles all moving in the same direction, their total momentum is 4 p_A = 4 gamma_A m_A beta_A c.

So,

4 gamma_A m_A beta_A c = gamma m_p v.

Similarly, the total energy is:

4 gamma_A m_A c^2 = m_p c^2 + gamma m_p c^2.

So,

4 gamma_A m_A = (1 + gamma) m_p.

Hmm, so from the energy equation,

gamma_A = [ (1 + gamma) m_p ] / (4 m_A ).

Let me compute gamma_A using this.

Now, from the momentum equation,

4 gamma_A m_A beta_A c = gamma m_p v.

Substituting gamma_A,

4 * [ (1 + gamma) m_p ]/(4 m_A ) * m_A beta_A c = gamma m_p v.

Simplify:

(1 + gamma) m_p beta_A c = gamma m_p v.

Cancel m_p from both sides,

(1 + gamma) beta_A c = gamma v.

So,

beta_A = (gamma v) / [ (1 + gamma) c ].

Hmm, but beta_A is v_A / c, so:

v_A = (gamma v c) / (1 + gamma).

Hmm, but I'm not sure if this is helping.

Alternatively, let's express beta_A in terms of gamma and v.

beta_A = (gamma v) / (1 + gamma) / c.

Wait, wait, no: beta_A is v_A / c. So,

v_A = (gamma v) / (1 + gamma).

Hmm.

But since gamma is approximately 1 for small velocities, because the antiproton is moving slowly, let's expand gamma in terms of v.

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2 c^2) for small v.

So,

gamma ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2 c²).

So,

gamma v ≈ v + (v^3)/(2 c²).

And,

1 + gamma ≈ 2 + (v^2)/(2 c^2).

So,

v_A ≈ [v + (v^3)/(2 c^2) ] / [ 2 + (v^2)/(2 c^2) ].

But since v is small, the higher-order terms can be neglected. So,

v_A ≈ v / 2.

But earlier, when I tried this approach, it didn't fit the options. So perhaps this approach isn't leading me anywhere.

Wait, perhaps I should instead consider that in the center of mass frame, the total momentum is zero, and after annihilation, the A particles must also have zero total momentum in that frame. But given that the initial frame is the lab frame, this might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of invariant quantities, like the Mandelstam variable s, which is the square of the total energy in the center of mass frame.

The Mandelstam variable s = (E_total)^2 - (p_total c)^2.

In the initial state, E_total is E_initial = m_p c^2 + gamma m_p c^2,

and p_total is p_initial = gamma m_p v.

So,

s = [m_p c^2 (1 + gamma)]^2 - [gamma m_p v c]^2.

But s is also equal to (2 m_p c^2)^2 + (2 m_p c^2 gamma - 2 m_p c^2 )^2 ? Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, the invariant s is the square of the total four-momentum, so s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2.

In this case, E1 is m_p c^2, p1 is zero,

E2 is gamma m_p c^2,

p2 is gamma m_p v.

So,

s = (m_p c^2 + gamma m_p c^2 )^2 - ( gamma m_p v c )^2.

Factor out m_p c^2,

s = [m_p c^2 (1 + gamma)]^2 - [gamma m_p v c]^2.

= m_p^2 c^4 (1 + gamma)^2 - gamma^2 m_p^2 v^2 c^2.

But since gamma^2 = 1/(1 - v²/c²), and v² = beta^2 c^2,

s = m_p^2 c^4 [ (1 + gamma)^2 - gamma^2 (beta^2) ].

But beta = v/c, so v^2 = beta^2 c^2.

So,

s = m_p^2 c^4 [ (1 + gamma)^2 - gamma^2 beta^2 ].

Hmm, perhaps I can simplify this expression.

Expanding (1 + gamma)^2 = 1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2.

So,

s = m_p^2 c^4 [ 1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2 - gamma^2 beta^2 ].

= m_p^2 c^4 [ 1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2 (1 - beta^2) ].

But since gamma^2 (1 - beta^2) = gamma^2 ( (1 - beta)(1 + beta) ) ), but I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, since gamma^2 (1 - beta^2) = (1/(1 - beta^2)) ) (1 - beta^2) ) = 1.

So,

gamma^2 (1 - beta^2) ) = 1.

So,

s = m_p^2 c^4 [ 1 + 2 gamma + 1 ].

= m_p^2 c^4 (2 + 2 gamma).

= 2 m_p^2 c^4 (1 + gamma).

Hmm, interesting. Now, the invariant s is the same in all frames, and in the center of mass frame, s is (sum of rest energies of products)^2.

Wait, no. In the center of mass frame, the total energy is the sum of the rest energies of the products, and the momentum is zero. So,

s = (sum E)^2 - (sum p c)^2.

But in the center of mass frame, sum p = 0, so s = (sum E)^2.

Sum E = 4 m_A c^2.

So,

s = (4 m_A c^2 )^2.

So,

(4 m_A c^2 )^2 = 2 m_p^2 c^4 (1 + gamma).

So,

16 m_A^2 c^4 = 2 m_p^2 c^4 (1 + gamma).

Divide both sides by 2 c^4:

8 m_A^2 = m_p^2 (1 + gamma).

So,

1 + gamma = 8 m_A² / m_p².

Compute 8 m_A² / m_p²:

m_A = 300 MeV/c²,

m_p = 938 MeV/c².

So,

8*(300)^2 / (938)^2 ≈ 8 * 90000 / (880,000 approx).

Wait, 300^2 =90000,

938^2 ≈ 879,844.

So,

8 * 90000 = 720,000.

720,000 / 879,844 ≈ 0.818.

So,

1 + gamma ≈ 0.818.

Wait, but 1 + gamma can't be less than 1, since gamma ≥1. So this can't be right. There must be a mistake here.

Ah, wait, let me check the calculation again.

Wait, 300^2 is 90,000.

So,

8 * 90,000 = 720,000.

m_p^2 is (938)^2 = 879,844.

So,

720,000 / 879,844 ≈ 0.818.

So,

1 + gamma = 0.818.

Which would imply gamma is negative, which is impossible.

So this suggests a contradiction, which means I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of s.

Wait, earlier, I had:

s = (E_initial)^2 - (p_initial c)^2.

E_initial = m_p c^2 + gamma m_p c^2 = m_p c^2 (1 + gamma).

p_initial = gamma m_p v.

So,

s = [m_p c^2 (1 + gamma)]^2 - [gamma m_p v c]^2.

= m_p^2 c^4 (1 + gamma)^2 - gamma^2 m_p^2 v^2 c^2.

Factoring m_p^2 c^4,

= m_p^2 c^4 [ (1 + gamma)^2 - gamma^2 (v^2/c^2) ].

But since v^2/c^2 = beta^2,

s = m_p^2 c^4 [ (1 + gamma)^2 - gamma^2 beta^2 ].

But (1 + gamma)^2 = 1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2,

and gamma^2 beta^2 = gamma^2 (v^2/c^2 ) = [gamma^2 (v^2/c^2 ) ].

But from the definition of gamma,

gamma^2 (1 - beta^2 ) =1,

so gamma^2 beta^2 = gamma^2 (1 - 1/gamma^2 ) )= gamma^2 -1.

Wait, because gamma^2 (1 - beta^2 ) )=1 → gamma^2 beta^2 = gamma^2 -1.

Wait, let me see.

gamma^2 = 1/(1 - beta^2).

So,

gamma^2 (1 - beta^2 ) )=1,

gamma^2 beta^2 = gamma^2 (1 - (1 - beta^2 )) )= gamma^2 (beta^2) = (gamma beta )^2.

But perhaps I should proceed differently.

Alternatively, let me substitute gamma^2 beta^2 = (gamma beta )^2 = (v/(c sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)})) )^2.

= v^2/(c^2 (1 - v^2/c^2 )).

= (v^2/c^2 ) / (1 - v^2/c^2 ).

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to compute the expression inside the square brackets.

(1 + gamma)^2 - gamma^2 beta^2 = 1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2 - gamma^2 beta^2.

Hmm, perhaps I can factor this as:

= 1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2 (1 - beta^2 ).

But since gamma^2 (1 - beta^2 ) =1,

= 1 + 2 gamma + 1.

= 2 (1 + gamma).

So,

s = m_p^2 c^4 * 2 (1 + gamma).

So,

s = 2 m_p^2 c^4 (1 + gamma).

But earlier, I set s = (4 m_A c^2 )^2.

So,

(4 m_A c^2 )^2 = 2 m_p^2 c^4 (1 + gamma).

Which gives,

16 m_A^2 c^4 = 2 m_p^2 c^4 (1 + gamma).

Divide both sides by 2 c^4,

8 m_A^2 = m_p^2 (1 + gamma).

So,

1 + gamma = 8 m_A^2 / m_p^2.

Plugging in the values:

m_A =300,

m_p=938.

8*(300)^2 =8*90,000=720,000.

m_p^2 =938^2≈879,844.

So,

1 + gamma =720,000 / 879,844 ≈0.818.

But 1 + gamma can't be less than 1, since gamma is ≥1.

So this implies that 0.818 ≈ 1+gamma → gamma≈-0.182, which is impossible.

So, this suggests that my assumption that s=(4 m_A c^2)^2 is incorrect.

Wait, no. Because in the center of mass frame, the sum of the rest energies is 4 m_A c^2, and the total energy would be that plus kinetic energies. So, s is not equal to (4 m_A c^2 )^2, but is larger than that.

Ah, right! I made a mistake here. Because in the center of mass frame, the total energy is the sum of the rest energies plus the kinetic energies of the products, so s is larger than (4 m_A c^2 )^2.

So, the correct equation is:

s = (sum E)^2 - (sum p c)^2.

But in the center of mass frame, sum p=0, so sum E is the total energy in that frame, which is larger than 4 m_A c^2. So, s = (sum E )^2 = (E_total )^2.

So, E_total = sum E = 4 m_A c^2 + KE.

But perhaps this approach isn't helping, so maybe I should think differently.

Alternative approach:

Since the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps we can approximate gamma as 1, and proceed.

So, gamma ≈1.

Then, the initial energy is E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c^2.

The initial momentum is p_initial ≈ m_p v.

After annihilation, the four A particles have rest mass energy 4 m_A c^2. But 4 m_A c^2 = 4*300=1200 MeV, which is less than 2 m_p c^2 ≈ 1876 MeV. So, the system has enough rest mass to allow the annihilation.

But then, the kinetic energy of the products must account for the difference.

Wait, but perhaps using the conservation of energy and momentum with gamma=1.

So, E_initial = 2 m_p c^2.

p_initial = m_p v.

In the final state,

E_final = 4 gamma_A m_A c^2,

p_final =4 gamma_A m_A v_A.

Conservation gives:

E_initial = E_final → 2 m_p c^2 =4 gamma_A m_A c^2.

So,

gamma_A = (2 m_p )/(4 m_A ) = m_p/(2 m_A )=938/(2*300)=938/600≈1.563.

So, gamma_A ≈1.563.

The velocity beta_A is given by gamma_A = 1/sqrt(1 - beta_A^2 ).

So,

1.563 =1/sqrt(1 - beta_A^2 ).

Square both sides:

(1.563)^2 ≈2.443 ≈1/(1 - beta_A^2 ).

So,

1 - beta_A^2 =1/2.443 ≈0.409.

So,

beta_A^2 ≈1 -0.409 =0.591,

beta_A≈sqrt(0.591)≈0.769c.

Which is approximately 0.77c, which is option A.

But wait, the options include 0.77c as option A.

But wait, the earlier assumption that gamma=1 may not be accurate, since the antiproton's velocity is not that small. Because if gamma is 1, then v=0, which isn't the case. But since the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps this approximation holds.

So, with gamma≈1, we get beta_A≈0.77c, which matches option A.

But wait, looking back, the initial assumption that gamma≈1 leads to E_initial=2m_p c^2, but in reality, E_initial is 2 m_p c^2 + (gamma-1) m_p c^2. So, with gamma≈1, the additional energy is small, but perhaps this leads to a small correction in the velocity.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 0.77c, which is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the annihilation process **$p + \bar{p} \to 2A^+ + 2A^-$** using conservation of energy and momentum. The antiproton is moving slowly, implying its velocity $v$ is much smaller than the speed of light $c$, and its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest energy. This allows us to approximate the Lorentz factor $\gamma \approx 1$ for the antiproton.

### Key Equations and Assumptions:
1. **Initial Energy**:  
   The total initial energy is the sum of the proton's rest energy and the antiproton's total energy:  
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = m_p c^2 + \gamma m_p c^2 \approx 2 m_p c^2 \quad (\text{since } \gamma \approx 1).
   \]

2. **Initial Momentum**:  
   The proton is at rest, so its momentum is zero. The antiproton's momentum is:  
   \[
   p_{\text{initial}} = \gamma m_p v \approx m_p v \quad (\text{since } \gamma \approx 1).
   \]

3. **Final Energy and Momentum**:  
   After annihilation, the system produces four $A$ particles. Assuming all $A$ particles have the same velocity $v_A$, their total energy and momentum are:  
   \[
   E_{\text{final}} = 4 \gamma_A m_A c^2, \quad p_{\text{final}} = 4 \gamma_A m_A v_A,
   \]  
   where $\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_A^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor for the $A$ particles.

4. **Conservation of Energy**:  
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = E_{\text{final}} \implies 2 m_p c^2 = 4 \gamma_A m_A c^2.
   \]  
   Solving for $\gamma_A$:  
   \[
   \gamma_A = \frac{2 m_p}{4 m_A} = \frac{m_p}{2 m_A}.
   \]

5. **Conservation of Momentum**:  
   \[
   p_{\text{initial}} = p_{\text{final}} \implies m_p v = 4 \gamma_A m_A v_A.
   \]  
   Substituting $\gamma_A$ from above:  
   \[
   m_p v = 4 \left(\frac{m_p}{2 m_A}\right) m_A v_A \implies v_A = \frac{v}{4}.
   \]

### Calculation of $\gamma_A$:
Using $m_p c^2 = 938 \, \text{MeV}$ and $m_A c^2 = 300 \, \text{MeV}$:  
\[
\gamma_A = \frac{m_p}{2 m_A} = \frac{938}{2 \times 300} \approx 1.563.
\]

### Solving for $v_A$:
The Lorentz factor $\gamma_A$ is related to the velocity $v_A$ by:  
\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_A^2/c^2}}.
\]  
Rearranging for $v_A$:  
\[
v_A = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_A^2}}.
\]  
Substituting $\gamma_A \approx 1.563$:  
\[
v_A = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(1.563)^2}} \approx c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{2.443}} \approx c \sqrt{0.591} \approx 0.77c.
\]

### Final Answer:
The velocity of particle $A$ is approximately **$0.77c$**, which corresponds to **Option A**.
