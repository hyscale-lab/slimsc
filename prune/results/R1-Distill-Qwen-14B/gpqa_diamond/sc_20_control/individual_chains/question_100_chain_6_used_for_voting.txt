Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and think through each reaction.

The question starts with Compound A, which has the formula C3H6. Hmm, C3H6 is either propene or cyclopropane. Wait, no, cyclopropane would have a different structure. Oh wait, propene is C3H6 as well, right? Because propene is CH2=CHCH3, so it's an alkene.

So Compound A is C3H6, probably propene. Then it undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride. Oh, bromination with CCl4 is likely an addition reaction because propene is an alkene. So the bromine would add across the double bond, giving 1,2-dibromopropane. Wait, no, the addition of Br2 to propene would give 1,2-dibromopropane, but wait, propene is CH2=CH2CH3? Or CH2=CHCH3. Oh, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So when Br2 adds, it adds across the double bond, so the product would be BrCH2-CHBr-CH3. So that's compound B.

Then, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base, which usually leads to elimination reactions. So if B is 1,2-dibromopropane, when treated with alcoholic KOH, it would undergo dehydrohalogenation (elimination) to form an alkene. But wait, which one? Let's think. The structure is BrCH2-CHBr-CH3. When KOH is present, it would abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. The possible alkenes formed would depend on which H is removed. For 1,2-dibromopropane, the possible eliminations could form either 1-propene or 2-propene? Wait, no, wait. Let me imagine the structure. The molecule is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. When eliminating, the adjacent Br and H are removed. So upon elimination, the double bond forms between carbons 1 and 2 or 2 and 3?

Wait no, the dihalide is 1,2-dibromopropane, so the two Br are on C1 and C2. So when you eliminate, you can lose H from C2 and Br from C1, or H from C1 and Br from C2? Wait, but wait, no. The structure is CH2Br-CH2Br-CH3? No, if it's 1,2-dibromopropane, it's CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So the central carbon (C2) has a Br, and C1 also has a Br attached.

Wait, when you eliminate, you take a β hydrogen. So a hydrogen from a carbon adjacent to the Br. So for the Br on C1, the adjacent β hydrogens are on C2. Wait, maybe the structure is more like CH2Br-CH2Br-CH3? No, that would be 1,2,3-tribromopropane if both CH2 groups have Br. Wait, no, the original compound A is propene (CH2=CHCH3), and adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2Br-CHBr-CH3).

So when you treat this with alcoholic KOH, elimination occurs. Which positions? Let's see. The possible eliminations would form either propene or another di-substituted alkene. Wait, but 1,2-dibromopropane is vicinal dihalide. Eliminating H and Br from adjacent carbons would form a double bond between C1 and C2 or C2 and C3. Wait, but wait, in the molecule CH2Br-CHBr-CH3, each Br is on adjacent carbons. So when you eliminate, you can take a Br from C1 and a H from C2, leading to a double bond between C1 and C2. That would give CH2=CH-CH2Br? No, wait, no. Wait, elimination would form a double bond. Let me think again. If you have CH2Br-CHBr-CH3, and you eliminate Br and H from adjacent carbons, you form a double bond.

Wait, maybe it's better to draw this. The molecule is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. If KOH abstracts a H from C2, then the Br on C1 leaves, forming a double bond between C1 and C2. So the product would be CH2=CH-CH2Br? Or CH2=CH-CH3? Wait, no, because the Br is on C1 and C2. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, no, elimination would involve the loss of two substituents (Br and H) from adjacent carbons, leading to a double bond. So in CH2Br-CHBr-CH3, the possible elimination is between C1 and C2 or C2 and C3. Wait, if we lose H from C2 and Br from C1, that would form a double bond between C1 and C2. So that would give CH2=CH-CH2Br? No, wait, because the Br on C2 remains. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the elimination of H and Br from C2 and C3. So if H is removed from C3, Br from C2, then the double bond forms between C2 and C3. So the product would be CH2Br-CH2-CH2, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I should think of the structure as (CH2Br)CHBrCH3. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination can lead to 1-propene or 2-propene, but wait, 2-propene is actually propene again because propene is CH2=CHCH3. Wait, maybe the product is propene, but that can't be right because elimination of 1,2-dibromopropane would give 1,2-dipropene? No, no. Wait, maybe the product is 1-propene, which is propene.

Wait, perhaps in this case, the elimination of 1,2-dibromopropane would give propene. Because when you eliminate two Br's from adjacent positions, you form a double bond between those carbons.

Wait, an alternative approach: the addition of Br2 to propene forms 1,2-dibromopropane, and then elimination with KOH would form propene again. But that's possible only if the position is right.

Wait, but wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would form CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. Now, when treated with alcoholic KOH, which is a base, it would cause elimination. So the H would be removed from the adjacent carbon to Br. Let's say the H is on the same carbon as Br or adjacent. Wait, in this case, each Br is on a different carbon, and adjacent to each other.

So, for each Br on C1 and C2, the adjacent H would be on C2 and C1, respectively. So elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2, but that would require losing H from C2 and Br from C1, forming CH2=CHBr-CH3? That doesn't seem right.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the mechanism. The reaction is elimination, so it's an E2 mechanism. The base (KOH) abstracts a β hydrogen, and the leaving group (Br-) leaves, forming a double bond.

In CH2Br-CHBr-CH3, each Br is on C1 and C2. So for the Br on C1, the β hydrogens are on C2. So when KOH abstracts a β H from C2, the Br on C1 leaves, forming a double bond between C1 and C2. So the product is CH2=CHBr-CH3? No, wait, because the Br on C2 is still present. Hmm, that can't be right.

Wait a minute, maybe the structure is different. Oh! Wait, maybe when Br2 adds to propene, it adds across the double bond, giving 1,2-dibromopropane as CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. Then, when treated with KOH (alcoholic), the base abstracts a hydrogen, and the adjacent Br leaves. So, say, the H is abstracted from C2, the Br from C1 leaves, and the double bond forms between C1 and C2. So the product would be CH2=CH-CH2Br? Wait, but then there's still a Br on C3. No, wait, no. Because in the original compound, the Br's are on C1 and C2. So if the Br on C1 leaves, and a H on C2 leaves, the double bond would form between C1 and C2, so the structure becomes CH2=CH-CH2Br? No, wait, no. Because the Br on C2 is still there.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Maybe the addition of Br2 to propene gives 1,2-dibromopropane, which is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. Then elimination in alcoholic KOH would form 1-propene (which is the same as propene), but that doesn't make sense because that's the starting material. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a different position.

Wait, maybe when you eliminate, you can form 2-propene, but propene is already 1-propene. So perhaps the product is 1,2-dibromopropane → propene, but that's the same as the starting material. That seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a different diene, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe the elimination doesn't occur between C1 and C2 but between C2 and C3. But in the structure CH2Br-CHBr-CH3, C2 has a Br and is adjacent to C3 (which has CH3). So, if the H is abstracted from C3, the Br on C2 leaves, forming a double bond between C2 and C3. Then, the product would be CH2Br-CH2-CH2? No, wait, that can't be right. Alternatively, the product would be CH2Br-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C2 and C3, which would make it CH2Br-C=CH2. Wait, but that's 2-bromopropane-1, but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about what reaction forms what. So, propene (compound A) → bromination in CCl4 gives 1,2-dibromopropane (compound B). Then, B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Wait, alcoholic KOH is a base, so elimination. The product (compound C) would be an alkene. Since the starting material is 1,2-dibromopropane, the elimination would lead to 1-propene or 2-propene. But wait, 1-propene is the same as propene, which is the starting material. So maybe the product is 1,2-dibromopropane → when eliminated, forms 2-propene? No, wait, 2-propene is the same as propene since propene is CH2=CHCH3. So perhaps the product is propene again. But that doesn't make sense, does it?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the structure. Let's try again. Compound A is propene: CH2=CHCH3. Add Br2 in CCl4 → 1,2-dibromopropane: CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. Then, treatment with alcoholic KOH (which is a strong base) would cause dehydrohalogenation, eliminating HBr and forming a double bond. But since the two Brs are adjacent, eliminating would form a double bond between them, giving CH2=CHCH3 again, which is propene. But that's the same as compound A. So compound C would be propene. Hmm, but then the next step says compound C is passed through a red-hot iron tube to produce compound D.

Wait, passing an alkene through a red-hot iron tube is a condition for hydrogenation? Or maybe for something else. Wait, red-hot iron is usually used for catalytic hydrogenation. Wait, but in the presence of H2? Or perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation? No, I think the red-hot iron in the presence of H2 is used for hydrogenation, adding H2 across the double bond. But if compound C is propene, then passing it over red-hot iron (like a catalyst) with H2 would hydrogenate it to propane. But the question doesn't mention adding H2. Wait, maybe it's a different reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the red-hot iron is used for dehydrogenation, but that's for forming alkenes, not alkanes.

Wait, maybe the reaction is something else. Oh, wait, another possibility is that when an alkene is passed through a red-hot iron tube without hydrogen, it might cause a reaction, like cracking or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation, but that doesn't fit here.

Wait, wait. Maybe compound C is not propene. Let me think again. Maybe the elimination from 1,2-dibromopropane gives a different product. Oh! Wait, perhaps I was wrong about the structure of compound B. Because when Br2 is added to propene, it could form 1,2-dibromopropane, but maybe in a different configuration. Or perhaps it's not an addition but a substitution. Wait, no, in the presence of CCl4, it's likely a diaddition across the double bond, giving 1,2-dibromopropane.

Wait, perhaps the elimination product isn't propene but another di-substituted alkene. Wait, perhaps it's 2-bromopropene or something else. No, perhaps the product is 2-bromopropene? Let me think. Elimination from 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2Br-CHBr-CH3) would form either 1-propene or 2-propene, but I'm not getting it right. Alternatively, perhaps the product is 1-bromo-1-propene.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me think step by step again.

1. Compound A: C3H6. Structure is propene (CH2=CHCH3).
2. Bromination (Br2 in CCl4): adds across double bond → 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2Br-CHBr-CH3).
3. Reaction with alcoholic KOH: elimination, so we lose HBr. The product is an alkene. Since the dihalide is 1,2-dibromopropane, elimination would likely form 1-propene (CH2=CHCH3) again. So compound C is propene.

Then, compound C (propene) is passed through a red-hot iron tube. Hmm. Red-hot iron is a catalyst for hydrogenation. So if H2 is present, propene would hydrogenate to propane. But the problem doesn't mention H2. So maybe the reaction is something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrogenation reaction, but I don't think so. Alternatively, perhaps the red-hot iron is used for another purpose, like cracking, but that's more for breaking down larger hydrocarbons.

Wait, maybe the reaction is dehydrogenation, which would form something else. For example, propene to form something else? Wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. Passing it over a red-hot iron might be a catalyst for some reaction. Wait, another possibility: the iron might cause the alkene to undergo a polymerization reaction, but that's more for making plastics, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about other possibilities. If compound C is propene (CH2=CHCH3), and it's passed through a red-hot iron tube, maybe it's hydrogenated to propane (CH3CH2CH3), which would be compound D. Then, compound D is propane.

Next, compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form compound E. Hmm, reacting propane with two strong acids? That doesn't seem right. Propane is an alkane, so it typically doesn't react with acids. Unless under certain conditions. Wait, perhaps the mixture of acids is H2SO4 and H2O, which would lead to sulfonation, but that's for aromatic compounds. Propane doesn't have aromatic rings, so that's unlikely.

Wait, maybe the two strong acids are H2SO4 and HNO3 or something else. Another thought: maybe D is propane, and the two strong acids are H2SO4 and H2O, perhaps leading to some sulfonation, but I don't think it applies here. Alternatively, maybe D is something else, and I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let me go back. Perhaps compound C is something else. Did I make a mistake in the elimination step? Let me think again. So, compound B is 1,2-dibromopropane. When treated with alcoholic KOH, elimination occurs. The possible products are 1-propene (propene) or 2-propene (but that's the same as propene). Alternatively, perhaps the product is 2-bromopropene? No, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination doesn't occur between the two Brs but elsewhere. Wait, maybe the structure of compound B is different. Let me think again. If propene is CH2=CHCH3, and Br2 adds across the double bond, the product is CH2BrCHBrCH3. Then, when KOH is added, elimination occurs. Which positions?

Wait, maybe the elimination occurs between C2 and C3. So, taking a hydrogen from C3, and Br from C2. That would form a double bond between C2 and C3, giving CH2Br-C=CH2. So the product would be 2-bromo-1-propene. Wait, but that's not possible because the starting material was 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2Br-CHBr-CH3). So eliminating H from C3 and Br from C2 would form CH2Br-C=CH2. But that would leave a Br on C1, so the structure would be CH2Br-CBr=CH2? No, wait, no, because the Br is eliminated.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of it as a mechanism. In E2 elimination, the base abstracts a β hydrogen, and the leaving group (Br-) departs, forming a double bond. So, in CH2Br-CHBr-CH3, each Br is on C1 and C2. So for each Br, the β hydrogens are on adjacent carbons.

So, for the Br on C1, β hydrogens are on C2. So, if the base abstracts a H from C2, Br on C1 leaves, forming a double bond between C1 and C2. So the product would be CH2=CH-CH2Br? But wait, that leaves a Br on C3. Wait, no, the original structure is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So if Br on C1 and H on C2 are eliminated, the product would be CH2=CH-CH3, but that would require the Br on C2 to stay. Wait, no, because elimination involves losing H and Br from adjacent carbons. So, the product would have a double bond between C1 and C2, and lose HBr. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2Br? No, because that would require the Br on C3.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of the structure as:

Original B: CH2Br-CHBr-CH3.

Elimination occurs between C1 and C2, losing H from C2 and Br from C1. So the structure becomes CH2=CBr-CH3. Wait, no, that's not right because that would leave a Br on C2. Wait, maybe the product is CH2=CH-CH2Br. No, that's not possible because the Br would be on C3, which wasn't present in B.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of 1,2-dibromopropane → 1,2-dipropene? No, that doesn't make sense.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe it's better to think that the elimination leads to 1-propene (i.e., the same as compound A). So compound C is propene (CH2=CHCH3). Then, passing it through a red-hot iron tube would hydrogenate it to propane (CH3CH2CH3), which is compound D.

Then, compound D (propane) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form compound E. Wait, but how? Propane is an alkane, and typically doesn't react with strong acids. Unless under some specific conditions. Alternatively, perhaps the two strong acids are H2SO4 and HNO3, which could cause some sulfonation or nitration, but that typically requires aromatic rings or double bonds, which propane lacks. So perhaps I'm wrong about compound C.

Alternatively, maybe the elimination doesn't give propene but another compound. Let me think again: perhaps the product of elimination from 1,2-dibromopropane is 2-bromopropene. Wait, that might make sense. So, structure would be CH2Br-C=CH2. Then, when you pass this through a red-hot iron tube, what happens? Maybe it's hydrogenated to CH2Br-CH2-CH3, which is 1-bromopropane.

But then, compound D would be 1-bromopropane. Then, reacting with a mixture of two strong acids. Hmm, 1-bromopropane with strong acids... Maybe it undergoes hydrolysis. If the strong acids are H2SO4 and H2O, it could undergo hydrolysis to form propane-1-ol. But then, reaction with two strong acids, perhaps H2SO4 and HNO3... Not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm on the wrong track. Let me try a different approach. Let me go through each step, assuming that the reaction produces certain compounds, and then see which options are incorrect.

So, starting over:

1. A is C3H6. It's propene → CH2=CHCH3.
2. Bromination in CCl4 → 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2Br-CHBr-CH3) → B.
3. B reacts with alcoholic KOH → elimination → forms an alkene. So, the product C is (probably) propene again (CH2=CHCH3), but that seems like a loop. Hmm, but if that's the case, then:
4. Passing C through red-hot iron → hydrogenation to propane (D: CH3CH2CH3).
5. D (propane) reacts with two strong acids → E. But I don't see a reaction here, so perhaps I'm wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps step 3 gives a different product. Maybe elimination from 1,2-dibromopropane gives 1-bromopropene (CH2Br-CH2-CH2?), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is 1,2-dibromopropane → elimination gives 1-bromo-1-propene (CH2=CBrCH3). Then, when passed over red-hot iron, perhaps hydrogenation occurs, adding H2 to form CH2Br-CH2-CH3 (1-bromopropane) → D.

Then, D reacts with two strong acids. If the acids are H2SO4 and H2O, it would hydrolyze to form propanol. But that's a substitution reaction, but with strong acid and water. Wait, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution. 1-bromopropane in presence of strong acid and water would undergo SN1 or SN2 hydrolysis to form propane-1-ol (CH3CH2CH2OH). So E would be propanol.

Then, E (propanol) reacts with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid to form F. Iron and HCl usually cause a reaction, perhaps acid-catalyzed dehydration. Propanol (E) with H2SO4 (as acid) and heat would dehydrate to form propene (CH2=CHCH3) → which is compound F.

Then, F (propene) reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2) to form G. Nitrous acid is typically used for diazotization, but that's for aromatic amines. Wait, but propene is an alkene. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is hydroxyamination or something else. Wait, another possibility: nitrous acid can react with alkenes in the presence of a catalyst to form a diol, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction. Wait, another thought: perhaps F is propene, which reacts with nitrous acid under certain conditions to form something else, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe F is propane, but that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again:

If E is propanol, and F is formed by reacting E with iron scrap and HCl. Iron and HCl typically produce FeCl2 and H2 gas. But in the presence of an alcohol, perhaps it's a substitution reaction. Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but that would require a halogen. Alternatively, perhaps it's a catalytic dehydrogenation, converting the alcohol to an alkene. Propanol (E) → with Fe and HCl, perhaps it's heated to form propene (F: CH2=CHCH3). Then, F (propene) reacts with nitrous acid. Hmm, but propene doesn't react with HNO2 under normal conditions. Maybe it's a different compound.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about E. Let me think again. If D is 1-bromopropane, and E is propanol, then F would be propene via dehydration. Then, G would be the product of propene reacting with nitrous acid. But I'm not sure what that would be. Alternatively, perhaps F is propane, but then reacting with nitrous acid... Not likely.

Alternatively, maybe the sequence is different. Let me think about the options given and see which ones might be incorrect.

The options are:

A) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.
B) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.
C) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.
D) C is a flammable gas.

Let me analyze each option.

Option D: C is a flammable gas. If C is propene (CH2=CHCH3), which is a gas and highly flammable, then D is correct. So option D's statement is correct, so it can't be the incorrect statement.

Option C: D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR. If D is propane (CH3CH2CH3), its NMR would show a triplet for the CH2 and a triplet for the CH3, but wait, no. Wait, propane's structure is CH3-CH2-CH3. The NMR would show a singlet for the CH3 groups on both ends because of symmetry. The middle CH2 would be between two equivalent CH3 groups, so it would be a quartet. Wait, no, wait. When you have CH3-CH2-CH3, the CH2 group is adjacent to two CH3 groups. So the CH2 would split into a quartet, but due to symmetry, the CH2 might appear as a singlet. Wait, no. Wait, in NMR, the middle CH2 in propane would have neighboring CH3 groups, so each CH2 proton would see two adjacent CH3 groups. The splitting would be into a quartet, but due to the two adjacent CH3 groups being equivalent, the quartet would split into a triplet. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, in propane, each CH3 group is attached to a CH2. The CH2 has two protons, each seeing the two CH3 groups. Wait, but in reality, the CH2 in propane is a single group, and the NMR would show a singlet for the CH3 groups and a singlet for the CH2, because the CH2 is in the middle and has equivalent environments on both sides. Wait, but that can't be right. Let me think. The protons on the CH2 would be between two equivalent CH3 groups. So each proton on CH2 would have neighboring CH3 groups. But in reality, the CH2 in propane is a -CH2- group, and the two CH3 groups are identical. So the CH2 protons would have neighboring CH3 groups, but due to the symmetry, the coupling would be between the two CH2 protons, leading to a singlet for the CH2. Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 protons would be a quartet due to coupling with the CH3 protons. Hmm, I'm getting myself confused. Let me think of the actual NMR spectrum of propane. I remember that propane has a singlet for the CH3 groups and a singlet for the CH2 because of symmetry. So the NMR of propane would show two singlets: one for the CH3 (integrated for 2H) and one for the CH2 (integrated for 2H). Wait, no. Wait, the actual structure is CH3-CH2-CH3. The two CH3 groups are equivalent, so their protons would be a singlet. The CH2 group is between two CH3 groups, so the protons on CH2 would only see each other and not the CH3, because the CH3 protons are on adjacent carbons. Wait, no. The coupling in NMR is through bonds, so the CH2 protons are next to the CH3. Each CH2 proton is adjacent to two CH3 groups, so each CH2 proton would couple with the CH3 protons. But since the CH3 groups are equivalent, the splitting would be a quartet for each CH2 proton. However, due to the symmetry, the CH2 protons are equivalent, so their signal would be a quartet. But wait, in reality, the CH2 in propane doesn't split because the coupling between CH2 and CH3 is usually not observed in 1H NMR due to the long distance. So the CH2 protons would be a singlet. So the NMR of propane would have two singlets: one from the CH3 (integral 6H) and one from the CH2 (integral 2H). Therefore, option C says D gives two singlets, which would be correct if D is propane.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. Ferric chloride test is for the presence of phenolic groups. Phenols give a yellow precipitate with FeCl3 due to the formation of a phenolic acid. So if H is a phenol, then option B is correct. But in our reaction sequence, have we introduced a phenol group? Let me see.

Assuming that compound E is propanol, and F is propene, then G would be some reaction product. Then, G reacts with NaOH to form H. If G is something like a diol, perhaps H is a carboxylic acid? Or maybe a different product.

Wait, perhaps I need to retrace the steps.

Let me try to outline the possible compounds:

A: CH2=CHCH3 (propene)
B: CH2Br-CHBr-CH3 (1,2-dibromopropane)
C: CH2=CHCH3 (propene) → but this would make D propane.
D: CH3CH2CH3 (propane)
E: ? (If D is propane, no reaction with two acids?)
Wait, maybe E is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about the elimination step. Maybe the elimination gives a different product. Let me try this again.

If B is 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2Br-CHBr-CH3), and elimination occurs, perhaps the product is 1-bromopropene (CH2Br-CH2-CH2?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the product is 2-bromopropene (CH2-CHBr-CH2?), but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to forming a different compound. For example, if the Br on C1 and C2 are eliminated, perhaps the product is 1,2-dibromopropane → 1,2-dipropene? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the product is 1-bromo-1-propene, which is CH2=CBrCH3.

Then, when this is passed through a red-hot iron tube, perhaps it's hydrogenated to CH2Br-CH2-CH3 (1-bromopropane), which is D.

Then, D reacts with two strong acids to form E. If D is 1-bromopropane, and the two acids are H2SO4 and H2O, then E would be propane-1-ol (CH3CH2CH2OH).

Then, E reacts with Fe and HCl to form F. Propane-1-ol with Fe and HCl? Well, Fe and HCl usually generate H2 gas. But with an alcohol, perhaps it's a substitution reaction. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a dehydration to form an alkene. So E (propanol) → F is propene (CH2=CHCH3).

Then, F (propene) reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2) to form G. Nitrous acid typically reacts with amines, but propene is an alkene. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is hydroxyamination, but that's for amines. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different reaction. Alternatively, maybe F is propane, but then reacting with nitrous acid... Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think about the reaction between propene and nitrous acid. Another possibility: nitrous acid can react with alkenes to form a diol, but that's in the presence of water and acid. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different reaction, like epoxidation, but that requires peracids. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydrohalogenation, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not with F being propene, but something else. Maybe I'm stuck here, so perhaps I should think about the options again.

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. Propene is used in the production of various chemicals, including some dyes. For example, propene is a precursor for polypropylene, but also for alkenes used in making certain dyes. So option A's statement could be correct.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. That suggests H is a phenol. But in our reaction sequence, have we introduced a phenol? I don't think so. So perhaps option B is incorrect.

Option C: D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR. If D is propane, yes, as discussed earlier, so option C is correct.

Option D: C is a flammable gas. If C is propene, yes, it's a gas and flammable. So option D is correct.

So the incorrect statement would be the one that is not true. If option B is claiming H is a phenol, but in reality, H is something else, then option B is incorrect.

So putting it all together, the incorrect statement is option B.

The reaction sequence begins with Compound A (C₃H₆), which is identified as propene (CH₂=CHCH₃). Bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride adds Br₂ across the double bond, forming 1,2-dibromopropane (CH₂Br-CHBr-CH₃) as Compound B. Reaction of B with alcoholic KOH leads to elimination, forming propene (CH₂=CHCH₃) as Compound C. Passing C through a red-hot iron tube likely hydrogenates the double bond, forming propane (CH₃CH₂CH₃) as Compound D. 

Compound D (propane) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids, but this step is unclear since propane typically does not react with strong acids. Assuming no reaction, Compound D remains propane. Compound D then reacts with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid, which may lead to the formation of a flammable gas like hydrogen, identified as Compound F. Reaction of F with nitrous acid (HNO₂) could form a compound G, though the exact nature of G is ambiguous. Finally, G reacts with NaOH to form Compound H.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. Propene (or its derivatives) is indeed used in the production of chemicals, including some dyes. This statement is plausible.
- **Option B**: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride solution. Ferric chloride test is for phenols, but no phenol is introduced in the reaction sequence. This statement is incorrect.
- **Option C**: D gives two singlets in the ¹H NMR spectra. Propane (CH₃CH₂CH₃) has a symmetric structure, and its ¹H NMR spectrum shows two singlets: one for the CH₃ groups and one for the CH₂ group. This statement is correct.
- **Option D**: C is a flammable gas. Propene (CH₂=CHCH₃) is a flammable gas. This statement is correct.

The incorrect statement is **Option B**, as there is no phenol introduced in the reaction sequence to give a yellow color with ferric chloride.

Answer: B

Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and think through each reaction.

The question starts with Compound A, which has the formula C3H6. Hmm, C3H6 is either propene or cyclopropane. Wait, no, cyclopropane would have a different structure. Oh wait, propene is C3H6 as well, right? Because propene is CH2=CHCH3, so it's an alkene.

So Compound A is C3H6, probably propene. Then it undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride. Oh, bromination with CCl4 is likely an addition reaction because propene is an alkene. So the bromine would add across the double bond, giving 1,2-dibromopropane. Wait, no, the addition of Br2 to propene would give 1,2-dibromopropane, but wait, propene is CH2=CH2CH3? Or CH2=CHCH3. Oh, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So when Br2 adds, it adds across the double bond, so the product would be BrCH2-CHBr-CH3. So that's compound B.

Then, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base, which usually leads to elimination reactions. So if B is 1,2-dibromopropane, when treated with alcoholic KOH, it would undergo dehydrohalogenation (elimination) to form an alkene. But wait, which one? Let's think. The structure is BrCH2-CHBr-CH3. When KOH is present, it would abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. The possible alkenes formed would depend on which H is removed. For 1,2-dibromopropane, the possible eliminations could form either 1-propene or 2-propene? Wait, no, wait. Let me imagine the structure. The molecule is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. When eliminating, the adjacent Br and H are removed. So upon elimination, the double bond forms between carbons 1 and 2 or 2 and 3?

Wait no, the dihalide is 1,2-dibromopropane, so the two Br are on C1 and C2. So when you eliminate, you can lose H from C2 and Br from C1, or H from C1 and Br from C2? Wait, but wait, no. The structure is CH2Br-CH2Br-CH3? No, if it's 1,2-dibromopropane, it's CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So the central carbon (C2) has a Br, and C1 also has a Br attached.

Wait, when you eliminate, you take a β hydrogen. So a hydrogen from a carbon adjacent to the Br. So for the Br on C1, the adjacent β hydrogens are on C2. Wait, maybe the structure is more like CH2Br-CH2Br-CH3? No, that would be 1,2,3-tribromopropane if both CH2 groups have Br. Wait, no, the original compound A is propene (CH2=CHCH3), and adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2Br-CHBr-CH3).

So when you treat this with alcoholic KOH, elimination occurs. Which positions? Let's see. The possible eliminations would form either propene or another di-substituted alkene. Wait, but 1,2-dibromopropane is vicinal dihalide. Eliminating H and Br from adjacent carbons would form a double bond between C1 and C2 or C2 and C3. Wait, but wait, in the molecule CH2Br-CHBr-CH3, each Br is on adjacent carbons. So when you eliminate, you can take a Br from C1 and a H from C2, leading to a double bond between C1 and C2. That would give CH2=CH-CH2Br? No, wait, no. Wait, elimination would form a double bond. Let me think again. If you have CH2Br-CHBr-CH3, and you eliminate Br and H from adjacent carbons, you form a double bond.

Wait, maybe it's better to draw this. The molecule is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. If KOH abstracts a H from C2, then the Br on C1 leaves, forming a double bond between C1 and C2. So the product would be CH2=CH-CH2Br? Or CH2=CH-CH3? Wait, no, because the Br is on C1 and C2. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, no, elimination would involve the loss of two substituents (Br and H) from adjacent carbons, leading to a double bond. So in CH2Br-CHBr-CH3, the possible elimination is between C1 and C2 or C2 and C3. Wait, if we lose H from C2 and Br from C1, that would form a double bond between C1 and C2. So that would give CH2=CH-CH2Br? No, wait, because the Br on C2 remains. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the elimination of H and Br from C2 and C3. So if H is removed from C3, Br from C2, then the double bond forms between C2 and C3. So the product would be CH2Br-CH2-CH2, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I should think of the structure as (CH2Br)CHBrCH3. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination can lead to 1-propene or 2-propene, but wait, 2-propene is actually propene again because propene is CH2=CHCH3. Wait, maybe the product is propene, but that can't be right because elimination of 1,2-dibromopropane would give 1,2-dipropene? No, no. Wait, maybe the product is 1-propene, which is propene.

Wait, perhaps in this case, the elimination of 1,2-dibromopropane would give propene. Because when you eliminate two Br's from adjacent positions, you form a double bond between those carbons.

Wait, an alternative approach: the addition of Br2 to propene forms 1,2-dibromopropane, and then elimination with KOH would form propene again. But that's possible only if the position is right.

Wait, but wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would form CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. Now, when treated with alcoholic KOH, which is a base, it would cause elimination. So the H would be removed from the adjacent carbon to Br. Let's say the H is on the same carbon as Br or adjacent. Wait, in this case, each Br is on a different carbon, and adjacent to each other.

So, for each Br on C1 and C2, the adjacent H would be on C2 and C1, respectively. So elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2, but that would require losing H from C2 and Br from C1, forming CH2=CHBr-CH3? That doesn't seem right.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the mechanism. The reaction is elimination, so it's an E2 mechanism. The base (KOH) abstracts a β hydrogen, and the leaving group (Br-) leaves, forming a double bond.

In CH2Br-CHBr-CH3, each Br is on C1 and C2. So for the Br on C1, the β hydrogens are on C2. So when KOH abstracts a β H from C2, the Br on C1 leaves, forming a double bond between C1 and C2. So the product is CH2=CHBr-CH3? No, wait, because the Br on C2 is still present. Hmm, that can't be right.

Wait a minute, maybe the structure is different. Oh! Wait, maybe when Br2 adds to propene, it adds across the double bond, giving 1,2-dibromopropane as CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. Then, when treated with KOH (alcoholic), the base abstracts a hydrogen, and the adjacent Br leaves. So, say, the H is abstracted from C2, the Br from C1 leaves, and the double bond forms between C1 and C2. So the product would be CH2=CH-CH2Br? Wait, but then there's still a Br on C3. No, wait, no. Because in the original compound, the Br's are on C1 and C2. So if the Br on C1 leaves, and a H on C2 leaves, the double bond would form between C1 and C2, so the structure becomes CH2=CH-CH2Br? No, wait, no. Because the Br on C2 is still there.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Maybe the addition of Br2 to propene gives 1,2-dibromopropane, which is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. Then elimination in alcoholic KOH would form 1-propene (which is the same as propene), but that doesn't make sense because that's the starting material. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a different position.

Wait, maybe when you eliminate, you can form 2-propene, but propene is already 1-propene. So perhaps the product is 1,2-dibromopropane → propene, but that's the same as the starting material. That seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a different diene, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe the elimination doesn't occur between C1 and C2 but between C2 and C3. But in the structure CH2Br-CHBr-CH3, C2 has a Br and is adjacent to C3 (which has CH3). So, if the H is abstracted from C3, the Br on C2 leaves, forming a double bond between C2 and C3. Then, the product would be CH2Br-CH2-CH2? No, wait, that can't be right. Alternatively, the product would be CH2Br-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C2 and C3, which would make it CH2Br-C=CH2. Wait, but that's 2-bromopropane-1, but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about what reaction forms what. So, propene (compound A) → bromination in CCl4 gives 1,2-dibromopropane (compound B). Then, B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Wait, alcoholic KOH is a base, so elimination. The product (compound C) would be an alkene. Since the starting material is 1,2-dibromopropane, the elimination would lead to 1-propene or 2-propene. But wait, 1-propene is the same as propene, which is the starting material. So maybe the product is 1,2-dibromopropane → when eliminated, forms 2-propene? No, wait, 2-propene is the same as propene since propene is CH2=CHCH3. So perhaps the product is propene again. But that doesn't make sense, does it?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the structure. Let's try again. Compound A is propene: CH2=CHCH3. Add Br2 in CCl4 → 1,2-dibromopropane: CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. Then, treatment with alcoholic KOH (which is a strong base) would cause dehydrohalogenation, eliminating HBr and forming a double bond. But since the two Brs are adjacent, eliminating would form a double bond between them, giving CH2=CHCH3 again, which is propene. But that's the same as compound A. So compound C would be propene. Hmm, but then the next step says compound C is passed through a red-hot iron tube to produce compound D.

Wait, passing an alkene through a red-hot iron tube is a condition for hydrogenation? Or maybe for something else. Wait, red-hot iron is usually used for catalytic hydrogenation. Wait, but in the presence of H2? Or perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation? No, I think the red-hot iron in the presence of H2 is used for hydrogenation, adding H2 across the double bond. But if compound C is propene, then passing it over red-hot iron (like a catalyst) with H2 would hydrogenate it to propane. But the question doesn't mention adding H2. Wait, maybe it's a different reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the red-hot iron is used for dehydrogenation, but that's for forming alkenes, not alkanes.

Wait, maybe the reaction is something else. Oh, wait, another possibility is that when an alkene is passed through a red-hot iron tube without hydrogen, it might cause a reaction, like cracking or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation, but that doesn't fit here.

Wait, wait. Maybe compound C is not propene. Let me think again. Maybe the elimination from 1,2-dibromopropane gives a different product. Oh! Wait, perhaps I was wrong about the structure of compound B. Because when Br2 is added to propene, it could form 1,2-dibromopropane, but maybe in a different configuration. Or perhaps it's not an addition but a substitution. Wait, no, in the presence of CCl4, it's likely a diaddition across the double bond, giving 1,2-dibromopropane.

Wait, perhaps the elimination product isn't propene but another di-substituted alkene. Wait, perhaps it's 2-bromopropene or something else. No, perhaps the product is 2-bromopropene? Let me think. Elimination from 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2Br-CHBr-CH3) would form either 1-propene or 2-propene, but I'm not getting it right. Alternatively, perhaps the product is 1-bromo-1-propene.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me think step by step again.

1. Compound A: C3H6. Structure is propene (CH2=CHCH3).
2. Bromination (Br2 in CCl4): adds across double bond → 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2Br-CHBr-CH3).
3. Reaction with alcoholic KOH: elimination, so we lose HBr. The product is an alkene. Since the dihalide is 1,2-dibromopropane, elimination would likely form 1-propene (CH2=CHCH3) again. So compound C is propene.

Then, compound C (propene) is passed through a red-hot iron tube. Hmm. Red-hot iron is a catalyst for hydrogenation. So if H2 is present, propene would hydrogenate to propane. But the problem doesn't mention H2. So maybe the reaction is something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrogenation reaction, but I don't think so. Alternatively, perhaps the red-hot iron is used for another purpose, like cracking, but that's more for breaking down larger hydrocarbons.

Wait, maybe the reaction is dehydrogenation, which would form something else. For example, propene to form something else? Wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. Passing it over a red-hot iron might be a catalyst for some reaction. Wait, another possibility: the iron might cause the alkene to undergo a polymerization reaction, but that's more for making plastics, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about other possibilities. If compound C is propene (CH2=CHCH3), and it's passed through a red-hot iron tube, maybe it's hydrogenated to propane (CH3CH2CH3), which would be compound D. Then, compound D is propane.

Next, compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form compound E. Hmm, reacting propane with two strong acids? That doesn't seem right. Propane is an alkane, so it typically doesn't react with acids. Unless under certain conditions. Wait, perhaps the mixture of acids is H2SO4 and H2O, which would lead to sulfonation, but that's for aromatic compounds. Propane doesn't have aromatic rings, so that's unlikely.

Wait, maybe the two strong acids are H2SO4 and HNO3 or something else. Another thought: maybe D is propane, and the two strong acids are H2SO4 and H2O, perhaps leading to some sulfonation, but I don't think it applies here. Alternatively, maybe D is something else, and I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let me go back. Perhaps compound C is something else. Did I make a mistake in the elimination step? Let me think again. So, compound B is 1,2-dibromopropane. When treated with alcoholic KOH, elimination occurs. The possible products are 1-propene (propene) or 2-propene (but that's the same as propene). Alternatively, perhaps the product is 2-bromopropene? No, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination doesn't occur between the two Brs but elsewhere. Wait, maybe the structure of compound B is different. Let me think again. If propene is CH2=CHCH3, and Br2 adds across the double bond, the product is CH2BrCHBrCH3. Then, when KOH is added, elimination occurs. Which positions?

Wait, maybe the elimination occurs between C2 and C3. So, taking a hydrogen from C3, and Br from C2. That would form a double bond between C2 and C3, giving CH2Br-C=CH2. So the product would be 2-bromo-1-propene. Wait, but that's not possible because the starting material was 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2Br-CHBr-CH3). So eliminating H from C3 and Br from C2 would form CH2Br-C=CH2. But that would leave a Br on C1, so the structure would be CH2Br-CBr=CH2? No, wait, no, because the Br is eliminated.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of it as a mechanism. In E2 elimination, the base abstracts a β hydrogen, and the leaving group (Br-) departs, forming a double bond. So, in CH2Br-CHBr-CH3, each Br is on C1 and C2. So for each Br, the β hydrogens are on adjacent carbons.

So, for the Br on C1, β hydrogens are on C2. So, if the base abstracts a H from C2, Br on C1 leaves, forming a double bond between C1 and C2. So the product would be CH2=CH-CH2Br? But wait, that leaves a Br on C3. Wait, no, the original structure is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So if Br on C1 and H on C2 are eliminated, the product would be CH2=CH-CH3, but that would require the Br on C2 to stay. Wait, no, because elimination involves losing H and Br from adjacent carbons. So, the product would have a double bond between C1 and C2, and lose HBr. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2Br? No, because that would require the Br on C3.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of the structure as:

Original B: CH2Br-CHBr-CH3.

Elimination occurs between C1 and C2, losing H from C2 and Br from C1. So the structure becomes CH2=CBr-CH3. Wait, no, that's not right because that would leave a Br on C2. Wait, maybe the product is CH2=CH-CH2Br. No, that's not possible because the Br would be on C3, which wasn't present in B.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of 1,2-dibromopropane → 1,2-dipropene? No, that doesn't make sense.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe it's better to think that the elimination leads to 1-propene (i.e., the same as compound A). So compound C is propene (CH2=CHCH3). Then, passing it through a red-hot iron tube would hydrogenate it to propane (CH3CH2CH3), which is compound D.

Then, compound D (propane) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form compound E. Wait, but how? Propane is an alkane, and typically doesn't react with strong acids. Unless under some specific conditions. Alternatively, perhaps the two strong acids are H2SO4 and HNO3, which could cause some sulfonation or nitration, but that typically requires aromatic rings or double bonds, which propane lacks. So perhaps I'm wrong about compound C.

Alternatively, maybe the elimination doesn't give propene but another compound. Let me think again: perhaps the product of elimination from 1,2-dibromopropane is 2-bromopropene. Wait, that might make sense. So, structure would be CH2Br-C=CH2. Then, when you pass this through a red-hot iron tube, what happens? Maybe it's hydrogenated to CH2Br-CH2-CH3, which is 1-bromopropane.

But then, compound D would be 1-bromopropane. Then, reacting with a mixture of two strong acids. Hmm, 1-bromopropane with strong acids... Maybe it undergoes hydrolysis. If the strong acids are H2SO4 and H2O, it could undergo hydrolysis to form propane-1-ol. But then, reaction with two strong acids, perhaps H2SO4 and HNO3... Not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm on the wrong track. Let me try a different approach. Let me go through each step, assuming that the reaction produces certain compounds, and then see which options are incorrect.

So, starting over:

1. A is C3H6. It's propene → CH2=CHCH3.
2. Bromination in CCl4 → 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2Br-CHBr-CH3) → B.
3. B reacts with alcoholic KOH → elimination → forms an alkene. So, the product C is (probably) propene again (CH2=CHCH3), but that seems like a loop. Hmm, but if that's the case, then:
4. Passing C through red-hot iron → hydrogenation to propane (D: CH3CH2CH3).
5. D (propane) reacts with two strong acids → E. But I don't see a reaction here, so perhaps I'm wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps step 3 gives a different product. Maybe elimination from 1,2-dibromopropane gives 1-bromopropene (CH2Br-CH2-CH2?), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is 1,2-dibromopropane → elimination gives 1-bromo-1-propene (CH2=CBrCH3). Then, when passed over red-hot iron, perhaps hydrogenation occurs, adding H2 to form CH2Br-CH2-CH3 (1-bromopropane) → D.

Then, D reacts with two strong acids. If the acids are H2SO4 and H2O, it would hydrolyze to form propanol. But that's a substitution reaction, but with strong acid and water. Wait, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution. 1-bromopropane in presence of strong acid and water would undergo SN1 or SN2 hydrolysis to form propane-1-ol (CH3CH2CH2OH). So E would be propanol.

Then, E (propanol) reacts with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid to form F. Iron and HCl usually cause a reaction, perhaps acid-catalyzed dehydration. Propanol (E) with H2SO4 (as acid) and heat would dehydrate to form propene (CH2=CHCH3) → which is compound F.

Then, F (propene) reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2) to form G. Nitrous acid is typically used for diazotization, but that's for aromatic amines. Wait, but propene is an alkene. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is hydroxyamination or something else. Wait, another possibility: nitrous acid can react with alkenes in the presence of a catalyst to form a diol, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction. Wait, another thought: perhaps F is propene, which reacts with nitrous acid under certain conditions to form something else, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe F is propane, but that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again:

If E is propanol, and F is formed by reacting E with iron scrap and HCl. Iron and HCl typically produce FeCl2 and H2 gas. But in the presence of an alcohol, perhaps it's a substitution reaction. Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but that would require a halogen. Alternatively, perhaps it's a catalytic dehydrogenation, converting the alcohol to an alkene. Propanol (E) → with Fe and HCl, perhaps it's heated to form propene (F: CH2=CHCH3). Then, F (propene) reacts with nitrous acid. Hmm, but propene doesn't react with HNO2 under normal conditions. Maybe it's a different compound.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about E. Let me think again. If D is 1-bromopropane, and E is propanol, then F would be propene via dehydration. Then, G would be the product of propene reacting with nitrous acid. But I'm not sure what that would be. Alternatively, perhaps F is propane, but then reacting with nitrous acid... Not likely.

Alternatively, maybe the sequence is different. Let me think about the options given and see which ones might be incorrect.

The options are:

A) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.
B) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.
C) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.
D) C is a flammable gas.

Let me analyze each option.

Option D: C is a flammable gas. If C is propene (CH2=CHCH3), which is a gas and highly flammable, then D is correct. So option D's statement is correct, so it can't be the incorrect statement.

Option C: D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR. If D is propane (CH3CH2CH3), its NMR would show a triplet for the CH2 and a triplet for the CH3, but wait, no. Wait, propane's structure is CH3-CH2-CH3. The NMR would show a singlet for the CH3 groups on both ends because of symmetry. The middle CH2 would be between two equivalent CH3 groups, so it would be a quartet. Wait, no, wait. When you have CH3-CH2-CH3, the CH2 group is adjacent to two CH3 groups. So the CH2 would split into a quartet, but due to symmetry, the CH2 might appear as a singlet. Wait, no. Wait, in NMR, the middle CH2 in propane would have neighboring CH3 groups, so each CH2 proton would see two adjacent CH3 groups. The splitting would be into a quartet, but due to the two adjacent CH3 groups being equivalent, the quartet would split into a triplet. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, in propane, each CH3 group is attached to a CH2. The CH2 has two protons, each seeing the two CH3 groups. Wait, but in reality, the CH2 in propane is a single group, and the NMR would show a singlet for the CH3 groups and a singlet for the CH2, because the CH2 is in the middle and has equivalent environments on both sides. Wait, but that can't be right. Let me think. The protons on the CH2 would be between two equivalent CH3 groups. So each proton on CH2 would have neighboring CH3 groups. But in reality, the CH2 in propane is a -CH2- group, and the two CH3 groups are identical. So the CH2 protons would have neighboring CH3 groups, but due to the symmetry, the coupling would be between the two CH2 protons, leading to a singlet for the CH2. Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 protons would be a quartet due to coupling with the CH3 protons. Hmm, I'm getting myself confused. Let me think of the actual NMR spectrum of propane. I remember that propane has a singlet for the CH3 groups and a singlet for the CH2 because of symmetry. So the NMR of propane would show two singlets: one for the CH3 (integrated for 2H) and one for the CH2 (integrated for 2H). Wait, no. Wait, the actual structure is CH3-CH2-CH3. The two CH3 groups are equivalent, so their protons would be a singlet. The CH2 group is between two CH3 groups, so the protons on CH2 would only see each other and not the CH3, because the CH3 protons are on adjacent carbons. Wait, no. The coupling in NMR is through bonds, so the CH2 protons are next to the CH3. Each CH2 proton is adjacent to two CH3 groups, so each CH2 proton would couple with the CH3 protons. But since the CH3 groups are equivalent, the splitting would be a quartet for each CH2 proton. However, due to the symmetry, the CH2 protons are equivalent, so their signal would be a quartet. But wait, in reality, the CH2 in propane doesn't split because the coupling between CH2 and CH3 is usually not observed in 1H NMR due to the long distance. So the CH2 protons would be a singlet. So the NMR of propane would have two singlets: one from the CH3 (integral 6H) and one from the CH2 (integral 2H). Therefore, option C says D gives two singlets, which would be correct if D is propane.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. Ferric chloride test is for the presence of phenolic groups. Phenols give a yellow precipitate with FeCl3 due to the formation of a phenolic acid. So if H is a phenol, then option B is correct. But in our reaction sequence, have we introduced a phenol group? Let me see.

Assuming that compound E is propanol, and F is propene, then G would be some reaction product. Then, G reacts with NaOH to form H. If G is something like a diol, perhaps H is a carboxylic acid? Or maybe a different product.

Wait, perhaps I need to retrace the steps.

Let me try to outline the possible compounds:

A: CH2=CHCH3 (propene)
B: CH2Br-CHBr-CH3 (1,2-dibromopropane)
C: CH2=CHCH3 (propene) → but this would make D propane.
D: CH3CH2CH3 (propane)
E: ? (If D is propane, no reaction with two acids?)
Wait, maybe E is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about the elimination step. Maybe the elimination gives a different product. Let me try this again.

If B is 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2Br-CHBr-CH3), and elimination occurs, perhaps the product is 1-bromopropene (CH2Br-CH2-CH2?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the product is 2-bromopropene (CH2-CHBr-CH2?), but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to forming a different compound. For example, if the Br on C1 and C2 are eliminated, perhaps the product is 1,2-dibromopropane → 1,2-dipropene? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the product is 1-bromo-1-propene, which is CH2=CBrCH3.

Then, when this is passed through a red-hot iron tube, perhaps it's hydrogenated to CH2Br-CH2-CH3 (1-bromopropane), which is D.

Then, D reacts with two strong acids to form E. If D is 1-bromopropane, and the two acids are H2SO4 and H2O, then E would be propane-1-ol (CH3CH2CH2OH).

Then, E reacts with Fe and HCl to form F. Propane-1-ol with Fe and HCl? Well, Fe and HCl usually generate H2 gas. But with an alcohol, perhaps it's a substitution reaction. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a dehydration to form an alkene. So E (propanol) → F is propene (CH2=CHCH3).

Then, F (propene) reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2) to form G. Nitrous acid typically reacts with amines, but propene is an alkene. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is hydroxyamination, but that's for amines. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different reaction. Alternatively, maybe F is propane, but then reacting with nitrous acid... Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think about the reaction between propene and nitrous acid. Another possibility: nitrous acid can react with alkenes to form a diol, but that's in the presence of water and acid. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different reaction, like epoxidation, but that requires peracids. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydrohalogenation, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not with F being propene, but something else. Maybe I'm stuck here, so perhaps I should think about the options again.

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. Propene is used in the production of various chemicals, including some dyes. For example, propene is a precursor for polypropylene, but also for alkenes used in making certain dyes. So option A's statement could be correct.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. That suggests H is a phenol. But in our reaction sequence, have we introduced a phenol? I don't think so. So perhaps option B is incorrect.

Option C: D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR. If D is propane, yes, as discussed earlier, so option C is correct.

Option D: C is a flammable gas. If C is propene, yes, it's a gas and flammable. So option D is correct.

So the incorrect statement would be the one that is not true. If option B is claiming H is a phenol, but in reality, H is something else, then option B is incorrect.

So putting it all together, the incorrect statement is option B.


The reaction sequence begins with Compound A (C₃H₆), which is identified as propene (CH₂=CHCH₃). Bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride adds Br₂ across the double bond, forming 1,2-dibromopropane (CH₂Br-CHBr-CH₃) as Compound B. Reaction of B with alcoholic KOH leads to elimination, forming propene (CH₂=CHCH₃) as Compound C. Passing C through a red-hot iron tube likely hydrogenates the double bond, forming propane (CH₃CH₂CH₃) as Compound D. 

Compound D (propane) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids, but this step is unclear since propane typically does not react with strong acids. Assuming no reaction, Compound D remains propane. Compound D then reacts with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid, which may lead to the formation of a flammable gas like hydrogen, identified as Compound F. Reaction of F with nitrous acid (HNO₂) could form a compound G, though the exact nature of G is ambiguous. Finally, G reacts with NaOH to form Compound H.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. Propene (or its derivatives) is indeed used in the production of chemicals, including some dyes. This statement is plausible.
- **Option B**: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride solution. Ferric chloride test is for phenols, but no phenol is introduced in the reaction sequence. This statement is incorrect.
- **Option C**: D gives two singlets in the ¹H NMR spectra. Propane (CH₃CH₂CH₃) has a symmetric structure, and its ¹H NMR spectrum shows two singlets: one for the CH₃ groups and one for the CH₂ group. This statement is correct.
- **Option D**: C is a flammable gas. Propene (CH₂=CHCH₃) is a flammable gas. This statement is correct.

The incorrect statement is **Option B**, as there is no phenol introduced in the reaction sequence to give a yellow color with ferric chloride.
