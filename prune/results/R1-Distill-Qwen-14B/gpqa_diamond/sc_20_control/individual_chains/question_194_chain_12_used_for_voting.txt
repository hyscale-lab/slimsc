Okay, so I've got this problem about spins and the partition function. Hmm, let me try to think through it. Alright, so the system has three spins, S1, S2, S3. Each can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ]. I need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), right? Beta is 1/(kT). So, each state contributes a term based on its energy.

But wait, how do I determine all possible states and their energies? Each spin has two possible values, so for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. But maybe some of these have the same energy, so I can group them.

Hmm, let's list all possible states and compute their energies. Each state is a combination of S1, S2, S3 being +1 or -1.

Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way. Let's think about the possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Each term S_i S_j is either +1 or -1. For example, if S1=S2, then S1S2=+1, else -1.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the number of pairs that are aligned or not. Let me see.

Wait, let's consider the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Let me compute this for all possible cases.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the possible values of the sum and how many states correspond to each value.

Let me think: for three spins, the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can take certain values. Let's compute that.

Wait, another approach: the expression can be rewritten as (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2) ) / 2. Because (a+b+c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + ac + bc). So, ab + ac + bc = [ (a+b+c)^2 - (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) ] / 2.

Since each S is either +1 or -1, S_i^2 =1. So the sum becomes [ (S1+S2+S3)^2 - 3 ] / 2.

So the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 is equal to [M^2 -3]/2, where M = S1 + S2 + S3.

So the energy E is -J * [ (M^2 -3)/2 ].

Which simplifies to E = (3J - J M^2 ) / 2.

Hmm, but M can take on certain values. Since each S is ±1, the sum M can be -3, -1, +1, +3. Because with three spins, the maximum is 3 (all +1) and the minimum is -3 (all -1). But what about the possible M values? Let's see:

If all three spins are +1: M=3

Two +1, one -1: M=+1

One +1, two -1: M=-1

All -1: M=-3

Wait, so M can be 3, 1, -1, -3.

Wait, no: M is S1 + S2 + S3. Each S_i is ±1. So possible M values are:

3 (all +1)

+1 (two +1, one -1)

-1 (two -1, one +1)

-3 (all -1)

So M can be 3, 1, -1, -3.

But let's compute for each M, how many states have that M.

Wait, for M=3: only 1 state (all +1).

M=1: how many states? It's the number of ways to have two +1 and one -1. That's 3 choose 1 = 3 states.

Similarly, M=-1: 3 states (two -1 and one +1).

M=-3: 1 state (all -1).

So that's 8 states in total (1+3+3+1=8), which makes sense.

Now, the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 is (M^2 -3)/2. So let's compute that for each M.

When M=3: M² =9. So sum is (9-3)/2 = 6/2=3.

So E = -J *3.

When M=1: M²=1. Sum is (1-3)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1.

So E = -J*(-1) = J.

When M=-1: same as M=1, since M² is same.

E= J.

When M=-3: same as M=3, E=-3J.

So each state's energy depends on whether M is ±3 or ±1.

Wait, but wait. Let me plug in the numbers:

For M=3, E = (3J - J*(3)^2 ) / 2 → (3J -9J)/2 = (-6J)/2= -3J.

Wait, no, wait I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me go back.

The sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (M^2 -3)/2. So when M=3, sum is (9-3)/2=3. So E = -J *3 = -3J.

When M=1, sum is (1-3)/2= (-1), so E = -J*(-1) = J.

So for M=3: energy is -3J.

For M=1: energy is J.

Similarly, M=-1: same as M=1, so energy J.

M=-3: same as M=3, energy -3J.

So each state contributes to the partition function.

So now, for each M, how many states have that energy, and what's the energy.

Looking at M:

M=3: 1 state, E=-3J.

M=1: 3 states, E=+J.

M=-1: 3 states, E=+J.

M=-3: 1 state, E=-3J.

So for each state, the energy is either -3J or J.

So the partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp( -β E ), which is the same as exp( β J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3) ), because E = -J[...], so -β E = β J (...).

Wait, but let me compute it step by step.

Partition function Z = sum_{all states} exp( -β E )

Each state has E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 )

So exp(-β E ) = exp( β J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3) )

But for each state, (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3) can be 3 or -1, as we saw.

Wait, wait, when M=3, sum is 3, so exp( β J *3 )

When M=1, sum is -1, so exp( β J * (-1) ) = exp( -β J )

So for each state with M=3, the contribution is exp(3 β J )

For each state with M=1, the contribution is exp(- β J )

Similarly, M=-1 gives the same as M=1, same energy.

M=-3 gives same as M=3.

So how many states contribute each term?

M=3: 1 state with exp(3 β J )

M=-3: 1 state with exp(3 β J )? Wait no. Wait, when M=-3, sum is ( (-3)^2 -3 ) /2 = (9-3)/2=3. So sum is 3. So E= -J *3 → same as M=3. So exp(3β J )

Wait, but for M=-3, the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 is same as M=3. So both M=3 and M=-3 states contribute exp(3 β J).

But wait, no, let me re-calculate.

Wait, when M=3, all spins are +1. So S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum is 3. So E= -J *3.

For M=-3, all spins are -1. S1S2=1 (since (-1)(-1)=1), same for all pairs. Sum is also 3. So E=-3J. So both M=3 and M=-3 states have sum=3, E=-3J.

So for M=3 and M=-3, each contributes exp(3 β J )

Wait, no, because E is -3J. So exp(-β E )= exp(3 β J )

So for M=3 and M=-3, each state contributes exp(3 β J )

Wait, but M=3: 1 state → contributes 1 term of exp(3 β J )

M=-3: 1 state → another term of exp(3 β J )

So together, these 2 states contribute 2 * exp(3 β J )

Similarly, for M=1 and M=-1, each state has sum S= -1. So E= J.

So for each of those 3 + 3 =6 states, the contribution is exp(-β J )

So the total Z is:

Z = [2 * exp(3 β J ) ] + [6 * exp( -β J ) ]

So looking at the options:

Option A) Z= 2 e^(-3Jβ) +6e^(Jβ )

Option B) Z= 2 e^(3Jβ ) +6 e^(-Jβ )

Option C) Z= 2e^(2Jβ)+6e^(-2Jβ )

Option D) Z= 6e^(2Jβ)+2e^(-2Jβ )

So our result is 2 e^{3 β J} + 6 e^{-β J }, which matches option B.

Wait, but let me make sure. The options are:

Option B is 2 e^{3Jβ} +6e^{-Jβ}, which is what we have.

So the answer should be option B.

Wait, but wait a minute, let me recheck.

Wait, the energy E for a state is -J times the sum. The sum is 3 for M=3 and M=-3. So E is -3J.

So when I compute exp(-β E ), it's exp(3 β J ), correct.

Similarly, for M=1 and M=-1, the sum is -1, so E is J. So exp(-β E )= exp(-β J )

So the terms are 2 * e^{3 J β} +6 e^{- J β }, which is option B.

Yes, that's correct.

To determine the partition function \( Z \) for the given system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), each of which can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), we start by analyzing the energy expression:

\[
E = -J \left( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \right).
\]

The partition function is defined as:

\[
Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} e^{-\beta E},
\]

where \( \beta = \frac{1}{kT} \). Each spin configuration corresponds to a state, and there are \( 2^3 = 8 \) possible states for the three spins.

### Step 1: Compute the energy for each state
The energy depends on the sum \( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \). This sum can be rewritten as:

\[
S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 = \frac{M^2 - 3}{2},
\]

where \( M = S_1 + S_2 + S_3 \). Since each \( S_i \) is \( \pm 1 \), \( M \) can take the values \( 3, 1, -1, -3 \), corresponding to the total spin of the system.

- For \( M = 3 \) (all spins \( +1 \)): \( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 = 3 \), so \( E = -3J \).
- For \( M = 1 \) (two \( +1 \), one \( -1 \)): \( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 = -1 \), so \( E = J \).
- For \( M = -1 \) (two \( -1 \), one \( +1 \)): \( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 = -1 \), so \( E = J \).
- For \( M = -3 \) (all spins \( -1 \)): \( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 = 3 \), so \( E = -3J \).

### Step 2: Count the number of states for each energy
- \( M = 3 \): 1 state.
- \( M = 1 \): 3 states.
- \( M = -1 \): 3 states.
- \( M = -3 \): 1 state.

Thus:
- Energy \( E = -3J \): 2 states (one for \( M = 3 \), one for \( M = -3 \)).
- Energy \( E = J \): 6 states (three for \( M = 1 \), three for \( M = -1 \)).

### Step 3: Compute the partition function
The partition function is the sum over all states of \( e^{-\beta E} \). For each energy:

- For \( E = -3J \): Contribution is \( 2e^{3\beta J} \).
- For \( E = J \): Contribution is \( 6e^{-\beta J} \).

Thus, the partition function is:

\[
Z = 2e^{3\beta J} + 6e^{-\beta J}.
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
Comparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:

**Option B: \( Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta} \).**

Answer: B
