Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. The states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σ_z. I need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σ_z + 5σ_x up to one decimal place.

Hmm, expectation values. Right, I remember that the expectation value of an operator is the average value you'd expect to measure. For a given state, you calculate it by taking the conjugate transpose (bra) of the state, multiplying by the operator, and then multiplying by the state (ket). So it's ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, where O is the operator.

The operator here is 10σ_z +5σ_x. So I think I'll need to compute the expectation value of each part separately and then add them together.

Wait, but σ_z and σ_x are Pauli matrices. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices. So I should figure out what σ_z and σ_x are.

From what I remember, σ_z is [[1, 0], [0, -1]], and σ_x is [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. Let me write them down:

σ_z = [[1, 0],
        [0, -1]]

σ_x = [[0, 1],
        [1, 0]]

So the operator O becomes O = 10 σ_z +5 σ_x. Let me compute that. So O would be:

10*[[1, 0], [0, -1]] + 5*[[0, 1], [1, 0]]
= [[10*1 +5*0, 10*0 +5*1],
   [10*0 +5*1, 10*(-1) +5*0]]
Which simplifies to:
[[10, 5],
 [5, -10]]

So O is a 2x2 matrix with elements [10,5;5,-10].

But wait, maybe I don't need the matrix directly. Because the expectation value is ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩. Alternatively, since O is 10σ_z +5σ_x, I can compute the expectation value of each part separately and sum them.

Because expectation values are linear, so ⟨A + B⟩ = ⟨A⟩ + ⟨B⟩, right? So maybe it's easier to compute ⟨σ_z⟩ and ⟨σ_x⟩ separately and then combine them.

So let's do that. First, let me find ⟨σ_z⟩.

The state ψ is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let me write this in vector form. Since |↑⟩ is the eigenstate of σ_z with eigenvalue +1, and |↓⟩ is the eigenstate with eigenvalue -1.

Wait, so |↑⟩ is [1; 0], and |↓⟩ is [0; 1]. So ψ is a vector [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

Because ψ = 0.5 [1;0] + (sqrt(3)/2) [0;1] = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

So to compute ⟨σ_z⟩, which is the expectation value for σ_z. But since σ_z has eigenvalues 1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, the expectation value is just the probability of measuring +1 times 1 plus the probability of measuring -1 times (-1).

Wait, but the state is given as a superposition. So the probabilities are the squares of the amplitudes.

Looking at ψ, the coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. So the probability of |↑⟩ is (0.5)^2 = 0.25, and of |↓⟩ is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4 = 0.75.

So ⟨σ_z⟩ = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

Wait that's cool. So that's the expectation value for σ_z.

Now, for σ_x. The expectation value ⟨σ_x⟩ is a bit trickier. Because |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σ_z, not σ_x. So we can't directly compute it like we did for σ_z.

I think I need to compute it using the matrix representation. So first, let me write ψ as a column vector: [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

Then, the expectation value of σ_x would be ψ† σ_x ψ. Let's compute that.

Alternatively, σ_x is the Pauli X matrix, which swaps the basis states. So ψ in the σ_z basis is [a, b]^T. Then, σ_x ψ would be [b, a]^T. So, let me compute ψ† σ_x ψ.

Wait, let me compute it step by step. ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

Compute ψ† σ_x ψ: take the conjugate transpose of ψ (which, since the coefficients are real, is just the transpose) multiplied by σ_x, then multiplied by ψ.

So, ψ† σ_x = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] multiplied by σ_x.

Wait, σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So ψ† σ_x would be [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] multiplied by that matrix.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, matrix multiplication is associative. So ψ† is a 1x2 matrix. σ_x is 2x2. So ψ† σ_x is 1x2.

Let me compute that:

ψ† σ_x = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [[0,1],[1,0]]

So, each element is sum of products. Let's compute each element:

First element (row 1, column 1): 0.5*0 + sqrt(3)/2 *1 = sqrt(3)/2.

Second element (row 1, column 2): 0.5*1 + sqrt(3)/2 *0 = 0.5.

So ψ† σ_x is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5].

Then, multiply this by ψ, which is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

So, (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 + (0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) = 0.5 (sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3)/2) = 0.5 * sqrt(3) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, that's the calculation for ⟨σ_x⟩. So approximately 0.866.

But wait, let me check that calculation again. Because sometimes I get mixed up with how the matrices multiply.

Another way: The expectation value of σ_x is (a*b' + a'*b), where a is the amplitude of |↑⟩ and b is the amplitude of |↓⟩. Because σ_x is the swap operator, so in the σ_z basis, its expectation is 2 Re(a b*), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, for any state ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, the expectation value of σ_x is (a b* + a* b). Since a and b are real in this case, it's 2ab.

Wait yes, because |↑⟩ is [1;0], |↓⟩ is [0;1]. So ψ is [a; b], with a=0.5, b= sqrt(3)/2.

So σ_x is the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. So ψ† σ_x ψ is a^2 *0 + a*b*1 + b*a*1 + b^2 *0. Wait, no, that's the matrix multiplication. Let me compute it as (a [1 0] + b [0 1]) σ_x (a [1;0] + b[0;1]).

Alternatively, the expectation value is (a b + a b) because when you multiply, the cross terms are a*b and b*a, so 2 a b.

Wait, when you compute ψ† σ_x ψ, it's a times b plus b times a, because the cross terms. So that's 2ab.

In our case, a is 0.5, b is sqrt(3)/2. So 2 * 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) = 2*(0.5)*(0.866...) = 0.866..., which is approximately 0.866. So that's correct.

So ⟨σ_x⟩ is 2ab = 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) ) = (sqrt(3)/2) ≈ 0.866.

So putting it all together, the expectation value of the operator O=10σ_z +5σ_x is:

⟨O⟩ = 10⟨σ_z⟩ +5⟨σ_x⟩.

We have ⟨σ_z⟩= -0.5, ⟨σ_x⟩≈0.866.

So 10*(-0.5) is -5. And 5*(0.866) is 4.33.

Adding those together: -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.

Wait, wait, that's negative 0.67. But let's do the exact calculation to avoid rounding errors.

Wait, sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732.

So 2ab = 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) = (sqrt(3)/2). So sqrt(3) is about 1.732, so 1.732/2 is 0.866.

So 5*(0.866)=4.33.

But wait, maybe I should be more precise with the exact value.

Wait, let's compute it exactly. Let me re-calculate ⟨σ_x⟩.

ψ is 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)| ↓⟩.

So when you compute ψ† σ_x ψ, which is (0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*(0.5) = 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) = (sqrt(3)/2). So sqrt(3) is about 1.73205, so sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.8660254.

So 5 multiplied by that is 5 * 0.8660254 ≈4.330127.

Now, 10*(⟨σ_z⟩)=10*(-0.5)= -5.

Adding them: -5 +4.330127 = -0.669873.

Which is approximately -0.67.

Wait, but the problem says to provide the expectation value up to one decimal place. So -0.67 rounds to -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place. Because 0.67 is closer to 0.7 than 0.6 when rounded to one decimal.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 0.67 is 0.7 when rounded to one decimal place. Because the second decimal is 7, which is 5 or more, so we round up. So -0.67 becomes approximately -0.7.

But let me double-check the exact calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of ⟨σ_x⟩. Let me recompute.

Alternatively, perhaps I should directly compute ψ† (10σ_z +5σ_x) ψ.

Alternatively, ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

So the operator O is 10σ_z +5σ_x, which as a matrix is:

10*[[1, 0], [0, -1]] +5*[[0,1],[1,0]] = [[10,5],[5,-10]].

So now, the expectation value is ψ† O ψ.

Compute that as:

[0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [[10,5],[5,-10]] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

First, compute the matrix multiplication of O and ψ.

The matrix O is:

Row 1: 10,5.

Row 2:5, -10.

So O * ψ is:

First element: 10*0.5 +5*(sqrt(3)/2) =5 + (5 sqrt(3))/2 ≈5 + (8.660)/2=5+4.330=9.330.

Wait, but wait, it's O multiplied by ψ, which is a column vector. So let me compute each component:

Top element: 10*(0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2) =5 + (5 sqrt(3))/2.

Bottom element:5*(0.5) + (-10)*(sqrt(3)/2) =2.5 -5 sqrt(3).

So the result of Oψ is:

[5 + (5 sqrt(3))/2,

 2.5 -5 sqrt(3) ].

Then, ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

So the expectation value is ψ† (Oψ) = 0.5*(5 + (5 sqrt(3))/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*(2.5 -5 sqrt(3)).

Let me compute each term.

First term: 0.5*(5) =2.5.

0.5*(5 sqrt(3)/2 )= (5 sqrt(3))/4 ≈ (8.660)/4≈2.165.

Second term: sqrt(3)/2 *2.5 = (2.5 sqrt(3))/2 ≈ (4.330)/2=2.165.

Third term: sqrt(3)/2 * (-5 sqrt(3)) = (-5*3)/2 = (-15)/2 = -7.5.

So adding all terms:

2.5 + 2.165 + 2.165 -7.5.

Let me compute:

2.5 +2.165 =4.665.

4.665 +2.165=6.83.

6.83 -7.5= -0.67.

So again, I get -0.67. So rounded to one decimal place, that's -0.7.

Looking at the options, option C is -0.7.

Wait, but I thought the options were:

A) -1.4

B) 1.65

C) -0.7

D) 0.85

So the correct answer would be C) -0.7.

Wait, but earlier I thought 10σ_z gives -5 and 5σ_x gives +4.33, so their sum is -0.67, which rounds to -0.7. That's correct.

So the answer is C.

To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( O = 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given spin-half particle state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are eigenstates of \( \sigma_z \). The expectation value is computed as \( \langle O \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle \).

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
The eigenvalues of \( \sigma_z \) are \( +1 \) for \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( -1 \) for \( |\downarrow\rangle \). The probabilities of measuring \( +1 \) and \( -1 \) are the squares of the coefficients of \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \), respectively:
- Probability of \( +1 \): \( |0.5|^2 = 0.25 \)
- Probability of \( -1 \): \( \left|\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right|^2 = 0.75 \)

Thus,  
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is given by:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2ab
\]
where \( a = 0.5 \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \) are the coefficients of \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \), respectively. Substituting:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2 \cdot 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \langle O \rangle \)
The expectation value of \( O = 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is:
\[
\langle O \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\langle O \rangle = 10(-0.5) + 5(0.866) = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67
\]

### Step 4: Round to One Decimal Place
The value \( -0.67 \) rounds to \( -0.7 \) when rounded to one decimal place.

### Final Answer
The expectation value of \( O \) is \( -0.7 \), which corresponds to option **C**.

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. The states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σ_z. I need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σ_z + 5σ_x up to one decimal place.

Hmm, expectation values. Right, I remember that the expectation value of an operator is the average value you'd expect to measure. For a given state, you calculate it by taking the conjugate transpose (bra) of the state, multiplying by the operator, and then multiplying by the state (ket). So it's ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, where O is the operator.

The operator here is 10σ_z +5σ_x. So I think I'll need to compute the expectation value of each part separately and then add them together.

Wait, but σ_z and σ_x are Pauli matrices. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices. So I should figure out what σ_z and σ_x are.

From what I remember, σ_z is [[1, 0], [0, -1]], and σ_x is [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. Let me write them down:

σ_z = [[1, 0],
        [0, -1]]

σ_x = [[0, 1],
        [1, 0]]

So the operator O becomes O = 10 σ_z +5 σ_x. Let me compute that. So O would be:

10*[[1, 0], [0, -1]] + 5*[[0, 1], [1, 0]]
= [[10*1 +5*0, 10*0 +5*1],
   [10*0 +5*1, 10*(-1) +5*0]]
Which simplifies to:
[[10, 5],
 [5, -10]]

So O is a 2x2 matrix with elements [10,5;5,-10].

But wait, maybe I don't need the matrix directly. Because the expectation value is ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩. Alternatively, since O is 10σ_z +5σ_x, I can compute the expectation value of each part separately and sum them.

Because expectation values are linear, so ⟨A + B⟩ = ⟨A⟩ + ⟨B⟩, right? So maybe it's easier to compute ⟨σ_z⟩ and ⟨σ_x⟩ separately and then combine them.

So let's do that. First, let me find ⟨σ_z⟩.

The state ψ is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let me write this in vector form. Since |↑⟩ is the eigenstate of σ_z with eigenvalue +1, and |↓⟩ is the eigenstate with eigenvalue -1.

Wait, so |↑⟩ is [1; 0], and |↓⟩ is [0; 1]. So ψ is a vector [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

Because ψ = 0.5 [1;0] + (sqrt(3)/2) [0;1] = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

So to compute ⟨σ_z⟩, which is the expectation value for σ_z. But since σ_z has eigenvalues 1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, the expectation value is just the probability of measuring +1 times 1 plus the probability of measuring -1 times (-1).

Wait, but the state is given as a superposition. So the probabilities are the squares of the amplitudes.

Looking at ψ, the coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. So the probability of |↑⟩ is (0.5)^2 = 0.25, and of |↓⟩ is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4 = 0.75.

So ⟨σ_z⟩ = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

Wait that's cool. So that's the expectation value for σ_z.

Now, for σ_x. The expectation value ⟨σ_x⟩ is a bit trickier. Because |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σ_z, not σ_x. So we can't directly compute it like we did for σ_z.

I think I need to compute it using the matrix representation. So first, let me write ψ as a column vector: [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

Then, the expectation value of σ_x would be ψ† σ_x ψ. Let's compute that.

Alternatively, σ_x is the Pauli X matrix, which swaps the basis states. So ψ in the σ_z basis is [a, b]^T. Then, σ_x ψ would be [b, a]^T. So, let me compute ψ† σ_x ψ.

Wait, let me compute it step by step. ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

Compute ψ† σ_x ψ: take the conjugate transpose of ψ (which, since the coefficients are real, is just the transpose) multiplied by σ_x, then multiplied by ψ.

So, ψ† σ_x = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] multiplied by σ_x.

Wait, σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So ψ† σ_x would be [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] multiplied by that matrix.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, matrix multiplication is associative. So ψ† is a 1x2 matrix. σ_x is 2x2. So ψ† σ_x is 1x2.

Let me compute that:

ψ† σ_x = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [[0,1],[1,0]]

So, each element is sum of products. Let's compute each element:

First element (row 1, column 1): 0.5*0 + sqrt(3)/2 *1 = sqrt(3)/2.

Second element (row 1, column 2): 0.5*1 + sqrt(3)/2 *0 = 0.5.

So ψ† σ_x is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5].

Then, multiply this by ψ, which is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

So, (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 + (0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) = 0.5 (sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3)/2) = 0.5 * sqrt(3) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, that's the calculation for ⟨σ_x⟩. So approximately 0.866.

But wait, let me check that calculation again. Because sometimes I get mixed up with how the matrices multiply.

Another way: The expectation value of σ_x is (a*b' + a'*b), where a is the amplitude of |↑⟩ and b is the amplitude of |↓⟩. Because σ_x is the swap operator, so in the σ_z basis, its expectation is 2 Re(a b*), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, for any state ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, the expectation value of σ_x is (a b* + a* b). Since a and b are real in this case, it's 2ab.

Wait yes, because |↑⟩ is [1;0], |↓⟩ is [0;1]. So ψ is [a; b], with a=0.5, b= sqrt(3)/2.

So σ_x is the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. So ψ† σ_x ψ is a^2 *0 + a*b*1 + b*a*1 + b^2 *0. Wait, no, that's the matrix multiplication. Let me compute it as (a [1 0] + b [0 1]) σ_x (a [1;0] + b[0;1]).

Alternatively, the expectation value is (a b + a b) because when you multiply, the cross terms are a*b and b*a, so 2 a b.

Wait, when you compute ψ† σ_x ψ, it's a times b plus b times a, because the cross terms. So that's 2ab.

In our case, a is 0.5, b is sqrt(3)/2. So 2 * 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) = 2*(0.5)*(0.866...) = 0.866..., which is approximately 0.866. So that's correct.

So ⟨σ_x⟩ is 2ab = 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) ) = (sqrt(3)/2) ≈ 0.866.

So putting it all together, the expectation value of the operator O=10σ_z +5σ_x is:

⟨O⟩ = 10⟨σ_z⟩ +5⟨σ_x⟩.

We have ⟨σ_z⟩= -0.5, ⟨σ_x⟩≈0.866.

So 10*(-0.5) is -5. And 5*(0.866) is 4.33.

Adding those together: -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.

Wait, wait, that's negative 0.67. But let's do the exact calculation to avoid rounding errors.

Wait, sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732.

So 2ab = 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) = (sqrt(3)/2). So sqrt(3) is about 1.732, so 1.732/2 is 0.866.

So 5*(0.866)=4.33.

But wait, maybe I should be more precise with the exact value.

Wait, let's compute it exactly. Let me re-calculate ⟨σ_x⟩.

ψ is 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)| ↓⟩.

So when you compute ψ† σ_x ψ, which is (0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*(0.5) = 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) = (sqrt(3)/2). So sqrt(3) is about 1.73205, so sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.8660254.

So 5 multiplied by that is 5 * 0.8660254 ≈4.330127.

Now, 10*(⟨σ_z⟩)=10*(-0.5)= -5.

Adding them: -5 +4.330127 = -0.669873.

Which is approximately -0.67.

Wait, but the problem says to provide the expectation value up to one decimal place. So -0.67 rounds to -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place. Because 0.67 is closer to 0.7 than 0.6 when rounded to one decimal.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 0.67 is 0.7 when rounded to one decimal place. Because the second decimal is 7, which is 5 or more, so we round up. So -0.67 becomes approximately -0.7.

But let me double-check the exact calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of ⟨σ_x⟩. Let me recompute.

Alternatively, perhaps I should directly compute ψ† (10σ_z +5σ_x) ψ.

Alternatively, ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

So the operator O is 10σ_z +5σ_x, which as a matrix is:

10*[[1, 0], [0, -1]] +5*[[0,1],[1,0]] = [[10,5],[5,-10]].

So now, the expectation value is ψ† O ψ.

Compute that as:

[0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [[10,5],[5,-10]] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

First, compute the matrix multiplication of O and ψ.

The matrix O is:

Row 1: 10,5.

Row 2:5, -10.

So O * ψ is:

First element: 10*0.5 +5*(sqrt(3)/2) =5 + (5 sqrt(3))/2 ≈5 + (8.660)/2=5+4.330=9.330.

Wait, but wait, it's O multiplied by ψ, which is a column vector. So let me compute each component:

Top element: 10*(0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2) =5 + (5 sqrt(3))/2.

Bottom element:5*(0.5) + (-10)*(sqrt(3)/2) =2.5 -5 sqrt(3).

So the result of Oψ is:

[5 + (5 sqrt(3))/2,

 2.5 -5 sqrt(3) ].

Then, ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

So the expectation value is ψ† (Oψ) = 0.5*(5 + (5 sqrt(3))/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*(2.5 -5 sqrt(3)).

Let me compute each term.

First term: 0.5*(5) =2.5.

0.5*(5 sqrt(3)/2 )= (5 sqrt(3))/4 ≈ (8.660)/4≈2.165.

Second term: sqrt(3)/2 *2.5 = (2.5 sqrt(3))/2 ≈ (4.330)/2=2.165.

Third term: sqrt(3)/2 * (-5 sqrt(3)) = (-5*3)/2 = (-15)/2 = -7.5.

So adding all terms:

2.5 + 2.165 + 2.165 -7.5.

Let me compute:

2.5 +2.165 =4.665.

4.665 +2.165=6.83.

6.83 -7.5= -0.67.

So again, I get -0.67. So rounded to one decimal place, that's -0.7.

Looking at the options, option C is -0.7.

Wait, but I thought the options were:

A) -1.4

B) 1.65

C) -0.7

D) 0.85

So the correct answer would be C) -0.7.

Wait, but earlier I thought 10σ_z gives -5 and 5σ_x gives +4.33, so their sum is -0.67, which rounds to -0.7. That's correct.

So the answer is C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( O = 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given spin-half particle state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are eigenstates of \( \sigma_z \). The expectation value is computed as \( \langle O \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle \).

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
The eigenvalues of \( \sigma_z \) are \( +1 \) for \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( -1 \) for \( |\downarrow\rangle \). The probabilities of measuring \( +1 \) and \( -1 \) are the squares of the coefficients of \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \), respectively:
- Probability of \( +1 \): \( |0.5|^2 = 0.25 \)
- Probability of \( -1 \): \( \left|\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right|^2 = 0.75 \)

Thus,  
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is given by:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2ab
\]
where \( a = 0.5 \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \) are the coefficients of \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \), respectively. Substituting:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2 \cdot 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \langle O \rangle \)
The expectation value of \( O = 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is:
\[
\langle O \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\langle O \rangle = 10(-0.5) + 5(0.866) = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67
\]

### Step 4: Round to One Decimal Place
The value \( -0.67 \) rounds to \( -0.7 \) when rounded to one decimal place.

### Final Answer
The expectation value of \( O \) is \( -0.7 \), which corresponds to option **C**.
