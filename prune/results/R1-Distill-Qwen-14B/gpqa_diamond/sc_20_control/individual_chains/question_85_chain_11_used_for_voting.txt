Okay, so I've got this question here about two planets orbiting a star, and I'm supposed to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's try to unpack this step by step.

First, I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on a few factors, right? The main ones are the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Oh wait, the question says both planets have the same albedo, so that might simplify things a bit because I don't have to worry about that factor changing between the two.

The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - A) / ( (1 + e cos θ )) ), but wait, since the orbits are circular, the eccentricity e is zero. So the formula simplifies to T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)), where a is the planet's orbital distance from the star.

But wait, another thought: The star's effective temperature is given, so maybe I should start by finding the star's luminosity. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law comes into play here. Luminosity L = 4πR²σTeff⁴. So I can compute the star's luminosity using that.

Wait, but since I'm looking for the ratio of the planets' temperatures, maybe I don't have to compute the actual values, just express them in terms of their semi-major axes. Because when I take the ratio, some terms might cancel out.

Let me think: For each planet, the equilibrium temperature is proportional to the star's temperature multiplied by the square root of (R_star / a). Because the formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1-A)^(1/4) ), but since A is the same for both, that's a constant and cancels out when taking the ratio.

So the ratio T1/T2 would be sqrt( (R_star/(a1)) / (R_star/(a2)) ) = sqrt(a2/a1). Because when I take T1 over T2, the R_star and T_star terms would cancel, leaving sqrt(a2/a1).

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. The formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( (R_star/(2a)) ), so for planet 1, T1 = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a1) ), planet 2, T2 = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a2) ). So T1/T2 = sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2/a1 ). Oh, right, because the 2 and R_star terms are same for both, so they cancel.

So the ratio T1/T2 is sqrt( a2 / a1 ). So I need to find a1 and a2, the orbital distances of the two planets.

Wait, how do I find a1 and a2? The question gives data about the RV shifts of the star's spectral lines due to each planet. So each planet causes a Doppler shift, which relates to their mass and orbital period. But wait, the RV method measures the star's velocity towards and away from us due to the planet's gravitational pull.

The RV shift gives the semi-amplitude K of the star's orbit around the barycenter. The semi-amplitude K is given by the formula K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) ) ) * ( (1) ) / ( (a_planet) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) )

But since the planets have masses much smaller than the star, M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star, and e is zero (circular orbits), the formula simplifies. Also, the K formula for a planet is given as:

K = ( (27.4 m/s) ) * ( (M_planet sin i) / (M_jup) ) ) * ( (P_days)^(-1/3) ) / ( (M_star / M_sun + M_planet / M_jup )^(2/3) ) )

Wait, maybe a better approach is to use the radial velocity semi-amplitude formula:

K = (v) = ( (G P )/( 2π c ) )^(1/3) * ( M_planet sin i ) / ( ( M_star + M_planet )^{2/3} (1 - e²)^0.5 ) )

But since e is zero and sin i is 1 (assuming edge-on orbit, which is typical for transiting planets), this simplifies to:

K = ( (G P )/( 2π c ) )^(1/3) * ( M_planet ) / ( M_star^{2/3} )

Wait, but I think I might be getting mixed up here. Maybe I should think about the relation between the RV semi-amplitude and the planet's mass and orbital period.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio of their semi-major axes using the RV shifts provided. Because the RV shift is given for each planet, and I can relate that to each planet's semi-major axis.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( ( (G * M_planet ) / ( (M_star + M_planet) ) )^(1/3) ) * (2π / P )^(1/3) ) / (c) )

Wait, maybe I should re-derive it. The RV method gives K as:

K = [ (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) ] * [ (M_planet sin i) / (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) ]

But since M_planet << M_star, this simplifies to:

K ≈ [ (2π G ) / ( c P ) )^(1/3) ] * ( M_planet ) / ( M_star^(2/3) )

But I don't have the orbital periods P. So perhaps I can find the ratio of the semi-major axes using the RV shifts and the masses.

Wait another approach: The star's velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the planet's orbital velocity. Because the star and planet orbit their common center of mass, so the ratio of their velocities is inversely proportional to their masses. So, K = (M_planet/(M_star + M_planet)) * v_planet. But since M_planet is much less than M_star, K ≈ (M_planet / M_star) * v_planet.

But v_planet is the planet's orbital speed, which is given by v = sqrt( G M_star / a ), where a is the semi-major axis. So,

K ≈ (M_planet / M_star) * sqrt( G M_star / a )

Simplify: K ≈ (M_planet) * sqrt( G / (a M_star) )

But wait, let's get the exact expression. Let me try again.

For a circular orbit, the star's velocity is K = (v_planet * M_planet) / (M_star + M_planet) ) 

Since M_planet << M_star, K ≈ (v_planet * M_planet) / M_star.

And v_planet is the orbital speed of the planet, which is sqrt(G M_star / a).

So, K ≈ ( M_planet / M_star ) * sqrt( G M_star / a )

Which simplifies to K ≈ ( M_planet ) * sqrt( G / (a M_star ) )

Wait, but let me square both sides to make it easier.

K^2 ≈ ( M_planet^2 * G ) / ( a M_star )

So, a = ( G M_planet^2 ) / ( K^2 M_star )

Wait, wait, let me re-arrange that equation. Rearranging the equation:

K = ( M_planet / M_star ) * sqrt( G M_star / a )

Let me square both sides:

K² = ( M_planet² / M_star² ) * ( G M_star / a )

Which simplifies to:

K² = ( M_planet² G ) / ( M_star a )

Then, solving for a:

a = ( M_planet² G ) / ( M_star K² )

Wait, that can't be right because the units wouldn't match. Wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra.

Wait, more accurately, from K ≈ ( M_planet / M_star ) * sqrt( G M_star / a )

So, K = ( M_planet / M_star ) * sqrt( G M_star / a )

Square both sides:

K² = ( M_planet² / M_star² ) * ( G M_star / a )

= ( M_planet² G M_star ) / ( M_star² a )

= ( M_planet² G ) / ( M_star a )

So, a = ( M_planet² G ) / ( M_star K² )

Wait, but the units: G is in m^3 kg^-1 s^-2. M_planet is in kg, M_star in kg, K in m/s. Let's check:

[ a ] = [ M_planet² (m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) ) ] / [ kg * (m/s)^2 ) ]

Wait, (m/s)^2 is m²/s².

So denominator: kg * m²/s².

Numerator: kg^2 * m^3 / kg^2 s^2? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try again. Actually, maybe I should just proceed with the formula as it is, because maybe the units will cancel correctly.

So, the formula for a is:

a = ( G * M_planet^2 ) / ( M_star * K^2 )

Wait, but in this case, the question gives the RV shifts in terms of Ångströms. So how does that relate to the velocity K?

Wait, the RV shift is given as a Doppler shift in wavelength. The Doppler shift formula is (Δλ / λ) = v / c, where v is the velocity along the line of sight, and c is the speed of light.

So, the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the observed Doppler shift. The question states that Planet1 induces a shift of 0.03 Å in the [OI] line at 6300 Å, while Planet2's shift is 0.04 Å in the same line.

So, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = c * (Δλ / λ )

So, for Planet1, K1 = c * (0.03 / 6300) m/s.

Similarly, K2 = c * (0.04 /6300) m/s.

But wait, the star's velocity is K, so that's the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit.

So, for each planet, their respective K is given by their respective Δλ.

Let me compute K1 and K2.

But wait, I think I can work with their ratio, so perhaps I don't need to compute the actual values, just the ratio of a1 to a2.

So, from the formula a = ( G M_planet^2 ) / ( M_star K^2 )

So, a1 / a2 = [ ( M1^2 ) / ( K1^2 ) ] / [ ( M2^2 ) / ( K2^2 ) ) ]

Because the G and M_star terms cancel out when taking the ratio.

So,

a1/a2 = ( M1² / K1² ) * ( K2² / M2² )

= ( (M1/M2) )^2 * ( (K2/K1) )^2

= [ (M1/M2) * (K2/K1) ) ]^2

So,

a1/a2 = [ (7 M_earth / 5 M_earth) * ( (0.04 Å) / (0.03 Å) ) ) ]^2

Simplify:

= [ (7/5) * (4/3) ) ]^2

Because 0.04/0.03 = 4/3.

So,

(7/5) * (4/3) = 28/15 ≈ 1.8667

So,

a1/a2 = (28/15)^2 ≈ (784/225) ≈ 3.4844

Wait, but this can't be right. Because if a1 is larger than a2, then planet1 is farther out, so its equilibrium temperature would be lower. But the ratio of temperatures is T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ), which would be sqrt(1/3.4844) ≈ 0.53.

Wait, but let me make sure I did the ratio correctly.

Wait, a1 is the semi-major axis of Planet1, which has a larger RV shift? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the star's velocity towards us. So, the larger the K, the more the star is moving. But according to the formula, a larger K implies a smaller a, because from the equation a = (G M_p^2) / (M_s K^2), so higher K leads to smaller a.

Wait, so let's correct the approach.

Wait, the RV shift is given by Δλ, so K is proportional to (Δλ / λ) * c.

So, for Planet1, K1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c.

For Planet2, K2 = (0.04 / 6300) * c.

So, K2 is larger than K1. Which implies that Planet2 has a larger RV semi-amplitude. So, from the formula a = (G M_p^2) / ( M_s K^2 ), a larger K implies a smaller a. So, Planet2 has a smaller a because K2 > K1.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. If a planet has a larger K, that means the star is moving more in response to the planet's gravity. So, for a more massive planet or a planet closer to the star, the star's velocity would be higher. Because a planet closer in would cause a higher velocity in the star.

Wait, yes, because for a given mass, a planet closer to the star (smaller a) would have a higher velocity (since velocity is higher in tighter orbits), and thus a higher RV semi-amplitude K.

So, if Planet2 has a larger K (0.04 vs 0.03), it's either more massive or closer, or both. But wait, in our case, Planet1 has a higher mass (7 M_e vs 5 M_e). But K is larger for Planet2. So, perhaps Planet2 is closer, making up for the lower mass by being closer.

So, back to the ratio a1/a2. From earlier, I found a1/a2 = [ (7/5) * (4/3) ) ]^2 = (28/15)^2 ≈ 3.4844.

So, a1 is about 3.48 times a2. That would mean Planet1 is farther than Planet2, which makes sense since Planet2 has a higher K, meaning it's closer.

Now, the equilibrium temperature ratio is T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) = sqrt(1/3.4844) ≈ 1/sqrt(3.4844) ≈ 1/1.8667 ≈ 0.534.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.53, which would be the ratio T1/T2.

Wait, but option C is 0.53, which is what I get. So the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is T1:T2 ≈ 0.53, so the answer should be option C.

To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we use the formula for equilibrium temperature:

\[
T_{\text{eq}} = T_{\text{star}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{2a}}
\]

Here, \(T_{\text{star}}\) is the star's effective temperature, \(R_{\text{star}}\) is the star's radius, and \(a\) is the planet's orbital distance. Since both planets have the same albedo and the star's properties are identical for both, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures simplifies to:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Thus, the key is to determine the ratio of the semi-major axes \(a_1\) and \(a_2\).

### Step 1: Relating Radial Velocity (RV) Shifts to Semi-Major Axes
The RV semi-amplitude \(K\) is related to the orbital distance \(a\) by the formula:

\[
a = \frac{G M_{\text{planet}}^2}{M_{\text{star}} K^2}
\]

For the ratio \(a_1 / a_2\), the terms \(G\) and \(M_{\text{star}}\) cancel out, leaving:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{M_1}{M_2}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{K_2}{K_1}\right)^2
\]

Substituting the given values:
- \(M_1 = 7 M_{\text{Earth}}, M_2 = 5 M_{\text{Earth}}\)
- \(K_1 = 0.03 \, \text{Å}, K_2 = 0.04 \, \text{Å}\)

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{7}{5}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{0.04}{0.03}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{7}{5}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{4}{3}\right)^2
\]

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{28}{15}\right)^2 = \frac{784}{225} \approx 3.484
\]

Thus, \(a_1 \approx 3.484 \cdot a_2\), meaning Planet1 is farther from the star than Planet2.

### Step 2: Calculating the Temperature Ratio
The equilibrium temperature ratio is:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Substituting \(a_1 / a_2 \approx 3.484\):

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{3.484}} \approx \sqrt{0.287} \approx 0.534
\]

### Final Answer
The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately **0.53**, which corresponds to option C.

Okay, so I've got this question here about two planets orbiting a star, and I'm supposed to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's try to unpack this step by step.

First, I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on a few factors, right? The main ones are the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Oh wait, the question says both planets have the same albedo, so that might simplify things a bit because I don't have to worry about that factor changing between the two.

But wait, another thought: The star's effective temperature is given, so maybe I should start by finding the star's luminosity. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law comes into play here. Luminosity L = 4πR²σTeff⁴. So I can compute the star's luminosity using that.

Let me think: For each planet, the equilibrium temperature is proportional to the star's temperature multiplied by the square root of (R_star / a). Because the formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1-A)^(1/4) ), but since A is the same for both, that's a constant and cancels out when taking the ratio.

So the ratio T1/T2 would be sqrt( (R_star/(a1)) / (R_star/(a2)) ) = sqrt(a2/a1). Because when I take T1 over T2, the R_star and T_star terms would cancel, leaving sqrt(a2/a1).

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. The formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( (R_star/(2a)) ), so for planet 1, T1 = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a1) ), planet 2, T2 = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a2) ). So T1/T2 = sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2/a1 ). Oh, right, because the 2 and R_star terms are same for both, so they cancel.

So the ratio T1/T2 is sqrt( a2 / a1 ). So I need to find a1 and a2, the orbital distances of the two planets.

Wait, how do I find a1 and a2? The question gives data about the RV shifts of the star's spectral lines due to each planet. So each planet causes a Doppler shift, which relates to their mass and orbital period. But wait, the RV method measures the star's velocity towards and away from us due to the planet's gravitational pull.

The RV shift gives the semi-amplitude K of the star's orbit around the barycenter. The semi-amplitude K is given by the formula K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) ) ) * ( (1) ) / ( (a_planet) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) )

But since the planets have masses much smaller than the star, M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star, and e is zero (circular orbits), the formula simplifies. Also, the K formula for a planet is given as:

K = ( (27.4 m/s) ) * ( (M_planet sin i) / (M_jup) ) ) * ( (P_days)^(-1/3) ) / ( (M_star / M_sun + M_planet / M_jup )^(2/3) ) )

Wait, maybe a better approach is to use the radial velocity semi-amplitude formula:

K = (v) = ( (G P )/( 2π c ) )^(1/3) * ( M_planet sin i ) / ( ( M_star + M_planet )^{2/3} (1 - e²)^0.5 ) )

But since e is zero and sin i is 1 (assuming edge-on orbit, which is typical for transiting planets), this simplifies to:

K = ( (G P )/( 2π c ) )^(1/3) * ( M_planet ) / ( M_star^{2/3} )

Wait, but I think I might be getting mixed up here. Maybe I should think about the relation between the RV semi-amplitude and the planet's mass and orbital period.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio of their semi-major axes using the RV shifts provided. Because the RV shift is given for each planet, and I can relate that to each planet's semi-major axis.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( ( (G * M_planet ) / ( (M_star + M_planet) ) )^(1/3) ) * (2π / P )^(1/3) ) / (c) )

Wait, maybe I should re-derive it. The RV method gives K as:

K = [ (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) ] * [ (M_planet sin i) / (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) ]

But since M_planet << M_star, this simplifies to:

K ≈ [ (2π G ) / ( c P ) )^(1/3) ] * ( M_planet ) / ( M_star^(2/3) )

But I don't have the orbital periods P. So perhaps I can find the ratio of the semi-major axes using the RV shifts and the masses.

Wait another approach: The star's velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the planet's orbital velocity. Because the star and planet orbit their common center of mass, so the ratio of their velocities is inversely proportional to their masses. So, K = (M_planet/(M_star + M_planet)) * v_planet. But since M_planet is much less than M_star, K ≈ (M_planet / M_star) * v_planet.

But v_planet is the planet's orbital speed, which is given by v = sqrt( G M_star / a ), where a is the semi-major axis. So,

K ≈ (M_planet / M_star) * sqrt( G M_star / a )

Simplify: K ≈ (M_planet) * sqrt( G / (a M_star) )

But wait, let's get the exact expression. Let me try again.

For a circular orbit, the star's velocity is K = (v_planet * M_planet) / (M_star + M_planet) ) 

Since M_planet << M_star, K ≈ (v_planet * M_planet) / M_star.

And v_planet is the orbital speed of the planet, which is sqrt(G M_star / a).

So, K ≈ ( M_planet / M_star ) * sqrt( G M_star / a )

Which simplifies to K ≈ ( M_planet ) * sqrt( G / (a M_star ) )

Wait, but let me square both sides to make it easier.

K^2 ≈ ( M_planet^2 * G ) / ( a M_star )

So, a = ( G M_planet^2 ) / ( K^2 M_star )

Wait, wait, let me re-arrange that equation. Rearranging the equation:

K = ( M_planet / M_star ) * sqrt( G M_star / a )

Let me square both sides:

K² = ( M_planet² / M_star² ) * ( G M_star / a )

Which simplifies to:

K² = ( M_planet² G ) / ( M_star a )

Then, solving for a:

a = ( M_planet² G ) / ( M_star K² )

Wait, that can't be right because the units wouldn't match. Wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra.

Wait, more accurately, from K ≈ ( M_planet / M_star ) * sqrt( G M_star / a )

So, K = ( M_planet / M_star ) * sqrt( G M_star / a )

Square both sides:

K² = ( M_planet² / M_star² ) * ( G M_star / a )

= ( M_planet² G M_star ) / ( M_star² a )

= ( M_planet² G ) / ( M_star a )

So, a = ( M_planet² G ) / ( M_star K² )

Wait, but the units: G is in m^3 kg^-1 s^-2. M_planet is in kg, M_star in kg, K in m/s. Let's check:

[ a ] = [ M_planet² (m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) ) ] / [ kg * (m/s)^2 ) ]

Wait, (m/s)^2 is m²/s².

So denominator: kg * m²/s².

Numerator: kg^2 * m^3 / kg^2 s^2? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try again. Actually, maybe I should just proceed with the formula as it is, because maybe the units will cancel correctly.

So, the formula for a is:

a = ( G * M_planet^2 ) / ( M_star * K^2 )

Wait, but in this case, the question gives the RV shifts in terms of Ångströms. So how does that relate to the velocity K?

Wait, the RV shift is given as a Doppler shift in wavelength. The Doppler shift formula is (Δλ / λ) = v / c, where v is the velocity along the line of sight, and c is the speed of light.

So, the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the observed Doppler shift. The question states that Planet1 induces a shift of 0.03 Å in the [OI] line at 6300 Å, while Planet2's shift is 0.04 Å in the same line.

So, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = c * (Δλ / λ )

So, for Planet1, K1 = c * (0.03 / 6300) m/s.

Similarly, K2 = c * (0.04 /6300) m/s.

But wait, the star's velocity is K, so that's the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit.

So, for each planet, their respective K is given by their respective Δλ.

Let me compute K1 and K2.

But wait, I think I can work with their ratio, so perhaps I don't need to compute the actual values, just the ratio of a1 to a2.

So, from the formula a = ( G M_planet^2 ) / ( M_star K^2 )

So, a1 / a2 = [ ( M1^2 ) / ( K1^2 ) ] / [ ( M2^2 ) / ( K2^2 ) ) ]

Because the G and M_star terms cancel out when taking the ratio.

So,

a1/a2 = ( M1² / K1² ) * ( K2² / M2² )

= ( (M1/M2) )^2 * ( (K2/K1) )^2

= [ (M1/M2) * (K2/K1) ) ]^2

So,

a1/a2 = [ (7 M_earth / 5 M_earth) * ( (0.04 Å) / (0.03 Å) ) ) ]^2

Simplify:

= [ (7/5) * (4/3) ) ]^2

Because 0.04/0.03 = 4/3.

So,

(7/5) * (4/3) = 28/15 ≈ 1.8667

So,

a1/a2 = (28/15)^2 ≈ (784/225) ≈ 3.4844

Wait, but this can't be right. Because if a1 is larger than a2, then planet1 is farther out, so its equilibrium temperature would be lower. But the ratio of temperatures is T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ), which would be sqrt(1/3.4844) ≈ 0.53.

Wait, but let me make sure I did the ratio correctly.

Wait, a1 is the semi-major axis of Planet1, which has a larger RV shift? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the star's velocity towards us. So, the larger the K, the more the star is moving. But according to the formula, a larger K implies a smaller a, because from the equation a = (G M_p^2) / (M_s K^2), so higher K leads to smaller a.

Wait, so let's correct the approach.

Wait, the RV shift is given by Δλ, so K is proportional to (Δλ / λ) * c.

So, for Planet1, K1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c.

For Planet2, K2 = (0.04 / 6300) * c.

So, K2 is larger than K1. Which implies that Planet2 has a larger RV semi-amplitude. So, from the formula a = (G M_p^2) / ( M_s K^2 ), a larger K implies a smaller a. So, Planet2 has a smaller a because K2 > K1.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. If a planet has a larger K, that means the star is moving more in response to the planet's gravity. So, for a more massive planet or a planet closer to the star, the star's velocity would be higher. Because a planet closer in would cause a higher velocity in the star.

Wait, yes, because for a given mass, a planet closer to the star (smaller a) would have a higher velocity (since velocity is higher in tighter orbits), and thus a higher RV semi-amplitude K.

So, if Planet2 has a larger K (0.04 vs 0.03), it's either more massive or closer, or both. But wait, in our case, Planet1 has a higher mass (7 M_e vs 5 M_e). But K is larger for Planet2. So, perhaps Planet2 is closer, making up for the lower mass by being closer.

So, back to the ratio a1/a2. From earlier, I found a1/a2 = [ (7/5) * (4/3) ) ]^2 = (28/15)^2 ≈ 3.4844.

So, a1 is about 3.48 times a2. That would mean Planet1 is farther than Planet2, which makes sense since Planet2 has a higher K, meaning it's closer.

Now, the equilibrium temperature ratio is T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) = sqrt(1/3.4844) ≈ 1/sqrt(3.4844) ≈ 1/1.8667 ≈ 0.534.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.53, which would be the ratio T1/T2.

Wait, but option C is 0.53, which is what I get. So the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is T1:T2 ≈ 0.53, so the answer should be option C.


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we use the formula for equilibrium temperature:

\[
T_{\text{eq}} = T_{\text{star}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{2a}}
\]

Here, \(T_{\text{star}}\) is the star's effective temperature, \(R_{\text{star}}\) is the star's radius, and \(a\) is the planet's orbital distance. Since both planets have the same albedo and the star's properties are identical for both, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures simplifies to:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Thus, the key is to determine the ratio of the semi-major axes \(a_1\) and \(a_2\).

### Step 1: Relating Radial Velocity (RV) Shifts to Semi-Major Axes
The RV semi-amplitude \(K\) is related to the orbital distance \(a\) by the formula:

\[
a = \frac{G M_{\text{planet}}^2}{M_{\text{star}} K^2}
\]

For the ratio \(a_1 / a_2\), the terms \(G\) and \(M_{\text{star}}\) cancel out, leaving:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{M_1}{M_2}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{K_2}{K_1}\right)^2
\]

Substituting the given values:
- \(M_1 = 7 M_{\text{Earth}}, M_2 = 5 M_{\text{Earth}}\)
- \(K_1 = 0.03 \, \text{Å}, K_2 = 0.04 \, \text{Å}\)

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{7}{5}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{0.04}{0.03}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{7}{5}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{4}{3}\right)^2
\]

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{28}{15}\right)^2 = \frac{784}{225} \approx 3.484
\]

Thus, \(a_1 \approx 3.484 \cdot a_2\), meaning Planet1 is farther from the star than Planet2.

### Step 2: Calculating the Temperature Ratio
The equilibrium temperature ratio is:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Substituting \(a_1 / a_2 \approx 3.484\):

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{3.484}} \approx \sqrt{0.287} \approx 0.534
\]

### Final Answer
The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately **0.53**, which corresponds to option C.
