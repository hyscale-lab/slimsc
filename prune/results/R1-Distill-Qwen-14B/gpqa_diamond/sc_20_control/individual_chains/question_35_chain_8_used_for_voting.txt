Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I remember that angular momentum operators are related to spin matrices. Let me try to break this down.

The question says that Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix and it's given as Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is another 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second as (i, 0). Oh right, I think S here is the spin matrix for the Y-component. 

Wait, spin matrices for angular momentum components. For spin-1/2 particles, like electrons or muons, the Pauli matrices are involved. Oh wait, the Pauli matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. The Y component matrix is sigma_y multiplied by ħ/2, but maybe. Let me think: The standard spin matrices for a spin-1/2 particle have S_x = (ħ/2)σ_x, S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y, and S_z = (ħ/2)σ_z. 

But in this problem, the matrix S given is:
S = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0] ]
Wait, what's the standard sigma_y matrix? Sigma_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], yes. So S here is sigma_y, and since Ay is c times S, then Ay = c * sigma_y.

So c is h/(4π). Let me compute that. h is Planck's constant, but in some contexts it's written as ħ. Wait, ħ is h/(2π). So c is h/(4π) = (ħ/2). Because h = 2πħ, so h/(4π) is (2πħ)/(4π) = ħ/2. So c is ħ/2. So Ay = (ħ/2) * sigma_y. 

Wait, but wait a second. The standard expression for S_y is (ħ/2) sigma_y. So here, Ay is exactly S_y. So Ay equals the spin angular momentum operator in the y-direction. 

But wait, the problem says that the matrix operator Ay is c multiplied by S, and S is the given matrix. So yes, then Ay is (ħ/2) sigma_y, which matches the standard S_y. 

So the question is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Since Ay is a spin-1/2 operator, its eigenvalues should be ± ħ/2. Because for any spin-1/2 particle, the eigenvalues of the spin component are ± ħ/2. 

Wait, but let me make sure. The general eigenvalue equation for a Pauli matrix is something like (sigma · n) |psi> = ±1 |psi>, scaled by ħ/2. So yes, the eigenvalues of Ay should be ± ħ/2. 

Wait, but let's compute the eigenvalues. The matrix Ay is (ħ/2) * sigma_y. The eigenvalues of sigma_y are ±1. So when multiplied by (ħ/2), the eigenvalues become (ħ/2) * (±1) → ± ħ/2. So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. 

Looking at the options, option A says the imaginary part of the eigenvalue is ±2πh or ± something. That doesn't make sense because the eigenvalues are real, right? Because the spin matrices for components have real eigenvalues. So option A is talking about imaginary parts, which can't be right. 

Option B: Imaginary parts are ±1/2. Wait, no, the eigenvalues are real. So the eigenvalues are real numbers, so their imaginary parts are zero. So option B is incorrect because it's talking about the eigenvalues having imaginary parts. 

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of the Z-component Az. Hmm, A² would be the square of the angular momentum operator. Since the spin is 1/2, A² should be ( (ħ/2)^2 ) I, where I is the identity matrix. So any eigenfunction of Ay will also be an eigenfunction of A² because A² is a multiple of the identity matrix. So the statement in C says they can be eigenfunctions of A², which is correct. But what about Az? 

Wait, the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenvectors of S_y, which are not the same as the eigenvectors of S_z. So if a state is an eigenstate of Ay, it won't be an eigenstate of Az. So the statement in C is correct. Because eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. So option C is correct. 

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, not sure. The basis functions of the operator would be its eigenvectors. So the eigenfunctions φ form a basis for the space, which is 2-dimensional here. So yes, they can form a basis. But the statement says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. I'm not exactly sure what that means, but perhaps it's correct. 

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps I should look back at the options.

Wait, the question is, during the calculation, which statement is correct. So which of these statements is correct when you compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

So, let's re-examine the options.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. The basis functions are the eigenvectors, so yes, they form a basis. But the operator's matrix is in that basis? Well, the matrix representation is in the standard basis, but the eigenfunctions form a different basis. So I'm not sure if option D is correct. It's possible but I'm not certain. 

But let's go back to the options.

So from the earlier analysis, the eigenvalues of Ay are ± ħ/2, which are real numbers. So options A and B are incorrect because they suggest the eigenvalues have imaginary parts. So the correct options are C or D.

Option C says that the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. Since A² is the square of the angular momentum, which for spin-1/2 is (ħ/2)^2 I, so all vectors are eigenstates. So any eigenstate of Ay will also be an eigenstate of A². That makes sense, so C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator Ay. I'm not exactly sure what that means. The basis functions of the operator's matrix? The operator's matrix is already expressed in some basis (like the standard basis), but the eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis in the Hilbert space. So the eigenfunctions can be a basis, but I'm not sure if that's the correct statement. 

Alternatively, perhaps option D is correct because the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) do form a basis for the space, which is 2-dimensional. So the statement could be correct. 

Wait, the question is about during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. So, when you calculate them, the eigenvectors form a basis for the space. So D is correct? Or is D saying that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator's matrix? Not sure. 

But based on the problem, the correct eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, which are real, so options A and B are out. So the correct answer is either C or D.

Looking back at option C: The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component Az. As A^2 is (ħ^2/4) I, any state is an eigenstate. So C is correct.

Option D's statement is a bit vague. The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. I think that's not necessarily correct because the basis functions are just the eigenvectors, which are used to diagonalize Ay, but the matrix representation of Ay is in the standard basis. So perhaps it's not correct. 

Thus, the correct statement is option C. But wait, let me think again. 

Another thought: the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) of Ay form a basis for the space, but are they a basis for the operator? I'm not sure. But the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. 

So, during the calculation, you find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis for the space, so if you express the operator in that basis, it's diagonal. So statement D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. 

Hmm, perhaps D is correct as well. But I'm getting a bit confused here. 

Wait, another angle: For any operator, the set of eigenvectors (if they are complete) form a basis for the space. So the statement in D is correct in that sense. Hence, D is correct. But which one of the options is correct?

Wait, but the question asks which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps the correct statement is C or D. 

Alternatively, perhaps the correct statement is D: the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. Because the eigenfunctions can serve as a basis, but the operator is represented in some basis, which may or may not be the eigenbasis.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So when calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, you are finding the basis in which the operator is diagonal. So the eigenvectors form a basis for the space, making D correct. 

But I'm not entirely sure. Now I'm torn between options C and D.

But looking back, the problem states that S is a 2x2 matrix, so we're dealing with a two-dimensional space. The eigenvectors of a 2x2 matrix (if it has two distinct eigenvalues) would form a basis. So the eigenfunctions are indeed a basis, so D is correct as a statement.

But wait, the options are:

A) Imaginary parts of eigenvalues are ±2πh or ±... No.

B) Same issue.

C) Eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az.

D) The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator.

So, which is correct?

I think C is correct because the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² (since A² is the same for any state), but not of Az since Ay and Az don't commute. So any eigenstate of Ay can't be an eigenstate of Az. So C is correct.

So the correct answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the correct statement about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), which is defined as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is a 2×2 matrix. The matrix \( S \) is given as:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & -i \\ 
i & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This matrix \( S \) corresponds to the Pauli matrix \( \sigma_y \), and \( A_y \) can thus be expressed as:

\[
A_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y.
\]

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**: This states that the imaginary part of the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm 2\pi h \) or \( \pm h/4\pi \), and the real parts are \( \pm h/4\pi \) or \( \pm 1 \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are real and given by \( \pm \hbar/2 \). The eigenvalues do not have imaginary parts, so this option is invalid.

2. **Option B**: This claims that the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 1/2 \) and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect because, as stated above, the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are real and equal to \( \pm \hbar/2 \). There is no imaginary component to the eigenvalues, so this option is invalid.

3. **Option C**: This states that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of the \( z \)-component \( A_z \). This is correct because \( A^2 \) is the square of the angular momentum operator, which for a spin-\( 1/2 \) particle is \( A^2 = \left(\frac{\hbar}{2}\right)^2 I \), where \( I \) is the identity matrix. Since \( A^2 \) is proportional to the identity matrix, all eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are also eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \). However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so an eigenfunction of \( A_y \) cannot be an eigenfunction of \( A_z \). Thus, this statement is correct.

4. **Option D**: This claims that the eigenfunctions \( \phi \) of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). While it is true that the eigenfunctions form a basis for the 2-dimensional Hilbert space, the phrasing of this statement is ambiguous. The eigenfunctions are not necessarily the "basis functions" of the operator \( A_y \) itself, as the operator is represented in a specific basis (e.g., the standard basis). Therefore, this statement is less precise and not as correct as Option C.

### Conclusion:

The correct statement is **Option C**, as it accurately describes the relationship between the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \).

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I remember that angular momentum operators are related to spin matrices. Let me try to break this down.

Wait, spin matrices for angular momentum components. For spin-1/2 particles, like electrons or muons, the Pauli matrices are involved. Oh wait, the Pauli matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. The Y component matrix is sigma_y multiplied by ħ/2, but maybe. Let me think: The standard spin matrices for a spin-1/2 particle have S_x = (ħ/2)σ_x, S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y, and S_z = (ħ/2)σ_z. 

But in this problem, the matrix S given is:
S = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0] ]
Wait, what's the standard sigma_y matrix? Sigma_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], yes. So S here is sigma_y, and since Ay is c times S, then Ay = c * sigma_y.

So c is h/(4π). Let me compute that. h is Planck's constant, but in some contexts it's written as ħ. Wait, ħ is h/(2π). So c is h/(4π) = (ħ/2). Because h = 2πħ, so h/(4π) is (2πħ)/(4π) = ħ/2. So c is ħ/2. So Ay = (ħ/2) * sigma_y. 

Wait, but wait a second. The standard expression for S_y is (ħ/2) sigma_y. So here, Ay is exactly S_y. So Ay equals the spin angular momentum operator in the y-direction. 

But wait, the problem says that the matrix operator Ay is c multiplied by S, and S is the given matrix. So yes, then Ay is (ħ/2) sigma_y, which matches the standard S_y. 

So the question is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Since Ay is a spin-1/2 operator, its eigenvalues should be ± ħ/2. Because for any spin-1/2 particle, the eigenvalues of the spin component are ± ħ/2. 

Wait, but let me make sure. The general eigenvalue equation for a Pauli matrix is something like (sigma · n) |psi> = ±1 |psi>, scaled by ħ/2. So yes, the eigenvalues of Ay should be ± ħ/2. 

Wait, but let's compute the eigenvalues. The matrix Ay is (ħ/2) * sigma_y. The eigenvalues of sigma_y are ±1. So when multiplied by (ħ/2), the eigenvalues become (ħ/2) * (±1) → ± ħ/2. So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. 

Looking at the options, option A says the imaginary part of the eigenvalue is ±2πh or ± something. That doesn't make sense because the eigenvalues are real, right? Because the spin matrices for components have real eigenvalues. So option A is talking about imaginary parts, which can't be right. 

Option B: Imaginary parts are ±1/2. Wait, no, the eigenvalues are real. So the eigenvalues are real numbers, so their imaginary parts are zero. So option B is incorrect because it's talking about the eigenvalues having imaginary parts. 

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of the Z-component Az. Hmm, A² would be the square of the angular momentum operator. Since the spin is 1/2, A² should be ( (ħ/2)^2 ) I, where I is the identity matrix. So any eigenfunction of Ay will also be an eigenfunction of A² because A² is a multiple of the identity matrix. So the statement in C says they can be eigenfunctions of A², which is correct. But what about Az? 

Wait, the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenvectors of S_y, which are not the same as the eigenvectors of S_z. So if a state is an eigenstate of Ay, it won't be an eigenstate of Az. So the statement in C is correct. Because eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. So option C is correct. 

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, not sure. The basis functions of the operator would be its eigenvectors. So the eigenfunctions φ form a basis for the space, which is 2-dimensional here. So yes, they can form a basis. But the statement says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. I'm not exactly sure what that means, but perhaps it's correct. 

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps I should look back at the options.
