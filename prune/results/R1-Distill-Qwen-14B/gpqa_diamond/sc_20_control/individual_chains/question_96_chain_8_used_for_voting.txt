Okay, so I've got this question about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, let me think through this. I'm a bit rusty on some of the formulas, but I'll try to piece it together.

The question says that the angular size of the event horizon is theta = 1e-17 degrees, and the distance d is 1e10 parsecs. I need to find the entropy's order of magnitude. The options are A to D, all in 10^something J/K.

First, I remember that the angular size is related to the actual size (like the radius) of the event horizon. The formula for angular size is theta ≈ diameter / distance, right? Because for small angles, tan(theta) ≈ theta in radians. So the diameter would be about theta * distance.

Wait, the distance is given in parsecs. Oh, right, 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So 1e10 parsecs is 3.086e26 meters. Let me calculate that. 1e10 * 3.086e16 = 3.086e26 meters.

Theta is in degrees, so I need to convert that to radians. To convert degrees to radians, multiply by pi/180. So 1e-17 degrees is 1e-17 * (pi/180) radians. Let me compute that. Pi is approx 3.1416, so 3.1416/180 is about 0.01745. So 1e-17 * 0.01745 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

Now, the diameter of the event horizon is approximately theta * distance. So diameter D = theta_rad * d = 1.745e-19 rad * 3.086e26 m. Let me multiply those. 1.745e-19 * 3.086e26 = 1.745 * 3.086 is about 5.37e7, but exponents are 1e7 (because 1e-19 *1e26 is 1e7). So D ≈ 5.37e7 meters. Wait, but the diameter of the event horizon is 2 times the Schwarzschild radius, right? Because the Schwarzschild radius R_s = 2GM/c², and the event horizon is at R_s.

Wait, actually, the Schwarzschild radius is R_s = 2GM/c². So the diameter is 2R_s = 2*(2GM/c²) = 4GM/c². Wait no, wait. The Schwarzschild radius is R_s, so diameter is 2 R_s. So in our case, D = 2 R_s. So from the calculation, D = 5.37e7 meters, which is 2 R_s. So R_s = D / 2 = 5.37e7 / 2 ≈ 2.685e7 meters.

Wait, but wait a second, maybe I should check that again. Oh wait, the diameter is 2 R_s, correct. So R_s = D / 2. Got it.

Now, knowing R_s, we can find the mass of the black hole. The formula for R_s is 2 G M / c². So solving for M: M = (R_s * c²) / (2 G). Let me plug in the numbers.

R_s is 2.685e7 meters. c is 3e8 m/s. G is 6.674e-11 N m²/kg².

So M = (2.685e7 m) * (9e16 m²/s²) / (2 * 6.674e-11 N m²/kg²)

Let me compute numerator first: 2.685e7 * 9e16 = 2.4165e24.

Denominator: 2 * 6.674e-11 = 1.3348e-10.

So M = 2.4165e24 / 1.3348e-10 = let's compute that. 2.4165e24 / 1.3348e-10 ≈ (2.4165 / 1.3348) * 1e34. 2.4165 / 1.3348 is approximately 1.809. So M ≈ 1.809e34 kg.

Wait, that's a really large mass. Well, supermassive black holes can be millions to billions of solar masses, and a solar mass is about 2e30 kg. 1e34 kg is 1e4 solar masses, so that's a plausible mass for a supermassive black hole.

Now, entropy of a black hole is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula: S = (k c^3 A) / (4 G ħ), where A is the area of the event horizon.

Wait, more accurately, the formula is S = ( (k_B c^3) / (4 ħ G) ) * (A), where A is the area of the event horizon.

Alternatively, I've seen it written as S = (k_B A c^3) / (4 ħ G). But I think the exact factors might vary, but the key is A is the area.

So I need to compute A, which is the area of the event horizon, which is a sphere with radius R_s. So A = 4 pi R_s^2.

Once I have A, plug into the entropy formula.

We already have R_s = 2.685e7 meters. So let's compute A:

A = 4 * pi * (2.685e7 m)^2.

Calculating (2.685e7)^2: 2.685^2 is about 7.21, and 1e7 squared is 1e14. So 7.21e14 m². Multiply by 4 pi: 4 * 3.1416 is approximately 12.566. So 12.566 * 7.21e14 ≈ 9.04e15 m².

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

(2.685e7)^2 = (2.685)^2 * 1e14 = 7.213 * 1e14 = 7.213e14 m².

Multiply by 4 pi: 4 * 3.1416 ≈ 12.566. So 12.566 * 7.213e14 = let's compute 12.566 *7.213.

12 *7 is 84, 12 *0.213= ~2.556, 0.566*7= ~3.962, 0.566*0.213≈0.120. Adding all: 84 +2.556=86.556 +3.962=90.518 +0.120=90.638. So about 90.638e14 m², which is 9.0638e15 m². Let's approximate A ≈ 9.06e15 m².

Now, entropy S = (k_B c^3 A) / (4 ħ G).

Let me plug in the values. Let me remember the constants:

k_B (Boltzmann's constant) is 1.38e-23 J/K.

c is 3e8 m/s.

ħ (h-bar) is approximately 1.055e-34 J·s.

G is 6.674e-11 N·m²/kg².

So compute numerator: k_B * c^3 * A.

k_B: 1.38e-23 J/K.

c^3: (3e8)^3 = 27e24 m^3/s^3.

A: 9.06e15 m².

So numerator: 1.38e-23 * 27e24 * 9.06e15.

Let me compute each step:

1.38e-23 * 27e24 = 1.38 *27 * 1e1 = 37.26 *10 = 372.6.

Then, 372.6 * 9.06e15 = let's compute 372.6 *9.06 ≈ 3378. So 3378e15 = 3.378e18 J·m²/s³, but wait, units might complicate, but perhaps it's easier to plug in the numbers.

Wait, let's compute the exponents and coefficients separately.

Coefficient: 1.38 *27 = 37.26; 37.26 *9.06 ≈ 37.26 *9 = 335.34; 37.26 *0.06≈2.2356. So total ~337.58.

Exponents: 1e(-23) * 1e24 * 1e15 = 1e( -23 +24 +15 )= 1e16.

So numerator is approximately 337.58e16 = 3.3758e18 J·m²/s³?

Wait, wait, perhaps I should think in terms of exponents correctly. Let's see:

k_B: 1.38e-23,
c^3: 2.7e26 (since (3e8)^3 = 27e24 = 2.7e26),
A: 9.06e15.

So multiplying them: 1.38e-23 * 2.7e26 = (1.38 * 2.7) e ( -23 +26 ) = 3.726e3.

Then 3.726e3 *9.06e15 = (3.726 *9.06) e (3+15) = 33.76e18.

Wait, 3.726 *9.06 = approximately 33.77.

So the numerator is 33.77e18 → 3.377e19 J·m²/s³.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the exponents earlier. Let me double-check:

Wait, 1.38e-23 * 2.7e26 = 1.38 *2.7 =3.726, exponents 1e(-23+26)=1e3. So 3.726e3.

Multiply by 9.06e15: 3.726e3 *9.06e15 = (3.726 *9.06) * 1e(3+15) = 33.77 *1e18 = 3.377e19.

So numerator is about 3.377e19.

Denominator: 4 ħ G =4 * 1.055e-34 *6.674e-11.

Compute 4 * (1.055e-34 *6.674e-11).

1.055e-34 *6.674e-11 = (1.055 * 6.674) e (-34 -11 )= ~7.03e-46.

Multiply by 4: 4*7.03e-46 =28.12e-46 =2.812e-45.

So denominator is approximately 2.812e-45.

So S = numerator / denominator = (3.377e19) / (2.812e-45) = (3.377 / 2.812) *1e(19 +45) = 1.199 *1e64.

So approximately 1.2e64 J/K.

Wait, that's about 1e64, but looking at the options, they are in the 1e59, 1e62, 1e65, 1e66 J/K.

Wait, that's a problem because my calculation got 1e64, but the options don't have that. Wait, did I make an error in the calculation?

Wait, let me check the calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents somewhere. Let me go through each step again.

First, the area A: 4 pi R_s^2.

R_s =2.685e7 m.

R_s squared is (2.685e7)^2 = 7.21e14 m².

Multiply by 4 pi: 4 *3.1416 *7.21e14 = approx 9.04e15 m². So A=9.04e15 m².

Then, S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G).

Compute numerator: k_B * c^3 * A.

k_B = 1.38e-23 J/K.

c^3 = (3e8)^3 = 27e24 m³/s³.

Wait, 3e8 is 3*1e8, so cubed is 27e24.

So 1.38e-23 *27e24 = (1.38 *27) *1e( -23 +24 ) = 37.26 *1e1 =372.6.

Multiply by A=9.04e15 m²: 372.6 *9.04e15 = approx 3367.5e15 =3.3675e18.

Wait, but wait: 372.6 *9.04e15 = 372.6 *9.04 = approx 3373. So 3373e15 = 3.373e18.

Denominator:4 * ħ * G.

ħ is 1.055e-34 J·s.

G is 6.674e-11 N·m²/kg².

So 4 *1.055e-34 *6.674e-11 =4 * (1.055 *6.674) * 1e(-34-11) =4*(7.03) *1e-45 =28.12e-45 =2.812e-44? Wait, wait, 1e-34 *1e-11 is 1e-45. 1.055e-34 *6.674e-11 is (1.055 *6.674)e-45. 1.055 *6.674 ≈7.03e-45. Then multiply by 4: 4*7.03e-45=28.12e-45=2.812e-44? Wait no, 28.12e-45 is 2.812e-44? No, because 28.12e-45 is 2.812e-44 (since 28e-45 = 2.8e-44). So denominator is 2.812e-44.

Wait, no: 28.12e-45 is 2.812e-44 because 28.12 is 2.812 *10^1, so 10^1 *1e-45 is 1e-44.

So denominator is 2.812e-44.

So S = (3.373e18) / (2.812e-44) = (3.373 / 2.812) *1e(18 +44) = approx 1.199 * 1e62.

So S ≈ 1.199e62 J/K, which is about 1e62. Looking at the options, option A is 1e62.

Wait, that's option A: 1e62 J/K.

Wait, but earlier I thought I got 1e64, but that must have been a miscalculation. So this calculation gives approximately 1e62, which is option A.

Wait, but let me think again. Did I mess up any exponents?

Wait, k_B * c^3 * A: 1.38e-23 * (3e8)^3 =1.38e-23 *27e24 = 1.38 *27 *1e1 =37.26 *10 =372.6. Then 372.6 * A=9.04e15 m² → 372.6 *9.04e15 = 3.373e18.

Denominator:4 * ħ * G =4 *1.055e-34 *6.674e-11 =4*7.03e-45=2.812e-44.

So S = 3.373e18 / 2.812e-44 = (3.373 / 2.812) *1e(18 +44) = 1.199 *1e62 → 1.2e62 J/K.

That's around 1e62, so option A is 1e62.

Wait, but why did I earlier get 1e64? Because I think I might have miscalculated the exponents when I first did it quickly. So the correct calculation is 1e62.

So the answer should be option A) 1e62 J/K.

To determine the order of magnitude of the entropy of the supermassive black hole, we start by using the given angular size of the event horizon, \( \theta = 10^{-17} \, \text{degrees} \), and the distance \( d = 10^{10} \, \text{parsecs} \). The Schwarzschild radius \( R_s \) of the black hole can be derived from the angular size, as the diameter of the event horizon is approximately \( D = \theta \cdot d \). 

### Step 1: Convert distance to meters
The distance \( d \) in meters is calculated as:
\[
d = 10^{10} \, \text{parsecs} \times 3.086 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m/parsec} = 3.086 \times 10^{26} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 2: Convert angular size to radians
The angular size \( \theta \) in radians is:
\[
\theta = 10^{-17} \, \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \approx 1.745 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{radians}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Schwarzschild radius
The diameter of the event horizon is:
\[
D = \theta \cdot d = (1.745 \times 10^{-19}) \cdot (3.086 \times 10^{26}) \approx 5.37 \times 10^7 \, \text{m}.
\]
The Schwarzschild radius is half the diameter:
\[
R_s = \frac{D}{2} = \frac{5.37 \times 10^7}{2} \approx 2.685 \times 10^7 \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the area of the event horizon
The area \( A \) of the event horizon is:
\[
A = 4 \pi R_s^2 = 4 \pi (2.685 \times 10^7)^2 \approx 4 \pi (7.21 \times 10^{14}) \approx 9.04 \times 10^{15} \, \text{m}^2.
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the entropy of the black hole
The entropy \( S \) of a black hole is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula:
\[
S = \frac{k_B c^3 A}{4 \hbar G},
\]
where:
- \( k_B = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \) (Boltzmann constant),
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) (speed of light),
- \( \hbar = 1.055 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) (reduced Planck constant),
- \( G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{kg}^2 \) (gravitational constant).

#### Numerator:
\[
k_B c^3 A = (1.38 \times 10^{-23}) \cdot (3 \times 10^8)^3 \cdot (9.04 \times 10^{15}).
\]
First, calculate \( c^3 \):
\[
c^3 = (3 \times 10^8)^3 = 27 \times 10^{24} = 2.7 \times 10^{25}.
\]
Then:
\[
k_B c^3 A = (1.38 \times 10^{-23}) \cdot (2.7 \times 10^{25}) \cdot (9.04 \times 10^{15}).
\]
Combine coefficients:
\[
1.38 \cdot 2.7 \cdot 9.04 \approx 33.77.
\]
Combine exponents:
\[
10^{-23} \cdot 10^{25} \cdot 10^{15} = 10^{17}.
\]
Thus:
\[
k_B c^3 A \approx 33.77 \times 10^{17} = 3.377 \times 10^{18} \, \text{J·m}^2/\text{s}^3.
\]

#### Denominator:
\[
4 \hbar G = 4 \cdot (1.055 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (6.674 \times 10^{-11}).
\]
First, calculate \( \hbar G \):
\[
\hbar G = (1.055 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (6.674 \times 10^{-11}) \approx 7.03 \times 10^{-45}.
\]
Then:
\[
4 \hbar G = 4 \cdot 7.03 \times 10^{-45} = 28.12 \times 10^{-45} = 2.812 \times 10^{-44}.
\]

#### Entropy:
\[
S = \frac{k_B c^3 A}{4 \hbar G} = \frac{3.377 \times 10^{18}}{2.812 \times 10^{-44}}.
\]
Combine coefficients:
\[
\frac{3.377}{2.812} \approx 1.199.
\]
Combine exponents:
\[
10^{18} / 10^{-44} = 10^{62}.
\]
Thus:
\[
S \approx 1.199 \times 10^{62} \, \text{J/K}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The entropy of the black hole is approximately \( 10^{62} \, \text{J/K} \), which corresponds to option **A**.

Answer: A

Okay, so I've got this question about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, let me think through this. I'm a bit rusty on some of the formulas, but I'll try to piece it together.

The question says that the angular size of the event horizon is theta = 1e-17 degrees, and the distance d is 1e10 parsecs. I need to find the entropy's order of magnitude. The options are A to D, all in 10^something J/K.

First, I remember that the angular size is related to the actual size (like the radius) of the event horizon. The formula for angular size is theta ≈ diameter / distance, right? Because for small angles, tan(theta) ≈ theta in radians. So the diameter would be about theta * distance.

Wait, the distance is given in parsecs. Oh, right, 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So 1e10 parsecs is 3.086e26 meters. Let me calculate that. 1e10 * 3.086e16 = 3.086e26 meters.

Theta is in degrees, so I need to convert that to radians. To convert degrees to radians, multiply by pi/180. So 1e-17 degrees is 1e-17 * (pi/180) radians. Let me compute that. Pi is approx 3.1416, so 3.1416/180 is about 0.01745. So 1e-17 * 0.01745 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

Now, the diameter of the event horizon is approximately theta * distance. So diameter D = theta_rad * d = 1.745e-19 rad * 3.086e26 m. Let me multiply those. 1.745e-19 * 3.086e26 = 1.745 * 3.086 is about 5.37e7, but exponents are 1e7 (because 1e-19 *1e26 is 1e7). So D ≈ 5.37e7 meters. Wait, but the diameter of the event horizon is 2 times the Schwarzschild radius, right? Because the Schwarzschild radius R_s = 2GM/c², and the event horizon is at R_s.

Wait, actually, the Schwarzschild radius is R_s = 2GM/c². So the diameter is 2R_s = 2*(2GM/c²) = 4GM/c². Wait no, wait. The Schwarzschild radius is R_s, so diameter is 2 R_s. So in our case, D = 2 R_s. So from the calculation, D = 5.37e7 meters, which is 2 R_s. So R_s = D / 2 = 5.37e7 / 2 ≈ 2.685e7 meters.

Wait, but wait a second, maybe I should check that again. Oh wait, the diameter is 2 R_s, correct. So R_s = D / 2. Got it.

Now, knowing R_s, we can find the mass of the black hole. The formula for R_s is 2 G M / c². So solving for M: M = (R_s * c²) / (2 G). Let me plug in the numbers.

R_s is 2.685e7 meters. c is 3e8 m/s. G is 6.674e-11 N m²/kg².

So M = (2.685e7 m) * (9e16 m²/s²) / (2 * 6.674e-11 N m²/kg²)

Let me compute numerator first: 2.685e7 * 9e16 = 2.4165e24.

Denominator: 2 * 6.674e-11 = 1.3348e-10.

So M = 2.4165e24 / 1.3348e-10 = let's compute that. 2.4165e24 / 1.3348e-10 ≈ (2.4165 / 1.3348) * 1e34. 2.4165 / 1.3348 is approximately 1.809. So M ≈ 1.809e34 kg.

Wait, that's a really large mass. Well, supermassive black holes can be millions to billions of solar masses, and a solar mass is about 2e30 kg. 1e34 kg is 1e4 solar masses, so that's a plausible mass for a supermassive black hole.

Now, entropy of a black hole is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula: S = (k c^3 A) / (4 G ħ), where A is the area of the event horizon.

Wait, more accurately, the formula is S = ( (k_B c^3) / (4 ħ G) ) * (A), where A is the area of the event horizon.

Alternatively, I've seen it written as S = (k_B A c^3) / (4 ħ G). But I think the exact factors might vary, but the key is A is the area.

So I need to compute A, which is the area of the event horizon, which is a sphere with radius R_s. So A = 4 pi R_s^2.

Once I have A, plug into the entropy formula.

We already have R_s = 2.685e7 meters. So let's compute A:

A = 4 * pi * (2.685e7 m)^2.

Calculating (2.685e7)^2: 2.685^2 is about 7.21, and 1e7 squared is 1e14. So 7.21e14 m². Multiply by 4 pi: 4 * 3.1416 is approximately 12.566. So 12.566 * 7.21e14 ≈ 9.04e15 m².

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

(2.685e7)^2 = (2.685)^2 * 1e14 = 7.213 * 1e14 = 7.213e14 m².

Multiply by 4 pi: 4 * 3.1416 ≈ 12.566. So 12.566 * 7.213e14 = let's compute 12.566 *7.213.

12 *7 is 84, 12 *0.213= ~2.556, 0.566*7= ~3.962, 0.566*0.213≈0.120. Adding all: 84 +2.556=86.556 +3.962=90.518 +0.120=90.638. So about 90.638e14 m², which is 9.0638e15 m². Let's approximate A ≈ 9.06e15 m².

Now, entropy S = (k_B c^3 A) / (4 ħ G).

Let me plug in the values. Let me remember the constants:

k_B (Boltzmann's constant) is 1.38e-23 J/K.

c is 3e8 m/s.

ħ (h-bar) is approximately 1.055e-34 J·s.

G is 6.674e-11 N·m²/kg².

So compute numerator: k_B * c^3 * A.

k_B: 1.38e-23 J/K.

c^3: (3e8)^3 = 27e24 m^3/s^3.

A: 9.06e15 m².

So numerator: 1.38e-23 * 27e24 * 9.06e15.

Let me compute each step:

1.38e-23 * 27e24 = 1.38 *27 * 1e1 = 37.26 *10 = 372.6.

Then, 372.6 * 9.06e15 = let's compute 372.6 *9.06 ≈ 3378. So 3378e15 = 3.378e18 J·m²/s³, but wait, units might complicate, but perhaps it's easier to plug in the numbers.

Wait, let's compute the exponents and coefficients separately.

Coefficient: 1.38 *27 = 37.26; 37.26 *9.06 ≈ 37.26 *9 = 335.34; 37.26 *0.06≈2.2356. So total ~337.58.

Exponents: 1e(-23) * 1e24 * 1e15 = 1e( -23 +24 +15 )= 1e16.

So numerator is approximately 337.58e16 = 3.3758e18 J·m²/s³?

Wait, wait, perhaps I should think in terms of exponents correctly. Let's see:

k_B: 1.38e-23,
c^3: 2.7e26 (since (3e8)^3 = 27e24 = 2.7e26),
A: 9.06e15.

So multiplying them: 1.38e-23 * 2.7e26 = (1.38 * 2.7) e ( -23 +26 ) = 3.726e3.

Then 3.726e3 *9.06e15 = (3.726 *9.06) e (3+15) = 33.76e18.

Wait, 3.726 *9.06 = approximately 33.77.

So the numerator is 33.77e18 → 3.377e19 J·m²/s³.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the exponents earlier. Let me double-check:

Wait, 1.38e-23 * 2.7e26 = 1.38 *2.7 =3.726, exponents 1e(-23+26)=1e3. So 3.726e3.

Multiply by 9.06e15: 3.726e3 *9.06e15 = (3.726 *9.06) * 1e(3+15) = 33.77 *1e18 = 3.377e19.

So numerator is about 3.377e19.

Denominator: 4 ħ G =4 * 1.055e-34 *6.674e-11.

Compute 4 * (1.055e-34 *6.674e-11).

1.055e-34 *6.674e-11 = (1.055 * 6.674) e (-34 -11 )= ~7.03e-46.

Multiply by 4: 4*7.03e-46 =28.12e-46 =2.812e-45.

So denominator is approximately 2.812e-45.

So S = numerator / denominator = (3.377e19) / (2.812e-45) = (3.377 / 2.812) *1e(19 +45) = 1.199 *1e64.

So approximately 1.2e64 J/K.

Wait, that's about 1e64, but looking at the options, they are in the 1e59, 1e62, 1e65, 1e66 J/K.

Wait, that's a problem because my calculation got 1e64, but the options don't have that. Wait, did I make an error in the calculation?

Wait, let me check the calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents somewhere. Let me go through each step again.

First, the area A: 4 pi R_s^2.

R_s =2.685e7 m.

R_s squared is (2.685e7)^2 = 7.21e14 m².

Multiply by 4 pi: 4 *3.1416 *7.21e14 = approx 9.04e15 m². So A=9.04e15 m².

Then, S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G).

Compute numerator: k_B * c^3 * A.

k_B = 1.38e-23 J/K.

c^3 = (3e8)^3 = 27e24 m³/s³.

Wait, 3e8 is 3*1e8, so cubed is 27e24.

So 1.38e-23 *27e24 = (1.38 *27) *1e( -23 +24 ) = 37.26 *1e1 =372.6.

Multiply by A=9.04e15 m²: 372.6 *9.04e15 = approx 3367.5e15 =3.3675e18.

Wait, but wait: 372.6 *9.04e15 = 372.6 *9.04 = approx 3373. So 3373e15 = 3.373e18.

Denominator:4 * ħ * G.

ħ is 1.055e-34 J·s.

G is 6.674e-11 N·m²/kg².

So 4 *1.055e-34 *6.674e-11 =4 * (1.055 *6.674) * 1e(-34-11) =4*(7.03) *1e-45 =28.12e-45 =2.812e-44? Wait, wait, 1e-34 *1e-11 is 1e-45. 1.055e-34 *6.674e-11 is (1.055 *6.674)e-45. 1.055 *6.674 ≈7.03e-45. Then multiply by 4: 4*7.03e-45=28.12e-45=2.812e-44? Wait no, 28.12e-45 is 2.812e-44? No, because 28.12e-45 is 2.812e-44 (since 28e-45 = 2.8e-44). So denominator is 2.812e-44.

Wait, no: 28.12e-45 is 2.812e-44 because 28.12 is 2.812 *10^1, so 10^1 *1e-45 is 1e-44.

So denominator is 2.812e-44.

So S = (3.373e18) / (2.812e-44) = (3.373 / 2.812) *1e(18 +44) = approx 1.199 * 1e62.

So S ≈ 1.199e62 J/K, which is about 1e62. Looking at the options, option A is 1e62.

Wait, that's option A: 1e62 J/K.

Wait, but earlier I thought I got 1e64, but that must have been a miscalculation. So this calculation gives approximately 1e62, which is option A.

Wait, but let me think again. Did I mess up any exponents?

Wait, k_B * c^3 * A: 1.38e-23 * (3e8)^3 =1.38e-23 *27e24 = 1.38 *27 *1e1 =37.26 *10 =372.6. Then 372.6 * A=9.04e15 m² → 372.6 *9.04e15 = 3.373e18.

Denominator:4 * ħ * G =4 *1.055e-34 *6.674e-11 =4*7.03e-45=2.812e-44.

So S = 3.373e18 / 2.812e-44 = (3.373 / 2.812) *1e(18 +44) = 1.199 *1e62 → 1.2e62 J/K.

That's around 1e62, so option A is 1e62.

Wait, but why did I earlier get 1e64? Because I think I might have miscalculated the exponents when I first did it quickly. So the correct calculation is 1e62.

So the answer should be option A) 1e62 J/K.


To determine the order of magnitude of the entropy of the supermassive black hole, we start by using the given angular size of the event horizon, \( \theta = 10^{-17} \, \text{degrees} \), and the distance \( d = 10^{10} \, \text{parsecs} \). The Schwarzschild radius \( R_s \) of the black hole can be derived from the angular size, as the diameter of the event horizon is approximately \( D = \theta \cdot d \). 

### Step 1: Convert distance to meters
The distance \( d \) in meters is calculated as:
\[
d = 10^{10} \, \text{parsecs} \times 3.086 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m/parsec} = 3.086 \times 10^{26} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 2: Convert angular size to radians
The angular size \( \theta \) in radians is:
\[
\theta = 10^{-17} \, \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \approx 1.745 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{radians}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Schwarzschild radius
The diameter of the event horizon is:
\[
D = \theta \cdot d = (1.745 \times 10^{-19}) \cdot (3.086 \times 10^{26}) \approx 5.37 \times 10^7 \, \text{m}.
\]
The Schwarzschild radius is half the diameter:
\[
R_s = \frac{D}{2} = \frac{5.37 \times 10^7}{2} \approx 2.685 \times 10^7 \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the area of the event horizon
The area \( A \) of the event horizon is:
\[
A = 4 \pi R_s^2 = 4 \pi (2.685 \times 10^7)^2 \approx 4 \pi (7.21 \times 10^{14}) \approx 9.04 \times 10^{15} \, \text{m}^2.
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the entropy of the black hole
The entropy \( S \) of a black hole is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula:
\[
S = \frac{k_B c^3 A}{4 \hbar G},
\]
where:
- \( k_B = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \) (Boltzmann constant),
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) (speed of light),
- \( \hbar = 1.055 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) (reduced Planck constant),
- \( G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{kg}^2 \) (gravitational constant).

#### Numerator:
\[
k_B c^3 A = (1.38 \times 10^{-23}) \cdot (3 \times 10^8)^3 \cdot (9.04 \times 10^{15}).
\]
First, calculate \( c^3 \):
\[
c^3 = (3 \times 10^8)^3 = 27 \times 10^{24} = 2.7 \times 10^{25}.
\]
Then:
\[
k_B c^3 A = (1.38 \times 10^{-23}) \cdot (2.7 \times 10^{25}) \cdot (9.04 \times 10^{15}).
\]
Combine coefficients:
\[
1.38 \cdot 2.7 \cdot 9.04 \approx 33.77.
\]
Combine exponents:
\[
10^{-23} \cdot 10^{25} \cdot 10^{15} = 10^{17}.
\]
Thus:
\[
k_B c^3 A \approx 33.77 \times 10^{17} = 3.377 \times 10^{18} \, \text{J·m}^2/\text{s}^3.
\]

#### Denominator:
\[
4 \hbar G = 4 \cdot (1.055 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (6.674 \times 10^{-11}).
\]
First, calculate \( \hbar G \):
\[
\hbar G = (1.055 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (6.674 \times 10^{-11}) \approx 7.03 \times 10^{-45}.
\]
Then:
\[
4 \hbar G = 4 \cdot 7.03 \times 10^{-45} = 28.12 \times 10^{-45} = 2.812 \times 10^{-44}.
\]

#### Entropy:
\[
S = \frac{k_B c^3 A}{4 \hbar G} = \frac{3.377 \times 10^{18}}{2.812 \times 10^{-44}}.
\]
Combine coefficients:
\[
\frac{3.377}{2.812} \approx 1.199.
\]
Combine exponents:
\[
10^{18} / 10^{-44} = 10^{62}.
\]
Thus:
\[
S \approx 1.199 \times 10^{62} \, \text{J/K}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The entropy of the black hole is approximately \( 10^{62} \, \text{J/K} \), which corresponds to option **A**.
