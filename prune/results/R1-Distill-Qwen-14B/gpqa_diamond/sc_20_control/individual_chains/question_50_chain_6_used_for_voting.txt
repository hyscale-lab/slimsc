Alright, so I've got this question here about quantum field theory and Feynman diagrams. Hmm, okay, let's think through this. The question is about figuring out how many loops a Feynman diagram has based on the "size estimate" written next to it.

The note says the size estimate is alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. I remember that in quantum field theory, loop diagrams contribute to the calculation of amplitudes, and each loop typically comes with certain factors.

Let me break down the factors. Alpha is the fine-structure constant, usually around 1/137. G might be a coupling constant, like the strong coupling constant in QCD. The sqrt(2) and 8 are numbers, but the key parts are the powers of pi and the exponents on other constants.

In loop integrals, each loop contributes a factor of (1/(4π)^n), where n depends on the number of loops. Wait, I think each loop in four-dimensional spacetime contributes a 1/(16π^2) factor because of the integration over loop momentum. Or wait, maybe it's 1/(4π)^something. Let me think about dimensional analysis. Each loop in a Feynman integral in 4D typically brings a 1/(16 π²) factor for each loop. So, for m loops, that would be (1/(16 π²))^m. Alternatively, sometimes it's written as (1/(4π^m)) but I'm not too sure. Alternatively, each loop contributes a factor of 1/(4π^2), so m loops would be (1/(4π²))^m. Wait, I need to get this right.

Wait, the denominator in the given size estimate is (4pi)^6. So that's (4π)^6. So the exponent is 6, so 4pi to the 6th power. So if each loop contributes a 4pi factor squared, then 4pi squared per loop. So for m loops, it would be (4pi)^(2m). Therefore, (4pi)^6 would mean 2m =6 → m=3. So the number of loops is 3.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the general form. The loop integral in four dimensions for a one-loop diagram would contribute a factor like 1/(16 π²), which is (1/ (4 π)^2). So each loop adds a 1/(4 π)^2 factor. So for m loops, it would be (1/(4π^2))^m.

So in the given expression, the denominator is (4pi)^6. That would be (4 pi)^6 = (4 pi)^ (2 *3). So m=3. So the diagram has 3 loops.

Looking at the options, D is 3. So the answer should be D.

To determine the number of loops in the Feynman diagram, we analyze the given "size estimate": 

\[
\alpha^3 \cdot g^2 \cdot \sqrt{2} \cdot 8 \cdot \frac{1}{(4\pi)^6} \cdot \frac{Q^2}{M^2}.
\]

In quantum field theory, each loop in a Feynman diagram contributes a factor of \(1/(4\pi)^2\) to the amplitude. For \(m\) loops, the contribution becomes \((1/(4\pi)^2)^m = 1/(4\pi)^{2m}\). In the given expression, the denominator is \((4\pi)^6\), which corresponds to \((4\pi)^{2m}\) with \(2m = 6\). Solving for \(m\), we find \(m = 3\).

Thus, the Feynman diagram contains **3 loops**.
