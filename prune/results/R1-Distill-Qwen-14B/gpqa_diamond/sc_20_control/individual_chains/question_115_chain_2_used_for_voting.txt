Alright, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Okay, let's read the question again and make sure I understand what's going on.

So, an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured. One is moving upper-right, the other lower-right. The question is asking for the angle between the directions of the photons. The options are A)74, B)172, C)138, D)96.

Hmm. Okay, so first, I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons. Since it's an electron and a positron annihilating, they should produce at least two photons because of conservation of momentum and energy. Also, since the problem states that both photons have the same energy, that suggests some symmetry.

Wait, but when you have an electron and positron annihilating, their rest masses are the same, so their total rest energy is 2mc². But their kinetic energies also matter because they're moving with some Lorentz factors. Oh right, the Lorentz factor is gamma, which affects the total energy. So each particle's total energy is gamma times their rest energy.

Let me think. The electron's gamma is 4, so its energy is 4 * mc². The positron's gamma is 2, so its energy is 2 * mc². Since they're moving towards each other, I should consider their momenta. Electrons and positrons have the same mass, so their momenta will depend on their velocities and gamma.

Wait, momentum p is gamma * m * v. But for an electron and positron, since they're moving in opposite directions, their momenta will be opposite. So the total momentum before annihilation is the sum of the electron's momentum and the positron's momentum. Let me calculate that.

Electron's momentum: p_e = gamma_e * m * v_e
Positron's momentum: p_p = gamma_p * m * v_p
But wait, the positron is moving to the left (since it's coming from the right and moving along the horizontal axis), so its momentum would be in the opposite direction. So the total momentum would be p_e - p_p.

Wait, but maybe I should consider their velocities in terms of gamma. Alternatively, since gamma is given, perhaps I can find the velocities.

Wait, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So for each particle, I can find v in terms of gamma.

But maybe it's easier to calculate the total energy and total momentum, then find the conditions for the photons.

So, the total energy before annihilation is E_electron + E_positron. Each is gamma * m c². So E_total = (4 + 2) m c² = 6 m c².

The total momentum is p_e - p_p (since positron is moving opposite to the electron). Let's compute p_e and p_p.

p_e = gamma_e * m v_e
p_p = gamma_p * m v_p

But wait, for each, v can be found from gamma. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express their momenta in terms of gamma and the velocity.

Wait, another approach: for each particle, the momentum can be expressed as p = gamma m v, and also, since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), we can relate v and gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the total momentum, and then when the photons are emitted, their momenta must add up to that.

Since after annihilation, two photons are produced, each with energy E_photon. The problem says both photons have the same energy, so E1 = E2 = E.

Total energy after annihilation is 2E, which should equal the total energy before, which is 6 m c². So,

2E = 6 m c² → E = 3 m c².

Wait, but photons' energy is also related to their momentum by E = pc. So each photon's momentum is E/c = (3 m c²)/c = 3 m c.

So each photon has momentum magnitude 3 m c. But their directions are upper-right and lower-right. So their momenta are vectors.

So the total momentum of the two photons must equal the initial total momentum of the system.

Let me denote the initial system's total momentum as P_initial.

So, P_initial = p_e - p_p (since positron is moving opposite).

Wait, wait, no. The electron is moving to the right (from the left), and the positron is moving to the left (from the right). So their initial momenta are in opposite directions. So P_initial = p_e (right) + p_p (left) but wait, no, because if the positron is moving left, its momentum is opposite to the electron's.

Wait, maybe I should compute the momentum magnitudes and see their directions. Let me think.

Electron: moving from left to right (along +x direction). Its momentum is p_e = gamma_e * m * v_e.

Positron: moving from right to left (along -x direction). Its momentum is p_p = gamma_p * m * v_p.

So the total initial momentum is p_initial = p_e - p_p. Because the positron's momentum is in the opposite direction.

Wait, but how do I calculate p_e and p_p in terms of gamma?

Hmm, another approach: since gamma is given, the velocity can be found from gamma. Because gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²).

Wait, let's compute that.

For the electron, gamma_e = 4.

v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(4)^2) = c * sqrt(1 - 1/16) = c * sqrt(15/16) = c * (sqrt(15)/4) ≈ c * (3.87298)/4 ≈ 0.9682 c.

Similarly, for the positron, gamma_p = 2.

v_p = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(2)^2) = c * sqrt(3/4) = c * (sqrt(3)/2) ≈ 0.8660 c.

So the electron's velocity is to the right (v_e), and the positron's velocity is to the left (v_p).

So their momenta:

p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e = 4 m c (0.9682 c) → Wait, no, units might get messy, but perhaps it's better to keep in terms of mc.

Wait, let's calculate it more carefully.

p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e.

v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma_e)^2) = c * sqrt(1 - 1/16) = c * (sqrt(15)/4).

So p_e = 4 * m * (sqrt(15)/4 c) = m * sqrt(15) c.

Similarly, for the positron, moving left, its velocity is v_p = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(2)^2) = c * sqrt(3/4) = (sqrt(3)/2) c.

p_p = gamma_p * m * v_p = 2 * m * (sqrt(3)/2 c) = m * sqrt(3) c.

So the total initial momentum is p_initial = p_e (to the right) - p_p (to the left) → since the positron is moving left, its momentum is negative.

Wait, no: if the positron is moving to the left, its momentum is negative in the x-direction.

So p_initial = p_e (right, positive) + (-p_p) (since it's left, so negative).

So p_initial = m * sqrt(15) c - m * sqrt(3) c = m c [ sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ].

Wait, sqrt(15) is about 3.872, sqrt(3) is about 1.732. So sqrt(15)-sqrt(3) ≈ 2.14. So p_initial ≈ 2.14 m c.

Wait, but wait, the positron's momentum is in the opposite direction. So the total momentum is p_initial = p_e (right) + p_p (left), which is p_e - p_p.

Wait, no, because p_p is in the left direction. So in terms of vectors, suppose right is positive x. Then p_initial = p_e (positive) + (-p_p) (since it's moving left). So yes, p_initial = p_e - p_p.

So, the initial momentum is (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m c ≈ (3.872 - 1.732) m c ≈ 2.14 m c in the positive x-direction.

After annihilation, the two photons must have a combined momentum equal to the initial momentum.

Each photon's momentum is a vector. Let's denote the two photons as photon 1 and photon 2.

Photon 1 is moving in the upper-right direction, so its momentum vector has positive x and positive y components.

Photon 2 is moving in the lower-right direction, so its momentum vector has positive x and negative y components.

Each photon's energy is E = 3 m c², so their momentum magnitudes are p_photon = E/c = 3 m c.

Let me write vectorially.

Let’s denote the angles of the photons with the x-axis. Let’s say photon 1 makes an angle θ above the x-axis, and photon 2 makes an angle φ below the x-axis. But since both are in the right direction, their x-components are positive.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, one is upper-right, the other lower-right. So both have positive x-components, and their y-components are in opposite directions.

So the total momentum after annihilation is the vector sum of the two photons' momenta.

So, the x-component of p_total = p1_x + p2_x = p_initial.

The y-component of p_total = p1_y + p2_y = 0, because the initial system has zero y-momentum (both particles are moving along the x-axis). So the total y-momentum after must be zero, which implies p1_y = -p2_y.

Now, each photon's momentum has magnitude p_photon = 3 m c.

So for photon 1: p1_x = 3 m c cos θ, p1_y = 3 m c sin θ.

For photon 2: p2_x = 3 m c cos φ, p2_y = 3 m c sin φ.

Wait, but photon 2 is moving in the lower-right direction, so φ is below the x-axis. So sin φ would be negative, but perhaps it's easier to denote φ as the angle below, so sin φ is negative.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to denote photon 2 as having an angle of -φ below the x-axis. So p2_y = 3 m c sin(-φ) = -3 m c sin φ.

So, the y-components must cancel: p1_y + p2_y = 3 m c sin θ - 3 m c sin φ = 0 → sin θ = sin φ.

Since both photons are in the right direction, their angles are between 0 and 180 degrees. So sin θ = sin φ could mean that θ = φ or θ = 180 - φ. But considering direction, if θ is above, φ is below, but their sines would be equal in magnitude. So let's say sin θ = sin φ, implying θ = φ and they are symmetric above and below, but since one is upper and the other lower, their angles are symmetric about the x-axis. So θ = φ, but one is positive, the other negative. But since the sum of their y-components is zero, that's correct.

Wait, but the problem states that the photons have the same energy and their directions are measured as upper-right and lower-right. So the angles θ and φ are symmetric with respect to the x-axis. So perhaps θ is the angle above, and φ is the angle below, and sin θ = sin φ → θ = φ, but in opposite directions.

Wait, but in any case, the sum of the y-components must be zero, so the two photons' y-momenta must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

So, sin θ = sin φ, but since one is positive and the other negative, perhaps θ = 180 - φ. Wait, no. Let me think: if θ is the angle above the x-axis, and φ is the angle below, then for the sines to match, perhaps θ = 180 - φ, but that's not right because sin(180 - φ) = sin φ. So for example, if θ is 60 degrees, then φ would be 60 degrees below, so their sines are the same in magnitude. So the y-components would cancel.

Wait, but let's proceed step by step.

We have:

Sum of x-components: 3 m c (cos θ + cos φ) = P_initial = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m c.

Sum of y-components: 3 m c (sin θ - sin φ) = 0 → sin θ = sin φ.

So from the y-component equation: sin θ = sin φ.

Which implies that either θ = φ + 2πn or θ = π - φ + 2πn. But since θ and φ are between 0 and π (as photons are moving right, angles are from 0 to 180), the possible scenario is θ = φ or θ = π - φ.

But if θ = φ, then their y-components would be same in sign, which can't cancel. So that's not possible because sin θ = sin φ, but for the y-components to cancel, one must be positive and the other negative. So the only way that sin θ = sin φ and y-components cancel is if θ = π - φ. Because then sin θ = sin (π - φ) = sin φ. But if θ is π - φ, then one angle is above, and the other is below, but let's see.

Wait, if θ = π - φ, that would mean that the two angles are supplementary. For example, if θ is 60 degrees, φ would be 120 degrees. But wait, that can't be because both photons are moving to the right, so their angles are measured from the x-axis, and both are in the right direction, but one above, the other below. So I think I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps θ is the angle above the x-axis, and φ is the angle below, so their sines would have opposite signs. So, sin θ = - sin φ. But wait, in that case, from the equation sin θ = sin φ, that would imply sin theta = sin phi, which would require either phi = theta + 2pi n or phi = pi - theta + 2pi n. But if theta is above and phi is below, then if phi = -theta, then sin phi = - sin theta, which would make the sum zero. But that's not covered by the equation sin theta = sin phi. So perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier setup.

Wait, let me re-examine the setup. The sum of the y-components is p1_y + p2_y = 0. So:

p1_y = 3 m c sin theta,

p2_y = 3 m c sin phi.

But since p2 is moving in the lower-right direction, phi is measured below the x-axis, so sin phi is negative. So p2_y = 3 m c sin(-phi') = -3 m c sin phi', where phi' is the magnitude of the angle below.

So the sum becomes 3 m c sin theta - 3 m c sin phi' = 0 → sin theta = sin phi'.

So theta and phi' are equal, meaning that the two photons make the same angle with the x-axis, one above and the other below. So theta = phi' = let's say alpha.

So their angles with the x-axis are alpha and -alpha (or 180 - alpha). Wait, perhaps that's the case. So if one photon is at angle alpha above, the other is at angle alpha below, making their y-components equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. So their sum is zero.

In that case, the sum of their x-components would be 3 m c (cos alpha + cos alpha) = 6 m c cos alpha.

But wait, the initial total momentum is (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m c ≈ 2.14 m c.

Wait, so 6 m c cos alpha = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m c → cos alpha = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6.

Let me compute that.

Compute sqrt(15) ≈ 3.87298,

sqrt(3) ≈ 1.73205,

So sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈ 3.87298 - 1.73205 ≈ 2.14093.

Divide by 6: 2.14093 /6 ≈ 0.35682.

So cos alpha ≈ 0.35682.

What's the angle alpha here? arccos(0.35682) ≈ let's see, cos(69 degrees) is about 0.358, which is close. So alpha is approximately 69 degrees.

Wait, but wait, arccos(0.35682) is approximately 69 degrees, yes.

So each photon makes an angle of 69 degrees above and below the x-axis.

But the question is asking for the angle between the two photons' directions.

So if one is at +69 degrees and the other at -69 degrees, the angle between them is 69 - (-69) = 138 degrees.

Wait, but let me think again. If one is at 69 degrees above, the other is 69 degrees below. The angle between them is 69 + 69 = 138 degrees. So the angle between the two photons would be 138 degrees.

Looking at the options, option C is 138. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Compute (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3))/6:

sqrt(15) = approximately 3.872983346,

sqrt(3) = approximately 1.732050808,

Subtract: 3.872983346 - 1.732050808 = 2.140932538.

Divide by 6: 2.140932538 /6 ≈ 0.3568220897.

So cos alpha ≈ 0.3568. So alpha ≈ arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69 degrees, yes.

So each photon is at 69 degrees above and below the x-axis, so the angle between them is 69 * 2 = 138 degrees.

So the answer should be option C)138.

To solve the problem, we analyze the collision and annihilation process of an electron and a positron, which produce two photons of equal energy. The goal is to determine the angle between the directions of the photons.

### Key Information:
1. **Initial Setup**:
   - The electron moves to the right with a Lorentz factor of 4.
   - The positron moves to the left with a Lorentz factor of 2.
   - Total energy before annihilation is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron:
     \[
     E_{\text{total}} = (\gamma_e + \gamma_p) m c^2 = (4 + 2) m c^2 = 6 m c^2.
     \]
   - The total momentum before annihilation is the vector sum of the momenta of the electron and positron:
     \[
     p_{\text{initial}} = p_e - p_p,
     \]
     where \( p_e = \gamma_e m v_e \) and \( p_p = \gamma_p m v_p \). Using the Lorentz factor relation \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), the velocities are calculated as:
     \[
     v_e = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_e^2}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{16}} = c \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4}, \quad
     v_p = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_p^2}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{4}} = c \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
     \]
     Substituting these into the momentum expressions:
     \[
     p_e = \gamma_e m v_e = 4 m c \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4} = m c \sqrt{15}, \quad
     p_p = \gamma_p m v_p = 2 m c \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = m c \sqrt{3}.
     \]
     Thus, the total momentum is:
     \[
     p_{\text{initial}} = p_e - p_p = m c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}).
     \]

2. **Photon Properties After Annihilation**:
   - The total energy after annihilation is shared equally between the two photons:
     \[
     E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{total}}}{2} = 3 m c^2.
     \]
   - The momentum of each photon is:
     \[
     p_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{photon}}}{c} = 3 m c.
     \]
   - The photons move in opposite directions above and below the x-axis, denoted by angles \( \theta \) and \( -\theta \) with respect to the x-axis.

3. **Conservation of Momentum**:
   - The x-components of the photons' momenta must sum to the initial momentum:
     \[
     p_{\text{initial}} = 3 m c (\cos \theta + \cos \theta) = 6 m c \cos \theta.
     \]
     Substituting \( p_{\text{initial}} = m c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}) \):
     \[
     6 m c \cos \theta = m c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}),
     \]
     \[
     \cos \theta = \frac{\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}}{6}.
     \]
   - Numerically:
     \[
     \sqrt{15} \approx 3.872, \quad \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732, \quad \sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3} \approx 2.141.
     \]
     \[
     \cos \theta = \frac{2.141}{6} \approx 0.357.
     \]
     \[
     \theta \approx \arccos(0.357) \approx 69^\circ.
     \]

4. **Angle Between the Photons**:
   - One photon moves at \( +69^\circ \) above the x-axis, and the other at \( -69^\circ \) below the x-axis.
   - The angle between the two photons is:
     \[
     \Delta \theta = \theta - (-\theta) = 2\theta = 2 \times 69^\circ = 138^\circ.
     \]

### Final Answer:
The angle between the directions of the photons is **138 degrees**.
