Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that there's a vector field f(r) which falls off radially as 1/r². The magnitude is f(r) = 1/r², and the field has non-zero components only along the radial direction in spherical coordinates. We need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, ∇ · f, inside a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.

Hmm. So first, I think I need to find the divergence of the vector field f(r). Since the field is only radial, I can probably write it in terms of the unit vector in spherical coordinates.

Wait, in spherical coordinates, a vector field with only a radial component would be f(r) = f_r(r) r̂, where r̂ is the unit radial vector. So the divergence in spherical coordinates for such a field is given by a specific formula. I remember that the divergence of a vector field with only the radial component is (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² f_r(r)).

Right, because the formula for divergence in spherical coordinates is:

∇ · **F** = (1/r²) ∂(r² F_r)/∂r + (1/(r sinθ)) ∂(F_θ sinθ)/∂θ + (1/(r sinθ)) ∂F_φ/∂φ.

But in this case, F_θ and F_φ are zero, so the other terms vanish. So the divergence simplifies to (1/r²) d/dr (r² F_r).

So, substituting F_r(r) = 1/r². Let's compute that.

Wait, wait. Wait a second, because f(r) is given as the magnitude. Wait, no, the problem says the field has non-zero component only along the radial direction. So f(r) as a vector is f_r(r) r̂, and f_r(r) is the radial component. But the problem states that the magnitude of the field is 1/r². So that would make f_r(r) = 1/r², because the magnitude is just the absolute value of the radial component since the others are zero.

So f(r) = (1/r²) r̂. So F_r = 1/r², F_θ = 0, F_φ=0.

So now, compute the divergence.

∇ · f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)).

Let me compute that. r² * (1/r²) is 1. So d/dr of 1 is zero. So the divergence is zero?

Wait, that can't be right. Because I remember that for the electric field of a point charge, which falls as 1/r², the divergence is zero except at the origin. Oh wait, but wait, when r is not zero, but considering the origin, the divergence might be a delta function or something, but in the integral over a finite volume, perhaps the integral is 4π times the charge, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, I'm supposed to calculate the volume integral of the divergence over a sphere of radius R. So the integral would be ∫ (∇ · f) dV over the volume.

From the divergence calculation, I thought ∇ · f was zero. So the integral would be zero, which is option D.

But wait, wait a second. Let me double-check that. Because sometimes when the field behaves as 1/r², it's similar to the electric field of a point charge, which has a divergence that's a delta function at the origin. So if the origin is inside the volume (R>0), then perhaps the divergence isn't zero?

Wait, wait, no. The divergence in the region r ≠ 0 is zero, because the electric field of a point charge is divergence-free except at the origin. So if the sphere includes the origin, then the divergence integral would include the origin, and the integral would be 4π times the charge enclosed.

Wait, but the charge enclosed would be the charge Q, and we know from Gauss's law that ∫ E · dA = Q_enc / ε₀ = E * 4π R² (because E is radial and uniform over the Gaussian surface). But E = Q/(4π ε₀ r²). So E * 4π R² = Q/(ε₀). So ∫ (∇ · E) dV = 4π Q / ε₀, which equals the charge enclosed.

Wait, but in this problem, the field is given as f(r) = 1/r², and it's radial. So let's say it's analogous to E in the electric field. So if f(r) is the electric field, then the divergence would be ∇ · E = (1/(ε₀)) ρ, where ρ is the charge density. For a point charge, ρ is a delta function at the origin, so ∇ · E is zero everywhere except at r=0, where it's a delta function.

So, when integrating ∇ · E over a volume that includes the origin, the integral would be 4π ρ(0) / ε₀, which is the total charge. But in this problem, our f(r) is 1/r² radial. Let's see, what's the divergence of f?

Wait, let me go back. f(r) is (1/r²) r̂, so the divergence is (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)) = (1/r²) d/dr (1) = 0. So, in all space except r=0, the divergence is zero. So the integral over the sphere of radius R would be zero, except if R=0? No, that can't be right. But wait, no, the divergence is zero except at the origin. So when integrating the divergence over any volume that doesn't include the origin, the integral is zero. But if the volume does include the origin, then the divergence has a delta function contribution. So the integral would be 4π times the strength of the source at the origin.

Wait, but wait, in our case, f(r) is given. Let me compute ∇ · f from scratch.

f(r) = (1/r²) r̂. So in spherical coordinates, the divergence would be:

∇ · f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² (1/r²)) ) 

Compute inside the derivative: r² * 1/r² = 1. The derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So ∇ · f = 0 everywhere except at r=0, where it might have a delta function.

So the integral over any volume not including the origin is zero. But if the volume does include the origin, then the integral would be 4π times the value of the flux through a small sphere around the origin.

Wait, but in the problem, the sphere is of radius R and is centered at the origin. So the origin is inside the sphere. So the integral ∫ (∇ · f) dV over this volume would be 4π times the value of f at the origin? Or perhaps it's related to the flux through the surface?

Wait, perhaps no. Because for a vector field F, the divergence theorem states that ∫ (∇ · F) dV = ∫ F · dA over the surface. So in this case, our F is f(r) = (1/r²) r̂.

Wait, but wait, if our F is f(r), then the surface integral would be ∫ F · dA. Let's compute that for a sphere of radius R.

F is radial, so F · dA = F_r * dA = (1/R²) * R² sinθ dθ dφ? Wait, no, the area element dA on a sphere is R² sinθ dθ dφ, and the dot product would be F · n̂ * dA, where n̂ is the outward normal, which is r̂. So F · n̂ is (1/R²) * R̂ · R̂ = 1/R².

So the surface integral would be ∫ (1/R²) * R² sinθ dθ dφ. The R² cancels, leaving ∫ sinθ dθ dφ. The integral over θ is from 0 to π, and φ from 0 to 2π.

The integral of sinθ dθ from 0 to π is 2. The integral of dφ from 0 to 2π is 2π. So 2 * 2π = 4π.

So according to the divergence theorem, ∫ (∇ · F) dV = 4π. But earlier, I computed ∇ · F as zero everywhere except the origin. So if the volume includes the origin, then ∇ · F may have a delta function term. So the integral would be 4π. But wait, the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, so perhaps the integral is 4π.

Wait, but in our problem, the question is to evaluate the integral of the divergence of f(r) inside the sphere. So f(r) is given as 1/r², and the divergence is zero except at r=0. But wait, perhaps the divergence is a delta function at the origin. So the integral over the entire space would be 4π times the source term at the origin. But the problem is only considering the sphere of radius R. So if R is non-zero, the origin is inside, so the integral would have a contribution from the delta function.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, so the integral over the volume would be the same as the integral over the origin's contribution, which would be the flux through any small sphere around the origin. Which we calculated as 4π. Therefore, the integral ∫ (∇ · f) dV is 4π.

But wait, I thought the divergence was zero. So I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute the divergence of f(r) = (1/r²) r̂.

∇ · f = (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)) )

= (1/(r²)) d/dr (1) = (1/(r²)) * 0 = 0, for r ≠ 0.

So for any point other than r=0, the divergence is zero. But at r=0, the function is singular. So in the context of distributions, the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, where it's a delta function. So the divergence would be ∇ · f = 4π δ(r), perhaps. Because the flux through a small sphere around the origin would be 4π.

Wait, but in the problem, the integral is over a sphere of radius R, which includes r=0. Therefore, the integral ∫ (∇ · f) dV would be 4π times the delta function at the origin, which is 4π times 1, because the delta function integrates to 1.

So the integral would be 4π. So the answer would be option A) 4π.

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused because the divergence seems to be zero at every point except the origin, but the integral over any volume containing the origin would be 4π, regardless of R. So the answer is 4π, which is option A.

But wait, looking back at the problem statement, the vector field is given as f(r), which is 1/r². So the divergence is zero except at the origin, leading to the integral being 4π. So option A is correct.

But wait, let me confirm. If we calculate the volume integral of divergence, which is zero except at origin, the integral over the sphere would be the same as the integral over the origin, which is 4π. So the correct answer is A) 4π.

Wait, but wait another thought. Let me think about the units. If f(r) is 1/r², what is it? Electric field has units of Newtons per Coulomb, which is N/C, but that's perhaps not directly relevant here. The divergence would have units of inverse volume. Hmm. Let me not get stuck on that.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the divergence calculation. Let me recompute.

f(r) = (1/r²) r̂.

Compute the divergence in spherical coordinates:

∇ · f = (1/r²) ∂(r² f_r)/∂r + other terms (which are zero).

f_r = 1/r². So r² f_r = r² * 1/(r²) )= 1.

d/dr (1) = 0. So ∇ · f = 0. So in the region r ≠ 0, divergence is zero. So the integral over the entire sphere would be zero. But wait, that contradicts the earlier approach.

Wait, no. Because the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, where it's a delta function. So the volume integral isn't zero because the divergence includes a delta function, which contributes 4π.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting conflicting results. Let me clarify.

In reality, the vector field f(r) = (1/r²) r̂ is the electric field of a point charge, and its divergence is ∇ · E = (ρ)/ε₀, where ρ is the charge density. For a point charge, ρ is δ³(r), so ∇ · E = (1/ε₀) δ³(r).

So the divergence of E is a delta function at the origin. Thus, when integrating ∇ · E over any volume that includes the origin, the integral becomes (1/ε₀) times the total charge. But in our problem, f(r) isn't scaled with 1/ε₀. So perhaps the divergence is (1/ε₀) δ(r), but in our case, the field is given as f(r) = 1/r² r̂, so the divergence is 4π δ(r). Because in Gaussian units, ∇ · E = 4π ρ, perhaps. Or in SI units, it's (1/ε₀) ρ.

Wait, I'm getting mixed up between units. Let me think in terms of the divergence of the electric field. In SI units, E(r) = (1/(4πε₀)) (q/r²) r̂. So the divergence of E is (1/(4πε₀)) (4π δ³(r)) ) = (1/ε₀) δ³(r). So ∇ · E = (1/ε₀) δ³(r).

But in our problem, the field is f(r) = (1/r²) r̂. Comparing to E, this would be f(r) = (4π/ (4πε₀)) (q/r²) r̂, which would imply that f is analogous to E with q scaled by 4π ε₀. So the divergence of f would be (1/(ε₀)) δ³(r) * (4π ε₀) ) ? No, wait, perhaps I'm complicating things.

Let me approach it from the perspective of the divergence theorem. The divergence theorem states that the integral of ∇ · f over a volume V is equal to the flux of f through the surface of V.

In this case, the surface is a sphere of radius R. The flux through the surface is ∫ f · dA.

f(r) on the sphere is (1/R²) r̂. The area element dA is R² sinθ dθ dφ r̂.

So f · dA = (1/R²) R² sinθ dθ dφ = sinθ dθ dφ.

The integral over the sphere is ∫ (sinθ dθ dφ) from θ=0 to π and φ=0 to 2π.

The integral of sinθ dθ from 0 to π is 2. The integral of dφ from 0 to 2π is 2π. So the total flux is 2 * 2π = 4π.

So according to the divergence theorem, ∫ (∇ · f) dV = 4π.

But earlier, when computing the divergence, I found it to be zero everywhere except at r=0. So the integral is 4π, which comes from the delta function at the origin.

So the correct answer is 4π, which is option A.

To solve the problem, we analyze the divergence of the given vector field **f(r)** and evaluate the volume integral of its divergence inside a sphere of radius \( R \) centered at the origin.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Vector Field Description**:  
   The vector field is given as \( \mathbf{f}(r) = \frac{1}{r^2} \hat{r} \), where \( \hat{r} \) is the radial unit vector in spherical coordinates. The field has only a radial component and falls off as \( 1/r^2 \).

2. **Divergence in Spherical Coordinates**:  
   For a vector field with only a radial component, the divergence in spherical coordinates is given by:  
   \[
   \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 f_r \right),
   \]  
   where \( f_r \) is the radial component of the field. Substituting \( f_r = \frac{1}{r^2} \):  
   \[
   \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 \cdot \frac{1}{r^2} \right) = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} (1) = 0.
   \]  
   Thus, the divergence of \( \mathbf{f} \) is zero everywhere except at \( r = 0 \), where the field is singular.

3. **Integral of the Divergence**:  
   The problem asks for the volume integral of \( \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} \) inside a sphere of radius \( R \). Since \( \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = 0 \) for \( r \neq 0 \), the integral over any region excluding the origin is zero. However, at \( r = 0 \), the divergence is singular and behaves like a delta function \( \delta^3(r) \), representing a point source.

4. **Divergence Theorem**:  
   Using the divergence theorem, the volume integral of \( \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} \) over the sphere is equal to the flux of \( \mathbf{f} \) through the surface of the sphere. The flux is computed as:  
   \[
   \int_{\text{surface}} \mathbf{f} \cdot d\mathbf{A} = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^\pi \mathbf{f} \cdot \hat{r} \, r^2 \sin\theta \, d\theta \, d\phi.
   \]  
   On the surface of the sphere (\( r = R \)), \( \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{R^2} \hat{r} \), and \( d\mathbf{A} = R^2 \sin\theta \, d\theta \, d\phi \). Thus:  
   \[
   \mathbf{f} \cdot d\mathbf{A} = \frac{1}{R^2} \cdot R^2 \sin\theta \, d\theta \, d\phi = \sin\theta \, d\theta \, d\phi.
   \]  
   The integral becomes:  
   \[
   \int_0^{2\pi} d\phi \int_0^\pi \sin\theta \, d\theta = 2\pi \cdot 2 = 4\pi.
   \]  
   Therefore, the flux through the surface is \( 4\pi \), and by the divergence theorem, the volume integral of \( \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} \) inside the sphere is also \( 4\pi \).

5. **Conclusion**:  
   The divergence of \( \mathbf{f} \) is zero everywhere except at the origin, where it contributes a delta function. The integral over the sphere of radius \( R \) accounts for this contribution, resulting in a value of \( 4\pi \).

### Final Answer:
The volume integral of the divergence of the field inside the sphere is \( 4\pi \).  
**Answer: A**
