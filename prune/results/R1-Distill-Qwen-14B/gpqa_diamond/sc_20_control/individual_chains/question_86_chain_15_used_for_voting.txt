Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question carefully.

The question says that a chemist performed two reactions using two different reducing agents on two unknown compounds, A and B. The products from both are given as (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, respectively. I need to determine the starting materials A and B from the given options.

Hmm, wait. So Reaction 1: A is treated with LiBH4 and H+ (probably an acid workup) to give (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Reaction 2: B is treated with BH3 and H+ to give (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.

Wait a second, I remember that LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, usually used for reducing esters, ketones, etc. But BH3 is often used in hydroboration reactions, which are different. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, I think I might be mixing things up. Let me think again. Oh, right! The reagents in these reactions might be for different types of reductions.

Wait, wait—I'm a bit confused. LiBH4 is a common reducing agent for carbonyl groups. BH3 is usually used for hydroboration, but in some cases, BH3 can be used as a reducing agent, perhaps in the presence of something else. Alternatively, maybe the conditions are different. Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the product is a ketone, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So the product is a cyclic ketone. Let me think about what kind of starting material would form this upon reduction.

Wait, if the product is a ketone, then perhaps the starting material was an ester or a carbonyl compound. Wait, but in the product, the ketone is at position 2 of the pyran ring. So the starting material would probably have a carbonyl group that, upon reduction, gives the ketone. Or wait, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ester, like a lactone, and upon reduction, it opens up?

Wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ketones with some protecting groups. Wait, not sure.

Wait, another approach: maybe the starting materials are epoxides? No, because reducing an epoxide would not form a ketone. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are lactones. Because when a lactone is reduced, it can form a diol, but I'm not sure how that would lead to a ketone.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reagents and what they do. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. It can reduce esters to alcohols. Wait, but in the product, we have a ketone. Hmm, so maybe the starting material for A is a ketone, and LiBH4 does something else? No, LiBH4 is more for reducing esters, amides, ketones, etc. Wait, LiBH4 can reduce esters to alcohols, but then that would form a secondary alcohol. But the product here is a ketone. That doesn't add up.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an acid derivative, like an acyl chloride or an ester. But how does that form a ketone upon reduction?

Wait, maybe the starting materials are cyclic esters, like lactones. Let's say the lactone is, for example, a gamma or delta lactone. When reduced, it could open up. But wait, no, because LiBH4 usually reduces esters (like lactones) to diols.

Wait, perhaps it's a different scenario. Maybe the starting materials are carbonyl-containing compounds, and the reduction leads to a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are ketals or acetals, and upon reduction, they form alcohols or other structures.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the stereochemistry. The products are (R) and (S) configurations. So the starting materials must have had some stereogenic centers that influence the outcome.

Wait, another thought: the product is a tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The structure of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one would be a six-membered ring (pyran), with a ketone at position 2 and an ethyl group at position 4. So the ring is a tetrahydropyran with the substituents.

Wait, I think that pyranone structures can be formed via a Robinson annulation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diacid or something that can cyclize into a pyran ring upon reduction.

Alternatively, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the reagents again. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically used for ketones, aldehydes, esters, etc. BH3 is used in hydroboration reactions, which are for adding boron to alkenes. But wait, BH3 can also be used as a reducing agent in some cases, perhaps for epoxides or other groups.

Wait, wait! Perhaps the starting materials are epoxides. Because when an epoxide is treated with a borane reagent, it can open, but that usually involves some acid catalysis. But BH3 is a Lewis acid, so maybe it's used in opening epoxides. Hmm.

Alternatively, another possibility: the starting materials are cyclic ethers with ketone groups. No, that might not fit.

Another approach: perhaps the starting materials are ketones themselves. But if so, reducing them with LiBH4 would give secondary alcohols, not ketones. So that doesn't fit the product.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are ketals. Let's say, a ketal derived from a ketone. When you reduce a ketal, you might get an alcohol. But that doesn't lead to a ketone itself.

Hmm. Maybe the starting materials are esters, and when reduced, they form alcohols. But the product is a ketone, so that might not fit.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are alpha-hydroxy esters. Because LiBH4 can reduce esters, but I'm not sure how that would lead to a ketone.

Alternatively, I'm missing something about the reagents. Let me think: LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, but BH3 is typically used in hydroboration reactions, which are for adding boron to alkenes. But BH3 can be used under certain conditions to reduce carbonyl groups as well. Wait, for example, BH3 is sometimes used in the reduction of esters to alcohols under specific conditions. Or maybe in the presence of a co-reagent.

Alternatively, perhaps the reactions involve the reduction of epoxides. Wait, when an epoxide is treated with LiBH4 or BH3, does it open up to form an alcohol?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, so perhaps I should think about what the product is and work backward. The product is (R) or (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let me imagine its structure. It's a six-membered ring, with oxygen at position 5 (since it's a pyran), with a ketone at position 2 and an ethyl group at position 4.

Wait, the positions are a bit tricky, but perhaps the ring is formed from a diol and a ketone. Alternatively, maybe the pyranone is formed via a ring-forming process.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the starting materials are esters of some sort, and upon reduction, they form the pyranone. For example, maybe they're cyclic esters (lactones) that, when reduced, form the ring structure with a ketone.

Wait, wait, wait! I'm getting a little confused. Let's try this differently. Let's think about the possible starting materials given in the options.

The options are all 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acids, differing in configuration (R and S). So each option has A and B as either R or S configurations.

So the starting materials are pentanoic acids with substituents.

Let me draw the structure of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. The pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, but with substituents. Wait, let's number them:

1  2 3 4 5

So position 3 is ethyl, position 5 has isobutoxy and oxo groups.

Wait, the structure would be:

CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-C(OCH(CH2)2CH3)-COOH ?

Wait, no. Wait, 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So the chain is five carbons, with the carboxylic acid at the end.

Wait, the structure would be:

CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-C(OCH(CH2)2CH3)-COOH ?

Wait, no. Let me think. Pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. So the positions are 1 (COOH), 2, 3, 4, 5.

So 3-ethyl: at position 3, an ethyl group.

5-isobutoxy: at position 5 (which is the first carbon from the COOH?), wait, no. Wait, wait, in pentanoic acid, the chain is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. So the carbons are numbered from the COOH end.

So position 1: COOH.

Position 2: CH2.

Position 3: CH2.

Position 4: CH2.

Position 5: CH3 (if it were pentanoic acid). So wait, the substituents are at position 3: ethyl; position 5: isobutoxy and oxo (keto group).

So the structure would be:

The acid is at position 1: COOH.

Position 2: CH2.

Position 3: C(ethyl)(something).

Wait, position 5 would be at the end beyond the COOH, but that's not possible. Wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The main chain is five carbons, with COOH at one end (carbon 1). Carbon 3 has an ethyl group, and carbon 5 (the last carbon) has an isobutoxy group and a ketone (oxo) group.

So the structure would be:

COOH - CH2 - C(ethyl)(something) - CH2 - C(OCH2CH(CH3)2).

Wait, but that would make the carbonyl group (oxo) at position 5, adjacent to the isobutoxy group. Hmm.

Wait, the groups at position 5 would be OCH(CH2CH3)2? Because isobutoxy is OCH(CH2CH3)2? Or maybe OCH(CH3)CH2?

Wait, isobutoxy is OCH(CH2CH3)2. Wait, isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2. So isobutoxy is OCH2CH(CH3)2?

Wait, maybe I'm getting tangled up in the structure, but the key point is that the starting materials are these pentanoic acid derivatives with a keto group at position 5 and isobutoxy at the same position.

Now, when LiBH4 or BH3 is used, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of the ester or some other group.

Wait, the starting materials are acids, but LiBH4 can't reduce carboxylic acids. So maybe the starting material is an ester, not a carboxylic acid. Oh wait, looking at the options, the starting materials are pentanoic acids, but perhaps in the reaction, they are esterified.

Wait, the product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester, a lactone. Let me think: when a lactone is treated with a reducing agent, it can open up. For example, gamma-butyrolactone when reduced would form a diol. But the product here is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps the lactone ring is five-membered or six-membered.

Wait, but the product is a six-membered ring (pyran). So maybe the starting material is a cyclic ester with a five-carbon chain, which upon reduction forms a six-membered ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material's ester group is adjacent to a ketone. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: when a ketone is treated with LiBH4, it would be reduced to a secondary alcohol. But the product is a ketone, so that can't be. So perhaps the starting material has a different functional group that upon reduction gives a ketone.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a nitrile. LiBH4 can reduce nitriles to amines, but that doesn't help here.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an ester, and the reduction leads to the formation of a diol, which then cyclizes to form the pyranone.

Wait, for example, suppose the starting material is a diester, and upon reduction, it forms a diol, which then cyclizes to form a ring with a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an alpha-keto ester. When reduced, it might form a secondary alcohol, but that doesn't lead to a ketone.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the diastereoselectivity of the reactions.

Wait, the product has an R configuration when treated with LiBH4 and an S configuration when treated with BH3. So the reagents are affecting the stereochemistry of the product.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has a chiral center that is being influenced by the reducing agent, leading to different configurations.

Wait, the starting materials are A and B, which are either R or S configurations, and after reduction, they produce (R) and (S) products, respectively.

So, the configuration of the starting material would determine the configuration of the product.

But how does the reducing agent affect that?

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on my reduction reactions. Let me think about the possible mechanisms.

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent and typically reduces carbonyl groups to their corresponding alcohols. It's a borohydride source, and the reaction is typically an SN2 mechanism, which can lead to inversion of configuration if the carbonyl is adjacent to a stereogenic center.

Wait, but in the product, we have a ketone. That doesn't fit because LiBH4 would reduce a ketone to a secondary alcohol. Hmm, unless the starting material is another functional group that upon reduction forms a ketone.

Wait, maybe the starting material is an ester, and the reduction forms a secondary alcohol, but then some elimination occurs to form a ketone. But that seems a bit involved.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal or acetal, which upon reduction gives the ketone.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone) with an alpha-keto group. For example, a gamma-lactone with a keto group. When reduced, the ester part becomes a diol, and the keto group remains, leading to a ring structure.

Wait, but I'm not quite sure. Let me try to imagine this.

Suppose the starting material is a gamma-lactone with a keto group. For example, something like:

O
||
O-C-O (lactone ring)

But that's too vague. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has an ester group and a carbonyl group, and upon reduction, the ester becomes a diol, and the carbonyl remains as a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a beta-keto ester. Beta-keto esters can undergo reduction, but LiBH4 can reduce them to secondary alcohols.

Wait, but if the starting material is a beta-keto ester, then LiBH4 would reduce the ester part to a diol, but I'm not sure how that would form a cyclic ketone.

Wait, perhaps the ester is part of a ring. So, for example, a five-membered ring ester. When reduced, the ester would open to form a diol, and the ring would adjust to form a six-membered ring with a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone, but that doesn't make sense because LiBH4 would reduce it to a secondary alcohol.

Wait, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the reaction conditions. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, while BH3 is a milder one. Wait, but BH3 is usually used for hydroboration, not for carbonyl reductions. Unless it's under specific conditions.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a ketone reduction. So, the starting material is a ketone, but that doesn't make sense because LiBH4 would reduce it to an alcohol.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone ester. For example, a gamma-keto ester in a five-membered ring. When LiBH4 reduces the ester part, it could form a diol, which then cyclizes to form a six-membered ring with a ketone.

Wait, let me imagine a gamma-keto ester:

O
||
O-C-O (ester group) connected in a ring.

Upon reduction with LiBH4, the ester would be reduced to a diol. So the ring would break, and the diol would form, perhaps leading to the formation of a new ring upon elimination or other reaction.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is formed via a Robinson annulation, but that's typically an oxidation step, not a reduction.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides that upon reduction form diols, which then cyclize to form the pyranone.

Wait, if the starting material is an epoxide with a substituent, then reducing it with LiBH4 or BH3 could form a diol, which could then cyclize with another part of the molecule to form the ring.

But I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, another angle: the product is a pyran-2-one. So, position 2 is the ketone. The ring is six-membered. So perhaps the starting material is a compound that can form this ring upon reduction.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diacid or a diester. Upon reduction, the ester groups are converted to alcohols, which then form the ring.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic acetal or ketal. Reduction would break the ring, but that doesn't seem to lead to the product.

At this point, I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the options provided.

The options are all A and B being the same or different, either R or S configurations. So the answer depends on the configuration changes during the reaction.

Wait, the product from A is (R) when using LiBH4, and the product from B is (S) when using BH3. So the configuration of the starting material and the reagents determine the product's configuration.

Wait, perhaps the starting material's configuration affects the product's configuration based on the reducing agent.

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that typically proceeds via an SN2 mechanism, leading to inversion of configuration if applicable. BH3, which I think is used in hydroboration reactions, is more about anti addition and can lead to different stereochemistry.

Wait, but BH3 is usually used for adding boron to alkenes, not for reducing ketones. Or maybe in some cases, it can reduce esters, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reactions involve the reduction of a carbonyl group to an alcohol, and the stereochemistry depends on the catalyst or the reducing agent.

Wait, but in that case, would LiBH4 and BH3 lead to different configurations?

Wait, I think that in ketone reductions, the stereochemistry isn't set because the carbonyl is planar. So the product would be a racemic mixture unless there's some chiral directing.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has a chiral center adjacent to the carbonyl, and the reduction leads to retention or inversion based on the reagent.

Wait, let's imagine the starting material has a carbonyl group adjacent to a chiral center. When reduced with LiBH4, which is a strong enough base and might proceed through an SN2 mechanism, the nucleophile (BH4-) would attack from the opposite side, leading to inversion of configuration.

Alternatively, if BH3 is used, perhaps it's a different mechanism, leading to retention.

Wait, but wait, BH3 isn't a strong enough base for typical SN2 reactions. Maybe it's more about other mechanisms, like conjugate additions or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material isn't a ketone but an ester. Let me think about the reduction of an ester to an alcohol. For example, when an ester is reduced with LiBH4, it typically forms a primary alcohol, but if it's an alpha-keto ester, reduction might form a secondary alcohol.

Wait, but in the product, we have a ketone, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ester, a lactone, with an adjacent carbonyl group. When LiBH4 is used, it reduces the ester to an alcohol, but the adjacent carbonyl remains.

Wait, but that would form a hemiacetal or something else, not a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an alpha-keto ester. So, something like:

RCO-COOR'

When reduced with LiBH4, maybe the ester part is reduced to an alcohol. But I'm not sure how that leads to a cyclic ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester with a carbonyl group, so that upon reduction, the ring opens and a new ring forms with a ketone.

I think I'm going in circles here. Maybe I should look at the options and see which ones make sense.

The options are:

A) Both A and B are (S)
B) Both A and B are (R)
C) A is (S), B is (R)
D) A is (R), B is (S)

The products are (R) and (S), respectively. So, when A is treated with LiBH4, it gives (R). When B is treated with BH3, it gives (S).

The starting materials are either R or S, so the configuration must change or stay the same based on the reagent.

If LiBH4 induces an inversion, then the starting material would have the opposite configuration. Similarly, BH3 might induce retention or a different effect.

Wait, if the reduction leads to inversion of configuration, then the starting material's configuration would be opposite to the product's.

So for reaction with LiBH4: product R is formed from A, which is perhaps S.

Similarly, for reaction with BH3: product S is formed from B, which is perhaps R.

So, looking at the options, this would correspond to option D: A is R, B is S.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure because I'm not certain about the mechanism's effect on configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration is retained. So if the product is R, the starting material would be R. But that doesn't fit because then A would be R, and B would be S to give S.

Wait, the options are:

If A is R and treated with LiBH4 gives R, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration depends on the reduction's mechanism.

Wait, let me think of a scenario where the starting material's configuration determines the product's configuration based on the reducing agent. For example, if LiBH4 causes inversion and BH3 causes retention.

So, for A, which uses LiBH4, the starting material would have the opposite configuration of the product. If the product is R, the starting material is S. For B, which uses BH3, if the reaction leads to retention, then the starting material would be S to give S product. Hmm, but that doesn't fit the options directly.

Wait, product when A is treated with LiBH4 is R. If LiBH4 causes inversion, then the starting material (A) is S configuration. For B, treated with BH3, product is S. If BH3 causes retention, then the starting material (B) is S. But looking at the options, that would mean option A is both S, which is option A.

But option A says A and B are both (S). Then, when A is treated with LiBH4, which causes inversion, the product would be R, which matches. When B is treated with BH3, which causes retention, the product would be S. That fits the scenario.

Wait, that makes sense. So if LiBH4 causes inversion of configuration and BH3 causes retention, then:

A is (S) → with LiBH4 → product is (R).

B is (S) → with BH3 → product is (S).

So that would correspond to option A.

But wait, looking at the options:

Option A: A and B are both (S).

So, in that case, both would give R and S products, respectively. Wait, no, when A is (S), LiBH4 would give R. When B is (S), BH3 would give S. But in the problem statement, B is treated with BH3 and gives S. So that fits.

Wait, but I thought LiBH4 causes inversion, so A (S) → R. And B (S) → S via BH3 (retention).

So the correct answer would be option A.

Alternatively, another possibility is that LiBH4 causes retention and BH3 causes inversion, leading to opposite configurations.

But I'm not entirely sure about the mechanism. I think LiBH4 reduction of a chiral ketone would lead to SN2-like attack, causing inversion. So, for example, if the starting material is a chiral ketone with R configuration, the reduction would give an alcohol with S configuration.

Wait, but the product here is a ketone, so maybe the starting material is an ester or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material isn't a ketone but has a chiral center that affects the reduction.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester with a chiral center, and the reducing agent affects the configuration of the resulting diol, which then forms the ring with the correct stereochemistry.

But I'm not exactly sure. However, given the options and the product configurations, if LiBH4 causes inversion and BH3 causes retention, then the starting materials would be S and S, leading to R and S products respectively.

So the correct option is A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the starting materials for two reactions that produce (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one using different reducing agents: LiBH4 and BH3. The starting materials are given as enantiomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, and the stereochemistry of the products depends on the reducing agent.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Reagents and Mechanisms**:
   - **LiBH4**: A strong reducing agent that typically proceeds via an SN2 mechanism, leading to inversion of configuration at a stereogenic center if present.
   - **BH3**: A milder reducing agent that may proceed via a different mechanism, potentially causing retention of configuration.

2. **Products and Stereochemistry**:
   - The product from reaction A (with LiBH4) is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.
   - The product from reaction B (with BH3) is (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.

3. **Starting Material Configurations**:
   - If LiBH4 causes inversion, the starting material (A) must have the opposite configuration of the product. Since the product is (R), the starting material (A) must be (S).
   - If BH3 causes retention, the starting material (B) must have the same configuration as the product. Since the product is (S), the starting material (B) must be (S).

4. **Matching with Options**:
   - Option A: Both A and B are (S). This matches the scenario where A (S) treated with LiBH4 gives (R), and B (S) treated with BH3 gives (S).
   - Other options do not align with the stereochemical outcomes of the reactions.

### Conclusion:
The correct starting materials are (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid for both reactions, as this configuration leads to the observed stereochemical outcomes when treated with LiBH4 and BH3.

Answer: A

Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question carefully.

The question says that a chemist performed two reactions using two different reducing agents on two unknown compounds, A and B. The products from both are given as (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, respectively. I need to determine the starting materials A and B from the given options.

Hmm, wait. So Reaction 1: A is treated with LiBH4 and H+ (probably an acid workup) to give (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Reaction 2: B is treated with BH3 and H+ to give (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.

Wait a second, I remember that LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, usually used for reducing esters, ketones, etc. But BH3 is often used in hydroboration reactions, which are different. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, I think I might be mixing things up. Let me think again. Oh, right! The reagents in these reactions might be for different types of reductions.

Wait, wait—I'm a bit confused. LiBH4 is a common reducing agent for carbonyl groups. BH3 is usually used for hydroboration, but in some cases, BH3 can be used as a reducing agent, perhaps in the presence of something else. Alternatively, maybe the conditions are different. Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the product is a ketone, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So the product is a cyclic ketone. Let me think about what kind of starting material would form this upon reduction.

Wait, if the product is a ketone, then perhaps the starting material was an ester or a carbonyl compound. Wait, but in the product, the ketone is at position 2 of the pyran ring. So the starting material would probably have a carbonyl group that, upon reduction, gives the ketone. Or wait, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ester, like a lactone, and upon reduction, it opens up?

Wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ketones with some protecting groups. Wait, not sure.

Wait, another approach: maybe the starting materials are epoxides? No, because reducing an epoxide would not form a ketone. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are lactones. Because when a lactone is reduced, it can form a diol, but I'm not sure how that would lead to a ketone.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reagents and what they do. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. It can reduce esters to alcohols. Wait, but in the product, we have a ketone. Hmm, so maybe the starting material for A is a ketone, and LiBH4 does something else? No, LiBH4 is more for reducing esters, amides, ketones, etc. Wait, LiBH4 can reduce esters to alcohols, but then that would form a secondary alcohol. But the product here is a ketone. That doesn't add up.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an acid derivative, like an acyl chloride or an ester. But how does that form a ketone upon reduction?

Wait, maybe the starting materials are cyclic esters, like lactones. Let's say the lactone is, for example, a gamma or delta lactone. When reduced, it could open up. But wait, no, because LiBH4 usually reduces esters (like lactones) to diols.

Wait, perhaps it's a different scenario. Maybe the starting materials are carbonyl-containing compounds, and the reduction leads to a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are ketals or acetals, and upon reduction, they form alcohols or other structures.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the stereochemistry. The products are (R) and (S) configurations. So the starting materials must have had some stereogenic centers that influence the outcome.

Wait, another thought: the product is a tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The structure of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one would be a six-membered ring (pyran), with a ketone at position 2 and an ethyl group at position 4. So the ring is a tetrahydropyran with the substituents.

Wait, I think that pyranone structures can be formed via a Robinson annulation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diacid or something that can cyclize into a pyran ring upon reduction.

Alternatively, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the reagents again. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically used for ketones, aldehydes, esters, etc. BH3 is used in hydroboration reactions, which are for adding boron to alkenes. But wait, BH3 can also be used as a reducing agent in some cases, perhaps for epoxides or other groups.

Wait, wait! Perhaps the starting materials are epoxides. Because when an epoxide is treated with a borane reagent, it can open, but that usually involves some acid catalysis. But BH3 is a Lewis acid, so maybe it's used in opening epoxides. Hmm.

Alternatively, another possibility: the starting materials are cyclic ethers with ketone groups. No, that might not fit.

Another approach: perhaps the starting materials are ketones themselves. But if so, reducing them with LiBH4 would give secondary alcohols, not ketones. So that doesn't fit the product.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are ketals. Let's say, a ketal derived from a ketone. When you reduce a ketal, you might get an alcohol. But that doesn't lead to a ketone itself.

Hmm. Maybe the starting materials are esters, and when reduced, they form alcohols. But the product is a ketone, so that might not fit.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are alpha-hydroxy esters. Because LiBH4 can reduce esters, but I'm not sure how that would lead to a ketone.

Alternatively, I'm missing something about the reagents. Let me think: LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, but BH3 is typically used in hydroboration reactions, which are for adding boron to alkenes. But BH3 can be used under certain conditions to reduce carbonyl groups as well. Wait, for example, BH3 is sometimes used in the reduction of esters to alcohols under specific conditions. Or maybe in the presence of a co-reagent.

Alternatively, perhaps the reactions involve the reduction of epoxides. Wait, when an epoxide is treated with LiBH4 or BH3, does it open up to form an alcohol?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, so perhaps I should think about what the product is and work backward. The product is (R) or (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let me imagine its structure. It's a six-membered ring, with oxygen at position 5 (since it's a pyran), with a ketone at position 2 and an ethyl group at position 4.

Wait, the positions are a bit tricky, but perhaps the ring is formed from a diol and a ketone. Alternatively, maybe the pyranone is formed via a ring-forming process.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the starting materials are esters of some sort, and upon reduction, they form the pyranone. For example, maybe they're cyclic esters (lactones) that, when reduced, form the ring structure with a ketone.

Wait, wait, wait! I'm getting a little confused. Let's try this differently. Let's think about the possible starting materials given in the options.

The options are all 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acids, differing in configuration (R and S). So each option has A and B as either R or S configurations.

So the starting materials are pentanoic acids with substituents.

Let me draw the structure of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. The pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, but with substituents. Wait, let's number them:

1  2 3 4 5

So position 3 is ethyl, position 5 has isobutoxy and oxo groups.

Wait, the structure would be:

CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-C(OCH(CH2)2CH3)-COOH ?

Wait, no. Wait, 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So the chain is five carbons, with the carboxylic acid at the end.

Wait, the structure would be:

CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-C(OCH(CH2)2CH3)-COOH ?

Wait, no. Let me think. Pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. So the positions are 1 (COOH), 2, 3, 4, 5.

So 3-ethyl: at position 3, an ethyl group.

5-isobutoxy: at position 5 (which is the first carbon from the COOH?), wait, no. Wait, wait, in pentanoic acid, the chain is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. So the carbons are numbered from the COOH end.

So position 1: COOH.

Position 2: CH2.

Position 3: CH2.

Position 4: CH2.

Position 5: CH3 (if it were pentanoic acid). So wait, the substituents are at position 3: ethyl; position 5: isobutoxy and oxo (keto group).

So the structure would be:

The acid is at position 1: COOH.

Position 2: CH2.

Position 3: C(ethyl)(something).

Wait, position 5 would be at the end beyond the COOH, but that's not possible. Wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The main chain is five carbons, with COOH at one end (carbon 1). Carbon 3 has an ethyl group, and carbon 5 (the last carbon) has an isobutoxy group and a ketone (oxo) group.

So the structure would be:

COOH - CH2 - C(ethyl)(something) - CH2 - C(OCH2CH(CH3)2).

Wait, but that would make the carbonyl group (oxo) at position 5, adjacent to the isobutoxy group. Hmm.

Wait, the groups at position 5 would be OCH(CH2CH3)2? Because isobutoxy is OCH(CH2CH3)2? Or maybe OCH(CH3)CH2?

Wait, isobutoxy is OCH(CH2CH3)2. Wait, isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2. So isobutoxy is OCH2CH(CH3)2?

Wait, maybe I'm getting tangled up in the structure, but the key point is that the starting materials are these pentanoic acid derivatives with a keto group at position 5 and isobutoxy at the same position.

Now, when LiBH4 or BH3 is used, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of the ester or some other group.

Wait, the starting materials are acids, but LiBH4 can't reduce carboxylic acids. So maybe the starting material is an ester, not a carboxylic acid. Oh wait, looking at the options, the starting materials are pentanoic acids, but perhaps in the reaction, they are esterified.

Wait, the product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester, a lactone. Let me think: when a lactone is treated with a reducing agent, it can open up. For example, gamma-butyrolactone when reduced would form a diol. But the product here is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps the lactone ring is five-membered or six-membered.

Wait, but the product is a six-membered ring (pyran). So maybe the starting material is a cyclic ester with a five-carbon chain, which upon reduction forms a six-membered ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material's ester group is adjacent to a ketone. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: when a ketone is treated with LiBH4, it would be reduced to a secondary alcohol. But the product is a ketone, so that can't be. So perhaps the starting material has a different functional group that upon reduction gives a ketone.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a nitrile. LiBH4 can reduce nitriles to amines, but that doesn't help here.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an ester, and the reduction leads to the formation of a diol, which then cyclizes to form the pyranone.

Wait, for example, suppose the starting material is a diester, and upon reduction, it forms a diol, which then cyclizes to form a ring with a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an alpha-keto ester. When reduced, it might form a secondary alcohol, but that doesn't lead to a ketone.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the diastereoselectivity of the reactions.

Wait, the product has an R configuration when treated with LiBH4 and an S configuration when treated with BH3. So the reagents are affecting the stereochemistry of the product.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has a chiral center that is being influenced by the reducing agent, leading to different configurations.

Wait, the starting materials are A and B, which are either R or S configurations, and after reduction, they produce (R) and (S) products, respectively.

So, the configuration of the starting material would determine the configuration of the product.

But how does the reducing agent affect that?

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on my reduction reactions. Let me think about the possible mechanisms.

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent and typically reduces carbonyl groups to their corresponding alcohols. It's a borohydride source, and the reaction is typically an SN2 mechanism, which can lead to inversion of configuration if the carbonyl is adjacent to a stereogenic center.

Wait, but in the product, we have a ketone. That doesn't fit because LiBH4 would reduce a ketone to a secondary alcohol. Hmm, unless the starting material is another functional group that upon reduction forms a ketone.

Wait, maybe the starting material is an ester, and the reduction forms a secondary alcohol, but then some elimination occurs to form a ketone. But that seems a bit involved.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal or acetal, which upon reduction gives the ketone.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone) with an alpha-keto group. For example, a gamma-lactone with a keto group. When reduced, the ester part becomes a diol, and the keto group remains, leading to a ring structure.

Wait, but I'm not quite sure. Let me try to imagine this.

Suppose the starting material is a gamma-lactone with a keto group. For example, something like:

O
||
O-C-O (lactone ring)

But that's too vague. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has an ester group and a carbonyl group, and upon reduction, the ester becomes a diol, and the carbonyl remains as a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a beta-keto ester. Beta-keto esters can undergo reduction, but LiBH4 can reduce them to secondary alcohols.

Wait, but if the starting material is a beta-keto ester, then LiBH4 would reduce the ester part to a diol, but I'm not sure how that would form a cyclic ketone.

Wait, perhaps the ester is part of a ring. So, for example, a five-membered ring ester. When reduced, the ester would open to form a diol, and the ring would adjust to form a six-membered ring with a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone, but that doesn't make sense because LiBH4 would reduce it to a secondary alcohol.

Wait, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the reaction conditions. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, while BH3 is a milder one. Wait, but BH3 is usually used for hydroboration, not for carbonyl reductions. Unless it's under specific conditions.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a ketone reduction. So, the starting material is a ketone, but that doesn't make sense because LiBH4 would reduce it to an alcohol.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone ester. For example, a gamma-keto ester in a five-membered ring. When LiBH4 reduces the ester part, it could form a diol, which then cyclizes to form a six-membered ring with a ketone.

Wait, let me imagine a gamma-keto ester:

O
||
O-C-O (ester group) connected in a ring.

Upon reduction with LiBH4, the ester would be reduced to a diol. So the ring would break, and the diol would form, perhaps leading to the formation of a new ring upon elimination or other reaction.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is formed via a Robinson annulation, but that's typically an oxidation step, not a reduction.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides that upon reduction form diols, which then cyclize to form the pyranone.

Wait, if the starting material is an epoxide with a substituent, then reducing it with LiBH4 or BH3 could form a diol, which could then cyclize with another part of the molecule to form the ring.

But I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, another angle: the product is a pyran-2-one. So, position 2 is the ketone. The ring is six-membered. So perhaps the starting material is a compound that can form this ring upon reduction.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diacid or a diester. Upon reduction, the ester groups are converted to alcohols, which then form the ring.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic acetal or ketal. Reduction would break the ring, but that doesn't seem to lead to the product.

At this point, I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the options provided.

The options are all A and B being the same or different, either R or S configurations. So the answer depends on the configuration changes during the reaction.

Wait, the product from A is (R) when using LiBH4, and the product from B is (S) when using BH3. So the configuration of the starting material and the reagents determine the product's configuration.

Wait, perhaps the starting material's configuration affects the product's configuration based on the reducing agent.

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that typically proceeds via an SN2 mechanism, leading to inversion of configuration if applicable. BH3, which I think is used in hydroboration reactions, is more about anti addition and can lead to different stereochemistry.

Wait, but BH3 is usually used for adding boron to alkenes, not for reducing ketones. Or maybe in some cases, it can reduce esters, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reactions involve the reduction of a carbonyl group to an alcohol, and the stereochemistry depends on the catalyst or the reducing agent.

Wait, but in that case, would LiBH4 and BH3 lead to different configurations?

Wait, I think that in ketone reductions, the stereochemistry isn't set because the carbonyl is planar. So the product would be a racemic mixture unless there's some chiral directing.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has a chiral center adjacent to the carbonyl, and the reduction leads to retention or inversion based on the reagent.

Wait, let's imagine the starting material has a carbonyl group adjacent to a chiral center. When reduced with LiBH4, which is a strong enough base and might proceed through an SN2 mechanism, the nucleophile (BH4-) would attack from the opposite side, leading to inversion of configuration.

Alternatively, if BH3 is used, perhaps it's a different mechanism, leading to retention.

Wait, but wait, BH3 isn't a strong enough base for typical SN2 reactions. Maybe it's more about other mechanisms, like conjugate additions or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material isn't a ketone but an ester. Let me think about the reduction of an ester to an alcohol. For example, when an ester is reduced with LiBH4, it typically forms a primary alcohol, but if it's an alpha-keto ester, reduction might form a secondary alcohol.

Wait, but in the product, we have a ketone, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ester, a lactone, with an adjacent carbonyl group. When LiBH4 is used, it reduces the ester to an alcohol, but the adjacent carbonyl remains.

Wait, but that would form a hemiacetal or something else, not a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an alpha-keto ester. So, something like:

RCO-COOR'

When reduced with LiBH4, maybe the ester part is reduced to an alcohol. But I'm not sure how that leads to a cyclic ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester with a carbonyl group, so that upon reduction, the ring opens and a new ring forms with a ketone.

I think I'm going in circles here. Maybe I should look at the options and see which ones make sense.

The options are:

A) Both A and B are (S)
B) Both A and B are (R)
C) A is (S), B is (R)
D) A is (R), B is (S)

The products are (R) and (S), respectively. So, when A is treated with LiBH4, it gives (R). When B is treated with BH3, it gives (S).

The starting materials are either R or S, so the configuration must change or stay the same based on the reagent.

If LiBH4 induces an inversion, then the starting material would have the opposite configuration. Similarly, BH3 might induce retention or a different effect.

Wait, if the reduction leads to inversion of configuration, then the starting material's configuration would be opposite to the product's.

So for reaction with LiBH4: product R is formed from A, which is perhaps S.

Similarly, for reaction with BH3: product S is formed from B, which is perhaps R.

So, looking at the options, this would correspond to option D: A is R, B is S.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure because I'm not certain about the mechanism's effect on configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration is retained. So if the product is R, the starting material would be R. But that doesn't fit because then A would be R, and B would be S to give S.

Wait, the options are:

If A is R and treated with LiBH4 gives R, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration depends on the reduction's mechanism.

Wait, let me think of a scenario where the starting material's configuration determines the product's configuration based on the reducing agent. For example, if LiBH4 causes inversion and BH3 causes retention.

So, for A, which uses LiBH4, the starting material would have the opposite configuration of the product. If the product is R, the starting material is S. For B, which uses BH3, if the reaction leads to retention, then the starting material would be S to give S product. Hmm, but that doesn't fit the options directly.

Wait, product when A is treated with LiBH4 is R. If LiBH4 causes inversion, then the starting material (A) is S configuration. For B, treated with BH3, product is S. If BH3 causes retention, then the starting material (B) is S. But looking at the options, that would mean option A is both S, which is option A.

But option A says A and B are both (S). Then, when A is treated with LiBH4, which causes inversion, the product would be R, which matches. When B is treated with BH3, which causes retention, the product would be S. That fits the scenario.

Wait, that makes sense. So if LiBH4 causes inversion of configuration and BH3 causes retention, then:

A is (S) → with LiBH4 → product is (R).

B is (S) → with BH3 → product is (S).

So that would correspond to option A.

But wait, looking at the options:

Option A: A and B are both (S).

So, in that case, both would give R and S products, respectively. Wait, no, when A is (S), LiBH4 would give R. When B is (S), BH3 would give S. But in the problem statement, B is treated with BH3 and gives S. So that fits.

Wait, but I thought LiBH4 causes inversion, so A (S) → R. And B (S) → S via BH3 (retention).

So the correct answer would be option A.

Alternatively, another possibility is that LiBH4 causes retention and BH3 causes inversion, leading to opposite configurations.

But I'm not entirely sure about the mechanism. I think LiBH4 reduction of a chiral ketone would lead to SN2-like attack, causing inversion. So, for example, if the starting material is a chiral ketone with R configuration, the reduction would give an alcohol with S configuration.

Wait, but the product here is a ketone, so maybe the starting material is an ester or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material isn't a ketone but has a chiral center that affects the reduction.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester with a chiral center, and the reducing agent affects the configuration of the resulting diol, which then forms the ring with the correct stereochemistry.

But I'm not exactly sure. However, given the options and the product configurations, if LiBH4 causes inversion and BH3 causes retention, then the starting materials would be S and S, leading to R and S products respectively.

So the correct option is A.


The question involves determining the starting materials for two reactions that produce (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one using different reducing agents: LiBH4 and BH3. The starting materials are given as enantiomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, and the stereochemistry of the products depends on the reducing agent.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Reagents and Mechanisms**:
   - **LiBH4**: A strong reducing agent that typically proceeds via an SN2 mechanism, leading to inversion of configuration at a stereogenic center if present.
   - **BH3**: A milder reducing agent that may proceed via a different mechanism, potentially causing retention of configuration.

2. **Products and Stereochemistry**:
   - The product from reaction A (with LiBH4) is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.
   - The product from reaction B (with BH3) is (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.

3. **Starting Material Configurations**:
   - If LiBH4 causes inversion, the starting material (A) must have the opposite configuration of the product. Since the product is (R), the starting material (A) must be (S).
   - If BH3 causes retention, the starting material (B) must have the same configuration as the product. Since the product is (S), the starting material (B) must be (S).

4. **Matching with Options**:
   - Option A: Both A and B are (S). This matches the scenario where A (S) treated with LiBH4 gives (R), and B (S) treated with BH3 gives (S).
   - Other options do not align with the stereochemical outcomes of the reactions.

### Conclusion:
The correct starting materials are (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid for both reactions, as this configuration leads to the observed stereochemical outcomes when treated with LiBH4 and BH3.

Answer: A
