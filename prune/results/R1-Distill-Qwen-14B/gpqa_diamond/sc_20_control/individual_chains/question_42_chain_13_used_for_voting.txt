Okay, so I have this astronomy problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, there are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They have circular orbits and were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for Transit Timing Variation. But I don't think that part is super relevant to the question. The important stuff is about their equilibrium temperatures and masses, and from that, I need to find out how much larger the orbital period of Planet3 is compared to Planet1.

Hmm. The given data: the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4. So, T2/T1 ≈1.4. Similarly, T3/T2 is about 2.3, so T3/T2≈2.3. That means T3 is 2.3 times T2, and since T2 is 1.4 times T1, T3 is 1.4 *2.3 = 3.22 times T1. So T3 is about 3.22 times hotter than Planet1.

Then the mass ratios: Planet1 and Planet2 have a mass ratio of about 1.15. So M2/M1≈1.15. And M3/M2 is 1.35, so M3 is 1.35 times M2. So M3 = 1.35 * M2, and since M2 is 1.15 * M1, M3 is 1.35 *1.15 * M1 = approximately 1.5525 M1. So Planet3 is about 1.55 times as massive as Planet1.

The albedo for all three is 0.3, same as Earth. Albedo affects the equilibrium temperature because it determines how much light is reflected. The formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T = [ (L (1 - a))/(16 π σ D²) ) ]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is albedo, and D is the distance from the star.

Wait, but all the planets are around the same star, right? Because when we talk about exoplanets, each is in its own system, but I think in this case, since it's a system of three, they all orbit the same star. So L is the same for all three. So the equilibrium temperature ratio between them depends on the square root of their orbital distances.

Wait, let me get the formula right. The equilibrium temperature T is proportional to [ (L (1 - a)) / D² ]^(1/4). Since L and a are the same for all, T is proportional to D^(-1/2). So if T increases, D decreases. Because as you get closer to the star, the temperature goes up.

So for the ratio T1 / T2 = 1.4. So since T is inversely proportional to D^0.5, the ratio T1/T2 = (D2/D1)^(0.5). Because T ∝ 1/sqrt(D), so T1 = sqrt(L/(16πσ D1²)) ... but perhaps a better way is to write the ratio.

Wait, let me write the formula correctly. The equilibrium temperature T is given by:

T = [ ( L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ D²) ]^(1/4 )

So, T proportional to sqrt( (1 - a) / D² )^ (1/2 ), but wait, no. Let me square both sides:

T^4 is proportional to (1 - a) / D² → T^4 ∝ (1/D²) → T ∝ 1 / D^(1/2)

So T is proportional to 1 / sqrt(D). So, T1 / T2 = sqrt( D2 / D1 )

Because T1 = k / sqrt(D1), T2 = k / sqrt(D2), so T1/T2 = sqrt(D2/D1). So if T1/T2 is 1.4, then sqrt(D2/D1) = 1.4 → D2/D1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So D2 = 1.96 * D1. So Planet2 is farther from the star than Planet1. Because a higher T means closer in, right? So if Planet2 is hotter than Planet1, it's closer. Wait, wait, wait—no. Wait, wait a minute, no! Wait, equilibrium temperature depends on distance. If a planet is closer, T is higher. So if Planet2 has a higher equilibrium temperature than Planet1, Planet2 must be closer to the star. So D2 < D1. Wait, but according to the ratio above, we have D2/D1 = (T1/T2)^2. Wait, no:

Wait, T1 is Planet1's temperature. Let me see. Correct the ratio: T1 = (L (1 - a)/(16 π σ D1² ))^(1/4 )

T2 = (L (1 - a)/(16 π σ D2² ))^(1/4 )

So the ratio T2 / T1 is equal to [ (D1²) / (D2²) ]^(1/4 )

Because if you take T2 / T1 = ( ( (1-a)/L etc. )^(1/4 ) for D2 over D1.

So T2/T1 = ( D1² / D2² )^(1/4 ) = (D1/D2 )^(1/2 )

Because (D1^2 / D2^2) is (D1/D2)^2. So taking the 1/4 power, that becomes (D1/D2)^(1/2).

So, T2/T1 = sqrt( D1/D2 )

So if T2/T1 is 1.4, then sqrt(D1/D2) =1.4 → D1/D2 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96 → D2 = D1 / 1.96 → D2 ≈ 0.51 D1.

So Planet2 is about half the distance of Planet1 from the star. So D2 is closer.

Similarly, for Planet3 and Planet2: T3/T2 = 2.3, so T3 =2.3 * T2.

Using the same ratio:

T3 / T2 = sqrt( D2 / D3 ) → 2.3 = sqrt( D2/D3 )

Squaring both sides: 2.3^2 = (D2/D3) → 5.29 = D2/D3 → D3 = D2 /5.29.

Since D2 is 0.51 D1, D3 = (0.51 D1) / 5.29 ≈ 0.51 /5.29 D1 ≈ 0.0964 D1.

So Planet3 is about 0.0964 times the orbital distance of Planet1. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait. Let me double-check.

Wait, no. Because if T3 is larger than T2, then Planet3 must be closer to the star than Planet2. So D3 is less than D2.

Wait, so:

From T3 / T2 = 2.3, using the same formula:

T3 = (L (1 - a)/(16 π σ D3² ))^(1/4 )

T2 = same with D2.

So T3 / T2 = sqrt( D2 / D3 )

So 2.3 = sqrt( D2/D3 ) → D2/D3 = 5.29 → D3 = D2 /5.29.

Since D2 is already 0.51 D1, D3 = 0.51 D1 /5.29 ≈ 0.0964 D1.

So the distances are: D1 (Planet1), D2 = 0.51 D1, D3=0.0964 D1.

Wait, but that would mean Planet3 is much closer than Planet1. Hmm, but let's remember that orbital period is related to the distance via Kepler's third law.

Kepler's third law says that (D^3)/(P^2) = (G M_total) / (4 π² ), where M_total is the mass of the star plus the planets. But in most cases, the star's mass is way larger than the planets, so we can approximate M_total as just the star's mass, M*. So for each planet, we can write:

P^2 = (4 π² D^3 )/( G M* )

But wait, in reality, each planet's orbit is around the same star, so M* is the same. So for each planet, P is proportional to D^(3/2 ) / sqrt(M* )

But if we take the ratio of periods, say P3/P1, since M* is the same, it's ( D3^(3/2) ) / ( D1^(3/2) ) ) → (D3/D1 )^(3/2 )

So P3/P1 = ( D3 / D1 )^(3/2 )

We already have D3 = 0.0964 D1.

So D3/D1 = 0.0964.

So (0.0964)^(3/2 ) → Let's calculate that.

First, sqrt(0.0964 ) is approximately 0.3105. Then, 0.3105^3 is about 0.0298.

So P3/P1 ≈ 0.0298. Wait, that would mean P3 is much smaller than P1, but that's not possible because Planet3 is much closer to the star, so it should have a much shorter orbital period, right? Wait, but the question is asking by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1. So if P3 is smaller than P1, the factor would be less than 1. But that's not any of the answer options. All the options are greater than 1.

Wait, did I get something wrong? Let me double-check.

Wait, the equilibrium temperature of Planet3 is higher than Planet2, which in turn is higher than Planet1. So Planet3 is the closest, then Planet2, then Planet1 is the farthest. So P3 < P2 < P1. So the orbital period of Planet3 is shorter than Planet1's. So P3/P1 would be less than 1, meaning Planet3's period is smaller, but the question is asking by what factor is Planet3's period larger than Planet1's. So that would be a factor less than 1. But all the options are like 3.2, 10, etc. So that seems conflicting.

Hmm, perhaps I made an error in the way I applied the ratios.

Wait, going back. The equilibrium temperatures are given as Planet1 and Planet2 as ratio 1.4. So T2 is 1.4 times T1? Or is it T1 over T2?

Wait, the question says: "the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4."

Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Does it mean T1/T2 =1.4 or T2/T1=1.4?

Wait, in the problem statement: "the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4." So it's T1 : T2 =1.4. Which would mean T1 is larger than T2 by a factor of 1.4. But that would imply Planet1 is hotter than Planet2, which, if they are around the same star, would mean Planet1 is closer. But earlier, when I calculated, I assumed T2 is larger than T1, but perhaps that's the mistake.

Wait, if T1 is hotter than T2, that would mean Planet1 is closer to the star, so D1 < D2. So let's redo the ratios correctly.

Let me restate the given ratios.

Problem says:

Ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approx 1.4. So it could be T1/T2=1.4 or T2/T1=1.4. Hmm. The way the question is phrased, it's not clear. But in the context of exoplanets, I think that the ratio is T1 over T2. So perhaps T1 is hotter than T2, meaning D1 is less than D2. So Planet1 is closer, hotter.

So let's recompute.

So if T1/T2 =1.4, then T2 = T1 /1.4.

But wait, equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance. So when T1 is higher than T2, that would mean D1 is less than D2.

Yes, so T1 is higher → Planet1 is closer to the star.

So let's correctly compute the distance ratios.

Given that, T1 / T2 =1.4 → T1 =1.4 T2.

But since T is proportional to 1/sqrt(D), we have:

T1 / T2 = sqrt( D2 / D1 )

So 1.4 = sqrt( D2/D1 )

Squaring both sides: 1.96 = D2/D1 → D2 = 1.96 D1.

So Planet2 is further from the star than Planet1.

Similarly, T3/T2 is about 2.3 → T3=2.3 T2.

So T3/T2 = sqrt( D2/D3 )

2.3 = sqrt( D2/D3 )

Squaring: 5.29 = D2/D3 → D3 = D2 /5.29.

Since D2 is 1.96 D1, D3= (1.96 D1)/5.29 ≈ 0.37 D1.

So Planet3 is at about 0.37 times the distance of Planet1 from the star.

So now, the distances are: Planet1 at D1, Planet2 at 1.96 D1, Planet3 at 0.37 D1.

So to find the orbital periods, we use Kepler's third law.

But wait, each planet is orbiting the same star, so M* is constant. So for each planet, P² = (4 π² D³)/( G M* )

So the ratio of periods between two planets is (D2³ / D1³ )^(1/2 ), because P² is proportional to D³.

So P3 / P1 = sqrt( (D3³) / (D1³) ) ) = ( D3 / D1 )^(3/2 )

We have D3/D1 = 0.37. So 0.37^(3/2 ) → let's compute that.

First, take the square root of 0.37: sqrt(0.37) ≈ 0.608.

Then, cube that: 0.608^3 ≈ 0.608 *0.608=0.369; 0.369 *0.608≈0.224.

So P3/P1 = 0.224. So Planet3's period is about 0.224 times that of Planet1. But the question is asking by what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1. That would be 1/0.224 ≈4.46. So about 4.4 times larger. So the answer would be option C) ~4.4.

Wait, but earlier I thought that Planet3 was further away, but no, according to this, Planet3 is closer. So D3 is smaller than D1, so P3 is smaller. But according to this calculation, P3 is 0.224 P1, so the period of Planet3 is smaller than Planet1. But the question is, "By what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1?" So if P3 is smaller, it's a factor less than 1. But that's not matching any of the options. Wait, but I must have made a mistake.

Wait, no, no, wait. Wait, no. Let's get this straight. If Planet3 has a much shorter orbital period than Planet1, then P3 is less than P1. So the factor would be less than 1. But the options are all greater than 1. So I must have messed up the ratio.

Wait, perhaps I reversed the ratio. Let me re-examine.

Wait, the question asks, "By what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1?"

So the factor is P3 / P1.

If P3 is larger, the factor is greater than 1. If smaller, it's less than 1.

In our current calculation, P3 is 0.224 times P1. So the factor is 0.224, which is less than 1. But the options given are all greater than 1. So something is wrong here.

Ah, wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of P3/P1. Let me think again.

Wait, I have D3 = 0.37 D1.

So P3² ∝ D3³ → P3² = (0.37 D1 )³ → P3² = 0.37³ D1³.

Similarly, P1² ∝ D1³ → P1² = D1³.

So the ratio (P3²)/(P1²) = (0.37^3 D1^3 )/( D1^3 ) )= 0.37^3.

So P3/P1 = sqrt(0.37^3 ) = 0.37^(3/2 )

Which is what I did earlier, leading to 0.224.

So that would make P3 less than P1. So the factor is 0.224, meaning Planet3's period is about a fifth of Planet1's. So the question is, why are the options all larger than 1? Did I perhaps mix up the ratios?

Wait, perhaps I should reverse the ratio. Maybe I need to compute P1/P3, which would be 1/0.224≈4.46. So that would make P1's period about 4.46 times longer than Planet3's. But the question is, which way around? The question is, how much larger is P3 than P1. So in that case, if P3 is smaller, it's not larger. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, another possibility is that I messed up the equilibrium temperature ratio. Let me re-express the equilibrium temperature formula correctly.

Equilibrium temperature T = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ D²) ]^(1/4 )

So, T is proportional to (1/D)^(1/2 ), because when you take D squared in the denominator, the square root gives D^(-1/2 ).

So, T ∝ 1 / sqrt(D).

So if T increases, D decreases.

So, given that, if Planet3 has a higher equilibrium temperature than Planet2, it must be closer to the star than Planet2, which is closer than Planet1.

Wait, no. Wait, the given T ratios are:

Planet1 and Planet2: T1/T2=1.4 → so T1 is larger, so D1 < D2.

Planet2 and Planet3: T3/T2=2.3 → T3 is larger, so D3 < D2.

So distances: D3 < D2 < D1.

So Planet3 is closest to the star, then Planet2, then Planet1 is farthest.

So, in terms of orbital periods, the period increases as the distance increases.

So if Planet3 is closest, its period is the shortest, Planet1 is farthest, period is longest.

But the question is, by what factor is Planet3's period larger than Planet1's. So Planet3's period is smaller, so the factor would be less than 1. But all answer options are >1, so something's wrong.

Wait, perhaps the mass ratios are affecting the calculation. Because the period depends on the mass of the star and the planet. Wait, but in the Kepler's third law, when considering a planet orbiting a star, the period depends on the mass of the star and the semi-major axis. Since all the planets are orbiting the same star, the mass of the star is same for all. So the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star. So the mass of the planet doesn't significantly affect the period.

Thus, the period ratio depends only on the cube of the distance.

Wait, but let me make sure. The exact form of Kepler's third law is P² = (4 π² / (G M* )) * a³.

So M* is the mass of the star. So if M* is the same for all planets, the period only depends on a (distance). So the mass of the planet doesn't matter in the law when the star is much more massive.

Thus, the masses given in the problem (Planet1, Planet2, Planet3 masses) might not affect the orbital period calculation. So perhaps the mass data is a red herring, or used for another part of the problem that's not relevant here.

But wait, why is the mass ratio given? Because the question is about the orbital period. Hmm. Unless, considering the TTV method, the mass of the planet affects the timing of transits, but in this question, the orbital period is being asked, which is a function of the distance and the star's mass.

So perhaps I should ignore the mass ratios for the purpose of calculating the periods. Because the period depends on the star's mass and the planet's distance.

So, back to the problem. So, the periods are determined by the distances. So, from the equilibrium temperature ratios, we can get the distance ratios. Then, using Kepler's law, find the period ratios.

So, to recap:

Given:

T1/T2 =1.4 → T1=1.4 T2.

Since T ∝ 1/sqrt(D), T1=1.4 T2 → 1/sqrt(D1) =1.4 / sqrt(D2 )

Wait, no. Let me express the ratio correctly.

T1 / T2 = sqrt( D2 / D1 )

So 1.4 = sqrt(D2/D1) → D2/D1 = (1.4)^2 =1.96 → D2=1.96 D1.

Similarly, T3/T2=2.3 → sqrt(D2/D3 )=2.3 → D2/D3=5.29 → D3= D2/5.29.

Since D2 is 1.96 D1, D3=1.96 D1 /5.29 ≈ 0.37 D1.

So D3=0.37 D1.

So, the periods are proportional to D^(3/2 )

So, P3/P1 = (D3/D1 )^(3/2 ) = (0.37)^(3/2 )

Compute 0.37^1.5:

0.37^0.5 ≈ 0.608.

0.608 *0.37 ≈ 0.225.

So P3/P1 ≈ 0.225.

So, the period of Planet3 is approx 0.225 times that of Planet1. So, the period of Planet3 is about 22.5% of Planet1's. So, the factor by which Planet3's period is larger than Planet1's is 0.225, which is less than 1. But the options are all greater than 1.

So, I must have made a mistake in the setup. Alternatively, perhaps the temperature ratios are T2/T1=1.4, not T1/T2=1.4.

Let me try that.

If T2/T1=1.4, then:

T2 =1.4 T1.

Since T ∝ 1/sqrt(D), T2 =1.4 T1 → 1/sqrt(D2) =1.4 / sqrt(D1 )

Which gives sqrt(D1/D2 )=1.4 → D1/D2=1.96 → D2 = D1/1.96 ≈0.51 D1.

Similarly, T3/T2=2.3 → T3=2.3 T2.

So, 1/sqrt(D3) =2.3 / sqrt(D2 )

So sqrt(D2/D3 )=2.3 → D2/D3= (2.3)^2=5.29 → D3= D2/5.29.

Since D2=0.51 D1, D3=0.51 D1 /5.29 ≈0.0964 D1.

So D3 is about 0.0964 D1.

Now, the periods are proportional to D^(3/2).

So, P3/P1 = (D3/D1 )^(3/2 ) → (0.0964 )^1.5 = ?

Compute 0.0964^0.5: sqrt(0.0964)= approx 0.3105.

Then, 0.3105 *0.0964 ≈ 0.0298.

So, P3 is about 0.0298 times P1 → P3 = 0.0298 P1 → so the factor is 0.0298, which is even smaller, but that's not matching any options either.

Hmm, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should approach this differently.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the orbital periods, and the data given includes the masses, but I wasn't considering them. But earlier, I thought the mass of the planet doesn't affect the period. Or does it?

Wait, wait, in reality, for a planet's orbital period, the mass of the planet is negligible compared to the star's mass, so the period depends only on the star's mass and the distance. So the planet's mass doesn't play a role.

So the mass ratios given in the problem are probably irrelevant to the orbital period calculation. So perhaps I should ignore the mass data.

Wait, but the question is about the orbital period. So unless there's more to this, I think the masses aren't needed.

So, perhaps I should proceed with the distance ratios to compute the period ratios.

So, let's consider the two possibilities for the temperature ratio.

Case 1: T1/T2=1.4 → D2=1.96 D1 → D3=0.37 D1.

Then P3/P1=(0.37)^1.5 ≈0.225 → factor is 0.225 → but the question is looking for P3/P1, which is less than 1. Not matching options.

Case 2: T2/T1=1.4 → D2=0.51 D1 → D3=0.0964 D1.

Then P3/P1=(0.0964)^1.5 ≈0.0298 → factor is 0.0298, also no match.

But the options are all >1.

Wait a second, maybe I have the orbital period formula backwards. Let me double-check.

Kepler's third law is P² = (4 π² G M* )^(-1) * a³.

Wait, no, correct expression is:

P² = (4 π² a³ ) / ( G (M* + M_planet) )

But M_planet << M*, so it's approximately P² = (4 π² a³ )/( G M* )

So, P is proportional to a^(3/2 ) / sqrt(M* )

So for the same star, all planets have the same M*, so P is proportional to a^(3/2 ), where a is the orbital radius.

Thus, P3 / P1 = (a3/a1 )^(3/2 )

So, if a3 > a1, then P3 > P1.

But from the temperature ratios, if T3 is higher, then a3 is smaller, so P3 < P1.

So, the only way for P3 to be larger than P1 is if a3 is larger than a1. Which would require that T3 < T1.

But the given data is that T3 is 2.3 times Planet2, and Planet2 is 1.4 times Planet1. So if T3 is larger than Planet2, which is larger than Planet1, then a3 < a2 < a1.

So, all three planets have a3 < a2 < a1.

So, Planet3 has the smallest a, so the shortest period.

But the question asks by what factor is P3 larger than P1. So P3 is smaller, which would mean the factor is less than 1. But the options are all above 1.

So, this suggests that I'm making a mistake in interpreting the temperature ratios.

Wait, perhaps I got the temperature ratios in the wrong direction. Let's think again.

The problem states: "the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4".

So, when the problem says the ratio of A and B is X, it's usually A/B = X, unless specified otherwise. So, in this case, it's Planet1/Planet2 =1.4 → T1=1.4 T2.

Which would mean Planet1 is hotter, closer to the star, so D1 < D2.

Similarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3 → T2/T3=2.3 → T2=2.3 T3 → so T2 is hotter than T3 → D2 < D3.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if T2 is hotter than T3, then D2 is smaller than D3. That would make Planet3 further away than Planet2, which is further than Planet1.

But that would make the order of the planets' distances: D1 < D2 < D3.

Which would make their orbital periods: P1 < P2 < P3.

So, the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1.

So, in this case, the ratio P3/P1 would be greater than 1.

Let me recalculate the distances under this assumption.

Given:

T1/T2=1.4 → T1=1.4 T2.

So,

T1/T2 = sqrt( D2/D1 )

→ 1.4 = sqrt(D2/D1 ) → D2/D1=1.96 → D2=1.96 D1.

Similarly, T2/T3=2.3 → T2=2.3 T3.

So,

T2/T3 = sqrt( D3/D2 )

→ 2.3 = sqrt(D3/D2 ) → D3/D2 = (2.3)^2=5.29 → D3=5.29 D2.

But D2=1.96 D1, so D3=5.29 *1.96 D1 → approx 10.37 D1.

So, the distances are D1, D2=1.96 D1, D3=10.37 D1.

So, Planet3 is much farther from the star than Planet1.

Now, the periods are proportional to a^(3/2 ), so P3/P1 = (D3/D1 )^(3/2 ) = (10.37 )^(3/2 )

Compute that.

First, sqrt(10.37 ) ≈ 3.22.

Then, 3.22^3 → 3.22 *3.22 = approx 10.368; 10.368 *3.22 ≈ 33.35.

So, P3/P1 ≈33.35.

Looking at the options, D is ~33.4, which is option D.

But wait, let me make sure I'm interpreting the temperature ratios correctly.

If the problem states that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4, it's ambiguous whether it's T1/T2 or T2/T1.

In the initial analysis, I assumed T1/T2=1.4, leading to D2=1.96 D1. But that led to a situation where Planet3's period was smaller than Planet1's, which didn't match the options. However, if I instead take the ratio as T2/T1=1.4, then T2=1.4 T1. Let's see.

Case where T2=1.4 T1:

T2/T1=1.4 → T2=1.4 T1.

So,

T2/T1 = sqrt( D1/D2 )

→1.4 = sqrt(D1/D2 ) → D1/D2=1.96 → D2= D1/1.96 ≈0.51 D1.

Then, T3/T2=2.3 → T3=2.3 T2=2.3*1.4 T1=3.22 T1.

But equilibrium temperature of Planet3 is 2.3 times Planet2's, so T3=2.3 T2.

So,

T3/T2=2.3 → sqrt( D2/D3 )=2.3 → D2/D3=5.29 → D3= D2 /5.29.

Since D2=0.51 D1, D3=0.51 D1 /5.29≈0.0964 D1.

So, D3=0.0964 D1 → which is much closer than Planet1.

So, the periods are P3=P1 * (0.0964 )^(3/2 ) → as before, about 0.224 P1.

So, the factor is 0.224, which is less than one, but the options don't have that.

But in the other case, when T1=1.4 T2, and T2=1.4 T3, we get P3=33.35 P1, which is option D.

So, where does the confusion come from? It's about whether the ratio is T1/T2=1.4 or T2/T1=1.4.

The problem is ambiguous in wording. The phrase "the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4" could be interpreted as T1:T2 =1.4:1, meaning T1=1.4 T2. Alternatively, it could be T2:T1=1.4:1, meaning T2=1.4 T1.

But in the context of exoplanet studies, it's more common to report the ratio as the hotter planet first. So, if Planet1 is hotter than Planet2, T1/T2=1.4.

But in this case, when I took T1=1.4 T2, it led to P3/P1=0.224, which doesn't match any options. However, when I took the ratio as T2=1.4 T1, which would make Planet2 hotter than Planet1, leading to D2=0.51 D1 (Planet2 is closer, so hotter), then Planet3 is further than Planet2, leading to P3=33.4 P1, which is option D.

But wait, in that scenario, T3 would be hotter than T2, meaning D3 is smaller than D2, but earlier calculation in that case led to D3 being 5.29 D2, which is larger, which would mean T3 is colder than T2, which contradicts the given data.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused.

Let me try again.

Assume T2/T1=1.4 → T2 is hotter than T1 → D2 < D1.

Now, T3/T2=2.3 → T3 is hotter than T2 → D3 < D2 → D3 < D2 < D1.

So, the distances: D3 < D2 < D1.

So, P3 < P2 < P1.

So, P3 is the smallest period, P1 the largest.

So, P3 is smaller than P1, so the factor would be less than 1. But the options are all >1.

Thus, this scenario doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the temperature ratio is given as T2 is colder than T1, so T1/T2=1.4 → T1 is hotter, closer, D1< D2.

Then, T3/T2=2.3 → T3 is hotter than T2 → D3 < D2 → so D3 < D2 < D1.

So, P3 < P2 < P1.

Thus, P3 is less than P1. Thus, P3/P1 <1. So, the factor is less than 1, which isn't matching any options.

But if I instead have T3 being 2.3 times colder than T2, which would imply T3/T2=1/2.3 → that's not the case as per the problem statement.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the way I compute the distance ratios.

Let me approach this more methodically.

Let's denote the equilibrium temperatures as T1, T2, T3.

The problem says:

- The ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.4.

Which could mean T1/T2=1.4 or T2/T1=1.4.

Similarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3 → T2/T3=2.3 or T3/T2=2.3.

The problem states: "the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4".

In scientific terms, when we say the ratio of A to B is X, it's A/B=X.

So, for the first ratio: T1/T2=1.4.

Similarly, the second ratio: T2/T3=2.3.

So, T1=1.4 T2.

T2=2.3 T3 → T3= T2/2.3.

So, T1=1.4 * (2.3 T3 )=3.22 T3.

But the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance.

So, T ∝ 1/sqrt(D).

Thus:

T1 = k / sqrt(D1 )

T2 =k / sqrt(D2 )

T3=k / sqrt(D3 )

So,

T1/T2 = (sqrt(D2 ) / sqrt(D1 )) )= sqrt(D2/D1 )

Given T1/T2=1.4 → sqrt(D2/D1 )=1.4 → D2/D1=1.96 → D2=1.96 D1.

Similarly, T2/T3=2.3 → sqrt(D3/D2 )=2.3 → D3/D2=5.29 → D3=5.29 D2.

So,

D3=5.29 *1.96 D1 = approx 10.37 D1.

Thus, Planet3 is at about 10.37 times the distance of Planet1.

Thus, the period of Planet3 is P3 = (D3)^(3/2 ) / (D1)^(3/2 ) ) * P1.

Because P is proportional to D^(3/2 ), so:

P3/P1 = (D3/D1 )^(3/2 ) = (10.37)^(3/2 )

Compute 10.37^0.5 → approx 3.22.

Then, 3.22^3 → 3.22 *3.22=10.368; 10.368 *3.22 ≈33.35.

So, P3/P1=33.35 → approximately 33.4.

Which matches option D.

So, the correct answer is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we analyze the given data using the relationships between equilibrium temperature, distance, and orbital period.

### Key Information:
1. **Equilibrium Temperature Ratios**:
   - \( T_1 / T_2 = 1.4 \)
   - \( T_2 / T_3 = 2.3 \)
   - Equilibrium temperature \( T \) is inversely proportional to \( \sqrt{D} \), where \( D \) is the orbital distance:  
     \[
     \frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{D_2}{D_1}}, \quad \frac{T_2}{T_3} = \sqrt{\frac{D_3}{D_2}}
     \]

2. **Distance Ratios**:
   - From \( T_1 / T_2 = 1.4 \):  
     \[
     \sqrt{\frac{D_2}{D_1}} = 1.4 \implies \frac{D_2}{D_1} = 1.96 \implies D_2 = 1.96 D_1
     \]
   - From \( T_2 / T_3 = 2.3 \):  
     \[
     \sqrt{\frac{D_3}{D_2}} = 2.3 \implies \frac{D_3}{D_2} = 5.29 \implies D_3 = 5.29 D_2
     \]
   - Substituting \( D_2 = 1.96 D_1 \):  
     \[
     D_3 = 5.29 \times 1.96 D_1 \approx 10.37 D_1
     \]

3. **Orbital Period Ratios**:
   - Orbital period \( P \) is proportional to \( D^{3/2} \):  
     \[
     \frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left(\frac{D_3}{D_1}\right)^{3/2}
     \]
   - Substituting \( D_3 / D_1 = 10.37 \):  
     \[
     \frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.37)^{3/2}
     \]
   - Compute \( (10.37)^{3/2} \):  
     \[
     \sqrt{10.37} \approx 3.22, \quad (3.22)^3 \approx 33.35
     \]

### Conclusion:
The orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1. This matches option **D**.

ANSWER: D

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this astronomy problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, there are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They have circular orbits and were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for Transit Timing Variation. But I don't think that part is super relevant to the question. The important stuff is about their equilibrium temperatures and masses, and from that, I need to find out how much larger the orbital period of Planet3 is compared to Planet1.

Hmm. The given data: the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4. So, T2/T1 ≈1.4. Similarly, T3/T2 is about 2.3, so T3/T2≈2.3. That means T3 is 2.3 times T2, and since T2 is 1.4 times T1, T3 is 1.4 *2.3 = 3.22 times T1. So T3 is about 3.22 times hotter than Planet1.

Then the mass ratios: Planet1 and Planet2 have a mass ratio of about 1.15. So M2/M1≈1.15. And M3/M2 is 1.35, so M3 is 1.35 times M2. So M3 = 1.35 * M2, and since M2 is 1.15 * M1, M3 is 1.35 *1.15 * M1 = approximately 1.5525 M1. So Planet3 is about 1.55 times as massive as Planet1.

The albedo for all three is 0.3, same as Earth. Albedo affects the equilibrium temperature because it determines how much light is reflected. The formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T = [ (L (1 - a))/(16 π σ D²) ) ]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is albedo, and D is the distance from the star.

Wait, but all the planets are around the same star, right? Because when we talk about exoplanets, each is in its own system, but I think in this case, since it's a system of three, they all orbit the same star. So L is the same for all three. So the equilibrium temperature ratio between them depends on the square root of their orbital distances.

Wait, let me get the formula right. The equilibrium temperature T is proportional to [ (L (1 - a)) / D² ]^(1/4). Since L and a are the same for all, T is proportional to D^(-1/2). So if T increases, D decreases. Because as you get closer to the star, the temperature goes up.

So for the ratio T1 / T2 = 1.4. So since T is inversely proportional to D^0.5, the ratio T1/T2 = (D2/D1)^(0.5). Because T ∝ 1/sqrt(D), so T1 = sqrt(L/(16πσ D1²)) ... but perhaps a better way is to write the ratio.

Wait, let me write the formula correctly. The equilibrium temperature T is given by:

T = [ ( L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ D²) ]^(1/4 )

So, T proportional to sqrt( (1 - a) / D² )^ (1/2 ), but wait, no. Let me square both sides:

T^4 is proportional to (1 - a) / D² → T^4 ∝ (1/D²) → T ∝ 1 / D^(1/2)

So T is proportional to 1 / sqrt(D). So, T1 / T2 = sqrt( D2 / D1 )

Because T1 = k / sqrt(D1), T2 = k / sqrt(D2), so T1/T2 = sqrt(D2/D1). So if T1/T2 is 1.4, then sqrt(D2/D1) = 1.4 → D2/D1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So D2 = 1.96 * D1. So Planet2 is farther from the star than Planet1. Because a higher T means closer in, right? So if Planet2 is hotter than Planet1, it's closer. Wait, wait, wait—no. Wait, wait a minute, no! Wait, equilibrium temperature depends on distance. If a planet is closer, T is higher. So if Planet2 has a higher equilibrium temperature than Planet1, Planet2 must be closer to the star. So D2 < D1. Wait, but according to the ratio above, we have D2/D1 = (T1/T2)^2. Wait, no:

Wait, T1 is Planet1's temperature. Let me see. Correct the ratio: T1 = (L (1 - a)/(16 π σ D1² ))^(1/4 )

T2 = (L (1 - a)/(16 π σ D2² ))^(1/4 )

So the ratio T2 / T1 is equal to [ (D1²) / (D2²) ]^(1/4 )

Because if you take T2 / T1 = ( ( (1-a)/L etc. )^(1/4 ) for D2 over D1.

So T2/T1 = ( D1² / D2² )^(1/4 ) = (D1/D2 )^(1/2 )

Because (D1^2 / D2^2) is (D1/D2)^2. So taking the 1/4 power, that becomes (D1/D2)^(1/2).

So, T2/T1 = sqrt( D1/D2 )

So if T2/T1 is 1.4, then sqrt(D1/D2) =1.4 → D1/D2 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96 → D2 = D1 / 1.96 → D2 ≈ 0.51 D1.

So Planet2 is about half the distance of Planet1 from the star. So D2 is closer.

Similarly, for Planet3 and Planet2: T3/T2 = 2.3, so T3 =2.3 * T2.

Using the same ratio:

T3 / T2 = sqrt( D2 / D3 ) → 2.3 = sqrt( D2/D3 )

Squaring both sides: 2.3^2 = (D2/D3) → 5.29 = D2/D3 → D3 = D2 /5.29.

Since D2 is 0.51 D1, D3 = (0.51 D1) / 5.29 ≈ 0.51 /5.29 D1 ≈ 0.0964 D1.

So Planet3 is about 0.0964 times the orbital distance of Planet1. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait. Let me double-check.

Wait, no. Because if T3 is larger than T2, then Planet3 must be closer to the star than Planet2. So D3 is less than D2.

Wait, so:

From T3 / T2 = 2.3, using the same formula:

T3 = (L (1 - a)/(16 π σ D3² ))^(1/4 )

T2 = same with D2.

So T3 / T2 = sqrt( D2 / D3 )

So 2.3 = sqrt( D2/D3 ) → D2/D3 = 5.29 → D3 = D2 /5.29.

Since D2 is already 0.51 D1, D3 = 0.51 D1 /5.29 ≈ 0.0964 D1.

So the distances are: D1 (Planet1), D2 = 0.51 D1, D3=0.0964 D1.

Wait, but that would mean Planet3 is much closer than Planet1. Hmm, but let's remember that orbital period is related to the distance via Kepler's third law.

Kepler's third law says that (D^3)/(P^2) = (G M_total) / (4 π² ), where M_total is the mass of the star plus the planets. But in most cases, the star's mass is way larger than the planets, so we can approximate M_total as just the star's mass, M*. So for each planet, we can write:

P^2 = (4 π² D^3 )/( G M* )

But wait, in reality, each planet's orbit is around the same star, so M* is the same. So for each planet, P is proportional to D^(3/2 ) / sqrt(M* )

But if we take the ratio of periods, say P3/P1, since M* is the same, it's ( D3^(3/2) ) / ( D1^(3/2) ) ) → (D3/D1 )^(3/2 )

So P3/P1 = ( D3 / D1 )^(3/2 )

We already have D3 = 0.0964 D1.

So D3/D1 = 0.0964.

So (0.0964)^(3/2 ) → Let's calculate that.

First, sqrt(0.0964 ) is approximately 0.3105. Then, 0.3105^3 is about 0.0298.

So P3/P1 ≈ 0.0298. Wait, that would mean P3 is much smaller than P1, but that's not possible because Planet3 is much closer to the star, so it should have a much shorter orbital period, right? Wait, but the question is asking by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1. So if P3 is smaller than P1, the factor would be less than 1. But that's not any of the answer options. All the options are greater than 1.

Wait, did I get something wrong? Let me double-check.

Wait, the equilibrium temperature of Planet3 is higher than Planet2, which in turn is higher than Planet1. So Planet3 is the closest, then Planet2, then Planet1 is the farthest. So P3 < P2 < P1. So the orbital period of Planet3 is shorter than Planet1's. So P3/P1 would be less than 1, meaning Planet3's period is smaller, but the question is asking by what factor is Planet3's period larger than Planet1's. So that would be a factor less than 1. But all the options are like 3.2, 10, etc. So that seems conflicting.

Hmm, perhaps I made an error in the way I applied the ratios.

Wait, going back. The equilibrium temperatures are given as Planet1 and Planet2 as ratio 1.4. So T2 is 1.4 times T1? Or is it T1 over T2?

Wait, the question says: "the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4."

Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Does it mean T1/T2 =1.4 or T2/T1=1.4?

Wait, in the problem statement: "the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4." So it's T1 : T2 =1.4. Which would mean T1 is larger than T2 by a factor of 1.4. But that would imply Planet1 is hotter than Planet2, which, if they are around the same star, would mean Planet1 is closer. But earlier, when I calculated, I assumed T2 is larger than T1, but perhaps that's the mistake.

Wait, if T1 is hotter than T2, that would mean Planet1 is closer to the star, so D1 < D2. So let's redo the ratios correctly.

Let me restate the given ratios.

Problem says:

Ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approx 1.4. So it could be T1/T2=1.4 or T2/T1=1.4. Hmm. The way the question is phrased, it's not clear. But in the context of exoplanets, I think that the ratio is T1 over T2. So perhaps T1 is hotter than T2, meaning D1 is less than D2. So Planet1 is closer, hotter.

So let's recompute.

So if T1/T2 =1.4, then T2 = T1 /1.4.

But wait, equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance. So when T1 is higher than T2, that would mean D1 is less than D2.

Yes, so T1 is higher → Planet1 is closer to the star.

So let's correctly compute the distance ratios.

Given that, T1 / T2 =1.4 → T1 =1.4 T2.

But since T is proportional to 1/sqrt(D), we have:

T1 / T2 = sqrt( D2 / D1 )

So 1.4 = sqrt( D2/D1 )

Squaring both sides: 1.96 = D2/D1 → D2 = 1.96 D1.

So Planet2 is further from the star than Planet1.

Similarly, T3/T2 is about 2.3 → T3=2.3 T2.

So T3/T2 = sqrt( D2/D3 )

2.3 = sqrt( D2/D3 )

Squaring: 5.29 = D2/D3 → D3 = D2 /5.29.

Since D2 is 1.96 D1, D3= (1.96 D1)/5.29 ≈ 0.37 D1.

So Planet3 is at about 0.37 times the distance of Planet1 from the star.

So now, the distances are: Planet1 at D1, Planet2 at 1.96 D1, Planet3 at 0.37 D1.

So to find the orbital periods, we use Kepler's third law.

But wait, each planet is orbiting the same star, so M* is constant. So for each planet, P² = (4 π² D³)/( G M* )

So the ratio of periods between two planets is (D2³ / D1³ )^(1/2 ), because P² is proportional to D³.

So P3 / P1 = sqrt( (D3³) / (D1³) ) ) = ( D3 / D1 )^(3/2 )

We have D3/D1 = 0.37. So 0.37^(3/2 ) → let's compute that.

First, take the square root of 0.37: sqrt(0.37) ≈ 0.608.

Then, cube that: 0.608^3 ≈ 0.608 *0.608=0.369; 0.369 *0.608≈0.224.

So P3/P1 = 0.224. So Planet3's period is about 0.224 times that of Planet1. But the question is asking by what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1. That would be 1/0.224 ≈4.46. So about 4.4 times larger. So the answer would be option C) ~4.4.

Wait, but earlier I thought that Planet3 was further away, but no, according to this, Planet3 is closer. So D3 is smaller than D1, so P3 is smaller. But according to this calculation, P3 is 0.224 P1, so the period of Planet3 is smaller than Planet1. But the question is, "By what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1?" So if P3 is smaller, it's a factor less than 1. But that's not matching any of the options. Wait, but I must have made a mistake.

Wait, no, no, wait. Wait, no. Let's get this straight. If Planet3 has a much shorter orbital period than Planet1, then P3 is less than P1. So the factor would be less than 1. But the options are all greater than 1. So I must have messed up the ratio.

Wait, perhaps I reversed the ratio. Let me re-examine.

Wait, the question asks, "By what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1?"

So the factor is P3 / P1.

If P3 is larger, the factor is greater than 1. If smaller, it's less than 1.

In our current calculation, P3 is 0.224 times P1. So the factor is 0.224, which is less than 1. But the options given are all greater than 1. So something is wrong here.

Ah, wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of P3/P1. Let me think again.

Wait, I have D3 = 0.37 D1.

So P3² ∝ D3³ → P3² = (0.37 D1 )³ → P3² = 0.37³ D1³.

Similarly, P1² ∝ D1³ → P1² = D1³.

So the ratio (P3²)/(P1²) = (0.37^3 D1^3 )/( D1^3 ) )= 0.37^3.

So P3/P1 = sqrt(0.37^3 ) = 0.37^(3/2 )

Which is what I did earlier, leading to 0.224.

So that would make P3 less than P1. So the factor is 0.224, meaning Planet3's period is about a fifth of Planet1's. So the question is, why are the options all larger than 1? Did I perhaps mix up the ratios?

Wait, perhaps I should reverse the ratio. Maybe I need to compute P1/P3, which would be 1/0.224≈4.46. So that would make P1's period about 4.46 times longer than Planet3's. But the question is, which way around? The question is, how much larger is P3 than P1. So in that case, if P3 is smaller, it's not larger. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, another possibility is that I messed up the equilibrium temperature ratio. Let me re-express the equilibrium temperature formula correctly.

Equilibrium temperature T = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ D²) ]^(1/4 )

So, T is proportional to (1/D)^(1/2 ), because when you take D squared in the denominator, the square root gives D^(-1/2 ).

So, T ∝ 1 / sqrt(D).

So if T increases, D decreases.

So, given that, if Planet3 has a higher equilibrium temperature than Planet2, it must be closer to the star than Planet2, which is closer than Planet1.

Wait, no. Wait, the given T ratios are:

Planet1 and Planet2: T1/T2=1.4 → so T1 is larger, so D1 < D2.

Planet2 and Planet3: T3/T2=2.3 → T3 is larger, so D3 < D2.

So distances: D3 < D2 < D1.

So Planet3 is closest to the star, then Planet2, then Planet1 is farthest.

So, in terms of orbital periods, the period increases as the distance increases.

So if Planet3 is closest, its period is the shortest, Planet1 is farthest, period is longest.

But the question is, by what factor is Planet3's period larger than Planet1's. So Planet3's period is smaller, so the factor would be less than 1. But all answer options are >1, so something's wrong.

Wait, perhaps the mass ratios are affecting the calculation. Because the period depends on the mass of the star and the planet. Wait, but in the Kepler's third law, when considering a planet orbiting a star, the period depends on the mass of the star and the semi-major axis. Since all the planets are orbiting the same star, the mass of the star is same for all. So the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star. So the mass of the planet doesn't significantly affect the period.

Thus, the period ratio depends only on the cube of the distance.

Wait, but let me make sure. The exact form of Kepler's third law is P² = (4 π² / (G M* )) * a³.

So M* is the mass of the star. So if M* is the same for all planets, the period only depends on a (distance). So the mass of the planet doesn't matter in the law when the star is much more massive.

Thus, the masses given in the problem (Planet1, Planet2, Planet3 masses) might not affect the orbital period calculation. So perhaps the mass data is a red herring, or used for another part of the problem that's not relevant here.

But wait, why is the mass ratio given? Because the question is about the orbital period. Hmm. Unless, considering the TTV method, the mass of the planet affects the timing of transits, but in this question, the orbital period is being asked, which is a function of the distance and the star's mass.

So perhaps I should ignore the mass ratios for the purpose of calculating the periods. Because the period depends on the star's mass and the planet's distance.

So, back to the problem. So, the periods are determined by the distances. So, from the equilibrium temperature ratios, we can get the distance ratios. Then, using Kepler's law, find the period ratios.

So, to recap:

Given:

T1/T2 =1.4 → T1=1.4 T2.

Since T ∝ 1/sqrt(D), T1=1.4 T2 → 1/sqrt(D1) =1.4 / sqrt(D2 )

Wait, no. Let me express the ratio correctly.

T1 / T2 = sqrt( D2 / D1 )

So 1.4 = sqrt(D2/D1) → D2/D1 = (1.4)^2 =1.96 → D2=1.96 D1.

Similarly, T3/T2=2.3 → sqrt(D2/D3 )=2.3 → D2/D3=5.29 → D3= D2/5.29.

Since D2 is 1.96 D1, D3=1.96 D1 /5.29 ≈ 0.37 D1.

So D3=0.37 D1.

So, the periods are proportional to D^(3/2 )

So, P3/P1 = (D3/D1 )^(3/2 ) = (0.37)^(3/2 )

Compute 0.37^1.5:

0.37^0.5 ≈ 0.608.

0.608 *0.37 ≈ 0.225.

So P3/P1 ≈ 0.225.

So, the period of Planet3 is approx 0.225 times that of Planet1. So, the period of Planet3 is about 22.5% of Planet1's. So, the factor by which Planet3's period is larger than Planet1's is 0.225, which is less than 1. But the options are all greater than 1.

So, I must have made a mistake in the setup. Alternatively, perhaps the temperature ratios are T2/T1=1.4, not T1/T2=1.4.

Let me try that.

If T2/T1=1.4, then:

T2 =1.4 T1.

Since T ∝ 1/sqrt(D), T2 =1.4 T1 → 1/sqrt(D2) =1.4 / sqrt(D1 )

Which gives sqrt(D1/D2 )=1.4 → D1/D2=1.96 → D2 = D1/1.96 ≈0.51 D1.

Similarly, T3/T2=2.3 → T3=2.3 T2.

So, 1/sqrt(D3) =2.3 / sqrt(D2 )

So sqrt(D2/D3 )=2.3 → D2/D3= (2.3)^2=5.29 → D3= D2/5.29.

Since D2=0.51 D1, D3=0.51 D1 /5.29 ≈0.0964 D1.

So D3 is about 0.0964 D1.

Now, the periods are proportional to D^(3/2).

So, P3/P1 = (D3/D1 )^(3/2 ) → (0.0964 )^1.5 = ?

Compute 0.0964^0.5: sqrt(0.0964)= approx 0.3105.

Then, 0.3105 *0.0964 ≈ 0.0298.

So, P3 is about 0.0298 times P1 → P3 = 0.0298 P1 → so the factor is 0.0298, which is even smaller, but that's not matching any options either.

Hmm, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should approach this differently.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the orbital periods, and the data given includes the masses, but I wasn't considering them. But earlier, I thought the mass of the planet doesn't affect the period. Or does it?

Wait, wait, in reality, for a planet's orbital period, the mass of the planet is negligible compared to the star's mass, so the period depends only on the star's mass and the distance. So the planet's mass doesn't play a role.

So the mass ratios given in the problem are probably irrelevant to the orbital period calculation. So perhaps I should ignore the mass data.

Wait, but the question is about the orbital period. So unless there's more to this, I think the masses aren't needed.

So, perhaps I should proceed with the distance ratios to compute the period ratios.

So, let's consider the two possibilities for the temperature ratio.

Case 1: T1/T2=1.4 → D2=1.96 D1 → D3=0.37 D1.

Then P3/P1=(0.37)^1.5 ≈0.225 → factor is 0.225 → but the question is looking for P3/P1, which is less than 1. Not matching options.

Case 2: T2/T1=1.4 → D2=0.51 D1 → D3=0.0964 D1.

Then P3/P1=(0.0964)^1.5 ≈0.0298 → factor is 0.0298, also no match.

But the options are all >1.

Wait a second, maybe I have the orbital period formula backwards. Let me double-check.

Kepler's third law is P² = (4 π² G M* )^(-1) * a³.

Wait, no, correct expression is:

P² = (4 π² a³ ) / ( G (M* + M_planet) )

But M_planet << M*, so it's approximately P² = (4 π² a³ )/( G M* )

So, P is proportional to a^(3/2 ) / sqrt(M* )

So for the same star, all planets have the same M*, so P is proportional to a^(3/2 ), where a is the orbital radius.

Thus, P3 / P1 = (a3/a1 )^(3/2 )

So, if a3 > a1, then P3 > P1.

But from the temperature ratios, if T3 is higher, then a3 is smaller, so P3 < P1.

So, the only way for P3 to be larger than P1 is if a3 is larger than a1. Which would require that T3 < T1.

But the given data is that T3 is 2.3 times Planet2, and Planet2 is 1.4 times Planet1. So if T3 is larger than Planet2, which is larger than Planet1, then a3 < a2 < a1.

So, all three planets have a3 < a2 < a1.

So, Planet3 has the smallest a, so the shortest period.

But the question asks by what factor is P3 larger than P1. So P3 is smaller, which would mean the factor is less than 1. But the options are all above 1.

So, this suggests that I'm making a mistake in interpreting the temperature ratios.

Wait, perhaps I got the temperature ratios in the wrong direction. Let's think again.

The problem states: "the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4".

So, when the problem says the ratio of A and B is X, it's usually A/B = X, unless specified otherwise. So, in this case, it's Planet1/Planet2 =1.4 → T1=1.4 T2.

Which would mean Planet1 is hotter, closer to the star, so D1 < D2.

Similarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3 → T2/T3=2.3 → T2=2.3 T3 → so T2 is hotter than T3 → D2 < D3.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if T2 is hotter than T3, then D2 is smaller than D3. That would make Planet3 further away than Planet2, which is further than Planet1.

But that would make the order of the planets' distances: D1 < D2 < D3.

Which would make their orbital periods: P1 < P2 < P3.

So, the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1.

So, in this case, the ratio P3/P1 would be greater than 1.

Let me recalculate the distances under this assumption.

Given:

T1/T2=1.4 → T1=1.4 T2.

So,

T1/T2 = sqrt( D2/D1 )

→ 1.4 = sqrt(D2/D1 ) → D2/D1=1.96 → D2=1.96 D1.

Similarly, T2/T3=2.3 → T2=2.3 T3.

So,

T2/T3 = sqrt( D3/D2 )

→ 2.3 = sqrt(D3/D2 ) → D3/D2 = (2.3)^2=5.29 → D3=5.29 D2.

But D2=1.96 D1, so D3=5.29 *1.96 D1 → approx 10.37 D1.

So, the distances are D1, D2=1.96 D1, D3=10.37 D1.

So, Planet3 is much farther from the star than Planet1.

Now, the periods are proportional to a^(3/2 ), so P3/P1 = (D3/D1 )^(3/2 ) = (10.37 )^(3/2 )

Compute that.

First, sqrt(10.37 ) ≈ 3.22.

Then, 3.22^3 → 3.22 *3.22 = approx 10.368; 10.368 *3.22 ≈ 33.35.

So, P3/P1 ≈33.35.

Looking at the options, D is ~33.4, which is option D.

But wait, let me make sure I'm interpreting the temperature ratios correctly.

If the problem states that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4, it's ambiguous whether it's T1/T2 or T2/T1.

In the initial analysis, I assumed T1/T2=1.4, leading to D2=1.96 D1. But that led to a situation where Planet3's period was smaller than Planet1's, which didn't match the options. However, if I instead take the ratio as T2/T1=1.4, then T2=1.4 T1. Let's see.

Case where T2=1.4 T1:

T2/T1=1.4 → T2=1.4 T1.

So,

T2/T1 = sqrt( D1/D2 )

→1.4 = sqrt(D1/D2 ) → D1/D2=1.96 → D2= D1/1.96 ≈0.51 D1.

Then, T3/T2=2.3 → T3=2.3 T2=2.3*1.4 T1=3.22 T1.

But equilibrium temperature of Planet3 is 2.3 times Planet2's, so T3=2.3 T2.

So,

T3/T2=2.3 → sqrt( D2/D3 )=2.3 → D2/D3=5.29 → D3= D2 /5.29.

Since D2=0.51 D1, D3=0.51 D1 /5.29≈0.0964 D1.

So, D3=0.0964 D1 → which is much closer than Planet1.

So, the periods are P3=P1 * (0.0964 )^(3/2 ) → as before, about 0.224 P1.

So, the factor is 0.224, which is less than one, but the options don't have that.

But in the other case, when T1=1.4 T2, and T2=1.4 T3, we get P3=33.35 P1, which is option D.

So, where does the confusion come from? It's about whether the ratio is T1/T2=1.4 or T2/T1=1.4.

The problem is ambiguous in wording. The phrase "the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4" could be interpreted as T1:T2 =1.4:1, meaning T1=1.4 T2. Alternatively, it could be T2:T1=1.4:1, meaning T2=1.4 T1.

But in the context of exoplanet studies, it's more common to report the ratio as the hotter planet first. So, if Planet1 is hotter than Planet2, T1/T2=1.4.

But in this case, when I took T1=1.4 T2, it led to P3/P1=0.224, which doesn't match any options. However, when I took the ratio as T2=1.4 T1, which would make Planet2 hotter than Planet1, leading to D2=0.51 D1 (Planet2 is closer, so hotter), then Planet3 is further than Planet2, leading to P3=33.4 P1, which is option D.

But wait, in that scenario, T3 would be hotter than T2, meaning D3 is smaller than D2, but earlier calculation in that case led to D3 being 5.29 D2, which is larger, which would mean T3 is colder than T2, which contradicts the given data.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused.

Let me try again.

Assume T2/T1=1.4 → T2 is hotter than T1 → D2 < D1.

Now, T3/T2=2.3 → T3 is hotter than T2 → D3 < D2 → D3 < D2 < D1.

So, the distances: D3 < D2 < D1.

So, P3 < P2 < P1.

So, P3 is the smallest period, P1 the largest.

So, P3 is smaller than P1, so the factor would be less than 1. But the options are all >1.

Thus, this scenario doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the temperature ratio is given as T2 is colder than T1, so T1/T2=1.4 → T1 is hotter, closer, D1< D2.

Then, T3/T2=2.3 → T3 is hotter than T2 → D3 < D2 → so D3 < D2 < D1.

So, P3 < P2 < P1.

Thus, P3 is less than P1. Thus, P3/P1 <1. So, the factor is less than 1, which isn't matching any options.

But if I instead have T3 being 2.3 times colder than T2, which would imply T3/T2=1/2.3 → that's not the case as per the problem statement.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the way I compute the distance ratios.

Let me approach this more methodically.

Let's denote the equilibrium temperatures as T1, T2, T3.

The problem says:

- The ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.4.

Which could mean T1/T2=1.4 or T2/T1=1.4.

Similarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3 → T2/T3=2.3 or T3/T2=2.3.

The problem states: "the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4".

In scientific terms, when we say the ratio of A to B is X, it's A/B=X.

So, for the first ratio: T1/T2=1.4.

Similarly, the second ratio: T2/T3=2.3.

So, T1=1.4 T2.

T2=2.3 T3 → T3= T2/2.3.

So, T1=1.4 * (2.3 T3 )=3.22 T3.

But the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance.

So, T ∝ 1/sqrt(D).

Thus:

T1 = k / sqrt(D1 )

T2 =k / sqrt(D2 )

T3=k / sqrt(D3 )

So,

T1/T2 = (sqrt(D2 ) / sqrt(D1 )) )= sqrt(D2/D1 )

Given T1/T2=1.4 → sqrt(D2/D1 )=1.4 → D2/D1=1.96 → D2=1.96 D1.

Similarly, T2/T3=2.3 → sqrt(D3/D2 )=2.3 → D3/D2=5.29 → D3=5.29 D2.

So,

D3=5.29 *1.96 D1 = approx 10.37 D1.

Thus, Planet3 is at about 10.37 times the distance of Planet1.

Thus, the period of Planet3 is P3 = (D3)^(3/2 ) / (D1)^(3/2 ) ) * P1.

Because P is proportional to D^(3/2 ), so:

P3/P1 = (D3/D1 )^(3/2 ) = (10.37)^(3/2 )

Compute 10.37^0.5 → approx 3.22.

Then, 3.22^3 → 3.22 *3.22=10.368; 10.368 *3.22 ≈33.35.

So, P3/P1=33.35 → approximately 33.4.

Which matches option D.

So, the correct answer is option D.


To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we analyze the given data using the relationships between equilibrium temperature, distance, and orbital period.

### Key Information:
1. **Equilibrium Temperature Ratios**:
   - \( T_1 / T_2 = 1.4 \)
   - \( T_2 / T_3 = 2.3 \)
   - Equilibrium temperature \( T \) is inversely proportional to \( \sqrt{D} \), where \( D \) is the orbital distance:  
     \[
     \frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{D_2}{D_1}}, \quad \frac{T_2}{T_3} = \sqrt{\frac{D_3}{D_2}}
     \]

2. **Distance Ratios**:
   - From \( T_1 / T_2 = 1.4 \):  
     \[
     \sqrt{\frac{D_2}{D_1}} = 1.4 \implies \frac{D_2}{D_1} = 1.96 \implies D_2 = 1.96 D_1
     \]
   - From \( T_2 / T_3 = 2.3 \):  
     \[
     \sqrt{\frac{D_3}{D_2}} = 2.3 \implies \frac{D_3}{D_2} = 5.29 \implies D_3 = 5.29 D_2
     \]
   - Substituting \( D_2 = 1.96 D_1 \):  
     \[
     D_3 = 5.29 \times 1.96 D_1 \approx 10.37 D_1
     \]

3. **Orbital Period Ratios**:
   - Orbital period \( P \) is proportional to \( D^{3/2} \):  
     \[
     \frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left(\frac{D_3}{D_1}\right)^{3/2}
     \]
   - Substituting \( D_3 / D_1 = 10.37 \):  
     \[
     \frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.37)^{3/2}
     \]
   - Compute \( (10.37)^{3/2} \):  
     \[
     \sqrt{10.37} \approx 3.22, \quad (3.22)^3 \approx 33.35
     \]

### Conclusion:
The orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1. This matches option **D**.

ANSWER: D
