Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question gives me the state of a system as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Then there's this observable represented by matrix P. I need to find the probability that measuring P will give 0.

Hmm, right. I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables correspond to Hermitian operators, and their eigenvalues represent the possible measurement outcomes. So first, I think I need to find the eigenvalues of matrix P because those will give me the possible results when I measure the observable.

Wait, the matrix P is given as:
First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

So it's a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it down:

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

I should check if P is Hermitian. Hermitian matrices are equal to their conjugate transpose. Looking at P, since all the elements are real, the conjugate transpose is just the transpose. So let's transpose it. The (1,2) element becomes (2,1), which is 1/√2, same as original. (1,3) becomes (3,1), which is 0. (2,3) becomes (3,2), which is 1/√2. So yes, P is equal to its transpose, so it's Hermitian. That makes sense because observables are Hermitian.

Now, to find the eigenvalues. The eigenvalues λ satisfy det(P - λI) = 0. Let me set up the characteristic equation.

The matrix P - λI would be:

[-λ, 1/√2, 0]
[1/√2, -λ, 1/√2]
[0, 1/√2, -λ]

The determinant of this matrix is zero. Let me compute the determinant.

The determinant for a 3x3 matrix can be calculated using the rule of Sarrus or expansion by minors. I'll expand along the first row.

So, det = -λ * det of the minor [[-λ, 1/√2], [1/√2, -λ]] 
          - (1/√2) * det of the minor [[1/√2, 1/√2], [0, -λ]]
          + 0 * det of whatever (which is zero, so that term drops).

So the first term is -λ [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ]
= -λ [ λ² - (1/2) ]

The second term is - (1/√2) [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ]
= - (1/√2) [ (-λ/√2) ]
= - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) 
= (λ)/(2 )

Third term is zero.

So the determinant equation becomes:

-λ (λ² - 1/2) + (λ/2) = 0

Let me expand that:

-λ³ + (λ/2) + (λ/2) = 0

Wait, because -λ*(λ²) is -λ³, and -λ*(-1/2) is +λ*(1/2). So:

-λ³ + (λ/2) + (λ/2) = 0

Wait, no. The first term is -λ*(λ² - 1/2) = -λ³ + (λ/2)
Then the second term is + (λ/2). So total:

(-λ³ + (λ/2)) + (λ/2) = -λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = -λ³ + λ.

So the equation is -λ³ + λ = 0.

Factor out λ: λ (-λ² +1 )= 0.

So λ ( - (λ² -1) ) =0 → λ ( -(λ-1)(λ+1) ) )=0 → λ (1 - λ^2 )=0.

So the solutions are λ=0, λ=1, λ= -1.

Wait, wait, let me double-check the algebra. The equation is -λ^3 + λ =0 → λ (-λ^2 + 1 )=0 → λ (1 - λ^2 )=0.

So the roots are λ=0, and 1 - λ²=0 → λ²=1 → λ=±1.

So the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1. So the possible outcomes when measuring P are 0, 1, and -1.

The question asks for the probability of measuring 0. So I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to λ=0 and compute the probability amplitude of the system's state in that eigenvector.

Wait, the system's state is given as a column vector (-1, 2, 1). Let me note that. So the state vector is |ψ> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.

But wait, in quantum mechanics, states should be normalized. Let me check if this vector is normalized.

The norm is | -1 |² + |2|² + |1|² = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the state is not normalized. Hmm, but perhaps the problem doesn't require normalization because the probabilities will be based on the projection regardless of normalization. Or perhaps the state is given as a vector, and the probabilities are calculated without worrying about normalization for the state. Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the state should be normalized, but maybe in this problem, it's not, so perhaps I should proceed as is.

So the eigenvector for λ=0 is the vector |v> such that (P - 0 I)|v> =0 → P|v> = 0.

So I need to solve P |v> = 0.

Let me write P|v>=0:

The matrix P multiplied by vector v = [a, b, c]^T equals zero vector.

So, the equations are:

Row 1: (0)a + (1/√2) b + 0 c = 0 → (1/√2) b =0 → b=0.

Row 2: (1/√2) a + 0 b + (1/√2) c =0 → (1/√2)(a + c) )=0 → a + c=0 → c= -a.

Row 3: 0 a + (1/√2) b + 0 c =0 → same as row 1, since b=0.

So the eigenvectors for λ=0 are vectors where b=0 and c = -a. So the eigenvectors can be written as [a, 0, -a]^T. So any scalar multiple, so a basis vector is [1, 0, -1]^T. So the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by this vector.

Now, the probability of measuring 0 is the square of the absolute value of the projection of |ψ> onto this eigenvector.

Wait, but since the eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis, right? Because for each eigenvalue, the eigenvectors are orthogonal. Wait, no, not necessarily, but in this case, the eigenvectors for different eigenvalues are orthogonal. Hmm, but perhaps I should construct an orthonormal basis for the eigenspace, but in this case, the eigenspace is one-dimensional, so the normalized eigenvector is simply (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, 0, -1]^T. Wait, because the length is sqrt(1² +0 + (-1)^2 )= sqrt(2), so normalization factor is 1/sqrt(2).

So the normalized eigenvector |v0> is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2) )^T.

Now, the state |ψ> is [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.

The projection of |ψ> onto |v0> is the inner product of |ψ> and |v0>.

So, the inner product is:

(-1)*(1/sqrt(2)) + 2*0 + 1*(-1/sqrt(2)) )

= (-1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)).

= (-2/sqrt(2)).

Simplify: 2/sqrt(2) is sqrt(2), so -sqrt(2).

Wait, but wait: inner product is a scalar, and the projection coefficient is this value. Then the probability is the square of the absolute value of this coefficient.

Wait, but wait: no, the projection is the inner product, which is the amplitude. The probability is |amplitude|^2.

So the amplitude is [ (-1)(1/√2) ) + (2)(0) + (1)(-1/√2) ] → (-1/√2) + (-1/√2) = (-2/√2) = -sqrt(2).

So the amplitude is -sqrt(2). So the probability is (sqrt(2))^2 = 2.

Wait, that can't be right because probabilities can't be more than 1. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, no, wait. Because |v0> is a unit vector. So the inner product should be amplitudes. But let's double-check the calculation.

Wait, the inner product is:

[ -1, 2, 1 ] · [1/√2, 0, -1/√2 ].

So:

(-1)*(1/√2) + (2)*(0) + (1)*(-1/√2) → (-1/√2) + (0) + (-1/√2) )= (-2)/√2.

Which is -√2.

The absolute value squared is (sqrt(2))^2 = 2. But that's 2, which is more than 1. That can't be a probability. So I must have made a mistake in the process.

Wait, but I think I forgot to normalize the state vector |ψ>. Because in quantum mechanics, the state must be normalized, so perhaps I should first normalize |ψ>, or perhaps the question assumes it's already normalized, but in this case, it's not.

Wait, the state is given as (-1, 2, 1), which has a norm squared of 6. So the normalized state would be (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1, 2, 1 ].

So when I compute the inner product, I should take the normalized |ψ> and |v0>.

So let's correct that.

The normalized |ψ> is (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ].

The normalized |v0> is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1 ].

So the inner product is:

(1/sqrt(6)) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) * [ (-1)(1) + 2*0 + 1*(-1) ]

Wait, no, wait: the inner product is:

(1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ] · (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1 ]

Which is (1/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2))) ) * [ (-1)(1) + 2*0 + 1*(-1) ]

= (1/(sqrt(12))) ) * [ (-1) + 0 + (-1) ) ]

= (1/(2*sqrt(3))) ) * (-2) )

= (-2)/(2 sqrt(3)) ) → (-1)/sqrt(3).

So the amplitude is -1/sqrt(3).

The probability is |amplitude|^2 → (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.

Wait, that makes sense. So the probability is 1/3.

So looking at the options, option C is 1/3.

So the correct answer is C.

To solve the problem, we calculate the probability of measuring the observable \( P \) to yield 0. The observable \( P \) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( P \)
The eigenvalues of \( P \) are determined by solving the characteristic equation \(\det(P - \lambda I) = 0\). After computation, the eigenvalues are found to be \( \lambda = 0, 1, -1 \). Thus, the possible measurement outcomes are 0, 1, and -1.

### Step 2: Eigenvector for \( \lambda = 0 \)
For \( \lambda = 0 \), the eigenvector satisfies \( P|v\rangle = 0 \). Solving the system, the eigenvector corresponding to \( \lambda = 0 \) is:

\[
|v_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: State Vector and Normalization
The state vector is given as \( |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \). Its norm is:

\[
\|\psi\| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

The normalized state is:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 4: Projection onto \( |v_0\rangle \)
The probability of measuring 0 is the square of the absolute value of the projection of \( |\psi\rangle \) onto \( |v_0\rangle \). The projection is:

\[
\langle v_0 | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

\[
\langle v_0 | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} \left[ (-1)(1) + (2)(0) + (1)(-1) \right] = \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} (-2) = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
|\langle v_0 | \psi \rangle|^2 = \left| -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probability of measuring 0 is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
