Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow.

The question is about a star that's similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of it. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Photometric observations show brightness variations because the star is rotating, so only one hemisphere is spotted. The key point is that this setup can mimic an exoplanet's signal. The question is, what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet to produce the same brightness variation as the spots, assuming the star wasn't spotted otherwise.

Hmm, wait. So I need to find Rpl/Rstar such that the planet's transit would cause the same change in brightness as the spots do.

First, I should think about how both the spots and the planet affect the observed brightness.

For the star with spots: when the spots are facing us, they make the star appear dimmer. The spots cover 20% of the hemisphere. Since it's one hemisphere, I think the total spotted area is 20% of half the star's surface. Let me see: the star's surface area is 4πR². One hemisphere is 2πR². 20% of that is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So the area covered by spots is 0.4πR².

But wait, each spot is cooler. The star's Teff is 6000 K, spots are 5000 K. The difference is 1000 K. So the brightness of the spots compared to the rest of the star is important.

The flux from the star without spots is based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law: F = σT^4. So when the spots are on the visible side, the total flux is reduced because a fraction of the surface is emitting less.

So the fractional change in brightness when the spots are on view is what we need to calculate. Let's call this ΔF. The maximum variation would occur when the spots are fully visible (i.e., when the star is rotating such that the spotted hemisphere is facing us).

The star's total flux, F_total, when spots are present: the unspotted area emits at F0 = σ*(6000)^4, and the spotted area emits at F_spot = σ*(5000)^4.

So the area without spots is 0.8 * 2πR² (since 20% is spots, 80% is normal). Wait, no, the hemisphere is 2πR². 20% is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So the normal area in the hemisphere is 2πR² - 0.4πR² = 1.6πR².

So the total flux when the spots are visible is:

F = (normal area * F0) + (spot area * F_spot)
= (1.6πR² * σ(6000)^4) + (0.4πR² * σ(5000)^4)

The normal flux (without any spots) would be 2πR² * σ(6000)^4.

So the fractional change is (F - F_normal) / F_normal.

Let me compute this.

Compute F_normal: 2πR² σ (6000)^4.

F_spotty: (1.6 * (6000^4) + 0.4 * (5000^4)) * π R² σ.

Wait, wait. Let me factor out π R² σ.

So F_spotty = π R² σ [1.6*(6000)^4 + 0.4*(5000)^4 ]

F_normal = 2 π R² σ (6000)^4.

So the fractional change ΔF = (F_spotty - F_normal) / F_normal.

Let me compute the numerator:

F_spotty - F_normal = π R² σ [1.6*(6000)^4 + 0.4*(5000)^4 - 2*(6000)^4 ]

= π R² σ [ (1.6 - 2)*6000^4 + 0.4*5000^4 ]

= π R² σ [ (-0.4) *6000^4 + 0.4 *5000^4 ]

= 0.4 π R² σ [ (-6000^4 +5000^4 ) ]

So ΔF = [0.4 π R² σ (5000^4 - 6000^4 ) ] / [2 π R² σ (6000^4 ) ]

Simplify:

The π R² σ terms cancel out.

ΔF = (0.4 / 2) * (5000^4 - 6000^4 ) / (6000^4 )

= 0.2 * (5000^4 - 6000^4 ) / (6000^4 )

Compute the numerical value.

Compute (6000^4)/(5000^4) = (6/5)^4 = (1.2)^4. 1.2^2 is 1.44, so 1.44^2 is 2.0736. So 6000^4 = 2.0736 * 5000^4.

Wait, but I need 5000^4 -6000^4. Hmm, alternatively, compute (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 = (0.8333)^4 ≈ 0.482253.

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute 5000^4 = (5e3)^4 = 625e12, and 6000^4 = 1296e12. Wait, wait—no, let me compute 5000^4:

5000^4 = (5e3)^4 = 5^4 * (1e3)^4 = 625 * 1e12 = 6.25e14.

Similarly, 6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296 *1e12 = 1.296e15.

So 5000^4 = 6.25e14, 6000^4 = 1.296e15.

So 5000^4 -6000^4 = (6.25e14 - 1.296e15 ) = -6.71e14.

So putting that into ΔF:

ΔF = 0.2 * (-6.71e14) / (1.296e15 )

Calculate numerator: 0.2 * (-6.71e14) = -1.342e14.

Divide by denominator 1.296e15: (-1.342e14)/(1.296e15) ≈ -0.10354.

So ΔF ≈ -0.10354, which is a ~10% decrease in brightness when the spots are facing us.

Wait, but wait. If the spots are cooler, the star should appear dimmer when spots are visible. So the fractional change is negative, a decrease.

But when considering the planet transit, the planet blocks some light, causing the same decrease. So the planet's transit would cause a dip in brightness equal to the fractional area blocked multiplied by the brightness per unit area.

But for the planet, the dip in brightness is (Rpl^2 / Rstar^2) * (F_star), because the area blocked is π Rpl^2, and the star's flux is F = σ T_eff^4 per unit area. So the fractional dip is (Rpl^2 / Rstar^2) * (F_planet_blocked / F_total), but wait, no.

Wait, when a planet transits, it blocks a part of the star's disk. The area blocked is π Rpl^2. The total area of the star is π Rstar^2. So the area blocked fraction is (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

But the brightness change is proportional to the area blocked, because each part of the star emits the same flux (assuming uniform temperature, which the star is except for spots). So the dip in brightness is ΔF_planet = -( Rpl^2 / Rstar^2 ) * F_total.

Wait, but in reality, when the planet transits, the observed flux drops by (Rpl^2 / Rstar^2) multiplied by the star's flux per unit area. So if the star's flux is F0, then the drop is (Rpl^2 / Rstar^2) * F0.

But wait, the star's flux is F0 = σ Teff^4. So the dip is (Rpl^2/Rstar^2) * F0.

But in the case of the spotted star, the dip is ΔF ≈ -0.10354 F0.

Wait, but the problem says we want to find the planet radius such that the dip would be the same amplitude. So the magnitude of ΔF_planet should equal the magnitude of ΔF_spot, which is about 0.10354.

So setting:

(Rpl/Rstar)^2 * F0 = 0.10354 F0.

Therefore, Rpl^2/Rstar^2 = 0.10354.

Take square root: Rpl/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.10354) ≈ 0.3218.

Wait, but that's approximately 0.32. Looking at the options, D is ~0.32.

Wait, but wait—hold on, because the problem states that the star has a filling factor of 20% for the spots. But the spots are on one hemisphere. So when the star is rotating, the spots come into view and go out of view. But the maximum dip would be when the spotted hemisphere is fully visible.

Wait, but the maximum dip would be when the entire spotted area is facing us. So for a star with a filling factor of 20% on one hemisphere, when that hemisphere is facing us, the spotted area is 20% of the hemisphere's area, which is 0.2 * (2π R²) / (4π R²)) = 0.1, which is 10% of the star's surface. Wait, wait a second.

Wait, the filling factor is 20%—so the spots cover 20% of the hemisphere. So one hemisphere is 50% of the star's surface. So the spots cover 20% of 50% which is 10% of the total surface. Oh, wait, so the area of the spots is 10% of the star's total surface.

Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. Maybe I made a mistake earlier.

So the star's total surface area is 4π R². The hemisphere is 2π R². The filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, so the spot area is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R².

Which is 0.4π R² / (4π R²) ) = 0.1, which is 10% of the star's surface.

Oh! So earlier I considered the spot area as 0.4π R², which is 10% of the star's surface, so when the hemisphere is facing us, the spots cover 10% of the star's surface.

Wait, this changes things. So the earlier calculation might have an error because I thought the spot area was 0.4π R², but in reality, since the star's total area is 4 π R², 0.4π R² is 10% of that. So when the hemisphere is fully visible, the spots cover 10% of the star's surface. So when the other hemisphere is visible, the spots are on the far side, and thus not affecting the observed flux.

Wait, but the star is rotating, so as the spots rotate into and out of view, the observed flux changes. The maximum dip would be when the maximum amount of spotted area is visible. Since the star is a sphere, when the hemisphere with spots is facing us, the entire 10% of the surface is covered by spots.

Wait, but earlier I thought when the spots are on one hemisphere, and that hemisphere is facing us, then the maximum dip is 10% of the total surface. So why did I earlier calculate a 10% dip? Let me recheck.

Wait, the problem says the star has a radius equal to the Sun, so Rstar is R_sun. The spots have a filling factor of 20% on one hemisphere. So the area of spots is 0.2 * (2π R²) = 0.4π R². The total area is 4π R². So the spot area is 0.4π /4π = 0.1, which is 10% of the star's surface area.

So when the hemisphere with spots is fully visible, 10% of the star's surface is covered by spots.

So the brightness dip due to spots is 10% of the surface, each spot being cooler.

So the fractional dip in flux when the spots are 10% of the surface is:

ΔF = (F_spotted - F_normal) / F_normal.

F_spotted = (0.9 * F0) + (0.1 * F_spot).

So F_spotted = 0.9 F0 + 0.1 F_spot.

F_normal is F0.

So ΔF = (0.9 F0 +0.1 F_spot - F0)/F0 = ( -0.1 F0 + 0.1 F_spot ) / F0 = 0.1 (F_spot - F0 ) / F0.

Compute F_spot / F0 = (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4.

(5/6) is approximately 0.8333. (0.8333)^4.

Let me compute 0.8333^2 = 0.6944. Then squared again: 0.6944^2 ≈ 0.48225. So F_spot / F0 ≈ 0.48225.

So F_spot = 0.48225 F0.

So putting it back into ΔF:

ΔF = 0.1 * (0.48225 - 1) = 0.1 * (-0.51775) = -0.051775.

So the fractional dip is about -5.1775%.

Wait, so about a 5% dip in brightness when the spots are fully visible.

Wait, but earlier with the hemisphere approach, I got a 10% dip. That's conflicting with this new approach. Which one is correct?

Ah, I think I messed up earlier because I was treating it as a hemisphere; but the filling factor is 20% on one hemisphere, which is 10% of the star's total surface. So when the hemisphere is facing us, the 10% of the surface is spotted.

So the correct approach is that the dip is 10% of the surface, each spot at F_spot.

So ΔF is (0.9 F0 + 0.1 F_spot - F0) / F0 = (0.1 (F_spot - F0 )) / F0.

Which is 0.1 (0.48225 -1) = -0.051775 → about -5.18% dip.

Now, for the exoplanet transit, the dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2. Because the planet blocks Rpl^2 / Rstar^2 of the star's area, each part of which emits F0. So the dip is (Rpl^2 / Rstar^2) * F0.

Wait, no. Actually, ΔF_planet = -(Rpl^2 / Rstar^2) * F0.

So the magnitude is (Rpl^2 / Rstar^2) * F0.

We want this to be equal to the dip caused by the spots, which is 5.18% of F0.

So (Rpl/Rstar)^2 * F0 = 0.051775 F0 → (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.051775) ≈ 0.2275.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 0.2275. The options are A)0.39, B)0.07, C)0.11, D)0.32.

Hmm, 0.2275 is about 0.23, which is not an option. So maybe I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I need to reevaluate. Because the star's spotted area is 10% of the surface, but when the hemisphere is facing us, the spots are on the front. But the star is rotating, so the spots come into view and go out of view, causing a periodic brightness variation. When the spot hemisphere is facing us, the dip is maximum.

But perhaps I should model the brightness dip as a function of the filling factor and temperature difference.

Wait, another approach: the maximum dip would be the product of the area of the spots (as a fraction of the star's area) and the difference in brightness per unit area between the spot and the rest of the star.

So, the area fraction is 0.1 (10%). The brightness per unit area of the spot is F_spot = (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.482.

So the fractional dip is 0.1 * (1 - 0.482) = 0.1 * 0.518 ≈ 0.0518, or 5.18% dip.

So the planet's dip should be the same, 5.18%, which is (Rpl^2 / Rstar^2) = 0.0518.

So Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2276. So about 0.23.

But none of the options match this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the area calculation. Let me think again.

The filling factor is 20% on one hemisphere, which is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R². So the fraction of the total area is 0.4π/(4π) = 0.1, which is 10%. So that's correct.

But wait, when the star is viewed such that the hemisphere is facing us, the entire 10% of the surface is covered in spots. So the maximum dip is when the 10% is blocking the most light.

Wait, but perhaps the brightness dip is averaged over the rotation period. Wait, the problem says that the photometric observations show periodic variations in brightness. So the dip occurs when the spots are in view.

But the question says, to produce the same amplitude signal as the spots, what radius should the planet have? So when the planet transits, it causes the same dip as when the spots are in view.

So the planet's dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2. So we set (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.0518 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.227.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, let me re-examine the question. It says the star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. So the spots are at 5000 K. So their brightness is (5000/6000)^4 = 0.48225 times the star's brightness.

So the fractional dip when the spots are fully visible is (0.1) * (1 - 0.48225) = 0.1 * 0.51775 = 0.051775, which is about 5.18% dip.

So the planet's dip should be 5.18% as well. So (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.2276.

But none of the options are near 0.23.

Wait, the options are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

Hmm. 0.23 isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternative approach: perhaps the question is considering the total change caused by the spots as the difference between the two fluxes, like using the average flux change.

Wait, when the star is rotating, the spots come into view and then go out of view. The maximum dip is when all the spots are visible. The minimum is when none are visible. So the amplitude of the brightness variation is the difference between the two.

So the amplitude is (F_max - F_min)/F_avg.

Wait, F_max is when no spots are visible (F0), and F_min is when all spots are visible (F_spotty).

Wait, no, when spots are visible, the flux is lower, so F_min is when spots are visible. So the amplitude is (F_max - F_min) = F0 - F_spotty.

Wait, but F_spotty is the flux when the spots are visible. So F_spotty is less than F0.

Wait, perhaps the amplitude is (F0 - F_spotty) / F0.

Wait, but that's the same as the dip I calculated earlier, 5.18%.

So I'm back to the same problem.

Wait, perhaps the star is only spotty on one hemisphere, so the amount of the surface that is covered when the star rotates is 20% of the hemisphere, which is 0.2 * (2π R²) = 0.4π R². So when that hemisphere is facing us, the 0.4π R² area is covered. So the fraction of the star's surface is 0.4π R² / 4π R² = 0.1, which is 10%.

So the fractional dip is 10% of the area, each spot with F_spot = 0.482 F0.

So the total dip is 0.1 * 0.518 F0, as before.

But perhaps the calculation should be done with the flux from the entire star.

Wait, maybe I should compute the flux when the spots are on the hemisphere:

F = (unspotted area) * F0 + (spotted area) * F_spot.

Unspotted area in the hemisphere: 2π R² * 0.8 = 1.6π R².

Spotted area: 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R².

So F = 1.6π R² * F0 + 0.4π R² * F_spot.

F_normal (without spots) is 2π R² * F0.

So the fractional dip is [ F - F_normal ] / F_normal.

F - F_normal = (1.6 + 0.4 * (F_spot / F0) ) F0 * π R² - 2 π R² F0.

= [ (1.6 F0 + 0.4 F_spot ) - 2 F0 ] * π R².

= [ (1.6 F0 + 0.4 * 0.482 F0 ) - 2 F0 ] * π R².

= [ (1.6 + 0.1928) F0 - 2 F0 ] * π R².

= (1.7928 F0 - 2 F0 ) * π R².

= (-0.2072 F0 ) * π R².

So (F - F_normal) = -0.2072 F0 π R².

F_normal = 2 F0 π R².

So ΔF = (-0.2072 F0 π R²) / (2 F0 π R²) ) = -0.2072 / 2 = -0.1036.

So ΔF ≈ -10.36% dip.

Wait, that's a bigger dip than before. So earlier I thought the dip was 5.18%, but now it's about 10.36%.

Hmm, why the discrepancy? Because perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier.

Wait, let me redo it.

F_spotty = (1.6π R² * F0) + (0.4π R² * F_spot).

F_normal = 2π R² F0.

So F_spotty - F_normal = (1.6 F0 + 0.4 F_spot) π R² - 2 F0 π R².

= (1.6 F0 + 0.4 F_spot - 2 F0) π R².

= ( -0.4 F0 + 0.4 F_spot ) π R².

= 0.4 (F_spot - F0 ) π R².

So ΔF = [0.4 (F_spot - F0 ) π R² ] / [ 2 F0 π R² ]

= 0.4 (F_spot - F0 ) / (2 F0 )

= 0.2 (F_spot/F0 -1 )

F_spot/F0 = (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.48225.

So 0.2 (0.48225 -1 ) = 0.2 ( -0.51775 ) = -0.10355.

So ΔF ≈ -10.355% dip.

Ah, that's about a 10.36% dip.

So that's quite different from the earlier 5.18% dip I calculated. So where was I wrong before?

Earlier, I thought that when the hemisphere is facing us, the spot fraction is 10% of the total surface. So I multiplied 0.1 (area) * (F_spot - F0) → 0.1 * (0.48225 - 1 ) → 0.1 * (-0.51775) ≈ -5.18%. But that's incorrect because the hemisphere is only a part of the star's surface.

Wait, no. The calculation just done shows that when the entire spotted hemisphere is facing us, the dip is about 10.36%.

So why the difference?

Wait, because when the hemisphere is facing us, the entire 10% of the star's surface is spotted, but the calculation done now shows a 10% dip. Wait, no, wait, the dip is 10.36% in this calculation, which is about 10% of the star's flux.

Wait, the initial approach of 10% area and 5% dip was wrong because the area of the hemisphere is 50% of the star, but the spotted area is 20% of that hemisphere (10% of the star's surface). But the calculation just done shows that the dip is about 10.36%, which is about 10% dip.

Wait, so now I'm getting conflicting numbers.

Wait, let me think again. The star's surface is 4π R². The hemisphere is 2π R². The spots cover 20% of the hemisphere, which is 0.4π R². So the fraction of the star's surface area covered by spots is 0.4π R² / 4π R² = 0.1, which is 10%.

So when the entire spotted hemisphere is visible, the fraction of the star's surface that is spotted is 10%.

So the maximum dip would be when 10% of the star's surface is blocked, each spot being at 0.48225 F0.

So the dip is 10% of the star's surface, each emitting 0.48225 F0.

So the total flux when spots are visible is 90% * F0 + 10% * 0.48225 F0.

Which is (0.9 + 0.048225) F0 = 0.948225 F0.

So the dip is F0 - 0.948225 F0 = 0.051775 F0, which is a 5.1775% dip.

Wait, so the dip is 5.18%, not 10.36%. So why did the earlier calculation give me 10.36%?

Ah, I think I messed up the initial calculation. Let me double-check.

In the first approach, F_spotty when the hemisphere is fully visible:

F_spotty = (unspotted area) * F0 + (spotted area) * F_spot.

But in the whole star, when the hemisphere is fully visible, the other hemisphere is completely unspotted. So the unspotted area is the entire other hemisphere (2π R²) plus the unspotted part of the current hemisphere (1.6π R²). No, wait: when the entire hemisphere is visible, the spotted area is 0.4π R², and the rest of the hemisphere (1.6π R²) is unspotted. The other hemisphere (2π R²) is completely unspotted.

Wait, no. Wait, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the entire front hemisphere (2π R²) is what we see. Of that, 0.4π R² is spotted, and 1.6π R² is unspotted. The other hemisphere is not visible.

So the total flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible is:

F_spotty = (1.6π R²) * F0 + (0.4π R²) * F_spot.

But F_normal is the flux when the entire star is at F0, which is 4π R² * F0. But when the hemisphere is visible, we're only seeing 2π R² * F0.

Wait, no, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the total flux is 1.6π R² F0 + 0.4π R² F_spot.

But the normal flux when the entire star is F0 is 4π R² F0. But when we're looking at the star, the flux we receive is F = (area visible) * F0.

Wait, no, the star's total flux is always F = σ Teff^4. But when part of the surface is at a lower temperature, the observed flux is (unspotted area * F0 + spotted area * F_spot) / (total area) × 4π.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to compute the average flux.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the star's total flux when the spots are visible. The star's total flux is F = (unspotted area * F0 + spotted area * F_spot) / (total area) × 4π R².

Wait, no, the star's luminosity is L = 4π R² σ T_eff^4. When part of the surface is cooler, the luminosity is the same because it's the total energy emitted. But the observed flux from Earth depends on which part of the star is visible.

Wait, no. If the star has a cooler spot, the total luminosity actually decreases because part of the surface is emitting less. So the star's total luminosity is L = (area_unspotted * F0 + area_spotted * F_spot) * σ.

Wait, no, the Stefan-Boltzmann law is F = σ T^4. So when part of the star is cooler, the total luminosity is lower. Thus, the star's L becomes L = (4π R² - area_spotted) * F0 + area_spotted * F_spot.

But when we observe the star, the observed flux is the same as the total flux if the star is a perfect sphere and we're looking at it from a distance. Wait, no, when the star is a sphere, the observed flux is the same as the total luminosity divided by 4π (because flux is L/(4π r²), where r is distance). So, regardless of the spots, the observed flux is L/(4π r²).

Wait, this is a key point. So when the star has spots, the total luminosity is lower, so the observed flux is lower, irrespective of the rotation.

But the question is about photometric variations due to rotation. So when the spots rotate into and out of view, the observed flux changes.

Ah, so the observed flux is not the same as the total luminosity, because you're seeing a portion of the star's surface, depending on its rotation.

Wait, no. No, that's not correct. The observed flux is the sum of the flux from all the parts of the star visible from Earth. So when the star is rotating, different parts of the surface come into view. So if a spot is on the far side, it doesn't contribute. Only when it's on the near side does it affect the flux.

So the brightness variation is due to the changing amount of spotted area in the hemisphere facing us.

So when the star is rotating, the observed flux is the sum of the flux from the visible hemisphere, which may include some spotted regions.

So the maximum dip occurs when the entire spotted hemisphere is facing us, meaning 10% of the star's surface is spotted.

Wait, wait. The star's surface is 4π R². The hemisphere is 2π R². The spots cover 20% of the hemisphere, which is 0.4π R². So when the hemisphere is facing us, the area of the star we see is 2π R². Of that, 0.4π R² is spotted. So the fraction of the star's surface that's spotted when the hemisphere is facing us is 0.4π / (4π) )= 0.1, which is 10% of the total surface.

Wait, but when the star is viewed from Earth, we're seeing the hemisphere. So the total flux when that hemisphere is spotted is:

F = (unspotted area in hemisphere * F0 + spotted area in hemisphere * F_spot) / (hemisphere area) × (hemisphere area) ?

Wait, maybe it's better to compute the observed flux as the sum of the flux from the visible hemisphere.

When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the visible area is 2π R². Of that, 0.4π R² is spotted.

So the flux from the visible hemisphere is:

F_visible = (2π R² - 0.4π R²) * F0 + 0.4π R² * F_spot.

= (1.6 π R² F0) + (0.4 π R² F_spot).

The normal flux (no spots) would be 2π R² F0.

So the dip is F_visible - F_normal = 0.4 π R² (F_spot - F0).

F_normal = 2π R² F0.

So ΔF = (0.4 (F_spot - F0) π R² ) / (2 F0 π R² ) )

= 0.2 ( (F_spot - F0) / F0 )

= 0.2 ( (5000/6000)^4 - 1 )

= 0.2 ( (5/6)^4 -1 )

= 0.2 ( 0.48225 -1 )

= 0.2 * (-0.51775) → -0.10355.

So ΔF ≈ -0.10355, which is a ~10.36% dip.

But wait, I'm getting conflicting results. Earlier, when I thought the dip was 10% of the surface and 0.48225 F0, I thought the dip was 5.18%. But now, when calculating correctly, it's about a 10% dip.

Ah, I think the confusion arises from whether the 20% filling factor is per hemisphere, and whether the star's average brightness is considered.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the maximum dip as the difference between when the spotted hemisphere is fully visible and when it's not.

So when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is:

F_spotty_visible = (unspotted area in hemisphere) * F0 + (spotted area in hemisphere) * F_spot.

= 1.6 π R² F0 + 0.4 π R² F_spot.

When the star is viewed from Earth, the flux is F = (unspotted area * F0 + spotted area * F_spot) / (hemisphere area) × (hemisphere area).

Wait, no. The flux is the sum of the flux from each area. So F = (unspotted area) * F0 + (spotted area) * F_spot.

The unspotted area is 1.6 π R², and spotted is 0.4 π R².

The normal flux (without spots) when the hemisphere is visible is 2 π R² F0.

So the dip is [ (1.6 F0 + 0.4 F_spot ) - 2 F0 ] / (2 F0 )

= [ (1.6 F0 + 0.4 * 0.48225 F0 ) - 2 F0 ] / (2 F0 )

= [ (1.6 + 0.1929 ) F0 - 2 F0 ] / (2 F0 )

= (1.7929 F0 - 2 F0 ) / 2 F0

= (-0.2071 F0 ) / 2 F0

= -0.10355 → ~-10.36% dip.

So the dip in brightness is about 10.36% when the spotted hemisphere is facing us.

So the planet's dip should be the same, 10.36%.

So (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.1036.

Rpl/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.1036) ≈ 0.322.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32.

So the answer should be D) ~0.32.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star, we analyze the photometric effects caused by the spots and the planet.

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: Equal to the Sun's radius, \( R_{\text{star}} \).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - Spots cover 20% of one hemisphere, with a temperature difference of \( \Delta T = 1000 \, \text{K} \) (spots at \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \)).

2. **Fractional Brightness Change Due to Spots**:
   - The star's total surface area is \( 4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \). One hemisphere has an area of \( 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \), and the spots cover 20% of this hemisphere, corresponding to an area of \( 0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \). Thus, the spotted area is 10% of the star's total surface area.
   - The flux from the star without spots is \( F_0 = \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \). The flux from the spots is \( F_{\text{spot}} = \sigma T_{\text{spot}}^4 \).
   - The fractional brightness change when the spotted hemisphere is fully visible is:
     \[
     \Delta F = \frac{(F_{\text{unspotted}} + F_{\text{spot}}) - F_{\text{normal}}}{F_{\text{normal}}}
     \]
     where:
     \[
     F_{\text{unspotted}} = 0.9 F_0, \quad F_{\text{spot}} = 0.4 F_{\text{spot}} F_0, \quad F_{\text{normal}} = F_0.
     \]
     Substituting:
     \[
     \Delta F = \frac{(0.9 F_0 + 0.1 F_{\text{spot}}) - F_0}{F_0} = 0.1 \left( \frac{F_{\text{spot}}}{F_0} - 1 \right).
     \]
     Using \( \frac{F_{\text{spot}}}{F_0} = \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 = \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \approx 0.48225 \):
     \[
     \Delta F = 0.1 (0.48225 - 1) = -0.10355 \, \text{or} \, -10.36\%.
     \]

3. **Exoplanet Brightness Variation**:
   - A planet transiting the star blocks a fraction of the star's light proportional to its area:
     \[
     \Delta F_{\text{planet}} = -\left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 F_0.
     \]
   - To match the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots, set:
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.1036.
     \]
   - Solving for \( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \):
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.1036} \approx 0.322.
     \]

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet, relative to the host star, is approximately \( 0.32 \). This matches option **D**.
