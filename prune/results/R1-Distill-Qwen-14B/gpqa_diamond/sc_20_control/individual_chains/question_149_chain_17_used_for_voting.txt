Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here about a peptidic compound. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to figure it out step by step.

The question says that the 1H NMR of the crude compound looks mostly as expected, except for two peaks that are the same alpha-proton. Both have similar shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. So, the integral suggests that it's one proton split into two. And the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. So it's not like a doublet of doublets or something because the question says that's ruled out.

Wait, so if it's the same alpha-proton, why are there two peaks? Maybe something to do with diastereotopic protons or some kind of symmetry breaking. Oh wait, diastereotopic protons are equivalent when you have certain stereoisomers, but if they're not equivalent, each would give a separate peak. But wait, in this case, the integral adds up to 1H, so perhaps each peak is 0.5H, so double peaks for one proton. But why?

Wait, the question says that the two peaks have the same integral. So each integrates to 0.5, adding to 1. So maybe the proton is split into two due to coupling, but the coupling pattern is something else.

Wait, but the problem states that the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. So it's not a normal splitting between two protons. Maybe it's a more unusual coupling scenario. Or perhaps the issue isn't about splitting, but about the presence of two different environments.

Then, the LC-MS analysis shows two peaks with the same mass. So both are the same mass, and same m/z, but are separate in the chromatogram. So the same molecular weight, but two different things. So they could be enantiomers or diastereomers because they have same molecular weight but different structures.

Wait, if the LC-MS shows two peaks, that suggests two different compounds, but with same mass. So maybe they're diastereomers or enantiomers. Because enantiomers have same mass, same retention time on chiral columns? Or wait, no, on a regular column, they might elute at same time, but on a chiral column, they might separate. But the question says LC-MS at elevated temperature. Hmm, maybe that's causing something else.

Wait, the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton. So if the molecule is a mixture of diastereomers, that could cause different environments for the same proton. Wait, but each diastereomer would have a different structure, so in each, the alpha proton would be in a different environment, leading to different shifts. But why two peaks with similar shifts?

Alternatively, maybe it's about a mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers have identical NMR spectra because they're mirror images, so same shifts. Wait, but the question says the NMR has two peaks for the same alpha proton. So if it's racemic, the NMR would look normal. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, but wait. If the compound is a mixture of diastereomers, each would have a different environment, so the same proton in each would split into two. So maybe that's why the NMR shows two peaks. Also, the LC-MS would show two peaks because they're different compounds.

But what about the possibility of the same compound having different conformers? But I think that would be too broad or not split the peaks. Also, in the question, the two peaks have the same mass.

Wait, what about the possibility of double coupling in the synthesis? The options include option C, which is about double coupling during an amide bond formation. Amide bonds are formed via reactions like coupling reagents, where sometimes you can get side reactions. So, during the formation of an amide, could you get a situation where a doublet forms, but in a way that leads to two signals for the same proton? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe during the amide bond formation, a double bond forms with some coupling that causes the alpha protons to be split into two. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, the question says that the two peaks are from the same alpha-proton. So if the compound is a diastereomer, the same proton in each diastereomer would have different environments, so each would have its own peak. But if the mixture is 50:50, then the integrals would add up to 1H, which matches the question. So the NMR would show two peaks for the same proton but in different environments.

But wait, diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR peaks would differ. So the two peaks would have different shifts, but the question says the two peaks have similar chemical shifts. So that might not fit. Unless the diastereomers are very similar, or the environment is almost the same for the alpha proton, leading to nearly identical shifts.

Another option is that the compound is a mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers have the same physical properties, so the NMR would not show separate peaks. But in the case of enantiomers, the overall NMR would appear the same. So that would not cause two peaks for the same proton. Unless... maybe because of some coupling with another chiral center? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, but the LC-MS shows two peaks of same mass. So if the compound is a racemic mixture, you would only see one peak in the LC-MS because the retention time is the same. But if the LC is run on a chiral column, then enantiomers would separate. But the question doesn't specify that. So in normal HPLC, which is achiral, enantiomers elute together, so you'd see a single peak. So the presence of two peaks with same mass suggests they are diastereomers, not enantiomers.

So the crude compound is a mix of diastereomers. So answer D.

Wait, but let me double-check. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so in NMR, the same proton in each would appear as separate peaks. But in the NMR, the two peaks have similar shifts. So maybe the diastereomers are such that the alpha proton's environment is almost the same, leading to similar shifts but two separate peaks. Also, their integrals add up to 1H, which makes sense if the mixture is 50:50.

In the LC-MS, each diastereomer would have a different retention time but same mass, leading to two peaks. So that fits.

What about the other options. Option A: contaminated with a precursor. The LC-MS would show a peak for the main compound and another for the precursor. But the main compound's mass would be higher, perhaps. Or maybe the same. Wait, no, the precursor would be the previous step in synthesis, which would have a lower mass. So if the main product is expected, a peak at higher mass would be the product, and a lower mass would be the precursor.

But in the question, both peaks have same mass as the expected, so option A is less likely.

Option C: double coupling during amide formation. I'm not too familiar, but amide bonds are formed via coupling reactions. Could that lead to two different products with same mass but different structures? Like, perhaps, if two different bonds are formed, but I don't think that would make diastereomers. It might lead to different byproducts, perhaps, but same mass? Or maybe a different regiochemistry? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, the question says that the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton. So maybe the amide bond formation led to a situation where the alpha proton is split into two because of some coupling. But the coupling isn't spin-spin because the coupling pattern rules that out. So maybe it's something else, like a J coupling with a different proton.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction led to a double bond or something else that affects the proton. I'm not certain.

But the LC-MS part showing two peaks of same mass but different structures (diastereomers) seems to fit with option D. Also, the NMR showing two peaks for the same alpha-proton because they're in different environments due to diastereomers.

So putting it all together, the most likely answer is D: the compound is a mixture of diastereoisomers.

The question involves analyzing a peptidic compound based on its 1H NMR and LC-MS data. The NMR spectrum shows two peaks corresponding to the same alpha-proton, with similar chemical shifts, equal integrals (summing to 1H), and a coupling pattern that rules out spin-spin coupling. The LC-MS analysis reveals two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass, consistent with the expected molecule.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: The compound is contaminated with a precursor**  
   A precursor would typically have a different mass (lower than the expected product). However, the LC-MS data shows two peaks with the same mass as the expected product, ruling out contamination with a precursor.  

2. **Option B: The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers**  
   Enantiomers are mirror images of each other and have identical physical properties, including NMR spectra. If the compound were a racemic mixture, the NMR would show a single peak for the alpha-proton, not two separate peaks. Additionally, LC-MS would show a single peak for enantiomers on an achiral column. Thus, this option is inconsistent with the data.  

3. **Option C: 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction**  
   While double coupling could theoretically lead to two peaks for the same proton, the question explicitly states that the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. Furthermore, double coupling during synthesis would likely result in byproducts with different masses, which is not observed in the LC-MS data. This makes this option unlikely.  

4. **Option D: The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers**  
   Diastereoisomers have different physical properties and can give rise to separate peaks in both NMR and LC-MS. In the NMR, the same alpha-proton in each diastereomer would experience slightly different chemical environments, leading to two peaks with similar shifts. The integrals of these peaks would add up to 1H if the mixture is 50:50. In LC-MS, the two diastereoisomers would have the same mass but different retention times, producing two peaks of equal intensity. This explanation aligns well with the observations.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation for the observed data is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.
