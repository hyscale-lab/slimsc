Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's try to unpack it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll take it slow.

The question is about measuring two observables, P and Q, in a system. The system's state at time t is given as a column vector (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait, I think I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state vector usually has to be normalized. Oh, right, the sum of the squares of the absolute values of its components should equal 1. Let me check that. So (-1)^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, and 1^2 is 1. Adding them gives 6. Oh, that can't be right because it's 6, not 1. So I guess I need to normalize the state vector first. So the normalization factor would be 1 over the square root of 6. So the state vector becomes ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T.

Wait, but maybe the problem assumes the state is already normalized? Let's read the question again. It says the state has elements (-1, 2, 1). Oh, right, the problem doesn't mention anything about normalization, so perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that it's already normalized. Wait, but when I calculate the sum, it's 1 +4 +1 =6, which isn't 1. So I definitely need to normalize it. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are supposed to be unit vectors. So I'll proceed by normalizing the state.

Wait, but maybe the problem is using a different approach. Let me think. The state vector is given as [ -1; 2; 1 ], so the norm squared is 1^2 + 2^2 +1^2 =6. So the normalized vector would be (1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6)).

Now, the question involves measuring P and then Q. We're asked about the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. Wait, no, wait. Let me read again. The question says "the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements." So first, you measure P, get 0, then measure Q, get -1. So it's a sequence of two measurements.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable, the state collapses into an eigenstate of that observable. So the order of measurements matters. So first, measuring P, then Q. So the state after the first measurement (P) will be an eigenstate of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. Then, measuring Q on that new state.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. When you make the first measurement of P, the system collapses into an eigenstate of P. Then, the second measurement of Q is done on this new state.

So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Normalize the initial state.

2. Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.

3. Find the eigenvector(s) of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0, because the first measurement yields 0.

4. Project the initial state onto this eigenvector of P. The probability of getting 0 when measuring P is the square of the norm of this projection.

5. Then, given that the state is in this eigenvector of P, measure Q. Find the eigenvalues of Q, and find the probability of getting -1 in this scenario.

Wait, but the question is about the joint probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. So the process is: the initial state is |ψ⟩. You measure P, get 0, so the state collapses into |p0⟩ (eigenvector of P with eigenvalue 0), then measure Q on |p0⟩, getting -1. The probability is the product of the probability of getting 0 in P and then -1 in Q, given that P was 0. Or perhaps it's the probability that the initial state |ψ⟩, when first measured for P and then for Q, yields 0 and -1 respectively.

Alternatively, since P and Q might not commute, the order matters, and the overall probability is the product of the probabilities in sequence.

So, the plan is:

- Compute the probability of measuring P=0, then, from that state, compute the probability of measuring Q=-1.

But first, let's get the eigenvectors and eigenvalues for P and Q.

Let me first look at operator P. Its matrix is:

Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2).

Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

Hmm, so it's a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it as:

[ [ 0, 1/√2, 0 ],
  [1/√2, 0,1/√2],
  [0, 1/√2, 0 ] ]

I need to find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Wait, perhaps this matrix is symmetric, so it should have real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors. Let me see.

Yes, because the matrix is equal to its transpose.

So, to find the eigenvalues, I can solve the characteristic equation det(P - λ I) = 0.

The matrix P - λ I would be:

[ -λ, 1/√2, 0 ]

[1/√2, -λ,1/√2 ]

[ 0, 1/√2, -λ ]

The determinant of this matrix is a bit involved, but perhaps we can find a pattern or maybe guess the eigenvalues.

Wait, perhaps the matrix is block diagonal? Let me see. The (2,2) element is -λ, and the other elements in row 2 and column 2 might form a symmetric structure.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find a pattern or make an educated guess.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to guess eigenvalues. Let me think: for λ = 1, does the matrix become singular?

Another approach: perhaps to perform row or column operations to simplify the determinant.

But maybe it's easier to consider that the matrix is a tridiagonal matrix with zeros on the diagonal except for the middle element which is -λ.

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to think of it as a 3x3 matrix and compute the determinant.

Alternatively, maybe the matrix P can be written as a sum of other matrices. But perhaps it's easier to compute the determinant.

The determinant of a 3x3 matrix:

| a b c |
| d e f |
| g h i |

is a(ei − fh) − b(di − fg) + c(dh − eg).

So applying this to P - λ I:

a = -λ, b=1/√2, c=0.

d=1/√2, e=-λ, f=1/√2.

g=0, h=1/√2, i=-λ.

The determinant would be:

-λ [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] - (1/√2)[ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ] + 0 * [ ... ].

So:

-λ [ λ² - (1/2) ] - (1/√2) [ (-λ/√2) - 0 ) ] + 0.

= -λ (λ² - 1/2 ) + (1/√2)( λ /√2 )

Simplify:

- λ^3 + (λ/2) + (λ/2) )

Wait, let me compute each term:

First term: (-λ) * (λ^2 - (1/√2 * 1/√2)) → λ^2 is because (1/√2)^2 is 1/2. So first term is (-λ)(λ² - 1/2) = -λ^3 + (λ/2).

Second term: -(1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) ) ] → because the other term in the minor is (1/√2)(0) which is 0.

Wait, the term is:

- (1/√2) * [ (d i - f g) ]

Wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake in the determinant expansion.

Wait, the determinant is:

a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg).

So for a=-λ, b=1/√2, c=0.

d=1/√2, e=-λ, f=1/√2.

g=0, h=1/√2, i=-λ.

So:

a(ei - fh) → (-λ) [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ]

= (-λ) [ λ² - (1/2) ) ]

= (-λ)(λ² - 1/2) = -λ^3 + (λ/2).

Then, -b(di - fg) → - (1/√2) [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ]

= - (1/√2) [ (-λ/√2) - 0 ) ] 

= - (1/√2)( -λ/√2 ) 

= (1/√2)( λ/√2 ) 

= λ/(2) 

Because (1/√2)(1/√2) = 1/2.

Third term, c(...), which is 0, so it doesn't contribute.

So the determinant is (-λ^3 + λ/2) + (λ/2) ) = -λ^3 + λ.

So, the equation is -λ^3 + λ = 0.

Factor: λ (-λ² +1 ) =0 → λ(1 - λ² )=0, so λ=0, λ=1, λ=-1.

So the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, and -1.

Hmm, that's interesting. So P has eigenvalues 0, 1, and -1.

Wait, that's a helpful result. So when measuring P, possible outcomes are 0, 1, -1.

Now, the next step is to find the eigenvectors for each of these eigenvalues.

But perhaps for this problem, I'm only interested in the eigenvector corresponding to λ=0, since the first measurement is P=0.

So let's find the eigenvector for λ=0.

The matrix P - 0 * I is just P.

So P:

Row 1: 0  1/√2  0

Row 2: 1/√2 0  1/√2

Row 3: 0  1/√2 0

We can write (P - 0 I) |v> = 0.

So the equations are:

0*v1 + (1/√2)v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → v2 = 0.

(1/√2)v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2)v3 =0 → v1 + v3 =0 → v1 = -v3.

0*v1 + (1/√2)v2 + 0*v3 =0 → same as first equation, v2=0.

So from the first equation, v2=0. From the second equation, v1 = -v3.

So the eigenvector can be written as [v1, 0, v3]^T, with v1 = -v3.

So, let me choose v3 = a, then v1 = -a. So the eigenvector is (-a, 0, a)^T.

We can choose a=1 for simplicity, so the eigenvector is (-1, 0, 1)^T. Alternatively, any scalar multiple, but we can normalize it.

The norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 0^2 +1^2 ) = sqrt(2), so the normalized eigenvector is ( -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) )^T.

Wait, but another approach is to consider that the eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional. So the eigenvectors are scalar multiples of this vector.

So, the eigenvector |p0> is ( -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) )^T.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me double-check the equations.

Wait, when λ=0, the equations are:

Equation 1: (1/√2) v2 = 0 → v2=0.

Equation 2: (1/√2) v1 + (1/√2) v3 =0 → v1 = -v3.

Equation3: (1/√2) v2=0 → same as equation1, v2=0.

So yes, the solution is v2=0, v1 = -v3. So the eigenvector is (-v3, 0, v3), which can be written as v3*( -1, 0, 1 ), so as a vector, it's proportional to (-1,0,1), and normalized gives (-1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)).

So, the eigenvector for P=0 is this vector.

Now, the initial state is |ψ> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T, but wait, wait, earlier I thought it wasn't normalized. Let me recheck.

The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1+4+1=6. So the normalized state is ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T.

So, to find the probability of measuring P=0, we calculate the inner product of |ψ> with |p0>, then take the square of the absolute value.

So, the inner product is:

( -1/sqrt(6) ) * (-1/sqrt(2)) ) + (2/sqrt(6)) * 0 + (1/sqrt(6)) * (1/sqrt(2)) )

= [ (1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ) ] + 0 + [ (1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ]

= [ 1/(sqrt(12)) ) + 1/(sqrt(12)) ]

= 2/(sqrt(12)).

Simplify sqrt(12) = 2*sqrt(3), so 2/(2*sqrt(3)) ) = 1/sqrt(3).

The absolute value squared is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.

So the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.

Now, upon measuring P=0, the state collapses into |p0>, which is (-1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)).

Now, we measure Q on this state. The operator Q is given by the matrix:

Row 1: 1, 0, 0.

Row 2: 0, 0, 0.

Row3: 0,0,-1.

So, the matrix for Q is diagonal: [1, 0, -1] on the diagonal.

So the eigenvalues of Q are 1, 0, and -1.

Wait, because the diagonal entries are the eigenvalues. So eigenvalues are 1 (for first basis vector), 0 (second), and -1 (third).

So, if the state after P=0 is |p0> = (-1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)).

Wait, no, wait. |p0> is a normalized vector. Let me write it as:

|p0> = ( -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) )^T.

Now, to measure Q, we need to express this state in terms of the eigenstates of Q.

Because Q is diagonal, its eigenstates are the standard basis vectors.

So, the eigenstates of Q are:

|q1> = (1, 0, 0)^T, with eigenvalue 1.

|q0> = (0,1,0)^T, eigenvalue 0.

|q-1> = (0,0,1)^T, eigenvalue -1.

So, any state can be written as a linear combination of these.

Our state after measuring P=0 is |p0> = (-1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)).

So, let's compute the components along each eigenstate of Q.

The component along |q1> is the inner product of |p0> with |q1>, which is (-1/sqrt(2)) *1 + 0 + (1/sqrt(2))*0 = -1/sqrt(2).

Similarly, the component along |q0> is 0 (since the middle component of |p0> is 0).

The component along |q-1> is (1/sqrt(2)) *1 + 0 + 0 = 1/sqrt(2).

The probabilities are the squares of the magnitudes of these components.

Wait, but wait. The state |p0> is already a vector. So, the projection onto each eigenstate is:

For Q eigenvalue 1: the coefficient is the first component of |p0>, which is -1/sqrt(2). The probability is (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

For Q eigenvalue 0: the coefficient is 0, so probability zero.

For Q eigenvalue -1: the third component is 1/sqrt(2), probability (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because when we have |p0>, the state is a normalized vector, so the sum of probabilities should be 1.

Indeed, 1/2 (for 1) + 0 (for 0) +1/2 (for -1) sums to 1. So that checks out.

But wait, the state |p0> is ( -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) ), which is an equal superposition of |q1> and |q-1>, each with amplitude 1/sqrt(2) and -1/sqrt(2), respectively.

So when we measure Q, the possible outcomes are 1, 0, -1.

Wait, but the state |p0> has zero component in the |q0> direction (since the middle component is zero), so the probability of measuring Q=0 is zero.

Wait, but the options given are A) 1/2, B)1/3, C)2/3, D)1/6.

Wait, but the question is about getting Q=-1 after P=0.

So the probability of getting Q=-1 is 1/2.

So, the overall probability is the product of the two probabilities: P=0 (1/3) and then Q=-1 (1/2). So 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

Wait, but that would be option D: 1/6.

But wait, let me think again. Because the problem says that after measuring P=0, the state is |p0>, and then when measuring Q, the probability of getting -1 is 1/2, as we calculated.

So the joint probability is (1/3) * (1/2) )=1/6.

So the answer would be D) 1/6.

Wait, but wait another thing. Because when you measure P=0, the state is |p0>, which is a normalized vector. Then measuring Q on |p0> gives outcomes with certain probabilities.

But wait, is |p0> the only eigenvector for P=0? Because sometimes, an observable can have a degenerate eigenvalue, but in this case, P has eigenvalues 0, 1, -1, each non-degenerate, so the eigenvectors are unique up to scaling.

So yes, the state after P=0 is |p0>, and when measuring Q, the probability to get -1 is 1/2.

So the joint probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

So the correct option is D) 1/6.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves measuring two observables, \( P \) and \( Q \), for a quantum system. The initial state of the system is given as \( | \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \), which is not normalized. The norm is calculated as \( \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6} \), so the normalized state is:

\[
| \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of \( P \)
The operator \( P \) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\ 
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

To find the eigenvalues, the characteristic equation \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \) is solved. The eigenvalues are found to be \( \lambda = 0, 1, -1 \). For \( \lambda = 0 \), the eigenvector is determined by solving \( (P - 0I)|v\rangle = 0 \), leading to the eigenvector:

\[
|p_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Probability of Measuring \( P = 0 \)
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is the square of the overlap between \( | \psi \rangle \) and \( |p_0\rangle \). The inner product is:

\[
\langle p_0 | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
P(P=0) = \left| \langle p_0 | \psi \rangle \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Step 3: State After Measuring \( P = 0 \)
If \( P = 0 \) is measured, the state collapses to \( |p_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \).

### Step 4: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of \( Q \)
The operator \( Q \) is represented by the diagonal matrix:

\[
Q = \begin{bmatrix} 
1 & 0 & 0 \\ 
0 & 0 & 0 \\ 
0 & 0 & -1 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( Q \) are \( 1, 0, -1 \), with corresponding eigenvectors \( |q_1\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \), \( |q_0\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \), and \( |q_{-1}\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \).

### Step 5: Probability of Measuring \( Q = -1 \) After \( P = 0 \)
The state \( |p_0\rangle \) is expressed in terms of the eigenstates of \( Q \):

\[
|p_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} |q_1\rangle + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} |q_{-1}\rangle.
\]

The probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) is the square of the amplitude of \( |q_{-1}\rangle \) in \( |p_0\rangle \):

\[
P(Q=-1) = \left| \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 6: Joint Probability
The joint probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is the product of the two probabilities:

\[
P(P=0, Q=-1) = P(P=0) \cdot P(Q=-1) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is \( \frac{1}{6} \).
