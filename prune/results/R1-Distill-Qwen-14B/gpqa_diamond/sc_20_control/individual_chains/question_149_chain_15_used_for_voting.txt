Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think it out.

The question is about a synthesized peptidic compound. The 1H NMR is mostly as expected, except there are two peaks for the same alpha-proton. Both peaks have similar shifts and integrate together to 1H. So, it's like the same proton is splitting into two. But the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling as a cause. Hmm, what else could cause two peaks for the same proton?

Wait, in NMR, if a proton is split into multiple peaks, it's usually due to coupling with neighboring protons. But the question says they ruled that out. So maybe it's something else. Contamination is option A, but the peaks integrate to 1H, so it's not like an impurity adding extra protons. Plus, the LC-MS data would probably show a new mass if it were a different compound. The LC-MS shows two peaks with the same mass, so same molecular weight. So maybe it's not a precursor because a precursor would have a higher mass, I think.

Option B is enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images, so in NMR, they would show the same chemical shifts because the environments are identical. Wait, but then why two peaks? Because the compound is a racemic mixture, but in NMR, it wouldn't split the peaks because the coupling is between the same types of protons. Unless... Wait, no, enantiomers don't split each other's NMR signals because the environment is the same for each proton. So if it's a racemic mix, the NMR would look the same as a pure sample because the protons are in equivalent environments. So B might not explain the NMR issue.

Option C is 'double coupling' during an amide bond formation. I'm not exactly sure what that means. Maybe during the reaction, some kind of coupling happened, leading to multiple bonds or something. Or perhaps it's about diastereomers. Wait, double coupling might refer to a situation where a hydrogen is coupled with two different sets of equivalent protons, or maybe something else. Not sure yet.

Option D is a mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR signals would split. Let's think about it. If there are diastereomers, each would have different environments for the alpha protons. But wait, in the NMR, the same alpha proton is splitting into two. So perhaps the molecule has a stereocenter adjacent to the alpha proton. If two diastereomers are present, each would have different shifts for that proton. So in a mixture, you'd see two separate peaks for the same proton in each isomer.

Wait, but the question says the peaks have similar shifts. Diastereomers would have some different shifts, but maybe not extremely different, so similar chemical shifts. Also, the integrals together add up to 1H, so each isomer contributes 1H. So that makes sense.

Looking at the LC-MS data: two peaks of same mass. If it's diastereomers, they would have the same molecular weight. So the same mass would make sense because they are constitutional isomers or stereoisomers. But wait, diastereomers have different physical properties, so they would elute at different times in LC, which fits the two peaks. Same mass because same molecular formula.

Wait, but why would diastereomers give the same mass? Oh yes, because they have the same molecular formula. So if the crude compound is a mix of diastereomers, you'd see two peaks in LC-MS, same mass, same NMR except for certain signals.

So the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton, which is because the mixture has two diastereomers where that proton has a slightly different environment in each. So each diastereomer contributes its own peak for that proton.

Wait, but the question says the NMR peaks have similar shifts. Diastereomers might have shifts that are somewhat similar but not identical. So the two peaks would be close but not the same.

Putting it together: the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton because of diastereomers. The LC-MS shows two peaks of same mass because it's two diastereomers. So option D seems to fit.

Option C is about double coupling during amide formation. I'm trying to think what that would mean. Maybe if two different amide bonds formed, but that might lead to a different structure, not just splitting the NMR signal. Or perhaps it's about some coupling that leads to a doublet of doublets, but the question says that coupling isn't the issue because the coupling pattern rules that out.

So, I think the correct answer is D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.

The question involves analyzing a peptidic compound where the 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton, with similar chemical shifts and equal integrals (together integrating to 1H). The LC-MS analysis reveals two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass, consistent with the expected molecule. The task is to determine the most likely explanation for these observations.

1. **Option A (Contamination with a precursor):** This is unlikely because a precursor would have a different mass, and the LC-MS data shows two peaks with the same mass as the expected molecule. Additionally, the NMR peaks integrate to 1H, ruling out an impurity contributing extra protons.

2. **Option B (Enantiomers):** Enantiomers are mirror images and would have identical NMR signals because the chemical environment for each proton is the same. Therefore, a racemic mixture would not produce two distinct peaks for the same proton, making this option inconsistent with the NMR data.

3. **Option C ('Double coupling' during amide-bond formation):** While "double coupling" could theoretically lead to multiple peaks, the question explicitly states that spin-spin coupling has been ruled out as the cause. This makes this option less plausible.

4. **Option D (Mixture of diastereoisomers):** Diastereoisomers have different physical properties, including NMR chemical shifts, due to differences in their spatial arrangements. If the crude compound is a mixture of diastereoisomers, the alpha-proton would experience slightly different chemical environments in each isomer, leading to two distinct NMR peaks for the same proton. The LC-MS data supports this explanation because diastereoisomers have the same molecular formula and thus the same mass, but they would elute at different times in LC, producing two peaks of equal intensity.

Given the NMR and LC-MS data, the most plausible explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.
