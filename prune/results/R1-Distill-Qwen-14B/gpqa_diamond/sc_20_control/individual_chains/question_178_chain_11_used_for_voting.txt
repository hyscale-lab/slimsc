Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about a Lagrangian given by L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, where σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. The question is asking what the mass dimension of κ is and whether the theory is renormalizable. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum field theory, the mass dimension of a coupling constant is important for determining renormalizability. The theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have mass dimensions that are non-negative, I think. Or wait, no, maybe it's that the interaction term in the Lagrangian must have a mass dimension less than or equal to 4 because the Lagrangian density has mass dimension 4 in 4 spacetime dimensions. Right, because the action is dimensionless, and the integral over d^4x (which is dimension 4) requires that the Lagrangian has dimension 4.

So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4. So for L_int, which is the interaction term, each term in it must have mass dimension 4. Let me break down each part of the term to find the dimension of κ.

The term is κ times ψ̄ times σ_{μν} times ψ times F^{μν}.

Let me recall the mass dimensions of the fields involved. Fermion fields ψ have mass dimension 3/2 each because in 4D spacetime, fermions are spin-1/2 and their fields have [ψ]_M = 3/2. The field strength tensor F is for electromagnetism, so it's a field strength tensor, which has dimension 2. Because the gauge field A has dimension 1, and F is the derivative of A, so ∂A is dimension 1 + 1 = 2.

So putting that together:

Each ψ̄ and ψ contributes 3/2 each, so together that's 3/2 * 2 = 3.

F^{μν} contributes 2.

So the product ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν} would have a dimension of 3 (from the fermion fields) + 2 (from F) = 5? Wait, but σ_{μν} is a product of gamma matrices. The structure σ_{μν} is made of γ matrices, and each γ is dimensionless because they're just matrices, not fields. So σ_{μν} doesn't contribute any mass dimension. So the dimension of the term without κ is 3 + 2 = 5.

Wait, but the interaction term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4. So the entire L_int term (which is κ times all the other stuff) must have dimension 4. So the dimension of κ times the other terms (which is 5) must equal 4. So [κ] + 5 = 4 → [κ] = 4-5 = -1. So the mass dimension of κ is -1.

So the first part of the question is answered: κ has mass dimension -1. That would rule out options B and D, which say the dimension is +1.

Now, the second part: is the theory renormalizable? Well, I remember that a theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have mass dimension ≤ 4 - D, where D is the spacetime dimension. Wait, let me think again. In 4 dimensions, each coupling in the interaction term must have mass dimension ≥ 0. Because the Lagrangian must have dimension 4, and each term in it is a product of fields and coupling constants. So if the coupling has dimension negative, that means the term is nonrenormalizable.

Wait, no, I think that's the opposite. Let me get this right. When the coupling has a negative mass dimension, that means when you compute the term, you have to include higher and higher order terms, which makes the theory nonrenormalizable because you can't have a finite number of terms in the perturbation expansion. So in this case, κ has dimension -1. That's negative. So the interaction term has a coupling with a negative dimension, which would make the theory nonrenormalizable.

Wait, no, let me think again. The dimension of the coupling is [κ] = -1. So when you have a term in the Lagrangian like κ φ^3, then each φ has dimension 1 (for a scalar). So [φ]^3 = 3, and [κ] + 3 = [Lagrangian term] = 4. So [κ] = 1. So that term is renormalizable.

But if [κ] is negative, say [κ]=-1, then [φ]^3 would require that [κ] + 3*1 = 4 → [κ]=1, which is positive. But in this problem, the term is L = κ (ψ terms) F terms. Each ψ is 3/2. So for the product ψ ψ F, which is 3/2 + 3/2 + 2 = 5. So the term is κ multiplied by 5. So the coupling's dimension must be 4 -5 = -1.

Wait, but dimension-wise, the Lagrangian is supposed to have dimension 4. So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So each term in L must have [term]_M =4. So the product of fields and couplings must add up to 4.

In this case, the term is κ * (ψ̄ σ ψ) F^{μν}. Let me compute the dimensions:

Each ψ is 3/2. So ψ̄ ψ is (3/2)*2=3.

F^{μν} has dimension 2. So 3 +2 =5.

So for the term κ * (5) to have dimension 4, κ must be 4-5= -1.

So [κ]_M = -1.

Now, for renormalizability: the interaction terms must have coupling constants with positive or zero mass dimension. Because when you have a term like g φ^n, the dimension is [g] + n [φ] =4. So [g] =4 -n [φ]. For φ being a scalar with [φ]_M=1, for example, if n=3, [g] =4-3=1, which is positive. So the theory is renormalizable. But if [g] is negative, say if n=5, then [g]=4-5=-1. Then the interaction term is nonrenormalizable because higher order terms would require higher powers of the coupling, leading to more divergences.

So when [κ] is negative, the term is nonrenormalizable.

So in our case, [κ]=-1. So the theory is not renormalizable. So the correct answer should have [κ]_M =-1 and theory not renormalizable. Looking at the options, option C says that: mass dimension -1, theory not renormalizable.

So the answer is option C.

To determine the mass dimension of $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$. The mass dimension of the Lagrangian density in 4 spacetime dimensions is 4, as the action is dimensionless and the integration measure $d^4x$ has mass dimension 4.

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of the fields
- The fermion field $\psi$ has mass dimension $[\psi]_M = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ for electromagnetism has mass dimension $[F]_M = 2$.

### Step 2: Mass dimension of the interaction term
The interaction term $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ involves:
- $\bar{\psi}$ and $\psi$, each with mass dimension $\frac{3}{2}$, so their product has mass dimension $\frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} = 3$.
- $F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension $2$.
- $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is a commutator of $\gamma$-matrices, which are dimensionless.

Thus, the total mass dimension of the term $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ is $3 + 2 = 5$. Since the Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4, the coupling constant $\kappa$ must satisfy:

\[
[\kappa]_M + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa]_M = 4 - 5 = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. In this case, $[\kappa]_M = -1$, which is negative. A negative mass dimension implies that the interaction term is nonrenormalizable because it introduces higher-order divergences that cannot be absorbed into a finite number of counterterms. Therefore, the theory is not renormalizable.

### Step 4: Final answer
From the above analysis, $\kappa$ has mass dimension $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to option **C**.
