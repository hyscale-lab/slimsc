Okay, so I'm looking at this genetics question, and I need to figure out which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the question says that the gene responsible for the compound has five exons and four introns. So the gene is split into exons and introns, and the exons are the coding regions. The problem is that this gene produces a compound that's bad for nutrition, so we want to mutate it so it doesn't produce that compound anymore.

The approach used here is EMS mutagenesis, which usually causes point mutations. So each mutant probably has a single change in the DNA sequence. The goal is to find the mutation that disrupts the gene's function, probably by causing a premature stop codon or a significant change in the protein structure.

Looking at the sequences provided, the intact gene and the four mutants have some changes in the first exon area. Let me compare each mutant's sequence to the intact one.

Intact gene: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Wait, so let's look at the changes. Comparing the first part:

Intact: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACT...
Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACT...

Hmm, let me line them up.

Looking at the first few codons, the change occurs in the first exon. Let me see the exact bases.

Looking at Mutant 1's first part:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG T...

Wait, wait, I think I should break it down into triplets, since it's mRNA, each codon is three bases.

So, the intact gene starts with ATG (which is methionine, the start codon), then TTT (Phe), then CTC (Leu), then GCT (Ala), etc.

Mutant 1: The sequence is ATG TTT becomes ATG TTC? Wait no:

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me look at the sequences more carefully.

The intact gene:

5' - ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG T ... -3'

Mutant 1:

5' - ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG C ... -3'

Wait, so the first part is:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT ...
Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT ...

So, the first codon after start is:

Intact: TTT (Phe)
Mutant1: TTC (also Phe). So that's the same amino acid. Then, the next codon in intact is CTC (Leu), but in Mutant1 it's TAC (Tyr). So that's a change from Leu to Tyr.

Wait, but that's a single substitution. So the amino acid at that position would change. Is that enough to disrupt the function? Maybe, but not necessarily a stop codon.

Moving on to Mutant 2:

Mutant2 sequence: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So let's compare.

Intact has ... TCT CGC TGG TAC ... ?

Mutant2 starts with ATG TTC TAAGC TGG TAC...

Wait, perhaps the change occurs in the middle. Let me see. The first part:

Intact: ... TCT CGC TGG TAC ...

Mutant2: ... TCT AAG C TGG TAC ...

Hmm, maybe I'm getting the letters wrong. Let me write the letters instead of the triplets.

Intact: ... T C G C T G G T A C ...

Mutant2: ... T A A G C T G G T A C ...

Wait, perhaps the part where the intact has CGC becomes AAG in mutant 2? Wait, maybe I'm miscounting.

Alternatively, perhaps the key point is the presence of a frameshift or an in-frame stop codon.

Wait, but in the options, all the mutants are point mutations because EMS usually causes point mutations, not insertions or deletions. So the length of the mRNA should be the same.

Looking at each mutant's change:

Mutant1: Change in the second codon and third codon. So, Phe remains Phe, but the next codon changes from Leu (CTC) to Tyr (TAC). So that's a point mutation, substitution.

Mutant2: Looking at the sequence, the change is in the middle. Let me compare the same region.

Intact: ... TCT CGC TGG TAC TCT ...

Mutant2: ... TCT AAG C TGG TAC TCT ...

Wait, perhaps I should look for a stop codon. The presence of a stop codon (TAA, TAG, TGA) early in the sequence would truncate the protein, making it nonfunctional.

Looking at each mutant:

Intact ends with ... TCG T ... which is CGT (Arg), then ... etc.

Mutant1: ends with ... TCG C ... which is CGC (Arg). So no stop codon introduced.

Mutant2: ends with ... TCG C ... Hmm, same as Mutant1.

Wait, perhaps looking elsewhere. Let me check for any TGA or TAG, etc.

Wait, the intact gene has ... TGA ... at the end. Let me see:

Intact: ... TCG T ... TGA ... so the last part is TGA, which is a stop codon. So the last triplet is TGA.

But in mutants, I need to see if the stop occurs earlier.

Let's look at Mutant4:

Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Hmm, let me see the sequence in the beginning.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT ...
Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT ...

Wait, so triplet breakdown:

Intact starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...
Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...

So, the first three codons are the same (ATG, TTT), then in Mutant4, the next codon is TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu). Then, GCT (Ala) in intact becomes ACT (Thr) in Mutant4. Wait, no, let me check:

Wait, the sequence of Mutant4 is:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Breaking it into triplets:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG T ...TGA

So, the third codon is TAC (Tyr), fourth is GCT (Ala), fifth is ACT (Thr). In the intact gene, the third codon is CTC (Leu), the fourth is GCT (Ala), the fifth is GGT (Gly). So, in Mutant4, the third codon is changed from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr), and the fifth codon is changed from GGT (Gly) to ACT (Thr). So two changes here.

But that's about amino acids, but the question is about the presence of the anti-nutritional compound. So perhaps it's a matter of whether the gene is non-functional. If the mutation leads to a premature stop codon, the protein would be truncated and possibly not functional.

Looking at each mutant's sequence:

Looking for where a stop codon appears. For that, let's check the sequence of each mutant and see if a stop codon occurs before the original stop.

Intact gene ends with ... TCG T ... TGA.

So the last codon is TGA, which is a stop.

Now, looking for any mutation that introduces a stop codon before that.

In Mutant1:

Looking at the sequence, let's see if any triplet is a stop codon.

ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG C...

So the triplets are:

ATG (start), TTC (Phe), TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), CAA (Gln), TAT (Tyr), TTA (Leu), TTG (Leu), TCG (Ser), CGC (Arg). Hmm, no stop codon. So the stop is still at the end. So the protein would be the same length, but with some amino acids changed. Maybe the compound is still produced, but perhaps not as much or it's altered. But if the compound's synthesis is dependent on the entire protein being functional, this might not eliminate it.

Mutant2:

Sequence: ATG TTC TAAGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG C ...

Wait, perhaps I should look at the triplets:

ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG C...

So, let's break it down:

ATG (start), TTC (Phe), TAA (stop codon). Oh, wait! TAA is a stop codon. So in Mutant2, the third codon is TAA, which would cause the protein to terminate right there. So the protein would be much shorter. This would likely disrupt the function of the gene, as the protein is truncated. Therefore, the anti-nutritional compound might not be produced, or at least the gene's function is disrupted.

But wait, I have to make sure that the mutation actually introduces a stop codon. Let me look again. The original for Mutant2 is after the first few codons:

Intact: ... TCT CGC TGG TAC TCT ...

Mutant2: ... TCT AAG C TGG TAC TCT...

Wait, perhaps the three bases after TTC are AAG, but I'm a bit confused. Let me count the letters.

Intact at that spot is: TCT CGC TGG TAC TCT...
Mutant2: TCT AAG C TGG TAC TCT...

Wait, perhaps I should write the exact sequences.

Intact: ...TCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTG...
Mutant2: ...TCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTG...

So, the 4th codon in the intact gene is CGC (Ala). In Mutant2, it's AAG (Lys), but wait, that's if the mutation is within the same reading frame. Wait, how many bases have been changed?

Wait, if the mutation is substitution, it's a point mutation. So the reading frame remains the same. Let's count.

Intact: ... T C G C T G G T A C ...

Mutant2: ... T A A G C T G G T A C ...

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting the letters. Let me look at the exact sequences.

The intact gene's segment is TCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAA..., and Mutant2's is TCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAA...

So, comparing:

Intact: positions 4-6: TCG, positions 7-9: C G C, etc.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the letters. Alternatively, perhaps the exact mutation is a substitution of CGC to AAG.

Wait, in the intact gene, the codon is CGC (Ala), and in Mutant2, it becomes AAG (Lys). But no stop there. But perhaps earlier in the sequence, maybe a TAA is introduced.

Wait, looking at Mutant2's sequence, perhaps the first few codons are:

ATG TTC TAA GCT ...

So, that would be:

ATG (start), TTC (Phe), TAA (stop), GCT (Ala), etc.

So the third codon is TAA, which is a stop codon. That would cause the protein to terminate after the Phe. So the protein would be way shorter, which likely disrupts the gene function.

So that's a big change. Therefore, Mutant2 would likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

Now, let's check the other mutants.

Mutant3:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Breaking it into triplets:

ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG T ...

So, the codons are:

ATG (start), TTT (Phe), TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), GTC (Val), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), CAA (Gln), TAT (Tyr), TTA (Leu), TTG (Leu), TCG (Ser), CGT (Arg), and then TGA (stop).

So in this case, the stop is at the end, same as intact. But the middle has some amino acid changes. For example, the Gly in position 4 is followed by Val instead of TCA? Wait, I'm not sure. So the protein would be longer, but perhaps with changes. But no early stop, so the protein is still full-length, but altered. Maybe the function is disrupted, but perhaps not entirely. For example, a single amino acid substitution might not completely eliminate the compound, just change its structure, but the gene is still functional enough to produce the compound.

Mutant4:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Triplets:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG T...

So, the codons are:

ATG, TTT, TAC, GCT, ACT, TCT, GTG, GAT, GAA, CAA, TAT, TTA, TTG, TCG, CGT, TGA.

So again, the stop is at the end. But looking at the codons, the sequence after TAC is GCT (Ala), then ACT (Thr) instead of GGT (Gly) perhaps. So this would change the amino acids. But no stop codon introduced early, so the protein would be longer, but perhaps nonfunctional if the changes are critical. But again, it's not introducing a stop early on, so the gene might still produce a functional (but altered) protein, or perhaps the changes disrupt the function enough to not produce the compound.

But wait, in Mutant4, after TAC (position 3), the next codon is GCT (Ala), same as the intact. Wait, but perhaps I'm getting the breakdown wrong. Let me write the exact letters.

Intact: ...TCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Mutant4: ...TCTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Wait, perhaps not. Hmm, maybe I should look for any changes that lead to a stop codon.

Another approach: which mutation introduces a stop codon early in the sequence?

Mutant2 has a TAA codon as the third codon, which is a stop.

Mutant4: Let me check the triplets again.

Mutant4: ... TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT ...

So codons:

TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), etc.

No stop codons in that stretch.

So, the only mutant that introduces a stop codon is Mutant2. Because after the start, it's TTC (Phe), then TAA (stop). So the protein would be very short, likely nonfunctional.

Wait, but wait: the start codon is ATG, then TTC, then TAA. So the mRNA would code for Met-Phe, then stop. So the protein would be just two amino acids long, Met-Phe. That's way shorter than the original protein. So the gene's function is completely disrupted, meaning the anti-nutritional compound won't be produced.

Therefore, the correct answer is Mutant2, which is option A.

To determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to identify the mutation that disrupts the gene's function. This can occur if the mutation introduces a premature stop codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA), significantly altering the protein product or rendering it nonfunctional.

### Analysis of Each Mutant:

1. **Intact Gene**:  
   The sequence is provided as a reference. The gene contains five exons and four introns, with the last codon being TGA, a stop codon.

2. **Mutant 1**:  
   The sequence shows changes in the second and third codons. The second codon remains Phe (TTC), and the third codon changes from Leu (CTC) to Tyr (TAC). This is a point mutation that alters the amino acid sequence but does not introduce a stop codon. The protein remains full-length, so the gene's function is likely still intact.

3. **Mutant 2**:  
   The sequence shows a critical change in the third codon. The first codon is ATG (start), the second codon is TTC (Phe), and the third codon is TAA, a stop codon. This introduces a premature stop codon, resulting in a truncated protein that is only two amino acids long (Met-Phe). This completely disrupts the gene's function, making it highly likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

4. **Mutant 3**:  
   The sequence shows changes in the fourth and fifth codons. The fourth codon changes from Gly (GGT) to Val (GTC), and the fifth codon changes from Thr (ACT) to Ser (TCA). These are point mutations that alter the amino acid sequence, but no stop codon is introduced. The protein remains full-length, so the gene's function is likely still intact.

5. **Mutant 4**:  
   The sequence shows changes in the fourth codon. The fourth codon changes from Ala (GCT) to Thr (ACT). This is a point mutation that alters the amino acid sequence, but no stop codon is introduced. The protein remains full-length, so the gene's function is likely still intact.

### Conclusion:
Among the mutants, only Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon (TAA) early in the sequence, resulting in a severely truncated protein. This disruption is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

Intact gene: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Wait, so let's look at the changes. Comparing the first part:

Intact: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACT...
Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACT...

Hmm, let me line them up.

Looking at the first few codons, the change occurs in the first exon. Let me see the exact bases.

Looking at Mutant 1's first part:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG T...

Wait, wait, I think I should break it down into triplets, since it's mRNA, each codon is three bases.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me look at the sequences more carefully.

The intact gene:

5' - ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG T ... -3'

Mutant 1:

5' - ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG C ... -3'

Wait, so the first part is:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT ...
Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT ...

So, the first codon after start is:

Intact: TTT (Phe)
Mutant1: TTC (also Phe). So that's the same amino acid. Then, the next codon in intact is CTC (Leu), but in Mutant1 it's TAC (Tyr). So that's a change from Leu to Tyr.

Wait, but that's a single substitution. So the amino acid at that position would change. Is that enough to disrupt the function? Maybe, but not necessarily a stop codon.

Moving on to Mutant 2:

Mutant2 sequence: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So let's compare.

Intact has ... TCT CGC TGG TAC ... ?

Mutant2 starts with ATG TTC TAAGC TGG TAC...

Wait, perhaps the change occurs in the middle. Let me see. The first part:

Intact: ... TCT CGC TGG TAC ...

Mutant2: ... TCT AAG C TGG TAC ...

Hmm, maybe I'm getting the letters wrong. Let me write the letters instead of the triplets.

Intact: ... T C G C T G G T A C ...

Mutant2: ... T A A G C T G G T A C ...

Wait, perhaps the part where the intact has CGC becomes AAG in mutant 2? Wait, maybe I'm miscounting.

Alternatively, perhaps the key point is the presence of a frameshift or an in-frame stop codon.

Wait, but in the options, all the mutants are point mutations because EMS usually causes point mutations, not insertions or deletions. So the length of the mRNA should be the same.

Wait, perhaps looking elsewhere. Let me check for any TGA or TAG, etc.

Wait, the intact gene has ... TGA ... at the end. Let me see:

Intact: ... TCG T ... TGA ... so the last part is TGA, which is a stop codon. So the last triplet is TGA.

But in mutants, I need to see if the stop occurs earlier.

Let's look at Mutant4:

Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Hmm, let me see the sequence in the beginning.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT ...
Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT ...

Wait, so triplet breakdown:

Intact starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...
Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...

So, the first three codons are the same (ATG, TTT), then in Mutant4, the next codon is TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu). Then, GCT (Ala) in intact becomes ACT (Thr) in Mutant4. Wait, no, let me check:

Wait, the sequence of Mutant4 is:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Breaking it into triplets:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG T ...TGA

So, the third codon is TAC (Tyr), fourth is GCT (Ala), fifth is ACT (Thr). In the intact gene, the third codon is CTC (Leu), the fourth is GCT (Ala), the fifth is GGT (Gly). So, in Mutant4, the third codon is changed from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr), and the fifth codon is changed from GGT (Gly) to ACT (Thr). So two changes here.

But that's about amino acids, but the question is about the presence of the anti-nutritional compound. So perhaps it's a matter of whether the gene is non-functional. If the mutation leads to a premature stop codon, the protein would be truncated and possibly not functional.

ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG C...

So the triplets are:

ATG (start), TTC (Phe), TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), CAA (Gln), TAT (Tyr), TTA (Leu), TTG (Leu), TCG (Ser), CGC (Arg). Hmm, no stop codon. So the stop is still at the end. So the protein would be the same length, but with some amino acids changed. Maybe the compound is still produced, but perhaps not as much or it's altered.

ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG C...

So, let's break it down:

Mutant2: TCT AAG C TGG TAC TCT...

Wait, perhaps I should write the exact sequences.

Intact: ...TCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTG...
Mutant2: ...TCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTG...

So, the 4th codon in the intact gene is CGC (Ala). In Mutant2, it's AAG (Lys), but wait, that's if the mutation is within the same reading frame. Wait, how many bases have been changed?

Wait, if the mutation is substitution, it's a point mutation. So the reading frame remains the same. Let's count.

Intact: ... T C G C T G G T A C ...

Mutant2: ... T A A G C T G G T A C ...

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting the letters. Let me look at the exact sequences.

The intact gene's segment is TCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAA..., and Mutant2's is TCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAA...

So, comparing:

Intact: positions 4-6: TCG, positions 7-9: C G C, etc.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the letters. Alternatively, perhaps the exact mutation is a substitution of CGC to AAG.

Wait, in the intact gene, the codon is CGC (Ala), and in Mutant2, it becomes AAG (Lys). But no stop there. But perhaps earlier in the sequence, maybe a TAA is introduced.

Wait, looking at Mutant2's sequence, perhaps the first few codons are:

ATG TTC TAA GCT ...

So, that would be:

ATG (start), TTC (Phe), TAA (stop), GCT (Ala), etc.

So the third codon is TAA, which is a stop codon. That would cause the protein to terminate after the Phe. So the protein would be way shorter, which likely disrupts the gene function.

So that's a big change. Therefore, Mutant2 would likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

Now, let's check the other mutants.

Mutant3:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Breaking it into triplets:

ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG T ...

So, the codons are:

ATG (start), TTT (Phe), TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), GTC (Val), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), CAA (Gln), TAT (Tyr), TTA (Leu), TTG (Leu), TCG (Ser), CGT (Arg), and then TGA (stop).

So in this case, the stop is at the end, same as intact. But the middle has some amino acid changes. For example, the Gly in position 4 is followed by Val instead of TCA? Wait, I'm not sure.

Mutant4:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Triplets:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG T...

So, the codons are:

ATG, TTT, TAC, GCT, ACT, TCT, GTG, GAT, GAA, CAA, TAT, TTA, TTG, TCG, CGT, TGA.

So again, the stop is at the end. But looking at the codons, the sequence after TAC is GCT (Ala), then ACT (Thr) instead of GGT (Gly) perhaps. So this would change the amino acids. But no stop codon introduced early, so the protein would be longer, but perhaps nonfunctional if the changes are critical. But again, it's not introducing a stop early on, so the gene might still produce a functional (but altered) protein, or perhaps the changes disrupt the function enough to not produce the compound.

But wait, in Mutant4, after TAC (position 3), the next codon is GCT (Ala), same as the intact. Wait, but perhaps I'm getting the breakdown wrong. Let me write the exact letters.

Intact: ...TCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Mutant4: ...TCTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Wait, perhaps not. Hmm, maybe I should look for any changes that lead to a stop codon.

Another approach: which mutation introduces a stop codon early in the sequence?

Mutant2 has a TAA codon as the third codon, which is a stop.

Mutant4: Let me check the triplets again.

Mutant4: ... TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT ...

So codons:

TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), etc.

No stop codons in that stretch.

So, the only mutant that introduces a stop codon is Mutant2. Because after the start, it's TTC (Phe), then TAA (stop). So the protein would be very short, likely nonfunctional.

Wait, but wait: the start codon is ATG, then TTC, then TAA. So the mRNA would code for Met-Phe, then stop. So the protein would be just two amino acids long, Met-Phe.

### Analysis of Each Mutant:

1. **Intact Gene**:  
   The sequence is provided as a reference. The gene contains five exons and four introns, with the last codon being TGA, a stop codon.

2. **Mutant 1**:  
   The sequence shows changes in the second and third codons. The second codon remains Phe (TTC), and the third codon changes from Leu (CTC) to Tyr (TAC). This is a point mutation that alters the amino acid sequence but does not introduce a stop codon. The protein remains full-length, so the gene's function is likely still intact.

3. **Mutant 2**:  
   The sequence shows a critical change in the third codon. The first codon is ATG (start), the second codon is TTC (Phe), and the third codon is TAA, a stop codon. This introduces a premature stop codon, resulting in a truncated protein that is only two amino acids long (Met-Phe). This completely disrupts the gene's function, making it highly likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

4. **Mutant 3**:  
   The sequence shows changes in the fourth and fifth codons. The fourth codon changes from Gly (GGT) to Val (GTC), and the fifth codon changes from Thr (ACT) to Ser (TCA). These are point mutations that alter the amino acid sequence, but no stop codon is introduced. The protein remains full-length, so the gene's function is likely still intact.

5. **Mutant 4**:  
   The sequence shows changes in the fourth codon. The fourth codon changes from Ala (GCT) to Thr (ACT). This is a point mutation that alters the amino acid sequence, but no stop codon is introduced. The protein remains full-length, so the gene's function is likely still intact.

### Conclusion:
Among the mutants, only Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon (TAA) early in the sequence, resulting in a severely truncated protein. This disruption is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.
