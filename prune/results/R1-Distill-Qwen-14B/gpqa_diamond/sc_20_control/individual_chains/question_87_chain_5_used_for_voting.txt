Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down. The question is about identifying the correct 1H NMR spectrum for a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The compound has 8 carbon atoms in total. Oh wait, a di-substituted benzene ring, I think. And the FTIR shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. Hmm, okay.

So, the molecule has a benzene ring, which is 6-membered. Di-substituted means two substituents attached to the ring. The total carbon count is 8, so the substituents add up to 2 carbons because benzene has 6. Wait, but benzene is C6H6, so substituents would add to that. Let me think: the compound has 8 carbons in total. Benzene is 6, so the substituents must be 2 carbons. But wait, substituents can be groups like methyl, but let's see.

Wait, the substituents could be a carbonyl group and a halogen. Because in the IR, there are peaks for a carbonyl (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (like Cl, Br, etc.). So the substituents are a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen.

Wait, but aromatic halogens like Cl or Br are usually activating groups. The carbonyl would be a deactivating group. So the substituents are a carbonyl group (like a ketone, maybe) and a halogen.

Wait, but let's think about the possible structures. If the ring has two substituents, and one is a carbonyl group, which would be a ketone perhaps. Like a benzophenone derivative, but with a halogen as the other substituent.

Wait, another thought: the substituents could be an acyl group, like an acetyl (CH3CO-), but that's more than one carbon. Wait, but the substituents have to sum to two carbons since the total is 8. Benzene (6) + substituents (2) = 8. So each substituent would be one carbon? Or perhaps one substituent is two carbons, and the other is zero? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, the substituents could be a carbonyl group and a halide. Let's think: a carbonyl group would be like a ketone, O=C-R. But wait, the substituent attached to the ring must be a single group. Oh, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group attached to the ring, like a benzoyl group. Wait, but that's if it's a ketone attached as a substituent.

Wait, maybe the substituents are a carbonyl group (like a ketone substituent) and a halogen. For example, something like 4-halobenzophenone? But wait, then the carbonyl is part of the ring substituent. Let me think about the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are a ketone (like an acetyl group) and a halogen. But wait, the acetyl group would be -COCH3, which is 2 carbons. Then the other substituent would be a halogen, which is one substituent, but that would add more than two carbons.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are a carbonyl group (like a carbonyl attached directly to the ring, like in acetophenone) and another substituent which is a halogen. Let me think: acetophenone is a benzene ring with a ketone substituent (propan-2-one attached to benzene). So the structure is C6H5-CO-CH3. That's 8 carbons in total: benzene (6) + CO (1, from the ketone) + CH3 (1), wait no: the ketone is O=C-CH3, so the substituent is -COCH3 which is 2 carbons. So that's 6 (benzene) + 2 (COCH3) = 8? No, wait, 6 + 2 is 8, yes. So that would fit.

Wait, but in that case, the other substituent is the halogen. So the molecule would have two substituents on the benzene ring: one is -COCH3 and the other is a halogen. So it's a di-substituted benzene with a ketone group and a halogen.

Wait, but the question says the aromatic ring has 8 carbons in total. So the substituents must sum to 2 carbons. So substituents could be a carbonyl group (like as part of a ketone) and maybe a halogen. But the carbonyl group in a ketone is -CO-R. So if R is a methyl group, that would be 2 carbons. So the substituent is -COCH3, which has 2 carbons. Then the other substituent is a halogen, which is just one atom, so no carbons. So the total carbons would be 6 (benzene) + 2 (COCH3) + 0 (halogen) = 8. So that fits.

So the structure is a benzene ring with a ketone substituent (-COCH3) and a halogen, say -Cl or -Br. So the molecule is something like para-chloroacetophenone or meta, or whatever.

Now, the NMR would show signals for the aromatic protons, the carbonyl group's neighboring protons, and any other groups like the methyl from the ketone.

Let me think about the possible structures and their NMR spectra.

Option A: 9.9 ppm (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)

Wait, 9.9 is a singlet, which could be an aldehyde proton, but wait, if the substituent was an aldehyde, but aldehydes are usually less stable in aromatic substitution. Alternatively, maybe a ketone's alpha proton. But a singlet suggests no neighboring H. Wait, 9.9 is usually a strong deshielded proton. Could it be an aldehyde? But in the structure I was thinking, the substituent is -COCH3, which doesn't have an aldehyde proton. So maybe this is not the case.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an acetyl group (COCH3), which doesn't have protons attached to the carbonyl. So any protons near the carbonyl would be the CH3 group, which is usually around 2.1-2.6 ppm as a singlet. But in option A, the 3.7 ppm is a singlet of 2H. Wait, that's two protons as a singlet. Hmm, maybe that's the splitting due to something else. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a carbonyl attached to an oxygen, like an ester or something else.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a methoxy group, but that's an OMe group. But the carbonyl would be another substituent. Hmm, not sure.

Option B: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s). These are upfield shifts. The doublets at 4.8 and 4.6 could be from an ethylene group adjacent to an oxygen, like in an ether or ester. The 1.3 is a singlet for a CH3 group. Maybe this is a structure with a methylene group next to an oxygen, like OCH2CH2O or similar. But wait, the molecule has a carbonyl group, so perhaps something else. Not sure if this fits the problem.

Option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). The aromatic region has two doublets, which suggests a para-substituted ring with two substituents. The 2.3 ppm singlet is likely a methyl group attached to something deshielded, like a carbonyl. So, COCH3. That matches with what I was thinking earlier. So the substituents are a carbonyl group (like a ketone) and a halogen. So the aromatic protons would be in a para arrangement. Wait, but the substituents are the halogen and the ketone. So, if the substituents are para, the aromatic protons would be two doublets each integrating for two protons. So that's what option C shows.

Option D: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s). The aromatic singlet at 6.9 suggests a substituent that causes all the aromatic protons to be equivalent except for one, but that might be a mono-substituted ring. Hmm, not sure. The other signals are similar to option B, perhaps from an oxygenated group.

Wait, the problem states it's a di-substituted aromatic ring, so the substituents are in the ring at two positions. So the aromatic protons would be split into two sets, maybe as two doublets if they're para, or other patterns if they're meta.

Let me think again about the structure. If the ring is di-substituted with a carbonyl group (like ketone) and a halogen, let's say in the para positions.

So, let's imagine para-substituted benzene with -COCH3 and -X (X is Cl, Br, etc.). So the aromatic protons would be in two sets. Let's see: the substituents are in opposite positions, so the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons. Each set would have two protons, each as a doublet, because each is next to one proton in the other set.

So, for example, in para-substituted benzene, the protons ortho to each substituent would be equivalent. So the NMR would show two doublets, each integrating for two protons. That's what option C shows: 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). So that makes sense.

The 2.3 ppm singlet is likely the methyl group attached to the carbonyl (COCH3). That fits.

So option C's NMR shows aromatic protons as two doublets, each 2H, and a singlet at 2.3 for 3H. That would correspond to the -COCH3 group.

Wait, but what about the halogen? The halogen is on the ring, but it's an electronegative atom and doesn't contribute to the 1H NMR. So in the NMR, we don't see protons from the halogen, but it affects the ring's protons.

So in the NMR, the aromatic protons will be influenced by the substituents. The substituents' positions (para or meta) will determine the splitting.

In the para case, the substituents are opposite each other, so the ring has two sets of equivalent protons. Each set is two protons, each as a doublet because they're coupling with each other.

So in the NMR, two doublets, each 2H, as in option C.

So the NMR for option C would look like that.

Let's check the other options.

Option A: 9.9 ppm is very high, which is more like an aldehyde proton. But in our structure, the substituent is a ketone, so no aldehyde proton. So option A is unlikely.

Option B: The peaks are all upfield, which suggests maybe an ether or something with oxygen nearby, but I'm not sure how that relates to the carbonyl and halogen. Plus, the aromatic region is missing or maybe not shown, but option B doesn't show any aromatic protons. So I think B is not correct.

Option D: The aromatic is a singlet, which suggests a single proton, implying a different substitution pattern, perhaps meta. But the question states it's di-substituted, and if substituents are para, the aromatic protons would be in two doublets. So D's NMR doesn't fit.

So the correct answer should be option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with 8 carbon atoms in total, indicating that the two substituents on the benzene ring sum to 2 carbons. The FTIR spectrum shows peaks for a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond, suggesting the substituents are a carbonyl-containing group (e.g., -COCH₃, a ketone) and a halogen (e.g., -Cl or -Br). 

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A**: The peak at 9.9 ppm (1H, s) is characteristic of an aldehyde proton, which is inconsistent with the structure since the substituents are a ketone (-COCH₃) and a halogen, not an aldehyde. Additionally, the 3.7 ppm (2H, s) does not align with the expected methyl group of the ketone. This option is incorrect.

2. **Option B**: The peaks at 4.8 ppm (2H, d) and 4.6 ppm (2H, d) suggest an oxygenated group (e.g., -OCH₂CH₂-), which is inconsistent with the given substituents. Furthermore, there are no aromatic protons visible in this spectrum, which contradicts the presence of a benzene ring. This option is incorrect.

3. **Option C**: The aromatic region shows two doublets at 7.8 ppm (2H, d) and 7.6 ppm (2H, d), consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring. The singlet at 2.3 ppm (3H, s) corresponds to the methyl group of the ketone (-COCH₃). This matches the expected NMR for a di-substituted benzene with a ketone and a halogen. This option is correct.

4. **Option D**: The singlet at 6.9 ppm (1H, s) suggests a single aromatic proton, which is inconsistent with a di-substituted benzene ring. Additionally, the peaks at 4.8 ppm (2H, d) and 4.6 ppm (2H, d) again suggest an oxygenated group, which is not part of the given substituents. This option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct NMR spectrum corresponds to a para-substituted benzene ring with a ketone (-COCH₃) and a halogen as substituents, showing two doublets for the aromatic protons and a singlet for the methyl group of the ketone.
