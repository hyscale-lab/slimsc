Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The spins are S1, S2, and S3, each can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z. Oh right, partition function is the sum over all possible states of exp(-β E), where β is 1/(kT).

Wait, each spin has two possible states, so for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. But considering that the energy depends on the product of spins, maybe there's a smarter way than enumerating all 8 states.

Let me think about the energy expression. Since each term is S_i S_j, which is +1 if the spins are the same and -1 if opposite. So each term S_iS_j can be either +1 or -1. But when you sum them, the total inside the brackets could vary.

So E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let's denote the sum as S = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. So E = -J * S.

So for each state, I calculate S, multiply by -J, and then take the exponential.

But maybe it's easier to find the possible values of S and how many states correspond to each. Because then I can compute each term as (number of states) * e^(-β E) for that S.

So what are the possible values of S?

Each term is ±1, but S is the sum of three terms. So possible S values could be 3, 1, -1, -3.

Wait, let's see. Let's consider all possible cases.

Case 1: All three products are +1. So S = 3. When does this happen? All spins are aligned. Like all +1 or all -1. Because S_i S_j would be +1 only if S_i and S_j are same.

Wait, if all three spins are the same, then S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. So sum S=3. How many such states? The system can be all +1 or all -1. So 2 states.

Case 2: Two of the products are +1, one is -1. Then S = 2 -1 =1.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. Each product is either +1 or -1. So if two are +1 and one is -1, the sum is +1.

But how can that happen? Let's think about the spins. Suppose two spins are the same and one is different. Let's say S1=S2=+1, S3=-1. Then S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. So S=1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1. Hmm, that's sum -1.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think differently. Maybe the sum S can be 3, 1, -1, -3.

Wait, another approach: Let me consider the possible values of S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Each S_i S_j is 1 if S_i = S_j, else -1.

Let me list all possible combinations. Since each spin is either +1 or -1.

There are 8 possible states:

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1:
   S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1 → S=3.

2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1:
   S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1 → S=1-1-1= -1.

3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1:
   S1S2=-1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1 → S= -1 +1 -1 = -1.

4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1:
   S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1 → S=-1 -1 +1 = -1.

Wait, that's strange. So for states 2,3,4: S=-1.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me recheck state 2:

Wait, S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1. So S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3= -1. So sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. Correct.

State 3: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1. S1S2=-1, S1S3=+1, S2S3 = (-1)(+1) =-1. So sum is -1+1 -1= -1.

State4: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1. S1S2=-1, S1S3 = (-1)(+1) =-1, S2S3=( -1)(-1)=1. Sum is -1 -1 +1 =-1.

Hmm. So states 2,3,4 have S=-1.

Wait, let's go on.

5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1:
   S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=+1. Sum: -1 -1 +1 =-1.

6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1:
   S1S2=-1, S1S3=+1, S2S3= (-1)*(-1)=1. Sum: -1 +1 +1 =1.

7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1:
   S1S2=1, S1S3= -1, S2S3= (-1)(+1)= -1. Sum: 1 -1 -1 =-1.

8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1:
   All products are 1. Sum S=3.

Wait, so looking at the states:

Only states 1 and 8 have S=3. So 2 states.

States 5,6, etc. Let me recount.

Wait, in states 2,3,4,5,7: S=-1. That's 5 states? But 8 states total, minus 2 gives 6? No, wait, looking: states 2,3,4,5,7 have S=-1. That's 5 states? Wait, no, let's count again.

Wait, in the list above:

States 2: S=-1.

State3: S=-1.

State4: S=-1.

State5: S=-1.

State6: S=1.

State7: S=-1.

So that's 5 states with S=-1, and 1 state with S=1, and 2 states with S=3.

Wait, state6 has S=1. Let's see: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1.

So S1S2=(-1)(+1)=-1.

S1S3= (-1)(-1)=+1.

S2S3= (+1)(-1)= -1.

So sum is -1 +1 -1 = -1. Wait, no! Did I make a mistake earlier?

Wait, maybe I messed up state6. Let me recheck.

No, wait, in state6, S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1.

So S1S2= (-1)(+1)=-1.

S1S3= (-1)(-1)=+1.

S2S3= (+1)(-1)=-1.

So sum is -1 +1 -1 = -1. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake when I wrote state6 as having S=1. No, it actually has S=-1.

Wait, so which state has S=1? Let me see.

Looking back, perhaps the only state with S=1 is when two products are +1 and one is -1. Let's see if any of the 8 states fit that.

Wait, for S=1, the sum must be 1. So that would require two +1 terms and one -1 term.

Looking at the 8 possible states:

Wait, perhaps state6 as I thought earlier. Let me think again.

No, state6 gives sum of -1. So maybe none of the states have S=1? That can't be right because the energy expression is symmetric.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I can compute S for each state again.

State1: all +1 → S=3.

State2: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1 → S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1 → 1-1-1 = -1.

State3: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1 → S1S2=-1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1 → sum: -1 +1 -1 =-1.

State4: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1 → S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1 → sum: -1 -1 +1 =-1.

State5: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1 → S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1 → sum: -1 -1 +1 =-1.

State6: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1 → S1S2=-1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1 → sum: -1 +1 -1 =-1.

State7: S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1 → S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1 → sum: 1 -1 -1 =-1.

State8: all -1 → sum S=3.

Wait, so in all the states except 1 and 8, the sum S is -1. So that's 6 states with S=-1. But wait, according to this, S can only be 3 or -1. But that can't be right because the energy function would not have any term with S=1.

Wait, but looking at the possible sum S, it's the sum of three terms each ±1, so possible sums are 3, 1, -1, -3.

But according to the above, all states except 1 and 8 have S=-1. So where are the states with S=1 or -3?

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in evaluating some states. Let's check another way.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that when two spins are the same, and the third is different, what is S?

Wait, for three spins, the number of same pairs depends on how many are same and how many are different.

Wait, perhaps if two spins are same and the third is different, then how many same pairs are there? Let's say S1 and S2 are same, S3 is different.

Then S1S2=1.

S1S3=-1.

S2S3=-1.

So S = 1 -1 -1 =-1.

If the configuration is two same and one different, you get S=-1.

What if all three are different? But wait, each spin is either +1 or -1. So you can't have all three different. Because with three spins, you have to have at least two same.

Wait, that's right. For three spins, possible cases are:

1. All three same → S=3.

2. Exactly two same, one different → S=-1.

But wait, what about the case where only two are same, but in a way that increases S?

Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing cases where S=1.

Wait, perhaps another approach: think of S as the sum of three terms, each ±1.

So the possible sums S are 3, 1, -1, -3.

But in the enumeration, I only found S=3 and S=-1.

Wait, that can't be right. Let's think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating the states. Let me pick state6 again:

S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1.

So S1S2 = (-1)(1) = -1.

S1S3= (-1)(-1)=1.

S2S3= (1)(-1) = -1.

So sum is -1 +1 -1 = -1.

Hmm, that's correct.

Wait, maybe I should consider another approach. Maybe using symmetry or some mathematical approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum S can be 3, 1, -1, -3, but the number of states for each sum is as follows:

- S=3: 2 states (all same).

- S=1: How many? Let's think: S=1 would require two +1 terms and one -1 term.

Wait, because 2*(+1) + (-1) =1.

So how many states give two +1 and one -1 in the sum.

Each term in the sum is S_i S_j.

So for S to be 1, you need two of the terms to be +1 and one to be -1.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the possible configurations that give S=1.

Wait, perhaps when one pair is same and the other two pairs are opposite.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the number of states for each possible S.

Wait, perhaps I can find the number of states for each possible value of S.

We know that for three spins, the possible S can be 3, 1, -1, -3.

Wait, but according to our earlier enumeration, I only found S=3 and S=-1. That can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the number of pairs that are aligned.

Each S_i S_j term being +1 means the spins are aligned (same), and -1 means opposite.

So for S=3: All three pairs aligned → all spins same. So 2 states.

For S=1: Two pairs aligned, one opposite.

So how many ways can that happen?

Let me think, for each of the three pairs (S1S2, S1S3, S2S3), two must be +1 and one must be -1.

But how many such states?

Wait, perhaps each such configuration corresponds to a state where two pairs are +1 and one is -1.

But how many such spin configurations lead to that?

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to count the number of states for each S.

Alternative approach: Let me compute the possible S and their multiplicities.

We can model this as the sum of three spin pairs. Each pair can be either aligned or not.

Wait, but perhaps another way: The sum S = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Let me compute S in terms of the spins.

Let me denote the spins as variables s1, s2, s3, each ±1.

So S = s1 s2 + s1 s3 + s2 s3.

Hmm, maybe I can express this differently. Let's factor.

Wait, S = s1 s2 + s1 s3 + s2 s3.

Factor s1 from first two terms: s1(s2 + s3) + s2 s3.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to write S in terms of the individual spins.

Let me see: Let me denote s1, s2, s3 as ±1.

Another approach: Let's compute S for all 8 possible states and count the occurrences.

Wait, that's what I tried before, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me list all 8 states and compute S for each:

1. s1=1, s2=1, s3=1:

   S = 1*1 + 1*1 +1*1 =3.

2. s1=1, s2=1, s3=-1:

   S=1*1 +1*(-1) +1*(-1) =1-1-1 =-1.

3. s1=1, s2=-1, s3=1:

   S=1*(-1) +1*1 + (-1)*1 =-1 +1 -1 =-1.

4. s1=1, s2=-1, s3=-1:

   S=1*(-1) +1*(-1) + (-1)*(-1) =-1-1+1= -1.

5. s1=-1, s2=1, s3=1:

   S=(-1)*1 + (-1)*1 +1*1 =-1-1+1 =-1.

6. s1=-1, s2=1, s3=-1:

   S=(-1)*1 + (-1)*(-1) +1*(-1) =-1 +1 -1 =-1.

7. s1=-1, s2=-1, s3=1:

   S=(-1)*(-1) + (-1)*1 + (-1)*1 =1-1-1=-1.

8. s1=-1, s2=-1, s3=-1:

   S= (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) =1+1+1=3.

Wait, so according to this, the only states with S=3 are states 1 and 8, and all other states have S=-1.

So S can be 3 or -1.

Wait, that's only two possible values of S. But that can't be right because the sum of three terms each ±1 can't take only two values. Wait, no, it can. Because 3 terms of +1 and -1 can sum to 3, 1, -1, -3.

But according to this, only 3 and -1 are present.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's take another approach.

Wait, perhaps I can compute S another way. Let me express S in terms of the individual spins.

Wait, S = s1 s2 + s1 s3 + s2 s3.

Let me factor this as s1(s2 + s3) + s2 s3.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write S as (s1 + s3)(s2 + s3) - s3^2.

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps express S in terms of the sum of spins.

Wait, another idea: Let me add and subtract terms to find a pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the possible values of S.

But according to the earlier enumeration, S can be 3 or -1. But that's only two values. That doesn't make sense because, for three terms each ±1, the possible sums are 3,1,-1,-3.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Alternatively, perhaps the energy is not symmetric and so some S values are impossible.

Wait, let me think again: if all three spins are the same, S is 3. If exactly two are same and one different, S would be:

Wait, let's say S1 and S2 are +1, S3 is -1.

Then S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. So sum is 1-1-1 =-1.

Similarly, if two are -1 and one is +1, the sum would be:

S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1 → sum is 1-1-1=-1.

Wait, so whether you have two same and one different, regardless of which two, the sum S is -1.

What about when all three are different? But that's impossible because you can't have three different values in binary. So the only possible cases are all same (S=3) and two same one different (S=-1).

But that would mean the sum can't be 1 or -3. That seems odd, but according to the state enumeration, that's the case.

Wait, but that would imply that the possible values of S are 3 and -1. So in that case, the partition function would sum over these two cases.

So let's proceed with that.

So, for the partition function Z, we have:

Z = sum_{states} exp(-β E).

E = -J S.

So exp(-β E) = exp(β J S).

For each state, we have S =3 or S=-1.

So for S=3: there are 2 states, each contributing exp(β J *3).

For S=-1: 6 states (since 8-2=6), each contributing exp(-β J *1) because S=-1.

So Z = 2 * exp(3 β J) + 6 * exp(-β J).

Wait, wait no, because E is -J S. So exp(-β E) is exp(β J S).

Ah, yes.

So for S=3, exponent is 3β J.

For S=-1, exponent is (-1) * β J, which is -β J.

So Z = 2 e^{3 β J} + 6 e^{- β J}.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option A is Z= 2 e^{-3Jβ} +6 e^{Jβ}.

Option B: 2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ}.

Yes, that's what I have. So option B.

Wait but wait, let me check the options again.

Options:

A) Z=2 e^(-3Jβ) +6 e^{Jβ}.

B) Z=2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ}.

C) Z= 2e^{2Jβ} +6e^{-2Jβ}.

D) Z=6e^{2Jβ} +2e^{-2Jβ}.

So according to my calculation, the correct answer is option B.

But wait, I thought earlier that the sum S could be 3 and -1. But that would make the exponentials as done.

Yes, so the correct partition function is Z=2 e^{3βJ} +6 e^{-βJ}.

Looking at option B: yes, that's exactly what it is.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To find the partition function \( Z \) for the system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), each of which can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), we start with the energy expression \( E = -J[S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3] \). The partition function is given by:

\[
Z = \sum_{\text{states}} e^{-\beta E},
\]
where \( \beta = 1/(kT) \). Substituting \( E = -J[S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3] \), we have:

\[
Z = \sum_{\text{states}} e^{\beta J [S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3]}.
\]

### Step 1: Possible values of \( S = S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \)
Each term \( S_iS_j \) can be \( +1 \) (if \( S_i = S_j \)) or \( -1 \) (if \( S_i \neq S_j \)). Since there are three terms, the possible values of \( S \) are \( 3, 1, -1, -3 \). However, by enumerating all 8 possible spin configurations, we find:

- **Case 1: All spins are the same** (\( S_1 = S_2 = S_3 \))  
  \( S_1S_2 = S_1S_3 = S_2S_3 = +1 \), so \( S = 3 \). There are 2 such states: all \( +1 \) or all \( -1 \).

- **Case 2: Exactly two spins are the same, and one is different**  
  For example, \( S_1 = S_2 = +1 \), \( S_3 = -1 \). Here, \( S_1S_2 = +1 \), \( S_1S_3 = -1 \), \( S_2S_3 = -1 \), so \( S = -1 \). There are 6 such states.

Thus, \( S \) can only take two values: \( S = 3 \) (for 2 states) and \( S = -1 \) (for 6 states).

### Step 2: Partition function calculation
For each state, the contribution to \( Z \) is \( e^{\beta J S} \). Substituting the possible values of \( S \):

- For \( S = 3 \): Contribution = \( 2 \cdot e^{\beta J \cdot 3} \).
- For \( S = -1 \): Contribution = \( 6 \cdot e^{\beta J \cdot (-1)} \).

Thus, the partition function is:

\[
Z = 2e^{3\beta J} + 6e^{-\beta J}.
\]

### Step 3: Matching with the options
Comparing this result with the given options:

- **Option A**: \( Z = 2e^{-3J\beta} + 6e^{J\beta} \) (Incorrect, signs of exponents are reversed).
- **Option B**: \( Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta} \) (Correct, matches the derived result).
- **Option C**: \( Z = 2e^{2J\beta} + 6e^{-2J\beta} \) (Incorrect, exponents are incorrect).
- **Option D**: \( Z = 6e^{2J\beta} + 2e^{-2J\beta} \) (Incorrect, exponents and coefficients are wrong).

### Final Answer:
The correct partition function is \( Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta} \), which corresponds to **Option B**.

Answer: B
