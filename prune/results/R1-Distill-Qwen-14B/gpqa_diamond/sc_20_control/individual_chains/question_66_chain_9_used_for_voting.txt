Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, or SMEFT. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options given are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. The choices are combinations of these.

First, I need to remember what each of these symmetries means. Lorentz symmetry has to do with how the laws of physics look the same in all inertial frames, right? So it's about transformations like rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations in space and time, so it's a bigger symmetry group that includes Lorentz plus the stuff about moving around in space and time.

In the Standard Model, Lorentz symmetry is a fundamental part. SMEFT is an effective theory built from the Standard Model, so I think it must respect Lorentz symmetry. All the operators in SMEFT are constructed to be Lorentz-invariant. That makes sense because the effective theory can't have terms that break Lorentz symmetry, as that would imply the Standard Model itself breaks it, which it doesn't.

Now, what about Poincare symmetry? Poincare includes translations, so it's like momentum and energy conservation. Wait, but in SMEFT, when you write down the operators, they are local, so they should respect all the symmetries of the Standard Model. But wait, Poincare is a broader symmetry than Lorentz. However, the operators in SMEFT are organized into terms with different Lorentz structures, but do they all respect Poincare?

Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up. I think that in the SMEFT, the operators are written in a way that they are Poincare-invariant. Because the effective theory is constructed to respect all the symmetries of the original Standard Model, including Poincare. So operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries. So options 1 and 2 would both be correct.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators consistent with the Standard Model symmetries. So if the Standard Model has Poincare symmetry, SMEFT must too. Otherwise, you'd be adding terms that the SM doesn't have. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries. So options 1 and 2 are correct.

What about CP and CPT? CP symmetry is Charge conjugation combined with Parity. CPT is Charge, Parity, and Time reversal. The Standard Model respects CPT symmetry but not CP in general. So, the question is, do operators in SMEFT have to respect CP and CPT?

Wait, in the SMEFT, when you include operators, you have to maintain the symmetries of the underlying theory, but you can include terms that break some of them. However, the question is about which symmetries "must be respected by all operators".

Wait, no. The SMEFT can include operators that break some of these symmetries. But the question is which symmetries are "must be respected" by all operators. So, which symmetries are enforced, regardless of the operator.

If the original Standard Model breaks CP symmetry (like in the CKM matrix), does that mean SMEFT can include operators that break CP? But wait, the question is about which symmetries are necessarily respected, meaning that the operators cannot violate them, regardless of the model.

Hmm, no. Wait, the SMEFT is a framework where you can have terms that violate certain symmetries, but only those that are already violated by the SM. So, for example, if the SM doesn't respect CP (like in the Higgs potential if it's not CP-symmetric), then SMEFT can include terms that also break CP. But wait, the SM itself does have CP violation in certain areas, like the CKM matrix. So, the SMEFT can include operators that break CP. So, operators in SMEFT don't have to respect CP symmetry. But they must respect symmetries that the SM already respects.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think again.

The SM respects CPT symmetry. So, all operators in the SMEFT must also respect CPT symmetry because the underlying theory does. But the SM doesn't necessarily respect CP symmetry. So, SMEFT operators can include terms that violate CP, as long as the SM already does.

Wait, but the question is about symmetries that must be respected by all operators. So if the SM already violates a symmetry, the SMEFT can include operators that also violate it. So, for example, if the SM violates CP, then SMEFT can have operators that break CP. But if the SM respects a symmetry, then SMEFT operators must respect it.

Wait, no, I'm getting this wrong. Because the SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators that are compatible with the SM's symmetries. So, any operator in SMEFT must not break any symmetry that the SM already respects, except for those that are explicitly broken by the SM.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me try to think of each symmetry:

1. Lorentz symmetry: The SM respects it. So SMEFT must include only operators that preserve Lorentz symmetry.

2. Poincare symmetry: Similarly, the SM respects Poincare, so SMEFT operators must respect that.

3. CP symmetry: The SM does not respect CP in all cases. So, SMEFT can include operators that break CP. So not all operators have to respect CP.

4. CPT symmetry: The SM respects CPT. Hence, SMEFT operators must respect CPT symmetry because they can't violate a symmetry that the SM has.

So, now, which symmetries must all SMEFT operators respect? Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). CP (3) is not necessarily respected because the SM allows for CP violation.

Wait, wait. Wait, the SM's CPT symmetry is a given, so SMEFT must respect CPT. So, the correct must-respected are 1, 2, and 4.

Looking back at the options, option C is 1,2,4. Option D is 1,3,4.

Wait, but the question is which symmetries "must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT". So, which of these symmetries are always respected by every operator in SMEFT.

So, 1 (Lorentz) and 2 (Poincare) must be respected, because they are part of the SM's fundamental symmetries. All SMEFT operators must be Poincare-invariant.

Wait, but wait, Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz plus translations. So if an operator is Lorentz-invariant, is it necessarily Poincare-invariant?

Hmm. Because Poincare includes both Lorentz transformations and translations. So an operator that is Lorentz-invariant but not invariant under translations would not be Poincare-invariant. But in the SMEFT, operators are local, so they don't have explicit momentum dependence. Wait, because operators are written as local terms, they should respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetry. Because any operator that's not Poincare-invariant would have terms that depend on momentum, which isn't allowed in a local theory.

Wait, no. The SMEFT operators are constructed as local operators, so they automatically respect Poincare symmetry because they are built from fields that transform covariantly under Poincare. So I think that in SMEFT, all operators must respect Poincare symmetry. That means both 1 and 2 are correct.

Now, what about CPT? Since the SM respects CPT, SMEFT operators must also respect CPT. Because you can't have operators that break a symmetry that the SM has. So, all operators must respect CPT (4).

So, the correct symmetries that must be respected are 1,2,4. So looking at the options: option C is 1,2,4. Option C is "1,2,4".

Wait, but the options are:

A) 1,2

B) 3,4

C) 1,2,4

D) 1,3,4

So the correct answer would be option C.

The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). To determine this, we analyze the symmetries in the context of the SMEFT framework, which is built to respect the symmetries of the Standard Model (SM) while allowing for higher-dimensional operators.

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: The Standard Model respects Lorentz symmetry, and SMEFT operators are constructed to be Lorentz-invariant. This is a fundamental requirement for any operator in SMEFT. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry (1) must be respected.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations in space and time. Since SMEFT operators are local and constructed from fields that transform covariantly under Poincaré symmetry, all operators in SMEFT must respect Poincaré symmetry (2). Thus, Poincaré symmetry (2) must also be respected.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model does not necessarily respect CP symmetry (e.g., CP violation is observed in the CKM matrix). Therefore, SMEFT operators can include terms that break CP symmetry. As a result, CP symmetry (3) is not a symmetry that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The Standard Model respects CPT symmetry, and SMEFT operators must also respect CPT symmetry because it is a fundamental symmetry of the SM. Hence, CPT symmetry (4) must be respected.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Among the given options, the correct choice is **C) 1,2,4**.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The Standard Model respects CPT symmetry, and SMEFT operators must also respect CPT symmetry because it is a fundamental symmetry of the SM. Hence, CPT symmetry (4) must be respected.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Among the given options, the correct choice is **C) 1,2,4**.
