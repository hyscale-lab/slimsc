Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem. Let me read it again and break it down step by step.

So, the setup is: an electron and a positron are moving along the horizontal axis. The electron is moving from the left, so that's to the right, and it has a Lorentz factor of 4. The positron is moving from the right, so that's to the left, with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. The photons have the same energy and their directions are measured. One is going upper-right, the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between them.

Hmm, okay. So first, I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons, and because energy and momentum must be conserved, the photons' directions and energies depend on the initial momenta of the particles.

Wait, so the electron and positron are moving towards each other. The electron has a Lorentz factor γ_e =4, and the positron's is γ_p=2. But wait, Lorentz factor is gamma, which is 1/sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)). So higher gamma means higher velocity. So the electron is moving faster than the positron? Wait, no, because gamma depends on velocity. Wait, the electron is moving from left to right, positron from right to left. So their velocities are in opposite directions.

But when they annihilate, the system's total momentum must be conserved. So I think I need to calculate the total momentum before annihilation and then see how the photons' momenta add up to that.

I remember that the momentum of a relativistic particle is given by p = gamma * m * v. Alternatively, since for a photon, energy E = pc, and E = hf. But in this case, the particles are electron and positron, so their rest mass is m_e. But wait, the positron is the antimatter counterpart, so it has the same mass as the electron, m_e.

So the initial momentum of the electron is gamma_e * m_e * v_e. Similarly, the positron's momentum is gamma_p * m_e * v_p. But wait, their directions are opposite. So the electron's momentum is positive (to the right), and the positron's is negative (to the left), or vice versa? Wait, the positron is moving from right to left, so its velocity is negative relative to the electron's direction.

Wait, let's set up a coordinate system. Let me assume the positive x-direction is to the right. So the electron is moving along +x, and the positron along -x.

So the electron's momentum is p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e. The positron's momentum is p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p. But since the positron is moving to the left, v_p is negative. So p_p would be negative.

Wait, but wait, the velocities v_e and v_p can be determined from their gamma factors. Because gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)). So v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

Let me compute v_e and v_p separately.

For the electron: gamma_e =4. So v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(4^2)) = c * sqrt(1 - 1/16) = c * sqrt(15/16) = c * (sqrt(15)/4) ≈ 0.968 c.

Similarly, for the positron: gamma_p =2. v_p = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(2^2)) = c * sqrt(3/4) = c*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈ 0.866 c.

But since the positron is moving to the left, its velocity is negative. So in terms of momentum, the electron's is positive, and the positron's is negative.

Wait, but wait. Oh, wait, since momentum is a vector, the positron's momentum is in the opposite direction, so p_p = gamma_p * m_e * (-v_p).

Wait, but wait again. The positron's velocity is to the left, so yes, it's negative in our coordinate system.

So the total initial momentum is p_total = p_e + p_p.

Let me compute p_e and p_p.

First, p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e.

Similarly, p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p, but since v_p is negative, p_p is negative.

Wait, but wait, the positron's velocity is to the left, so v_p = - (gamma_p's v). Alternatively, perhaps I should model the electron as moving in +x, the positron in -x, so their velocities have opposite signs. So let me compute p_e and p_p.

p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e (v_e positive)
p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p (v_p negative)

So p_total = p_e + p_p.

But wait, let's compute each term numerically.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the momentum in terms of gamma and m_e, without computing v. Because for a given gamma, p = gamma * m_e * v = gamma * m_e * c * sqrt(1 -1/gamma²).

Wait, let me express p in terms of gamma and m_e.

p = gamma * m_e * v = gamma * m_e * c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²) = m_e c sqrt( gamma² (1 - 1/gamma²) ) )

Hmm, wait, let's compute that.

p = gamma * m_e * v.

v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2).

So p = gamma * m_e * c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2) = m_e c sqrt( gamma² (1 - 1/gamma^2) )

Simplify inside the square root: gamma² (1 - 1/gamma^2 ) = gamma² -1.

So p = m_e c sqrt( gamma² - 1 )

Ah, that's a neat formula. So for each particle, p = m_e c sqrt( gamma^2 - 1 )

So for the electron:

gamma_e =4 → p_e = m_e c sqrt(16 -1 )= m_e c sqrt(15) ≈ m_e c * 3.872.

For the positron:

gamma_p =2 → p_p = m_e c sqrt(4 -1 )= m_e c sqrt(3) ≈ m_e c *1.732.

But wait, the positron is moving to the left, so the momentum is negative. So p_p = - m_e c sqrt(3).

So the total initial momentum is p_e + p_p = (m_e c sqrt(15) ) + ( - m_e c sqrt(3) )

= m_e c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) )

Now, let me compute that numerically.

sqrt(15) is about 3.872, sqrt(3)=1.732.

3.872 - 1.732 ≈ 2.14. So p_total ≈ m_e c * 2.14.

So the total momentum is in the positive x-direction.

After the annihilation, two photons are produced. Let's denote their momenta as p1 and p2.

Photons have momentum p = E/c, and their direction is determined by the angle from the x-axis.

The problem says that the photons have the same energy. So E1 = E2 = E.

Each photon's momentum is E/c, but their directions are such that one is upper-right (angle θ above +x) and the other is lower-right (angle θ below +x), but wait, wait. The problem says one is moving upper-right, the other lower-right. So it's symmetric about the x-axis.

Wait, the question says one is upper-right and the other lower-right. So their angles with the x-axis are θ and -θ, perhaps.

So the two photons have the same energy, so same magnitude of momentum (p = E/c), but their directions make angles θ and -θ with the x-axis.

Wait, but wait. The photons are moving in opposite vertical directions but same horizontal direction? Or is that not necessarily the case?

Wait, in the problem statement, it says one photon is moving upper-right, another lower-right. So both are moving to the right, but one is above the x-axis, another below—so their directions are symmetric with respect to the x-axis.

Wait, but if both are moving to the right, their x-components of momentum are in the same direction. So their x-momentum would add up, while their y-momentum would be in opposite directions, possibly canceling each other.

But wait, the initial total momentum is along the x-axis. So the total momentum after annihilation must also be along the x-axis. Since the two photons' momenta must add up to p_total.

So let's model this.

Each photon's momentum can be represented as vectors.

Photon 1: p1 has magnitude E/c, at angle θ above +x.
Photon 2: p2 has magnitude E/c, at angle -θ below +x.

So the x-components of p1 and p2 are (E/c) cosθ and (E/c) cosθ respectively.

The y-components are (E/c) sinθ and -(E/c) sinθ.

So the total y-momentum would be p1y + p2y = (E/c) sinθ - (E/c) sinθ = 0. Which is good because the initial y-momentum is zero.

The total x-momentum after annihilation is p1x + p2x = (E/c) cosθ + (E/c) cosθ = 2 (E/c) cosθ.

But the initial x-momentum was p_total = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

So 2 (E/c) cosθ = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

We can solve for cosθ.

But wait, I think we can relate E to the initial energy as well.

The total energy before annihilation is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron.

Each particle's energy is gamma * m_e c^2. So the electron's energy is 4 m_e c^2, and the positron's is 2 m_e c^2. So total energy before annihilation is (4 +2) m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2.

After annihilation, the total energy of the photons must be the same. Since each photon has energy E, the total is 2E. So 2E =6 m_e c^2 → E=3 m_e c^2.

Wait, that's a key point. So E is 3 m_e c^2 for each photon.

Wait, but wait, wait. Photons' energy is E = pc (since for photons, E = pc). So each photon's energy is E = p c.

So each photon has energy E =3 m_e c^2, so their momentum is p = E/c =3 m_e c.

Wait, so each photon's momentum is 3 m_e c in the direction specified.

Wait, so each photon's momentum is 3 m_e c, and their angles are θ and -θ relative to the x-axis.

So the x-components are 3 m_e c cosθ each.

So total x-momentum after annihilation is 2 * (3 m_e c cosθ ) = 6 m_e c cosθ.

This must equal the initial total momentum, which was m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

So:

6 m_e c cosθ = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

We can cancel m_e c from both sides:

6 cosθ = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).

Compute the right-hand side numerically.

sqrt(15)=3.87298, sqrt(3)=1.73205.

So sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈ 3.87298 -1.73205 ≈ 2.14093.

So:

6 cosθ ≈ 2.14093 → cosθ ≈ 2.14093 /6 ≈ 0.35682.

So θ ≈ arccos(0.35682) → approximately 69 degrees (since cos(60)=0.5, cos(70)=0.3420, which is a bit lower. Let me compute more accurately.

Wait, let me compute using a calculator.

cos(theta) ≈ 0.35682.

Take arccos of that. Let me think.

I know that cos(69°) is about 0.3584. Hmm, 0.3568 is a bit less than that, so theta would be a bit larger than 69 degrees.

Wait, let me compute: 69 degrees is 0.3584. The value is 0.3568, which is slightly less, so angle is about 69.3 degrees. Alternatively, perhaps more accurately, using a calculator.

But perhaps I can compute it more accurately.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier. Let me recheck.

Wait, initially, the total momentum before annihilation was p_total = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Which is approximately m_e c (3.87298 - 1.73205)= m_e c (2.14093).

So when I set 6 m_e c cosθ = m_e c (2.14093), I can cancel m_e c, leading to 6 cosθ = 2.14093.

Divide both sides by 6: cosθ = 2.14093 /6 ≈ 0.35682.

So θ ≈ arccos(0.35682).

Calculating this, let me recall that cos(70 degrees) is about 0.3420, cos(69) is about 0.3584.

So 0.3568 is between cos(69) and cos(70). Let me calculate the angle for 0.3568.

Using a calculator approximation:

Let me compute the angle θ:

cosθ = 0.3568.

θ ≈ 69 degrees. Wait, because cos(69) is about 0.3584, which is a little higher than 0.3568. So, perhaps the angle is about 69.1 degrees, but perhaps for more precision, let's compute.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use some trigonometric identities or a calculator.

But wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can proceed with exact expressions.

Wait, but the question is about the angle between the two photons. Since one is at angle θ above the x-axis and the other is at angle θ below, the angle between them would be 2θ.

Wait, because the angle between the two is from θ above to θ below, which is 2θ.

So, if θ is approximately 69 degrees, then the angle between them would be about 138 degrees.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is 138 degrees. So that's probably the correct answer.

But let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculation.

Wait, let's recap.

Total initial momentum: p_total = (gamma_e - gamma_p) * m_e c sqrt(1 - (1/gamma_e^2)) ?

Wait, no, wait.

Wait, the momentum of the electron is p_e = gamma_e * m_e v_e.

v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma_e^2) = c * sqrt(1 - 1/16) = c * sqrt(15/16) = (c * sqrt(15))/4.

So p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e = 4 m_e * (c sqrt(15)/4 )= m_e c sqrt(15).

Similarly, the positron's momentum is p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p.

v_p = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma_p^2) = c * sqrt(3/4) = c * sqrt(3)/2.

But since the positron is moving in the opposite direction, v_p is negative. So p_p = gamma_p * m_e * (-v_p) = 2 m_e * (-c * sqrt(3)/2 )= - m_e c sqrt(3).

So p_total = p_e + p_p = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Which is correct.

After annihilation, the two photons have equal energy E=3 m_e c^2, as the total energy is 6 m_e c^2, so each has 3 m_e c^2.

Thus, their momentum magnitude is p = E/c =3 m_e c.

Each photon's momentum is a vector with magnitude 3 m_e c, making angles θ and -θ with the x-axis.

The sum of the x-components is 2*(3 m_e c cosθ ) =6 m_e c cosθ.

Set this equal to the initial p_total, which is m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

So 6 cosθ = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) → cosθ = (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3))/6.

Compute this: sqrt(15) is about 3.872, sqrt(3)=1.732.

3.872 -1.732 =2.140. 2.140/6≈0.3567.

So θ = arccos(0.3567)≈69 degrees.

So the angle between them is 2*69 ≈138 degrees.

Looking at the options, option C is 138 degrees.

Hmm, but wait, in the problem statement, the photons are moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions. So their angles with the x-axis are θ and -θ. Therefore, the angle between them is 2θ.

Yes, that makes sense. So the angle between them is 2θ, which is approximately 138 degrees.

To solve the problem, we analyze the situation using conservation of energy and momentum. The electron and positron are moving along the horizontal axis, with Lorentz factors $\gamma_e = 4$ and $\gamma_p = 2$, respectively. Upon annihilation, they produce two photons of equal energy, moving in directions symmetric about the $x$-axis.

### Step 1: Initial Momentum
The momentum of a relativistic particle is given by:

\[
p = \gamma m_e c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
\]

For the electron:
\[
p_e = \gamma_e m_e c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_e^2}} = 4 m_e c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{16}} = m_e c \sqrt{15}
\]

For the positron:
\[
p_p = \gamma_p m_e c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_p^2}} = 2 m_e c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{4}} = m_e c \sqrt{3}
\]

Since the positron is moving to the left, its momentum is negative:
\[
p_p = -m_e c \sqrt{3}
\]

The total initial momentum is:
\[
p_{\text{total}} = p_e + p_p = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3})
\]

### Step 2: Energy Conservation
The total energy before annihilation is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = \gamma_e m_e c^2 + \gamma_p m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2
\]

After annihilation, the total energy is shared equally between the two photons:
\[
E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{total}}}{2} = 3 m_e c^2
\]

Since the energy of a photon is related to its momentum by $E = pc$, the momentum of each photon is:
\[
p_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{photon}}}{c} = 3 m_e c
\]

### Step 3: Momentum Conservation
The photons move symmetrically about the $x$-axis, making angles $\theta$ and $-\theta$ with the $x$-axis. The $x$-components of their momenta are:
\[
p_{1x} = 3 m_e c \cos\theta, \quad p_{2x} = 3 m_e c \cos\theta
\]

The total $x$-momentum after annihilation is:
\[
p_{\text{total, x}} = p_{1x} + p_{2x} = 2 (3 m_e c \cos\theta) = 6 m_e c \cos\theta
\]

Equating this to the initial total momentum:
\[
6 m_e c \cos\theta = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3})
\]

Canceling $m_e c$:
\[
6 \cos\theta = \sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}
\]

### Step 4: Solve for $\theta$
The right-hand side is:
\[
\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3} \approx 3.872 - 1.732 = 2.140
\]

Thus:
\[
\cos\theta = \frac{2.140}{6} \approx 0.3567
\]

Taking the arccosine:
\[
\theta \approx \arccos(0.3567) \approx 69^\circ
\]

### Step 5: Angle Between the Photons
The angle between the two photons is twice the angle $\theta$, as one photon is at $+\theta$ and the other at $-\theta$:
\[
\text{Angle between photons} = 2\theta \approx 2 \times 69^\circ = 138^\circ
\]

### Final Answer:
The angle between the directions of the photons is **138 degrees**.
