Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts yet. Let's try to think through it step by step.

The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given as V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². I remember that this is similar to the three-dimensional version of the quantum harmonic oscillator. 

The problem asks for two things: the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions with the same energy eigenvalue. The options are given as A to D.

First, I need to recall the energy levels of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. I think that in three dimensions, the energy levels are quantized and depend on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Oh wait, right! For a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is a non-negative integer (n = 0,1,2,...). But wait, no, that's not exactly right. Because in three dimensions, each direction contributes a quantum number, say n_x, n_y, n_z. The total energy is the sum of each direction's energy.

Wait, another approach: the energy levels can be characterized by the principal quantum number n, which is related to the sum of the individual quantum numbers. For 3D, the energy is E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω, where each n_i is a non-negative integer. But I also remember that the energy depends on the total quantum number N = n_x + n_y + n_z. Because for each N, the energy would be E = (N + 3/2) ħω.

So, the ground state is N=0, first excited state is N=1, second is N=2, third is N=3. Wait, but wait, are these the same as the excited states of the 3D oscillator? Let me think. The ground state is the lowest energy, which is N=0, then first excited is N=1, second is N=2, third is N=3.

So the third excited state would correspond to N=3. So the energy would be E = (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. That's the first part of the answer.

Now, the second part is the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions with the same energy eigenvalue. That is, the degeneracy for N=3.

In three dimensions, the degeneracy (the number of distinct eigenfunctions) for a given N is given by the formula (N + 2 choose 2) or (N+2)(N+1)/2. Wait, I think that's correct. Because for each N, the number of ways to write N as n_x + n_y + n_z, where each n_i is a non-negative integer, is (N + 3 -1 choose 3 -1) ) = (N+2 choose 2). So for N=3, the degeneracy is (3+2)(3+1)/2? Wait, no, (N+2 choose 2) is (5 choose 2) which is 10. So that's the number of eigenfunctions—the degeneracy is 10.

So the energy is (9/2) ħω and the number of eigenfunctions is 10.

Looking at the options:

Option A says (9/2) ħω, 10. That matches.

Option C says (9/2) ħω, 3. That's probably wrong because the degeneracy isn't 3. So the correct answer must be option A.

Wait, but let me make sure about the excited state numbering. Let me double-check: Ground state is N=0, which is the lowest energy. First excited state is N=1 (next higher), second is N=2, third is N=3. So yes, the third excited state is N=3. So energy is (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω.

So the correct answer is option A.

The problem involves a quantum mechanical system of a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, \( V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2 \). The energy levels of such a system are quantized and depend on the total quantum number \( N = n_x + n_y + n_z \), where \( n_x, n_y, n_z \) are the quantum numbers in the three spatial directions. The energy eigenvalues are given by:

\[
E = \left(N + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega,
\]

where \( N \) is a non-negative integer. The degeneracy (number of linearly independent eigenfunctions) corresponding to a given \( N \) is determined by the number of ways to partition \( N \) into \( n_x, n_y, n_z \), which is given by the combinatorial formula:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \binom{N + 2}{2} = \frac{(N + 2)(N + 1)}{2}.
\]

For the third excited state, \( N = 3 \) (since the ground state corresponds to \( N = 0 \), the first excited state to \( N = 1 \), the second to \( N = 2 \), and the third to \( N = 3 \)). Substituting \( N = 3 \) into the energy formula:

\[
E = \left(3 + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega.
\]

The degeneracy for \( N = 3 \) is:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \binom{3 + 2}{2} = \binom{5}{2} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2} = 10.
\]

Thus, the energy of the third excited state is \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega \), and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions is 10. Comparing with the options:

- **Option A**: \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega, 10 \) — Correct.
- **Option B**: \( \frac{11 \pi^2 \hbar^2}{2 m r^2}, 10 \) — Incorrect energy.
- **Option C**: \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega, 3 \) — Incorrect degeneracy.
- **Option D**: \( \frac{11 \pi^2 \hbar^2}{2 m r^2}, 3 \) — Incorrect energy and degeneracy.

The correct answer is **Option A**.
