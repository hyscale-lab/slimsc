Okay, so I've got this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, or SMEFT, and symmetries that operators must respect. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is a framework where we add higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model Lagrangian. These operators are organized by their dimension, like dimension 6, 8, etc.

The question is about which symmetries all operators in SMEFT must respect. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. Let me think about each one.

First, Lorentz symmetry. I think SMEFT is built with operators that are Lorentz-invariant. Because the Standard Model itself respects Lorentz symmetry, and SMEFT extends it, the operators should maintain that. So Lorentz symmetry is definitely a must.

Then Poincare symmetry. Wait, Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. But in a field theory, all terms must respect Poincare, including translation invariance. But how about SMEFT operators? Well, the operators in SMEFT are constructed as local operators, so they should respect Poincare symmetry. Wait, but wait. No, wait, SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory. Effective theories can sometimes break some symmetries if the high-energy physics breaks them. But wait, no. The effective operators are constructed to have the same symmetries as the underlying theory. Since the Standard Model respects Poincare, the SMEFT operators should too. So both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries must be respected. So that's options 1 and 2.

Next, CP symmetry. CP is charge conjugation plus parity. Does SMEFT respect CP? Well, the Standard Model doesn't exactly, because of things like CP violation in the CKM matrix. So if the SMEFT is just adding operators that can include CP violation, then the operators themselves don't have to respect CP. For example, dimension-6 operators like (S) and (T) parameters come from operators that can have CP violation. So not all SMEFT operators must respect CP symmetry. So option 3 is not a must.

Lastly, CPT symmetry. CPT is charge, parity, and time reversal. The Standard Model respects CPT, and so should SMEFT. Because if the high-energy theory that SMEFT is an effective description of respects CPT, then the effective operators should too. So all SMEFT operators must respect CPT.

Putting it all together: the symmetries that must be respected are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). Wait, but wait. Wait, Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. But in a Lagrangian, when you write down terms, you have to have translation invariance, which is part of Poincare. So all operators must respect Poincare, which includes Lorentz. But wait the question is which must be respected. So in the SMEFT, operators must respect all the symmetries of the Standard Model, except when the new physics explicitly breaks them.

Wait, but the question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So each operator must be a Lorentz scalar, which is part of Poincare. So 1 and 2 are both part of the same symmetry group. Wait, but Poincare is a bigger symmetry that includes Lorentz. So if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. But the question lists them as separate options. So which ones must be respected?

So in the SMEFT, all operators are required to be Lorentz scalars. Because the theory is built as such. So Lorentz symmetry (1) must be respected. Poincare symmetry (2) is also a requirement because that includes translation invariance, which all terms in the Lagrangian must respect. So both 1 and 2 must be respected.

So that leaves CPT (4) as a must. So the symmetries that must be respected are 1, 2, and 4. So looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. Option C is option C.

Wait, but the answer options are:

A) 1,2

B)3,4

C)1,2,4

D)1,3,4

So the correct answer would be option C: 1,2,4.

The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed with higher-dimensional operators that extend the Standard Model Lagrangian. These operators must respect certain symmetries, as dictated by the underlying principles of the theory.

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT operators are constructed as Lorentz scalars, meaning they must respect Lorentz symmetry. This is a fundamental requirement for any field theory.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translation invariance. Since SMEFT is a field theory, all terms in the Lagrangian must respect Poincaré symmetry, including translation invariance. Thus, Poincaré symmetry is also a requirement.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model already exhibits CP violation (e.g., in the CKM matrix). SMEFT operators can include terms that violate CP symmetry, so CP symmetry is not a strict requirement for all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in the Standard Model and, by extension, in SMEFT. Any effective theory derived from a high-energy theory that respects CPT symmetry must also respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
