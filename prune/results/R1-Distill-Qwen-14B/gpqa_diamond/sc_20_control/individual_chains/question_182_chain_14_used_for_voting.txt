Okay, so I've got this question about the Mott-Gurney equation. I'm a bit rusty on my solid-state physics, but let me think through this.

The question is about the conditions under which the Mott-Gurney equation is valid. The equation given is J = (9/8) * ε * μ * V² / L³. I remember that this equation describes the dark current in a semiconductor device when it's in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. 

Wait, what's SCLC again? Oh right, in SCLC, the current is limited by the space charge, meaning the electric field is so strong that the charge carriers are depleted from the region near the electrode. So it's like when you have a situation where the carriers are being pulled out so much that the space around the electrode doesn't have enough carriers left to support a higher current. This usually happens when the voltage is high enough that it's beyond the linear (ohmic) region but before you get into the more complex breakdown or other mechanisms.

Now, the equation itself... The variables are J (current density), ε (dielectric constant), μ (mobility), V (voltage), and L (length of the device—probably the thickness of the semiconductor material). 

The question is about the conditions for validity. The options talk about things like trap-free, single-carrier, Ohmic contact, Schottky contact, injection barriers, drift vs. diffusion currents, etc.

I remember that the Mott-Gurney equation assumes a single-carrier mechanism. So that means it's either electrons or holes, not both. So any option with two-carrier devices can probably be ruled out. Let me look at the options.

Option D says two-carrier device. So that's out. So D is probably incorrect.

The equation also assumes that the space charge is dominant, so it's in the SCLC regime. But the conditions in the options are about other aspects.

Ohmic contact vs. Schottky contact—what's the difference? Ohmic contacts have a low barrier, so they don't block carrier flow much. Schottky contacts have a built-in barrier that can block one type of carrier (like electrons in a p-type semiconductor if the contact is a Schottky barrier). So in a Schottky contact, carriers might have to overcome a barrier to inject.

Trap-free means no defects or impurities that can capture carriers, so charge doesn't get stuck. That's probably important because if there are traps, the current might not follow the Mott-Gurney equation as neatly.

Now, the equation assumes that the current is space-charge-limited, which implies that the electric field is strong enough that the space charge dominates. But under what other conditions does the equation hold?

I think the Mott-Gurney equation also assumes that the device is in the region where the current is limited by the space charge and that there's no significant injection of carriers from the contacts. So if there's an injection barrier, like a Schottky contact, that might affect the current.

Wait, but the equation is applicable when the injection of carriers is complete, meaning that the voltage is sufficient to inject all the carriers without any limitation, so the space charge is what's limiting the current. So that would probably require that the contacts are Ohmic, because if there's a barrier, maybe the voltage isn't enough to fully inject, but if it is, then the barrier is negligible.

Wait, but another thought: the Mott-Gurney equation is derived under the assumption that the carriers are fully injected from the contact, right? So if there's a Schottky barrier and the voltage isn't enough to overcome it, the current would be limited by the barrier, not the space charge. But once the voltage is high enough to inject, then the space charge becomes the limiting factor.

So, the equation assumes that the injection is happening because it's considering the current due to space charge. So the presence of an injection barrier (like Schottky) would mean that under low voltage, the current is limited by the barrier (like in the tunneling or field emission regimes). But once you reach the SCLC region, perhaps the injection is not a problem anymore because the voltage is high enough, so the Mott-Gurney equation would hold regardless of the contact type? Hmm, maybe not. Because the equation is about the space-charge-limited region, so the conditions are about that. So whether the contact is Schottky or Ohmic might not directly affect the validity of the equation once you're in the SCLC region. But wait, the equation's derivation might make certain assumptions about the contacts.

Alternatively, let me think about the derivation. I think the Mott-Gurney equation comes from considering a single type of carrier (so single-carrier device). Also, it assumes no traps because that would complicate the movement of carriers. So the device should be trap-free.

Another point: the equation assumes negligible drift current compared to the diffusion current, but wait, wait. No, wait. Let me think. In SCLC, the current is limited by the electric field created by the space charge. So in that case, drift is the main mechanism. Or wait, does the equation assume that diffusion is negligible?

Wait, no. Space-charge-limited current is when the space charge creates a strong electric field, leading to drift-dominated current. So if diffusion is significant, perhaps the Mott-Gurney equation wouldn't apply. So the equation's validity would require that diffusion is negligible.

Looking at the options, let's see which ones talk about diffusion and drift currents.

Option A: trap-free, single-carrier, Ohmic contact, negligible drift current.

Option B: trap-free, single-carrier, no injection barrier, negligible diffusion.

Option C: single-carrier, Schottky contact, negligible diffusion.

Option D: two-carrier, Ohmic, negligible diffusion.

Wait, so the Mott-Gurney equation is for the SCLC, which is a drift-dominated situation. So the drift current is dominant, which would suggest that diffusion is negligible. So the equation would require that diffusion currents are not significant.

Wait, but wait. Oh, no, in the space-charge-limited region, the current is due to the electric field, which causes drift movement. So the current is mainly drift. Therefore, the equation is valid when drift is the main mechanism. So if the option says 'negligible diffusion current', that would fit because in SCLC, drift is dominant. 

So looking at the options, which ones have 'negligible diffusion current'?

Option B says 'no carrier injection barrier' and 'negligible diffusion current'.

Option A says 'negligible drift'.

Wait, but this is getting a bit confusing.

Wait, in the Mott-Gurney regime, the current is space-charge-limited, which is drift-dominated. So drift is significant, but diffusion is not. So the presence of diffusion would mean that the current isn't as per Mott-Gurney.

So the equation would be valid when diffusion is negligible.

So which options have 'negligible diffusion'?

Looking at the options:

Option B: says 'no carrier injection barrier' and 'negligible diffusion current'. So that would fit because in the equation, the current is due to drift (since SCLC is drift), so diffusion is negligible.

But wait, the question is about the validity conditions. Let's break down each option.

Option A: trap-free, single-carrier, Ohmic contact, negligible drift.

Wait, if drift is negligible, then the current would be diffusion dominated. But Mott-Gurney is for drift. So if the equation is for drift (SCLC), then option A saying drift is negligible would mean it's not in the SCLC region. So option A would be invalid.

Option B: trap-free, single-carrier, no injection barrier, negligible diffusion. So if the device has no injection barrier, that would mean it's an Ohmic contact, I think. Because Ohmic contacts have low barriers, so carriers can be injected without significant voltage. So in that case, the current is limited by the space charge (so SCLC), and with no traps, which is good. And if diffusion is negligible, then it's drift-dominated. So this seems to fit.

Option C: single-carrier, Schottky contact, negligible diffusion. Schottky contacts have barriers. But if the voltage is high enough to overcome the barrier, then perhaps the Mott-Gurney equation would apply. But the presence of a Schottky contact implies a barrier, which could complicate things. Alternatively, maybe the equation doesn't care about the contact type as long as the space charge is dominant. But I'm not sure. The equation derivation might assume something about the contacts.

Option D: two-carrier, which I think is wrong because Mott-Gurney is single-carrier.

So narrowing down to options B and C.

Option B: no injection barrier (so Ohmic), trap-free, single-carrier, negligible diffusion. That seems good because in that case, the current is due to drift (since diffusion is negligible) and the space charge is dominant.

Option C: Schottky contact. But Schottky implies a barrier. So if the device has a Schottky contact, would that affect the validity? If the barrier is high, maybe the current is limited by the barrier, not the space charge. But the Mott-Gurney equation is valid when the space charge is limiting, implying high enough voltage to overcome any barriers.

Alternatively, maybe the equation applies regardless of the contact type as long as the SCLC condition holds. But the equation's derivation probably assumes Ohmic contacts because the derivation may not account for barriers.

Wait, the Mott-Gurney equation is for the case where the current is limited by the space charge, regardless of the contact. So maybe the contact type doesn't matter as long as it's a single-carrier, trap-free, and in the SCLC region.

But looking back at the options, the options are about the validity conditions, which include the contact type.

So if the option includes a Schottky contact, which introduces a barrier, that might imply that the current is injection-limited, not space-charge-limited. But in the Mott-Gurney equation, the current is beyond the injection limit. So maybe the equation assumes that the carrier injection is complete, meaning that you're in the SCLC region. So in that case, whether the contact is Schottky or Ohmic doesn't affect the validity, as long as you've passed the injection barrier. But the equation is more about the space-charge effect.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation requires that the injection is not an issue, implying that the contact is Ohmic. Because if it's a Schottky contact, the injection might limit the current at lower voltages, but once the voltage is high enough to cause SCLC, the contact type may not matter. But I'm not sure.

Let me think about the Mott-Gurney equation's derivation. I think it assumes that the device is single-carrier, that carrier injection is complete (so the contacts are Ohmic, or the voltage is high enough to inject), and that the current is limited by the space charge. The derivation also assumes no traps, negligible recombination, and that the mobility is constant (so μ is a constant).

So the equation doesn't depend on whether the contact is Ohmic or Schottky as long as the SCLC condition is met. But the options include contact types.

Looking at the options again:

Option B states "no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current." So no injection barrier would mean an Ohmic contact. So when the contact is Ohmic, the injection is not a problem. So the equation holds because the current is limited by space charge, not injection. So that makes sense.

Option C has a Schottky contact but says negligible diffusion. But a Schottky contact implies a barrier, so unless the voltage is high enough to overcome it, the current would be limited by the barrier. But if the voltage is so high that the barrier is easily overcome and the space charge is the limiting factor, then maybe the equation is valid. But I'm not sure if the equation's derivation assumes Ohmic contacts or if it's independent of contact type as long as SCLC conditions hold.

Wait, another thought: the Mott-Gurney equation comes from the theory where the space charge creates a potential profile, and the current is determined by the movement of carriers under that electric field. The presence of a Schottky barrier would affect the potential profile at the contact, but if the bulk of the device is trap-free and the contacts are such that the potential can adjust to allow SCLC, perhaps the equation still applies.

But I'm probably overcomplicating this. Let me look for another angle.

The equation J = (9/8) ε μ V² / L³ is derived under the assumption of a single carrier type, no traps, and the current is space-charge-limited. It assumes that the electric field is strong enough that the space charge dominates, which is the SCLC condition. The equation also assumes that the injection is complete, meaning that the carriers are fully injected from the contact. If the contact has a barrier (like Schottky), and the voltage is high enough to overcome the barrier, then the injection is complete, and the equation can still apply.

But some derivations of the Mott-Gurney equation assume that the contacts are Ohmic, so that the electric field starts right at the contact. If the contact is a Schottky barrier, the electric field profile is more complicated because of the barrier. So perhaps the equation is more accurately applicable when the contacts are Ohmic, making the potential drop occur across the bulk of the semiconductor, not the contact.

So, in that case, the correct option would be the one that includes Ohmic contacts.

Looking at the options, option B says "no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current." So no injection barrier would mean Ohmic contacts, which fits with the equation being applicable.

So option B would be the correct statement.

Wait, but option B also says "no carrier injection barrier." If there's no injection barrier, that aligns with Ohmic contact because the barrier is low. So that makes sense.

Alternatively, option A says "Ohmic contact and negligible drift current."

Wait, no. If drift is negligible, the current would be diffusion dominated. But Mott-Gurney is for drift. So option A is wrong.

So the correct statement is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current (J) versus voltage (V) behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. The equation is valid under specific conditions, including a single-carrier mechanism, trap-free material, and negligible diffusion current. The derivation assumes that the current is dominated by drift due to the electric field created by the space charge, and that carrier injection is complete, meaning the voltage is sufficient to overcome any injection barriers.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A**: States that the equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current. However, the Mott-Gurney equation is drift-dominated, not diffusion-dominated. If drift is negligible, the current would be diffusion-limited, and the equation would not apply. Thus, this option is incorrect.

2. **Option B**: States that the equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current. This aligns with the conditions for the SCLC regime, where the current is limited by the space charge, and diffusion is negligible. The absence of a carrier injection barrier implies an Ohmic contact, ensuring complete carrier injection. This option is consistent with the assumptions of the Mott-Gurney equation.

3. **Option C**: States that the equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current. A Schottky contact introduces a barrier, which could limit the current at lower voltages. However, the Mott-Gurney equation assumes that the current is limited by the space charge, not by injection barriers. While the equation might still apply at high voltages where the barrier is negligible, the presence of a Schottky contact complicates the potential profile and is inconsistent with the standard assumptions of the equation. Thus, this option is less likely to be correct.

4. **Option D**: States that the equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current. The Mott-Gurney equation is derived for single-carrier devices, not two-carrier systems. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier (implying an Ohmic contact) and negligible diffusion current. This is best described by **Option B**.
