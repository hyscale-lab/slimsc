Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light diffraction through an aperture shaped like a polygon. Hmm, I remember from my optics class that when light passes through a small aperture, it diffracts and creates a pattern of bright and dark spots called interference maxima and minima. But wait, this is a bit different because the aperture is a N-sided polygon, right?

The question says all apothems are the same length a. Oh, right, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So for a regular polygon, all the apothems are equal. And N is infinitely large, which probably means the aperture becomes a circle. Oh wait, but wait, no—wait, an N-sided polygon with all apothems the same? That would be a regular polygon, right. So when N is very large, the polygon becomes a circle. But the problem is about the diffraction pattern in the far field when the light is incident along the z-axis, so the pattern would be observed on a screen perpendicular to the z-axis.

Wait, but if N is infinitely large, it's a circular aperture, and the diffraction pattern is the familiar Airy disk. But wait, the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. Wait, for a circular aperture, the first minimum is at an angle θ given by a sinθ = λ, but wait, no, I think it's a sinθ = 1.22 λ because the first minimum in the Airy pattern is at that condition. So the angular distance between the first two minima, wait, but in the case of a circle, the minima are at multiples of π beyond the central maximum, right? So the first minimum is at 1.22 λ/a, the next at 2.44, etc. So the angular distance between first and second minima would be 1.22 λ/a, which is option C. But wait, the problem says the polygon is N-sided, and N is approaching infinity, so it's a circle. So maybe the answer is C.

But wait, the problem says 'angular distance between the first two minima.' Wait, the first minimum is the first dark fringe after the central maximum. So for a circular aperture, the first dark ring is at θ = 1.22 λ/(a), where a is the radius. But wait, wait—wait, the apothem a of a regular polygon is the radius of the inscribed circle. So for a polygon with N sides, the apothem a is the distance from the center to the middle of a side. So when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle, and the apothem a becomes the radius of the circle. So in that case, the formula for the first minimum would be a sinθ = 1.22 λ. Since the angles are small, sinθ ≈ θ (in radians), so θ ≈ 1.22 λ / a.

Wait, but in the options, C is 1.220 λ/a, which matches. But the options don't have that. Wait, looking back. The options are:

A) 0.610 λ / a
B) 0.500 λ / a
C) 1.220 λ /a 
D) 0.506 λ / a

So option C is 1.220 λ/a. That would be the angular position of the first minimum. But wait, the question is about the distance between the first two minima. Wait, no, the first two minima after the central maximum. The first minimum is at θ1=1.22 λ/a, the second at θ2=2.44 λ/a. So the distance between them would be θ2 - θ1 = 1.22 λ/a. So that's the same as the position of the first minimum. So the angular spacing is 1.22 λ/a.

So if the question is about the angular distance between the first and second minima, it's 1.22 λ/a, which matches option C. But wait, the question says "what is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large?" So that's the case for a circular aperture. So the answer should be option C.

But wait, the problem says the polygon's apothems are the same length a. So for a regular polygon, the apothem a is related to the radius R of the circumscribed circle (distance from center to vertex) as a = R cos(π/N). When N is large, cos(π/N) ≈ 1, so a ≈ R. So when N approaches infinity, the apothem a is equal to R, the radius of the circle. So the formula as before.

Wait, but wait another thought: the formula a sinθ = λ gives the minima for a single slit. But for a circular aperture, the first minimum is at a sinθ = 1.22 λ. So the angle for the first minimum is θ≈1.22 λ/a, since a is the radius (apothem in the circle case). So the angular distance between the first two minima is 1.22 λ/a, which would be option C. So the answer is C.

When a monochromatic light of wavelength $\lambda$ falls vertically on an aperture shaped like a regular N-sided polygon with all apothems equal to $a$, the diffraction pattern in the far field region is determined by the angular positions of the intensity minima. For a regular polygon, the apothem $a$ is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. When $N$ is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle, and the apothem $a$ corresponds to the radius of the circle.

For a circular aperture, the angular positions of the minima in the diffraction pattern are given by $a \sin\theta = 1.22 \lambda$, where $\theta$ is the angle from the central maximum. Using the small-angle approximation $\sin\theta \approx \theta$, the first minimum occurs at $\theta_1 = 1.22 \lambda / a$, and the second minimum occurs at $\theta_2 = 2.44 \lambda / a$. The angular distance between the first two minima is therefore:

\[
\theta_2 - \theta_1 = 1.22 \lambda / a
\]

This matches the angular spacing between the first two minima for a circular aperture. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**C) $1.220 \lambda / a$**
