Okay, so I've got this problem here about an alien spacecraft traveling at a super high speed towards Earth. Hmm, I remember from my physics class that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation comes into play. Time dilation is that thing from Einstein's theory of relativity where time passes slower for the moving object compared to a stationary one.

The question says the average lifetime of these aliens is about 150 solar years. Their spacecraft is going at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The astronaut is 22 years old, and I need to find out how long it will take for them to reach Earth from their own perspective.

Wait, so first, I think I need to calculate the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. Oh wait, but wait, I'm not sure about the exact distance. I remember the Large Magellanic Cloud is one of the satellite galaxies of the Milky Way, and it's about 160,000 light-years away. Or was it 170,000? I think it's approximately 163,000 light-years. But maybe that's not crucial right now because the problem is about time experienced by the astronaut, not the actual time from Earth's perspective.

Wait, but wait. The problem is in the astronaut's frame of reference. So from their perspective, the distance to Earth would be length-contracted. Length contraction is another relativistic effect where objects moving relative to you appear shorter in the direction of motion.

The formula for length contraction is L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where L0 is the proper length (distance in the stationary frame, like Earth's frame), and L is the contracted length in the spacecraft's frame.

So let's get the numbers straight. The speed v is given as 0.99999987*c. That's really, really close to the speed of light. Let me compute the gamma factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). For v very close to c, gamma is very large. Gamma is the time dilation factor.

Wait, but in the astronaut's frame, the distance is contracted, so the time taken would be (contracted distance) / v.

Alternatively, the time experienced by the astronaut (proper time) can be calculated using the time dilation formula. Wait, but wait, the proper time is the time experienced by the traveler, so tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where t is the time in Earth's frame.

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the time from Earth's frame first, then apply time dilation to find the astronaut's experienced time.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the time from the astronaut's perspective. So let's approach this step by step.

First, calculate the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. Let's assume it's approximately 160,000 light-years. But wait, the exact number might not be necessary because the options are in the tens of years, so perhaps the question is more about the relativistic effects than the actual distance.

Wait, but if the spacecraft is going at 0.99999987c, the time taken from Earth's frame would be distance divided by speed. Let's denote the distance as D. So t = D / v.

But from the astronaut's frame, time will be less due to time dilation. So from their perspective, the time taken is tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, but another way to think about it is that the astronaut's own clock will run slower, so the time they experience is less than the time we observe from Earth.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the time as experienced by the astronaut, which is the proper time. The proper time equation is tau = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, but wait, another approach: The proper time is the time measured in the moving frame, which would be the spacecraft's frame. So tau is the time experienced by the astronaut.

So, tau = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

But first, I need t_earth, the time it takes for the spacecraft to reach Earth according to Earth's frame.

Assuming the distance is D, then t_earth = D / v.

But what is D? Let me think. The Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 light-years away. So D = 160,000 light-years.

So t_earth = (160,000 light-years) / (0.99999987 * c). Since one light-year is the distance light travels in a year, so light-year divided by c (speed of light) is just time in years.

Wait, so 1 light-year / c = 1 year. So t_earth = (160,000 ly) / (0.99999987 c) * (1 year / ly) * (c / c) )= (160,000 / 0.99999987) years.

Let me compute that.

0.99999987 is very close to 1, so 160000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160000 * (1 + 1e-7) ) approximately. Let's calculate 160000 / (0.99999987) = 160000 / (1 - 0.13e-6) approximately. Wait, 0.99999987 is 1 - 1.3e-7, which is 1.3e-7 less than 1.

Wait, perhaps I can approximate this division. Since 0.99999987 is very close to 1, 160000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160000 * (1 + 1.3e-7) ≈ 160000 + 160000 * 1.3e-7.

Wait, let me compute 160000 * 1.3e-7. 160000 is 1.6e5. 1.6e5 * 1.3e-7 = (1.6 * 1.3) * 1e-2 = 2.08e-2 ≈ 0.0208 years.

So t_earth ≈ 160000 + 0.0208 ≈ 160000.0208 years. Wait, that's about 160,000 years from Earth's perspective.

But wait, that's way longer than the astronaut's lifetime. The astronaut is 22 years old, and their average lifetime is 150 years. So from Earth's frame, it would take about 160,000 years, but that can't be right because from the astronaut's perspective, it's much shorter.

Wait, this suggests that using the Earth frame's time is t_earth = 160,000 years. Then, the astronaut's experienced time tau = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

But v is 0.99999987 c, so v²/c² = (0.99999987)^2 ≈ 0.99999974.

So 1 - v²/c² ≈ 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026.

So sqrt(0.00000026) = sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 5.1e-4. Let me check: 5.1e-4 squared is about 2.6e-7. Yes.

So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ 5.1e-4.

So tau ≈ 160,000 years * 5.1e-4 ≈ 81.6 years.

Wait, so the astronaut would experience about 81.6 years. So the options are looking for approximately that. The options are B)72, C)81, D)77. So 81 is option C.

But wait, let me make sure. Because perhaps the distance is different.

Wait, the question says that the astronaut is 22 years old, and the average lifetime is 150 years. So from the astronaut's perspective, they have about 150-22 = 128 years left on average. But in this scenario, their experienced time is about 81 years. So 81 years is less than their average lifetime, so they might survive.

Wait, but what about the calculation? Let me double-check the numbers.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing t_earth. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, the speed is 0.99999987 c, which is very close to c, so the time from Earth's perspective is D/(v) = (160,000 ly)/(0.99999987 c) = 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 * (1 + 1.3e-7) ≈ 160,000 + 0.0208 ≈ 160,000.0208 years. So it's about 160,000 years as per Earth.

Then, the proper time tau is t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

v² = (0.99999987)^2 c² ≈ 0.99999974 c².

1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026.

So sqrt(0.00000026) ≈ 5.099e-4, approximately 5.1e-4.

So tau = 160000 * 5.1e-4 = 160000 * 0.00051 = 81.6 years.

So the astronaut would experience about 81.6 years. So the options are 81 years as option C.

But wait, the astronaut is 22 years old. So 81 years added to 22 would make them 103, but their average lifetime is 150. So they would live long enough. So the answer would be option C, 81 years.

But let me think again. Is there a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, another approach: using time dilation formula.

The time experienced by the astronaut (tau) is the Earth time multiplied by sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So tau ≈ t_earth * 5.1e-4.

But t_earth is 160000 years, so 160000 * 5.1e-4 = 81.6 years.

Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps using the Lorentz factor. The gamma factor is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). For v = 0.99999987 c, gamma is 1/(sqrt(0.00000026)) → 1/(approx 5.1e-4) → about 1960.7.

Wait, that's a big gamma. So the Earth time is 160,000 * gamma? No, wait, gamma is the factor by which time dilates. So Earth time is t_earth, and the astronaut's time is tau = t_earth / gamma. Because tau = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), and sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is 1/gamma.

So yes, tau = t_earth / gamma.

So gamma = 1/(5.1e-4) ≈ 1960.78.

So tau = 160000 / 1960.78 ≈ 81.5 years. Same as before.

So the astronaut would experience about 81.5 years, which is about 81 years, so option C.

But wait, the astronaut is 22. So adding 81 years would make them 103, which is within their 150-year lifespan. So they should survive, so the answer would be 81 years.

Wait, but the options are:

A) Astronaut dies before reaching.

B)72

C)81

D)77

So the correct answer is C)81.

Alternatively, perhaps the distance is different. Wait, the Large Magellanic Cloud is actually about 160,000 to 200,000 light-years away. But using 160,000 as the distance, we get about 81 years.

But wait, maybe the question is considering the distance as 160,000 light-years, and the speed is 0.99999987c, so the Earth time is about 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 years, which is correct.

Wait, but what if the question assumes that the time is from the astronaut's perspective, so they would age 81 years, which is answer C.

So the correct answer is C)81 years.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how long the astronaut will experience the journey to Earth, we must account for relativistic effects, specifically time dilation and length contraction. The spacecraft travels at a speed of \( v = 0.99999987c \), which is very close to the speed of light, so relativistic effects are significant.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Distance to Earth**: The Large Magellanic Cloud is approximately \( D = 160,000 \) light-years away from Earth.

2. **Time in Earth's Frame (\( t_{\text{Earth}} \))**:  
   The time it takes to travel this distance, as measured in Earth's frame, is:  
   \[
   t_{\text{Earth}} = \frac{D}{v} = \frac{160,000 \, \text{light-years}}{0.99999987c} \approx 160,000 \, \text{years}.
   \]

3. **Time Dilation Factor (\( \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} \))**:  
   The time experienced by the astronaut (\( \tau \)) is related to \( t_{\text{Earth}} \) by the time dilation formula:  
   \[
   \tau = t_{\text{Earth}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}.
   \]  
   For \( v = 0.99999987c \), we calculate:  
   \[
   \frac{v^2}{c^2} = (0.99999987)^2 \approx 0.99999974, \quad \text{so} \quad 1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} \approx 0.00000026.
   \]  
   Taking the square root:  
   \[
   \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \approx \sqrt{0.00000026} \approx 5.1 \times 10^{-4}.
   \]

4. **Astronaut's Experienced Time (\( \tau \))**:  
   Substituting into the time dilation formula:  
   \[
   \tau = 160,000 \cdot 5.1 \times 10^{-4} \approx 81.6 \, \text{years}.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The astronaut will experience approximately 81 years during the journey. Since the astronaut is 22 years old and their average lifetime is 150 years, they will survive the trip. Therefore, the correct answer is:

So t_earth = (160,000 light-years) / (0.99999987 * c). Since one light-year is the distance light travels in a year, so light-year divided by c (speed of light) is just time in years.

Wait, so 1 light-year / c = 1 year. So t_earth = (160,000 ly) / (0.99999987 c) * (1 year / ly) * (c / c) )= (160,000 / 0.99999987) years.

Let me compute that.

0.99999987 is very close to 1, so 160000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160000 * (1 + 1e-7) ) approximately. Let's calculate 160000 / (0.99999987) = 160000 / (1 - 0.13e-6) approximately. Wait, 0.99999987 is 1 - 1.3e-7, which is 1.3e-7 less than 1.

Wait, perhaps I can approximate this division. Since 0.99999987 is very close to 1, 160000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160000 * (1 + 1.3e-7) ≈ 160000 + 160000 * 1.3e-7.

Wait, let me compute 160000 * 1.3e-7. 160000 is 1.6e5. 1.6e5 * 1.3e-7 = (1.6 * 1.3) * 1e-2 = 2.08e-2 ≈ 0.0208 years.

So t_earth ≈ 160000 + 0.0208 ≈ 160000.0208 years. Wait, that's about 160,000 years from Earth's perspective.

But wait, that's way longer than the astronaut's lifetime. The astronaut is 22 years old, and their average lifetime is 150 years. So from Earth's frame, it would take about 160,000 years, but that can't be right because from the astronaut's perspective, it's much shorter.

Wait, this suggests that using the Earth frame's time is t_earth = 160,000 years. Then, the astronaut's experienced time tau = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

But v is 0.99999987 c, so v²/c² = (0.99999987)^2 ≈ 0.99999974.

So 1 - v²/c² ≈ 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026.

So sqrt(0.00000026) = sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 5.1e-4. Let me check: 5.1e-4 squared is about 2.6e-7. Yes.

So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ 5.1e-4.

So tau ≈ 160,000 years * 5.1e-4 ≈ 81.6 years.

Wait, so the astronaut would experience about 81.6 years. So the options are looking for approximately that. The options are B)72, C)81, D)77. So 81 is option C.

But wait, let me make sure. Because perhaps the distance is different.

Wait, the speed is 0.99999987 c, which is very close to c, so the time from Earth's perspective is D/(v) = (160,000 ly)/(0.99999987 c) = 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 * (1 + 1.3e-7) ≈ 160,000 + 0.0208 ≈ 160,000.0208 years. So it's about 160,000 years as per Earth.

Then, the proper time tau is t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

v² = (0.99999987)^2 c² ≈ 0.99999974 c².

1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026.

So sqrt(0.00000026) ≈ 5.099e-4, approximately 5.1e-4.

So tau = 160000 * 5.1e-4 = 160000 * 0.00051 = 81.6 years.

So the astronaut would experience about 81.6 years. So the options are 81 years as option C.

But wait, the astronaut is 22 years old. So 81 years added to 22 would make them 103, but their average lifetime is 150. So they would live long enough. So the answer would be option C, 81 years.

But t_earth is 160000 years, so 160000 * 5.1e-4 = 81.6 years.

Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps using the Lorentz factor. The gamma factor is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). For v = 0.99999987 c, gamma is 1/(sqrt(0.00000026)) → 1/(approx 5.1e-4) → about 1960.7.

Wait, that's a big gamma. So the Earth time is 160,000 * gamma? No, wait, gamma is the factor by which time dilates. So Earth time is t_earth, and the astronaut's time is tau = t_earth / gamma. Because tau = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), and sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is 1/gamma.

So yes, tau = t_earth / gamma.

So gamma = 1/(5.1e-4) ≈ 1960.78.

So tau = 160000 / 1960.78 ≈ 81.5 years. Same as before.

So the astronaut would experience about 81.5 years, which is about 81 years, so option C.

But wait, the astronaut is 22. So adding 81 years would make them 103, which is within their 150-year lifespan. So they should survive, so the answer would be 81 years.

Wait, but the options are:

A) Astronaut dies before reaching.

B)72

C)81

D)77

So the correct answer is C)81.

Alternatively, perhaps the distance is different. Wait, the Large Magellanic Cloud is actually about 160,000 to 200,000 light-years away. But using 160,000 as the distance, we get about 81 years.

But wait, maybe the question is considering the distance as 160,000 light-years, and the speed is 0.99999987c, so the Earth time is about 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 years, which is correct.

Wait, but what if the question assumes that the time is from the astronaut's perspective, so they would age 81 years, which is answer C.

So the correct answer is C)81 years.


To determine how long the astronaut will experience the journey to Earth, we must account for relativistic effects, specifically time dilation and length contraction. The spacecraft travels at a speed of \( v = 0.99999987c \), which is very close to the speed of light, so relativistic effects are significant.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Distance to Earth**: The Large Magellanic Cloud is approximately \( D = 160,000 \) light-years away from Earth.

2. **Time in Earth's Frame (\( t_{\text{Earth}} \))**:  
   The time it takes to travel this distance, as measured in Earth's frame, is:  
   \[
   t_{\text{Earth}} = \frac{D}{v} = \frac{160,000 \, \text{light-years}}{0.99999987c} \approx 160,000 \, \text{years}.
   \]

3. **Time Dilation Factor (\( \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} \))**:  
   The time experienced by the astronaut (\( \tau \)) is related to \( t_{\text{Earth}} \) by the time dilation formula:  
   \[
   \tau = t_{\text{Earth}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}.
   \]  
   For \( v = 0.99999987c \), we calculate:  
   \[
   \frac{v^2}{c^2} = (0.99999987)^2 \approx 0.99999974, \quad \text{so} \quad 1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} \approx 0.00000026.
   \]  
   Taking the square root:  
   \[
   \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \approx \sqrt{0.00000026} \approx 5.1 \times 10^{-4}.
   \]

4. **Astronaut's Experienced Time (\( \tau \))**:  
   Substituting into the time dilation formula:  
   \[
   \tau = 160,000 \cdot 5.1 \times 10^{-4} \approx 81.6 \, \text{years}.
   \]

The astronaut will experience approximately 81 years during the journey. Since the astronaut is 22 years old and their average lifetime is 150 years, they will survive the trip. Therefore, the correct answer is:
