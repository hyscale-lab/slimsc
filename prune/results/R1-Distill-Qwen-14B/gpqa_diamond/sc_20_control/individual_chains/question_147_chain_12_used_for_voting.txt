Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation processes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's try to think it through step by step.

The problem says: p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. Wait, no, wait, the particles are A⁺ and A⁻. Oh, right, because when particles annihilate, they produce other particles. So here, a proton and an antiproton are annihilating to produce two A⁺ and two A⁻.

And the given is that m_A c² is 300 MeV. Oh, right, because the rest mass energy of each A particle is 300 MeV. I remember that in these kinds of problems, conservation laws are key—probably conservation of energy and momentum.

Since the antiproton is moving slowly, I think that implies that it has low kinetic energy compared to its rest mass energy. Wait, but wait, no, the problem says the antiproton is "slowly moving." So maybe it's moving at a non-relativistic speed? Or perhaps it's a typo and they meant that it's moving at a speed much less than c, so we can approximate using non-relativistic equations. Or maybe not—because in particle physics, even slow-moving particles can be relativistic if their mass is high. Hmm, not sure yet.

But let's think about the setup. The initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. Protons have a rest mass of about 938 MeV/c². Same for antiprotons. So each has a rest energy of about 938 MeV. The annihilation process produces four A particles, two of each charge.

Wait, but the problem states that m_A c² is 300 MeV. So each A has a rest mass of 300 MeV. So the four A particles have a rest mass of 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV. The initial rest mass is (938 + 938) = 1876 MeV. So 1876 MeV is the initial rest mass energy, but after annihilation, the rest mass is 1200 MeV. So there's a lot of energy to be converted into kinetic energy.

But wait, since the process is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻, the initial particles are a proton and antiproton. So the total initial rest mass energy is m_p c² + m_p c² (since antiproton has same mass as proton). So that's 2 * 938 = 1876 MeV.

The final particles are four A particles, each 300 MeV, so 4*300 = 1200 MeV. So the rest mass energy of the products is less than the initial, which means that the products must have significant kinetic energy. Because in any case, the initial energy is higher than the rest mass of the products, so the products must be moving.

But the question is about the velocity of the particles A. So I think we're to find the speed of each A particle.

Wait, but the initial proton and antiproton: what about their motion? The problem says the antiproton is moving slowly. Hmm. So perhaps the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with some low speed. Or maybe the initial frame is the rest frame of the system.

Wait, the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly. So perhaps the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with a low speed, so that in the center of mass frame, things are manageable.

Wait, but the system's total energy would be the sum of the energies of the proton and the antiproton. If the proton is at rest, its energy is m_p c², and the antiproton's energy is gamma m_p c², where gamma is 1 or slightly higher because it's moving slowly. So the total initial energy is (1 + gamma) m_p c².

But in any case, for annihilation, the process should conserve both energy and momentum. Since the problem doesn't give any information about the kinetic energy of the antiproton, maybe I can assume that the initial momentum is that of the moving antiproton, and the proton is at rest. So the total initial momentum is the momentum of the antiproton.

But after annihilation, we have four particles. Wait, but the problem states that the products are 2A⁺ and 2A⁻. So perhaps they are moving in such a way that their momenta sum up to the initial momentum.

Wait, perhaps the process is symmetric, so the particles are produced in pairs. Like two A⁺ and two A⁻ moving in opposite directions, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe each pair (A⁺ and A⁻) moves together, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the system is symmetric, and each A particle is moving in a certain direction, but their momenta add up to the initial momentum of the antiproton.

Wait, but maybe I should think in terms of conservation of momentum and energy.

Let me outline the approach:

1. Assume that the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with velocity v. So, in the lab frame, the initial momentum is just that of the antiproton.

2. The total energy of the system is the sum of the proton's rest energy and the antiproton's total energy (kinetic + rest).

3. The total energy after annihilation is the sum of the energies of the four A particles, which includes their rest mass energy and their kinetic energy.

4. The momentum after annihilation must equal the initial momentum (which is just the antiproton's momentum).

But wait, the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, so perhaps v is small, so maybe it's in the non-relativistic limit. But given that the initial rest mass is higher than the final, the products must be moving relativistically, so that may not be the case. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the center of mass frame. In the center of mass frame, the initial total momentum is zero. So after annihilation, the total momentum must also be zero. But the products are four particles; perhaps they are moving symmetrically.

Wait, but the initial particles are a proton and antiproton. Let's compute the initial total energy and momentum in the center of mass frame.

In the center of mass frame, the total momentum is zero. So the total energy is the sum of their energies. Each has rest mass m_p, so in their rest frame, each has energy m_p c². But if they're moving towards each other with some velocity, their energies would be higher. Wait, but the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the center of mass frame is the frame where the total momentum is zero. So the initial momenta of proton and antiproton are equal and opposite. But if the antiproton is moving slowly, then the proton might be moving in the opposite direction with a similar speed. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial frame is the rest frame of the proton. So the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with a low speed. So the total initial momentum is that of the antiproton.

After annihilation, we have four A particles. Let's assume that all four particles are moving in the same direction as the initial antiproton. But that's probably not correct because of momentum conservation. Alternatively, maybe the four particles are moving symmetrically so that their total momentum equals the initial momentum.

Wait, but perhaps the process is such that the four particles are produced symmetrically, like two pairs moving in opposite directions. For example, two A⁺ and two A⁻ moving in opposite directions. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps each A⁺ moves in one direction and each A⁻ in the opposite, but that's getting complicated.

Hmm. Maybe I should model this with conservation of energy and momentum, considering that all four particles are moving in the same direction after the collision, which doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe two A⁺ are moving in one direction and two A⁻ in the opposite, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the products are moving with the same velocity, but in the same direction. That would make the math easier.

Wait, perhaps in the rest frame of the proton, the initial momentum is just that of the antiproton. After annihilation, the four A particles must have a total momentum equal to the initial momentum of the antiproton.

But if all four A particles are moving in the same direction, their momenta would add up, and we can find their velocity based on that.

Wait, but that's a big assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the products are moving symmetrically, so that their momenta cancel each other except for a net momentum equal to the initial. Let's think.

Wait, perhaps the four A particles are moving in pairs, such that for each pair, their momenta are in opposite directions, but perhaps the sum is not zero. Hmm, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps each A particle is moving with the same velocity. Since the initial frame is the proton's rest frame, which has initial momentum only from the antiproton. So after annihilation, the four A particles must collectively have momentum equal to the initial momentum of the antiproton.

So, let's model this as four particles each moving with velocity v, direction either same as initial or opposite.

Wait, but four particles moving in the same direction would have a total momentum that's four times the momentum of each, which should equal the initial momentum of the antiproton. But if they're moving in opposite directions, perhaps two in one direction and two in the opposite, but that would require more careful calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the products are moving in some symmetric fashion, but the problem states that all four A particles are produced. So perhaps each A is moving with the same speed, but perhaps two are moving in the same direction and two in the opposite, but that would complicate the total momentum.

Wait, but maybe the situation is that each A⁺ and A⁻ has the same speed but opposite directions? Hmm, but that's not necessarily the case. Alternatively, perhaps all four particles are moving in the same direction, but that would require a lot of momentum.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of a simpler approach.

In the initial frame (proton's rest frame), the total initial energy is E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor for the antiproton. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, v is small, so gamma ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2c²). But wait, if v is small, then gamma is approximately 1. But since the rest mass of the products is less than the initial, the products must have significant kinetic energy, so they must be moving relativistically. So perhaps the initial antiproton isn't that slow. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem statement.

Wait, the problem says the antiproton is "slowly moving." So perhaps it's in the non-relativistic limit. So perhaps the initial energy is just E_initial = m_p c² (proton rest) + (p_p̄² c²)/(2 m_p) ), where p_p̄ is the momentum of the antiproton.

But then, in the center of mass frame, perhaps the energies and momenta are easier to handle.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the problem in the center of mass frame, where the total momentum is zero. Then, the products must have zero total momentum as well.

Wait, but in that case, each A particle's momentum would have to cancel out. So perhaps the particles are emitted symmetrically. For example, two A⁺ moving in opposite directions and two A⁻ also moving in opposite directions. But that's getting a bit complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps each A⁺ and A⁻ are moving in opposite directions with the same speed, leading to their momenta canceling each other. But with four particles, maybe two moving in one direction and two in the opposite, each with the same speed.

Wait, but let's think about the conservation of momentum. In the center of mass frame, initial momentum is zero. So the total momentum of the products must also be zero. So if the four A particles are moving in such a way that their momenta sum to zero, that would satisfy the conservation.

For example, suppose two A⁺ are moving in the +x direction and two A⁻ are moving in the -x direction, each with the same speed. Then, the momenta would be:

Each A⁺ has momentum p = gamma m_A v.

Each A⁻ has the same magnitude of momentum but in the opposite direction.

So the total momentum would be 2*(gamma m_A v) - 2*(gamma m_A v) = 0. So that works.

But then, the problem is about the velocity of the particles, so each would have the same speed magnitude, but opposite directions.

So the total momentum is zero, which matches the initial condition in the center of mass frame.

But wait, in this case, the initial frame would be the center of mass frame, which requires that the initial momentum of the system (proton and antiproton) is zero. That would happen only if the proton and antiproton are moving towards each other with equal and opposite velocities, but in the problem, it says the antiproton is moving slowly. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the initial frame is the rest frame of the proton, and the antiproton is moving towards it with some velocity. Then, the initial momentum is just that of the antiproton. So the products must have a total momentum equal to that.

But how?

In that case, after annihilation, the four A particles have a total momentum equal to the initial momentum of the antiproton (since the proton was at rest in this frame). So, the sum of their momenta should be the initial antiproton's momentum.

Assuming that in this frame, the products have some symmetric arrangement of momenta such that their sum is equal to the initial momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps each A particle is moving with the same velocity in the same direction. So four particles moving in the same direction, each with momentum gamma m_A v. Then the total momentum would be 4 gamma m_A v. This should equal the initial momentum, which is the momentum of the antiproton, p_p̄.

But wait, the antiproton's momentum is p_p̄ = gamma_p m_p v_p, where gamma_p is the Lorentz factor for the antiproton.

But perhaps if the antiproton is moving slowly, v_p is small, so gamma_p is approximately 1, and p_p̄ ≈ m_p v_p.

But in this case, the four A particles' momentum would sum to 4 gamma_A m_A v.

But perhaps the velocity v of the A particles is much higher, so we can't ignore relativistic effects for them.

This is getting a bit tangled. Maybe a better approach is to calculate the total energy and momentum before and after, then set up equations to solve for the velocity.

Let me proceed step by step.

Assume the initial frame is the rest frame of the proton. So the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with velocity v. So the initial momentum is p_initial = gamma_p m_p v, where gamma_p = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

The initial energy is E_initial = m_p c² (proton's rest) + gamma_p m_p c² (antiproton's energy).

After annihilation, we have four A particles. Let's assume each A particle has the same speed u and the same direction. So each has momentum p_A = gamma_A m_A u. So the total momentum after is 4 gamma_A m_A u = p_initial = gamma_p m_p v.

Similarly, the total energy after annihilation is 4 gamma_A m_A c². Because each A has energy gamma_A m_A c².

So, setting up the equations:

Momentum conservation:
4 gamma_A m_A u = gamma_p m_p v.   --- (1)

Energy conservation:
4 gamma_A m_A c² = m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c².   --- (2)

We can cancel m_p c² from both sides of equation (2):

4 gamma_A m_A c² = m_p c² (1 + gamma_p)
=> 4 gamma_A m_A = m_p (1 + gamma_p) / c² * c² = m_p (1 + gamma_p)
Wait, wait, let me recheck:

Equation (2):

4 gamma_A m_A c² = m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c².

Divide both sides by c²:

4 gamma_A m_A = m_p (1 + gamma_p).

So, 4 gamma_A m_A = m_p (1 + gamma_p). --- (2a)

Now, equation (1):

4 gamma_A m_A u = gamma_p m_p v.

But from equation (2a), 4 gamma_A m_A = m_p (1 + gamma_p). So substitute:

m_p (1 + gamma_p) u = gamma_p m_p v.

Cancel m_p:

(1 + gamma_p) u = gamma_p v.

So,

u = [gamma_p v (1 + gamma_p)]^{-1} ?

Wait, no:

Wait, (1 + gamma_p) u = gamma_p v.

So,

u = (gamma_p v) / (1 + gamma_p).

Hmm. Now, we have expressions for u in terms of gamma_p and v.

But we have gamma_p = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, but we have two variables here: v (the velocity of the antiproton) and u (the velocity of the A particles). But with two equations, perhaps we can relate them.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Maybe I can make some approximations.

The problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, which suggests that v is much smaller than c. So gamma_p ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2 c²), but since v << c, gamma_p is approximately 1.

So, let's approximate gamma_p ≈ 1.

Then,

From equation (2a):

4 gamma_A m_A = m_p (1 + 1) = 2 m_p.

So,

gamma_A = (2 m_p )/(4 m_A ) ) = m_p/(2 m_A).

Wait, m_p is about 938 MeV/c², and m_A is 300 MeV/c².

So,

m_p/(2 m_A) = (938)/(2 * 300) ≈ 938 / 600 ≈ 1.563.

So,

gamma_A ≈ 1.563.

But gamma is always greater than or equal to 1, which this satisfies.

Now, gamma_A = 1.563.

So we can find the velocity u of the A particles.

We know that gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (u²/c²)).

So,

1.563 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (u^2/c^2)).

Rearranging,

sqrt(1 - (u²/c²)) = 1/1.563 ≈ 0.64.

So,

1 - (u²/c²) = (0.64)^2 ≈ 0.4096.

So,

u²/c² ≈ 1 - 0.4096 = 0.5904.

So,

u = c * sqrt(0.5904) ≈ c * 0.768.

So, approximately 0.768c.

Looking at the options, option C is 0.91c, D is 0.86c. Hmm, 0.768 is not exactly any of the options. The closest would be option A, 0.77c. But wait, I made an approximation that gamma_p ≈ 1, which might not be accurate.

Wait, because if gamma_p is about 1.563, then gamma_p = 1.563, which would mean that v is not that small.

Wait, wait, wait. Let's think again. Because in the initial approximation, I assumed that the antiproton is moving slowly (v << c) so gamma_p ≈ 1. But if the velocity u comes out to be about 0.77c, then gamma_A is about 1.563, which is acceptable.

But wait, I think I might have confused gamma_p and gamma_A. Let me re-express this.

Wait, when I approximated gamma_p as 1, I considered that the antiproton is moving slowly, but perhaps that's not the case because the products have a significant gamma.

Wait, perhaps the initial approximation was incorrect because even though the antiproton is moving slowly, the products have to move relativistically, so the energy from the initial particles is higher than their rest mass.

Wait, maybe it's better to not make the approximation and instead solve the equations without it.

Let me attempt that.

We have:

Equation (1):

4 gamma_A m_A u = gamma_p m_p v.

Equation (2a):

4 gamma_A m_A = m_p (1 + gamma_p).

Let me solve equation (2a) for m_p (1 + gamma_p):

m_p (1 + gamma_p) = 4 gamma_A m_A.

So,

(1 + gamma_p) = (4 gamma_A m_A)/ m_p. --- (2b)

Now, substitute (2b) into equation (1):

4 gamma_A m_A u = gamma_p m_p v.

But from (2b), 1 + gamma_p = (4 gamma_A m_A ) / m_p.

So, gamma_p = (4 gamma_A m_A ) / m_p - 1.

Substituting into equation (1):

4 gamma_A m_A u = [ (4 gamma_A m_A / m_p ) - 1 ] * m_p v.

Simplify the right side:

(4 gamma_A m_A / m_p - 1 ) * m_p v = [4 gamma_A m_A - m_p ] v.

So,

4 gamma_A m_A u = (4 gamma_A m_A - m_p ) v.

So,

u = [ (4 gamma_A m_A - m_p ) v ] / (4 gamma_A m_A )

Hmm, this seems complicated, but perhaps I can express v in terms of u, or find a relation between them.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express v in terms of u using the expressions for gamma_p.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I can find another approach.

Alternatively, let's think about the energies.

In the initial frame (proton's rest frame), the initial energy is:

E_initial = m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c².

The final energy is:

E_final = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

So,

E_initial = E_final.

So,

m_p c² (1 + gamma_p) = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

Cancel c²:

m_p (1 + gamma_p) = 4 gamma_A m_A.

Which is the same as equation (2a).

Hmm, but I'm not getting anywhere with this approach. Maybe I can relate gamma_p and gamma_A through the velocities.

Wait, perhaps I can express gamma_p in terms of u.

From equation (1):

gamma_p = [4 gamma_A m_A u ] / (m_p v).

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the velocity u using the relation between gamma_A and the rest masses.

Wait, another approach: in the center of mass frame, the total momentum is zero. So the products must have zero momentum, which implies that they are emitted symmetrically. As I thought earlier, two A⁺ moving in one direction and two A⁻ in the opposite direction, but perhaps their velocities are the same magnitude but opposite direction.

Wait, but in that case, the total momentum would be zero, which would require that the initial momentum is zero. But that's only possible if the proton and antiproton are moving in opposite directions with equal and opposite velocities in the initial frame. But the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, implying that perhaps the proton is at rest.

This is getting too confusing. Maybe I should try using the invariant quantity, the Mandelstam variable s, which is the square of the total energy in the center of mass frame.

Wait, the Mandelstam variable s is given by s = (E_total)^2 - (p_total c)^2.

In the initial frame, the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with momentum p. So,

E_total_initial = m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c².

p_total_initial = gamma_p m_p v.

So,

s = [m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c²]^2 - (gamma_p m_p v c )^2.

Simplify:

s = [m_p c² (1 + gamma_p)]^2 - (gamma_p m_p v c )^2.

But in the center of mass frame, s is also equal to (sum of rest energies)^2. Because in the center of mass frame, the total momentum is zero, so the invariant s is (sum of rest energies)^2 c^4.

So,

s = (sum E_rest)^2 = (2 m_p c²)^2 ? Wait, no: wait, in the initial state, the particles are a proton and antiproton, each with rest energy m_p c². So sum E_rest_initial = 2 m_p c².

Wait, but wait, no. The sum of rest energies of the initial particles is 2 m_p c². The sum of rest energies of the final particles is 4 m_A c² = 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV, which is less than 2*938=1876 MeV. So the initial rest energy is higher.

But the invariant s is the same in all frames.

So,

s = [sum E_initial]^2 - (sum p_initial c )^2.

sum E_initial = m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c².

sum p_initial = gamma_p m_p v.

So,

s = [m_p c² (1 + gamma_p)]^2 - [gamma_p m_p v c]^2.

And,

s = (sum E_rest_initial )^2 = (2 m_p c²)^2.

Wait, no, sum E_rest_initial is 2 m_p c², so s = (2 m_p c²)^2.

So,

[m_p c² (1 + gamma_p)]^2 - [gamma_p m_p v c]^2 = (2 m_p c²)^2.

Divide both sides by (m_p c²)^2:

(1 + gamma_p)^2 - (gamma_p v^2 c² ) / (m_p c²)^2 * (m_p c^2)^2 ?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to write:

Let me compute s as [E_initial]^2 - (p_initial c)^2.

E_initial = m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c² = m_p c² (1 + gamma_p).

p_initial = gamma_p m_p v.

So,

s = [m_p c² (1 + gamma_p)]^2 - (gamma_p m_p v c )^2.

But s must equal (sum E_rest_final )^2 = (4 m_A c² )^2.

So,

[m_p c² (1 + gamma_p)]^2 - [gamma_p m_p v c]^2 = (4 m_A c² )^2.

Divide both sides by c^4 to make it dimensionless:

[m_p² (1 + gamma_p)^2 ] - [gamma_p^2 m_p^2 v² ] = (4 m_A )^2.

Simplify:

m_p² [ (1 + gamma_p)^2 - gamma_p^2 (v² / c²) ] = 16 m_A².

Hmm, this looks complicated, but perhaps we can find a relation between v and gamma_p.

We know that v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma_p²).

Wait, because gamma_p = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) → 1 - v²/c² = 1/gamma_p² → v²/c² = 1 - 1/gamma_p².

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/gamma_p².

Substituting into the equation:

m_p² [ (1 + gamma_p)^2 - gamma_p^2 (1 - 1/gamma_p^2 ) ] = 16 m_A^2.

Simplify the term inside the brackets:

(1 + gamma_p)^2 - gamma_p^2 (1 - 1/gamma_p^2 ) 

= [1 + 2 gamma_p + gamma_p^2 ] - [gamma_p^2 - 1 ]

= 1 + 2 gamma_p + gamma_p^2 - gamma_p^2 + 1

= 2 + 2 gamma_p.

So,

m_p^2 (2 + 2 gamma_p ) = 16 m_A^2.

Factor out 2:

2 m_p^2 (1 + gamma_p ) = 16 m_A^2.

Divide both sides by 2:

m_p^2 (1 + gamma_p ) = 8 m_A^2.

So,

1 + gamma_p = (8 m_A^2 ) / (m_p^2 ).

Substituting m_p = 938 MeV, m_A = 300 MeV.

m_p = 938 MeV/c².

m_A = 300 MeV/c².

So,

1 + gamma_p = (8 * (300)^2 ) / (938)^2.

Calculate numerator: 8 * 90000 = 720000.

Denominator: 938^2 ≈ 879,844.

So,

(720000) / (879844) ≈ 0.818.

So,

1 + gamma_p ≈ 0.818 → gamma_p ≈ -0.182.

Wait, that can't be right. Gamma_p is always greater than or equal to 1, since it's the Lorentz factor. So getting a negative value here suggests I made a mistake in the calculation.

Ah, I see the mistake. Let me check the calculation again.

m_p² * (1 + gamma_p) = 8 m_A^2.

Wait, no, earlier equation after substitution:

m_p^2 (1 + gamma_p ) = 8 m_A^2.

Wait, but when I plug in the numbers,

( (938 MeV/c²)^2 ) * (1 + gamma_p) ) = 8 * (300 MeV/c² )^2.

So,

1 + gamma_p = [8 * 90000 (MeV²/c^4 ) ] / [ (938)^2 (MeV²/c^4 ) ) ].

So,

1 + gamma_p = (8 * 90000) / (938^2).

Calculate numerator: 8 * 90000 = 720,000.

Denominator: 938^2 = 938 * 938.

Compute 900^2 = 810,000. 38^2=1444. The cross term is 2*900*38 = 68,400.

So 938^2 = (900 +38)^2 = 900² + 2*900*38 + 38² = 810,000 + 68,400 + 1,444 = 879,844.

So,

1 + gamma_p = 720000 / 879844 ≈ 0.818.

So,

gamma_p ≈ 0.818 - 1 = -0.182.

That's impossible. Gamma_p can't be negative. So I must have messed up the algebra somewhere.

Wait, let me retrace.

Starting from s = (2 m_p c² )^2.

s = [E_initial]^2 - (p_initial c )^2.

E_initial = m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c².

p_initial = gamma_p m_p v.

So,

s = (m_p c² (1 + gamma_p ))^2 - (gamma_p m_p v c )^2.

Then,

s = (2 m_p c² )^2.

So,

(m_p c² (1 + gamma_p ))^2 - (gamma_p m_p v c )^2 = (2 m_p c² )^2.

Divide both sides by (m_p c² )^2:

(1 + gamma_p )^2 - (gamma_p^2 v² c² )/(m_p c^2 )^2 * (m_p c^2 )^2 ?

Wait, no, perhaps better to write everything in terms of (v/c) and gamma_p.

Let me write:

(1 + gamma_p )^2 - (gamma_p^2 v^2 ) = 4.

Because,

(m_p c² (1 + gamma_p ))^2 = (2 m_p c² )^2 → (1 + gamma_p )^2 = 4.

Wait, that can't be right because (m_p c² (1 + gamma_p ))^2 is (2 m_p c² )^2 only if (1 + gamma_p )^2 = 4 → 1 + gamma_p = 2 → gamma_p = 1.

Which would imply that the antiproton is at rest, which can't be the case because it's moving.

Wait, I'm getting something wrong here. Let me think again.

Wait, the invariant s is given by s = (E_total)^2 - (p_total c )^2.

In the initial frame (proton's rest frame), E_total is m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c².

p_total is gamma_p m_p v.

So,

s = (m_p c² (1 + gamma_p ))^2 - (gamma_p m_p v c )^2.

But s is also equal to the square of the total energy in the center of mass frame, which is the sum of the rest energies of the products.

So,

s = (sum E_rest )^2 = (4 m_A c² )^2.

So,

(m_p c² (1 + gamma_p ))^2 - (gamma_p m_p v c )^2 = (4 m_A c² )^2.

Divide both sides by c^4 to simplify units:

(m_p^2 (1 + gamma_p )^2 ) - (gamma_p^2 m_p^2 v² ) = 16 m_A^2.

Now, let's factor m_p^2 on the left:

m_p^2 [ (1 + gamma_p )^2 - gamma_p^2 (v² / c² ) ] = 16 m_A^2.

But gamma_p is defined as 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² ), so:

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(gamma_p^2 )

Substituting,

m_p^2 [ (1 + gamma_p )^2 - gamma_p^2 (1 - 1/gamma_p^2 ) ] = 16 m_A^2.

Simplify the term inside the brackets:

(1 + gamma_p )^2 - gamma_p^2 (1 - 1/gamma_p^2 )

= [1 + 2 gamma_p + gamma_p^2 ] - [gamma_p^2 - 1 ]

= 1 + 2 gamma_p + gamma_p^2 - gamma_p^2 + 1

= 2 + 2 gamma_p.

So,

m_p^2 (2 + 2 gamma_p ) = 16 m_A^2.

Factor out 2:

2 m_p^2 (1 + gamma_p ) = 16 m_A^2.

Divide both sides by 2:

m_p^2 (1 + gamma_p ) = 8 m_A^2.

So,

1 + gamma_p = (8 m_A^2 ) / (m_p^2 )

Substituting the values:

m_p = 938 MeV/c² → m_p^2 = (938)^2 ≈ 879,844 (MeV/c²)^2.

m_A = 300 → m_A^2 = 90,000.

So,

8 m_A^2 = 8 * 90,000 = 720,000.

Thus,

1 + gamma_p = 720,000 / 879,844 ≈ 0.818.

So,

gamma_p ≈ 0.818 - 1 = -0.182.

Which is impossible because gamma_p can't be negative. So I must have made a mistake in the setup.

This suggests that the assumption that the initial frame is the proton's rest frame and the antiproton is moving with velocity v is leading to a contradiction, which implies that perhaps the initial assumption is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the initial frame is the center of mass frame. So the initial momentum is zero, and the products have zero momentum. So in that case, each A particle must have equal and opposite momenta.

But then, the velocities would be such that their momenta cancel.

But in that case, the velocity of each A particle would be determined by the energy.

The total energy after annihilation is sum of rest energies plus kinetic energies.

But the initial energy in the center of mass frame is 2 m_p c².

Wait, no. In the center of mass frame, the initial energy is the sum of the energies of the proton and antiproton, which are each moving towards each other with some velocity. But if the system is in the center of mass frame, the total momentum is zero.

Wait, perhaps the initial total energy is 2 m_p c², assuming they are at rest. But that can't be, because they're moving towards each other.

No, I think the initial energy in the center of mass frame is higher than 2 m_p c² because the particles are moving.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Let me think about the kinetic energy released. The initial rest mass is 2 m_p c² = 1876 MeV. The final rest mass is 4 m_A c² = 1200 MeV. So the kinetic energy available is 1876 - 1200 = 676 MeV.

But this is distributed among the four A particles. So each would have an average kinetic energy of 676 /4 ≈ 169 MeV.

The rest energy of each A is 300 MeV, so the total energy of each A is 300 + 169 = 469 MeV.

So, the Lorentz factor gamma for each A is 469 / 300 ≈ 1.563.

So, gamma ≈ 1.563.

Then, using gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c² ), we can find v.

So,

1.563 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c² )

→ sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) = 1/1.563 ≈ 0.64.

→ 1 - v²/c² = 0.4096.

→ v²/c² = 1 - 0.4096 = 0.5904.

→ v = c * sqrt(0.5904 ) ≈ c * 0.768.

So, approximately 0.768 c. Which is about 0.77c, option A.

But wait, this approach ignores the fact that the initial state may have some kinetic energy. Because the initial particles are moving, their energy isn't just their rest mass.

Wait, but in the center of mass frame, the initial energy is higher than 2 m_p c². Because the particles are moving towards each other, their energies add up.

Hmm, perhaps this approach is incorrect. But given the time I've spent, maybe I should proceed with the answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the annihilation process \( p + \bar{p} \rightarrow 2A^+ + 2A^- \) under the given conditions. The rest energy of each \( A \)-particle is \( m_A c^2 = 300 \, \text{MeV} \), and the antiproton is moving slowly. The goal is to determine the velocity of the \( A \)-particles.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial Energy and Momentum**:
   - The proton and antiproton each have a rest mass energy of \( m_p c^2 = 938 \, \text{MeV} \).
   - The total initial rest energy is \( 2 m_p c^2 = 1876 \, \text{MeV} \).
   - The final rest energy of the four \( A \)-particles is \( 4 m_A c^2 = 1200 \, \text{MeV} \).
   - The difference in energy (\( 1876 - 1200 = 676 \, \text{MeV} \)) is converted into the kinetic energy of the \( A \)-particles.

2. **Energy of Each \( A \)-particle**:
   - Each \( A \)-particle has a rest energy of \( 300 \, \text{MeV} \).
   - The total energy of each \( A \)-particle is the sum of its rest energy and kinetic energy. Assuming equal energy distribution, each \( A \)-particle has a total energy of:
     \[
     E_A = 300 + \frac{676}{4} = 469 \, \text{MeV}.
     \]

3. **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**:
   - The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) for each \( A \)-particle is:
     \[
     \gamma = \frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \frac{469}{300} \approx 1.563.
     \]
   - Using the relativistic relation \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we solve for the velocity \( v \):
     \[
     \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{\gamma} \implies 1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{\gamma^2}.
     \]
     Substituting \( \gamma = 1.563 \):
     \[
     1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{(1.563)^2} \approx 0.4096 \implies v^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.4096 = 0.5904.
     \]
     \[
     v = c \sqrt{0.5904} \approx 0.768c.
     \]

4. **Comparison with Options**:
   - The calculated velocity \( v \approx 0.768c \) is closest to option **A) 0.77c**.

### Conclusion:
The velocity of each \( A \)-particle is approximately \( 0.77c \).
