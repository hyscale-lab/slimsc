Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and its magnetic moment. Hmm, I remember that spin-1/2 particles, like electrons, have their own magnetic moments. The problem says the magnetic moment mu is equal to gamma times Sz. Oh right, gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, and Sz is the spin component along the magnetic field direction.

So initially, the magnetic field is pointing in the +Z direction. The particle's magnetic moment is aligned with this field, so I guess that means it's in an eigenstate of Sz, either spin-up or spin-down. Being aligned, it's probably in the spin-up state because the magnetic moment would align with the field direction.

Then, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. Wait, when the field is turned off, does that mean the Hamiltonian changes? Because the magnetic field affects the Hamiltonian through the Zeeman term. So the initial Hamiltonian was proportional to Sz, and then it's changed to proportional to Sy.

The question is about the average of the z-component of the particle’s moment oscillating. So we're looking at the expectation value of Sz over time, and it's oscillating. What causes oscillations in expectation values? I think it's when the system is in a superposition of energy eigenstates, leading to interference terms that vary with time.

Wait, so initially, when the field was along Z, the particle is in an eigenstate of Sz. Let me think about the Hamiltonian. The initial Hamiltonian is H1 = -gamma B Sz. Oh wait, actually, I think the energy is given by the Zeeman interaction, which is something like mu·B. So mu is gamma Sz, and B is along Z, so the energy is gamma B Sz. But the sign might not matter for this problem.

When the field is switched to Y, the new Hamiltonian is H2 = gamma B Sy. So the system's Hamiltonian suddenly changes from H1 to H2. Wait, when the field is turned off and another turned on, the change is instantaneous. So the state of the system doesn't change instantly; it's still the same as before, but the Hamiltonian governing its evolution does.

So the initial state is an eigenstate of Sz. Let's denote the spin-up state as |↑⟩_z. But under the new Hamiltonian H2 = gamma B Sy, this state is no longer an eigenstate. So the system will evolve over time, and the expectation values may oscillate.

What's the expectation value of Sz in this new scenario? Let's model this.

The initial state is |↑⟩_z. I can express this state in terms of the eigenstates of H2. The eigenstates of Sy are |+⟩_y and |−⟩_y. Let me recall the eigenstates of Sy. The spin matrices for Sx and Sy are different, but I think the eigenstates for Sy are (|↑⟩_z + i|↓⟩_z)/√2 and (|↑⟩_z - i|↓⟩_z)/√2, or something like that.

Wait, the eigenstates of Sy can be written as |+y⟩ = (|↑⟩ + i|↓⟩)/√2 and |−y⟩ = (|↑⟩ − i|↓⟩)/√2. So the initial state |↑⟩_z is a combination of these.

Let me compute the expansion of |↑⟩_z in terms of |+y⟩ and |−y⟩. Let's write:

|↑⟩_z = a |+y⟩ + b |−y⟩.

Plugging in the expressions for |+y⟩ and |−y⟩:

|↑⟩_z = a (|↑⟩ + i|↓⟩)/√2 + b (|↑⟩ − i|↓⟩)/√2.

Grouping terms:

= [ (a + b)/√2 ] |↑⟩ + [i a - i b)/√2 ] |↓⟩.

But |↑⟩_z is just |↑⟩, so the coefficients for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ must match.

So, [ (a + b)/√2 ] = 1,
and [ i (a - b) ) / √2 ] = 0.

From the second equation: i (a - b) = 0 → a = b.

Plugging into the first equation: (a + a)/√2 = 1 → 2a/√2 = 1 → a = √2/2.

So a = b = 1/√2.

So, |↑⟩_z = (|+y⟩ + |−y⟩)/√2.

Wait, because a and b are both 1/√2.

Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake in the expansion. Let me double-check.

Wait, the eigenstates are |+y⟩ = (|↑⟩ + i|↓⟩)/√2 and |−y⟩ = (|↑⟩ - i|↓⟩)/√2.

So when I expand |↑⟩ in terms of |+y⟩ and |−y⟩, I get:

|↑⟩ = [ (|+y⟩ + |−y⟩) ] / √2.

Wait, let's compute the coefficients. Let me express |↑⟩ in terms of |+y⟩ and |−y⟩.

|↑⟩ = (|+y⟩ + |−y⟩) / √2.

Because:

|+y⟩ + |−y⟩ = [ (|↑⟩ + i|↓⟩) + (|↑⟩ - i|↓⟩) ] /√2 → [2|↑⟩] / √2 → √2 |↑⟩.

So |↑⟩ = (|+y⟩ + |−y⟩)/√2.

So in the new basis, the initial state is a superposition of |+y⟩ and |−y⟩, each with coefficients 1/√2.

Now, the new Hamiltonian H2 is proportional to Sy, so its eigenstates are |+y⟩ and |−y⟩, with energies E+ and E-.

Wait, let me compute the energy eigenvalues. The Hamiltonian is H2 = gamma B Sy. The eigenvalues of Sy are ħ/2 * (1 and -1) in units where ħ is 1, perhaps. Wait, for spin-1/2, Sx, Sy, Sz each have eigenvalues ± ħ/2. But in the particle's magnetic moment, mu is gamma S, so perhaps in terms of the Hamiltonian, each component would contribute to the energy as gamma B S_z, etc.

Wait, the Hamiltonian for the magnetic moment in a magnetic field is usually H = -mu · B. But in this problem, mu is given as gamma S, so H = -gamma B (S · n), where n is the direction of B. Wait the problem says mu = gamma S_z, but perhaps that's when B is along z. Oh wait, the problem says mu = gamma S_z, but when the field is along Y, the magnetic moment would be gamma S_y? Or wait no, mu is the magnetic moment which is gamma S_z when the field is along Z. But when the field is along Y, the magnetic moment would interact with the field via Sy. Hmm, perhaps the Hamiltonian after the field is turned on along Y is H2 = gamma B S_y.

Wait, let's think. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, but when the field is along a different direction, the interaction is mu · B. So if the field is along Y, the interaction is gamma (S · B) = gamma B S_y.

So H2 = gamma B S_y.

The eigenstates of S_y are |+y⟩ and |−y⟩, with eigenvalues ± ħ/2. But in the problem, perhaps we're using units where ħ=1, or perhaps it's already accounted for in gamma. Not sure, but probably, for our purposes, the energies are plus and minus (gamma B / 2).

Wait, let me clarify. The energy eigenvalues for H2 are E = gamma B (± ħ/2) ? Or perhaps the spin matrices are being used without the ħ factor. Wait, in quantum mechanics, the spin matrices have eigenvalues ± ħ/2, but perhaps in the problem, gamma already includes any necessary constants, or perhaps we're using units where ħ=1.

But perhaps for our purposes, the energy levels are E_+ = gamma B (1/2) and E_- = - gamma B (1/2). Wait, no, because the eigenvalues of S_y are ± ħ/2, but in the problem statement, mu is given as gamma S_z, so perhaps the Hamiltonian is H = -mu · B. Wait, but the initial magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z, but when the field is in Y direction, mu would be gamma S_y? Or perhaps mu is fixed as gamma S_z, but the field is along Y, so the interaction is gamma S_z * B_y? Hmm, I might be getting confused here.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the Hamiltonian as H = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, because mu is gamma S, but when the field is along Y, the interaction is mu · B = gamma S · B. So if B is along Y, then H = -gamma B S_y. Wait, but in the first part, when the field was along Z, H was -gamma B S_z.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem defines mu as gamma S, so when the field is along Y, the Hamiltonian is H = -mu · B = -gamma B S_y, but the sign may not matter because we're concerned with the energy differences.

But perhaps in the problem, the actual value of the energy is not as important as the energy difference between the eigenstates. Because for oscillations, the frequency is determined by the energy difference over h-bar.

Wait, but in any case, let's proceed. The initial state after the field change is |↑⟩_z, which we've written as (|+y⟩ + |−y⟩)/√2.

The time evolution under H2 is given by each component evolving with its phase. So each component |+y⟩ and |−y⟩ will contribute a phase factor of e^(-i E t / ħ).

But let's compute the expectation value of Sz at time t.

The initial state is |psi(0)⟩ = (|+y⟩ + |−y⟩)/√2.

After time t, the state is |psi(t)⟩ = (e^{-i E_+ t / ħ} |+y⟩ + e^{-i E_- t / ħ} |−y⟩)/√2.

Now, we want to find the expectation value of Sz: ⟨Sz⟩ = ⟨psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)⟩.

Let me remember that S_z has eigenstates |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. The |+y⟩ and |−y⟩ states can be written in terms of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express S_z in the |+y⟩, |−y⟩ basis.

Wait, let me compute the matrix elements of S_z in the |+y⟩, |−y⟩ basis.

The |+y⟩ state is (|↑⟩ + i |↓⟩)/√2, and |−y⟩ is (|↑⟩ - i |↓⟩)/√2.

So, S_z |+y⟩ = (S_z |↑⟩ + i S_z |↓⟩ ) /√2 = ( (ħ/2) |↑⟩ + i (-ħ/2) |↓⟩ ) /√2.

Which is (ħ/2) [ |↑⟩ - i |↓⟩ ] /√2.

Hmm, but perhaps this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the expectation value using the expansion of the states.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value of S_z in the state |psi(t)⟩.

So let's write |psi(t)⟩ = (e^{-i E_+ t/ħ} |+y⟩ + e^{-i E_- t/ħ} |−y⟩ ) /√2.

To find ⟨Sz⟩, we can compute ⟨psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)⟩.

But S_z acts on |+y⟩ and |−y⟩ in some way. Alternatively, perhaps express S_z in the |+y⟩ and |−y⟩ basis.

Wait, perhaps the matrix elements for S_z in the |+y⟩ basis can be found.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that S_z and S_y don't commute, so when the state is expressed in the |+y⟩ and |−y⟩ basis, S_z has off-diagonal elements.

Alternatively, perhaps a smarter approach is to note that the time evolution will cause the state to precess, leading to oscillations in the expectation values.

Wait, but maybe a better approach is to calculate the energy levels and then find the transition frequency.

The energy eigenvalues for H2 are E_+ = (gamma B) (ħ/2) and E_- = - (gamma B) (ħ/2). Wait, but wait, the spin matrices have eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So if H2 is gamma B Sy, then E_+ = gamma B (ħ/2), and E_- = -gamma B (ħ/2).

But perhaps I should be careful with signs. Let me think again. The Hamiltonian is H2 = gamma B Sy.

Sy has eigenvalues ± (ħ/2). So E_+ = gamma B (ħ/2), and E_- = gamma B (- ħ/2).

The energy difference between E_+ and E_- is gamma B (ħ/2) - ( - gamma B (ħ/2) ) ) = gamma B ħ.

But wait, the time evolution will cause the phases to differ by the energy difference multiplied by time.

So the system is in a superposition of these two energy eigenstates. The time-dependent phase difference between the two components will lead to oscillations in expectation values.

The initial state is |psi(0)⟩ = (|+y⟩ + |−y⟩)/√2.

So the state at time t is |psi(t)⟩ = (e^{-i E_+ t/ħ} |+y⟩ + e^{-i E_- t/ħ} |−y⟩ ) /√2.

The expectation value of Sz is ⟨psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)⟩.

Let me compute this:

⟨psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)⟩ = [ (⟨+y| e^{i E_+ t/ħ} + ⟨−y| e^{i E_- t/ħ} ) /√2 ] * S_z [ (|+y⟩ e^{-i E_+ t/ħ} + |−y⟩ e^{-i E_- t/ħ} ) /√2 ].

Expanding this, we get:

(1/2) [ ⟨+y| e^{i E_+ t} S_z |+y⟩ e^{-i E_+ t} + ⟨+y| e^{i E_+ t} S_z |−y⟩ e^{-i E_- t} + ⟨−y| e^{i E_- t} S_z |+y⟩ e^{-i E_+ t} + ⟨−y| e^{i E_- t} S_z |−y⟩ e^{-i E_- t} ].

Simplify each term:

The first term is ⟨+y| S_z |+y⟩.

The second term is e^{i (E_+ - E_-) t} ⟨+y| S_z |−y⟩.

The third term is e^{i (E_- - E_+) t} ⟨−y| S_z |+y⟩.

The fourth term is ⟨−y| S_z |−y⟩.

Now, let's compute these matrix elements.

First, what is ⟨+y| S_z |+y⟩?

|+y⟩ = (|↑⟩ + i |↓⟩)/√2.

So S_z |+y⟩ = (S_z |↑⟩ + i S_z |↓⟩ ) /√2 = ( (ħ/2) |↑⟩ + i (- ħ/2) |↓⟩ ) /√2.

Taking the inner product with ⟨+y|:

⟨+y| S_z |+y⟩ = (⟨↑| + i ⟨↓| ) ( (ħ/2) |↑⟩ - i (ħ/2)|↓⟩ ) ) / 2.

Wait, because ⟨+y| is (⟨↑| - i ⟨↓| ) / √2 ? Wait no, earlier we wrote |+y⟩ as (|↑⟩ + i |↓⟩)/√2, so ⟨+y| should be (⟨↑| - i ⟨↓| ) /√2.

So,

⟨+y| S_z |+y⟩ = [ (⟨↑| - i ⟨↓| ) /√2 ] * [ (ħ/2 |↑⟩ - i ħ/2 |↓⟩ ) /√2 ].

Multiplying them:

= [ (⟨↑| (ħ/2 |↑⟩ ) ) + (⟨↑| (-i ħ/2 |↓⟩ )) ) + (-i ⟨↓| (ħ/2 |↑⟩ ) ) + ( (-i)(-i) ⟨↓| (ħ/2 |↓⟩ )) ) ] / 2.

Each term:

⟨↑| (ħ/2 |↑⟩ ) = ħ/2.

⟨↑| (-i ħ/2 |↓⟩ ) = 0.

(-i) ⟨↓| (ħ/2 |↑⟩ ) = 0.

⟨↓| (i^2) (ħ/2 |↓⟩ ) → wait, (-i)(-i) is (i^2)= (-1), so that term is (-1) (ħ/2) ⟨↓| ↓ ⟩ = (-1)(ħ/2).

So adding up:

(ħ/2 + 0 + 0 - ħ/2 ) / 2 = 0.

So ⟨+y| S_z |+y⟩ = 0.

Similarly, ⟨−y| S_z |−y⟩ can be computed. Let's see.

|−y⟩ = (|↑⟩ - i |↓⟩)/√2.

S_z |−y⟩ = (S_z |↑⟩ - i S_z |↓⟩ ) /√2 = ( (ħ/2)|↑⟩ - i ( - ħ/2 ) |↓⟩ ) /√2 = ( ħ/2 |↑⟩ + i (ħ/2) |↓⟩ ) /√2.

⟨−y| S_z |−y⟩ = (⟨↑| + i ⟨↓| ) /√2 * [ (ħ/2 |↑⟩ + i (ħ/2) |↓⟩ ) ] /√2.

Expanding:

⟨↑| (ħ/2 |↑⟩ ) = ħ/2.

⟨↑| (i ħ/2 |↓⟩ ) = 0.

i ⟨↓| (ħ/2 |↑⟩ ) = 0.

i ⟨↓| (i ħ/2 |↓⟩ ) = i^2 (ħ/2) ⟨↓| ↓⟩ = (-1)(ħ/2).

Adding:

( ħ/2 - ħ/2 ) / 2 = 0.

So ⟨−y| S_z |−y⟩ = 0.

So the first and fourth terms in the expectation value expression are zero.

Now, the cross terms: the second and third terms.

Term 2: e^{i (E_+ - E_-) t} ⟨+y| S_z |−y⟩.

Term 3: e^{i (E_- - E_+ ) t} ⟨−y| S_z |+y⟩.

Note that ⟨−y| S_z |+y⟩ is the complex conjugate of ⟨+y| S_z |−y⟩, because S_z is Hermitian.

So let me compute ⟨+y| S_z |−y⟩.

Again, express |±y⟩ in terms of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩.

⟨+y| S_z |−y⟩ = (⟨↑| - i ⟨↓| ) /√2 * S_z * (|↑⟩ - i |↓⟩ ) /√2.

Compute S_z (|↑⟩ - i |↓⟩ ) = (ħ/2 |↑⟩ ) - i ( - ħ/2 |↓⟩ ) = ħ/2 |↑⟩ + i ħ/2 |↓⟩.

So,

⟨+y| S_z |−y⟩ = (⟨↑| - i ⟨↓| ) [ (ħ/2 |↑⟩ + i ħ/2 |↓⟩ ) ] / 2.

Multiplying out:

⟨↑| (ħ/2 |↑⟩ ) = ħ/2.

⟨↑| (i ħ/2 |↓⟩ ) = 0.

(-i ⟨↓| (ħ/2 |↑⟩ ) = (-i) (0) ) = 0.

(-i ⟨↓| (i ħ/2 |↓⟩ ) ) = (-i)(i) (ħ/2) ⟨↓| ↓⟩ = (1)(ħ/2).

So total: (ħ/2 + ħ/2 ) / 2 = ( ħ ) / 2.

Wait, no. Let me redo this calculation.

Wait, let me compute each part:

⟨↑| multiplied by (ħ/2 |↑⟩ ) gives ħ/2.

⟨↑| multiplied by (i ħ/2 |↓⟩ ) gives 0.

(-i ⟨↓| ) multiplied by (ħ/2 |↑⟩ ) gives (-i)(0) → 0.

(-i ⟨↓| ) multiplied by (i ħ/2 |↓⟩ ) gives (-i)(i) (ħ/2) ) = (-i^2) (ħ/2) = (1)(ħ/2).

So adding these contributions: ħ/2 + ħ/2 = ħ.

Then, divide by 2 (from the denominator of each state), so:

⟨+y| S_z |−y⟩ = ħ / 2.

Wait, no, the denominator is √2 * √2 = 2, so all the terms above (which sum to ħ) are divided by 2. So the total is ħ/2.

Wait, no, wait, perhaps I missed a step. Let me think again.

Wait, the calculation was:

(⟨↑| - i ⟨↓| ) (ħ/2 |↑⟩ + i ħ/2 |↓⟩ ) / (2).

Expanding:

= [ ⟨↑| (ħ/2 |↑⟩ ) + ⟨↑| (i ħ/2 |↓⟩ ) - i ⟨↓| ( ħ/2 |↑⟩ ) - i ⟨↓| (i ħ/2 |↓⟩ ) ] / 2.

Each term:

⟨↑| (ħ/2 |↑⟩ ) → (ħ/2)(1) = ħ/2.

⟨↑| (i ħ/2 |↓⟩ ) → 0.

- i ⟨↓| ( ħ/2 |↑⟩ ) → 0.

- i ⟨↓| (i ħ/2 |↓⟩ ) → (-i)(i) (ħ/2)(1) )= (1)(ħ/2).

So sum of terms is (ħ/2 + ħ/2) = ħ, then divided by 2 → ħ/2.

So ⟨+y| S_z |−y⟩ = ħ/2.

Similarly, ⟨−y| S_z |+y⟩ is the complex conjugate, which would be ħ/2. Because S_z is Hermitian, so ⟨−y| S_z |+y⟩ = (⟨+y| S_z |−y⟩ )* → (ħ/2)* = ħ/2 (since it's real).

So the cross terms are:

Term2: e^{i (E_+ - E_- ) t} * (ħ/2) 
Term3: e^{i (E_- - E_+ ) t} * (ħ/2) = e^{-i (E_+ - E_- ) t} * (ħ/2 )

So the sum of Term2 and Term3 is:

(ħ/2) [ e^{i Δ E t} + e^{-i Δ E t} ] 

where Δ E = (E_+ - E_- ) = (gamma B (ħ/2) ) - ( - gamma B (ħ/2) ) ) = gamma B ħ.

Wait, E_+ = (gamma B) (ħ/2 ), E_- = - (gamma B) (ħ/2 ).

So E_+ - E_- = gamma B ħ.

So,

Term2 + Term3 = (ħ/2) [ e^{i (gamma B ħ) t} + e^{-i (gamma B ħ) t} ] 
= (ħ/2) * 2 cos( gamma B ħ t )
= ħ cos( gamma B ħ t )

So putting it all together, the expectation value ⟨Sz⟩ is:

⟨Sz⟩ = 0 + (ħ/2) [ e^{i gamma B ħ t} + e^{-i gamma B ħ t} ] * (1/2) ?

Wait, no, earlier the expansion after expanding all terms gave the cross terms. Let me re-examine.

Wait, in the expectation value calculation, the only terms that contribute are the cross terms, which are Term2 and Term3. The entire expression for ⟨Sz⟩ is:

⟨Sz⟩ = (1/2) [ Term2 + Term3 ]

= (1/2) * (ħ/2) [ e^{i Δ E t} + e^{-i Δ E t} ]

= (ħ/4) [ 2 cos(Δ E t) ]

= (ħ/2) cos(Δ E t )

So,

⟨Sz⟩ = (ħ/2) cos( (gamma B ħ ) t )

Wait, but the problem states that the oscillation frequency is for the average of the z-component of the moment, which is gamma times the expectation value of S_z, because mu_z = gamma S_z.

So the average mu_z is gamma * ⟨S_z⟩.

So,

⟨mu_z⟩ = gamma * ⟨S_z⟩ = gamma * (ħ/2) cos( (gamma B ħ ) t )

Hmm, but we need the oscillation frequency of ⟨mu_z⟩. The frequency is the coefficient of t inside the cosine function divided by 2π.

But wait, in the expression, the cosine is cos( (gamma B ħ ) t ), so the angular frequency omega is (gamma B ħ ). So the frequency f is omega/(2 pi) = (gamma B ħ )/(2 pi).

Wait, but wait, the question is about the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the moment, which is mu_z.

Wait, but in the expectation value, ⟨mu_z⟩ is oscillating as cos( (gamma B ħ ) t ), so the frequency is gamma B ħ / (2 pi).

But wait, looking back, the problem defines mu as gamma S_z. So mu_z = gamma S_z.

But in our calculation, ⟨mu_z⟩ = gamma * ⟨S_z⟩ = gamma * (ħ/2) cos( gamma B ħ t )

Wait, but the question asks for the oscillation frequency, which is the coefficient of t in the cosine term divided by 2pi.

So the angular frequency is omega = gamma B ħ.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation because I forgot the actual energy difference in H2.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the energies more accurately. H2 is gamma B Sy. The eigenvalues of Sy are ± ħ/2. So E_+ = gamma B (ħ/2 ), E_- = - gamma B (ħ/2 ). So the energy difference is E_+ - E_- = gamma B ħ.

But when we compute the time evolution, the phase factors are e^(-i E t / ħ ), right?

So the phase for |+y⟩ is e^{-i E_+ t / ħ } = e^{ -i (gamma B (ħ/2 )) t / ħ } = e^{-i (gamma B t / 2 ) }.

Similarly, phase for |−y⟩ is e^{-i ( - gamma B (ħ/2 )) t / ħ } = e^{ +i (gamma B t / 2 ) }.

So the phase difference between |+y⟩ and |−y⟩ is e^{i gamma B t} (since E_+ - E_- = gamma B ħ, so (E_+ - E_-)/ħ = gamma B.

So the phase factor when calculating the cross terms is e^{i (E_+ - E_- ) t / ħ } = e^{i gamma B t}.

So in the ⟨Sz⟩ expression, the cosine term is cos( gamma B t ), not multiplied by ħ.

Wait, that's a key point. Let me re-examine the energy difference.

E_+ = gamma B ( ħ/2 ), E_- = - gamma B ( ħ/2 ).

So E_+ - E_- = gamma B ħ.

So when calculating the phase difference, we have (E_+ - E_- ) t / ħ = gamma B t.

So the angular frequency omega is gamma B.

So the oscillation frequency is omega/(2 pi) = gamma B/(2 pi).

But wait, the problem asks for the oscillation frequency, which is the coefficient of t in the cosine function divided by 2 pi. So the frequency is f = gamma B/(2 pi).

But looking at the options, the options are in terms of gamma B and sqrt(2) factors.

Wait, the options are:

A) gamma*B/2

B) gamma*B

C) sqrt(2)*gamma*B

D) gamma*B/sqrt(2)

Wait, but my previous conclusion was that the oscillation frequency is gamma B/(2 pi). But none of the options have a 2 pi denominator.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me go back.

Wait, maybe the initial assumption about the Hamiltonian is wrong. Let's think again.

The problem states that mu = gamma S_z. So when the field is along Y, the magnetic moment is aligned with Y. So the Hamiltonian is H = - mu · B.

Wait, the magnetic moment energy is H = - mu · B.

So if mu is gamma S, then H = - gamma S · B.

When B is along Y, H = - gamma B S_y.

So the correct Hamiltonian is H2 = - gamma B Sy.

Wait, that changes the energy eigenvalues.

So, the eigenvalues of H2 are E_+ = - gamma B ( ħ/2 ), and E_- = gamma B ( ħ/2 ).

The energy difference is E_+ - E_- = - gamma B ħ/2 - (gamma B ħ/2 ) = - gamma B ħ.

Wait, but the energy difference is the same in magnitude, so when calculating the phase difference, the sign may not matter because the exponent's argument is based on the difference.

So, the phase difference is (E_+ - E_- ) t / ħ = ( - gamma B ħ ) t / ħ = - gamma B t.

But in the exponential, the phase factor for |+y⟩ is e^{-i E_+ t / ħ }, and for |−y⟩ is e^{-i E_- t / ħ }.

So the phase difference is e^{i (E_+ - E_- ) t / ħ } = e^{i ( - gamma B ħ ) t / ħ } = e^{-i gamma B t}.

Wait, but in the cross terms, (E_+ - E_- ) is negative, so the phase is e^{-i gamma B t}.

Which would lead to a cosine term of -gamma B t, but cosine is even, so it becomes cos(gamma B t).

So the angular frequency is gamma B.

Thus, the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

Looking at the options, option B is gamma*B, option D is gamma B / sqrt(2), etc.

So the answer would be option B.

Wait, but wait.

Another approach: perhaps we can model this as a spin precession. When the magnetic field is in the Y direction, the spin will precess around Y. The Larmor frequency is proportional to the magnetic field. In this case, the frequency would be gamma B.

Wait, the Larmor frequency is omega = gamma B.

So the oscillation frequency of the expectation value of S_z would be omega/2.

Wait, because when a spin precesses, the expectation value of S_z oscillates sinusoidally with frequency omega/2, where omega is the Larmor frequency.

Wait, let me think. When you have a spin in a magnetic field, the precession frequency is omega_L = gamma B. The component of the spin in the direction of the field (Y here) oscillates with this frequency, but the component in the original direction (Z) would oscillate with the same frequency.

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, the expectation value of S_z would oscillate with frequency omega_L, but perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, in the scenario, the initial state is |↑⟩_z, which is along Z. When the field is suddenly changed to Y, the spin starts precessing around Y.

In this case, the expectation value of S_z (which is in the original direction) oscillates with the Larmor frequency.

Wait, another approach: find the time evolution operator and compute the expectation value.

The time evolution operator is U(t) = exp( -i H2 t / ħ ).

H2 = - gamma B Sy.

So U(t) = exp( i gamma B Sy t / ħ ).

The initial state is |↑⟩_z.

The expectation value of Sz is ⟨↑| U†(t) S_z U(t) |↑⟩.

But perhaps it's easier to find this using the eigenbasis of Sy.

Wait, as before, the state |↑⟩_z can be written as (|+y⟩ + |−y⟩)/√2.

The time evolution under H2 = - gamma B Sy is:

|psi(t)⟩ = ( e^{ -i E_+ t/ħ } |+y⟩ + e^{ -i E_- t/ħ } |−y⟩ ) / √2.

E_+ = - gamma B ( ħ/2 ), E_- = gamma B ( ħ/2 ).

So,

e^{ -i E_+ t/ħ } = e^{ i gamma B ( ħ/2 ) t / ħ } = e^{ i gamma B t / 2 }.

Similarly, e^{ -i E_- t/ħ } = e^{ -i gamma B ( ħ/2 ) t / ħ } = e^{ -i gamma B t / 2 }.

So,

|psi(t)⟩ = [ e^{i gamma B t/2 } |+y⟩ + e^{ -i gamma B t/2 } |−y⟩ ] / √2.

Now, to compute ⟨S_z⟩ = ⟨ psi(t) | S_z | psi(t) ⟩.

As before, the cross terms involve ⟨+y| S_z |−y⟩ and its conjugate.

But earlier, when we computed ⟨+y| S_z |−y⟩, we found it to be ħ/2.

So, proceeding, let's compute each term.

⟨psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)⟩ = [ (e^{-i gamma B t/2} ⟨+y| + e^{i gamma B t/2} ⟨−y| ) / √2 ] * S_z [ (e^{i gamma B t/2} |+y⟩ + e^{-i gamma B t/2} |−y⟩ ) / √2 ].

Expanding this, the terms are:

(1/2) [ e^{-i gamma B t/2} e^{i gamma B t/2} ⟨+y| S_z |+y⟩ + e^{-i gamma B t/2} e^{-i gamma B t/2} ⟨+y| S_z |−y⟩ + e^{i gamma B t/2} e^{i gamma B t/2} ⟨−y| S_z |−y⟩ + e^{i gamma B t/2} e^{-i gamma B t/2} ⟨−y| S_z |+y⟩ ]

Simplify the exponents:

First term: e^{i 0} =1 → 1 * 0 = 0.

Second term: e^{-i gamma B t} → multiply by ⟨+y| S_z |−y⟩.

Third term: e^{i gamma B t} → multiply by ⟨−y| S_z |−y⟩.

Fourth term: e^{0} = 1 → multiply by ⟨−y| S_z |+y⟩.

But as before, ⟨+y| S_z |+y⟩ = 0, ⟨−y| S_z |−y⟩ =0.

So the expression simplifies to:

(1/2) [ e^{-i gamma B t} (⟨+y| S_z |−y⟩) + e^{i gamma B t} (⟨−y| S_z |+y⟩) ]

Since ⟨−y| S_z |+y⟩ is the complex conjugate of ⟨+y| S_z |−y⟩, which is real (because S_z is Hermitian and the states are real combinations?), so ⟨−y| S_z |+y⟩ = ⟨+y| S_z |−y⟩ = ħ/2.

So,

= (1/2) [ e^{-i gamma B t} (ħ/2) + e^{i gamma B t} (ħ/2) ]

= (ħ/4) [ e^{-i gamma B t} + e^{i gamma B t} ]

= (ħ/4) * 2 cos(gamma B t )

= (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t )

So, ⟨S_z⟩ = (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

Now, since mu_z = gamma S_z, the average mu_z is gamma * ⟨S_z⟩ = gamma (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

Wait, but this introduces a problem because the unit analysis might be off. Let me think about units.

gamma has units of (rad T)^{-1} or something like that, so gamma*B has units of radians per second.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the natural units where ħ=1, but the problem doesn't specify.

Wait, perhaps the error is in the calculation of the energy levels. Let me double-check the energy eigenvalues.

H2 = - gamma B Sy.

The eigenvalues of Sy are ± ħ/2.

So E_+ = - gamma B ( ħ/2 ), and E_- = gamma B ( ħ/2 ).

So the energy difference is E_+ - E_- = - gamma B ħ.

So when we compute the phase difference, (E_+ - E_- ) t / ħ = (-gamma B ħ ) t/ ħ = -gamma B t.

But when you take e^{i (E_+ - E_- ) t / ħ }, it becomes e^{-i gamma B t}.

But when you compute the cross terms, you have ⟨+y| S_z |−y⟩ multiplied by e^{i (E_+ - E_- ) t / ħ } plus its complex conjugate.

Which would be e^{-i gamma B t} * (ħ/2) + e^{i gamma B t} * (ħ/2 ), leading to (ħ/2) [ e^{-i gamma B t} + e^{i gamma B t} ] = ħ cos(gamma B t).

Wait, but earlier calculation for ⟨S_z⟩ came out to (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t). So the expectation value of Sz is (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t).

But mu_z is gamma times that, so:

⟨mu_z⟩ = gamma * (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t )

Wait, but in terms of angular frequency, the argument is gamma B t, so the angular frequency is gamma B.

The frequency is gamma B divided by 2 pi.

But looking at the options, the options don't involve 2 pi. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial expansion. Let me think again.

Another approach: using time evolution under H2.

The Hamiltonian is H = - gamma B Sy.

The state |↑⟩_z is in the (1,0) state in the Z basis.

Expressed in the Y basis, it's (|+y⟩ + |−y⟩)/√2.

The time evolution for each component is:

|+y⟩ → e^{ -i E_+ t / ħ } |+y⟩.

E_+ = - gamma B (ħ/2 ), so e^{ -i (-gamma B ħ/2 ) t / ħ } = e^{ i gamma B t/2 }.

Similarly, |−y⟩ → e^{ -i E_- t / ħ } |−y⟩.

E_- = gamma B ( ħ/2 ), so e^{ -i (gamma B ħ/2 ) t / ħ } = e^{ -i gamma B t/2 }.

So,

|psi(t)⟩ = [ e^{i gamma B t/2 } |+y⟩ + e^{ -i gamma B t/2 } |−y⟩ ] / √2.

Now, compute the expectation value of S_z.

S_z |+y⟩ = (ħ/2) (|↑⟩ - i |↓⟩ ) / √2.

Similarly, S_z |−y⟩ = (ħ/2) (|↑⟩ + i |↓⟩ ) / √2.

So,

⟨psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)⟩ = [ ( e^{-i gamma B t/2 } ⟨+y| + e^{i gamma B t/2 } ⟨−y| ) / √2 ] * S_z [ ( e^{i gamma B t/2 } |+y⟩ + e^{-i gamma B t/2 } |−y⟩ ) / √2 ]

Expanding:

= [ e^{-i gamma B t/2} e^{i gamma B t/2} ⟨+y| S_z |+y⟩ + e^{-i gamma B t/2} e^{-i gamma B t/2} ⟨+y| S_z |−y⟩ + e^{i gamma B t/2} e^{i gamma B t/2} ⟨−y| S_z |−y⟩ + e^{i gamma B t/2} e^{-i gamma B t/2} ⟨−y| S_z |+y⟩ ] / 2.

Again, the first and third terms are zero because ⟨+y| S_z |+y⟩ and ⟨−y| S_z |−y⟩ are zero.

The cross terms:

Second term: e^{-i gamma B t} ⟨+y| S_z |−y⟩ = e^{-i gamma B t} (ħ/2 )

Fourth term: e^{0} ⟨−y| S_z |+y⟩ = (ħ/2 )

So,

⟨psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)⟩ = [ (ħ/2) e^{-i gamma B t} + (ħ/2) e^{i gamma B t} ] / 2 

= (ħ/4) [ e^{-i gamma B t} + e^{i gamma B t} ]

= (ħ/4) * 2 cos(gamma B t )

= (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t )

So, the expectation value of S_z is (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t ). Thus, the average of mu_z is gamma * (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t ).

Wait, but mu_z is in units of energy times time or something else? I'm getting a bit stuck on the units, but perhaps I should proceed.

The oscillation occurs with angular frequency omega = gamma B.

So, the frequency is omega/(2 pi) = gamma B/(2 pi).

But looking at the options provided, none of them have a denominator involving pi or 2 pi. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, or perhaps the problem is considering the angular frequency as the oscillation frequency.

Wait, the problem says, "the average of the z-component of the particle’s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?"

The oscillation frequency is the number of cycles per second, which is the angular frequency divided by 2 pi.

But according to the options, option B is gamma*B, which would correspond to the angular frequency.

But wait, the problem could have the options in terms of angular frequency. So the answer would be option B, gamma*B.

But another possibility is that when the energy difference is delta E = gamma B ħ, the frequency is delta E / h-bar = gamma B.

Wait, delta E = gamma B ħ → frequency f = delta E / h-bar = gamma B.

So, the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

Thus, the correct answer is option B.

The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\mu = \gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+z$ direction. The field is then switched to point along the $+y$ direction, and the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the magnetic moment, $\langle \mu_z \rangle$, is to be determined.

### Key Analysis

1. **Initial State and Hamiltonian**:  
   Initially, the particle is in the eigenstate of $S_z$, specifically $| \uparrow \rangle_z$. The Hamiltonian before the field change is proportional to $S_z$. After the field is switched to the $+y$ direction, the new Hamiltonian is $H = -\gamma B S_y$. The eigenstates of $S_y$ are $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$, with eigenvalues $\pm \hbar/2$.

2. **State Expansion**:  
   The initial state $| \uparrow \rangle_z$ is expressed in terms of the eigenstates of $S_y$ as:  
   \[
   | \uparrow \rangle_z = \frac{|+y\rangle + |-y\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}.
   \]

3. **Time Evolution**:  
   Under the new Hamiltonian $H = -\gamma B S_y$, the time evolution of the state is:  
   \[
   |\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{e^{-iE_+t/\hbar}|+y\rangle + e^{-iE_-t/\hbar}|-y\rangle}{\sqrt{2}},
   \]  
   where $E_+ = -\gamma B \hbar/2$ and $E_- = \gamma B \hbar/2$. The energy difference is $\Delta E = E_+ - E_- = -\gamma B \hbar$.

4. **Expectation Value of $S_z$**:  
   The expectation value of $S_z$ is computed as:  
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \langle \psi(t) | S_z | \psi(t) \rangle.
   \]  
   Expanding this, the diagonal terms vanish because $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$ are not eigenstates of $S_z$. The cross terms involve $\langle +y | S_z | -y \rangle$ and $\langle -y | S_z | +y \rangle$, which are equal to $\hbar/2$ and $\hbar/2$, respectively. The result simplifies to:  
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t).
   \]

5. **Oscillation Frequency**:  
   The oscillation of $\langle S_z \rangle$ has an angular frequency $\omega = \gamma B$. Since $\mu_z = \gamma S_z$, the oscillation frequency of $\langle \mu_z \rangle$ is the same as that of $\langle S_z \rangle$.

6. **Matching to Options**:  
   The oscillation frequency is $\gamma B$, which corresponds to **Option B**.

### Final Answer
**Answer: B**

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and its magnetic moment. Hmm, I remember that spin-1/2 particles, like electrons, have their own magnetic moments. The problem says the magnetic moment mu is equal to gamma times Sz. Oh right, gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, and Sz is the spin component along the magnetic field direction.

So initially, the magnetic field is pointing in the +Z direction. The particle's magnetic moment is aligned with this field, so I guess that means it's in an eigenstate of Sz, either spin-up or spin-down. Being aligned, it's probably in the spin-up state because the magnetic moment would align with the field direction.

Then, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. Wait, when the field is turned off, does that mean the Hamiltonian changes? Because the magnetic field affects the Hamiltonian through the Zeeman term. So the initial Hamiltonian was proportional to Sz, and then it's changed to proportional to Sy.

The question is about the average of the z-component of the particle’s moment oscillating. So we're looking at the expectation value of Sz over time, and it's oscillating. What causes oscillations in expectation values? I think it's when the system is in a superposition of energy eigenstates, leading to interference terms that vary with time.

Wait, so initially, when the field was along Z, the particle is in an eigenstate of Sz. Let me think about the Hamiltonian. The initial Hamiltonian is H1 = -gamma B Sz. Oh wait, actually, I think the energy is given by the Zeeman interaction, which is something like mu·B. So mu is gamma Sz, and B is along Z, so the energy is gamma B Sz. But the sign might not matter for this problem.

When the field is switched to Y, the new Hamiltonian is H2 = gamma B Sy. So the system's Hamiltonian suddenly changes from H1 to H2. Wait, when the field is turned off and another turned on, the change is instantaneous. So the state of the system doesn't change instantly; it's still the same as before, but the Hamiltonian governing its evolution does.

So the initial state is an eigenstate of Sz. Let's denote the spin-up state as |↑⟩_z. But under the new Hamiltonian H2 = gamma B Sy, this state is no longer an eigenstate. So the system will evolve over time, and the expectation values may oscillate.

What's the expectation value of Sz in this new scenario? Let's model this.

The initial state is |↑⟩_z. I can express this state in terms of the eigenstates of H2. The eigenstates of Sy are |+⟩_y and |−⟩_y. Let me recall the eigenstates of Sy. The spin matrices for Sx and Sy are different, but I think the eigenstates for Sy are (|↑⟩_z + i|↓⟩_z)/√2 and (|↑⟩_z - i|↓⟩_z)/√2, or something like that.

Wait, the eigenstates of Sy can be written as |+y⟩ = (|↑⟩ + i|↓⟩)/√2 and |−y⟩ = (|↑⟩ − i|↓⟩)/√2. So the initial state |↑⟩_z is a combination of these.

Let me compute the expansion of |↑⟩_z in terms of |+y⟩ and |−y⟩. Let's write:

|↑⟩_z = a |+y⟩ + b |−y⟩.

Plugging in the expressions for |+y⟩ and |−y⟩:

|↑⟩_z = a (|↑⟩ + i|↓⟩)/√2 + b (|↑⟩ − i|↓⟩)/√2.

Grouping terms:

= [ (a + b)/√2 ] |↑⟩ + [i a - i b)/√2 ] |↓⟩.

But |↑⟩_z is just |↑⟩, so the coefficients for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ must match.

So, [ (a + b)/√2 ] = 1,
and [ i (a - b) ) / √2 ] = 0.

From the second equation: i (a - b) = 0 → a = b.

Plugging into the first equation: (a + a)/√2 = 1 → 2a/√2 = 1 → a = √2/2.

So a = b = 1/√2.

So, |↑⟩_z = (|+y⟩ + |−y⟩)/√2.

Wait, because a and b are both 1/√2.

Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake in the expansion. Let me double-check.

Wait, the eigenstates are |+y⟩ = (|↑⟩ + i|↓⟩)/√2 and |−y⟩ = (|↑⟩ - i|↓⟩)/√2.

So when I expand |↑⟩ in terms of |+y⟩ and |−y⟩, I get:

|↑⟩ = [ (|+y⟩ + |−y⟩) ] / √2.

Wait, let's compute the coefficients. Let me express |↑⟩ in terms of |+y⟩ and |−y⟩.

|↑⟩ = (|+y⟩ + |−y⟩) / √2.

Because:

|+y⟩ + |−y⟩ = [ (|↑⟩ + i|↓⟩) + (|↑⟩ - i|↓⟩) ] /√2 → [2|↑⟩] / √2 → √2 |↑⟩.

So |↑⟩ = (|+y⟩ + |−y⟩)/√2.

So in the new basis, the initial state is a superposition of |+y⟩ and |−y⟩, each with coefficients 1/√2.

Now, the new Hamiltonian H2 is proportional to Sy, so its eigenstates are |+y⟩ and |−y⟩, with energies E+ and E-.

Wait, let me compute the energy eigenvalues. The Hamiltonian is H2 = gamma B Sy. The eigenvalues of Sy are ħ/2 * (1 and -1) in units where ħ is 1, perhaps. Wait, for spin-1/2, Sx, Sy, Sz each have eigenvalues ± ħ/2. But in the particle's magnetic moment, mu is gamma S, so perhaps in terms of the Hamiltonian, each component would contribute to the energy as gamma B S_z, etc.

Wait, the Hamiltonian for the magnetic moment in a magnetic field is usually H = -mu · B. But in this problem, mu is given as gamma S, so H = -gamma B (S · n), where n is the direction of B. Wait the problem says mu = gamma S_z, but perhaps that's when B is along z. Oh wait, the problem says mu = gamma S_z, but when the field is along Y, the magnetic moment would be gamma S_y? Or wait no, mu is the magnetic moment which is gamma S_z when the field is along Z. But when the field is along Y, the magnetic moment would interact with the field via Sy. Hmm, perhaps the Hamiltonian after the field is turned on along Y is H2 = gamma B S_y.

Wait, let's think. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, but when the field is along a different direction, the interaction is mu · B. So if the field is along Y, the interaction is gamma (S · B) = gamma B S_y.

So H2 = gamma B S_y.

The eigenstates of S_y are |+y⟩ and |−y⟩, with eigenvalues ± ħ/2. But in the problem, perhaps we're using units where ħ=1, or perhaps it's already accounted for in gamma. Not sure, but probably, for our purposes, the energies are plus and minus (gamma B / 2).

Wait, let me clarify. The energy eigenvalues for H2 are E = gamma B (± ħ/2) ? Or perhaps the spin matrices are being used without the ħ factor. Wait, in quantum mechanics, the spin matrices have eigenvalues ± ħ/2, but perhaps in the problem, gamma already includes any necessary constants, or perhaps we're using units where ħ=1.

But perhaps for our purposes, the energy levels are E_+ = gamma B (1/2) and E_- = - gamma B (1/2). Wait, no, because the eigenvalues of S_y are ± ħ/2, but in the problem statement, mu is given as gamma S_z, so perhaps the Hamiltonian is H = -mu · B. Wait, but the initial magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z, but when the field is in Y direction, mu would be gamma S_y? Or perhaps mu is fixed as gamma S_z, but the field is along Y, so the interaction is gamma S_z * B_y? Hmm, I might be getting confused here.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the Hamiltonian as H = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, because mu is gamma S, but when the field is along Y, the interaction is mu · B = gamma S · B. So if B is along Y, then H = -gamma B S_y. Wait, but in the first part, when the field was along Z, H was -gamma B S_z.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem defines mu as gamma S, so when the field is along Y, the Hamiltonian is H = -mu · B = -gamma B S_y, but the sign may not matter because we're concerned with the energy differences.

But perhaps in the problem, the actual value of the energy is not as important as the energy difference between the eigenstates. Because for oscillations, the frequency is determined by the energy difference over h-bar.

Wait, but in any case, let's proceed. The initial state after the field change is |↑⟩_z, which we've written as (|+y⟩ + |−y⟩)/√2.

The time evolution under H2 is given by each component evolving with its phase. So each component |+y⟩ and |−y⟩ will contribute a phase factor of e^(-i E t / ħ).

But let's compute the expectation value of Sz at time t.

The initial state is |psi(0)⟩ = (|+y⟩ + |−y⟩)/√2.

After time t, the state is |psi(t)⟩ = (e^{-i E_+ t / ħ} |+y⟩ + e^{-i E_- t / ħ} |−y⟩)/√2.

Now, we want to find the expectation value of Sz: ⟨Sz⟩ = ⟨psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)⟩.

Let me remember that S_z has eigenstates |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. The |+y⟩ and |−y⟩ states can be written in terms of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express S_z in the |+y⟩, |−y⟩ basis.

Wait, let me compute the matrix elements of S_z in the |+y⟩, |−y⟩ basis.

The |+y⟩ state is (|↑⟩ + i |↓⟩)/√2, and |−y⟩ is (|↑⟩ - i |↓⟩)/√2.

So, S_z |+y⟩ = (S_z |↑⟩ + i S_z |↓⟩ ) /√2 = ( (ħ/2) |↑⟩ + i (-ħ/2) |↓⟩ ) /√2.

Which is (ħ/2) [ |↑⟩ - i |↓⟩ ] /√2.

Hmm, but perhaps this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the expectation value using the expansion of the states.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value of S_z in the state |psi(t)⟩.

So let's write |psi(t)⟩ = (e^{-i E_+ t/ħ} |+y⟩ + e^{-i E_- t/ħ} |−y⟩ ) /√2.

To find ⟨Sz⟩, we can compute ⟨psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)⟩.

But S_z acts on |+y⟩ and |−y⟩ in some way. Alternatively, perhaps express S_z in the |+y⟩ and |−y⟩ basis.

Wait, perhaps the matrix elements for S_z in the |+y⟩ basis can be found.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that S_z and S_y don't commute, so when the state is expressed in the |+y⟩ and |−y⟩ basis, S_z has off-diagonal elements.

Alternatively, perhaps a smarter approach is to note that the time evolution will cause the state to precess, leading to oscillations in the expectation values.

Wait, but maybe a better approach is to calculate the energy levels and then find the transition frequency.

The energy eigenvalues for H2 are E_+ = (gamma B) (ħ/2) and E_- = - (gamma B) (ħ/2). Wait, but wait, the spin matrices have eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So if H2 is gamma B Sy, then E_+ = gamma B (ħ/2), and E_- = -gamma B (ħ/2).

But perhaps I should be careful with signs. Let me think again. The Hamiltonian is H2 = gamma B Sy.

Sy has eigenvalues ± (ħ/2). So E_+ = gamma B (ħ/2), and E_- = gamma B (- ħ/2).

The energy difference between E_+ and E_- is gamma B (ħ/2) - ( - gamma B (ħ/2) ) ) = gamma B ħ.

But wait, the time evolution will cause the phases to differ by the energy difference multiplied by time.

So the system is in a superposition of these two energy eigenstates. The time-dependent phase difference between the two components will lead to oscillations in expectation values.

The initial state is |psi(0)⟩ = (|+y⟩ + |−y⟩)/√2.

So the state at time t is |psi(t)⟩ = (e^{-i E_+ t/ħ} |+y⟩ + e^{-i E_- t/ħ} |−y⟩ ) /√2.

The expectation value of Sz is ⟨psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)⟩.

Let me compute this:

⟨psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)⟩ = [ (⟨+y| e^{i E_+ t/ħ} + ⟨−y| e^{i E_- t/ħ} ) /√2 ] * S_z [ (|+y⟩ e^{-i E_+ t/ħ} + |−y⟩ e^{-i E_- t/ħ} ) /√2 ].

Expanding this, we get:

(1/2) [ ⟨+y| e^{i E_+ t} S_z |+y⟩ e^{-i E_+ t} + ⟨+y| e^{i E_+ t} S_z |−y⟩ e^{-i E_- t} + ⟨−y| e^{i E_- t} S_z |+y⟩ e^{-i E_+ t} + ⟨−y| e^{i E_- t} S_z |−y⟩ e^{-i E_- t} ].

Simplify each term:

The first term is ⟨+y| S_z |+y⟩.

The second term is e^{i (E_+ - E_-) t} ⟨+y| S_z |−y⟩.

The third term is e^{i (E_- - E_+) t} ⟨−y| S_z |+y⟩.

The fourth term is ⟨−y| S_z |−y⟩.

Now, let's compute these matrix elements.

First, what is ⟨+y| S_z |+y⟩?

|+y⟩ = (|↑⟩ + i |↓⟩)/√2.

So S_z |+y⟩ = (S_z |↑⟩ + i S_z |↓⟩ ) /√2 = ( (ħ/2) |↑⟩ + i (- ħ/2) |↓⟩ ) /√2.

Taking the inner product with ⟨+y|:

⟨+y| S_z |+y⟩ = (⟨↑| + i ⟨↓| ) ( (ħ/2) |↑⟩ - i (ħ/2)|↓⟩ ) ) / 2.

Wait, because ⟨+y| is (⟨↑| - i ⟨↓| ) / √2 ? Wait no, earlier we wrote |+y⟩ as (|↑⟩ + i |↓⟩)/√2, so ⟨+y| should be (⟨↑| - i ⟨↓| ) /√2.

So,

⟨+y| S_z |+y⟩ = [ (⟨↑| - i ⟨↓| ) /√2 ] * [ (ħ/2 |↑⟩ - i ħ/2 |↓⟩ ) /√2 ].

Multiplying them:

= [ (⟨↑| (ħ/2 |↑⟩ ) ) + (⟨↑| (-i ħ/2 |↓⟩ )) ) + (-i ⟨↓| (ħ/2 |↑⟩ ) ) + ( (-i)(-i) ⟨↓| (ħ/2 |↓⟩ )) ) ] / 2.

Each term:

⟨↑| (ħ/2 |↑⟩ ) = ħ/2.

⟨↑| (-i ħ/2 |↓⟩ ) = 0.

(-i) ⟨↓| (ħ/2 |↑⟩ ) = 0.

⟨↓| (i^2) (ħ/2 |↓⟩ ) → wait, (-i)(-i) is (i^2)= (-1), so that term is (-1) (ħ/2) ⟨↓| ↓ ⟩ = (-1)(ħ/2).

So adding up:

(ħ/2 + 0 + 0 - ħ/2 ) / 2 = 0.

So ⟨+y| S_z |+y⟩ = 0.

Similarly, ⟨−y| S_z |−y⟩ can be computed. Let's see.

|−y⟩ = (|↑⟩ - i |↓⟩)/√2.

S_z |−y⟩ = (S_z |↑⟩ - i S_z |↓⟩ ) /√2 = ( (ħ/2)|↑⟩ - i ( - ħ/2 ) |↓⟩ ) /√2 = ( ħ/2 |↑⟩ + i (ħ/2) |↓⟩ ) /√2.

⟨−y| S_z |−y⟩ = (⟨↑| + i ⟨↓| ) /√2 * [ (ħ/2 |↑⟩ + i (ħ/2) |↓⟩ ) ] /√2.

Expanding:

⟨↑| (ħ/2 |↑⟩ ) = ħ/2.

⟨↑| (i ħ/2 |↓⟩ ) = 0.

i ⟨↓| (ħ/2 |↑⟩ ) = 0.

i ⟨↓| (i ħ/2 |↓⟩ ) = i^2 (ħ/2) ⟨↓| ↓⟩ = (-1)(ħ/2).

Adding:

( ħ/2 - ħ/2 ) / 2 = 0.

So ⟨−y| S_z |−y⟩ = 0.

So the first and fourth terms in the expectation value expression are zero.

Now, the cross terms: the second and third terms.

Term 2: e^{i (E_+ - E_-) t} ⟨+y| S_z |−y⟩.

Term 3: e^{i (E_- - E_+ ) t} ⟨−y| S_z |+y⟩.

Note that ⟨−y| S_z |+y⟩ is the complex conjugate of ⟨+y| S_z |−y⟩, because S_z is Hermitian.

So let me compute ⟨+y| S_z |−y⟩.

Again, express |±y⟩ in terms of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩.

⟨+y| S_z |−y⟩ = (⟨↑| - i ⟨↓| ) /√2 * S_z * (|↑⟩ - i |↓⟩ ) /√2.

Compute S_z (|↑⟩ - i |↓⟩ ) = (ħ/2 |↑⟩ ) - i ( - ħ/2 |↓⟩ ) = ħ/2 |↑⟩ + i ħ/2 |↓⟩.

So,

⟨+y| S_z |−y⟩ = (⟨↑| - i ⟨↓| ) [ (ħ/2 |↑⟩ + i ħ/2 |↓⟩ ) ] / 2.

Multiplying out:

⟨↑| (ħ/2 |↑⟩ ) = ħ/2.

⟨↑| (i ħ/2 |↓⟩ ) = 0.

(-i ⟨↓| (ħ/2 |↑⟩ ) = (-i) (0) ) = 0.

(-i ⟨↓| (i ħ/2 |↓⟩ ) ) = (-i)(i) (ħ/2) ⟨↓| ↓⟩ = (1)(ħ/2).

So total: (ħ/2 + ħ/2 ) / 2 = ( ħ ) / 2.

Wait, no. Let me redo this calculation.

Wait, let me compute each part:

⟨↑| multiplied by (ħ/2 |↑⟩ ) gives ħ/2.

⟨↑| multiplied by (i ħ/2 |↓⟩ ) gives 0.

(-i ⟨↓| ) multiplied by (ħ/2 |↑⟩ ) gives (-i)(0) → 0.

(-i ⟨↓| ) multiplied by (i ħ/2 |↓⟩ ) gives (-i)(i) (ħ/2) ) = (-i^2) (ħ/2) = (1)(ħ/2).

So adding these contributions: ħ/2 + ħ/2 = ħ.

Then, divide by 2 (from the denominator of each state), so:

⟨+y| S_z |−y⟩ = ħ / 2.

Wait, no, the denominator is √2 * √2 = 2, so all the terms above (which sum to ħ) are divided by 2. So the total is ħ/2.

Wait, no, wait, perhaps I missed a step. Let me think again.

Wait, the calculation was:

(⟨↑| - i ⟨↓| ) (ħ/2 |↑⟩ + i ħ/2 |↓⟩ ) / (2).

Expanding:

= [ ⟨↑| (ħ/2 |↑⟩ ) + ⟨↑| (i ħ/2 |↓⟩ ) - i ⟨↓| ( ħ/2 |↑⟩ ) - i ⟨↓| (i ħ/2 |↓⟩ ) ] / 2.

Each term:

⟨↑| (ħ/2 |↑⟩ ) → (ħ/2)(1) = ħ/2.

⟨↑| (i ħ/2 |↓⟩ ) → 0.

- i ⟨↓| ( ħ/2 |↑⟩ ) → 0.

- i ⟨↓| (i ħ/2 |↓⟩ ) → (-i)(i) (ħ/2)(1) )= (1)(ħ/2).

So sum of terms is (ħ/2 + ħ/2) = ħ, then divided by 2 → ħ/2.

So ⟨+y| S_z |−y⟩ = ħ/2.

Similarly, ⟨−y| S_z |+y⟩ is the complex conjugate, which would be ħ/2. Because S_z is Hermitian, so ⟨−y| S_z |+y⟩ = (⟨+y| S_z |−y⟩ )* → (ħ/2)* = ħ/2 (since it's real).

So the cross terms are:

Term2: e^{i (E_+ - E_- ) t} * (ħ/2) 
Term3: e^{i (E_- - E_+ ) t} * (ħ/2) = e^{-i (E_+ - E_- ) t} * (ħ/2 )

So the sum of Term2 and Term3 is:

(ħ/2) [ e^{i Δ E t} + e^{-i Δ E t} ] 

where Δ E = (E_+ - E_- ) = (gamma B (ħ/2) ) - ( - gamma B (ħ/2) ) ) = gamma B ħ.

Wait, E_+ = (gamma B) (ħ/2 ), E_- = - (gamma B) (ħ/2 ).

So E_+ - E_- = gamma B ħ.

So,

Term2 + Term3 = (ħ/2) [ e^{i (gamma B ħ) t} + e^{-i (gamma B ħ) t} ] 
= (ħ/2) * 2 cos( gamma B ħ t )
= ħ cos( gamma B ħ t )

So putting it all together, the expectation value ⟨Sz⟩ is:

⟨Sz⟩ = 0 + (ħ/2) [ e^{i gamma B ħ t} + e^{-i gamma B ħ t} ] * (1/2) ?

Wait, no, earlier the expansion after expanding all terms gave the cross terms. Let me re-examine.

Wait, in the expectation value calculation, the only terms that contribute are the cross terms, which are Term2 and Term3. The entire expression for ⟨Sz⟩ is:

⟨Sz⟩ = (1/2) [ Term2 + Term3 ]

= (1/2) * (ħ/2) [ e^{i Δ E t} + e^{-i Δ E t} ]

= (ħ/4) [ 2 cos(Δ E t) ]

= (ħ/2) cos(Δ E t )

So,

⟨Sz⟩ = (ħ/2) cos( (gamma B ħ ) t )

Wait, but the problem states that the oscillation frequency is for the average of the z-component of the moment, which is gamma times the expectation value of S_z, because mu_z = gamma S_z.

So the average mu_z is gamma * ⟨S_z⟩.

So,

⟨mu_z⟩ = gamma * ⟨S_z⟩ = gamma * (ħ/2) cos( (gamma B ħ ) t )

Hmm, but we need the oscillation frequency of ⟨mu_z⟩. The frequency is the coefficient of t inside the cosine function divided by 2π.

But wait, in the expression, the cosine is cos( (gamma B ħ ) t ), so the angular frequency omega is (gamma B ħ ). So the frequency f is omega/(2 pi) = (gamma B ħ )/(2 pi).

Wait, but wait, the question is about the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the moment, which is mu_z.

Wait, but in the expectation value, ⟨mu_z⟩ is oscillating as cos( (gamma B ħ ) t ), so the frequency is gamma B ħ / (2 pi).

But wait, looking back, the problem defines mu as gamma S_z. So mu_z = gamma S_z.

But in our calculation, ⟨mu_z⟩ = gamma * ⟨S_z⟩ = gamma * (ħ/2) cos( gamma B ħ t )

Wait, but the question asks for the oscillation frequency, which is the coefficient of t in the cosine term divided by 2pi.

So the angular frequency is omega = gamma B ħ.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation because I forgot the actual energy difference in H2.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the energies more accurately. H2 is gamma B Sy. The eigenvalues of Sy are ± ħ/2. So E_+ = gamma B (ħ/2 ), E_- = - gamma B (ħ/2 ). So the energy difference is E_+ - E_- = gamma B ħ.

But when we compute the time evolution, the phase factors are e^(-i E t / ħ ), right?

So the phase for |+y⟩ is e^{-i E_+ t / ħ } = e^{ -i (gamma B (ħ/2 )) t / ħ } = e^{-i (gamma B t / 2 ) }.

Similarly, phase for |−y⟩ is e^{-i ( - gamma B (ħ/2 )) t / ħ } = e^{ +i (gamma B t / 2 ) }.

So the phase difference between |+y⟩ and |−y⟩ is e^{i gamma B t} (since E_+ - E_- = gamma B ħ, so (E_+ - E_-)/ħ = gamma B.

So the phase factor when calculating the cross terms is e^{i (E_+ - E_- ) t / ħ } = e^{i gamma B t}.

So in the ⟨Sz⟩ expression, the cosine term is cos( gamma B t ), not multiplied by ħ.

Wait, that's a key point. Let me re-examine the energy difference.

E_+ = gamma B ( ħ/2 ), E_- = - gamma B ( ħ/2 ).

So E_+ - E_- = gamma B ħ.

So when calculating the phase difference, we have (E_+ - E_- ) t / ħ = gamma B t.

So the angular frequency omega is gamma B.

So the oscillation frequency is omega/(2 pi) = gamma B/(2 pi).

But wait, the problem asks for the oscillation frequency, which is the coefficient of t in the cosine function divided by 2 pi. So the frequency is f = gamma B/(2 pi).

But looking at the options, the options are in terms of gamma B and sqrt(2) factors.

Wait, the options are:

A) gamma*B/2

B) gamma*B

C) sqrt(2)*gamma*B

D) gamma*B/sqrt(2)

Wait, but my previous conclusion was that the oscillation frequency is gamma B/(2 pi). But none of the options have a 2 pi denominator.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me go back.

Wait, maybe the initial assumption about the Hamiltonian is wrong. Let's think again.

The problem states that mu = gamma S_z. So when the field is along Y, the magnetic moment is aligned with Y. So the Hamiltonian is H = - mu · B.

Wait, the magnetic moment energy is H = - mu · B.

So if mu is gamma S, then H = - gamma S · B.

When B is along Y, H = - gamma B S_y.

So the correct Hamiltonian is H2 = - gamma B Sy.

Wait, that changes the energy eigenvalues.

So, the eigenvalues of H2 are E_+ = - gamma B ( ħ/2 ), and E_- = gamma B ( ħ/2 ).

The energy difference is E_+ - E_- = - gamma B ħ/2 - (gamma B ħ/2 ) = - gamma B ħ.

Wait, but the energy difference is the same in magnitude, so when calculating the phase difference, the sign may not matter because the exponent's argument is based on the difference.

So, the phase difference is (E_+ - E_- ) t / ħ = ( - gamma B ħ ) t / ħ = - gamma B t.

But in the exponential, the phase factor for |+y⟩ is e^{-i E_+ t / ħ }, and for |−y⟩ is e^{-i E_- t / ħ }.

So the phase difference is e^{i (E_+ - E_- ) t / ħ } = e^{i ( - gamma B ħ ) t / ħ } = e^{-i gamma B t}.

Wait, but in the cross terms, (E_+ - E_- ) is negative, so the phase is e^{-i gamma B t}.

Which would lead to a cosine term of -gamma B t, but cosine is even, so it becomes cos(gamma B t).

So the angular frequency is gamma B.

Thus, the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

Looking at the options, option B is gamma*B, option D is gamma B / sqrt(2), etc.

So the answer would be option B.

Wait, but wait.

Another approach: perhaps we can model this as a spin precession. When the magnetic field is in the Y direction, the spin will precess around Y. The Larmor frequency is proportional to the magnetic field. In this case, the frequency would be gamma B.

Wait, the Larmor frequency is omega = gamma B.

So the oscillation frequency of the expectation value of S_z would be omega/2.

Wait, because when a spin precesses, the expectation value of S_z oscillates sinusoidally with frequency omega/2, where omega is the Larmor frequency.

Wait, let me think. When you have a spin in a magnetic field, the precession frequency is omega_L = gamma B. The component of the spin in the direction of the field (Y here) oscillates with this frequency, but the component in the original direction (Z) would oscillate with the same frequency.

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, the expectation value of S_z would oscillate with frequency omega_L, but perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, in the scenario, the initial state is |↑⟩_z, which is along Z. When the field is suddenly changed to Y, the spin starts precessing around Y.

In this case, the expectation value of S_z (which is in the original direction) oscillates with the Larmor frequency.

Wait, another approach: find the time evolution operator and compute the expectation value.

The time evolution operator is U(t) = exp( -i H2 t / ħ ).

H2 = - gamma B Sy.

So U(t) = exp( i gamma B Sy t / ħ ).

The initial state is |↑⟩_z.

The expectation value of Sz is ⟨↑| U†(t) S_z U(t) |↑⟩.

But perhaps it's easier to find this using the eigenbasis of Sy.

Wait, as before, the state |↑⟩_z can be written as (|+y⟩ + |−y⟩)/√2.

The time evolution under H2 = - gamma B Sy is:

|psi(t)⟩ = ( e^{ -i E_+ t/ħ } |+y⟩ + e^{ -i E_- t/ħ } |−y⟩ ) / √2.

E_+ = - gamma B ( ħ/2 ), E_- = gamma B ( ħ/2 ).

So,

e^{ -i E_+ t/ħ } = e^{ i gamma B ( ħ/2 ) t / ħ } = e^{ i gamma B t / 2 }.

Similarly, e^{ -i E_- t/ħ } = e^{ -i gamma B ( ħ/2 ) t / ħ } = e^{ -i gamma B t / 2 }.

So,

|psi(t)⟩ = [ e^{i gamma B t/2 } |+y⟩ + e^{ -i gamma B t/2 } |−y⟩ ] / √2.

Now, to compute ⟨S_z⟩ = ⟨ psi(t) | S_z | psi(t) ⟩.

As before, the cross terms involve ⟨+y| S_z |−y⟩ and its conjugate.

But earlier, when we computed ⟨+y| S_z |−y⟩, we found it to be ħ/2.

So, proceeding, let's compute each term.

⟨psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)⟩ = [ (e^{-i gamma B t/2} ⟨+y| + e^{i gamma B t/2} ⟨−y| ) / √2 ] * S_z [ (e^{i gamma B t/2} |+y⟩ + e^{-i gamma B t/2} |−y⟩ ) / √2 ].

Expanding this, the terms are:

(1/2) [ e^{-i gamma B t/2} e^{i gamma B t/2} ⟨+y| S_z |+y⟩ + e^{-i gamma B t/2} e^{-i gamma B t/2} ⟨+y| S_z |−y⟩ + e^{i gamma B t/2} e^{i gamma B t/2} ⟨−y| S_z |−y⟩ + e^{i gamma B t/2} e^{-i gamma B t/2} ⟨−y| S_z |+y⟩ ]

Simplify the exponents:

First term: e^{i 0} =1 → 1 * 0 = 0.

Second term: e^{-i gamma B t} → multiply by ⟨+y| S_z |−y⟩.

Third term: e^{i gamma B t} → multiply by ⟨−y| S_z |−y⟩.

Fourth term: e^{0} = 1 → multiply by ⟨−y| S_z |+y⟩.

But as before, ⟨+y| S_z |+y⟩ = 0, ⟨−y| S_z |−y⟩ =0.

So the expression simplifies to:

(1/2) [ e^{-i gamma B t} (⟨+y| S_z |−y⟩) + e^{i gamma B t} (⟨−y| S_z |+y⟩) ]

Since ⟨−y| S_z |+y⟩ is the complex conjugate of ⟨+y| S_z |−y⟩, which is real (because S_z is Hermitian and the states are real combinations?), so ⟨−y| S_z |+y⟩ = ⟨+y| S_z |−y⟩ = ħ/2.

So,

= (1/2) [ e^{-i gamma B t} (ħ/2) + e^{i gamma B t} (ħ/2) ]

= (ħ/4) [ e^{-i gamma B t} + e^{i gamma B t} ]

= (ħ/4) * 2 cos(gamma B t )

= (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t )

So, ⟨S_z⟩ = (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

Now, since mu_z = gamma S_z, the average mu_z is gamma * ⟨S_z⟩ = gamma (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

Wait, but this introduces a problem because the unit analysis might be off. Let me think about units.

gamma has units of (rad T)^{-1} or something like that, so gamma*B has units of radians per second.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the natural units where ħ=1, but the problem doesn't specify.

Wait, perhaps the error is in the calculation of the energy levels. Let me double-check the energy eigenvalues.

H2 = - gamma B Sy.

The eigenvalues of Sy are ± ħ/2.

So E_+ = - gamma B ( ħ/2 ), and E_- = gamma B ( ħ/2 ).

So the energy difference is E_+ - E_- = - gamma B ħ.

So when we compute the phase difference, (E_+ - E_- ) t / ħ = (-gamma B ħ ) t/ ħ = -gamma B t.

But when you take e^{i (E_+ - E_- ) t / ħ }, it becomes e^{-i gamma B t}.

But when you compute the cross terms, you have ⟨+y| S_z |−y⟩ multiplied by e^{i (E_+ - E_- ) t / ħ } plus its complex conjugate.

Which would be e^{-i gamma B t} * (ħ/2) + e^{i gamma B t} * (ħ/2 ), leading to (ħ/2) [ e^{-i gamma B t} + e^{i gamma B t} ] = ħ cos(gamma B t).

Wait, but earlier calculation for ⟨S_z⟩ came out to (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t). So the expectation value of Sz is (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t).

But mu_z is gamma times that, so:

⟨mu_z⟩ = gamma * (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t )

Wait, but in terms of angular frequency, the argument is gamma B t, so the angular frequency is gamma B.

The frequency is gamma B divided by 2 pi.

But looking at the options, the options don't involve 2 pi. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial expansion. Let me think again.

Another approach: using time evolution under H2.

The Hamiltonian is H = - gamma B Sy.

The state |↑⟩_z is in the (1,0) state in the Z basis.

Expressed in the Y basis, it's (|+y⟩ + |−y⟩)/√2.

The time evolution for each component is:

|+y⟩ → e^{ -i E_+ t / ħ } |+y⟩.

E_+ = - gamma B (ħ/2 ), so e^{ -i (-gamma B ħ/2 ) t / ħ } = e^{ i gamma B t/2 }.

Similarly, |−y⟩ → e^{ -i E_- t / ħ } |−y⟩.

E_- = gamma B ( ħ/2 ), so e^{ -i (gamma B ħ/2 ) t / ħ } = e^{ -i gamma B t/2 }.

So,

|psi(t)⟩ = [ e^{i gamma B t/2 } |+y⟩ + e^{ -i gamma B t/2 } |−y⟩ ] / √2.

Now, compute the expectation value of S_z.

S_z |+y⟩ = (ħ/2) (|↑⟩ - i |↓⟩ ) / √2.

Similarly, S_z |−y⟩ = (ħ/2) (|↑⟩ + i |↓⟩ ) / √2.

So,

⟨psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)⟩ = [ ( e^{-i gamma B t/2 } ⟨+y| + e^{i gamma B t/2 } ⟨−y| ) / √2 ] * S_z [ ( e^{i gamma B t/2 } |+y⟩ + e^{-i gamma B t/2 } |−y⟩ ) / √2 ]

Expanding:

= [ e^{-i gamma B t/2} e^{i gamma B t/2} ⟨+y| S_z |+y⟩ + e^{-i gamma B t/2} e^{-i gamma B t/2} ⟨+y| S_z |−y⟩ + e^{i gamma B t/2} e^{i gamma B t/2} ⟨−y| S_z |−y⟩ + e^{i gamma B t/2} e^{-i gamma B t/2} ⟨−y| S_z |+y⟩ ] / 2.

Again, the first and third terms are zero because ⟨+y| S_z |+y⟩ and ⟨−y| S_z |−y⟩ are zero.

The cross terms:

Second term: e^{-i gamma B t} ⟨+y| S_z |−y⟩ = e^{-i gamma B t} (ħ/2 )

Fourth term: e^{0} ⟨−y| S_z |+y⟩ = (ħ/2 )

So,

⟨psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)⟩ = [ (ħ/2) e^{-i gamma B t} + (ħ/2) e^{i gamma B t} ] / 2 

= (ħ/4) [ e^{-i gamma B t} + e^{i gamma B t} ]

= (ħ/4) * 2 cos(gamma B t )

= (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t )

So, the expectation value of S_z is (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t ). Thus, the average of mu_z is gamma * (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t ).

Wait, but mu_z is in units of energy times time or something else? I'm getting a bit stuck on the units, but perhaps I should proceed.

The oscillation occurs with angular frequency omega = gamma B.

So, the frequency is omega/(2 pi) = gamma B/(2 pi).

But looking at the options provided, none of them have a denominator involving pi or 2 pi. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, or perhaps the problem is considering the angular frequency as the oscillation frequency.

Wait, the problem says, "the average of the z-component of the particle’s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?"

The oscillation frequency is the number of cycles per second, which is the angular frequency divided by 2 pi.

But according to the options, option B is gamma*B, which would correspond to the angular frequency.

But wait, the problem could have the options in terms of angular frequency. So the answer would be option B, gamma*B.

But another possibility is that when the energy difference is delta E = gamma B ħ, the frequency is delta E / h-bar = gamma B.

Wait, delta E = gamma B ħ → frequency f = delta E / h-bar = gamma B.

So, the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

Thus, the correct answer is option B.


The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\mu = \gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+z$ direction. The field is then switched to point along the $+y$ direction, and the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the magnetic moment, $\langle \mu_z \rangle$, is to be determined.

### Key Analysis

1. **Initial State and Hamiltonian**:  
   Initially, the particle is in the eigenstate of $S_z$, specifically $| \uparrow \rangle_z$. The Hamiltonian before the field change is proportional to $S_z$. After the field is switched to the $+y$ direction, the new Hamiltonian is $H = -\gamma B S_y$. The eigenstates of $S_y$ are $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$, with eigenvalues $\pm \hbar/2$.

2. **State Expansion**:  
   The initial state $| \uparrow \rangle_z$ is expressed in terms of the eigenstates of $S_y$ as:  
   \[
   | \uparrow \rangle_z = \frac{|+y\rangle + |-y\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}.
   \]

3. **Time Evolution**:  
   Under the new Hamiltonian $H = -\gamma B S_y$, the time evolution of the state is:  
   \[
   |\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{e^{-iE_+t/\hbar}|+y\rangle + e^{-iE_-t/\hbar}|-y\rangle}{\sqrt{2}},
   \]  
   where $E_+ = -\gamma B \hbar/2$ and $E_- = \gamma B \hbar/2$. The energy difference is $\Delta E = E_+ - E_- = -\gamma B \hbar$.

4. **Expectation Value of $S_z$**:  
   The expectation value of $S_z$ is computed as:  
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \langle \psi(t) | S_z | \psi(t) \rangle.
   \]  
   Expanding this, the diagonal terms vanish because $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$ are not eigenstates of $S_z$. The cross terms involve $\langle +y | S_z | -y \rangle$ and $\langle -y | S_z | +y \rangle$, which are equal to $\hbar/2$ and $\hbar/2$, respectively. The result simplifies to:  
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t).
   \]

5. **Oscillation Frequency**:  
   The oscillation of $\langle S_z \rangle$ has an angular frequency $\omega = \gamma B$. Since $\mu_z = \gamma S_z$, the oscillation frequency of $\langle \mu_z \rangle$ is the same as that of $\langle S_z \rangle$.

6. **Matching to Options**:  
   The oscillation frequency is $\gamma B$, which corresponds to **Option B**.

### Final Answer
**Answer: B**
