Okay, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and whether it can detect certain stars. Hmm, I need to figure out which of the stars listed would be detectable. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The question says a star is detectable if it achieves a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. So I need to calculate or estimate the S/N for each star and see if it meets this threshold.

Wait, but I don't have all the exact parameters of ESPRESSO. I remember reading that ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph, part of the VLT. It's used for things like radial velocity measurements, right? So its sensitivity must be a key factor here.

I think the S/N depends on a few factors: the brightness of the star (apparent magnitude), the exposure time, the telescope's collecting area, the spectrograph's efficiency, and the noise sources like background. But without detailed specs, maybe I can use some general knowledge or formulas.

The formula for signal-to-noise ratio is something like S/N = (flux * exposure time * efficiency) / sqrt(flux * exposure time * noise^2 + ... ) Hmm, perhaps a simpler approach is needed.

Alternatively, I remember that for a given telescope and instrument, the S/N improves with the square root of the exposure time. But since all the options have the same exposure time (1 hour), the main factors would be the star's brightness (apparent magnitude) and distance.

Wait, wait. Each star's absolute magnitude is given as 15 mag. Absolute magnitude is how bright a star would appear at 10 pc. So I need to calculate their apparent magnitudes based on their distances.

Yes, the formula for apparent magnitude is m = M + 5 + 5 log10(d / 10 pc). Or more accurately, m = M + 5 * log10(d) -5, where d is in parsecs.

So let's calculate each star's apparent magnitude:

a) Canopus: I think Canopus is a very bright star. Wait, Canopus is a first-magnitude star. I think it's about magnitude -0.7 or something. But the question lists it as option a, which I need to check. Wait, no, the options a, c, d, e, f have absolute magnitude 15, but Canopus is a different case. Oh wait, no. Wait the question lists a) Canopus, which I think is a bright star, but the others are stars with abs mag 15 at varying distances.

Wait, the options are a) Canopus, b) Polaris, and c to f are stars with abs mag 15 at different distances.

So I think I need to treat each option separately.

First, Canopus (option a) is a bright star. I remember that Canopus is the brightest star in the constellation Carina and is one of the most luminous stars. It's about magnitude -0.7, right? So that's way brighter than the others. So its apparent magnitude is way below 15.

But what about the other options, like Polaris (b) and the others (c to f). Let me think.

Option b is Polaris. Polaris is the North Star, and its apparent magnitude is around 1.97. So it's much brighter than the abs mag 15 stars at 10 pc, but wait, no. Wait, Polaris is a variable star but I think currently around 2.0 in mag. So again, brighter than the others.

Options c to f are stars with absolute magnitude 15, varying distances. So I need to compute their apparent magnitudes.

So for each star with abs mag 15:

c) 10 pc away: m = 15 + 5 log10(10) -5*1 = 15 +5*(1) -5= 15+5-5=15. So m=15.

Wait, no. Let me get the formula right. The formula is m = M + 5 log10(d) -5, where d is in parsecs.

So for option c, d=10 pc.

m = 15 +5 log10(10) -5 = 15 +5*1 -5 =15+5=20? Wait that can't be. Wait, 10 log10(10) is 1, so 5 *1=5. So 15 +5 -5=15. So m=15.

Wait, that's correct. Because absolute magnitude is defined as apparent magnitude at 10 pc. So at 10 pc, m = M. So for a star at 10 pc with M=15, m=15.

But what about the others.

Option e: d=5 pc.

m =15 +5 log10(5) -5.

log10(5)= ~0.69897. 5 *0.69897= ~3.495.

So m=15 +3.495 -5 = 13.495.

So m ~13.5.

Option f: d=50 pc.

m=15 +5 log10(50) -5.

Log10(50)=1.69897.

5 *1.69897=8.49485.

m=15+8.49485 -5=18.49485.

Option d: d=200 pc.

m=15 +5 log10(200) -5.

log10(200)=2.3010.

5*2.3010=11.505.

m=15 +11.505 -5 = 21.505.

So the apparent magnitudes for the stars are:

a) Canopus: say around m ~0.7 (since brighter is lower magnitude).

b) Polaris: m ~2.0.

c) m=15.

d) m~21.5.

e) m~13.5.

f) m~18.5.

Now, the question is which of these have S/N >=10 per binned pixel in 1 hour.

Assuming that the higher the apparent magnitude, the fainter the star, so lower S/N.

I think the ESPRESSO spectrograph's sensitivity depends on the star's brightness. The fainter the star (higher m), the lower the S/N.

But what is the typical limit for ESPRESSO?

From what I recall, ESPRESSO is designed for high-precision radial velocity measurements, so it's sensitive enough for bright stars. But for very faint stars, maybe not.

Wait, I found a source that says ESPRESSO can reach S/N per pixel of about 100 for G-type stars (like the Sun) at V=10 in 1 hour. But wait, that's when the star is bright. So if that's true, then it's more sensitive than I thought.

Wait, but the stars in the options are much fainter. Let's think: the S/N depends on the flux received. The flux F is proportional to 10^(-0.4*(m - m_ref)), where m_ref is some reference magnitude.

Assuming a reference S/N is known for a certain magnitude, like for a star of m=10, which is brighter than most of these.

But perhaps I should think in terms of how the S/N scales with magnitude. The S/N is proportional to sqrt(F), and F is proportional to 10^(-0.4 m), so S/N is proportional to 10^(-0.2 m) * sqrt(t), where t is exposure time.

Wait, but maybe a better approach is to find the formula for S/N as a function of magnitude. The approximate formula for S/N is:

S/N = 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)) * sqrt(t) * (some constant)

Where m0 is a reference magnitude. For example, if a star of m0 has a certain S/N in time t, then others can be calculated.

But I don't remember the exact numbers. Let me think about the V-band. Let's say that for a V=10 star, S/N is 100 per pixel in 1 hour with ESPRESSO.

Wait, I think ESPRESSO is designed to reach S/N of 100 per pixel for a G2V star (like the Sun) in 10 minutes. Wait, but that's a much shorter time. Alternatively, maybe it's 20 S/N per pixel in 1 second for bright stars. I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look up the formula for S/N for a spectrograph. The signal is the photon count, and the noise is sqrt(signal + background).

Assuming that the background is negligible (which may not be the case), the S/N is sqrt(N_photons).

The number of photons N is proportional to the flux F, which is proportional to 10^(-0.4 m) * t.

So S/N = sqrt( F * t * (efficiency terms) )

But without exact numbers, maybe I can use a rule of thumb. Let's assume that for a certain magnitude, the S/N per pixel drops as the magnitude increases.

If the ESPRESSO can achieve S/N ~10 per pixel for a star at m=15 in 1 hour, then all stars with m<=15 would be detectable. But wait, the options have stars with higher m.

Wait, let's think about the V magnitude. The brighter the star (lower m), the more photons, the higher the S/N.

The question is whether each of the stars can reach at least S/N=10 per binned pixel in 1 hour.

So let's make a list:

Star | Apparent Magnitude (m)
a) Canopus: ~0.7
b) Polaris: ~2.0
c) 15
d) ~21.5
e) ~13.5
f) ~18.5

Assuming that the S/N scales with the flux. Let's say that for a star at m=15, the S/N is 10. Then:

- If a star is brighter (lower m), S/N increases.

- If a star is fainter (higher m), S/N decreases.

Wait, but if m=15 gives S/N=10, then:

m=15: S/N=10.

m=13.5: brighter than 15, so S/N higher than 10. So this star would have S/N=10*(10^(0.4*(15-13.5))) = 10*(10^(0.4*1.5))=10*(10^0.6)=10*3.98~39.8. So that's way above 10.

Similarly, m=10 would have S/N=10*(10^(0.4*(15-10))) = 10*(10^(2))=10*100=1000, which is way higher than needed.

So for the stars:

a) m=0.7: S/N would be 10*(10^(0.4*(15-0.7))) = 10*(10^(0.4*14.3))=10*(10^5.72)= ... that's an enormous number, so S/N way above 10.

b) m=2.0: same approach. 10^(0.4*(15-2))=10^(5.2)= about 1.6e5. So S/N=10*1.6e5=1.6e6, way above 10.

c) m=15: S/N=10.

d) m=21.5: 10^(0.4*(15-21.5))=10^(-0.4*6.5)=10^(-2.6)= ~2.51e-3. So S/N=10*2.51e-3=0.0251, which is way below 10.

e) m=13.5: as before, S/N~ 39.8>10.

f) m=18.5: 10^(-0.4*(18.5-15))=10^(-1.4)= ~0.0398. So S/N=10 *0.0398=0.398 <10.

So for each star:

a) S/N= very high, yes.

b) S/N= very high, yes.

c) S/N=10, yes.

d) S/N=0.025, no.

e) S/N=39.8, yes.

f) S/N=0.398, no.

Wait, but this model is based on the assumption that S/N scales with 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)), where m0 is a reference point where S/N is 10.

Wait, I think I got the scaling wrong.

Wait, the scaling is actually S/N = S/N0 * 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)), where m0 is the reference magnitude. So if m0 is 15 (so S/N0=10), then:

For a star with m=13.5, which is 1.5 magnitudes brighter, the S/N would be 10 * 10^(0.4 * 1.5) = 10*10^0.6 ≈ 10 *3.98=39.8, as before.

Similarly, a star with m=18.5 is 3.5 magnitudes fainter, so S/N=10 *10^(-0.4*3.5)=10*(10^-1.4)=10 * 0.0398≈0.398.

So for each star:

a) Canopus: m=0.7. Brighter than m0=15 by 14.3 mag. So S/N=10 *10^(0.4*14.3)=10 *10^5.72≈10*5.2e5=5.2e6. So yes.

b) Polaris: m=2.0. Brighter than 15 by 13 mag. So S/N=10 *10^(0.4*13)=10 *10^5.2=10*1.58e5=1.58e6. Yes.

c) m=15: S/N=10. Exactly meets the requirement.

d) m=21.5: S/N=10 *10^(-0.4*6.5)=10*10^(-2.6)=10 *0.0251=0.251 <10. So no.

e) m=13.5: S/N=39.8>10. Yes.

f) m=18.5: S/N=0.398<10. No.

So which stars are detectable (S/N >=10)?

a: yes

b: yes

c: yes

e: yes

d: no

f: no

That's four stars: a, b, c, e.

Wait, but wait, I need to count all the options.

Wait, the question lists the options as a) to f). So the correct stars are a, b, c, e. So four stars.

But let me check the options. The options are:

a) Canopus: yes

b) Polaris: yes

c: yes

d: no

e: yes

f: no

So that's 4 stars (a, b, c, e) which meet the S/N>=10.

But wait, the question says "when it is coupled with one of the 8m VLT telescopes".

Wait, does the telescope size affect the S/N? Because a bigger telescope collects more light, leading to higher S/N.

But in this case, the VLT is 8m, so diameter D=8m, so area A=π*(4)^2= ~50 m².

Wait, but the flux received is proportional to (A) * (exposure time) * (efficiency) / (distance squared). Wait, but in our earlier calculation, we already accounted for distance via the apparent magnitude.

Wait, no, because the apparent magnitude already accounts for distance. So the calculation above for m is correct for each star.

Wait, but I think in our initial approach, we've assumed that the apparent magnitude determines the flux, so the telescope size is already accounted for because the apparent magnitude is a measure of flux. So if the VLT is 8m, it's more sensitive than smaller telescopes. But if another setup had a smaller telescope, the S/N would be lower.

But in this problem, the setup is fixed: ESPRESSO on the 8m VLT. So the S/N will depend on the star's apparent magnitude.

So back to the conclusion: a, b, c, e are detectable, d and f are not.

So the stars detectable are a, b, c, e: four stars.

Looking at the options, the options are:

A) 2

B) 5

C) 4

D) 3

So the correct answer would be C) 4, which is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how many of the listed stars are detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph coupled with an 8m VLT telescope, we calculate the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) for each star. A star is considered detectable if the S/N is at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. The apparent magnitude \( m \) of each star is calculated using the formula:

\[
m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5
\]

where \( M \) is the absolute magnitude and \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. The S/N scales with the flux, which depends on the apparent magnitude. Assuming that a star with \( m = 15 \) achieves an S/N of 10, the S/N for other stars can be estimated using:

\[
\text{S/N} = 10 \times 10^{-0.4 \times (m - 15)}
\]

### Calculations for Each Star:
1. **Canopus (a):**  
   Canopus is a very bright star with an apparent magnitude \( m \approx -0.7 \). This is much brighter than \( m = 15 \), resulting in an S/N far exceeding 10.  
   **Detectable.**

2. **Polaris (b):**  
   Polaris has an apparent magnitude \( m \approx 2.0 \), which is brighter than \( m = 15 \). Its S/N also far exceeds 10.  
   **Detectable.**

3. **Star c (10 pc distance):**  
   At 10 pc, the apparent magnitude is \( m = 15 \), which meets the S/N requirement exactly.  
   **Detectable.**

4. **Star d (200 pc distance):**  
   At 200 pc, the apparent magnitude is \( m \approx 21.5 \). This is fainter than \( m = 15 \), resulting in an S/N much lower than 10.  
   **Not detectable.**

5. **Star e (5 pc distance):**  
   At 5 pc, the apparent magnitude is \( m \approx 13.5 \). This is brighter than \( m = 15 \), resulting in an S/N greater than 10.  
   **Detectable.**

6. **Star f (50 pc distance):**  
   At 50 pc, the apparent magnitude is \( m \approx 18.5 \). This is fainter than \( m = 15 \), resulting in an S/N much lower than 10.  
   **Not detectable.**

### Conclusion:
The stars detectable by ESPRESSO are Canopus (a), Polaris (b), Star c, and Star e. This gives a total of **4 detectable stars**.
