Okay, so I've got this problem here about quantum mechanics, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking. 

The state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, so that's a three-dimensional vector. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state vector can be a column vector, and it's usually a unit vector because it represents a probability amplitude. But wait, let me check the length of this vector to see if it's normalized. The elements are -1, 2, and 1. The square of each element is 1, 4, and 1. Adding them up gives 6. Oh, so it's not a unit vector. But wait, the state vector should be normalized. Maybe I should normalize it before proceeding?

Wait, the problem doesn't mention whether the state is normalized. Oh, but in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are always normalized. So maybe I made a mistake here. Let me calculate the norm. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the state is not normalized. Hmm, does that matter for the observable measurement? I think when calculating probabilities, I need to use the normalized state. So perhaps I need to normalize it first.

Wait, the observable is represented by the matrix P, which is a 3x3 matrix. The rows are first (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and third (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So P looks like this:

Row 1: 0, 1/√2, 0
Row 2: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2
Row 3: 0, 1/√2, 0

Wait, but what do I know about this matrix? Observables are Hermitian operators, so I should check if P is Hermitian. Let me see. For a matrix to be Hermitian, it must equal its conjugate transpose. Since all elements here are real, the conjugate transpose is just the transpose. So transposing P would swap elements across the diagonal. Let's see:

Original P:

0 1/√2 0
1/√2 0 1/√2
0 1/√2 0

Transposed P (since it's symmetric):

0 1/√2 0
1/√2 0 1/√2
0 1/√2 0

So P is symmetric, so it's Hermitian. That's good because observables must be Hermitian.

The question is asking for the probability that the measurement of P yields 0. So I need to find the probability that when I measure P, I get 0.

In quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes of a measurement correspond to the eigenvalues of the observable (operator) P. So first, I need to find the eigenvalues of P.

But wait, calculating the eigenvalues of a 3x3 matrix can get a bit complicated, but perhaps there's a pattern or symmetry here. Alternatively, maybe I can diagonalize P, but perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the expectation values and eigenvectors, but no, the question is about the probability of getting 0 as a result.

So let's find the eigenvalues of P. The eigenvalues are the solutions to the equation det(P - λI) = 0.

Let me write the matrix P - λI:

Row 1: -λ, 1/√2, 0
Row 2: 1/√2, -λ, 1/√2
Row 3: 0, 1/√2, -λ

So the determinant of this matrix should be zero.

The determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be calculated as:

-λ * [(-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2)] - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] + 0 * [something]

Wait, perhaps it's easier to expand the determinant properly.

The determinant is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] 
- (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] 
+ 0 * [ ... ] 

Wait, let me correct the expansion. The determinant is calculated as:

a(ei − fh) − b(di − fg) + c(dh − eg), where the matrix is:

[a b c]
[d e f]
[g h i]

So applying this to our P - λI matrix:

a = -λ, b = 1/√2, c = 0
d = 1/√2, e = -λ, f = 1/√2
g = 0, h = 1/√2, i = -λ

So determinant is:

a*(e*i - f*h) - b*(d*i - f*g) + c*(d*h - e*g)

Plugging in:

= (-λ) [ (-λ)*(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ]
- (1/√2) [ (1/√2)*(-λ) - (1/√2)*0 ) ]
+ 0 [ ... ] (which is zero)

Simplify each term:

First term: (-λ)[ (λ^2) - (1/2) ) ] = (-λ)(λ^2 - 1/2) = -λ^3 + (λ * 1/2)

Second term: -(1/√2)[ ( -λ/√2 ) - 0 ) ] = -(1/√2)( -λ/√2 ) = (1/√2)(λ/√2) )= λ/(2)

So putting it all together:

Determinant = (-λ^3 + (λ/2)) + (λ/2) = -λ^3 + (λ/2 + λ/2) ) = -λ^3 + λ.

So the equation is:

-λ^3 + λ = 0 → λ(-λ^2 + 1) = 0 → λ(1 - λ²) = 0.

So the eigenvalues are λ = 0, λ = 1, and λ = -1.

Wait, wait. Wait, no, because 1 - λ^2 is (1-λ)(1+λ), so the solutions are λ=0, λ=1, and λ=-1.

So the possible outcomes when measuring P are 0, 1, and -1.

The question asks for the probability of getting 0.

In quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue (say, 0) is the square of the absolute value of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state.

So I need to find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0, and then compute the inner product of the state vector with each of these eigenvectors. The sum of the squares of the absolute values of these inner products gives the probability.

Alternatively, the probability is the expectation value of the projection onto the eigenspace corresponding to 0.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to find the eigenvectors for λ=0.

So let's find the eigenvectors for P with λ=0.

We have (P - 0I)v = 0 → P v = 0.

So the matrix P is:

0   1/√2   0
1/√2 0   1/√2
0   1/√2   0

We can set up the system of equations:

0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → (1/√2) v2 = 0 → v2 = 0.

Second equation: (1/√2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 → (1/√2)(v1 + v3) = 0 → v1 + v3 = 0 → v3 = -v1.

Third equation: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → same as first equation, v2=0.

So the eigenvectors for λ=0 are all vectors where v2=0 and v3 = -v1. So the eigenvectors are of the form (v1, 0, -v1) where v1 is any scalar.

So an eigenvector can be written as (1, 0, -1), multiplied by a scalar. To make it a unit vector, let's compute its norm. The vector (1,0,-1) has a norm squared of 1^2 +0 + (-1)^2=2, so the unit vector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2).

Wait, but the eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional, so all vectors in that eigenspace are scalar multiples of (1,0,-1).

Wait, but I'm not sure if this is the only eigenvector because sometimes there can be more, but in this case, since the matrix is 3x3 and we found a single eigenvector for λ=0, the eigenspace is one-dimensional.

So the eigenvectors for λ=0 are all vectors along (1, 0, -1), scaled appropriately.

Now, the state vector is given as (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but earlier I noticed that it's not normalized. So let me normalize it first.

The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2=1+4+1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the normalized state vector is ( (-1)/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ).

Wait, but perhaps the problem assumes the state is already normalized. Hmm, but the problem says the state is given by that column matrix, so I think I should proceed with the given state. But when calculating probabilities, the state needs to be normalized. Otherwise, the probabilities won't sum to 1.

Wait, but if it's not normalized, perhaps the observable's measurement probabilities are calculated using the unnormalized state. No, I think in quantum mechanics, the state vector must be normalized; otherwise, the probabilities don't sum to 1. So perhaps the given state is not normalized, but the problem expects us to proceed regardless. Hmm, but that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe I should proceed with the given state without normalization, as perhaps the problem is designed that way. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the probability that a measurement of P yields 0 is the square of the amplitude of the component of the state in the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

Since the eigenspace for 0 is one-dimensional and spanned by the vector (1,0,-1), the probability is the squared inner product of the state vector with this eigenvector, divided by the norm squared of the eigenvector.

But wait, the eigenvector is (1,0,-1), and the state is (-1, 2, 1). So the inner product is (-1)(1) + 2*0 + 1*(-1) = (-1) + 0 + (-1) = -2.

The norm of the eigenvector is sqrt(1^2 +0 + (-1)^2) )= sqrt(2). So the inner product is -2, and the probability is (| -2 |^2 ) / ( (sqrt(2))^2 ) ) = (4) / 2 = 2. But wait, that can't be right because probability can't be greater than 1.

Wait, that's a problem. So I must have made a mistake in this approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should normalize both the state and the eigenvector before taking the inner product. Let's see.

The normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

The given state is (-1, 2, 1), which has a norm of sqrt(6), so the normalized state is (-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6)).

So the inner product between the state and the eigenvector is:

[ (-1/sqrt(6)) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) ] + [ (2/sqrt(6)) * 0 ] + [ (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1/sqrt(2)) ) ]

Which is (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ) + 0 + (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) )

= [ (-1) -1 ] / (sqrt(12)) )

= (-2) / (2*sqrt(3)) )

= (-1)/sqrt(3).

The absolute value squared is (1/3).

So the probability is 1/3.

Wait, that makes sense. So the probability of measuring 0 is 1/3.

Alternatively, maybe there's a simpler way, like using the expectation value, but I think the way I did it is correct.

Wait, another way: The observable P can be written as a matrix, and the expected value is the expectation value of P in the given state. But the question is about the probability of getting 0, not the expectation.

Hmm, perhaps another approach is to compute the projection of the state onto the eigenspace of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0, then take the square of the norm of that projection.

But in any case, I think the correct probability is 1/3.

Looking at the options, option C is 1/3, so that should be the answer.

To determine the probability of measuring the observable \( P \) and obtaining the eigenvalue \( 0 \), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( P \)
The observable \( P \) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

To find the eigenvalues, solve \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \). The characteristic equation is:

\[
-\lambda^3 + \lambda = 0 \implies \lambda(-\lambda^2 + 1) = 0.
\]

Thus, the eigenvalues are \( \lambda = 0, 1, -1 \).

### Step 2: Eigenvectors for \( \lambda = 0 \)
For \( \lambda = 0 \), solve \( P \mathbf{v} = 0 \). The system of equations yields:

\[
\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v_2 = 0, \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v_1 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v_3 = 0, \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v_2 = 0.
\end{cases}
\]

From the first and third equations, \( v_2 = 0 \). From the second equation, \( v_3 = -v_1 \). Thus, the eigenvectors are of the form:

\[
\mathbf{v} = (v_1, 0, -v_1).
\]

A normalized eigenvector is:

\[
\mathbf{v}_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: State Vector and Normalization
The given state vector is:

\[
\mathbf{s} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
-1 \\
2 \\
1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The norm of \( \mathbf{s} \) is:

\[
\|\mathbf{s}\| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{1 + 4 + 1} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

The normalized state vector is:

\[
\mathbf{s}_{\text{normalized}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} 
\begin{bmatrix}
-1 \\
2 \\
1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 4: Probability of Measuring \( 0 \)
The probability of measuring \( 0 \) is the square of the absolute value of the projection of \( \mathbf{s}_{\text{normalized}} \) onto the eigenspace of \( \lambda = 0 \). The projection is:

\[
\langle \mathbf{v}_0 | \mathbf{s}_{\text{normalized}} \rangle = 
\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \right)
\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \right).
\]

Compute the inner product:

\[
\langle \mathbf{v}_0 | \mathbf{s}_{\text{normalized}} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \cdot [ (-1)(1) + (2)(0) + (1)(-1) ] = \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} \cdot (-2) = -\frac{2}{2\sqrt{3}} = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The probability is the square of the absolute value:

\[
P(0) = \left| -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probability of measuring \( 0 \) is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
