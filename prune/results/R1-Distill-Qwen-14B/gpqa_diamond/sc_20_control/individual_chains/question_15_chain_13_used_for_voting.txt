Okay, so I've got this astronomy question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. But wait, how do I determine which planet is more likely to transit? Let me think.

The question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but their orbital periods are different. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Also, their host stars have the same radius, but different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. Both have circular orbits.

I recall that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the size of the orbit. The formula for the transit probability is something like R_p / (2R_s) multiplied by (a / R_s), where R_p is planet radius, R_s is star radius, and a is orbital distance. Wait, or was it a different formula? Alternatively, I think the probability P is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (a/(R_s))? Or maybe it's the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the sum of the star's radius and the planet's orbital distance. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the transit probability, P, is given by the formula P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (R_s + R_p) / a ), but I might be mixing things up. Alternatively, another source I remember says that the transit probability is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (a / (R_s + R_p)). Wait, no, maybe it's more about the alignment. Oh right, the probability that the Earth's line of sight intersects the orbital plane is given by (R * sin(i)) / a, where i is the inclination. But wait, for random orientations, the probability depends on the ratio between the size of the star and the planet's orbital distance.

Wait, maybe the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by (R_s / a), but I'm not sure. Or is it (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by (a / R_s), because as a increases, the probability decreases. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability is the area of the star as seen from Earth, and the planet's path across that area. So the probability is the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. Wait that's not right because the planet can only block the star if it's in the right orbital plane. So actually, the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the probability that the planet's orbit is aligned edge-on enough for the transit to happen.

Wait, no, the main factor is the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance. Because for a planet to transit, the orbital distance must be such that the planet's path passes in front of the star. So the transit probability is roughly (R_s / a)^2, but wait, that doesn't make sense because if a is larger, the probability would be smaller.

Wait, I think the transit probability P is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 * (sin i), where i is the inclination. But for random i, the average sin i is 1/2. So the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1/2). But wait, that's just the geometric probability for the planet to pass in front, regardless of other factors. But in our case, we know the orbital periods and the star's mass, so maybe we can find the orbital distance a using Kepler's third law.

Oh right! Because both planets have been detected via the radial velocity method, which gives their minimum mass, but we can use Kepler's law to find the orbital distance. Kepler's third law says that (a^3)/(T^2) = G(M_s)/(4π²), where M_s is the mass of the star, T is the orbital period, and G is the gravitational constant.

So for each planet, we can find a in terms of the star's mass and T. Since Planet_1's period is T1 = T2/3 (because it's three times shorter), we can write a1^3 = [G(M1) T1²]/(4π²) and a2^3 = [G(M2) T2²]/(4π²).

Given that M1 (Planet_1's host star) is twice M2 (Planet_2's host star), because M1 = 2*M2.

So substituting T1 = T2/3 and M1 = 2*M2 into the equation for a1:

a1^3 = G*(2 M2) * (T2/3)^2 / (4π²)
= G*M2*(T2^2) * (2) * (1/9) / (4π²)
= (2/9) * [G*M2*T2^2/(4π²)]
But [G*M2*T2^2/(4π²)] is a2^3, so a1^3 = (2/9) a2^3.

Taking cube roots, a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3). Let's compute 2/9: that's approximately 0.222. The cube root of 0.222 is about 0.6, because 0.6^3 is 0.216. So a1 is roughly 0.6 times a2. So Planet_1 is much closer to its star than Planet_2.

Now, the transit probability depends on the ratio R_p / a, where R_p is planet radius, and a is the orbital distance (semi-major axis). But wait, the actual transit probability is more accurately given by (R_p/R_s)² * (R_s/a) * (sqrt(1 - (R_s/a)^2)) or something along those lines? Or perhaps it's just (R_p / a)^2, but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, I think the probability for a transit is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a), but no, that doesn't seem dimensionally correct. Alternatively, the transit probability is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (something involving the orbit). Wait, maybe the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a / R_s), but wait, no, that would give units of length, which doesn't make sense for a probability.

Wait, perhaps the transit probability is given by (R_p / a)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a), but I'm not confident. Alternatively, I've read that the probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance, times the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius squared. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability is the ratio of the area of the planet's disk to the area of the star's disk, multiplied by the probability that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it passes in front. But the alignment factor is about (R_s / a), because if the orbit is much larger than the star, the chance of alignment is lower.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the transit probability P is:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a)

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, some sources say that the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (a/(R_s + R_p)), but since R_p << R_s, that approximates to (R_p^2 / R_s^2) * (a/R_s). So P ≈ (R_p^2 a) / R_s^3.

Wait, but in the question, the planet radii aren't given. Oh wait, does the problem give the planet radii? Let me check the question again.

Wait, the question says: "they know the masses and radii of the host stars." So the host stars have known radii, but the planet radii aren't mentioned. Hmm. Wait, the planets are Earth-like, so presumably similar in size to Earth. But without knowing their exact radii, maybe we can assume they're the same? Or does the transit probability depend on the planet's radius?

Wait, but the options don't mention R_p, so perhaps the transit probability is determined by the star's radius and the planet's orbital distance. Because the other factors (like planet radius) are the same for both.

Wait, another thought: since both are Earth-like, perhaps their radii are the same. So R_p1 = R_p2. Therefore, the transit probability would be proportional to (R_p)^2 / a^2, because P ∝ (R_p/R_s)^2 * (R_s / a) → (R_p^2 R_s) / (R_s^2 a) ) = (R_p^2)/(R_s a).

Wait, that can't be right because then a longer period (i.e., a larger a) would lead to a lower probability. Hmm, but earlier I found that a1 is about 0.6 a2. So a1 is smaller, which would mean a higher probability.

So P ∝ (R_p^2) / (a * R_s).

Wait, but wait, both host stars have the same radius, R_s. So R_s1 = R_s2 = R_s. So P ∝ 1/(a), because R_p is the same for both. So the planet with a smaller a has a higher probability.

Wait, but if P is proportional to (R_p^2) / (a R_s), and R_s is same for both, and R_p is same, then P is inversely proportional to a.

So Planet_1 has a1 = 0.6 a2. So P1 = (1/a1), and P2 = (1/a2). Thus, P1 = (1/(0.6 a2)) = (1/0.6) (1/a2) ≈ 1.666... * (1/a2) = 1.666 * P2. So P1 ≈ 1.666 times higher than P2.

So the probability for Planet_1 is higher. So the researchers should prefer Planet_1.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. 1.65 is about 5/3, which is approximately 1.666... So that fits.

Wait, but wait. Let me re-express that.

Earlier, I found a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3). Let me compute that accurately.

So 2/9 is approximately 0.2222. The cube root of 0.2222 is equal to (0.2222)^(1/3). Let me compute that. 0.2222 is about 2/9.

What's 0.2222^(1/3)?

Well, 0.2222 is 2/9. So the cube root of (2/9) = (2)^(1/3) / (9)^(1/3) = (cube root of 2) / (cube root of 9). Cube root of 2 is about 1.26, cube root of 9 is about 2.08. So 1.26 / 2.08 ≈ 0.605. So a1 = a2 * 0.605.

So a1 ≈ 0.605 a2.

So P is inversely proportional to a (if P ∝ 1/a), then P1 = (1/a1) = (1/(0.605 a2)) ≈ 1.6529 * (1/a2) = approximately 1.65 times higher than P2.

Which matches option C: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Wait, but I thought earlier the transit probability formula may involve (R_p/R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s/a), but if R_p is same for both, and R_s same, then P ∝ 1/a.

Alternatively, if the formula is (R_p/(2 R_s))^2 * (R_s/a), then P would be proportional to (1/a) as well. So same conclusion.

So the correct answer is option C.

To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula. The transit probability \( P \) is proportional to:

\[
P \propto \left(\frac{R_p}{R_s}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{R_s}{a}
\]

where \( R_p \) is the planet's radius, \( R_s \) is the star's radius, and \( a \) is the orbital distance. Since both planets are Earth-like, their radii \( R_p \) are assumed to be the same, and the host stars have the same radius \( R_s \). Thus, the transit probability simplifies to being inversely proportional to the orbital distance \( a \):

\[
P \propto \frac{1}{a}
\]

Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \( a \) can be determined from the orbital period \( T \) and the star's mass \( M_s \). For a circular orbit, Kepler's law is:

\[
a^3 \propto M_s T^2
\]

Given that Planet_1's orbital period \( T_1 \) is three times shorter than Planet_2's (\( T_1 = T_2 / 3 \)) and the star hosting Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star (\( M_1 = 2 M_2 \)), we calculate the ratio of their semi-major axes:

\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{M_1 T_1^2}{M_2 T_2^2} = \frac{(2 M_2) (T_2 / 3)^2}{M_2 T_2^2} = \frac{2}{9}
\]

Taking the cube root:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.605
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.605 a_2 \). Since the transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), the probability for Planet_1 is:

\[
P_1 \propto \frac{1}{a_1} \approx \frac{1}{0.605 a_2} \approx 1.65 \cdot \frac{1}{a_2} = 1.65 P_2
\]

This means Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should prefer observing Planet_1.

**Analysis of Options:**

- **Option A:** Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred; Planet_1 has a higher transit probability.
- **Option B:** Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred, and the probability difference is not 1.5 times.
- **Option C:** Correct. Planet_1 is preferred due to its approximately 1.65 times higher transit probability.
- **Option D:** Incorrect. The probability difference is not 2.7 times.

a1^3 = G*(2 M2) * (T2/3)^2 / (4π²)
= G*M2*(T2^2) * (2) * (1/9) / (4π²)
= (2/9) * [G*M2*T2^2/(4π²)]
But [G*M2*T2^2/(4π²)] is a2^3, so a1^3 = (2/9) a2^3.

Taking cube roots, a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3). Let's compute 2/9: that's approximately 0.222. The cube root of 0.222 is about 0.6, because 0.6^3 is 0.216. So a1 is roughly 0.6 times a2. So Planet_1 is much closer to its star than Planet_2.

So Planet_1 has a1 = 0.6 a2. So P1 = (1/a1), and P2 = (1/a2). Thus, P1 = (1/(0.6 a2)) = (1/0.6) (1/a2) ≈ 1.666... * (1/a2) = 1.666 * P2. So P1 ≈ 1.666 times higher than P2.

So the probability for Planet_1 is higher. So the researchers should prefer Planet_1.

Well, 0.2222 is 2/9. So the cube root of (2/9) = (2)^(1/3) / (9)^(1/3) = (cube root of 2) / (cube root of 9). Cube root of 2 is about 1.26, cube root of 9 is about 2.08. So 1.26 / 2.08 ≈ 0.605. So a1 = a2 * 0.605.

So a1 ≈ 0.605 a2.

So P is inversely proportional to a (if P ∝ 1/a), then P1 = (1/a1) = (1/(0.605 a2)) ≈ 1.6529 * (1/a2) = approximately 1.65 times higher than P2.

Which matches option C: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Wait, but I thought earlier the transit probability formula may involve (R_p/R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s/a), but if R_p is same for both, and R_s same, then P ∝ 1/a.

Alternatively, if the formula is (R_p/(2 R_s))^2 * (R_s/a), then P would be proportional to (1/a) as well. So same conclusion.

So the correct answer is option C.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula. The transit probability \( P \) is proportional to:

\[
P \propto \left(\frac{R_p}{R_s}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{R_s}{a}
\]

where \( R_p \) is the planet's radius, \( R_s \) is the star's radius, and \( a \) is the orbital distance. Since both planets are Earth-like, their radii \( R_p \) are assumed to be the same, and the host stars have the same radius \( R_s \). Thus, the transit probability simplifies to being inversely proportional to the orbital distance \( a \):

\[
P \propto \frac{1}{a}
\]

Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \( a \) can be determined from the orbital period \( T \) and the star's mass \( M_s \). For a circular orbit, Kepler's law is:

\[
a^3 \propto M_s T^2
\]

Given that Planet_1's orbital period \( T_1 \) is three times shorter than Planet_2's (\( T_1 = T_2 / 3 \)) and the star hosting Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star (\( M_1 = 2 M_2 \)), we calculate the ratio of their semi-major axes:

\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{M_1 T_1^2}{M_2 T_2^2} = \frac{(2 M_2) (T_2 / 3)^2}{M_2 T_2^2} = \frac{2}{9}
\]

Taking the cube root:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.605
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.605 a_2 \). Since the transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), the probability for Planet_1 is:

\[
P_1 \propto \frac{1}{a_1} \approx \frac{1}{0.605 a_2} \approx 1.65 \cdot \frac{1}{a_2} = 1.65 P_2
\]

This means Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should prefer observing Planet_1.

**Analysis of Options:**

- **Option A:** Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred; Planet_1 has a higher transit probability.
- **Option B:** Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred, and the probability difference is not 1.5 times.
- **Option C:** Correct. Planet_1 is preferred due to its approximately 1.65 times higher transit probability.
- **Option D:** Incorrect. The probability difference is not 2.7 times.

Answer: C
