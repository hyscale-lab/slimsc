Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which structure corresponds to the spectral data given. Let's see, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think this through step by step.

The problem says the molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 with 100%, and another peak at 158 (32%). Hmm, so the molecular weight is around 156, but there's a peak 2 units higher. That might suggest a chlorine isotope. Chlorine has an atomic weight of about 35, but about 32% of the molecules have a chlorine-35? Wait, no. Wait, the molecular ion is at 156, and the other is 158. So the difference is 2. Since Cl has two common isotopes, 35Cl and 37Cl, which have a natural abundance of about 75% and 25%, respectively. So when you have a molecule with one Cl, the molecular ion would split into peaks at m/z 156 (for Cl-35) and 158 (Cl-37). The ratio should be 3:1 because 75% and 25%, but wait, the data says 100% at 156 and 32% at 158. Wait, 32% is roughly 1/3 of 100, but that doesn't match exactly. Wait, let me calculate: if the Cl is in the molecule, the M peak would be Cl-35, and the M+2 would be Cl-37. So the ratio is (75%)/(25%) = 3:1. So the M+2 peak should be 25%, but here it's 32%. Wait, that's a bit higher than expected. Maybe there are two Cl atoms? Because then the M would be 156 (with two Cl-35), and M+2 would be two Cl-37, which would be (37*2 -35*2)=4, so the M+4 peak would be higher. But in the data, the M+2 is 158, which is +2 from 156. So that suggests only one Cl atom. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something else. Alternatively, maybe the molecular formula has an even number of nitrogen atoms, which affects the mass. Alternatively, maybe it's a double bond or something else. Alternatively, maybe the molecular ion is at 156, and the M+2 is due to something like sulfur, but I don't think that's relevant here.

Wait, maybe the molecular formula has a Cl. Let's think about the possible options. The options given are A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid. C) Phenyl chloroformate. D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid.

So each has a Cl. Let's think about their molecular formulas.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. The formula would be C7H5ClO2. Let's calculate the molecular weight: C is 12*7=84, H is 5*1=5, Cl is about 35, O is 16*2=32. 84+5=89; 89+35=124; 124+32=156. So molecular weight is 156. So the molecular ion is 156. But then M+2 would be 158, which would be due to Cl-37. So the ratio of M to M+2 should be about 3:1, as Cl-35 is 75% and Cl-37 is 25%. So 100% M (156) and 32% M+2 (158) is a bit confusing because 25% would be expected. Wait, 32% is roughly 1/3, which is about 33.3%. Hmm, maybe the natural abundance is a bit different, or perhaps there's another factor. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has more than one Cl, but in the options, only one Cl is present in each option. So perhaps another explanation is needed. Maybe the M is 156, but I'm not getting the ratios right. Alternatively, perhaps the M+2 is not due to Cl. Could it be something else? Like maybe a doublet due to something else, but I can't think of anything else that gives +2. Let's proceed and see.

Next, the IR data: broad peak from 3500-2700 cm-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H or N-H stretches. The region is 3500-2700, which is a bit broad. O-H stretch is usually broad and around 3200-3600. So maybe an acidic O-H, like in a carboxylic acid or phenol. Also, a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong peak, which could be a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So 1720 is typical for a carbonyl in a ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. But wait, a carboxylic acid's carbonyl is usually around 1700 cm-1, but sometimes a bit higher. Alternatively, an ester or amide. Let me think: aliphatic ketones around 1715, maybe. Carboxylic acids around 1700 but maybe a bit higher if deprotonated (like in the solid state, where it can be 1720). Alternatively, maybe an aldehyde, which is around 1720. But aldehydes have a strong peak around 2800-2700 cm-1 for the C-H stretch as well. Hmm.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H) – that's a very downfield proton, probably an aldehyde proton or a carboxylic acid -OH proton. But the integration is 1H. Wait, but carboxylic acid protons are usually broad, but in the NMR they can sometimes appear as broad singlets. However, in the IR, the broad peak could be the O-H from a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, an aldehyde proton is usually around 9-10 ppm, but sometimes higher. Wait, in this case, the proton is at 11 ppm, which is a bit high for an aldehyde. Alternatively, maybe it's a phenolic O-H, but phenolic O-H protons are usually around 5-7 ppm, but in D2O exchange, they can sometimes appear downfield. Hmm, perhaps it's a carboxylic acid proton. Alternatively, looking for other possibilities.

Looking at the other NMR signals: 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because two doublets with the same integration (each 2H) suggests that the protons are in a para arrangement. So maybe two substituents on the benzene ring, each with two equivalent protons. For example, in benzoic acid derivatives, like para-substituted ones.

Let me think about each option:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. That would be o-chlorobenzaldehyde with a hydroxyl group. Wait, structure is Cl on position 3, OH on position 2, and aldehyde on position 1. Wait, that would make it 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. So the structure would have three substituents on the ring. But would the NMR show a para arrangement? No, because if substituents are meta or ortho, the coupling would be different. Alternatively, maybe the aromatic protons are split into two doublets, but it's more likely to be a 1,2,3-trisubstituted ring, which could complicate the NMR. Alternatively, perhaps in this structure, the ring has two substituents: a Cl and an aldehyde group, but wait, also a hydroxyl group. Hmm, but the NMR shows four protons in two doublets, which suggests a para substitution pattern. So perhaps the ring has two substituents: Cl and another group. Let me think about each option.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure would be Cl on position 4, and a COOH group on position 1. So the ring would have substituents at positions 1 and 4. The aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6. Wait, but in benzoic acid, the COOH is at position 1 (let's say), and Cl at position 4. So the ring would have protons in positions 2,3,5,6. For 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the ring would have two substituents in para positions. Then the aromatic protons would be in two sets of doublets: perhaps the two protons adjacent to COOH (positions 2 and 6) and the two adjacent to Cl (positions 3 and 5). Wait, but in benzoic acid, the protons ortho to COOH are deshielded and typically appear downfield. Let me think: in benzoic acid, the ortho protons (2 and 6) are usually as a pair, and the meta (3 and 5) as another. But in the NMR data, the peaks are at 8.02 (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). If the substituents are in para positions, then the ortho protons would be a doublet each. But wait, in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents are at positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). So the aromatic protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. Each pair (2 and 6) are ortho to COOH, and (3 and 5) are ortho to Cl. So perhaps the 2 and 6 protons are each split into a doublet, but maybe they are equivalent, leading to a doublet of doublets? Or perhaps each is a doublet, but combined into a multiplet. Alternatively, perhaps the 2 and 6 are more deshielded and appear as a higher ppm peak, and the 3 and 5 as a lower ppm.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Structure would be Cl-CO-O-Ph. Wait, phenyl chloroformate is OCl-CO-Ph? Wait, chloroformate is Cl-CO-O- (as an ester). So, the structure would be O=C(OCl)Ph? No, wait. Let me think. Chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-R, so for phenyl, it's Cl-CO-O-Ph. So the structure is Cl-C(O)O-Ph. So the aromatic ring is attached to the ester group (Cl-CO-O-). So in that case, the aromatic ring would have substituents like an ester group. The ring would have an OCOCl substituent. Now, in this case, the aromatic protons would be ortho, meta, and para to the ester group. But wait, Cl is part of the ester group, so the substituent is OCOCl on the benzene ring. So the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group, which would deshield the aromatic protons. The aromatic protons would be in a certain pattern. But in the NMR, we have two doublets each of 2H. So that would suggest that the ring has two substituents in the para positions, with the other two protons each as a doublet. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is in the para position, leading to two sets of protons.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure would have Cl on position 2 and COOH on position 1. Then, the ring has substituents at positions 1 and 2. The aromatic protons would be in positions 3,4,5,6. But wait, I think in that case, the aromatic protons would not be in a para arrangement. Alternatively, maybe the ring would have substituents in ortho positions, leading to different coupling patterns.

So, the NMR shows two doublets with 2H each, which suggests that the aromatic ring has two sets of equivalent protons, each as a doublet. A common scenario is a para-substituted benzene, where two substituents are opposite each other, leaving the other four protons in two sets of equivalent doublets.

Wait, let's think about 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The COOH is at position 1, Cl at position 4. Then, the aromatic protons are at positions 2,3,5,6. The protons at positions 2 and 6 are ortho to COOH, and 3 and 5 are ortho to Cl. So in the NMR, these would be two sets. The protons ortho to COOH (2 and 6) are typically deshielded and appear downfield. The H at 8.02 ppm could be these, and the 7.72 could be the H ortho to Cl. How does that match?

In benzoic acid, the ortho protons (to COOH) are usually around 7.5-8.5 ppm, I think. Let's say, for example, in benzoic acid, the ortho protons are at around 7.5 ppm or higher. So if the ring has Cl at para position, the ortho protons to Cl would be in the same region but perhaps a bit upfield because Cl is an electron-withdrawing group.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the NMR shifts. Ortho to COOH (a strong EWG), so the protons would be deshielded and appear around 8.0-8.5 ppm. Ortho to Cl (which is also EWG but less so than COOH?), those protons would be more shielded, maybe around 7.5-7.8 ppm.

In the given NMR data, the peaks are at 8.02 (d,2H) and 7.72 (d,2H). So the 8.02 is more downfield, which likely corresponds to the ortho protons to COOH. The 7.72 is a bit upfield, which could correspond to the ortho protons to Cl. So that matches with 4-chlorobenzoic acid (Option B).

Let me check the other options.

Option A is 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. The structure would have Cl on position 3, OH on position 2, and aldehyde on position 1. So the ring would have three substituents. The aromatic protons would be split into more complex patterns, perhaps with more than two peaks. The NMR data here has only two aromatic doublets, so maybe this is less likely.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. The structure is O=C(OCl)Ph. So the substituent is an ester group, OCOCl attached to the benzene. The aromatic protons would be split into possibly two doublets if the substituent is para. But in that case, the substituent is in one position, so the protons would be in ortho, meta, and para positions. Wait, no, if the substituent is in one position, the ring would have substituent at position 1, and the other positions. So the protons would be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. But wait, in this case, the substituent is at position 1, and the other positions are either ortho (2,6), meta (3,5), and para (4). Wait, but para would be position 4. So the substituent is at position 1. Then, the protons at 2 and 6 (ortho to substituent) would be a doublet, as would the ones at 3 and 5 (meta). So the NMR would show perhaps two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That's possible. So the NMR data could fit option C too. Hmm, but wait, the IR data. Let's think.

The IR has a peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is a strong sharp peak. For phenyl chloroformate, the carbonyl would be from the ester group. Ester carbonyls usually show up around 1720-1750 cm^-1, so that fits. The broad peak in IR is from 3500-2700 cm^-1. That's a bit unusual. For phenyl chloroformate, is there an O-H stretch? No, unless it's an acidic hydrogen elsewhere. Wait, phenyl chloroformate is an ester, so unless there's a hydroxyl group elsewhere, the broad peak might not make sense. Alternatively, the broad peak could be from an aliphatic O-H, but in this case, the structure doesn't have a hydroxyl group. So the IR doesn't fit with option C, because where would the broad peak come from? Unless I'm missing something.

Wait, the IR shows a broad peak in 3500-2700 cm^-1. That's a region where O-H and N-H stretches occur. So if the molecule has an -OH group, that would explain it. So in option C, phenyl chloroformate doesn't have an -OH group. So the IR would have to show a peak from something else. The other possibility is that the broad peak is from an aldehyde proton (C-H), but aldehydes have sharp peaks around 2800 cm^-1. Alternatively, maybe it's an amide, but none of the options are amides.

Wait, let's re-examine the IR. The broad peak is from 3500-2700, which is a wide range. Maybe it's an O-H stretch. So the molecule must have an -OH group. So option C can't be, because it doesn't have an -OH. Let's check the other options.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure would have Cl at position 2 and COOH at position 1. So the ring has substituents at 1 and 2, which are adjacent. The aromatic protons would be at positions 3,4,5,6. So the protons at 3 and 5 are adjacent to Cl, and 4 and 6 are adjacent to COOH. So the NMR would show the protons ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6? Wait, no, COOH is at 1. So the ortho positions are 2 and 6. But in this structure, position 2 has Cl. So the ortho positions to COOH are 2 and 6. But position 2 is Cl, so the ortho proton would be at position 6. Wait, no, in benzoic acid, the substituent is at position 1, so positions 2 and 6 are ortho to COOH. But in this case, position 2 is Cl, so the ortho protons would be only at position 6. Wait, that can't be right because then there's only one proton, but in the NMR, the peaks are 2H each. So perhaps this structure doesn't fit the NMR data.

So, going back, the molecular ion is 156. Let's calculate the molecular weight for each option.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Molecular formula is C7H5ClO2.

C:7 *12=84, H:5=5, Cl:35.5, O:2*16=32. So total is 84 +5 +35.5 +32 = 156.5. Wait, but the molecular ion is at 156. Hmm, that's a problem because the actual molecular weight is around 156.5, which would make the molecular ion at 156 (if we're considering exact masses). Wait, but how does that work? Alternatively, perhaps the exact mass is 156.5. So the molecular ion would be at m/z 156.5, but mass spectrometry often uses nominal mass. So for the purpose of the problem, the molecular ion is at 156. So that should be okay.

So, looking back, the IR broad peak would be from the carboxylic acid's O-H. The strong peak at 1720 cm^-1 is from the C=O of the carboxylic acid. The NMR shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm, which would be the -OH proton of the carboxylic acid, which is usually a broad peak, but in the NMR it's a singlet. Wait, but carboxylic acid protons are usually broad, but sometimes in the solid state or if the solution is concentrated, they can appear as sharp singlets. Alternatively, maybe it's an exchange process that's causing it to be a singlet, but that's a bit unclear.

The aromatic protons: in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the ring has COOH at position 1 and Cl at position 4. The protons at positions 2 and 6 are ortho to COOH (which is a strong EWG) and would be deshielded, appearing downfield, like around 8.0 ppm. The protons at positions 3 and 5 are ortho to Cl, which is a weaker EWG, so they would be slightly less downfield, maybe around 7.7 ppm. Each set is a doublet because they couple with their adjacent protons. So the NMR data matches this.

So, the IR has a broad O-H stretch (carboxylic acid) and a strong C=O at 1720. The NMR has the -OH as a singlet at 11 ppm, which would be the carboxylic acid proton. The aromatic protons are two doublets, which fits the 4-chlorobenzoic acid structure.

What about the mass spectrum? The molecular ion is at 156 (100%), and 158 (32%). Since the molecule has one Cl atom, the M and M+2 peaks are due to the two chlorine isotopes. As earlier, Cl-35 is 75% and Cl-37 is 25%. So the ratio M:M+2 should be 3:1, which is 75% and 25%. But the data shows 100% for M and 32% for M+2. Wait, that doesn't add up. 100% +32% would be 132%, which isn't possible. Oh wait, no, the molecular ion itself should be 100%, and the M+2 would be a relative intensity. So if M is 100%, M+2 is 32%, which is roughly 1/3 of M. That's inconsistent with Cl's 3:1 ratio. Hmm, that's a problem. Because if the molecule has one Cl, the M is Cl-35 (75%) and M+2 is Cl-37 (25%). So the ratio would be M:M+2 = 3:1, but here M is 100%, so M+2 should be about 25%, but it's 32%. That's a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula includes something else, like a double bond or another factor affecting the mass. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has two Cl atoms. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, only option C (phenyl chloroformate) has a Cl in the structure. Wait, no, all the options have one Cl. Let me check each:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Cl in benzene ring.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Cl in ring.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Cl in the ester group as OCl.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Cl in ring.

So each has only one Cl. So the ratio of M:M+2 should be 3:1, but the data shows 32% for M+2, which is higher than 25%. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. But perhaps the natural abundance is slightly different? Or maybe it's not chlorine, but another element with a similar mass. Alternatively, maybe it's not a Cl in the molecule. Wait, but all options have Cl, so the M+2 must be due to Cl. 32% is about 1/3, which is roughly 3:1, but 32% is 1/3.25, which is close to 3:1 (3/4 is 75% for M, 25% for M+2). Wait, 32% is approximately 1/3, which would be 33.3%. 25% is 0.25, so 32% is 0.32. That's 32/75 is about 0.426, which is not matching. Hmm, perhaps the calculation is considering the exact mass. Let me compute the exact mass of the molecular ion.

The molecular formula for option B is C7H5ClO2. The exact mass would be:

Carbon: 7 *12.01 = 84.07

Hydrogen:5 *1.008 =5.04

Cl:34.97 (mass of Cl-35)

O:2 *16.00=32.00

Sum: 84.07 +5.04 = 89.11; 89.11 +34.97=124.08; 124.08 +32.00=156.08.

So the molecular ion would be at 156.08. The M+2 peak is 158.08. The ratio would depend on the Cl isotope abundance.

Cl-35 is 75%, so the M peak (Cl-35) is 75%, and M+2 (Cl-37) is 25%. So the M peak is 156 (75%), and M+2 is 158 (25%). But in the data, M is 100%, M+2 is 32%. That's a ratio of M:M+2 = 100:32, which is 3.125:1, not 3:1. So that's a bit off. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula is C7H5ClO2. Let me compute the exact mass:

C:7 *12.01=84.07

H:5 *1.008=5.04

Cl:34.96885 (Cl-35)

O:2*15.999=31.998

Total exact mass: 84.07 +5.04=89.11; +34.96885=124.079; +31.998=156.077.

So the exact mass is approximately 156.077, so M is at 156.08. The M+2 would be 158.077, but wait, adding 2 mass units would take it to 158.077 (156.077 +2=158.077). But the M+2 is 158. So the peak is at 158, which is 2 mass units higher.

So the ratio of M:M+2 is 75% (M) and 25% (M+2), but the data shows 100% and 32%. That suggests that perhaps the molecule has more than one Cl. Wait, but all the options have only one Cl. So this is a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula is different. Let me think about the molecular weight. The molecular ion is at 156. Let's consider the molecular formula for each option:

Option B: C7H5ClO2. Molecular weight: 12*7=84, 5=5, 35.5=35.5, 16*2=32. 84+5=89 +35.5=124.5 +32=156.5. So exact mass is 156.08, as before.

Wait, but in the data, the molecular ion is at 156, which would correspond to the exact mass of 156.08. So that's correct. But the M+2 is at 158, which is 2 mass units higher. So, the M+2 would be 158.08? No, because M is 156.08, M+2 is 158.08. But the presence of Cl-37 would cause the M+2 peak. So the ratio of M:M+2 should be 75:25, which is 3:1. But in the data, it's 100:32, which is higher than 3:1.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecular ion is not the M peak but another ion. Wait, but the question says the molecular ion is at 156, so that's the M peak.

Hmm, maybe the mistake is that I thought the M peak is Cl-35, but perhaps the M peak is Cl-37. That would invert the ratio. But if the M peak were Cl-37 (35%), then the M+2 would be Cl-35 (75% of M+2). But that doesn't make sense, because the M peak should be the most abundant.

Wait, perhaps the data is presented as the intensity of the molecular ions, not considering that M+2 is a separate peak. The problem states the molecular ion is at 156 (100%), and another peak at 158 (32%). So 156 is 100%, 158 is 32%. So 158 is 32% of 156. So the ratio is M+2/M = 0.32. Which would correspond to (25%) / (75%) ) = 0.333. So 0.32 is close to that. So perhaps the data is accurate enough, considering possible experimental variations.

So the mass data seems to fit option B, considering possible experimental variations in the ratio.

Putting it all together: the IR has a broad O-H (carboxylic acid), strong C=O at 1720. The NMR shows a singlet at 11 ppm (carboxylic acid proton), and two doublets in the aromatic region (para substitution). The mass data fits with one Cl, and the ratio matches approximately with Cl's isotope pattern.

So the correct answer is option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To identify the unknown compound, the provided spectral data was analyzed as follows:

### Mass Spectrometry
- **Molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 (100%)**: Indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 156.
- **Peak at m/z = 158 (32%)**: Suggests the presence of a chlorine atom, as chlorine has two isotopes, Cl-35 (75%) and Cl-37 (25%). The ratio of M:M+2 (100:32) is close to the expected 3:1 ratio for Cl isotopes, allowing for minor experimental variations.

### Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy
- **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹**: Indicates the presence of an O-H group, likely from a carboxylic acid.
- **Strong sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹**: Consistent with a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, typical of a carboxylic acid.

### Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR)
- **11.0 ppm (s, 1H)**: A singlet at this downfield shift is characteristic of the carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).
- **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring, with two sets of equivalent protons.

### Analysis of Options
1. **Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**  
   - Contains three substituents (Cl, OH, and aldehyde) on the benzene ring, which would result in a more complex NMR pattern with more than two aromatic peaks.  
   - The IR data does not support the presence of an aldehyde (no strong peak around 2800 cm⁻¹ for C-H stretch).  
   - **Eliminated**.

2. **Option B: 4-Chlorobenzoic Acid**  
   - Contains a COOH group at position 1 and a Cl atom at position 4 on the benzene ring.  
   - The aromatic protons at positions 2 and 6 (ortho to COOH) are deshielded and appear as a doublet at 8.02 ppm. The protons at positions 3 and 5 (ortho to Cl) are less deshielded and appear as a doublet at 7.72 ppm.  
   - The IR data matches the broad O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid and the strong C=O stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹.  
   - The molecular weight (156) and the M:M+2 ratio (100:32) align with the presence of one Cl atom.  
   - **Matches all data**.

3. **Option C: Phenyl Chloroformate**  
   - Contains an ester group (Cl-CO-O-) attached to the benzene ring.  
   - The IR data does not support the presence of an O-H group, which is required for the broad peak in the 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ range.  
   - **Eliminated**.

4. **Option D: 2-Chlorobenzoic Acid**  
   - Contains a COOH group at position 1 and a Cl atom at position 2 on the benzene ring.  
   - This structure would result in an ortho-substituted benzene ring, leading to a more complex NMR pattern with overlapping peaks rather than two distinct doublets.  
   - **Eliminated**.

### Conclusion
The spectral data (mass, IR, and NMR) is most consistent with **4-chlorobenzoic acid**. The molecular weight, M:M+2 ratio, IR peaks, and NMR signals all align with this structure.

**Answer: B**
