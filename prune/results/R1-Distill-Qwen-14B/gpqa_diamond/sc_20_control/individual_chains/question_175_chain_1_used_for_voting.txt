Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to understand it step by step. The question is about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal, with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a certain wavelength lambda. 

The problem is asking about the radiated power per unit solid angle, which is a function f of lambda and the angle theta (with respect to the z-axis). They're giving that the maximum power is A, and the question is about the fraction of A radiated at theta = 30 degrees, as well as the possible form of f.

Hmm, right. So I think this relates to antenna radiation patterns or something like that. I remember that for a dipole antenna, the radiation pattern is a function of theta. The maximum power is along the equator, I think, so theta would be 90 degrees for maximum. But wait, wait. The oscillating charge distribution is spheroidal—so maybe it's more like a quadrupole or some higher-order multipole? Or perhaps it's an electric dipole?

Wait, the problem says it's spheroidal, which makes me think it's a dipole-like distribution. Because dipoles have a certain symmetry. Hmm, but for a pure dipole, the radiation pattern is maximum at theta = 90 degrees, as I said. The intensity goes like sin(theta) squared or something like that.

Wait, no. The radiation pattern for an electric dipole is given by the formula for the intensity (power per unit solid angle) being proportional to (sinθ)^2. So the maximum occurs at θ = 90°, which is perpendicular to the dipole's axis. So for that case, the maximum power would be A, and the power at θ = 30° would be (sin 30°)^2 times A.

Wait, sin(30) is 0.5, so squared is 0.25. So the fraction would be 1/4 of A. But wait, the problem is about the fraction of A. So if the max is A, then the fraction would be (sinθ)^2, so for θ=30°, it's 0.25, so 1/4 of A. 

So the fraction would be 1/4. So looking at the options, let's see which ones have 1/4 as the first part. Options B and C have 1/4. So now the question is about the form of f, the function.

Wait, what's the dependence of the radiated power per unit solid angle on lambda and theta? 

In the radiation zone (which is the far field), the electric and magnetic fields are proportional to 1/r, and the power, which is E times H, would be proportional to 1/r^2. The power per unit solid angle is the power flux, which should be proportional to the fields squared times sin(theta), perhaps? Or wait, the power per unit solid angle is the intensity, which is |E x H| / c. 

But for an oscillating dipole, the radiated power is known. The total power radiated by a dipole is given by P = ( (μ₀ μ² ω⁴ ) / (12 π ε₀ c³ ) ) * something. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the radiation pattern. For a dipole, the intensity (power per unit solid angle) is proportional to (sinθ)^2. But also, how does this depend on wavelength?

Wait, the problem states that the function f is a function of lambda and theta. The form of f would be f=lambda^something multiplied by some function of theta.

Wait, let me think about the dependence on wavelength. The oscillating charge distribution radiates at a wavelength lambda. The frequency is f = c / lambda, right? So omega is 2 pi f = 2 pi c / lambda.

In the expression for the radiated power, which is the Poynting vector, the dependence on omega is to the fourth power if I remember correctly. Because for a dipole, the fields are proportional to omega squared, so the power (which is E times H) is proportional to omega^4.

But the power per unit solid angle is the intensity, which is E times H divided by c. So intensity is proportional to (E)(H)/(c). E and H are each proportional to (omega^2) / r (since in the far field, E and H fall off as 1/r). Oh, but wait, wait: the total power is the integral of the intensity over all solid angles, which should be equal to the total power radiated.

But getting back, the intensity for a dipole is ( (d^2 p/dt^2 )^2 sinθ² ) / (something with c^5 and r^2). Let me make this precise.

The intensity (I) for a dipole is given by:

I = ( ( p^2 ω^4 sin²θ ) ) / ( 12 π ε₀ c^3 ) (1/r² )

Wait, no, perhaps I should recall the formula from the dipole radiation. The intensity is proportional to (p')² ω^4 sin²θ / r², where p' is the dipole moment. So, the intensity I is proportional to sin²θ multiplied by (1/r²) and (omega^4).

But the question is about the form of f, which is the intensity as a function of lambda and theta. So, f would be proportional to (1/r²) times (omega^4) times sin²theta. But in the radiation zone, we're considering r as being large, but in this problem, we're considering the function f as a function of lambda and theta.

Wait, but the problem says that in the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle is f(λ,θ). So f should include the dependence of the intensity on lambda and theta, but not on r.

Wait, but in the expression for I, we have 1/r^2, but I think the problem assumes that we are at a fixed distance, so f doesn't include the 1/r²—because the problem states that f is a function of λ and θ. So perhaps r is held constant in this context. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, perhaps the question is considering the angular dependence and the wavelength dependence, regardless of r. So when they say f is a function of λ and θ, perhaps r is factored out.

Alternatively, perhaps f is the angular dependence multiplied by the wavelength dependence, with the 1/r^2 factored out as a separate term.

Wait, perhaps the form of f is looking for the dependence on lambda, not on r. So, intensity I is proportional to 1/r², but since we're considering the shape of f, which is a function of λ and θ, perhaps f is the part that depends on λ and θ, not 1/r².

Wait, this is a bit unclear. Let me think again.

If the intensity is proportional to (omega^4) sin^2(theta) / r^2, and omega is 2 pi c / lambda, then omega^4 would be (1/lambda^4). So substituting, I is proportional to (1/lambda^4) sin^2(theta) / r^2.

But the problem states that in the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle (intensity) is a function f of lambda and theta. So putting it all together, f would have to include both the 1/lambda^4 term and the sin^2(theta) term, and perhaps the 1/r^2. But wait, the question says 'per unit solid angle', which already accounts for the 1/(r^2 sin theta) term, because solid angle dΩ = sin theta dtheta dphi. So, perhaps the intensity (which is power per unit solid angle) is proportional to (1/lambda^4) sin^2(theta) / r², but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, because in the formula, the intensity is (something) * (sin theta)^2 / (r^2). So when you express the intensity as a function of theta and lambda, perhaps r is a given parameter (fixed) in this context, so f would be proportional to sin^2(theta) * (1/lambda^4) * (1/r^2). But the problem is only asking for the form of f, so perhaps f is proportional to sin^2(theta) times lambda^(-4).

So the function f would be proportional to sin^2(theta) * lambda^(-4). Therefore, the form of f would be lambda^(-4) multiplied by sin^2(theta) perhaps.

Wait, but looking at the options, the possible forms of f are given as lambda^(-4), lambda^(-3), lambda^(-6), etc. So the options only give the power of lambda, not the theta part. So perhaps the question is asking what's the dependence on lambda, and the fraction at theta=30 degrees.

Wait, the question says: "the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle theta = 30° and a possible form of f are, respectively,".

So the first part is the fraction of the maximum power A radiated at theta=30°. The second part is the form of f (i.e., how f depends on lambda).

So, for the fraction, as I thought earlier, it's (sin 30°)^2 times A, which is (0.5)^2 = 1/4. So the fraction is 1/4 of A.

For the form of f, since the intensity is proportional to (1/lambda^4) times sin^2(theta), and the function f is given as f(λ,θ), which would have these dependencies. But the options only give the dependence on lambda, so f is proportional to lambda^(-4) multiplied by sin^2(theta), but the options just list the lambda part. So the possible form of f would have a lambda^(-4) dependence.

So the options are:

A) 1/2, λ^(-4)

B) 1/4, λ^(-3)

C) 1/4, λ^(-4)

D) 3/4, λ^(-6)

So the fraction is 1/4, and the form is lambda^(-4), so the correct option is C.

The problem involves an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroidal and symmetric about the z-axis. The radiated power per unit solid angle in the radiation zone is a function \( f(\lambda, \theta) \), where \( \lambda \) is the wavelength and \( \theta \) is the angle with respect to the z-axis. The maximum power radiated is \( A \), and the task is to determine the fraction of \( A \) radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \), as well as the possible form of \( f \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Fraction of Maximum Power at \( \theta = 30^\circ \):**
   - For a dipole-like radiation pattern, the intensity (power per unit solid angle) is proportional to \( \sin^2\theta \). 
   - At \( \theta = 30^\circ \), \( \sin(30^\circ) = 0.5 \), so \( \sin^2(30^\circ) = 0.25 \).
   - The fraction of the maximum power \( A \) radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is therefore \( 1/4 \).

2. **Form of \( f(\lambda, \theta) \):**
   - The intensity in the radiation zone is proportional to \( \sin^2\theta \) and \( \lambda^{-4} \). This arises because the oscillating charge distribution radiates at a frequency \( \omega = 2\pi c / \lambda \), and the intensity depends on \( \omega^4 \), which introduces the \( \lambda^{-4} \) dependence.
   - The problem specifies that \( f \) is a function of \( \lambda \) and \( \theta \), and the options only list the dependence on \( \lambda \). Thus, the form of \( f \) is \( \lambda^{-4} \).

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A:** \( 1/2, \lambda^{-4} \) — Incorrect, as the fraction is \( 1/4 \), not \( 1/2 \).
- **Option B:** \( 1/4, \lambda^{-3} \) — Incorrect, as the fraction is correct, but the dependence on \( \lambda \) is \( \lambda^{-4} \), not \( \lambda^{-3} \).
- **Option C:** \( 1/4, \lambda^{-4} \) — Correct, as both the fraction and the dependence on \( \lambda \) are accurate.
- **Option D:** \( 3/4, \lambda^{-6} \) — Incorrect, as the fraction is \( 1/4 \), not \( 3/4 \), and the dependence on \( \lambda \) is \( \lambda^{-4} \), not \( \lambda^{-6} \).

### Final Answer:
The fraction of \( A \) radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \( 1/4 \), and the form of \( f \) is \( \lambda^{-4} \).
