Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about the CERN Bubble Chamber and a decay process. Hmm, I remember that in particle physics, decay processes involve particles breaking down into other particles, and the lifetime of a particle affects how far it travels before decaying. 

The problem states that X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻ with a proper lifetime τ₀ of 8e-16 seconds. We need to find the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of these decays. The energy is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one.

Wait, first, I think the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when the particle is moving, its lifetime as observed in the lab frame (the Bubble Chamber's frame) would be longer due to time dilation. Oh right, time dilation from special relativity. The formula is τ = γ * τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor.

So, I need to calculate the Lorentz factor γ. But for that, I need the velocity of the particle, or alternatively, its energy and mass. Since the energy is given, maybe I can find the gamma factor from energy.

Wait, the energy E is given as 27 GeV, and the mass m is 3.41 GeV. The energy of a relativistic particle is E = γ m c². Since both E and m are given, I can find γ by dividing E by m. Wait, but wait, units: E is in GeV, and m is in GeV/c², so when you compute E/(m c²), that would be E/(m c²) = γ. Wait, let me get that right.

Wait, the formula is E = γ m c². So, γ = E/(m c²). But since E is given in GeV and m is in GeV/c², perhaps the units will cancel out when we compute E/(m c²). Let me see: E in GeV, m in GeV/c². So, E/(m c²) would be (GeV) / (GeV/c² * c²) ) = GeV/(GeV) ) → unitless, which is correct for gamma.

So, E is 27 GeV, m is 3.41 GeV/c². So γ = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.9178. Let me compute 27 / 3.41. 3.41 * 7 is 23.87, and 3.41*8 is 27.28. So 27 is about 7.9178 times 3.41. So γ is approximately 7.9178.

Next, the lifetime in the lab frame is τ = γ τ₀. τ₀ is 8e-16 seconds, so τ = 7.9178 * 8e-16 ≈ 63.34e-16 seconds, which is 6.334e-15 seconds. Wait, wait: 7.9178 *8 is 63.3424, so yeah, 63.3424e-16 s. Which is 6.33424e-15 s.

Now, the particle is moving, and during its lifetime, it travels a certain distance. The distance is L = v * τ. But to find v, we can use beta (β) times c. Because v = β c.

Wait, beta is v/c. And since γ = 1/sqrt(1 - β²), we can find β from gamma. Let me compute β. Another approach: since E = γ m c², and the momentum p is sqrt(γ² m² c^4 - m² c^4 ) / c. Wait, maybe it's easier to compute beta using gamma.

So, another formula: γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²). Rearranging, 1 - β² = 1 / γ² → β² = 1 - 1/γ². So, β = sqrt(1 - 1/γ²).

So, let's compute β with γ ≈7.9178. 1/γ² is approx 1/(7.9178)^2 ≈ 1/62.7 → roughly 0.01595. So 1 - 0.01595 is 0.98405. The square root of that is approximately 0.9920. Hmm, or wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 7.9178 squared: let's compute it. 7.9178 * 7.9178. 7^2 is 49, 0.9178^2 is about 0.842. Let me compute (7.9178)^2:

7.9178 *7.9178. Let's compute 7.9 *7.9 = 62.41. But perhaps a better way: (8 - 0.0822)^2 = 64 - 2*8*0.0822 + (0.0822)^2 ≈ 64 - 1.3152 + 0.00675 → approx 62.6915. So, γ^2 is about 62.6915.

So, 1/γ² is about 1/62.6915 ≈ 0.01595. So, 1 - 0.01595 = 0.98405. The square root of 0.98405 is approximately 0.9920. So, β ≈ 0.9920.

So, v = β c ≈ 0.9920 * c. c is about 3e8 meters per second.

Now, the lifetime in the lab frame is τ = 6.334e-15 seconds. The distance the particle travels is L = v * τ = 0.992 * 3e8 m/s * 6.334e-15 s.

Let me compute that. 0.992 is approximately 1 for rough calculation, but let's compute it accurately.

Multiplying 0.992 *3e8 gives 2.976e8 m/s. Now multiply by τ =6.334e-15 s:

2.976e8 * 6.334e-15 = ?

2.976e8 * 6.334e-15 = (2.976 *6.334 ) * 1e(8-15) )= 18.83 * 1e-7.

Wait, 2.976 *6.334: let's compute 3 *6.334 is 18.992, but 2.976 is 3 - 0.024. So, 3 *6.334 = 19.002. Then subtract 0.024 *6.334. 0.024 *6 is 0.144, 0.024 *0.334 is about 0.008. So total subtraction is 0.152. So, 19.002 -0.152=18.85.

So, 18.85e-7 meters. Which is 1.885e-6 meters. Wait, that's 1.885 micrometers.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a miscalculation. Let me double-check. 2.976e8 m/s multiplied by 6.334e-15 s.

Another way: 2.976 *6.334 = let's compute it exactly.

2.976 *6 =17.856; 2.976 *0.334=?

0.334 *2=0.668, 0.334 *0.976=?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 2.976 *6.334 as:

= (3 - 0.024) * (6 + 0.334)
= 3 *6 + 3 *0.334 - 0.024 *6 - 0.024 *0.334
= 18 + 1.002 - 0.144 - 0.008016
= 18 + 1.002 is 19.002, minus 0.144 is 18.858, minus 0.008016 is 18.849984.

So, approximately 18.85.

So, 18.85e-7 meters. Which is 1.885e-6 meters, or 1.885 micrometers.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays. Hmm, I think I must have missed something here.

Wait, the proper lifetime is τ₀, and the observed lifetime is longer. The distance the particle travels before decaying is L = v * τ. But how does that relate to the resolution needed?

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the minimum distance the chamber can resolve, so that a certain fraction of the particles decay within that distance. Oh, perhaps the question is about the minimum path length such that at least 30% of the particles decay within that length, which would correspond to a certain proper time.

Wait, but no, the problem states that the decay occurs, and we need to observe at least 30% of the decays. Hmm, perhaps we need to find the minimum resolution (the smallest distance that the chamber can distinguish) that allows us to see 30% of the decays. Or perhaps it's the minimum path length such that when the particle decays, the products are within the chamber's resolution.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking what is the minimum speed such that a certain fraction of particles decay within a certain time, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, I think I got confused. Let me think differently. The proper lifetime is τ₀, and the lifetime in the lab frame is τ = γ τ₀. The average distance the particle travels before decaying is L = v τ. So, the decay length is L = v τ.

The resolution of the Bubble Chamber determines the smallest distance it can measure. So, to observe a decay, the decay products must be separated by a distance larger than the resolution. But if the decay occurs within a very small distance, the chamber might not resolve it as a decay and might think it's a single point.

Wait, no, that's not quite it. The chamber can only observe the decay if the decay products are separated by a distance larger than the chamber's resolution. So, if the decay occurs over a very small distance (smaller than the resolution), the chamber can't distinguish that the decay happened; it just sees a single point. So, to observe the decay, the path length before decay must be longer than the resolution.

Wait, but that depends on the fraction of decays that happen beyond the resolution. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum resolution (smallest possible) such that at least 30% of the decays are observed. Hmm, that makes sense.

Wait, so the fraction of decays that happen beyond a certain distance L is determined by the decay probability. The decay follows an exponential distribution, so the probability that the decay occurs after a certain time t is P(t) = e^(-t/τ). But wait, in our case, the particle's lifetime is longer in the lab frame, so the decay probability after time t is P(t) = 1 - e^(-t/τ). Wait, no, the probability that the particle hasn't decayed by time t is e^(-t/τ), so the probability that it has decayed by time t is 1 - e^(-t/τ).

Wait, but in our case, the distance is L = v t, so t = L / v. So, the probability that the decay occurs before or at L is P = 1 - e^(-L/(v τ)).

Wait, but I think I'm getting this wrong. The proper approach is to model the decay length. The decay length distribution is L = v τ₀ gamma, since τ = gamma tau_0. Wait, no, the decay happens when a particle's lifetime is up, which in lab frame is longer. So the average decay length would be v * gamma tau_0.

But perhaps the problem is not about the average, but about the minimum L such that 30% of the decays are beyond that L. Hmm, no, wait, the chamber's resolution determines how small a decay length it can detect. If the decay length is less than the resolution, the chamber can't see the decay. So, we want to find the minimum resolution delta such that at least 30% of the decays have a decay length larger than delta. So, the probability P(L > delta) >= 0.3.

Wait, that makes sense. So, the chamber can only measure decays when the decay path is longer than the resolution. So, we need to find delta such that the probability that L > delta is 30%.

So, the decay length L is a random variable. The probability that L > delta is equal to the probability that the decay occurs after a time t where v t = delta → t = delta / v.

In the lab frame, the lifetime is τ = gamma tau_0. So, the decay probability that the decay occurs after time t is P(t) = e^(-t/tau), because the decay is an exponential process with mean lifetime tau.

So, the probability that L > delta is P(L>delta) = e^(-delta/(v tau)).

We want this probability to be 0.3. So, e^(-delta/(v tau)) = 0.3.

Taking natural logs: -delta/(v tau) = ln(0.3) → delta = -v tau ln(0.3)

Wait, ln(0.3) is negative. So, delta = v tau * (-ln(0.3)).

So, let's compute this.

But wait, let me double-check. The decay occurs with probability P(L < x) = 1 - e^(-x/(v tau)). So, P(L > x) = e^(-x/(v tau)). So, setting this equal to 0.3:

e^(-x/(v tau)) = 0.3 → -x/(v tau) = ln(0.3) → x = -(v tau) ln(0.3)

Since ln(0.3) is negative, x becomes positive.

So, x = v tau * (-ln(0.3)).

Let me compute the numerical values.

v is beta c. tau is gamma tau_0. So, v tau = beta c gamma tau_0.

But beta = v/c = (sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)) ) → beta = sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma^2))).

Wait, but earlier we found beta as approximately 0.992. So, let me compute beta * gamma.

Wait, beta * gamma = gamma * beta = gamma * sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma^2)).

But let's compute this with gamma =7.9178.

Alternatively, since gamma =7.9178, I can find beta as sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

gamma squared is approximately 62.7 (since 7.9178^2 ≈62.7).

So, 1/gamma^2 ≈0.01595. So, 1 - 0.01595=0.98405. sqrt(0.98405)=0.9920.

So, beta is approximately 0.9920.

So, beta * gamma =0.9920 *7.9178 → let's compute that.

7.9178 *0.9920 → 7.9178 *1 is 7.9178. Subtract 7.9178 *0.008 = 0.0633424. So, 7.9178 - 0.0633424 ≈7.8545.

So, beta * gamma ≈7.8545.

So, v tau = beta c gamma tau_0.

Wait, no, tau is gamma tau_0, so v tau = beta c gamma tau_0.

Wait, wait, tau is the lab lifetime, which is gamma tau_0. So, v tau = beta c * gamma tau_0.

Wait, but tau_0 is given as 8e-16 s.

So, plug in the numbers:

beta c gamma tau_0 = 0.992 * 3e8 m/s * 7.9178 *8e-16 s.

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

First, compute 0.992 *3e8 m/s → 0.992 *3e8 = approx 2.976e8 m/s.

Then, multiply by 7.9178 → 2.976e8 *7.9178 ≈ 2.36e9 m/s.

Wait, 2.976e8 *7.9178 = let's compute 2.976e8 *7.9178.

Wait, 2.976e8 *7 = 2.0832e9.

2.976e8 *0.9178= ?

0.9178e9 is 9.178e8. 2.976 *0.9178 = approximately 2.723.

So, 2.723e8 m/s.

So, total is 2.0832e9 + 2.723e8 ≈ 2.3555e9 m/s.

Multiply by tau_0=8e-16 s.

So, 2.3555e9 m/s *8e-16 s = 2.3555e9 *8e-16 = (2.3555 *8) * 1e(9-16) )= 18.844 * 1e-7 → 1.8844e-6 meters.

So, v tau = 1.8844e-6 meters.

Now, x = v tau * (-ln(0.3)).

What's ln(0.3)? Let me compute that. ln(0.3) is approximately -1.20397.

So, -ln(0.3) is 1.20397.

So, x = 1.8844e-6 m * 1.20397 ≈ 2.269e-6 meters.

Wait, but let's compute it more accurately.

x = 1.8844e-6 m *1.20397 ≈ (1.8844 *1.20397) e-6 m.

Compute 1.8844 *1.20397.

1.8844 *1.2 is 2.26128.

1.8844 *0.00397 → approximately 0.00744.

So, total approx 2.2687e-6 meters.

So, x ≈2.269e-6 meters.

Looking back at the options, option A is 2.08e-6 m, option B is 2.08e-9 m, etc.

Hmm, but wait, 2.269e-6 is approximately 2.27e-6 meters. The closest option is A) 2.08e-6 m. But perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let's see. When I computed beta * gamma, I got approximately 7.8545. Perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, gamma is 27 /3.41 = 7.917857.

Beta is sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma^2)).

gamma squared is (27/3.41)^2.

Let me compute 27/3.41 exactly.

3.41 *7 =23.87 → 27-23.87=3.13 left. 3.13 /3.41 is about 0.9178. So 7.9178.

gamma squared is (27/3.41)^2 = (27^2)/(3.41^2) = 729 / 11.6281 ≈62.69.

So, 1/gamma² is about 0.01595.

Thus, beta = sqrt(1 -0.01595) = sqrt(0.98405) ≈0.9920.

Now, beta * gamma = 0.9920 *7.9178 = Let me compute it accurately.

0.9920 *7 is 6.944, 0.9920 *0.9178 = approximately 0.909.

Wait, 0.9920 *7.9178 = 0.9920*(7 + 0.9178) = 6.944 + 0.9920*0.9178.

Compute 0.9920 *0.9178:

= (1 -0.008) * (0.9178) = 0.9178 - 0.008 *0.9178
= 0.9178 - 0.0073424 ≈0.9104576.

So, total beta * gamma =6.944 + 0.9104576 =7.8544576.

So, beta * gamma ≈7.8545.

Then, v tau = beta c gamma tau_0.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So, beta c gamma tau_0 = (0.992)*3e8 *7.9178 *8e-16.

Alternatively, I can compute it as beta * gamma * c * tau_0.

So, beta * gamma is 7.8545.

c is 3e8 m/s.

tau_0 is 8e-16 s.

So, v tau = 7.8545 *3e8 *8e-16.

Compute 7.8545 *3 =23.5635.

23.5635 *8 =188.508.

So, 7.8545 *3e8 *8e-16 =188.508e(8-16) =188.508e-8 =1.88508e-6 m.

So, v tau is 1.88508e-6 m.

Now, x = v tau * (-ln(0.3)).

As before, ln(0.3) is approximately -1.20397, so -ln(0.3)=1.20397.

So, x =1.88508e-6 m *1.20397 ≈ (1.88508 *1.20397) e-6.

Compute 1.88508 *1.20397.

Let me compute 1.88508 *1.20397.

1.88508 *1 =1.88508.

1.88508 *0.2 =0.377016.

1.88508 *0.00397 ≈ 0.00744.

Adding together: 1.88508 +0.377016=2.262096 +0.00744=2.269536.

So, x ≈2.2695e-6 m.

Looking at the options, option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is close but not exact. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation, or perhaps I need to recalculate with more precise numbers.

Wait, maybe I should compute beta * gamma more precisely.

gamma =27 /3.41 =7.917857.

gamma squared is (27/3.41)^2=729/ (3.41^2)=729/(11.6281)=62.6949.

So, 1/gamma^2=1/62.6949≈0.01595.

Wait, beta = sqrt(1-0.01595)=sqrt(0.98405)= approx 0.992024.

So, beta * gamma = 0.992024 *7.917857.

Let me compute this more accurately.

0.992024 *7 =6.944168.

0.992024 *0.917857:

Let me compute 0.992024 *0.917857.

First, 0.992024 *0.9 =0.8928216.

0.992024 *0.017857 → 0.992024 *0.017857 ≈0.01765.

So, 0.8928216 +0.01765 ≈0.91047.

So, beta * gamma =6.944168 +0.91047 =7.854638.

So, v tau =7.854638 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Wait, wait, v tau is beta c gamma tau_0.

Which is 7.854638 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Wait, no, it's (beta * gamma) * c * tau_0.

So, 7.854638 *3e8 *8e-16.

Let me compute that step by step.

7.854638 *3e8 = 23.563914e8 = 2.3563914e9.

Multiply by 8e-16: 2.3563914e9 *8e-16 = (2.3563914 *8 ) *1e(9-16)= 18.8511312 *1e-7 =1.88511312e-6 meters.

So, v tau is 1.8851e-6 m.

Then x = v tau * (-ln(0.3)).

Which is 1.8851e-6 m *1.20397 →1.8851e-6 *1.20397 ≈ 2.269e-6 m.

So, x≈2.269e-6 m.

Now, looking at the options, option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is close but not exactly what I got. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I should have taken the decay length L as the average, but the problem is about 30% of the decays being observed. Hmm.

Wait, the decay probability that L exceeds x is P(L>x) = e^(-x/(v tau)).

We set this to 0.3.

So, x = v tau * ln(1/0.3) → since ln(1/0.3) is positive.

Wait, ln(1/0.3)= ln(10/3)= approximately 1.20397.

So, x = v tau * 1.20397.

Which is what I did.

So, given that, I get x≈2.269e-6 m. But the closest option is A) 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating v tau. Let me double-check v tau.

v tau is beta * gamma * c * tau_0.

Wait, beta = v/c, so v tau = (v/c) * gamma * c * tau_0.

Which simplifies to v tau = v gamma tau_0.

But wait, tau in the lab frame is gamma tau_0. So, tau = gamma tau_0.

v tau = v gamma tau_0.

Which is the same as v gamma tau_0.

Wait, but v is beta c, so v gamma = beta c gamma.

Hm, perhaps I should compute it as (beta c) * gamma tau_0.

Wait, but gamma tau_0 is tau.

So, v tau = v * tau.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but let me compute beta * gamma again.

beta=0.992024, gamma=7.917857.

0.992024 *7.917857 = Let me compute this exactly.

0.992024 *7 =6.944168.

0.992024 *0.917857 = ?

Let me compute 0.992024 *0.917857.

0.992024 *0.9 = 0.8928216.

0.992024 *0.017857 = 0.992024 * (approx 0.017857).

Compute 0.992024 *0.017857:

= 0.992024 * (1.7857e-2) → approx 0.017655.

So, total is 0.8928216 +0.017655 ≈0.9104766.

So, beta * gamma =6.944168 +0.9104766=7.8546446.

So, beta * gamma ≈7.8546446.

v tau = beta * gamma * c * tau_0.

So, 7.8546446 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Wait, let me compute this:

7.8546446 *3e8 = 23.5639338e8 = 2.35639338e9.

Multiply by 8e-16:

2.35639338e9 *8e-16 = (2.35639338 *8 ) *1e(9-16) → 18.851147e-7 =1.8851147e-6 m.

So, v tau =1.8851147e-6 m.

Now, x= v tau * 1.20397 ≈1.8851147e-6 *1.20397.

Compute 1.8851147e-6 *1.20397.

= 1.8851147 *1.20397 *1e-6.

1.8851147 *1.20397.

Let me compute it more precisely.

1.8851147 *1.20397.

= 1.8851147 * (1 +0.2 +0.00397)

= 1.8851147 *1 =1.8851147

+ 1.8851147 *0.2 =0.37702294

+ 1.8851147 *0.00397 ≈0.0074528.

Adding them together: 1.8851147 +0.37702294=2.26213764 +0.0074528=2.26959044.

So, x=2.26959044e-6 m, which is 2.26959e-6 meters.

But the options don't have exactly this value. The closest is option A: 2.08e-6 m.

Hmm, did I make a mistake in calculating beta * gamma?

Wait, perhaps I should compute beta more accurately.

beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2) ).

gamma=7.917857.

gamma squared is (7.917857)^2.

Let me compute 7.917857^2.

7.917857 *7.917857.

Compute 7 *7 =49.

7 *0.917857 =6.424.999 (wait, 7 *0.917857 is 6.424.999? Wait, no: 7 *0.917857=6.425.

Wait, perhaps a better approach:

Compute 7.917857^2 = (8 - 0.082143)^2 =64 - 2*8*0.082143 + (0.082143)^2.

=64 - 1.314288 + 0.006746.

=64 -1.314288=62.685712 +0.006746=62.692458.

So, gamma squared is approximately 62.692458.

So, 1/gamma^2=1/62.692458≈0.01595.

Thus, beta = sqrt(1 -0.01595)=sqrt(0.98405)=0.992024.

So, beta is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects me to not consider the 30% as P(L>x)=0.3, but rather as P(L<x)=0.3. Maybe I got the condition wrong.

Wait, if the chamber can detect decays when the path length is larger than delta, then the probability that the decay occurs beyond delta is P(L>delta)=0.3.

But in the calculation, that gives x around 2.27e-6 m. But the option is 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, perhaps the question is reversed. Maybe it's asking for the resolution such that at least 30% of the decays are observed, meaning that the chamber can only measure decays if the path is longer than delta, so we need the minimum delta where 70% of decays are below delta, and 30% are above. No, that's the same as what I did.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the mean lifetime and set delta to the mean multiplied by a certain factor. But that's not what the question is asking.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the formula for x. Let me think again.

Wait, the decay follows an exponential distribution with mean L_0 = v tau. The probability that L > x is e^{-x/(L_0)}.

We set this equal to 0.3, so x = -L_0 ln(0.3) ≈1.20397 L_0.

So, x=1.20397 * (v tau).

So, v tau is 1.8851e-6 m.

x=1.20397 *1.8851e-6 = approx 2.269e-6 m.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the proper calculation should use gamma = E/(m c²). Wait, but energy is given in GeV, and mass is in GeV/c². So, E= gamma m c² → gamma = E/(m c²) → but wait, the units.

Wait, E in GeV, m in GeV/c².

E = gamma m c² → gamma = E/(m c²).

But if E is in GeV, m c² is in GeV, because m is in GeV/c², so m c² is in GeV.

So, gamma is E/(m c^2) → (27 GeV) / (3.41 GeV) = 27/3.41 =7.9178.

So, gamma is correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should recalculate all steps with more precise numbers to see if it approaches 2.08e-6.

Wait, let me compute 1.8851e-6 m multiplied by 1.20397.

1.8851e-6 *1.20397 = ?

1.8851 *1.20397:

Hmm, 1.8851 *1.2 is 2.26212.

1.8851 *0.00397≈ 0.00745.

So, adding together, 2.26212 +0.00745=2.26957.

So, 2.26957e-6 m.

So, 2.27e-6 m.

But the option is 2.08e-6 m. Hmm, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the gamma.

Wait, gamma=E/(m c²).

E is 27 GeV, m is 3.41 GeV/c².

So, gamma =27 /3.41 ≈7.9178.

Wait, but perhaps the mass is in GeV, not GeV/c²? No, the problem states the mass is 3.41 GeV. Hmm, but in natural units, c=1, so mass in GeV would have c² factor. Wait, perhaps I should double-check the units.

Wait, mass is given as 3.41 GeV, but in particle physics, mass is often expressed as m c² in GeV. So, m c²=3.41 GeV.

So, E = gamma m c² → gamma= E/(m c^2) =27/3.41=7.9178.

So, the calculation is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the average decay length and set that as the resolution. But the average decay length is L_avg = v tau =1.885e-6 m. So, option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is about 10% higher than L_avg. But that doesn't directly correspond to 30% probability.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the minimum velocity or something else.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simpler. Maybe the decay length is L = gamma v tau_0. Let me compute that.

v is beta c.

So, L= gamma * beta c tau_0.

Which is the same as beta gamma c tau_0.

Which is the same as v tau, which we've computed as 1.885e-6 m.

Hmm.

Wait, another approach: The minimum resolution delta is such that at least 30% of the decays are observed. So, the number of decays observed is 30% of the total. The total number of decays is governed by the exponential decay law.

The number of decays N is proportional to (1 - e^{-t/tau} ), where t is the time the particle exists before decaying. But here, the distance is L =v t. So, the probability that a decay occurs at a distance L is dP = (1/tau) e^{-L/(v tau)} dL.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the minimum L such that the integral from L to infinity of (1/tau) e^{-L/(v tau)} dL equals 0.3.

Which is exactly what I did before.

So, the solution x is approximately 2.27e-6 m, which is about 2.27 micrometers.

Looking at the options, option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is 2.08 micrometers. Hmm, perhaps there's a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's compute 27 divided by3.41 more accurately.

27 /3.41 = ?

3.41 *7=23.87

3.41 *7.9=23.87 + 3.41 *0.9=23.87 +3.069=26.939.

3.41 *7.917=?

3.41 *7.917 → 3.41 *7=23.87, 3.41*0.917= approx 3.125.

So, 23.87 +3.125=26.995.

So, 3.41 *7.917≈26.995, which is close to 27. So, 27/3.41≈7.9178.

So, gamma is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the error is in the calculation of v tau.

Wait, perhaps I should compute v tau more accurately.

v tau = beta * gamma * c * tau_0.

beta=0.992024, gamma=7.917857, c=3e8 m/s, tau_0=8e-16 s.

So, beta * gamma =0.992024 *7.917857 =7.8546446.

Multiply by c and tau_0: 7.8546446 *3e8 *8e-16.

7.8546446 *3=23.5639338.

23.5639338 *8=188.51147.

188.51147 *1e(8-16)=188.51147e-8 m=1.8851147e-6 m.

Yes, that's correct.

So, x=1.8851e-6 *1.20397≈2.269e-6 m.

Hmm. The given options don't include this value. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays, which would imply that the chamber's resolution must be larger than a certain value. So, the minimum resolution is the maximum between the calculated x and something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simpler and I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think: The minimum path length L that a certain fraction (e.g., 30%) of particles would have. So, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum L such that 30% of the particles have decay lengths longer than L. So, as before, the calculation is correct, but maybe the options have a typo, or perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the average decay length, which is v tau =1.885e-6 m, which isn't one of the options exactly, but option A is 2.08e-6 m, perhaps due to rounding.

Wait, let me check if 2.08e-6 m is 7.8546446 * 2.64e-7 m.

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute x with more precise numbers.

Wait, when I computed x as 2.269e-6 m, which is approximately 2.27 micrometers.

But option A is 2.08 micrometers.

Hmm, perhaps the correct calculation uses gamma=7.918, and then x= 1.885e-6 m *1.20397=2.267e-6 m.

But perhaps the question expects me to compute the mean decay length (v tau) and set it as the resolution, which is 1.885e-6 m. But that's not one of the options either. The options are:

A) 2.08e-6 m

B) 2.08e-9 m

C) 2.08e-1 m

D) 2.08e-3 m.

Wait, so option A is the only one in the same order of magnitude.

But why is the option 2.08e-6 m?

Wait, perhaps I should compute v tau more precisely.

v tau is beta * gamma * c * tau_0.

beta * gamma=7.8546446.

c=2.99792e8 m/s (more precisely).

tau_0=8e-16 s.

So, let me compute it accurately.

v tau=7.8546446 * 2.99792e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

7.8546446 *2.99792e8 → let's compute this.

7.8546446 *2.99792e8 ≈ (7.8546446 *3e8) → 2.35639338e9, but more precisely, 2.99792 is 3e8 - (3e8 -2.99792e8)= 2.99792e8=2.99792 *1e8.

7.8546446 *2.99792e8 = 7.8546446 *2.99792 *1e8.

Compute 7.8546446 *2.99792.

7.8546446 *2 =15.7092892.

7.8546446 *0.99792 → approximately 7.8546446 *0.99792 ≈7.835.

So, 15.7092892 +7.835≈23.544.

So, 23.544e8.

Multiply by 8e-16:

23.544e8 *8e-16 = 23.544 *8 * 1e(8-16) → 188.352e-8 →1.88352e-6 m.

So, v tau=1.88352e-6 m.

Then, x=1.88352e-6 *1.20397≈ 2.267e-6 m.

Still, same conclusion.

Hmm, perhaps the intended answer is option A, 2.08e-6 m. So I think the correct answer is A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of $X^0 \rightarrow Y^+Z^-$ in the CERN Bubble Chamber, we analyze the decay process using relativistic principles and exponential decay laws.

### Key Information:
- **Proper lifetime of $X^0$**: $\tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s}$.
- **Energy of $X^0$**: $E = 27 \, \text{GeV}$.
- **Mass of $X^0$**: $m = 3.41 \, \text{GeV}/c^2$.
- **Speed of light**: $c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}$.

### Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor $\gamma$
The Lorentz factor is given by:
\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2}.
\]
Since $E = 27 \, \text{GeV}$ and $m c^2 = 3.41 \, \text{GeV}$, we find:
\[
\gamma = \frac{27}{3.41} \approx 7.9178.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the lab-frame lifetime $\tau$
The lab-frame lifetime is dilated due to special relativity:
\[
\tau = \gamma \tau_0.
\]
Substituting $\gamma \approx 7.9178$ and $\tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s}$:
\[
\tau = 7.9178 \times 8 \times 10^{-16} \approx 6.334 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the velocity $\beta c$
The velocity $\beta$ is related to $\gamma$ by:
\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}.
\]
Substituting $\gamma \approx 7.9178$:
\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(7.9178)^2}} \approx \sqrt{1 - 0.01595} \approx \sqrt{0.98405} \approx 0.9920.
\]
Thus, the velocity is:
\[
v = \beta c \approx 0.9920 \times 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \approx 2.976 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the average decay length $L$
The average decay length is:
\[
L = v \tau.
\]
Substituting $v \approx 2.976 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}$ and $\tau \approx 6.334 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{s}$:
\[
L = (2.976 \times 10^8) \times (6.334 \times 10^{-15}) \approx 1.885 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 5: Determine the minimum resolution $\delta$
To observe at least 30% of the decays, we need the minimum resolution $\delta$ such that:
\[
P(L > \delta) \geq 0.3.
\]
The probability of a decay occurring beyond $\delta$ is given by:
\[
P(L > \delta) = e^{-\delta / L}.
\]
Setting $P(L > \delta) = 0.3$:
\[
e^{-\delta / L} = 0.3 \implies -\frac{\delta}{L} = \ln(0.3) \implies \delta = -L \ln(0.3).
\]
Using $\ln(0.3) \approx -1.20397$:
\[
\delta = L \times 1.20397 \approx (1.885 \times 10^{-6}) \times 1.20397 \approx 2.269 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 6: Compare with the options
The calculated minimum resolution $\delta \approx 2.269 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}$ is closest to option **A) $2.08 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}$**, which is likely rounded or approximated.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: A**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about the CERN Bubble Chamber and a decay process. Hmm, I remember that in particle physics, decay processes involve particles breaking down into other particles, and the lifetime of a particle affects how far it travels before decaying. 

The problem states that X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻ with a proper lifetime τ₀ of 8e-16 seconds. We need to find the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of these decays. The energy is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one.

Wait, first, I think the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when the particle is moving, its lifetime as observed in the lab frame (the Bubble Chamber's frame) would be longer due to time dilation. Oh right, time dilation from special relativity. The formula is τ = γ * τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor.

So, I need to calculate the Lorentz factor γ. But for that, I need the velocity of the particle, or alternatively, its energy and mass. Since the energy is given, maybe I can find the gamma factor from energy.

Wait, the energy E is given as 27 GeV, and the mass m is 3.41 GeV. The energy of a relativistic particle is E = γ m c². Since both E and m are given, I can find γ by dividing E by m. Wait, but wait, units: E is in GeV, and m is in GeV/c², so when you compute E/(m c²), that would be E/(m c²) = γ. Wait, let me get that right.

Wait, the formula is E = γ m c². So, γ = E/(m c²). But since E is given in GeV and m is in GeV/c², perhaps the units will cancel out when we compute E/(m c²). Let me see: E in GeV, m in GeV/c². So, E/(m c²) would be (GeV) / (GeV/c² * c²) ) = GeV/(GeV) ) → unitless, which is correct for gamma.

So, E is 27 GeV, m is 3.41 GeV/c². So γ = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.9178. Let me compute 27 / 3.41. 3.41 * 7 is 23.87, and 3.41*8 is 27.28. So 27 is about 7.9178 times 3.41. So γ is approximately 7.9178.

Next, the lifetime in the lab frame is τ = γ τ₀. τ₀ is 8e-16 seconds, so τ = 7.9178 * 8e-16 ≈ 63.34e-16 seconds, which is 6.334e-15 seconds. Wait, wait: 7.9178 *8 is 63.3424, so yeah, 63.3424e-16 s. Which is 6.33424e-15 s.

Now, the particle is moving, and during its lifetime, it travels a certain distance. The distance is L = v * τ. But to find v, we can use beta (β) times c. Because v = β c.

Wait, beta is v/c. And since γ = 1/sqrt(1 - β²), we can find β from gamma. Let me compute β. Another approach: since E = γ m c², and the momentum p is sqrt(γ² m² c^4 - m² c^4 ) / c. Wait, maybe it's easier to compute beta using gamma.

So, another formula: γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²). Rearranging, 1 - β² = 1 / γ² → β² = 1 - 1/γ². So, β = sqrt(1 - 1/γ²).

So, let's compute β with γ ≈7.9178. 1/γ² is approx 1/(7.9178)^2 ≈ 1/62.7 → roughly 0.01595. So 1 - 0.01595 is 0.98405. The square root of that is approximately 0.9920. Hmm, or wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 7.9178 squared: let's compute it. 7.9178 * 7.9178. 7^2 is 49, 0.9178^2 is about 0.842. Let me compute (7.9178)^2:

7.9178 *7.9178. Let's compute 7.9 *7.9 = 62.41. But perhaps a better way: (8 - 0.0822)^2 = 64 - 2*8*0.0822 + (0.0822)^2 ≈ 64 - 1.3152 + 0.00675 → approx 62.6915. So, γ^2 is about 62.6915.

So, 1/γ² is about 1/62.6915 ≈ 0.01595. So, 1 - 0.01595 = 0.98405. The square root of 0.98405 is approximately 0.9920. So, β ≈ 0.9920.

So, v = β c ≈ 0.9920 * c. c is about 3e8 meters per second.

Now, the lifetime in the lab frame is τ = 6.334e-15 seconds. The distance the particle travels is L = v * τ = 0.992 * 3e8 m/s * 6.334e-15 s.

Let me compute that. 0.992 is approximately 1 for rough calculation, but let's compute it accurately.

Multiplying 0.992 *3e8 gives 2.976e8 m/s. Now multiply by τ =6.334e-15 s:

2.976e8 * 6.334e-15 = ?

2.976e8 * 6.334e-15 = (2.976 *6.334 ) * 1e(8-15) )= 18.83 * 1e-7.

Wait, 2.976 *6.334: let's compute 3 *6.334 is 18.992, but 2.976 is 3 - 0.024. So, 3 *6.334 = 19.002. Then subtract 0.024 *6.334. 0.024 *6 is 0.144, 0.024 *0.334 is about 0.008. So total subtraction is 0.152. So, 19.002 -0.152=18.85.

So, 18.85e-7 meters. Which is 1.885e-6 meters. Wait, that's 1.885 micrometers.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a miscalculation. Let me double-check. 2.976e8 m/s multiplied by 6.334e-15 s.

Another way: 2.976 *6.334 = let's compute it exactly.

2.976 *6 =17.856; 2.976 *0.334=?

0.334 *2=0.668, 0.334 *0.976=?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 2.976 *6.334 as:

= (3 - 0.024) * (6 + 0.334)
= 3 *6 + 3 *0.334 - 0.024 *6 - 0.024 *0.334
= 18 + 1.002 - 0.144 - 0.008016
= 18 + 1.002 is 19.002, minus 0.144 is 18.858, minus 0.008016 is 18.849984.

So, approximately 18.85.

So, 18.85e-7 meters. Which is 1.885e-6 meters, or 1.885 micrometers.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays. Hmm, I think I must have missed something here.

Wait, the proper lifetime is τ₀, and the observed lifetime is longer. The distance the particle travels before decaying is L = v * τ. But how does that relate to the resolution needed?

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the minimum distance the chamber can resolve, so that a certain fraction of the particles decay within that distance. Oh, perhaps the question is about the minimum path length such that at least 30% of the particles decay within that length, which would correspond to a certain proper time.

Wait, but no, the problem states that the decay occurs, and we need to observe at least 30% of the decays. Hmm, perhaps we need to find the minimum resolution (the smallest distance that the chamber can distinguish) that allows us to see 30% of the decays. Or perhaps it's the minimum path length such that when the particle decays, the products are within the chamber's resolution.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking what is the minimum speed such that a certain fraction of particles decay within a certain time, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, I think I got confused. Let me think differently. The proper lifetime is τ₀, and the lifetime in the lab frame is τ = γ τ₀. The average distance the particle travels before decaying is L = v τ. So, the decay length is L = v τ.

The resolution of the Bubble Chamber determines the smallest distance it can measure. So, to observe a decay, the decay products must be separated by a distance larger than the resolution. But if the decay occurs within a very small distance, the chamber might not resolve it as a decay and might think it's a single point.

Wait, no, that's not quite it. The chamber can only observe the decay if the decay products are separated by a distance larger than the chamber's resolution. So, if the decay occurs over a very small distance (smaller than the resolution), the chamber can't distinguish that the decay happened; it just sees a single point. So, to observe the decay, the path length before decay must be longer than the resolution.

Wait, but that depends on the fraction of decays that happen beyond the resolution. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum resolution (smallest possible) such that at least 30% of the decays are observed. Hmm, that makes sense.

Wait, so the fraction of decays that happen beyond a certain distance L is determined by the decay probability. The decay follows an exponential distribution, so the probability that the decay occurs after a certain time t is P(t) = e^(-t/τ). But wait, in our case, the particle's lifetime is longer in the lab frame, so the decay probability after time t is P(t) = 1 - e^(-t/τ). Wait, no, the probability that the particle hasn't decayed by time t is e^(-t/τ), so the probability that it has decayed by time t is 1 - e^(-t/τ).

Wait, but in our case, the distance is L = v t, so t = L / v. So, the probability that the decay occurs before or at L is P = 1 - e^(-L/(v τ)).

Wait, but I think I'm getting this wrong. The proper approach is to model the decay length. The decay length distribution is L = v τ₀ gamma, since τ = gamma tau_0. Wait, no, the decay happens when a particle's lifetime is up, which in lab frame is longer. So the average decay length would be v * gamma tau_0.

But perhaps the problem is not about the average, but about the minimum L such that 30% of the decays are beyond that L. Hmm, no, wait, the chamber's resolution determines how small a decay length it can detect. If the decay length is less than the resolution, the chamber can't see the decay. So, we want to find the minimum resolution delta such that at least 30% of the decays have a decay length larger than delta. So, the probability P(L > delta) >= 0.3.

Wait, that makes sense. So, the chamber can only measure decays when the decay path is longer than the resolution. So, we need to find delta such that the probability that L > delta is 30%.

So, the decay length L is a random variable. The probability that L > delta is equal to the probability that the decay occurs after a time t where v t = delta → t = delta / v.

In the lab frame, the lifetime is τ = gamma tau_0. So, the decay probability that the decay occurs after time t is P(t) = e^(-t/tau), because the decay is an exponential process with mean lifetime tau.

So, the probability that L > delta is P(L>delta) = e^(-delta/(v tau)).

We want this probability to be 0.3. So, e^(-delta/(v tau)) = 0.3.

Taking natural logs: -delta/(v tau) = ln(0.3) → delta = -v tau ln(0.3)

Wait, ln(0.3) is negative. So, delta = v tau * (-ln(0.3)).

So, let's compute this.

But wait, let me double-check. The decay occurs with probability P(L < x) = 1 - e^(-x/(v tau)). So, P(L > x) = e^(-x/(v tau)). So, setting this equal to 0.3:

e^(-x/(v tau)) = 0.3 → -x/(v tau) = ln(0.3) → x = -(v tau) ln(0.3)

Since ln(0.3) is negative, x becomes positive.

So, x = v tau * (-ln(0.3)).

Let me compute the numerical values.

v is beta c. tau is gamma tau_0. So, v tau = beta c gamma tau_0.

But beta = v/c = (sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)) ) → beta = sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma^2))).

Wait, but earlier we found beta as approximately 0.992. So, let me compute beta * gamma.

Wait, beta * gamma = gamma * beta = gamma * sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma^2)).

But let's compute this with gamma =7.9178.

Alternatively, since gamma =7.9178, I can find beta as sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

gamma squared is approximately 62.7 (since 7.9178^2 ≈62.7).

So, 1/gamma^2 ≈0.01595. So, 1 - 0.01595=0.98405. sqrt(0.98405)=0.9920.

So, beta is approximately 0.9920.

So, beta * gamma =0.9920 *7.9178 → let's compute that.

7.9178 *0.9920 → 7.9178 *1 is 7.9178. Subtract 7.9178 *0.008 = 0.0633424. So, 7.9178 - 0.0633424 ≈7.8545.

So, beta * gamma ≈7.8545.

So, v tau = beta c gamma tau_0.

Wait, no, tau is gamma tau_0, so v tau = beta c gamma tau_0.

Wait, wait, tau is the lab lifetime, which is gamma tau_0. So, v tau = beta c * gamma tau_0.

Wait, but tau_0 is given as 8e-16 s.

So, plug in the numbers:

beta c gamma tau_0 = 0.992 * 3e8 m/s * 7.9178 *8e-16 s.

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

First, compute 0.992 *3e8 m/s → 0.992 *3e8 = approx 2.976e8 m/s.

Then, multiply by 7.9178 → 2.976e8 *7.9178 ≈ 2.36e9 m/s.

Wait, 2.976e8 *7.9178 = let's compute 2.976e8 *7.9178.

Wait, 2.976e8 *7 = 2.0832e9.

2.976e8 *0.9178= ?

0.9178e9 is 9.178e8. 2.976 *0.9178 = approximately 2.723.

So, 2.723e8 m/s.

So, total is 2.0832e9 + 2.723e8 ≈ 2.3555e9 m/s.

Multiply by tau_0=8e-16 s.

So, 2.3555e9 m/s *8e-16 s = 2.3555e9 *8e-16 = (2.3555 *8) * 1e(9-16) )= 18.844 * 1e-7 → 1.8844e-6 meters.

So, v tau = 1.8844e-6 meters.

Now, x = v tau * (-ln(0.3)).

What's ln(0.3)? Let me compute that. ln(0.3) is approximately -1.20397.

So, -ln(0.3) is 1.20397.

So, x = 1.8844e-6 m * 1.20397 ≈ 2.269e-6 meters.

Wait, but let's compute it more accurately.

x = 1.8844e-6 m *1.20397 ≈ (1.8844 *1.20397) e-6 m.

Compute 1.8844 *1.20397.

1.8844 *1.2 is 2.26128.

1.8844 *0.00397 → approximately 0.00744.

So, total approx 2.2687e-6 meters.

So, x ≈2.269e-6 meters.

Looking back at the options, option A is 2.08e-6 m, option B is 2.08e-9 m, etc.

Hmm, but wait, 2.269e-6 is approximately 2.27e-6 meters. The closest option is A) 2.08e-6 m. But perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let's see. When I computed beta * gamma, I got approximately 7.8545. Perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, gamma is 27 /3.41 = 7.917857.

Beta is sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma^2)).

gamma squared is (27/3.41)^2.

Let me compute 27/3.41 exactly.

3.41 *7 =23.87 → 27-23.87=3.13 left. 3.13 /3.41 is about 0.9178. So 7.9178.

gamma squared is (27/3.41)^2 = (27^2)/(3.41^2) = 729 / 11.6281 ≈62.69.

So, 1/gamma² is about 0.01595.

Thus, beta = sqrt(1 -0.01595) = sqrt(0.98405) ≈0.9920.

Now, beta * gamma = 0.9920 *7.9178 = Let me compute it accurately.

0.9920 *7 is 6.944, 0.9920 *0.9178 = approximately 0.909.

Wait, 0.9920 *7.9178 = 0.9920*(7 + 0.9178) = 6.944 + 0.9920*0.9178.

Compute 0.9920 *0.9178:

= (1 -0.008) * (0.9178) = 0.9178 - 0.008 *0.9178
= 0.9178 - 0.0073424 ≈0.9104576.

So, total beta * gamma =6.944 + 0.9104576 =7.8544576.

So, beta * gamma ≈7.8545.

Then, v tau = beta c gamma tau_0.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So, beta c gamma tau_0 = (0.992)*3e8 *7.9178 *8e-16.

Alternatively, I can compute it as beta * gamma * c * tau_0.

So, beta * gamma is 7.8545.

c is 3e8 m/s.

tau_0 is 8e-16 s.

So, v tau = 7.8545 *3e8 *8e-16.

Compute 7.8545 *3 =23.5635.

23.5635 *8 =188.508.

So, 7.8545 *3e8 *8e-16 =188.508e(8-16) =188.508e-8 =1.88508e-6 m.

So, v tau is 1.88508e-6 m.

Now, x = v tau * (-ln(0.3)).

As before, ln(0.3) is approximately -1.20397, so -ln(0.3)=1.20397.

So, x =1.88508e-6 m *1.20397 ≈ (1.88508 *1.20397) e-6.

Compute 1.88508 *1.20397.

Let me compute 1.88508 *1.20397.

1.88508 *1 =1.88508.

1.88508 *0.2 =0.377016.

1.88508 *0.00397 ≈ 0.00744.

Adding together: 1.88508 +0.377016=2.262096 +0.00744=2.269536.

So, x ≈2.2695e-6 m.

Looking at the options, option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is close but not exact. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation, or perhaps I need to recalculate with more precise numbers.

Wait, maybe I should compute beta * gamma more precisely.

gamma =27 /3.41 =7.917857.

gamma squared is (27/3.41)^2=729/ (3.41^2)=729/(11.6281)=62.6949.

So, 1/gamma^2=1/62.6949≈0.01595.

Wait, beta = sqrt(1-0.01595)=sqrt(0.98405)= approx 0.992024.

So, beta * gamma = 0.992024 *7.917857.

Let me compute this more accurately.

0.992024 *7 =6.944168.

0.992024 *0.917857:

Let me compute 0.992024 *0.917857.

First, 0.992024 *0.9 =0.8928216.

0.992024 *0.017857 → 0.992024 *0.017857 ≈0.01765.

So, 0.8928216 +0.01765 ≈0.91047.

So, beta * gamma =6.944168 +0.91047 =7.854638.

So, v tau =7.854638 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Wait, wait, v tau is beta c gamma tau_0.

Which is 7.854638 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Wait, no, it's (beta * gamma) * c * tau_0.

So, 7.854638 *3e8 *8e-16.

Let me compute that step by step.

7.854638 *3e8 = 23.563914e8 = 2.3563914e9.

Multiply by 8e-16: 2.3563914e9 *8e-16 = (2.3563914 *8 ) *1e(9-16)= 18.8511312 *1e-7 =1.88511312e-6 meters.

So, v tau is 1.8851e-6 m.

Then x = v tau * (-ln(0.3)).

Which is 1.8851e-6 m *1.20397 →1.8851e-6 *1.20397 ≈ 2.269e-6 m.

So, x≈2.269e-6 m.

Now, looking at the options, option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is close but not exactly what I got. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I should have taken the decay length L as the average, but the problem is about 30% of the decays being observed. Hmm.

Wait, the decay probability that L exceeds x is P(L>x) = e^(-x/(v tau)).

We set this to 0.3.

So, x = v tau * ln(1/0.3) → since ln(1/0.3) is positive.

Wait, ln(1/0.3)= ln(10/3)= approximately 1.20397.

So, x = v tau * 1.20397.

Which is what I did.

So, given that, I get x≈2.269e-6 m. But the closest option is A) 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating v tau. Let me double-check v tau.

v tau is beta * gamma * c * tau_0.

Wait, beta = v/c, so v tau = (v/c) * gamma * c * tau_0.

Which simplifies to v tau = v gamma tau_0.

But wait, tau in the lab frame is gamma tau_0. So, tau = gamma tau_0.

v tau = v gamma tau_0.

Which is the same as v gamma tau_0.

Wait, but v is beta c, so v gamma = beta c gamma.

Hm, perhaps I should compute it as (beta c) * gamma tau_0.

Wait, but gamma tau_0 is tau.

So, v tau = v * tau.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but let me compute beta * gamma again.

beta=0.992024, gamma=7.917857.

0.992024 *7.917857 = Let me compute this exactly.

0.992024 *7 =6.944168.

0.992024 *0.917857 = ?

Let me compute 0.992024 *0.917857.

0.992024 *0.9 = 0.8928216.

0.992024 *0.017857 = 0.992024 * (approx 0.017857).

Compute 0.992024 *0.017857:

= 0.992024 * (1.7857e-2) → approx 0.017655.

So, total is 0.8928216 +0.017655 ≈0.9104766.

So, beta * gamma =6.944168 +0.9104766=7.8546446.

So, beta * gamma ≈7.8546446.

v tau = beta * gamma * c * tau_0.

So, 7.8546446 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Wait, let me compute this:

7.8546446 *3e8 = 23.5639338e8 = 2.35639338e9.

Multiply by 8e-16:

2.35639338e9 *8e-16 = (2.35639338 *8 ) *1e(9-16) → 18.851147e-7 =1.8851147e-6 m.

So, v tau =1.8851147e-6 m.

Now, x= v tau * 1.20397 ≈1.8851147e-6 *1.20397.

Compute 1.8851147e-6 *1.20397.

= 1.8851147 *1.20397 *1e-6.

1.8851147 *1.20397.

Let me compute it more precisely.

1.8851147 *1.20397.

= 1.8851147 * (1 +0.2 +0.00397)

= 1.8851147 *1 =1.8851147

+ 1.8851147 *0.2 =0.37702294

+ 1.8851147 *0.00397 ≈0.0074528.

Adding them together: 1.8851147 +0.37702294=2.26213764 +0.0074528=2.26959044.

So, x=2.26959044e-6 m, which is 2.26959e-6 meters.

But the options don't have exactly this value. The closest is option A: 2.08e-6 m.

Hmm, did I make a mistake in calculating beta * gamma?

Wait, perhaps I should compute beta more accurately.

beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2) ).

gamma=7.917857.

gamma squared is (7.917857)^2.

Let me compute 7.917857^2.

7.917857 *7.917857.

Compute 7 *7 =49.

7 *0.917857 =6.424.999 (wait, 7 *0.917857 is 6.424.999? Wait, no: 7 *0.917857=6.425.

Wait, perhaps a better approach:

Compute 7.917857^2 = (8 - 0.082143)^2 =64 - 2*8*0.082143 + (0.082143)^2.

=64 - 1.314288 + 0.006746.

=64 -1.314288=62.685712 +0.006746=62.692458.

So, gamma squared is approximately 62.692458.

So, 1/gamma^2=1/62.692458≈0.01595.

Thus, beta = sqrt(1 -0.01595)=sqrt(0.98405)=0.992024.

So, beta is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects me to not consider the 30% as P(L>x)=0.3, but rather as P(L<x)=0.3. Maybe I got the condition wrong.

Wait, if the chamber can detect decays when the path length is larger than delta, then the probability that the decay occurs beyond delta is P(L>delta)=0.3.

But in the calculation, that gives x around 2.27e-6 m. But the option is 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, perhaps the question is reversed. Maybe it's asking for the resolution such that at least 30% of the decays are observed, meaning that the chamber can only measure decays if the path is longer than delta, so we need the minimum delta where 70% of decays are below delta, and 30% are above. No, that's the same as what I did.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the mean lifetime and set delta to the mean multiplied by a certain factor. But that's not what the question is asking.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the formula for x. Let me think again.

Wait, the decay follows an exponential distribution with mean L_0 = v tau. The probability that L > x is e^{-x/(L_0)}.

We set this equal to 0.3, so x = -L_0 ln(0.3) ≈1.20397 L_0.

So, x=1.20397 * (v tau).

So, v tau is 1.8851e-6 m.

x=1.20397 *1.8851e-6 = approx 2.269e-6 m.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the proper calculation should use gamma = E/(m c²). Wait, but energy is given in GeV, and mass is in GeV/c². So, E= gamma m c² → gamma = E/(m c²) → but wait, the units.

Wait, E in GeV, m in GeV/c².

E = gamma m c² → gamma = E/(m c²).

But if E is in GeV, m c² is in GeV, because m is in GeV/c², so m c² is in GeV.

So, gamma is E/(m c^2) → (27 GeV) / (3.41 GeV) = 27/3.41 =7.9178.

So, gamma is correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should recalculate all steps with more precise numbers to see if it approaches 2.08e-6.

Wait, let me compute 1.8851e-6 m multiplied by 1.20397.

1.8851e-6 *1.20397 = ?

1.8851 *1.20397:

Hmm, 1.8851 *1.2 is 2.26212.

1.8851 *0.00397≈ 0.00745.

So, adding together, 2.26212 +0.00745=2.26957.

So, 2.26957e-6 m.

So, 2.27e-6 m.

But the option is 2.08e-6 m. Hmm, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the gamma.

Wait, gamma=E/(m c²).

E is 27 GeV, m is 3.41 GeV/c².

So, gamma =27 /3.41 ≈7.9178.

Wait, but perhaps the mass is in GeV, not GeV/c²? No, the problem states the mass is 3.41 GeV. Hmm, but in natural units, c=1, so mass in GeV would have c² factor. Wait, perhaps I should double-check the units.

Wait, mass is given as 3.41 GeV, but in particle physics, mass is often expressed as m c² in GeV. So, m c²=3.41 GeV.

So, E = gamma m c² → gamma= E/(m c^2) =27/3.41=7.9178.

So, the calculation is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the average decay length and set that as the resolution. But the average decay length is L_avg = v tau =1.885e-6 m. So, option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is about 10% higher than L_avg. But that doesn't directly correspond to 30% probability.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the minimum velocity or something else.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simpler. Maybe the decay length is L = gamma v tau_0. Let me compute that.

v is beta c.

So, L= gamma * beta c tau_0.

Which is the same as beta gamma c tau_0.

Which is the same as v tau, which we've computed as 1.885e-6 m.

Hmm.

Wait, another approach: The minimum resolution delta is such that at least 30% of the decays are observed. So, the number of decays observed is 30% of the total. The total number of decays is governed by the exponential decay law.

The number of decays N is proportional to (1 - e^{-t/tau} ), where t is the time the particle exists before decaying. But here, the distance is L =v t. So, the probability that a decay occurs at a distance L is dP = (1/tau) e^{-L/(v tau)} dL.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the minimum L such that the integral from L to infinity of (1/tau) e^{-L/(v tau)} dL equals 0.3.

Which is exactly what I did before.

So, the solution x is approximately 2.27e-6 m, which is about 2.27 micrometers.

Looking at the options, option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is 2.08 micrometers. Hmm, perhaps there's a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's compute 27 divided by3.41 more accurately.

27 /3.41 = ?

3.41 *7=23.87

3.41 *7.9=23.87 + 3.41 *0.9=23.87 +3.069=26.939.

3.41 *7.917=?

3.41 *7.917 → 3.41 *7=23.87, 3.41*0.917= approx 3.125.

So, 23.87 +3.125=26.995.

So, 3.41 *7.917≈26.995, which is close to 27. So, 27/3.41≈7.9178.

So, gamma is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the error is in the calculation of v tau.

Wait, perhaps I should compute v tau more accurately.

v tau = beta * gamma * c * tau_0.

beta=0.992024, gamma=7.917857, c=3e8 m/s, tau_0=8e-16 s.

So, beta * gamma =0.992024 *7.917857 =7.8546446.

Multiply by c and tau_0: 7.8546446 *3e8 *8e-16.

7.8546446 *3=23.5639338.

23.5639338 *8=188.51147.

188.51147 *1e(8-16)=188.51147e-8 m=1.8851147e-6 m.

Yes, that's correct.

So, x=1.8851e-6 *1.20397≈2.269e-6 m.

Hmm. The given options don't include this value. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays, which would imply that the chamber's resolution must be larger than a certain value. So, the minimum resolution is the maximum between the calculated x and something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simpler and I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think: The minimum path length L that a certain fraction (e.g., 30%) of particles would have. So, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum L such that 30% of the particles have decay lengths longer than L. So, as before, the calculation is correct, but maybe the options have a typo, or perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the average decay length, which is v tau =1.885e-6 m, which isn't one of the options exactly, but option A is 2.08e-6 m, perhaps due to rounding.

Wait, let me check if 2.08e-6 m is 7.8546446 * 2.64e-7 m.

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute x with more precise numbers.

Wait, when I computed x as 2.269e-6 m, which is approximately 2.27 micrometers.

But option A is 2.08 micrometers.

Hmm, perhaps the correct calculation uses gamma=7.918, and then x= 1.885e-6 m *1.20397=2.267e-6 m.

But perhaps the question expects me to compute the mean decay length (v tau) and set it as the resolution, which is 1.885e-6 m. But that's not one of the options either. The options are:

A) 2.08e-6 m

B) 2.08e-9 m

C) 2.08e-1 m

D) 2.08e-3 m.

Wait, so option A is the only one in the same order of magnitude.

But why is the option 2.08e-6 m?

Wait, perhaps I should compute v tau more precisely.

v tau is beta * gamma * c * tau_0.

beta * gamma=7.8546446.

c=2.99792e8 m/s (more precisely).

tau_0=8e-16 s.

So, let me compute it accurately.

v tau=7.8546446 * 2.99792e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

7.8546446 *2.99792e8 → let's compute this.

7.8546446 *2.99792e8 ≈ (7.8546446 *3e8) → 2.35639338e9, but more precisely, 2.99792 is 3e8 - (3e8 -2.99792e8)= 2.99792e8=2.99792 *1e8.

7.8546446 *2.99792e8 = 7.8546446 *2.99792 *1e8.

Compute 7.8546446 *2.99792.

7.8546446 *2 =15.7092892.

7.8546446 *0.99792 → approximately 7.8546446 *0.99792 ≈7.835.

So, 15.7092892 +7.835≈23.544.

So, 23.544e8.

Multiply by 8e-16:

23.544e8 *8e-16 = 23.544 *8 * 1e(8-16) → 188.352e-8 →1.88352e-6 m.

So, v tau=1.88352e-6 m.

Then, x=1.88352e-6 *1.20397≈ 2.267e-6 m.

Still, same conclusion.

Hmm, perhaps the intended answer is option A, 2.08e-6 m. So I think the correct answer is A.


To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of $X^0 \rightarrow Y^+Z^-$ in the CERN Bubble Chamber, we analyze the decay process using relativistic principles and exponential decay laws.

### Key Information:
- **Proper lifetime of $X^0$**: $\tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s}$.
- **Energy of $X^0$**: $E = 27 \, \text{GeV}$.
- **Mass of $X^0$**: $m = 3.41 \, \text{GeV}/c^2$.
- **Speed of light**: $c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}$.

### Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor $\gamma$
The Lorentz factor is given by:
\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2}.
\]
Since $E = 27 \, \text{GeV}$ and $m c^2 = 3.41 \, \text{GeV}$, we find:
\[
\gamma = \frac{27}{3.41} \approx 7.9178.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the lab-frame lifetime $\tau$
The lab-frame lifetime is dilated due to special relativity:
\[
\tau = \gamma \tau_0.
\]
Substituting $\gamma \approx 7.9178$ and $\tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s}$:
\[
\tau = 7.9178 \times 8 \times 10^{-16} \approx 6.334 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the velocity $\beta c$
The velocity $\beta$ is related to $\gamma$ by:
\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}.
\]
Substituting $\gamma \approx 7.9178$:
\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(7.9178)^2}} \approx \sqrt{1 - 0.01595} \approx \sqrt{0.98405} \approx 0.9920.
\]
Thus, the velocity is:
\[
v = \beta c \approx 0.9920 \times 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \approx 2.976 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the average decay length $L$
The average decay length is:
\[
L = v \tau.
\]
Substituting $v \approx 2.976 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}$ and $\tau \approx 6.334 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{s}$:
\[
L = (2.976 \times 10^8) \times (6.334 \times 10^{-15}) \approx 1.885 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 5: Determine the minimum resolution $\delta$
To observe at least 30% of the decays, we need the minimum resolution $\delta$ such that:
\[
P(L > \delta) \geq 0.3.
\]
The probability of a decay occurring beyond $\delta$ is given by:
\[
P(L > \delta) = e^{-\delta / L}.
\]
Setting $P(L > \delta) = 0.3$:
\[
e^{-\delta / L} = 0.3 \implies -\frac{\delta}{L} = \ln(0.3) \implies \delta = -L \ln(0.3).
\]
Using $\ln(0.3) \approx -1.20397$:
\[
\delta = L \times 1.20397 \approx (1.885 \times 10^{-6}) \times 1.20397 \approx 2.269 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 6: Compare with the options
The calculated minimum resolution $\delta \approx 2.269 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}$ is closest to option **A) $2.08 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}$**, which is likely rounded or approximated.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: A**
