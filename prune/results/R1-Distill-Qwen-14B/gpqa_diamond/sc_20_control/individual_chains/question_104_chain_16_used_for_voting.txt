Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm. Let me try to think it through.

Alright, the question says that two stars with the same mass are being observed. Each has a planet similar to Neptune. The planets are in circular orbits, and the detection is done using the radial velocity (RV) method. 

The key points given are the shifts in the spectral lines. Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, I remember that the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines due to the planet's gravitational pull. The formula I think is related to the velocity semi-amplitude, K. The shift in wavelength is proportional to the velocity, so the larger the shift, the higher the velocity K.

The formula for the Doppler shift (wavelength shift) is delta_lambda / lambda = v / c, where v is the velocity and c is the speed of light. So the shift is proportional to the velocity.

But wait, in the RV method, the velocity semi-amplitude K is what's measured. So if Planet #1 has a 5 mA shift and Planet #2 has a 7 mA, that means K1 is 5 and K2 is 7, assuming the same lambda for both measurements. Since the stars are the same mass, their spectral lines are at the same rest wavelength, so the shift is directly proportional to K.

The RV formula relates K to the mass of the planet, the star's mass, and the orbital period. The formula I'm trying to recall is the one for the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity:

K = [ (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * [ (1) / ( (1 + (M_planet / M_star))^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) ) ]

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the simplified version when M_planet << M_star, which it is, since Neptune is much less massive than the Sun-like star. So M_planet / M_star is negligible, so we can approximate.

The simplified formula for K when M_planet << M_star is:

K ≈ ( (2π G ) / (c P ) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )

But since the orbits are circular, e is 0, so the denominator becomes 1. Also, sin i is approx 1 because the planets are likely close to edge-on (but the question doesn't specify, so maybe it's a given that i=90 degrees, so sin i=1).

So K ≈ (2π G / c P )^(1/3) * (M_planet) / (M_star)^(2/3)

Wait, that seems complicated. Alternatively, another approach is using the formula that relates velocity amplitude K to the mass function and the period.

But perhaps for a given star mass, the K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period. Because from the formula, K is proportional to (M_p) / (P^(1/3) * M_star^(2/3)) )

Wait, but the stars are the same, so M_star is same for both. And the planets have similar masses (both Neptune-like), so M_p is same. So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3).

So if K1 and K2 are 5 and 7, then K1/K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3) ?

Wait, no. Because if K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3) ?

Wait, let me make it clearer. Let's say K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3). So K1 = C / P1^(1/3), K2 = C / P2^(1/3), where C is a constant.

Taking the ratio K1/K2 = (C / P1^(1/3)) / (C / P2^(1/3)) ) = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

So rearranged,

(K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

We can solve for (P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^3

Wait wait, no. Let me double-check:

If K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3), then K = constant / P^(1/3), so P = (constant / K)^3.

So P2 = (constant / K2)^3, P1 = (constant / K1)^3.

So P2 / P1 = ( (constant/K2)^3 ) / ( (constant/K1)^3 ) ) = (K1/K2)^3.

So (P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, but K1 is 5, K2 is 7. So K1/K2 = 5/7 ≈ 0.714.

So (P2/P1) = (5/7)^3 = (125)/(343) ≈ 0.364.

Hmm, so P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of Planet #1.

Wait wait, but the question is how many times longer is Planet #2's period compared to Planet #1. So if P2 is 0.36 P1, it's shorter. So the ratio would be P2/P1 = ~0.36, but the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1. So that would be 0.36 times as long, so the answer is 0.36 times, which is option A.

Wait but let me check the math again. Let me write down the steps:

Given that K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)

So K1/K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3)

So (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So (P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^3

K1 is 5, K2 is7. So (5/7)^3 = (5^3)/(7^3) = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3 → P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So the period of planet #2 is shorter than planet #1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? That is, P2/P1 = 0.364, so it's about 0.36 times as long; meaning it's shorter by a factor of ~0.36. So the answer would be option A, 0.36.

Wait, but why would a larger K mean a shorter period? Because if the star is moving faster (higher velocity K), that can happen if the planet is either more massive or closer in (shorter period, because higher orbital velocity), right? Because for a given mass, a shorter period (closer orbit) would result in a higher K. So in this case, planet #2 has a higher K (7 vs 5), so it must have a shorter period. So P2 is shorter than P1, so the ratio P2/P1 is less than 1, which aligns with 0.36.

But looking back at the options, option A is ~0.36, which is the same as I got. So the answer should be A.

Wait, let me think again. The formula says that a larger K implies a smaller period. So if K increases, P decreases. So if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 is smaller than P1. So the ratio P2/P1 is (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.364, which is about 0.36. So the answer is A.

The question involves determining how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, given that both planets are detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines, which is proportional to the velocity semi-amplitude \( K \). The relationship between \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \) is given by:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

This implies:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Rearranging for \( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

From the problem, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of Planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, the answer is approximately 0.36.

K = [ (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * [ (1) / ( (1 + (M_planet / M_star))^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) ) ]

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the simplified version when M_planet << M_star, which it is, since Neptune is much less massive than the Sun-like star. So M_planet / M_star is negligible, so we can approximate.

The simplified formula for K when M_planet << M_star is:

K ≈ ( (2π G ) / (c P ) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )

But since the orbits are circular, e is 0, so the denominator becomes 1. Also, sin i is approx 1 because the planets are likely close to edge-on (but the question doesn't specify, so maybe it's a given that i=90 degrees, so sin i=1).

But perhaps for a given star mass, the K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period. Because from the formula, K is proportional to (M_p) / (P^(1/3) * M_star^(2/3)) )

Wait, but the stars are the same, so M_star is same for both. And the planets have similar masses (both Neptune-like), so M_p is same. So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3).

So if K1 and K2 are 5 and 7, then K1/K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3) ?

Wait, no. Because if K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3) ?

Wait, let me make it clearer. Let's say K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3). So K1 = C / P1^(1/3), K2 = C / P2^(1/3), where C is a constant.

Taking the ratio K1/K2 = (C / P1^(1/3)) / (C / P2^(1/3)) ) = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

So rearranged,

(K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

We can solve for (P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^3

Wait wait, no. Let me double-check:

If K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3), then K = constant / P^(1/3), so P = (constant / K)^3.

So P2 = (constant / K2)^3, P1 = (constant / K1)^3.

So P2 / P1 = ( (constant/K2)^3 ) / ( (constant/K1)^3 ) ) = (K1/K2)^3.

So (P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, but K1 is 5, K2 is 7. So K1/K2 = 5/7 ≈ 0.714.

So (P2/P1) = (5/7)^3 = (125)/(343) ≈ 0.364.

Hmm, so P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of Planet #1.

Wait wait, but the question is how many times longer is Planet #2's period compared to Planet #1. So if P2 is 0.36 P1, it's shorter. So the ratio would be P2/P1 = ~0.36, but the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1. So that would be 0.36 times as long, so the answer is 0.36 times, which is option A.

Wait but let me check the math again. Let me write down the steps:

Given that K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)

So K1/K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3)

So (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So (P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^3

K1 is 5, K2 is7. So (5/7)^3 = (5^3)/(7^3) = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3 → P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So the period of planet #2 is shorter than planet #1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? That is, P2/P1 = 0.364, so it's about 0.36 times as long; meaning it's shorter by a factor of ~0.36. So the answer would be option A, 0.36.

Wait, but why would a larger K mean a shorter period? Because if the star is moving faster (higher velocity K), that can happen if the planet is either more massive or closer in (shorter period, because higher orbital velocity), right? Because for a given mass, a shorter period (closer orbit) would result in a higher K. So in this case, planet #2 has a higher K (7 vs 5), so it must have a shorter period. So P2 is shorter than P1, so the ratio P2/P1 is less than 1, which aligns with 0.36.

But looking back at the options, option A is ~0.36, which is the same as I got. So the answer should be A.

Wait, let me think again. The formula says that a larger K implies a smaller period. So if K increases, P decreases. So if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 is smaller than P1. So the ratio P2/P1 is (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.364, which is about 0.36. So the answer is A.

The RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines, which is proportional to the velocity semi-amplitude \( K \). The relationship between \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \) is given by:

\[

Rearranging for \( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

From the problem, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364

Thus, the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of Planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, the answer is approximately 0.36.
