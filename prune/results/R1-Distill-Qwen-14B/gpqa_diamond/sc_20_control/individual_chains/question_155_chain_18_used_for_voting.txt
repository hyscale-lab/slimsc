Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about uncertainty in the P_z operator. Let me try to think through it step by step. 

First, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable, like P_z, is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). So I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared in the given state.

The state of the system is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). I think this is a three-component vector, so it's in a three-dimensional space. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which makes sense because the matrix for P_z is diagonal in this basis. That should make things easier for calculations.

Wait, the basis being the eigenvectors of P_z means that the state vector is expressed in terms of |ψ> = a|+> + b|0> + c|->, where |+>, |0>, |-> are the eigenstates of P_z. But in this case, the state is given as a column vector [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]^T. So each component corresponds to the eigenstates of P_z.

So the first component is for P_z = +ħ, the second is P_z = 0, and third is P_z = -ħ. Right? Let me make sure: looking at P_z's matrix, it's diagonal with entries ħ, 0, -ħ. So yeah, the first basis vector is the eigenstate for +ħ, the second for 0, and third for -ħ.

The state vector ψ is then ψ = (-1/2) |+> + (1/sqrt(2)) |0> + (-1/2) |->. So in terms of the components, the first entry is coefficient of |+>, second of |0>, third of |->.

Now, to find the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩, I can compute the sum over the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues. Because in the basis of P_z, the expectation is straightforward.

So the probabilities are the squares of the absolute values of the components. Let's calculate that.

First component: (-1/2). The probability is | -1/2 |² = 1/4. Multiply by its eigenvalue, which is ħ. So (1/4) * ħ.

Second component: (1/sqrt(2)). Probability is (1/√2)^2 = 1/2. Multiply by eigenvalue 0, so this term is zero.

Third component: (-1/2). Probability is again 1/4, multiplied by eigenvalue -ħ. So (1/4)* (-ħ).

Adding them together: (1/4 ħ) + 0 + (-1/4 ħ) = 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Hmm, that's interesting. So the expectation of P_z is zero.

Now, what about ⟨P_z²⟩? Since P_z is diagonal in this basis, P_z² is just the square of each diagonal element. So the eigenvalues for P_z² are (ħ)^2, 0^2, (-ħ)^2 → all ħ², 0, ħ².

So the expectation value ⟨P_z²⟩ is the sum of probabilities times the squared eigenvalues.

First component: (1/4) * (ħ²) = ħ²/4.

Second component: (1/2) * 0 = 0.

Third component: (1/4) * (ħ²) = ħ²/4.

Adding them together: ħ²/4 + 0 + ħ²/4 = ħ²/2.

So now, ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²) = sqrt( (ħ²/2) - (0)^2 ) = sqrt( ħ²/2 ) = (ħ) / sqrt(2).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2), which matches this result. So the uncertainty should be option B.

But wait a second, let me double-check the state vector. The components are (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let me calculate the sum of squares to make sure it's normalized.

(-1/2)^2 = 1/4, (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2, (-1/2)^2=1/4. Sum is 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 1. So yes, it's normalized.

Another check: since the state is an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ, but we're being asked about P_z. The uncertainty in P_z is not zero because the state is not an eigenstate of P_z. So the uncertainty should be finite, which it is.

Wait, what's the matrix for P_z? It's diagonal, so I can compute it directly. So for the state vector ψ, ⟨P_z⟩ is ψ† P_z ψ. Let's do it matrix-wise to confirm.

P_z matrix is:
[ ħ, 0, 0;
0, 0, 0;
0, 0,-ħ ]

The state vector is a column vector, let's call it ψ = [ -1/2; 1/sqrt(2); -1/2 ]

So ψ† P_z ψ is the dot product of ψ with P_z ψ.

Compute P_z ψ: 

Each component:

First component: ħ*(-1/2) + 0*(1/sqrt(2)) + 0*(-1/2) = -ħ/2.

Second component: 0*(-1/2) + 0*(1/sqrt(2)) + 0*(-1/2) = 0.

Third component: 0*(-1/2) + 0*(1/sqrt(2)) + (-ħ)*(-1/2) = ħ/2.

So P_z ψ = [ -ħ/2, 0, ħ/2 ]^T.

Now, the inner product ψ† (P_z ψ) is the sum of ψ_i * (P_z ψ)_i.

Which is (-1/2)*(-ħ/2) + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + (-1/2)*(ħ/2).

Calculating each term:

First term: (1/2)(ħ/2) = ħ/4.

Second term: 0.

Third term: (-1/2)(ħ/2) = -ħ/4.

Summing: ħ/4 - ħ/4 = 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ is indeed zero. That's consistent.

Now, for ⟨P_z²⟩, we can compute it as ψ† P_z² ψ.

P_z squared would have eigenvalues squared. So the diagonal matrix would be:

[ (ħ)^2, 0, 0;
0, 0, 0;
0, 0, (−ħ)^2 ] → same as [ ħ², 0, 0; ... ].

So P_z squared is:

[ ħ², 0, 0;
0, 0, 0;
0,0, ħ² ]

Multiply P_z² by ψ:

P_z² ψ = [ ħ²*(-1/2), 0*(1/sqrt(2)), ħ²*(-1/2) ] = [ -ħ²/2, 0, -ħ²/2 ].

Wait no, wait. Because P_z² is a diagonal matrix. So for each component:

First component: ħ² * (-1/2) = - ħ²/2.

Second component: 0 * (1/sqrt(2)) = 0.

Third component: ħ² * (-1/2) = - ħ²/2.

Wait, no. Wait, actually, when you multiply a diagonal matrix by a vector, each component is the diagonal element multiplied by the corresponding vector component.

So ψ is [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ].

So P_z² ψ is [ (ħ²)(-1/2), (0)(1/sqrt(2)), (ħ²)(-1/2) ] → that would be [ -ħ²/2, 0, -ħ²/2 ].

Wait, but that seems a bit odd. Because actually, when you square P_z, the eigenvalues would be squared, so for each component, the eigenvalue is squared. So for the first component, the original eigenvalue was +ħ. So squared is ħ².

So when you multiply P_z squared by ψ, it's [ ħ² * (-1/2), 0 * (1/sqrt(2)), ħ² * (-1/2) ], which is [ -ħ²/2, 0, -ħ²/2 ].

Then, ψ† (P_z² ψ) is the sum of ψ_i * (P_z² ψ)_i.

So let me compute each term:

First term: (-1/2) * (-ħ²/2) = (1/2)(ħ²/2) = ħ²/4.

Second term: (1/sqrt(2)) * 0 = 0.

Third term: (-1/2) * (-ħ²/2) = (1/2)(ħ²/2) = ħ²/4.

Total is ħ²/4 + 0 + ħ²/4 = ħ²/2. So yes, same as earlier. So ⟨P_z²⟩ is ħ²/2.

So ΔP_z is sqrt( ħ²/2 - 0 ) = sqrt( ħ²/2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2). So option B.

Wait, but wait a moment. I just thought about whether the state is an eigenstate of P_x. The question says it's an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. Let me check if that makes sense. Because sometimes, the expectation values of other observables can be zero or something else.

But in this problem, we're only being asked about the uncertainty in P_z, so that's why we went through the calculations as above. So I think the answer is option B, which is ħ/sqrt(2).

To calculate the uncertainty in \( P_z \), we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Expectation value of \( P_z \)
The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of \( P_z \), with eigenvalues \( +\hbar, 0, -\hbar \). The expectation value \( \langle P_z \rangle \) is calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \sum_i |c_i|^2 \lambda_i,
\]

where \( |c_i|^2 \) are the probabilities (squares of the absolute values of the components of \( \psi \)) and \( \lambda_i \) are the eigenvalues of \( P_z \). The probabilities are:

\[
|c_1|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad |c_2|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad |c_3|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( P_z \) are \( +\hbar, 0, -\hbar \). Thus:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4}(\hbar) + \frac{1}{2}(0) + \frac{1}{4}(-\hbar) = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Expectation value of \( P_z^2 \)
The eigenvalues of \( P_z^2 \) are the squares of the eigenvalues of \( P_z \), which are \( \hbar^2, 0, \hbar^2 \). The expectation value \( \langle P_z^2 \rangle \) is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \sum_i |c_i|^2 \lambda_i^2.
\]

Substituting the probabilities and eigenvalues:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4}(\hbar^2) + \frac{1}{2}(0) + \frac{1}{4}(\hbar^2) = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Uncertainty in \( P_z \)
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{2} \) and \( \langle P_z \rangle = 0 \):

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty in \( P_z \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}} \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
