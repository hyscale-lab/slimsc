Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using its spectral data. The techniques used are FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options given are four different chemical formulas, all with six carbons but varying hydrogens and oxygen counts.

Alright, let's break down each part of the data.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks around that region usually indicate O-H stretches, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, the problem says it's a very broad peak. Oh right, carboxylic acids have a very broad O-H stretch because they're more acidic and can form hydrogen bonds more extensively. Alcohols have a broad peak too, but maybe a bit less so. Hmm, not sure yet, but I'll keep that in mind.

Then there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 region is typical for carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, or esters. The 1650 peak might be from conjugated carbonyl groups or possibly an aromatic ring with some sort of substitution. Wait, could it be an ester? Because esters usually have a carbonyl around 1700-1750. Also, sometimes conjugated carbonyls might show a peak a bit lower, like around 1680 or 1650. Alternatively, that 1650 could be an aromatic C=C stretch, but that's usually around 1600. Hmm, not sure yet.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound likely has a double bond, maybe part of a ring or a substituent.

Then, the mass spec shows a fragment peak at m/z=45. I need to think about what fragments give 45. Common fragments include CH3O (which is 31, but maybe combined with something else?), but wait, 45 could be something like CH2CH2O (but that's 44?), or perhaps a methyl ester group. Wait, another possibility: the molecular ion breaking into a smaller fragment. For example, if the compound is an ester, like RCOOR', the loss of the R' group (like ethyl) might leave behind a fragment. Alternatively, maybe the molecular formula can help with this.

Now, looking at the options:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

The formulas are:

A: C6H12O2 → Degree of unsaturation would be (2*6 +2 -12 -2*2)/2 = (14-12-4)/2= (-2)/2? Wait wait, formula is Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N here: DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 - 2*0)/2 = (14 -12)/2= 1. So one degree: could be a ring, a double bond, etc.

But wait, for C6H12O2, let's compute:

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 - 0)/2 → (14-12)/2=1. So one DoU. So possible structures could be a ring plus an ester, or a double bond and an ester, etc.

Option B: C6H10O → DoU = (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees: could be two rings, a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

Option C: C6H10O2 → DoU=(14 -10 -2*2)/2 = (14-10-4)/2=0/2=0? Wait, wait, perhaps I should recalculate. Wait, formula is DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So for C6H10O2: 2*6=12 +2=14. Minus H (10) and X (0) → 14-10=4. Divide by 2: 2. So DoU is 2. So two degrees of unsaturation. Could be a ring and a double bond, or two rings, etc.

Option D: C6H12O → DoU=(14 -12)/2=1. So one degree.

Now, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which suggests a double bond (so at least one DoU). So the compound must have at least a double bond.

Looking at the options:

A: DoU=1 → so either a ring or a double bond. Since the NMR has vinyl, it's a double bond.
B: DoU=2 → could be two rings, a ring and a double bond, etc.
C: DoU=2 → same as B.
D: DoU=1 → again, could be a ring or double bond, but since the NMR shows double bond, it's the double bond.

So the IR has a peak at 1700 and 1650. Let's think about what that could mean. If the compound has a carbonyl, like an ester or ketone.

Ester carbonyl is around 1700-1750. So the 1700 peak could be an ester. What about the 1650? That might be from a conjugated group, like an aromatic ring, but the compound is C6H... So maybe it's a cyclohexene ring with an ester group.

Wait, another thought: if it's an ester, the structure could be something like an ester linked to a cyclic ether? Or perhaps a substituted ester with a double bond.

But let's think about the possible functional groups based on the IR. A broad peak at 3000 suggests an O-H or maybe an alcohol, but in this case, the presence of a carbonyl and possibly an ester.

Wait, but if the 3000 is a broad peak, maybe it's a carboxylic acid. But then, the carbonyl would be around 1700, and the O-H would be broad and strong. But if it's an ester, the O-H would be from an alcohol or something else?

Alternatively, maybe it's an ester with an alcohol group. Like, for example, a cyclic ester (lactone) with an OH group. Or maybe a diol ester? Not sure.

Hmm, but the problem says the FTIR has a very broad peak, which is more like a carboxylic acid. Because alcohols' O-H are usually less broad but could be broad if in a cyclic structure or something. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, maybe the O-H is from a phenol. Phenols have broad O-H stretches, around 3000-3500 cm^-1. But then, the other peaks at 1700 and 1650. So could the compound be a phenol with an ester group? Possible.

But wait, the mass spec shows a fragment at 45. Let's think about that.

Possible fragments at 45 could be (CH3)2O (which is 45? Let me compute: C2H6O → 12*2 + 6 +16=24+6+16=46. No, that's 46. Not 45. Alternatively, methyl group plus something else. Wait, 45 could be (CH3)CO, which is 45? Let's see: (12*1)+(3*1)+12 +16 +16? No, wait, (CH3)CO is 45? Let me compute: C2H5O? Hmm, 2*12 +5 +16=24+5+16=45. Oh wait, that's C2H5O, but that is not a stable fragment. Hmm, maybe it's a CH2O group (formaldehyde, 30), but that's not 45. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from CH2CH2O... No, that's 44. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula. Let's look at each option's possible molecular weight.

But wait, the fragment is at 45, so perhaps the molecular ion breaks into a fragment of 45. Let me think about each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. Molecular weight is (6×12)+(12×1)+(2×16)=72+12+32=116. If the molecular ion is at 116, but the fragment is 45. So perhaps, the molecule breaks into a 45 and 71 (116-45=71). Hmm, but 71 is a common fragment for something else. Not sure.

Option C: C6H10O2. Molecular weight would be (6×12)+(10×1)+(2×16)=72+10+32=114. So fragment at 45 would imply another part of 69. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the molecular formula is such that a certain functional group breaks off. For example, if the compound is an ester, R-O-CO-R'. The ester group might break into the R-O- and the CO-R' part. Alternatively, the carbonyl group could fragment. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Let me think about the possible structures for each option.

Option C: C6H10O2. That's 6 carbons, 10 hydrogens, 2 oxygens. Let's see possible structures. Maybe a cyclic ester, like a lactone. A six-membered ring would have a carbonyl group. So if it's a six-membered ring, like gamma or delta lactone. Gamma would have five carbons in the ring plus the ester. Hmm, perhaps. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituted ester with a double bond.

Wait, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond. So for C6H10O2, which has DoU=2. The double bond is one DoU, and another could be a ring or another double bond. Alternatively, a carbonyl group (which is a DoU). So maybe an ester group (which would account for the O and the carbonyl) and a double bond.

So, possible structure: a cyclohexene ring with an ester group attached. Or perhaps a vinyl ester, like an ester with a double bond.

Wait, another thought: a vinyl ester would have the structure CH2=CHCOOR. For example, if R is methyl, that would be CH2=CHCOOCH3. The molecular formula would be C5H8O2. But our options are C6H10O2, which is two more carbons and two more hydrogens. Maybe a longer chain.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a diester or something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted benzene ring. But I don't see any aromatic peaks in the IR, only the peaks around 1650, which could be C=C in a ring or something else.

Wait, the IR has a peak at 1650. If that's a carbonyl, perhaps conjugated. Or maybe an aromatic ring with substituents causing a shift in the C=C stretch.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should focus more on the mass spec.

A fragment at 45. Let me think about possible structures that would produce 45.

Another thought: 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)CO, which is 45 (12 + 16 + 2*12 + 2*1) ? Wait, no. Let's compute: CH3CO is (12*2) + (3*1) + (16) → 24 +3 +16=43. Hmm, not 45. Or maybe (CH2)2CO → 12*3 + 2*2 +16=36+4+16=56. No, that's higher.

Wait, 45 could be (CH3)COO- (which would be 45?), but that's 12*2 + 16*2 +3 = 24 +32 +3=59. No, that's higher. Alternatively, maybe a methyl group attached to something else.

Wait, maybe it's the tropylium ion (C7H7+), but that's 91. Hmm, not relevant.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a ketene group (O=C=O), but that's a different story. Or maybe the fragment is from an ester cleavage.

Wait, another approach: considering the molecular formula of each option, what's the possible structure that would lose a fragment of 45?

Option C: C6H10O2. If the molecular weight is 114, a fragment of 45 would imply a loss of 114 -45=69. Hmm, 69 is a common mass for something like CH2CH2COOCH3? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is an ester with a cyclopentyl group or something. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the molecular formula for option C is C6H10O2. Let me think about the ester formula. Esters are RCOOR'. So, the formula would be (CnH2nO2) for RCOOR', assuming R is Cn-1H2n-1 and R' is CmH2m-1O.

Wait, not exactly. Let me compute. Suppose R is CxHy, R' is CzHw. Then RCOOR' → (x+ z + 2) C, (2x + w + 2) H, and O: 2.

Wait, perhaps I should think of an example. Let's say R is CH2CH2CH2 (n=3), so RCOO is C4H7O2. Then R' would be, say, methyl (CH3), making RCOOR' as C4H7O2 + C1H3 → C5H10O2.

But our option C is C6H10O2. So maybe R is C3H5, RCOO is C4H5O2, and R' is C2H5. Then RCOOR' would be C6H10O2. That works.

So the structure would be something like (CH2CH2CH2)COO(CH2CH2CH3). Wait, no, that's not matching. Alternatively, the R could be C4H7 and R' C2H5. Let me compute: R is C4H7, RCOO is C5H7O2. R' is C2H5, so RCOOR' is C7H12O2. No, that's too big.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible structures that would give a fragment of 45.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment could be a ketene ion (O=C=O), but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the fragment could be a methyl group attached to something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound has an acetyloxy group (OAc), which is (COCH3). The molecular weight of OAc is 59 (12+16 +12+3=59). Not 45.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a CH2CH2O group. Let's see: (CH2)2O is 12*2 + 1*4 +16=24+4+16=44. Close, but not exactly 45.

Another thought: Maybe the compound is a diethyl acetal or something similar, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from the loss of an ethyl group (45? Let's compute: C2H5 is 29. So 116 (the molecular weight of option A) minus 29 is 87, not 45. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: what if the unknown is a cyclic ester (lactone). So for example, a gamma-lactone would have five carbons in the ring plus the ester oxygen. But let's see, the molecular formula for a gamma-lactone would be C5H8O2. Hmm, but our options are C6H10O2 (option C) and others. So maybe a delta-lactone, which is a six-membered ring. The formula would be C5H8O2? Wait, delta is five-membered? Or maybe I'm getting that wrong. Lactones are classified by the number of carbons between the ester oxygen and the carbonyl. Gamma is four, making a five-membered ring. So for a six-membered ring, it's a delta-lactone, which would have five carbons between oxygen and carbonyl, making a six-membered ring. So the formula would be C5H8O2. But our option is C6H10O2. So maybe not a simple lactone.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an ester with a double bond. For example, something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. Let me compute the formula: CH2=CHCOO is C3H4O2, and CH2CH2CH3 is C3H7. So together, C6H11O2. But the formula is C6H10O2, which is one H less. Hmm, maybe a substituent is different.

But perhaps I'm getting off track. Let me go back to the other clues.

The FTIR has a broad peak at 3000. That's likely an O-H stretch. If it's an ester, then perhaps there's also an alcohol group present. But that would require a diol ester or something else. Alternatively, maybe the compound is a carboxylic acid, but then the ester would be unlikely. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: maybe the compound is a ketone. The IR would show a peak around 1700 for the ketone. But then, the broad peak at 3000 might be an alcohol. So the compound could have both a ketone and an alcohol group. But looking at the options, the formulas with two oxygens (options A and C) could have both a ketone and an alcohol. Or perhaps not.

But the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond, which is another DoU. So for option C (DoU=2), a double bond and a ring or another group.

Wait, perhaps it's a cyclic ketone with a double bond. But then the IR would show a peak around 1700 for the ketone and perhaps another peak for the conjugation. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's an ester with a conjugated double bond, which would lower the carbonyl peak to around 1650. Hmm, that might make sense. So the 1700 peak is from the ester, and the 1650 is from the conjugated double bond. So the structure would have both an ester and a double bond. So that would fit with the IR data.

So, putting that together, the compound is likely an ester with a double bond. So the structure could be something like CH2=CHCOOR or similar.

Now, considering the mass spec. If the compound breaks into a fragment with m/z=45, that could be a part of the ester group. For example, the ester group (COOR) might break off as a fragment. The COOR group would have a molecular weight of (12 + 16 + R's molecular weight). But wait, R is an alkyl group.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is the acylium ion. For example, RCOO+ would have a mass equal to RCOO. For R=CH2CH2, RCOO would be CH2CH2COO → (12*3)+(2*5)+16=36+10+16=62. Not 45.

Hmm. Alternative approach: the fragment at 45 could be the methyl group plus something. Or maybe it's a CH3CO+ ion, which would be 43? Not 45. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2CH2O+ group, which would be 44. Still not 45.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment is a CH2CH2O group, but that's 44, as I thought before. Close but not exactly 45.

Wait, maybe the fragment is (CH3)COO- which would be 45? Let me compute the molecular weight. (CH3)COO is (12*2) + (3*1) + (16*2) = 24 +3 +32=59. No, that's higher.

Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2CH2CO+ fragment. That's 12*3 + 2*5 → 36 +10=46. Not 45. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a CH2CH2O group (44) and it's losing a hydrogen, but not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the molecular formula is C6H10O2 (option C), which would have a molecular weight of 114. If the fragment at m/z=45 is part of the molecule, then the rest would be 114-45=69. Hmm, 69 could be a fragment like CH2CH2COOCH2CH2, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a diethyl maleate or something similar. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the possible structures for each option again.

Option C: C6H10O2. If it's an ester, the formula would be RCOOR', where R and R' are alkyl groups. RCOOR' has the formula Cn+ m+2 H 2(n + m +1) O2. So for C6H10O2, n + m +2 =6 → n + m=4.

And 2(n + m +1) =10 → n + m +1=5 → n + m=4, which matches. So n + m=4. So possible R and R' could be:

R could be methyl (n=1), R' would be propyl (m=3): RCOO R' → CH3COOCH2CH2CH2CH3. Wait, that would be C5H10O2. No, because n=1, m=3: 1+3=4. So RCOOR' would be (n+1) + (m+1) = 2+4=6 carbons. So yes, that would fit. So the formula would be C6H12O2, but our option is C6H10O2. Hmm, maybe a double bond.

Wait, if the ester is from a substituted acid and an alcohol, perhaps with a double bond. For example, R could be CH2CH2CH2CH2 (but wait, that's four carbons, not sure), but this is getting a bit complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an ester with a double bond, like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. Let's compute the formula: CH2=CHCOO is C3H4O2, and CH2CH2CH3 is C3H7. So together, C6H11O2. But our option is C6H10O2. Hmm, one less hydrogen. Maybe a substituent is different.

Wait, but we have the NMR showing vinyl hydrogens, meaning the double bond is present.

Now, back to the mass spec. If the molecular ion is at 114 (for option C), and a fragment is at 45, what could that be? Perhaps the ester group is breaking off. So the ester group (RCOO-) would have a molecular weight of (n+1)*12 + (2n+1)*1 + 2*16. Wait, R is (n+1) carbons, so RCOO is (n+2) carbons, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester group breaks into a smaller fragment. Let's think: for an ester RCOOR', the cleavage could occur at the carbonyl group, leading to RCO+ and R'O-.

Wait, RCO+ would have a molecular weight of (n+1)*12 + (2n+1)*1 + 16. For example, if R is methyl (n=1), RCO+ would be 43 (CH3CO+ is 43). But we have a fragment at 45. Hmm, close but not exactly.

Alternatively, if R is ethyl (n=2), RCO+ would be 55 (C3H5O+ → 3*12 +5 +16=36+5+16=57. No, that's higher than 45.

Hmm. Another approach: perhaps the fragment is from the loss of a larger group. For instance, if the molecule is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3, but that's getting too long.

Wait, another thought: if the molecular formula is C6H10O2, the degree of unsaturation is 2. So, two rings, or a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, or a triple bond and a ring, etc.

Since the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, there's a double bond. So DoU=1 from the double bond, and another from a ring (DoU=2). So the structure could be a cyclic ester with a double bond. Or an ester in a ring with a double bond.

Wait, if it's a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond, would that fit?

A gamma-lactone is a five-membered ring (so four carbons in the ring plus the ester). Let's see: the formula would be C5H8O2. But our option is C6H10O2. So maybe a six-membered ring (delta-lactone) with another substituent, like a methyl group. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclopropane ring, but that's less likely.

Wait, another thought: the presence of a broad peak at 3000 cm^-1 suggests an O-H group. So if the compound has both an ester and an -OH group, that would explain the O-H in the IR.

So the structure could be something like a substituted ester with an alcohol group. For example, a compound with both an ester and an alcohol, like an esterified alcohol.

Wait, but how would that structure look? Maybe a structure where the ester is attached to a cyclopropane ring with an -OH group.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a diol ester, but that might require more oxygens.

Wait, but the options only have two oxygens. So if it's an ester and an alcohol, that would account for the two oxygens. So for example, a molecule with an ester group and an -OH group.

But then, the IR would show a broad O-H peak (from the alcohol) and the ester carbonyl around 1700. The 1650 peak could be from a conjugated double bond.

So, putting it all together, the structure would have an ester group, an alcohol group, and a double bond. But I'm not sure how that fits into the molecular formula.

Wait, but considering the mass spec again, the fragment of 45. Let me think: if the compound is an allyl ester. For example, an ester with an allyl group.

The structure could be CH2=CHCH2COOR. Let's compute the formula: the acid part is CH2=CHCH2COOH, which is C4H6O2. Then, if R is methyl (CH3), the ester would be CH2=CHCH2COOCH3. The formula would be C5H8O2. Not matching our options.

Wait, but option C is C6H10O2. So perhaps R is ethyl.

So, structure would be CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3. That's C6H10O2. Yes! Because the acid part is C4H6O2, and the alcohol is C2H5OH. Wait, no, ester is RCOOR', so R is CH2=CHCH2, R' is CH2CH3.

So the formula would be (CH2=CHCH2COO)(CH2CH3) → C4H6O2 + C2H5 → C6H11O2. But our option is C6H10O2. Hmm, one hydrogen less.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. Let's compute:

CH2=CHCOO → C3H4O2, and CH2CH2CH3 → C3H7. So total C6H11O2. Again, one H more than option C.

Hmm, perhaps the double bond is in a different position. Maybe CH2CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH2 something? No, that would be too long.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic structure with a double bond.

Wait, maybe the structure is a cyclic ester with a double bond, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a mono-ester with a double bond and an -OH group. For example, something like CH2=CHCH2CH2COOCH2OH. Wait, that would have more oxygens, which isn't the case here.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck here. Let me try to think differently. Let me look at each option and see which one fits the data.

Option A: C6H12O2. DoU=1. So either a ring or a double bond. The NMR shows a double bond, so it's a double bond. So the structure has a double bond and an ester group (since O is 2). But then, where's the O-H for the broad peak in IR? Because if it's an ester, then O-H would come from an alcohol, but that would require another oxygen. Wait, no—wait, esters are RCOOR', which have two oxygen atoms. So that accounts for the O in the formula. So where is the O-H? Unless the compound is a diol ester, but that requires more oxygens. So perhaps the O-H is from a phenol group, but the formula doesn't include that.

Wait, but if the compound has a carbonyl (ester) and an O-H (from an alcohol), but only two oxygens, that would mean the O-H comes from one of the oxygen in the ester? No, because esters are O-C-O. So the O-H would have to come from another group.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a cyclic hemiacetal or something, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, another angle: the presence of a broad peak at 3000 cm^-1 suggests an O-H group, perhaps in an alcohol or phenol. But since the FTIR also shows a peak at 1700, which is an ester or ketone. So perhaps the compound has both an ester group and an alcohol group.

So, let's think about a structure with both an ester and an alcohol. Such a compound would have the formula RCOOR' and an -OH group. But that would require three oxygens (ester has two, alcohol has one). But our options have at most two oxygens. So that's not possible. So that can't be.

Wait, that's a problem. If the compound has both an ester (two oxygens) and an alcohol (one oxygen), that would require three oxygens, but the options don't have that. So the O-H must be from another source.

Ah, perhaps it's a carboxylic acid. Because a carboxylic acid has a carbonyl (around 1700) and an O-H (very broad). So the FTIR data would fit a carboxylic acid. Then, the other peak at 1650 could be from a conjugated group, like a double bond.

So, the compound could be a substituted carboxylic acid with a double bond.

Now, let's check the options. For a carboxylic acid, the formula would be CxHyO2. Because the formula for a carboxylic acid is CnH2nO2.

So, looking at the options:

Option A: C6H12O2 → 2n=12 → n=6. So that's a hexanoic acid. But wait, hexanoic acid is CH3(CH2)4COOH. Its IR would show a broad O-H (carboxylic acid) and a peak around 1700 for the carbonyl.

But in the question, the FTIR has a peak at 1700 and 1650. So a carboxylic acid would have the 1700 peak, but what about the 1650? Maybe it's from a conjugated double bond. So the compound could be a substituted carboxylic acid with a double bond.

So, for example, pent-2-enoic acid: CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH. Its formula would be C5H8O2. But our options are C6H12O2, etc. So perhaps a six-carbon substituted acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something like CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOH. Formula is C6H10O2. Wait, that's option C. So the formula would be C6H10O2.

Wait, but the molecular weight of option C is 114. If the molecular ion is at 114, and a fragment is at 45, that would imply a loss of 69. Hmm.

But the structure of CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOH is C6H10O2, which matches option C. The IR would show a broad peak for the carboxylic acid O-H, a peak around 1700 for the carbonyl, and a peak around 1650 could be from the conjugated double bond.

But wait, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which would correspond to the double bond in the structure. So that fits.

But then, in the mass spec, why is there a fragment at 45? Let me think. The molecular formula is C6H10O2. If this breaks down, perhaps it loses a fragment. For example, the carboxylic acid group could break off as COOH, which would have a molecular weight of 46 (12+16*2 +1= 45? Wait, COOH is 12 +16*2 +1=45. Oh! So the COOH group would have a molecular weight of 45. So that would explain the fragment at m/z=45. Because when the molecular ion breaks, it could lose the COOH group, leaving a fragment of 45.

Wait, but wait. The molecular formula of the compound is C6H10O2. If it loses a COOH group (which is C1H2O2, molecular weight 45), then the remaining fragment would be C5H8O. The molecular weight would be 5*12 +8 +16 =60 +8 +16=84. But the question states that the fragment is at m/z=45, which would be the COOH group. But the molecular ion is at m/z=114. So the loss would be 114-45=69, which would be the rest of the molecule. Hmm, but that's just the way the fragmentation works; I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the COOH group stays intact, and another part breaks. Hmm, perhaps not.

But in any case, the structure I'm considering is a substituted carboxylic acid with a double bond. The formula would be C6H10O2, which is option C.

But wait, another point: the FTIR peak at 1650. Carboxylic acids typically have a carbonyl around 1700. If there's conjugation, like a double bond next to the carboxylic acid, the carbonyl peak would shift to a lower wavenumber, around 1680-1660. So 1650 would be a bit low, but possible with more conjugation.

So putting it all together:

- FTIR: Broad peak at 3000 (carboxylic acid O-H), 1700 (carbonyl), 1650 (conjugated double bond).
- 1H NMR: Vinyl protons (so double bond present).
- Mass spect: Fragment at 45 (COOH group, maybe).

So the compound is a substituted carboxylic acid with a double bond, formula C6H10O2, which is option C.

The question involves identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options provided are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. Here's the analysis:

### FTIR Analysis:
- A very broad absorption peak at **3000 cm⁻¹** suggests the presence of an O-H group, likely from a carboxylic acid due to the broad nature of the peak.
- A strong absorption at **1700 cm⁻¹** indicates a carbonyl group, consistent with a carboxylic acid or ester.
- A peak at **1650 cm⁻¹** could be due to a conjugated carbonyl group or a double bond.

### 1H NMR Analysis:
- Peaks corresponding to **vinyl hydrogens** indicate the presence of a double bond in the compound.

### Mass Spectrometry:
- A fragment peak at **m/z = 45** suggests the loss of a group with this molecular weight. A plausible candidate is the **COOH group** (carboxylic acid), which has a molecular weight of 45.

### Option Analysis:
1. **C6H12O2 (Option A)**:
   - Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = 1, which could correspond to a ring or a double bond.
   - However, the NMR data shows vinyl hydrogens, indicating a double bond. This option does not account for the broad O-H peak at 3000 cm⁻¹, as it lacks sufficient functional groups.

2. **C6H10O (Option B)**:
   - DoU = 2, which could correspond to a double bond and a ring.
   - The absence of a carbonyl group in this formula makes it inconsistent with the IR data showing a peak at 1700 cm⁻¹.

3. **C6H10O2 (Option C)**:
   - DoU = 2, which could correspond to a double bond and a ring.
   - This formula is consistent with the IR data (broad O-H peak at 3000 cm⁻¹, carbonyl at 1700 cm⁻¹, and conjugation at 1650 cm⁻¹), the NMR data (vinyl hydrogens), and the mass spectrometry data (fragment at m/z = 45, likely from the COOH group).

4. **C6H12O (Option D)**:
   - DoU = 1, which could correspond to a ring or a double bond.
   - The absence of a carbonyl group in this formula makes it inconsistent with the IR data.

### Conclusion:
The compound is most consistent with **C6H10O2**. The IR data supports the presence of a carboxylic acid group (broad O-H peak and carbonyl at 1700 cm⁻¹), the NMR data confirms the presence of a double bond (vinyl hydrogens), and the mass spectrometry data aligns with the loss of the COOH group (m/z = 45).
