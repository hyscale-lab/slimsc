Okay, so I've got this question about a quasar's spectrum and figuring out its comoving distance. Hmm, let me try to break it down.

The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at 790 nm in the near infrared and optical spectrum, and the flux drops below that. I remember that quasars often have emission lines, and sometimes when those lines are shifted, it can tell us something about the redshift of the object. Oh wait, the peak is at 790 nm, which is in the near infrared. But wait, I think the Lyman-alpha emission line is around 121 nm in the ultraviolet. If the peak is much longer, that suggests redshift.

Wait, but the peak here is about 790 nm. Let me think: if the rest wavelength is shorter, say 121 nm for Lyman-alpha, then the observed wavelength is longer, that's redshift. Let me see: the observed wavelength λ_obs = 790 nm. So the redshift z would be (λ_obs / λ_rest) - 1. So if the rest is 121 nm, z = (790/121) -1. Let me calculate that.

790 divided by 121 is approximately 6.5289. Subtract 1 gives z ≈5.5289. So about z=5.5. Hmm, that's a high redshift, meaning it's very far away.

Now, the question is about the comoving distance. The comoving distance depends on the cosmological parameters. The given parameters are the Hubble constant H0 =70 km/s/Mpc, matter density parameter Ωm =0.3, dark energy Ωλ=0.7, and the universe is flat (so Ωm + Ωλ =1, which they do here: 0.3 +0.7=1).

I remember that the comoving distance D_C is given by integrating from a=1 (today) to a=1/(1+z) of c/(a² H(a)) da, but wait, no, another way: the formula is D_C = (c/H0) * ∫(from 0 to z) [1/(sqrt(Ωm*(1+z')^3 + Ωλ*(1+z')^3*(1/(1+z'))^3? Wait, no, dark energy is a cosmological constant, so its density doesn't change with a. So the scale factor a is inversely proportional to (1+z'), so (1+z') = a0/a.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look up the formula for comoving distance in a flat Lambda-CDM universe. The comoving distance for a given redshift z is D_C = (c/H0) * ∫(0 to z) dz' / E(z'), where E(z') = sqrt( Ωm*(1+z')^3 + Ωr*(1+z')^4 + Ωλ )

Wait, but wait, in this case, Ωr (radiation density) is negligible because the redshift is high (z~5.5), but maybe I should include it? Or is it considered negligible? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think: the matter density is Ωm=0.3, dark energy Ωλ=0.7, and flat. So E(z) = sqrt( Ωm*(1+z)^3 + Ωλ ). Since Ωr is probably negligible, we can ignore it.

So the integrand is 1/(sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 + 0.7)). The integral is from 0 to z=5.5. Hmm, but integrating this by hand would take time, and I don't remember the exact value for z=5.5. I think for high redshifts, the comoving distance increases more rapidly.

Wait, but I remember approximate comoving distances for certain redshifts. For example, at z=1, D_C is about 2 Gpc, I think. At z=2, maybe around 4 Gpc. Wait, but wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, I think the actual comoving distance for z=1 is about 1.6 billion parsecs (about 1.6 Gpc) when H0 is 70, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use an approximation formula or a look-up table. Alternatively, I can think about the age of the universe at that redshift and use that to estimate the distance. But perhaps the better approach is to figure out the integral numerically or use a standard approximation.

Wait, another approach: I remember that for a flat universe with matter and dark energy (lambda), the comoving distance can be found using the formula:

D_C = (c / H0) * ∫(0 to z) dz' / sqrt(Ωm*(1+z')^3 + Ωλ)

Hmm. So, H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc. Let me convert H0 to units where c is in km/s and so on.

But maybe it's easier to compute in terms of the integral. Let me think: the integral is a dimensionless number, so D_C will be (c / H0) * integral.

Wait, c is approximately 3e5 km/s. H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc. So c/(H0) is (3e5)/(70) ≈ 4285.7 Mpc. So approximately 4285.7 Mpc, which is about 4.2857 Gpc.

So, D_C = 4285.7 * ∫ [dz' / sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 + 0.7)] from 0 to 5.5.

Now, the integral is the part that's tricky. Let me think about how to approximate it. Maybe I can use an online calculator or an approximation. Alternatively, I can recall that for z=5, the comoving distance is about 10 Gpc. Wait, no, maybe not. Let me think again.

Alternatively, I can use a standard approximation or refer to a table. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that for high z, dark energy starts to dominate, so the expansion accelerates, which makes the integral grow, but perhaps not as rapidly as matter dominated.

Wait, perhaps I can use the approximation for E(z) = sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3 + 0.7). For high z, (1+z)^3 is much larger than 0.7. So for z=5, (1+5)=6; 6^3 is 216. So 0.3 * 216 =64.8. 64.8 plus 0.7 is 65.5. sqrt(65.5) is about 8.09. So E(z) ≈ 8.09.

Wait, but let's think about it. Since E(z) is sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3 +0.7), and for z=5, (1+z)=6, so 0.3*(6^3)=0.3*216=64.8. Plus 0.7 is 65.5. So sqrt(65.5)=~8.09. So E(z) is about 8.09.

But the integral is from 0 to 5.5. Let me think: for each z' between 0 and 5.5, we have to compute 1/E(z') and sum up.

But perhaps we can approximate the integral using a few terms, like using the midpoint or trapezoidal method. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for standard integrals or tables.

Wait, perhaps I can remember that the comoving distance for z=5.5 is approximately 16 Gpc? No, wait, that seems too high because if the universe is accelerating, the comoving distance doesn't increase that fast. Wait, let me think again.

Alternatively, let me think about the age of the universe. The age at z=5.5 is roughly 1.1 billion years. Because, the age of the universe now is about 13.8 billion years. But wait, that's not directly helpful here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can recall that for z=1, the comoving distance is about 2 Gpc. For z=2, it's about 4 Gpc. For higher z, it grows but not linearly.

Wait, but wait: for z=5.5, if the comoving distance is around 16 Gpc, that would make option D (7 Gpc) too small. But the options are 6, 7, 8, 9 Gpc.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Maybe I should think about the luminosity distance, but the question is about comoving distance. Alternatively, perhaps the quasar is at a certain redshift, but the comoving distance is a function of that.

Wait, perhaps I can use the age of the universe and the Hubble parameter. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look up an approximate comoving distance calculator. Since I can't do that, I'll have to think of another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the luminosity distance and then relate it to comoving distance, but that might complicate things.

Wait, another approach: the comoving distance can be related to the recession velocity. The recession velocity v = H0 * D_C. But redshift z is related to the recession velocity via z = v/c for small z, but for high z, it's more accurate to use z = (1 + v/c) - 1, which isn't exactly correct, but perhaps for this purpose, it's enough.

Wait, but z is about 5.5, so this approach isn't accurate.

Alternatively, maybe I can use an online calculator or a standard formula for the integral.

Wait, perhaps I can approximate the integral using a Taylor expansion or using a substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps I can recall that for a flat universe with matter and dark energy, the comoving distance D_C for high redshifts can be approximated as D_C ≈ (c/H0) * (2/3) * (1 + (1 - q0)/2 z) ) / (1 + (1 + q0) z/2) )

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, the Friedmann equation's solution for a flat universe with matter and dark energy is a bit complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a table of comoving distances for various redshifts.

Wait, I think I've seen a table before. Let me see:

For H0 =70 km/s/Mpc, Omega_m=0.3, Omega_lambda=0.7.

Redshift | Comoving Distance (Gpc)
0 | 0
0.5 | ~1.5
1 | ~2.0
2 | ~3.3
3 | ~4.9
4 | ~6.5
5 | ~8.0
6 | ~9.2
So wait, wait, that can't be right because the comoving distance for z=5 is around 8 Gpc? Hmm, but that would mean the options are in that ballpark.

Wait, but wait, looking at the options, they're 6, 7, 8, 9 Gpc. So for z=5.5, perhaps the comoving distance is around 8-9 Gpc.

Wait, but according to this table, at z=5, D_C is about 8 Gpc, and at z=6, about 9.2 Gpc. So for z=5.5, it's in between, around 8.5-9 Gpc.

Wait, but the options are 6, 7, 8, 9. So 9 Gpc is an option (option C), but wait, wait, according to the table I just thought of, at z=5, it's 8, z=6 is 9.2. So, z=5.5 would be about 8.6 Gpc. Hmm, but the options are 6,7,8,9.

Wait, but perhaps that table is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up the cosmological parameters. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make a better approximation. Let's calculate the integral numerically.

The integral is ∫ from 0 to z of 1/sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 + 0.7) dz'.

Let me split the integral from 0 to 5.5 into a few intervals, say from 0 to 1, 1 to 3, 3 to 5, 5 to 5.5.

First, compute each part.

For z' from 0 to 1:

At z'=0: 0.3*(1)^3 +0.7= 0.3 +0.7=1 → sqrt(1)=1 → integrand is 1.

At z'=1: 0.3*(2^3)=0.3*8=2.4 → 2.4+0.7=3.1 → sqrt(3.1)=~1.761 → integrand is ~0.568.

So between 0 and 1, the integrand decreases from 1 to ~0.568. Let's approximate this as the average of 1 and 0.568, which is 0.784. Multiply by delta z=1 → contributes ~0.784.

Next, z'=1 to 3:

At z'=1: integrand ~0.568.

At z'=2: 0.3*(3^3)=0.3*27=8.1 → 8.1 +0.7=8.8 → sqrt(8.8)=~2.966 → integrand ~0.337.

At z'=3: 0.3*(4^3)=0.3*64=19.2 →19.2 +0.7=19.9 → sqrt(19.9)=~4.461 → integrand ~0.224.

So let's calculate the average in 1-3. Maybe we can split into two parts: 1-2 and 2-3.

From 1 to 2: average of 0.568 and 0.337 is (0.568 + 0.337)/2 = ~0.4525. delta z=1 → contributes 0.4525.

From 2 to 3: average of 0.337 and 0.224 is ~0.2805. delta z=1 → contributes 0.2805.

So total for 1-3 is 0.4525 +0.2805=0.733.

Next, z'=3 to 5:

At z'=3: integrand 0.224.

At z'=4: 0.3*(5^3)=0.3*125=37.5 →37.5 +0.7=38.2 → sqrt(38.2)=~6.18 → integrand ~0.162.

At z'=5: 0.3*(6^3)=0.3*216=64.8 →64.8 +0.7=65.5 → sqrt(65.5)=~8.09 → integrand ~0.123.

So from 3 to5, let's split into 3-4 and 4-5.

3-4: average of 0.224 and 0.162 is 0.193 → delta z=1 → 0.193.

4-5: average of 0.162 and 0.123 is 0.1425 → delta z=1 → 0.1425.

Total for 3-5: 0.193 +0.1425 = 0.3355.

Now, from 5 to 5.5:

At z'=5: integrand ≈0.123.

At z'=5.5: (1+z')=6.5; 0.3*(6.5)^3 =0.3*(274.625)≈82.3875 →82.3875 +0.7=83.0875 → sqrt(83.0875)=~9.115 → integrand ≈1/9.115 ≈0.1097.

So average between 0.123 and 0.1097 is (0.123 +0.1097)/2 ≈0.11635. delta z=0.5 → contributes 0.058175.

So now, adding up all the parts:

0-1: 0.784

1-3: 0.733 → but wait, earlier I split it into 1-2 (0.4525) and 2-3 (0.2805), total 0.733.

3-5: 0.3355

5-5.5: 0.058175

Total integral = 0.784 + 0.733 + 0.3355 + 0.058175 ≈ 1.910675.

So the integral is approximately 1.9107.

Then, D_C = (c/H0) * integral.

c is 3e5 km/s, H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc.

c/H0 = (3e5) /70 ≈ 4285.7 Mpc = about 4.2857 Gpc.

So D_C = 4.2857 Gpc * 1.9107 ≈ let's calculate that.

4.2857 *1.9107 ≈ let's compute 4 *1.9107 is 7.6428, 0.2857 *1.9107 ≈0.546. So total ≈8.189 Gpc.

So approximately 8.19 Gpc.

Looking at the options, option B is 8 Gpc, option C is 9 Gpc.

Wait, but my approximate integral gave 1.91, which multiplied by 4.2857 gives ~8.19 Gpc. So that's close to 8 Gpc (option B). But wait, option D is 7 Gpc, which is lower.

Hmm, but wait, perhaps my approximation of the integral is a bit underestimated. Because I approximated each interval by the average, but sometimes the function is changing more rapidly.

Alternatively, perhaps using a more precise method, like the midpoint rule or Simpson's rule, would give a better approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a better approach. Let me think: another way to approximate the integral is to use the fact that E(z) = sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3 + 0.7).

Wait, for z=5.5, E(z)=sqrt(0.3*(6.5)^3 + 0.7)= sqrt(0.3*274.625 +0.7)= sqrt(82.3875 +0.7)=sqrt(83.0875)=~9.115.

Wait, but the integral is from 0 to5.5 of 1/sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3 +0.7) dz.

I think perhaps an online calculator would be better, but since I can't use that, maybe I can think about it another way.

Wait, another approach: use the look-up table for comoving distances with these cosmological parameters.

I think for H0=70, Ωm=0.3, the comoving distance at z=5 is approximately 8 Gpc. At z=6, it's around 9 Gpc. So for z=5.5, it's between 8 and 9, closer to 8.5.

So the options are 6,7,8,9. So the correct answer would be 8 Gpc or 9 Gpc.

But earlier approximation gave me about 8.19, which is near 8. So perhaps the correct answer is 8 Gpc (option B), but wait, looking back, the options are:

A) 6 Gpc

B) 8 Gpc

C) 9 Gpc

D) 7 Gpc.

Wait, but my approximation was 8.19, which is close to 8, so option B is 8 Gpc.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 9 Gpc, as the integral might have been underestimated.

Wait, but in my approximation, the integral was 1.91, which when multiplied by 4.2857 gives 8.19. So that would be close to 8 Gpc.

So perhaps the correct answer is option D) 7 Gpc? No, wait, why would it be 7? Because if the integral gives a lower value, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the integral approximation. Alternatively, perhaps I should use a better approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps the peak at 790 nm is not Lyman-alpha, but some other line. Wait, the question says the peak is at 790 nm. Wait, what is the typical emission line that's observed in quasars? Lyman-alpha is around 121 nm. If the observed wavelength is 790, that's a big redshift. But wait, optical and near-infrared observations. Wait, 790 nm is in the near-infrared (NIR), but optical is up to about 700 nm or so. So perhaps 790 is just beyond optical, which is NIR.

But wait, sometimes the Lyman series is in the UV, but for high redshift objects, when the Lyman-alpha is redshifted into optical, that's a high z. For example, if Lyman-alpha is observed at 790 nm, that's z=(790/121)-1 ≈ 6.52-1=5.52.

So that gives z≈5.5 as before.

So comoving distance at z=5.5 is about 8.19 Gpc, which is about 8 Gpc.

So the correct option is B)8 Gpc.

But wait, wait! I think I might have missed something. I think I've seen that for H0=70, the comoving distance at z=5 is around 8 Gpc, but perhaps at z=5.5, it's a bit more than that.

Wait, perhaps I should check another approach. For example, using the approximation formula from the cosmology literature.

The comoving distance is given by:

D_C = (c/H0) * ∫ (from 0 to z) [1/√(Ωm (1 + z')³ + Ωλ)] dz'

Since Ωr is negligible, we can ignore it.

Alternatively, I can use the approximation method provided in Hogg 1999 paper on distance measures.

But without the exact formula, perhaps I can look for a standard table for H0=70, Ωm=0.3, Ωλ=0.7.

Wait, I think I recall that at z=5.5, the comoving distance is approximately 8 Gpc. So the correct answer is B)8 Gpc.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the peak at 790 nm is not Lyman-alpha. Let me think, perhaps it's another emission line. Like hydrogen alpha (H-alpha) is at 656 nm rest. If observed at 790 nm, that's a redshift of (790/656)-1 ≈ (1.204)-1=0.204, so z=0.2. But that's a low redshift, which would make the comoving distance about 2 Gpc, which isn't an option here. So more likely, the peak is due to Lyman-alpha.

So I think the earlier conclusion holds: z≈5.5 and D_C≈8 Gpc.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the comoving distance of the quasar from Earth, we analyze the given data and cosmological parameters. The quasar's spectrum shows a peak at 790 nm, which is interpreted as the Lyman-alpha emission line (rest wavelength 121 nm) being redshifted. The redshift \( z \) is calculated as:

\[
z = \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}}}{\lambda_{\text{rest}}} - 1 = \frac{790}{121} - 1 \approx 5.5289
\]

This high redshift indicates the quasar is at a significant distance. The comoving distance \( D_C \) in a flat \(\Lambda\)-CDM universe is given by:

\[
D_C = \frac{c}{H_0} \int_0^z \frac{1}{\sqrt{\Omega_m (1+z')^3 + \Omega_\lambda}} \, dz'
\]

where \( c \) is the speed of light, \( H_0 = 70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc} \), \( \Omega_m = 0.3 \), and \( \Omega_\lambda = 0.7 \). The term \( \Omega_r \) (radiation density) is negligible at this high redshift.

### Step 1: Approximate the integral
The integral is challenging to compute analytically, so we approximate it by splitting it into intervals and using the average value of the integrand in each interval. The integrand is:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{\Omega_m (1+z')^3 + \Omega_\lambda}}
\]

For \( z \approx 5.5 \), the integrand decreases as \( z' \) increases. Approximating the integral numerically, we find it to be approximately \( 1.91 \).

### Step 2: Compute \( D_C \)
The term \( c/H_0 \) is:

\[
\frac{c}{H_0} = \frac{3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s}}{70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc}} \approx 4285.7 \, \text{Mpc} \approx 4.2857 \, \text{Gpc}
\]

Thus, the comoving distance is:

\[
D_C = 4.2857 \, \text{Gpc} \times 1.91 \approx 8.19 \, \text{Gpc}
\]

### Step 3: Compare with options
The computed comoving distance of \( D_C \approx 8.19 \, \text{Gpc} \) is closest to the option \( 8 \, \text{Gpc} \). Other options (6 Gpc, 7 Gpc, 9 Gpc) are either too low or too high based on the approximation.

### Conclusion
The quasar is at a comoving distance of approximately \( 8 \, \text{Gpc} \) from Earth under the given cosmological parameters.
