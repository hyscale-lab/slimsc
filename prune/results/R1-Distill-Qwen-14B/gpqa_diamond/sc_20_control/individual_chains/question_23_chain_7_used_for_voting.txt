Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Alright, the question is about a reaction involving ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene with hydrogen bromide (HBr). After some time, the reactant spot on TLC has diminished, and two new spots have appeared. We need to determine which products are formed from the given options.

First, I should probably draw the structure of the starting material to visualize it better. The compound is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. Breaking that down: the benzene ring has an ether oxygen attached. The other side of the oxygen is a butenyl group. Butenyl means there's a double bond. So the structure is benzene-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2, but wait, wait, no. Let me count the carbons. But-3-en-1-yl means the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4, right? Wait, but but has four carbons. So numbering from the oxygen end, it's 1, then 2, then 3, then 4. So the structure is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, but wait, but-3-en-1-yl would have double bond between C3 and C4? But but is four carbons. So 1, 2, 3, 4. The double bond is between C3 and C4, but that's only possible if it's 1-yl. Wait, maybe I should write it out.

So the structure is benzene-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? No, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think: but-3-en-1-yl is CH2CH2CH2CH2, but with a double bond starting at C3. Wait, but that's not possible because butenyl would be four carbons. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between C3 and C4? No, wait, but that can't be because buten-3-en-1-yl would imply a four-carbon chain with the double bond starting at C3, which would be between C3 and C4, but that's beyond the chain. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Let me draw it: 1 is the point of attachment (the oxygen), so the structure is O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? Wait, no, wait but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? That can't be. Wait, maybe it's more like CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. No, wait, but that would be but-1-en-4-yl or something. Maybe I should reconsider.

Alternatively, perhaps but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between C2 and C3? Because 3-en would be between C2 and C3, but that would be but-2-en-1-yl. Oh wait, maybe I got the numbering wrong. Let me number from the end attached to the oxygen. So the structure is O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2. No, wait, but the double bond's position is specified as 3-en. So the structure should be O-CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? No, that doesn't add up. Maybe I should think of it as the substituent on the benzene is an ether where the alkyl chain has a double bond. So the structure would be benzene-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2? No, wait, another approach: but-3-en-1-yl is (CH2)2CHCH2 with a double bond from C3 to C4. Wait, but that's four carbons. So the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. But with substituents, the 2,2-dimethyl part implies two methyl groups on the second carbon.

Wait, maybe the structure is: CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but no, with a double bond at 3. So it's CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure. Let me try to visualize it again. The starting material is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. So the benzene has an oxygen linked to a butenyl group; the butenyl is four carbons with a double bond starting at C3 (but wait, the total is four carbons, so the double bond is between C2 and C3. Wait, but that would be but-2-en-1-yl. Hmm, perhaps the correct structure is benzene-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2, but with a double bond somewhere.

Wait, maybe it's better to approach this differently. The starting material is an ether, with the benzene ring connected to an oxygen, which is connected to a butenyl group. The substituents on the butenyl group are 2,2-dimethyl. So the structure is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, but the butenyl has four carbons and a double bond. So perhaps it's OCH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2, but that doesn't make sense. I think I'm getting stuck on the structure. Maybe I should move forward and think about the reaction.

The reaction is with HBr, which is a typical reagent for addition to alkenes, probably via an acid-catalyzed mechanism. So the starting material has a double bond in the side chain attached to the benzene ring. HBr would likely add across that double bond, leading to an anti addition (since it's an acid-catalyzed addition, like in the formation of bromoalkanes).

Wait, but wait, in ethers, the adjacent carbons can also undergo certain reactions. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening, but I don't think so because HBr alone typically doesn't ring-open ethers unless under specific conditions, which I don't think are present here.

So more likely, the double bond in the side chain (butenyl group) is undergoing an addition reaction with HBr. So the starting material has a double bond in the substituent, so HBr adds to that.

In an acid-catalyzed addition, HBr adds across the double bond via a carbocation intermediate. So, for a butenyl group, the addition would occur in such a way that the more stable carbocation is formed. The structure of the starting substituent is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the substituent is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, but but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, that can't be because but is four carbons. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but with substituents. Oh, wait, maybe the structure is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between the third and fourth carbon. Wait, but that would require the substituent to be CH2-CH(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is (CH2)2-C(CH3)2-CH2 with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between the second and third carbons. No, because that would be but-2-en-1-yl. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me instead think about the possible products.

When HBr adds to a double bond, it adds across the double bond, typically in an anti addition. The more substituted carbocation is more stable, so it's favored. So in the starting material, the double bond is in a position that when HBr adds, it forms a more stable carbocation.

Assuming that the substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2 or similar, but perhaps the structure is (CH2)2-C(CH3)2 with a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2 with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4, but that would be at the end, so the addition would be more likely to form a secondary carbocation.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2, but that's not matching. I'm getting stuck, but maybe I should proceed.

Upon addition of HBr, the double bond in the substituent would react. Let's say the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but with two methyl groups on the second carbon (so it's 2,2-dimethyl). So the substituent is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, that doesn't make sense because there are only four carbons, so the positions would be 1,2,3,4. So 3-en would be between C3 and C4. But that would be the end, so the substituent would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. But that's not possible because CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 would require the double bond to be between C3 and C4, which would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond at the end. Wait, that's not possible; perhaps it's CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. So the substituent is OCH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but with two methyl groups on the second carbon. So the structure would be OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2?

Wait, no. Let me try again. The substituent is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl). So but has four carbons. The substituent is in the 1 position (attached to oxygen), and the double bond is between C3 and C4. So the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but with two methyl groups on C2. So it's CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. Oh, that makes sense. So the structure is benzene-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2.

Wait, no, the but-3-en-1-yl would have four carbons. So substituent is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2 with the double bond between carbons 3 and 4. But with two methyl groups on carbon 2. So substituent is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. So the substituent is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, but that would require the substituent to be CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons. So the substituent is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2? No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond.

Wait, perhaps it's better to move on. So the reaction is with HBr. So the addition would happen. The double bond is between C3 and C4 of the substituent. So adding HBr across that double bond would give two products? Or maybe it's an allylic bromination, but that's more likely with peroxides and NBS, not HBr. So more likely, it's an acid-catalyzed addition.

So adding HBr would result in two possible products, depending on where the H and Br add. Wait, but in an addition reaction, the H adds to one carbon and Br to the other. The more substituted carbocation is more stable. So in the substituent, after the double bond is between C3 and C4, adding HBr would form a carbocation at C3 or C4?

Wait, the structure of the substituent after the oxygen is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between CH2 and CH2.

Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine the substituent as CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. Oh wait, perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C2 and C3. Wait, but that would be but-2-en-1-yl. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible products.

If the substituent is OCH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2, but I'm not quite right. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, if the substituent is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, then the double bond would have to be between C3 and C4. So adding HBr would add across that, leading to a CH2Br group and a CH2H group. Wait, but in that case, the addition would be H on one end and Br on the other.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is OCH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2, but that doesn't seem right. I'm getting stuck on the structure, which is making it hard to proceed. Maybe I should look for another approach.

The options given are A, B, C, D. Let's look through them.

Option A: 2-(2,2-dimethylbutyl)phenol and 4-(2,2-dimethylbutyl)phenol. So this suggests that the ether oxygen has been replaced by an -OH group, leading to phenol, and the substituent is a butyl group. But that would imply an acid-catalyzed cleavage of the ether, which I don't think is happening here because HBr isn't typically used for that without more severe conditions. So probably not A.

Option B: (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and ((2,3-dimethylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. So one product is a brominated ether, and another is an ether with a double bond shifted. That suggests some kind of addition followed by elimination or isomerization. But wait, HBr usually adds, not substitutes or eliminates. But maybe it's a possibility.

Option C: 3,3,4-trimethylchromane and 3-isopropyl-3-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran. These structures look like they might result from some ring-opening or cycloaddition. Chromane is a benzene ring fused with a cyclohexane, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps it's a result of some kind of acid-catalyzed ring-opening, but I'm not sure.

Option D: (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene. So both products are brominated ethers, with Br added at either position 3 or 4 of the substituent. That would suggest substitution rather than addition, but HBr typically adds to double bonds, not substitutes unless in specific conditions like SN2, which would require a good leaving group. But the substituent in the starting material has an ether, which isn't a good leaving group. Unless the HBr is acting as an acid catalyst for some other process.

Wait, but another possibility is that the reaction is an allylic bromination. HBr can sometimes act as a source of Br for allylic positions. In allylic bromination, the Br adds to the allylic position, which is adjacent to the double bond. But that usually requires peroxides or light, but maybe not. Alternatively, in the presence of HBr, a carbocation could form, leading to bromide attacking the adjacent carbons.

Wait, but the reaction is with HBr, which is a strong acid and a source of Br-. So perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed addition followed by a possible carbocation rearrangement.

Let me think: if the substituent is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4, adding HBr would add H to one end and Br to the other. So the initial product would have Br on C4. But carbocations can rearrange. For example, if the initial carbocation is on C3, it might undergo a hydride shift to form a more stable carbocation on C2 or C4.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is OCH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. Adding HBr across the double bond would form a carbocation at C4 (since the H adds to C3, Br to C4), but if that's not the most stable, it might rearrange. Let's say the substituent is OCH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C2 and C3. So the substituent is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but that's not matching the but-3-en-1-yl part.

I think I'm getting stuck on this, so perhaps I should focus on the reaction type. The reaction is addition of HBr to the double bond. If the substituent is a butenyl group with the double bond in a position that allows for carbocation rearrangement, then the initial addition could lead to a more stable carbocation via hydride shift, leading to possible products.

So, if the substituent is OCH2-CH2-CH=CH2, adding HBr would form either OCH2-CH2-CHBr-CH3 (if H adds to CH2 and Br to CH2) or OCH2-CH2-CH2-CH2Br. But with two methyl groups on C2, it would be OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2.

Adding HBr to the double bond in that substituent would form a carbocation on either C3 or C4. Let's say the substituent after O is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. So the substituent is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but wait, that's four carbons. Alternatively, it's OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2.

Adding HBr could add across the double bond, making OCH2-C(CH3)2-CHBr-CH2Br? No, wait, that can't be right. Wait, when H adds to one end and Br to the other, you get a bromoalkane.

Wait, perhaps the substituent after the addition would be OCH2-C(CH3)2-CHBr-CH3. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent after addition is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2Br, but that's if the Br adds to the end.

But I'm not clear. Maybe I should think about the possible products. The starting material has a substituent with a double bond. After adding HBr, the substituent would have a Br and a H added across the double bond. Then, perhaps, the product would have a Br in either position, leading to different structures.

Looking at the options, option D has two products where the Br is at positions 3 and 4 of the substituent. If the substituent after addition is a bromoalkane, then bromine could be at either position, perhaps due to different addition pathways or carbocation rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to more than one product due to the possibility of the carbocation rearranging. For example, the initial carbocation forms at a less stable position, which then rearranges to a more stable position, leading to different products.

Wait, considering the starting substituent, if the double bond is between C3 and C4 (assuming substituent is OCH2-CH2-CH=CH2 with substituents), then adding HBr would form a carbocation at C3. But that's a secondary carbocation. If a more stable carbocation is possible, perhaps via hydride shift, it could form a tertiary carbocation.

So, if the initial carbocation is at C3 (secondary), it might rearrange to a more stable position, say C2, if possible. For example, a hydride shift from C2 to C3 would form a carbocation at C2, which is more substituted.

Wait, but the substituent is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. So adding HBr across the double bond (C3-C4) would make a carbocation at C3. But if there's a possibility for a hydride shift, maybe the carbocation moves to C2, which already has two methyl groups. That would make it a tertiary carbocation, which is more stable.

So when HBr adds to the double bond, the initial product is a secondary carbocation at C3. But this can rearrange via a hydride shift to form a tertiary carbocation at C2. Then, Br- would attack that, leading to the bromide attaching at C2.

Wait, but after the hydride shift, the Br would be added to C2, which is already substituted with two methyl groups. So the structure would have Br at C2, leading to a different product.

So, in this scenario, two products might form: one where Br is added at the original position (without rearrangement), and another where Br is added after rearrangement.

But wait, in reality, the more stable carbocation would be formed and would dominate, so maybe only the rearranged product is formed. But the question states that two new spots appeared, suggesting two products.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't involve carbocation rearrangement and just adds Br in two different positions. But that doesn't make much sense because the addition is typically regioselective.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, the reaction could be a ring-opening of the ether, but that's less likely without a good nucleophile, and HBr isn't typically used for that without specific conditions.

Another possibility is that the reaction involves the acid (HBr) protonating the ether oxygen, making it a better leaving group. But that would require a good leaving group, which the oxygen isn't. Unless it's a very specific case.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed elimination, but that would require the starting material to have a leaving group, which it doesn't—unless the HBr is acting as a base.

Wait, but the starting material is an ether. If HBr is added, perhaps the Br could substitute the oxygen, but that's not common without a good leaving group. So unless the oxygen is protonated, making it a better leaving group, but even then, substitution would require a good nucleophile, which Br- is.

Wait, but substitution on ethers (SN2) is difficult because the oxygen is not a good leaving group unless it's activated. But I don't think HBr would do that under normal conditions.

So, perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed addition to the double bond, leading to a bromoalkane. But then why two products?

Alternatively, maybe the substituent has two possible sites for addition, leading to different regioisomers. But in an acid-catalyzed addition, the more substituted carbocation is formed, so only one product would dominate.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is such that the double bond can add in two different positions, leading to two products. But that seems unlikely because the double bond is fixed.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't an addition but an elimination. But HBr is a typical reagent for addition, not elimination.

Hmm, I'm not getting anywhere. Let's think about the options again.

Option B: One product is a brominated ether (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxybenzene) and another is an ether with a double bond shifted (2,3-dimethylbut-2-en-1-yl). So perhaps the bromide adds to the substituent, and another product forms via a different mechanism, like a rearrangement or isomerization.

Option D: Both products are brominated ethers, with Br at different positions (3 and 4). So that suggests two different substitution points, but under what mechanism would that happen?

Wait, another possibility: if the starting material has two different sites where the HBr could add, leading to two different products. For example, if the substituent has a double bond that can add in more than one way, but that's not typical unless there's some kind of diastereomerism or different addition pathways.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is such that upon addition, a more substituted carbocation is formed, and another product comes from a less substituted carbocation, but that would be minor.

Wait, in the starting substituent, if the double bond is between C2 and C3, then adding HBr could form a secondary carbocation at C2 or C3. But if the substituent is such that adding HBr leads to possible carbocations at two different positions, both of which are possible, then two products could form.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C2 and C3. So the substituent is OCH2-CH2-CH=CH2 with two methyl groups on C2. So adding HBr across the double bond would form a carbocation at C2 or C3. Which is more stable?

If the substituent is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C2 and C3, then adding HBr would form a carbocation at C2 or C3. Hmm, but if the substituent is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2, the double bond is between C3 and C4. So adding HBr would give a carbocation at C3, which is secondary. But maybe it can rearrange to a more stable position.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. Adding HBr would add H to CH2 and Br to CH2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the H adds to the end, leading to a carbocation at the more substituted position.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the possible products.

If the substituent is OCH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2 with a double bond, adding HBr would give two products based on where the Br adds. But I'm not certain.

Looking back at the options, option D has two brominated ethers, suggesting that Br adds to the substituent in two different positions. If the substituent can form two different carbocations (primary and secondary, but that's unlikely), then Br could add to two positions.

But I'm not seeing it clearly. Alternatively, maybe one product is the result of direct addition, and the other is due to a carbocation rearrangement.

Another approach: in the reaction, the initial product is formed by addition of HBr, which forms a bromoalkane. Then, perhaps, the molecule undergoes elimination, forming another product. But that would require the presence of a base, which isn't mentioned here.

Wait, but HBr is a strong acid. So perhaps the reaction isn't just addition. Maybe the substituent acts as a base, abstracting a proton and leading to an elimination. But I'm not sure.

An alternative reaction is that the substituent undergoes an acid-catalyzed ring-opening, but that's not typical for ethers without specific conditions.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a diene. But I don't think so; the substituent is butenyl, so a monoene.

Hmm. Let me think about the reaction again. HBr adds to the double bond, forming a bromoalkane. But if the substituent can form two different carbocations upon addition, leading to two different products, then two products would form. But usually, the more stable carbocation is predominant.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is such that the initial carbocation can rearrange to form a more stable carbocation, leading to two different products. For example, the initial carbocation is secondary, and after rearrangement, it becomes tertiary. So one product would be the non-rearranged, and the other the rearranged. So in the products, Br would be in two different positions, leading to two spots on TLC.

Looking at the options, option D has two brominated ethers with Br at positions 3 and 4. If the substituent is (2,2-dimethylbutoxy), then the positions 3 and 4 would correspond to different carbons in the substituent.

Wait, the substituent in option D is 4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy and 3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy. So the substituent is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2Br. So for 4-bromo, Br is on the last carbon, and for 3-bromo, Br is on the third carbon.

If the substituent after HBr addition is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CHBr-CH3, that would be 3-bromo. Alternatively, if Br is on the fourth carbon, it's 4-bromo.

So how could two different brominated products form? Maybe via different addition sites or carbocation rearrangements.

If the substituent is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2, adding HBr would add H to one end and Br to the other. But depending on the position, you could get Br on the third carbon or the fourth.

Wait, let's say the substituent is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. So the substituent is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2.

Adding HBr across the double bond (C3 and C4) would form a carbocation at C3. But C3 is attached to C(CH3)2, which is a tertiary center. So the carbocation at C3 would be more stable than a primary one. So the Br would add to C4, leading to OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2Br. That's the 4-bromo product.

But if there's a possibility of carbocation rearrangement, perhaps via a hydride shift, the carbocation could move from C3 to C2, which is already substituted with two methyl groups, making it even more stable. Then Br would add to C2, leading to OCH2-C(CH3)Br-CH2-CH3. That would be the 3-bromo product.

So both products would form: 4-bromo and 3-bromo derivatives. Hence, two products, which matches option D.

Looking at option D: (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene.

So that would fit the scenario where the initial carbocation forms at C3, then rearranges to C2, leading to two different products.

So the correct answer would be option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene reacting with hydrogen bromide (HBr). The starting material is an ether where the benzene ring is attached to an oxygen, which is connected to a butenyl group. The butenyl group has a double bond between C3 and C4, with two methyl groups on C2. The reaction with HBr proceeds via acid-catalyzed addition across the double bond, forming a carbocation intermediate.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Structure of the Starting Material**:  
   The substituent on the benzene ring is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2, where the double bond is between C3 and C4. The two methyl groups are on C2, making it a substituted butenyl group.

2. **Reaction Mechanism**:  
   - HBr adds across the double bond, forming a carbocation at C3 (the less substituted position).  
   - The carbocation at C3 can rearrange via a hydride shift to form a more stable tertiary carbocation at C2.  
   - Bromide ions (Br⁻) then attack the carbocations at both C3 and C2, leading to two products.

3. **Products**:  
   - **4-Bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxybenzene**: Formed when Br⁻ attacks the carbocation at C3.  
   - **3-Bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxybenzene**: Formed when Br⁻ attacks the carbocation at C2 after a hydride shift.  

4. **TLC Observation**:  
   The TLC results show the reactant spot diminishing and two new spots appearing, consistent with the formation of two products.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Suggests the formation of phenol derivatives, which is unlikely as the reaction conditions do not favor ether cleavage.  
- **Option B**: Proposes a brominated ether and an isomerized ether with a shifted double bond. This is inconsistent with the reaction mechanism, as HBr typically adds rather than isomerizing the double bond.  
- **Option C**: Suggests the formation of complex cyclic structures, which are not plausible under the given reaction conditions.  
- **Option D**: Proposes two brominated ethers, 4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxybenzene and 3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxybenzene. This matches the expected products from the addition and possible carbocation rearrangement.

### Conclusion:
The reaction proceeds via acid-catalyzed addition of HBr across the double bond, followed by carbocation rearrangement. This leads to the formation of two products: 4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxybenzene and 3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxybenzene. These correspond to **Option D**.

Answer: D

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Alright, the question is about a reaction involving ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene with hydrogen bromide (HBr). After some time, the reactant spot on TLC has diminished, and two new spots have appeared. We need to determine which products are formed from the given options.

First, I should probably draw the structure of the starting material to visualize it better. The compound is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. Breaking that down: the benzene ring has an ether oxygen attached. The other side of the oxygen is a butenyl group. Butenyl means there's a double bond. So the structure is benzene-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2, but wait, wait, no. Let me count the carbons. But-3-en-1-yl means the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4, right? Wait, but but has four carbons. So numbering from the oxygen end, it's 1, then 2, then 3, then 4. So the structure is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, but wait, but-3-en-1-yl would have double bond between C3 and C4? But but is four carbons. So 1, 2, 3, 4. The double bond is between C3 and C4, but that's only possible if it's 1-yl. Wait, maybe I should write it out.

So the structure is benzene-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? No, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think: but-3-en-1-yl is CH2CH2CH2CH2, but with a double bond starting at C3. Wait, but that's not possible because butenyl would be four carbons. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between C3 and C4? No, wait, but that can't be because buten-3-en-1-yl would imply a four-carbon chain with the double bond starting at C3, which would be between C3 and C4, but that's beyond the chain. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Let me draw it: 1 is the point of attachment (the oxygen), so the structure is O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? Wait, no, wait but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? That can't be. Wait, maybe it's more like CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. No, wait, but that would be but-1-en-4-yl or something. Maybe I should reconsider.

Alternatively, perhaps but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between C2 and C3? Because 3-en would be between C2 and C3, but that would be but-2-en-1-yl. Oh wait, maybe I got the numbering wrong. Let me number from the end attached to the oxygen. So the structure is O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2. No, wait, but the double bond's position is specified as 3-en. So the structure should be O-CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? No, that doesn't add up. Maybe I should think of it as the substituent on the benzene is an ether where the alkyl chain has a double bond. So the structure would be benzene-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2? No, wait, another approach: but-3-en-1-yl is (CH2)2CHCH2 with a double bond from C3 to C4. Wait, but that's four carbons. So the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. But with substituents, the 2,2-dimethyl part implies two methyl groups on the second carbon.

Wait, maybe the structure is: CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but no, with a double bond at 3. So it's CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure. Let me try to visualize it again. The starting material is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. So the benzene has an oxygen linked to a butenyl group; the butenyl is four carbons with a double bond starting at C3 (but wait, the total is four carbons, so the double bond is between C2 and C3. Wait, but that would be but-2-en-1-yl. Hmm, perhaps the correct structure is benzene-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2, but with a double bond somewhere.

Wait, maybe it's better to approach this differently. The starting material is an ether, with the benzene ring connected to an oxygen, which is connected to a butenyl group. The substituents on the butenyl group are 2,2-dimethyl. So the structure is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, but the butenyl has four carbons and a double bond. So perhaps it's OCH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2, but that doesn't make sense. I think I'm getting stuck on the structure. Maybe I should move forward and think about the reaction.

The reaction is with HBr, which is a typical reagent for addition to alkenes, probably via an acid-catalyzed mechanism. So the starting material has a double bond in the side chain attached to the benzene ring. HBr would likely add across that double bond, leading to an anti addition (since it's an acid-catalyzed addition, like in the formation of bromoalkanes).

Wait, but wait, in ethers, the adjacent carbons can also undergo certain reactions. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening, but I don't think so because HBr alone typically doesn't ring-open ethers unless under specific conditions, which I don't think are present here.

So more likely, the double bond in the side chain (butenyl group) is undergoing an addition reaction with HBr. So the starting material has a double bond in the substituent, so HBr adds to that.

In an acid-catalyzed addition, HBr adds across the double bond via a carbocation intermediate. So, for a butenyl group, the addition would occur in such a way that the more stable carbocation is formed. The structure of the starting substituent is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the substituent is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, but but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, that can't be because but is four carbons. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but with substituents. Oh, wait, maybe the structure is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between the third and fourth carbon. Wait, but that would require the substituent to be CH2-CH(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is (CH2)2-C(CH3)2-CH2 with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between the second and third carbons. No, because that would be but-2-en-1-yl. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me instead think about the possible products.

When HBr adds to a double bond, it adds across the double bond, typically in an anti addition. The more substituted carbocation is more stable, so it's favored. So in the starting material, the double bond is in a position that when HBr adds, it forms a more stable carbocation.

Assuming that the substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2 or similar, but perhaps the structure is (CH2)2-C(CH3)2 with a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2 with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4, but that would be at the end, so the addition would be more likely to form a secondary carbocation.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2, but that's not matching. I'm getting stuck, but maybe I should proceed.

Upon addition of HBr, the double bond in the substituent would react. Let's say the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but with two methyl groups on the second carbon (so it's 2,2-dimethyl). So the substituent is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, that doesn't make sense because there are only four carbons, so the positions would be 1,2,3,4. So 3-en would be between C3 and C4. But that would be the end, so the substituent would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. But that's not possible because CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 would require the double bond to be between C3 and C4, which would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond at the end. Wait, that's not possible; perhaps it's CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. So the substituent is OCH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but with two methyl groups on the second carbon. So the structure would be OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2?

Wait, no. Let me try again. The substituent is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl). So but has four carbons. The substituent is in the 1 position (attached to oxygen), and the double bond is between C3 and C4. So the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but with two methyl groups on C2. So it's CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. Oh, that makes sense. So the structure is benzene-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2.

Wait, no, the but-3-en-1-yl would have four carbons. So substituent is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2 with the double bond between carbons 3 and 4. But with two methyl groups on carbon 2. So substituent is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. So the substituent is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, but that would require the substituent to be CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons. So the substituent is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2? No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond.

Wait, perhaps it's better to move on. So the reaction is with HBr. So the addition would happen. The double bond is between C3 and C4 of the substituent. So adding HBr across that double bond would give two products? Or maybe it's an allylic bromination, but that's more likely with peroxides and NBS, not HBr. So more likely, it's an acid-catalyzed addition.

So adding HBr would result in two possible products, depending on where the H and Br add. Wait, but in an addition reaction, the H adds to one carbon and Br to the other. The more substituted carbocation is more stable. So in the substituent, after the double bond is between C3 and C4, adding HBr would form a carbocation at C3 or C4?

Wait, the structure of the substituent after the oxygen is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between CH2 and CH2.

Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine the substituent as CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. Oh wait, perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C2 and C3. Wait, but that would be but-2-en-1-yl. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible products.

If the substituent is OCH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2, but I'm not quite right. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, if the substituent is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, then the double bond would have to be between C3 and C4. So adding HBr would add across that, leading to a CH2Br group and a CH2H group. Wait, but in that case, the addition would be H on one end and Br on the other.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is OCH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2, but that doesn't seem right. I'm getting stuck on the structure, which is making it hard to proceed. Maybe I should look for another approach.

The options given are A, B, C, D. Let's look through them.

Option A: 2-(2,2-dimethylbutyl)phenol and 4-(2,2-dimethylbutyl)phenol. So this suggests that the ether oxygen has been replaced by an -OH group, leading to phenol, and the substituent is a butyl group. But that would imply an acid-catalyzed cleavage of the ether, which I don't think is happening here because HBr isn't typically used for that without more severe conditions. So probably not A.

Option B: (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and ((2,3-dimethylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. So one product is a brominated ether, and another is an ether with a double bond shifted. That suggests some kind of addition followed by elimination or isomerization. But wait, HBr usually adds, not substitutes or eliminates. But maybe it's a possibility.

Option C: 3,3,4-trimethylchromane and 3-isopropyl-3-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran. These structures look like they might result from some ring-opening or cycloaddition. Chromane is a benzene ring fused with a cyclohexane, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps it's a result of some kind of acid-catalyzed ring-opening, but I'm not sure.

Option D: (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene. So both products are brominated ethers, with Br added at either position 3 or 4 of the substituent. That would suggest substitution rather than addition, but HBr typically adds to double bonds, not substitutes unless in specific conditions like SN2, which would require a good leaving group. But the substituent in the starting material has an ether, which isn't a good leaving group. Unless the HBr is acting as an acid catalyst for some other process.

Wait, but another possibility is that the reaction is an allylic bromination. HBr can sometimes act as a source of Br for allylic positions. In allylic bromination, the Br adds to the allylic position, which is adjacent to the double bond. But that usually requires peroxides or light, but maybe not. Alternatively, in the presence of HBr, a carbocation could form, leading to bromide attacking the adjacent carbons.

Wait, but the reaction is with HBr, which is a strong acid and a source of Br-. So perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed addition followed by a possible carbocation rearrangement.

Let me think: if the substituent is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4, adding HBr would add H to one end and Br to the other. So the initial product would have Br on C4. But carbocations can rearrange. For example, if the initial carbocation is on C3, it might undergo a hydride shift to form a more stable carbocation on C2 or C4.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is OCH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. Adding HBr across the double bond would form a carbocation at C4 (since the H adds to C3, Br to C4), but if that's not the most stable, it might rearrange. Let's say the substituent is OCH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C2 and C3. So the substituent is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but that's not matching the but-3-en-1-yl part.

I think I'm getting stuck on this, so perhaps I should focus on the reaction type. The reaction is addition of HBr to the double bond. If the substituent is a butenyl group with the double bond in a position that allows for carbocation rearrangement, then the initial addition could lead to a more stable carbocation via hydride shift, leading to possible products.

So, if the substituent is OCH2-CH2-CH=CH2, adding HBr would form either OCH2-CH2-CHBr-CH3 (if H adds to CH2 and Br to CH2) or OCH2-CH2-CH2-CH2Br. But with two methyl groups on C2, it would be OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2.

Adding HBr to the double bond in that substituent would form a carbocation on either C3 or C4. Let's say the substituent after O is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. So the substituent is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but wait, that's four carbons. Alternatively, it's OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2.

Adding HBr could add across the double bond, making OCH2-C(CH3)2-CHBr-CH2Br? No, wait, that can't be right. Wait, when H adds to one end and Br to the other, you get a bromoalkane.

Wait, perhaps the substituent after the addition would be OCH2-C(CH3)2-CHBr-CH3. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent after addition is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2Br, but that's if the Br adds to the end.

But I'm not clear. Maybe I should think about the possible products. The starting material has a substituent with a double bond. After adding HBr, the substituent would have a Br and a H added across the double bond. Then, perhaps, the product would have a Br in either position, leading to different structures.

Looking at the options, option D has two products where the Br is at positions 3 and 4 of the substituent. If the substituent after addition is a bromoalkane, then bromine could be at either position, perhaps due to different addition pathways or carbocation rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to more than one product due to the possibility of the carbocation rearranging. For example, the initial carbocation forms at a less stable position, which then rearranges to a more stable position, leading to different products.

Wait, considering the starting substituent, if the double bond is between C3 and C4 (assuming substituent is OCH2-CH2-CH=CH2 with substituents), then adding HBr would form a carbocation at C3. But that's a secondary carbocation. If a more stable carbocation is possible, perhaps via hydride shift, it could form a tertiary carbocation.

So, if the initial carbocation is at C3 (secondary), it might rearrange to a more stable position, say C2, if possible. For example, a hydride shift from C2 to C3 would form a carbocation at C2, which is more substituted.

Wait, but the substituent is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. So adding HBr across the double bond (C3-C4) would make a carbocation at C3. But if there's a possibility for a hydride shift, maybe the carbocation moves to C2, which already has two methyl groups. That would make it a tertiary carbocation, which is more stable.

So when HBr adds to the double bond, the initial product is a secondary carbocation at C3. But this can rearrange via a hydride shift to form a tertiary carbocation at C2. Then, Br- would attack that, leading to the bromide attaching at C2.

Wait, but after the hydride shift, the Br would be added to C2, which is already substituted with two methyl groups. So the structure would have Br at C2, leading to a different product.

So, in this scenario, two products might form: one where Br is added at the original position (without rearrangement), and another where Br is added after rearrangement.

But wait, in reality, the more stable carbocation would be formed and would dominate, so maybe only the rearranged product is formed. But the question states that two new spots appeared, suggesting two products.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't involve carbocation rearrangement and just adds Br in two different positions. But that doesn't make much sense because the addition is typically regioselective.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, the reaction could be a ring-opening of the ether, but that's less likely without a good nucleophile, and HBr isn't typically used for that without specific conditions.

Another possibility is that the reaction involves the acid (HBr) protonating the ether oxygen, making it a better leaving group. But that would require a good leaving group, which the oxygen isn't. Unless it's a very specific case.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed elimination, but that would require the starting material to have a leaving group, which it doesn't—unless the HBr is acting as a base.

Wait, but the starting material is an ether. If HBr is added, perhaps the Br could substitute the oxygen, but that's not common without a good leaving group. So unless the oxygen is protonated, making it a better leaving group, but even then, substitution would require a good nucleophile, which Br- is.

Wait, but substitution on ethers (SN2) is difficult because the oxygen is not a good leaving group unless it's activated. But I don't think HBr would do that under normal conditions.

So, perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed addition to the double bond, leading to a bromoalkane. But then why two products?

Alternatively, maybe the substituent has two possible sites for addition, leading to different regioisomers. But in an acid-catalyzed addition, the more substituted carbocation is formed, so only one product would dominate.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is such that the double bond can add in two different positions, leading to two products. But that seems unlikely because the double bond is fixed.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't an addition but an elimination. But HBr is a typical reagent for addition, not elimination.

Hmm, I'm not getting anywhere. Let's think about the options again.

Option B: One product is a brominated ether (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxybenzene) and another is an ether with a double bond shifted (2,3-dimethylbut-2-en-1-yl). So perhaps the bromide adds to the substituent, and another product forms via a different mechanism, like a rearrangement or isomerization.

Option D: Both products are brominated ethers, with Br at different positions (3 and 4). So that suggests two different substitution points, but under what mechanism would that happen?

Wait, another possibility: if the starting material has two different sites where the HBr could add, leading to two different products. For example, if the substituent has a double bond that can add in more than one way, but that's not typical unless there's some kind of diastereomerism or different addition pathways.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is such that upon addition, a more substituted carbocation is formed, and another product comes from a less substituted carbocation, but that would be minor.

Wait, in the starting substituent, if the double bond is between C2 and C3, then adding HBr could form a secondary carbocation at C2 or C3. But if the substituent is such that adding HBr leads to possible carbocations at two different positions, both of which are possible, then two products could form.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C2 and C3. So the substituent is OCH2-CH2-CH=CH2 with two methyl groups on C2. So adding HBr across the double bond would form a carbocation at C2 or C3. Which is more stable?

If the substituent is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C2 and C3, then adding HBr would form a carbocation at C2 or C3. Hmm, but if the substituent is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2, the double bond is between C3 and C4. So adding HBr would give a carbocation at C3, which is secondary. But maybe it can rearrange to a more stable position.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. Adding HBr would add H to CH2 and Br to CH2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the H adds to the end, leading to a carbocation at the more substituted position.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the possible products.

If the substituent is OCH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2 with a double bond, adding HBr would give two products based on where the Br adds. But I'm not certain.

Looking back at the options, option D has two brominated ethers, suggesting that Br adds to the substituent in two different positions. If the substituent can form two different carbocations (primary and secondary, but that's unlikely), then Br could add to two positions.

But I'm not seeing it clearly. Alternatively, maybe one product is the result of direct addition, and the other is due to a carbocation rearrangement.

Another approach: in the reaction, the initial product is formed by addition of HBr, which forms a bromoalkane. Then, perhaps, the molecule undergoes elimination, forming another product. But that would require the presence of a base, which isn't mentioned here.

Wait, but HBr is a strong acid. So perhaps the reaction isn't just addition. Maybe the substituent acts as a base, abstracting a proton and leading to an elimination. But I'm not sure.

An alternative reaction is that the substituent undergoes an acid-catalyzed ring-opening, but that's not typical for ethers without specific conditions.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a diene. But I don't think so; the substituent is butenyl, so a monoene.

Hmm. Let me think about the reaction again. HBr adds to the double bond, forming a bromoalkane. But if the substituent can form two different carbocations upon addition, leading to two different products, then two products would form. But usually, the more stable carbocation is predominant.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is such that the initial carbocation can rearrange to form a more stable carbocation, leading to two different products. For example, the initial carbocation is secondary, and after rearrangement, it becomes tertiary. So one product would be the non-rearranged, and the other the rearranged. So in the products, Br would be in two different positions, leading to two spots on TLC.

Looking at the options, option D has two brominated ethers with Br at positions 3 and 4. If the substituent is (2,2-dimethylbutoxy), then the positions 3 and 4 would correspond to different carbons in the substituent.

Wait, the substituent in option D is 4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy and 3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy. So the substituent is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2Br. So for 4-bromo, Br is on the last carbon, and for 3-bromo, Br is on the third carbon.

If the substituent after HBr addition is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CHBr-CH3, that would be 3-bromo. Alternatively, if Br is on the fourth carbon, it's 4-bromo.

So how could two different brominated products form? Maybe via different addition sites or carbocation rearrangements.

If the substituent is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2, adding HBr would add H to one end and Br to the other. But depending on the position, you could get Br on the third carbon or the fourth.

Wait, let's say the substituent is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. So the substituent is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2.

Adding HBr across the double bond (C3 and C4) would form a carbocation at C3. But C3 is attached to C(CH3)2, which is a tertiary center. So the carbocation at C3 would be more stable than a primary one. So the Br would add to C4, leading to OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2Br. That's the 4-bromo product.

But if there's a possibility of carbocation rearrangement, perhaps via a hydride shift, the carbocation could move from C3 to C2, which is already substituted with two methyl groups, making it even more stable. Then Br would add to C2, leading to OCH2-C(CH3)Br-CH2-CH3. That would be the 3-bromo product.

So both products would form: 4-bromo and 3-bromo derivatives. Hence, two products, which matches option D.

Looking at option D: (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene.

So that would fit the scenario where the initial carbocation forms at C3, then rearranges to C2, leading to two different products.

So the correct answer would be option D.


The reaction involves ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene reacting with hydrogen bromide (HBr). The starting material is an ether where the benzene ring is attached to an oxygen, which is connected to a butenyl group. The butenyl group has a double bond between C3 and C4, with two methyl groups on C2. The reaction with HBr proceeds via acid-catalyzed addition across the double bond, forming a carbocation intermediate.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Structure of the Starting Material**:  
   The substituent on the benzene ring is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2, where the double bond is between C3 and C4. The two methyl groups are on C2, making it a substituted butenyl group.

2. **Reaction Mechanism**:  
   - HBr adds across the double bond, forming a carbocation at C3 (the less substituted position).  
   - The carbocation at C3 can rearrange via a hydride shift to form a more stable tertiary carbocation at C2.  
   - Bromide ions (Br⁻) then attack the carbocations at both C3 and C2, leading to two products.

3. **Products**:  
   - **4-Bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxybenzene**: Formed when Br⁻ attacks the carbocation at C3.  
   - **3-Bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxybenzene**: Formed when Br⁻ attacks the carbocation at C2 after a hydride shift.  

4. **TLC Observation**:  
   The TLC results show the reactant spot diminishing and two new spots appearing, consistent with the formation of two products.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Suggests the formation of phenol derivatives, which is unlikely as the reaction conditions do not favor ether cleavage.  
- **Option B**: Proposes a brominated ether and an isomerized ether with a shifted double bond. This is inconsistent with the reaction mechanism, as HBr typically adds rather than isomerizing the double bond.  
- **Option C**: Suggests the formation of complex cyclic structures, which are not plausible under the given reaction conditions.  
- **Option D**: Proposes two brominated ethers, 4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxybenzene and 3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxybenzene. This matches the expected products from the addition and possible carbocation rearrangement.

### Conclusion:
The reaction proceeds via acid-catalyzed addition of HBr across the double bond, followed by carbocation rearrangement. This leads to the formation of two products: 4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxybenzene and 3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxybenzene. These correspond to **Option D**.

Answer: D
