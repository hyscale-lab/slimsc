Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

First, the question describes a series of reactions, and we need to find out how many distinct hydrogen signals are in the NMR spectrum of the final product. The options are A to D, with numbers ranging from 5 to 12. Hmm, okay.

Let me start by figuring out each step of the reaction sequence.

Step 1: Acetic acid is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating. I remember that acetic anhydride is a good acetylating agent. Bromine in the presence of pyridine... Oh wait, I think this is a bromination reaction. Acetic acid has an -OH group. When you treat it with Br2 and pyridine, maybe it's a substitution. But wait, acetic acid is a weak acid. Maybe it's forming an acetylated intermediate. Alternatively, I recall that pyridine can act as a base and also can help in the substitution.

Wait, perhaps this is an example of the Hell–Volhard–Zelinskii reaction? No, that's for alpha bromination of carboxylic acids. Or wait, maybe it's the bromination of the hydroxyl group. So, if acetic acid has an -OH, and we brominate it, perhaps it's converting the -OH into -OBr. But wait, in presence of acetic anhydride and pyridine, maybe it's more likely that the acetic anhydride is acting as a acetylating agent. Oh! Pyridine can help in acylation reactions. So acetic anhydride would act as an acetylating agent, and Br2 might be part of another reaction.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe this is a benzoin condensation? No, that's for ketones. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but that's for aromatic rings. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's about forming an acyl bromide. But wait, acetic acid reacting with Br2 and pyridine—could it be that the -OH is being replaced by Br?

Wait, I think the reaction is about making an acyl bromide. Wait, acetic acid (CH3COOH) reacting with Br2 in pyridine. Oh, wait, I think that's the method to make acetyl bromide. So, acetic acid would lose a water molecule and gain Br. So, the product would be CH3COBr. Because when you have a carboxylic acid reacting with Br2 in pyridine, it forms the acyl bromide. So product 1 is acetyl bromide, CH3COBr.

Step 2: Product 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2. So, acetyl bromide (CH3COBr) reacting with ethanol. That sounds like an nucleophilic acyl substitution. Ethanol's -OH would attack the carbonyl carbon, and the bromide would leave. So, product 2 would be ethyl acetate. Wait, because CH3COBr + ethanol → CH3CO-OEt (ethyl acetate) plus HBr. But wait, the reaction conditions are heating and H2SO4. Oh, wait, that sounds more like an acid-catalyzed esterification. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution where the Br is replaced by an OEt group. So, yes, product 2 is ethyl acetate, which is an ester.

So, product 2 is ethyl acetate, CH3COOCH2CH3.

Step 3: Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3. Sodium cyanide (NaCN) is a good nucleophile. So, ethyl acetate (CH3COOCH2CH3) reacting with CN-.

Wait, esters reacting with CN-... I think that's a nucleophilic acyl substitution. So the ester would be converted to an acyl cyanide. So, the ester group OCH2CH3 would be replaced by CN. So, product 3 would be CH3COCN, which is acetonitrile, but wait, no. Wait, wait. The structure of ethyl acetate is CH3CO-OCH2CH3. When CN- attacks, it would substitute the OEt group. So the product would be CH3CO-CN, which is acetyl cyanide, or ethanenitrile. Wait, no, acetonitrile is (CH3)2C≡N. Wait, no, maybe it's CH3CO-CN, which is propanenitrile? Let me think. The ester is CH3CO-OCH2CH3. Replacing the OCH2CH3 with CN gives CH3CO-CN. So that's acetyl cyanide, which is propanenitrile. So product 3 is CH3CO-CN.

Alternatively, wait, maybe I'm wrong. Another possibility is that the ester is saponified, but NaCN is a weak base, but I don't think so. No, the reaction is more likely nucleophilic substitution of the ester group. So, product 3 is CH3CO-CN.

Step 4: Product 3 is treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming product 4. Sodium hydride is a strong base, and 1,5-dibromopentane is a dihalide. So, perhaps an elimination or alkylation reaction is happening here.

Wait, product 3 is CH3CO-CN. If we treat that with a strong base like NaH, what happens? Well, NaH is a strong base, so maybe it deprotonates something. But where are the protons in CH3CO-CN? The carbonyl groups are adjacent to CH3 and CN. The CH3 is attached to the carbonyl, so the alpha protons (the CH3) are acidic. So, NaH would deprotonate the CH3 group, making a carbanion. Then, that carbanion would react with 1,5-dibromopentane.

Wait, but 1,5-dibromopentane is (CH2Br)CH2CH2CH2CH2Br. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the dibromide is acting as an alkylating agent. Wait, when a carbanion is formed, it can attack an alkylating agent. So, CH3CO-CN treated with NaH would form CH2-CO-CN^- (but wait, maybe it's CH2- after deprotonation). So, the carbanion would attack the dibromide.

Wait, 1,5-dibromopentane has two Br atoms on a five-carbon chain. So, when the carbanion attacks one of the Br in 1,5-dibromopentane, it would substitute the Br. Since there are two Br atoms, but the solution uses excess NaH and dibromopentane, perhaps both positions are alkylated.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material is CH3CO-CN. Let me think:

CH3CO-CN → after deprotonation → CH2CO-CN^- (but wait, actually, deprotonating the CH3 group would give a carbanion at the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl, so it's CH2^-CO-CN. Now, when this carbanion attacks an alkylating agent (1,5-dibromopentane), it will perform an SN2 substitution at each of the two Br positions. But since there are two Br atoms in 1,5-dibromopentane, each at the ends of a five-carbon chain, perhaps each substitution occurs on the same carbon? Or maybe each substitution happens in a way that adds a five-carbon group.

Wait, but 1,5-dibromopentane is BrCH2CH2CH2CH2CH2Br. So, each end is a Br on a CH2 group, with three CH2 in between. So, when the carbanion attacks one Br, it will add a five-carbon chain. But wait, it's a di-substituted bromide.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. If the starting material is CH3CO-CN, after deprotonation, it becomes CH2CO-CN^-.

Then, this anion attacks the 1,5-dibromopentane, which is a vicinal dihalide. Wait, no, 1,5-dibromopentane is actually BrCH2CH2CH2CH2CH2Br. So, each Br is on the first and fifth carbon of a pentane chain.

Wait, but when the carbanion attacks the dibromide, perhaps each Br is a leaving group. But how would that work? Alternatively, perhaps the carbanion attacks each Br in a substitution, leading to the addition of two pentyl groups?

Wait, but if the carbanion attacks one Br, it would add the pentyl group (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-). So, after one substitution, the structure would become CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-CO-CN. Wait, but wait, the substitution would add a pentyl group to the carbonyl.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The initial carbanion is CH2^- (from CH3CO-CN, which after deprotonation is CH2^-CO-CN).

When this carbanion attacks 1,5-dibromopentane, it would perform an SN2 substitution. The structure of 1,5-dibromopentane is:

Br-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Br

Each Br is on the first and fifth carbon.

So, when the carbanion (CH2^-) attacks one of the Br atoms, it would substitute that Br, adding a (CH2)4CH2- group to the carbanion.

Wait, no. Let's think: the carbanion is at the end of the carbon chain. So, the attack would be on the adjacent carbon. Wait, perhaps it's more like this: the carbanion has a negative charge on the CH2, which is adjacent to the carbonyl. So, when it attacks the dibromide, perhaps it attacks one of the Br atoms, substituting and adding a chain.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the overall process. The starting carbanion has a negative charge on the CH2 group next to the carbonyl. When it reacts with 1,5-dibromopentane, it will substitute each Br. However, considering that the reagent is in excess and that the reaction is probably done under conditions that allow for multiple substitutions.

Wait, but wait: 1,5-dibromopentane has two Br atoms on the same molecule. So, perhaps when the carbanion attacks one Br, the molecule will lose that Br and the chain will add to the carbanion. But then, is there another Br on the same molecule that can be attacked?

Wait, perhaps the initial attack would add a pentyl group (from one Br) to the carbanion.

But then, after that, perhaps the other Br in 1,5-dibromopentane would be attacked again by the carbanion.

Wait, but that seems unlikely because after the first substitution, the carbanion would have a pentyl group attached. Let me draw this out in my mind.

Original structure: CH3-CO-CN → deprotonate → CH2^--CO-CN.

Reaction with 1,5-dibromopentane:

The carbanion attacks one Br (say, the first Br), leading to the substitution of that Br with the pentyl group. So the structure becomes CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-CO-CN. But wait, that would be a substitution on the same carbon? No, that's probably not correct.

Wait, perhaps the 1,5-dibromopentane is a di-substituted alkyl halide, so when the carbanion attacks, it can attack each Br in turn, adding two pentyl groups.

Wait, but wait, the carbanion has a single negative charge. How can it attack both Br atoms? Unless each Br is in a different molecule. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double alkylation. So the carbanion attacks each Br once, leading to two pentyl groups being added.

Wait, but that would require the carbanion to attack two different bromides. But each molecule of dibromopentane has two Br atoms. So perhaps the first substitution adds a pentyl group, and the second substitution would come from another molecule of dibromopentane's Br.

But wait, the product is formed after treating with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane. So maybe each Br in the dibromide is attacked once, leading to two substitutions.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The initial molecule is CH3CO-CN. After deprotonation, it's CH2^-CO-CN.

When this reacts with 1,5-dibromopentane, each Br can be attacked in an SN2 reaction, leading to substitution. So each Br in dibromopentane is a leaving group, and each substitution would add a pentyl group to the carbanion.

But since the dibromide is 1,5-dibromopentane, each Br is on the first and fifth carbon of a five-carbon chain. So when the carbanion attacks one Br, it adds a four-carbon chain? Wait, no. Wait, the structure is:

Br-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Br.

So, each Br is on a CH2 group, with four CH2 groups in between.

When the carbanion attacks the Br at position 1, it would substitute it, resulting in the carbanion being attached to the CH2 in position 1. So the product would be CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-CO-CN, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the substitution wrong. Let me think. The carbanion (CH2^-) would attack the carbon adjacent to the Br. So, in 1,5-dibromopentane, when the Br is at position 1, the adjacent carbon is position 2. So the substitution would form a new bond between the carbanion's carbon and the carbon where Br was, right?

Wait, no. In an SN2 reaction, the nucleophile attacks the electrophilic carbon (the one bearing the leaving group), so the Br is on C1. The nucleophile (carbanion) attacks C1, pushing the Br out. So the product would be the carbanion attached to C1, which is now bonded to the carbanion and the rest of the chain.

Wait, perhaps the product would be:

After substitution, the structure becomes (CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-) attached to the carbanion. So the molecule would be (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CO-CN) ?

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting the bonding wrong. Let me think again.

The carbanion is CH2^--CO-CN. It attacks the C1 of 1,5-dibromopentane (which is Br-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Br). The C1 is the first carbon, which has a Br. So the nucleophilic attack would substitute the Br on C1. So the product would have a CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2- group attached to the C where the Br was, which is now bonded to the carbanion.

Wait, so the product after one substitution would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO-CN, but that doesn't seem right because the carbanion is a CH2 group.

Wait, maybe it's better to write the structure as:

After substitution, the carbanion (CH2^-) is connected to the first carbon of the pentane chain, so the structure becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO-CN. But that would mean the CH2 is the first carbon, and the rest are attached. So the full structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO-CN, but that's a six-carbon chain. Wait, no, because the starting chain was five carbons, so perhaps the structure is (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)-CO-CN, but that's five carbons plus the CO-CN, making it seven.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about the overall process. The initial compound is CH3CO-CN. After deprotonation, we have a strong nucleophile (carbanion) which can attack the 1,5-dibromopentane. Each Br in the dibromide can be substituted, so the carbanion can attack each Br once, leading to two substitutions.

Wait, but would the same carbanion attack both Br atoms in the same dibromide molecule? That would require a very specific scenario, perhaps in a concerted process, which is unlikely. More probably, each Br is in a different molecule, so each substitution occurs on a different molecule of dibromide.

Alternatively, perhaps the carbanion can attack each Br once, leading to two substitutions, adding two pentyl groups.

If that's the case, then the product would have two pentyl groups attached to the central carbon. So the structure would be (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2-CO-CN.

Wait, but the starting carbanion is CH2^--CO-CN. So, adding two pentyl groups would give (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2-CO-CN. But that's perhaps more like two pentyl groups attached to a central carbon connected to the CO-CN group.

Wait, but actually, when the carbanion attacks, each substitution would add a chain. So, perhaps each substitution adds a five-carbon chain. So, the initial CH2^- would become CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH2-O-CO-CN? No, wait, that's not correct. Let me think in terms of structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the carbanion is at the CH2, which is adjacent to the carbonyl. So, when it attacks a dibromide, it substitutes the Br, adding a chain.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as the carbanion attacking each Br once, leading to two pentyl groups being added to the central carbon.

So, the product would be (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2-CO-CN. So, the central carbon (originally the CH2) now has two pentyl groups attached.

Wait, but that would make the structure (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2-CO-CN. Wait, but that's a bit ambiguous. Let me draw it as:

(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2-CO-CN → but more accurately, the structure would be:

CH2( after substitution ) → CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2- connected twice to the same carbon.

So, the product after two substitutions would be (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2CO-CN.

Wait, but that would be a geminal di-substitution. Is that feasible? Maybe so, if the conditions are right. Alternatively, perhaps the two substitutions occur on adjacent carbons, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps each substitution adds a five-carbon chain, leading to a structure where the central carbon is connected to two pentyl groups and the CO-CN group.

Wait, but the starting material is CH3CO-CN. After losing a proton, it's CH2^--CO-CN. Each substitution with 1,5-dibromopentane would add a five-carbon chain (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-) to the CH2^-, making it CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH2-CO-CN, but that's only one substitution. Wait, but perhaps I'm missing something. If we have excess dibromopentane and excess NaH, perhaps two substitutions occur, leading to two pentyl groups attached to the CH2.

So, the structure would be CH2(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2CO-CN.

Wait, but that would mean the CH2 carbon is attached to two pentyl groups and the CO-CN group. So, that's a possible structure.

Alternatively, maybe the dibromopentane is a vicinal dihalide, but I think 1,5-dibromopentane is a dihalide on the ends of a five-carbon chain.

So, the final product 4 would have a structure where the central carbon (originally from CH3) is attached to two pentyl groups and the CO-CN group.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me think about this again. The initial structure after deprotonation is CH2^--CO-CN. When this reacts with 1,5-dibromopentane, each Br can be substituted. So, each substitution adds a five-carbon chain to the CH2.

But wait, 1,5-dibromopentane is (CH2Br)CH2CH2CH2CH2Br. So each substitution would add a (CH2)4CH2 group to the CH2^-. But wait, no: the substitution would add a (CH2)4CH2 group, but starting from each Br.

Wait, perhaps each substitution adds a (CH2)4CH2 group, so the product would have two such groups attached to the central carbon.

So the product 4 would be:

(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2-C(O)-CN.

Wait, but wait, I think I might have miscounted. Let me check the structure again.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is CH2(CO-CN)(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2. But that would be a central carbon with three substituents: CO-CN and two pentyl groups.

Wait, but the central carbon can only form four bonds. So, if the original CH2 group (from CH3CO-CN) becomes CH2^-- after deprotonation, adding two substituents would require the fourth bond to be something else. Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated, but I'll proceed.

Assuming that the product 4 is (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2-CO-CN, the structure would be a central carbon connected to two pentyl groups and the CO-CN group.

Wait, but that would mean the central carbon is CH2. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is more like:

CH2(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2-C(=O)-CN.

Wait, but that might not be possible because the central carbon can only have four bonds. So perhaps I'm getting this wrong and the substitution occurs differently.

Alternatively, perhaps each substitution adds a four-carbon group. Wait, wait, 1,5-dibromopentane has five carbons, so the substitution would add a four-carbon chain? No, because the Br is on the first carbon, so when substituted, the chain added would be four carbons plus the Br's carbon, making a five-carbon chain.

Wait, perhaps the substitution adds a four-carbon chain, but that would make the product a butyl group, not pentyl. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is not substitution but alkylation through elimination. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should move forward and think about the structure of product 4, assuming that the central carbon is attached to two pentyl groups and the CO-CN group.

So, product 4's structure would be (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2-C(O)-CN.

But wait, that would mean the central carbon has three groups: two pentyl and one CO-CN. But that's only three substituents. To have four bonds, perhaps there's a hydrogen left. But that doesn't make sense because the starting CH2^- would have a negative charge, and upon substitution, it would gain two R groups.

Wait, maybe it's better to think that each substitution adds a five-carbon chain, so the structure becomes:

(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2-CO-CN.

But in this case, the central carbon is the one that was the CH2 from the original acetonitrile. So, each substitution adds a five-carbon chain, making the structure (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2-CO-CN. So, the central carbon is connected to two pentyl groups and the carbonyl group.

Wait, but in that case, the central carbon would have three substituents: two pentyl groups and the CO-CN group. That leaves it with a single bond, so perhaps a hydrogen is present. So the structure would be CH2(CO-CN)(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2. But that would have four substituents: two CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2 groups, the CO-CN group, and a hydrogen. So the structure would be CH2(CO-CN)(pentyl)2.

Wait, but that might not be possible because that central carbon would be CH2, so it can only have two substituents. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a geminal di-substitution, where two pentyl groups are added to the same carbon. So the structure would be (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2CO-CN, but I'm not sure about the bonding.

Well, perhaps I should proceed with this structure and then think about the NMR.

Assuming that product 4 has a structure where the central carbon is attached to two pentyl groups and a CO-CN group, perhaps as (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2CO-CN.

Wait, but that can't be correct because the central carbon would have three groups (two pentyl and one CO-CN) plus a hydrogen, making four bonds. So, the structure would be CH2(CO-CN)(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2.

But perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the substitution occurs once, adding a single pentyl group to the CH2^--CO-CN, resulting in CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CO-CN. But that would only be one substitution, and the problem states that excess NaH and dibromopentane are used, so perhaps two substitutions occur.

Wait, but 1,5-dibromopentane has two Br atoms. So each Br can be substituted once, leading to two substitutions. So, the product would have two pentyl groups attached to the same carbon.

So, the structure would be (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2CO-CN, with the central carbon being connected to two pentyl groups and the CO-CN group, plus a hydrogen. So that would be CH2(CO-CN)(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2.

Wait, but that would mean the central carbon is a CH2 group with two pentyl groups and the CO-CN group attached. So, the structure would be:

(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2-CO-CN, but with the CH2 in the middle connected to all these groups.

Now, considering this structure, what would the NMR look like?

Let me list the different types of hydrogens:

1. The CO-CN group: probably no hydrogens attached.
2. The central CH2 group, attached to two pentyl groups and the CO-CN. So, this CH2 would have two equivalent H's if the substituents are the same on both sides. But wait, the two pentyl groups are identical, so the CH2 would be a single environment, giving one signal.

But wait, the two pentyl groups are identical, so the central CH2 would have two H's in an equivalent environment, giving a singlet.

Then, each pentyl group would have its own set of H's. A pentyl group is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3, but in this case, it's attached to the central CH2.

Wait, but in the product, each pentyl group is attached to the central carbon. So each pentyl group is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. So, each of these chains would have H's in different environments.

Let me think about the symmetry. Since both pentyl groups are identical and attached to the same central carbon, the two pentyl groups would be mirror images of each other. So, the H's in each position of the pentyl chains would be equivalent between the two chains.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me consider each pentyl group attached to the central CH2.

Each pentyl chain is -(CH2)4-CH3.

So, the first CH2 group (attached to the central carbon) would have two H's, but since both sides are identical, these would be equivalent. The next CH2 would also have two H's. Similarly, the third and fourth CH2 groups would each have two H's. Finally, the terminal CH3 has three H's.

Wait, but if the two pentyl groups are identical and symmetrically placed, then the H's in each position of the pentyl chains would be equivalent between the two chains. So, each position in the pentyl chains would have equivalent H's, leading to fewer signals.

But wait, what about the central CH2 group?

Let me outline all the H's:

- Central CH2 (from the substitution): 2 H's, equivalent, so one signal.
- Each pentyl group: each chain has five carbons.

Wait, each pentyl group is attached to the central CH2. So each pentyl chain is as follows:

- Position 1: attached to central CH2 → CH2- (two H's)
- Position 2: CH2- (two H's)
- Position 3: CH2- (two H's)
- Position 4: CH2- (two H's)
- Position 5: CH3 (three H's)

But since both pentyl groups are identical and symmetrically placed, the H's in each position of one pentyl group are equivalent to the same position in the other pentyl group.

Therefore, the H's in each position (1, 2, 3, 4) would each form one signal, and the terminal CH3 would form another.

So, counting the signals:

1. Central CH2: 1 signal (singlet, 2 H's)
2. Each of the four CH2 groups in the pentyl chains: each would have equivalent H's on both pentyl groups. So four more signals (each with 2 H's)
3. The terminal CH3 groups: one signal (two CH3 groups, each with 3 H's; but wait, there are two CH3 groups from each pentyl chain, but they are equivalent, so one signal).

Wait, but perhaps the CH2 groups in the pentyl chains are not all equivalent. For example, the first CH2 (attached to the central CH2) would be in a different environment than the others. So each CH2 in the pentyl chain would have a distinct environment, leading to four different H environments in the pentyl chains.

Wait, but perhaps due to the symmetry, the two pentyl groups being mirror images would have their H's in equivalent positions. So, the first CH2 group (attached to central CH2) would have H's that are equivalent between the two pentyl chains. Similarly, the next CH2 groups would also be equivalent.

So, in the NMR, the signals from the pentyl chains would be:

- The CH2 next to the central CH2: one signal (two H's each, two groups → total four H's)
- The next CH2: another signal (two H's each, two groups → total four H's)
- The third CH2: another signal (two H's each → four H's)
- The fourth CH2: another signal (two H's each → four H's)
- The terminal CH3: one signal (two CH3 groups, each three H's → total six H's)

But wait, perhaps the central CH2 is symmetric, leading to the CH2 groups in the pentyl chains being in equivalent environments. So each CH2 in the same position in both chains would have the same chemical shift.

So, each CH2 position in the pentyl chains would contribute one signal, and the terminal CH3 would contribute another.

So, total signals from the pentyl chains would be four (from the four CH2 groups) plus one (from the CH3), making five.

Plus the central CH2: 1.

Wait, but I think I'm missing something. Let me recount:

- Central CH2: 1 signal
- Each of the four CH2 groups in the pentyl chains: each contributes 1 signal → 4 signals
- The terminal CH3: 1 signal

Total: 1 + 4 + 1 = 6 signals.

But wait, the product has two pentyl groups. So for each CH2 in the pentyl chains, the H's on both chains are equivalent. So each CH2 position contributes one signal.

Wait, but each CH2 in the pentyl chain is part of a longer chain. So the first CH2 (next to the central CH2) would be in a different environment than the others. So each CH2 in the pentyl chain is a unique environment.

Wait, but perhaps not. Let me think about the symmetry. The molecule would be symmetric only if the two pentyl groups are mirror images. So, the H's on the first CH2 of each pentyl group are equivalent. Similarly, the H's on the second CH2 of each pentyl group are equivalent, and so on.

So, for the pentyl chains:

- Each CH2 group in the same position (1, 2, 3, 4) in each pentyl group has equivalent H's → each contributes one signal.

So, four signals from the CH2 groups (positions 1-4) and one signal from the terminal CH3.

So, in total:

- Central CH2: 1
- CH2 in position 1 (each pentyl): 1
- CH2 in position 2: 1
- CH2 in position 3: 1
- CH2 in position 4: 1
- CH3: 1

Total of 6 signals.

Wait, but the options given are 5,8,10,12. So 6 isn't an option. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a different structure. Maybe the substitution only happens once, leading to a single pentyl group attached.

Wait, but the problem says to use excess sodium hydride and dibromopentane. So perhaps two substitutions occur, leading to two pentyl groups.

If that's the case, then perhaps the structure has two pentyl groups attached to the same carbon.

Wait, but perhaps the product is a secondary amine or something else. Hmm, perhaps I made a wrong assumption earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps the substitution adds a single pentyl group, leading to only one substitution.

Wait, if product 4 is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CO-CN, then the H's would be:

- Central CH2 (attached to CO-CN): 2 H's → 1 signal.
- The pentyl chain's CH2 groups: four CH2 groups, each with two H's. Each would be a distinct environment, leading to four signals.
- The terminal CH3: 3 H's → 1 signal.

So total signals would be 1 (central CH2) + 4 (each CH2 in pentyl) + 1 (CH3) = 6. But again, 6 isn't an option.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the structure of product 4.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about each reaction step again.

Step 1: Acetic acid + Br2, pyridine, acetic anhydride → acetyl bromide (CH3COBr).

Step 2: CH3COBr + ethanol, H2SO4 → ethyl acetate (CH3COOCH2CH3).

Step 3: CH3COOCH2CH3 + NaCN → CH3CO-CN.

Step 4: CH3CO-CN + excess NaH, 1,5-dibromopentane → ?

Wait, perhaps step 4 is a nucleophilic substitution on the nitrile. Wait, nitriles are generally not very reactive towards nucleophilic substitution, but under strong basic conditions, perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps the NaH deprotonates the nitrile. Wait, nitriles are not very acidic, but under strong basic conditions, maybe the alpha protons (the CH3 in CH3CO-CN) could be deprotonated.

So, CH3CO-CN → NaH → CH2^-CO-CN.

Then, 1,5-dibromopentane would react with this carbanion.

In this case, each substitution of Br would add a pentyl group.

So, perhaps each Br in the dibromide is substituted once, leading to two pentyl groups attached to the central carbon.

So, the structure would be (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2-CO-CN.

Wait, but in that case, the central carbon is attached to two pentyl groups and the CO-CN group, plus a hydrogen.

So, the structure would be CH2(CO-CN)(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2.

Now, for the NMR, the hydrogens would be:

1. The central CH2: 2 H's → 1 signal.
2. Each pentyl chain's CH2 groups. Since the two pentyl chains are symmetrical, their CH2 groups would have equivalent H's. So each CH2 position (positions 1-4) would contribute one signal.
3. The terminal CH3 groups: each has three H's, and since there are two identical CH3 groups, they contribute one signal.

Wait, but each pentyl group is five carbons long. So, the CH2 attached to the central CH2 is the first position, then the next CH2 is position 2, and so on, with the terminal CH3 being position 5.

So, the H's in each position (1,2,3,4) of the pentyl chains would each contribute a signal.

So, for each position in the pentyl chains:

- Position 1 (attached to central CH2): two CH2 groups, each with two H's → one signal.
- Position 2: each pentyl has a CH2 here, but since the two pentyl groups are symmetrical, their H's are equivalent → one signal.
- Similarly for positions 3 and 4.
- Position 5 (CH3): two CH3 groups, each with three H's → one signal.

So, from the pentyl chains: 4 signals (positions 1-4) + 1 (CH3) = 5.

Plus the central CH2: 1 signal.

Total: 6 signals.

But the options don't include 6. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the two pentyl groups are not symmetrical, leading to each CH2 group in the two pentyl chains having different environments. But that would complicate things, but in reality, the two pentyl groups are identical and attached symmetrically, so their H's should be equivalent.

Wait, perhaps the central CH2 is a CH2 group, but the two pentyl groups are on the same carbon. So, the H's on the central CH2 are split into two different environments due to the substituents.

Wait, no. The central CH2 is attached to two identical pentyl groups and the CO-CN group. So, the two H's on the central CH2 would be equivalent, giving a singlet.

So, perhaps the total is:

- Central CH2: 1
- Each CH2 in the pentyl chain: 4 positions → 4 signals
- Terminal CH3: 1.

Total: 6.

But again, 6 isn't an option. So perhaps I'm wrong about the number of signals from the pentyl chains.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe each substitution leads to a chain addition, but the product isn't a symmetric molecule. For example, perhaps the two pentyl groups are added in a way that one is on one side and the other is on another, leading to different environments for each CH2 group.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure isn't symmetric, leading to more signals.

Wait, but if the two pentyl groups are attached to the same carbon, the molecule would be symmetrical. So, the CH2 groups in equivalent positions in the two pentyl chains would have the same chemical shift.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the dibromide adds two pentyl groups to the nitrile group, but each substitution is on the same carbon, leading to a geminal di-substitution. So, the structure becomes CH2(CO-CN)(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2.

In that case, the central CH2 group's H's would be equivalent, giving one signal.

Each pentyl chain's CH2 groups would have four different environments, leading to four signals, and the CH3 would give another.

So, total of 1 (central) + 4 (pentyl CH2) + 1 (CH3) = 6 signals. But again, 6 isn't an option.

Hmm, maybe I made a wrong assumption about the product structure. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the product is a primary amine or something else. No, the steps don't suggest that.

Alternatively, perhaps the substitution doesn't occur on the nitrile. Maybe the -CO-CN is not reactive, and the substitution occurs elsewhere.

Wait, but where else is there a nucleophilic site? The NaH would deprotonate any acidic H. The nitrile's alpha position (the CH3 in CH3CO-CN) has H's that are somewhat acidic, so they would be deprotonated.

But perhaps the reaction is different. Maybe the NaH and dibromopentane are used for a different purpose, like forming an enolate or something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an alkylation of the nitrile, adding an alkyl group to the carbon adjacent to the nitrile.

Wait, nitriles can undergo alkylation under certain conditions. So, perhaps the product is an alkyl nitrile.

If the NaH deprotonates the nitrile's alpha H, forming a carbanion, which then reacts with 1,5-dibromopentane. But perhaps each substitution adds a pentyl group, leading to a di-substituted product.

Wait, but perhaps the nitrile's structure after substitution would be (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C(O)CN. No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2CO-CN, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the NMR signals again. The options are 5, 8, 10, 12.

If the product has five signals, perhaps the structure is such that many H's are in equivalent environments.

Wait, perhaps the product is a benzene ring with substituents leading to symmetry. But I don't think so, given the reaction steps.

Wait, perhaps the final product is a straight-chain molecule with multiple equivalent H's. For example, if the molecule has 10 H's in equivalent positions, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclic structure, but I don't think so.

Wait, another approach: Let me think about each step again and see if I made a mistake in the product structures.

Step 1: Acetic acid → acetyl bromide (CH3COBr).

Step 2: Acetyl bromide + ethanol → ethyl acetate (CH3COOCH2CH3).

Step 3: Ethyl acetate + NaCN → CH3CO-CN (acetyl cyanide).

Step 4: CH3CO-CN treated with excess NaH and 1,5-dibromopentane.

Wait, perhaps in step 4, the NaH deprotonates the nitrile's alpha H (CH3), forming CH2^-CO-CN. Then, this reacts with 1,5-dibromopentane.

Each substitution would add a pentyl group to the CH2.

So, after two substitutions, the structure would be (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2CO-CN.

So, the molecule would have a central carbon attached to two pentyl groups and the CO-CN group.

Now, the NMR would have:

- The central CH2: 2 H's → 1 signal.
- Each pentyl group's CH2 groups: four positions, each with two H's. But since the two pentyl groups are symmetrical, each position contributes one signal.
- The terminal CH3: 3 H's → 1 signal.

So, that's 1 (central) + 4 (CH2) + 1 (CH3) = 6 signals.

But the options don't have 6, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the structure is different. Maybe the substitution occurs on the nitrile's adjacent carbon, leading to a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile doesn't undergo substitution, and another part of the molecule does.

Wait, another possibility: NaH is a strong base and can deprotonate the nitrile's alpha H, leading to a carbanion. Then, 1,5-dibromopentane, which is a vicinal dihalide, could undergo an elimination reaction, forming an alkyne. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an elimination, forming a triple bond. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the NaH and dibromopentane are used to form a Grignard-like reagent, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the product as having a tertiary carbon attached to two pentyl groups and a carbonyl group. But then, the central carbon would be CH, not CH2, which complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the substitution leads to a branching, making the structure have more distinct H environments.

Wait, another approach: Each substitution adds a five-carbon chain, but perhaps the two substitutions are on adjacent carbons, leading to a branching.

But I'm not sure. This is getting a bit too tangled.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a secondary alcohol, but that doesn't fit the reaction steps.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the number of signals without knowing the exact structure. Let me think about possible scenarios.

If the product has a lot of symmetry, the number of signals would be fewer. For example, if the molecule is symmetric, some H's would be equivalent.

If the product is a straight-chain molecule with all CH2 groups, the number of signals would be fewer. For example, in a straight-chain alkane, each CH2 would have a unique environment, leading to multiple signals.

But in this case, with two pentyl groups attached symmetrically, perhaps the number of signals would be fewer.

Wait, let's imagine the product is (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2CO-CN.

The central CH2 would have two H's → 1 signal.

Each pentyl group would have:

- Position 1: CH2 attached to central CH2 → 2 H's → 1 signal (since both pentyl groups are the same)
- Position 2: CH2 →2 H's → 1 signal
- Position 3: CH2 →2 H's →1 signal
- Position 4: CH2 →2 H's →1 signal
- Position 5: CH3 →3 H's →1 signal

So, from the pentyl groups: 4 (positions 1-4) + 1 (CH3) =5 signals.

Plus the central CH2:1 → total 6.

Hmm, but the options don't include 6. So perhaps my initial assumption about the structure is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the NaH and dibromopentane are used to form a tertiary amine, but I don't see how that would happen given the reagents.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an ester or an amide, but I don't think so.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the NaH deprotonates the nitrile's alpha H, forming a carbanion, which then attacks one Br in the dibromide, leading to a single substitution. So the product would have one pentyl group attached.

If that's the case, the structure would be CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CO-CN.

In that case, the H's would be:

- Central CH2: 2 H's →1 signal
- Each CH2 in the pentyl chain: four CH2 groups, each with 2 H's → four signals
- Terminal CH3:3 H's →1 signal

Total: 1 +4 +1=6.

Again, 6 isn't an option.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me think about the options again.

The options are A)8, B)5, C)10, D)12.

Wait, perhaps the product has 8 signals. How?

If each substitution leads to a different environment, perhaps the molecule isn't symmetrical, leading to more signals.

Wait, perhaps each substitution adds a different chain, but that's unlikely since the same reagent is used.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a branched alkane with multiple unique H environments.

Wait, another idea: Perhaps the product is a cyclic structure, but I'm not seeing how that would form from the given reagents.

Alternatively, perhaps the product has a longer chain with multiple substituents, leading to more distinct H's.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are added in such a way that each CH2 group in the chain has a different environment, leading to more signals.

Wait, but without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to count the signals accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recount the steps again to see if I missed something.

Step 4: Product 3 is CH3CO-CN. Treated with excess NaH and 1,5-dibromopentane.

NaH deprotonates the alpha H of the nitrile, forming CH2^-CO-CN.

This anion attacks 1,5-dibromopentane. Each Br in the dibromide can be substituted, leading to two pentyl groups attached.

So, the structure is (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2CO-CN.

Now, for the NMR:

- The central CH2: 2 H's → 1 signal (singlet)
- Each pentyl group's first CH2 (attached to central CH2): 2 H's each → since both pentyl groups are identical, this is one signal (two H's from each CH2 → total four H's, but it's a singlet)
- The second CH2 in each pentyl: 2 H's each →1 signal (two groups, total four H's)
- The third CH2: same →1 signal
- The fourth CH2: same →1 signal
- The terminal CH3: 3 H's each from two CH3 groups →1 signal (total six H's)

So, that's 1 (central) + 1 (position 1) +1 (position 2) +1 (position3) +1 (position4) +1 (CH3) →6 signals.

But 6 isn't an option. So perhaps the substituents are arranged differently.

Wait, perhaps the two pentyl groups are attached to adjacent carbons, leading to more distinct H environments.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2(CO-CN)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Br, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the substitution occurs at a different position.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, leading to a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a tertiary alcohol, but I don't see how that would form.

At this point, I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options.

If the structure has 5 signals, that would correspond to option B. But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a single pentyl group substituted, leading to 5 signals, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the product is a secondary alcohol, but I don't think the steps lead to that.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a benzyl-type structure, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the product is a di-substituted alkane with a central CH2 connected to two pentyl groups and a CO-CN group. In that case, the NMR would have the following:

- Central CH2: 2 H's →1 signal
- Each pentyl group's CH2: 4 signals (positions 1-4)
- Terminal CH3:1 signal

Total 6 signals. But no option for 6.

Alternatively, perhaps the CO-CN group is attached to a carbon that's part of a ring, but I don't see how that would form.

Hmm. Well, I'm going to have to make an educated guess here. Perhaps the product has 8 signals, leading to option A.

Wait, why 8? Maybe each substitution adds a chain with four unique CH2 groups, leading to more signals.

Alternatively, perhaps the product has a branching that leads to more distinct H environments.

Wait, perhaps the product is a di-substituted alkane with two pentyl groups leading to 8 signals.

Alternatively, perhaps each substitution adds a four-carbon chain, leading to more signals.

But I'm not sure. Given the options, I'll go with option B)5.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence, and the goal is to determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the final product's $^1$H NMR spectrum. Here's the analysis of each step:

1. **Step 1**: Acetic acid (CH$_3$COOH) reacts with bromine (Br$_2$), pyridine, and acetic anhydride under heating. This is a nucleophilic acyl substitution, forming acetyl bromide (CH$_3$COBr).

2. **Step 2**: Acetyl bromide (CH$_3$COBr) reacts with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid. This is an acid-catalyzed nucleophilic acyl substitution, forming ethyl acetate (CH$_3$COOCH$_2$CH$_3$).

3. **Step 3**: Ethyl acetate (CH$_3$COOCH$_2$CH$_3$) reacts with sodium cyanide (NaCN). This is a nucleophilic acyl substitution, replacing the ethoxy group with a cyano group, forming acetyl cyanide (CH$_3$CO-CN).

4. **Step 4**: Acetyl cyanide (CH$_3$CO-CN) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (BrCH$_2$CH$_2$CH$_2$CH$_2$CH$_2$Br). Sodium hydride deprotonates the alpha hydrogen of the nitrile, forming a carbanion (CH$_2$CO-CN$^-$). This carbanion undergoes two nucleophilic substitutions with 1,5-dibromopentane, resulting in a geminal di-substitution. The final product is (CH$_2$CH$_2$CH$_2$CH$_2$CH$_2$)$_2$CO-CN, where the central carbon is attached to two pentyl groups and the CO-CN group.

### Analysis of the $^1$H NMR Spectrum of the Final Product
The final product, (CH$_2$CH$_2$CH$_2$CH$_2$CH$_2$)$_2$CO-CN, has the following distinct hydrogen environments:

1. **Central CH$_2$**: The central carbon is attached to two pentyl groups and the CO-CN group. The two hydrogens on this carbon are equivalent, giving one signal.

2. **Pentyl Chains**:
   - **Position 1 (CH$_2$ attached to the central CH$_2$)**: Each pentyl chain has a CH$_2$ group at this position. Since the two pentyl chains are identical and symmetrically placed, the hydrogens on these CH$_2$ groups are equivalent, giving one signal.
   - **Position 2 (CH$_2$)**: Similarly, the hydrogens on the CH$_2$ groups at this position in both pentyl chains are equivalent, giving one signal.
   - **Position 3 (CH$_2$)**: The hydrogens on the CH$_2$ groups at this position in both pentyl chains are equivalent, giving one signal.
   - **Position 4 (CH$_2$)**: The hydrogens on the CH$_2$ groups at this position in both pentyl chains are equivalent, giving one signal.
   - **Position 5 (CH$_3$)**: The terminal CH$_3$ groups in both pentyl chains are equivalent, giving one signal.

### Total Number of Signals
- Central CH$_2$: 1 signal
- Pentyl chains:
  - Position 1: 1 signal
  - Position 2: 1 signal
  - Position 3: 1 signal
  - Position 4: 1 signal
  - CH$_3$ (Position 5): 1 signal

Adding these together, the total number of distinct hydrogen signals is **6**. However, since 6 is not an option, the closest plausible answer based on the reasoning is **5**, which may account for potential symmetry or equivalence not explicitly considered.

ANSWER: B
