Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, I remember from my studies that Lagrangians are important in quantum field theory because they determine the dynamics of the system. The question is about the mass dimension of a coupling constant and whether the theory is renormalizable.

The Lagrangian given is 𝒜_int = κψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. I need to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable.

Wait, I should recall the basics. In QFT, each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 because the action is dimensionless (in natural units where ħ = c = 1). So each term in the Lagrangian density must have dimension 4.

The mass dimension of fields and coupling constants is important for this. The fields ψ (fermions) have a certain dimension, and F (field strength tensor) has another.

F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for a gauge field, like electromagnetism. I think the field strength F has mass dimension 2 because the gauge field A has dimension 1. F is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, so derivatives are dimension 1, and each A is dimension 1, so F is dimension 2.

The sigma matrix σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γμ, γν], which are the commutators of gamma matrices. Those are dimensionless because gamma matrices are dimensionless. So σ is dimensionless as well.

Now, the term is ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Let me break down the dimensions of each part.

ψ is a spinor field, which has mass dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ (the adjoint) also has 3/2. So ψ̄ σ ψ would be (3/2 + 3/2) = 3. Because σ is dimensionless, so that term doesn't add anything.

Then multiply by F^{μν}, which is dimension 2. So the whole term ψ̄ σ ψ F has dimension 3 + 2 =5.

Wait, but wait, the Lagrangian term must have dimension 4. So this term is part of the Lagrangian, so it must have dimension 4. So we have:

The term κ ψ̄ σ ψ F must have dimension 4. So the dimension of the entire term is [κ] + [ψ̄] + [σ] + [ψ] + [F] = [κ] + (3/2) + (3/2) + (2) = [κ] + 3 + 2 = [κ] +5. Wait, no, wait, I think I made a mistake here.

Wait, no, the Lagrangian term is 𝒜 = κ ψ̄ σ F ψ. Let me write it as κ times (ψ̄ σ ψ) times F.

Each ψ is dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ σ ψ has dimension 3/2 + 3/2 = 3. Because σ is dimensionless. Then multiply by F, which is dimension 2: 3 + 2 =5. So the entire term is dimension [κ] +5. But since it's a term in the Lagrangian, which must have dimension 4, we have [κ] +5 =4 → [κ] = -1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1. So options C or A.

Now, the second part: is the theory renormalizable?

Renormalizability depends on the mass dimension of the coupling constant. If the dimension is positive or zero, the theory is renormalizable. If it's negative (like dimension -1), the theory is non-renormalizable.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me think. The dimension of the coupling constant tells us about the superficial degree of divergence. For a theory to be renormalizable, all the coupling constants must have positive mass dimensions (or dimension zero). Because in loop integrals, higher dimension couplings would make the integrals more divergent, requiring more counterterms, but if the dimension is negative, it implies the coupling is relevant, and the theory is not renormalizable.

Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Wait, the dimension of the coupling constant is related to the scaling. The mass dimension of the coupling [g] determines the renormalizability because in a renormalizable theory, the interaction terms can have only a finite number of terms, and the coupling constants have positive or zero dimensions. Wait, no. Let me get this straight.

In four spacetime dimensions, a Lagrangian is renormalizable if each term has mass dimension ≤4. But actually, the condition is that each term must have dimension 4 because the Lagrangian density must have dimension 4. So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4. So when we write terms with coupling constants, the coupling's dimension plus the sum of the fields' dimensions must equal 4.

So, for a coupling constant g, if [g] + sum of [fields] =4, then the term is renormalizable.

But when [g] is positive, that would imply that the term is renormalizable. However, wait, no. The dimension of the coupling is determined by the term's need to have dimension 4. So for example, in scalar φ^4 theory, each φ has dimension 1. So the term g φ^4 must have dimension 4. So [g] + 4*(1) =4 → [g] =0. So g is dimensionless, and the theory is renormalizable.

In Fermi's theory of weak interactions, the interaction term is something like g ψ̄ ψ ψ̄ ψ. Each ψ is 3/2. So 3/2 *4=6. The term is dimension 4, so [g] +6=4 → [g]=-2. So the coupling has dimension -2, which is negative. Such a theory is not renormalizable because the coupling becomes relevant at low energies, requiring an infinite number of counterterms. So Fermi's theory is effective and works up to the weak scale.

Back to our problem: the coupling κ has dimension -1. So it's negative. Therefore, the theory is not renormalizable. So the theory is not renormalizable.

Wait, but wait, the interaction term is dimension 4 because [κ] is -1, and the rest gives 5, so 5 -1=4. So the term is okay. But for renormalizability, each coupling's dimension must be ≥0. So since [κ]=-1, which is negative, the theory is not renormalizable.

So the options are A: [κ]=-1, renormalizable. No. Because [κ] is -1, theory not renormalizable. So options C and D.

Looking back, option C says [κ]=-1, theory not renormalizable. Option D says +1, not renorn.

So the correct answer is C.

To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$ and $F^{\mu\nu}$ is the field strength tensor.

### Step 1: Mass dimension of the fields
- The fermion field $\psi$ has mass dimension $[\psi] = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The adjoint field $\bar{\psi}$ also has mass dimension $[\bar{\psi}] = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension $[F^{\mu\nu}] = 2$, as it is derived from the gauge field $A_\mu$, which has mass dimension $1$.

### Step 2: Mass dimension of the Lagrangian term
The term $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi$ involves the fermion fields and the dimensionless $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ matrix. The total mass dimension of this part is:
\[
[\bar{\psi}] + [\psi] + [\sigma_{\mu\nu}] = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 0 = 3.
\]
When multiplied by $F^{\mu\nu}$, the total mass dimension becomes:
\[
3 + [F^{\mu\nu}] = 3 + 2 = 5.
\]
Since the Lagrangian density must have mass dimension $4$, the coupling constant $\kappa$ must satisfy:
\[
[\kappa] + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa] = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. In this case, the coupling constant $\kappa$ has mass dimension $[\kappa] = -1$, which is negative. This implies that the theory is not renormalizable, as it would require an infinite number of counterterms to handle the divergences.

### Final Answer
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.
