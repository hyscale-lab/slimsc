Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule transitioning between energy states. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state. Wait, what's the fundamental state? Oh right, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. So it's the ground state for both rotation and vibration.

The question asks what momentum a photon should have so that the molecule switches to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the molecule is absorbing a photon, which means it's going to a higher energy state. But what's the next lowest state after the fundamental?

I remember that in molecular vibrations, the energy levels are quantized. The vibrational energy levels are given by E_vib = (v + 1/2) ħω, where v is the vibrational quantum number. For the ground state, v is 0. So the next state would be v=1, so that's an increase in energy by one vibrational quantum.

Wait, but also, the molecule can change its rotational state. Oh right, because in the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy is E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. But since this is the non-rigid rotor, maybe it's more complex. But I'm not sure how that affects the answer here.

Wait, the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So which transition would give that? The lowest energy increase would be a change in either rotation or vibration by the smallest amount. Since each quantum in vibration is ħω, and each rotational quantum is proportional to J(J+1), but for the smallest change, probably a vibrational transition would be higher because ω is given as 4e14 rad/s, which is a high frequency (like in infrared maybe). Wait, but the photon's energy is determined by the energy difference. Let's think.

Wait, but the problem says the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy. So switching to the next state. But the molecule could either go to the next vibrational state (v=1) or a higher rotational state (J increases by 1). Which one requires a lower energy photon?

Wait, in the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is h/(8π² c I), and I is the moment of inertia. I think for HCl or similar, the rotational energy levels are very close together. But for a vibrational transition, each step is ħω, which is a much larger energy jump. So, if the molecule is in the ground vibrational state, the next state is v=1, which requires a photon with energy ħω.

But the question says the molecule can switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So that would be the next possible state that's just above the current one, which is either the next rotational state or the first vibrational state.

Wait, but the molecule is in the fundamental state, so v=0, J=0? Or J can be zero but v=0. So the next state could be either J=1 or v=1.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the energy levels. The total energy is the sum of rotational and vibrational energies. The fundamental state is the lowest, which is v=0 and J=0. The next possible state could be either J=1 (with same v=0) or v=1 (with same J=0). Which transition requires less energy?

The energy difference for the rotational transition from J=0 to J=1 would be E_rot(J=1) - E_rot(J=0) = B [1(2) - 0(1)] = 2B. The energy difference for the vibrational transition from v=0 to v=1 is ħω. So which is smaller, 2B or ħω?

Hmm, I need to compute B. B is h/(8π² I), where I is the moment of inertia. I is μ r², μ being the reduced mass, r the bond length.

The given data: Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu. So the reduced mass μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (20*2)/(22) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu. To convert that to kg: 1 amu is about 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ ≈ 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.023e-27 kg.

Wait, wait, Mx is 20 amu, My is 2. So 20 * 2 =40, 20+2=22. So 40/22=20/11 ≈1.818 amu. So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ let's calculate that. 1.818 *1.6605 is roughly 3.026. So μ ≈ 3.026e-27 kg.

The bond length r is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so r=2e-10 m.

Moment of inertia I = μ r². So I = 3.026e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.026e-27 *4e-20 = 12.104e-47 kg m² = 1.2104e-46 kg m².

Then B = h/(8 π² I). Let's compute that.

h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626e-34 J s.

So B = 6.626e-34 / (8 * (pi)^2 * 1.2104e-46).

Compute denominator: 8 * pi² ≈ 8 * 9.8696 ≈ 78.9568.

Multiply by I: 78.9568 *1.2104e-46 ≈ 95.77e-46 = 9.577e-45.

So B ≈ 6.626e-34 / 9.577e-45 ≈ (6.626/9.577) * 1e11 ≈ 0.691 * 1e11 ≈ 6.91e10 s^-2.

Wait, wait, B is in cm^-1 sometimes, but in terms of energy units, 1 s^-2. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake here. Rotational energy is E_rot = B J (J+1), but B is in terms of energy per J(J+1). Wait, maybe I should compute the energy difference ΔE_rot = E(1) - E(0) = B*(2-0) = 2B.

But wait, what's the value of B in terms of energy? Because E_rot is given by (B h c) J (J+1), but maybe I confused the constants. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 2B in terms of Joules.

Wait, I think B is h/(8 π² I c), but wait, no, that's if we're using B in cm^-1. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy difference.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute B correctly. The rotational constant B is given by B = h / (8 π² I), which gives units of J s. Because I is in kg m², h is J s. So B has units of 1/(s), so B is in s^-1.

Wait, no. Let me compute B again:

h = 6.626e-34 J s.

I = 1.2104e-46 kg m².

So B = h/(8 π² I) = (6.626e-34) / (8*(pi)^2 * 1.2104e-46).

Calculating denominator: 8 * pi^2 ≈ 78.9568. 78.9568 * 1.2104e-46 ≈ 78.9568 *1.2104 = let's see, 78.9568 *1.2 is about 94.748, and .0104*78.9568 ~ 0.817, so total ≈95.565. So 95.565e-46 = 9.5565e-45.

So B = 6.626e-34 / 9.5565e-45 ≈ (6.626 /9.5565) * 1e11 ≈ 0.693 * 1e11 ≈ 6.93e10 s^-1.

Wait, so B is about 6.93e10 per second. Then ΔE_rot = 2B = 2 *6.93e10 = 1.386e11 s^-1.

Energy difference is ΔE = ħ * ΔE_rot (since E = ħ ω), but wait, no. Wait, the rotational energy is quantized as E_rot = B J (J+1) * ħ? Or is B already in terms of energy per J(J+1)?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me recheck the formula.

The correct formula for rotational energy levels is E_rot = (ħ² / (2I)) * J (J+1), where I is the moment of inertia. So B in this context is ħ²/(2I), which would be the energy per J(J+1). So the energy difference between J and J+1 is (B) (2J+1).

Wait, so for the transition from J=0 to J=1, ΔE_rot = E(1) - E(0) = B [1*(2) - 0*(1)] = 2B.

But B is ħ²/(2I). So let's compute B.

B = ħ²/(2I). ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J s.

I is 1.2104e-46 kg m².

So B = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.2104e-46).

Calculate numerator: (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68.

Denominator: 2 *1.2104e-46 ≈2.4208e-46.

So B ≈ 1.112e-68 / 2.4208e-46 ≈ approx 4.59e-23 J.

So ΔE_rot = 2 * 4.59e-23 J ≈9.18e-23 J.

Wait, but the vibrational energy difference is ħω. Let's compute that. ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J s. ω is 4e14 rad/s.

So ΔE_vib = ħω = 1.0545718e-34 *4e14 ≈4.218e-20 J.

Comparing the two: ΔE_rot is about 9.18e-23 J, and ΔE_vib is ~4.2e-20 J. So the rotational transition requires much less energy. So the next lowest state would be the rotational transition, not the vibrational one.

But wait, the problem says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the smallest possible energy increase is the rotational transition. So the photon would need to have energy equal to that ΔE_rot, which is 9.18e-23 J. But wait, the question is about momentum, not energy. So photon energy is E_photon = pc, since for photons, E = pc. So p = E_photon / c.

So E_photon = 9.18e-23 J. c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So p = 9.18e-23 / 3e8 = 3.06e-31 kg m/s. Wait, but none of the options are that small. The options are in the 1e-27 or 1e-28 range. Hmmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again. The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. So for a diatomic molecule, the fundamental state is v=0, J=0. So the next state could be either J=1 (same v=0) or v=1, J=0. We need to find which transition requires the least energy.

But according to the calculations, the rotational transition requires about 9e-23 J, and the vibrational requires 4.2e-20 J. So the rotational is lower. So the photon's energy should be 9e-23 J. Thus, momentum p = E/c = 9e-23 /3e8 =3e-31 kg m/s. But looking at the options, that's not present.

Wait, the options are in the 1e-27 order. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, maybe I confused the units. Let's recalculate B again.

Wait, B is h/(8 π² I) where I is in kg m².

h = 6.626e-34 J s. I is 1.2104e-46 kg m².

So B = 6.626e-34 / (8 * (pi^2) *1.2104e-46)

Compute denominator: 8 * pi² ≈78.9568.

Multiply by I: 78.9568 *1.2104e-46 ≈ 95.565e-46 = 9.5565e-45.

So B ≈ 6.626e-34 / 9.5565e-45 ≈6.626e-34 /9.5565e-45.

Dividing the exponents: 1e-34 /1e-45 =1e11.

6.626 /9.5565 ≈0.693.

So B ≈0.693e11 =6.93e10 s^-1.

Wait, sorry, units are s^-1. So the rotational energy difference is 2B. But E_rot = h B J (J+1). Wait, no, the energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), but B has units of energy per J(J+1). Or perhaps E_rot = ħ^2/(2I) * J (J+1). Because I think E_rot = (ħ² J (J+1)) / (2 I).

So, E_rot difference is E(1) - E(0) = ( ħ² (2) )/(2 I ) - 0 = ħ²/(I). Because for J=1, it's 2, J=0, it's 0.

Compute that. ħ is 1.05457e-34 J s. I is 1.2104e-46 kg m².

So ħ² / I = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (1.2104e-46) 

Calculate numerator: (1.05457)^2 ≈ 1.112, so 1.112e-68.

Divide by denominator: 1.2104e-46.

So ħ²/I ≈ 1.112e-68 / 1.2104e-46 ≈ approx 9.18e-23 J.

So the energy needed for the rotational transition is 9.18e-23 J. The vibrational transition is 4.218e-20 J. So the rotational transition requires less energy.

But the options don't match this. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. The question says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. Wait, maybe in this model, the next state could involve a change in both rotation and vibration. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the molecule can't change only rotation or only vibration. Oh, no, in the rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator approximation, the energy levels are separable. So the molecule can transition either vibrationally or rotationally.

But the question says to find the photon that allows the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the lowest energy increase would be the rotational one. So the photon must have that energy. Thus, the photon's energy is 9.18e-23 J, so p = E/c = 9.18e-23 / 3e8 = 3.06e-31 kg m/s.

But none of the options are that small. The options are:

A) 1.9e-28

B)2.3e-27

C)1.1e-27

D)1.4e-28

Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the first transition, but considering both rotational and vibrational. Or maybe the next state is the first excited state, which is a combination of rotation and vibration. But that's probably not the case.

Wait, maybe the question is considering a change in both rotation and vibration. For example, moving from v=0, J=0 to v=1, J=0. But that would require a photon with energy ħω. Alternatively, moving from v=0, J=0 to v=0, J=1, which would require a photon with energy 2B. Or perhaps the next state is the first excited state, which could be either one. But the question says "the next state with the lowest possible energy." So that would be the one with the smallest ΔE.

So, the photon's momentum is determined by the energy required for the transition. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, another possibility: The problem is considering the fundamental state as the state where both vibration and rotation are at their ground states. So the next state could be the next higher vibrational state, or a higher rotational state. The question is which requires the least energy.

Earlier calculations showed that the rotational transition requires E_rot =9.18e-23 J, which is about 1/40000 of the vibrational transition's energy. So the rotational transition is much lower.

But the options don't have this value. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Wait, let's compute B again. B is h/(8 pi² I).

h=6.626e-34 J s.

I=1.2104e-46 kg m².

So B=6.626e-34/(8 pi² * 1.2104e-46).

Compute denominator: 8 pi²≈78.9568. Multiply by I:78.9568 * 1.2104e-46 = 95.565e-46 =9.5565e-45.

So B=6.626e-34 /9.5565e-45 = approximately 6.626 /9.5565 ≈ 0.693 → 0.693e11 s^-1.

But wait, 6.626e-34 /9.5565e-45 → 6.626 /9.5565 = approx 0.693, and 1e-34 /1e-45 = 1e11. So 0.693e11 s^-1 → 6.93e10 s^-1.

Wait, but energy is E_rot = B J (J+1). So the transition from J=0 to J=1 would require 2B. But B is 6.93e10 s^-1. So 2B is 1.386e11 s^-1. To get energy, E = h * (angular frequency) → E= h * (1.386e11) = 6.626e-34 *1.386e11 ≈9.18e-23 J. Which is what I had earlier.

So the momentum p is E/c =9.18e-23 J /3e8 m/s =3.06e-31 kg m/s.

Looking at the options, that's not present. So perhaps the question is about the vibrational transition. Let's think again.

If the photon is absorbed to cause the molecule to transition to the next vibrational state (v=1), then the energy required is ħω.

ħ =1.05457e-34 J s.

ω=4e14 rad/s.

So E_photon=1.05457e-34 *4e14 =4.218e-20 J.

Then p = E/c =4.218e-20 /3e8 =1.406e-28 kg m/s.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28. That's close.

So why did I think earlier that the rotational transition is lower energy? Because 9.18e-23 J is way bigger than 4.2e-20 J. No, wait, no, 9e-23 is smaller than 4e-20. Because 4e-20 is 400 times larger than 9e-23.

Wait, no, wait: 9e-23 J is less than 4e-20 J. So the rotational transition requires less energy. So according to that, the photon needed is 9e-23 J, which gives p=3e-31 kg m/s, but that's not an option.

Hmm. So perhaps the problem is considering the transition from the fundamental state to the next state, which is the first excited state. The fundamental state is the lowest in both rotation and vibration. The next state could be the first excited state, which is either J=1 or v=1.

But the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me read again: "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy."

So the next state refers to the one with the smallest energy increment. So the photon that causes the transition should be the one with the smallest energy.

So the rotational transition requires less energy than the vibrational one. So that would be the correct transition. But the options don't match that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the molecule is in the "fundamental vibrational state" (v=0) but not necessarily J=0. Hmm, but the question says "fundamental state," which usually refers to the lowest vibrational and rotational states.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem implies that the molecule is in the ground vibrational state, but in the highest possible rotational state for that energy level. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because J=0 is the lowest.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-rigid rotor model doesn't allow transitions where only rotation changes, but that's not how it works. The model allows for separate transitions.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the vibrational transition, and the rotational transitions are ignored for some reason. But why?

Looking back at the question, it says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. So both are considered. But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the photon should provide the smallest possible energy to move to the next state.

So from the calculations, the rotational transition requires about 9e-23 J, which is much less than the vibrational transition's 4e-20 J. So the photon's momentum would be ≈3e-31 kg m/s. But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the change in rotation or vibration, but about electronic transitions. No, the question is about the rotation-vibration model, which is about rotational and vibrational energy levels, not electronic.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the energy levels.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the vibrational energy, but the given w is 4e14 rad/s. So E_vib = ħ w = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 ≈4.218e-20 J, which is correct.

But maybe the problem is referring to the Raman transition, which involves changing the rotational state without changing the vibrational state. But the question says "absorbed photon" which is an absorption, not Raman. So I think it's a vibrational or rotational transition.

Wait, perhaps when the molecule is in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0), the next state is the first excited vibrational state (v=1, J=0), but this requires a photon with energy ħw. Alternatively, the next state could be (v=0, J=1), requiring a photon with energy 2B. So which is smaller?

In this case, 2B is 9.18e-23 J, which is much less than 4.218e-20 J. So the photon for the rotational transition is needed.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the calculation was done incorrectly.

Wait, perhaps the moment of inertia is incorrect. Let me recompute I.

Mass X is 20 amu, mass Y is 2 amu. So μ = (20 *2)/(20+2) =40/22=20/11≈1.818 amu.

Convert μ to kg: 1 amu=1.66053906660e-27 kg. So μ=1.818 *1.660539e-27 ≈ approx 3.023e-27 kg.

Bond length r=2 angstroms=2e-10 m.

I= μ r² =3.023e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 =3.023e-27 *4e-20 =1.209e-46 kg m².

So previous calculation was correct.

Now, B= h/(8 pi^2 I). Let's compute that again.

h=6.62607015e-34 J s.

I=1.209e-46 kg m².

So B=6.62607e-34 / (8 * pi^2 *1.209e-46 )

8 * pi^2 ≈78.9568.

Denominator:78.9568 *1.209e-46 ≈95.4e-46 →9.54e-45.

So B=6.62607e-34 /9.54e-45.

Compute 6.62607e-34 /9.54e-45 = (6.62607/9.54) *1e11. 6.626/9.54≈0.694.

So B≈0.694e11 s^-1 →6.94e10 s^-1.

So 2B is 1.388e11 s^-1. The energy is h *2B =6.626e-34 *1.388e11 ≈9.18e-23 J.

So this part is correct. So p= E/c=9.18e-23 /3e8=3.06e-31 kg m/s.

But the options are way larger. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the next state with the lowest energy, but the next state in the energy ladder. That is, the next available state. For example, in the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are E_J = B J (J+1). So the energy levels are at 0, 2B, 6B, 12B, etc. But in the vibration-rotation model, each vibrational level has rotational sublevels. So the energy levels are E_vib + E_rot.

So the fundamental state is v=0, J=0. The next state would be v=0, J=1 (energy 2B), and then v=1, J=0 (energy ħw +0 +0?), perhaps. Or perhaps the next state is the first state with higher energy, regardless of whether it's vibration or rotation.

Wait, the energy levels are arranged as follows:

v=0, J=0 → E=0.

v=0, J=1 → E=2B.

v=0, J=2 → E=6B.

v=1, J=0 → E= ħw.

v=1, J=1 → E= ħw + 2B.

v=1, J=2 → E= ħw +6B.

So the next state after E=0 is E=2B (v=0, J=1), or E= ħw (v=1, J=0). Which is smaller? The 2B is about 9e-23 J, which is smaller than ħw, which is about 4.2e-20 J. So the next state is E=2B.

But again, the options don't match that. So perhaps the problem is considering the transition from v=0, J=0 to v=1, J=0, which requires a photon of energy ħw, so p=E/c=4.2e-20 /3e8=1.4e-28 kg m/s, which matches option D.

But why is that the case? Because perhaps in the non-rigid rotor model, the rotational states are not considered as being able to change when the vibrational state changes, or maybe the question is considering the vibrational transition, assuming that the rotational state remains the same.

Alternatively, perhaps the question considers that the molecule is in the ground state of vibration and rotation (v=0, J=0), and the next state is the next possible state in the energy order, which is v=0, J=1, but another possibility is v=1, J=0. The energy of v=0, J=1 is 2B, which is 9e-23 J. The energy of v=1, J=0 is ħw=4.2e-20 J. Since 9e-23 is less than 4.2e-20, the next state is v=0, J=1. But the photon required is 9e-23 J, which gives p=3e-31 kg m/s, not in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the molecule is in the fundamental rotational state but not the vibrational. No, the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, which implies both.

But maybe the question is considering that the molecule is in the ground rotational state (J=0), and the next state would be the first vibrational state (v=1). Then, the photon energy is ħw, which is 4.2e-20 J → p=1.4e-28 kg m/s → option D.

But why would it ignore the lower energy rotational transition? That must be the confusion here.

Wait, perhaps the question is phrased such that the molecule is in its fundamental vibrational state (v=0), but the rotational state is in the ground state, but the next state refers to the next vibrational state. But that would require a higher energy, which doesn't make sense for the "lowest possible energy" transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the molecule is in the ground state of the vibration-rotation spectrum, which is the state with v=0, J=0, and the next state is the first excited state, which is v=1, J=0. But then, the energy required is ħw.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the molecule is in the rigid rotor model, and the next rotational state is the only possible transition, but that's not the case.

But given the options, the only possible match is option D, 1.4e-28 kg m/s, which corresponds to the vibrational transition. So perhaps the intended answer is D.

But why would the question not consider the rotational transition? Maybe because it's a diatomic molecule, and the rotational transitions are forbidden or not allowed. But in reality, rotational transitions are dipole allowed when the change in dipole moment occurs, but for homonuclear diatomics, rotational transitions are forbidden. But the question says elements X and Y, so it's a heteronuclear diatomic, so rotational transitions are allowed. So the confusion remains.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the molecule is in the ground state of the vibration-rotation spectrum, which is v=0, J=0, and the next state is the first state with higher energy, which is v=1, J=0. But this would require a photon with energy ħw.

So perhaps the intended answer is D) 1.4e-28. So I think the correct answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the momentum of the photon required for the diatomic molecule to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy differences for both rotational and vibrational transitions.

     \mu = \frac{M_x \cdot M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{22} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}
     \]  
     Converting to kg:  
     \[
     \mu \approx 1.818 \cdot 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.023 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
     \]

2. **Bond Length**:  
   \( r = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)  
   Moment of inertia:  
   \[
   I = \mu r^2 = 3.023 \times 10^{-27} \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 \approx 1.210 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2
   \]

3. **Rotational Constant**:  
   \[
   B = \frac{h}{8 \pi^2 I}
   \]  
   Substituting \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J} \cdot \text{s} \) and \( I \):  
   \[
   B \approx \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{8 \pi^2 \cdot 1.210 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 6.93 \times 10^{10} \, \text{s}^{-1}
   \]  
   The energy difference for the rotational transition from \( J = 0 \) to \( J = 1 \) is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B = 2 \cdot 6.93 \times 10^{10} \approx 1.386 \times 10^{11} \, \text{s}^{-1}
   \]  
   Converting to energy:  
   \[
   E_{\text{rot}} = h \cdot \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \cdot 1.386 \times 10^{11} \approx 9.18 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
   \]

4. **Vibrational Transition**:  
   The vibrational energy difference is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = \hbar \omega = (1.05457 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) \approx 4.22 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}
   \]

### Analysis:
- The rotational transition requires \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} \approx 9.18 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), while the vibrational transition requires \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} \approx 4.22 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J} \).  
- The rotational transition requires significantly less energy. However, none of the provided options match the momentum corresponding to \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} \), which is:  
  \[
  p_{\text{rot}} = \frac{E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.18 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.06 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s}
  \]  
- The vibrational transition corresponds to:  
  \[
  p_{\text{vib}} = \frac{E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{4.22 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.41 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s}
  \]  
  This matches **Option D**.

### Conclusion:
The problem likely assumes the transition to the next vibrational state (\( v = 1, J = 0 \)) is being considered, as the rotational transition's momentum is not among the options. Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule transitioning between energy states. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state. Wait, what's the fundamental state? Oh right, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. So it's the ground state for both rotation and vibration.

The question asks what momentum a photon should have so that the molecule switches to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the molecule is absorbing a photon, which means it's going to a higher energy state. But what's the next lowest state after the fundamental?

I remember that in molecular vibrations, the energy levels are quantized. The vibrational energy levels are given by E_vib = (v + 1/2) ħω, where v is the vibrational quantum number. For the ground state, v is 0. So the next state would be v=1, so that's an increase in energy by one vibrational quantum.

Wait, but also, the molecule can change its rotational state. Oh right, because in the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy is E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. But since this is the non-rigid rotor, maybe it's more complex. But I'm not sure how that affects the answer here.

Wait, the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So which transition would give that? The lowest energy increase would be a change in either rotation or vibration by the smallest amount. Since each quantum in vibration is ħω, and each rotational quantum is proportional to J(J+1), but for the smallest change, probably a vibrational transition would be higher because ω is given as 4e14 rad/s, which is a high frequency (like in infrared maybe). Wait, but the photon's energy is determined by the energy difference. Let's think.

Wait, but the problem says the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy. So switching to the next state. But the molecule could either go to the next vibrational state (v=1) or a higher rotational state (J increases by 1). Which one requires a lower energy photon?

Wait, in the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is h/(8π² c I), and I is the moment of inertia. I think for HCl or similar, the rotational energy levels are very close together. But for a vibrational transition, each step is ħω, which is a much larger energy jump. So, if the molecule is in the ground vibrational state, the next state is v=1, which requires a photon with energy ħω.

But the question says the molecule can switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So that would be the next possible state that's just above the current one, which is either the next rotational state or the first vibrational state.

Wait, but the molecule is in the fundamental state, so v=0, J=0? Or J can be zero but v=0. So the next state could be either J=1 or v=1.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the energy levels. The total energy is the sum of rotational and vibrational energies. The fundamental state is the lowest, which is v=0 and J=0. The next possible state could be either J=1 (with same v=0) or v=1 (with same J=0). Which transition requires less energy?

The energy difference for the rotational transition from J=0 to J=1 would be E_rot(J=1) - E_rot(J=0) = B [1(2) - 0(1)] = 2B. The energy difference for the vibrational transition from v=0 to v=1 is ħω. So which is smaller, 2B or ħω?

Hmm, I need to compute B. B is h/(8π² I), where I is the moment of inertia. I is μ r², μ being the reduced mass, r the bond length.

The given data: Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu. So the reduced mass μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (20*2)/(22) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu. To convert that to kg: 1 amu is about 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ ≈ 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.023e-27 kg.

Wait, wait, Mx is 20 amu, My is 2. So 20 * 2 =40, 20+2=22. So 40/22=20/11 ≈1.818 amu. So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ let's calculate that. 1.818 *1.6605 is roughly 3.026. So μ ≈ 3.026e-27 kg.

The bond length r is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so r=2e-10 m.

Moment of inertia I = μ r². So I = 3.026e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.026e-27 *4e-20 = 12.104e-47 kg m² = 1.2104e-46 kg m².

Then B = h/(8 π² I). Let's compute that.

h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626e-34 J s.

So B = 6.626e-34 / (8 * (pi)^2 * 1.2104e-46).

Compute denominator: 8 * pi² ≈ 8 * 9.8696 ≈ 78.9568.

Multiply by I: 78.9568 *1.2104e-46 ≈ 95.77e-46 = 9.577e-45.

So B ≈ 6.626e-34 / 9.577e-45 ≈ (6.626/9.577) * 1e11 ≈ 0.691 * 1e11 ≈ 6.91e10 s^-2.

Wait, wait, B is in cm^-1 sometimes, but in terms of energy units, 1 s^-2. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake here. Rotational energy is E_rot = B J (J+1), but B is in terms of energy per J(J+1). Wait, maybe I should compute the energy difference ΔE_rot = E(1) - E(0) = B*(2-0) = 2B.

But wait, what's the value of B in terms of energy? Because E_rot is given by (B h c) J (J+1), but maybe I confused the constants. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 2B in terms of Joules.

Wait, I think B is h/(8 π² I c), but wait, no, that's if we're using B in cm^-1. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy difference.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute B correctly. The rotational constant B is given by B = h / (8 π² I), which gives units of J s. Because I is in kg m², h is J s. So B has units of 1/(s), so B is in s^-1.

Wait, no. Let me compute B again:

h = 6.626e-34 J s.

I = 1.2104e-46 kg m².

So B = h/(8 π² I) = (6.626e-34) / (8*(pi)^2 * 1.2104e-46).

Calculating denominator: 8 * pi^2 ≈ 78.9568. 78.9568 * 1.2104e-46 ≈ 78.9568 *1.2104 = let's see, 78.9568 *1.2 is about 94.748, and .0104*78.9568 ~ 0.817, so total ≈95.565. So 95.565e-46 = 9.5565e-45.

So B = 6.626e-34 / 9.5565e-45 ≈ (6.626 /9.5565) * 1e11 ≈ 0.693 * 1e11 ≈ 6.93e10 s^-1.

Wait, so B is about 6.93e10 per second. Then ΔE_rot = 2B = 2 *6.93e10 = 1.386e11 s^-1.

Energy difference is ΔE = ħ * ΔE_rot (since E = ħ ω), but wait, no. Wait, the rotational energy is quantized as E_rot = B J (J+1) * ħ? Or is B already in terms of energy per J(J+1)?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me recheck the formula.

The correct formula for rotational energy levels is E_rot = (ħ² / (2I)) * J (J+1), where I is the moment of inertia. So B in this context is ħ²/(2I), which would be the energy per J(J+1). So the energy difference between J and J+1 is (B) (2J+1).

Wait, so for the transition from J=0 to J=1, ΔE_rot = E(1) - E(0) = B [1*(2) - 0*(1)] = 2B.

But B is ħ²/(2I). So let's compute B.

B = ħ²/(2I). ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J s.

I is 1.2104e-46 kg m².

So B = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.2104e-46).

Calculate numerator: (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68.

Denominator: 2 *1.2104e-46 ≈2.4208e-46.

So B ≈ 1.112e-68 / 2.4208e-46 ≈ approx 4.59e-23 J.

So ΔE_rot = 2 * 4.59e-23 J ≈9.18e-23 J.

Wait, but the vibrational energy difference is ħω. Let's compute that. ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J s. ω is 4e14 rad/s.

So ΔE_vib = ħω = 1.0545718e-34 *4e14 ≈4.218e-20 J.

Comparing the two: ΔE_rot is about 9.18e-23 J, and ΔE_vib is ~4.2e-20 J. So the rotational transition requires much less energy. So the next lowest state would be the rotational transition, not the vibrational one.

But wait, the problem says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the smallest possible energy increase is the rotational transition. So the photon would need to have energy equal to that ΔE_rot, which is 9.18e-23 J. But wait, the question is about momentum, not energy. So photon energy is E_photon = pc, since for photons, E = pc. So p = E_photon / c.

So E_photon = 9.18e-23 J. c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So p = 9.18e-23 / 3e8 = 3.06e-31 kg m/s. Wait, but none of the options are that small. The options are in the 1e-27 or 1e-28 range. Hmmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again. The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. So for a diatomic molecule, the fundamental state is v=0, J=0. So the next state could be either J=1 (same v=0) or v=1, J=0. We need to find which transition requires the least energy.

But according to the calculations, the rotational transition requires about 9e-23 J, and the vibrational requires 4.2e-20 J. So the rotational is lower. So the photon's energy should be 9e-23 J. Thus, momentum p = E/c = 9e-23 /3e8 =3e-31 kg m/s. But looking at the options, that's not present.

Wait, the options are in the 1e-27 order. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, maybe I confused the units. Let's recalculate B again.

Wait, B is h/(8 π² I) where I is in kg m².

h = 6.626e-34 J s. I is 1.2104e-46 kg m².

So B = 6.626e-34 / (8 * (pi^2) *1.2104e-46)

Compute denominator: 8 * pi² ≈78.9568.

Multiply by I: 78.9568 *1.2104e-46 ≈ 95.565e-46 = 9.5565e-45.

So B ≈ 6.626e-34 / 9.5565e-45 ≈6.626e-34 /9.5565e-45.

Dividing the exponents: 1e-34 /1e-45 =1e11.

6.626 /9.5565 ≈0.693.

So B ≈0.693e11 =6.93e10 s^-1.

Wait, sorry, units are s^-1. So the rotational energy difference is 2B. But E_rot = h B J (J+1). Wait, no, the energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), but B has units of energy per J(J+1). Or perhaps E_rot = ħ^2/(2I) * J (J+1). Because I think E_rot = (ħ² J (J+1)) / (2 I).

So, E_rot difference is E(1) - E(0) = ( ħ² (2) )/(2 I ) - 0 = ħ²/(I). Because for J=1, it's 2, J=0, it's 0.

Compute that. ħ is 1.05457e-34 J s. I is 1.2104e-46 kg m².

So ħ² / I = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (1.2104e-46) 

Calculate numerator: (1.05457)^2 ≈ 1.112, so 1.112e-68.

Divide by denominator: 1.2104e-46.

So ħ²/I ≈ 1.112e-68 / 1.2104e-46 ≈ approx 9.18e-23 J.

So the energy needed for the rotational transition is 9.18e-23 J. The vibrational transition is 4.218e-20 J. So the rotational transition requires less energy.

But the options don't match this. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. The question says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. Wait, maybe in this model, the next state could involve a change in both rotation and vibration. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the molecule can't change only rotation or only vibration. Oh, no, in the rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator approximation, the energy levels are separable. So the molecule can transition either vibrationally or rotationally.

But the question says to find the photon that allows the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the lowest energy increase would be the rotational one. So the photon must have that energy. Thus, the photon's energy is 9.18e-23 J, so p = E/c = 9.18e-23 / 3e8 = 3.06e-31 kg m/s.

But none of the options are that small. The options are:

A) 1.9e-28

B)2.3e-27

C)1.1e-27

D)1.4e-28

Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the first transition, but considering both rotational and vibrational. Or maybe the next state is the first excited state, which is a combination of rotation and vibration. But that's probably not the case.

Wait, maybe the question is considering a change in both rotation and vibration. For example, moving from v=0, J=0 to v=1, J=0. But that would require a photon with energy ħω. Alternatively, moving from v=0, J=0 to v=0, J=1, which would require a photon with energy 2B. Or perhaps the next state is the first excited state, which could be either one. But the question says "the next state with the lowest possible energy." So that would be the one with the smallest ΔE.

So, the photon's momentum is determined by the energy required for the transition. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, another possibility: The problem is considering the fundamental state as the state where both vibration and rotation are at their ground states. So the next state could be the next higher vibrational state, or a higher rotational state. The question is which requires the least energy.

Earlier calculations showed that the rotational transition requires E_rot =9.18e-23 J, which is about 1/40000 of the vibrational transition's energy. So the rotational transition is much lower.

But the options don't have this value. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Wait, let's compute B again. B is h/(8 pi² I).

h=6.626e-34 J s.

I=1.2104e-46 kg m².

So B=6.626e-34/(8 pi² * 1.2104e-46).

Compute denominator: 8 pi²≈78.9568. Multiply by I:78.9568 * 1.2104e-46 = 95.565e-46 =9.5565e-45.

So B=6.626e-34 /9.5565e-45 = approximately 6.626 /9.5565 ≈ 0.693 → 0.693e11 s^-1.

But wait, 6.626e-34 /9.5565e-45 → 6.626 /9.5565 = approx 0.693, and 1e-34 /1e-45 = 1e11. So 0.693e11 s^-1 → 6.93e10 s^-1.

Wait, but energy is E_rot = B J (J+1). So the transition from J=0 to J=1 would require 2B. But B is 6.93e10 s^-1. So 2B is 1.386e11 s^-1. To get energy, E = h * (angular frequency) → E= h * (1.386e11) = 6.626e-34 *1.386e11 ≈9.18e-23 J. Which is what I had earlier.

So the momentum p is E/c =9.18e-23 J /3e8 m/s =3.06e-31 kg m/s.

Looking at the options, that's not present. So perhaps the question is about the vibrational transition. Let's think again.

If the photon is absorbed to cause the molecule to transition to the next vibrational state (v=1), then the energy required is ħω.

ħ =1.05457e-34 J s.

ω=4e14 rad/s.

So E_photon=1.05457e-34 *4e14 =4.218e-20 J.

Then p = E/c =4.218e-20 /3e8 =1.406e-28 kg m/s.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28. That's close.

So why did I think earlier that the rotational transition is lower energy? Because 9.18e-23 J is way bigger than 4.2e-20 J. No, wait, no, 9e-23 is smaller than 4e-20. Because 4e-20 is 400 times larger than 9e-23.

Wait, no, wait: 9e-23 J is less than 4e-20 J. So the rotational transition requires less energy. So according to that, the photon needed is 9e-23 J, which gives p=3e-31 kg m/s, but that's not an option.

Hmm. So perhaps the problem is considering the transition from the fundamental state to the next state, which is the first excited state. The fundamental state is the lowest in both rotation and vibration. The next state could be the first excited state, which is either J=1 or v=1.

But the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me read again: "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy."

So the next state refers to the one with the smallest energy increment. So the photon that causes the transition should be the one with the smallest energy.

So the rotational transition requires less energy than the vibrational one. So that would be the correct transition. But the options don't match that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the molecule is in the "fundamental vibrational state" (v=0) but not necessarily J=0. Hmm, but the question says "fundamental state," which usually refers to the lowest vibrational and rotational states.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem implies that the molecule is in the ground vibrational state, but in the highest possible rotational state for that energy level. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because J=0 is the lowest.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-rigid rotor model doesn't allow transitions where only rotation changes, but that's not how it works. The model allows for separate transitions.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the vibrational transition, and the rotational transitions are ignored for some reason. But why?

Looking back at the question, it says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. So both are considered. But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the photon should provide the smallest possible energy to move to the next state.

So from the calculations, the rotational transition requires about 9e-23 J, which is much less than the vibrational transition's 4e-20 J. So the photon's momentum would be ≈3e-31 kg m/s. But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the change in rotation or vibration, but about electronic transitions. No, the question is about the rotation-vibration model, which is about rotational and vibrational energy levels, not electronic.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the energy levels.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the vibrational energy, but the given w is 4e14 rad/s. So E_vib = ħ w = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 ≈4.218e-20 J, which is correct.

But maybe the problem is referring to the Raman transition, which involves changing the rotational state without changing the vibrational state. But the question says "absorbed photon" which is an absorption, not Raman. So I think it's a vibrational or rotational transition.

Wait, perhaps when the molecule is in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0), the next state is the first excited vibrational state (v=1, J=0), but this requires a photon with energy ħw. Alternatively, the next state could be (v=0, J=1), requiring a photon with energy 2B. So which is smaller?

In this case, 2B is 9.18e-23 J, which is much less than 4.218e-20 J. So the photon for the rotational transition is needed.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the calculation was done incorrectly.

Wait, perhaps the moment of inertia is incorrect. Let me recompute I.

Mass X is 20 amu, mass Y is 2 amu. So μ = (20 *2)/(20+2) =40/22=20/11≈1.818 amu.

Convert μ to kg: 1 amu=1.66053906660e-27 kg. So μ=1.818 *1.660539e-27 ≈ approx 3.023e-27 kg.

Bond length r=2 angstroms=2e-10 m.

I= μ r² =3.023e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 =3.023e-27 *4e-20 =1.209e-46 kg m².

So previous calculation was correct.

Now, B= h/(8 pi^2 I). Let's compute that again.

h=6.62607015e-34 J s.

I=1.209e-46 kg m².

So B=6.62607e-34 / (8 * pi^2 *1.209e-46 )

8 * pi^2 ≈78.9568.

Denominator:78.9568 *1.209e-46 ≈95.4e-46 →9.54e-45.

So B=6.62607e-34 /9.54e-45.

Compute 6.62607e-34 /9.54e-45 = (6.62607/9.54) *1e11. 6.626/9.54≈0.694.

So B≈0.694e11 s^-1 →6.94e10 s^-1.

So 2B is 1.388e11 s^-1. The energy is h *2B =6.626e-34 *1.388e11 ≈9.18e-23 J.

So this part is correct. So p= E/c=9.18e-23 /3e8=3.06e-31 kg m/s.

But the options are way larger. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the next state with the lowest energy, but the next state in the energy ladder. That is, the next available state. For example, in the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are E_J = B J (J+1). So the energy levels are at 0, 2B, 6B, 12B, etc. But in the vibration-rotation model, each vibrational level has rotational sublevels. So the energy levels are E_vib + E_rot.

So the fundamental state is v=0, J=0. The next state would be v=0, J=1 (energy 2B), and then v=1, J=0 (energy ħw +0 +0?), perhaps. Or perhaps the next state is the first state with higher energy, regardless of whether it's vibration or rotation.

Wait, the energy levels are arranged as follows:

v=0, J=0 → E=0.

v=0, J=1 → E=2B.

v=0, J=2 → E=6B.

v=1, J=0 → E= ħw.

v=1, J=1 → E= ħw + 2B.

v=1, J=2 → E= ħw +6B.

So the next state after E=0 is E=2B (v=0, J=1), or E= ħw (v=1, J=0). Which is smaller? The 2B is about 9e-23 J, which is smaller than ħw, which is about 4.2e-20 J. So the next state is E=2B.

But again, the options don't match that. So perhaps the problem is considering the transition from v=0, J=0 to v=1, J=0, which requires a photon of energy ħw, so p=E/c=4.2e-20 /3e8=1.4e-28 kg m/s, which matches option D.

But why is that the case? Because perhaps in the non-rigid rotor model, the rotational states are not considered as being able to change when the vibrational state changes, or maybe the question is considering the vibrational transition, assuming that the rotational state remains the same.

Alternatively, perhaps the question considers that the molecule is in the ground state of vibration and rotation (v=0, J=0), and the next state is the next possible state in the energy order, which is v=0, J=1, but another possibility is v=1, J=0. The energy of v=0, J=1 is 2B, which is 9e-23 J. The energy of v=1, J=0 is ħw=4.2e-20 J. Since 9e-23 is less than 4.2e-20, the next state is v=0, J=1. But the photon required is 9e-23 J, which gives p=3e-31 kg m/s, not in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the molecule is in the fundamental rotational state but not the vibrational. No, the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, which implies both.

But maybe the question is considering that the molecule is in the ground rotational state (J=0), and the next state would be the first vibrational state (v=1). Then, the photon energy is ħw, which is 4.2e-20 J → p=1.4e-28 kg m/s → option D.

But why would it ignore the lower energy rotational transition? That must be the confusion here.

Wait, perhaps the question is phrased such that the molecule is in its fundamental vibrational state (v=0), but the rotational state is in the ground state, but the next state refers to the next vibrational state. But that would require a higher energy, which doesn't make sense for the "lowest possible energy" transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the molecule is in the ground state of the vibration-rotation spectrum, which is the state with v=0, J=0, and the next state is the first excited state, which is v=1, J=0. But then, the energy required is ħw.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the molecule is in the rigid rotor model, and the next rotational state is the only possible transition, but that's not the case.

But given the options, the only possible match is option D, 1.4e-28 kg m/s, which corresponds to the vibrational transition. So perhaps the intended answer is D.

But why would the question not consider the rotational transition? Maybe because it's a diatomic molecule, and the rotational transitions are forbidden or not allowed. But in reality, rotational transitions are dipole allowed when the change in dipole moment occurs, but for homonuclear diatomics, rotational transitions are forbidden. But the question says elements X and Y, so it's a heteronuclear diatomic, so rotational transitions are allowed. So the confusion remains.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the molecule is in the ground state of the vibration-rotation spectrum, which is v=0, J=0, and the next state is the first state with higher energy, which is v=1, J=0. But this would require a photon with energy ħw.

So perhaps the intended answer is D) 1.4e-28. So I think the correct answer is D.


To determine the momentum of the photon required for the diatomic molecule to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy differences for both rotational and vibrational transitions.

### Key Information:
1. **Masses**:  
   - \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu} \), \( M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \)  
   - Reduced mass:  
     \[
     \mu = \frac{M_x \cdot M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{22} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}
     \]  
     Converting to kg:  
     \[
     \mu \approx 1.818 \cdot 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.023 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
     \]

2. **Bond Length**:  
   \( r = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)  
   Moment of inertia:  
   \[
   I = \mu r^2 = 3.023 \times 10^{-27} \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 \approx 1.210 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2
   \]

3. **Rotational Constant**:  
   \[
   B = \frac{h}{8 \pi^2 I}
   \]  
   Substituting \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J} \cdot \text{s} \) and \( I \):  
   \[
   B \approx \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{8 \pi^2 \cdot 1.210 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 6.93 \times 10^{10} \, \text{s}^{-1}
   \]  
   The energy difference for the rotational transition from \( J = 0 \) to \( J = 1 \) is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B = 2 \cdot 6.93 \times 10^{10} \approx 1.386 \times 10^{11} \, \text{s}^{-1}
   \]  
   Converting to energy:  
   \[
   E_{\text{rot}} = h \cdot \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \cdot 1.386 \times 10^{11} \approx 9.18 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
   \]

4. **Vibrational Transition**:  
   The vibrational energy difference is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = \hbar \omega = (1.05457 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) \approx 4.22 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}
   \]

### Analysis:
- The rotational transition requires \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} \approx 9.18 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), while the vibrational transition requires \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} \approx 4.22 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J} \).  
- The rotational transition requires significantly less energy. However, none of the provided options match the momentum corresponding to \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} \), which is:  
  \[
  p_{\text{rot}} = \frac{E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.18 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.06 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s}
  \]  
- The vibrational transition corresponds to:  
  \[
  p_{\text{vib}} = \frac{E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{4.22 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.41 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s}
  \]  
  This matches **Option D**.

### Conclusion:
The problem likely assumes the transition to the next vibrational state (\( v = 1, J = 0 \)) is being considered, as the rotational transition's momentum is not among the options. Thus, the correct answer is:
