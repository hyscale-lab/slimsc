Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. These |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the Pauli z-matrix. The question is asking for the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm. I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated using the formula ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where O is the operator and |ψ⟩ is the state. So for this problem, I'll need to compute the expectation value of each term (10σz and 5σx) separately and then add them together.

First, let me write down the state |ψ⟩. It is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Wait, let me check if this is normalized. The coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. Let's square them: (0.5)^2 is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4) = 0.75. Adding those gives 1, so yes, it's normalized. Good.

Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the expectation value of σz should be straightforward. The eigenvalues for σz are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩. So the expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

The probability of |↑⟩ is (0.5)^2 = 0.25, so that contributes 0.25 * 1 = 0.25. The probability of |↓⟩ is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4 = 0.75, contributing 0.75 * (-1) = -0.75. Adding them gives 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5.

Now, multiplying by 10, the expectation value of 10σz is 10 * (-0.5) = -5.

Next is σx. I'm a bit fuzzy on σx's properties. Oh right, σx is the Pauli x matrix. Its eigenstates are the |+x⟩ and |-x⟩ states, but in this problem, the state is expressed in the σz basis. So I can't directly use the same approach as σz. Instead, I need to compute ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩.

Let me recall that σx is represented as [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. So when acting on |↑⟩, σx|↑⟩ = |↓⟩, and σx|↓⟩ = |↑⟩.

Wait no, I think that's correct. Let me confirm: σz has eigenstates |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. σx is a Hermitian operator and its own eigenstates are |+x⟩ and |-x⟩, which are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. But for this problem, I might need to express σx in the σz basis.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value using the matrix representation. Let me proceed step by step.

The state |ψ⟩ can be written as a column vector. Let's write that out. |↑⟩ is usually [1; 0], and |↓⟩ is [0; 1]. So |ψ⟩ is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

The operator σx is a 2x2 matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. So to compute ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩, I can do the following:

First, write |ψ⟩ as a column vector: ψ = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

Then, σx|ψ⟩ would be [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T because σx swaps the components. Then, the expectation value is ψ† (σx |ψ⟩), which is the conjugate transpose of ψ multiplied by the vector σx|ψ⟩.

Wait, ψ is real, so the conjugate transpose is just the transpose. So ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

So the product ψ† (σx |ψ⟩) is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = 0.5*sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5.

Let me compute this: 0.5 * 0.866 (approx sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866) is approximately 0.433. So the first term is 0.433, the second term is the same, so 0.433 +0.433 = 0.866. But wait, let me compute exactly.

0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) is (sqrt(3)/4). Similarly, the second term is (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 = sqrt(3)/4. So adding them gives sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

Wait, no, wait a minute. Let me think again. The inner product is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] · [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]. Oh wait, no, because σx|ψ⟩ is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5], right? Because σx swaps the up and down components.

So the inner product would be (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5).

Let me compute that: 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(3)/4, approximately 0.433. The second term is the same, so total is 2*(sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866. So ⟨σx⟩ is approximately 0.866.

Wait, but wait: Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Another way to compute ⟨σx⟩ is to use the formula ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = |a|^2 (⟨↑|σx|↑⟩) + |b|^2 (⟨↓|σx|↓⟩) + a b* ⟨↑|σx|↓⟩ + a* b ⟨↓|σx|↑⟩.

Hmm, but σx is [[0 1], [1 0]]. So σx acting on |↑⟩ is |↓⟩, and σx acting on |↓⟩ is |↑⟩.

So:

⟨↑|σx|↑⟩ = 0, because ⟨↑| is [1 0], and σx |↑⟩ is |↓⟩, which is [0;1], so the inner product is 1*0 +0*1=0.

Similarly, ⟨↓|σx|↓⟩ is 0.

Then the cross terms: a b* ⟨↑|σx|↓⟩. Now, σx|↓⟩ = |↑⟩. So ⟨↑|σx|↓⟩ is ⟨↑|↑⟩ = 1.

Similarly, a* b ⟨↓|σx|↑⟩ is a* b ⟨↓|↓⟩ = a* b.

So putting it all together, ⟨σx⟩ = |a|^2 * 0 + |b|^2 *0 + a b* * 1 + a* b * 1.

Which simplifies to (a b* + a* b) = 2 Re(a b*).

So let's compute that. a is 0.5, b is sqrt(3)/2.

a b* = (0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/4 ≈ 0.433. The real part is the same, so 2 * (sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So yes, same result as before. So ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So the expectation value of 5σx is 5 * (sqrt(3)/2) ≈ 5 * 0.866 = 4.33.

Then, the total expectation value is the sum of the two parts: 10σz contributes -5, and 5σx contributes approximately 4.33.

Adding together: -5 +4.33 = -0.67 approximately.

Wait, but let me compute that precisely. Let me get exact expressions.

So,

⟨10σz +5σx⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩ = 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2).

Which is -5 + (5 * sqrt(3)) /2.

Compute 5*sqrt(3)/2. Sqrt(3)≈1.732. So 1.732 *5 =8.66. 8.66/2 =4.33.

So total is -5 +4.33 = -0.67.

Wait, but wait: Let me compute that more accurately. sqrt(3) is approximately 1.73205.

So 5 * sqrt(3) = 5 * 1.73205 = 8.66025.

Divided by 2: 4.330125.

So 4.330125 minus 5 is -0.669875.

Rounded to one decimal place, that's approximately -0.7.

Looking at the options, option C is -0.7. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me double-check all steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Another approach: calculate the matrix for σz and σx.

The state is ψ = [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

Compute 10σz +5σx. First, let's write the matrices.

σz = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]
σx = [[0,1], [1,0]]

So 10σz is [[10,0], [0,-10]]
5σx is [[0,5], [5,0]]
Adding them together gives:

[[10,5], [5,-15]]

So the combined operator is matrix M = [[10,5],[5,-15]].

Then, the expectation value is ψ† M ψ.

Compute ψ† M ψ: ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

So ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

Multiply M by ψ: Mψ = [10*0.5 +5*(sqrt(3)/2), 5*0.5 + (-15)*(sqrt(3)/2)].

Compute each component:

First component:
10*0.5 =5
5*(sqrt(3)/2) = (5 sqrt(3))/2 ≈ 4.3301
Total:5+4.3301=9.3301

Second component:
5*0.5 =2.5
-15 * (sqrt(3)/2) ≈ -15 *0.8660 ≈-12.990
Total: 2.5 -12.990 ≈-10.490

So Mψ is [9.3301; -10.490]

Now, ψ† Mψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] multiplied by [9.3301; -10.490].

So compute 0.5 *9.3301 + (sqrt(3)/2)*(-10.490).

Compute each term:

0.5 *9.3301≈4.66505.

(sqrt(3)/2) is about 0.8660. So 0.8660 * (-10.490) ≈ -9.087.

Adding together: 4.66505 -9.087 ≈-4.422.

Wait, wait, that's a different result than before. Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, perhaps I messed up a step.

Wait, wait, the operator is 10σz +5σx, which is M = [[10,5],[5,-15]].

So Mψ is [ (10*(0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2)), (5*(0.5) + (-15)*(sqrt(3)/2)) ) ].

Wait, let me recalculate Mψ.

First component:
10 * 0.5 =5
5 * (sqrt(3)/2) ≈5*(0.8660)=4.3301
Sum:5+4.3301=9.3301.

Second component:
5 *0.5 =2.5
-15*(sqrt(3)/2)= -15*(0.8660)= -12.990
Sum:2.5 -12.990= -10.49.

Now, ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

So the inner product is 0.5 *9.3301 + (sqrt(3)/2)* (-10.49).

Compute each term:

0.5 *9.3301 =4.66505.

(sqrt(3)/2) is 0.8660. So 0.8660 * (-10.49) = let's compute that.

10.49 *0.8660 ≈10.49 *0.8660.

Let me compute 10 *0.8660 is 8.66, 0.49 *0.8660 ≈0.42434. So total ≈8.66+0.42434=9.08434. So 10.49 *0.8660 ≈9.084. So 0.8660 * (-10.49) ≈-9.084.

So the inner product is 4.66505 -9.084≈-4.41895.

Wait, this is conflicting with the previous result of -0.67.

Hmm, that's a problem. There must be a mistake in my approach. Oh wait, I think I messed up the operator.

Wait, the operator is 10σz +5σx. So when I calculate the expectation value, I must compute ⟨ψ| (10σz +5σx) |ψ⟩.

But the way I did it with matrices, perhaps I made a mistake. Because the matrix approach should give the same result as the other method.

Wait, what's the correct expectation value? Earlier, I thought it was -0.67, but using the matrix method it's -4.41895. There must be a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in constructing the matrix for 10σz +5σx.

Wait, 10σz is [[10,0],[0,-10]], and 5σx is [[0,5],[5,0]]. Adding them together gives [[10,5],[5,-15]], which is correct.

Wait, let's compute the expectation value again. The state |ψ> is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

So, the expectation value is ψ† * M * ψ.

Compute Mψ first:

M ψ = [10*(0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2), 5*(0.5) + (-10)*(sqrt(3)/2)].

Wait, wait a minute, I think I made a mistake in the second component earlier. Because 10σz is [[10,0],[0,-10]], so when you add 5σx, which is [[0,5],[5,0]], the second diagonal element is -10 +0 = -10? No, no, wait. Oh wait, no.

Wait, 10σz is [[10,0],[0,-10]]

5σx is [[0,5],[5,0]]

So when you add them, each element is added:

Top left: 10 +0 =10

Top right:0+5=5

Bottom left:0+5=5

Bottom right: -10 +0= -10.

So M is correct as [[10,5],[5,-10]]. Wait, wait! Oh no, wait. Earlier I thought that the second diagonal element was -15, but that's incorrect. It's just -10.

Oh, I see the mistake! Earlier, when I added 10σz and 5σx, I thought the second diagonal element was -10 +5*(something?), but no. Let me recompute the matrix addition.

σz is [[1,0],[0,-1]], so 10σz is [[10,0],[0,-10]]

σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], so 5σx is [[0,5],[5,0]]

Adding these two matrices:

Top left:10+0=10

Top right:0+5=5

Bottom left:0+5=5

Bottom right:-10+0=-10.

So the correct M is [[10,5],[5,-10]].

Ah, that's where I messed up earlier! I thought the M matrix had -15 in the [2,2] position, but it's actually -10.

So, let me recalculate Mψ with the correct M.

Mψ = [10*(0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2), 5*(0.5) + (-10)*(sqrt(3)/2)]

Compute each component:

First component:
10 *0.5=5
5 * (sqrt(3)/2)= (5 *1.732)/2=8.66/2=4.33
Total:5+4.33=9.33.

Second component:
5*0.5=2.5
-10*(sqrt(3)/2)= -10*(1.732/2) = -10*0.866= -8.66
Sum:2.5 -8.66= -6.16.

So Mψ is [9.33, -6.16].

Now, the inner product ψ† Mψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] · [9.33, -6.16].

Compute each term:

0.5 *9.33 =4.665

sqrt(3)/2 * (-6.16) ≈0.866 * (-6.16)= approx -5.316.

Add them together:4.665 -5.316 ≈-0.651.

So the expectation value is approximately -0.65. Rounded to one decimal place, that's -0.7, which matches option C.

So I must have made a mistake in the matrix addition earlier, which led me to an incorrect result. But with the correct M matrix, the expectation value is approximately -0.65, which rounds to -0.7.

The problem involves calculating the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for a spin-half particle in the state \( |\psi\rangle = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are eigenstates of \( \sigma_z \). The expectation value is computed as \( \langle \psi | (10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x) | \psi \rangle \).

### Step 1: Expectation value of \( \sigma_z \)
The eigenvalues of \( \sigma_z \) are \( +1 \) for \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( -1 \) for \( |\downarrow\rangle \). The probabilities of the particle being in \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are \( |0.5|^2 = 0.25 \) and \( |\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|^2 = 0.75 \), respectively. Thus, the expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]
Multiplying by 10, the contribution from \( 10\sigma_z \) is:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z \rangle = 10 \times (-0.5) = -5.
\]

### Step 2: Expectation value of \( \sigma_x \)
The matrix representation of \( \sigma_x \) is:
\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
The state \( |\psi\rangle \) can be written as a column vector:
\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]
The operator \( \sigma_x \) swaps the components of \( |\psi\rangle \), so:
\[
\sigma_x |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
The expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is the inner product \( \langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle \):
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 & \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
Computing the terms:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = (0.5)(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}) + (\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})(0.5) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]
Approximating \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \), we find:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle \approx \frac{1.732}{2} \approx 0.866.
\]
Multiplying by 5, the contribution from \( 5\sigma_x \) is:
\[
\langle 5\sigma_x \rangle = 5 \times 0.866 \approx 4.33.
\]

### Step 3: Total expectation value
The total expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = \langle 10\sigma_z \rangle + \langle 5\sigma_x \rangle = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]
Rounding to one decimal place, the result is \( -0.7 \).

### Final Answer:
The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is approximately \( -0.7 \), which corresponds to option **C**.

Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. These |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the Pauli z-matrix. The question is asking for the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm. I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated using the formula ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where O is the operator and |ψ⟩ is the state. So for this problem, I'll need to compute the expectation value of each term (10σz and 5σx) separately and then add them together.

First, let me write down the state |ψ⟩. It is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Wait, let me check if this is normalized. The coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. Let's square them: (0.5)^2 is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4) = 0.75. Adding those gives 1, so yes, it's normalized. Good.

Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the expectation value of σz should be straightforward. The eigenvalues for σz are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩. So the expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

The probability of |↑⟩ is (0.5)^2 = 0.25, so that contributes 0.25 * 1 = 0.25. The probability of |↓⟩ is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4 = 0.75, contributing 0.75 * (-1) = -0.75. Adding them gives 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5.

Now, multiplying by 10, the expectation value of 10σz is 10 * (-0.5) = -5.

Next is σx. I'm a bit fuzzy on σx's properties. Oh right, σx is the Pauli x matrix. Its eigenstates are the |+x⟩ and |-x⟩ states, but in this problem, the state is expressed in the σz basis. So I can't directly use the same approach as σz. Instead, I need to compute ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩.

Let me recall that σx is represented as [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. So when acting on |↑⟩, σx|↑⟩ = |↓⟩, and σx|↓⟩ = |↑⟩.

Wait no, I think that's correct. Let me confirm: σz has eigenstates |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. σx is a Hermitian operator and its own eigenstates are |+x⟩ and |-x⟩, which are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. But for this problem, I might need to express σx in the σz basis.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value using the matrix representation. Let me proceed step by step.

The state |ψ⟩ can be written as a column vector. Let's write that out. |↑⟩ is usually [1; 0], and |↓⟩ is [0; 1]. So |ψ⟩ is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

The operator σx is a 2x2 matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. So to compute ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩, I can do the following:

First, write |ψ⟩ as a column vector: ψ = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

Then, σx|ψ⟩ would be [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T because σx swaps the components. Then, the expectation value is ψ† (σx |ψ⟩), which is the conjugate transpose of ψ multiplied by the vector σx|ψ⟩.

Wait, ψ is real, so the conjugate transpose is just the transpose. So ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

So the product ψ† (σx |ψ⟩) is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = 0.5*sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5.

Let me compute this: 0.5 * 0.866 (approx sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866) is approximately 0.433. So the first term is 0.433, the second term is the same, so 0.433 +0.433 = 0.866. But wait, let me compute exactly.

0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) is (sqrt(3)/4). Similarly, the second term is (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 = sqrt(3)/4. So adding them gives sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

Wait, no, wait a minute. Let me think again. The inner product is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] · [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]. Oh wait, no, because σx|ψ⟩ is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5], right? Because σx swaps the up and down components.

So the inner product would be (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5).

Let me compute that: 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(3)/4, approximately 0.433. The second term is the same, so total is 2*(sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866. So ⟨σx⟩ is approximately 0.866.

Wait, but wait: Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Another way to compute ⟨σx⟩ is to use the formula ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = |a|^2 (⟨↑|σx|↑⟩) + |b|^2 (⟨↓|σx|↓⟩) + a b* ⟨↑|σx|↓⟩ + a* b ⟨↓|σx|↑⟩.

Hmm, but σx is [[0 1], [1 0]]. So σx acting on |↑⟩ is |↓⟩, and σx acting on |↓⟩ is |↑⟩.

So:

⟨↑|σx|↑⟩ = 0, because ⟨↑| is [1 0], and σx |↑⟩ is |↓⟩, which is [0;1], so the inner product is 1*0 +0*1=0.

Similarly, ⟨↓|σx|↓⟩ is 0.

Then the cross terms: a b* ⟨↑|σx|↓⟩. Now, σx|↓⟩ = |↑⟩. So ⟨↑|σx|↓⟩ is ⟨↑|↑⟩ = 1.

Similarly, a* b ⟨↓|σx|↑⟩ is a* b ⟨↓|↓⟩ = a* b.

So putting it all together, ⟨σx⟩ = |a|^2 * 0 + |b|^2 *0 + a b* * 1 + a* b * 1.

Which simplifies to (a b* + a* b) = 2 Re(a b*).

So let's compute that. a is 0.5, b is sqrt(3)/2.

a b* = (0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/4 ≈ 0.433. The real part is the same, so 2 * (sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So yes, same result as before. So ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So the expectation value of 5σx is 5 * (sqrt(3)/2) ≈ 5 * 0.866 = 4.33.

Then, the total expectation value is the sum of the two parts: 10σz contributes -5, and 5σx contributes approximately 4.33.

Adding together: -5 +4.33 = -0.67 approximately.

Wait, but let me compute that precisely. Let me get exact expressions.

So,

⟨10σz +5σx⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩ = 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2).

Which is -5 + (5 * sqrt(3)) /2.

Compute 5*sqrt(3)/2. Sqrt(3)≈1.732. So 1.732 *5 =8.66. 8.66/2 =4.33.

So total is -5 +4.33 = -0.67.

Wait, but wait: Let me compute that more accurately. sqrt(3) is approximately 1.73205.

So 5 * sqrt(3) = 5 * 1.73205 = 8.66025.

Divided by 2: 4.330125.

So 4.330125 minus 5 is -0.669875.

Rounded to one decimal place, that's approximately -0.7.

Looking at the options, option C is -0.7. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me double-check all steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Another approach: calculate the matrix for σz and σx.

The state is ψ = [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

Compute 10σz +5σx. First, let's write the matrices.

σz = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]
σx = [[0,1], [1,0]]

So 10σz is [[10,0], [0,-10]]
5σx is [[0,5], [5,0]]
Adding them together gives:

[[10,5], [5,-15]]

So the combined operator is matrix M = [[10,5],[5,-15]].

Then, the expectation value is ψ† M ψ.

Compute ψ† M ψ: ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

So ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

Multiply M by ψ: Mψ = [10*0.5 +5*(sqrt(3)/2), 5*0.5 + (-15)*(sqrt(3)/2)].

Compute each component:

First component:
10*0.5 =5
5*(sqrt(3)/2) = (5 sqrt(3))/2 ≈ 4.3301
Total:5+4.3301=9.3301

Second component:
5*0.5 =2.5
-15 * (sqrt(3)/2) ≈ -15 *0.8660 ≈-12.990
Total: 2.5 -12.990 ≈-10.490

So Mψ is [9.3301; -10.490]

Now, ψ† Mψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] multiplied by [9.3301; -10.490].

So compute 0.5 *9.3301 + (sqrt(3)/2)*(-10.490).

Compute each term:

0.5 *9.3301≈4.66505.

(sqrt(3)/2) is about 0.8660. So 0.8660 * (-10.490) ≈ -9.087.

Adding together: 4.66505 -9.087 ≈-4.422.

Wait, wait, that's a different result than before. Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, perhaps I messed up a step.

Wait, wait, the operator is 10σz +5σx, which is M = [[10,5],[5,-15]].

So Mψ is [ (10*(0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2)), (5*(0.5) + (-15)*(sqrt(3)/2)) ) ].

Wait, let me recalculate Mψ.

First component:
10 * 0.5 =5
5 * (sqrt(3)/2) ≈5*(0.8660)=4.3301
Sum:5+4.3301=9.3301.

Second component:
5 *0.5 =2.5
-15*(sqrt(3)/2)= -15*(0.8660)= -12.990
Sum:2.5 -12.990= -10.49.

Now, ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

So the inner product is 0.5 *9.3301 + (sqrt(3)/2)* (-10.49).

Compute each term:

0.5 *9.3301 =4.66505.

(sqrt(3)/2) is 0.8660. So 0.8660 * (-10.49) = let's compute that.

10.49 *0.8660 ≈10.49 *0.8660.

Let me compute 10 *0.8660 is 8.66, 0.49 *0.8660 ≈0.42434. So total ≈8.66+0.42434=9.08434. So 10.49 *0.8660 ≈9.084. So 0.8660 * (-10.49) ≈-9.084.

So the inner product is 4.66505 -9.084≈-4.41895.

Wait, this is conflicting with the previous result of -0.67.

Hmm, that's a problem. There must be a mistake in my approach. Oh wait, I think I messed up the operator.

Wait, the operator is 10σz +5σx. So when I calculate the expectation value, I must compute ⟨ψ| (10σz +5σx) |ψ⟩.

But the way I did it with matrices, perhaps I made a mistake. Because the matrix approach should give the same result as the other method.

Wait, what's the correct expectation value? Earlier, I thought it was -0.67, but using the matrix method it's -4.41895. There must be a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in constructing the matrix for 10σz +5σx.

Wait, 10σz is [[10,0],[0,-10]], and 5σx is [[0,5],[5,0]]. Adding them together gives [[10,5],[5,-15]], which is correct.

Wait, let's compute the expectation value again. The state |ψ> is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

So, the expectation value is ψ† * M * ψ.

Compute Mψ first:

M ψ = [10*(0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2), 5*(0.5) + (-10)*(sqrt(3)/2)].

Wait, wait a minute, I think I made a mistake in the second component earlier. Because 10σz is [[10,0],[0,-10]], so when you add 5σx, which is [[0,5],[5,0]], the second diagonal element is -10 +0 = -10? No, no, wait. Oh wait, no.

Wait, 10σz is [[10,0],[0,-10]]

5σx is [[0,5],[5,0]]

So when you add them, each element is added:

Top left: 10 +0 =10

Top right:0+5=5

Bottom left:0+5=5

Bottom right: -10 +0= -10.

So M is correct as [[10,5],[5,-10]]. Wait, wait! Oh no, wait. Earlier I thought that the second diagonal element was -15, but that's incorrect. It's just -10.

Oh, I see the mistake! Earlier, when I added 10σz and 5σx, I thought the second diagonal element was -10 +5*(something?), but no. Let me recompute the matrix addition.

σz is [[1,0],[0,-1]], so 10σz is [[10,0],[0,-10]]

σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], so 5σx is [[0,5],[5,0]]

Adding these two matrices:

Top left:10+0=10

Top right:0+5=5

Bottom left:0+5=5

Bottom right:-10+0=-10.

So the correct M is [[10,5],[5,-10]].

Ah, that's where I messed up earlier! I thought the M matrix had -15 in the [2,2] position, but it's actually -10.

So, let me recalculate Mψ with the correct M.

Mψ = [10*(0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2), 5*(0.5) + (-10)*(sqrt(3)/2)]

Compute each component:

First component:
10 *0.5=5
5 * (sqrt(3)/2)= (5 *1.732)/2=8.66/2=4.33
Total:5+4.33=9.33.

Second component:
5*0.5=2.5
-10*(sqrt(3)/2)= -10*(1.732/2) = -10*0.866= -8.66
Sum:2.5 -8.66= -6.16.

So Mψ is [9.33, -6.16].

Now, the inner product ψ† Mψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] · [9.33, -6.16].

Compute each term:

0.5 *9.33 =4.665

sqrt(3)/2 * (-6.16) ≈0.866 * (-6.16)= approx -5.316.

Add them together:4.665 -5.316 ≈-0.651.

So the expectation value is approximately -0.65. Rounded to one decimal place, that's -0.7, which matches option C.

So I must have made a mistake in the matrix addition earlier, which led me to an incorrect result. But with the correct M matrix, the expectation value is approximately -0.65, which rounds to -0.7.


The problem involves calculating the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for a spin-half particle in the state \( |\psi\rangle = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are eigenstates of \( \sigma_z \). The expectation value is computed as \( \langle \psi | (10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x) | \psi \rangle \).

### Step 1: Expectation value of \( \sigma_z \)
The eigenvalues of \( \sigma_z \) are \( +1 \) for \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( -1 \) for \( |\downarrow\rangle \). The probabilities of the particle being in \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are \( |0.5|^2 = 0.25 \) and \( |\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|^2 = 0.75 \), respectively. Thus, the expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]
Multiplying by 10, the contribution from \( 10\sigma_z \) is:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z \rangle = 10 \times (-0.5) = -5.
\]

### Step 2: Expectation value of \( \sigma_x \)
The matrix representation of \( \sigma_x \) is:
\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
The state \( |\psi\rangle \) can be written as a column vector:
\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]
The operator \( \sigma_x \) swaps the components of \( |\psi\rangle \), so:
\[
\sigma_x |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
The expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is the inner product \( \langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle \):
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 & \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
Computing the terms:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = (0.5)(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}) + (\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})(0.5) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]
Approximating \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \), we find:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle \approx \frac{1.732}{2} \approx 0.866.
\]
Multiplying by 5, the contribution from \( 5\sigma_x \) is:
\[
\langle 5\sigma_x \rangle = 5 \times 0.866 \approx 4.33.
\]

### Step 3: Total expectation value
The total expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = \langle 10\sigma_z \rangle + \langle 5\sigma_x \rangle = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]
Rounding to one decimal place, the result is \( -0.7 \).

### Final Answer:
The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is approximately \( -0.7 \), which corresponds to option **C**.
