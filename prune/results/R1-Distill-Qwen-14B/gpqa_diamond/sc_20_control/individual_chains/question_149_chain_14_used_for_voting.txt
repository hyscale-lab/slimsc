Okay, so I've got this question about a peptidic compound and its NMR and LC-MS analysis. Hmm, let me try to think this through step by step.

Alright, the question says that the 1H NMR spectrum is mostly as expected, except for two peaks that correspond to the same alpha-proton. Both peaks have similar shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. So, the integration suggests each is about 0.5 H? And they’re the same alpha proton, so why two peaks?

The coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. Wait, why? Because if it was coupling to another proton, like a neighboring proton, you'd see a splitting. But since it's ruled out, maybe it's not about coupling but something else causing the peak to split. Hmm.

Then, the LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature shows two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass spectrum as expected. So, the same molecular weight, right? But they're two separate peaks, meaning two different compounds? Or maybe the same compound in different forms.

Looking at the options:

A) Contaminated with a precursor. If it's a precursor, the mass would be different, I think. Because the precursor would have a lower mass, like missing a part that's been cleaved off. But the question says both peaks have the same mass as the expected molecule. So probably not A.

B) Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images, non-superimposable. They'd have the same molecular weight, so same mass spec. But in NMR, enantiomers are identical in terms of peaks because the NMR can't distinguish them (since it's based on the local environment, which is same for enantiomers). Wait, no, actually, in racemic mixtures, the NMR would show the same as a pure sample because the peaks overlap. So if it's a racemic mixture, the NMR would look normal, right? But the question says there are two peaks for the same alpha proton. So maybe B isn't the answer.

C) Double coupling during amide bond formation. I'm not exactly sure what that means. Double coupling might refer to some kind of coupling during the reaction that causes more splitting. But the question says they ruled out spin-spin coupling, so I'm not sure. Maybe it's something else, like if the amide bond formed in two different ways, leading to different structures. Hmm.

D) Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so they would have different NMR spectra. So that could explain the two peaks in the NMR. Also, diastereomers would have the same molecular weight, so same mass in LC-MS. But wait, in the NMR, if you have two diastereomers, each would have their own set of protons. But the question says the two peaks for the same alpha proton. So perhaps each diastereomer has an alpha proton that is equivalent in each structure but split into two due to different environments. Wait, not sure.

Wait, in the NMR, if it's a diastereomeric mixture, each diastereomer would have peaks for the same proton but perhaps in different shifts. So, the same alpha proton in diastereomers could have different environments, leading to different shifts. But in this case, the two peaks have similar shifts, same integration. Hmm. So maybe the environment isn't that different, but maybe the molecule is in different tautomeric states or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the issue is with the synthesis—like if the reaction didn't go to completion and you have some starting material or something. But option A says precursor, but the mass would be different, so probably not.

Wait, back to the NMR. The two peaks integrate to 1H. So perhaps each is 0.5 H. But why two peaks for the same proton? If the environment is different, maybe that's because of some kind of splitting. But the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin, so it's not about coupling with another proton.

Wait, another possibility: is it a result of the molecule being in different conformations? Like, if the alpha proton is in two different conformers that are exchanging on the NMR timescale. But then, the peaks would be broad or as a singlet, maybe. Not sure.

Wait, the question says the two peaks are for the same alpha-proton. So in the structure, the alpha proton is the same. But in the NMR, why two peaks? So perhaps in the actual compound, the alpha position is in two different environments for each molecule.

Wait, maybe it's due to dynamic processes. For example, if the molecule is undergoing some kind of ring-opening or closing, like a cyclic structure that can open and close. If the exchange between conformations is slow on the NMR timescale, you might see two peaks. But then, why are the shifts similar? Or perhaps the two peaks are from different isomers, like diastereomers.

Wait, if the compound is a diastereomer mixture, each would have their own set of peaks. So the same alpha protons would be in different environments, hence different shifts. But the question says their shifts are similar. So maybe diastereomers are not the case.

Alternatively, the two peaks are due to the presence of two different diastereomers that have the same alpha proton environment, leading to the same shift. That seems unlikely, but perhaps...

Wait, another thought: maybe it's a result of an elimination or addition during synthesis. Like, if the amide bond is formed in two different ways, leading to different stereoisomers.

Wait, looking at option C: 'double coupling' during the amide bond forming reaction. I'm not entirely sure what that means. Maybe it's a side reaction where the same amide bond forms in two different ways, leading to two products. But I'm not familiar with 'double coupling' in this context.

Alternatively, maybe it's a case of tautomerism. But then, the shifts would probably be more different.

Wait, the LC-MS shows two peaks with the same mass. So the same molecular weight, but perhaps different structures. Or maybe the same structure but different charge states or something else. But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, if the compound exists as two different diastereomers, they would have the same molecular weight but different physical properties. So in LC-MS, they would elute at different times but same mass, which matches the observation. But in NMR, each diastereomer would have its own set of peaks. But the question says that only the alpha proton shows two peaks, others are normal. So that suggests that the other protons are not split, only the alpha.

Hmm, maybe the alpha proton is in a chiral environment, and the diastereomers cause that proton to split into two peaks. But I thought diastereomers would have different environments, so the shift would be different, but the question says the shifts are similar.

Alternatively, perhaps the alpha proton is in a situation where there's some kind of coupling that isn't spin-spin. But the question says coupling can be ruled out.

Wait, another possibility: the crude compound is a racemic mixture, but for a diastereomer, not an enantiomer. Wait, no—racemic is about enantiomers. Diastereomers are different.

Wait, let me think about the options again. Option B is enantiomers; NMR would not distinguish them, so the same number of peaks. So if it's a racemic mixture, the NMR would look the same as a pure sample. So in the question, the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton, which shouldn't happen if it's a racemic mixture.

So, perhaps it's not B.

Option D: diastereomers. So, for diastereomers, the NMR would show different shifts for each. But if the two diastereomers have the same alpha proton environment, the shifts would be the same. But that's unusual because diastereomers have different physical properties, so the shifts would be different.

Wait, but some diastereomers can have similar shifts if the environment is not significantly different. Maybe if the diastereomerism is in another part of the molecule, the alpha proton could be in a similar environment. So the two peaks are from the same proton in each diastereomer, but similar enough shifts that they appear as two separate peaks.

But the LC-MS shows two peaks, meaning two different compounds. So if the diastereomers are present, they would separate in the LC, and each would have the same mass because same molecular formula. So that fits.

So putting it together: the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton because there are two diastereomers, each with the same proton, but slight differences in environment causing similar but separate shifts. The LC-MS shows two peaks because they're separated, same mass.

So the most likely answer is D.

But wait, another possibility is that the compound is a mixture of two different tautomers. But tautomers usually have different molecular weights because of the loss of a proton and rearrangement. So the mass would differ, I think. So not matching the LC-MS data.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is with the synthesis—like some byproduct is formed. But the options don't include that, so I have to choose from the given options.

Another point: the NMR has two peaks for the same alpha proton. If the molecule is a diastereomer, the alpha proton's environment would change, leading to different shifts. But the shifts are similar, so perhaps the diastereomers are similar in the alpha region.

Wait, but if the diastereomers are in a trans and cis configuration in another part of the molecule, the alpha proton's environment doesn't change much, so the shifts are similar. But then, why would the same alpha proton split into two? Because each diastereomer has that proton.

Wait, but the integral is 1H in total. So for each diastereomer, the alpha proton would account for 0.5 H. So the two diastereomers are present in equal amounts, each contributing 0.5 H.

So, that would explain the two similar peaks. And in the LC-MS, each diastereomer is present, same mass, so two peaks.

So that fits option D: mixture of diastereoisomers.

Another possibility is that the crude compound has a side product, but the mass is the same, so perhaps it's the same molecular weight but a different structure.

Alternatively, option C: double coupling during amide bond formation. Maybe that leads to two different products, but I'm not sure.

Wait, amide bond formation can lead to different stereochemistry in the amide. For example, in a substitution reaction, you could form different diastereomers if the reaction leads to different configurations at the amide nitrogen.

Wait, but in that case, the NMR would show different shifts for the alpha protons adjacent to the amide. So perhaps the amide's alpha proton is split into two due to different diastereomers.

So, this could be the case. So, C and D are both possibilities.

Wait, option C says 'double coupling' during an amide bond forming reaction. I'm not exactly sure what that refers to. Double coupling might imply that the proton is coupled to two different sets of protons, but the question says spin-spin coupling is ruled out.

So, if it's double coupling due to reaction conditions, but the coupling isn't spin-spin, perhaps it's something else like dipolar coupling or something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps during the formation of the amide bond, two different products were formed with different configurations, leading to diastereomers. So that would align with option D.

So, putting it all together, the most likely explanation is that the crude compound is a mixture of diastereoisomers (option D). The two peaks in the NMR correspond to the same alpha proton in each diastereomer, which have similar but slightly different environments, leading to similar shifts. The LC-MS shows two peaks because they're separated, but same mass since same molecular formula.

The question involves analyzing a small peptidic compound where the 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks corresponding to the same alpha-proton, with similar chemical shifts and equal integrals (together integrating to 1H). LC-MS analysis reveals two peaks of equal intensity, both with the same mass spectrum as the expected molecule. The goal is to determine the most likely explanation for these observations.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: The compound is contaminated with a precursor**  
   A precursor would typically have a different molecular weight than the expected product, as it would lack a portion that has been cleaved or modified during synthesis. However, the LC-MS data shows two peaks with the same mass as the expected molecule, ruling out this option.

2. **Option B: The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers**  
   Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images and have identical physical and chemical environments for all protons, including the alpha-proton. This would result in a single peak in the NMR spectrum, not two distinct peaks. Additionally, a racemic mixture would not explain the two peaks in the LC-MS spectrum, as enantiomers would co-elute under normal conditions. Thus, this option is unlikely.

3. **Option C: 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction**  
   The question explicitly states that spin-spin coupling has been ruled out as the cause of the duplicate peaks. While "double coupling" could theoretically refer to other types of interactions (e.g., dipolar coupling), this explanation is less specific and does not align well with the observations. Furthermore, this option does not directly account for the two peaks in the LC-MS spectrum.

4. **Option D: The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers**  
   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images and have different physical properties, including NMR chemical shifts. If the crude compound is a mixture of diastereoisomers, the alpha-proton could exist in slightly different environments in each isomer, leading to two distinct peaks in the NMR spectrum with similar but not identical chemical shifts. The LC-MS data, showing two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass, supports this explanation, as diastereoisomers have the same molecular formula and thus the same mass. This option aligns well with both the NMR and LC-MS observations.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers. The two peaks in the NMR spectrum correspond to the same alpha-proton in each diastereomer, which have similar but slightly different environments, and the two peaks in the LC-MS spectrum reflect the presence of two distinct diastereoisomers.
