Okay, so I have this physics problem here about spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says there are four identical spin-1/2 particles in the well of length L. I need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are given, so maybe I can figure it out step by step.

Wait, each particle is a spin-1/2, which means they can have spin up or down. But in a one-dimensional infinite well, the energy levels are determined by the quantum number n. Right, the energy for a single particle in such a well is given by E_n = (n² π² ħ²)/(2mL²), which the question simplifies to E multiplied by n², since E is defined as pi² ħ²/(2mL²). So each particle's energy is n² * E.

But wait, the particles are identical fermions, so they have to obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means no two particles can have the same set of quantum numbers. In a 1D well, each particle's state is described by their quantum number n and their spin. But since spin can be up or down, each n can hold two particles: one spin-up and one spin-down.

So for four particles, how do their quantum numbers look in different states?

The ground state would be the lowest energy configuration possible. Since each n can take two particles (with opposite spins), let's see. The lowest states are n=1, n=2, etc.

Ground state: Let's fill up the lowest energy levels. For four particles, each level can have two, so maybe n=1 (2 particles), n=2 (2 particles). Wait, but wait, that would be the first four particles. But wait, four particles would fill up n=1 and n=2 each with two particles. So the energies would be E(1²) = E, E(2²)=4E. So the total energy of the system would be the sum of each particle's energy.

Wait no, no, each particle has their own energy. So for the ground state, each particle in n=1 contributes E, and each in n=2 contributes 4E.

Wait, but if all four particles are in the same state, that can't be because of the Pauli exclusion. So for four particles, n=1 can take two (spin up and down), n=2 can take another two. So the ground state is four particles: two in n=1 and two in n=2. So the system's total energy would be (2 * E) + (2 * 4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E. Wait, but wait: the energies are additive for each particle. So each particle in n=1 contributes E, each in n=2 contributes 4E. So 2 particles in n=1 give 2E, and 2 in n=2 give 8E, total 10E. So the ground state energy is 10E.

Wait, but wait. The problem is asking for the energies of the ground state, first excited, and second excited. Wait, no, wait the question says 'calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system in terms of E.' Hmm, but when they say 'energies', do they mean the total energy of the system, or the individual energy levels? I think they mean the total energy of the system, so the sum of each particle's energy.

Wait, but the options have 10E as one of the possibilities. Let me check.

But let me think again. So for four fermions in a 1D well, each with spin 1/2, the lowest possible configuration (ground state) would have the two lowest n levels filled with two particles each. So n=1 and n=2, each with two particles. So the energies are 1² E and 2² E. So each n=1 contributes E, two of them make 2E. Each n=2 contributes 4E, two of them make 8E. So the total energy is 2E + 8E = 10E.

So the ground state of the system would be 10E. Wait, but looking at the options, option B has 10E as the first excited state. Hmm, maybe I'm miscalculating something.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible states and how the energy levels are filled. Let's think about the possible states step by step.

Each quantum level n can hold two particles (spin up and spin down). So for four particles, the ground state is n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles). Total energy is 2*(1² E) + 2*(2² E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B's first excited state is 10E. Hmm, that can't be, because the ground state should be the lowest possible energy. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state refers to the next higher energy state beyond the ground state. Let me think about the possible next states.

Wait, maybe in the ground state, all four particles are filled into the lowest possible n levels. The next possible state might involve one particle moving to a higher n. Let me think: in the ground state, we have two particles in n=1 and two in n=2. The first excited state could be when the highest filled level's quantum number increases.

Wait no, wait, the first excited state would be the next possible configuration with the least energy higher than the ground state. Alternatively, maybe the first excited state is when one particle moves up from n=2 to n=3. Or perhaps a different arrangement.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between the ground state, first excited, and second excited for the system. Let me clarify.

The ground state is the lowest possible energy. The first excited state is the next higher energy, and second excited is the next after that.

So, in the ground state, system is 2 in n=1, 2 in n=2. Total energy is 10E.

Now, the first excited state: what's the next possible configuration? Since the particles are fermions, we can't have more than two in any n. So maybe one of the n=2 particles moves up to n=3. But wait, can we have a lower energy configuration? Let me think.

Wait, when you have four particles:

Ground state: n=1 (2), n=2 (2).

Now, for the first excited state, perhaps we can promote one particle from n=2 to n=3. So now, the configuration would be n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). Because we can have only two in n=2, but I think no, because we can't have more than two in any n. Wait, no, the n=2 level can hold two particles. Wait, in ground state, n=2 is filled with two. So if we move one from n=2 to n=3, then n=2 has one, and n=3 has one, plus n=1 remains with two. But wait, n=2 can't have less than two particles unless we have a higher state. So maybe the first excited state is when another level is filled.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when the particles are arranged as n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1), and n=4 (0). Wait, but that's not possible because each level can only hold two particles.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think in terms of the possible states and their energies.

Each particle's energy is E * n², where n is the quantum number.

In the ground state, the four particles would fill the lowest two levels: n=1 and n=2, with two particles each. So the system's energy is 2*(1² E) + 2*(2² E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.

Now, what's the next possible state? The first excited state would be the next higher energy state possible. So perhaps one of the particles in n=2 moves to n=3. So now, the configuration is n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). But wait, each n can have two particles, so why would a particle move to n=3 if n=2 isn't filled? Wait, no, because in the ground state, n=2 is filled with two. So perhaps the first excited state would involve another particle moving to a higher level, but that doesn't make sense because you can't have more than two in any n.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The ground state is the lowest possible energy, so for four fermions, each with spin 1/2, filling up the lowest available n's with maximum two each. So n=1:2, n=2:2. Now, the next possible state (first excited) would involve the next available state. But all lower states are filled. So the next available state is n=3, but only with one particle. Wait, but why would that be the case? Because the next available state is n=3, but since each n can hold two, perhaps the first excited state would have two particles in n=3 and one in n=2, but no, that would require changing the configuration.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when the particles are arranged as n=1, n=1, n=2, n=3. Wait, but that would require placing a particle in n=3, which is higher in energy. But that can't be because in the ground state, the two in n=2 are already filled. So perhaps the first excited state is when two particles are in n=2, one in n=3, and one in the same n=1.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the possible energy levels of the system.

Each particle's energy is E * n². So for four particles, the possible configurations are:

Ground state: 2 in n=1 (each E), 2 in n=2 (each 4E). Total energy: 10E.

First excited state: perhaps one particle moves up to n=3. So the configuration would be 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3. The total energy would be 2E + 1*(4E) + 1*(9E) = 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Wait, that makes the first excited state 15E. But wait, is that the next possible energy? Because 10E is the ground state, next is 15E.

But looking at the options, let's see: option D has 10E, 15E, 18E. So if that's the case, perhaps the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, and second excited 18E.

Wait, but wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Because if the first excited state is 15E, then the second excited would be higher. Let me think about what other configurations are possible.

Another possible configuration could be 2 in n=1, 2 in n=3. But that would require four particles. Wait, no, because 2 in n=1 and 2 in n=3 would sum to four. So the total energy would be 2*(1E) + 2*(9E) = 2E +18E=20E.

Wait, but 15E is lower than 20E, so that would be a lower energy state than 20E. So why would the first excited state be 15E and the next 18E? Hmm, perhaps I'm not considering all possibilities.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle moves from n=2 to n=3, making the configuration 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3. Total energy: 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Then, the second excited state could be when another particle moves up, perhaps to n=4. So configuration would be 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4. Energy is 2E +4E +16E=22E. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, maybe the first excited state is when the particles are arranged as 2 in n=1, 2 in n=3. Wait, but that would have 2*(1E) + 2*(9E)=20E. But 15E is lower than that, so I think 15E comes before 20E. So the first excited state would be 15E, second excited is 20E.

But looking at the options, I don't see 20E in any of them. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3, making the configuration 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3, giving 15E. The second excited state would then be when another particle is promoted, perhaps to n=4 or n=3 again.

Wait, but wait, each n can hold two particles. So if n=3 can take two, perhaps in the first excited state, you have 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, and 1 in n=3. The next state could be when another particle moves to n=3, making it 2 in n=3, and 2 in n=1. So the configuration would be 2 in n=1, 2 in n=3. The energy would be 2E + 2*(9E)=2E +18E=20E. So the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 20E. But none of the options have 20E except option B, which has 50E as third. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the states are filled in a way that minimizes the total energy, but when considering the first and second excited states, you're looking at the next possible higher energy states.

Wait, maybe another approach. For four spin-1/2 particles, the possible allowed states are such that each n can have two. So the filling order is n=1 (2), n=2 (2), n=3 (0), n=4 (0), etc.

Wait, but in the ground state, the four particles are filled in the lowest two n levels. So for the first excited state, perhaps the next available state is when one of the particles in n=2 moves up to n=3. But that would leave n=2 with one particle, and n=3 with one. So the configuration is 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3. The total energy is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

The second excited state could involve moving another particle from n=2 to n=4, making the configuration 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 1 in n=3, 1 in n=4. Wait, but that would require taking a particle from n=2, but in the first excited state, n=2 has only one. So perhaps the second excited state would have two particles in n=3, as that's the next available level. So configuration becomes 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3. Total energy is 2E + 2*(9E) = 2E +18E=20E.

But looking at the options, none of them have 20E as the third state. So perhaps I'm not considering the correct way of filling the states.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when all four particles are in n=1 and n=2, but with a different arrangement. No, that can't be because in the ground state they are already filled.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when a particle moves from n=2 to n=3, giving 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3. The energy is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Then, the second excited state could be when another particle moves from n=2 to n=4, making the configuration 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 1 in n=3, 1 in n=4. The energy would be 2E + 0*(4E) + 9E + 16E= 2E +9E +16E=27E.

But 27E isn't among the options either. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the first and second excited states don't involve moving particles beyond n=3. Maybe the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3, making the configuration 2 in n=1, 2 in n=3. Then the total energy is 2E + 2*(9E)=2E +18E=20E. So the ground state is 10E, first excited state is 15E, second excited is 20E.

But the options don't have 20E. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A) 30E, 39E, 50E

B) 4E, 10E, 50E

C) 4E, 10E, 15E

D) 10E, 15E, 18E

Hmm, option D has 10E, 15E, 18E. So if the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E.

Wait, 18E would be the case if the configuration is 2 in n=1 and 2 in n=3, giving 2E + 18E=20E. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4, so the configuration is 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4. The energy would be 2E +4E +16E=22E. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in considering which states are allowed. Maybe the first excited state is when the particles are arranged as n=1, n=1, n=2, n=3, leading to energy 2E +4E +9E=15E. Then, the second excited state is when a particle moves from n=3 to n=4, making the configuration 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4. The energy would be 2E +4E +16E=22E.

Hmm, none of the options have 22E. So perhaps I'm missing a better way to approach this.

Alternatively, perhaps the total energy isn't the sum of individual energies but some other approach, but that can't be right. The system's energy is the sum of the energies of each particle.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible total energies for each state.

Wait, another approach: the four particles are spin-1/2, so their total spin isn't directly relevant here. But their arrangement in the well depends on their n values.

Let me think of the possible ways to assign the four particles to the n levels, considering that each n can have up to two particles.

Possible configurations:

1. All four in n=1 and n=2: 2 in n=1, 2 in n=2. Energy sum: 2E + 8E = 10E (ground state).

2. 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3: sum 2E +4E +9E =15E (first excited state).

3. 2 in n=1, 2 in n=3: sum 2E + 18E=20E (second excited state).

But the options don't have 20E. So perhaps the way the states are filled is different.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state isn't about moving just one particle, but about another arrangement. Let me think of the possible next allowed energy levels.

Wait, maybe the first excited state is when two particles are in n=2, and the other two are in n=3. So 2 in n=2 (each 4E) and 2 in n=3 (each 9E). Sum is (2*4E)+(2*9E)=8E +18E=26E. But that's higher than 15E, which would be the first excited state.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and the rest in lower levels, but that's 15E as before.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when the particles are arranged as n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1), giving 15E. Then the second excited state would be when another particle moves to n=4, making the configuration 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4: sum is 2E+4E+16E=22E.

But again, 22E isn't in the options. Hmm.

I must be missing something. Let me think about the possible options.

Looking at the options, option D says 10E, 15E, 18E. How could 18E happen?

Wait, 18E would be the case if two particles are in n=3 (each 9E) and none in n=2. So 2 in n=1 (2E) and 2 in n=3 (18E) → 20E. So that's not 18E.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=2. So configuration is 2 in n=2 (8E) and 2 in n=3 (18E). Sum is 26E. But that's not an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when the particles are arranged as 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3, giving 15E. The second excited state could be when one particle in n=2 moves to n=4, so the configuration is 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 1 in n=3, 1 in n=4: sum is 2E +0 +9E +16E=27E. No, not matching.

Wait, let me think about the possible system energies based on the options.

Option D says ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second 18E.

How could 18E happen? Let me see: 18E=18*(E), which is 3² * 2E. Hmm, perhaps that's not helping.

Alternatively, maybe the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=2. So sum is 2*(4E) + 2*(9E) =8E +18E=26E. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when particles are arranged as 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, and 1 in n=3. Sum 15E.

The second excited state is when another particle moves to n=4, making the configuration 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4. Sum is 2E +4E +16E=22E. But none of the options have that.

Wait, perhaps after the first excited state (15E), the next possible state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=2. So sum is (2*4E)+(2*9E)=8E +18E=26E. But 26E isn't in any options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the options again.

Option D: 10E, 15E, 18E.

If the ground state is 10E, first excited is 15E, second excited is 18E.

How can the second excited state be 18E? Let me see:

Wait, 18E could be the sum when two particles are in n=3 (each 9E) and two in n=2 (each 4E), but that would be 2*(9E) + 2*(4E) = 18E +8E=26E. Not 18E.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4, and another in n=3. But that would give more energy.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when three particles are in n=2 and one in n=3. But wait, each n can have a maximum of two particles. So n=2 can't have three. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, maybe the second excited state is when the configuration is 2 in n=3 and 2 in n=4. Sum is 2*(9E) + 2*(16E)=18E +32E=50E. But that's option A's third state.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=2. Then the sum is 8E +18E=26E. Not in the options.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the possible energies.

Ground state: sum=10E.

First excited state: next possible sum is 15E (as in option D).

Second excited state: next sum is 18E.

But how to get 18E?

Wait, wait, 18E could be when the four particles are arranged as 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, and 1 in n=3. Let's see: 1E + 2*(4E) +9E=1E+8E +9E=18E. So configuration is n=1:1, n=2:2, n=3:1. But can that be possible?

Wait, but in the ground state, n=2 is filled with two particles. So if in the first excited state, n=2 has two, perhaps moving one to n=3. But then n=2 would have one, n=3 would have one, and n=1 has two, giving sum 15E.

Alternatively, if the configuration is n=1:1, n=2:2, n=3:1, which requires four particles. So one in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3. But wait, in the ground state, n=2 is filled with two particles. So in the first excited state, one particle moves up to n=3, making n=2 have one and n=3 have one, giving sum 15E. So that's first excited.

Then, the second excited state could involve moving another particle to n=3 or higher. If another particle moves to n=3, then we have n=1:1, n=2:1, n=3:2. Sum would be 1E +4E + 2*9E=1E +4E +18E=23E. Not matching options.

Alternatively, if a particle moves from n=3 to n=4, sum would increase even more.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and one in n=4, but that's getting too complicated.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me see the options again.

Option D says the energies are 10E, 15E, 18E.

If the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, and second excited 18E, then the second excited must come from a configuration that sums to 18E.

So how can I get 18E?

Sum of four particles: sum = a*1E + b*4E + c*9E + d*16E, where a + b + c + d =4, and each a, b, c, d <=2.

Looking for a sum of 18E.

Let me try possible combinations:

- a=2, b=2, c=0, d=0 → sum=2E +8E=10E → ground state.

- a=2, b=1, c=1 → sum=2E +4E +9E=15E → first excited.

- a=0, b=2, c=2 → sum=0 +8E +18E=26E → not 18E.

- a=1, b=2, c=1 → sum=1E +8E +9E=18E. So configuration is n=1:1, n=2:2, n=3:1. That works. So the sum is 1E +8E +9E=18E. So that's the second excited state.

Wait, but how does this configuration compare in energy to the first excited state?

First excited state is when a=2, b=1, c=1, sum=15E.

Second excited state is when a=1, b=2, c=1, sum=18E.

So that would make option D correct.

But why is this configuration higher than the first excited state?

Because in the first excited state, the particles are at lower n levels. But in the second excited state, some are promoted to higher n, leading to a higher total energy.

So the ground state is 10E, first excited is 15E, second excited is 18E, which matches option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we analyze the system as follows:

### Key Points:
1. **Energy Levels in a 1D Infinite Well**:  
   The energy of a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well is given by:  
   \[
   E_n = n^2 E \quad \text{where } E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2}.
   \]  
   For four particles, the total energy of the system is the sum of the individual energies of the particles.

2. **Pauli Exclusion Principle**:  
   Since the particles are fermions, no two particles can occupy the same quantum state. Each quantum level \(n\) can hold at most two particles (one spin-up and one spin-down).

3. **Ground State Configuration**:  
   In the ground state, the particles occupy the lowest available energy levels. The lowest two levels, \(n=1\) and \(n=2\), are filled with two particles each.  
   - Total energy:  
     \[
     E_{\text{ground}} = 2(1^2 E) + 2(2^2 E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.
     \]

4. **First Excited State Configuration**:  
   In the first excited state, one particle is promoted from \(n=2\) to \(n=3\). The configuration becomes:  
   - \(n=1\): 2 particles, \(n=2\): 1 particle, \(n=3\): 1 particle.  
   - Total energy:  
     \[
     E_{\text{first excited}} = 2(1^2 E) + 1(2^2 E) + 1(3^2 E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.
     \]

5. **Second Excited State Configuration**:  
   In the second excited state, another particle is promoted from \(n=2\) to \(n=3\). The configuration becomes:  
   - \(n=1\): 1 particle, \(n=2\): 2 particles, \(n=3\): 1 particle.  
   - Total energy:  
     \[
     E_{\text{second excited}} = 1(1^2 E) + 2(2^2 E) + 1(3^2 E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.
     \]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (30E, 39E, 50E)**: These values are much higher than the calculated energies and do not match the expected configurations.  
- **Option B (4E, 10E, 50E)**: The ground state is correct at 10E, but the first and second excited states are incorrect.  
- **Option C (4E, 10E, 15E)**: The ground state is correct at 10E, but the second excited state is incorrect.  
- **Option D (10E, 15E, 18E)**: Matches the calculated energies for the ground state (10E), first excited state (15E), and second excited state (18E).

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option D**, as it accurately reflects the total energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state based on the particle configurations and energy calculations.

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I have this physics problem here about spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says there are four identical spin-1/2 particles in the well of length L. I need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are given, so maybe I can figure it out step by step.

Wait, each particle is a spin-1/2, which means they can have spin up or down. But in a one-dimensional infinite well, the energy levels are determined by the quantum number n. Right, the energy for a single particle in such a well is given by E_n = (n² π² ħ²)/(2mL²), which the question simplifies to E multiplied by n², since E is defined as pi² ħ²/(2mL²). So each particle's energy is n² * E.

But wait, the particles are identical fermions, so they have to obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means no two particles can have the same set of quantum numbers. In a 1D well, each particle's state is described by their quantum number n and their spin. But since spin can be up or down, each n can hold two particles: one spin-up and one spin-down.

So for four particles, how do their quantum numbers look in different states?

The ground state would be the lowest energy configuration possible. Since each n can take two particles (with opposite spins), let's see. The lowest states are n=1, n=2, etc.

Ground state: Let's fill up the lowest energy levels. For four particles, each level can have two, so maybe n=1 (2 particles), n=2 (2 particles). Wait, but wait, that would be the first four particles. But wait, four particles would fill up n=1 and n=2 each with two particles. So the energies would be E(1²) = E, E(2²)=4E. So the total energy of the system would be the sum of each particle's energy.

Wait no, no, each particle has their own energy. So for the ground state, each particle in n=1 contributes E, and each in n=2 contributes 4E.

Wait, but if all four particles are in the same state, that can't be because of the Pauli exclusion. So for four particles, n=1 can take two (spin up and down), n=2 can take another two. So the ground state is four particles: two in n=1 and two in n=2. So the system's total energy would be (2 * E) + (2 * 4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E. Wait, but wait: the energies are additive for each particle. So each particle in n=1 contributes E, each in n=2 contributes 4E. So 2 particles in n=1 give 2E, and 2 in n=2 give 8E, total 10E. So the ground state energy is 10E.

Wait, but wait. The problem is asking for the energies of the ground state, first excited, and second excited. Wait, no, wait the question says 'calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system in terms of E.' Hmm, but when they say 'energies', do they mean the total energy of the system, or the individual energy levels? I think they mean the total energy of the system, so the sum of each particle's energy.

Wait, but the options have 10E as one of the possibilities. Let me check.

But let me think again. So for four fermions in a 1D well, each with spin 1/2, the lowest possible configuration (ground state) would have the two lowest n levels filled with two particles each. So n=1 and n=2, each with two particles. So the energies are 1² E and 2² E. So each n=1 contributes E, two of them make 2E. Each n=2 contributes 4E, two of them make 8E. So the total energy is 2E + 8E = 10E.

So the ground state of the system would be 10E. Wait, but looking at the options, option B has 10E as the first excited state. Hmm, maybe I'm miscalculating something.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible states and how the energy levels are filled. Let's think about the possible states step by step.

Each quantum level n can hold two particles (spin up and spin down). So for four particles, the ground state is n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles). Total energy is 2*(1² E) + 2*(2² E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B's first excited state is 10E. Hmm, that can't be, because the ground state should be the lowest possible energy. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state refers to the next higher energy state beyond the ground state. Let me think about the possible next states.

Wait, maybe in the ground state, all four particles are filled into the lowest possible n levels. The next possible state might involve one particle moving to a higher n. Let me think: in the ground state, we have two particles in n=1 and two in n=2. The first excited state could be when the highest filled level's quantum number increases.

Wait no, wait, the first excited state would be the next possible configuration with the least energy higher than the ground state. Alternatively, maybe the first excited state is when one particle moves up from n=2 to n=3. Or perhaps a different arrangement.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between the ground state, first excited, and second excited for the system. Let me clarify.

The ground state is the lowest possible energy. The first excited state is the next higher energy, and second excited is the next after that.

So, in the ground state, system is 2 in n=1, 2 in n=2. Total energy is 10E.

Now, the first excited state: what's the next possible configuration? Since the particles are fermions, we can't have more than two in any n. So maybe one of the n=2 particles moves up to n=3. But wait, can we have a lower energy configuration? Let me think.

Wait, when you have four particles:

Ground state: n=1 (2), n=2 (2).

Now, for the first excited state, perhaps we can promote one particle from n=2 to n=3. So now, the configuration would be n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). Because we can have only two in n=2, but I think no, because we can't have more than two in any n. Wait, no, the n=2 level can hold two particles. Wait, in ground state, n=2 is filled with two. So if we move one from n=2 to n=3, then n=2 has one, and n=3 has one, plus n=1 remains with two. But wait, n=2 can't have less than two particles unless we have a higher state. So maybe the first excited state is when another level is filled.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when the particles are arranged as n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1), and n=4 (0). Wait, but that's not possible because each level can only hold two particles.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think in terms of the possible states and their energies.

Each particle's energy is E * n², where n is the quantum number.

In the ground state, the four particles would fill the lowest two levels: n=1 and n=2, with two particles each. So the system's energy is 2*(1² E) + 2*(2² E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.

Now, what's the next possible state? The first excited state would be the next higher energy state possible. So perhaps one of the particles in n=2 moves to n=3. So now, the configuration is n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). But wait, each n can have two particles, so why would a particle move to n=3 if n=2 isn't filled? Wait, no, because in the ground state, n=2 is filled with two. So perhaps the first excited state would involve another particle moving to a higher level, but that doesn't make sense because you can't have more than two in any n.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The ground state is the lowest possible energy, so for four fermions, each with spin 1/2, filling up the lowest available n's with maximum two each. So n=1:2, n=2:2. Now, the next possible state (first excited) would involve the next available state. But all lower states are filled. So the next available state is n=3, but only with one particle. Wait, but why would that be the case? Because the next available state is n=3, but since each n can hold two, perhaps the first excited state would have two particles in n=3 and one in n=2, but no, that would require changing the configuration.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when the particles are arranged as n=1, n=1, n=2, n=3. Wait, but that would require placing a particle in n=3, which is higher in energy. But that can't be because in the ground state, the two in n=2 are already filled. So perhaps the first excited state is when two particles are in n=2, one in n=3, and one in the same n=1.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the possible energy levels of the system.

Each particle's energy is E * n². So for four particles, the possible configurations are:

Ground state: 2 in n=1 (each E), 2 in n=2 (each 4E). Total energy: 10E.

First excited state: perhaps one particle moves up to n=3. So the configuration would be 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3. The total energy would be 2E + 1*(4E) + 1*(9E) = 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Wait, that makes the first excited state 15E. But wait, is that the next possible energy? Because 10E is the ground state, next is 15E.

But looking at the options, let's see: option D has 10E, 15E, 18E. So if that's the case, perhaps the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, and second excited 18E.

Wait, but wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Because if the first excited state is 15E, then the second excited would be higher. Let me think about what other configurations are possible.

Another possible configuration could be 2 in n=1, 2 in n=3. But that would require four particles. Wait, no, because 2 in n=1 and 2 in n=3 would sum to four. So the total energy would be 2*(1E) + 2*(9E) = 2E +18E=20E.

Wait, but 15E is lower than 20E, so that would be a lower energy state than 20E. So why would the first excited state be 15E and the next 18E? Hmm, perhaps I'm not considering all possibilities.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle moves from n=2 to n=3, making the configuration 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3. Total energy: 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Then, the second excited state could be when another particle moves up, perhaps to n=4. So configuration would be 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4. Energy is 2E +4E +16E=22E. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, maybe the first excited state is when the particles are arranged as 2 in n=1, 2 in n=3. Wait, but that would have 2*(1E) + 2*(9E)=20E. But 15E is lower than that, so I think 15E comes before 20E. So the first excited state would be 15E, second excited is 20E.

But looking at the options, I don't see 20E in any of them. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3, making the configuration 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3, giving 15E. The second excited state would then be when another particle is promoted, perhaps to n=4 or n=3 again.

Wait, but wait, each n can hold two particles. So if n=3 can take two, perhaps in the first excited state, you have 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, and 1 in n=3. The next state could be when another particle moves to n=3, making it 2 in n=3, and 2 in n=1. So the configuration would be 2 in n=1, 2 in n=3. The energy would be 2E + 2*(9E)=2E +18E=20E. So the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 20E. But none of the options have 20E except option B, which has 50E as third. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the states are filled in a way that minimizes the total energy, but when considering the first and second excited states, you're looking at the next possible higher energy states.

Wait, maybe another approach. For four spin-1/2 particles, the possible allowed states are such that each n can have two. So the filling order is n=1 (2), n=2 (2), n=3 (0), n=4 (0), etc.

Wait, but in the ground state, the four particles are filled in the lowest two n levels. So for the first excited state, perhaps the next available state is when one of the particles in n=2 moves up to n=3. But that would leave n=2 with one particle, and n=3 with one. So the configuration is 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3. The total energy is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

The second excited state could involve moving another particle from n=2 to n=4, making the configuration 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 1 in n=3, 1 in n=4. Wait, but that would require taking a particle from n=2, but in the first excited state, n=2 has only one. So perhaps the second excited state would have two particles in n=3, as that's the next available level. So configuration becomes 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3. Total energy is 2E + 2*(9E) = 2E +18E=20E.

But looking at the options, none of them have 20E as the third state. So perhaps I'm not considering the correct way of filling the states.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when all four particles are in n=1 and n=2, but with a different arrangement. No, that can't be because in the ground state they are already filled.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when a particle moves from n=2 to n=3, giving 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3. The energy is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Then, the second excited state could be when another particle moves from n=2 to n=4, making the configuration 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 1 in n=3, 1 in n=4. The energy would be 2E + 0*(4E) + 9E + 16E= 2E +9E +16E=27E.

But 27E isn't among the options either. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the first and second excited states don't involve moving particles beyond n=3. Maybe the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3, making the configuration 2 in n=1, 2 in n=3. Then the total energy is 2E + 2*(9E)=2E +18E=20E. So the ground state is 10E, first excited state is 15E, second excited is 20E.

But the options don't have 20E. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A) 30E, 39E, 50E

B) 4E, 10E, 50E

C) 4E, 10E, 15E

D) 10E, 15E, 18E

Hmm, option D has 10E, 15E, 18E. So if the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E.

Wait, 18E would be the case if the configuration is 2 in n=1 and 2 in n=3, giving 2E + 18E=20E. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4, so the configuration is 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4. The energy would be 2E +4E +16E=22E. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in considering which states are allowed. Maybe the first excited state is when the particles are arranged as n=1, n=1, n=2, n=3, leading to energy 2E +4E +9E=15E. Then, the second excited state is when a particle moves from n=3 to n=4, making the configuration 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4. The energy would be 2E +4E +16E=22E.

Hmm, none of the options have 22E. So perhaps I'm missing a better way to approach this.

Alternatively, perhaps the total energy isn't the sum of individual energies but some other approach, but that can't be right. The system's energy is the sum of the energies of each particle.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible total energies for each state.

Wait, another approach: the four particles are spin-1/2, so their total spin isn't directly relevant here. But their arrangement in the well depends on their n values.

Let me think of the possible ways to assign the four particles to the n levels, considering that each n can have up to two particles.

Possible configurations:

1. All four in n=1 and n=2: 2 in n=1, 2 in n=2. Energy sum: 2E + 8E = 10E (ground state).

2. 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3: sum 2E +4E +9E =15E (first excited state).

3. 2 in n=1, 2 in n=3: sum 2E + 18E=20E (second excited state).

But the options don't have 20E. So perhaps the way the states are filled is different.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state isn't about moving just one particle, but about another arrangement. Let me think of the possible next allowed energy levels.

Wait, maybe the first excited state is when two particles are in n=2, and the other two are in n=3. So 2 in n=2 (each 4E) and 2 in n=3 (each 9E). Sum is (2*4E)+(2*9E)=8E +18E=26E. But that's higher than 15E, which would be the first excited state.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and the rest in lower levels, but that's 15E as before.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when the particles are arranged as n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1), giving 15E. Then the second excited state would be when another particle moves to n=4, making the configuration 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4: sum is 2E+4E+16E=22E.

But again, 22E isn't in the options. Hmm.

I must be missing something. Let me think about the possible options.

Looking at the options, option D says 10E, 15E, 18E. How could 18E happen?

Wait, 18E would be the case if two particles are in n=3 (each 9E) and none in n=2. So 2 in n=1 (2E) and 2 in n=3 (18E) → 20E. So that's not 18E.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=2. So configuration is 2 in n=2 (8E) and 2 in n=3 (18E). Sum is 26E. But that's not an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when the particles are arranged as 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3, giving 15E. The second excited state could be when one particle in n=2 moves to n=4, so the configuration is 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 1 in n=3, 1 in n=4: sum is 2E +0 +9E +16E=27E. No, not matching.

Wait, let me think about the possible system energies based on the options.

Option D says ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second 18E.

How could 18E happen? Let me see: 18E=18*(E), which is 3² * 2E. Hmm, perhaps that's not helping.

Alternatively, maybe the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=2. So sum is 2*(4E) + 2*(9E) =8E +18E=26E. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when particles are arranged as 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, and 1 in n=3. Sum 15E.

The second excited state is when another particle moves to n=4, making the configuration 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4. Sum is 2E +4E +16E=22E. But none of the options have that.

Wait, perhaps after the first excited state (15E), the next possible state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=2. So sum is (2*4E)+(2*9E)=8E +18E=26E. But 26E isn't in any options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the options again.

Option D: 10E, 15E, 18E.

If the ground state is 10E, first excited is 15E, second excited is 18E.

How can the second excited state be 18E? Let me see:

Wait, 18E could be the sum when two particles are in n=3 (each 9E) and two in n=2 (each 4E), but that would be 2*(9E) + 2*(4E) = 18E +8E=26E. Not 18E.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4, and another in n=3. But that would give more energy.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when three particles are in n=2 and one in n=3. But wait, each n can have a maximum of two particles. So n=2 can't have three. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, maybe the second excited state is when the configuration is 2 in n=3 and 2 in n=4. Sum is 2*(9E) + 2*(16E)=18E +32E=50E. But that's option A's third state.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=2. Then the sum is 8E +18E=26E. Not in the options.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the possible energies.

Ground state: sum=10E.

First excited state: next possible sum is 15E (as in option D).

Second excited state: next sum is 18E.

But how to get 18E?

Wait, wait, 18E could be when the four particles are arranged as 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, and 1 in n=3. Let's see: 1E + 2*(4E) +9E=1E+8E +9E=18E. So configuration is n=1:1, n=2:2, n=3:1. But can that be possible?

Wait, but in the ground state, n=2 is filled with two particles. So if in the first excited state, n=2 has two, perhaps moving one to n=3. But then n=2 would have one, n=3 would have one, and n=1 has two, giving sum 15E.

Alternatively, if the configuration is n=1:1, n=2:2, n=3:1, which requires four particles. So one in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3. But wait, in the ground state, n=2 is filled with two particles. So in the first excited state, one particle moves up to n=3, making n=2 have one and n=3 have one, giving sum 15E. So that's first excited.

Then, the second excited state could involve moving another particle to n=3 or higher. If another particle moves to n=3, then we have n=1:1, n=2:1, n=3:2. Sum would be 1E +4E + 2*9E=1E +4E +18E=23E. Not matching options.

Alternatively, if a particle moves from n=3 to n=4, sum would increase even more.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and one in n=4, but that's getting too complicated.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me see the options again.

Option D says the energies are 10E, 15E, 18E.

If the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, and second excited 18E, then the second excited must come from a configuration that sums to 18E.

So how can I get 18E?

Sum of four particles: sum = a*1E + b*4E + c*9E + d*16E, where a + b + c + d =4, and each a, b, c, d <=2.

Looking for a sum of 18E.

Let me try possible combinations:

- a=2, b=2, c=0, d=0 → sum=2E +8E=10E → ground state.

- a=2, b=1, c=1 → sum=2E +4E +9E=15E → first excited.

- a=0, b=2, c=2 → sum=0 +8E +18E=26E → not 18E.

- a=1, b=2, c=1 → sum=1E +8E +9E=18E. So configuration is n=1:1, n=2:2, n=3:1. That works. So the sum is 1E +8E +9E=18E. So that's the second excited state.

Wait, but how does this configuration compare in energy to the first excited state?

First excited state is when a=2, b=1, c=1, sum=15E.

Second excited state is when a=1, b=2, c=1, sum=18E.

So that would make option D correct.

But why is this configuration higher than the first excited state?

Because in the first excited state, the particles are at lower n levels. But in the second excited state, some are promoted to higher n, leading to a higher total energy.

So the ground state is 10E, first excited is 15E, second excited is 18E, which matches option D.


To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we analyze the system as follows:

### Key Points:
1. **Energy Levels in a 1D Infinite Well**:  
   The energy of a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well is given by:  
   \[
   E_n = n^2 E \quad \text{where } E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2}.
   \]  
   For four particles, the total energy of the system is the sum of the individual energies of the particles.

2. **Pauli Exclusion Principle**:  
   Since the particles are fermions, no two particles can occupy the same quantum state. Each quantum level \(n\) can hold at most two particles (one spin-up and one spin-down).

3. **Ground State Configuration**:  
   In the ground state, the particles occupy the lowest available energy levels. The lowest two levels, \(n=1\) and \(n=2\), are filled with two particles each.  
   - Total energy:  
     \[
     E_{\text{ground}} = 2(1^2 E) + 2(2^2 E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.
     \]

4. **First Excited State Configuration**:  
   In the first excited state, one particle is promoted from \(n=2\) to \(n=3\). The configuration becomes:  
   - \(n=1\): 2 particles, \(n=2\): 1 particle, \(n=3\): 1 particle.  
   - Total energy:  
     \[
     E_{\text{first excited}} = 2(1^2 E) + 1(2^2 E) + 1(3^2 E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.
     \]

5. **Second Excited State Configuration**:  
   In the second excited state, another particle is promoted from \(n=2\) to \(n=3\). The configuration becomes:  
   - \(n=1\): 1 particle, \(n=2\): 2 particles, \(n=3\): 1 particle.  
   - Total energy:  
     \[
     E_{\text{second excited}} = 1(1^2 E) + 2(2^2 E) + 1(3^2 E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.
     \]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (30E, 39E, 50E)**: These values are much higher than the calculated energies and do not match the expected configurations.  
- **Option B (4E, 10E, 50E)**: The ground state is correct at 10E, but the first and second excited states are incorrect.  
- **Option C (4E, 10E, 15E)**: The ground state is correct at 10E, but the second excited state is incorrect.  
- **Option D (10E, 15E, 18E)**: Matches the calculated energies for the ground state (10E), first excited state (15E), and second excited state (18E).

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option D**, as it accurately reflects the total energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state based on the particle configurations and energy calculations.

**Answer: D**
