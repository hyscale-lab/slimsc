Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not too confident with pH calculations involving multiple solutions. But let's take it step by step. The question is about determining the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. Whew, that's a mouthful. 

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So I think I need to find out how much acid and base there is and then see if there's excess. After that, I can figure out the pH based on what's left.

Let me jot down the given information:

- 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (acetic acid)
- 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (hydrochloric acid)
- 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (barium hydroxide)

Wait, barium hydroxide is a strong base, right? So when it's dissolved in water, it dissociates completely. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and HCl is a strong acid. So when these are mixed, the H+ ions from the acids will react with the OH- ions from the base.

I think the first step is to calculate the moles of each acid and base.

Let's start with the acetic acid. Molarity (M) is moles per liter. So moles = M * volume (in liters).

CH3COOH: 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles.

Ba(OH)2: Hmm, wait. Barium hydroxide is a strong base, so it dissociates into Ba^2+ and OH- ions. Each formula unit gives 2 OH- per formula unit. So for each mole of Ba(OH)2, we get 2 moles of OH-.

So moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. So moles of OH- from this would be 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, but when we mix all these, the H+ from both acids will react with the OH-.

So total H+ from HCl and CH3COOH. Wait, but HCl is a strong acid, so it will completely dissociate, right? So its H+ is 0.08 moles.

But wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid. It doesn't fully dissociate. But when we're mixing it with a strong base, I think the situation might be a bit different. Wait, maybe I should consider all of them as possible contributors of H+.

Wait, but maybe I should first calculate the total moles of H+ from both acids and the total moles of OH- from the base, then see which is in excess.

So total H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles. But wait, what about the acetic acid? Since it's a weak acid, it doesn't fully dissociate, but when mixed with a base, the H+ from the acetic acid would react as well.

Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the total H+ and OH- as if they are all in solution, but considering that only the strong acid (HCl) contributes completely, and weak acid (CH3COOH) doesn't, but in the presence of a base, the weak acid might contribute some H+.

Wait, maybe I should consider all H+ from HCl and the H+ from CH3COOH, but the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react with H+ from both.

Wait, but maybe it's better to first compute the total moles of H+ and OH-.

Wait, but HCl is a strong acid, so it gives 0.08 moles of H+. Acetic acid is a weak acid, which in pure solution would only partially dissociate, but in the presence of a strong base, perhaps the OH- will deprotonate the acetic acid. Hmm, but perhaps the OH- reacts with the H+ from both sources.

Wait, maybe I should model this by considering all the H+ from HCl and the possible H+ from CH3COOH, but the OH- will neutralize some of them.

Alternatively, perhaps I can treat the situation as a neutralization between H+ and OH-. So the H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH, and OH- comes from Ba(OH)2.

So let me compute total H+ and total OH-.

HCl contributes 0.08 moles H+.

CH3COOH is a weak acid, so maybe it contributes some H+ but not as much as HCl. Wait, but when you mix a weak acid with a base, the base (OH-) will deprotonate the weak acid. So the OH- will react with the H+ from CH3COOH first, and then any excess OH- will react with H+ from HCl.

Wait, no. Because OH- is a strong base, it will react with any available H+.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to find the net moles of H+ or OH- after all possible reactions.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate moles of H+ from all acids (HCl and CH3COOH).

Wait, but CH3COOH doesn't dissociate completely, so the H+ from it is less than 0.05 moles. But when mixing with a strong base, the OH- may react with the acetic acid, pulling H+ out of it.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the total H+ as the sum of H+ from all sources, but considering that the OH- will neutralize some.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the total H+ and total OH- in the solution, then find which is in excess.

Wait, but wait: HCl is a strong acid, so it contributes all its H+ (0.08 moles). Acetic acid contributes some H+, but since it's a weak acid, when mixed with a base, perhaps the OH- will take H+ from the acetic acid first. So perhaps the OH- will neutralize some of the H+ from the acetic acid.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of neutralization reactions.

The strong base (Ba(OH)2) will provide OH- ions. The strong acid (HCl) provides H+ ions. The weak acid (CH3COOH) can provide H+ ions, but perhaps in the presence of OH-, it will not contribute as much because OH- will take H+ from it.

So here's a plan:

1. Calculate moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles.

2. Calculate moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 moles.

3. Now, the OH- will react with H+ from all sources, including the weak acid.

But wait, the H+ from the weak acid is not all present initially. In pure solution, CH3COOH only partially dissociates. But when you add a strong base, the OH- will react with any H+ available, including any that the acetic acid can provide.

So perhaps the OH- will first react with the H+ from HCl, then any remaining OH- will react with the H+ from CH3COOH.

Wait, but perhaps we should model this as:

- OH- (0.18 moles) reacts with H+ from HCl (0.08 moles) and any from CH3COOH.

Wait, but the acetic acid's H+ is not all available. So perhaps the OH- will first neutralize the H+ from the HCl, and then the remaining OH- will neutralize the H+ from the acetic acid.

Wait, let me think: HCl is a strong acid, so all 0.08 moles of H+ are available. The OH- is 0.18 moles.

So 0.18 moles of OH- will react with 0.08 moles of H+ from HCl, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH- remaining.

But wait, wait. That's not correct. Because when OH- reacts with H+, it's a 1:1 reaction. So 0.08 moles of H+ will react with 0.08 moles of OH-, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH-.

So then, the remaining 0.10 moles of OH- will react with the H+ from the acetic acid.

But wait, how much H+ does CH3COOH contribute? Since it's a weak acid, in solution, it doesn't fully dissociate. Let's calculate the initial H+ from CH3COOH.

The formula for a weak acid's dissociation is Ka = [H+][A-]/[HA], where Ka for acetic acid is about 1.8 x 10^-5.

But when you add a strong base, the OH- will deprotonate the acetic acid. So the initial moles of CH3COOH is 0.05 moles.

So the OH- will take H+ from CH3COOH, which is a weak acid. So each mole of OH- will take one mole of H+ from CH3COOH, converting it into CH3COO^-.

But how much OH- is left after neutralizing HCl? 0.10 moles.

So let's see, after the OH- reacts with HCl's H+, there's 0.10 moles of OH- left. That OH- will react with the CH3COOH.

Each mole of OH- will take one mole of CH3COOH and produce one mole of CH3COO^- and one mole of water.

So 0.10 moles of OH- will react with 0.10 moles of CH3COOH, converting it into CH3COO^-.

So the remaining CH3COOH is 0.05 - 0.10 = negative. Wait, that's not possible. So the amount of OH- (0.10 moles) is more than the available CH3COOH (0.05 moles). So all the CH3COOH will be neutralized, and the excess OH- will be 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles.

So now, after all reactions, the solution will have:

- From HCl: all H+ neutralized, so nothing left.

- From CH3COOH: all 0.05 moles converted to CH3COO^-.

- Excess OH-: 0.05 moles.

Wait, but wait. Let me recap:

Total H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles.

Total OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 moles.

Reaction 1: H+ (0.08) + OH- (0.08) → H2O. Remaining OH-: 0.10.

Reaction 2: OH- (0.10) + CH3COOH (0.05) → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So, after this, all 0.05 moles of CH3COOH are neutralized, and there's 0.05 moles of OH- remaining.

So the total solution volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So the concentration of OH- is 0.05 moles / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0416667 M.

Then, pOH = -log(0.0416667) ≈ 1.38.

So pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

Wait, but wait a second. Because after the reactions, the solution has excess OH-, so it's basic. So the pH would be 12.62, which is option A.

But wait, did I account for everything correctly? Let me double-check the steps.

1. Moles of HCl: 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08, correct.

2. Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.18 moles, correct.

3. OH- reacts with H+ from HCl: 0.08 H+ neutralized by 0.08 OH-, leaving 0.10 OH-.

4. Remaining OH- (0.10) reacts with CH3COOH (0.05). But wait, CH3COOH only has 0.05 moles. So 0.05 moles of OH- are consumed, leaving 0.05 moles of OH-.

So total OH- after all reactions is 0.05 moles.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18. First, it neutralizes HCl's H+ (0.08), leaving 0.10 moles of OH-. Then, this 0.10 moles of OH- reacts with CH3COOH. But CH3COOH has 0.05 moles. So 0.05 moles of OH- will neutralize the H+ from CH3COOH, leaving 0.05 moles of OH-.

Wait no, because each mole of OH- can neutralize one mole of H+ from CH3COOH. But CH3COOH only has 0.05 moles of H+ available (since it's a weak acid, but in the presence of a strong base, it will fully deprotonate). So here, the OH- would take H+ from CH3COOH until either the OH- is used up or the CH3COOH is all neutralized.

So after reacting with HCl's H+, the OH- is 0.10. Then, reacting with CH3COOH (0.05 moles), all of the CH3COOH's H+ is neutralized, and 0.05 moles of OH- are consumed, leaving 0.05 moles of OH-.

So yes, that part is correct.

So total OH- is 0.05 moles in 1.2 L.

Concentration [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0416667 M.

pOH = -log(0.0416667) ≈ 1.38.

pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

So the pH is about 12.62, which is option A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 12.62, which matches this. But wait, wait a minute. Let me think again because I'm a bit confused about whether I should consider the H+ from CH3COOH beyond what's neutralized by OH-.

Wait, no, because when OH- is present, it will take H+ from any available source. So in this case, the OH- first neutralizes the strong acid HCl, then the weak acid CH3COOH, and any excess OH- will make the solution basic.

So the OH- in excess is 0.05 moles, which makes the solution basic, so pH is 12.62.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the total H+ and OH-.

Total H+ from HCl: 0.08.

Total H+ from CH3COOH: Let's compute it as if it were a weak acid in solution.

But perhaps that's complicating it. Because when you mix with a strong base, the OH- will take H+ from the weak acid as well, effectively neutralizing it. So perhaps the correct approach is the one I took earlier.

Wait, but what if the OH- is less than the H+ from HCl plus CH3COOH? Then the solution would be acidic. But in this case, since the OH- is 0.18, which is more than the H+ from HCl (0.08) plus CH3COOH's potential H+ (up to 0.05), the remaining OH- would be 0.18 - 0.08 - 0.05 = 0.05, which is what I calculated.

Wait, but wait. The CH3COOH can only contribute up to 0.05 moles of H+ because that's all it has. So, combining all, the total OH- is 0.18. It neutralizes 0.08 H+ from HCl and 0.05 H+ from CH3COOH, leaving 0.05 moles of OH-.

Thus, the solution is basic, so pH is 14 - pOH.

Calculating pOH:

pOH = log (0.05 / 1.2) ?

Wait, no. [OH-] is 0.05 moles in 1.2 L. So [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0416667 M.

pOH = -log(0.0416667) ≈ 1.38.

So pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62, which is option A.

Wait, but what about the other ions in solution? Like, does the presence of Ba^2+ or other ions affect the pH? Probably not, because they are spectator ions.

So yes, the final answer should be A) 12.62.

To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the mixing of 500 mL of 0.1 M CH₃COOH (acetic acid), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (hydrochloric acid), and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)₂ (barium hydroxide). The key steps are as follows:

### Step 1: Calculate moles of H⁺ and OH⁻
- **H⁺ from HCl**:  
  HCl is a strong acid, so it fully dissociates.  
  Moles of H⁺ = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{moles} \).

- **H⁺ from CH₃COOH**:  
  CH₃COOH is a weak acid and does not fully dissociate. However, in the presence of a strong base, the OH⁻ ions will neutralize the H⁺ ions from CH₃COOH.  
  Moles of CH₃COOH = \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{moles} \).

- **OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂**:  
  Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base and fully dissociates. Each formula unit provides 2 OH⁻ ions.  
  Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{moles} \).  
  Moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles} \).

### Step 2: Neutralization reactions
1. **Reaction between OH⁻ and H⁺ from HCl**:  
   OH⁻ reacts with H⁺ from HCl in a 1:1 ratio.  
   Moles of OH⁻ remaining after neutralizing HCl = \( 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{moles} \).

2. **Reaction between remaining OH⁻ and H⁺ from CH₃COOH**:  
   The remaining OH⁻ reacts with CH₃COOH. Since CH₃COOH has 0.05 moles of H⁺ available, all of it is neutralized, leaving:  
   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = \( 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{moles} \).

### Step 3: Calculate [OH⁻] and pH
The total volume of the solution is:  
\[
500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L}.
\]  
The concentration of OH⁻ in the solution is:  
\[
[\text{OH}^-] = \frac{\text{moles of OH}^-}{\text{volume of solution}} = \frac{0.05}{1.2} \approx 0.0416667 \, \text{M}.
\]  
The pOH is calculated as:  
\[
\text{pOH} = -\log[\text{OH}^-] = -\log(0.0416667) \approx 1.38.
\]  
The pH is then:  
\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH of the solution is **12.62**, which corresponds to **Option A**.  
Answer: A

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not too confident with pH calculations involving multiple solutions. But let's take it step by step. The question is about determining the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. Whew, that's a mouthful. 

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So I think I need to find out how much acid and base there is and then see if there's excess. After that, I can figure out the pH based on what's left.

Let me jot down the given information:

- 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (acetic acid)
- 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (hydrochloric acid)
- 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (barium hydroxide)

Wait, barium hydroxide is a strong base, right? So when it's dissolved in water, it dissociates completely. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and HCl is a strong acid. So when these are mixed, the H+ ions from the acids will react with the OH- ions from the base.

I think the first step is to calculate the moles of each acid and base.

Let's start with the acetic acid. Molarity (M) is moles per liter. So moles = M * volume (in liters).

CH3COOH: 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles.

Ba(OH)2: Hmm, wait. Barium hydroxide is a strong base, so it dissociates into Ba^2+ and OH- ions. Each formula unit gives 2 OH- per formula unit. So for each mole of Ba(OH)2, we get 2 moles of OH-.

So moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. So moles of OH- from this would be 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, but when we mix all these, the H+ from both acids will react with the OH-.

So total H+ from HCl and CH3COOH. Wait, but HCl is a strong acid, so it will completely dissociate, right? So its H+ is 0.08 moles.

But wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid. It doesn't fully dissociate. But when we're mixing it with a strong base, I think the situation might be a bit different. Wait, maybe I should consider all of them as possible contributors of H+.

Wait, but maybe I should first calculate the total moles of H+ from both acids and the total moles of OH- from the base, then see which is in excess.

So total H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles. But wait, what about the acetic acid? Since it's a weak acid, it doesn't fully dissociate, but when mixed with a base, the H+ from the acetic acid would react as well.

Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the total H+ and OH- as if they are all in solution, but considering that only the strong acid (HCl) contributes completely, and weak acid (CH3COOH) doesn't, but in the presence of a base, the weak acid might contribute some H+.

Wait, maybe I should consider all H+ from HCl and the H+ from CH3COOH, but the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react with H+ from both.

Wait, but maybe it's better to first compute the total moles of H+ and OH-.

Wait, but HCl is a strong acid, so it gives 0.08 moles of H+. Acetic acid is a weak acid, which in pure solution would only partially dissociate, but in the presence of a strong base, perhaps the OH- will deprotonate the acetic acid. Hmm, but perhaps the OH- reacts with the H+ from both sources.

Wait, maybe I should model this by considering all the H+ from HCl and the possible H+ from CH3COOH, but the OH- will neutralize some of them.

Alternatively, perhaps I can treat the situation as a neutralization between H+ and OH-. So the H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH, and OH- comes from Ba(OH)2.

So let me compute total H+ and total OH-.

HCl contributes 0.08 moles H+.

CH3COOH is a weak acid, so maybe it contributes some H+ but not as much as HCl. Wait, but when you mix a weak acid with a base, the base (OH-) will deprotonate the weak acid. So the OH- will react with the H+ from CH3COOH first, and then any excess OH- will react with H+ from HCl.

Wait, no. Because OH- is a strong base, it will react with any available H+.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to find the net moles of H+ or OH- after all possible reactions.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate moles of H+ from all acids (HCl and CH3COOH).

Wait, but CH3COOH doesn't dissociate completely, so the H+ from it is less than 0.05 moles. But when mixing with a strong base, the OH- may react with the acetic acid, pulling H+ out of it.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the total H+ as the sum of H+ from all sources, but considering that the OH- will neutralize some.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the total H+ and total OH- in the solution, then find which is in excess.

Wait, but wait: HCl is a strong acid, so it contributes all its H+ (0.08 moles). Acetic acid contributes some H+, but since it's a weak acid, when mixed with a base, perhaps the OH- will take H+ from the acetic acid first. So perhaps the OH- will neutralize some of the H+ from the acetic acid.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of neutralization reactions.

The strong base (Ba(OH)2) will provide OH- ions. The strong acid (HCl) provides H+ ions. The weak acid (CH3COOH) can provide H+ ions, but perhaps in the presence of OH-, it will not contribute as much because OH- will take H+ from it.

So here's a plan:

1. Calculate moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles.

2. Calculate moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 moles.

3. Now, the OH- will react with H+ from all sources, including the weak acid.

But wait, the H+ from the weak acid is not all present initially. In pure solution, CH3COOH only partially dissociates. But when you add a strong base, the OH- will react with any H+ available, including any that the acetic acid can provide.

So perhaps the OH- will first react with the H+ from HCl, then any remaining OH- will react with the H+ from CH3COOH.

Wait, but perhaps we should model this as:

- OH- (0.18 moles) reacts with H+ from HCl (0.08 moles) and any from CH3COOH.

Wait, but the acetic acid's H+ is not all available. So perhaps the OH- will first neutralize the H+ from the HCl, and then the remaining OH- will neutralize the H+ from the acetic acid.

Wait, let me think: HCl is a strong acid, so all 0.08 moles of H+ are available. The OH- is 0.18 moles.

So 0.18 moles of OH- will react with 0.08 moles of H+ from HCl, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH- remaining.

But wait, wait. That's not correct. Because when OH- reacts with H+, it's a 1:1 reaction. So 0.08 moles of H+ will react with 0.08 moles of OH-, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH-.

So then, the remaining 0.10 moles of OH- will react with the H+ from the acetic acid.

But wait, how much H+ does CH3COOH contribute? Since it's a weak acid, in solution, it doesn't fully dissociate. Let's calculate the initial H+ from CH3COOH.

The formula for a weak acid's dissociation is Ka = [H+][A-]/[HA], where Ka for acetic acid is about 1.8 x 10^-5.

But when you add a strong base, the OH- will deprotonate the acetic acid. So the initial moles of CH3COOH is 0.05 moles.

So the OH- will take H+ from CH3COOH, which is a weak acid. So each mole of OH- will take one mole of H+ from CH3COOH, converting it into CH3COO^-.

But how much OH- is left after neutralizing HCl? 0.10 moles.

So let's see, after the OH- reacts with HCl's H+, there's 0.10 moles of OH- left. That OH- will react with the CH3COOH.

Each mole of OH- will take one mole of CH3COOH and produce one mole of CH3COO^- and one mole of water.

So 0.10 moles of OH- will react with 0.10 moles of CH3COOH, converting it into CH3COO^-.

So the remaining CH3COOH is 0.05 - 0.10 = negative. Wait, that's not possible. So the amount of OH- (0.10 moles) is more than the available CH3COOH (0.05 moles). So all the CH3COOH will be neutralized, and the excess OH- will be 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles.

So now, after all reactions, the solution will have:

- From HCl: all H+ neutralized, so nothing left.

- From CH3COOH: all 0.05 moles converted to CH3COO^-.

- Excess OH-: 0.05 moles.

Wait, but wait. Let me recap:

Total H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles.

Total OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 moles.

Reaction 1: H+ (0.08) + OH- (0.08) → H2O. Remaining OH-: 0.10.

Reaction 2: OH- (0.10) + CH3COOH (0.05) → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So, after this, all 0.05 moles of CH3COOH are neutralized, and there's 0.05 moles of OH- remaining.

So the total solution volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So the concentration of OH- is 0.05 moles / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0416667 M.

Then, pOH = -log(0.0416667) ≈ 1.38.

So pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

Wait, but wait a second. Because after the reactions, the solution has excess OH-, so it's basic. So the pH would be 12.62, which is option A.

But wait, did I account for everything correctly? Let me double-check the steps.

1. Moles of HCl: 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08, correct.

2. Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.18 moles, correct.

3. OH- reacts with H+ from HCl: 0.08 H+ neutralized by 0.08 OH-, leaving 0.10 OH-.

4. Remaining OH- (0.10) reacts with CH3COOH (0.05). But wait, CH3COOH only has 0.05 moles. So 0.05 moles of OH- are consumed, leaving 0.05 moles of OH-.

So total OH- after all reactions is 0.05 moles.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18. First, it neutralizes HCl's H+ (0.08), leaving 0.10 moles of OH-. Then, this 0.10 moles of OH- reacts with CH3COOH. But CH3COOH has 0.05 moles. So 0.05 moles of OH- will neutralize the H+ from CH3COOH, leaving 0.05 moles of OH-.

Wait no, because each mole of OH- can neutralize one mole of H+ from CH3COOH. But CH3COOH only has 0.05 moles of H+ available (since it's a weak acid, but in the presence of a strong base, it will fully deprotonate). So here, the OH- would take H+ from CH3COOH until either the OH- is used up or the CH3COOH is all neutralized.

So after reacting with HCl's H+, the OH- is 0.10. Then, reacting with CH3COOH (0.05 moles), all of the CH3COOH's H+ is neutralized, and 0.05 moles of OH- are consumed, leaving 0.05 moles of OH-.

So yes, that part is correct.

So total OH- is 0.05 moles in 1.2 L.

Concentration [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0416667 M.

pOH = -log(0.0416667) ≈ 1.38.

pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

So the pH is about 12.62, which is option A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 12.62, which matches this. But wait, wait a minute. Let me think again because I'm a bit confused about whether I should consider the H+ from CH3COOH beyond what's neutralized by OH-.

Wait, no, because when OH- is present, it will take H+ from any available source. So in this case, the OH- first neutralizes the strong acid HCl, then the weak acid CH3COOH, and any excess OH- will make the solution basic.

So the OH- in excess is 0.05 moles, which makes the solution basic, so pH is 12.62.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the total H+ and OH-.

Total H+ from HCl: 0.08.

Total H+ from CH3COOH: Let's compute it as if it were a weak acid in solution.

But perhaps that's complicating it. Because when you mix with a strong base, the OH- will take H+ from the weak acid as well, effectively neutralizing it. So perhaps the correct approach is the one I took earlier.

Wait, but what if the OH- is less than the H+ from HCl plus CH3COOH? Then the solution would be acidic. But in this case, since the OH- is 0.18, which is more than the H+ from HCl (0.08) plus CH3COOH's potential H+ (up to 0.05), the remaining OH- would be 0.18 - 0.08 - 0.05 = 0.05, which is what I calculated.

Wait, but wait. The CH3COOH can only contribute up to 0.05 moles of H+ because that's all it has. So, combining all, the total OH- is 0.18. It neutralizes 0.08 H+ from HCl and 0.05 H+ from CH3COOH, leaving 0.05 moles of OH-.

Thus, the solution is basic, so pH is 14 - pOH.

Calculating pOH:

pOH = log (0.05 / 1.2) ?

Wait, no. [OH-] is 0.05 moles in 1.2 L. So [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0416667 M.

pOH = -log(0.0416667) ≈ 1.38.

So pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62, which is option A.

Wait, but what about the other ions in solution? Like, does the presence of Ba^2+ or other ions affect the pH? Probably not, because they are spectator ions.

So yes, the final answer should be A) 12.62.


To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the mixing of 500 mL of 0.1 M CH₃COOH (acetic acid), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (hydrochloric acid), and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)₂ (barium hydroxide). The key steps are as follows:

### Step 1: Calculate moles of H⁺ and OH⁻
- **H⁺ from HCl**:  
  HCl is a strong acid, so it fully dissociates.  
  Moles of H⁺ = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{moles} \).

- **H⁺ from CH₃COOH**:  
  CH₃COOH is a weak acid and does not fully dissociate. However, in the presence of a strong base, the OH⁻ ions will neutralize the H⁺ ions from CH₃COOH.  
  Moles of CH₃COOH = \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{moles} \).

- **OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂**:  
  Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base and fully dissociates. Each formula unit provides 2 OH⁻ ions.  
  Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{moles} \).  
  Moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles} \).

### Step 2: Neutralization reactions
1. **Reaction between OH⁻ and H⁺ from HCl**:  
   OH⁻ reacts with H⁺ from HCl in a 1:1 ratio.  
   Moles of OH⁻ remaining after neutralizing HCl = \( 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{moles} \).

2. **Reaction between remaining OH⁻ and H⁺ from CH₃COOH**:  
   The remaining OH⁻ reacts with CH₃COOH. Since CH₃COOH has 0.05 moles of H⁺ available, all of it is neutralized, leaving:  
   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = \( 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{moles} \).

### Step 3: Calculate [OH⁻] and pH
The total volume of the solution is:  
\[
500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L}.
\]  
The concentration of OH⁻ in the solution is:  
\[
[\text{OH}^-] = \frac{\text{moles of OH}^-}{\text{volume of solution}} = \frac{0.05}{1.2} \approx 0.0416667 \, \text{M}.
\]  
The pOH is calculated as:  
\[
\text{pOH} = -\log[\text{OH}^-] = -\log(0.0416667) \approx 1.38.
\]  
The pH is then:  
\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH of the solution is **12.62**, which corresponds to **Option A**.
