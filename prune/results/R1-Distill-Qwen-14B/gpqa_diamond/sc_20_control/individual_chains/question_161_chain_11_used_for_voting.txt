Okay, so I've got this question about transmission electron microscopes and the mean free path of gas molecules. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to think it through.

So, the scenario is that Mike is working on a high-resolution TEM operating at 1000 kV. He uses vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, less than 10^-9 Torr, which is really low pressure. The idea is to minimize gas molecules in the sample compartment because they can interfere with the electron beam. But despite that, some gas particles are still present, and the mass spectrometer detects them.

Mike measured the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, right? The factors that affect it are things like pressure, temperature, and the size of the compartment. Oh wait, the formula for mean free path is λ = (k*T) / (sqrt(2)*π*d^2*p), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the molecular diameter, and p is pressure. So, lower pressure (p) would mean a longer mean free path, because the molecules don't collide as often.

But then, when Mike starts the electron beam, he notices that the mean free path changes to λ2. The temperature remains the same, so T isn't changing. What else could affect the mean free path? Oh, the electron beam itself might interact with the gas molecules.

I remember that when charged particles like electrons pass through a medium, they can cause various effects. One of them is ionization. The electrons might knock electrons off the gas molecules, creating ions. These ions have a charge, so they could move in the electric field of the microscope. Also, the electron beam has a high energy, so it might cause more collisions or alter the gas's behavior.

Wait, but how does this affect the mean free path? Well, when the gas is neutral, the mean free path is determined by collisions between gas molecules. But if the gas is ionized, those ions might interact differently. Alternatively, the electron beam could cause the gas to change its state or affect its density.

Another thought: the presence of the electron beam introduces additional forces. The beam has a certain current and maybe a magnetic field. The ions created could be accelerated or deflected. Or perhaps the beam's electric field affects the gas particles, causing them to move more, which could influence the mean free path.

Wait, when the gas is ionized, the mean free path might increase because the ions have a longer path before they're scattered. Or is it the opposite? Let me think. Neutral gas molecules have certain cross-sections for scattering electrons. If the gas becomes ionized, the effective cross-sectional area might change. For example, ions have a larger cross-section because their charge increases the probability of scattering electrons.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam creates more ionization, which leads to more charged particles. These charged particles (ions and electrons) could experience the electric fields in the microscope and perhaps be accelerated or moved away. This would reduce their density in the sample compartment because some are being removed by the beam's effects. If the density decreases, the pressure effectively goes down, so the mean free path would increase.

Wait, because mean free path λ is inversely proportional to pressure p. So if p decreases, λ increases. So if the electron beam causes some of the gas molecules to be removed (either by pushing them away or causing them to leave), the effective pressure in the compartment would decrease. That would make λ2 larger than λ1.

Wait, but initially, before the beam, the mean free path was λ1. Then when the beam is on, the pressure might effectively decrease, so λ2 would be longer than λ1. So λ2 > λ1. But wait, looking at the options, option C says λ2 < λ1. That would imply that the mean free path is shorter when the beam is on. That doesn't seem to fit with what I was thinking.

Wait, maybe I'm getting it wrong. Let me think again. When the electron beam is on, it's possible that the gas molecules are being excited or ionized, leading to more frequent interactions. Alternatively, the ions created could influence each other more, leading to more collisions.

Wait, another angle: Mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. If the electron beam causes the gas to ionize, does that change the collision rate? If the gas is ionized, perhaps the ions have different cross-sections for collisions with each other and with the beam electrons. But in this scenario, the gas particles are the main concern for scattering the electron beam.

Wait, but the issue here is about the electron beam scattering by gas molecules. So when Mike starts the beam, he notices that the mean free path (from the electron's perspective) changes. So perhaps the beam's presence affects the gas molecules, making their mean free path longer or shorter.

Alternatively, the presence of the electron beam might cause the gas to become more ionized. Since ions have a higher charge, they might interact more with the electrons in the beam, leading to more scattering events. That would increase the scattering rate, which would decrease the mean free path (because the electrons are hitting more gas particles sooner). So λ2 would be shorter than λ1.

Wait, but if the beam is causing more ionization, perhaps the ions are accelerated away from the beam path by the electric fields. That would reduce the number of gas particles (ions) in the path of the beam. So, the density of scattering particles in the beam's path would decrease, leading to a longer mean free path. So λ2 would be larger than λ1.

Hmm, conflicting thoughts here. Let me try to structure this.

Factors affecting mean free path (λ):

1. Pressure (p): λ is inversely proportional to p. Lower p → longer λ.

2. Temperature (T): Higher T → longer λ, because molecules move faster, so collisions are less frequent.

3. Molecular diameter (d): Larger d → shorter λ.

In this case, temperature is the same, so T is fixed. The initial λ1 is under vacuum conditions, but some gas remains.

When the electron beam is turned on, what changes? The beam has a high energy (1000 kV), which is 1e6 eV. That's a lot of energy. The beam electrons have a high velocity, so they can ionize gas molecules they collide with.

So, when the beam is on, the gas molecules in the beam path are more likely to be ionized. Once ionized, these charged particles (ions) might experience the electric fields in the microscope differently. For example, the ions could be accelerated or deflected away from the sample compartment.

Alternatively, the ions might stick to the walls or other parts of the microscope, effectively removing them from the compartment. So the number of gas molecules (density) in the compartment could decrease due to the beam-induced effects.

If the density decreases, then the pressure p decreases. Since λ is inversely proportional to p, λ would increase. So λ2 would be greater than λ1. So λ2 > λ1.

Looking at the options, option A says λ2 >= 1.22*λ1. Option C is λ2 < λ1, which would not be the case if pressure decreases.

But wait, perhaps the ionization process increases the effective cross-section of the gas particles. Because an ion has a higher charge, the cross-section for scattering electrons might be larger. So even if the density is lower, the increased cross-section could lead to the same or lower mean free path.

Hmm, that's a possibility. So if the density decreases (lower p) but the cross-section increases, which effect dominates?

The mean free path equation is λ = (k*T) / (sqrt(2)*π*d^2*p). But wait, the cross-section σ is π*d^2, but when considering charged particles, the cross-section could be different. Or perhaps the mean free path equation is more accurately given by λ = 1/(n*σ), where n is the number density and σ is the collision cross-section.

So if the beam causes the gas to ionize, the cross-section σ for electron scattering might increase. Even if the number density n decreases, if σ increases enough, the product n*σ could stay the same, or even increase, leading to a smaller λ.

Wait, so which effect is more significant? Let's say the beam causes some of the gas to ionize, which could lead to either an increase or decrease in n (number density) and an increase in σ.

If after ionization, the number density n decreases (because some ions are removed from the compartment) but σ increases, it's unclear which effect would dominate. It depends on how much each changes.

But wait, the initial λ1 is determined under the same conditions, but without the electron beam. So the initial λ1 is based on the gas being neutral. When the beam is on, the gas in the path becomes ionized. Let's assume that the ionization leads to more efficient scattering of the electrons.

So, σ_beam = σ_ion, which is larger than σ_neutral. And the number density in the beam path could be lower because some ions are lost. Let's model this.

Suppose in the absence of the beam, the number density is n1. When the beam is on, some of the gas is ionized and then removed (say, n2 < n1). The cross-section for scattering is σ2 > σ1. So the product n2*σ2 could be larger than n1*σ1, meaning 1/(n2*σ2) < 1/(n1*σ1), so λ2 < λ1.

But wait, the initial λ1 is based on the gas being neutral. So when the beam is on, the gas is ionized in the beam's path. The effect is that, in the beam's presence, the effective n (number of scattering particles) might be lower because some are removed, but the cross-sections are higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the beam creates a local increase in temperature or pressure, but the question says the temperature remains the same.

This is getting a bit complicated. Let me think about the possible effects again.

Option C says λ2 < λ1, which would mean the mean free path is shorter when the beam is on. So, the electrons are scattering more, so their mean free path is shorter.

Alternatively, if the beam causes the gas to be removed, the mean free path might be longer. But how does that tie into the effect on the electron beam?

Wait, the question is about the mean free path of the gas molecules. But when the electron beam is on, it's the electrons that are moving, not the gas. Or is the question about the mean free path of the electrons as they travel through the gas?

Wait, reading the question again: "mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules." So Mike observes that the mean free path (of the electrons, I think) is now λ2, not λ1.

Wait, wait. The question says, "the mean free path was no longer equal to λ1; rather, it was λ2, even though the sample compartment temperature remained the same."

Wait, the mean free path of the gas molecules or the electrons? The wording is a bit ambiguous. The first part says Mike determined the mean free path of the gas molecules to be λ1. Then, when initiating the electron beam, he found that the mean free path (but whose?) was λ2.

Ah, the question says, "mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules." So, perhaps λ2 is the mean free path of the electrons in the presence of the gas. Because the electron beam's mean free path would be determined by how often they scatter off the gas molecules.

Wait, that makes sense. So originally, Mike calculated λ1 as the mean free path of the gas molecules. But when the electron beam is on, the electrons have their own mean free path, which is λ2. So λ1 is the gas's mean free path, and λ2 is the electron's mean free path.

Wait, but that's a bit confusing. Let me clarify: The mean free path of the gas molecules is how far they go between collisions. The mean free path of the electrons would be how far they go between scattering off the gas molecules.

In that case, the electron's mean free path depends on the density of the gas and the scattering cross-section. So if the gas is ionized, the scattering properties change.

But wait, the initial λ1 is the mean free path of the gas molecules. When the beam is on, the electrons' mean free path is λ2, which is shorter or longer than λ1?

If the gas is ionized, perhaps the electrons are more likely to scatter, so λ2 would be shorter. Because the electrons are more likely to hit the gas particles, making the mean free path shorter.

Alternatively, if the ionization leads to the gas molecules being removed (like being pumped away), then the density of gas decreases, which would mean higher mean free path for the electrons.

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me think about how the mean free path for electrons is calculated. The electron mean free path λ_e is given by λ_e = 1/(n * σ_e), where n is the number density of scattering centers, and σ_e is the scattering cross-section for electrons.

When the gas is neutral, the cross-section σ_e is for electrons scattering off neutral gas molecules. Once the gas is ionized, the cross-section for scattering could be different. For example, ions have a higher charge and may have a larger cross-section for electron scattering. So σ_e increases.

At the same time, if the ionization leads to the gas being pumped away (due to the electric fields in the microscope), the number density n could decrease.

So the product n*σ_e could go up, down, or stay the same. It depends on the relative changes in n and σ_e.

But in the scenario, Mike observes a change in the mean free path. If the main effect is that the electron's mean free path is shorter, then λ2 < λ1.

Wait, but λ1 was the gas's mean free path, and λ2 is the electron's mean free path. Are they directly comparable?

Alternatively, perhaps Mike is observing the electron's mean free path as λ2, and he's comparing it to the gas's mean free path λ1. But I'm not sure how that would work.

Wait, actually, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The question states that the mean free path of the gas molecules was λ1, and upon starting the beam, the mean free path became λ2. That suggests that λ2 is the mean free path of the gas molecules, not the electrons.

Wait, but if the gas is ionized, does that change their mean free path? Because the mean free path is about how far they move before colliding with another gas molecule. If the gas is ionized, the ions could interact more with the ions of the same charge, leading perhaps to more frequent collisions. Or maybe they're accelerated away, leading to less frequent collisions.

Wait, but if the ions are accelerated out of the compartment, the number density n decreases, leading to longer mean free path. So λ2 would be longer than λ1.

But the question says that Mike found λ2, which is the mean free path of the gas molecules, to be different. So if the beam causes the gas to be ionized and then pumped out, the number density n decreases, so mean free path λ = 1/(n σ) increases. So λ2 > λ1.

Looking at the options, option A says λ2 >= 1.22 λ1, option D is λ1 < λ2 <1.22λ1, option C is λ2 < λ1.

If λ2 is larger than λ1, then the correct options are A or D.

But why would the mean free path of the gas molecules change when the electron beam is on? Because the gas is being ionized and possibly removed, which reduces the density.

Wait, but the mean free path λ1 was calculated under the same conditions, but without the beam. So the presence of the beam might cause the gas to ionize, leading to a lower density, hence longer λ2. So λ2 would be greater than λ1.

But the options don't have λ2 > λ1 as a possible conclusion except for A and D. Option A says λ2 is >= 1.22 λ1, which is a significant increase. D says it's between λ1 and 1.22 λ1.

Wait, why 1.22? That's the factor for the root mean square velocity or something else? Oh wait, the mean free path formula involves sqrt(T), so if temperature increases, λ increases. But the question states the temperature remains the same.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the formula. The formula for mean free path is λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2)*π*d²*p), where p is pressure. Alternatively, it can be written as λ = (v_avg)/(sqrt(2) π d n), where v_avg is the average velocity, n is number density. Since v_avg is sqrt(3kT/(m)), so substituting, λ is proportional to sqrt(T)/(n p) or something like that.

But temperature is constant. So if p decreases, λ increases.

So in the scenario, when the electron beam is on, the pressure p effectively decreases because some gas is ionized and pumped away, so λ2 is larger than λ1.

So the conclusion is that λ2 > λ1.

Looking at the options, option A says λ2 >= 1.22 λ1. But how would we know if it's more or just a bit larger?

Wait, perhaps the effect is that the gas is ionized, which changes the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes the gas to become more dense in the beam path. Wait, that seems unlikely because the electron beam is a focused beam, but the gas is spread throughout the compartment.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam causes more gas molecules to be in the beam path, increasing the scattering. But that would lower λ2, which contradicts previous reasoning.

Wait, perhaps the mean free path of the gas is measured based on how much gas is present and their movement. If the electron beam causes some gas to be ionized and then expelled from the compartment, the effective number of gas molecules (n) decreases, meaning p decreases, so λ increases.

So Mike's observation is that λ2 is larger than λ1. But the options given don't have an option where λ2 > λ1 except A and D. But the question asks what we can conclude about λ2.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes the gas to be more ionized, which increases the effective cross-section. So the mean free path for the gas molecules would be shorter because they collide more often due to their increased charge.

Wait, but if the gas molecules have higher charge, their cross-section for collisions with each other increases. So d² (the collision diameter in the formula) effectively increases. So with d² larger, λ becomes smaller.

So λ2 = (k*T)/(sqrt(2) π d2² p). If d2² > d1² (because ionized), but p is same, then λ2 < λ1.

Wait, but when the electron beam is on, the pressure p might change because some gas is pumped away. So d could increase (because ionized) and p could decrease.

Thus, two opposing effects: d^2 increases, which lowers λ, but p decreases, which increases λ.

Which effect is stronger? It depends on how much each changes. If the decrease in p outweighs the increase in d², λ could increase. If the increase in d² is more significant, λ could decrease.

But without specific numbers, it's hard to say. The question says that Mike observed that the mean free path was no longer λ1. So based on the scenario, the main effect is perhaps the change in cross-section due to ionization.

If the gas is ionized, their cross-section for collision increases, leading to a shorter mean free path. So λ2 < λ1.

So the correct answer would be option C: λ2 < λ1.

But wait, this contradicts my earlier thought that the number density might decrease, leading to longer λ. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ionization doesn't change the gas's mean free path much because the pressure is already ultra-high. The initial mean free path λ1 is very large, as the pressure is low. If the mean free path of the gas molecules is much larger than the compartment, then the presence of the electron beam might not significantly change it. But Mike did observe a change, so the effect must be noticeable.

Alternatively, perhaps when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules in the beam path are ionized and either repelled or accelerated, which reduces their number in the beam's vicinity. So the effective number density in the beam path decreases, leading to a longer mean free path for the electrons. But wait, the question is about the gas's mean free path.

Alternatively, perhaps when the electron beam is on, the gas is ionized, and the ions are more likely to collide with each other because of their charge, thus increasing the collision rate. So λ2 would be shorter than λ1.

So, putting it all together, I think the correct conclusion is that λ2 is less than λ1, so option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves understanding the mean free path (λ) of gas molecules in a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM) operating under ultra-high vacuum conditions. Initially, Mike determines the mean free path of the gas molecules to be λ1. However, upon initiating the electron beam, he observes a change in the mean free path to λ2. The task is to determine the relationship between λ2 and λ1 based on the given scenario.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Mean Free Path Formula**:  
   The mean free path of gas molecules is given by:  
   \[
   \lambda = \frac{kT}{\sqrt{2} \pi d^2 p}
   \]  
   where \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, \(T\) is the temperature, \(d\) is the molecular diameter, and \(p\) is the pressure. Since the temperature remains constant, changes in \(\lambda\) depend on changes in \(d^2\) (collision cross-section) and \(p\) (pressure).

2. **Initial Conditions (λ1)**:  
   Before the electron beam is turned on, the gas molecules are neutral, and the mean free path is determined by the ultra-high vacuum conditions. The pressure \(p\) is very low, resulting in a large λ1.

3. **Effect of the Electron Beam (λ2)**:  
   When the electron beam is activated, it interacts with the gas molecules, causing ionization. Ionized gas molecules (ions) have a larger effective cross-section (\(d^2\)) due to their charge, which increases the likelihood of collisions between gas molecules. This effect would decrease the mean free path (\(\lambda\)).

   Additionally, the electron beam may remove some ionized gas molecules from the sample compartment (e.g., via pumping or deflection by electric fields), reducing the effective number density (\(n\)) of gas molecules. A lower \(n\) would increase the mean free path (\(\lambda\)).

4. **Balancing Effects**:  
   The two competing effects are:  
   - **Increase in \(d^2\)** (due to ionization), which decreases \(\lambda\).  
   - **Decrease in \(n\)** (due to removal of ions), which increases \(\lambda\).  

   The question specifies that Mike observed a change in the mean free path, implying that the ionization effect dominates. The increased cross-section due to ionization leads to a shorter mean free path (\(\lambda_2 < \lambda_1\)).

5. **Evaluation of Options**:  
   - **Option A (\(\lambda_2 \geq 1.22 \lambda_1\))**: This implies a significant increase in the mean free path, which is inconsistent with the ionization effect.  
   - **Option B (\(\lambda_2 = \lambda_1\))**: This suggests no change in the mean free path, which contradicts Mike's observation.  
   - **Option C (\(\lambda_2 < \lambda_1\))**: This aligns with the ionization effect, where the increased cross-section reduces the mean free path.  
   - **Option D (\(\lambda_1 < \lambda_2 < 1.22 \lambda_1\))**: This implies a moderate increase in the mean free path, which is inconsistent with the dominant ionization effect.

### Conclusion:
The ionization of gas molecules by the electron beam increases their effective cross-section, leading to a shorter mean free path (\(\lambda_2 < \lambda_1\)). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
