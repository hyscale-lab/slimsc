Okay, so I've got this question about enamine reactions, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Enamines are compounds formed from a secondary amine and a carbonyl compound, right? They're useful in organic synthesis because they can undergo various reactions, especially in forming rings or adding substituents.

The question gives me a starting material: (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. Hmm, that name is a bit complex. Let me break it down. The base structure is an ethanaminium, which I think is an ethylamine with a positive charge, perhaps as an ammonium ion. The substituents are N-methyl and pentan-2-ylidene. The (E) configuration suggests that the substituents are trans around the double bond.

Wait, pentan-2-ylidene would be a group like CH2-CH2-C=CH2? No, wait, pentan-2-ylidene is a substituent attached to a double bond. The structure would be CH2CH2-C=CH2? No, wait, maybe it's more like CH2CH2-C=CH2 but as a substituent on the amine. So the starting material is an enamine, I think.

The reaction is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium + reagent A → product B.

The options are about what reagent A is and what B is. The options give different sequences of reagents, and different products.

I remember that enamine reactions typically involve the amine's conjugate acid (the enamine) reacting with an electrophile. The general steps are: form the enamine, deprotonate it to make it more nucleophilic, add an electrophile, and then hydrolyze to get the amine and ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material is already an enamine. So when enamine reacts, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of alkylation. Because enamines can undergo alkylation at the alpha position (the position adjacent to the nitrogen) because the double bond makes it more electron-rich.

So, the reaction steps for an enamine might be: first, deprotonation to form a strong base. Then, alkylation with an alkyl halide. Finally, acid workup to protonate and hydrolyze.

Looking at the options, the reagents involve LDA (a strong base, which is lithium diisopropylamide), DME as a solvent, and then something like CH3CH2I (ethyl iodide), followed by H3O+ (acid workup).

Option A: (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+. Product is pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine.

Wait, but I thought the product would be a ketone formed after hydrolysis. Let me think about the reaction.

Enamine structure: the starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. That's the structure of an enamine. So when the enamine reacts, it can undergo alkylation.

So, in the presence of a strong base like LDA, the enamine would deprotonate, making the alpha position more nucleophilic. Then, an alkyl iodide like ethyl iodide would react, adding an ethyl group to the alpha position.

After that, acid workup (H3O+) would hydrolyze the enamine back to the ketone and the secondary amine.

Wait, but what's the structure before and after?

The starting enamine is derived from a ketone and a secondary amine. Let's say the amine is N-methyl ethanamine (since the product after hydrolysis is N,N-dimethylethanamine, which is CH32NHCH2CH3. Wait, no, N,N-dimethylethanamine is (CH3)2NCH2CH3, but that's a primary amine. Wait, no: ethanamine is CH3CH2NH2. If it's dimethyl, it's (CH3)2NHCH2CH3? No, wait, wait. N,N-dimethylethanamine would have the structure CH3CH2N(CH3)2, but wait, that would be a quaternary ammonium salt. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, the product after hydrolysis would be a ketone and a secondary amine. So the enamine is formed by a secondary amine and a ketone. So when you hydrolyze the enamine, you get back the original amine and the ketone.

So in this case, the enamine is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So the amine part is N-methyl ethanaminium. The ketone part is pentan-2-one, perhaps?

Wait, no. Wait, the enamine structure is R2C=CH-NR’2+. So the starting material here is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium.

Let me draw the structure. The main chain is CH2-CH2-C=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, pentan-2-ylidene is CH2CH2-C=CH2? No, pentan-2-ylidene would be CH2CH2-C=CH2, but that can't be right. Oh wait, pentan-2-ylidene is CH2CH2-C=CH-CH2. Wait, no, it's probably CH2-CH2-C=CH2. Hmm, perhaps it's CH2CH2-C=CH-CH2CH3? No, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the enamine is derived from pentan-2-one and a secondary amine. So, pentan-2-one is (CH2)2CO, which when reacted with a secondary amine would form the enamine. The amine is N-methyl ethanamine, which is (CH3)2NHCH2CH3? Wait, no: ethanaminium would be CH3CH2NH+.

Wait, perhaps the starting enamine is (E)-configured, meaning that the substituents on either side of the double bond are trans.

So, after deprotonation (using LDA, a strong base), the enamine becomes more nucleophilic. Then, it reacts with ethyl iodide (CH3CH2I), which is an alkylating agent. The ethyl group adds to the alpha position—the carbon adjacent to the nitrogen.

After that, acid workup hydrolyzes the enamine back into the ketone and the amine.

Wait, but the starting enamine is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So when we deprotonate, we get an enamine anion, which attacks the ethyl iodide. The ethyl group adds to the alpha carbon, making it a larger molecule. Then, upon hydrolysis, this would form a new ketone.

Wait, but the product B is supposed to be either pentan-2-one or heptan-4-one, depending on the option.

Let me think. The original enamine comes from a ketone and a secondary amine. Let's say the ketone is pentan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO). The secondary amine is N-methyl ethanamine, which is (CH3)2NCH2CH3. Wait, no, the amine is probably (CH3)2NHR, where R is the part from the enamine.

Wait, maybe the enamine is formed from pentan-2-one and N-methyl ethanamine. So when the enamine is hydrolyzed, it gives back pentan-2-one and the amine, which is N-methyl ethanamine.

But wait, if the enamine undergoes alkylation, adding an ethyl group, then upon hydrolysis, the ketone would be larger.

Let me model this. The enamine has a structure like R2C=CH-NR'R''. So when the alpha carbon (the one adjacent to N) is alkylated, it adds a group there. Hydrolysis would break the enamine into a ketone.

So for the starting enamine, the R groups are from the ketone and the amine.

Suppose the starting enamine is from pentan-2-one and a secondary amine, say, N-methyl ethanamine. The enamine is (E)-configured.

When you deprotonate with LDA, you get a strong base. Then, adding ethyl iodide would lead to alkylation at the alpha position. So the alpha carbon (which was part of the ketone) now has an ethyl group.

So the structure after alkylation would have an ethyl group added to the alpha position. Then, when hydrolyzed, that would form a ketone with one more carbon than before?

Wait, no. Let me think about the example. Suppose the enamine is formed from acetone (propan-2-one) and a secondary amine. Alkylation would add a group to the alpha position, making it a larger ketone upon hydrolysis.

So, if I have an enamine from pentan-2-one and an amine, and I add an ethyl group, perhaps the ketone becomes heptan-4-one?

Wait, let me count. Pentan-2-one is (CH2)2CO. If you add two carbons (ethyl) to the alpha position, that would make a longer chain. But wait, adding ethyl would add two carbons, but where?

Alternatively, perhaps the enamine is from pentan-2-one and a secondary amine. So the enamine would have the structure (CH2)2CO → (CH2)2C=CH-NR'R''.

When alkylation occurs, the CH2 becomes CH2CH2. So after adding ethyl, the alpha carbon is now CH2CH2. Upon hydrolysis, this would form a ketone. Let's see: the original structure is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium.

After alkylation, the structure would have an ethyl group added to the alpha position. So the enamine after alkylation would have an extended chain. Upon hydrolysis, the ketone would be pentan-2-one plus two carbons? Or maybe the position shifts.

Wait, maybe I should think about this more clearly. The starting enamine has a structure where the double bond is between C2 and C3 of pentane. So, the enamine is derived from pentan-2-one.

Let me draw the enamine structure as follows: The main chain is CH2-CH2-C(=N)-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, perhaps it's more like CH2CH2-C=CH-NR'R''.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the enamine as:

R2C=CH-NR'R''

Where R2C is from the ketone, R' and R'' are from the amine.

So, if the original ketone is pentan-2-one, which is (CH2)2CO. The enamine will have R2C as (CH2)2C-.

So, the enamine would look like (CH2)2C=CH-NR'R''.

Upon alkylation, the alpha carbon (the one adjacent to N) is where the ethyl group is added.

So, when the enamine is deprotonated, the alpha carbon becomes more nucleophilic. It attacks the ethyl iodide, adding an ethyl group there.

So, the structure after alkylation would be (CH2)2C=CH-CH2CH2-NR'R''.

Wait, no, perhaps it's CH2-CH2-C=CH-CH2CH2-NR'R''.

Wait, no, perhaps the alkylation occurs on the carbon adjacent to the N. So, in the enamine, the structure is CH2-CH2-C=CH-NR'R''.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more accurately represented as:

(CH2)2-C=CH-N(CH3)(R''), where R'' is another substituent from the amine.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about hydrolysis. The enamine, after alkylation, undergoes hydrolysis to form a ketone and the corresponding amine.

So, if the enamine was from pentan-2-one and an amine, adding an ethyl group via alkylation would result in a new ketone which is heptan-4-one.

Wait, let me count: original ketone is pentan-2-one (5 carbons). Adding an ethyl group would make it 5 + 2 =7 carbons. But where is the ketone group positioned?

In the enamine, the double bond is between C2 and C3 (from pentan-2-one). Alkylation adds a group to C3, perhaps. Upon hydrolysis, the ketone would be in the middle of the chain.

Wait, perhaps the original enamine is:

CH2CH2-C=CH-NR'R''.

After alkylation, maybe it's CH2CH2-C=CH-CH2CH3-NR'R''.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think about the positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkylation adds to the alpha position, which is the carbon adjacent to the N. So the enamine's structure is:

R2C=CH-NR'R''.

So R2C is from the ketone. Let's say R2 is (CH2)2. Then, R is from the amine.

After alkylation, the structure becomes R2C=CH-CH2CH3-NR'R''.

Wait, no, the attack is on the alpha position (the CH2 next to N). So, the enamine after alkylation would have an ethyl group added to that position.

So when you hydrolyze, you break the N-C bond, and the carbonyl is formed. So the new ketone would be (CH2)2-C-O-CH2CH3?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's think of a concrete example.

Suppose the enamine is derived from pentan-2-one and dimethylamine. The enamine would be (CH2CH2)C=CH-N(CH3)2.

Wait, that's not right. Wait, the enamine has the structure R2C=CH-NR'R''. So if the original ketone is pentan-2-one ( (CH2)2CO ), then R2C would be (CH2)2C-. So the enamine is (CH2)2C=CH-NR'R''.

Then, if an ethyl group is added via alkylation, it would attach to the alpha carbon (the CH in the CH-NR'R'' part). Wait, no, the alpha carbon is the one adjacent to the N. So the enamine is R2C=CH-NR'R''. The alpha carbon is the CH, which is next to the N.

So when we deprotonate, the alpha carbon becomes more nucleophilic. Then, the ethyl iodide would add an ethyl group to that carbon.

So the structure after alkylation would be R2C=CH-CH2CH2-NR'R''.

Wait, but that would make the structure R2C=CH-CH2CH2-NR'R''.

Wait, but that's not correct because the double bond is between C and CH, so adding an ethyl would have to be on the same carbon.

Hmm, perhaps I should draw it. The enamine structure is:

(CH2)2C=CH-NR'R''.

After deprotonating, the CH becomes a carbanion, which then attacks CH3CH2I, adding the ethyl group to that carbon.

So the structure becomes (CH2)2C=CH(CH2CH3)-NR'R''.

Wait, but that can't be right because the double bond is between C and CH, adding an ethyl to the CH would make it CH2CH2, which would disrupt the double bond.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Maybe the enamine is (CH2CH2)–C=CH–NR'R''.

So the alpha position is the CH. Adding an ethyl group to that CH would give CH2CH2–C=CH(CH2CH3)–NR'R''.

But that would make the CH2CH3 attached to the same carbon as the double bond, which might not be possible. Alternatively, perhaps the double bond shifts.

Wait, perhaps the alkylation occurs at the alpha carbon, leading to the formation of a new structure, which upon hydrolysis gives a ketone.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the product. The options indicate that product B is either pentan-2-one or heptan-4-one.

If the starting material is an enamine derived from pentan-2-one, and after alkylation, the product is heptan-4-one, that makes sense. Because adding an ethyl group would increase the chain length by two.

Wait, but wait. Let's think: the starting ketone is pentan-2-one (5 carbons). If the enamine undergoes alkylation, adding an ethyl group (2 carbons), the product would be a ketone with 5 + 2 =7 carbons. But where is the ketone group?

If the original was pentan-2-one, the new ketone would be heptan-4-one. Because the ethyl is added to the alpha position, which is next to the carbonyl in the original ketone.

Wait, but in the enamine, the position is different. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the product is heptan-4-one. Let me see: 4 is the position of the ketone in a 7-carbon chain. Pentan-2-one is 5 carbons with the ketone at position 2.

If you add two carbons (ethyl group) to the alpha position (position 3 in pentan-2-one), the new chain would be longer. Let's count: pentan-2-one is (CH3)2CO.

After adding ethyl to position 3, the structure becomes CH2CH2CO-CH2CH2-... Hmm, maybe I'm not getting this right.

Wait, perhaps the product is heptan-4-one. Heptan-4-one is (CH2)3CO(CH2)2CH3. So, the chain has seven carbons with the ketone in the middle.

Wait, if the starting ketone is pentan-2-one (5 carbons, ketone at C2), and the enamine forms, then alkylation adds two carbons (from ethyl), making the chain 5 + 2 =7 carbons. The ketone's position would be in the middle, which would be heptan-4-one.

So the product after hydrolysis would be heptan-4-one.

But wait, the starting enamine is (E)-configured, which might influence the product's structure, perhaps.

Now, looking back at the options, option C says product B is heptan-4-one and the reagents are (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+.

Option D says reagents are (i)LDA; (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+; B is heptan-4-one.

Wait, what's the sequence of reagents?

In the enamine reaction, the steps are:

1. Deprotonate with a strong base (like LDA) to form the enamine anion.
2. Add the alkylating agent (ethyl iodide) to perform alkylation at the alpha position.
3. Acid workup to hydrolyze the enamine back into the ketone and the amine.

So the reagents would be:

(i) LDA (in DME solvent), then (ii) CH3CH2I, then (iii) H3O+.

Looking at the options, option C says reagents are (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+. And product is heptan-4-one.

But option D says (i) LDA; (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+; and product is heptan-4-one.

Wait, maybe the steps are done in a different order. Or perhaps the order is (i) LDA and DME together, then (ii) CH3CH2I and H3O+.

Wait, perhaps the first step is to deprotonate using LDA in DME. Then, add ethyl iodide. Then, acid to hydrolyze.

So the reagents would be three steps: LDA/DME, then ethyl iodide, then H3O+.

Looking at the options, option C is (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+. So that's three steps, which matches.

Option D is (i) LDA; (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+. So step (ii) includes all three. But I think that's not correct because LDA is typically used in DME, so perhaps step (i) is LDA and DME.

So if the correct reagent sequence is (i) LDA and DME, then (ii) ethyl iodide, then (iii) H3O+, then the product is heptan-4-one. Which is option C.

But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Let me check the options again.

Option C: A = (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+; B = heptan-4-one.

Option D: A = (i) LDA; (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+; B = heptan-4-one.

Wait, but step (i) in D is only LDA, without DME. That might not be correct because LDA is typically used in DME as the solvent.

So option C seems correct. But let's look at the product of option C, which is heptan-4-one, and option B's product is pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about the amine part. The starting enamine is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. The amine part is N-methyl ethanaminium. So when the enamine hydrolyzes, it would form pentan-2-one and the corresponding amine, which is N-methyl ethanamine.

But if the enamine has undergone alkylation, then the amine part would have an additional ethyl group.

Wait, no. The amine part comes from the original amine that formed the enamine. So if the enamine is formed from N-methyl ethanamine and pentan-2-one, after hydrolysis, you get back pentan-2-one and N-methyl ethanamine.

But in the options, some products are N,N-dimethylethanamine. Wait, so if the amine is N,N-dimethylethanamine, that's (CH3)2NCH2CH3, which is a quaternary ammonium if it's the + ion.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think again.

In the options, option A's product B is pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine. Option C's product is heptan-4-one.

So which is correct?

If the starting enamine is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium, then when it undergoes alkylation with ethyl iodide, the ketone product would be heptan-4-one, and the amine would remain as it was.

Wait, but the amine is part of the enamine. So when you hydrolyze, you get back the original amine and the new ketone. So the amine would be N-methyl ethanamine, not N,N-dimethylethanamine.

Wait, so if the product B is heptan-4-one, that comes from the alkylation. And the amine is N-methyl ethanamine.

Looking at the options, option C's product is heptan-4-one, but it doesn't mention the amine. The problem states that the product is B, but the options list B as a specific compound. So perhaps B is the ketone only, and the amine is a byproduct.

Wait, the question is about what is product B. Looking at the options, some options for B are combinations, like pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine (option B), but most are single compounds.

Wait, looking back, the question says: "Mention the product of the following reaction (B) and select the correct sequence of the reagents according to the reaction steps (A)."

So the product is B, which is a single compound. So perhaps in this case, B is the ketone heptan-4-one.

So the correct option would be C, which has product B as heptan-4-one, with the reagents being LDA/DME, then ethyl iodide, then H3O+.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a combination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: if the enamine is (E)-configured, after alkylation and hydrolysis, the ketone would have a certain configuration. But the options don't specify stereochemistry, so that's probably not an issue.

So, putting it all together, the reagents are LDA (in DME), then ethyl iodide, then acid. So the sequence is (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+. Product is heptan-4-one.

So the correct option is C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves an enamine, (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium, undergoing alkylation followed by hydrolysis. Enamines are electron-rich due to the conjugation between the amine and the carbonyl group, making them nucleophilic at the alpha position. The reaction sequence involves the following steps:

1. **Deprotonation**: A strong base like LDA (lithium diisopropylamide) is used in DME (1,2-dimethoxyethane) to deprotonate the enamine, making the alpha carbon more nucleophilic.
2. **Alkylation**: The deprotonated enamine reacts with an alkylating agent, CH₃CH₂I (ethyl iodide), at the alpha position, adding an ethyl group to the carbon adjacent to the nitrogen.
3. **Hydrolysis**: Acid workup (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the enamine back into a ketone and the corresponding amine.

The starting enamine is derived from pentan-2-one and a secondary amine. After alkylation, the chain length is extended by two carbons (from the ethyl group), resulting in a new ketone. The product of hydrolysis is heptan-4-one, as the ketone is positioned in the middle of the seven-carbon chain. The amine remains unchanged as N-methyl ethanamine.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. The product is listed as pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine, which does not match the expected product, heptan-4-one.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The product is also listed as pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine, which is inconsistent with the reaction mechanism.
- **Option C**: Correct. The reagents are (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH₃CH₂I; (iii) H₃O⁺, and the product is heptan-4-one, which aligns with the reaction sequence and expected outcome.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. While the product is heptan-4-one, the reagent sequence lists DME, CH₃CH₂I, and H₃O⁺ in the same step, which is not the correct order.

Thus, the correct sequence of reagents and product is described in **Option C**.

Answer: C

Okay, so I've got this question about enamine reactions, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Enamines are compounds formed from a secondary amine and a carbonyl compound, right? They're useful in organic synthesis because they can undergo various reactions, especially in forming rings or adding substituents.

The question gives me a starting material: (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. Hmm, that name is a bit complex. Let me break it down. The base structure is an ethanaminium, which I think is an ethylamine with a positive charge, perhaps as an ammonium ion. The substituents are N-methyl and pentan-2-ylidene. The (E) configuration suggests that the substituents are trans around the double bond.

Wait, pentan-2-ylidene would be a group like CH2-CH2-C=CH2? No, wait, pentan-2-ylidene is a substituent attached to a double bond. The structure would be CH2CH2-C=CH2? No, wait, maybe it's more like CH2CH2-C=CH2 but as a substituent on the amine. So the starting material is an enamine, I think.

The reaction is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium + reagent A → product B.

The options are about what reagent A is and what B is. The options give different sequences of reagents, and different products.

I remember that enamine reactions typically involve the amine's conjugate acid (the enamine) reacting with an electrophile. The general steps are: form the enamine, deprotonate it to make it more nucleophilic, add an electrophile, and then hydrolyze to get the amine and ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material is already an enamine. So when enamine reacts, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of alkylation. Because enamines can undergo alkylation at the alpha position (the position adjacent to the nitrogen) because the double bond makes it more electron-rich.

So, the reaction steps for an enamine might be: first, deprotonation to form a strong base. Then, alkylation with an alkyl halide. Finally, acid workup to protonate and hydrolyze.

Looking at the options, the reagents involve LDA (a strong base, which is lithium diisopropylamide), DME as a solvent, and then something like CH3CH2I (ethyl iodide), followed by H3O+ (acid workup).

Option A: (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+. Product is pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine.

Wait, but I thought the product would be a ketone formed after hydrolysis. Let me think about the reaction.

Enamine structure: the starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. That's the structure of an enamine. So when the enamine reacts, it can undergo alkylation.

So, in the presence of a strong base like LDA, the enamine would deprotonate, making the alpha position more nucleophilic. Then, an alkyl iodide like ethyl iodide would react, adding an ethyl group to the alpha position.

After that, acid workup (H3O+) would hydrolyze the enamine back to the ketone and the secondary amine.

Wait, but what's the structure before and after?

The starting enamine is derived from a ketone and a secondary amine. Let's say the amine is N-methyl ethanamine (since the product after hydrolysis is N,N-dimethylethanamine, which is CH32NHCH2CH3. Wait, no, N,N-dimethylethanamine is (CH3)2NCH2CH3, but that's a primary amine. Wait, no: ethanamine is CH3CH2NH2. If it's dimethyl, it's (CH3)2NHCH2CH3? No, wait, wait. N,N-dimethylethanamine would have the structure CH3CH2N(CH3)2, but wait, that would be a quaternary ammonium salt. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, the product after hydrolysis would be a ketone and a secondary amine. So the enamine is formed by a secondary amine and a ketone. So when you hydrolyze the enamine, you get back the original amine and the ketone.

So in this case, the enamine is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So the amine part is N-methyl ethanaminium. The ketone part is pentan-2-one, perhaps?

Wait, no. Wait, the enamine structure is R2C=CH-NR’2+. So the starting material here is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium.

Let me draw the structure. The main chain is CH2-CH2-C=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, pentan-2-ylidene is CH2CH2-C=CH2? No, pentan-2-ylidene would be CH2CH2-C=CH2, but that can't be right. Oh wait, pentan-2-ylidene is CH2CH2-C=CH-CH2. Wait, no, it's probably CH2-CH2-C=CH2. Hmm, perhaps it's CH2CH2-C=CH-CH2CH3? No, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the enamine is derived from pentan-2-one and a secondary amine. So, pentan-2-one is (CH2)2CO, which when reacted with a secondary amine would form the enamine. The amine is N-methyl ethanamine, which is (CH3)2NHCH2CH3? Wait, no: ethanaminium would be CH3CH2NH+.

Wait, perhaps the starting enamine is (E)-configured, meaning that the substituents on either side of the double bond are trans.

So, after deprotonation (using LDA, a strong base), the enamine becomes more nucleophilic. Then, it reacts with ethyl iodide (CH3CH2I), which is an alkylating agent. The ethyl group adds to the alpha position—the carbon adjacent to the nitrogen.

After that, acid workup hydrolyzes the enamine back into the ketone and the amine.

Wait, but the starting enamine is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So when we deprotonate, we get an enamine anion, which attacks the ethyl iodide. The ethyl group adds to the alpha carbon, making it a larger molecule. Then, upon hydrolysis, this would form a new ketone.

Wait, but the product B is supposed to be either pentan-2-one or heptan-4-one, depending on the option.

Let me think. The original enamine comes from a ketone and a secondary amine. Let's say the ketone is pentan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO). The secondary amine is N-methyl ethanamine, which is (CH3)2NCH2CH3. Wait, no, the amine is probably (CH3)2NHR, where R is the part from the enamine.

Wait, maybe the enamine is formed from pentan-2-one and N-methyl ethanamine. So when the enamine is hydrolyzed, it gives back pentan-2-one and the amine, which is N-methyl ethanamine.

But wait, if the enamine undergoes alkylation, adding an ethyl group, then upon hydrolysis, the ketone would be larger.

Let me model this. The enamine has a structure like R2C=CH-NR'R''. So when the alpha carbon (the one adjacent to N) is alkylated, it adds a group there. Hydrolysis would break the enamine into a ketone.

So for the starting enamine, the R groups are from the ketone and the amine.

Suppose the starting enamine is from pentan-2-one and a secondary amine, say, N-methyl ethanamine. The enamine is (E)-configured.

When you deprotonate with LDA, you get a strong base. Then, adding ethyl iodide would lead to alkylation at the alpha position. So the alpha carbon (which was part of the ketone) now has an ethyl group.

So the structure after alkylation would have an ethyl group added to the alpha position. Then, when hydrolyzed, that would form a ketone with one more carbon than before?

Wait, no. Let me think about the example. Suppose the enamine is formed from acetone (propan-2-one) and a secondary amine. Alkylation would add a group to the alpha position, making it a larger ketone upon hydrolysis.

So, if I have an enamine from pentan-2-one and an amine, and I add an ethyl group, perhaps the ketone becomes heptan-4-one?

Wait, let me count. Pentan-2-one is (CH2)2CO. If you add two carbons (ethyl) to the alpha position, that would make a longer chain. But wait, adding ethyl would add two carbons, but where?

Alternatively, perhaps the enamine is from pentan-2-one and a secondary amine. So the enamine would have the structure (CH2)2CO → (CH2)2C=CH-NR'R''.

When alkylation occurs, the CH2 becomes CH2CH2. So after adding ethyl, the alpha carbon is now CH2CH2. Upon hydrolysis, this would form a ketone. Let's see: the original structure is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium.

After alkylation, the structure would have an ethyl group added to the alpha position. So the enamine after alkylation would have an extended chain. Upon hydrolysis, the ketone would be pentan-2-one plus two carbons? Or maybe the position shifts.

Wait, maybe I should think about this more clearly. The starting enamine has a structure where the double bond is between C2 and C3 of pentane. So, the enamine is derived from pentan-2-one.

Let me draw the enamine structure as follows: The main chain is CH2-CH2-C(=N)-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, perhaps it's more like CH2CH2-C=CH-NR'R''.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the enamine as:

R2C=CH-NR'R''

Where R2C is from the ketone, R' and R'' are from the amine.

So, if the original ketone is pentan-2-one, which is (CH2)2CO. The enamine will have R2C as (CH2)2C-.

So, the enamine would look like (CH2)2C=CH-NR'R''.

Upon alkylation, the alpha carbon (the one adjacent to N) is where the ethyl group is added.

So, when the enamine is deprotonated, the alpha carbon becomes more nucleophilic. It attacks the ethyl iodide, adding an ethyl group there.

So, the structure after alkylation would be (CH2)2C=CH-CH2CH2-NR'R''.

Wait, no, perhaps it's CH2-CH2-C=CH-CH2CH2-NR'R''.

Wait, no, perhaps the alkylation occurs on the carbon adjacent to the N. So, in the enamine, the structure is CH2-CH2-C=CH-NR'R''.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more accurately represented as:

(CH2)2-C=CH-N(CH3)(R''), where R'' is another substituent from the amine.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about hydrolysis. The enamine, after alkylation, undergoes hydrolysis to form a ketone and the corresponding amine.

So, if the enamine was from pentan-2-one and an amine, adding an ethyl group via alkylation would result in a new ketone which is heptan-4-one.

Wait, let me count: original ketone is pentan-2-one (5 carbons). Adding an ethyl group would make it 5 + 2 =7 carbons. But where is the ketone group positioned?

In the enamine, the double bond is between C2 and C3 (from pentan-2-one). Alkylation adds a group to C3, perhaps. Upon hydrolysis, the ketone would be in the middle of the chain.

Wait, perhaps the original enamine is:

CH2CH2-C=CH-NR'R''.

After alkylation, maybe it's CH2CH2-C=CH-CH2CH3-NR'R''.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think about the positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkylation adds to the alpha position, which is the carbon adjacent to the N. So the enamine's structure is:

R2C=CH-NR'R''.

So R2C is from the ketone. Let's say R2 is (CH2)2. Then, R is from the amine.

After alkylation, the structure becomes R2C=CH-CH2CH3-NR'R''.

Wait, no, the attack is on the alpha position (the CH2 next to N). So, the enamine after alkylation would have an ethyl group added to that position.

So when you hydrolyze, you break the N-C bond, and the carbonyl is formed. So the new ketone would be (CH2)2-C-O-CH2CH3?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's think of a concrete example.

Suppose the enamine is derived from pentan-2-one and dimethylamine. The enamine would be (CH2CH2)C=CH-N(CH3)2.

Wait, that's not right. Wait, the enamine has the structure R2C=CH-NR'R''. So if the original ketone is pentan-2-one ( (CH2)2CO ), then R2C would be (CH2)2C-. So the enamine is (CH2)2C=CH-NR'R''.

Then, if an ethyl group is added via alkylation, it would attach to the alpha carbon (the CH in the CH-NR'R'' part). Wait, no, the alpha carbon is the one adjacent to the N. So the enamine is R2C=CH-NR'R''. The alpha carbon is the CH, which is next to the N.

So when we deprotonate, the alpha carbon becomes more nucleophilic. Then, the ethyl iodide would add an ethyl group to that carbon.

So the structure after alkylation would be R2C=CH-CH2CH2-NR'R''.

Wait, but that would make the structure R2C=CH-CH2CH2-NR'R''.

Wait, but that's not correct because the double bond is between C and CH, so adding an ethyl would have to be on the same carbon.

Hmm, perhaps I should draw it. The enamine structure is:

(CH2)2C=CH-NR'R''.

After deprotonating, the CH becomes a carbanion, which then attacks CH3CH2I, adding the ethyl group to that carbon.

So the structure becomes (CH2)2C=CH(CH2CH3)-NR'R''.

Wait, but that can't be right because the double bond is between C and CH, adding an ethyl to the CH would make it CH2CH2, which would disrupt the double bond.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Maybe the enamine is (CH2CH2)–C=CH–NR'R''.

So the alpha position is the CH. Adding an ethyl group to that CH would give CH2CH2–C=CH(CH2CH3)–NR'R''.

But that would make the CH2CH3 attached to the same carbon as the double bond, which might not be possible. Alternatively, perhaps the double bond shifts.

Wait, perhaps the alkylation occurs at the alpha carbon, leading to the formation of a new structure, which upon hydrolysis gives a ketone.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the product. The options indicate that product B is either pentan-2-one or heptan-4-one.

If the starting material is an enamine derived from pentan-2-one, and after alkylation, the product is heptan-4-one, that makes sense. Because adding an ethyl group would increase the chain length by two.

Wait, but wait. Let's think: the starting ketone is pentan-2-one (5 carbons). If the enamine undergoes alkylation, adding an ethyl group (2 carbons), the product would be a ketone with 5 + 2 =7 carbons. But where is the ketone group?

If the original was pentan-2-one, the new ketone would be heptan-4-one. Because the ethyl is added to the alpha position, which is next to the carbonyl in the original ketone.

Wait, but in the enamine, the position is different. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the product is heptan-4-one. Let me see: 4 is the position of the ketone in a 7-carbon chain. Pentan-2-one is 5 carbons with the ketone at position 2.

If you add two carbons (ethyl group) to the alpha position (position 3 in pentan-2-one), the new chain would be longer. Let's count: pentan-2-one is (CH3)2CO.

After adding ethyl to position 3, the structure becomes CH2CH2CO-CH2CH2-... Hmm, maybe I'm not getting this right.

Wait, perhaps the product is heptan-4-one. Heptan-4-one is (CH2)3CO(CH2)2CH3. So, the chain has seven carbons with the ketone in the middle.

Wait, if the starting ketone is pentan-2-one (5 carbons, ketone at C2), and the enamine forms, then alkylation adds two carbons (from ethyl), making the chain 5 + 2 =7 carbons. The ketone's position would be in the middle, which would be heptan-4-one.

So the product after hydrolysis would be heptan-4-one.

But wait, the starting enamine is (E)-configured, which might influence the product's structure, perhaps.

Now, looking back at the options, option C says product B is heptan-4-one and the reagents are (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+.

Option D says reagents are (i)LDA; (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+; B is heptan-4-one.

Wait, what's the sequence of reagents?

In the enamine reaction, the steps are:

1. Deprotonate with a strong base (like LDA) to form the enamine anion.
2. Add the alkylating agent (ethyl iodide) to perform alkylation at the alpha position.
3. Acid workup to hydrolyze the enamine back into the ketone and the amine.

So the reagents would be:

(i) LDA (in DME solvent), then (ii) CH3CH2I, then (iii) H3O+.

Looking at the options, option C says reagents are (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+. And product is heptan-4-one.

But option D says (i) LDA; (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+; and product is heptan-4-one.

Wait, maybe the steps are done in a different order. Or perhaps the order is (i) LDA and DME together, then (ii) CH3CH2I and H3O+.

Wait, perhaps the first step is to deprotonate using LDA in DME. Then, add ethyl iodide. Then, acid to hydrolyze.

So the reagents would be three steps: LDA/DME, then ethyl iodide, then H3O+.

Looking at the options, option C is (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+. So that's three steps, which matches.

Option D is (i) LDA; (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+. So step (ii) includes all three. But I think that's not correct because LDA is typically used in DME, so perhaps step (i) is LDA and DME.

So if the correct reagent sequence is (i) LDA and DME, then (ii) ethyl iodide, then (iii) H3O+, then the product is heptan-4-one. Which is option C.

But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Let me check the options again.

Option C: A = (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+; B = heptan-4-one.

Option D: A = (i) LDA; (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+; B = heptan-4-one.

Wait, but step (i) in D is only LDA, without DME. That might not be correct because LDA is typically used in DME as the solvent.

So option C seems correct. But let's look at the product of option C, which is heptan-4-one, and option B's product is pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about the amine part. The starting enamine is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. The amine part is N-methyl ethanaminium. So when the enamine hydrolyzes, it would form pentan-2-one and the corresponding amine, which is N-methyl ethanamine.

But if the enamine has undergone alkylation, then the amine part would have an additional ethyl group.

Wait, no. The amine part comes from the original amine that formed the enamine. So if the enamine is formed from N-methyl ethanamine and pentan-2-one, after hydrolysis, you get back pentan-2-one and N-methyl ethanamine.

But in the options, some products are N,N-dimethylethanamine. Wait, so if the amine is N,N-dimethylethanamine, that's (CH3)2NCH2CH3, which is a quaternary ammonium if it's the + ion.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think again.

In the options, option A's product B is pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine. Option C's product is heptan-4-one.

So which is correct?

If the starting enamine is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium, then when it undergoes alkylation with ethyl iodide, the ketone product would be heptan-4-one, and the amine would remain as it was.

Wait, but the amine is part of the enamine. So when you hydrolyze, you get back the original amine and the new ketone. So the amine would be N-methyl ethanamine, not N,N-dimethylethanamine.

Wait, so if the product B is heptan-4-one, that comes from the alkylation. And the amine is N-methyl ethanamine.

Looking at the options, option C's product is heptan-4-one, but it doesn't mention the amine. The problem states that the product is B, but the options list B as a specific compound. So perhaps B is the ketone only, and the amine is a byproduct.

Wait, the question is about what is product B. Looking at the options, some options for B are combinations, like pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine (option B), but most are single compounds.

Wait, looking back, the question says: "Mention the product of the following reaction (B) and select the correct sequence of the reagents according to the reaction steps (A)."

So the product is B, which is a single compound. So perhaps in this case, B is the ketone heptan-4-one.

So the correct option would be C, which has product B as heptan-4-one, with the reagents being LDA/DME, then ethyl iodide, then H3O+.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a combination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: if the enamine is (E)-configured, after alkylation and hydrolysis, the ketone would have a certain configuration. But the options don't specify stereochemistry, so that's probably not an issue.

So, putting it all together, the reagents are LDA (in DME), then ethyl iodide, then acid. So the sequence is (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+. Product is heptan-4-one.

So the correct option is C.


The reaction involves an enamine, (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium, undergoing alkylation followed by hydrolysis. Enamines are electron-rich due to the conjugation between the amine and the carbonyl group, making them nucleophilic at the alpha position. The reaction sequence involves the following steps:

1. **Deprotonation**: A strong base like LDA (lithium diisopropylamide) is used in DME (1,2-dimethoxyethane) to deprotonate the enamine, making the alpha carbon more nucleophilic.
2. **Alkylation**: The deprotonated enamine reacts with an alkylating agent, CH₃CH₂I (ethyl iodide), at the alpha position, adding an ethyl group to the carbon adjacent to the nitrogen.
3. **Hydrolysis**: Acid workup (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the enamine back into a ketone and the corresponding amine.

The starting enamine is derived from pentan-2-one and a secondary amine. After alkylation, the chain length is extended by two carbons (from the ethyl group), resulting in a new ketone. The product of hydrolysis is heptan-4-one, as the ketone is positioned in the middle of the seven-carbon chain. The amine remains unchanged as N-methyl ethanamine.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. The product is listed as pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine, which does not match the expected product, heptan-4-one.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The product is also listed as pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine, which is inconsistent with the reaction mechanism.
- **Option C**: Correct. The reagents are (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH₃CH₂I; (iii) H₃O⁺, and the product is heptan-4-one, which aligns with the reaction sequence and expected outcome.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. While the product is heptan-4-one, the reagent sequence lists DME, CH₃CH₂I, and H₃O⁺ in the same step, which is not the correct order.

Thus, the correct sequence of reagents and product is described in **Option C**.

Answer: C
