Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step. 

The question is asking for the maximum speed v_max of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. The oscillator has mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. The speed of light is c. I need to choose the correct expression from the given options.

Wait, wait. I remember that in classical mechanics, for a harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But here, it's relativistic, so I shouldn't use the classical expressions directly. Relativistic effects must come into play, probably involving the total energy.

In the relativistic case, the energy of the oscillator isn't just kinetic; it includes rest mass energy, kinetic energy, and potential energy. The total energy E should be the sum of rest mass energy (mc²) and the kinetic plus potential energies.

Let me think about the potential energy in a harmonic oscillator. The potential is U = (1/2)k x². So at maximum amplitude A, the potential energy is (1/2)k A².

In the classical case, the total energy E is (1/2)k A², which at maximum speed (x=0) converts entirely into kinetic energy (1/2)mv². So setting them equal gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). Oh wait, that's option C, which looks like the classical result. But in this question, it's relativistic, so option C is probably not the right answer. Let me see what the options are again.

Looking at the options, option C is v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). So that's the classical result. But the question is relativistic, so that's probably incorrect. So I can eliminate option C.

Now, I need to find the correct relativistic expression. Let's think about the energy. The total energy of the oscillator is the sum of the rest energy mc² and the kinetic and potential energies. But wait, in the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is treated in a way that incorporates relativistic effects? Or is it just using the classical expression?

I'm not entirely sure, but I think in the relativistic case, the potential energy is still considered as (1/2)k x², but when considering the total energy, which includes rest mass energy, the total energy at maximum displacement (x=A) would be the sum of rest energy and potential energy.

So, E_total = mc² + (1/2)k A².

At maximum speed, the oscillator is at x=0, so all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But wait, in relativity, kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². The correct relativistic kinetic energy is (γ - 1) mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, γ = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

So, the total energy E_total should also be the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy at maximum speed. So E_total = mc² + (γ - 1) mc² = γ mc².

But wait, E_total is also equal to mc² + (1/2)k A². So setting them equal:

γ mc² = mc² + (1/2)k A².

Divide both sides by mc²:

γ = 1 + (1/(2mc²)) (k A²).

So, γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 mc²).

But γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 mc²).

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 mc²) as some term, say, let's call it B for a moment. So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + B.

Where B is (k A²)/(2 mc²). 

So, sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + B).

Squaring both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + B)^2.

Then, v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + B)^2 ].

So,

v² = c^2 [ 1 - 1/(1 + B)^2 ].

Let me compute 1 - 1/(1+B)^2. Hmm, perhaps I can factor this.

Wait, 1/(1+B)^2 is [1/(1+B)]^2. So,

1 - [1/(1 + B)]^2 = [ (1 + B)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + B)^2.

Expanding the numerator: (1 + 2B + B²) - 1 = 2B + B².

So,

(2B + B²)/(1 + B)^2.

Factor numerator: B(2 + B).

So,

v² = c² [ B(2 + B) ] / (1 + B)^2.

But B is (k A²)/(2 mc²). Let's substitute that back:

v² = c² [ (k A²/(2 mc²)) ( 2 + (k A²)/(2 mc²) ) ] / (1 + (k A²/(2 mc²)) )^2.

Let me simplify this expression.

First, note that 2 + B = 2 + (k A²)/(2 mc²) = [4 + (k A²)/(mc²) ]/(2). Hmm, perhaps that's not the easiest way.

Wait, let me factor B:

v² = c² [ B (2 + B) ] / (1 + B)^2.

But B = (k A²)/(2 mc²) = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

v² = c² [ ( (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ( 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ) ] / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2.

Let me compute the numerator inside the brackets:

( (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) * [2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ] = (k A²)/(2 m c²) * [ (4 m c² + k A²) )/(2 m c²) ) ].

Wait, perhaps I can factor this differently. Alternatively, let me factor out (k A²)/(2 m c²) as B.

So,

v² = c² [ B (2 + B) ] / (1 + B)^2.

But let's compute the denominator:

(1 + B)^2 = 1 + 2B + B².

So,

v² = c² * [ B (2 + B) ] / (1 + 2B + B²).

Now, let's factor the numerator:

B(2 + B) = B (B + 2).

The denominator is (B +1)^2.

So,

v² = c² * [ B (B + 2) ] / ( (B + 1)^2 ).

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as:

v² = c² [ B (B + 2) ) / (B +1)^2 ].

Let me expand the numerator: B(B+2) = B² + 2B.

Denominator: (B +1)^2 = B² + 2B +1.

So,

v² = c² (B² + 2B) / ( B² + 2B + 1 ).

Hmm, that's interesting. Let me see if I can manipulate this.

Let me factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: B(B + 2)

Denominator: (B +1)^2.

So,

v²/c² = [ B (B +2) ] / (B +1)^2.

Let me write it as [ B/(B +1) ) ] * [ (B +2)/(B +1) ) ].

But that might not help. Alternatively, perhaps I can write this as:

[ B (B+2) ] / (B+1)^2 = [ (B^2 + 2B) ] / (B^2 + 2B +1) ) = [ ( (B^2 + 2B +1) -1 ) ] / (B^2 + 2B +1) ) = [ ( (B+1)^2 - 1 ) ] / ( (B+1)^2 )

Which becomes [ ( (B+1)^2 -1 ) ] / (B+1)^2 = [ ( (B+1)^2 )/( (B+1)^2 ) ) - 1/( (B+1)^2 ) ) ] = 1 - [ 1/(B +1)^2 ].

Wait, so:

v²/c² = [ B (B+2) ]/(B+1)^2 = 1 - 1/(B+1)^2.

So,

v² = c² [ 1 - 1/(B +1)^2 ].

But B is (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

B +1 = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

v² = c² [ 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2) )^2 ].

Taking square roots:

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2) )^2 ).

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 ), which matches what I have here.

Let me check option D: D) v_max = c√[1−1/(1 + kA²/(2 m c²) )² ]

Yes, that's exactly what I derived.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me recheck the energy expressions.

In the relativistic scenario, the total energy E is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy, but in the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2) k A² at maximum displacement. So when the oscillator is at x=0, all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So the total energy E should be the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy.

Wait, no. Wait, when the oscillator is at x=A, the potential energy is (1/2) k A², but the kinetic energy is zero. So the total energy E is mc² + (1/2) k A².

At maximum speed (x=0), all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So, the kinetic energy is (1/2) k A². But wait, in relativity, the kinetic energy is (γ -1) mc². So:

(γ -1) mc² = (1/2) k A².

So,

γ = 1 + ( (1/2) k A² )/( mc² ).

Which is the same as before. So the steps are correct.

So according to that, the maximum velocity is option D.

Looking back at the options:

Option D: v_max = c√[1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )² ]

Yes, that's correct.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we analyze the energy conservation in the relativistic context. The total energy \( E_{\text{total}} \) of the oscillator is the sum of its rest energy \( mc^2 \) and the potential energy at maximum amplitude \( x = A \), which is \( \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \). Thus:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

At maximum speed, all the potential energy is converted into relativistic kinetic energy. The relativistic kinetic energy is given by \( (\gamma - 1)mc^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Equating the total energy to the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy at maximum speed:

\[
\gamma mc^2 = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

Dividing through by \( mc^2 \), we find:

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we have:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Let \( B = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \). Then:

\[
\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{1 + B}.
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{(1 + B)^2}.
\]

Rearranging:

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + B)^2}.
\]

Substituting \( B = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), we get:

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

This matches option D. The other options are incorrect because:

- **Option A** and **Option B** involve incorrect forms of the denominator or numerator in the square root.
- **Option C** corresponds to the classical result, which does not account for relativistic effects.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
