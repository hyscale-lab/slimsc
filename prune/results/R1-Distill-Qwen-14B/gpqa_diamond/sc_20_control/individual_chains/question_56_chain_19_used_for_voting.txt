Okay, so I have this question about the hydrogen atom transitions, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by recalling what I know.

The question is about the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state to the |1,0,0⟩ state via two dipole transitions. Dipole transitions are governed by the selection rules, right? So for hydrogen, the selection rules are that Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. Also, for electrons transitioning, the change in the principal quantum number n isn't fixed but is related to the energy levels.

Wait, but in this case, the initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0. And the final state is n=1, l=0, m=0. So the atom is going from a higher energy state to a lower one. But it's decaying via two dipole transitions, meaning it goes through an intermediate state first.

So the process is |3,0,0⟩ → intermediate state → |1,0,0⟩. The intermediate state must satisfy the selection rules for each transition.

Let me think about the possible intermediate states. The initial state has l=0. So for the first transition, l can only change by ±1. So from l=0, it can go to l=1. So the intermediate state must have l=1.

So for the first transition, from |3,0,0⟩, the possible l after is 1. So the intermediate state is |n', l=1, m'⟩.

What can n' be? Since it's a dipole transition, n can change by any integer, but in practice, I think for hydrogen, it's more likely to transition to adjacent n levels, but maybe not always. Let me think. From n=3, the possible transitions would be n=2 or n=4, but since we're going to n=1, probably the intermediate is n=2 because you can't go from 3 to 1 in one dipole transition because that would require a change of Δn = -2, which isn't allowed by dipole transitions. Dipole transitions allow any Δn except 0, but wait, no... Wait, no, the selection rule for n is that it can change by any integer except zero, but in practice, most transitions are between adjacent n levels because of the matrix elements. Hmm, but wait, the initial state is n=3, final is n=1, so perhaps the intermediate state is n=2 because it's one step down from 3, and another step down from 2 to 1.

So first transition: 3→2, l=0→1, m=0→ m' where m' can be -1, 0, +1.

Wait, but the first transition's m can change by 0, ±1. The initial m is 0, so the intermediate m' can be -1, 0, +1.

So the intermediate state could be |2,1, -1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, or |2,1, +1⟩.

Then the second transition is from the intermediate state to |1,0,0⟩. Let's check the selection rules again. From l=1, l can go to l=0 (since Δl can be ±1). So that's good. The m of the intermediate state is m', so for the transition to |1,0,0⟩ (m=0), the m' must change by 0, ±1. So m_final = m_initial_second_trans - Δm, where Δm is 0, ±1.

Wait, the second transition is from the intermediate state (n=2, l=1, m') to the final state (n=1, l=0, m=0). So the change in m would be m_final - m_initial = 0 - m' = -m'. And this must be equal to Δm which can be 0, ±1.

Wait, no, the selection rule is that Δm = m_final - m_initial can be 0, ±1. So in this case, m_final is 0, m_initial is m'. So Δm = 0 - m' = -m' must be 0, ±1. So m' can be 0, ±1.

Which is already the case because our intermediate states have m' as -1, 0, +1. So for each of these, let's see.

- If intermediate m is 0: then Δm = 0-0=0, which is allowed.

- If intermediate m is +1: Δm = 0-1=-1, which is allowed (since Δm can be -1, 0, +1).

- If intermediate m is -1: Δm = 0 - (-1) = +1, which is allowed.

So all three intermediate m values are possible for the second transition.

But wait, what about the n change in the second transition. The intermediate is n=2, and the final is n=1. So Δn = -1, which is allowed because in dipole transitions, Δn can be any integer except 0, but in practice, the transitions are more likely when the difference is ±1.

So the possible intermediate states are |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩.

Wait, but the question says the decay is via two dipole transitions. So the first transition is |3,0,0⟩ → |something⟩, and then that something → |1,0,0⟩.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, probability 1/3.

Option B: 3→2,1,1 then 2,1,1→1,0,0. Probability 1/4.

Option C: 3→2,1,-1 →1,0,0. Probability 1/4.

Option D: I think it's a typo, but the first part is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ →... and probability 2/3.

Wait, the question says, which transition route and the corresponding probability. So the correct answer is the one which correctly follows the selection rules and has the correct probability.

Now, the probability part. Wait, how do we calculate the transition probabilities? Hmm, that's a bit tricky. The probability amplitude for each transition is determined by the matrix elements of the dipole operator, which depends on the spherical harmonics and the radial wavefunctions.

In hydrogen, the transition probability is proportional to the square of the matrix element, which involves integrals of the initial and final states with the dipole operator. The dipole operator has components proportional to rY_{1,m}(θ, φ).

For the transition from |n, l, m⟩ to |n', l', m'⟩, the matrix element is non-zero only if l' = l ±1 and m' = m ±1 or m. Additionally, for hydrogen, the radial part must also allow the transition, but for simplicity, perhaps the radial matrix elements are the same for all these cases, but I'm not certain.

But for the probabilities, the key point is the possible m changes and how that affects the square of the matrix elements.

Wait, but in the first transition, from |3,0,0⟩, the intermediate state can have m = -1, 0, +1. Then in the second transition, each of these can transition to m=0, as long as their m' differs by 0 or ±1.

But the overall probability would be the product of the probabilities of each individual transition.

Wait, but for the hydrogen atom, the dipole transition probabilities depend on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients and the overlap of the angular wavefunctions.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability is determined by the sum over possible intermediate states. Wait, but the problem is giving specific transition paths, so perhaps each option is a possible route, and we have to choose which one is possible and what the probability is.

Wait, but each option (A, B, C, D) specifies a particular route. So for each option, check if the transitions are allowed.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3,0,0→2,1,0→1,0,0.

Check selection rules:

First transition: l changes from 0 to 1 (Δl=+1), m changes from 0 to 0 (Δm=0). That's allowed.

Second transition: l changes from 1 to 0 (Δl=-1), m from 0 to 0 (Δm=0). Allowed.

So this is a possible route.

Option B: 3→2,1,1→1,0,0.

First transition: m goes from 0→1 (Δm=+1). Allowed.

Second transition: m goes from 1→0 (Δm=-1). Allowed.

So this is possible.

Option C: 3→2,1,-1→1,0,0.

First transition: m goes from 0→-1 (Δm=-1). Allowed.

Second transition: m from -1→0 (Δm=+1). Allowed.

So this is possible.

Option D: It says "3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 2/3." So same as option A except different probability.

Now, which of these options is correct?

But the question is about the decay via two dipole transitions. So the correct path must satisfy the selection rules for each step.

So all options A, B, C, D except perhaps D (because of the typo in the description) have valid transition steps.

But the question is about which transition route is correct and what is the probability.

Wait, the options specify the transition route and the corresponding probability. So the correct option must have a valid route and the correct probability.

So let's think about the possible probabilities.

The probability of each transition is determined by the square of the matrix element for each step.

But for hydrogen, the transition probability from an initial state |n, l, m⟩ to a final state |n', l', m'⟩ is proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient and the radial integral.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for the angular part is non-zero only if the selection rules are satisfied, which they are in all the options.

But the probabilities also depend on the possible m transitions. For the first transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1, m⟩, the possible m values are -1, 0, +1.

The probability for each m is the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for the transition from l=0 (s-state) to l=1 (p-state) are given by:

⟨1, m | 0,0⟩ ?

Wait, no, the initial state is l=0, so the angular part is Y_0^0. The dipole operator has components proportional to Y_1^m. So the matrix element is ∫ Y_0^0 Y_1^m* Y_l'^m' dΩ?

Wait, the dipole operator is proportional to r Y_1^m. So the matrix element for the transition is proportional to ⟨1,0 | Y_1^m | 3,0,0⟩, but perhaps I'm getting the direction mixed up.

Alternatively, the transition is from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1, m⟩. The matrix element for the dipole operator (say, the z-component) would involve an integral of Y_0^0 * Y_1^m * Y_1^0, because the initial state is l=0, and the dipole operator has l=1.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the possible m transitions. From |3,0,0⟩, the possible m transitions are m = 0 ±1, but since m_initial is 0, the possible m's are -1, 0, +1.

But since the initial state is spherically symmetric (l=0, m=0), when it interacts with the dipole operator (which has l=1), the matrix element for the transition depends on the overlap between Y_0^0 and Y_1^m. The integral ∫ Y_0^0 Y_1^m* dΩ is zero except when m=0, because Y_0^0 is symmetric, and Y_1^m has certain symmetries.

Wait, let me compute that integral. The integral of Y_0^0 Y_1^m* dΩ.

We know that Y_0^0 is (1/(2√π))^½. Y_1^m is proportional to (x ± iy) or something like that, depending on m.

But when m ≠ 0, the integral ∫ Y_0^0 Y_1^m dΩ = 0, because Y_1^m for m≠0 are not spherically symmetric. Only Y_1^0 is real and symmetric in a certain way. Wait, actually, when you multiply Y_0^0 (which is spherically symmetric) by Y_1^m (which for m≠0 has a specific angular dependence), the product will be an odd function under certain rotations, leading the integral to be zero.

Wait, more accurately, the integral ∫ Y_{l'}^{m'} * Y_{1}^{m} Y_{l}^{m''} dΩ is non-zero only if certain angular momentum coupling conditions are met. But in our case, l' is 0 (since initial state is l=0), l=1 (dipole operator), and the final state has l=1.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let's think differently. The initial state is |3,0,0⟩, and the dipole operator has components (like Y_1^0, Y_1^+1, Y_1^-1). So the matrix element ⟨2,1, m | er Y_1^m | 3,0,0⟩ would be non-zero only if m=0, because Y_0^0 is symmetric.

Wait, no, actually, the dipole operator has components that can change the angular momentum by ±1. Since the initial state is spherically symmetric (l=0), the only possible m after the transition are m=0, because when you integrate Y_0^0 multiplied by Y_1^m, the result is zero unless m=0.

Wait, let me compute the integral:

⟨1, m | Y_1^m | 0, 0⟩ = ∫ Y_1^m* Y_1^m Y_0^0 dΩ.

But Y_0^0 is 1/(2√π)^½. Y_1^m is proportional to sinθ e^{i m φ} or something like that.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The product Y_1^m * Y_0^0 is proportional to Y_1^m. Integrating over all solid angles, this would be zero unless m=0. Because Y_1^m for m≠0 are not symmetric in φ, so their integral over φ would be zero.

So the only non-zero matrix element is when m=0.

Wait, that would mean that the intermediate state after the first transition must have m=0. So |2,1,0⟩.

If that's the case, then the correct transition is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, which is option A.

So the probability would be the square of the matrix element for the first transition multiplied by the square of the matrix element for the second transition.

But wait, the first transition's matrix element is non-zero only for m=0, so the probability for that transition is from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,0⟩, and then from |2,1,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩.

So the overall probability would be the product of the two transition probabilities.

What's the probability for each step? For the first transition, the initial state is |3,0,0⟩, and the only allowed m is 0. So the probability for the first transition is the square of the matrix element for m=0. Since there are no other possibilities, the probability is 1 for the first transition, but wait, no. Because in reality, the initial state can transition to any of the possible m states, but in this case, only m=0 is allowed.

Wait, but if the initial state has l=0 and m=0, and the dipole operator allows transitions to m= -1, 0, +1, but in reality, due to the symmetry, only m=0 is possible. So the first transition can only go to |2,1,0⟩. Which means the transition probability is 100% for that step. Then the second transition is from |2,1,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩.

What about the second transition? The initial state is |2,1,0⟩, and the final is |1,0,0⟩. So m changes from 0 to 0 (Δm=0), and l changes from 1 to 0 (Δl=-1). So that's allowed.

What's the matrix element for that transition? Again, the dipole operator can cause a change in m by 0, ±1. So for the transition from |2,1,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩, the change in m is 0. So the matrix element is non-zero.

But what is the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for this? The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient ⟨0,0 | 1,0⟩ is 1, because 0,0 is obtained by combining 1,0 and 0,0 (since 0 is a possible value from 1 + 0).

Wait, but actually, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient ⟨0,0 | 1,0⟩ is 1. But I'm getting a bit confused here. Another way: when you have a state |1,0⟩, you can combine it with |0,0⟩ to get |0,0⟩. The coefficient is 1, I think.

So the matrix elements for the second transition would be non-zero, and the probability would be the square of that coefficient.

Wait, but the exact value depends on the radial integrals and the angular parts.

If the first transition's probability is 1 (since only m=0 is allowed), and the second transition's probability is some value, say P, then the overall probability would be P.

But the question is about the total probability of the decay via this two-step route.

Alternatively, perhaps each transition's probability is determined by the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

For the first transition from |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is 1 (since only m=0 is allowed), so the probability for this step is 1.

For the second transition, |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is also 1 (since it's a straightforward transition with Δl=-1 and Δm=0).

But wait, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for the angular part isn't enough; the radial part also matters. The radial integral for the dipole transition from 2,1,0 to 1,0,0 may not be zero, but the exact value would depend on the overlap of the radial wavefunctions.

But perhaps, for hydrogen, the probability for the transition from |n', l'=1, m'=0⟩ to |n''=n'-1, l''=0, m''=0⟩ is proportional to (n' - n'' ) something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the total probability for the process is the product of the probabilities for each step.

If the first step's probability is 1, and the second step's probability is some value, then the total would be that value.

But looking at the options, option A says the probability is 1/3, and option D says 2/3.

Wait, perhaps the total number of possible paths is 3 (since the first transition could have m=-1,0,+1, but in reality, only m=0 is allowed. Alternatively, maybe it's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Maybe the initial state |3,0,0⟩ can transition to any of the |2,1,m⟩ states (m=-1,0, +1) with certain probabilities, and then each of these can transition to |1,0,0⟩.

But earlier, I thought that only m=0 would have a non-zero matrix element because of the symmetry. But perhaps I was incorrect.

Wait, let me think about the matrix element again. The dipole operator has components like x, y, z, which are proportional to Y_1^1, Y_1^-1, Y_1^0.

So when the initial state is |3,0,0⟩ (Y_0^0), the transition to |2,1, m⟩ would occur via the matrix element involving Y_1^m.

Thus, the matrix element is:

⟨2,1,m | er Y_1^m | 3,0,0⟩ = 0 unless m=0?

Wait, because Y_0^0 multiplied by Y_1^m is only non-zero when m=0. Because when you multiply Y_0^0 (which is 1/(2√π)^½) by Y_1^m, the integral over all angles would be zero unless m=0.

Wait, actually, the integral ∫ Y_1^m*(θ,φ) Y_0^0 dΩ is zero unless m=0. Because Y_0^0 is symmetric, and Y_1^m for m≠0 are not symmetric under azimuthal rotations.

So yes, only m=0 for the first transition is allowed. So the first transition must go to |2,1,0⟩.

Then, the second transition from |2,1,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩.

So the only possible route is 3→2,1,0→1,0,0. So that's option A.

Now, what about the probability?

The probability would be the product of the probabilities of each transition. But perhaps the first transition is certain (probability 1), and the second transition has probability P.

But the question gives the total probability as 1/3, 1/4, 2/3, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability is determined by the possible ways the atom can decay through two steps, considering all possible intermediates.

Wait, but in this scenario, only the |2,1,0⟩ state is accessible in the first step.

So the total probability for this route is the product of each step's probability.

But wait, perhaps the first transition's probability is not 1. Maybe multiple m are allowed, but the matrix elements vary.

Wait, but earlier reasoning said only m=0 is allowed for the first transition.

So the first transition probability is 1 (since only one possibility), and the second transition's probability would be based on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient and the radial integral.

But I'm not exactly sure about the exact value.

Alternatively, perhaps the decay proceeds through all possible intermediates, but only the |2,1,0⟩ state is accessible. So the overall probability is the product.

But looking at the options, option A says the probability is 1/3. How?

Wait, perhaps the possible transition routes are from |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1, m⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, and each m has a certain probability. But earlier we thought that only m=0 is allowed. But perhaps I'm wrong, and all m are allowed but with different probabilities.

Wait, let's think about the dipole operator. The dipole operator has three components: x, y, z. Each component corresponds to a different m.

The matrix elements for the three possible transitions (m=-1, 0, +1) would be non-zero, but with different magnitudes.

Because the dipole operator in the z-direction (Y_1^0) will have a matrix element that's non-zero, and the x and y components (Y_1^±1) will also have non-zero matrix elements, but perhaps with different coefficients.

Wait, but the initial state is |3,0,0⟩, which is spherically symmetric. So when you apply the dipole operator, the resulting state has l=1, but the m values depend on the component of the dipole operator used.

So for the transition via the z-component (Y_1^0), you get m=0.

For the transition via the x-component (which is a combination of Y_1^1 and Y_1^-1), you might get both m=+1 and m=-1.

Hmm, perhaps the matrix elements for m=+1 and m=-1 are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign.

But the probabilities would then be the square of these matrix elements.

So the probability for the first transition to m=0 would be higher than for m=±1, perhaps.

Wait, let me think about the matrix elements more carefully.

The dipole operator can be written as:

r = r (x, y, z) = r (Y_1^1 + Y_1^-1 + Y_1^0) ?

Wait, no, the components are:

The vector spherical harmonics are Y_1^m, but the actual components are:

x = √(4π/3) Y_1^{-1} + √(4π/3) Y_1^{+1} }

Wait, no, perhaps I should recall that:

The position vector in spherical coordinates is given by:

r = a r (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ), where a is a scaling factor.

But the spherical harmonics Y_1^m are functions of θ and φ.

The components of the dipole operator can be expressed in terms of Y_1^m. So, for example:

e r = e (x, y, z) = e ( r sinθ cosφ, r sinθ sinφ, r cosθ )

Each component can be expressed as combinations of Y_1^m.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think about the transition dipole moment.

The transition dipole moment is given by:

⟨f | r | i⟩ = ∫ Y_{l_f}^{m_f}* Y_1^{m'} Y_{l_i}^{m_i} dΩ.

In our case, l_i = 0, m_i = 0.

So this reduces to:

⟨f | r | i⟩ = ∫ Y_{l_f}^{m_f}* Y_1^{m'} Y_0^0 dΩ.

Since Y_0^0 is 1/(2√π)^½, this simplifies to:

⟨f | r | i⟩ = ∫ Y_{l_f}^{m_f}* Y_1^{m'} dΩ * (1/(2√π)^½ ).

Which is non-zero only if the angular momentum coupling allows it. The integral is non-zero when l_f = l_i ± 1. Since l_i=0, l_f must be 1. Which aligns with our selection rules.

So for each m', the transition is possible when m_f = m_i + m', but since m_i=0, m_f = m'.

Wait, no, because the dipole operator can change m by m'.

So the matrix element is non-zero when m_f = m_i + m', where m' is the m of the dipole component. But in our case, m_i=0, so m_f = m'.

Thus, for each component of the dipole operator (m' = -1, 0, +1), the final state has m_f = m'.

So the possible m_f values are -1, 0, +1, each corresponding to a different component of the dipole operator.

But since the initial state is spherically symmetric, the matrix elements for each m' must be considered.

The matrix element for m' = 0 is ⟨2,1,0 | Y_1^0 |3,0,0⟩.

Similarly for m' = +1 and -1.

But the integral for m' = 0 is:

∫ Y_{1,0}^* Y_{1,0} Y_{0,0} dΩ.

Which is ∫ Y_{1,0}^* Y_{1,0} dΩ multiplied by Y_{0,0} (which is 1/(2√π)^½ ).

Wait, no, because Y_0^0 is a constant. So the integral becomes:

(1/(2√π)^½ ) ∫ Y_{1,0}^* Y_{1,0} dΩ.

But ∫ Y_{l m}^* Y_{l m} dΩ = 1, so the integral becomes (1/(2√π)^½ ) * 1.

Wait, but that can't be right because Y_{1,0} is not normalized in this way. Actually, the integral ∫ Y_{l m}^* Y_{l m} dΩ = 1.

But in our case, the matrix element for m'=0 is ∫ Y_{1,0}^* Y_{0,0} Y_{1,0} dΩ.

Wait, no, perhaps I should think about it differently. The initial state is Y_{0,0}, the dipole operator is proportional to Y_{1, m'}, and the final state is Y_{1, m_f}.

The matrix element is proportional to ∫ Y_{1, m_f}^* Y_{1, m'} Y_{0,0} dΩ.

But since Y_{0,0} is 1/(2√π)^½, this becomes:

(1/(2√π)^½ ) ∫ Y_{1, m_f}^* Y_{1, m'} dΩ.

Which is zero unless m_f = m' because the integral of Y_{1 m_f}^* Y_{1 m'} is zero unless m_f = m'.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The integral ∫ Y_{a}^* Y_{b} dΩ is zero unless a = b. Because the Y_{l m} are orthonormal.

So for each m', the integral is zero unless m_f = m'.

So, for each m', the matrix element is non-zero only if m_f = m'.

But in our transition, the first transition is from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1, m'⟩.

So m' can be -1, 0, +1, but the matrix element is non-zero only if m_f = m'.

So the possible m's are -1, 0, +1.

But wait, the initial state is |3,0,0⟩, and the dipole operator's components have m' = -1, 0, +1. So the matrix element is non-zero for each m', leading to transitions to |2,1, m'⟩.

But earlier, I thought that the matrix element would be zero for m'≠0 because of the integral involving Y_{1, m'} Y_{0,0}.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recast this.

The matrix element is:

⟨2,1,m' | er Y_1^{m'} |3,0,0⟩.

Which is proportional to ∫ Y_{1, m'}^* Y_{1, m'} Y_{0,0} dΩ.

Wait, that's not correct. The dipole operator is proportional to Y_{1, m'}, so the matrix element involves Y_{1, m'} multiplied by Y_{0,0}.

Wait, perhaps the correct expression is:

⟨2,1,m' | Y_{1, m'} | 3,0,0⟩.

Which is ∫ Y_{1, m'}^* Y_{1, m'} Y_{0,0} dΩ.

Wait, but that would be ∫ Y_{1, m'}^* Y_{1, m'} Y_{0,0} dΩ.

Y_{0,0} is 1/(2√π)^½, so:

(1/(2√π)^½) ∫ Y_{1, m'}^* Y_{1, m'} dΩ.

Which is (1/(2√π)^½ ) * ∫ |Y_{1, m'}|^2 dΩ.

But ∫ |Y_{1, m'}|^2 dΩ = 1, since they are orthonormal.

So the matrix element is (1/(2√π)^½ ) * 1.

Wait, but this would imply that the matrix element is the same for each m' (i.e., m' = -1, 0, +1), which would mean that each transition to |2,1, m'⟩ has the same probability.

But that can't be right because the actual values of Y_{1, m'} vary, and their products with Y_{0,0} might not be the same.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor here. Let me compute the actual integral for each m'.

The integral is ∫ Y_{1, m'}^* Y_{1, m'} Y_{0,0} dΩ.

But Y_{0,0} is 1/(2√π)^½, so it's a constant.

So the integral becomes (1/(2√π)^½ ) ∫ Y_{1, m'}^* Y_{1, m'} dΩ.

Which is (1/(2√π)^½ ) * 1, since Y_{1, m'} is normalized.

Thus, the matrix element is the same for each m', meaning that the transition probabilities to m' = -1, 0, +1 are the same.

Wait, but that doesn't align with the symmetry of the problem. Because the dipole operator's z-component (m'=0) is real and symmetric, whereas the x (m'=±1) components are complex conjugates.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again: the matrix element is proportional to the integral:

∫ Y_{1, m'}^* Y_{1, m'} Y_{0,0} dΩ.

But since Y_{0,0} is spherically symmetric, this integral is the same for all m', because Y_{1, m'}^* Y_{1, m'} is |Y_{1, m'}|^2, which depends only on θ and not φ. So the integral over φ would be ∫0^{2π} dφ, which is the same for all m'.

But wait, Y_{1, m'}^* Y_{1, m'} is |Y_{1, m'}|^2, which is a function of θ only, since Y_{1, m'} depends on θ and φ. For m' = 0, Y_{1,0} is proportional to cosθ. For m' = ±1, Y_{1, ±1} are proportional to sinθ e^{±iφ}.

So when you take Y_{1, m'}^* Y_{1, m'}, for m' = ±1, you get |Y_{1, ±1}|^2 = (sinθ)^2, same as for m'=0.

Wait, no: Y_{1,0} is proportional to cosθ, so its square is cos²θ.

Y_{1, ±1} are proportional to sinθ e^{±iφ}, so their squares are proportional to sin²θ, same as for m'=0.

So the integral ∫ |Y_{1, m'}|^2 Y_{0,0} dΩ is the same for all m'?

Wait, no. Because Y_{0,0} is 1/(2√π)^½, a constant. So the integral becomes (1/(2√π)^½ ) * ∫ |Y_{1, m'}|^2 dΩ.

But ∫ |Y_{1, m'}|^2 dΩ = 1 for each m'.

Thus, the matrix element would be the same for all m', implying that each transition (m' = -1, 0, +1) has the same probability.

But that doesn't seem right because the transition probabilities should depend on the specific matrix element.

Wait, but for the dipole operator, the transition probabilities for each m' should be the same, because the matrix elements for each are the same in magnitude.

So if that's the case, the first transition has three possible paths (m' = -1, 0, +1), each with equal probability.

So the probability for each first transition is 1/3.

Then, for each of these, the second transition is to |1,0,0⟩.

But the second transition's probability depends on the intermediate m'.

As discussed earlier, the second transition from |2,1,m'⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ is allowed only if m' can transition to m=0 via Δm=0, ±1.

So for each m' in the intermediate state:

- If m' = 0: Δm = 0 → allowed, and the matrix element is non-zero.

- If m' = +1: Δm = -1 → allowed.

- If m' = -1: Δm = +1 → allowed.

So each intermediate state can transition to the final state.

But the probability for each second transition depends on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients and the radial integrals.

Assuming the radial integrals are the same for all m', the probability for each second transition would be the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for the angular part.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining |1, m⟩ and |0,0⟩ to get |0,0⟩.

Wait, the state |0,0⟩ can be formed by combining |1,0⟩ and |0,0⟩.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient ⟨0,0 | 1,0; 0,0⟩ is 1, because you're adding l=1 and l=0.

Wait, no: the state |0,0⟩ can be formed by combining |1, m⟩ and |0,0⟩ only if m=0, because 1 + 0 = 1, and m=0 can give m_total=0.

So for each intermediate m', the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for the transition to |0,0⟩ is 1 when m' =0, and for m'=±1, it would be zero because you can't combine m=1 and m=0 to get m=0.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me think again.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient ⟨0,0 | 1, m'⟩ is zero unless m'=0. Because you're combining l=1 and l=0 to get l=0. So to get m=0, the only possibility is m' =0, because 0 + 0 =0.

So for m'=0, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is 1.

For m'=±1, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero because you can't combine m'=1 (from l=1) and m=0 (from l=0) to get m=0.

Wait, but that contradicts earlier reasoning. Did I get the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients wrong?

Wait, the state |0,0⟩ can be formed by combining |1,0⟩ and |0,0⟩. The coefficient is 1.

But for |1, m'⟩ where m'≠0, the combination can't contribute to |0,0⟩ because m' + 0 ≠0.

So, the transition from |2,1,m'⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ is allowed only if m'=0.

Thus, only the intermediate state with m'=0 can transition to the final state |1,0,0⟩.

Which means that the only possible path is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩.

Thus, the probability for the entire process is the product of the probabilities of each step.

The first step has a probability of 1/3 (since there are three equally likely m'= -1,0, +1 transitions), and the second step has a probability of 1 (since m'=0 can transition, others cannot).

Wait, but earlier I thought the first step's probabilities are equal for each m', which would be 1/3 each.

So the total probability for the entire decay is (1/3) * 1 = 1/3.

Which corresponds to option A: probability 1/3.

So the correct answer is option A.

The question involves the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state in the hydrogen atom to the |1,0,0⟩ state via two dipole transitions. The transitions are governed by the selection rules: Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. The decay proceeds through an intermediate state |2,1,m⟩, where m can be -1, 0, or +1. The probability of the overall decay depends on the allowed transitions and their respective probabilities.

### Key Analysis:
1. **First Transition (|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m⟩):**
   - The initial state |3,0,0⟩ has l=0, m=0. The dipole operator allows transitions to states with l=1 and m = -1, 0, +1.
   - The matrix elements for the transition depend on the overlap of the spherical harmonics. For a spherically symmetric initial state (l=0), the transition probabilities to m = -1, 0, +1 are equal due to symmetry considerations.
   - Thus, the probability for each m is 1/3.

2. **Second Transition (|2,1,m⟩ → |1,0,0⟩):**
   - The intermediate state |2,1,m⟩ transitions to the final state |1,0,0⟩. The selection rules require Δl = -1 and Δm = 0, ±1.
   - For the transition to occur, the intermediate state must have m = 0. This is because the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient ⟨0,0 | 1,m⟩ is non-zero only when m = 0. States with m = ±1 cannot transition to |1,0,0⟩.

3. **Overall Probability:**
   - The first transition to |2,1,0⟩ has a probability of 1/3 (since there are three equally likely m values: -1, 0, +1).
   - The second transition from |2,1,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ is certain (probability = 1), as it satisfies the selection rules.
   - The total probability for the decay is the product of the probabilities of the two transitions:  
     \[
     \text{Total Probability} = \frac{1}{3} \times 1 = \frac{1}{3}.
     \]

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A:** |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/3. This matches the analysis.
- **Option B:** |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/4. This is incorrect because the intermediate state |2,1,1⟩ cannot transition to |1,0,0⟩.
- **Option C:** |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/4. This is also incorrect because the intermediate state |2,1,-1⟩ cannot transition to |1,0,0⟩.
- **Option D:** |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 2/3. This is incorrect because the probability is not 2/3.

### Conclusion:
The correct transition route is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with a total probability of 1/3.

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I have this question about the hydrogen atom transitions, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by recalling what I know.

The question is about the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state to the |1,0,0⟩ state via two dipole transitions. Dipole transitions are governed by the selection rules, right? So for hydrogen, the selection rules are that Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. Also, for electrons transitioning, the change in the principal quantum number n isn't fixed but is related to the energy levels.

Wait, but in this case, the initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0. And the final state is n=1, l=0, m=0. So the atom is going from a higher energy state to a lower one. But it's decaying via two dipole transitions, meaning it goes through an intermediate state first.

So the process is |3,0,0⟩ → intermediate state → |1,0,0⟩. The intermediate state must satisfy the selection rules for each transition.

Let me think about the possible intermediate states. The initial state has l=0. So for the first transition, l can only change by ±1. So from l=0, it can go to l=1. So the intermediate state must have l=1.

So for the first transition, from |3,0,0⟩, the possible l after is 1. So the intermediate state is |n', l=1, m'⟩.

What can n' be? Since it's a dipole transition, n can change by any integer, but in practice, I think for hydrogen, it's more likely to transition to adjacent n levels, but maybe not always. Let me think. From n=3, the possible transitions would be n=2 or n=4, but since we're going to n=1, probably the intermediate is n=2 because you can't go from 3 to 1 in one dipole transition because that would require a change of Δn = -2, which isn't allowed by dipole transitions. Dipole transitions allow any Δn except 0, but wait, no... Wait, no, the selection rule for n is that it can change by any integer except zero, but in practice, most transitions are between adjacent n levels because of the matrix elements. Hmm, but wait, the initial state is n=3, final is n=1, so perhaps the intermediate state is n=2 because it's one step down from 3, and another step down from 2 to 1.

So first transition: 3→2, l=0→1, m=0→ m' where m' can be -1, 0, +1.

Wait, but the first transition's m can change by 0, ±1. The initial m is 0, so the intermediate m' can be -1, 0, +1.

So the intermediate state could be |2,1, -1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, or |2,1, +1⟩.

Then the second transition is from the intermediate state to |1,0,0⟩. Let's check the selection rules again. From l=1, l can go to l=0 (since Δl can be ±1). So that's good. The m of the intermediate state is m', so for the transition to |1,0,0⟩ (m=0), the m' must change by 0, ±1. So m_final = m_initial_second_trans - Δm, where Δm is 0, ±1.

Wait, the second transition is from the intermediate state (n=2, l=1, m') to the final state (n=1, l=0, m=0). So the change in m would be m_final - m_initial = 0 - m' = -m'. And this must be equal to Δm which can be 0, ±1.

Wait, no, the selection rule is that Δm = m_final - m_initial can be 0, ±1. So in this case, m_final is 0, m_initial is m'. So Δm = 0 - m' = -m' must be 0, ±1. So m' can be 0, ±1.

Which is already the case because our intermediate states have m' as -1, 0, +1. So for each of these, let's see.

- If intermediate m is 0: then Δm = 0-0=0, which is allowed.

- If intermediate m is +1: Δm = 0-1=-1, which is allowed (since Δm can be -1, 0, +1).

- If intermediate m is -1: Δm = 0 - (-1) = +1, which is allowed.

So all three intermediate m values are possible for the second transition.

But wait, what about the n change in the second transition. The intermediate is n=2, and the final is n=1. So Δn = -1, which is allowed because in dipole transitions, Δn can be any integer except 0, but in practice, the transitions are more likely when the difference is ±1.

So the possible intermediate states are |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩.

Wait, but the question says the decay is via two dipole transitions. So the first transition is |3,0,0⟩ → |something⟩, and then that something → |1,0,0⟩.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, probability 1/3.

Option B: 3→2,1,1 then 2,1,1→1,0,0. Probability 1/4.

Option C: 3→2,1,-1 →1,0,0. Probability 1/4.

Option D: I think it's a typo, but the first part is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ →... and probability 2/3.

Wait, the question says, which transition route and the corresponding probability. So the correct answer is the one which correctly follows the selection rules and has the correct probability.

Now, the probability part. Wait, how do we calculate the transition probabilities? Hmm, that's a bit tricky. The probability amplitude for each transition is determined by the matrix elements of the dipole operator, which depends on the spherical harmonics and the radial wavefunctions.

In hydrogen, the transition probability is proportional to the square of the matrix element, which involves integrals of the initial and final states with the dipole operator. The dipole operator has components proportional to rY_{1,m}(θ, φ).

For the transition from |n, l, m⟩ to |n', l', m'⟩, the matrix element is non-zero only if l' = l ±1 and m' = m ±1 or m. Additionally, for hydrogen, the radial part must also allow the transition, but for simplicity, perhaps the radial matrix elements are the same for all these cases, but I'm not certain.

But for the probabilities, the key point is the possible m changes and how that affects the square of the matrix elements.

Wait, but in the first transition, from |3,0,0⟩, the intermediate state can have m = -1, 0, +1. Then in the second transition, each of these can transition to m=0, as long as their m' differs by 0 or ±1.

But the overall probability would be the product of the probabilities of each individual transition.

Wait, but for the hydrogen atom, the dipole transition probabilities depend on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients and the overlap of the angular wavefunctions.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability is determined by the sum over possible intermediate states. Wait, but the problem is giving specific transition paths, so perhaps each option is a possible route, and we have to choose which one is possible and what the probability is.

Wait, but each option (A, B, C, D) specifies a particular route. So for each option, check if the transitions are allowed.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3,0,0→2,1,0→1,0,0.

Check selection rules:

First transition: l changes from 0 to 1 (Δl=+1), m changes from 0 to 0 (Δm=0). That's allowed.

Second transition: l changes from 1 to 0 (Δl=-1), m from 0 to 0 (Δm=0). Allowed.

So this is a possible route.

Option B: 3→2,1,1→1,0,0.

First transition: m goes from 0→1 (Δm=+1). Allowed.

Second transition: m goes from 1→0 (Δm=-1). Allowed.

So this is possible.

Option C: 3→2,1,-1→1,0,0.

First transition: m goes from 0→-1 (Δm=-1). Allowed.

Second transition: m from -1→0 (Δm=+1). Allowed.

So this is possible.

Option D: It says "3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 2/3." So same as option A except different probability.

Now, which of these options is correct?

But the question is about the decay via two dipole transitions. So the correct path must satisfy the selection rules for each step.

So all options A, B, C, D except perhaps D (because of the typo in the description) have valid transition steps.

But the question is about which transition route is correct and what is the probability.

Wait, the options specify the transition route and the corresponding probability. So the correct option must have a valid route and the correct probability.

So let's think about the possible probabilities.

The probability of each transition is determined by the square of the matrix element for each step.

But for hydrogen, the transition probability from an initial state |n, l, m⟩ to a final state |n', l', m'⟩ is proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient and the radial integral.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for the angular part is non-zero only if the selection rules are satisfied, which they are in all the options.

But the probabilities also depend on the possible m transitions. For the first transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1, m⟩, the possible m values are -1, 0, +1.

The probability for each m is the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for the transition from l=0 (s-state) to l=1 (p-state) are given by:

⟨1, m | 0,0⟩ ?

Wait, no, the initial state is l=0, so the angular part is Y_0^0. The dipole operator has components proportional to Y_1^m. So the matrix element is ∫ Y_0^0 Y_1^m* Y_l'^m' dΩ?

Wait, the dipole operator is proportional to r Y_1^m. So the matrix element for the transition is proportional to ⟨1,0 | Y_1^m | 3,0,0⟩, but perhaps I'm getting the direction mixed up.

Alternatively, the transition is from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1, m⟩. The matrix element for the dipole operator (say, the z-component) would involve an integral of Y_0^0 * Y_1^m * Y_1^0, because the initial state is l=0, and the dipole operator has l=1.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the possible m transitions. From |3,0,0⟩, the possible m transitions are m = 0 ±1, but since m_initial is 0, the possible m's are -1, 0, +1.

But since the initial state is spherically symmetric (l=0, m=0), when it interacts with the dipole operator (which has l=1), the matrix element for the transition depends on the overlap between Y_0^0 and Y_1^m. The integral ∫ Y_0^0 Y_1^m* dΩ is zero except when m=0, because Y_0^0 is symmetric, and Y_1^m has certain symmetries.

Wait, let me compute that integral. The integral of Y_0^0 Y_1^m* dΩ.

We know that Y_0^0 is (1/(2√π))^½. Y_1^m is proportional to (x ± iy) or something like that, depending on m.

But when m ≠ 0, the integral ∫ Y_0^0 Y_1^m dΩ = 0, because Y_1^m for m≠0 are not spherically symmetric. Only Y_1^0 is real and symmetric in a certain way. Wait, actually, when you multiply Y_0^0 (which is spherically symmetric) by Y_1^m (which for m≠0 has a specific angular dependence), the product will be an odd function under certain rotations, leading the integral to be zero.

Wait, more accurately, the integral ∫ Y_{l'}^{m'} * Y_{1}^{m} Y_{l}^{m''} dΩ is non-zero only if certain angular momentum coupling conditions are met. But in our case, l' is 0 (since initial state is l=0), l=1 (dipole operator), and the final state has l=1.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let's think differently. The initial state is |3,0,0⟩, and the dipole operator has components (like Y_1^0, Y_1^+1, Y_1^-1). So the matrix element ⟨2,1, m | er Y_1^m | 3,0,0⟩ would be non-zero only if m=0, because Y_0^0 is symmetric.

Wait, no, actually, the dipole operator has components that can change the angular momentum by ±1. Since the initial state is spherically symmetric (l=0), the only possible m after the transition are m=0, because when you integrate Y_0^0 multiplied by Y_1^m, the result is zero unless m=0.

Wait, let me compute the integral:

⟨1, m | Y_1^m | 0, 0⟩ = ∫ Y_1^m* Y_1^m Y_0^0 dΩ.

But Y_0^0 is 1/(2√π)^½. Y_1^m is proportional to sinθ e^{i m φ} or something like that.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The product Y_1^m * Y_0^0 is proportional to Y_1^m. Integrating over all solid angles, this would be zero unless m=0. Because Y_1^m for m≠0 are not symmetric in φ, so their integral over φ would be zero.

So the only non-zero matrix element is when m=0.

Wait, that would mean that the intermediate state after the first transition must have m=0. So |2,1,0⟩.

If that's the case, then the correct transition is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, which is option A.

So the probability would be the square of the matrix element for the first transition multiplied by the square of the matrix element for the second transition.

But wait, the first transition's matrix element is non-zero only for m=0, so the probability for that transition is from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,0⟩, and then from |2,1,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩.

So the overall probability would be the product of the two transition probabilities.

What's the probability for each step? For the first transition, the initial state is |3,0,0⟩, and the only allowed m is 0. So the probability for the first transition is the square of the matrix element for m=0. Since there are no other possibilities, the probability is 1 for the first transition, but wait, no. Because in reality, the initial state can transition to any of the possible m states, but in this case, only m=0 is allowed.

Wait, but if the initial state has l=0 and m=0, and the dipole operator allows transitions to m= -1, 0, +1, but in reality, due to the symmetry, only m=0 is possible. So the first transition can only go to |2,1,0⟩. Which means the transition probability is 100% for that step. Then the second transition is from |2,1,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩.

What about the second transition? The initial state is |2,1,0⟩, and the final is |1,0,0⟩. So m changes from 0 to 0 (Δm=0), and l changes from 1 to 0 (Δl=-1). So that's allowed.

What's the matrix element for that transition? Again, the dipole operator can cause a change in m by 0, ±1. So for the transition from |2,1,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩, the change in m is 0. So the matrix element is non-zero.

But what is the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for this? The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient ⟨0,0 | 1,0⟩ is 1, because 0,0 is obtained by combining 1,0 and 0,0 (since 0 is a possible value from 1 + 0).

Wait, but actually, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient ⟨0,0 | 1,0⟩ is 1. But I'm getting a bit confused here. Another way: when you have a state |1,0⟩, you can combine it with |0,0⟩ to get |0,0⟩. The coefficient is 1, I think.

So the matrix elements for the second transition would be non-zero, and the probability would be the square of that coefficient.

Wait, but the exact value depends on the radial integrals and the angular parts.

If the first transition's probability is 1 (since only m=0 is allowed), and the second transition's probability is some value, say P, then the overall probability would be P.

But the question is about the total probability of the decay via this two-step route.

Alternatively, perhaps each transition's probability is determined by the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

For the first transition from |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is 1 (since only m=0 is allowed), so the probability for this step is 1.

For the second transition, |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is also 1 (since it's a straightforward transition with Δl=-1 and Δm=0).

But wait, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for the angular part isn't enough; the radial part also matters. The radial integral for the dipole transition from 2,1,0 to 1,0,0 may not be zero, but the exact value would depend on the overlap of the radial wavefunctions.

But perhaps, for hydrogen, the probability for the transition from |n', l'=1, m'=0⟩ to |n''=n'-1, l''=0, m''=0⟩ is proportional to (n' - n'' ) something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the total probability for the process is the product of the probabilities for each step.

If the first step's probability is 1, and the second step's probability is some value, then the total would be that value.

But looking at the options, option A says the probability is 1/3, and option D says 2/3.

Wait, perhaps the total number of possible paths is 3 (since the first transition could have m=-1,0,+1, but in reality, only m=0 is allowed. Alternatively, maybe it's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Maybe the initial state |3,0,0⟩ can transition to any of the |2,1,m⟩ states (m=-1,0, +1) with certain probabilities, and then each of these can transition to |1,0,0⟩.

But earlier, I thought that only m=0 would have a non-zero matrix element because of the symmetry. But perhaps I was incorrect.

Wait, let me think about the matrix element again. The dipole operator has components like x, y, z, which are proportional to Y_1^1, Y_1^-1, Y_1^0.

So when the initial state is |3,0,0⟩ (Y_0^0), the transition to |2,1, m⟩ would occur via the matrix element involving Y_1^m.

Thus, the matrix element is:

⟨2,1,m | er Y_1^m | 3,0,0⟩ = 0 unless m=0?

Wait, because Y_0^0 multiplied by Y_1^m is only non-zero when m=0. Because when you multiply Y_0^0 (which is 1/(2√π)^½) by Y_1^m, the integral over all angles would be zero unless m=0.

Wait, actually, the integral ∫ Y_1^m*(θ,φ) Y_0^0 dΩ is zero unless m=0. Because Y_0^0 is symmetric, and Y_1^m for m≠0 are not symmetric under azimuthal rotations.

So yes, only m=0 for the first transition is allowed. So the first transition must go to |2,1,0⟩.

Then, the second transition from |2,1,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩.

So the only possible route is 3→2,1,0→1,0,0. So that's option A.

Now, what about the probability?

The probability would be the product of the probabilities of each transition. But perhaps the first transition is certain (probability 1), and the second transition has probability P.

But the question gives the total probability as 1/3, 1/4, 2/3, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability is determined by the possible ways the atom can decay through two steps, considering all possible intermediates.

Wait, but in this scenario, only the |2,1,0⟩ state is accessible in the first step.

So the total probability for this route is the product of each step's probability.

But wait, perhaps the first transition's probability is not 1. Maybe multiple m are allowed, but the matrix elements vary.

Wait, but earlier reasoning said only m=0 is allowed for the first transition.

So the first transition probability is 1 (since only one possibility), and the second transition's probability would be based on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient and the radial integral.

But I'm not exactly sure about the exact value.

Alternatively, perhaps the decay proceeds through all possible intermediates, but only the |2,1,0⟩ state is accessible. So the overall probability is the product.

But looking at the options, option A says the probability is 1/3. How?

Wait, perhaps the possible transition routes are from |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1, m⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, and each m has a certain probability. But earlier we thought that only m=0 is allowed. But perhaps I'm wrong, and all m are allowed but with different probabilities.

Wait, let's think about the dipole operator. The dipole operator has three components: x, y, z. Each component corresponds to a different m.

The matrix elements for the three possible transitions (m=-1, 0, +1) would be non-zero, but with different magnitudes.

Because the dipole operator in the z-direction (Y_1^0) will have a matrix element that's non-zero, and the x and y components (Y_1^±1) will also have non-zero matrix elements, but perhaps with different coefficients.

Wait, but the initial state is |3,0,0⟩, which is spherically symmetric. So when you apply the dipole operator, the resulting state has l=1, but the m values depend on the component of the dipole operator used.

So for the transition via the z-component (Y_1^0), you get m=0.

For the transition via the x-component (which is a combination of Y_1^1 and Y_1^-1), you might get both m=+1 and m=-1.

Hmm, perhaps the matrix elements for m=+1 and m=-1 are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign.

But the probabilities would then be the square of these matrix elements.

So the probability for the first transition to m=0 would be higher than for m=±1, perhaps.

Wait, let me think about the matrix elements more carefully.

The dipole operator can be written as:

r = r (x, y, z) = r (Y_1^1 + Y_1^-1 + Y_1^0) ?

Wait, no, the components are:

The vector spherical harmonics are Y_1^m, but the actual components are:

x = √(4π/3) Y_1^{-1} + √(4π/3) Y_1^{+1} }

Wait, no, perhaps I should recall that:

The position vector in spherical coordinates is given by:

r = a r (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ), where a is a scaling factor.

But the spherical harmonics Y_1^m are functions of θ and φ.

The components of the dipole operator can be expressed in terms of Y_1^m. So, for example:

e r = e (x, y, z) = e ( r sinθ cosφ, r sinθ sinφ, r cosθ )

Each component can be expressed as combinations of Y_1^m.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think about the transition dipole moment.

The transition dipole moment is given by:

⟨f | r | i⟩ = ∫ Y_{l_f}^{m_f}* Y_1^{m'} Y_{l_i}^{m_i} dΩ.

In our case, l_i = 0, m_i = 0.

So this reduces to:

⟨f | r | i⟩ = ∫ Y_{l_f}^{m_f}* Y_1^{m'} Y_0^0 dΩ.

Since Y_0^0 is 1/(2√π)^½, this simplifies to:

⟨f | r | i⟩ = ∫ Y_{l_f}^{m_f}* Y_1^{m'} dΩ * (1/(2√π)^½ ).

Which is non-zero only if the angular momentum coupling allows it. The integral is non-zero when l_f = l_i ± 1. Since l_i=0, l_f must be 1. Which aligns with our selection rules.

So for each m', the transition is possible when m_f = m_i + m', but since m_i=0, m_f = m'.

Wait, no, because the dipole operator can change m by m'.

So the matrix element is non-zero when m_f = m_i + m', where m' is the m of the dipole component. But in our case, m_i=0, so m_f = m'.

Thus, for each component of the dipole operator (m' = -1, 0, +1), the final state has m_f = m'.

So the possible m_f values are -1, 0, +1, each corresponding to a different component of the dipole operator.

But since the initial state is spherically symmetric, the matrix elements for each m' must be considered.

The matrix element for m' = 0 is ⟨2,1,0 | Y_1^0 |3,0,0⟩.

Similarly for m' = +1 and -1.

But the integral for m' = 0 is:

∫ Y_{1,0}^* Y_{1,0} Y_{0,0} dΩ.

Which is ∫ Y_{1,0}^* Y_{1,0} dΩ multiplied by Y_{0,0} (which is 1/(2√π)^½ ).

Wait, no, because Y_0^0 is a constant. So the integral becomes:

(1/(2√π)^½ ) ∫ Y_{1,0}^* Y_{1,0} dΩ.

But ∫ Y_{l m}^* Y_{l m} dΩ = 1, so the integral becomes (1/(2√π)^½ ) * 1.

Wait, but that can't be right because Y_{1,0} is not normalized in this way. Actually, the integral ∫ Y_{l m}^* Y_{l m} dΩ = 1.

But in our case, the matrix element for m'=0 is ∫ Y_{1,0}^* Y_{0,0} Y_{1,0} dΩ.

Wait, no, perhaps I should think about it differently. The initial state is Y_{0,0}, the dipole operator is proportional to Y_{1, m'}, and the final state is Y_{1, m_f}.

The matrix element is proportional to ∫ Y_{1, m_f}^* Y_{1, m'} Y_{0,0} dΩ.

But since Y_{0,0} is 1/(2√π)^½, this becomes:

(1/(2√π)^½ ) ∫ Y_{1, m_f}^* Y_{1, m'} dΩ.

Which is zero unless m_f = m' because the integral of Y_{1 m_f}^* Y_{1 m'} is zero unless m_f = m'.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The integral ∫ Y_{a}^* Y_{b} dΩ is zero unless a = b. Because the Y_{l m} are orthonormal.

So for each m', the integral is zero unless m_f = m'.

So, for each m', the matrix element is non-zero only if m_f = m'.

But in our transition, the first transition is from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1, m'⟩.

So m' can be -1, 0, +1, but the matrix element is non-zero only if m_f = m'.

So the possible m's are -1, 0, +1.

But wait, the initial state is |3,0,0⟩, and the dipole operator's components have m' = -1, 0, +1. So the matrix element is non-zero for each m', leading to transitions to |2,1, m'⟩.

But earlier, I thought that the matrix element would be zero for m'≠0 because of the integral involving Y_{1, m'} Y_{0,0}.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recast this.

The matrix element is:

⟨2,1,m' | er Y_1^{m'} |3,0,0⟩.

Which is proportional to ∫ Y_{1, m'}^* Y_{1, m'} Y_{0,0} dΩ.

Wait, that's not correct. The dipole operator is proportional to Y_{1, m'}, so the matrix element involves Y_{1, m'} multiplied by Y_{0,0}.

Wait, perhaps the correct expression is:

⟨2,1,m' | Y_{1, m'} | 3,0,0⟩.

Which is ∫ Y_{1, m'}^* Y_{1, m'} Y_{0,0} dΩ.

Wait, but that would be ∫ Y_{1, m'}^* Y_{1, m'} Y_{0,0} dΩ.

Y_{0,0} is 1/(2√π)^½, so:

(1/(2√π)^½) ∫ Y_{1, m'}^* Y_{1, m'} dΩ.

Which is (1/(2√π)^½ ) * ∫ |Y_{1, m'}|^2 dΩ.

But ∫ |Y_{1, m'}|^2 dΩ = 1, since they are orthonormal.

So the matrix element is (1/(2√π)^½ ) * 1.

Wait, but this would imply that the matrix element is the same for each m' (i.e., m' = -1, 0, +1), which would mean that each transition to |2,1, m'⟩ has the same probability.

But that can't be right because the actual values of Y_{1, m'} vary, and their products with Y_{0,0} might not be the same.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor here. Let me compute the actual integral for each m'.

The integral is ∫ Y_{1, m'}^* Y_{1, m'} Y_{0,0} dΩ.

But Y_{0,0} is 1/(2√π)^½, so it's a constant.

So the integral becomes (1/(2√π)^½ ) ∫ Y_{1, m'}^* Y_{1, m'} dΩ.

Which is (1/(2√π)^½ ) * 1, since Y_{1, m'} is normalized.

Thus, the matrix element is the same for each m', meaning that the transition probabilities to m' = -1, 0, +1 are the same.

Wait, but that doesn't align with the symmetry of the problem. Because the dipole operator's z-component (m'=0) is real and symmetric, whereas the x (m'=±1) components are complex conjugates.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again: the matrix element is proportional to the integral:

∫ Y_{1, m'}^* Y_{1, m'} Y_{0,0} dΩ.

But since Y_{0,0} is spherically symmetric, this integral is the same for all m', because Y_{1, m'}^* Y_{1, m'} is |Y_{1, m'}|^2, which depends only on θ and not φ. So the integral over φ would be ∫0^{2π} dφ, which is the same for all m'.

But wait, Y_{1, m'}^* Y_{1, m'} is |Y_{1, m'}|^2, which is a function of θ only, since Y_{1, m'} depends on θ and φ. For m' = 0, Y_{1,0} is proportional to cosθ. For m' = ±1, Y_{1, ±1} are proportional to sinθ e^{±iφ}.

So when you take Y_{1, m'}^* Y_{1, m'}, for m' = ±1, you get |Y_{1, ±1}|^2 = (sinθ)^2, same as for m'=0.

Wait, no: Y_{1,0} is proportional to cosθ, so its square is cos²θ.

Y_{1, ±1} are proportional to sinθ e^{±iφ}, so their squares are proportional to sin²θ, same as for m'=0.

So the integral ∫ |Y_{1, m'}|^2 Y_{0,0} dΩ is the same for all m'?

Wait, no. Because Y_{0,0} is 1/(2√π)^½, a constant. So the integral becomes (1/(2√π)^½ ) * ∫ |Y_{1, m'}|^2 dΩ.

But ∫ |Y_{1, m'}|^2 dΩ = 1 for each m'.

Thus, the matrix element would be the same for all m', implying that each transition (m' = -1, 0, +1) has the same probability.

But that doesn't seem right because the transition probabilities should depend on the specific matrix element.

Wait, but for the dipole operator, the transition probabilities for each m' should be the same, because the matrix elements for each are the same in magnitude.

So if that's the case, the first transition has three possible paths (m' = -1, 0, +1), each with equal probability.

So the probability for each first transition is 1/3.

Then, for each of these, the second transition is to |1,0,0⟩.

But the second transition's probability depends on the intermediate m'.

As discussed earlier, the second transition from |2,1,m'⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ is allowed only if m' can transition to m=0 via Δm=0, ±1.

So for each m' in the intermediate state:

- If m' = 0: Δm = 0 → allowed, and the matrix element is non-zero.

- If m' = +1: Δm = -1 → allowed.

- If m' = -1: Δm = +1 → allowed.

So each intermediate state can transition to the final state.

But the probability for each second transition depends on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients and the radial integrals.

Assuming the radial integrals are the same for all m', the probability for each second transition would be the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for the angular part.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining |1, m⟩ and |0,0⟩ to get |0,0⟩.

Wait, the state |0,0⟩ can be formed by combining |1,0⟩ and |0,0⟩.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient ⟨0,0 | 1,0; 0,0⟩ is 1, because you're adding l=1 and l=0.

Wait, no: the state |0,0⟩ can be formed by combining |1, m⟩ and |0,0⟩ only if m=0, because 1 + 0 = 1, and m=0 can give m_total=0.

So for each intermediate m', the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for the transition to |0,0⟩ is 1 when m' =0, and for m'=±1, it would be zero because you can't combine m=1 and m=0 to get m=0.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me think again.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient ⟨0,0 | 1, m'⟩ is zero unless m'=0. Because you're combining l=1 and l=0 to get l=0. So to get m=0, the only possibility is m' =0, because 0 + 0 =0.

So for m'=0, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is 1.

For m'=±1, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero because you can't combine m'=1 (from l=1) and m=0 (from l=0) to get m=0.

Wait, but that contradicts earlier reasoning. Did I get the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients wrong?

Wait, the state |0,0⟩ can be formed by combining |1,0⟩ and |0,0⟩. The coefficient is 1.

But for |1, m'⟩ where m'≠0, the combination can't contribute to |0,0⟩ because m' + 0 ≠0.

So, the transition from |2,1,m'⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ is allowed only if m'=0.

Thus, only the intermediate state with m'=0 can transition to the final state |1,0,0⟩.

Which means that the only possible path is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩.

Thus, the probability for the entire process is the product of the probabilities of each step.

The first step has a probability of 1/3 (since there are three equally likely m'= -1,0, +1 transitions), and the second step has a probability of 1 (since m'=0 can transition, others cannot).

Wait, but earlier I thought the first step's probabilities are equal for each m', which would be 1/3 each.

So the total probability for the entire decay is (1/3) * 1 = 1/3.

Which corresponds to option A: probability 1/3.

So the correct answer is option A.


The question involves the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state in the hydrogen atom to the |1,0,0⟩ state via two dipole transitions. The transitions are governed by the selection rules: Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. The decay proceeds through an intermediate state |2,1,m⟩, where m can be -1, 0, or +1. The probability of the overall decay depends on the allowed transitions and their respective probabilities.

### Key Analysis:
1. **First Transition (|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m⟩):**
   - The initial state |3,0,0⟩ has l=0, m=0. The dipole operator allows transitions to states with l=1 and m = -1, 0, +1.
   - The matrix elements for the transition depend on the overlap of the spherical harmonics. For a spherically symmetric initial state (l=0), the transition probabilities to m = -1, 0, +1 are equal due to symmetry considerations.
   - Thus, the probability for each m is 1/3.

2. **Second Transition (|2,1,m⟩ → |1,0,0⟩):**
   - The intermediate state |2,1,m⟩ transitions to the final state |1,0,0⟩. The selection rules require Δl = -1 and Δm = 0, ±1.
   - For the transition to occur, the intermediate state must have m = 0. This is because the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient ⟨0,0 | 1,m⟩ is non-zero only when m = 0. States with m = ±1 cannot transition to |1,0,0⟩.

3. **Overall Probability:**
   - The first transition to |2,1,0⟩ has a probability of 1/3 (since there are three equally likely m values: -1, 0, +1).
   - The second transition from |2,1,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ is certain (probability = 1), as it satisfies the selection rules.
   - The total probability for the decay is the product of the probabilities of the two transitions:  
     \[
     \text{Total Probability} = \frac{1}{3} \times 1 = \frac{1}{3}.
     \]

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A:** |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/3. This matches the analysis.
- **Option B:** |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/4. This is incorrect because the intermediate state |2,1,1⟩ cannot transition to |1,0,0⟩.
- **Option C:** |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/4. This is also incorrect because the intermediate state |2,1,-1⟩ cannot transition to |1,0,0⟩.
- **Option D:** |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 2/3. This is incorrect because the probability is not 2/3.

### Conclusion:
The correct transition route is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with a total probability of 1/3.
