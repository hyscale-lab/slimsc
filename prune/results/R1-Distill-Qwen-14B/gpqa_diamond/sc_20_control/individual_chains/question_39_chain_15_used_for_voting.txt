Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question involves wave functions and normalization, I think. Let me read through the problem again.

So, we have an ensemble of 10,000 identical systems. Each system has a particle that's the same and under the same conditions. Each particle moves along a tube, the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, where i is the square root of -1. When measuring the position, none were found at x < 1 or x > 3. So the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3.

The question is asking for the numerical value of 'a'. The options are A) 1.1, B) 0.85, C) 0.35, D) 0.6.

Wait, wave functions in quantum mechanics are usually complex, but for normalization, the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space must equal 1. Oh right, the normalization condition. So the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The way it's written, I think it's actually (a / sqrt(1+x)) times (1 - 0.5i), but maybe that's not the case. No, the way it's written is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Wait, maybe that's a typo and it's (a / sqrt(1+x)) multiplied by (1 - 0.5i). Hmm, but the way it's written is subtraction. Hmm, but in quantum mechanics, the wave function is typically a complex function, so perhaps it's better to think that the expression is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by (1 - 0.5i). Because otherwise, if it's a real term minus an imaginary term, that would be a complex function.

Wait, maybe I should just proceed with the given expression. So ψ(x) = [a / sqrt(1+x)] - 0.5i. So the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So to write it as a complex number, it's (a/(sqrt(1+x))) + (-0.5)i.

But wait, if that's the case, then the wave function has a constant imaginary part. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I misread it. Maybe the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by (1 - 0.5i). Because that would make more sense as a standard form for a wave function, combining a real and imaginary component.

But the way it's written in the question is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, so perhaps it's (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by (1 + (-0.5i)). Or perhaps it's (a/(sqrt(1 + x))) + (-0.5)i. Either way, the modulus squared would involve both terms.

Wait, but let's think about normalization. The normalization condition is the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 equals 1. Because the particle is only found between x=1 and x=3, so the wave function is zero outside that region. Wait, but the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the wave function is non-zero only between 1 and 3. So the normalization integral is from 1 to 3.

So to compute |ψ(x)|², which is ψ*(x) * ψ(x). Let me write ψ(x) as ψ(x) = A(x) + B(x) i, where A is real and B is real. So ψ*(x) is A(x) - B(x) i. So |ψ|² = [A(x)^2 + B(x)^2].

In this case, A(x) is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and B(x) is -0.5. So |ψ(x)|² = [ (a/(sqrt(1+x)))^2 + (0.5)^2 ] = [ a²/(1+x) ) + 0.25 ].

Wait no, wait. Because B(x) is -0.5, so B(x)^2 is (0.5)^2. So yeah, it's (a²/(1+x) ) + 0.25.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

So that's the equation we need to solve for 'a'. Let's compute that integral.

Let me split the integral into two parts: integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3, plus integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3.

The first integral is a² * ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to 3. Because ∫1/(1+x) dx = ln(1+x) + C.

So a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ] = a² ln(2).

The second integral is 0.25*(3 - 1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So the total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 ) = 1.

So, a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Subtracting 0.5: a² ln(2) = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Then a is the square root of 0.7213, which is approximately 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is close. So the correct answer is B) 0.85.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make any mistakes in the calculation? Let me double-check.

The wave function is ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So ψ*(x) ψ(x) = [a/sqrt(1+x)]^2 + (0.5)^2. So yes, that gives a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

Integrating from 1 to 3:

Integral [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = a² ln(4/2) + 0.25*(3-1) = a² ln(2) + 0.5.

Set equal to 1: a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2) ≈ 0.7213 → a ≈ 0.849, which is about 0.85. So option B is correct.

To determine the value of \( a \), we use the normalization condition for the wave function. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The normalization condition requires that the integral of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over the region where the particle exists (i.e., \( x \in [1, 3] \)) equals 1. For a complex wave function \( \psi(x) = A(x) + B(x)i \), the modulus squared is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = A(x)^2 + B(x)^2
\]

Here, \( A(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} \) and \( B(x) = -0.5 \), so:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

The normalization condition is:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx + \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 dx = 1
\]

1. **First integral**:  
   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \ln(1+x) \Big|_{1}^{3} = a^2 [\ln(4) - \ln(2)] = a^2 \ln(2)
   \]

2. **Second integral**:  
   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 dx = 0.25 (3-1) = 0.5
   \]

Combining these results:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849
\]

The closest option to this value is \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Wait, but let's think about normalization. The normalization condition is the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 equals 1. Because the particle is only found between x=1 and x=3, so the wave function is zero outside that region. Wait, but the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the wave function is non-zero only between 1 and 3. So the normalization integral is from 1 to 3.

So to compute |ψ(x)|², which is ψ*(x) * ψ(x). Let me write ψ(x) as ψ(x) = A(x) + B(x) i, where A is real and B is real. So ψ*(x) is A(x) - B(x) i. So |ψ|² = [A(x)^2 + B(x)^2].

In this case, A(x) is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and B(x) is -0.5. So |ψ(x)|² = [ (a/(sqrt(1+x)))^2 + (0.5)^2 ] = [ a²/(1+x) ) + 0.25 ].

Wait no, wait. Because B(x) is -0.5, so B(x)^2 is (0.5)^2. So yeah, it's (a²/(1+x) ) + 0.25.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

So that's the equation we need to solve for 'a'. Let's compute that integral.

Let me split the integral into two parts: integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3, plus integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3.

The first integral is a² * ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to 3. Because ∫1/(1+x) dx = ln(1+x) + C.

So a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ] = a² ln(2).

The second integral is 0.25*(3 - 1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So the total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 ) = 1.

So, a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Subtracting 0.5: a² ln(2) = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Then a is the square root of 0.7213, which is approximately 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is close. So the correct answer is B) 0.85.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make any mistakes in the calculation? Let me double-check.

The wave function is ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So ψ*(x) ψ(x) = [a/sqrt(1+x)]^2 + (0.5)^2. So yes, that gives a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

Integrating from 1 to 3:

Integral [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = a² ln(4/2) + 0.25*(3-1) = a² ln(2) + 0.5.

Set equal to 1: a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2) ≈ 0.7213 → a ≈ 0.849, which is about 0.85. So option B is correct.


To determine the value of \( a \), we use the normalization condition for the wave function. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The normalization condition requires that the integral of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over the region where the particle exists (i.e., \( x \in [1, 3] \)) equals 1. For a complex wave function \( \psi(x) = A(x) + B(x)i \), the modulus squared is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = A(x)^2 + B(x)^2
\]

Here, \( A(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} \) and \( B(x) = -0.5 \), so:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

The normalization condition is:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx + \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 dx = 1
\]

1. **First integral**:  
   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \ln(1+x) \Big|_{1}^{3} = a^2 [\ln(4) - \ln(2)] = a^2 \ln(2)
   \]

2. **Second integral**:  
   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 dx = 0.25 (3-1) = 0.5
   \]

Combining these results:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849
\]

The closest option to this value is \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.
