Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles in a detector. Hmm, I need to find the Lorentz factor required for two-thirds of the particles to reach the inner walls, given that with a Lorentz factor of about 20, only one-third reach the walls. 

Wait, I remember that Lorentz factor gamma is related to time dilation and length contraction in relativity. Since the particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, time dilation probably plays a role here. Oh right, because from the lab frame (the detector's frame), the particles' lifetimes would be longer due to the Lorentz factor. 

The detector's radius is 30 meters. So the particles are produced at the center, and they need to travel 30 meters to reach the wall. The time they have to travel that distance depends on their speed, which is related to gamma. 

Let me think about the proper lifetime of the particles. The proper time (tau) is the lifetime as measured in the particle's rest frame. From the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma times tau. So the time available for the particle to travel is gamma * tau. 

The distance the particle travels is speed multiplied by time. The speed of the particle is c times beta (since beta is v/c). So the distance is beta * c * gamma * tau. Wait, but beta times gamma is (v/c) * gamma. Hmm, what's beta gamma in terms of gamma? 

Wait, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta²). So beta is sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). Alternatively, beta can be approximated for large gamma as approximately 1 because at high speeds, beta is very close to 1. But wait, in this case, gamma is 20, which is high but not extremely so. Wait, but for gamma around 20, beta is like sqrt(1 - (1/400)) which is sqrt(399/400) which is about sqrt(0.9975) ≈ 0.9987, so beta is close to 1. So beta is approximately 1 for gamma as low as 20. So perhaps in this problem, beta is taken as approximately 1. That would simplify things.

So if I approximate beta as 1, then the distance the particle travels is c * gamma * tau. But wait, no, because the distance is v * t, and t is gamma tau. So v is beta c, so (beta c) * (gamma tau) = beta gamma c tau. But beta is approximately 1, so it's gamma c tau. 

Wait, but the detector has a radius R. So for a particle to reach the wall, the distance it needs to travel is R. So the condition is that the particle's lifetime multiplied by its speed equals R. 

Wait, no, the time the particle has is its lifetime, which from the lab frame is gamma tau. So the distance it travels is v * gamma tau. So we have v gamma tau = R. But v is beta c, so beta c gamma tau = R. 

But if beta is approximately 1, then c gamma tau ≈ R. So tau ≈ R/(c gamma). 

Wait, but the problem states that with gamma =20, about one-third of the particles reach the detector walls. So for those that reach, their lifetime is such that their speed multiplied by their lifetime is equal to the radius. But some particles don't make it because they decay before reaching the wall.

Wait, but the number that reach depends on the exponential decay. The probability that a particle survives to reach the wall is exp(-t/(tau)), where t is the time it takes to reach the wall. 

Wait, wait, the proper lifetime is tau. From the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau. So the time the particle has to travel is t = R/(v) = R/(beta c). But from the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau. So the particle will reach the wall only if t is less than the lifetime. But actually, the survival probability is given by the exponential decay law: P = exp(-t/(gamma tau)), since the particle's lifetime is gamma tau in the lab frame.

Wait, that makes sense. So the probability that a particle hasn't decayed when it reaches the wall is exp(-t/(gamma tau)) where t is R/(beta c). So if t is less than gamma tau, then P is greater than zero.

Wait, no, the probability that the particle decays before reaching the wall is 1 - exp(-t/(gamma tau)). Hmm, wait, the survival probability is exp(-t/(gamma tau)), since the decay is memoryless. So the fraction that reach is exp(-t/(gamma tau)).

In the initial case, when gamma is 20, one third of the particles reach the wall. So exp(-t/(20 tau)) = 1/3.

Wait, let me write that equation. 

For gamma_1 = 20:

P1 = exp(-t/(gamma_1 tau)) = 1/3.

We can write this as:

exp(-t/(20 tau)) = 1/3.

We take the natural logarithm of both sides:

- t/(20 tau) = ln(1/3) = -ln(3).

So t/(20 tau) = ln(3).

Thus, t = 20 tau ln(3).

But t is the time it takes the particle to reach the wall, which is R/(v) = R/(beta c). So t = R/(beta c) = 20 tau ln(3).

Wait, but if beta is approximately 1, then R/(c) = 20 tau ln(3). So tau = R/(c * 20 ln(3)).

But we can express tau in terms of R and the given gamma. Let me see.

Alternatively, since we're looking for a new gamma, gamma_2, where the probability is 2/3, we can set up a similar equation.

For gamma_2:

P2 = exp(-t/(gamma_2 tau)) = 2/3.

Again, t is R/(beta c), but since beta is approximately 1, t ≈ R/(c).

So,

exp(-R/(c gamma_2 tau)) ) = 2/3.

Taking the natural logarithm:

- R/(c gamma_2 tau) ) = ln(2/3).

Multiply both sides by -1:

R/(c gamma_2 tau) ) = - ln(2/3) = ln(3/2).

So,

R/(c gamma_2 tau) ) = ln(3/2).

But from the first equation, we have R/(c gamma_1 tau) ) = ln(3), as gamma_1 is 20.

Wait, let me double-check.

Wait, from the first case:

t = R/(beta c) = R/(c) since beta≈1.

So,

P1 = exp(- t/(gamma_1 tau) ) = 1/3.

So,

exp( - R/(c * gamma_1 tau) ) = 1/3.

Therefore,

- R/(c gamma_1 tau) ) = ln(1/3) = - ln 3.

So,

R/(c gamma_1 tau) = ln 3.

Similarly, for the second case:

exp( - R/(c gamma_2 tau) ) = 2/3.

Which gives:

- R/(c gamma_2 tau) ) = ln(2/3) = - ln(3/2).

So,

R/(c gamma_2 tau) ) = ln(3/2).

Now, since R and tau are the same in both cases (same particles, same detector), we can take the ratio of the two equations.

From the first case:

R/(c gamma_1 tau) = ln3.

From the second case:

R/(c gamma_2 tau) = ln(3/2).

Dividing the second equation by the first gives:

[ R/(c gamma_2 tau) ] / [ R/(c gamma_1 tau) ) ] = [ ln(3/2) ] / [ ln3 ]

Simplify:

( gamma_1 / gamma_2 ) = [ ln(3/2) ] / [ ln3 ]

So,

gamma_2 = gamma_1 * [ ln3 / ln(3/2) ]

Let me compute that.

Compute ln(3) and ln(3/2). Let's see, ln(3) ≈ 1.0986. ln(3/2) ≈ 0.4055.

So,

gamma_2 ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055 ) ≈ 20 * (2.709) ≈ 54.18.

Looking at the options, option A is 54. So gamma_2 is approximately 54. 

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the steps.

We have the same R and tau in both cases. The ratio of the equations gives the gamma ratio. So I think this approach is correct. So the needed gamma is approximately 54, which is option A.

To solve the problem, we analyze the relationship between the Lorentz factor, the survival probability of the particles, and the geometry of the detector. The particles are produced at the center of a spherical detector with radius \( R = 30 \, \text{m} \). The probability of a particle reaching the detector walls depends on its lifetime and the time it takes to travel the distance \( R \). The survival probability is given by the exponential decay formula:

\[
P = \exp\left(-\frac{t}{\gamma \tau}\right),
\]

where \( t \) is the time it takes for the particle to reach the wall, \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle, and \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor. The time \( t \) is approximately \( R / c \) (since \( \beta \approx 1 \) for ultra-relativistic particles).

### Step 1: Relating the two scenarios
For the initial case with \( \gamma_1 = 20 \), one-third of the particles reach the wall, so:

\[
P_1 = \exp\left(-\frac{R}{c \gamma_1 \tau}\right) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm:

\[
-\frac{R}{c \gamma_1 \tau} = \ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\ln(3).
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{R}{c \gamma_1 \tau} = \ln(3).
\]

For the second case, where two-thirds of the particles reach the wall, we have:

\[
P_2 = \exp\left(-\frac{R}{c \gamma_2 \tau}\right) = \frac{2}{3}.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm:

\[
-\frac{R}{c \gamma_2 \tau} = \ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right).
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{R}{c \gamma_2 \tau} = \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right).
\]

### Step 2: Relating \( \gamma_1 \) and \( \gamma_2 \)
Dividing the two equations:

\[
\frac{\frac{R}{c \gamma_2 \tau}}{\frac{R}{c \gamma_1 \tau}} = \frac{\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)}{\ln(3)}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\frac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_2} = \frac{\ln(3)}{\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)}.
\]

Rearranging for \( \gamma_2 \):

\[
\gamma_2 = \gamma_1 \cdot \frac{\ln(3)}{\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)}.
\]

### Step 3: Numerical computation
Using approximate values:
- \( \ln(3) \approx 1.0986 \),
- \( \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) \approx 0.4055 \),

we compute:

\[
\gamma_2 = 20 \cdot \frac{1.0986}{0.4055} \approx 20 \cdot 2.709 \approx 54.18.
\]

### Step 4: Final answer
The closest option to \( \gamma_2 \approx 54.18 \) is **54**, which corresponds to option **A**.
