Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let me read it again. The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product after a reaction. The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, and it's reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI.

Hmm, I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency is also called the degree of unsaturation. It's calculated using the formula: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = [2C + 2 - H - X + N]/2. Where C is the number of carbons, H is hydrogens, X is halogens, and N is nitrogens. But wait, in this problem, I don't see any halogens or nitrogens mentioned, so X and N are zero.

The reaction involves red phosphorus and excess HI. Oh right, that's the reaction for the hydrolysis of a nitrile, but wait, no, wait. Red phosphorus with HI is used for the dehydrohalogenation or maybe for the elimination of HX from certain compounds. Or wait, wait, another thought: when you have an alkyne and treat it with red phosphorus and HI, it gets converted into a diol. Or wait, no, maybe that's with something else. Alternatively, I think red phosphorus and HI are used for the substitution of multiple bonds, like adding HI across double or triple bonds.

But wait, the starting material: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let me draw its structure. So cyclohexene ring, with substituents at positions 2, 3, and 5. At position 2, there's a formyl group (CHO). At position 5, a vinyl group (CH₂CH₂?), wait, no, vinyl is CH₂=CH-. So, the structure is a cyclohexene ring (since there's a 'cyclohex-en' in the name) with a double bond at position 3, I think. Wait, the name is cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the cyclohexene has a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. 

So the structure is a cyclohexene ring with a carboxylic acid group at position 1 (since it's cyclohexene carboxylic acid, the numbering is such that the substituents are at positions 2, 3 (the double bond), and 5. So position 2 has a formyl group, position 5 has a vinyl group (CH₂=CH- attached to the ring), and the ring has a double bond between 3 and 4.

Wait, the name is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the cyclohexene has a double bond between 3 and 4. The carboxylic acid is at position 1, formyl at position 2, and vinyl at position 5.

Now, the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. What does that reaction do? I think when you have a conjugated diene, red phosphorus and HI can lead to the dihydroxylation, but wait, no, that's with other reagents like H2O2 and acid. Alternatively, HI can add across triple bonds, but this molecule doesn't have any. Wait, maybe the reaction is adding HI to the double bonds.

Wait, the starting molecule has two double bonds: the cyclohexene ring (so one double bond) and the vinyl group (another double bond, the CH₂=CH- part). So two double bonds in total. So, when treated with HI, which is a strong acid, and red phosphorus, which I think is used for the reaction where it facilitates the addition of HX across double bonds, perhaps in a way that breaks the double bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a diaddition of HI to each double bond. So each double bond would add two H and I atoms, but wait, with red phosphorus, I remember it's used in the reaction where phosphorus reacts with HI to produce HPH3 and I2, which then can add to the triple bonds. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, another thought: red phosphorus and HI in a reaction called the hydroxylation or maybe the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation? No, that's different. Or perhaps it's a reaction where the triple bonds are converted into other structures.

Wait, maybe the reaction is for the addition of HI to double bonds. For each double bond, adding HI would lead to addition across the double bond, converting each double bond into a single bond. So each double bond (two of them) would each get two H and I added. Let's think: each double bond addition would reduce the number of double bonds by one, and hence change the degree of unsaturation.

Wait, but in the starting molecule, the cyclohexene has one double bond, and the vinyl group has another. So two double bonds in the molecule. So the initial degree of unsaturation is 2 (from two double bonds) plus any rings. Wait, the cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with a double bond, so that's one ring and one double bond, making a total of two degrees of unsaturation from the ring (since a ring is one DoU) and one from the double bond, so that's three for the ring part. Wait, no, wait. The degree of unsaturation for a cyclohexene is calculated as follows: a cyclohexane is 1 DoU (the ring), and the double bond adds another, so cyclohexene has two DoU. But when you have substituents like the formyl and vinyl groups, which have their own DoU.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the DoU of the starting compound first. Let me do that.

The starting material: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

Let's count the carbons. The cyclohexene ring has 6 carbons. The formyl group is CHO (1 carbon, but part of the ring so 6 + 1 (from formyl) + 2 (from vinyl CH₂CH₂? Wait, no, the vinyl group is CH₂=CH-, so that's two more carbons attached to the ring. Wait, the ring is cyclohexene, so 6 carbons. Then the formyl is at position 2 (so another carbon), and the vinyl is at position 5, which is CH₂=CH-, so that's two more carbons. Wait, but the vinyl group is attached to the ring, so the structure is like:

Ring: C1 (COOH), C2 (CHO), C3 and C4 (double bond between them), C5 (CH₂-CH₂?), wait no, vinyl is CH₂=CH- attached to the ring. So the substituents are:

- C1: COOH (carboxylic acid)
- C2: CHO (formyl)
- C5: CH₂-CH₂? Wait, no, the vinyl group is CH₂=CH-, attached to the ring. So the structure is the cyclohexene ring with substituents at C2 (CHO), C5 (CH₂=CH-), and the double bond between C3 and C4.

So the formula for this molecule: let's see.

The cyclohexene part: C6H8O (for cyclohexene, but wait, cyclohexene is C6H10, but with substituents, it's getting more complex. Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula is better thought of as the sum of all parts.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the molecular formula first. Let's see:

The parent ring is cyclohexene (C6H10). Then, the substituents are:

- At C2: a formyl group (CHO) which adds 1 O, 1 C, and 1 O.
Wait, but CHO is CHO, so adding 1 C, 1 O, and no H (since it's replacing a H on the ring).

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of counting each substituent.

Alternatively, the molecular formula can be constructed as follows:

The cyclohexene ring: C6H10.

Each substituent adds to this.

At C2: formyl (CHO) adds -CHO. So the formula becomes C7H9O.

At C5: vinyl group (CH₂=CH-) adds two more carbons and two more hydrogens (since in the vinyl group, it's -CH₂CH₂- but with a double bond, so perhaps actually, it's attached as CH₂=CH-). So how does that affect the formula? The ring has a substituent at C5: -CH₂CH₂- but with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. So the substituent is -CH₂CH₂ (but wait, that's not correct. The vinyl group is -CH₂-CH₂- with a double bond, so it's -CH₂=CH2? No, wait, the vinyl group is CH₂=CH-, so when attached to the ring, it's like R-CH₂-CH₂? No, the structure is R-CH₂-CH₂? No, wait, the vinyl group is CH₂=CH- attached to another carbon. So perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group, which would contribute two carbons and two hydrogens (since the substituent is -CH₂-CH₂-, but with a double bond, so we have -CH₂-CH₂- but with a double bond, so it's -CH₂=CH- attached to the ring. So the substituent adds two carbons and three hydrogens? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think: each vinyl group is -CH₂-CH₂- but with a double bond, so it's actually -CH₂-CH₂- with a double bond between the two adjacent carbons. So each vinyl group would have two carbons and two hydrogens attached (since the double bond reduces the number of H).

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this differently. The parent ring is cyclohexene: C6H10.

Each substituent:

- Formyl group (CHO): adds 1 C, 1 O, and replaces a hydrogen on the ring. So the formula becomes C7 H9 O.

- Vinyl group (CH₂=CH-): adds 2 C, 3 H (since each substituent was replacing a H, but the double bond reduces the H count). Let's see: each vinyl group is -CH₂-CH₂- but with a double bond, so it's -CH₂=CH- attached to the ring. So for the substituent, the ring loses one H (since it's attached to the substituent), and the substituent brings in two C and three H (since the vinyl group is CH₂=CH-, which has 4 H in total: CH2 has two H on first C, and CH has one H on second C.) Wait, no: CH₂=CH- has two H on the first C (CH₂), and one H on the second C (CH). So total of 3 H in the substituent. But when attached to the ring, the substituent is -CH₂-CH₂- but with a double bond, so the structure is -CH₂=CH2? No, the substituent is -CH₂-CH₂- with a double bond, so perhaps the substituent is -CH₂-CH₂- but with a double bond, making it -CH₂=CH- attached to the ring. So the substituent has two C, and the H count: the substituent is CH₂=CH-, which gives two C and three H (two from CH₂, one from CH).

But wait, when the substituent is attached, the ring's H count is adjusted. Let's think about the molecular formula.

Parent: C6H10.

Each substituent:

- Formyl (CHO): replaces one H, so adds 1 C, 1 O, and 0 H.

- Vinyl (CH₂=CH-): replaces another H, so adds 2 C, 3 H.

So the formula would be:

C: 6 + 1 (CHO) + 2 (vinyl) = 9 C.

H: 10 (from cyclohexene) - 2 (two H replaced by substituents) + (CHO adds 0 H, vinyl adds 3 H) = 10 - 2 +3 = 11 H.

O: 1 (from the carboxylic acid group COOH) + 1 (from CHO) = 2 O.

Wait, but the substituent at position 5 is vinyl (CH₂=CH-), so the substituent has three H: the first CH₂ has two H, and the second CH has one H. So adding three H.

So the formula is C9 H11 O2.

Wait, but wait, the carboxylic acid group is -COOH, which is at position 1. So the formula would be:

- C: 6 (ring) + 1 (CHO) + 2 (vinyl) = 9 C.

- H: 10 (ring) - 3 (since we have three substituents: COOH, CHO, vinyl. Wait, no, the substituents are at positions 2,5, and the double bond is part of the ring. Wait, the substituents are at positions 2 (CHO), 5 (vinyl), and the carboxylic acid is at position 1. So that's three substituents, each replacing a H. So each substituent replaces a H, so total H is 10 (ring) minus 3 (substituents) = 7. Then, the substituents add their own H: CHO has 0 (since it's CHO, which is a carbonyl, so structure is C=O, so the substituent is attached as R-CHO, which has one H in the aldehyde group. Wait, no, R-CHO would have one H (the aldehyde H), so that's an additional H. Vinyl substituent has three H as I thought earlier. And the COOH group has two O and a certain number of H.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe another approach: let me calculate the degree of unsaturation of the starting material first.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

Formula: Let's see.

Cyclohexene is C6H10. Then, substituents:

- At C1: COOH (which is -COOH, so that's adding one more O and another O, but for the formula, it's a substituent that replaces a H on the ring. So each substituent is replacing a H.

Each substituent:

- COOH: adds (COOH has formula -COOH, which is C O2 H2 O? Wait, no, the COOH group is -C(=O)OH, which is O2 and H2O? Wait, no: the formula is CnH2nO2 for a carboxylic acid. But in the substituent, it's -COOH, which is -C(O)OH, so for each substituent, it's adding one C, two O, and two H (since the -COOH adds two more H than what was there before, but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to count all the atoms.

Let me think: the molecule is a cyclohexene ring (6 C), with a carboxylic acid group at position 1, a formyl group at position 2, and a vinyl group at position 5.

So the substituents are:

1. Carboxylic acid (COOH): adds one C, two O, and the formula for that group is COOH, which is -C(O)OH. So in terms of H, the ring's H is replaced, so the substituent brings in two H (the OH and the H on the carbonyl?). No, wait, the COOH group is -C(O)OH, which has (O) in the carbonyl and an -OH. The H on the carbonyl is a double bond, so no H. Wait, the structure is R-C-O-OH? No, actually, the carboxylic acid is R-COOH, so it's -C(O)OH.

The substituent at C1 is -COOH, so for the molecular formula, it adds one more C and two more O, and the H count? Let's see: the original ring has 10 H. The substituent at position 1 is -COOH, which has two O and a formula of COOH. The COOH group has two more O and requires two H: but wait, the COOH group is -C(O)OH, which is:

The structure is R-C(O)OH. So the formula for the substituent is C(O)OH, which is one C, two O, and two H (the H from the -OH and the H in the -COOH group? Wait, no, the -COOH group has two H: one in the -OH and one in the -COOH (from the O-H, but the C=O has no H. So the substituent brings in two H (the O-H and the H attached to the C? No, wait, the COOH group is -C(O)OH. So the substituent is -C(O)OH, which has the formula COOH, which is O2 and H2O?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to calculate the molecular formula as follows:

- The base is cyclohexene: C6H10.

- Each substituent:

   a) COOH at C1: adds 1 C, 2 O, and 2 H (since the COOH is -COOH, which has two O and two H: the H from the OH and the H from the COOH's structure? Wait, not sure. Alternatively, the substituent is -COOH, which contributes 2 O and 2 H.

   b) CHO at C2: adds 1 C, 1 O, and 1 H (the aldehyde H).

   c) Vinyl group at C5: adds 2 C, 3 H, and 1 O? Wait, no, vinyl is CH₂=CH-, which doesn't add O. Wait, the vinyl group is CH₂=CH-, so it's two C and three H (as the substituent).

Wait, perhaps I should approach this more systematically.

The molecular formula is calculated by:

Each substituent will add to the base formula, which is cyclohexene (C6H10).

Each substituent replaces one H on the ring.

So for each substituent, we subtract one H from the base.

Now, the substituents:

1. COOH at C1: adds 1 C, 2 O, and 2 H (since COOH is -COOH, which has two O and the H from the OH group. Wait, but in the substituent, the COOH is attached to the ring, so the ring's C has the substituent. So the substituent brings:

- 1 C (the COOH's C, which is the same as the ring's C?), wait no. Wait, the ring's C already has a substituent. So the COOH is a substituent on the ring, so the formula becomes C6H10 → adding COOH (C(O)OH) would add 2 O and 2 H. But the ring's C is already part of the ring, so COOH adds one more C. So the formula becomes C7 H10-1 + 2 H (since COOH has two H in the -OH and the aldehyde H? I'm getting confused again.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula is C9 H10 O3.

Wait, maybe I should just count all atoms.

The molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

So, the structure is:

- A six-membered cyclohexene ring (so one ring, one double bond), with substituents at positions 1 (COOH), 2 (CHO), and 5 (CH₂=CH-).

So:

Carbon count:
- 6 (ring) + 1 (COOH) + 1 (CHO) + 2 (vinyl) = 10 C.

Wait, no: the COOH is at position 1, CHO at 2, and vinyl at 5. So the ring is 6 C, substituents add 1 (COOH, which is one C) + 1 (CHO, another C) + 2 (vinyl, two C). So total C is 6 + 1 +1 +2 = 10 C.

Hydrogen count:

The base cyclohexene has 10 H. Each substituent replaces one H, so subtract 3 (for three substituents), so 10 -3=7 H. Then, the substituents add their own H.

- COOH: contributes two H (the -OH and the aldehyde H? No, wait, the COOH is -C(O)OH, so the substituent brings two H (the H in the -OH group and another H from where? The carbonyl is a double bond, so no H there. So COOH substituent adds two H.

- CHO: the substituent is an aldehyde, which is -CHO. The substituent has one H (the aldehyde H).

- Vinyl: substituent is -CH₂=CH-. The substituent has three H (the two from CH₂ and one from CH).

So substituents add 2 (COOH) + 1 (CHO) + 3 (vinyl) = 6 H. So total H is 7 (from ring) +6 =13 H.

Oxygen count:

COOH has two O (from COOH), CHO has one O, and any from the ring? The ring doesn't contribute O. So O = 2 +1 =3 O.

So the molecular formula is C10 H13 O3.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me recheck. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is C9 H10 O3.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of it another way. The starting material has how many double bonds and rings?

The ring itself contributes one degree of unsaturation (the ring), the double bond in the ring contributes another (so two from the ring part). Then, the vinyl substituent has a double bond, contributing another degree, and the formyl group (CHO) has a double bond (C=O), contributing another degree. So total degrees of unsaturation: ring (1) + ring double bond (1) + vinyl double bond (1) + formyl double bond (1) = 4 degrees of unsaturation.

Wait, but wait: the formyl group is -CHO, which has a carbonyl group (C=O), which is a double bond, so that's one DoU.

The vinyl group is CH₂=CH-, which is a double bond, another DoU.

The ring has a double bond (cyclohexene), which is another DoU, and the ring itself is a cyclic structure, another DoU. So total DoU is 4.

So initial DoU is 4.

Now, the reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI. What happens here?

Red phosphorus and HI is a known reagent for the hydration of alkynes to form ketones, but wait, that's when using HgSO4 as a catalyst. Alternatively, I think that red phosphorus and HI can be used to add HI across triple bonds, but in this case, the starting material doesn't have a triple bond. Alternatively, I think that this reaction is for the addition of HI to double bonds in a way that breaks the double bonds.

Wait, another thought: red phosphorus and HI can lead to the dihydroxylation of triple bonds, but I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps I should think about what happens when you have a conjugated diene and use red phosphorus and HI. Or perhaps in this case, the reaction is adding HI across each double bond.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed addition of HI to each double bond. But in this case, the starting molecule has two double bonds: the ring's double bond and the vinyl group's double bond.

So when HI is added to each double bond, each double bond would be converted into a single bond, adding two H and I across each. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydrohalogenation, adding HI to each double bond.

Wait, but in the presence of excess HI and red phosphorus, it's possible that all double bonds are saturated.

If each double bond adds two H (each from HI), then each double bond would be converted into a single bond. So the number of double bonds would decrease by two, reducing the DoU by 2.

Wait, but adding HI to a double bond would add two H and two I, but to each double bond. Each addition would convert a double bond into a single bond, so each such addition would reduce the DoU by one (since a double bond is one DoU). So if there are two double bonds, adding HI to both would reduce the DoU by two.

So the initial DoU is 4. After reaction, it's 4-2=2.

Wait, but wait: the reaction might also affect the ring. If the ring's double bond is opened, the ring would become a chain, which would reduce the DoU for the ring. Alternatively, perhaps the ring remains, but the double bonds are saturated.

Wait, perhaps the reaction converts each double bond into a single bond, regardless of whether it's in the ring or a substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't affect the ring, but only the substituents' double bonds. That might not make sense, though.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could cause complete saturation of all double bonds. So the two double bonds in the molecule become single bonds, each adding two H (from HI), reducing the DoU by two.

So initial DoU =4. After reaction, DoU=2.

But wait, the question is about the product's index of hydrogen deficiency. So if the reaction adds HI to both double bonds, the product would have no double bonds, so DoU would be the ring (1) plus any other rings or double bonds.

Wait, no. The ring itself contributes one DoU (for the ring), and if the double bonds in the ring and substituents are saturated, then the DoU would be 1 (ring) plus any other structures.

Wait, but the ring was originally a cyclohexene (so a ring plus a double bond, giving two DoU). If the ring's double bond is saturated, the ring would still be a ring (1 DoU), but the double bond would be gone (so DoU decreases by 1).

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think of the product structure after reaction.

The starting material has two double bonds: one in the ring (cyclohexene) and one in the vinyl group.

Reaction with HI and red phosphorus: perhaps the reaction adds HI across each double bond, converting each into a single bond. So the ring's double bond becomes a single bond (no longer contributing to DoU), and the vinyl group's double bond becomes a single bond.

So after reaction:

- The ring is now a cyclohexane (still a ring, contributing 1 DoU).

- The vinyl group becomes a CH₂CH₂ group (but attached to the ring, so it's a single bond).

- The formyl group (CHO) remains as is.

The substituents' double bonds are gone, so DoU is 1 (from the ring) plus any other double bonds.

Wait, but the formyl group has a double bond (C=O), so that's another DoU.

So the product's DoU would be:

- Ring: 1 DoU.

- C=O in formyl: 1 DoU.

Total DoU: 2.

Wait, but the reaction doesn't touch the formyl group, because it's a carbonyl, and the reaction is adding HI to double bonds.

So formyl's double bond remains, so that's one DoU, and the ring is a cyclohexane (so one DoU for the ring). The other double bonds (ring and vinyl) are now single bonds.

So initial DoU was 4 (ring (2) + formyl (1) + vinyl (1)), but after reaction, ring's double bond is gone, and vinyl's is gone. So what remains is the ring (1 DoU) and the formyl (1 DoU).

So product's DoU is 2.

Wait, but the options don't have 2. The options are A) 1, B)3, C)5, D)0.

Hmm, that's a problem. So perhaps my initial analysis is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't just add HI to the double bonds but does something else. Let me think again. Red phosphorus with HI is used for the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation? No, that's with ketones and peracids. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution across the double bonds, adding HI in a way that breaks the double bonds.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should think about the product structure. The starting material has a formyl group, a vinyl group, and a cyclohexene ring. Reacting with excess HI and red phosphorus could lead to the opening of the ring and the addition of HI to all double bonds.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is a complete saturation of all double bonds and any rings are opened. So the ring would become a chain, and all double bonds would be gone. But how?

Wait, when cyclohexene reacts with excess HI, what happens? I think that cyclohexene would add HI across the double bond, making cyclohexyl iodide with two substituents. But in the presence of red phosphorus, perhaps the reaction is more about the addition of HI to all double bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but that's more about elimination.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a hydrohalogenation, adding HI to each double bond. So the product would have all double bonds saturated.

So in the product, the cyclohexene ring would become cyclohexane, the vinyl group would become a single bond (CH₂CH₂), and the formyl group remains as is.

So the product's structure would have:

- A cyclohexane ring (1 DoU).

- A formyl group (CHO, which is a double bond, so 1 DoU).

So total DoU is 2.

But the options don't include 2, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, let me recount the initial DoU of the starting material.

The starting material: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

Breaking it down:

- Cyclohexene ring: 1 ring (1 DoU) + 1 double bond (1 DoU) = 2 DoU.

- Formyl group (CHO): 1 DoU (C=O).

- Vinyl group (CH₂=CH-): 1 DoU (the double bond).

So total DoU is 2 (ring) + 1 (CHO) + 1 (vinyl) =4.

After reaction, the ring's double bond is gone (so 1 DoU for the ring), the vinyl's double bond is gone (so 0 DoU from there), but formyl remains (1 DoU). So total DoU is 2.

But the options don't have 2. So perhaps I've made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is adding HI to all double bonds, which would include the formyl group's carbonyl. But that's unlikely, as the carbonyl is less reactive than alkenes. In the presence of excess HI, perhaps the reaction adds HI to the formyl group as well, leading to a CH₂I group or something.

Wait, but I'm not sure if HI would add to a carbonyl group. Carbonyl groups are usually attacked by nucleophiles like H- (in NaBH4 or similar), but HI is a strong acid and a good nucleophile.

Alternatively, perhaps the formyl group is converted into a diol or something else.

Wait, perhaps under these conditions, the formyl group (CHO) is converted into a CH₂OH group or something else. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't affect the formyl group, only the alkenes.

If that's the case, then the product would have DoU of 2 (ring + formyl), but this isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the DoU of the product. Let me try to calculate it again.

Product structure after reaction:

- The cyclohexene ring has been saturated to cyclohexane, so one DoU (the ring).

- The vinyl group has been saturated to a single bond, so no DoU from there.

- The formyl group's carbonyl remains, so one DoU.

So total DoU = 2.

But the options don't have 2. So perhaps I'm missing something in the reaction.

Wait, maybe the product isn't just the addition of HI but something else. For example, if the reaction is a dihydroxylation, adding two OH groups across each double bond. But that would lead to more oxygen in the molecule.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a complete addition of HI to all double bonds, including the ring's.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the cyclohexene ring opens up when HI is added, converting the ring into a straight chain. But that would require breaking the ring, which would change the DoU.

Wait, if the ring opens, the ring's DoU is lost, and a chain is formed. So the ring's DoU (1) is gone, and the double bonds are gone. But then, the product would have a chain with a carboxylic acid group, a formyl group, and a former vinyl group (now single bond).

In that case, the product's DoU would be:

- No ring (so 0).

- Any double bonds: only the formyl's C=O, which is 1 DoU.

So DoU is 1.

Ah, wait, that would make the answer 1, which is option A.

But how does the ring open? For that to happen, the reaction would have to break the ring. Maybe the addition of HI across the ring's double bond causes the ring to open.

Wait, cyclohexene has a double bond. Adding HI across it would form a di-substituted cyclohexane, but that doesn't break the ring. Unless the addition leads to a ring-opening reaction, which I'm not sure about.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more about the substituents. Let me think: the formyl group is at position 2, the vinyl at position 5, and the ring has a double bond at 3 and 4.

If the reaction adds HI across the ring's double bond, converting it into a single bond and breaking the ring, that would change the structure. But I'm not sure if that's feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a complete hydrogenation, but that's more with H2 and a catalyst. Red phosphorus and HI are different.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but that would require existing halogens, which I don't think are present.

Wait, another angle: the reaction of formyl groups with HI. Maybe the formyl group (CHO) reacts with HI to form CH₂OH. But I'm not sure about the exact reaction conditions.

Alternatively, the formyl group could be reduced to CH₂OH, but that would require a reducing agent like H2 and a catalyst, which isn't present here.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something in the reaction conditions. Red phosphorus and excess HI could be used in the hydrolysis of nitriles, but this molecule doesn't have a nitrile. Alternatively, in the presence of red phosphorus and HI, maybe it's a reaction for the addition of H to each double bond.

So, assuming each double bond (ring and vinyl) is saturated, the product would have:

- Ring: cyclohexane (1 DoU).

- Vinyl: CH₂CH₂ (no DoU).

- Formyl: CHO (1 DoU).

So DoU is 2.

But since that's not an option, perhaps the reaction also affects the formyl group, making it CH₂OH. Then, the formyl's DoU would be gone (no longer a double bond), and the product would have:

- Ring: 1 DoU.

- No other double bonds.

So DoU is 1, which is option A.

But how does the formyl group react? Adding HI to a carbonyl group isn't common, but perhaps under these conditions, it does.

Alternatively, perhaps the formyl group is not affected, and the product's DoU remains at 2, but the options don't include that. So perhaps I made a mistake in counting the initial DoU.

Wait, let me re-calculate the initial DoU.

Molecular formula approach:

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

Assuming the formula is C9 H10 O3 (I'm not sure, but let's proceed).

DoU = [2C +2 - H - X + N]/2.

Assuming no X or N, it's [2*9 +2 -10 +0]/2 = (20-10)/2=5.

So DoU is 5.

Wait, that's a problem because earlier I thought it was 4. So perhaps I miscalculated earlier.

Wait, if the formula is C9 H10 O3, then:

DoU = (2*9 +2 -10)/2 = (20-10)/2=5.

So initial DoU is 5.

Then, after reaction with HI and red phosphorus, what changes?

If all double bonds are saturated, including the formyl group, then the DoU would decrease by each double bond converted.

Wait, but the formyl group is a carbonyl, which is a double bond (DoU 1). The ring has a double bond (DoU 1), and the vinyl group has a double bond (DoU 1). So initial DoU is 3 (ring + formyl + vinyl) plus the ring's ring (1), totaling 4? Or wait, the ring contributes two DoU (1 for the ring, 1 for the double bond). So initial DoU is 4.

Wait, no. The formula-based DoU is 5, which suggests more than that. So perhaps the starting material has 5 degrees of unsaturation.

So how does that happen?

Let me recount:

Formula of starting material: C9 H10 O3.

DoU = [2*9 +2 -10]/2 = (20-10)/2=5.

So DoU is 5.

What contributes to these 5 DoU?

- One ring (1 DoU).

- One double bond in the ring (1 DoU).

- One double bond in the vinyl group (1 DoU).

- One double bond in the formyl group (1 DoU).

- One more DoU from somewhere else. Hmm, where?

Ah, perhaps the substituents are more complex. Wait, the cyclohexene ring has 6 C, and the substituents are at positions 1 (COOH), 2 (CHO), and 5 (vinyl).

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the ring has a bridge or another double bond. No, the name is cyclohex-3-ene, so only one double bond in the ring.

So, considering the formula-based DoU of 5, perhaps I'm missing another double bond or ring.

Wait, maybe the substituents add another DoU. For example, the vinyl group has a double bond (1 DoU), the formyl has a double bond (1 DoU), the ring has two DoU (ring and double bond), and perhaps the COOH group contributes another, but no, COOH is a single bond with a double bond in the carbonyl. So that's already counted.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe the starting material also has another double bond I'm not considering.

Alternatively, perhaps the carboxylic acid is part of a conjugated system. But I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents add additional rings or double bonds. But according to the name, the substituents are formyl and vinyl, which I've accounted for.

So the formula-based DoU is 5, which is higher than what I previously thought. So perhaps I should proceed with that.

Now, the reaction: adding HI and red phosphorus.

If this reaction saturates all double bonds, then each DoU is reduced by one per double bond.

Assuming all double bonds are saturated:

- Ring's double bond: 1 DoU lost.

- Vinyl group's double bond: 1 DoU lost.

- Formyl group's double bond: 1 DoU lost.

So initial DoU 5 → 5-3=2.

But that's not an option. So perhaps the reaction doesn't affect the formyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the formyl group's double bond remains, and only the ring and vinyl are saturated.

So initial DoU 5.

After reaction: ring and vinyl's DoU are gone. So DoU is 5-2=3.

But that's option B.

Wait, but the product would then have DoU 3. So that's an option.

But let me think again. If the reaction adds HI to the ring's double bond and the vinyl's double bond, but not the formyl's, then the DoU would be reduced by two.

So from 5 → 3.

That would correspond to option B.

But wait, what about the ring? The ring is still present, contributing one DoU.

So if the ring is saturated (double bond gone), then the ring's DoU is 1 (only the ring remains), and the formyl's DoU is 1, making a total of two DoU. But according to formula, initial DoU is 5.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't affect the formyl group. So the product would have:

- Ring: single bond (so only the ring's DoU remains: 1).

- Vinyl group: single bond (no DoU).

- Formyl group: double bond (1 DoU).

So total DoU: 2.

But according to the formula-based approach, initial DoU is 5, so after reaction, if two DoU are lost, it would be 3.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between the structure and the formula. Let me proceed with the formula-based approach.

The product's formula after reaction:

Each double bond adding two H from HI. So for each double bond, the product gains two H.

Starting formula: C9 H10 O3.

If all three double bonds are saturated (ring, vinyl, formyl), how does the formula change?

Each double bond saturation adds two H.

So for three double bonds, adds 6 H.

So the product's formula would be C9 H16 O3.

But wait, the formyl group has a double bond, so if it's saturated, it becomes CH2O.

Wait, perhaps the formyl group (CHO) is converted into CH2OH.

So, the product would have a structure with:

- Cyclohexane (no double bond in ring).

- The formyl group becomes CH2OH (single bond).

- The vinyl group becomes CH2CH2 (single bond).

So the product's formula would have more H.

But I'm getting too stuck. Let's approach this differently.

The product's index of hydrogen deficiency is the DoU. The options are A)1, B)3, C)5, D)0.

If the reaction adds HI to all double bonds, including the formyl group, the product would have no double bonds, so DoU is 0. But that's only if all double bonds are saturated. But formyl groups are generally resistant to such additions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't affect the formyl group, so the product has DoU 1 (from the formyl group) plus any other DoU.

Wait, maybe the reaction doesn't add HI to the formyl group. So after reaction, the product's DoU would be:

- Ring's DoU: 1 (if the ring remains as a ring, but the double bond is gone).

- Formyl group's DoU: 1.

- Vinyl group's DoU: 0.

So total DoU is 2.

But again, this isn't an option. So perhaps I'm missing a key point.

Wait, another thought: the reaction is a complete addition of HI to all double bonds, including the ring. So the ring is opened, converting into a chain. So the ring's DoU is gone, and the double bonds are gone.

So the product would have:

- A chain structure (no ring, so 0 DoU from ring).

- The formyl group's double bond (1 DoU).

- The vinyl group's double bond is gone (saturated).

So total DoU is 1.

Which is option A.

But how does the ring open? Maybe the addition of HI across the ring's double bond breaks the ring, converting it into a chain. That would make the ring's DoU zero and the double bond gone. So the product's DoU would be 1 (from formyl group).

So the answer would be A) 1.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the index of hydrogen deficiency (DoU), also known as the degree of unsaturation, of the product formed when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI. The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Structure of the Starting Material**:  
   The starting material, 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, consists of:
   - A cyclohexene ring (6 carbons) with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4.
   - A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at position 1.
   - A formyl group (-CHO) at position 2.
   - A vinyl group (-CH=CH-) at position 5.

   This structure contributes the following degrees of unsaturation:
   - The cyclohexene ring contributes 2 DoU (1 for the ring and 1 for the double bond).
   - The formyl group contributes 1 DoU (C=O).
   - The vinyl group contributes 1 DoU (C=C).
   - Total initial DoU = 2 (ring) + 1 (formyl) + 1 (vinyl) = **4 DoU**.

2. **Reaction with Red Phosphorus and Excess HI**:  
   Red phosphorus and HI are known to add across double bonds, converting them into single bonds. In this reaction:
   - The double bond in the cyclohexene ring is saturated, reducing the DoU by 1.
   - The double bond in the vinyl group is saturated, reducing the DoU by 1.
   - The formyl group's carbonyl double bond (C=O) is not affected under these conditions, so it remains intact.

   After the reaction:
   - The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring (still contributing 1 DoU for the ring).
   - The vinyl group becomes a single bond (no longer contributing to DoU).
   - The formyl group retains its carbonyl double bond (contributing 1 DoU).

3. **Final Degree of Unsaturation**:  
   After the reaction, the product has:
   - 1 DoU from the cyclohexane ring.
   - 1 DoU from the formyl group's carbonyl bond.
   - Total DoU = 1 (ring) + 1 (formyl) = **2 DoU**.

4. **Revisiting the Options**:  
   The calculated DoU of 2 does not match any of the provided options. However, if the reaction conditions are interpreted to fully saturate all double bonds (including the formyl group), the product would have no double bonds remaining, resulting in a DoU of **1**. This aligns with option A.

Given the reaction conditions and the possible interpretation of the product's structure, the most reasonable answer is:

**Answer: A**
