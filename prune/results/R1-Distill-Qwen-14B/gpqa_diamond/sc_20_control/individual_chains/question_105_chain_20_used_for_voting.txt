Okay, I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. Let me read it again and think through it step by step.

So, the problem is about a star similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere is covered with dark spots that have a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K. When only one hemisphere has spots, the photometric observations (brightness over time) will show periodic variations because the star is rotating. The question is, if this situation is making the brightness variations look similar to those caused by an exoplanet transiting the star, what would be the radius of the exoplanet relative to the star's radius to produce the same amplitude in the light curve?

Hmm, I remember that when a planet transits a star, the dip in brightness is proportional to the square of the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius. The formula is (R_planet / R_star)^2. But this case is a bit different because it's not a planet causing the dip but spots on the star.

Wait, so the star has spots. When the spots are facing us, the star's brightness decreases because the spots are cooler and emit less light. The same effect would happen as the star rotates, making the brightness dip periodically. But if the star didn't have spots, an exoplanet would cause a similar dip when it transits.

The problem says the situation can closely resemble an exoplanet. So we need to find what planet radius would produce the same brightness variation as the spots do.

Let me think about how the brightness variation works in both cases.

In the case of the star with spots: The brightness variation comes from the spots rotating into and out of view. The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. Since the star is a sphere, each hemisphere is half of the star's surface. Wait, no, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere that's covered. So one hemisphere is 50% of the star's surface area, and 20% of that is covered in spots.

So the total area of the spots is 0.2 * (π R_star^2 / 2) )? Because a hemisphere's area is (4π/2) = 2π R², but wait, no: Area of a sphere is 4π R², so a hemisphere is 2π R². So the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

But wait, the filling factor is 20% for each spot. Oh wait, no, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered. So if the whole hemisphere is 2π R², the spots cover 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

But how does this affect the star's brightness? The brightness depends on the temperature of the emitting regions. The star's normal brightness is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ Teff^4.

But when the spots are on the surface, each spot emits less. Each spot has T_spot = Teff - 1000 K = 5000 K.

So the total emitted flux when spots are visible would be the sum of the normal areas and the cooler spots.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to calculate the fractional change in brightness. So when the spots are on the visible hemisphere, the brightness is lower. The fractional change in brightness (ΔF) is the difference between the normal flux and the flux when spots are present.

The star's total flux without spots is F_total = 4π R² σ (6000)^4. But when spots are on the hemisphere, the flux from the spotted area is less.

Wait, more precisely: the star's surface (without spots) emits uniformly. When there are spots, the emitting area is a mix of normal and cooler regions.

Let me consider the star's total brightness when the spots are visible. The fraction of the area covered by spots is 0.2 in the hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (area of hemisphere) = 0.2 * (2π R²) = 0.4 π R².

The flux from the spots is F_spots = (area of spots) * σ (T_spot)^4.

The flux from the non-spots in the hemisphere is F_non_spots = (hemisphere area - spot area) * σ (Teff)^4.

Wait, but the hemisphere is only the part we're considering. But the other hemisphere is not spotty. Wait, no: the question says one hemisphere is covered in spots, so when the spots are facing us, the brightness is lower, and when the star rotates so the other hemisphere (without spots) is facing us, brightness returns to normal.

Wait, no. Actually, the star's rotation would cause the spots to come in and out of view. So when the star is viewed from Earth, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the observed flux is lower. When the other hemisphere (without spots) is facing us, the flux is normal.

But I think I need to calculate the difference in brightness when the spots are facing us versus when they're not. The variation in brightness (ΔF) is the difference between the normal flux and the flux with spots.

So let's compute the flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible and compare it to when the unspotted hemisphere is visible.

When the spotted hemisphere is facing us:

The flux from the spotted hemisphere is (area of hemisphere) * σ T_spot^4.

Wait, no. Because the hemisphere is 2π R², and the spots cover 20% of that. So the flux from the spotted hemisphere is:

F_spotted_hemisphere = (0.2 * 2π R²) * σ (5000)^4 + (0.8 * 2π R²) * σ (6000)^4.

The unspotted hemisphere (the other one) is not visible when the spotted one is, so the total flux when the spotted hemisphere is viewed is F_spotted_hemisphere.

Wait, no, because when the star is viewed from Earth, we see one hemisphere at a time. So if the star is rotating, the spotted hemisphere will be visible for half the rotation period, and the other (unspotted) hemisphere for the other half.

Wait, no, wait: If the star has only one hemisphere with spots, which is always the same side, like the Sun's visible hemisphere has spots and the far side doesn't. So when the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes into view, and then the unspotted comes into view.

Wait, but for a star, the total flux would depend on which hemisphere is visible. So when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_spotted_hemisphere.

Wait, no, the star's total flux when the spotted hemisphere is facing us is the flux from the spotted hemisphere. And when the other hemisphere is facing us, it's the flux from that hemisphere (which has no spots, so the same as the whole star's flux without any spots).

Wait, but let's think about it: the star's total flux without any spots is F_total = 4π R² σ (6000)^4.

But when one hemisphere is spotted, when that hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_spotted = (2π R²) * (0.2 σ (5000)^4 + 0.8 σ (6000)^4).

Wait, no. Let me compute the flux from the spotted hemisphere when it's the one facing us.

The spotted hemisphere has 20% of its area covered with spots. Each spot is cooler (5000 K) than the rest (6000 K).

So the flux from the spotted hemisphere is:

F_spotted_hemisphere = (0.2 * 2π R²) * σ (5000)^4 + (0.8 * 2π R²) * σ (6000)^4.

Similarly, the flux from the unspotted hemisphere (when it's facing us) is:

F_unspotted_hemisphere = (2π R²) * σ (6000)^4.

Because the other hemisphere has no spots, so the entire area is at 6000 K.

So the variation in flux (ΔF) is F_unspotted_hemisphere - F_spotted_hemisphere.

But wait, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the observed flux is F_spotted_hemisphere. When the unspotted is facing us, it's F_unspotted_hemisphere.

So the brightness variation is the difference between these two. The amplitude of the variation is the maximum change in flux, which occurs when the star goes from the unspotted to the spotted state.

So the amplitude ΔF is F_unspotted - F_spotted.

Let me compute this.

Compute each term:

F_unspotted_hemisphere = 2π R² σ (6000)^4.

F_spotted_hemisphere = [0.2 * 2π R² σ (5000)^4] + [0.8 * 2π R² σ (6000)^4].

So,

F_spotted = 2π R² σ [ 0.2*(5000)^4 + 0.8*(6000)^4 ]

So, ΔF = F_unspotted - F_spotted.

Substituting,

ΔF = 2π R² σ (6000)^4 - 2π R² σ [0.2*(5000)^4 + 0.8*(6000)^4 ]

= 2π R² σ [ (6000)^4 - 0.2*(5000)^4 - 0.8*(6000)^4 ]

Factor out (6000)^4:

= 2π R² σ (6000)^4 [1 - 0.8] - 2π R² σ (0.2) (5000)^4.

Wait, let me compute the term inside the brackets:

1 - 0.8 = 0.2, so

= 2π R² σ [ 0.2*(6000)^4 - 0.2*(5000)^4 ]

= 0.2 * 2π R² σ [ (6000^4 - 5000^4) ]

Factor 0.2 out,

= 0.2 * 2π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 )

Now, the fractional change in brightness is ΔF / F_total, where F_total is the total flux without any spots, which is 4π R² σ (6000)^4.

Wait no, when the star is unspotted, it emits F_total, which is 4π R² σ (6000)^4. But when we're looking at a hemisphere, the flux is F_unspotted_hemisphere = 2π R² σ (6000)^4. So yes, the total flux when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us is 2π R² σ (6000)^4, which is half of F_total (since F_total is 4π R² ... ).

Wait, maybe I should normalize the fluxes based on the star's total flux. Let me think about it as a fraction.

The fractional change is (F_spotted_hemisphere - F_unspotted_hemisphere) divided by the average or the baseline?

Wait, actually, the maximum dip in brightness when the spots are visible is [F_unspotted - F_spotted] divided by F_unspotted, perhaps. Because when the unspotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_unspotted, and when the spotted is visible, it's F_spotted. So the dip is (F_unspotted - F_spotted) / F_unspotted.

Wait, no. The dip is (F_unspotted - F_spotted) / F_unspotted, because when the spots are visible, the flux is lower.

Wait, perhaps the amplitude of the variation (the depth) would be (F_unspotted - F_spotted) / F_unspotted.

So the relative brightness change is (F_unspotted - F_spotted) / F_unspotted.

Let me compute this.

Compute the numerator: F_unspotted - F_spotted = 2π R² σ (6000^4) - [0.2*2π R² σ (5000^4) + 0.8 * 2π R² σ (6000^4) ]

Which is 2π R² σ [6000^4 - (0.2*5000^4 + 0.8*6000^4 ) ]

= 2π R² σ [6000^4 - 0.2*5000^4 -0.8 *6000^4 ]

= 2π R² σ [ (1 - 0.8) *6000^4 - 0.2 *5000^4 ]

= 2π R² σ [ 0.2 *6000^4 - 0.2*5000^4 ]

= 0.2 * 2π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 )

So the numerator is 0.2 * 2π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 )

Denominator is F_unspotted = 2π R² σ (6000^4 )

So the relative brightness change (dip) is:

(0.2 * 2π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 )) / (2π R² σ 6000^4 )

Simplify the terms:

= 0.2 * (6000^4 -5000^4 ) / 6000^4

Factor out 5000^4 in numerator:

= 0.2 * [5000^4 ( (6000/5000)^4 - 1 ) ] / (6000^4 )

= 0.2 * [ (6/5)^4 - 1 ] * (5000^4) / (6000^4 )

But 5000/6000=5/6, so 5000^4/6000^4 = (5/6)^4.

So,

= 0.2 * [ ( (6/5)^4 ) - 1 ) ] * (5/6)^4

Compute (6/5)^4:

6/5 is 1.2. 1.2^4 is approximately (1.2^2)^2 = (1.44)^2 ≈ 2.0736.

So,

= 0.2 * (2.0736 - 1) * (5/6)^4.

Compute 2.0736 -1 =1.0736.

Then, multiply by 0.2: 0.2 *1.0736=0.21472.

Multiply by (5/6)^4. Compute (5/6)^4.

5/6 ≈0.833333.

(5/6)^2 =25/36≈0.6944.

(5/6)^4 = (25/36)^2 ≈ 625/1296 ≈0.482253.

So,

0.21472 *0.482253 ≈ approximately 0.1035.

So the relative brightness dip is about 0.1035, which is 10.35%.

Wait, but wait. Let me recheck the calculations because it's a bit involved.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute each term numerically.

Compute (6000^4 - 5000^4)/6000^4 = [ (6^4 -5^4) * 10^4 ] / (6^4 *10^4 ) = (6^4 -5^4)/6^4.

Compute 6^4 = 1296, 5^4=625. So 1296 -625=671.

So 671/1296 ≈ 0.51759.

So, 0.2 * 0.51759 ≈ 0.1035.

Which is approximately 10.35% dip.

So the relative change is about 10.35% dip in brightness when the spotted hemisphere is facing us.

But wait, another approach: the total flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible is F_spotted = 0.2 * (5000^4) + 0.8 * (6000^4 ), multiplied by 2π R²σ.

So the relative flux is F_spotted / F_unspotted.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the fractional change as [ (F_unspotted - F_spotted) / F_unspotted ].

Which is [1 - (F_spotted / F_unspotted)].

Compute F_spotted / F_unspotted:

F_spotted = [0.2 *5000^4 +0.8*6000^4 ] *2π R²σ.

F_unspotted = 6000^4 *2π R²σ.

So,

F_spotted / F_unspotted = [0.2*(5000/6000)^4 + 0.8 ]

Compute 5000/6000 =5/6≈0.833333.

(5/6)^4 ≈0.482253.

So,

0.2 *0.482253 +0.8 =0.09645 + 0.8= 0.89645.

So,

1 - 0.89645 =0.10355 → about 10.355% dip.

So the dip is about ~10.35% when the spots are visible.

Now, if the same amplitude is caused by a planet transiting, what would be the planet's radius?

For a transit, the fractional dip in brightness is (R_planet / R_star)^2.

So, (R_planet / R_star )^2 = 0.10355.

Take the square root:

R_planet / R_star = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ sqrt(0.1) ≈0.316, but let's compute more accurately.

0.10355 → sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218.

So approximately 0.32 R_star.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32.

Wait, but wait. The problem says: "only one hemisphere is spotty, photometric time-series observations will reveal periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation."

Wait, but when a planet transits, the dip is a one-time dip (assuming the planet's orbital period is much longer than the observation time, but here the brightness variation is due to rotation, which is a much shorter period.

But the question states that the situation (spots) can "closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet." So in terms of the amplitude, it's the same as a planet with R_planet/R_star such that (R_planet/R_star)^2 = fractional dip.

So the dip is ~10.35%, so (R_planet/R_star)^2=0.1035, so R_planet/R_star ≈ sqrt(0.1035)≈0.3218, which is approximately 0.32. So the answer should be option D) ~0.32.

Wait, but wait. Another point: the star has spots on only one hemisphere. So when it's rotating, the spots come into view and then go out of view, leading to a periodic dip in brightness.

But in the case of a planet, the dip is a sharp decrease as the planet blocks the starlight, and then a quick recovery. But for spots, the dip would be a more gradual change because the spots cover a significant portion of the hemisphere, leading to a smoother change in brightness as the spots rotate in and out of view.

But the question is about the amplitude of the brightness variation, not the shape. So regardless of the shape, the amplitude is the same as that of a planet causing a dip of ~10% of the star's brightness.

Wait, but the planet's transit causes a dip of (R_planet / R_star )². So the dip is (Rp/R*)^2.

Wait, but in this problem, the dip is about 10%, so (Rp/R*)²=0.1035 → Rp/R*≈0.32.

So the correct option is D) ~0.32.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 0.32. So the answer must be D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve as the observed brightness variation caused by the star's spots, we analyze the situation as follows:

1. **Star Properties and Spots**:  
   - The star has a radius equal to the Sun's radius, \( R_{\text{star}} \).  
   - One hemisphere is covered with dark spots, with a filling factor of 20%.  
   - The star's effective temperature is \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \), and the spots are cooler, with \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).  

2. **Brightness Variation Due to Spots**:  
   - When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the observed flux decreases due to the cooler spots.  
   - The flux from the spotted hemisphere is calculated as:  
     \[
     F_{\text{spotted}} = 0.2 \cdot 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma \cdot (5000)^4 + 0.8 \cdot 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma \cdot (6000)^4
     \]
   - The flux from the unspotted hemisphere is:  
     \[
     F_{\text{unspotted}} = 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma \cdot (6000)^4
     \]
   - The brightness variation amplitude is the fractional change in flux when transitioning between the unspotted and spotted hemispheres:  
     \[
     \Delta F = \frac{F_{\text{unspotted}} - F_{\text{spotted}}}{F_{\text{unspotted}}}
     \]

3. **Calculating the Fractional Brightness Dip**:  
   - Substituting the flux expressions, the fractional brightness dip is:  
     \[
     \Delta F = 1 - \left( \frac{0.2 \cdot (5000)^4 + 0.8 \cdot (6000)^4}{(6000)^4} \right)
     \]
   - Simplifying further:  
     \[
     \Delta F = 1 - \left( 0.2 \cdot \left(\frac{5000}{6000}\right)^4 + 0.8 \right)
     \]
   - Using \( \left(\frac{5000}{6000}\right)^4 \approx 0.482 \):  
     \[
     \Delta F = 1 - \left( 0.2 \cdot 0.482 + 0.8 \right) = 1 - 0.896 = 0.104 \, \text{(or ~10.4%)}.
     \]

4. **Relating to Exoplanet Transit**:  
   - The fractional brightness dip caused by a transiting exoplanet is given by:  
     \[
     \left(\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2 = \Delta F
     \]
   - Substituting \( \Delta F = 0.104 \):  
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.104} \approx 0.32
     \]

5. **Conclusion**:  
   - The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet, relative to the host star, is approximately \( 0.32 \).  

**Answer: D**
