Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out what the compound is based on the spectral data. Let me see what I can do. Okay, let's break down the information given.

First, the molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 with 100% intensity. There's another peak at m/z 158 with 32% intensity. Hmm, I remember that molecular ion peaks can sometimes indicate the molecular formula, especially if there's a pattern. The mass spec peaks can suggest possible adducts or isotopic peaks. The 158 is 2 units higher than 156. Wait, chlorine has an atomic mass around 35, but if the molecule has a Cl, the molecular ion would be higher. Wait, wait—actually, chlorine's molecular weight is about 35.45, but considering isotopes, maybe the molecular ion at 156 includes a Cl. Or perhaps the 158 is a chlorine isotope? Wait, chlorine has two main isotopes: about 75% 35Cl (mass 35) and 25% 37Cl (mass 37). So, if the molecular ion is at 156, and another peak is at 158, that might be the 37Cl isotope. So the molecular weight would be 156, which is likely the M+ peak. So the molecular formula must be something that weighs around 156.

Next, looking at the IR data. There's a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1, which usually suggests either an -OH group (like in an alcohol or carboxylic acid) or maybe an amine. But wait, if it's a broad peak, and looking at the options, let's see. The strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 is important. That's a region where carbonyl groups (C=O) appear. So maybe it's a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or acid. For acids, the carbonyl is about 1700 cm^-1, but sometimes a bit higher. Aldehydes have higher wavenumbers, around 2800 for the aldehyde C-H stretch, but their carbonyl is around 1720. Benzoic acid’s carbonyl is around 1700, but maybe a bit higher.

Looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm. That's a high chemical shift, likely an aldehyde proton or a carboxylic acid's -OH. Wait, but carboxylic acids usually have broad peaks around 10-12 ppm, but they can appear as singlets because of the exchange with water. But wait, in the IR, there's a broad peak, which could be the -OH of a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, the aldehyde proton would be a singlet, but it's usually around 9-10 ppm. Hmm, wait, in the NMR, it's 11.0 ppm, which is a bit higher for an aldehyde. Alternatively, maybe it's an -OH group. But wait, the other option is that it's an acidic proton like from a phenol or a carboxylic acid.

Looking at the other NMR signals: 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm, both doublets, each integrating to 2H. So probably two sets of aromatic protons. If it's a benzene ring with substituents, maybe para-substituted. For example, in a para-substituted benzaldehyde, the protons next to the substituent would be as doublets. Alternatively, if it's a benzoic acid, the substituents would be in the para positions.

Now, let's look at the options.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure would be Cl at position 3, OH at 2, and aldehyde at position 1. Wait, no, maybe numbering is different. Alternatively, let's draw it. Benzaldehyde has the aldehyde group on the ring. If it's 3-chloro-2-hydroxy, then the ring would have the aldehyde at position 1, Cl at position 3, and OH at position 2. The aromatic protons would be in a certain pattern. The aldehyde proton would be around 9-10 ppm, but the NMR shows 11.0, so maybe it's the OH of the carboxylic acid, not the aldehyde. Hmm, but in this case, it's an aldehyde, but the NMR is at 11, which is higher than usual. Maybe it's an acidic proton, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a different structure.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is a benzene ring with Cl at the para position and a COOH group attached. So the COOH would have a broad peak in the IR (which we have) and a proton in the NMR. The NMR of benzoic acid would have the COOH proton as a broad peak around 12 ppm, but in our case, it's a singlet at 11.0. The aromatic protons would be in certain positions. For 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the ring substituents are at 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). So the aromatic protons would typically be as a doublet of doublets or maybe two doublets. Let me think: the ring would have two sets of protons, each as doublets. The H's ortho to COOH would be deshielded, perhaps appearing as a doublet, and the H's meta to Cl would be another doublet.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Structure is OClC-O-Ph. Wait, no, chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-. So the structure would be Cl-CO-O-Ph. So the functional groups would be the ester (CO-O-) and the Cl. The IR would show a strong carbonyl (ester), which is around 1720 cm^-1, matching. The NMR: the ester OCH would have... wait, no, the chloroformate would have Cl attached to the carbonyl. So the structure is Cl-CO-O-Ph. The aromatic protons would be in a pattern. For phenyl chloroformate, the aromatic protons would be para to the ester group. The NMR would show two doublets as well, each integrating to 2H, similar to the data. The carbonyl would be present. But what about the singlet at 11.0? Wait, phenyl chloroformate doesn't have an -OH or an aldehyde group. So where would the 11.0 ppm proton come from? Maybe it's an exchange peak or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's an impurity, but in the options, this might not fit.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is benzene ring with Cl at position 2 and COOH at position 1. So the substituents are adjacent. The NMR would have aromatic protons as two doublets. The COOH proton would be around 12 ppm, perhaps as a broad singlet. But the NMR shows 11.0 as a singlet, which is close. The IR would have the broad peak for the COOH -OH stretching. The molecular weight: benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Adding Cl, which is about 35.45. So molecular weight would be (C7: 7*12=84) + (H6:6) + (O2:32) + Cl (35.45) = 84+6=90; 90+32=122; 122+35.45=157.45. So the molecular ion should be around 157. But the given molecular ion is at 156. Hmm, that's a problem. Unless I'm miscalculating.

Wait, let me compute molecular weights of the options.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Molecular formula is C7H5ClO2. So:

C:7*12=84
H:5*1=5
Cl:35.45
O:2*16=32
Total: 84 +5=89 +35.45=124.45 +32=156.45. So molecular weight is about 156.45. So the molecular ion at m/z 156 makes sense. The peak at 158 would be the M+2 isotope, which for Cl is about 37. So M is 156, M+2 is 158. So that's matching.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Same formula, so same molecular weight. Oh wait, same formula as option B. So both B and D would have the same molecular weight? Because they both are benzoic acid with Cl substitution, but in different positions. So their molecular weights would be the same.

But looking at the NMR data, let's think.

In option B, 4-chlorobenzoic acid: the ring is substituted at 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). So the aromatic protons are in positions 2,3,5,6. Wait, no. Let me number the ring. Position 1 is COOH, position 4 is Cl. So the ring would have H in positions 2,3,5,6. So the substitution is para. So the protons in positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and positions 3 and 5 would be equivalent.

In the NMR, the peaks are at 8.02 (d) and 7.72 (d), each 2H. So that suggests two sets of doublets, each integrating to 2H. For 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the H in positions 2 and 6 would be adjacent to the COOH group, and their chemical shift would be downfield. The H in positions 3 and 5 would be meta to Cl and para to COOH. So the coupling would be between adjacent protons. So the H in 2 and 6 would each couple with the H in 3 and 5? Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, the ring is such that the H's ortho to COOH are at higher ppm.

Wait, let me think about the substitution. COOH is at position 1, Cl at position 4. So the protons at 2 and 6 would be ortho to COOH, and meta to Cl. The protons at 3 and 5 would be meta to COOH and ortho to Cl. The ortho protons to COOH (positions 2 and 6) would typically be deshielded, so appear downfield. The meta protons (positions 3 and 5) would be less deshielded.

In the NMR, the two doublets are 8.02 (d) and 7.72 (d). So the higher ppm (8.02) would be the protons ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6), and the lower (7.72) would be the meta protons (3 and 5). Each as doublets because each is adjacent to two equivalent protons. Wait, no, each proton is adjacent to one proton on either side. Wait, in the case of para-substituted benzene, the protons are in a symmetrical arrangement. So the H at 2 and 6 would each be next to H at 3 and 1 (COOH, which is deprotonated, so no H there). Hmm, perhaps the coupling is between H2 and H3.

Alternatively, looking at the substitution: for a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, the aromatic protons can split into two groups. For example, the two H's adjacent to COOH (ortho) would be one set, and the two H's adjacent to Cl (ortho) would be another set. Or maybe it's the other way around. Let me think of the chemical shifts. Ortho to COOH (which is an electron-withdrawing group) would cause the protons to be more deshielded, leading to higher ppm. So in the NMR, the 8.02 ppm would be the H's ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6), and the 7.72 would be the H's ortho to Cl (positions 3 and 5). Wait, but Cl is also electron-withdrawing, so would that affect the chemical shift?

Alternatively, the chemical shifts could be influenced by the substituents. COOH is more de-shielding than Cl. So the H's ortho to COOH would be more downfield. So 8.02 would be H2 and H6, ortho to COOH, and 7.72 would be H3 and H5, which are ortho to Cl. So that fits.

Then, the NMR data includes a singlet at 11.0 ppm, which would be the COOH proton. But wait, in the NMR data, the singlet is at 11.0. In benzoic acid derivatives, the COOH proton is usually a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. But in the NMR, it's a singlet, which might suggest it's an exchange process or perhaps a different environment. Alternatively, perhaps it's not the COOH proton because if the compound is a carboxylic acid, the NMR would show a broad peak, not a singlet. Wait, but the given NMR has a singlet, which suggests no splitting. So maybe it's not a COOH group, but something else. Or perhaps the sample is in D2O, making the -OH exchange and appear as a singlet. Alternatively, maybe it's a different group.

Wait, let's go back to the IR. The IR has a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. That could be an -OH stretch. So if it's a carboxylic acid, that broad peak is from the O-H stretch. The strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 is the carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which fits with a carboxylic acid.

So for option B, 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the IR and NMR would fit except for the singlet at 11.0 ppm. Wait, but in the NMR, the peak at 11.0 is a singlet, integrating for 1H. If it's the COOH proton, it's usually broad. But maybe in the spectrum, it's shown as a singlet due to rapid exchange or maybe it's in a different environment. Alternatively, maybe the peak is an aldehyde proton. But if it's an aldehyde, the IR wouldn't show the broad peak unless there's another -OH group, which I don't see.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Structure is Cl-CO-O-Ph. So the functional groups are an ester (CO-O-) and a Cl. The IR would show the ester C=O at about 1720 cm^-1, which matches. The broad peak in IR might be due to an -OH, but phenyl chloroformate doesn't have an -OH group. Unless there's some other functional group. Alternatively, perhaps the broad peak is from an amide, but that's not the case here. So maybe this option doesn't fit the IR data because there's no -OH group to produce the broad peak. Unless the sample was contaminated with water or something, but I think the options are pure.

So thinking again, option B or D.

Now, looking at the options, B is 4-chlorobenzoic acid, D is 2-chlorobenzoic acid.

In the NMR, for option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents are at positions 1 (COOH) and 2 (Cl). So the aromatic protons would be in positions 3,4,5,6.

The H in position 3 would be adjacent to Cl (position 2) and next to H in position 4. H in position 6 would be adjacent to H in position 5. Wait, perhaps I should draw the structure.

In 2-chlorobenzoic acid, the ring has COOH at position 1 and Cl at position 2. So the ring positions are:

1: COOH
2: Cl
3: H
4: H
5: H
6: H

Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me number it correctly. Benzoic acid has the COOH at position 1. Then, when Cl is at position 2, the ring would look like:

1: COOH
2: Cl
3: H
4: H
5: H
6: H

So the aromatic protons would be at positions 3,4,5,6. But in this arrangement, the Cl is at 2, which is adjacent to COOH. So the ring would have H's at 3,4,5,6. 

The H at position 3 would be ortho to Cl, and meta to COOH. The H at position 6 is para to Cl and meta to COOH? Wait, maybe I'm not getting the substitution right. Alternatively, perhaps the H's near Cl and COOH will have different shifts.

In any case, the substitution pattern would lead to a different splitting in the NMR. For 2-chlorobenzoic acid, the aromatic protons would be split into two sets: those adjacent to Cl (position 3) and those adjacent to COOH (position 6). Or perhaps, the H's in positions 4 and 6 would be a set, and positions 3 and 5 would be another.

Wait, perhaps the coupling is such that each set of protons is a doublet. Let me think about the NMR for 2-chlorobenzoic acid. The H's ortho to COOH (position 2 is Cl, so H at position 3) would be next to Cl. The H's para to COOH would be position 4 and position 6.

Wait, maybe it's better to look up typical NMR shifts for benzoic acid derivatives. For benzoic acid, the ortho protons are typically around 8.1-8.3 ppm, the meta around 7.5-7.8 ppm, and the para around 7.2 ppm. But substitution with electron-withdrawing groups like Cl would deshield the protons further.

In 4-chlorobenzoic acid, since Cl is para to COOH, the protons ortho to COOH (H2 and H6) would be more deshielded and appear upfield. Wait, no, wait: electron-withdrawing groups like Cl would deshield the adjacent protons, making them appear downfield (higher ppm). So in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the H's ortho to COOH (H2 and H6) would be around 8.0-8.2 ppm, and the H's ortho to Cl (H3 and H5) would be around 7.5-7.8 ppm. That matches the NMR data, which has 8.02 ppm (d) and 7.72 ppm (d). Each is a doublet, which makes sense if each H is coupled with one adjacent H. Wait, but in a para-substituted benzene, each H would have two adjacent H's, leading to a doublet of doublets, not a doublet. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the splitting wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the coupling constants are such that the peaks appear as doublets.

Wait, another thought: in para-substituted benzene rings with two substituents, the aromatic protons are often split into two sets of doublets. For example, in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the H's ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6) would couple with H's in adjacent positions (like position 3 and 5 for position 2, and position 5 and 3 for position 6). But due to symmetry, their coupling constants might be the same, leading to each set appearing as a doublet.

Alternatively, perhaps the splitting is more complex, but the NMR shows two doublets, which suggests that each set has one neighboring proton. Maybe in the case of 4-chlorobenzoic acid, each H in the ortho positions (H2 and H6) is only coupled with one H (from position 3 or position 5), hence a doublet. Hmm, not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are such that each H has two equivalent neighbors, leading to a triplet. But the data shows doublets. So maybe I'm not getting the substitution right.

Alternatively, perhaps the H's are part of a meta substitution. Let me think again.

In any case, the main points are the molecular weight, the IR, and the NMR.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Mw ~156.45. The NMR has two doublets in aromatic region, which fits para substitution. The singlet at 11.0 ppm could be the COOH proton, but it's usually a broad peak. Alternatively, maybe it's a different group.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Mw same as B. NMR aromatic protons would have a different pattern because the substituents are adjacent. The singlet at 11.0 would still be the COOH proton.

Wait, another thought: the singlet at 11.0 ppm. If the compound isn't a carboxylic acid but an aldehyde, then the aldehyde proton would be a singlet around 9-10 ppm, but this is 11.0, which is a bit higher. Alternatively, if the compound is a phenol, the -OH would be a broad peak around 5 ppm, but that doesn't fit. So perhaps it's a carboxylic acid, and the singlet is an artifact or due to exchange. Alternatively, maybe the singlet is something else.

Wait, looking back at the options, option A is 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. So structure is Cl at 3, OH at 2, and aldehyde at 1. So the aldehyde proton would be around 9-10 ppm, but the NMR shows 11.0 as a singlet. Maybe it's the -OH proton of the phenol group. But wait, the IR shows a broad peak which could be the -OH of the phenol. So the NMR would show a broad peak for the phenol OH. But the given NMR data shows a singlet at 11.0; maybe that's the aldehyde. Hmm, but 11 seems high for an aldehyde. Alternatively, perhaps it's the OH of the phenol. But then the IR would show a broad peak, which it does. The aldehyde would have a peak around 2800 for the C-H stretch, which the IR data doesn't show. Wait, the IR data shows a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is the aldehyde's C=O. But wait, aldehydes have a strong peak around 2800 cm^-1 for the stretching of the aldehyde C-H (the -CHO group). The IR data doesn't mention any peak around 2800. So maybe it's not an aldehyde.

So Option A would have both an aldehyde and a phenol group. The IR would show peaks for both. The aldehyde's C=O at 1720, which matches. The phenol's O-H would be a broad peak, which the IR data shows. The aldehyde's C-H would be around 2800, but the IR data doesn't mention it. But maybe the IR was only reporting certain peaks. Wait, the IR peaks given are a broad peak from 3500-2700 and a sharp peak at 1720. The 3500-2700 region includes the aldehyde's C-H stretch, which is usually two strong peaks around 2820 and 2720 cm^-1. But maybe the peak is broadened or not clearly observed. Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde's peak is overlapping with another peak.

The NMR of option A would have the aldehyde proton as a singlet around 9-10 ppm, but the data shows 11.0 as a singlet. That's a problem. The phenol's OH would be a broad peak around 5 ppm, but the NMR data shows a singlet at 11.0. So that doesn't fit either.

So perhaps option A isn't correct.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Structure is Cl-CO-O-Ph. The IR would show the ester C=O at 1720 cm^-1, which matches. The peak from 3500-2700 is broad but chloroformate doesn’t have an -OH group. So that's a problem. So the broad peak can't be explained by this structure. Hence, option C is unlikely.

So perhaps the correct answer is option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The molecular weight fits, the IR fits, the NMR aromatic protons fit as two doublets, and the singlet at 11.0 could be the COOH proton, possibly appearing as a singlet due to exchange or sample conditions.

Wait, but why is the COOH proton a singlet and not a broad peak? That’s a point of confusion. Alternatively, perhaps the sample is in D2O, which can cause the -OH to exchange and appear as a singlet. Or maybe it's a deuterated solvent, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a different type of acid, like a sulfonic acid, but that's not an option here.

Looking back at the options, the only two that have a COOH group are B and D. Both have the same molecular weight. So, looking at the NMR, the aromatic protons in 4-chlorobenzoic acid would be two doublets. Let me think about the coupling constants. The H's ortho to COOH would be next to each other, leading to a coupling between H2 and H6, but due to symmetry, they might appear as a doublet. Similarly, the H's adjacent to Cl would couple with each other. So the NMR data fits this scenario.

So, putting it all together, the most likely answer is option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying an unknown compound based on spectral data. Here's the analysis:

### Key Observations:
1. **Mass Spectrometry (MS):**
   - Molecular ion peak at **m/z = 156 (100%)** and a peak at **m/z = 158 (32%)**.
   - The molecular ion at 156 suggests a molecular weight of approximately 156. The peak at 158 corresponds to the **M+2 isotope**, likely due to the presence of chlorine (Cl), which has two isotopes: 35Cl (~75%) and 37Cl (~25%).

2. **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**
   - A **broad peak between 3500-2700 cm⁻¹**, indicative of an -OH group (likely from a carboxylic acid or phenol).
   - A **strong sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹**, characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O), likely from a carboxylic acid or ester.

3. **Proton NMR (1H NMR):**
   - **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A singlet at this chemical shift suggests a highly deshielded proton, likely from a carboxylic acid -OH group.
   - **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets integrating to 2H each, consistent with aromatic protons in a para-substituted benzene ring.

### Analysis of Options:
#### **Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**
- Structure: A benzene ring with an aldehyde group, a hydroxyl group, and a chlorine atom.
- **IR:** The aldehyde C=O would produce a strong peak at ~1720 cm⁻¹, which matches. However, the aldehyde C-H stretch (~2800 cm⁻¹) is not mentioned in the IR data, making this option less likely.
- **NMR:** The aldehyde proton typically appears as a singlet around 9-10 ppm, but the NMR data shows a singlet at **11.0 ppm**, which is too high for an aldehyde. Additionally, the aromatic protons would not produce the observed splitting pattern.  
- **Conclusion:** This option does not fit the data.

#### **Option B: 4-Chlorobenzoic Acid**
- Structure: A benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom in the para position.
- **IR:** The broad peak between 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the carboxylic acid -OH stretch, and the sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ matches the carboxylic acid C=O stretch.
- **NMR:** 
  - The singlet at **11.0 ppm** corresponds to the carboxylic acid -OH proton.
  - The two doublets at **8.02 ppm (d, 2H)** and **7.72 ppm (d, 2H)** match the aromatic protons in a para-substituted benzene ring. The protons ortho to the carboxylic acid (positions 2 and 6) are more deshielded and appear at a higher chemical shift (~8.02 ppm), while the protons meta to the chlorine (positions 3 and 5) appear at a lower chemical shift (~7.72 ppm).
- **Molecular Weight:** The molecular formula is **C₇H₅ClO₂**, with a molecular weight of ~156, matching the molecular ion peak at **m/z = 156**.
- **Conclusion:** This option fits all the data.

#### **Option C: Phenyl Chloroformate**
- Structure: A benzene ring with a chloroformate group (Cl-CO-O-).
- **IR:** The ester C=O stretch at ~1720 cm⁻¹ matches. However, phenyl chloroformate does not have an -OH group, so the broad peak in the IR cannot be explained.
- **NMR:** The aromatic protons would produce a pattern similar to the data, but the absence of an -OH group makes this option inconsistent with the IR data.
- **Conclusion:** This option does not fit the data.

#### **Option D: 2-Chlorobenzoic Acid**
- Structure: A benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom in the ortho position.
- **IR:** The broad peak between 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the carboxylic acid -OH stretch, and the sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ matches the carboxylic acid C=O stretch.
- **NMR:** 
  - The singlet at **11.0 ppm** corresponds to the carboxylic acid -OH proton.
  - The aromatic protons would not produce the observed splitting pattern, as the substituents are ortho to each other, leading to a different coupling pattern.
- **Molecular Weight:** The molecular formula is **C₇H₅ClO₂**, with a molecular weight of ~156, matching the molecular ion peak at **m/z = 156**.
- **Conclusion:** The splitting pattern in the NMR does not match this option, making it less likely than option B.

### Final Answer:
The compound is most consistent with **4-chlorobenzoic acid**. The molecular weight, IR data, and NMR splitting pattern all align with this structure.

**Answer: B**
