Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to unpack it step by step. Okay, the question is about measuring observables P and Q on a quantum system. The state of the system is given, along with the matrices for the operators P and Q. I need to find the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q when measuring them in sequence.

Wait, the order is important here. The problem says someone measures Q just after measuring P. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me read that again. It says if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P. So the sequence is first P, then Q. So first, P is measured, and based on that outcome (which is 0), then Q is measured and we want the outcome to be -1.

Hmm, right. Because in quantum mechanics, measuring one observable affects the state, which then affects the probabilities of the next measurement. So I think I need to find the probability that after measuring P and getting 0, the subsequent measurement of Q gives -1.

But wait, let me remind myself of the process. When you measure an observable, the system collapses into an eigenstate of that observable. So if I measure P and get a value 0, the state immediately becomes the eigenstate corresponding to 0 for P. Then, measuring Q in this new state will give me the probabilities based on that eigenstate. So I need to find the probability of first getting 0 in P, then -1 in Q given that P was 0.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the joint probability of measuring 0 for P and then -1 for Q. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think.

First, let's break down the problem. The initial state is given as a column vector (-1, 2, 1). Wait, that's three components, so it's a 3-dimensional vector. So the system is in a three-level quantum system, right?

The operator P is given by a 3x3 matrix. Let me write that out:

P =
[ [0, 1/√2, 0],
  [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
  [0, 1/√2, 0] ]

Hmm. And the operator Q is another 3x3 matrix:

Q =
[ [1, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, -1] ]

Wait, okay, so Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. So the possible outcomes for measuring Q are 1, 0, and -1.

So, the plan is:

1. Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P, specifically the eigenvector(s) corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Because when we measure P and get 0, the system collapses into that eigenvector.

2. Then, express the initial state in terms of the eigenvectors of P. The probability of getting 0 for P is the square of the amplitude of the component in the 0-eigenstate.

3. Once we have the eigenvector of P corresponding to 0, we can then consider measuring Q on that state. So find the probabilities of getting each eigenvalue of Q in that state.

4. The probability of the combined event (P=0 and then Q=-1) is the product of the probability of getting P=0 and then, given that, the probability of Q=-1.

Wait, but I think that's correct because after measuring P to be 0, the state is projected onto the eigenstate of P corresponding to 0. Then, the measurement of Q is done on this new state.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on whether the eigenvectors of P are orthogonal or not. Let me see. P is a Hermitian matrix because it's an observable, so its eigenvectors are orthogonal. So that should be fine.

So first, find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P. But wait, looking at matrix P, perhaps it's easier to find its eigenvalues.

Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvalues of P are 1, -1, and 0? Let me check. Let me compute the characteristic equation for P.

The characteristic equation is det(P - λ I) = 0.

So the matrix P -λ I is:

[ -λ, 1/√2, 0 ]

[1/√2, -λ, 1/√2 ]

[0, 1/√2, -λ ]

To compute the determinant:

-λ [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2) [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] + 0 [ ... ] 

Wait, perhaps expanding the determinant using the first row.

So,

det = -λ * det [ [ -λ, 1/√2 ], [1/√2, -λ ] ] - (1/√2) * det [ [1/√2, 1/√2 ], [0, -λ ] ] + 0 * something.

Let's compute each minor.

First minor: determinant of the 2x2 matrix when first row is removed and first column is removed.

That's [ -λ   1/√2 ]
      [1/√2 -λ ]

So determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) )= λ² - (1/2).

Second term: the minor for the second element. The element is (1/√2), and the minor is the determinant of the submatrix when first row and second column are removed. So the submatrix is:

[1/√2, 1/√2 ]

[0, -λ ]

Determinant is (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) )= (-λ/√2).

Putting it all together:

det = (-λ) * (λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2) * (-λ/√2) + 0.

Simplifying:

= -λ (λ² - 1/2) + (1/√2)(λ/√2 )

= -λ³ + (λ/2) + (λ/2 )

= -λ³ + λ.

So the characteristic equation is -λ³ + λ = 0 → λ( -λ² + 1 ) =0 → λ=0 or λ²=1 → λ=1, -1.

So the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1.

So the eigenvalue 0 is present, which is what we're interested in for the first measurement.

Now, we need to find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue, but especially for λ=0.

So solving (P - 0 I) v = 0 → P v = 0.

So, the matrix P:

Row 1: 0, 1/√2, 0

Row 2: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2

Row 3: 0, 1/√2, 0

So the system of equations is:

0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0 v3 = 0 → (1/√2) v2 = 0 → v2=0.

Second equation: (1/√2) v1 + 0 v2 + (1/√2) v3 =0 → (1/√2)(v1 + v3) )=0 → v1 + v3 =0 → v3 = -v1.

Third equation: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 =0 → same as first equation, so v2=0.

So the eigenvector for λ=0 is any vector with v2=0 and v3= -v1.

So it's of the form (v1, 0, -v1).

We can choose v1 =1, so the eigenvector is (1, 0, -1). But wait, we need to normalize it.

The length squared is 1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2 = 2. So normalized eigenvector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2).

Wait, let me confirm. So the eigenvector is (1,0,-1), and its norm is sqrt(1 +0 +1) = sqrt(2), so the normalized vector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2).

So the eigenstate for P=0 is |ψ0> = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]^T.

Now, the initial state is given as (-1, 2, 1). Let's call this vector |ψ>.

We can calculate the inner product of |ψ> with |ψ0> to find the amplitude, and then the probability is the square of the absolute value.

So the inner product is (-1)(1/√2) + 2*0 + 1*(-1/√2) )= (-1/√2) - (1/√2) )= (-2)/√2 = -√2.

Wait, because 2/√2 is √2, but here it's -2/√2 which is -√2.

The probability is |amplitude|^2, which is ( (-√2) )^2 = 2.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right. Because probabilities can't exceed 1. So something is wrong here. Oh wait, no. Because the state |ψ0> is normalized, and |ψ> might not be normalized.

Wait, what's the normalization of |ψ>? Let's compute the norm of |ψ>: sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 )= sqrt(1+4+1)= sqrt(6). So |ψ> is not normalized; its norm is sqrt(6).

So the inner product is (-1)(1/√2) + 0 + (1)(-1/√2) = [ (-1) -1 ] /√2 = (-2)/√2 = -√2.

So the amplitude is -√2.

The probability is (amplitude)^2 / (||ψ>||^2) ?

Wait, no. Wait, because when measuring in an eigenstate, the probability is |<ψ0 | ψ>|^2 divided by the norm squared of ψ? Or no, because the state |ψ> is not normalized. Let me think. Let me compute the inner product as <ψ0 | ψ>.

Wait, the probability of getting 0 when measuring P is |<ψ0 | ψ>|^2 divided by the norm of ψ squared? Or is |ψ> assumed to be normalized? Wait, the question says "the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)". It doesn't say it's normalized, so I think we have to normalize it.

So first, let's normalize the initial state |ψ>.

The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1+4+1=6. So the normalized state is (1/√6) * (-1, 2, 1).

So the state vector is |ψ> = [ -1/√6, 2/√6, 1/√6 ]^T.

Now, the inner product with |ψ0> is:

( -1/√6 )(1/√2) + (2/√6)(0) + (1/√6)(-1/√2 )

= [ (-1/√6)(1/√2) ) + ( -1/√6 * 1/√2 ) ]

= [ (-1)/(√6√2) ) - (1)/(√6√2) ) ]

= [ (-2) / (√12) ) ]

Simplify √12 = 2√3 → (-2)/(2√3) )= -1/√3.

So <ψ0 | ψ> is -1/√3.

The probability of measuring 0 for P is |<ψ0 | ψ> |^2 = (1/√3)^2 = 1/3.

So that's the probability of getting P=0.

Now, after measuring P=0, the state collapses to |ψ0>.

Now, we need to measure Q in this state. What are the possible outcomes for Q? As I saw earlier, Q's eigenvalues are 1, 0, and -1.

The eigenstates of Q are the standard basis vectors, since Q is diagonal.

Wait, let me think. Q is a diagonal matrix with elements 1, 0, -1 on the diagonal. So the eigenstates are |e1> = [1,0,0]^T (eigenvalue 1), |e2> = [0,1,0]^T (eigenvalue 0), and |e3> = [0,0,1]^T (eigenvalue -1).

So, given that the state after P=0 is |ψ0> = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]^T, what is the probability of measuring Q=-1?

Because we're looking for Q=-1, the eigenstate is |e3> = [0,0,1]^T.

The amplitude is <e3 | ψ0> = (0)(1/√2) + (0)(0) + (1)(-1/√2) )= -1/√2.

The probability is |amplitude|^2 = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, since |ψ0> is a state, and Q is diagonal, perhaps the probabilities are straightforward.

In |ψ0> = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]^T, the third component is -1/√2, so the probability of Q being -1 is |-1/√2|^2 = 1/2.

So the probability of Q=-1 given that P was 0 is 1/2.

But wait, the question asks for the probability of getting 0 for P and then -1 for Q. So the combined probability is the product of the two probabilities: (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

So the answer would be 1/6, which is option D.

But let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Wait, initial state is |ψ> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T, which I normalized to [ -1/√6, 2/√6, 1/√6 ].

Then, the inner product with |ψ0> is [ (-1/√6)(1/√2) ) + 0 + (1/√6)(-1/√2) ) ].

Which is (-1 -1) / (√6√2) )= (-2)/(√12) = (-2)/(2√3) )= -1/√3.

So the probability is 1/3.

Then, after measurement, the state is |ψ0>, which has components [1/√2, 0, -1/√2].

When measuring Q, the eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. The amplitude for Q=-1 is the third component, which is -1/√2. So the probability is (absolute value squared) 1/2.

So the joint probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

So the correct answer is D) 1/6.

To solve the problem, we analyze the sequence of measurements of observables \( P \) and \( Q \) on a quantum system. The initial state of the system is given as the column vector \((-1, 2, 1)\), which is not normalized. The observable \( P \) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix},
\]

and \( Q \) is represented by:

\[
Q = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of \( P \)
The eigenvalues of \( P \) are determined by solving the characteristic equation \(\det(P - \lambda I) = 0\). This yields eigenvalues \(\lambda = 0, 1, -1\). The eigenvector corresponding to \(\lambda = 0\) is found by solving \((P - 0I)v = 0\). This gives the eigenvector:

\[
| \psi_0 \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Normalizing the Initial State
The initial state \((-1, 2, 1)\) is not normalized. Its norm is:

\[
\| \psi \| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
| \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: Probability of Measuring \( P = 0 \)
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is the square of the absolute value of the inner product of \( | \psi \rangle \) and \( | \psi_0 \rangle \). The inner product is:

\[
\langle \psi_0 | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{-1}{\sqrt{6}} + 0 + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
P(P = 0) = \left| \langle \psi_0 | \psi \rangle \right|^2 = \left( \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Step 4: State After Measuring \( P = 0 \)
If \( P = 0 \) is measured, the system collapses to the eigenstate \( | \psi_0 \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} \).

### Step 5: Probability of Measuring \( Q = -1 \) After \( P = 0 \)
The observable \( Q \) has eigenvalues \( 1, 0, -1 \), with eigenstates \( | e_1 \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \), \( | e_2 \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \), and \( | e_3 \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \), respectively. The probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) is the square of the absolute value of the inner product of \( | \psi_0 \rangle \) and \( | e_3 \rangle \):

\[
\langle e_3 | \psi_0 \rangle = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
P(Q = -1) = \left| \langle e_3 | \psi_0 \rangle \right|^2 = \left( \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 6: Joint Probability
The joint probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and then \( Q = -1 \) is the product of the two probabilities:

\[
P(P = 0, Q = -1) = P(P = 0) \cdot P(Q = -1) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and then \( Q = -1 \) is:
