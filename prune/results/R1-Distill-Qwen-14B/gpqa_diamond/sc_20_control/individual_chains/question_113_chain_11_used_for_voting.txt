Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopic techniques. Let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll think through what each of the given data points means.

The question gives the following information:

1. **FTIR Spectrum**: A very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹, and strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹.
2. **¹H NMR Spectrum**: Shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes.
3. **Mass Spectrometry**: A fragment peak at m/z = 45.
4. The possible formulas are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

I need to figure out which formula fits all these observations.

Starting with the FTIR:

- The broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is probably from O-H stretching, like in an alcohol or carboxylic acid. Wait, but a very broad peak might be more indicative of an alcohol (like -OH) because carboxylic acids tend to have very strong and broad O-H stretches too. Alternatively, it could be from an -NH group, but since the options don't have nitrogen, I'll focus on O-H.

- The peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. 1700 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. But the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak is a bit lower than the typical 1700 for a ketone. Maybe it's an aromatic ring with conjugation, like a carbonyl adjacent to a benzene ring (like an aromatic ester or maybe a conjugated carbonyl group). Alternatively, it could be from a conjugated double bond (like C=C), but the 1650 is more likely a carbonyl with some conjugation or possibly an aromatic ring's C=C stretch.

Wait, another thought: The 1650 might be an aromatic ring's C=C stretch. Wait, but in aromatic compounds like benzene, the C=C stretch is usually around 1450-1600 cm⁻¹. So 1650 is a bit high for that. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like in an ester or a ketone that's conjugated to another group.

But wait, two carbonyl peaks? Or is one of them a different functional group. Let me think: 1700 is a strong peak, probably a carbonyl. 1650 could be an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds, or perhaps an amide, but again, no N in the formula. Wait, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl. For example, in an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound, the carbonyl might be at 1700, and the conjugated double bond (like C=C) would be at around 1650. That makes sense. So maybe the compound has both a carbonyl group and a conjugated double bond.

So the FTIR suggests the presence of a carbonyl group (1700) and perhaps a conjugated double bond (1650). Also, the broad peak at 3000 suggests an -OH group.

Wait, but wait. If the compound has two carbonyl peaks, that might not make sense. Wait, no, 1700 and 1650 could be different things. Maybe the 1700 is a carbonyl, and the 1650 is a C=C in an aromatic ring or another conjugated system. Hmm.

Now looking at the NMR: It shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are on a double bond, so the compound has an alkene group.

So putting that together, the compound has a double bond (from the vinyl H's in NMR) and a carbonyl group (from IR), and possibly an alcohol group (from the broad IR peak).

Now, the mass spec shows a fragment at m/z=45. Let me think about what gives a m/z=45. Common fragments include:

- CH3CO+ (43), but wait, maybe a different fragment. Wait, 45 is 45. 45 could be (CH3)2O+, which is 45 (since (CH3)2O is 45 g/mol). Or maybe a CH2O group? Alternatively, maybe a CH2=CH-O fragment or something. Alternatively, perhaps the loss of water or something else.

Wait, another approach: let's consider the possible molecular formulas and see which one fits.

The options are:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

So all are C6, varying H and O.

Let me compute the degree of unsaturation for each.

Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since all are C6, and no X or N, DoU = (2*6 +2 - H)/2.

So:

A) C6H12O2: H=12. DoU = (14 -12)/2 = 2/2=1. So 1 DoU, which could be a ring or a double bond or two rings or a double bond and a ring.

B) C6H10O: H=10. DoU=(14-10)/2=4/2=2. So two degrees. Could be two double bonds, a ring and a double bond, etc.

C) C6H10O2: H=10. So same as B: DoU = (14-10)/2=2.

D) C6H12O: H=12. DoU= (14-12)/2=1.

So, what's the structure?

From the NMR, we have vinyl hydrogens, implying a double bond. So that's one DoU. If the compound has another double bond or a ring, that would account for the DoU.

Looking at the IR: the broad peak suggests an -OH group, and the 1700 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl (C=O). So the functional groups are likely an alcohol and a carbonyl.

So, the compound probably has a structure like an aromatic ring with substituents, maybe an ester group and a double bond or something else.

Wait, but wait. Let's think. Alternatively, maybe a cyclic ester (lactone)? That would have a carbonyl and an ether linkage. Or maybe an ester group, which is O-C-O.

But the mass spec fragment at 45: What could that be? Let me think about the possible structures.

Option A: C6H12O2. DoU=1. That could be a ring and an ester group, but no double bond. But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which require a double bond. So DoU=1, but includes a double bond? Or a ring.

Wait, DoU=1 could be a ring (like cyclohexane) plus an ester group. But then where's the double bond? Hmm, unless I'm miscalculating.

Wait, let me recheck DoU for option A. C6H12O2: 6 carbons, 12 hydrogens.

DoU = (2*6 + 2 - 12)/2 = (14 - 12)/2 = 2/2 = 1. So one degree. So either one ring, one double bond, or a ring plus a double bond (but that would be 2 DoU, so no). So if there's a double bond, then the rest must account for another DoU, but option A only allows one.

Wait, that can't be. So if the compound has a double bond (which is one DoU), then the other DoU must come from something else. So that would require a ring or another double bond. But option A has only one DoU, so that's a problem. Because the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens (a double bond), so DoU must be at least 1. Plus, any rings or other double bonds would bring DoU higher.

Wait, but maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me make a table.

Option A: C6H12O2.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 1.

So one DoU. That could be one ring or one double bond.

But the NMR shows vinyl Hs, meaning a double bond. So if the compound has a double bond (DoU=1), then the structure must have that. But then what about the O's? It has two oxygen atoms.

So C6H12O2 with a double bond—so DoU=1 (double bond) and maybe an ester group which has an oxygen. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's an ester with a double bond. For example, something like methyl vinyl acetate? Not sure. Let me think.

Option B: C6H10O: DoU=2.

So two DoU. That could be a ring and a double bond. Or two double bonds, but that's less likely.

Option C: C6H10O2: DoU=2.

So two DoU. That could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

Option D: C6H12O: DoU=1. So one DoU. If it's a double bond, then other structure.

But the NMR shows vinyl Hs, so the compound must have a double bond. So all options except maybe D must have a double bond.

Wait, D has DoU=1, so if that's a double bond, then it's just one double bond. So the structure could have a double bond, and that's it. But what about the O? It's one oxygen. So perhaps an alcohol with a double bond.

Wait, but the IR shows a broad peak, which could be an alcohol's O-H.

So perhaps it's an allylic alcohol, like an allyl alcohol.

But let's look at the IR again. The strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. If it's an allylic alcohol, the 1700 might not fit. Because an allyl alcohol would have an -OH and a double bond. The 1700 is a carbonyl. So maybe the compound has both a carbonyl and a double bond.

Hmm, so that suggests that the compound has a carbonyl group and a double bond. So the DoU would be at least 2 (one for the double bond, one for the carbonyl).

Wait, no. Because a carbonyl is a double bond (C=O), which is a double bond, so that's one DoU. The C=C is another DoU. So that's two DoU.

So the molecular formula must have at least two DoU. Let's see which options have that.

Option B: DoU=2.

Option C: DoU=2.

Options A and D have DoU=1, which might not be enough unless the DoU comes from another source.

But wait, the IR has a C=O (which is a carbonyl, so that's one DoU), and the NMR shows a double bond (another DoU). So total DoU is 2. So the formula must have two DoU.

So looking back, which options have DoU=2?

B: C6H10O: DoU=2.

C: C6H10O2: DoU=2.

So A and D have DoU=1, which can't account for both the C=O and the C=C.

So that leaves us with B and C.

Now, let's think about the molecular formulas.

The IR has a strong peak at 1700, which is a carbonyl. So, the compound has a carbonyl group. So possible functional groups are ketone, aldehyde, ester, acid, etc.

Option B is C6H10O. So the formula would have one O. If it's a carbonyl, that O is part of the carbonyl. So, for example, if it's a ketone (O in C=O), but then where's the -OH from the broad IR peak? Wait, the IR showed a broad peak at 3000, which would be an O-H from an alcohol or maybe a phenol. So if the compound has both a ketone and an alcohol group, that would require two O's. But option B only has one O.

Ah, that's a problem. So option B (C6H10O) can't have both a carbonyl group (O) and an O-H (another O), which would require two O's. So option B is out.

So that leaves option C: C6H10O2.

Which has two O's. So one O could be in the carbonyl (C=O), and the other could be in an O-H group (like an alcohol or carboxylic acid). But the broad peak in IR suggests an O-H from an alcohol (since carboxylic acids have very broad peaks, which might match, but let's see).

So the structure would have a carbonyl (maybe ester, ketone, etc.), an alcohol group, and a double bond (from the NMR vinyl H's).

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ester (lactone), but that would have a carbonyl and an ether linkage. Wait, but if it's a lactone, the O would be part of the ester, and maybe another O as an alcohol. But cyclic esters don't have a free -OH, so that might not fit the broad IR peak.

Alternatively, maybe it's an ester with an alcohol group elsewhere. But that seems less likely.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the mass spectrum. The fragment at m/z=45.

What's the molecular weight of possible fragments? 45 is a common mass for (CH3)2O (which is 45), but wait, (CH3)2O is 45? Let me calculate: 2*(12+3) + 16 = 2*15 +16=30+16=46. No, that's 46. Hmm, so that can't be.

Wait, another common fragment at 45 is the CH2O group, which is formaldehyde (formaldehyde is 30, but that's not right). Alternatively, maybe it's the propyl group or something else.

Wait, the molecular formula for the compound is either C6H10O2 or C6H10O. Since we've narrowed it down to C being C6H10O2, let's see.

Another approach: perhaps the 45 comes from a methyl ester group or something. Wait, methyl group is 15, but that's not adding up. Alternatively, maybe a fragment like CH2=CH-O- something.

Wait, another thought: the fragment at 45 could be the tropylium ion (C7H7+), but that's 91, which doesn't match. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the compound is something like methyl propenoate. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, think about the possible structures. If the compound is an ester with a double bond, perhaps something like methyl vinyl acetate. Let me think about its structure. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: molecular formula C6H10O2 could be something like an ester, like methyl something. Or perhaps a cyclic ester. Alternatively, perhaps a di-substituted benzene ring with an ester and an alcohol group, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, considering the IR peaks: 1700 (carbonyl) and 1650 (conjugated double bond). So maybe it's an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. That would have a structure like CH2=CHCOOR. That way, the carbonyl is conjugated with the double bond.

So if the structure is like that, then the mass spec fragment of 45 might come from the ester part. For example, the ester group (like O-C-O) could break off. But wait, the ester group is O-C-O, which in the fragment would perhaps lose some parts.

Alternatively, the fragment at 45 could be a methyl group attached to something. Or perhaps a CH2=CH-O group, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought. Let's compute the molecular weight of each option. The molecular weight would be:

A) C6H12O2: 6*12 +12 + 2*16 = 72 +12 +32 = 116.

B) C6H10O: 72 +10 +16 = 98.

C) C6H10O2:72 +10 +32=114.

D) C6H12O:72 +12 +16=100.

But the mass spec gives a fragment at m/z=45, which is less than the molecular weight of the compound. So that suggests that the fragment is a part of the molecule, not the entire molecule.

Hmm, but I'm not sure how that helps. Alternatively, perhaps the base peak is at 45, which could correspond to a functional group.

Wait, another approach: for each possible formula, what would be the possible structure that includes a carbonyl and a double bond, and an -OH group.

Option C: C6H10O2.

Possible structure: An ester with a double bond and an -OH. Or maybe a diol with a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps it's a substituted benzaldehyde with an ester group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic structure. Let me think about the possible structures.

Wait, let me think about the possible molecular weight. If the compound is C6H10O2, molecular weight is 114. If the fragment is 45, that's about 40% of the molecular weight. So perhaps it's losing some part, like a fragment that's 45 and the rest is 69.

But I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, another angle: the presence of an ester group (O-C-O) would lead to certain fragments. For example, the ester group can break into the alkoxy part and the acylium part. If the ester is, say, methyl, then the alkoxy part would be OCH3 (31), but that's not 45. Alternatively, if it's ethyl, OCH2CH3 (46), which is close to 45 but not exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from the acylium ion, but that's usually higher mass.

Wait, maybe the fragment is from a ketene group or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an aromatic ester, and the fragment comes from the loss of the aromatic ring, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from a CH2CO group. Wait, CH2CO has a molecular weight of 43 (12 + 2 +12 +16 =43). Hmm, not 45.

Wait, another thought: maybe the fragment is from a CH2=CH-O group. Let's calculate that. CH2=CH-O has a molecular weight of 12*2 + 2 +16 = 44. Close to 45 but not exactly. Alternatively, perhaps a CH2=CH-O-CH3 group, but that would be 44 +15=59, which is higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from a CH2=CH-O- group losing a proton, but that's getting too speculative.

Maybe I should consider the possible structures again.

Option C: C6H10O2.

If the structure is an ester, for example, something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3, but that's 7 carbons, so not 6.

Wait, perhaps it's an ester with a substituted vinyl group. For example, maybe it's an ester with a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl, like CH2=CHCOOR, but then the R group would have to be small.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ester with a double bond. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the structure could be something like methyl vinyl benzoate, but that would have more carbons.

Wait, perhaps it's a substituted cyclohexene with an ester group and an -OH. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituted furan ester, but that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, the compound could be an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester, like CH2=CHCOOCH3. But then the formula would be C5H8O2. Hmm, but our options are C6. So maybe it's a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3. Let's calculate the formula: 2 (from CH2=CH-) + 2 (from CH2COO-) +2 (from CH2CH3) → that's 2+2+2=6 carbons. Hydrogens: CH2=CH (3 Hs per CH2, but double bond reduces by 2 Hs) → CH2=CH has 3 H (each CH2 has 2, but the double bond is CH2=CH-: so CH2:2 H and CH:1 H → 3 H). Then CH2COO has 3 H (CH2), then OCH2CH3 has 5 H (OCH2CH3: 2 from OCH2 and 3 from CH3). Wait, maybe I'm not calculating correctly.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the actual formula for the structure.

If the structure is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3 (ethyl acrylate), the formula is C5H8O2. But our option is C6H10O2. So perhaps it's a longer chain.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH2CH3, which would be C7H12O2. Hmm, that's too big.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with substituents, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the possible formula for the m/z=45 fragment.

What molecular formulas have a mass of 45? Let's compute.

Possible fragments:

- C3H7O: (3*12) +7 +16 = 36 +7 +16=59 → No.

Wait, 45 can be:

1. C3H9O: 3*12 +9 +16=36+9+16=61 → No.

2. C2H5O2: 2*12 +5 +32=24+5+32=61 → No.

3. C4H3O: 4*12 +3 +16=48+3+16=67 → No.

Wait, maybe it's C3H3O+? 3*12 +3 +16=36+3+16=55. No.

Wait, another approach: 45 could be CH3CO+ (which is 43), but that's not 45. Alternatively, maybe (CH3)2CHO+ → But that's 59.

Hmm, perhaps it's a different group. Maybe it's a ketene ion, but that's 44. Not 45.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment could be a toluene-like ion (methylbenzene), but that's 93. No.

Alternatively, maybe it's the loss of a fragment of 45 from the parent molecule. So the parent is, say, 114 (C6H10O2), and losing a 45 fragment would leave 69, which could be a possible structure. But I'm not sure what that would look like.

Alternatively, perhaps the 45 is from the ester part. If the ester group is something like CH3O, that's 32, but not 45.

Wait, another possible fragment is the loss of an acetylium ion (CH3CO+) which is 43, but that's not 45. Alternatively, perhaps it's a propenoylium ion (CH2=CHCO+) which is 57, but again, not matching.

Hmm, I'm not making much progress with the mass spec. Let me go back to the other data.

So, the compound has a carbonyl (1700 cm⁻¹), a conjugated double bond (1650 cm⁻¹), an O-H group (broad peak at 3000), and a double bond (from NMR).

The formula must be C6H10O2 (option C) because it's the only one with two O's, allowing for both the carbonyl and the O-H group, and the DoU is 2, which fits with a double bond and a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of two carbonyl peaks isn't the case. Wait, wait. The IR shows strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. If one is a carbonyl and the other is a conjugated C=C, that fits.

So, given all that, option C is C6H10O2. Let's see if that makes sense.

So the structure could be something like an ester with a double bond, like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. Wait, that's 7 carbons. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps a cyclopentene ring with an ester group. Or maybe a benzene ring with substituents.

Wait, another thought. The formula C6H10O2 could be a substituted benzaldehyde with an ester group. For example, a benzene ring with a CHO group and an OMe group. But that would have a benzaldehyde (CHO) and an ester (OCH3), but I'm not sure.

Wait, but then the NMR would show aromatic protons, but the question doesn't mention that. The NMR only mentions vinyl hydrogens, not aromatic. So maybe the compound doesn't have a benzene ring, just an isolated double bond.

Putting it all together, the compound is likely an ester with a double bond and an -OH group. But I'm not entirely certain, but given all the data, I think option C is the right answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The unknown compound is analyzed using FTIR, ¹H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR spectrum shows a broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹, indicating the presence of an O-H group (likely from an alcohol). Strong absorption peaks at 1700 cm⁻¹ and 1650 cm⁻¹ suggest the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and a conjugated double bond (C=C). The ¹H NMR spectrum confirms the presence of vinyl hydrogens, indicating a double bond in the structure. The Mass Spectrometry data shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45, which is consistent with common fragments such as CH2=CH-O or related groups.

The molecular formulas provided are analyzed for their degrees of unsaturation (DoU):

- **A) C6H12O2**: DoU = 1. This formula allows for either a single ring or a single double bond, but the compound must have both a carbonyl (C=O) and a double bond (C=C), requiring at least two DoU. Thus, this option is insufficient.
- **B) C6H10O**: DoU = 2. While this formula allows for two degrees of unsaturation (e.g., a double bond and a carbonyl), it has only one oxygen atom, which cannot account for both the carbonyl group and the O-H group observed in the IR spectrum. Therefore, this option is also insufficient.
- **C) C6H10O2**: DoU = 2. This formula allows for two degrees of unsaturation, which can accommodate both the carbonyl group and the double bond. Additionally, the two oxygen atoms can account for both the carbonyl group and the O-H group observed in the IR spectrum. This makes it a strong candidate.
- **D) C6H12O**: DoU = 1. Similar to option A, this formula only allows for one degree of unsaturation, which is insufficient to account for both the carbonyl group and the double bond. Thus, this option is also insufficient.

Given the spectroscopic data and the analysis of the molecular formulas, **C6H10O2** is the most consistent with all the observations. It accounts for the carbonyl group, the conjugated double bond, the O-H group, and the mass spectrometry fragment at m/z = 45.

Answer: C
