Okay, so I have this question about a textile dye emitting light with a certain energy, and I need to find out what color it absorbs. Hmm, I remember that when something emits light, it's because it's releasing energy, right? And the color it emits is related to the energy of the light. But wait, the question is about the color absorbed, not emitted. Oh right, because when a substance absorbs a certain wavelength, it emits the complementary color.

Wait, so the dye emits light at 2.3393 eV. I think I remember that the energy of light is inversely related to its wavelength. The formula E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, and λ is wavelength. So higher energy means shorter wavelength, lower energy means longer wavelength.

The visible spectrum goes from violet (shorter wavelength, higher energy) to red (longer wavelength, lower energy). So I need to figure out where 2.3393 eV falls in the visible range.

I recall that the energy levels of photons in the visible spectrum are roughly between about 1.8 eV (red) and 3.0 eV (violet). Let me think: 2.3393 is somewhere in the middle. Let me calculate the wavelength to be more precise.

The energy E is given in eV, so I can convert that to joules. 1 eV is 1.602 x 10^-19 joules. So 2.3393 eV is 2.3393 * 1.602e-19 J ≈ 3.745e-19 J.

Then using E = hc/λ, solving for λ gives λ = hc/E.

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s. c is 3.0e8 m/s.

Plugging in the numbers: λ = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (3.745e-19) → let me compute that.

Wait, let's compute the numerator first: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25.

Divide by 3.745e-19: 1.9878e-25 / 3.745e-19 = approximately 5.31e-7 meters. Because 1e-7 meters is 100 nm, so 531 nm. Wait, 531 nm is in the green part of the spectrum. But wait, the question is about the absorbed color, not the emitted.

Wait, no—wait a second. The dye emits light when it loses energy, right? So the emitted light would be the complementary color of the absorbed. So if the dye emits green (around 530 nm), then it must have absorbed the complementary color. Wait, the complementary color of green is magenta or red? Or maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, I think I should think in terms of the energy. The dye emits at 2.3393 eV, which is about 531 nm (green). But when a substance emits light, it's because it's dropping from a higher energy state to a lower one. The energy difference is the photon emitted. But the color it absorbs would be the energy it's transitioning to. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this mixed up.

Wait, no. The dye absorbs certain wavelengths and emits others. The energy difference between the excited state and the ground state determines the emitted photon. So if the dye emits at 2.3393 eV (green), that's the energy difference between the two states. The absorbed light would be higher energy? Or lower?

Wait, when a molecule absorbs light, it gets excited to a higher energy state. So the energy of the absorbed photon has to be higher than the energy difference between the ground and excited states. Or wait, no. The energy of the absorbed photon must match the energy gap. Because when the molecule absorbs a photon, it gets excited. So the energy of that photon is the energy of the transition.

Wait, that's a key point. The energy of the emitted photon is the same as the energy of the absorbed photon if it's a simple two-level system. But in reality, molecules have more complex energy levels, so maybe multiple transitions happen.

Wait, but in this question, the dye emits light at 2.3393 eV. That emission is when it drops from an excited state to a lower state. So the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. Therefore, the energy of the absorbed photon when the molecule is initially excited must be higher than that? Or is it the same?

Wait, no. The emission is the energy difference between the two states. So when the molecule absorbs a photon, it goes from ground state to excited state with energy E. Then, when it relaxes, it emits a photon of energy E. So the absorption and emission have the same energy. But wait, that can't be right because if that's the case, the color absorbed and emitted would be the same. But in reality, sometimes substances have more than two energy levels, but in this question, perhaps it's a simple case.

Wait, perhaps the question is implying that the emitted light is at 2.3393 eV, so the wavelength is 531 nm (green). But the absorbed light would be in the complementary color. Wait, no, that's not correct. The absorption spectrum is where the molecule absorbs, which would correspond to the energy difference. So if the molecule emits green light, that's the energy it releases when it relaxes, which suggests that the absorbed light is the same energy—green. But that can't be right because then the dye would be green, but dyes are usually colored based on the complementary color they absorb.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. So let me think again. The color we see is the color that is reflected or transmitted, which is the complementary color of the absorbed. If a dye emits green, that would mean it's absorbing the complementary color of green, which is magenta. But that's not one of the options. The options are red, violet, blue, or yellow.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the absorbed light's color being the same as the emitted? No, that doesn't make sense. Because if the dye emits green, it's reflecting/transmitting green, which means the dye itself must be green. But if a dye is green, it absorbs the complementary, which is magenta, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the energy and the wavelength for absorption. So the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. But the energy of the absorbed photon would be higher if the molecule goes from a lower energy state to a higher one. Wait, but in fluorescence, the emitted photon has lower energy than the absorbed one. Because when the molecule absorbs a higher energy photon, it gets excited, and then when it relaxes, it emits a lower energy photon.

Ah, so that makes sense. So the energy of the emitted photon is lower than the absorbed one. Therefore, the absorbed photon would have higher energy than 2.3393 eV. So what color is higher energy? Violet has higher energy than green.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me outline:

- Energy (eV) of emitted light: 2.3393 eV.
- Emitted wavelength: ~531 nm (green).
- The absorbed photon must have higher energy because the molecule absorbs higher energy to get excited, then emits lower energy when it relaxes.

So the absorbed photon's wavelength is shorter (higher energy) than green. So the absorbed photon would be in the blue or violet range.

Looking at the options, the question is asking what color is absorbed. The options are A) Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow.

So if the emitted is green, the absorbed must be a higher energy color, so either blue or violet.

What's the energy corresponding to blue and violet?

Green: around 530 nm, as above.

Blue is around 450-495 nm. Violet is around 380-450 nm.

Compute energy for blue and violet.

Assuming blue is at 450 nm: E = 1240 eV·nm / 450 nm ≈ 2.756 eV.

Violet at 400 nm: 1240 /400 =3.1 eV.

So the absorbed photon is higher than 2.3393 eV.

The options are violet (3.1 eV) and blue (2.756 eV). So the absorbed light is either blue or violet.

But wait, the question is about the color absorbed. So the dye would have a peak in its absorption spectrum at higher energy than the emission.

So the emitted light is 2.3393 eV (green), so the absorbed light must be higher, let's say 3.1 eV (violet) or 2.75 eV (blue).

So which one is it? The question is about the color absorbed. The options are B) Violet and C) Blue.

If the dye emits green, which is 531 nm, the absorbed light would be at a higher energy (shorter wavelength), which is blue or violet.

So which color is absorbed? The problem is, the question gives the energy of the emitted light, and asks for the absorbed color.

Wait, maybe the question is phrased incorrectly, but perhaps it's implying that the emitted light is the complement of the absorbed. So if the dye emits green, it's absorbing magenta (which is not an option), but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy of the absorbed light is the same as the emitted. Then, the color would be green, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I got it wrong earlier. Wait, when a molecule emits light, that light is the result of a transition between two energy levels. The energy of the emitted photon is the difference between those two levels. So the energy of the absorbed photon must be the same, right? Because absorption and emission are reverse processes. So perhaps the energy of the absorbed and emitted photon is the same. But wait, that would imply the same color, but then that's not matching the options.

Wait, but in the case of fluorescence, the energy of the emitted photon is lower than the absorbed. Because when the molecule is excited, it can lose some energy (e.g., through collisions) before emitting a photon. So the emitted photon is lower in energy than the absorbed.

So in that case, the absorbed photon would be higher in energy than the emitted. So the emitted is 2.3393 eV (green), so the absorbed is higher, say blue or violet.

So in the options, the colors with higher energy than green are violet (3.1 eV) and blue (around 2.75 eV).

So the question is, which color is absorbed, meaning the dye absorbs which color. Since the emitted is green, the absorbed must be higher than green.

So the options are B and C. But which one?

Wait, 2.3393 eV is approximately 531 nm (green). So the absorbed photon must be higher than that, so shorter wavelength. So the absorbed color has higher energy.

So between blue (around 2.75 eV) and violet (3.1 eV), which is higher than 2.3393.

So the absorbed color is either blue or violet.

But the question is, which color is absorbed. So the dye's absorption peak is in the higher energy region.

The question is about the color absorbed. So the dye probably absorbs in the higher energy range, which is blue or violet.

Now, looking at the options, the possible answers are B) Violet and C) Blue.

But how to decide between them.

Wait, let me compute the exact wavelength for 2.3393 eV.

E (eV) = 1240 nm·eV / λ(nm)

So λ = 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ 531 nm, which is green.

So the emitted light is green. Therefore, the dye must absorb light of higher energy (lower wavelength) than green.

So, the absorption is in the blue or violet range.

But what's the exact energy for blue and violet?

Blue is around 450 nm: E = 1240 /450 ≈ 2.756 eV.

Violet is around 400 nm: E=3.1 eV.

So 2.3393 eV is green, the absorbed would be higher.

So the options are B) Violet (3.1 eV) and C) Blue (2.75 eV).

But the question is about the color absorbed. So the dye absorbs either blue or violet.

But how to choose between the two.

Wait, perhaps the answer is violet, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the visible spectrum's color wavelengths.

Wait, the visible spectrum ranges from about 380 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). So blue is around 450-495 nm. So the energy for blue is 2.756 eV, as above.

In this case, 2.3393 eV is lower than blue's energy, so the absorbed photon is higher, meaning bluer (violet or blue).

But in the options, B is violet and C is blue.

The question is about the color absorbed. So the dye that emits green (531 nm) must absorb light of higher energy, so either blue or violet.

But without more data, perhaps the answer expects the absorption to be in the blue region, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: the energy levels. The molecule has an excited state and ground state. The energy difference is 2.3393 eV, which is the emitted photon. So the absorbed photon must have the same energy? Or higher?

Wait, in fluorescence, the molecule absorbs a higher energy photon (for excitation) and emits a lower energy photon. So the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than the emitted.

Therefore, the absorbed photon's energy is higher than 2.3393 eV. So looking at the options, the colors with higher energy than green are violet and blue.

So the absorbed color is either violet or blue.

But how to decide between the two. Since the question is about the color absorbed, perhaps the correct answer is violet, as it has a higher energy than blue.

Wait, the options are A) Red (lower than 2.3393 eV, since red is around 1.8 eV), so not the absorbed. D) Yellow is around 2.0 eV, which is lower than 2.3393, so not the absorbed.

So the options for absorbed are B) Violet and C) Blue.

But which one is correct?

Well, 2.3393 eV is approximately 531 nm (green). The absorbed photon must be higher in energy, so shorter wavelength. The blue light is around 450 nm (E=2.756 eV), which is higher than 2.3393.

Violet is at 400 nm (E=3.1 eV), higher than that.

So the question is, does the dye absorb violet or blue?

Well, without more specific data, perhaps the answer is B) Violet.

Wait, another approach: the question says that the dye has an extensively conjugated pi-electron system. Extensive conjugation usually leads to lower energy gaps, which correspond to longer wavelengths (lower energy) for absorption. Wait, no. Wait, conjugation increases the extent of the pi system, which leads to a lower energy gap between molecular orbitals. Lower energy gap corresponds to longer wavelength (lower energy) absorption. So if the conjugation is extensive, the absorption wavelength would be longer (lower energy) than a less conjugated system.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. The energy gap between molecular orbitals in conjugated systems: more conjugation leads to smaller energy gaps. Because the energy levels are closer together as the molecule becomes more conjugated. So smaller energy gaps correspond to longer wavelengths (lower energy) for absorption.

So a highly conjugated system would absorb lower energy (longer wavelength) light. So the absorption maximum would be in the longer wavelength, lower energy region.

Wait, but wait, the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV (green, 531 nm). If the absorbed photon is higher in energy (shorter wavelength), then a highly conjugated system would have a smaller energy gap, meaning lower energy (longer wavelength) for absorption. Hmm, this is getting confusing.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the molecule's energy levels. When the molecule absorbs a photon, it goes from a lower energy level to a higher one. The energy of the photon must be equal to the energy difference.

If the molecule has a large conjugated system, the energy gap between the ground and excited states is smaller. So the absorbed photon would have lower energy (longer wavelength) than a less conjugated system.

Wait, but in this problem, the emitted light is 2.3393 eV (green). The absorption must be higher, so a smaller conjugated system would have a larger energy gap, requiring higher energy (shorter wavelength) photons for absorption.

But the question states that the dye has an extensively conjugated pi-electrons system. Which would imply a smaller energy gap, so the absorption would be at a lower energy (longer wavelength) than if it were less conjugated.

Wait, but wait: if the molecule has a large conjugated system, the energy gap is smaller. So the energy required for the transition (the absorbed photon's energy) is smaller. But in our case, the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed photon must be higher than that, as per fluorescence.

Hmm this is getting complicated. Let me try to outline:

Emission energy: 2.3393 eV (green, 531 nm).

Absorption energy: higher than 2.3393 eV → shorter wavelength.

But the molecule is extensively conjugated → smaller energy gap → lower energy for transition.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because if the molecule is more conjugated, the energy gap is smaller, so the absorption would be at a lower energy (longer wavelength) than a less conjugated system.

But in our case, the emission is 2.3393 eV, which is green. The absorption must be higher, so a smaller conjugated system would have a larger energy gap, requiring higher energy photons.

Wait, but the question says the molecule has an extensively conjugated system, which would have a smaller energy gap. So the absorption energy would be lower than that of a less conjugated system.

But in our case, the absorption must be higher than emission. So this is conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's go back.

The energy of the emitted photon is the energy difference between the ground state and the excited state. So the absorbed photon must have that same energy, but in fluorescence, the emitted photon is lower in energy than the absorbed, because some energy is lost as heat during the transition.

Wait, in fluorescence, the molecule absorbs a higher energy photon, becomes excited, loses some energy (e.g., through vibrations), and then emits a lower energy photon.

So the energy of the emitted photon (E_emit) is less than the absorbed (E_absorb).

So E_absorb > E_emit.

In our case, E_emit = 2.3393 eV. So E_absorb must be higher than that.

So E_absorb must be in the range higher than 2.3393 eV, which are violet and blue.

So the absorbed photon is either blue or violet.

But the question is, which color is absorbed.

Now, the options are B) Violet and C) Blue.

But without more information, I can't say for sure, but perhaps the question expects the absorption to be in the blue region.

Wait, but 2.3393 eV is green, which is about 530 nm. So the absorbed photon would be higher, so shorter wavelength.

Let me compute the wavelength for 2.3393 eV.

E = 2.3393 eV.

λ = 1240 / E = 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ 531 nm (green).

The absorbed photon's energy must be higher, so λ = 1240 / E.

If E_absorb is higher than 2.3393, the wavelength is shorter than 531 nm.

So for example, if E_absorb is 2.5 eV, λ = 496 nm → blue.

If E_absorb is 3.0 eV, λ=413 nm → violet.

So the absorbed light is either blue or violet.

Now, the question is which of the options is correct.

The options are B) Violet and C) Blue.

But how to decide.

Wait, perhaps the absorption is in the blue region, and the emitted is green. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the conjugated system's absorption is in the visible range. Extensive conjugation usually leads to absorption in the visible region.

Wait, with an extensively conjugated system, the HOMO-LUMO gap is smaller, so the absorption is at longer wavelengths (lower energy). But in our case, the absorption must be higher than the emission (because E_absorb > E_emit).

Wait, this is getting too complicated, but perhaps the answer is Violet.

Wait, if the question gives the emitted as green (531 nm, 2.3393 eV), then the absorbed light would be in the higher energy (shorter wavelength) region. So blue is 450 nm (2.756 eV), violet is 400 nm (3.1 eV).

Which is higher than 2.3393 eV? Both are, but the question is which color is absorbed.

So the correct answer is either B or C.

But looking at the options again:

Options are A) Red (low energy), B) Violet (high energy), C) Blue (medium), D) Yellow (medium).

So the absorbed must be either B or C.

But the energy of emitted is in the middle, green. So the absorbed is higher than that.

Now, I think the correct answer is B) Violet.

Wait, but why?

Wait, think about the color wheel. Green is between blue and yellow. The complementary color of green is magenta, which isn't an option.

But the question is about the absorbed color, not the emitted. So the dye emits green, which means it absorbed the higher energy photon, which could be violet or blue.

But without more information, perhaps the best approach is to find which option falls in higher energy than 2.3393 eV.

B) Violet is 3.1 eV, which is higher.

C) Blue is around 2.756 eV, which is also higher.

So both options B and C have higher energy than emitted.

But the question is, which is the color absorbed.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the complementary color.

Wait, the color we see is the color that's not absorbed. So if a dye emits green, it reflects/transmits green. Therefore, it absorbs the complementary color, which is magenta. But magenta isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the other way around: the emitted color is the color that's transmitted, and the absorbed is the other. So if the dye emits green, it must have absorbed the other colors. But that's not how it works. The color we see is the color that's not absorbed.

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me think differently.

Dyes absorb certain wavelengths and transmit the complementary. So if a dye appears green, it must be absorbing the complementary color, which is magenta. But again, that's not an option.

But wait, the question is about the color absorbed, not the color of the dye. The emitted light is 2.3393 eV (green), so the dye emits green. But the absorbed light must be higher energy.

So the absorbed color is either blue or violet.

But without knowing the exact energy, perhaps the answer is violet, as it's the higher energy.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the color absorbed to be the same as the emitted. But that's not the case.

Wait, another approach: the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, so the color it emits is green. The question is what color is absorbed.

But the question is a bit tricky because when a molecule emits a photon, it's because it's losing energy. So the emitted photon's energy is the energy difference between the two states. So the absorbed photon's energy must be higher than that, as the molecule must gain energy to reach the excited state.

So in this case, the absorbed photon must have higher energy than 2.3393 eV.

Looking at the options, B is violet (3.1 eV), which is higher. C is blue (2.75 eV), which is also higher.

So which option is correct?

Wait, perhaps the answer is B) Violet.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the absorption is in the blue region, so the answer is C) Blue.

Hmm, I think I'm overcomplicating this. The key point is that the absorbed photon has higher energy than the emitted.

In the options, both B and C are higher.

So perhaps the intended answer is B) Violet, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the energy levels. The molecule in an excited state emits a photon of energy E_emit. So the energy gap between the ground and excited state is E_emit.

When the molecule absorbs a photon of energy E_absorb, which must be equal to E_emit plus any energy lost, but in reality, E_absorb is the same as E_emit? Or higher?

Wait, no, because in fluorescence, the molecule must absorb a photon higher in energy than the emitted. Because the molecule loses some energy between absorption and emission.

So, E_absorb must be higher than E_emit.

So, in this case, E_absorb must be higher than 2.3393 eV.

So, the only options are B (Violet) and C (Blue), which are higher.

But which one?

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is blue.

Wait, another thought: the emission energy is 2.3393 eV, which is green. The absorbed energy is higher, so it's in the blue or violet. But without knowing the exact value, perhaps the question expects blue as the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the emitted photon is the same as the absorbed, but that doesn't make sense because then the dye would be green, but the question is about absorption.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is reversed. Let me read the question again.

Question: A textile dye containing an extensively conjugated pi-electrons emits light with energy of 2.3393 eV. What color of light is absorbed by the organic compound?

So the dye emits green (2.3393 eV). It must absorb a higher energy photon (blue or violet).

So the correct answer is either B) Violet or C) Blue.

But how to choose.

Wait, another thought: the energy of 2.3393 eV is 531 nm (green). The absorbed energy would be higher, so the color would be either blue (450 nm, 2.756 eV) or violet (400 nm, 3.1 eV).

Now, the question is to pick between these two.

But without more data, perhaps the intended answer is blue.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is blue because the question says the molecule is extensively conjugated. Extensive conjugation leads to lower energy (longer wavelength) absorption. But wait, the absorption must be higher than the emission energy.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. If the molecule is extensively conjugated, the absorption is at a longer wavelength (lower energy), but in this case, the absorption must be shorter wavelength (higher energy) than green.

So if the molecule is more conjugated, the absorption band would be at a longer wavelength. But in this case, the absorption must be shorter than green.

Hmm, this seems conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the complementary color.

Wait, the dye emits green; therefore, it must absorb magenta. But magenta isn't an option. So perhaps the reasoning is incorrect.

Alternatively, the question is asking about the color absorbed, which is the same as the color of the emitted photon?

No, that can't be right because the dye would then be transparent, which isn't the case.

Wait, perhaps I should just conclude that the answer is B) Violet.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, maybe it's blue.

Wait, the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV. Let's see the position of this in the visible spectrum.

2.3393 eV → 531 nm → green.

Absorption must be higher energy, so blue (450 nm) is higher than green, and violet (400 nm) is even higher.

So blue is 2.756 eV, which is higher than 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed photon could be blue or violet.

But which is more likely? The question doesn't provide more info, so perhaps I should pick the higher energy option, which is violet.

Therefore, the correct answer would be B) Violet.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the color of light absorbed by the textile dye, we start by analyzing the energy of the emitted light. The dye emits light with an energy of **2.3393 eV**, which corresponds to a wavelength of approximately **531 nm** (green light). The energy of light is inversely related to its wavelength, as described by the equation:

\[
E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]

where \(E\) is the energy, \(h\) is Planck's constant, \(c\) is the speed of light, and \(\lambda\) is the wavelength. A higher energy corresponds to a shorter wavelength, while a lower energy corresponds to a longer wavelength.

In fluorescence, the energy of the emitted photon is typically lower than the energy of the absorbed photon because the molecule loses some energy (e.g., as heat) during the transition from the excited state to the ground state. Therefore, the absorbed photon must have higher energy than the emitted photon.

The energy of the emitted photon is **2.3393 eV**, so the absorbed photon must have an energy greater than this value. The visible spectrum ranges from violet (380 nm, 3.1 eV) to red (700 nm, 1.8 eV). Among the options provided:

- **A) Red**: 1.8 eV (lower than 2.3393 eV, not possible for absorption).
- **B) Violet**: 3.1 eV (higher than 2.3393 eV, possible for absorption).
- **C) Blue**: 2.756 eV (higher than 2.3393 eV, possible for absorption).
- **D) Yellow**: 2.0 eV (lower than 2.3393 eV, not possible for absorption).

Both violet (3.1 eV) and blue (2.756 eV) have higher energy than the emitted photon (2.3393 eV). However, the question does not provide additional details about the specific energy gap of the dye or its conjugation effects. Extensive conjugation typically reduces the energy gap, leading to absorption at longer wavelengths (lower energy), but the absorption must still be higher than the emitted energy in this case.

Given the options, the most reasonable conclusion is that the absorbed light is **violet**, as it represents the higher energy option. 

**Answer: B**

Okay, so I have this question about a textile dye emitting light with a certain energy, and I need to find out what color it absorbs. Hmm, I remember that when something emits light, it's because it's releasing energy, right? And the color it emits is related to the energy of the light. But wait, the question is about the color absorbed, not emitted. Oh right, because when a substance absorbs a certain wavelength, it emits the complementary color.

Wait, so the dye emits light at 2.3393 eV. I think I remember that the energy of light is inversely related to its wavelength. The formula E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, and λ is wavelength. So higher energy means shorter wavelength, lower energy means longer wavelength.

The visible spectrum goes from violet (shorter wavelength, higher energy) to red (longer wavelength, lower energy). So I need to figure out where 2.3393 eV falls in the visible range.

I recall that the energy levels of photons in the visible spectrum are roughly between about 1.8 eV (red) and 3.0 eV (violet). Let me think: 2.3393 is somewhere in the middle. Let me calculate the wavelength to be more precise.

The energy E is given in eV, so I can convert that to joules. 1 eV is 1.602 x 10^-19 joules. So 2.3393 eV is 2.3393 * 1.602e-19 J ≈ 3.745e-19 J.

Then using E = hc/λ, solving for λ gives λ = hc/E.

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s. c is 3.0e8 m/s.

Plugging in the numbers: λ = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (3.745e-19) → let me compute that.

Wait, let's compute the numerator first: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25.

Divide by 3.745e-19: 1.9878e-25 / 3.745e-19 = approximately 5.31e-7 meters. Because 1e-7 meters is 100 nm, so 531 nm. Wait, 531 nm is in the green part of the spectrum. But wait, the question is about the absorbed color, not the emitted.

Wait, no—wait a second. The dye emits light when it loses energy, right? So the emitted light would be the complementary color of the absorbed. So if the dye emits green (around 530 nm), then it must have absorbed the complementary color. Wait, the complementary color of green is magenta or red? Or maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, I think I should think in terms of the energy. The dye emits at 2.3393 eV, which is about 531 nm (green). But when a substance emits light, it's because it's dropping from a higher energy state to a lower one. The energy difference is the photon emitted. But the color it absorbs would be the energy it's transitioning to. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this mixed up.

Wait, no. The dye absorbs certain wavelengths and emits others. The energy difference between the excited state and the ground state determines the emitted photon. So if the dye emits at 2.3393 eV (green), that's the energy difference between the two states. The absorbed light would be higher energy? Or lower?

Wait, when a molecule absorbs light, it gets excited to a higher energy state. So the energy of the absorbed photon has to be higher than the energy difference between the ground and excited states. Or wait, no. The energy of the absorbed photon must match the energy gap. Because when the molecule absorbs a photon, it gets excited. So the energy of that photon is the energy of the transition.

Wait, that's a key point. The energy of the emitted photon is the same as the energy of the absorbed photon if it's a simple two-level system. But in reality, molecules have more complex energy levels, so maybe multiple transitions happen.

Wait, but in this question, the dye emits light at 2.3393 eV. That emission is when it drops from an excited state to a lower state. So the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. Therefore, the energy of the absorbed photon when the molecule is initially excited must be higher than that? Or is it the same?

Wait, no. The emission is the energy difference between the two states. So when the molecule absorbs a photon, it goes from ground state to excited state with energy E. Then, when it relaxes, it emits a photon of energy E. So the absorption and emission have the same energy. But wait, that can't be right because if that's the case, the color absorbed and emitted would be the same. But in reality, sometimes substances have more than two energy levels, but in this question, perhaps it's a simple case.

Wait, perhaps the question is implying that the emitted light is at 2.3393 eV, so the wavelength is 531 nm (green). But the absorbed light would be in the complementary color. Wait, no, that's not correct. The absorption spectrum is where the molecule absorbs, which would correspond to the energy difference. So if the molecule emits green light, that's the energy it releases when it relaxes, which suggests that the absorbed light is the same energy—green. But that can't be right because then the dye would be green, but dyes are usually colored based on the complementary color they absorb.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. So let me think again. The color we see is the color that is reflected or transmitted, which is the complementary color of the absorbed. If a dye emits green, that would mean it's absorbing the complementary color of green, which is magenta. But that's not one of the options. The options are red, violet, blue, or yellow.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the absorbed light's color being the same as the emitted? No, that doesn't make sense. Because if the dye emits green, it's reflecting/transmitting green, which means the dye itself must be green. But if a dye is green, it absorbs the complementary, which is magenta, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the energy and the wavelength for absorption. So the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. But the energy of the absorbed photon would be higher if the molecule goes from a lower energy state to a higher one. Wait, but in fluorescence, the emitted photon has lower energy than the absorbed one. Because when the molecule absorbs a higher energy photon, it gets excited, and then when it relaxes, it emits a lower energy photon.

Ah, so that makes sense. So the energy of the emitted photon is lower than the absorbed one. Therefore, the absorbed photon would have higher energy than 2.3393 eV. So what color is higher energy? Violet has higher energy than green.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me outline:

- Energy (eV) of emitted light: 2.3393 eV.
- Emitted wavelength: ~531 nm (green).
- The absorbed photon must have higher energy because the molecule absorbs higher energy to get excited, then emits lower energy when it relaxes.

So the absorbed photon's wavelength is shorter (higher energy) than green. So the absorbed photon would be in the blue or violet range.

Looking at the options, the question is asking what color is absorbed. The options are A) Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow.

So if the emitted is green, the absorbed must be a higher energy color, so either blue or violet.

What's the energy corresponding to blue and violet?

Green: around 530 nm, as above.

Blue is around 450-495 nm. Violet is around 380-450 nm.

Compute energy for blue and violet.

Assuming blue is at 450 nm: E = 1240 eV·nm / 450 nm ≈ 2.756 eV.

Violet at 400 nm: 1240 /400 =3.1 eV.

So the absorbed photon is higher than 2.3393 eV.

The options are violet (3.1 eV) and blue (2.756 eV). So the absorbed light is either blue or violet.

But wait, the question is about the color absorbed. So the dye would have a peak in its absorption spectrum at higher energy than the emission.

So the emitted light is 2.3393 eV (green), so the absorbed light must be higher, let's say 3.1 eV (violet) or 2.75 eV (blue).

So which one is it? The question is about the color absorbed. The options are B) Violet and C) Blue.

If the dye emits green, which is 531 nm, the absorbed light would be at a higher energy (shorter wavelength), which is blue or violet.

So which color is absorbed? The problem is, the question gives the energy of the emitted light, and asks for the absorbed color.

Wait, maybe the question is phrased incorrectly, but perhaps it's implying that the emitted light is the complement of the absorbed. So if the dye emits green, it's absorbing magenta (which is not an option), but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy of the absorbed light is the same as the emitted. Then, the color would be green, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I got it wrong earlier. Wait, when a molecule emits light, that light is the result of a transition between two energy levels. The energy of the emitted photon is the difference between those two levels. So the energy of the absorbed photon must be the same, right? Because absorption and emission are reverse processes. So perhaps the energy of the absorbed and emitted photon is the same. But wait, that would imply the same color, but then that's not matching the options.

Wait, but in the case of fluorescence, the energy of the emitted photon is lower than the absorbed. Because when the molecule is excited, it can lose some energy (e.g., through collisions) before emitting a photon. So the emitted photon is lower in energy than the absorbed.

So in that case, the absorbed photon would be higher in energy than the emitted. So the emitted is 2.3393 eV (green), so the absorbed is higher, say blue or violet.

So in the options, the colors with higher energy than green are violet (3.1 eV) and blue (around 2.75 eV).

So the question is, which color is absorbed, meaning the dye absorbs which color. Since the emitted is green, the absorbed must be higher than green.

So the options are B and C. But which one?

Wait, 2.3393 eV is approximately 531 nm (green). So the absorbed photon must be higher than that, so shorter wavelength. So the absorbed color has higher energy.

So between blue (around 2.75 eV) and violet (3.1 eV), which is higher than 2.3393.

So the absorbed color is either blue or violet.

But the question is, which color is absorbed. So the dye's absorption peak is in the higher energy region.

The question is about the color absorbed. So the dye probably absorbs in the higher energy range, which is blue or violet.

Now, looking at the options, the possible answers are B) Violet and C) Blue.

But how to decide between them.

Wait, let me compute the exact wavelength for 2.3393 eV.

E (eV) = 1240 nm·eV / λ(nm)

So λ = 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ 531 nm, which is green.

So the emitted light is green. Therefore, the dye must absorb light of higher energy (lower wavelength) than green.

So, the absorption is in the blue or violet range.

But what's the exact energy for blue and violet?

Blue is around 450 nm: E = 1240 /450 ≈ 2.756 eV.

Violet is around 400 nm: E=3.1 eV.

So 2.3393 eV is green, the absorbed would be higher.

So the options are B) Violet (3.1 eV) and C) Blue (2.75 eV).

But the question is about the color absorbed. So the dye absorbs either blue or violet.

But how to choose between the two.

Wait, perhaps the answer is violet, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the visible spectrum's color wavelengths.

Wait, the visible spectrum ranges from about 380 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). So blue is around 450-495 nm. So the energy for blue is 2.756 eV, as above.

In this case, 2.3393 eV is lower than blue's energy, so the absorbed photon is higher, meaning bluer (violet or blue).

But in the options, B is violet and C is blue.

The question is about the color absorbed. So the dye that emits green (531 nm) must absorb light of higher energy, so either blue or violet.

But without more data, perhaps the answer expects the absorption to be in the blue region, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: the energy levels. The molecule has an excited state and ground state. The energy difference is 2.3393 eV, which is the emitted photon. So the absorbed photon must have the same energy? Or higher?

Wait, in fluorescence, the molecule absorbs a higher energy photon (for excitation) and emits a lower energy photon. So the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than the emitted.

Therefore, the absorbed photon's energy is higher than 2.3393 eV. So looking at the options, the colors with higher energy than green are violet and blue.

So the absorbed color is either violet or blue.

But how to decide between the two. Since the question is about the color absorbed, perhaps the correct answer is violet, as it has a higher energy than blue.

Wait, the options are A) Red (lower than 2.3393 eV, since red is around 1.8 eV), so not the absorbed. D) Yellow is around 2.0 eV, which is lower than 2.3393, so not the absorbed.

So the options for absorbed are B) Violet and C) Blue.

But which one is correct?

Well, 2.3393 eV is approximately 531 nm (green). The absorbed photon must be higher in energy, so shorter wavelength. The blue light is around 450 nm (E=2.756 eV), which is higher than 2.3393.

Violet is at 400 nm (E=3.1 eV), higher than that.

So the question is, does the dye absorb violet or blue?

Well, without more specific data, perhaps the answer is B) Violet.

Wait, another approach: the question says that the dye has an extensively conjugated pi-electron system. Extensive conjugation usually leads to lower energy gaps, which correspond to longer wavelengths (lower energy) for absorption. Wait, no. Wait, conjugation increases the extent of the pi system, which leads to a lower energy gap between molecular orbitals. Lower energy gap corresponds to longer wavelength (lower energy) absorption. So if the conjugation is extensive, the absorption wavelength would be longer (lower energy) than a less conjugated system.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. The energy gap between molecular orbitals in conjugated systems: more conjugation leads to smaller energy gaps. Because the energy levels are closer together as the molecule becomes more conjugated. So smaller energy gaps correspond to longer wavelengths (lower energy) for absorption.

So a highly conjugated system would absorb lower energy (longer wavelength) light. So the absorption maximum would be in the longer wavelength, lower energy region.

Wait, but wait, the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV (green, 531 nm). If the absorbed photon is higher in energy (shorter wavelength), then a highly conjugated system would have a smaller energy gap, meaning lower energy (longer wavelength) for absorption. Hmm, this is getting confusing.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the molecule's energy levels. When the molecule absorbs a photon, it goes from a lower energy level to a higher one. The energy of the photon must be equal to the energy difference.

If the molecule has a large conjugated system, the energy gap between the ground and excited states is smaller. So the absorbed photon would have lower energy (longer wavelength) than a less conjugated system.

Wait, but in this problem, the emitted light is 2.3393 eV (green). The absorption must be higher, so a smaller conjugated system would have a larger energy gap, requiring higher energy (shorter wavelength) photons for absorption.

But the question states that the dye has an extensively conjugated pi-electrons system. Which would imply a smaller energy gap, so the absorption would be at a lower energy (longer wavelength) than if it were less conjugated.

Wait, but wait: if the molecule has a large conjugated system, the energy gap is smaller. So the energy required for the transition (the absorbed photon's energy) is smaller. But in our case, the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed photon must be higher than that, as per fluorescence.

Hmm this is getting complicated. Let me try to outline:

Emission energy: 2.3393 eV (green, 531 nm).

Absorption energy: higher than 2.3393 eV → shorter wavelength.

But the molecule is extensively conjugated → smaller energy gap → lower energy for transition.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because if the molecule is more conjugated, the energy gap is smaller, so the absorption would be at a lower energy (longer wavelength) than a less conjugated system.

But in our case, the emission is 2.3393 eV, which is green. The absorption must be higher, so a smaller conjugated system would have a larger energy gap, requiring higher energy photons.

Wait, but the question says the molecule has an extensively conjugated system, which would have a smaller energy gap. So the absorption energy would be lower than that of a less conjugated system.

But in our case, the absorption must be higher than emission. So this is conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's go back.

The energy of the emitted photon is the energy difference between the ground state and the excited state. So the absorbed photon must have that same energy, but in fluorescence, the emitted photon is lower in energy than the absorbed, because some energy is lost as heat during the transition.

Wait, in fluorescence, the molecule absorbs a higher energy photon, becomes excited, loses some energy (e.g., through vibrations), and then emits a lower energy photon.

So the energy of the emitted photon (E_emit) is less than the absorbed (E_absorb).

So E_absorb > E_emit.

In our case, E_emit = 2.3393 eV. So E_absorb must be higher than that.

So E_absorb must be in the range higher than 2.3393 eV, which are violet and blue.

So the absorbed photon is either blue or violet.

But the question is, which color is absorbed.

Now, the options are B) Violet and C) Blue.

But without more information, I can't say for sure, but perhaps the question expects the absorption to be in the blue region.

Wait, but 2.3393 eV is green, which is about 530 nm. So the absorbed photon would be higher, so shorter wavelength.

Let me compute the wavelength for 2.3393 eV.

E = 2.3393 eV.

λ = 1240 / E = 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ 531 nm (green).

The absorbed photon's energy must be higher, so λ = 1240 / E.

If E_absorb is higher than 2.3393, the wavelength is shorter than 531 nm.

So for example, if E_absorb is 2.5 eV, λ = 496 nm → blue.

If E_absorb is 3.0 eV, λ=413 nm → violet.

So the absorbed light is either blue or violet.

Now, the question is which of the options is correct.

The options are B) Violet and C) Blue.

But how to decide.

Wait, perhaps the absorption is in the blue region, and the emitted is green. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the conjugated system's absorption is in the visible range. Extensive conjugation usually leads to absorption in the visible region.

Wait, with an extensively conjugated system, the HOMO-LUMO gap is smaller, so the absorption is at longer wavelengths (lower energy). But in our case, the absorption must be higher than the emission (because E_absorb > E_emit).

Wait, this is getting too complicated, but perhaps the answer is Violet.

Wait, if the question gives the emitted as green (531 nm, 2.3393 eV), then the absorbed light would be in the higher energy (shorter wavelength) region. So blue is 450 nm (2.756 eV), violet is 400 nm (3.1 eV).

Which is higher than 2.3393 eV? Both are, but the question is which color is absorbed.

So the correct answer is either B or C.

But looking at the options again:

Options are A) Red (low energy), B) Violet (high energy), C) Blue (medium), D) Yellow (medium).

So the absorbed must be either B or C.

But the energy of emitted is in the middle, green. So the absorbed is higher than that.

Now, I think the correct answer is B) Violet.

Wait, but why?

Wait, think about the color wheel. Green is between blue and yellow. The complementary color of green is magenta, which isn't an option.

But the question is about the absorbed color, not the emitted. So the dye emits green, which means it absorbed the higher energy photon, which could be violet or blue.

But without more information, perhaps the best approach is to find which option falls in higher energy than 2.3393 eV.

B) Violet is 3.1 eV, which is higher.

C) Blue is around 2.756 eV, which is also higher.

So both options B and C have higher energy than emitted.

But the question is, which is the color absorbed.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the complementary color.

Wait, the color we see is the color that's not absorbed. So if a dye emits green, it reflects/transmits green. Therefore, it absorbs the complementary color, which is magenta. But magenta isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the other way around: the emitted color is the color that's transmitted, and the absorbed is the other. So if the dye emits green, it must have absorbed the other colors. But that's not how it works. The color we see is the color that's not absorbed.

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me think differently.

Dyes absorb certain wavelengths and transmit the complementary. So if a dye appears green, it must be absorbing the complementary color, which is magenta. But again, that's not an option.

But wait, the question is about the color absorbed, not the color of the dye. The emitted light is 2.3393 eV (green), so the dye emits green. But the absorbed light must be higher energy.

So the absorbed color is either blue or violet.

But without knowing the exact energy, perhaps the answer is violet, as it's the higher energy.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the color absorbed to be the same as the emitted. But that's not the case.

Wait, another approach: the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, so the color it emits is green. The question is what color is absorbed.

But the question is a bit tricky because when a molecule emits a photon, it's because it's losing energy. So the emitted photon's energy is the energy difference between the two states. So the absorbed photon's energy must be higher than that, as the molecule must gain energy to reach the excited state.

So in this case, the absorbed photon must have higher energy than 2.3393 eV.

Looking at the options, B is violet (3.1 eV), which is higher. C is blue (2.75 eV), which is also higher.

So which option is correct?

Wait, perhaps the answer is B) Violet.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the absorption is in the blue region, so the answer is C) Blue.

Hmm, I think I'm overcomplicating this. The key point is that the absorbed photon has higher energy than the emitted.

In the options, both B and C are higher.

So perhaps the intended answer is B) Violet, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the energy levels. The molecule in an excited state emits a photon of energy E_emit. So the energy gap between the ground and excited state is E_emit.

When the molecule absorbs a photon of energy E_absorb, which must be equal to E_emit plus any energy lost, but in reality, E_absorb is the same as E_emit? Or higher?

Wait, no, because in fluorescence, the molecule must absorb a photon higher in energy than the emitted. Because the molecule loses some energy between absorption and emission.

So, E_absorb must be higher than E_emit.

So, in this case, E_absorb must be higher than 2.3393 eV.

So, the only options are B (Violet) and C (Blue), which are higher.

But which one?

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is blue.

Wait, another thought: the emission energy is 2.3393 eV, which is green. The absorbed energy is higher, so it's in the blue or violet. But without knowing the exact value, perhaps the question expects blue as the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the emitted photon is the same as the absorbed, but that doesn't make sense because then the dye would be green, but the question is about absorption.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is reversed. Let me read the question again.

Question: A textile dye containing an extensively conjugated pi-electrons emits light with energy of 2.3393 eV. What color of light is absorbed by the organic compound?

So the dye emits green (2.3393 eV). It must absorb a higher energy photon (blue or violet).

So the correct answer is either B) Violet or C) Blue.

But how to choose.

Wait, another thought: the energy of 2.3393 eV is 531 nm (green). The absorbed energy would be higher, so the color would be either blue (450 nm, 2.756 eV) or violet (400 nm, 3.1 eV).

Now, the question is to pick between these two.

But without more data, perhaps the intended answer is blue.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is blue because the question says the molecule is extensively conjugated. Extensive conjugation leads to lower energy (longer wavelength) absorption. But wait, the absorption must be higher than the emission energy.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. If the molecule is extensively conjugated, the absorption is at a longer wavelength (lower energy), but in this case, the absorption must be shorter wavelength (higher energy) than green.

So if the molecule is more conjugated, the absorption band would be at a longer wavelength. But in this case, the absorption must be shorter than green.

Hmm, this seems conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the complementary color.

Wait, the dye emits green; therefore, it must absorb magenta. But magenta isn't an option. So perhaps the reasoning is incorrect.

Alternatively, the question is asking about the color absorbed, which is the same as the color of the emitted photon?

No, that can't be right because the dye would then be transparent, which isn't the case.

Wait, perhaps I should just conclude that the answer is B) Violet.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, maybe it's blue.

Wait, the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV. Let's see the position of this in the visible spectrum.

2.3393 eV → 531 nm → green.

Absorption must be higher energy, so blue (450 nm) is higher than green, and violet (400 nm) is even higher.

So blue is 2.756 eV, which is higher than 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed photon could be blue or violet.

But which is more likely? The question doesn't provide more info, so perhaps I should pick the higher energy option, which is violet.

Therefore, the correct answer would be B) Violet.


To determine the color of light absorbed by the textile dye, we start by analyzing the energy of the emitted light. The dye emits light with an energy of **2.3393 eV**, which corresponds to a wavelength of approximately **531 nm** (green light). The energy of light is inversely related to its wavelength, as described by the equation:

\[
E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]

where \(E\) is the energy, \(h\) is Planck's constant, \(c\) is the speed of light, and \(\lambda\) is the wavelength. A higher energy corresponds to a shorter wavelength, while a lower energy corresponds to a longer wavelength.

In fluorescence, the energy of the emitted photon is typically lower than the energy of the absorbed photon because the molecule loses some energy (e.g., as heat) during the transition from the excited state to the ground state. Therefore, the absorbed photon must have higher energy than the emitted photon.

The energy of the emitted photon is **2.3393 eV**, so the absorbed photon must have an energy greater than this value. The visible spectrum ranges from violet (380 nm, 3.1 eV) to red (700 nm, 1.8 eV). Among the options provided:

- **A) Red**: 1.8 eV (lower than 2.3393 eV, not possible for absorption).
- **B) Violet**: 3.1 eV (higher than 2.3393 eV, possible for absorption).
- **C) Blue**: 2.756 eV (higher than 2.3393 eV, possible for absorption).
- **D) Yellow**: 2.0 eV (lower than 2.3393 eV, not possible for absorption).

Both violet (3.1 eV) and blue (2.756 eV) have higher energy than the emitted photon (2.3393 eV). However, the question does not provide additional details about the specific energy gap of the dye or its conjugation effects. Extensive conjugation typically reduces the energy gap, leading to absorption at longer wavelengths (lower energy), but the absorption must still be higher than the emitted energy in this case.

Given the options, the most reasonable conclusion is that the absorbed light is **violet**, as it represents the higher energy option. 

**Answer: B**
