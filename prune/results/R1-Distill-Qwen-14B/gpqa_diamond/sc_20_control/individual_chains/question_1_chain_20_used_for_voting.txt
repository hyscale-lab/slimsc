Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to think it through. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2, each having different lifetimes. The goal is to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish between them.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle here. Oh right, the energy-time uncertainty principle. The formula is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So the uncertainty in energy depends on the time the state exists.

The lifetimes given are 1e-9 seconds for the first state and 1e-8 seconds for the second. Wait, no, actually, the problem says they have energies E1 and E2 and lifetimes 1e-9 and 1e-8 seconds respectively. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused. Does the lifetime correspond to each state individually, or is it the time over which we're measuring? Because I think the uncertainty principle applies to each state's lifetime. So each state has its own Δt.

But the question is about distinguishing the two energy levels. So perhaps we need to find the minimum detectable energy difference between E1 and E2. Because if the energy difference is too small, the uncertainty might make it hard to tell them apart.

So the energy difference ΔE between E1 and E2 needs to be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, the signals might overlap, making it impossible to distinguish them.

Wait, but each state has its own uncertainty. For the first state, lifetime τ1 is 1e-9 sec. So the uncertainty ΔE1 is about ħ/(2τ1). Similarly, ΔE2 is ħ/(2τ2).

But wait, the problem is not about the uncertainty of each state, but about the energy difference between them. So to resolve two states, the energy difference ΔE should be greater than the sum of their uncertainties? Or maybe each of their individual uncertainties?

Alternatively, perhaps the combined uncertainty is the minimum of the two. I'm a bit fuzzy on this.

Let me think again. The lifetime τ is the time for which the state is observed. The uncertainty in energy for each state would be ħ/(2τ). So for the first state, ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2τ1), which would be for τ1=1e-9 s.

And for the second, ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(2τ2) with τ2=1e-8 s.

But since we're looking at the energy difference between E1 and E2, which is ΔE = E2 - E1. To distinguish them, this ΔE should be larger than either of their individual uncertainties. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty of either state, perhaps you can't tell them apart.

Wait, maybe the condition is that the energy difference ΔE must be larger than the uncertainty in energy. Otherwise, the two states' energy levels would overlap in the uncertainty, making it impossible to resolve.

So the minimal detectable ΔE is perhaps the sum of the uncertainties, or the maximum of the two. Or maybe the minimum?

Wait, let me think in terms of the uncertainty principle. The energy resolution required is determined by the precision with which you can measure the energy. If the system's lifetime is short, the uncertainty in energy is larger. So for each state, the uncertainty is higher for the shorter lifetime.

So if E1 has a lifetime of 1e-9 s, its ΔE is larger than that of E2, which has a longer lifetime. Because a longer τ gives a smaller ΔE.

Wait, wait. Let me calculate the order of magnitude. Let's compute the uncertainties.

The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So for τ1=1e-9 s:

ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2τ1) = (1.05457e-34) / (2 * 1e-9) ≈ (1.05e-34)/(2e-9) = ~5.25e-26 J.

But wait, we need this in eV. I remember that 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J.

So 5.25e-26 J is (5.25e-26 J) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ (5.25 / 1.602) * 1e-7 eV ≈ 3.28e-7 eV. So approximately 3.28e-7 eV.

Similarly for τ2=1e-8 s:

ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(2τ2) = (1.05e-34)/(2e-8) = ~5.25e-27 J. Convert to eV: 5.25e-27 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.28e-8 eV.

So ΔE1 is about 3.28e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is about 3.28e-8 eV.

But wait, the energy difference between the two states should be larger than the sum of their uncertainties? Or just larger than the larger uncertainty, because the larger uncertainty is the dominant one.

Wait, let's think: if you have two states with energy uncertainties ΔE1 and ΔE2, what's the minimum ΔE required for them to be distinguishable? I think it should be greater than the maximum of the two uncertainties. Because, for instance, if one state has a much larger uncertainty, then the minimal detectable ΔE is determined by the larger uncertainty.

In this case, ΔE1 is 3.28e-7 eV, which is larger than ΔE2's 3.28e-8 eV. So the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be at least larger than ΔE1, which is 3.28e-7 eV, to be distinguishable.

Looking at the options:

Options are:
A) 1e-9 eV → 1e-9 eV is much smaller than 3.28e-7. So no, can't distinguish.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, in the problem statement, perhaps the two states have energies E1 and E2, and their lifetimes are given as 1e-9 and 1e-8. But wait, the problem says "the lifetime of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, respectively." So E1 has τ1=1e-9, E2 has τ2=1e-8.

Wait, but in the uncertainty principle, each state's energy uncertainty is ΔE1 and ΔE2. So when you have two energy levels, the energy difference between them is ΔE = E2 - E1.

To resolve them, ΔE should be at least the sum of the two uncertainties, or perhaps the maximum. Or maybe the minimum.

Alternatively, perhaps each state's energy uncertainty is determined by their own lifetime. So the minimal detectable ΔE would be the sum of the two uncertainties because the combined effect could lead to a larger uncertainty in the measured energy difference. Or, I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach. If the system is in a state that is a superposition of E1 and E2, then the uncertainty in energy would be related to the interference between them. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, the energy resolution is determined by the time over which the energy is measured. But perhaps the question is assuming that both states are being observed, and the time resolution is the same? Or maybe each has their own.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Because if the energy difference is smaller than either uncertainty, you can't resolve them.

Wait, let's think about it more carefully. The uncertainty principle says that the product of the uncertainty in energy and the uncertainty in time must be at least ħ/2.

So for E1, the uncertainty ΔE1 is ħ/(2τ1).

For E2, it's ΔE2 = ħ/(2τ2).

If these two states are being mixed, what is the energy resolution needed?

Wait, perhaps we can think about the energy resolution as being the least energy difference that can be detected. So to resolve two states, the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in the system's energy. So if the system's energy is measured, the precision is limited by the uncertainty.

But in this case, the problem is about two separate states with their own lifetimes. So perhaps the energy difference has to be larger than the maximum of the individual uncertainties.

Wait, the first state has a larger uncertainty in energy (ΔE1 ≈ 3.28e-7 eV), the second has a lower uncertainty (≈3.28e-8 eV). So the maximum uncertainty is ΔE1.

So the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than 3.28e-7 eV. But looking at the options, none of the options are that large. The largest option is C: 1e-4 eV, which is larger. So maybe that's the right choice.

Wait, but let's compute the exact numbers.

Compute ΔE1:

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s

τ1 = 1e-9 s

ΔE1 = ħ/(2 τ1) = 1.0545718e-34/(2 * 1e-9) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-9) = 5.272859e-26 J.

Convert to eV: 5.272859e-26 J / 1.602176634e-19 J/eV ≈ 3.29e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = ħ/(2 * 1e-8 s) = 1.05457e-34/(2e-8) = 5.2728e-27 J. That's about 3.29e-8 eV.

So the maximum uncertainty is 3.29e-7 eV. So the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than this for them to be distinguishable. Looking at the options:

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV. That's bigger than 3.29e-7 eV (which is 0.000000329 eV), so it's about 300 times larger.

So option C is 1e-4 eV, which is larger than the maximum uncertainty. So that would allow the two states to be distinguished.

Looking at the other options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.000000001 eV → smaller than 3.29e-7, not sufficient.

B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller, not enough.

C) 1e-4 eV → sufficient.

D) 1e-8 eV → 0.00000001 eV → smaller than 3.29e-7, so not enough.

So the correct answer should be option C.

To distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), their energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state. The energy-time uncertainty principle states:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state, and \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant (\( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)).

### Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainties
For the first state with lifetime \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \tau_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
\]
Convert to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602176634 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
\[
\Delta E_1 \approx \frac{5.27 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602176634 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

For the second state with lifetime \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \tau_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}.
\]
Convert to electron volts:
\[
\Delta E_2 \approx \frac{5.27 \times 10^{-27}}{1.602176634 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Determine the minimum energy difference
To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) must be greater than the larger of the two uncertainties. Here, \( \Delta E_1 = 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \) is larger than \( \Delta E_2 = 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \). Therefore, \( \Delta E \) must be greater than \( 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).

### Step 3: Analyze the options
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is smaller than \( 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient to distinguish the two states.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is also smaller than \( 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is larger than \( 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is sufficient to distinguish the two states.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is smaller than \( 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

### Conclusion
The correct answer is **Option C**, as \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) is large enough to ensure the two energy levels can be clearly resolved.

Wait, but each state has its own uncertainty. For the first state, lifetime τ1 is 1e-9 sec. So the uncertainty ΔE1 is about ħ/(2τ1). Similarly, ΔE2 is ħ/(2τ2).

But wait, the problem is not about the uncertainty of each state, but about the energy difference between them. So to resolve two states, the energy difference ΔE should be greater than the sum of their uncertainties? Or maybe each of their individual uncertainties?

Let me think again. The lifetime τ is the time for which the state is observed. The uncertainty in energy for each state would be ħ/(2τ). So for the first state, ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2τ1), which would be for τ1=1e-9 s.

And for the second, ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(2τ2) with τ2=1e-8 s.

But since we're looking at the energy difference between E1 and E2, which is ΔE = E2 - E1. To distinguish them, this ΔE should be larger than either of their individual uncertainties.

So if E1 has a lifetime of 1e-9 s, its ΔE is larger than that of E2, which has a longer lifetime. Because a longer τ gives a smaller ΔE.

Wait, wait. Let me calculate the order of magnitude. Let's compute the uncertainties.

The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So for τ1=1e-9 s:

ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2τ1) = (1.05457e-34) / (2 * 1e-9) ≈ (1.05e-34)/(2e-9) = ~5.25e-26 J.

But wait, we need this in eV. I remember that 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J.

So 5.25e-26 J is (5.25e-26 J) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ (5.25 / 1.602) * 1e-7 eV ≈ 3.28e-7 eV. So approximately 3.28e-7 eV.

Similarly for τ2=1e-8 s:

ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(2τ2) = (1.05e-34)/(2e-8) = ~5.25e-27 J. Convert to eV: 5.25e-27 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.28e-8 eV.

So ΔE1 is about 3.28e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is about 3.28e-8 eV.

But wait, the energy difference between the two states should be larger than the sum of their uncertainties? Or just larger than the larger uncertainty, because the larger uncertainty is the dominant one.

Wait, let's think: if you have two states with energy uncertainties ΔE1 and ΔE2, what's the minimum ΔE required for them to be distinguishable?

Because, for instance, if one state has a much larger uncertainty, then the minimal detectable ΔE is determined by the larger uncertainty.

Looking at the options:

Options are:
A) 1e-9 eV → 1e-9 eV is much smaller than 3.28e-7. So no, can't distinguish.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, in the problem statement, perhaps the two states have energies E1 and E2, and their lifetimes are given as 1e-9 and 1e-8. But wait, the problem says "the lifetime of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, respectively." So E1 has τ1=1e-9, E2 has τ2=1e-8.

Wait, but in the uncertainty principle, each state's energy uncertainty is ΔE1 and ΔE2. So when you have two energy levels, the energy difference between them is ΔE = E2 - E1.

Wait, but let's compute the exact numbers.

Compute ΔE1:

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s

τ1 = 1e-9 s

ΔE1 = ħ/(2 τ1) = 1.0545718e-34/(2 * 1e-9) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-9) = 5.272859e-26 J.

Convert to eV: 5.272859e-26 J / 1.602176634e-19 J/eV ≈ 3.29e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = ħ/(2 * 1e-8 s) = 1.05457e-34/(2e-8) = 5.2728e-27 J. That's about 3.29e-8 eV.

So the maximum uncertainty is 3.29e-7 eV. So the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than this for them to be distinguishable. Looking at the options:

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV. That's bigger than 3.29e-7 eV (which is 0.000000329 eV), so it's about 300 times larger.

So option C is 1e-4 eV, which is larger than the maximum uncertainty. So that would allow the two states to be distinguished.

Looking at the other options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.000000001 eV → smaller than 3.29e-7, not sufficient.

B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller, not enough.

C) 1e-4 eV → sufficient.

D) 1e-8 eV → 0.00000001 eV → smaller than 3.29e-7, so not enough.

So the correct answer should be option C.


To distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), their energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state. The energy-time uncertainty principle states:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state, and \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant (\( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)).

### Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainties
For the first state with lifetime \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \tau_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
\]
Convert to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602176634 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
\[
\Delta E_1 \approx \frac{5.27 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602176634 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

For the second state with lifetime \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \tau_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}.
\]
Convert to electron volts:
\[
\Delta E_2 \approx \frac{5.27 \times 10^{-27}}{1.602176634 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Determine the minimum energy difference
To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) must be greater than the larger of the two uncertainties. Here, \( \Delta E_1 = 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \) is larger than \( \Delta E_2 = 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \). Therefore, \( \Delta E \) must be greater than \( 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).

### Step 3: Analyze the options
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is smaller than \( 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient to distinguish the two states.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is also smaller than \( 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is larger than \( 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is sufficient to distinguish the two states.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is smaller than \( 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

### Conclusion
The correct answer is **Option C**, as \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) is large enough to ensure the two energy levels can be clearly resolved.

Answer: C
