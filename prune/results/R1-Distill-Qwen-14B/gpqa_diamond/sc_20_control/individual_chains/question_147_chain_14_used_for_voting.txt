Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think. The question is about the annihilation process where a proton and an antiproton collide to produce two particles, A+ and A-. The given equation is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. 

Wait, no, wait. The equation says 2A⁺ and 2A⁻. So that's four particles in total. But I don't know if that's important right now.

The problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly. Oh, wait, no, it says the antiproton is "slowly moving." So the speed is much less than the speed of light? Or maybe not? Well, the problem gives m_A c² as 300 MeV. So each A particle has a rest mass of 300 MeV/c².

I need to find the velocity of particle A. Hmm. So this is a conservation of energy and momentum problem, I think. Because in high-energy physics, when particles collide, their energy and momentum are conserved.

Wait, but the antiproton is moving slowly. So maybe we can approximate it as being at rest? Because if it's moving slowly, its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. Or perhaps not. Wait, but the problem doesn't say the proton is moving; it says the antiproton is slow. So maybe the proton is initially at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly. Or perhaps the center of mass frame is considered. Hmm.

Wait, let me re-read the question. The problem says, "the antiproton is slowly moving." So the initial system is a proton and an antiproton. The proton might be at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly. So in the lab frame, perhaps the proton is at rest, and the antiproton has some low speed.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the center of mass frame. Because in particle physics, annihilation reactions are often considered in the center of mass frame where things are symmetric.

But let's not get ahead of myself. Let's think about conservation of energy and momentum.

In the initial state, there's a proton and an antiproton. The proton has rest mass m_p, and the antiproton has the same rest mass m_p. So m_p c² is about 938 MeV, I remember that. But wait, the problem states m_A c² is 300 MeV, so each A has a rest mass of 300 MeV/c². So A particles are lighter than protons.

In the reaction, two A+ and two A- are produced. So four particles in total.

Now, the initial momentum: the proton is at rest, so its momentum is zero. The antiproton is moving slowly, so its momentum is maybe non-zero but low compared to its rest mass. Since its velocity is small, maybe we can approximate it as being at rest. Or perhaps not, because even a small velocity could contribute when multiplied by c.

Wait, but if the antiproton is moving, then the initial momentum isn't zero. So energy and momentum must be conserved, and this might complicate things. Alternatively, if the antiproton is moving very slowly (v << c), then the kinetic energy is much smaller than the rest mass energy. So maybe we can treat the antiproton as approximately at rest, and then the problem would be in the center of mass frame where the proton and antiproton are moving towards each other but with equal and opposite momenta, thus their momentum sums to zero.

Wait, but the problem states that the antiproton is "slowly moving." So perhaps the initial system's momentum is not zero. Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the setup is that the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with a slow speed. So in the lab frame, the initial momentum is just that of the antiproton. After the collision, the products are the four A particles. Since the A particles are produced symmetrically, perhaps their momenta are arranged in such a way that their total momentum is the same as the initial momentum.

Alternatively, maybe because the initial system's momentum is small (since the antiproton is moving slowly), the A particles are moving in such a way that their average speed is determined by the available energy.

Wait, but I'm supposed to find the velocity of each A. Hmm. Maybe in the center of mass frame, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the conservation of energy and momentum in the lab frame (where the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly). So in this frame, the initial momentum is just that of the antiproton. Let's denote its velocity as v_p. Since it's moving slowly, v_p << c, so maybe we can approximate its momentum as (gamma) m_p v_p. But since v_p is small, gamma is approximately 1 + (v_p^2)/(2c^2), which is close to 1.

But perhaps I can proceed by assuming that the initial momentum is small compared to the rest energy. Wait, but the problem is about finding the velocity of the A particles. So perhaps the A particles are all moving with the same velocity, which would make the math easier.

Wait, if the A particles are moving in some symmetric fashion, maybe their momenta add up to the same as the initial momentum. For example, if two A+ and two A- are produced, and they are in opposite directions, perhaps each pair of A has some momentum that cancels out, except for a net momentum equal to the initial antiproton's momentum.

But this is getting a bit vague. Maybe an alternative approach is to consider that in the center of mass frame, the initial momentum is zero, and the A particles are emitted symmetrically, leading to them being at rest. But that can't be right because the rest mass of the products would need to match the total energy in the center of mass.

Wait, but the initial rest mass is m_p + m_p (proton and antiproton), so 2 * 938 MeV = 1876 MeV. The products are four A particles, each with 300 MeV rest mass, so total rest mass is 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV. So the total rest mass of the products is much less than the initial rest mass. That suggests that the products have a lot of kinetic energy, so they must be moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light.

Wait, but in the center of mass frame, the initial energy is 2 m_p c². So 1876 MeV. The rest mass of the products is 4 * 300 MeV = 1200 MeV. So the available energy is much higher, so the A particles will be moving at high speeds.

But wait, the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly. So perhaps this is a lab frame where the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with a low speed. Then the initial energy is the sum of the proton's rest energy and the antiproton's total energy, which includes its kinetic energy. But because the antiproton is moving slowly, its kinetic energy is much smaller than its rest energy. So maybe we can approximate the initial energy as just 2 m_p c², similar to the center of mass frame.

Wait, but if the antiproton is moving, then the total energy would be E_p (proton) + E_anti_p. Since the proton is at rest, E_p = m_p c². The antiproton's energy is gamma m_p c², with gamma being approximately 1 because v is small. So the total energy is approximately 2 m_p c², same as the center of mass. So perhaps the initial energy is roughly 2 m_p c², and the rest mass of the products is 1200 MeV, so the kinetic energy available is 1876 - 1200 = 676 MeV.

But that's if the antiproton is moving at non-relativistic speeds, but perhaps the problem requires a relativistic approach.

Wait, but I'm supposed to find the velocity of each A. Let's think about the conservation of energy and momentum.

In the lab frame (proton at rest, antiproton moving slowly), the initial momentum is that of the antiproton: p_initial = gamma m_p v_p, where v_p is the velocity of the antiproton. Since v_p is small, gamma is approximately 1, so p_initial ≈ m_p v_p.

After the collision, the four A particles are produced. Assuming they are all moving with the same velocity v, but probably not—that's probably an oversimplification. But perhaps they're moving in such a way that their momenta add up to p_initial. For instance, maybe two are moving in one direction and two in another, but their combined momentum equals p_initial. Hmm, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps all four A particles are moving in the same direction as the initial antiproton, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, they might be moving symmetrically, such that some of their momenta cancel out.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to think in terms of the center of mass frame. Since the initial momentum is p_initial, which is not zero, the center of mass frame is moving at some velocity relative to the lab frame. But this is getting a bit too involved.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to consider that in the center of mass frame, the initial momentum is zero. So the products must have zero net momentum. So the four A particles must be emitted in such a way that their momenta cancel out. But since they're identical particles, perhaps they move in opposite directions in pairs. But then how does that translate to their velocity?

Wait, let's think in terms of energy and momentum in the center of mass frame. The initial energy is 2 m_p c². The rest mass energy of the products is 4 m_A c², which is 1200 MeV. So the total energy in the center of mass frame is 1876 MeV, and the rest energy is 1200 MeV. So the kinetic energy available is 676 MeV.

But wait, in the center of mass frame, the total momentum is zero, so the products (four A particles) must have zero net momentum. Thus, their momenta must cancel each other out. So each A must have equal and opposite momentum to another A. So perhaps two pairs are moving in opposite directions, each pair with momentum p and -p, so that the total is zero.

But how does that help me find the velocity of each A? Maybe each A has the same speed but opposite directions. So each pair could be moving in opposite directions, leading to zero net momentum.

But the problem is to find the velocity of each A. Now, since all A particles are identical, perhaps they all have the same speed but different directions, but that's probably too much to assume.

Alternatively, maybe each A has the same speed and direction. No, that can't be because then their momenta would add up, leading to a net momentum in the center of mass frame. Which would have to be zero.

So, the only way to have zero net momentum is if the momenta of the A particles sum to zero. So perhaps each A has the same speed but opposite directions.

Wait, but that might not be the case if they are emitted in different directions, but perhaps the problem assumes they are all moving in the same direction, but that doesn't make sense because in the center of mass frame, they must have momentum that cancels.

Hmm. Maybe this is getting too complicated. Another approach: the energy and momentum of each A can be calculated, and then the total must match the initial.

Wait, perhaps the problem is symmetric. So each A has the same speed, but their momenta are arranged symmetrically. Maybe all four are moving in the same direction but with their momenta adding up to the initial momentum. Wait, that doesn't make sense because in the lab frame, the initial momentum is just that of the antiproton. So the sum of the A's momenta should equal the initial momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps each A has the same momentum. Wait, but that would mean their directions are such that the total momentum is the same as the initial. But that's unclear.

Alternatively, maybe each A is moving in the opposite direction, but that doesn't help because I'm not sure how their velocities would add up. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the key is to consider that in the lab frame, the initial system has a certain energy and momentum, and the products must have the same. But to find the velocity of each A, perhaps the kinetic energy can be found, and from that, the velocity can be determined using relativistic equations.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be approximated by assuming that the A particles are moving at a high speed, so their kinetic energy is much larger than their rest mass energy. Wait, no, because m_A is 300 MeV, and the available energy is 676 MeV. So the kinetic energy per A would be about 169 MeV. Hmm, but that's not negligible compared to 300 MeV, so the gamma factor might be something like 300 + 169 = 469 MeV, which is about 1.56 times the rest mass. So gamma would be about 1.56, leading to a velocity around 0.8c or something like that.

Wait, but how to proceed with the exact calculation.

In the lab frame, let's denote:

Proton is at rest: energy E_p = m_p c².

Antiproton has velocity v, so its energy is gamma m_p c², and its momentum is gamma m_p v.

The initial total energy is E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c².

The initial momentum is p_initial = gamma m_p v.

After collision, four A particles are produced. Let's denote the velocity of each A as u. Assuming each A has the same speed u. But wait, that's probably not correct because in the lab frame, the products can't all have the same velocity unless their momenta add up to the initial momentum. But perhaps for simplicity, the problem assumes that all A particles are moving in the same direction, each with velocity u, so their momenta add up to 4 gamma_A m_A u, where gamma_A is the Lorentz factor for u.

Wait, but that would make the total momentum 4 gamma_A m_A u. That must equal the initial momentum p_initial = gamma m_p v.

But I'm not sure if that's a correct assumption. Alternatively, perhaps each A's velocity is such that their momentum vectors sum up to the initial momentum.

But let's proceed with this assumption for a moment, and see where it leads.

So, energy conservation: E_initial = sum of energies of the A particles.

E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c².

But wait, the rest mass of the proton is m_p, and the antiproton is m_p. So E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c².

The sum of the energies of the A particles would be 4 gamma_A m_A c².

Wait, because each A has energy gamma_A m_A c², and there are four of them.

So energy conservation:

m_p c² + gamma m_p c² = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

Similarly, momentum conservation:

gamma m_p v = 4 gamma_A m_A u.

Now, variables are gamma (which depends on v), and gamma_A (which depends on u).

But I have two equations with two variables: gamma and gamma_A. Hmm, but that's complicated because both gamma and gamma_A are functions of different variables.

Wait, but the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly, so v is much less than c. So gamma ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2c²), which is approximately 1. So perhaps we can approximate gamma ≈ 1. So then:

E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c² = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

So gamma_A = (2 m_p c²) / (4 m_A c²) ) = (m_p)/(2 m_A).

Given that m_p is about 938 MeV/c², and m_A is 300 MeV/c².

So gamma_A = 938 / (2 * 300) = 938 / 600 ≈ 1.563.

So gamma_A is about 1.563.

Gamma is defined as 1 / sqrt(1 - u²/c²) = 1.563.

So solving for u:

1/1.563 ≈ sqrt(1 - (u²/c²)).

0.64 ≈ sqrt(1 - (u²/c²)).

Squaring both sides: 0.4096 ≈ 1 - u²/c².

So u²/c² ≈ 1 - 0.4096 = 0.5904.

u ≈ c * sqrt(0.5904) ≈ c * 0.768.

So approximately 0.77c.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.77c.

But wait, this is under the assumption that the antiproton is moving very slowly, so gamma ≈ 1, and that all four A particles are moving in the same direction with the same speed. But that might not be accurate.

Wait, but in reality, the A particles would have a distribution of velocities, but perhaps the problem is assuming they all share the same velocity. Alternatively, maybe the initial assumption is correct, and the answer is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the exact calculation without the approximation. Let's try that.

We have:

From energy conservation:

m_p c² + gamma m_p c² = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

From momentum conservation:

gamma m_p v = 4 gamma_A m_A u.

We can express gamma as (1 - beta²)^(-1/2), where beta = v/c.

But this seems complicated. Let me consider substituting variables.

Let me denote beta = v/c.

So, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²).

Similarly, gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - u²/c²}.

Let me write the energy equation:

(m_p + gamma m_p) = 4 gamma_A m_A.

So,

gamma = [4 gamma_A m_A / m_p] - 1.

Similarly, from the momentum equation:

gamma m_p beta = 4 gamma_A m_A u.

Substituting gamma from the energy equation:

[ (4 gamma_A m_A / m_p ) - 1 ) ] * m_p beta = 4 gamma_A m_A u.

Simplify:

(4 gamma_A m_A - m_p) beta = 4 gamma_A m_A u.

Hmm, but this is getting complicated. Let's plug in the numbers.

m_p = 938 MeV/c².

m_A = 300 MeV/c².

So,

(4 gamma_A *300 - 938) * beta = 4 gamma_A *300 u.

But I'm not sure how to proceed further. Maybe another approach is needed.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find beta_A (u/c) using the energy and momentum.

Let me denote beta_A = u/c.

Then gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta_A^2).

We have two equations:

m_p c² + gamma m_p c^2 = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

gamma m_p v = 4 gamma_A m_A u.

Let me divide the momentum equation by the energy equation to eliminate gamma.

[gamma m_p v ] / [ m_p c² (1 + gamma) ) ] = [4 gamma_A m_A u ] / [4 gamma_A m_A c²} ].

Simplify:

[gamma v ] / [c² (1 + gamma) ) ] = u / c².

Multiply both sides by c²:

gamma v / (1 + gamma) ) = u.

Hmm, but not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps I can find another relation.

Wait, from the energy equation:

gamma = (4 gamma_A m_A - m_p) / m_p.

Wait, no, let me rearrange the energy equation:

gamma m_p c² = 4 gamma_A m_A c² - m_p c².

So,

gamma = [4 gamma_A m_A - m_p ] / m_p.

But then substituting into the momentum equation:

gamma m_p v = 4 gamma_A m_A u.

Replace gamma:

[ (4 gamma_A m_A - m_p ) / m_p ] * m_p v = 4 gamma_A m_A u.

Simplify:

(4 gamma_A m_A - m_p ) v = 4 gamma_A m_A u.

So,

u = [ (4 gamma_A m_A - m_p ) v ] / (4 gamma_A m_A )

Hmm, but we still have multiple variables.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approximation is good enough, and the answer is 0.77c, which is option A.

But let me think again. The initial assumption was that the antiproton is moving very slowly, so v ≈ 0, so gamma ≈ 1. Then the energy equation becomes 2 m_p c² = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

gamma_A = (2 m_p) / (4 m_A ) = m_p/(2 m_A ) = 938/(2*300) ≈ 1.563.

Which gives beta_A ≈ sqrt(1 - (1/gamma_A)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (1/(1.563)^2 )).

1.563 squared is approximately 2.442.

1/2.442 ≈ 0.4096.

So 1 - 0.4096 = 0.5904.

sqrt(0.5904) ≈ 0.768, so 0.768 c.

Which is approximately 0.77c, option A.

But I'm a bit concerned because the problem states that the antiproton is moving, not that it's at rest. So perhaps the approximation isn't valid, and the actual velocity of A is higher.

Wait, let me think again. If the antiproton is moving, then the initial energy is higher than 2 m_p c². Wait, no, because the proton is at rest, and the antiproton's energy is gamma m_p c².

So, the initial energy is E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c².

Which is higher than 2 m_p c².

So, the available energy is more, which would mean that the A particles have higher energy, so higher gamma, so higher velocity.

Wait, but in my initial approximation, I assumed gamma=1, which led to a velocity of about 0.77c. But if the antiproton is moving, gamma>1, so the available energy is higher. So the A particles would have higher energy, leading to higher velocity.

So perhaps my initial approximation underestimated the velocity.

Hmm, but the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, so v is small, so gamma is close to 1. So the initial energy is approximately 2 m_p c².

But perhaps the exact calculation would give a higher velocity. Let's try to compute more accurately.

So, in the exact case, gamma is larger than 1. But since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe gamma is just a bit larger than 1. Let me consider a small beta for the antiproton.

Let me denote beta = v/c, and it's small.

So gamma ≈ 1 + (beta²)/2.

So, the energy equation:

(m_p c²) + gamma m_p c² = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

Substituting gamma ≈ 1 + beta²/2,

m_p c² (1 + 1 + beta²/2 ) = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

So,

2 m_p c² (1 + beta²/4 ) = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

Divide both sides by 2 c²:

m_p (1 + beta²/4 ) = 2 gamma_A m_A.

So,

gamma_A = [ m_p (1 + beta²/4 ) ] / (2 m_A )

= [ 938 * (1 + beta²/4 ) ] / (600 )

= (938 / 600 ) * (1 + beta²/4 )

≈ 1.563333... * (1 + beta²/4 ).

So,

gamma_A = 1.563333 (1 + beta²/4 )

Similarly, from the momentum equation:

gamma m_p beta = 4 gamma_A m_A u.

Substituting gamma ≈ 1 + beta²/2,

(1 + beta²/2 ) m_p beta = 4 gamma_A m_A u.

Substituting gamma_A from earlier,

(1 + beta²/2 ) m_p beta = 4 * [1.563333 (1 + beta²/4 ) ] m_A u.

Divide both sides by m_A:

(1 + beta²/2 ) m_p beta / m_A = 4 * 1.563333 (1 + beta²/4 ) u.

Plugging in m_p = 938, m_A = 300,

(1 + beta²/2 ) * (938/300) * beta = 4 * 1.563333 * (1 + beta²/4 ) u.

Calculate 938/300 ≈ 3.1267.

4 * 1.563333 ≈ 6.25333.

So,

(1 + beta²/2 ) * 3.1267 beta ≈ 6.25333 (1 + beta²/4 ) u.

But since beta is small, let's approximate (1 + beta²/2) ≈ 1, and (1 + beta²/4) ≈ 1.

So,

3.1267 beta ≈ 6.25333 u.

u ≈ (3.1267 / 6.25333 ) beta.

≈ 0.5 * beta.

So, u is approximately half of beta.

But we need to find u in terms of beta. Hmm.

Wait, but earlier, gamma_A = 1.56333 (1 + beta²/4 ). Also, gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta_A^2 ), where beta_A = u/c.

So,

1.56333 (1 + beta²/4 ) = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta_A^2 )

We have u ≈ 0.5 beta, so beta_A = u/c ≈ 0.5 beta.

Wait, but that's an approximation. Let me proceed with exact expressions.

Let me express beta_A in terms of beta.

But perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe a better approach is to use the two equations and solve numerically.

Let me write:

Equation 1: gamma_A = (m_p (1 + beta²/4 )) / (2 m_A )

Equation 2: gamma m_p beta = 4 gamma_A m_A u.

But gamma = 1 + beta²/2.

u is beta_A c, so u = beta_A c. So:

(1 + beta²/2 ) m_p beta = 4 gamma_A m_A beta_A.

Substituting gamma_A from equation 1,

(1 + beta²/2 ) m_p beta = 4 * [ (m_p (1 + beta²/4 )) / (2 m_A ) ] * m_A beta_A.

Simplify the right side:

4 * [ (m_p (1 + beta²/4 )) / (2 m_A ) ] * m_A beta_A

= 4 * [ m_p (1 + beta²/4 ) / (2) ) ] beta_A

= 2 m_p (1 + beta²/4 ) beta_A.

So the equation becomes:

(1 + beta²/2 ) m_p beta = 2 m_p (1 + beta²/4 ) beta_A.

Cancel m_p from both sides:

(1 + beta²/2 ) beta = 2 (1 + beta²/4 ) beta_A.

We can solve for beta_A:

beta_A = [ (1 + beta²/2 ) beta ] / [ 2 (1 + beta²/4 ) ]

= [ beta (1 + beta²/2 ) ] / [ 2 (1 + beta²/4 ) ]

Now, let's assume that beta is small, so beta² is very small. So let's expand the numerator and denominator to first order.

Numerator approximation:

1 + beta²/2 ≈ 1.

Denominator approximation:

1 + beta²/4 ≈ 1.

So,

beta_A ≈ [ beta * 1 ]/(2 * 1 ) = beta/2.

But since beta is small, perhaps higher-order terms can be considered.

Let me compute the exact expression for beta_A:

beta_A = [ beta (1 + beta²/2 ) ] / [ 2 (1 + beta²/4 ) ]

= beta [ (1 + (beta^2)/2 ) / (2 (1 + (beta^2)/4 )) ) ]

Let me factor 1/2:

= beta [ (1 + (beta^2)/2 ) / (2 (1 + (beta^2)/4 )) ) ]

= (beta/2 ) * [ (1 + (beta^2)/2 ) / (1 + (beta^2)/4 ) ]

= (beta/2 ) [ 1 + (beta^2/2 ) ) ] / [ 1 + (beta^2/4 ) ]

Using the approximation 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 - x + x^2 - ... for small x,

Denominator: 1 + (beta^2/4 ) ≈ 1 - (beta^2/4 ) when reciprocal is taken.

Wait, no, let me compute the ratio:

(1 + a ) / (1 + b ) ≈ (1 + a)(1 - b + b^2 ) for small a and b.

Here, a = beta²/2, b= beta²/4.

So,

(1 + a ) / (1 + b ) ≈ (1 + a) (1 - b + b^2 ) ≈ 1 + a - b + a b terms.

But since a and b are small, higher order terms can be neglected.

So,

(1 + a ) / (1 + b ) ≈ 1 + (a - b).

Which is 1 + (beta^2/2 - beta^2/4 ) = 1 + beta^2/4.

So,

beta_A ≈ (beta/2) [ 1 + beta^2/4 ]

≈ (beta/2 ) + (beta^3 )/(8 )

But since beta is small, the second term is negligible, so beta_A ≈ beta/2.

But this doesn't help much, because we have beta_A in terms of beta, but it's still a circular dependency.

So perhaps the initial approximation that beta is small holds, but then the velocity of the A particles would be about half the velocity of the antiproton. So if the antiproton is moving at, say, 0.1c, then the A particles would be moving at about 0.05c. But that would contradict with the earlier approximation leading to 0.77c.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the initial approximation (gamma=1) leads to beta_A=0.77c, which is about 0.77c. But if the antiproton is moving, then the available energy is higher, so the A particles have higher energy, which would require a higher gamma, leading to a higher beta_A.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me think again.

If the antiproton is moving, then the initial energy is higher, which would allow the A particles to have higher energy, leading to higher velocity.

Wait, in the initial approximation where the antiproton is at rest, the A particles have velocity 0.77c.

But when the antiproton is moving, the available energy is higher, so the A particles would have higher velocity. So perhaps the correct answer is higher than 0.77c, so maybe option B (0.96c) or option C (0.91c) or D (0.86c).

Wait, but I'm getting a bit lost here. Maybe I should think about the problem in the center of mass frame.

In the center of mass frame, the initial momentum is zero. So the total energy is 2 m_p c².

The products are four A particles with rest mass 300 MeV each, so total rest mass is 1200 MeV.

The available energy is 2 m_p c^2 - 1200 MeV = 1876 - 1200 = 676 MeV.

The kinetic energy is distributed among the four A particles, so each would have an average of 169 MeV.

The kinetic energy per A is K = gamma m_A c^2 - m_A c^2 = (gamma -1 ) m_A c^2.

So,

(gamma -1 ) m_A c^2 = 169 MeV.

gamma -1 = 169 / 300 ≈ 0.5633.

gamma ≈ 1.5633.

Which again gives beta ≈ sqrt(1 - (1/(1.5633)^2 )) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.4096) ≈ sqrt(0.5904) ≈ 0.768, so 0.77c.

But wait, this is in the center of mass frame. But in the lab frame, where the antiproton is moving, the A particles' velocities would be different.

Wait, but the problem asks for the velocity of the particles in the lab frame, I think. Because it's an annihilation process, the products would be in the lab frame.

Hmm, but how to relate the velocities in the two frames.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the reaction happens in the center of mass frame, so the A particles are moving with velocity 0.77c. So option A.

But I'm not sure. The problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly, but doesn't specify the frame. So perhaps the correct approach is to calculate in the center of mass frame, and the velocities are as found.

Wait, but in the center of mass frame, the velocity would be 0.77c as calculated. But the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly, which suggests the lab frame where it's moving. So perhaps the correct approach is to calculate in the lab frame, not the center of mass.

But I'm getting stuck. Given the time I've spent, perhaps the correct answer is option A, 0.77c.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the annihilation process \( p + \bar{p} \rightarrow 2A^+ + 2A^- \) using conservation of energy and momentum. The antiproton is stated to be moving slowly, implying its velocity \( v \) is much smaller than the speed of light \( c \). The rest energy of each \( A \)-particle is given as \( m_A c^2 = 300 \, \text{MeV} \).

### Key Assumptions and Approach:
1. **Initial Energy and Momentum**:
   - The proton is at rest, so its energy is \( m_p c^2 \), where \( m_p \approx 938 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \).
   - The antiproton is moving slowly, so its energy is approximately \( \gamma m_p c^2 \), where \( \gamma \approx 1 \) due to the low velocity. Thus, the total initial energy is approximately \( 2 m_p c^2 \).

2. **Final Energy and Momentum**:
   - The products are four \( A \)-particles, each with rest energy \( m_A c^2 = 300 \, \text{MeV} \). The total rest energy of the products is \( 4 m_A c^2 = 1200 \, \text{MeV} \).
   - The total energy available for the \( A \)-particles is the initial energy minus the rest energy of the products:  
     \[
     E_{\text{available}} = 2 m_p c^2 - 4 m_A c^2 = 1876 \, \text{MeV} - 1200 \, \text{MeV} = 676 \, \text{MeV}.
     \]

3. **Relating Energy and Velocity**:
   - Each \( A \)-particle has an energy of \( \gamma_A m_A c^2 \), where \( \gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - u^2/c^2}} \) and \( u \) is the velocity of the \( A \)-particles.
   - The total energy of the \( A \)-particles is \( 4 \gamma_A m_A c^2 \). Using energy conservation:
     \[
     2 m_p c^2 = 4 \gamma_A m_A c^2.
     \]
   - Solving for \( \gamma_A \):
     \[
     \gamma_A = \frac{2 m_p}{4 m_A} = \frac{m_p}{2 m_A} = \frac{938}{2 \times 300} \approx 1.563.
     \]

4. **Calculating the Velocity**:
   - Using \( \gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - u^2/c^2}} \), we solve for \( u \):
     \[
     \sqrt{1 - u^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{\gamma_A} \approx \frac{1}{1.563} \approx 0.64.
     \]
     \[
     1 - u^2/c^2 \approx 0.4096 \quad \Rightarrow \quad u^2/c^2 \approx 0.5904.
     \]
     \[
     u \approx c \sqrt{0.5904} \approx 0.768c.
     \]

### Conclusion:
The velocity of each \( A \)-particle is approximately \( 0.77c \), which corresponds to option **A**.
