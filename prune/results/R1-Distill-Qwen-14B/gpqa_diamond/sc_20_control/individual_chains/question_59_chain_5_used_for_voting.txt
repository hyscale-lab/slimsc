Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me try to think it through. The question is about determining the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. Hmm, sounds like a titration or neutralization problem. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So I should probably calculate the moles of each acid and base and see what's left after they react.

The solutions are:
1. 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (acetic acid)
2. 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (strong acid)
3. 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (strong base)

Wait, wait. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, right? And both HCl and CH3COOH are acids—HCl is strong, CH3COOH is weak. So first, I think I should figure out how much H+ and OH- are coming from each solution, but wait, it's better to think in terms of moles reacting.

Wait, but when you mix all these together, the H+ from the acids will react with the OH- from the base. But since the acid and base can have different strengths, the neutralization will depend on their amounts.

So, let's compute the moles for each component.

Molarity (M) is moles per liter, so moles = M * volume in liters.

Starting with CH3COOH: 500 mL is 0.5 L. So moles = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles.

HCl is strong acid, so it will dissociate completely. 400 mL is 0.4 L. Moles HCl = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles. Since HCl is a strong acid, each mole gives one mole of H+.

Ba(OH)2: 300 mL is 0.3 L. Molarity is 0.3 M, so moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. But Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH-. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-. So moles OH- = 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, let's consider the H+ and OH- contributions. The total H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH. But wait, HCl is strong, so it will donate all its H+. CH3COOH is weak, so it won't fully dissociate, but in the presence of a strong acid and base, perhaps the weak acid's contribution is negligible? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, but in this case, since the solution is being mixed with excess of either acid or base, maybe the weak acid doesn't contribute much. Hmm, but maybe I should include it.

Wait, but let's think about the neutralization reaction. The OH- from the base will react with the H+ from the acids. So the total H+ available is from HCl and CH3COOH (but wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't release H+ as much as a strong acid. Or does it? Wait, in the solution, the H+ from HCl is high, which could suppress the dissociation of CH3COOH because of the common ion effect. So maybe CH3COOH doesn't contribute much H+ in this case. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should assume that the HCl is a strong acid and that the OH- will neutralize some of it, and then the remaining H+ will determine the pH. But perhaps the CH3COOH is negligible. Alternatively, it might contribute a little.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to first calculate the moles of H+ and OH-.

Wait, let's calculate total H+ from HCl and CH3COOH, and total OH- from Ba(OH)2.

Wait, wait, HCl gives 0.08 moles H+, Ba(OH)2 gives 0.18 moles OH-. But wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid and doesn't fully dissociate. So the H+ from CH3COOH is less than 0.05 moles. But in the presence of excess H+ from HCl, maybe the CH3COOH doesn't contribute much H+ because of the common ion effect. Hmm, but wait, the HCl is strong and will donate all its H+, so the solution's pH will be determined by the excess H+ or OH- after neutralization.

So, let's think: The H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles. The OH- is 0.18. So when mixed, OH- will react with H+.

The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

So the moles of H+ after reaction: 0.08 - 0.18. Wait, but 0.08 is less than 0.18, so H+ will be zero, and excess OH- will be 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles.

Wait, but I'm not considering the CH3COOH yet. Oh right, because I added CH3COOH, which is an acid. So the CH3COOH will provide some H+.

Wait, so let me correct that. The total H+ is HCl's H+ plus CH3COOH's H+.

But CH3COOH's H+ is a bit more complex because it's a weak acid. So, let's think: when you mix an acid (CH3COOH) with another acid (HCl) and a base (Ba(OH)2), the H+ from the strong acid (HCl) is in high concentration, which will affect the dissociation of the weak acid.

But perhaps, in this case, the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will first neutralize the H+ from HCl, and then any remaining OH- will neutralize the H+ from CH3COOH.

Wait, let me structure this step by step.

1. Find moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol.

2. Find moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 mol.

3. OH- reacts with H+ from HCl first.

So, moles after HCl and Ba(OH)2 react: H+ = 0.08 - 0.18 × (since OH- is in excess). Wait, no, it's H+ and OH- reacting in a 1:1 ratio. So if H+ is 0.08 and OH- is 0.18, the reaction will neutralize 0.08 moles of OH- and 0.08 moles of H+.

So the remaining OH- is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles.

But, the CH3COOH is present as an acid as well. So the remaining OH- will react with the CH3COOH. Because CH3COOH is a weak acid, but in this case, it's in a solution with excess OH-.

So the OH- will react with any available H+ from CH3COOH.

But wait, the CH3COOH is 0.05 moles. The remaining OH- is 0.10 moles.

So, the OH- will react with CH3COOH. The reaction is: CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So, each mole of OH- will consume one mole of CH3COOH and produce one mole of acetate.

So, we have 0.05 moles of CH3COOH and 0.10 moles of OH-.

They will react in a 1:1 ratio. So 0.05 moles of CH3COOH will react with 0.05 moles of OH-.

So after reaction, moles of CH3COO^- (acetate) will be 0.05, and OH- will be 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles.

Wait, but wait, did I get that right? Let me recheck.

Initial OH- after reacting with HCl: 0.10 moles.

Then, OH- reacts with CH3COOH. Since OH- is 0.10 and CH3COOH is 0.05, all the CH3COOH will be consumed, and the OH- will be reduced by 0.05, leaving 0.05 moles OH-.

So after all reactions, the solution will have:

- Excess OH-: 0.05 moles.

- Acetate ions (CH3COO^-): 0.05 moles.

So, the solution will have excess OH- and a weak base (acetate) which can hydrolyze in water to produce more OH-.

So, the pH will be determined by the excess OH- and the hydrolysis of the acetate ions.

Wait, but which is more significant? The excess OH- is 0.05 moles, and the acetate is also 0.05. Let's see.

Wait, but the hydrolysis of acetate is a weak base reaction: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH-.

So, the acetate ions can contribute some OH-.

But I'm not sure which is dominant—the excess OH- from Ba(OH)2 or the OH- from the acetate hydrolysis.

Wait, the excess OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.05 moles, and the acetate is 0.05 moles. So in the solution, both could contribute to the OH- concentration.

But let's first calculate the total volume of the solution. The volumes are 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So, the concentration of excess OH- is 0.05 moles / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0417 M.

The concentration of acetate is also 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0417 M.

So, the acetate will hydrolyze:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH-

The Kb for acetate can be found from the Ka of acetic acid. Acetic acid has a Ka of 1.8 × 10^-5. The Kb for acetate is Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.8e-5) ≈ 5.56e-10.

So Kb is 5.56e-10, which is very small. So the hydrolysis will produce a tiny amount of OH-.

The initial OH- concentration from excess is 0.0417 M, which is much higher than the amount produced by the acetate hydrolysis. So, perhaps the contribution from the acetate's Kb is negligible compared to the excess OH-.

So, maybe the pH can be approximated by the excess OH-.

But wait, let's calculate the OH- concentration from both sources.

First, the excess OH- is 0.05 moles in 1.2 L → 0.0417 M.

Then, the acetate hydrolysis: Let's denote the concentration of acetate as c = 0.0417 M.

The hydrolysis reaction has Kb = 5.56e-10.

The expression for Kb is [CH3COOH][OH-] / [CH3COO^-].

Assuming x is the amount of OH- produced from hydrolysis, the change would be:

[CH3COO^-] = c - x ≈ c (since x is small)

[OH-] = initial_conc + x ≈ 0.0417 + x

But since Kb is very small, x should be much smaller than 0.0417. Let's try to compute it.

So, Kb ≈ (x)(0.0417 + x) / (0.0417) ≈ x (since 0.0417 +x ≈ 0.0417)

So, 5.56e-10 ≈ x * 0.0417 / 0.0417 → x ≈ 5.56e-10.

Wait, no. Let me set it up correctly. Let's denote [OH-] as (0.0417 + x), but since x is negligible compared to 0.0417, perhaps we can approximate [OH-] ≈ 0.0417.

So Kb ≈ (x)(0.0417) / (0.0417 - x) ≈ x = 5.56e-10.

So x ≈ 5.56e-10 M. But wait, that can't be right because Kb is very small, so x is even smaller.

Wait, perhaps I should set up the equation properly.

Let me let [OH-] = 0.0417 + x. Then,

Kb = (x)(0.0417 + x) / (0.0417 - x) ≈ (x)(0.0417) / 0.0417 ) = x.

Because x is much smaller than 0.0417, so 0.0417 + x ≈ 0.0417, and 0.0417 - x ≈ 0.0417.

So Kb ≈ x. So x = 5.56e-10.

So the additional OH- from acetate hydrolysis is 5.56e-10 M, which is way smaller than the 0.0417 M from excess OH-.

Therefore, the dominant source of OH- is the excess from Ba(OH)2.

So, the total OH- concentration is approximately 0.0417 M.

Wait, but wait—the OH- concentration is 0.0417 M. So pOH is log(0.0417) → approximately 1.38. Because log(0.04) is about 1.39794, and 0.0417 is a bit higher, maybe around 1.38.

pOH ≈ 1.38 → pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

Wait, but that's one of the options. Option A is 12.62.

But wait, wait a minute—am I making a mistake here? Because when you mix these solutions, you have 1.2 liters, and the excess OH- is 0.05 moles, so 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.0416667 M.

But wait, another thought: perhaps I have a miscalculation in the initial moles.

Wait, let me recompute the moles.

HCl: 400 mL * 0.2 M = 0.08 moles H+.

Ba(OH)2: 300 mL * 0.3 M = 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.18 moles OH-.

So, H+ from HCl is 0.08. OH- is 0.18.

So, when H+ and OH- react, the H+ is 0.08, OH- is 0.18.

So, they neutralize each other, and the remaining OH- is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles.

Then, this remaining OH- reacts with CH3COOH.

CH3COOH is 0.05 moles. So, OH- (0.10) will react with CH3COOH (0.05), neutralizing all of the CH3COOH and leaving 0.05 moles OH-.

So, the excess OH- is 0.05 moles in 1.2 L → 0.0416667 M.

So, the pH is determined by this excess OH-.

So, [OH-] = 0.0416667 M → pOH = log(0.0416667) → let's compute that.

Log(4.16667e-2) → log(4.16667) is about 0.619, so 0.619 - 2 = -1.381. Wait, no, wait. No, wait, 4.16667e-2 is 0.0416667. So log(0.0416667) is log(4.16667 * 1e-2) = log(4.16667) + log(1e-2) → log(4.16667) is about 0.6198, so 0.6198 - 2 = -1.3802. But pOH is negative log, so pOH = -log(0.0416667) = 1.3802.

So pH = 14 - 1.3802 = 12.6198, which is approximately 12.62. So option A.

But wait, the options are:

A) 12.62

B) 1.38

C) 8.92

D) 8.68

So, the correct answer would be A) 12.62.

Wait, but let me think again. Because the acetate ion is present in the solution, which is a weak base, so it could contribute to the OH- concentration. But as we calculated earlier, the contribution is negligible because Kb is very small.

So, the pH should be approximately 12.62, which is option A.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps after the neutralization, the solution contains excess OH- of 0.05 moles and the acetate ions. So, the solution would have a basic pH. The presence of acetate would only slightly increase the OH- concentration, but since it's a weak base, the effect is minimal, so the pH is dominated by the excess OH-.

Therefore, the pH is around 12.62. So the answer is option A.

To determine the pH of the solution formed by mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M CH₃COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)₂, we analyze the moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ and their neutralization reactions.

### Step 1: Calculate moles of H⁺ and OH⁻
1. **H⁺ from HCl**:  
   HCl is a strong acid, so it fully dissociates.  
   Moles of H⁺ = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{moles} \).

2. **OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂**:  
   Ba(OH)₂ dissociates into one Ba²⁺ and two OH⁻ ions.  
   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{moles} \).  
   Moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles} \).

3. **H⁺ from CH₃COOH**:  
   CH₃COOH is a weak acid, and its contribution to H⁺ is small. However, it will react with excess OH⁻ after neutralization.

### Step 2: Neutralization reaction
1. **Reaction between H⁺ (from HCl) and OH⁻ (from Ba(OH)₂)**:  
   H⁺ reacts with OH⁻ in a 1:1 ratio:  
   \[
   \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \rightarrow \text{H₂O}.
   \]  
   Moles of H⁺ = 0.08, moles of OH⁻ = 0.18.  
   After neutralization:  
   - Remaining OH⁻ = \( 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{moles} \).  
   - Remaining H⁺ = \( 0.08 - 0.08 = 0 \, \text{moles} \).

2. **Reaction between excess OH⁻ and CH₃COOH**:  
   OH⁻ reacts with CH₃COOH:  
   \[
   \text{CH₃COOH} + \text{OH⁻} \rightarrow \text{CH₃COO⁻} + \text{H₂O}.
   \]  
   Moles of CH₃COOH = \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{moles} \).  
   OH⁻ reacts with CH₃COOH in a 1:1 ratio:  
   - Remaining OH⁻ = \( 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{moles} \).  
   - CH₃COO⁻ formed = \( 0.05 \, \text{moles} \).

### Step 3: Total moles and concentrations
- **Excess OH⁻**: \( 0.05 \, \text{moles} \).  
- **CH₃COO⁻**: \( 0.05 \, \text{moles} \).  
- **Total volume**: \( 500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L} \).  
- **[OH⁻]**:  
  \[
  [\text{OH⁻}] = \frac{\text{moles of OH⁻}}{\text{volume}} = \frac{0.05}{1.2} \approx 0.0417 \, \text{M}.
  \]

### Step 4: Calculate pH
The pH is determined by the excess OH⁻, as the contribution from CH₃COO⁻ hydrolysis is negligible due to its weak basicity.  
- **pOH**:  
  \[
  \text{pOH} = -\log[\text{OH⁻}] = -\log(0.0417) \approx 1.38.
  \]  
- **pH**:  
  \[
  \text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.
  \]

### Final Answer
The pH of the solution is **12.62**, which corresponds to **Option A**.

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me try to think it through. The question is about determining the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. Hmm, sounds like a titration or neutralization problem. Let me break it down step by step.

The solutions are:
1. 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (acetic acid)
2. 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (strong acid)
3. 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (strong base)

Wait, wait. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, right? And both HCl and CH3COOH are acids—HCl is strong, CH3COOH is weak. So first, I think I should figure out how much H+ and OH- are coming from each solution, but wait, it's better to think in terms of moles reacting.

Wait, but when you mix all these together, the H+ from the acids will react with the OH- from the base. But since the acid and base can have different strengths, the neutralization will depend on their amounts.

So, let's compute the moles for each component.

Molarity (M) is moles per liter, so moles = M * volume in liters.

Starting with CH3COOH: 500 mL is 0.5 L. So moles = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles.

HCl is strong acid, so it will dissociate completely. 400 mL is 0.4 L. Moles HCl = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles. Since HCl is a strong acid, each mole gives one mole of H+.

Ba(OH)2: 300 mL is 0.3 L. Molarity is 0.3 M, so moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. But Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH-. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-. So moles OH- = 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, let's consider the H+ and OH- contributions. The total H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH. But wait, HCl is strong, so it will donate all its H+. CH3COOH is weak, so it won't fully dissociate, but in the presence of a strong acid and base, perhaps the weak acid's contribution is negligible? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, but in this case, since the solution is being mixed with excess of either acid or base, maybe the weak acid doesn't contribute much. Hmm, but maybe I should include it.

Wait, but let's think about the neutralization reaction. The OH- from the base will react with the H+ from the acids. So the total H+ available is from HCl and CH3COOH (but wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't release H+ as much as a strong acid. Or does it? Wait, in the solution, the H+ from HCl is high, which could suppress the dissociation of CH3COOH because of the common ion effect. So maybe CH3COOH doesn't contribute much H+ in this case. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should assume that the HCl is a strong acid and that the OH- will neutralize some of it, and then the remaining H+ will determine the pH. But perhaps the CH3COOH is negligible. Alternatively, it might contribute a little.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to first calculate the moles of H+ and OH-.

Wait, let's calculate total H+ from HCl and CH3COOH, and total OH- from Ba(OH)2.

Wait, wait, HCl gives 0.08 moles H+, Ba(OH)2 gives 0.18 moles OH-. But wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid and doesn't fully dissociate. So the H+ from CH3COOH is less than 0.05 moles. But in the presence of excess H+ from HCl, maybe the CH3COOH doesn't contribute much H+ because of the common ion effect. Hmm, but wait, the HCl is strong and will donate all its H+, so the solution's pH will be determined by the excess H+ or OH- after neutralization.

So, let's think: The H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles. The OH- is 0.18. So when mixed, OH- will react with H+.

The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

So the moles of H+ after reaction: 0.08 - 0.18. Wait, but 0.08 is less than 0.18, so H+ will be zero, and excess OH- will be 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles.

Wait, but I'm not considering the CH3COOH yet. Oh right, because I added CH3COOH, which is an acid. So the CH3COOH will provide some H+.

Wait, so let me correct that. The total H+ is HCl's H+ plus CH3COOH's H+.

But CH3COOH's H+ is a bit more complex because it's a weak acid. So, let's think: when you mix an acid (CH3COOH) with another acid (HCl) and a base (Ba(OH)2), the H+ from the strong acid (HCl) is in high concentration, which will affect the dissociation of the weak acid.

But perhaps, in this case, the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will first neutralize the H+ from HCl, and then any remaining OH- will neutralize the H+ from CH3COOH.

Wait, let me structure this step by step.

1. Find moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol.

2. Find moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 mol.

3. OH- reacts with H+ from HCl first.

So, moles after HCl and Ba(OH)2 react: H+ = 0.08 - 0.18 × (since OH- is in excess). Wait, no, it's H+ and OH- reacting in a 1:1 ratio. So if H+ is 0.08 and OH- is 0.18, the reaction will neutralize 0.08 moles of OH- and 0.08 moles of H+.

So the remaining OH- is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles.

But, the CH3COOH is present as an acid as well. So the remaining OH- will react with the CH3COOH. Because CH3COOH is a weak acid, but in this case, it's in a solution with excess OH-.

So the OH- will react with any available H+ from CH3COOH.

But wait, the CH3COOH is 0.05 moles. The remaining OH- is 0.10 moles.

So, the OH- will react with CH3COOH. The reaction is: CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So, each mole of OH- will consume one mole of CH3COOH and produce one mole of acetate.

So, we have 0.05 moles of CH3COOH and 0.10 moles of OH-.

They will react in a 1:1 ratio. So 0.05 moles of CH3COOH will react with 0.05 moles of OH-.

So after reaction, moles of CH3COO^- (acetate) will be 0.05, and OH- will be 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles.

Wait, but wait, did I get that right? Let me recheck.

Initial OH- after reacting with HCl: 0.10 moles.

Then, OH- reacts with CH3COOH. Since OH- is 0.10 and CH3COOH is 0.05, all the CH3COOH will be consumed, and the OH- will be reduced by 0.05, leaving 0.05 moles OH-.

So after all reactions, the solution will have:

- Excess OH-: 0.05 moles.

- Acetate ions (CH3COO^-): 0.05 moles.

So, the solution will have excess OH- and a weak base (acetate) which can hydrolyze in water to produce more OH-.

So, the pH will be determined by the excess OH- and the hydrolysis of the acetate ions.

Wait, but which is more significant? The excess OH- is 0.05 moles, and the acetate is also 0.05. Let's see.

Wait, but the hydrolysis of acetate is a weak base reaction: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH-.

So, the acetate ions can contribute some OH-.

But I'm not sure which is dominant—the excess OH- from Ba(OH)2 or the OH- from the acetate hydrolysis.

Wait, the excess OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.05 moles, and the acetate is 0.05 moles. So in the solution, both could contribute to the OH- concentration.

But let's first calculate the total volume of the solution. The volumes are 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So, the concentration of excess OH- is 0.05 moles / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0417 M.

The concentration of acetate is also 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0417 M.

So, the acetate will hydrolyze:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH-

The Kb for acetate can be found from the Ka of acetic acid. Acetic acid has a Ka of 1.8 × 10^-5. The Kb for acetate is Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.8e-5) ≈ 5.56e-10.

So Kb is 5.56e-10, which is very small. So the hydrolysis will produce a tiny amount of OH-.

The initial OH- concentration from excess is 0.0417 M, which is much higher than the amount produced by the acetate hydrolysis. So, perhaps the contribution from the acetate's Kb is negligible compared to the excess OH-.

So, maybe the pH can be approximated by the excess OH-.

But wait, let's calculate the OH- concentration from both sources.

First, the excess OH- is 0.05 moles in 1.2 L → 0.0417 M.

Then, the acetate hydrolysis: Let's denote the concentration of acetate as c = 0.0417 M.

The hydrolysis reaction has Kb = 5.56e-10.

The expression for Kb is [CH3COOH][OH-] / [CH3COO^-].

Assuming x is the amount of OH- produced from hydrolysis, the change would be:

[CH3COO^-] = c - x ≈ c (since x is small)

[OH-] = initial_conc + x ≈ 0.0417 + x

But since Kb is very small, x should be much smaller than 0.0417. Let's try to compute it.

So, Kb ≈ (x)(0.0417 + x) / (0.0417) ≈ x (since 0.0417 +x ≈ 0.0417)

So, 5.56e-10 ≈ x * 0.0417 / 0.0417 → x ≈ 5.56e-10.

Wait, no. Let me set it up correctly. Let's denote [OH-] as (0.0417 + x), but since x is negligible compared to 0.0417, perhaps we can approximate [OH-] ≈ 0.0417.

So Kb ≈ (x)(0.0417) / (0.0417 - x) ≈ x = 5.56e-10.

So x ≈ 5.56e-10 M. But wait, that can't be right because Kb is very small, so x is even smaller.

Wait, perhaps I should set up the equation properly.

Let me let [OH-] = 0.0417 + x. Then,

Kb = (x)(0.0417 + x) / (0.0417 - x) ≈ (x)(0.0417) / 0.0417 ) = x.

Because x is much smaller than 0.0417, so 0.0417 + x ≈ 0.0417, and 0.0417 - x ≈ 0.0417.

So Kb ≈ x. So x = 5.56e-10.

So the additional OH- from acetate hydrolysis is 5.56e-10 M, which is way smaller than the 0.0417 M from excess OH-.

Therefore, the dominant source of OH- is the excess from Ba(OH)2.

So, the total OH- concentration is approximately 0.0417 M.

Wait, but wait—the OH- concentration is 0.0417 M. So pOH is log(0.0417) → approximately 1.38. Because log(0.04) is about 1.39794, and 0.0417 is a bit higher, maybe around 1.38.

pOH ≈ 1.38 → pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

Wait, but that's one of the options. Option A is 12.62.

But wait, wait a minute—am I making a mistake here? Because when you mix these solutions, you have 1.2 liters, and the excess OH- is 0.05 moles, so 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.0416667 M.

But wait, another thought: perhaps I have a miscalculation in the initial moles.

Wait, let me recompute the moles.

HCl: 400 mL * 0.2 M = 0.08 moles H+.

Ba(OH)2: 300 mL * 0.3 M = 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.18 moles OH-.

So, H+ from HCl is 0.08. OH- is 0.18.

So, when H+ and OH- react, the H+ is 0.08, OH- is 0.18.

So, they neutralize each other, and the remaining OH- is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles.

Then, this remaining OH- reacts with CH3COOH.

CH3COOH is 0.05 moles. So, OH- (0.10) will react with CH3COOH (0.05), neutralizing all of the CH3COOH and leaving 0.05 moles OH-.

So, the excess OH- is 0.05 moles in 1.2 L → 0.0416667 M.

So, the pH is determined by this excess OH-.

So, [OH-] = 0.0416667 M → pOH = log(0.0416667) → let's compute that.

Log(4.16667e-2) → log(4.16667) is about 0.619, so 0.619 - 2 = -1.381. Wait, no, wait. No, wait, 4.16667e-2 is 0.0416667. So log(0.0416667) is log(4.16667 * 1e-2) = log(4.16667) + log(1e-2) → log(4.16667) is about 0.6198, so 0.6198 - 2 = -1.3802. But pOH is negative log, so pOH = -log(0.0416667) = 1.3802.

So pH = 14 - 1.3802 = 12.6198, which is approximately 12.62. So option A.

But wait, the options are:

A) 12.62

B) 1.38

C) 8.92

D) 8.68

So, the correct answer would be A) 12.62.

Wait, but let me think again. Because the acetate ion is present in the solution, which is a weak base, so it could contribute to the OH- concentration. But as we calculated earlier, the contribution is negligible because Kb is very small.

So, the pH should be approximately 12.62, which is option A.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps after the neutralization, the solution contains excess OH- of 0.05 moles and the acetate ions. So, the solution would have a basic pH. The presence of acetate would only slightly increase the OH- concentration, but since it's a weak base, the effect is minimal, so the pH is dominated by the excess OH-.

Therefore, the pH is around 12.62. So the answer is option A.


To determine the pH of the solution formed by mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M CH₃COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)₂, we analyze the moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ and their neutralization reactions.

### Step 1: Calculate moles of H⁺ and OH⁻
1. **H⁺ from HCl**:  
   HCl is a strong acid, so it fully dissociates.  
   Moles of H⁺ = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{moles} \).

2. **OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂**:  
   Ba(OH)₂ dissociates into one Ba²⁺ and two OH⁻ ions.  
   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{moles} \).  
   Moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles} \).

3. **H⁺ from CH₃COOH**:  
   CH₃COOH is a weak acid, and its contribution to H⁺ is small. However, it will react with excess OH⁻ after neutralization.

### Step 2: Neutralization reaction
1. **Reaction between H⁺ (from HCl) and OH⁻ (from Ba(OH)₂)**:  
   H⁺ reacts with OH⁻ in a 1:1 ratio:  
   \[
   \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \rightarrow \text{H₂O}.
   \]  
   Moles of H⁺ = 0.08, moles of OH⁻ = 0.18.  
   After neutralization:  
   - Remaining OH⁻ = \( 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{moles} \).  
   - Remaining H⁺ = \( 0.08 - 0.08 = 0 \, \text{moles} \).

2. **Reaction between excess OH⁻ and CH₃COOH**:  
   OH⁻ reacts with CH₃COOH:  
   \[
   \text{CH₃COOH} + \text{OH⁻} \rightarrow \text{CH₃COO⁻} + \text{H₂O}.
   \]  
   Moles of CH₃COOH = \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{moles} \).  
   OH⁻ reacts with CH₃COOH in a 1:1 ratio:  
   - Remaining OH⁻ = \( 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{moles} \).  
   - CH₃COO⁻ formed = \( 0.05 \, \text{moles} \).

### Step 3: Total moles and concentrations
- **Excess OH⁻**: \( 0.05 \, \text{moles} \).  
- **CH₃COO⁻**: \( 0.05 \, \text{moles} \).  
- **Total volume**: \( 500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L} \).  
- **[OH⁻]**:  
  \[
  [\text{OH⁻}] = \frac{\text{moles of OH⁻}}{\text{volume}} = \frac{0.05}{1.2} \approx 0.0417 \, \text{M}.
  \]

### Step 4: Calculate pH
The pH is determined by the excess OH⁻, as the contribution from CH₃COO⁻ hydrolysis is negligible due to its weak basicity.  
- **pOH**:  
  \[
  \text{pOH} = -\log[\text{OH⁻}] = -\log(0.0417) \approx 1.38.
  \]  
- **pH**:  
  \[
  \text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.
  \]

### Final Answer
The pH of the solution is **12.62**, which corresponds to **Option A**.
