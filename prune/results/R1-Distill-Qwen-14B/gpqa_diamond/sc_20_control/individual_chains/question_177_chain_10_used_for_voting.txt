Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given information is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, its mass is 1.5 times larger. The problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, wait, that's about their peak emission wavelengths. And the radial velocities are given as 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. 

The question is about the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's. The options are A to D, with various approximate factors.

Hmm, I remember that the luminosity of a star can be determined using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power.

First, I need to find the luminosity ratio between Star_1 and Star_2. So L1 / L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴).

Given that R1 is 1.5 R2. So R1/R2 is 1.5, so R1²/R2² is (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

Now, what about the temperatures? Well, the stars appear brightest at the same wavelengths. I think that relates to their temperatures because of Wien's law. Wien's displacement law says that the peak wavelength λ_max is proportional to 1/T. So λ_max is the same, which would imply that T is the same. Wait, if λ_max is the same, then T1 = T2. So the T term in the luminosity ratio would be (T1/T2)^4 = 1^4 = 1.

Wait, but then L1/L2 would just be (2.25) * 1 = 2.25. So the luminosity ratio is 2.25 times. But wait, that would suggest option A is correct. But wait, the problem also mentions radial velocities. Oh right, because the stars' velocities might affect their observed temperatures due to the Doppler effect.

Oh, right, because when a star is moving towards or away from us, there's a Doppler shift in the observed wavelengths. So the radial velocities given (v) could affect the observed temperature because of this effect.

Hmm. Let's think about that. The radial velocity is 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. So Star_2 is moving away from us at 700 km/s. Wait, no, wait. Wait, radial velocity is the component of the star's velocity along the line of sight. If it's moving towards us, the observed wavelength is blueshifted; if moving away, it's redshifted. So if Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, assuming that's away from us, then the observed wavelength would be longer (redshifted).

But how does that affect the temperature? Since the peak wavelength λ_max is observed. If the actual star emits at λ_max, but due to Doppler shift, the observed λ is different. Wait, but in the problem statement, it says the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, which are the same. So maybe they accounted for the Doppler shift, or perhaps the velocities are causing the observed λ_max to be the same.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Let's say the actual temperature of Star_2 is T2, and because it's moving away at 700 km/s, the observed wavelength for its peak would be longer. But the problem says that the observed wavelengths are the same for both stars. So the observed λ_max for Star_1 is λ1_obs, and for Star_2 is λ2_obs, and they are equal.

But what's λ_max for each star? The actual λ_max (emitted) for each is given by Wien's law as λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. But if the star is moving, the observed λ would be different. So the observed λ_max_obs = λ_max (emitted) * (1 + v/c), assuming v is positive when moving away. Wait, no, wait: the Doppler effect formula for wavelength shift is λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ) when moving away. Wait, no, the relativistic Doppler shift formula for wavelength when moving away is λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ), but for non-relativistic speeds, v << c, we can approximate it as λ_obs ≈ λ_emit * (1 + v/c).

Wait, but for a more precise approach, perhaps we can use the approximation that the observed wavelength is longer by a factor of (1 + v/c), where v is the radial velocity (positive when receding). So for Star_1, its v is zero, so λ1_obs = λ1_emit. For Star_2, v is 700 km/s, so λ2_obs = λ2_emit * (1 + 700e3 / c ), where c is the speed of light. Since 700 km/s is about 0.00233c (since c is about 3e5 km/s), so the approximation would be λ2_obs ≈ λ2_emit * (1 + 0.00233).

But the problem states that λ1_obs = λ2_obs = λ_obs. So λ1_emit = λ_obs, and λ2_emit * (1 + v2/c) = λ_obs. So λ2_emit = λ_obs / (1 + v2/c) ≈ λ_obs * (1 - v2/c), using the approximation that 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 - x for small x.

So the actual λ_emit of Star_2 is less than λ_obs. Because if a star is moving away, the observed λ is longer than emitted λ. So λ_emit = λ_obs / (1 + v/c) ≈ λ_obs (1 - v/c).

Wait, but according to the problem statement, the stars' observed wavelengths are the same. So λ1_emit = λ_obs, and λ2_emit = λ_obs / (1 + v2/c). Thus, λ2_emit < λ1_emit.

But since λ_max is inversely proportional to T, higher T means shorter λ_max. So if λ2_emit is less than λ1_emit, then T2 is higher than T1. Because λ_max = b / T, so T = b / λ_max.

Wait, that may be the case. Let me write it down.

For Star_1:
λ1_obs = λ1_emit (since v1 = 0)
So λ1_emit = λ_obs.

For Star_2:
λ2_obs = λ2_emit * (1 + v2/c)
So λ2_emit = λ_obs / (1 + v2/c) ≈ λ_obs (1 - v2/c) [using binomial approx for small v2/c].

So λ2_emit ≈ λ_obs (1 - 700e3 / 3e5)
= λ_obs (1 - 0.002333)
≈ 0.99767 * λ_obs.

So λ2_emit is shorter than λ1_emit. Therefore, T2 is higher than T1.

Because, λ = b / T → T = b / λ. So T2 = b / λ2_emit = b/(0.99767 λ_obs) ≈ (1/0.99767) * (b/ λ_obs) ) = approx (1.0023)*T1.

Because T1 = b / λ1_emit = b / λ_obs.

So T2 ≈ T1 * (1/(0.99767)) ≈ T1 * 1.00234.

Hmm, so the temperature of Star_2 is slightly higher than that of Star_1. So not the same, which is what I initially thought. That changes things because earlier I assumed T1 = T2.

Wait, but the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So I think I have to account for the Doppler shift when determining their actual temperatures.

So let's model this. Let me denote:

λ1_obs = λ2_obs = λ.

For Star_1, v1 = 0 → λ1_obs = λ1_emit → λ1_emit = λ.

For Star_2, v2 = 700 km/s away → λ2_obs = λ2_emit * (1 + v2/c).

So λ2_emit = λ / (1 + v2/c).

Now, using Wien's law: λ_max (emitted) = b / T.

So for Star_1: λ1_emit = b / T1 → T1 = b / λ1_emit = b / λ.

For Star_2: λ2_emit = b / T2 → T2 = b / λ2_emit = b / (λ / (1 + v2/c)) ) = b (1 + v2/c) / λ = (1 + v2/c) * T1.

Since v2 is positive (700 km/s away), (1 + v2/c) is about 1.00233. So T2 = T1 * 1.00233.

Wait, that's a small increase in temperature. So T2 is a bit higher than T1.

So now, the luminosity ratio is L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴).

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2. So R1² = 2.25 R2².

So L1/L2 = (2.25) * (T1^4) / (T2^4).

But T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c) → T2 = T1 * (1 + 700e3/(3e5)) ≈ T1 * (1 + 0.002333).

So T2 ≈ T1 * 1.002333.

Thus, T2^4 ≈ (T1)^4 * (1.002333)^4.

But wait, (1.002333)^4 is approximately what? Let's compute that.

(1.002333)^2 ≈ 1 + 2*(0.002333) + (0.002333)^2 ≈ 1 + 0.004666 + 0.0000054 ≈ 1.0046714.

Then, (1.0046714)^2 ≈ 1 + 2*(0.0046714) + (0.0046714)^2 ≈ 1 + 0.0093428 + 0.0000218 ≈ 1.0093646.

Wait, that's (1.002333)^4 ≈ around 1.00936.

So T2^4 ≈ T1^4 * 1.00936.

So putting it all into L1/L2:

L1/L2 = 2.25 * (T1^4) / (T1^4 * 1.00936) ) = 2.25 / 1.00936 ≈ ?

Let me calculate 2.25 divided by 1.00936.

2.25 / 1.00936 ≈ approximately 2.229.

Wait, 1.00936 is approximately 1.00936. Let's compute 2.25 / 1.00936:

Well, 1.00936 is about 1.00936.

So 2.25 ÷ 1.00936 ≈ let's think:

1.00936 is close to 1.01.

So 2.25 / 1.01 is approximately 2.2277.

But let's compute more accurately.

Compute 1.00936 * 2.22 = ?

1.00936 * 2 = 2.01872.

1.00936 * 0.22 = approximately 0.2220592.

So 2.01872 + 0.2220592 ≈ 2.2407792. That's 1.00936 *2.22 ≈2.24078.

But we're looking for 2.25 /1.00936. Let me compute 1.00936 * x = 2.25.

x = 2.25 / 1.00936.

Let me compute 1.00936 * 2.225 = ?

1.00936 *2 = 2.01872.

1.00936 *0.225 = 0.227202.

Adding, 2.01872 +0.227202=2.245922. So 2.225 gives 2.245922. We need to reach 2.25.

The difference is 2.25 -2.245922 = 0.004078.

How much more do we need to add to x (2.225) to get to 2.25?

Each 0.001 in x adds about 1.00936 *0.001 =0.00100936 to the product. We need 0.004078 more.

So 0.004078 / 0.00100936 ≈4.04. So, approximately 4.04 * 0.001 → x ≈ 2.225 + 0.00404 → 2.22904.

So L1/L2 ≈ 2.229, which is approximately 2.23.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but why am I getting this? Because when considering the Doppler shift, the temperature of Star_2 is slightly higher than Star_1. So when computing luminosity, which is proportional to R² T^4, since R1 is larger and T1 is a bit lower than T2, the overall effect is a luminosity ratio less than 2.25.

Wait, but earlier, I thought that T2 is higher, so T2^4 is higher, which would make the denominator larger, thus reducing the ratio. So that makes sense. So the ratio is a bit less than 2.25, so around 2.22 or 2.23.

Looking at the options, the closest is D) ~2.23. So the correct answer should be D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the luminosity ratio between Star_1 and Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the luminosity \( L \) of a star is proportional to \( R^2 T^4 \), where \( R \) is the radius and \( T \) is the temperature. The luminosity ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}.
\]

### Step 1: Radius Ratio
The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2, i.e., \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \). Therefore:

\[
\frac{R_1^2}{R_2^2} = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.
\]

### Step 2: Temperature Ratio
The problem also states that the observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest (\( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \)) are the same for both stars. Using Wien's law, \( \lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T} \), where \( b \) is Wien's displacement constant, the temperature of a star is inversely proportional to its peak wavelength. However, the observed wavelength is affected by the Doppler effect due to the radial velocity of the star.

#### For Star_1:
Since Star_1 has a radial velocity of \( v_1 = 0 \), its observed wavelength is the same as its emitted wavelength:
\[
\lambda_{1, \text{obs}} = \lambda_{1, \text{emit}}.
\]

#### For Star_2:
Star_2 has a radial velocity of \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \) (receding). The observed wavelength is related to the emitted wavelength by the Doppler shift formula:
\[
\lambda_{2, \text{obs}} = \lambda_{2, \text{emit}} \left( 1 + \frac{v_2}{c} \right),
\]
where \( c \) is the speed of light. Rearranging, the emitted wavelength of Star_2 is:
\[
\lambda_{2, \text{emit}} = \frac{\lambda_{2, \text{obs}}}{1 + \frac{v_2}{c}}.
\]

Since \( \lambda_{1, \text{obs}} = \lambda_{2, \text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{obs}} \), we have:
\[
\lambda_{2, \text{emit}} = \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}}}{1 + \frac{v_2}{c}}.
\]

Using the approximation \( 1 + \frac{v_2}{c} \approx 1.00233 \) (since \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s} \)), we find:
\[
\lambda_{2, \text{emit}} \approx \lambda_{\text{obs}} \cdot 0.99767.
\]

The temperature of a star is inversely proportional to its emitted wavelength, so:
\[
T_2 = \frac{b}{\lambda_{2, \text{emit}}} \approx \frac{b}{\lambda_{\text{obs}} \cdot 0.99767} = \frac{T_1}{0.99767}.
\]

Thus:
\[
T_2 \approx T_1 \cdot 1.00233.
\]

### Step 3: Temperature Ratio in Luminosity
The temperature ratio raised to the fourth power is:
\[
\left( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \right)^4 = \left( \frac{1}{1.00233} \right)^4.
\]

Using the approximation \( (1.00233)^4 \approx 1.00936 \), we find:
\[
\left( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \right)^4 \approx \frac{1}{1.00936}.
\]

### Step 4: Luminosity Ratio
Substituting into the luminosity ratio formula:
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2}{R_2^2} \cdot \left( \frac{T_1^4}{T_2^4} \right) = 2.25 \cdot \frac{1}{1.00936}.
\]

Performing the division:
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} \approx \frac{2.25}{1.00936} \approx 2.229.
\]

### Final Answer:
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times greater than that of Star_2. Comparing this to the options, the closest match is:
