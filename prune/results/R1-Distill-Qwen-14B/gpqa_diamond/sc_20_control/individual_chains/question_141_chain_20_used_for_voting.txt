Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me think through it step by step. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. I need to figure out how many possible organic products there are.

First, I should recall what NaNH2 does in such reactions. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions. In the context of aromatic compounds, especially those with directing groups, it can lead to elimination or substitution reactions. Wait, but wait—what about when it's in an ammonia solvent? Oh right, that's a common condition for elimination, like the formation of alkenes from alkyl halides (the E2 mechanism), but this is aromatic, so maybe it's a different scenario.

The compound given is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Wait, what's that structure? I think the "d" might be a typo, but perhaps it's a deuterated compound. Oh wait, wait, 1-bromobenzene-2-d would be bromobenzene with a deuterium somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-deutero-benzene. So, the benzene ring has a bromine at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2. Wait, but benzene is symmetric, so perhaps the positions are adjacent? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the "d" refers to something else, but perhaps it's a typo and it's 1-bromobenzene-2-d, but maybe that's not the key point. Let me think: the main thing is that there's a bromine and a deuterium on adjacent carbons.

Wait, but the reaction is with NaNH2 in ammonia. I'm trying to remember—what kind of reaction occurs when an aromatic ring with a leaving group and a hydrogen (or deuterium) is treated with a strong base like NaNH2. Oh, perhaps it's a case of dehydrohalogenation, but wait, that's more common in aliphatic systems. Alternatively, maybe it's a case of elimination, forming a double bond, but in aromatic rings? Wait, benzene is already a conjugated system with delocalized electrons. Wait, perhaps the reaction is about removing a hydrogen adjacent to the bromine to form a benzene ring with a double bond, but that's not possible because benzene is already a ring of conjugated double bonds. Hmm, maybe I'm thinking in the wrong direction.

Wait, another thought: NaNH2 is a strong base, which can deprotonate compounds. If there's an acidic hydrogen adjacent to the bromine, it might abstract that proton, leading to elimination of HBr (or in this case, perhaps H2O or something else, but wait, the solvent is ammonia). Wait, but in this case, the hydrogen is deuterated—so perhaps the hydrogen is replaced by deuterium, so the acidity is different. Wait, but deuterium is less acidic than protium. Hmm, but wait—could the reaction involve removing a proton (not deuterium) adjacent to the bromine?

Wait, the structure is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. So the bromine is at position 1, and the deuterium is at position 2. So the positions are adjacent. So the ring has a Br at C1 and a D at C2. So when we treat this with NaNH2, which is a strong base, in ammonia.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, eliminating HBr. But wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so elimination would require adjacent H and Br. Oh wait, but in this case, Br is at C1, and the adjacent C2 has a D. So maybe the H at C2 is replaced by D, so the only H available adjacent to Br is perhaps at C6? Because in benzene, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons. So C1 is connected to C6 and C2. So if C2 has a D, then the adjacent H would be at C6. So maybe the base abstracts a proton from C6, leading to elimination of Br- and formation of a double bond between C1 and C6. But wait, benzene is already a ring of conjugated double bonds. So perhaps in this scenario, the base removes a proton, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, but wait, that's not possible because benzene is already a fully conjugated system. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, another angle: maybe the reaction is a substitution. Since NaNH2 is a strong base, perhaps it's a case of an aromatic SNAr (nucleophilic aromatic substitution). But for SNAr to occur, the ring must be activated towards nucleophilic attack, which typically requires electron-withdrawing groups. Bromine is an electron-withdrawing group via the inductive effect but is ortho/para directing. Wait, but SNAr usually happens when the leaving group is in a position that's activated by strong electron-withdrawing groups. Like nitro groups, for example. Wait, but here it's just bromine. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an elimination reaction forming a triple bond? Wait, that doesn't make sense for a benzene ring. Wait, maybe it's more about deprotonation leading to a benzene ring with a negative charge.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, but that's not possible because benzene already has a conjugated system. So maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a benzyne formation. Wait, benzyne is a triple bond in the benzene ring, but that's a very reactive species. But how is that formed? Usually, benzyne is formed by dehalogenation of a dihalobenzene with a strong base. For instance, 1,2-dihalobenzenes can lose two equivalents of HX (like HBr) to form benzyne.

Wait, in this case, the compound is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. So only bromine is present as a halogen. So perhaps that's not the case. Unless the deuterium is a mistake, and the actual compound is 1,2-dibromobenzene-d. Hmm, but the question says 1-bromobenzene-2-d, so probably only one bromine. So benzyne formation may not be possible here.

Wait, but perhaps the deuterium is not relevant, and the reaction is about the bromine. So perhaps the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the bromine, leading to the elimination of Br- and the formation of a double bond. But that would require that the Br is in a position where elimination can occur, but in benzene, all positions are sp² hybridized. So I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the bromide leaves, and ammonia acts as a nucleophile. But NaNH2 is a strong base, not a good nucleophile in such conditions. Plus, the solvent is ammonia, so maybe it's a deprotonation followed by substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from the ring, making a carbanion, which could then eliminate the bromide. But I'm not sure how that would proceed.

Wait, another approach: think about what NaNH2 does in other reactions. It's often used to deprotonate compounds to form strong bases, like in the formation of Grignard reagents or in elimination reactions. In the case of benzene rings, if there's a good leaving group and a hydrogen that can be abstracted, perhaps it's an E2 elimination.

But for E2, the hydrogen and the leaving group need to be antiperiplanar. So in the benzene ring, with Br at C1, the adjacent H would be at C2 or C6. But in this molecule, C2 has a D, so the H would be at C6. So the base abstracts the H from C6, and the Br leaves, forming a double bond between C1 and C6. But wait, benzene already has a delocalized double bond system, so adding another double bond isn't feasible. Hmm, perhaps the ring becomes more strained, or maybe it's a different mechanism.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but substitution. So perhaps the base abstracts a proton, leading to a resonance-stabilized carbanion, which then kicks out Br- as a leaving group. But for that to happen, the leaving group needs to be activated, which bromine is not as good as in the case of nitro groups.

Alternatively, maybe the base is causing a dehydrohalogenation to form a triple bond, but that doesn't make sense in this context.

Wait, another thought: in aromatic chemistry, sometimes when you have a halogen and a hydrogen on adjacent carbons, and you treat with a strong base, you can form an aromatic ring with a double bond. But I'm not quite getting it.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a benzene ring with a bromine and a deuterium and upon treatment with NaNH2, the base abstracts a proton (not the deuterium) leading to elimination of Br- and formation of a triple bond, making benzyne. But wait, for benzyne formation, you typically need two halogens on adjacent carbons. For example, 1,2-dibromobenzene treated with a strong base like NaNH2 in NH3 would lose two equivalents of HBr to form a triple bond (benzyne).

But in this problem, the compound is 1-bromobenzene-2-d, which has only one bromine and a deuterium on the adjacent position. So maybe the base abstracts a proton from a position that's not adjacent to the bromine, but that doesn't make sense for elimination.

Wait, perhaps the base isn't acting on the aromatic ring but on a substituent. But in this case, the substituent is just Br and D, so perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, could this be a case where the base abstracts a hydrogen from the ring, making a carbanion which then loses Br- to form a benzene ring with a negative charge? But I don't think that's a common reaction, and I'm not sure how that would proceed.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could be a substitution where the bromine is replaced by something else. But what's the nucleophile here? NaNH2 in ammonia is a strong base, but perhaps the ammonia acts as a nucleophile. So perhaps the bromide leaves, and ammonia attacks the ring, replacing Br with NH2-. But wait, that would be a nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr), which usually requires a strongly activated ring with a good leaving group. Bromine isn't a great leaving group for SNAr unless the ring is strongly activated. But bromobenzene itself isn't activated enough for SNAr under normal conditions. So that's probably not happening here.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about what product(s) could form when a bromobenzene derivative is treated with a strong base like NaNH2 in ammonia.

Wait, another angle: perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination scenario, but that's more about aliphatic amines. Or maybe it's a case of forming an aryl Grignard reagent, but I don't think Grignard reagents form from benzene rings easily.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond. But that's not possible because benzene already has all double bonds. So maybe it's more about a ring contraction or expansion, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the deuterium is a red herring, and the reaction is about the bromine. So perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the bromine is replaced by a group from the solvent or base. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is about removing the bromine. If the base abstracts a proton adjacent to Br, then the Br could leave, forming a ring contraction. Wait, but I'm not sure about that.

Wait, another thought: in some cases, when a benzene ring has a bromine and a hydrogen on adjacent carbons, treatment with a strong base can lead to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond in a different position. But I'm not exactly recalling the specifics.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a simple elimination, but considering the aromatic ring, the product would be a diene or something similar, but that doesn't fit with benzene's structure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't about the ring itself but about any substituents. But in this case, the substituents are Br and D, which aren't leaving groups except Br.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a single elimination, but then what would be the product? If the Br leaves along with a proton, forming a triple bond. But without another halogen, that can't form benzyne.

Hmm. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about what NaNH2 does in other contexts. For example, in the Birch reduction, NaNH2 is used to reduce aromatic rings, but that's in a different solvent.

Wait, another possibility: the base abstracts a proton para to the bromine, leading to some rearrangement. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Fittig reaction, but that requires two aryl halides and forms a biaryl compound, which doesn't fit here because there's only one bromine.

Wait, perhaps this is a case of elimination where the Br and a proton are removed, forming a triple bond (benzyne). But as I thought earlier, that requires two adjacent halogens. Since this compound only has one Br and a D on adjacent carbon, perhaps the D is not a halogen. Wait, wait a minute—maybe the D is a hydrogen isotope, so it's still a hydrogen. So if the Br is at C1, and a hydrogen (as D) is at C2, then perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from C6 (the other adjacent position to C1), leading to elimination of HBr and formation of a triple bond between C1 and C2. But wait, that would require that both C1 and C2 have halogens or something else to eliminate. No, wait, in benzyne formation, you need two halogens on adjacent carbons. So without a second halogen, you can't form benzyne. So this reaction might not proceed to form benzyne.

So, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed as I was thinking. Maybe I'm missing something about the structure. Wait, the compound is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. So, benzene ring with Br at position 1, and D at position 2. So, that's adjacent. So, the positions are 1 and 2, which are adjacent. So, the Br and D are on adjacent carbons.

Wait, another thought: maybe the base abstracts the deuterium, but D is not as acidic as H, so that's less likely. Or perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from another position, leading to some substitution.

Wait, but if the base abstracts a hydrogen from a position that's meta or para to the Br, what happens? Maybe that creates a ring where the Br is in a position to leave, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Sandmeyer-type reaction, but that's usually for converting halides to other groups using a metal catalyst, which isn't the case here.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to think about possible products. If the reaction involves elimination of HBr, perhaps we'd get a benzene ring with a triple bond, but as discussed earlier, that's only possible with two adjacent halogens. So without another halogen, that's not feasible.

Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a hydrogen adjacent to Br, leading to a benzene ring with a double bond, but that doesn't make sense because benzene is already a conjugated system.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't involve elimination but substitution. For example, the Br is replaced by something else. But what's the nucleophile here? If ammonia is present, maybe NH2- could attack. But in SNAr, the ring needs to be activated. Bromobenzene isn't activated enough for SNAr unless there's a strong electron-withdrawing group, which isn't present here. So substitution via SNAr is unlikely.

Hmm. Maybe the reaction is a simple dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not seeing the product.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is forming a benzene ring with a missing hydrogen and a negative charge, like a carbanion. But that's a high-energy species and would likely lead to some rearrangement.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a lone pair on the carbon where the Br was, turning it into a carbanion. Then, perhaps that could lead to some rearrangement or attack by ammonia. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a hydrogen from the ring, forming a carbanion, and the Br- leaves, leading to a benzene ring with a negative charge. But I'm not sure how that would proceed.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't form any new bonds but just deprotonates the compound. But in that case, there's only one deprotonation possible, so the number of products would be one. But then, what about the solvent and the conditions? Or perhaps the deprotonation leads to a carbanion that's resonance-stabilized, but that's only one product.

Wait, but the question is about possible organic products. If the reaction doesn't proceed, then no products form, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed as I thought, and the product is the same as the starting material. But that would mean no new products, which isn't an option either.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction. But without another aryl halide, that's unlikely.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a case of aromatic ring expansion or contraction, but I'm not sure how that would happen with NaNH2.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is about the ring becoming more reactive, like forming a naphthalene structure, but I don't see how that would happen.

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a negative charge, which could then react further. But without another reagent, I'm not sure what would happen.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a simple elimination, but I'm not seeing the product.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible products. If the base abstracts a hydrogen adjacent to Br, which is at C1, then the Br would leave, and a double bond would form between C1 and C2. But since the ring is already conjugated, that's not possible, so perhaps that doesn't happen. Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a hydrogen from C6, leading to a double bond between C1 and C6, but again, the ring's structure doesn't allow that.

Wait, maybe the reaction doesn't proceed, and the only product is the starting material. But the options don't include zero, so that can't be.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Let me think again about the reaction conditions. NaNH2 in condensed ammonia is a strong base, often used for dehydrohalogenation. But in aromatic systems, this might not work as expected.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a case of forming a benzene ring with a nitro group or some other substituent, but I don't see the reagent for that.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a coupling between two benzene rings, but again, that's not applicable here.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a simple deprotonation, leading to a carbanion, but that's only one product.

Wait, but the starting material has D at position 2. So if the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 3, for example, could that lead to some rearrangement? Or maybe the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 4, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a case of ortho elimination. So the Br at C1 and a hydrogen at C2 (but wait, it's D there) are removed, leading to the formation of a triple bond between C1 and C2. But as D is not a halogen, perhaps that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a hydrogen from C3 or C6, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't form any new bonds and just deprotonates the compound. But since the compound is 1-bromobenzene-2-d, the only acidic protons would be those that are most susceptible, like those ortho to the bromine. So in this case, the H at C6 would be ortho to Br, making it more acidic. So the base (NaNH2) would abstract that proton, leading to a carbanion at C6. Then, perhaps the Br- leaves, but that would require a good leaving group, which Br is, but in an aromatic ring, leaving groups usually don't leave unless there's a strong activation.

Alternatively, perhaps the abstraction of the H leads to a resonance-stabilized carbanion, which could then leave, but that's not typical for benzene rings.

Wait, but if the Br leaves after the proton is abstracted, then what's left would be a benzene ring with a negative charge at C6 and a missing Br at C1. But that's not a stable structure, so perhaps some rearrangement occurs.

Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a proton, and the Br- leaves, leading to the formation of a new double bond. But again, benzene's structure doesn't allow that.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the possible number of products. The options are 1, 2, 3, or 4. If the reaction only produces one product, then the answer would be B) 1. But I'm not confident.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the reaction leads to more than one product because the base can abstract protons from different positions. For example, if the base can abstract a proton from two different positions, leading to two different products.

Wait, but in this case, the Br is at C1, and the only adjacent H is at C6 (since C2 has D). So the base could abstract H from C6, leading to elimination of Br and formation of a benzene ring with a double bond between C1 and C6. But that's not possible because benzene already has a conjugated system.

Wait, perhaps the elimination leads to a different structure, like a naphthalene-like system, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from C3, which is meta to Br, but that's less acidic than the ortho positions. So maybe the base abstracts H from C6, the ortho position, leading to a carbanion at C6. Then, the Br leaves, and perhaps the ring becomes a diradical or something else. But I'm not familiar with such a reaction.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, and the only product is the starting material. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of two different products due to the possibility of resonance or different elimination pathways. But I'm not seeing it.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is not about the aromatic ring but about any substituents. But in this case, the substituents are Br and D, so that's unlikely.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Let me try to think of this differently. What if the reaction is a substitution where the Br is replaced by another group. But what's the nucleophile here? Maybe ammonia acts as a nucleophile, replacing Br with NH2-. But that would require an SNAr mechanism, which needs a strongly activated ring. Bromobenzene isn't activated enough for that, so substitution isn't likely.

Wait, but if the base abstracts a proton, creating a ring that's more activated towards substitution, perhaps the Br could leave, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a simple elimination, but I don't see how that would form a new product.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, and there's only the starting material as the product. But again, that's not an option.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Maybe I should look for similar reactions. Oh, wait! I remember that when a benzene ring has a bromine and a hydrogen on adjacent carbons, treatment with a strong base like NaNH2 in ammonia can lead to the formation of an aromatic ring with a triple bond—benzyne. But for benzyne formation, you need two halogens on adjacent carbons. Since here, only one Br is present, that's not possible. Therefore, the reaction might not proceed, but the starting material is the only product. But again, that's not an option.

Wait, but maybe the D in the compound is not relevant, and the reaction is about the Br and another H. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a deuterium and Br in a different position. But that's not likely, as the base is abstracting protons, not deuterium.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to the substitution of Br with a deuterium. But that doesn't make much sense, as D is not a strong base.

Hmm. I'm going around in circles. Let me try to summarize what I know:

- Reagent: NaNH2 in ammonia (strong base)
- Compound: 1-bromobenzene-2-d (Br at C1, D at C2)
- Possible reactions: elimination, substitution, deprotonation

If the reaction is elimination (E2), but without two adjacent halogens, it can't form benzyne. So elimination isn't possible.

If it's substitution, but SNAr isn't feasible without an activating group. So substitution isn't likely.

Deprotonation: The base could abstract a proton adjacent to Br (C6), leading to a carbanion. Then, what? The Br could leave, but that would create a negative charge and a hole in the ring, which isn't feasible. So perhaps the only product is the starting material.

Wait, but the reaction isn't proceeding, so no products. But the options don't have zero, so that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a simple deprotonation, leading to a carbanion. But that's only one product.

Wait, the starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. If the base abstracts H from C6 (ortho to Br), then the product would be a benzene ring with Br at C1 and a negative charge at C6. But that's not a stable product, so perhaps it's not formed. Or maybe it's a resonance-stabilized species, but that wouldn't count as a separate product; it's just an intermediate.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Perhaps the correct answer is that only one product is formed, so option B) 1. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, but since that's not an option, I'll have to go with the deprotonation leading to one product.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia solvent. NaNH₂ is a strong base, commonly used for deprotonation or elimination reactions. The compound 1-bromobenzene-2-d consists of a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom at position 2. The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Reaction Conditions and NaNH₂ Behavior**: NaNH₂ is a strong base that can abstract protons (or deuterium) from acidic positions. In aromatic systems, it typically targets protons ortho or para to electron-withdrawing groups like bromine.

2. **Structure of 1-bromobenzene-2-d**: The bromine is at position 1, and the deuterium is at position 2. This makes the adjacent position (C6) ortho to the bromine, which is expected to have an acidic proton due to the electron-withdrawing inductive effect of bromine.

3. **Possible Reactions**:
   - **Elimination (E2 Mechanism)**: For elimination to occur, there must be a proton and a leaving group (Br) on adjacent carbons. However, the deuterium at position 2 is not a leaving group, and the reaction conditions do not support the formation of benzyne (which requires two adjacent halogens). Thus, elimination is not feasible.
   - **Substitution (SNAr Mechanism)**: Nucleophilic aromatic substitution typically requires a strongly activated ring with a good leaving group. Bromobenzene is not sufficiently activated for SNAr under these conditions.
   - **Deprotonation**: The base can abstract the acidic proton at position 6 (ortho to bromine), forming a resonance-stabilized carbanion. However, this intermediate is not a stable product under the given conditions.

4. **Outcome**: The reaction does not proceed to form new stable products. The starting material remains unchanged, and no additional organic products are formed.

Given the analysis, the reaction does not produce any new organic products. Therefore, the number of possible organic products is **1** (the starting material itself).

Answer: B
