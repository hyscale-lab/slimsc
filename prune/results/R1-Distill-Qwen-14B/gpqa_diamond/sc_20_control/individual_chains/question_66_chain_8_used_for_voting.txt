Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I need to figure out which symmetries all operators must respect. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetry. The choices are A to D, each combining different symmetries.

Wait, I remember that SMEFT is built by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model. These operators must respect the gauge symmetries of the SM, which include SU(3), SU(2), and U(1)Y. But the question is about other symmetries, like Lorentz and Poincare.

Lorentz symmetry is about the invariance under Lorentz transformations, which include rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry combines Lorentz symmetry with translations, so it includes momentum conservation. So if an operator respects Lorentz symmetry, it should also respect Poincare, right? Because Poincare is a bigger symmetry group.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Are all operators in SMEFT automatically Poincare invariant? Because SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory. So the operators must respect Lorentz symmetry, which would imply they respect Poincare as well. So if that's the case, then options that include both 1 and 2, like option A which is 1 and 2, or option C which includes 1,2,4.

Then there's CP symmetry, which is charge conjugation combined with parity. And CPT symmetry, which combines C, P, and T. But wait, the SMEFT doesn't necessarily have to respect these unless the SM itself does. The SM isn't CP symmetric (like in the CKM problem), but it does respect CPT. Wait, does SMEFT require operators to respect CP? Or is it that the SM doesn't require CP, so SMEFT operators don't have to either?

Wait, the question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. I think SMEFT operators must respect gauge symmetries, Lorentz, and CPT. But I'm not certain about the others.

Wait, the Standard Model is CPT symmetric, so any effective theory should also respect CPT. Because CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory, especially for theories that are Lorentz invariant. So SMEFT, being a Lorentz-invariant effective theory, should respect CPT symmetry.

What about CP? The SM doesn't have CP symmetry, so operators in SMEFT don't need to respect that. So if a question asks which must be respected, CP symmetry (option 3) isn't necessarily one. So any option that includes 3 (like B, D) is less likely. But let me think again.

Wait, the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. So operators can violate CP, but must they respect CPT? Since SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, I think CPT is automatically respected because in QFT, Lorentz invariance implies CPT conservation. So any operator in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry. So option 4 is correct.

So putting it all together, which symmetries must be respected?

1. Lorentz Symmetry: Yes, because SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory.
2. Poincare Symmetry: Since Lorentz is a subset, and SMEFT respects Lorentz, it should also respect Poincare. So yes.
3. CP Symmetry: No, because the SM doesn't have CP symmetry, and SMEFT doesn't require operators to preserve it.
4. CPT Symmetry: Yes, because it's tied to Lorentz invariance.

So the correct symmetries are 1, 2, and 4. Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. So the answer would be C.

Wait, but wait a second. Poincare symmetry is more than just Lorentz; it includes translations as well. So an operator must be invariant under both Lorentz transformations and translations. But in SMEFT, because it's a Lorentz-invariant theory, all operators are automatically Poincare-invariant. Because the theory is built as such.

So the correct answer includes 1, 2, and 4. So the options are:

Options:
A) 1,2
B)3,4
C)1,2,4
D)1,3,4

So the correct answer is C.

To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we analyze the symmetries provided:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, meaning all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. This includes invariance under rotations and boosts.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry combines Lorentz symmetry with translation symmetry. Since SMEFT is Lorentz-invariant and built as a field theory, it is also Poincaré-invariant. Therefore, operators in SMEFT must respect Poincaré symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model (SM) does not respect CP symmetry (e.g., due to the CKM problem). Consequently, SMEFT operators are not required to preserve CP symmetry.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry is a fundamental property of quantum field theories, particularly those that are Lorentz-invariant. Since SMEFT is Lorentz-invariant, it must respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). CP symmetry (3) is not necessarily respected. Among the given options, the correct choice is:

**C) 1, 2, 4**
