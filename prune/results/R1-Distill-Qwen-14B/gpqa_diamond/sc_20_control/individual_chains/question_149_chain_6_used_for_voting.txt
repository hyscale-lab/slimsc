Okay, so I have this NMR and LC-MS question in front of me, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question says that a small peptidic compound was chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR of the crude compound looks mostly like what's expected, except for two peaks from the same alpha-proton. Both peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H, so that part makes sense. Also, coupling isn't the issue because the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. 

Then, looking at the LC-MS analysis done at elevated temperature, there are two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass spectrum matching the expected molecule. So same mass, but two peaks. Hmm, what could that mean?

Let me think about NMR first. The duplicate alpha-proton peaks. Since the integrals add up to 1H, it suggests that each peak is 0.5H? Wait, no, because two peaks each might have integral around 0.5 each, adding to 1H. But why would that happen? Spin-spin coupling usually causes splitting into multiple peaks, but the question says they ruled that out. So it's not coupling. What else could cause two peaks from the same proton?

Wait, maybe it's not the same proton? No, the question says both correspond to the same alpha-proton. So same proton, but two peaks with similar shifts. Hmm. Other possibilities: maybe there's some kind of exchange happening? Or perhaps the molecule is in a dynamic process, like a tautomerism, but that's more about protons in different environments.

Wait, another thought: if the compound is a racemic mixture, that would lead to diastereomers or enantiomers. Let me think about that. Enantiomers would have the same NMR because they are mirror images, so in a racemic mix, you wouldn't see separate peaks in 1H NMR because they are identical. But wait, wait. No, actually, enantiomers would have identical 1H NMR spectra, so you wouldn't see two separate signals. But diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR would show different peaks.

Wait, but the LC-MS shows two peaks with the same molecular mass. So same molecular weight, but different structures? But same mass spectrum. Wait, if it's diastereomers, their mass would be the same, but their retention times in LC might be different. So in LC, you could see two peaks, each with same mass. But in 1H NMR, you would see different peaks because the structures are different. But the question says that the NMR is consistent except for these two alpha protons. So why are there two peaks for the same alpha H?

Alternatively, what if the molecule has a double bond in a certain configuration, leading to some kind of coupling? Wait, but the question says spin-spin coupling is ruled out.

Another angle: looking at the options. Let's see the options.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. Well, a precursor would have a different molecular weight, right? Because it's the starting material. But the LC-MS shows same mass, so maybe not. Unless the precursor is at a similar mass? Unlikely, unless it's a fragment. But if it's a precursor, its mass would be higher than the product. So if the product is at m/z X, the precursor would be at X plus the mass of something, like another amino acid or group. So the MS would show a different mass. But the question says both peaks have the same mass as expected, so that probably rules out A.

Option B: Enantiomers. If the compound is a racemic mixture, but then the NMR wouldn't show two separate peaks for the same proton because enantiomers have identical NMR. So the NMR wouldn't show any splitting for the same proton. Thus, B might not fit, unless there's something else. Wait, but the question says the peaks are from the same alpha-proton. If it's a racemic mix, each enantiomer would have the same alpha proton environment, so the NMR would show a single peak. So B doesn't explain the two peaks. So maybe B is not the right choice.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide-bond formation. Hmm, what's 'double coupling'? Maybe when forming an amide, sometimes you can get some side products, like if two bonds form in a way that leads to some coupling that wasn't intended. But I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's about the formation of a double bond, which could cause coupling. Wait, but the question says it's ruled out because of coupling pattern. So C might not be the answer.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties. So in NMR, each diastereomer would have its own set of peaks. If there are two diastereomers in equal amounts, each would contribute their own peaks. But wait, the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha proton. So each diastereomer would have a different environment for that alpha proton. So each would have their own peak, but in the NMR, the two would overlap? Or perhaps they split each other's peaks. No, wait, if two diastereomers are present, each would have their own distinct NMR signals. So if there are two isomers, the same alpha proton would appear as two separate peaks. So that fits the NMR observation: two peaks for the same proton, same integral. And in LC-MS, since they are diastereomers, they would have the same molecular weight (same mass) but different retention times, so two peaks in LC. The same mass spectrum because theyâ€™re the same molecular formula, just different stereochemistry. So this seems to fit.

Wait, but let me think again. For diastereomers, the NMR would show different shifts for the same proton in each isomer. So in the NMR, each diastereomer contributes a peak for that proton. So if you have a 50:50 mix, you'd see two peaks, each integrating to 0.5H, adding up to 1H. Exactly what the question describes. And the LC-MS would show two peaks because the diastereomers have different retention times but same mass. So yes, D seems to fit.

But wait, what about enantiomers? If the compound is a racemic mixture, the NMR would not show two peaks. Because enantiomers have identical NMR signals. So the NMR would show a single peak for that alpha proton, but in reality, each enantiomer would contribute to the same peak. So B can't explain the NMR, because the peaks would not split. So D is the better option.

So the most likely explanation is that the compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers. So the answer should be D.

The question involves analyzing a small peptidic compound where the 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks corresponding to the same alpha-proton, and the LC-MS analysis reveals two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass spectrum. The goal is to determine the most likely explanation for these observations.

### Key Observations and Analysis:
1. **1H NMR Spectrum**:
   - Two peaks for the same alpha-proton are observed, with similar chemical shifts and integrals adding up to 1H.
   - Spin-spin coupling is ruled out as the cause of the duplicate peaks.

2. **LC-MS Analysis**:
   - Two peaks of equal intensity are observed, with the same mass spectrum consistent with the expected molecule.

3. **Elimination of Options**:
   - **Option A (Contaminated with a precursor)**: A precursor would have a different molecular weight, which contradicts the observation that both peaks have the same mass spectrum. This option is ruled out.
   - **Option B (Racemic mixture of enantiomers)**: Enantiomers have identical NMR spectra because they are mirror images. Thus, a racemic mixture would not result in two separate peaks for the same proton in the NMR spectrum. This option is ruled out.
   - **Option C ('Double coupling' during amide-bond formation)**: The question explicitly rules out spin-spin coupling as the cause of the duplicate peaks, making this explanation unlikely.

4. **Option D (Mixture of diastereoisomers)**:
   - Diastereoisomers have different physical and chemical environments, leading to distinct NMR signals. In a 50:50 mixture of two diastereoisomers, each would contribute a separate peak for the same alpha-proton, resulting in two peaks with similar shifts and integrals adding up to 1H. This matches the NMR observations.
   - In LC-MS, diastereoisomers would have the same molecular weight but different retention times, leading to two peaks of equal intensity. This also aligns with the LC-MS data.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers, which accounts for both the NMR and LC-MS observations.
