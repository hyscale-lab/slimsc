Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about atomic nuclei and fission. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it.

So the problem says: An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of their rest masses. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. We need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

The options are A to D with 2, 5, 10, 20 MeV. So the answer is the difference between the relativistic and classical T1.

Wait, I need to figure out both the relativistic and classical calculations and then find their difference.

Let me start by jotting down the given data:

- Initial nucleus: mass M, rest energy 300 GeV.
- After fission: two fragments, one twice as massive as the other. Let's call their masses m1 and m2, with m1 = 2 m2.
- Sum of rest masses: m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

So, let's find m1 and m2.

Since m1 = 2 m2, substituting into the sum:

2 m2 + m2 = 3 m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = (0.99 M) / 3 = 0.33 M.

Then m1 = 2 * 0.33 M = 0.66 M.

Wait, that adds up to 0.99 M, which matches the given condition. So that's correct.

Now, the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum before fission is zero. After fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions so that their momenta cancel out. So the momentum of m1 equals the momentum of m2 in magnitude but opposite in direction.

But wait, momentum is mass times velocity. So, m1 v1 = m2 v2 (in magnitude, opposite directions). Since m1 = 2 m2, this implies that v1 = (m2/m1) v2 = (1/2) v2. But wait, that's for velocity. Hmm, but perhaps it's better to think in terms of their speeds. Alternatively, perhaps using energy conservation.

Wait, but when the nucleus splits, some mass is converted into kinetic energy, right? Because the sum of the rest masses is less than the original. So the initial rest energy is 300 GeV, but the rest energy after is 0.99 M c². Wait, but M is the initial mass, so its rest energy is 300 GeV. Then the sum of rest energies after is 0.99 M c², which would be 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. But wait, that can't be right because the initial rest energy is 300 GeV, and after fission, the rest energy is 297 GeV, implying that 3 GeV is converted into kinetic energy. But wait, that's only the rest mass part. Wait, no, actually, the kinetic energy would come from the mass defect. The mass before is M, and after is 0.99 M, so mass defect is 0.01 M. So the energy released is (0.01 M c²) = 0.01 * 300 GeV = 3 GeV. So that's the total energy available, which includes the kinetic energies of both fragments plus any other forms (but the problem says nothing else, so I'll assume it's all kinetic energy).

Wait, but wait. Because in reality, the rest mass of the products would be less than the original, so the difference is the energy released, which goes into kinetic energy. So yes, the total kinetic energy (K) of the two fragments is 3 GeV.

But wait, that's the total energy. So K1 + K2 = 3 GeV.

But wait, in the rest frame of the initial nucleus, the total momentum is zero. So the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. So momentum of m1 is p, momentum of m2 is -p. So p = m1 v1 = m2 v2 (in magnitude). So m1 v1 = m2 v2 → (2 m2) v1 = m2 v2 → 2 v1 = v2. Since m1 is 2 m2, so velocity of m2 is twice that of m1.

But since kinetic energy depends on velocity squared, the kinetic energies will be in proportion to (v1)^2 and (v2)^2 times masses. Hmm.

But perhaps it's better to approach this using energy and momentum conservation.

Let me denote the velocities as v1 and v2 for the two fragments. The momentum conservation gives:

m1 v1 = m2 v2.

Since m1 = 2 m2,

2 m2 v1 = m2 v2 → 2 v1 = v2.

So v2 = 2 v1.

Now, the kinetic energies are:

K1 = (1/2) m1 v1²,

K2 = (1/2) m2 v2².

Substituting m1 = 2 m2 and v2 = 2 v1,

K1 = (1/2) (2 m2) v1² = m2 v1²,

K2 = (1/2) m2 (2 v1)^2 = (1/2) m2 *4 v1² = 2 m2 v1².

So K1 + K2 = 3 GeV → m2 v1² + 2 m2 v1² = 3 m2 v1² = 3 GeV → m2 v1² = 1 GeV.

But K1 is m2 v1², so K1 = 1 GeV, K2 = 2 GeV. So the more massive fragment (m1) has K1 = 1 GeV. So according to the classical (non-relativistic) approach, T1 is 1 GeV.

Wait, but wait, that's the classical approximation. But the question is about the difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 and the classical T1. So maybe in reality, the kinetic energy is not just 1 GeV but more because of relativistic effects.

Wait, but I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me think about the relativistic approach.

In the relativistic case, the energy of each fragment is the sum of their rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But wait, the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total energy is M c² = 300 GeV. After fission, each fragment has energy E1 and E2, with E1 = (m1 c²) γ and E2 = (m2 c²) γ', where γ is the Lorentz factor for each fragment. Also, the total energy must be 300 GeV, so E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

But wait, the rest masses of the fragments sum to 0.99 M c² = 297 GeV. So the sum of their rest energies is 297 GeV. So the sum of their kinetic energies is 3 GeV, as before.

But in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (γ-1) m c².

So for fragment 1 (mass m1 = 0.66 M):

E1 = (0.66 M c²) γ1,

E2 = (0.33 M c²) γ2.

And E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

But we also have momentum conservation. Since the initial momentum is zero, the momentum of fragment 1 equals the negative of fragment 2.

The momentum P1 = m1 γ1 v1,

P2 = m2 γ2 v2.

So, m1 γ1 v1 = m2 γ2 v2.

Hmm, but this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that the fragments' momenta are equal and opposite, so their velocities are related. 

But maybe there's a simpler approach. Let's consider that the kinetic energy in the relativistic case is higher because of the γ factor.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The problem asks for the difference between the correct T1 and the classical T1. So let's first compute the classical T1, which I thought was 1 GeV.

Wait, but wait a second. That can't be right. Because in the classical case, the kinetic energy is all the 3 GeV, but no, the sum of the two K's is 3 GeV. But from the earlier calculation, K1 (more massive) is 1 GeV and K2 is 2 GeV, adding to 3 GeV. So the classical calculation gives T1 = 1 GeV.

But the relativistic calculation would give a higher T1 because, in relativity, as the fragment moves at a significant fraction of c, its kinetic energy is higher than the classical calculation.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

In the classical case, the kinetic energies are K1=1 GeV, K2=2 GeV.

But in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy would be higher. Because the mass is moving at a speed where relativistic effects are significant.

Wait, but let me think about the energy.

The initial energy is 300 GeV. The sum of the rest mass energies is 297 GeV, so the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV, same as before. But in reality, the kinetic energy is higher because of the way γ factors work.

Wait, no, no. Wait, no, the total kinetic energy in the system must come from the mass defect. So the initial rest energy is 300 GeV. After fission, the rest energy is 297 GeV. So the total energy released as kinetic is 3 GeV. So E1 + E2 = 300 GeV, where E1 and E2 are the energies of each fragment, which includes both rest mass and kinetic energy.

But the rest mass energies are 297 GeV (sum of m1 c² and m2 c²), so E1 + E2 = 300 GeV. So the sum of their kinetic energies is 3 GeV.

But when using classical mechanics, we allocate K1=1 GeV and K2=2 GeV.

In the relativistic case, perhaps the more massive fragment's kinetic energy is less than 1 GeV? Or more? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, wait, perhaps it's better to approach this using energy and momentum equations.

Let me denote:

m1 = 0.66 M,

m2 = 0.33 M.

Total rest energy of the two fragments: (m1 + m2) c² = 0.99 M c² = 297 GeV.

The initial energy is 300 GeV, so the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV.

Now, let me write the conservation of energy and momentum.

Energy:

E1 + E2 = 300 GeV,

Momentum:

p1 = p2, but opposite directions, so p1 = -p2.

So, p1 = (m1 γ1) v1,

p2 = (m2 γ2) v2.

But since p1 = - p2,

m1 γ1 v1 = m2 γ2 v2.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe I can relate v1 and v2 using this.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that in the center-of-momentum frame, the velocities are opposite. Hmm.

But maybe a better approach is to use the relation between energy and momentum for each particle.

For each fragment, E^2 = (pc c)^2 + (m c^2)^2.

So, E1^2 = (p c)^2 + (m1 c^2)^2,

E2^2 = (p c)^2 + (m2 c^2)^2.

Wait, because |p1| = |p2| = p. Because they are moving in opposite directions, but same magnitude.

So E1 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m1 c^2)^2 )

E2 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m2 c^2)^2 )

And E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

That's two equations with two variables (p and E1, E2). But it's a bit complicated to solve.

Let me denote x = p c.

Then,

E1 = sqrt(x² + (m1 c²)^2 )

E2 = sqrt(x² + (m2 c²)^2 )

E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

But m1 c² = 0.66 M c²,

m2 c² = 0.33 M c².

But M c² is 300 GeV. So,

m1 c² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV,

m2 c² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV.

So,

E1 = sqrt(x² + (198)^2 ),

E2 = sqrt(x² + (99)^2 ).

And E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

Hmm, that's a tough equation to solve. Maybe I can approximate it numerically.

Let me denote E1 = sqrt(x² + 198²),

E2 = sqrt(x² + 99²).

So,

sqrt(x² + 198²) + sqrt(x² + 99²) = 300.

This seems tricky. Maybe I can make an initial approximation. Let's assume that x is much smaller than 198 and 99, but wait, with a total sum of 300, maybe x is not negligible. Let me try to find x.

Alternatively, perhaps I can square both sides to eliminate one square root.

Let me write S = sqrt(x² + 198²) + sqrt(x² + 99²) = 300.

Let me denote A = sqrt(x² + 198²), B = sqrt(x² + 99²).

Then, A + B = 300.

Also, A^2 = x² + 198²,

B^2 = x^2 + 99².

Subtracting the two:

A^2 - B^2 = (198)^2 - (99)^2 = (198 -99)(198+99) = (99)(297) = 29403.

But A^2 - B^2 = (A - B)(A + B) = (A - B) * 300 = 29403.

So,

300 (A - B) = 29403 → (A - B) = 29403 / 300 ≈ 98.01 GeV.

So,

A + B = 300,

A - B ≈ 98.01,

Adding these two equations:

2A = 398.01 → A ≈ 199.005 GeV.

Then B ≈ 300 - 199.005 ≈ 100.995 GeV.

Now, from A = sqrt(x² + 198²) = 199.005,

So,

x² + 198^2 = (199.005)^2,

x² = (199.005)^2 - (198)^2.

Calculating that,

(199.005)^2 = (200 - 0.995)^2 ≈ 200^2 - 2*200*0.995 + (0.995)^2 → 40000 - 398 + ~1 ≈ 39603.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately:

199.005^2 = (200 - 0.995)^2 = 200^2 - 2*200*0.995 + (0.995)^2 =40000 - 398 + 0.990025 ≈ 40000 - 398 = 39602 + 0.990025 ≈ 39602.990025.

198^2 = 39204.

So x² = 39602.990025 - 39204 = 398.990025 → x ≈ sqrt(398.99) ≈ 19.9747 GeV.

So x ≈ 20 GeV.

Now, let's compute B:

B = sqrt( x² + 99^2 ) = sqrt( (398.99) + 9801 ) = sqrt( 398.99 + 9801 ) = sqrt(10200 approximately).

Wait, 10200 is 100^2=10000, 101^2=10201. So sqrt(10200) ≈ 100.995, which matches our earlier value.

So now, we have x ≈ 19.9747 GeV.

Now, the velocity can be found using p = gamma m v,

where p is the momentum, which is x = p c → p = x/(c). Wait, earlier I defined x = p c, so p = x / c.

But in terms of gamma and velocity,

p = gamma m v,

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²),

So,

gamma m v c = x → v = x/(gamma m c).

But perhaps it's easier to compute beta (v/c) as beta = v/c.

Since p = gamma m beta,

and we have p = x / c,

so,

gamma m beta = x / c,

→ gamma beta = x/(c m).

But m is in units where c=1? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Alternatively, let me compute beta for each fragment.

Wait, we have p = gamma m beta.

So, for fragment 1,

p = gamma1 m1 beta1 = x/(c).

But m1 is 0.66 M, but M c² is 300 GeV, so m1 c² = 198 GeV.

So m1 = 198 GeV / c².

Similarly, for fragment 1,

gamma1 m1 beta1 c = x → gamma1 (198 GeV / c²) beta1 c = x.

gamma1 beta1 = x c / (198 GeV) → but x is in GeV units, because x = p c, p has units GeV/c, so x c is GeV.

So,

gamma1 beta1 = (19.9747 GeV) c / (198 GeV) ) → wait, wait, the units may not be correct. Hmm, perhaps it's better to work in units where c=1, so x is in GeV (as p c).

Wait, perhaps I should proceed differently. Let's compute beta1 for fragment 1.

We have,

gamma1 = E1/(m1 c²) = 199.005 GeV / 198 GeV ≈ 1.00507565.

So,

gamma1 ≈ 1.00507565.

Then,

gamma1^2 = (1.00507565)^2 ≈ 1.010176,

and,

gamma1^2 = 1/(1 - beta1^2) → 1 - beta1^2 = 1/1.010176 ≈ 0.99006 → beta1^2 ≈ 0.00994 → beta1 ≈ sqrt(0.00994) ≈ 0.0997, so about 0.0997c.

Similarly, for fragment 2,

E2 = 100.995 GeV,

m2 c² = 99 GeV,

gamma2 = E2/(m2 c²) = 100.995 / 99 ≈ 1.0201515.

Then,

gamma2 ≈ 1.02015,

gamma2^2 ≈ 1.04067,

1 - beta2^2 = 1/(gamma2^2) → 1/1.04067 ≈ 0.9614 → beta2^2 ≈ 0.0386 → beta2 ≈ 0.1964 → about 0.1964c.

So the velocities are approximately 0.0997c and 0.1964c, respectively.

Now, the kinetic energy in the relativistic case is (gamma -1) m c².

So for fragment 1,

K1 = (gamma1 -1) m1 c².

gamma1 is approximately 1.00507565,

so gamma1 -1 ≈ 0.00507565.

m1 c² is 198 GeV,

so K1 ≈ 0.00507565 * 198 GeV ≈ 1.00507565 GeV.

Wait, that's about 1.005 GeV.

In the classical case, K1 was 1 GeV.

So the relativistic K1 is about 1.005 GeV, so the difference would be about 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.

Wait, because 1 GeV is 1000 MeV, so 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV.

So the correct T1 is 1.005 GeV, and the classical approximation was 1 GeV. The difference is 5 MeV.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. Because the gamma for fragment 1 was 1.00507565, so (gamma-1) is about 0.00507565.

Multiplying by m1 c² (198 GeV) gives 198 * 0.00507565 ≈ 1.005 GeV.

Yes, that's correct.

So the correct T1 is approximately 1.005 GeV.

In the classical case, T1 was exactly 1 GeV.

So the difference is about 0.005 GeV = 5 MeV.

Looking at the options, option B is 5 MeV. So the correct answer would be B.

Wait, but wait. How precise was this calculation? Because I approximated x as 20 GeV, but earlier I calculated x² = 398.99, so x ≈ 19.9747 GeV, which is about 20 GeV. So the approximation is a bit rough, but the answer seems to fit.

I think that's the correct approach.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the fission process using both relativistic and classical mechanics to determine the difference in the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment.

### Key Information:
1. **Initial nucleus**: Mass \( M \), rest-mass energy \( 300 \, \text{GeV} \).
2. **Fission products**:
   - Fragment 1 (more massive): \( m_1 = 0.66M \).
   - Fragment 2 (less massive): \( m_2 = 0.33M \).
   - Total rest mass of fragments: \( m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M \), rest-mass energy = \( 297 \, \text{GeV} \).
3. **Energy released**: \( 300 \, \text{GeV} - 297 \, \text{GeV} = 3 \, \text{GeV} \), which is the total kinetic energy of the two fragments.

### Classical Approximation:
In the classical (non-relativistic) case, the fragments' velocities are related by momentum conservation:
\[
m_1 v_1 = m_2 v_2.
\]
Since \( m_1 = 2m_2 \), this implies \( v_1 = \frac{1}{2}v_2 \). The kinetic energies are:
\[
K_1 = \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2, \quad K_2 = \frac{1}{2} m_2 v_2^2.
\]
Substituting \( v_2 = 2v_1 \), we find:
\[
K_1 = m_2 v_1^2, \quad K_2 = 2m_2 v_1^2.
\]
The total kinetic energy is:
\[
K_1 + K_2 = 3m_2 v_1^2 = 3 \, \text{GeV}.
\]
Thus:
\[
K_1 = 1 \, \text{GeV}, \quad K_2 = 2 \, \text{GeV}.
\]
In the classical approximation, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is \( T_1 = 1 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Relativistic Calculation:
In the relativistic case, the total energy of each fragment includes its rest-mass energy and kinetic energy:
\[
E_1 = \sqrt{(p c)^2 + (m_1 c^2)^2}, \quad E_2 = \sqrt{(p c)^2 + (m_2 c^2)^2}.
\]
Here, \( p \) is the magnitude of momentum for each fragment (equal and opposite). The total energy is conserved:
\[
E_1 + E_2 = 300 \, \text{GeV}.
\]
Substituting \( m_1 c^2 = 198 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m_2 c^2 = 99 \, \text{GeV} \), we solve for \( p \) numerically. After solving, the relativistic kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is found to be approximately:
\[
T_1 \approx 1.005 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Difference Between Relativistic and Classical \( T_1 \):
The difference between the relativistic and classical values of \( T_1 \) is:
\[
\Delta T_1 = T_1^{\text{relativistic}} - T_1^{\text{classical}} = 1.005 \, \text{GeV} - 1 \, \text{GeV} = 0.005 \, \text{GeV} = 5 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The difference between the correct \( T_1 \) value and the classical \( T_1 \) value is **5 MeV**.

**Answer: B**
