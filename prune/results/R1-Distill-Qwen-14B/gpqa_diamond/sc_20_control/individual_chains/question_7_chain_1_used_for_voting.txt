Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and the annihilation of gamma-rays. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question is asking about gamma-ray photons whose lifetimes in the universe are limited by this annihilation process with CMB photons. The process is gamma-gamma -> e+ e-. Right, this must be about photon-photon interactions. I remember that high-energy gamma-rays can interact with the CMB, but I'm not exactly sure how the calculation goes.

So, the average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. Wait, that makes sense because the CMB is low-energy. The typical photon energy is around that, right? Since the CMB is thermal radiation from the early universe, it's in the microwave range.

The process in question is pair production via CMB photons and high-energy gammas. The lifetime of the gamma-rays would be limited by the probability of this interaction. So the gamma's lifetime is determined by how often they interact with the CMB photons. If the interaction rate is high, the lifetime is short.

I think this relates to the idea of photon-photon cross-section and the mean free path. The mean free path is the average distance a photon travels before interacting. The lifetime would be the mean free path divided by the expansion rate of the universe, or something like that.

Wait, more accurately, the mean lifetime τ is the inverse of the interaction rate Γ. So τ = 1/Γ. And the interaction rate Γ is the product of the cross-section σ, the flux of target photons n, and the velocity v of the gamma-ray (which is near c, so v≈1).

So Γ ≈ σ * n * v. But since v is roughly 1 in natural units, it simplifies. The cross-section σ for gamma-gamma to electron-positron pair production is probably known or can be estimated.

Wait, what's the cross-section for photon-photon to e+ e-? I think the cross-section depends on the energy of the photons. For two photons, each with energy E1 and E2, the cross-section peaks when the center-of-mass (CM) energy is sufficient to produce an electron-positron pair. The threshold energy for pair production is 2m_e c², which is about 1.022 MeV. So each photon in the center-of-mass frame must have enough energy to add up to at least 1.022 MeV.

But wait, in the lab frame, where one photon is from the CMB (low energy) and the other is the high-energy gamma-ray. Let me clarify. The CMB photon has energy E_cm ≈ 1e-3 eV, and the gamma has energy E_gamma. So the total energy in the center-of-mass frame would be sqrt( (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2 ), but since the photons are moving in opposite directions, their momenta are opposite. Hmm, perhaps it's easier to consider in the case where the gamma is moving at high energy, and the CMB photon is at rest? No, that's not right because the CMB is isotropic, but the universe is expanding. Maybe I should think in terms of the interaction cross-section formula.

I remember that the cross-section σ for two photons (gamma) to produce a pair (e+ e-) is given by the Klein-Nishina formula at high energies. Wait, maybe not exactly, but the cross-section for photon-photon pair production can be approximated. At high energies, the cross-section increases, but the exact formula is a bit fuzzy in my memory.

Alternatively, I think the cross-section σ is approximately given by σ ≈ (8π/3) (m_e^2 c^4) / (s), where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy. Wait, no, that formula is for the Møller scattering or something else. Alternatively, the cross-section for γγ → e+ e- is something like σ ≈ (8π/3) (m_e^4 c^6) / (s^2) when s is much larger than m_e^2 c^4. Or maybe it's a different dependence. Alternatively, I think the cross-section scales as σ ∝ 1/s, with s being the square of the CM energy.

Wait, perhaps I should look up or recall the formula correctly. Let me think. The process is γ + γ → e+ + e-. The cross-section for this process can be written as:

σ = (8π/3) [ (m_e^2) / (s) ] * [ ... ]

Wait, I'm not getting the exact expression. Maybe an alternative approach: the cross-section for pair production by a photon with energy E interacting with a photon of energy E_cm. Alternatively, perhaps using the threshold condition. The minimum energy required for the photon-photon collision to produce an electron-positron pair is when the center-of-mass energy is at least 2m_e c².

But in our case, the CMB photon has energy E_cm = 1e-3 eV, and the high-energy gamma has energy E. So in the CM frame, the total energy would be sqrt( (E + E_cm)^2 - (p E)^2 ), but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, let's consider the invariant quantity s = (k1 + k2)^2, where k1 and k2 are the four-momenta of the two photons. Since photons are massless, s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. If the photons are moving in opposite directions, their momenta are opposite, so p1 c = |p1| c, and p2 c = |p2| c, but if they're moving in opposite directions, their vectors are opposite. So, (p1 + p2) * c would be |p1| c - |p2| c, depending on direction.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use the invariant s = (k1 + k2)^2. Since the photons are moving in opposite directions, the invariant mass squared s is given by s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (|p1|c - |p2|c)^2. Since E = |p|c for photons, this simplifies to s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2. Let me compute that:

s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2
= [E1² + 2 E1 E2 + E2²] - [E1² - 2 E1 E2 + E2²]
= 4 E1 E2.

Oh, that's a neat result. So s =4 E1 E2. Therefore, the center-of-mass energy squared is s =4 E1 E2. So the square of the center-of-mass energy is 4 E1 E2.

So for the process to produce an electron-positron pair, the center-of-mass energy must be at least 2m_e c², so:

sqrt(s) ≥ 2m_e c² → sqrt(4 E1 E2) ≥ 2m_e c² → 2 sqrt(E1 E2) ≥ 2m_e c² → sqrt(E1 E2) ≥ m_e c².

So E1 E2 ≥ (m_e c²)^2 → E1 E2 ≥ (0.511 MeV)^2 ≈ (0.511e6 eV)^2 → 0.261e12 eV².

In our problem, one photon is from the CMB, so E2 is about 1e-3 eV. The other photon is the high-energy gamma, so E1 is the gamma's energy, E. So E * (1e-3 eV) ≥ (0.511e6 eV)^2 → E ≥ (0.511e6)^2 / (1e-3) eV.

Wait, let me compute that:

(0.511e6 eV)^2 = (0.511)^2 * (1e6)^2 eV² → approx 0.261e12 eV².

Divide by 1e-3 eV: 0.261e12 / 1e-3 = 0.261e15 eV.

So E ≥ 0.261e15 eV → which is 2.61e14 eV. Wait, but that can't be right because the options are in the GeV range. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, 0.511 MeV is 0.511e6 eV. So squared, that's (0.511e6)^2 = (0.511)^2 * 1e12 eV². So 0.261e12 eV². 

Divided by 1e-3 eV (E2 is 1e-3 eV):

E1 = (0.261e12 eV²) / (1e-3 eV) = 0.261e15 eV.

Wait, 0.261e15 eV is 2.61e14 eV, which is 2.61e8 GeV. But the options are way smaller: the highest option is D) 3.9e5 GeV. So I must have messed up the calculation.

Hmm, perhaps I messed up the initial condition. Wait, the condition for the pair production is that the center-of-mass energy is at least 2m_e c². So s = (2m_e c²)^2 = 4 (m_e c²)^2.

But s =4 E1 E2, so 4 E1 E2 ≥ 4 (m_e c²)^2 → E1 E2 ≥ (m_e c²)^2. So E1 E2 must be ≥ (0.511e6 eV)^2.

Wait, but if E2 is 1e-3 eV, then E1 must be ≥ (0.511e6)^2 / (1e-3) eV.

Wait, let's compute that.

(0.511e6 eV)^2 = (0.511)^2 * (1e6)^2 eV² = 0.261e12 eV².

Divide by 1e-3 eV: 0.261e12 / 1e-3 = 0.261e15 eV.

Convert eV to GeV: 1 GeV = 1e9 eV. So 0.261e15 eV = 0.261e6 GeV = 2.61e5 GeV.

Ah, okay, now that makes sense. So E1 is approximately 2.6e5 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 2.6e5 GeV. So that's the cutoff energy.

Wait, but the question is about the energy at which the gamma's lifetime is limited by this process. So gamma-rays above this energy would have their lifetimes limited by this annihilation process.

But wait, the calculation gives the threshold energy E where the process is possible. So above that energy, the interaction can happen, so the mean free path becomes shorter, limiting the gamma's lifetime.

So the answer is around 2.6e5 GeV, so option C.

Another way to think about this: for a photon to interact via pair production with a CMB photon, its energy must be at least about 2.6e5 GeV. So photons with higher energy than that will have their lifetimes limited by the interaction rate.

To determine the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetimes in the universe are limited by the annihilation process $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$ with CMB photons, we analyze the interaction threshold. The CMB photon energy is given as $E_{\text{CMB}} = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$, and the process requires the center-of-mass (CM) energy to be at least $2m_e c^2 \approx 1.022 \, \text{MeV}$ to produce an electron-positron pair.

The CM energy squared is given by $s = 4E_1E_2$, where $E_1$ is the energy of the high-energy gamma-ray and $E_2$ is the energy of the CMB photon. For the process to occur, $s \geq (2m_e c^2)^2$, which implies:

\[
4E_1E_2 \geq (2m_e c^2)^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad E_1E_2 \geq (m_e c^2)^2.
\]

Substituting $E_2 = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$ and $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 0.511 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV}$, we calculate:

\[
E_1 \geq \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_2} = \frac{(0.511 \times 10^6)^2}{10^{-3}} \, \text{eV}.
\]

First, compute $(m_e c^2)^2$:

\[
(m_e c^2)^2 = (0.511 \times 10^6)^2 = 0.261 \times 10^{12} \, \text{eV}^2.
\]

Now divide by $E_2 = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$:

\[
E_1 \geq \frac{0.261 \times 10^{12}}{10^{-3}} = 0.261 \times 10^{15} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Convert to GeV ($1 \, \text{GeV} = 10^9 \, \text{eV}$):

\[
E_1 \geq 0.261 \times 10^{15} / 10^9 = 2.61 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

Thus, gamma-rays with energy $E_1 \geq 2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$ will have their lifetimes limited by the annihilation process. Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:

**C) $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$**.

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and the annihilation of gamma-rays. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question is asking about gamma-ray photons whose lifetimes in the universe are limited by this annihilation process with CMB photons. The process is gamma-gamma -> e+ e-. Right, this must be about photon-photon interactions. I remember that high-energy gamma-rays can interact with the CMB, but I'm not exactly sure how the calculation goes.

I think this relates to the idea of photon-photon cross-section and the mean free path. The mean free path is the average distance a photon travels before interacting. The lifetime would be the mean free path divided by the expansion rate of the universe, or something like that.

Wait, more accurately, the mean lifetime τ is the inverse of the interaction rate Γ. So τ = 1/Γ. And the interaction rate Γ is the product of the cross-section σ, the flux of target photons n, and the velocity v of the gamma-ray (which is near c, so v≈1).

So Γ ≈ σ * n * v. But since v is roughly 1 in natural units, it simplifies. The cross-section σ for gamma-gamma to electron-positron pair production is probably known or can be estimated.

Wait, what's the cross-section for photon-photon to e+ e-? I think the cross-section depends on the energy of the photons. For two photons, each with energy E1 and E2, the cross-section peaks when the center-of-mass (CM) energy is sufficient to produce an electron-positron pair.

The CMB photon has energy E_cm ≈ 1e-3 eV, and the gamma has energy E_gamma. So the total energy in the center-of-mass frame would be sqrt( (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2 ), but since the photons are moving in opposite directions, their momenta are opposite. Hmm, perhaps it's easier to consider in the case where the gamma is moving at high energy, and the CMB photon is at rest? No, that's not right because the CMB is isotropic, but the universe is expanding. Maybe I should think in terms of the interaction cross-section formula.

At high energies, the cross-section increases, but the exact formula is a bit fuzzy in my memory.

Alternatively, I think the cross-section σ is approximately given by σ ≈ (8π/3) (m_e^2 c^4) / (s), where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy. Wait, no, that formula is for the Møller scattering or something else. Alternatively, the cross-section for γγ → e+ e- is something like σ ≈ (8π/3) (m_e^4 c^6) / (s^2) when s is much larger than m_e^2 c^4. Or maybe it's a different dependence. Alternatively, I think the cross-section scales as σ ∝ 1/s, with s being the square of the CM energy.

Wait, perhaps I should look up or recall the formula correctly. Let me think. The process is γ + γ → e+ + e-. The cross-section for this process can be written as:

σ = (8π/3) [ (m_e^2) / (s) ] * [ ... ]

Wait, I'm not getting the exact expression. Maybe an alternative approach: the cross-section for pair production by a photon with energy E interacting with a photon of energy E_cm. Alternatively, perhaps using the threshold condition. The minimum energy required for the photon-photon collision to produce an electron-positron pair is when the center-of-mass energy is at least 2m_e c².

But in our case, the CMB photon has energy E_cm = 1e-3 eV, and the high-energy gamma has energy E. So in the CM frame, the total energy would be sqrt( (E + E_cm)^2 - (p E)^2 ), but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, let's consider the invariant quantity s = (k1 + k2)^2, where k1 and k2 are the four-momenta of the two photons. Since photons are massless, s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. If the photons are moving in opposite directions, their momenta are opposite, so p1 c = |p1| c, and p2 c = |p2| c, but if they're moving in opposite directions, their vectors are opposite. So, (p1 + p2) * c would be |p1| c - |p2| c, depending on direction.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use the invariant s = (k1 + k2)^2. Since the photons are moving in opposite directions, the invariant mass squared s is given by s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (|p1|c - |p2|c)^2. Since E = |p|c for photons, this simplifies to s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2. Let me compute that:

s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2
= [E1² + 2 E1 E2 + E2²] - [E1² - 2 E1 E2 + E2²]
= 4 E1 E2.

Oh, that's a neat result. So s =4 E1 E2. Therefore, the center-of-mass energy squared is s =4 E1 E2. So the square of the center-of-mass energy is 4 E1 E2.

So for the process to produce an electron-positron pair, the center-of-mass energy must be at least 2m_e c², so:

sqrt(s) ≥ 2m_e c² → sqrt(4 E1 E2) ≥ 2m_e c² → 2 sqrt(E1 E2) ≥ 2m_e c² → sqrt(E1 E2) ≥ m_e c².

So E1 E2 ≥ (m_e c²)^2 → E1 E2 ≥ (0.511 MeV)^2 ≈ (0.511e6 eV)^2 → 0.261e12 eV².

In our problem, one photon is from the CMB, so E2 is about 1e-3 eV. The other photon is the high-energy gamma, so E1 is the gamma's energy, E. So E * (1e-3 eV) ≥ (0.511e6 eV)^2 → E ≥ (0.511e6)^2 / (1e-3) eV.

Wait, let me compute that:

(0.511e6 eV)^2 = (0.511)^2 * (1e6)^2 eV² → approx 0.261e12 eV².

Divide by 1e-3 eV: 0.261e12 / 1e-3 = 0.261e15 eV.

So E ≥ 0.261e15 eV → which is 2.61e14 eV. Wait, but that can't be right because the options are in the GeV range. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, 0.511 MeV is 0.511e6 eV. So squared, that's (0.511e6)^2 = (0.511)^2 * 1e12 eV². So 0.261e12 eV². 

Divided by 1e-3 eV (E2 is 1e-3 eV):

E1 = (0.261e12 eV²) / (1e-3 eV) = 0.261e15 eV.

Wait, 0.261e15 eV is 2.61e14 eV, which is 2.61e8 GeV. But the options are way smaller: the highest option is D) 3.9e5 GeV. So I must have messed up the calculation.

Hmm, perhaps I messed up the initial condition. Wait, the condition for the pair production is that the center-of-mass energy is at least 2m_e c². So s = (2m_e c²)^2 = 4 (m_e c²)^2.

But s =4 E1 E2, so 4 E1 E2 ≥ 4 (m_e c²)^2 → E1 E2 ≥ (m_e c²)^2. So E1 E2 must be ≥ (0.511e6 eV)^2.

Wait, but if E2 is 1e-3 eV, then E1 must be ≥ (0.511e6)^2 / (1e-3) eV.

Wait, let's compute that.

(0.511e6 eV)^2 = (0.511)^2 * (1e6)^2 eV² = 0.261e12 eV².

Divide by 1e-3 eV: 0.261e12 / 1e-3 = 0.261e15 eV.

Convert eV to GeV: 1 GeV = 1e9 eV. So 0.261e15 eV = 0.261e6 GeV = 2.61e5 GeV.

Ah, okay, now that makes sense. So E1 is approximately 2.6e5 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 2.6e5 GeV. So that's the cutoff energy.

Wait, but the question is about the energy at which the gamma's lifetime is limited by this process. So gamma-rays above this energy would have their lifetimes limited by this annihilation process.

But wait, the calculation gives the threshold energy E where the process is possible. So above that energy, the interaction can happen, so the mean free path becomes shorter, limiting the gamma's lifetime.

So the answer is around 2.6e5 GeV, so option C.

Another way to think about this: for a photon to interact via pair production with a CMB photon, its energy must be at least about 2.6e5 GeV. So photons with higher energy than that will have their lifetimes limited by the interaction rate.


To determine the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetimes in the universe are limited by the annihilation process $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$ with CMB photons, we analyze the interaction threshold. The CMB photon energy is given as $E_{\text{CMB}} = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$, and the process requires the center-of-mass (CM) energy to be at least $2m_e c^2 \approx 1.022 \, \text{MeV}$ to produce an electron-positron pair.

The CM energy squared is given by $s = 4E_1E_2$, where $E_1$ is the energy of the high-energy gamma-ray and $E_2$ is the energy of the CMB photon. For the process to occur, $s \geq (2m_e c^2)^2$, which implies:

\[
4E_1E_2 \geq (2m_e c^2)^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad E_1E_2 \geq (m_e c^2)^2.
\]

Substituting $E_2 = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$ and $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 0.511 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV}$, we calculate:

\[
E_1 \geq \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_2} = \frac{(0.511 \times 10^6)^2}{10^{-3}} \, \text{eV}.
\]

First, compute $(m_e c^2)^2$:

\[
(m_e c^2)^2 = (0.511 \times 10^6)^2 = 0.261 \times 10^{12} \, \text{eV}^2.
\]

Now divide by $E_2 = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$:

\[
E_1 \geq \frac{0.261 \times 10^{12}}{10^{-3}} = 0.261 \times 10^{15} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Convert to GeV ($1 \, \text{GeV} = 10^9 \, \text{eV}$):

\[
E_1 \geq 0.261 \times 10^{15} / 10^9 = 2.61 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

Thus, gamma-rays with energy $E_1 \geq 2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$ will have their lifetimes limited by the annihilation process. Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:

**C) $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$**.

Answer: C
