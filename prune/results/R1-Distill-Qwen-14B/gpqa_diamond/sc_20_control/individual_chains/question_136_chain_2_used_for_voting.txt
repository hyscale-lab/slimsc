Okay, so I have this vector calculus problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field inside a sphere of radius R. Alright, the vector field f(r) falls off as 1/r² radially. So, the magnitude is f(r) = 1/r², and it's only along the radial direction in spherical coordinates.

Wait, right, so the field is purely radial. That probably simplifies things because I don't have to deal with tangential components. The problem is asking for the integral of the divergence of f over the volume of the sphere.

I remember from my notes that there's a relationship between the divergence theorem and such integrals. The divergence theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux through the surface. So, ∫∫∫ (∇ · f) dV = ∫∫ (f · n) dA, where n is the outward normal vector.

But wait, the divergence theorem applies to vector fields that are smooth and have continuous derivatives inside the volume. So, I should check if this field has any singularities inside the sphere. Oh, right, because f(r) = 1/r², at r=0 (the origin) the field blows up. So, if the sphere includes the origin, this might complicate things.

Wait, the question says it's a sphere of radius R centered at the origin. So, R is positive, and the origin is definitely inside the sphere. So, the origin is part of the volume over which we're integrating. So, f(r) has a singularity at the origin. Hmm, how does that affect the divergence?

Let me first compute the divergence of f in spherical coordinates because the field is radial. Since f is only in the radial direction, the other components (like theta and phi) are zero. So, the divergence in spherical coordinates for a vector field F = F_r ȓ + F_θ θ̂ + F_φ φ̂ is:

∇ · F = (1/r²) d(r² F_r)/dr + (1/(r sinθ)) d(F_θ sinθ)/dθ + (1/(r sinθ)) (1/φ) dF_φ/dφ

But in our case, F_θ and F_φ are zero, so those terms vanish. So, the divergence simplifies to (1/r²) d(r² F_r)/dr.

Since our field f only has the radial component, which is f_r = 1/r². So, substituting F_r = f_r = 1/r²:

∇ · f = (1/r²) d/dr [ r² * (1/r²) ]

Let me compute that derivative. r²*(1/r²) is 1. The derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So, ∇ · f = 0 everywhere except at r=0.

Wait, that's interesting. So, the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin where the function is not defined (since it's singular there). But the volume integral is over the entire sphere, including the origin. So, how does this affect the integral?

Wait, the divergence theorem says that if the field is smooth inside the volume (except perhaps at isolated points), then the integral of the divergence is equal to the flux through the surface. But in this case, the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin. So, the volume integral ∫ (∇ · f) dV would be zero, because ∇ · f is zero except at a single point which has measure zero in three-dimensional space. So the integral would be zero.

Wait, but wait another thought. The divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0. But the flux through the surface of the sphere of radius R (the integral of f · n dA) is equal to the surface integral of (f_r * r^2 sinθ dθ dφ) because n is ȓ, and f · n is f_r. Since f_r = 1/r², on the surface r=R, f_r = 1/R². So, the flux integral becomes:

Flux = ∫ (1/R²) * R² sinθ dθ dφ over the sphere's surface. Let's compute that. The R² cancels, so it's ∫ sinθ dθ dφ from 0 to π and 0 to 2π respectively. The integral of sinθ dθ from 0 to π is 2, and the integral of dφ from 0 to 2π is 2π. So 2 * 2π = 4π.

But according to the divergence theorem, this flux (4π) should equal the volume integral of the divergence. But from earlier, we thought the divergence was zero everywhere except at the origin. So that's a contradiction. Wait, no, maybe I'm missing something here.

Ah, right! Because the field has a singularity at the origin, the divergence theorem as normally stated requires the field to be differentiable everywhere inside and on the surface. But in this case, f is not differentiable at r=0. So, the divergence theorem in its standard form doesn't directly apply. Alternatively, perhaps we can extend the theorem to include such cases.

Wait, but in such cases, like electric fields with point charges, the divergence of the field is a delta function at the origin. So, ∇·f would be 4π δ³(r), where δ is the Dirac delta function.

Wait, because for an electric field, E = k q / r² ȓ, the divergence is 4π q δ³(r). So, in this problem, f(r) = 1/r² ȓ, which is analogous to E with q=1/(4π ε0), but here, they probably just set constants to one. So, the divergence would be 4π δ³(r).

So, if that's the case, then the volume integral of ∇ · f over the sphere of radius R would be 4π times the integral of δ³(r) over that volume. But the delta function is non-zero only at r=0. So, if the sphere includes the origin (which it does, since R is positive and the origin is at the center), then the integral of δ³(r) over the sphere is 1. So, the integral becomes 4π * 1 =4 π.

Wait, but earlier, I thought the divergence was zero because the derivative was zero. But that's only when r≠0. So, in reality, the divergence is a delta function at the origin. So, the volume integral is 4π.

But wait, let's connect this to the earlier approach of the divergence theorem. The divergence theorem in this case would give:

∫∫∫ (∇ · f) dV = ∫∫ (f · n) dA = 4π. 

Which suggests that the volume integral is 4π. But that's only when the divergence includes the delta function. So, if the field f has a source at the origin, the divergence isn't zero, but a delta function. Therefore, the integral would evaluate to 4π.

Wait, but the options are given. Looking back at the options:

A) 4 π

B) 1

C) 4/3 π R

D) 0

So, according to the divergence theorem, the integral is 4π, so the correct answer would be A.

But earlier, I thought that the divergence is zero except at the origin, implying the integral is zero. But that was incorrect because the divergence isn't just zero everywhere else; it's a delta function at the origin. So, the integral over the volume (including the origin) picks up this delta function, giving a finite value.

Wait, but how to reconcile this. The problem is that the divergence is not zero in the mathematical sense, but in the distributional sense, it's a delta function. So, even though the divergence is zero for all r≠0, the presence of the singularity makes the integral non-zero.

So, the correct answer should be 4π, which is option A.

To evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the vector field **f(r)** inside a sphere of radius **R** centered at the origin, we analyze the problem as follows:

The vector field **f(r)** is purely radial and has a magnitude given by **f(r) = 1/r²**. In spherical coordinates, the divergence of a radial vector field **F = F_r ȓ + F_θ θ̂ + F_φ φ̂** is:

\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 F_r \right).
\]

For the given field, **F_r = 1/r²** and **F_θ = F_φ = 0**. Substituting **F_r = 1/r²** into the divergence formula:

\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 \cdot \frac{1}{r^2} \right) = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} (1) = 0.
\]

Thus, the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, where the field has a singularity. To handle this singularity, we recognize that the divergence of such a field is proportional to the Dirac delta function, **δ³(r)**, representing a point source at the origin. Specifically, for a radial field falling off as **1/r²**, the divergence is:

\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = 4\pi \delta^3(r).
\]

The volume integral of the divergence over the sphere of radius **R** is then:

\[
\int_V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f}) \, dV = \int_V 4\pi \delta^3(r) \, dV.
\]

The Dirac delta function **δ³(r)** is non-zero only at **r = 0**, and its integral over any volume containing the origin is **1**. Therefore, the integral evaluates to:

\[
\int_V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f}) \, dV = 4\pi.
\]

This result aligns with the divergence theorem, which states that the volume integral of the divergence equals the flux of the field through the surface of the sphere. The flux calculation confirms this, yielding **4π** as the total flux.

Thus, the volume integral of the divergence of the field inside the sphere is **4π**.
