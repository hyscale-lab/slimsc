Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given as V(r) = 1/2 m ω² r². Oh right, that's the Hooke's law kind of potential, so it's a harmonic oscillator in three dimensions, right?

The question asks for the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to that energy. Oh, okay, so I'll need to figure out the energy levels and the degeneracy for that specific energy.

Wait, in three dimensions, the isotropic harmonic oscillator has energy levels that depend on the quantum numbers in each direction. Since it's isotropic, the potential is the same in all directions, so the energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction.

In one dimension, the energy levels are given by E_n = (n + 1/2) ħω, where n is 0,1,2,... So for three dimensions, the total energy is the sum of the energies in each of the x, y, and z directions. So E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω. So summing them gives E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω.

Wait, no, actually, each direction's energy is (n_i + 1/2) ħω. So for three dimensions, it's (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Alternatively, sometimes it's written as (N + 3/2) ħω where N is the sum of the individual quantum numbers, N = n_x + n_y + n_z. Because N can be 0,1,2,... etc.

So the energy levels are E = (N + 3/2) ħω. So the ground state is N=0, which gives (3/2) ħω. First excited state would be N=1, giving (5/2) ħω. Second excited state is N=2, energy (7/2) ħω. Third excited state is N=3, so energy (9/2) ħω. Because each time you increase N by one, you get the next energy level.

Wait, but let me make sure about the order. Ground state is the lowest energy, which is N=0. So when someone says the first excited state, that's the next higher energy, which is N=1. Second excited would be N=2, third excited is N=3. So yes, third excited state corresponds to N=3, energy (3 + 3/2) ħω = 9/2 ħω. So the first part of the answer should be (9/2) ħω.

Now the second part: how many linearly independent eigenfunctions are there for this energy? That's the degeneracy, the number of distinct states with the same energy.

The degeneracy for a given N in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is given by the number of ways to write N as the sum of three non-negative integers n_x, n_y, n_z. That's the same as the number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = N. The formula for that is (N + 3 -1 choose 3 -1) ) = (N+2 choose 2). Wait, wait, the formula for the number of non-negative integer solutions to a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_k = n is (n +k -1 choose k-1 ). So here k=3, n=N. So it's (N + 2 choose 2) = (N+2)(N+1)/2.

So for N=3, it's (3+2)(3+1)/2 = 5*4/2 = 10. So the degeneracy is 10. So the third excited state has energy (9/2) ħω and 10 eigenfunctions.

Looking at the options:

Option A: (9/2) ħω, 10. That fits.

Option C: same energy but 3 eigenfunctions. So that's probably for the case when the oscillator isn't isotropic, or perhaps a different scenario.

Wait, what if the potential was not isotropic? No, the question says it's isotropic, so the degeneracy is higher. So option A is correct for both parts.

Wait, looking at the other options: option B and D have expressions with pi² and r², which don't make sense for energy in this context because the energy should depend on ω and ħ, and mass. So those options are probably incorrect. So the correct answer is option A.

The problem involves a quantum mechanical system of a particle of mass $m$ in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, $V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2$. The energy levels for such a system are given by $E = \left(N + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega$, where $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$ is the sum of the quantum numbers in the three spatial directions. The degeneracy of each energy level is determined by the number of ways to distribute $N$ quanta among the three directions, which is given by the combinatorial formula $\text{Degeneracy} = \binom{N+2}{2} = \frac{(N+2)(N+1)}{2}$.

For the third excited state, $N = 3$. Substituting this into the energy formula, the energy is:

\[
E = \left(3 + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega.
\]

The degeneracy for $N = 3$ is:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \binom{3+2}{2} = \frac{(3+2)(3+1)}{2} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2} = 10.
\]

Thus, the third excited state has energy $\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega$ and 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: Correct, as it matches the calculated energy and degeneracy.
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as the energy expression involves $\pi^2$ and $r^2$, which are unrelated to the harmonic oscillator energy.
- **Option C**: Incorrect, as it lists the correct energy but an incorrect degeneracy of 3.
- **Option D**: Incorrect, as it lists an invalid energy expression and an incorrect degeneracy.

The correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
