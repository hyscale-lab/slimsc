Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem is about the stability constants of cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes. The solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, with concentrations c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, stability constants. Right, stability constants tell us how stable a complex is. A higher β means the complex is more stable because it means the reaction tends to go towards the complex formation.

So, the complexes in question are Co(SCN)n^m+. The subscript n refers to the number of SCN- ligands attached. The problem mentions dithiocyanato, which would mean two SCN- ligands. So, I think the blue complex is the one with two SCN- ions, so that's the Co(SCN)2^2+ complex, which has β2=40.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the stability constants are for each step. So, β1 is the formation constant for Co(SCN), β2 is for Co(SCN)2, β3 for Co(SCN)3, and β4 for Co(SCN)4. So each β represents the formation from the previous complex.

So the overall formation constant for each complex is the product of the stepwise βs. But wait, no—the way the problem presents them, β1 is the first step, β2 the second, etc. So the overall β for Co(SCN)_n is the product of β1 through βn, right?

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, no, each β is a stepwise formation constant. So β1 is K1 = [Co(SCN)]/([Co][SCN]). β2 is K2 = [Co(SCN)2]/([Co(SCN)][SCN]). Similarly, β3 is [Co(SCN)3]/([Co(SCN)2][SCN]), and β4 is [Co(SCN)4]/([Co(SCN)3][SCN]).

So the overall formation constant for each complex is the product up to that step. So for Co(SCN)2^2+, the overall β would be β1 * β2. For Co(SCN)3, it's β1 * β2 * β3, and for Co(SCN)4, it's the product up to β4.

Wait, but I think that's correct. So each step adds another SCN- ligand, and the overall formation constant for each complex is the product of β1 to βn for n ligands.

So the question is about the percentage of Co(SCN)2^2+ (the dithiocyanato complex) among all cobalt species. To find that, I think I need to calculate the fraction of each possible complex and sum them up, then find the fraction that is Co(SCN)2^2+.

But wait, there's also free Co^2+ in solution. So the total cobalt species includes Co^2+, CoSCN+, Co(SCN)2^2+, Co(SCN)3^3+, and Co(SCN)4^4+.

So how do I approach this? Well, I can model this using the stability constants and the concentrations of SCN- and Co^2+.

Let me think about the general approach. The distribution of metal complexes can be determined using the formation constants and the concentrations of the ligand and the metal.

The problem involves multiple complexes, so I might need to calculate the fraction of each complex relative to the total. The fractions can be determined by considering the formation constants and the concentrations.

I think I should let the concentration of Co^2+ be [Co], and the concentration of SCN- is given as 0.1 M. But wait, the total Co concentration is 1e-2 M. So [Co] + [CoSCN+] + [Co(SCN)2^2+] + [Co(SCN)3^3+] + [Co(SCN)4^4+] = 0.01 M.

Wait, but wait. The problem states the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 1e-2 M, which includes all the species. So the sum of all these complexes plus the free Co^2+ equals 0.01 M.

But this seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a way to compute the fraction of each complex using their stability constants and the ligand concentration.

The general approach for such distribution is to use the following formula for each species:

For each complex i, the fraction fi is given by βi multiplied by [SCN-]^{i} divided by (1 + sum_{j=1}^{n} βj [SCN-]^{j} )

Wait, but each βi here refers to the overall formation constant for the ith complex. So for the first complex, CoSCN+, the overall β is β1. For the second, β1*β2, for the third, β1*β2*β3, and the fourth, β1*β2*β3*β4.

So the fractions can be calculated as:

fi = (β1 * β2 * ... * βi * [SCN]^i ) / ( sum_{k=0}^{4} (β1*β2*...*βk) [SCN]^k ) )

Wait, because the denominator is the sum over all possible complexes (including the free metal, which would be when k=0, which is 1).

Wait, but when k=0, the term is 1, which is the free Co^2+.

So, for each i, fi = (β1*β2*...*βi * [SCN]^i ) / (1 + β1[SCN] + β1β2[SCN]^2 + β1β2β3[SCN]^3 + β1β2β3β4[SCN]^4 )

Ah, yes, that makes sense.

So the denominator is the sum of all possible terms for each complex, including the free metal (which is the 1 term when [Co] is free).

Given that, I can compute each term and sum them to get the denominator. Then, the fraction for the dithiocyanato complex (i=2) is [β1β2 (SCN)^2 ] / denominator.

So let me compute each term step by step.

Given:

β1 = 9

β2 =40

β3=63

β4=16

SCN- concentration = 0.1 M.

Compute each term in the denominator:

Term for Co^2+ (k=0): 1

Term for CoSCN+ (k=1): β1 * [SCN]^1 = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

Term for Co(SCN)2^2+ (k=2): β1*β2 * [SCN]^2 = 9*40 * (0.1)^2 = 360 * 0.01 = 3.6

Term for Co(SCN)3^3+ (k=3): β1*β2*β3 * [SCN]^3 = 9*40*63 * (0.1)^3 = Let's compute this.

9*40 = 360; 360*63 = 22680. (0.1)^3 = 0.001. So 22680 * 0.001 = 22.68.

Term for Co(SCN)4^4+ (k=4): β1β2β3β4 * [SCN]^4 = 9*40*63*16 * (0.1)^4.

Compute this:

9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680 *16 =362,880.

(0.1)^4 = 0.0001.

So 362880 * 0.0001 = 36.288.

Wait, let me double-check:

Wait, β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So product is 9 *40 = 360, 360 *63= 22680, 22680 *16= 362880.

Multiply by [SCN]^4 = 0.1^4 = 0.0001.

So 362880 * 0.0001 = 36.288.

So now, the denominator is sum of all these terms:

1 (k=0) + 0.9 (k=1) + 3.6 (k=2) + 22.68 (k=3) + 36.288 (k=4).

Let me add these up:

1 + 0.9 = 1.9.

1.9 + 3.6 = 5.5.

5.5 +22.68 =28.18.

28.18 +36.288 =64.468.

So denominator is 64.468.

Now, the numerator for the dithiocyanato complex (i=2) is 3.6.

Therefore, the fraction f2 = 3.6 / 64.468 = approximately 0.05557.

Wait, 3.6 divided by 64.468. Let me compute that.

3.6 / 64.468 ≈ 0.05557, roughly 5.557%.

Wait, that can't be right because the options don't have anything that low. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in the calculations?

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck the terms.

Wait, beta1 is 9, beta2 is 40, so their product for the second term is 9*40=360. Then multiplied by (0.1)^2 is 0.01. So 360 *0.01=3.6. That's correct.

For the third term, beta3 is 63. So the third term is β1*β2*β3 * (0.1)^3.

Which is 9*40=360; 360 *63=22680. Then times 0.1^3=0.001. 22680 * 0.001 =22.68. Correct.

Fourth term, beta4 is 16. So 9*40=360, *63=22680, *16=362880. [SCN]^4=0.0001. 362880 *0.0001=36.288. Correct.

Denominator sum: 1 +0.9=1.9, +3.6=5.5, +22.68=28.18, +36.288=64.468. Correct.

So 3.6 /64.468≈0.05557, about 5.56%. But the options are like 16.9%, 25.6%, etc. So I must have done something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I got the wrong complex for the blue color. Oh, wait—could the blue complex be the tetrathiocyanato complex, which is Co(SCN)4^4+? But the question says dithiocyanato, which is two SCN. So, no, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the denominator.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the stability constants are given in a different way. Maybe βn is the overall stability constant for the nth complex, not stepwise. But the problem states that the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, etc., which implies they are stepwise. So I think my approach is correct.

Wait another thought: perhaps the question is referring to the dithiocyanato as the Co(SCN)2^2+, but in solution, some of the higher complexes might dissociate. Wait, but I'm following the correct approach.

Wait, but wait, maybe the sum is wrong. Let me recalculate the denominator:

1 +0.9=1.9

+3.6=5.5

+22.68=28.18

+36.288=64.468.

Yes, correct.

Hmm. So the fraction is about 5.5%, but that's not among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the terms.

Wait, perhaps the stepwise βs are cumulative, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps I should arrange the complexes in order of their overall β and see which is the most stable.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the terms. Let me recalculate each term.

Term for k=0: 1.

k=1: β1 * [SCN] =9 *0.1=0.9.

k=2: β1 * β2 * [SCN]^2 =9 *40 * (0.1)^2 =360 *0.01=3.6.

k=3: β1*β2*β3 * [SCN]^3=9*40*63*(0.1)^3.

9*40=360; 360*63=22680. 22680 * (0.1)^3=22680 *0.001=22.68.

k=4: 9*40*63*16 * (0.1)^4.

9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680*16=362880. 362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Sum is 1 +0.9=1.9, +3.6=5.5, +22.68=28.18, +36.288=64.468.

But that gives a fraction of 3.6 /64.468= ~5.56%, which isn't an option.

But options are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%.

Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Maybe the problem is to consider that the total concentration is 0.01 M, but perhaps I should be considering each complex's fraction based on β and [SCN-], but perhaps I should model the distribution differently.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the concentration of Co^2+ is 0.01 M, and the ligand is 0.1 M. So the formation of complexes depends on the product of [SCN]^n and β.

Another approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex relative to the free ion.

The fraction of each complex can be found using the formula fi = (β1β2...βi * [SCN-]^i) / (1 + β1[SCN] + β1β2[SCN]^2 + ... )

Which is what I did. So why is the fraction so low?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I calculated the overall β for each complex. Let me think again.

Wait, for the second complex (Co(SCN)2^2+), the overall β is β1 * β2. So that's 9*40=360.

But wait, no, I think that's correct. So the term for Co(SCN)2^2+ is 360 * (0.1)^2=3.6.

Hmm.

Wait another thought: perhaps the stability constants are given for the formation from the previous complex, but perhaps the actual complexes are Co(SCN)_n^m, where m = n-1. Because Co^2+ is +2, each SCN- is -1. So Co(SCN)_n^(2-n). So for n=2, the charge is 0. So that's Co(SCN)2^0? Or perhaps I'm thinking of another metal. Hmm, perhaps I'm confused about the charge.

Wait, the problem states that the complexes are Co(II) thiocyanato complexes. So Co^2+ is the central ion. Each SCN- is a monodentate ligand, so for each SCN ligand added, the charge of the complex decreases by 1. So:

Co^2+ (charge +2) + 1 SCN- → CoSCN+ (charge +1).

CoSCN+ + 1 SCN- → Co(SCN)2^0.

Co(SCN)2^0 + 1 SCN- → Co(SCN)3^-1.

Co(SCN)3^-1 + 1 SCN- → Co(SCN)4^-2.

So, the four possible complexes are Co(SCN)^(n), where n is 1,2,3,4, with charges +1, 0, -1, -2 respectively.

But perhaps the actual formation constants are for the neutral complex, which might be more stable. Wait, but the problem gives four β values, so perhaps each represents a stepwise addition.

But that doesn't affect the way I calculated the terms, so I think my approach is correct.

Hmm. Since the initial approach gives a fraction of about 5.5%, which isn't any of the options, I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Alternative approach: perhaps the problem is to find the fraction of the major species, assuming that higher complexes are less likely under these conditions.

Wait, maybe I should compute the fraction of each complex, including the free Co^2+.

Wait, let's list all the fractions:

f0 = 1 / 64.468 ≈ 0.0155 (1.55%)

f1 = 0.9 / 64.468 ≈ 0.014 (1.4%)

f2=3.6 /64.468≈0.0556 (5.56%)

f3=22.68/64.468≈0.3517 (35.17%)

f4=36.288/64.468≈0.5627 (56.27%)

Wait, when I add these fractions: 0.0155 +0.014 +0.0556 +0.3517 +0.5627 ≈ 1.0 (sum ≈1), which is correct.

So the major species is the tetra one, at about 56.27%, then the third is 35%, then the second at 5.56%. But the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is the second one, so 5.56% would be the fraction. But the options don't have this.

So I must have done something wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the stability constants are given for the overall complexes, not stepwise. That is, β1 is the overall constant for Co(SCN), β2 is for Co(SCN)2, etc., so each β is the overall K for that complex.

In that case, the approach changes. Because then the terms would be:

Term for Co^2+: 1.

Term for CoSCN+: β1 [SCN].

Term for Co(SCN)2: β2 [SCN]^2.

Term for Co(SCN)3: β3 [SCN]^3.

Term for Co(SCN)4: β4 [SCN]^4.

So, the denominator would be 1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4.

But wait, that would be if the βs are overall, not stepwise. Let me recalculate all terms with this assumption.

Given:

β1=9 (overall for CoSCN+)

β2=40 (overall for Co(SCN)2^2+)

β3=63 (overall for Co(SCN)3^3+?)

Wait, no, perhaps each β is the overall stability constant for the nth complex. So β1 is the formation constant for CoSCN+; β2 for Co(SCN)2^2+; β3 for Co(SCN)3^3+; β4 for Co(SCN)4^4+.

Wait, but that would mean that for each complex, their respective β is the overall K. So in this case, the terms are:

Term for Co^2+: 1.

Term for CoSCN+: β1 * [SCN] =9 *0.1=0.9.

Term for Co(SCN)2^2+: β2 * (0.1)^2 =40*0.01=0.4.

Term for Co(SCN)3^3+: β3*(0.1)^3=63 *0.001=0.063.

Term for Co(SCN)4^4+: β4*(0.1)^4=16 *0.0001=0.0016.

Wait, but this can't be right because the denominator would be 1 +0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016 ≈2.3646.

So the fractions would be:

f0=1/2.3646≈0.4225 (42.25%)

f1=0.9/2.3646≈0.3806 (38.06%)

f2=0.4/2.3646≈0.169 (16.9%)

f3=0.063/2.3646≈0.0266 (2.66%)

f4=0.0016/2.3646≈0.000676 (0.0676%)

Adding up: 42.25 +38.06=80.31, +16.9=97.21, +2.66=99.87, +0.0676≈99.94%. Close enough, considering rounding.

So the fraction of Co(SCN)2^2+ is approximately 16.9% (f2= ~0.169).

Looking at the options, option D is 16.9%.

So Wait, but earlier approach gave 5.5%, but that didn't match any option. But this approach, considering the βs as overall constants, gives option D as 16.9%.

But the problem states that the βs are the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes. So the term 'stability constant' typically refers to the overall constant for the complex, not stepwise.

Wait, but wait, in the first approach, I treated βs as stepwise, which didn't align with the options. In this second approach, treating them as overall constants, I get option D.

So which one is correct?

Typically, stability constants (β) are given as overall formation constants. For example, the formation of Co(SCN)2^2+ would have a β of 40, which is the overall K for the reaction:

Co^2+ + 2 SCN- ↔ Co(SCN)2^2+.

So in that case, each β is the overall constant for the complex with n ligands.

But wait, the problem says the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, etc. So β1 is the formation constant for the first complex (CoSCN+), β2 for the second (Co(SCN)2^2+), etc.

Ah, perhaps I should have used the βs as the overall constants for each complex, not as stepwise. So in that case, the term for each complex is βn multiplied by [SCN]^n.

So let me redo the calculation with this approach.

Given:

β1=9 → CoSCN+.

β2=40 → Co(SCN)2^2+.

β3=63 → Co(SCN)3^3+.

β4=16 → Co(SCN)4^4+.

So the terms are:

Term for Co^2+: 1.

Term for CoSCN+: β1 * [SCN] =9 *0.1=0.9.

Term for Co(SCN)2^2+: β2 * (0.1)^2 =40 *0.01=0.4.

Term for Co(SCN)3^3+: β3 * (0.1)^3=63 *0.001=0.063.

Term for Co(SCN)4^4+: β4 * (0.1)^4=16 *0.0001=0.0016.

Adding all terms:1 +0.9=1.9, +0.4=2.3, +0.063=2.363, +0.0016=2.3646.

So the denominator is 2.3646.

The fraction for Co(SCN)2^2+ is 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈0.169, which is 16.9%. That's option D.

So the correct answer is D) 16.9%.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought the βs were stepwise. So why did I get a better answer with this approach?

The problem states that β1=9, β2=40, etc. So perhaps in this problem, the βs are the overall constants for each complex, not stepwise. So the initial approach where I treated βs as stepwise might have been incorrect.

Hence, the correct approach is to treat each β as the overall constant for that specific complex, leading to the answer being 16.9%, option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes (Co(SCN)₂²⁺) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants (β) provided. The stability constants are interpreted as overall formation constants for each complex, not stepwise constants. This means:

- β₁ = 9 corresponds to the formation of CoSCN⁺.
- β₂ = 40 corresponds to the formation of Co(SCN)₂²⁺.
- β₃ = 63 corresponds to the formation of Co(SCN)₃³⁺.
- β₄ = 16 corresponds to the formation of Co(SCN)₄⁴⁺.

The total cobalt concentration is given as 10⁻² M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The fraction of each cobalt species is calculated using the formula:

\[
f_i = \frac{\beta_i \cdot [\text{SCN}]^i}{1 + \beta_1 \cdot [\text{SCN}] + \beta_2 \cdot [\text{SCN}]^2 + \beta_3 \cdot [\text{SCN}]^3 + \beta_4 \cdot [\text{SCN}]^4}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the terms for each complex
1. **Free Co²⁺ (k=0):**  
   Term = 1.

2. **CoSCN⁺ (k=1):**  
   Term = β₁ · [SCN] = 9 · 0.1 = 0.9.

3. **Co(SCN)₂²⁺ (k=2):**  
   Term = β₂ · [SCN]² = 40 · (0.1)² = 40 · 0.01 = 0.4.

4. **Co(SCN)₃³⁺ (k=3):**  
   Term = β₃ · [SCN]³ = 63 · (0.1)³ = 63 · 0.001 = 0.063.

5. **Co(SCN)₄⁴⁺ (k=4):**  
   Term = β₄ · [SCN]⁴ = 16 · (0.1)⁴ = 16 · 0.0001 = 0.0016.

### Step 2: Calculate the denominator
The denominator is the sum of all terms:

\[
\text{Denominator} = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the fraction of Co(SCN)₂²⁺
The fraction of Co(SCN)₂²⁺ is:

\[
f_2 = \frac{\text{Term for Co(SCN)₂²⁺}}{\text{Denominator}} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169 \, \text{(or 16.9%)}.
\]

### Step 4: Verify the result
The calculated fraction of Co(SCN)₂²⁺ is approximately 16.9%, which matches option D. The other options (42.3%, 25.6%, and 38.1%) do not align with the calculated value.

### Final Answer:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**.

Answer: D
