Okay, so I have this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

The question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, which was detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. But their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has a shorter period—three times shorter than Planet_2. So if Planet_2's period is, say, P, Planet_1 is P/3. 

Also, both have circular orbits, which is important because eccentric orbits can affect transit probabilities. But here, it's not a factor since they're both circular.

The host stars have the same radii, but different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. Wait, but the radius is the same for both stars. I think that the star's radius affects the transit probability because a larger planet relative to the star makes the transit more likely to be detected. 

Wait, transit probability is roughly the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius, but actually, it's a bit more precise. The probability depends on the relative size of the planet's orbit to the star's size. The formula I remember is something like P = (R_star / a) * (something else?), but maybe it's more involved. Alternatively, the probability is proportional to (R_star / a)^2 times the chance that the orbit is edge-on enough. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Wait, I think the transit probability, given a random orientation, is given by (R_star / a) * (something). Let me think. Oh, right! The transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a), but actually, the exact formula is (R_star / a) multiplied by the probability that the planet's orbital plane is aligned with ours. The latter is 1/(sqrt(1 + (a/(R_star))^2)) ) or something like that.

Wait, perhaps I should recall the exact formula. The probability that a randomly oriented orbit will result in a transit is given by P_transit = (R_*/a) * (1/(sqrt(1 + (a/(R_*)^2)) )) ), but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, another source says the probability is approximately (R_*/a) * (1/(1 + (a/(R_*)^2)^0.5)) ), but I might be mixing up terms here.

Alternatively, I think the transit probability for a circular orbit is P = (R_*/a) * (1/(sqrt(1 + (a/(R_*)^2)) )) ), which simplifies to (R_*/a) * (R_* / sqrt(a² + R_*²)) ) ) = (R_*²) / (a * sqrt(a² + R_*²)) ) = (R_*²) / (a² + R_*²) )^(1/2) * (1/a). Wait, perhaps I'm complicating it.

Wait, maybe the formula is more straightforward. Another approach: When the orbital distance a is much larger than the star's radius, the probability is approximately R_* / a. But when a is about the same as R_*, the probability is higher. But in our case, the star's radius is the same for both planets. So we can compare their a values.

Wait, but both planets have different orbital periods and different host star masses. So I need to find their semi-major axes (a) using Kepler's third law.

Kepler's third law: (a^3) / (P^2) = (G(M_* + M_p)) / (4π²). Since the planet masses are much smaller than the stars, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So:

a^3 = [G M_* P^2] / (4 π² )

So the semi-major axis a is proportional to [ (M_* P² ) ]^(1/3).

Given that, let's compute a for both planets.

Planet_1's star mass is twice that of Planet_2's. Let me denote M2 as the mass of Planet_2's host star, then M1 = 2 M2.

Planet_1's period P1 = P2 / 3.

So for a1 and a2:

a1 ∝ (M1 * P1² )^(1/3) = (2 M2 * (P2/3 )^2 )^(1/3) = (2 M2 * P2² /9 )^(1/3) = [ (2/9) (M2 P2²) ) ]^(1/3 )

a2 ∝ (M2 * P2^2 )^(1/3 )

So a1 / a2 = [ (2/9) ]^(1/3 ) = (2^(1/3)) / (9^(1/3)) ) = (2^(1/3)) / ( (3^2) )^(1/3 ) ) = 2^(1/3) / 3^(2/3) ) 

Which is the same as (2/9)^(1/3) = (2/(3^2))^(1/3) ) = cube root of 2 / cube root of 9. 

Hmm, let me compute that numerically. 2 is approximately 2, 9 is 3^2. 2^(1/3) is about 1.26, 9^(1/3) is about 2.08. So 1.26 / 2.08 ≈ 0.606. So a1 is about 0.606 times a2. So a1 is smaller than a2.

Wait, but wait: a1 is proportional to ( (2 M2) * (P2/3 )^2 ) )^(1/3) = (2 * M2 * P2² / 9 )^(1/3) ) = (2/9 )^(1/3) * (M2 P2² )^(1/3) = (2/9)^(1/3) a2.

So a1 = a2 * (2/9 )^(1/3 )

So the semi-major axes: a1 is (2/9)^(1/3) times a2. Let's compute (2/9)^(1/3). Since 2/9 ≈ 0.222, cube root of 0.222 is about 0.6. So a1 ≈ 0.6 a2.

So a1 is smaller than a2. Let me remember that.

Now, the transit probability depends on (R_*/a), because when the orbit is edge-on, the maximum dip occurs. The probability is higher when a is smaller because R_* / a is larger.

Wait, but there's more to it. The exact probability depends on the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius and the inclination.

Wait, the probability of a transit (assuming random orbital inclinations) is given by (R_*/a) / (sqrt(1 + (a/R_*)^2 )) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I've read that the transit probability is approximately (R_*/a) * (1 / (sqrt(1 + (a/(R_*))^2))) ) = R_* / (a sqrt(1 + (a^2/R_*^2)) ) )

Wait, another way to think about it: The area of the sky where the planet's path would cross the star's disk is a circle with radius R_*, and the area of the possible orbital plane (the sky area) is proportional to a² (since the orbit is a circle of radius a in the sky). So the probability is (R_*²) / (a² + R_*²) )^(1/2) * (1/a) ?

Wait, perhaps I should look up the exact formula.

Wait, I found that the transit probability for a randomly oriented orbit is given by:

P = (R_*/a) * [ 1 / sqrt(1 + (a/R_*)^2) ] 

Which simplifies to:

P = R_* / (a * sqrt(1 + (a²/R_*²)) )

Alternatively, P = (R_*)² / (a² + R_*²) )^(1/2) * (1/a)

Wait, perhaps another approach. The formula can be written as:

P = (R_*) / (a) * [ 1 / sqrt(1 + (a/R_*)^2 ) ]

Let me compute this for each planet.

But wait, for both planets, R_* (the star's radius) is the same, given as the same in the question. So R1 = R2 = R.

So for each planet, P is proportional to (R/a) * 1 / sqrt(1 + (a/R)^2 )

Let me compute this for each planet.

Let me denote x = a / R. Then, P = (1/x) * 1 / sqrt(1 + x² )

So P = 1/(x sqrt(1 + x²)) )

So for each planet, I need to compute x = a / R.

But since a1 and a2 are different, I need to compute x1 and x2.

We have a1 = (2/9 )^(1/3) a2. Wait, no, a1 is (2 M2 * (P2/3)^2 )^(1/3 ) and a2 is (M2 * P2^2 )^(1/3 ), as earlier. So a1 = (2/9 )^(1/3 ) a2.

Wait, but I think we can compute a1 and a2 in terms of R.

Wait, let's find the ratio a1/a2. As I did earlier, a1/a2 = (2/9 )^(1/3 ) ≈ 0.606.

So a1 is about 0.606 a2.

But since R is the same for both stars, x1 = a1 / R = (0.606 a2) / R.

But a2 is (M2 * P2² )^(1/3 ) * (some constant). Hmm, perhaps it's easier to express x2 = a2/R.

Wait, but to compute x, I need a in terms of R. How can I find a in terms of R?

Hmm, maybe using Kepler's third law in terms of the star's radius. Alternatively, perhaps using the Stefan-Boltzmann law or other relations, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to find x for each planet, x = a / R.

But I need to relate a and R. I know that for the star, the radius R is related to its mass and evolutionary state. For main-sequence stars, there's an approximate mass-luminosity relation, but here both stars have the same radius despite different masses. Oh, the question says that the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved, so both stars have the same radii. So R1 = R2 = R.

So, for each planet, x = a / R.

Let me compute a in terms of R.

Wait, using Kepler's third law again. a^3 = (G M_* P^2 )/(4 pi^2 )

So a = [ (G M_* P^2 )/(4 pi^2 ) ]^(1/3 )

But we can express a in terms of R. Hmm, but without knowing R in terms of M, perhaps it's tricky. Alternatively, I need to find a/R for each planet.

Alternatively, since both stars have the same radius, R, but different masses, perhaps I can find a1 and a2 in terms of R.

Wait, perhaps another approach: Using the fact that for stars on the main sequence, the radius R scales roughly with M^alpha, where alpha is around 1-1.5. But in this case, the stars have same R but different M. Hmm, but since one is slightly evolved, perhaps that's complicating things.

Wait, let me think of the problem again. The question is about transit probability, which depends on (R/a). The bigger (R/a), the higher the probability. So if a is smaller, R/a is larger, so higher probability.

So we need to compare (R/a1) and (R/a2). Because R is the same, it's comparing 1/a1 and 1/a2. So the planet with smaller a will have higher R/a, hence higher transit probability.

From earlier, a1 is smaller than a2. So R/a1 is larger than R/a2. So Planet_1 has a higher transit probability.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. 

Since a1 = (2/9 )^(1/3 ) a2, a1 is smaller. So 1/a1 is larger than 1/a2. So (R/a1) is larger than (R/a2). So Planet_1 has a higher R/a, meaning higher transit probability.

Wait, but the transit probability also depends on the alignment, the impact parameter, but for random orientations, the probability is higher when R/a is larger.

Wait, so which planet has higher R/a? Since a1 is smaller, R/a1 is larger. So Planet_1 has a higher R/a, so higher transit probability.

So the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1, as it has a higher probability of transiting.

But let me compute the actual ratio of their transit probabilities to see which option it matches.

Transit probability P is proportional to (R/a) / sqrt(1 + (a/R)^2 )

Since R is same for both, let me compute P for each planet as a function of a.

Let me denote x = a/R.

So P = (1/(x)) / sqrt(1 + x² )

So P = 1/(x sqrt(1 + x² )) )

So we can write P1/P2 = [ (x2 sqrt(1 +x2² )) ] / [ x1 sqrt(1 +x1² ) ]

Wait, no, because P is proportional to 1/(x sqrt(1+x²)), so P1/P2 = [ (x2 sqrt(1+x2² )) ] / [x1 sqrt(1+x1²) ]

But since a1 = (2/9 )^(1/3) a2, and x = a/R, and R is same, x1 = a1/R = (2/9 )^(1/3) (a2/R) ) = (2/9 )^(1/3) x2.

So x1 = (2/9 )^(1/3 ) x2.

Let me compute (2/9 )^(1/3 ). Let me compute 2/9 = 0.2222. Cube root of 0.2222 is approximately 0.606. So x1 ≈ 0.606 x2.

So x1 = 0.606 x2.

Now, let me compute x1 and x2 in terms of each other.

So x1 = 0.606 x2.

Now, P1/P2 = [ x2 sqrt(1 + x2²) ] / [ x1 sqrt(1 + x1²) ]

But x1 = 0.606 x2.

Wait, perhaps substituting x1 = k x2, where k = 0.606.

So P1/P2 = [ x2 sqrt(1 + x2²) ] / [ k x2 sqrt(1 + (k x2 )^2 ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= [ x2 sqrt(1 + x2^2) ] / [ k x2 sqrt(1 + k² x2^2) ) ]

The x2 cancels:

= [ sqrt(1 + x2^2) ] / [ k sqrt(1 + k² x2^2) ) ]

Now, let me square both numerator and denominator to simplify:

= sqrt( (1 + x2²) ) / (k sqrt(1 + k² x2²) )

= sqrt( (1 +x2²) / (k² (1 + k² x2²) ) )

Hmm, but I don't know x2. So perhaps I can find a relationship between x1 and x2.

Alternatively, maybe I can express x2 in terms of x1, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let's assume that a1 = k a2, where k is (2/9 )^(1/3 ) ≈ 0.606.

So, a1 = 0.606 a2.

So, R is same for both stars, so x1 = a1/R = 0.606 a2/R = 0.606 x2.

So x1 = 0.606 x2.

Now, we can write x2 = x1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.65 x1.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to plug in an actual value for x2.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express x in terms of Kepler's third law.

Wait, another thought: Since a is proportional to (M_* P² )^(1/3 ), and R is same for both stars, perhaps I can find a in terms of M and P.

Wait, R is same, so using Kepler's third law, a^3 = (G M_* P^2 )/(4 pi^2 )

But since R is same, perhaps I can relate a and M.

Wait, but without knowing R, or any other parameters, perhaps it's not straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express a/R for each star.

Let me denote a/R = x.

So for each star, x1 = a1 / R, x2 = a2 / R.

From Kepler's law:

a^3 = (G M_* P^2 )/(4 pi² )

Divide both sides by R^3:

(a/R)^3 = ( G M_* P^2 ) / (4 pi² R^3 )

So x^3 = ( G M_* P^2 )/(4 pi^2 R^3 )

But R is same for both, so x^3 is proportional to M_* P^2.

So x1^3 = ( M1 * P1^2 ) / (R^3 )

x2^3 = ( M2 * P2^2 ) / (R^3 )

Taking the ratio x1^3 / x2^3 = ( M1 P1² ) / ( M2 P2² )

Given:

M1 = 2 M2,

P1 = P2 / 3.

So:

x1^3 / x2^3 = ( 2 M2 * (P2/3 )^2 ) / ( M2 P2^2 )

Simplify numerator:

2 M2 * (P2^2 /9 )

Denominator: M2 P2^2

So ratio:

( 2 M2 * P2^2 /9 ) / ( M2 P2^2 ) ) = (2/9 ) / 1 = 2/9.

So x1^3 / x2^3 = 2/9.

Taking cube roots:

x1 / x2 = (2/9 )^(1/3 ) ≈ 0.606.

So x1 = 0.606 x2.

Now, we can write x2 = x1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.65 x1.

Now, back to the transit probability.

P1 = (1/x1) / sqrt(1 + x1^2 )

P2 = (1/x2) / sqrt(1 + x2^2 )

We want to find the ratio P1/P2.

So:

P1/P2 = [ (1/x1) / sqrt(1 + x1^2 ) ] / [ (1/x2) / sqrt(1 + x2^2 ) ]

= (x2 / x1 ) * sqrt( (1 + x2^2) / (1 + x1^2) ) )

We know that x1 = 0.606 x2, so x2/x1 = 1/0.606 ≈ 1.65.

So:

P1/P2 ≈ 1.65 * sqrt( (1 + x2^2) / (1 + (0.606 x2)^2 ) )

Hmm, but x2 is a variable here. To find the exact ratio, perhaps I can express everything in terms of x2.

Let me define y = x2.

So x1 = 0.606 y.

Then,

P1/P2 ≈ 1.65 * sqrt( (1 + y²) / (1 + (0.606 y )^2 ) )

= 1.65 * sqrt( (1 + y²) / (1 + 0.367 y² ) )

Simplify numerator and denominator inside the square root.

Let me compute the ratio inside the square root:

(1 + y²) / (1 + 0.367 y² ) = [1 + y² ] / [1 + 0.367 y² ]

I can factor y²:

= [ y² (1/y² +1 ) ] / [ y² (0.367 + 1/y² ) ]

Wait, perhaps not the best approach. Let me consider two cases where y is large or small.

But I don't know y. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe x is small. Let me think: a is the semi-major axis, which is much larger than R for most stars and planets. But in this case, the problem doesn't specify whether a is larger or smaller than R.

Wait, for a planet in a tight orbit (like Mercury), a is about 0.4 AU, and the Sun's radius is about 0.0047 AU. So a/R is about 85. So x is 85, so x is large.

In our case, the stars' radii are the same, but the planets might be at different a's. Let's suppose that a is significantly larger than R for both, so x is large. Then, 1 + x² ≈ x².

So, for large x:

P ≈ (1/x) / sqrt(x²) ) = (1/x) / x = 1/x².

So, P is approximately 1/x².

So, P1/P2 ≈ (x2²) / (x1² )

But x1 = 0.606 x2, so x1² = 0.606² x2² = 0.367 x2².

So P1/P2 ≈ (x2²) / (0.367 x2² ) = 1/0.367 ≈ 2.725.

So P1 is about 2.7 times P2.

But this is under the assumption that x is large, so a >> R. If that's the case, then P1 is higher.

But the options are:

A) Planet_2 is preferred due to ~2.25 times higher probability.

B) Planet_2 is preferred due to ~1.5 times higher.

C) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times.

D) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times.

Wait, according to my calculation, if x is large, P1 is about 2.7 times P2. So P1 is higher. So the researchers would prefer Planet_1, which is option D or C.

Wait, but in the initial analysis, when a is smaller, P is higher. So if a1 is smaller, then P1 is higher, which aligns with this.

But wait, if x is not very large, perhaps the approximation doesn't hold. Let me check with a plausible value.

Suppose x2 = a2/R = 10, which is a=10 R.

Then x1 = 0.606 * 10 = 6.06.

Compute P1 and P2.

P1 = (1/6.06) / sqrt(1 + (6.06)^2 ) ≈ (0.165) / sqrt(1 + 36.7) ≈ 0.165 / sqrt(37.7) ≈ 0.165 / 6.14 ≈ 0.0269.

P2 = (1/10 ) / sqrt(1 + 100 ) ≈ 0.1 / 10.05 ≈ 0.00995.

Now, P1/P2 ≈ 0.0269 / 0.00995 ≈ 2.706.

Which matches the earlier approximation.

Another example: x2 = 5.

x1 = 0.606 *5 =3.03.

Compute P1: (1/3.03) / sqrt(1 + (3.03)^2 ) ≈ 0.33 / sqrt(1 +9.18) ≈ 0.33 / sqrt(10.18) ≈ 0.33/3.19 ≈ 0.1035.

P2: (1/5) / sqrt(1 +25 ) = 0.2 / 5.099 ≈ 0.039.

P1/P2 ≈ 0.1035/0.039 ≈2.65.

Again, close to 2.7.

So the ratio is approximately 2.7 times higher for Planet_1.

Looking back at the options, option D says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher probability. So the correct answer would be D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula:

\[
P_{\text{transit}} \propto \frac{R_*}{a} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{a}{R_*}\right)^2}}
\]

Here, \(R_*\) is the star's radius, \(a\) is the planet's orbital semi-major axis, and the probability depends on the ratio \(R_*/a\). A smaller \(a\) (closer orbit) increases \(R_*/a\), leading to a higher transit probability.

### Key Information:
1. **Planet_1 and Planet_2** have the same mass, but Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period (\(P_1 = P_2 / 3\)).
2. The host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host star (\(M_1 = 2M_2\)).
3. Both stars have the same radius (\(R_1 = R_2 = R\)).

### Step 1: Relating Semi-Major Axes
Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \(a\) is proportional to:

\[
a \propto \left(M_* \cdot P^2\right)^{1/3}
\]

For Planet_1 and Planet_2:
- \(M_1 = 2M_2\), \(P_1 = P_2 / 3\)
- \(a_1 \propto \left(2M_2 \cdot (P_2/3)^2\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \cdot \left(M_2 \cdot P_2^2\right)^{1/3}\)
- \(a_2 \propto \left(M_2 \cdot P_2^2\right)^{1/3}\)

Thus, the ratio of semi-major axes is:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606
\]

This means \(a_1 \approx 0.606 \cdot a_2\), so Planet_1 has a smaller orbital distance than Planet_2.

### Step 2: Transit Probability Ratio
The transit probability is proportional to:

\[
P \propto \frac{1}{a} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{a}{R}\right)^2}}
\]

Let \(x = \frac{a}{R}\). For large \(x\) (typical for planets), the probability simplifies to:

\[
P \propto \frac{1}{x^2}
\]

Thus, the ratio of transit probabilities is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} \propto \frac{x_2^2}{x_1^2}
\]

Since \(x_1 = 0.606 \cdot x_2\), we have:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \left(\frac{x_2}{x_1}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{0.606}\right)^2 \approx 2.7
\]

### Conclusion:
Planet_1 has approximately 2.7 times the transit probability of Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I have this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

The question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, which was detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. But their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has a shorter period—three times shorter than Planet_2. So if Planet_2's period is, say, P, Planet_1 is P/3. 

Also, both have circular orbits, which is important because eccentric orbits can affect transit probabilities. But here, it's not a factor since they're both circular.

The host stars have the same radii, but different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. Wait, but the radius is the same for both stars. I think that the star's radius affects the transit probability because a larger planet relative to the star makes the transit more likely to be detected. 

Wait, transit probability is roughly the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius, but actually, it's a bit more precise. The probability depends on the relative size of the planet's orbit to the star's size. The formula I remember is something like P = (R_star / a) * (something else?), but maybe it's more involved. Alternatively, the probability is proportional to (R_star / a)^2 times the chance that the orbit is edge-on enough. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Wait, I think the transit probability, given a random orientation, is given by (R_star / a) * (something). Let me think. Oh, right! The transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a), but actually, the exact formula is (R_star / a) multiplied by the probability that the planet's orbital plane is aligned with ours. The latter is 1/(sqrt(1 + (a/(R_star))^2)) ) or something like that.

Wait, perhaps I should recall the exact formula. The probability that a randomly oriented orbit will result in a transit is given by P_transit = (R_*/a) * (1/(sqrt(1 + (a/(R_*)^2)) )) ), but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, another source says the probability is approximately (R_*/a) * (1/(1 + (a/(R_*)^2)^0.5)) ), but I might be mixing up terms here.

Alternatively, I think the transit probability for a circular orbit is P = (R_*/a) * (1/(sqrt(1 + (a/(R_*)^2)) )) ), which simplifies to (R_*/a) * (R_* / sqrt(a² + R_*²)) ) ) = (R_*²) / (a * sqrt(a² + R_*²)) ) = (R_*²) / (a² + R_*²) )^(1/2) * (1/a). Wait, perhaps I'm complicating it.

Wait, maybe the formula is more straightforward. Another approach: When the orbital distance a is much larger than the star's radius, the probability is approximately R_* / a. But when a is about the same as R_*, the probability is higher. But in our case, the star's radius is the same for both planets. So we can compare their a values.

Wait, but both planets have different orbital periods and different host star masses. So I need to find their semi-major axes (a) using Kepler's third law.

Kepler's third law: (a^3) / (P^2) = (G(M_* + M_p)) / (4π²). Since the planet masses are much smaller than the stars, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So:

a^3 = [G M_* P^2] / (4 π² )

So the semi-major axis a is proportional to [ (M_* P² ) ]^(1/3).

Given that, let's compute a for both planets.

Planet_1's star mass is twice that of Planet_2's. Let me denote M2 as the mass of Planet_2's host star, then M1 = 2 M2.

Planet_1's period P1 = P2 / 3.

So for a1 and a2:

a1 ∝ (M1 * P1² )^(1/3) = (2 M2 * (P2/3 )^2 )^(1/3) = (2 M2 * P2² /9 )^(1/3) = [ (2/9) (M2 P2²) ) ]^(1/3 )

a2 ∝ (M2 * P2^2 )^(1/3 )

So a1 / a2 = [ (2/9) ]^(1/3 ) = (2^(1/3)) / (9^(1/3)) ) = (2^(1/3)) / ( (3^2) )^(1/3 ) ) = 2^(1/3) / 3^(2/3) ) 

Which is the same as (2/9)^(1/3) = (2/(3^2))^(1/3) ) = cube root of 2 / cube root of 9. 

Hmm, let me compute that numerically. 2 is approximately 2, 9 is 3^2. 2^(1/3) is about 1.26, 9^(1/3) is about 2.08. So 1.26 / 2.08 ≈ 0.606. So a1 is about 0.606 times a2. So a1 is smaller than a2.

Wait, but wait: a1 is proportional to ( (2 M2) * (P2/3 )^2 ) )^(1/3) = (2 * M2 * P2² / 9 )^(1/3) ) = (2/9 )^(1/3) * (M2 P2² )^(1/3) = (2/9)^(1/3) a2.

So a1 = a2 * (2/9 )^(1/3 )

So the semi-major axes: a1 is (2/9)^(1/3) times a2. Let's compute (2/9)^(1/3). Since 2/9 ≈ 0.222, cube root of 0.222 is about 0.6. So a1 ≈ 0.6 a2.

So a1 is smaller than a2. Let me remember that.

Now, the transit probability depends on (R_*/a), because when the orbit is edge-on, the maximum dip occurs. The probability is higher when a is smaller because R_* / a is larger.

Wait, but there's more to it. The exact probability depends on the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius and the inclination.

Wait, the probability of a transit (assuming random orbital inclinations) is given by (R_*/a) / (sqrt(1 + (a/R_*)^2 )) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I've read that the transit probability is approximately (R_*/a) * (1 / (sqrt(1 + (a/(R_*))^2))) ) = R_* / (a sqrt(1 + (a^2/R_*^2)) ) )

Wait, another way to think about it: The area of the sky where the planet's path would cross the star's disk is a circle with radius R_*, and the area of the possible orbital plane (the sky area) is proportional to a² (since the orbit is a circle of radius a in the sky). So the probability is (R_*²) / (a² + R_*²) )^(1/2) * (1/a) ?

Wait, perhaps I should look up the exact formula.

Wait, I found that the transit probability for a randomly oriented orbit is given by:

P = (R_*/a) * [ 1 / sqrt(1 + (a/R_*)^2) ] 

Which simplifies to:

P = R_* / (a * sqrt(1 + (a²/R_*²)) )

Alternatively, P = (R_*)² / (a² + R_*²) )^(1/2) * (1/a)

Wait, perhaps another approach. The formula can be written as:

P = (R_*) / (a) * [ 1 / sqrt(1 + (a/R_*)^2 ) ]

Let me compute this for each planet.

But wait, for both planets, R_* (the star's radius) is the same, given as the same in the question. So R1 = R2 = R.

So for each planet, P is proportional to (R/a) * 1 / sqrt(1 + (a/R)^2 )

Let me compute this for each planet.

Let me denote x = a / R. Then, P = (1/x) * 1 / sqrt(1 + x² )

So P = 1/(x sqrt(1 + x²)) )

So for each planet, I need to compute x = a / R.

But since a1 and a2 are different, I need to compute x1 and x2.

We have a1 = (2/9 )^(1/3) a2. Wait, no, a1 is (2 M2 * (P2/3)^2 )^(1/3 ) and a2 is (M2 * P2^2 )^(1/3 ), as earlier. So a1 = (2/9 )^(1/3 ) a2.

Wait, but I think we can compute a1 and a2 in terms of R.

Wait, let's find the ratio a1/a2. As I did earlier, a1/a2 = (2/9 )^(1/3 ) ≈ 0.606.

So a1 is about 0.606 a2.

But since R is the same for both stars, x1 = a1 / R = (0.606 a2) / R.

But a2 is (M2 * P2² )^(1/3 ) * (some constant). Hmm, perhaps it's easier to express x2 = a2/R.

Wait, but to compute x, I need a in terms of R. How can I find a in terms of R?

Hmm, maybe using Kepler's third law in terms of the star's radius. Alternatively, perhaps using the Stefan-Boltzmann law or other relations, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to find x for each planet, x = a / R.

But I need to relate a and R. I know that for the star, the radius R is related to its mass and evolutionary state. For main-sequence stars, there's an approximate mass-luminosity relation, but here both stars have the same radius despite different masses. Oh, the question says that the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved, so both stars have the same radii. So R1 = R2 = R.

So, for each planet, x = a / R.

Let me compute a in terms of R.

Wait, using Kepler's third law again. a^3 = (G M_* P^2 )/(4 pi^2 )

So a = [ (G M_* P^2 )/(4 pi^2 ) ]^(1/3 )

But we can express a in terms of R. Hmm, but without knowing R in terms of M, perhaps it's tricky. Alternatively, I need to find a/R for each planet.

Alternatively, since both stars have the same radius, R, but different masses, perhaps I can find a1 and a2 in terms of R.

Wait, perhaps another approach: Using the fact that for stars on the main sequence, the radius R scales roughly with M^alpha, where alpha is around 1-1.5. But in this case, the stars have same R but different M. Hmm, but since one is slightly evolved, perhaps that's complicating things.

Wait, let me think of the problem again. The question is about transit probability, which depends on (R/a). The bigger (R/a), the higher the probability. So if a is smaller, R/a is larger, so higher probability.

So we need to compare (R/a1) and (R/a2). Because R is the same, it's comparing 1/a1 and 1/a2. So the planet with smaller a will have higher R/a, hence higher transit probability.

From earlier, a1 is smaller than a2. So R/a1 is larger than R/a2. So Planet_1 has a higher transit probability.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. 

Since a1 = (2/9 )^(1/3 ) a2, a1 is smaller. So 1/a1 is larger than 1/a2. So (R/a1) is larger than (R/a2). So Planet_1 has a higher R/a, meaning higher transit probability.

Wait, but the transit probability also depends on the alignment, the impact parameter, but for random orientations, the probability is higher when R/a is larger.

Wait, so which planet has higher R/a? Since a1 is smaller, R/a1 is larger. So Planet_1 has a higher R/a, so higher transit probability.

So the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1, as it has a higher probability of transiting.

But let me compute the actual ratio of their transit probabilities to see which option it matches.

Transit probability P is proportional to (R/a) / sqrt(1 + (a/R)^2 )

Since R is same for both, let me compute P for each planet as a function of a.

Let me denote x = a/R.

So P = (1/(x)) / sqrt(1 + x² )

So P = 1/(x sqrt(1 + x² )) )

So we can write P1/P2 = [ (x2 sqrt(1 +x2² )) ] / [ x1 sqrt(1 +x1² ) ]

Wait, no, because P is proportional to 1/(x sqrt(1+x²)), so P1/P2 = [ (x2 sqrt(1+x2² )) ] / [x1 sqrt(1+x1²) ]

But since a1 = (2/9 )^(1/3) a2, and x = a/R, and R is same, x1 = a1/R = (2/9 )^(1/3) (a2/R) ) = (2/9 )^(1/3) x2.

So x1 = (2/9 )^(1/3 ) x2.

Let me compute (2/9 )^(1/3 ). Let me compute 2/9 = 0.2222. Cube root of 0.2222 is approximately 0.606. So x1 ≈ 0.606 x2.

So x1 = 0.606 x2.

Now, let me compute x1 and x2 in terms of each other.

So x1 = 0.606 x2.

Now, P1/P2 = [ x2 sqrt(1 + x2²) ] / [ x1 sqrt(1 + x1²) ]

But x1 = 0.606 x2.

Wait, perhaps substituting x1 = k x2, where k = 0.606.

So P1/P2 = [ x2 sqrt(1 + x2²) ] / [ k x2 sqrt(1 + (k x2 )^2 ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= [ x2 sqrt(1 + x2^2) ] / [ k x2 sqrt(1 + k² x2^2) ) ]

The x2 cancels:

= [ sqrt(1 + x2^2) ] / [ k sqrt(1 + k² x2^2) ) ]

Now, let me square both numerator and denominator to simplify:

= sqrt( (1 + x2²) ) / (k sqrt(1 + k² x2²) )

= sqrt( (1 +x2²) / (k² (1 + k² x2²) ) )

Hmm, but I don't know x2. So perhaps I can find a relationship between x1 and x2.

Alternatively, maybe I can express x2 in terms of x1, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let's assume that a1 = k a2, where k is (2/9 )^(1/3 ) ≈ 0.606.

So, a1 = 0.606 a2.

So, R is same for both stars, so x1 = a1/R = 0.606 a2/R = 0.606 x2.

So x1 = 0.606 x2.

Now, we can write x2 = x1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.65 x1.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to plug in an actual value for x2.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express x in terms of Kepler's third law.

Wait, another thought: Since a is proportional to (M_* P² )^(1/3 ), and R is same for both stars, perhaps I can find a in terms of M and P.

Wait, R is same, so using Kepler's third law, a^3 = (G M_* P^2 )/(4 pi^2 )

But since R is same, perhaps I can relate a and M.

Wait, but without knowing R, or any other parameters, perhaps it's not straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express a/R for each star.

Let me denote a/R = x.

So for each star, x1 = a1 / R, x2 = a2 / R.

From Kepler's law:

a^3 = (G M_* P^2 )/(4 pi² )

Divide both sides by R^3:

(a/R)^3 = ( G M_* P^2 ) / (4 pi² R^3 )

So x^3 = ( G M_* P^2 )/(4 pi^2 R^3 )

But R is same for both, so x^3 is proportional to M_* P^2.

So x1^3 = ( M1 * P1^2 ) / (R^3 )

x2^3 = ( M2 * P2^2 ) / (R^3 )

Taking the ratio x1^3 / x2^3 = ( M1 P1² ) / ( M2 P2² )

Given:

M1 = 2 M2,

P1 = P2 / 3.

So:

x1^3 / x2^3 = ( 2 M2 * (P2/3 )^2 ) / ( M2 P2^2 )

Simplify numerator:

2 M2 * (P2^2 /9 )

Denominator: M2 P2^2

So ratio:

( 2 M2 * P2^2 /9 ) / ( M2 P2^2 ) ) = (2/9 ) / 1 = 2/9.

So x1^3 / x2^3 = 2/9.

Taking cube roots:

x1 / x2 = (2/9 )^(1/3 ) ≈ 0.606.

So x1 = 0.606 x2.

Now, we can write x2 = x1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.65 x1.

Now, back to the transit probability.

P1 = (1/x1) / sqrt(1 + x1^2 )

P2 = (1/x2) / sqrt(1 + x2^2 )

We want to find the ratio P1/P2.

So:

P1/P2 = [ (1/x1) / sqrt(1 + x1^2 ) ] / [ (1/x2) / sqrt(1 + x2^2 ) ]

= (x2 / x1 ) * sqrt( (1 + x2^2) / (1 + x1^2) ) )

We know that x1 = 0.606 x2, so x2/x1 = 1/0.606 ≈ 1.65.

So:

P1/P2 ≈ 1.65 * sqrt( (1 + x2^2) / (1 + (0.606 x2)^2 ) )

Hmm, but x2 is a variable here. To find the exact ratio, perhaps I can express everything in terms of x2.

Let me define y = x2.

So x1 = 0.606 y.

Then,

P1/P2 ≈ 1.65 * sqrt( (1 + y²) / (1 + (0.606 y )^2 ) )

= 1.65 * sqrt( (1 + y²) / (1 + 0.367 y² ) )

Simplify numerator and denominator inside the square root.

Let me compute the ratio inside the square root:

(1 + y²) / (1 + 0.367 y² ) = [1 + y² ] / [1 + 0.367 y² ]

I can factor y²:

= [ y² (1/y² +1 ) ] / [ y² (0.367 + 1/y² ) ]

Wait, perhaps not the best approach. Let me consider two cases where y is large or small.

But I don't know y. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe x is small. Let me think: a is the semi-major axis, which is much larger than R for most stars and planets. But in this case, the problem doesn't specify whether a is larger or smaller than R.

Wait, for a planet in a tight orbit (like Mercury), a is about 0.4 AU, and the Sun's radius is about 0.0047 AU. So a/R is about 85. So x is 85, so x is large.

In our case, the stars' radii are the same, but the planets might be at different a's. Let's suppose that a is significantly larger than R for both, so x is large. Then, 1 + x² ≈ x².

So, for large x:

P ≈ (1/x) / sqrt(x²) ) = (1/x) / x = 1/x².

So, P is approximately 1/x².

So, P1/P2 ≈ (x2²) / (x1² )

But x1 = 0.606 x2, so x1² = 0.606² x2² = 0.367 x2².

So P1/P2 ≈ (x2²) / (0.367 x2² ) = 1/0.367 ≈ 2.725.

So P1 is about 2.7 times P2.

But this is under the assumption that x is large, so a >> R. If that's the case, then P1 is higher.

But the options are:

A) Planet_2 is preferred due to ~2.25 times higher probability.

B) Planet_2 is preferred due to ~1.5 times higher.

C) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times.

D) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times.

Wait, according to my calculation, if x is large, P1 is about 2.7 times P2. So P1 is higher. So the researchers would prefer Planet_1, which is option D or C.

Wait, but in the initial analysis, when a is smaller, P is higher. So if a1 is smaller, then P1 is higher, which aligns with this.

But wait, if x is not very large, perhaps the approximation doesn't hold. Let me check with a plausible value.

Suppose x2 = a2/R = 10, which is a=10 R.

Then x1 = 0.606 * 10 = 6.06.

Compute P1 and P2.

P1 = (1/6.06) / sqrt(1 + (6.06)^2 ) ≈ (0.165) / sqrt(1 + 36.7) ≈ 0.165 / sqrt(37.7) ≈ 0.165 / 6.14 ≈ 0.0269.

P2 = (1/10 ) / sqrt(1 + 100 ) ≈ 0.1 / 10.05 ≈ 0.00995.

Now, P1/P2 ≈ 0.0269 / 0.00995 ≈ 2.706.

Which matches the earlier approximation.

Another example: x2 = 5.

x1 = 0.606 *5 =3.03.

Compute P1: (1/3.03) / sqrt(1 + (3.03)^2 ) ≈ 0.33 / sqrt(1 +9.18) ≈ 0.33 / sqrt(10.18) ≈ 0.33/3.19 ≈ 0.1035.

P2: (1/5) / sqrt(1 +25 ) = 0.2 / 5.099 ≈ 0.039.

P1/P2 ≈ 0.1035/0.039 ≈2.65.

Again, close to 2.7.

So the ratio is approximately 2.7 times higher for Planet_1.

Looking back at the options, option D says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher probability. So the correct answer would be D.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula:

\[
P_{\text{transit}} \propto \frac{R_*}{a} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{a}{R_*}\right)^2}}
\]

Here, \(R_*\) is the star's radius, \(a\) is the planet's orbital semi-major axis, and the probability depends on the ratio \(R_*/a\). A smaller \(a\) (closer orbit) increases \(R_*/a\), leading to a higher transit probability.

### Key Information:
1. **Planet_1 and Planet_2** have the same mass, but Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period (\(P_1 = P_2 / 3\)).
2. The host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host star (\(M_1 = 2M_2\)).
3. Both stars have the same radius (\(R_1 = R_2 = R\)).

### Step 1: Relating Semi-Major Axes
Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \(a\) is proportional to:

\[
a \propto \left(M_* \cdot P^2\right)^{1/3}
\]

For Planet_1 and Planet_2:
- \(M_1 = 2M_2\), \(P_1 = P_2 / 3\)
- \(a_1 \propto \left(2M_2 \cdot (P_2/3)^2\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \cdot \left(M_2 \cdot P_2^2\right)^{1/3}\)
- \(a_2 \propto \left(M_2 \cdot P_2^2\right)^{1/3}\)

Thus, the ratio of semi-major axes is:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606
\]

This means \(a_1 \approx 0.606 \cdot a_2\), so Planet_1 has a smaller orbital distance than Planet_2.

### Step 2: Transit Probability Ratio
The transit probability is proportional to:

\[
P \propto \frac{1}{a} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{a}{R}\right)^2}}
\]

Let \(x = \frac{a}{R}\). For large \(x\) (typical for planets), the probability simplifies to:

\[
P \propto \frac{1}{x^2}
\]

Thus, the ratio of transit probabilities is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} \propto \frac{x_2^2}{x_1^2}
\]

Since \(x_1 = 0.606 \cdot x_2\), we have:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \left(\frac{x_2}{x_1}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{0.606}\right)^2 \approx 2.7
\]

### Conclusion:
Planet_1 has approximately 2.7 times the transit probability of Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.
