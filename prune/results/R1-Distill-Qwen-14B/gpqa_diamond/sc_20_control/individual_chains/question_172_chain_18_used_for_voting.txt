Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So, the excitation level is higher in star_1. I remember that in stars, the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation. Oh right, the Boltzmann factor relates the number of particles in a particular energy state to the temperature.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation is something like n_i / n_j = exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature. Right, so if the energy levels are E_i and E_j, the ratio depends on the exponential of the energy difference divided by kT.

In this problem, the energy difference between the two levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let's denote that as delta E. So delta E = E_i - E_j, but I need to see how that comes into play.

The excitation level is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2. So, for star 1, the number of atoms in that excited state is 2 times that of star 2. So the ratio (n1 / n2) is 2. But wait, in the Boltzmann equation, n_i is the number in a higher state, and n_j is the lower state. So perhaps the ratio is the other way. Let me clarify.

Wait, the question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So maybe n_upper1 / n_lower1 is twice n_upper2 / n_lower2. Or perhaps the ratio of the populations in the excited state relative to the ground state is twice as high in star_1.

Wait, the exact wording says: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." Hmm, the excited state is a specific energy level. So maybe each atom can be in either the ground state or the excited state. Let's say the ground state is E1 and the excited state is E2 = E1 + delta E. So for each star, the ratio of n2/n1 (excited to ground) is given.

Wait, no, perhaps it's the ratio of the number in the excited state to some reference. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is (n_upper / n_lower) for each star.

Let's define for each star the ratio of the number of atoms in the upper energy level (E_upper) to the lower (E_lower). Let's call this ratio R1 for star_1 and R2 for star_2.

So R1 = n_upper1 / n_lower1, R2 = n_upper2 / n_lower2. The problem states that R1 is twice R2. So R1 = 2 * R2.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, R = exp( -(E_upper - E_lower) / (k T) ) = exp( -delta E / (k T) ).

Wait, wait, I should double-check the exact form. The Boltzmann distribution says that the ratio of the number of particles in two states is given by:

n_i / n_j = exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

If E_upper is higher than E_lower, then E_upper - E_lower = delta E. So R = n_upper / n_lower = exp( - delta E / (k T) )

Wait, but wait, that would be the case if E_upper is higher. So for each star, R = exp( - delta E / (k T) )

So for star 1, R1 = exp(-delta E/(k T1)), and for star 2, R2 = exp(-delta E/(k T2)).

Given that R1 = 2 R2.

So let's write that equation: exp( -delta E/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -delta E/(k T2) )

Hmm, wait, no, because R1 is the ratio for star 1, which is 2 times R2, which is for star 2. So:

exp( - delta E/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( - delta E/(k T2) )

Taking the natural logarithm on both sides:

- delta E/(k T1) ) = ln(2) + [ - delta E/(k T2) ]

Multiply both sides by -k:

delta E / T1 = -k ln(2) + delta E / T2

Wait, perhaps I should rearrange the equation.

Let me write the equation again:

exp( - a / T1 ) = 2 exp( - a / T2 ), where a = delta E / k.

Wait, no, because delta E is given, so a = delta E / k.

So,

exp( -a / T1 ) = 2 exp( -a / T2 )

Divide both sides by exp( -a / T2 ):

exp( a (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = 2

Take ln of both sides:

a (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Wait, because ln(exp(x)) is x. So,

a ( (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2)

Because 1/T2 -1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So,

a * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But a is delta E / k. So substituting back:

(delta E / k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Wait, but the problem gives delta E as 1.38e-23 J. So that's a fixed value.

But looking at the options, they're asking about the equation involving T1 and T2. Let's see what the options are.

The options are equations where ln(2) equals some expression involving T1 and T2.

Looking at the options:

Option D: ln(2)= (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Wait, in our equation, the left side is ln(2) equals [ (delta E /k) * (T1 - T2) ] / (T1 T2 )

So unless delta E/(k) is 1, which would make the equation as in option D.

Wait, because let me compute delta E /k. The given delta E is 1.38e-23 J. Let me compute that over k.

k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh wait! So delta E = 1.38e-23 J, and k = 1.38e-23 J/K.

So delta E / k = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

Ah, that's a key insight. So delta E / k = 1 K.

So substituting that back into our equation:

a = delta E /k = 1 K.

So,

(a) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Which becomes,

1 * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Thus,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Which can be written as ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Looking at the options, this matches option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Wait, let me check the other options quickly.

Option A: ln(2) = T2 / T1. Doesn't seem right.

Option B: ln(2) = (T1+T2)/(T1 T2). Hmm, no, because our equation involves (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Option C: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)^2. No, because denominator is T1*T2 squared, which is not what we have.

So the correct equation is option D.

The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The Boltzmann equation governs the distribution of atoms in energy levels, and the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state to the ground state is given by:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. For star 1 and star 2, the ratios of excited to ground state atoms are \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \), respectively. The problem states that \( R_1 = 2R_2 \), leading to:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right) = 2 \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
\]

Dividing through by \( \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right) \) gives:

\[
\exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right) = 2.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Rewriting \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \) as \( \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \), the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

The energy difference \( \Delta E \) is given as \( 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), and the Boltzmann constant \( k \) is \( 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \). Thus, \( \Delta E / k = 1 \, \text{K} \), simplifying the equation to:

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

This matches option D: \( \ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \).

The other options are incorrect because:
- Option A (\( \ln(2) = T_2 / T_1 \)) does not involve the correct relationship between \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \).
- Option B (\( \ln(2) = \frac{T_1 + T_2}{T_1 T_2} \)) incorrectly includes \( T_1 + T_2 \) instead of \( T_1 - T_2 \).
- Option C (\( \ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{(T_1 T_2)^2} \)) incorrectly squares the denominator.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
