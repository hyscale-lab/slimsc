Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question in front of me. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, the question is about a peptidic compound that's been synthesized. The 1H NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton, but they have similar shifts and together integrate to 1H. So, the integral is right, but why two peaks?

Wait, the question says they can rule out spin-spin coupling as the reason. So, it's not a splitting due to neighboring protons. Maybe something else is causing the double peak.

Then, looking at the LC-MS analysis: two peaks of equal intensity, same mass. So the compound has the same mass but appears as two separate entities. They must be different forms but with the same molecular weight.

Options are A to D. Let me think about each.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. But the mass spec would show a different mass if it's a precursor. The question says both have same mass as expected, so A is probably not right.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images, so they have same molecular weight. In NMR, enantiomers don't split each other's peaks because they're not chiral in a way that causes splitting. Wait, but if the compound is a racemic mixture, the NMR might not show splitting because the peaks would overlap. Unless the machine can't distinguish them, but for some compounds, like if they have a chiral environment, maybe there are diastereotopic protons. Or wait, in an enantiomer, each alpha proton would have the same environment, so the NMR would just see one peak. Unless the molecule is not chiral itself, but that's not the case here because the question says it's a peptidic compound, which usually has chirality. Hmm, not sure yet. Let's think more.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. That's a bit technical. Double coupling could imply some sort of coupling beyond normal, but I'm not too familiar. Maybe during the synthesis, like forming an amide, an extra bond formed that causes coupling. But the peaks are for the same alpha proton. Maybe something like a vicinal coupling? I'm not certain. The question says that spin-spin coupling is ruled out, so maybe this isn't the right option.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties. So in NMR, they would show different shifts. But wait, in this case, the two peaks for the alpha proton are similar in shift. If the diastereomers were present, perhaps the alpha protons are in somewhat similar environments, leading to similar shifts. But wait, diastereomers cause different splitting patterns, but the question states that the coupling isn't the reason. So maybe in this case, diastereomers would have different shifts but the question says the peaks are similar. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another angle. The NMR shows two peaks for the same proton, same integration. That suggests that each peak is for a different form of the molecule. If it's a racemic mixture, each enantiomer would have the same proton environments since it's symmetrical. So the NMR would show only one peak, not two. So that would rule out option B.

So if the NMR shows two peaks, but the compound is a mixture of something that still makes the protons equivalent in each form. Hmmm. Wait, maybe the compound is a diastereomer with multiple stereocenters. For example, if there are two stereocenters, and the molecule is a mixture of two diastereomers that have the same alpha proton environment. So their alpha protons would have similar shifts, leading to two peaks. But then, in the NMR, each diastereomer would have their own peaks. But the integrals sum to 1H, which would mean each diastereomer contributes equally.

But for diastereomers, their NMR shifts are usually different enough to be separate peaks. If the shifts are similar, maybe they are in a situation where the two diastereomers have alpha protons that are in very similar environments. For example, if the diastereomers are epimers, but at a position that doesn't affect the alpha proton much.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the molecule has some sort of dynamic process on the NMR timescale, but that's probably not the case here.

Wait, going back to the LC-MS part. Two peaks, same mass, same intensity. That would suggest two components with same molecular weight. But same molecular weight but different structures. So maybe they are isomers.

Looking at the options, if it's diastereomers, their molecular weights are same, so that fits. So option D could be correct.

Alternatively, if it's a mixture of enantiomers, the molecular weight would be the same, but the NMR would not show two separate peaks because the environment for each proton is the same in both enantiomers. Wait, but in that case, the NMR would show a single peak, not two. So option B is less likely.

So, the two peaks in the NMR and the two peaks in the LC-MS probably point towards the presence of two different isomers but with the same molecular weight. So the most likely is diastereomers.

Wait, but why would the NMR peaks integrate to 1H each? If it's a 50:50 mixture, each group would have 0.5H, so together they sum to 1H. So the NMR would show two peaks each integrating to 0.5H. But in the question, the two peaks together integrate to 1H. So each peak is 0.5H? Or wait, the question says together they integrate to 1H. So each is 0.5H.

So that fits with a 50:50 mixture. So in the NMR, each of the two isomers contributes 0.5H to the same alpha proton. So the question is, why would the same alpha proton split into two in the NMR.

Hmm, perhaps if the molecule has diastereotopic protons. Wait, but diastereotopic protons are in different environments but the question says same alpha proton. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the two peaks are from two different diastereomers, each with their own set of protons. So in each diastereomer, the same alpha proton is in a slightly different environment, so the shifts are similar but not identical, leading to two separate peaks.

So in the NMR, for each diastereomer, the alpha proton has a certain shift. If the diastereomers are in a 50:50 mixture, each peak would be 0.5H, and their shifts are close enough to cause two peaks. So that makes sense.

So the options are D and B. But since enantiomers don't split NMR peaks, B is out. So D is the probable answer.

Wait, what about option C? 'Double coupling' during amide bond forming. I'm not very familiar, but I think 'double coupling' might refer to when a proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons, but the question said that spin-spin coupling is ruled out as an explanation. So if it's not coupling, that can't be.

So, putting it together: The presence of two NMR peaks with same shift and same integral suggests the alpha proton exists in two different environments, but in a 50:50 mixture. LC-MS shows two components with same mass. So the compounds are isomers with same molecular weight. The options are D (diastereomers) or maybe a different kind of isomer like epimers or others.

So the correct answer is D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.

The question involves analyzing a peptidic compound where the 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks corresponding to the same alpha-proton, with similar chemical shifts and equal integrals (together integrating to 1H). LC-MS analysis reveals two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass, consistent with the expected molecule. The task is to determine the most likely explanation for these observations.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: The compound is contaminated with a precursor**  
   This is unlikely because the LC-MS analysis shows two peaks with the same mass as the expected molecule. A precursor would have a different mass, which is not observed here.

2. **Option B: The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers**  
   Enantiomers are mirror images of each other and have identical physical properties, including NMR spectra. If the compound were a racemic mixture, the NMR would show a single peak for the alpha-proton, as the environments for the protons in enantiomers are identical. Since the NMR shows two distinct peaks, this option is ruled out.

3. **Option C: 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction**  
   The question explicitly states that spin-spin coupling is ruled out as an explanation for the duplicate peaks. Additionally, "double coupling" typically refers to a specific type of splitting due to neighboring protons, which does not align with the observations. Thus, this option is unlikely.

4. **Option D: The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers**  
   Diastereoisomers have different physical properties and can exhibit distinct NMR shifts. If the compound is a mixture of diastereomers, the alpha-proton could experience slightly different chemical environments in each diastereomer, leading to two peaks with similar shifts. The LC-MS data supports this explanation, as the two peaks have the same mass but represent different isomeric forms. The 50:50 mixture of diastereomers would result in each peak integrating to 0.5H, summing to 1H in total. This explanation aligns with all the observations.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers, as this accounts for the duplicate NMR peaks, the LC-MS data, and the observed integration.
