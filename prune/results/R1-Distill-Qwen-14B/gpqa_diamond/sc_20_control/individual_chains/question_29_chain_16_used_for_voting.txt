Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I need to figure out which mutant would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. Let's break it down step by step.

The question is about a barley cultivar that's drought-resistant but has this anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible has five exons and four introns. The researcher used EMS mutagenesis and found changes in the first exon. I need to determine which mutation would likely stop the compound from being synthesized.

First, I remember that exons are the coding regions of the gene, so mutations there can affect the protein product. The anti-nutritional compound is probably a product of this gene, so if the gene's function is disrupted, the compound won't be made.

Looking at the options, each mutant has a different change in the first exon. I think I need to look at the DNA sequences to see what kind of mutations they are and how they might affect the protein.

The intact gene's first part is: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So comparing, the 4th position in the original is C, but in Mutant 1 it's T. Let me count the letters:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT …
Mutant 1: ATG TT CT ACG CTG GTA CT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC …

Wait, maybe I should look at the exact changes. Let me write the first part:

Original (positions 1-20 maybe? Let's see):

1-20: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACT

Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACT

So position 4: Original is T, mutant is C? Wait, perhaps I should compare each position.

Wait, original starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

Mutant 1: ATG TTCTACGCTGGTACT...

Wait, perhaps it's easier to look for where the changes are. The problem states that the changes are at the beginning of the sequence in the first exon area.

Let me compare each mutant to the original.

Original: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Let's look at each mutant:

Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So, the original's first few nucleotides are ATG TTT CTC GCT G... 
Mutant 1: ATG TTCTACGCTG...

Wait, perhaps comparing each change:

Original: positions 1-20 (approx):

1: A
2: T
3: G
4: T
5: T
6: C
7: T
8: C
9: G
10: C
11: T
12: G
13: G
14: T
15: A
16: C
17: T
18: T
19: C
20: G

Wait, perhaps I should write the original and mutants' sequences in a way that the differences are clear.

Original: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Comparing, in the first part:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT …

Mutant 1: ATG TTCTACGCTGGTACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC …

Hmm, looking at the first part, the original has TTTCTCGCT, and mutant 1 has TTCTACGCT. So, it's a substitution from CTCG to TACG?

Wait, perhaps it's a substitution of a triplet. Let me check the exact positions.

Let me number the nucleotides:

Original: positions 1-20 (each letter is a position).

1: A
2: T
3: G
4: T
5: T
6: C
7: T
8: C
9: G
10: C
11: T
12: G
13: G
14: T
15: A
16: C
17: T
18: T
19: C
20: G

Mutant 1: positions 1-20:

1: A
2: T
3: G
4: T
5: T
6: C
7: T
8: A
9: C
10: G
11: C
12: T
13: G
14: T
15: A
16: C
17: T
18: T
19: C
20: G

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me see: the original's 6th base is C. In Mutant 1, the 6th is C as well. Wait, perhaps I should look for where the change is.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to look for the exact point where each mutant differs.

Looking at Mutant 1's sequence:

Original: ...CTCGCTGGTACT...
Mutant 1: ...CTACGCTGGTACT...

So the original has "CTC GCT", and the mutant has "CTA CGC". Wait, so is it a change from CTC to CT A? No, wait, perhaps the original is CTC GCT, which is positions 6-10: C T C G C T?

Wait, maybe I should align them:

Original (positions 5-10): T C T C G C

Mutant 1: T C A C G C

So positions 8 and 9 in the original are C and G, but in mutant 1, it's A and C? Not sure. Maybe I should look for the exact difference.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for how each mutation affects the amino acid sequence. Because a mutation that changes the amino acid could potentially disrupt the function of the protein, such as creating a premature stop codon or altering the active site.

The original sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon (methionine). Then, the next codons are TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), etc.

Let me write the original and each mutant's first few codons.

Original:
ATG (M)
TTT (Phe)
CTC (Leu)
GCT (Ala)
GGT (Gly)
ACT (Thr)
TCT (Ser)
GTG (Val)
GAT (Asp)
GAA (Glu)
CAT (His)
ATA (Ile)
TTT (Phe)
TGT (Cys)
CGT (Arg)
... 

Mutant 1:
ATG (M)
TTT (Phe)
CTC (Leu)
GCT → Wait, original has GCT, but mutant 1 has GCT? Or maybe the change is elsewhere. Wait, the first part of Mutant 1 is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACT...

So, breaking into codons:
ATG (M)
TTT (Phe)
CTA (Leu) [since CTA is Leu]
CGC (Arg)
GCT (Ala)
GGT (Gly)
ACT (Thr)
TCT (Ser)
GTG (Val)
GAT (Asp)
GAA (Glu)
CAT (His)
ATA (Ile)
TTT (Phe)
TGT (Cys)
CGC (Arg)
...

Wait, so the original has "CTC GCT" which is Leu Ala, and Mutant 1 has "CTA CGC" which is Leu Arg. So the third codon (position 7-9) changes from GCT (Ala) to CGC (Arg). That's a substitution of amino acid from Ala to Arg.

So, in Mutant 1, the third codon is CGC (Arg). So the second codon is still Phe, third is Leu, fourth is Arg instead of Ala.

Hmm, that's a substitution but doesn't introduce a stop codon. So the protein might still be made, but with a different amino acid. Unless the substitution disrupts a crucial part of the protein.

Mutant 2:
5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Let me break this into codons:

ATG (M)
TTT (Phe)
CTA (Leu)
AGC (Ser)
TGG (Trp)
GTA (Val)
CTT (Leu)
GTG (Val)
GAT (Asp)
GAA (Glu)
CAT (His)
ATA (Ile)
TTT (Phe)
TGT (Cys)
CGC (Arg)
... 

So the original's third codon was GCT (Ala), and in Mutant 2, it's AGC (Ser). Wait, let me see:

Original: codons 3 and 4 are CTC (Leu) and GCT (Ala), so positions 7-9: CTC, 10-12: GCT.

Mutant 2: looking at the first part, it's ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACT...

Codons would be:

1: ATG (M)
2: TTT (Phe)
3: CTA (Leu)
4: AGC (Ser)
5: TGG (Trp)
6: GCT (Ala) → Wait, no, let me count:

Wait, the sequence is ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACT...

Breaking into triplets:

ATG, TTT, CTA, AGC, TGG, GTA, CTT, GTG...

So, positions 7-9 (third codon): CTA (Leu)
Positions 10-12: AGC (Ser)
Original had at positions 10-12: GCT (Ala).

So in Mutant 2, the fourth codon is Ser instead of Ala. So the protein has a Leu, then Ser, then Trp, etc. Again, substitution but no stop codon.

Mutant 3:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Breaking into codons:

ATG (M)
TTT (Phe)
TTT (Phe)
TAC (Tyr)
GCT (Ala)
GGT (Gly)
GTC (Val)
ACT (Thr)
TCT (Ser)
GTG (Val)
GAT (Asp)
GAA (Glu)
CAT (His)
ATA (Ile)
TTT (Phe)
TGT (Cys)
CGT (Arg)
...

Wait, let's count. Original:

Original: codons 2-4 are TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala).

Mutant 3's sequence is ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

So, codons:

1: ATG (M)
2: TTT (Phe)
3: TTT (Phe)
4: TAC (Tyr)
5: GCT (Ala)
6: GGT (Gly)
7: GTC (Val)
8: ACT (Thr)
9: TCT (Ser)
10: GTG (Val)
... 

So compared to original, the second codon is still Phe. Third codon in original was CTC (Leu), but in Mutant 3, the third codon is TAC (Tyr)? Wait, no, let's look again.

The original sequence after ATG is TTTCTCGCTGGTACT.

Mutant 3's sequence after ATG is TT TTA CGCTGGTGTCA...

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me line them up:

Original starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT ...

Mutant 3: ATG TTT TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC TT...

Wait, so the original's positions after ATG are TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

Mutant 3: TTT TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC ...

So codon 2 is same (TTT Phe), codon 3 is TTA (Leu), codon 4 is CGC (Arg), codon 5 is TGG (Trp), etc.

Wait, original codon 3 is CTC (Leu), and in Mutant 3, it's TTA (Leu) again. So same amino acid.

But codon 4: original is GCT (Ala), Mutant 3 is CGC (Arg). So that's a substitution from Ala to Arg. Also, codon 5 in original is GGT (Gly), and in Mutant 3, after CGC is TGG (Trp), so that's a substitution from Gly to Trp.

So, again, substitutions but no stop codon.

Mutant 4:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Let's break into codons.

ATG (M)
TTT (Phe)
TTT (Phe)
TAC (Tyr)
GCT (Ala)
ACT (Thr)
TCT (Ser)
GTG (Val)
GAT (Asp)
GAA (Glu)
CAT (His)
ATA (Ile)
TTT (Phe)
TGT (Cys)
CGT (Arg)
...

Wait, the original after ATG is TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG... 

Mutant 4's sequence: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

So, the first part:

ATG, TTT, TTA, CGC, TAC, TTT, TCT, GTG...

Wait, no, let me look again. The original is CTC GCT GGT ACT ... and Mutant 4 is CGCTACT...

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compare:

Original part: CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG ...

Mutant 4: CGC TAC TCT ...

Wait, perhaps the codons are:

After ATG TTT:

Original: CTC (Leu) GCT (Ala) GGT (Gly) ACT (Thr) TCT (Ser) GTG (Val) ...

Mutant4: CGC (Arg) TAC (Tyr) TCT (Ser) GTG (Val) ...

So, the first few codons after ATG TTT are:

Original: CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val)

Mutant4: CGC (Arg), TAC (Tyr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), ...

Wait, no, the original and mutant4 sequences:

Original: ...CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGG...

Mutant4: ...CGCTACTTCTGTGG...

So, after ATG TTT, the original is CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant4: CGC TAC TCT GTG GAT...

So when broken into codons:

Original:
ATG (M)
TTT (Phe)
CTC (Leu)
GCT (Ala)
GGT (Gly)
ACT (Thr)
TCT (Ser)
GTG (Val)
GAT (Asp)
...

Mutant4:
ATG (M)
TTT (Phe)
CTC (Leu)
GCT → wait, no, let me see:

Wait, the sequence for mutant4 is ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGAT...

So after ATG TTT, the next is TAC GCT ACT TCT...

Wait, maybe the first few codons are:

ATG (M)
TTT (Phe)
TTT (Phe)
TAC (Tyr)
GCT (Ala)
ACT (Thr)
TCT (Ser)
GTG (Val)
GAT (Asp)
...

Wait, so let me see:

1-3: ATG (M)
4-6: TTT (Phe)
7-9: TTA (Leu)
10-12: CGC (Arg)
13-15: TAC (Tyr)
16-18: GCT (Ala)
19-21: ACT (Thr)
22-24: TCT (Ser)
25-27: GTG (Val)
...

Wait, original's first codons after ATG were TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), etc.

In Mutant4, the sequence after ATG TTT is TTA CGC TAC GCT ACT TCT ...

So, codons:

3: TTA (Leu)
4: CGC (Arg)
5: TAC (Tyr)
6: GCT (Ala)
7: ACT (Thr)
8: TCT (Ser)
9: GTG (Val)
...

So the original's codons 3 and 4 were CTC (Leu) and GCT (Ala). In Mutant4, codon 3 is TTA (Leu), codon4 is CGC (Arg), codon5 is TAC (Tyr), etc.

Wait, but when I look at the entire sequence for Mutant4, perhaps there's a frame shift or a stop codon. Because the question is about eliminating the anti-nutritional compound, which is likely due to the gene product. So if the gene is nonfunctional, the compound won't be made.

But in all the mutants, the exons are in the same reading frame? Or could there be a frameshift due to insertions or deletions? Looking at the sequences, I don't see any insertions or deletions. All the changes seem to be substitutions.

Wait, but looking at Mutant4's sequence: the original has more nucleotides in the first exon. Let me count the length.

Original starts with 20 bases: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Mutant4: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

So, the original's first part is longer? Or perhaps, in Mutant4, a part is missing.

Wait, perhaps the original has "GCTGGTACT" and mutant4 has "GCTACT".

Wait, perhaps in Mutant4, the 11th to 14th nucleotides are missing some bases, causing a frameshift.

Wait, let me compare the lengths.

Original: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant4: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Looking at the first part:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Mutant4: ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Wait, perhaps in Mutant4, the sequence after ATG is ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TCT ... So, codons:

1-3: ATG (M)
4-6: TTT (Phe)
7-9: TTA (Leu)
10-12: CGC (Arg)
13-15: TAC (Tyr)
16-18: TCT (Ser)
19-21: GTG (Val)
22-24: GAT (Asp)
...

Wait, original's codon 4 is GCT (Ala), but in Mutant4, codon4 is CGC (Arg), so it's a substitution.

But wait, the original had more nucleotides? Let me count the letters.

Original's first exon area: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Let me count the letters in the first exon. Let's see: the original's first part is 20 letters.

Mutant4's first part is ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

So, same length? Wait, maybe I'm miscounting.

Alternatively, perhaps in Mutant4, there's a deletion. Let's check:

Original sequence (first part):

After ATG, the next part is TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGG...

Mutant4's sequence after ATG is TT TTA CGC TAC TCT GTG GAT...

Wait, perhaps the original has a longer stretch. Let me count the letters:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TAT TGT CGT …
Mutant4: ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TAT TGT CGT …

Wait, in Mutant4, the sequence after ATG is TTT TTA CGC TAC TCT... So, perhaps in Mutant4, after the initial TTT, it's TTA CGC TAC TCT... but the original has CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

So, in the original, it's CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), etc.

In Mutant4, it's TTA (Leu), CGC (Arg), TAC (Tyr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), etc.

So, in the original, codons 4,5,6,7 are GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser). In Mutant4, codons 4,5 are CGC (Arg), TAC (Tyr), TCT (Ser), etc.

So, perhaps Mutant4's changes are substitutions but no frameshift. So, all the mutants have substitutions but no frameshift.

But the question is about which mutation would eliminate the compound. So, maybe a nonsense mutation (introducing a stop codon) would cause the gene to be nonfunctional.

Looking back at the sequences, are any of the mutants introducing a stop codon?

The original continues beyond the sequences shown, but let's look at the ends of the given sequences.

The original ends with ...TGA-3’ (TGA is a stop codon, but it's at the end of the mRNA, so it's the termination codon.

In the mutants, all have TGA at the end.

But the question is whether any of the mutations introduced a stop codon earlier.

Looking at the sequences in the first exon:

Original: ...CTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Mutant1: ...CTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…

Mutant2: ...CTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…

Mutant3: ...CTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Mutant4: ...CTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Wait, the original has ...TGT CGT... which is Cys Arg.

Mutant1: ...TGT CGC (Cys Arg to Cys Arg? Wait, CGT is Arg; CGC is also Arg.

Wait, looking at the specific parts.

Original: ...TGT CGT... (Cys Arg)
Mutant1: ...TGT CGC (Cys Arg)
Same amino acids, since CGT and CGC are both Arg.

Mutant2: same as Mutant1 in this region.

But wait, looking at the middle of the sequences:

In Mutant4, the sequence is ...TAC TCT GTG GAT...

Hmm, I'm not seeing any stop codons introduced in the middle of the sequences shown.

Wait, let me check the codons again.

Original's first part: ...TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Mutant1: ...TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Mutant2: ...TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Mutant3: ...TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Mutant4: ...TCT GTG GAT GAA...

So, in the middle, none of the mutations seem to introduce a stop codon.

Wait, but what about the original and mutant sequences beyond what's shown? Like, maybe a mutation introduced a stop codon elsewhere. But since the problem states that the changes are at the beginning of the sequence, perhaps in the first exon, the rest is unchanged.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation leads to a frameshift, causing a premature stop codon downstream. But as I looked before, all the mutations are substitutions, not insertions or deletions, so no frameshift.

Wait, but maybe in Mutant4, the sequence is shorter, leading to a frameshift.

Wait, looking again at the lengths:

Original: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant4: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

So, the part after ATG is:

Original: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Mutant4: TTT TTA CGC TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Counting the number of nucleotides:

Original's first part: Let's take 24 letters after ATG.

Mutant4's first part: same number of letters? Or does it have a deletion.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to count the letters.

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TAT TGT CGT ...TGA.

Mutant4: ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TAT TGT CGT ...TGA.

So, the first part after ATG is TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Mutant4: TTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Hmm, it's possible that the Mutant4 has fewer nucleotides, but in the given sequences, the length seems similar. If there's a deletion, it's hard to see from the given info.

Wait, perhaps I should look for an in-frame stop codon. For that, any of the codons in the mutants must be a stop codon.

The stop codons are UAA, UAG, UGA. In DNA terms, that would be TAA, TAG, TGA.

Looking at the sequences:

Original has TGA at the end.

Mutant1: ...CGT…TGA.

So, in their sequences, the TGA is still at the end.

Are any of the mutations introducing a TAA, TAG, or TGA in the middle?

Looking at Mutant4's sequence: ...TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TAT TGT CGT ...TGA.

Wait, in Mutant4, the 13th to 15th codon is TAC (Tyr), then TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), CAA (Gln), TAT (Tyr), TAT (Tyr), TGT (Cys), CGT (Arg), and then TGA.

No stop codons in the middle.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Since the anti-nutritional compound is a product of the gene, disrupting the gene's function would eliminate it. So, which mutation would disrupt the gene's function?

Mutations that cause a frameshift would lead to a completely scrambled protein from the mutation point onward. But in our case, all mutations are substitutions, so the frame remains the same.

Substitution mutations can cause missense (no stop) or nonsense (stop codon) mutations.

Looking for any mutation that creates a stop codon early in the sequence.

Original: ...CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Mutant1: ...CTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…

Mutant2: ...CTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…

Mutant3: ...TACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Mutant4: ...TACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Looking for any TGA, TAG, TAA codons in the middle.

In Mutant4, looking at the middle, let's see:

Mutant4's sequence: ...TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TAT TGT CGT ...TGA.

Wait, the codon after TAC is TCT (Ser). Then GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), CAA (Gln), TAT (Tyr), TAT (Tyr), TGT (Cys), CGT (Arg), then TGA.

No stop codons in the middle.

What about Mutant3: ...TACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Breaking into codons:

TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), GTC (Val), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), etc.

No stop codons here.

Mutant2: ...CTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…

Codons:

CTA (Leu), AGC (Ser), TGG (Trp), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), etc.

No stop codons.

Mutant1: ...CTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…

Codons:

CTA (Leu), CGC (Arg), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), etc.

No stop codons in the middle.

Hmm, so none of the mutants in the given sequences have introduced a stop codon before the original TGA. So none of them would cause a truncated protein due to a premature stop.

But wait, perhaps in the middle of the gene, a mutation introduces a stop codon. For example, if in a later part of the sequence, a TGA appears.

But without the full sequence, it's hard to say. However, the question states that the changes are in the beginning of the first exon. So perhaps the mutations are in the first exon, but the rest of the gene is the same.

So, perhaps the correct approach is to find a mutation that disrupts the reading frame, but earlier I thought all mutations are substitutions, so no frameshift.

Wait, but wait: in the given sequences, perhaps one of them has a deletion or insertion that causes a frameshift, leading to a stop codon.

Looking back, all the mutants have the same length as the original? Or is there a change in the length.

Original starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’.

Count the letters in the first part: Original has more letters? Let me count the nucleotides.

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TAT TGT CGT …
That's 27 nucleotides (9 codons) after ATG.

Mutant1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TCT TGT GGA TGA A...
Wait, perhaps it's the same length. So substitutions, no frameshift.

So, perhaps the only way to eliminate the compound is to disrupt the gene's function through a nonsense mutation (stop codon) or a missense mutation that disrupts the protein's function.

But without a stop codon in the middle, perhaps a missense mutation that disrupts a critical part of the protein.

Which mutation would cause the most drastic change? Let's look at the amino acid changes.

Original amino acids:
Positions 1-10 (approx):

M, Phe, Leu, Ala, Gly, Thr, Ser, Val, Asp, Glu.

Mutant1:

M, Phe, Leu, Arg, Ala, Gly, Thr, Ser, Val, Asp.

Change at position 4 from Ala to Arg.

Mutant2:

M, Phe, Leu, Ser, Trp, Ala, Leu, Val, Asp, Glu.

Change at position 4 from Ala to Ser.

Mutant3:

M, Phe, Phe, Tyr, Ala, Gly, Val, Thr, Ser, Val.

Change from Phe to Phe (no change?), then Tyr, etc.

Wait, in Mutant3, the third codon is TTA (Leu), same as original's CTC (Leu), so same amino acid. Fourth codon CGC (Arg) instead of GCT (Ala). Fifth codon TGG (Trp) instead of GGT (Gly).

So, position 4: Ala → Arg; position5: Gly → Trp.

Mutant4:

M, Phe, Leu, Arg, Tyr, Ser, Val, Asp, Glu.

Change from positions 4 and beyond.

So, position4: Ala → Arg; position5: Gly → Tyr.

Wait, which of these changes would most likely disrupt the protein function?

It's possible that a change in the active site or a critical region would disrupt the synthesis of the compound. But without knowing the structure, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps a nonsense mutation (introducing a stop codon) is the best way to eliminate the compound. But looking at the given sequences, none of the mutants have introduced a stop codon in the middle.

Wait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the sequences.

In Mutant4, the sequence after ATG is TT TTA CGC TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA ... So, codons:

ATG (M)
TTT (Phe)
TTT (Phe)
TAC (Tyr)
GCT (Ala)
ACT (Thr)
TCT (Ser)
GTG (Val)
GAT (Asp)
GAA (Glu)
...

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me write the entire sequence for Mutant4:

Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Breaking into triplets:

1: ATG (M)
2: TTT (Phe)
3: TTT (Phe)
4: TAC (Tyr)
5: GCT (Ala)
6: ACT (Thr)
7: TCT (Ser)
8: GTG (Val)
9: GAT (Asp)
10: GAA (Glu)
11: CAT (His)
12: ATA (Ile)
13: TTT (Phe)
14: TGT (Cys)
15: CGT (Arg)
16: ... (continuing until stop)
17: TGA (stop)

So, in Mutant4, codon 4 is TAC (Tyr), codon5 is GCT (Ala), same as original's codon3. Wait, this might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the reading frame is shifted, but no, as it's substitutions.

Wait, perhaps the original's codon4 is GCT (Ala), and in Mutant4, it's GCT (Ala) as well. Hmm, no, the original's codon4 is GCT, and Mutant4's codon5 is GCT.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused again. Let me try another approach.

Which mutation is most likely to cause a frameshift? None, as all are substitutions.

Which mutation introduces a stop codon early in the sequence?

Looking again, perhaps Mutant4's sequence doesn't have a stop codon in the middle. So all the mutants have substitutions but not introducing a stop codon.

Hmm. Maybe the question is looking for a mutation that creates a stop codon in the first exon, thus truncating the protein early.

Looking at the sequences, does any of the mutations create a TAA, TAG, or TGA before the end?

In Mutant4's sequence, after the initial ATG, the codons are:

ATG (M), TTT (Phe), TTT (Phe), TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), etc.

No stop codons in the middle. Original's stop is at TGA.

Wait, but perhaps in Mutant4, the sequence after TAC is TCT, which is Ser, then GTG (Val), etc. No stop.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4, perhaps because it has a large deletion, but I don't see that.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation leads to a nonfunctional gene product through a nonsense mutation, but I don't see any in the given sequences.

Wait, another approach: the question is about an anti-nutritional compound. The gene is responsible for its synthesis. So, if the gene is knocked out (nonfunctional), the compound won't be made.

So, which mutation disrupts the gene's function the most?

A nonsense mutation (stop codon) would result in a truncated protein, possibly nonfunctional. But if the stop codon is early, the protein may not be functional.

But in the sequences given, none of the mutants have a stop codon introduced in the middle. So perhaps the correct answer is the one where the mutation causes a frameshift, leading to a stop codon.

Wait, but all the mutations are substitutions. So no frameshift. So maybe the only way is a nonsense mutation, but none of the options have that.

Wait, but perhaps I'm missing a stop codon. Let me check each mutant's sequence again.

Mutant4's sequence:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Let me look for any TGA, TAG, or TAA in the middle.

Looking at the part after ATG:

TTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Looking for TGA: the original ends with TGA, but in Mutant4, the sequence is ...TGAACATAT... So, after TGA comes A, which is part of the next codon.

Wait, the original's sequence has ...TGT CGT ...TGA.

Mutant4's sequence: ...TGT CGT ...TGA.

So, same as original, no early stop.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it has a large deletion that causes a frameshift, leading to a stop codon. But I don't see a frameshift in the given sequences.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects that a substitution at a critical site would disrupt the enzyme's function. But without knowing the gene's function, it's hard to tell.

Wait, another approach: the question states that the gene has five exons and four introns. So, the first exon is the beginning. If a mutation in the first exon disrupts the start codon or the initial exons, the gene may not be expressed correctly.

Looking at the sequences, the first codon is ATG (start) in all mutants. So the start is intact.

Another thought: perhaps the mutation creates a new splice site, leading to an alternative splicing that produces a nonfunctional mRNA. But the question states that the mutations are in the first exon area, so perhaps this isn't the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation creates a premature stop codon in the first exon, which would lead to a truncated protein.

Looking for TGA, TAG, TAA in the first exon.

In Mutant4, the sequence after ATG is TT TTA CGC TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TAT TGT CGT …TGA.

Breaking into codons:

ATG, TTT, TTT, TAC, GCT, ACT, TCT, GTG, GAT, GAA, CAT, ATA, TTT, TGT, CGT, TGA.

So, no stop codon until the end. So, the protein is still full-length but with some substitutions.

Wait, but perhaps in Mutant4, the sequence leading to the stop codon is altered. Let me see: the original ends with ...TGT CGT …TGA.

Mutant4's sequence ends similarly: ...TGT CGT …TGA.

So, same.

Hmm. Given all this, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4, because it has the most changes in the early exons, perhaps leading to a nonfunctional protein despite not introducing a stop codon.

Alternatively, perhaps a mutation that changes multiple amino acids in the beginning would disrupt the function more.

Looking at the amino acid changes:

Mutant1: Ala → Arg (position 4)
Mutant2: Ala → Ser (position4)
Mutant3: Ala → Arg (position4), Gly → Trp (position5)
Mutant4: Ala → Arg (position4), Gly → Tyr (position5)

So, Mutant3 and 4 have two substitutions, while 1 and 2 have one.

Perhaps two substitutions are more likely to disrupt the protein function.

But without knowing which amino acids are critical, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4, as it has the most changes in the early part.

Wait, but looking at the sequences, Mutant4 has a longer stretch of changes.

Wait, in Mutant4, the sequence after ATG is TT TTA CGC TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

So, in Mutant4, after ATG, the next codons are TTT (Phe), TTA (Leu), CGC (Arg), TAC (Tyr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), etc.

So, the initial amino acids are M, Phe, Leu, Arg, Tyr, Ser, Val, Asp, Glu...

In the original, they are M, Phe, Leu, Ala, Gly, Thr, Ser, Val, Asp, Glu...

So, in Mutant4, the fourth and fifth amino acids are changed to Arg and Tyr, whereas in the original, they were Ala and Gly.

Perhaps these changes disrupt a crucial part of the protein structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant1, which changes Ala to Arg. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the question asks which mutation will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. That implies that the gene product is responsible for synthesizing it, so disrupting the gene would stop production.

The most effective disruption would be a frameshift leading to a premature stop codon. But since all mutations are substitutions, none cause frameshift.

So, the next best is a nonsense mutation (stop codon). But none of the mutants have that.

So, perhaps the correct answer is the one where a stop codon is introduced, but I don't see any.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine Mutant4's sequence.

Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Breaking into codons:

1: ATG (M)
2: TTT (Phe)
3: TTT (Phe)
4: TAC (Tyr)
5: GCT (Ala)
6: ACT (Thr)
7: TCT (Ser)
8: GTG (Val)
9: GAT (Asp)
10: GAA (Glu)
11: CAT (His)
12: ATA (Ile)
13: TTT (Phe)
14: TGT (Cys)
15: CGT (Arg)
16: TGA (stop)

Wait, the 16th codon is TGA, which is the stop codon. But in the original, the stop codon is at the end as well.

Wait, but in the given sequences, it's hard to see where the stop codon is.

Wait, perhaps in Mutant4, the stop codon is earlier.

Looking at Mutant4's sequence:

...TGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

So, the last part is TGA, which is the stop codon. So, no stop in the middle.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me think about the options again.

The question is which mutation would eliminate the compound. So, the correct mutation must disrupt the gene's function.

If a mutation leads to a premature stop codon, the protein would be shorter and likely nonfunctional.

But in the given sequences, none have a stop codon in the middle.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the sequences. Let me look again. Perhaps one of the mutants has a TAA, TAG, or TGA earlier.

Looking at Mutant4's sequence: ...TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TAT TGT CGT ...TGA.

After GAA comes CAA (Gln), then TAT (Tyr), TAT (Tyr), TGT (Cys), CGT (Arg), then TGA.

No stop codons in the middle.

So, perhaps none of the mutations introduce a stop codon, so the only way is through a missense mutation that disrupts the protein's function.

In that case, which mutation causes the most significant change?

Mutant4 has two substitutions: Ala → Arg and Gly → Tyr. So, two changes in a row. That might disrupt the structure more.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because a large segment is missing, causing a frameshift, but I don't see that.

Wait, but all the given options are substitution mutations. So, perhaps the answer is the one where a key amino acid is changed, leading to a nonfunctional enzyme.

If the first exon is the beginning of the protein, perhaps disrupting the initial structure would be more effective.

In that case, Mutant4 has the most changes in the early part, so it's more likely to disrupt the function.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to analyze how each mutation affects the gene's function. The anti-nutritional compound is synthesized by the gene in question, so disrupting the gene's function would stop its production. This can occur if the mutation introduces a premature stop codon (nonsense mutation) or alters critical amino acids in the protein (missense mutation), rendering the protein nonfunctional.

### Key Analysis of Each Mutant:

1. **Mutant 1**:
   - Sequence: `ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`
   - Codon Changes:
     - Original: `CTC GCT` (Leu Ala)
     - Mutant: `CTA CGC` (Leu Arg)
   - Amino Acid Changes:
     - Ala (position 4) → Arg
   - No premature stop codons introduced. The substitution alters one amino acid, which may disrupt the protein but does not guarantee complete loss of function.

2. **Mutant 2**:
   - Sequence: `ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`
   - Codon Changes:
     - Original: `CTC GCT` (Leu Ala)
     - Mutant: `CTA AGC` (Leu Ser)
   - Amino Acid Changes:
     - Ala (position 4) → Ser
   - No premature stop codons introduced. This mutation also causes a substitution but does not necessarily disrupt the protein more significantly than Mutant 1.

3. **Mutant 3**:
   - Sequence: `ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`
   - Codon Changes:
     - Original: `CTC GCT GGT` (Leu Ala Gly)
     - Mutant: `CTA CGC TGG` (Leu Arg Trp)
   - Amino Acid Changes:
     - Ala (position 4) → Arg
     - Gly (position 5) → Trp
   - No premature stop codons introduced. This mutation introduces two substitutions in a row, which may disrupt the protein's structure or function more significantly than single substitutions.

4. **Mutant 4**:
   - Sequence: `ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`
   - Codon Changes:
     - Original: `CTC GCT GGT ACT` (Leu Ala Gly Thr)
     - Mutant: `CTA CGC TAC TCT` (Leu Arg Tyr Ser)
   - Amino Acid Changes:
     - Ala (position 4) → Arg
     - Gly (position 5) → Tyr
     - Thr (position 6) → Ser
   - No premature stop codons introduced. This mutation introduces three substitutions in a row, significantly altering the early part of the protein. These changes are more likely to disrupt the protein's function compared to the other mutants.

### Conclusion:
None of the mutations introduce a premature stop codon, so the most likely way to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound is through a missense mutation that significantly disrupts the protein's function. Mutant 4 introduces the most changes in the early part of the protein, making it the most likely to render the gene nonfunctional.

**Answer: D**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I need to figure out which mutant would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. Let's break it down step by step.

The question is about a barley cultivar that's drought-resistant but has this anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible has five exons and four introns. The researcher used EMS mutagenesis and found changes in the first exon. I need to determine which mutation would likely stop the compound from being synthesized.

First, I remember that exons are the coding regions of the gene, so mutations there can affect the protein product. The anti-nutritional compound is probably a product of this gene, so if the gene's function is disrupted, the compound won't be made.

Looking at the options, each mutant has a different change in the first exon. I think I need to look at the DNA sequences to see what kind of mutations they are and how they might affect the protein.

The intact gene's first part is: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So comparing, the 4th position in the original is C, but in Mutant 1 it's T. Let me count the letters:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT …
Mutant 1: ATG TT CT ACG CTG GTA CT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC …

Wait, maybe I should look at the exact changes. Let me write the first part:

Original (positions 1-20 maybe? Let's see):

1-20: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACT

Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACT

So position 4: Original is T, mutant is C? Wait, perhaps I should compare each position.

Wait, original starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

Mutant 1: ATG TTCTACGCTGGTACT...

Wait, perhaps it's easier to look for where the changes are. The problem states that the changes are at the beginning of the sequence in the first exon area.

Let me compare each mutant to the original.

Original: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Let's look at each mutant:

Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So, the original's first few nucleotides are ATG TTT CTC GCT G... 
Mutant 1: ATG TTCTACGCTG...

Wait, perhaps comparing each change:

Original: positions 1-20 (approx):

1: A
2: T
3: G
4: T
5: T
6: C
7: T
8: C
9: G
10: C
11: T
12: G
13: G
14: T
15: A
16: C
17: T
18: T
19: C
20: G

Wait, perhaps I should write the original and mutants' sequences in a way that the differences are clear.

Original: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Comparing, in the first part:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT …

Mutant 1: ATG TTCTACGCTGGTACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC …

Hmm, looking at the first part, the original has TTTCTCGCT, and mutant 1 has TTCTACGCT. So, it's a substitution from CTCG to TACG?

Wait, perhaps it's a substitution of a triplet. Let me check the exact positions.

Let me number the nucleotides:

Original: positions 1-20 (each letter is a position).

1: A
2: T
3: G
4: T
5: T
6: C
7: T
8: C
9: G
10: C
11: T
12: G
13: G
14: T
15: A
16: C
17: T
18: T
19: C
20: G

Mutant 1: positions 1-20:

1: A
2: T
3: G
4: T
5: T
6: C
7: T
8: A
9: C
10: G
11: C
12: T
13: G
14: T
15: A
16: C
17: T
18: T
19: C
20: G

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me see: the original's 6th base is C. In Mutant 1, the 6th is C as well. Wait, perhaps I should look for where the change is.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to look for the exact point where each mutant differs.

Looking at Mutant 1's sequence:

Original: ...CTCGCTGGTACT...
Mutant 1: ...CTACGCTGGTACT...

So the original has "CTC GCT", and the mutant has "CTA CGC". Wait, so is it a change from CTC to CT A? No, wait, perhaps the original is CTC GCT, which is positions 6-10: C T C G C T?

Wait, maybe I should align them:

Original (positions 5-10): T C T C G C

Mutant 1: T C A C G C

So positions 8 and 9 in the original are C and G, but in mutant 1, it's A and C? Not sure. Maybe I should look for the exact difference.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for how each mutation affects the amino acid sequence. Because a mutation that changes the amino acid could potentially disrupt the function of the protein, such as creating a premature stop codon or altering the active site.

The original sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon (methionine). Then, the next codons are TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), etc.

Let me write the original and each mutant's first few codons.

Original:
ATG (M)
TTT (Phe)
CTC (Leu)
GCT (Ala)
GGT (Gly)
ACT (Thr)
TCT (Ser)
GTG (Val)
GAT (Asp)
GAA (Glu)
CAT (His)
ATA (Ile)
TTT (Phe)
TGT (Cys)
CGT (Arg)
... 

Mutant 1:
ATG (M)
TTT (Phe)
CTC (Leu)
GCT → Wait, original has GCT, but mutant 1 has GCT? Or maybe the change is elsewhere. Wait, the first part of Mutant 1 is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACT...

So, breaking into codons:
ATG (M)
TTT (Phe)
CTA (Leu) [since CTA is Leu]
CGC (Arg)
GCT (Ala)
GGT (Gly)
ACT (Thr)
TCT (Ser)
GTG (Val)
GAT (Asp)
GAA (Glu)
CAT (His)
ATA (Ile)
TTT (Phe)
TGT (Cys)
CGC (Arg)
...

Wait, so the original has "CTC GCT" which is Leu Ala, and Mutant 1 has "CTA CGC" which is Leu Arg. So the third codon (position 7-9) changes from GCT (Ala) to CGC (Arg). That's a substitution of amino acid from Ala to Arg.

So, in Mutant 1, the third codon is CGC (Arg). So the second codon is still Phe, third is Leu, fourth is Arg instead of Ala.

Hmm, that's a substitution but doesn't introduce a stop codon. So the protein might still be made, but with a different amino acid. Unless the substitution disrupts a crucial part of the protein.

Mutant 2:
5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Let me break this into codons:

ATG (M)
TTT (Phe)
CTA (Leu)
AGC (Ser)
TGG (Trp)
GTA (Val)
CTT (Leu)
GTG (Val)
GAT (Asp)
GAA (Glu)
CAT (His)
ATA (Ile)
TTT (Phe)
TGT (Cys)
CGC (Arg)
... 

So the original's third codon was GCT (Ala), and in Mutant 2, it's AGC (Ser). Wait, let me see:

Original: codons 3 and 4 are CTC (Leu) and GCT (Ala), so positions 7-9: CTC, 10-12: GCT.

Mutant 2: looking at the first part, it's ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACT...

Codons would be:

1: ATG (M)
2: TTT (Phe)
3: CTA (Leu)
4: AGC (Ser)
5: TGG (Trp)
6: GCT (Ala) → Wait, no, let me count:

Wait, the sequence is ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACT...

Breaking into triplets:

ATG, TTT, CTA, AGC, TGG, GTA, CTT, GTG...

So, positions 7-9 (third codon): CTA (Leu)
Positions 10-12: AGC (Ser)
Original had at positions 10-12: GCT (Ala).

So in Mutant 2, the fourth codon is Ser instead of Ala. So the protein has a Leu, then Ser, then Trp, etc. Again, substitution but no stop codon.

Mutant 3:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Breaking into codons:

ATG (M)
TTT (Phe)
TTT (Phe)
TAC (Tyr)
GCT (Ala)
GGT (Gly)
GTC (Val)
ACT (Thr)
TCT (Ser)
GTG (Val)
GAT (Asp)
GAA (Glu)
CAT (His)
ATA (Ile)
TTT (Phe)
TGT (Cys)
CGT (Arg)
...

Wait, let's count. Original:

Original: codons 2-4 are TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala).

Mutant 3's sequence is ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

So, codons:

1: ATG (M)
2: TTT (Phe)
3: TTT (Phe)
4: TAC (Tyr)
5: GCT (Ala)
6: GGT (Gly)
7: GTC (Val)
8: ACT (Thr)
9: TCT (Ser)
10: GTG (Val)
... 

So compared to original, the second codon is still Phe. Third codon in original was CTC (Leu), but in Mutant 3, the third codon is TAC (Tyr)? Wait, no, let's look again.

The original sequence after ATG is TTTCTCGCTGGTACT.

Mutant 3's sequence after ATG is TT TTA CGCTGGTGTCA...

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me line them up:

Original starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT ...

Mutant 3: ATG TTT TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC TT...

Wait, so the original's positions after ATG are TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

Mutant 3: TTT TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC ...

So codon 2 is same (TTT Phe), codon 3 is TTA (Leu), codon 4 is CGC (Arg), codon 5 is TGG (Trp), etc.

Wait, original codon 3 is CTC (Leu), and in Mutant 3, it's TTA (Leu) again. So same amino acid.

But codon 4: original is GCT (Ala), Mutant 3 is CGC (Arg). So that's a substitution from Ala to Arg. Also, codon 5 in original is GGT (Gly), and in Mutant 3, after CGC is TGG (Trp), so that's a substitution from Gly to Trp.

So, again, substitutions but no stop codon.

Mutant 4:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Let's break into codons.

ATG (M)
TTT (Phe)
TTT (Phe)
TAC (Tyr)
GCT (Ala)
ACT (Thr)
TCT (Ser)
GTG (Val)
GAT (Asp)
GAA (Glu)
CAT (His)
ATA (Ile)
TTT (Phe)
TGT (Cys)
CGT (Arg)
...

Wait, the original after ATG is TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG... 

Mutant 4's sequence: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

So, the first part:

ATG, TTT, TTA, CGC, TAC, TTT, TCT, GTG...

Wait, no, let me look again. The original is CTC GCT GGT ACT ... and Mutant 4 is CGCTACT...

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compare:

Original part: CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG ...

Mutant 4: CGC TAC TCT ...

Wait, perhaps the codons are:

After ATG TTT:

Original: CTC (Leu) GCT (Ala) GGT (Gly) ACT (Thr) TCT (Ser) GTG (Val) ...

Mutant4: CGC (Arg) TAC (Tyr) TCT (Ser) GTG (Val) ...

So, the first few codons after ATG TTT are:

Original: CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val)

Mutant4: CGC (Arg), TAC (Tyr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), ...

Wait, no, the original and mutant4 sequences:

Original: ...CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGG...

Mutant4: ...CGCTACTTCTGTGG...

So, after ATG TTT, the original is CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant4: CGC TAC TCT GTG GAT...

So when broken into codons:

Original:
ATG (M)
TTT (Phe)
CTC (Leu)
GCT (Ala)
GGT (Gly)
ACT (Thr)
TCT (Ser)
GTG (Val)
GAT (Asp)
...

Mutant4:
ATG (M)
TTT (Phe)
CTC (Leu)
GCT → wait, no, let me see:

Wait, the sequence for mutant4 is ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGAT...

So after ATG TTT, the next is TAC GCT ACT TCT...

Wait, maybe the first few codons are:

ATG (M)
TTT (Phe)
TTT (Phe)
TAC (Tyr)
GCT (Ala)
ACT (Thr)
TCT (Ser)
GTG (Val)
GAT (Asp)
...

Wait, so let me see:

1-3: ATG (M)
4-6: TTT (Phe)
7-9: TTA (Leu)
10-12: CGC (Arg)
13-15: TAC (Tyr)
16-18: GCT (Ala)
19-21: ACT (Thr)
22-24: TCT (Ser)
25-27: GTG (Val)
...

Wait, original's first codons after ATG were TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), etc.

In Mutant4, the sequence after ATG TTT is TTA CGC TAC GCT ACT TCT ...

So, codons:

3: TTA (Leu)
4: CGC (Arg)
5: TAC (Tyr)
6: GCT (Ala)
7: ACT (Thr)
8: TCT (Ser)
9: GTG (Val)
...

So the original's codons 3 and 4 were CTC (Leu) and GCT (Ala). In Mutant4, codon 3 is TTA (Leu), codon4 is CGC (Arg), codon5 is TAC (Tyr), etc.

Wait, but when I look at the entire sequence for Mutant4, perhaps there's a frame shift or a stop codon. Because the question is about eliminating the anti-nutritional compound, which is likely due to the gene product. So if the gene is nonfunctional, the compound won't be made.

But in all the mutants, the exons are in the same reading frame? Or could there be a frameshift due to insertions or deletions? Looking at the sequences, I don't see any insertions or deletions. All the changes seem to be substitutions.

Wait, but looking at Mutant4's sequence: the original has more nucleotides in the first exon. Let me count the length.

Original starts with 20 bases: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Mutant4: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

So, the original's first part is longer? Or perhaps, in Mutant4, a part is missing.

Wait, perhaps the original has "GCTGGTACT" and mutant4 has "GCTACT".

Wait, perhaps in Mutant4, the 11th to 14th nucleotides are missing some bases, causing a frameshift.

Wait, let me compare the lengths.

Original: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant4: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Looking at the first part:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Mutant4: ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Wait, perhaps in Mutant4, the sequence after ATG is ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TCT ... So, codons:

1-3: ATG (M)
4-6: TTT (Phe)
7-9: TTA (Leu)
10-12: CGC (Arg)
13-15: TAC (Tyr)
16-18: TCT (Ser)
19-21: GTG (Val)
22-24: GAT (Asp)
...

Wait, original's codon 4 is GCT (Ala), but in Mutant4, codon4 is CGC (Arg), so it's a substitution.

But wait, the original had more nucleotides? Let me count the letters.

Original's first exon area: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Let me count the letters in the first exon. Let's see: the original's first part is 20 letters.

Mutant4's first part is ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

So, same length? Wait, maybe I'm miscounting.

Alternatively, perhaps in Mutant4, there's a deletion. Let's check:

Original sequence (first part):

After ATG, the next part is TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGG...

Mutant4's sequence after ATG is TT TTA CGC TAC TCT GTG GAT...

Wait, perhaps the original has a longer stretch. Let me count the letters:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TAT TGT CGT …
Mutant4: ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TAT TGT CGT …

Wait, in Mutant4, the sequence after ATG is TTT TTA CGC TAC TCT... So, perhaps in Mutant4, after the initial TTT, it's TTA CGC TAC TCT... but the original has CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

So, in the original, it's CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), etc.

In Mutant4, it's TTA (Leu), CGC (Arg), TAC (Tyr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), etc.

So, in the original, codons 4,5,6,7 are GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser). In Mutant4, codons 4,5 are CGC (Arg), TAC (Tyr), TCT (Ser), etc.

So, perhaps Mutant4's changes are substitutions but no frameshift. So, all the mutants have substitutions but no frameshift.

But the question is about which mutation would eliminate the compound. So, maybe a nonsense mutation (introducing a stop codon) would cause the gene to be nonfunctional.

Looking back at the sequences, are any of the mutants introducing a stop codon?

The original continues beyond the sequences shown, but let's look at the ends of the given sequences.

The original ends with ...TGA-3’ (TGA is a stop codon, but it's at the end of the mRNA, so it's the termination codon.

In the mutants, all have TGA at the end.

But the question is whether any of the mutations introduced a stop codon earlier.

Looking at the sequences in the first exon:

Original: ...CTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Mutant1: ...CTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…

Mutant2: ...CTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…

Mutant3: ...CTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Mutant4: ...CTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Wait, the original has ...TGT CGT... which is Cys Arg.

Mutant1: ...TGT CGC (Cys Arg to Cys Arg? Wait, CGT is Arg; CGC is also Arg.

Wait, looking at the specific parts.

Original: ...TGT CGT... (Cys Arg)
Mutant1: ...TGT CGC (Cys Arg)
Same amino acids, since CGT and CGC are both Arg.

Mutant2: same as Mutant1 in this region.

But wait, looking at the middle of the sequences:

In Mutant4, the sequence is ...TAC TCT GTG GAT...

Hmm, I'm not seeing any stop codons introduced in the middle of the sequences shown.

Wait, let me check the codons again.

Original's first part: ...TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Mutant1: ...TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Mutant2: ...TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Mutant3: ...TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Mutant4: ...TCT GTG GAT GAA...

So, in the middle, none of the mutations seem to introduce a stop codon.

Wait, but what about the original and mutant sequences beyond what's shown? Like, maybe a mutation introduced a stop codon elsewhere. But since the problem states that the changes are at the beginning of the sequence, perhaps in the first exon, the rest is unchanged.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation leads to a frameshift, causing a premature stop codon downstream. But as I looked before, all the mutations are substitutions, not insertions or deletions, so no frameshift.

Wait, but maybe in Mutant4, the sequence is shorter, leading to a frameshift.

Wait, looking again at the lengths:

Original: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant4: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

So, the part after ATG is:

Original: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Mutant4: TTT TTA CGC TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Counting the number of nucleotides:

Original's first part: Let's take 24 letters after ATG.

Mutant4's first part: same number of letters? Or does it have a deletion.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to count the letters.

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TAT TGT CGT ...TGA.

Mutant4: ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TAT TGT CGT ...TGA.

So, the first part after ATG is TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Mutant4: TTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Hmm, it's possible that the Mutant4 has fewer nucleotides, but in the given sequences, the length seems similar. If there's a deletion, it's hard to see from the given info.

Wait, perhaps I should look for an in-frame stop codon. For that, any of the codons in the mutants must be a stop codon.

The stop codons are UAA, UAG, UGA. In DNA terms, that would be TAA, TAG, TGA.

Looking at the sequences:

Original has TGA at the end.

Mutant1: ...CGT…TGA.

So, in their sequences, the TGA is still at the end.

Are any of the mutations introducing a TAA, TAG, or TGA in the middle?

Looking at Mutant4's sequence: ...TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TAT TGT CGT ...TGA.

Wait, in Mutant4, the 13th to 15th codon is TAC (Tyr), then TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), CAA (Gln), TAT (Tyr), TAT (Tyr), TGT (Cys), CGT (Arg), and then TGA.

No stop codons in the middle.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Since the anti-nutritional compound is a product of the gene, disrupting the gene's function would eliminate it. So, which mutation would disrupt the gene's function?

Mutations that cause a frameshift would lead to a completely scrambled protein from the mutation point onward. But in our case, all mutations are substitutions, so the frame remains the same.

Substitution mutations can cause missense (no stop) or nonsense (stop codon) mutations.

Looking for any mutation that creates a stop codon early in the sequence.

Original: ...CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Mutant1: ...CTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…

Mutant2: ...CTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…

Mutant3: ...TACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Mutant4: ...TACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Looking for any TGA, TAG, TAA codons in the middle.

In Mutant4, looking at the middle, let's see:

Mutant4's sequence: ...TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TAT TGT CGT ...TGA.

Wait, the codon after TAC is TCT (Ser). Then GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), CAA (Gln), TAT (Tyr), TAT (Tyr), TGT (Cys), CGT (Arg), then TGA.

No stop codons in the middle.

What about Mutant3: ...TACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Breaking into codons:

TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), GTC (Val), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), etc.

No stop codons here.

Mutant2: ...CTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…

Codons:

CTA (Leu), AGC (Ser), TGG (Trp), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), etc.

No stop codons.

Mutant1: ...CTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…

Codons:

CTA (Leu), CGC (Arg), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), etc.

No stop codons in the middle.

Hmm, so none of the mutants in the given sequences have introduced a stop codon before the original TGA. So none of them would cause a truncated protein due to a premature stop.

But wait, perhaps in the middle of the gene, a mutation introduces a stop codon. For example, if in a later part of the sequence, a TGA appears.

But without the full sequence, it's hard to say. However, the question states that the changes are in the beginning of the first exon. So perhaps the mutations are in the first exon, but the rest of the gene is the same.

So, perhaps the correct approach is to find a mutation that disrupts the reading frame, but earlier I thought all mutations are substitutions, so no frameshift.

Wait, but wait: in the given sequences, perhaps one of them has a deletion or insertion that causes a frameshift, leading to a stop codon.

Looking back, all the mutants have the same length as the original? Or is there a change in the length.

Original starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’.

Count the letters in the first part: Original has more letters? Let me count the nucleotides.

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TAT TGT CGT …
That's 27 nucleotides (9 codons) after ATG.

Mutant1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TCT TGT GGA TGA A...
Wait, perhaps it's the same length. So substitutions, no frameshift.

So, perhaps the only way to eliminate the compound is to disrupt the gene's function through a nonsense mutation (stop codon) or a missense mutation that disrupts the protein's function.

But without a stop codon in the middle, perhaps a missense mutation that disrupts a critical part of the protein.

Which mutation would cause the most drastic change? Let's look at the amino acid changes.

Original amino acids:
Positions 1-10 (approx):

M, Phe, Leu, Ala, Gly, Thr, Ser, Val, Asp, Glu.

Mutant1:

M, Phe, Leu, Arg, Ala, Gly, Thr, Ser, Val, Asp.

Change at position 4 from Ala to Arg.

Mutant2:

M, Phe, Leu, Ser, Trp, Ala, Leu, Val, Asp, Glu.

Change at position 4 from Ala to Ser.

Mutant3:

M, Phe, Phe, Tyr, Ala, Gly, Val, Thr, Ser, Val.

Change from Phe to Phe (no change?), then Tyr, etc.

Wait, in Mutant3, the third codon is TTA (Leu), same as original's CTC (Leu), so same amino acid. Fourth codon CGC (Arg) instead of GCT (Ala). Fifth codon TGG (Trp) instead of GGT (Gly).

So, position 4: Ala → Arg; position5: Gly → Trp.

Mutant4:

M, Phe, Leu, Arg, Tyr, Ser, Val, Asp, Glu.

Change from positions 4 and beyond.

So, position4: Ala → Arg; position5: Gly → Tyr.

Wait, which of these changes would most likely disrupt the protein function?

It's possible that a change in the active site or a critical region would disrupt the synthesis of the compound. But without knowing the structure, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps a nonsense mutation (introducing a stop codon) is the best way to eliminate the compound. But looking at the given sequences, none of the mutants have introduced a stop codon in the middle.

Wait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the sequences.

In Mutant4, the sequence after ATG is TT TTA CGC TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA ... So, codons:

ATG (M)
TTT (Phe)
TTT (Phe)
TAC (Tyr)
GCT (Ala)
ACT (Thr)
TCT (Ser)
GTG (Val)
GAT (Asp)
GAA (Glu)
...

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me write the entire sequence for Mutant4:

Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Breaking into triplets:

1: ATG (M)
2: TTT (Phe)
3: TTT (Phe)
4: TAC (Tyr)
5: GCT (Ala)
6: ACT (Thr)
7: TCT (Ser)
8: GTG (Val)
9: GAT (Asp)
10: GAA (Glu)
11: CAT (His)
12: ATA (Ile)
13: TTT (Phe)
14: TGT (Cys)
15: CGT (Arg)
16: ... (continuing until stop)
17: TGA (stop)

So, in Mutant4, codon 4 is TAC (Tyr), codon5 is GCT (Ala), same as original's codon3. Wait, this might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the reading frame is shifted, but no, as it's substitutions.

Wait, perhaps the original's codon4 is GCT (Ala), and in Mutant4, it's GCT (Ala) as well. Hmm, no, the original's codon4 is GCT, and Mutant4's codon5 is GCT.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused again. Let me try another approach.

Which mutation is most likely to cause a frameshift? None, as all are substitutions.

Which mutation introduces a stop codon early in the sequence?

Looking again, perhaps Mutant4's sequence doesn't have a stop codon in the middle. So all the mutants have substitutions but not introducing a stop codon.

Hmm. Maybe the question is looking for a mutation that creates a stop codon in the first exon, thus truncating the protein early.

Looking at the sequences, does any of the mutations create a TAA, TAG, or TGA before the end?

In Mutant4's sequence, after the initial ATG, the codons are:

ATG (M), TTT (Phe), TTT (Phe), TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), etc.

No stop codons in the middle. Original's stop is at TGA.

Wait, but perhaps in Mutant4, the sequence after TAC is TCT, which is Ser, then GTG (Val), etc. No stop.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4, perhaps because it has a large deletion, but I don't see that.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation leads to a nonfunctional gene product through a nonsense mutation, but I don't see any in the given sequences.

Wait, another approach: the question is about an anti-nutritional compound. The gene is responsible for its synthesis. So, if the gene is knocked out (nonfunctional), the compound won't be made.

So, which mutation disrupts the gene's function the most?

A nonsense mutation (stop codon) would result in a truncated protein, possibly nonfunctional. But if the stop codon is early, the protein may not be functional.

But in the sequences given, none of the mutants have a stop codon introduced in the middle. So perhaps the correct answer is the one where the mutation causes a frameshift, leading to a stop codon.

Wait, but all the mutations are substitutions. So no frameshift. So maybe the only way is a nonsense mutation, but none of the options have that.

Wait, but perhaps I'm missing a stop codon. Let me check each mutant's sequence again.

Mutant4's sequence:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Let me look for any TGA, TAG, or TAA in the middle.

Looking at the part after ATG:

TTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Looking for TGA: the original ends with TGA, but in Mutant4, the sequence is ...TGAACATAT... So, after TGA comes A, which is part of the next codon.

Wait, the original's sequence has ...TGT CGT ...TGA.

Mutant4's sequence: ...TGT CGT ...TGA.

So, same as original, no early stop.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it has a large deletion that causes a frameshift, leading to a stop codon. But I don't see a frameshift in the given sequences.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects that a substitution at a critical site would disrupt the enzyme's function. But without knowing the gene's function, it's hard to tell.

Wait, another approach: the question states that the gene has five exons and four introns. So, the first exon is the beginning. If a mutation in the first exon disrupts the start codon or the initial exons, the gene may not be expressed correctly.

Looking at the sequences, the first codon is ATG (start) in all mutants. So the start is intact.

Another thought: perhaps the mutation creates a new splice site, leading to an alternative splicing that produces a nonfunctional mRNA. But the question states that the mutations are in the first exon area, so perhaps this isn't the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation creates a premature stop codon in the first exon, which would lead to a truncated protein.

Looking for TGA, TAG, TAA in the first exon.

In Mutant4, the sequence after ATG is TT TTA CGC TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TAT TGT CGT …TGA.

Breaking into codons:

ATG, TTT, TTT, TAC, GCT, ACT, TCT, GTG, GAT, GAA, CAT, ATA, TTT, TGT, CGT, TGA.

So, no stop codon until the end. So, the protein is still full-length but with some substitutions.

Wait, but perhaps in Mutant4, the sequence leading to the stop codon is altered. Let me see: the original ends with ...TGT CGT …TGA.

Mutant4's sequence ends similarly: ...TGT CGT …TGA.

So, same.

Hmm. Given all this, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4, because it has the most changes in the early exons, perhaps leading to a nonfunctional protein despite not introducing a stop codon.

Alternatively, perhaps a mutation that changes multiple amino acids in the beginning would disrupt the function more.

Looking at the amino acid changes:

Mutant1: Ala → Arg (position 4)
Mutant2: Ala → Ser (position4)
Mutant3: Ala → Arg (position4), Gly → Trp (position5)
Mutant4: Ala → Arg (position4), Gly → Tyr (position5)

So, Mutant3 and 4 have two substitutions, while 1 and 2 have one.

Perhaps two substitutions are more likely to disrupt the protein function.

But without knowing which amino acids are critical, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4, as it has the most changes in the early part.

Wait, but looking at the sequences, Mutant4 has a longer stretch of changes.

Wait, in Mutant4, the sequence after ATG is TT TTA CGC TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

So, in Mutant4, after ATG, the next codons are TTT (Phe), TTA (Leu), CGC (Arg), TAC (Tyr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), etc.

So, the initial amino acids are M, Phe, Leu, Arg, Tyr, Ser, Val, Asp, Glu...

In the original, they are M, Phe, Leu, Ala, Gly, Thr, Ser, Val, Asp, Glu...

So, in Mutant4, the fourth and fifth amino acids are changed to Arg and Tyr, whereas in the original, they were Ala and Gly.

Perhaps these changes disrupt a crucial part of the protein structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant1, which changes Ala to Arg. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the question asks which mutation will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. That implies that the gene product is responsible for synthesizing it, so disrupting the gene would stop production.

The most effective disruption would be a frameshift leading to a premature stop codon. But since all mutations are substitutions, none cause frameshift.

So, the next best is a nonsense mutation (stop codon). But none of the mutants have that.

So, perhaps the correct answer is the one where a stop codon is introduced, but I don't see any.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine Mutant4's sequence.

Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Breaking into codons:

1: ATG (M)
2: TTT (Phe)
3: TTT (Phe)
4: TAC (Tyr)
5: GCT (Ala)
6: ACT (Thr)
7: TCT (Ser)
8: GTG (Val)
9: GAT (Asp)
10: GAA (Glu)
11: CAT (His)
12: ATA (Ile)
13: TTT (Phe)
14: TGT (Cys)
15: CGT (Arg)
16: TGA (stop)

Wait, the 16th codon is TGA, which is the stop codon. But in the original, the stop codon is at the end as well.

Wait, but in the given sequences, it's hard to see where the stop codon is.

Wait, perhaps in Mutant4, the stop codon is earlier.

Looking at Mutant4's sequence:

...TGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

So, the last part is TGA, which is the stop codon. So, no stop in the middle.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me think about the options again.

The question is which mutation would eliminate the compound. So, the correct mutation must disrupt the gene's function.

If a mutation leads to a premature stop codon, the protein would be shorter and likely nonfunctional.

But in the given sequences, none have a stop codon in the middle.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the sequences. Let me look again. Perhaps one of the mutants has a TAA, TAG, or TGA earlier.

Looking at Mutant4's sequence: ...TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TAT TGT CGT ...TGA.

After GAA comes CAA (Gln), then TAT (Tyr), TAT (Tyr), TGT (Cys), CGT (Arg), then TGA.

No stop codons in the middle.

So, perhaps none of the mutations introduce a stop codon, so the only way is through a missense mutation that disrupts the protein's function.

In that case, which mutation causes the most significant change?

Mutant4 has two substitutions: Ala → Arg and Gly → Tyr. So, two changes in a row. That might disrupt the structure more.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because a large segment is missing, causing a frameshift, but I don't see that.

Wait, but all the given options are substitution mutations. So, perhaps the answer is the one where a key amino acid is changed, leading to a nonfunctional enzyme.

If the first exon is the beginning of the protein, perhaps disrupting the initial structure would be more effective.

In that case, Mutant4 has the most changes in the early part, so it's more likely to disrupt the function.


To determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to analyze how each mutation affects the gene's function. The anti-nutritional compound is synthesized by the gene in question, so disrupting the gene's function would stop its production. This can occur if the mutation introduces a premature stop codon (nonsense mutation) or alters critical amino acids in the protein (missense mutation), rendering the protein nonfunctional.

### Key Analysis of Each Mutant:

1. **Mutant 1**:
   - Sequence: `ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`
   - Codon Changes:
     - Original: `CTC GCT` (Leu Ala)
     - Mutant: `CTA CGC` (Leu Arg)
   - Amino Acid Changes:
     - Ala (position 4) → Arg
   - No premature stop codons introduced. The substitution alters one amino acid, which may disrupt the protein but does not guarantee complete loss of function.

2. **Mutant 2**:
   - Sequence: `ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`
   - Codon Changes:
     - Original: `CTC GCT` (Leu Ala)
     - Mutant: `CTA AGC` (Leu Ser)
   - Amino Acid Changes:
     - Ala (position 4) → Ser
   - No premature stop codons introduced. This mutation also causes a substitution but does not necessarily disrupt the protein more significantly than Mutant 1.

3. **Mutant 3**:
   - Sequence: `ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`
   - Codon Changes:
     - Original: `CTC GCT GGT` (Leu Ala Gly)
     - Mutant: `CTA CGC TGG` (Leu Arg Trp)
   - Amino Acid Changes:
     - Ala (position 4) → Arg
     - Gly (position 5) → Trp
   - No premature stop codons introduced. This mutation introduces two substitutions in a row, which may disrupt the protein's structure or function more significantly than single substitutions.

4. **Mutant 4**:
   - Sequence: `ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`
   - Codon Changes:
     - Original: `CTC GCT GGT ACT` (Leu Ala Gly Thr)
     - Mutant: `CTA CGC TAC TCT` (Leu Arg Tyr Ser)
   - Amino Acid Changes:
     - Ala (position 4) → Arg
     - Gly (position 5) → Tyr
     - Thr (position 6) → Ser
   - No premature stop codons introduced. This mutation introduces three substitutions in a row, significantly altering the early part of the protein. These changes are more likely to disrupt the protein's function compared to the other mutants.

### Conclusion:
None of the mutations introduce a premature stop codon, so the most likely way to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound is through a missense mutation that significantly disrupts the protein's function. Mutant 4 introduces the most changes in the early part of the protein, making it the most likely to render the gene nonfunctional.
