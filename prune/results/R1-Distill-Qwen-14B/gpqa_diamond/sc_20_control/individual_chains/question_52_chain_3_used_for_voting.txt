Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The question involves stars, specifically looking at their effective temperature and the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, right. I remember that when stars have spots, it affects their overall temperature and emission. But how does that tie into the ratio of these energy levels?

So, the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, that's a significant change. So when the spots are present, the star's photosphere is cooler overall.

The key part is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, without spots, the ratio is higher, and with spots, it's lower. And we need to find the factor by which this ratio changes.

I think this has to do with the Boltzmann equation, which relates the population of different energy levels in a gas under thermal equilibrium (LTE). The Boltzmann equation is something like (n_i / n_j) = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where n is the number of particles in each state, g is the statistical weight (degeneracy), E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, we're looking at two specific energy levels of Ti. Let's call them level 1 and level 2. The transition between them corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. But wait, the wavelength is given, but do I need it? Oh, maybe it's for determining the energy difference between the levels.

Wait, wavelength relates to energy via the relation E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light. So the energy difference between the two levels is E2 - E1 = hc/λ.

But the problem is about the ratio of the number of atoms in the two levels. So, the ratio R = (n1 / n2) where 1 is the lower energy level and 2 is the higher. Or maybe the other way around? Hmm, wait the ratio given is level 1 to level 2. So if the star is hotter, the higher energy level would be more populated because thermal energy is higher.

Wait, the question says that when the star has spots, the overall Teff decreases. So when the star has spots, the temperature is lower (5500 K) compared to when it doesn't (6000 K). Now, the ratio of Ti atoms in levels 1 and 2 decreases when the star has spots. So without spots, the ratio is higher.

Wait, the ratio R is (n1 / n2). If the temperature decreases, how does R change?

Let's think. The Boltzmann factor is exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Because E2 is higher than E1, the exponent is negative. So, R = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

If T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so the exponential term becomes smaller. So R would decrease as T goes down.

Wait, the problem states that when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower, which makes the ratio R (n1/n2) decrease. So when T is lower, R is lower. So the ratio decreases when T decreases.

But the question is about the factor by which R changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. So R_no_spots / R_spots = ?

Because when the star has spots, R is lower, so this factor will be greater than 1.

Let me set up the equations.

Let R1 be the ratio when the star has spots (Teff=5500 K), and R2 be the ratio when no spots (Teff=6000 K). The factor is R2/R1.

But wait, R = (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Assuming g1 and g2 are the same for both cases (since it's the same transition), then the ratio R is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Wait, but ΔE is E2 - E1, and since 1448 Å is the wavelength for the transition, we can compute ΔE.

But wait, the exact value may not matter because it's a ratio. Let's proceed.

So, R2/R1 = [exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ]

Because R is proportional, and since the g's are same, they cancel out.

Wait, no. Let me re-express:

R1 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

R2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So the ratio R2/R1 = exp[ (ΔE/(k) ) (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) ]

Wait, that's because:

R2/R1 = [exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ]

Which is exp[ (ΔE/(k)) (1/T1 - 1/T2) ]

Wait, let me compute that exponent:

= [ -ΔE/(k T2) ] - [ -ΔE/(k T1) ]

= ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T1) - 1/(T2) ]

Wait, let me get the numbers right.

ΔE = hc/λ.

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s.

c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s.

λ is 1448 Å, which is 1.448e-7 meters.

So, ΔE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) )

Compute that:

6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1.448e-7 m:

ΔE = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ 1.372e-18 J per photon.

But wait, for the Boltzmann equation, we need this energy in terms of per particle and per Kelvin.

But let's see: the exponent is (ΔE)/(k T), where k is Boltzmann's constant, 1.38e-23 J/K.

So, let me compute (ΔE) / (k T) for both T1=6000 K and T2=5500 K.

But considering that we're taking the ratio, perhaps we can compute the exponent (ΔE/(k)) * (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Wait, let's compute that.

Compute (ΔE)/(k) first.

ΔE = (h c)/(lambda) = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) = (1.9878e-25) / 1.448e-7 ≈ 1.372e-18 J.

So (ΔE)/(k) = 1.372e-18 / (1.38e-23) ≈ 1.372e-18 / 1.38e-23 = approximately 1.372e5 / 1.38 ≈ 1e5? Let me compute more accurately.

1.372e-18 / 1.38e-23 = (1.372 / 1.38) * 1e5.

1.372 / 1.38 ≈ 0.995 ≈ 1. So about 1e5.

Wait, 1e5 is 100,000. So (ΔE/k) ≈ 1e5 K.

Wait, that can't be right because K is in terms of energy per temperature.

Wait, maybe I made a calculation error. Let me redo the calculation.

ΔE = (6.626e-34 J·s) * (3e8 m/s) / (1.448e-7 m) 

= (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / 1.448e-7 

= (1.9878e-25) / 1.448e-7 

= 1.372e-18 J.

Now, k = 1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE/(k) = (1.372e-18) / (1.38e-23) ) = (1.372 /1.38) * 1e5 

1.372 / 1.38 is approx 0.995, so 0.995e5 ≈ 99,500 ≈ 1e5 K.

So (ΔE)/(k) ≈ 1e5 K.

Now, the exponent in R2/R1 is (ΔE/k) * (1/T1 - 1/T2) 

T1 is 6000 K, T2 is 5500 K.

Compute 1/6000 - 1/5500.

That's (5500 - 6000) / (6000 *5500) ) 

Wait, no. 1/6000 - 1/5500 = (5500 - 6000) / (6000 *5500) ) 

Wait, 1/T1 - 1/T2 = (T2 - T1)/(T1 T2 )

So (5500 -6000)/(6000 *5500) ) = (-500)/(33,000,000) ) 

Which is (-500) / 3.3e7 = approx (-5e2)/(3.3e7) ) = approx -1.515e-5.

So the exponent is (1e5 K) * (-1.515e-5) ) = -1.515.

So the exponent is approximately -1.515.

So R2/R1 = exp( -1.515 )

What's that value? exp(-1.5) is about 0.223. Wait, exp(-1.515) is a bit less than that. Let me compute it accurately.

Alternatively, I can compute ln(2.2) is about 0.788, but that's perhaps not helpful. Alternatively, using calculator-like approach:

e^(-1.5) ≈ 0.2231.

But our exponent is a bit less than 1.5: 1.515, so e^(-1.515) ≈ 0.220.

Wait, but what is the actual value of (1e5) * (1/6000 -1/5500 )?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate (1/T1 - 1/T2).

T1=6000, T2=5500.

1/6000 = approx 1.6667e-4.

1/5500 ≈ 1.8182e-4.

So 1.6667e-4 - 1.8182e-4 = -1.515e-5.

So (ΔE/k) = (1e5 K) as computed earlier.

So (ΔE/k) * (1/T1 -1/T2) ) = 1e5 * (-1.515e-5) )= -1.515.

So the exponent is -1.515.

So exp(-1.515) ≈ 0.220.

Wait, that would make R2/R1 = 0.220.

So the ratio R when no spots is R2, and when spots are present is R1.

Wait wait, no. Let me clarify.

Wait, R = (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

When T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so R increases.

So when T is higher (no spots, 6000 K), R is higher. When T is lower (spots, 5500 K), R is lower.

So R2 (no spots) is higher than R1 (spots), so R2/R1 is greater than 1.

But according to our previous calculation, R2/R1 is exp(-1.515) which is ~0.22. That can't be right because that would imply R2 is smaller than R1.

Wait, I must have gotten R2 and R1 mixed up.

Wait, no. Let me reevaluate.

R1 is the ratio when the Teff is 5500 K (with spots); R2 is the ratio when Teff is 6000 K (without spots).

So R1 = (n1/n2) at T=5500 K.

R2 = (n1/n2) at T=6000 K.

So R2/R1 = [exp( -ΔE/(k *6000) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k *5500) ) ]

Which is exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/5500 - 1/6000) )

Wait, because:

R2/R1 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T2) + ΔE/(k T1) ] )

= exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

So in this case, T1 is 6000, T2 is 5500.

So 1/T1 is 1/6000, 1/T2 is 1/5500.

So 1/6000 -1/5500 = (5500-6000)/(6000*5500) )= (-500)/(33,000,000) = -5e2 / 3.3e7 = -0.00001515.

So the exponent is (ΔE/k) * (1/6000 -1/5500 ) = (1e5 K) * (-0.00001515) )= -1.515.

So R2/R1 = exp(-1.515) ≈ 0.22.

Wait, that would mean that R2 is 0.22 times R1. But that's impossible because when T is higher, R should be higher, so R2 should be larger than R1.

Hmm, I think I'm getting the ratio backwards. Because R is n1/n2.

Wait, when T increases, the exponent term ( -ΔE/(k T) ) becomes less negative. So the exponential increases. So R increases with T.

So when T increases (from 5500 to 6000 K), R increases. So R2 (6000 K) is larger than R1 (5500 K).

Wait, but according to our calculation, R2/R1 is 0.22, meaning R2 is smaller than R1. That can't be correct. So where did I go wrong?

Ah, wait, perhaps I messed up the signs. Let me re-examine the ratio.

The ratio R2/R1 = exp(ΔE/k (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Because:

R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )
R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

So R2/R1 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T2) + ΔE/(k T1) ] )

= exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) / )

In our case, T1=6000, T2=5500.

So 1/T1 - 1/T2 = (5500 -6000)/(6000*5500) )= (-500)/(33,000,000 )= -0.00001515.

So exponent is (1e5 K) * (-0.00001515) )= -1.515.

So R2/R1 = exp( -1.515 ) ≈ 0.22.

Wait, but that would mean R2 is 0.22 times R1, implying R2 < R1. But that contradicts our expectation because R increases with T.

So I must have made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should have T1 as 5500 and T2 as 6000? Because the star without spots has higher T.

Wait, perhaps I got R2 and R1 mixed up. Let me define R_spot and R_nospot.

Let R_spot be the ratio when spots are present (5500 K), and R_nospot when no spots (6000 K).

Then R_nospot = exp( -ΔE/(k*6000) )

R_spot = exp( -ΔE/(k*5500) )

So R_nospot / R_spot = exp( [ -ΔE/(6000k) + ΔE/(5500k) ] )

= exp( ΔE/(k) (1/5500 - 1/6000) )

Because:

= [ -ΔE/(6000k) + ΔE/(5500k) ] = ΔE/(k) [ 1/5500 - 1/6000 ]

So (1/5500 -1/6000) = (6000-5500)/(5500*6000) )= (500)/(33,000,000) )= 5e2 / 3.3e7 = approx 0.00001515.

So the exponent is (1e5) * 0.00001515 = 1.515.

So R_nospot / R_spot = exp(1.515 ) ≈ 4.54.

Which is about 4.5, corresponding to option C.

Ah, that makes sense. So the factor is approximately 4.5.

So the correct answer would be option C.

To determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(g_1\) and \(g_2\) are the statistical weights of the levels, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature. Since \(g_1/g_2\) is constant, the ratio depends on the exponential term, which is sensitive to temperature.

The energy difference \(\Delta E\) is related to the wavelength of the transition by:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda},
\]

where \(h\) is Planck's constant, \(c\) is the speed of light, and \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}\). Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Next, we calculate \(\Delta E / k\), where \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 1 \times 10^5 \, \text{K}.
\]

The ratio of the populations at two temperatures \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\) (no spots) and \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\) (spots) is:

\[
\frac{R_{\text{nospots}}}{R_{\text{spots}}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Substituting \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\) and \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\):

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = \frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \times 6000} = \frac{500}{33,000,000} \approx 0.00001515.
\]

Thus, the exponent becomes:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = (1 \times 10^5)(0.00001515) \approx 1.515.
\]

The ratio is then:

\[
\frac{R_{\text{nospots}}}{R_{\text{spots}}} = \exp(1.515) \approx 4.54.
\]

This corresponds to a factor of approximately 4.5. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The question involves stars, specifically looking at their effective temperature and the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, right. I remember that when stars have spots, it affects their overall temperature and emission. But how does that tie into the ratio of these energy levels?

So, the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, that's a significant change. So when the spots are present, the star's photosphere is cooler overall.

The key part is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, without spots, the ratio is higher, and with spots, it's lower. And we need to find the factor by which this ratio changes.

I think this has to do with the Boltzmann equation, which relates the population of different energy levels in a gas under thermal equilibrium (LTE). The Boltzmann equation is something like (n_i / n_j) = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where n is the number of particles in each state, g is the statistical weight (degeneracy), E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, we're looking at two specific energy levels of Ti. Let's call them level 1 and level 2. The transition between them corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. But wait, the wavelength is given, but do I need it? Oh, maybe it's for determining the energy difference between the levels.

Wait, wavelength relates to energy via the relation E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light. So the energy difference between the two levels is E2 - E1 = hc/λ.

But the problem is about the ratio of the number of atoms in the two levels. So, the ratio R = (n1 / n2) where 1 is the lower energy level and 2 is the higher. Or maybe the other way around? Hmm, wait the ratio given is level 1 to level 2. So if the star is hotter, the higher energy level would be more populated because thermal energy is higher.

Wait, the question says that when the star has spots, the overall Teff decreases. So when the star has spots, the temperature is lower (5500 K) compared to when it doesn't (6000 K). Now, the ratio of Ti atoms in levels 1 and 2 decreases when the star has spots. So without spots, the ratio is higher.

Wait, the ratio R is (n1 / n2). If the temperature decreases, how does R change?

Let's think. The Boltzmann factor is exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Because E2 is higher than E1, the exponent is negative. So, R = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

If T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so the exponential term becomes smaller. So R would decrease as T goes down.

Wait, the problem states that when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower, which makes the ratio R (n1/n2) decrease. So when T is lower, R is lower. So the ratio decreases when T decreases.

But the question is about the factor by which R changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. So R_no_spots / R_spots = ?

Because when the star has spots, R is lower, so this factor will be greater than 1.

Let me set up the equations.

Let R1 be the ratio when the star has spots (Teff=5500 K), and R2 be the ratio when no spots (Teff=6000 K). The factor is R2/R1.

But wait, R = (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Assuming g1 and g2 are the same for both cases (since it's the same transition), then the ratio R is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Wait, but ΔE is E2 - E1, and since 1448 Å is the wavelength for the transition, we can compute ΔE.

But wait, the exact value may not matter because it's a ratio. Let's proceed.

So, R2/R1 = [exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ]

Because R is proportional, and since the g's are same, they cancel out.

Wait, no. Let me re-express:

R1 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

R2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So the ratio R2/R1 = exp[ (ΔE/(k) ) (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) ]

Wait, that's because:

R2/R1 = [exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ]

Which is exp[ (ΔE/(k)) (1/T1 - 1/T2) ]

Wait, let me compute that exponent:

= [ -ΔE/(k T2) ] - [ -ΔE/(k T1) ]

= ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T1) - 1/(T2) ]

Wait, let me get the numbers right.

ΔE = hc/λ.

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s.

c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s.

λ is 1448 Å, which is 1.448e-7 meters.

So, ΔE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) )

Compute that:

6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1.448e-7 m:

ΔE = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ 1.372e-18 J per photon.

But wait, for the Boltzmann equation, we need this energy in terms of per particle and per Kelvin.

But let's see: the exponent is (ΔE)/(k T), where k is Boltzmann's constant, 1.38e-23 J/K.

So, let me compute (ΔE) / (k T) for both T1=6000 K and T2=5500 K.

But considering that we're taking the ratio, perhaps we can compute the exponent (ΔE/(k)) * (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Wait, let's compute that.

Compute (ΔE)/(k) first.

ΔE = (h c)/(lambda) = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) = (1.9878e-25) / 1.448e-7 ≈ 1.372e-18 J.

So (ΔE)/(k) = 1.372e-18 / (1.38e-23) ≈ 1.372e-18 / 1.38e-23 = approximately 1.372e5 / 1.38 ≈ 1e5? Let me compute more accurately.

1.372e-18 / 1.38e-23 = (1.372 / 1.38) * 1e5.

1.372 / 1.38 ≈ 0.995 ≈ 1. So about 1e5.

Wait, 1e5 is 100,000. So (ΔE/k) ≈ 1e5 K.

Wait, that can't be right because K is in terms of energy per temperature.

Wait, maybe I made a calculation error. Let me redo the calculation.

ΔE = (6.626e-34 J·s) * (3e8 m/s) / (1.448e-7 m) 

= (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / 1.448e-7 

= (1.9878e-25) / 1.448e-7 

= 1.372e-18 J.

Now, k = 1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE/(k) = (1.372e-18) / (1.38e-23) ) = (1.372 /1.38) * 1e5 

1.372 / 1.38 is approx 0.995, so 0.995e5 ≈ 99,500 ≈ 1e5 K.

So (ΔE)/(k) ≈ 1e5 K.

Now, the exponent in R2/R1 is (ΔE/k) * (1/T1 - 1/T2) 

T1 is 6000 K, T2 is 5500 K.

Compute 1/6000 - 1/5500.

That's (5500 - 6000) / (6000 *5500) ) 

Wait, no. 1/6000 - 1/5500 = (5500 - 6000) / (6000 *5500) ) 

Wait, 1/T1 - 1/T2 = (T2 - T1)/(T1 T2 )

So (5500 -6000)/(6000 *5500) ) = (-500)/(33,000,000) ) 

Which is (-500) / 3.3e7 = approx (-5e2)/(3.3e7) ) = approx -1.515e-5.

So the exponent is (1e5 K) * (-1.515e-5) ) = -1.515.

So the exponent is approximately -1.515.

So R2/R1 = exp( -1.515 )

What's that value? exp(-1.5) is about 0.223. Wait, exp(-1.515) is a bit less than that. Let me compute it accurately.

Alternatively, I can compute ln(2.2) is about 0.788, but that's perhaps not helpful. Alternatively, using calculator-like approach:

e^(-1.5) ≈ 0.2231.

But our exponent is a bit less than 1.5: 1.515, so e^(-1.515) ≈ 0.220.

Wait, but what is the actual value of (1e5) * (1/6000 -1/5500 )?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate (1/T1 - 1/T2).

T1=6000, T2=5500.

1/6000 = approx 1.6667e-4.

1/5500 ≈ 1.8182e-4.

So 1.6667e-4 - 1.8182e-4 = -1.515e-5.

So (ΔE/k) = (1e5 K) as computed earlier.

So (ΔE/k) * (1/T1 -1/T2) ) = 1e5 * (-1.515e-5) )= -1.515.

So the exponent is -1.515.

So exp(-1.515) ≈ 0.220.

Wait, that would make R2/R1 = 0.220.

So the ratio R when no spots is R2, and when spots are present is R1.

Wait wait, no. Let me clarify.

Wait, R = (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

When T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so R increases.

So when T is higher (no spots, 6000 K), R is higher. When T is lower (spots, 5500 K), R is lower.

So R2 (no spots) is higher than R1 (spots), so R2/R1 is greater than 1.

But according to our previous calculation, R2/R1 is exp(-1.515) which is ~0.22. That can't be right because that would imply R2 is smaller than R1.

Wait, I must have gotten R2 and R1 mixed up.

Wait, no. Let me reevaluate.

R1 is the ratio when the Teff is 5500 K (with spots); R2 is the ratio when Teff is 6000 K (without spots).

So R1 = (n1/n2) at T=5500 K.

R2 = (n1/n2) at T=6000 K.

So R2/R1 = [exp( -ΔE/(k *6000) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k *5500) ) ]

Which is exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/5500 - 1/6000) )

Wait, because:

R2/R1 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T2) + ΔE/(k T1) ] )

= exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

So in this case, T1 is 6000, T2 is 5500.

So 1/T1 is 1/6000, 1/T2 is 1/5500.

So 1/6000 -1/5500 = (5500-6000)/(6000*5500) )= (-500)/(33,000,000) = -5e2 / 3.3e7 = -0.00001515.

So the exponent is (ΔE/k) * (1/6000 -1/5500 ) = (1e5 K) * (-0.00001515) )= -1.515.

So R2/R1 = exp(-1.515) ≈ 0.22.

Wait, that would mean that R2 is 0.22 times R1. But that's impossible because when T is higher, R should be higher, so R2 should be larger than R1.

Hmm, I think I'm getting the ratio backwards. Because R is n1/n2.

Wait, when T increases, the exponent term ( -ΔE/(k T) ) becomes less negative. So the exponential increases. So R increases with T.

So when T increases (from 5500 to 6000 K), R increases. So R2 (6000 K) is larger than R1 (5500 K).

Wait, but according to our calculation, R2/R1 is 0.22, meaning R2 is smaller than R1. That can't be correct. So where did I go wrong?

Ah, wait, perhaps I messed up the signs. Let me re-examine the ratio.

The ratio R2/R1 = exp(ΔE/k (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Because:

R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )
R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

So R2/R1 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T2) + ΔE/(k T1) ] )

= exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) / )

In our case, T1=6000, T2=5500.

So 1/T1 - 1/T2 = (5500 -6000)/(6000*5500) )= (-500)/(33,000,000 )= -0.00001515.

So exponent is (1e5 K) * (-0.00001515) )= -1.515.

So R2/R1 = exp( -1.515 ) ≈ 0.22.

Wait, but that would mean R2 is 0.22 times R1, implying R2 < R1. But that contradicts our expectation because R increases with T.

So I must have made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should have T1 as 5500 and T2 as 6000? Because the star without spots has higher T.

Wait, perhaps I got R2 and R1 mixed up. Let me define R_spot and R_nospot.

Let R_spot be the ratio when spots are present (5500 K), and R_nospot when no spots (6000 K).

Then R_nospot = exp( -ΔE/(k*6000) )

R_spot = exp( -ΔE/(k*5500) )

So R_nospot / R_spot = exp( [ -ΔE/(6000k) + ΔE/(5500k) ] )

= exp( ΔE/(k) (1/5500 - 1/6000) )

Because:

= [ -ΔE/(6000k) + ΔE/(5500k) ] = ΔE/(k) [ 1/5500 - 1/6000 ]

So (1/5500 -1/6000) = (6000-5500)/(5500*6000) )= (500)/(33,000,000) )= 5e2 / 3.3e7 = approx 0.00001515.

So the exponent is (1e5) * 0.00001515 = 1.515.

So R_nospot / R_spot = exp(1.515 ) ≈ 4.54.

Which is about 4.5, corresponding to option C.

Ah, that makes sense. So the factor is approximately 4.5.

So the correct answer would be option C.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(g_1\) and \(g_2\) are the statistical weights of the levels, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature. Since \(g_1/g_2\) is constant, the ratio depends on the exponential term, which is sensitive to temperature.

The energy difference \(\Delta E\) is related to the wavelength of the transition by:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda},
\]

where \(h\) is Planck's constant, \(c\) is the speed of light, and \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}\). Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Next, we calculate \(\Delta E / k\), where \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 1 \times 10^5 \, \text{K}.
\]

The ratio of the populations at two temperatures \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\) (no spots) and \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\) (spots) is:

\[
\frac{R_{\text{nospots}}}{R_{\text{spots}}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Substituting \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\) and \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\):

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = \frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \times 6000} = \frac{500}{33,000,000} \approx 0.00001515.
\]

Thus, the exponent becomes:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = (1 \times 10^5)(0.00001515) \approx 1.515.
\]

The ratio is then:

\[
\frac{R_{\text{nospots}}}{R_{\text{spots}}} = \exp(1.515) \approx 4.54.
\]

This corresponds to a factor of approximately 4.5. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
