Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with electromagnetism concepts, but I'll give it a shot. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The question is about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroid-shaped, with the symmetry axis along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a particular wavelength lambda. In the radiation zone, the power radiated per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and the angle theta from the z-axis. The maximum power is A, and they're asking for two things: the fraction of A radiated at theta = 30 degrees, and a possible form of the function f.

The options are A, B, C, D. Each option gives a fraction and a dependence on lambda. Let's break this down.

First, I remember that when charges oscillate, they produce electromagnetic radiation. The radiation pattern depends on the symmetry of the charge distribution. Since the charge distribution is spheroid and the oscillation is along the z-axis, the maximum emission should be perpendicular to the z-axis, but wait, no, wait. For a dipole antenna, maximum radiation is perpendicular to the dipole's axis, but I'm not sure if that applies here. Wait, maybe not. Wait, no, for a dipole, the radiation pattern is maximum at the equator, which is 90 degrees from the dipole's axis. So if the dipole is along z, then maximum power is at theta=90 degrees.

Wait, but the problem says the maximum power is A. So the question is, when they say maximum, what angle gives the maximum? For a dipole, maximum is theta=90 degrees. So if the question is about the fraction of A radiated at theta=30 degrees, that's less than maximum.

But wait, I'm not certain. Let me think about the radiation pattern. The dipole's radiation pattern in the far field (radiation zone) is given by the dipole antenna's radiation. The power per unit solid angle (or the intensity) is proportional to (sin theta)^2, where theta is the angle from the z-axis. So the intensity pattern is maximum at theta=90 degrees. So the intensity at theta=30 degrees is (sin 30)^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25. So the fraction of the maximum intensity would be 0.25 times the maximum. But wait, is the maximum A the maximum intensity, or is A the total radiated power?

Wait, the problem says: "the maximum power thus radiated is A." Oh, wait, reading the question again, the maximum power is A. Wait, but the function f is the power per unit solid angle. So the total power is the integral of f over all solid angles. Wait, but the question is about the fraction of A that is radiated at theta=30. So perhaps when they say A is the maximum, that's the maximum value of f. Or perhaps A is the total power, but that would be confusing because the options include different dependencies.

Wait, I think I need to clarify. The power per unit solid angle is f(lambda, theta). The maximum of this function is A. So A is the maximum value of f. Then, the total power would be the integral of f over all solid angles. But the question is, what's the fraction of A that is radiated at theta=30 degrees. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Wait, the question says, "the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle theta=30 degrees." So, perhaps A is the maximum power at some angle, and we're to find the fraction of A that's radiated at theta=30.

Alternatively, perhaps A is the total power. Wait, no, the question says "the maximum power thus radiated is A". So A is the maximum value of f. So, the function f has maximum value A. Then, the fraction of A at theta=30 degrees is f(theta=30 degrees) divided by A.

If f is maximum at theta=90 degrees, then at theta=30 degrees, f would be lower. Let me consider the radiation pattern for a dipole again. The intensity (power per unit solid angle) varies as (sin theta)^2. So at theta=90 degrees, sin theta=1, so f would be maximum, A. At theta=30 degrees, sin theta=0.5, so (0.5)^2 is 0.25. So f(theta=30) = 0.25*A. Therefore, the fraction is 0.25, which is 1/4. So that would make the fraction of A at theta=30 equal to A*0.25, so 25% of A.

So the first part of the answer is 1/4, as in option B or C.

Now, the second part is the possible form of f. What is the dependence of f on lambda? The function f is the power per unit solid angle. For an oscillating charge, the radiated power is related to the acceleration of the charge. I think the power radiated by an accelerating charge is given by the Larmor formula.

The Larmor formula is P = ( (q^2 a^2 ) / (6 pi epsilon_0 c^3) ). But wait, that's the total power. But in this case, f is the power per unit solid angle. So for a dipole radiator, the radiation is not isotropic. The power per solid angle (intensity) is proportional to (sin theta)^2, as I thought earlier.

But considering the dependence on the oscillation frequency, which is related to the wavelength lambda. Let me think about how the power per unit solid angle depends on lambda.

The frequency is related to the wavelength by c = f lambda, where f is the frequency. So lambda is inversely proportional to the frequency. Now, the acceleration a of the charge is related to the angular frequency. For a charge performing simple harmonic motion, a = omega^2 x_0, where x_0 is the amplitude. But omega is 2 pi f, which is 2 pi c / lambda (since f = c / lambda). So omega is proportional to 1/lambda.

So a is proportional to omega^2, which is (1/lambda)^2. So a^2 is (1/lambda)^4. Substituting into the Larmor formula, P is proportional to a^2, so P is proportional to 1/lambda^4.

But wait, that's the total power. The problem is about the power per unit solid angle. But the dependence on lambda comes from the a^2 term. So f(theta) would have the same lambda dependence as the total power, but scaled by the angular distribution.

So f(theta) is proportional to (sin theta)^2 * (1/lambda^4), because the total power is proportional to 1/lambda^4, and each direction contributes (sin theta)^2 of that.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. The Larmor formula gives the total power, which is proportional to a^2. For a dipole, the power per unit solid angle is (sin theta)^2 times (something proportional to a^2). So since a^2 is proportional to 1/lambda^4, the function f would be proportional to (sin theta)^2 * (1/lambda^4).

So f is proportional to (sin theta)^2 * lambda^(-4). Therefore, the function f would have a form like f(theta, lambda) = k * (sin theta)^2 * lambda^(-4). So the dependence on lambda is lambda^(-4), which would make the function option either A or C.

Looking at the options, option C is fraction 1/4 and lambda^(-4), which matches what I found. Option B is 1/4 and lambda^(-3), which would be if f was proportional to 1/lambda^3, but that's not the case because a^2 is 1/lambda^4.

So putting it together, the fraction is 1/4, and the function is lambda^(-4). So the correct answer would be option C.

The problem involves an oscillating charge distribution, spheroid in shape, with its symmetry axis along the z-axis. The charge distribution radiates electromagnetic waves at a wavelength \(\lambda\), and the power radiated per unit solid angle is a function \(f(\lambda, \theta)\). The maximum power radiated is denoted as \(A\), and the task is to determine the fraction of \(A\) radiated at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) and the possible form of \(f\).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Radiation Pattern**: For an oscillating charge distribution, the power radiated per unit solid angle follows the dipole radiation pattern, which is proportional to \((\sin \theta)^2\). The maximum power occurs at \(\theta = 90^\circ\), where \((\sin 90^\circ)^2 = 1\). At \(\theta = 30^\circ\), \((\sin 30^\circ)^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25\). Thus, the fraction of the maximum power \(A\) radiated at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) is \(1/4\).

2. **Dependence on Wavelength**: The power radiated by an oscillating charge is proportional to the square of the charge's acceleration, \(a^2\). Using the Larmor formula, \(a^2\) is proportional to \((1/\lambda)^4\), since the angular frequency \(\omega\) is proportional to \(1/\lambda\). Therefore, the power per unit solid angle, \(f(\lambda, \theta)\), depends on \(\lambda\) as \(\lambda^{-4}\). The angular dependence is already accounted for by \((\sin \theta)^2\), so the function \(f\) has the form \(f \propto (\sin \theta)^2 \lambda^{-4}\).

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: \(1/2, \lambda^{-4}\) — Incorrect, as the fraction of \(A\) at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) is \(1/4\), not \(1/2\).
- **Option B**: \(1/4, \lambda^{-3}\) — Incorrect, as the dependence on \(\lambda\) is \(\lambda^{-4}\), not \(\lambda^{-3}\).
- **Option C**: \(1/4, \lambda^{-4}\) — Correct, as it matches both the fraction of \(A\) and the \(\lambda\)-dependence.
- **Option D**: \(3/4, \lambda^{-6}\) — Incorrect, as the fraction of \(A\) is \(1/4\), and the \(\lambda\)-dependence is \(\lambda^{-4}\), not \(\lambda^{-6}\).

### Conclusion:
The fraction of the maximum power \(A\) radiated at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) is \(1/4\), and the function \(f\) has the form \(\lambda^{-4}\). Therefore, the correct answer is:
