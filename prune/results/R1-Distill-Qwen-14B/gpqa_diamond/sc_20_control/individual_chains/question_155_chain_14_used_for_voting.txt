Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me see what it's about. The question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x. Hmm, I remember that the uncertainty principle relates the variance in an observable to the expectation values of the operator and its square. So I think I need to compute the expectation value of P_z and then the expectation value of P_z squared. Then, the uncertainty would be the square root of the difference between those two.

Wait, but wait. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). And the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which makes sense because P_z is diagonal in its own eigenbasis. So the state is a linear combination of the eigenstates of P_z.

Wait, but in this case, the state is given in the basis of P_z, right? Because the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So each component of the state vector corresponds to an eigenvalue of P_z. Let me think. The P_z matrix is given as:

[ ħ  0    0 ]
[ 0  0    0 ]
[ 0  0  -ħ ]

So the eigenvalues of P_z are ħ, 0, and -ħ. So the basis vectors are |+z>, |0>, and |-z>, corresponding to these eigenvalues.

The state vector given is ( -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 )^T. So the components are the coefficients of each eigenstate. Let me write that down:

ψ = (-1/2) |+z> + (1/√2) |0> + (-1/2) |-z>

Wait, no. Wait, actually, the state is represented as a column vector in the basis of P_z's eigenvectors. So the first component is the amplitude for |+z>, the second for |0>, and the third for |-z>.

So ψ = ( -1/2 ) |+z> + (1/√2 ) |0> + ( -1/2 ) |-z>

Now, to find the expectation value of P_z, which is ⟨P_z⟩. Since ψ is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z, the expectation value is just the sum of the probabilities of each eigenstate multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues.

So the probabilities are the squares of the absolute values of the coefficients. Let's compute that.

The coefficients are -1/2, 1/√2, and -1/2.

So |a1|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Similarly, |a3|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. The middle coefficient is 1/√2, so |a2|^2 is (1/√2)^2 = 1/2.

So the eigenvalues are ħ for |+z>, 0 for |0>, and -ħ for |-z>.

So ⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = (1/4 - 1/4) ħ + 0 = 0. Wait, that's zero.

Wait, but wait a minute. The state is in the basis of P_z, so the expectation value would be the sum of |c_i|^2 times the corresponding eigenvalue. So:

⟨P_z⟩ = |c1|^2 * ħ + |c2|^2 * 0 + |c3|^2 * (-ħ)
So |c1| is 1/2, |c3| is 1/2, so:

⟨P_z⟩ = (1/2)^2 * ħ + (1/2)^2*(-ħ) = (1/4) ħ - (1/4) ħ = 0.

Hmm, okay. So the expectation value of P_z is zero.

Now, to find ⟨P_z²⟩, which is the expectation of P_z squared. Well, since P_z is diagonal in this basis, P_z squared is just the square of each eigenvalue in the diagonal. So same basis.

So ⟨P_z²⟩ would be (1/4) * (ħ)^2 + (1/2)*0^2 + (1/4)*(-ħ)^2. Which is (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So the variance is ⟨P_z²⟩ - (⟨P_z⟩)^2 = (1/2 ħ²) - 0 = 1/2 ħ².

The uncertainty ΔP_z is the square root of the variance, so sqrt(1/2 ħ²) = (ħ) / sqrt(2).

So the answer should be option B) ħ/sqrt(2).

Wait, but let me double-check. Because the given state is given as an eigenstate of P_x, but we're working in the P_z basis. So the state is already expressed in the basis where P_z is diagonal, so the expectation is straightforward.

Alternatively, could I have messed up the calculation? Let me recheck the coefficients.

The state is (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). So c1 = -1/2, c2 = 1/√2, c3 = -1/2.

|c1|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

|c3|^2 is same as c1, 1/4.

c2 squared is (1/√2)^2 = 1/2.

So when calculating ⟨P_z⟩, which is sum |ci|^2 * eigenvalue.

But for c1, eigenvalue is ħ, c3's eigenvalue is -ħ.

So (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = (1/4 - 1/4)*ħ = 0.

Yes, that's correct.

Then ⟨P_z²⟩ is sum |ci|^2 * (eigenvalue)^2.

Which is (1/4)(ħ^2) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(ħ^2) = 1/2 ħ^2.

Variance is 1/2 ħ^2.

Square root is (ħ)/sqrt(2).

So option B is the answer.

To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we start by calculating the expectation values $\langle P_z \rangle$ and $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$. The system is in the eigenstate of $P_x$ with eigenvalue $-\hbar$, and the state is given as the column vector $\psi = (-1/2, 1/\sqrt{2}, -1/2)^T$. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$, corresponding to eigenvalues $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$.

### Step 1: Expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state $\psi$ is expressed in the eigenbasis of $P_z$, so the expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is the weighted sum of the eigenvalues of $P_z$, where the weights are the probabilities $|c_i|^2$ (squares of the absolute values of the coefficients in $\psi$). The coefficients of $\psi$ are $c_1 = -1/2$, $c_2 = 1/\sqrt{2}$, and $c_3 = -1/2$. The probabilities are:

\[
|c_1|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad |c_2|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad |c_3|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$ for the corresponding basis states. Thus, the expectation value is:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = |c_1|^2 \cdot \hbar + |c_2|^2 \cdot 0 + |c_3|^2 \cdot (-\hbar) = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is diagonal in the eigenbasis of $P_z$, with eigenvalues being the squares of the eigenvalues of $P_z$. Thus, the expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = |c_1|^2 \cdot (\hbar)^2 + |c_2|^2 \cdot (0)^2 + |c_3|^2 \cdot (-\hbar)^2 = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Variance and Uncertainty
The variance of $P_z$ is given by:

\[
\text{Var}(P_z) = \langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is the square root of the variance:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\text{Var}(P_z)} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$.
