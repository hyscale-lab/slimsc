Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here. Hmm, let me try to think through it. The question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field inside a sphere. Alright, let's break it down.

The vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r². So in spherical coordinates, it's only along the radial direction and its magnitude is 1/r². So f(r) = (1/r²) r̂, right? Because r̂ is the unit vector in the radial direction.

Wait, I remember that for such vector fields, like electric fields, the divergence theorem might come into play. But wait, the question is about the divergence of f, and the integral over the volume. Oh right! So the integral of the divergence of f over the volume is equal to the flux of f through the surface of the sphere, according to the divergence theorem. So ∫∫∫ (∇ · f) dV = ∫∫ (f · n) dA, where n is the outward normal vector.

But wait, maybe I should just compute the divergence first. Let me recall how to find the divergence in spherical coordinates. The divergence of a vector field A = A_r r̂ + A_θ θ̂ + A_φ φ̂ is (1/(r²)) d(r² A_r)/dr + (1/(r sinθ)) d(A_θ sinθ)/dθ + (1/(r sinθ)) (1/φ) dA_φ/dφ. But in this case, the vector field only has a radial component, so A_θ and A_φ are zero. So the divergence simplifies a lot.

So ∇ · f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² A_r). Since A_r is 1/r², let's plug that in. So A_r = 1/r². Then r² A_r = r² * (1/r²) = 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. Therefore, ∇ · f = (1/r²) * 0 = 0.

Wait, but that would mean the divergence is zero everywhere except maybe at r=0. But wait, for fields that are 1/r², like the electric field of a point charge, the divergence is zero except at the origin. So the integral over any volume that doesn't include the origin would be zero. But if the sphere of radius R is centered at the origin, then it does include the origin. Hmm, but the divergence is zero except at r=0, so does that affect the integral?

Wait, but in the divergence theorem, the integral of the divergence over the volume is equal to the flux through the surface. Let me compute the flux directly. The flux Φ is ∫∫ f · n dA. Since f is only radial and the surface is a sphere, f · n is just (1/r²) * r̂ · r̂ = 1/r². The surface area element dA is r² sinθ dθ dφ. So Φ = ∫∫ (1/r²) * r² sinθ dθ dφ. The r² cancels out, so it's ∫∫ sinθ dθ dφ.

The integral over θ is from 0 to π, so ∫ sinθ dθ = [-cosθ] from 0 to π = (-cos π) - (-cos 0) = (-(-1)) - (-1) )= 1 +1 =2. The integral over φ is from 0 to 2π, so ∫ dφ = 2π. Multiply the two, 2 * 2π =4π.

So according to the divergence theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to the flux, which is 4π. But wait, earlier calculation said the divergence is zero everywhere except the origin. So how does that fit? Oh right, because the divergence is zero except at r=0, but the flux isn't zero. So in reality, the divergence is a delta function at the origin. So the volume integral would only be non-zero if the region includes the origin, which it does here.

Wait, so the integral ∫∫∫ (∇ · f) dV is equal to the flux, which is 4π. But wait, when I calculated the divergence earlier, I found that it's zero everywhere except at the origin. So the integral would be the flux from the point charge, which is 4π. So the integral is 4π.

Looking at the options, option A is 4π. So the correct answer should be A.

The problem involves evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field \( \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{r}) \) inside a sphere of radius \( R \) centered at the origin. The vector field is purely radial and has a magnitude \( f(r) = \frac{1}{r^2} \). 

To compute the divergence of \( \mathbf{f} \), we use the expression for the divergence in spherical coordinates. Since \( \mathbf{f} \) has only a radial component (\( f_r = \frac{1}{r^2} \)) and no angular components (\( f_\theta = f_\phi = 0 \)), the divergence simplifies to:

\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 f_r \right).
\]

Substituting \( f_r = \frac{1}{r^2} \), we find \( r^2 f_r = 1 \). Taking the derivative of 1 with respect to \( r \) gives 0, so:

\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = 0 \quad \text{for all } r \neq 0.
\]

However, at \( r = 0 \), the divergence is singular, and the field behaves like a delta function centered at the origin. To evaluate the volume integral of \( \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} \), we use the divergence theorem, which relates the volume integral of the divergence to the flux of \( \mathbf{f} \) through the surface of the sphere:

\[
\int_V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f}) \, dV = \int_S \mathbf{f} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dA,
\]

where \( \mathbf{n} \) is the outward unit normal vector to the surface. On the spherical surface of radius \( R \), \( \mathbf{f} \) is radial and \( \mathbf{f} \cdot \mathbf{n} = \frac{1}{R^2} \). The surface area element in spherical coordinates is \( dA = R^2 \sin\theta \, d\theta \, d\phi \). Thus, the flux is:

\[
\int_S \mathbf{f} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dA = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^\pi \frac{1}{R^2} R^2 \sin\theta \, d\theta \, d\phi = \int_0^{2\pi} d\phi \int_0^\pi \sin\theta \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integrals evaluate to \( \int_0^\pi \sin\theta \, d\theta = 2 \) and \( \int_0^{2\pi} d\phi = 2\pi \). Multiplying these results gives:

\[
\int_S \mathbf{f} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dA = 4\pi.
\]

Thus, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to the flux, which is \( 4\pi \). Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:
