Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but let's try to think it through. The question is about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. I remember that in such a well, the energy levels are quantized, and each particle's energy depends on its quantum number.

Wait, the particles are spin-1/2, which means they're fermions, right? So they obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That's key because it affects how they fill up the energy levels. Since they're fermions, each quantum state can hold only one particle. But each state is characterized by the quantum number n and the spin. Hmm, but wait, in a one-dimensional box, the spin doesn't come into play for the spatial part of the wavefunction, right? So each spatial state can have two particles with opposite spins.

The well's length is L, so the energy levels are given by E_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²). And the problem says E is defined as pi²ħ²/(2mL²), so E_n = n² * E. That’s a helpful substitution.

Now, there are four particles. Let me list the energy levels from lowest to highest. The ground state is the lowest energy configuration. But because of the Pauli exclusion, the particles will fill up the lowest available orbitals, each with two particles (since each can have two spins).

Wait, in a 1D box, each n corresponds to a single orbital. Each orbital can hold two particles (spin-up and spin-down). So the first four particles would fill the lowest two orbitals, each with two particles.

So for four particles:

- The first two go into n=1 (each with opposite spins). So two particles here, contributing 1²E each. But since there are two particles, the total energy contribution is 2 * (1² E) = 2E? Or wait, no. Each particle in n=1 contributes E. So two particles would add 2E.

Wait, no, each particle in n=1 has energy E. So two particles in n=1 would be 2E.

Then the next two particles go into n=2. Each has energy (2² E) =4E. So two particles here would be 2 *4E=8E.

So the total energy for four particles in ground state would be 2E + 8E =10E. Hmm, wait, but wait—am I considering all possible states correctly?

Wait, maybe not. Because each n can hold two particles (spin up and down). So the order would be: fill n=1 with two particles (each E), then n=2 with two particles (each 4E), then n=3 with two, etc. But since we have four particles, n=1 holds two, n=2 holds two. So the total energy is 2E + 8E =10E for the ground state.

Wait, but wait again. The first energy level is n=1, with energy E. The second is n=2 at 4E. The third is n=3 at 9E, and so on. Each can hold two particles.

So four particles: first two in n=1 (2E), next two in n=2 (8E). So ground state has energy 2E +8E=10E? But wait, that's the total energy. So the ground state energy of the system is 10E. Hmm, but wait, the options don't have 10E as the ground state. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 30E,39E,50E

Option B:4E,10E,50E

Option C:4E,10E,15E

Option D:10E,15E,18E

Wait, the question is about the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. Oh wait, no, the question says calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in how the particles fill the states.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible states as each energy level being a separate state. So for four particles, how are the quantum numbers arranged.

Wait, the ground state is the lowest possible energy, which is all particles in the lowest possible orbitals, each with two particles.

So four particles would be two in n=1 and two in n=2. So the total energy is 2*(1² E) + 2*(2² E) = 2E + 8E =10E. So the ground state energy is 10E.

Wait, but wait again. Because each particle in the same orbital (same n) must have opposite spins. So for four spin-1/2 particles, the maximum number in the same n is two. So yes, 2 in n=1, 2 in n=2.

So ground state energy is 10E.

Now, the first excited state. What's the first excited state? It's the next possible configuration where the energy is just higher than the ground state.

So to get the first excited state, perhaps one of the particles in n=2 moves up to n=3. Because in the ground state, the configuration is (n=1)^2 (n=2)^2. To find the lowest possible first excited state, we promote the highest occupied particle to the next available orbital.

So, moving one of the n=2 particles to n=3. Now the configuration would be (n=1)^2 (n=2)^1 (n=3)^1. But wait, no, because each orbital can hold two particles.

Wait, no, in the ground state, we have two particles in n=1 and two in n=2. To get the first excited state, perhaps one particle from n=2 is promoted to n=3. So now, the configuration is two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3.

The energies would be: 2*E (n=1) + 1*(4E) (n=2) +1*(9E) (n=3). So total energy is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Wait, but that's 15E. But wait, is that the first excited state? Because maybe moving a particle from n=2 to n=3 is the first possible excitation.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when the two particles in n=2 are promoted to higher states in a way that the total energy is minimal.

Wait, but in the ground state, the four particles are in n=1 and n=2. The first possible excited state would be moving the last one from n=2 to n=3, giving a configuration of (2,1,1). So the energy is 2E +4E +9E =15E.

But wait, that's higher than the ground state. So the ground state is 10E, first excited is 15E.

Wait, but in the options, option D says the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, and second excited 18E.

But the question is about the system's energy. So ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, next would be when another particle is promoted.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, but the other stays. So the energy becomes 2E + (4E +9E) + 4E for the others. Wait, no, because we have four particles in total.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the possible states.

Wait, another approach: The total energy E_total is the sum of the energies of each particle. Each particle’s energy is n² E.

Because the particles are fermions, their wavefunctions must be anti-symmetric. But in a 1D box, the spatial part is symmetric or antisymmetric based on n. Wait, but I'm a bit confused about that. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the quantum numbers and spin as part of the overall state.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the possible filled states for four particles.

In the ground state, the lowest two n's are filled with maximum two particles each: n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles). So E=10E.

The first excited state: the lowest possible energy higher than ground state. So perhaps one of the particles in n=2 moves to n=3. So the configuration is 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, and 1 in n=3. So the energy is 2E +4E +9E =15E.

Wait, but wait a minute: each particle in n=3 contributes 9E, but there's only one particle there. So the total is 2*1E (n=1) +1*4E (n=2) +1*9E (n=3) = 2 +4 +9=15 E.

So the first excited state is 15E, and the ground state is 10E.

What about the second excited state? Next would be the next possible configuration. Perhaps another particle moves up. So now, you have two in n=1, two in n=3. Because in the first excited state, it was 2,1,1. Now, the next would perhaps promote the remaining n=2 particle to n=3, making two in n=3 and two in n=1.

Wait, but can we have two particles in n=3? Because each n can hold two, yes. So in that case, the configuration would be n=1^2 and n=3^2. The energy here would be 2*1E + 2*9E = 2E +18E=20E.

But wait, is 20E higher than the first excited state?

Wait, but perhaps that's the second excited state. Alternatively, maybe the second excited state is when two particles are promoted, but perhaps another configuration is lower. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the second excited state is when one of the n=2 particles goes to n=4. Wait, but n=4's energy is 16E; that would be even higher.

Wait, let me think again. The possible states are ordered by their energies. So after the ground state (10E), the next possible is 15E (2,1,1). Then, is the next configuration when n=2^2 and n=3^0? No, that's the ground state. No.

Wait, another way: Maybe the first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, giving 2,1,1. The next would be moving another n=2 to n=3, giving 2,0,2. So the energy would be 2*1E + 2*9E = 2 +18=20E.

But that's higher than 15E. So the order would be 10E (ground), 15E (first excited), 20E (second excited). But looking at the options, option D says the second excited state is 18E. Hmm, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the first excited state isn't just moving one particle. Let me think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is achieved by moving a particle from n=2 to n=3, but keeping another particle in n=2. So the total energy is 2*1E + 1*4E +1*9E= 15E.

Then, the second excited state could be moving another particle from n=2 to n=4. So particles in n=1^2, n=2^1, n=4^1. Energy would be 2*1E +1*4E +1*16E= 2+4+16=22E. But 22 isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3, giving energy 2*9E=18E, plus the two in n=1, which is 2E. So total 2E +18E=20E. But again, 20 isn't an option.

Looking at the options, the only option with 10E as the ground state is options B and D.

Option B says ground 4E, first 10E, second 50E.

Option D says ground 10E, first 15E, second 18E.

Wait, but our calculation for the ground state was 10E, first excited 15E, and second excited perhaps 20E, but that's not an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the ground state calculation. Let me go back.

The four particles are spin-1/2. In a one-dimensional box, each spatial state can hold two particles (because of spin). So the filling is as follows:

n=1: 2 particles.

n=2: 2 particles.

So the total energy is 2*(1^2 E) + 2*(2^2 E) =2E +8E=10E. So ground state is 10E.

So the options that have 10E as ground state are options B (ground 4E, no), and option D (ground 10E). So options B and D have 10E in their ground state or elsewhere.

Wait, option D says ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E.

So that would fit if the second excited state is when the configuration is n=3^2 and n=1^2, because that would be 2*9E =18E plus 2*1E, total 20E. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is something else.

Wait, perhaps when considering the possible excited states, the lowest possible would be moving one particle from n=2 to n=3, giving 2,1,1 (15E). Then, the next possible is moving another to n=3, giving 2,0,2 (20E). But 20E is not an option in D.

Wait, but option D says second excited state is 18E. 18E is 2*(3^2 E) → 2*9E=18E. So if the configuration is two particles in n=3 and two in n=1, that would require 2*(9E) +2*(1E) =20E, which is higher than 15E.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a configuration. Maybe the second excited state is when three particles are promoted, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the first and second excited states.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when a particle is excited from n=1 to n=2, but that can't be, because n=1 is already filled with two particles; you can't have more than two in n=1. So the next available is n=2. Wait, no, n=2 is already filled with two particles.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the possible states are determined by the possible partitions of four particles into the available n's, with each n holding at most two particles.

The possible partitions are:

1. (4): but each n can hold two, so this would require n=2, but 4 particles can't be in one n. So that's not allowed.

Wait, no, perhaps the possible partitions of four particles into n's considering each n can have up to two.

The possible partitions are:

- (2,2): n=1 and n=2 each have two particles. This is the ground state, energy 2E +8E=10E.

- (2,1,1): move one from n=2 to n=3. So two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. Energy: 2E +4E +9E=15E.

- (2,0,2): move both from n=2 to n=3. Energy:2E + 2*9E=20E.

- (1,1,1,1): each n=1 to 4 has one particle. But that's impossible because each n can hold two. So four particles would be each in a separate n, but that's only possible if four n's are filled with one each. But wait, no, because for four particles, each with their own n, you can have n=1,2,3,4 each with one particle. But that would require four n's. But can we have four particles each in different n's? Because each n can hold two particles, but for four particles, each n can have one, so n=1,2,3,4 each have one.

But wait, that's four particles, each in a unique n. But each n can take two, so that's allowed.

Wait, but in that case, the energy would be 1²E +2²E +3²E +4²E= 1E +4E +9E +16E=30E.

Wait, that's the configuration where each particle is in a separate n. So that's option A's first energy, which is 30E. But that's higher than the 20E from the (2,0,2) configuration.

But how does this fit into the excited states? Let me think about the available options.

The possible configurations for four particles are:

1. (2,2): 2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2. Energy 10E.

2. (2,1,1): 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3. Energy 15E.

3. (2,0,2): 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3. Energy 20E.

4. (1,1,1,1): 1 in each n=1,2,3,4. Energy 30E.

Are there any other configurations? For example, (0,2,2), which would be 2 in n=2 and 2 in n=3. That's 8E +18E=26E. Wait, that's higher than 20E but lower than 30E.

So among these, the energies are 10E (ground), 15E (first excited), 20E (second excited), 26E, 30E.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D says the second excited state is 18E. Hmm, which isn’t matching 20E. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, giving two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. So 2+4+9=15E.

Then, the second excited state is when another particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, resulting in two in n=1 and two in n=3. The energy here is 2*1E + 2*9E= 2E +18E=20E. So 20E is the second excited state.

But none of the options have 20E for the second excited state. Wait, looking again at the options:

Option A: 30, 39,50.

Option B:4,10,50.

Option C:4,10,15.

Option D:10,15,18.

So, in our calculation, the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 20E. But none of the options match this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in how the particles are filled. Maybe the first excited state is when a particle moves from n=1 to n=2, but that can't be because n=1 is already filled with two.

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Maybe the way the particles are filled is different because they're fermions and each state must be unique.

Wait, perhaps the particles fill their states based on the quantum numbers and spin. Let me think about the Pauli exclusion in terms of their quantum states.

In a 1D box, each state is uniquely determined by n and spin. So each n can have two states: spin up and spin down.

So for four particles, the filling would be:

n=1: spin up and down → two particles.

n=2: spin up and down → two particles.

That’s the ground state, energy 10E.

The first excited state would be the next possible state where one of the particles in n=2 moves to n=3. So n=3 would have one spin up (and empty spin down?), but no, each n can have two spins. So moving a particle to n=3 would require it to take one of the two spin states.

So the configuration is:

n=1: two particles (both spins).

n=2: one particle (one spin), n=3: one particle (one spin).

Wait, but each n can hold two, so n=2 now has one, and n=3 has one.

But for four particles, that's two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. So the total energy is 2*(1E) + 1*(4E) +1*(9E) =2 +4 +9=15E.

So that's the first excited state. Now, the second excited state would be when another particle moves from n=2 to n=3. So now, n=2 has zero, n=3 has two, and n=1 has two. So the energy is 2*(1E) +0 +2*(9E)=2 +0 +18=20E. So the second excited state would be 20E.

But none of the options have 20E. So perhaps I'm missing something about the possible states.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the second excited state isn't moving a second particle from n=2 to n=3, but instead moving a particle from n=3 to a higher n, but that would increase the energy further.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when a particle from n=1 is promoted, but that's not possible because n=1 is already filled.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me look at the options again.

Option D says the second excited state is 18E. 18E is 2*9E. So maybe that's when two particles are in n=3, and two in n=1. But that configuration would have energy 20E, not 18E. Hmm.

Wait, unless I'm miscalculating the configuration. No, 2*(9E)=18E, but plus two in n=1, which is 2E, so total 20E.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when a single particle is promoted from n=3 to n=4, but that would take energy from 9E to 16E, so adding 7E. So the new state would be 2 particles in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4. Energy: 2E +4E +16E=22E.

But 22E isn't an option either.

Hmm. Maybe I should consider that perhaps each particle can have a different n, but not necessarily filled up. So for four particles, the possible lowest energies would be:

Ground state: (n=1)^2, (n=2)^2 →10E.

First excited: (n=1)^2, (n=2)^1, (n=3)^1 →15E.

Second excited: (n=1)^2, (n=3)^2 →20E.

So three states are 10,15,20.

Looking at the options, none of them have 20E as the third state. So perhaps the question is considering the system's energy in a different way.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the possibility of having more than two particles in higher n's. Wait, no, that's not possible because each n can have two.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in considering the system's energy as the sum of each particle's energy. Let me verify that.

Each particle's energy is (n_i)^2 E, so the total is the sum of all n_i squared times E.

In the ground state:

Two particles in n=1 →2*(1)^2 E =2E.

Two in n=2 →2*(4) E=8E.

Total:10E.

First excited: two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3.

Sum: 2*1 +4 +9=15 →15E.

Second excited: two in n=1, two in n=3 → sum 2 + 2*9=20 →20E.

But none of the options have 20E as the third state.

Wait, looking at the options, option D says 18E as the second excited state. 18E is 2*9=18. But that would require two particles in n=3 and two in n=1, sum 20E.

Wait, unless the system's states are considered in terms of the sum of the squares of the quantum numbers. So, perhaps when particles are promoted beyond n=3, let's see.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the first excited state is when a particle is promoted from n=2 to n=4, but that would require a higher energy than promoting to n=3. So that's less likely.

Wait, let me see option D: ground 10, first excited 15, second 18. How could that happen?

If the second excited state is when particles are in n=1^2, n=2^1, and n=4^1. So sum would be 2*(1) +4 +16=22E. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and one in n=2, but that would require five particles, which isn't the case here.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible answers.

Wait, option B says the ground state is 4E, first excited 10E, second 50E. That seems unlikely because 4E would be two particles in n=2 (each 4E, but 2*4E=8E), but 4E is much lower.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the filling. Let me think again.

Wait, four spin-1/2 particles, so each can have two states. In a 1D box, the quantum number is n, and each n can hold two spins.

Wait, perhaps the way of filling is n=1, n=2, etc. But for four particles, the ground state would have two in n=1 and two in n=2, as I thought earlier.

So that gives 2E +8E=10E.

The first excited state would involve moving one of the n=2 particles to n=3, leading to 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Second excited state would have another particle moving from n=2 to n=3, giving 2E + 18E=20E.

So the energies would be 10E,15E,20E.

Looking at the options, none of them match this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the energies of the individual particles, but that doesn't make sense because the options give sums like 30E, which would be 1+4+9+16=30E, but that's four particles each in n=1,2,3,4.

Wait, but the question says, "energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system."

So the system's energy is the sum of all particles' energies.

If the ground state is (2,2) →10E.

First excited is (2,1,1):15E.

Second excited is (2,0,2):20E.

But none of the options have 20E. Wait, but option D says the second excited is 18E, which would be 2*9=18. So perhaps the second excited state is when two are in n=3 and two in n=1, giving 20E, but that's not in the options.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the first excited state isn't moving just one particle but involves a different configuration.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3 and another to n=4. So the configuration is (2,1,1,1). But that's four particles in n=1,2,3,4. So the sum is 1+4+9+16=30E. Which is option A's first energy.

But that would make the first excited state 30E, which is higher than 15E. So that can't be the first excited state.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and the others stay as in the ground state.

Wait, but that would require the configuration (2,2, 1?), but that's not allowed because each n can hold two.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4, but that's higher.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me look at the options again.

Option D: 10E,15E,18E.

So, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 (each 9E), and the other two in n=1 (each 1E). So total is 2*1 + 2*9= 2 +18=20E. But option D has 18E for the second excited state. So that's not matching.

Wait, unless I've made a mistake in calculating the sum.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the first excited state is when one of the n=1 particles moves to n=2, but that's already filled. So that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when a particle moves from n=2 to n=3, but I think that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when both particles in n=2 move to n=3, leading to (2,0,2). So the energy is 2*1 + 2*9=20E. But again, that's not in the options.

Hmm. Maybe the question is not about the sum of all particles but about some other aspect. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in how the particles are filled.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of possible state configurations and their energies.

The possible configurations and their energies:

1. (2,2): sum=2+8=10E → ground state.

2. (2,1,1): sum=2+4+9=15E → first excited.

3. (1,1,1,1): sum=1+4+9+16=30E → higher.

4. (2,0,2): sum=2+0+18=20E → second excited.

5. (1,1,2): sum=1+1+8=10E → same as ground state.

Wait, no, that's not possible because (1,1,2) would imply three n's, but with only three particles. Hmm, perhaps not.

Another possible configuration might be (2,0,1,1), but that would sum to 2+0+4+9=15E, which is the same as (2,1,1). So perhaps that's not a distinct state.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is (1,2,1), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4. But that would sum to 1+4+9+16=30E. But that's higher than 15E.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck, so perhaps I should check the options again.

The only option that starts with 10E is option D. It says the energies are 10E,15E,18E.

So perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4, but that would be 1+4+9+16=30E. But option D's second excited is 18E, which doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in considering the possible configurations. Maybe the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3, but that would require the configuration (2,0,2), which sums to 20E.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the energies of the individual particles rather than the sum, but that doesn't make sense for the system's energy.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the sum of the squares of the quantum numbers, but that doesn't change anything.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the possible energy levels for the system, regardless of the particle configuration, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, perhaps the ground state is not (2,2) but something else. No, that can't be right because two particles in each n=1 and n=2 is the lowest possible.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the particles are bosons, but the question says they're spin-1/2, which are fermions.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the options again and see which one fits the possible calculations.

If option D says the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second 18E.

How can 18E be achieved? 18E would be 2*9E, so two particles in n=3. But that requires two particles in n=3 and two in n=1. So sum 2*1 + 2*9=20E. So 18E can't be achieved.

Wait, unless in the second excited state, one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4, but that would be 9E +16E=25E, plus the two in n=1. So 2+9+16=27E, which is not an option.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when a particle is promoted from n=1 to n=3, but that's not possible because n=1 is filled.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when a particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, and another from n=2 to n=4. That would give two in n=1, one in n=3, one in n=4. The sum would be 2*1 +9 +16= 2+9+16=27E.

But again, not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and three in other states, but that seems unlikely.

Hmm. Another Approach:

Each particle must have a unique quantum state, so the possible states are filled as per the Pauli exclusion.

The lowest possible energies are when particles are in the lowest possible n's.

So for four particles:

n=1: 2 particles.

n=2: 2 particles.

So ground state energy: 2*(1² E) + 2*(2² E) =2E +8E=10E.

First excited state: promote one of the n=2 particles to n=3.

So now, n=3 has 1 particle.

So the sum is 2*(1) + (4) + (9) =2+4+9=15E.

Second excited state: promote another n=2 particle to n=3.

Now, n=3 has 2 particles.

Sum:2*1 +0*4 +2*9=2+0+18=20E.

So the energies are 10E,15E,20E.

Looking at the options, none have 20E as the third state. So perhaps the correct option isn't listed, but that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in the configuration.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the system's energy levels are ordered based on the sum of the quantum numbers, but that's not correct because higher n's have higher energies.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state isn't (2,0,2) but a different configuration.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=4. So the configuration is two in n=1, two in n=2, and zero elsewhere. No, that's the ground state.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the second excited state is when a particle is promoted from n=2 to n=4. So n=1 has two, n=2 has one, n=4 has one.

Sum:2*1 +4 +16=2+4+16=22E.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Maybe I should try to eliminate the options.

Option B: ground state 4E. How would that happen? 4E would be two particles in n=2, each 4E. But that would require four particles in n=2, which isn't possible because each n can have two. So two in n=2 would give 8E, not 4E. So option B seems incorrect.

Option C: ground 4E, first 10E, second 15E. The ground state 4E would be two particles in n=2, which would sum to 8E. So that's impossible. So option C is wrong.

Option A: ground state 30E, which would be each particle in a separate n=1,2,3,4. That's 1+4+9+16=30E. But that's a higher energy than the ground state because in the ground state, you can have more particles in lower n's.

So option A can't be correct because the ground state is 10E, as calculated.

That leaves option D as the only possible one, even though our calculation for the second excited state is 20E, which isn't in option D.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state isn't (2,0,2) but (1,1,1,1), which is 30E. But that's the highest energy.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in how the excited states are ordered.

Wait, the order of energies would be:

Ground state:10E →(2,2).

First excited state:15E →(2,1,1).

Second excited state:20E →(2,0,2).

So the energies are 10,15,20.

But none of the options match. Therefore, perhaps the correct option isn't present, but this can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. It says, "energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system." So, perhaps the system's energy is the sum, which is what I've been calculating.

Wait, but perhaps the question is asking for the energies in terms of E, but E is given as E=pi^2 hbar^2/(2mL^2). So each n^2 *E is the energy for that particle.

Wait, perhaps the system's energy is the sum. So for four particles, the ground state sum is 10E, first excited sum is 15E, second excited sum is 20E. But none of the options have that.

Wait, the only option that starts with 10E is option D:10,15,18.

But 18E is 2*(3^2 E) =18E. So perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=1.

Wait, that would make the sum 2*1 +2*9=20E. So perhaps option D is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3 and another to n=4. So the sum would be 2*1 +4 +9 +16=31E. But that's even higher.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Based on the options provided, the only one that makes sense is option D:10,15,18, but I don't see how that fits.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the second excited state. Maybe the second excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=3 to n=4, but that would require a higher energy.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4. So the sum would be 2*1 (n=1) +1*4 (n=2) +1*16 (n=4) = 2+4+16=22E. Still not matching.

Another possibility: the ground state is 10E, first excited is 15E, and the second excited is when two particles are in n=3, but that's 20E.

Wait, perhaps the question is wrong, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a more optimal configuration. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state isn't (2,0,2) but (1,1,2). But how many particles would that involve? n=1 has two (2E), n=2 has two (8E), which is the ground state. So that's not helpful.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Given the options, the only one that starts with 10E is option D. So perhaps the correct answer is option D:10,15,18.

But I'm not entirely sure how 18E is achieved. Maybe I should go with that.

The problem involves four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length \( L \). The energy levels of the system are quantized and given by \( E_n = n^2 E \), where \( E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2} \). Since the particles are fermions, they obey the Pauli exclusion principle, and each quantum state can hold at most two particles (one for each spin state). The goal is to determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Ground State Configuration**:
   - The lowest energy configuration occurs when the particles fill the lowest available orbitals.
   - Two particles occupy \( n=1 \) (each contributing \( E \)), and two particles occupy \( n=2 \) (each contributing \( 4E \)).
   - Total energy: \( 2E + 8E = 10E \).

2. **First Excited State Configuration**:
   - The first excited state is obtained by promoting one particle from \( n=2 \) to \( n=3 \).
   - The configuration becomes: two particles in \( n=1 \), one particle in \( n=2 \), and one particle in \( n=3 \).
   - Total energy: \( 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E \).

3. **Second Excited State Configuration**:
   - The second excited state is obtained by promoting another particle from \( n=2 \) to \( n=3 \).
   - The configuration becomes: two particles in \( n=1 \), and two particles in \( n=3 \).
   - Total energy: \( 2E + 18E = 20E \).

### Matching with Options:
- The calculated energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are \( 10E \), \( 15E \), and \( 20E \), respectively.
- However, none of the options directly match these values. Option D (\( 10E, 15E, 18E \)) is the closest, but it does not align with the calculated \( 20E \) for the second excited state.
- Despite this discrepancy, option D is the only one that starts with \( 10E \) for the ground state and \( 15E \) for the first excited state, which aligns with the calculations.

### Conclusion:
Based on the provided options and the analysis, the most reasonable choice is **Option D**.

Answer: D

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but let's try to think it through. The question is about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. I remember that in such a well, the energy levels are quantized, and each particle's energy depends on its quantum number.

Wait, the particles are spin-1/2, which means they're fermions, right? So they obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That's key because it affects how they fill up the energy levels. Since they're fermions, each quantum state can hold only one particle. But each state is characterized by the quantum number n and the spin. Hmm, but wait, in a one-dimensional box, the spin doesn't come into play for the spatial part of the wavefunction, right? So each spatial state can have two particles with opposite spins.

The well's length is L, so the energy levels are given by E_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²). And the problem says E is defined as pi²ħ²/(2mL²), so E_n = n² * E. That’s a helpful substitution.

Now, there are four particles. Let me list the energy levels from lowest to highest. The ground state is the lowest energy configuration. But because of the Pauli exclusion, the particles will fill up the lowest available orbitals, each with two particles (since each can have two spins).

Wait, in a 1D box, each n corresponds to a single orbital. Each orbital can hold two particles (spin-up and spin-down). So the first four particles would fill the lowest two orbitals, each with two particles.

So for four particles:

- The first two go into n=1 (each with opposite spins). So two particles here, contributing 1²E each. But since there are two particles, the total energy contribution is 2 * (1² E) = 2E? Or wait, no. Each particle in n=1 contributes E. So two particles would add 2E.

Wait, no, each particle in n=1 has energy E. So two particles in n=1 would be 2E.

Then the next two particles go into n=2. Each has energy (2² E) =4E. So two particles here would be 2 *4E=8E.

So the total energy for four particles in ground state would be 2E + 8E =10E. Hmm, wait, but wait—am I considering all possible states correctly?

Wait, maybe not. Because each n can hold two particles (spin up and down). So the order would be: fill n=1 with two particles (each E), then n=2 with two particles (each 4E), then n=3 with two, etc. But since we have four particles, n=1 holds two, n=2 holds two. So the total energy is 2E + 8E =10E for the ground state.

Wait, but wait again. The first energy level is n=1, with energy E. The second is n=2 at 4E. The third is n=3 at 9E, and so on. Each can hold two particles.

So four particles: first two in n=1 (2E), next two in n=2 (8E). So ground state has energy 2E +8E=10E? But wait, that's the total energy. So the ground state energy of the system is 10E. Hmm, but wait, the options don't have 10E as the ground state. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 30E,39E,50E

Option B:4E,10E,50E

Option C:4E,10E,15E

Option D:10E,15E,18E

Wait, the question is about the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. Oh wait, no, the question says calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in how the particles fill the states.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible states as each energy level being a separate state. So for four particles, how are the quantum numbers arranged.

Wait, the ground state is the lowest possible energy, which is all particles in the lowest possible orbitals, each with two particles.

So four particles would be two in n=1 and two in n=2. So the total energy is 2*(1² E) + 2*(2² E) = 2E + 8E =10E. So the ground state energy is 10E.

Wait, but wait again. Because each particle in the same orbital (same n) must have opposite spins. So for four spin-1/2 particles, the maximum number in the same n is two. So yes, 2 in n=1, 2 in n=2.

So ground state energy is 10E.

Now, the first excited state. What's the first excited state? It's the next possible configuration where the energy is just higher than the ground state.

So to get the first excited state, perhaps one of the particles in n=2 moves up to n=3. Because in the ground state, the configuration is (n=1)^2 (n=2)^2. To find the lowest possible first excited state, we promote the highest occupied particle to the next available orbital.

So, moving one of the n=2 particles to n=3. Now the configuration would be (n=1)^2 (n=2)^1 (n=3)^1. But wait, no, because each orbital can hold two particles.

Wait, no, in the ground state, we have two particles in n=1 and two in n=2. To get the first excited state, perhaps one particle from n=2 is promoted to n=3. So now, the configuration is two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3.

The energies would be: 2*E (n=1) + 1*(4E) (n=2) +1*(9E) (n=3). So total energy is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Wait, but that's 15E. But wait, is that the first excited state? Because maybe moving a particle from n=2 to n=3 is the first possible excitation.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when the two particles in n=2 are promoted to higher states in a way that the total energy is minimal.

Wait, but in the ground state, the four particles are in n=1 and n=2. The first possible excited state would be moving the last one from n=2 to n=3, giving a configuration of (2,1,1). So the energy is 2E +4E +9E =15E.

But wait, that's higher than the ground state. So the ground state is 10E, first excited is 15E.

Wait, but in the options, option D says the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, and second excited 18E.

But the question is about the system's energy. So ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, next would be when another particle is promoted.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, but the other stays. So the energy becomes 2E + (4E +9E) + 4E for the others. Wait, no, because we have four particles in total.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the possible states.

Wait, another approach: The total energy E_total is the sum of the energies of each particle. Each particle’s energy is n² E.

Because the particles are fermions, their wavefunctions must be anti-symmetric. But in a 1D box, the spatial part is symmetric or antisymmetric based on n. Wait, but I'm a bit confused about that. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the quantum numbers and spin as part of the overall state.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the possible filled states for four particles.

In the ground state, the lowest two n's are filled with maximum two particles each: n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles). So E=10E.

The first excited state: the lowest possible energy higher than ground state. So perhaps one of the particles in n=2 moves to n=3. So the configuration is 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, and 1 in n=3. So the energy is 2E +4E +9E =15E.

Wait, but wait a minute: each particle in n=3 contributes 9E, but there's only one particle there. So the total is 2*1E (n=1) +1*4E (n=2) +1*9E (n=3) = 2 +4 +9=15 E.

So the first excited state is 15E, and the ground state is 10E.

What about the second excited state? Next would be the next possible configuration. Perhaps another particle moves up. So now, you have two in n=1, two in n=3. Because in the first excited state, it was 2,1,1. Now, the next would perhaps promote the remaining n=2 particle to n=3, making two in n=3 and two in n=1.

Wait, but can we have two particles in n=3? Because each n can hold two, yes. So in that case, the configuration would be n=1^2 and n=3^2. The energy here would be 2*1E + 2*9E = 2E +18E=20E.

But wait, is 20E higher than the first excited state?

Wait, but perhaps that's the second excited state. Alternatively, maybe the second excited state is when two particles are promoted, but perhaps another configuration is lower. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the second excited state is when one of the n=2 particles goes to n=4. Wait, but n=4's energy is 16E; that would be even higher.

Wait, let me think again. The possible states are ordered by their energies. So after the ground state (10E), the next possible is 15E (2,1,1). Then, is the next configuration when n=2^2 and n=3^0? No, that's the ground state. No.

Wait, another way: Maybe the first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, giving 2,1,1. The next would be moving another n=2 to n=3, giving 2,0,2. So the energy would be 2*1E + 2*9E = 2 +18=20E.

But that's higher than 15E. So the order would be 10E (ground), 15E (first excited), 20E (second excited). But looking at the options, option D says the second excited state is 18E. Hmm, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the first excited state isn't just moving one particle. Let me think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is achieved by moving a particle from n=2 to n=3, but keeping another particle in n=2. So the total energy is 2*1E + 1*4E +1*9E= 15E.

Then, the second excited state could be moving another particle from n=2 to n=4. So particles in n=1^2, n=2^1, n=4^1. Energy would be 2*1E +1*4E +1*16E= 2+4+16=22E. But 22 isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3, giving energy 2*9E=18E, plus the two in n=1, which is 2E. So total 2E +18E=20E. But again, 20 isn't an option.

Looking at the options, the only option with 10E as the ground state is options B and D.

Option B says ground 4E, first 10E, second 50E.

Option D says ground 10E, first 15E, second 18E.

Wait, but our calculation for the ground state was 10E, first excited 15E, and second excited perhaps 20E, but that's not an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the ground state calculation. Let me go back.

The four particles are spin-1/2. In a one-dimensional box, each spatial state can hold two particles (because of spin). So the filling is as follows:

n=1: 2 particles.

n=2: 2 particles.

So the total energy is 2*(1^2 E) + 2*(2^2 E) =2E +8E=10E. So ground state is 10E.

So the options that have 10E as ground state are options B (ground 4E, no), and option D (ground 10E). So options B and D have 10E in their ground state or elsewhere.

Wait, option D says ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E.

So that would fit if the second excited state is when the configuration is n=3^2 and n=1^2, because that would be 2*9E =18E plus 2*1E, total 20E. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is something else.

Wait, perhaps when considering the possible excited states, the lowest possible would be moving one particle from n=2 to n=3, giving 2,1,1 (15E). Then, the next possible is moving another to n=3, giving 2,0,2 (20E). But 20E is not an option in D.

Wait, but option D says second excited state is 18E. 18E is 2*(3^2 E) → 2*9E=18E. So if the configuration is two particles in n=3 and two in n=1, that would require 2*(9E) +2*(1E) =20E, which is higher than 15E.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a configuration. Maybe the second excited state is when three particles are promoted, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the first and second excited states.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when a particle is excited from n=1 to n=2, but that can't be, because n=1 is already filled with two particles; you can't have more than two in n=1. So the next available is n=2. Wait, no, n=2 is already filled with two particles.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the possible states are determined by the possible partitions of four particles into the available n's, with each n holding at most two particles.

The possible partitions are:

1. (4): but each n can hold two, so this would require n=2, but 4 particles can't be in one n. So that's not allowed.

Wait, no, perhaps the possible partitions of four particles into n's considering each n can have up to two.

The possible partitions are:

- (2,2): n=1 and n=2 each have two particles. This is the ground state, energy 2E +8E=10E.

- (2,1,1): move one from n=2 to n=3. So two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. Energy: 2E +4E +9E=15E.

- (2,0,2): move both from n=2 to n=3. Energy:2E + 2*9E=20E.

- (1,1,1,1): each n=1 to 4 has one particle. But that's impossible because each n can hold two. So four particles would be each in a separate n, but that's only possible if four n's are filled with one each. But wait, no, because for four particles, each with their own n, you can have n=1,2,3,4 each with one particle. But that would require four n's. But can we have four particles each in different n's? Because each n can hold two particles, but for four particles, each n can have one, so n=1,2,3,4 each have one.

But wait, that's four particles, each in a unique n. But each n can take two, so that's allowed.

Wait, but in that case, the energy would be 1²E +2²E +3²E +4²E= 1E +4E +9E +16E=30E.

Wait, that's the configuration where each particle is in a separate n. So that's option A's first energy, which is 30E. But that's higher than the 20E from the (2,0,2) configuration.

But how does this fit into the excited states? Let me think about the available options.

The possible configurations for four particles are:

1. (2,2): 2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2. Energy 10E.

2. (2,1,1): 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3. Energy 15E.

3. (2,0,2): 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3. Energy 20E.

4. (1,1,1,1): 1 in each n=1,2,3,4. Energy 30E.

Are there any other configurations? For example, (0,2,2), which would be 2 in n=2 and 2 in n=3. That's 8E +18E=26E. Wait, that's higher than 20E but lower than 30E.

So among these, the energies are 10E (ground), 15E (first excited), 20E (second excited), 26E, 30E.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D says the second excited state is 18E. Hmm, which isn’t matching 20E. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, giving two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. So 2+4+9=15E.

Then, the second excited state is when another particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, resulting in two in n=1 and two in n=3. The energy here is 2*1E + 2*9E= 2E +18E=20E. So 20E is the second excited state.

But none of the options have 20E for the second excited state. Wait, looking again at the options:

Option A: 30, 39,50.

Option B:4,10,50.

Option C:4,10,15.

Option D:10,15,18.

So, in our calculation, the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 20E. But none of the options match this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in how the particles are filled. Maybe the first excited state is when a particle moves from n=1 to n=2, but that can't be because n=1 is already filled with two.

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Maybe the way the particles are filled is different because they're fermions and each state must be unique.

Wait, perhaps the particles fill their states based on the quantum numbers and spin. Let me think about the Pauli exclusion in terms of their quantum states.

In a 1D box, each state is uniquely determined by n and spin. So each n can have two states: spin up and spin down.

So for four particles, the filling would be:

n=1: spin up and down → two particles.

n=2: spin up and down → two particles.

That’s the ground state, energy 10E.

The first excited state would be the next possible state where one of the particles in n=2 moves to n=3. So n=3 would have one spin up (and empty spin down?), but no, each n can have two spins. So moving a particle to n=3 would require it to take one of the two spin states.

So the configuration is:

n=1: two particles (both spins).

n=2: one particle (one spin), n=3: one particle (one spin).

Wait, but each n can hold two, so n=2 now has one, and n=3 has one.

But for four particles, that's two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. So the total energy is 2*(1E) + 1*(4E) +1*(9E) =2 +4 +9=15E.

So that's the first excited state. Now, the second excited state would be when another particle moves from n=2 to n=3. So now, n=2 has zero, n=3 has two, and n=1 has two. So the energy is 2*(1E) +0 +2*(9E)=2 +0 +18=20E. So the second excited state would be 20E.

But none of the options have 20E. So perhaps I'm missing something about the possible states.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the second excited state isn't moving a second particle from n=2 to n=3, but instead moving a particle from n=3 to a higher n, but that would increase the energy further.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when a particle from n=1 is promoted, but that's not possible because n=1 is already filled.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me look at the options again.

Option D says the second excited state is 18E. 18E is 2*9E. So maybe that's when two particles are in n=3, and two in n=1. But that configuration would have energy 20E, not 18E. Hmm.

Wait, unless I'm miscalculating the configuration. No, 2*(9E)=18E, but plus two in n=1, which is 2E, so total 20E.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when a single particle is promoted from n=3 to n=4, but that would take energy from 9E to 16E, so adding 7E. So the new state would be 2 particles in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4. Energy: 2E +4E +16E=22E.

But 22E isn't an option either.

Hmm. Maybe I should consider that perhaps each particle can have a different n, but not necessarily filled up. So for four particles, the possible lowest energies would be:

Ground state: (n=1)^2, (n=2)^2 →10E.

First excited: (n=1)^2, (n=2)^1, (n=3)^1 →15E.

Second excited: (n=1)^2, (n=3)^2 →20E.

So three states are 10,15,20.

Looking at the options, none of them have 20E as the third state. So perhaps the question is considering the system's energy in a different way.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the possibility of having more than two particles in higher n's. Wait, no, that's not possible because each n can have two.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in considering the system's energy as the sum of each particle's energy. Let me verify that.

Each particle's energy is (n_i)^2 E, so the total is the sum of all n_i squared times E.

In the ground state:

Two particles in n=1 →2*(1)^2 E =2E.

Two in n=2 →2*(4) E=8E.

Total:10E.

First excited: two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3.

Sum: 2*1 +4 +9=15 →15E.

Second excited: two in n=1, two in n=3 → sum 2 + 2*9=20 →20E.

But none of the options have 20E as the third state.

Wait, looking at the options, option D says 18E as the second excited state. 18E is 2*9=18. But that would require two particles in n=3 and two in n=1, sum 20E.

Wait, unless the system's states are considered in terms of the sum of the squares of the quantum numbers. So, perhaps when particles are promoted beyond n=3, let's see.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the first excited state is when a particle is promoted from n=2 to n=4, but that would require a higher energy than promoting to n=3. So that's less likely.

Wait, let me see option D: ground 10, first excited 15, second 18. How could that happen?

If the second excited state is when particles are in n=1^2, n=2^1, and n=4^1. So sum would be 2*(1) +4 +16=22E. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and one in n=2, but that would require five particles, which isn't the case here.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible answers.

Wait, option B says the ground state is 4E, first excited 10E, second 50E. That seems unlikely because 4E would be two particles in n=2 (each 4E, but 2*4E=8E), but 4E is much lower.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the filling. Let me think again.

Wait, four spin-1/2 particles, so each can have two states. In a 1D box, the quantum number is n, and each n can hold two spins.

Wait, perhaps the way of filling is n=1, n=2, etc. But for four particles, the ground state would have two in n=1 and two in n=2, as I thought earlier.

So that gives 2E +8E=10E.

The first excited state would involve moving one of the n=2 particles to n=3, leading to 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Second excited state would have another particle moving from n=2 to n=3, giving 2E + 18E=20E.

So the energies would be 10E,15E,20E.

Looking at the options, none of them match this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the energies of the individual particles, but that doesn't make sense because the options give sums like 30E, which would be 1+4+9+16=30E, but that's four particles each in n=1,2,3,4.

Wait, but the question says, "energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system."

So the system's energy is the sum of all particles' energies.

If the ground state is (2,2) →10E.

First excited is (2,1,1):15E.

Second excited is (2,0,2):20E.

But none of the options have 20E. Wait, but option D says the second excited is 18E, which would be 2*9=18. So perhaps the second excited state is when two are in n=3 and two in n=1, giving 20E, but that's not in the options.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the first excited state isn't moving just one particle but involves a different configuration.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3 and another to n=4. So the configuration is (2,1,1,1). But that's four particles in n=1,2,3,4. So the sum is 1+4+9+16=30E. Which is option A's first energy.

But that would make the first excited state 30E, which is higher than 15E. So that can't be the first excited state.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and the others stay as in the ground state.

Wait, but that would require the configuration (2,2, 1?), but that's not allowed because each n can hold two.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4, but that's higher.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me look at the options again.

Option D: 10E,15E,18E.

So, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 (each 9E), and the other two in n=1 (each 1E). So total is 2*1 + 2*9= 2 +18=20E. But option D has 18E for the second excited state. So that's not matching.

Wait, unless I've made a mistake in calculating the sum.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the first excited state is when one of the n=1 particles moves to n=2, but that's already filled. So that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when a particle moves from n=2 to n=3, but I think that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when both particles in n=2 move to n=3, leading to (2,0,2). So the energy is 2*1 + 2*9=20E. But again, that's not in the options.

Hmm. Maybe the question is not about the sum of all particles but about some other aspect. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in how the particles are filled.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of possible state configurations and their energies.

The possible configurations and their energies:

1. (2,2): sum=2+8=10E → ground state.

2. (2,1,1): sum=2+4+9=15E → first excited.

3. (1,1,1,1): sum=1+4+9+16=30E → higher.

4. (2,0,2): sum=2+0+18=20E → second excited.

5. (1,1,2): sum=1+1+8=10E → same as ground state.

Wait, no, that's not possible because (1,1,2) would imply three n's, but with only three particles. Hmm, perhaps not.

Another possible configuration might be (2,0,1,1), but that would sum to 2+0+4+9=15E, which is the same as (2,1,1). So perhaps that's not a distinct state.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is (1,2,1), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4. But that would sum to 1+4+9+16=30E. But that's higher than 15E.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck, so perhaps I should check the options again.

The only option that starts with 10E is option D. It says the energies are 10E,15E,18E.

So perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4, but that would be 1+4+9+16=30E. But option D's second excited is 18E, which doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in considering the possible configurations. Maybe the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3, but that would require the configuration (2,0,2), which sums to 20E.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the energies of the individual particles rather than the sum, but that doesn't make sense for the system's energy.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the sum of the squares of the quantum numbers, but that doesn't change anything.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the possible energy levels for the system, regardless of the particle configuration, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, perhaps the ground state is not (2,2) but something else. No, that can't be right because two particles in each n=1 and n=2 is the lowest possible.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the particles are bosons, but the question says they're spin-1/2, which are fermions.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the options again and see which one fits the possible calculations.

If option D says the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second 18E.

How can 18E be achieved? 18E would be 2*9E, so two particles in n=3. But that requires two particles in n=3 and two in n=1. So sum 2*1 + 2*9=20E. So 18E can't be achieved.

Wait, unless in the second excited state, one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4, but that would be 9E +16E=25E, plus the two in n=1. So 2+9+16=27E, which is not an option.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when a particle is promoted from n=1 to n=3, but that's not possible because n=1 is filled.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when a particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, and another from n=2 to n=4. That would give two in n=1, one in n=3, one in n=4. The sum would be 2*1 +9 +16= 2+9+16=27E.

But again, not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and three in other states, but that seems unlikely.

Hmm. Another Approach:

Each particle must have a unique quantum state, so the possible states are filled as per the Pauli exclusion.

The lowest possible energies are when particles are in the lowest possible n's.

So for four particles:

n=1: 2 particles.

n=2: 2 particles.

So ground state energy: 2*(1² E) + 2*(2² E) =2E +8E=10E.

First excited state: promote one of the n=2 particles to n=3.

So now, n=3 has 1 particle.

So the sum is 2*(1) + (4) + (9) =2+4+9=15E.

Second excited state: promote another n=2 particle to n=3.

Now, n=3 has 2 particles.

Sum:2*1 +0*4 +2*9=2+0+18=20E.

So the energies are 10E,15E,20E.

Looking at the options, none have 20E as the third state. So perhaps the correct option isn't listed, but that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in the configuration.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the system's energy levels are ordered based on the sum of the quantum numbers, but that's not correct because higher n's have higher energies.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state isn't (2,0,2) but a different configuration.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=4. So the configuration is two in n=1, two in n=2, and zero elsewhere. No, that's the ground state.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the second excited state is when a particle is promoted from n=2 to n=4. So n=1 has two, n=2 has one, n=4 has one.

Sum:2*1 +4 +16=2+4+16=22E.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Maybe I should try to eliminate the options.

Option B: ground state 4E. How would that happen? 4E would be two particles in n=2, each 4E. But that would require four particles in n=2, which isn't possible because each n can have two. So two in n=2 would give 8E, not 4E. So option B seems incorrect.

Option C: ground 4E, first 10E, second 15E. The ground state 4E would be two particles in n=2, which would sum to 8E. So that's impossible. So option C is wrong.

Option A: ground state 30E, which would be each particle in a separate n=1,2,3,4. That's 1+4+9+16=30E. But that's a higher energy than the ground state because in the ground state, you can have more particles in lower n's.

So option A can't be correct because the ground state is 10E, as calculated.

That leaves option D as the only possible one, even though our calculation for the second excited state is 20E, which isn't in option D.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state isn't (2,0,2) but (1,1,1,1), which is 30E. But that's the highest energy.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in how the excited states are ordered.

Wait, the order of energies would be:

Ground state:10E →(2,2).

First excited state:15E →(2,1,1).

Second excited state:20E →(2,0,2).

So the energies are 10,15,20.

But none of the options match. Therefore, perhaps the correct option isn't present, but this can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. It says, "energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system." So, perhaps the system's energy is the sum, which is what I've been calculating.

Wait, but perhaps the question is asking for the energies in terms of E, but E is given as E=pi^2 hbar^2/(2mL^2). So each n^2 *E is the energy for that particle.

Wait, perhaps the system's energy is the sum. So for four particles, the ground state sum is 10E, first excited sum is 15E, second excited sum is 20E. But none of the options have that.

Wait, the only option that starts with 10E is option D:10,15,18.

But 18E is 2*(3^2 E) =18E. So perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=1.

Wait, that would make the sum 2*1 +2*9=20E. So perhaps option D is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3 and another to n=4. So the sum would be 2*1 +4 +9 +16=31E. But that's even higher.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Based on the options provided, the only one that makes sense is option D:10,15,18, but I don't see how that fits.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the second excited state. Maybe the second excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=3 to n=4, but that would require a higher energy.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4. So the sum would be 2*1 (n=1) +1*4 (n=2) +1*16 (n=4) = 2+4+16=22E. Still not matching.

Another possibility: the ground state is 10E, first excited is 15E, and the second excited is when two particles are in n=3, but that's 20E.

Wait, perhaps the question is wrong, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a more optimal configuration. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state isn't (2,0,2) but (1,1,2). But how many particles would that involve? n=1 has two (2E), n=2 has two (8E), which is the ground state. So that's not helpful.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Given the options, the only one that starts with 10E is option D. So perhaps the correct answer is option D:10,15,18.

But I'm not entirely sure how 18E is achieved. Maybe I should go with that.


The problem involves four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length \( L \). The energy levels of the system are quantized and given by \( E_n = n^2 E \), where \( E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2} \). Since the particles are fermions, they obey the Pauli exclusion principle, and each quantum state can hold at most two particles (one for each spin state). The goal is to determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Ground State Configuration**:
   - The lowest energy configuration occurs when the particles fill the lowest available orbitals.
   - Two particles occupy \( n=1 \) (each contributing \( E \)), and two particles occupy \( n=2 \) (each contributing \( 4E \)).
   - Total energy: \( 2E + 8E = 10E \).

2. **First Excited State Configuration**:
   - The first excited state is obtained by promoting one particle from \( n=2 \) to \( n=3 \).
   - The configuration becomes: two particles in \( n=1 \), one particle in \( n=2 \), and one particle in \( n=3 \).
   - Total energy: \( 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E \).

3. **Second Excited State Configuration**:
   - The second excited state is obtained by promoting another particle from \( n=2 \) to \( n=3 \).
   - The configuration becomes: two particles in \( n=1 \), and two particles in \( n=3 \).
   - Total energy: \( 2E + 18E = 20E \).

### Matching with Options:
- The calculated energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are \( 10E \), \( 15E \), and \( 20E \), respectively.
- However, none of the options directly match these values. Option D (\( 10E, 15E, 18E \)) is the closest, but it does not align with the calculated \( 20E \) for the second excited state.
- Despite this discrepancy, option D is the only one that starts with \( 10E \) for the ground state and \( 15E \) for the first excited state, which aligns with the calculations.

### Conclusion:
Based on the provided options and the analysis, the most reasonable choice is **Option D**.

Answer: D
