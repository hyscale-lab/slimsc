Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through. The question is about the energy difference between two quantum states and whether we can clearly distinguish them based on their lifetimes. Hmm.

Alright, the problem states: Two quantum states have energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly resolve them. The options are A to D with different eV values.

Wait, quantum states with different lifetimes... I remember something about lifetimes and the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! Which relates the uncertainty in energy and the lifetime (or the time for which the energy is measured).

The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle formula is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So if the lifetime (Δt) is the time over which the energy is measured, then the uncertainty in energy ΔE is inversely proportional to Δt. 

Wait, but what exactly is Δt here? Oh right, the lifetime of the state is the time for which the system is in that state before decaying. So for each state, the uncertainty in energy would be ħ/(2Δt). But wait, in this problem, each state has a different lifetime. So E1 has a lifetime τ1 =1e-9 s, E2 has τ2=1e-8 s.

Wait, but the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. So I think we're looking at the energy resolution. To clearly distinguish two energy levels, the energy difference ΔE between them should be larger than the sum of their uncertainties, maybe? Or perhaps each state's uncertainty? Hmm, not entirely sure. Let me think.

Wait, in energy measurements, the precision (or the uncertainty ΔE) needed to resolve two levels would be such that the energy difference between them is greater than the uncertainty. So, if ΔE (energy difference) is much larger than the uncertainty in each measurement, then the two levels can be distinguished.

So in other words, to resolve E1 and E2, the energy difference ΔE = |E2 - E1| should be greater than the sum of the uncertainties for each state. Or perhaps the worst case uncertainty, like the larger of the two. Wait, maybe it's the minimum uncertainty that matters. I'm a bit confused here.

Let me approach this step by step. First, calculate the uncertainty in energy for each state.

For state 1: τ1 =1e-9 s. So ΔE1 = ħ/(2 τ1)
Similarly, for state 2: ΔE2 = ħ/(2 τ2)

But wait, ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. Oh, but the problem uses eV as the unit for energy. So maybe I should convert ħ into eV·s.

I remember that 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So ħ in eV·s is: 1.0545718e-34 J·s * (1 eV / 1.602e-19 J) ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So ħ ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s. So now I can compute ΔE for each state.

Calculate ΔE1: 6.582e-16 eV·s / (2 * 1e-9 s) = 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = 3.291e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2: 6.582e-16 / (2 *1e-8) ) = 6.582e-16 / 2e-8 = 3.291e-8 eV.

So the uncertainty in energy for state 1 is about 3.29e-7 eV, and for state 2, it's 3.29e-8 eV.

Wait, but when you want to distinguish two states, the energy difference between them should be larger than the sum of their uncertainties. Because otherwise, the uncertainties could overlap, making it hard to tell if the observed energy is E1 or E2.

So ΔE (E2 - E1) should be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Wait, but let me think. Suppose E2 is higher than E1. The uncertainty in E1 is ΔE1, and in E2 is ΔE2. So the energy difference between them should be at least the sum of the two uncertainties to make sure that E2 - E1 > ΔE1 + ΔE2. Otherwise, the two could overlap, and you can't tell the difference.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference only needs to be larger than the larger uncertainty, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for the minimum required.

So let's compute ΔE1 + ΔE2: 3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 = 3.619e-7 eV.

So the energy difference should be greater than approximately 3.6e-7 eV.

Now, let's look at the options:

Options:
A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 → much smaller than 3.6e-7
B) 1e-11 eV → 0.00001e-6 → way too small
C) 1e-4 eV → 0.1e-3 → which is 1e-4, which is 1e-4 eV. Let's see, 1e-4 is 1e-4, which is 0.0001 eV. That's 1e-4 eV is 1e-4, which is 1e-4 eV is bigger than 3.6e-7 eV. Oh yeah, 1e-4 is much larger than 3.6e-7. Because 3.6e-7 is 0.00036e-3, while 1e-4 is 0.0001. Wait, no, wait, 1e-4 is 0.0001, and 3.6e-7 is 0.00000036, so 1e-4 is larger.

Wait, 1e-4 is 0.0001, and 3.6e-7 is 0.00000036. So 0.0001 is much bigger than 0.00000036. So 1e-4 eV would be a sufficient ΔE.

Option D: 1e-8 eV → 0.00001e-3 → 0.00001e-3. That's 1e-8, which is 0.00000001. Less than 3.6e-7. So D is too small.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute 3.6e-7 eV. That's 0.36e-6 eV. So, 0.36 microvolts. So any energy difference larger than that would be resolvable.

Looking at the options:

C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 eV. 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV, which is 100 microvolts. That's way larger than 0.36 microvolts (3.6e-7 eV).

So the correct option would be C. Because it's the only one that's bigger than the required 3.6e-7 eV.

Wait, but wait a second. Another way: The energy uncertainty for each state is ΔE1 = ~3.29e-7 eV, ΔE2 = ~3.29e-8 eV. So the larger uncertainty is ΔE1. So if the energy difference between E2 and E1 is much larger than the larger of the two uncertainties, which is ΔE1, then it's resolvable. So ΔE needs to be bigger than ΔE1, perhaps?

Wait, because E2 has a longer lifetime (1e-8 s) than E1 (1e-9 s). So E2 has a smaller energy uncertainty. So the dominant uncertainty is from E1. So perhaps the energy difference just needs to be larger than ΔE1, which is 3.29e-7 eV.

But let's see the options. So option C is 1e-4 eV, which is way larger than 3.29e-7. So it's sufficient. But what about option D, 1e-8 eV? That's smaller than 3.29e-7. So that's insufficient.

Wait, but the question is about the energy difference between the two states. So perhaps the minimum required is that the energy difference is greater than the sum of the individual uncertainties. Or is it the maximum of the two? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference should be greater than the smaller uncertainty. Because if E2 has a smaller uncertainty, and E1 a larger one, then the difference needs to be at least the larger uncertainty. Because if the difference is bigger than the larger uncertainty, the states won't overlap.

Wait, think about it. Suppose E1 is at 5 eV, and E2 is at 5.36e-7 eV. Then the difference is 0.36e-6 eV. But that's way smaller than the uncertainties. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the actual energy levels with their uncertainties.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the minimum energy difference required to be resolved, which is approximately the sum of the uncertainties. Let me recheck.

The uncertainty in E1 is 3.29e-7 eV, and in E2 is 3.29e-8 eV. So the maximum uncertainty between the two would be when one is at E1 + ΔE1 and the other is at E2 - ΔE2. The minimal difference between the upper bound of E1 and lower bound of E2 must be positive for them to be distinguishable.

So E2_min = E2 - ΔE2 = E2 - 3.29e-8 eV.

E1_max = E1 + ΔE1 = E1 + 3.29e-7 eV.

To have E2_min > E1_max, then (E2 - ΔE2) > (E1 + ΔE1). So E2 - E1 > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So the energy difference needs to be greater than the sum of the uncertainties.

Compute that sum: 3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 = 3.619e-7 eV.

So the energy difference should be greater than about 3.6e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, only option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 eV. Let's compute 3.6e-7 eV: that's 0.00000036 eV. So 1e-4 is 0.0001, which is much larger. So yes, option C is larger than the required 3.6e-7 eV.

So the correct answer should be C.

To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \approx \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state and \( \Delta E \) is the uncertainty in energy. The reduced Planck's constant \( \hbar \) is approximately \( 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \).

### Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainties for each state
For the first state with lifetime \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \tau_1} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} = 3.291 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

For the second state with lifetime \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \tau_2} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} = 3.291 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Determine the minimum energy difference for distinguishability
To clearly resolve two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties:
\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2.
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\Delta E > 3.291 \times 10^{-7} + 3.291 \times 10^{-8} = 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 3: Evaluate the options
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \), which is much smaller than \( 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 1 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \), which is also much smaller than \( 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 1 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \), which is \( 0.0001 \, \text{eV} \). This is much larger than \( 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Sufficient.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 1 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

### Conclusion
The only energy difference that satisfies the condition \( \Delta E > 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \) is \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \).

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through. The question is about the energy difference between two quantum states and whether we can clearly distinguish them based on their lifetimes. Hmm.

So for each state, the uncertainty in energy would be ħ/(2Δt). But wait, in this problem, each state has a different lifetime. So E1 has a lifetime τ1 =1e-9 s, E2 has τ2=1e-8 s.

Let me approach this step by step. First, calculate the uncertainty in energy for each state.

For state 1: τ1 =1e-9 s. So ΔE1 = ħ/(2 τ1)
Similarly, for state 2: ΔE2 = ħ/(2 τ2)

But wait, ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. Oh, but the problem uses eV as the unit for energy. So maybe I should convert ħ into eV·s.

I remember that 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So ħ in eV·s is: 1.0545718e-34 J·s * (1 eV / 1.602e-19 J) ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So ħ ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s. So now I can compute ΔE for each state.

Calculate ΔE1: 6.582e-16 eV·s / (2 * 1e-9 s) = 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = 3.291e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2: 6.582e-16 / (2 *1e-8) ) = 6.582e-16 / 2e-8 = 3.291e-8 eV.

So the uncertainty in energy for state 1 is about 3.29e-7 eV, and for state 2, it's 3.29e-8 eV.

Wait, but when you want to distinguish two states, the energy difference between them should be larger than the sum of their uncertainties. Because otherwise, the uncertainties could overlap, making it hard to tell if the observed energy is E1 or E2.

So ΔE (E2 - E1) should be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Wait, but let me think. Suppose E2 is higher than E1. The uncertainty in E1 is ΔE1, and in E2 is ΔE2. So the energy difference between them should be at least the sum of the two uncertainties to make sure that E2 - E1 > ΔE1 + ΔE2. Otherwise, the two could overlap, and you can't tell the difference.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference only needs to be larger than the larger uncertainty, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for the minimum required.

So let's compute ΔE1 + ΔE2: 3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 = 3.619e-7 eV.

So the energy difference should be greater than approximately 3.6e-7 eV.

Now, let's look at the options:

Options:
A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 → much smaller than 3.6e-7
B) 1e-11 eV → 0.00001e-6 → way too small
C) 1e-4 eV → 0.1e-3 → which is 1e-4, which is 1e-4 eV. Let's see, 1e-4 is 1e-4, which is 0.0001 eV. That's 1e-4 eV is 1e-4, which is 1e-4 eV is bigger than 3.6e-7 eV. Oh yeah, 1e-4 is much larger than 3.6e-7. Because 3.6e-7 is 0.00036e-3, while 1e-4 is 0.0001. Wait, no, wait, 1e-4 is 0.0001, and 3.6e-7 is 0.00000036, so 1e-4 is larger.

Wait, 1e-4 is 0.0001, and 3.6e-7 is 0.00000036. So 0.0001 is much bigger than 0.00000036. So 1e-4 eV would be a sufficient ΔE.

Option D: 1e-8 eV → 0.00001e-3 → 0.00001e-3. That's 1e-8, which is 0.00000001. Less than 3.6e-7. So D is too small.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute 3.6e-7 eV. That's 0.36e-6 eV. So, 0.36 microvolts. So any energy difference larger than that would be resolvable.

Looking at the options:

C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 eV. 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV, which is 100 microvolts. That's way larger than 0.36 microvolts (3.6e-7 eV).

So the correct option would be C. Because it's the only one that's bigger than the required 3.6e-7 eV.

Wait, but wait a second. Another way: The energy uncertainty for each state is ΔE1 = ~3.29e-7 eV, ΔE2 = ~3.29e-8 eV. So the larger uncertainty is ΔE1. So if the energy difference between E2 and E1 is much larger than the larger of the two uncertainties, which is ΔE1, then it's resolvable. So ΔE needs to be bigger than ΔE1, perhaps?

Wait, because E2 has a longer lifetime (1e-8 s) than E1 (1e-9 s). So E2 has a smaller energy uncertainty. So the dominant uncertainty is from E1. So perhaps the energy difference just needs to be larger than ΔE1, which is 3.29e-7 eV.

But let's see the options. So option C is 1e-4 eV, which is way larger than 3.29e-7. So it's sufficient. But what about option D, 1e-8 eV? That's smaller than 3.29e-7. So that's insufficient.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference should be greater than the smaller uncertainty. Because if E2 has a smaller uncertainty, and E1 a larger one, then the difference needs to be at least the larger uncertainty. Because if the difference is bigger than the larger uncertainty, the states won't overlap.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the minimum energy difference required to be resolved, which is approximately the sum of the uncertainties. Let me recheck.

The uncertainty in E1 is 3.29e-7 eV, and in E2 is 3.29e-8 eV. So the maximum uncertainty between the two would be when one is at E1 + ΔE1 and the other is at E2 - ΔE2. The minimal difference between the upper bound of E1 and lower bound of E2 must be positive for them to be distinguishable.

So E2_min = E2 - ΔE2 = E2 - 3.29e-8 eV.

E1_max = E1 + ΔE1 = E1 + 3.29e-7 eV.

To have E2_min > E1_max, then (E2 - ΔE2) > (E1 + ΔE1). So E2 - E1 > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So the energy difference needs to be greater than the sum of the uncertainties.

Compute that sum: 3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 = 3.619e-7 eV.

So the energy difference should be greater than about 3.6e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, only option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 eV. Let's compute 3.6e-7 eV: that's 0.00000036 eV. So 1e-4 is 0.0001, which is much larger. So yes, option C is larger than the required 3.6e-7 eV.

So the correct answer should be C.


To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \approx \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state and \( \Delta E \) is the uncertainty in energy. The reduced Planck's constant \( \hbar \) is approximately \( 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \).

### Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainties for each state
For the first state with lifetime \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \tau_1} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} = 3.291 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

For the second state with lifetime \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \tau_2} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} = 3.291 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Determine the minimum energy difference for distinguishability
To clearly resolve two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties:
\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2.
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\Delta E > 3.291 \times 10^{-7} + 3.291 \times 10^{-8} = 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 3: Evaluate the options
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \), which is much smaller than \( 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 1 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \), which is also much smaller than \( 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 1 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \), which is \( 0.0001 \, \text{eV} \). This is much larger than \( 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Sufficient.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 1 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

### Conclusion
The only energy difference that satisfies the condition \( \Delta E > 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \) is \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \).

**Answer: C**
