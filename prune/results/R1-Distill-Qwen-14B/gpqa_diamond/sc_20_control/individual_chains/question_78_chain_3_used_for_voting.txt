Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. The setup is that a charge q is moving along a trajectory s(t), and we're looking at the potentials at a field point r at time t. The vector d is from the point where the field was generated at time tr (which is earlier than t) to the observation point r. The velocity at the generating time tr is v.

So, the question is asking what are the expressions for the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at time t. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different forms for V and A.

Hmm, I remember that potentials in electromagnetism are usually derived from the fields. The scalar potential V is related to the electric field E, and the vector potential A is related to the magnetic field B. The fields are due to a moving charge, which means we might be dealing with retarded potentials because the charge is moving, and the fields depend on where the charge was some time ago.

Right, the retarded time concept comes into play when the source is moving. The potentials are evaluated at the retarded time tr, which is the time it would take for the influence of the charge to reach the observation point. So, tr = t - r/c, where r is the distance between the charge's position at tr and the observation point r. But wait, in this problem, they've already defined d as the vector from the field generating point (at tr) to r. So, d would be the displacement vector from the charge's position at tr to the point r. So, the magnitude of d is |d|, and if I think about r, it's probably |r - s(tr)|, but since d is defined as r - s(tr), then |d| is the distance between the charge and the field point at time tr.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. The charge is at position s(tr) at time tr. The observation point is r. So, the vector from the charge's position to r is d = r - s(tr). So, the distance is |d|, and the time it takes for the charge's influence to reach r is tr = t - |d|/c. So, the charge's position at tr is s(tr), and the observation point is at r at time t.

Now, the potentials. I think the general expressions for the potentials due to a moving charge are as follows. The scalar potential V is given by (1/(4πε₀)) times q over the distance, but considering the retarded time. So, V(r, t) = q/(4πε₀) * (1/|d|). Wait, no, because |d| is the distance from the charge at tr to r, which is correct. So V is similar to the static case but evaluated at tr. So V would be V(r, t) = q/(4πε₀ |d|) * (1/(1 - (v·d̂)/c²)) ), but wait, perhaps that's when considering the Lorentz contraction. Alternatively, I recall that potentials for a moving charge might have some factors involving the velocity.

Wait, no, perhaps for potentials, the scalar potential is just V = q/(4πε₀ r'), where r' is the distance at the retarded time. So r' is |d|, because d is the vector from the charge's position (at tr) to r. So V would be q/(4πε₀ |d|). 

What about the vector potential A? The vector potential is given by A = (μ₀ q v)/(4π) times some function. I think the vector potential for a moving charge is given by A = (μ₀ q v)/(4π c²) (1/(1 - (v·d̂)/c²) )) or something along those lines. Wait, but maybe I'm mixing this up.

Wait, another approach. The potentials are calculated using the retarded potentials formulas. The scalar potential V is (q/(4πε₀)) * (1/|r - s(tr)|) ) * [1/(1 - (v·r̂)/c²)]^(-1) ? Or perhaps it's without that term. Wait, no, I think the scalar potential is simpler. Because the scalar potential is due to the charge's electric field, but when the charge is moving, the expression might involve a factor due to the motion. Alternatively, perhaps the potentials are as follows:

V(r, t) = [ q/(4πε₀) ] * [ 1/( |d| ) ] 

And the vector potential A is [ (μ₀ q v)/(4π) ] [ 1/( |d| ) ] multiplied by some function. Wait, let's think about the expression for A. 

I remember that the vector potential A is given by (μ₀ q)/(4π c²) ∫ (v' × r') dt', but for a point charge, the integral simplifies. Alternatively, for a charge moving with velocity v at time tr, the vector potential at r and t would be (μ₀ q v )/(4π c²) multiplied by 1/( |d| - (v · t̂) ), where t̂ is the unit vector in the direction of d. Wait, perhaps more accurately, it's (μ₀ q v )/(4π) * (1/|d|) ) × (1/(1 - (v·d̂)/c²)) )? Or maybe the denominator is (|d| c - d·v). Because when you have time delays, the denominator often ends up being (r c - v t), but in terms of the vector d, it's (d c - v·d) ?

Wait, let me think again. The general expression for the scalar potential is:

V(r, t) = [ q/(4πε₀) ] * [ 1/( |r - s(tr)| ) ] * [1/(1 - (v · r̂)/c² ) ]

But wait, maybe that's not quite right. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact form.

Alternatively, for a charge moving with velocity v at time tr, the potentials are:

V(r, t) = ( q/(4πε₀ |d| ) ) * ( c² / ( c² - v² ) )^(1/2) )? Or perhaps not. Alternatively, I think the scalar potential might not have any velocity factor and is just the static potential evaluated at the retarded position. So V = q/(4πε₀ |d| ).

Wait, but when the charge is moving, does the scalar potential include a factor? Or is it just the same as the static case, evaluated at the retarded time? I think it might be just the static expression because the scalar potential is due to the charge's electric field, which depends on the charge's position at the retarded time. So V would be q/(4πε₀ |d| ).

For the vector potential A, it's a bit more involved. The vector potential is given by the integral over the charge's history, but for a charge moving with a constant velocity, the integral simplifies. The expression I think is:

A(r, t) = ( (μ₀ q v )/(4π) ) * [ 1/( |d| ( c² - (v · d̂ ) c ) ) ]

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think: the denominator probably involves (c^2 t_r - v \cdot r), but in this case, t_r is the retarded time. Alternatively, using d = r - s(tr), the denominator might be (c^2 |d| - v · d).

Wait, another approach: the potentials are given by:

V(r, t) = [ q/(4πε₀) ] * ( 1 / |d| ) * (1 + (v · d̂)/(c²) )^{-1} )

But no, that seems too simplistic. Alternatively, perhaps the potentials are as follows:

V(r, t) = ( q c )/(4πε₀ ( c |d| - v · d )) )

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the denominator is (c |d| - v · d ), but I'm not certain.

Wait, looking at the options, let's consider each option.

Option A: V is q/(4πε₀ r), A is (v²/c²) V. Hmm, but r is |d|, so V is as I thought. But the vector potential here is (v squared) times V over c squared. That seems suspect because the units might not match. Vector potential has units of (velocity * magnetic field?), but I'm not sure.

Option B: V same as A, and A is v/c² times V. So V is q/(4πε₀ |d| ), A is (v/(c²)) * V. So A is μ₀ q v/(4π |d| c² ), since V is q/(4πε₀ |d| ), so multiplying by v/(c²), A would be (q v)/(4 π ε₀ c² |d| ). But the units for A should be (velocity * (unit of B)) or perhaps (current times area), but I'm not sure. Also, I remember that the vector potential A is usually proportional to velocity and the charge, and inversely proportional to c squared.

Option C: V is ( q c )/(4πε₀ (d c - d · v) ), and A is (μ₀ q c v )/(4π (d c - d · v) ). Wait, the denominator is (d c - v · d), which is a scalar. Let me see, d is a vector, so d c is (c * d), but that's a vector. Wait, no, the way it's written in option C, is it (d c - v · d) or [d c - (v · d)]? Wait, no, the denominator is written as (d c - vec{d} . vec{v}), which would be a scalar. Because d is a vector, so d c is a vector multiplied by a scalar (c), and vec{d} . vec{v} is a scalar. So d c - vec{d} . vec{v} would be a vector minus a scalar, which doesn't make sense. Oh wait, no, perhaps it's written as (d c - (vec{d} · vec{v}) ), but that's a scalar. Wait, perhaps it's (d c - (vec{d} · vec{v})) which is a scalar, which would be in the denominator. So the denominator is (c |d| - (vec{d} · vec{v}) ), because vec{d} · vec{v} is |d| v cosθ, where θ is the angle between d and v. So that's a scalar.

So for option C, V is ( q c )/(4 π ε₀ (c |d| - (vec{d} · vec{v})) ), and A is ( μ₀ q c vec{v} )/(4 π (c |d| - (vec{d} · vec{v})) ). Hmm, that seems plausible. Because the denominator is (c |d| - (d · v)), which is (c r' - v · d ), where r' is |d|. Let me think about the units. For V, the units would be (C) * (m/s) / [ (F/m)^{-1} m ] → since ε₀ is F/m. Wait, let me compute the units for V in option C.

V units: [q] is Coulombs (C). [ε₀] is F/m (C²·s⁴/(kg·m³)). So 1/(4πε₀) has units (kg·m³)/(C²·s⁴). Multiply by (c) → m/s, so (kg·m³ * m/s ) / (C²·s⁴) → kg·m^4/(C² s^5). Denominator is (c |d| - d · v), which is in meters. So overall, V has units (kg·m^4/(C² s^5)) * 1/m → kg·m³/(C² s^5). Wait, but the unit of electric potential is J/C → kg·m²/(C·s²). Hmm, that doesn't match. So perhaps option C's units for V are incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the unit analysis. Let me try again. The denominator in V for option C is (c |d| - d · v) → m. So V's units are (C * m/s ) / [ (C²/(N·m²)) * m ] → Hmm, perhaps another approach: 1/(4πε₀) has units of N·m²/C². So, (q c) has units (C)(m/s), and denominator is (m).

So overall, V has units (C·m/s) / ( (N m²/C²) * m ) ) → (C m/s) / (N m^3/C²) ) → (C^3 m/s) / (N m^3) ) → (C^3)/(N m^2 s)). Since N is kg m/s²: (C^3) / ( (kg m/s² ) m^2 s ) ) → C^3 s/(kg m^3 s² )) → C^3/(kg m^3 s). Wait, which doesn't match the unit for potential (J/C = kg m²/(C s²)), so perhaps option C is incorrect in units, but maybe I'm not calculating correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check option D.

Option D: V is (q c)/(4 π ε₀ (d c + vec{d} · vec{v} )) ), and A is (μ₀ q c vec{v} )/(4 π (d c + vec{d} · vec{v} )) ). So the denominator here is (c |d| + (d · v)). Hmm, considering that d · v is v |d| cosθ. If the charge is moving towards the observer, then d and v are in the same direction, so d · v is positive. So the denominator would be c |d| + (d · v), which is larger than c |d|, making V smaller. But I'm not sure. Wait, but for a charge moving towards the observer, the potential might be more complicated.

Wait, looking back, I think the correct expressions for the potentials when considering a charge moving with velocity v at the retarded time would involve a denominator of (c |d| - (v · d̂) |d| ), but perhaps written as (c |d| - v · d ). Because d is the vector from the charge's position to the field point, so it's in the direction from charge to r. So the term (v · d) is (v |d| cosθ), where θ is the angle between v and d.

But getting back to the potentials. The scalar potential is usually given by V = ( q/(4 π ε₀) ) * (1/|d| ) * [1/(1 - (v · d̂)/c² ) ].

Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct expressions are:

V(r, t) = [ q/(4 π ε₀) ] * [ 1/( |d| (1 - (v · d̂)/c² )) ]

A(r, t) = [ (μ₀ q v )/(4 π) ] * [ 1/( |d| (1 - (v · d̂)/c² )) ]

But looking at the options, none of them directly match this. Let me see the options again.

Option C: V = ( q c )/(4 π ε₀ (d c - d · v) ), and A = ( μ₀ q c v )/(4 π (d c - d · v) )

So for V, denominator is (d c - d · v ), which is a scalar, as d is a vector and v is a vector. Wait, no, d c is a vector multiplied by scalar c, so it's a vector. Then subtracting the scalar (d · v ), that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, no, I think the denominator in option C is written as (d c - (d · v) ), which would be a vector minus a scalar, which is impossible. So perhaps there's a typo in the way it's written.

Wait, looking again, the option C for V is ( q c )/(4πε₀ (d c - vec{d} · vec{v}) ), and similarly for A. Wait, perhaps it's not a subtraction of a vector and a scalar. It must be a scalar denominator. So perhaps the denominator is (c|d| - (d · v) ), since d · v is a scalar. So option C's denominator is (c |d| - (vec{d} · vec{v}) ), which is a scalar.

So V would be ( q c )/(4 π ε₀ (c |d| - (d · v )) ), and A is ( μ₀ q c v )/(4 π (c |d| - (d · v )) )

Hmm, but why is there a c in the numerator of V? Because in the static case, V is q/(4 π ε₀ |d| ). So including a factor of c in the numerator would change the units. For V, the units should be volts (J/C). Let's see: [q] is C, [c] is m/s, [ε₀] is F/m (C² s^4/(kg m^3)), and denominator is (m - (m·m/s )). Wait, no, denominator is (m (c) - (m· (m/s )) ), which is in meters. So numerator: C * m/s. Denominator: m.

So V's unit is (C m/s )/ m → C/s → which is current. But that can't be right because V should be in volts (J/C). So this must be wrong. So option C can't be correct because the units don't match.

Looking at option D: V is ( q c )/(4 π ε₀ (d c + d · v ) ), and A is ( μ₀ q c v )/(4 π (d c + d · v ) )

Again, denominator is (c |d| + (d ·v )). Let's check the units for V. (C * m/s ) / ( m ) → C/s again. Which is incorrect. So option D also has incorrect units for V.

Hmm, so options C and D have V with units of C/s, which is incorrect. So they are probably wrong.

Going back to options A and B.

Option A: V is q/(4 π ε₀ r ), which is correct for the static case, but in our case, r is |d|, which is correct. A is (v²/c²) V. So A would have units of (m²/s²)/(m²/s²) ) * volts → volts, which is not correct because A is a vector potential, which has units of T·m² (or Wb/m²). Wait, let's see: [V] is volts (J/C). [A] would be [V] * (s²/m²) → (J/C * s²/m² ). Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, let me think in terms of the formulas.

If V is correct as in option B and A, but then A is v/(c²) * V. Let's check units for A in option B.

V has units of volts: J/C.

v has units m/s.

c is m/s. So v/(c²) has units 1/(m/s) ), which is s/m. So (v/(c²)) * V would have units (s/m) * (J/C ), but J is kg m²/s². So (s/m) * (kg m²/(C s² )) ) → kg m / (C s² ). Hmm, not sure if that's correct.

Alternatively, in the case of option B, the vector potential is (v/(c²)) V. So if V is in volts, then A would have units (m/s)/(m²/s²) ) * volts → (s m )/(m²) ) * V → s/(m) * V.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the actual expressions for the potentials.

The scalar potential is given by:

V(r, t) = (1/(4πε₀)) * ∫ (ρ(r', t') ) / |r - r'| dt'

But for a moving point charge, the charge density ρ is a delta function, and the integral simplifies to q/(4 π ε₀ |d| ), where |d| is the distance at the retarded time.

So V is q/(4 π ε₀ |d| ), which is option B's V.

For the vector potential, the expression is:

A(r, t) = (μ₀/(4π)) ∫ ( J(r', t') × (r - r') ) / |r - r'|² dt'

But for a point charge moving with velocity v at time t', the current density J is ρ v, which is (q δ³(r' - s(t')) ) v. So the integral becomes (μ₀ q v)/(4π) ∫ [ (r - s(t')) ) × (1/|r - s(t')|² ) ] dt'

But this integral is evaluated along the path of the charge. For a charge moving at a constant velocity, the integral simplifies. 

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, I think that the vector potential for a charge moving with velocity v is given by:

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q v )/(4π c²) * (1/(1 - (v·d̂)/c² )) ) * (d̂ )

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, for a charge moving with velocity v, the vector potential can be written as:

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q v )/(4π c²) * (1/|d| ) * [ 1/(1 - (v·d̂)/c² ) ] 

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, from the theory, the vector potential due to a charge moving at velocity v is:

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c²) (1/(1 - (v·d̂)/c² )) * (1/|d| )

But I'm not confident about this.

Wait, another approach: the potentials are related by the Lorenz gauge condition. The Lorenz gauge condition is ∇·A + (1/c²) ∂V/∂t = 0. But perhaps that's not directly helpful here.

Alternatively, if I recall, the vector potential A is given by (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c²) (1/(1 - (v·d̂)/c² )) * (d̂ )

Which would make A a vector in the direction of d, scaled by that factor.

But let's look again at the options. Option B says A is (v/c²) V. So let's compute the units. V has units of volts (V), which is J/C. v has units m/s, c^2 is m²/s². So v/c² is (m/s)/(m²/s²) )= s/(m). So (v/c²) V has units (s/m) * (J/C) )= (kg m²/(C s²)) * (s/m) )= kg m/(C s²).

What's the unit for A? The vector potential has units of T·m² (tesla times square meter), and tesla is kg/(s² C), so T·m² is kg m²/(s² C), which matches the units I just found. So the units for option B's A are correct.

So if V is correct as in option B, and A is (v/c²) V, which has correct units, then option B could be correct.

But wait, looking back, in option B, V is q/(4π ε₀ |d| ), and A is (v/(c²)) V. So A would be (v q )/(4 π ε₀ c² |d| ). But the standard expression for A should involve μ₀ instead of ε₀. Because A is related to B, which is μ₀ times something.

Wait, because the expression for the vector potential in terms of current would involve μ₀. Let me think. The vector potential is given by:

A(r, t) = (μ₀/(4π)) ∫ ( J(r', t') × (r - r') ) / |r - r'|² dt'

For a point charge, J is ρ v = q δ³(r' - s(tr)) ) v.

So perhaps the vector potential would involve μ₀. So looking at the options, option B's A is (v/c²) V. V is (1/(4π ε₀)) (q/|d| ), so (v/c²) V would be (v q)/(4 π ε₀ c² |d| ). But the correct expression for A should involve μ₀, not ε₀.

So option B's A would have 1/ε₀, but it should be μ₀. So that's a problem.

Looking back, option C's A is (μ₀ q c v )/(4 π (d c - d · v ) ). Let me compute the units for A in option C.

Numerator: μ₀ has units of H/m (kg m/(s² A²)). q is C, c is m/s, v is m/s. So numerator units: (kg m/(s² A²)) * C * (m/s) * (m/s) → kg m/(s² A²) * C m²/s².

Denominator: (m * c - (m * (m/s)) ) → m^2/s. Wait, not sure. Wait, denominator is (c |d| - (d · v) ), which is a scalar. Let's assume it's in meters, because |d| is m, c is m/s, so c |d| is m*(m/s) → no, wait, no, c is m/s. So c |d| is (m/s)*m → m²/s. And d·v is (m)(m/s) → m²/s. So denominator is (m²/s - m²/s) → m²/s. So denominator is m²/s.

So overall, A's units in option C are [ (kg m/(s² A²)) * C m²/s² ) ] / (m²/s) ) → (kg m/(s² A²) * C m²/s² ) * s/m² → kg C / (s² A²) * m²/(s²) ) * s/m² → Wait, perhaps another approach.

Wait, the denominator in option C is (c |d| - (d · v) ), which is a scalar. Let me not get stuck on units but look for the presence of μ₀.

Option C: A = (μ₀ q c v ) / (4 π (c |d| - (d · v )) )

So if V is (q c)/(4 π ε₀ (c |d| - (d ·v )) ), then A is (μ₀ c v )/(4 π (c |d| -d ·v )) ) * (q)/(4 π ε₀ (c |d| -d ·v )) ) * something? No, I think I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct expressions involve both ε₀ and μ₀, since the potentials are related to the fields, which involve both permittivity and permeability.

Wait, another approach: the potentials satisfy Maxwell's equations. The electric field is E = -∇V - ∂A/∂t.

The magnetic field is B = ∇×A.

But perhaps I should think in terms of the potentials for a moving charge. The scalar potential is V(r,t) = q/(4π ε₀) * 1/(r'), where r' is the distance at the retarded time. The vector potential is A(r,t) = (μ₀ q v)/(4π c²) * 1/(r') * (1/(1 - (v · r̂)/c² )) ), where r̂ is the unit vector in the direction of r'.

So let me write r' as |d|, and the term (v · r̂ ) is v cosθ, where θ is the angle between v and d.

So the denominator would be 1 - (v cosθ)/c.

So the vector potential becomes:

A = (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c²) * (1/|d| ) * (1/(1 - (v cosθ)/c )) )

= (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c² |d| ) * [ 1 / (1 - (v · d̂ )/c ) ]

Which can be written as (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c² |d| ) * 1/(1 - (v · d̂ )/c )

But looking at the options, none of them exactly match this, but perhaps we can manipulate it.

Wait, let me note that 1/(1 - (v · d̂ )/c ) = 1/( (c - v cosθ )/c ) ) = c/(c - v cosθ )

So putting it back into A:

A = (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c² |d| ) * c/(c - (v cosθ ) )

= (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c |d| ) * 1/(c - (v cosθ ) )

But (c - (v cosθ )) is ( c |d| - (v · d ) ) / |d|, since v · d = v |d| cosθ.

So,

A = (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c |d| ) * |d|/( c |d| - (v · d ) )

= (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c ( c |d| - (v · d ) ) )

Which simplifies to:

A = (μ₀ q v c )/(4 π ( c² |d| - c v · d ) )

Wait, no, let me compute that again. Because (c |d| - (v · d )) is the denominator. So:

A = (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c |d| ) * |d|/( c |d| - (v · d ) )

The |d| in the denominator cancels with the |d| in the numerator, so:

A = (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c ) * 1/( c |d| - (v · d ) )

= (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c ( c |d| - (v · d ) ) )

Hmm, that's not matching any of the options.

Wait, looking back at option C: 

A = (μ₀ q c v )/(4 π ( c |d| - (v · d ) ) )

In this case, the denominator is same as what I have. But in option C, it's (μ₀ q c v )/(4 π ( c |d| - (v · d ) ) )

Which would be:

A = (μ₀ q c v )/(4 π ( c |d| - (v · d ) ) )

But according to my derivation, A is (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c ( c |d| - (v · d ) ) ) )

So the numerator in option C is μ₀ q c v, whereas mine is μ₀ q v / c.

So option C has an extra factor of c in the numerator. So that must be incorrect.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in my derivation. Let me go back.

The vector potential is A = (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c²) * [ 1/(1 - (v · r̂ )/c ) ] * (r̂ ) / |d| ?

Wait, no, I think I might have included an incorrect term. Let me consider the integral form of the vector potential. For a charge moving with velocity v, the vector potential at r and t is:

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q)/(4 π c²) * v × (r - s(tr)) / |r - s(tr)|² evaluated at the retarded time.

Wait, that's not quite right. The vector potential formula is:

A(r, t) = (1/(4 π ε₀ c² )) ∫ ( J(r', t') × (r - r') ) / |r - r'| dt'

But J is q δ³(r' - s(tr)) v, so:

A(r, t) = (1/(4 π ε₀ c² )) * [ q v × (r - s(tr)) / |r - s(tr)|² ] evaluated at tr.

Since (r - s(tr)) is d, we have:

A = ( q v × d )/(4 π ε₀ c² |d|² )

But because v × d is a vector, and we need to express A in terms of d and v, which are vectors. Hmm, perhaps I'm not on the right track here.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct expression for the vector potential is:

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c² ) * (1/(1 - (v · d̂ )/c )) * d̂ / |d|

Which would be:

A = (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c² ) * (1/(1 - (v · d̂ )/c )) * (d/|d| )

= (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c² ) * (d / |d| ) * (1/(1 - (v · d̂ )/c ) )

But I'm not sure how this relates to the options given. Let me see what option C says.

Option C: A = ( μ₀ q c v )/(4 π (d c - (d · v )) )

= (μ₀ q c v )/(4 π (c |d| - (d · v )) )

Wait, if I factor out |d| from the denominator, it becomes:

A = ( μ₀ q c v )/(4 π |d| ( c - (d · v ) / |d| ) )

But (d · v ) / |d| is v cosθ, so:

A = ( μ₀ q c v )/(4 π |d| ( c - v cosθ ) )

Which can be written as:

A = ( μ₀ q c v )/(4 π |d| (c - (v · d̂ ) c ) )

Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should give up and realize that the correct option is B, because A is expressed as (v/c²) V, which has the correct units and incorporates the velocity.

Wait, but earlier I noted that option B's expression for A has 1/ε₀, whereas it should have μ₀. So perhaps option B is incorrect.

Hmmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let me think about the potentials when the charge is stationary. If the charge is stationary, then v=0, so A should be zero. So looking at the options:

Option A: A = v²/c² V → when v=0, A=0. Correct.

Option B: A = v/c² V → when v=0, A=0. Correct.

Option C: A = (μ₀ q c v )/(4 π (c |d| - (d ·v )) ) → v=0 → A=0. Correct.

Option D: same as C, but denominator is + instead of -, but when v=0, A=0. So all options A-D have A=0 when v=0, which is correct.

So that doesn't help eliminate any options.

What about when the charge moves with speed v much less than c? Then we can use a non-relativistic approximation. So let's make the approximation that v << c.

In this case, the denominator (c |d| - (d ·v )) ≈ c |d| (1 - (v · d̂ )/c )

Because (d ·v ) = v |d| cosθ = v c |d| cosθ, assuming c is a constant. Wait, no, |d| is a fixed distance. So (d · v ) = v |d| cosθ.

So denominator is c |d| (1 - (v cosθ )/(c) )

So, in the non-relativistic limit, the potentials would be approximated as:

V ≈ q/(4 π ε₀ |d| ) * [1 + (v cosθ )/(c²) ]

A ≈ (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c² |d| ) * [1 + (v cosθ )/(c²) ]

But looking at the options, when v<<c, how do they behave?

Option B: V is q/(4 π ε₀ |d| ), A is (v/c²) V → A ≈ (v q )/(4 π ε₀ c² |d| )

But in the non-relativistic limit, the vector potential A should have a term proportional to v/(c²) times something, so this seems consistent. Wait, but earlier I thought option B's A has ε₀ where it should have μ₀. But perhaps in the non-relativistic limit, some terms can be approximated using ε₀ and μ₀.

Wait, but in the non-relativistic case, the vector potential is usually:

A = (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c² |d| )

Which is option B's A only if μ₀/(4 π c² ) is equal to 1/(4 π ε₀ c² ), which would require μ₀ = 1/ε₀, but μ₀ ε₀ = 1/c². So unless μ₀ =1/(ε₀ c² ), which is not the case, these can't be equal. So option B's A can't be correct because it has 1/ε₀ instead of μ₀.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. I think I'm stuck, but I'll make a educated guess. The correct answer is option C, because it includes both ε₀ and μ₀ correctly, and the denominator is structured correctly with (c |d| - (d · v )). The vector potential in option C has the correct dependence on μ₀ and q, and the numerator has v, which makes sense because the vector potential depends on the charge's velocity.

Wait, but earlier when I checked the units for option C, V had incorrect units. So I'm confused. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit analysis.

Wait, let's recheck option C's V:

V = ( q c )/(4 π ε₀ (c |d| - (d · v )) )

Units: q is C, c is m/s. ε₀ has units F/m = C² s⁴/(kg m³). So denominator is (m/s * m) - (m²/s ), which is m²/s - m²/s → denominator is in m²/s.

So numerator: C * m/s.

Denominator: m²/s.

So overall, V has units (C m/s )/( m²/s ) ) → C/(m ). But the unit for V should be volts (J/C = kg m²/(C s²) ). So C/(m) is not matching. So option C's V has incorrect units. So option C can't be correct.

Hmm. So I'm really stuck. Let me think about the standard expressions.

The usual expressions for the potentials of a moving charge:

The scalar potential is:

V(r, t) = (q / (4 π ε₀ )) * [ 1 / |r - r_tr| ] * [ 1 / (1 - (v · r̂ )/c² ) ]

Wait, no, actually, the scalar potential for a moving charge is given by (using the Lienard potential expressions):

V(r, t) = (q/(4 π ε₀ )) * [ 1/( |d| ) ] * [ 1/(1 - (v · d̂ )/c ) ]

Wait, but this doesn't seem right either because the denominator would then have units of velocity. I'm getting confused again.

Alternatively, the correct expression for V is:

V(r, t) = (q/(4 π ε₀ |d| )) * [ 1/(1 - (v · d̂ )/c² ) ]

And for A:

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c² |d| ) * [ 1/(1 - (v · d̂ )/c² ) ]

So combining, V and A share the same factor [1/(1 - (v · d̂ )/c² ) ].

Looking at the options, none of them exactly match this. But perhaps when we factor in the denominator, which is (c |d| - (d · v ) ), we can write:

[1/(1 - (v · d̂ )/c² ) ] = [ c² ] / [ c² - (v · d̂ ) |d| ]

= c² / ( c |d| - (d · v ) )

Because (v · d̂ ) |d| = (v · d )

So, putting it into V:

V = ( q/(4 π ε₀ |d| ) ) * [ c²/( c |d| - (d · v ) ) ]

= ( q c² )/(4 π ε₀ ( c |d| - (d · v ) ) |d| )

Wait, but that's getting complicated, and none of the options have this form.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but the options for V in C and D are:

C: V = (q c )/(4 π ε₀ (c |d| - (d · v )) )

D: V = (q c )/(4 π ε₀ (c |d| + (d · v )) )

But from the Lienard expressions, the scalar potential V has a denominator that includes (c² - v² ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option B, because A is expressed as (v/c²) V, which makes sense dimensionally, and V is correct as the static potential.

But earlier I thought that option B's A has 1/ε₀ instead of μ₀, which is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the vector potential is expressed via ε₀ as well, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the vector potential is related to the magnetic field. The magnetic field B is given by B = ∇ × A. For a moving charge, B is (μ₀ q (v × r̂ ) )/(4 π c² |r|² ) (1/(1 - (v · r̂ )/c² ) )

So, to get B, you need A to have terms with μ₀ and v.

Looking at option C's A, it's ( μ₀ q c v )/(4 π (c |d| - (d · v )) )

If I write A as ( μ₀ q v )/(4 π c (c |d| - (d ·v )) ), that would make sense, as it would factor in the c correctly.

But option C has an extra c in the numerator, so it can't be the right expression.

Hmm, this is taking way too long, and I'm not making progress. I'll have to make an educated guess.

Based on the earlier analysis, option C's V has incorrect units, so it's probably wrong. Option B's A has the correct form (v/c²) V, but the wrong constants (using ε₀ instead of μ₀). But none of the options have both correct ε₀ and μ₀ in their expressions.

Wait, another approach: the Maxwell equations. The scalar potential satisfies ∇² V = - (ρ/ε₀ ), and the vector potential satisfies ∇² A = -μ₀ J. So, given that J for a moving charge is q v δ³(r - s(t)), the potentials would incorporate these constants.

But I'm not sure how that helps now.

I think I've exhausted my options and need to choose the best possible answer. Based on process of elimination, I'll go with option C because it includes both ε₀ and μ₀ correctly, and the denominator seems to align with the retarded time expression.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the scalar potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) and vector potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \) for a moving point charge \( q \) at a field point \( \vec{r} \) at time \( t \), where \( t > t_r \) (with \( t_r \) being the retarded time). The vector \( \vec{d} \) represents the displacement from the charge's position at \( t_r \) to the observation point \( \vec{r} \), and \( \vec{v} \) is the velocity of the charge at \( t_r \). The goal is to identify the correct expressions for \( V \) and \( \vec{A} \) from the given options.

### Key Analysis of the Potentials

1. **Scalar Potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - The scalar potential is generally derived from the electric field and is influenced by the retarded time due to the motion of the charge. For a static charge, \( V \) is given by \( V = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 |\vec{d}|} \), where \( |\vec{d}| \) is the distance between the charge and the observation point at \( t_r \). When the charge is moving, relativistic corrections may arise, but the denominator often involves terms like \( c|\vec{d}| - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \), where \( c \) is the speed of light.
   - Option A and B suggest \( V = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 |\vec{d}|} \), which is correct for the static case but does not account for relativistic corrections. Options C and D include the term \( c|\vec{d}| - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) in the denominator, which is consistent with relativistic effects.

2. **Vector Potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - The vector potential is derived from the magnetic field and depends on the velocity \( \vec{v} \) of the charge. It typically involves \( \mu_0 \), the permeability of free space, and is proportional to \( \vec{v} \). The denominator often matches the structure of the scalar potential, incorporating terms like \( c|\vec{d}| - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \).
   - Option A suggests \( \vec{A} = \frac{\vec{v}^2}{c^2} V \), which is dimensionally inconsistent because \( \vec{A} \) is a vector and \( \vec{v}^2 \) is a scalar. Option B suggests \( \vec{A} = \frac{\vec{v}}{c^2} V \), which has the correct units but lacks the proper inclusion of \( \mu_0 \). Options C and D include \( \mu_0 \) and have the correct structure for \( \vec{A} \), but their expressions for \( V \) were found to have incorrect units.

3. **Critical Evaluation of Options:**
   - **Option A:** Incorrect because \( \vec{A} = \frac{\vec{v}^2}{c^2} V \) is dimensionally inconsistent.
   - **Option B:** While \( V \) is correct for the static case, \( \vec{A} = \frac{\vec{v}}{c^2} V \) does not include \( \mu_0 \), which is necessary for the vector potential.
   - **Option C:** \( V \) was found to have incorrect units, as the numerator \( qc \) introduces a factor that does not align with the standard units for potential. However, \( \vec{A} \) includes \( \mu_0 \) and has the correct structure.
   - **Option D:** Similar to Option C, but the denominator \( c|\vec{d}| + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) is inconsistent with the expected form for relativistic corrections.

### Conclusion
After evaluating the options, Option C is selected as the best choice. While its expression for \( V \) has questionable units, it correctly incorporates \( \mu_0 \) in \( \vec{A} \) and aligns with the expected structure of the potentials for a moving charge.

**Answer: C**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. The setup is that a charge q is moving along a trajectory s(t), and we're looking at the potentials at a field point r at time t. The vector d is from the point where the field was generated at time tr (which is earlier than t) to the observation point r. The velocity at the generating time tr is v.

So, the question is asking what are the expressions for the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at time t. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different forms for V and A.

Hmm, I remember that potentials in electromagnetism are usually derived from the fields. The scalar potential V is related to the electric field E, and the vector potential A is related to the magnetic field B. The fields are due to a moving charge, which means we might be dealing with retarded potentials because the charge is moving, and the fields depend on where the charge was some time ago.

Right, the retarded time concept comes into play when the source is moving. The potentials are evaluated at the retarded time tr, which is the time it would take for the influence of the charge to reach the observation point. So, tr = t - r/c, where r is the distance between the charge's position at tr and the observation point r. But wait, in this problem, they've already defined d as the vector from the field generating point (at tr) to r. So, d would be the displacement vector from the charge's position at tr to the point r. So, the magnitude of d is |d|, and if I think about r, it's probably |r - s(tr)|, but since d is defined as r - s(tr), then |d| is the distance between the charge and the field point at time tr.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. The charge is at position s(tr) at time tr. The observation point is r. So, the vector from the charge's position to r is d = r - s(tr). So, the distance is |d|, and the time it takes for the charge's influence to reach r is tr = t - |d|/c. So, the charge's position at tr is s(tr), and the observation point is at r at time t.

Now, the potentials. I think the general expressions for the potentials due to a moving charge are as follows. The scalar potential V is given by (1/(4πε₀)) times q over the distance, but considering the retarded time. So, V(r, t) = q/(4πε₀) * (1/|d|). Wait, no, because |d| is the distance from the charge at tr to r, which is correct. So V is similar to the static case but evaluated at tr. So V would be V(r, t) = q/(4πε₀ |d|) * (1/(1 - (v·d̂)/c²)) ), but wait, perhaps that's when considering the Lorentz contraction. Alternatively, I recall that potentials for a moving charge might have some factors involving the velocity.

Wait, no, perhaps for potentials, the scalar potential is just V = q/(4πε₀ r'), where r' is the distance at the retarded time. So r' is |d|, because d is the vector from the charge's position (at tr) to r. So V would be q/(4πε₀ |d|). 

What about the vector potential A? The vector potential is given by A = (μ₀ q v)/(4π) times some function. I think the vector potential for a moving charge is given by A = (μ₀ q v)/(4π c²) (1/(1 - (v·d̂)/c²) )) or something along those lines. Wait, but maybe I'm mixing this up.

Wait, another approach. The potentials are calculated using the retarded potentials formulas. The scalar potential V is (q/(4πε₀)) * (1/|r - s(tr)|) ) * [1/(1 - (v·r̂)/c²)]^(-1) ? Or perhaps it's without that term. Wait, no, I think the scalar potential is simpler. Because the scalar potential is due to the charge's electric field, but when the charge is moving, the expression might involve a factor due to the motion. Alternatively, perhaps the potentials are as follows:

V(r, t) = [ q/(4πε₀) ] * [ 1/( |d| ) ] 

And the vector potential A is [ (μ₀ q v)/(4π) ] [ 1/( |d| ) ] multiplied by some function. Wait, let's think about the expression for A. 

I remember that the vector potential A is given by (μ₀ q)/(4π c²) ∫ (v' × r') dt', but for a point charge, the integral simplifies. Alternatively, for a charge moving with velocity v at time tr, the vector potential at r and t would be (μ₀ q v )/(4π c²) multiplied by 1/( |d| - (v · t̂) ), where t̂ is the unit vector in the direction of d. Wait, perhaps more accurately, it's (μ₀ q v )/(4π) * (1/|d|) ) × (1/(1 - (v·d̂)/c²)) )? Or maybe the denominator is (|d| c - d·v). Because when you have time delays, the denominator often ends up being (r c - v t), but in terms of the vector d, it's (d c - v·d) ?

Wait, let me think again. The general expression for the scalar potential is:

V(r, t) = [ q/(4πε₀) ] * [ 1/( |r - s(tr)| ) ] * [1/(1 - (v · r̂)/c² ) ]

But wait, maybe that's not quite right. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact form.

Alternatively, for a charge moving with velocity v at time tr, the potentials are:

V(r, t) = ( q/(4πε₀ |d| ) ) * ( c² / ( c² - v² ) )^(1/2) )? Or perhaps not. Alternatively, I think the scalar potential might not have any velocity factor and is just the static potential evaluated at the retarded position. So V = q/(4πε₀ |d| ).

Wait, but when the charge is moving, does the scalar potential include a factor? Or is it just the same as the static case, evaluated at the retarded time? I think it might be just the static expression because the scalar potential is due to the charge's electric field, which depends on the charge's position at the retarded time. So V would be q/(4πε₀ |d| ).

For the vector potential A, it's a bit more involved. The vector potential is given by the integral over the charge's history, but for a charge moving with a constant velocity, the integral simplifies. The expression I think is:

A(r, t) = ( (μ₀ q v )/(4π) ) * [ 1/( |d| ( c² - (v · d̂ ) c ) ) ]

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think: the denominator probably involves (c^2 t_r - v \cdot r), but in this case, t_r is the retarded time. Alternatively, using d = r - s(tr), the denominator might be (c^2 |d| - v · d).

Wait, another approach: the potentials are given by:

V(r, t) = [ q/(4πε₀) ] * ( 1 / |d| ) * (1 + (v · d̂)/(c²) )^{-1} )

But no, that seems too simplistic. Alternatively, perhaps the potentials are as follows:

V(r, t) = ( q c )/(4πε₀ ( c |d| - v · d )) )

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the denominator is (c |d| - v · d ), but I'm not certain.

Wait, looking at the options, let's consider each option.

Option A: V is q/(4πε₀ r), A is (v²/c²) V. Hmm, but r is |d|, so V is as I thought. But the vector potential here is (v squared) times V over c squared. That seems suspect because the units might not match. Vector potential has units of (velocity * magnetic field?), but I'm not sure.

Option B: V same as A, and A is v/c² times V. So V is q/(4πε₀ |d| ), A is (v/(c²)) * V. So A is μ₀ q v/(4π |d| c² ), since V is q/(4πε₀ |d| ), so multiplying by v/(c²), A would be (q v)/(4 π ε₀ c² |d| ). But the units for A should be (velocity * (unit of B)) or perhaps (current times area), but I'm not sure. Also, I remember that the vector potential A is usually proportional to velocity and the charge, and inversely proportional to c squared.

Option C: V is ( q c )/(4πε₀ (d c - d · v) ), and A is (μ₀ q c v )/(4π (d c - d · v) ). Wait, the denominator is (d c - v · d), which is a scalar. Let me see, d is a vector, so d c is (c * d), but that's a vector. Wait, no, the way it's written in option C, is it (d c - v · d) or [d c - (v · d)]? Wait, no, the denominator is written as (d c - vec{d} . vec{v}), which would be a scalar. Because d is a vector, so d c is a vector multiplied by a scalar (c), and vec{d} . vec{v} is a scalar. So d c - vec{d} . vec{v} would be a vector minus a scalar, which doesn't make sense. Oh wait, no, perhaps it's written as (d c - (vec{d} · vec{v}) ), but that's a scalar. Wait, perhaps it's (d c - (vec{d} · vec{v})) which is a scalar, which would be in the denominator. So the denominator is (c |d| - (vec{d} · vec{v}) ), because vec{d} · vec{v} is |d| v cosθ, where θ is the angle between d and v. So that's a scalar.

So for option C, V is ( q c )/(4 π ε₀ (c |d| - (vec{d} · vec{v})) ), and A is ( μ₀ q c vec{v} )/(4 π (c |d| - (vec{d} · vec{v})) ). Hmm, that seems plausible. Because the denominator is (c |d| - (d · v)), which is (c r' - v · d ), where r' is |d|. Let me think about the units. For V, the units would be (C) * (m/s) / [ (F/m)^{-1} m ] → since ε₀ is F/m. Wait, let me compute the units for V in option C.

V units: [q] is Coulombs (C). [ε₀] is F/m (C²·s⁴/(kg·m³)). So 1/(4πε₀) has units (kg·m³)/(C²·s⁴). Multiply by (c) → m/s, so (kg·m³ * m/s ) / (C²·s⁴) → kg·m^4/(C² s^5). Denominator is (c |d| - d · v), which is in meters. So overall, V has units (kg·m^4/(C² s^5)) * 1/m → kg·m³/(C² s^5). Wait, but the unit of electric potential is J/C → kg·m²/(C·s²). Hmm, that doesn't match. So perhaps option C's units for V are incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the unit analysis. Let me try again. The denominator in V for option C is (c |d| - d · v) → m. So V's units are (C * m/s ) / [ (C²/(N·m²)) * m ] → Hmm, perhaps another approach: 1/(4πε₀) has units of N·m²/C². So, (q c) has units (C)(m/s), and denominator is (m).

So overall, V has units (C·m/s) / ( (N m²/C²) * m ) ) → (C m/s) / (N m^3/C²) ) → (C^3 m/s) / (N m^3) ) → (C^3)/(N m^2 s)). Since N is kg m/s²: (C^3) / ( (kg m/s² ) m^2 s ) ) → C^3 s/(kg m^3 s² )) → C^3/(kg m^3 s). Wait, which doesn't match the unit for potential (J/C = kg m²/(C s²)), so perhaps option C is incorrect in units, but maybe I'm not calculating correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check option D.

Option D: V is (q c)/(4 π ε₀ (d c + vec{d} · vec{v} )) ), and A is (μ₀ q c vec{v} )/(4 π (d c + vec{d} · vec{v} )) ). So the denominator here is (c |d| + (d · v)). Hmm, considering that d · v is v |d| cosθ. If the charge is moving towards the observer, then d and v are in the same direction, so d · v is positive. So the denominator would be c |d| + (d · v), which is larger than c |d|, making V smaller. But I'm not sure. Wait, but for a charge moving towards the observer, the potential might be more complicated.

Wait, looking back, I think the correct expressions for the potentials when considering a charge moving with velocity v at the retarded time would involve a denominator of (c |d| - (v · d̂) |d| ), but perhaps written as (c |d| - v · d ). Because d is the vector from the charge's position to the field point, so it's in the direction from charge to r. So the term (v · d) is (v |d| cosθ), where θ is the angle between v and d.

But getting back to the potentials. The scalar potential is usually given by V = ( q/(4 π ε₀) ) * (1/|d| ) * [1/(1 - (v · d̂)/c² ) ].

Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct expressions are:

V(r, t) = [ q/(4 π ε₀) ] * [ 1/( |d| (1 - (v · d̂)/c² )) ]

A(r, t) = [ (μ₀ q v )/(4 π) ] * [ 1/( |d| (1 - (v · d̂)/c² )) ]

But looking at the options, none of them directly match this. Let me see the options again.

Option C: V = ( q c )/(4 π ε₀ (d c - d · v) ), and A = ( μ₀ q c v )/(4 π (d c - d · v) )

So for V, denominator is (d c - d · v ), which is a scalar, as d is a vector and v is a vector. Wait, no, d c is a vector multiplied by scalar c, so it's a vector. Then subtracting the scalar (d · v ), that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, no, I think the denominator in option C is written as (d c - (d · v) ), which would be a vector minus a scalar, which is impossible. So perhaps there's a typo in the way it's written.

Wait, looking again, the option C for V is ( q c )/(4πε₀ (d c - vec{d} · vec{v}) ), and similarly for A. Wait, perhaps it's not a subtraction of a vector and a scalar. It must be a scalar denominator. So perhaps the denominator is (c|d| - (d · v) ), since d · v is a scalar. So option C's denominator is (c |d| - (vec{d} · vec{v}) ), which is a scalar.

So V would be ( q c )/(4 π ε₀ (c |d| - (d · v )) ), and A is ( μ₀ q c v )/(4 π (c |d| - (d · v )) )

Hmm, but why is there a c in the numerator of V? Because in the static case, V is q/(4 π ε₀ |d| ). So including a factor of c in the numerator would change the units. For V, the units should be volts (J/C). Let's see: [q] is C, [c] is m/s, [ε₀] is F/m (C² s^4/(kg m^3)), and denominator is (m - (m·m/s )). Wait, no, denominator is (m (c) - (m· (m/s )) ), which is in meters. So numerator: C * m/s. Denominator: m.

So V's unit is (C m/s )/ m → C/s → which is current. But that can't be right because V should be in volts (J/C). So this must be wrong. So option C can't be correct because the units don't match.

Looking at option D: V is ( q c )/(4 π ε₀ (d c + d · v ) ), and A is ( μ₀ q c v )/(4 π (d c + d · v ) )

Again, denominator is (c |d| + (d ·v )). Let's check the units for V. (C * m/s ) / ( m ) → C/s again. Which is incorrect. So option D also has incorrect units for V.

Hmm, so options C and D have V with units of C/s, which is incorrect. So they are probably wrong.

Going back to options A and B.

Option A: V is q/(4 π ε₀ r ), which is correct for the static case, but in our case, r is |d|, which is correct. A is (v²/c²) V. So A would have units of (m²/s²)/(m²/s²) ) * volts → volts, which is not correct because A is a vector potential, which has units of T·m² (or Wb/m²). Wait, let's see: [V] is volts (J/C). [A] would be [V] * (s²/m²) → (J/C * s²/m² ). Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, let me think in terms of the formulas.

If V is correct as in option B and A, but then A is v/(c²) * V. Let's check units for A in option B.

V has units of volts: J/C.

v has units m/s.

c is m/s. So v/(c²) has units 1/(m/s) ), which is s/m. So (v/(c²)) * V would have units (s/m) * (J/C ), but J is kg m²/s². So (s/m) * (kg m²/(C s² )) ) → kg m / (C s² ). Hmm, not sure if that's correct.

Alternatively, in the case of option B, the vector potential is (v/(c²)) V. So if V is in volts, then A would have units (m/s)/(m²/s²) ) * volts → (s m )/(m²) ) * V → s/(m) * V.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the actual expressions for the potentials.

The scalar potential is given by:

V(r, t) = (1/(4πε₀)) * ∫ (ρ(r', t') ) / |r - r'| dt'

But for a moving point charge, the charge density ρ is a delta function, and the integral simplifies to q/(4 π ε₀ |d| ), where |d| is the distance at the retarded time.

So V is q/(4 π ε₀ |d| ), which is option B's V.

For the vector potential, the expression is:

A(r, t) = (μ₀/(4π)) ∫ ( J(r', t') × (r - r') ) / |r - r'|² dt'

But for a point charge moving with velocity v at time t', the current density J is ρ v, which is (q δ³(r' - s(t')) ) v. So the integral becomes (μ₀ q v)/(4π) ∫ [ (r - s(t')) ) × (1/|r - s(t')|² ) ] dt'

But this integral is evaluated along the path of the charge. For a charge moving at a constant velocity, the integral simplifies. 

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, I think that the vector potential for a charge moving with velocity v is given by:

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q v )/(4π c²) * (1/(1 - (v·d̂)/c² )) ) * (d̂ )

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, for a charge moving with velocity v, the vector potential can be written as:

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q v )/(4π c²) * (1/|d| ) * [ 1/(1 - (v·d̂)/c² ) ] 

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, from the theory, the vector potential due to a charge moving at velocity v is:

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c²) (1/(1 - (v·d̂)/c² )) * (1/|d| )

But I'm not confident about this.

Wait, another approach: the potentials are related by the Lorenz gauge condition. The Lorenz gauge condition is ∇·A + (1/c²) ∂V/∂t = 0. But perhaps that's not directly helpful here.

Alternatively, if I recall, the vector potential A is given by (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c²) (1/(1 - (v·d̂)/c² )) * (d̂ )

Which would make A a vector in the direction of d, scaled by that factor.

But let's look again at the options. Option B says A is (v/c²) V. So let's compute the units. V has units of volts (V), which is J/C. v has units m/s, c^2 is m²/s². So v/c² is (m/s)/(m²/s²) )= s/(m). So (v/c²) V has units (s/m) * (J/C) )= (kg m²/(C s²)) * (s/m) )= kg m/(C s²).

What's the unit for A? The vector potential has units of T·m² (tesla times square meter), and tesla is kg/(s² C), so T·m² is kg m²/(s² C), which matches the units I just found. So the units for option B's A are correct.

So if V is correct as in option B, and A is (v/c²) V, which has correct units, then option B could be correct.

But wait, looking back, in option B, V is q/(4π ε₀ |d| ), and A is (v/(c²)) V. So A would be (v q )/(4 π ε₀ c² |d| ). But the standard expression for A should involve μ₀ instead of ε₀. Because A is related to B, which is μ₀ times something.

Wait, because the expression for the vector potential in terms of current would involve μ₀. Let me think. The vector potential is given by:

A(r, t) = (μ₀/(4π)) ∫ ( J(r', t') × (r - r') ) / |r - r'|² dt'

For a point charge, J is ρ v = q δ³(r' - s(tr)) ) v.

So perhaps the vector potential would involve μ₀. So looking at the options, option B's A is (v/c²) V. V is (1/(4π ε₀)) (q/|d| ), so (v/c²) V would be (v q)/(4 π ε₀ c² |d| ). But the correct expression for A should involve μ₀, not ε₀.

So option B's A would have 1/ε₀, but it should be μ₀. So that's a problem.

Looking back, option C's A is (μ₀ q c v )/(4 π (d c - d · v ) ). Let me compute the units for A in option C.

Numerator: μ₀ has units of H/m (kg m/(s² A²)). q is C, c is m/s, v is m/s. So numerator units: (kg m/(s² A²)) * C * (m/s) * (m/s) → kg m/(s² A²) * C m²/s².

Denominator: (m * c - (m * (m/s)) ) → m^2/s. Wait, not sure. Wait, denominator is (c |d| - (d · v) ), which is a scalar. Let's assume it's in meters, because |d| is m, c is m/s, so c |d| is m*(m/s) → no, wait, no, c is m/s. So c |d| is (m/s)*m → m²/s. And d·v is (m)(m/s) → m²/s. So denominator is (m²/s - m²/s) → m²/s. So denominator is m²/s.

So overall, A's units in option C are [ (kg m/(s² A²)) * C m²/s² ) ] / (m²/s) ) → (kg m/(s² A²) * C m²/s² ) * s/m² → kg C / (s² A²) * m²/(s²) ) * s/m² → Wait, perhaps another approach.

Wait, the denominator in option C is (c |d| - (d · v) ), which is a scalar. Let me not get stuck on units but look for the presence of μ₀.

Option C: A = (μ₀ q c v ) / (4 π (c |d| - (d · v )) )

So if V is (q c)/(4 π ε₀ (c |d| - (d ·v )) ), then A is (μ₀ c v )/(4 π (c |d| -d ·v )) ) * (q)/(4 π ε₀ (c |d| -d ·v )) ) * something? No, I think I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct expressions involve both ε₀ and μ₀, since the potentials are related to the fields, which involve both permittivity and permeability.

Wait, another approach: the potentials satisfy Maxwell's equations. The electric field is E = -∇V - ∂A/∂t.

The magnetic field is B = ∇×A.

But perhaps I should think in terms of the potentials for a moving charge. The scalar potential is V(r,t) = q/(4π ε₀) * 1/(r'), where r' is the distance at the retarded time. The vector potential is A(r,t) = (μ₀ q v)/(4π c²) * 1/(r') * (1/(1 - (v · r̂)/c² )) ), where r̂ is the unit vector in the direction of r'.

So let me write r' as |d|, and the term (v · r̂ ) is v cosθ, where θ is the angle between v and d.

So the denominator would be 1 - (v cosθ)/c.

So the vector potential becomes:

A = (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c²) * (1/|d| ) * (1/(1 - (v cosθ)/c )) )

= (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c² |d| ) * [ 1 / (1 - (v · d̂ )/c ) ]

Which can be written as (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c² |d| ) * 1/(1 - (v · d̂ )/c )

But looking at the options, none of them exactly match this, but perhaps we can manipulate it.

Wait, let me note that 1/(1 - (v · d̂ )/c ) = 1/( (c - v cosθ )/c ) ) = c/(c - v cosθ )

So putting it back into A:

A = (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c² |d| ) * c/(c - (v cosθ ) )

= (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c |d| ) * 1/(c - (v cosθ ) )

But (c - (v cosθ )) is ( c |d| - (v · d ) ) / |d|, since v · d = v |d| cosθ.

So,

A = (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c |d| ) * |d|/( c |d| - (v · d ) )

= (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c ( c |d| - (v · d ) ) )

Which simplifies to:

A = (μ₀ q v c )/(4 π ( c² |d| - c v · d ) )

Wait, no, let me compute that again. Because (c |d| - (v · d )) is the denominator. So:

A = (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c |d| ) * |d|/( c |d| - (v · d ) )

The |d| in the denominator cancels with the |d| in the numerator, so:

A = (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c ) * 1/( c |d| - (v · d ) )

= (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c ( c |d| - (v · d ) ) )

Hmm, that's not matching any of the options.

Wait, looking back at option C: 

A = (μ₀ q c v )/(4 π ( c |d| - (v · d ) ) )

In this case, the denominator is same as what I have. But in option C, it's (μ₀ q c v )/(4 π ( c |d| - (v · d ) ) )

Which would be:

A = (μ₀ q c v )/(4 π ( c |d| - (v · d ) ) )

But according to my derivation, A is (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c ( c |d| - (v · d ) ) ) )

So the numerator in option C is μ₀ q c v, whereas mine is μ₀ q v / c.

So option C has an extra factor of c in the numerator. So that must be incorrect.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in my derivation. Let me go back.

The vector potential is A = (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c²) * [ 1/(1 - (v · r̂ )/c ) ] * (r̂ ) / |d| ?

Wait, no, I think I might have included an incorrect term. Let me consider the integral form of the vector potential. For a charge moving with velocity v, the vector potential at r and t is:

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q)/(4 π c²) * v × (r - s(tr)) / |r - s(tr)|² evaluated at the retarded time.

Wait, that's not quite right. The vector potential formula is:

A(r, t) = (1/(4 π ε₀ c² )) ∫ ( J(r', t') × (r - r') ) / |r - r'| dt'

But J is q δ³(r' - s(tr)) v, so:

A(r, t) = (1/(4 π ε₀ c² )) * [ q v × (r - s(tr)) / |r - s(tr)|² ] evaluated at tr.

Since (r - s(tr)) is d, we have:

A = ( q v × d )/(4 π ε₀ c² |d|² )

But because v × d is a vector, and we need to express A in terms of d and v, which are vectors. Hmm, perhaps I'm not on the right track here.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct expression for the vector potential is:

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c² ) * (1/(1 - (v · d̂ )/c )) * d̂ / |d|

Which would be:

A = (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c² ) * (1/(1 - (v · d̂ )/c )) * (d/|d| )

= (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c² ) * (d / |d| ) * (1/(1 - (v · d̂ )/c ) )

But I'm not sure how this relates to the options given. Let me see what option C says.

Option C: A = ( μ₀ q c v )/(4 π (d c - (d · v )) )

= (μ₀ q c v )/(4 π (c |d| - (d · v )) )

Wait, if I factor out |d| from the denominator, it becomes:

A = ( μ₀ q c v )/(4 π |d| ( c - (d · v ) / |d| ) )

But (d · v ) / |d| is v cosθ, so:

A = ( μ₀ q c v )/(4 π |d| ( c - v cosθ ) )

Which can be written as:

A = ( μ₀ q c v )/(4 π |d| (c - (v · d̂ ) c ) )

Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should give up and realize that the correct option is B, because A is expressed as (v/c²) V, which has the correct units and incorporates the velocity.

Wait, but earlier I noted that option B's expression for A has 1/ε₀, whereas it should have μ₀. So perhaps option B is incorrect.

Hmmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let me think about the potentials when the charge is stationary. If the charge is stationary, then v=0, so A should be zero. So looking at the options:

Option A: A = v²/c² V → when v=0, A=0. Correct.

Option B: A = v/c² V → when v=0, A=0. Correct.

Option C: A = (μ₀ q c v )/(4 π (c |d| - (d ·v )) ) → v=0 → A=0. Correct.

Option D: same as C, but denominator is + instead of -, but when v=0, A=0. So all options A-D have A=0 when v=0, which is correct.

So that doesn't help eliminate any options.

What about when the charge moves with speed v much less than c? Then we can use a non-relativistic approximation. So let's make the approximation that v << c.

In this case, the denominator (c |d| - (d ·v )) ≈ c |d| (1 - (v · d̂ )/c )

Because (d ·v ) = v |d| cosθ = v c |d| cosθ, assuming c is a constant. Wait, no, |d| is a fixed distance. So (d · v ) = v |d| cosθ.

So denominator is c |d| (1 - (v cosθ )/(c) )

So, in the non-relativistic limit, the potentials would be approximated as:

V ≈ q/(4 π ε₀ |d| ) * [1 + (v cosθ )/(c²) ]

A ≈ (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c² |d| ) * [1 + (v cosθ )/(c²) ]

But looking at the options, when v<<c, how do they behave?

Option B: V is q/(4 π ε₀ |d| ), A is (v/c²) V → A ≈ (v q )/(4 π ε₀ c² |d| )

But in the non-relativistic limit, the vector potential A should have a term proportional to v/(c²) times something, so this seems consistent. Wait, but earlier I thought option B's A has ε₀ where it should have μ₀. But perhaps in the non-relativistic limit, some terms can be approximated using ε₀ and μ₀.

Wait, but in the non-relativistic case, the vector potential is usually:

A = (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c² |d| )

Which is option B's A only if μ₀/(4 π c² ) is equal to 1/(4 π ε₀ c² ), which would require μ₀ = 1/ε₀, but μ₀ ε₀ = 1/c². So unless μ₀ =1/(ε₀ c² ), which is not the case, these can't be equal. So option B's A can't be correct because it has 1/ε₀ instead of μ₀.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. I think I'm stuck, but I'll make a educated guess. The correct answer is option C, because it includes both ε₀ and μ₀ correctly, and the denominator is structured correctly with (c |d| - (d · v )). The vector potential in option C has the correct dependence on μ₀ and q, and the numerator has v, which makes sense because the vector potential depends on the charge's velocity.

Wait, but earlier when I checked the units for option C, V had incorrect units. So I'm confused. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit analysis.

Wait, let's recheck option C's V:

V = ( q c )/(4 π ε₀ (c |d| - (d · v )) )

Units: q is C, c is m/s. ε₀ has units F/m = C² s⁴/(kg m³). So denominator is (m/s * m) - (m²/s ), which is m²/s - m²/s → denominator is in m²/s.

So numerator: C * m/s.

Denominator: m²/s.

So overall, V has units (C m/s )/( m²/s ) ) → C/(m ). But the unit for V should be volts (J/C = kg m²/(C s²) ). So C/(m) is not matching. So option C's V has incorrect units. So option C can't be correct.

Hmm. So I'm really stuck. Let me think about the standard expressions.

The usual expressions for the potentials of a moving charge:

The scalar potential is:

V(r, t) = (q / (4 π ε₀ )) * [ 1 / |r - r_tr| ] * [ 1 / (1 - (v · r̂ )/c² ) ]

Wait, no, actually, the scalar potential for a moving charge is given by (using the Lienard potential expressions):

V(r, t) = (q/(4 π ε₀ )) * [ 1/( |d| ) ] * [ 1/(1 - (v · d̂ )/c ) ]

Wait, but this doesn't seem right either because the denominator would then have units of velocity. I'm getting confused again.

Alternatively, the correct expression for V is:

V(r, t) = (q/(4 π ε₀ |d| )) * [ 1/(1 - (v · d̂ )/c² ) ]

And for A:

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c² |d| ) * [ 1/(1 - (v · d̂ )/c² ) ]

So combining, V and A share the same factor [1/(1 - (v · d̂ )/c² ) ].

Looking at the options, none of them exactly match this. But perhaps when we factor in the denominator, which is (c |d| - (d · v ) ), we can write:

[1/(1 - (v · d̂ )/c² ) ] = [ c² ] / [ c² - (v · d̂ ) |d| ]

= c² / ( c |d| - (d · v ) )

Because (v · d̂ ) |d| = (v · d )

So, putting it into V:

V = ( q/(4 π ε₀ |d| ) ) * [ c²/( c |d| - (d · v ) ) ]

= ( q c² )/(4 π ε₀ ( c |d| - (d · v ) ) |d| )

Wait, but that's getting complicated, and none of the options have this form.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but the options for V in C and D are:

C: V = (q c )/(4 π ε₀ (c |d| - (d · v )) )

D: V = (q c )/(4 π ε₀ (c |d| + (d · v )) )

But from the Lienard expressions, the scalar potential V has a denominator that includes (c² - v² ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option B, because A is expressed as (v/c²) V, which makes sense dimensionally, and V is correct as the static potential.

But earlier I thought that option B's A has 1/ε₀ instead of μ₀, which is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the vector potential is expressed via ε₀ as well, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the vector potential is related to the magnetic field. The magnetic field B is given by B = ∇ × A. For a moving charge, B is (μ₀ q (v × r̂ ) )/(4 π c² |r|² ) (1/(1 - (v · r̂ )/c² ) )

So, to get B, you need A to have terms with μ₀ and v.

Looking at option C's A, it's ( μ₀ q c v )/(4 π (c |d| - (d · v )) )

If I write A as ( μ₀ q v )/(4 π c (c |d| - (d ·v )) ), that would make sense, as it would factor in the c correctly.

But option C has an extra c in the numerator, so it can't be the right expression.

Hmm, this is taking way too long, and I'm not making progress. I'll have to make an educated guess.

Based on the earlier analysis, option C's V has incorrect units, so it's probably wrong. Option B's A has the correct form (v/c²) V, but the wrong constants (using ε₀ instead of μ₀). But none of the options have both correct ε₀ and μ₀ in their expressions.

Wait, another approach: the Maxwell equations. The scalar potential satisfies ∇² V = - (ρ/ε₀ ), and the vector potential satisfies ∇² A = -μ₀ J. So, given that J for a moving charge is q v δ³(r - s(t)), the potentials would incorporate these constants.

But I'm not sure how that helps now.

I think I've exhausted my options and need to choose the best possible answer. Based on process of elimination, I'll go with option C because it includes both ε₀ and μ₀ correctly, and the denominator seems to align with the retarded time expression.


The problem involves determining the scalar potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) and vector potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \) for a moving point charge \( q \) at a field point \( \vec{r} \) at time \( t \), where \( t > t_r \) (with \( t_r \) being the retarded time). The vector \( \vec{d} \) represents the displacement from the charge's position at \( t_r \) to the observation point \( \vec{r} \), and \( \vec{v} \) is the velocity of the charge at \( t_r \). The goal is to identify the correct expressions for \( V \) and \( \vec{A} \) from the given options.

### Key Analysis of the Potentials

1. **Scalar Potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - The scalar potential is generally derived from the electric field and is influenced by the retarded time due to the motion of the charge. For a static charge, \( V \) is given by \( V = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 |\vec{d}|} \), where \( |\vec{d}| \) is the distance between the charge and the observation point at \( t_r \). When the charge is moving, relativistic corrections may arise, but the denominator often involves terms like \( c|\vec{d}| - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \), where \( c \) is the speed of light.
   - Option A and B suggest \( V = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 |\vec{d}|} \), which is correct for the static case but does not account for relativistic corrections. Options C and D include the term \( c|\vec{d}| - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) in the denominator, which is consistent with relativistic effects.

2. **Vector Potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - The vector potential is derived from the magnetic field and depends on the velocity \( \vec{v} \) of the charge. It typically involves \( \mu_0 \), the permeability of free space, and is proportional to \( \vec{v} \). The denominator often matches the structure of the scalar potential, incorporating terms like \( c|\vec{d}| - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \).
   - Option A suggests \( \vec{A} = \frac{\vec{v}^2}{c^2} V \), which is dimensionally inconsistent because \( \vec{A} \) is a vector and \( \vec{v}^2 \) is a scalar. Option B suggests \( \vec{A} = \frac{\vec{v}}{c^2} V \), which has the correct units but lacks the proper inclusion of \( \mu_0 \). Options C and D include \( \mu_0 \) and have the correct structure for \( \vec{A} \), but their expressions for \( V \) were found to have incorrect units.

3. **Critical Evaluation of Options:**
   - **Option A:** Incorrect because \( \vec{A} = \frac{\vec{v}^2}{c^2} V \) is dimensionally inconsistent.
   - **Option B:** While \( V \) is correct for the static case, \( \vec{A} = \frac{\vec{v}}{c^2} V \) does not include \( \mu_0 \), which is necessary for the vector potential.
   - **Option C:** \( V \) was found to have incorrect units, as the numerator \( qc \) introduces a factor that does not align with the standard units for potential. However, \( \vec{A} \) includes \( \mu_0 \) and has the correct structure.
   - **Option D:** Similar to Option C, but the denominator \( c|\vec{d}| + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) is inconsistent with the expected form for relativistic corrections.

### Conclusion
After evaluating the options, Option C is selected as the best choice. While its expression for \( V \) has questionable units, it correctly incorporates \( \mu_0 \) in \( \vec{A} \) and aligns with the expected structure of the potentials for a moving charge.

**Answer: C**
