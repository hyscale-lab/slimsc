Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step. 

Alright, the problem says we dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is about the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Oh, and the Ka of acetic acid is given as 1.85x10^-5. The options are A to D.

Wait, first, I remember that when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes. So the initial step is to find the concentration after dilution. Then, when we start titrating, figuring out how much NaOH is added at 25% of the equivalence point is the next step. And at equivalence, we'll have a buffer solution to handle.

Let me start with the first part: the initial dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then, adding 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³, which is 0.04 liters.

The moles of acetic acid before dilution would be Molarity × Volume. So 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After dilution, the volume is 0.04 L, so the new concentration is moles / volume, which is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Oh wait, because when you double the volume, concentration halves. So 0.05 to 0.025 M. Got it.

Now, when titrating this with NaOH, the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. So each mole of acetic acid reacts with a mole of NaOH.

The equivalence point is when all the acetic acid has been neutralized. So first, let's find the volume of NaOH needed at equivalence.

Moles of acetic acid: 0.001 mol. Since the NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed would be moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH. 

The question asks about 25% titration. So that would be 25% of 10 cm³, which is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, 0.25 × 0.001 mol = 0.00025 mol of NaOH has been added. Because 2.5 cm³ is 0.0025 L, and 0.1 M × 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

Wait, but wait, when we add NaOH, it's reacting with acetic acid. So, the moles of acetic acid will decrease, and the moles of acetate will increase.

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So, initial moles of acetic acid: 0.001 mol. So 25% of that is 0.00025 mol. So moles of acetic acid remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Moles of acetate formed: 0.00025 mol.

But wait, the total volume at this point is the initial solution (40 cm³) plus the 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. So 42.5 cm³, which is 0.0425 L.

So, the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

Then, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])

pKa is -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa ≈ 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647). Let's compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. Log(0.3333) is about -0.477. So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256. Hmm, so around 4.26. 

Looking at the options, option A says 4.26 and 8.52 for the first and second values, respectively. But wait, what about the equivalence point?

At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to form acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so it will hydrolyze in water to form a basic solution.

The concentration of acetate ions needs to be found. At equivalence, all 0.001 mol of acetic acid is converted to acetate. The total volume is initial 40 cm³ plus 10 cm³ of NaOH, so 50 cm³ or 0.05 L.

So [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The pH of a solution of acetate can be found using the Kb expression. Since Kw = Ka × Kb, Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

The hydrolysis reaction is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the concentration of OH^- produced, the expression becomes:

5.405e-10 = (x^2) / (0.02 - x)

Since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11. So x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5. pH is 14 - pOH. pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH ≈ 14 -4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, but none of the options have 9.02 as the equivalence point. Let me check the options again.

Option A: 4.26; 8.52 → No, equivalence is 8.52, which is lower than what I have.

Option D: 4.57; 6.92 → No.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. Did I calculate correctly?

Wait, wait. At equivalence, the solution is sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and strong base. So the solution is basic, so I should expect a pH higher than 7. But in the options, only option A has a higher pH (8.52), but I calculated around 9.02, so that's not matching.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the Kb.

Ka of acetic acid is 1.85e-5. So Kb is 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10? Wait, 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 equals approximately 5.4e-10. Yes.

Concentration of acetate is 0.02 M.

So Kb = 5.405e-10. Setting up the equation:

x^2 / 0.02 = 5.405e-10

x^2 = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ 1.04e-5 M OH-.

So pH is 14 - (pOH) = 14 - (log(1.04e-5)).

Log(1.04e-5) is log(1.04) + log(1e-5) ≈ 0.017 + (-5) → -4.983.

So pOH ≈4.983 → pH ≈14-4.983=9.017. So around 9.02. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculations. Let me double-check the equivalence point.

Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001 mol. So when titrated with 0.1 M NaOH, the volume needed is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L =10 cm³. So total volume is 40 +10 =50 cm³. So [acetate] is 0.001/0.05 =0.02 M.

Hmm, that's correct. So why is the option not matching? Let me check the options again.

Wait, option D says equivalence pH is 6.92. That's acidic, which can't be right. Option A's equivalence is 8.52, which is lower than my calculation. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in another part. Let me think again about the equivalence point. Wait, maybe I forgot that sodium acetate will produce OH- ions, but perhaps the initial concentration is correct.

Wait, wait another thought. Wait, when you dilute the solution, perhaps the initial concentration is wrong. Let me recheck that.

Original solution: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Moles: 0.05 * 0.02 =0.001 mol. Then, adding 20 cm³ of water → total volume 40 cm³. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 =0.025 M. That's correct.

At equivalence, all 0.001 mol becomes acetate. So [acetate] is 0.001 / (40 +10) cm³ (wait, no: 40 is the diluted solution's volume, adding 10 cm³ NaOH, so 50 cm³ total). So 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. So that's correct.

Hmm. So I think my initial calculation is correct, but none of the options have a pH of around 9 at equivalence. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the solution at equivalence isn't just sodium acetate. Wait, because when you titrate a weak acid with a strong base, the equivalence solution is the conjugate base, which is correct. So I think that part is right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the Kb or the pH. Let me recalculate the pH at equivalence.

Kb = 5.405e-10.

The equation is Kb = x^2 / (0.02 - x) → x^2 = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 → x^2=1.081e-11 → x=1.04e-5.

So [OH^-] =1.04e-5 → pOH= log(1/(1.04e-5))= log(9.615e4)= approximately 4.982. So pH=14-4.982=9.018.

So that's about 9.02. But none of the options have that. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the initial dilution is wrong. Wait, wait a second. When I diluted 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water, the total is 40 cm³. So the concentration is 0.05 * (20/40) )= 0.025 M. Correct. So that part is right.

Hmm, maybe I messed up the equivalence point. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the pH at 25% of the equivalence volume, not 25% of the total titration. Wait, no, the question says 25% titration, which would be 2.5 cm³, as I thought.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the Henderson-Hasselbalch calculation. Let me recheck that.

At 25% titration, moles of acetic acid remaining: 0.00075 mol. Moles of acetate: 0.00025 mol. The ratio [A-]/[HA] is 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3 ≈0.333.

pH = pKa + log(1/3) → pKa is 4.733, log(1/3)= -0.477 → pH=4.733 -0.477≈4.256→4.26. That's correct.

So at 25% titration, pH is about 4.26. Now, looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value. But for equivalence point, I thought it should be around 9, but option A's equivalence is 8.52.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Let me recalculate Kb.

Ka=1.85e-5 → Kw=1e-14 → Kb=1e-14 /1.85e-5 ≈5.405e-10. Correct.

Wait, maybe I should not have used the approximation. Let me try solving the exact quadratic equation.

The Kb equation: x^2/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Assume x is small compared to 0.02, which it should be, but let's check.

If x^2=5.405e-10 * (0.02 -x) → x^2 = 1.081e-11 -5.405e-10 x.

Rearranging: x^2 +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11 =0.

Using quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a)

Here, a=1; b=5.405e-10; c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant D= (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*(1.081e-11) → which is approx 2.92e-19 +4.324e-11 → 4.324e-11 is larger, so 4.324e-11.

sqrt(D)= sqrt(4.324e-11)= approx 6.576e-6.

So x= [ -5.405e-10 ± 6.576e-6 ] / 2.

We take the positive root.

So numerator is about 6.576e-6 -5.405e-10 ≈6.576e-6.

So x≈6.576e-6 / 2= 3.288e-6.

Wait, that's different from the approximation of 1.04e-5. Hmmm. Oh wait, I think I made a mistake in calculations here. Let me recalculate the quadratic solution correctly.

Wait, the equation is x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant D= b² -4ac → (5.405e-10)^2 -4*(1)*(-1.081e-11) → 2.92e-19 +4.324e-11 → approximately 4.324e-11.

sqrt(D)= sqrt(4.324e-11)= approximately 6.576e-6.

So x = [-5.405e-10 ±6.576e-6 ]/(2*1).

We take the positive root: (−5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ) /2.

Which is approx (6.576e-6 - 5.405e-10)/2 ≈6.576e-6/2=3.288e-6.

So [OH^-]≈3.288e-6 → pOH= -log(3.288e-6) → log(3.288)=0.517 → pOH=5.483 → pH=14-5.483=8.517. So approximately 8.52.

Oh! So I made a mistake earlier by not considering the exact quadratic solution. So the pH at equivalence is about 8.52. Which matches option A's second value. So option A has 4.26 and 8.52 as the two pH values.

So the correct answer would be option A. 4.26 and 8.52.

Wait, but earlier when I assumed x was 1.04e-5, I got pH≈9.02, but using the quadratic, I get pH≈8.52. So I think I should have used the quadratic approach because the approximation might not hold as well as I thought.

So, putting it all together, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and at equivalence, it's approximately 8.52. So the correct option is A.

To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After dilution with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration of acetic acid is:

\[
\text{Concentration after dilution} = \frac{\text{Moles of acetic acid}}{\text{Total volume}} = \frac{0.001}{0.04} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### At 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. Since the initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol, 25% of this is:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid reacted} = 0.25 \times 0.001 = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The remaining moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of acetate ion formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetate ion} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume at this point is the initial solution volume (40.00 cm³) plus the volume of NaOH added (2.50 cm³), giving:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 42.50 \, \text{cm³} = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} \right),
\]

where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733\). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log \left( \frac{0.00588}{0.01765} \right).
\]

The ratio \(\frac{0.00588}{0.01765} \approx 0.333\), and \(\log(0.333) \approx -0.477\). Thus:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 - 0.477 \approx 4.256 \, \text{(rounded to 4.26)}.
\]

### At Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming acetate ions. The moles of acetate ion are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetate ion} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume at equivalence is the initial solution volume (40.00 cm³) plus the volume of NaOH added (10.00 cm³), giving:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 50.00 \, \text{cm³} = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ion is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The solution of acetate ion is basic due to hydrolysis. The hydrolysis reaction is:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The \(K_b\) for acetate is calculated using \(K_w = K_a \cdot K_b\):

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the expression for \(K_b\):

\[
K_b = \frac{[\text{OH}^-]^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}.
\]

Substituting \(K_b\) and \([\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = 0.02 \, \text{M}\):

\[
[\text{OH}^-]^2 = K_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = (5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02 = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
[\text{OH}^-] = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.983.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 4.983 \approx 9.017.
\]

However, using the quadratic solution for \(K_b\), the pH is recalculated to be approximately 8.52. This matches the equivalence point value in option A.

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52. 

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step. 

Alright, the problem says we dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is about the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Oh, and the Ka of acetic acid is given as 1.85x10^-5. The options are A to D.

Wait, first, I remember that when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes. So the initial step is to find the concentration after dilution. Then, when we start titrating, figuring out how much NaOH is added at 25% of the equivalence point is the next step. And at equivalence, we'll have a buffer solution to handle.

Let me start with the first part: the initial dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then, adding 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³, which is 0.04 liters.

The moles of acetic acid before dilution would be Molarity × Volume. So 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After dilution, the volume is 0.04 L, so the new concentration is moles / volume, which is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Oh wait, because when you double the volume, concentration halves. So 0.05 to 0.025 M. Got it.

Now, when titrating this with NaOH, the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. So each mole of acetic acid reacts with a mole of NaOH.

The equivalence point is when all the acetic acid has been neutralized. So first, let's find the volume of NaOH needed at equivalence.

Moles of acetic acid: 0.001 mol. Since the NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed would be moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH. 

The question asks about 25% titration. So that would be 25% of 10 cm³, which is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, 0.25 × 0.001 mol = 0.00025 mol of NaOH has been added. Because 2.5 cm³ is 0.0025 L, and 0.1 M × 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

Wait, but wait, when we add NaOH, it's reacting with acetic acid. So, the moles of acetic acid will decrease, and the moles of acetate will increase.

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So, initial moles of acetic acid: 0.001 mol. So 25% of that is 0.00025 mol. So moles of acetic acid remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Moles of acetate formed: 0.00025 mol.

But wait, the total volume at this point is the initial solution (40 cm³) plus the 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. So 42.5 cm³, which is 0.0425 L.

So, the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

Then, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])

pKa is -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa ≈ 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647). Let's compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. Log(0.3333) is about -0.477. So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256. Hmm, so around 4.26. 

Looking at the options, option A says 4.26 and 8.52 for the first and second values, respectively. But wait, what about the equivalence point?

At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to form acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so it will hydrolyze in water to form a basic solution.

The concentration of acetate ions needs to be found. At equivalence, all 0.001 mol of acetic acid is converted to acetate. The total volume is initial 40 cm³ plus 10 cm³ of NaOH, so 50 cm³ or 0.05 L.

So [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The pH of a solution of acetate can be found using the Kb expression. Since Kw = Ka × Kb, Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

The hydrolysis reaction is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the concentration of OH^- produced, the expression becomes:

5.405e-10 = (x^2) / (0.02 - x)

Since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11. So x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5. pH is 14 - pOH. pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH ≈ 14 -4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, but none of the options have 9.02 as the equivalence point. Let me check the options again.

Option A: 4.26; 8.52 → No, equivalence is 8.52, which is lower than what I have.

Option D: 4.57; 6.92 → No.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. Did I calculate correctly?

Wait, wait. At equivalence, the solution is sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and strong base. So the solution is basic, so I should expect a pH higher than 7. But in the options, only option A has a higher pH (8.52), but I calculated around 9.02, so that's not matching.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the Kb.

Ka of acetic acid is 1.85e-5. So Kb is 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10? Wait, 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 equals approximately 5.4e-10. Yes.

Concentration of acetate is 0.02 M.

So Kb = 5.405e-10. Setting up the equation:

x^2 / 0.02 = 5.405e-10

x^2 = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ 1.04e-5 M OH-.

So pH is 14 - (pOH) = 14 - (log(1.04e-5)).

Log(1.04e-5) is log(1.04) + log(1e-5) ≈ 0.017 + (-5) → -4.983.

So pOH ≈4.983 → pH ≈14-4.983=9.017. So around 9.02. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculations. Let me double-check the equivalence point.

Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001 mol. So when titrated with 0.1 M NaOH, the volume needed is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L =10 cm³. So total volume is 40 +10 =50 cm³. So [acetate] is 0.001/0.05 =0.02 M.

Hmm, that's correct. So why is the option not matching? Let me check the options again.

Wait, option D says equivalence pH is 6.92. That's acidic, which can't be right. Option A's equivalence is 8.52, which is lower than my calculation. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in another part. Let me think again about the equivalence point. Wait, maybe I forgot that sodium acetate will produce OH- ions, but perhaps the initial concentration is correct.

Wait, wait another thought. Wait, when you dilute the solution, perhaps the initial concentration is wrong. Let me recheck that.

Original solution: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Moles: 0.05 * 0.02 =0.001 mol. Then, adding 20 cm³ of water → total volume 40 cm³. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 =0.025 M. That's correct.

At equivalence, all 0.001 mol becomes acetate. So [acetate] is 0.001 / (40 +10) cm³ (wait, no: 40 is the diluted solution's volume, adding 10 cm³ NaOH, so 50 cm³ total). So 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. So that's correct.

Hmm. So I think my initial calculation is correct, but none of the options have a pH of around 9 at equivalence. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the solution at equivalence isn't just sodium acetate. Wait, because when you titrate a weak acid with a strong base, the equivalence solution is the conjugate base, which is correct. So I think that part is right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the Kb or the pH. Let me recalculate the pH at equivalence.

Kb = 5.405e-10.

The equation is Kb = x^2 / (0.02 - x) → x^2 = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 → x^2=1.081e-11 → x=1.04e-5.

So [OH^-] =1.04e-5 → pOH= log(1/(1.04e-5))= log(9.615e4)= approximately 4.982. So pH=14-4.982=9.018.

So that's about 9.02. But none of the options have that. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the initial dilution is wrong. Wait, wait a second. When I diluted 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water, the total is 40 cm³. So the concentration is 0.05 * (20/40) )= 0.025 M. Correct. So that part is right.

Hmm, maybe I messed up the equivalence point. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the pH at 25% of the equivalence volume, not 25% of the total titration. Wait, no, the question says 25% titration, which would be 2.5 cm³, as I thought.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the Henderson-Hasselbalch calculation. Let me recheck that.

At 25% titration, moles of acetic acid remaining: 0.00075 mol. Moles of acetate: 0.00025 mol. The ratio [A-]/[HA] is 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3 ≈0.333.

pH = pKa + log(1/3) → pKa is 4.733, log(1/3)= -0.477 → pH=4.733 -0.477≈4.256→4.26. That's correct.

So at 25% titration, pH is about 4.26. Now, looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value. But for equivalence point, I thought it should be around 9, but option A's equivalence is 8.52.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Let me recalculate Kb.

Ka=1.85e-5 → Kw=1e-14 → Kb=1e-14 /1.85e-5 ≈5.405e-10. Correct.

Wait, maybe I should not have used the approximation. Let me try solving the exact quadratic equation.

The Kb equation: x^2/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Assume x is small compared to 0.02, which it should be, but let's check.

If x^2=5.405e-10 * (0.02 -x) → x^2 = 1.081e-11 -5.405e-10 x.

Rearranging: x^2 +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11 =0.

Using quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a)

Here, a=1; b=5.405e-10; c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant D= (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*(1.081e-11) → which is approx 2.92e-19 +4.324e-11 → 4.324e-11 is larger, so 4.324e-11.

sqrt(D)= sqrt(4.324e-11)= approx 6.576e-6.

So x= [ -5.405e-10 ± 6.576e-6 ] / 2.

We take the positive root.

So numerator is about 6.576e-6 -5.405e-10 ≈6.576e-6.

So x≈6.576e-6 / 2= 3.288e-6.

Wait, that's different from the approximation of 1.04e-5. Hmmm. Oh wait, I think I made a mistake in calculations here. Let me recalculate the quadratic solution correctly.

Wait, the equation is x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant D= b² -4ac → (5.405e-10)^2 -4*(1)*(-1.081e-11) → 2.92e-19 +4.324e-11 → approximately 4.324e-11.

sqrt(D)= sqrt(4.324e-11)= approximately 6.576e-6.

So x = [-5.405e-10 ±6.576e-6 ]/(2*1).

We take the positive root: (−5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ) /2.

Which is approx (6.576e-6 - 5.405e-10)/2 ≈6.576e-6/2=3.288e-6.

So [OH^-]≈3.288e-6 → pOH= -log(3.288e-6) → log(3.288)=0.517 → pOH=5.483 → pH=14-5.483=8.517. So approximately 8.52.

Oh! So I made a mistake earlier by not considering the exact quadratic solution. So the pH at equivalence is about 8.52. Which matches option A's second value. So option A has 4.26 and 8.52 as the two pH values.

So the correct answer would be option A. 4.26 and 8.52.

Wait, but earlier when I assumed x was 1.04e-5, I got pH≈9.02, but using the quadratic, I get pH≈8.52. So I think I should have used the quadratic approach because the approximation might not hold as well as I thought.

So, putting it all together, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and at equivalence, it's approximately 8.52. So the correct option is A.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After dilution with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration of acetic acid is:

\[
\text{Concentration after dilution} = \frac{\text{Moles of acetic acid}}{\text{Total volume}} = \frac{0.001}{0.04} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### At 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. Since the initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol, 25% of this is:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid reacted} = 0.25 \times 0.001 = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The remaining moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of acetate ion formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetate ion} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume at this point is the initial solution volume (40.00 cm³) plus the volume of NaOH added (2.50 cm³), giving:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 42.50 \, \text{cm³} = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} \right),
\]

where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733\). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log \left( \frac{0.00588}{0.01765} \right).
\]

The ratio \(\frac{0.00588}{0.01765} \approx 0.333\), and \(\log(0.333) \approx -0.477\). Thus:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 - 0.477 \approx 4.256 \, \text{(rounded to 4.26)}.
\]

### At Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming acetate ions. The moles of acetate ion are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetate ion} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume at equivalence is the initial solution volume (40.00 cm³) plus the volume of NaOH added (10.00 cm³), giving:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 50.00 \, \text{cm³} = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ion is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The solution of acetate ion is basic due to hydrolysis. The hydrolysis reaction is:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The \(K_b\) for acetate is calculated using \(K_w = K_a \cdot K_b\):

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the expression for \(K_b\):

\[
K_b = \frac{[\text{OH}^-]^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}.
\]

Substituting \(K_b\) and \([\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = 0.02 \, \text{M}\):

\[
[\text{OH}^-]^2 = K_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = (5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02 = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
[\text{OH}^-] = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.983.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 4.983 \approx 9.017.
\]

However, using the quadratic solution for \(K_b\), the pH is recalculated to be approximately 8.52. This matches the equivalence point value in option A.

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52.
