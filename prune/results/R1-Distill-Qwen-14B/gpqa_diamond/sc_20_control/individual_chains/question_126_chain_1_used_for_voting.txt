Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I hope I can figure it out.

The question involves two reactions and then analyzing the products using HPLC. Let me see what each reaction does.

First, Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH (lithium aluminum hydride) followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent, right? It usually reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So, hexan-3-one has a ketone group at position 3. When that's reduced, it becomes a secondary alcohol at position 3. So, the structure after reduction would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, but the starting material is (S) configuration. Does the reduction change the configuration? Hmm, LAH is used for ketone reductions, and I think ketone reduction typically doesn't change the configuration because the carbonyl group is planar. So the alcohol would retain the same configuration as the starting material. So the product from Reaction I is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Then, Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by an acidic workup. Pentane-2,4-dione is a diketone, meaning it has two ketone groups. NaBH4 is a reducing agent, but I'm not sure if it's strong enough for diketones. Wait, LAH is stronger, but NaBH4 can also reduce ketones. So each ketone would be reduced. So, the structure is (CH3)COCH2COCH2CH3. Wait, no, pentane-2,4-dione would be O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3, but wait, pentane has five carbons. So maybe it's O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3? No, wait, let's count. Pentane-2,4-dione would have the structure (CH3)C(O)CH2C(O)CH3? No, wait, no. Let me think again. The formula would be O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-. Wait, no, pentane-2,4-dione is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3? Maybe I'm getting that wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3? No, I'm getting confused. Wait, pentane is five carbons. So positions 2 and 4 are the ketone groups. So the structure is:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. So pentane-2,4-dione is (CH3)2CO–CH2–(CH3)2CO? No, wait, no, that can't be right. Or wait, it's CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. So two ketone groups on the second and fourth carbons of a five-carbon chain.

When NaBH4 is used to reduce this, each ketone will be reduced to an alcohol. So each ketone becomes a secondary alcohol. So the product would be HO-CH2-C(OH)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Let me think again. Each ketone (C=O) becomes C-OH. So the structure becomes CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. So that's 2,4-pentanediol. Wait, but wait, that would be two secondary alcohols on the same carbon chain. So the product is 2,4-pentanediol.

Wait, but NaBH4 can't reduce adjacent ketones? Or can it? Because in some cases, if multiple ketones are present, each is reduced. So I think it does get reduced. So the product is 2,4-pentanediol, which is a vicinal diol, but wait, no, because the two OHs are on carbons 2 and 4, which are separated by a CH2 group. So it's not vicinal. So each OH is on its own carbon, not adjacent.

So, after both reactions, the products are from Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, and from Reaction II: 2,4-pentanediol.

Wait, but Reaction II uses excess NaBH4. Does that affect anything? Probably not in this case, as the two ketones are both reduced, so the diol is formed.

Now, the products are combined and run on HPLC columns. There are two columns: normal-phase and a chiral one. The question is how many peaks will be observed in each.

First, let's think about the products.

Reaction I produces (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. That's a single enantiomer because the starting material was (S) configuration and the reduction didn't change the configuration. So this product is a single compound.

Reaction II produces 2,4-pentanediol. Wait, is this a meso compound? Let me think. The structure is HO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, earlier structure was CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. So the molecule is symmetric. Let me draw it: CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. So the central carbon is CH2, with two CH(OH) groups on each side. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me write the structure correctly. The molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. So the two OHs are on carbons 2 and 4. The molecule is symmetric because if you mirror it across the center, it looks the same. So this is a meso compound. Meso compounds have multiple stereocenters but are achiral because of a plane of symmetry. So 2,4-pentanediol is a meso compound, which means it's a single compound, not a mixture of enantiomers.

Wait, but when you reduce a diketone, could you get more than one product? Or does the NaBH4 reduce both ketones in such a way that you get a single product? Let me think. The starting material is a diketone. When you reduce both ketones, since the molecule is symmetric, the product will have two OH groups, but due to the symmetry, it's a meso compound. So only one product comes from Reaction II.

So combining the products of Reaction I and II, we have two compounds: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and 2,4-pentanediol (meso).

But wait, wait. Let's confirm that.

Reaction I produces one compound: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Reaction II produces 2,4-pentanediol, which is a meso compound, so it's a single compound.

So the combined products are two compounds. But wait, let me think about the possibility of any other products. For example, could the product from Reaction I undergo any other reaction? No, because after the acidic workup, it's just the alcohol.

So, when both products are combined, there are two compounds: one is a single enantiomer, and the other is a meso compound (which is achiral).

Now, when these are run on HPLC columns.

First, normal-phase HPLC. Normal-phase is where the stationary phase is polar (like silica) and the mobile phase is non-polar. The separation is based on the polarity of the compounds. The more polar, the more they elute later.

But the key factor here is whether the compounds are the same in terms of their structure for the HPLC.

Wait, but more importantly, when run on a normal-phase column, the number of peaks depends on the number of different compounds. Since there are two different compounds (the hexan-3-ol and pentanediol), how many peaks would that give? Let me think. Each distinct compound would give a peak, unless their retention times are the same. But in this case, the two compounds are different in structure, so they should elute at different times, leading to two peaks.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Are there any stereoisomers in the products that would cause more peaks?

Looking back: Reaction I gives (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. That's a single enantiomer. Reaction II gives 2,4-pentanediol, which is a meso compound, so it's a single compound, and achiral. So when combining both, we have two separate compounds. So on a normal-phase HPLC (which doesn't distinguish between enantiomers), each would be a single peak. So in normal-phase, two peaks.

Wait, but wait. Wait, no. Wait, the normal-phase HPLC is not necessarily separating based on chirality, but just the physical properties (like polarity, size, etc.). So each distinct compound would give a separate peak. So in this case, two compounds, so two peaks in normal-phase.

But wait, let me think again. The first product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. It has a specific structure. The second is 2,4-pentanediol. Are there any other stereoisomers? Let me think. For Reaction I, is there any possibility of another product? No, because the starting material was a single enantiomer, and the reduction didn't create any new stereocenters. So that's one product.

Reaction II: the product is a meso compound, so it's a single product. So two products in total.

So normal-phase HPLC would show two peaks. So the normal-phase would have two peaks.

Now, the other HPLC is a chiral stationary phase. In this case, the column is chiral, so it can separate enantiomers. So how many peaks would we see?

Let's look at each product:

1. (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol: this is a single enantiomer. When run on a chiral column, it would elute as a single peak because it's not a mixture of enantiomers. It's only one enantiomer.

2. 2,4-pentanediol: this is a meso compound, which is achiral. On a chiral column, achiral compounds typically don't separate into enantiomers because there's no chiral centers to resolve. So the meso compound would elute as a single peak.

So on a chiral column, each of these two compounds (both being single compounds, one enatiomer, the other meso) would each produce a single peak. So two peaks in total on chiral HPLC.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Wait, the first compound is chiral, but it's a single enantiomer. So on a chiral column, it would be one peak. The second is a meso compound, which is not chiral, so it would also give one peak. So yes, two peaks in total on the chiral column.

Wait, but wait. The problem says that the products are combined and run on both columns. So the question is, how many peaks in each?

But wait, the options given don't have two peaks in both. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A) 5 and 4

B) 3 and 2

C)4 and 2

D)3 and3

Wait, none of the options have 2 and 2. So maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I missed some products. Let's think again.

Wait, perhaps Reaction II produces more than one product. Let me double-check Reaction II.

Reaction II is pentane-2,4-dione treated with excess NaBH4. Pentane-2,4-dione is (CH3)CO-CH2-COCH3? Let me confirm. Structure: O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3? No, wait, pentane has five carbons. So pentane-2,4-dione would be:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. So each ketone is on carbons 2 and 4. When NaBH4 is added, each ketone is reduced to an alcohol. So the product is CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. Is this a meso compound? Because the molecule is symmetrical. So the two OH groups are on carbons 2 and 4, which are symmetric around the center. So the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. So it's a single compound, a meso diol.

So Reaction II gives one product. So the total products are two compounds: one from Reaction I (single enantiomer), and one from Reaction II (meso compound).

So when run on normal phase, two peaks. On chiral phase, two peaks as well. But the options don't have this. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I produces more than one product. Let me think again.

Reaction I is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH. LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So the product would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. But wait, could the reduction lead to any other products? Or maybe the starting material is a ketone with a stereocenter, which upon reduction doesn't change the configuration, leading to a single product. So Reaction I gives one product.

So the total products are two, leading to two peaks on both columns. But none of the options match this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the number of products. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps in Reaction I, the reduction leads to a secondary alcohol with a chiral center, and perhaps the reaction could produce some other products, but I don't think so. Because the starting ketone is S-configuration, and LAH would reduce it without changing the configuration. So only one product.

Wait, but another possibility: Could there be any other stereoisomer formed? For example, if the starting material was a racemic mixture, but no, the problem states (S)-enantiomer.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, another possibility: When NaBH4 is used on pentane-2,4-dione, could it reduce only one of the ketones, leading to a mixture? But the question says excess NaBH4, which would drive the reaction to completion. So both ketones are reduced.

Wait, but maybe the reaction could lead to more than one product. Let me think about the reduction of 2,4-pentanodione. So the product is 2,4-pentanediol, which is a meso compound, right? So it's a single compound, so only one product.

So in total, two products.

Wait, but perhaps I'm getting the structure of the products wrong. Let me think about the Reaction I's product: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. The structure is:

CH3-(CH2)2-OCH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, the starting material is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one.

Hexan-3-one is:

CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, wait. Hexan-3-one is CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3. So the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, which is (S)-CH3-CH2-C(=O)-OCH3-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait. Wait, the structure of hexan-3-one is: CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH3. Wait, no, more accurately, the structure is CH3CH2C(=O)CH2CH2CH3. So 5-methoxy would be on the fifth carbon. Let me number from the carbonyl:

Carbon 1: CH3

Carbon 2: CH2

Carbon 3: C=O

Carbon 4: CH2

Carbon 5: CH2-OCH3

Wait, no. Wait, the correct structure is:

The molecule is hexan-3-one with a methoxy group at position 5. So:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5 6

Structure: CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3?

Wait, perhaps it's better to write it as:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3. So when reduced, the CO becomes CH(OH). So the product is CH2CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3. So the structure is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, with the OH at position 3 and OCH3 at position 5.

This molecule has a chiral center at position 3. So it's a single enantiomer, so it's a single compound.

So Reaction I gives one product.

Reaction II gives one product (meso compound).

So total products are two.

On normal-phase HPLC: two peaks.

On chiral HPLC: two peaks as well.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, perhaps the products are more than what I thought. Let me think about the possibility that Reaction II produces more than one product.

Wait, another possibility: NaBH4 may not fully reduce both ketones, but the question says 'excess' NaBH4 and 100% completion. So both are reduced.

Wait, perhaps the reaction produces more than one stereoisomer. Let me think. For pentane-2,4-dione, upon reduction, you get 2,4-pentanediol. Let's see if that's a meso compound.

Structure: CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. The molecule is symmetric around the central CH2. So the two OH groups are on equivalent positions. So each OH is on a carbon that's a mirror image of the other. Therefore, the molecule is a meso compound. So it's a single compound, not a mixture of enantiomers.

So Reaction II produces no new stereoisomers, just a single compound.

So the only possible way the options have more peaks is if I made a mistake in Reaction I.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I produces more than one product. Let's think again.

(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH. LAH is a strong reducing agent. It reduces the ketone to an alcohol. So the product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. But wait, could the reduction cause any racemization? No, because LAH typically doesn't cause racemization; it's a non-stereoselective reduction only in cases where there are multiple sites, but in this case, it's a single ketone. So the product is a single enantiomer.

So no, only one product from Reaction I.

Hmm, so the initial analysis suggests two peaks in both columns, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing some aspect.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the products can form different diastereomers or other stereoisomers.

Wait, for Reaction II, perhaps I was wrong about the product being a meso compound. Let me think again. Let's number the carbons in pentane-2,4-dione as:

1  2  3  4  5

O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, pentane has five carbons. So the structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. So carbons 2 and 4 are the ketone carbons. Upon reduction, each becomes an alcohol. So the structure becomes CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. Let me check the symmetry here.

Carbons 2 and 4 have OH groups. Carbon 3 is CH2. So the molecule is symmetric with a plane of symmetry between carbons 3 and 4. So the configuration of carbon 2 and 4 are mirror images of each other. Therefore, the molecule is meso, and thus achiral. So the product is a single compound.

So, the two products are from Reaction I and II, each giving one compound. So total two compounds.

So on normal-phase, two peaks. On chiral, two peaks. But looking at the options:

Option B is 3 and 2.

Option C: 4 and 2.

Option D: 3 and 3.

Hmm. So none match with 2 and 2. So perhaps I made a mistake in counting the products.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps in Reaction II, the product is not a meso compound but a pair of enantiomers. But wait, NaBH4 is a reducing agent that doesn't have a preference for R or S configuration. So if the starting material is a symmetric diketone, the product would have two alcohol groups in a symmetric arrangement, making it a meso compound. So it can't be a pair of enantiomers, because the molecule is achiral.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the products are different. Let me think about Reaction II again. When NaBH4 reduces pentane-2,4-dione, perhaps the product is 2,4-pentanediol, which is a meso compound. So only one product.

But then, perhaps Reaction I's product is a diastereomer or something else. Wait, no, Reaction I's product is a single enantiomer.

So the only way to get more peaks is if the products have more stereoisomers than I thought.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a diastereomer of another product. No, because Reaction I is a single product.

Wait, maybe the chemist is monitoring the progress using TLC, but after 100% completion, the products are combined. So perhaps I missed some by-products.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the products themselves have additional stereocenters. Let me think.

The product from Reaction I is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. It has a single chiral center at position 3. So it's a single enantiomer.

The product from Reaction II is 2,4-pentanediol, which is a meso compound, so it's a single compound.

So that's two products.

But wait, perhaps when the products are combined, the diol could form some other structures. No, I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps during the workup, some reactions happen. But the question states the reactions are 100% complete, so no.

So I'm back to two products. So, why are the options not matching?

Perhaps I made a mistake in the number of products from each reaction. Let me re-examine each reaction.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one → LAH → (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione → NaBH4 → 2,4-pentanediol (meso), which is a single product.

So, two products in total.

But according to the options, the only possible way to get more peaks is if each product leads to multiple peaks in one of the HPLC methods.

Wait, perhaps on the chiral HPLC, the diol is a meso compound, but the hexanol is a chiral molecule. So on the chiral column, the hexanol would give one peak, and the diol would give one peak. So total two peaks on chiral.

On normal-phase, same thing: two peaks.

But the options don't have this. So I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the products are different. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps Reaction II's product is not a meso compound. Let me draw the structure again.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione is CH3-CO-CH2-CO-CH3. Upon reduction, each ketone becomes an alcohol: CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. Now, looking at the molecule, the two OH groups are on carbons 2 and 4. The molecule has a plane of symmetry between C3 and C4, making it a meso compound. So yes, it's a single compound.

Wait, but maybe I'm wrong about the structure. Let me think of another possibility. Could the product be 2,3-pentanediol or another diol? No, the starting material is 2,4-dione, so the product would be 2,4-diol.

So, perhaps the issue is that the diol is a meso compound, but in the mixture, there's another diastereomer. But no, because the starting material is symmetric, the diol is a single product.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake in the number of peaks in the chiral HPLC. Let me think: the chiral HPLC separates enantiomers. So for each chiral compound, you have a pair of enantiomers, but if you have a meso compound, it would not split into two peaks, because it's achiral.

So in our case:

Reaction I's product: chiral, single enantiomer → one peak on chiral column.

Reaction II's product: achiral → one peak on chiral column.

So, two peaks on chiral column.

On normal-phase: two peaks.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, the options are:

A) 5 Peak chiral, 4 normal → unlikely.

B)3 and 2 → maybe.

C)4 and 2 → perhaps.

D)3 and 3 → no.

Hmm. Let me think differently. Maybe in Reaction I, the product is a diastereomer, but no, it's a single enantiomer.

Wait, perhaps the products from Reaction I and II have more stereoisomers than I thought.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the product from Reaction I is a diol or something else. No, it's a single alcohol.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I's product has more than one stereocenter? Let me see the structure.

(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol: the structure is CH3-CH2-C(OH)-OCH3-CH2-CH2-CH3?

Wait, wait no. Let me write the structure correctly.

The starting material is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-OCH3-CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me number the carbons:

1 2 3 4 5 6

CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3. Wait, no, I'm getting stuck here. Let's think again.

Hexan-3-one: the carbonyl is at position 3. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3.

Wait, no, more accurately, it's:

CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3.

Wait, but with 5-methoxy, the methoxy is on carbon 5.

So the structure is:

CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3.

Upon reduction, the ketone becomes an alcohol at position 3, so:

CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3.

So the molecule has a chiral center at position 3. So it's a single enantiomer.

Thus, Reaction I's product is a single compound, a single stereoisomer.

So, I'm back to two products. So why are the options not matching?

Wait, perhaps the products are more than two. Let me think about another possibility.

Reaction I's product: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Reaction II's product: 2,4-pentanediol (meso).

But maybe, when combining the products, any possibility of creating a new stereocenter or something? I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the normal-phase HPLC would have the same number of peaks as the number of compounds, but the chiral HPLC would have peaks based on enantiomers and diastereomers.

Wait, perhaps Reaction II's product is not a meso compound. Let me think: if the diol is not meso, then it would have two enantiomers. But no, the structure is symmetric.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol is not a meso compound, but that would require the structure to not have a plane of symmetry. Let me think about the structure again.

CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3: the central CH2 is between the two OH-bearing carbons. So if I mirror the structure across the central CH2, the left and right sides are mirror images. So the molecule is indeed a meso compound.

So, it's a single compound.

So, perhaps the products are two, leading to two peaks on each column. But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of products from each reaction. Let me think again.

Reaction I: LAH reduces the ketone to the alcohol, no other reaction. So one product.

Reaction II: NaBH4 reduces both ketones to diol. One product.

So, two products.

So, the options must have two in each column, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, perhaps Reaction II's product is not a meso compound. Let me think again. Let's imagine that the diol is not meso.

Wait, another way to look at it: the two OHs are on carbons 2 and 4, which are symmetric. So the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Therefore, it's a single molecule.

Hmm. Another thought: perhaps the diol can exist in different conformations, but that wouldn't affect the HPLC peak count because conformations don't separate on HPLC.

So, I'm stuck. I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A) 5 and 4

B)3 and 2

C)4 and 2

D)3 and3.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option B: 3 peaks in chiral and 2 in normal-phase. But how?

Wait, perhaps Reaction I produces two products. Let me think again. Could the LAH reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one result in more than one product?

Wait, no. It's a single ketone, so the product is a single alcohol.

Another possibility: perhaps the reaction produces some other product, like an elimination product, but the question says the reaction is 100% complete, so that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the diol from Reaction II could have more than one stereoisomer, but I thought it was a meso compound.

Wait, let me think about another possibility. If the diol is not a meso compound, then how many stereoisomers would it have?

The diol has two chiral centers at positions 2 and 4. Each can be R or S.

Normally, for two chiral centers, there are four possible stereoisomers. But if the molecule is meso, it reduces the number. So, if the diol is a meso compound, then the possible stereoisomers are two enantiomers, but the molecule is achiral, so it's a single compound.

Wait, no. Wait, for two chiral centers, the maximum is four stereoisomers. But for a meso compound, two of them are the same (the enantiomers), so you have two pairs: a meso compound and a pair of enantiomers.

Wait, no. Let me think again. For a molecule with two chiral centers, the possible stereoisomers are up to four. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, some of them could be identical. For example, in tartaric acid, the meso form is one compound, and the other two are enantiomers.

In our case, pentane-2,4-diol (if it's a meso compound) would have two chiral centers but only one compound because of the symmetry. So, in this case, the product is a single compound.

So, Reaction II gives one product.

Thus, I'm back to two products in total.

So, perhaps the options are expecting me to think that the diol is not a meso compound, leading to two enantiomers.

Wait, but that would require the product to be a pair of enantiomers, which would mean two compounds, leading to four in total.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the structure. Let me think again.

If the product from Reaction II is 2,4-pentanediol and it's not a meso compound, then it would have two chiral centers, leading to two possible enantiomers.

Wait, no, because the molecule is symmetric, making it a meso compound. So, it's a single compound.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the products are being combined, and in the process, some other reaction happens. But the question states that the reactions are 100% completed, so other reactions are unlikely.

I'm stuck. Based on the analysis, the products are two, so two peaks on each column. But none of the options match this.

Wait, maybe the products have more than one stereocenter. Let me think about Reaction I's product.

Reaction I's product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. It has a single chiral center. So, one stereoisomer.

Reaction II's product is 2,4-pentanediol, which is meso, so one stereoisomer.

So, two products. On normal-phase, two peaks.

On chiral column, two peaks: one for the chiral compound, one for the meso.

Wait, but the meso compound is achiral, so on a chiral column, it would still appear as a single peak, as it doesn't have enantiomers.

So, two peaks on both columns.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I've made a mistake in another part.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the diol from Reaction II is not a meso compound, and thus has two enantiomers.

But earlier analysis says it's a meso compound.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the possibility that the diol is a pair of enantiomers, leading to two products. So, Reaction II produces two products.

If that's the case, then Reaction I produces one product, and Reaction II produces two.

So, total three products.

So when run on normal-phase, three peaks.

On chiral column, the diol (if it's a pair of enantiomers) would appear as one peak (since both enantiomers would co-elute), while the hexanol would be a single peak.

Wait, no. On a chiral column, a pair of enantiomers would separate into two peaks. But if the diol is a meso compound, it would be a single peak.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to summarize:

If Reaction II's product is a meso compound:

- Total products: 2.

- Normal-phase: 2 peaks.

- Chiral: 2 peaks.

If Reaction II's product is a pair of enantiomers:

- Reaction II produces two enantiomers.

- Reaction I produces one product.

- Total products: 3.

- Normal-phase: 3 peaks.

- Chiral: for the diol, two peaks (each enantiomer), plus the hexanol's single peak. So, 3 peaks in chiral HPLC.

But wait, the diol in this case would be two enantiomers, so in the chiral column, they would split into two peaks. The hexanol would be a single peak. So, total three.

On the normal-phase, the diol would be a single peak because it's a racemic mixture, and the normal-phase HPLC doesn't separate enantiomers. So the diol would appear as one peak, and the hexanol as another, leading to two peaks on normal-phase.

But this would mean the normal-phase has two peaks and the chiral has three, which would match option B (3 in chiral, 2 in normal).

But this would only be the case if the diol is a pair of enantiomers, not a meso compound.

But earlier analysis says it's a meso compound. So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure of the diol. Let me think again.

If the diol is 2,4-pentanediol, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. The molecule has a plane of symmetry between the two OHs. So, the two OHs are in equivalent positions, making it a meso compound. So the product is a single compound, a meso.

So, the initial analysis holds: two products.

Thus, the correct answer would be two peaks on both columns, but the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the diol is a diastereomer, leading to more peaks. But no, the diol is a single product.

Alternatively, perhaps I missed that the diol can have different stereocenters. Wait, but it's a meso compound, so it's a single product.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Based on all the analysis, I think the correct answer is two peaks on both columns, but that's not an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the diol is not a meso compound but exists as two diastereomers. No, that's not possible because the molecule is symmetric.

Wait, perhaps the diol can form a cyclic structure or some other isomer, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the diol has more than two stereocenters. No, the diol has two OH groups on two carbons, each of which is a stereocenter.

Hmm. I'm not making progress here. Let me look at the options again.

The only option that makes sense if I have three products is option B: 3 peaks on chiral and 2 on normal.

But how would that happen?

Ah! Wait a minute. Reaction I produces (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which is a single product.

Reaction II produces 2,4-pentanediol, which is a meso compound, but perhaps that's not the case. Wait, perhaps the diol is not a meso compound. Let me think.

If the diol is not a meso compound, then it would have two enantiomers, making two products from Reaction II.

So, Reaction I: 1 product.

Reaction II: 2 products (enantiomers).

Total: 3 products.

So, on normal-phase HPLC, the two enantiomers would co-elute, leading to two peaks (one for each diol enantiomer as a pair) and one for the hexanol. So three peaks? No, wait, no. On normal-phase, enantiomers co-elute, so the diol would be a single peak, and the hexanol another. So two peaks.

On chiral HPLC, the diol's two enantiomers would separate into two peaks, and the hexanol into one. So three peaks.

Which matches option B: 3 peaks in chiral, 2 in normal.

But earlier analysis says the diol is a meso compound, so only one product. So which is it?

Wait, perhaps the diol is a meso compound, so only one product. So two products in total, leading to two peaks on each column. But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B, assuming the diol is not a meso compound.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C: 4 and 2. But I don't see how.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I's product is actually a pair of enantiomers. No, because the starting material is a single enantiomer and the reaction doesn't change the configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol is a diastereomer, leading to more peaks. But I think that's not the case.

I'm stuck. Based on the analysis, I think the correct number of peaks would be two on each column, but the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is option B: 3 and 2.

But I'm not sure. Another thought: perhaps the diol is a meso compound, so on the chiral column, it would be one peak, and the hexanol another. So two peaks on chiral. On normal-phase, same: two peaks. But no option matches.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me think of another approach.

The question says that the products are combined and run on both columns. So, the number of peaks depends on the number of different compounds, considering their stereochemistry.

So, Reaction I: 1 product.

Reaction II: 1 product.

Total: 2 compounds.

So, normal-phase: 2 peaks.

Chiral: 2 peaks.

But options don't have this. So perhaps the products are more than two.

Wait, perhaps Reaction II's product is not a meso compound. Let me think: perhaps the diol is 2,3-pentanediol. No, the starting material is 2,4-dione, so the product is 2,4-diol.

Wait, perhaps the diol is 2,4-pentanediol, which is a meso compound, so only one product.

So, back to two products.

But perhaps I'm missing another reaction. Wait, perhaps the diol could racemize or something. No, the reaction is 100% complete, so that's not possible.

Thus, I'm forced to conclude that the correct answer is two peaks on each column, but since that's not an option, perhaps the correct option is B: 3 and 2. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the number of stereoisomers in Reaction I.

Wait, Reaction I's product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. It has a single chiral center, so it's a single enantiomer. So, one product.

Thus, the only way to get more peaks is if Reaction II produces more products.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps Reaction II's product is a diastereomer, but I don't see how.

I think I've spent enough time on this. Based on the analysis, the correct answer should be two peaks on each column, but since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is option B: 3 and 2, assuming that Reaction II's product is a pair of enantiomers, leading to three products in total.

But I'm not confident. However, given the options, I think the intended answer is option B: 3 and 2. But I'm not entirely sure.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves analyzing the products of two reactions and determining the number of peaks observed when these products are run on normal-phase and chiral HPLC columns.

### Reaction I:
- **Starting Material**: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one  
- **Reagent**: LAH (lithium aluminum hydride) followed by acidic workup  
- **Product**: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol  
- **Analysis**: LAH reduces the ketone group at position 3 to a secondary alcohol. The starting material is a single enantiomer, and the reduction does not change the configuration at the chiral center. Thus, Reaction I produces **one product**.

### Reaction II:
- **Starting Material**: Pentane-2,4-dione  
- **Reagent**: NaBH4 (excess) followed by acidic workup  
- **Product**: 2,4-pentanediol  
- **Analysis**: NaBH4 reduces both ketone groups at positions 2 and 4 to secondary alcohols. The resulting molecule, 2,4-pentanediol, is a **meso compound** due to its plane of symmetry. This means it is achiral and forms **one product**.

### Combined Products:
- Reaction I produces **(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol** (a single enantiomer).  
- Reaction II produces **2,4-pentanediol** (a meso compound, a single achiral product).  
- Total products: **two compounds**.

### HPLC Analysis:
1. **Normal-Phase HPLC**:  
   - Separation is based on polarity and physical properties.  
   - The two distinct compounds (one chiral, one achiral) will elute as **two separate peaks**.

2. **Chiral HPLC**:  
   - Separation is based on stereochemistry.  
   - The meso compound (2,4-pentanediol) is achiral and will elute as **one peak**.  
   - The chiral compound ((S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol) is a single enantiomer and will also elute as **one peak**.  
   - Total peaks: **two peaks**.

### Conclusion:
The analysis predicts **two peaks** on both the normal-phase and chiral HPLC columns. However, none of the provided options match this result. The closest match to the reasoning is **Option B (3 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC)**, which assumes the diol might not be a meso compound and could produce additional stereoisomers. Despite this inconsistency, **Option B** is selected as the answer based on the reasoning provided.

**Answer: B**
