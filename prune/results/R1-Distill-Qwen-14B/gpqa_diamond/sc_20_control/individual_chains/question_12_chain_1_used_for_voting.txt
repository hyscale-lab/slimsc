Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let's see, the question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. The reaction given is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) and nu (a neutrino, I assume). The pion is stationary, and I'm given their rest masses: the pion Pi(+) has a rest mass of 139.6 MeV, and the muon mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. The options are A to D, each giving two kinetic energies.

Hmm, I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays into other particles, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is stationary, its initial momentum is zero. So the total momentum after the decay must also be zero. That means the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

Wait, but neutrinos are neutral and have very little mass. Oh, but in reality, neutrinos do have mass, but their masses are usually negligible compared to other particles like muons. Hmm, but in this problem, are we supposed to consider the neutrino's mass? The problem statement doesn't give a rest mass for the neutrino, so I think we can assume it's massless or at least that its rest mass is negligible. So for the purpose of this problem, the neutrino's mass is zero.

So, let's think about energy and momentum conservation. The initial total energy is just the rest mass energy of the pion because it's stationary. So the initial energy is E_initial = m_pi c^2 = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. But since the neutrino is massless, its energy is just the magnitude of its momentum times c. Similarly, the muon's energy is the sum of its rest mass energy and its kinetic energy. Also, the muon's momentum is not zero because it's moving.

Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum after decay must be zero. So the muon's momentum (p_mu) must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the neutrino's momentum (p_nu). So p_mu = -p_nu. But since the neutrino is massless, p_nu = E_nu / c. And for the muon, its energy E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ). 

Wait, but E_mu is also m_mu c^2 (rest energy) plus the kinetic energy K_mu. So E_mu = m_mu c^2 + K_mu.

Let me write down the equations.

Conservation of energy:
E_pi = E_mu + E_nu
Since E_pi = m_pi c^2, which is 139.6 MeV.

Conservation of momentum:
p_mu = -p_nu
But p_nu = E_nu / c (since for massless particles, E = pc).
And p_mu = sqrt( (E_mu^2 - m_mu^2 c^4) ) / c^2 * c? Wait, not sure. Alternatively, from the relativistic energy-momentum relation:

p = sqrt( (E/c^2)^2 - (m^2 c^2) ) c. So for the muon,

p_mu = sqrt( (E_mu^2 - (m_mu c^2)^2 ) ) / (c^2) * c = sqrt(E_mu^2 - (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c.

Wait, perhaps better to write in terms of units where c=1 for simplicity. Alternatively, just work in units where c=1, so E^2 = p^2 + m^2. Then, for the muon, E_mu^2 = p_mu^2 + m_mu^2.

And since the pion is at rest, the momentum must cancel out: p_mu = - p_nu. But p_nu = E_nu, because for a massless particle, p = E.

So, p_mu = -p_nu → |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p.

Let me denote p as the magnitude of the muon's momentum (same as neutrino's because their directions are opposite). So p_mu = p, p_nu = p.

So, for the muon:
E_mu^2 = p^2 + m_mu^2.

And for the neutrino:
E_nu = p.

So, the total energy is E_mu + E_nu = ( sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) ) + p.

But E_pi = m_pi = 139.6 MeV.

So:

139.6 = sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p.

That's the equation I need to solve for p.

Let me denote m_mu = 105.7 MeV. So the equation becomes:

139.6 = sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p.

Let me rearrange it:

sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) = 139.6 - p.

Now, square both sides:

p^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.

Expand the right-hand side:

(139.6)^2 - 2*139.6*p + p^2.

So:

p^2 + 105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2*139.6 p + p^2.

Subtract p^2 from both sides:

105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2*139.6 p.

Let me calculate the squares.

105.7^2 is approximately (100 +5.7)^2 = 10000 + 2*100*5.7 + 5.7^2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 ≈ 11172.49 MeV².

Wait, actually, 105.7^2 = (105.7)^2 = let me compute it accurately.

105 *105 = 11025, 0.7^2=0.49, and cross terms: 2*105*0.7 = 147.

So 105.7^2 = (105 +0.7)^2 = 105^2 + 2*105*0.7 + 0.7^2 = 11025 + 147 + 0.49 = 11172.49 MeV².

Similarly, 139.6^2 = let's compute that:

139^2 = (140 -1)^2 = 140² - 2*140*1 +1 = 19600 -280 +1=19321. But wait, 139^2 is actually 19321? Wait, 140² is 19600, so yes.

Wait, 139.6 is 139 +0.6. So 139.6^2 = (140 -0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 +0.16 = 19488.16 MeV².

Wait, wait, wait, 0.4 squared is 0.16, yes, and 2*140*0.4 is 112. So yes.

So, 139.6^2 = 19488.16.

So back to the equation:

105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2 *139.6 p.

We have 11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 p. (Because 2 *139.6 is 279.2).

So, rearrange:

279.2 p = 19488.16 - 11172.49.

Compute 19488.16 - 11172.49:

19488.16 - 11172.49.

Let me subtract:

19488.16
-11172.49
------------
= 8315.67? Let me see, 19488 - 11172 is 8316, and .16 - .49 is -0.33. So 8315.67? Or is it 8315.67? Wait, 19488.16 minus 11172.49 is 8315.67.

So,

279.2 p = 8315.67.

So, p = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let me compute that.

Divide 8315.67 by 279.2.

Hmm, 279.2 * 30 = 8376, which is a bit more than 8315.67. So let's try 29.7.

Wait, 279.2 * 29 = 8096.8.

279.2 *29.8 = 279.2*(29 +0.8)=8096.8 + 223.36 = 8319.16.

That's a bit higher than 8315.67.

So 29.8 gives us 8319.16, which is 3.49 more than 8315.67.

So, 29.8 - (3.49 / 279.2) ≈ 29.8 -0.0125 ≈29.7875.

So p ≈29.7875 MeV/c.

Wait, but wait, the units. Because p is in MeV/c, and the energy is in MeV, since in these units c=1, so E in MeV, p in MeV/c, and m in MeV/c². So when we compute p as 29.7875, that's in MeV/c.

So p ≈29.7875 MeV/c.

Now, knowing p, we can compute E_mu and E_nu.

E_nu = p =29.7875 MeV.

Now, E_mu = sqrt(p² + m_mu²) = sqrt( (29.7875)^2 + (105.7)^2 ).

Let me compute each part.

29.7875^2 is approximately (30 -0.2125)^2 ≈900 - 2*30*0.2125 + (0.2125)^2.

Wait, 29.7875^2. Let's compute it precisely.

29.7875 *29.7875.

= (29 + 0.7875)^2 = 29² + 2*29*0.7875 + (0.7875)^2.

29² = 841.

2*29*0.7875 = 58 *0.7875.

58 *0.7 =40.6; 58 *0.0875=5.095. So 40.6+5.095=45.695.

(0.7875)^2 = (approx) 0.619140625.

So total is 841 +45.695 +0.619140625 ≈ 887.314140625.

So 29.7875^2 ≈887.3141.

m_mu^2 is 105.7^2=11172.49.

So E_mu^2 = 887.3141 +11172.49 = 12059.8041.

So E_mu = sqrt(12059.8041) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

Wait, because 109^2 is 11881, 110^2=12100.

So sqrt(12059.8) is between 109.8 and 109.9.

Let me compute 109.8^2: (109 +0.8)^2 = 109^2 + 2*109*0.8 +0.8^2 = 11881 + 174.4 +0.64= 12056.04.

Wait, 109.8^2=12056.04.

Our E_mu^2 is 12059.8041.

So the square root is 109.8 + (12059.8041 - 12056.04)/(2*109.8).

The difference is 12059.8041 - 12056.04 =3.7641.

Divide by 2*109.8=219.6.

3.7641 /219.6 ≈0.01714.

So, E_mu ≈109.8 + 0.01714 ≈109.817 MeV.

So E_mu ≈109.817 MeV.

Then, E_nu =29.7875 MeV.

Now, the total energy is E_mu +E_nu=109.817 +29.7875=139.6045 MeV, which rounds to 139.6 MeV, matching the initial E_pi. So that checks out.

Now, the kinetic energies. Kinetic energy is the total energy minus rest mass.

For the muon, K_mu = E_mu - m_mu c^2.

Since m_mu c^2 is 105.7 MeV, K_mu =109.817 -105.7=4.117 MeV ≈4.12 MeV.

For the neutrino, since its rest mass is negligible, K_nu = E_nu - m_nu c^2 ≈ E_nu =29.7875 MeV.

So the kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and about 29.79 MeV for the neutrino.

Looking at the options:

Option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That matches our calculations.

Let me check the options again:

Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.

Yes, that's what we got.

So the answer should be option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the decay process:

**Reaction:**  
\[
\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ + \nu
\]  
where the pion (\(\pi^+\)) is stationary. The rest masses are given as:  
\[
m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}, \quad m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  
The neutrino (\(\nu\)) is assumed massless (\(m_\nu = 0\)).

### Conservation Laws
1. **Energy Conservation:**  
   The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the pion:  
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = m_{\pi^+} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]  
   After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino:  
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = E_{\mu^+} + E_\nu.
   \]

2. **Momentum Conservation:**  
   Since the pion is stationary, the total momentum after decay must be zero. Thus, the magnitudes of the muon and neutrino momenta are equal and opposite:  
   \[
   p_{\mu^+} = p_\nu.
   \]

### Energy-Momentum Relation
For the muon (\(\mu^+\)), the total energy is related to its momentum and rest mass by:  
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p_{\mu^+}^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2}.
\]  
For the neutrino (\(\nu\)), since it is massless:  
\[
E_\nu = p_\nu = p_{\mu^+}.
\]

### Solving for Momentum
From energy conservation:  
\[
E_{\mu^+} + E_\nu = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  
Substituting \(E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p_{\mu^+}^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2}\) and \(E_\nu = p_{\mu^+}\):  
\[
\sqrt{p_{\mu^+}^2 + (105.7)^2} + p_{\mu^+} = 139.6.
\]  
Let \(p = p_{\mu^+}\). Rearranging:  
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + (105.7)^2} = 139.6 - p.
\]  
Squaring both sides:  
\[
p^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.
\]  
Expanding the right-hand side:  
\[
p^2 + 11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2p + p^2.
\]  
Canceling \(p^2\) and rearranging:  
\[
279.2p = 19488.16 - 11172.49.
\]  
\[
279.2p = 8315.67.
\]  
\[
p = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.79 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Calculating Energies
1. **Muon Energy:**  
   Using \(E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2}\):  
   \[
   E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{(29.79)^2 + (105.7)^2}.
   \]  
   Compute:  
   \[
   (29.79)^2 \approx 887.31, \quad (105.7)^2 = 11172.49.
   \]  
   \[
   E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{887.31 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.8} \approx 109.82 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. **Neutrino Energy:**  
   Since \(E_\nu = p\):  
   \[
   E_\nu = 29.79 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

### Kinetic Energies
1. **Muon Kinetic Energy:**  
   \[
   K_{\mu^+} = E_{\mu^+} - m_{\mu^+} = 109.82 - 105.7 = 4.12 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. **Neutrino Kinetic Energy:**  
   Since the neutrino is massless, its kinetic energy equals its total energy:  
   \[
   K_\nu = E_\nu = 29.79 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(29.8 \, \text{MeV}\), respectively. Comparing with the options:  

**Option D:** \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}, 29.8 \, \text{MeV}\).  

This matches the calculated values.

Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let's see, the question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. The reaction given is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) and nu (a neutrino, I assume). The pion is stationary, and I'm given their rest masses: the pion Pi(+) has a rest mass of 139.6 MeV, and the muon mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. The options are A to D, each giving two kinetic energies.

Hmm, I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays into other particles, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is stationary, its initial momentum is zero. So the total momentum after the decay must also be zero. That means the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

Wait, but neutrinos are neutral and have very little mass. Oh, but in reality, neutrinos do have mass, but their masses are usually negligible compared to other particles like muons. Hmm, but in this problem, are we supposed to consider the neutrino's mass? The problem statement doesn't give a rest mass for the neutrino, so I think we can assume it's massless or at least that its rest mass is negligible. So for the purpose of this problem, the neutrino's mass is zero.

So, let's think about energy and momentum conservation. The initial total energy is just the rest mass energy of the pion because it's stationary. So the initial energy is E_initial = m_pi c^2 = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. But since the neutrino is massless, its energy is just the magnitude of its momentum times c. Similarly, the muon's energy is the sum of its rest mass energy and its kinetic energy. Also, the muon's momentum is not zero because it's moving.

Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum after decay must be zero. So the muon's momentum (p_mu) must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the neutrino's momentum (p_nu). So p_mu = -p_nu. But since the neutrino is massless, p_nu = E_nu / c. And for the muon, its energy E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ). 

Wait, but E_mu is also m_mu c^2 (rest energy) plus the kinetic energy K_mu. So E_mu = m_mu c^2 + K_mu.

Let me write down the equations.

Conservation of energy:
E_pi = E_mu + E_nu
Since E_pi = m_pi c^2, which is 139.6 MeV.

Conservation of momentum:
p_mu = -p_nu
But p_nu = E_nu / c (since for massless particles, E = pc).
And p_mu = sqrt( (E_mu^2 - m_mu^2 c^4) ) / c^2 * c? Wait, not sure. Alternatively, from the relativistic energy-momentum relation:

p = sqrt( (E/c^2)^2 - (m^2 c^2) ) c. So for the muon,

p_mu = sqrt( (E_mu^2 - (m_mu c^2)^2 ) ) / (c^2) * c = sqrt(E_mu^2 - (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c.

Wait, perhaps better to write in terms of units where c=1 for simplicity. Alternatively, just work in units where c=1, so E^2 = p^2 + m^2. Then, for the muon, E_mu^2 = p_mu^2 + m_mu^2.

And since the pion is at rest, the momentum must cancel out: p_mu = - p_nu. But p_nu = E_nu, because for a massless particle, p = E.

So, p_mu = -p_nu → |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p.

Let me denote p as the magnitude of the muon's momentum (same as neutrino's because their directions are opposite). So p_mu = p, p_nu = p.

So, for the muon:
E_mu^2 = p^2 + m_mu^2.

And for the neutrino:
E_nu = p.

So, the total energy is E_mu + E_nu = ( sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) ) + p.

But E_pi = m_pi = 139.6 MeV.

So:

139.6 = sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p.

That's the equation I need to solve for p.

Let me denote m_mu = 105.7 MeV. So the equation becomes:

139.6 = sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p.

Let me rearrange it:

sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) = 139.6 - p.

Now, square both sides:

p^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.

Expand the right-hand side:

(139.6)^2 - 2*139.6*p + p^2.

So:

p^2 + 105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2*139.6 p + p^2.

Subtract p^2 from both sides:

105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2*139.6 p.

Let me calculate the squares.

105.7^2 is approximately (100 +5.7)^2 = 10000 + 2*100*5.7 + 5.7^2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 ≈ 11172.49 MeV².

Wait, actually, 105.7^2 = (105.7)^2 = let me compute it accurately.

105 *105 = 11025, 0.7^2=0.49, and cross terms: 2*105*0.7 = 147.

So 105.7^2 = (105 +0.7)^2 = 105^2 + 2*105*0.7 + 0.7^2 = 11025 + 147 + 0.49 = 11172.49 MeV².

Similarly, 139.6^2 = let's compute that:

139^2 = (140 -1)^2 = 140² - 2*140*1 +1 = 19600 -280 +1=19321. But wait, 139^2 is actually 19321? Wait, 140² is 19600, so yes.

Wait, 139.6 is 139 +0.6. So 139.6^2 = (140 -0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 +0.16 = 19488.16 MeV².

Wait, wait, wait, 0.4 squared is 0.16, yes, and 2*140*0.4 is 112. So yes.

So, 139.6^2 = 19488.16.

So back to the equation:

105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2 *139.6 p.

We have 11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 p. (Because 2 *139.6 is 279.2).

So, rearrange:

279.2 p = 19488.16 - 11172.49.

Compute 19488.16 - 11172.49:

19488.16 - 11172.49.

Let me subtract:

19488.16
-11172.49
------------
= 8315.67? Let me see, 19488 - 11172 is 8316, and .16 - .49 is -0.33. So 8315.67? Or is it 8315.67? Wait, 19488.16 minus 11172.49 is 8315.67.

So,

279.2 p = 8315.67.

So, p = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let me compute that.

Divide 8315.67 by 279.2.

Hmm, 279.2 * 30 = 8376, which is a bit more than 8315.67. So let's try 29.7.

Wait, 279.2 * 29 = 8096.8.

279.2 *29.8 = 279.2*(29 +0.8)=8096.8 + 223.36 = 8319.16.

That's a bit higher than 8315.67.

So 29.8 gives us 8319.16, which is 3.49 more than 8315.67.

So, 29.8 - (3.49 / 279.2) ≈ 29.8 -0.0125 ≈29.7875.

So p ≈29.7875 MeV/c.

Wait, but wait, the units. Because p is in MeV/c, and the energy is in MeV, since in these units c=1, so E in MeV, p in MeV/c, and m in MeV/c². So when we compute p as 29.7875, that's in MeV/c.

So p ≈29.7875 MeV/c.

Now, knowing p, we can compute E_mu and E_nu.

E_nu = p =29.7875 MeV.

Now, E_mu = sqrt(p² + m_mu²) = sqrt( (29.7875)^2 + (105.7)^2 ).

Let me compute each part.

29.7875^2 is approximately (30 -0.2125)^2 ≈900 - 2*30*0.2125 + (0.2125)^2.

Wait, 29.7875^2. Let's compute it precisely.

29.7875 *29.7875.

= (29 + 0.7875)^2 = 29² + 2*29*0.7875 + (0.7875)^2.

29² = 841.

2*29*0.7875 = 58 *0.7875.

58 *0.7 =40.6; 58 *0.0875=5.095. So 40.6+5.095=45.695.

(0.7875)^2 = (approx) 0.619140625.

So total is 841 +45.695 +0.619140625 ≈ 887.314140625.

So 29.7875^2 ≈887.3141.

m_mu^2 is 105.7^2=11172.49.

So E_mu^2 = 887.3141 +11172.49 = 12059.8041.

So E_mu = sqrt(12059.8041) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

Wait, because 109^2 is 11881, 110^2=12100.

So sqrt(12059.8) is between 109.8 and 109.9.

Let me compute 109.8^2: (109 +0.8)^2 = 109^2 + 2*109*0.8 +0.8^2 = 11881 + 174.4 +0.64= 12056.04.

Wait, 109.8^2=12056.04.

Our E_mu^2 is 12059.8041.

So the square root is 109.8 + (12059.8041 - 12056.04)/(2*109.8).

The difference is 12059.8041 - 12056.04 =3.7641.

Divide by 2*109.8=219.6.

3.7641 /219.6 ≈0.01714.

So, E_mu ≈109.8 + 0.01714 ≈109.817 MeV.

So E_mu ≈109.817 MeV.

Then, E_nu =29.7875 MeV.

Now, the total energy is E_mu +E_nu=109.817 +29.7875=139.6045 MeV, which rounds to 139.6 MeV, matching the initial E_pi. So that checks out.

Now, the kinetic energies. Kinetic energy is the total energy minus rest mass.

For the muon, K_mu = E_mu - m_mu c^2.

Since m_mu c^2 is 105.7 MeV, K_mu =109.817 -105.7=4.117 MeV ≈4.12 MeV.

For the neutrino, since its rest mass is negligible, K_nu = E_nu - m_nu c^2 ≈ E_nu =29.7875 MeV.

So the kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and about 29.79 MeV for the neutrino.

Looking at the options:

Option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That matches our calculations.

Let me check the options again:

Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.

Yes, that's what we got.

So the answer should be option D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the decay process:

**Reaction:**  
\[
\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ + \nu
\]  
where the pion (\(\pi^+\)) is stationary. The rest masses are given as:  
\[
m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}, \quad m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  
The neutrino (\(\nu\)) is assumed massless (\(m_\nu = 0\)).

### Conservation Laws
1. **Energy Conservation:**  
   The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the pion:  
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = m_{\pi^+} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]  
   After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino:  
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = E_{\mu^+} + E_\nu.
   \]

2. **Momentum Conservation:**  
   Since the pion is stationary, the total momentum after decay must be zero. Thus, the magnitudes of the muon and neutrino momenta are equal and opposite:  
   \[
   p_{\mu^+} = p_\nu.
   \]

### Energy-Momentum Relation
For the muon (\(\mu^+\)), the total energy is related to its momentum and rest mass by:  
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p_{\mu^+}^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2}.
\]  
For the neutrino (\(\nu\)), since it is massless:  
\[
E_\nu = p_\nu = p_{\mu^+}.
\]

### Solving for Momentum
From energy conservation:  
\[
E_{\mu^+} + E_\nu = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  
Substituting \(E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p_{\mu^+}^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2}\) and \(E_\nu = p_{\mu^+}\):  
\[
\sqrt{p_{\mu^+}^2 + (105.7)^2} + p_{\mu^+} = 139.6.
\]  
Let \(p = p_{\mu^+}\). Rearranging:  
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + (105.7)^2} = 139.6 - p.
\]  
Squaring both sides:  
\[
p^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.
\]  
Expanding the right-hand side:  
\[
p^2 + 11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2p + p^2.
\]  
Canceling \(p^2\) and rearranging:  
\[
279.2p = 19488.16 - 11172.49.
\]  
\[
279.2p = 8315.67.
\]  
\[
p = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.79 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Calculating Energies
1. **Muon Energy:**  
   Using \(E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2}\):  
   \[
   E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{(29.79)^2 + (105.7)^2}.
   \]  
   Compute:  
   \[
   (29.79)^2 \approx 887.31, \quad (105.7)^2 = 11172.49.
   \]  
   \[
   E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{887.31 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.8} \approx 109.82 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. **Neutrino Energy:**  
   Since \(E_\nu = p\):  
   \[
   E_\nu = 29.79 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

### Kinetic Energies
1. **Muon Kinetic Energy:**  
   \[
   K_{\mu^+} = E_{\mu^+} - m_{\mu^+} = 109.82 - 105.7 = 4.12 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. **Neutrino Kinetic Energy:**  
   Since the neutrino is massless, its kinetic energy equals its total energy:  
   \[
   K_\nu = E_\nu = 29.79 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(29.8 \, \text{MeV}\), respectively. Comparing with the options:  

**Option D:** \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}, 29.8 \, \text{MeV}\).  

This matches the calculated values.
