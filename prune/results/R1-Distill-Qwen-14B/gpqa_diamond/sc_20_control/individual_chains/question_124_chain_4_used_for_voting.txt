Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about particles being collided in a spherical detector. These particles are new types that decay quickly and are traveling at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters. The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of these particles reach the inner walls instead of one third.

Hmm. So the key here seems to be the relationship between the particles' speed (as influenced by their Lorentz factor) and the detector's size. Since the particles are moving at relativistic speeds, their Lorentz factor γ will affect how much time they have to travel before decaying.

Wait, ultra-relativistic particles... right, so their velocity is very close to the speed of light. The Lorentz factor γ is given by γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). At v ≈ c, γ is large.

The problem states that when γ is 20, only about a third (1/3) of the particles reach the inner wall. So, I think this has to do with the particles' lifetime and how far they can travel before decaying.

Wait, particles that decay quickly—so their lifetime is such that the distance they can travel before decaying depends on their speed and lifetime. The ones that reach the detector's inner walls must have a lifetime that allows them to travel the radius of the detector within their lifetime.

So, the particles are produced at the center of the detector, right? So the distance they need to travel to reach the inner wall is 30 meters. Let's denote that as R = 30 m.

The particles' lifetime as measured in the lab frame (the detector's frame) would be their proper lifetime multiplied by their Lorentz factor, because time dilation occurs. So, the lifetime τ in the lab frame is τ_lab = γ * τ_0, where τ_0 is the proper lifetime.

The distance a particle travels before decaying is v * τ_lab. But since v is approximately c (ultra-relativistic), we can approximate v ≈ c. So, the distance is c * τ_lab = c * γ * τ_0.

For the particle to reach the detector's inner wall, this distance must be at least R = 30 m. So, c * γ * τ_0 ≥ R.

Wait, but the problem says that when γ is 20, only a third of the particles make it. So I think that the number of particles that reach the wall is determined by the fraction that have a lifetime long enough to make the trip. So when γ is higher, more particles reach the wall because their lab frame lifetime is longer.

Wait, but wait. The problem states that when γ is 20, only 1/3 reach the wall. So, perhaps when γ increases, the fraction that reach the wall increases. So to get two-thirds, we need a higher γ.

But how does the fraction relate to γ? Hmm. Maybe the distribution of particles is such that the number that reach the wall depends on the available time. Alternatively, perhaps the decay is exponential, and the survival probability is determined by the mean lifetime.

Alternatively, perhaps the fraction is inversely proportional to the square of the Lorentz factor, but I'm not sure. Hmm. Let me think again.

When a particle is moving at a high speed, it can travel a longer distance before decaying. The distance it can travel is c * γ τ_0. For it to reach the detector, this distance must be greater than R.

But wait, maybe the particles are produced in all directions, and their decay is isotropic in their rest frame. So in the lab frame, their decay products would be moving in a certain way, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Wait, perhaps the probability that a given particle reaches the detector wall depends on the ratio of the time it takes to reach the wall compared to its mean lifetime. So, the proper lifetime is τ_0, and the lab lifetime is γ τ_0. The time to reach the wall is t = R/(v). Since v ≈ c, t ≈ R/(c).

So, the time to reach the wall is t = R/(c) = 30 m / (3e8 m/s) = 1e-7 seconds? Let me compute that: 30 / 3e8 = 1e-7 s, yes.

The lifetime in the lab frame is γ τ_0. So, the probability that the particle hasn't decayed yet when it reaches the wall would be P = exp(-t/(γ τ_0)).

Wait, that makes sense because the decay follows an exponential process. The survival probability is e^(-t/(τ_lab)), where τ_lab = γ τ_0.

So, the probability that the particle reaches the wall is P = e^(-t/(γ τ_0)).

Wait, but when t is the time it takes to reach the wall, which is R/(v) ≈ R/c.

So, substituting t = R/(c), then P = e^(-R/(c γ τ_0)).

In the case where γ =20, we have P = 1/3. So,

1/3 = e^(- R/(c * 20 τ_0 )).

Taking natural logs on both sides:

ln(1/3) = - R/(c * 20 τ_0 )

Which becomes:

ln(3) = R/(c * 20 τ_0 )

So,

R/(20 τ_0 c) = ln(3)

Wait, but I can solve for τ_0:

τ_0 = R/(20 c ln(3)).

But I'm more interested in finding the new γ (let's call it γ_new) that gives P_new = 2/3.

So,

2/3 = e^(- R/(c γ_new τ_0 )).

Taking the same approach:

ln(2/3) = - R/(c γ_new τ_0 )

Multiply both sides by -1:

ln(3/2) = R/(c γ_new τ_0 )

From earlier, we have R = 20 c τ_0 ln(3). Wait, wait, let me go back.

Wait, from the first equation:

ln(3) = R/(c * 20 τ_0 )

So,

R = c * 20 τ_0 ln(3).

So, substitute R into the second equation:

ln(3/2) = (c * 20 τ_0 ln(3)) ) / (c γ_new τ_0 )

Simplify:

ln(3/2) = (20 ln(3)) ) / γ_new

Solve for γ_new:

γ_new = (20 ln(3)) / ln(3/2 )

Compute the numerical values.

I know that ln(3) ≈ 1.0986, and ln(3/2) ≈ 0.4055.

So,

γ_new ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055

Calculate numerator: 20 *1.0986 ≈ 21.972

Divide by 0.4055: 21.972 / 0.4055 ≈ let's compute.

0.4055 * 54 = 21.9 (since 54 *0.4 =21.6, 54 *0.0055=0.297, total≈21.897). So 54 would give about 21.897, which is very close to 21.972.

Wait, so 54 would give approximately 21.897, which is slightly less than 21.972. So maybe 54. Let me compute more accurately.

Compute 21.972 / 0.4055.

Let me compute 0.4055 × 54 = 54 × 0.4 is 21.6, 54 × 0.0055 is 0.297, total 21.897.

We have 21.972-21.897=0.075 left.

So 0.075 / 0.4055 ≈ 0.1848.

So total γ_new ≈54 +0.1848 ≈54.18.

Looking at the options, option A is 54, option B is 68, C is40, D is28. So 54 is an option, but wait, the calculation gave about 54.18, which is very close to 54.

But wait, let me double-check my steps. Because the question says that when gamma is 20, 1/3 reach the wall. So, when gamma increases, more reach the wall, which makes sense because their lifetime is longer.

In our calculation, gamma_new is approximately 54, which is option A.

Wait, but wait a moment. Let me check the calculations again because sometimes the math can be tricky.

Wait, the equation we had was:

ln(3/2) = (20 ln(3)) / γ_new

Which can be rearranged as:

gamma_new = (20 ln(3)) / ln(3/2 )

So, computing:

ln(3) ≈1.098612289

ln(3/2) ≈0.4054651081

So,

20 *1.098612289 ≈21.97224578

21.97224578 / 0.4054651081 ≈ let me compute that.

Divide 21.97224578 by 0.4054651081.

Let me compute 0.4054651081 × 54 = 21.9 (approximate). Let me compute it exactly:

54 × 0.4054651081 = 54 * 0.4 =21.6, 54 *0.0054651081 =54 *0.005=0.27, 54 * 0.0004651081≈0.0251158. So, 21.6+0.27=21.87+0.0251158=21.8951.

But our numerator is 21.97224578. So 54 gives 21.8951. The difference is 21.97224578 -21.8951=0.07714578.

So, 0.07714578 / 0.4054651081 ≈ 0.07714578 /0.405465≈0.19.

So, 54.19 would be the value, approximately.

Looking at the options, option A is 54. So that's the answer.

But wait, I should think about whether I used the right probabilities. Let me recap.

When gamma is 20, the probability is 1/3. So,

1/3 = exp( - R/(c gamma tau_0) )

Then, when gamma increases, R/(c gamma tau_0) decreases, so the exponent becomes less negative, making the probability higher.

So, for two-thirds, 2/3, which is higher than 1/3, the exponent would be less negative. So, that makes sense because gamma is higher.

Yes, the calculation seems correct.

To determine the Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector's inner walls, we analyze the relationship between the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \), the particles' lifetime, and the distance they travel before decaying.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Distance to Travel**: The particles are produced at the center of the detector and must travel a distance equal to the detector's radius \( R = 30 \, \text{m} \) to reach the inner walls.

2. **Relativistic Lifetime**: The lifetime of the particles in the lab frame is extended due to time dilation, given by \( \tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \tau_0 \), where \( \tau_0 \) is the proper lifetime and \( \gamma = 1 / \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} \).

3. **Survival Probability**: The probability that a particle reaches the detector's walls is determined by the exponential decay law:
   \[
   P = e^{-t / \tau_{\text{lab}}}
   \]
   where \( t = R / v \) is the time it takes for the particle to travel the distance \( R \). Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, \( v \approx c \), so \( t \approx R / c \).

4. **Given Condition**: When \( \gamma = 20 \), only \( 1/3 \) of the particles reach the walls. This implies:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} = e^{-R / (c \gamma \tau_0)}
   \]
   Taking the natural logarithm:
   \[
   \ln(1/3) = -\frac{R}{c \gamma \tau_0}
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   \ln(3) = \frac{R}{c \gamma \tau_0}
   \]
   Substituting \( \gamma = 20 \):
   \[
   \ln(3) = \frac{R}{c (20 \tau_0)}
   \]
   Solving for \( \tau_0 \):
   \[
   \tau_0 = \frac{R}{20 c \ln(3)}
   \]

5. **New Condition**: For two-thirds of the particles to reach the walls, the survival probability must be \( P = 2/3 \). Using the same exponential formula:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} = e^{-R / (c \gamma_{\text{new}} \tau_0)}
   \]
   Taking the natural logarithm:
   \[
   \ln(2/3) = -\frac{R}{c \gamma_{\text{new}} \tau_0}
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   \ln(3/2) = \frac{R}{c \gamma_{\text{new}} \tau_0}
   \]
   Substituting \( \tau_0 = \frac{R}{20 c \ln(3)} \) from earlier:
   \[
   \ln(3/2) = \frac{R}{c \gamma_{\text{new}} \left(\frac{R}{20 c \ln(3)}\right)}
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   \ln(3/2) = \frac{20 \ln(3)}{\gamma_{\text{new}}}
   \]
   Solving for \( \gamma_{\text{new}} \):
   \[
   \gamma_{\text{new}} = \frac{20 \ln(3)}{\ln(3/2)}
   \]

6. **Numerical Calculation**:
   - \( \ln(3) \approx 1.0986 \)
   - \( \ln(3/2) \approx 0.4055 \)
   Substituting:
   \[
   \gamma_{\text{new}} = \frac{20 \times 1.0986}{0.4055} \approx 54.18
   \]
   The closest option is \( \gamma_{\text{new}} = 54 \).

### Conclusion:
To have about two-thirds of the particles reach the detector's inner walls, the required Lorentz factor is approximately **54**.
