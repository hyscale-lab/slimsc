Okay, so I have this physics problem here about gamma-ray annihilation with the CMB photons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is asking for the energy at which a gamma-ray's lifetime in the universe is limited by the process gamma-gamma -> e+ e-. So, this is about the interaction of high-energy gamma-rays with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation. I remember that when a high-energy photon interacts with a low-energy photon, like a CMB photon, they can annihilate into electron-positron pairs if the energy is sufficient.

Wait, so photons are all around, especially the CMB. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. So, the gamma-ray is high energy, and the CMB photon is low energy.

I think the process is called the photon-photon interaction, and the cross-section for this process rises when the center-of-mass energy is above a certain threshold. The threshold for electron-positron pair production is when the combined energy is at least twice the rest mass of an electron, which is about 1.02 MeV. But wait, the CMB photons are really low energy, so maybe that's not the main factor here.

Wait, no, I think the cross-section for this annihilation process depends on the energy of the gamma-ray relative to the CMB photon. The problem is about the photon's lifetime being limited by this process, which means that the gamma-ray would lose energy quickly through such interactions, limiting how far it can travel or how long it can exist.

So, the photon's mean lifetime due to this process would be determined by the interaction rate. The interaction rate depends on the cross-section and the number density of the CMB photons.

The cross-section for photon-photon annihilation into electron-positron pairs is known, I think it's given by some formula. I remember that for high-energy photons, the cross-section increases as the energy increases. At energies where the center-of-mass energy is much larger than the electron mass, the cross-section is given by the so-called "Bethe-Heitler" formula or maybe the "Dokshitzer" formula. But I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, the cross-section sigma for gamma gamma -> e+ e- is approximately sigma ~ (8π/3) * (α^2 / (s)) * (4m_e^2 + s), where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy. Or perhaps another form. Alternatively, for s >> m_e^2, it simplifies to sigma ≈ (8π/3) * (α^2 / s). Because when s is much larger than m_e squared, the 4m_e^2 term becomes negligible.

So, the cross-section sigma is inversely proportional to s, where s is (E1 + E2)^2 or something like that? Wait, no, the center of mass energy squared is s=(E1+E2)^2 - (p1c + p2c)^2. But since the CMB photons are moving in all directions, but for a gamma-ray moving in one direction, the energies add in the center-of-momentum frame. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the center-of-mass energy.

Alternatively, considering that the CMB has a thermal spectrum, but the average energy is given as 1e-3 eV. So the typical CMB photon energy is E_cm ~ 1e-3 eV. The gamma-ray has energy E. So the center-of-mass energy squared would be s = (E + E_cm)^2. But wait, actually, the correct expression for the center-of-mass energy when two photons are colliding head-on is s = (E_gamma + E_CMB)^2 - (pc)^2. But photons have E = pc, so for a gamma-ray and a CMB photon moving in opposite directions, the actual calculation is a bit more involved.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to model the scenario where the gamma-ray is moving with energy E, and the CMB photon is a low-energy photon with energy epsilon (1e-3 eV). So, for a head-on collision, the center-of-mass energy squared s is (E + epsilon)^2 - (E - epsilon)^2 (since the momenta are opposite). Wait, no, let me think: if the gamma-ray is moving in the +x direction with energy E, and the CMB photon is moving in the -x direction with energy epsilon, then their momenta are E/(c) in opposite directions.

Wait, but photons have momentum p = E/(c). So for the gamma-ray, p_gamma = E/(c), and for the CMB photon, p_CMB = epsilon/(c) in the opposite direction.

So the total energy in the center of mass frame would be E_gamma + E_CMB (since both are energy), and the momentum vectors would sum to (p_gamma - p_CMB) (since they are opposite). Wait, no, the magnitude would be (p_gamma + p_CMB) if they're moving towards each other. Hmm, perhaps I should just calculate s.

s is the Mandelstam variable s, which is (p1 + p2)^2, where p1 and p2 are the four-momenta of the two photons. So, for photons moving in opposite directions, s would be:

s = (E1 + E2)^2 - ( (p1 c) - (p2 c) )^2.

But since E1 = p1 c and E2 = p2 c, because photons have E=pc. So, s becomes (E1 + E2)^2 - ( (E1 - E2) )^2.

Expanding that: (E1^2 + 2 E1 E2 + E2^2) - (E1^2 - 2 E1 E2 + E2^2) ) = 4 E1 E2.

So s = 4 E1 E2.

Oh, that's a useful result. So the center-of-mass energy squared is four times the product of the two photon energies.

So, in our case, E1 is the gamma-ray energy (E), E2 is the CMB photon energy (epsilon ~ 1e-3 eV). So s=4 E epsilon.

Wait, but the cross-section depends on s. Earlier I thought the cross-section sigma is proportional to 1/s, but for high energies, maybe there's another dependence.

Hmm, the cross-section for pair production is given by sigma = (8 pi/3) (alpha^2 m_e^2) / (s) * (4 m_e^2 + s), but for high energies where s >> m_e^2, this reduces to sigma ≈ (8 pi/3 alpha^2 m_e^2) / s.

Wait, no, let me double-check. The formula for the cross-section when s >> 4 m_e^2 is sigma ≈ (8 pi/3) (alpha^2 / (s)) ) * ( (s + 4 m_e^2 ) ), but when s is much larger than m_e^2, the 4 m_e^2 can be neglected, so sigma ≈ (8 pi/3) (alpha^2 / s) * s? Wait, that can't be right because that would make sigma proportional to 8 pi/3 alpha^2, but that doesn't depend on s. Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong.

Wait, no, I think the correct formula for the cross-section when s is much larger than m_e^2 is sigma ≈ (8 pi/3) (alpha^2) * (m_e^2 / s). Wait, but that would mean sigma decreases as s increases, which makes sense because higher energies lead to lower cross-sections. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the cross-section has a different dependence.

Wait, another approach: the photon-photon cross-section for pair production is given by:

sigma = ( (8 π α²) / (3 s) ) * (1 + (2 m_e²)/s ) )

So when s is much larger than 2 m_e², the second term is negligible, and sigma ≈ (8 π α²) / (3 s).

But wait, I'm not confident about this. Maybe I should look it up in my memory. Oh, I remember that the cross-section for photon-photon annihilation into pairs is sigma = ( (8 π α²)/(3 s) ) * (1 + 2 (m_e c²)^2 / (s c^4) ) ) * c^4 ?

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing units here. Let me think in terms of energy units. Let's say that s is in energy squared units. So, m_e c² is about 0.511 MeV.

So, sigma ≈ (8 π α²)/(3 s) ) * (1 + 2 (m_e² c^4)/(s c^4) )) ), but I'm getting tangled in the units. Maybe it's better to write in terms of s being in (energy)^2.

Alternatively, perhaps the cross-section is sigma ≈ (8 π α²)/(3 s), which for high energies, s is large, so the cross-section is small.

But the problem is about the interaction rate. So the interaction rate (gamma per unit time) depends on the cross-section multiplied by the number density of the target photons.

So, the number density of CMB photons can be found from the CMB photon density. The CMB has a temperature T, and the photon number density is (for a photon gas) given by n_photon = (g_{3/2}(4/π) k_B^3 T^3) ) / (h^3), but perhaps more accurately, the number density u is given by u = a T^3, where a is the radiation constant. But perhaps for order of magnitude, I can use a known value.

Wait, the CMB temperature is about 2.7 K, so T ≈ 2.7 K. The number density of CMB photons is about n ~ 411 photons/cm³. Let me see, I remember that the number density of CMB photons is roughly 411 cm^-3, which is 4.11e+07 m^-3 (since 1 cm³ is 1e-6 m³, so 411 / 1e-6 m³ = 4.11e6 m^-3? Wait, wait, no: 1 cm³ = 1e-6 m³. So 411 photons/cm³ is 411 per 1e-6 m³, which is 411e6 m^-3, so 4.11e8 m^-3. Hmm, maybe I should check that number.

Alternatively, I can calculate it using the formula for the number density of photons in a blackbody spectrum at temperature T:

n_photon ≈ (g_{3/2}(ζ(3)) ) * ( (8 π k_B^3) / (h^3 c^3) ) ) * T^3 )

But maybe I can just use a standard value. I think the number density of CMB photons is approximately 411 cm^-3, which is 4.11e8 m^-3.

So, putting that together, the interaction rate per gamma-ray is Gamma = n_photon * sigma * v, where v is the velocity of the gamma-ray. But since gamma-rays are massless, v = c.

Wait, but wait, the cross-section formula is for the process, but the interaction rate would be Gamma = n_photon * sigma * c. Because the proper way to compute the interaction rate is n * sigma * v, where v is the relative velocity. But since the gamma and CMB photons are moving in opposite directions, their relative speed is 2c, but for the purpose of cross-section per unit volume, perhaps the speed is considered as c. I'm a bit confused here, but perhaps it's better to model it as the typical rate.

Wait, no, the rate is usually given by Gamma = n * sigma * v_rel, where v_rel is the relative velocity. For head-on collisions, the relative velocity is 2c, but since in reality, the CMB photons are in all directions, the average might be higher. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model it as the cross-section multiplied by the number density, multiplied by the velocity of the gamma-ray. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, the interaction rate is given by Gamma = n_photon * sigma * c, because the gamma is moving at speed c, and the cross-section is per unit volume.

But regardless, the lifetime of the gamma-ray would be the inverse of the interaction rate: tau = 1/Gamma = 1/(n_photon * sigma * c).

Wait, no, because Gamma is the rate of interaction events per unit time, so tau would be 1/Gamma.

So, let's model the lifetime as tau = 1/(n_photon * sigma * c).

The problem states that the gamma-ray's lifetime is limited by this process, meaning that the gamma-ray can't travel farther than about c * tau, and this must be less than the age of the universe or something, but perhaps the question is just asking for the energy where the interaction rate becomes significant, so that the lifetime is shorter than a certain value.

Alternatively, perhaps the condition is that the photon's lifetime due to this process is equal to the age of the universe, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the energy where the interaction rate becomes so high that the gamma-ray would lose energy quickly.

But perhaps the problem is to find the energy E such that the cross-section multiplied by the number density and the photon speed gives a lifetime that is a certain value. Like, when the lifetime equals the age of the universe, beyond that energy, the photon can't exist, so the energy where the lifetime is comparable to the age of the universe.

Wait, but the problem says "their lifetimes in the universe would be limited by this process." So, the gamma-ray's lifetime is determined by this interaction, so we need to find E such that the lifetime is the age of the universe, perhaps.

Wait, but the age of the universe is about 13.8 billion years, which is roughly 4.3e17 seconds. So, let's say the lifetime tau is about 1e17 seconds. So, for the gamma-ray to have its lifetime limited by this process, tau should be around that.

So, let's write the formula for tau.

tau = 1/(n_photon * sigma * c)

But sigma is (8 π α²)/(3 s) ) for high energies, where s=4 E epsilon.

Wait, so s=4 E epsilon.

Therefore, sigma = (8 π α²)/(3 * 4 E epsilon) ) = (2 π α^2)/(3 E epsilon).

So, substituting into tau:

tau = 1/(n_photon * (2 π α^2/(3 E epsilon)) * c )

= (3 E epsilon) / ( 2 π α^2 n_photon c )

Now, solving for E:

E = (tau * 2 π α^2 n_photon c ) / (3 epsilon )

But wait, we can rearrange to solve for E:

E = (tau * 2 π α^2 n_photon c ) / (3 epsilon )

So, E is proportional to tau/(epsilon).

Wait, but we can substitute the numbers.

Let me collect all the constants and plug them in.

Constants:

n_photon = 411 cm^-3 = 4.11e8 m^-3.

alpha is the fine-structure constant, approximately 1/137 ≈ 0.007297.

epsilon is the average CMB photon energy, 1e-3 eV = 1e-3 eV.

c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s.

Tau is the age of the universe, approx 4.3e17 seconds.

So, let's compute numerator and denominator.

Compute numerator: 2 π α^2 n_photon c tau.

So, let's compute each term:

alpha ≈ 1/137 ≈ 0.007297.

alpha^2 ≈ (0.007297)^2 ≈ 5.32e-5.

n_photon = 4.11e8 m^-3.

c=3e8 m/s.

tau=4.3e17 s.

epsilon=1e-3 eV.

So,

Numerator: 2 * pi * (5.32e-5) * (4.11e8) * (3e8) * (4.3e17 )

Denominator: 3 * (1e-3 eV)

Wait, but let's compute numerator:

2 * pi ≈ 6.2832.

6.2832 * 5.32e-5 ≈ 3.34e-4.

3.34e-4 * 4.11e8 ≈ (3.34 * 4.11) )e4 ≈ 13.73e4 = 1.373e5.

1.373e5 * 3e8 ≈ 4.119e13.

4.119e13 * 4.3e17 = 4.119e13 *4.3e17 = (4.119 *4.3) )e30 ≈ 17.7e30 = 1.77e31.

So numerator is 1.77e31.

Denominator: 3 * 1e-3 eV = 3e-3 eV.

So,

E = (1.77e31) / (3e-3 eV) ) = (1.77e31) / (3e-3) ) eV.

1.77e31 / 3e-3 = (1.77/3 )e34 = 0.59e34 = 5.9e33 eV.

Wait, 5.9e33 eV is a huge energy. But looking at the options, the highest is D) 3.9e5 GeV. Wait, 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, so 5.9e33 eV is 5.9e24 GeV. That's way higher than any of the options. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation. Let me try again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the expression for tau. Let me double-check.

Earlier, I had:

tau = (3 E epsilon) / ( 2 pi alpha^2 n_photon c )

So, solving for E:

E = (tau * 2 pi alpha^2 n_photon c ) / (3 epsilon )

Wait, but wait, I think I might have missed a factor. Let's re-derive tau.

The interaction rate is Gamma = n_photon * sigma * c.

So, tau = 1/Gamma = 1/(n_photon sigma c )

But sigma = (8 pi alpha^2)/(3 s ), and s=4 E epsilon.

So, sigma = (8 pi alpha^2 )/(3 * 4 E epsilon ) = (2 pi alpha^2 )/(3 E epsilon )

So,

Gamma = n_photon * (2 pi alpha^2)/(3 E epsilon ) * c.

So,

tau = 1/(Gamma) = 3 E epsilon / ( 2 pi alpha^2 n_photon c )

So,

E = (tau * 2 pi alpha^2 n_photon c )/(3 epsilon )

Wait, I think I have the right expression now.

So, let's compute the values again.

Compute numerator: 2 pi alpha^2 n_photon c tau.

Compute each part:

2 pi ≈ 6.283.

alpha^2 ≈ (1/137)^2 ≈ 5.32e-5.

n_photon = 4.11e8 m^-3.

c = 3e8 m/s.

tau = 4.3e17 s.

Multiply all together:

6.283 * 5.32e-5 = approx 6.283 * 5.32e-5 ≈ 3.34e-4.

3.34e-4 * 4.11e8 = approx 3.34e-4 *4.11e8 = (3.34 *4.11) )e( -4 +8 ) = 13.73e4 = 1.373e5.

1.373e5 * 3e8 = 4.119e13.

4.119e13 *4.3e17 = (4.119 *4.3 )e30 ≈ 17.7e30 = 1.77e31.

Denominator: 3 * epsilon = 3 * 1e-3 eV = 3e-3 eV.

So,

E = (1.77e31) / (3e-3 eV ) = (1.77e31) / (3e-3 ) eV.

So 1.77e31 / 3e-3 = (1.77 /3 )e34 = 0.59e34 = 5.9e33 eV.

Wait, that's 5.9e33 eV, which is 5.9e24 TeV, which is way beyond what the options suggest. The options are all around 1e5 GeV, which is 1e14 eV. So, I must have made a mistake.

Hmm, perhaps I messed up the calculation somewhere. Let me check the exponents.

Wait, 4.11e8 m^-3 is correct.

Wait, let's re-calculate the numerator step by step.

Compute 2 * pi = 6.2832.

alpha^2 = (1/137)^2 ≈ 5.318e-5.

n_photon =4.11e8 m^-3.

c=3e8 m/s.

tau=4.3e17 s.

So,

2 pi alpha^2 =6.2832 *5.318e-5 = let's compute this.

6.2832 *5.318e-5 = approximately 6.2832 * 5.318e-5 ≈ (6.2832 *5.318 )e-5.

Compute 6.2832 *5.318 ≈ 6*5=30, but more accurately:

5 *6=30, 0.318 *6=1.908, 5.318 *0.2832≈(5 *0.2832=1.416) + (0.318 *0.2832≈0.09) → ≈1.506.

So total approx 30 +1.908 +1.506 = 33.414.

So, 33.414e-5 =3.3414e-4.

Multiply by n_photon:

3.3414e-4 *4.11e8 = 3.3414e-4 *4.11e8 = (3.3414 *4.11 )e( -4 +8 ) → 3.3414*4.11 ≈ 13.72 → 13.72e4 =1.372e5.

Multiply by c (3e8 m/s):

1.372e5 *3e8 = 4.116e13.

Multiply by tau (4.3e17 s):

4.116e13 *4.3e17 = (4.116 *4.3 )e(13+17) → 4.116*4.3≈17.7 → 17.7e30 =1.77e31.

Denominator:3e-3 eV.

E = numerator / denominator = (1.77e31 eV) / (3e-3) ) → 1.77e31 /3e-3 = (1.77/3 )e34 = 0.59e34 → 5.9e33 eV.

Wait, that's 5.9e33 eV, which is 5.9e24 TeV. That's way higher than the options given. The options are in the 1e5 GeV range, which is 1e5 * 1e9 eV = 1e14 eV. So, 5.9e33 eV is way off.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for the cross-section. Maybe the cross-section is different.

Wait, perhaps the cross-section formula I used is incorrect. Let me think again.

Another approach: the cross-section for pair production from two photons can be approximated as sigma ≈ (alpha^2 m_e^2)/(s), where s is the center-of-mass energy squared. So for s >> m_e^2, sigma ≈ (alpha^2 m_e^2)/s.

Wait, but earlier I thought s=4 E epsilon. So, sigma = (alpha^2 m_e^2 )/(4 E epsilon ).

So, then, Gamma = n_photon * sigma * c.

So,

Gamma = n_photon * (alpha^2 m_e^2 )/(4 E epsilon ) * c.

Thus, tau = 1/Gamma = (4 E epsilon )/( n_photon alpha^2 m_e^2 c )

Solve for E:

E = (tau n_photon alpha^2 m_e^2 c )/(4 epsilon )

Hmm, perhaps this is the correct formula.

Now, let's plug in the numbers with this formula.

Constants:

n_photon =4.11e8 m^-3.

alpha≈ 1/137 ≈0.007297.

m_e c^2 =0.511 MeV → m_e^2 c^4 = (0.511 MeV)^2 = (0.511e6 eV)^2 = (0.511e6)^2 eV^2 ≈ 2.61e11 eV^2.

Wait, but when substituting in SI units, perhaps it's better to convert everything into SI base units.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute in terms of eV and other units.

Alternatively, let's compute each part:

tau=4.3e17 sec.

epsilon=1e-3 eV.

n_photon=4.11e8 m^-3.

alpha=1/137.

m_e^2 c^2 = (0.511 MeV)^2 = 0.511^2 (1e6 eV)^2 = 0.261121e12 eV^2.

But I think I may have messed up the units somewhere. Let's compute step by step.

E = (tau * n_photon * alpha^2 * m_e^2 c^2 ) / (4 * epsilon )

Wait, but m_e^2 c^4 is (0.511 MeV)^2 = (0.511e6 eV)^2 = 0.511^2 * 1e12 eV^2 = approximately 0.261e12 eV^2 = 2.61e11 eV^2.

So,

E = (4.3e17 s * 4.11e8 m^-3 * (1/137)^2 * 2.61e11 eV^2 ) / (4 * 1e-3 eV )

Let me compute each part:

Compute numerator:

4.3e17 *4.11e8 = 4.3*4.11=17.673 → 17.673e25 = 1.7673e26.

(1/137)^2 ≈ 5.317e-5.

So, 5.317e-5 * 2.61e11 =5.317e-5 *2.61e11 = (5.317 *2.61 )e6 → approx 13.88e6 →1.388e7.

Multiply all together:

1.7673e26 * 1.388e7 ≈ 2.454e33.

Denominator:4 *1e-3 eV =4e-3 eV.

So,

E = 2.454e33 / (4e-3 eV ) = (2.454e33 ) / (4e-3 ) eV.

2.454e33 /4e-3 = (2.454/4 )e36 → approx 0.6135e36 → 6.135e35 eV.

That's even worse. So, perhaps this formula is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I missed a factor of c^2 somewhere. Because m_e^2 c^4 is (m_e c^2)^2, which is (0.511 MeV)^2, so 0.261 MeV².

Wait, perhaps I should express everything in terms of eV.

Let me try again.

So,

E = (tau * n_photon * alpha^2 * (m_e c^2)^2 ) / (4 * epsilon )

Now, substituting the values:

tau=4.3e17 s.

n_photon=4.11e8 m^-3.

alpha=1/137.

(m_e c^2 )^2 = (0.511e6 eV )^2 = (0.511)^2 * 1e12 eV² = 0.2611 eV² *1e12 = 2.611e11 eV².

epsilon=1e-3 eV.

So,

E = (4.3e17 *4.11e8 * (1/137)^2 *2.611e11 ) / (4 *1e-3 )

Compute numerator:

4.3e17 *4.11e8 = (4.3 *4.11 )e25 = 17.673e25 =1.7673e26.

(1/137)^2 ≈ 5.317e-5.

1.7673e26 *5.317e-5 = (1.7673 *5.317 )e21 → approx 9.4e21.

Multiply by 2.611e11 → 9.4e21 * 2.611e11 = 2.45e33.

Denominator:4e-3.

E = 2.45e33 /4e-3 = 6.125e35 eV.

Still, that's way too big. So I must have made a mistake in the approach. Perhaps I should try a different method.

Alternative approach:

The photon's lifetime is limited when the interaction rate becomes significant. Another way to look at this is using the concept of photon attenuation length. The attenuation length L is the distance over which the photon's intensity decreases by a factor of e. So, L = 1/(n_photon * sigma).

So, L = 1/(n_photon * sigma )

But since the gamma-ray is moving at speed c, the time it takes to travel a distance L is tau = L/(c) = 1/(n_photon sigma c )

Which brings us back to the same tau expression as before.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should use the optical depth tau Optical depth is defined as N = n * sigma * L, where L is the path length. So, when N ≈1, the photon has a 1/e chance of being absorbed. So, perhaps the condition is that the optical depth is about 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the lifetime tau is such that the photon loses energy on a timescale tau. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should find the energy E where the interaction rate causes the photon to lose energy quickly enough that its lifetime is limited. Maybe the condition is that the photon's lifetime is on the order of the age of the universe, so that it can't propagate further than a certain distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the energy where the photon's lifetime equals the age of the universe.

So, tau = 1/(n_photon sigma c )

But sigma = (alpha^2 m_e^2 )/(s ), where s=4 E epsilon.

So,

sigma = alpha^2 m_e^2 / (4 E epsilon )

So,

tau = (4 E epsilon )/(n_photon alpha^2 m_e^2 c )

Solving for E:

E = (tau n_photon alpha^2 m_e^2 c )/(4 epsilon )

Now, let's compute each term.

tau: age of universe ~ 4.3e17 seconds.

n_photon: 411 cm^-3 = 4.11e8 m^-3.

alpha^2 = (1/137)^2 ≈5.32e-5.

m_e^2: (0.511 MeV)^2 = (0.511e6 eV )^2 = 0.261e12 eV².

But wait, units are important here. Let's compute each term in eV and seconds.

c = 3e8 m/s.

epsilon=1e-3 eV.

So,

E = (4.3e17 s *4.11e8 m^-3 *5.32e-5 * 0.261e12 eV² *3e8 m/s ) / (4 *1e-3 eV )

Let me compute numerator step by step.

Compute 4.3e17 *4.11e8: 4.3e17 *4.11e8 = 17.673e25 =1.7673e26.

Multiply by 5.32e-5: 1.7673e26 *5.32e-5 = (1.7673 *5.32 )e21 → approx 9.4e21.

Multiply by 0.261e12 eV^2: 9.4e21 *0.261e12 = (9.4 *0.261 )e33 eV² → 2.453e33 eV².

Multiply by 3e8 m/s: 2.453e33 eV² *3e8 m/s =7.359e41 eV²·m/s.

Denominator:4 *1e-3 eV =4e-3 eV.

So,

E = (7.359e41 eV²·m/s ) / (4e-3 eV )

= (7.359e41 )/(4e-3 ) eV·m/s.

= 1.83975e44 eV·m/s.

Now, the units are eV·m/s. To get energy in eV, we need to ensure the units are correct. Wait, perhaps I messed up unit conversion somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the numerator and denominator in terms of eV and seconds.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute everything in terms of eV and seconds.

Wait, let's try another approach. Let's convert all terms into eV and seconds.

m_e c^2 is 0.511 MeV, which is 0.511e6 eV.

So,

m_e^2 c^4 = (0.511e6 eV )^2 = (0.511)^2 * 1e12 eV² = 0.261e12 eV².

Now, putting all together:

E = (tau * n_photon * alpha^2 * m_e^2 c^4 ) / (4 * epsilon * c )

Because, wait, the earlier formula was:

E = (tau * n_photon * alpha^2 * m_e^2 c^2 )/(4 epsilon )

Wait, perhaps I missed a c^2 factor. Let me rederive.

Wait, from the formula:

tau = (4 E epsilon )/(n_photon alpha^2 m_e^2 c )

Wait, perhaps I should have:

tau = (4 E epsilon )/(n_photon alpha^2 (m_e c^2)^2 )

Because the cross-section formula involves m_e^2 c^4, which is (m_e c^2 )^2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the cross-section formula. Let me think again.

The cross-section sigma for two photons creating an electron-positron pair is:

sigma = (alpha^2 / (4 E epsilon )) * (m_e^2 c^4 ) / (s ) ), but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should refer to the standard formula for photon-photon cross-section.

Upon reflection, I recall that the cross-section for photon-photon annihilation into electron-positron pairs is given by:

sigma ≈ (8 π alpha^2 m_e^2)/(3 s ) * (1 + 2 m_e^2/s )

Where s is the center-of-mass energy squared. For high-energy photons where s >> m_e^2, this simplifies to sigma ≈ (8 π alpha^2 m_e^2)/(3 s )

But s =4 E epsilon, as we derived earlier. So,

sigma ≈ (8 π alpha^2 m_e^2 )/(3 *4 E epsilon ) ) = (2 pi alpha^2 m_e^2 )/(3 E epsilon )

Thus, the interaction rate Gamma = n_photon * sigma * c.

So,

Gamma = n_photon * (2 pi alpha^2 m_e^2 )/(3 E epsilon ) * c.

Thus, the lifetime tau = 1/Gamma = (3 E epsilon )/( 2 pi alpha^2 m_e^2 n_photon c )

Solving for E:

E = (tau * 2 pi alpha^2 m_e^2 n_photon c )/(3 epsilon )

Now, let's compute this with the numbers.

tau=4.3e17 s.

alpha=1/137≈0.007297.

m_e c^2=0.511e6 eV → m_e^2 c^4=(0.511e6 eV )^2=0.261e12 eV².

n_photon=4.11e8 m^-3.

c=3e8 m/s.

epsilon=1e-3 eV.

Calculate each term step by step.

First, compute numerator:

tau * 2 pi alpha^2 m_e^2 n_photon c.

Compute each part:

tau=4.3e17 s.

2 pi ≈6.283.

alpha^2≈5.32e-5.

m_e^2 c^4=0.261e12 eV².

n_photon=4.11e8 m^-3.

c=3e8 m/s.

Putting together:

4.3e17 *6.283 = (4.3 *6.283 )e17 ≈ 26.95e17 =2.695e18.

Multiply by alpha^2 (5.32e-5 ) →2.695e18 *5.32e-5 = (2.695 *5.32 )e13 → 14.33e13 =1.433e14.

Multiply by m_e^2 c^4 (0.261e12 eV² ) →1.433e14 *0.261e12 = (1.433*0.261 )e26 eV² → 0.374e26 =3.74e25 eV².

Multiply by n_photon (4.11e8 m^-3 ) →3.74e25 *4.11e8 = (3.74 *4.11 )e33 → approx 15.36e33 =1.536e34.

Multiply by c (3e8 m/s ) →1.536e34 *3e8 =4.608e42 eV²·m/s.

Denominator:3 * epsilon =3 *1e-3 eV =3e-3 eV.

So,

E = (4.608e42 eV²·m/s ) / (3e-3 eV ) ) = (4.608e42 )/(3e-3 ) eV·m/s.

= 1.536e45 eV·m/s.

But units don't make sense. To get energy in eV, I should have the units cancel properly. Wait, perhaps I missed a conversion factor involving c.

Wait, maybe I should have considered that when I include c, the units would be eV×m/s. But to get energy in eV, perhaps I should have multiplied by c and then divided by appropriate units.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to set the photon's lifetime equal to the age of the universe and then solve for E, but I'm getting stuck on the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should switch to natural units where c=1 and see if that helps.

But perhaps this is getting too convoluted. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I can use the formula for the photon's attenuation length.

The attenuation length L is given by L = 1/(n_photon sigma )

But in terms of energy, L = (4 E epsilon )/(n_photon alpha^2 m_e^2 )

Because sigma = (alpha^2 m_e^2 )/(4 E epsilon )

So,

L = 1/(n_photon * (alpha^2 m_e^2 )/(4 E epsilon )) ) = 4 E epsilon / (n_photon alpha^2 m_e^2 )

The time taken to travel this length is tau = L / c = (4 E epsilon )/(n_photon alpha^2 m_e^2 c )

So,

tau = (4 E epsilon )/(n_photon alpha^2 m_e^2 c )

Solving for E:

E = (n_photon alpha^2 m_e^2 c tau )/(4 epsilon )

Now, plugging in the numbers:

n_photon=4.11e8 m^-3.

alpha=1/137.

m_e c^2=0.511e6 eV → m_e^2 c^4= (0.511e6 eV )^2 = 0.261e12 eV².

c=3e8 m/s.

tau=4.3e17 s.

epsilon=1e-3 eV.

So,

E = (4.11e8 * (1/137)^2 *0.261e12 *3e8 *4.3e17 )/(4 *1e-3 )

Compute numerator:

4.11e8 * (1/137)^2 =4.11e8 *5.32e-5 ≈ 4.11e8 *5.32e-5 = (4.11*5.32 )e3 → 21.8e3 =2.18e4.

Multiply by 0.261e12 → 2.18e4 *0.261e12 =5.69e15.

Multiply by 3e8 →5.69e15 *3e8=1.707e24.

Multiply by 4.3e17 →1.707e24 *4.3e17 =7.34e41.

Denominator:4 *1e-3 =4e-3.

So,

E=7.34e41 /4e-3 =1.835e44 eV.

Again, this is way too high. So I'm probably making a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the following formula for the critical energy E_c where the photon's lifetime is limited by this process:

E_c ≈ 1.5 ×10^5 GeV × (epsilon / (1e-3 eV))^{-1} × (n_photon / (1 cm^-3 ))^{-1} × (tau / (10^10 years ))^{-1}

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a standard result.

I recall that the critical energy where the photon-photon interaction becomes significant is around the so-called "pair production threshold." The threshold occurs when the center-of-mass energy is at least 2 m_e c^2, which is about 1.02 MeV. But this is just the threshold for pair production. However, the cross-section increases rapidly with energy beyond that.

Wait, but the problem is about the energy where the photon's lifetime is limited by this process. The options are all in the order of 1e5 GeV, which is 1e12 eV. That's way higher than 1 MeV, so it's well above the threshold.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the critical energy is:

E_c ≈ (4 m_e^2 c^4 )/(epsilon) * (n_photon c tau )/(sigma_0 )

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy E can be found using E ≈ ( (m_e c^2 )^2 )/(epsilon ) * (n_photon c tau )/(sigma_0 )

But I'm not getting anywhere.

Another approach: use the formula for the photon's lifetime due to pair production.

The lifetime tau is given by:

tau = (4 E epsilon )/(n_photon alpha^2 m_e^2 c )

So,

E = (tau n_photon alpha^2 m_e^2 c )/(4 epsilon )

Plugging in numbers:

tau=4.3e17 s.

n_photon=4.11e8 m^-3.

alpha=1/137.

m_e c^2=0.511e6 eV.

c=3e8 m/s.

epsilon=1e-3 eV.

So,

Compute numerator:

4.3e17 *4.11e8 =1.7673e26.

Multiply by alpha^2 (5.32e-5) →1.7673e26 *5.32e-5 =9.4e21.

Multiply by (m_e c^2)^2 (0.511e6 eV)^2 →0.511e6=5.11e5 eV. So (5.11e5)^2=2.61e11 eV².

So, 9.4e21 *2.61e11 =2.45e33.

Multiply by c (3e8 m/s ) →2.45e33 *3e8 =7.35e41.

Denominator:4 *1e-3 eV=4e-3 eV.

So,

E=7.35e41 /4e-3 →1.8375e44 eV.

Again, way too high. So perhaps I have a fundamental mistake in the formula.

Alternative Idea: Perhaps I should consider the photon's energy in the rest frame of the CMB photon.

Wait, perhaps that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is E_c ~ (m_e c^2 )^2/(epsilon), multiplied by some factors involving the density and time.

Wait, but perhaps I should go back to the cross-section formula.

The cross-section sigma ≈ (8 pi alpha^2)/(3 s ), where s=4 E epsilon.

So,

sigma = (8 pi alpha^2 )/(3 *4 E epsilon ) ) = (2 pi alpha^2 )/(3 E epsilon )

So,

Gamma = n_photon * sigma * c = n_photon * (2 pi alpha^2 )/(3 E epsilon ) * c.

Thus,

tau = 1/(Gamma ) = (3 E epsilon )/( 2 pi alpha^2 n_photon c )

So,

E = (tau * 2 pi alpha^2 n_photon c )/(3 epsilon )

Plugging in the numbers:

tau=4.3e17 s.

2 pi ≈6.283.

alpha=1/137.

n_photon=4.11e8 m^-3.

c=3e8 m/s.

epsilon=1e-3 eV.

Compute numerator:

4.3e17 *6.283 = approx 2.695e18.

Multiply by alpha^2 (5.32e-5 ) →2.695e18 *5.32e-5 = approx1.433e14.

Multiply by n_photon (4.11e8 ) →1.433e14 *4.11e8 =5.91e22.

Multiply by c (3e8 ) →5.91e22 *3e8 =1.773e31.

Denominator:3 *1e-3 =3e-3.

So,

E =1.773e31 /3e-3 →5.91e33 eV.

Which is 5.91e33 eV, which is 5.91e24 TeV, way higher than the options given.

So, I'm stuck. None of the calculations are getting me anywhere near the options. I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should instead consider that the photon's lifetime is limited when the photon's energy loss rate is significant. But I'm not sure.

Another Idea: The photon's lifetime is determined by the probability of interaction per unit length. So, the mean free path is L=1/(n_photon sigma ), and the time is L/c =1/(n_photon sigma c ), which is the same as before.

But perhaps the cross-section formula is different. I think I might have the cross-section wrong. Let me look up the correct formula for the photon-photon cross-section for pair production.

Upon consulting my memory, the cross-section for photon-photon annihilation into e+ e- is given by:

sigma = (8 π alpha^2 m_e^2)/(3 s) * (1 + (2 m_e^2)/s )

Where s is the center-of-mass energy squared. For s >> 2 m_e^2, this simplifies to sigma ≈ (8 π alpha^2 m_e^2 )/(3 s )

And s=4 E epsilon.

So, sigma = (8 π alpha^2 m_e^2 )/(3 *4 E epsilon ) ) = (2 π alpha^2 m_e^2 )/(3 E epsilon )

So, Gamma = n_photon * sigma * c = n_photon * (2 π alpha^2 m_e^2 c )/(3 E epsilon )

Tau = 1/Gamma = 3 E epsilon / (2 π alpha^2 m_e^2 n_photon c )

So,

E = (tau * 2 π alpha^2 m_e^2 n_photon c )/(3 epsilon )

Now, substituting the numbers.

Compute numerator:

tau=4.3e17 s.

2 π ≈6.283.

alpha^2≈5.32e-5.

m_e^2 c^4= (0.511e6 eV )^2= 0.261e12 eV².

n_photon=4.11e8 m^-3.

c=3e8 m/s.

epsilon=1e-3 eV.

Compute numerator step by step.

tau *2 pi =4.3e17 *6.283≈2.7e18.

Multiply by alpha^2 (5.32e-5 ) →2.7e18 *5.32e-5 =1.436e14.

Multiply by m_e^2 c^4 (0.261e12 eV² ) →1.436e14 *0.261e12 =3.74e25 eV².

Multiply by n_photon (4.11e8 m^-3 ) →3.74e25 *4.11e8 =1.536e34.

Multiply by c (3e8 m/s ) →1.536e34 *3e8 =4.608e42 eV²·m/s.

Denominator:3 *epsilon =3e-3 eV.

So,

E =4.608e42 eV²·m/s / (3e-3 eV ) = (4.608e42 )/(3e-3 ) eV·m/s.

=1.536e45 eV·m/s.

Wait, but this still doesn't give me an energy in eV. I'm missing a unit conversion. Perhaps I should convert the units.

Wait, 1 eV·m/s is not a standard unit. Let me think in terms of eV and s.

Wait, perhaps I should have included the speed of light in the cross-section formula. Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered that the cross-section is in cm² or m².

Wait, perhaps I should convert sigma from m² to cm², but this might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor of c in the cross-section formula. For example, the cross-section might have a factor of c^2 in the denominator.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is sigma = (8 pi alpha^2 m_e^2 )/(3 s c^2 )

But then s=4 E epsilon c^2.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula includes c^2 in s. So, s= (E1 + E2 )^2 - (p1 c + p2 c )^2.

Wait, no, earlier derivation of s=4 E epsilon is correct because for photons moving in opposite directions, s=4 E epsilon.

Wait, maybe I'm getting stuck and should look for an alternative approach. Let me try to find the answer using the options.

Looking at the options:

A) 9.5e4 GeV = 9.5e4 *1e9 eV =9.5e13 eV.

B)1.8e5 GeV=1.8e5 *1e9=1.8e14 eV.

C)2.6e5 GeV=2.6e14 eV.

D)3.9e5 GeV=3.9e14 eV.

So, the options are all ~1e14 eV.

Let me try to compute E using a simplified formula.

Assume that E is about 1e14 eV.

Then,

s=4 E epsilon =4 *1e14 eV *1e-3 eV =4e11 (eV)^2.

Which is about 4e11 eV².

Now, compute sigma = (8 pi alpha^2 m_e^2 )/(3 s )

m_e^2 = (0.511e6 eV )^2 = 2.61e11 eV².

So,

sigma = (8 pi (1/137)^2 * 2.61e11 )/(3 *4e11 )

Compute numerator:

8 pi ≈25.1327.

(1/137)^2≈5.32e-5.

25.1327 *5.32e-5 ≈0.001339.

0.001339 *2.61e11 ≈3.49e8.

Denominator:3 *4e11=1.2e12.

So,

sigma≈3.49e8 /1.2e12 ≈2.91e-4 cm².

Wait, because cross-section is usually in cm². So 2.91e-4 cm² is 2.91e-4 *1e-4 m² =2.91e-8 m².

Now, compute Gamma =n_photon * sigma * c.

n_photon=4.11e8 m^-3.

sigma=2.91e-8 m².

c=3e8 m/s.

Gamma=4.11e8 *2.91e-8 *3e8 = (4.11e8 *2.91e-8 )= 4.11 *2.91 ≈11.95 →11.95 *3e8 →3.585e9 per second.

So, Gamma≈3.58e9 s^-1.

Thus, tau=1/Gamma≈2.8e-10 seconds.

Which is way shorter than the age of the universe. So for E=1e14 eV, the lifetime is only about 2.8e-10 seconds, which is way too short.

But the options are higher, so perhaps I should try a higher energy.

Wait, but the problem is that when I compute for E=1e14 eV, I get a much shorter lifetime than the age of the universe. So perhaps the correct E is lower. Let me try E=1e12 eV (1 TeV).

s=4 *1e12 eV *1e-3 eV =4e9 eV².

sigma =8 pi (1/137)^2 *2.61e11 / (3 *4e9 )

8 pi≈25.1327.

(1/137)^2≈5.32e-5.

25.1327 *5.32e-5≈0.001339.

0.001339 *2.61e11≈3.49e8.

Denominator=12e9.

sigma=3.49e8 /1.2e10 ≈2.91e-2 cm² =2.91e-6 m².

Gamma=4.11e8 *2.91e-6 *3e8 =4.11e8 *2.91e-6= 1194 *3e8= 3.58e11 s^-1.

Tau=1/3.58e11≈2.8e-12 seconds.

Still way too short.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to find E such that the lifetime is about the age of the universe (tau=4.3e17 s).

Let me set up the equation:

tau = (4 E epsilon )/(n_photon alpha^2 m_e^2 c )

Solve for E:

E = (tau n_photon alpha^2 m_e^2 c )/(4 epsilon )

Plugging in the numbers.

tau=4.3e17 s.

n_photon=4.11e8 m^-3.

alpha=1/137.

m_e^2 c^4= (0.511e6 eV )^2=2.61e11 eV².

c=3e8 m/s.

epsilon=1e-3 eV.

Compute numerator:

4.3e17 *4.11e8 =1.7673e26.

Multiply by alpha^2 (5.32e-5 ) →1.7673e26 *5.32e-5=9.4e21.

Multiply by m_e^2 c^4 (2.61e11 eV² ) →9.4e21 *2.61e11=2.45e33 eV².

Multiply by c (3e8 m/s ) →2.45e33 *3e8=7.35e41 eV²·m/s.

Denominator:4 *1e-3 eV=4e-3 eV.

So,

E=7.35e41 eV²·m/s /4e-3 eV =1.8375e44 eV·m/s.

Wait, but this still doesn't make sense. I must be making a mistake in the units.

Wait, perhaps I should avoid unit conversion and use natural units where c=1, but that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to note that the gamma-ray energy must be around the Compton energy of the CMB photon.

The Compton energy is E_cm= (epsilon * m_e c^2 )/(m_e c^2 + epsilon ) )≈ (epsilon * m_e c^2 )/(m_e c^2 ) )=epsilon.

Wait, no, that's not helpful.

Another Idea: Perhaps the energy E should be such that the product E * epsilon is on the order of (m_e c^2 )^2.

So, E * epsilon ≈ (m_e c^2 )^2.

m_e c^2=0.511 MeV=5.11e5 eV.

So,

E ≈ (5.11e5 eV )^2 / epsilon.

epsilon=1e-3 eV.

So,

E≈ (2.61e11 eV² ) / (1e-3 eV )=2.61e14 eV=2.61e14 eV=261e12 eV=261 TeV.

Wait, but 2.6e14 eV is 2.6e5 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 2.6e5 GeV.

So, perhaps the answer is C) 2.6e5 GeV.

Wait, this approach gives E ≈2.6e5 GeV, which matches option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the energy of high-energy gamma-rays whose lifetimes in the universe are limited by their annihilation with CMB photons via the process $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$. The key is to calculate the energy $E$ at which the interaction rate becomes significant, such that the photon's lifetime $\tau$ is limited by this process.

The interaction rate $\Gamma$ is proportional to the cross-section $\sigma$ and the number density of CMB photons $n_{\text{photon}}$. The cross-section for $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$ is given by:

\[
\sigma \approx \frac{8\pi \alpha^2 m_e^2}{3s}, \quad s = 4E\epsilon,
\]

where $\alpha \approx 1/137$ is the fine-structure constant, $m_e$ is the electron mass, $E$ is the gamma-ray energy, and $\epsilon \approx 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$ is the average energy of CMB photons. Substituting $s = 4E\epsilon$, the cross-section becomes:

\[
\sigma \approx \frac{2\pi \alpha^2 m_e^2}{3E\epsilon}.
\]

The interaction rate is then:

\[
\Gamma = n_{\text{photon}} \sigma c = n_{\text{photon}} \frac{2\pi \alpha^2 m_e^2 c}{3E\epsilon}.
\]

The lifetime $\tau$ is the inverse of the interaction rate:

\[
\tau = \frac{1}{\Gamma} = \frac{3E\epsilon}{2\pi \alpha^2 n_{\text{photon}} m_e^2 c}.
\]

Rearranging for $E$:

\[
E = \frac{\tau \cdot 2\pi \alpha^2 n_{\text{photon}} m_e^2 c}{3\epsilon}.
\]

Substituting the constants:
- $\tau \approx 4.3 \times 10^{17} \, \text{s}$ (age of the universe),
- $n_{\text{photon}} \approx 4.11 \times 10^8 \, \text{m}^{-3}$,
- $\alpha \approx 1/137$,
- $m_e^2 c^4 \approx (0.511 \, \text{MeV})^2 = 2.61 \times 10^{11} \, \text{eV}^2$,
- $c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}$,
- $\epsilon = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$,

the numerator becomes:

\[
\tau \cdot 2\pi \alpha^2 n_{\text{photon}} m_e^2 c \approx 4.3 \times 10^{17} \cdot 6.283 \cdot 5.32 \times 10^{-5} \cdot 4.11 \times 10^8 \cdot 2.61 \times 10^{11} \cdot 3 \times 10^8,
\]

which evaluates to approximately $7.35 \times 10^{41} \, \text{eV}^2 \cdot \text{m/s}$. The denominator is $3 \cdot 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$. Thus:

\[
E \approx \frac{7.35 \times 10^{41}}{3 \times 10^{-3}} \, \text{eV} \approx 2.45 \times 10^{44} \, \text{eV}.
\]

However, this result is inconsistent with the provided options, suggesting a miscalculation in unit handling or constants. Instead, using a simpler scaling argument, the energy $E$ is determined by requiring $E \cdot \epsilon \approx (m_e c^2)^2$, leading to:

\[
E \approx \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{\epsilon} = \frac{(0.511 \, \text{MeV})^2}{10^{-3} \, \text{eV}} = \frac{(0.511 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV})^2}{10^{-3} \, \text{eV}} = 2.61 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV} = 2.61 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

This matches option **C**. Therefore, the energy at which the gamma-ray's lifetime is limited by the $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$ process is approximately **2.6 × 10⁵ GeV**.

Answer: C

Okay, so I have this physics problem here about gamma-ray annihilation with the CMB photons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is asking for the energy at which a gamma-ray's lifetime in the universe is limited by the process gamma-gamma -> e+ e-. So, this is about the interaction of high-energy gamma-rays with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation. I remember that when a high-energy photon interacts with a low-energy photon, like a CMB photon, they can annihilate into electron-positron pairs if the energy is sufficient.

Wait, so photons are all around, especially the CMB. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. So, the gamma-ray is high energy, and the CMB photon is low energy.

I think the process is called the photon-photon interaction, and the cross-section for this process rises when the center-of-mass energy is above a certain threshold. The threshold for electron-positron pair production is when the combined energy is at least twice the rest mass of an electron, which is about 1.02 MeV. But wait, the CMB photons are really low energy, so maybe that's not the main factor here.

Wait, no, I think the cross-section for this annihilation process depends on the energy of the gamma-ray relative to the CMB photon. The problem is about the photon's lifetime being limited by this process, which means that the gamma-ray would lose energy quickly through such interactions, limiting how far it can travel or how long it can exist.

So, the photon's mean lifetime due to this process would be determined by the interaction rate. The interaction rate depends on the cross-section and the number density of the CMB photons.

The cross-section for photon-photon annihilation into electron-positron pairs is known, I think it's given by some formula. I remember that for high-energy photons, the cross-section increases as the energy increases. At energies where the center-of-mass energy is much larger than the electron mass, the cross-section is given by the so-called "Bethe-Heitler" formula or maybe the "Dokshitzer" formula. But I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, the cross-section sigma for gamma gamma -> e+ e- is approximately sigma ~ (8π/3) * (α^2 / (s)) * (4m_e^2 + s), where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy. Or perhaps another form. Alternatively, for s >> m_e^2, it simplifies to sigma ≈ (8π/3) * (α^2 / s). Because when s is much larger than m_e squared, the 4m_e^2 term becomes negligible.

So, the cross-section sigma is inversely proportional to s, where s is (E1 + E2)^2 or something like that? Wait, no, the center of mass energy squared is s=(E1+E2)^2 - (p1c + p2c)^2. But since the CMB photons are moving in all directions, but for a gamma-ray moving in one direction, the energies add in the center-of-momentum frame. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the center-of-mass energy.

Alternatively, considering that the CMB has a thermal spectrum, but the average energy is given as 1e-3 eV. So the typical CMB photon energy is E_cm ~ 1e-3 eV. The gamma-ray has energy E. So the center-of-mass energy squared would be s = (E + E_cm)^2. But wait, actually, the correct expression for the center-of-mass energy when two photons are colliding head-on is s = (E_gamma + E_CMB)^2 - (pc)^2. But photons have E = pc, so for a gamma-ray and a CMB photon moving in opposite directions, the actual calculation is a bit more involved.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to model the scenario where the gamma-ray is moving with energy E, and the CMB photon is a low-energy photon with energy epsilon (1e-3 eV). So, for a head-on collision, the center-of-mass energy squared s is (E + epsilon)^2 - (E - epsilon)^2 (since the momenta are opposite). Wait, no, let me think: if the gamma-ray is moving in the +x direction with energy E, and the CMB photon is moving in the -x direction with energy epsilon, then their momenta are E/(c) in opposite directions.

Wait, but photons have momentum p = E/(c). So for the gamma-ray, p_gamma = E/(c), and for the CMB photon, p_CMB = epsilon/(c) in the opposite direction.

So the total energy in the center of mass frame would be E_gamma + E_CMB (since both are energy), and the momentum vectors would sum to (p_gamma - p_CMB) (since they are opposite). Wait, no, the magnitude would be (p_gamma + p_CMB) if they're moving towards each other. Hmm, perhaps I should just calculate s.

s is the Mandelstam variable s, which is (p1 + p2)^2, where p1 and p2 are the four-momenta of the two photons. So, for photons moving in opposite directions, s would be:

s = (E1 + E2)^2 - ( (p1 c) - (p2 c) )^2.

But since E1 = p1 c and E2 = p2 c, because photons have E=pc. So, s becomes (E1 + E2)^2 - ( (E1 - E2) )^2.

Expanding that: (E1^2 + 2 E1 E2 + E2^2) - (E1^2 - 2 E1 E2 + E2^2) ) = 4 E1 E2.

So s = 4 E1 E2.

Oh, that's a useful result. So the center-of-mass energy squared is four times the product of the two photon energies.

So, in our case, E1 is the gamma-ray energy (E), E2 is the CMB photon energy (epsilon ~ 1e-3 eV). So s=4 E epsilon.

Wait, but the cross-section depends on s. Earlier I thought the cross-section sigma is proportional to 1/s, but for high energies, maybe there's another dependence.

Hmm, the cross-section for pair production is given by sigma = (8 pi/3) (alpha^2 m_e^2) / (s) * (4 m_e^2 + s), but for high energies where s >> m_e^2, this reduces to sigma ≈ (8 pi/3 alpha^2 m_e^2) / s.

Wait, no, let me double-check. The formula for the cross-section when s >> 4 m_e^2 is sigma ≈ (8 pi/3) (alpha^2 / (s)) ) * ( (s + 4 m_e^2 ) ), but when s is much larger than m_e^2, the 4 m_e^2 can be neglected, so sigma ≈ (8 pi/3) (alpha^2 / s) * s? Wait, that can't be right because that would make sigma proportional to 8 pi/3 alpha^2, but that doesn't depend on s. Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong.

Wait, no, I think the correct formula for the cross-section when s is much larger than m_e^2 is sigma ≈ (8 pi/3) (alpha^2) * (m_e^2 / s). Wait, but that would mean sigma decreases as s increases, which makes sense because higher energies lead to lower cross-sections. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the cross-section has a different dependence.

Wait, another approach: the photon-photon cross-section for pair production is given by:

sigma = ( (8 π α²) / (3 s) ) * (1 + (2 m_e²)/s ) )

So when s is much larger than 2 m_e², the second term is negligible, and sigma ≈ (8 π α²) / (3 s).

But wait, I'm not confident about this. Maybe I should look it up in my memory. Oh, I remember that the cross-section for photon-photon annihilation into pairs is sigma = ( (8 π α²)/(3 s) ) * (1 + 2 (m_e c²)^2 / (s c^4) ) ) * c^4 ?

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing units here. Let me think in terms of energy units. Let's say that s is in energy squared units. So, m_e c² is about 0.511 MeV.

So, sigma ≈ (8 π α²)/(3 s) ) * (1 + 2 (m_e² c^4)/(s c^4) )) ), but I'm getting tangled in the units. Maybe it's better to write in terms of s being in (energy)^2.

Alternatively, perhaps the cross-section is sigma ≈ (8 π α²)/(3 s), which for high energies, s is large, so the cross-section is small.

But the problem is about the interaction rate. So the interaction rate (gamma per unit time) depends on the cross-section multiplied by the number density of the target photons.

So, the number density of CMB photons can be found from the CMB photon density. The CMB has a temperature T, and the photon number density is (for a photon gas) given by n_photon = (g_{3/2}(4/π) k_B^3 T^3) ) / (h^3), but perhaps more accurately, the number density u is given by u = a T^3, where a is the radiation constant. But perhaps for order of magnitude, I can use a known value.

Wait, the CMB temperature is about 2.7 K, so T ≈ 2.7 K. The number density of CMB photons is about n ~ 411 photons/cm³. Let me see, I remember that the number density of CMB photons is roughly 411 cm^-3, which is 4.11e+07 m^-3 (since 1 cm³ is 1e-6 m³, so 411 / 1e-6 m³ = 4.11e6 m^-3? Wait, wait, no: 1 cm³ = 1e-6 m³. So 411 photons/cm³ is 411 per 1e-6 m³, which is 411e6 m^-3, so 4.11e8 m^-3. Hmm, maybe I should check that number.

Alternatively, I can calculate it using the formula for the number density of photons in a blackbody spectrum at temperature T:

n_photon ≈ (g_{3/2}(ζ(3)) ) * ( (8 π k_B^3) / (h^3 c^3) ) ) * T^3 )

But maybe I can just use a standard value. I think the number density of CMB photons is approximately 411 cm^-3, which is 4.11e8 m^-3.

So, putting that together, the interaction rate per gamma-ray is Gamma = n_photon * sigma * v, where v is the velocity of the gamma-ray. But since gamma-rays are massless, v = c.

Wait, but wait, the cross-section formula is for the process, but the interaction rate would be Gamma = n_photon * sigma * c. Because the proper way to compute the interaction rate is n * sigma * v, where v is the relative velocity. But since the gamma and CMB photons are moving in opposite directions, their relative speed is 2c, but for the purpose of cross-section per unit volume, perhaps the speed is considered as c. I'm a bit confused here, but perhaps it's better to model it as the typical rate.

Wait, no, the rate is usually given by Gamma = n * sigma * v_rel, where v_rel is the relative velocity. For head-on collisions, the relative velocity is 2c, but since in reality, the CMB photons are in all directions, the average might be higher. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model it as the cross-section multiplied by the number density, multiplied by the velocity of the gamma-ray. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, the interaction rate is given by Gamma = n_photon * sigma * c, because the gamma is moving at speed c, and the cross-section is per unit volume.

But regardless, the lifetime of the gamma-ray would be the inverse of the interaction rate: tau = 1/Gamma = 1/(n_photon * sigma * c).

Wait, no, because Gamma is the rate of interaction events per unit time, so tau would be 1/Gamma.

So, let's model the lifetime as tau = 1/(n_photon * sigma * c).

The problem states that the gamma-ray's lifetime is limited by this process, meaning that the gamma-ray can't travel farther than about c * tau, and this must be less than the age of the universe or something, but perhaps the question is just asking for the energy where the interaction rate becomes significant, so that the lifetime is shorter than a certain value.

Alternatively, perhaps the condition is that the photon's lifetime due to this process is equal to the age of the universe, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the energy where the interaction rate becomes so high that the gamma-ray would lose energy quickly.

But perhaps the problem is to find the energy E such that the cross-section multiplied by the number density and the photon speed gives a lifetime that is a certain value. Like, when the lifetime equals the age of the universe, beyond that energy, the photon can't exist, so the energy where the lifetime is comparable to the age of the universe.

Wait, but the problem says "their lifetimes in the universe would be limited by this process." So, the gamma-ray's lifetime is determined by this interaction, so we need to find E such that the lifetime is the age of the universe, perhaps.

Wait, but the age of the universe is about 13.8 billion years, which is roughly 4.3e17 seconds. So, let's say the lifetime tau is about 1e17 seconds. So, for the gamma-ray to have its lifetime limited by this process, tau should be around that.

So, let's write the formula for tau.

tau = 1/(n_photon * sigma * c)

But sigma is (8 π α²)/(3 s) ) for high energies, where s=4 E epsilon.

Wait, so s=4 E epsilon.

Therefore, sigma = (8 π α²)/(3 * 4 E epsilon) ) = (2 π α^2)/(3 E epsilon).

So, substituting into tau:

tau = 1/(n_photon * (2 π α^2/(3 E epsilon)) * c )

= (3 E epsilon) / ( 2 π α^2 n_photon c )

Now, solving for E:

E = (tau * 2 π α^2 n_photon c ) / (3 epsilon )

But wait, we can rearrange to solve for E:

E = (tau * 2 π α^2 n_photon c ) / (3 epsilon )

So, E is proportional to tau/(epsilon).

Wait, but we can substitute the numbers.

Let me collect all the constants and plug them in.

Constants:

n_photon = 411 cm^-3 = 4.11e8 m^-3.

alpha is the fine-structure constant, approximately 1/137 ≈ 0.007297.

epsilon is the average CMB photon energy, 1e-3 eV = 1e-3 eV.

c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s.

Tau is the age of the universe, approx 4.3e17 seconds.

So, let's compute numerator and denominator.

Compute numerator: 2 π α^2 n_photon c tau.

So, let's compute each term:

alpha ≈ 1/137 ≈ 0.007297.

alpha^2 ≈ (0.007297)^2 ≈ 5.32e-5.

n_photon = 4.11e8 m^-3.

c=3e8 m/s.

tau=4.3e17 s.

epsilon=1e-3 eV.

So,

Numerator: 2 * pi * (5.32e-5) * (4.11e8) * (3e8) * (4.3e17 )

Denominator: 3 * (1e-3 eV)

Wait, but let's compute numerator:

2 * pi ≈ 6.2832.

6.2832 * 5.32e-5 ≈ 3.34e-4.

3.34e-4 * 4.11e8 ≈ (3.34 * 4.11) )e4 ≈ 13.73e4 = 1.373e5.

1.373e5 * 3e8 ≈ 4.119e13.

4.119e13 * 4.3e17 = 4.119e13 *4.3e17 = (4.119 *4.3) )e30 ≈ 17.7e30 = 1.77e31.

So numerator is 1.77e31.

Denominator: 3 * 1e-3 eV = 3e-3 eV.

So,

E = (1.77e31) / (3e-3 eV) ) = (1.77e31) / (3e-3) ) eV.

1.77e31 / 3e-3 = (1.77/3 )e34 = 0.59e34 = 5.9e33 eV.

Wait, 5.9e33 eV is a huge energy. But looking at the options, the highest is D) 3.9e5 GeV. Wait, 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, so 5.9e33 eV is 5.9e24 GeV. That's way higher than any of the options. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation. Let me try again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the expression for tau. Let me double-check.

Earlier, I had:

tau = (3 E epsilon) / ( 2 pi alpha^2 n_photon c )

So, solving for E:

E = (tau * 2 pi alpha^2 n_photon c ) / (3 epsilon )

Wait, but wait, I think I might have missed a factor. Let's re-derive tau.

The interaction rate is Gamma = n_photon * sigma * c.

So, tau = 1/Gamma = 1/(n_photon sigma c )

But sigma = (8 pi alpha^2)/(3 s ), and s=4 E epsilon.

So, sigma = (8 pi alpha^2 )/(3 * 4 E epsilon ) = (2 pi alpha^2 )/(3 E epsilon )

So,

Gamma = n_photon * (2 pi alpha^2)/(3 E epsilon ) * c.

So,

tau = 1/(Gamma) = 3 E epsilon / ( 2 pi alpha^2 n_photon c )

So,

E = (tau * 2 pi alpha^2 n_photon c )/(3 epsilon )

Wait, I think I have the right expression now.

So, let's compute the values again.

Compute numerator: 2 pi alpha^2 n_photon c tau.

Compute each part:

2 pi ≈ 6.283.

alpha^2 ≈ (1/137)^2 ≈ 5.32e-5.

n_photon = 4.11e8 m^-3.

c = 3e8 m/s.

tau = 4.3e17 s.

Multiply all together:

6.283 * 5.32e-5 = approx 6.283 * 5.32e-5 ≈ 3.34e-4.

3.34e-4 * 4.11e8 = approx 3.34e-4 *4.11e8 = (3.34 *4.11) )e( -4 +8 ) = 13.73e4 = 1.373e5.

1.373e5 * 3e8 = 4.119e13.

4.119e13 *4.3e17 = (4.119 *4.3 )e30 ≈ 17.7e30 = 1.77e31.

Denominator: 3 * epsilon = 3 * 1e-3 eV = 3e-3 eV.

So,

E = (1.77e31) / (3e-3 eV ) = (1.77e31) / (3e-3 ) eV.

So 1.77e31 / 3e-3 = (1.77 /3 )e34 = 0.59e34 = 5.9e33 eV.

Wait, that's 5.9e33 eV, which is 5.9e24 TeV, which is way beyond what the options suggest. The options are all around 1e5 GeV, which is 1e14 eV. So, I must have made a mistake.

Hmm, perhaps I messed up the calculation somewhere. Let me check the exponents.

Wait, 4.11e8 m^-3 is correct.

Wait, let's re-calculate the numerator step by step.

Compute 2 * pi = 6.2832.

alpha^2 = (1/137)^2 ≈ 5.318e-5.

n_photon =4.11e8 m^-3.

c=3e8 m/s.

tau=4.3e17 s.

So,

2 pi alpha^2 =6.2832 *5.318e-5 = let's compute this.

6.2832 *5.318e-5 = approximately 6.2832 * 5.318e-5 ≈ (6.2832 *5.318 )e-5.

Compute 6.2832 *5.318 ≈ 6*5=30, but more accurately:

5 *6=30, 0.318 *6=1.908, 5.318 *0.2832≈(5 *0.2832=1.416) + (0.318 *0.2832≈0.09) → ≈1.506.

So total approx 30 +1.908 +1.506 = 33.414.

So, 33.414e-5 =3.3414e-4.

Multiply by n_photon:

3.3414e-4 *4.11e8 = 3.3414e-4 *4.11e8 = (3.3414 *4.11 )e( -4 +8 ) → 3.3414*4.11 ≈ 13.72 → 13.72e4 =1.372e5.

Multiply by c (3e8 m/s):

1.372e5 *3e8 = 4.116e13.

Multiply by tau (4.3e17 s):

4.116e13 *4.3e17 = (4.116 *4.3 )e(13+17) → 4.116*4.3≈17.7 → 17.7e30 =1.77e31.

Denominator:3e-3 eV.

E = numerator / denominator = (1.77e31 eV) / (3e-3) ) → 1.77e31 /3e-3 = (1.77/3 )e34 = 0.59e34 → 5.9e33 eV.

Wait, that's 5.9e33 eV, which is 5.9e24 TeV. That's way higher than the options given. The options are in the 1e5 GeV range, which is 1e5 * 1e9 eV = 1e14 eV. So, 5.9e33 eV is way off.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for the cross-section. Maybe the cross-section is different.

Wait, perhaps the cross-section formula I used is incorrect. Let me think again.

Another approach: the cross-section for pair production from two photons can be approximated as sigma ≈ (alpha^2 m_e^2)/(s), where s is the center-of-mass energy squared. So for s >> m_e^2, sigma ≈ (alpha^2 m_e^2)/s.

Wait, but earlier I thought s=4 E epsilon. So, sigma = (alpha^2 m_e^2 )/(4 E epsilon ).

So, then, Gamma = n_photon * sigma * c.

So,

Gamma = n_photon * (alpha^2 m_e^2 )/(4 E epsilon ) * c.

Thus, tau = 1/Gamma = (4 E epsilon )/( n_photon alpha^2 m_e^2 c )

Solve for E:

E = (tau n_photon alpha^2 m_e^2 c )/(4 epsilon )

Hmm, perhaps this is the correct formula.

Now, let's plug in the numbers with this formula.

Constants:

n_photon =4.11e8 m^-3.

alpha≈ 1/137 ≈0.007297.

m_e c^2 =0.511 MeV → m_e^2 c^4 = (0.511 MeV)^2 = (0.511e6 eV)^2 = (0.511e6)^2 eV^2 ≈ 2.61e11 eV^2.

Wait, but when substituting in SI units, perhaps it's better to convert everything into SI base units.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute in terms of eV and other units.

Alternatively, let's compute each part:

tau=4.3e17 sec.

epsilon=1e-3 eV.

n_photon=4.11e8 m^-3.

alpha=1/137.

m_e^2 c^2 = (0.511 MeV)^2 = 0.511^2 (1e6 eV)^2 = 0.261121e12 eV^2.

But I think I may have messed up the units somewhere. Let's compute step by step.

E = (tau * n_photon * alpha^2 * m_e^2 c^2 ) / (4 * epsilon )

Wait, but m_e^2 c^4 is (0.511 MeV)^2 = (0.511e6 eV)^2 = 0.511^2 * 1e12 eV^2 = approximately 0.261e12 eV^2 = 2.61e11 eV^2.

So,

E = (4.3e17 s * 4.11e8 m^-3 * (1/137)^2 * 2.61e11 eV^2 ) / (4 * 1e-3 eV )

Let me compute each part:

Compute numerator:

4.3e17 *4.11e8 = 4.3*4.11=17.673 → 17.673e25 = 1.7673e26.

(1/137)^2 ≈ 5.317e-5.

So, 5.317e-5 * 2.61e11 =5.317e-5 *2.61e11 = (5.317 *2.61 )e6 → approx 13.88e6 →1.388e7.

Multiply all together:

1.7673e26 * 1.388e7 ≈ 2.454e33.

Denominator:4 *1e-3 eV =4e-3 eV.

So,

E = 2.454e33 / (4e-3 eV ) = (2.454e33 ) / (4e-3 ) eV.

2.454e33 /4e-3 = (2.454/4 )e36 → approx 0.6135e36 → 6.135e35 eV.

That's even worse. So, perhaps this formula is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I missed a factor of c^2 somewhere. Because m_e^2 c^4 is (m_e c^2)^2, which is (0.511 MeV)^2, so 0.261 MeV².

Wait, perhaps I should express everything in terms of eV.

Let me try again.

So,

E = (tau * n_photon * alpha^2 * (m_e c^2)^2 ) / (4 * epsilon )

Now, substituting the values:

tau=4.3e17 s.

n_photon=4.11e8 m^-3.

alpha=1/137.

(m_e c^2 )^2 = (0.511e6 eV )^2 = (0.511)^2 * 1e12 eV² = 0.2611 eV² *1e12 = 2.611e11 eV².

epsilon=1e-3 eV.

So,

E = (4.3e17 *4.11e8 * (1/137)^2 *2.611e11 ) / (4 *1e-3 )

Compute numerator:

4.3e17 *4.11e8 = (4.3 *4.11 )e25 = 17.673e25 =1.7673e26.

(1/137)^2 ≈ 5.317e-5.

1.7673e26 *5.317e-5 = (1.7673 *5.317 )e21 → approx 9.4e21.

Multiply by 2.611e11 → 9.4e21 * 2.611e11 = 2.45e33.

Denominator:4e-3.

E = 2.45e33 /4e-3 = 6.125e35 eV.

Still, that's way too big. So I must have made a mistake in the approach. Perhaps I should try a different method.

Alternative approach:

The photon's lifetime is limited when the interaction rate becomes significant. Another way to look at this is using the concept of photon attenuation length. The attenuation length L is the distance over which the photon's intensity decreases by a factor of e. So, L = 1/(n_photon * sigma).

So, L = 1/(n_photon * sigma )

But since the gamma-ray is moving at speed c, the time it takes to travel a distance L is tau = L/(c) = 1/(n_photon sigma c )

Which brings us back to the same tau expression as before.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should use the optical depth tau Optical depth is defined as N = n * sigma * L, where L is the path length. So, when N ≈1, the photon has a 1/e chance of being absorbed. So, perhaps the condition is that the optical depth is about 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the lifetime tau is such that the photon loses energy on a timescale tau. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should find the energy E where the interaction rate causes the photon to lose energy quickly enough that its lifetime is limited. Maybe the condition is that the photon's lifetime is on the order of the age of the universe, so that it can't propagate further than a certain distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the energy where the photon's lifetime equals the age of the universe.

So, tau = 1/(n_photon sigma c )

But sigma = (alpha^2 m_e^2 )/(s ), where s=4 E epsilon.

So,

sigma = alpha^2 m_e^2 / (4 E epsilon )

So,

tau = (4 E epsilon )/(n_photon alpha^2 m_e^2 c )

Solving for E:

E = (tau n_photon alpha^2 m_e^2 c )/(4 epsilon )

Now, let's compute each term.

tau: age of universe ~ 4.3e17 seconds.

n_photon: 411 cm^-3 = 4.11e8 m^-3.

alpha^2 = (1/137)^2 ≈5.32e-5.

m_e^2: (0.511 MeV)^2 = (0.511e6 eV )^2 = 0.261e12 eV².

But wait, units are important here. Let's compute each term in eV and seconds.

c = 3e8 m/s.

epsilon=1e-3 eV.

So,

E = (4.3e17 s *4.11e8 m^-3 *5.32e-5 * 0.261e12 eV² *3e8 m/s ) / (4 *1e-3 eV )

Let me compute numerator step by step.

Compute 4.3e17 *4.11e8: 4.3e17 *4.11e8 = 17.673e25 =1.7673e26.

Multiply by 5.32e-5: 1.7673e26 *5.32e-5 = (1.7673 *5.32 )e21 → approx 9.4e21.

Multiply by 0.261e12 eV^2: 9.4e21 *0.261e12 = (9.4 *0.261 )e33 eV² → 2.453e33 eV².

Multiply by 3e8 m/s: 2.453e33 eV² *3e8 m/s =7.359e41 eV²·m/s.

Denominator:4 *1e-3 eV =4e-3 eV.

So,

E = (7.359e41 eV²·m/s ) / (4e-3 eV )

= (7.359e41 )/(4e-3 ) eV·m/s.

= 1.83975e44 eV·m/s.

Now, the units are eV·m/s. To get energy in eV, we need to ensure the units are correct. Wait, perhaps I messed up unit conversion somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the numerator and denominator in terms of eV and seconds.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute everything in terms of eV and seconds.

Wait, let's try another approach. Let's convert all terms into eV and seconds.

m_e c^2 is 0.511 MeV, which is 0.511e6 eV.

So,

m_e^2 c^4 = (0.511e6 eV )^2 = (0.511)^2 * 1e12 eV² = 0.261e12 eV².

Now, putting all together:

E = (tau * n_photon * alpha^2 * m_e^2 c^4 ) / (4 * epsilon * c )

Because, wait, the earlier formula was:

E = (tau * n_photon * alpha^2 * m_e^2 c^2 )/(4 epsilon )

Wait, perhaps I missed a c^2 factor. Let me rederive.

Wait, from the formula:

tau = (4 E epsilon )/(n_photon alpha^2 m_e^2 c )

Wait, perhaps I should have:

tau = (4 E epsilon )/(n_photon alpha^2 (m_e c^2)^2 )

Because the cross-section formula involves m_e^2 c^4, which is (m_e c^2 )^2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the cross-section formula. Let me think again.

The cross-section sigma for two photons creating an electron-positron pair is:

sigma = (alpha^2 / (4 E epsilon )) * (m_e^2 c^4 ) / (s ) ), but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should refer to the standard formula for photon-photon cross-section.

Upon reflection, I recall that the cross-section for photon-photon annihilation into electron-positron pairs is given by:

sigma ≈ (8 π alpha^2 m_e^2)/(3 s ) * (1 + 2 m_e^2/s )

Where s is the center-of-mass energy squared. For high-energy photons where s >> m_e^2, this simplifies to sigma ≈ (8 π alpha^2 m_e^2)/(3 s )

But s =4 E epsilon, as we derived earlier. So,

sigma ≈ (8 π alpha^2 m_e^2 )/(3 *4 E epsilon ) ) = (2 pi alpha^2 m_e^2 )/(3 E epsilon )

Thus, the interaction rate Gamma = n_photon * sigma * c.

So,

Gamma = n_photon * (2 pi alpha^2 m_e^2 )/(3 E epsilon ) * c.

Thus, the lifetime tau = 1/Gamma = (3 E epsilon )/( 2 pi alpha^2 m_e^2 n_photon c )

Solving for E:

E = (tau * 2 pi alpha^2 m_e^2 n_photon c )/(3 epsilon )

Now, let's compute this with the numbers.

tau=4.3e17 s.

alpha=1/137≈0.007297.

m_e c^2=0.511e6 eV → m_e^2 c^4=(0.511e6 eV )^2=0.261e12 eV².

n_photon=4.11e8 m^-3.

c=3e8 m/s.

epsilon=1e-3 eV.

Calculate each term step by step.

First, compute numerator:

tau * 2 pi alpha^2 m_e^2 n_photon c.

Compute each part:

tau=4.3e17 s.

2 pi ≈6.283.

alpha^2≈5.32e-5.

m_e^2 c^4=0.261e12 eV².

n_photon=4.11e8 m^-3.

c=3e8 m/s.

Putting together:

4.3e17 *6.283 = (4.3 *6.283 )e17 ≈ 26.95e17 =2.695e18.

Multiply by alpha^2 (5.32e-5 ) →2.695e18 *5.32e-5 = (2.695 *5.32 )e13 → 14.33e13 =1.433e14.

Multiply by m_e^2 c^4 (0.261e12 eV² ) →1.433e14 *0.261e12 = (1.433*0.261 )e26 eV² → 0.374e26 =3.74e25 eV².

Multiply by n_photon (4.11e8 m^-3 ) →3.74e25 *4.11e8 = (3.74 *4.11 )e33 → approx 15.36e33 =1.536e34.

Multiply by c (3e8 m/s ) →1.536e34 *3e8 =4.608e42 eV²·m/s.

Denominator:3 * epsilon =3 *1e-3 eV =3e-3 eV.

So,

E = (4.608e42 eV²·m/s ) / (3e-3 eV ) ) = (4.608e42 )/(3e-3 ) eV·m/s.

= 1.536e45 eV·m/s.

But units don't make sense. To get energy in eV, I should have the units cancel properly. Wait, perhaps I missed a conversion factor involving c.

Wait, maybe I should have considered that when I include c, the units would be eV×m/s. But to get energy in eV, perhaps I should have multiplied by c and then divided by appropriate units.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to set the photon's lifetime equal to the age of the universe and then solve for E, but I'm getting stuck on the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should switch to natural units where c=1 and see if that helps.

But perhaps this is getting too convoluted. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I can use the formula for the photon's attenuation length.

The attenuation length L is given by L = 1/(n_photon sigma )

But in terms of energy, L = (4 E epsilon )/(n_photon alpha^2 m_e^2 )

Because sigma = (alpha^2 m_e^2 )/(4 E epsilon )

So,

L = 1/(n_photon * (alpha^2 m_e^2 )/(4 E epsilon )) ) = 4 E epsilon / (n_photon alpha^2 m_e^2 )

The time taken to travel this length is tau = L / c = (4 E epsilon )/(n_photon alpha^2 m_e^2 c )

So,

tau = (4 E epsilon )/(n_photon alpha^2 m_e^2 c )

Solving for E:

E = (n_photon alpha^2 m_e^2 c tau )/(4 epsilon )

Now, plugging in the numbers:

n_photon=4.11e8 m^-3.

alpha=1/137.

m_e c^2=0.511e6 eV → m_e^2 c^4= (0.511e6 eV )^2 = 0.261e12 eV².

c=3e8 m/s.

tau=4.3e17 s.

epsilon=1e-3 eV.

So,

E = (4.11e8 * (1/137)^2 *0.261e12 *3e8 *4.3e17 )/(4 *1e-3 )

Compute numerator:

4.11e8 * (1/137)^2 =4.11e8 *5.32e-5 ≈ 4.11e8 *5.32e-5 = (4.11*5.32 )e3 → 21.8e3 =2.18e4.

Multiply by 0.261e12 → 2.18e4 *0.261e12 =5.69e15.

Multiply by 3e8 →5.69e15 *3e8=1.707e24.

Multiply by 4.3e17 →1.707e24 *4.3e17 =7.34e41.

Denominator:4 *1e-3 =4e-3.

So,

E=7.34e41 /4e-3 =1.835e44 eV.

Again, this is way too high. So I'm probably making a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the following formula for the critical energy E_c where the photon's lifetime is limited by this process:

E_c ≈ 1.5 ×10^5 GeV × (epsilon / (1e-3 eV))^{-1} × (n_photon / (1 cm^-3 ))^{-1} × (tau / (10^10 years ))^{-1}

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a standard result.

I recall that the critical energy where the photon-photon interaction becomes significant is around the so-called "pair production threshold." The threshold occurs when the center-of-mass energy is at least 2 m_e c^2, which is about 1.02 MeV. But this is just the threshold for pair production. However, the cross-section increases rapidly with energy beyond that.

Wait, but the problem is about the energy where the photon's lifetime is limited by this process. The options are all in the order of 1e5 GeV, which is 1e12 eV. That's way higher than 1 MeV, so it's well above the threshold.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the critical energy is:

E_c ≈ (4 m_e^2 c^4 )/(epsilon) * (n_photon c tau )/(sigma_0 )

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy E can be found using E ≈ ( (m_e c^2 )^2 )/(epsilon ) * (n_photon c tau )/(sigma_0 )

But I'm not getting anywhere.

Another approach: use the formula for the photon's lifetime due to pair production.

The lifetime tau is given by:

tau = (4 E epsilon )/(n_photon alpha^2 m_e^2 c )

So,

E = (tau n_photon alpha^2 m_e^2 c )/(4 epsilon )

Plugging in numbers:

tau=4.3e17 s.

n_photon=4.11e8 m^-3.

alpha=1/137.

m_e c^2=0.511e6 eV.

c=3e8 m/s.

epsilon=1e-3 eV.

So,

Compute numerator:

4.3e17 *4.11e8 =1.7673e26.

Multiply by alpha^2 (5.32e-5) →1.7673e26 *5.32e-5 =9.4e21.

Multiply by (m_e c^2)^2 (0.511e6 eV)^2 →0.511e6=5.11e5 eV. So (5.11e5)^2=2.61e11 eV².

So, 9.4e21 *2.61e11 =2.45e33.

Multiply by c (3e8 m/s ) →2.45e33 *3e8 =7.35e41.

Denominator:4 *1e-3 eV=4e-3 eV.

So,

E=7.35e41 /4e-3 →1.8375e44 eV.

Again, way too high. So perhaps I have a fundamental mistake in the formula.

Alternative Idea: Perhaps I should consider the photon's energy in the rest frame of the CMB photon.

Wait, perhaps that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is E_c ~ (m_e c^2 )^2/(epsilon), multiplied by some factors involving the density and time.

Wait, but perhaps I should go back to the cross-section formula.

The cross-section sigma ≈ (8 pi alpha^2)/(3 s ), where s=4 E epsilon.

So,

sigma = (8 pi alpha^2 )/(3 *4 E epsilon ) ) = (2 pi alpha^2 )/(3 E epsilon )

So,

Gamma = n_photon * sigma * c = n_photon * (2 pi alpha^2 )/(3 E epsilon ) * c.

Thus,

tau = 1/(Gamma ) = (3 E epsilon )/( 2 pi alpha^2 n_photon c )

So,

E = (tau * 2 pi alpha^2 n_photon c )/(3 epsilon )

Plugging in the numbers:

tau=4.3e17 s.

2 pi ≈6.283.

alpha=1/137.

n_photon=4.11e8 m^-3.

c=3e8 m/s.

epsilon=1e-3 eV.

Compute numerator:

4.3e17 *6.283 = approx 2.695e18.

Multiply by alpha^2 (5.32e-5 ) →2.695e18 *5.32e-5 = approx1.433e14.

Multiply by n_photon (4.11e8 ) →1.433e14 *4.11e8 =5.91e22.

Multiply by c (3e8 ) →5.91e22 *3e8 =1.773e31.

Denominator:3 *1e-3 =3e-3.

So,

E =1.773e31 /3e-3 →5.91e33 eV.

Which is 5.91e33 eV, which is 5.91e24 TeV, way higher than the options given.

So, I'm stuck. None of the calculations are getting me anywhere near the options. I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should instead consider that the photon's lifetime is limited when the photon's energy loss rate is significant. But I'm not sure.

Another Idea: The photon's lifetime is determined by the probability of interaction per unit length. So, the mean free path is L=1/(n_photon sigma ), and the time is L/c =1/(n_photon sigma c ), which is the same as before.

But perhaps the cross-section formula is different. I think I might have the cross-section wrong. Let me look up the correct formula for the photon-photon cross-section for pair production.

Upon consulting my memory, the cross-section for photon-photon annihilation into e+ e- is given by:

sigma = (8 π alpha^2 m_e^2)/(3 s) * (1 + (2 m_e^2)/s )

Where s is the center-of-mass energy squared. For s >> 2 m_e^2, this simplifies to sigma ≈ (8 π alpha^2 m_e^2 )/(3 s )

And s=4 E epsilon.

So, sigma = (8 π alpha^2 m_e^2 )/(3 *4 E epsilon ) ) = (2 π alpha^2 m_e^2 )/(3 E epsilon )

So, Gamma = n_photon * sigma * c = n_photon * (2 π alpha^2 m_e^2 c )/(3 E epsilon )

Tau = 1/Gamma = 3 E epsilon / (2 π alpha^2 m_e^2 n_photon c )

So,

E = (tau * 2 π alpha^2 m_e^2 n_photon c )/(3 epsilon )

Now, substituting the numbers.

Compute numerator:

tau=4.3e17 s.

2 π ≈6.283.

alpha^2≈5.32e-5.

m_e^2 c^4= (0.511e6 eV )^2= 0.261e12 eV².

n_photon=4.11e8 m^-3.

c=3e8 m/s.

epsilon=1e-3 eV.

Compute numerator step by step.

tau *2 pi =4.3e17 *6.283≈2.7e18.

Multiply by alpha^2 (5.32e-5 ) →2.7e18 *5.32e-5 =1.436e14.

Multiply by m_e^2 c^4 (0.261e12 eV² ) →1.436e14 *0.261e12 =3.74e25 eV².

Multiply by n_photon (4.11e8 m^-3 ) →3.74e25 *4.11e8 =1.536e34.

Multiply by c (3e8 m/s ) →1.536e34 *3e8 =4.608e42 eV²·m/s.

Denominator:3 *epsilon =3e-3 eV.

So,

E =4.608e42 eV²·m/s / (3e-3 eV ) = (4.608e42 )/(3e-3 ) eV·m/s.

=1.536e45 eV·m/s.

Wait, but this still doesn't give me an energy in eV. I'm missing a unit conversion. Perhaps I should convert the units.

Wait, 1 eV·m/s is not a standard unit. Let me think in terms of eV and s.

Wait, perhaps I should have included the speed of light in the cross-section formula. Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered that the cross-section is in cm² or m².

Wait, perhaps I should convert sigma from m² to cm², but this might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor of c in the cross-section formula. For example, the cross-section might have a factor of c^2 in the denominator.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is sigma = (8 pi alpha^2 m_e^2 )/(3 s c^2 )

But then s=4 E epsilon c^2.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula includes c^2 in s. So, s= (E1 + E2 )^2 - (p1 c + p2 c )^2.

Wait, no, earlier derivation of s=4 E epsilon is correct because for photons moving in opposite directions, s=4 E epsilon.

Wait, maybe I'm getting stuck and should look for an alternative approach. Let me try to find the answer using the options.

Looking at the options:

A) 9.5e4 GeV = 9.5e4 *1e9 eV =9.5e13 eV.

B)1.8e5 GeV=1.8e5 *1e9=1.8e14 eV.

C)2.6e5 GeV=2.6e14 eV.

D)3.9e5 GeV=3.9e14 eV.

So, the options are all ~1e14 eV.

Let me try to compute E using a simplified formula.

Assume that E is about 1e14 eV.

Then,

s=4 E epsilon =4 *1e14 eV *1e-3 eV =4e11 (eV)^2.

Which is about 4e11 eV².

Now, compute sigma = (8 pi alpha^2 m_e^2 )/(3 s )

m_e^2 = (0.511e6 eV )^2 = 2.61e11 eV².

So,

sigma = (8 pi (1/137)^2 * 2.61e11 )/(3 *4e11 )

Compute numerator:

8 pi ≈25.1327.

(1/137)^2≈5.32e-5.

25.1327 *5.32e-5 ≈0.001339.

0.001339 *2.61e11 ≈3.49e8.

Denominator:3 *4e11=1.2e12.

So,

sigma≈3.49e8 /1.2e12 ≈2.91e-4 cm².

Wait, because cross-section is usually in cm². So 2.91e-4 cm² is 2.91e-4 *1e-4 m² =2.91e-8 m².

Now, compute Gamma =n_photon * sigma * c.

n_photon=4.11e8 m^-3.

sigma=2.91e-8 m².

c=3e8 m/s.

Gamma=4.11e8 *2.91e-8 *3e8 = (4.11e8 *2.91e-8 )= 4.11 *2.91 ≈11.95 →11.95 *3e8 →3.585e9 per second.

So, Gamma≈3.58e9 s^-1.

Thus, tau=1/Gamma≈2.8e-10 seconds.

Which is way shorter than the age of the universe. So for E=1e14 eV, the lifetime is only about 2.8e-10 seconds, which is way too short.

But the options are higher, so perhaps I should try a higher energy.

Wait, but the problem is that when I compute for E=1e14 eV, I get a much shorter lifetime than the age of the universe. So perhaps the correct E is lower. Let me try E=1e12 eV (1 TeV).

s=4 *1e12 eV *1e-3 eV =4e9 eV².

sigma =8 pi (1/137)^2 *2.61e11 / (3 *4e9 )

8 pi≈25.1327.

(1/137)^2≈5.32e-5.

25.1327 *5.32e-5≈0.001339.

0.001339 *2.61e11≈3.49e8.

Denominator=12e9.

sigma=3.49e8 /1.2e10 ≈2.91e-2 cm² =2.91e-6 m².

Gamma=4.11e8 *2.91e-6 *3e8 =4.11e8 *2.91e-6= 1194 *3e8= 3.58e11 s^-1.

Tau=1/3.58e11≈2.8e-12 seconds.

Still way too short.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to find E such that the lifetime is about the age of the universe (tau=4.3e17 s).

Let me set up the equation:

tau = (4 E epsilon )/(n_photon alpha^2 m_e^2 c )

Solve for E:

E = (tau n_photon alpha^2 m_e^2 c )/(4 epsilon )

Plugging in the numbers.

tau=4.3e17 s.

n_photon=4.11e8 m^-3.

alpha=1/137.

m_e^2 c^4= (0.511e6 eV )^2=2.61e11 eV².

c=3e8 m/s.

epsilon=1e-3 eV.

Compute numerator:

4.3e17 *4.11e8 =1.7673e26.

Multiply by alpha^2 (5.32e-5 ) →1.7673e26 *5.32e-5=9.4e21.

Multiply by m_e^2 c^4 (2.61e11 eV² ) →9.4e21 *2.61e11=2.45e33 eV².

Multiply by c (3e8 m/s ) →2.45e33 *3e8=7.35e41 eV²·m/s.

Denominator:4 *1e-3 eV=4e-3 eV.

So,

E=7.35e41 eV²·m/s /4e-3 eV =1.8375e44 eV·m/s.

Wait, but this still doesn't make sense. I must be making a mistake in the units.

Wait, perhaps I should avoid unit conversion and use natural units where c=1, but that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to note that the gamma-ray energy must be around the Compton energy of the CMB photon.

The Compton energy is E_cm= (epsilon * m_e c^2 )/(m_e c^2 + epsilon ) )≈ (epsilon * m_e c^2 )/(m_e c^2 ) )=epsilon.

Wait, no, that's not helpful.

Another Idea: Perhaps the energy E should be such that the product E * epsilon is on the order of (m_e c^2 )^2.

So, E * epsilon ≈ (m_e c^2 )^2.

m_e c^2=0.511 MeV=5.11e5 eV.

So,

E ≈ (5.11e5 eV )^2 / epsilon.

epsilon=1e-3 eV.

So,

E≈ (2.61e11 eV² ) / (1e-3 eV )=2.61e14 eV=2.61e14 eV=261e12 eV=261 TeV.

Wait, but 2.6e14 eV is 2.6e5 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 2.6e5 GeV.

So, perhaps the answer is C) 2.6e5 GeV.

Wait, this approach gives E ≈2.6e5 GeV, which matches option C.


The problem involves determining the energy of high-energy gamma-rays whose lifetimes in the universe are limited by their annihilation with CMB photons via the process $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$. The key is to calculate the energy $E$ at which the interaction rate becomes significant, such that the photon's lifetime $\tau$ is limited by this process.

The interaction rate $\Gamma$ is proportional to the cross-section $\sigma$ and the number density of CMB photons $n_{\text{photon}}$. The cross-section for $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$ is given by:

\[
\sigma \approx \frac{8\pi \alpha^2 m_e^2}{3s}, \quad s = 4E\epsilon,
\]

where $\alpha \approx 1/137$ is the fine-structure constant, $m_e$ is the electron mass, $E$ is the gamma-ray energy, and $\epsilon \approx 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$ is the average energy of CMB photons. Substituting $s = 4E\epsilon$, the cross-section becomes:

\[
\sigma \approx \frac{2\pi \alpha^2 m_e^2}{3E\epsilon}.
\]

The interaction rate is then:

\[
\Gamma = n_{\text{photon}} \sigma c = n_{\text{photon}} \frac{2\pi \alpha^2 m_e^2 c}{3E\epsilon}.
\]

The lifetime $\tau$ is the inverse of the interaction rate:

\[
\tau = \frac{1}{\Gamma} = \frac{3E\epsilon}{2\pi \alpha^2 n_{\text{photon}} m_e^2 c}.
\]

Rearranging for $E$:

\[
E = \frac{\tau \cdot 2\pi \alpha^2 n_{\text{photon}} m_e^2 c}{3\epsilon}.
\]

Substituting the constants:
- $\tau \approx 4.3 \times 10^{17} \, \text{s}$ (age of the universe),
- $n_{\text{photon}} \approx 4.11 \times 10^8 \, \text{m}^{-3}$,
- $\alpha \approx 1/137$,
- $m_e^2 c^4 \approx (0.511 \, \text{MeV})^2 = 2.61 \times 10^{11} \, \text{eV}^2$,
- $c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}$,
- $\epsilon = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$,

the numerator becomes:

\[
\tau \cdot 2\pi \alpha^2 n_{\text{photon}} m_e^2 c \approx 4.3 \times 10^{17} \cdot 6.283 \cdot 5.32 \times 10^{-5} \cdot 4.11 \times 10^8 \cdot 2.61 \times 10^{11} \cdot 3 \times 10^8,
\]

which evaluates to approximately $7.35 \times 10^{41} \, \text{eV}^2 \cdot \text{m/s}$. The denominator is $3 \cdot 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$. Thus:

\[
E \approx \frac{7.35 \times 10^{41}}{3 \times 10^{-3}} \, \text{eV} \approx 2.45 \times 10^{44} \, \text{eV}.
\]

However, this result is inconsistent with the provided options, suggesting a miscalculation in unit handling or constants. Instead, using a simpler scaling argument, the energy $E$ is determined by requiring $E \cdot \epsilon \approx (m_e c^2)^2$, leading to:

\[
E \approx \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{\epsilon} = \frac{(0.511 \, \text{MeV})^2}{10^{-3} \, \text{eV}} = \frac{(0.511 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV})^2}{10^{-3} \, \text{eV}} = 2.61 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV} = 2.61 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

This matches option **C**. Therefore, the energy at which the gamma-ray's lifetime is limited by the $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$ process is approximately **2.6 × 10⁵ GeV**.

Answer: C
