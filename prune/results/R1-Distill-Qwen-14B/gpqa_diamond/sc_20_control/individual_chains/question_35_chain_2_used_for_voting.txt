Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure out the correct statement about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem step by step.

So, the operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). Wait, that looks familiar. Oh right, S must be the Pauli Y-matrix. Because I remember the Pauli matrices, like σx, σy, σz. The σy matrix is indeed [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

So, Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy.

I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Eigenvalues come from solving the equation Ay φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenvector.

Wait, but since S (σy) is a 2x2 matrix, Ay is a 2x2 matrix too. Let me write it out. Let me compute Ay:

First, S is [[0, -i],[i, 0]]. Multiply each element by c = h/(4π).

So Ay becomes:
[ [0, -i*(h/(4π)) ],
  [i*(h/(4π)), 0] ]

Hmm, so the matrix has 0s on the diagonal and off-diagonal elements with i*h/(4π) and -i*h/(4π).

But wait, when finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a Pauli matrix multiplied by a constant, I can recall some properties. The Pauli matrices σx, σy, σz all have eigenvalues ±1. So when multiplied by a scalar, their eigenvalues are scaled by that scalar.

In this case, Ay = c * σy. So the eigenvalues of Ay would be c * (+1) and c * (-1). So a = ± c.

Wait, c is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π). But wait, wait. Let me think about this again. Oh wait, no. Because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues of ±1, so S (σy) has eigenvalues ±1. So Ay, which is c*S, will have eigenvalues c*(±1) → ± c. So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π). That’s the eigenvalues for Ay.

Wait, but let's confirm by actually computing the characteristic equation. The eigenvalues are found by det(Ay - aI) = 0.

So the matrix Ay - aI is:
[ [ -a,   -i*(h/(4π)) ],
  [ i*(h/(4π)),  -a ] ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) ].

So determinant = a² - [ (i * (-i)) * (h/(4π))² ) ]

Wait, i * (-i) is -i² = -(-1) = 1. So the term becomes (1) * (h²/(16 π²)).

So determinant is a² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0.

So a² = h²/(16 π²) → a = ± h/(4π). So yes, the eigenvalues are plus and minus h/(4π).

Looking at the options, let's check what each says.

Option A: Imaginary part of eigenvalue are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). Wait, that can't be right because the eigenvalues are real. So A is wrong because the eigenvalues are real, not complex. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Imaginary parts are ±1/2, real parts ±1. Hmm, that doesn't align with what I found. I have eigenvalues ±h/(4π). Unless h is taken as some specific value, but typically h is Planck's constant (~6.6e-34 J·s), which is a real number, so the eigenvalues are real. So B is also incorrect because the eigenvalues are real, not having imaginary parts. So B is wrong.

Option C: Eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Hmm. Wait, A is the intrinsic angular momentum operator. Remember that in quantum mechanics, the angular momentum components satisfy [Lx, Ly] = iħ Lz, etc. But when you're dealing with eigenstates, for example, the eigenstates of Lx are not eigenstates of Ly or Lz. However, if you square A (so A² = (h/(4π))² S² ), but S is σy, whose square is I, because σy² is identity matrix. So S² = I. So A² would be (h²/(16 π²)) I. So any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A², because A² is a multiple of identity. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A². So the first part of option C is correct.

But what about Az? Az is the z-component of the angular momentum. So, the eigenstate of Ay is not an eigenstate of Az. Because the angular momentum components don't commute. So yes, the same eigenfunctions can't be eigenfunctions of Az. So the statement in C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix Ay. Wait, I'm not sure what that means. Basis functions usually refer to the eigenvectors forming a basis. But the matrix Ay is 2x2, so its eigenvectors (which are two) form a basis for the vector space. So any vector can be expressed in terms of these eigenvectors. So the statement in D seems to be correct. But wait, the question is whether during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement is correct. So D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator, which is a bit vague. I'm more confident in option C's correctness.

Wait, let me think again. Option D says the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. Hmm, perhaps it's saying that the eigenvectors form a basis for the operator's matrix representation. That would be true, but so what? It's a general fact for diagonalizable matrices. But the statement might not be the correct one in the context of the problem. The question is, which statement is correct during the calculation.

Now, considering the options, option C is correct because eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² (since A² is proportional to identity), and not of Az because the components don't commute. So option C is correct.

To solve the problem, we analyze the operator \( A_y \), which is given as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli \( Y \)-matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Thus, \( A_y \) becomes:

\[
A_y = \frac{h}{4\pi} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( A_y \)
The eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are determined by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - aI) = 0 \). Substituting \( A_y \), the matrix \( A_y - aI \) is:

\[
A_y - aI = \begin{bmatrix} -a & -i\frac{h}{4\pi} \\ i\frac{h}{4\pi} & -a \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The determinant is:

\[
\det(A_y - aI) = (-a)(-a) - \left(-i\frac{h}{4\pi}\right)\left(i\frac{h}{4\pi}\right).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\det(A_y - aI) = a^2 - \left(-i^2\frac{h^2}{16\pi^2}\right) = a^2 - \frac{h^2}{16\pi^2}.
\]

Setting the determinant to zero:

\[
a^2 = \frac{h^2}{16\pi^2} \implies a = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi}.
\]

Thus, the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which are real.

### Step 2: Eigenvectors of \( A_y \)
The eigenvectors corresponding to these eigenvalues can be computed, but the exact form is not required for this problem.

### Step 3: Analyzing the Options
- **Option A**: Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \) and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are purely real (\( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \)).

- **Option B**: Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect because the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which are not \( \pm 1 \) or \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \).

- **Option C**: States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of \( A_z \). This is correct because \( A^2 \) is proportional to the identity matrix (since \( S^2 = I \)), making all eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \). However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \).

- **Option D**: States that the eigenfunctions \( \phi \) of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). While this is true in a general sense (eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space), it is not the most relevant or correct statement in the context of the problem.

### Final Answer
The correct statement is **Option C**, as it accurately describes the relationship between the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \).

So determinant = a² - [ (i * (-i)) * (h/(4π))² ) ]

Wait, i * (-i) is -i² = -(-1) = 1. So the term becomes (1) * (h²/(16 π²)).

So determinant is a² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0.

So a² = h²/(16 π²) → a = ± h/(4π). So yes, the eigenvalues are plus and minus h/(4π).
