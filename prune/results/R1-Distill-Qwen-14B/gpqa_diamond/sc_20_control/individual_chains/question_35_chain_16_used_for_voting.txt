Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question says that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, which is given as A_y = c·S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix with first row (0, -i) and second row (i, 0). So I think S is the Pauli matrix sigma_y, right? Because I remember the Pauli matrices are 2x2 and have similar structures. Sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], sigma_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], sigma_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]], so yeah, S looks like sigma_y.

The problem asks about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. So I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix operator.

First, let's write out A_y. Since A_y = c·S, and c is h/(4π), let me compute that. So A_y should be (h/(4π)) multiplied by the matrix S. So matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So when scaled by c, A_y becomes:

A_y = [[0, -i*(h/(4π))], [i*(h/(4π)), 0]]

Wait, but wait. No, I think I made a mistake. Because S is a matrix, and c is a scalar, so each element of S is multiplied by c. So:

A_y = c * S = [ [ c*0 , c*(-i) ], [c*(i), c*0 ] ] = [ [0, -i c ], [i c, 0 ] ]

But c is h/(4π), so plugging that in:

A_y = [ [0, -i*(h/(4π)) ], [i*(h/(4π)), 0 ] ]

Hmm, okay. So the matrix is:

Row 1: 0, -i h/(4π)
Row 2: i h/(4π), 0

To find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(A_y - a I ) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

So let's write A_y - a I:

[ [ -a , -i h/(4π) ],
  [ i h/(4π), -a ] ]

The determinant of this matrix is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π))(i h/(4π)) ].

Calculating that:

Determinant = a² - [ (-i)(i) * (h²)/(16 π²) ) ]

Wait, let me compute the product of the off-diagonal elements. The product is (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)).

Which is (-i)(i) * (h²)/(16 π² )

But (-i)(i) = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. Because i^2 is -1, so -i squared is (-i)*(-i) = i² = -1? Wait no, wait: Wait, let me recalculate that part. Oh, wait no, the product is ( -i * i ), so that's (-i^2) = - (i^2) = - (-1) = 1. Because i times i is i² = -1, so negative i times i is (-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) )= 1.

So the determinant is a² - [ (h²)/(16 π²) ) * (1) ) ] = 0

So the equation is a² - (h²)/(16 π²) ) = 0.

Thus, a² = (h²)/(16 π² )

Taking square roots, a = ± h/(4 π )

So the eigenvalues are a = h/(4 π ) and a = - h/(4 π )

Wait, but wait. So the eigenvalues are real? Because when I did the calculation, the determinant equation gave me a² = (h^2)/(16 π² ), so a is plus or minus h/(4 π ). So the eigenvalues are real numbers.

But wait a second. The operator A_y is a 2x2 matrix, which is anti-hermitian? Or is it hermitian? Because angular momentum operators are hermitian since they have real eigenvalues. Let me check. The matrix A_y is:

[ 0, -i c ]
[ i c, 0 ]

Wait, the matrix is [[0, -i c], [i c, 0]]. The conjugate transpose would be [[0, i c], [-i c, 0]], which is not the same as the original matrix. So A_y is not hermitian. Hmm, that's confusing because angular momentum operators should be hermitian, right?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in scaling. Because the Pauli matrices are hermitian. So S is hermitian, since S† = S. Let's check S:

S = [[0, -i],[i,0]]

The conjugate transpose of S would be [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is not the same as S. Wait, no. Let me compute S†:

First row of S is [0, -i], so the conjugate is [0, i], so the first column of S† is [0, i]. Second row of S is [i, 0], so conjugate is [-i, 0], which becomes the second column of S†. So S† is [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is not equal to S. So S is anti-hermitian? Or wait, maybe S is hermitian with a factor. Because S† = -S.

Let me check:

S† = [[0, i], [-i, 0]]

Compare to S = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So S† = - S. So S is anti-hermitian, because S† = -S. Then when I multiply by c, which is h/(4 pi ), and then A_y = c S. So A_y is c times anti-hermitian.

But wait, anti-hermitian means (A_y)† = - A_y. Then, if A_y is anti-hermitian, its eigenvalues would be purely imaginary, because for an anti-hermitian matrix, the eigenvalues are imaginary. So my previous calculation said that a is real, but that can't be right because A_y is anti-hermitian.

Wait, that's conflicting. So I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, let me double-check the characteristic equation. The matrix A_y is [[0, -i c], [i c, 0]], where c = h/(4 pi ). So the trace is 0, and the determinant is (i c)(-i c) = (-i^2) c^2 = (1) c^2. Because (i c)*(-i c) = (-i^2) c² = (1) c². So determinant is c². So then the characteristic equation is a² - c² = 0 → a = ± c. So a is real, which would imply that A_y is hermitian. But that's conflicting with what I thought earlier.

Wait, maybe I messed up the hermiticity. Let me recompute S's conjugate transpose. So S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. The conjugate of each element is [[0, i], [-i, 0]]. Then, the transpose would swap the off-diagonal elements. So S† is [[0, i], [-i, 0]], and S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S† is not equal to S, but is it equal to -S?

Let me compute -S: that would be [[0, i], [-i, 0]]. Which is exactly S†. So S† = -S → S is anti-hermitian. So A_y = c S, which would be anti-hermitian multiplied by a real scalar. So A_y is c S, which is anti-hermitian. Because (c S)† = c* S† = c (-S) = - (c S), since c is real (h and pi are real, so c = h/(4 pi ) is real).

So A_y is anti-hermitian. So any eigenvalues of an anti-hermitian operator must be purely imaginary. Because for any eigenvalue a of A_y, we have (A_y |ψ> ) = a |ψ>, and taking the inner product with <ψ|, we get a* = -a, so a must be imaginary.

But earlier, when I calculated the eigenvalues, I got a = ± c, which are real. That's a contradiction.

So where did I go wrong? Let me re-calculate the determinant. The matrix A_y is [[0, -i c], [i c, 0]]. The determinant is (0)(0) - (-i c)(i c) = - [ (-i c)(i c) ]

Which is - [ (-i²)(c^2) ) ] → - [ (-(-1)) c² ] → because i squared is -1. So (-i)(i) is -i² = 1. So the determinant is - [ (1)(c^2) ) ] = - c².

Wait, wait, no. The determinant is (0)(0) - (element [1,2] * element [2,1]) → 0 - [ (-i c) * (i c) ) ] → - [ (-i c)(i c) ].

So (-i c) * (i c) = (-i)(i) c² → (-i²) c² → c². Because i squared is -1, so (-i)(i)= -i²= 1. So the determinant is - (1 * c²) ) = -c².

So the characteristic equation is a² - (-c²) = 0 → a² + c² = 0 → a² = - c² → a = ± i c.

Wait, that's different from before. So my initial calculation was wrong. Because I thought the determinant was positive, but no, the determinant is (0)(0) - ( [1,2] * [2,1] ) → 0 - ( (-i c)(i c) ) → which is - [ (-i)(i) c² ] → - [ (1) c² ] → -c². So determinant is -c².

So the equation is a² - ( -c² ) = 0 → a² + c² =0 → a²= - c² → a= i c and a= -i c.

So the eigenvalues are a = i c and a= -i c.

Since c is h/(4 pi ), then a = i h/(4 pi ) and a= -i h/(4 pi )

So that makes sense, because A_y is anti-hermitian, so eigenvalues are purely imaginary. So the eigenvalues are ± i c, which are ± i h/(4 pi )

Now, looking at the options, let's see.

Option A says: The imaginary part of the eigenvalue of Ay are +2πh or –2πh, and the real parts are ± h/(4π ). But that doesn't make sense because if the eigenvalues are purely imaginary, their real parts should be zero. So A is wrong.

Option B: Imaginary parts are ±1/2, real parts ±1. That seems unrelated to our result. So probably not B.

Option C: The eigenfunction can also be eigenfunction of A^2, but not of Az. Hmm. Well, for angular momentum operators, the square of the operator commutes with all components, so if a state is an eigenstate of A_y, it's also an eigenstate of A^2. But whether it's an eigenstate of another component like Az is another matter. So maybe C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Not sure what that means. Basis functions usually refer to the basis in which the operator is diagonal. So if Ay is represented in a basis where it's diagonal, then the eigenfunctions are the basis functions. But if the operator isn't diagonal in the given basis, then the eigenfunctions would form a different basis. So perhaps D is correct.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So when finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement is correct.

So our eigenvalues are i c and -i c, where c is h/(4 pi ). So the eigenvalues are purely imaginary, which none of the options A or B seem to capture correctly. Let me recheck the options.

Wait, let me re-examine the options. Let me read the options again.

Option A: The imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are ±2πh, and real parts are ± h/(4π). But our eigenvalues are ±i h/(4 pi ), so the imaginary parts are ± h/(4 pi ), and real parts are zero. So A is wrong. Because it says imaginary parts are 2 pi h, which is much bigger than h/(4 pi ).

Option B: Imaginary parts are ±1/2, real parts are ±1. So the eigenvalues are (1, i 1/2) or similar. That doesn't match our result either. So B is wrong.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az.

Well, let's think about commuting operators. A^2 is the square of the angular momentum. Since A^2 commutes with all components, because [A^2, A_y] =0, so any eigenstate of A_y is also an eigenstate of A^2. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A^2. But for the other components, like Az, it's a different story. Because [A_y, Az] = iħ (something), so they don't commute. So a state can't be eigenstate of both A_y and Az. So the statement in C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Hmm. The operator Ay is 2x2, so its eigenvectors would form a basis. So the eigenfunctions are the basis vectors for the space, which is always true for a 2x2 matrix. So D is a correct statement.

Wait, but the problem is, during the calculation, which statement is correct. So which of these options are correct.

Wait, perhaps both C and D are correct. Let me think again.

Wait, option D says the eigenfunctions phi are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Since the operator is 2x2, its eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space, so any vector can be expressed in terms of them. So yes, the eigenfunctions are the basis functions. So D is correct.

So the options are C and D. But let me check the options again. The question is which statement is correct during the calculation.

Wait, the question says, "which statement below will you consider to be correct?".

So perhaps both C and D are correct, but let's see what the options are.

Wait, the question is about the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. So perhaps during this calculation, which statement is correct.

Option C says that the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az. Which is correct because A^2 commutes with A_y, so their eigenfunctions are shared. But Az doesn't commute with A_y, so they can't share eigenfunctions.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Which would be correct because the eigenvectors form the basis for the space in which Ay operates.

Hmm. So what's the correct answer?

Looking back at the options, the possible correct statements are either C and D or perhaps only one is correct.

So the eigenvalues are purely imaginary. So the options A and B are incorrect in their claims about the eigenvalues.

So the correct statements are among C and D.

Now, looking at option D: "The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above."

Wait, the term "basis functions" in this context probably refers to the set of eigenvectors forming an orthonormal basis for the space. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, its two eigenvectors (assuming they are distinct) would form a basis. So statement D is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is whether the eigenfunctions are the basis functions, which they are. So D is correct.

But option C says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A^2 but not of Az. Which is correct as well.

Wait, but the question is giving four options, and only one is correct, I think. Because it's a multiple-choice question.

Wait, the options are:

A) ... (wrong)

B) ... (wrong)

C) eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. (Correct)

D) eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. (Also correct)

Wait, but perhaps the correct answer is C and D. But in the options, only one option is correct.

Wait, no, because each option is a separate statement. So which of the four is correct.

So let me reevaluate.

When solving for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement is correct.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A². Since A² is the square of the angular momentum, and for any angular momentum component, the eigenstates of one component are eigenstates of A². So this is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Since the operator is 2x2, the eigenvectors form a basis, so this is correct.

So both C and D are correct statements.

But looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct. Wait, the problem is a multiple-choice with four options, so I must choose the correct one.

Wait, perhaps D's statement is always true, but C's statement is also true. So how do I choose between them?

Wait, the question is during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement is correct.

In reality, when you compute the eigenvectors, they form a basis, so D is correct. And the eigenfunctions of Ay are indeed eigenfunctions of A² (since A² is diagonal in the same basis), so C is correct.

Wait, but the options are given as separate statements. So the correct answer must be either C or D.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the eigenvalues. Let me redo the eigenvalue calculation.

The matrix Ay is [[0, -i c], [i c, 0]], where c = h/(4 pi )

To find the eigenvalues, determinant of (Ay - a I) = 0.

(Ay - a I) is [[-a, -i c], [i c, -a]]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i c)(i c) ] = a² - [ (-i c)(i c) ]

(-i c)(i c) = (-i)(i) c² = (i²) (-1) c²? Wait, (-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1. So it's 1 * c².

So determinant is a² - c² =0 → a² = c² → a= ±c.

Wait, but earlier I thought the determinant was -c², but now I'm getting a different result. Wait, no, let me recalculate:

(-i c) * (i c) = (-i)(i) c² = (-i^2) c² = (-(-1)) c² = c².

So determinant = a² - ( (-i c)(i c) ) → a² - (c²) → a² - c² =0 → a = ± c.

Wait, but that brings us back to a real eigenvalue, which would conflict with the anti-hermitian nature of Ay.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the determinant calculation again.

The determinant is calculated as (element 1,1) * (element 2,2) - (element 1,2) * (element 2,1). So ( -a ) * (-a ) – ( (-i c) ) * (i c )

= a² – [ (-i c)(i c) ) ]

Which is a² – [ (-i)(i) c² ]

= a² – [ (i)(-i) ) c² ] → because (-i)(i)= -i^2 = 1.

So it's a² – (1 * c² ) =0 → a² = c² → a= ± c.

So eigenvalues are a = c and a= -c, which are real. But earlier reasoning about S being anti-hermitian suggests that A_y is anti-hermitian, meaning its eigenvalues should be imaginary.

Conflict arises. So I must have made a mistake in determining if A_y is hermitian or not.

Wait, S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Let's compute S†:

The conjugate transpose of S is [[0, i], [-i, 0]].

Compare to S: [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So S† is equal to -S. Because:

- S = [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is the same as S†.

So S is anti-hermitian: S† = -S.

Then, A_y = c S, with c being a real scalar. So A_y is:

A_y = c S.

So (A_y)† = (c S)† = c* S† = c (S†) (because c is real) → c (-S) = - c S = - A_y.

So A_y is anti-hermitian.

But the eigenvalues of an anti-hermitian operator are purely imaginary. So how come the characteristic equation gives real eigenvalues?

This suggests that I made a mistake in the determinant calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the operator A_y is not anti-hermitian.

Wait, but S is anti-hermitian, so A_y = c S is anti-hermitian. Thus, eigenvalues must be purely imaginary.

So where's the mistake in the determinant calculation?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the determinant.

Matrix (Ay - a I) is:

[ -a , -i c ]

[ i c , -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - ( (-i c)(i c) )

= a² - [ (-i c)(i c) ]

= a² - [ (-i)(i) c² ]

= a² - [ (i^2) (-1) ) c² ] → because (-i)(i) is (-i^2) → so it's - (i²) → which is - (-1) → 1.

So a² - (1 * c² ) = 0 → a² = c² → a= ± c. So real eigenvalues.

But that contradicts the fact that A_y is anti-hermitian. So there must be an error in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the definition of A_y is wrong. The problem says that the operator A_y is c times S, where S is the given matrix. Wait, perhaps I should have used the Pauli matrices, which are hermitian, but scaled by something.

Wait, the Pauli sigma matrices are hermitian, so if S is sigma_y, which is hermitian, then A_y would be c times a hermitian matrix, making A_y hermitian. But in that case, the eigenvalues would be real. But in the problem, S is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is sigma_y, which is hermitian?

Wait, sigma_y is hermitian?

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute S† again.

S = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

S† is the conjugate transpose, so [[0, i], [-i, 0]]

Which is equal to -S, since:

- S = [[0, i], [-i, 0]]

So S† = - S → S is anti-hermitian.

Thus, A_y is c S, which is anti-hermitian, so eigenvalues should be imaginary.

But according to the characteristic equation, we get real eigenvalues. So something is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I have a miscalculation in the determinant.

Wait, let me recompute the determinant.

The matrix is [[-a, -i c], [i c, -a]]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - (-i c)(i c) = a² - [ (-i c)(i c) ]

Wait, (-i c) * (i c) = (-i)(i) c² = (i * -i) c² → i*(-i) is (-i²) → which is -(-1) → 1.

So the determinant is a² - c² =0 → a² = c² → a= ± c.

But that implies real eigenvalues, which can't be correct for an anti-hermitian operator. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the matrix setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the matrix S given in the problem is not the same as sigma_y. Let me check the problem statement again.

The operator Ay is c·S, with S being a 2x2 matrix, first row (0 -i), second row (i 0). So S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is exactly sigma_y multiplied by -i. Because sigma_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]? Wait, no, sigma_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]? Let me check. No, the standard sigma matrices are:

sigma_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]

sigma_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]

sigma_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So yes, the S given is sigma_y. Which is hermitian? Wait, sigma_y is hermitian because its conjugate transpose is the same as itself.

Wait, let's compute sigma_y†:

sigma_y† = [[0, i], [-i, 0]]

Which is not the same as sigma_y. Because sigma_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

So sigma_y† = [[0, i], [-i, 0]] = - sigma_y. Because:

-sigma_y is [[0, i], [-i, 0]]

Which is equal to sigma_y†.

So sigma_y is anti-hermitian, not hermitian.

Wait, that can't be right because I thought the Pauli matrices were hermitian. So perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, sigma_y is supposed to be hermitian. Let me check again. The hermitian condition is sigma_y† = sigma_y.

sigma_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

sigma_y† is [[0, i], [-i, 0]]

Is that equal to sigma_y? No. Because the first row is [0, i], which is not the same as [0, -i]. So sigma_y is not hermitian. That's conflicting with what I thought.

Wait, no, I think I must have made a mistake. Because I'm pretty sure sigma_y is hermitian. Let me compute sigma_y^dagger.

Wait, sigma_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

The conjugate transpose (sigma_y^dagger) is [[0, i], [-i, 0]]

Which is not the same as sigma_y. So sigma_y is not hermitian. That can't be correct.

Wait, no, let me check again. Oh wait, perhaps I'm confusing sigma_y with another matrix. Let me make sure.

Wait, sigma matrices are defined as:

sigma_x = [[1,0],[0,-1]]? No, no. sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]

sigma_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]]

sigma_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Wait, so sigma_y is [[0, -i], [i,0]]

So sigma_y^dagger is [[0, i], [-i, 0]]

Which is equal to - sigma_y.

So sigma_y is anti-hermitian, because sigma_y^dagger = - sigma_y.

That's the opposite of what I thought earlier. So S is sigma_y, which is anti-hermitian. Then, A_y = c * S, which is anti-hermitian.

So the eigenvalues should be purely imaginary.

But according to the determinant calculation, the eigenvalues are real, which is a contradiction.

So where is the mistake?

Wait, perhaps the determinant calculation is wrong.

Let me recalculate the determinant of (Ay - a I):

Ay - a I = [[-a, -i c], [i c, -a]]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - (-i c)(i c) = a² - [ (-i c)(i c) ]

Which is a² - [ (-i)(i) c² ] = a² - [ (i*(-i)) c² ]

i*(-i) = -i² = - (-1) = 1.

So determinant is a² - c².

Set to zero: a² - c² =0 → a² = c² → a= ± c.

But that's real, which is not matching the anti-hermitian expectation.

Alternatively, perhaps the definition is different. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps the operator A is defined as A = ħ S, but in this problem, c is h/(4 pi ), which is (2 pi ) * (h/(2 pi )) / (2 pi ) ) → perhaps c is related to the reduced Planck constant.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the units. Let me see: h is Planck's constant (6.626e-34 J s), ħ is h/(2 pi ), approximately 1.05e-34 J s.

In the problem, c is h/(4 pi ), which is ħ / 2.

So c = (h/(2 pi )) / 2 = ħ / 2.

So A_y = (ħ/2) * S.

Since S is anti-hermitian, A_y is (ħ/2) times anti-hermitian, so A_y is anti-hermitian.

So eigenvalues should be imaginary.

Hmm. But according to the calculation, the eigenvalues are real. This suggests a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try another approach. Let's compute the eigenvalues directly.

The matrix A_y is:

[ [0, -i c], [i c, 0] ]

To find the eigenvalues, solve (Ay - a I ) |v> =0.

So the system is:

- a v1 + (-i c) v2 =0

i c v1 - a v2 =0

These two equations must be satisfied.

From the first equation: (-a) v1 + (-i c) v2 =0 → v1 = (i c / a ) v2.

From the second equation: i c v1 - a v2 =0 → substitute v1 from first equation:

i c (i c v2 / a ) - a v2 =0 → (i^2 c² v2 / a ) - a v2 =0 → (- c² v2 / a ) - a v2=0.

Factor out v2:

[ (-c² / a ) - a ] v2 =0.

Assuming v2 ≠0,

→ (-c² / a - a ) =0 → (-c² - a² ) / a =0 → numerator must be zero → -c² -a² =0 → a² = - c² → a= ± i c.

Ah, there's the mistake. Earlier, I thought the determinant was a² - c²=0, but actually, the correct equation is a² = - c².

So the eigenvalues are a = i c and a= -i c.

Which are purely imaginary, as expected for an anti-hermitian operator. So earlier mistake was in the determinant calculation.

Thus, the eigenvalues are a= i c and a= -i c.

So the eigenvalues have zero real parts and imaginary parts ±c.

So the options:

Option A: imaginary parts ±2 pi h, real parts ± h/(4 pi ). 

But our c is h/(4 pi ), so the eigenvalues are ± i h/(4 pi ). So the real parts are zero, which is not what option A says. So A is wrong.

Option B: imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. Doesn't match.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Correct, since A² commutes with A_y.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Correct, because the eigenvectors form a basis.

So the correct statements are C and D. But the options are to choose which statement is correct.

Wait, the question is during the calculation, which statement will you consider correct.

So considering the options, both C and D are correct statements. But since it's a multiple-choice question, only one option can be correct. So perhaps I've made a mistake in evaluating the options.

Wait, looking back, the problem states that the matrix operator is given, and we're to calculate its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

So option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator, which is true because any operator's eigenvectors (if distinct) form a basis for the space.

So all the options, but only one is correct. So perhaps the correct answer is option C and D are both correct, but looking at the options, perhaps only C is correct.

Wait, but the question gives four options, and only one is correct. Let me re-read the options.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Yes, because A² commutes with all components, so they share eigenfunctions. But Az does not commute with Ay, so they can't share eigenfunctions.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay.

Yes, because the eigenvectors form a basis.

So both C and D are correct statements, but the options only allow selecting one. But perhaps in the options, only one is correct.

Wait, let me think about this again.

The problem is about the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. So which statement would be considered correct during that calculation.

Option C is a statement about the relationship between eigenfunctions of Ay and other operators, whereas option D is a statement about the basis.

But perhaps the correct answer is option C because during the calculation, you'd recognize that the eigenfunctions are shared with A² but not Az.

But I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps only option C is correct.

Wait, perhaps looking at the options again.

Option D says the eigenfunctions phi are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. That is, the eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space (which is 2D, so yes, they do). So D is correct.

But the options are presented as separate choices, so perhaps both C and D are correct. But since the options are presented as A, B, C, D, perhaps I have to choose the correct one.

Alternatively, perhaps option C is correct and D is incorrect.

Wait, no. The statement in D is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the operator's space.

So perhaps the correct answer is both C and D, but since the options are presented as four choices, only one can be selected. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Alternatively, the correct answer is option C and D are correct, but the options are presented such that only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

But this is getting complicated. Let me recap the key points:

- The eigenvalues of Ay are ±i c, where c = h/(4 pi )

- The eigenfunctions form a basis (so D is correct)

- The eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² (so C is correct)

So both C and D are correct statements. But the options don't allow for selecting two.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C because it's about the relationship between different operators, which is a key point during the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is D.

But looking back at the problem, the question is during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement is correct.

So when solving for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, one would note that the eigenfunctions form a basis (option D), and that they are eigenfunctions of A² (option C).

But since the options are separate, perhaps the correct answer is option C and D are both correct, but only one option is given as correct.

But the options are mutually exclusive, so perhaps only one of C or D is correct.

Wait, the problem asks which statement is correct, so looking for the correct one.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is correct because in the calculation, the eigenvectors form a basis.

Thus, the correct answer is option C and D. But since only one can be chosen, perhaps D is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options again.

Option C says: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Yes, that's correct because [A_y, A²]=0, but [A_y, Az] ≠0.

Option D says: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay.

Which is correct because the eigenvectors of a matrix form a basis for the vector space (assuming they are linearly independent, which they are here).

So both C and D are correct statements.

But the options are presented as four choices, so perhaps only one is correct.

But the problem gives four options, each as a separate statement, so perhaps more than one is correct, but the user is to select all that apply. However, the question seems to imply a single correct answer.

Given that, perhaps the intended correct answer is option C. Because option D's statement is somewhat trivially true for any matrix, whereas option C makes a specific claim about the eigenfunctions in relation to another operator.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the options again.

The problem is about the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. So during this calculation, which statement is correct.

Option D is a general statement about the eigenfunctions being the basis functions of Ay, which is always true because the eigenvectors form a basis.

So during the calculation, you would consider that the eigenfunctions form a basis, making D correct.

So among the options, the correct statements are C and D. But since the options are mutually exclusive, perhaps the intended correct answer is option C.

But this is getting too confusing. Let me try to make a decision.

The correct eigenvalues are ±i c, which are purely imaginary. So none of the options A or B are correct.

The correct statements are C and D. But since only one can be chosen, perhaps the intended answer is option C.

Wait, but the problem is that the options are presented, and only one is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

But I might have to proceed with the conclusion that option C is correct.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), which is defined as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Matrix Representation of \( A_y \):**
   Substituting \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \), the operator \( A_y \) becomes:
   \[
   A_y = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \frac{h}{4\pi} \\ i \frac{h}{4\pi} & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   To find the eigenvalues, solve the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - aI) = 0 \):
   \[
   \det\begin{bmatrix} -a & -i \frac{h}{4\pi} \\ i \frac{h}{4\pi} & -a \end{bmatrix} = a^2 - \left(-i \frac{h}{4\pi}\right)\left(i \frac{h}{4\pi}\right) = a^2 - \frac{h^2}{16\pi^2}.
   \]
   Setting this equal to zero gives:
   \[
   a^2 = \frac{h^2}{16\pi^2} \implies a = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi}.
   \]
   Thus, the eigenvalues are \( a = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which are real numbers.

3. **Hermiticity of \( A_y \):**
   The matrix \( S \) is anti-hermitian, as \( S^\dagger = -S \). Since \( A_y = c \cdot S \), \( A_y \) is also anti-hermitian. For an anti-hermitian operator, the eigenvalues should be purely imaginary. This creates a contradiction with the calculated real eigenvalues, suggesting a potential issue in interpreting the hermiticity of \( A_y \).

4. **Eigenvectors and Basis Functions:**
   The eigenvectors of \( A_y \) form a basis for the 2D vector space. This makes **Option D** correct, as the eigenfunctions are indeed the basis functions of \( A_y \).

5. **Relationship with \( A^2 \) and \( A_z \):**
   The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are also eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \). However, \( A_y \) does not commute with \( A_z \), so the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \). This makes **Option C** correct.

### Evaluation of Options:

- **Option A:** Incorrect. The eigenvalues are real (\( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \)), not purely imaginary with imaginary parts \( \pm 2\pi h \).
- **Option B:** Incorrect. The eigenvalues do not match the values given in this option.
- **Option C:** Correct. The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of \( A_z \).
- **Option D:** Correct. The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) form a basis for the operator.

### Conclusion:

Both **Option C** and **Option D** are correct statements. However, since the question requires selecting only one option, **Option C** is the most relevant during the calculation, as it highlights the relationship between \( A_y \) and other operators.

ANSWER: C

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question says that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, which is given as A_y = c·S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix with first row (0, -i) and second row (i, 0). So I think S is the Pauli matrix sigma_y, right? Because I remember the Pauli matrices are 2x2 and have similar structures. Sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], sigma_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], sigma_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]], so yeah, S looks like sigma_y.

The problem asks about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. So I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix operator.

First, let's write out A_y. Since A_y = c·S, and c is h/(4π), let me compute that. So A_y should be (h/(4π)) multiplied by the matrix S. So matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So when scaled by c, A_y becomes:

A_y = [[0, -i*(h/(4π))], [i*(h/(4π)), 0]]

Wait, but wait. No, I think I made a mistake. Because S is a matrix, and c is a scalar, so each element of S is multiplied by c. So:

A_y = c * S = [ [ c*0 , c*(-i) ], [c*(i), c*0 ] ] = [ [0, -i c ], [i c, 0 ] ]

But c is h/(4π), so plugging that in:

A_y = [ [0, -i*(h/(4π)) ], [i*(h/(4π)), 0 ] ]

Hmm, okay. So the matrix is:

Row 1: 0, -i h/(4π)
Row 2: i h/(4π), 0

To find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(A_y - a I ) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

So let's write A_y - a I:

[ [ -a , -i h/(4π) ],
  [ i h/(4π), -a ] ]

The determinant of this matrix is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π))(i h/(4π)) ].

Calculating that:

Determinant = a² - [ (-i)(i) * (h²)/(16 π²) ) ]

Wait, let me compute the product of the off-diagonal elements. The product is (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)).

Which is (-i)(i) * (h²)/(16 π² )

But (-i)(i) = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. Because i^2 is -1, so -i squared is (-i)*(-i) = i² = -1? Wait no, wait: Wait, let me recalculate that part. Oh, wait no, the product is ( -i * i ), so that's (-i^2) = - (i^2) = - (-1) = 1. Because i times i is i² = -1, so negative i times i is (-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) )= 1.

So the determinant is a² - [ (h²)/(16 π²) ) * (1) ) ] = 0

So the equation is a² - (h²)/(16 π²) ) = 0.

Thus, a² = (h²)/(16 π² )

Taking square roots, a = ± h/(4 π )

So the eigenvalues are a = h/(4 π ) and a = - h/(4 π )

Wait, but wait. So the eigenvalues are real? Because when I did the calculation, the determinant equation gave me a² = (h^2)/(16 π² ), so a is plus or minus h/(4 π ). So the eigenvalues are real numbers.

But wait a second. The operator A_y is a 2x2 matrix, which is anti-hermitian? Or is it hermitian? Because angular momentum operators are hermitian since they have real eigenvalues. Let me check. The matrix A_y is:

[ 0, -i c ]
[ i c, 0 ]

Wait, the matrix is [[0, -i c], [i c, 0]]. The conjugate transpose would be [[0, i c], [-i c, 0]], which is not the same as the original matrix. So A_y is not hermitian. Hmm, that's confusing because angular momentum operators should be hermitian, right?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in scaling. Because the Pauli matrices are hermitian. So S is hermitian, since S† = S. Let's check S:

S = [[0, -i],[i,0]]

The conjugate transpose of S would be [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is not the same as S. Wait, no. Let me compute S†:

First row of S is [0, -i], so the conjugate is [0, i], so the first column of S† is [0, i]. Second row of S is [i, 0], so conjugate is [-i, 0], which becomes the second column of S†. So S† is [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is not equal to S. So S is anti-hermitian? Or wait, maybe S is hermitian with a factor. Because S† = -S.

Let me check:

S† = [[0, i], [-i, 0]]

Compare to S = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So S† = - S. So S is anti-hermitian, because S† = -S. Then when I multiply by c, which is h/(4 pi ), and then A_y = c S. So A_y is c times anti-hermitian.

But wait, anti-hermitian means (A_y)† = - A_y. Then, if A_y is anti-hermitian, its eigenvalues would be purely imaginary, because for an anti-hermitian matrix, the eigenvalues are imaginary. So my previous calculation said that a is real, but that can't be right because A_y is anti-hermitian.

Wait, that's conflicting. So I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, let me double-check the characteristic equation. The matrix A_y is [[0, -i c], [i c, 0]], where c = h/(4 pi ). So the trace is 0, and the determinant is (i c)(-i c) = (-i^2) c^2 = (1) c^2. Because (i c)*(-i c) = (-i^2) c² = (1) c². So determinant is c². So then the characteristic equation is a² - c² = 0 → a = ± c. So a is real, which would imply that A_y is hermitian. But that's conflicting with what I thought earlier.

Wait, maybe I messed up the hermiticity. Let me recompute S's conjugate transpose. So S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. The conjugate of each element is [[0, i], [-i, 0]]. Then, the transpose would swap the off-diagonal elements. So S† is [[0, i], [-i, 0]], and S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S† is not equal to S, but is it equal to -S?

Let me compute -S: that would be [[0, i], [-i, 0]]. Which is exactly S†. So S† = -S → S is anti-hermitian. So A_y = c S, which would be anti-hermitian multiplied by a real scalar. So A_y is c S, which is anti-hermitian. Because (c S)† = c* S† = c (-S) = - (c S), since c is real (h and pi are real, so c = h/(4 pi ) is real).

So A_y is anti-hermitian. So any eigenvalues of an anti-hermitian operator must be purely imaginary. Because for any eigenvalue a of A_y, we have (A_y |ψ> ) = a |ψ>, and taking the inner product with <ψ|, we get a* = -a, so a must be imaginary.

But earlier, when I calculated the eigenvalues, I got a = ± c, which are real. That's a contradiction.

So where did I go wrong? Let me re-calculate the determinant. The matrix A_y is [[0, -i c], [i c, 0]]. The determinant is (0)(0) - (-i c)(i c) = - [ (-i c)(i c) ]

Which is - [ (-i²)(c^2) ) ] → - [ (-(-1)) c² ] → because i squared is -1. So (-i)(i) is -i² = 1. So the determinant is - [ (1)(c^2) ) ] = - c².

Wait, wait, no. The determinant is (0)(0) - (element [1,2] * element [2,1]) → 0 - [ (-i c) * (i c) ) ] → - [ (-i c)(i c) ].

So (-i c) * (i c) = (-i)(i) c² → (-i²) c² → c². Because i squared is -1, so (-i)(i)= -i²= 1. So the determinant is - (1 * c²) ) = -c².

So the characteristic equation is a² - (-c²) = 0 → a² + c² = 0 → a² = - c² → a = ± i c.

Wait, that's different from before. So my initial calculation was wrong. Because I thought the determinant was positive, but no, the determinant is (0)(0) - ( [1,2] * [2,1] ) → 0 - ( (-i c)(i c) ) → which is - [ (-i)(i) c² ] → - [ (1) c² ] → -c². So determinant is -c².

So the equation is a² - ( -c² ) = 0 → a² + c² =0 → a²= - c² → a= i c and a= -i c.

So the eigenvalues are a = i c and a= -i c.

Since c is h/(4 pi ), then a = i h/(4 pi ) and a= -i h/(4 pi )

So that makes sense, because A_y is anti-hermitian, so eigenvalues are purely imaginary. So the eigenvalues are ± i c, which are ± i h/(4 pi )

Now, looking at the options, let's see.

Option A says: The imaginary part of the eigenvalue of Ay are +2πh or –2πh, and the real parts are ± h/(4π ). But that doesn't make sense because if the eigenvalues are purely imaginary, their real parts should be zero. So A is wrong.

Option B: Imaginary parts are ±1/2, real parts ±1. That seems unrelated to our result. So probably not B.

Option C: The eigenfunction can also be eigenfunction of A^2, but not of Az. Hmm. Well, for angular momentum operators, the square of the operator commutes with all components, so if a state is an eigenstate of A_y, it's also an eigenstate of A^2. But whether it's an eigenstate of another component like Az is another matter. So maybe C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Not sure what that means. Basis functions usually refer to the basis in which the operator is diagonal. So if Ay is represented in a basis where it's diagonal, then the eigenfunctions are the basis functions. But if the operator isn't diagonal in the given basis, then the eigenfunctions would form a different basis. So perhaps D is correct.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So when finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement is correct.

So our eigenvalues are i c and -i c, where c is h/(4 pi ). So the eigenvalues are purely imaginary, which none of the options A or B seem to capture correctly. Let me recheck the options.

Wait, let me re-examine the options. Let me read the options again.

Option A: The imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are ±2πh, and real parts are ± h/(4π). But our eigenvalues are ±i h/(4 pi ), so the imaginary parts are ± h/(4 pi ), and real parts are zero. So A is wrong. Because it says imaginary parts are 2 pi h, which is much bigger than h/(4 pi ).

Option B: Imaginary parts are ±1/2, real parts are ±1. So the eigenvalues are (1, i 1/2) or similar. That doesn't match our result either. So B is wrong.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az.

Well, let's think about commuting operators. A^2 is the square of the angular momentum. Since A^2 commutes with all components, because [A^2, A_y] =0, so any eigenstate of A_y is also an eigenstate of A^2. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A^2. But for the other components, like Az, it's a different story. Because [A_y, Az] = iħ (something), so they don't commute. So a state can't be eigenstate of both A_y and Az. So the statement in C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Hmm. The operator Ay is 2x2, so its eigenvectors would form a basis. So the eigenfunctions are the basis vectors for the space, which is always true for a 2x2 matrix. So D is a correct statement.

Wait, but the problem is, during the calculation, which statement is correct. So which of these options are correct.

Wait, perhaps both C and D are correct. Let me think again.

Wait, option D says the eigenfunctions phi are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Since the operator is 2x2, its eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space, so any vector can be expressed in terms of them. So yes, the eigenfunctions are the basis functions. So D is correct.

So the options are C and D. But let me check the options again. The question is which statement is correct during the calculation.

Wait, the question says, "which statement below will you consider to be correct?".

So perhaps both C and D are correct, but let's see what the options are.

Wait, the question is about the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. So perhaps during this calculation, which statement is correct.

Option C says that the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az. Which is correct because A^2 commutes with A_y, so their eigenfunctions are shared. But Az doesn't commute with A_y, so they can't share eigenfunctions.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Which would be correct because the eigenvectors form the basis for the space in which Ay operates.

Hmm. So what's the correct answer?

Looking back at the options, the possible correct statements are either C and D or perhaps only one is correct.

So the eigenvalues are purely imaginary. So the options A and B are incorrect in their claims about the eigenvalues.

So the correct statements are among C and D.

Now, looking at option D: "The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above."

Wait, the term "basis functions" in this context probably refers to the set of eigenvectors forming an orthonormal basis for the space. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, its two eigenvectors (assuming they are distinct) would form a basis. So statement D is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is whether the eigenfunctions are the basis functions, which they are. So D is correct.

But option C says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A^2 but not of Az. Which is correct as well.

Wait, but the question is giving four options, and only one is correct, I think. Because it's a multiple-choice question.

Wait, the options are:

A) ... (wrong)

B) ... (wrong)

C) eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. (Correct)

D) eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. (Also correct)

Wait, but perhaps the correct answer is C and D. But in the options, only one option is correct.

Wait, no, because each option is a separate statement. So which of the four is correct.

So let me reevaluate.

When solving for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement is correct.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A². Since A² is the square of the angular momentum, and for any angular momentum component, the eigenstates of one component are eigenstates of A². So this is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Since the operator is 2x2, the eigenvectors form a basis, so this is correct.

So both C and D are correct statements.

But looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct. Wait, the problem is a multiple-choice with four options, so I must choose the correct one.

Wait, perhaps D's statement is always true, but C's statement is also true. So how do I choose between them?

Wait, the question is during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement is correct.

In reality, when you compute the eigenvectors, they form a basis, so D is correct. And the eigenfunctions of Ay are indeed eigenfunctions of A² (since A² is diagonal in the same basis), so C is correct.

Wait, but the options are given as separate statements. So the correct answer must be either C or D.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the eigenvalues. Let me redo the eigenvalue calculation.

The matrix Ay is [[0, -i c], [i c, 0]], where c = h/(4 pi )

To find the eigenvalues, determinant of (Ay - a I) = 0.

(Ay - a I) is [[-a, -i c], [i c, -a]]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i c)(i c) ] = a² - [ (-i c)(i c) ]

(-i c)(i c) = (-i)(i) c² = (i²) (-1) c²? Wait, (-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1. So it's 1 * c².

So determinant is a² - c² =0 → a² = c² → a= ±c.

Wait, but earlier I thought the determinant was -c², but now I'm getting a different result. Wait, no, let me recalculate:

(-i c) * (i c) = (-i)(i) c² = (-i^2) c² = (-(-1)) c² = c².

So determinant = a² - ( (-i c)(i c) ) → a² - (c²) → a² - c² =0 → a = ± c.

Wait, but that brings us back to a real eigenvalue, which would conflict with the anti-hermitian nature of Ay.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the determinant calculation again.

The determinant is calculated as (element 1,1) * (element 2,2) - (element 1,2) * (element 2,1). So ( -a ) * (-a ) – ( (-i c) ) * (i c )

= a² – [ (-i c)(i c) ) ]

Which is a² – [ (-i)(i) c² ]

= a² – [ (i)(-i) ) c² ] → because (-i)(i)= -i^2 = 1.

So it's a² – (1 * c² ) =0 → a² = c² → a= ± c.

So eigenvalues are a = c and a= -c, which are real. But earlier reasoning about S being anti-hermitian suggests that A_y is anti-hermitian, meaning its eigenvalues should be imaginary.

Conflict arises. So I must have made a mistake in determining if A_y is hermitian or not.

Wait, S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Let's compute S†:

The conjugate transpose of S is [[0, i], [-i, 0]].

Compare to S: [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So S† is equal to -S. Because:

- S = [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is the same as S†.

So S is anti-hermitian: S† = -S.

Then, A_y = c S, with c being a real scalar. So A_y is:

A_y = c S.

So (A_y)† = (c S)† = c* S† = c (S†) (because c is real) → c (-S) = - c S = - A_y.

So A_y is anti-hermitian.

But the eigenvalues of an anti-hermitian operator are purely imaginary. So how come the characteristic equation gives real eigenvalues?

This suggests that I made a mistake in the determinant calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the operator A_y is not anti-hermitian.

Wait, but S is anti-hermitian, so A_y = c S is anti-hermitian. Thus, eigenvalues must be purely imaginary.

So where's the mistake in the determinant calculation?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the determinant.

Matrix (Ay - a I) is:

[ -a , -i c ]

[ i c , -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - ( (-i c)(i c) )

= a² - [ (-i c)(i c) ]

= a² - [ (-i)(i) c² ]

= a² - [ (i^2) (-1) ) c² ] → because (-i)(i) is (-i^2) → so it's - (i²) → which is - (-1) → 1.

So a² - (1 * c² ) = 0 → a² = c² → a= ± c. So real eigenvalues.

But that contradicts the fact that A_y is anti-hermitian. So there must be an error in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the definition of A_y is wrong. The problem says that the operator A_y is c times S, where S is the given matrix. Wait, perhaps I should have used the Pauli matrices, which are hermitian, but scaled by something.

Wait, the Pauli sigma matrices are hermitian, so if S is sigma_y, which is hermitian, then A_y would be c times a hermitian matrix, making A_y hermitian. But in that case, the eigenvalues would be real. But in the problem, S is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is sigma_y, which is hermitian?

Wait, sigma_y is hermitian?

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute S† again.

S = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

S† is the conjugate transpose, so [[0, i], [-i, 0]]

Which is equal to -S, since:

- S = [[0, i], [-i, 0]]

So S† = - S → S is anti-hermitian.

Thus, A_y is c S, which is anti-hermitian, so eigenvalues should be imaginary.

But according to the characteristic equation, we get real eigenvalues. So something is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I have a miscalculation in the determinant.

Wait, let me recompute the determinant.

The matrix is [[-a, -i c], [i c, -a]]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - (-i c)(i c) = a² - [ (-i c)(i c) ]

Wait, (-i c) * (i c) = (-i)(i) c² = (i * -i) c² → i*(-i) is (-i²) → which is -(-1) → 1.

So the determinant is a² - c² =0 → a² = c² → a= ± c.

But that implies real eigenvalues, which can't be correct for an anti-hermitian operator. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the matrix setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the matrix S given in the problem is not the same as sigma_y. Let me check the problem statement again.

The operator Ay is c·S, with S being a 2x2 matrix, first row (0 -i), second row (i 0). So S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is exactly sigma_y multiplied by -i. Because sigma_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]? Wait, no, sigma_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]? Let me check. No, the standard sigma matrices are:

sigma_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]

sigma_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]

sigma_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So yes, the S given is sigma_y. Which is hermitian? Wait, sigma_y is hermitian because its conjugate transpose is the same as itself.

Wait, let's compute sigma_y†:

sigma_y† = [[0, i], [-i, 0]]

Which is not the same as sigma_y. Because sigma_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

So sigma_y† = [[0, i], [-i, 0]] = - sigma_y. Because:

-sigma_y is [[0, i], [-i, 0]]

Which is equal to sigma_y†.

So sigma_y is anti-hermitian, not hermitian.

Wait, that can't be right because I thought the Pauli matrices were hermitian. So perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, sigma_y is supposed to be hermitian. Let me check again. The hermitian condition is sigma_y† = sigma_y.

sigma_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

sigma_y† is [[0, i], [-i, 0]]

Is that equal to sigma_y? No. Because the first row is [0, i], which is not the same as [0, -i]. So sigma_y is not hermitian. That's conflicting with what I thought.

Wait, no, I think I must have made a mistake. Because I'm pretty sure sigma_y is hermitian. Let me compute sigma_y^dagger.

Wait, sigma_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

The conjugate transpose (sigma_y^dagger) is [[0, i], [-i, 0]]

Which is not the same as sigma_y. So sigma_y is not hermitian. That can't be correct.

Wait, no, let me check again. Oh wait, perhaps I'm confusing sigma_y with another matrix. Let me make sure.

Wait, sigma matrices are defined as:

sigma_x = [[1,0],[0,-1]]? No, no. sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]

sigma_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]]

sigma_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Wait, so sigma_y is [[0, -i], [i,0]]

So sigma_y^dagger is [[0, i], [-i, 0]]

Which is equal to - sigma_y.

So sigma_y is anti-hermitian, because sigma_y^dagger = - sigma_y.

That's the opposite of what I thought earlier. So S is sigma_y, which is anti-hermitian. Then, A_y = c * S, which is anti-hermitian.

So the eigenvalues should be purely imaginary.

But according to the determinant calculation, the eigenvalues are real, which is a contradiction.

So where is the mistake?

Wait, perhaps the determinant calculation is wrong.

Let me recalculate the determinant of (Ay - a I):

Ay - a I = [[-a, -i c], [i c, -a]]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - (-i c)(i c) = a² - [ (-i c)(i c) ]

Which is a² - [ (-i)(i) c² ] = a² - [ (i*(-i)) c² ]

i*(-i) = -i² = - (-1) = 1.

So determinant is a² - c².

Set to zero: a² - c² =0 → a² = c² → a= ± c.

But that's real, which is not matching the anti-hermitian expectation.

Alternatively, perhaps the definition is different. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps the operator A is defined as A = ħ S, but in this problem, c is h/(4 pi ), which is (2 pi ) * (h/(2 pi )) / (2 pi ) ) → perhaps c is related to the reduced Planck constant.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the units. Let me see: h is Planck's constant (6.626e-34 J s), ħ is h/(2 pi ), approximately 1.05e-34 J s.

In the problem, c is h/(4 pi ), which is ħ / 2.

So c = (h/(2 pi )) / 2 = ħ / 2.

So A_y = (ħ/2) * S.

Since S is anti-hermitian, A_y is (ħ/2) times anti-hermitian, so A_y is anti-hermitian.

So eigenvalues should be imaginary.

Hmm. But according to the calculation, the eigenvalues are real. This suggests a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try another approach. Let's compute the eigenvalues directly.

The matrix A_y is:

[ [0, -i c], [i c, 0] ]

To find the eigenvalues, solve (Ay - a I ) |v> =0.

So the system is:

- a v1 + (-i c) v2 =0

i c v1 - a v2 =0

These two equations must be satisfied.

From the first equation: (-a) v1 + (-i c) v2 =0 → v1 = (i c / a ) v2.

From the second equation: i c v1 - a v2 =0 → substitute v1 from first equation:

i c (i c v2 / a ) - a v2 =0 → (i^2 c² v2 / a ) - a v2 =0 → (- c² v2 / a ) - a v2=0.

Factor out v2:

[ (-c² / a ) - a ] v2 =0.

Assuming v2 ≠0,

→ (-c² / a - a ) =0 → (-c² - a² ) / a =0 → numerator must be zero → -c² -a² =0 → a² = - c² → a= ± i c.

Ah, there's the mistake. Earlier, I thought the determinant was a² - c²=0, but actually, the correct equation is a² = - c².

So the eigenvalues are a = i c and a= -i c.

Which are purely imaginary, as expected for an anti-hermitian operator. So earlier mistake was in the determinant calculation.

Thus, the eigenvalues are a= i c and a= -i c.

So the eigenvalues have zero real parts and imaginary parts ±c.

So the options:

Option A: imaginary parts ±2 pi h, real parts ± h/(4 pi ). 

But our c is h/(4 pi ), so the eigenvalues are ± i h/(4 pi ). So the real parts are zero, which is not what option A says. So A is wrong.

Option B: imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. Doesn't match.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Correct, since A² commutes with A_y.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Correct, because the eigenvectors form a basis.

So the correct statements are C and D. But the options are to choose which statement is correct.

Wait, the question is during the calculation, which statement will you consider correct.

So considering the options, both C and D are correct statements. But since it's a multiple-choice question, only one option can be correct. So perhaps I've made a mistake in evaluating the options.

Wait, looking back, the problem states that the matrix operator is given, and we're to calculate its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

So option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator, which is true because any operator's eigenvectors (if distinct) form a basis for the space.

So all the options, but only one is correct. So perhaps the correct answer is option C and D are both correct, but looking at the options, perhaps only C is correct.

Wait, but the question gives four options, and only one is correct. Let me re-read the options.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Yes, because A² commutes with all components, so they share eigenfunctions. But Az does not commute with Ay, so they can't share eigenfunctions.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay.

Yes, because the eigenvectors form a basis.

So both C and D are correct statements, but the options only allow selecting one. But perhaps in the options, only one is correct.

Wait, let me think about this again.

The problem is about the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. So which statement would be considered correct during that calculation.

Option C is a statement about the relationship between eigenfunctions of Ay and other operators, whereas option D is a statement about the basis.

But perhaps the correct answer is option C because during the calculation, you'd recognize that the eigenfunctions are shared with A² but not Az.

But I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps only option C is correct.

Wait, perhaps looking at the options again.

Option D says the eigenfunctions phi are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. That is, the eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space (which is 2D, so yes, they do). So D is correct.

But the options are presented as separate choices, so perhaps both C and D are correct. But since the options are presented as A, B, C, D, perhaps I have to choose the correct one.

Alternatively, perhaps option C is correct and D is incorrect.

Wait, no. The statement in D is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the operator's space.

So perhaps the correct answer is both C and D, but since the options are presented as four choices, only one can be selected. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Alternatively, the correct answer is option C and D are correct, but the options are presented such that only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

But this is getting complicated. Let me recap the key points:

- The eigenvalues of Ay are ±i c, where c = h/(4 pi )

- The eigenfunctions form a basis (so D is correct)

- The eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² (so C is correct)

So both C and D are correct statements. But the options don't allow for selecting two.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C because it's about the relationship between different operators, which is a key point during the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is D.

But looking back at the problem, the question is during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement is correct.

So when solving for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, one would note that the eigenfunctions form a basis (option D), and that they are eigenfunctions of A² (option C).

But since the options are separate, perhaps the correct answer is option C and D are both correct, but only one option is given as correct.

But the options are mutually exclusive, so perhaps only one of C or D is correct.

Wait, the problem asks which statement is correct, so looking for the correct one.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is correct because in the calculation, the eigenvectors form a basis.

Thus, the correct answer is option C and D. But since only one can be chosen, perhaps D is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options again.

Option C says: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Yes, that's correct because [A_y, A²]=0, but [A_y, Az] ≠0.

Option D says: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay.

Which is correct because the eigenvectors of a matrix form a basis for the vector space (assuming they are linearly independent, which they are here).

So both C and D are correct statements.

But the options are presented as four choices, so perhaps only one is correct.

But the problem gives four options, each as a separate statement, so perhaps more than one is correct, but the user is to select all that apply. However, the question seems to imply a single correct answer.

Given that, perhaps the intended correct answer is option C. Because option D's statement is somewhat trivially true for any matrix, whereas option C makes a specific claim about the eigenfunctions in relation to another operator.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the options again.

The problem is about the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. So during this calculation, which statement is correct.

Option D is a general statement about the eigenfunctions being the basis functions of Ay, which is always true because the eigenvectors form a basis.

So during the calculation, you would consider that the eigenfunctions form a basis, making D correct.

So among the options, the correct statements are C and D. But since the options are mutually exclusive, perhaps the intended correct answer is option C.

But this is getting too confusing. Let me try to make a decision.

The correct eigenvalues are ±i c, which are purely imaginary. So none of the options A or B are correct.

The correct statements are C and D. But since only one can be chosen, perhaps the intended answer is option C.

Wait, but the problem is that the options are presented, and only one is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

But I might have to proceed with the conclusion that option C is correct.


The problem involves calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), which is defined as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Matrix Representation of \( A_y \):**
   Substituting \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \), the operator \( A_y \) becomes:
   \[
   A_y = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \frac{h}{4\pi} \\ i \frac{h}{4\pi} & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   To find the eigenvalues, solve the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - aI) = 0 \):
   \[
   \det\begin{bmatrix} -a & -i \frac{h}{4\pi} \\ i \frac{h}{4\pi} & -a \end{bmatrix} = a^2 - \left(-i \frac{h}{4\pi}\right)\left(i \frac{h}{4\pi}\right) = a^2 - \frac{h^2}{16\pi^2}.
   \]
   Setting this equal to zero gives:
   \[
   a^2 = \frac{h^2}{16\pi^2} \implies a = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi}.
   \]
   Thus, the eigenvalues are \( a = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which are real numbers.

3. **Hermiticity of \( A_y \):**
   The matrix \( S \) is anti-hermitian, as \( S^\dagger = -S \). Since \( A_y = c \cdot S \), \( A_y \) is also anti-hermitian. For an anti-hermitian operator, the eigenvalues should be purely imaginary. This creates a contradiction with the calculated real eigenvalues, suggesting a potential issue in interpreting the hermiticity of \( A_y \).

4. **Eigenvectors and Basis Functions:**
   The eigenvectors of \( A_y \) form a basis for the 2D vector space. This makes **Option D** correct, as the eigenfunctions are indeed the basis functions of \( A_y \).

5. **Relationship with \( A^2 \) and \( A_z \):**
   The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are also eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \). However, \( A_y \) does not commute with \( A_z \), so the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \). This makes **Option C** correct.

### Evaluation of Options:

- **Option A:** Incorrect. The eigenvalues are real (\( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \)), not purely imaginary with imaginary parts \( \pm 2\pi h \).
- **Option B:** Incorrect. The eigenvalues do not match the values given in this option.
- **Option C:** Correct. The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of \( A_z \).
- **Option D:** Correct. The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) form a basis for the operator.

### Conclusion:

Both **Option C** and **Option D** are correct statements. However, since the question requires selecting only one option, **Option C** is the most relevant during the calculation, as it highlights the relationship between \( A_y \) and other operators.
