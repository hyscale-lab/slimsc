Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of electrostatics. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The setup is about an uncharged spherical conductor with a cavity. The conductor has radius R, and the cavity inside has radius r, which is smaller than R. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. So the cavity isn't at the center; it's shifted. Then, they put a small positive charge +q somewhere inside this cavity. 

The question is asking about the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l. Both L and l are greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta. 

The options are four different expressions for E, all involving 1/(4πε₀), which makes sense because that's Coulomb's constant. But the denominators vary.

Hmm, I remember that conductors have some important properties. For one, the charges in a conductor reside on the surface. But here, the conductor is uncharged, so the net charge on it is zero. Wait, but there's a charge inside the cavity. How does that affect things?

Oh right, when there's a charge inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's inner surface will have an induced charge opposite to it. Since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have a charge equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the induced charge on the inner surface. Wait, no, wait. If the conductor is neutral, the inner surface must have a charge -q, and the outer surface +q? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. The charge +q inside the cavity will induce a charge of -q on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor itself has no net charge, the outer surface must have a charge +q. Because the total conductor charge is zero, so inner is -q, so outer must be +q to balance. But wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the conductor's total charge is zero. The inner cavity has +q. So the inner surface of the conductor must have -q to cancel it inside the conductor material. Then the outer surface must have +q, because the conductor's net charge is zero. Wait, no, I think I might be getting confused. Let me think again.

When the conductor is neutral, the charges rearrange such that the inner surface has -q (because the positive charge induces negative charges on the cavity wall), and the outer surface must then have +q to make the total conductor charge zero. Wait, but the conductor was initially neutral, so the sum of inner and outer charges must be zero. If the inner surface has -q, the outer surface must have +q. Wait, no, that would make the total charge +q, which can't be right because the conductor is neutral. Oh wait, no. The conductor's total charge is zero. The inner surface has -q, so the outer surface must have +q, but then the conductor's total charge would be (-q) + (+q) = 0. Oh yes, that makes sense.

Wait, but the conductor is neutral, so the sum of the inner and outer charges is zero. So if the inner surface has -q, the outer surface must have +q, right?

Wait, no, wait. The conductor is neutral in total. So the sum of all charges on the conductor (inner and outer surfaces) must be zero. So if the inner surface has a charge of -q, the outer surface must have +q. Because (-q) + (+q) = 0. But wait, that seems conflicting because the net charge on the conductor is zero, but then the outer surface might carry a charge. Hmm, I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, the conductor's total charge is zero. The charge inside the cavity is +q. So the inner surface of the conductor must have -q to cancel it within the conductor. Then, because the conductor itself is neutral, the outer surface must have a charge of +q to balance the inner's -q. So the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q. Because the inner surface is -q, and the outer is +q, their sum is zero. So that makes sense.

So, the conductor's inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q. Now, what's the electric field outside the conductor?

I remember that the electric field outside a charged conductor is as if the charge were concentrated at the center. So the field outside is given by E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (Q_enclosed) / r², where r is the distance from the center.

Wait, but Q_enclosed in this case would be the total charge on the conductor. But the conductor's net charge is zero, because the inner surface is -q and the outer is +q. So the sum is zero. So the field outside would be zero? That can't be right, because the charge inside the cavity is creating an electric field, but the conductor's own charges rearrange such that their external field is as if the charge were at the center.

Wait, no, wait. The conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q. So the total charge outside is +q, and the field outside is as if that +q were at the center of the conductor. Because, for a spherical conductor, the electric field outside depends only on the total charge enclosed within the Gaussian surface, which in this case would be the outer charge.

So, for a point outside the conductor (since point P is at L > R), the electric field at P should be the same as if all the charge +q were concentrated at the center of the conductor. But wait, the point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center. So the field at P would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / L². But wait, looking at the options, option B is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². But let me think again.

Wait, but the charge inside the cavity is +q, which induces -q on the inner surface and +q on the outer surface. So the conductor as a whole has a net charge of zero. Wait, no. The conductor's net charge is zero. So the inner surface has -q, and the outer has +q, so the conductor's total charge is zero because (-q) + (+q) = 0. So the field outside the conductor would be zero. But that contradicts what I thought earlier.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me think again. If the conductor is neutral, the outer surface has zero net charge. Because the inner surface has -q, the outer must have +q to make the total charge zero. Hmm, no, because the conductor's own net charge is zero, so the inner and outer must sum to zero. So if the inner is -q, the outer is +q, and their sum is zero.

But the presence of the charge inside the cavity affects the distribution of charges on the conductor. The conductor's outer surface will have a charge of +q, because the inner is -q. So the field outside is due to the +q charge.

Wait, but the conductor is a sphere, and for points outside, the field is as if all charge were at the center. So E = (1/(4πε₀)) (q) / L².

But in the options, option B is this. But wait, looking back, the point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and l is the distance from P to the center of the cavity. So the position of the cavity's center (s) might affect the calculation.

Hmm, no, because the charges on the conductor's outer surface distribute themselves spherically symmetrically. So the outer surface's charge is +q, and for points outside, the field is as if it's a point charge at the center of the conductor.

So regardless of where the cavity is, the field outside is E = (1/(4πε₀)) (q) / L². So option B.

Wait, but let me think about the placement of the charge inside the cavity. If the charge is at a different position within the cavity, does that affect the field outside? I think not, because the conductor's outer surface charge is induced based on the cavity's charge, but the distribution is such that the outer surface charge is uniform and spherically symmetric. So the field outside is the same as a point charge q at the center.

Wait, but the cavity's center is offset from the conductor's center by s. So the charge inside the cavity is at a point that's s away from the conductor's center. But when the conductor reacts by inducing charges, the outer surface's charge is +q, and the field outside would be as if that +q were at the center of the conductor. So the distance from P to the conductor's center is L, so E is q/(4πε₀ L²).

So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but let me look at the options again. Option B is (1/(4πε₀)) q / L². That would be the case if the field is from the +q charge at the center. But what if the position of the charge in the cavity affects the field? Since the charge is placed inside the cavity, but the conductor's outer surface behaves as if it's a point charge at the center.

Alternatively, could the field be as if the charge were at the center of the conductor, regardless of its position in the cavity?

Wait, another approach: using Gauss's Law. For a Gaussian surface outside the conductor (radius L), the enclosed charge is the charge on the outer surface, which is +q. So E * 4π L² = q / ε₀. So E = q/(4πε₀ L²), which matches option B.

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer should be option B.

The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity of radius $r$ inside it. The center of the cavity is offset from the center of the conductor by a distance $s$, and a small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity. The goal is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor and a distance $l$ from the center of the cavity. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Conductor Properties**: Since the conductor is neutral, the total charge on it is zero. The charge $+q$ inside the cavity induces a charge of $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor. To maintain neutrality, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge of $+q$.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: For a spherical conductor, the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed within a Gaussian surface. Since the outer surface of the conductor has a charge of $+q$, the electric field outside the conductor is as if the charge $+q$ were concentrated at the center of the conductor.

3. **Gauss's Law**: Using Gauss's law, the electric field at a point outside the conductor is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2},
   \]
   where $L$ is the distance from the center of the conductor to the point $P$. The offset $s$ of the cavity's center and the angle $\theta$ do not affect the field outside the conductor because the outer surface charge distributes spherically symmetrically.

4. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: This expression incorrectly involves the distance $(l - s \cos\theta)$, which is not relevant for the electric field outside the conductor.
   - **Option B**: This matches the derived expression for the electric field outside the conductor, as the field depends only on the total charge $+q$ and the distance $L$.
   - **Option C**: This expression incorrectly involves the distance $(l + s \cos\theta)$, which is not relevant for the electric field outside the conductor.
   - **Option D**: This expression assumes the electric field depends on $l$, the distance from $P$ to the cavity's center, which is incorrect for a point outside the conductor.

### Conclusion:
The electric field at point $P$ is determined solely by the charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
