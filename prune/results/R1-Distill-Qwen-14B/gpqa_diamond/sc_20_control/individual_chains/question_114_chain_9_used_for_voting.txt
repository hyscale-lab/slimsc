Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. It's about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with a reagent A, resulting in 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. I need to pick the correct options from A to D.

Starting with the first reaction: butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is a ketone. NaCN is sodium cyanide. I remember that when ketones react with HCN or its salts, they undergo a cyanohydrin formation. The cyanohydrin reaction typically adds a cyanide and a hydroxyl group to the carbonyl carbon. But under what conditions does this happen? I think the reaction usually uses an acid catalyst. Like, you have a proton source to help the attack. So perhaps H3O+ is involved as reagent A.

Wait, but NaCN is a source of CN- in solution. So if A is H3O+, then the conditions would be acidic, which makes sense because the cyanohydrin formation requires an acid catalyst. Without acid, the reaction might not proceed. So butan-2-one plus NaCN in acidic conditions (H3O+) would form the cyanohydrin, which is what the product shows.

So reaction A is likely H3O+.

Now the second reaction: the starting material is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, no, wait. The second starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So it's a nitrile with a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. The product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group (CN) has been converted into a carboxylic acid (COOH) group.

Hmm, how do you convert a nitrile to a carboxylic acid? I think the typical method is hydrolysis. Under acidic or basic conditions. For nitriles to carboxylic acids, usually, you need strong acidic conditions. Like using HCl (H2SO4 and H2O) or other strong acids. Alternatively, you can use a two-step process where the nitrile is first hydrolyzed to an amide, then further to a carboxylic acid, but in this case, it's a direct conversion.

Wait, but the reagent B is given as H2O. Oh, wait, no, the second reagent is B, which is one of the options. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options: option A says B is HCl, option B says B is CH3COOH, etc.

Wait, the second reaction's product is a carboxylic acid. So the reagent B is the agent that, when H2O is present, causes the conversion of nitrile to carboxylic acid.

Wait, the reaction is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile plus B in H2O leading to 2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So, is B the catalyst or the acid source?

I think converting a nitrile to a carboxylic acid usually requires hydrolysis. The typical reagents are H2O with acid (like HCl) or base (like NaOH). But the presence of a hydroxyl group on the same carbon might influence the reaction conditions.

Wait, the starting material has a hydroxyl group. So in the second reaction, we're adding B (which is HCl or another acid) in H2O. So the conditions are probably acidic hydrolysis.

But wait, another thought: sometimes, nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids using strong acids. For example, using HCl as the catalyst. So if B is HCl, then the reaction would proceed through acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.

Alternatively, another possibility: sometimes, a strong base like NaOH is used, but in that case, the product would be a carboxylate salt, not the acid. So to get the carboxylic acid, you'd need to protonate it, which would require acid work-up.

Wait, but the product is a carboxylic acid. So the reaction must be under acidic conditions. Because if you hydrolyze a nitrile under basic conditions, you get a sodium or potassium salt, which you then acidify to get the carboxylic acid. But in this question, the product is already the acid. So the hydrolysis must have been done under acidic conditions. Hence, reagent B must be HCl, which is a strong acid that provides the H+ for the reaction.

Wait, but looking at the options for reagent B: the options are either HCl or CH3COOH or H3O+ (in case of option C and D, but looking at the options, no, because option C says B is HCl, D says B is CH3COOH.

Looking at the options:

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl → So for first reaction, H3O+ is correct. For second, B is HCl.

Option B: A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH.

Option C: A = NaHSO3, B = HCl.

Option D: A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH.

So if for the first reaction, A is H3O+, then options A and B are possible. For the second reaction, if B is HCl (option A), then that's correct. Alternatively, if B is CH3COOH, which is a weaker acid, would it work?

Wait, the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids usually requires strong acid conditions. I think HCl would be more effective than acetic acid (CH3COOH), which is a weaker acid. So for the second reaction, B is HCl, which points to option A.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes for certain substrates, using a milder acid might be sufficient, but nitriles are generally tough. So probably strong acid is needed, so option A for B.

Putting it together: reagent A is H3O+ (from first reaction), reagent B is HCl (second reaction). So the correct option is A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The first reaction involves the conversion of butan-2-one (a ketone) and NaCN in the presence of reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. This is a cyanohydrin formation reaction, which typically requires an acidic catalyst. Among the options, **H₃O⁺** (option A) is the most suitable reagent for this reaction, as it provides the necessary acidic conditions.

The second reaction involves the conversion of 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This is a hydrolysis reaction where the nitrile group (CN) is converted into a carboxylic acid (COOH). For this transformation, strong acidic conditions are generally required. Among the options, **HCl** (option A) is the most appropriate reagent, as it provides the necessary acidic environment for the hydrolysis to proceed efficiently.

Combining these observations, the correct reagents are **A = H₃O⁺** and **B = HCl**, which corresponds to **option A**.

Answer: A
