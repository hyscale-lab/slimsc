Okay, so I've got this electrochemistry question in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about.

The question says that oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions and …… in acidic solutions. The options are about whether it's stronger or weaker, and faster or slower. Hmm, I remember that in electrochemistry, the strength of an oxidant relates to its standard electrode potential. The higher the potential, the stronger the oxidizing agent.

Oxygen is involved in redox reactions. In basic solutions, the reaction for oxygen as an oxidant is O2 + 2H2O + 4e^- → 4OH^-, right? The standard electrode potential for this reaction is something like 0.401 V. Oh wait, wait, wait—I might be mixing it up. Alternatively, in acidic solution, the reaction is O2 + 4H+ +4e^- → 2H2O, and the standard potential is around 1.23 V. Oh yeah, that's more familiar. So in acidic solution, the oxidizing power is higher because the E° is higher. So in basic solutions, the E° is lower, making oxygen a weaker oxidant there.

Wait, no—wait. So because E° is higher in acidic, oxygen is a stronger oxidant in acidic than in basic. So thermodynamically, in basic solutions, oxygen is a weaker oxidant. Because higher E° means stronger. So in basic, E is lower, so weaker.

Now, what about kinetic aspects? The question is about how fast oxygen reacts in acidic versus basic. Oh, right, kinetics can be influenced by factors like concentration, but in this case, maybe it's about the reaction conditions, like the presence of H+ ions.

In acidic solutions, the reaction might proceed faster because H+ could act as a catalyst or speed up the reaction. Alternatively, maybe the reaction in acidic solution has lower activation energy because of the presence of H+ ions. I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, maybe the reaction in basic has higher pH, which might slow things down because H+ is lower, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: think about the rate of the reaction. In acidic conditions, the solution has more H+ ions. For the oxygen reduction, which is the reaction here, more H+ would likely make the reaction proceed faster because the reaction involves H+ (like in the acidic case, it consumes H+). So if the solution is acidic, the reaction might proceed at a higher rate because the necessary ions are present in higher concentration. Alternatively, maybe the basic solution has OH- which could hinder the reaction, making it slower.

Wait, but that might depend on the specific reaction. The reaction in acidic solution is O2 + 4H+ +4e^- → 2H2O, and in basic it's O2 + 2H2O +4e^- → 4OH^-. So in acidic solution, the H+ is part of the reaction, so when H+ is present, the reaction can proceed more quickly if H+ is available. So, in acidic solutions, the reaction is faster because the necessary ions (H+) are present, making it kinetically faster.

So putting it together: thermodynamically, in basic solutions, oxygen is a weaker oxidant because its E° is lower. Kinetically, in acidic solutions, O2 reacts faster.

Wait, but the statement in the question is: thermodynamically, O is a … oxidant in basic. So the first blank is about strength. Since basic E° is lower, it's a weaker oxidant. So the first part would be weaker.

The second part is about kinetic behavior in acidic. So if the reaction is faster in acidic, it's faster. So the second blank is faster.

Wait but let me think again. The options are about the combination. The question says:

Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions.

So the first part is about strength. Basic: weaker oxidant. The second part is about how it reacts in acidic—faster.

So the first blank is 'weaker' and the second is 'faster'. The options are:

A) stronger – faster

B) stronger – slower

C) weaker – faster

D) weaker - slower

So the correct combination would be weaker and faster. Looking at the options, option C is weaker – faster.

Wait, but wait. The options are phrased as combination of weaker/stronger and faster/slower. So the question says, which combination is correct?

So if in basic, O is weaker (thermodynamic), and in acidic, it reacts faster (kinetic), then the combination is weaker and faster. So the correct option would be C.

Alternatively, maybe I got the kinetic part wrong. Let me think again. In acidic solution, the reaction is O2 + 4H+ + 4e^- → 2H2O. The H+ comes from the solution, so it's a necessary component. So if the solution is acidic, H+ is higher, making the reaction proceed faster. Therefore, in acidic solutions, the reaction is faster.

So the correct combination is weaker (basic) and faster (acidic). So the answer is C.

To determine the correct combination of terms for the given statement, we analyze the thermodynamic and kinetic behavior of oxygen in basic and acidic solutions.

1. **Thermodynamic Behavior**:  
   The standard electrode potential ($E^\circ$) determines the strength of an oxidant. In basic solutions, the reduction reaction of oxygen is:  
   $$ \text{O}_2 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} + 4\text{e}^- \rightarrow 4\text{OH}^- \quad (E^\circ = 0.401 \, \text{V}) $$  
   In acidic solutions, the reaction is:  
   $$ \text{O}_2 + 4\text{H}^+ + 4\text{e}^- \rightarrow 2\text{H}_2\text{O} \quad (E^\circ = 1.23 \, \text{V}) $$  
   Since the $E^\circ$ is higher in acidic solutions, oxygen is a stronger oxidant in acidic solutions and a weaker oxidant in basic solutions.

2. **Kinetic Behavior**:  
   The rate of the reaction depends on the availability of ions involved in the reaction. In acidic solutions, the reaction involves $\text{H}^+$ ions, which are present in higher concentrations, making the reaction proceed faster. In contrast, in basic solutions, the presence of $\text{OH}^-$ ions can slow down the reaction. Therefore, oxygen reacts faster in acidic solutions.

Combining these observations:  
- Thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions.  
- Kinetically, oxygen reacts **faster** in acidic solutions.  

The correct combination is **weaker – faster**, which corresponds to option **C**.

So if in basic, O is weaker (thermodynamic), and in acidic, it reacts faster (kinetic), then the combination is weaker and faster. So the correct option would be C.

Alternatively, maybe I got the kinetic part wrong. Let me think again. In acidic solution, the reaction is O2 + 4H+ + 4e^- → 2H2O. The H+ comes from the solution, so it's a necessary component. So if the solution is acidic, H+ is higher, making the reaction proceed faster. Therefore, in acidic solutions, the reaction is faster.

So the correct combination is weaker (basic) and faster (acidic). So the answer is C.


To determine the correct combination of terms for the given statement, we analyze the thermodynamic and kinetic behavior of oxygen in basic and acidic solutions.

1. **Thermodynamic Behavior**:  
   The standard electrode potential ($E^\circ$) determines the strength of an oxidant. In basic solutions, the reduction reaction of oxygen is:  
   $$ \text{O}_2 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} + 4\text{e}^- \rightarrow 4\text{OH}^- \quad (E^\circ = 0.401 \, \text{V}) $$  
   In acidic solutions, the reaction is:  
   $$ \text{O}_2 + 4\text{H}^+ + 4\text{e}^- \rightarrow 2\text{H}_2\text{O} \quad (E^\circ = 1.23 \, \text{V}) $$  
   Since the $E^\circ$ is higher in acidic solutions, oxygen is a stronger oxidant in acidic solutions and a weaker oxidant in basic solutions.

2. **Kinetic Behavior**:  
   The rate of the reaction depends on the availability of ions involved in the reaction. In acidic solutions, the reaction involves $\text{H}^+$ ions, which are present in higher concentrations, making the reaction proceed faster. In contrast, in basic solutions, the presence of $\text{OH}^-$ ions can slow down the reaction. Therefore, oxygen reacts faster in acidic solutions.

Combining these observations:  
- Thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions.  
- Kinetically, oxygen reacts **faster** in acidic solutions.  

The correct combination is **weaker – faster**, which corresponds to option **C**.
