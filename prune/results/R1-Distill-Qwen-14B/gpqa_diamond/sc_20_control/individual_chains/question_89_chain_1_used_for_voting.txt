Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because these reaction mechanisms can be tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, like a cage-like molecule. The 1,3-dibromo suggests that there are two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in the structure. When heated with KOH, I think this is an elimination reaction, probably forming an alkene. Wait, because KOH is a strong base, it's likely an E2 mechanism. So, each bromine is on a different carbon, and the base would abstract a beta hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond between those two carbons.

So product 1 would be 1,3-adamantadiene. But wait, checking the NMR data: the 1H NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's a high chemical shift, maybe around where an ether or an alcohol would be. Wait, but elimination would give an alkene, which usually has protons around 4-6 ppm if they're on the double bond. Hmm, but 4.79 is a bit downfield for a vinyl proton. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide? Because epoxide protons are around 3-4 ppm, but some can be a bit upfield. Wait, no, wait. Wait, product 1's IR showed a characteristic absorbance at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So maybe the product isn't an alkene but something else.

Oh wait, perhaps I messed up. Heating with KOH—maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but if two bromines are present, perhaps it's a di-elimination. Alternatively, maybe it's more likely to form a carbonyl group. Wait, elimination of two HBr molecules from adjacent bromides might form a conjugated diene, but for 1,3-dibromoadamantane, maybe the structure is such that elimination leads to a cyclopropane ring or another structure. Alternatively, I'm getting confused here.

Wait, the product after KOH is a light yellow solid, which makes me think of some kind of oxide. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide. Because when two alkyl halides undergo elimination with a strong base, they can form an epoxide. Oh wait! That's right—epoxidation. If we have two vicinal dihalides, treatment with a base like KOH can form an epoxide. Wait, vicinal dihalide means the two Xs are on adjacent carbons. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane is not a vicinal dihalide, because 1 and 3 are separated by one carbon in adamantane. Wait, does the structure of adamantane have 1 and 3 adjacent? Hmm, I'm not exactly sure about the structure, but perhaps in this case, the elimination leads to an epoxide.

Wait, but if it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, then the bromines are on carbons that are two apart. So elimination might form a double bond between 1 and 2, and another between 3 and 4, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the structure allows for the formation of an epoxide by ring closure. Wait, maybe the product is a bicyclic structure with an epoxide.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone. How? If each Br is on a secondary carbon, and KOH abstracts a beta hydrogen, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. Wait, but for each Br, elimination would produce a carbonyl. But wait, 1,3-dibromide would have two Brs on different carbons, so perhaps two eliminations happen, but that would require two KOH molecules. Alternatively, maybe each Br undergoes elimination to form a carbonyl group. So, perhaps each elimination forms a carbonyl, making a diketone?

Wait, but considering the IR, the 1720 cm^-1 is consistent with a carbonyl. So maybe product 1 is a diketone. But wait, the NMR shows 4.79 ppm for 2H. Hmm, maybe that's a ketone with a neighboring group, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the product is an ether, but then the IR wouldn't have a strong C=O peak.

Wait, perhaps I'm thinking about this wrong. Maybe the reaction is not elimination but substitution. But with two Brs, perhaps it's a double substitution. But then, substitution of two Brs with two hydroxide groups would give 1,3-diol. But that doesn't explain the IR peak at 1720. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl. Wait, if you have two adjacent Brs and eliminate two HBr molecules, perhaps that forms a double bond, but if the starting material is 1,3-dibromide, perhaps elimination leads to a conjugated diene. But the IR doesn't show a peak for C=C, which is usually around 1650 cm^-1. The given IR is 1720, which is more like a ketone or ester.

Hmm. Let me think again. Starting material: 1,3-dibromoadamantane. KOH is a strong base. When vicinal dihalides (two adjacent Brs) react with a strong base, they can form an epoxide. But if the Brs are not adjacent, maybe it's a different scenario.

Wait another angle: The product's NMR shows 4.79 ppm for 2H. Let's consider that. So two protons as a singlet? Or maybe a doublet? But 4.79 is around where vinyl protons are, but perhaps they're part of an epoxide. Alternatively, an epoxide's protons are usually around 3.5-4.5, maybe a triplet or quartet due to coupling with adjacent protons. But in an epoxide, each proton is adjacent to two others, so maybe a triplet of triplets? Alternatively, maybe it's an acetal or something else.

Wait, but the IR definitely shows a carbonyl. So maybe it's a ketone. Let's imagine that each Br is on a carbon adjacent to a bridgehead. So, eliminating HBr from each bridgehead would form a ketone. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing the formation of a ketone via elimination. For example, if each Br is on a carbon that can form a carbonyl upon elimination. So, each Br is on a carbon that can lose HBr and form a carbonyl. So, perhaps 1,3-dibromoadamantane upon heating with KOH forms 1,3-adamantanedione.

If that's the case, the product would have two ketone groups. But then the NMR would show more signals, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps one elimination occurs, but I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, another thought: Maybe it's a Claisen or Aldol-like condensation, but that's more for carbonyl-containing compounds.

Wait, perhaps the product is an epoxide but with a carbonyl group elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe the product is a diketone, which would have a strong C=O peak.

But then the NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. Let's think about that. If it's a ketone, the neighboring protons (like on the alpha carbon) could be deshielded. For example, in acetone, the methyl protons are around 2.1 ppm, but that's not our case.

Alternatively, maybe the 4.79 ppm is due to an oxygen-bearing proton, like in an epoxide ring. So, in an epoxide, the protons are usually in the 3-4 ppm range, but perhaps in a more deshielded environment, they could be upfield or downfield.

Wait, maybe the product is a cyclopropane ring. But I'm not sure how that would form from KOH.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a carbonyl. Let's think about the structure. Suppose each Br is eliminated, and each elimination forms a carbonyl group. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules, forming a conjugated carbonyl system. Like, forming two ketone groups. But then, the molecule would have two carbonyls.

But the NMR shows 2H at 4.79, which is a bit high. Let me think about the coupling. If two H are split into a triplet, perhaps they're each coupled to two others. Or maybe it's a doublet of triplets or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the 4.79 ppm is due to a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen. For example, an ether group.

Wait, let's think about the IR again. 1720 cm^-1 is a strong C=O peak. So, product 1 is likely a carbonyl-containing compound. So, maybe it's a diketone.

So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules, each elimination forming a carbonyl group. So, the product would be 1,3-adamantanedione.

In that case, the structure would have two ketone groups. Then, the NMR would show the protons adjacent to the carbonyls. For example, the protons on carbons adjacent to the ketones. So, those would be deshielded. But in adamantane, each bridgehead is a quaternary carbon, so maybe the protons are on the adjacent carbons.

Wait, but the NMR shows 4.79 ppm for 2H. Maybe those are the two protons adjacent to each ketone group. Each ketone has two CH2 groups next to it. Wait, but in adamantane, each bridgehead is connected to two CH2 groups.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is such that after elimination, there are two CH2 groups each adjacent to a carbonyl. So, each of those CH2 groups would have protons around 2.2-2.4 ppm, but that's not matching 4.79.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe product 1 isn't a diketone but something else. Let's think about the reaction conditions again: KOH is a strong base, and it's heated at 240°C, which suggests elimination is more likely than substitution.

So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1.

Wait, maybe it's a ring-opening of some sort. Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-elimination to form a diene. But then the IR wouldn't have a C=O peak. So that's conflicting.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the KOH is dehydrohalogenating each Br to form a carbonyl group. So, each Br is eliminated as HBr, and the adjacent carbons form carbonyls. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane → 1,3-adamantanedione.

So product 1 is 1,3-adamantanedione. Then, what's the NMR? The 4.79 ppm for 2H would then be the protons next to the ketones. Wait, but in 1,3-adamantanedione, the carbons adjacent to the ketones are each connected to two CH2 groups. But wait, in adamantane, each bridgehead is connected to two CH2 groups, but if the bridgeheads are now carbonyls, perhaps the structure is such that the CH2 groups are next to the carbonyls.

In that case, the protons on CH2 groups next to ketones are usually in the 2.1-2.5 ppm region. But 4.79 is much higher. Hmm, maybe that's not it.

Wait, perhaps the 4.79 ppm is from an ether or an epoxide. Alternatively, maybe the product is a cyclic ether, like an epoxide.

Wait, let me think about when two vicinal dihalides (adjacent Brs) react with a base to form an epoxide. So, for example, 1,2-dibromoethane with KOH forms epoxide. But our starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, meaning the Brs are on carbons 1 and 3, which are not adjacent. So, perhaps the formation of an epoxide isn't straightforward here.

Wait, perhaps the structure of adamantane allows the 1 and 3 positions to be adjacent in some way. Because adamantane is a polycyclic structure, perhaps the 1 and 3 positions are actually on adjacent carbons in a bridge structure. So, maybe they are vicinal. If that's the case, then elimination could form an epoxide.

In that scenario, product 1 would be an epoxide. The IR would then show an epoxide's C-O-C stretching, which is around 1200-1300 cm^-1. But the given IR is 1720 cm^-1, which is a C=O stretch. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, so perhaps product 1 is a ketone and an epoxide in the same molecule? But that seems a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction produces a ketone, and then another reaction occurs. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a diol, but that doesn't fit the IR data.

Wait, let me think again. The IR 1720 cm^-1 is a strong absorption, likely a carbonyl. So product 1 must have a carbonyl group.

Let me think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane has a structure similar to a diamond, with multiple bridgehead carbons. Each bridgehead is a quaternary carbon connected to two other bridgeheads and two CH2 groups.

So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on two bridgehead carbons that are separated by one bridge. When KOH is added, perhaps each Br undergoes elimination, but how?

Wait, each bridgehead is connected to two CH2 groups. So, if each Br is on a bridgehead, then eliminating HBr from each would form a carbonyl group. So, the bridgehead becomes a ketone.

So, product 1 would be 1,3-adamantanedione, with two ketone groups on the bridgeheads.

Now, looking at the NMR data for product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H).

The 4.79 ppm is a sharp peak for 2H. Maybe those are the protons adjacent to the carbonyl groups. Wait, but in 1,3-adamantanedione, the carbons next to the ketones (the CH2 groups) would have protons in the 2.2-2.4 ppm range. So why is there a peak at 4.79?

Hmm, that doesn't fit. Maybe the 4.79 is from another group, perhaps an epoxide? Or maybe it's an exchangeable proton, but the question says to exclude those.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the product isn't a diketone but a cyclic ketone. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the initial reaction forms a gem-diol, but that doesn't seem right either.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't a di-elimination but a mono-elimination. So, only one Br is eliminated, forming a carbonyl and leaving the other Br as is. But that wouldn't explain the IR peak, which is a strong C=O. Plus, product 1 is a solid, which might not fit if it's a mono-substituted compound.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should move on to product 2 and see if that helps.

Product 1 is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide upon heating. Aluminum isopropoxide (Al(i-Pr)3) is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation reactions. But product 1 is a carbonyl-containing compound, possibly a diketone. So, perhaps product 1 undergoes some kind of Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but I don't see an aromatic ring here. Alternatively, maybe it's undergoing a ketone alkylation, but that's not common.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and aluminum isopropoxide is used in ring-opening reactions. Epoxides can react with acids to form carbocation intermediates. So, if product 1 is an epoxide, then heating with Al(i-Pr)3 would protonate the epoxide, leading to ring-opening.

Wait, but product 1's IR doesn't match an epoxide. Unless the initial product was an epoxide, but then the IR would have a peak around 1250 cm^-1 for the C-O stretch. But the IR is 1720, which is more like a ketone.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 isn't a ketone but an ester or something else. But I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a ketone, and when treated with Al(i-Pr)3, it undergoes some kind of acylation. But I'm not clear on what that would be.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and product 2 is formed via ring-opening. Let's imagine product 1 is an epoxide. Then, product 2 would be the ring-opened product, maybe a diol or some other structure.

But without knowing what product 1 is, it's hard to proceed. Let me try to think of another approach.

The reaction steps: product 1 → product 2 with Al(i-Pr)3, then product 2 is ozonolyzed to product 3.

Ozonolysis of a diene typically breaks the double bond and forms carbonyl groups. The coupling pattern in product 3's NMR would depend on the structure of product 2, specifically the diene.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a diene because ozonolysis is done on it. So, product 3 comes from ozonolysis of product 2, which is a diene.

So, working backwards:

Product 3 is formed after ozonolysis and workup. The most deshielded proton in product 3's NMR is in question.

In ozonolysis, a diene is cleaved into carbonyl compounds. For example, a 1,3-diene would break into two carbonyls. But if the diene is in a ring or has substituents, the resulting carbonyl groups would have adjacent protons.

Wait, let's think about the coupling. The most deshielded proton would be near an electronegative group, like a carbonyl. In such cases, the protons adjacent to carbonyls are deshielded. The coupling pattern depends on the neighboring protons.

If the diene in product 2 is symmetric or has equivalent protons, the splitting could be more complex.

Alternatively, let's think about the diene in product 2. Suppose it's a conjugated diene, perhaps a 1,3-diene. Upon ozonolysis, it would break into two carbonyl groups. Each end would have a carbonyl, and if there were substituents, their protons would be adjacent to the carbonyl.

Wait, but the most deshielded proton would be on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl. The coupling would depend on the number of neighboring protons.

For example, if a proton is next to a CH2 group (two protons), it would split into a triplet. Or if adjacent to a CH group (one proton), a doublet.

Wait, perhaps the diene in product 2 is such that when ozonolyzed, each carbonyl is adjacent to a CH2 group. Then, those CH2 protons would be split by their neighboring protons.

Wait, maybe product 2 is a substituted cyclopropane? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a bridged bicyclic diene.

But without knowing product 2, it's hard to tell. Let me try to go back.

Product 1 is a light yellow solid, perhaps a ketone. Then product 2 is formed by a Friedel-Crafts-like reaction. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and product 2 is the ring-opened diol. But then ozonolysis wouldn't make sense for a diol.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and product 2 is a diol. Then, product 2 is treated with ozone. Wait, ozone reacts with double bonds, not with diols. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, product 2 might have a double bond, so when ozone is bubbled, it breaks the double bond.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, product 2 is a diol, but then product 2 doesn't have a double bond. That doesn't fit.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think of each step and possible products.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH (excess) → product 1.

Assuming elimination, perhaps we form an epoxide. Let's say product 1 is adamantane epoxide.

Then, step 2: product 1 + Al(i-Pr)3 (excess) → product 2.

Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid. Epoxides can react with Lewis acids to form carbocation intermediates, leading to ring-opening. So, product 2 could be an alcohol or a diol.

Wait, but with Al(i-Pr)3, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But product 1 is an epoxide, which isn't an aromatic compound. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a dienol ether or something else. I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether formed via some kind of elimination.

Wait, another thought: Maybe product 1 is a diketone, and product 2 is formed via a Dieckmann cyclization. Wait, Dieckmann cyclization is for esters, though, not ketones. So that's probably not it.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is formed via a [2+2] cycloaddition or some other reaction, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol. Wait, but the IR of product 1 has a C=O peak, so that's not it.

Hmm, perhaps I should proceed without fully solving the first steps.

Assuming product 2 is a diene, then ozonolysis would cleave the diene into two carbonyl compounds. The structure of product 2 would determine the structure of product 3.

Ozonolysis of a diene typically gives carbonyls. For example, if product 2 is a 1,3-diene, ozonolysis would give two ketones. But if the diene is part of a ring, like cyclopropane, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls.

Wait, but if product 2 is a conjugated diene, like 1,3-butadiene, ozonolysis would give two aldehydes. But in our case, product 3's NMR would have protons adjacent to carbonyls.

The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded proton in product 3. The deshielded protons would be near a carbonyl group because that's where the electron density is lower, making the protons more deshielded and appear downfield.

The possible options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

So, the proton in question is split by neighboring protons. Let's imagine that the proton is adjacent to another set of protons. For example, if it's next to a CH2 group, which has two protons, the coupling would lead to a triplet. But if the CH2 is itself next to another CH2, perhaps more splitting occurs.

Alternatively, if the proton is next to a CH group, which is next to another CH group, the splitting could be more complex.

Wait, let me think of a specific example. Suppose product 3 has a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. Then, the protons on the CH2 groups would be adjacent to two protons on the neighboring CH2, leading to a triplet. But wait, each CH2 group would have protons that are split by the adjacent CH2's two protons. So, each proton would see two neighboring protons, leading to a triplet.

But in that case, all the CH2 protons would be triplets.

But the question asks about the most deshielded proton. Maybe it's a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl. For example, O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, but wait, that's a four-carbon chain. Alternatively, suppose product 3 has a structure where a proton is adjacent to two different groups, each with their own protons.

Wait, another scenario: product 2 is a bicyclic diene, and upon ozonolysis, it forms two carbonyl groups connected by some structure. For example, if product 2 is bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyls, giving two ketones. But then, the resulting structure would have protons adjacent to the carbonyls.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 has a structure where each carbonyl is connected to a CH2 group, which is adjacent to another CH group. For example, O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-C=O. So, the CH2 group would have two protons, each coupling with the neighboring CH's protons.

Wait, maybe the most deshielded proton is on a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl. Let's say it's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. So, each CH2 proton would be split by the adjacent CH2's two protons, leading to a triplet.

But if the CH2 is next to another CH2, which is in turn next to another CH2, the splitting could be more complex.

Wait, another approach: the most deshielded proton would be on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group. Let's say it's a CH2 next to a carbonyl. Each H on CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs on the next CH2 group. So each H would be split into a triplet. Alternatively, if the CH2 is next to a CH group, which has another CH, the splitting could be more.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the proton is adjacent to two different types of neighboring protons. For example, one adjacent CH2 and another adjacent CH. That could lead to more splitting.

Alternatively, if the proton is next to a CH2 group (two H) and another CH group (one H), the splitting would be a triplet of triplets. Because each proton would couple with two from one group and one from another, leading to 2+1 = 3, so 3x3=9 peaks, which simplifies to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but in the options, triplet of triplets is option B, and doublet of triplets is C. So, which is more likely?

Alternatively, maybe the proton is adjacent to two different sets of protons. For example, one set with two protons and another set with one proton. So, each proton would be split by two (from one neighbor) and one (from another), leading to (n+1)(m+1) = (2+1)(1+1) = 3*2=6, which would be a triplet of doublets or a doublet of triplets, depending on the order.

Wait, but the options include triplet of triplets and doublet of triplets. Let me think of the scenario where a proton is adjacent to two sets of two protons each. For example, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, then each CH2 proton would be adjacent to two others on the same CH2 and two on the neighboring CH2. Wait no, each CH2 proton is adjacent to two others on the same CH2, but the neighboring CH2's protons are two away, so they might not split in the same way. Wait, in vicinal coupling, the coupling is between adjacent protons, so perhaps each CH2 group's protons are split by the neighboring CH2's protons.

Wait, in ethyl groups, the CH2CH3 protons show as a quartet because each H on the first CH2 is split by the two H on the adjacent CH2. Similarly, in a longer chain, the splitting can be more complex.

But in our case, perhaps the most deshielded proton is on a CH2 next to a carbonyl, which is adjacent to another CH2. So, each H on the first CH2 would be split by the two H on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is next to a CH group, which is next to another CH2, the splitting could be more complex. For example, each H on the first CH2 is split by two from the adjacent CH2 (triplet) and perhaps another split from the CH group.

Wait, but if the H is on a CH group, adjacent to a CH2 group and a carbonyl, then each H would couple with the two H on the adjacent CH2 and perhaps another H on the same carbon if it's a CH2.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the most deshielded H is on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl and next to a CH group. So, each H on the CH2 would split into a triplet due to the two H on the adjacent CH group, and perhaps doublet due to another coupling.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think of a simple case where a CH2 group is next to a carbonyl. The H on CH2 would be split by the adjacent CH2's two H, giving a triplet. So, the coupling pattern would be a triplet, which is option A.

But the options also include more complex patterns like triplet of triplets, etc. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded H is on a CH group, adjacent to a CH2 and another CH group. So, each H would split into a triplet due to the two H on the adjacent CH2, and also split by another H on the next CH group, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not sure. Another approach: think about the number of neighboring Hs.

If a proton has two neighboring Hs on one side and two on the other, the splitting could be a quartet. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded H is on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl and next to a CH2 group that is itself adjacent to another CH2. So, each H on the first CH2 would be split by the two H on the next CH2, leading to a triplet.

But if the next CH2 is also adjacent to another CH2, the splitting could be more. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each H is coupled with two H on one side and another two H on the other side, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible answers.

The options are:

A) triplet

B) triplet of triplets

C) doublet of triplets

D) pentet

If the proton is next to two sets of two H each, the splitting would be (2+1)*(2+1) = 9, which is a triplet of triplets. So that would be option B.

Alternatively, if the proton is next to a CH2 (two H) and a CH (one H), the splitting would be (2+1)*(1+1) = 6, which could be a triplet of doublets or a doublet of triplets, depending on the order. So, that would be option C.

But how to decide which scenario is more likely.

If product 3 has a structure where the most deshielded H is on a CH2 group, and that CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 group, then each H would be split into a triplet. So, option A.

Alternatively, if the structure is such that the H is on a CH group adjacent to two CH2 groups, each with two H, then the splitting would be more complex.

Wait, perhaps the ozonolysis product has a structure where each carbonyl is connected to a CH2 group, which is adjacent to another CH2 group. For example, O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. Each CH2's H would be split by the two H on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

But in that case, all the CH2 H would be triplets. The most deshielded would be the H next to the carbonyl, which would be a triplet.

Alternatively, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-C=O, then the H on CH2 would be split by two H on the adjacent CH, leading to a triplet. The H on CH would be split by the two H on CH2 (triplet) and perhaps others.

But the most deshielded H would be on the CH2 next to the carbonyl, which would be a triplet.

So, perhaps the correct answer is A) triplet.

But wait, another possibility: the ozonolysis could break a conjugated diene into two ketones, each with a CH2 group adjacent. So, the product would have two CH2 groups next to the ketones.

In that case, each CH2's H would be split by the adjacent CH2's two H, making a triplet. So, the most deshielded H would be a triplet.

So, the answer would be A) triplet.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the splitting is more complex.

Wait, if the diene in product 2 is part of a ring, like a cyclopropane, then ozonolysis might break it into two carbonyl groups connected by a bridge. The resulting structure could have a CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl and perhaps another CH group.

In that case, the H on the CH2 would be split by the adjacent CH group's H (doublet) and possibly another set.

Hmm, this is getting too speculative. I think the most straightforward answer is that the coupling is a triplet, so option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Step 1: Reaction with KOH**  
   Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH likely involves elimination of two HBr molecules due to the strong base. This forms a carbonyl-containing compound, consistent with the IR absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹, which indicates a C=O stretch. The most plausible product is 1,3-adamantanedione, a diketone.

2. **Step 2: Reaction with Al(i-Pr)₃**  
   Aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid, is used here. While the exact reaction mechanism is unclear, it likely facilitates further transformation of the diketone. However, the exact structure of product 2 is not explicitly determined.

3. **Step 3: Ozonolysis of Product 2**  
   Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl compounds. If product 2 contains a conjugated diene, ozonolysis would break the double bond, forming two carbonyl groups. The resulting product 3 would have protons adjacent to carbonyl groups, which are deshielded and appear downfield in the NMR spectrum.

4. **Analysis of the Most Deshielded Proton in Product 3**  
   The most deshielded proton in product 3 is likely on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group. The coupling pattern depends on the number of neighboring protons:
   - If the proton is adjacent to a CH₂ group (two protons), it would split into a triplet.
   - If the proton is adjacent to multiple sets of protons, more complex splitting patterns (e.g., triplet of triplets or doublet of triplets) could arise.

5. **Evaluation of Options**  
   - **A) Triplet**: This occurs if the proton is adjacent to a CH₂ group with two protons.  
   - **B) Triplet of triplets**: This would require the proton to couple with two sets of two protons each.  
   - **C) Doublet of triplets**: This would occur if the proton couples with one proton from one group and two protons from another.  
   - **D) Pentet**: This would require coupling with four equivalent protons, which is less likely in this scenario.

Given the structure of product 3 and the most probable coupling environment, the most deshielded proton is expected to exhibit a **triplet** pattern due to coupling with two protons on an adjacent CH₂ group.

ANSWER: A

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because these reaction mechanisms can be tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, like a cage-like molecule. The 1,3-dibromo suggests that there are two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in the structure. When heated with KOH, I think this is an elimination reaction, probably forming an alkene. Wait, because KOH is a strong base, it's likely an E2 mechanism. So, each bromine is on a different carbon, and the base would abstract a beta hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond between those two carbons.

So product 1 would be 1,3-adamantadiene. But wait, checking the NMR data: the 1H NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's a high chemical shift, maybe around where an ether or an alcohol would be. Wait, but elimination would give an alkene, which usually has protons around 4-6 ppm if they're on the double bond. Hmm, but 4.79 is a bit downfield for a vinyl proton. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide? Because epoxide protons are around 3-4 ppm, but some can be a bit upfield. Wait, no, wait. Wait, product 1's IR showed a characteristic absorbance at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So maybe the product isn't an alkene but something else.

Oh wait, perhaps I messed up. Heating with KOH—maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but if two bromines are present, perhaps it's a di-elimination. Alternatively, maybe it's more likely to form a carbonyl group. Wait, elimination of two HBr molecules from adjacent bromides might form a conjugated diene, but for 1,3-dibromoadamantane, maybe the structure is such that elimination leads to a cyclopropane ring or another structure. Alternatively, I'm getting confused here.

Wait, the product after KOH is a light yellow solid, which makes me think of some kind of oxide. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide. Because when two alkyl halides undergo elimination with a strong base, they can form an epoxide. Oh wait! That's right—epoxidation. If we have two vicinal dihalides, treatment with a base like KOH can form an epoxide. Wait, vicinal dihalide means the two Xs are on adjacent carbons. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane is not a vicinal dihalide, because 1 and 3 are separated by one carbon in adamantane. Wait, does the structure of adamantane have 1 and 3 adjacent? Hmm, I'm not exactly sure about the structure, but perhaps in this case, the elimination leads to an epoxide.

Wait, but if it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, then the bromines are on carbons that are two apart. So elimination might form a double bond between 1 and 2, and another between 3 and 4, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the structure allows for the formation of an epoxide by ring closure. Wait, maybe the product is a bicyclic structure with an epoxide.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone. How? If each Br is on a secondary carbon, and KOH abstracts a beta hydrogen, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. Wait, but for each Br, elimination would produce a carbonyl. But wait, 1,3-dibromide would have two Brs on different carbons, so perhaps two eliminations happen, but that would require two KOH molecules. Alternatively, maybe each Br undergoes elimination to form a carbonyl group. So, perhaps each elimination forms a carbonyl, making a diketone?

Wait, but considering the IR, the 1720 cm^-1 is consistent with a carbonyl. So maybe product 1 is a diketone. But wait, the NMR shows 4.79 ppm for 2H. Hmm, maybe that's a ketone with a neighboring group, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the product is an ether, but then the IR wouldn't have a strong C=O peak.

Wait, perhaps I'm thinking about this wrong. Maybe the reaction is not elimination but substitution. But with two Brs, perhaps it's a double substitution. But then, substitution of two Brs with two hydroxide groups would give 1,3-diol. But that doesn't explain the IR peak at 1720. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl. Wait, if you have two adjacent Brs and eliminate two HBr molecules, perhaps that forms a double bond, but if the starting material is 1,3-dibromide, perhaps elimination leads to a conjugated diene. But the IR doesn't show a peak for C=C, which is usually around 1650 cm^-1. The given IR is 1720, which is more like a ketone or ester.

Hmm. Let me think again. Starting material: 1,3-dibromoadamantane. KOH is a strong base. When vicinal dihalides (two adjacent Brs) react with a strong base, they can form an epoxide. But if the Brs are not adjacent, maybe it's a different scenario.

Wait another angle: The product's NMR shows 4.79 ppm for 2H. Let's consider that. So two protons as a singlet? Or maybe a doublet? But 4.79 is around where vinyl protons are, but perhaps they're part of an epoxide. Alternatively, an epoxide's protons are usually around 3.5-4.5, maybe a triplet or quartet due to coupling with adjacent protons. But in an epoxide, each proton is adjacent to two others, so maybe a triplet of triplets? Alternatively, maybe it's an acetal or something else.

Wait, but the IR definitely shows a carbonyl. So maybe it's a ketone. Let's imagine that each Br is on a carbon adjacent to a bridgehead. So, eliminating HBr from each bridgehead would form a ketone. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing the formation of a ketone via elimination. For example, if each Br is on a carbon that can form a carbonyl upon elimination. So, each Br is on a carbon that can lose HBr and form a carbonyl. So, perhaps 1,3-dibromoadamantane upon heating with KOH forms 1,3-adamantanedione.

If that's the case, the product would have two ketone groups. But then the NMR would show more signals, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps one elimination occurs, but I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, another thought: Maybe it's a Claisen or Aldol-like condensation, but that's more for carbonyl-containing compounds.

Wait, perhaps the product is an epoxide but with a carbonyl group elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe the product is a diketone, which would have a strong C=O peak.

But then the NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. Let's think about that. If it's a ketone, the neighboring protons (like on the alpha carbon) could be deshielded. For example, in acetone, the methyl protons are around 2.1 ppm, but that's not our case.

Alternatively, maybe the 4.79 ppm is due to an oxygen-bearing proton, like in an epoxide ring. So, in an epoxide, the protons are usually in the 3-4 ppm range, but perhaps in a more deshielded environment, they could be upfield or downfield.

Wait, maybe the product is a cyclopropane ring. But I'm not sure how that would form from KOH.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a carbonyl. Let's think about the structure. Suppose each Br is eliminated, and each elimination forms a carbonyl group. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules, forming a conjugated carbonyl system. Like, forming two ketone groups. But then, the molecule would have two carbonyls.

But the NMR shows 2H at 4.79, which is a bit high. Let me think about the coupling. If two H are split into a triplet, perhaps they're each coupled to two others. Or maybe it's a doublet of triplets or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the 4.79 ppm is due to a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen. For example, an ether group.

Wait, let's think about the IR again. 1720 cm^-1 is a strong C=O peak. So, product 1 is likely a carbonyl-containing compound. So, maybe it's a diketone.

So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules, each elimination forming a carbonyl group. So, the product would be 1,3-adamantanedione.

In that case, the structure would have two ketone groups. Then, the NMR would show the protons adjacent to the carbonyls. For example, the protons on carbons adjacent to the ketones. So, those would be deshielded. But in adamantane, each bridgehead is a quaternary carbon, so maybe the protons are on the adjacent carbons.

Wait, but the NMR shows 4.79 ppm for 2H. Maybe those are the two protons adjacent to each ketone group. Each ketone has two CH2 groups next to it. Wait, but in adamantane, each bridgehead is connected to two CH2 groups.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is such that after elimination, there are two CH2 groups each adjacent to a carbonyl. So, each of those CH2 groups would have protons around 2.2-2.4 ppm, but that's not matching 4.79.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe product 1 isn't a diketone but something else. Let's think about the reaction conditions again: KOH is a strong base, and it's heated at 240°C, which suggests elimination is more likely than substitution.

So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1.

Wait, maybe it's a ring-opening of some sort. Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-elimination to form a diene. But then the IR wouldn't have a C=O peak. So that's conflicting.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the KOH is dehydrohalogenating each Br to form a carbonyl group. So, each Br is eliminated as HBr, and the adjacent carbons form carbonyls. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane → 1,3-adamantanedione.

So product 1 is 1,3-adamantanedione. Then, what's the NMR? The 4.79 ppm for 2H would then be the protons next to the ketones. Wait, but in 1,3-adamantanedione, the carbons adjacent to the ketones are each connected to two CH2 groups. But wait, in adamantane, each bridgehead is connected to two CH2 groups, but if the bridgeheads are now carbonyls, perhaps the structure is such that the CH2 groups are next to the carbonyls.

In that case, the protons on CH2 groups next to ketones are usually in the 2.1-2.5 ppm region. But 4.79 is much higher. Hmm, maybe that's not it.

Wait, perhaps the 4.79 ppm is from an ether or an epoxide. Alternatively, maybe the product is a cyclic ether, like an epoxide.

Wait, let me think about when two vicinal dihalides (adjacent Brs) react with a base to form an epoxide. So, for example, 1,2-dibromoethane with KOH forms epoxide. But our starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, meaning the Brs are on carbons 1 and 3, which are not adjacent. So, perhaps the formation of an epoxide isn't straightforward here.

Wait, perhaps the structure of adamantane allows the 1 and 3 positions to be adjacent in some way. Because adamantane is a polycyclic structure, perhaps the 1 and 3 positions are actually on adjacent carbons in a bridge structure. So, maybe they are vicinal. If that's the case, then elimination could form an epoxide.

In that scenario, product 1 would be an epoxide. The IR would then show an epoxide's C-O-C stretching, which is around 1200-1300 cm^-1. But the given IR is 1720 cm^-1, which is a C=O stretch. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, so perhaps product 1 is a ketone and an epoxide in the same molecule? But that seems a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction produces a ketone, and then another reaction occurs. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a diol, but that doesn't fit the IR data.

Wait, let me think again. The IR 1720 cm^-1 is a strong absorption, likely a carbonyl. So product 1 must have a carbonyl group.

Let me think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane has a structure similar to a diamond, with multiple bridgehead carbons. Each bridgehead is a quaternary carbon connected to two other bridgeheads and two CH2 groups.

So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on two bridgehead carbons that are separated by one bridge. When KOH is added, perhaps each Br undergoes elimination, but how?

Wait, each bridgehead is connected to two CH2 groups. So, if each Br is on a bridgehead, then eliminating HBr from each would form a carbonyl group. So, the bridgehead becomes a ketone.

So, product 1 would be 1,3-adamantanedione, with two ketone groups on the bridgeheads.

Now, looking at the NMR data for product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H).

The 4.79 ppm is a sharp peak for 2H. Maybe those are the protons adjacent to the carbonyl groups. Wait, but in 1,3-adamantanedione, the carbons next to the ketones (the CH2 groups) would have protons in the 2.2-2.4 ppm range. So why is there a peak at 4.79?

Hmm, that doesn't fit. Maybe the 4.79 is from another group, perhaps an epoxide? Or maybe it's an exchangeable proton, but the question says to exclude those.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the product isn't a diketone but a cyclic ketone. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the initial reaction forms a gem-diol, but that doesn't seem right either.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't a di-elimination but a mono-elimination. So, only one Br is eliminated, forming a carbonyl and leaving the other Br as is. But that wouldn't explain the IR peak, which is a strong C=O. Plus, product 1 is a solid, which might not fit if it's a mono-substituted compound.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should move on to product 2 and see if that helps.

Product 1 is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide upon heating. Aluminum isopropoxide (Al(i-Pr)3) is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation reactions. But product 1 is a carbonyl-containing compound, possibly a diketone. So, perhaps product 1 undergoes some kind of Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but I don't see an aromatic ring here. Alternatively, maybe it's undergoing a ketone alkylation, but that's not common.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and aluminum isopropoxide is used in ring-opening reactions. Epoxides can react with acids to form carbocation intermediates. So, if product 1 is an epoxide, then heating with Al(i-Pr)3 would protonate the epoxide, leading to ring-opening.

Wait, but product 1's IR doesn't match an epoxide. Unless the initial product was an epoxide, but then the IR would have a peak around 1250 cm^-1 for the C-O stretch. But the IR is 1720, which is more like a ketone.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 isn't a ketone but an ester or something else. But I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a ketone, and when treated with Al(i-Pr)3, it undergoes some kind of acylation. But I'm not clear on what that would be.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and product 2 is formed via ring-opening. Let's imagine product 1 is an epoxide. Then, product 2 would be the ring-opened product, maybe a diol or some other structure.

But without knowing what product 1 is, it's hard to proceed. Let me try to think of another approach.

The reaction steps: product 1 → product 2 with Al(i-Pr)3, then product 2 is ozonolyzed to product 3.

Ozonolysis of a diene typically breaks the double bond and forms carbonyl groups. The coupling pattern in product 3's NMR would depend on the structure of product 2, specifically the diene.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a diene because ozonolysis is done on it. So, product 3 comes from ozonolysis of product 2, which is a diene.

So, working backwards:

Product 3 is formed after ozonolysis and workup. The most deshielded proton in product 3's NMR is in question.

In ozonolysis, a diene is cleaved into carbonyl compounds. For example, a 1,3-diene would break into two carbonyls. But if the diene is in a ring or has substituents, the resulting carbonyl groups would have adjacent protons.

Wait, let's think about the coupling. The most deshielded proton would be near an electronegative group, like a carbonyl. In such cases, the protons adjacent to carbonyls are deshielded. The coupling pattern depends on the neighboring protons.

If the diene in product 2 is symmetric or has equivalent protons, the splitting could be more complex.

Alternatively, let's think about the diene in product 2. Suppose it's a conjugated diene, perhaps a 1,3-diene. Upon ozonolysis, it would break into two carbonyl groups. Each end would have a carbonyl, and if there were substituents, their protons would be adjacent to the carbonyl.

Wait, but the most deshielded proton would be on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl. The coupling would depend on the number of neighboring protons.

For example, if a proton is next to a CH2 group (two protons), it would split into a triplet. Or if adjacent to a CH group (one proton), a doublet.

Wait, perhaps the diene in product 2 is such that when ozonolyzed, each carbonyl is adjacent to a CH2 group. Then, those CH2 protons would be split by their neighboring protons.

Wait, maybe product 2 is a substituted cyclopropane? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a bridged bicyclic diene.

But without knowing product 2, it's hard to tell. Let me try to go back.

Product 1 is a light yellow solid, perhaps a ketone. Then product 2 is formed by a Friedel-Crafts-like reaction. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and product 2 is the ring-opened diol. But then ozonolysis wouldn't make sense for a diol.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and product 2 is a diol. Then, product 2 is treated with ozone. Wait, ozone reacts with double bonds, not with diols. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, product 2 might have a double bond, so when ozone is bubbled, it breaks the double bond.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, product 2 is a diol, but then product 2 doesn't have a double bond. That doesn't fit.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think of each step and possible products.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH (excess) → product 1.

Assuming elimination, perhaps we form an epoxide. Let's say product 1 is adamantane epoxide.

Then, step 2: product 1 + Al(i-Pr)3 (excess) → product 2.

Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid. Epoxides can react with Lewis acids to form carbocation intermediates, leading to ring-opening. So, product 2 could be an alcohol or a diol.

Wait, but with Al(i-Pr)3, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But product 1 is an epoxide, which isn't an aromatic compound. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a dienol ether or something else. I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether formed via some kind of elimination.

Wait, another thought: Maybe product 1 is a diketone, and product 2 is formed via a Dieckmann cyclization. Wait, Dieckmann cyclization is for esters, though, not ketones. So that's probably not it.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is formed via a [2+2] cycloaddition or some other reaction, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol. Wait, but the IR of product 1 has a C=O peak, so that's not it.

Hmm, perhaps I should proceed without fully solving the first steps.

Assuming product 2 is a diene, then ozonolysis would cleave the diene into two carbonyl compounds. The structure of product 2 would determine the structure of product 3.

Ozonolysis of a diene typically gives carbonyls. For example, if product 2 is a 1,3-diene, ozonolysis would give two ketones. But if the diene is part of a ring, like cyclopropane, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls.

Wait, but if product 2 is a conjugated diene, like 1,3-butadiene, ozonolysis would give two aldehydes. But in our case, product 3's NMR would have protons adjacent to carbonyls.

The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded proton in product 3. The deshielded protons would be near a carbonyl group because that's where the electron density is lower, making the protons more deshielded and appear downfield.

The possible options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

So, the proton in question is split by neighboring protons. Let's imagine that the proton is adjacent to another set of protons. For example, if it's next to a CH2 group, which has two protons, the coupling would lead to a triplet. But if the CH2 is itself next to another CH2, perhaps more splitting occurs.

Alternatively, if the proton is next to a CH group, which is next to another CH group, the splitting could be more complex.

Wait, let me think of a specific example. Suppose product 3 has a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. Then, the protons on the CH2 groups would be adjacent to two protons on the neighboring CH2, leading to a triplet. But wait, each CH2 group would have protons that are split by the adjacent CH2's two protons. So, each proton would see two neighboring protons, leading to a triplet.

But in that case, all the CH2 protons would be triplets.

But the question asks about the most deshielded proton. Maybe it's a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl. For example, O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, but wait, that's a four-carbon chain. Alternatively, suppose product 3 has a structure where a proton is adjacent to two different groups, each with their own protons.

Wait, another scenario: product 2 is a bicyclic diene, and upon ozonolysis, it forms two carbonyl groups connected by some structure. For example, if product 2 is bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyls, giving two ketones. But then, the resulting structure would have protons adjacent to the carbonyls.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 has a structure where each carbonyl is connected to a CH2 group, which is adjacent to another CH group. For example, O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-C=O. So, the CH2 group would have two protons, each coupling with the neighboring CH's protons.

Wait, maybe the most deshielded proton is on a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl. Let's say it's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. So, each CH2 proton would be split by the adjacent CH2's two protons, leading to a triplet.

But if the CH2 is next to another CH2, which is in turn next to another CH2, the splitting could be more complex.

Wait, another approach: the most deshielded proton would be on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group. Let's say it's a CH2 next to a carbonyl. Each H on CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs on the next CH2 group. So each H would be split into a triplet. Alternatively, if the CH2 is next to a CH group, which has another CH, the splitting could be more.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the proton is adjacent to two different types of neighboring protons. For example, one adjacent CH2 and another adjacent CH. That could lead to more splitting.

Alternatively, if the proton is next to a CH2 group (two H) and another CH group (one H), the splitting would be a triplet of triplets. Because each proton would couple with two from one group and one from another, leading to 2+1 = 3, so 3x3=9 peaks, which simplifies to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but in the options, triplet of triplets is option B, and doublet of triplets is C. So, which is more likely?

Alternatively, maybe the proton is adjacent to two different sets of protons. For example, one set with two protons and another set with one proton. So, each proton would be split by two (from one neighbor) and one (from another), leading to (n+1)(m+1) = (2+1)(1+1) = 3*2=6, which would be a triplet of doublets or a doublet of triplets, depending on the order.

Wait, but the options include triplet of triplets and doublet of triplets. Let me think of the scenario where a proton is adjacent to two sets of two protons each. For example, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, then each CH2 proton would be adjacent to two others on the same CH2 and two on the neighboring CH2. Wait no, each CH2 proton is adjacent to two others on the same CH2, but the neighboring CH2's protons are two away, so they might not split in the same way. Wait, in vicinal coupling, the coupling is between adjacent protons, so perhaps each CH2 group's protons are split by the neighboring CH2's protons.

Wait, in ethyl groups, the CH2CH3 protons show as a quartet because each H on the first CH2 is split by the two H on the adjacent CH2. Similarly, in a longer chain, the splitting can be more complex.

But in our case, perhaps the most deshielded proton is on a CH2 next to a carbonyl, which is adjacent to another CH2. So, each H on the first CH2 would be split by the two H on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is next to a CH group, which is next to another CH2, the splitting could be more complex. For example, each H on the first CH2 is split by two from the adjacent CH2 (triplet) and perhaps another split from the CH group.

Wait, but if the H is on a CH group, adjacent to a CH2 group and a carbonyl, then each H would couple with the two H on the adjacent CH2 and perhaps another H on the same carbon if it's a CH2.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the most deshielded H is on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl and next to a CH group. So, each H on the CH2 would split into a triplet due to the two H on the adjacent CH group, and perhaps doublet due to another coupling.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think of a simple case where a CH2 group is next to a carbonyl. The H on CH2 would be split by the adjacent CH2's two H, giving a triplet. So, the coupling pattern would be a triplet, which is option A.

But the options also include more complex patterns like triplet of triplets, etc. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded H is on a CH group, adjacent to a CH2 and another CH group. So, each H would split into a triplet due to the two H on the adjacent CH2, and also split by another H on the next CH group, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not sure. Another approach: think about the number of neighboring Hs.

If a proton has two neighboring Hs on one side and two on the other, the splitting could be a quartet. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded H is on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl and next to a CH2 group that is itself adjacent to another CH2. So, each H on the first CH2 would be split by the two H on the next CH2, leading to a triplet.

But if the next CH2 is also adjacent to another CH2, the splitting could be more. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each H is coupled with two H on one side and another two H on the other side, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible answers.

The options are:

A) triplet

B) triplet of triplets

C) doublet of triplets

D) pentet

If the proton is next to two sets of two H each, the splitting would be (2+1)*(2+1) = 9, which is a triplet of triplets. So that would be option B.

Alternatively, if the proton is next to a CH2 (two H) and a CH (one H), the splitting would be (2+1)*(1+1) = 6, which could be a triplet of doublets or a doublet of triplets, depending on the order. So, that would be option C.

But how to decide which scenario is more likely.

If product 3 has a structure where the most deshielded H is on a CH2 group, and that CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 group, then each H would be split into a triplet. So, option A.

Alternatively, if the structure is such that the H is on a CH group adjacent to two CH2 groups, each with two H, then the splitting would be more complex.

Wait, perhaps the ozonolysis product has a structure where each carbonyl is connected to a CH2 group, which is adjacent to another CH2 group. For example, O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. Each CH2's H would be split by the two H on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

But in that case, all the CH2 H would be triplets. The most deshielded would be the H next to the carbonyl, which would be a triplet.

Alternatively, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-C=O, then the H on CH2 would be split by two H on the adjacent CH, leading to a triplet. The H on CH would be split by the two H on CH2 (triplet) and perhaps others.

But the most deshielded H would be on the CH2 next to the carbonyl, which would be a triplet.

So, perhaps the correct answer is A) triplet.

But wait, another possibility: the ozonolysis could break a conjugated diene into two ketones, each with a CH2 group adjacent. So, the product would have two CH2 groups next to the ketones.

In that case, each CH2's H would be split by the adjacent CH2's two H, making a triplet. So, the most deshielded H would be a triplet.

So, the answer would be A) triplet.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the splitting is more complex.

Wait, if the diene in product 2 is part of a ring, like a cyclopropane, then ozonolysis might break it into two carbonyl groups connected by a bridge. The resulting structure could have a CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl and perhaps another CH group.

In that case, the H on the CH2 would be split by the adjacent CH group's H (doublet) and possibly another set.

Hmm, this is getting too speculative. I think the most straightforward answer is that the coupling is a triplet, so option A.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Step 1: Reaction with KOH**  
   Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH likely involves elimination of two HBr molecules due to the strong base. This forms a carbonyl-containing compound, consistent with the IR absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹, which indicates a C=O stretch. The most plausible product is 1,3-adamantanedione, a diketone.

2. **Step 2: Reaction with Al(i-Pr)₃**  
   Aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid, is used here. While the exact reaction mechanism is unclear, it likely facilitates further transformation of the diketone. However, the exact structure of product 2 is not explicitly determined.

3. **Step 3: Ozonolysis of Product 2**  
   Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl compounds. If product 2 contains a conjugated diene, ozonolysis would break the double bond, forming two carbonyl groups. The resulting product 3 would have protons adjacent to carbonyl groups, which are deshielded and appear downfield in the NMR spectrum.

4. **Analysis of the Most Deshielded Proton in Product 3**  
   The most deshielded proton in product 3 is likely on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group. The coupling pattern depends on the number of neighboring protons:
   - If the proton is adjacent to a CH₂ group (two protons), it would split into a triplet.
   - If the proton is adjacent to multiple sets of protons, more complex splitting patterns (e.g., triplet of triplets or doublet of triplets) could arise.

5. **Evaluation of Options**  
   - **A) Triplet**: This occurs if the proton is adjacent to a CH₂ group with two protons.  
   - **B) Triplet of triplets**: This would require the proton to couple with two sets of two protons each.  
   - **C) Doublet of triplets**: This would occur if the proton couples with one proton from one group and two protons from another.  
   - **D) Pentet**: This would require coupling with four equivalent protons, which is less likely in this scenario.

Given the structure of product 3 and the most probable coupling environment, the most deshielded proton is expected to exhibit a **triplet** pattern due to coupling with two protons on an adjacent CH₂ group.
