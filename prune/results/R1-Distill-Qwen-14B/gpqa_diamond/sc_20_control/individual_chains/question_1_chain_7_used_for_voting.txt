Okay, so I've got this question about quantum states and their energy differences. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle here. Oh right, the energy-time uncertainty principle. The formula is delta E * delta t ≈ ħ/2. But wait, isn't it more precise to say delta E is approximately ħ divided by delta t? Or maybe I should think about it as the product being on the order of ħ.

Wait, the energy-time uncertainty principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is approximately equal to ħ (h-bar). So ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt.

The lifetimes given are the times for each state. But wait, in the uncertainty principle, Δt is the time over which the energy is measured. For a state with a short lifetime, the energy is less precisely known because the time is short, so the uncertainty in energy would be larger. So for E1 with a lifetime of 1e-9 seconds, the uncertainty in energy ΔE1 would be around ħ/(1e-9). Similarly, for E2 with 1e-8 seconds, ΔE2 would be ħ/(1e-8).

But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. So for them to be distinguishable, their energy difference must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties, or perhaps larger than each individually? Hmm, maybe each energy has its own uncertainty, so the energy difference needs to be larger than the sum of the two uncertainties so that the peaks don't overlap.

Alternatively, perhaps the condition is that the energy difference should be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, they might not be distinguishable.

Wait, I think the formula for the energy-time uncertainty is ΔE * τ ≈ ħ, where τ is the lifetime (time uncertainty). So for each state, the uncertainty in energy would be ħ divided by the lifetime.

So let me calculate the uncertainty for each. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. So h-bar, ħ, is h/(2π) ≈ 1.055e-34 J·s.

So for E1, τ1 = 1e-9 s. So ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = (1.055e-34) / (1e-9) = 1.055e-25 J. Wait, but that's in Joules. I need to convert to eV because the options are in eV.

I know that 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So to convert Joules to eV, we divide by 1.602e-19.

So ΔE1 in eV is (1.055e-25 J) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ (1.055 / 1.602) * 1e-6 eV ≈ ~0.66e-6 eV ≈ 6.6e-7 eV.

Similarly for E2, τ2 =1e-8 s. So ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 = 1.055e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.055e-26 J. Convert to eV: 1.055e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ (1.055/1.602) * 1e-7 eV ≈ ~0.66e-7 eV = 6.6e-8 eV.

Wait, but wait a second. Are we considering their energy difference as the sum of both uncertainties or each individually? Because the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty for each to resolve them. Or perhaps the energy difference should be greater than the uncertainty in energy for the transitions. Hmm, I might be mixing up the concepts.

Wait, maybe the energy difference ΔE must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state. So, for each state, the energy is only known within ±ΔE_i. So for E1, the energy is E1 ± ΔE1, and E2 is E2 ± ΔE2. To distinguish, the energy levels must be separated by more than ΔE1 + ΔE2. Because if the energy difference is less than that sum, the intervals would overlap.

So let me compute ΔE1 and ΔE2.

Wait, earlier I got ΔE1 ≈ 6.6e-7 eV, ΔE2 ≈ 6.6e-8 eV. So their sum is approximately 6.6e-7 + 0.66e-7 = 7.26e-7 eV. So the energy difference between E1 and E2 should be greater than this sum to be distinguishable.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. So perhaps the actual energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty in energy of each state. Let me think.

No, I think the correct approach is to ensure that the energy difference is larger than the uncertainty in energy of the measurement. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, you can't distinguish between the two states. So perhaps the condition is that the energy difference ΔE should be greater than the maximum of ΔE1 and ΔE2.

Wait, but each state has its own uncertainty. So for the two states to be resolved, the separation in energy should be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties. Because if the separation is smaller than the sum, the energy levels would overlap in their uncertainties and you can't distinguish them.

So let's compute the sum of the two uncertainties.

ΔE1 is about 6.6e-7 eV, ΔE2 is 6.6e-8 eV. So sum is approximately 6.6e-7 + 0.66e-7 = 7.26e-7 eV.

So the energy difference should be greater than this. Let's look at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 1e-9 (too small)
B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller (no)
C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV, which is much larger than 7.26e-7 eV.
D) 1e-8 eV → 0.00000001 eV, which is 1e-8. Wait, 7.26e-7 is 0.726e-6, which is larger than 1e-8. So D's 1e-8 is smaller than the required 7.26e-7.

Wait, wait, that's a problem. Because option C is 1e-4, which is 1e-4 eV, which is way larger than 7.26e-7 eV. So that would satisfy the condition.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me redo the calculations more carefully.

First, compute ħ in eV·s. Since ħ = h/(2π) ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

Convert to eV·s: since 1 eV = 1.602176634e-19 J,

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s / (1.602176634e-19 J/eV) = (1.0545718 / 1.602176634) e-15 eV·s ≈ 0.65823e-15 eV·s ≈ 6.5823e-16 eV·s.

So ΔE ≈ ħ / τ.

For τ1 = 1e-9 s,

ΔE1 = (6.5823e-16 eV·s) / (1e-9 s) ) = 6.5823e-7 eV.

Similarly, for τ2 = 1e-8 s,

ΔE2 = (6.5823e-16) / (1e-8) ) = 6.5823e-8 eV.

So the sum of ΔE1 and ΔE2 is 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 ≈ 7.238e-7 eV.

So the energy difference between E2 and E1 should be greater than 7.238e-7 eV for them to be distinguishable.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.000000001 eV → way too small.
B) 1e-11 → even smaller.
C) 1e-4 → 0.0001 eV → much bigger than 7e-7.
D) 1e-8 → 0.00000001 eV → less than 7e-7.

So the only option that meets the condition is option C, 1e-4 eV. Because that's way larger than 7.24e-7 eV.

Wait a second, but wait. The question is about the energy difference between the two states. So E2 - E1 must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties.

So, if E2-E1 > (ΔE1 + ΔE2), then they are distinguishable.

So the energy difference must be larger than approximately 7.2e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, only option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV, which is about 1.38e3 times larger than 7.2e-7 eV.

So the correct answer should be option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energy difference required to distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the energy-time uncertainty principle:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \approx \hbar,
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the uncertainty in energy, \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state, and \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant (\( \hbar \approx 6.5823 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \)).

### Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainty for each state
For \( E_1 \) with lifetime \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{6.5823 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s}}{10^{-9} \, \text{s}} = 6.5823 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

For \( E_2 \) with lifetime \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{6.5823 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s}}{10^{-8} \, \text{s}} = 6.5823 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Determine the total energy uncertainty
To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties in energy:
\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2.
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\Delta E > 6.5823 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} + 6.5823 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} = 7.2405 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 3: Analyze the options
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is much smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so the energy levels cannot be distinguished.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \), so the energy levels cannot be distinguished.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is much larger than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so the energy levels can be distinguished.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so the energy levels cannot be distinguished.

### Conclusion
The only energy difference that satisfies the condition for distinguishing the two energy levels is \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \).

Okay, so I've got this question about quantum states and their energy differences. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved. The options are A to D.

Wait, the energy-time uncertainty principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is approximately equal to ħ (h-bar). So ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt.

The lifetimes given are the times for each state. But wait, in the uncertainty principle, Δt is the time over which the energy is measured. For a state with a short lifetime, the energy is less precisely known because the time is short, so the uncertainty in energy would be larger. So for E1 with a lifetime of 1e-9 seconds, the uncertainty in energy ΔE1 would be around ħ/(1e-9). Similarly, for E2 with 1e-8 seconds, ΔE2 would be ħ/(1e-8).

Wait, I think the formula for the energy-time uncertainty is ΔE * τ ≈ ħ, where τ is the lifetime (time uncertainty). So for each state, the uncertainty in energy would be ħ divided by the lifetime.

So let me calculate the uncertainty for each. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. So h-bar, ħ, is h/(2π) ≈ 1.055e-34 J·s.

So for E1, τ1 = 1e-9 s. So ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = (1.055e-34) / (1e-9) = 1.055e-25 J. Wait, but that's in Joules. I need to convert to eV because the options are in eV.

I know that 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So to convert Joules to eV, we divide by 1.602e-19.

So ΔE1 in eV is (1.055e-25 J) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ (1.055 / 1.602) * 1e-6 eV ≈ ~0.66e-6 eV ≈ 6.6e-7 eV.

Similarly for E2, τ2 =1e-8 s. So ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 = 1.055e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.055e-26 J. Convert to eV: 1.055e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ (1.055/1.602) * 1e-7 eV ≈ ~0.66e-7 eV = 6.6e-8 eV.

Wait, but wait a second. Are we considering their energy difference as the sum of both uncertainties or each individually? Because the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty for each to resolve them. Or perhaps the energy difference should be greater than the uncertainty in energy for the transitions. Hmm, I might be mixing up the concepts.

Wait, maybe the energy difference ΔE must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state. So, for each state, the energy is only known within ±ΔE_i. So for E1, the energy is E1 ± ΔE1, and E2 is E2 ± ΔE2. To distinguish, the energy levels must be separated by more than ΔE1 + ΔE2. Because if the energy difference is less than that sum, the intervals would overlap.

So let me compute ΔE1 and ΔE2.

Wait, earlier I got ΔE1 ≈ 6.6e-7 eV, ΔE2 ≈ 6.6e-8 eV. So their sum is approximately 6.6e-7 + 0.66e-7 = 7.26e-7 eV. So the energy difference between E1 and E2 should be greater than this sum to be distinguishable.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. So perhaps the actual energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty in energy of each state. Let me think.

No, I think the correct approach is to ensure that the energy difference is larger than the uncertainty in energy of the measurement.

Because if the separation is smaller than the sum, the energy levels would overlap in their uncertainties and you can't distinguish them.

So let's compute the sum of the two uncertainties.

ΔE1 is about 6.6e-7 eV, ΔE2 is 6.6e-8 eV. So sum is approximately 6.6e-7 + 0.66e-7 = 7.26e-7 eV.

So the energy difference should be greater than this. Let's look at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 1e-9 (too small)
B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller (no)
C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV, which is much larger than 7.26e-7 eV.
D) 1e-8 eV → 0.00000001 eV, which is 1e-8. Wait, 7.26e-7 is 0.726e-6, which is larger than 1e-8. So D's 1e-8 is smaller than the required 7.26e-7.

Wait, wait, that's a problem. Because option C is 1e-4, which is 1e-4 eV, which is way larger than 7.26e-7 eV. So that would satisfy the condition.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me redo the calculations more carefully.

First, compute ħ in eV·s. Since ħ = h/(2π) ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

Convert to eV·s: since 1 eV = 1.602176634e-19 J,

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s / (1.602176634e-19 J/eV) = (1.0545718 / 1.602176634) e-15 eV·s ≈ 0.65823e-15 eV·s ≈ 6.5823e-16 eV·s.

So ΔE ≈ ħ / τ.

For τ1 = 1e-9 s,

ΔE1 = (6.5823e-16 eV·s) / (1e-9 s) ) = 6.5823e-7 eV.

Similarly, for τ2 = 1e-8 s,

ΔE2 = (6.5823e-16) / (1e-8) ) = 6.5823e-8 eV.

So the sum of ΔE1 and ΔE2 is 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 ≈ 7.238e-7 eV.

So the energy difference between E2 and E1 should be greater than 7.238e-7 eV for them to be distinguishable.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.000000001 eV → way too small.
B) 1e-11 → even smaller.
C) 1e-4 → 0.0001 eV → much bigger than 7e-7.
D) 1e-8 → 0.00000001 eV → less than 7e-7.

So the only option that meets the condition is option C, 1e-4 eV. Because that's way larger than 7.24e-7 eV.

Wait a second, but wait. The question is about the energy difference between the two states. So E2 - E1 must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties.

So, if E2-E1 > (ΔE1 + ΔE2), then they are distinguishable.

So the energy difference must be larger than approximately 7.2e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, only option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV, which is about 1.38e3 times larger than 7.2e-7 eV.

So the correct answer should be option C.


To determine the energy difference required to distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the energy-time uncertainty principle:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \approx \hbar,
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the uncertainty in energy, \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state, and \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant (\( \hbar \approx 6.5823 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \)).

### Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainty for each state
For \( E_1 \) with lifetime \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{6.5823 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s}}{10^{-9} \, \text{s}} = 6.5823 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

For \( E_2 \) with lifetime \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{6.5823 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s}}{10^{-8} \, \text{s}} = 6.5823 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Determine the total energy uncertainty
To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties in energy:
\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2.
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\Delta E > 6.5823 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} + 6.5823 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} = 7.2405 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 3: Analyze the options
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is much smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so the energy levels cannot be distinguished.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \), so the energy levels cannot be distinguished.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is much larger than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so the energy levels can be distinguished.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so the energy levels cannot be distinguished.

### Conclusion
The only energy difference that satisfies the condition for distinguishing the two energy levels is \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \).
