Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson X. Let me try to figure it out step by step.

First, I need to read the question carefully. The problem is about the interaction between a bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my Lagrangians, but I think this is a Yukawa-type interaction because it involves a scalar (boson) coupling to fermions.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So, I'm supposed to find which fermion pairs X can decay into.

Wait, kinematic allowance here means that the energy must be sufficient for the production of the fermion pair. So, the mass of X must be at least twice the mass of the fermion for each pair. Because when a particle decays, the rest mass of the decay products must be less than the mass of the decaying particle.

But wait, X is a boson. So, it can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs, right? Because bosons are usually force carriers and can annihilate into matter-antimatter pairs.

So the possible decay products are pairs of fermions. Now, which fermions are available? Let's list the possible fermions that could be produced.

The fermions are quarks and leptons. Let me think:

Quarks: up (u), down (d), strange (s), charm (c), bottom (b), top (t). But wait, top quarks are really heavy, around 173 GeV, way more than 6 GeV. So t and anything heavier are out.

Similarly, for leptons: electron (e), muon (μ), tau (τ). The tau is about 1.78 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV, so possible. Electrons and muons are much lighter, so their antiparticles can be produced.

So possible fermion pairs would be any two fermions where each has a mass less than 3 GeV (since 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV). Let's see each fermion's approximate mass:

- Up quark: about 2 MeV, negligible.
- Down quark: ~4-5 MeV, also negligible.
- Strange quark: around 100 MeV, maybe up to 150 MeV. So definitely under 3 GeV.
- Charm quark: around 1.5 GeV. So 6 GeV is more than 3 GeV, so 2 * 1.5 =3, so yes, can decay into c c-bar.
- Bottom quark: ~4.5 GeV. Wait, 4.5 *2 is 9 GeV. But X is 6 GeV. So 6 < 9? No, so X can't decay into b b-bar. So that's out.

Wait, wait. Wait, for decay into b b-bar: each b quark is about 4.5 GeV. So X with 6 GeV has to have enough energy. 4.5 *2 is 9 GeV, which is more than 6, so impossible. So b quark pairs are out.

Wait, but sometimes the actual masses can vary, but I think the dominant quarks with masses under 3 GeV are u, d, s, c. So the possible pairs would be u u-bar, d d-bar, s s-bar, c c-bar, e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-.

Wait, tau is about 1.78 GeV each. So 2 * 1.78 ≈ 3.56 GeV. X is 6 GeV, which is more than that, so allowed.

What about the other leptons? Electrons are about 0.5 MeV, so their pair is negligible. Muons are about 0.1 GeV, so 2 * 0.1 is 0.2 GeV, which is way under 6. So all lepton pairs are allowed.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check.

Option A includes b and s, u, d, tau, e. So if b is not allowed, then A is out. Because X can't decay into b b-bar.

Option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that's c c-bar. Because the mass of c is about 1.5 GeV, so 2*1.5=3 <6, so allowed.

So possible decays would include c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Now looking at the options. Let me see each option.

Option A includes b, which isn't allowed. So A is incorrect.

Option B includes all the allowed ones except t, which isn't in any option. So B says X can decay into c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau, mu, e. That seems correct.

Option C includes c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e. But t is too heavy; X can't decay into t t-bar. So C is incorrect.

Option D includes b, which isn't allowed. So D is wrong.

So the correct option should be B.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the fermion masses.

Charm quark: about 1.27 GeV (current algebra gives around 1.5 GeV, but precise value varies). So 2 * 1.5 is 3 GeV. 3 <6, so allowed.

Bottom quark: about 4.1-4.7 GeV. So 2 *4.7=9.4 GeV. 9.4>6, so X can't decay into b b-bar.

So which fermions can X decay into? Let's list:

- u and d: yes, their masses are negligible, so 2*m_u ~ 0, allowed.

- s: s quark mass is about 100 MeV, so 2*0.1=0.2 GeV <6.

- c: as above, 2*1.5=3 <6.

- tau: 2*1.78≈3.56 <6.

- e: 2*0.5 MeV << 6.

- mu: 2*0.1 GeV=0.2 <<6.

So all the fermion pairs except for those involving b or t are allowed. So the allowed are c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that's exactly what option B says.

So the answer should be option B.

The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian provided indicates that \( X \) can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. For a decay to be kinematically allowed, the mass of \( X \) must be at least twice the mass of the fermion in the pair.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Fermion Masses**:
   - Quarks: The masses of up (\( u \)), down (\( d \)), strange (\( s \)), and charm (\( c \)) quarks are significantly less than 3 GeV, making their pairs kinematically allowed.
   - Bottom (\( b \)) quark: Its mass is approximately 4.5 GeV, and \( 2 \times 4.5 = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( b\bar{b} \) decay is not allowed.
   - Top (\( t \)) quark: Its mass is approximately 173 GeV, far exceeding 6 GeV, so \( t\bar{t} \) decay is not allowed.
   - Leptons: The masses of electrons (\( e \)), muons (\( \mu \)), and taus (\( \tau \)) are 0.5 MeV, 0.1 GeV, and 1.78 GeV, respectively. For all these leptons, \( 2 \times m_{\text{lepton}} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \), so their pairs are allowed.

2. **Allowed Decays**:
   - \( X \rightarrow u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, s\bar{s}, c\bar{c} \): All quark pairs with masses less than 3 GeV are allowed.
   - \( X \rightarrow e^+e^-, \mu^+\mu^-, \tau^+\tau^- \): All lepton pairs are allowed.
   - \( X \rightarrow b\bar{b}, t\bar{t} \): These decays are not allowed due to the high masses of the \( b \) and \( t \) quarks.

3. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.
   - **Option B**: Lists \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
   - **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.
   - **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are \( X \rightarrow c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^- \), as stated in **Option B**.
