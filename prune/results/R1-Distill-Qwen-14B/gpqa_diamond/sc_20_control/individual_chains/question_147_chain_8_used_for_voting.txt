Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation processes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The problem says p + p-bar → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. So a proton and an antiproton annihilate each other and produce two particles of each A⁺ and A⁻. The antiproton is moving slowly, which probably means that its kinetic energy is much smaller than its rest energy, so maybe we can approximate it as if it's at rest? Or wait, the problem says it's "slowly moving," so maybe the velocity is low, but I'm not entirely sure how that plays into the problem.

The given mass energy of A is m_A c² = 300 MeV. The question is asking for the velocity of particle A.

Wait, but what do I know about annihilation processes? When particles annihilate, they convert into other particles. Since a proton and antiproton are annihilating, their rest mass energy will contribute to the creation of the new particles. But I need to think about conservation laws here—probably energy and momentum.

So, let's list what's conserved. In any closed system, energy and momentum are conserved. So, the initial energy and momentum must equal the final.

The initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. Let's think about their rest masses. A proton's rest mass is about 938 MeV/c², I believe. Similarly, the antiproton has the same mass as the proton. So each has about 938 MeV of rest energy.

But wait, the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly. So, perhaps the initial energy is just the sum of the rest energies of the proton and antiproton, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, because the antiproton is moving, it has kinetic energy. But if it's moving slowly, maybe the kinetic energy is negligible compared to the rest energy? Or perhaps not. Hmm, but since it's moving, we can't ignore it entirely.

Wait, the initial setup: the proton is presumably at rest, and the antiproton is moving towards it. Or maybe both are moving? Wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. Hmm. It's a bit ambiguous, but I think the standard assumption is that the target (proton) is at rest, and the antiproton is moving towards it. But the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly, so perhaps its kinetic energy is much less than its rest energy.

Wait, but in any case, let me try to model this.

Let's denote the initial system as a proton and an antiproton. Let's assign variables. Let me set the initial frame as the rest frame of the proton. So proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with velocity v. But since the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps its velocity is much less than c, so maybe non-relativistic? Or maybe it's just that the kinetic energy is not negligible, but it's not stated as such. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the initial kinetic energy is negligible, so the proton and antiproton are at rest. But wait, if they are annihilating, they must be moving towards each other, right? Or maybe the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving towards it, but slowly.

Wait, but the problem states the antiproton is moving slowly. So perhaps it's moving at a low speed, so that its gamma factor is close to 1. So we can maybe approximate using non-relativistic kinematics? Or perhaps we have to handle it relativistically because the product particles might have significant velocities.

But the question is about the velocity of the particles A, which are the products. So the initial momentum comes from the antiproton, possibly, and the proton is at rest.

Let me think about this. The initial momentum is all from the antiproton. The proton is at rest, so its momentum is zero. So the total initial momentum is that of the antiproton. Then, the final state must have the same total momentum.

In the final state, we have four particles: 2 A⁺ and 2 A⁻. So, each pair would have some momentum, but perhaps due to symmetry, the momenta would be arranged in a way that the total momentum is the same as the initial.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is assuming that the products are moving in such a way that their momenta contribute to a net momentum equal to that of the initial antiproton. Alternatively, maybe the problem is symmetric, leading to particles moving in pairs in opposite directions, canceling some momenta. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial momentum is negligible because the antiproton is moving slowly, so its momentum can be approximated as m_p v, but if v is small, then p is small. Wait, but if the antiproton is moving, then the total initial momentum is the momentum of the antiproton.

Wait, but in the rest frame of the proton, the proton has zero momentum, and the antiproton has momentum gamma*m_p*v. But since the antiproton is moving slowly, gamma is approximately 1, so p ≈ m_p v.

Now, considering the final state: four particles. Let's say all four are moving in a symmetric way, perhaps two in one direction and two in the opposite, but their momenta add up. Alternatively, perhaps the two A+ and two A- are moving in such a way that their momenta sum up to the initial momentum. Or maybe each A has some momentum, and the vector sum gives the initial momentum.

But this seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a better approach. Let's think about energy and momentum conservation.

Initial energy is the sum of the proton's rest energy and the antiproton's total energy. The proton is at rest, so its energy is m_p c². The antiproton's energy is gamma m_p c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Since it's moving slowly, gamma is approximately 1, so E_initial ≈ (m_p c²) + (m_p c²) + K, where K is the kinetic energy. Wait, no, because the rest energy is m_p c², and the kinetic energy is (gamma -1)m_p c². If the antiproton is moving slowly, gamma is close to 1, so K is small.

Wait, but the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly, so perhaps the initial kinetic energy is negligible, and the total initial energy is approximately 2 m_p c². Alternatively, maybe the initial energy is just 2 m_p c², and the initial momentum is negligible because the velocity is low, but that can't be right because some momentum must be carried by the antiproton. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial total momentum is the momentum of the antiproton, which is p_initial = gamma m_p v, where v is small, so approximate as m_p v. But perhaps in this problem, the initial momentum is zero because the proton and antiproton are moving towards each other with equal and opposite momenta. Wait, but in that case, their total momentum would cancel, but if the proton is at rest, then only the antiproton has momentum.

Wait a second, perhaps the setup is that the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving towards it. So, the initial momentum is all from the antiproton.

In that case, the initial total energy is the proton's rest energy plus the antiproton's total energy (relativistic). The final total energy must equal this, and the final momentum must equal the initial momentum (which is the antiproton's momentum).

So, let me write down the conservation equations.

Initial energy: E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c²
Initial momentum: p_initial = gamma m_p v

Final energy: E_final = 2*(E_A⁺) + 2*(E_A⁻)
Final momentum: p_final = 2*(p_A⁺) + 2*(p_A⁻)

But since the problem says the products are 2 A⁺ and 2 A⁻, perhaps the momenta of the A⁻ are opposite to the A⁺? Or maybe all four particles move in the same direction. Hmm, that's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the A⁺ and A⁻ have the same magnitude of momentum but opposite directions, so their momenta sum to zero. Then the total momentum would come solely from the initial antiproton.

Wait, but that can't be, because then the initial momentum (p_initial) would have to equal zero, which would require the antiproton's momentum to be zero. But if the antiproton is moving, that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the A⁺ and A⁻ are emitted symmetrically. Let me think. Let's assume that each A⁺ and A⁻ has the same speed, but in opposite directions. So their momenta would cancel each other. Wait, but if there are two A⁺ and two A⁻, perhaps they are moving in pairs.

Wait, perhaps the products are arranged in two pairs. Like, two A⁺ moving in one direction and two A⁻ moving in the opposite direction. But since they are charged particles, perhaps their momentum directions are arranged to balance each other. Maybe the total momentum is 2p_A⁺ - 2p_A⁻. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps all four particles have the same speed, but their momenta add in such a way that the total is equal to the initial momentum of the antiproton.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should approach this using conservation of energy and momentum, using variables.

Let me denote:
- The proton is at rest, so its energy is m_p c², and momentum is zero.
- The antiproton has momentum p_initial = gamma m_p v. Since it's moving slowly, v is small, so gamma ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2 c²), but for small v, gamma is approximately 1. So p_initial ≈ m_p v.

Wait, but if the antiproton is moving with speed v, which is small, then gamma is about 1, so E_initial of the antiproton is approximately m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v².

So, the total initial energy is E_initial = m_p c² (proton's rest energy) + m_p c² (antiproton's rest energy) + (1/2) m_p v² (kinetic energy of the antiproton). Hmm, perhaps not. Wait, the antiproton's total energy is gamma m_p c², and since v is small, gamma ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2 c²). So E_initial = m_p c² + (m_p c²) (1 + (v²)/(2 c²)) ) = 2 m_p c² + (m_p v²)/(2 c²) * c² ? Wait, no, that can't be right.

Wait, no. Let me compute E_initial. The proton is at rest, so its energy is m_p c². The antiproton has kinetic energy K = (gamma - 1) m_p c². Since v is small, gamma ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2 c²), so K ≈ (v²)/(2 c²) m_p c² = (1/2) m_p v².

So E_initial ≈ m_p c² (proton) + m_p c² (antiproton's rest) + (1/2 m_p v²) (antiproton's KE) ) = 2 m_p c² + (1/2 m_p v²).

But for the final state, we have four particles: 2 A⁺ and 2 A⁻. Let me denote the energy of each A as E_A and the momentum as p_A. Since particles are moving in opposite directions perhaps, their momenta could add up.

But perhaps it's easier to think in terms of invariant quantities. The total invariant mass squared is (E_total)^2 - (p_total c)^2 = (sum E_i)^2 - (sum p_i c)^2.

Wait, the initial system's invariant mass squared is (E_initial)^2 - (p_initial c)^2.

E_initial = m_p c² (proton) + gamma m_p c² (antiproton) ≈ 2 m_p c² + (1/2 m_p v²) (since gamma is about 1).

p_initial c = gamma m_p v c ≈ m_p v c.

So (E_initial)^2 ≈ (2 m_p c²)^2 + 2*(2 m_p c²)*(1/2 m_p v²) + (1/2 m_p v²)^2 ≈ 4 m_p^2 c^4 + 2 m_p^2 c^4 (v^2/c^2) ) + ... but since v is small, higher-order terms are negligible.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute the invariant mass squared:

s = (E_initial)^2 - (p_initial c)^2 c^2.

Wait, wait, the invariant mass squared is (sum E_i)^2 - (sum (p_i c))^2.

Sum E_i is m_p c² + gamma m_p c².

Sum (p_i c) is gamma m_p v c.

So s = [m_p c² (1 + gamma)]^2 - [gamma m_p v c]^2.

Hmm, but perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps we can assume that the products are all moving in the same direction, but that would complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the products are moving in such a way that their momenta sum up to the initial momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps the products are moving in a symmetric fashion, so that the total momentum from all of them equals the initial momentum. For instance, two A⁺ moving in one direction and two A⁻ moving in the same direction as the initial antiproton, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the four particles are emitted in pairs, each pair moving in opposite directions, but with the same speed. Wait, perhaps each pair (A⁺ and A⁻) has their momenta canceling each other, so that the total momentum of the products is zero. But that can't be because the initial momentum was not zero.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should simplify the problem by making some approximations. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps we can treat this as a non-relativistic process.

Wait, but the products are likely to be moving at relativistic speeds, given that their rest mass is 300 MeV, which is much less than the proton's rest mass. So the products could have high speeds.

Wait, the proton's rest mass is about 938 MeV/c², and the A particles are 300 MeV/c² each. So each A is lighter than the proton.

So, when the proton and antiproton annihilate, the rest mass energy is 2 * 938 MeV ≈ 1876 MeV. The products have a rest mass of 4 * 300 MeV = 1200 MeV. So the initial rest mass is higher than the products' rest mass, meaning that kinetic energy is available for the products to move.

Let me get back to the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps the initial situation is that the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with some velocity. So, let me denote the initial proton's frame as the lab frame. 

In this frame, the initial momentum is p_initial = gamma m_p v, where v is the velocity of the antiproton.

The initial energy is E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c².

The final energy is E_final = 4 * E_A, since there are four A particles. Each E_A is the total energy of the A, which is gamma_A m_A c².

The final momentum is p_final = 4 * p_A, but this depends on the direction. Wait, but if the products are moving in such a way that their momenta sum up to p_initial, perhaps you can ignore some terms. Alternatively, perhaps all four are moving in the same direction, which would make the total momentum 4 p_A. But that's a big assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the products are emitted symmetrically, so that the momenta of the A⁺ and A⁻ cancel each other. But given that the initial momentum isn't zero, that can't be the case.

Wait, perhaps each A⁺ and A⁻ has the same speed but in opposite directions. So for each pair of A⁺ and A⁻, their momenta would be opposite. So, if there are two A⁺ moving in one direction and two A⁻ moving in the opposite direction, their total momentum would be 2 p_A⁺ - 2 p_A⁻. But for this to equal the initial momentum, which is p_initial = m_p v (assuming gamma ≈ 1), perhaps p_A⁺ and p_A⁻ have certain relations.

But this seems a bit involved. Alternatively, perhaps all four particles have the same speed, but in the same direction. Then the total momentum is 4 p_A, which must equal the initial momentum p_initial.

But let's proceed with this assumption for a moment. So:

p_final = 4 p_A = p_initial = m_p v.

Each A has momentum p_A = gamma_A m_A v_A. But since the mass of A is much smaller than the proton's mass (300 MeV vs 938 MeV), perhaps their velocities are higher, so gamma_A might be larger than 1.

Wait, but how do we relate this to the energies?

The energy of each A is E_A = gamma_A m_A c².

The total final energy is E_final = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

Now, applying conservation of energy and momentum:

E_initial = E_final.

And p_initial = p_final.

So,

E_initial = m_p c² (proton) + gamma m_p c² (antiproton).

p_initial = gamma m_p v.

So,

E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c² = (1 + gamma) m_p c².

E_final = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

So:

(1 + gamma) m_p c² = 4 gamma_A m_A c². → equation 1.

p_initial = 4 gamma_A m_A v_A. → equation 2.

But we have two equations and variables gamma, v, gamma_A, v_A. Hmm, this might get complicated.

Wait, but perhaps we can relate gamma_A and v_A. Since gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v_A²/c²)).

But maybe we can find a relation between gamma_A and v_A.

But perhaps another approach is to consider the ratio of energy and momentum.

From equation 1 and 2:

From equation 1:

(1 + gamma) m_p c² = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

Divide both sides by c²:

(1 + gamma) m_p = 4 gamma_A m_A.

From equation 2:

gamma m_p v = 4 gamma_A m_A v_A.

Let me denote equation 2 as:

gamma m_p v = 4 gamma_A m_A v_A.

Now, let's express gamma_A from equation 1.

gamma_A = ( (1 + gamma) m_p ) / (4 m_A )

Substitute this into equation 2:

gamma m_p v = 4 * [ (1 + gamma) m_p / (4 m_A) ) ] * m_A v_A.

Simplify the equation:

gamma m_p v = [ (1 + gamma) m_p ] * v_A.

Cancel m_p from both sides:

gamma v = (1 + gamma) v_A.

So,

v_A = (gamma v) / (1 + gamma).

Hmm.

Now, perhaps we can eliminate variables by considering the relation between gamma and v.

Wait, gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

But since the antiproton is moving slowly, v is much less than c, so gamma ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2 c²).

But also, if v is small, then gamma is close to 1, so 1 + gamma ≈ 2.

So, v_A = (gamma v) / (1 + gamma) ≈ (v) * (gamma) / 2.

But since gamma is approximately 1, because v is small, this would make v_A ≈ v/2.

But that seems low, because the products are lighter, so they should have higher velocities.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me proceed more carefully.

Wait, let's think about the initial velocity. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, v << c, so gamma ≈ 1. So, equation 1 becomes:

(1 + 1) m_p c² ≈ 4 gamma_A m_A c².

So 2 m_p c² = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

Dividing both sides by c²:

2 m_p = 4 gamma_A m_A.

So gamma_A = (2 m_p) / (4 m_A) ) = m_p/(2 m_A).

Plugging in m_p = 938 MeV/c² and m_A = 300 MeV/c²,

gamma_A = 938 / (2 * 300) ≈ 938 / 600 ≈ 1.563.

So gamma_A ≈ 1.563.

Now, gamma_A is 1.563.

We can compute v_A from gamma_A.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2).

So,

1.563 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v_A/c)^2 )

=> sqrt(1 - (v_A/c)^2 ) = 1 / 1.563 ≈ 0.64.

Squaring both sides,

1 - (v_A²/c²) = (0.64)^2 ≈ 0.4096.

So,

v_A²/c² = 1 - 0.4096 = 0.5904.

Thus, v_A = c * sqrt(0.5904) ≈ c * 0.768.

Hmm, 0.768 c is approximately 0.77c, which is option A.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any approximations here. I approximated gamma as 1 for the antiproton, which might not be entirely accurate because even a small v can make gamma larger than 1. But given that the antiproton is moving slowly, this approximation is acceptable. 

Wait, but in reality, when we derived v_A, it was under the assumption that gamma is approximately 1. So perhaps the initial approach is correct. 

Wait, but let me check the calculation of gamma_A again.

From equation 1, after approximation:

gamma_A = m_p / (2 m_A) = 938 / (2 * 300) = 938 / 600 ≈ 1.5633.

Then, using this gamma_A, we compute v_A as sqrt(1 - (1/gamma_A)^2) * c.

Wait, no, let me correct that: the relation is:

gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2), where beta = v_A/c.

So,

beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma_A^2)).

So,

beta = sqrt(1 - (1/(1.5633)^2)).

Compute 1.5633 squared: 1.5633^2 ≈ 2.443.

So,

1/(2.443) ≈ 0.4096.

Thus,

beta = sqrt(1 - 0.4096) = sqrt(0.5904) ≈ 0.768.

So, v_A ≈ 0.768 c, which is approximately 0.77c, so option A.

But wait, the initial assumption was that the antiproton's gamma is approximately 1, which might not be the case. What if the initial momentum isn't that small?

Wait, perhaps I should approach this without approximations. Let me try to find a more accurate solution.

The initial momentum is p_initial = gamma m_p v.

But since the antiproton is moving slowly, v is small. So gamma ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2 c²).

Alternatively, perhaps I can express v in terms of beta, where beta = v/c. So, v = beta c.

So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²).

But if beta is small, then gamma ≈ 1 + beta²/2.

But perhaps this is getting too involved. Let me try to find a more general solution without the approximation.

From equation 1: (1 + gamma) m_p = 4 gamma_A m_A.

From equation 2: gamma m_p beta = 4 gamma_A m_A v_A.

But v_A = beta_A c, where beta_A = v_A/c.

But since we're working in units where c=1, v_A = beta_A.

Wait, perhaps it's better to express things in terms of beta.

Let me define:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2).

gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta_A^2).

Now, from equation 1:

(1 + gamma) m_p = 4 gamma_A m_A.

From equation 2:

gamma m_p beta = 4 gamma_A m_A beta_A.

So, two equations with variables gamma, beta, gamma_A, beta_A.

Hmm, this seems complicated, but perhaps we can eliminate gamma and gamma_A.

Let me express gamma_A from equation 1:

gamma_A = (1 + gamma) m_p / (4 m_A).

Substitute into equation 2:

gamma m_p beta = 4 * [ (1 + gamma) m_p / (4 m_A) ] * beta_A.

Simplify:

gamma beta = [ (1 + gamma) m_p / m_A ] * beta_A.

But m_p is 938 MeV/c², m_A is 300 MeV/c².

So,

gamma beta = (1 + gamma) * (938/300) * beta_A.

So,

gamma beta = (1 + gamma) * 3.1267 * beta_A.

Hmm, this is getting complicated.

But perhaps I can make another substitution. Let me express beta in terms of gamma.

beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2).

So,

gamma * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2) = (1 + gamma) * 3.1267 * beta_A.

But this is still complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps if I can express beta_A in terms of gamma and gamma_A.

But I'm not making progress here. Maybe I should consider that the initial approximation gave a reasonable answer (0.77c), and perhaps that's the correct option.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.77c, which matches our approximation. Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation gives a slightly higher value, like 0.91c, which is option C.

Wait, no, because when I did the approximation, I got 0.768c, which is 0.77c, option A.

But maybe the initial assumption that the antiproton's gamma is 1 is incorrect. Let me re-examine that.

If the antiproton's gamma is not 1, but perhaps higher, would that change the result?

Wait, let's think about the initial approach again. When I assumed gamma ≈1, I got v_A ≈0.77c. But perhaps the exact calculation would give a higher velocity.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial setup is different. Maybe the initial system has both the proton and antiproton at rest, but that can't be because they need to collide. No, I think in this problem, the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving towards it.

Wait, let me consider the initial case where the antiproton is at rest. Then, the initial momentum is zero, and the products must have zero total momentum. But that would require the A's to be emitted symmetrically, perhaps in pairs with opposite momenta. But in that case, their velocities would be non-zero but in opposite directions, leading to a total momentum of zero.

But in that scenario, the initial energy would be 2 m_p c², and the final energy would be 4 m_A c² + kinetic energy. So, energy conservation would require:

2 m_p c² = 4 m_A c² + K_final.

But without the antiproton's motion, the products would have lower kinetic energy, leading to lower velocities.

But in our problem, the antiproton is moving slowly, so perhaps the initial velocity is small, but not zero.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake earlier by assuming all four particles have the same velocity. Perhaps in reality, the products move in opposite directions, so their momenta cancel, but that would require the total momentum to be zero, which contradicts the initial momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps the products have a collective momentum that equals the initial momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps one A⁺ and one A⁻ are emitted in one direction, and the other two in the opposite direction. But this is getting too speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to approach this using the concept of center-of-momentum frame, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the initial system's energy can be found, and from that, calculate the total energy available for the products, which would allow us to find their velocities.

The initial energy in the lab frame is E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c².

The initial momentum is p_initial = gamma m_p v.

In the center-of-momentum frame, the total momentum is zero, so the products would have zero total momentum there. But I'm not sure if that helps here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the total energy and momentum of the products, and from there, find the velocity of each particle.

Wait, perhaps the products are moving in such a way that each A has the same speed, and their directions are arranged so that their momenta sum up to the initial momentum.

But I'm not making progress. Let me try a different approach.

The rest mass of the system (proton + antiproton) is 2 m_p c². The products have rest mass 4 m_A c². So the available energy is 2 m_p c², and the rest mass of the products is 4 m_A c².

Wait, this is getting me confused. Maybe I should compute the energy and momentum of the products and then find their velocity.

Wait, let me try to write down the exact conservation equations without approximation.

E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c².

p_initial = gamma m_p v.

E_final = 4 E_A = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

p_final = 4 p_A = 4 gamma_A m_A v_A.

So,

Equation 1: m_p c² (1 + gamma) = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

Equation 2: gamma m_p v = 4 gamma_A m_A v_A.

Now, divide Equation 2 by Equation 1:

[gamma m_p v] / [m_p (1 + gamma) c² ] = [4 gamma_A m_A v_A ] / [4 gamma_A m_A c² ].

Simplify:

(gamma v) / ( (1 + gamma) c² ) = v_A / c².

Multiply both sides by c²:

gamma v / (1 + gamma) = v_A.

Now, from equation 1, we can express gamma_A in terms of gamma.

gamma_A = [ (1 + gamma) m_p ] / (4 m_A )

Now, substitute this into equation 2. Let me write equation 2 again:

gamma m_p v = 4 gamma_A m_A v_A.

Substitute gamma_A:

gamma m_p v = 4 * [ (1 + gamma) m_p / (4 m_A) ) ] * m_A v_A.

Simplify:

gamma m_p v = (1 + gamma) m_p v_A.

Cancel m_p:

gamma v = (1 + gamma) v_A.

So,

v_A = (gamma v) / (1 + gamma).

Hmm, this is the same as before.

Now, to find v_A, we need to find gamma and v.

But from the initial setup, the antiproton is moving slowly, so v is small. Let's let v = beta c, where beta << 1.

So, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²) ≈ 1 + beta²/2.

So, gamma ≈ 1 + beta²/2.

Now, substituting into v_A:

v_A = [ (1 + beta²/2) beta c ] / ( 2 + beta²/2 )

Wait, this seems a bit messy. Alternatively, since beta is small, we can approximate 1 + gamma ≈ 2.

So,

v_A ≈ (gamma beta c) / 2.

But gamma ≈ 1, so v_A ≈ (beta c)/2.

But I'm not sure how to find beta from this.

Wait, perhaps we can express gamma in terms of beta.

Wait, from the initial energy and momentum, but perhaps that's getting too involved.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the initial momentum p_initial = gamma m_p beta c.

But without knowing the exact value of beta, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed to have the initial antiproton's velocity as v, and we can compute the velocity of the A particles without knowing v. But I'm not seeing how.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is to realize that the products are much lighter, leading to higher velocities.

Wait, another approach: if the initial momentum is p_initial, and the products have four times the momentum (assuming all in same direction), but perhaps that's not the case.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for another way.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using the concept of energy and momentum conservation, but in a non-relativistic way, given that the antiproton is moving slowly.

So, let's assume that the antiproton's kinetic energy is much less than its rest energy, so we can approximate its energy as E_p ≈ m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v².

The proton is at rest, so its energy is m_p c².

So, the initial total energy is E_initial ≈ m_p c² + m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v² = 2 m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v².

The initial momentum is p_initial ≈ m_p v.

The products have four particles, each with mass m_A. Let's assume each has velocity v_A.

But how are their momenta arranged? If all four are moving in the same direction, then the total final momentum is 4 m_A v_A.

Setting this equal to the initial momentum:

4 m_A v_A = m_p v.

So,

v_A = (m_p v)/(4 m_A).

Now, the total energy of the products is 4 [ (1/2) m_A v_A² + m_A c² ].

Setting this equal to E_initial:

4 [ (1/2 m_A v_A^2) + m_A c^2 ] = 2 m_p c^2 + (1/2 m_p v^2).

Simplify the left side:

4 * ( (1/2 m_A v_A^2) + m_A c^2 ) = 2 m_A v_A^2 + 4 m_A c^2.

So,

2 m_A v_A^2 + 4 m_A c^2 = 2 m_p c^2 + (1/2 m_p v^2).

Now, substitute v_A from earlier:

v_A = (m_p v) / (4 m_A).

So,

v_A^2 = (m_p^2 v^2) / (16 m_A^2).

Substituting into the energy equation:

2 m_A * ( m_p^2 v^2 )/(16 m_A^2 ) + 4 m_A c^2 = 2 m_p c^2 + (1/2 m_p v^2).

Simplify the first term:

(2 m_A m_p^2 v^2 )/(16 m_A^2 ) = (2 m_p^2 v^2 )/(16 m_A )) = (m_p^2 v^2 )/(8 m_A ).

So,

(m_p^2 v^2 )/(8 m_A ) + 4 m_A c^2 = 2 m_p c^2 + (1/2 m_p v^2 ).

Now, rearrange terms:

(m_p^2 v^2 )/(8 m_A ) - (1/2 m_p v^2 ) + 4 m_A c^2 - 2 m_p c^2 = 0.

Factor out v^2:

v^2 [ ( m_p^2 )/(8 m_A ) - ( m_p )/2 ] + (4 m_A c^2 - 2 m_p c^2 ) = 0.

Let me compute each term:

First, the coefficient of v^2:

( m_p^2 )/(8 m_A ) - ( m_p ) / 2.

= ( m_p^2 - 4 m_A m_p ) / (8 m_A )

= [ m_p ( m_p - 4 m_A ) ] / (8 m_A ).

The constant term:

4 m_A c^2 - 2 m_p c^2 = 2 c^2 (2 m_A - m_p ).

So, putting it all together:

v^2 [ m_p ( m_p -4 m_A ) / (8 m_A ) ] + 2 c^2 (2 m_A - m_p ) = 0.

Hmm, but this leads to a quadratic equation in v², which may be solvable.

Let me plug in the numbers:

m_p = 938 MeV/c²,

m_A = 300 MeV/c².

Compute the coefficient of v^2:

m_p ( m_p -4 m_A ) / (8 m_A )

= 938 (938 - 4*300 ) / (8 *300 )

= 938 (938 - 1200 ) / 2400

= 938 (-262 ) / 2400

= -938 * 262 / 2400.

Calculate numerator: 938 * 262.

Well, 900 * 262 = 235,800,

38 *262 = 9,956.

Total: 235800 + 9956 = 245,756.

So, 245,756 / 2400 ≈ 102.4.

So, the coefficient is approximately -102.4 (MeV/c²)^2.

The constant term:

2 c^2 (2 m_A - m_p )

= 2 c^2 ( 600 -938 ) MeV/c².

= 2 c^2 (-338) MeV/c².

= -676 c^2 MeV/c².

Wait, but wait, units might not be matching here. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Let me redo this with units considered.

Wait, m_p and m_A are in MeV/c².

So m_p = 938 MeV/c²,

so m_p -4 m_A = 938 - 1200 = -262 MeV/c².

So ( m_p (m_p -4 m_A ) ) = 938 * (-262) (MeV/c²)^2.

Divide by 8 m_A: 8 * 300 = 2400 MeV/c².

So,

(938 * -262) / 2400 ≈ (-245,756) / 2400 ≈ -102.4 (MeV/c²)^2.

The constant term:

4 m_A c^2 - 2 m_p c^2 = (4*300 - 2*938) MeV.

= (1200 - 1876) MeV = (-676) MeV.

So, the equation becomes:

v^2 (-102.4 ) + (-676) = 0.

Wait, that can't be right because v^2 can't be negative.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the signs. Let me double-check the earlier steps.

In the energy equation:

(m_p^2 v^2 )/(8 m_A ) - (1/2 m_p v^2 ) + 4 m_A c^2 - 2 m_p c^2 = 0.

Wait, 4 m_A c^2 - 2 m_p c^2 = (4 m_A - 2 m_p ) c^2.

With m_A =300, m_p=938,

4*300=1200, 2*938=1876.

1200 - 1876 = -676.

So, 4 m_A c^2 - 2 m_p c^2 = -676 c^2.

So, the equation is:

-102.4 v^2 + (-676 c^2 ) = 0.

Which would imply:

-102.4 v^2 = +676 c^2.

Which is impossible because that would require v^2 to be negative. So, this suggests that the assumption of non-relativistic velocities is invalid, which makes sense because the products (A particles) are lighter, so they would have higher velocities, making relativistic effects significant.

Therefore, the non-relativistic approach is not applicable here, and I must use the relativistic approach.

Given that, perhaps I should return to the earlier approximation where I found v_A ≈ 0.77c, which is option A, but that would mean the correct answer is A.

But looking back, perhaps I should consider that in reality, the products have higher velocities, and my initial approximation underestimated their speed. Wait, but earlier calculations gave 0.77c, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps using the concept of invariant mass. The initial four-momentum squared is (E_initial/c)^2 - p_initial^2.

In the initial frame, the proton is at rest, and the antiproton has energy E_p = gamma m_p c² and momentum p_p = gamma m_p v.

So, the initial four-momentum squared is:

s = (E_initial/c)^2 - (p_initial)^2.

E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c².

p_initial = gamma m_p v.

So,

s = [ (m_p c² (1 + gamma) ) / c ]^2 - (gamma m_p v )^2.

Simplify:

s = [ m_p c (1 + gamma) ]^2 - (gamma m_p v )^2.

= m_p^2 c^2 (1 + gamma)^2 - gamma² m_p² v².

Factor out m_p^2:

= m_p^2 [ c^2 (1 + gamma)^2 - gamma² v² ].

Hmm, but v = beta c, so v² = beta² c².

Substituting,

= m_p^2 [ c^2 (1 + gamma)^2 - gamma² beta² c^2 ].

= m_p^2 c² [ (1 + gamma)^2 - gamma² beta² ].

But beta = v/c, and gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta²).

Hmm, perhaps this can be simplified.

Alternatively, since the final state has four particles, perhaps the four-momentum is the sum of each particle's four-momentum.

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the invariant mass s is the same in all frames, so in the center-of-momentum frame, the total momentum is zero, and the total energy is sqrt(s).

In that frame, the energy is sqrt(s), and the products would have their rest energies plus any kinetic energies.

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, perhaps s is the square of the total energy in the COM frame.

But I'm not making progress. Let me try to compute s using the initial values.

s = (E_initial/c)^2 - (p_initial)^2.

But E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c².

p_initial = gamma m_p beta c.

So,

s = [ (m_p c² (1 + gamma) ) / c ]^2 - (gamma m_p beta c )^2.

= [ m_p c (1 + gamma) ]^2 - (gamma m_p beta c )^2.

= m_p^2 c^2 [ (1 + gamma)^2 - gamma^2 beta^2 ].

Now, since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2), beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2).

So, beta^2 = 1 - 1/gamma^2.

Substituting,

s = m_p^2 c^2 [ (1 + gamma)^2 - gamma^2 (1 - 1/gamma^2) ].

Simplify inside the brackets:

(1 + gamma)^2 - gamma^2 (1 - 1/gamma^2 )

= (1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2 ) - (gamma^2 - 1 )

= 1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2 - gamma^2 + 1

= 2 + 2 gamma.

So,

s = m_p^2 c^2 (2 + 2 gamma ) = 2 m_p^2 c^2 (1 + gamma ).

Hmm, so s = 2 m_p^2 c^2 (1 + gamma ).

Now, in the COM frame, the total energy is sqrt(s), and the total momentum is zero.

The energy of the products in the COM frame is 4 m_A c², because their rest mass is 4 m_A c², and if they are at rest in the COM frame, their kinetic energy is zero. But wait, that's not correct because they would have kinetic energy unless they are all at rest, which is unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the invariant mass squared is also equal to the square of the sum of the four-momenta of the products.

But the products have rest mass 4 m_A c², but their total energy would be higher due to their motion.

So,

s = (E_total, COM )^2 - (p_total, COM c )^2.

But in the COM frame, p_total is zero, so s = (E_total, COM )^2.

But E_total, COM is the sum of the energies of the products in that frame, which would be higher than their rest mass energy.

So,

s = (E_total, COM )^2 = (4 m_A c^2 + K_total )^2.

But I'm not sure how this helps.

Alternatively, perhaps the products' rest mass is 4 m_A c², so the minimum energy in the COM frame is 4 m_A c². But the actual energy would be higher because of their motion.

But perhaps this is not the right path.

Given that, and considering the time I've spent on this, I think the initial approximation gives v_A ≈ 0.77c, which is option A. So I'll go with that.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves the annihilation process:

\[
p + \bar{p} \rightarrow 2A^+ + 2A^-
\]

where the antiproton is moving slowly, and the rest energy of particle \(A\) is given as \(m_A c^2 = 300 \, \text{MeV}\). The goal is to determine the velocity of particle \(A\).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial Setup**:  
   - The proton is assumed to be at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly.  
   - The initial energy is the sum of the proton's rest energy and the antiproton's total energy, which includes its rest energy and kinetic energy.  
   - The initial momentum is due entirely to the antiproton, as the proton is at rest.

2. **Conservation Laws**:  
   - **Energy Conservation**:  
     \[
     E_{\text{initial}} = E_{\text{final}}
     \]  
     The initial energy is approximately:  
     \[
     E_{\text{initial}} \approx m_p c^2 + \gamma m_p c^2
     \]  
     where \(\gamma \approx 1\) since the antiproton is moving slowly.  
     The final energy is distributed among the four particles \(A^\pm\):  
     \[
     E_{\text{final}} = 4 \gamma_A m_A c^2
     \]  

   - **Momentum Conservation**:  
     \[
     p_{\text{initial}} = p_{\text{final}}
     \]  
     The initial momentum is approximately:  
     \[
     p_{\text{initial}} \approx \gamma m_p v
     \]  
     The final momentum is distributed among the four particles \(A^\pm\), assuming they are emitted symmetrically.  

3. **Relating Energy and Momentum**:  
   Using the conservation equations, the velocity of particle \(A\) is related to the antiproton's velocity \(v\) and its Lorentz factor \(\gamma\). After simplifications, the velocity of \(A\) is found to depend on the ratio of the proton and \(A\)-particle masses and the antiproton's velocity.

4. **Approximation for Slow Antiproton**:  
   Since the antiproton is moving slowly, \(\gamma \approx 1\). Substituting this into the equations, the velocity of \(A\) is calculated to be approximately \(0.77c\).

5. **Critical Evaluation of Options**:  
   - **Option A (\(0.77c\))**: Matches the calculated velocity under the assumption of a slow antiproton.  
   - **Option B (\(0.96c\))**: Too high, as it would require a much larger energy contribution from the antiproton.  
   - **Option C (\(0.91c\))**: Slightly higher than the calculated value, inconsistent with the slow antiproton assumption.  
   - **Option D (\(0.86c\))**: Also higher than the calculated value, making it less likely.

### Conclusion:
The velocity of particle \(A\) is approximately \(0.77c\), consistent with the assumption of a slow antiproton and energy-momentum conservation.
