Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says: I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR shows peaks for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to identify the correct 1H NMR data from the options provided.

Hmm. Let's break this down step by step.

First, the compound is a di-substituted benzene ring. So, the ring has two substituents. The total carbon atoms are 8. Wait, because benzene has 6 carbons, so the substituents add 2 more carbons in total. But wait, no. Wait, wait. Oh, wait. Each substituent could contribute to the count. Let me think: benzene is 6 carbons, so if it's di-substituted, each substituent adds some carbons. The total is 8, so substituents have 2 carbons in total. Or, wait, maybe one substituent is a group that has more than one carbon?

Wait, the substituents could be things like two chlorines, but that's 0 carbons each. Or perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group and another is a halogen. Wait, but the FTIR shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. So, the substituents must include both a carbonyl (like a ketone or aldehyde group) and a halogen (like Cl, Br, etc.).

Wait, but wait. The compound is a di-substituted benzene. So substituents are on the benzene ring. Each substituent is a group. Let's think about possible structures.

But first, the molecular structure: the benzene has two substituents. The total number of carbons in the molecule is 8. So, benzene (6 C) plus substituents (2 C) = 8. So each substituent contributes 1 carbon in total. That can't be right because a halogen substituent (like Cl, Br) doesn't add any carbons. So maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group (which could have more than one carbon?), and the other is a halogen.

Wait, let's think: benzene is C6H6. Each substituent replaces a hydrogen. So, if it's di-substituted, the formula becomes C6H4 (R1)(R2). The total carbons are 6 + R1 carbons + R2 carbons. The problem states 8 carbons in total, so 6 + (R1 + R2) =8. So R1 + R2 = 2.

So substituents must contribute 2 carbons in total.

Wait, but if one substituent is a halogen (like Cl, Br, I), it contributes zero carbons. So the other substituent must contribute two carbons. Or, perhaps one substituent is a methyl group (1 C) and the other is a halogen.

Wait, but the IR has a carbonyl group. So one substituent must be a carbonyl group, which implies a ketone, aldehyde, or perhaps an ester or something else.

Wait, but let's think about the carbonyl group. If one substituent is a carbonyl group, like a ketone (R-CO-R'), that would add more carbons. But in a benzene ring, substituents are usually single groups attached. So perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group attached with another part. Let's think of possibilities.

Wait, maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group, like an acetyl group (COCH3), which would add 2 carbons (the CO has one, the CH3 has another). But wait, no, COCH3 is one substituent. Let me see: substituent like -COCH3 would add 2 carbons (the C from CO and the CH3). But if the other substituent is a halogen, which is 0 carbons, then R1 and R2 have a total of 2 carbons (1 from CO, 1 from CH3). Wait, that could fit. Because then, 6 (benzene) + 2 (from substituents) = 8 carbons. So that works.

So the structure would be benzene with two substituents: one is a carbonyl group (like a ketone, maybe para-substituted), and the other is a halogen (like Cl). Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in positions that lead to a particular NMR spectrum.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps the carbonyl is part of an ester group. Or maybe it's a benzoyl group. Hmm.

Alternatively, if one substituent is a carbonyl group attached to another carbon, like a methylene group. Wait, perhaps the substituent is a ketone (like benzophenone?), but that's getting more complicated.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an acetyl group (-COCH3). That's two carbons from the substituent. Then the other substituent could be a halogen (like Cl), which is zero carbons. So total substituent carbons are 2, plus benzene's 6, gives 8. That works.

So the structure would be a benzene ring with one substituent being a Cl and the other being a COCH3 group.

Wait, but wait: where are these substituents located? Since it's di-substituted, the positions could be ortho, meta, or para.

But in the NMR data, we need to see signals that correspond to these groups.

So, in the NMR, the aromatic protons will depend on the substituents. For example, in para-substituted benzene rings, the protons are usually split into two doublets (if there's another substituent in the para position), but wait, if the substituents are ortho, meta, or para, the splitting changes.

Wait, but let's think about the substituents. If the ring has a COCH3 and a Cl group, their positions will affect the NMR.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to think about the possible NMR signals.

The FTIR shows a carbonyl. So in the NMR, the carbonyl group's adjacent protons would show up. Wait, but for an acetyl group, the protons are on the CH3 attached to the carbonyl. So in the NMR, that would be a singlet around 2.1 ppm or so for a CH3 next to a carbonyl.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C has a peak at 2.3 (3H, s), which would fit that. Let me look at option C:

Option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). So that's two doublets in aromatic region and a singlet at 2.3 for 3H.

That would fit a scenario where the ring has substituents that make the aromatic protons split into two doublets. For example, if the substituents are para to each other, the aromatic protons would be in a para position, leading to two doublets each integrating for 2H.

Wait, but wait. If the ring has two substituents that are meta to each other, the aromatic protons would split differently.

Wait, if the substituents are meta, the ring would have more complex splitting, perhaps leading to more than two signals. Alternatively, in para substitution, the substituents are opposite each other, so the aromatic protons would be split into two sets of doublets.

Wait, perhaps the substituent arrangement leads to a para-disubstituted benzene. So, in such a case, the aromatic protons would be in two sets of doublets. For example, each substituent is at para positions, so the ring has two substituents, each in opposite positions.

Wait, but in that case, the ring would have two substituents para to each other, leading the aromatic protons to be in two sets of two protons each, as doublets.

Wait, but let me think about how the NMR would look. Let's say the substituents are a Cl and a COCH3 group in para positions. Then, the ring would have four equivalent protons? No, wait. No, if substituents are para, the ring would have four protons in two sets of doublets.

Wait, no, in a 1,4-disubstituted benzene, the protons would be in two sets of two protons each. For example, if substituents are at positions 1 and 4, then the ring would have protons at positions 2,3,5,6.

Wait, but in that case, each set of protons would be adjacent to substituents, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are both meta to each other, but that might complicate the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in the 1 and 2 positions (ortho). Then the ring would have protons in positions 3,4,5,6. But that would lead to more complex splitting.

Wait, but let me think about the substituents. Let's say the ring has a Cl and a COCH3 group in the para positions.

In that case, the aromatic protons adjacent to the substituents would be deshielded. The substituents are strong deactivating groups, so they would affect the ring's protons.

Wait, but if the substituents are para, the ring would have two protons on each of the two adjacent carbons. So, for example, two protons on each of the two substituents' adjacent positions.

Wait, perhaps that's not the right way to think. Let me think about the structure.

Imagine the benzene ring has a Cl at position 1 and a COCH3 group at position 4 (para). Then, the ring's protons would be at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6.

Each of the substituents would cause the adjacent protons to be deshielded. The Cl is an electron-withdrawing group, which would cause the adjacent protons to be downfield shifted. Similarly, the COCH3 group is also electron-withdrawing, affecting the adjacent protons.

Wait, but when substituents are para, the ring's symmetric. So the protons ortho to Cl would be on carbons 2 and 6, and the protons ortho to COCH3 would be on carbons 3 and 5.

Wait, but in that case, the protons ortho to Cl (positions 2 and 6) would be equivalent, and the protons ortho to COCH3 (positions 3 and 5) would be equivalent.

So in NMR, you would see two doublets: one for the protons next to Cl (let's say 2 and 6), and another for the protons next to COCH3 (3 and 5). Each of these would be doublets because each proton is adjacent to substituents which cause splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps each set is a double doublet, but in reality, symmetry can lead to simpler splitting.

Wait, but perhaps the substituents are at para positions, leading to each pair of aromatic protons being equivalent. So the NMR would show two doublets, each integrating for two protons.

So in the NMR data, for aromatic region, two doublets: one at higher ppm (say around 7.8, integrating for 2H) and another at lower ppm (like 7.6, integrating for 2H), which matches option C.

Option C is: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). The 2.3 ppm peak is likely the CH3 attached to the carbonyl group, as in COCH3.

So that would fit. Additionally, the FTIR would show a strong carbonyl peak (around 1700 cm^-1), and the aromatic-halogen C-Br or C-Cl stretch around 600 cm^-1.

Wait, but is there any other possibility? Let's look at the other options.

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s). The singlet at 9.9 ppm is very high, perhaps an aldehyde proton. But the problem states that the compound is di-substituted with a carbonyl and a halogen. So if there's an aldehyde group, that's a carbonyl, but then where is the halogen? But wait, the substituents would be aldehyde and halogen, but that would require more carbons. Wait, benzene has 6, substituents are aldehyde (CHO) and Cl. CHO is one substituent (0 carbons beyond the ring?), wait, no: wait, the aldehyde is -CHO, which is a substituent with one carbon (the CHO group is -CHO, so the substituent is one carbon). Wait, that's one substituent, and the other is Cl. So substituents contribute one carbon in total. Then the total would be 6 +1 =7, but the problem says 8. So that can't fit. So option A is unlikely.

Option B: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s). These look like protons from an ethyl group adjacent to an oxygen, perhaps in an acetal or something. But where's the carbonyl? Maybe an ester group, but I'm not sure. Also, the IR has a carbonyl, so an ester would have a carbonyl. But the aromatic ring would need to have substituents. But the NMR doesn't show any aromatic protons, which is confusing because the compound is a di-substituted benzene. So, this option probably isn't correct.

Option D: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s). The singlet at 6.9 could be an aromatic proton, but why only one? If the substituents are in such a way that only one aromatic proton remains, but that seems unlikely in a disubstituted benzene. Also, the other signals suggest something like an ethylene group adjacent to oxygen, perhaps an ether or ester. But again, not seeing the aromatic protons as expected. So this option might not fit.

So that brings me back to option C. So, the correct NMR would have two doublets in the aromatic region and a singlet for the CH3 attached to the carbonyl group.

Wait, but let me think about the substituents. If the substituents are para, the aromatic protons would be in two sets of two, each as a doublet. So in the NMR, two doublets integrating for 2H each. That's what option C shows: 7.8 (d, 2H) and 7.6 (d, 2H).

So that would make sense. So the structure is 1-chloro-4-acetylbenzene or something similar.

Wait, but what would the splitting look like. Each aromatic proton adjacent to a substituent would be split into a doublet. So the two protons ortho to Cl would be a doublet, and the two protons ortho to COCH3 would be another doublet.

So yes, that's what option C shows.

Another possibility is that the substituents are in the meta positions, but that would lead to more complex splitting, perhaps a triplet or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in the ortho positions. Then, the aromatic protons might show as a triplet or something else, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are such that the ring becomes meta substituted, leading to different splitting.

Wait, but the NMR data in option C suggests two doublets. That's typical of a para-substituted benzene with two strong substituents that are deactivating. Because in that case, each set of protons is equivalent and split into a doublet.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are a carbonyl (like COCH3) and Cl, and they are para.

So the NMR would have the aromatic protons as two doublets, each two H, and the COCH3 group as a singlet at ~2.3 ppm.

Therefore, the correct NMR is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with a total of 8 carbon atoms. This means the benzene ring (6 carbons) has two substituents contributing a total of 2 carbons. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond, suggesting the substituents are likely a carbonyl-containing group (e.g., -COCH₃) and a halogen (e.g., Cl).

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A**:  
   - Peaks: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s).  
   - The singlet at 9.9 ppm suggests an aldehyde proton, but this would require one substituent to be an aldehyde (-CHO). However, the total number of carbons would not match the given 8 carbons. This option is inconsistent with the problem.

2. **Option B**:  
   - Peaks: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s).  
   - These signals suggest protons from an ethyl group adjacent to an oxygen, but there is no evidence of aromatic protons in the spectrum. This contradicts the fact that the compound is a di-substituted benzene ring. This option is incorrect.

3. **Option C**:  
   - Peaks: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s).  
   - The two doublets in the aromatic region (7.8 and 7.6 ppm) indicate a para-substituted benzene ring with two strong deactivating groups (e.g., -COCH₃ and -Cl). The singlet at 2.3 ppm corresponds to the CH₃ group attached to the carbonyl. This matches the expected NMR pattern for a para-substituted benzene with a carbonyl and halogen substituent. This option is consistent with the problem.

4. **Option D**:  
   - Peaks: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s).  
   - The singlet at 6.9 ppm suggests an isolated aromatic proton, which is unlikely for a di-substituted benzene. Additionally, the other signals suggest an ethyl group adjacent to oxygen, but there is no evidence of a carbonyl group. This option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct NMR data corresponds to Option C, which matches the expected pattern for a para-substituted benzene with a carbonyl group (-COCH₃) and a halogen (-Cl) as substituents. The two doublets in the aromatic region correspond to the protons ortho to the substituents, and the singlet at 2.3 ppm corresponds to the CH₃ group attached to the carbonyl.

Answer: C

Wait, but is there any other possibility? Let's look at the other options.

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s). The singlet at 9.9 ppm is very high, perhaps an aldehyde proton. But the problem states that the compound is di-substituted with a carbonyl and a halogen. So if there's an aldehyde group, that's a carbonyl, but then where is the halogen?

So option A is unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in the ortho positions. Then, the aromatic protons might show as a triplet or something else, but I'm not certain.

Therefore, the correct NMR is option C.

   - These signals suggest protons from an ethyl group adjacent to an oxygen, but there is no evidence of aromatic protons in the spectrum. This contradicts the fact that the compound is a di-substituted benzene ring. This option is incorrect.

3. **Option C**:  
   - Peaks: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s).  
   - The two doublets in the aromatic region (7.8 and 7.6 ppm) indicate a para-substituted benzene ring with two strong deactivating groups (e.g., -COCH₃ and -Cl). The singlet at 2.3 ppm corresponds to the CH₃ group attached to the carbonyl. This matches the expected NMR pattern for a para-substituted benzene with a carbonyl and halogen substituent. This option is consistent with the problem.

4. **Option D**:  
   - Peaks: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s).  
   - The singlet at 6.9 ppm suggests an isolated aromatic proton, which is unlikely for a di-substituted benzene. Additionally, the other signals suggest an ethyl group adjacent to oxygen, but there is no evidence of a carbonyl group. This option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct NMR data corresponds to Option C, which matches the expected pattern for a para-substituted benzene with a carbonyl group (-COCH₃) and a halogen (-Cl) as substituents. The two doublets in the aromatic region correspond to the protons ortho to the substituents, and the singlet at 2.3 ppm corresponds to the CH₃ group attached to the carbonyl.
