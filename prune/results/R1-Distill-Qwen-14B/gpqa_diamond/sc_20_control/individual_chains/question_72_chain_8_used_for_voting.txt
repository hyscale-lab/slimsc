Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. It's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what each part does and try to visualize the structures.

The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Hmm, bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is a norbornane structure. The substituent here is a tert-butoxy group at position 7. So that's a bulky substituent attached to the norbornane.

Next, it's combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Oh wait, sodium iodide is a good nucleophile source. And when you have dibromomethyl groups, that's like two leaving groups attached to a cyclohexene ring.

So, the reaction here might be a Diels-Alder or an addition reaction? Wait, wait, the diene could be reacting. Alternatively, since there's a dienophile. Or perhaps it's an elimination or substitution. Another thought: the cyclohexa-1,3-diene has two dibromomethyl groups on carbons 5 and 6. So, maybe this is a dienophile?

Wait, norbornene derivatives can act as dienes in Diels-Alder reactions. Alternatively, considering the presence of iodide ions, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution? Like an SN2 reaction. Because the dibromomethyl groups have good leaving groups (bromide), and the sodium iodide would provide iodide ions as nucleophiles.

Wait, but wait, if the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)..., the structure is a bicyclic compound with an ether group. Maybe the tert-butoxy group is a good leaving group? Or perhaps it's a diene that's getting added into.

Wait, the 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene... Let me think. The cyclohexene has two substituents: each is a (dibromomethyl) group. So, each is a CH2Br2 group attached to C5 and C6.

Wait, so when you have 2 equivalents of that, perhaps each of the dibromomethyl groups undergoes substitution. Let me think: if I have a molecule with two -CH2Br2 groups, and I have a strong nucleophile like I-, perhaps each of the Br's is replaced by iodide? But that doesn't seem to make much sense because the molecule would become more substituted with iodide.

Alternatively, maybe the cyclohexene is the dienophile and the norbornene (bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene) is the diene. So, a Diels-Alder reaction occurs. Wait, the diene is the bicyclo compound, and the cyclohexadiene is the dienophile? Or perhaps the norbornene is the dienophile.

Wait, norbornene has a strained structure, which makes it a good dienophile. So, in a Diels-Alder reaction, the bicyclo structure (dienophile) would react with a diene (like the 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene? Wait, no, that's a diene itself.

Wait, the cyclohexa-1,3-diene is a conjugated diene, so perhaps it's the diene in a Diels-Alder reaction, and the norbornene (bicyclo) is the dienophile. But wait, the norbornene is a diene as well; that's confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition between the norbornene (as dienophile) and the cyclohexadiene (as diene), but that doesn't make much sense because the norbornene is a seven-membered system.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the reaction conditions. The problem states that 2 equivalents of the cyclohexadiene are used. So, maybe each equivalent reacts once. But wait, the product is product 1. Perhaps it's a diels-alder reaction where two equivalents add.

Alternatively, maybe each dibromomethyl group is undergoing substitution. So, each CH2Br2 is a leaving group, and the iodide comes in. But each methyl group has two bromines, so maybe substitution at each position.

Wait, but substitution would require each Br to be replaced by iodide. But each methyl has two Br atoms. So, perhaps each CH2Br2 becomes CH2I2? But that's unlikely because CH2I2 is not very stable. Maybe the I- is acting as a nucleophile, but in such a case, the substitution would occur at each CH2Br2 group, replacing one Br with I. But wait, the structure is CH2Br2, so each has two leaving groups. Maybe it's a double substitution, but that would lead to CH2I2, which is not common.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexadiene is a dienophile. But maybe I should think about this differently. Another possibility is that the bicyclo compound is undergoing some kind of ring-opening.

Wait, the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. So, it's a norbornene derivative with a bulky substituent. The reaction with the cyclohexadiene and sodium iodide — perhaps it's a ring-opening via nucleophilic attack.

Wait, another thought: the cyclohexadiene has two dibromomethyl groups. Maybe those are leaving groups, and the iodide is substituting in. But in what way?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a 1,4-addition across the double bonds. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's a conjugate addition. The bicyclo structure has a diene, so maybe it's the diene in a conjugate addition with the cyclohexadiene acting as a dienophile. Or maybe the other way around.

Alternatively, considering this is a Diels-Alder reaction, the diene (cyclohexadiene) would react with the dienophile (norbornene). So, the norbornene is the dienophile, and the cyclohexadiene is the diene. Then, product 1 would be the adduct of the Diels-Alder reaction.

Wait, but how many equivalents are used? The cyclohexadiene is used in 2 equivalents. So, perhaps each equivalent forms a bridge structure. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps each equivalent adds to the norbornene.

But norbornene has two double bonds? No, actually, norbornene has one double bond. So, perhaps each Diels-Alder would use one equivalent of diene and one of dienophile. But the problem says two equivalents of the cyclohexadiene are used. So, perhaps two Diels-Alder adducts form, but that seems unlikely because the dienophile would be used up.

Wait, perhaps the norbornene is the dienophile, and each cyclohexadiene is a diene, so two Diels-Alder adducts form. But I'm not too sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening of the norbornene. The tert-butoxy group is a good leaving group, so perhaps under these conditions, the ring opens. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: after the first reaction, product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid to form product 2. Then product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO to form product 3. Finally, product 3 is heated to form the final product 4. The question is about the number of chemically distinct hydrogens in product 4.

So, maybe the overall process is adding some groups and then doing some functional group transformations.

Let me think about the first step again. So, the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene.

Then, it's reacted with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and NaI.

Wait a minute, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene has two CH2Br2 groups. So, each of those positions has two bromine atoms attached to a methyl group.

I think when NaI is present, the bromide ions are good leaving groups, so substitution reactions can occur. But in this case, the iodide would come in. Now, each CH2Br2 group has two bromines. So, perhaps each Br is replaced by iodide. Wait, but that would require two equivalents of iodide per CH2Br2 group. But since each group has two bromines, perhaps each can react with two equivalents of I-.

But the problem states that two equivalents of the cyclohexadiene are used. Wait, but each cyclohexadiene has two CH2Br2 groups. So, if each diene molecule has two CH2Br2 groups, and two equivalents of diene are used, that would be four CH2Br2 groups in total. Hmm, but the starting material has two equivalents of diene, so perhaps each diene molecule has two CH2Br2 groups, so each can undergo substitution twice.

Wait, but the starting material (7-(tert-butoxy)...) is one molecule. So, when reacting with two equivalents of cyclohexadiene and NaI, perhaps each cyclohexadiene molecule is reacting once.

Alternatively, perhaps each of the CH2Br2 groups in the diene is undergoing substitution with iodide. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the cyclohexadiene is acting as a dienophile, and the norbornene is the diene. So, the Diels-Alder would form a six-membered ring adduct.

Wait, but norbornene is a bicyclic compound. So, the Diels-Alder would form a bridge structure, perhaps adding across one of the double bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps the diene is the norbornene, and the cyclohexadiene is the dienophile. Hmm.

I think I'm getting stuck on the first reaction. Maybe I should move on and think about the subsequent steps to see if that gives any clues.

So, product 1 is treated with aqueous H2SO4 to form product 2. Then, product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO, which sounds like a sulfonation or perhaps a sulfonamide formation. Wait, DMSO and SO3 with pyridine is often used for the Swern oxidation, but that's for oxidizing alcohols to ketones. Alternatively, it could be a sulfonation reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: SO3 in DMSO with pyridine is used for the preparation of sulfonamides, but if product 2 has an amine, perhaps. Alternatively, perhaps it's a sulfonating agent. But product 2 comes from treating product 1 with aqueous sulfuric acid.

Wait, maybe product 1 has some epoxide groups, and treating with H2SO4 would open them. Alternatively, if product 1 is a diene, aqueous H2SO4 might protonate the double bond.

But I'm not making much progress here. Maybe I should consider the possible structures.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction is a 1,4-conjugate addition. The norbornene has a diene, and the cyclohexadiene is a dienophile. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the first reaction is a ring-opening of the norbornene. The tert-butoxy group is a good leaving group. So, perhaps the norbornene undergoes ring-opening to form a diradical or a diol, but that's a stretch.

Another approach: think about the possible products. The overall process seems to involve adding substituents and then functional group transformations.

Wait, perhaps the first step is a Diels-Alder reaction. So, the bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene is the diene, and the cyclohexa-1,3-diene is the dienophile. Wait, but the dienophile usually has a double bond that's electron-deficient.

Alternatively, the cyclohexadiene is a diene, and the norbornene is the dienophile. So, the Diels-Alder would form a six-membered ring.

But norbornene has a bridge structure. Hmm. Maybe the reaction is a Diels-Alder where the dienophile is the norbornene. So, the norbornene's double bond would react with the diene (cyclohexadiene). But I'm not sure about the regiochemistry here.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexadiene is a diene with two double bonds, but that's not the case. It's a single conjugated diene.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a [4+4] cycloaddition, but that's less common and usually not under thermal conditions.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening metathesis, but that's probably not the case here.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. Let me think of the overall structure.

Let me try to imagine the Diels-Alder reaction. Suppose the norbornene is the dienophile. Then, the diene is the cyclohexadiene. So, the cyclohexadiene has a conjugated diene, which would attack the dienophile (norbornene).

Wait, in a Diels-Alder reaction, the diene is the conjugated four-pi-electron system, and the dienophile is a two-pi-electron system (like a double bond). So, the norbornene (bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene) has two double bonds, but that's a bit unusual for a dienophile. Or maybe it's a mono-dienophile, like a single double bond.

Wait, maybe the norbornene has one double bond, and the cyclohexadiene is the diene. So, the Diels-Alder would form a bridge structure. The product would have a six-membered ring with substituents.

Since two equivalents of the diene are used, perhaps two Diels-Alder adducts form, or maybe the dienophile can react in two different positions.

Alternatively, perhaps each equivalent of diene adds to a different position on the norbornene.

Wait, but the norbornene has one double bond. So, each Diels-Alder would require one diene and one dienophile. So, with two equivalents of diene, perhaps two Diels-Alder adducts are formed, but that would require two dienophiles. But the starting material is only one equivalent of the bicyclo compound.

Hmm, perhaps it's a 1,4-addition or some other type of addition.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Michael addition, but I'm not sure.

I think I'm stuck on the first step. Maybe I should think about the other steps and see if that gives any clues.

Product 1, after treatment with aqueous H2SO4, forms product 2. Then, product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO, forming product 3. Finally, product 3 is heated to form product 4.

So, let's think about what each step could be.

Treated with aqueous H2SO4: perhaps acid-catalyzed ring-opening or hydrolysis. For example, if product 1 has an epoxide group, H2SO4 could open it. Or perhaps it's a Birch reduction, but that's with metal and ammonia.

Alternatively, if product 1 has a carbonyl group, H2SO4 might lead to some kind of hydration or rearrangement.

Then, treating with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO: this sounds like a sulfonation reaction. Sulfur trioxide is a sulfonating agent. Pyridine is a base, which can help in the reaction. So, perhaps product 2 has a phenol group, and product 3 is the sulfonated derivative. Alternatively, if product 2 has an alcohol group, perhaps it's being converted into a sulfate ester.

Wait, but if product 2 has an alcohol, treating with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO would sulfonate it. So, product 3 would have a sulfonate group. Then, when heated, product 3 could undergo elimination or rearrangement.

Alternatively, if product 2 has an amine, perhaps it's being sulfonated to form a sulfonamide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: product 2 might have an epoxide, and SO3 in DMSO could open it. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diiodide, and product 2 is an alcohol after hydrolysis.

Wait, considering the first reaction involved NaI. So, perhaps in the first step, substitution occurs, replacing Br with I.

So, the cyclohexadiene with two CH2Br2 groups reacts with NaI, replacing each Br with I. So each CH2Br2 becomes CH2I2. But CH2I2 is not stable, so perhaps it's more likely that each CH2Br2 group loses one Br and gains one I, becoming CH2BrI. But that's a possibility.

Wait, but with two equivalents of the diene, each with two CH2Br2 groups, that's four Br atoms in total. Each Br could be substituted by I. So, product 1 would have four I atoms attached to methyl groups.

Then, product 1 is treated with aqueous H2SO4, which might hydrolyze the CH2I groups. CH2I is a good leaving group, but in acidic conditions, perhaps it's hydrolyzed to -CH2OH. So, each CH2I would become CH2OH. So, product 2 would have four CH2OH groups.

Then, product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO. If product 2 has multiple CH2OH groups, treating with SO3 would sulfonate the alcohols. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the SO3 in DMSO is used for oxidation. For example, oxidizing alcohols to ketones or sulfonating them.

Wait, if product 2 has CH2OH groups, treating with SO3 might form sulfonate esters. But I'm not too familiar with that reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2OH groups are oxidized. Sulfur trioxide is a strong oxidizing agent. So, maybe the secondary alcohols (if present) are oxidized to ketones. But if the CH2OH groups are primary, they might get oxidized to carboxylic acids, but that requires more vigorous conditions.

Wait, perhaps the CH2OH groups are converted into good leaving groups. For example, tosylates or similar. But that would require treatment with a tosyl chloride, which isn't the case here.

Hmm, another possibility: product 2 has some double bonds. Then, treating with SO3, which is a dehydrating agent, might cause elimination.

Wait, if product 2 has vicinal diols (like from epoxide opening), then heating with SO3 and pyridine could cause them to form an ether or eliminate to form a double bond.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diiodide, product 2 is a diol (from hydrolysis), and product 3 is a sulfonated compound, perhaps.

But I'm not making progress. Let me try to think about the final step. Product 3 is heated at 150°C to form product 4. Heating can lead to elimination reactions, like dehydration or dehydrohalogenation.

So, perhaps product 3 has some leaving groups, and heating causes elimination, forming double bonds or rings.

Putting this all together, maybe the process is as follows:

1. The first reaction adds iodide groups to the cyclohexadiene, perhaps substituting the bromides.

2. Then, in acidic conditions, these iodide groups are hydrolyzed to hydroxyl groups.

3. Then, the hydroxyl groups are converted into good leaving groups (like sulfonates) in the next step.

4. Finally, heating causes elimination, forming rings or double bonds.

But I'm not exactly sure. Let me try to sketch a possible structure.

Assuming the first reaction is a Diels-Alder between the norbornene and the cyclohexadiene.

The norbornene (dienophile) would react with the cyclohexadiene (dien) in a Diels-Alder reaction. The product would be a bicyclic structure with substituents from the diene.

But considering two equivalents of the diene, perhaps two Diels-Alder adducts form, or perhaps the diene adds twice.

Alternatively, perhaps the norbornene reacts in a way that forms two new rings.

Wait, but I think I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the first reaction is adding iodide groups to the norbornene. But that doesn't seem likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the tert-butoxy group is replaced by something else.

Wait, perhaps the norbornene has a diene, which can undergo addition with the diene (cyclohexadiene) in a [4+4] cycloaddition, but that's not common.

Alternatively, perhaps the norbornene's double bond reacts with the cyclohexadiene in a way that forms a bridge.

But I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should think about the possible final structure.

The question is about the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4.

Assuming that product 4 is a highly symmetric molecule, perhaps with multiple identical substituents.

If the final product is a norbornene derivative with some substituents added in symmetric positions, the number of distinct hydrogens would depend on the symmetry.

For example, norbornene itself has 7 hydrogen atoms. If substituents are added symmetrically, the number of distinct hydrogens would be fewer.

But considering the steps, perhaps product 4 is a molecule with several identical groups, leading to fewer distinct hydrogens.

Wait, another approach: think about the possible formation of a cubane or a highly symmetric structure. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a tricyclic compound with several bridgehead substituents.

Wait, but without knowing the exact structures, it's hard to say. Maybe I should think of the options given.

The options are A)8, B)4, C)10, D)7.

I think the correct answer is likely D)7, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, considering the starting material's bicyclo structure, which already has some symmetry, adding substituents symmetrically would reduce the number of distinct hydrogens.

But wait, the starting material has a tert-butoxy group, which is bulky and possibly asymmetric. So, adding substituents around it could create more distinct hydrogens.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product has several equivalent protons due to symmetry.

Wait, another possibility: the final product is a norbornane (bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane) with several substituents. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, the number of distinct hydrogens would be fewer.

Norbornane has bridgehead hydrogens and other equivalent positions. For example, in norbornane, there are three types of hydrogens: bridgehead (two equivalent), and others.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product has a structure that leads to 8 distinct hydrogens. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, I'm stuck. I'll have to make a guess based on the options and the process.

Wait, let's think about the heating step. If product 3 is a sulfonated diol, heating could cause elimination, forming rings or double bonds. So, product 4 might be a more aromatic or conjugated structure, which could have fewer hydrogen atoms due to more symmetry.

But without the exact structures, it's really hard to tell. I'll have to go with my initial thought that the answer is D)7.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. The analysis of each step is as follows:

1. **First Reaction**: The starting material reacts with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide. This step likely involves substitution reactions where bromine atoms in the dibromomethyl groups are replaced by iodine atoms, forming product 1. The tert-butoxy group on the norbornene structure may remain intact.

2. **Second Reaction**: Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid, leading to product 2. This step could involve hydrolysis of the iodide groups formed in the first step, potentially converting them into hydroxyl groups or other functional groups.

3. **Third Reaction**: Product 2 is treated with SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO, forming product 3. This step likely introduces sulfonate groups or modifies existing functional groups, such as hydroxyl groups, into better leaving groups or sulfonated derivatives.

4. **Final Reaction**: Product 3 is heated at 150°C to form the final product 4. This step likely involves elimination or rearrangement, potentially forming a more conjugated or aromatic structure with increased symmetry.

The final product 4 is analyzed for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms. Considering the symmetry of the norbornene structure and the transformations described, the final product likely retains some symmetry, reducing the number of distinct hydrogen atoms. Based on the reasoning and the options provided, the most plausible answer is **7 distinct hydrogen atoms**.

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. It's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what each part does and try to visualize the structures.

The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Hmm, bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is a norbornane structure. The substituent here is a tert-butoxy group at position 7. So that's a bulky substituent attached to the norbornane.

Next, it's combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Oh wait, sodium iodide is a good nucleophile source. And when you have dibromomethyl groups, that's like two leaving groups attached to a cyclohexene ring.

So, the reaction here might be a Diels-Alder or an addition reaction? Wait, wait, the diene could be reacting. Alternatively, since there's a dienophile. Or perhaps it's an elimination or substitution. Another thought: the cyclohexa-1,3-diene has two dibromomethyl groups on carbons 5 and 6. So, maybe this is a dienophile?

Wait, norbornene derivatives can act as dienes in Diels-Alder reactions. Alternatively, considering the presence of iodide ions, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution? Like an SN2 reaction. Because the dibromomethyl groups have good leaving groups (bromide), and the sodium iodide would provide iodide ions as nucleophiles.

Wait, but wait, if the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)..., the structure is a bicyclic compound with an ether group. Maybe the tert-butoxy group is a good leaving group? Or perhaps it's a diene that's getting added into.

Wait, the 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene... Let me think. The cyclohexene has two substituents: each is a (dibromomethyl) group. So, each is a CH2Br2 group attached to C5 and C6.

Wait, so when you have 2 equivalents of that, perhaps each of the dibromomethyl groups undergoes substitution. Let me think: if I have a molecule with two -CH2Br2 groups, and I have a strong nucleophile like I-, perhaps each of the Br's is replaced by iodide? But that doesn't seem to make much sense because the molecule would become more substituted with iodide.

Alternatively, maybe the cyclohexene is the dienophile and the norbornene (bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene) is the diene. So, a Diels-Alder reaction occurs. Wait, the diene is the bicyclo compound, and the cyclohexadiene is the dienophile? Or perhaps the norbornene is the dienophile.

Wait, norbornene has a strained structure, which makes it a good dienophile. So, in a Diels-Alder reaction, the bicyclo structure (dienophile) would react with a diene (like the 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene? Wait, no, that's a diene itself.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the reaction conditions. The problem states that 2 equivalents of the cyclohexadiene are used. So, maybe each equivalent reacts once. But wait, the product is product 1. Perhaps it's a diels-alder reaction where two equivalents add.

Alternatively, maybe each dibromomethyl group is undergoing substitution. So, each CH2Br2 is a leaving group, and the iodide comes in. But each methyl group has two bromines, so maybe substitution at each position.

Wait, but substitution would require each Br to be replaced by iodide. But each methyl has two Br atoms. So, perhaps each CH2Br2 becomes CH2I2? But that's unlikely because CH2I2 is not very stable. Maybe the I- is acting as a nucleophile, but in such a case, the substitution would occur at each CH2Br2 group, replacing one Br with I. But wait, the structure is CH2Br2, so each has two leaving groups. Maybe it's a double substitution, but that would lead to CH2I2, which is not common.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexadiene is a dienophile. But maybe I should think about this differently. Another possibility is that the bicyclo compound is undergoing some kind of ring-opening.

Wait, the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. So, it's a norbornene derivative with a bulky substituent. The reaction with the cyclohexadiene and sodium iodide — perhaps it's a ring-opening via nucleophilic attack.

Wait, another thought: the cyclohexadiene has two dibromomethyl groups. Maybe those are leaving groups, and the iodide is substituting in. But in what way?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a 1,4-addition across the double bonds. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's a conjugate addition. The bicyclo structure has a diene, so maybe it's the diene in a conjugate addition with the cyclohexadiene acting as a dienophile. Or maybe the other way around.

Alternatively, considering this is a Diels-Alder reaction, the diene (cyclohexadiene) would react with the dienophile (norbornene). So, the norbornene is the dienophile, and the cyclohexadiene is the diene. Then, product 1 would be the adduct of the Diels-Alder reaction.

Wait, but how many equivalents are used? The cyclohexadiene is used in 2 equivalents. So, perhaps each equivalent forms a bridge structure. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps each equivalent adds to the norbornene.

But norbornene has two double bonds? No, actually, norbornene has one double bond. So, perhaps each Diels-Alder would use one equivalent of diene and one of dienophile. But the problem says two equivalents of the cyclohexadiene are used. So, perhaps two Diels-Alder adducts form, but that seems unlikely because the dienophile would be used up.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening of the norbornene. The tert-butoxy group is a good leaving group, so perhaps under these conditions, the ring opens. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: after the first reaction, product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid to form product 2. Then product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO to form product 3. Finally, product 3 is heated to form the final product 4. The question is about the number of chemically distinct hydrogens in product 4.

So, maybe the overall process is adding some groups and then doing some functional group transformations.

Let me think about the first step again. So, the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene.

Then, it's reacted with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and NaI.

Wait a minute, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene has two CH2Br2 groups. So, each of those positions has two bromine atoms attached to a methyl group.

I think when NaI is present, the bromide ions are good leaving groups, so substitution reactions can occur. But in this case, the iodide would come in. Now, each CH2Br2 group has two bromines. So, perhaps each Br is replaced by iodide. Wait, but that would require two equivalents of iodide per CH2Br2 group. But since each group has two bromines, perhaps each can react with two equivalents of I-.

But the problem states that two equivalents of the cyclohexadiene are used. Wait, but each cyclohexadiene has two CH2Br2 groups. So, if each diene molecule has two CH2Br2 groups, and two equivalents of diene are used, that would be four CH2Br2 groups in total. Hmm, but the starting material has two equivalents of diene, so perhaps each diene molecule has two CH2Br2 groups, so each can undergo substitution twice.

Wait, but the starting material (7-(tert-butoxy)...) is one molecule. So, when reacting with two equivalents of cyclohexadiene and NaI, perhaps each cyclohexadiene molecule is reacting once.

Alternatively, perhaps each of the CH2Br2 groups in the diene is undergoing substitution with iodide. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the cyclohexadiene is acting as a dienophile, and the norbornene is the diene. So, the Diels-Alder would form a six-membered ring adduct.

Wait, but norbornene is a bicyclic compound. So, the Diels-Alder would form a bridge structure, perhaps adding across one of the double bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps the diene is the norbornene, and the cyclohexadiene is the dienophile. Hmm.

I think I'm getting stuck on the first reaction. Maybe I should move on and think about the subsequent steps to see if that gives any clues.

So, product 1 is treated with aqueous H2SO4 to form product 2. Then, product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO, which sounds like a sulfonation or perhaps a sulfonamide formation. Wait, DMSO and SO3 with pyridine is often used for the Swern oxidation, but that's for oxidizing alcohols to ketones. Alternatively, it could be a sulfonation reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: SO3 in DMSO with pyridine is used for the preparation of sulfonamides, but if product 2 has an amine, perhaps. Alternatively, perhaps it's a sulfonating agent. But product 2 comes from treating product 1 with aqueous sulfuric acid.

Wait, maybe product 1 has some epoxide groups, and treating with H2SO4 would open them. Alternatively, if product 1 is a diene, aqueous H2SO4 might protonate the double bond.

But I'm not making much progress here. Maybe I should consider the possible structures.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction is a 1,4-conjugate addition. The norbornene has a diene, and the cyclohexadiene is a dienophile. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the first reaction is a ring-opening of the norbornene. The tert-butoxy group is a good leaving group. So, perhaps the norbornene undergoes ring-opening to form a diradical or a diol, but that's a stretch.

Another approach: think about the possible products. The overall process seems to involve adding substituents and then functional group transformations.

Wait, perhaps the first step is a Diels-Alder reaction. So, the bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene is the diene, and the cyclohexa-1,3-diene is the dienophile. Wait, but the dienophile usually has a double bond that's electron-deficient.

Alternatively, the cyclohexadiene is a diene, and the norbornene is the dienophile. So, the Diels-Alder would form a six-membered ring.

But norbornene has a bridge structure. Hmm. Maybe the reaction is a Diels-Alder where the dienophile is the norbornene. So, the norbornene's double bond would react with the diene (cyclohexadiene). But I'm not sure about the regiochemistry here.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexadiene is a diene with two double bonds, but that's not the case. It's a single conjugated diene.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a [4+4] cycloaddition, but that's less common and usually not under thermal conditions.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening metathesis, but that's probably not the case here.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. Let me think of the overall structure.

Let me try to imagine the Diels-Alder reaction. Suppose the norbornene is the dienophile. Then, the diene is the cyclohexadiene. So, the cyclohexadiene has a conjugated diene, which would attack the dienophile (norbornene).

Wait, in a Diels-Alder reaction, the diene is the conjugated four-pi-electron system, and the dienophile is a two-pi-electron system (like a double bond). So, the norbornene (bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene) has two double bonds, but that's a bit unusual for a dienophile. Or maybe it's a mono-dienophile, like a single double bond.

Wait, maybe the norbornene has one double bond, and the cyclohexadiene is the diene. So, the Diels-Alder would form a bridge structure. The product would have a six-membered ring with substituents.

Since two equivalents of the diene are used, perhaps two Diels-Alder adducts form, or maybe the dienophile can react in two different positions.

Alternatively, perhaps each equivalent of diene adds to a different position on the norbornene.

Wait, but the norbornene has one double bond. So, each Diels-Alder would require one diene and one dienophile. So, with two equivalents of diene, perhaps two Diels-Alder adducts are formed, but that would require two dienophiles. But the starting material is only one equivalent of the bicyclo compound.

Hmm, perhaps it's a 1,4-addition or some other type of addition.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Michael addition, but I'm not sure.

I think I'm stuck on the first step. Maybe I should think about the other steps and see if that gives any clues.

Product 1, after treatment with aqueous H2SO4, forms product 2. Then, product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO, forming product 3. Finally, product 3 is heated to form product 4.

So, let's think about what each step could be.

Treated with aqueous H2SO4: perhaps acid-catalyzed ring-opening or hydrolysis. For example, if product 1 has an epoxide group, H2SO4 could open it. Or perhaps it's a Birch reduction, but that's with metal and ammonia.

Alternatively, if product 1 has a carbonyl group, H2SO4 might lead to some kind of hydration or rearrangement.

Then, treating with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO: this sounds like a sulfonation reaction. Sulfur trioxide is a sulfonating agent. Pyridine is a base, which can help in the reaction. So, perhaps product 2 has a phenol group, and product 3 is the sulfonated derivative. Alternatively, if product 2 has an alcohol group, perhaps it's being converted into a sulfate ester.

Wait, but if product 2 has an alcohol, treating with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO would sulfonate it. So, product 3 would have a sulfonate group. Then, when heated, product 3 could undergo elimination or rearrangement.

Alternatively, if product 2 has an amine, perhaps it's being sulfonated to form a sulfonamide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: product 2 might have an epoxide, and SO3 in DMSO could open it. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diiodide, and product 2 is an alcohol after hydrolysis.

Wait, considering the first reaction involved NaI. So, perhaps in the first step, substitution occurs, replacing Br with I.

So, the cyclohexadiene with two CH2Br2 groups reacts with NaI, replacing each Br with I. So each CH2Br2 becomes CH2I2. But CH2I2 is not stable, so perhaps it's more likely that each CH2Br2 group loses one Br and gains one I, becoming CH2BrI. But that's a possibility.

Wait, but with two equivalents of the diene, each with two CH2Br2 groups, that's four Br atoms in total. Each Br could be substituted by I. So, product 1 would have four I atoms attached to methyl groups.

Then, product 1 is treated with aqueous H2SO4, which might hydrolyze the CH2I groups. CH2I is a good leaving group, but in acidic conditions, perhaps it's hydrolyzed to -CH2OH. So, each CH2I would become CH2OH. So, product 2 would have four CH2OH groups.

Then, product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO. If product 2 has multiple CH2OH groups, treating with SO3 would sulfonate the alcohols. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the SO3 in DMSO is used for oxidation. For example, oxidizing alcohols to ketones or sulfonating them.

Wait, if product 2 has CH2OH groups, treating with SO3 might form sulfonate esters. But I'm not too familiar with that reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2OH groups are oxidized. Sulfur trioxide is a strong oxidizing agent. So, maybe the secondary alcohols (if present) are oxidized to ketones. But if the CH2OH groups are primary, they might get oxidized to carboxylic acids, but that requires more vigorous conditions.

Wait, perhaps the CH2OH groups are converted into good leaving groups. For example, tosylates or similar. But that would require treatment with a tosyl chloride, which isn't the case here.

Hmm, another possibility: product 2 has some double bonds. Then, treating with SO3, which is a dehydrating agent, might cause elimination.

Wait, if product 2 has vicinal diols (like from epoxide opening), then heating with SO3 and pyridine could cause them to form an ether or eliminate to form a double bond.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diiodide, product 2 is a diol (from hydrolysis), and product 3 is a sulfonated compound, perhaps.

But I'm not making progress. Let me try to think about the final step. Product 3 is heated at 150°C to form product 4. Heating can lead to elimination reactions, like dehydration or dehydrohalogenation.

So, perhaps product 3 has some leaving groups, and heating causes elimination, forming double bonds or rings.

Putting this all together, maybe the process is as follows:

1. The first reaction adds iodide groups to the cyclohexadiene, perhaps substituting the bromides.

2. Then, in acidic conditions, these iodide groups are hydrolyzed to hydroxyl groups.

3. Then, the hydroxyl groups are converted into good leaving groups (like sulfonates) in the next step.

4. Finally, heating causes elimination, forming rings or double bonds.

But I'm not exactly sure. Let me try to sketch a possible structure.

Assuming the first reaction is a Diels-Alder between the norbornene and the cyclohexadiene.

The norbornene (dienophile) would react with the cyclohexadiene (dien) in a Diels-Alder reaction. The product would be a bicyclic structure with substituents from the diene.

But considering two equivalents of the diene, perhaps two Diels-Alder adducts form, or perhaps the diene adds twice.

Alternatively, perhaps the norbornene reacts in a way that forms two new rings.

Wait, but I think I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the first reaction is adding iodide groups to the norbornene. But that doesn't seem likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the tert-butoxy group is replaced by something else.

Wait, perhaps the norbornene has a diene, which can undergo addition with the diene (cyclohexadiene) in a [4+4] cycloaddition, but that's not common.

Alternatively, perhaps the norbornene's double bond reacts with the cyclohexadiene in a way that forms a bridge.

But I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should think about the possible final structure.

The question is about the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4.

Assuming that product 4 is a highly symmetric molecule, perhaps with multiple identical substituents.

If the final product is a norbornene derivative with some substituents added in symmetric positions, the number of distinct hydrogens would depend on the symmetry.

For example, norbornene itself has 7 hydrogen atoms. If substituents are added symmetrically, the number of distinct hydrogens would be fewer.

But considering the steps, perhaps product 4 is a molecule with several identical groups, leading to fewer distinct hydrogens.

Wait, another approach: think about the possible formation of a cubane or a highly symmetric structure. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a tricyclic compound with several bridgehead substituents.

Wait, but without knowing the exact structures, it's hard to say. Maybe I should think of the options given.

The options are A)8, B)4, C)10, D)7.

I think the correct answer is likely D)7, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, considering the starting material's bicyclo structure, which already has some symmetry, adding substituents symmetrically would reduce the number of distinct hydrogens.

But wait, the starting material has a tert-butoxy group, which is bulky and possibly asymmetric. So, adding substituents around it could create more distinct hydrogens.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product has several equivalent protons due to symmetry.

Wait, another possibility: the final product is a norbornane (bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane) with several substituents. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, the number of distinct hydrogens would be fewer.

Norbornane has bridgehead hydrogens and other equivalent positions. For example, in norbornane, there are three types of hydrogens: bridgehead (two equivalent), and others.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product has a structure that leads to 8 distinct hydrogens. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, I'm stuck. I'll have to make a guess based on the options and the process.

Wait, let's think about the heating step. If product 3 is a sulfonated diol, heating could cause elimination, forming rings or double bonds. So, product 4 might be a more aromatic or conjugated structure, which could have fewer hydrogen atoms due to more symmetry.

But without the exact structures, it's really hard to tell. I'll have to go with my initial thought that the answer is D)7.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. The analysis of each step is as follows:

1. **First Reaction**: The starting material reacts with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide. This step likely involves substitution reactions where bromine atoms in the dibromomethyl groups are replaced by iodine atoms, forming product 1. The tert-butoxy group on the norbornene structure may remain intact.

2. **Second Reaction**: Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid, leading to product 2. This step could involve hydrolysis of the iodide groups formed in the first step, potentially converting them into hydroxyl groups or other functional groups.

3. **Third Reaction**: Product 2 is treated with SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO, forming product 3. This step likely introduces sulfonate groups or modifies existing functional groups, such as hydroxyl groups, into better leaving groups or sulfonated derivatives.

4. **Final Reaction**: Product 3 is heated at 150°C to form the final product 4. This step likely involves elimination or rearrangement, potentially forming a more conjugated or aromatic structure with increased symmetry.

The final product 4 is analyzed for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms. Considering the symmetry of the norbornene structure and the transformations described, the final product likely retains some symmetry, reducing the number of distinct hydrogen atoms. Based on the reasoning and the options provided, the most plausible answer is **7 distinct hydrogen atoms**.
