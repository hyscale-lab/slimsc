Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I remember that particles like mesons can have a certain mean lifetime, and from that, we can find how far they travel on average before decaying. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formulas. Let me think.

The question gives me the production energy E_X as 8 GeV, the mass m_X as 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X as 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters.

I think the mean lifetime τ is related to the width Γ. Oh right, the uncertainty principle! Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the lifetime by τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, since the units are in GeV and meters, I'll need to convert everything properly.

Wait, but actually, the decay width Γ is the total energy width of the resonance, and the mean lifetime is inversely proportional to Γ. So τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, I think the formula might have a factor involving c, the speed of light, and maybe the energy. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the mean proper lifetime, and then consider the particle's speed to find the lab frame decay distance.

Wait, but particles don't travel at the speed c in all cases. Their speed depends on their energy. So the mean decay distance L is given by L = v * τ, where v is the particle's velocity.

Hmm, so first I need to find the velocity of the meson X. To find the velocity, I should find the energy, mass, and then calculate the momentum. Then, using E² = (pc)² + (m c²)², I can find p, then v = pc/(E).

Alternatively, another approach: the velocity can be found using the relativistic expressions. Since E is given as 8 GeV, and the mass is 1.2 GeV, I can compute the gamma factor γ = E/(m c²). Wait, but wait, let's see the units.

Wait, E is in GeV, m is in GeV/c², because E = mc². So when E is given as 8 GeV, and mass is 1.2 GeV, perhaps the units would work out. Let me think: m c² is 1.2 GeV, E is 8 GeV. So gamma is E/(m c²) = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667. That's the Lorentz factor gamma.

Then, knowing gamma, I can find the velocity. Since gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so solving for v: v = c sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)). Let me compute that. Since gamma is about 6.6667, gamma squared is 44.444. So 1/gamma squared is about 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. Square root of that is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So v ≈ 0.9887 c.

So velocity is roughly 0.9887 times the speed of light. Now, I need to find the mean lifetime τ, which is ħ / Γ. Wait, but Γ is given in MeV, and ħ should be in units that make the division work. Let me think about the units.

Γ has units of energy (MeV), and ħ has units of GeV·s (or J·s if I go to SI units). Let me convert Γ into GeV. Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ. But what's the value of ħ in GeV·s? I remember that ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Wait, no, wait: 1 eV is 1.6e-19 joules. Let me check, Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s. So ħ = h/(2π) ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s. Converting to GeV·s: 1 J is 6.242e+18 eV, so 1 J·s is 6.242e+18 eV·s. So ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s * (6.242e+18 eV·s/J·s) )= 1.0545718e-34 * 6.242e18 eV·s. Wait, let me calculate that: 1e-34 * 1e18 is 1e-16. 1.05457 *6.242 is about 6.58, so 6.58e-16 eV·s. But wait, we need ħ in GeV·s. Since 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, so 6.58e-16 eV·s = 6.58e-25 GeV·s. So ħ ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So τ = ħ / Γ. Γ is 0.32 GeV. So tau is (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) )= (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s ≈ 20.56875e-25 s → 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check the Planck constant. Alternatively, perhaps I should remember that ħc is approximately 197.33 MeV·fm. Hmm, maybe that's another approach. Because sometimes decay lengths use ħc divided by the mass or something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the mean lifetime tau is hbar / (Gamma), where Gamma is in energy units. So in natural units where c=1, tau would have units of inverse energy. But since we're working in SI units, perhaps it's better to compute using the proper conversions.

Wait, let me recalculate ħ. So, 1 GeV = 1e9 eV. 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So 1 GeV = 1.602e-10 J. So ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So in GeV·s, that's (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1.602e-10 J/GeV) ) = 1.0545718e-34 / 1.602e-10 GeV·s ≈ 6.586e-25 GeV·s. Yeah, that's correct.

So tau = ħ / (Gamma) = 6.586e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV = (6.586e-25 / 0.32) s ≈ 2.058e-24 s.

Now, the mean decay distance L is v * tau. v is approximately 0.9887 c. So L = 0.9887 c * tau.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s. So putting it all together:

L = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.058e-24 s.

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 0.9887 *3e8 = approx 2.966e8 m/s.

Then, multiply by 2.058e-24 s:

2.966e8 * 2.058e-24 = (2.966 * 2.058) * 1e-16.

2.966 * 2.058 ≈ Let's compute 3 * 2 is 6, but more accurately:

2.966 * 2 ≈ 5.932.

2.966 * 0.058 ≈ 0.172.

So total is about 5.932 + 0.172 = 6.104.

So 6.104e-16 meters. Wait, but looking at the options, the options are in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16.

Wait, 6.104e-16 m is the same as 6.104 * 1e-16 m. The options have A) 5.0223e-16, D) 4.0655e-16, etc.

Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate.

Wait, let's compute 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s = 0.9887 * 3e8 = 2.9661e8 m/s.

Tau is 2.058e-24 s.

So L = 2.9661e8 m/s * 2.058e-24 s = (2.9661 * 2.058) * 1e-16.

Let's compute 2.9661 * 2.058.

2.9661 * 2 = 5.9322.

2.9661 * 0.058 = let's see: 2.9661 * 0.05 = 0.1483, and 2.9661 * 0.008 = 0.0237. So total 0.1483 + 0.0237 = 0.172.

So total is 5.9322 + 0.172 = 6.1042.

So 6.1042e-16 m.

But none of the options match this. Hmm, what did I do wrong?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the lifetime tau. Let me check the numbers again.

Gamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

Tau = ħ / Gamma = 6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV = (6.582 / 0.32 )e-25 s.

6.582 divided by 0.32: Let's compute that.

0.32 * 20 = 6.4. 6.582 - 6.4 = 0.182. So 0.182 / 0.32 = 0.56875.

So total is 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s. So that part was correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should be using the relativistic decay width. No, I think the formula I used is correct. Gamma is the total decay width, so tau is ħ / Gamma.

Wait another angle: the mean decay length is given by L = (c * tau) * beta, where beta is v/c. So perhaps I should have used beta * gamma something else? Let me think.

Wait, beta is v/c, which is about 0.9887. So L = beta c tau.

So let me compute beta c tau again.

Beta = 0.9887.

c tau = 3e8 m/s * 2.058e-24 s = 6.174e-16 m.

Multiply by beta: 6.174e-16 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.113e-16 m.

Hmm, still about 6e-16 m. But the options are:

A)5.0223e-16 m

B)4.0655e-15 m

C)5.0223e-15 m

D)4.0655e-16 m

Hmm, none of the options are near 6e-16. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the approach is wrong. Let me think differently. Maybe the mean decay distance is calculated using the proper lifetime, but multiplied by the velocity and the Lorentz gamma factor. Because the particle's lifetime is longer in the lab frame due to time dilation.

Wait, so the proper lifetime tau_0 is hbar / Gamma. But the lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau_0.

Wait no, because the decay width Gamma is the total width, which is the same in all frames because it's energy-dependent. Or is Gamma frame-dependent?

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the particle's lifetime in its rest frame. The decay width is Gamma = ħ / τ_0, where τ_0 is the proper lifetime. So τ_0 = ħ / Gamma.

Then, in the lab frame, the particle's lifetime is dilated: τ = gamma * τ_0.

So the mean lifetime observed is gamma * (hbar / Gamma).

Then, the mean distance is L = v * tau = v * gamma * tau_0.

Wait, but v is beta c, so L = beta c * gamma * tau_0.

But tau_0 is ħ / Gamma.

So putting it together, L = beta c gamma (ħ / Gamma).

Wait, beta gamma is equal to gamma (since beta = v/c, and gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2)).

Wait, let's compute gamma. Earlier, I found gamma to be E / (m c^2) = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.6667.

So now, beta gamma = (v/c) * gamma. Let's compute beta gamma.

Beta = v/c = 0.9887, so beta gamma = 0.9887 * 6.6667 ≈ 6.591.

So L = (beta gamma) * c * (ħ / Gamma).

Wait, let's compute this.

c is 3e8 m/s.

ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

So:

L = (6.591) * (3e8 m/s) * (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV).

Let me compute this step by step.

First, the GeV units cancel out.

So:

(6.591) * (3e8 m/s) * (6.582e-25 s) / 0.32.

Compute numerator: 6.591 * 3e8 = approx 1.9773e9.

1.9773e9 * 6.582e-25 = (1.9773 * 6.582) * 1e-16.

1.9773 *6.582 ≈ let's compute 2 *6.582 is 13.164, minus 0.0227 *6.582.

0.0227 *6.582 ≈ 0.1502. So 13.164 -0.1502=13.0138.

So 13.0138e-16.

Then divide by 0.32:

13.0138e-16 / 0.32 = approx 40.668e-16 m = 4.0668e-15 m.

Wait, that's 4.0668e-15 m. Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.02e-15.

Hmm, this is close to option B or C. Wait, but wait, I think I messed up the calculation somewhere.

Wait, let me recalculate the exact numbers.

Compute 6.591 * (3e8) = 6.591 *3 = 19.773 → 19.773e8 = 1.9773e9.

Multiply by 6.582e-25: 1.9773e9 *6.582e-25 = 1.9773 *6.582 = let me compute that accurately.

1.9773 *6 = 11.8638.

1.9773 *0.582 = let's compute:

1.9773 *0.5 = 0.98865

1.9773 *0.08 = 0.158184

1.9773 *0.002 = 0.0039546

Adding them: 0.98865 +0.158184=1.146834 +0.0039546=1.1507886.

So total is 11.8638 +1.1507886=13.0145886.

So 13.0145886e-16.

Divide by 0.32: 13.0145886 /0.32 = 40.6699643.

So 40.6699643e-16 m = 4.06699643e-15 m. So about 4.067e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m. So that's very close. So the correct answer would be option B.

But wait, why did I get a different answer earlier? Because in the first approach, I didn't factor in the gamma correctly. Oh, right! Because the mean lifetime is gamma times the proper lifetime, not just the proper lifetime. So the initial approach didn't account for time dilation, which is a big factor here. So the correct process is to calculate using the relativistic gamma.

So the correct calculation leads me to option B with 4.0655e-15 m.

To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the relativistic formula for the mean decay distance:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau_0
\]

where:
- \( \beta = \frac{v}{c} \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( c \) is the speed of light,
- \( \tau_0 = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \) is the proper lifetime of the particle in its rest frame,
- \( \Gamma \) is the total decay width.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The energy \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and the mass \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \). The Lorentz factor is:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \beta \)
The relationship between \( \beta \) and \( \gamma \) is:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} \approx \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \tau_0 \)
The proper lifetime \( \tau_0 \) is given by:

\[
\tau_0 = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

The reduced Planck constant \( \hbar \) is approximately \( 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s} \), and the decay width \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). Thus:

\[
\tau_0 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.0569 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( \beta \gamma \)
The product \( \beta \gamma \) is:

\[
\beta \gamma = 0.9887 \times 6.6667 \approx 6.591
\]

### Step 5: Calculate \( L \)
The mean decay distance is:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau_0
\]

Substituting \( \beta \gamma = 6.591 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau_0 = 2.0569 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \):

\[
L = 6.591 \times (3 \times 10^8) \times (2.0569 \times 10^{-24})
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
6.591 \times 3 \times 10^8 = 1.9773 \times 10^9
\]

\[
1.9773 \times 10^9 \times 2.0569 \times 10^{-24} = 4.066 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

Thus, the mean decay distance is approximately:

\[
L \approx 4.066 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 6: Match with options
The closest option is:

**B) \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)**

### Final Answer:
**Answer: B**
