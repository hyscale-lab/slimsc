Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The given information is that there's a 0.02 M solution of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They also mention that the pH is ideal and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like Ca²+ pretty tightly. The formation constant, K, is a measure of how strong that binding is. A high K like 5e10 means the complex is very stable, so most of the EDTA and Ca²+ would be tied up in the complex.

Wait, the problem says it's a stoichiometric solution. So that means the molar ratio of Ca²+ to EDTA is 1:1. Because EDTA is usually a hexadentate ligand, so each Ca²+ would bind one EDTA molecule. So the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. That suggests that the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA are each 0.02 M before any complexation. But wait, no, because when they form the complex, the free Ca²+ and free EDTA concentrations will change. Or maybe it's given that the complex is at 0.02 M, so we can model the dissociation of the complex.

Wait, no. The problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So all the Ca²+ and EDTA has formed the complex, right? Because the stoichiometry is 1:1. So the concentration of the complex [CaY²−] is 0.02 M. But once in solution, the complex can dissociate a bit. So the free Ca²+ concentration is what we need to find.

So the formation constant K is given. I think the formation constant expression is K = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA]). But wait, in the solution, the EDTA is present as Y^4- (the deprotonated form), right? Since pH is ideal, which I think implies that the pH is such that EDTA is mostly in its Y^4- form, so we don't have to worry about the protonation states affecting the calculation.

So the K expression is K = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y^4-]).

But wait, since the solution is stoichiometric, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, but some of it dissociates into Ca²+ and Y^4-. Let's denote the degree of dissociation as α. So [Ca²+] = α * 0.02, and [Y^4-] = α * 0.02. Wait, but that would mean [Ca²+] = [Y^4-]. Hmm, but what about the initial concentrations? Let me think again.

Wait, the initial concentrations before dissociation: the complex is 0.02 M, and the free Ca²+ and EDTA (Y^4-) are zero? No, that's not right because in reality, the complex would dissociate a little. So maybe the initial concentrations are not zero but the complex is 0.02, and the dissociation starts from there.

Wait, I think the setup is that the complex is 0.02 M, and dissociates into Ca²+ and Y^4- as:

CaY²− ↔ Ca²+ + Y^4− 

So, the initial concentration of CaY²− is 0.02 M. Then, at equilibrium, let x be the concentration of Ca²+ and Y^4− formed. So:

[CaY²−] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is very small compared to 0.02, because K is very large, so the dissociation is minimal).

Wait, but if K is 5e10, which is a huge number, that implies that the complex is very stable. So the dissociation is minimal, which means x is really small. Therefore, we can approximate [CaY²−] ≈ 0.02.

So the equilibrium expression would be K = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y^4−]) = (0.02)/(x^2) = 5e10.

Solving for x:

(0.02)/(x²) = 5e10 ⇒ x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-12 / 5e10? Wait, wait.

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13. Then x² = 4e-13 ⇒ x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5?

Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 is 4 *1e-13. Square root is sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5. So yes, 2e-6.5 is approximately 6.32e-7. Because 1e-6 is 1e-6, and 1e-7 is 0.1e-6. So 6.32e-7 is about 6.3e-7, which is option C.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me recalculate. Because K is 5e10, which is a big number, so the reaction is product-favored, meaning x is very small, so our approximation holds.

So, K = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y^4−]) = 5e10.

Given that [CaY²−]≈0.02, so:

5e10 = 0.02/(x^2).

x² = 0.02/(5e10) = 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 =0.4e-12=4e-13? Wait, 2e-2 is 0.02. 0.02 divided by 5e10 is (0.02)/(5e10) = (2e-2)/(5e10) )= 2/(5e12) )= 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x² =4e-13 → x= sqrt(4e-13)=2e-6.5.

Wait, 2e-6.5 is 2 * 1e-6.5. 1e-6 is 1e-6, 1e-7 is 0.1e-6. 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7 because 6.5 is halfway between 6 and 7. So 1e-6.5 ≈ 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is about 6.32e-7.

Which is about 6.3e-7, matching option C.

So the concentration of Ca²+ is 6.3e-7 M.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the equilibrium expression for the dissociation of the complex:

\[
\text{CaY}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{Y}^{4-}
\]

The formation constant is given as \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \), and the initial concentration of the complex \([ \text{CaY}^{2-} ]\) is 0.02 M. Let \( x \) represent the concentration of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{Y}^{4-}\) formed at equilibrium. Since the dissociation is minimal due to the large \( K \), we approximate:

\[
[\text{CaY}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x, \quad [\text{Y}^{4-}] = x
\]

Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{Y}^{4-}]} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2} \implies x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions in the solution is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The given information is that there's a 0.02 M solution of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex.

Wait, no. The problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So all the Ca²+ and EDTA has formed the complex, right? Because the stoichiometry is 1:1. So the concentration of the complex [CaY²−] is 0.02 M. But once in solution, the complex can dissociate a bit. So the free Ca²+ concentration is what we need to find.

So the formation constant K is given. I think the formation constant expression is K = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA]). But wait, in the solution, the EDTA is present as Y^4- (the deprotonated form), right? Since pH is ideal, which I think implies that the pH is such that EDTA is mostly in its Y^4- form, so we don't have to worry about the protonation states affecting the calculation.

So the K expression is K = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y^4-]).

But wait, since the solution is stoichiometric, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, but some of it dissociates into Ca²+ and Y^4-. Let's denote the degree of dissociation as α. So [Ca²+] = α * 0.02, and [Y^4-] = α * 0.02. Wait, but that would mean [Ca²+] = [Y^4-]. Hmm, but what about the initial concentrations? Let me think again.

Wait, the initial concentrations before dissociation: the complex is 0.02 M, and the free Ca²+ and EDTA (Y^4-) are zero? No, that's not right because in reality, the complex would dissociate a little. So maybe the initial concentrations are not zero but the complex is 0.02, and the dissociation starts from there.

Wait, I think the setup is that the complex is 0.02 M, and dissociates into Ca²+ and Y^4- as:

CaY²− ↔ Ca²+ + Y^4− 

So, the initial concentration of CaY²− is 0.02 M. Then, at equilibrium, let x be the concentration of Ca²+ and Y^4− formed. So:

[CaY²−] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is very small compared to 0.02, because K is very large, so the dissociation is minimal).

Wait, but if K is 5e10, which is a huge number, that implies that the complex is very stable. So the dissociation is minimal, which means x is really small. Therefore, we can approximate [CaY²−] ≈ 0.02.

So the equilibrium expression would be K = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y^4−]) = (0.02)/(x^2) = 5e10.

Solving for x:

(0.02)/(x²) = 5e10 ⇒ x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-12 / 5e10? Wait, wait.

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13. Then x² = 4e-13 ⇒ x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5?

Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 is 4 *1e-13. Square root is sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5. So yes, 2e-6.5 is approximately 6.32e-7. Because 1e-6 is 1e-6, and 1e-7 is 0.1e-6. So 6.32e-7 is about 6.3e-7, which is option C.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me recalculate. Because K is 5e10, which is a big number, so the reaction is product-favored, meaning x is very small, so our approximation holds.

So, K = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y^4−]) = 5e10.

Given that [CaY²−]≈0.02, so:

5e10 = 0.02/(x^2).

x² = 0.02/(5e10) = 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 =0.4e-12=4e-13? Wait, 2e-2 is 0.02. 0.02 divided by 5e10 is (0.02)/(5e10) = (2e-2)/(5e10) )= 2/(5e12) )= 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x² =4e-13 → x= sqrt(4e-13)=2e-6.5.

Wait, 2e-6.5 is 2 * 1e-6.5. 1e-6 is 1e-6, 1e-7 is 0.1e-6. 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7 because 6.5 is halfway between 6 and 7. So 1e-6.5 ≈ 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is about 6.32e-7.

Which is about 6.3e-7, matching option C.

So the concentration of Ca²+ is 6.3e-7 M.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the equilibrium expression for the dissociation of the complex:

\[
\text{CaY}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{Y}^{4-}
\]

The formation constant is given as \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \), and the initial concentration of the complex \([ \text{CaY}^{2-} ]\) is 0.02 M. Let \( x \) represent the concentration of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{Y}^{4-}\) formed at equilibrium. Since the dissociation is minimal due to the large \( K \), we approximate:

\[
[\text{CaY}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x, \quad [\text{Y}^{4-}] = x
\]

Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{Y}^{4-}]} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2} \implies x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions in the solution is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
