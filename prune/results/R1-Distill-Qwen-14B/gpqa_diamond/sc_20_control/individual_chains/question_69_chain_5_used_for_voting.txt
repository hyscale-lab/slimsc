Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's see.

The problem says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻, and the proper lifetime τ₀ is 8e-16 seconds. I need to find the minimum resolution needed so that at least 30% of the decays are observed. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. The options are A to D, with various resolutions.

Wait, so first, the proper lifetime τ₀ is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when the particle is moving, its lifetime from our (lab) frame perspective would be longer due to time dilation. Oh right, time dilation formula is τ = γτ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor, γ = total energy / (m c²), but since we're working in units where c=1, it's just γ = E/m.

Wait, the energy given is 27 GeV. Oh, but wait, the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. So the energy E of the particle is 27 GeV. So γ would be E/m = 27 / 3.41. Let me calculate that. 27 divided by 3.41... let's see, 3.41 * 7 is 23.87, 3.41*8 is about 27.28. So 27 is a bit less than 8 times 3.41. So approximately 7.91? Let me get more precise.

3.41 * 7.9 = 3.41 * (8-0.1) = 27.28 - 0.341 = 26.939. So 7.9 gives around 26.939 GeV. We have 27 GeV, so maybe around 7.93 or so. Let's compute it accurately.

Wait, 3.41 * 7.9 = 26.939 GeV. 27 is 0.061 GeV higher. Each additional 0.01 in γ would add 3.41 * 0.01 = 0.0341 GeV. So 0.061 / 0.0341 ≈ 1.79, so 0.0179 increase in γ. So γ ≈7.9 + 0.0179 ≈7.9179. So approximately 7.92. So γ is about 7.92.

So the lifetime τ = γ τ₀. τ₀ is 8e-16 s. So τ=7.92 *8e-16 s. Let me calculate that. 7.92 *8 = 63.36. So τ=63.36e-16 s =6.336e-15 s.

Wait, but wait, no. 7.92 multiplied by 8 is actually 63.36, so yeah, 6.336e-15 s is correct.

Now, the lifetime is the time the particle exists in the lab frame. So the distance it travels before decaying is L = v * τ. But wait, what's the velocity v? Since the energy is 27 GeV, and the mass is 3.41 GeV, the kinetic energy is high, so the particle is moving at a speed close to c.

Alternatively, since the energy E is given as 27 GeV, and the mass m is 3.41 GeV, the total energy is E = γ m c², but in units where c=1, E=γ m. So, gamma is 27/3.41 ≈7.92, as before.

The velocity v can be found from beta, where beta = v/c. And beta is given by beta = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)). Wait, no, wait: beta = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E² c^4)) ), but since c=1, it's sqrt(1 - (m²)/(E²)).

So m is 3.41 GeV, E is 27 GeV. So m² is about 11.63, E² is 729. So (m/E)^2 = (3.41/27)^2 ≈ (0.1263)^2 ≈ 0.01595. So 1 - 0.01595=0.98405. So beta is sqrt(0.98405) ≈ 0.99198, so about 0.992 c. So v ≈0.992c.

So now, the distance L the particle travels is v * τ. Let's compute that.

v is 0.992c, c is 3e8 meters per second. So v = 0.992 *3e8 = 2.976e8 m/s.

τ is 6.336e-15 s. So L = 2.976e8 m/s * 6.336e-15 s = let's compute that.

Multiply 2.976e8 by 6.336e-15. 2.976 *6.336 ≈ let's see, 3 *6=18, but precise calculation:

2.976 *6.336: 2 *6.336 =12.672, 0.976 *6.336≈6.180. So total is around 12.672 +6.180=18.852. So 18.852e(8-15) = 18.852e-7 meters. 1e-7 m is 100 nm, but so 18.852e-7 m is 1.885e-6 m? Wait, wait, 18.852e-7 is 1.8852e-6 m. Yes.

So L≈1.885e-6 meters.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Oh right, I think that refers to the minimum uncertainty in the decay length measurement, such that we can see whether the decay happened or not. Wait, no, perhaps it's about the minimum resolution (like the detector's resolution) such that 30% of the decays are detected.

Wait no, perhaps it's the minimum uncertainty in the measurement (the resolution) that allows observing at least 30% of the decays. So perhaps the decay length is the proper distance the particle travels before decaying, and the resolution is the smallest length that the detector can distinguish. So if the decay length is L, then the detector must have a resolution (ΔL) such that ΔL is less than a certain fraction of L to detect a significant number of decays.

Wait, another approach: The decay length is L=βγ c τ₀. So we found L≈1.885e-6 m, which is about 1.885 micrometers. But wait, the options are in the order of 1e-9 m (nanometers), 1e-6 (micrometers), 1e-3 (mm), etc.

But the question asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Hmm, perhaps this relates to the uncertainty in the decay position. If the detector's spatial resolution (the minimum distance it can resolve) is too poor, it might not be able to detect the decay accurately.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think in terms of the decay probability. The proper lifetime is τ₀, but the observed lifetime is longer due to time dilation. The decay length is L = βγ c τ₀. And the number of decays observed depends on whether the decay occurs within the detector's volume or not.

Wait, but the problem states that we need to observe at least 30% of the decays. So perhaps the detector's resolution must be such that the length L is sufficiently large that a certain fraction of the decays are detected. Alternatively, maybe the problem is about the decay length and the minimum distance that the particle travels before decaying, so that the detector can observe the decay products.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The proper approach is probably to calculate the decay length L, and then determine the minimum resolution (like the detector's precision ΔL) needed to observe a certain fraction of the decays. But I'm not exactly sure how to connect the 30% part to the resolution.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the minimum distance (L_min) that the particle must travel so that a certain fraction (30%) of the particles decay within that distance. But that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the mean decay length L, and then the minimum resolution (ΔL) required such that the probability of the decay being observed (i.e., the decay occurring within a region that the detector can distinguish) is at least 30%. But I'm not exactly sure how to model that.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is more straightforward: the resolution required is the decay length itself. Because if the decay occurs, the particles will travel L, and to "observe" the decay, you need to measure that L. But if the detector's resolution (the smallest distance it can measure) is higher than L, then you can't see it. So the minimum resolution needed is the decay length, such that the detector can resolve it.

Wait, that makes sense. So the decay length L is the minimum resolution needed to observe the decay. So if the detector's resolution is less than L, it can detect the decay. So the minimum resolution required is the decay length.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the resolution refers to the position measurement. So, if the decay occurs at a point, and the detector has a resolution Δx, then the probability of observing the decay is the probability that the decay occurs within a region that the detector can resolve. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the decay length, which is the minimum distance that the particle travels before decaying, so that the detector can see the decay products. If the detector has a resolution (spatial resolution) higher than this length, then it can observe the decay.

So if the decay length is 1.885e-6 m (about 1.885 micrometers), then the detector's resolution must be at least that to observe the decay. But looking at the options, option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is about 2 micrometers. That's close to what I calculated.

But wait, let me recalculate L more accurately.

We had E = 27 GeV, m=3.41 GeV.

Gamma = E/m = 27 /3.41 = let me compute this more accurately.

3.41 *7 =23.87, 3.41*7.9=26.939, as before. 27 -26.939=0.061. So 0.061 /3.41 per unit gamma. So 0.061/3.41 is approximately 0.0179. So gamma is 7.9 + 0.0179 =7.9179.

So gamma is approximately 7.918.

Now, beta is sqrt(1 - (m²/E²)) = sqrt(1 - (3.41^2 / 27^2)).

Compute m²= 11.6281 GeV², E²=729 GeV².

m²/E²= 11.6281/729 ≈ 0.01595.

So 1 -0.01595=0.98405.

Beta= sqrt(0.98405)= approximately 0.99198.

So beta is about 0.992.

So L=beta * gamma * c * tau_0.

Tau_0 is 8e-16 s.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So L= 0.992 *7.918 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Let's compute each part step by step.

0.992 *7.918 = approx 7.868 (since 0.992 *8=7.936, subtract 0.992*(8-7.918)=0.992*0.082 ≈0.081, so 7.936-0.081=7.855. Hmm, maybe I should calculate it more accurately.

Wait, 7.918 *0.992:

Compute 7.918 * (1 -0.008) = 7.918 - (7.918 *0.008).

7.918 *0.008=0.063344.

So 7.918 -0.063344=7.854656.

So beta * gamma ≈7.8546.

Now, L= 7.8546 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Multiply 3e8 *8e-16 =24e-8 =2.4e-7 meters.

Now, 7.8546 *2.4e-7 = let's calculate.

7 * 2.4e-7 =1.68e-6.

0.8546 *2.4e-7 = approx 2.051e-7.

So total is 1.68e-6 + 2.051e-7 = 1.8851e-6 m.

So L=1.885e-6 meters. That's about 1.885 micrometers.

Looking at the options, option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is 2.08 micrometers. So option A is close but a bit higher than our calculation.

Wait, but perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents. Let's compute 3e8 *8e-16.

3e8 is 3 *1e8, 8e-16 is 8 *1e-16.

Multiply them: 3*8=24; exponents 1e8 *1e-16 =1e-8. So 24e-8=2.4e-7.

Yes, so 7.8546 *2.4e-7 = let me compute this accurately.

7.8546 *2.4 = let's compute 7 *2.4=16.8; 0.8546*2.4=2.05104. So total 18.85104. So 18.85104e-7 m =1.885104e-6 m.

So L≈1.885e-6 m.

But the options don't have exactly this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation or in beta.

Wait, perhaps I should redo the gamma calculation more accurately.

Gamma is E/m =27 /3.41.

Let me compute 27 /3.41 exactly.

3.41 *7 =23.87.

27-23.87=3.13.

Now, 3.41 * 0.916 (since 7.916*3.41=27) ?

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 27 /3.41.

3.41 *7 =23.87.

Left with 3.13.

3.13 /3.41 = 0.9176. So gamma is 7.9176.

So gamma is approximately 7.9176.

Beta: sqrt(1 - (m^2/E^2)).

m=3.41, E=27.

m²=3.41^2 =11.6281.

E²=27^2=729.

11.6281/729=0.01595 approximately.

So 1 -0.01595=0.98405.

sqrt(0.98405)= let me compute more accurately.

Since 0.99^2=0.9801; 0.992^2= (0.99 +0.002)^2= 0.99^2 + 2*0.99 *0.002 +0.002^2=0.9801 +0.00396 +0.000004=0.984064.

Oh, wait! That's close to our value of 0.98405.

Because 0.992^2=0.984064, which is just a bit higher than 0.98405, which is our value. So sqrt(0.98405) is just a tiny bit less than 0.992. Let's see: 0.992^2=0.984064.

Our value is 0.98405, which is 0.000014 less than 0.984064. So it's 0.992 - delta, where delta is small.

So beta ≈ 0.992 - (0.000014)/(2*0.992).

Which is approximately 0.992 - (0.000014)/(1.984) ≈0.992 - 0.00000705 ≈0.991993.

So beta is approximately 0.991993.

So beta * gamma is 0.991993 *7.9176.

Compute 0.991993 *7.9176.

Let me compute:

7.9176 *0.991993.

Approximate:

7.9176 *0.99 = 7.8484.

7.9176 *0.001993= approx 0.01578.

Total ≈7.8484 +0.01578=7.8642.

Wait, but perhaps a better way is to compute 7.9176*(1 -0.008007) =7.9176 -7.9176*0.008007.

7.9176 *0.008007= approx 0.06343.

So 7.9176 -0.06343=7.85417.

So beta * gamma ≈7.85417.

Now, back to L= beta gamma c tau_0.

c is 3e8 m/s.

tau_0=8e-16 s.

So L=7.85417 *3e8 *8e-16.

Compute 3e8 *8e-16 =24e-8=2.4e-7 m.

Multiply by 7.85417: 7.85417 *2.4e-7.

7 *2.4=16.8, 0.85417 *2.4=2.050008.

So 16.8e-7 +2.05e-7 =18.85e-7 m=1.885e-6 m.

So L≈1.885e-6 meters, which is 1.885 micrometers.

Looking at the options again:

A) 2.08e-6 m (2.08 micrometers)
B) 2.08e-9 m (2.08 nm)
C) 2.08e-1 m (20.8 cm)
D) 2.08e-3 m (2.08 mm)

Hmm, option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is about 0.1 micrometers higher than our calculated 1.885e-6 m. So why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check if the initial formula is correct.

The decay length L is given by L = beta * gamma * c * tau_0.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the energy used is wrong? The problem states the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV. So E =27 GeV is the total energy of the X⁰ particle. So yes, gamma is 27/3.41 ≈7.9176.

Wait, but maybe I should use relativistic equations differently.

Another approach: The lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau_0.

So the time the particle exists is t=gamma tau_0.

The speed is v= beta c.

So distance L= v t = beta c gamma tau_0.

Yes, which is the same as before.

So L= beta gamma c tau_0.

So the calculation seems correct.

So why is the option A 2.08e-6 m, which is about 15% higher than our calculation?

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in beta*gamma.

Wait, let's compute beta gamma more accurately.

gamma=27/3.41= let's compute it with more precision.

3.41 *7.9176=?

Wait, 3.41 *7=23.87.

3.41 *0.9176= let's compute that.

0.9 *3.41=3.069.

0.0176 *3.41=0.059936.

So 3.069 +0.059936=3.128936.

So 3.41 *7.9176=23.87+3.128936=26.998936 ≈27. So yes, gamma=7.9176.

Beta= sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2))=sqrt(1 - (3.41^2)/(27^2)).

3.41^2=11.6281.

27^2=729.

11.6281/729=0.01595.

So 1-0.01595=0.98405.

sqrt(0.98405)= approximately 0.991993.

So beta=0.991993.

So beta * gamma=0.991993 *7.9176.

Compute this more accurately.

0.991993 *7 =6.943951.

0.991993 *0.9176= let's compute:

0.991993 *0.9=0.8927937.

0.991993 *0.0176=0.0174711.

So total 0.9102648.

So total beta gamma=6.943951 +0.9102648=7.8542158.

So beta gamma ≈7.8542.

So L=beta gamma c tau_0=7.8542 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Compute 3e8 *8e-16=24e-8=2.4e-7 m.

Multiply by 7.8542: 7.8542 * 2.4e-7.

Compute 7 *2.4=16.8, 0.8542 *2.4=2.05008.

Total 18.85008e-7 m =1.885008e-6 m.

So approximately 1.885 micrometers.

The options have option A as 2.08e-6 m. Which is about 2.08 micrometers. So why is there a difference?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta gamma. Alternatively, perhaps the mass is in MeV? No, the problem states mass is 3.41 GeV, so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the proper lifetime is given in seconds, but I used it correctly.

Wait, the proper lifetime is 8e-16 seconds. Yes.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the average decay length, and the minimum resolution is the decay length. So the correct answer would be the decay length. So the answer would be approximately 1.885e-6 m, but none of the options match exactly.

Hmm, the options are:

A)2.08e-6 m

B)2.08e-9 m

C)2.08e-1 m

D)2.08e-3 m.

Wait, 2.08e-6 is 2.08 micrometers. Our calculation is 1.885e-6 m. So perhaps the correct option is A, but why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated beta*gamma.

Wait, perhaps the error comes from the approximation of beta as 0.992. Let me compute beta more accurately.

We have beta = sqrt(1- (m²)/(E²)).

Compute 1- m²/E²=1 - (3.41^2)/(27^2) =1 - (11.6281)/(729) =1 - 0.015954 ≈0.984046.

Beta = sqrt(0.984046) = ?

Let me compute sqrt(0.984046) accurately.

We know that 0.992^2=0.984064.

Our value is 0.984046, which is 0.000018 less than 0.984064. So beta is slightly less than 0.992.

The difference in beta between 0.992 and a bit lower.

Let me use linear approximation. Let x=0.992, f(x)=x².

We have f(x)=0.984064.

We need f(x-delta)=0.984046.

df= -2 x delta ≈0.984064 -0.984046=0.000018.

So delta≈0.000018/(2 *0.992)=0.00000909.

So beta=0.992 -0.00000909≈0.99199091.

So beta is approximately 0.99199091.

So beta*gamma=0.99199091 *7.9176.

Compute accurately:

7.9176 *0.99199091.

Let me compute 7.9176 *0.99199091.

Break it down: 7.9176 * (1 - 0.00800909) =7.9176 - (7.9176 *0.00800909).

Compute 7.9176 *0.00800909.

0.008 *7.9176=0.0633408.

0.00000909 *7.9176≈0.0000720.

So total is approximately 0.0633408 +0.0000720=0.0634128.

So beta*gamma=7.9176 -0.0634128=7.8541872.

So L= 7.8541872 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

3e8 *8e-16=24e-8=2.4e-7 m.

Multiply by 7.8541872: 7.8541872 *2.4e-7.

7 *2.4=16.8e-7.

0.8541872 *2.4e-7= let me compute 0.8541872 *2.4=2.05005.

So total is 16.8e-7 +2.05005e-7=18.85005e-7=1.885005e-6 m.

So L=1.885e-6 m.

Hmm, but the closest option is A, which is 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me check the beta and gamma again.

Alternatively, maybe the initial formula is wrong. Wait, another approach: the mean path length (decay length) is L=gamma * v * tau_0.

Wait, but v=beta c, so L=gamma beta c tau_0.

Which is the same as before.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is about the minimum detectable length being such that the probability of the decay being observed is 30%. So the decay length is L, and the resolution is the minimum uncertainty (ΔL) such that the probability (P) that the decay occurs within ΔL is at least 30%.

Wait, but that seems more complicated. The decay follows an exponential distribution, so the probability that the decay occurs after time t is P(t) = exp(-t/(gamma tau_0)).

Wait, no, the particle decays with probability proportional to the time. The average decay length is gamma beta c tau_0, but the decay length distribution is exponential.

Wait, the decay length probability is P(L) = (1/L_avg) exp(-L / L_avg), where L_avg is the average decay length (gamma beta c tau_0).

So to find the minimum ΔL such that the probability of the decay occurring within a distance ΔL is ≥30%, we can integrate P(L) from 0 to ΔL and set it equal to 0.3.

The integral of P(L) dL from 0 to x is 1 - exp(-x/L_avg).

So 1 - exp(-x/L_avg) ≥0.3 → exp(-x/L_avg) ≤0.7 → -x/L_avg ≤ ln(0.7) → x ≥ - L_avg ln(0.7).

ln(0.7) is approximately -0.35667.

So x ≥ L_avg * 0.35667.

So the minimum ΔL needed is 0.35667 * L_avg.

Wait, so if L_avg is 1.885e-6 m, then ΔL >= 1.885e-6 *0.35667 ≈ approx 0.67e-6 m.

But that's about 0.67 micrometers, which is less than option A's 2.08 micrometers. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. The question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So perhaps the decay length must be larger than the resolution for 30% of the cases. Hmm, but I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the decay length as L=gamma c tau_0, ignoring beta. But that would be incorrect, as beta is part of the formula.

Wait, let me compute L without considering beta. L=gamma c tau_0.

Gamma=7.9176, c=3e8 m/s, tau0=8e-16 s.

So L=7.9176 *3e8 *8e-16.

3e8 *8e-16=24e-8=2.4e-7 m.

Multiply by 7.9176: 7.9176 *2.4e-7 =19.002e-7=1.9002e-6 m.

Which is about 1.9e-6 m. Option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is close to this.

Wait, but beta is 0.992, so including it, the L is about 1.885e-6 m. So perhaps the question expects us to ignore beta, and just use gamma c tau_0. Then L would be about 1.9e-6 m, which is close to option A.

So perhaps that's the approach the question wants. But that would be an incorrect approach because L should include beta as well. So why is this discrepancy?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum path length that the particle travels, which is the average decay length, and the minimum resolution is 30% of that.

Wait, the question says "minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays." Hmm, perhaps that refers to the fraction of the decay length that must be resolved to detect the decay. So perhaps the detector must be able to resolve a distance of at least 30% of the average decay length.

So 30% of 1.885e-6 m is 0.5655e-6 m. But none of the options match that.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution such that 30% of the decays are detected, which would relate to the detector's ability to measure the decay length. If the detector's resolution is less than the decay length, it can't resolve the decay. So the minimum resolution would be the decay length itself. Because if the resolution is lower than the decay length, you can see the decay.

Wait, but that doesn't directly tie into the 30% part. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the minimum resolution to be 30% of the decay length. So 0.3 * L.

Wait, but that would give 0.565e-6 m, which is 0.565 micrometers, which isn't any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum uncertainty in the decay length measurement such that 30% of the decays are observed. But I'm not sure how to model that.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The answer seems to be option A, 2.08e-6 m, which is 2.08 micrometers. Our calculated decay length is about 1.885 micrometers, but perhaps the options have a rounding factor. Maybe the question expects the answer to be option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, and the correct L is 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, let me compute gamma again.

27 GeV / 3.41 GeV = 7.9176.

Beta: sqrt(1 - (3.41/27)^2) = sqrt(1 - (0.1263)^2) = sqrt(1 -0.01595) = sqrt(0.98405)= approx 0.99199.

So beta * gamma =7.9176 * 0.99199 ≈7.854.

So L=7.854 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s =7.854 *2.4e-7 m =18.8496e-7 m=1.88496e-6 m.

So this is about 1.885 micrometers.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps it's option A, which is 2.08e-6 m.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial calculation is correct and the answer is option A. Alternatively, perhaps the correct calculation is to compute gamma as E/(m c²), but since we're using units where c=1, it's just E/m.

Wait, perhaps the energy is kinetic energy, not the total energy. Hmm, that's a possibility. Let me check the question again.

The question states: "the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV." It doesn't specify whether it's total energy or kinetic energy. If it's kinetic energy, then the total energy is K + m c² =27 GeV +3.41 GeV=30.41 GeV.

So gamma would be E/m =30.41 /3.41≈8.90.

Wait, that would change things.

So if E is kinetic energy, then total energy is E_kinetic + m c².

So E=27 GeV is kinetic energy, so total energy E_total =27 +3.41=30.41 GeV.

Gamma=E_total/m=30.41/3.41= approx 8.90.

Then beta would be sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E_total^2)).

Compute m^2=11.6281, E_total²= (30.41)^2= approx 924. So 11.6281/924≈0.01258.

1-0.01258=0.98742.

sqrt(0.98742)=approx 0.9937.

So beta=0.9937.

Then L= beta gamma c tau_0.

Compute beta gamma=0.9937 *8.90≈8.83.

So L=8.83 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

3e8 *8e-16=24e-8=2.4e-7 m.

8.83 *2.4e-7=21.192e-7=2.1192e-6 m.

So L≈2.12e-6 m.

Which is close to option A's 2.08e-6 m.

Ah, this makes sense now. So perhaps the initial assumption was wrong, and the energy given is the kinetic energy, not the total energy.

So the correct approach would be:

If E is kinetic energy, then E_total = E_kin + m c² =27 +3.41=30.41 GeV.

Gamma=E_total/m=30.41/3.41≈8.90.

Beta= sqrt(1 - (m²/E_total²))=sqrt(1 - (3.41/30.41)^2).

Compute (3.41/30.41)^2≈(0.11217)^2≈0.01258.

So 1-0.01258=0.98742.

sqrt(0.98742)= approx 0.9937.

So beta=0.9937.

So beta gamma=0.9937 *8.90≈8.83.

So L=8.83 *3e8 *8e-16.

Compute 3e8 *8e-16=2.4e-7 m.

8.83 *2.4e-7=21.192e-7=2.1192e-6 m≈2.12e-6 m.

Which is approximately 2.08e-6 m, matching option A.

So the correct answer would be option A.

But wait, the problem states that the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV. Typically, when physicists refer to the energy of a particle in an accelerator, it's the kinetic energy if the mass is much smaller than the energy. But in this case, the mass is 3.41 GeV, and 27 GeV is the energy. So perhaps the energy refers to the kinetic energy.

Ah, that's probably where the confusion was. So in this problem, the energy is the kinetic energy, not the total energy. So the calculation gives us L≈2.12e-6 m, which is closest to option A (2.08e-6 m).

So the answer should be option A.

To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle \( X^0 \) in the CERN Bubble Chamber, we calculate the decay length \( L \) that the particle travels before decaying. The decay length is given by:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau_0
\]

where:
- \( \tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \) is the proper lifetime of \( X^0 \),
- \( \beta = v/c \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m} \) is the Lorentz factor, with \( E = 27 \, \text{GeV} \) (total energy) and \( m = 3.41 \, \text{GeV} \) (mass of \( X^0 \)),
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor is:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{27}{3.41} \approx 7.92
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \beta \)
The velocity \( \beta \) is determined using the relativistic relation:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{m^2}{E^2}}
\]

Substituting \( m = 3.41 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( E = 27 \, \text{GeV} \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{(3.41)^2}{(27)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{11.6281}{729}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.01595} = \sqrt{0.98405} \approx 0.992
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \beta \gamma \)
The product \( \beta \gamma \) is:

\[
\beta \gamma = 0.992 \times 7.92 \approx 7.85
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the decay length \( L \)
The decay length is:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau_0
\]

Substituting \( \beta \gamma = 7.85 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \):

\[
L = 7.85 \times (3 \times 10^8) \times (8 \times 10^{-16}) = 7.85 \times 2.4 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \approx 1.885 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}
\]

Thus, the decay length is approximately \( 1.885 \, \mu\text{m} \).

### Step 5: Interpret the question and match with options
The problem asks for the **minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays**. This implies that the detector's resolution must be sufficient to resolve the decay length \( L \). Among the given options, the closest value to the calculated decay length is:

\[
\text{Option A: } 2.08 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}
\]

This slight discrepancy could arise from rounding or approximations in the problem setup.

### Final Answer:
\[
\text{Answer: A}
\]

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's see.

The problem says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻, and the proper lifetime τ₀ is 8e-16 seconds. I need to find the minimum resolution needed so that at least 30% of the decays are observed. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. The options are A to D, with various resolutions.

Wait, so first, the proper lifetime τ₀ is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when the particle is moving, its lifetime from our (lab) frame perspective would be longer due to time dilation. Oh right, time dilation formula is τ = γτ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor, γ = total energy / (m c²), but since we're working in units where c=1, it's just γ = E/m.

Wait, the energy given is 27 GeV. Oh, but wait, the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. So the energy E of the particle is 27 GeV. So γ would be E/m = 27 / 3.41. Let me calculate that. 27 divided by 3.41... let's see, 3.41 * 7 is 23.87, 3.41*8 is about 27.28. So 27 is a bit less than 8 times 3.41. So approximately 7.91? Let me get more precise.

3.41 * 7.9 = 3.41 * (8-0.1) = 27.28 - 0.341 = 26.939. So 7.9 gives around 26.939 GeV. We have 27 GeV, so maybe around 7.93 or so. Let's compute it accurately.

Wait, 3.41 * 7.9 = 26.939 GeV. 27 is 0.061 GeV higher. Each additional 0.01 in γ would add 3.41 * 0.01 = 0.0341 GeV. So 0.061 / 0.0341 ≈ 1.79, so 0.0179 increase in γ. So γ ≈7.9 + 0.0179 ≈7.9179. So approximately 7.92. So γ is about 7.92.

So the lifetime τ = γ τ₀. τ₀ is 8e-16 s. So τ=7.92 *8e-16 s. Let me calculate that. 7.92 *8 = 63.36. So τ=63.36e-16 s =6.336e-15 s.

Wait, but wait, no. 7.92 multiplied by 8 is actually 63.36, so yeah, 6.336e-15 s is correct.

Now, the lifetime is the time the particle exists in the lab frame. So the distance it travels before decaying is L = v * τ. But wait, what's the velocity v? Since the energy is 27 GeV, and the mass is 3.41 GeV, the kinetic energy is high, so the particle is moving at a speed close to c.

Alternatively, since the energy E is given as 27 GeV, and the mass m is 3.41 GeV, the total energy is E = γ m c², but in units where c=1, E=γ m. So, gamma is 27/3.41 ≈7.92, as before.

The velocity v can be found from beta, where beta = v/c. And beta is given by beta = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)). Wait, no, wait: beta = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E² c^4)) ), but since c=1, it's sqrt(1 - (m²)/(E²)).

So m is 3.41 GeV, E is 27 GeV. So m² is about 11.63, E² is 729. So (m/E)^2 = (3.41/27)^2 ≈ (0.1263)^2 ≈ 0.01595. So 1 - 0.01595=0.98405. So beta is sqrt(0.98405) ≈ 0.99198, so about 0.992 c. So v ≈0.992c.

So now, the distance L the particle travels is v * τ. Let's compute that.

v is 0.992c, c is 3e8 meters per second. So v = 0.992 *3e8 = 2.976e8 m/s.

τ is 6.336e-15 s. So L = 2.976e8 m/s * 6.336e-15 s = let's compute that.

Multiply 2.976e8 by 6.336e-15. 2.976 *6.336 ≈ let's see, 3 *6=18, but precise calculation:

2.976 *6.336: 2 *6.336 =12.672, 0.976 *6.336≈6.180. So total is around 12.672 +6.180=18.852. So 18.852e(8-15) = 18.852e-7 meters. 1e-7 m is 100 nm, but so 18.852e-7 m is 1.885e-6 m? Wait, wait, 18.852e-7 is 1.8852e-6 m. Yes.

So L≈1.885e-6 meters.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Oh right, I think that refers to the minimum uncertainty in the decay length measurement, such that we can see whether the decay happened or not. Wait, no, perhaps it's about the minimum resolution (like the detector's resolution) such that 30% of the decays are detected.

Wait no, perhaps it's the minimum uncertainty in the measurement (the resolution) that allows observing at least 30% of the decays. So perhaps the decay length is the proper distance the particle travels before decaying, and the resolution is the smallest length that the detector can distinguish. So if the decay length is L, then the detector must have a resolution (ΔL) such that ΔL is less than a certain fraction of L to detect a significant number of decays.

Wait, another approach: The decay length is L=βγ c τ₀. So we found L≈1.885e-6 m, which is about 1.885 micrometers. But wait, the options are in the order of 1e-9 m (nanometers), 1e-6 (micrometers), 1e-3 (mm), etc.

But the question asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Hmm, perhaps this relates to the uncertainty in the decay position. If the detector's spatial resolution (the minimum distance it can resolve) is too poor, it might not be able to detect the decay accurately.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think in terms of the decay probability. The proper lifetime is τ₀, but the observed lifetime is longer due to time dilation. The decay length is L = βγ c τ₀. And the number of decays observed depends on whether the decay occurs within the detector's volume or not.

Wait, but the problem states that we need to observe at least 30% of the decays. So perhaps the detector's resolution must be such that the length L is sufficiently large that a certain fraction of the decays are detected. Alternatively, maybe the problem is about the decay length and the minimum distance that the particle travels before decaying, so that the detector can observe the decay products.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The proper approach is probably to calculate the decay length L, and then determine the minimum resolution (like the detector's precision ΔL) needed to observe a certain fraction of the decays. But I'm not exactly sure how to connect the 30% part to the resolution.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the minimum distance (L_min) that the particle must travel so that a certain fraction (30%) of the particles decay within that distance. But that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the mean decay length L, and then the minimum resolution (ΔL) required such that the probability of the decay being observed (i.e., the decay occurring within a region that the detector can distinguish) is at least 30%. But I'm not exactly sure how to model that.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is more straightforward: the resolution required is the decay length itself. Because if the decay occurs, the particles will travel L, and to "observe" the decay, you need to measure that L. But if the detector's resolution (the smallest distance it can measure) is higher than L, then you can't see it. So the minimum resolution needed is the decay length, such that the detector can resolve it.

Wait, that makes sense. So the decay length L is the minimum resolution needed to observe the decay. So if the detector's resolution is less than L, it can detect the decay. So the minimum resolution required is the decay length.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the resolution refers to the position measurement. So, if the decay occurs at a point, and the detector has a resolution Δx, then the probability of observing the decay is the probability that the decay occurs within a region that the detector can resolve. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the decay length, which is the minimum distance that the particle travels before decaying, so that the detector can see the decay products. If the detector has a resolution (spatial resolution) higher than this length, then it can observe the decay.

So if the decay length is 1.885e-6 m (about 1.885 micrometers), then the detector's resolution must be at least that to observe the decay. But looking at the options, option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is about 2 micrometers. That's close to what I calculated.

But wait, let me recalculate L more accurately.

We had E = 27 GeV, m=3.41 GeV.

Gamma = E/m = 27 /3.41 = let me compute this more accurately.

3.41 *7 =23.87, 3.41*7.9=26.939, as before. 27 -26.939=0.061. So 0.061 /3.41 per unit gamma. So 0.061/3.41 is approximately 0.0179. So gamma is 7.9 + 0.0179 =7.9179.

So gamma is approximately 7.918.

Now, beta is sqrt(1 - (m²/E²)) = sqrt(1 - (3.41^2 / 27^2)).

Compute m²= 11.6281 GeV², E²=729 GeV².

m²/E²= 11.6281/729 ≈ 0.01595.

So 1 -0.01595=0.98405.

Beta= sqrt(0.98405)= approximately 0.99198.

So beta is about 0.992.

So L=beta * gamma * c * tau_0.

Tau_0 is 8e-16 s.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So L= 0.992 *7.918 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Let's compute each part step by step.

0.992 *7.918 = approx 7.868 (since 0.992 *8=7.936, subtract 0.992*(8-7.918)=0.992*0.082 ≈0.081, so 7.936-0.081=7.855. Hmm, maybe I should calculate it more accurately.

Wait, 7.918 *0.992:

Compute 7.918 * (1 -0.008) = 7.918 - (7.918 *0.008).

7.918 *0.008=0.063344.

So 7.918 -0.063344=7.854656.

So beta * gamma ≈7.8546.

Now, L= 7.8546 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Multiply 3e8 *8e-16 =24e-8 =2.4e-7 meters.

Now, 7.8546 *2.4e-7 = let's calculate.

7 * 2.4e-7 =1.68e-6.

0.8546 *2.4e-7 = approx 2.051e-7.

So total is 1.68e-6 + 2.051e-7 = 1.8851e-6 m.

So L=1.885e-6 meters. That's about 1.885 micrometers.

Looking at the options, option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is 2.08 micrometers. So option A is close but a bit higher than our calculation.

Wait, but perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents. Let's compute 3e8 *8e-16.

3e8 is 3 *1e8, 8e-16 is 8 *1e-16.

Multiply them: 3*8=24; exponents 1e8 *1e-16 =1e-8. So 24e-8=2.4e-7.

Yes, so 7.8546 *2.4e-7 = let me compute this accurately.

7.8546 *2.4 = let's compute 7 *2.4=16.8; 0.8546*2.4=2.05104. So total 18.85104. So 18.85104e-7 m =1.885104e-6 m.

So L≈1.885e-6 m.

But the options don't have exactly this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation or in beta.

Wait, perhaps I should redo the gamma calculation more accurately.

Gamma is E/m =27 /3.41.

Let me compute 27 /3.41 exactly.

3.41 *7 =23.87.

27-23.87=3.13.

Now, 3.41 * 0.916 (since 7.916*3.41=27) ?

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 27 /3.41.

3.41 *7 =23.87.

Left with 3.13.

3.13 /3.41 = 0.9176. So gamma is 7.9176.

So gamma is approximately 7.9176.

Beta: sqrt(1 - (m^2/E^2)).

m=3.41, E=27.

m²=3.41^2 =11.6281.

E²=27^2=729.

11.6281/729=0.01595 approximately.

So 1 -0.01595=0.98405.

sqrt(0.98405)= let me compute more accurately.

Since 0.99^2=0.9801; 0.992^2= (0.99 +0.002)^2= 0.99^2 + 2*0.99 *0.002 +0.002^2=0.9801 +0.00396 +0.000004=0.984064.

Oh, wait! That's close to our value of 0.98405.

Because 0.992^2=0.984064, which is just a bit higher than 0.98405, which is our value. So sqrt(0.98405) is just a tiny bit less than 0.992. Let's see: 0.992^2=0.984064.

Our value is 0.98405, which is 0.000014 less than 0.984064. So it's 0.992 - delta, where delta is small.

So beta ≈ 0.992 - (0.000014)/(2*0.992).

Which is approximately 0.992 - (0.000014)/(1.984) ≈0.992 - 0.00000705 ≈0.991993.

So beta is approximately 0.991993.

So beta * gamma is 0.991993 *7.9176.

Compute 0.991993 *7.9176.

Let me compute:

7.9176 *0.991993.

Approximate:

7.9176 *0.99 = 7.8484.

7.9176 *0.001993= approx 0.01578.

Total ≈7.8484 +0.01578=7.8642.

Wait, but perhaps a better way is to compute 7.9176*(1 -0.008007) =7.9176 -7.9176*0.008007.

7.9176 *0.008007= approx 0.06343.

So 7.9176 -0.06343=7.85417.

So beta * gamma ≈7.85417.

Now, back to L= beta gamma c tau_0.

c is 3e8 m/s.

tau_0=8e-16 s.

So L=7.85417 *3e8 *8e-16.

Compute 3e8 *8e-16 =24e-8=2.4e-7 m.

Multiply by 7.85417: 7.85417 *2.4e-7.

7 *2.4=16.8, 0.85417 *2.4=2.050008.

So 16.8e-7 +2.05e-7 =18.85e-7 m=1.885e-6 m.

So L≈1.885e-6 meters, which is 1.885 micrometers.

Looking at the options again:

A) 2.08e-6 m (2.08 micrometers)
B) 2.08e-9 m (2.08 nm)
C) 2.08e-1 m (20.8 cm)
D) 2.08e-3 m (2.08 mm)

Hmm, option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is about 0.1 micrometers higher than our calculated 1.885e-6 m. So why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check if the initial formula is correct.

The decay length L is given by L = beta * gamma * c * tau_0.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the energy used is wrong? The problem states the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV. So E =27 GeV is the total energy of the X⁰ particle. So yes, gamma is 27/3.41 ≈7.9176.

Wait, but maybe I should use relativistic equations differently.

Another approach: The lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau_0.

So the time the particle exists is t=gamma tau_0.

The speed is v= beta c.

So distance L= v t = beta c gamma tau_0.

Yes, which is the same as before.

So L= beta gamma c tau_0.

So the calculation seems correct.

So why is the option A 2.08e-6 m, which is about 15% higher than our calculation?

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in beta*gamma.

Wait, let's compute beta gamma more accurately.

gamma=27/3.41= let's compute it with more precision.

3.41 *7.9176=?

Wait, 3.41 *7=23.87.

3.41 *0.9176= let's compute that.

0.9 *3.41=3.069.

0.0176 *3.41=0.059936.

So 3.069 +0.059936=3.128936.

So 3.41 *7.9176=23.87+3.128936=26.998936 ≈27. So yes, gamma=7.9176.

Beta= sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2))=sqrt(1 - (3.41^2)/(27^2)).

3.41^2=11.6281.

27^2=729.

11.6281/729=0.01595.

So 1-0.01595=0.98405.

sqrt(0.98405)= approximately 0.991993.

So beta=0.991993.

So beta * gamma=0.991993 *7.9176.

Compute this more accurately.

0.991993 *7 =6.943951.

0.991993 *0.9176= let's compute:

0.991993 *0.9=0.8927937.

0.991993 *0.0176=0.0174711.

So total 0.9102648.

So total beta gamma=6.943951 +0.9102648=7.8542158.

So beta gamma ≈7.8542.

So L=beta gamma c tau_0=7.8542 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Compute 3e8 *8e-16=24e-8=2.4e-7 m.

Multiply by 7.8542: 7.8542 * 2.4e-7.

Compute 7 *2.4=16.8, 0.8542 *2.4=2.05008.

Total 18.85008e-7 m =1.885008e-6 m.

So approximately 1.885 micrometers.

The options have option A as 2.08e-6 m. Which is about 2.08 micrometers. So why is there a difference?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta gamma. Alternatively, perhaps the mass is in MeV? No, the problem states mass is 3.41 GeV, so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the proper lifetime is given in seconds, but I used it correctly.

Wait, the proper lifetime is 8e-16 seconds. Yes.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the average decay length, and the minimum resolution is the decay length. So the correct answer would be the decay length. So the answer would be approximately 1.885e-6 m, but none of the options match exactly.

Hmm, the options are:

A)2.08e-6 m

B)2.08e-9 m

C)2.08e-1 m

D)2.08e-3 m.

Wait, 2.08e-6 is 2.08 micrometers. Our calculation is 1.885e-6 m. So perhaps the correct option is A, but why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated beta*gamma.

Wait, perhaps the error comes from the approximation of beta as 0.992. Let me compute beta more accurately.

We have beta = sqrt(1- (m²)/(E²)).

Compute 1- m²/E²=1 - (3.41^2)/(27^2) =1 - (11.6281)/(729) =1 - 0.015954 ≈0.984046.

Beta = sqrt(0.984046) = ?

Let me compute sqrt(0.984046) accurately.

We know that 0.992^2=0.984064.

Our value is 0.984046, which is 0.000018 less than 0.984064. So beta is slightly less than 0.992.

The difference in beta between 0.992 and a bit lower.

Let me use linear approximation. Let x=0.992, f(x)=x².

We have f(x)=0.984064.

We need f(x-delta)=0.984046.

df= -2 x delta ≈0.984064 -0.984046=0.000018.

So delta≈0.000018/(2 *0.992)=0.00000909.

So beta=0.992 -0.00000909≈0.99199091.

So beta is approximately 0.99199091.

So beta*gamma=0.99199091 *7.9176.

Compute accurately:

7.9176 *0.99199091.

Let me compute 7.9176 *0.99199091.

Break it down: 7.9176 * (1 - 0.00800909) =7.9176 - (7.9176 *0.00800909).

Compute 7.9176 *0.00800909.

0.008 *7.9176=0.0633408.

0.00000909 *7.9176≈0.0000720.

So total is approximately 0.0633408 +0.0000720=0.0634128.

So beta*gamma=7.9176 -0.0634128=7.8541872.

So L= 7.8541872 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

3e8 *8e-16=24e-8=2.4e-7 m.

Multiply by 7.8541872: 7.8541872 *2.4e-7.

7 *2.4=16.8e-7.

0.8541872 *2.4e-7= let me compute 0.8541872 *2.4=2.05005.

So total is 16.8e-7 +2.05005e-7=18.85005e-7=1.885005e-6 m.

So L=1.885e-6 m.

Hmm, but the closest option is A, which is 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me check the beta and gamma again.

Alternatively, maybe the initial formula is wrong. Wait, another approach: the mean path length (decay length) is L=gamma * v * tau_0.

Wait, but v=beta c, so L=gamma beta c tau_0.

Which is the same as before.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is about the minimum detectable length being such that the probability of the decay being observed is 30%. So the decay length is L, and the resolution is the minimum uncertainty (ΔL) such that the probability (P) that the decay occurs within ΔL is at least 30%.

Wait, but that seems more complicated. The decay follows an exponential distribution, so the probability that the decay occurs after time t is P(t) = exp(-t/(gamma tau_0)).

Wait, no, the particle decays with probability proportional to the time. The average decay length is gamma beta c tau_0, but the decay length distribution is exponential.

Wait, the decay length probability is P(L) = (1/L_avg) exp(-L / L_avg), where L_avg is the average decay length (gamma beta c tau_0).

So to find the minimum ΔL such that the probability of the decay occurring within a distance ΔL is ≥30%, we can integrate P(L) from 0 to ΔL and set it equal to 0.3.

The integral of P(L) dL from 0 to x is 1 - exp(-x/L_avg).

So 1 - exp(-x/L_avg) ≥0.3 → exp(-x/L_avg) ≤0.7 → -x/L_avg ≤ ln(0.7) → x ≥ - L_avg ln(0.7).

ln(0.7) is approximately -0.35667.

So x ≥ L_avg * 0.35667.

So the minimum ΔL needed is 0.35667 * L_avg.

Wait, so if L_avg is 1.885e-6 m, then ΔL >= 1.885e-6 *0.35667 ≈ approx 0.67e-6 m.

But that's about 0.67 micrometers, which is less than option A's 2.08 micrometers. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. The question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So perhaps the decay length must be larger than the resolution for 30% of the cases. Hmm, but I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the decay length as L=gamma c tau_0, ignoring beta. But that would be incorrect, as beta is part of the formula.

Wait, let me compute L without considering beta. L=gamma c tau_0.

Gamma=7.9176, c=3e8 m/s, tau0=8e-16 s.

So L=7.9176 *3e8 *8e-16.

3e8 *8e-16=24e-8=2.4e-7 m.

Multiply by 7.9176: 7.9176 *2.4e-7 =19.002e-7=1.9002e-6 m.

Which is about 1.9e-6 m. Option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is close to this.

Wait, but beta is 0.992, so including it, the L is about 1.885e-6 m. So perhaps the question expects us to ignore beta, and just use gamma c tau_0. Then L would be about 1.9e-6 m, which is close to option A.

So perhaps that's the approach the question wants. But that would be an incorrect approach because L should include beta as well. So why is this discrepancy?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum path length that the particle travels, which is the average decay length, and the minimum resolution is 30% of that.

Wait, the question says "minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays." Hmm, perhaps that refers to the fraction of the decay length that must be resolved to detect the decay. So perhaps the detector must be able to resolve a distance of at least 30% of the average decay length.

So 30% of 1.885e-6 m is 0.5655e-6 m. But none of the options match that.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution such that 30% of the decays are detected, which would relate to the detector's ability to measure the decay length. If the detector's resolution is less than the decay length, it can't resolve the decay. So the minimum resolution would be the decay length itself. Because if the resolution is lower than the decay length, you can see the decay.

Wait, but that doesn't directly tie into the 30% part. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the minimum resolution to be 30% of the decay length. So 0.3 * L.

Wait, but that would give 0.565e-6 m, which is 0.565 micrometers, which isn't any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum uncertainty in the decay length measurement such that 30% of the decays are observed. But I'm not sure how to model that.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The answer seems to be option A, 2.08e-6 m, which is 2.08 micrometers. Our calculated decay length is about 1.885 micrometers, but perhaps the options have a rounding factor. Maybe the question expects the answer to be option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, and the correct L is 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, let me compute gamma again.

27 GeV / 3.41 GeV = 7.9176.

Beta: sqrt(1 - (3.41/27)^2) = sqrt(1 - (0.1263)^2) = sqrt(1 -0.01595) = sqrt(0.98405)= approx 0.99199.

So beta * gamma =7.9176 * 0.99199 ≈7.854.

So L=7.854 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s =7.854 *2.4e-7 m =18.8496e-7 m=1.88496e-6 m.

So this is about 1.885 micrometers.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps it's option A, which is 2.08e-6 m.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial calculation is correct and the answer is option A. Alternatively, perhaps the correct calculation is to compute gamma as E/(m c²), but since we're using units where c=1, it's just E/m.

Wait, perhaps the energy is kinetic energy, not the total energy. Hmm, that's a possibility. Let me check the question again.

The question states: "the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV." It doesn't specify whether it's total energy or kinetic energy. If it's kinetic energy, then the total energy is K + m c² =27 GeV +3.41 GeV=30.41 GeV.

So gamma would be E/m =30.41 /3.41≈8.90.

Wait, that would change things.

So if E is kinetic energy, then total energy is E_kinetic + m c².

So E=27 GeV is kinetic energy, so total energy E_total =27 +3.41=30.41 GeV.

Gamma=E_total/m=30.41/3.41= approx 8.90.

Then beta would be sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E_total^2)).

Compute m^2=11.6281, E_total²= (30.41)^2= approx 924. So 11.6281/924≈0.01258.

1-0.01258=0.98742.

sqrt(0.98742)=approx 0.9937.

So beta=0.9937.

Then L= beta gamma c tau_0.

Compute beta gamma=0.9937 *8.90≈8.83.

So L=8.83 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

3e8 *8e-16=24e-8=2.4e-7 m.

8.83 *2.4e-7=21.192e-7=2.1192e-6 m.

So L≈2.12e-6 m.

Which is close to option A's 2.08e-6 m.

Ah, this makes sense now. So perhaps the initial assumption was wrong, and the energy given is the kinetic energy, not the total energy.

So the correct approach would be:

If E is kinetic energy, then E_total = E_kin + m c² =27 +3.41=30.41 GeV.

Gamma=E_total/m=30.41/3.41≈8.90.

Beta= sqrt(1 - (m²/E_total²))=sqrt(1 - (3.41/30.41)^2).

Compute (3.41/30.41)^2≈(0.11217)^2≈0.01258.

So 1-0.01258=0.98742.

sqrt(0.98742)= approx 0.9937.

So beta=0.9937.

So beta gamma=0.9937 *8.90≈8.83.

So L=8.83 *3e8 *8e-16.

Compute 3e8 *8e-16=2.4e-7 m.

8.83 *2.4e-7=21.192e-7=2.1192e-6 m≈2.12e-6 m.

Which is approximately 2.08e-6 m, matching option A.

So the correct answer would be option A.

But wait, the problem states that the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV. Typically, when physicists refer to the energy of a particle in an accelerator, it's the kinetic energy if the mass is much smaller than the energy. But in this case, the mass is 3.41 GeV, and 27 GeV is the energy. So perhaps the energy refers to the kinetic energy.

Ah, that's probably where the confusion was. So in this problem, the energy is the kinetic energy, not the total energy. So the calculation gives us L≈2.12e-6 m, which is closest to option A (2.08e-6 m).

So the answer should be option A.


To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle \( X^0 \) in the CERN Bubble Chamber, we calculate the decay length \( L \) that the particle travels before decaying. The decay length is given by:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau_0
\]

where:
- \( \tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \) is the proper lifetime of \( X^0 \),
- \( \beta = v/c \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m} \) is the Lorentz factor, with \( E = 27 \, \text{GeV} \) (total energy) and \( m = 3.41 \, \text{GeV} \) (mass of \( X^0 \)),
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor is:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{27}{3.41} \approx 7.92
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \beta \)
The velocity \( \beta \) is determined using the relativistic relation:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{m^2}{E^2}}
\]

Substituting \( m = 3.41 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( E = 27 \, \text{GeV} \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{(3.41)^2}{(27)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{11.6281}{729}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.01595} = \sqrt{0.98405} \approx 0.992
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \beta \gamma \)
The product \( \beta \gamma \) is:

\[
\beta \gamma = 0.992 \times 7.92 \approx 7.85
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the decay length \( L \)
The decay length is:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau_0
\]

Substituting \( \beta \gamma = 7.85 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \):

\[
L = 7.85 \times (3 \times 10^8) \times (8 \times 10^{-16}) = 7.85 \times 2.4 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \approx 1.885 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}
\]

Thus, the decay length is approximately \( 1.885 \, \mu\text{m} \).

### Step 5: Interpret the question and match with options
The problem asks for the **minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays**. This implies that the detector's resolution must be sufficient to resolve the decay length \( L \). Among the given options, the closest value to the calculated decay length is:

\[
\text{Option A: } 2.08 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}
\]

This slight discrepancy could arise from rounding or approximations in the problem setup.

### Final Answer:
\[
\text{Answer: A}
\]
