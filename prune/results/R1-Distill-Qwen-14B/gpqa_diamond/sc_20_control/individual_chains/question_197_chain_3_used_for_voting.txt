Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. So, the question is about identifying a compound after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. The given data includes IR and NMR spectra, and there are four options to choose from.

First, I'll start by analyzing the IR data. The IR peaks can tell me about the functional groups present in the compound. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates either O-H (like in an alcohol or carboxylic acid) or N-H (amines), but since there's a 1720 cm-1 peak, that's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. 1720 is typically a carbonyl in a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester or carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids usually have a broad O-H peak around 2500-3300, which is in the 3400–2500 range mentioned here. So maybe a carboxylic acid? Or perhaps an aldehyde or ketone.

Looking at the other IR peaks, 1610 and 1450 cm-1. Those are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching. So the compound probably has an aromatic ring. So, putting this together, maybe it's a substituted aromatic ring with a carbonyl group, like a benzene ring attached to a carbonyl.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data. Let's list them out:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet. Could be an O-H proton, like in a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, an aldehyde proton is around 9-10, but that's more like 9-10. But a broad peak at 10.5 might be more indicative of a carboxylic acid. Aldehydes usually have a sharp peak around 9.5-10, but this is higher and broader. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

But wait, another possibility is an exchange with the solvent or DMSO, but in NMR, a broad peak at 10.5 is more likely a carboxylic acid -OH. So that suggests a carboxylic acid group.

The next peak is 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). These look like two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in a para substitution, the protons are split into two doublets, each with two protons, and they are para to each other. So the aromatic ring is probably para-substituted.

Then, 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). These are probably part of a substituent attached to the benzene ring.

Let me try to piece this together. The aromatic ring is para-substituted. One substituent is a carbonyl group (from the IR 1720 cm-1). Wait, but if it's a benzene ring with a carbonyl group, like a ketone, then in the NMR, the carbonyl would show up as a peak. But wait, the 10.5 ppm peak is probably the O-H of a carboxylic acid, not a ketone. So maybe the substituent is a carboxylic acid group attached to the benzene ring. So the benzene ring has a COOH group and another substituent.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That would fit. Let me think about the structure. Benzoic acid has a COOH group attached to benzene. If it's 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, the substituents are in para positions. So the benzene ring has a COOH group and a sec-butyl group at the para positions.

So the NMR of the benzene ring would have two sets of doublets. The protons adjacent to the substituents would be split. Let me think: if the benzene has substituents in the para positions, the protons on the ring would be two sets of doublets. The substituents would cause the ring protons to split into these doublets. For example, in benzoic acid, the two protons ortho to the COOH group are deshielded and appear as a pair of doublets.

So in the NMR, the 8.0 and 7.2 ppm peaks fit that scenario. Now, the other parts of the NMR: the 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H), the 1.7 ppm multiplet (2H), 1.4 ppm doublet (3H), and 0.9 ppm triplet (3H). Let's analyze these.

The triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) is likely a methyl group attached to a CH2 group. The doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH. Wait, maybe it's a branching point. Let me think about the structure.

In a sec-butyl group, the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3). So the substituent on the benzene would be a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. Wait, no, wait: sec-butyl is -CH(CH2CH2CH3)? No, wait, no. Let's get that right. The structure of isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2, but wait, no, that's tert-butyl. Wait, sec-butyl is -CH2CH(CH2CH3). Hmm, no, wait. Let me recall: the substituents for butyl groups.

Butyl groups: n-butyl is CH2CH2CH2CH2-, but that's linear. iso-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but wait, no. Wait, iso-butyl is (CH2)CHCH2CH3? No, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The structure of sec-butyl is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no. Wait, the correct structure: sec-butyl is (CH2)2CHCH2-? No, wait, alternatively, the substituent is a four-carbon chain in a branching manner.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the NMR. The triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) suggests a CH2CH2CH3 group. The doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H) is probably a methyl group attached to a CH group.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider the substituent as a butyl group attached to the benzene. So the substituent is a -CH2CH2CH2CH3 group, but that's n-butyl. Alternatively, if it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, that's isobutyl, perhaps.

Wait, the NMR data shows:

1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Maybe a CH2 group attached to something.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): Maybe a CH group attached to another CH2.

So the substituent is probably a group like -CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, perhaps it's a -CH2CH2CH(CH3) group? Hmm, not sure. Let me try to draw it out.

Alternatively, the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. For example, a sec-butyl group would be -CH2-CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, sec-butyl is -CH2-CH(CH3)-. No, wait, no. Let me think again.

The substituent is probably a sec-butyl group, which is -CH(CH2CH2CH3). Wait, no, no. Wait, the correct structure for sec-butyl is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. No, perhaps I should check the possible structures.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look at the options again.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

So option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the substituents on the benzene are a COOH group and a sec-butyl group in the para positions.

So the substituent (sec-butyl) would be -CH2-CH(CH2CH3) attached to the benzene.

Wait, no, the structure of sec-butyl is actually -CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, the correct structure for sec-butyl is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. No, wait, that's not right. Wait, what's the structure of a sec-butyl group?

Wait, the butyl group can be n-butyl, iso-butyl, or tert-butyl. The iso-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)2. No, wait, iso-butyl is a three-carbon branch off the main chain. Let me think: the substituent is a four-carbon chain, but in a branch. So iso-butyl is -CH2-CH(CH3)2? No, that's not correct. Wait, correct structure: the iso-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting myself confused. Let's think of the substituent's NMR.

Looking at the NMR data: the 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) likely corresponds to a methyl group attached to a CH2. The 1.7 ppm multiplet (2H) could be two protons on a CH2 adjacent to branching. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) is a methyl attached to a CH. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is perhaps a CH group attached to something else.

Putting this together, the substituent is likely a isopropyl group, but let's think further. Alternatively, considering the substituent as -CH2CH(CH2CH3), which would make it a pentyl group? No, perhaps not.

Wait, the substituent is a sec-butyl group. So the structure would be -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. So the substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3) attached to the benzene.

Wait, but in that case, the NMR signals would reflect the structure. Let me think about the splitting.

The -CH2-CH(CH2CH3) group would have the following protons:

- The CH2 next to the benzene (let's say it's the first CH2 group) would be adjacent to a CH group. The protons on the first CH2 would be split by the neighboring CH. These are the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) and 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) signals. Hmm, perhaps the 2.9 ppm is the CH (the central CH in the substituent), and the 1.7 ppm is the adjacent CH2 group.

Then, the CH(CH2CH3) would have a methyl group attached. The CH2CH3 would have a triplet at 0.9 ppm, as the terminal methyl. The CH2 adjacent to the CH would have a doublet of quartets or something, but the 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) seems a bit off. Alternatively, maybe the CH(CH2CH3) has a methyl group that's a doublet.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group. The structure would be CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to benzene. So the substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

So the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3) group.

In this structure, the CH2 next to the benzene (the first CH2) would split into a triplet or something, but the NMR shows a multiplet at 2.9 ppm (1H) which is probably the CH in the middle. The 1.7 ppm (2H) would be the adjacent CH2, and the 1.4 ppm (3H) is the methyl attached to the CH.

Wait, but the methyl on the CH is two carbons away from the benzene. So the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3) group.

Alternatively, if the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch, like a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a tert-butyl group, but that would have a different NMR.

Wait, let me think about the substituent in option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

So the substituent is a sec-butyl group on the para position of the benzoic acid.

The structure of the substituent would be: the benzene ring has a COOH group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

So the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group attached to the benzene.

Wait, but the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. So the substituent is a butyl group where the branching is on the second carbon.

So, for the NMR of this substituent:

The benzene is attached to the first carbon, which is a CH2. Then the second carbon is CH attached to a CH2CH3 group.

So looking at the substituent:

- Benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)

The protons on the CH2 (first carbon) would be adjacent to the CH group. So each proton on the CH2 would split into a triplet due to coupling with the CH group (which has one proton). So the CH2 (first carbon) would be a triplet, perhaps showing up as a multiplet around 2.9 ppm (1H) for the CH, and the CH2 (first carbon) would be around 1.7 ppm (m, 2H).

The CH group (second carbon) has one proton, which is split by the adjacent CH2 and possibly the adjacent CH2CH3. So that's the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H).

The CH2CH3 group (third carbon) would have the terminal methyl group, which is a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) because it's attached to a CH2. That makes sense.

Wait, but the CH2CH3 would have a quartet for the CH2 that's adjacent to the CH group. Hmm, but in the NMR, we have a triplet at 0.9 ppm, which fits the methyl group.

Wait, but the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, so the CH2 (first) would be connected to the benzene. The CH (second) is connected to the CH2CH3. So the protons on the CH2 (first) would be split by the CH (second), which has one proton. So each proton on the CH2 would be split into a doublet of doublets? Or perhaps a triplet? Because each of the two protons on the CH2 is coupling with the single proton on the adjacent CH.

So the CH2 would likely appear as a triplet, but in the NMR, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet (2H). Hmm, perhaps it's a triplet or a more complex splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is part of a CH2-CH- group, leading to coupling with the adjacent CH group, but also possibly with other groups, leading to a multiplet.

The CH group (second carbon) would have one proton, which is coupled with the two protons on the adjacent CH2 and possibly the three protons on the CH2CH3. But given that the CH group is between the CH2 and CH2CH3, it's likely that the CH proton is split into a triplet or a multiplet. The NMR shows it as a multiplet at 2.9 ppm (1H).

The CH2CH3 group would have the terminal methyl, which is a triplet at 0.9 ppm.

So putting this together, the substituent's NMR data matches the given values.

So the compound is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is option C.

Now, the reaction: Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

Wait, what does that reaction do? Red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the hydrolysis of an ester, or maybe in the cleavage of a nitrile to an amine? Wait, no, more commonly, red phosphorus with HI is used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to amines. Wait, but wait, another possibility: it could be the Hofmann elimination, but that's with amines and a base. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction to form an acid from an ester.

Wait, another thought: Red phosphorus and HI can be used to reduce carbonyl groups. For example, in the reduction of a nitrile to an amine, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's used in the cleavage of a sulfonic acid group, but that's not applicable here.

Wait, another possibility: The reaction could be the hydrolysis of an acyl chloride. But with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps it's the hydrolysis of an ester.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an ester. When an ester reacts with HI in the presence of red phosphorus, what happens? Red phosphorus is often used to remove water in certain reactions, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe it's the conversion of a nitrile to an amine. Nitriles can be hydrolyzed to amines using red phosphorus and HI, but that would form a primary amine.

Alternatively, another possibility: The reaction could be the cleavage of an acyl chloride. Red phosphorus can be used to convert acid chlorides to acids. For example, when an acid chloride (RCOCl) reacts with red phosphorus, it forms the corresponding acid (RCOOH) and phosporus oxychloride (POCl3).

Wait, if that's the case, then the starting material would be an acyl chloride. So, if the starting compound X is an acyl chloride, and it reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it would form a carboxylic acid.

Looking back at the options, the product after reaction is one of the options. But wait, the options are for the product of the reaction. So the question is asking, after X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, which product do we get?

Wait, but the options are given as possible products. So perhaps X is a nitrile, and the reaction converts it into an amine. Or if X is an ester, the reaction may hydrolyze it to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but considering the IR data of X: the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl. If it's an ester, the carbonyl would be around 1740-1720 cm-1. If it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700 cm-1, but carboxylic acids usually have a broad O-H stretch in the IR as well. The IR data given also has a peak at 3400-2500 cm-1, which could be O-H of a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Wait, but if X is a nitrile, the IR wouldn't have a 1720 cm-1 peak. Nitriles have a C≡N stretch around 2200 cm-1, which isn't present here.

Wait, X's IR has 1720 cm-1, which is more likely an ester or ketone. But the NMR data suggests a carboxylic acid.

Wait, maybe X is an ester. Then, when treated with red phosphorus and HI, it would undergo hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, another possibility is that X is a nitrile, which upon hydrolysis would form an amine, but that doesn't fit the NMR data.

Wait, another reaction: The use of red phosphorus and HI is known for the von Braun degradation, which converts nitriles to ketones. But that would require specific conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of an acid chloride. Acid chlorides (RCOCl) react with water in the presence of a catalyst to form carboxylic acids. But red phosphorus and HI might not be the typical conditions for that.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a nitrile, and the reaction produces an amine. For example, when a nitrile (R–C≡N) is treated with H3P and HI, it can be hydrolyzed to a primary amine (R–CH2–NH2). But in this case, the starting material X has a benzoic acid group and a sec-butyl substituent. If X were a nitrile, the product would be an amine, but the options don't include amines.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe the reaction is the hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid. For example, if X is an ester, RCOOR', then upon hydrolysis, it would form RCOOH (the acid) and R'OH. But what's the role of red phosphorus and HI here? I think red phosphorus is sometimes used as a dehydrating agent, perhaps in the conversion of an acid chloride to an acid.

Wait, but in the case of an ester, the hydrolysis typically requires acid or base catalysis. Red phosphorus and HI might be used in a specific way. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is converting an alkyne to a ketone, but that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a ketene, which can be hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the product options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If X is the ester of this acid, say RCOOR', then upon hydrolysis, it would become RCOOH. So if X is the ester, and the reaction is hydrolysis, then the product would be the carboxylic acid, which is option C.

But wait, the question says that X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, and we need to find the product. So if X is the ester, then the product is the acid (option C). But let me make sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a nitrile, and the reaction converts it into an amine. But none of the options are amines.

Another angle: The IR of X shows a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl. The NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad singlet, likely a carboxylic acid. So X has a carboxylic acid group.

Wait, but if X is a carboxylic acid, then what reaction would it undergo with red phosphorus and HI? Carboxylic acids are generally not very reactive towards HI, unless under specific conditions. Alternatively, perhaps X is an acid chloride, but then the IR would show a peak around 1800 cm-1 for the C=O.

Wait, maybe X is a benzoyl chloride. If X is benzoyl chloride (PhCOCl), then reaction with HI and red phosphorus would convert it into benzoic acid. But in that case, the structure would be benzoic acid with substituents.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So if X is the corresponding acid chloride, then the product would be the acid.

But in the NMR of X, we have a 10.5 ppm peak, which fits a carboxylic acid. So X is already a carboxylic acid. Then, what reaction would it undergo with red phosphorus and HI?

Wait, perhaps X is a nitrile. But the NMR of X shows a 10.5 ppm peak, which would not be present in a nitrile. Nitriles have protons on adjacent carbons but not a broad peak at 10.5 ppm.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the reaction again. Red phosphorus and HI are used in several reactions, but one common use is the hydrolysis of nitriles to amines. The reaction is: R–C≡N + H3P + HI → R–CH2–NH2. Alternatively, another possibility is the conversion of an acid chloride to an acid.

But wait, if X is an acid chloride, then the product would be the corresponding carboxylic acid. So if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoyl chloride, then the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is option C.

But the question is about the product after X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. So, if X is the acid chloride, then the product is the acid (option C).

But wait, the NMR data of X shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which would correspond to a carboxylic acid. So X is a carboxylic acid, not an acid chloride. But if X is a carboxylic acid, why would it react with red phosphorus and HI? That doesn't seem likely.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester. The ester would have a carbonyl peak around 1720 cm-1, which matches the IR. The NMR data would then show a peak for the ester's O-H? No, esters don't have O-H; they have an OR group. But the IR shows a peak in 3400-2500, which could be an alkoxy group or something else.

Wait, if X is an ester, the IR would have a peak around 1720 cm-1 for the C=O, and the 3400-2500 region could be from an alcohol or maybe an alkoxy group. But in the NMR, the 10.5 ppm peak suggests a carboxylic acid, which wouldn't be present in an ester. So X can't be an ester.

Wait, perhaps X is a ketone. The IR would have a peak around 1720 cm-1. The NMR would not have a peak at 10.5 ppm, as ketones don't have protons on the carbonyl. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the possible structures again.

The NMR data suggests a carboxylic acid (10.5 ppm peak), a para-substituted benzene ring with two substituents (the COOH and another group), and a substituent that's a sec-butyl group.

So X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. But then, what would happen when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI?

Wait, but red phosphorus and HI are typically used in reactions that require acidic conditions. For example, in the hydrolysis of nitriles to amines. But if X is already a carboxylic acid, what would happen? Maybe nothing, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps X is an acid anhydride. Acid anhydrides can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids, but again, I'm not sure about the role of red phosphorus.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is the conversion of a nitrile to an amine, but I don't see how that applies here.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the options and the reaction conditions.

The options are the products after the reaction. If X is an ester, and the reaction is hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid, then option C would be the product.

But according to the given data, X already has the structure of option C. So that can't be. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my initial analysis.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating X's structure. Let me reevaluate the NMR.

The NMR shows a singlet at 10.5 ppm, which is broad, suggesting exchange, like a carboxylic acid. The aromatic protons are two doublets, so a para-substituted benzene. The substituents are COOH and another group.

The substituent's NMR: 2.9 (m, 1H), 1.7 (m, 2H), 1.4 (d, 3H), 0.9 (t, 3H).

So the substituent is a branched group. The 0.9 ppm triplet suggests a CH2CH2CH3 group. The 1.4 ppm doublet suggests a CH(CH3) group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)2. No, that would be a tert-butyl group. Wait, tert-butyl is (CH3)3C-.

But the NMR doesn't fit that. Let me reconsider. The substituent is a four-carbon chain, perhaps a butyl group with branching.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a iso-propyl group.

Wait, the substituent's NMR:

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): terminal methyl.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a methyl attached to a CH.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): two protons, likely on a CH2 adjacent to a branching point.
- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): a CH group attached to branching.

So, the substituent is likely a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3) group, which is a sec-butyl group.

So X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Now, what's the reaction?

When X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, which is concentrated HI in the presence of red phosphorus, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of elimination or substitution.

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps X is a nitrile, and the reaction is converting it to a carboxylic acid. But I don't see nitrile peaks in the IR. The IR has a peak at 1720, which would be a carbonyl, not a nitrile.

Alternatively, maybe X is an ester, which upon hydrolysis gives the acid. But in that case, X would have an ester group (R-O-CO-) in the NMR. But the NMR doesn't show any O-R groups; instead, it shows a broad peak at 10.5 ppm, suggesting a COOH group.

So perhaps X is already a carboxylic acid, and the reaction doesn't change it. That can't be right because the question says it reacts to form a product.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something here. Let me think about the reaction again.

Red phosphorus and HI can be used to reduce nitriles to amines. But if X is a nitrile, then the product would be an amine, but none of the options are amines.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an acid chloride, and the reaction converts it into a carboxylic acid. So if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoyl chloride, then the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is option C. But the initial data suggests X is a carboxylic acid.

This is getting confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the cleavage of an ester to form a carboxylic acid. But again, X would have to be an ester, which doesn't fit the NMR.

Wait, could the reaction be a dehydration? For example, if X is a secondary alcohol, the reaction could form an alkene. But the NMR doesn't support that.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an elimination reaction forming an alkene. Let me look at the possible substituents.

If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, perhaps the reaction is removing a water molecule from the substituent to form an alkene. But that would require specific conditions, and I don't see how red phosphorus and HI would do that.

Wait, another thought: When a carboxylic acid is treated with HI, it can undergo decarboxylation under certain conditions. For example, if the carboxylic acid is β-keto, but 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid isn't a β-keto acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is adjacent to the COOH group, making it a β-keto acid. But in this case, the substituent is para to the COOH group, so that wouldn't be the case.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess. Based on the NMR and IR, X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI doesn't seem to change it, but the question says it reacts. So perhaps I'm missing something about the reaction.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe X is a nitrile derivative, and the reaction converts it into an amine. But the NMR doesn't fit that.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a ester, and the reaction converts it into an acid, making option C the product.

But the NMR data of X suggests it's a carboxylic acid. So I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't about X being an acid or ester but something else. Let's think about the options again.

Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That would be a toluene derivative with a sec-butyl and methyl group. But the NMR doesn't fit that.

Option B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene, which would be a toluene with isobutyl and methyl substituents. But again, the NMR doesn't seem to fit.

Option A is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. That's a propanoic acid with a 4-ethylphenyl group. The NMR would show a triplet for the ethyl group, etc.

But given the data, I think option C is the correct structure for X. If the reaction is converting an ester to an acid, then option C would be the product, but X is already an acid.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying X. Maybe X isn't a carboxylic acid but an ester. Let me reevaluate the NMR.

The 10.5 ppm peak is broad, which is characteristic of a carboxylic acid. So X must have a COOH group. So the product after reaction must be something else.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is converting a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. So X is a nitrile, but that doesn't fit the IR or NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a ketone that is being reduced to an alcohol. But the IR doesn't show a peak for a ketone's C=O.

Wait, another possibility: The reaction is converting an acid chloride to an acid. So X is an acid chloride, which upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI becomes a carboxylic acid. So if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoyl chloride, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is option C.

But the initial data, including the NMR, suggests X is already a carboxylic acid. So I'm confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is converting an alkyne to a ketone. But that doesn't fit the data.

Wait, another thought: Maybe X is a benzene ring with a substituent that is a bromo group and a ketone. Then, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI could be a substitution or elimination.

But I don't think that's the case. I'm stuck. Let me try to look for another angle.

The reaction conditions: red phosphorus and HI are often used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to primary amines. So if X is a nitrile, the product would be an amine. But none of the options are amines.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the conversion of a nitrile to an amine via the Stephen reduction, but that typically uses H2 and a catalyst, not HI and red phosphorus.

Hmm. I'm going in circles here. Given the time I've spent, I'll make an educated guess based on the data.

The NMR and IR data point towards X being 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). The reaction with red phosphorus and HI doesn't change it, but perhaps I'm missing a reaction that doesn't alter the structure but the question states it reacts. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is the dehydration of the substituent, but I can't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the substituent changes. But without more info, I can't be certain.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe X is a ester, and the reaction is hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid. If X is the ester, the product is option C. So perhaps the correct answer is option C.

The question involves identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The analysis begins with the IR and NMR data provided for Compound X.

### IR Analysis:
- The peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** indicates a carbonyl group (C=O).
- The broad peak in the **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** range suggests an O-H group, likely from a carboxylic acid.
- Peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** are consistent with aromatic C=C stretching.

### NMR Analysis:
- **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: A broad singlet, characteristic of a carboxylic acid O-H proton.
- **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, indicating a para-substituted benzene ring.
- **2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: These signals correspond to a branched alkyl group, likely a sec-butyl group.

### Structure of Compound X:
Based on the IR and NMR data, Compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This structure features a para-substituted benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a sec-butyl group (-CH₂-CH(CH₂CH₃)).

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
Red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the hydrolysis of acid chlorides to carboxylic acids. However, since Compound X is already a carboxylic acid, the reaction does not alter its structure. The product remains **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid**: This structure does not match the NMR data, as it would lack a sec-butyl group and have a different substitution pattern.
- **B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**: This is an aromatic compound without a carboxylic acid group, inconsistent with the IR and NMR data.
- **C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**: Matches the IR and NMR data perfectly and is the correct structure for Compound X.
- **D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**: This is an aromatic compound without a carboxylic acid group, inconsistent with the IR and NMR data.

### Conclusion:
Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**, and the reaction with red phosphorus and HI does not change its structure. Therefore, the final product is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.
