Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the normalization constant 'a' for a wave function. Let me read the problem again carefully.

The setup is that we have ten thousand identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (the x-axis). The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, where i is the square root of -1. When they measured the position of the particles, none were found outside the region x=1 to x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside this interval, but the problem says the wave function is defined as that expression in the region where it can exist. Hmm, wait, I'm a bit confused. Wait, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. But if the particle isn't found outside x=1 to x=3, that means the wave function is zero elsewhere. So the wave function exists between x=1 and x=3, and is zero otherwise. So the given wave function is valid only between x=1 and x=3.

Wait, but the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i. Wait, that can't be right because wave functions have both real and imaginary parts, but when I measure the probability, I need the absolute square of the wave function, which is |ψ|^2. So in this case, the wave function is a complex function. Let me write it as ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. But wait, I'm not sure if this is correct. Maybe the wave function is a real function multiplied by i or something. Wait, perhaps the wave function is actually (a/sqrt(1+x)) multiplied by an imaginary unit, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the expression is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, meaning a complex function. But I think that the wave function being given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) implies that perhaps I made a mistake in the initial reading. Let me recheck.

Wait, the problem states that the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. Hmm, that's a bit unusual because wave functions are usually either real or have both real and imaginary parts, but the presence of i suggests it's complex. But in quantum mechanics, the wave function must be square-integrable and normalizable, and the normalization condition is the integral of |ψ|^2 dx equals 1.

So, let's proceed. The wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, but only between x=1 and x=3. Wait, but wait, that's a bit confusing. Because if x is between 1 and 3, then 1+x ranges from 2 to 4, so sqrt(1+x) is between sqrt(2) and 2. So a is a normalization constant. But I'm not sure I'm following correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is entirely real, and the problem has a typo. Wait, perhaps the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by some function, or perhaps the wave function is given as a complex function. Let me try to think more clearly.

Wait, maybe the wave function is given as a real function. Let me look again. The problem says the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So it's a complex function. Hmm, but this seems a bit off because a wave function being partially imaginary might complicate normalization, unless the real and imaginary parts are both non-zero. But perhaps I should proceed.

Wait, perhaps the wave function is written as (a / sqrt(1+x)) multiplied by some exponential or something else, but perhaps the given expression is correct as is. Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) for x between 1 and 3, and zero otherwise. But the problem says that when they measured, none were found outside x=1 and x=3, so the wave function is zero elsewhere. So the wave function is non-zero only from x=1 to x=3, and zero elsewhere.

So, the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, for 1 ≤ x ≤ 3, and zero otherwise. Wait, that would make the wave function have both real and imaginary parts in that interval. But that's a bit odd because typically, the wave functions for particles in a box or similar problems are real, but perhaps in this case, it's more general.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the problem. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, is the entire term multiplied by i? Or is it a real function minus 0.5i? Let me read the question again.

The problem states: "the wave function of each particle, in a part of space where it can exist, can be described as: (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5*i; where “i” is the square root of -1, and “sqrt()” means the square root of."

Oh, wait, perhaps the correct reading is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by (1 - 0.5i). But the way it's written as (a / sqrt(...)) - 0.5i suggests that it's a real part and an imaginary part. So ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i.

Wait, that would imply that the wave function has a real part (a/sqrt(1+x)) and an imaginary part (-0.5). But that's a bit strange because the wave function is a function of x, so the real and imaginary parts should also be functions of x. Oh wait, no, I think perhaps the expression is written as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by a complex constant, but the way it's written is (a / sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i. That would imply that the real part is a function of x, and the imaginary part is a constant. That seems odd because the wave function should depend on x in both real and imaginary parts. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the notation.

Wait, perhaps the wave function is written as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by an imaginary unit, so ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) * i. But that would make the wave function purely imaginary, which is acceptable, because the square of its absolute value would be positive. But that's not what the problem says. The problem says (a/sqrt(...)) minus 0.5i, which suggests real and imaginary parts.

Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by e^{-i something}, but that's speculative. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is purely real, and the question has a typo, but given the options, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) for x between 1 and 3, and zero elsewhere, because the presence of i complicates things and perhaps the problem intended a real function.

Wait, if the wave function is purely real, then ψ(x) = a / sqrt(1 + x) for x between 1 and 3, and zero otherwise. That's an easier scenario to handle. Let me proceed under that assumption. Because if it's a complex function, the normalization would involve integrating the real and imaginary parts, but perhaps the problem expects me to think it's real.

Wait, but the problem states that the wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me think again. The wave function is a function that's defined as (a/sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i, but only in the region where the particle exists (x between 1 and 3). So, perhaps the wave function is ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i for 1 ≤ x ≤ 3, and zero elsewhere.

Wait, that would mean that the wave function has a real part (a/sqrt(1+x)) and an imaginary part (-0.5) in the region 1 ≤ x ≤ 3, and zero in other regions. But that seems odd because the imaginary part is a constant, not a function of x. So perhaps that's not correct. Perhaps there's a misinterpretation in the problem statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the entire expression is multiplied by i, making it an imaginary function. So ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5) * i. That would make the wave function purely imaginary, which is acceptable because the absolute square would be real.

But regardless, the normalization condition is the integral of |ψ(x)|^2 dx from x=1 to x=3 equals 1. So perhaps I should proceed with the wave function as given, even if it's a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps the wave function is written as ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, but I think that's incorrect because the presence of i suggests it's a complex number, but the problem is giving a wave function that's a function of x. So perhaps I should proceed by assuming that the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) in the region x=1 to x=3, and zero elsewhere. Because that's more manageable.

So, let's proceed with that assumption. Then, the wave function is ψ(x) = a / sqrt(1 + x) for x between 1 and 3, and zero otherwise.

To find 'a', I need to normalize the wave function. The normalization condition is the integral of |ψ(x)|^2 dx from 1 to 3 equals 1.

Since ψ(x) is real here, |ψ(x)|^2 is just [a^2 / (1 + x)]. So the integral becomes:

Integral from x=1 to x=3 of [a^2 / (1 + x)] dx = 1.

Let me compute this integral.

Let me make a substitution: u = 1 + x. Then, du = dx. When x=1, u=2; when x=3, u=4.

So the integral becomes a^2 * ∫ (1/u) du from u=2 to u=4.

The integral of 1/u du is ln|u|, so evaluating from 2 to 4 gives ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So the integral is a^2 * ln(2) = 1.

So a^2 = 1 / ln(2).

Taking the square root, a = 1 / sqrt(ln(2)).

Compute sqrt(ln(2)): ln(2) is approximately 0.6931, so sqrt(0.6931) ≈ 0.8325.

Thus, a ≈ 1 / 0.8325 ≈ 1.201.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are:

A) 1.1

B) 0.85

C) 0.35

D) 0.6

Hmm, 1.2 is close to option A (1.1), but not exact. So perhaps my assumption about the wave function being real is incorrect. Let me reconsider.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the wave function expression. The problem gives ψ(x) as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So the wave function is a complex function. Let me recompute the normalization considering that.

So ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Therefore, ψ*(x) (the complex conjugate) is (a / sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i.

The absolute square is ψ*(x) ψ(x) = [ (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 ] + [ (a/sqrt(1+x)) * (0.5i) * i ] * ... Wait, no, more accurately, the product is (a/sqrt(1+x) -0.5i) * (a/sqrt(1+x) +0.5i ). This is equal to (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2, because the cross terms are (a/sqrt(1+x))*0.5i * (-a/sqrt(1+x))*(-0.5i) etc. Wait, no, let me compute it properly.

Actually, when you multiply (a - bi)(a + bi) you get a^2 + b^2. So in this case, a is (a/sqrt(1+x)), and b is 0.5.

So |ψ(x)|^2 = (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2 = (a^2)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, but that can't be right because the integral would then include both terms. So the normalization integral would be the integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a^2)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx equals 1.

Wait, but this seems a bit more complicated, but let's proceed.

So, the integral is ∫ [a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx from 1 to 3.

Let's compute each part separately.

The first term: a² ∫ dx/(1+x) from 1 to 3. As before, substitution u=1+x, du=dx. Limits from 2 to 4. So integral is a² ln(4/2) = a² ln(2).

The second term: 0.25 ∫ dx from 1 to 3. That's 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2 = 0.5.

So the total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute that: ln(2) ≈ 0.6931 → 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7209. Then a = sqrt(0.7209) ≈ 0.849, approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So that would be the answer.

But wait, earlier when I assumed the wave function was real, I got a value around 1.2, which isn't an option. But when considering the wave function is complex, I get a value around 0.85, which is option B.

So the correct approach is to include both terms in the absolute square, leading to a value of a approximately 0.85. So the answer should be option B.

To determine the normalization constant \( a \), we start with the given wave function:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i, \quad 1 \leq x \leq 3.
\]

The wave function is zero outside this interval. The normalization condition requires:

\[
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1.
\]

Since \( \psi(x) \) is zero outside \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \), the integral simplifies to:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1.
\]

The absolute square of \( \psi(x) \) is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left( \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \right) \left( \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} + 0.5i \right).
\]

Expanding this product:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left( \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} \right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

Substituting this into the normalization condition:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left( \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25 \right) dx = 1.
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

\[
a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx + 0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx = 1.
\]

### First Term: \( a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx \)
Using the substitution \( u = 1+x \), \( du = dx \), the limits change from \( x=1 \) (\( u=2 \)) to \( x=3 \) (\( u=4 \)):

\[
a^2 \int_{2}^{4} \frac{1}{u} du = a^2 \ln(u) \Big|_{2}^{4} = a^2 \ln(4) - a^2 \ln(2) = a^2 \ln(2).
\]

### Second Term: \( 0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx \)
\[
0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx = 0.25 (3 - 1) = 0.5.
\]

### Combining Both Terms
The normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7209 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7209} \approx 0.85.
\]

### Final Answer
The numerical value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Since ψ(x) is real here, |ψ(x)|^2 is just [a^2 / (1 + x)]. So the integral becomes:

Integral from x=1 to x=3 of [a^2 / (1 + x)] dx = 1.

Let me compute this integral.

Let me make a substitution: u = 1 + x. Then, du = dx. When x=1, u=2; when x=3, u=4.

So the integral becomes a^2 * ∫ (1/u) du from u=2 to u=4.

The integral of 1/u du is ln|u|, so evaluating from 2 to 4 gives ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So the integral is a^2 * ln(2) = 1.

So a^2 = 1 / ln(2).

Taking the square root, a = 1 / sqrt(ln(2)).

Compute sqrt(ln(2)): ln(2) is approximately 0.6931, so sqrt(0.6931) ≈ 0.8325.

Thus, a ≈ 1 / 0.8325 ≈ 1.201.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are:

A) 1.1

B) 0.85

C) 0.35

D) 0.6

Hmm, 1.2 is close to option A (1.1), but not exact. So perhaps my assumption about the wave function being real is incorrect. Let me reconsider.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the wave function expression. The problem gives ψ(x) as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So the wave function is a complex function. Let me recompute the normalization considering that.

So ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Therefore, ψ*(x) (the complex conjugate) is (a / sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i.

The absolute square is ψ*(x) ψ(x) = [ (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 ] + [ (a/sqrt(1+x)) * (0.5i) * i ] * ... Wait, no, more accurately, the product is (a/sqrt(1+x) -0.5i) * (a/sqrt(1+x) +0.5i ). This is equal to (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2, because the cross terms are (a/sqrt(1+x))*0.5i * (-a/sqrt(1+x))*(-0.5i) etc. Wait, no, let me compute it properly.

Actually, when you multiply (a - bi)(a + bi) you get a^2 + b^2. So in this case, a is (a/sqrt(1+x)), and b is 0.5.

So |ψ(x)|^2 = (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2 = (a^2)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, but that can't be right because the integral would then include both terms. So the normalization integral would be the integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a^2)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx equals 1.

Wait, but this seems a bit more complicated, but let's proceed.

So, the integral is ∫ [a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx from 1 to 3.

Let's compute each part separately.

The first term: a² ∫ dx/(1+x) from 1 to 3. As before, substitution u=1+x, du=dx. Limits from 2 to 4. So integral is a² ln(4/2) = a² ln(2).

The second term: 0.25 ∫ dx from 1 to 3. That's 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2 = 0.5.

So the total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute that: ln(2) ≈ 0.6931 → 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7209. Then a = sqrt(0.7209) ≈ 0.849, approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So that would be the answer.

But wait, earlier when I assumed the wave function was real, I got a value around 1.2, which isn't an option. But when considering the wave function is complex, I get a value around 0.85, which is option B.

So the correct approach is to include both terms in the absolute square, leading to a value of a approximately 0.85. So the answer should be option B.


To determine the normalization constant \( a \), we start with the given wave function:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i, \quad 1 \leq x \leq 3.
\]

The wave function is zero outside this interval. The normalization condition requires:

\[
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1.
\]

Since \( \psi(x) \) is zero outside \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \), the integral simplifies to:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1.
\]

The absolute square of \( \psi(x) \) is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left( \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \right) \left( \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} + 0.5i \right).
\]

Expanding this product:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left( \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} \right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

Substituting this into the normalization condition:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left( \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25 \right) dx = 1.
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

\[
a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx + 0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx = 1.
\]

### First Term: \( a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx \)
Using the substitution \( u = 1+x \), \( du = dx \), the limits change from \( x=1 \) (\( u=2 \)) to \( x=3 \) (\( u=4 \)):

\[
a^2 \int_{2}^{4} \frac{1}{u} du = a^2 \ln(u) \Big|_{2}^{4} = a^2 \ln(4) - a^2 \ln(2) = a^2 \ln(2).
\]

### Second Term: \( 0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx \)
\[
0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx = 0.25 (3 - 1) = 0.5.
\]

### Combining Both Terms
The normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7209 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7209} \approx 0.85.
\]

### Final Answer
The numerical value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.
