Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let me read through it again and try to break it down.

The question is about a reaction involving Substance X. X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The precipitate formed is G, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is near 277 K. Also, a certain keto acid reacting with X produces a product with two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially a very close analog of it.

I need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. The options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

Hmm, let's start by identifying what X, Y, W, G, and B could be.

First, the reaction between X and Y. Violent reaction suggests it's a strong acid-base reaction or maybe a redox reaction. Let me think about common violent reactions. For example, metals reacting with acids can be violent, but that usually produces H2 gas. Alternatively, perhaps it's a reaction involving a carbonate and acid, which would release CO2, but that's not as violent. Wait, another possibility: maybe X is a metal and Y is water, but that doesn't quite fit. Alternatively, maybe Y is a liquid like liquid nitrogen or something else, but that seems less likely.

Wait, the gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. That's an important clue. Let's think about possible gases. The most common gases are O2, N2, H2, etc. But for W, the molecule must have equal number of neutrons and protons.

Wait, the molecule of W: each molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. Let's think about the isotopes. For example, H2 (hydrogen gas): each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So each molecule has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. But that's not equal. Another option: O2. O is atomic number 8, so each O has 8 protons. If the isotope is O-16, which has 8 neutrons. So each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons, but the molecule as a whole would have 32 protons and 32 neutrons? No, wait, each molecule is O2, which is two O atoms. So each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (for O-16). So the molecule has 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So yes, same number. So gas W could be O2, but that's a gas under standard conditions, but if Y is a liquid, maybe it's a reaction that produces O2.

Wait, another option: maybe it's CH4? No, because that's a gas but the molecule would have 6 protons (C has 6, H each has 1, total 6+4=10 protons?), but neutrons would vary based on isotopes. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's CO2? Each molecule has 12 (C) + 16 (O) = but the molecule's protons? Let me see: C has 6 protons, O has 8, so CO2 has 6 + 2*8=22 protons. Neutrons? C is usually 6 (if C-12), O is 8 (O-16). So CO2 would have 6 + 2*8 = 6+16=22 neutrons. So 22 protons and 22 neutrons. That fits. But wait, under standard conditions, CO2 is a gas? No, it's a gas at STP, so that's possible. Alternatively, maybe it's another gas like N2: each N has 7 protons and 7 neutrons (N-14). So N2 would have 14 protons and 14 neutrons. So same number. So that's another possibility.

Wait, but the melting point of B is near 277 K. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius (since 273 K is 0 C, so 277 is about 4 C). So what solid has a melting point near that? Water? No, water's melting point is 0 C. Maybe something else. Wait, another thought: perhaps B is a base, like NaOH? But that's solid, but I'm not sure about its melting point. Alternatively, maybe B is a metal oxide. Wait, perhaps B is a hydroxide. Alternatively, let me think about what's produced when a carbonate reacts with an acid. If Y is an acid, and X is a carbonate, then reaction would release CO2 gas. Let me think: if X is a carbonate, say Na2CO3, and Y is H2SO4, then reaction produces CO2, water, and Na2SO4. The precipitate G? Hmm, if Y is sulfuric acid, and X is a carbonate, then the precipitate might be something else. Alternatively, perhaps X is a sulfide, reacting with an acid to produce H2S gas. But H2S has 2 protons (each H has 1, S has 16?), wait no. H2S has 2 H (each with 1 proton) and one S (16 protons). So total protons per molecule is 18. Neutrons: each H has 0, S is 32 (since S is atomic number 16, so S-32 has 16 neutrons). So H2S would have 18 protons and 32 neutrons. Not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe W is CO2. So for CO2, each molecule has 6 (from C) + 2*8 (from O) = 22 protons. The neutrons: C-12 is 6 neutrons, O-16 is 8 each. So 6 + 2*8 = 22 neutrons. So 22 protons and 22 neutrons. So W is CO2.

So if X reacts with Y (say, acid) to produce CO2, then X is probably a carbonate. But then, the precipitate G could be a metal hydroxide if the acid is strong. Wait, but wait in the reaction, when a carbonate reacts with a strong acid, it produces CO2, water, and the corresponding salt. For example, CaCO3 + H2SO4 → CaSO4 + CO2↑ + H2O. CaSO4 is soluble, so maybe it wouldn't precipitate. Alternatively, if X is a sulfite, reacting with acid would produce SO2 gas. But SO2 has 16 (S) + 2*8 (O) = 30 protons, and 16+2*8=30 neutrons if S is 32 (so 16 neutrons). Wait, that would make 30 protons and (32-16=16 for S) + 2*(8) for O (each O is 8, so 16). Wait, no: each O in SO2 is 8 protons, but the isotopes would determine the neutrons. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps W is O2. Let's think about that. O2 has each O atom with 8 protons and 8 neutrons (O-16). So O2 has 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So that fits the same number.

So if W is O2, then the reaction between X and Y produces O2 gas. What reaction produces O2? Maybe a decomposition reaction. For example, if X is a peroxide, like H2O2. But when peroxide decomposes, it produces O2. But the reaction would need a catalyst. Also, if Y is a liquid, perhaps H2O2 (as Y) reacting with another substance to produce O2. Alternatively, maybe X is a metal oxide reacting with an acid to produce O2? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a chlorate or some other compound that decomposes to produce O2. For example, KClO3 decomposes when heated with MnO2 catalyst to produce KCl and O2. But the reaction is 2 KClO3 → 2 KCl + 3 O2↑. However, the problem says X reacts with Y, so perhaps Y is a catalyst or a reactant.

Wait, but the problem says X reacts with Y, producing W as gas, and G as precipitate. Then when G is heated, it releases B. So let's think about the sequence.

Another angle: the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Keto acids are like acetic acid, which is a carboxylic acid (CH3COOH). If X reacts with a keto acid and the product has two oxygen atoms, perhaps X is something that adds to the acid, like a base. For instance, a base neutralizing the acid to form a salt and water. But then the product would have more oxygens. Alternatively, maybe X is a metal, and the keto acid is acting as an acid, so the product could be a metal salt. If the product has two oxygen atoms, perhaps it's something like Na2CO3 (but that's three oxygens). Hmm, maybe the product is a metal acetate, which would have more oxygens.

Wait, perhaps the product is something like NaHCO3? No, that's a different scenario.

Wait, the product of a keto acid and X contains two oxygen atoms. Let's think about possible products. Maybe it's a salt with the formula M(OH)2, but that would have OH groups. Alternatively, maybe the product is a diatomic molecule, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a metal oxide where the metal forms a compound with two oxygen atoms. For example, MgO. MgO has one Mg and one O. So that would have one O atom. But the product has two O atoms. So maybe CaO? No, that's one O. Wait, perhaps the product is a carbonate, but again, that's three O atoms.

Wait, maybe the product is a metal bicarbonate, like NaHCO3, but that has three O's. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a sulfate, like MgSO4, which has four O's. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the product is a molecule like CO2, but that's from the earlier part. Alternatively, maybe the product is something like a ketone? No, because the keto acid is reacting, perhaps it's esterification, but that would require an alcohol.

Wait, perhaps this is a Grignard reaction. If X is an organomagnesium compound, like MgBr2, which reacts with a keto acid (like a ketone acid, but more likely a carboxylic acid) to form a salt, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps X is a base that deprotonates the acid, forming a salt. For example, if X is NaOH, reacting with acetic acid would form Na acetate and water. Sodium acetate has the formula CH3COONa, which contains two oxygen atoms in the acetate ion. Wait, no, the acetate ion is CH3COO^-, which has two oxygen atoms. So perhaps the product is sodium acetate, which has two O's in the acetate. So that would fit the condition.

If that's the case, then X could be NaOH. Because NaOH (a base) reacts with a keto acid (like acetic acid) to form sodium acetate and water. Sodium acetate has two O's in the acetate part (but overall, the formula is CH3COONa, which has two O's in the acetate and one O in the hydroxide? No, wait: CH3COOH (acetic acid) is CH3COOH, and NaOH would deprotonate it to form CH3COO^- Na^+ and water. So the product is CH3COONa, which has two O's in the acetate group (but the molecule as a whole has more O's). Wait, the product would have more than two O's, but perhaps the question refers to the number of O atoms in the molecule, like two O's in the product. Hmm, but the product would have more. I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe the product is something like CO2, which has two O's, but that comes from the reaction of X and Y, not the keto acid.

Wait, perhaps the reaction of the keto acid with X produces a compound with two O atoms, not the overall product. Like, perhaps X is a diatomic molecule that adds two O's.

Wait, perhaps X is O2, but that's a gas. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal, and the reaction with the keto acid (say, HCOOH, formic acid) produces a metal formate. For example, if X is Na, then Na + HCOOH → NaHCOO (sodium formate) and H2. But sodium formate has two O's in the formate ion (HCOO^-). So the product would have two O's. That fits. So in this case, X would be Na.

Wait, but the initial part of the question says that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So if X is Na, the heavier isotope would be Na-23 (the most common is Na-23, but the heavier one would be Na-25 or Na-24? Wait, natural Na is mostly Na-23 (~100%). So perhaps X is something else.

Wait, perhaps X is Cl. So when Cl reacts with H2O, it produces HClO, HCl, etc., but that's more about hypochlorous acid. Alternatively, Cl2 reacting with water produces HClO and HCl. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe X is a metal like Mg. Mg reacts with acids to produce H2 gas. But earlier we thought W could be O2, but that's conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an isotope-rich substance. For example, if X is a metal with a heavier isotope, like if it's a metal like sulfur where one of its isotopes is heavier.

Wait, let's go back to the precipitate G. When X reacts with Y, G is formed, and when G is heated, it releases B. So G is a precipitate, perhaps a hydroxide or carbonate. Heating it would release B, which has a melting point near 277 K.

Wait, 277 K is about 4°C. What solid has a melting point around that? Water is 273 K (0°C). Maybe something like NaOH? Wait, no, NaOH is a solid, but it's more about its melting point. Alternatively, maybe B is a hydrate that releases water when heated. Alternatively, perhaps B is a basic carbonate.

Wait, another thought: if G is a metal carbonate, and when heated, it decomposes into a metal oxide and CO2. For example, CaCO3 → CaO + CO2 when heated. So B would be CaO. What's the melting point of CaO? I think it's around 2615°C, which is way higher than 277 K. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a metal hydroxide. When a carbonate is heated, perhaps it decomposes. But I'm not exactly certain.

Wait, let me think about the initial reaction. X reacts violently with Y to release W, a gas. If X is a carbonate (like Na2CO3), and Y is a strong acid (like H2SO4), then the reaction would produce CO2 gas. So W would be CO2, which as we considered earlier, fits the condition of having same number of protons and neutrons (22 each).

So if X is Na2CO3, then Y is H2SO4. The reaction would be: Na2CO3 + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + CO2↑ + H2O. But Na2SO4 is soluble, so it wouldn't form a precipitate. So this doesn't fit because G is a precipitate.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a sulfide. For example, ZnS reacting with HCl would produce H2S gas. But earlier, H2S doesn't fit the W condition because protons and neutrons aren't equal. Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonate, but Y is a weak acid.

Wait, another thought: maybe Y is water, but that would produce a basic solution. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal oxide. For example, when a metal oxide reacts with an acid, it produces water and a salt. But that wouldn't produce a gas unless it's a carbonate or another compound that releases gas upon reaction.

Wait, another angle: the product of a keto acid and X has two oxygen atoms. Let's think about this. If the product is a salt where the anion has two oxygen atoms, like CO3^2- (but that's three O's), or maybe SO4^2- (four O's). Alternatively, maybe the product is a metal oxide with two O's. Like MgO, which has one O. Hmm, perhaps the product is a carbonate with two O's? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone, but that's a stretch. Alternatively, maybe the product is a carbonyl compound. Wait, perhaps X is a reducing agent that converts the keto acid into something else. For example, converting a carboxylic acid into a ketone via reduction. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal, and the keto acid is a carboxylic acid. So the reaction is a neutralization, forming a salt and water. For example, Mg(OH)2 reacting with acetic acid to form Mg(OH)CH3COO and water. Wait, that seems unlikely.

Wait, maybe the product is a carbonate. For example, X is sodium (Na), which reacts with carbon dioxide (maybe in the presence of water) to form sodium bicarbonate. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a metal oxide with two oxygen atoms. For example, CaO has one O, but perhaps something else. Wait, perhaps it's not about the number of O atoms in the molecule but the total in the product. For instance, if the product is H2O, which has one O, but that's not two. Alternatively, maybe it's something like HCOOH (formic acid), but that's the starting material.

Wait, maybe the reaction is between X and the keto acid to form CO2. So if the keto acid is something like CH3COOH (acetic acid), and X is something that can oxidize it to CO2. But that's more about combustion, which is a different scenario.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to approach it step by step.

First, identify W. It's a gas with the same number of protons and neutrons in its molecule. As discussed, CO2 and O2 are possibilities.

If W is O2, what produces O2? Decomposition of peroxides or chlorates, perhaps. For example, H2O2 → O2 + H2O. But in that case, X would be H2O2 and Y would be a catalyst like MnO2. But the problem states that X reacts with Y, so perhaps X is H2O2 and Y is MnO2, a catalyst. But then, what would be the precipitate G? MnO2 is a catalyst and wouldn't precipitate. Alternatively, perhaps X is KClO3 and Y is MnO2 and heat, but that's more about decomposition upon heating.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonate and Y is an acid, producing CO2. Let's go with that for now.

So W is CO2. So in this case, X is a carbonate, Y is an acid.

The precipitate G would be the salt formed. For example, if X is CaCO3 and Y is H2SO4, the reaction is CaCO3 + H2SO4 → CaSO4 + CO2↑ + H2O. CaSO4 is sparingly soluble, but if it's a strong acid, maybe it's soluble. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a weak acid, and the salt is insoluble. For instance, if X is Ag2CO3 (silver carbonate) and Y is HNO3, the reaction would produce AgNO3, which is soluble, and CO2. Hmm, but that wouldn't form a precipitate.

Wait, perhaps X is a sulfide, like FeS, and Y is HCl. The reaction would produce H2S gas. But earlier analysis shows H2S doesn't fit the W condition.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a nitride, like Mg3N2, reacting with water to produce NH3 gas. NH3 has 14 protons (1 from N and 3 from H?), no, wait: N has 7 protons, each H has 1. So NH3 has 7 + 3(1) = 10 protons. Neutrons: N is usually 14 (so 7 neutrons), H has 0. So each molecule has 10 protons and 7 neutrons. Doesn't fit. So W can't be NH3.

Hmm, perhaps W is O2. Then, X and Y could be H2O2 and MnO2. But what precipitate would form from that reaction? H2O2 decomposes to O2 and H2O, but that doesn't produce a precipitate.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a chlorate, and Y is a reducing agent, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps W is N2. Each N atom has 7 protons and 7 neutrons if it's N-14. So N2 would have 14 protons and 14 neutrons. So that fits. What reaction produces N2? Maybe decomposition of ammonium chloride, but that would produce NH3 and HCl, which doesn't fit. Alternatively, the Haber process, but that's not a reaction here.

Alternatively, perhaps W is CH4, but that's a stretch because CH4 has 6 protons (C is 6, each H is 1). So 6 +4=10 protons. Neutrons: C is 12 (6 neutrons), each H is 1 (0 neutrons). So 6 +4*0=6. So 10 protons and 6 neutrons, which doesn't match.

Another possibility: W is H2O. Each H has 1 proton, O has 8. So H2O has 2+8=10 protons. Neutrons: H has 0, O has 8 (for O-16). So 8 neutrons. 10 protons and 8 neutrons don't match.

Wait, perhaps W is C2H2 (acetylene). But that's a stretch. Let's think: C has 6, H has 1 each. So 2 C's = 12 protons, 2 H's=2. Total 14 protons. Neutrons: C is 12 (6 each), H is 1 (0). So 2 C's = 12, 2 H's=0. So 12 neutrons. 14 protons vs 12 neutrons—doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps W is He. Helium is a noble gas, but each He atom has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (He-4). So a He molecule would be He2? Or monoatomic. If it's monoatomic, each He has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. So for a molecule (which would be He), same number. So that could fit. But He is a gas, but the reaction between X and Y would have to produce He. That seems unlikely under normal conditions unless it's a nuclear reaction, which is not the case here.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the reaction again.

Substance X reacts violently with Y to produce gas W, precipitate G. G, when heated, releases B. B's melting point is near 277 K.

Wait, 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. So B is a solid at room temperature but melts just above 0C. Water is 0C, but maybe something else. What about NaOH? No, NaOH is solid but has a higher melting point. Maybe something like ammonium chloride? No, that sublimes. Alternatively, perhaps B is a hydrate. For example, sodium carbonate decahydrate? No, that's a crystalline solid.

Wait, another thought: B could be a basic carbonate. For example, when a carbonate is heated, it might decompose. But I'm not getting anywhere with this.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a metal oxide. For example, if G is a hydroxide, which upon heating decomposes to the oxide and water. For example, Cu(OH)2 → CuO + H2O when heated. CuO has a melting point of around 2265°C, which is way higher than 277 K.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a hydrate that releases water upon heating. For example, sodium carbonate decahydrate loses water when heated, but that doesn't produce a new compound; it just becomes an anhydrous salt.

Wait, perhaps B is a metal bicarbonate. For example, sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) decomposes when heated to produce Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. But the melting point of NaHCO3 is around 270°C, which is higher than 277 K (which is about 4°C). So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps B is a different compound. If W is CO2, then perhaps the reaction is a carbonate decomposing into CO2 and the oxide. For example, CaCO3 → CaO + CO2 upon heating. CaO has a melting point of about 2615°C, which is way higher than 277 K. So no.

Wait, perhaps B is something like ice. But ice melts at 273 K, which is 0°C. The problem says B's melting point is close to 277 K, which is 4°C. So perhaps B is a compound that's close to ice's melting point. Maybe something like potassium carbonate? Or perhaps some other hydrate.

Alternatively, maybe B is a different form of water, like ice. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the initial reaction again. X reacts with Y to produce W, G. Then G is heated to release B. So G is a precipitate, which upon heating gives B. If G is a carbonate, heating it would release CO2, but the oxide would remain. So B would be the oxide.

Wait, but if X is a carbonate, Y is an acid, then G would be the salt. If the salt is insoluble, it precipitates. For example, if X is Ag2CO3 and Y is HNO3, the reaction would produce AgNO3 (soluble), CO2, and H2O. But AgNO3 is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal hydroxide, and Y is an acid. The reaction would produce a salt and water. If the salt is insoluble, it precipitates. For example, if X is Fe(OH)3 and Y is HCl, the reaction produces FeCl3 (which is soluble) and water. So that wouldn't form a precipitate.

Wait, perhaps X is a sulfide, and Y is an acid. For example, FeS + HCl → FeCl2 + H2S↑. But H2S doesn't fit W's condition.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a nitride. For example, Mg3N2 + H2O → Mg(OH)2 + NH3↑. But NH3 doesn't fit W's condition.

Hmm, this is getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about the other clues.

Substance X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially a very close analog. What are common reagents in organic chemistry? Maybe something like NaOH, which is used in saponification, or Grignard reagents (like Mg), or maybe something like KMnO4 or others.

Wait, Grignard reagents are organomagnesium compounds. They react with ketones, esters, etc., to form alkanes, alcohols, etc. So maybe X is a Grignard reagent, like MgBr2. But Grignard reagents are typically RMgX, where R is an alkyl or aryl group.

Wait, the product of a keto acid and X has two O atoms. Hmm, if X is a Grignard reagent, maybe it's adding to the keto acid. For example, a Grignard reagent adding to a ketone would form an alcohol. But if the starting material is a keto acid (like a β-keto acid), perhaps the reaction leads to a different product.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent. LAH reduces esters, carboxylic acids, etc., to alcohols. But if X is LAH, then reacting it with a keto acid would produce an alcohol, which doesn't have two O's.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a base like NaOH, used in saponification. But in that case, the product would be a soap (a carboxylate salt), which has more than two O's.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal like Li. Li reacts with carboxylic acids to form salts. For example, Li + CH3COOH → LiCH3COO + H2↑. The product, LiCH3COO, has two O's in the acetate part. So that fits the condition. So in this case, X would be Li.

Now, considering that Li has a heavier isotope. Lithium has two main isotopes: Li-6 and Li-7. So if X is Li, it incorporates a heavier isotope, probably Li-7.

Now, let's think about the reaction between Li and Y. Y is a liquid, perhaps. If Y is water, Li reacts violently with water to produce H2 gas. So W would be H2. Does H2 fit the condition? Each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So each molecule has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. So protons (2) ≠ neutrons (0), so H2 doesn't fit. So that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is another liquid, like liquid ammonia. But Li reacts with NH3 to form LiNH2 and H2. So W is H2 again, which doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe X is not Li, but another metal. Let's think about Mg. Mg reacts with water (if it's H2O, but not violently unless in specific conditions). Alternatively, Mg reacts with acids to produce H2. So W would be H2, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonate, and Y is an acid. Then W is CO2, which fits. Let's say X is Na2CO3. Then, when it reacts with Y (an acid like H2SO4), W is CO2, which fits the condition.

But then, the precipitate G would be the salt. If Y is a strong acid, the salt would be soluble, but if Y is a weak acid, the salt might be insoluble. For example, if X is CaCO3 and Y is CH3COOH (acetic acid), the reaction may not proceed because CaCO3 is not very reactive with weak acids. But if it does, it would produce Ca(CH3COO)2, which is soluble. So no precipitate. So this doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a nitrate. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the product of the reaction of a keto acid with X contains two oxygen atoms. If X is a metal, and the product is a metal bicarbonate, like NaHCO3, which has three O's (in the bicarbonate ion). Doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the product is a carbonyl compound. For example, if X is a reducing agent like H2 (but that's a gas). Alternatively, perhaps X is a transition metal that forms a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a diatomic molecule like O2. But then, how would it react with a keto acid?

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone. For example, if X is a base that deprotonates a keto acid to form a ketone. But that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an ester. For example, if X is an alcohol, and the keto acid is a carboxylic acid, they could esterify to form an ester. But then, the product would have more O's.

This is getting a bit too tangled. Let me try to think about the elements in X.

Substance X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Common reagents include NaOH, Mg (for Grignard), Li (for organolithium reagents), KMnO4, etc.

Given that X and its analog are used as reagents, perhaps X is Mg. Because magnesium is used in Grignard reagents. So X could be Mg.

But Mg reacts with acids to produce H2. So W would be H2, which doesn't fit the condition.

Wait, perhaps X is a heavier isotope of Mg. So Mg has two main isotopes: Mg-24 (79%), Mg-25 (11%), Mg-26 (10%). So the heavier isotopes are Mg-25 and Mg-26.

If X is Mg, then when it reacts with an acid (Y), it produces H2 gas. But H2 doesn't fit W's condition, so that can't be.

Wait, another angle: the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X contains two oxygen atoms. So perhaps the product is a compound like CH3COO^- X^+ with two O's in the acetate.

Wait, if X is Na, then Na reacts with acetic acid to form sodium acetate (CH3COONa), which has two O's in the acetate ion. So that fits the condition.

So X could be Na. Now, considering that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Sodium has isotopes: Na-23 (100% natural abundance), Na-24 (trace), Na-25 (trace), Na-26 (trace). So the heavier isotopes would be Na-24, 25, 26. But since Na-23 is the main isotope, perhaps X is a compound where Na is present in a heavier isotope form, like Na-25.

Now, the reaction between X (Na) and Y (liquid) produces W gas. If Y is water, Na reacts violently with water to produce NaOH, H2 gas, and heat. So W is H2, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if Y is a liquid acid like H2SO4, but Na reacts with it to produce H2 and Na2SO4. Again, W is H2, which doesn't fit.

Hmm, this isn't working. Let me think about the initial reaction again. X reacts with Y to produce gas W. W's molecule has same protons and neutrons. Let's think of another gas that fits this condition.

Wait, CO (carbon monoxide) has 6 protons (C) + 8 (O) = 14 protons. Neutrons: C has 6 (if C-12), O has 8 (if O-16). So 6 +8=14 neutrons. So CO has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. That fits the condition.

So W could be CO. What reactions produce CO? The reduction of CO2, perhaps. For example, in the presence of a catalyst, CH4 + CO2 → 2 CO + 2 H2.

But I'm not sure how that relates to X and Y.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonate and Y is a reducing agent, like carbon (solid), leading to CO and CO2. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another reaction: when a metal reacts with a carbonate in the presence of a reducing agent, perhaps CO is produced. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal oxide, and Y is a carbonate, leading to a reaction that produces CO.

But I'm not making progress on this front.

Let me think about B again. If B's melting point is about 277 K, which is about 4°C. So B is a solid at room temperature, melting just above 0°C. What compounds fit this? Perhaps something like ammonium chloride, but that sublimes. Or maybe a hydrated salt like MgSO4·7H2O, which has a melting point around 33°C. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a hydrate that releases water upon heating. When heated, G (the precipitate) releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K. So G could be a carbonate, which upon heating releases CO2 and forms an oxide.

Wait, perhaps G is a basic carbonate, like CuCO3·Cu(OH)2, which upon heating decomposes into CuO, CO2, and H2O. But the resulting B would be CuO, which has a much higher melting point.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a basic sulfate, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps G is a carbonate that upon heating releases B, which is the oxide. For example, if G is Na2CO3·H2O (a decahydrate?), which upon heating gives Na2CO3 (anhydrous) and water. But Na2CO3 has a melting point around 854°C, which doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a bicarbonate. For example, NaHCO3 decomposes upon heating to Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. But NaHCO3's melting point is around 270°C, which is much higher than 277 K.

Wait, perhaps B is something like sodium formate (HCOONa), which has a melting point near 277 K. Let me check: Sodium formate's melting point is around 230°C, which is higher than 277 K (4°C). Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a different compound. Maybe something like sodium acetate? Sodium acetate's melting point is around 324°C, which is way higher than 277 K.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me try to think of another approach.

The question is about the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. The options are 35, 25, 31, 29.

If X is a metal, like Mg, the elements are Mg, and perhaps the isotopes are Mg-24, Mg-25, Mg-26. So the lightest is Mg-24 (atomic mass ~24), and the heaviest Mg-26 (atomic mass ~26). So cumulative would be 24 +26 =50. Not matching the options.

If X is Na, the isotopes are Na-23, Na-24, Na-25. So lightest Na-23 (23), heaviest Na-25 (25). Sum is 23+25=48. Not in the options.

If X is Cl, but Cl is diatomic, so perhaps X is Cl2. Cl has isotopes Cl-35 and Cl-37. So lightest is 35, heaviest 37. Sum is 72. Not matching options.

If X is O, but O is O2. O isotopes include O-16, O-17, O-18. So lightest 16, heaviest 18. Sum 34. Not matching.

Wait, wait, the options are 25, 29, 31, 35. So perhaps the lightest is 12 (C) and heaviest 24 (Mg). Sum 36. Not matching. Alternatively, if elements are C and O: 12 +16=28. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps the elements are H and O. H has isotopes H-1 and H-2 (deuterium). O has O-16, etc. So lightest is H-1 (1), heaviest O-18 (18). Sum 19. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound like CH3COOH (acetic acid), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the product of X and a keto acid has two O atoms. If X is a metal, and the product is the metal's salt with an anion that has two O's, like the acetate ion. So the product would be CH3COO^- M^+.

So if the product has two O's, then the anion must have two O's. So the anion is CH3COO^-. The metal would be providing the cation.

So for example, if X is Mg, the product would be Mg(CH3COO)2. But that's two O's in each acetate group, so the total O's would be four. But the product contains two O atoms, so perhaps the metal is Na and the product is NaCH3COO (sodium acetate), which has two O's in the acetate ion.

So, for sodium acetate, the formula is CH3COONa. The acetate ion is CH3COO^-, which has two O's. So the product contains two O's in the anion.

So X would be Na. Now, considering that Na has heavier isotopes, like Na-24 and Na-25.

So in X (sodium), the elements present are Na. So the lightest isotope is Na-23 (mass ~23), the heaviest is Na-25 (mass ~25). The cumulative atomic masses would be 23 + 25 = 48. But the options don't have 48. Hmm.

Wait, but wait. The question says: "the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X". So if X is a compound containing multiple elements, we sum the lightest and heaviest elements' atomic masses.

So for example, if X is Na2CO3, the elements are Na, C, O. The lightest element is C (6), the heaviest is O (16). So sum is 6+16=22. Not in the options.

Alternatively, if X is MgCO3, elements are Mg (12), C (6), O (16). Lightest is C (6), heaviest O (16). Sum 22.

Wait, perhaps X is a compound with elements like Cl and another. For example, if X is KClO3, elements are K (19), Cl (35.5), O (16). Lightest is K (19), heaviest Cl (35.5). So sum 19+35.5=54.5. Not matching the options.

Hmm, this is getting tricky. Let me think again about the options. The options are 35,25,31,29.

Wait, 35 is the atomic mass of Cl. 25 is around the mass of Na (23) or Mg (24.3). Wait, 25 is close to Mg's average atomic weight (24.3). So perhaps the sum is 24.3 + something else.

Alternatively, perhaps X contains elements like C and O. C is ~12, O is ~16. Sum 28. Not matching.

Wait, another possibility: the elements in X are Cl and another. So Cl (35.5) and maybe H (1). Sum 35.5 +1≈36.5, which is close to option A (35). But not exact.

Alternatively, if X contains Cl and another heavier element, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is a diatomic molecule like O2. Then the only element is O. So the lightest and heaviest isotopes would be O-16 and O-18. Sum 16 +18=34. Not matching.

Wait, another approach: what if the lightest and heaviest elements in X are H and O? H's mass is 1, O's is 16. Sum 17. Not matching.

Alternatively, if X contains C and H. C is 12, H is 1. Sum 13. No.

Wait, perhaps X is a compound with elements like C and O. For example, CO2. Then elements are C and O. C is 12, O is 16. Sum 28. Not matching.

Hmm, I'm really stuck. Let me try to think of the cumulative masses again.

The options are 25, 29, 31, 35.

Wait, 25 could be 12 (C) +13 (Al) = 25? No, 12+13=25. So if X contains C and Al, the sum would be 25. But why would X be a combination of C and Al?

Alternatively, perhaps the elements are Na (23) and something else. 23 + something=25. So something is 2. But that's H (1) and maybe another element. Not likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the lightest and heaviest elements in X are Na (23) and Cl (35.5). 23+35.5=58.5. Not matching.

Wait, another idea: perhaps X is a mixture of isotopes, like Cl-35 and Cl-37. So the lightest is 35, heaviest 37. So sum is 35 +37=72. Not in options.

Alternatively, if X is Cl, the lightest isotope is Cl-35, the heaviest Cl-37. Sum is 35+37=72. Again, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the elements are C (12) and O (16). Sum 28. Not matching.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps X contains nitrogen (14) and oxygen (16). Sum 30. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps the elements are Mg (24.3) and something else. For example, Mg and Cl. Mg is 24.3, Cl is 35.5. Sum 24.3+35.5=59.8. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the elements are Mg (24) and O (16). Sum 40. Not matching.

Wait, another angle: the product of the reaction of a keto acid with X contains two oxygen atoms. If X is carbon monoxide (CO), and the reaction is with a keto acid, perhaps it forms a compound with two O's. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonyl compound, like ketone, but that's not a reagent in the way described.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a catalyst, like MnO2, which is used in the decomposition of H2O2 to produce O2. But MnO2 is a solid, and the reaction is 2 H2O2 → 2 H2O + O2. So W would be O2.

In this case, X is MnO2, which is a catalyst. But the problem says X is a substance that reacts with Y. Hmm.

Wait, if X is MnO2, Y is H2O2. The reaction produces O2. So W is O2, which fits the condition.

The precipitate G would be... well, in this reaction, MnO2 is a catalyst and doesn't react, so no precipitate. So this doesn't fit.

Hmm. Let me try to think of another approach.

The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. Let's think of possible pairs that sum up to the options.

Option B is 25. 25 could be 12 (C) +13 (Al). Or 24 (Mg) +1 (H) =25. Or 15 (P) +10 (Ne) =25, but Ne is a noble gas and unlikely to be in X.

Option D is 29. 29 could be 14 (N) +15 (O)=29. Or 12 (C) +17 (Cl)=29. Or 24 (Mg) +5 (B)=29. Hmm.

Option C is 31. Possible pairs: 16 (O) +15 (P)=31. Or 14 (N) +17 (Cl)=31. Or 24 (Mg) +7 (N)=31.

Option A is 35. Could be 18 (Ar) +17 (Cl)=35. Or 16 (O) +19 (K)=35.

But I'm not sure which of these makes sense in the context.

Another approach: the substance X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially a very close analog. Common reagents include NaOH, KOH, LiAlH4, etc. Let's think about their compositions.

NaOH contains Na, O, H. The lightest element is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). Sum 24. Not matching options.

LiAlH4 contains Li, Al, H. Lightest H (1), heaviest Al (27). Sum 28. Not matching.

KMnO4 contains K, Mn, O. K is 39, Mn is 55, O is 16. Lightest O (16), heaviest Mn (55). Sum 71. Not matching.

Wait, another reagent is Mg (used in Grignard reagents). Mg's isotopes are 24,25,26. So the sum of lightest and heaviest is 24+26=50. Not matching.

Wait, another reagent is THF (tetrahydrofuran), which is an ether. But THF is an organic solvent, not a reagent per se.

Wait, another reagent is DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide). It contains C, H, S, O. Lightest H (1), heaviest S (32). Sum 33. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps X is a diatomic molecule like Cl2. Cl has isotopes Cl-35 and Cl-37. So sum is 35+37=72. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound with elements like C and H. For example, CH4. Lightest H (1), heaviest C (12). Sum 13. Not matching.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. Let me try to think of the elements again. The sum needs to be one of the options: 25,29,31,35.

Wait, if X is a compound containing F and another element. F has atomic mass ~19. So if the other element is Na (23), sum is 19+23=42. Not matching.

Alternatively, X contains O and Cl. O is 16, Cl is 35.5. Sum 51.5. Not matching.

Wait, what about X being a mixture of H and Cl? H is 1, Cl 35.5. Sum 36.5. Close to option A (35), but not exact.

Alternatively, X could be HCl. H has isotopes H-1 and H-2. Cl has Cl-35 and Cl-37. So the lightest possible is H-1 (1) and Cl-35 (35), sum 36. Heaviest is H-2 (2) and Cl-37 (37), sum 39. Neither matches the options.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of C-12 and O-18. Sum 12+18=30. Not matching.

Wait, another thought: the product of X and a keto acid has two O atoms. If X is a diatomic molecule like O2, then the reaction with a keto acid would perhaps form something with O's. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonyl group, but that's part of a larger molecule.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think of the possible substances X could be based on the other clues.

X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. One possibility is that X is a halogen, like Cl2. But Cl2 as a reagent is used in various reactions, like substitution.

Wait, if X is Cl2, then when it reacts with Y (perhaps water), it produces HClO (chlorine hypochlorite), HCl, and maybe ClO^- or something. But the gas W would be Cl2? No, because X is Cl2 reacting with Y.

Alternatively, perhaps X is Cl2 and Y is water, producing HCl and HOCl. But the gas released would be Cl2 if it's a decomposition, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonate, Y is an acid, producing CO2, which fits W's condition.

So, X is a carbonate, Y is an acid. The precipitate G is the salt. If Y is a strong acid, the salt may be soluble, but if Y is weak, G could precipitate.

Assuming G is the salt, when heated, it decomposes into oxide and CO2. So B would be the oxide. The melting point of B is near 277 K.

Wait, let's pick X as Na2CO3. Y is H2SO4. The reaction would produce Na2SO4, CO2, and H2O. Na2SO4 is soluble in water, so no precipitate. So this doesn't fit.

Alternatively, X is CaCO3, Y is HCl. The reaction produces CaCl2, CO2, and H2O. CaCl2 is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps Y is a weak acid, like acetic acid. So X is CaCO3, Y is CH3COOH. The reaction may not proceed much, but if it does, it produces Ca(CH3COO)2, which is sparingly soluble. So it may precipitate. Then G is Ca(CH3COO)2. When heated, it decomposes into CaO, CO2, and CH3COOH (which may decompose further). So B would be CaO. But CaO's melting point is much higher than 277 K.

Alternatively, perhaps B is the anhydrous form of the acid produced. For example, if the acid is concentrated, it could form a different compound. Not sure.

Another angle: the product of X and a keto acid has two O atoms. If X is Na, the product is sodium acetate (CH3COONa), which has two O's in the acetate. So X is Na.

So, X is Na. Now, the elements in X are Na. The lightest isotope is Na-23 (23), heaviest Na-25 (25). So cumulative atomic masses are 23 +25=48. But that's not an option.

Wait, another thought: perhaps X is not just Na, but a compound like NaHCO3. But then the elements would be Na, H, C, O. The lightest element is H (1), heaviest O (16). Sum 17. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps X is NaOH. The elements are Na, O, H. Lightest H (1), heaviest Na (23). Sum 24. Not matching.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Let me look at the options again.

The options are:

A) 35

B) 25

C) 31

D) 29

I need to find a sum that matches one of these.

Wait, if X is Mg, the lightest isotope is Mg-24 (24), heaviest Mg-26 (26). Sum 50. Not matching.

Wait, if X is a compound containing C and O, like CO, the sum would be 12 (C) +16 (O) =28. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps X is a diatomic molecule like O2. O's isotopes are 16, 17, 18. So the lightest is 16, heaviest 18. Sum 34. Not matching.

Wait, another idea: perhaps X is a mixture of two isotopes, like Cl-35 and Cl-35. Then the sum would be 35 +35=70. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps X contains Cl-35 and another element with a lower mass. For example, Cl-35 and H-1. Sum 35 +1=36. Close to option A (35), but not exact.

Wait, perhaps the elements are Cl (35) and something else with a mass of 0. That's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the elements are Cl (35) and another element with a mass of 0.5. Not possible.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me try to think of the possible answers based on the options given.

The options are 25, 29, 31, 35.

If the sum is 25, possible elements are Na (23) and H (2, as D is 2). 23 +2=25. So if X contains Na and H, then the sum is 25. But Na and H would form NaH, which is a compound. I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, if X is NH3, sum would be N (14) + H (1) =15. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the elements are Mg (24) and B (5). 24 +5=29. Which is option D.

Wait, Mg is 24, B is 5. Sum 29. That's option D.

So, if X contains Mg and B, the sum would be 29. But why would X contain B?

Alternatively, perhaps X is a borohydride, like LiBH4. Li is 7, B is 5, H is 1. The sum of lightest (Li,7) and heaviest (B,5) is 12, which doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound containing Mg and B, like MgB2. But MgB2 is a superconductor, but I'm not sure about its usage as a reagent.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound with Mg and O. Mg is 24, O is 16. Sum 40. Not matching.

Hmm. I'm not getting anywhere. Let me take a guess based on the options. The most plausible sum I can think of is 25, which would correspond to option B.

But earlier analysis suggests that the lightest element could be H (1) and the heaviest Na (23), sum 24. Not 25.

Alternatively, if the heaviest is 24 (Mg), and the lightest is 1 (H), sum 25. So option B.

So, perhaps X contains H and Mg. For example, MgH2. But MgH2 is a compound, but I'm not sure about its common usage.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of H and Mg isotopes. But that seems unlikely.

Another angle: the product of a keto acid and X has two oxygen atoms. If X is H2O, the product could be something like CH3COOH + H2O → no reaction. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is H2, and the reaction with a keto acid produces something with two O's. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is a hemiacetal or acetal, but that's stretching it.

Given that I'm stuck, I'll make an educated guess based on the options and the earlier analysis. The most plausible sum seems to be 25 (option B), which could correspond to elements like Mg (24) and H (1), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, it could be Na (23) and something else, but I can't think of what.

Another possibility is that the elements are C (12) and O (16), sum 28. Not matching.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the elements are O (16) and F (19). Sum 35. Which is option A. So if X contains O and F, the sum is 35. But why would X be a compound of O and F?

Alternatively, perhaps X is a fluoride, like NaF. The elements are Na (23) and F (19). Sum 42. Not matching.

Hmm. I'm not making progress, so I'll have to go with the best guess. I think the answer is B) 25.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying Substance X, which reacts violently with liquid Y to release gas W, forms a precipitate G, and when G is heated, releases B. The melting point of B is approximately 277 K. Additionally, the product of a keto acid reacting with X contains two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and the task is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Gas W**: The molecule of W has the same number of protons and neutrons. Possible candidates include CO₂ (22 protons and 22 neutrons) or O₂ (16 protons and 16 neutrons). CO₂ fits the violent reaction scenario with a carbonate and acid.

2. **Precipitate G and B**: When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K (4°C). This suggests B could be a solid with a low melting point, such as a hydrate or basic carbonate.

3. **Reaction with Keto Acid**: The product of X and a keto acid contains two oxygen atoms. If X is a metal like Na, the product could be sodium acetate (CH₃COONa), where the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) contributes two oxygen atoms.

4. **Isotopes in X**: X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. For example, if X is Na, the isotopes are Na-23, Na-24, and Na-25. The lightest isotope (Na-23) has an atomic mass of 23, and the heaviest (Na-25) has an atomic mass of 25. The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X would then be 23 + 25 = 48. However, this does not match the options provided.

5. **Cumulative Atomic Masses**: The options are 25, 29, 31, and 35. These sums suggest pairs of elements with specific atomic masses. For example:
   - **Option B (25)**: Could correspond to Mg (24) and H (1), summing to 24 + 1 = 25.
   - **Option D (29)**: Could correspond to N (14) and Cl (15), summing to 14 + 15 = 29.
   - **Option C (31)**: Could correspond to C (12) and P (19), summing to 12 + 19 = 31.
   - **Option A (35)**: Could correspond to O (16) and Cl (19), summing to 16 + 19 = 35.

6. **Best Guess**: Based on the analysis, the most plausible sum is **25 (Option B)**, corresponding to Mg (24) and H (1). This aligns with the idea that X could be a compound like MgH₂ or a related reagent in organic chemistry.

ANSWER: B
