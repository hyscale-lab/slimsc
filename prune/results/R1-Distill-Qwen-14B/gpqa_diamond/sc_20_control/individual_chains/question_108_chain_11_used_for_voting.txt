Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it.

The question says the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis and has a value of 1 Tesla. The orbital magnetic quantum number m is small, so m is maybe 0 or 1 or something like that. I'm supposed to compare the expectation value of the Hamiltonian (which I think is the paramagnetic coupling term) with the transition energy ΔE of hydrogen. The wavelength given is 0.4861 micrometers, which I remember is the Balmer series, specifically the H-alpha line. That corresponds to a transition in hydrogen from n=2 to n=1, but wait, no, Balmer is n=3 to n=2. Oh right, H-alpha is 3→2, and the wavelength is about 656 nm, but wait the given here is 0.4861 micrometers which is 486.1 nm. Oh, wait that's the Balmer series too but perhaps a different transition. Wait, maybe it's the H-beta line? Because Balmer series has λ around 486 nm when it's n=4→2. So the transition energy ΔE would be on the order of the energy difference between these levels.

Now, the paramagnetic coupling term is probably related to the Zeeman effect, which is the interaction between the magnetic moment of an electron and an external magnetic field. The paramagnetic term in the Hamiltonian is H' = -μ·B. The magnetic moment μ for orbital motion is given by μ = (eħ)/(2m) * (L/m_e c^2) ? Wait, maybe I should think about it differently. The orbital magnetic moment is μ_L = (μ_B) * L, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton. The Bohr magneton is (eħ)/(2m_e), right?

So the paramagnetic term's expectation value would be ⟨H'⟩ = -μ_L · B. Since B is along Oz, which I think is the z-axis, so L would have a component along z. So ⟨H'⟩ = -μ_B * ⟨L_z⟩ * B. But wait, what's the expectation value of L_z? For a state with quantum number m, ⟨L_z⟩ = mħ. So the expectation value would be -μ_B * m ħ * B. Wait no, because μ_L is (μ_B) L, so H' = -μ_L · B = -μ_B B L_z. So ⟨H'⟩ = -μ_B B ⟨L_z⟩ = -μ_B B m ħ ?

Wait, no, hold on. L_z is mħ, so ⟨L_z⟩ = mħ. So ⟨H'⟩ = -μ_B B m ħ? Wait, no, because μ_L is (eħ/(2m_e)) * L, so H' is proportional to L_z. So H' = -μ_L · B = - (eħ/(2m_e)) * B * L_z. So ⟨H'⟩ would be -(eħ B)/(2m_e) * ⟨L_z⟩. Which is -(eħ B)/(2m_e) * m ħ. Because ⟨L_z⟩ = m ħ. Wait, but I might have messed up some factors here.

Alternatively, maybe the paramagnetic term is written as H' = (e/(2m_e c)) * B · L. Or is it? I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The magnetic dipole moment μ is given by μ = (eħ)/(2m_e) * (L/(m_e c^2)) ? Wait, no. Alternatively, μ_L is (μ_B) * L, where μ_B = (eħ)/(2m_e). So yes, H' would be -μ_L · B. So H' = -μ_B B L_z. So the expectation value is ⟨H'⟩ = -μ_B B ⟨L_z⟩. And since ⟨L_z⟩ is mħ, this becomes -μ_B B m ħ.

Wait, no. Wait, L_z has eigenvalues m ħ. So ⟨L_z⟩ = m ħ. So ⟨H'⟩ would be -μ_B * B * (m ħ). Wait, but μ_B is (eħ)/(2m_e). So substituting that in, ⟨H'⟩ = -(eħ/(2m_e)) * B * m ħ. Wait, that would be H' in terms of e, ħ, m_e, B, and m.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the magnitude, because the question is about the order of magnitude. So let's compute |⟨H'⟩|.

μ_B is approximately 9.274×10^-24 J/T. B is given as 1 T. m is small, let's say m=1 for the highest in this case. So m=1. So |⟨H'⟩| = μ_B * B * m. So 9.27e-24 J/T * 1 T * 1 = 9.27e-24 J.

Now, what's the transition energy ΔE? The wavelength λ is 0.4861 micrometers, which is about 486 nm. Using the relation E = hc/λ. Let me compute that.

h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s. λ is 486.1e-9 meters.

So E = (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) / (486.1e-9 m) 

Calculating numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. 

Divide by 486.1e-9 m: 1.9878e-25 / 486.1e-9 = 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 ≈ 4.086e-19 J.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation. 486.1e-9 m is 4.861e-7 m. So 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 = (1.9878 /4.861) * 1e-18 ≈ 0.4086 * 1e-18 = 4.086e-19 J.

So ΔE is approximately 4.086e-19 J.

Now, comparing |⟨H'⟩| of 9.27e-24 J with ΔE of ~4e-19 J.

So H' is about 9.27e-24 J, and ΔE is 4e-19 J. So H' is much smaller than ΔE. So the paramagnetic coupling term is much less than the transition energy.

Therefore, the expectation value of H is much less than ΔE. So the correct option would be C) ⟨H⟩ ≪ ΔE.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again: in the hydrogen atom, the transition energy is on the order of eV. Let me check what 4e-19 J is in eV. Since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So 4e-19 J is about 2.5 eV, which sounds right for a hydrogen transition.

And the paramagnetic term is 9.27e-24 J. Converting to eV: 9.27e-24 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 5.79e-5 eV. So about 5.8e-5 eV.

So ΔE is 2.5 eV, and the paramagnetic term is ~0.000058 eV. So 0.000058 is way smaller than 2.5. So yes, ⟨H'⟩ is much smaller than ΔE.

So the correct option is C) ⟨H⟩ ≪ ΔE.

To compare the paramagnetic coupling term \(\langle H' \rangle\) with the transition energy \(\Delta E\) of the hydrogen atom, we analyze the given parameters:

1. **Paramagnetic Coupling Term**:  
   The paramagnetic coupling term arises from the Zeeman effect, where the Hamiltonian is \(H' = -\mu_L \cdot B\). The orbital magnetic moment is \(\mu_L = \mu_B L\), where \(\mu_B = \frac{e\hbar}{2m_e}\) is the Bohr magneton. For a magnetic field \(B\) along the \(z\)-axis, the expectation value of \(H'\) is:  
   \[
   \langle H' \rangle = -\mu_B B \langle L_z \rangle
   \]  
   Since \(\langle L_z \rangle = m\hbar\), we have:  
   \[
   \langle H' \rangle = -\mu_B B m \hbar
   \]  
   Substituting \(\mu_B \approx 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T}\), \(B = 1 \, \text{T}\), and \(m = 1\), the magnitude is:  
   \[
   |\langle H' \rangle| \approx 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}
   \]

2. **Transition Energy \(\Delta E\)**:  
   The transition energy is calculated using the wavelength \(\lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m} = 486.1 \, \text{nm}\). The energy is given by:  
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
   \]  
   Substituting \(h \approx 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\), \(c \approx 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\), and \(\lambda = 486.1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m}\):  
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{486.1 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 4.086 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
   \]  
   Converting to electron volts (\(1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\)):  
   \[
   \Delta E \approx \frac{4.086 \times 10^{-19}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 2.5 \, \text{eV}
   \]

3. **Comparison**:  
   The paramagnetic coupling term \(|\langle H' \rangle| \approx 9.27 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}\) is much smaller than \(\Delta E \approx 4.086 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\). In terms of energy scales, \(|\langle H' \rangle|\) is approximately \(5.8 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV}\), which is negligible compared to \(\Delta E \approx 2.5 \, \text{eV}\).

Thus, the paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy of the hydrogen atom. The correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
