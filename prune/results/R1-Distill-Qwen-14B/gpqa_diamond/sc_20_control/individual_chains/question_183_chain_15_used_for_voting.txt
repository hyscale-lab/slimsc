Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about finding the index of hydrogen deficiency for a product formed from a specific reaction. The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. The reaction conditions are red phosphorus and excess HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus is often used with iodine in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, but wait, no, wait. Oh right! Wait, red phosphorus and iodine are used together in the Heyns reaction or for the elimination of certain groups. Oh wait, wait, more accurately, when you have a carbonyl group adjacent to a leaving group, sometimes it's a situation for elimination. Oh, but in this case, the reaction is with HI. So maybe it's a halogenation or something else.

Wait, wait, actually, I think when you have a carbonyl group and treat it with HI and red phosphorus, it's a way to convert the carbonyl into a diiodide. Oh wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Red phosphorus and iodine are used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction to reduce carbonyl groups, but that's usually under high heat and with amines. Alternatively, I've heard of the Clemmensen reduction, which uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and heat to reduce ketones to alkanes. But that's a different setup.

Wait, but in this problem, it's red phosphorus and excess HI. Oh! Oh right, I think this is the situation where a carbonyl group is being converted into an iodide. So, like in the case of a ketone, when treated with HI and red phosphorus, the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by two iodine atoms. Wait, no, maybe that's not exactly right. Let me think more carefully.

Red phosphorus and HI: I recall that when a carbonyl group is treated with excess HI, it can undergo a reaction where the carbonyl is converted into a diiodide. For example, a ketone (R2CO) reacting with HI could form R2C=CH2I, but wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe it's the formation of a geminal diiodide. Oh, yes, I think that's correct. So, the carbonyl group (C=O) is converted into a C-I2 group. So, in the starting material, there's a formyl group (CHO), which is a carbonyl. So, when reacted with excess HI and red phosphorus, that CHO group would become CH2I2?

Wait, wait, no, I think when a carbonyl is treated with HI, especially in the presence of red phosphorus, it's a way to form a vicinal dihalide. Wait, no, let me think about the mechanism. The carbonyl group is attacked by HI. The oxygen attacks HI, but wait, maybe it's a two-step process. Oh, wait, maybe I should think about this as the formation of a geminal diiodide. So, the carbonyl becomes a diiodide, so the carbon that was double-bonded to O now has two iodines attached. So, CHO becomes CHI2.

Wait, but in the presence of red phosphorus, perhaps it's a different reaction. Oh, perhaps it's the iodination of the carbonyl group. Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up reactions. Another possibility is that the carbonyl is undergoing a Wittig-like reaction, but that doesn't seem to fit here. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution. Let me think again.

Wait, I think I can find this in my notes. Oh yes, the reaction of a carbonyl with HI in the presence of red phosphorus leads to the formation of a geminal diiodide. So, the carbonyl group (RCO-) becomes RCI2. So, the formyl group (CHO) would become CH2I2? Wait, no, the formyl is RCHO, so the product would be RCH2I2. Wait, no, the carbonyl (O=CR) becomes CR with two I's attached. So, RCO → RI2.

So, in this case, the starting compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So, the structure is a cyclohexene ring. Let me try to imagine it: cyclohexene means a six-membered ring with a double bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 5. Position 2 is a formyl group (CHO), and position 5 is a vinyl group (CH2CH2? Wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH-). So, 5-vinyl would be a substituent at position 5. Also, the cyclohexene has a double bond at position 3, meaning between carbons 3 and 4 (since it's cyclohex-3-ene).

Wait, but the starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So, cyclohex-3-ene has a double bond between 3 and 4. The substituents are at positions 2 (CHO) and 5 (vinyl group). And the carboxylic acid is at which position? Oh, the name is cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, so the carboxylic acid (COOH) is at position 1, since the numbering starts such that the double bond is between 3 and 4. So, position 1 is the COOH group, position 2 is CHO, position 5 is CH2CH2 (no, wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-). Wait, no: 5-vinyl would be a substituent at position 5, which is CH2CH2? No. Wait, the substituent is a vinyl group, which is a CH2CH2 group attached via the CH2? No, wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-, so the substituent is a CH2CH2 group with a double bond. So, the 5-vinyl substituent would be attached as CH2-CH2, but wait, no—vinyl is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So, the substituent is a vinyl group (CH2CH2 with a double bond), but how exactly?

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw the structure mentally. The cyclohexene ring has a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. The substituents are at 2 (CHO), 5 (vinyl), and position 1 is the COOH group. So, the positions are arranged as follows: 1 (COOH), 2 (CHO), 3 (double bond start), 4 (double bond end), 5 (vinyl), and position 6 would be the remaining CH2 group.

Now, considering the reaction: the carbonyl group (CHO) at position 2 is going to react with HI and red phosphorus. As I thought earlier, this will convert the carbonyl into a geminal diiodide. So, the CHO becomes CHI2. So, the formyl group is replaced by CHI2.

But wait, the carboxylic acid group (COOH) is also a carbonyl. Oh, wait, no. The carboxylic acid is a COOH group, which has a carbonyl. But when the starting molecule is treated with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps that COOH group also reacts. Or does only the formyl group react?

Wait, the starting material is a cyclohexene with a formyl group and a vinyl group and a carboxylic acid. So, the reaction conditions are with excess HI and red phosphorus. So, probably, both carbonyl groups would react. But wait, the carboxylic acid is a strong acid, but in this reaction, maybe it's being converted into an acid iodide or something else.

Wait, but the reaction is with HI and red phosphorus. So, perhaps the formyl group (CHO) and the carboxylic acid (COOH) both undergo the same reaction. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again about each group.

The formyl group (CHO) is a carbonyl. The carboxylic acid (COOH) has a carbonyl as well. So, when treated with HI and red phosphorus, would both carbonyls be converted into geminal diiodides?

Alternatively, maybe the carboxylic acid group isn't reacting under these conditions. Because I remember that the reaction of HI with a carboxylic acid might not proceed as readily as with a ketone or aldehyde. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more selective towards the aldehyde group.

Wait, but the question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product. So, perhaps the reaction causes certain groups to be eliminated or formed, which affects the rings or double bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the elimination of the COOH group. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently. The starting material has certain double bonds and rings. The reaction could either add or remove these.

Wait, the starting material has a cyclohexene ring (so one double bond), a vinyl group (another double bond), and a formyl group (which is a carbonyl, but not a double bond in the ring). So, the initial structure has two double bonds: the cyclohexene's and the vinyl group. Additionally, the formyl group is another double bond (C=O), but that's a carbonyl.

Wait, but for the index of hydrogen deficiency, each double bond, ring, or triple bond counts as one. So, the starting material has a cyclohexene ring (1), a vinyl double bond (2), and the formyl carbonyl is another double bond (3). But wait, wait, no. The formyl group's carbonyl is a double bond, but it's part of the molecule. So, the initial molecule has three double bonds: cyclohexene (1), vinyl (2), formyl (3). But wait, the cyclohexene is a ring with one double bond, so that's one hydrogen deficiency. The vinyl group is a substituent with another double bond, that's another, and the formyl group's carbonyl is a third. The carboxylic acid's carbonyl is a fourth. So, the starting molecule has four double bonds, meaning an index of 4.

But wait, I'm not sure. Let me think again. The index of hydrogen deficiency is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2, where C is the number of carbons, H hydrogens, X halogens, N nitrogens. But maybe it's easier to count the degrees of unsaturation.

Each ring or double bond is a degree of unsaturation. Each triple bond is two, etc.

So, the starting molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's count the rings and double bonds.

- Cyclohexene ring: one ring and one double bond. So, that's two degrees of unsaturation (since a ring is one, and a double bond is another). Wait, no, a ring is one, a double bond is another. So, cyclohexene has a six-membered ring with a double bond, so that's two degrees: one from the ring and one from the double bond.

Wait, no. Wait, the ring itself is one degree (since a ring is equivalent to a single double bond in terms of degrees of unsaturation). So, a cyclohexane is one degree (the ring). If it's cyclohexene, one double bond inside the ring, so the ring is one, the double bond is another—so two degrees.

Then, the vinyl group is a substituent with a double bond. So that's another degree.

The formyl group is a carbonyl (C=O), another degree.

The carboxylic acid group is a COOH, which is another carbonyl. So that's another degree.

So, in total, the starting molecule has 2 (from cyclohexene) + 1 (vinyl) + 1 (formyl) + 1 (COOH) = 5 degrees of unsaturation.

Wait, but wait, the COOH group has a carbonyl, so that's another degree. So, starting with 5 degrees.

Now, when the starting material reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI, what happens?

Assuming that the formyl group (CHO) is converted into CH2I2. So, the CHO becomes CH2I2. So, the carbonyl (C=O) becomes single bonds to I. So, that would reduce the degree of unsaturation by one. Because the C=O becomes C-I2, which is single bonds. So, that reduces the index by one.

Wait, but what about the carboxylic acid group (COOH)? Does it react as well? The COOH group is a strong acid, but under these conditions, would it react?

Another possibility is that the carboxylic acid is converted into an acid iodide. For example, RCOOH + HI → RCOI + H2O? Or perhaps more likely, under certain conditions, the COOH could be converted into a diiodide as well. But I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction only affects the formyl group. Let's proceed with that assumption first.

So, when the formyl group (CHO) is converted into CH2I2, the carbonyl (C=O) is gone, so that's a reduction of one degree of unsaturation. The vinyl group's double bond remains, the cyclohexene's double bond remains, the COOH's carbonyl is still present.

Wait, but the COOH's carbonyl is still a double bond, so that doesn't change. So, the total degrees of unsaturation after the reaction would be:

Cyclohexene: 2 degrees (ring and double bond)
Vinyl group: 1 degree
Formyl group: 0 (now CH2I2)
COOH: 1 degree (carbonyl)
So, 2 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 4 degrees.

Wait, but wait. The cyclohexene has a ring and a double bond. So, that's two degrees. The vinyl group has a double bond: one. The formyl's carbonyl is gone, so that's minus one. COOH's carbonyl is still present, so that's one. So, initial degrees: 5. After the reaction, 4.

Alternatively, perhaps the COOH group doesn't react, so its carbonyl remains, but the formyl is gone.

Wait, but let's also consider the possibility that the COOH group is converted into something else. For example, maybe it's deprotonated and then reacts with HI. But the presence of red phosphorus makes me think it's involved in the formation of a diiodide.

Wait, another approach. If the reaction with HI and red phosphorus converts carbonyl groups into diiodides, then both the formyl and the COOH groups would be converted. So, the formyl (CHO) becomes CH2I2, and the COOH (COOH) becomes COI2 (but wait, COOH is OOH? No, wait, perhaps the COOH is converted into something else. Let me think.

Wait, the carboxylic acid is RCOOH. If it reacts with excess HI, perhaps it becomes RCOI2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction conditions cause the carboxylic acid to be converted into an acid iodide, RCOI. But in the presence of excess HI, maybe both carbonyls are attacked.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident about that. Alternatively, maybe only the formyl group reacts because it's more reactive than the carboxylic acid group. So, perhaps only the formyl group is converted into CH2I2, and the COOH remains as is.

So, the product would have:

- The cyclohexene ring (2 degrees)
- The vinyl group (1)
- The formyl group converted, so no more double bond there (so 0, was 1 before)
- The carboxylic acid's carbonyl remains (1)

So, total degrees: 2+1+0+1 =4.

But wait, the original structure is a cyclohexene with a formyl group, a vinyl group, and a carboxylic acid. So, after reaction, the formyl becomes CH2I2 and the carboxylic acid remains as COOH.

Wait, but then the product would have the cyclohexene ring (2), vinyl (1), and COOH carbonyl (1). So, 4.

But the question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product. So, if the starting material has 5 degrees, and the product has 4, then the index is 4.

Wait, but the options are A)1, B)3, C)5, D)0.

Wait, none of the options are 4. So perhaps I made a mistake in my reasoning.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't just affect the formyl group but also the cyclohexene ring.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction conditions cause elimination. For example, maybe the carbonyl is converted into a CH2I2 group, and the ring's double bond is reduced. Or perhaps the ring remains, but something else happens.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the product structure. Let's say the formyl group (CHO) becomes CH2I2. The COOH group remains as is, so it's still a carbonyl.

Now, the product would have a cyclohexene ring (still a double bond), a CH2I2 group, a vinyl group (still a double bond), and a COOH group (still a carbonyl). So, the degrees of unsaturation would be:

- Cyclohexene: 2 (ring and double bond)
- Vinyl: 1
- COOH: 1
- Formyl: 0 (since it's now CH2I2)
Total: 2 + 1 + 1 =4.

But the options don't include 4. Hmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, maybe the reaction also affects the cyclohexene ring. Let me think: in the presence of HI and red phosphorus, perhaps the cyclohexene's double bond is reduced. But wait, red phosphorus is usually used in reductions, like in the Birch reduction, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, in the presence of HI, maybe the ring's double bond is opened or something.

Wait, perhaps after the reaction, the cyclohexene ring's double bond is hydrogenated. Wait, but the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, not with H2 and a catalyst. So, perhaps the cyclohexene ring remains as is.

Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl group's double bond is hydrogenated. But again, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction causes the elimination of the COOH group. Wait, but under what conditions would that happen? Maybe not.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the overall reaction. The starting material has the formula C8H6O3 (maybe? Let me calculate: cyclohexene is C6H10, but with substituents. Let me count the substituents. The starting molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

Breaking it down: cyclohexene (C6H8, because cyclohexene is C6H10, but wait, no, wait. A six-membered ring with one double bond has formula C6H10. So, cyclohexene: C6H10.

Then, substituents: formyl group is CHO (so adds one C and one O), vinyl group is CH2CH2 (adds two C, but wait, no, the vinyl is CH2=CH-, so it's a substituent with one C because it's attached via one carbon. Wait, the substituent is a vinyl group (-CH2-CH2?), no, no, it's a substituent at position 5, which is a vinyl group, so the substituent is a CH2CH2 group with a double bond. Wait, perhaps better to calculate the molecular formula.

The starting molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

So, the base is cyclohex-3-ene. Then, substituents are at positions 2 and 5.

Position 2: formyl group (CHO) → adds 1 C, 1 O.
Position 5: vinyl group (CH2=CH-) → adds 2 C, 1 O (no, wait, the vinyl is CH2=CH-, so it's CH2-CH2 but with a double bond. So, the substituent is -CH2CH2? No, the vinyl group is -CH2-CH2 with a double bond. Wait, no, the vinyl group is a substituent where the ring is attached to a CH2-CH2 group with a double bond between the two CH2s. So, the substituent is -CH2CH2, but that can't be right because that would be a single bond. Wait, no, the substituent is a vinyl group, which is -CH2CH2 but with a double bond between the two carbons, so it's -CH2-CH2 with a double bond, making it -CH2-CH2? No, the substituent is -CH2-CH2, but that doesn't add up. Actually, a vinyl group is CH2=CH-; when attached to the ring, it becomes -CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the two CH2? No, that's not correct. Let me think again.

A vinyl group is CH2=CH-. So, when attached to a ring, it's as a substituent at the 5 position: the ring carbon at position 5 is connected to a CH2 group, which is double-bonded to another CH2? No, that's not right. The structure is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So, the substituent is a vinyl group, which is CH2=CH- attached to the ring.

So, the substituent adds 2 carbons (since the vinyl is CH2=CH-), so the total carbons would be 6 (cyclohexene) + 1 (formyl) + 2 (vinyl) + 2 (COOH, since COOH is -COOH, which is two O's and one more O from the acid, but the carbons are already counted in the cyclohexene). Wait, maybe it's better to count all the carbons.

Cyclohexene ring: 6 C.

Formyl group: 1 C (CHO).

Vinyl group: 2 C (CH2=CH-).

Carboxylic acid: the COOH is attached to the ring, so another C? Wait, no, the ring already includes the position where COOH is attached. So, COOH doesn't add a carbon beyond the ring. So, total carbons: 6 (ring) + 1 (CHO) + 2 (vinyl) = 9 C.

Hydrogens: Let's count.

Cyclohexene: C6H10, but with substituents.

Each substituent takes away a hydrogen from the ring.

For 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid:

Each substituent (CHO at 2, vinyl at 5, COOH at 1) replaces a hydrogen.

So, the base cyclohexene has 10 H.

Each substituent at positions 1, 2, and 5 would replace three H's.

But let's think differently. The formula can be calculated as:

Each substituent adds certain H's.

Formyl (CHO): CHO has one H (the H attached to C in CHO, but wait, the structure is R-CHO, so the CHO group is attached to the ring. So, the ring carbon at position 2 has a CH2 group? No, wait, the ring carbon is connected to the CHO group, so it's a CH group (since the ring is CH2 normally, but with substituent, it becomes CH attached to O).

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to write the molecular formula.

The starting molecule is:

Cyclohexene (C6H10) with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 5.

Position 1: COOH → adds O's but no C beyond the ring. COOH is -COOH, so it's -COOH, which is O2.

Position 2: CHO → adds 1 C and 1 O.

Position 5: CH2=CH- → adds 2 C and a double bond (so no added H's beyond the substituent).

So, the molecular formula would be:

C: 6 (ring) + 1 (CHO) + 2 (vinyl) = 9 C.

O: 2 (COOH) + 1 (CHO) = 3 O.

H: Let's calculate.

The base cyclohexene without substituents is C6H10.

Each substituent replaces a hydrogen.

- COOH at position 1: replaces one H.
- CHO at position 2: replaces one H.
- Vinyl at position 5: replaces one H.

So, total H's would be 10 - 3 (replaced) + H's from substituents.

CHO substituent: CHO has one H.

Vinyl substituent: CH2=CH- has two H's on the CH2 and one on the CH (but wait, the substituent is CH2=CH-, so the attached carbon is CH2, which has two H's, and the other CH in the vinyl has one H. So, the substituent has 3 H's.

COOH substituent: COOH has two O's but how many H's? The COOH group is -COOH, which has two O's and the H is on the OH. So, the substituent adds one H (from the OH) and takes away the one H from the ring.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the formula as:

Each substituent can be considered for their H contribution.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the reaction product's structure and then compute the index.

But perhaps I'm complicating it. Let me proceed.

Assuming that the formyl group is converted into CH2I2, and the COOH group remains as COOH.

In the product, the formyl group is now CH2I2, which doesn't have a double bond.

So, the degrees of unsaturation would be:

Cyclohexene ring: 2 (ring and double bond)
Vinyl group: 1 (double bond)
COOH: 1 (carbonyl)
Formyl: 0 (no longer a double bond)
So, 2 + 1 +1 =4.

But the options don't have 4. So perhaps another approach is needed.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't stop at the geminal diiodide but causes further reactions. For example, the product after the diiodide formation might undergo elimination, leading to the formation of a double bond elsewhere.

Wait, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction conditions cause the ring's double bond to be hydrogenated. But without H2 and a catalyst, I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction conditions cause the cyclohexene ring to add HI across the double bond. Wait, but that would be an addition, but the presence of red phosphorus suggests elimination or substitution.

Wait, perhaps the starting material's cyclohexene ring is a conjugated diene, but that's not the case here. So, perhaps another possibility.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction converts the aldehyde group into a CH2I2 group, and the carboxylic acid into a COI2 group. So, both carbonyls are gone.

So, the product would have:

- Cyclohexene: 2 degrees (ring and double bond)
- Vinyl: 1 degree
- Formyl: 0
- COOH: 0 (since it's converted into COI2, which is a single bond)
So, total degrees: 2 + 1 =3.

Which would make the index of hydrogen deficiency 3. Looking at the options, option B is 3.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction conditions cause the cyclohexene ring's double bond to be reduced, which would lower the index.

Wait, but I thought the reaction with HI and red phosphorus is for carbonyl groups, not for reducing double bonds. But perhaps in this case, the ring's double bond is also affected.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the reaction leads to the elimination of a molecule, affecting the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a new double bond. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the product structure again. If the formyl group becomes CH2I2, and the COOH becomes COI2, then the product would have:

- Cyclohexene ring (still with a double bond)
- Vinyl group (still with a double bond)
- No formyl carbonyl (converted)
- No COOH carbonyl (converted)

So, the degrees would be:

Cyclohexene: 2
Vinyl: 1
Formyl: 0
COOH: 0
Total: 3.

Which would match option B (3).

But why would the COOH group react? Because in the presence of excess HI and red phosphorus, perhaps both carbonyls are converted.

If that's the case, the product would have 3 degrees of unsaturation.

So, the index would be 3, which is option B.

But I'm not entirely confident because I'm not sure whether the COOH group reacts under these conditions. Maybe the COOH group is less reactive than the formyl group.

If only the formyl group reacts, the degrees would be 4, which isn't an option. So, perhaps the correct scenario is that both formyl and COOH groups are converted, leading to 3 degrees, making option B correct.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product formed when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI, we analyze the reaction and the resulting structure.

### Reaction Analysis:
1. **Starting Material**:  
   The starting compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Its structure includes:
   - A cyclohexene ring (a six-membered ring with one double bond).
   - A formyl group (CHO) at position 2.
   - A vinyl group (CH₂=CH-) at position 5.
   - A carboxylic acid group (COOH) at position 1.

   The degrees of unsaturation in the starting material are calculated as follows:
   - Cyclohexene ring: 2 degrees (1 from the ring, 1 from the double bond).
   - Vinyl group: 1 degree (from the double bond).
   - Formyl group: 1 degree (from the C=O bond).
   - Carboxylic acid group: 1 degree (from the C=O bond).  
   **Total degrees of unsaturation = 5.**

2. **Reaction with HI and Red Phosphorus**:  
   Red phosphorus and excess HI typically convert carbonyl groups (C=O) into geminal diiodides (C-I₂). Thus:
   - The formyl group (CHO) is converted into CH₂I₂, eliminating the C=O double bond.
   - The carboxylic acid group (COOH) is also converted into a geminal diiodide (COI₂), eliminating its C=O double bond.

   The vinyl group (CH₂=CH-) and the cyclohexene ring remain unaffected in this reaction.

3. **Product Structure**:  
   After the reaction, the product contains:
   - A cyclohexene ring (still has 2 degrees of unsaturation: 1 from the ring, 1 from the double bond).
   - A vinyl group (still has 1 degree of unsaturation: from the double bond).
   - A CH₂I₂ group (no double bond, so 0 degrees of unsaturation).
   - A COI₂ group (no double bond, so 0 degrees of unsaturation).  

   **Total degrees of unsaturation in the product = 3.**

### Conclusion:
The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is **3**, corresponding to option **B**.

ANSWER: B
