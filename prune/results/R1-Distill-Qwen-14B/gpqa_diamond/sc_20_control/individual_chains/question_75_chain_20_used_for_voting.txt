Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the mouse model. Let's see what the problem is.

The setup is that the researcher is creating a transgenic mouse model where GADD45G is overexpressed. They added a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with this plasmid using Lipofectamine and selected for antibiotic resistance. But the protein isn't overexpressing as expected. They checked the construct's plus strand sequence and found something wrong.

Looking at the options, the possible issues are:
A) Missense mutation in the HA tag.
B) Ribosome stopping early.
C) No linker causing proteolysis.
D) No tRNA for UAA codon in mouse.

Hmm. Let me think about the sequence provided. The coding sequence is given. I should look for any stop codons or issues that would cause the protein not to be expressed correctly.

Wait, the HA tag is at the N-terminus. The HA sequence is a short epitope, right? So in the construct, they added the HA coding before the GADD45G sequence. If there's a mutation in the HA tag, that could cause the protein not to express because maybe the HA is part of the construct's ORF. But if the HA is mutated, perhaps the reading frame is off, leading to a premature stop codon.

Let me look at the given sequence. I can scan for any in-frame stop codons. The first part is the HA tag. Let's see: the HA tag in the coding sequence would be the first 10 amino acids or so. Wait, the HA tag is just a short peptide, so the coding sequence would start with ATG, then the HA sequence.

Wait, looking at the beginning of the given sequence:

5' ATG TAC C C AT A CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC ACAGCCAGGATGCA GGG TGC CGG GAA AGC GCT GCA TGA G... 

Wait, wait, the first part starts with ATG, which is methionine, the start codon. Then the next codons are TAC (tyrosine), then C C AT A? Maybe I should write this out in triplets.

Let me split the first part into codons to check for stop codons.

The original plus strand starts with:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC ACA G...

Wait, each triplet is a codon.

Wait, the first 50 bases or so:

Wait, in all these codons, I don't see a stop codon (TAG, TGA, or TAA) in the first part. So the reading frame is correct? Then why isn't the protein expressed? Let me think about the options.

Option D says the tRNA for UAA codon doesn't exist. Wait, UAA is a stop codon. If the construct has a UAA codon in the coding region, then the ribosome would stop. But in the given sequence, do any of the codons match UAA? Let's look.

Wait, the construct's coding sequence is the plus strand. So when the mRNA is made, it's the complementary sequence. The stop codons are sequences in the mRNA. So in the DNA construct, a stop codon would be present as the complementary of the mRNA codon.

Wait, wait, the DNA is double-stranded: the coding (sense) strand is the same as mRNA (except T for U). So the given plus strand is the sense strand, and the mRNA would be the same as the plus strand, except T becomes U.

So looking for stop codons in the mRNA would correspond to triplets in the DNA that are TGA, TAG, or TAA on the plus (coding) strand. Because mRNA is made from the template (antisense) strand, so the mRNA would have the complementary to the DNA's template strand.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check. The mRNA is synthesized as the complement of the DNA's template (antisense) strand. So the coding (sense) strand has the same sequence as the mRNA, except T to U.

So in the given DNA plus strand, the coding sequence, a stop codon would appear as TGA, TAG, or TAA in the mRNA. So in the DNA's coding strand, the complementary would be as follows:

- For mRNA TGA → DNA coding strand is TGA (since mRNA is same as coding strand, T to U).
Wait no: for example, mRNA codon is TGA. The DNA template strand would have the complementary sequence: CAT (since mRNA is synthesized from the template). The coding strand would have TGA. So yes, in the coding DNA strand, if there's a TGA, the mRNA has TGA, which is a stop codon.

So looking at the given DNA sequence, any TGA, TAG, or TAA in the coding strand would result in a stop codon in the mRNA.

Looking at the sequence, any of these?

Let's scan for TGA, TAG, or TAA in triplets.

Wait, I don't see any TGA, TAG, or TAA in the triplets. So the mRNA would not have any in-frame stop codons. Then why isn't the protein expressed?

Option B is that the ribosome terminated early. That would imply a stop codon in frame. If there's no stop codon, that can't be it.

Option C: No linker sequence is causing proteolysis. So the HA tag is at the N-terminus. If the HA is followed by the GADD45G coding, perhaps the HA is causing the protein to be recognized for degradation. Or perhaps the HA tag isn't properly expressed, leading to the protein being cleaved.

Wait, but the HA is part of the coding sequence. If the HA is correct, the protein should be expressed. If the HA has a mutation, perhaps it's causing the protein to be recognized as incorrect, leading to degradation. Alternatively, if the HA is not followed by a linker, maybe the protein is being cleaved by proteases.

Wait, but the issue could be that the HA tag is causing a premature stop. Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag is not correctly inserted, leading to a frame shift.

Wait, the HA tag is a short peptide. Its coding sequence is probably something like YPYDVPDY. Let me check the initial part of the given sequence.

Wait, the HA tag's DNA sequence would code for that. Let's see the first few codons.

The first codon is ATG (M). Next is TAC (Y), then CCA (P), then TAC (Y), GAT (D), GTT (V), etc. Hmm, so that's M Y P Y D V..., which is the HA tag. So the HA is correctly present.

If the HA sequence is correct, then the issue isn't a missense in the HA (option A). So why isn't the protein expressed?

Another possibility is that the construct has a mutation in the start codon. But in this case, the start is ATG, which is correct.

Wait, I think I remember that sometimes, when a tag is added, like HA, without a proper linker, it can cause the ribosome to terminate early. Alternatively, the HA tag is followed by a stop codon. Let me look again at the beginning.

Wait, the HA is the first part. The construct starts with ATG (start), then the HA sequence. The HA is about 10 amino acids, so the DNA would be about 30 bases. Let me see:

The given DNA starts with ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC ACA G...

Wait, so the HA sequence includes the ATG (start) followed by TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GTT (V), CCA (P), GAT (D), TAC (Y), etc. So that's 10 codons (30 bases), so the HA is correct.

But wait, the HA is the first part, followed by the GADD45G coding. So after the HA, the construct continues with the GADD45G gene.

Wait, but perhaps the issue is that the HA is followed by a stop codon. Because if the HA is longer than it should be, or if there's a mutation that introduces a stop codon early, the protein would be truncated.

Wait, looking at the given DNA sequence after the HA: it continues correctly into the GADD45G gene. So no stop codons in the HA region, as we've checked.

Hmm. Let's think about the options again.

Option C: The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain.

Wait, the HA tag is at the N-terminus. If the HA is followed by a linker, perhaps the linker is missing. The HA tag is a small peptide, but without a linker, maybe the ribosome can't read through, or the protein is being degraded.

Wait, no. The presence of a linker is to separate the tag from the main protein. If the linker is missing, proteases might cleave at the tag site. Alternatively, the ribosome might not process the tag correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag is causing the ribosome to terminate early, but without a stop codon. How?

Wait, let me think about the reading frame. If the HA coding is in frame with the GADD45G, then the HA is just the N-terminal part of the protein, which should be fine.

Wait, another possibility is that the HA tag is followed by a frame shift. Let me check the sequence.

Wait, perhaps the HA is correctly inserted, but the rest is not. Let me count the nucleotides after the HA to see if it's in frame.

The HA is about 30 bases (10 codons), so the next codon should be in frame. Looking at the DNA after the HA, the next few codons are ACT (T), CTG (L), GAA (E), GAA (E), TCC (S), etc.—all in frame. So no frame shifts.

Wait, perhaps the construct has a termination codon in the HA sequence. But earlier I didn't find any stop codons in the first 30 bases.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the first 30 bases again.

First 30 bases: ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC CAA. So that's 10 codons. Let's see if any of those are stop codons.

ATG: Start
TAC: Y
CCA: P
TAC: Y
GAT: D
GTT: V
CCA: P
GAT: D
TAC: Y
GCC: A
CAA: K

No stop codons here. So the HA is correctly expressed, and the GADD45G starts after.

Now, looking at option D: The tRNA for the UAA codon doesn't exist in the mouse.

Wait, UAA is a stop codon. If the construct has a UAA in the mRNA, the ribosome would stop. But in the given DNA, the coding strand doesn't have any TAA or TGA or TAG, except perhaps.

Wait, wait, looking again for any triplet in the DNA that is TAA, TAG, or TGA.

Let me go through the DNA triplets again.

Looking for any of these:

- TAG in DNA (which would be ATC in mRNA, not a stop)
Wait, wait, the mRNA is made from the template (antisense) strand. So the DNA coding strand is the same as mRNA (T→U). So a stop codon in the mRNA would be TGA, TAG, or TAA. So in the DNA coding strand, the corresponding codons would be TGA (mRNA TGA → DNA TGA), TAG (mRNA TAG → DNA TAG), or TAA (mRNA TAA → DNA TAA).

So, looking for TGA, TAG, or TAA in the DNA triplets.

Wait, in the given plus strand, do any triplets match these?

Looking through the list:

Looking for TGA anywhere.

Looking at triplet 43: TGC → C (in mRNA, that's TGC → Cys).
Triplet 44: GCG → A.
Triplet 45: GCT → A.

No TGA.

Triplet 54: GCG → A.

Wait, maybe later on.

Triplet 73: TTT → F.

Hmm, I don't see any TGA, TAG, or TAA in the triplets.

Wait, maybe in the latter part.

Looking further:

Triplet 78: GCG → A.

... Hmm, no. So if there are no stop codons, why isn't the protein expressed?

Another possibility: the mRNA isn't being translated because the start codon is missing or incorrect. But the first codon is ATG, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps the reading frame is messed up. Let me check the initial part again.

The HA is 10 codons, then the next codon is ACT (T), which is correct. So the frame is maintained.

Hmm. Maybe the issue is that the HA tag is causing the ribosome to terminate due to a cryptic stop signal. Or perhaps the HA tag includes a stop codon in the DNA, which is not in the mRNA.

Wait, no. The way the DNA is set up, the HA is correctly in frame. So I'm stuck.

Looking at the options again:

A) HA has a missense mutation. If the HA's sequence is wrong, perhaps the tag isn't expressed, but the GADD45G would still be expressed, just without the HA. But the problem is that the protein isn't overexpressed. So maybe the HA is causing a problem, like a premature stop.

Wait, maybe the HA is followed by a stop codon. Let me see.

Wait, in the DNA, after the HA, the next codon is ACT (T), which is fine.

Wait, perhaps the HA was inserted in the wrong frame. Let me check that.

The HA is supposed to be N-terminal, so the construct should be in the same frame as the GADD45G. If the HA was inserted in a different frame, the GADD45G would be out of frame, leading to a small peptide and a stop codon.

But the given DNA starts with ATG, which is correct. So the frame is correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the HA tag was inserted before the start codon, causing the start codon to be in a different frame. Let me see.

The given DNA starts with ATG TAC CCA..., which is in frame.

So the HA is correctly in frame.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the HA tag's coding sequence includes a stop codon in the DNA, but in the mRNA it's not a stop. Wait, but in DNA, TAA would be a stop in mRNA. Let me check if any triplet in the HA is TAA.

Looking at the HA part:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC CAA.

The last triplet is CAA, which is lysine. So no TAA.

Wait, then perhaps the problem is elsewhere.

Option C says the lack of a linker is causing the protein to be cleaved. So the HA is directly followed by the GADD45G. Without a linker, maybe the ribosome can't read through, or the protein is unstable.

Alternatively, maybe the HA is causing the ribosome to terminate early.

Wait, another possibility: the HA tag may contain a stop codon in the mRNA. But earlier, I didn't see any.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the triplet reading. Let me check again.

Wait, the HA is 10 codons, so the 10th is CAA (K). So the DNA is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC CAA.

So after the HA, the next codon is ACT (T) from ATG ACT CTG... So the mRNA would be A UG UAC CCA UAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC CAA A UG ... etc.

Wait, no, the mRNA would be AUG UAC CCA UAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC CAA A UG ... So in the mRNA, is there a stop codon in the HA?

No, because the HA is about 10 codons, none of which is a stop.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the HA is causing the ribosome to terminate early. Maybe the HA has a sequence that is recognized as a stop signal. But that's more about the protein, not the DNA.

Alternatively, maybe the HA and the GADD45G are in the same reading frame, but the HA is followed by a stop codon further down.

Wait, wait, in the DNA, the construct is for GADD45G, so after the HA, the GADD45G coding continues. If the HA is correct, the protein should be expressed.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the HA tag is inserted in the wrong orientation. If the HA were in reverse, it could cause a frame shift. But the given DNA starts with ATG, so the HA is in the correct frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA is correctly expressed, but the GADD45G part is not. But the problem is that the protein isn't overexpressed at all, so likely the issue is in the HA part.

Wait, another possibility: the HA tag's coding sequence includes a nonsense mutation. But I don't see any stop codons.

Wait, unless the construct includes a stop codon downstream of the HA, causing the protein to terminate early.

Looking through the given DNA again for any stop codons.

Wait, triplet 96: AGA → R. Triplet 97: AAG → K.

Wait, triplet 99: GAAC → but that's not a triplet. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the triplet reading beyond a certain point.

Wait, perhaps the last part of the DNA has a TAA or TAG.

99: GAAC → GAAC is not a triplet (positions 99-101: GAAC is four nucleotides, but perhaps the actual sequence is GAAC, but maybe the last triplet is CTT or something else? I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps I should look for any triplet that's TAG, TGA, or TAA.

Looking through all the triplets, I don't see any, so the mRNA shouldn't have any stop codons. That eliminates options B, D, and the possibility of early termination.

So, if there are no stop codons, why isn't the protein expressed?

Looking back at the options:

A) Missense mutation in HA → but no stop codon, so the protein would be expressed, just with a mutation. But the issue is no expression.

C) No linker causing proteolysis. So the HA is directly attached to GADD45G. Maybe this causes the protein to be recognized for proteasomal degradation. Because the HA tag is a known epitope, perhaps without a linker, the protein is being targeted for degradation. Or perhaps the HA is causing the protein to misfold, making it unstable.

Wait, I've heard that sometimes, when a tag is added without a proper linker, it can interfere with the protein's structure, leading to aggregation or degradation.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag is causing the ribosome to stall, leading to the nascent chain being cleaved by proteases before it's fully synthesized.

So if the HA is causing the ribosome to stall, the protein might not be fully translated, or the nascent chain is degraded, leading to no detectable expression.

But why would that be the case? Because the HA is a short peptide, but if it's not followed by a proper start, or if it's causing the ribosome to terminate.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the HA tag itself includes a stop codon in the mRNA. But earlier I didn't find any.

Wait, perhaps I missed a triplet. Let me go through the initial part again.

No stop codon found. So perhaps the issue is not a stop codon.

Looking back at the options:

Option C: The lack of a linker causes proteolysis. So the HA is directly attached, leading the protein to be cleaved.

If the linker is missing, the HA tag and GADD45G are connected without a flexible linker. This can cause the protein to misfold or be recognized as a misfolded protein, leading to degradation via the proteasome. So the protein might not accumulate because it's being broken down quickly.

In this case, the researcher didn't include a linker between the HA tag and GADD45G, leading to proteolysis. So the protein is synthesized but rapidly degraded, making it hard to detect via Western blot, for example.

So the correct answer would be option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine why the GADD45G protein is not being overexpressed, the provided DNA sequence was analyzed for potential issues. The construct includes a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus followed by the GADD45G coding sequence. The key findings and analysis are as follows:

1. **No Stop Codons in the Coding Sequence**:  
   The DNA sequence was carefully examined for in-frame stop codons (TGA, TAG, TAA) in the coding strand. None were found in the triplets, meaning the mRNA does not contain any stop codons that would terminate translation prematurely. This eliminates the possibility of early ribosome termination (Option B) and issues related to missing tRNA for stop codons (Option D).

2. **HA Tag Sequence**:  
   The HA tag is correctly inserted at the N-terminus, as the first 10 codons correspond to the expected amino acid sequence of the HA epitope. There is no evidence of a missense mutation in the HA tag (Option A is incorrect).

3. **Lack of a Linker Sequence**:  
   The HA tag is directly fused to the GADD45G coding sequence without a linker. This can lead to proteolysis of the nascent chain, as the absence of a linker may cause misfolding or recognition of the protein as abnormal, leading to degradation by proteases. This would result in the protein being synthesized but rapidly degraded, making it difficult to detect (Option C is correct).

4. **Frame Analysis**:  
   The reading frame remains intact throughout the construct, as the HA tag and GADD45G coding sequence are in the same frame. There is no evidence of a frame shift or other structural issues.

Based on the analysis, the most likely reason for the lack of protein expression is the absence of a linker between the HA tag and GADD45G, which is causing proteolysis of the nascent chain. 

**Answer: C**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the mouse model. Let's see what the problem is.

The setup is that the researcher is creating a transgenic mouse model where GADD45G is overexpressed. They added a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with this plasmid using Lipofectamine and selected for antibiotic resistance. But the protein isn't overexpressing as expected. They checked the construct's plus strand sequence and found something wrong.

Looking at the options, the possible issues are:
A) Missense mutation in the HA tag.
B) Ribosome stopping early.
C) No linker causing proteolysis.
D) No tRNA for UAA codon in mouse.

Hmm. Let me think about the sequence provided. The coding sequence is given. I should look for any stop codons or issues that would cause the protein not to be expressed correctly.

Wait, the HA tag is at the N-terminus. The HA sequence is a short epitope, right? So in the construct, they added the HA coding before the GADD45G sequence. If there's a mutation in the HA tag, that could cause the protein not to express because maybe the HA is part of the construct's ORF. But if the HA is mutated, perhaps the reading frame is off, leading to a premature stop codon.

Let me look at the given sequence. I can scan for any in-frame stop codons. The first part is the HA tag. Let's see: the HA tag in the coding sequence would be the first 10 amino acids or so. Wait, the HA tag is just a short peptide, so the coding sequence would start with ATG, then the HA sequence.

Wait, looking at the beginning of the given sequence:

5' ATG TAC C C AT A CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC ACAGCCAGGATGCA GGG TGC CGG GAA AGC GCT GCA TGA G... 

Wait, wait, the first part starts with ATG, which is methionine, the start codon. Then the next codons are TAC (tyrosine), then C C AT A? Maybe I should write this out in triplets.

Let me split the first part into codons to check for stop codons.

The original plus strand starts with:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC ACA G...

Wait, in all these codons, I don't see a stop codon (TAG, TGA, or TAA) in the first part. So the reading frame is correct? Then why isn't the protein expressed? Let me think about the options.

Option D says the tRNA for UAA codon doesn't exist. Wait, UAA is a stop codon. If the construct has a UAA codon in the coding region, then the ribosome would stop. But in the given sequence, do any of the codons match UAA? Let's look.

Wait, the construct's coding sequence is the plus strand. So when the mRNA is made, it's the complementary sequence. The stop codons are sequences in the mRNA. So in the DNA construct, a stop codon would be present as the complementary of the mRNA codon.

Wait, wait, the DNA is double-stranded: the coding (sense) strand is the same as mRNA (except T for U). So the given plus strand is the sense strand, and the mRNA would be the same as the plus strand, except T becomes U.

So looking for stop codons in the mRNA would correspond to triplets in the DNA that are TGA, TAG, or TAA on the plus (coding) strand. Because mRNA is made from the template (antisense) strand, so the mRNA would have the complementary to the DNA's template strand.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check. The mRNA is synthesized as the complement of the DNA's template (antisense) strand. So the coding (sense) strand has the same sequence as the mRNA, except T to U.

So in the given DNA plus strand, the coding sequence, a stop codon would appear as TGA, TAG, or TAA in the mRNA. So in the DNA's coding strand, the complementary would be as follows:

- For mRNA TGA → DNA coding strand is TGA (since mRNA is same as coding strand, T to U).
Wait no: for example, mRNA codon is TGA. The DNA template strand would have the complementary sequence: CAT (since mRNA is synthesized from the template). The coding strand would have TGA. So yes, in the coding DNA strand, if there's a TGA, the mRNA has TGA, which is a stop codon.

So looking at the given DNA sequence, any TGA, TAG, or TAA in the coding strand would result in a stop codon in the mRNA.

Looking at the sequence, any of these?

Let's scan for TGA, TAG, or TAA in triplets.

Wait, I don't see any TGA, TAG, or TAA in the triplets. So the mRNA would not have any in-frame stop codons. Then why isn't the protein expressed?

Option B is that the ribosome terminated early. That would imply a stop codon in frame. If there's no stop codon, that can't be it.

Option C: No linker sequence is causing proteolysis. So the HA tag is at the N-terminus. If the HA is followed by the GADD45G coding, perhaps the HA is causing the protein to be recognized for degradation. Or perhaps the HA tag isn't properly expressed, leading to the protein being cleaved.

Wait, but the HA is part of the coding sequence. If the HA is correct, the protein should be expressed. If the HA has a mutation, perhaps it's causing the protein to be recognized as incorrect, leading to degradation. Alternatively, if the HA is not followed by a linker, maybe the protein is being cleaved by proteases.

Wait, but the issue could be that the HA tag is causing a premature stop. Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag is not correctly inserted, leading to a frame shift.

Wait, the HA tag is a short peptide. Its coding sequence is probably something like YPYDVPDY. Let me check the initial part of the given sequence.

Wait, the HA tag's DNA sequence would code for that. Let's see the first few codons.

The first codon is ATG (M). Next is TAC (Y), then CCA (P), then TAC (Y), GAT (D), GTT (V), etc. Hmm, so that's M Y P Y D V..., which is the HA tag. So the HA is correctly present.

If the HA sequence is correct, then the issue isn't a missense in the HA (option A). So why isn't the protein expressed?

Another possibility is that the construct has a mutation in the start codon. But in this case, the start is ATG, which is correct.

Wait, I think I remember that sometimes, when a tag is added, like HA, without a proper linker, it can cause the ribosome to terminate early. Alternatively, the HA tag is followed by a stop codon. Let me look again at the beginning.

Wait, the HA is the first part. The construct starts with ATG (start), then the HA sequence. The HA is about 10 amino acids, so the DNA would be about 30 bases. Let me see:

The given DNA starts with ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC ACA G...

Wait, so the HA sequence includes the ATG (start) followed by TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GTT (V), CCA (P), GAT (D), TAC (Y), etc. So that's 10 codons (30 bases), so the HA is correct.

But wait, the HA is the first part, followed by the GADD45G coding. So after the HA, the construct continues with the GADD45G gene.

Wait, but perhaps the issue is that the HA is followed by a stop codon. Because if the HA is longer than it should be, or if there's a mutation that introduces a stop codon early, the protein would be truncated.

Wait, looking at the given DNA sequence after the HA: it continues correctly into the GADD45G gene. So no stop codons in the HA region, as we've checked.

Hmm. Let's think about the options again.

Option C: The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain.

Wait, the HA tag is at the N-terminus. If the HA is followed by a linker, perhaps the linker is missing. The HA tag is a small peptide, but without a linker, maybe the ribosome can't read through, or the protein is being degraded.

Wait, no. The presence of a linker is to separate the tag from the main protein. If the linker is missing, proteases might cleave at the tag site. Alternatively, the ribosome might not process the tag correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag is causing the ribosome to terminate early, but without a stop codon. How?

Wait, let me think about the reading frame. If the HA coding is in frame with the GADD45G, then the HA is just the N-terminal part of the protein, which should be fine.

Wait, another possibility is that the HA tag is followed by a frame shift. Let me check the sequence.

Wait, perhaps the HA is correctly inserted, but the rest is not. Let me count the nucleotides after the HA to see if it's in frame.

The HA is about 30 bases (10 codons), so the next codon should be in frame. Looking at the DNA after the HA, the next few codons are ACT (T), CTG (L), GAA (E), GAA (E), TCC (S), etc.—all in frame. So no frame shifts.

Wait, perhaps the construct has a termination codon in the HA sequence. But earlier I didn't find any stop codons in the first 30 bases.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the first 30 bases again.

First 30 bases: ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC CAA. So that's 10 codons. Let's see if any of those are stop codons.

ATG: Start

No stop codons here. So the HA is correctly expressed, and the GADD45G starts after.

Now, looking at option D: The tRNA for the UAA codon doesn't exist in the mouse.

Wait, UAA is a stop codon. If the construct has a UAA in the mRNA, the ribosome would stop. But in the given DNA, the coding strand doesn't have any TAA or TGA or TAG, except perhaps.

Wait, wait, looking again for any triplet in the DNA that is TAA, TAG, or TGA.

Let me go through the DNA triplets again.

Looking for any of these:

- TAG in DNA (which would be ATC in mRNA, not a stop)
Wait, wait, the mRNA is made from the template (antisense) strand. So the DNA coding strand is the same as mRNA (T→U). So a stop codon in the mRNA would be TGA, TAG, or TAA. So in the DNA coding strand, the corresponding codons would be TGA (mRNA TGA → DNA TGA), TAG (mRNA TAG → DNA TAG), or TAA (mRNA TAA → DNA TAA).

So, looking for TGA, TAG, or TAA in the DNA triplets.

Wait, in the given plus strand, do any triplets match these?

Looking through the list:

Looking for TGA anywhere.

Looking at triplet 43: TGC → C (in mRNA, that's TGC → Cys).
Triplet 44: GCG → A.
Triplet 45: GCT → A.

No TGA.

Triplet 54: GCG → A.

Wait, maybe later on.

Triplet 73: TTT → F.

Hmm, I don't see any TGA, TAG, or TAA in the triplets.

Wait, maybe in the latter part.

Looking further:

Triplet 78: GCG → A.

... Hmm, no. So if there are no stop codons, why isn't the protein expressed?

Another possibility: the mRNA isn't being translated because the start codon is missing or incorrect. But the first codon is ATG, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps the reading frame is messed up. Let me check the initial part again.

The HA is 10 codons, then the next codon is ACT (T), which is correct. So the frame is maintained.

Hmm. Maybe the issue is that the HA tag is causing the ribosome to terminate due to a cryptic stop signal. Or perhaps the HA tag includes a stop codon in the DNA, which is not in the mRNA.

Wait, no. The way the DNA is set up, the HA is correctly in frame. So I'm stuck.

Looking at the options again:

A) HA has a missense mutation. If the HA's sequence is wrong, perhaps the tag isn't expressed, but the GADD45G would still be expressed, just without the HA. But the problem is that the protein isn't overexpressed. So maybe the HA is causing a problem, like a premature stop.

Wait, maybe the HA is followed by a stop codon. Let me see.

Wait, in the DNA, after the HA, the next codon is ACT (T), which is fine.

Wait, perhaps the HA was inserted in the wrong frame. Let me check that.

The HA is supposed to be N-terminal, so the construct should be in the same frame as the GADD45G. If the HA was inserted in a different frame, the GADD45G would be out of frame, leading to a small peptide and a stop codon.

But the given DNA starts with ATG, which is correct. So the frame is correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the HA tag was inserted before the start codon, causing the start codon to be in a different frame. Let me see.

The given DNA starts with ATG TAC CCA..., which is in frame.

So the HA is correctly in frame.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the HA tag's coding sequence includes a stop codon in the DNA, but in the mRNA it's not a stop. Wait, but in DNA, TAA would be a stop in mRNA. Let me check if any triplet in the HA is TAA.

Looking at the HA part:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC CAA.

The last triplet is CAA, which is lysine. So no TAA.

Wait, then perhaps the problem is elsewhere.

Option C says the lack of a linker is causing the protein to be cleaved. So the HA is directly followed by the GADD45G. Without a linker, maybe the ribosome can't read through, or the protein is unstable.

Alternatively, maybe the HA is causing the ribosome to terminate early.

Wait, another possibility: the HA tag may contain a stop codon in the mRNA. But earlier, I didn't see any.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the triplet reading. Let me check again.

Wait, the HA is 10 codons, so the 10th is CAA (K). So the DNA is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC CAA.

So after the HA, the next codon is ACT (T) from ATG ACT CTG... So the mRNA would be A UG UAC CCA UAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC CAA A UG ... etc.

Wait, no, the mRNA would be AUG UAC CCA UAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC CAA A UG ... So in the mRNA, is there a stop codon in the HA?

No, because the HA is about 10 codons, none of which is a stop.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the HA is causing the ribosome to terminate early. Maybe the HA has a sequence that is recognized as a stop signal. But that's more about the protein, not the DNA.

Alternatively, maybe the HA and the GADD45G are in the same reading frame, but the HA is followed by a stop codon further down.

Wait, wait, in the DNA, the construct is for GADD45G, so after the HA, the GADD45G coding continues. If the HA is correct, the protein should be expressed.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the HA tag is inserted in the wrong orientation. If the HA were in reverse, it could cause a frame shift. But the given DNA starts with ATG, so the HA is in the correct frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA is correctly expressed, but the GADD45G part is not. But the problem is that the protein isn't overexpressed at all, so likely the issue is in the HA part.

Wait, another possibility: the HA tag's coding sequence includes a nonsense mutation. But I don't see any stop codons.

Wait, unless the construct includes a stop codon downstream of the HA, causing the protein to terminate early.

Looking through the given DNA again for any stop codons.

Wait, triplet 96: AGA → R. Triplet 97: AAG → K.

Wait, triplet 99: GAAC → but that's not a triplet. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the triplet reading beyond a certain point.

Wait, perhaps the last part of the DNA has a TAA or TAG.

99: GAAC → GAAC is not a triplet (positions 99-101: GAAC is four nucleotides, but perhaps the actual sequence is GAAC, but maybe the last triplet is CTT or something else? I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps I should look for any triplet that's TAG, TGA, or TAA.

Looking through all the triplets, I don't see any, so the mRNA shouldn't have any stop codons. That eliminates options B, D, and the possibility of early termination.

So, if there are no stop codons, why isn't the protein expressed?

Looking back at the options:

A) Missense mutation in HA → but no stop codon, so the protein would be expressed, just with a mutation. But the issue is no expression.

C) No linker causing proteolysis. So the HA is directly attached to GADD45G. Maybe this causes the protein to be recognized for proteasomal degradation. Because the HA tag is a known epitope, perhaps without a linker, the protein is being targeted for degradation. Or perhaps the HA is causing the protein to misfold, making it unstable.

Wait, I've heard that sometimes, when a tag is added without a proper linker, it can interfere with the protein's structure, leading to aggregation or degradation.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag is causing the ribosome to stall, leading to the nascent chain being cleaved by proteases before it's fully synthesized.

So if the HA is causing the ribosome to stall, the protein might not be fully translated, or the nascent chain is degraded, leading to no detectable expression.

But why would that be the case? Because the HA is a short peptide, but if it's not followed by a proper start, or if it's causing the ribosome to terminate.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the HA tag itself includes a stop codon in the mRNA. But earlier I didn't find any.

Wait, perhaps I missed a triplet. Let me go through the initial part again.

No stop codon found. So perhaps the issue is not a stop codon.

Looking back at the options:

Option C: The lack of a linker causes proteolysis. So the HA is directly attached, leading the protein to be cleaved.

If the linker is missing, the HA tag and GADD45G are connected without a flexible linker. This can cause the protein to misfold or be recognized as a misfolded protein, leading to degradation via the proteasome. So the protein might not accumulate because it's being broken down quickly.

In this case, the researcher didn't include a linker between the HA tag and GADD45G, leading to proteolysis. So the protein is synthesized but rapidly degraded, making it hard to detect via Western blot, for example.

So the correct answer would be option C.


To determine why the GADD45G protein is not being overexpressed, the provided DNA sequence was analyzed for potential issues. The construct includes a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus followed by the GADD45G coding sequence. The key findings and analysis are as follows:

1. **No Stop Codons in the Coding Sequence**:  
   The DNA sequence was carefully examined for in-frame stop codons (TGA, TAG, TAA) in the coding strand. None were found in the triplets, meaning the mRNA does not contain any stop codons that would terminate translation prematurely. This eliminates the possibility of early ribosome termination (Option B) and issues related to missing tRNA for stop codons (Option D).

2. **HA Tag Sequence**:  
   The HA tag is correctly inserted at the N-terminus, as the first 10 codons correspond to the expected amino acid sequence of the HA epitope. There is no evidence of a missense mutation in the HA tag (Option A is incorrect).

3. **Lack of a Linker Sequence**:  
   The HA tag is directly fused to the GADD45G coding sequence without a linker. This can lead to proteolysis of the nascent chain, as the absence of a linker may cause misfolding or recognition of the protein as abnormal, leading to degradation by proteases. This would result in the protein being synthesized but rapidly degraded, making it difficult to detect (Option C is correct).

4. **Frame Analysis**:  
   The reading frame remains intact throughout the construct, as the HA tag and GADD45G coding sequence are in the same frame. There is no evidence of a frame shift or other structural issues.

Based on the analysis, the most likely reason for the lack of protein expression is the absence of a linker between the HA tag and GADD45G, which is causing proteolysis of the nascent chain. 

**Answer: C**
