Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere of radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but I'll try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a two-dimensional metric, right? Because the differentials are dx and dy, so it's in two dimensions. The question is about the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2.

Wait, pseudosphere—oh, right, that's a surface of constant negative curvature. The metric of a pseudosphere is similar to the hyperbolic space metric. But wait, the metric here is given in terms of x and y, but maybe it's in a different coordinate system?

Wait, the standard metric for hyperbolic space in Poincaré coordinates is something like ds² = (dr² + dz²)/z², but I'm not sure. Alternatively, in isothermal coordinates, the metric might look like (something)/(something else) times (dx² + dy²). Oh, I think the metric given here might be conformally flat because it's a multiple of (dx² + dy²). So the conformal factor is 32/(4 - x² - y²).

Wait, the denominator is 4 - (x² + y²). So that suggests that the region where this metric is defined is where 4 - (x² + y²) > 0, because otherwise the denominator would be zero or negative, making the metric singular or imaginary. So x² + y² < 4. That means the coordinates x and y are confined within a circle of radius 2. Hmm, so the maximum distance from the origin is 2 in x-y plane.

But the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius 2. Wait, a pseudosphere is a two-dimensional surface with constant negative curvature. So the area might be related to the hyperbolic geometry.

Wait, in hyperbolic geometry, the area of a circle (which would be the pseudosphere with radius r) is 2π r² (cosh(r) - 1). Wait, no, wait. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. For a circle in hyperbolic space, the area isn't just a simple formula. Or maybe I should think in terms of the metric given.

Alternatively, maybe the metric provided is the metric of a pseudosphere. Let me see. If the metric is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²), maybe this is a representation of a pseudosphere. To compute the area, perhaps I can compute the area of the 2D surface described by this metric.

Wait, the area of a two-dimensional surface is computed by integrating the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor over the surface. But since the metric is conformally flat, the determinant is just the square of the conformal factor times dx dy, right?

Wait, the metric tensor in 2D is:

[ g_xx   g_xy ]
[ g_xy   g_yy ]

In this case, g_xx = g_yy = 32/(4 - x² - y²), and g_xy = 0. So the determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²))². So the area element dA would be sqrt(det g) dx dy, which is (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy.

Wait, but wait, the area of the entire pseudosphere would be the integral of this area element over all x and y where the metric is defined, which is x² + y² <4 (since denominator must be positive). So the region of integration is the disk of radius 2.

So the area A is the double integral over x² + y² <4 of (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy.

Hmm, let's compute that. Let me change to polar coordinates because the region of integration is a circle.

In polar coordinates, x² + y² = r², and dx dy = r dr dθ.

So the integral becomes:

A = ∫ (θ from 0 to 2π) ∫ (r from 0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Separate the integrals:

A = 32 * 2π ∫ (r from 0 to 2) [r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Let me compute the radial integral ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2.

Let me make a substitution: let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r. So, -(du)/2 = r dr.

So the integral becomes ∫ [r dr]/(4 - r²) = ∫ ( - du/2 ) / u = (-1/2) ∫ (1/u) du = (-1/2) ln|u| + C.

So evaluating from r=0 to r=2:

At r=2: u=4 - (2)^2=0. So ln(0) is negative infinity. Wait, but wait, as r approaches 2, u approaches 0 from the positive side (since r² approaches 4 from below).

Wait, so the integral from 0 to 2 would be:

At r=0: u=4-0=4. So ln(4) is about 1.386.

At r approaching 2: u approaches 0, so ln(0) is -infinity. So the integral would be (-1/2) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ] = (-1/2)( -infty - ln4 ) = (1/2)(infty + ln4) which tends to infinity.

Wait, but that can't be right. The integral is divergent. So the area would be infinite.

Wait, but that's odd because the pseudosphere is a finite area surface. Or is it? Wait, no, in hyperbolic geometry, the entire space is of infinite area. But a pseudosphere, perhaps, is just a surface of revolution, but I might be getting confused.

Wait, no, a pseudosphere is a surface embedded in 3D space, but here we're talking about a 2D surface with a hyperbolic metric. So the area might indeed be infinite because the metric allows for infinite extent.

Wait, but wait, the integral we're computing is the area of the region x² + y² <4 in this metric. But if the integral diverges, then the area would be infinite. So the answer would be option D) +infty.

But wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh, wait, maybe I'm getting confused between the space and the surface. Wait, a pseudosphere is a surface with finite area? Or does it have infinite area?

Wait, maybe I should recall that the pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, and in such a geometry, the area of a circle grows exponentially with radius. So for an infinite radius, the area would be infinite. But in this case, the radius is 2, but perhaps the area is still infinite because the metric's denominator approaches zero as r approaches 2, leading the area element to blow up.

Wait, but in reality, the pseudosphere is a finite surface. Oh, wait, wait. Let me think differently. The metric given is in two dimensions, but perhaps it's a compactification. Wait, no, because the denominator approaches zero as (x² + y²) approaches 4, so the area element becomes infinite at the edge.

Hmm, but perhaps the metric represents a model that covers the entire hyperbolic plane, but in this case, the coordinates x and y are limited to a disk of radius 2, which would mean that the area computed is for a finite region but the integral would diverge. Thus, the area would be infinite.

So looking back at the options, option D is +infty. So that would be the correct answer.

The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a two-dimensional surface. The question asks for the area of a pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \). To compute the area, we use the metric to determine the area element \( dA \). For a conformally flat metric, the area element is given by:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right) dx \, dy.
\]

The region of integration is where the metric is defined, i.e., \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), which corresponds to a disk of radius 2 in the \( x \)-\( y \) plane. The total area \( A \) is then:

\[
A = \int_{x^2 + y^2 < 4} \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

Switching to polar coordinates \( x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \) and \( dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta \), the integral becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
A = 32 \cdot 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} \int_{u=4}^{u=0} \frac{1}{u} \, du = -\frac{1}{2} \left[\ln|u|\right]_4^0.
\]

As \( r \to 2 \), \( u \to 0 \), and \( \ln|u| \to -\infty \). Thus, the integral diverges, and the area becomes infinite. This divergence reflects the fact that the metric's denominator approaches zero as \( r \to 2 \), causing the area element to blow up at the boundary of the region. Therefore, the total area of the pseudosphere is infinite.

From the given options:

- **A) 0**: Incorrect, as the area is not zero.
- **B) \( 4\pi(x^2 + y^2) \)**: Incorrect, as this is not the correct expression for the area.
- **C) \( 4\pi(x^2 - y^2) \)**: Incorrect, as this is not the correct expression for the area.
- **D) \( +\infty \)**: Correct, as the area diverges due to the singularity in the metric.
