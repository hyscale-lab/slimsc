Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in organic compounds. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through each compound one by one.

Optical activity usually comes from having chiral centers, right? But wait, there's also the possibility of other factors like meso compounds or maybe some kind of symmetry that could affect it. Let me remember: a chiral center is a carbon attached to four different groups. If a compound has at least one chiral center, it can be optically active unless it's a meso compound, which has multiple chiral centers but is superimposable on its mirror image, so it's achiral.

So, I'll go through each compound given and check for these factors.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
   Hmm, this is an alkene with a chloro group and a methyl on the same carbon (but-1-ene). The Z configuration means the higher priority groups are on the same side. But wait, I'm trying to see if there's a chiral center here. The structure would be Cl attached to C1, which is also bonded to the double bond (C2). So C1 has Cl, maybe two CH2 groups or something? Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but here it's 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure is Cl-C(=CH2-CH2CH3)-CH2? Wait, maybe I'm getting mixed up.

   Alternatively, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. Substituting at 1 gives Cl and the double bond on C1. So structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double-bonded to C2. So the substituents on C1 are Cl, CH2CH2CH3 (as from the double bond), and two other groups? Wait, no—since it's but-1-ene, it's CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would make it Cl-CH2-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, but that's not correct. Wait, but in but-1-ene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So 1-chloro is Cl on C1. So structure is Cl-CH2-CH2CH2CH3? But that doesn't sound right because but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be CH2Cl-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2Cl connected to a double bond. Oh, wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would have a Cl on C1 and a methyl on C2. So the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So C1: Cl, CH2CH2CH3 (from double bond), maybe another substituent? Wait, but the structure would be Cl–C(CH2CH2CH3)=CH(CH3)? Hmm, maybe not.

   Wait, perhaps it's easier to look for possible chiral centers. C1 has Cl, double bond, and two other substituents. So for C1: attached groups are Cl, CH2CH2CH3 (from the double bond), and the adjacent C (which is connected to a methyl). Wait, no, the structure is Cl-C(=CH(CH3))–CH2CH3. So C1 is attached to Cl, the double bond (so two substituents from the double bond?), and maybe another CH2 group? I'm getting a bit stuck here.

   Alternatively, maybe the molecule is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. C2 has a methyl group and perhaps another substituent. Let me try to draw it: C1 is Cl–C(=CH(CH3))–CH2CH3. So C1 is connected to Cl, two CH2 groups (from the double bond ends), and the C2 which has a methyl. Wait, no, but C1 is connected via double bond to C2, so C1 has Cl, CH2CH3, and the double bond to C2. So C1 has three groups: Cl, CH2CH3, and the double bond (so maybe that's a double bond substituent, which would count as a substituent group? Or maybe not, since it's part of the double bond structure.)

   Oh wait, maybe there's no chiral center here. Because if C1 is connected to Cl, two CH2 groups, and the double bond, then it's not a chiral center. Because being part of a double bond, C1 is sp² hybridized, so it can't have four different substituents. So no chiral center here. So this compound is not optically active.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**
   Wow, that's a mouthful. Let's break it down. So this is a bicyclic compound, maybe with a bridge. The substituents include chloromethylene (Cl attached to a CH2 group, which is a substituent as a double bond perhaps). The stereochemistry is specified as E. Also, there are two stereocenters: 3aR and 7aS.

   So the question is whether this molecule has any chiral centers. If it has a bridge, perhaps some of the carbons are bridgeheads. Bridgehead carbons can sometimes be chiral if they have four different substituents.

   The molecule has a hexahydro ring system, so possibly a bicyclic system with two rings. The substituent is chloromethylene, which is Cl-CH2– attached probably as a double bond, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, no, chloromethylene would be Cl–CH2–, but in E configuration, perhaps it's a double bond.

   Wait, the substituent is 8-(chloromethylene), so maybe it's a double bond. So the substituent is CH2Cl. Wait, no, chloromethylene is CH2Cl, but if it's as a substituent on the bicyclic system, perhaps as a double bond. So maybe it's a double bond with Cl on one end and another group on the other. But regardless, the key part is the stereocenters.

   The molecule has two stereocenters: 3a and 7a. So it's a diastereomer. Are these stereocenters on bridgehead carbons? Because in some cases, bridgehead carbons can have limited rotation, but whether they're chiral depends on their substituents.

   For example, in norbornene derivatives, bridgehead carbons can sometimes be chiral. If 3a and 7a are bridgeheads, each with four different substituents, then they are chiral centers. So this molecule has two chiral centers. But wait, the question is whether it has optical activity. If the molecule is not meso, then it should be optically active.

   Wait, but the molecule has E configuration for the substituent. How does that affect chirality? The substituent's configuration could influence the overall structure, but if the molecule has two chiral centers, it's possible that it's a meso compound, making it achiral overall. But I'm not sure about that.

   Alternatively, if the molecule is not symmetric, then each chiral center would contribute to optical activity. But without knowing the exact structure, it's a bit tricky. But given that it's a complex bicyclic system, I think it's more likely that the molecule is not meso, so it would exhibit optical activity.

   So this compound is optically active. So count one.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**
   Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. When substituted with methyl groups on C2 and C3, the structure becomes HOOC-C*(CH3)-C*(CH3)-COOH. Each of these carbons (C2 and C3) have four substituents.

   For C2: attached groups are HOOC-, CH3, CH(CH3)COOH, and the adjacent C (but I think it's better to list the four substituents). Wait, C2 is connected to:
   - The succinic acid chain: so adjacent to a COOH group and a CH(CH3) group.
   - Two methyl groups? Wait no, 2,3-dimethyl would mean C2 has a methyl, and C3 has a methyl.

   Wait, succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So 2,3-dimethyl would be HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

   So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) have four substituents: for C2, substituents are CH3, CH(CH3) (from C3), the COOH group, and the other CH(CH3) from C2's two substituents. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

   Let me think again. The structure is:

   HOOC - C(CH3)(CH2CH2COOH) ?

   Wait no, succinic acid has four carbons: 1, 2, 3, 4. So 2 and 3 are the middle two. So 2 and 3 each have two CH3 groups? No, each has one CH3.

   So for C2: substituents are:
   - COOH (from C1)
   - CH(CH3) (from C3)
   - Two CH3 groups? No, wait, C2 is CH(CH3), so it's bonded to C1 (COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two CH3 groups? No, wait, C2 is CH(CH3), so it's connected to C1 (COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two CH3s? Or one CH3 and another group?

   Wait, no: succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. When you add methyl groups to C2 and C3, each of those carbons get a methyl. So C2 is CH(CH3), and C3 is CH(CH3). So for C2:

   - The groups are: COOH (from C1), CH(CH3) (from C3), CH3, and another group. Wait, what is the fourth group? Oh wait, C2 is connected to C1 (CH2, but with a methyl), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two CH3 groups? No, I think I'm getting stuck.

   Alternatively, perhaps it's better to check if either C2 or C3 is a chiral center. For a chiral center, four different groups must be attached.

   C2: attached groups would be:
   - COOH (from C1)
   - CH(CH3) (from C3)
   - Two methyl groups? No, because 2,3-dimethyl would mean each has one methyl.

   Wait, no. Let me think again. The structure of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each CH(CH3) is attached to:

   - The C1 (COOH)
   - The C3 (another CH(CH3))
   - Two CH3 groups? No, because each CH(CH3) has two CH3 groups? No, each has one CH3.

   Wait, no. Each of these carbons (C2 and C3) are each attached to a CH3 group and three other groups. Let's list the substituents for C2:

   C2: connected to:
   - C1 (which is OOC-)
   - C3 (which is CH(CH3))
   - Two CH3 groups? No, because each is only substituted once.

   Wait, no. Each of C2 and C3 has one CH3, and three other substituents. Wait, no. Let me think of the actual structure.

   Let me number the carbons:

   C1: COOH
   C2: CH(CH3)
   C3: CH(CH3)
   C4: COOH

   So C2 is connected to:
   - C1 (which is a COOH)
   - C3 (which is a CH(CH3))
   - Two CH3 groups? No, because each CH(CH3) has only one CH3 attached.

   Wait, no. Each CH(CH3) has one methyl group. So for C2:

   The substituents are:
   - COOH (from C1)
   - CH(CH3) (from C3)
   - Two CH2 groups? No, because it's a CH(CH3), which implies only one methyl.

   Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let's approach it differently. For a carbon to be chiral, it needs four distinct groups.

   C2 in 2R,3S-dimethylsuccinic acid: the substituents are:

   - COOH group (from C1)
   - CH(CH3) from C3
   - Two methyl groups? No, because each of C2 and C3 has only one methyl.

   Wait, I'm getting stuck. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that each of C2 and C3 has three substituents: one methyl, one COOH, and two CH2 groups?

   No, that's not right. Because in succinic acid, the chain is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. Adding a methyl to C2 and C3 would make them CH(CH3). So each of those carbons is CH(CH3)-, connected to two CH2 groups (the chain on either side), a methyl, and a COOH.

   Wait, no, C2 is connected to C1 (COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two CH3 groups? No, that's not correct. Because each CH(CH3) only has one CH3.

   Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the substituents on C2. C2 has:

   - One COOH group (from C1)
   - One CH(CH3) (from C3)
   - Two CH3 groups? No, because each CH(CH3) has only one methyl.

   Wait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me count. In the molecule HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH, each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) is bonded to:

   C2: attached groups are:
   - COOH (from C1)
   - CH(CH3) (from C3)
   - Two methyl groups? No, that can't be. Because each CH(CH3) only has one methyl. So wait, maybe one methyl and three other substituents.

   So, C2 has: COOH, CH(CH3), two other substituents. Wait, no, the other substituents are the two adjacent carbons (C1 and C3) and the methyl. Wait, no, each of C2 and C3 is CH(CH3), so they're connected to two other carbons (C1 and C3 for C2; C2 and C4 for C3), a methyl, and a hydrogen? No, wait, no hydrogen. Because it's CH(CH3) implies that the carbon has two other substituents besides the methyl and the adjacent carbons.

   Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let's try this another way: the molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

   For C2: the substituents are:
   - The COOH group (from C1)
   - The CH(CH3) from C3
   - Two methyl groups? No, because each CH(CH3) only has one methyl. So, no, C2 has substituents: COOH (C1), CH(CH3) (C3), CH3, and what's the fourth?

   Wait, maybe I'm missing something. The C2 in this structure is CH(CH3), so it's connected to C1 (COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two CH3 groups? No, that doesn't make sense because each CH(CH3) only has one methyl.

   Oh wait, perhaps I was wrong and each C2 and C3 is actually attached to two methyl groups. If the structure is HOOC-C(CH3)2-CH(CH3)2-COOH, but that's not what the name says. The name says 2,3-dimethyl, meaning each has one methyl.

   Hmm, perhaps I should consider that each of C2 and C3 is attached to a methyl, and the other substituents are the two adjacent carbons and a hydrogen. But that would make them CH(CH3) groups, which have three substituents: two from the chain and one methyl. So each has three substituents, but we need four for a chiral center.

   Wait, that can't be. If each of the middle carbons is CH(CH3), then each has three substituents: two from the chain (C1 and C3) and one methyl. So they can't be chiral centers because they don't have four different groups. So maybe this compound does not have any chiral centers, making it achiral. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the compound is named with R and S configurations, implying stereocenters.

   Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me think again. If the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH, then each of C2 and C3 has:

   - C1: COOH
   - C3: CH(CH3)
   - CH3
   - And maybe another substituent? Or is that all?

   No, because each carbon has four bonds. So for C2, the four bonds are:

   1. To C1 (COOH)
   2. To C3 (CH(CH3))
   3. One CH3
   4. One hydrogen?

   Oh wait, no. Because in the structure, the carbons are CH(CH3), which would have a hydrogen. So for C2, substituents are: COOH (C1), CH(CH3) (C3), CH3, and H. So four different groups? Let's see: COOH is one, CH(CH3) is another (but wait, isn't that the same as C3's substituent?), no, because it's attached to C3 which is a different carbon.

   Wait, let me get this straight. C2's substituents are:

   - The COOH group (from C1)
   - The CH(CH3) group (from C3)
   - A methyl (CH3)
   - A hydrogen (H)

   So four different substituents: COOH, CH(CH3) (C3), CH3, and H. So yes, C2 is a chiral center. Similarly, C3 would also have four different substituents.

   So each of C2 and C3 are chiral centers. Now, the question is whether the molecule is a meso compound. If the two stereocenters make the molecule achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry, then it's meso and not optically active.

   So the molecule would be meso if the configuration at C2 and C3 are such that there's a plane of symmetry. For example, if one is R and the other is S in a way that creates symmetry.

   The given compound is (2R,3S). So let's imagine the molecule: the two chiral centers are R and S. Now, is there a plane of symmetry between them? If the molecule is symmetric, perhaps when you switch the configurations, it becomes the same.

   Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a meso compound because of the arrangement. Let me think: if the two chiral centers are on adjacent carbons and have opposite configurations, could the molecule be meso?

   Wait, for meso compounds, the molecule must have an internal plane of symmetry, making it achiral despite having stereocenters. For example, tartaric acid is a meso compound when the configurations are R and S on adjacent carbons.

   So in this case, with 2R and 3S, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3, then it's meso and not optically active. But wait, in succinic acid, if the two chiral centers are on adjacent carbons, then the molecule might be a meso form.

   So if 2R and 3S, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it meso. Because flipping the molecule along that plane would map it onto itself. Therefore, it's achiral, despite having two stereocenters. So this compound would not exhibit optical activity.

   Alternatively, if the configurations were both R or both S, then it would be a chiral molecule, so it would be optically active. But in this case, since it's 2R and 3S, the molecule is meso, so it's not optically active.

   Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think of the structure. 2R,3S would have the substituents arranged such that the methyl groups are on opposite sides? Maybe. If the molecule is symmetric, then yes, it's meso.

   So I think this compound is a meso compound and thus is achiral. So no optical activity.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**
   So similar to the previous compound, but now both stereocenters are R. So the configurations are (2R,3R).

   Let's think about the molecule: HOOC-CH(CH3)(R)-CH(CH3)(R)-COOH.

   Are there any planes of symmetry in this molecule? If both chiral centers are R, then the molecule would not be symmetric. Because having both R configurations would mean the substituents are arranged in a way that lacks a plane of symmetry.

   Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can have a plane of symmetry if the substituents are arranged appropriately. But in this case, with both R, I don't think so.

   So this molecule has two chiral centers, and no plane of symmetry making it meso. Therefore, it's chiral and optically active. So this counts as one.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**
   This is a cyclohexene ring with an alcohol group at position 1, and the substituents are in the R configuration.

   Let's think about the structure. The cyclohexene ring has a double bond between C3 and C4 (since it's cyclohex-3-en-1-ol). The OH group is on C1.

   So, is there a chiral center here? The OH is on C1, which is attached to the cyclohexene ring. The ring is sp² hybridized at C3 and C4. So C1 is attached to:

   - The cyclohexene ring (which includes substituents from adjacent carbons)
   - -OH
   - Two other substituents.

   Wait, but in a cyclohexene ring, each carbon is connected to two other carbons in the ring. So C1 is connected to C2 and C6 in the ring. So substituents on C1 would be:

   - OH
   - The ring (so C2 and C6)
   - And possibly a hydrogen or another substituent.

   Wait, the structure of cyclohex-3-en-1-ol would have the ring with a double bond between C3 and C4. So C1 has an OH group, C2, C6, and perhaps a hydrogen.

   So the substituents on C1 are:

   - OH
   - C2 (which is part of the ring)
   - C6 (another part of the ring)
   - And a hydrogen.

   Wait, but wait, in a cyclohexene, each carbon in the ring is bonded to two adjacent carbons. So C1 is bonded to C2 and C6, and has two more substituents. Oh wait, no. Since it's cyclohexene, it's a six-membered ring, so each carbon is bonded to two adjacent carbons and two other substituents.

   Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Each carbon in a cyclohexene ring is bonded to two adjacent carbons and two other groups. If the ring has a double bond (like between C3 and C4), then those two carbons are sp² hybridized and each have two substituents besides the double bond.

   For C1, which is where the OH is attached, it's a single-bonded carbon in the ring. So the substituents on C1 are:

   - OH
   - C2
   - C6
   - And a hydrogen? Or maybe another substituent.

   Wait, in cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the structure is:

   O
   || 
   C1-OH
      \
       C2 – C3=C4 – C5 – C6 – C1

   So C1 is connected to C2 and C6, and has an OH and a hydrogen. So substituents on C1 are: OH, C2, C6, and H.

   So four substituents. Are any of them identical? Let's see: C2 and C6 are different parts of the ring. C2 is next to C1 and C3, while C6 is next to C1 and C5. But in terms of substituents, they're not identical. So C1 has four different substituents:

   - OH
   - C2 (which is connected to C1 and C3)
   - C6 (connected to C1 and C5)
   - H

   So yes, C1 is a chiral center. Therefore, this compound is chiral and optically active.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**
   This is a cyclohexane ring with three OH groups at positions 1, 3, and 5, all in the s configuration.

   So, each of these carbons (C1, C3, C5) has an OH group. Let's check each for chirality.

   Take C1: it's attached to C2 and C6 in the ring, has an OH group, and a hydrogen. So substituents are:

   - OH
   - C2
   - C6
   - H

   Are these all different? C2 and C6 are different parts of the ring, so substituents are OH, C2, C6, H. So four different groups. So C1 is a chiral center.

   Similarly, C3 and C5 would each be chiral centers as well. But wait, we have to think about the symmetry of the molecule. If all three OH groups are in the same configuration (s), does that make the molecule symmetric?

   The molecule is (1s,3s,5s), which means each of these carbons has the same configuration. So looking at the cyclohexane ring, if you have OH groups at 1,3,5 positions, and all are s, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry.

   Wait, let me visualize this. Imagine a cyclohexane ring with OH groups at positions 1,3,5. If all are s, perhaps the molecule is symmetric. Because if you rotate the molecule 120 degrees, each OH would be in a position that's symmetric.

   Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the center of the ring, making it meso. For example, if there's a plane that makes each OH on the same side, then the molecule would be achiral.

   Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the three stereocenters don't allow for a plane of symmetry. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think: in a cyclohexane ring with three substituents at 1,3,5 positions, if all substituents are the same (like OH) and in the same configuration, the molecule could be symmetric.

   Wait, but if all three are same configuration, like all R or all S, but in a way that the molecule is not symmetric. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the arrangement of substituents leads to the molecule being meso.

   Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a center of inversion, making it achiral. For example, if the configuration is such that each substituent is mirrored across the center, then it's a meso compound.

   Alternatively, perhaps each substituent is arranged in a way that when you look from the top, the OH groups are on the same face, leading to a symmetric structure.

   Alternatively, maybe this molecule is a meso compound because of the arrangement of substituents. If the three substituents are arranged symmetrically, the molecule could be achiral.

   Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think of another example. For example, a cyclohexane with three substituents at 1,3,5 positions could be a meso compound if the substituents are arranged symmetrically. So if the substituents are all the same and arranged in a way that flipping the molecule over leaves it unchanged, then it's a meso compound.

   For (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol, perhaps the molecule is meso. Because the substituents are arranged symmetrically, making the molecule achiral. But I'm not entirely confident.

   Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not meso. If all three OH groups are in the same configuration, but in a way that doesn't produce a plane of symmetry, then the molecule would be chiral and optically active.

   Hmm. I'm a bit stuck on this one. Let me think of another approach. If the molecule has three chiral centers, but the molecule is symmetric, then it's a meso compound. For example, if you can draw a plane that reflects the molecule onto itself, making it achiral despite having multiple stereocenters.

   Alternatively, maybe the molecule isn't symmetric. Let me imagine the molecule: cyclohexane with OH groups at 1,3,5. If all are s (say, all pointing in the same direction, either all up or all down), the molecule could be symmetric. For example, if you have a plane going through the center, the substituents on opposite sides would mirror each other.

   So, perhaps the molecule is meso. If that's the case, it's achiral and not optically active. Alternatively, if it's not symmetric, then it would be chiral.

   Wait, but I'm not certain. Another way to think: if the molecule has an even number of stereocenters, it's more likely to be meso, but here we have three. Hmm.

   Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the three stereocenters break any possible symmetry. So the molecule has no plane of symmetry and thus is chiral.

   I'm not entirely sure, but I'll tentatively say this molecule is chiral and optically active. So I'll count this as one.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**
   Structure: cyclopentyl group attached to C1 of a butanone (butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CO). So the structure would be cyclopentyl-CO-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3).

   Wait, but butan-1-one is CH3-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, butan-1-one is actually:

   O
   || 
   C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3

   So, butan-1-one would be pentan-2-one? No, I'm getting confused. Wait, butan-1-one would be:

   CH2-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3? No, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. Butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CO, but wait, butan-1-one is CH2CH2CH2COCH3? No, wait, butanone is usually (CH3)2CO (acetone, propan-2-one), or CH3CH2COCH3 (butan-2-one), or CH3CH2CH2COCH3 (pentan-2-one).

   Wait, but the question says butan-1-one. So that's a four-carbon chain with the ketone at position 1. So structure:

   O
   || 
   C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3

   So, it's pentan-1-one? Or butan-1-one would be four carbons, so:

   O
   ||
   C-CH2-CH2-CH2-

   Which would be (CH2)3-CO, but that's a four-carbon chain? Wait, butan-1-one would be:

   O
   ||
   C-CH2-CH2-CH2-

   Wait, that can't be, because butan-1-one would have four carbons in total. So:

   O
   ||
   C-CH2-CH2-CH2-

   No, that's not possible. Wait, butan-1-one is a four-carbon compound with the carbonyl group at position 1. So structure would be:

   O
   ||
   C-CH2-CH2-CH2-

   But that's a three-carbon chain after the carbonyl. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Alternatively, perhaps butan-1-one is:

   O

   C-CH2-CH2-CH3

   So that's a four-carbon chain, but the carbonyl is on the first carbon. So, the structure is (CH2)3CO, but that would be a four-carbon chain. Hmm, perhaps it's more accurately written as (CH2)3CO, but I'm not entirely sure.

   Anyway, regardless of the exact structure, the key is to look for chiral centers.

   The compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So the carbonyl is on C1, which is connected to a cyclopentyl group. C3 has a methyl group.

   Let me draw this out:

   C1: carbonyl (O)
   C2: connected to C1 and C3
   C3: connected to C2, C4, and a methyl group
   C4: connected to C3 and possibly a CH3

   Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

   Cyclopentyl group attached to C1 (the carbonyl carbon), then the chain goes C1-CO-C2-CH2-C3-CH(CH3)-C4? No, perhaps not.

   Wait, butan-1-one is:

   O
   ||
   C-CH2-CH2-CH2-

   So butan-1-one would have a four-carbon chain, with the carbonyl on C1. So:

   O
   ||
   C1 - C2 - C3 - C4

   So C1 is carbonyl, C2 is CH2, C3 is CH2, C4 is CH3.

   So butan-1-one is (CH2)3CO.

   So in 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, the substituents are:

   - C1 (carbonyl) is attached to cyclopentyl group and the rest of the chain.

   So the structure would be:

   O
   ||
   C1 (cyclopentyl) - C2 - C3 (CH(CH3)) - C4

   So, let's look for chiral centers.

   The carbonyl is on C1, so it's sp² hybridized. C3 is CH(CH3), so it's connected to:

   - C2
   - C4
   - CH3
   - And another group.

   Wait, but C3 would have four substituents? Let me see.

   C3 is connected to C2 (CH2), C4 (CH2), a methyl group (CH3), and possibly a hydrogen.

   Wait, no. Let me re-examine:

   The structure is:

   O
   ||
   C1 (cyclopentyl) - C2 (CH2) - C3 (CH(CH3)) - C4 (CH3)

   So, C3 has:

   - C2 (CH2)
   - C4 (CH3)
   - CH3 (methyl)
   - And a hydrogen.

   So, substituents on C3 are: CH2 (from C2), CH3 (from C4), CH3 (methyl), and H.

   Wait, two CH3 groups and a CH2 and H. So substituents on C3 are:

   - CH2- (from C2)
   - CH3 (from C4)
   - CH3 (methyl)
   - H

   So, four substituents, but two are CH3. So two substituents are the same (CH3 groups), so C3 is not a chiral center because it doesn't have four different groups.

   Are there any other chiral centers in the molecule?

   C2: connected to C1 (cyclopentyl and carbonyl), C3, and two CH2 groups. So substituents are: C1, C3, CH2, CH2. So no, not a chiral center.

   C4: connected to C3, and three CH3 groups? No, C4 is at the end, so it's CH3. So no chiral center there.

   Wait, but what about the cyclopentyl group? The cyclopentane ring is attached to C1. Could any of the carbons in the cyclopentyl group be a chiral center?

   The cyclopentane ring is connected to C1, which is a carbonyl group. So the cyclopentyl group is attached as a substituent. The cyclopentane ring itself is a five-membered ring, and each carbon in the ring is connected to two adjacent carbons and two substituents.

   The substitution on the cyclopentane would depend on how it's attached. But unless one of the carbons in the ring has four different substituents, it won't be a chiral center.

   In this case, the cyclopentane is attached to C1 via one of its carbons. Let's say that carbon (C1 of cyclopentane) is connected to:

   - Two adjacent ring carbons
   - The carbonyl carbon (C1 of butanone)
   - And another substituent, perhaps a hydrogen.

   So substituents on C1 of cyclopentane are:

   - Two adjacent ring carbons (from the cyclopentane ring)
   - C1 of butanone
   - H

   So four substituents. Are they all different? The two adjacent carbons are part of the ring and identical in structure, so substituents from the ring would be same on each side, making the substituents on C1 of cyclopentane not all different.

   Therefore, C1 of cyclopentane is not a chiral center.

   So, the entire molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, so it's not optically active.

   Wait, but wait. Another possibility is that the cyclopentyl group itself is substituted in a way that creates a chiral center. Let me think: if the cyclopentane ring has substituents that make one of its carbons a chiral center.

   But in this case, the substituents on the cyclopentane would be:

   - The point of attachment to the butanone (C1)
   - Two adjacent CH2 groups (from the cyclopentane ring)
   - And possibly a hydrogen or another substituent.

   So unless the cyclopentane has substituents other than hydrogens, it's unlikely to have a chiral center.

   Therefore, the compound has no chiral centers, so it's not optically active.

Now, let me recap each compound:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene → No chiral center → Not active.
2. (3aR,7aS,E)-... → Has two stereocenters, not meso → Optically active.
3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid → Meso compound → Not active.
4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid → Not meso, two stereocenters → Active.
5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol → One chiral center → Active.
6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol → Possibly a meso compound → Not active? Or maybe it is chiral. Wait, earlier I was unsure. Let me reevaluate.
   Oh wait, if all three OHs are in the same configuration (s), the molecule might not be symmetric. For example, if the OHs are all on the same face, the molecule could be chiral. Alternatively, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it could be meso. Hmm.

   Let me think: cyclohexane with three substituents at 1,3,5 positions. If all substituents are same and on the same face, the molecule could have a three-fold symmetry, but no plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

   Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged such that each is opposite another, making the molecule symmetric. But with three substituents, it's tough to have such symmetry.

   Wait, three substituents at 1,3,5 positions would create a trigonal symmetry. So perhaps the molecule is symmetric, making it a meso compound.

   But I'm not entirely sure. So perhaps this compound is meso and not active. But I'm not confident.

   Alternatively, perhaps the molecule isn't a meso compound because the arrangement of the substituents doesn't allow for a plane of symmetry. If all three OHs are on the same face, the molecule could have a plane of symmetry, making it meso.

   For example, if the substituents are all axial or all equatorial, that might create a symmetric arrangement.

   Alternatively, perhaps the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

   I'm still uncertain, but perhaps I should mark this as not active since I'm more confident about the other compounds.

   Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not symmetric, so it's active. I'm torn.

   Let me make a decision: I think that (1s,3s,5s) configuration would result in a symmetric molecule, making it a meso compound and not optically active.

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one → No chiral centers → Not active.

So, counting the active compounds:

Compound 2: active
4: active
5: active
Others: not active except possibly 6, but I'm not confident.

Wait, earlier I thought compound 6 is a meso and not active. So:

Active compounds are 2,4,5. That's three. But wait, let me recount.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me go through each again:

1. Not active.
2. Active → count 1.
3. Not active.
4. Active → count 2.
5. Active → count 3.
6. Not active.
7. Not active.

So three compounds are active.

But wait, the options don't have three as the answer. Let me check the options.

Options are:
A)5
B)3
C)2
D)4

Wait, I thought three are active.

But wait, let me re-examine compound 6.

(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol.

If the molecule has three chiral centers, and if it's symmetric, it could be a meso compound, making it not active. Alternatively, if it's not symmetric, it's active.

I'm not confident, but perhaps it's better to assume it's active. Let me think again.

If the three OHs are in the same configuration (s), but their positions are 1,3,5, which are symmetric. So the molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound.

Wait, for example, if the OHs are all in the same configuration and equally spaced, the molecule could be symmetric.

So, perhaps in this case, (1s,3s,5s) leads to a meso compound, making it not active.

So, then, the active compounds are 2,4,5.

That's three. So the answer would be option B)3.

Wait, but the options say:

A)5

B)3

C)2

D)4

So the correct answer would be B)3.

But wait, I thought that compound 6 is not active, but perhaps I was wrong. Let me reconsider.

Another approach: for a molecule to be meso, it must have at least two stereocenters and an internal plane of symmetry. But if it has three stereocenters, it's possible to be meso, but less common.

In the case of (1s,3s,5s), perhaps the molecule is chiral because the arrangement of the substituents doesn't allow for a plane of symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not symmetric, making it chiral.

Wait, but how can a molecule with an odd number of substituents be symmetric? For example, three substituents at 1,3,5 positions in a cyclohexane would have a trigonal arrangement, which is symmetric.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not symmetric, and thus is chiral.

In that case, compound 6 would be optically active, adding one more to the count.

So if I'm wrong earlier, and compound 6 is active, then the active compounds are 2,4,5,6 → four in total.

But earlier, I thought compound 6 is not active.

Alternatively, perhaps I should reevaluate.

Wait, the molecule is (1s,3s,5s). Let's imagine that each of these positions has an OH group, all in the s (say, left-handed) configuration.

If the molecule is symmetric upon a 120-degree rotation, it might be achiral. But wait, a 120-degree rotation would not be a symmetry operation.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a center of inversion, making it symmetric.

Wait, another approach: imagine looking at the cyclohexane ring with substituents at 1,3,5. If each substituent is in the same configuration, and the substituents are arranged such that each has a mirror image across the center, then the molecule would be meso.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are all on the same face, making the molecule symmetric. For example, all axial or all equatorial.

If all three substituents are on the same face, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. So the molecule would be meso and not active.

Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a way that no plane of symmetry exists, the molecule would be chiral.

I'm still not certain, but perhaps the (1s,3s,5s) configuration is a meso form, making it not active.

So, sticking with three active compounds: 2,4,5.

But wait, let me think again. Wait, compound 6: if all three OH groups are on the same face, would that give the molecule a plane of symmetry?

In a cyclohexane ring, if substituents are at 1,3,5 positions and all are axial, that would create a symmetric structure. So perhaps the molecule is symmetric and thus a meso compound.

If that's the case, then compound 6 is not active.

So the total active compounds are:

2: active

4: active

5: active

Total of three.

Looking at the answer options, option B is 3.

Alternatively, but what about the (3aR,7aS,E) compound? Let me think again.

Compound 2: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione.

This is a complex bicyclic structure. If it has two stereocenters and isn't a meso compound, it would be active.

Assuming it's not a meso, which is likely due to the complex structure, it's active.

So, I think the correct count is three active compounds: 2,4,5.

Therefore, the answer is B)3.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality. A compound is optically active if it has at least one chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) and is not a meso compound (a compound with multiple stereocenters that is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry).

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**  
   This compound is an alkene with no chiral centers. The carbon atoms in the double bond are sp² hybridized and cannot have four different substituents.  
   **Not optically active.**

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**  
   This is a complex bicyclic compound with two stereocenters (3aR and 7aS). The molecule is not symmetric and does not form a meso compound.  
   **Optically active.**

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   This compound has two chiral centers (C2 and C3). However, due to the arrangement of the substituents, the molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound.  
   **Not optically active.**

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   This compound also has two chiral centers (C2 and C3). Unlike the (2R,3S) isomer, this compound does not have an internal plane of symmetry and is not a meso compound.  
   **Optically active.**

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**  
   This compound has a chiral center at C1, where the substituents are -OH, -C2 (part of the cyclohexene ring), -C6 (part of the cyclohexene ring), and a hydrogen. All four substituents are different.  
   **Optically active.**

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**  
   This compound has three chiral centers (C1, C3, and C5) with hydroxyl groups in the (s) configuration. The molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound.  
   **Not optically active.**

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**  
   This compound does not have any chiral centers. The carbonyl carbon (C1) is sp² hybridized, and the other carbons do not have four different substituents.  
   **Not optically active.**

### Conclusion:
The compounds that exhibit optical activity are:  
- **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**  
- **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
- **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**  

Thus, **three compounds are optically active**.

**Answer: B**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in organic compounds. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through each compound one by one.

Optical activity usually comes from having chiral centers, right? But wait, there's also the possibility of other factors like meso compounds or maybe some kind of symmetry that could affect it. Let me remember: a chiral center is a carbon attached to four different groups. If a compound has at least one chiral center, it can be optically active unless it's a meso compound, which has multiple chiral centers but is superimposable on its mirror image, so it's achiral.

So, I'll go through each compound given and check for these factors.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
   Hmm, this is an alkene with a chloro group and a methyl on the same carbon (but-1-ene). The Z configuration means the higher priority groups are on the same side. But wait, I'm trying to see if there's a chiral center here. The structure would be Cl attached to C1, which is also bonded to the double bond (C2). So C1 has Cl, maybe two CH2 groups or something? Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but here it's 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure is Cl-C(=CH2-CH2CH3)-CH2? Wait, maybe I'm getting mixed up.

   Alternatively, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. Substituting at 1 gives Cl and the double bond on C1. So structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double-bonded to C2. So the substituents on C1 are Cl, CH2CH2CH3 (as from the double bond), and two other groups? Wait, no—since it's but-1-ene, it's CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would make it Cl-CH2-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, but that's not correct. Wait, but in but-1-ene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So 1-chloro is Cl on C1. So structure is Cl-CH2-CH2CH2CH3? But that doesn't sound right because but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be CH2Cl-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2Cl connected to a double bond. Oh, wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would have a Cl on C1 and a methyl on C2. So the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So C1: Cl, CH2CH2CH3 (from double bond), maybe another substituent? Wait, but the structure would be Cl–C(CH2CH2CH3)=CH(CH3)? Hmm, maybe not.

   Wait, perhaps it's easier to look for possible chiral centers. C1 has Cl, double bond, and two other substituents. So for C1: attached groups are Cl, CH2CH2CH3 (from the double bond), and the adjacent C (which is connected to a methyl). Wait, no, the structure is Cl-C(=CH(CH3))–CH2CH3. So C1 is attached to Cl, the double bond (so two substituents from the double bond?), and maybe another CH2 group? I'm getting a bit stuck here.

   Alternatively, maybe the molecule is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. C2 has a methyl group and perhaps another substituent. Let me try to draw it: C1 is Cl–C(=CH(CH3))–CH2CH3. So C1 is connected to Cl, two CH2 groups (from the double bond ends), and the C2 which has a methyl. Wait, no, but C1 is connected via double bond to C2, so C1 has Cl, CH2CH3, and the double bond to C2. So C1 has three groups: Cl, CH2CH3, and the double bond (so maybe that's a double bond substituent, which would count as a substituent group? Or maybe not, since it's part of the double bond structure.)

   Oh wait, maybe there's no chiral center here. Because if C1 is connected to Cl, two CH2 groups, and the double bond, then it's not a chiral center. Because being part of a double bond, C1 is sp² hybridized, so it can't have four different substituents. So no chiral center here. So this compound is not optically active.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**
   Wow, that's a mouthful. Let's break it down. So this is a bicyclic compound, maybe with a bridge. The substituents include chloromethylene (Cl attached to a CH2 group, which is a substituent as a double bond perhaps). The stereochemistry is specified as E. Also, there are two stereocenters: 3aR and 7aS.

   So the question is whether this molecule has any chiral centers. If it has a bridge, perhaps some of the carbons are bridgeheads. Bridgehead carbons can sometimes be chiral if they have four different substituents.

   The molecule has a hexahydro ring system, so possibly a bicyclic system with two rings. The substituent is chloromethylene, which is Cl-CH2– attached probably as a double bond, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, no, chloromethylene would be Cl–CH2–, but in E configuration, perhaps it's a double bond.

   Wait, the substituent is 8-(chloromethylene), so maybe it's a double bond. So the substituent is CH2Cl. Wait, no, chloromethylene is CH2Cl, but if it's as a substituent on the bicyclic system, perhaps as a double bond. So maybe it's a double bond with Cl on one end and another group on the other. But regardless, the key part is the stereocenters.

   The molecule has two stereocenters: 3a and 7a. So it's a diastereomer. Are these stereocenters on bridgehead carbons? Because in some cases, bridgehead carbons can have limited rotation, but whether they're chiral depends on their substituents.

   For example, in norbornene derivatives, bridgehead carbons can sometimes be chiral. If 3a and 7a are bridgeheads, each with four different substituents, then they are chiral centers. So this molecule has two chiral centers. But wait, the question is whether it has optical activity. If the molecule is not meso, then it should be optically active.

   Wait, but the molecule has E configuration for the substituent. How does that affect chirality? The substituent's configuration could influence the overall structure, but if the molecule has two chiral centers, it's possible that it's a meso compound, making it achiral overall. But I'm not sure about that.

   Alternatively, if the molecule is not symmetric, then each chiral center would contribute to optical activity. But without knowing the exact structure, it's a bit tricky. But given that it's a complex bicyclic system, I think it's more likely that the molecule is not meso, so it would exhibit optical activity.

   So this compound is optically active. So count one.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**
   Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. When substituted with methyl groups on C2 and C3, the structure becomes HOOC-C*(CH3)-C*(CH3)-COOH. Each of these carbons (C2 and C3) have four substituents.

   For C2: attached groups are HOOC-, CH3, CH(CH3)COOH, and the adjacent C (but I think it's better to list the four substituents). Wait, C2 is connected to:
   - The succinic acid chain: so adjacent to a COOH group and a CH(CH3) group.
   - Two methyl groups? Wait no, 2,3-dimethyl would mean C2 has a methyl, and C3 has a methyl.

   Wait, succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So 2,3-dimethyl would be HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

   So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) have four substituents: for C2, substituents are CH3, CH(CH3) (from C3), the COOH group, and the other CH(CH3) from C2's two substituents. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

   Let me think again. The structure is:

   HOOC - C(CH3)(CH2CH2COOH) ?

   Wait no, succinic acid has four carbons: 1, 2, 3, 4. So 2 and 3 are the middle two. So 2 and 3 each have two CH3 groups? No, each has one CH3.

   So for C2: substituents are:
   - COOH (from C1)
   - CH(CH3) (from C3)
   - Two CH3 groups? No, wait, C2 is CH(CH3), so it's bonded to C1 (COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two CH3 groups? No, wait, C2 is CH(CH3), so it's connected to C1 (COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two CH3s? Or one CH3 and another group?

   Wait, no: succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. When you add methyl groups to C2 and C3, each of those carbons get a methyl. So C2 is CH(CH3), and C3 is CH(CH3). So for C2:

   - The groups are: COOH (from C1), CH(CH3) (from C3), CH3, and another group. Wait, what is the fourth group? Oh wait, C2 is connected to C1 (CH2, but with a methyl), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two CH3 groups? No, I think I'm getting stuck.

   Alternatively, perhaps it's better to check if either C2 or C3 is a chiral center. For a chiral center, four different groups must be attached.

   C2: attached groups would be:
   - COOH (from C1)
   - CH(CH3) (from C3)
   - Two methyl groups? No, because 2,3-dimethyl would mean each has one methyl.

   Wait, no. Let me think again. The structure of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each CH(CH3) is attached to:

   - The C1 (COOH)
   - The C3 (another CH(CH3))
   - Two CH3 groups? No, because each CH(CH3) has two CH3 groups? No, each has one CH3.

   Wait, no. Each of these carbons (C2 and C3) are each attached to a CH3 group and three other groups. Let's list the substituents for C2:

   C2: connected to:
   - C1 (which is OOC-)
   - C3 (which is CH(CH3))
   - Two CH3 groups? No, because each is only substituted once.

   Wait, no. Each of C2 and C3 has one CH3, and three other substituents. Wait, no. Let me think of the actual structure.

   Let me number the carbons:

   C1: COOH
   C2: CH(CH3)
   C3: CH(CH3)
   C4: COOH

   So C2 is connected to:
   - C1 (which is a COOH)
   - C3 (which is a CH(CH3))
   - Two CH3 groups? No, because each CH(CH3) has only one CH3 attached.

   Wait, no. Each CH(CH3) has one methyl group. So for C2:

   The substituents are:
   - COOH (from C1)
   - CH(CH3) (from C3)
   - Two CH2 groups? No, because it's a CH(CH3), which implies only one methyl.

   Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let's approach it differently. For a carbon to be chiral, it needs four distinct groups.

   C2 in 2R,3S-dimethylsuccinic acid: the substituents are:

   - COOH group (from C1)
   - CH(CH3) from C3
   - Two methyl groups? No, because each of C2 and C3 has only one methyl.

   Wait, I'm getting stuck. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that each of C2 and C3 has three substituents: one methyl, one COOH, and two CH2 groups?

   No, that's not right. Because in succinic acid, the chain is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. Adding a methyl to C2 and C3 would make them CH(CH3). So each of those carbons is CH(CH3)-, connected to two CH2 groups (the chain on either side), a methyl, and a COOH.

   Wait, no, C2 is connected to C1 (COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two CH3 groups? No, that's not correct. Because each CH(CH3) only has one CH3.

   Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the substituents on C2. C2 has:

   - One COOH group (from C1)
   - One CH(CH3) (from C3)
   - Two CH3 groups? No, because each CH(CH3) has only one methyl.

   Wait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me count. In the molecule HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH, each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) is bonded to:

   C2: attached groups are:
   - COOH (from C1)
   - CH(CH3) (from C3)
   - Two methyl groups? No, that can't be. Because each CH(CH3) only has one methyl. So wait, maybe one methyl and three other substituents.

   So, C2 has: COOH, CH(CH3), two other substituents. Wait, no, the other substituents are the two adjacent carbons (C1 and C3) and the methyl. Wait, no, each of C2 and C3 is CH(CH3), so they're connected to two other carbons (C1 and C3 for C2; C2 and C4 for C3), a methyl, and a hydrogen? No, wait, no hydrogen. Because it's CH(CH3) implies that the carbon has two other substituents besides the methyl and the adjacent carbons.

   Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let's try this another way: the molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

   For C2: the substituents are:
   - The COOH group (from C1)
   - The CH(CH3) from C3
   - Two methyl groups? No, because each CH(CH3) only has one methyl. So, no, C2 has substituents: COOH (C1), CH(CH3) (C3), CH3, and what's the fourth?

   Wait, maybe I'm missing something. The C2 in this structure is CH(CH3), so it's connected to C1 (COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two CH3 groups? No, that doesn't make sense because each CH(CH3) only has one methyl.

   Oh wait, perhaps I was wrong and each C2 and C3 is actually attached to two methyl groups. If the structure is HOOC-C(CH3)2-CH(CH3)2-COOH, but that's not what the name says. The name says 2,3-dimethyl, meaning each has one methyl.

   Hmm, perhaps I should consider that each of C2 and C3 is attached to a methyl, and the other substituents are the two adjacent carbons and a hydrogen. But that would make them CH(CH3) groups, which have three substituents: two from the chain and one methyl. So each has three substituents, but we need four for a chiral center.

   Wait, that can't be. If each of the middle carbons is CH(CH3), then each has three substituents: two from the chain (C1 and C3) and one methyl. So they can't be chiral centers because they don't have four different groups. So maybe this compound does not have any chiral centers, making it achiral. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the compound is named with R and S configurations, implying stereocenters.

   Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me think again. If the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH, then each of C2 and C3 has:

   - C1: COOH
   - C3: CH(CH3)
   - CH3
   - And maybe another substituent? Or is that all?

   No, because each carbon has four bonds. So for C2, the four bonds are:

   1. To C1 (COOH)
   2. To C3 (CH(CH3))
   3. One CH3
   4. One hydrogen?

   Oh wait, no. Because in the structure, the carbons are CH(CH3), which would have a hydrogen. So for C2, substituents are: COOH (C1), CH(CH3) (C3), CH3, and H. So four different groups? Let's see: COOH is one, CH(CH3) is another (but wait, isn't that the same as C3's substituent?), no, because it's attached to C3 which is a different carbon.

   Wait, let me get this straight. C2's substituents are:

   - The COOH group (from C1)
   - The CH(CH3) group (from C3)
   - A methyl (CH3)
   - A hydrogen (H)

   So four different substituents: COOH, CH(CH3) (C3), CH3, and H. So yes, C2 is a chiral center. Similarly, C3 would also have four different substituents.

   So each of C2 and C3 are chiral centers. Now, the question is whether the molecule is a meso compound. If the two stereocenters make the molecule achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry, then it's meso and not optically active.

   So the molecule would be meso if the configuration at C2 and C3 are such that there's a plane of symmetry. For example, if one is R and the other is S in a way that creates symmetry.

   The given compound is (2R,3S). So let's imagine the molecule: the two chiral centers are R and S. Now, is there a plane of symmetry between them? If the molecule is symmetric, perhaps when you switch the configurations, it becomes the same.

   Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a meso compound because of the arrangement. Let me think: if the two chiral centers are on adjacent carbons and have opposite configurations, could the molecule be meso?

   Wait, for meso compounds, the molecule must have an internal plane of symmetry, making it achiral despite having stereocenters. For example, tartaric acid is a meso compound when the configurations are R and S on adjacent carbons.

   So in this case, with 2R and 3S, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3, then it's meso and not optically active. But wait, in succinic acid, if the two chiral centers are on adjacent carbons, then the molecule might be a meso form.

   So if 2R and 3S, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it meso. Because flipping the molecule along that plane would map it onto itself. Therefore, it's achiral, despite having two stereocenters. So this compound would not exhibit optical activity.

   Alternatively, if the configurations were both R or both S, then it would be a chiral molecule, so it would be optically active. But in this case, since it's 2R and 3S, the molecule is meso, so it's not optically active.

   Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think of the structure. 2R,3S would have the substituents arranged such that the methyl groups are on opposite sides? Maybe. If the molecule is symmetric, then yes, it's meso.

   So I think this compound is a meso compound and thus is achiral. So no optical activity.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**
   So similar to the previous compound, but now both stereocenters are R. So the configurations are (2R,3R).

   Let's think about the molecule: HOOC-CH(CH3)(R)-CH(CH3)(R)-COOH.

   Are there any planes of symmetry in this molecule? If both chiral centers are R, then the molecule would not be symmetric. Because having both R configurations would mean the substituents are arranged in a way that lacks a plane of symmetry.

   Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can have a plane of symmetry if the substituents are arranged appropriately. But in this case, with both R, I don't think so.

   So this molecule has two chiral centers, and no plane of symmetry making it meso. Therefore, it's chiral and optically active. So this counts as one.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**
   This is a cyclohexene ring with an alcohol group at position 1, and the substituents are in the R configuration.

   Let's think about the structure. The cyclohexene ring has a double bond between C3 and C4 (since it's cyclohex-3-en-1-ol). The OH group is on C1.

   So, is there a chiral center here? The OH is on C1, which is attached to the cyclohexene ring. The ring is sp² hybridized at C3 and C4. So C1 is attached to:

   - The cyclohexene ring (which includes substituents from adjacent carbons)
   - -OH
   - Two other substituents.

   Wait, but in a cyclohexene ring, each carbon is connected to two other carbons in the ring. So C1 is connected to C2 and C6 in the ring. So substituents on C1 would be:

   - OH
   - The ring (so C2 and C6)
   - And possibly a hydrogen or another substituent.

   Wait, the structure of cyclohex-3-en-1-ol would have the ring with a double bond between C3 and C4. So C1 has an OH group, C2, C6, and perhaps a hydrogen.

   So the substituents on C1 are:

   - OH
   - C2 (which is part of the ring)
   - C6 (another part of the ring)
   - And a hydrogen.

   Wait, but wait, in a cyclohexene, each carbon in the ring is bonded to two adjacent carbons. So C1 is bonded to C2 and C6, and has two more substituents. Oh wait, no. Since it's cyclohexene, it's a six-membered ring, so each carbon is bonded to two adjacent carbons and two other substituents.

   Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Each carbon in a cyclohexene ring is bonded to two adjacent carbons and two other groups. If the ring has a double bond (like between C3 and C4), then those two carbons are sp² hybridized and each have two substituents besides the double bond.

   For C1, which is where the OH is attached, it's a single-bonded carbon in the ring. So the substituents on C1 are:

   - OH
   - C2
   - C6
   - And a hydrogen? Or maybe another substituent.

   Wait, in cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the structure is:

   O
   || 
   C1-OH
      \
       C2 – C3=C4 – C5 – C6 – C1

   So C1 is connected to C2 and C6, and has an OH and a hydrogen. So substituents on C1 are: OH, C2, C6, and H.

   So four substituents. Are any of them identical? Let's see: C2 and C6 are different parts of the ring. C2 is next to C1 and C3, while C6 is next to C1 and C5. But in terms of substituents, they're not identical. So C1 has four different substituents:

   - OH
   - C2 (which is connected to C1 and C3)
   - C6 (connected to C1 and C5)
   - H

   So yes, C1 is a chiral center. Therefore, this compound is chiral and optically active.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**
   This is a cyclohexane ring with three OH groups at positions 1, 3, and 5, all in the s configuration.

   So, each of these carbons (C1, C3, C5) has an OH group. Let's check each for chirality.

   Take C1: it's attached to C2 and C6 in the ring, has an OH group, and a hydrogen. So substituents are:

   - OH
   - C2
   - C6
   - H

   Are these all different? C2 and C6 are different parts of the ring, so substituents are OH, C2, C6, H. So four different groups. So C1 is a chiral center.

   Similarly, C3 and C5 would each be chiral centers as well. But wait, we have to think about the symmetry of the molecule. If all three OH groups are in the same configuration (s), does that make the molecule symmetric?

   The molecule is (1s,3s,5s), which means each of these carbons has the same configuration. So looking at the cyclohexane ring, if you have OH groups at 1,3,5 positions, and all are s, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry.

   Wait, let me visualize this. Imagine a cyclohexane ring with OH groups at positions 1,3,5. If all are s, perhaps the molecule is symmetric. Because if you rotate the molecule 120 degrees, each OH would be in a position that's symmetric.

   Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the center of the ring, making it meso. For example, if there's a plane that makes each OH on the same side, then the molecule would be achiral.

   Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the three stereocenters don't allow for a plane of symmetry. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think: in a cyclohexane ring with three substituents at 1,3,5 positions, if all substituents are the same (like OH) and in the same configuration, the molecule could be symmetric.

   Wait, but if all three are same configuration, like all R or all S, but in a way that the molecule is not symmetric. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the arrangement of substituents leads to the molecule being meso.

   Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a center of inversion, making it achiral. For example, if the configuration is such that each substituent is mirrored across the center, then it's a meso compound.

   Alternatively, perhaps each substituent is arranged in a way that when you look from the top, the OH groups are on the same face, leading to a symmetric structure.

   Alternatively, maybe this molecule is a meso compound because of the arrangement of substituents. If the three substituents are arranged symmetrically, the molecule could be achiral.

   Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think of another example. For example, a cyclohexane with three substituents at 1,3,5 positions could be a meso compound if the substituents are arranged symmetrically. So if the substituents are all the same and arranged in a way that flipping the molecule over leaves it unchanged, then it's a meso compound.

   For (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol, perhaps the molecule is meso. Because the substituents are arranged symmetrically, making the molecule achiral. But I'm not entirely confident.

   Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not meso. If all three OH groups are in the same configuration, but in a way that doesn't produce a plane of symmetry, then the molecule would be chiral and optically active.

   Hmm. I'm a bit stuck on this one. Let me think of another approach. If the molecule has three chiral centers, but the molecule is symmetric, then it's a meso compound. For example, if you can draw a plane that reflects the molecule onto itself, making it achiral despite having multiple stereocenters.

   Alternatively, maybe the molecule isn't symmetric. Let me imagine the molecule: cyclohexane with OH groups at 1,3,5. If all are s (say, all pointing in the same direction, either all up or all down), the molecule could be symmetric. For example, if you have a plane going through the center, the substituents on opposite sides would mirror each other.

   So, perhaps the molecule is meso. If that's the case, it's achiral and not optically active. Alternatively, if it's not symmetric, then it would be chiral.

   Wait, but I'm not certain. Another way to think: if the molecule has an even number of stereocenters, it's more likely to be meso, but here we have three. Hmm.

   Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the three stereocenters break any possible symmetry. So the molecule has no plane of symmetry and thus is chiral.

   I'm not entirely sure, but I'll tentatively say this molecule is chiral and optically active. So I'll count this as one.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**
   Structure: cyclopentyl group attached to C1 of a butanone (butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CO). So the structure would be cyclopentyl-CO-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3).

   Wait, but butan-1-one is CH3-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, butan-1-one is actually:

   O
   || 
   C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3

   So, butan-1-one would be pentan-2-one? No, I'm getting confused. Wait, butan-1-one would be:

   CH2-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3? No, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. Butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CO, but wait, butan-1-one is CH2CH2CH2COCH3? No, wait, butanone is usually (CH3)2CO (acetone, propan-2-one), or CH3CH2COCH3 (butan-2-one), or CH3CH2CH2COCH3 (pentan-2-one).

   Wait, but the question says butan-1-one. So that's a four-carbon chain with the ketone at position 1. So structure:

   O
   || 
   C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3

   So, it's pentan-1-one? Or butan-1-one would be four carbons, so:

   O
   ||
   C-CH2-CH2-CH2-

   Which would be (CH2)3-CO, but that's a four-carbon chain? Wait, butan-1-one would be:

   O
   ||
   C-CH2-CH2-CH2-

   Wait, that can't be, because butan-1-one would have four carbons in total. So:

   O
   ||
   C-CH2-CH2-CH2-

   No, that's not possible. Wait, butan-1-one is a four-carbon compound with the carbonyl group at position 1. So structure would be:

   O
   ||
   C-CH2-CH2-CH2-

   But that's a three-carbon chain after the carbonyl. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Alternatively, perhaps butan-1-one is:

   O
   ||
   C-CH2-CH2-CH3

   So that's a four-carbon chain, but the carbonyl is on the first carbon. So, the structure is (CH2)3CO, but that would be a four-carbon chain. Hmm, perhaps it's more accurately written as (CH2)3CO, but I'm not entirely sure.

   Anyway, regardless of the exact structure, the key is to look for chiral centers.

   The compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So the carbonyl is on C1, which is connected to a cyclopentyl group. C3 has a methyl group.

   Let me draw this out:

   C1: carbonyl (O)
   C2: connected to C1 and C3
   C3: connected to C2, C4, and a methyl group
   C4: connected to C3 and possibly a CH3

   Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

   Cyclopentyl group attached to C1 (the carbonyl carbon), then the chain goes C1-CO-C2-CH2-C3-CH(CH3)-C4? No, perhaps not.

   Wait, butan-1-one is:

   O
   ||
   C-CH2-CH2-CH2-

   So butan-1-one would have a four-carbon chain, with the carbonyl on C1. So:

   O
   ||
   C1 - C2 - C3 - C4

   So C1 is carbonyl, C2 is CH2, C3 is CH2, C4 is CH3.

   So butan-1-one is (CH2)3CO.

   So in 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, the substituents are:

   - C1 (carbonyl) is attached to cyclopentyl group and the rest of the chain.

   So the structure would be:

   O
   ||
   C1 (cyclopentyl) - C2 - C3 (CH(CH3)) - C4

   So, let's look for chiral centers.

   The carbonyl is on C1, so it's sp² hybridized. C3 is CH(CH3), so it's connected to:

   - C2
   - C4
   - CH3
   - And another group.

   Wait, but C3 would have four substituents? Let me see.

   C3 is connected to C2 (CH2), C4 (CH2), a methyl group (CH3), and possibly a hydrogen.

   Wait, no. Let me re-examine:

   The structure is:

   O
   ||
   C1 (cyclopentyl) - C2 (CH2) - C3 (CH(CH3)) - C4 (CH3)

   So, C3 has:

   - C2 (CH2)
   - C4 (CH3)
   - CH3 (methyl)
   - And a hydrogen.

   So, substituents on C3 are: CH2 (from C2), CH3 (from C4), CH3 (methyl), and H.

   Wait, two CH3 groups and a CH2 and H. So substituents on C3 are:

   - CH2- (from C2)
   - CH3 (from C4)
   - CH3 (methyl)
   - H

   So, four substituents, but two are CH3. So two substituents are the same (CH3 groups), so C3 is not a chiral center because it doesn't have four different groups.

   Are there any other chiral centers in the molecule?

   C2: connected to C1 (cyclopentyl and carbonyl), C3, and two CH2 groups. So substituents are: C1, C3, CH2, CH2. So no, not a chiral center.

   C4: connected to C3, and three CH3 groups? No, C4 is at the end, so it's CH3. So no chiral center there.

   Wait, but what about the cyclopentyl group? The cyclopentane ring is attached to C1. Could any of the carbons in the cyclopentyl group be a chiral center?

   The cyclopentane ring is connected to C1, which is a carbonyl group. So the cyclopentyl group is attached as a substituent. The cyclopentane ring itself is a five-membered ring, and each carbon in the ring is connected to two adjacent carbons and two substituents.

   The substitution on the cyclopentane would depend on how it's attached. But unless one of the carbons in the ring has four different substituents, it won't be a chiral center.

   In this case, the cyclopentane is attached to C1 via one of its carbons. Let's say that carbon (C1 of cyclopentane) is connected to:

   - Two adjacent ring carbons
   - The carbonyl carbon (C1 of butanone)
   - And another substituent, perhaps a hydrogen.

   So substituents on C1 of cyclopentane are:

   - Two adjacent ring carbons (from the cyclopentane ring)
   - C1 of butanone
   - H

   So four substituents. Are they all different? The two adjacent carbons are part of the ring and identical in structure, so substituents from the ring would be same on each side, making the substituents on C1 of cyclopentane not all different.

   Therefore, C1 of cyclopentane is not a chiral center.

   So, the entire molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, so it's not optically active.

   Wait, but wait. Another possibility is that the cyclopentyl group itself is substituted in a way that creates a chiral center. Let me think: if the cyclopentane ring has substituents that make one of its carbons a chiral center.

   But in this case, the substituents on the cyclopentane would be:

   - The point of attachment to the butanone (C1)
   - Two adjacent CH2 groups (from the cyclopentane ring)
   - And possibly a hydrogen or another substituent.

   So unless the cyclopentane has substituents other than hydrogens, it's unlikely to have a chiral center.

   Therefore, the compound has no chiral centers, so it's not optically active.

Now, let me recap each compound:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene → No chiral center → Not active.
2. (3aR,7aS,E)-... → Has two stereocenters, not meso → Optically active.
3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid → Meso compound → Not active.
4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid → Not meso, two stereocenters → Active.
5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol → One chiral center → Active.
6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol → Possibly a meso compound → Not active? Or maybe it is chiral. Wait, earlier I was unsure. Let me reevaluate.
   Oh wait, if all three OHs are in the same configuration (s), the molecule might not be symmetric. For example, if the OHs are all on the same face, the molecule could be chiral. Alternatively, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it could be meso. Hmm.

   Let me think: cyclohexane with three substituents at 1,3,5 positions. If all substituents are same and on the same face, the molecule could have a three-fold symmetry, but no plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

   Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged such that each is opposite another, making the molecule symmetric. But with three substituents, it's tough to have such symmetry.

   Wait, three substituents at 1,3,5 positions would create a trigonal symmetry. So perhaps the molecule is symmetric, making it a meso compound.

   But I'm not entirely sure. So perhaps this compound is meso and not active. But I'm not confident.

   Alternatively, perhaps the molecule isn't a meso compound because the arrangement of the substituents doesn't allow for a plane of symmetry. If all three OHs are on the same face, the molecule could have a plane of symmetry, making it meso.

   For example, if the substituents are all axial or all equatorial, that might create a symmetric arrangement.

   Alternatively, perhaps the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

   I'm still uncertain, but perhaps I should mark this as not active since I'm more confident about the other compounds.

   Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not symmetric, so it's active. I'm torn.

   Let me make a decision: I think that (1s,3s,5s) configuration would result in a symmetric molecule, making it a meso compound and not optically active.

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one → No chiral centers → Not active.

So, counting the active compounds:

Compound 2: active
4: active
5: active
Others: not active except possibly 6, but I'm not confident.

Wait, earlier I thought compound 6 is a meso and not active. So:

Active compounds are 2,4,5. That's three. But wait, let me recount.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me go through each again:

1. Not active.
2. Active → count 1.
3. Not active.
4. Active → count 2.
5. Active → count 3.
6. Not active.
7. Not active.

So three compounds are active.

But wait, the options don't have three as the answer. Let me check the options.

Options are:
A)5
B)3
C)2
D)4

Wait, I thought three are active.

But wait, let me re-examine compound 6.

(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol.

If the molecule has three chiral centers, and if it's symmetric, it could be a meso compound, making it not active. Alternatively, if it's not symmetric, it's active.

I'm not confident, but perhaps it's better to assume it's active. Let me think again.

If the three OHs are in the same configuration (s), but their positions are 1,3,5, which are symmetric. So the molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound.

Wait, for example, if the OHs are all in the same configuration and equally spaced, the molecule could be symmetric.

So, perhaps in this case, (1s,3s,5s) leads to a meso compound, making it not active.

So, then, the active compounds are 2,4,5.

That's three. So the answer would be option B)3.

Wait, but the options say:

A)5

B)3

C)2

D)4

So the correct answer would be B)3.

But wait, I thought that compound 6 is not active, but perhaps I was wrong. Let me reconsider.

Another approach: for a molecule to be meso, it must have at least two stereocenters and an internal plane of symmetry. But if it has three stereocenters, it's possible to be meso, but less common.

In the case of (1s,3s,5s), perhaps the molecule is chiral because the arrangement of the substituents doesn't allow for a plane of symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not symmetric, making it chiral.

Wait, but how can a molecule with an odd number of substituents be symmetric? For example, three substituents at 1,3,5 positions in a cyclohexane would have a trigonal arrangement, which is symmetric.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not symmetric, and thus is chiral.

In that case, compound 6 would be optically active, adding one more to the count.

So if I'm wrong earlier, and compound 6 is active, then the active compounds are 2,4,5,6 → four in total.

But earlier, I thought compound 6 is not active.

Alternatively, perhaps I should reevaluate.

Wait, the molecule is (1s,3s,5s). Let's imagine that each of these positions has an OH group, all in the s (say, left-handed) configuration.

If the molecule is symmetric upon a 120-degree rotation, it might be achiral. But wait, a 120-degree rotation would not be a symmetry operation.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a center of inversion, making it symmetric.

Wait, another approach: imagine looking at the cyclohexane ring with substituents at 1,3,5. If each substituent is in the same configuration, and the substituents are arranged such that each has a mirror image across the center, then the molecule would be meso.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are all on the same face, making the molecule symmetric. For example, all axial or all equatorial.

If all three substituents are on the same face, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. So the molecule would be meso and not active.

Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a way that no plane of symmetry exists, the molecule would be chiral.

I'm still not certain, but perhaps the (1s,3s,5s) configuration is a meso form, making it not active.

So, sticking with three active compounds: 2,4,5.

But wait, let me think again. Wait, compound 6: if all three OH groups are on the same face, would that give the molecule a plane of symmetry?

In a cyclohexane ring, if substituents are at 1,3,5 positions and all are axial, that would create a symmetric structure. So perhaps the molecule is symmetric and thus a meso compound.

If that's the case, then compound 6 is not active.

So the total active compounds are:

2: active

4: active

5: active

Total of three.

Looking at the answer options, option B is 3.

Alternatively, but what about the (3aR,7aS,E) compound? Let me think again.

Compound 2: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione.

This is a complex bicyclic structure. If it has two stereocenters and isn't a meso compound, it would be active.

Assuming it's not a meso, which is likely due to the complex structure, it's active.

So, I think the correct count is three active compounds: 2,4,5.

Therefore, the answer is B)3.


To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality. A compound is optically active if it has at least one chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) and is not a meso compound (a compound with multiple stereocenters that is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry).

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**  
   This compound is an alkene with no chiral centers. The carbon atoms in the double bond are sp² hybridized and cannot have four different substituents.  
   **Not optically active.**

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**  
   This is a complex bicyclic compound with two stereocenters (3aR and 7aS). The molecule is not symmetric and does not form a meso compound.  
   **Optically active.**

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   This compound has two chiral centers (C2 and C3). However, due to the arrangement of the substituents, the molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound.  
   **Not optically active.**

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   This compound also has two chiral centers (C2 and C3). Unlike the (2R,3S) isomer, this compound does not have an internal plane of symmetry and is not a meso compound.  
   **Optically active.**

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**  
   This compound has a chiral center at C1, where the substituents are -OH, -C2 (part of the cyclohexene ring), -C6 (part of the cyclohexene ring), and a hydrogen. All four substituents are different.  
   **Optically active.**

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**  
   This compound has three chiral centers (C1, C3, and C5) with hydroxyl groups in the (s) configuration. The molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound.  
   **Not optically active.**

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**  
   This compound does not have any chiral centers. The carbonyl carbon (C1) is sp² hybridized, and the other carbons do not have four different substituents.
