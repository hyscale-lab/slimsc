Okay, so I've got this question about a Lagrangian and determining the mass dimension of a coupling constant and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my QFT, but let me think through this.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, and σ_{μν} is given as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I remember that in quantum field theory, the mass dimension of each term in the Lagrangian has to be 4 because the Lagrangian density has mass dimension 4 (since it's integrated over four-dimensional spacetime, so each term must have dimension 4).

Wait, wait. No, wait. The Lagrangian density has dimensions of [mass]^4 in natural units where ħ = c = 1. Because when you integrate L over d^4x, which has [mass]^-4, you get a dimensionless action. So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

So each field and coupling constant in the term must add up to 4. Let's break down the term.

The term is κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Let me think about each part.

First, ψ is a spinor field. I think the Dirac spinor ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because in the Dirac Lagrangian, L = i ψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ - m ψ̄ ψ. The derivative term must have dimension 4. So ψ̄ has dimension 3/2 because ∂_μ has dimension 1. So 3/2 (ψ̄) + 1 (∂_μ) + 3/2 (ψ) = 4. So ψ has dimension 3/2.

Then, σ_{μν} is a product of two gamma matrices and an i, but the exact expression might not matter for the dimension. Since σ_{μν} is a product of two gamma matrices, each γ has dimension 0 (because they're matrices, not fields, so they don't contribute to mass dimension). So σ_{μν} is dimensionless. So ψ̄ σ ψ is like ψ̄ ψ, each ψ is 3/2, so together that's 3.

Then F^{μν} is the field strength tensor. The field strength F is for a gauge field, like electromagnetism. The Maxwell tensor F_{μν} has derivatives of the gauge field A. So F_{μν} has the same dimension as ∂μ Aν. Since Aμ has dimension 1 (because in the Maxwell Lagrangian, it's like F^2, and ∂A has dimension 2, so A itself is 1). So F has dimension 2.

So putting it all together: the term is κ multiplied by ψ̄ σ ψ F.

The dimensions are: [κ] + [ψ̄ σ ψ] + [F] = [κ] + (3) + (2) = [κ] +5. But the term must have dimension 4. So [κ] +5 =4 → [κ] = -1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1. So the first part of the question is answered as [κ]_M = -1.

Now the second part: is the theory renormalizable?

Renormalizability depends on the mass dimension of the coupling constant. In general, a theory is renormalizable if the coupling constant has a positive mass dimension. Because in perturbation theory, each vertex contributes a factor of the coupling, and for the theory to not have higher-order divergences, the coupling's dimension must be such that the interaction terms don't lead to nonrenormalizable divergences.

Wait, no, wait. Let me recall. The renormalizability condition is usually determined by the superficial degree of divergence. But another approach is that the theory is renormalizable if the coupling has positive mass dimension because, in terms of the dimensionless coupling (which appears in the beta functions), positive dimension implies that the coupling becomes weaker at higher energies (as energy is inverse to length, and positive mass dimension means that higher scales dilute the coupling, making the theory safe from Landau poles).

Wait, but wait. The mass dimension of the coupling in the Lagrangian: for a renormalizable theory, the coupling must have a mass dimension ≥ 0. Because higher-dimensional operators (negative mass dimension) would not be renormalizable, as they bring in higher-order terms that can't be handled with a finite number of counterterms.

Wait, no, let me think again. The mass dimension of the coupling in the Lagrangian is [κ] = d. If [κ] is negative, then the term is nonrenormalizable because it's an effective interaction that becomes important at low energies.

Wait, another way to look: the coupling's mass dimension determines the engineering dimension. In the term κ ψ̄ σ ψ F, the dimension is [κ] + [ψ]^2 + [F] = [κ] +3 +2= [κ] +5=4, so [κ]=-1.

In four dimensions, the standard model couplings (like in Yang-Mills, Fermi coupling, etc.) have positive dimensions. For example, the coupling e in electromagnetism comes from a term like e A ψ̄ ψ, which has [e] = 0 (since A has dimension 1, and ψ each have 3/2, so 1 +3=4, so e must have dimension 0). Wait, no: in that case, the term is e ψ̄ γμ ψ A^μ. So [e] + [ψ]^2 + [A] = 0 +3 +1 =4, yes. So e is dimensionless.

Wait, but in this problem, the coupling κ has dimension -1. Which is negative, so it's nonrenormalizable. Because a negative mass dimension implies that the term is higher-dimensional, so it's a nonrenormalizable interaction.

Wait, but wait: the general rule is that for a theory with interaction term L ∼ g φ^n, the coupling g has dimension [g] = d - (n-1)(d/2), where d is the spacetime dimension. Wait, no, that's for scalar theories. Let me think again.

In four dimensions (d=4), a term like g φ^k has each φ with dimension (4 - 2)/2 = 1. So [φ] =1. Then, the term g φ^k must have dimension 4. So [g] + k *1 =4 → [g] =4 -k.

Wait, but in the case of a Dirac field, the dimension is 3/2 for ψ. So in the current problem, the term is κ ψ̄ σ ψ F. So each ψ is 3/2, and F is 2. So the product ψ^2 F is [3/2 *2] = 3 +2=5. So [κ] must be -1.

In terms of renormalizability, since [κ] is negative, the theory is not renormalizable. Because, in general, for an interaction term with coupling dimension [g], the theory is renormalizable only if [g] ≥0. Because if [g] is negative, each vertex contributes a factor of g with dimensions of [mass]^negative, which when you include loops, the integrals would lead to higher and higher divergences, making the theory not renormalizable.

So, the options are:

Options:

A) [κ]=-1, renormalizable. No, because [κ] is -1, which makes it non-renormalizable.

B) [κ]=1, renormalizable. No, because we found [κ]=-1.

C) [κ]=-1, not renormalizable. Yes, that matches.

D) [κ]=1, not renormalizable. No.

So the correct answer is C.

To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$. The Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4 in natural units ($\hbar = c = 1$), as it is integrated over four-dimensional spacetime.

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of the fields
- The Dirac spinor field $\psi$ has mass dimension $[\psi] = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ for a gauge field has mass dimension $[F^{\mu\nu}] = 2$.
- The $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ term is a product of two gamma matrices, which are dimensionless, so $[\sigma_{\mu\nu}] = 0$.

### Step 2: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
The term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ must have mass dimension 4. Breaking it down:
- $[\bar{\psi}] = [\psi] = \frac{3}{2}$.
- $[\sigma_{\mu\nu}] = 0$.
- $[F^{\mu\nu}] = 2$.

Thus, the total dimension of the term is:
\[
[\kappa] + [\bar{\psi}] + [\psi] + [F^{\mu\nu}] = [\kappa] + \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = [\kappa] + 5.
\]
To satisfy $[\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}] = 4$, we solve:
\[
[\kappa] + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa] = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability
A theory is renormalizable if the coupling constant has a non-negative mass dimension ($[\kappa] \geq 0$). Here, $[\kappa] = -1$, which is negative. This indicates that the interaction term is nonrenormalizable, as higher-order divergences cannot be absorbed by a finite number of counterterms.

### Conclusion
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $[\kappa]_M = -1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.
