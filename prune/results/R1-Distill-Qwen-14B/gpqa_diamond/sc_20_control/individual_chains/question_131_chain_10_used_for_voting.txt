Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So the problem starts with a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. That dicarboxylic acid is dehydrated to form an anhydride. The anhydride has some specific NMR characteristics, and then it reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. The products are a major and a minor product, both with the formula C13H16O3. Then, their NOESY NMR spectra are taken, and the major product has a cross-peak, while the minor doesn't. The question is about which resonances are connected by that cross-peak in the major product.

Hmm. Let me break this down.

First, the initial reaction: the dicarboxylic acid with cis-alkene dehydrates to form an anhydride. I remember that when a diacid dehydrates, it typically forms an anhydride. Since the starting material has a cis-alkene, the anhydride would probably have a structure where the two carbonyl groups are connected in a way that reflects that.

Looking at the anhydride's NMR data: the 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. Wait, 7 ppm is a region where aromatic protons usually appear. But wait, the anhydride doesn't have any aromatic rings, right? Or does it? Hmm, maybe it's a conjugated diene or something else. Wait, wait, another thought—if the starting material was a diacid with a cis-alkene, the dehydration would lead to an anhydride with a double bond still present. Oh, but wait, dehydration of a diacid would form an anhydride, but if the original had an alkene, perhaps the anhydride structure is such that there's a conjugated double bond.

Wait, but the 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm. What could cause a singlet in that region? Maybe an aromatic proton, but if it's a singlet, that suggests all equivalent protons. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinyl group with a symmetrical structure. Wait, maybe it's a cyclic structure where the protons are all equivalent.

Alternatively, maybe the anhydride is something like cyclic, like a maleic anhydride, but that's a trans structure. Wait, the starting acid has a cis-alkene. So when it dehydrates, the anhydride would have a cis arrangement. So maybe the structure is similar to cis-butenedioic anhydride. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the 13C NMR of the anhydride shows two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Carbon shifts can help. 165 ppm is probably an oxygenated carbon, like a carbonyl. 137 is in the range for a sp2 carbon, maybe a double bond. So perhaps the anhydride has a structure where there's a conjugated double bond, leading to the two carbons: the carbonyls and the double bond carbons.

Wait, let me think: in an anhydride, the structure is like O=C-O-C-O=C, but with the possibility of a double bond elsewhere. If the starting material had a cis-alkene, maybe the anhydride is formed such that the double bond is now part of the ring.

Wait, perhaps the anhydride is a cyclic structure. For instance, if the starting dicarboxylic acid is cis-butenedioic acid, the anhydride would be a cyclic anhydride, maybe like cis-cyclobutanedicarboxylic anhydride. But in that case, the protons adjacent to the double bond would be in a certain environment.

Wait, but the 1H NMR of the anhydride shows a single peak at 7 ppm. If it's a cyclic anhydride with a double bond, perhaps the two protons on the double bond are equivalent, leading to a singlet. For example, in a five-membered ring with a double bond, maybe like cyclopentene-based anhydride.

Wait, but let me think about the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the anhydride is a diepoxy structure, but probably not. Alternatively, maybe the anhydride has a bridge structure or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the anhydride isn't cyclic. If it's a simple anhydride, like a substituted maleic anhydride, the protons on the double bond would be as a pair of doublets. But wait, the 1H NMR only shows a single peak. Oh, but wait, if the two protons are equivalent, like in a symmetric structure, then they would give a single peak. For example, in a structure where the double bond is between two identical groups.

Wait, maybe the anhydride is something like a substituted bicyclic structure. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted maleic anhydride where the substituents are such that the two vinyl protons are equivalent, giving a singlet.

Wait, but for a trans double bond, the protons would be trans, but if the substituents are symmetric, maybe the protons are equivalent, so their signals would merge into a singlet. For example, if the anhydride is a symmetric, like the two R groups on each side of the double bond are the same, then the two protons would be equivalent.

So, if the dicarboxylic acid was, say, HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a cis double bond in between. Wait, no, that's a single bond. Wait, perhaps the dicarboxylic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that's not a double bond. Oh wait, the original has a cis alkene, so maybe it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond in the middle, making it HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH → but that's not possible. Wait, no, if it's a diacid, perhaps it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that's single bonds. Wait, maybe it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a cis double bond between the two CH2 groups. So, the structure would be HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but the middle is a double bond, making it HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH → wait, that's not possible. Wait, wait, maybe it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond between the two CH2 groups, but that would make HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH → no, that can't be. Wait, perhaps the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH where the middle CH2 is a double bond, so it's actually HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups, making it HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH → no, that's not right. Wait, perhaps the dicarboxylic acid is something like HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH, but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups, making it HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH → no, that's the same as before.

Wait, maybe the structure is more like HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH but with a double bond in the middle. So, HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH becomes HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH, but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. Wait, that's impossible because the CH2 groups are single bonds. Oh wait, perhaps the structure is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH, but the middle is a CH₂ group with a double bond. No, that doesn't add up.

Wait, perhaps the original structure is a diacid where the two carboxylic acid groups are on adjacent carbons, making the diacid HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH, but with a double bond between the middle carbons. So, it would be HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH → but that's only single bonds. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a di-carboxylic acid with a cis double bond, such as HO₂C-CH₂-CH₂-CO₂H, but with a cis double bond between the CH₂ groups. No, that would require the structure to be HO₂C-CH₂-CH₂-CO₂H, but that's a single bond. Oh, wait, perhaps the structure is HO₂C-CH₂-CH₂-CO₂H but the middle has a double bond, making it HO₂C-CH₂-CH₂-CO₂H → but that's not possible. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH and the dehydration forms an anhydride with a double bond. So, when dehydrated, the two carboxylic acid groups would lose water and form an anhydride. The dehydration would typically form a double bond between the two carbons that were adjacent to the COOH groups. So, if the original structure was HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, dehydration would form an anhydride with a double bond in the middle. So, for example, the structure would be O=C-(CH2)2-O-C=O, but in an anhydride form, it would be a cyclic structure. Wait, but in that case, the two CH2 groups would be part of a four-membered ring with two double bonds? Or maybe a five-membered ring?

Alternatively, perhaps the anhydride formed is a cyclic structure with a double bond. For instance, if the starting material is cis-butenedioic acid (HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH with a double bond between the middle carbons), then dehydrating it would form a cyclic anhydride where the double bond remains. So, the anhydride would have a structure where the two carbonyl groups are connected by a three-carbon chain with a double bond. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the anhydride is a substituted maleic anhydride. Maleic anhydride has a structure where the two carbonyl groups are connected by a double bond (cis), and the oxygen bridges are in between. So, the structure is a five-membered ring with two double bonds. Wait, no, maleic anhydride is a cyclic structure with a double bond between the two carbonyl carbons. So, its structure is a five-membered ring with two double bonds: O=C-(C-O-C)-C=O, but in a ring. So, the structure is a cyclic anhydride with a double bond between the two carbonyls. So, in this case, the anhydride would have a double bond in the ring.

But then, in the 1H NMR, the region at 7 ppm suggests protons on the double bond. So, the two vinyl protons in the anhydride would be at around 7 ppm. However, if the structure is symmetric, maybe the two protons are equivalent and give a singlet. For example, in maleic anhydride, the two protons on the double bond are trans and would appear as a pair of doublets. But in the problem, it's a single peak, so maybe the structure is such that the two protons are equivalent.

Wait, but the starting material was a cis-alkene. So the diacid would have a cis double bond, and when it dehydrates to form the anhydride, the double bond would remain cis. So, if the anhydride is cyclic, the two protons on the double bond would be cis. But in a cyclic structure, would they be equivalent? For example, in a five-membered ring, if the substituents are symmetric, maybe the two protons are equivalent and thus give a single peak.

Alternatively, perhaps the anhydride isn't cyclic. Maybe it's a straight-chain anhydride with a double bond. For example, if the anhydride is something like HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH, but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. Wait, but that would require the structure to be O=C-O-CH₂-CH₂-O-C=O, but that's a straight-chain anhydride. But in that structure, the protons on the CH2 groups adjacent to the oxygen would be in a different environment.

Wait, perhaps the structure is O=C-O-CH₂-CH₂-O-C=O, but that's a straight anhydride, not cyclic. If that's the case, the protons on the CH2 groups would be split based on their environment. But the 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, which doesn't fit with CH2 protons, as they're usually around 1-3 ppm. Unless it's vinyl protons, which are around 5-7 ppm.

Wait, maybe the anhydride has a structure where the double bond is between the two carbonyl groups, making it a conjugated system. So, in that case, the protons on the double bond would be at higher ppm, around 7 ppm.

So, if the anhydride has a double bond between the two carbonyl groups, and the two protons on the double bond are equivalent, their NMR would be a singlet at 7 ppm. That makes sense.

In the 13C NMR, the anhydride has two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. So, 137 ppm is likely a sp2 carbon (like the carbons in the double bond), and 165 ppm is the carbonyl carbons. Wait, but in an anhydride, each carbonyl carbon is typically around 170-185 ppm. So 165 seems a bit low, but maybe it's an enol ether or something else. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the 165 ppm is for the carbonyl, and the 137 is the sp2 carbon.

Wait, so the anhydride has a structure where the two carbonyl groups are connected by a double bond, leading to a conjugated dien structure. Wait, no, an anhydride is O=C-O-C-O=C=O, but if it's a cyclic structure, the double bond would be within the ring. Hmm.

Well, maybe the exact structure isn't crucial right now. Let's move on to the reaction part. The anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. So, the diene is 1,3-cyclopentadiene, all four substituents on the double bonds are methyl groups. So, the structure is a five-membered ring with two double bonds at positions 1,3, and each of the four carbons involved in the double bonds has a methyl group. So, each of the four carbons (positions 1,2,3,4) has a methyl substituent.

Wait, the structure of 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene would be a cyclopentadiene ring where carbons 1 and 3 are double bonds, and each of carbons 1,2,3,4 has a methyl group attached. So, it's a highly substituted diene.

Now, the anhydride reacting with this diene—what kind of reaction is that? Diene plus anhydride—probably a Diels-Alder reaction. Because the anhydride would act as a dienophile, and the 1,3-diene would act as the diene. So, Diels-Alder: [4+2] cycloaddition between the diene and the dienophile (the anhydride) to form a six-membered ring with an oxygen bridge (the anhydride part becomes a bridge in the cycloadduct).

So, the Diels-Alder reaction would form a bicyclic structure. The major and minor products would result from different stereochemical outcomes of the reaction. Since the diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl, which is a highly substituted diene, the endo rule would predict that the endo transition state is favored, leading to the major product.

Wait, but let's think about the structure of the dienophile. The anhydride is a good dienophile, especially if it's electron-deficient. The reaction would proceed via the Diels-Alder mechanism, forming a six-membered ring with the oxygen bridge from the anhydride.

Now, the major and minor products have the same molecular formula, C13H16O3. So, the products are based on the stereochemistry of the Diels-Alder adduct. Since the diene is symmetric (all methyl groups in 1,2,3,4 positions), perhaps the endo transition state leads to a particular stereochemistry, and the exo gives another.

But wait, the question is about the NOESY NMR spectra. The major product has a cross-peak, which implies that two protons are close in space and thus cause a NOE effect. The minor product doesn't have this cross-peak, indicating that those protons are not close in space.

So, the cross-peak connects two resonances. We need to figure out which two groups these are.

Looking at the options:

A) 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm.

B) 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.

C) 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm.

D) 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.

Wait, the cross-peak is between two sets of protons. So, when the cross-peak is present, the two protons are close in space—this suggests that in the major product, the two groups are on adjacent carbons or in a certain spatial arrangement.

In the Diels-Alder adduct, the endo rule would position the substituents in such a way that bulky groups are on the same side as the bridge (the oxygen from the anhydride). The substituents on the diene (the methyl groups) would be either axial or equatorial, depending on the transition state.

But let me think about the structure. The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. When it reacts with the anhydride, the Diels-Alder would form a bicyclo structure. The product would be a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene derivative, perhaps.

Wait, the Diels-Alder of cyclopentadiene with an anhydride would form a bicyclo structure. Let me imagine the structure: the diene is 1,3-cyclopentadiene, and the dienophile is the anhydride.

The adduct would have the two new sigma bonds: the diene's ends (positions 1 and 4) would bond to the dienophile's ends (the carbonyl groups). So, the product would have a six-membered ring with substituents.

Wait, maybe the structure is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane derivative. The oxygen from the anhydride would form part of the bridge.

In the product, the substituents from the diene (the methyl groups) would be attached to the bridgehead carbons and the adjacent carbons.

In the Diels-Alder adduct, the endo transition state brings the substituents on the dienophile (the anhydride groups) into close proximity with the substituents on the diene. So, the major product would have the substituents (like the bridgehead) positioned in a way that the bulky groups are on the same face, leading to the endo transition state.

But how does this relate to the NMR and the NOESY cross-peak?

The NOESY cross-peak indicates that two protons are close in space. So, perhaps in the major product, two protons from different groups are close, but in the minor product, they are not.

Looking at the options, the cross-peak connects two sets of protons. For example, in option B, a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.

Wait, what kind of protons would be 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm? That sounds like a set of equivalent methyl groups, perhaps attached to a bridgehead. 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm might be two equivalent protons, perhaps in an axial position in a ring.

Alternatively, the 6H singlet at ~1 ppm could be methyl groups attached to a cyclopentane ring, perhaps.

Wait, but let's think about the structure of the product. The Diels-Alder product would have two new substituents from the dienophile (the oxygen bridge) and the substituents from the diene (the methyl groups).

In the product, the six-membered ring would have the two substituents (from the dienophile) at positions 1 and 4, connected by the bridge. The diene's substituents (methyl groups) would be in positions 2,3,5,6, perhaps.

Wait, perhaps the adduct has two methyl groups adjacent to the bridge. Alternatively, maybe the bridge is between carbons 1 and 4 of the cyclopentadiene, making the substituents at positions 2 and 5 (or something like that).

Alternatively, perhaps in the major product, the two methyl groups are on adjacent carbons and are close in space, causing a NOE effect between their protons.

But the cross-peak connects two different sets of protons. So, perhaps one set is the six methyl protons and the other is the two bridge protons.

Wait, perhaps in the major product, the bridgehead protons are close to the adjacent methyl groups. So, for example, two bridgehead protons (maybe a singlet at 3.5 ppm) and the adjacent methyl groups (6H singlet at 1.7 ppm) would be close, leading to a NOE effect.

Alternatively, maybe the bridgehead protons are axial and the methyl groups are equatorial, or vice versa.

Alternatively, perhaps the cross-peak is between the protons on the bridge (the two protons) and a set of methyl groups adjacent to them.

Wait, let's think about the possible structures.

The dienophile is the anhydride, which after reaction would form a bridge in the product. So, in the Diels-Alder adduct, the two carbonyl groups from the anhydride are now part of the bridge. So, the bridge would be an oxygen bridge, perhaps making a bicyclo structure like bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride, but that's just an example.

Wait, but the product's molecular formula is C13H16O3. Let's count the atoms.

The anhydride's formula: let's say the starting anhydride is C4H2O3 (if it's, say, maleic anhydride, which is C4H2O3). The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, which would have a formula of C9H12 (since cyclopentadiene is C5H6, and adding four methyl groups adds 4*(CH3) → C5+4*C= C9; H: 6 +4*3= 18 H? Wait, wait: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclopentadiene would have the structure where each of positions 1,2,3,4 has a methyl group. So, the cyclopentadiene ring is five carbons, with four methyl groups. Each methyl adds 3 H, so: the cyclopentadiene itself has 6 H (since it's a conjugated diene, I think it's 6 H originally?), but adding four methyl groups adds 4*3=12 H. So the formula would be C9H16? Wait, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. The base cyclopentadiene is C5H6 (since it's a five-membered ring with two double bonds, so each double bond removes two H, but wait, cyclopentadiene is a diene, so it has four double bonds? No, wait, 1,3-cyclopentadiene has two double bonds, making it a conjugated diene. So, the structure is a five-membered ring with two double bonds, and four substituents (methyl groups) on positions 1,2,3,4.

The formula for cyclopentadiene (without substituents) is C5H6. Adding four methyl groups (each CH3) adds 4*(CH3) → 4 carbons and 12 hydrogens. So total formula is C9H18? Wait, because each methyl adds 3 H. But wait, the diene is 1,3-cyclopentadiene, which is C5H6. Adding four methyl groups (each -CH3) would make it C5+4= C9. The H count would be 6 (from the diene) + 4*3=12 → 18 H. So the diene is C9H18.

The anhydride: let's say it's a four-carbon molecule, like maleic anhydride, which is C4H2O3. So when they react, the Diels-Alder forms a bicyclic structure by combining four carbons from the diene and two from the dienophile. Wait, no, the diene is conjugated, four pi electrons, and the dienophile has two. So, the product would have six-membered ring, but considering the substituents.

Wait, the Diels-Alder reaction forms a six-membered ring. The diene contributes four carbons, and the dienophile contributes two. So, the product would have four (from diene) + two (from dienophile) = six carbons. But the dienophile is C4H2O3, which has four carbons. Hmm, perhaps I need to rethink.

Wait, the dienophile is the anhydride, which is a four-carbon molecule (like maleic anhydride: O=C-(C-O-C)-C=O). So, when it reacts, two of its carbons become part of the six-membered ring. So, the product would have the four carbons from the diene plus the two from the dienophile's carbonyl groups, making six carbons. Additionally, the diene had four methyl groups, so the product would have those four methyl groups plus any from the dienophile.

Wait, perhaps the anhydride doesn't have any methyl groups. So, the product's formula would be: diene (C9H18) + dienophile (C4H2O3) → but then, the Diels-Alder reaction forms a six-membered ring, combining four from diene and two from dienophile, and eliminating two H2O? No, wait, Diels-Alder doesn't eliminate water; it's a [4+2] cycloaddition without elimination. So, the product would have the sum of the atoms from both reactants.

Wait, the diene is C9H18, the anhydride is C4H2O3. So, the product would have C9 + C4 = C13, H18 + H2 = H20, O3. But the product's formula is C13H16O3. So, the reaction must have lost four hydrogens. That makes sense because the Diels-Alder forms two new sigma bonds, which typically removes two pairs of H (each bond formation uses two Hs). So, two sigma bonds → four Hs lost. So, the product is C13H16O3.

So, the product has a formula matching the question.

Now, the two products (major and minor) result from different stereochemical outcomes of the Diels-Alder reaction. Since the dienophile is symmetric (the anhydride), and the diene is also symmetric, perhaps there are two possible diastereomers formed, leading to major and minor products based on their transition states (endo vs exo).

In the major product (endo), the substituents from the dienophile and the diene are on the same face, leading to a certain spatial arrangement of protons.

In the minor product (exo), they are on opposite faces.

Now, the NOESY cross-peak is present in the major product but not in the minor. So, the cross-peak indicates that in the major product, two protons are close in space. These protons must be on adjacent atoms or in close proximity due to the spatial arrangement.

Looking at the options, let's consider each possibility.

Option A: 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm.

A 6H singlet suggests a set of equivalent protons, likely from multiple methyl groups. The 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm suggests a single proton with one neighboring proton.

But in the product, where would a single proton be? Maybe a bridgehead proton. But wait, in a bicyclic structure, the bridgehead protons are typically two in number (if it's a bicyclo[2.2.1] structure), so a doublet would involve coupling with another proton. But if the bridgehead has two protons, perhaps as a doublet of doublets, but I'm not sure.

Option B: 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.

The 6H singlet could be three equivalent methyl groups (each contributing 2H?), but wait, 6H would be two methyl groups (each 3H). Wait, no, each CH3 is 3H. So, 6H would be two CH3 groups, but as a singlet, perhaps they're in equivalent positions. The 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm could be two equivalent protons, perhaps in an axial position in a ring.

Option C: 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm.

That would be two sets of equivalent methyl groups, perhaps in different environments. But this seems less likely to have a cross-peak between them, unless they're spatially close, which I'm not sure about.

Option D: 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.

So, a single proton (doublet) and two equivalent protons (singlet). This could be a bridgehead proton and two axial protons on the ring.

But wait, in a Diels-Alder adduct, the bridgehead would have two protons, not one. So, a 1H doublet seems unlikely unless it's a geminal di-substitution, but that's not typical.

Wait, perhaps the bridgehead has two protons, each as a doublet, due to coupling with each other. But in that case, they would be a doublet of doublets, but maybe in the spectrum, they appear as a doublet because the coupling constants are similar.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1H doublet is a methyl group attached to a bridgehead, but I'm not sure.

Let me think about the structure again. The product is a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene derivative. The bridgehead carbons (positions 1 and 4) each have two substituents: one from the diene and one from the dienophile. The substituents from the diene are methyl groups at positions 2,3,5,6.

Wait, perhaps in the major product, the two bridgehead protons are axial and the adjacent methyl groups are equatorial. This arrangement would bring the protons on the bridgehead (axial) close to the equatorial methyl groups. So, in the NOESY, the axial protons would show a cross-peak with the equatorial methyl protons.

In that case, the 2H singlet (axial protons) would have a cross-peak with the 6H singlet (equatorial methyl groups). Looking at the options, option B has a 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm and 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm. So, the cross-peak would be between these two.

Alternatively, if the methyl groups are axial and the bridgehead protons are equatorial, but that would depend on the structure.

Wait, the NOE effect occurs when two protons are close in space (typically within 3-4 Å), which can happen when they are on adjacent carbons (vicinal) or in a particular conformation.

In the major product, if the bridgehead protons are axial, they would be pointing upwards and downwards, but in a bicyclo structure, they might be in a position where they're close to substituents on the same face.

Alternatively, perhaps the bridgehead protons are close to the methyl groups attached to the adjacent carbons.

In any case, looking back at the options, option B is a cross-peak between a 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm (probably methyl groups) and a 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm (possibly bridgehead protons).

So, in the major product, the two bridgehead protons (2H singlet) are close to the six equivalent methyl protons, leading to a cross-peak in the NOESY spectrum. In the minor product, perhaps the bridgehead protons are on the opposite side, making them not close to the methyl groups, so no cross-peak.

Therefore, the correct answer would be option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves the reaction of a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene, which dehydrates to form an anhydride. The anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene via a Diels-Alder reaction to yield two products: a major product (endo transition state) and a minor product (exo transition state). Both products have the molecular formula C13H16O3. The major product exhibits a cross-peak in its NOESY NMR spectrum, while the minor product does not. The task is to determine which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak in the major product.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Structure of the Anhydride**:  
   The anhydride is formed by dehydration of a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. Its 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, indicating equivalent vinyl protons, and its 13C NMR shows peaks at 137 ppm (sp2 carbon) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon). This suggests a symmetric anhydride structure, likely a cyclic anhydride with a double bond.

2. **Diels-Alder Reaction**:  
   The anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene as the dienophile and diene, respectively. The reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene derivative. The major product (endo) has substituents on the same face of the bicyclic structure, while the minor product (exo) has substituents on opposite faces.

3. **NOESY Cross-Peak in the Major Product**:  
   The NOESY cross-peak indicates spatial proximity between two sets of protons. In the major product, the two bridgehead protons (likely axial) are close to the six equivalent methyl groups (equatorial). This spatial arrangement occurs due to the endo transition state, where bulky groups are positioned on the same face.

4. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm. This is unlikely, as the product does not have a single proton in the expected environment.  
   - **Option B**: A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. This matches the expected environment: the 6H singlet corresponds to equivalent methyl groups, and the 2H singlet corresponds to bridgehead protons. These two sets of protons are spatially close in the major product.  
   - **Option C**: Two 6H singlets at ~1 ppm and ~1.7 ppm. This does not explain the cross-peak, as these protons are not spatially close.  
   - **Option D**: A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. This is unlikely, as the product does not have a single proton in the expected environment.

### Conclusion:
The cross-peak in the NOESY spectrum of the major product connects the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (equatorial methyl groups) and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (axial bridgehead protons). This is consistent with the spatial arrangement in the endo product.
