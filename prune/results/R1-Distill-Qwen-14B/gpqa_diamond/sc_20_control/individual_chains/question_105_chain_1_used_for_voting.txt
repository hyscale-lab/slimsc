Alright, I'm trying to tackle this astronomy problem. Let's see what it's about. So, the question is about a star with some dark spots and how that affects the observed brightness variations. The setup is comparing this scenario to the effect of an exoplanet on the light curve. I need to find the radius of the exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star.

Okay, let's break it down. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's, Rstar = R_sun. The spots cover one hemisphere with a filling factor of 20%. That means 20% of that hemisphere's area is covered by spots. Wait, no, filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered by spots. So if the star is a sphere, the total surface area is 4πR^2. But the spots are on one hemisphere, so the area of one hemisphere is 2πR^2. The filling factor is 0.2, so the total spotted area is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

Each spot is cooler than the star. The star's Teff is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler, so their temperature is 5000K. The brightness variation when the spots rotate into and out of view is what's causing the periodic dimming. The problem states that this effect is similar to an exoplanet transiting in front of the star.

Wait, no, the exoplanet would cause a dip in brightness when it transits, as it blocks some light. The spotted star's brightness change is due to the spots being cooler, so when they face us, the star appears a bit dimmer. But the effect is like a planet transiting but maybe the opposite? Because when spots are on the leading side, the brightness is lower, and when they rotate away, it increases. So the maximum dip would be when the spot area is facing us.

So, the amplitude of the brightness variation is due to the difference in brightness from spots versus the rest of the star. The exoplanet's effect is a dip when it blocks light. The star's spots cause a dip as well, but it's a continuous modulating effect because the spots are moving as the star rotates.

The question says that if the star wasn't covered by spots, what radius planet would produce the same amplitude in the light curve. So I need to find Rpl such that the maximum dip caused by the planet is equal to the maximum dip caused by the spots.

Let me think about each effect. The planet's contribution to the dip is (Rpl / Rstar)^2 when it's directly in front, because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius.

For the spots, the dip is the area of the spots (as a fraction of the star's surface) multiplied by the difference in brightness per unit area. The brightness per unit area is L proportional to T^4 (from Stefan-Boltzmann). So each spot has B_spot = sigma*T_spot^4, and the star has B_star = sigma*T_star^4.

The difference per unit area is (B_spot - B_star) = sigma*(T_spot^4 - T_star^4). But since the spots are cooler, this will be negative, but when they're facing us, the star's total brightness is reduced by the area of the spots times the difference. So the maximum dip in brightness is:

Dip_spots = (Area_spots / Area_star) * (B_spot - B_star) / B_star

Wait, I think I need to compute the fractional change in brightness when the spots are fully visible. Because the star's brightness is the sum of the unspotted areas and the spotted areas.

The star's total brightness when the spots are facing us is:

B_total = (1 - f) * B_star * Area_unspotted + f * B_spot * Area_spotted

But wait, the filling factor is f, which is the fraction of the hemisphere covered. Since the star is a sphere, when the spots are on one hemisphere, the area of the spots is f * 2πR² (since a hemisphere is 2πR²). The total area of the star is 4πR². So when the spots are on the hemisphere, the fraction of the star's surface that is spotted is (f * 2πR²) / (4πR²) ) = f/2.

So the unspotted fraction is 1 - (f/2) = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9.

So the brightness when spots are visible would be:

B_spots_visible = (1 - f/2) * B_star + (f/2) * B_spot

The normal brightness is B_normal = B_star.

The dip is B_normal - B_spots_visible.

So:

Dip = B_normal - B_spots_visible = [ (1 - f/2) * B_star + (f/2) * B_spot ] 

Wait, no, when spots are visible, the brightness is lower, so the dip is the difference between normal and the spotted brightness. So dip = B_normal - B_spots_visible.

So let's compute that:

B_spots_visible = (1 - f/2) * B_star + (f/2) * B_spot

Dip = B_normal - B_spots_visible = [1 - (1 - f/2) ] * B_star - (f/2) * (B_spot - B_star )

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the fractional change.

The fractional brightness change is (B_spots_visible - B_normal) / B_normal.

But since B_spots_visible < B_normal, the dip is negative. The amplitude is the absolute value, so the amplitude is (B_normal - B_spots_visible) / B_normal.

So:

Amplitude_spots = [ B_normal - B_spots_visible ] / B_normal 

= [ (1 - (1 - f/2 + (f/2)(B_spot/B_star)) ) ] 

Wait, perhaps it's easier to model B_normal = B_star, and B_spots_visible = (1 - (f/2)) * B_star + (f/2) * B_spot.

So the dip is B_normal - B_spots_visible = (1 - (1 - f/2) - (f/2)(B_spot/B_star) * B_star )

Wait, maybe it's easier to write everything in terms of B_star.

B_spots_visible = (1 - f/2) * B_star + (f/2) * B_spot

So the dip is B_normal - B_spots_visible = B_star - [ (1 - f/2) B_star + (f/2) B_spot ] 

= B_star - (1 - f/2) B_star - (f/2) B_spot 

= (f/2) ( B_star - B_spot )

The fractional dip is [ (f/2)(B_star - B_spot) ] / B_star 

= (f/2) * (1 - B_spot / B_star )

But B_spot / B_star = (T_spot / T_star)^4.

So substituting values:

f = 0.2

T_spot = 5000 K

T_star = 6000 K

So,

B_spot/B_star = (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4.

Calculating (5/6)^4: 5^4=625, 6^4=1296. So 625/1296 ≈ 0.482253.

So 1 - (625/1296) = (1296 - 625)/1296 = 671/1296 ≈ 0.517747.

So the fractional dip is (0.2/2) * 0.517747 = 0.1 * 0.517747 ≈ 0.05177.

So the amplitude from the spots is about 5.177% dip.

Wait, but wait a second. The hemisphere is covered with 20% spots, but when the star rotates, the spots come into view and out of view. So the maximum dip is when the entire spotted area is facing us. Wait, no. Since it's a hemisphere, when the star rotates, the spotted area is on one side.

Wait, the filling factor is 0.2 for the entire hemisphere. So the spots are 20% of the hemisphere's area. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (2π R^2) = 0.4 π R². The total surface area is 4 π R². So the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots when viewed from Earth is (0.4 π R²) / (4 π R²) ) = 0.1, or 10%. So when the spots are facing us, the area of spots is 10% of the star's surface.

So when the spots are on the leading hemisphere, the area of the star that is cooler is 10% of the total area.

So, the dip is the difference between the star's normal brightness and the brightness when 10% is cooler.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Because the filling factor is 20% on a hemisphere, which is half the star's surface. So the total area of spots is 0.2 * (2π R²) = 0.4 π R². The total area of the star is 4 π R², so the fraction of the star covered by spots is (0.4 π R²) / (4 π R²) ) = 0.1. So 10% of the star's surface is spots.

So when those spots are facing us, the brightness is lower by 10% of the area times the difference in brightness per unit area.

Wait, but the brightness is a combination of all regions. So the total brightness when the spots are in view would be:

B_visible = (1 - 0.1) * B_star + 0.1 * B_spot.

The dip is B_normal - B_visible = 0.1 * (B_star - B_spot).

So the fractional dip is [0.1 (B_star - B_spot)] / B_star 

= 0.1 (1 - B_spot/B_star )

Which is the same as before, because B_spot/B_star is (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.48225.

So the fractional dip is 0.1 * (1 - 0.48225) = 0.1 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.051775, so about 5.18% dip.

Now, for the exoplanet, the dip is (Rpl / Rstar)^2, because the planet blocks that area. So the amplitude from the planet is (Rpl/Rstar)^2. We need this to be equal to the dip from the spots, which is approximately 0.051775.

So:

(Rpl / Rstar)^2 = 0.051775.

Taking square roots:

Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.051775) ≈ 0.2275.

Wait, but that's not matching the options. The options are around 0.07, 0.11, 0.32, 0.39.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's compute sqrt(0.051775):

0.051775 is approximately 0.0518.

sqrt(0.0518) is about 0.2276.

So 0.2276 is roughly 0.23, which is not among the options. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let's go back.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the area calculation. Let me double-check.

The filling factor is 20% (0.2) on a hemisphere. So the area of spots is 0.2 * (hemisphere area). Hemisphere area is 2π R², so spots area is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

Total area of the star is 4 π R². So the fraction of the star covered by spots is 0.4 π R² / (4 π R²) ) = 0.4 /4 = 0.1. So 10% of the star's surface is covered by spots when they are on the hemisphere.

So, when the spots are facing us, 10% of the star's surface is cooler.

Wait, but when the star rotates, the spots would come into view. So the maximum dip would be when the entire spotted area is visible. So the dip is when 10% of the star's surface is at a lower brightness.

So the dip in brightness is:

( area_fraction_spots ) * ( B_star - B_spot ) / B_star 

Which is 0.1 * (1 - (5000/6000)^4 )

So (5000/6000)^4 is (5/6)^4 = approximately 0.48225.

So 1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775.

Multiply by 0.1: 0.051775, so 5.1775% dip.

So the amplitude is ~5.1775% dip. So the planet's amplitude should be the same.

The planet's amplitude is (Rpl/Rstar)^2. So set that equal to 0.051775.

So Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.051775) ≈ 0.2276.

But looking at the options, the closest is option D) ~0.32, but that's higher. Option C is ~0.11, which is 0.11^2=0.0121, which is much lower than 0.051775.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering whether the dip is due to spots being cooler and hence making the star dimmer, whereas the exoplanet makes the star appear dimmer by blocking light. But the dip amplitudes should be the same. So the exoplanet's effect is (Rpl/Rstar)^2, which is the fractional area blocked. The spots cause a dip in brightness because the spots are cooler, which is a different effect. Wait, but in the problem statement, the situation is that the observed brightness variation (due to spots) resembles an exoplanet. So the amplitude of the brightness variation due to the spots is similar to that of an exoplanet.

Wait, but wait a minute. The spot effect is that when the spots are on the visible side, the brightness is lower. But when the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go out of view, leading to a periodic dimming and brightening. For the exoplanet, the dip is only when the planet is in front, so the shape of the light curve is different (a single dip, or a partial phase curve), but the amplitude of the dip is what's being compared.

So the maximum dip amplitude is the same whether it's due to a planet or due to spots. So for the planet, the dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2. For the spots, the dip is 0.051775. So setting (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775.

So Rpl/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.051775) ≈ 0.2276.

That would be roughly 0.23, but none of the options match that exactly.

Looking at the options again:

Options:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

Hmm. 0.23 is not there. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the effective temperature difference is causing a brightness variation, but maybe the total flux from the spots is calculated differently.

Wait, another thought: the star's brightness without spots is L = 4π R² σ Teff^4. The spots have a lower temperature, so each spot contributes less. The total flux from the spots is the area of the spots multiplied by their temperature^4.

Wait, but in the star's case, when the spots are facing us, the total flux is (1 - f/2) * (Teff^4) + (f/2) * (Teff - 1000)^4. But wait, no: the star's effective temperature is Teff, the spots are at Teff - 1000.

So the flux from the unspotted part is (1 - f/2) * (σ Teff^4), and from the spotted part is (f/2) * σ (Teff - 1000)^4.

So the total flux when the spots are visible is:

F_visible = (1 - f/2) * σ Teff^4 + (f/2) * σ (Teff - 1000)^4

The normal flux is F_normal = σ Teff^4.

So the dip is F_normal - F_visible = σ Teff^4 [ 1 - ( (1 - f/2) + (f/2) ( (Teff - 1000)/Teff )^4 ) ]

But that's the same as before.

So F_normal - F_visible = σ Teff^4 [ 1 - (1 - f/2) - (f/2) ( (5000/6000)^4 ) ]

= σ Teff^4 [ (f/2) ( 1 - (5000/6000)^4 ) ]

So the fractional dip is (f/2) (1 - (5000/6000)^4 )

Which is what I had before, leading to 0.1 * 0.51775 = 0.051775.

So that's correct. So the planet's radius ratio must be sqrt(0.051775) ≈ 0.2276.

But the options don't have that. Hmm. Did I miscalculate?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the dip is 5.18%. Let me recheck the numbers.

(5000/6000) is 5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

(5/6)^4 = (625/1296) ≈ 0.482253.

So 1 - 0.482253 = 0.517747.

Multiply by f/2 = 0.2/2=0.1.

0.1 * 0.517747 ≈ 0.05177. So the fractional dip is ~5.18%.

So the planet's (Rpl/Rstar)^2 must be 0.05177.

So Rpl/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2276.

Hmm, but the options are:

A) ~0.39 → (0.39)^2 = 0.1521 → 15.2% dip. That's much higher.

D) ~0.32 → (0.32)^2 = 0.1024 → 10.24% dip.

C) ~0.11 → 0.0121 → 1.21% dip.

B) ~0.07 → 0.0049 → 0.49% dip.

Wait, none of these match. So perhaps I misunderstood the setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's spots are on only one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view but only for a portion of the rotation. Wait, but the amplitude is the same as the planet's dip, which is a one-time dip. So perhaps the maximum dip is when the entire spotted hemisphere is facing us.

Wait, wait, no. The maximum dip would be when the entire spotted area is visible. But the spotted area is on a hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the hemisphere with spots could be facing us. So the maximum dip is when the entire hemisphere is visible. Wait, no, the hemisphere is facing us, but the spots are only 20% of that hemisphere.

Wait, no the filling factor is 20% on the hemisphere. So when the hemisphere is facing us, the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere.

So the area of spots is 20% of 2π R² = 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

The total area of the star is 4 π R². So the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is 0.4 π R² / 4 π R² = 0.1. So 10% of the star's surface is covered by spots.

Thus, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, 10% of the star's surface is cooler.

So when the star rotates such that the spotted hemisphere is pointed towards us, the dip is 10% of the star's area, each spot being cooler.

So the dip is 0.1 * (1 - (5/6)^4 )

Which is 0.05177, as before.

So the planet's radius must satisfy (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.2276.

But the options don't have that. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the fractional brightness change as the difference between the unspotted and spotted surface.

Wait, another approach: the star's brightness when the spots are on the hemisphere is:

B = B_unspotted + B_spotted.

B_unspotted = (1 - 0.2/2) * Bstar per unit area * area.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the brightness as the sum of unspotted and spotted regions.

Total brightness when spots are visible is:

B = (1 - f/2) * Bstar + (f/2) * Bspot.

Where Bspot = (T_spot / Tstar)^4 * Bstar.

So B = (1 - f/2) * Bstar + (f/2) * (T_spot^4 / Tstar^4) * Bstar.

Factor out Bstar:

B = Bstar [ (1 - f/2) + (f/2)(T_spot^4 / Tstar^4) ]

The dip is (B - Bstar) / Bstar = - (f/2) [ 1 - (T_spot^4 / Tstar^4) ]

Which is the same as before: dip = (f/2)(1 - (T_spot^4 / Tstar^4)).

So dip = 0.1 * (1 - (5/6)^4) ≈ 0.05177.

So dip ≈5.18%.

So the planet's radius must make (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.2276.

But the options don't have that. The closest option is option D) 0.32. But 0.32^2 is 0.1024, which is 10.24% dip, which is higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation. Let me recompute (5/6)^4.

5^4 = 5*5=25; 25*5=125; 125*5=625.

6^4 is 6*6=36; 36*6=216; 216*6=1296.

So 625/1296 = approximately 0.48225.

So 1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775.

Multiply by 0.1 (f/2 = 0.2/2=0.1) → 0.051775.

So the dip is correct.

Wait, but maybe the problem says that the spots are on the hemisphere, and when the star rotates, the spots come into view, but the maximum dip is when the spots are on the edge. Wait, no, that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the star's brightness variation due to rotation is a sine-like curve, but the maximum dip is when the spots are directly facing us. So the amplitude is 5.18% as before.

So the planet's radius is approximately 0.2276 Rstar, which isn't among the options. Hmm. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the dip being the same, but the amplitude of the variation. For the exoplanet, the dip is a sharp dip, but for the spots, the brightness variation is a continuous change as the star rotates, leading to a sinusoidal-like variation in brightness. So the amplitude of the brightness variation is the same as the dip amplitude.

Wait, but the dip amplitude is the same as the exoplanet's dip. So perhaps I'm correct.

But the options don't have 0.23. Wait, maybe I should check the options again.

The options are:

A) ~0.39 → 0.39^2 = 0.1521 → 15.2%

B) ~0.07 → 0.0049 → 0.49%

C) ~0.11 → 0.0121 → 1.21%

D) ~0.32 → 0.1024 → 10.24%

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: the brightness variation due to the spots is a periodic modulation. The amplitude of the light curve is the maximum variation in brightness. For the spots, the maximum dip is when the maximum area of spots is visible, which is when the entire hemisphere is facing us. Wait, but the hemisphere has only 20% spots, so 20% of the hemisphere's area is covered.

Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the star's rotation. The star is rotating, so the spots come into view, leading to a continuous change in brightness. The maximum variation would be when the spots are on the limb, but perhaps that's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is correct and the intended answer is not there, but perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the star's brightness variation is due to the spots being on the hemisphere. So when the star is viewed from Earth, as it rotates, a portion of the spots come into view, leading to a sinusoidal variation in brightness. The amplitude of that variation would depend on the size of the spots and their temperature.

For the star, the maximum brightness variation would be when the spots are entirely on the near side, or perhaps when they're on the limb.

Alternatively, perhaps the variation is modeled as a sinusoid with amplitude A, where A is the maximum dip minus the minimum dip, divided by 2. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should model the brightness variation as a function of the rotational phase. Let's say the star is rotating with a period P. The brightness as a function of time would vary sinusoidally, with the amplitude of the variation being the maximum dip.

But I'm not sure. Let me think. The problem states that the star's brightness variation resembles an exoplanet, so perhaps the way it's presented as a dip is similar to a planet transit. But in reality, the starspots cause a dip that's more gradual, but the amplitude is the same as a planet.

So perhaps the calculation is correct, but the options don't match. So maybe I'm missing a factor.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the effective temperature of the spots is 1000 K cooler than the star's Teff of 6000 K, so the spot temperature is 5000 K. So (5000/6000)^4 is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem states that the star has a radius equal to the Sun, but the exoplanet's radius is to be found relative to the star's radius. So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the filling factor. The filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So the area of spots is 0.2 * (2πR²) = 0.4π R². The star's total area is 4π R². So when the star rotates, the maximum area of spots that can be seen is 0.4 π R², but only when the entire hemisphere is facing us.

Wait, no. Because the spots are on the hemisphere. So when the star's rotation brings the hemisphere with spots into view, the area of spots visible is 0.4 π R². But the total area of the star is 4 π R². So the fraction is 0.4 π R² /4 π R² = 0.1, or 10%.

So the dip is 10% of the star's surface, each spot being cooler by (5/6)^4.

So dip = 0.1*(1 - (5/6)^4) ≈ 0.05177.

So the planet's radius would be sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.227 Rstar.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the question is considering the star's rotation period, but that's not given.

Wait, perhaps I misread the question. The question says the star's Teff is 6000 K, and the spots have a temperature difference of 1000 K. So the spot temperature is 5000 K. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the brightness variation due to the spots is not just the dip, but the modulation over the rotation period, and the amplitude is the peak-to-peak variation. So the peak-to-peak would be 2 * dip. But for the exoplanet, it's a single dip. So perhaps that's not relevant.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the fact that the star's brightness variation due to the spots is a dip of 5% and a rise when the spots go behind, leading to a peak-to-peak variation of 10%, but that's not the case for the planet, which only causes a dip.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the star's brightness variation is due to the spots rotating in and out of view, leading to a sinusoidal-like variation with an amplitude that's 5.18% of the star's brightness. The exoplanet's dip would have the same amplitude, so Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.227. But again, the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's rotation causes the spots to cover a larger fraction of the star's disk when they are on the limb. So the maximum dip is when the edge of the spots is on the limb, making the spot coverage appear larger due to the limb effect. But I'm not sure about that.

Another possibility: perhaps the effective temperature of the spots is not 5000 K but 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K, but I think that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's surface is not uniformly covered, so the brightness variation is more complex. But for the purpose of this calculation, I think the approach is correct.

Hmm. Maybe the intended answer is option C) ~0.11.

Wait, let's compute (0.11)^2 = 0.0121, which is 1.21% dip. That's much lower than our calculated 5.18% dip.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute (5/6)^4.

5/6 is approximately 0.833333.

0.8333^2 = 0.694444.

0.694444^2 ≈ 0.482253. So that's correct.

So 1 - 0.482253 = 0.517747.

Multiply by 0.1 (f/2) → 0.05177.

Hmm. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but the closest is option C) 0.11, which would give a dip of ~1.21%, but that's way too low.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the dip. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: The star's total luminosity is L = 4π R² σ Teff^4.

The spots have a smaller L: each spot's luminosity is L_spot = area_spot * σ T_spot^4.

The total luminosity when the spots are visible is L_visible = L_star - (area_spots) (σ Teff^4 - σ T_spot^4).

So the dip is (area_spots / area_star) * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) / Teff^4.

So dip = (f/2) * ( (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) / Teff^4 )

Which is the same as (f/2) ( 1 - (T_spot / Teff)^4 )

Which is what I had before.

So the dip is correct.

Hmm. Maybe I'm supposed to consider that the star's light curve due to spots is more complex, and the maximum dip is when the entire hemisphere is visible, but perhaps the hemisphere's area is 2π R², so the maximum area of spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

So the dip is (0.4 π R²) / (4 π R²) ) * (1 - (5000/6000)^4 )

= 0.1 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) ≈ 0.1 * 0.51775 → 0.051775.

Same as before.

So I'm confident that the dip is approximately 5.18%, leading to a planet radius of about 0.2276 Rstar.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps the problem is intended to have an answer of about 0.11, which is option C.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the correct dip is about 1.2% instead of 5%.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the change in the star's brightness due to the spots as a percentage, but perhaps the change is calculated differently.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's brightness without spots is higher than the one with spots. So the dip is the difference between when the spots are visible and when they're not.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the spots are on a hemisphere, so when the star rotates, the spots come into view and the brightness decreases, but only a portion of the spots are visible at any time.

Wait, no, the maximum dip would be when the entire spotted hemisphere is visible. So the entire 10% of the star's surface is covered with spots.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A) ~0.39 → 0.1521 dip

B) ~0.07 → 0.0049 dip

C) ~0.11 → 0.0121 dip

D) ~0.32 → 0.1024 dip.

Our calculated dip is 0.05177, which is about 5.18% dip.

So the only option that's in the same range is option D (10% dip) and option A (15% dip).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the dip. Let me recompute.

Wait, perhaps the star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. So the spot temperature is 5000 K.

So the ratio is (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 = 0.48225.

So 1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775.

Multiply by 0.1 (since f/2 is 0.1) → 0.051775 dip.

So the dip is 5.1775%, which is approximately 5.18%.

So the planet's radius must be sqrt(0.051775) ≈ 0.2276 Rstar.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the intended answer is option C) 0.11, but that's 1.21% dip. Or perhaps I'm missing a factor of sqrt(2).

Wait, perhaps the dip is when the spots are on the limb, making the area appear larger. The area blocking would then be the area of the circle as seen from Earth, which is (Rpl)^2, but when on the limb, the effective area is larger. Wait, no, the maximum dip is when the planet is directly in front, blocking the maximum area.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I'll go with the calculation I have and see if any of the options match. Perhaps the intended answer is option C) ~0.11, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but the closest is option C.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the planet's radius such that the amplitude of the light curve (the depth) is equal to the dip from the spots. So the planet's radius is ~0.227 Rstar, which is approximately 0.23. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but option D is 0.32. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the filling factor.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface, not just the hemisphere. But the problem states that only one hemisphere is spotty, and the filling factor is 20% of that hemisphere.

So, the area of spots is 0.2*(2π R²) = 0.4 π R².

The star's total area is 4 π R².

So the fraction is 0.4 π R² /4 π R² = 0.1, which is correct.

Hmm.

I think I've spent enough time on this. Based on my calculations, the correct Rpl/Rstar is approximately 0.2276, which isn't among the options. But perhaps the intended answer is option C) 0.11, which would imply a lower dip. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the dip as the product of the area of the spots and the temperature difference, but perhaps I should also account for the fact that the spots are on the hemisphere, leading to a different calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the total flux from the star as a function of the spotted area.

Flux when spots are visible: F = F_unspotted + F_spotted.

F_unspotted = (1 - f/2) * F0, where F0 is the flux per unit area (sigma Teff^4).

F_spotted = (f/2) * sigma T_spot^4.

So F_visible = (1 - f/2) F0 + (f/2) F_spot.

The dip is F_normal - F_visible = F0 - F_visible.

= F0 [ 1 - (1 - f/2) - (f/2) (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) ]

= F0 [ f/2 (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4)) ]

So the fractional dip is (f/2) (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4)).

Which is what I had before.

So, I think my calculation is correct. Therefore, the answer isn't listed, but perhaps the intended answer is option C) ~0.11, but that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the dip is 5.18%, and the exoplanet's dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.0518 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.2276.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute the dip.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the star's brightness is dominated by the hotter regions. So when the spots are visible, the brightness is reduced, but the reduction is f times the temperature difference.

Wait, perhaps the dip is f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)^4 ), but that would be 0.2 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.10355, which is a 10.35% dip. So Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.322, which is approximately 0.32, which is option D.

Ah! That must be it. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier by considering the filling factor as 0.1 instead of 0.2.

Wait, the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

The star's total area is 4 π R².

So the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is 0.4 π R² /4 π R² = 0.1.

But perhaps the problem is considering the entire hemisphere, so when the star rotates, the spots cover 20% of the star's visible surface, making the dip 0.2 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) ≈ 0.2 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.10355, or 10.35% dip.

So Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.322, which is option D) ~0.32.

Ah! So I think I made a mistake earlier by taking f/2 into account. But perhaps the filling factor is 20% of the entire visible area when the hemisphere is facing us. So the correct calculation would be f = 0.2, leading to dip = 0.2 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.10355 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.322.

So the correct answer is option D) ~0.32.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star, we analyze the problem as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: Equal to the Sun's radius, \( R_{\text{star}} \).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%.
   - Spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of \( 1000 \, \text{K} \), so \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation**:
   - The spots cause a periodic dimming of the star's brightness as the star rotates.
   - The amplitude of this dimming depends on the area of the spots and their temperature difference relative to the star.

3. **Comparison to Exoplanet**:
   - The goal is to find the radius of an exoplanet, \( R_{\text{pl}} \), such that the dip in brightness caused by the exoplanet transiting the star matches the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots.

---

### Analysis:
1. **Fraction of Star Covered by Spots**:
   - The filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. The hemisphere's surface area is \( 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \), so the area of the spots is:
     \[
     A_{\text{spots}} = 0.2 \times 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 = 0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2.
     \]
   - The total surface area of the star is \( 4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \). Thus, the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is:
     \[
     f_{\text{spot}} = \frac{A_{\text{spots}}}{A_{\text{star}}} = \frac{0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2}{4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2} = 0.1.
     \]

2. **Brightness Variation Due to Spots**:
   - The brightness of the star is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature:
     \[
     B \propto T^4.
     \]
   - The normal brightness of the star is \( B_{\text{normal}} \propto T_{\text{eff}}^4 \).
   - When the spots are visible, the brightness is reduced. The fractional dip in brightness is:
     \[
     \text{Dip} = f_{\text{spot}} \times \left( 1 - \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \right).
     \]
   - Substituting values:
     \[
     \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} = \frac{5000}{6000} = \frac{5}{6}, \quad \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 \approx 0.48225.
     \]
     \[
     \text{Dip} = 0.1 \times \left( 1 - 0.48225 \right) = 0.1 \times 0.51775 \approx 0.051775.
     \]
   - The dip corresponds to a fractional brightness reduction of approximately \( 5.18\% \).

3. **Exoplanet Brightness Variation**:
   - The dip caused by an exoplanet transiting the star is proportional to the square of the planet-to-star radius ratio:
     \[
     \text{Dip}_{\text{planet}} = \left( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2.
     \]
   - To match the dip caused by the spots, set:
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.051775.
     \]
   - Solving for \( R_{\text{pl}} / R_{\text{star}} \):
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.051775} \approx 0.2276.
     \]

4. **Comparison with Options**:
   - The calculated value \( R_{\text{pl}} / R_{\text{star}} \approx 0.2276 \) does not match any of the provided options exactly.
   - However, if the problem instead assumes that the filling factor applies to the entire star (not just the hemisphere), the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots becomes \( f_{\text{spot}} = 0.2 \). Recomputing the dip:
     \[
     \text{Dip} = 0.2 \times \left( 1 - \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 \right) = 0.2 \times 0.51775 \approx 0.10355.
     \]
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.10355} \approx 0.322.
     \]
   - This matches closely with option **D) ~0.32**.

---

### Conclusion:
The most consistent answer, assuming the filling factor applies to the entire star, is **D) ~0.32**.
