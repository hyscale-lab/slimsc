Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think it through. The question says that the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The given formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of calcium ions.

Wait, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, which I think is written as CaY²⁻ maybe? And the formation constant, Kf, tells us about the stability of the complex. So the higher the Kf, the more stable the complex.

The question is about the concentration of free calcium ions in the solution. Oh right, because EDTA binds to Ca²+ and forms this complex, so the free Ca²+ concentration will be low. I think I need to use the formation constant equation to find [Ca²+].

The formation constant equation is Kf = [CaY²⁻]/([Ca²+][EDTA]). Since the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex, that means [CaY²⁻] is 0.02 M. But wait, what about the concentration of free EDTA? Because EDTA can be in different forms depending on the pH. Oh, but the problem says the pH is ideal, which probably means that EDTA is in its most suitable form, like Y^4- maybe.

Wait, but in the problem, they probably assume that all the EDTA is available as Y^4- because the pH is ideal. So the concentration of Y^4- would be equal to the concentration of free EDTA, right? Or do I need to consider the total EDTA concentration?

Wait, no. The solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration of Ca-EDTA is 0.02 M. That means that [CaY²⁻] is 0.02 M. So when it dissociates, it releases Ca²+ and Y^4-.

Wait, but if the complex is 0.02 M, then the concentration of Ca²+ would be x, and Y^4- would be x as well, assuming that each complex gives one Ca²+ and one Y^4- when it dissociates. Wait, no, because the complex is in solution, and the dissociation is CaY²⁻ ↔ Ca²+ + Y^4-.

So the formation constant Kf is [CaY²⁻]/([Ca²+][Y^4-]) = 5e10.

We can rearrange this to find [Ca²+] = [CaY²⁻]/(Kf * [Y^4-]).

But wait, the problem says that the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. So [CaY²⁻] is 0.02 M. But what about the concentrations of Ca²+ and Y^4-?

Wait, but in solution, the complex can dissociate. Let me think: Let's let the concentration of Ca²+ be x. Then, because each complex dissociates into one Ca²+ and one Y^4-, the concentration of Y^4- would also be x. Because for each mole of CaY²⁻ that dissociates, it gives one mole of each ion. So if [Ca²+] is x, [Y^4-] is x.

So plugging into Kf equation:

Kf = [CaY²⁻]/( [Ca²+][Y^4-] ) = (0.02)/(x * x) = 0.02/(x²) = 5e10.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because if I plug that in, 0.02/(x²) = 5e10, then x² = 0.02/(5e10) = 4e-13. So x is sqrt(4e-13) which is 2e-6.5? Wait, wait, actually 4e-13 is 4 x10^(-13), so square root is 2e-6.5? Wait, 1e-13's square root is 1e-6.5, which is about 3.16e-7. Wait, 4e-13 is (2e-6.5)^2, so square root is 2e-6.5, which is approximately 6.32e-7 M.

Wait, but that would make [Ca²+] = x around 6.3e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. Hmm, that's one of the choices.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought when you have a complex in solution, the [Ca²+] is given by [Ca²+] = [CaY²⁻]/(Kf * [Y^4-]).

Wait, but if I assume that [Y^4-] is the same as [Ca²+] because each complex gives one of each, then yeah, the calculation seems correct.

Wait, but is that correct? Because if you have 0.02 M CaY²⁻, and it dissociates into x Ca²+ and x Y^4-, then the total EDTA in solution is x plus the any other forms, but wait, the problem states that the pH is ideal, which probably means that Y^4- is the dominant form, so [Y^4-] = x.

So, using that, the equation becomes Kf = (0.02) / (x * x) = 5e10.

So, 0.02 = (5e10) * x² → x² = 0.02/(5e10) = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 is 4 *1e-13, so square root is sqrt(4)*sqrt(1e-13) = 2*1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7, so 2*3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7 M.

So that's approximately 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.

Wait, but another thought: the problem says the solution is "0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex." So, I'm assuming that the total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So the initial amount of CaY²⁻ is 0.02 M. But when it dissociates, each mole of CaY²⁻ gives one mole of Ca²+ and one of Y^4-. So, without any other sources of EDTA, the concentration of Y^4- would be x, and same for Ca²+.

So yes, the calculation seems correct. So option C is the answer.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant equation:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{Y}^{4-}]}
\]

Here, \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \), and the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex, \([\text{CaY}^{2-}]\), is 0.02 M. Assuming the pH is ideal, all EDTA is in the form \(\text{Y}^{4-}\), and the dissociation of the complex gives equal concentrations of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{Y}^{4-}\), denoted as \(x\). Thus, \([\text{Ca}^{2+}] = [\text{Y}^{4-}] = x\).

Substituting into the equation:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]}{x^2}
\]

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}}
\]

\[
x^2 = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is \( [\text{Ca}^{2+}] = 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
