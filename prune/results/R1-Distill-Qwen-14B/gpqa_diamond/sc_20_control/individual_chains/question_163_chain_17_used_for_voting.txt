Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Hmm, the question is about dissolving iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)3, in a strong acid. I remember that when a hydroxide reacts with an acid, they undergo a neutralization reaction. Let me think about the steps involved.

First, the problem states that we have 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3. The goal is to dissolve this in 100 cm³ of solution using a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid. They're asking for the minimum volume of this acid needed and the pH of the resulting solution.

Wait, Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, right? So when it reacts with a strong acid like HCl, it should form Fe³+ ions, water, and Cl- ions. The reaction should look something like this:

Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe³+ + 3H2O.

But wait, I think I need to balance it properly. Let me write the equation again. Oh right, Fe(OH)3 has three OH groups, so it would need three H+ ions to neutralize each OH- group. So the balanced equation is:

Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe³+ + 3H2O.

So the mole ratio of Fe(OH)3 to H+ is 1:3.

First, I need to find out how many moles of Fe(OH)3 are in 0.1 grams. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is needed. Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, and H is 1. So:

Fe: 55.85
Each OH- group: 17 (16+1)
Three OH groups: 3*17=51.
So total molar mass is 55.85 +51 = 106.85 g/mol.

Moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 moles. Let me compute that more accurately. 0.1 divided by 106.85.

Let me calculate 106.85 * 9.36e-4. Wait, let me compute 0.1 / 106.85.

Hmm, 106.85 times 0.000936 is about 0.1. So 0.000936 moles.

Now, each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+ for the reaction. So moles of H+ needed = 3 * 0.000936 ≈ 0.002808 moles.

Wait, but the acid solution is 0.1 M, so the volume of acid needed (V) is moles divided by concentration. So V = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 liters, which is 28.08 cm³. Hmm, so looking at the options, option C says 28.05 cm³, which is very close. So that's probably the correct volume.

But wait, wait a second. The problem says 100 cm³ is the total volume of the solution. So does that mean the acid volume plus the Fe(OH)3 solution is 100 cm³? Or is the total volume after adding the acid 100 cm³?

Wait, the problem states "dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume." So the total volume after dissolving is 100 cm³. So the volume of acid we add can't be more than 100 cm³, but likely it's less because we're adding the acid to the Fe(OH)3. Wait, but Fe(OH)3 is a solid, right? So when you add acid, the volume may increase, but the problem says the total volume is 100 cm³. Hmm, but maybe I should consider that the solution ends up being 100 cm³. So when I add V cm³ of acid, the total volume is 100 cm³. Or is the initial solution before adding Fe(OH)3 100 cm³?

Wait, the problem says that the total volume is 100 cm³. So I think that the 100 cm³ is the final volume after adding the acid and dissolving Fe(OH)3. So when I add the acid, the volume becomes 100 cm³. So in that case, the solution after reaction is 100 cm³.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum volume of the acid needed. So perhaps I need to calculate the moles of H+ required, get the volume from that, and then see if the solution's volume is 100 cm³.

Wait, let's think again. The problem says "dissolve in 100 cm3 total volume." So the total solution after dissolving is 100 cm³. So when the acid is added, it's part of that 100 cm³. So the volume of acid is V, which is part of 100 cm³.

Wait, but does the Fe(OH)3 contribute to the volume? Probably not, because it's a solid. So when you add V cm³ of acid, the total solution is V + any volume from the Fe(OH)3, but since it's a solid, it's negligible. So the total solution volume is approximately V cm³. But the problem says the total solution is 100 cm³. So perhaps the volume of acid is V = 100 cm³? That can't be right because then the H+ concentration would be 0.1 M, but that's not considering the Fe(OH)3.

Wait, no, perhaps I've got this wrong. Let me approach it differently.

The Fe(OH)3 is added to the acid solution, and the resulting solution has a volume of 100 cm³. So the volume of the acid added (V) plus the volume of the Fe(OH)3 solution (but Fe(OH)3 is a solid, so maybe negligible) equals approximately 100 cm³. So the volume of acid would be close to 100 cm³, but perhaps that's not necessary. Wait, no, because we're adding a certain volume of acid to dissolve the Fe(OH)3, and the total solution ends up being 100 cm³.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the acid is diluted into 100 cm³. So when you add V cm³ of 0.1 M acid, you dilute it into a 100 cm³ solution. So the concentration of H+ from the acid would be (0.1 M * V) / 100 cm³ = (0.1 * V) / 100 M.

But that's not all, because when Fe(OH)3 dissolves, it releases OH- ions which would react with H+.

Wait, maybe I should model the reaction more accurately.

The reaction is Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe³+ + 3H2O.

So the moles of Fe(OH)3 are 0.000936 moles, so it requires 0.002808 moles of H+.

So the amount of strong acid needed to provide that H+ is 0.002808 moles. Since the acid is monobasic and strong, the moles of H+ equal the moles of the acid. So the volume is 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm³.

But wait, the problem states that the total solution volume is 100 cm³. So if I add 28.08 cm³ of acid, and the Fe(OH)3 is a solid, the total solution volume is about 28.08 cm³ plus the volume of Fe(OH)3 solution, but if Fe(OH)3 is a solid, maybe that volume is negligible. So the total volume would be approximately 28.08 cm³, but the problem says it's 100 cm³. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. It says "dissolve in 100 cm³ total volume." So when you add the acid, the solution's total volume will be 100 cm³. So the acid's volume is part of that 100 cm³. So the acid volume is V, and the Fe(OH)3 is dissolved into this 100 cm³.

Wait, but how much Fe(OH)3 is present? 0.1 grams, but that's a solid, so it doesn't contribute to the volume.

So for the reaction, the moles of H+ needed are 0.002808 moles, so the moles of acid needed is 0.002808, which requires a volume V = 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm³.

But if the total solution volume is 100 cm³, that would imply that V is 100 cm³, but that can't be right because then the moles of H+ would be 0.1 M * 0.1 L = 0.01 moles, which is more than enough. Wait, but perhaps the problem is that the acid's concentration after adding to the solution is based on the 100 cm³.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the total solution. The acid is diluted to 100 cm³. So when you add V cm³ of 0.1 M HCl, the concentration becomes (0.1 * V) / 100 = 0.001 V M. Then, the H+ from the acid plus the H+ from the dissociation of Fe(OH)3—but Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, so it doesn't release much H+.

Wait, but in the presence of a strong acid, Fe(OH)3 will dissolve completely because the acid provides excess H+ ions. So, the reaction is complete, and the amount of H+ needed is fixed.

So perhaps the minimum volume of acid is 28.08 cm³, but since the total volume is 100 cm³, the acid volume is 28.08 cm³, and the rest is water? So the initial solution is 28.08 cm³ of 0.1 M HCl, and then we add enough water to make it 100 cm³. Wait, but that would require adding 71.92 cm³ of water. But that would dilute the H+ concentration. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Alternatively, perhaps the acid is added such that the total solution is 100 cm³, so V is the volume of acid, and when you add it, you have 100 cm³. So the concentration of H+ in the 100 cm³ solution would be (0.1 M * V) / 100 cm³ = (0.1 V) / 100 = 0.001 V M.

Wait, but the reaction requires 0.002808 moles of H+. So the H+ from the acid must be at least 0.002808 moles. So 0.001 V * 0.1 L = 0.001 V * 100 cm³? Wait, no, because 0.1 M is moles per liter. Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of liters.

Wait, let me think in terms of liters. The volume V is in liters. So V liters of 0.1 M HCl gives 0.1 V moles of HCl, which is H+.

The reaction requires 3 * moles of Fe(OH)3 = 3 * (0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol) = 0.002808 moles of H+.

So 0.1 V = 0.002808 → V = 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 liters = 28.08 cm³.

But if the total solution volume is 100 cm³, then the acid is 28.08 cm³, and the rest is water. Wait, but in that case, the solution would be 28.08 + (100 - 28.08) = 100 cm³. So yes, the volume of acid is 28.08 cm³.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about whether the total volume includes the acid volume. I think the correct approach is to calculate the required moles of H+ from the acid, then find the volume needed at 0.1 M concentration. Since the solution volume is 100 cm³, the acid volume is part of that. So the calculation gives 28.08 cm³, which is option C's first part.

Now, what about the pH of the resulting solution?

After adding the acid, the solution contains Fe³+ ions and excess H+ from the acid. So the pH will be determined by the excess H+.

Wait, but wait, let me compute the concentration of H+ after the reaction.

The moles of H+ from the acid: 0.002808 mol.

The solution volume is 100 cm³ (0.1 L), so concentration of H+ is 0.002808 mol / 0.1 L = 0.02808 M.

So pH = -log(0.02808) ≈ ?

Let me compute that. 0.02808 is approximately 2.808e-2.

The log of 2.808e-2 is log(2.808) + log(1e-2) → log(2.808) ≈ 0.448, so 0.448 - 2 = -1.552. So pH is 1.552? But wait, that can't be right because the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me compute more accurately.

Wait, 0.02808 is 2.808 x 10^-2.

log(2.808)= let's see, log(2)=0.301, log(3)=0.477. 2.808 is between 2.8 and 2.81. Let me get more precise.

Using calculator-like approach:

2.808:

We know that 10^0.45 is about 2.818. Because 10^0.45 ≈ 2.818. So 2.808 is slightly less than that. So log(2.808) ≈ 0.448.

So pH = - (0.448 - 2) )= 1.552. So pH ≈ 1.55.

But in the options, the pH values are around 2.04, 2.69, 3.16, or 4.94. So this suggests that my approach might be wrong.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to consider that Fe(OH)3 itself might contribute some OH- ions, but since we're adding a strong acid, the excess H+ would neutralize any OH- from Fe(OH)3. Wait, but if the moles of H+ are exactly 3 times the moles of OH- from Fe(OH)3, then all OH- would be neutralized, and the solution would have Fe³+ and excess H+? Or, perhaps, the solution's pH is determined by the Fe³+ hydrolysis?

Wait, another thought: perhaps after neutralization, the solution isn't just the excess H+ from the acid, but also the hydrolysis of Fe³+ ions.

Wait, no, because if we have enough acid, all the OH- from Fe(OH)3 would be neutralized, and any excess H+ would determine the pH. But the problem is that in this case, the moles of H+ are exactly 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3, so there's no excess H+ beyond the neutralization of Fe(OH)3. So the solution would be neutral (pH 7), but that's not the case.

Wait, but wait. Let me re-calculate the moles.

Fe(OH)3: 0.1g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 mol.

H+ needed: 3 * 0.000936 = 0.002808 mol.

Moles of H+ added: 0.002808.

So, the reaction uses all the H+ added, and the solution is neutral? But that's impossible because Fe³+ is a Lewis acid and will hydrolyze in water.

Ah, right. So the pH isn't determined by excess H+ from the acid, but by the hydrolysis of Fe³+.

So after neutralization, we have Fe³+ ions in solution. Fe³+ is a weak acid (it hydrolyzes in water):

Fe³+ + 3H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

This will produce H+ ions, making the solution acidic.

So the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of Fe³+.

Hmm, calculating the pH of a Fe³+ solution isn't straightforward. Let me think about the steps.

First, find the concentration of Fe³+ in the solution.

Moles of Fe³+ = moles of Fe(OH)3 = 0.000936 mol.

Volume of solution = 100 cm³ = 0.1 L.

Concentration of Fe³+ = 0.000936 mol / 0.1 L = 0.00936 M.

Now, the hydrolysis reaction:

Fe³+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

The K for this reaction is the hydrolysis constant. I think it's related to the Ksp of Fe(OH)3 and the ionization of water.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the formula for hydrolysis of a metal ion. The pH can be found using the formula:

pH = (pKa + pKb + 14)/2 → Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the hydrolysis of Fe³+.

The hydrolysis equation is Fe³+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

The equilibrium expression is K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe³+][H2O]^3.

But [H2O] is constant, so it can be ignored.

Alternatively, K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe³+].

But without knowing K, it's hard to proceed. Alternatively, I can look up the hydrolysis constant or the Ka for Fe³+ hydrolysis.

Wait, I think the hydrolysis of Fe³+ can be treated as a weak acid. The Ka for Fe³+ hydrolysis is around 1e-3. Let me check that.

Wait, I think the hydrolysis constant for Fe³+ is about 5.6e-3. Alternatively, perhaps the K for Fe(OH)3 is known. The Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is about 6e-38 at 25°C.

Wait, but Ksp is for the dissolution of Fe(OH)3 in water. So, Ksp = [Fe³+][OH-]^3.

In the hydrolysis of Fe³+:

Fe³+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

The equilibrium would be related to Ksp and Kw.

Wait, maybe it's better to express the hydrolysis in terms of K.

The reaction can be written as:

Fe³+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

The equilibrium expression is K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe³+].

But K can be derived from Ksp and the autoionization of water.

Alternatively, since Ksp = [Fe³+][OH-]^3, and Kw = [H+][OH-] = 1e-14.

So, from Ksp = [Fe³+][OH-]^3 → [OH-]^3 = Ksp / [Fe³+].

So [OH-] = (Ksp / [Fe³+])^(1/3).

Then, [H+] = Kw / [OH-] = Kw / ( (Ksp/[Fe³+])^(1/3) ) ).

So,

[H+] = (Kw)^(1) / (Ksp^(1/3) [Fe³+]^(-1/3) )

But let's plug in the numbers.

Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is 6e-38.

[Fe³+] is 0.00936 M.

So,

[H+] = (1e-14) / ( (6e-38)^(1/3) / (0.00936)^(1/3) ) )

Wait, no, perhaps better to compute it step by step.

First, compute [OH-]^3 = Ksp / [Fe³+] = (6e-38) / 0.00936 ≈ 6.41e-36.

So [OH-] = cube root of 6.41e-36 → let's compute that.

Cube root of 1e-36 is 1e-12, since (1e-12)^3 = 1e-36.

6.41e-36 is about 6.41 times 1e-36, so cube root is approximately 1.86e-12 (since 1.86^3 ≈ 6.43).

So [OH-] ≈ 1.86e-12 → [H+] = 1e-14 / 1.86e-12 ≈ 5.38e-3.

So pH = -log(5.38e-3) ≈ 2.266.

Wait, but that's approximately 2.27.

Looking at the options, option C is pH 2.04 and volume 28.05 cm³. Option B is pH 2.69 and volume 30.09 cm³.

Hmm, maybe my approach is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that when the reaction is complete, all the H+ added is consumed, and the solution is only from the Fe³+ hydrolysis.

Wait, but I'm getting a pH around 2.27, which is not exactly matching any of the options. Let's see the options again.

Options:

A) 3.16; 32.14
B) 2.69; 30.09
C) 2.04; 28.05
D)4.94; 20.4

Wait, so none of the options have pH 2.27. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Let me re-calculate [H+].

Given:

Ksp of Fe(OH)3 = 6e-38.

At equilibrium,

Ksp = [Fe³+][OH-]^3.

So, [OH-]^3 = Ksp / [Fe³+] = 6e-38 / 0.00936 ≈ 6.41e-36.

So [OH-] = cube root of 6.41e-36.

Cube root of 6.41 is approximately 1.86, so [OH-] = 1.86e-12.

Then [H+] = Kw / [OH-] = 1e-14 / 1.86e-12 ≈ 5.376e-3.

pH = -log(5.376e-3) ≈ 2.266.

Hmm, that's around 2.27, but the closest option is C (2.04) and B (2.69).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Ksp value. Let me check the Ksp of Fe(OH)3.

Wait, I thought Ksp is around 6e-38, but perhaps it's higher. Let me check: Oh wait, maybe I confused it with another hydroxide. Let me recall: some sources say Ksp for Fe(OH)3 is approximately 6 × 10^-38 at 25°C. So that part is correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution isn't just the Fe³+ hydrolysis but also any excess H+ from the acid. Wait, but in our earlier calculation, the moles of H+ from the acid exactly matched the moles needed to neutralize Fe(OH)3. So, after the reaction, there's no excess H+; all of it was consumed. So the pH is determined solely by Fe³+ hydrolysis, which gives pH ≈2.27.

But none of the options are near 2.27. So perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that all the H+ is consumed. Alternatively, perhaps the initial calculation of the volume was incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate the required H+.

Wait, the moles of Fe(OH)3 are 0.000936 mol. Each mole requires 3 H+ → 0.002808 mol H+.

The acid is 0.1 M, so the volume needed is 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm³.

So the acid volume is about 28.08 cm³, which is option C's volume.

Then, the pH is determined by Fe³+ hydrolysis, which I calculated as around 2.27, but the option C has pH 2.04. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise calculation for the pH.

Let me re-calculate [H+].

Given:

[Fe³+] = 0.00936 M.

Ksp = 6e-38.

So,

[OH-]^3 = (6e-38) / 0.00936 = approx 6.41e-36.

So [OH-] = (6.41e-36)^(1/3).

Let me compute that more accurately.

Cube root of 6.41e-36: Let's compute 6.41e-36 = 6.41 × 1e-36.

Cube root of 1e-36 is 1e-12.

Cube root of 6.41 is approximately 1.86 (since 1.86^3 is about 6.43).

So [OH-] ≈ 1.86e-12.

Then, [H+] = Kw / [OH-] = 1e-14 / 1.86e-12 ≈ 0.005376 M.

pH = -log(0.005376) ≈ 2.266.

Wait, but that's about 2.27.

Hmm. So why none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the hydrolysis.

Alternative approach: perhaps the solution's pH is determined by the excess H+ from the acid. Wait, but in that case, we have exactly 0.002808 mol H+ in 0.1 L, which is 0.02808 M. pH would be -log(0.02808) ≈ 1.55.

But that's even lower pH than what I got before. But the options don't have that either.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Maybe not all the H+ is consumed. Let me think again.

The reaction is:

Fe(OH)3(s) + 3H+ → Fe³+ (aq) + 3H2O.

So for every mole of Fe(OH)3, 3 moles of H+ are consumed.

But if the H+ provided is exactly 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3, then all the H+ is consumed, leaving Fe³+ and no excess H+.

But Fe³+ then hydrolyzes, contributing H+ ions, making the solution acidic.

So the only H+ comes from Fe³+ hydrolysis, so pH ≈2.27.

But perhaps I should calculate it more accurately.

Let me set up the equation for Fe³+ hydrolysis.

Fe³+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

The expression is K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe³+].

But I don't know K for this reaction. Alternatively, K can be found from the Ksp and Kw.

Wait, Ksp = [Fe³+][OH-]^3.

K for the hydrolysis can be written as:

K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe³+] = (Ksp [H+]^3 ) / ([Fe³+] [OH-]^3 )) × [OH-]^3 / [Fe³+] ?

Wait, perhaps another approach: since Ksp = [Fe³+][OH-]^3 → [OH-]^3 = Ksp / [Fe³+].

And Kw = [H+][OH-] → [H+] = Kw / [OH-] = Kw / ( (Ksp/[Fe³+])^(1/3) )

So [H+] = (Kw)^(1) / ( (Ksp/[Fe³+]) )^(1/3) )

Putting in the values:

Kw = 1e-14,

Ksp = 6e-38,

[Fe³+] = 0.00936 M.

So,

[H+] = 1e-14 / ( (6e-38 / 0.00936) )^(1/3 )

Compute denominator:

6e-38 / 0.00936 = 6.41e-36.

So (6.41e-36)^(1/3) = (6.41)^(1/3) * (1e-36)^(1/3).

(6.41)^(1/3) ≈ 1.86,

(1e-36)^(1/3) = 1e-12.

So denominator is approximately 1.86e-12.

Thus,

[H+] = 1e-14 / 1.86e-12 ≈ 5.376e-3 M.

pH = -log(5.376e-3) → Let's compute log(5.376e-3).

log(5.376) ≈ 0.73, so log(5.376e-3) = 0.73 -3 = -2.27.

So pH = 2.27.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that some H+ remains after the reaction. Wait, but according to the stoichiometry, all H+ from the acid is consumed.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I forgot to account for the fact that the solution's volume is 100 cm³, so when I add V cm³ of acid, the concentration of H+ is (V * 0.1) / 100. But wait, V is the volume of acid, which is 28.08 cm³. So the moles of H+ are 0.1 * 0.02808 L = 0.002808 mol. Which matches the requirement, so all H+ is consumed. So no excess H+ remains.

Thus, the pH must be determined by Fe³+ hydrolysis, which gives around 2.27.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the pH considering that the solution is Fe³+ in water, but maybe I should account for activity coefficients or something else, but that's probably beyond the scope here.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach is incorrect, and the pH is determined by the excess H+.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction doesn't go to completion because Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, so not all of it dissolves. But the problem states that we want to dissolve it completely, so the strong acid is in excess.

Wait, but perhaps the calculation of the moles of H+ is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is:

Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe³+ + 3H2O.

So moles of H+ needed = 3 × moles of Fe(OH)3.

Moles of Fe(OH)3: 0.1g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.0009357 mol.

Moles H+ needed: 0.002807 mol.

Volume of 0.1 M HCl needed: 0.002807 / 0.1 = 0.02807 L → 28.07 cm³.

So the volume is about 28.07, which is option C's volume.

Now, the pH is determined by Fe³+ hydrolysis. But as my calculation shows pH ≈2.27, but option C has pH 2.04. So perhaps I should reevaluate.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution isn't 100 cm³ yet. Wait, when I add 28.08 cm³ of acid, the solution's volume is 28.08 cm³ (if the Fe(OH)3 doesn't contribute any volume). But the problem states that the solution's total volume is 100 cm³, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the volume of the solution is 100 cm³, which includes the volume of the acid and the volume of the dissolved Fe(OH)3. But I'm not sure how much the Fe(OH)3 contributes, but it's a solid, so likely negligible.

So the volume of acid added is 28.08 cm³, but the solution's total volume is 100 cm³. So the concentration of H+ is (0.002808 mol) / 0.1 L = 0.02808 M. Wait, but this would be the case if all the H+ remains, but according to the reaction, they're all consumed.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the solution is not just Fe³+ but also some excess H+ from the acid. But according to the stoichiometry, all the H+ from the acid is used up. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the Fe(OH)3 isn't completely dissolved, but the problem states that it is. So maybe I need to calculate the pH differently.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the pH considering the excess H+ from the acid beyond what's needed to neutralize Fe(OH)3. But according to the calculation, there's no excess.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the solution's volume is 100 cm³, so the concentration of Fe³+ is higher, which affects the pH.

Wait, let me recalculate [Fe³+].

Moles Fe³+ = 0.1g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 mol.

Volume = 100 cm³ = 0.1 L.

Concentration = 0.000936 / 0.1 = 0.00936 M.

So [Fe³+] = 0.00936 M.

Then, the hydrolysis reaction is:

Fe³+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

The expression is K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe³+].

But K can be found from Ksp.

Ksp = [Fe³+][OH-]^3 = 6e-38.

We can write [OH-]^3 = Ksp / [Fe³+].

So [OH-] = (6e-38 / 0.00936)^(1/3) = (6.41e-36)^(1/3) ≈ 1.86e-12 M.

Then, [H+] = Kw / [OH-] = 1e-14 / 1.86e-12 ≈ 5.38e-3 M.

pH = -log(5.38e-3) ≈ 2.266 → approximately 2.27.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a miscalculation, or perhaps the Ksp is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the acid's excess beyond neutralization, but according to the stoichiometry, there is no excess. So I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options again. Option C has pH 2.04, which is higher than my calculation. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the solution has both Fe³+ and excess H+ from the acid. But that would mean the acid added is more than needed to neutralize Fe(OH)3, which would lower the pH further.

But according to the calculation, the required H+ is exactly 0.002808 mol, so adding any more would lower the pH.

But the problem asks for the minimum volume of acid needed to dissolve Fe(OH)3. So the minimum volume is when all the acid is just enough to neutralize Fe(OH)3, without any excess. Thus, the pH is determined by Fe³+ hydrolysis, which is around 2.27.

But since none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake in the Ksp value. Let me check another source. Oh wait, I think the Ksp for Fe(OH)3 is 6 × 10^-38, which I used, but perhaps it's different.

If the Ksp were higher, say 1e-35, then [OH-] would be higher, leading to lower [H+], and higher pH.

Wait, let's try Ksp = 1e-35.

Then,

[OH-]^3 = 1e-35 / 0.00936 ≈ 1.068e-33.

[OH-] = cube root of 1.068e-33 ≈ 2.2e-11.

[H+] = 1e-14 / 2.2e-11 ≈ 4.545e-4.

pH = -log(4.545e-4) → log(4.545)=0.657, so pH ≈ 3.343.

Still not matching any options.

Alternatively, Ksp = 1e-36.

[OH-]^3 = 1e-36 / 0.00936 ≈ 1.068e-33.

Same as before; [OH-] ≈ 2.2e-11; pH ≈3.34.

Hmm. So perhaps the Ksp value I used is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the correct Ksp for Fe(OH)3. Let me think: I've heard that Fe(OH)3 has a Ksp around 6e-38, which is very low, making it a very insoluble hydroxide.

In that case, the pH would be around 2.27, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the problem is intended to have the pH determined by the excess H+ from the acid.

Wait, but if I had added more acid than needed, then there would be excess H+.

Wait, for example, if I added 30 cm³ of 0.1 M HCl, that's 3 mmol H+.

Moles needed: 0.002808 mol = 2.808 mmol.

So 30 cm³ would provide 3 mmol H+, which is 0.172 mmol excess.

So the concentration of excess H+ would be 0.172 mmol / 100 cm³ = 0.00172 M.

pH = -log(0.00172) ≈ 2.76.

But option B has pH 2.69, which is close. Hmm. But why would we add more acid than needed? The question asks for the minimum volume needed to dissolve Fe(OH)3, which would be exactly the amount to neutralize it, not more.

So I'm back to the initial confusion. It seems that according to the calculations, the pH should be around 2.27, but the options don't include that. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier and the correct pH is 2.04.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate [H+] more accurately.

Let me compute [H+] again.

Given:

[Fe³+] = 0.00936 M.

Ksp = 6e-38.

[OH-]^3 = (6e-38) / (0.00936) → 6e-38 / 9.36e-3 = approx 6.41e-36.

Cube root of 6.41e-36:

Let me compute it more accurately.

Cube root of 6.41e-36 = (6.41)^(1/3) × (1e-36)^(1/3).

(1e-36)^(1/3) = 1e-12.

(6.41)^(1/3) ≈ 1.86 (since 1.86^3 ≈ 6.43).

So [OH-] ≈ 1.86e-12.

[H+] = 1e-14 / 1.86e-12 ≈ 5.376e-3.

pH = -log(5.376e-3).

Let me compute log(5.376e-3):

log(5.376) ≈ 0.73.

So log(5.376e-3) = 0.73 -3 = -2.27.

pH = 2.27.

Hmm. So the pH is approximately 2.27, which is not among the options. So perhaps the intended answer is option C, pH 2.04, which is close to 2.27. But that's not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the approach. Maybe the pH is determined by the excess H+ from the acid.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the pH considering that some H+ remains after the reaction.

But according to the reaction, all H+ is used up. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the solution's pH is determined by the H+ from the acid after neutralization, but that would require adding more acid than needed.

Wait, maybe the problem doesn't take into account the hydrolysis of Fe³+ and just considers the excess H+ from the acid. Let me compute that.

If I add V cm³ of 0.1 M HCl, the moles of H+ are 0.1 * V / 1000 = V/1000 * 0.1.

Moles needed: 0.002808.

If V is 28.08 cm³, then H+ added is 28.08 * 0.1 / 1000 = 0.002808 mol → exactly neutralized. So no excess H+.

So pH would be determined by Fe³+ hydrolysis, around 2.27.

But the options don't have this, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the concentration of H+ from the acid, not considering the hydrolysis. So the H+ concentration is 0.02808 M, pH is 1.55. But that's also not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the pH without considering the hydrolysis, which would be incorrect, but perhaps that's what the options suggest.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the pH to be determined by the excess H+ from the acid beyond neutralization. But in that case, the volume would have to be more than 28.08 cm³.

Wait, let's compute for option C's volume: 28.05 cm³.

Moles H+ = 0.1 * 28.05 cm³ * (1 L / 1000 cm³) = 0.1 * 28.05e-3 L = 2.805e-3 mol.

Which matches the required 0.002808 mol. So no excess H+.

Thus, pH is 2.27, which isn't an option.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the pH to be calculated without considering the hydrolysis, which would be incorrect, but perhaps that's what the options suggest.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the moles of Fe(OH)3.

Let me recompute that.

Molar mass of Fe(OH)3:

Fe: 55.85 g/mol,

O: 16 * 3 = 48 g/mol,

H: 1 * 3 = 3 g/mol.

Total: 55.85 +48 +3 = 106.85 g/mol.

Moles = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol → approximately 0.0009357 mol.

Which is correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think the intended answer is option C: pH 2.04 and volume 28.05 cm³, as the volume matches the calculation, and perhaps the pH is approximated to 2.04 due to rounding or different Ksp value.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that after neutralization, the solution contains Fe³+ and the H+ from the acid, but that would require adding more acid, which isn't the minimum volume.

In conclusion, the correct volume is 28.08 cm³, which matches option C. The pH calculation suggests around 2.27, but perhaps the intended pH is 2.04, leading to option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ in 100 cm³ of solution using a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid, the reaction is:

\[
\text{Fe(OH)}_3 + 3\text{H}^+ \rightarrow \text{Fe}^{3+} + 3\text{H}_2\text{O}.
\]

### Step 1: Calculate moles of Fe(OH)₃
The molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ is calculated as:
\[
\text{Fe: } 55.85 \, \text{g/mol}, \, \text{O: } 16 \, \text{g/mol}, \, \text{H: } 1 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]
\[
\text{Molar mass of Fe(OH)}_3 = 55.85 + (16 \times 3) + (1 \times 3) = 106.85 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]
The moles of Fe(OH)₃ are:
\[
\text{Moles of Fe(OH)}_3 = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar mass}} = \frac{0.1}{106.85} \approx 0.000936 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate moles of H⁺ required
From the stoichiometry of the reaction, 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ reacts with 3 moles of H⁺. Thus:
\[
\text{Moles of H}^+ = 3 \times \text{Moles of Fe(OH)}_3 = 3 \times 0.000936 = 0.002808 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate volume of 0.1 M HCl required
The volume of 0.1 M HCl needed to provide 0.002808 moles of H⁺ is:
\[
\text{Volume (cm}^3\text{)} = \frac{\text{Moles of H}^+}{\text{Concentration of HCl}} = \frac{0.002808}{0.1} = 28.08 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

### Step 4: Determine the pH of the resulting solution
After the reaction, the solution contains Fe³⁺ ions, which hydrolyze in water:
\[
\text{Fe}^{3+} + 3\text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{Fe(OH)}_3 + 3\text{H}^+.
\]
The concentration of Fe³⁺ is:
\[
[\text{Fe}^{3+}] = \frac{\text{Moles of Fe}^{3+}}{\text{Volume of solution}} = \frac{0.000936}{0.1} = 0.00936 \, \text{M}.
\]
The hydrolysis constant \( K \) is related to the solubility product \( K_{sp} \) of Fe(OH)₃ and the ionic product of water \( K_w \). Using \( K_{sp} = [\text{Fe}^{3+}][\text{OH}^-]^3 \), the concentration of OH⁻ is:
\[
[\text{OH}^-]^3 = \frac{K_{sp}}{[\text{Fe}^{3+}]} = \frac{6 \times 10^{-38}}{0.00936} \approx 6.41 \times 10^{-36}.
\]
\[
[\text{OH}^-] = (6.41 \times 10^{-36})^{1/3} \approx 1.86 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{M}.
\]
The concentration of H⁺ is:
\[
[\text{H}^+] = \frac{K_w}{[\text{OH}^-]} = \frac{1 \times 10^{-14}}{1.86 \times 10^{-12}} \approx 5.38 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}.
\]
The pH is:
\[
\text{pH} = -\log_{10}[\text{H}^+] = -\log_{10}(5.38 \times 10^{-3}) \approx 2.27.
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
The calculated volume of acid is approximately \( 28.08 \, \text{cm}^3 \), which matches the volume in option C. However, the calculated pH (\( \approx 2.27 \)) does not match any option exactly. The closest option for pH is \( 2.04 \), which corresponds to option C.

### Final Answer:
The minimum volume of acid required is \( 28.05 \, \text{cm}^3 \), and the pH of the resulting solution is \( 2.04 \).
