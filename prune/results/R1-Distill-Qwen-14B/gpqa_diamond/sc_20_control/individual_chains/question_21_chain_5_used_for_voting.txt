Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let's read the question carefully.

The question is about isomers and some specific compounds. The question has two parts, A and B. Let me break it down.

Part A asks: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which compound does not show tautomerism.

Part B asks: Between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which one will show optical isomerism.

I need to find the correct options for A and B, then pick the right choice from the options given.

Let's tackle Part A first.

I remember that tautomerism refers to the ability of a molecule to shift a hydrogen and a lone pair between two atoms, resulting in different structures (tautomers). This typically involves the movement of a hydrogen from one position to another, often leading to isomerism.

Looking at the two compounds: Benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Benzoquinone is a quinone. Quinones are cyclic ketones. Benzoquinone has two ketone groups in a benzene ring. Wait, no, benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups. Depending on the positions, it can be para or ortho. But regardless, the structure is cyclic with two ketone groups.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. The numbering is 1,3,5, so all the carbonyls are at every other position, making the ring symmetrical.

Now, tautomerism occurs when there's a possibility of shifting a hydrogen and a lone pair, like in keto-enol tautomerism. For that, the molecule must have adjacent carbonyl groups, or at least a hydrogen alpha to a carbonyl group.

Benzoquinone has two ketone groups. Are they conjugated? In benzoquinone, the two ketones are on adjacent carbons if it's 1,2 (ortho) or opposite if para. Wait, I think benzoquinone is more commonly the 1,4-dione, which is para. So the structure is a benzene ring with two ketone groups at opposite positions. So the structure would be O=C6H4=O, but I'm not exactly sure of the structure.

Wait, but more accurately, benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups. So, for example, 1,2-benzoquinone (ortho) or 1,4-benzoquinone (para). Either way, adjacent carbonyl groups would allow for possible keto-enol tautomerism.

Wait a minute, does benzoquinone exhibit tautomerism? Benzoquinone might not have the necessary structure for tautomerism because the alpha positions (the positions adjacent to the carbonyl) might not have hydrogens. Let me think. In a benzene ring, each carbon is connected to two other carbons and one substituent. So, in benzoquinone, the carbonyl carbons are at positions 1 and 2 (ortho) or 1 and 4 (para). So the carbons adjacent to each carbonyl would be attached to the benzene ring. Wait, how does that work?

Alternatively, perhaps the structure of benzoquinone doesn't allow for enol tautomerism because the alpha positions (the positions next to the carbonyl) are either not acidic or don't have hydrogens. Wait, for keto-enol tautomerism, you need alpha hydrogens. Benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups. Let's consider 1,4-benzoquinone: the structure is O=C-C6H3-C(=O) but wait, no, it's a benzene ring with two ketones. The structure is O=C6H4=O.

So each carbonyl is on a benzene ring, and the adjacent carbons (the ones attached to the ring) are each part of the benzene. So their alpha positions (adjacent to the carbonyl) are the ones attached to the ring. So the carbons next to the carbonyls are each attached to two other ring carbons. So do those carbons have any hydrogens? Wait, in a benzene ring, each carbon has one hydrogen unless substituted. So in the case of benzoquinone, each carbonyl is at a position, say, positions 1 and 4. The carbons at position 2 and 5 (adjacent to the carbonyl) would each have a hydrogen. Wait, no, because in a benzene ring, each carbon is bonded to two other ring carbons and one substituent (in benzoquinone, two of the ring carbons have substituents — O=C– groups). So the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are each bonded to two ring carbons and one hydrogen. So they have alpha hydrogens. Therefore, the benzoquinone should have alpha hydrogens, making tautomerism possible.

Wait, but when you have two carbonyls next to each other, like in a diketone, that's a situation where tautomerism occurs. For example, in 1,2-cyclohexanedione, you can have keto-enol tautomerism because the alpha hydrogens are present. Similarly, benzoquinone (if it has alpha hydrogens) should show tautomerism.

Now, what about cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione? This compound has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. The structure is a cyclohexane ring with three carbonyl groups at positions 1,3,5. So the carbons are all adjacent in a way that each is separated by one carbon (since it's 1,3,5), which is like every other position.

Wait, but in this structure, each carbonyl is separated by one carbon, so the ring is symmetrical. Do these carbonyls have alpha hydrogens? Let's imagine the structure. Each carbonyl is on a carbon, and the adjacent carbons (on either side) are part of the ring. So for each carbonyl group, the adjacent carbons would be connected to two other ring carbons and perhaps a hydrogen.

Wait, in a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is connected to two adjacent ring carbons and two other substituents or hydrogens. Depending on the substitution, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyls may have hydrogens.

But in 1,3,5-trione, each carbonyl is on a carbon that's followed by a CH2 group, perhaps? Wait no, the structure is O=C-(CH2)-C(=O)- etc. Hmm, no, I think in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the ring is such that the carbonyls are at positions 1,3,5. So each of those positions is a carbonyl, so the structure is O=C-C(=O)-C-O-C-C(=O) arranged in a ring. Wait, that can't be right because cyclohexane has six carbons, so the positions are 1,3,5, each with a carbonyl. So each carbonyl is separated by one carbon (like 1, 3,5). So the ring would have three carbonyls, each at every other position.

Now, the carbonyl groups are at 1,3,5, so the adjacent carbons (like 2, 6 for position 1; 4,2 for position 3; etc.) are each between two carbonyl groups. So each of those adjacent carbons would be connected to two ring carbons (so perhaps they are CH2 groups). Wait, but in this case, each of those adjacent carbons is between two carbonyl groups. So they would have two substituents (the two adjacent carbonyls), but how many hydrogens?

Wait, perhaps the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione are each bonded to two ring carbons, making them each CH2 groups. Wait, but in a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is bonded to two adjacent ring carbons and two substituents. So in the case of trione, each of the three carbonyl carbons is connected to two CH2 groups (on either side), which are connected to other carbonyls.

Wait, maybe I should draw it mentally. The cyclohexane ring has six carbons. Positions 1,3,5 are carbonyls. So each of these positions is a carbonyl (O=C-). So the structure would be O=C-C-O-C-C-O-C-C?, no, that's not right. Wait, perhaps it's O=C-C-O-C-C-O-C- arranged in a ring? No, that can't be because each is connected to the next. Alternatively, each carbonyl is on a carbon, and the next carbon is CH2, then another carbonyl, etc. So the arrangement is something like O=C-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2, but that's six carbons. Wait, no, because 1,3,5 would require that. So the carbons in positions 2,4,6 would be CH2 groups. So each of those has two CH2 groups attached, meaning each of those has two CH2 groups, but actually, each of their adjacent carbons is a carbonyl.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused, maybe I should think differently. In any case, the key point is whether each of these compounds has alpha hydrogens, which are necessary for tautomerism.

Benzoquinone: I think it does have alpha hydrogens, so it can tautomerize.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: Each of the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the CH2 groups) would have two hydrogens each. So each of those CH2 groups is adjacent to a carbonyl, so they have alpha hydrogens. Hence, they should be able to undergo keto-enol tautomerism.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: Tautomerism requires that the molecule can form an enol. The enol form has a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl group. For that, the molecule must have a hydrogen alpha to the carbonyl.

In 1,3,5-trione, each of the CH2 groups adjacent to carbonyl would have two hydrogens. So each can lose a hydrogen (alpha to the carbonyl) to form an enol. So the molecule can tautomerize.

If both benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione have alpha hydrogens, then which one does not show tautomerism? Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, another possibility: In some cases, the molecule might not have the necessary structure for tautomerism. For example, if the carbonyls are conjugated in such a way that the enol form is not possible.

Wait, benzoquinone is a 1,4-dione. So two carbonyl groups opposite each other on the benzene ring. The alpha positions (adjacent carbons) have hydrogens. So the molecule can undergo keto-enol tautomerism, forming an enol.

But wait, another thought: Benzoquinone is a fully conjugated system. So the enol form might not be possible because the adjacent position is a ring carbon, which is already sp² hybridized. Wait, but in the case of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the ring is six-membered with three ketones. The adjacent carbons are CH2 groups, which are sp³. So those can form enols.

Wait, but benzoquinone is a conjugated system. So in the keto form, it's O=C6H4=O. In the enol form, it would have a double bond between the two carbonyls. But wait, in a benzene ring, the positions are fixed. So maybe the enol form would require a different arrangement, but the benzene ring can't change the positions. Hmm, perhaps benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism because the enol form would not be possible without breaking the aromaticity of the benzene ring.

Wait, that's an interesting point. The benzene ring already has a fixed structure. If benzoquinone were to undergo tautomerism, the enol form would require a double bond between the two carbonyl groups, but that would disrupt the benzene ring's structure. Alternatively, perhaps the enol form is not possible because the conjugated system doesn't allow for such a shift without disrupting the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps benzoquinone can tautomerize but into a form that isn't aromatic anymore. So maybe it forms a dienol or something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, looking for real examples. Does benzoquinone exhibit tautomerism?

I think that tautomerism in quinones is a possibility. For example, in para-benzoquinone, the structure is O=C6H4=O. The alpha positions (adjacent to the carbonyl) are on the benzene ring and have hydrogens. So, in theory, the molecule could lose a hydrogen from an alpha position, leading to a conjugated diene structure. But wait, in the enol form, the double bond would be between the two carbonyl groups, converting the structure into something like O=C6H4O, but with a double bond between the carbonyl groups. But that's not possible because the benzene ring is already a conjugated system.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up things. Alternatively, perhaps the question is whether the compound can exhibit keto-enol tautomerism. In that case, benzoquinone, being a 1,4-dione, would have alpha hydrogens and could tautomerize. However, in reality, I'm not certain if this is the case.

Alternatively, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione cannot show tautomerism because the structure is such that the enol would be impossible or not favorable.

Wait, another approach: which of these two compounds has no alpha hydrogens? Because if a compound has no alpha hydrogens, it cannot show tautomerism.

So, benzoquinone: each of the carbonyls is at position 1 and 4 of the benzene ring. The adjacent carbons (say, position 2 and 6 for position 1) are each bonded to a hydrogen. So each has an alpha hydrogen. Therefore, tautomerism is possible.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: each of the carbonyl groups is on a carbon, and their adjacent carbons are in the ring. Each adjacent carbon (like position 2,4,6) is a CH2 group, which has two alpha hydrogens. So tautomerism is possible.

Wait, but then both would have alpha hydrogens, so both would show tautomerism, which can't be. But the question says one does not show tautomerism. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another angle: maybe in one of the compounds, the carbonyl groups are conjugated in such a way that the enol form isn't possible. For example, in a fully conjugated dienone (like 1,3-cyclohexanedione), the enol form might not be possible because the double bonds are already conjugated.

Wait, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the structure is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups, each at positions 1,3,5. So the ring structure is O=C-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)- in a ring. So each of the carbonyls is adjacent to a CH2 group. So each CH2 group is between two carbonyls.

Wait, in this structure, the CH2 groups are between two carbonyl groups. So each CH2 group is flanked by two carbonyls. So in such a case, perhaps the alpha hydrogens can be lost to form an enol.

Wait, but maybe the molecule's symmetry makes tautomerism impossible. Because if the molecule is symmetrical, perhaps the enol form isn't possible or isn't favored.

Alternatively, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the molecule is symmetric, so any tautomer would be the same as the original. Or maybe the molecule can't form an enol because the positions are too far apart. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the actual possibility of tautomerism. Let me think of another approach: which of these compounds is a diketone versus a triketone.

Benzoquinone is a diketone (two carbonyl groups). Diketones can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. For example, 1,2-diketones can tautomerize. Similarly, cyclohexane-1,3-dione can tautomerize.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a triketone. So three carbonyl groups. Each of the CH2 groups in between has two alpha hydrogens. So tautomerism should be possible.

Wait, but perhaps in the case of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the molecule is too rigid or the enol form is not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule isn't capable of enol formation because the enol would require a certain arrangement that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is so symmetrical that any enol would just be another form of the same molecule, making tautomerism not observable.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach. Another thought: tautomerism is more common in compounds that have adjacent carbonyl groups, like 1,2-diketones. Benzoquinone is a 1,4-diketone on the benzene ring. 1,4-diketones may not have adjacent carbonyl groups, so perhaps they don't undergo tautomerism as readily.

Wait, but in the case of benzoquinone, the two carbonyl groups are across the ring. So they are not adjacent, but on opposite ends. So the alpha positions (the adjacent carbons) are on the benzene ring. So in that case, the alpha hydrogens are on the ring, but the carbonyl groups are not adjacent. Therefore, the enol form would require a hydrogen from a position that's across the ring, which might not be possible without disrupting the ring structure.

Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone doesn't have any alpha hydrogens. Wait, no, the carbonyls are on the ring, and the adjacent positions (ortho) have hydrogens. So each has an alpha hydrogen.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look for another angle: which of these compounds is a quinone and which is a trione.

Benzoquinone is a quinone, which is a diketone. Quinones are known for their conjugated structures and can exhibit keto-enol tautomerism. For example, in the case of 1,4-benzoquinone, it can tautomerize to form a dihydroxybenzene structure, but wait, no, that's more like reduction. Alternatively, perhaps the enol form would be a cyclic diene with two hydroxyl groups.

Wait, maybe in reality, benzoquinone does show tautomerism. But perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not. Because in the case of the trione, the molecule is so symmetrical that any enol form would just be the same as the starting material, so no tautomerism is observed.

Alternatively, perhaps the trione has a rigid structure that doesn't allow for the necessary movement for tautomerism. Wait, but I'm not certain.

Another thought: The presence of multiple carbonyl groups can lead to conjugation. If the molecule is fully conjugated, maybe tautomerism is not possible because the structure can't shift without breaking the conjugation.

Wait, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the ring is a conjugated system. So each carbonyl is conjugated with the next, but that's not possible because the ring is six-membered and the positions are every other carbon. So the structure would have alternating single and double bonds, but that's not the case. Wait, no, the structure is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. Each ketone is at 1,3,5, so the ring would have three double bonds? No, that can't be because six carbons with three double bonds would be a cumulene, which isn't possible. So the ring is fully saturated (all single bonds) with three ketone groups.

So in that case, the ring is a cyclohexane ring, each of the three alternate positions is a carbonyl. So the structure is O=C-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-, which forms a six-membered ring.

In such a structure, each CH2 group is between two carbonyl groups. So each CH2 has two alpha hydrogens. So tautomerism is possible. The molecule can lose a hydrogen from a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, forming an enol.

But in the case of benzoquinone, perhaps it doesn't have alpha hydrogens. Wait, no, earlier I thought it does. Wait, in 1,4-benzoquinone, the carbonyls are at positions 1 and 4. The adjacent positions (2 and 5) each have a hydrogen. So the alpha hydrogens exist.

Wait, but perhaps the benzene ring's structure doesn't allow for the enol form because the double bond would have to be in the ring, which would disrupt aromaticity. So benzoquinone can't tautomerize because the enol form would not be aromatic, but the molecule is already in a conjugated system that can't change without breaking the ring.

In that case, benzoquinone would not show tautomerism because the enol form would not be possible without disrupting the benzene ring's structure, which would require the molecule to change its aromaticity. So, for part A, the compound that does not show tautomerism is benzoquinone. Therefore, A would be benzoquinone.

Wait, that seems plausible. So the answer to part A is benzoquinone does not show tautomerism, and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does.

Wait, no, the question says which of the two does not show tautomerism. So if benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism, then A is benzoquinone.

But earlier, I thought that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism. So for part A, the correct answer is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism, and benzoquinone does not.

Wait, no, the question is which compound does not show tautomerism. So if benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism, then A is benzoquinone.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong, and benzoquinone can undergo tautomerism. In that case, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would not, which would make A to be cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione as the one that doesn't show tautomerism.

Hmm, but I'm not confident. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let's think about the possibility of enol formation in each.

In benzoquinone, the enol form would have a double bond between the two carbonyl groups. But in the benzene ring, that would create a non-aromatic structure because the ring would have two double bonds next to each other, making it antiaromatic. So the enol form wouldn't be stable, which means that tautomerism isn't possible for benzoquinone.

So for part A, benzoquinone does not show tautomerism, so A is benzoquinone.

Wait, but the question says which compound does not show tautomerism. So if benzoquinone can't, then A is benzoquinone.

Moving on to Part B: Between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which one will show optical isomerism.

Optical isomerism (or enantiomerism) occurs when a compound has a chiral center. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.

Alternatively, other forms of chirality, like axial chirality (as in allenes or certain rings), can also lead to optical isomers.

Let's examine each compound.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: The structure is CH3-C(OH)O-CO-OCH3?

Wait, wait. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3. Then the ester would be methyl ester, so the structure would be CH3-COO-C(OH)(CH3).

Wait, more accurately, the structure is CH3-O-CO-CH(OH)-CH3.

Wait, let me construct it. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. No, wait: propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon, so structure is HOCH2CH2COOH. Then, the ester would be methyl ester: the acid becomes CH3CH2COOCH3, but with the hydroxyl on the second carbon.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me think. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the structure is:

COOH-CH2-OH-CH3? No, that's not right. Wait, the formula for 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is (CH2OH)CH2COOH. So, the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(OH)-.

Wait, no, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. The three carbons are: COOH-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, propionic acid is CH2CH2COOH, meaning the COOH is on the first carbon, then two CH2 groups. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH.

So the structure is:

COOH is on the first carbon; the second carbon has an OH and the third is a CH3.

Wait, no, wait. Carbon 1: COOH, Carbon 2: CH(OH), Carbon 3: CH3.

So the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOH.

Wait, but wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So the structure is CH3C(OH)HCOOH?

Wait, getting a bit confused. Let me write the correct structure.

Propanoic acid: CH2CH2COOH (but more accurately, CH3CH2COOH).

2-hydroxypropanoic acid: The hydroxyl group is on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH.

Wait, but that would be HOCH2CH2COOH. Wait, no, that's 2-hydroxypropanoic acid.

But wait, propanoic acid has three carbons: 1 (COOH), 2 (CH2), 3 (CH3). 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon.

So, structure: HO-CH2-CH2-COOH.

But wait, that's not correct. Let me number correctly. Carbon 1 is COOH, carbon 2 is CH2, carbon 3 is CH3. So 2-hydroxy would be on the CH2 group. So the structure is CH2(OH) connected to the COOH and to CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong. Alternatively, perhaps 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is (CH3)CO(OH)H, which is actually glycolic acid. Wait, no. Glycolic acid is 2-hydroxyacetic acid, which is CH2(OH)COOH.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the names.

Let me try again. The IUPAC name for 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be as follows: the parent chain is propane, with three carbons. The carboxylic acid group is on carbon 1, and the hydroxyl on carbon 2. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH.

Wait, but that's four carbons. No, wait, propane has three. So it's:

Carbon 1: COOH

Carbon 2: CH(OH)

Carbon 3: CH3.

Wait, that's not possible because propane is CH3CH2CH2COOH? No, no, wait. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, which is CH3CH2COOH. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH.

So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH.

Now, its ester would be the methyl ester. So, it would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, that's methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Now, looking for chiral centers. The central carbon (carbon 2) has four groups: OH, CH2COOCH3, H, and CH3?

Wait, wait, let me draw it.

Carbon 1: COOCH3

Carbon 2: OH, CH2COOCH3, H, and CH3? Hmm, not quite.

Wait, structure: the molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

Wait, no. Wait, the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: CH2(OH)CH2COOH.

The ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the structure is:

CH3-OOC-CH2-CH2-OH.

Wait, no, the ester is formed from the acid and methanol. So the -COOH becomes -COOCH3. So the structure becomes:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the molecule is CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH2-OH.

Wait, so the central carbon (the second carbon) has the following groups:

- One hydroxyl group (-OH)

- One CH2COOCH3 group (a propyl group with ester)

Wait, no, the second carbon is connected to the first (CH2COOCH3), the third (CH2OH), and two hydrogens?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the structure. Let me consider the structure step by step.

The molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Propanoate ester: the parent acid is propanoic acid (CH2CH2COOH), so the ester would be CH2CH2COOCH3.

But with a hydroxyl group on the second carbon.

So, structure:

COOCH3 is on carbon 1.

Carbon 2 has an OH group and two CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps it's:

Carbon 1: COOCH3

Carbon 2: OH, CH3, and two CH2 groups.

Wait, no, let me think of it as:

- Carbon 1: COOCH3 (ester group)

- Carbon 2: connected to Carbon 1, has an OH group, a CH3 group, and another CH2 group?

Wait, maybe it's:

The molecule is CH3-OOC-CH(OH)-CH3.

No, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoic acid as CH(CH3)(OH)COOH, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has the structure O

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH(OH)-CH2-

Hmm, perhaps not. Maybe it's better to think about the actual structure.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: the ester is formed from 2-hydroxypropanoic acid and methanol. The acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH, so the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the structure is:

COOCH3 attached to CH2CH2OH.

Wait, so the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Which is equivalent to:

CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH2-OH.

Wait, then the esterification would be between the -COOH and CH3OH, so the structure becomes:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Now, the molecule has the following structure:

The central two CH2 groups, where the first CH2 is adjacent to the OH group, and the second is adjacent to the COOCH3 group.

Wait, but I'm trying to find a chiral center. A chiral center is a carbon with four different substituents.

Looking at the second carbon (the one with the OH group), let's see:

Carbon 2 has:

1. OH group

2. CH2COOCH3 (a longer chain)

3. CH3 (from the adjacent CH2 group?)

Wait, no. Let me number the carbons.

Carbon 1: COOCH3

Carbon 2: connected to Carbon 1, has an OH, and two CH2 groups. Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as:

Carbon 1: COOCH3

Carbon 2: connected to Carbon 1, and has an OH group, and two CH2 groups on either side.

Wait, perhaps that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

COOCH3 is on Carbon 1.

Carbon 2 is connected to Carbon 1, has an OH group, and is bonded to two CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine the molecule as:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

So Carbon 2 is the central carbon.

Carbon 2 is connected to:

- Carbon 1: CH2(OH)

- Carbon 3: CH2-COOCH3

Wait, no. Wait, in this structure, Carbon 2 is -CH2-, connected to the OH group on Carbon 1 and the COOCH3 on Carbon 3.

Wait, no, that can't be because the position is 2-hydroxy.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

The molecule is (CH2OH)CH2COOCH3.

So Carbon 2 (the CH2) has:

- One OH group on Carbon 1.

Wait, no, perhaps Carbon 2 is CH2OH.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me consider each carbon's substituents.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: the structure is CH3-C(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, that would make Carbon 2 (the hydroxy-bearing carbon) connected to:

- CH3 (from Carbon 1),

- OH,

- CH2COOCH3 (from Carbon 3),

- and another CH2 group?

Wait, no, that can't be. Alternatively, the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

So, the three carbons are:

1. CH3

2. CH(OH)

3. COOCH3

So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

In this case, Carbon 2 is the central carbon. It is connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH group (from the adjacent carbon)? Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, Carbon 2 is CH(OH), so it has two substituents: CH3 and COOCH3, and two hydrogens. Wait, no, because if it's CH(OH), then it's bonded to CH3, COOCH3, an OH group, and another CH? That doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw it as:

CH3-C(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, but that's four carbons. No, propanoate is three carbons, so it's:

Carbon 1: CH3

Carbon 2: C(OH)

Carbon 3: COOCH3

So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (Carbon 2) is connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH group (from Carbon 3?), but wait, Carbon 3 is COOCH3, which is a carbonyl group.

Wait, now I'm getting myself confused. Let me consider each substituent on Carbon 2.

- One substituent is CH3 (from Carbon 1).

- Another is OH.

- Another is COOCH3 (from Carbon 3).

- The fourth substituent is a hydrogen? Or another group?

Wait, no, because Carbon 2 is CH(OH), so it's connected to Carbon 1 (CH3), Carbon 3 (COOCH3), OH, and a single hydrogen.

Wait, that's possible.

So the substituents on Carbon 2 are:

- CH3,

- COOCH3,

- OH,

- H.

So four different groups, which makes Carbon 2 a chiral center.

Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and can exhibit optical isomerism.

Now, the other compound is dimethyl fumarate.

Fumarate is the cis-dimer of maleic acid. Maleic acid is a cis-diacid, so its structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but wait, no. Wait, maleic acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, maleic acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, where the two COOH groups are on adjacent carbons connected by a double bond. So fumaric acid is the trans isomer, but wait, no, fumarate is the ester form.

Wait, fumarate is the ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the cis isomer of maleic acid. Wait, no, maleic acid is the cis isomer, and fumaric acid is the trans isomer. So fumarate would be the ester form of fumaric acid.

Wait, but perhaps I'm getting the terms mixed up. Let me clarify: maleic acid is HO2CCH2CH2CO2H (but that's not correct). No, maleic acid is HO2CCH=CHCO2H, with the two COOH groups on either end of a double bond. The cis isomer is maleic acid, and the trans isomer is fumaric acid.

Wait, no, I think it's the other way around. Maleic acid is the cis isomer, and fumaric acid is the trans isomer.

So, dimethyl fumarate would be the diester of fumaric acid, which is the trans isomer. So the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-(COOCH3), but with a double bond.

Wait, the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-CO(OCH3)=O.

No, wait, for fumarate, the structure is O=C-OCH3 attached to each end of a double bond.

So, dimethyl fumarate is CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   |
CH2-CH2
   |
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, that's not correct. The correct structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O-C-OCH3
O
||
Wait, no, perhaps it's better written as:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O-C-OCH3
O
||

No, I think the correct structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O-C-OCH3
O
||

Wait, no, actually, the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

Wait, no. Fumarate is the ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the trans-diacid, so the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, no, that's succinic acid. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, with the two COOH groups on opposite sides of the double bond (trans).

So, dimethyl fumarate would be CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

In this structure, the molecule has a double bond between the two central carbons, each of which is connected to a COOCH3 group.

Now, can this molecule exhibit optical isomerism?

For a molecule to have optical isomers, it must have a chiral center or another form of chirality, like axial chirality.

In dimethyl fumarate, the structure is symmetrical. The double bond is between two carbons, each of which is attached to two COOCH3 groups. So the molecule is symmetrical, and thus, it doesn't have a chiral center. So, it can't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The structure of dimethyl fumarate is (CH2(COOCH3))2C=C.

No, wait, the correct structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

Wait, each of the double bond carbons is connected to two COOCH3 groups. So the molecule is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O-C-OCH3
O
||

Wait, no, each double bond carbon has two COOCH3 groups attached? That can't be right because each can only have two substituents plus the double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2, which is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O-C-OCH3
O
||

Wait, no, I think the correct structure is O=C-OCH3 attached to each end of a double bond.

So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O-C-OCH3
O
||

Wait, each of the double bond carbons has an O-CO-OCH3 group on each side. So the molecule is symmetrical across the double bond. So the molecule is a trans-diesters.

Wait, but in this case, the structure is symmetrical, so the molecule is achiral. Thus, it doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, but another angle: even if the structure is symmetrical, could it have axial chirality? For example, in allenes, axial chirality can exist if there are substituents on both sides of the double bond.

Wait, in dimethyl fumarate, the double bond is between two carbons, each with two ester groups. So the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral. Thus, no optical isomerism.

So, for part B, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and thus shows optical isomerism, while dimethyl fumarate doesn't.

So, putting it all together:

Part A: The compound that does not show tautomerism is benzoquinone.

Part B: The compound that shows optical isomerism is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, but wait, looking back, in part B, the options are:

Option A: A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Option B: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Option C: A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate.

Option D: A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate.

So, according to our analysis, part A is benzoquinone (so A is benzoquinone), and part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (so B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate), which corresponds to option B.

Wait, but wait. Earlier, I thought that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione could exhibit tautomerism, while benzoquinone could not. So for part A, the correct answer is benzoquinone does not show tautomerism, so option B for A is benzoquinone, and for B, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism. So the correct option is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the correct answers for parts (A) and (B), we analyze the compounds provided:

---

### Part (A): Compound that does not show tautomerism
Tautomerism requires the presence of alpha hydrogens (hydrogens attached to carbons adjacent to carbonyl groups) to allow keto-enol tautomerization.

1. **Benzoquinone**:  
   Benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups at opposite positions (1,4-dione). The carbons adjacent to the carbonyls (alpha positions) are part of the aromatic benzene ring. However, the aromaticity of the benzene ring prevents the formation of an enol structure without disrupting the conjugated system. Thus, benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism.

2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**:  
   This compound has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (alpha positions) are CH₂ groups, each with two alpha hydrogens. These hydrogens allow for keto-enol tautomerization, so cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.

**Conclusion for Part (A):**  
The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.

---

### Part (B): Compound that shows optical isomerism
Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:  
   The structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The second carbon (C2) is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups:  
   - CH₃ (methyl group)  
   - OH (hydroxyl group)  
   - COOCH₃ (ester group)  
   - H (hydrogen atom).  
   Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibits optical isomerism.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**:  
   The structure of dimethyl fumarate is CH₂=C(COOCH₃)₂. This molecule is symmetrical, with identical groups (COOCH₃) on both sides of the double bond. Due to this symmetry, it lacks a chiral center and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

**Conclusion for Part (B):**  
The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

---

### Final Answer:
- For Part (A): A = benzoquinone  
- For Part (B): B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate  

This corresponds to **Option B**.

**Answer: B**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let's read the question carefully.

The question is about isomers and some specific compounds. The question has two parts, A and B. Let me break it down.

Part A asks: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which compound does not show tautomerism.

Part B asks: Between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which one will show optical isomerism.

I need to find the correct options for A and B, then pick the right choice from the options given.

Let's tackle Part A first.

I remember that tautomerism refers to the ability of a molecule to shift a hydrogen and a lone pair between two atoms, resulting in different structures (tautomers). This typically involves the movement of a hydrogen from one position to another, often leading to isomerism.

Looking at the two compounds: Benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Benzoquinone is a quinone. Quinones are cyclic ketones. Benzoquinone has two ketone groups in a benzene ring. Wait, no, benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups. Depending on the positions, it can be para or ortho. But regardless, the structure is cyclic with two ketone groups.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. The numbering is 1,3,5, so all the carbonyls are at every other position, making the ring symmetrical.

Now, tautomerism occurs when there's a possibility of shifting a hydrogen and a lone pair, like in keto-enol tautomerism. For that, the molecule must have adjacent carbonyl groups, or at least a hydrogen alpha to a carbonyl group.

Benzoquinone has two ketone groups. Are they conjugated? In benzoquinone, the two ketones are on adjacent carbons if it's 1,2 (ortho) or opposite if para. Wait, I think benzoquinone is more commonly the 1,4-dione, which is para. So the structure is a benzene ring with two ketone groups at opposite positions. So the structure would be O=C6H4=O, but I'm not exactly sure of the structure.

Wait, but more accurately, benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups. So, for example, 1,2-benzoquinone (ortho) or 1,4-benzoquinone (para). Either way, adjacent carbonyl groups would allow for possible keto-enol tautomerism.

Wait a minute, does benzoquinone exhibit tautomerism? Benzoquinone might not have the necessary structure for tautomerism because the alpha positions (the positions adjacent to the carbonyl) might not have hydrogens. Let me think. In a benzene ring, each carbon is connected to two other carbons and one substituent. So, in benzoquinone, the carbonyl carbons are at positions 1 and 2 (ortho) or 1 and 4 (para). So the carbons adjacent to each carbonyl would be attached to the benzene ring. Wait, how does that work?

Alternatively, perhaps the structure of benzoquinone doesn't allow for enol tautomerism because the alpha positions (the positions next to the carbonyl) are either not acidic or don't have hydrogens. Wait, for keto-enol tautomerism, you need alpha hydrogens. Benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups. Let's consider 1,4-benzoquinone: the structure is O=C-C6H3-C(=O) but wait, no, it's a benzene ring with two ketones. The structure is O=C6H4=O.

So each carbonyl is on a benzene ring, and the adjacent carbons (the ones attached to the ring) are each part of the benzene. So their alpha positions (adjacent to the carbonyl) are the ones attached to the ring. So the carbons next to the carbonyls are each attached to two other ring carbons. So do those carbons have any hydrogens? Wait, in a benzene ring, each carbon has one hydrogen unless substituted. So in the case of benzoquinone, each carbonyl is at a position, say, positions 1 and 4. The carbons at position 2 and 5 (adjacent to the carbonyl) would each have a hydrogen. Wait, no, because in a benzene ring, each carbon is bonded to two other ring carbons and one substituent (in benzoquinone, two of the ring carbons have substituents — O=C– groups). So the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are each bonded to two ring carbons and one hydrogen. So they have alpha hydrogens. Therefore, the benzoquinone should have alpha hydrogens, making tautomerism possible.

Wait, but when you have two carbonyls next to each other, like in a diketone, that's a situation where tautomerism occurs. For example, in 1,2-cyclohexanedione, you can have keto-enol tautomerism because the alpha hydrogens are present. Similarly, benzoquinone (if it has alpha hydrogens) should show tautomerism.

Now, what about cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione? This compound has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. The structure is a cyclohexane ring with three carbonyl groups at positions 1,3,5. So the carbons are all adjacent in a way that each is separated by one carbon (since it's 1,3,5), which is like every other position.

Wait, but in this structure, each carbonyl is separated by one carbon, so the ring is symmetrical. Do these carbonyls have alpha hydrogens? Let's imagine the structure. Each carbonyl is on a carbon, and the adjacent carbons (on either side) are part of the ring. So for each carbonyl group, the adjacent carbons would be connected to two other ring carbons and perhaps a hydrogen.

Wait, in a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is connected to two adjacent ring carbons and two other substituents or hydrogens. Depending on the substitution, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyls may have hydrogens.

But in 1,3,5-trione, each carbonyl is on a carbon that's followed by a CH2 group, perhaps? Wait no, the structure is O=C-(CH2)-C(=O)- etc. Hmm, no, I think in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the ring is such that the carbonyls are at positions 1,3,5. So each of those positions is a carbonyl, so the structure is O=C-C(=O)-C-O-C-C(=O) arranged in a ring. Wait, that can't be right because cyclohexane has six carbons, so the positions are 1,3,5, each with a carbonyl. So each carbonyl is separated by one carbon (like 1, 3,5). So the ring would have three carbonyls, each at every other position.

Now, the carbonyl groups are at 1,3,5, so the adjacent carbons (like 2, 6 for position 1; 4,2 for position 3; etc.) are each between two carbonyl groups. So each of those adjacent carbons would be connected to two ring carbons (so perhaps they are CH2 groups). Wait, but in this case, each of those adjacent carbons is between two carbonyl groups. So they would have two substituents (the two adjacent carbonyls), but how many hydrogens?

Wait, perhaps the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione are each bonded to two ring carbons, making them each CH2 groups. Wait, but in a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is bonded to two adjacent ring carbons and two substituents. So in the case of trione, each of the three carbonyl carbons is connected to two CH2 groups (on either side), which are connected to other carbonyls.

Wait, maybe I should draw it mentally. The cyclohexane ring has six carbons. Positions 1,3,5 are carbonyls. So each of these positions is a carbonyl (O=C-). So the structure would be O=C-C-O-C-C-O-C-C?, no, that's not right. Wait, perhaps it's O=C-C-O-C-C-O-C- arranged in a ring? No, that can't be because each is connected to the next. Alternatively, each carbonyl is on a carbon, and the next carbon is CH2, then another carbonyl, etc. So the arrangement is something like O=C-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2, but that's six carbons. Wait, no, because 1,3,5 would require that. So the carbons in positions 2,4,6 would be CH2 groups. So each of those has two CH2 groups attached, meaning each of those has two CH2 groups, but actually, each of their adjacent carbons is a carbonyl.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused, maybe I should think differently. In any case, the key point is whether each of these compounds has alpha hydrogens, which are necessary for tautomerism.

Benzoquinone: I think it does have alpha hydrogens, so it can tautomerize.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: Each of the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the CH2 groups) would have two hydrogens each. So each of those CH2 groups is adjacent to a carbonyl, so they have alpha hydrogens. Hence, they should be able to undergo keto-enol tautomerism.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: Tautomerism requires that the molecule can form an enol. The enol form has a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl group. For that, the molecule must have a hydrogen alpha to the carbonyl.

In 1,3,5-trione, each of the CH2 groups adjacent to carbonyl would have two hydrogens. So each can lose a hydrogen (alpha to the carbonyl) to form an enol. So the molecule can tautomerize.

If both benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione have alpha hydrogens, then which one does not show tautomerism? Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, another possibility: In some cases, the molecule might not have the necessary structure for tautomerism. For example, if the carbonyls are conjugated in such a way that the enol form is not possible.

Wait, benzoquinone is a 1,4-dione. So two carbonyl groups opposite each other on the benzene ring. The alpha positions (adjacent carbons) have hydrogens. So the molecule can undergo keto-enol tautomerism, forming an enol.

But wait, another thought: Benzoquinone is a fully conjugated system. So the enol form might not be possible because the adjacent position is a ring carbon, which is already sp² hybridized. Wait, but in the case of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the ring is six-membered with three ketones. The adjacent carbons are CH2 groups, which are sp³. So those can form enols.

Wait, but benzoquinone is a conjugated system. So in the keto form, it's O=C6H4=O. In the enol form, it would have a double bond between the two carbonyls. But wait, in a benzene ring, the positions are fixed. So maybe the enol form would require a different arrangement, but the benzene ring can't change the positions. Hmm, perhaps benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism because the enol form would not be possible without breaking the aromaticity of the benzene ring.

Wait, that's an interesting point. The benzene ring already has a fixed structure. If benzoquinone were to undergo tautomerism, the enol form would require a double bond between the two carbonyl groups, but that would disrupt the benzene ring's structure. Alternatively, perhaps the enol form is not possible because the conjugated system doesn't allow for such a shift without disrupting the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps benzoquinone can tautomerize but into a form that isn't aromatic anymore. So maybe it forms a dienol or something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, looking for real examples. Does benzoquinone exhibit tautomerism?

I think that tautomerism in quinones is a possibility. For example, in para-benzoquinone, the structure is O=C6H4=O. The alpha positions (adjacent to the carbonyl) are on the benzene ring and have hydrogens. So, in theory, the molecule could lose a hydrogen from an alpha position, leading to a conjugated diene structure. But wait, in the enol form, the double bond would be between the two carbonyl groups, converting the structure into something like O=C6H4O, but with a double bond between the carbonyl groups. But that's not possible because the benzene ring is already a conjugated system.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up things. Alternatively, perhaps the question is whether the compound can exhibit keto-enol tautomerism. In that case, benzoquinone, being a 1,4-dione, would have alpha hydrogens and could tautomerize. However, in reality, I'm not certain if this is the case.

Alternatively, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione cannot show tautomerism because the structure is such that the enol would be impossible or not favorable.

Wait, another approach: which of these two compounds has no alpha hydrogens? Because if a compound has no alpha hydrogens, it cannot show tautomerism.

So, benzoquinone: each of the carbonyls is at position 1 and 4 of the benzene ring. The adjacent carbons (say, position 2 and 6 for position 1) are each bonded to a hydrogen. So each has an alpha hydrogen. Therefore, tautomerism is possible.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: each of the carbonyl groups is on a carbon, and their adjacent carbons are in the ring. Each adjacent carbon (like position 2,4,6) is a CH2 group, which has two alpha hydrogens. So tautomerism is possible.

Wait, but then both would have alpha hydrogens, so both would show tautomerism, which can't be. But the question says one does not show tautomerism. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another angle: maybe in one of the compounds, the carbonyl groups are conjugated in such a way that the enol form isn't possible. For example, in a fully conjugated dienone (like 1,3-cyclohexanedione), the enol form might not be possible because the double bonds are already conjugated.

Wait, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the structure is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups, each at positions 1,3,5. So the ring structure is O=C-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)- in a ring. So each of the carbonyls is adjacent to a CH2 group. So each CH2 group is between two carbonyls.

Wait, in this structure, the CH2 groups are between two carbonyl groups. So each CH2 group is flanked by two carbonyls. So in such a case, perhaps the alpha hydrogens can be lost to form an enol.

Wait, but maybe the molecule's symmetry makes tautomerism impossible. Because if the molecule is symmetrical, perhaps the enol form isn't possible or isn't favored.

Alternatively, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the molecule is symmetric, so any tautomer would be the same as the original. Or maybe the molecule can't form an enol because the positions are too far apart. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the actual possibility of tautomerism. Let me think of another approach: which of these compounds is a diketone versus a triketone.

Benzoquinone is a diketone (two carbonyl groups). Diketones can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. For example, 1,2-diketones can tautomerize. Similarly, cyclohexane-1,3-dione can tautomerize.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a triketone. So three carbonyl groups. Each of the CH2 groups in between has two alpha hydrogens. So tautomerism should be possible.

Wait, but perhaps in the case of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the molecule is too rigid or the enol form is not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule isn't capable of enol formation because the enol would require a certain arrangement that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is so symmetrical that any enol would just be another form of the same molecule, making tautomerism not observable.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach. Another thought: tautomerism is more common in compounds that have adjacent carbonyl groups, like 1,2-diketones. Benzoquinone is a 1,4-diketone on the benzene ring. 1,4-diketones may not have adjacent carbonyl groups, so perhaps they don't undergo tautomerism as readily.

Wait, but in the case of benzoquinone, the two carbonyl groups are across the ring. So they are not adjacent, but on opposite ends. So the alpha positions (the adjacent carbons) are on the benzene ring. So in that case, the alpha hydrogens are on the ring, but the carbonyl groups are not adjacent. Therefore, the enol form would require a hydrogen from a position that's across the ring, which might not be possible without disrupting the ring structure.

Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone doesn't have any alpha hydrogens. Wait, no, the carbonyls are on the ring, and the adjacent positions (ortho) have hydrogens. So each has an alpha hydrogen.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look for another angle: which of these compounds is a quinone and which is a trione.

Benzoquinone is a quinone, which is a diketone. Quinones are known for their conjugated structures and can exhibit keto-enol tautomerism. For example, in the case of 1,4-benzoquinone, it can tautomerize to form a dihydroxybenzene structure, but wait, no, that's more like reduction. Alternatively, perhaps the enol form would be a cyclic diene with two hydroxyl groups.

Wait, maybe in reality, benzoquinone does show tautomerism. But perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not. Because in the case of the trione, the molecule is so symmetrical that any enol form would just be the same as the starting material, so no tautomerism is observed.

Alternatively, perhaps the trione has a rigid structure that doesn't allow for the necessary movement for tautomerism. Wait, but I'm not certain.

Another thought: The presence of multiple carbonyl groups can lead to conjugation. If the molecule is fully conjugated, maybe tautomerism is not possible because the structure can't shift without breaking the conjugation.

Wait, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the ring is a conjugated system. So each carbonyl is conjugated with the next, but that's not possible because the ring is six-membered and the positions are every other carbon. So the structure would have alternating single and double bonds, but that's not the case. Wait, no, the structure is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. Each ketone is at 1,3,5, so the ring would have three double bonds? No, that can't be because six carbons with three double bonds would be a cumulene, which isn't possible. So the ring is fully saturated (all single bonds) with three ketone groups.

So in that case, the ring is a cyclohexane ring, each of the three alternate positions is a carbonyl. So the structure is O=C-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-, which forms a six-membered ring.

In such a structure, each CH2 group is between two carbonyl groups. So each CH2 has two alpha hydrogens. So tautomerism is possible. The molecule can lose a hydrogen from a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, forming an enol.

But in the case of benzoquinone, perhaps it doesn't have alpha hydrogens. Wait, no, earlier I thought it does. Wait, in 1,4-benzoquinone, the carbonyls are at positions 1 and 4. The adjacent positions (2 and 5) each have a hydrogen. So the alpha hydrogens exist.

Wait, but perhaps the benzene ring's structure doesn't allow for the enol form because the double bond would have to be in the ring, which would disrupt aromaticity. So benzoquinone can't tautomerize because the enol form would not be aromatic, but the molecule is already in a conjugated system that can't change without breaking the ring.

In that case, benzoquinone would not show tautomerism because the enol form would not be possible without disrupting the benzene ring's structure, which would require the molecule to change its aromaticity. So, for part A, the compound that does not show tautomerism is benzoquinone. Therefore, A would be benzoquinone.

Wait, that seems plausible. So the answer to part A is benzoquinone does not show tautomerism, and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does.

Wait, no, the question says which of the two does not show tautomerism. So if benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism, then A is benzoquinone.

But earlier, I thought that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism. So for part A, the correct answer is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism, and benzoquinone does not.

Wait, no, the question is which compound does not show tautomerism. So if benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism, then A is benzoquinone.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong, and benzoquinone can undergo tautomerism. In that case, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would not, which would make A to be cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione as the one that doesn't show tautomerism.

Hmm, but I'm not confident. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let's think about the possibility of enol formation in each.

In benzoquinone, the enol form would have a double bond between the two carbonyl groups. But in the benzene ring, that would create a non-aromatic structure because the ring would have two double bonds next to each other, making it antiaromatic. So the enol form wouldn't be stable, which means that tautomerism isn't possible for benzoquinone.

So for part A, benzoquinone does not show tautomerism, so A is benzoquinone.

Wait, but the question says which compound does not show tautomerism. So if benzoquinone can't, then A is benzoquinone.

Moving on to Part B: Between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which one will show optical isomerism.

Optical isomerism (or enantiomerism) occurs when a compound has a chiral center. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.

Alternatively, other forms of chirality, like axial chirality (as in allenes or certain rings), can also lead to optical isomers.

Let's examine each compound.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: The structure is CH3-C(OH)O-CO-OCH3?

Wait, wait. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3. Then the ester would be methyl ester, so the structure would be CH3-COO-C(OH)(CH3).

Wait, more accurately, the structure is CH3-O-CO-CH(OH)-CH3.

Wait, let me construct it. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. No, wait: propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon, so structure is HOCH2CH2COOH. Then, the ester would be methyl ester: the acid becomes CH3CH2COOCH3, but with the hydroxyl on the second carbon.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me think. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the structure is:

COOH-CH2-OH-CH3? No, that's not right. Wait, the formula for 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is (CH2OH)CH2COOH. So, the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(OH)-.

Wait, no, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. The three carbons are: COOH-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, propionic acid is CH2CH2COOH, meaning the COOH is on the first carbon, then two CH2 groups. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH.

So the structure is:

COOH is on the first carbon; the second carbon has an OH and the third is a CH3.

Wait, no, wait. Carbon 1: COOH, Carbon 2: CH(OH), Carbon 3: CH3.

So the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOH.

Wait, but wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So the structure is CH3C(OH)HCOOH?

Wait, getting a bit confused. Let me write the correct structure.

Propanoic acid: CH2CH2COOH (but more accurately, CH3CH2COOH).

2-hydroxypropanoic acid: The hydroxyl group is on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH.

Wait, but that would be HOCH2CH2COOH. Wait, no, that's 2-hydroxypropanoic acid.

But wait, propanoic acid has three carbons: 1 (COOH), 2 (CH2), 3 (CH3). 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon.

So, structure: HO-CH2-CH2-COOH.

But wait, that's not correct. Let me number correctly. Carbon 1 is COOH, carbon 2 is CH2, carbon 3 is CH3. So 2-hydroxy would be on the CH2 group. So the structure is CH2(OH) connected to the COOH and to CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong. Alternatively, perhaps 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is (CH3)CO(OH)H, which is actually glycolic acid. Wait, no. Glycolic acid is 2-hydroxyacetic acid, which is CH2(OH)COOH.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the names.

Let me try again. The IUPAC name for 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be as follows: the parent chain is propane, with three carbons. The carboxylic acid group is on carbon 1, and the hydroxyl on carbon 2. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH.

Wait, but that's four carbons. No, wait, propane has three. So it's:

Carbon 1: COOH

Carbon 2: CH(OH)

Carbon 3: CH3.

Wait, that's not possible because propane is CH3CH2CH2COOH? No, no, wait. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, which is CH3CH2COOH. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH.

So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH.

Now, its ester would be the methyl ester. So, it would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, that's methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Now, looking for chiral centers. The central carbon (carbon 2) has four groups: OH, CH2COOCH3, H, and CH3?

Wait, wait, let me draw it.

Carbon 1: COOCH3

Carbon 2: OH, CH2COOCH3, H, and CH3? Hmm, not quite.

Wait, structure: the molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

Wait, no. Wait, the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: CH2(OH)CH2COOH.

The ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the structure is:

CH3-OOC-CH2-CH2-OH.

Wait, no, the ester is formed from the acid and methanol. So the -COOH becomes -COOCH3. So the structure becomes:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the molecule is CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH2-OH.

Wait, so the central carbon (the second carbon) has the following groups:

- One hydroxyl group (-OH)

- One CH2COOCH3 group (a propyl group with ester)

Wait, no, the second carbon is connected to the first (CH2COOCH3), the third (CH2OH), and two hydrogens?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the structure. Let me consider the structure step by step.

The molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Propanoate ester: the parent acid is propanoic acid (CH2CH2COOH), so the ester would be CH2CH2COOCH3.

But with a hydroxyl group on the second carbon.

So, structure:

COOCH3 is on carbon 1.

Carbon 2 has an OH group and two CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps it's:

Carbon 1: COOCH3

Carbon 2: OH, CH3, and two CH2 groups.

Wait, no, let me think of it as:

- Carbon 1: COOCH3 (ester group)

- Carbon 2: connected to Carbon 1, has an OH group, a CH3 group, and another CH2 group?

Wait, maybe it's:

The molecule is CH3-OOC-CH(OH)-CH3.

No, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoic acid as CH(CH3)(OH)COOH, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has the structure O

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH(OH)-CH2-

Hmm, perhaps not. Maybe it's better to think about the actual structure.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: the ester is formed from 2-hydroxypropanoic acid and methanol. The acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH, so the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the structure is:

COOCH3 attached to CH2CH2OH.

Wait, so the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Which is equivalent to:

CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH2-OH.

Wait, then the esterification would be between the -COOH and CH3OH, so the structure becomes:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Now, the molecule has the following structure:

The central two CH2 groups, where the first CH2 is adjacent to the OH group, and the second is adjacent to the COOCH3 group.

Wait, but I'm trying to find a chiral center. A chiral center is a carbon with four different substituents.

Looking at the second carbon (the one with the OH group), let's see:

Carbon 2 has:

1. OH group

2. CH2COOCH3 (a longer chain)

3. CH3 (from the adjacent CH2 group?)

Wait, no. Let me number the carbons.

Carbon 1: COOCH3

Carbon 2: connected to Carbon 1, has an OH, and two CH2 groups. Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as:

Carbon 1: COOCH3

Carbon 2: connected to Carbon 1, and has an OH group, and two CH2 groups on either side.

Wait, perhaps that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

COOCH3 is on Carbon 1.

Carbon 2 is connected to Carbon 1, has an OH group, and is bonded to two CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine the molecule as:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

So Carbon 2 is the central carbon.

Carbon 2 is connected to:

- Carbon 1: CH2(OH)

- Carbon 3: CH2-COOCH3

Wait, no. Wait, in this structure, Carbon 2 is -CH2-, connected to the OH group on Carbon 1 and the COOCH3 on Carbon 3.

Wait, no, that can't be because the position is 2-hydroxy.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

The molecule is (CH2OH)CH2COOCH3.

So Carbon 2 (the CH2) has:

- One OH group on Carbon 1.

Wait, no, perhaps Carbon 2 is CH2OH.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me consider each carbon's substituents.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: the structure is CH3-C(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, that would make Carbon 2 (the hydroxy-bearing carbon) connected to:

- CH3 (from Carbon 1),

- OH,

- CH2COOCH3 (from Carbon 3),

- and another CH2 group?

Wait, no, that can't be. Alternatively, the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

So, the three carbons are:

1. CH3

2. CH(OH)

3. COOCH3

So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

In this case, Carbon 2 is the central carbon. It is connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH group (from the adjacent carbon)? Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, Carbon 2 is CH(OH), so it has two substituents: CH3 and COOCH3, and two hydrogens. Wait, no, because if it's CH(OH), then it's bonded to CH3, COOCH3, an OH group, and another CH? That doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw it as:

CH3-C(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, but that's four carbons. No, propanoate is three carbons, so it's:

Carbon 1: CH3

Carbon 2: C(OH)

Carbon 3: COOCH3

So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (Carbon 2) is connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH group (from Carbon 3?), but wait, Carbon 3 is COOCH3, which is a carbonyl group.

Wait, now I'm getting myself confused. Let me consider each substituent on Carbon 2.

- One substituent is CH3 (from Carbon 1).

- Another is OH.

- Another is COOCH3 (from Carbon 3).

- The fourth substituent is a hydrogen? Or another group?

Wait, no, because Carbon 2 is CH(OH), so it's connected to Carbon 1 (CH3), Carbon 3 (COOCH3), OH, and a single hydrogen.

Wait, that's possible.

So the substituents on Carbon 2 are:

- CH3,

- COOCH3,

- OH,

- H.

So four different groups, which makes Carbon 2 a chiral center.

Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and can exhibit optical isomerism.

Now, the other compound is dimethyl fumarate.

Fumarate is the cis-dimer of maleic acid. Maleic acid is a cis-diacid, so its structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but wait, no. Wait, maleic acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, maleic acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, where the two COOH groups are on adjacent carbons connected by a double bond. So fumaric acid is the trans isomer, but wait, no, fumarate is the ester form.

Wait, fumarate is the ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the cis isomer of maleic acid. Wait, no, maleic acid is the cis isomer, and fumaric acid is the trans isomer. So fumarate would be the ester form of fumaric acid.

Wait, but perhaps I'm getting the terms mixed up. Let me clarify: maleic acid is HO2CCH2CH2CO2H (but that's not correct). No, maleic acid is HO2CCH=CHCO2H, with the two COOH groups on either end of a double bond. The cis isomer is maleic acid, and the trans isomer is fumaric acid.

Wait, no, I think it's the other way around. Maleic acid is the cis isomer, and fumaric acid is the trans isomer.

So, dimethyl fumarate would be the diester of fumaric acid, which is the trans isomer. So the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-(COOCH3), but with a double bond.

Wait, the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-CO(OCH3)=O.

No, wait, for fumarate, the structure is O=C-OCH3 attached to each end of a double bond.

So, dimethyl fumarate is CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   |
CH2-CH2
   |
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, that's not correct. The correct structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O-C-OCH3
O
||
Wait, no, perhaps it's better written as:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O-C-OCH3
O
||

No, I think the correct structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O-C-OCH3
O
||

Wait, no, actually, the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

Wait, no. Fumarate is the ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the trans-diacid, so the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, no, that's succinic acid. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, with the two COOH groups on opposite sides of the double bond (trans).

So, dimethyl fumarate would be CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

In this structure, the molecule has a double bond between the two central carbons, each of which is connected to a COOCH3 group.

Now, can this molecule exhibit optical isomerism?

For a molecule to have optical isomers, it must have a chiral center or another form of chirality, like axial chirality.

In dimethyl fumarate, the structure is symmetrical. The double bond is between two carbons, each of which is attached to two COOCH3 groups. So the molecule is symmetrical, and thus, it doesn't have a chiral center. So, it can't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The structure of dimethyl fumarate is (CH2(COOCH3))2C=C.

No, wait, the correct structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

Wait, each of the double bond carbons is connected to two COOCH3 groups. So the molecule is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O-C-OCH3
O
||

Wait, no, each double bond carbon has two COOCH3 groups attached? That can't be right because each can only have two substituents plus the double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2, which is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O-C-OCH3
O
||

Wait, no, I think the correct structure is O=C-OCH3 attached to each end of a double bond.

So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O-C-OCH3
O
||

Wait, each of the double bond carbons has an O-CO-OCH3 group on each side. So the molecule is symmetrical across the double bond. So the molecule is a trans-diesters.

Wait, but in this case, the structure is symmetrical, so the molecule is achiral. Thus, it doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, but another angle: even if the structure is symmetrical, could it have axial chirality? For example, in allenes, axial chirality can exist if there are substituents on both sides of the double bond.

Wait, in dimethyl fumarate, the double bond is between two carbons, each with two ester groups. So the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral. Thus, no optical isomerism.

So, for part B, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and thus shows optical isomerism, while dimethyl fumarate doesn't.

So, putting it all together:

Part A: The compound that does not show tautomerism is benzoquinone.

Part B: The compound that shows optical isomerism is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, but wait, looking back, in part B, the options are:

Option A: A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Option B: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Option C: A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate.

Option D: A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate.

So, according to our analysis, part A is benzoquinone (so A is benzoquinone), and part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (so B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate), which corresponds to option B.

Wait, but wait. Earlier, I thought that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione could exhibit tautomerism, while benzoquinone could not. So for part A, the correct answer is benzoquinone does not show tautomerism, so option B for A is benzoquinone, and for B, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism. So the correct option is option B.


To determine the correct answers for parts (A) and (B), we analyze the compounds provided:

---

### Part (A): Compound that does not show tautomerism
Tautomerism requires the presence of alpha hydrogens (hydrogens attached to carbons adjacent to carbonyl groups) to allow keto-enol tautomerization.

1. **Benzoquinone**:  
   Benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups at opposite positions (1,4-dione). The carbons adjacent to the carbonyls (alpha positions) are part of the aromatic benzene ring. However, the aromaticity of the benzene ring prevents the formation of an enol structure without disrupting the conjugated system. Thus, benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism.

2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**:  
   This compound has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (alpha positions) are CH₂ groups, each with two alpha hydrogens. These hydrogens allow for keto-enol tautomerization, so cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.

**Conclusion for Part (A):**  
The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.

---

### Part (B): Compound that shows optical isomerism
Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:  
   The structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The second carbon (C2) is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups:  
   - CH₃ (methyl group)  
   - OH (hydroxyl group)  
   - COOCH₃ (ester group)  
   - H (hydrogen atom).  
   Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibits optical isomerism.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**:  
   The structure of dimethyl fumarate is CH₂=C(COOCH₃)₂. This molecule is symmetrical, with identical groups (COOCH₃) on both sides of the double bond. Due to this symmetry, it lacks a chiral center and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

**Conclusion for Part (B):**  
The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

---

### Final Answer:
- For Part (A): A = benzoquinone  
- For Part (B): B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate  

This corresponds to **Option B**.

**Answer: B**
