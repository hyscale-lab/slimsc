Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an oscillating charge distribution and the radiation it produces. Hmm, I remember from my electromagnetism class that oscillating charges can radiate electromagnetic waves. The question is asking about the fraction of the maximum power radiated at a specific angle and the form of the power function f.

The setup is that the charge distribution is spheroid-shaped with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a certain wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and θ (the angle from the z-axis). The maximum power is A, and we're to find the fraction of A at θ=30 degrees and the form of f.

Wait, I think this has to do with the radiation pattern of a dipole. Oh right, a spheroid oscillating along its axis would behave similarly to a dipole antenna. For a dipole, the radiation pattern in the far field (radiation zone) has a specific angular dependence.

The power radiated per unit solid angle is proportional to (sinθ)^2, but wait, that's for the intensity pattern. Oh wait, for a dipole radiator, the intensity varies as sin²θ. So the maximum intensity occurs when sinθ is maximum, which is at θ=90 degrees, giving sin²(90) = 1. But wait, when θ is 0 or 180, sinθ is zero, so the intensity is zero there.

So if the maximum power is A, the intensity at any angle θ would be (sinθ)^2 times some function of λ. But wait, the problem says the function f is a function of λ and θ. So f(λ,θ) gives the power per unit solid angle. The total power would be the integral of f over all solid angles, but the maximum is at θ=90 degrees.

Wait, the question is about the fraction of A at θ=30 degrees. So if at θ=30, sin²(30) is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. So the power at that angle is 0.25 times the maximum (since the maximum is at 90 degrees, which is 1). So the fraction is 1/4.

But wait, what's the form of f? The function f is the power per unit solid angle. I think for an oscillating dipole, the power radiated per unit solid angle is proportional to (1/λ^4) times sin²θ. Because I remember the Poynting vector for dipole radiation goes like (dipole moment)^2 over λ^4 or something like that. So the function f would be proportional to λ^-4, and also sin²θ.

So putting it together, the fraction is 1/4, and the form is λ^-4. So looking at the options, option C says 1/4 and λ^-4. Option C is option C: 1/4, λ^(-4).

Wait, but wait another second. The question says "the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle θ=30 degrees." Wait, so the total power is A, which is the maximum at θ=90. So at θ=30, the power is (sin²30)*A? Because the maximum is A, and the pattern is scaled by sin²θ.

But wait, no. Wait, the maximum power per unit solid angle is A. So if the power per unit solid angle at θ=30 is f(λ,30), and the maximum is f(λ,90) = A. So the ratio would be [f(30)]/[f(90)] = [sin^2(30)/sin^2(90)] = (0.25)/(1) = 0.25. So the fraction is 0.25, which is 1/4.

So that would mean the fraction is 1/4, so the first part is 1/4. The function f is proportional to 1/λ^4 and sin^2θ, so the form is λ^(-4). So looking at the options, option C is 1/4 and λ^(-4). So the answer would be option C.

The problem involves an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution with symmetry along the z-axis, which radiates electromagnetic waves at a wavelength \(\lambda\). The power radiated per unit solid angle is a function \(f(\lambda, \theta)\), where \(\theta\) is the angle from the z-axis. The maximum radiated power is \(A\), and the goal is to determine the fraction of \(A\) radiated at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) and the form of \(f\).

For a dipole-like radiator, the power radiated per unit solid angle in the far field varies as \(\sin^2\theta\). The maximum power occurs at \(\theta = 90^\circ\), where \(\sin^2(90^\circ) = 1\). At \(\theta = 30^\circ\), \(\sin^2(30^\circ) = (0.5)^2 = 0.25\). Thus, the fraction of the maximum power radiated at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) is \(0.25\), or \(1/4\).

The function \(f(\lambda, \theta)\) is proportional to \(\sin^2\theta\) and also depends on \(\lambda\). For dipole radiation, the power radiated per unit solid angle is proportional to \(\lambda^{-4}\). Therefore, the form of \(f\) is \(\lambda^{-4}\).

From the options provided, the correct choice is the one where the fraction of \(A\) is \(1/4\) and the form of \(f\) is \(\lambda^{-4}\). This corresponds to option C.
