Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics question about the density matrix. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. The question gives me a specific density matrix and asks about its geometrical position in the qubits space. The options are A to D, each with different coordinate triplets.

Wait, the given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Let me write that out in matrix form. Each term is a projector, so |0><0| is a diagonal matrix with 1 at (1,1) and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| is diagonal with 1 at (2,2). So adding them together gives a matrix with 1s on the diagonal. But when you multiply by 1/2, each diagonal element becomes 1/2.

So ρ looks like this:
[ [1/2, 0],
  [0, 1/2] ]

I think this is the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. Maximally mixed states are like the classical states; they have maximum entropy. For a qubit, the Bloch sphere representation is used, right? Any density matrix can be represented as a point on or inside the Bloch sphere.

The general form of a single-qubit density matrix is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector (r_x, r_y, r_z). So if I can express the given ρ in this form, I can find r.

Let me write out the given ρ again. It's (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Alternatively, this is (I)/2, because |0><0| + |1><1| is the identity matrix. So ρ = I/2.

Substituting into the general form: I/2 = (I + r·σ)/2. Multiply both sides by 2: I = I + r·σ. Subtract I from both sides: 0 = r·σ. That implies that r must be zero. Because if r is non-zero, then r·σ would contribute something, but here it's zero.

So the vector r is (0, 0, 0). Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the geometrical position is the origin in the Bloch sphere.

Wait, let me double-check. For a maximally mixed state, like this one, the Bloch vector should be at the center, which is indeed the origin. So yes, the point is (0,0,0).

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

In matrix form, this is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This is the maximally mixed state for a single qubit, which corresponds to the identity matrix scaled by \( \frac{1}{2} \). The general form of a single-qubit density matrix is:

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix, \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) are the Pauli matrices, and \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) is a vector that determines the state's position on the Bloch sphere. Comparing this to the given \( \rho \), we see that \( \rho = \frac{I}{2} \), which implies \( \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0 \). This means \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \).

The geometrical position of the density matrix in the Bloch sphere representation is therefore at the origin. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**C) \( r = (0, 0, 0) \).**

Answer: C
