Okay, I need to figure out which compound is the correct one based on the given spectroscopic data. Let's go through the problem step by step.

First, the FTIR data: a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in FTIR usually indicate O-H (alcohol or carboxylic acid) or N-H (amines) stretches. But since there's also a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹, which is around the region for carbonyl groups (C=O). So 1700 is more likely a carbonyl, maybe a ketone or an ester or a carboxylic acid. Wait, but carboxylic acids have O-H stretches which are usually very broad. Oh, right, the broad peak at 3000 must be from the O-H of a carboxylic acid. So the compound has a carboxylic acid group.

Next, the 1H NMR data: several peaks, none corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. So no double bonds with adjacent hydrogens. So the compound is either a branched or straight-chain structure without any conjugated double bonds.

Looking at the options, all of them have a COOH group. So that fits.

Now, looking at the NMR signals: one is a doublet of triplets of quartets, another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm. That suggests complex splitting patterns, which usually happen when the proton is next to multiple sets of neighboring protons. So maybe the structure has a central carbon connected to multiple different groups, leading to each neighboring set splitting into more peaks.

Looking at the structures of the options:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
So the structure is like this: CH2COOH is at the end, then a CH connected to two C2H5 groups, then another CH connected to two C2H5 groups, and the central CH connected to two CH3? Wait, no. Let me write it out:

Option A: The main chain is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. Wait, the carbon chain would be like: CH3 attached to a CH that's attached to a C2H5 group, then another CH attached to another C2H5, then CH2COOH. So perhaps the structure is CH3-C(CH2CH3)(H)-C(CH2CH3)(H)-CH2COOH.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me look again:

Option A: CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH. So each of the middle carbons (the two CH groups) is attached to a CH3 and a C2H5 group? Or wait, no. The formula is CH3 C(H)(C2H5) C(H)(C2H5) CH2 COOH. So the two middle carbons each have a CH group, each connected to a C2H5. So each of those CH groups is attached to another CH group, but perhaps that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the structure is something like:

CH3-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

Wait, but each of the middle carbons has a CH group, each attached to a C2H5. So each of those CH groups is attached to one C2H5 and one CH2CH3 group? Hmm, perhaps it's better to draw it.

Alternatively, looking at option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

So the structure would be CH2CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So each of the two middle carbons is attached to a CH3 and the other is a CH group. So maybe those middle carbons each have two CH3 groups attached?

Wait, perhaps it's more like:

Option D: The main chain is CH3CH2-C-(H)(CH3)-C-(H)(CH3)-COOH. So the two middle carbons (each attached to H and CH3) are connected in a way that each is adjacent to each other. So perhaps it's a geminal structure with two CH3 groups on each of the two central carbons.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH3CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Wait, but that would make the two middle carbons each attached to a CH3 and the next carbon. But in option D, it's written as CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH, which implies that each of the two middle carbons has a CH group, each with a CH3 substituent. So each CH is connected to a CH3. So the structure would be something like:

CH3CH2-C(CH3)(H)-C(CH3)(H)-COOH.

Wait, but that would mean each of the two middle carbons is CH attached to a CH3. So each of those CH groups is connected to another CH group. Hmm, maybe it's more like a central chain with branching on each of the two middle carbons.

Alternatively, let's think about the NMR signals. One signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. That seems like a very complex splitting, implying each proton is next to multiple sets of neighboring protons, perhaps each with different coupling constants.

Looking for structures where a proton is adjacent to multiple different types of neighboring protons.

For example, if a proton is on a carbon that's connected to two different types of adjacent carbons, each with their own sets of neighboring protons, that could lead to such complex splitting.

Another approach: let's think about each option's structure and predict what the NMR would look like.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

So the structure is:

CH3-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

In this structure, the CH groups are each attached to a C2H5 group and connected to each other. The CH2 group is next to a CH that is attached to C2H5. So the middle CH's have adjacent CH groups.

Wait, maybe the middle CH's are each attached to other CH's, leading to coupling with their neighboring protons.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH.

Which would be:

CH3CH2-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-COOH.

In this case, the two middle CH's are each attached to a C2H5 and connected to each other. The CH2 group is attached to the first CH, and the COOH is attached to the last CH.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH.

Structure:

CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

So each middle CH is attached to a CH3 and connected to another CH which is also attached to a CH3. The CH2 is attached to the last CH.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

Structure:

CH3CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So the middle CH's are each attached to a CH3 and connected to each other. The CH2 is attached to the first CH, and the COOH is attached to the last CH.

Now, looking at the NMR signals. Let's think about each option's possible NMR.

The question says that the NMR has several peaks, but none are vinyl (so no double bonds). So all structures are aliphatic.

In the NMR, one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. Another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. These are complex multiplets, meaning each proton is split by multiple neighboring sets.

Let's think about each structure:

Option A: The middle CH groups are each attached to a C2H5. The CH2 is attached to the last CH. Let's imagine the CH2 group would be a triplet (if next to a CH with two protons?), but wait, the CH2 is attached to a CH which has one proton, right? Wait, the last CH in the chain (before COOH) is a CH connected to another CH and the CH2. So the CH2 would be a triplet if it's next to a CH with two protons. Hmm, but each CH in the middle has how many neighboring Hs? Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the central CH groups (e.g., the two middle CH's) would have more complex splitting because each is next to two different types of protons.

Option D: The structure is CH3CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the middle CH groups has a CH3 attached and is connected to the other CH group.

In this case, the protons on the CH(CH3) groups would each be adjacent to two sets of protons. Let's see:

The first CH(CH3) is connected to CH2CH3 and to the next CH(CH3). So the proton on the first CH(CH3) would couple with the protons on the adjacent CH2 group (CH2CH3) and with the protons on the next CH(CH3). Wait, but the next CH(CH3) has only one proton, so maybe each coupling is with one proton.

Wait, perhaps each CH(CH3) has one proton adjacent to the CH2 group and one adjacent to the other CH(CH3) group. So the coupling would be with two different sets of protons.

Let me try to draw their positions.

In Option D, the structure is:

CH3CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So, the two middle carbons each have a CH group with a methyl attached.

The first CH is attached to CH2CH3, the next CH is attached to COOH. Each of their CH's has a methyl group.

So, the protons on the first CH would be adjacent to the CH2 group (which has two protons) and the next CH (which has one proton). So each of these protons would split into a doublet from the adjacent CH (one proton) and a triplet from the CH2 (two protons).

Wait, but that's two different coupling constants. So the splitting would be a triplet of doublets, or a doublet of triplets. Hmm.

Wait, for each proton, the coupling would be with the adjacent CH2 (two H's) and the adjacent CH (one H). So each proton would have two sets of coupling: with two H's (which would split it into triplet) and with one H (which would split it into doublet). So the overall splitting would be a triplet of doublets (or doublet of triplets, depending on which is first). Similarly, the next CH would have coupling with the previous CH (one H) and perhaps another group.

Wait, but in Option D, the two middle CH groups are each attached to a CH3, and connected to each other. So the first CH is attached to CH2CH3 and to the next CH, and the next CH is attached to the previous CH and to COOH.

So the first CH's proton would be next to the CH2 (two H's) and the next CH (one H). So the splitting would be a triplet (from CH2) and a doublet (from CH), leading to a triplet of doublets. Similarly, the next CH's proton would be next to the first CH (one H) and perhaps the COOH's adjacent CH2 (but perhaps not, because COOH is at the end as -COOH, which is a carbonyl group attached to an OH and an O-H. So the adjacent to the last CH is COOH, which is a carbonyl. So maybe the last CH doesn't have any adjacent H's beyond the CH itself.

Wait, no. The last CH in option D is attached to COOH. So the CH next to COOH would be CH(CH3). Its H would be adjacent to the previous CH's H, and perhaps not any others beyond.

So the first and second CH's H would each have different coupling.

Alternatively, perhaps the first CH's H is split by the CH2 group (two H's) and the next CH (one H), leading to a triplet of doublets. So the signal would be a doublet of triplets, or a triplet of doublets, which is similar to the given data.

Wait, but the given data shows one signal as a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another as a doublet of triplets of triplets. That's a lot more splitting, implying more coupling partners.

Let's think about option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH. So structure is CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

Each CH in the middle is attached to a CH3. So the two middle CH's are each attached to a CH3 and connected to each other. The last CH2 is attached to the COOH.

In this case, the middle CH's H would be adjacent to the previous CH (one H) and the next CH (one H), and perhaps the CH2 group (two H's) for the last CH.

Wait, let's think about the first CH(CH3): it is attached to CH3, next to the previous CH3 (from CH3CH(CH3)-), and connected to another CH(CH3). So the H on the first CH might be next to the H on the second CH and the H on the CH2 (if any).

Wait, not exactly. The structure is CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

So, the first CH is attached to CH3 and to the second CH. The second CH is attached to another CH3 and to the first CH and the third CH (which is the CH2). Wait, no: the structure is CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH. So the first CH is attached to CH3 and to the second CH. The second CH is attached to CH3 and to the first CH and to the third CH. The third CH is attached to CH2 and the second CH.

Wait, the third CH is CH2, but that's not right. Wait, the structure is CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH.

So, the structure is:

CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

So, the first CH is attached to CH3, the second CH is attached to CH3, and the chain continues.

Now, the H on the first CH is adjacent to the H on the second CH. The H on the second CH is adjacent to the H on the first CH and the H on the third CH (which is part of the CH2 group).

Wait, the third CH is the CH2, which is CH2-COOH. So the H on the second CH would be adjacent to the H on the first CH (one H) and the H on the CH2 group (two H's). So the splitting for the second CH's H would be: coupled with the first CH (doublet) and the CH2 (triplet), leading to a triplet of doublets or a doublet of triplets.

Additionally, the H on the CH2 group is attached to the third CH. The CH2 is next to the second CH. So the H's on CH2 would be split by the H's on the adjacent CH (from the second CH). The second CH has one H, so each H on the CH2 would be a doublet, but since there are two H's, they might form a triplet.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about each H in the structure.

In option C, the structure is CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

So, the first CH (CH(CH3)) has only one H, which is attached to a CH3 and to the second CH. The second CH is attached to another CH3 and to the first CH and the third CH (which is CH2). The third CH is CH2, which is attached to the second CH and to COOH.

So, the H on the first CH is adjacent to the H on the second CH. The H on the second CH is adjacent to the H on the first CH and the H on the third CH (the CH2). The H on the CH2 is adjacent to the H on the second CH.

So, for the first CH's H: it's next to the second CH's H. So this would be a doublet.

The second CH's H is next to the first CH's H (one H) and the CH2's H (two H's). So it would split into a triplet (from CH2) and a doublet (from first CH), leading to a triplet of doublets (or doublet of triplets).

The CH2's H's are each next to the second CH's H. Since there are two H's on CH2, each would be a doublet from the second CH's H. But since they are equivalent, the CH2 group would be a triplet? Wait, no. For each H on CH2, it's coupled with the H on the adjacent CH, which has one H. So each H on CH2 would be a doublet. But since the two H's on CH2 are equivalent, the splitting would be a triplet? Or perhaps a quartet? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, considering the CH2 group is between the second CH and the COOH. The two H's on CH2 would each split into doublets due to the adjacent CH's H (which is one H). But since the two H's are equivalent, the CH2 would show as a triplet (n+1 where n=1, so 2 H's would be a triplet) or perhaps a doublet of some sort.

Wait, maybe the CH2 would be a triplet because each H is adjacent to one H on the CH (so n=1, triplet). But since the two H's are equivalent, their combined splitting would be a triplet, so the CH2 would be a triplet.

But in the question, one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets, another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. That seems more complex than what I'm predicting here.

Let me think again. Perhaps I'm missing something. The fact that the NMR shows one signal as a doublet of triplets of quartets and another as a doublet of triplets of triplets suggests that each proton is undergoing splitting from multiple different neighboring groups.

Maybe the structure has a central proton that's adjacent to two different sets of neighboring protons, each of which is further split by their own neighbors.

Looking at option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH.

Structure: CH3CH2-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-COOH.

So the first CH is attached to CH2CH3 and C2H5. The second CH is attached to C2H5 and the first CH.

Wait, no. Let's write it as: CH3CH2-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-COOH. The middle two CH's each have a C2H5 substituent.

So, the first CH (connected to CH2CH3) has one H, and is connected to the second CH (which has another H and a C2H5).

The second CH is connected to the first CH and to the COOH. Each of these CH's H would couple with the adjacent CH's H.

Additionally, the CH(C2H5) groups may have their own coupling.

Wait, perhaps each CH's H is adjacent to the H on the other CH. But each also is attached to a C2H5 group, which is a larger substituent. So, the H on each CH would be next to the H on the other CH, leading to a doublet. But if the CH is also next to other groups, perhaps more splitting occurs.

But I'm not sure. Let's try to think about the NMR for option B.

In option B, the two middle CH's are each attached to a C2H5 group. Each CH's H is adjacent to the H on the other CH. So each would be a doublet. But perhaps the CH's also have coupling with the CH2 group or other substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps each CH's H is adjacent to the CH2 group's H's. The CH2 group (from CH3CH2-) is attached to the first CH. So the H on the first CH would be adjacent to the CH2's H's, which are two in number.

So, the first CH's H would be next to two H's on the CH2 and one H on the adjacent CH. So the splitting would be a triplet (from CH2) and a doublet (from adjacent CH), leading to a triplet of doublets, which is a doublet of triplets.

Similarly, the second CH's H would be adjacent to the first CH's H and perhaps the COOH group. Since COOH is a carbonyl, maybe it's not a source of splitting. So the second CH's H would be a doublet (from first CH) and perhaps no other splitting, but that might not explain the complex pattern.

Hmm, perhaps I'm not on the right track. Let me think about which option would have a proton that's coupled to multiple sets of protons, leading to such complex splitting.

Option D's structure: CH3CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Each middle CH is CH(CH3). So the first CH is connected to CH2CH3 and the second CH. The second CH is connected to the first CH and the COOH.

The H on the first CH would be adjacent to the H on the second CH (one H) and the H's on the CH2CH3 group (two H's). So the splitting for the first CH's H would be a triplet (from CH2CH3) and a doublet (from second CH), leading to a triplet of doublets, or a doublet of triplets.

The H on the second CH would be adjacent to the H on the first CH (one H) and perhaps the H on the COOH's adjacent group. But COOH is at the end, so the second CH's H would only couple with the first CH's H, making it a doublet.

Wait, but the question says that one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets, which is more complex. So perhaps the first CH's H is a doublet of triplets, and the second CH's H is a doublet.

Alternatively, perhaps the splitting is more complex due to coupling with more protons.

Wait, another approach: the NMR signals indicate that one set of protons is a doublet of triplets of quartets. That implies three levels of splitting. So each proton is split by three different sets of neighboring protons.

How can that happen? Let's say a proton is adjacent to three different groups, each with their own number of protons. Or perhaps it's adjacent to one group which itself is adjacent to another group, leading to more couplings.

Alternatively, maybe the proton is on a carbon that's connected to two different sets, each with two protons, and perhaps another set.

Wait, let's think about the structure of option A again: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

So, the two middle CH's are each attached to a C2H5 group and connected to each other. The CH2 group is attached to the end.

The H on each CH would be adjacent to the other CH's H and the CH2's H's.

So, each CH's H is next to one H (from the other CH) and two H's (from the CH2). So the splitting would be a triplet (from CH2) and a doublet (from the other CH), leading to a triplet of doublets, or a doublet of triplets.

But to get a quartet, perhaps each CH's H is also adjacent to another set of protons. Alternatively, maybe the two CH's are each attached to C2H5 groups, which themselves have protons that can couple. But I'm not sure if coupling across multiple bonds is significant in such cases.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 group's H's are split by the adjacent CH's H, leading to a triplet. But in the NMR data, the signals are more complex, so perhaps the situation is more involved.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure has a central carbon with multiple substituents, leading to more coupling.

Wait, looking back at the options, option A is CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

Each of the two middle CH's is attached to a C2H5 group and connected to each other. So each CH's H is adjacent to the other CH's H (one H) and the CH2's H's (two H's).

So the H's on each middle CH would be a triplet (from CH2) and a doublet (from adjacent CH), leading to a triplet of doublets or a doublet of triplets.

But the NMR data mentions one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. That's a higher level of splitting, implying more coupling partners.

Wait, perhaps the CH2 group's H's are themselves split by the adjacent CH. So the CH2 would be a triplet (if adjacent to one H). So each H on CH2 would be a doublet, but since there are two H's, the CH2 would be a triplet.

But in the NMR data, one signal is a quartet, which is n+1 = 4, so n=3. That would mean a proton is adjacent to three equivalent H's. But where would that happen in any of the options?

Looking back, perhaps the correct structure is option A. Let me think again about option A.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

The structure is CH3-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

The two middle CH's are each attached to a C2H5 and connected to each other. The CH2 is attached to the last CH.

So, the H on each middle CH is adjacent to the H on the other CH (one H) and the H's on the CH2 (two H's). So each middle CH's H would be a triplet (from CH2) and a doublet (from the other CH), resulting in a triplet of doublets or a doublet of triplets.

The H's on the CH2 would be adjacent to the H on the last CH (one H). So each H on CH2 would be a doublet, but since there are two H's, the CH2 group would be a triplet.

But the NMR data includes a quartet, which suggests a proton adjacent to three equivalent H's. So where does that come from?

Wait, perhaps the CH2's H's are adjacent to the middle CH's H (one H), making the CH2 a triplet. But that doesn't lead to a quartet.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is next to a CH which is next to another CH, leading to more splitting.

Wait, perhaps in option A, the CH2 is attached to the last CH, which is attached to the middle CH's. So the H on the CH2 would be split by the H on the adjacent CH (one H), making it a doublet. But that would be a triplet for the CH2 because n=1 (two H's would be split into a triplet), but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the splitting for each group in each option. Let's try to outline each:

Option D: Structure is CH3CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

First CH: attached to CH2CH3 and to the next CH. So H on first CH is adjacent to the H on next CH (one H) and the H's on CH2CH3 (two H's). So triplet (from CH2CH3) and doublet (from next CH) → triplet of doublets (or doublet of triplets).

The next CH (second CH): attached to first CH and to COOH. H is adjacent to first CH's H (one H) and perhaps nothing else. So doublet.

The CH2CH3 group: the H's on the CH2 would be adjacent to the first CH's H (one H). So each H on CH2 would be a doublet, but since two H's, the CH2 would be a triplet.

In the NMR, the signals would be:

- CH2CH3: triplet (adjacent to one H)
- first CH: doublet of triplets (from CH2 and next CH)
- second CH: doublet
- COOH: no H adjacent beyond the CH.

But the question says that one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets, which is a more complex pattern, so maybe this isn't the case.

Option C: Structure is CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

First CH: adjacent to CH3 and the second CH. H on first CH is adjacent to the second CH's H (one H) and the CH3's H's, but CH3 is a group with three H's. Wait, but the H on the first CH isn't adjacent to the CH3's H's; it's on a neighboring C. Unless there's coupling through multiple bonds, but that's usually not significant.

So, the H on the first CH is only adjacent to the second CH's H (one H), so a doublet.

The second CH's H is adjacent to the first CH's H (one H) and the CH2's H's (two H's). So it's a triplet (from CH2) and a doublet (from first CH), leading to a triplet of doublets.

The CH2's H's are adjacent to the second CH's H (one H), so each H on CH2 would be a doublet, but since two H's, the CH2 would be a triplet.

So, NMR signals would have:

- first CH: doublet
- second CH: triplet of doublets
- CH2: triplet
- CH3 groups: singlet (if they're equivalent, but in this structure, each CH(CH3) has its own CH3, so perhaps as multiple singlets, but I think the CH3 groups are all equivalent in the structure.

Wait, but the CH3 groups on the first and second CH are attached to different parts of the molecule, so in NMR they might appear as separate singlets or perhaps as a multiplet if there's any coupling.

But the given NMR data doesn't mention any singlets, but rather complex multiplets.

Hmm, perhaps I'm not considering all the possibilities.

Another approach: For a proton to exhibit a quartet, it must be adjacent to a group with three equivalent protons. Where in the options would that happen?

Looking at the options, perhaps in option B, the CH2CH3 groups are attached to the CH's. So the CH2 in CH2CH3 would be adjacent to a CH with one H. So the CH2 would be a triplet (n=1, triplet). But that doesn't produce a quartet.

Wait, unless the CH is adjacent to a CH2, which is adjacent to another CH, leading to more splitting.

Wait, in option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH.

The structure is CH3CH2-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-COOH.

So, the two middle CH's each have a C2H5 substituent.

The CH2CH3 group is attached to the first CH. The CH2's H's are adjacent to the first CH's H (one H), so each H on CH2 would be a doublet, but since there are two H's, the CH2 would be a triplet.

The first CH's H is adjacent to the CH2's H's (two H's) and the second CH's H (one H), so it would be a triplet of doublets (or doublet of triplets).

The second CH's H is adjacent to the first CH's H (one H) and perhaps the COOH, but COOH doesn't contribute H. So the second CH's H would be a doublet.

So, in the NMR, we would see a triplet (from CH2), a doublet of triplets (from first CH), and a doublet (from second CH). But again, the data mentions a quartet, which I'm not seeing here.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's think about option A again.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

Structure: CH3-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

Each middle CH has a C2H5 substituent. The CH2 is attached to the last CH.

The H on each middle CH is adjacent to the other CH's H (one H) and the CH2's H's (two H's), leading to a triplet of doublets.

The CH2's H's are adjacent to the last CH's H (one H), so each H on CH2 would be a doublet, making the CH2 a triplet.

So, the NMR would show:

- CH3: triplet (from adjacent CH)
- CH(C2H5) groups: each H is a triplet of doublets
- CH2: triplet.

Wait, but in the NMR data, one of the signals is a quartet. So this doesn't fit either.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is option A, but I'm not seeing where the quartet would come from.

Wait, perhaps the H on the CH2 is adjacent to the H on the last CH, which is also adjacent to the middle CH's. Let me think.

The last CH (before COOH) is attached to the CH2. Its H is adjacent to the H on the middle CH (one H) and the H on the CH2 (two H's). So the H on the last CH would be a triplet (from CH2) and a doublet (from middle CH), resulting in a triplet of doublets.

Wait, but the CH2's H's are adjacent to the last CH's H (one H), so each H on CH2 would be a doublet, making the CH2 a triplet.

But again, I'm not seeing a quartet.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the number of distinct NMR signals each option would produce.

The question states that several peaks are observed, none of which correspond to vinyl hydrogens. So the NMR might have a few signals, each split into multiple peaks.

Looking back, the given data says that one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is option A. Let me think about the H on the CH2 group.

In option A, the CH2 is attached to the last CH. The H on the last CH is adjacent to the CH2 and the middle CH's. So the H on the last CH would be split by the CH2's H's (two H's → triplet) and the middle CH's H (one H → doublet), leading to a triplet of doublets.

The H's on the CH2 are adjacent to the last CH's H (one H → doublet). So each H on CH2 would be a doublet, but since there are two H's, the CH2 would be a triplet.

Wait, but the question says that one of the signals is a quartet. So where does a quartet come from?

Alternatively, perhaps the H on the middle CH is adjacent to the CH2's H's (two H's → triplet) and also to the other middle CH's H (one H → doublet), making it a triplet of doublets.

But perhaps in option A, the H on the middle CH is also adjacent to the C2H5 group's H's. Wait, but C2H5 is a substituent on the CH, so the H on the CH is attached to C2H5, but would it be adjacent to the H's on the C2H5 group?

Wait, the H on the CH is attached to a C2H5 group, but the C2H5's H's are on a different carbon. Coupling between H's on adjacent carbons (like CH and C2H5) is possible but usually not significant beyond vicinal coupling (J around 6-8 Hz). However, in practice, splitting due to distant H's is often negligible, so I think the H on the CH wouldn't be split by the H's on the C2H5 group.

Therefore, the H on the middle CH in option A would be split only by the adjacent CH's H and the CH2's H's, leading to a triplet of doublets or a doublet of triplets.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not entirely confident about the quartet part. Alternatively, maybe it's option D.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck. Let's try to think of the splitting patterns.

In the question, one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. That's a high level of splitting. For a quartet to be part of the splitting, the proton must be adjacent to a group with three equivalent H's. Where is that possible?

Looking back at the options:

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

The structure is CH3CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

In this structure, the two middle CH's each have a CH3 group. The CH2CH3 group is attached to the first CH.

The H on the first CH is adjacent to the CH2CH3's H's (two H's → triplet) and the next CH's H (one H → doublet), making it a triplet of doublets.

The H on the next CH is adjacent to the first CH's H (one H → doublet) and perhaps nothing else. So a doublet.

The CH2CH3 group's H's are adjacent to the first CH's H (one H → triplet).

The CH3 groups attached to the middle CH's would each be a singlet, as their H's are not adjacent to any other H's.

So in the NMR, the signals would be:

- CH2CH3: triplet (from adjacent CH)
- first CH: triplet of doublets (or doublet of triplets)
- next CH: doublet
- CH3 (on CH(CH3)): singlet
- COOH: no H.

But the question mentions one signal is a quartet, which isn't present here.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's think about the central CH's H.

In option D, the two middle CH's are each attached to a CH3. So their H's would each be adjacent to the other CH's H and the CH2CH3's H's.

Wait, the H on the first CH (attached to CH2CH3) is adjacent to the H on the second CH (one H) and the H's on CH2CH3 (two H's), leading to a triplet of doublets.

The H on the second CH is adjacent to the H on the first CH (one H) and the H on the COOH's adjacent CH. But the COOH is at the end, so I don't think that contributes.

So the H on the second CH would be a doublet. So no quartet here.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not seeing where the quartet comes from. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the CH2 group's H's as a triplet, but the data mentions a quartet.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the H on the middle CH is adjacent to the CH2's H's (two H's) and also the H's on the C2H5 groups. But I don't think that's the case because the C2H5 is a substituent, not adjacent.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the correct structure has a CH2 group that is adjacent to a CH that is itself adjacent to another CH, leading to multiple levels of splitting.

Looking back, perhaps option A has a CH2 group that's adjacent to a CH, which is adjacent to another CH, leading to more splitting.

In option A, the CH2 is attached to the last CH. The last CH is attached to the middle CH's. So the H on the CH2 would be adjacent to the last CH's H (one H → doublet).

Additionally, the H on the last CH is adjacent to the middle CH's H (one H → doublet) and the CH2's H's (two H's → triplet). So the last CH's H would be a triplet of doublets.

But the H on the CH2 would only be a doublet.

So, perhaps the CH2 group's H's would be a doublet, but since there are two H's, the peak would be split into a triplet. Wait, no. Each H on CH2 would be a doublet from the adjacent CH's H, but since they are equivalent, the CH2 would be a triplet.

But the data includes a quartet, which I'm still not seeing.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, despite not seeing the quartet. Or perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, another approach: the FTIR shows a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹, which is a carbonyl. Carboxylic acids typically have a broad peak around 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ due to O-H stretching. The very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ fits this.

So the compound is a carboxylic acid. All options fit this.

Now, looking at the NMR signals: the H's on the CH2 group would typically be a triplet if adjacent to a CH with one H, or a quartet if adjacent to a CH with two H's. Wait, no, if a CH2 is next to a CH with one H, then the CH2's H's would split into a triplet (n=1 → 2 H's → 2+1=3 → triplet). So if the CH2 is next to a CH with one H, it's a triplet.

But the data has a quartet. Wait, a quartet would mean n=3, which would require the CH2 being adjacent to a CH with three H's. But a CH with three H's would be a CH3 group. So if the CH2 is next to a CH3, then it would be a quartet.

Wait, that's a possibility. So where in the options does the CH2 group sit next to a CH3?

Looking at the options:

Option D: CH3CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

The CH2 group is attached to the first CH, which is attached to CH3 (from CH2CH3) and the next CH(CH3). So the CH2 is next to a CH that has a CH3 group.

Wait, the CH2 is attached to the first CH (CH2CH3 is CH2-CH3, so the first CH is part of the CH2CH3 group). So the CH2 in CH2CH3 is attached to the first CH, which is part of the CH(CH3) group. Wait, actually, in option D, the structure is CH3CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So the first CH is part of the CH2CH3 (CH3-CH2-), then attached to the first CH(CH3), then another CH(CH3), then COOH.

Wait, perhaps the CH2 group in CH2CH3 is adjacent to the first CH(CH3), which has a CH3 group. So the CH2's H's would be adjacent to the H on the CH(CH3)'s CH.

Wait, the CH2 group is adjacent to the first CH(CH3)'s CH. So the H's on CH2 would be adjacent to one H (from CH(CH3)), leading to a triplet. But that doesn't explain a quartet.

Wait, but if the CH2 is adjacent to a CH3 group, that would require the CH2 being next to a CH3, which has three H's. But in the options, the CH2 is part of the CH2CH3 group, which is adjacent to a CH that has a CH3 substituent, not the CH2 itself.

Hmm, perhaps I'm confusing the structure. Let me clarify.

In option D, the structure is CH3-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So, the CH2 group is between CH3 and CH(CH3). The CH(CH3) is attached to a CH3 group.

So the CH2's H's are adjacent to the H on the CH(CH3). The CH(CH3) has one H. So the CH2's H's would be a triplet (n=1, two H's → triplet).

But the data has a quartet, which requires n=3.

Wait, perhaps in option A, the CH2 is adjacent to a CH3 group. Let me look.

Option A: CH3-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

The CH2 group is attached to the last CH, which is attached to the middle CH's.

The middle CH's each have a C2H5 group, not a CH3. So the CH2 is not adjacent to a CH3.

Wait, but the middle CH's have C2H5 substituents. So the CH2 is adjacent to a CH that has a C2H5 substituent, which is a larger group but not a CH3.

Hmm, I'm not seeing a situation where the CH2 is adjacent to a CH3 group, which would explain a quartet.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me consider that perhaps the correct answer is option A, and the quartet comes from some other part.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm not seeing where the quartet would come from either.

Wait, let me think of another approach. The number of unique environments in each structure might help.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

The structure has CH3, two CH(C2H5), CH2, and COOH. So perhaps the H's on the two CH(C2H5) groups are equivalent, leading to a singlet for those H's. The CH2 would have a separate signal, as would the CH3 and COOH. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but the data says that none of the signals correspond to vinyl H's, which we've already established isn't the case in any of the options.

Hmm.

In any case, perhaps the best approach is to look for the structure that has a central CH with multiple adjacent groups leading to a complex splitting pattern.

Given the data, I think option A is the most likely. But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, another thought: the question mentions that none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens, which are typically around δ 4-7 as doublets. So if all the structures don't have any vinyl H's, that's fine.

But the splitting patterns suggest that some H's are adjacent to multiple other H's.

In option D, the CH2CH3 group's H's would be a triplet due to the adjacent CH's H. The first CH's H would be a triplet of doublets, and the second CH's H would be a doublet.

But the data includes a quartet, which I can't seem to find. So perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH.

Structure: CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

Each CH in the middle has a CH3. The CH2 is at the end.

The H on each middle CH is adjacent to the other CH's H (one H) and the CH2's H's (two H's). So each middle CH's H would be a triplet (from CH2) and a doublet (from adjacent CH), leading to a triplet of doublets or a doublet of triplets.

The CH2's H's are adjacent to the last CH's H (one H → doublet). So the CH2 would be a triplet.

But again, the quartet isn't explained.

Wait, perhaps the H on the last CH is adjacent to the middle CH's H (one H) and the CH2's H's (two H's), leading to a triplet of doublets. But that doesn't result in a quartet.

I'm really stuck here. Perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe I should go back to the problem statement and look for clues I might have missed.

Wait, the FTIR also shows a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹, which could be a carbonyl. If the compound is a carboxylic acid, that makes sense. No other functional groups would fit that peak as well.

In the NMR, the presence of a quartet suggests a proton adjacent to three equivalent protons. So perhaps the correct structure has a CH2 group adjacent to a CH3 group.

Looking again, option D: CH3CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

The CH2 group is part of CH2CH3, which is attached to the first CH(CH3). So the CH2 is adjacent to the first CH, which has a CH3 substituent. But the CH2's H's are adjacent to one H (from the CH). So the CH2's H's would be a triplet, not a quartet.

Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the H's on the middle CH's are each adjacent to two different CH groups, leading to more splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, and the quartet comes from the CH2 group when considering coupling with the adjacent CH's H and any other groups.

I think I'm going to have to make an educated guess here. Based on the splitting patterns, the most likely structure is option A, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, option C or D might fit better.

Wait, another approach: the number of neighboring H's for each proton.

The signal that is a doublet of triplets of quartets would have undergone three levels of splitting.

So, the first split is into a doublet (coupled with one H), then each of those splits into triplets (coupled with two H's), then each of those splits into quartets (coupled with three H's). So the proton must be adjacent to a group with three H's, which is a CH3.

Therefore, the correct structure must have a CH that's adjacent to a CH3 group, making the adjacent CH's H's split the proton's signal.

Looking at the options, which structure has a CH adjacent to a CH3?

Option D: CH3CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

In this case, the first CH is part of CH2CH3, which is attached to the first CH(CH3). So the CH2CH3's CH is adjacent to the CH(CH3)'s CH. The CH(CH3) has a CH3 substituent. So the first CH's H is adjacent to the CH(CH3)'s H, which is adjacent to a CH3.

Wait, perhaps the H on the first CH (part of CH2CH3) is adjacent to the H on the CH(CH3), which is adjacent to the CH3. So the H on the first CH would couple with the H on CH(CH3), which in turn couples with the CH3's H's. But coupling through two bonds is usually small and may not be significant enough to cause observable splitting in the NMR. So perhaps this doesn't account for the quartet.

Alternatively, perhaps the H on the CH(CH3) is adjacent to the CH3 group's H's, leading to a quartet, but that would require the H on CH(CH3) to be adjacent to three H's, which is possible.

Wait, in option D, the H on the CH(CH3) is adjacent to a CH3 group. So the H on CH(CH3) would be adjacent to three H's (from the CH3), leading to a quartet (n=3 → 4 peaks). But wait, the H on CH(CH3) is attached to the CH3, so it's adjacent to the CH3's H's. But coupling between H's on adjacent carbons (like CH(CH3) and CH3) is possible, but typically, such coupling is small and may not lead to significant splitting. However, if it does, the H on CH(CH3) would split into a quartet.

But in the NMR data, one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets, which would imply the proton is coupled with three different groups: one with one H, another with two H's, and another with three H's. That seems very complex, but perhaps it's possible.

So, the H on the CH(CH3) in option D would be adjacent to:

- The H on the previous CH (one H → doublet)
- The H on the adjacent CH (one H → doublet)
- The H's on the CH3 group (three H's → quartet)

Wait, but the H on CH(CH3) is adjacent to the CH3's H's, but that would require coupling through three bonds (C-C-C), which is possible but usually not strong enough to cause a quartet. However, in some cases, like in CH(CH3) groups, coupling can be observed.

So, the H on CH(CH3) would be split into a quartet (from CH3's three H's), a doublet (from adjacent CH's H), and a doublet (from previous CH's H). But that would result in a quartet of doublets of doublets, which is a very complex pattern.

In the given data, one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets, which is a different order. So perhaps this is the case in option D.

Therefore, perhaps option D is the correct answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying a compound based on FTIR and ¹H NMR data. The FTIR spectrum shows a broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹, indicative of an O-H stretch (likely from a carboxylic acid), and a strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carbonyl group. The ¹H NMR spectrum reveals complex splitting patterns: one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. None of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens, ruling out any double bonds.

**Answer: D**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, I need to figure out which compound is the correct one based on the given spectroscopic data. Let's go through the problem step by step.

First, the FTIR data: a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in FTIR usually indicate O-H (alcohol or carboxylic acid) or N-H (amines) stretches. But since there's also a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹, which is around the region for carbonyl groups (C=O). So 1700 is more likely a carbonyl, maybe a ketone or an ester or a carboxylic acid. Wait, but carboxylic acids have O-H stretches which are usually very broad. Oh, right, the broad peak at 3000 must be from the O-H of a carboxylic acid. So the compound has a carboxylic acid group.

Next, the 1H NMR data: several peaks, none corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. So no double bonds with adjacent hydrogens. So the compound is either a branched or straight-chain structure without any conjugated double bonds.

Looking at the options, all of them have a COOH group. So that fits.

Now, looking at the NMR signals: one is a doublet of triplets of quartets, another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm. That suggests complex splitting patterns, which usually happen when the proton is next to multiple sets of neighboring protons. So maybe the structure has a central carbon connected to multiple different groups, leading to each neighboring set splitting into more peaks.

Looking at the structures of the options:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
So the structure is like this: CH2COOH is at the end, then a CH connected to two C2H5 groups, then another CH connected to two C2H5 groups, and the central CH connected to two CH3? Wait, no. Let me write it out:

Option A: The main chain is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. Wait, the carbon chain would be like: CH3 attached to a CH that's attached to a C2H5 group, then another CH attached to another C2H5, then CH2COOH. So perhaps the structure is CH3-C(CH2CH3)(H)-C(CH2CH3)(H)-CH2COOH.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me look again:

Option A: CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH. So each of the middle carbons (the two CH groups) is attached to a CH3 and a C2H5 group? Or wait, no. The formula is CH3 C(H)(C2H5) C(H)(C2H5) CH2 COOH. So the two middle carbons each have a CH group, each connected to a C2H5. So each of those CH groups is attached to another CH group, but perhaps that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the structure is something like:

CH3-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

Wait, but each of the middle carbons has a CH group, each attached to a C2H5. So each of those CH groups is attached to one C2H5 and one CH2CH3 group? Hmm, perhaps it's better to draw it.

Alternatively, looking at option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

So the structure would be CH2CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So each of the two middle carbons is attached to a CH3 and the other is a CH group. So maybe those middle carbons each have two CH3 groups attached?

Wait, perhaps it's more like:

Option D: The main chain is CH3CH2-C-(H)(CH3)-C-(H)(CH3)-COOH. So the two middle carbons (each attached to H and CH3) are connected in a way that each is adjacent to each other. So perhaps it's a geminal structure with two CH3 groups on each of the two central carbons.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH3CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Wait, but that would make the two middle carbons each attached to a CH3 and the next carbon. But in option D, it's written as CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH, which implies that each of the two middle carbons has a CH group, each with a CH3 substituent. So each CH is connected to a CH3. So the structure would be something like:

CH3CH2-C(CH3)(H)-C(CH3)(H)-COOH.

Wait, but that would mean each of the two middle carbons is CH attached to a CH3. So each of those CH groups is connected to another CH group. Hmm, maybe it's more like a central chain with branching on each of the two middle carbons.

Alternatively, let's think about the NMR signals. One signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. That seems like a very complex splitting, implying each proton is next to multiple sets of neighboring protons, perhaps each with different coupling constants.

Looking for structures where a proton is adjacent to multiple different types of neighboring protons.

For example, if a proton is on a carbon that's connected to two different types of adjacent carbons, each with their own sets of neighboring protons, that could lead to such complex splitting.

Another approach: let's think about each option's structure and predict what the NMR would look like.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

So the structure is:

CH3-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

In this structure, the CH groups are each attached to a C2H5 group and connected to each other. The CH2 group is next to a CH that is attached to C2H5. So the middle CH's have adjacent CH groups.

Wait, maybe the middle CH's are each attached to other CH's, leading to coupling with their neighboring protons.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH.

Which would be:

CH3CH2-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-COOH.

In this case, the two middle CH's are each attached to a C2H5 and connected to each other. The CH2 group is attached to the first CH, and the COOH is attached to the last CH.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH.

Structure:

CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

So each middle CH is attached to a CH3 and connected to another CH which is also attached to a CH3. The CH2 is attached to the last CH.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

Structure:

CH3CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So the middle CH's are each attached to a CH3 and connected to each other. The CH2 is attached to the first CH, and the COOH is attached to the last CH.

Now, looking at the NMR signals. Let's think about each option's possible NMR.

The question says that the NMR has several peaks, but none are vinyl (so no double bonds). So all structures are aliphatic.

In the NMR, one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. Another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. These are complex multiplets, meaning each proton is split by multiple neighboring sets.

Let's think about each structure:

Option A: The middle CH groups are each attached to a C2H5. The CH2 is attached to the last CH. Let's imagine the CH2 group would be a triplet (if next to a CH with two protons?), but wait, the CH2 is attached to a CH which has one proton, right? Wait, the last CH in the chain (before COOH) is a CH connected to another CH and the CH2. So the CH2 would be a triplet if it's next to a CH with two protons. Hmm, but each CH in the middle has how many neighboring Hs? Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the central CH groups (e.g., the two middle CH's) would have more complex splitting because each is next to two different types of protons.

Option D: The structure is CH3CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the middle CH groups has a CH3 attached and is connected to the other CH group.

In this case, the protons on the CH(CH3) groups would each be adjacent to two sets of protons. Let's see:

The first CH(CH3) is connected to CH2CH3 and to the next CH(CH3). So the proton on the first CH(CH3) would couple with the protons on the adjacent CH2 group (CH2CH3) and with the protons on the next CH(CH3). Wait, but the next CH(CH3) has only one proton, so maybe each coupling is with one proton.

Wait, perhaps each CH(CH3) has one proton adjacent to the CH2 group and one adjacent to the other CH(CH3) group. So the coupling would be with two different sets of protons.

Let me try to draw their positions.

In Option D, the structure is:

CH3CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So, the two middle carbons each have a CH group with a methyl attached.

The first CH is attached to CH2CH3, the next CH is attached to COOH. Each of their CH's has a methyl group.

So, the protons on the first CH would be adjacent to the CH2 group (which has two protons) and the next CH (which has one proton). So each of these protons would split into a doublet from the adjacent CH (one proton) and a triplet from the CH2 (two protons).

Wait, but that's two different coupling constants. So the splitting would be a triplet of doublets, or a doublet of triplets. Hmm.

Wait, for each proton, the coupling would be with the adjacent CH2 (two H's) and the adjacent CH (one H). So each proton would have two sets of coupling: with two H's (which would split it into triplet) and with one H (which would split it into doublet). So the overall splitting would be a triplet of doublets (or doublet of triplets, depending on which is first). Similarly, the next CH would have coupling with the previous CH (one H) and perhaps another group.

Wait, but in Option D, the two middle CH groups are each attached to a CH3, and connected to each other. So the first CH is attached to CH2CH3 and to the next CH, and the next CH is attached to the previous CH and to COOH.

So the first CH's proton would be next to the CH2 (two H's) and the next CH (one H). So the splitting would be a triplet (from CH2) and a doublet (from CH), leading to a triplet of doublets. Similarly, the next CH's proton would be next to the first CH (one H) and perhaps the COOH's adjacent CH2 (but perhaps not, because COOH is at the end as -COOH, which is a carbonyl group attached to an OH and an O-H. So the adjacent to the last CH is COOH, which is a carbonyl. So maybe the last CH doesn't have any adjacent H's beyond the CH itself.

Wait, no. The last CH in option D is attached to COOH. So the CH next to COOH would be CH(CH3). Its H would be adjacent to the previous CH's H, and perhaps not any others beyond.

So the first and second CH's H would each have different coupling.

Alternatively, perhaps the first CH's H is split by the CH2 group (two H's) and the next CH (one H), leading to a triplet of doublets. So the signal would be a doublet of triplets, or a triplet of doublets, which is similar to the given data.

Wait, but the given data shows one signal as a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another as a doublet of triplets of triplets. That's a lot more splitting, implying more coupling partners.

Let's think about option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH. So structure is CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

Each CH in the middle is attached to a CH3. So the two middle CH's are each attached to a CH3 and connected to each other. The last CH2 is attached to the COOH.

In this case, the middle CH's H would be adjacent to the previous CH (one H) and the next CH (one H), and perhaps the CH2 group (two H's) for the last CH.

Wait, let's think about the first CH(CH3): it is attached to CH3, next to the previous CH3 (from CH3CH(CH3)-), and connected to another CH(CH3). So the H on the first CH might be next to the H on the second CH and the H on the CH2 (if any).

Wait, not exactly. The structure is CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

So, the first CH is attached to CH3 and to the second CH. The second CH is attached to another CH3 and to the first CH and the third CH (which is the CH2). Wait, no: the structure is CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH. So the first CH is attached to CH3 and to the second CH. The second CH is attached to CH3 and to the first CH and to the third CH. The third CH is attached to CH2 and the second CH.

Wait, the third CH is CH2, but that's not right. Wait, the structure is CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH.

So, the structure is:

CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

So, the first CH is attached to CH3, the second CH is attached to CH3, and the chain continues.

Now, the H on the first CH is adjacent to the H on the second CH. The H on the second CH is adjacent to the H on the first CH and the H on the third CH (which is part of the CH2 group).

Wait, the third CH is the CH2, which is CH2-COOH. So the H on the second CH would be adjacent to the H on the first CH (one H) and the H on the CH2 group (two H's). So the splitting for the second CH's H would be: coupled with the first CH (doublet) and the CH2 (triplet), leading to a triplet of doublets or a doublet of triplets.

Additionally, the H on the CH2 group is attached to the third CH. The CH2 is next to the second CH. So the H's on CH2 would be split by the H's on the adjacent CH (from the second CH). The second CH has one H, so each H on the CH2 would be a doublet, but since there are two H's, they might form a triplet.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about each H in the structure.

In option C, the structure is CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

So, the first CH (CH(CH3)) has only one H, which is attached to a CH3 and to the second CH. The second CH is attached to another CH3 and to the first CH and the third CH (which is CH2). The third CH is CH2, which is attached to the second CH and to COOH.

So, the H on the first CH is adjacent to the H on the second CH. The H on the second CH is adjacent to the H on the first CH and the H on the third CH (the CH2). The H on the CH2 is adjacent to the H on the second CH.

So, for the first CH's H: it's next to the second CH's H. So this would be a doublet.

The second CH's H is next to the first CH's H (one H) and the CH2's H (two H's). So it would split into a triplet (from CH2) and a doublet (from first CH), leading to a triplet of doublets (or doublet of triplets).

The CH2's H's are each next to the second CH's H. Since there are two H's on CH2, each would be a doublet from the second CH's H. But since they are equivalent, the CH2 group would be a triplet? Wait, no. For each H on CH2, it's coupled with the H on the adjacent CH, which has one H. So each H on CH2 would be a doublet. But since the two H's on CH2 are equivalent, the splitting would be a triplet? Or perhaps a quartet? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, considering the CH2 group is between the second CH and the COOH. The two H's on CH2 would each split into doublets due to the adjacent CH's H (which is one H). But since the two H's are equivalent, the CH2 would show as a triplet (n+1 where n=1, so 2 H's would be a triplet) or perhaps a doublet of some sort.

Wait, maybe the CH2 would be a triplet because each H is adjacent to one H on the CH (so n=1, triplet). But since the two H's are equivalent, their combined splitting would be a triplet, so the CH2 would be a triplet.

But in the question, one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets, another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. That seems more complex than what I'm predicting here.

Let me think again. Perhaps I'm missing something. The fact that the NMR shows one signal as a doublet of triplets of quartets and another as a doublet of triplets of triplets suggests that each proton is undergoing splitting from multiple different neighboring groups.

Maybe the structure has a central proton that's adjacent to two different sets of neighboring protons, each of which is further split by their own neighbors.

Looking at option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH.

Structure: CH3CH2-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-COOH.

So the first CH is attached to CH2CH3 and C2H5. The second CH is attached to C2H5 and the first CH.

Wait, no. Let's write it as: CH3CH2-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-COOH. The middle two CH's each have a C2H5 substituent.

So, the first CH (connected to CH2CH3) has one H, and is connected to the second CH (which has another H and a C2H5).

The second CH is connected to the first CH and to the COOH. Each of these CH's H would couple with the adjacent CH's H.

Additionally, the CH(C2H5) groups may have their own coupling.

Wait, perhaps each CH's H is adjacent to the H on the other CH. But each also is attached to a C2H5 group, which is a larger substituent. So, the H on each CH would be next to the H on the other CH, leading to a doublet. But if the CH is also next to other groups, perhaps more splitting occurs.

But I'm not sure. Let's try to think about the NMR for option B.

In option B, the two middle CH's are each attached to a C2H5 group. Each CH's H is adjacent to the H on the other CH. So each would be a doublet. But perhaps the CH's also have coupling with the CH2 group or other substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps each CH's H is adjacent to the CH2 group's H's. The CH2 group (from CH3CH2-) is attached to the first CH. So the H on the first CH would be adjacent to the CH2's H's, which are two in number.

So, the first CH's H would be next to two H's on the CH2 and one H on the adjacent CH. So the splitting would be a triplet (from CH2) and a doublet (from adjacent CH), leading to a triplet of doublets, which is a doublet of triplets.

Similarly, the second CH's H would be adjacent to the first CH's H and perhaps the COOH group. Since COOH is a carbonyl, maybe it's not a source of splitting. So the second CH's H would be a doublet (from first CH) and perhaps no other splitting, but that might not explain the complex pattern.

Hmm, perhaps I'm not on the right track. Let me think about which option would have a proton that's coupled to multiple sets of protons, leading to such complex splitting.

Option D's structure: CH3CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Each middle CH is CH(CH3). So the first CH is connected to CH2CH3 and the second CH. The second CH is connected to the first CH and the COOH.

The H on the first CH would be adjacent to the H on the second CH (one H) and the H's on the CH2CH3 group (two H's). So the splitting for the first CH's H would be a triplet (from CH2CH3) and a doublet (from second CH), leading to a triplet of doublets, or a doublet of triplets.

The H on the second CH would be adjacent to the H on the first CH (one H) and perhaps the H on the COOH's adjacent group. But COOH is at the end, so the second CH's H would only couple with the first CH's H, making it a doublet.

Wait, but the question says that one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets, which is more complex. So perhaps the first CH's H is a doublet of triplets, and the second CH's H is a doublet.

Alternatively, perhaps the splitting is more complex due to coupling with more protons.

Wait, another approach: the NMR signals indicate that one set of protons is a doublet of triplets of quartets. That implies three levels of splitting. So each proton is split by three different sets of neighboring protons.

How can that happen? Let's say a proton is adjacent to three different groups, each with their own number of protons. Or perhaps it's adjacent to one group which itself is adjacent to another group, leading to more couplings.

Alternatively, maybe the proton is on a carbon that's connected to two different sets, each with two protons, and perhaps another set.

Wait, let's think about the structure of option A again: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

So, the two middle CH's are each attached to a C2H5 group and connected to each other. The CH2 group is attached to the end.

The H on each CH would be adjacent to the other CH's H and the CH2's H's.

So, each CH's H is next to one H (from the other CH) and two H's (from the CH2). So the splitting would be a triplet (from CH2) and a doublet (from the other CH), leading to a triplet of doublets, or a doublet of triplets.

But to get a quartet, perhaps each CH's H is also adjacent to another set of protons. Alternatively, maybe the two CH's are each attached to C2H5 groups, which themselves have protons that can couple. But I'm not sure if coupling across multiple bonds is significant in such cases.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 group's H's are split by the adjacent CH's H, leading to a triplet. But in the NMR data, the signals are more complex, so perhaps the situation is more involved.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure has a central carbon with multiple substituents, leading to more coupling.

Wait, looking back at the options, option A is CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

Each of the two middle CH's is attached to a C2H5 group and connected to each other. So each CH's H is adjacent to the other CH's H (one H) and the CH2's H's (two H's).

So the H's on each middle CH would be a triplet (from CH2) and a doublet (from adjacent CH), leading to a triplet of doublets or a doublet of triplets.

But the NMR data mentions one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. That's a higher level of splitting, implying more coupling partners.

Wait, perhaps the CH2 group's H's are themselves split by the adjacent CH. So the CH2 would be a triplet (if adjacent to one H). So each H on CH2 would be a doublet, but since there are two H's, the CH2 would be a triplet.

But in the NMR data, one signal is a quartet, which is n+1 = 4, so n=3. That would mean a proton is adjacent to three equivalent H's. But where would that happen in any of the options?

Looking back, perhaps the correct structure is option A. Let me think again about option A.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

The structure is CH3-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

The two middle CH's are each attached to a C2H5 and connected to each other. The CH2 is attached to the last CH.

So, the H on each middle CH is adjacent to the H on the other CH (one H) and the H's on the CH2 (two H's). So each middle CH's H would be a triplet (from CH2) and a doublet (from the other CH), resulting in a triplet of doublets or a doublet of triplets.

The H's on the CH2 would be adjacent to the H on the last CH (one H). So each H on CH2 would be a doublet, but since there are two H's, the CH2 group would be a triplet.

But the NMR data includes a quartet, which suggests a proton adjacent to three equivalent H's. So where does that come from?

Wait, perhaps the CH2's H's are adjacent to the middle CH's H (one H), making the CH2 a triplet. But that doesn't lead to a quartet.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is next to a CH which is next to another CH, leading to more splitting.

Wait, perhaps in option A, the CH2 is attached to the last CH, which is attached to the middle CH's. So the H on the CH2 would be split by the H on the adjacent CH (one H), making it a doublet. But that would be a triplet for the CH2 because n=1 (two H's would be split into a triplet), but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the splitting for each group in each option. Let's try to outline each:

Option D: Structure is CH3CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

First CH: attached to CH2CH3 and to the next CH. So H on first CH is adjacent to the H on next CH (one H) and the H's on CH2CH3 (two H's). So triplet (from CH2CH3) and doublet (from next CH) → triplet of doublets (or doublet of triplets).

The next CH (second CH): attached to first CH and to COOH. H is adjacent to first CH's H (one H) and perhaps nothing else. So doublet.

The CH2CH3 group: the H's on the CH2 would be adjacent to the first CH's H (one H). So each H on CH2 would be a doublet, but since two H's, the CH2 would be a triplet.

In the NMR, the signals would be:

- CH2CH3: triplet (adjacent to one H)
- first CH: doublet of triplets (from CH2 and next CH)
- second CH: doublet
- COOH: no H adjacent beyond the CH.

But the question says that one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets, which is a more complex pattern, so maybe this isn't the case.

Option C: Structure is CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

First CH: adjacent to CH3 and the second CH. H on first CH is adjacent to the second CH's H (one H) and the CH3's H's, but CH3 is a group with three H's. Wait, but the H on the first CH isn't adjacent to the CH3's H's; it's on a neighboring C. Unless there's coupling through multiple bonds, but that's usually not significant.

So, the H on the first CH is only adjacent to the second CH's H (one H), so a doublet.

The second CH's H is adjacent to the first CH's H (one H) and the CH2's H's (two H's). So it's a triplet (from CH2) and a doublet (from first CH), leading to a triplet of doublets.

The CH2's H's are adjacent to the second CH's H (one H), so each H on CH2 would be a doublet, but since two H's, the CH2 would be a triplet.

So, NMR signals would have:

- first CH: doublet
- second CH: triplet of doublets
- CH2: triplet
- CH3 groups: singlet (if they're equivalent, but in this structure, each CH(CH3) has its own CH3, so perhaps as multiple singlets, but I think the CH3 groups are all equivalent in the structure.

Wait, but the CH3 groups on the first and second CH are attached to different parts of the molecule, so in NMR they might appear as separate singlets or perhaps as a multiplet if there's any coupling.

But the given NMR data doesn't mention any singlets, but rather complex multiplets.

Hmm, perhaps I'm not considering all the possibilities.

Another approach: For a proton to exhibit a quartet, it must be adjacent to a group with three equivalent protons. Where in the options would that happen?

Looking at the options, perhaps in option B, the CH2CH3 groups are attached to the CH's. So the CH2 in CH2CH3 would be adjacent to a CH with one H. So the CH2 would be a triplet (n=1, triplet). But that doesn't produce a quartet.

Wait, unless the CH is adjacent to a CH2, which is adjacent to another CH, leading to more splitting.

Wait, in option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH.

The structure is CH3CH2-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-COOH.

So, the two middle CH's each have a C2H5 substituent.

The CH2CH3 group is attached to the first CH. The CH2's H's are adjacent to the first CH's H (one H), so each H on CH2 would be a doublet, but since there are two H's, the CH2 would be a triplet.

The first CH's H is adjacent to the CH2's H's (two H's) and the second CH's H (one H), so it would be a triplet of doublets (or doublet of triplets).

The second CH's H is adjacent to the first CH's H (one H) and perhaps the COOH, but COOH doesn't contribute H. So the second CH's H would be a doublet.

So, in the NMR, we would see a triplet (from CH2), a doublet of triplets (from first CH), and a doublet (from second CH). But again, the data mentions a quartet, which I'm not seeing here.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's think about option A again.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

Structure: CH3-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

Each middle CH has a C2H5 substituent. The CH2 is attached to the last CH.

The H on each middle CH is adjacent to the other CH's H (one H) and the CH2's H's (two H's), leading to a triplet of doublets.

The CH2's H's are adjacent to the last CH's H (one H), so each H on CH2 would be a doublet, making the CH2 a triplet.

So, the NMR would show:

- CH3: triplet (from adjacent CH)
- CH(C2H5) groups: each H is a triplet of doublets
- CH2: triplet.

Wait, but in the NMR data, one of the signals is a quartet. So this doesn't fit either.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is option A, but I'm not seeing where the quartet would come from.

Wait, perhaps the H on the CH2 is adjacent to the H on the last CH, which is also adjacent to the middle CH's. Let me think.

The last CH (before COOH) is attached to the CH2. Its H is adjacent to the H on the middle CH (one H) and the H on the CH2 (two H's). So the H on the last CH would be a triplet (from CH2) and a doublet (from middle CH), resulting in a triplet of doublets.

Wait, but the CH2's H's are adjacent to the last CH's H (one H), so each H on CH2 would be a doublet, making the CH2 a triplet.

But again, I'm not seeing a quartet.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the number of distinct NMR signals each option would produce.

The question states that several peaks are observed, none of which correspond to vinyl hydrogens. So the NMR might have a few signals, each split into multiple peaks.

Looking back, the given data says that one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is option A. Let me think about the H on the CH2 group.

In option A, the CH2 is attached to the last CH. The H on the last CH is adjacent to the CH2 and the middle CH's. So the H on the last CH would be split by the CH2's H's (two H's → triplet) and the middle CH's H (one H → doublet), leading to a triplet of doublets.

The H's on the CH2 are adjacent to the last CH's H (one H → doublet). So each H on CH2 would be a doublet, but since there are two H's, the CH2 would be a triplet.

Wait, but the question says that one of the signals is a quartet. So where does a quartet come from?

Alternatively, perhaps the H on the middle CH is adjacent to the CH2's H's (two H's → triplet) and also to the other middle CH's H (one H → doublet), making it a triplet of doublets.

But perhaps in option A, the H on the middle CH is also adjacent to the C2H5 group's H's. Wait, but C2H5 is a substituent on the CH, so the H on the CH is attached to C2H5, but would it be adjacent to the H's on the C2H5 group?

Wait, the H on the CH is attached to a C2H5 group, but the C2H5's H's are on a different carbon. Coupling between H's on adjacent carbons (like CH and C2H5) is possible but usually not significant beyond vicinal coupling (J around 6-8 Hz). However, in practice, splitting due to distant H's is often negligible, so I think the H on the CH wouldn't be split by the H's on the C2H5 group.

Therefore, the H on the middle CH in option A would be split only by the adjacent CH's H and the CH2's H's, leading to a triplet of doublets or a doublet of triplets.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not entirely confident about the quartet part. Alternatively, maybe it's option D.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck. Let's try to think of the splitting patterns.

In the question, one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. That's a high level of splitting. For a quartet to be part of the splitting, the proton must be adjacent to a group with three equivalent H's. Where is that possible?

Looking back at the options:

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

The structure is CH3CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

In this structure, the two middle CH's each have a CH3 group. The CH2CH3 group is attached to the first CH.

The H on the first CH is adjacent to the CH2CH3's H's (two H's → triplet) and the next CH's H (one H → doublet), making it a triplet of doublets.

The H on the next CH is adjacent to the first CH's H (one H → doublet) and perhaps nothing else. So a doublet.

The CH2CH3 group's H's are adjacent to the first CH's H (one H → triplet).

The CH3 groups attached to the middle CH's would each be a singlet, as their H's are not adjacent to any other H's.

So in the NMR, the signals would be:

- CH2CH3: triplet (from adjacent CH)
- first CH: triplet of doublets (or doublet of triplets)
- next CH: doublet
- CH3 (on CH(CH3)): singlet
- COOH: no H.

But the question mentions one signal is a quartet, which isn't present here.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's think about the central CH's H.

In option D, the two middle CH's are each attached to a CH3. So their H's would each be adjacent to the other CH's H and the CH2CH3's H's.

Wait, the H on the first CH (attached to CH2CH3) is adjacent to the H on the second CH (one H) and the H's on CH2CH3 (two H's), leading to a triplet of doublets.

The H on the second CH is adjacent to the H on the first CH (one H) and the H on the COOH's adjacent CH. But the COOH is at the end, so I don't think that contributes.

So the H on the second CH would be a doublet. So no quartet here.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not seeing where the quartet comes from. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the CH2 group's H's as a triplet, but the data mentions a quartet.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the H on the middle CH is adjacent to the CH2's H's (two H's) and also the H's on the C2H5 groups. But I don't think that's the case because the C2H5 is a substituent, not adjacent.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the correct structure has a CH2 group that is adjacent to a CH that is itself adjacent to another CH, leading to multiple levels of splitting.

Looking back, perhaps option A has a CH2 group that's adjacent to a CH, which is adjacent to another CH, leading to more splitting.

In option A, the CH2 is attached to the last CH. The last CH is attached to the middle CH's. So the H on the CH2 would be adjacent to the last CH's H (one H → doublet).

Additionally, the H on the last CH is adjacent to the middle CH's H (one H → doublet) and the CH2's H's (two H's → triplet). So the last CH's H would be a triplet of doublets.

But the H on the CH2 would only be a doublet.

So, perhaps the CH2 group's H's would be a doublet, but since there are two H's, the peak would be split into a triplet. Wait, no. Each H on CH2 would be a doublet from the adjacent CH's H, but since they are equivalent, the CH2 would be a triplet.

But the data includes a quartet, which I'm still not seeing.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, despite not seeing the quartet. Or perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, another approach: the FTIR shows a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹, which is a carbonyl. Carboxylic acids typically have a broad peak around 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ due to O-H stretching. The very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ fits this.

So the compound is a carboxylic acid. All options fit this.

Now, looking at the NMR signals: the H's on the CH2 group would typically be a triplet if adjacent to a CH with one H, or a quartet if adjacent to a CH with two H's. Wait, no, if a CH2 is next to a CH with one H, then the CH2's H's would split into a triplet (n=1 → 2 H's → 2+1=3 → triplet). So if the CH2 is next to a CH with one H, it's a triplet.

But the data has a quartet. Wait, a quartet would mean n=3, which would require the CH2 being adjacent to a CH with three H's. But a CH with three H's would be a CH3 group. So if the CH2 is next to a CH3, then it would be a quartet.

Wait, that's a possibility. So where in the options does the CH2 group sit next to a CH3?

Looking at the options:

Option D: CH3CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

The CH2 group is attached to the first CH, which is attached to CH3 (from CH2CH3) and the next CH(CH3). So the CH2 is next to a CH that has a CH3 group.

Wait, the CH2 is attached to the first CH (CH2CH3 is CH2-CH3, so the first CH is part of the CH2CH3 group). So the CH2 in CH2CH3 is attached to the first CH, which is part of the CH(CH3) group. Wait, actually, in option D, the structure is CH3CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So the first CH is part of the CH2CH3 (CH3-CH2-), then attached to the first CH(CH3), then another CH(CH3), then COOH.

Wait, perhaps the CH2 group in CH2CH3 is adjacent to the first CH(CH3), which has a CH3 group. So the CH2's H's would be adjacent to the H on the CH(CH3)'s CH.

Wait, the CH2 group is adjacent to the first CH(CH3)'s CH. So the H's on CH2 would be adjacent to one H (from CH(CH3)), leading to a triplet. But that doesn't explain a quartet.

Wait, but if the CH2 is adjacent to a CH3 group, that would require the CH2 being next to a CH3, which has three H's. But in the options, the CH2 is part of the CH2CH3 group, which is adjacent to a CH that has a CH3 substituent, not the CH2 itself.

Hmm, perhaps I'm confusing the structure. Let me clarify.

In option D, the structure is CH3-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So, the CH2 group is between CH3 and CH(CH3). The CH(CH3) is attached to a CH3 group.

So the CH2's H's are adjacent to the H on the CH(CH3). The CH(CH3) has one H. So the CH2's H's would be a triplet (n=1, two H's → triplet).

But the data has a quartet, which requires n=3.

Wait, perhaps in option A, the CH2 is adjacent to a CH3 group. Let me look.

Option A: CH3-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

The CH2 group is attached to the last CH, which is attached to the middle CH's.

The middle CH's each have a C2H5 group, not a CH3. So the CH2 is not adjacent to a CH3.

Wait, but the middle CH's have C2H5 substituents. So the CH2 is adjacent to a CH that has a C2H5 substituent, which is a larger group but not a CH3.

Hmm, I'm not seeing a situation where the CH2 is adjacent to a CH3 group, which would explain a quartet.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me consider that perhaps the correct answer is option A, and the quartet comes from some other part.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm not seeing where the quartet would come from either.

Wait, let me think of another approach. The number of unique environments in each structure might help.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

The structure has CH3, two CH(C2H5), CH2, and COOH. So perhaps the H's on the two CH(C2H5) groups are equivalent, leading to a singlet for those H's. The CH2 would have a separate signal, as would the CH3 and COOH. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but the data says that none of the signals correspond to vinyl H's, which we've already established isn't the case in any of the options.

Hmm.

In any case, perhaps the best approach is to look for the structure that has a central CH with multiple adjacent groups leading to a complex splitting pattern.

Given the data, I think option A is the most likely. But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, another thought: the question mentions that none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens, which are typically around δ 4-7 as doublets. So if all the structures don't have any vinyl H's, that's fine.

But the splitting patterns suggest that some H's are adjacent to multiple other H's.

In option D, the CH2CH3 group's H's would be a triplet due to the adjacent CH's H. The first CH's H would be a triplet of doublets, and the second CH's H would be a doublet.

But the data includes a quartet, which I can't seem to find. So perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH.

Structure: CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

Each CH in the middle has a CH3. The CH2 is at the end.

The H on each middle CH is adjacent to the other CH's H (one H) and the CH2's H's (two H's). So each middle CH's H would be a triplet (from CH2) and a doublet (from adjacent CH), leading to a triplet of doublets or a doublet of triplets.

The CH2's H's are adjacent to the last CH's H (one H → doublet). So the CH2 would be a triplet.

But again, the quartet isn't explained.

Wait, perhaps the H on the last CH is adjacent to the middle CH's H (one H) and the CH2's H's (two H's), leading to a triplet of doublets. But that doesn't result in a quartet.

I'm really stuck here. Perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe I should go back to the problem statement and look for clues I might have missed.

Wait, the FTIR also shows a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹, which could be a carbonyl. If the compound is a carboxylic acid, that makes sense. No other functional groups would fit that peak as well.

In the NMR, the presence of a quartet suggests a proton adjacent to three equivalent protons. So perhaps the correct structure has a CH2 group adjacent to a CH3 group.

Looking again, option D: CH3CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

The CH2 group is part of CH2CH3, which is attached to the first CH(CH3). So the CH2 is adjacent to the first CH, which has a CH3 substituent. But the CH2's H's are adjacent to one H (from the CH). So the CH2's H's would be a triplet, not a quartet.

Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the H's on the middle CH's are each adjacent to two different CH groups, leading to more splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, and the quartet comes from the CH2 group when considering coupling with the adjacent CH's H and any other groups.

I think I'm going to have to make an educated guess here. Based on the splitting patterns, the most likely structure is option A, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, option C or D might fit better.

Wait, another approach: the number of neighboring H's for each proton.

The signal that is a doublet of triplets of quartets would have undergone three levels of splitting.

So, the first split is into a doublet (coupled with one H), then each of those splits into triplets (coupled with two H's), then each of those splits into quartets (coupled with three H's). So the proton must be adjacent to a group with three H's, which is a CH3.

Therefore, the correct structure must have a CH that's adjacent to a CH3 group, making the adjacent CH's H's split the proton's signal.

Looking at the options, which structure has a CH adjacent to a CH3?

Option D: CH3CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

In this case, the first CH is part of CH2CH3, which is attached to the first CH(CH3). So the CH2CH3's CH is adjacent to the CH(CH3)'s CH. The CH(CH3) has a CH3 substituent. So the first CH's H is adjacent to the CH(CH3)'s H, which is adjacent to a CH3.

Wait, perhaps the H on the first CH (part of CH2CH3) is adjacent to the H on the CH(CH3), which is adjacent to the CH3. So the H on the first CH would couple with the H on CH(CH3), which in turn couples with the CH3's H's. But coupling through two bonds is usually small and may not be significant enough to cause observable splitting in the NMR. So perhaps this doesn't account for the quartet.

Alternatively, perhaps the H on the CH(CH3) is adjacent to the CH3 group's H's, leading to a quartet, but that would require the H on CH(CH3) to be adjacent to three H's, which is possible.

Wait, in option D, the H on the CH(CH3) is adjacent to a CH3 group. So the H on CH(CH3) would be adjacent to three H's (from the CH3), leading to a quartet (n=3 → 4 peaks). But wait, the H on CH(CH3) is attached to the CH3, so it's adjacent to the CH3's H's. But coupling between H's on adjacent carbons (like CH(CH3) and CH3) is possible, but typically, such coupling is small and may not lead to significant splitting. However, if it does, the H on CH(CH3) would split into a quartet.

But in the NMR data, one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets, which would imply the proton is coupled with three different groups: one with one H, another with two H's, and another with three H's. That seems very complex, but perhaps it's possible.

So, the H on the CH(CH3) in option D would be adjacent to:

- The H on the previous CH (one H → doublet)
- The H on the adjacent CH (one H → doublet)
- The H's on the CH3 group (three H's → quartet)

Wait, but the H on CH(CH3) is adjacent to the CH3's H's, but that would require coupling through three bonds (C-C-C), which is possible but usually not strong enough to cause a quartet. However, in some cases, like in CH(CH3) groups, coupling can be observed.

So, the H on CH(CH3) would be split into a quartet (from CH3's three H's), a doublet (from adjacent CH's H), and a doublet (from previous CH's H). But that would result in a quartet of doublets of doublets, which is a very complex pattern.

In the given data, one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets, which is a different order. So perhaps this is the case in option D.

Therefore, perhaps option D is the correct answer.


The question involves identifying a compound based on FTIR and ¹H NMR data. The FTIR spectrum shows a broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹, indicative of an O-H stretch (likely from a carboxylic acid), and a strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carbonyl group. The ¹H NMR spectrum reveals complex splitting patterns: one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. None of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens, ruling out any double bonds.
