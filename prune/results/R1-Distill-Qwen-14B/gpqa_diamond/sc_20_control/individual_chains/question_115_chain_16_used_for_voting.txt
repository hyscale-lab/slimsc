Okay, let's try to figure out this physics problem. Hmm, so the question is about an electron and a positron colliding and producing two photons. Both have the same energy, and their directions are given. I need to find the angle between them.

Wait, electrons and positrons are matter and antimatter, right? When they annihilate, they produce photons. Since they have opposite charges, the electron is moving left to right (from the left) and the positron is moving right to left (from the right). Oh wait, no, wait. The question says the electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. The positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. So their initial momenta are in opposite directions.

Wait, Lorentz factor is gamma. So for each particle, their relativistic momentum is gamma * m * v. But since they are moving towards each other, their momenta are opposite in direction.

But wait, when they annihilate, they produce two photons. The problem says both photons have the same energy. So, since energy is the same for both, and they have different directions, but the same energy. I need to find the angle between them.

I remember that in such processes, conservation of momentum and energy must hold. Since photons have momentum and energy, the total momentum before must equal the total after.

But wait, the initial particles are an electron and a positron. Both have the same mass, right? The electron's momentum is gamma_e * m * v_e, and the positron's is gamma_p * m * v_p. But since they are moving towards each other, their momenta are opposite. So the total initial momentum would be the sum of their individual momenta, but considering direction.

Wait, let's think about it. Let me assign directions. Let's say the horizontal axis is the x-axis. The electron is moving to the right, say in the positive x-direction. The positron is moving to the left, negative x-direction.

So the electron's momentum is p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e, and the positron's momentum is p_p = gamma_p * m_p * v_p. But since the positron is moving left, its momentum is in the negative x-direction. So the total initial momentum is p_e (positive) minus p_p (because it's negative). Wait, no. The positron's momentum as per direction would have a negative sign.

Wait, so the total initial momentum is p_initial = p_e (right) + p_p (left). But since p_p is in the opposite direction, it's p_initial = gamma_e * m_e * v_e - gamma_p * m_p * v_p. Wait no, because the positron's velocity is in the opposite direction, so its momentum is negative. So if the positron's velocity is to the left, its momentum is negative. So the initial total momentum is the sum of p_e (positive) and p_p (negative). So p_initial = (gamma_e * m_e * v_e) + (gamma_p * m_p * v_p) * (-1) because direction is opposite.

Wait, but since they are both moving in opposite directions, their velocities are opposite. So the momenta are in opposite directions. So the total initial momentum is p_e - p_p, if p_p is the magnitude of the positron's momentum.

Wait, but the positron's Lorentz factor is 2, and the electron's is 4. Since both have same mass (because they are electron and positron), the momentum would be p_e = gamma_e * m * v_e, and p_p = gamma_p * m * v_p.

But wait, Lorentz factor gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So if gamma_e is 4, then v_e is higher than v_p if gamma_p is 2. Because higher gamma implies higher velocity, closer to c.

Wait, but for the same mass, higher gamma means higher momentum if velocity is higher. So the electron has a higher gamma, so higher momentum.

Wait, but since the electron is moving to the right and the positron to the left, their momenta are opposite. So initial momentum is p_initial = p_e (right) + p_p (left). Wait, but p_p is in the opposite direction, so it's p_initial = p_e - p_p, where p_p is the magnitude.

Wait, no. Think in terms of vectors. The electron's momentum is +p_e (right), the positron's is -p_p (left). So the sum is p_initial = p_e - p_p.

Wait, but wait, the positron's momentum is in the opposite direction. So the initial momentum is the sum of the two, but considering their directions. So p_initial = p_e (right) + (-p_p) (because the positron is moving left). So p_initial = p_e - p_p.

But wait, the positron's momentum is gamma_p * m * v_p. So if the positron is moving left, its velocity is negative, so v_p is negative. So the positron's momentum p_p = gamma_p * m * v_p is negative (since v_p is negative). So the initial momentum is p_e + p_p (but p_p is negative). So p_initial = p_e + p_p.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the momentum in terms of their velocities. Let me think: the electron has a velocity v_e to the right (positive x), and the positron has velocity v_p to the left (negative x). So their momenta are p_e = gamma_e * m * v_e and p_p = gamma_p * m * v_p. But v_p is negative, so p_p is negative.

So the total initial momentum is p_initial = p_e + p_p = gamma_e * m * v_e + gamma_p * m * v_p.

But wait, since the positron is moving to the left, v_p is negative, so p_p is negative. So if I compute p_initial, I can calculate the momentum's direction.

But let's proceed.

Now, after the collision, the two photons are produced. Each photon has energy E. So the energy of both photons is same. Let's denote each photon's energy as E1 and E2, which are equal. So E1 = E2 = E.

Photons carry momentum, and their momentum is E/(c), and the direction depends on their movement. The momentum vector for a photon is E/c in the direction of motion. So each photon's momentum is E/(c) in their respective directions.

But the problem states that the photons are moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions. So each photon is moving in the right direction, but one is above the x-axis and the other is below. So their momenta vectors are symmetric with respect to the x-axis.

Wait, but the initial system has some momentum. So when the photons are emitted, their total momentum must equal the initial system's momentum.

Let me think about the momentum of the photons. Let me denote photon 1's momentum as p1, photon 2's as p2. Since both photons have the same energy, their magnitudes are the same.

The direction of each photon is given. One is in upper-right (so some angle theta above x-axis), the other in lower-right (angle theta below x-axis, but maybe 180 - theta? Hmm, no, because they are both moving in the right direction.)

Wait, no. The problem states the directions are upper-right and lower-right, which suggests that both are moving to the right but in different vertical directions. So, for example, one photon is moving at an angle of theta above the x-axis (upper-right), and the other at an angle of theta below the x-axis (lower-right). Or maybe not symmetric? Wait, but their energies are the same, so their magnitudes of momentum are same. So if their angles are symmetric about the x-axis, their y-components would cancel, but their x-components add.

But let me think: the total momentum of the two photons must equal the initial momentum of the electron and positron.

So, let's model this:

Initial momentum (p_initial) is the sum of the electron's and positron's momenta.

After collision, the photons' momenta must sum to this p_initial.

So let's compute p_initial.

Electron: gamma_e = 4, so gamma_e = 4. Therefore, the electron's velocity v_e can be found from gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

gamma_e = 4 => 4^2 = 1/(1 - v_e²/c²) => 16(1 - v_e^2/c^2) =1 => 1- v_e^2/c^2= 1/16 => v_e^2/c^2 = 15/16 => v_e = (sqrt(15)/4) c ≈ (3.87298)/4 c ≈ 0.96824 c.

Similarly, for the positron, gamma_p =2. So gamma_p^2 =4=1/(1 - v_p^2/c^2) => 4(1 - v_p^2/c^2) =1 → 1 - v_p^2/c^2 = 1/4 → v_p^2/c^2=3/4 → v_p = (sqrt(3)/2) c ≈0.8660 c.

But wait, the positron is moving to the left, so v_p is negative. So the positron's velocity is - (sqrt(3)/2) c.

So, the electron's momentum: p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e =4 m_e (sqrt(15)/4 c )= m_e (sqrt(15) c) ≈ m_e * 3.87298 c.

Wait, wait. Wait, gamma_e is 4, and v_e is (sqrt(15)/4) c.

So, p_e = gamma_e m_e v_e =4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4 c ) = m_e * sqrt(15) c.

Similarly, positron's momentum: p_p = gamma_p m_e v_p = 2 * m_e * (-sqrt(3)/2 c) ) = - m_e * sqrt(3) c.

So initial momentum p_initial = p_e + p_p = m_e sqrt(15) c - m_e sqrt(3) c = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Hmm, that's the initial momentum.

Now, after the annihilation, two photons are produced with equal energy, and their directions are upper-right and lower-right.

Let me denote the direction of each photon. Let’s say photon 1 makes an angle θ above the x-axis, and photon 2 makes an angle θ below the x-axis, but both moving to the right. Wait, no. Because the directions are upper-right and lower-right; that could mean that both are moving to the right, but one is above the x-axis and the other is below.

Wait, but in that case, their x-components would add, and the y-components would cancel each other.

Wait, but the total initial momentum is along the x-axis. So the total momentum of the photons must also be along the x-axis. Because the initial system has no momentum along y. So, the sum of the y-components of the photons' momenta must be zero. Because the initial system's y-momentum is zero.

So, the two photons must have equal and opposite y-components. Hence, their angles with respect to the x-axis must be symmetric. So photon 1's angle is +θ, photon 2's is -θ (same magnitude, opposite signs).

So, their momenta in the y-direction are E1/(c) sinθ and E2/(c) sin(-θ). Since E1=E2=E, the y-components are E/(c) sinθ and -E/(c) sinθ, which cancel each other.

In the x-direction, their momenta are E/(c) cosθ each. So the total x-momentum from the photons is 2 E/(c) cosθ.

But the initial x-momentum is m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

So, equate the two:

2 E/(c) cosθ = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

But wait, the energy of each photon is E = h f, but also E = p c, where p is the magnitude of the photon's momentum. So for each photon, E = (E/(c)) c = E. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think: for a photon, E = p c, where p is the magnitude of the momentum vector.

So each photon's momentum magnitude is E/(c). So the x-component is (E/(c)) cosθ.

So the total x-momentum from both photons is 2 * (E/(c)) cosθ.

Which must equal the initial momentum in the x-direction, which is m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

So:

2 (E/(c)) cosθ = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

But what about the energy? The total energy after annihilation should equal the total energy before.

So, the initial energy is the sum of the electron's and positron's energies.

Electron's energy: E_e = gamma_e m_e c² =4 m_e c².

Positron's energy: E_p = gamma_p m_e c² =2 m_e c².

So initial energy is E_initial = 4 m_e c² + 2 m_e c² =6 m_e c².

After annihilation, the energy is the sum of the two photons' energies: E1 + E2 = 2 E.

This must equal E_initial.

So, 2 E =6 m_e c² → E =3 m_e c².

Wait, wait. That can't be right because the rest mass energy of an electron is about 0.511 MeV, but the sum here is 6 times that, which is possible. So each photon would have energy E=3 m_e c².

Wait, but let me compute that. E =3 m_e c².

But wait, putting this back into the momentum equation.

We have:

2 (E / c) cosθ = initial momentum.

E=3 m_e c² → E/c=3 m_e c.

So,

2 * (3 m_e c) cosθ = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Divide both sides by m_e c:

2 *3 cosθ = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

So,

6 cosθ = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).

Compute the right-hand side numerically.

sqrt(15) is approx 3.87298, sqrt(3) is approx 1.73205.

So sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈ 3.87298 -1.73205 ≈ 2.14093.

So,

6 cosθ ≈2.14093 → cosθ ≈2.14093/6 ≈0.35682.

Then θ ≈ arccos(0.35682) ≈69 degrees.

Wait, but wait, this would be the angle each photon makes with the x-axis. But one is in the upper right and the other in the lower right, meaning their angles are +θ and -θ. So the angle between them is 2θ ≈ 138 degrees? Because the two photons are symmetric about the x-axis, so the angle between their directions would be 2θ.

Wait, no. Let me think. The angle between them is the angle between their direction vectors. Since one is at +θ and the other at -θ, the angle between them is 2θ, yes.

So 2θ is approximately 138 degrees, which would match option C, which is 138.

Wait, but let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, initial momentum is p_initial = m_e c (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)).

E=3 m_e c².

So each photon's momentum magnitude is E/c=3 m_e c.

So the x-component of each photon's momentum is 3 m_e c cosθ.

Total x-component: 2 *3 m_e c cosθ =6 m_e c cosθ.

Set equal to p_initial:

6 m_e c cosθ = m_e c (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)).

Divide both sides by m_e c:

6 cosθ = sqrt(15)-sqrt(3) → sqrt(15)=3.87298, sqrt(3)=1.73205 → 3.87298-1.73205=2.14093.

So cosθ=2.14093/6 ≈0.35682.

θ= arccos(0.35682)= about 69 degrees.

So the angle between the two photons is 2θ=138 degrees. So the answer is option C) 138.

To solve the problem, we analyze the collision and annihilation process using conservation of momentum and energy principles.

### Initial Setup
1. **Initial Momentum**:
   - The electron has a Lorentz factor \( \gamma_e = 4 \), and the positron has \( \gamma_p = 2 \).
   - The relativistic momentum of a particle is \( p = \gamma m v \). For the electron and positron:
     \[
     p_e = \gamma_e m_e v_e = 4 m_e \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4} c = m_e c \sqrt{15},
     \]
     \[
     p_p = \gamma_p m_e v_p = 2 m_e \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} c = m_e c \sqrt{3}.
     \]
   - Since the positron is moving to the left (negative x-direction), its momentum is subtracted:
     \[
     p_{\text{initial}} = p_e - p_p = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}).
     \]

2. **Initial Energy**:
   - The total energy of the system before annihilation is the sum of the electron and positron energies:
     \[
     E_{\text{initial}} = \gamma_e m_e c^2 + \gamma_p m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2.
     \]

### After Annihilation
1. **Photon Energies**:
   - After annihilation, two photons are produced with equal energies \( E_1 = E_2 = E \). Since energy is conserved:
     \[
     2E = 6 m_e c^2 \implies E = 3 m_e c^2.
     \]

2. **Photon Momenta**:
   - Each photon has momentum \( p = \frac{E}{c} = \frac{3 m_e c^2}{c} = 3 m_e c \).
   - The photons move in the upper-right and lower-right directions, making angles \( +\theta \) and \( -\theta \) with the x-axis, respectively.

3. **Conservation of Momentum**:
   - The total momentum of the photons must equal the initial momentum of the system. The x-components of the photons' momenta are:
     \[
     p_{\text{total}, x} = 2 \cdot \frac{E}{c} \cos\theta = 2 \cdot 3 m_e c \cos\theta = 6 m_e c \cos\theta.
     \]
   - Equating this to the initial momentum:
     \[
     6 m_e c \cos\theta = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}).
     \]
   - Dividing through by \( m_e c \):
     \[
     6 \cos\theta = \sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}.
     \]
   - Compute \( \sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3} \):
     \[
     \sqrt{15} \approx 3.87298, \quad \sqrt{3} \approx 1.73205 \implies \sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3} \approx 2.14093.
     \]
   - Solve for \( \cos\theta \):
     \[
     \cos\theta = \frac{2.14093}{6} \approx 0.35682.
     \]
   - Find \( \theta \):
     \[
     \theta \approx \arccos(0.35682) \approx 69^\circ.
     \]

4. **Angle Between Photons**:
   - The two photons are symmetric about the x-axis, with angles \( +\theta \) and \( -\theta \). The angle between them is:
     \[
     2\theta \approx 2 \cdot 69^\circ = 138^\circ.
     \]

### Final Answer
The angle between the directions of the photons is **138 degrees**.
