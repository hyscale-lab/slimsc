Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The question involves two reactions performed by an organic chemist. I need to determine the products of each reaction and then see how they behave in different HPLC columns.

Reaction I uses (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one with LAH followed by acidic workup. Reaction II uses pentane-2,4-dione with excess NaBH4 and acidic workup. The products are combined and run on both a normal-phase HPLC and a chiral HPLC column. The question is about how many peaks will appear in each.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, I'll figure out what each reaction does.

Starting with Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH. LAH is a strong reducing agent, usually reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So the ketone group at position 3 would become a secondary alcohol. The structure is (S) configuration; when reduced, the stereochemistry might change, but wait, LAH is a strong reducing agent that typically gives the most substituted alcohol. Wait, but in this case, the ketone is in a specific configuration. Let me visualize the structure.

The starting compound is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So hexan-3-one means the ketone is on carbon 3. The structure is: CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Let me count the carbons. Hexan-3-one is (CH2)2-CO-(CH2)3CH3. But wait, the substituents on the carbons adjacent to the ketone are important.

Wait, the structure is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the molecule is:

CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait. Wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2-CO-(CH2)3. So position 5 is the fifth carbon. So the structure would be:

CH2CH2-CO-CH(CH2CH3)-OCH3? Wait, maybe I should draw it. Let me think: hexan-3-one: positions 1 to 6. Carbon 3 is the carbonyl. So:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: C=O
Carbon 4: CH2
Carbon 5: CH2
Carbon 6: CH3? Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2COCH2CH2CH3. Wait, no, that's pentan-3-one. Hexan-3-one would be (CH2)2CO(CH2)3CH3? Wait, maybe it's better to write the structure as:

1   2   3   4   5   6
CH2-CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3. But wait, the 5-methoxy group is on carbon 5. So the structure is:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5 6.

So, position 3 is the ketone. Position 5 has a methoxy group (OCH3). So the structure is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2-OCH3-CH2? Wait, no. Let me think again. Hexan-3-one is (CH2)2-CO-(CH2)3. So carbon 3 is the carbonyl. Carbon 5 would be the third carbon from the ketone on the right side. Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2? No, wait. Wait, the substituent is on carbon 5. So the structure would be:

Positions 1 2 3 4 5 6.

1: CH3
2: CH2
3: C=O
4: CH2
5: CH(OCH3)
6: CH2CH3? Or maybe it's a different arrangement. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

The structure is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, the 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So at position 5, which is the fifth carbon from the end, there's a methoxy group. Hmm, perhaps it's better to consider that the molecule is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2?

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the structure of 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2COCH2CH2CH3. So the carbonyl is on C3. Then, the 5 position is the third carbon after the ketone. So that's CH2COCH2CH(OCH3)CH2CH3? No, perhaps I'm complicating this. Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The molecule is: CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3. So, the ketone is on C3, and the OCH3 is on C5. So when we reduce this with LAH, which is a strong reducing agent, the ketone (C=O) at C3 will be reduced to an alcohol. So the product would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Wait, but LAH is a strong reducing agent, typically used in ethers, and it reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So, yes, the product would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, but what about the stereochemistry? Wait, the starting material is (S) configuration. When the ketone is reduced to an alcohol, the configuration at that carbon will change.

Wait, the starting material is (S) at C5? No, wait. The starting material is (S) at the chiral center where the OCH3 is attached. So the configuration is at C5. When we reduce the ketone at C3, which is a planar sp2 center, the resulting alcohol will have a new chiral center at C3, but it's possible that the configuration is racemic because the reduction of a ketone with LAH typically leads to a racemic mixture.

Wait, but wait: LAH is a strong reducing agent, but under what conditions? LAH is used in an anhydrous ether solution, and the reduction of ketones with LAH typically leads to the formation of a secondary alcohol. Since the ketone is planar, the attack by the hydride can occur from either face, leading to a racemic mixture. But wait, the starting material is (S) configuration at C5. Oh wait, no, the starting material is (S) at the C5, which is adjacent to the ketone at C3. So when we reduce the ketone at C3, which is a different carbon, the configuration at C5 (OCH3) remains. So the product will have a new chiral center at C3, and possibly a new stereoisomer there. Because LAH can't induce any specific stereochemistry in the reduction (since it's a ketone), the product will form a racemic mixture at C3.

Wait, but the starting material is (S) at C5, which is a chiral center. When the ketone is reduced, the C3 becomes a new chiral center. So the product of Reaction I will be a racemic mixture of 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, because the reduction of the ketone creates a new chiral center, and since it's a ketone (not a prochiral situation, but wait, wait, no: the ketone is already in a chiral environment? Or is it prochiral?

Wait, the starting material has a chiral center at C5 (the OCH3 is attached there). The C3 is a carbonyl group, which is adjacent to C2 and C4. So C3 is the carbonyl, which is sp2 hybridized, so when we reduce that, we get a secondary alcohol at C3, which is now attached to two different groups: the C2 (CH2 group) and the C4 (which is CH2-OCH3).

Wait, perhaps the starting molecule is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the structure is:

Carbon chain: 1 2 3 4 5 6

1: CH3
2: CH2
3: CO
4: CH2
5: CH(OCH3)
6: CH2CH3?

Wait, no, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO(CH2)3CH3. So the structure is CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3. But wait, that would be 3-pentanone if it's a five-carbon chain. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The compound is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH2CH3?

Wait, no, perhaps it's:

Positions 1 to 6:

1: CH3
2: CH2
3: C=O
4: CH2
5: CH(OCH3)
6: CH2CH3?

Wait, that can't be right because that would make the carbonyl at position 3, and the OCH3 at position 5.

So the molecule is (S) configuration at C5. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3. Wait, no, that would make position 5 the same as position 5 in a six-carbon chain. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

The molecule is: 

CH2-CH2-CO-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, that's seven carbons. Oh wait, no, hexan-3-one is six carbons, so positions 1 to 6. So 1: CH3, 2: CH2, 3: C=O, 4: CH2, 5: CH(OCH3), 6: CH2CH3? No, that would require seven carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of it as:

The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the carbonyl is at C3. The OCH3 is at C5. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that's 6 carbons, but wait, maybe the structure is:

O
|
OCH3 is attached to the fifth carbon of hexan-3-one.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. The product of Reaction I is the reduction of the ketone to an alcohol. So, the starting material is a ketone, so after LAH reduction, we get a secondary alcohol. The chiral centers would be at C3 (new) and C5 (existing).

But wait, the starting material is (S) configuration at C5. So, after reduction, the C3 becomes a new chiral center, and since the reduction leads to racemic mixture, the product will have two possible stereoisomers at C3, but the C5 remains S configuration.

Wait, but wait: the starting material has a chiral center at C5, which is attached to OCH3, a CH2 group, and another CH2 group? Or maybe not. Let me think again. The structure of 5-methoxyhexan-3-one.

The correct IUPAC name would be 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the longest chain has six carbons with the ketone at position 3. The methoxy group is on carbon 5.

So the structure is:

1: CH3
2: CH2
3: C=O
4: CH2
5: CH(OCH3)
6: CH2CH3?

Wait, that would make it 6 carbons. So, positions:

1: CH3
2: CH2
3: CO
4: CH2
5: CH(OCH3)
6: CH2CH3?

Wait, that can't be because position 5 would be the fifth carbon, which would be attached to the CO at position 3. So the structure is:

Positions 1 2 3 4 5 6:

1: CH3
2: CH2
3: C=O
4: CH2
5: CH(OCH3)
6: CH2CH3.

Wait, but that's only six carbons. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3? Hmm, perhaps not. Maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let's think of it as:

The molecule is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2-OCH3-CH2CH3? No, that would be 5-methoxy, but the OCH3 is on the fifth carbon.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:

Positions 1: CH3
2: CH2
3: C=O
4: CH2
5: CH2-OCH3
6: CH2CH3.

No, because that would put the OCH3 on C5, but in that case, carbon 5 would be CH2-OCH3. So when reduced, the product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Wait, but the starting material is (S) configuration at C5. So when we reduce the ketone at C3, the new chiral center is at C3. So the product will have a new chiral center at C3, which could be R or S, leading to a racemic mixture. But the C5 remains as (S), so each stereoisomer at C3 will have the same configuration at C5.

So the product of Reaction I is a racemic mixture of 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Because the reduction of the ketone creates a new chiral center at C3, which is a secondary alcohol, and the configuration there is racemic.

Wait, but wait a second. LAH (lithium aluminum hydride) is a strong reducing agent, and when it reduces a ketone, it typically forms a secondary alcohol. The reaction is SN2-like, but for ketones, the mechanism is different. The hydride attacks the carbonyl carbon, leading to a tetrahedral intermediate which then eliminates the aluminum oxide. Since the starting ketone is not chiral at the carbonyl carbon (it's sp2), the reduction can lead to both enantiomers, creating a racemic mixture.

But wait, in this case, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, which already has a chiral center at C5. So the product will have that same configuration at C5, and a new chiral center at C3, which is racemic.

Therefore, Reaction I gives a racemic mixture of 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. So two enantiomers: (R) and (S) at C3, each with (S) configuration at C5.

Wait, no, because the starting material is (S) at C5, that configuration remains. So the product will have two stereoisomers: one where C3 is R and C5 is S, and another where C3 is S and C5 is S.

Wait, no, perhaps. Because the product has two chiral centers: C3 and C5. The starting material has C5 as S, and after reduction, C3 becomes a new chiral center. So the product has two possible stereoisomers at C3, each with C5 as S. So the product is a racemic mixture at C3.

Wait, that would give two enantiomers, each with the same configuration at C5.

So, in total, the product from Reaction I is a mixture of two diastereomers? No, wait. Because the configuration at C5 is fixed as S, and the configuration at C3 is either R or S, the two possible products are enantiomers. Because changing the configuration at C3 and keeping C5 the same would produce two non-superimposable mirror images.

Wait, no, because if two molecules have the same configuration at some stereocenters and opposite at others, they are diastereomers. But in this case, the only changing stereocenter is C3. So if C5 is fixed as S, then changing C3 from R to S would produce enantiomers, because the only difference is in the configuration of C3.

Wait, no, because the molecule has two stereocenters. So, if C3 is R and C5 is S, that's one enantiomer. If C3 is S and C5 is S, that's another enantiomer. So the product is a racemic mixture of these two enantiomers.

So Reaction I gives a 50:50 mixture of (S,S) and (R,S) configurations? Wait, no, because the starting material is (S) at C5, so the product's C5 remains (S). So, the product will have the same configuration at C5, and the new C3 will be either R or S, leading to two enantiomers. So, the product is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers.

Now, moving to Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by acidic workup.

Pentane-2,4-dione is (CH3)COCH2COCH2CH3. Wait, no, wait. The structure is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3? No, pentane-2,4-dione is (CH3)COCH2COCH2CH3. Wait, no, pentane has five carbons. So, pentane-2,4-dione is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3. No, wait, wait. Let me count: position 2 and 4 have ketone groups. So:

O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3. Wait, that's five carbons. So the structure is (CH3)C(O)CH2C(O)CH2CH3? No, wait, maybe it's O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3. That would be correct for pentane-2,4-dione.

But wait, wait, perhaps it's O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3, which has five carbons in total: 1 (O), 2 (C), 3 (CH2), 4 (CO), 5 (CH3). No, wait, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Wait, pentane is five carbons. The diones are at positions 2 and 4. So the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3. So that's positions 2 and 4: each has a ketone. So the structure is (CH2CO)2.

When NaBH4 is used, it's a milder reducing agent than LAH. NaBH4 typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols, but it's not as strong as LAH. However, NaBH4 cannot reduce esters or amides, but in this case, we have two ketones.

But wait, pentane-2,4-dione has two ketone groups. When treated with excess NaBH4, both ketones will be reduced.

So each ketone becomes a secondary alcohol. So the product will have two secondary alcohol groups.

But wait, let me think about the mechanism. NaBH4 acts as a reducing agent, and in this case, both ketones will be reduced.

So the product of Reaction II would be (HOCH2)2C(OH)CH2CH3? No, wait. Let me think again. The structure of pentane-2,4-dione is:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.

Wait, no, that can't be right because that's four carbons. Oh wait, pentane-2,4-dione would be CH2(CO)CH2(CO)CH3? No, perhaps:

The structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. That would make it 2,4-pentanedione. So, when reduced with NaBH4, each ketone is converted to a secondary alcohol.

So the product would be CH3-CHOH-CH2-CHOH-CH3.

Wait, but that's (2R,4R) or (2S,4S) or a mixture.

Wait, but NaBH4 is a strong enough reducing agent to reduce ketones, but in the case of a diketone like 2,4-pentanedione, how does the reduction proceed? Since each ketone is in a symmetrical position, perhaps the product would be a single compound?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The molecule is symmetric: the two ketones are at positions 2 and 4, with a CH2 group in between. So the structure is:

O
||
CH2-C-O
   |
   CH2-C-O
      |
      CH3

Wait, perhaps I should write the structure as:

O
||
CH2-C-O
   |
   CH2-C-O
      |
      CH3

Wait, no, the correct structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3. Wait, that's not correct because that would be 2,4-pentanedione, which is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2CH3? No, wait. Let me count the carbons properly.

Pentane has five carbons. 2,4-dione would be:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: C=O
Carbon 3: CH2
Carbon 4: C=O
Carbon 5: CH3.

Wait, no. So the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3? No, that’s six carbons. Wait, perhaps it's (CH3)COCH2COCH3. That has five carbons: two ketone groups on carbons 2 and 4.

So when NaBH4 is added, both ketones are reduced. Each becomes a secondary alcohol. So the product is (CH3)CHOHCH2CHOHCH3. Wait, but that structure can't be right because that would require five carbons. Wait, no: it's (CH3)CH(OH)CH2CH(OH)CH3, which is 2,4-pentanediol.

But since the two ketones are symmetrical, when reduced, the alcohols would be on carbons 2 and 4, which are symmetric. So the product would be a single compound, 2,4-pentanediol, which is a meso compound.

Wait, because the molecule has a plane of symmetry, so the two stereocenters (C2 and C4) would be mirror images of each other. So the product is a meso compound, which is achiral.

Wait, let me think. The structure after reduction would be:

HOCH2CH(OH)CH2CH2OH ? No, wait. Wait, the starting material is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3. So when reduced, each ketone becomes an alcohol. So the product is HOCH2CH2CH2CH2OH? No, no. Wait, no, the structure is:

O
||
CH2-C-O becomes CH2-CHOH
   |
   CH2-C-O becomes CH2-CHOH
      |
      CH3

So the product would be CH2(OH)CH2CH2CH2OH? No, that can't be right. Let me get this right. The correct structure after reduction is (CH3)CHOHCH2CHOHCH3. Wait, no, that would require six carbons. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me think again.

The correct structure for pentane-2,4-dione is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. So when reduced, each C=O becomes CHOH. So the product would be CH3-CHOH-CH2-CHOH-CH3.

Wait, that would make the structure (CH3)CH(OH)CH2CH(OH)CH3. So this molecule has two chiral centers at C2 and C4. But due to the symmetry, the configurations would be opposite, leading to a meso compound.

So, the product is a meso compound, which is achiral. So it's a single compound, not a mixture.

Wait, because the molecule has a plane of symmetry between C2 and C4. So if C2 is R and C4 is S, the molecule is achiral. Therefore, the product is a single compound, 2,4-pentanediol (meso form), which is not chiral.

So Reaction II gives a single product, which is a meso compound, hence not chiral.

Now, combining the products from both reactions.

Product from Reaction I: racemic mixture of two enantiomers of 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. So, two distinct compounds (enantiomers).

Product from Reaction II: a single meso compound, 2,4-pentanediol.

So the combined products are three compounds: two enantiomers (from Reaction I) plus one compound from Reaction II.

Wait, but wait: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol has two stereocenters (C3 and C5), but in Reaction I, the C5 was already a stereocenter with S configuration, and C3 becomes a new stereocenter, giving two enantiomers (since in the product, each has opposite configuration at C3, but same at C5).

So yes, two enantiomers, making a racemic mixture. So the combined products are:

- Two enantiomers from Reaction I: each with C3 as R and S, and C5 as S.

- One product from Reaction II: meso compound, which is a single compound.

Now, when we run them on HPLC columns.

First, normal-phase HPLC: this is based on the polarity of the compounds. The stationary phase is polar (like silica), and the mobile phase is non-polar. So more polar compounds elute later.

The products are:

1. Two enantiomers of 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol: these are secondary alcohols, relatively polar.

2. 2,4-pentanediol: a diol, which is more polar than the alcohols but less than, say, a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but in terms of elution order, more polar compounds would have higher retention times. So the diol would be more polar than the secondary alcohols?

Wait, secondary alcohols are less polar than diols. Because diols have two hydroxyl groups, which increase polarity. So 2,4-pentanediol is more polar than 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. So in normal-phase HPLC, the diol would come out later than the secondary alcohols.

But the secondary alcohols from Reaction I are a racemic mixture. So, how would they resolve on normal-phase HPLC? Well, enantiomers can't be separated on a normal-phase column unless the column is chiral. Because normal-phase HPLC doesn't distinguish between enantiomers; they have the same polarity.

So, in normal-phase HPLC, the two enantiomers from Reaction I would co-elute as a single peak, because they have the same physical properties (same polarity). The diol from Reaction II would have a different polarity, so it would be a separate peak.

So, in normal-phase HPLC, there would be two peaks: one for the two enantiomers (as a single peak) and one for the diol.

Wait, but wait, no. Because the two enantiomers have the same physical properties except for chirality. So in a normal column, they would not separate. So, for normal-phase HPLC, you would see two peaks: one for the racemic mixture (the two enantiomers as one peak) and one for the diol. So total of two peaks.

Wait, but wait: the two enantiomers from Reaction I are two distinct compounds, but they have the same physical properties except for their chirality. So in a normal (achiral) column, they'd co-elute as a single peak. The diol is another compound, so that's a second peak. So normal-phase HPLC would have two peaks.

Now, the chiral HPLC column. This column is designed to separate enantiomers because it has a chiral stationary phase. So the two enantiomers from Reaction I would elute as separate peaks, each with their own retention time. The diol from Reaction II is a meso compound, which is not chiral, so it would not be separated by a chiral HPLC column. Wait, no. Wait, the diol is a meso compound, meaning it's achiral. So when run on a chiral column, would it elute as a single peak? Yes, because it doesn't interact with the chiral stationary phase in a way that causes it to separate into enantiomers. So the diol would elute as a single peak.

Wait, but let me think again. The chiral column separates enantiomers because the stationary phase is chiral. If the compound itself is not chiral, then it would not be separated. So the diol, being a meso compound (achiral), would elute as a single peak on the chiral column.

So, on the chiral column, the two enantiomers from Reaction I would each be separated into their own peaks, and the diol would come out as a single peak. So total of three peaks.

Wait, no. Because the diol is a single compound, it's just one peak. The two enantiomers would each be a peak. So total of three peaks on the chiral column.

Wait, but let me double-check. Reaction I gives two enantiomers. Reaction II gives one compound. So on the chiral column:

- Enantiomer 1 from Reaction I: one peak.
- Enantiomer 2 from Reaction I: another peak.
- Diol from Reaction II: one peak.

So three peaks in total on the chiral column.

On the normal-phase column:

- Racemic mixture (two enantiomers as one peak).
- Diol: another peak.

So two peaks.

Wait, but wait, what about the diol's elution on the normal-phase column. Since it's a diol, it's more polar than the secondary alcohol. So its peak would come after the secondary alcohol.

But in the question, after the reactions are 100% complete, the products are combined and run. So the combined mixture would have both products.

So, for normal-phase HPLC:

- Two enantiomers of 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol: same polarity, so same peak.
- 2,4-pentanediol: another peak.

So two peaks.

For chiral-phase HPLC:

- Each enantiomer of 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol: two peaks.
- 2,4-pentanediol: one peak.

So three peaks.

Wait, but wait, the diol is being combined with the other product. So in the chiral column, it would elute as a single peak, but what about its interactions?

In a chiral column, the stationary phase is chiral. For a compound that is not chiral, like the diol (meso), it might not interact with the stationary phase in a way that causes it to split into enantiomers because it's not chiral. So on the chiral column, the diol would elute as a single peak, while the two enantiomers would each have their own peak.

So, in the chiral column, three peaks in total.

But wait, let me think again. The diol from Reaction II is a single compound. It's a meso compound, so it's not chiral. So on a chiral HPLC column, how would it behave? Chiral columns are used to separate enantiomers. If the compound isn't chiral, it would interact with the stationary phase in a way that doesn't depend on the presence of enantiomers. So it would elute as a single peak.

So, in the chiral column, the two enantiomers from Reaction I (each as separate peaks) and the diol as a single peak. So three peaks in total.

On the normal-phase column, the two enantiomers co-elute, and the diol as another. So two peaks.

So, looking at the options:

The question asks how many peaks the chemist observes in each chromatogram.

So, normal-phase HPLC would show 2 peaks.

Chiral HPLC would show 3 peaks.

Looking at the options, option D says 3 peaks in both, which is not correct. Option B says 3 in chiral and 2 in normal, which matches what I have. Let me check the options.

Options:

A) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC → No, that's too many.

B) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC → Yes, this matches.

C) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC → No, because Reaction II gives only one product.

D) 3 peaks in both → No, because normal has 2 peaks.

So the correct answer is option B: 3 in chiral, 2 in normal.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves analyzing the products of two reactions and their behavior in normal-phase HPLC and chiral HPLC columns. Here's the analysis:

### Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup
- **Reaction details**: LAH reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol, creating a new chiral center at C3. The starting material is (S)-configured at C5, which remains unchanged.
- **Products**: A racemic mixture of two enantiomers of 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Each enantiomer has the same configuration at C5 (S), but opposite configurations at C3 (R and S).

### Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione treated with excess NaBH4 followed by acidic workup
- **Reaction details**: NaBH4 reduces both ketones in pentane-2,4-dione to secondary alcohols. The product is 2,4-pentanediol, a meso compound due to its plane of symmetry. This compound is achiral and appears as a single product.

### Combined Products
- **From Reaction I**: Two enantiomers of 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.
- **From Reaction II**: One achiral compound, 2,4-pentanediol.
- **Total products**: Three compounds (two enantiomers and one achiral compound).

### Behavior in HPLC Columns
1. **Normal-phase HPLC**:
   - Enantiomers have the same polarity and co-elute as a single peak.
   - The achiral diol (2,4-pentanediol) has a different polarity and elutes as a separate peak.
   - **Total peaks**: 2.

2. **Chiral HPLC**:
   - The two enantiomers of 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol are separated into two distinct peaks due to the chiral stationary phase.
   - The achiral diol (2,4-pentanediol) does not interact with the chiral stationary phase in a stereospecific manner and elutes as a single peak.
   - **Total peaks**: 3.

### Evaluation of Options
- **Option A**: 5 peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC → Incorrect, as there are only three products.
- **Option B**: 3 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC → Correct, matches the analysis.
- **Option C**: 4 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC → Incorrect, as there are only three products.
- **Option D**: 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC → Incorrect, as normal-phase HPLC shows 2 peaks.

### Final Answer
**Answer: B**
