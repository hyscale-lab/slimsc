Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let's see, I think I can figure this out by breaking it down step by step. So, the question is about finding the expectation value of an operator involving sigma_z and sigma_x for a given spin-half particle state.

Alright, the particle is in a superposition state: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. These |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of sigma_z. I remember that for spin-1/2 particles, sigma_z has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, respectively.

The operator we're looking at is 10σ_z +5σ_x. The expectation value of an operator is given by ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where O is the operator. So I'll need to compute the expectation value of each term separately and then add them together.

Let me write down the state again: ψ equals 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let me check the normalization. The coefficients squared add up: (0.5)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 0.25 + (3/4) = 1. So yes, it's normalized.

First, compute the expectation of 10σ_z.

Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σ_z, the expectation value of σ_z is just the weighted average of their eigenvalues.

The eigenvalues for σ_z are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩.

So, ⟨σ_z⟩ = |0.5|^2 * (+1) + |sqrt(3)/2|^2 * (-1).

Wait, no, actually, the expectation value is calculated as the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their eigenvalues. The coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2, so their squares are 0.25 and 0.75 respectively.

So ⟨σ_z⟩ = (0.5)^2 * (+1) + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * (-1) = 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

Then, the expectation value for 10σ_z is 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now, the second part is the expectation value of 5σ_x. Hmm, σ_x is the Pauli X matrix, which doesn't have |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ as eigenstates. Oh right, because σ_x is the spin in the x-direction, and its eigenstates are the |+x⟩ and |-x⟩ states, which are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩.

So, to find ⟨σ_x⟩, I need to compute the expectation value using the given state ψ.

The Pauli matrices are defined as:

σ_x = [[0, 1],
        [1, 0]]

σ_y = [[0, -i],
        [i, 0]]

σ_z = [[1, 0],
        [0, -1]]

So, the matrix for σ_x is as above. But another approach is to use the formula for expectation value without getting into matrix multiplication. Alternatively, perhaps express ψ in terms of σ_x eigenstates.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to compute it directly.

The expectation value ⟨σ_x⟩ is ψ† σ_x ψ.

So, writing ψ as a column vector:

|ψ⟩ = [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]

Then, σ_x |ψ⟩ is the matrix multiplied by ψ.

Wait, no, the expectation value is ⟨ψ| σ_x |ψ⟩.

So, compute σ_x |ψ⟩:

σ_x * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2] = [ sqrt(3)/2 , 0.5 ]^T.

So, ⟨ψ| σ_x |ψ⟩ is the inner product of ψ† and σ_x |ψ⟩.

Which is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5.

So that's 0.5*0.866/2? Wait, wait, wait. Let's compute each term.

0.5 times sqrt(3)/2 is (0.5 * 1.732/2) → 0.5 * 0.866 → approximately 0.433.

Wait, but let me compute it exactly symbolically.

Wait, sqrt(3) is about 1.732, so sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866. So 0.5 * 0.866 is 0.433. The other term is the same, so 0.433 +0.433 = 0.866. So ⟨σ_x⟩ = sqrt(3)/2.

Wait, sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866.

Wait, but wait, let me compute it step by step.

⟨σ_x⟩ = (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = 2*(0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) )= 2*(sqrt(3)/4) )= sqrt(3)/2.

Which is approximately 0.866.

So the expectation value of 5σ_x is 5 * (sqrt(3)/2) ≈5 *0.866 ≈4.33.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the general formula for expectation of σ_x.

Alternatively, the expectation value of σ_x for a state α|↑⟩ + β|↓⟩ is (α β* + α* β ) because σ_x is represented by the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]], so the expectation value is 2 Re(α β^*).

Wait, yeah, because in general, for a state α|0⟩ + β|1⟩, the expectation of σ_x is 2 Re(α β*). Because ⟨0|σ_x|0⟩ is 0, ⟨0|σ_x|1⟩ is 1, and so on.

So in our case, α is 0.5 and β is sqrt(3)/2. Let's compute 2 Re( α β^* ).

But wait, since both coefficients are real numbers, because 0.5 is real, sqrt(3)/2 is real. So α β^* is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) = (sqrt(3))/4. The real part is the same as the value, so 2*(sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866. So that's correct.

So the expectation value of σ_x is sqrt(3)/2, so 5σ_x gives 5*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈5*0.866 ≈4.33.

So putting it all together, the total expectation value is:

10⟨σ_z⟩ +5⟨σ_x⟩ = (-5) + (4.33) ≈-0.67.

Wait, wait, because 10σz gives -5, and 5σx gives about 4.33. So adding those gives -5 +4.33 = -0.67.

Wait, but wait, let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, 10σ_z's expectation is 10*(-0.5) = -5.

5σx's expectation is 5*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈5*(0.8660) ≈4.3301.

So total expectation is (-5) +4.3301 = -0.6699.

So approximately -0.67, which to one decimal is -0.7.

Looking at the options:

A) -1.4

B) 1.65

C) -0.7

D) 0.85

So option C is -0.7. So the answer should be C.

To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given spin-half particle state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is computed as \( \langle \psi | (10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x) | \psi \rangle \), which can be broken into two parts: \( 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle \) and \( 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle \).

### Step 1: Expectation value of \( \sigma_z \)
The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) correspond to eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \) for \( \sigma_z \), respectively. The expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is given by:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = (0.5)^2 \cdot (+1) + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 \cdot (-1).
\]
Calculating the coefficients squared:
\[
(0.5)^2 = 0.25, \quad \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 0.75.
\]
Thus:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 0.25 \cdot (+1) + 0.75 \cdot (-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]
The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z \) is:
\[
10\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 10 \cdot (-0.5) = -5.
\]

### Step 2: Expectation value of \( \sigma_x \)
The operator \( \sigma_x \) is represented by the Pauli matrix:
\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
For a state \( \psi = \alpha|\uparrow\rangle + \beta|\downarrow\rangle \), the expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2\text{Re}(\alpha \beta^*).
\]
Here, \( \alpha = 0.5 \) and \( \beta = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \), both of which are real. Thus:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2 \cdot \left(0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = 2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]
Approximating \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866 \), the expectation value of \( 5\sigma_x \) is:
\[
5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 5 \cdot 0.866 \approx 4.33.
\]

### Step 3: Total expectation value
Adding the contributions from \( 10\sigma_z \) and \( 5\sigma_x \):
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]
Rounding to one decimal place, the expectation value is \( -0.7 \).

### Final Answer
Comparing with the options:
- A) \( -1.4 \),
- B) \( 1.65 \),
- C) \( -0.7 \),
- D) \( 0.85 \),

the correct answer is **C**.

Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σ_z, the expectation value of σ_z is just the weighted average of their eigenvalues.

The eigenvalues for σ_z are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩.

So, ⟨σ_z⟩ = |0.5|^2 * (+1) + |sqrt(3)/2|^2 * (-1).

Wait, no, actually, the expectation value is calculated as the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their eigenvalues. The coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2, so their squares are 0.25 and 0.75 respectively.

So ⟨σ_z⟩ = (0.5)^2 * (+1) + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * (-1) = 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

Then, the expectation value for 10σ_z is 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now, the second part is the expectation value of 5σ_x. Hmm, σ_x is the Pauli X matrix, which doesn't have |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ as eigenstates. Oh right, because σ_x is the spin in the x-direction, and its eigenstates are the |+x⟩ and |-x⟩ states, which are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩.

So, to find ⟨σ_x⟩, I need to compute the expectation value using the given state ψ.

The Pauli matrices are defined as:

σ_x = [[0, 1],
        [1, 0]]

σ_y = [[0, -i],
        [i, 0]]

        [0, -1]]

So, the matrix for σ_x is as above. But another approach is to use the formula for expectation value without getting into matrix multiplication. Alternatively, perhaps express ψ in terms of σ_x eigenstates.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to compute it directly.

The expectation value ⟨σ_x⟩ is ψ† σ_x ψ.

So, writing ψ as a column vector:

|ψ⟩ = [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]

Then, σ_x |ψ⟩ is the matrix multiplied by ψ.

Wait, no, the expectation value is ⟨ψ| σ_x |ψ⟩.

So, compute σ_x |ψ⟩:

σ_x * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2] = [ sqrt(3)/2 , 0.5 ]^T.

So, ⟨ψ| σ_x |ψ⟩ is the inner product of ψ† and σ_x |ψ⟩.

Which is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5.

So that's 0.5*0.866/2? Wait, wait, wait. Let's compute each term.

0.5 times sqrt(3)/2 is (0.5 * 1.732/2) → 0.5 * 0.866 → approximately 0.433.

Wait, but let me compute it exactly symbolically.

Wait, sqrt(3) is about 1.732, so sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866. So 0.5 * 0.866 is 0.433. The other term is the same, so 0.433 +0.433 = 0.866. So ⟨σ_x⟩ = sqrt(3)/2.

Wait, sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866.

Wait, but wait, let me compute it step by step.

⟨σ_x⟩ = (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = 2*(0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) )= 2*(sqrt(3)/4) )= sqrt(3)/2.

Which is approximately 0.866.

So the expectation value of 5σ_x is 5 * (sqrt(3)/2) ≈5 *0.866 ≈4.33.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the general formula for expectation of σ_x.

Alternatively, the expectation value of σ_x for a state α|↑⟩ + β|↓⟩ is (α β* + α* β ) because σ_x is represented by the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]], so the expectation value is 2 Re(α β^*).

Wait, yeah, because in general, for a state α|0⟩ + β|1⟩, the expectation of σ_x is 2 Re(α β*). Because ⟨0|σ_x|0⟩ is 0, ⟨0|σ_x|1⟩ is 1, and so on.

So in our case, α is 0.5 and β is sqrt(3)/2. Let's compute 2 Re( α β^* ).

But wait, since both coefficients are real numbers, because 0.5 is real, sqrt(3)/2 is real. So α β^* is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) = (sqrt(3))/4. The real part is the same as the value, so 2*(sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866. So that's correct.

So the expectation value of σ_x is sqrt(3)/2, so 5σ_x gives 5*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈5*0.866 ≈4.33.

So putting it all together, the total expectation value is:

10⟨σ_z⟩ +5⟨σ_x⟩ = (-5) + (4.33) ≈-0.67.

Wait, wait, because 10σz gives -5, and 5σx gives about 4.33. So adding those gives -5 +4.33 = -0.67.

Wait, but wait, let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, 10σ_z's expectation is 10*(-0.5) = -5.

5σx's expectation is 5*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈5*(0.8660) ≈4.3301.

So total expectation is (-5) +4.3301 = -0.6699.

So approximately -0.67, which to one decimal is -0.7.

Looking at the options:

A) -1.4

To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given spin-half particle state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is computed as \( \langle \psi | (10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x) | \psi \rangle \), which can be broken into two parts: \( 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle \) and \( 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle \).

### Step 1: Expectation value of \( \sigma_z \)
The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) correspond to eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \) for \( \sigma_z \), respectively. The expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is given by:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = (0.5)^2 \cdot (+1) + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 \cdot (-1).
\]
Calculating the coefficients squared:
\[
(0.5)^2 = 0.25, \quad \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 0.75.
\]
Thus:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 0.25 \cdot (+1) + 0.75 \cdot (-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]
The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z \) is:
\[
10\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 10 \cdot (-0.5) = -5.
\]

### Step 2: Expectation value of \( \sigma_x \)
The operator \( \sigma_x \) is represented by the Pauli matrix:
\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
For a state \( \psi = \alpha|\uparrow\rangle + \beta|\downarrow\rangle \), the expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2\text{Re}(\alpha \beta^*).
\]
Here, \( \alpha = 0.5 \) and \( \beta = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \), both of which are real. Thus:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2 \cdot \left(0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = 2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]
Approximating \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866 \), the expectation value of \( 5\sigma_x \) is:
\[
5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 5 \cdot 0.866 \approx 4.33.
\]

### Step 3: Total expectation value
Adding the contributions from \( 10\sigma_z \) and \( 5\sigma_x \):
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]
Rounding to one decimal place, the expectation value is \( -0.7 \).

### Final Answer
Comparing with the options:
- A) \( -1.4 \),
- B) \( 1.65 \),
- C) \( -0.7 \),
- D) \( 0.85 \),

the correct answer is **C**.
