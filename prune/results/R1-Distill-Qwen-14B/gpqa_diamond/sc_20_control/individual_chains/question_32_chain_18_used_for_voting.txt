Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and calculating the energy of a nucleus. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let me see if I can work through this.

The question says: What is the energy of RHIC so that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c? X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the right one.

First, I need to figure out what nucleus X is. Li is lithium. The isotopes of lithium have different numbers of neutrons. So Li-3 would have 3 neutrons. Wait, but wait. Lithium typically has an atomic number of 3, so Li-3 would have 3 protons and 3 neutrons, making it Li-6? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. Oh wait, maybe I got that wrong. Oh wait, Li has Z=3. So if it's Li with 3 neutrons, the isotope would be Li-6 (3+3=6). Or wait, maybe the question says X is Li with 3 neutrons, so the mass number A is 3 (protons) +3 (neutrons) = 6. So the nucleus is Li-6.

So the nucleus is Li-6. I'll need its mass to calculate the energy.

But wait, when dealing with relativistic particles, the energy depends on their mass and speed. The formula I remember for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m * c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Given that the speed v is 0.96c, I can compute gamma first.

Let me compute gamma:

v = 0.96c

So beta (β) is v/c = 0.96.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)

Let me compute 0.96 squared: 0.96 * 0.96 = 0.9216.

So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

Taking the square root of 0.0784: sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28.

So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.57142857.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me calculate that again. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, so sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, correct. So 1/0.28 is approximately 3.57142857.

But wait, let me compute it more accurately. Oh wait, 0.28 is exactly 7/25, so 1/(7/25) is 25/7 ≈3.57142857.

So gamma is about 3.5714.

Now, the next step is to find the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The energy E is gamma times m c squared. So I need the mass of Li-6.

The atomic mass of Li-6 can be found from the periodic table. Let me think, the atomic mass of Li is about 6.941 g/mol. But wait, Li-6 is an isotope. The exact mass can be found using the table. Alternatively, perhaps I can approximate the mass as roughly similar to the proton mass multiplied by the number of nucleons.

Wait, wait, but I think the exact value is needed here. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the mass of Li-6 in terms of u (atomic mass units) and then convert it to GeV/c².

Wait, the mass of a single Li-6 nucleus is the number of nucleons times the mass of a nucleon, minus binding energy, but that's probably too detailed for this problem. Maybe they just want us to use the mass of a proton and neutron, but considering that for a nucleus, the mass is approximately A times the mass of a nucleon, but with a small correction for binding energy.

Alternatively, maybe a better approach is to take the mass of Li-6 as being approximately 6 times the mass of a proton, but that's probably not precise enough. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the mass given for a Li-6 nucleus.

Wait, I think I can recall that the mass of a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c² and a proton is 938.272 MeV/c². So each nucleon is roughly about 938.5 MeV/c².

But for a nucleus, the actual mass is a bit less due to binding energy. However, for the purpose of this calculation, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of a single nucleon multiplied by the number of nucleons, ignoring binding energy? Or perhaps the mass is given as the sum of protons and neutrons.

Wait, but let me think: the exact mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.016 amu (atomic mass units). Wait, I think the exact value is about 6.016 amu.

Wait, let me check: the isotope Li-6 has a mass of approximately 6.01512 amu. Let me confirm. Or maybe it's 6.016. I'm a bit unsure, but perhaps I can proceed with that.

So, 1 atomic mass unit (u) is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg. But more importantly, I can convert 1 u to energy using E=mc², which is about 931.5 MeV per u.

So, the mass of Li-6 nucleus is 6.016 u. Let me compute the rest mass energy in GeV.

So, 6.016 u * 931.5 MeV/u = 6.016 * 931.5 MeV.

Calculating that: 6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV, and 0.016 *931.5= ~14.9 MeV. So total is 5589 +14.9 = 5603.9 MeV, which is 5.6039 GeV.

Wait, but that's the rest mass energy. The total energy is gamma times that.

Gamma is approximately 3.5714, so E = 3.5714 * 5.6039 GeV.

Let me compute that: 3 *5.6039 is 16.8117. 0.5714 *5.6039.

Wait, 5.6039 * 0.5 = 2.80195, 5.6039 *0.0714≈5.6039 * 0.07 ≈0.39227, 0.0014*5.6039≈0.007845. So total 2.80195 +0.39227=3.19422 +0.007845≈3.202. So 3.5714 *5.6039≈16.8117 +3.202 ≈20.0137 GeV.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should do this more accurately. Let me compute 5.6039 *3.5714.

Alternatively, 5.6039 *3.5714 = ?

Let me compute 5.6039 *3 =16.8117.

5.6039 *0.5 =2.80195.

5.6039 *0.0714= Let's see, 5.6039 *0.07 = 0.392273. 5.6039 *0.0014=0.007845. So 0.392273 +0.007845=0.400118.

So adding all together: 16.8117 +2.80195=19.61365 +0.400118=20.013768 GeV.

So the total energy would be approximately 20.01377 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Option D is 21.419 GeV, which is higher than that. Option B is 23.069 GeV, way higher. Option A is 18.475, which is lower.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the mass calculation?

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the mass of Li-6. Let me look up the exact mass of Li-6.

Wait, I think the exact mass of Li-6 is about 6.01512 u. Let me use that.

So, m = 6.01512 u.

So, converting to MeV/c²: 6.01512 * 931.5 MeV/u ≈ ?

6 *931.5 =5589 MeV.

0.01512 *931.5 = Let me compute that: 0.01 *931.5 =9.315, 0.005 *931.5=4.6575, 0.00012 *931.5≈0.11178.

Adding: 9.315 +4.6575 =13.9725 +0.11178=14.08428 MeV.

So total is 5589 +14.08428=5603.08428 MeV, which is 5.60308428 GeV.

Now, E = gamma * m c² = 3.57142857 *5.60308428 GeV.

Let me compute that more precisely.

3.57142857 *5.60308428.

Hmm, perhaps I can do it step by step.

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.60308428.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 5.60308428 *3.57142857.

Let me compute:

5.60308428 *3 =16.80925284.

5.60308428 *0.57142857.

Wait, 0.57142857 is approximately 4/7.

So 5.60308428 * (4/7) = (5.60308428 *4)/7 =22.41233712 /7 ≈3.201762446.

So total is 16.80925284 +3.201762446 =20.01101529 GeV.

So approximately 20.011 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher than 20.011. Hmm, perhaps my approximation for the mass is a bit off, or maybe I should consider the exact value.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the mass. Let me double-check the mass of Li-6.

Another approach: the exact mass of Li-6 is about 6.01512 u. So maybe I should use a more accurate value for the conversion from u to MeV/c².

Wait, 1 u = 931.494061 MeV/c².

So 6.01512 u * 931.494061 MeV/u = ?

So, 6 *931.494061 = 5588.964366 MeV.

0.01512 *931.494061 = ?

Compute 0.01 *931.494061 =9.31494061 MeV.

0.005 *931.494061 =4.657470305 MeV.

0.00012 *931.494061 =0.111779287 MeV.

Adding those together: 9.31494061 +4.657470305=13.972410915 +0.111779287=14.0841902 MeV.

So total is 5588.964366 +14.0841902 =5603.048556 MeV, which is 5.603048556 GeV.

Now, gamma is 25/7 ≈3.571428571.

So E =3.571428571 *5.603048556 GeV.

Let me compute that.

3.571428571 *5.603048556.

Let me compute 3 *5.603048556 =16.80914567.

0.571428571 *5.603048556.

Compute 5.603048556 *0.5 =2.801524278.

5.603048556 *0.071428571.

Wait, 0.071428571 is 1/14, so 5.603048556 /14 ≈0.400217754.

So 2.801524278 +0.400217754 =3.201742032.

Now, adding to the previous 16.80914567 +3.201742032 =20.0108877 GeV.

So about 20.0109 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is 0.1211 GeV higher, which is about 121 MeV. That's a significant difference. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem didn't specify that it's a proton or a neutron, but the nucleus as a whole. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the mass of the entire nucleus, including binding energy. Wait, but when we use the atomic mass in u, that already includes binding energy, right? Because the mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of individual protons and neutrons by the mass defect, which is the binding energy.

Wait, but when calculating the rest mass energy, I should use the exact mass of the nucleus. So perhaps I should use the exact mass of Li-6 in u.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the mass in kilograms and then calculate the energy.

Wait, but using the exact numbers, perhaps I can compute it more accurately.

Let me try that. The mass of Li-6 is 6.01512 u.

1 u = 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So m =6.01512 * 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

m =6.01512 *1.6605390666e-27 ≈?

6 *1.660539e-27 =9.963234e-27.

0.01512 *1.660539e-27 ≈0.02512e-27? Wait, let me compute 0.01512 *1.660539e-27.

0.01 *1.660539e-27 =1.660539e-29.

0.005 *1.660539e-27 =8.302695e-30.

0.00012 *1.660539e-27=1.9926468e-30.

Adding all together: 1.660539e-29 +8.302695e-30 =2.4908085e-29 +1.9926468e-30 =2.6900732e-29 kg.

So m =9.963234e-27 kg +2.6900732e-29 kg ≈9.963234e-27 +0.026900732e-27 =9.990134e-27 kg.

Now, E = gamma * m c².

c is 3e8 m/s.

m c² =9.990134e-27 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2.

(3e8)^2=9e16 m²/s².

So m c² =9.990134e-27 kg *9e16 m²/s² = 9.990134e-27 *9e16 =8.9911206e-10 J.

Now, gamma is 25/7≈3.571428571.

So E =3.571428571 *8.9911206e-10 J.

Calculating 3.571428571 *8.9911206e-10.

3 *8.9911206e-10 =2.69733618e-9 J.

0.571428571 *8.9911206e-10 = let's compute 0.5 *8.9911206e-10 =4.4955603e-10.

0.071428571 *8.9911206e-10 ≈0.71428571e-9 *8.9911206e-10? Wait, no. 0.071428571 is (1/14), so 8.9911206e-10 *1/14 ≈6.422229e-11.

So adding all parts: 4.4955603e-10 +6.422229e-11 =5.1377832e-10 J.

So total E =2.69733618e-9 +5.1377832e-10 ≈3.2111145e-9 J.

Now, converting J to GeV.

1 eV =1.60218e-19 J.

1 GeV =1e9 eV =1.60218e-10 J.

So E =3.2111145e-9 J / (1.60218e-10 J/GeV) )= (3.2111145e-9) / (1.60218e-10) ) GeV.

Dividing: 3.2111145e-9 /1.60218e-10 = (3.2111145 / 0.160218 ) ) [since 1e-9 /1e-10=10].

Wait, 3.2111145e-9 /1.60218e-10 = (3.2111145 / 1.60218 ) * 10 ≈ (2.003) *10 ≈20.03 GeV.

Hmm, so about 20.03 GeV.

Wait, but earlier calculations with the u method gave around 20.01 GeV, and this method gives 20.03 GeV. So approximately 20 GeV.

Looking back at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is about 0.1 GeV higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation. Let me recheck.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 -v²/c²) where v=0.96c.

v²/c² =0.96²=0.9216.

So 1 -0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma is 1/0.28=3.57142857. That part was correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps in the problem, X is 6Li, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, but wait, wait, the question says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Li has 3 protons, so 3+3=6 nucleons. So 6Li, correct.

Wait, perhaps the exact mass of 6Li is different. Let me look for a more precise value.

Upon checking, the exact mass of ⁶Li is 6.01512234 u.

So I'll use that.

So m =6.01512234 u.

Converted to MeV/c²: 6.01512234 *931.494 MeV/u.

Compute 6 *931.494 =5588.964 MeV.

0.01512234 *931.494.

Let me compute 0.01 *931.494 =9.31494.

0.005 *931.494 =4.65747.

0.00012234 *931.494 ≈0.1138 MeV.

Adding: 9.31494 +4.65747 =13.97241 +0.1138 ≈14.08621 MeV.

Total:5588.964 +14.08621=5603.05021 MeV =5.60305021 GeV.

Now, E =3.57142857 *5.60305021 GeV.

3 *5.60305021 =16.80915063.

0.57142857 *5.60305021.

Wait, let me compute 5.60305021 *0.57142857.

Hmm, 5.60305021 * (4/7) = (5.60305021 *4)/7 =22.41220084 /7 ≈3.201742977.

So E=16.80915063 +3.201742977 =20.0108936 GeV.

So about 20.0109 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C)20.132 GeV, but that's higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the energy per nucleon, but no, the problem states the nucleus.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let's recheck.

Wait, beta is 0.96, so beta squared is 0.9216. 1-beta squared is 0.0784. Square root is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28=3.57142857. That's correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the mass of the nucleus is not 6.01512 u, but higher or lower. Let me double-check the exact mass.

Upon checking, ⁶Li has a mass of approximately 6.01512234 u.

Maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to use the mass of a single nucleon and multiply by 6, but that would be 6 *938.272 MeV (proton) or 6 *939.565 MeV (neutron). Let's see.

Wait, but the nucleus is a mix of protons and neutrons. The exact mass would be the sum minus binding energy, but perhaps the problem is expecting me to use the mass as 6 * m_n, or 6 * m_p, or the average.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of the entire nucleus as the sum of each nucleon's rest mass, but that would be an overestimation because of binding energy. For example, 6 nucleons, each ~938 MeV, gives 6 *938 MeV =5628 MeV =5.628 GeV.

Then, E=gamma *5.628 GeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

3.57142857 *5.628 = ?

3 *5.628 =16.884.

0.57142857 *5.628 ≈0.57 *5.628≈3.207.

Total ≈16.884 +3.207=20.091 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 20.09 GeV, which is closer to option C (20.132 GeV) but still not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation would yield 20.13 GeV, which would match option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the binding energy consideration. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass of the nucleus is less than 6 nucleons due to binding energy, but that's what I initially accounted for when using 6.015 u, which is slightly above 6. So that can't be the case.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the nucleus is moving relativistically, so the energy is the total relativistic energy, which includes the rest energy and kinetic. But in any case, the calculation remains E=gamma m c².

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me think about the formula.

E = gamma * m * c².

We have E in GeV, m in GeV/c², and gamma as a pure number.

So, I need to compute:

E (GeV) = gamma * (m in GeV/c²).

So, m in GeV/c²: m =6.01512 u *931.494 MeV/u *1e-3 GeV/MeV.

So, m=6.01512 *0.931494 GeV/c².

Wait, 6.01512 *0.931494 = let's compute that.

6 *0.931494 =5.588964.

0.01512 *0.931494 ≈0.014095.

So total m ≈5.588964 +0.014095 =5.603059 GeV/c².

Then, gamma is 3.57142857.

E =3.57142857 *5.603059 = let me compute.

3 *5.603059 =16.809177.

0.57142857 *5.603059 ≈3.20176.

Total E =16.809177 +3.20176 =20.010937 GeV.

So approximately 20.0109 GeV.

Hmm, but none of the options exactly matches this. The closest option is C)20.132 GeV, but that's 0.12 GeV higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the mass. Let me compute 6.01512 *931.494 more accurately.

6.01512 * 931.494 = ?

Let me compute this as:

(6 +0.01512) *931.494 =6*931.494 +0.01512*931.494.

6*931.494 =5588.964.

0.01512 *931.494 = let's compute:

0.01 *931.494 =9.31494.

0.005 *931.494=4.65747.

0.00012 *931.494=0.11177928.

Adding those together: 9.31494 +4.65747=13.97241 +0.11177928=14.08418928.

So total is 5588.964 +14.08418928=5603.04818928 MeV, which is 5.603048189 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 *5.603048189 GeV.

3.57142857 *5.603048189.

Let me compute this as:

3 *5.603048189 =16.809144567.

0.57142857 *5.603048189.

0.5 *5.603048189 =2.8015240945.

0.07142857 *5.603048189.

0.07 *5.603048189=0.392213373.

0.00142857 *5.603048189≈0.007998.

So 0.392213373 +0.007998≈0.400211373.

So total for 0.57142857 part is 2.8015240945 +0.400211373 ≈3.2017354675.

Adding to the 3 * part:16.809144567 +3.2017354675 ≈20.0108800345 GeV.

So approximately 20.0109 GeV.

But the options don't have this value. The closest is option C)20.132 GeV. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should carry more precise numbers.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question uses the mass of the deuterium or another isotope, but no, the question specifies Li-6.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the exact calculation of gamma.

Wait, perhaps the exact value of gamma is not 25/7, but a more precise calculation.

Let me compute gamma with more precision.

v=0.96c.

So beta =0.96.

gamma =1/sqrt(1 - beta^2) =1/sqrt(1 -0.9216) =1/sqrt(0.0784).

sqrt(0.0784) =0.28 exactly.

So gamma is exactly 25/7=3.571428571428571...

So that part is correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the relativistic energy formula, but in the lab frame, perhaps considering the kinetic energy instead of the total energy.

Wait, no, the question asks for the energy, which in relativistic terms is the total energy.

Another possibility: perhaps the calculation is done using the speed as a fraction of c, but in terms of the lab frame, or perhaps using the kinetic energy instead of total energy.

Wait, but the question says the energy of the collider, which would be the total energy per nucleus.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should compute the energy per nucleon, but no, the problem is about the nucleus as a whole.

Wait, perhaps the mass of the nucleus is not 6.01512 u, but higher or lower. Let me check another source.

Upon checking, the exact mass of ⁶Li is 6.01512234 u. So I think that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects me to round the answer to four decimal places, but the options have varying precisions.

Wait, looking at the options:

A)18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV.

Wait, my calculation is 20.0109 GeV, which is approximately 20.011 GeV. But option C is 20.132 GeV, which is higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the mass of the deuteron or another nucleus, but no, the question clearly states X is Li with 3 neutrons, so ⁶Li.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation steps.

Wait, another angle: maybe the problem uses the mass in kg and calculates using more precise values.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma * m * c² with more precise values.

Let me compute m in kg:

m =6.01512234 u * 1.66053906660e-27 kg/u =6.01512234 *1.66053906660e-27.

Calculating that: 6 *1.6605390666e-27 =9.9632344e-27 kg.

0.01512234 *1.6605390666e-27 =0.01512234 *1.6605390666e-27 ≈2.500e-29 kg.

So m ≈9.9632344e-27 +2.500e-29 =9.9902344e-27 kg.

Now, gamma is 25/7 ≈3.571428571.

E =gamma * m * c².

c² is (3e8 m/s)^2 =9e16 m²/s².

So E =3.571428571 *9.9902344e-27 kg *9e16 m²/s².

Let me compute this step by step.

First, 9.9902344e-27 kg *9e16 m²/s² =8.99121096e-10 J.

Now, multiply by 3.571428571:

3.571428571 *8.99121096e-10 J =3.571428571 *8.99121096e-10 ≈3.210e-9 J.

Now, converting J to GeV: 1 J =6.24150934e18 eV =6.24150934e9 GeV.

So E =3.210e-9 J *6.24150934e9 GeV/J ≈3.210 *6.24150934 ≈20.01 GeV.

Again, same result.

Hmm, perhaps the options are given with more precise calculations. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the mass in a different way.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem uses the average mass of a nucleon, say 938.5 MeV/c², multiplied by 6, giving 5.631 GeV/c². Then, gamma is 3.5714, so 3.5714 *5.631 =20.13 GeV.

Ah! That's option C.

So, perhaps that's the approach the problem expects.

Wait, let me compute that:

6 nucleons *938.5 MeV/c² =6 *0.9385 GeV/c² =5.631 GeV/c².

Gamma=3.5714.

E=3.5714 *5.631 ≈?

3 *5.631 =16.893.

0.5714 *5.631 ≈3.212.

Total ≈20.105 GeV.

Which is close to option C, 20.132 GeV.

So perhaps the problem expects this approach, using the average nucleon mass.

If that's the case, the correct answer would be option C)20.132 GeV.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the Li-6 nucleus is 0.96c, we use the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor (\(\gamma\))
The speed of the nucleus is given as \(v = 0.96c\). The Lorentz factor is:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

Substituting \(v = 0.96c\):

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus
The mass of the Li-6 nucleus is approximately \(6.01512 \, \text{u}\), where \(1 \, \text{u} = 931.494 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\). Converting to GeV:

\[
m c^2 = 6.01512 \, \text{u} \times 931.494 \, \text{MeV/u} \times 10^{-3} \, \text{GeV/MeV} \approx 5.60305 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy
The total energy is:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

Substituting \(\gamma \approx 3.5714\) and \(m c^2 \approx 5.60305 \, \text{GeV}\):

\[
E = 3.5714 \times 5.60305 \approx 20.011 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated energy is approximately \(20.011 \, \text{GeV}\). However, the closest option provided is **C) 20.132 GeV**, which likely accounts for slight approximations or differences in the assumed mass of the nucleus. Therefore, the best match is:

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and calculating the energy of a nucleus. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let me see if I can work through this.

The question says: What is the energy of RHIC so that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c? X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the right one.

First, I need to figure out what nucleus X is. Li is lithium. The isotopes of lithium have different numbers of neutrons. So Li-3 would have 3 neutrons. Wait, but wait. Lithium typically has an atomic number of 3, so Li-3 would have 3 protons and 3 neutrons, making it Li-6? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. Oh wait, maybe I got that wrong. Oh wait, Li has Z=3. So if it's Li with 3 neutrons, the isotope would be Li-6 (3+3=6). Or wait, maybe the question says X is Li with 3 neutrons, so the mass number A is 3 (protons) +3 (neutrons) = 6. So the nucleus is Li-6.

So the nucleus is Li-6. I'll need its mass to calculate the energy.

But wait, when dealing with relativistic particles, the energy depends on their mass and speed. The formula I remember for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m * c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Given that the speed v is 0.96c, I can compute gamma first.

Let me compute gamma:

v = 0.96c

So beta (β) is v/c = 0.96.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)

Let me compute 0.96 squared: 0.96 * 0.96 = 0.9216.

So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

Taking the square root of 0.0784: sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28.

So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.57142857.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me calculate that again. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, so sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, correct. So 1/0.28 is approximately 3.57142857.

But wait, let me compute it more accurately. Oh wait, 0.28 is exactly 7/25, so 1/(7/25) is 25/7 ≈3.57142857.

So gamma is about 3.5714.

Now, the next step is to find the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The energy E is gamma times m c squared. So I need the mass of Li-6.

The atomic mass of Li-6 can be found from the periodic table. Let me think, the atomic mass of Li is about 6.941 g/mol. But wait, Li-6 is an isotope. The exact mass can be found using the table. Alternatively, perhaps I can approximate the mass as roughly similar to the proton mass multiplied by the number of nucleons.

Wait, wait, but I think the exact value is needed here. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the mass of Li-6 in terms of u (atomic mass units) and then convert it to GeV/c².

Wait, the mass of a single Li-6 nucleus is the number of nucleons times the mass of a nucleon, minus binding energy, but that's probably too detailed for this problem. Maybe they just want us to use the mass of a proton and neutron, but considering that for a nucleus, the mass is approximately A times the mass of a nucleon, but with a small correction for binding energy.

Alternatively, maybe a better approach is to take the mass of Li-6 as being approximately 6 times the mass of a proton, but that's probably not precise enough. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the mass given for a Li-6 nucleus.

Wait, I think I can recall that the mass of a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c² and a proton is 938.272 MeV/c². So each nucleon is roughly about 938.5 MeV/c².

But for a nucleus, the actual mass is a bit less due to binding energy. However, for the purpose of this calculation, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of a single nucleon multiplied by the number of nucleons, ignoring binding energy? Or perhaps the mass is given as the sum of protons and neutrons.

Wait, but let me think: the exact mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.016 amu (atomic mass units). Wait, I think the exact value is about 6.016 amu.

Wait, let me check: the isotope Li-6 has a mass of approximately 6.01512 amu. Let me confirm. Or maybe it's 6.016. I'm a bit unsure, but perhaps I can proceed with that.

So, 1 atomic mass unit (u) is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg. But more importantly, I can convert 1 u to energy using E=mc², which is about 931.5 MeV per u.

So, the mass of Li-6 nucleus is 6.016 u. Let me compute the rest mass energy in GeV.

So, 6.016 u * 931.5 MeV/u = 6.016 * 931.5 MeV.

Calculating that: 6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV, and 0.016 *931.5= ~14.9 MeV. So total is 5589 +14.9 = 5603.9 MeV, which is 5.6039 GeV.

Wait, but that's the rest mass energy. The total energy is gamma times that.

Gamma is approximately 3.5714, so E = 3.5714 * 5.6039 GeV.

Let me compute that: 3 *5.6039 is 16.8117. 0.5714 *5.6039.

Wait, 5.6039 * 0.5 = 2.80195, 5.6039 *0.0714≈5.6039 * 0.07 ≈0.39227, 0.0014*5.6039≈0.007845. So total 2.80195 +0.39227=3.19422 +0.007845≈3.202. So 3.5714 *5.6039≈16.8117 +3.202 ≈20.0137 GeV.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should do this more accurately. Let me compute 5.6039 *3.5714.

Alternatively, 5.6039 *3.5714 = ?

Let me compute 5.6039 *3 =16.8117.

5.6039 *0.5 =2.80195.

5.6039 *0.0714= Let's see, 5.6039 *0.07 = 0.392273. 5.6039 *0.0014=0.007845. So 0.392273 +0.007845=0.400118.

So adding all together: 16.8117 +2.80195=19.61365 +0.400118=20.013768 GeV.

So the total energy would be approximately 20.01377 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Option D is 21.419 GeV, which is higher than that. Option B is 23.069 GeV, way higher. Option A is 18.475, which is lower.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the mass calculation?

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the mass of Li-6. Let me look up the exact mass of Li-6.

Wait, I think the exact mass of Li-6 is about 6.01512 u. Let me use that.

So, m = 6.01512 u.

So, converting to MeV/c²: 6.01512 * 931.5 MeV/u ≈ ?

6 *931.5 =5589 MeV.

0.01512 *931.5 = Let me compute that: 0.01 *931.5 =9.315, 0.005 *931.5=4.6575, 0.00012 *931.5≈0.11178.

Adding: 9.315 +4.6575 =13.9725 +0.11178=14.08428 MeV.

So total is 5589 +14.08428=5603.08428 MeV, which is 5.60308428 GeV.

Now, E = gamma * m c² = 3.57142857 *5.60308428 GeV.

Let me compute that more precisely.

3.57142857 *5.60308428.

Hmm, perhaps I can do it step by step.

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.60308428.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 5.60308428 *3.57142857.

Let me compute:

5.60308428 *3 =16.80925284.

5.60308428 *0.57142857.

Wait, 0.57142857 is approximately 4/7.

So 5.60308428 * (4/7) = (5.60308428 *4)/7 =22.41233712 /7 ≈3.201762446.

So total is 16.80925284 +3.201762446 =20.01101529 GeV.

So approximately 20.011 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher than 20.011. Hmm, perhaps my approximation for the mass is a bit off, or maybe I should consider the exact value.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the mass. Let me double-check the mass of Li-6.

Another approach: the exact mass of Li-6 is about 6.01512 u. So maybe I should use a more accurate value for the conversion from u to MeV/c².

Wait, 1 u = 931.494061 MeV/c².

So 6.01512 u * 931.494061 MeV/u = ?

So, 6 *931.494061 = 5588.964366 MeV.

0.01512 *931.494061 = ?

Compute 0.01 *931.494061 =9.31494061 MeV.

0.005 *931.494061 =4.657470305 MeV.

0.00012 *931.494061 =0.111779287 MeV.

Adding those together: 9.31494061 +4.657470305=13.972410915 +0.111779287=14.0841902 MeV.

So total is 5588.964366 +14.0841902 =5603.048556 MeV, which is 5.603048556 GeV.

Now, gamma is 25/7 ≈3.571428571.

So E =3.571428571 *5.603048556 GeV.

Let me compute that.

3.571428571 *5.603048556.

Let me compute 3 *5.603048556 =16.80914567.

0.571428571 *5.603048556.

Compute 5.603048556 *0.5 =2.801524278.

5.603048556 *0.071428571.

Wait, 0.071428571 is 1/14, so 5.603048556 /14 ≈0.400217754.

So 2.801524278 +0.400217754 =3.201742032.

Now, adding to the previous 16.80914567 +3.201742032 =20.0108877 GeV.

So about 20.0109 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is 0.1211 GeV higher, which is about 121 MeV. That's a significant difference. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem didn't specify that it's a proton or a neutron, but the nucleus as a whole. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the mass of the entire nucleus, including binding energy. Wait, but when we use the atomic mass in u, that already includes binding energy, right? Because the mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of individual protons and neutrons by the mass defect, which is the binding energy.

Wait, but when calculating the rest mass energy, I should use the exact mass of the nucleus. So perhaps I should use the exact mass of Li-6 in u.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the mass in kilograms and then calculate the energy.

Wait, but using the exact numbers, perhaps I can compute it more accurately.

Let me try that. The mass of Li-6 is 6.01512 u.

1 u = 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So m =6.01512 * 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

m =6.01512 *1.6605390666e-27 ≈?

6 *1.660539e-27 =9.963234e-27.

0.01512 *1.660539e-27 ≈0.02512e-27? Wait, let me compute 0.01512 *1.660539e-27.

0.01 *1.660539e-27 =1.660539e-29.

0.005 *1.660539e-27 =8.302695e-30.

0.00012 *1.660539e-27=1.9926468e-30.

Adding all together: 1.660539e-29 +8.302695e-30 =2.4908085e-29 +1.9926468e-30 =2.6900732e-29 kg.

So m =9.963234e-27 kg +2.6900732e-29 kg ≈9.963234e-27 +0.026900732e-27 =9.990134e-27 kg.

Now, E = gamma * m c².

c is 3e8 m/s.

m c² =9.990134e-27 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2.

(3e8)^2=9e16 m²/s².

So m c² =9.990134e-27 kg *9e16 m²/s² = 9.990134e-27 *9e16 =8.9911206e-10 J.

Now, gamma is 25/7≈3.571428571.

So E =3.571428571 *8.9911206e-10 J.

Calculating 3.571428571 *8.9911206e-10.

3 *8.9911206e-10 =2.69733618e-9 J.

0.571428571 *8.9911206e-10 = let's compute 0.5 *8.9911206e-10 =4.4955603e-10.

0.071428571 *8.9911206e-10 ≈0.71428571e-9 *8.9911206e-10? Wait, no. 0.071428571 is (1/14), so 8.9911206e-10 *1/14 ≈6.422229e-11.

So adding all parts: 4.4955603e-10 +6.422229e-11 =5.1377832e-10 J.

So total E =2.69733618e-9 +5.1377832e-10 ≈3.2111145e-9 J.

Now, converting J to GeV.

1 eV =1.60218e-19 J.

1 GeV =1e9 eV =1.60218e-10 J.

So E =3.2111145e-9 J / (1.60218e-10 J/GeV) )= (3.2111145e-9) / (1.60218e-10) ) GeV.

Dividing: 3.2111145e-9 /1.60218e-10 = (3.2111145 / 0.160218 ) ) [since 1e-9 /1e-10=10].

Wait, 3.2111145e-9 /1.60218e-10 = (3.2111145 / 1.60218 ) * 10 ≈ (2.003) *10 ≈20.03 GeV.

Hmm, so about 20.03 GeV.

Wait, but earlier calculations with the u method gave around 20.01 GeV, and this method gives 20.03 GeV. So approximately 20 GeV.

Looking back at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is about 0.1 GeV higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation. Let me recheck.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 -v²/c²) where v=0.96c.

v²/c² =0.96²=0.9216.

So 1 -0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma is 1/0.28=3.57142857. That part was correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps in the problem, X is 6Li, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, but wait, wait, the question says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Li has 3 protons, so 3+3=6 nucleons. So 6Li, correct.

Wait, perhaps the exact mass of 6Li is different. Let me look for a more precise value.

Upon checking, the exact mass of ⁶Li is 6.01512234 u.

So I'll use that.

So m =6.01512234 u.

Converted to MeV/c²: 6.01512234 *931.494 MeV/u.

Compute 6 *931.494 =5588.964 MeV.

0.01512234 *931.494.

Let me compute 0.01 *931.494 =9.31494.

0.005 *931.494 =4.65747.

0.00012234 *931.494 ≈0.1138 MeV.

Adding: 9.31494 +4.65747 =13.97241 +0.1138 ≈14.08621 MeV.

Total:5588.964 +14.08621=5603.05021 MeV =5.60305021 GeV.

Now, E =3.57142857 *5.60305021 GeV.

3 *5.60305021 =16.80915063.

0.57142857 *5.60305021.

Wait, let me compute 5.60305021 *0.57142857.

Hmm, 5.60305021 * (4/7) = (5.60305021 *4)/7 =22.41220084 /7 ≈3.201742977.

So E=16.80915063 +3.201742977 =20.0108936 GeV.

So about 20.0109 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C)20.132 GeV, but that's higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the energy per nucleon, but no, the problem states the nucleus.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let's recheck.

Wait, beta is 0.96, so beta squared is 0.9216. 1-beta squared is 0.0784. Square root is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28=3.57142857. That's correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the mass of the nucleus is not 6.01512 u, but higher or lower. Let me double-check the exact mass.

Upon checking, ⁶Li has a mass of approximately 6.01512234 u.

Maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to use the mass of a single nucleon and multiply by 6, but that would be 6 *938.272 MeV (proton) or 6 *939.565 MeV (neutron). Let's see.

Wait, but the nucleus is a mix of protons and neutrons. The exact mass would be the sum minus binding energy, but perhaps the problem is expecting me to use the mass as 6 * m_n, or 6 * m_p, or the average.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of the entire nucleus as the sum of each nucleon's rest mass, but that would be an overestimation because of binding energy. For example, 6 nucleons, each ~938 MeV, gives 6 *938 MeV =5628 MeV =5.628 GeV.

Then, E=gamma *5.628 GeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

3.57142857 *5.628 = ?

3 *5.628 =16.884.

0.57142857 *5.628 ≈0.57 *5.628≈3.207.

Total ≈16.884 +3.207=20.091 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 20.09 GeV, which is closer to option C (20.132 GeV) but still not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation would yield 20.13 GeV, which would match option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the binding energy consideration. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass of the nucleus is less than 6 nucleons due to binding energy, but that's what I initially accounted for when using 6.015 u, which is slightly above 6. So that can't be the case.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the nucleus is moving relativistically, so the energy is the total relativistic energy, which includes the rest energy and kinetic. But in any case, the calculation remains E=gamma m c².

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me think about the formula.

E = gamma * m * c².

We have E in GeV, m in GeV/c², and gamma as a pure number.

So, I need to compute:

E (GeV) = gamma * (m in GeV/c²).

So, m in GeV/c²: m =6.01512 u *931.494 MeV/u *1e-3 GeV/MeV.

So, m=6.01512 *0.931494 GeV/c².

Wait, 6.01512 *0.931494 = let's compute that.

6 *0.931494 =5.588964.

0.01512 *0.931494 ≈0.014095.

So total m ≈5.588964 +0.014095 =5.603059 GeV/c².

Then, gamma is 3.57142857.

E =3.57142857 *5.603059 = let me compute.

3 *5.603059 =16.809177.

0.57142857 *5.603059 ≈3.20176.

Total E =16.809177 +3.20176 =20.010937 GeV.

So approximately 20.0109 GeV.

Hmm, but none of the options exactly matches this. The closest option is C)20.132 GeV, but that's 0.12 GeV higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the mass. Let me compute 6.01512 *931.494 more accurately.

6.01512 * 931.494 = ?

Let me compute this as:

(6 +0.01512) *931.494 =6*931.494 +0.01512*931.494.

6*931.494 =5588.964.

0.01512 *931.494 = let's compute:

0.01 *931.494 =9.31494.

0.005 *931.494=4.65747.

0.00012 *931.494=0.11177928.

Adding those together: 9.31494 +4.65747=13.97241 +0.11177928=14.08418928.

So total is 5588.964 +14.08418928=5603.04818928 MeV, which is 5.603048189 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 *5.603048189 GeV.

3.57142857 *5.603048189.

Let me compute this as:

3 *5.603048189 =16.809144567.

0.57142857 *5.603048189.

0.5 *5.603048189 =2.8015240945.

0.07142857 *5.603048189.

0.07 *5.603048189=0.392213373.

0.00142857 *5.603048189≈0.007998.

So 0.392213373 +0.007998≈0.400211373.

So total for 0.57142857 part is 2.8015240945 +0.400211373 ≈3.2017354675.

Adding to the 3 * part:16.809144567 +3.2017354675 ≈20.0108800345 GeV.

So approximately 20.0109 GeV.

But the options don't have this value. The closest is option C)20.132 GeV. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should carry more precise numbers.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question uses the mass of the deuterium or another isotope, but no, the question specifies Li-6.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the exact calculation of gamma.

Wait, perhaps the exact value of gamma is not 25/7, but a more precise calculation.

Let me compute gamma with more precision.

v=0.96c.

So beta =0.96.

gamma =1/sqrt(1 - beta^2) =1/sqrt(1 -0.9216) =1/sqrt(0.0784).

sqrt(0.0784) =0.28 exactly.

So gamma is exactly 25/7=3.571428571428571...

So that part is correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the relativistic energy formula, but in the lab frame, perhaps considering the kinetic energy instead of the total energy.

Wait, no, the question asks for the energy, which in relativistic terms is the total energy.

Another possibility: perhaps the calculation is done using the speed as a fraction of c, but in terms of the lab frame, or perhaps using the kinetic energy instead of total energy.

Wait, but the question says the energy of the collider, which would be the total energy per nucleus.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should compute the energy per nucleon, but no, the problem is about the nucleus as a whole.

Wait, perhaps the mass of the nucleus is not 6.01512 u, but higher or lower. Let me check another source.

Upon checking, the exact mass of ⁶Li is 6.01512234 u. So I think that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects me to round the answer to four decimal places, but the options have varying precisions.

Wait, looking at the options:

A)18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV.

Wait, my calculation is 20.0109 GeV, which is approximately 20.011 GeV. But option C is 20.132 GeV, which is higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the mass of the deuteron or another nucleus, but no, the question clearly states X is Li with 3 neutrons, so ⁶Li.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation steps.

Wait, another angle: maybe the problem uses the mass in kg and calculates using more precise values.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma * m * c² with more precise values.

Let me compute m in kg:

m =6.01512234 u * 1.66053906660e-27 kg/u =6.01512234 *1.66053906660e-27.

Calculating that: 6 *1.6605390666e-27 =9.9632344e-27 kg.

0.01512234 *1.6605390666e-27 =0.01512234 *1.6605390666e-27 ≈2.500e-29 kg.

So m ≈9.9632344e-27 +2.500e-29 =9.9902344e-27 kg.

Now, gamma is 25/7 ≈3.571428571.

E =gamma * m * c².

c² is (3e8 m/s)^2 =9e16 m²/s².

So E =3.571428571 *9.9902344e-27 kg *9e16 m²/s².

Let me compute this step by step.

First, 9.9902344e-27 kg *9e16 m²/s² =8.99121096e-10 J.

Now, multiply by 3.571428571:

3.571428571 *8.99121096e-10 J =3.571428571 *8.99121096e-10 ≈3.210e-9 J.

Now, converting J to GeV: 1 J =6.24150934e18 eV =6.24150934e9 GeV.

So E =3.210e-9 J *6.24150934e9 GeV/J ≈3.210 *6.24150934 ≈20.01 GeV.

Again, same result.

Hmm, perhaps the options are given with more precise calculations. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the mass in a different way.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem uses the average mass of a nucleon, say 938.5 MeV/c², multiplied by 6, giving 5.631 GeV/c². Then, gamma is 3.5714, so 3.5714 *5.631 =20.13 GeV.

Ah! That's option C.

So, perhaps that's the approach the problem expects.

Wait, let me compute that:

6 nucleons *938.5 MeV/c² =6 *0.9385 GeV/c² =5.631 GeV/c².

Gamma=3.5714.

E=3.5714 *5.631 ≈?

3 *5.631 =16.893.

0.5714 *5.631 ≈3.212.

Total ≈20.105 GeV.

Which is close to option C, 20.132 GeV.

So perhaps the problem expects this approach, using the average nucleon mass.

If that's the case, the correct answer would be option C)20.132 GeV.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is option C.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the Li-6 nucleus is 0.96c, we use the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor (\(\gamma\))
The speed of the nucleus is given as \(v = 0.96c\). The Lorentz factor is:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

Substituting \(v = 0.96c\):

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus
The mass of the Li-6 nucleus is approximately \(6.01512 \, \text{u}\), where \(1 \, \text{u} = 931.494 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\). Converting to GeV:

\[
m c^2 = 6.01512 \, \text{u} \times 931.494 \, \text{MeV/u} \times 10^{-3} \, \text{GeV/MeV} \approx 5.60305 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy
The total energy is:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

Substituting \(\gamma \approx 3.5714\) and \(m c^2 \approx 5.60305 \, \text{GeV}\):

\[
E = 3.5714 \times 5.60305 \approx 20.011 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated energy is approximately \(20.011 \, \text{GeV}\). However, the closest option provided is **C) 20.132 GeV**, which likely accounts for slight approximations or differences in the assumed mass of the nucleus. Therefore, the best match is:

**Answer: C**
