Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about electrophilic substitution reactions of certain aromatic compounds with excess bromine. I need to determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer for each substance. There are six compounds given, and I need to arrange them from the lowest to the highest para-isomer yield.

Hmm, right. So, each of these is a benzene derivative with a substituent. The substituents will direct the incoming electrophile (bromine) to specific positions: ortho, meta, or para. The reactivity and directing effects of each substituent will influence the major product.

Wait, but wait. The question says it's an excess of bromine, and only one monobromo derivative is formed. Oh, but wait, no, that's not exactly right. Monobromo substitution—so each benzene ring will have only one bromine added. But the position depends on the directing group.

So, the substituents on the benzene ring determine the site of bromination. For example, activating groups (like -NH2, -OH, -OCH3) are strong activating and ortho/para directors. Deactivating groups (like -NO2, -Cl, -COOH) are deactivating and meta directors. But wait, some substituents are deactivating but ortho/para directors. Like -SO3H and some halogens?

Wait, let me think. The halogens are a bit tricky. They are deactivating because the inductive effect (withdrawing electrons) is stronger than their resonance effect (which would donate electrons). So, -Cl is deactivating and ortho/para directing. Wait, no, wait. No, wait. The halogens have lone pairs, so in the case of -Cl, the resonance effect is weak because the Cl is more electronegative, so the inductive effect dominates, making them deactivating. But in terms of directing, they are ortho/para directors because of the lone pairs they can provide via resonance.

Wait, that's correct. For example, chlorobenzene undergoes bromination mostly in the para position because the Cl is a deactivating but ortho/para director. Because the inductive effect deactivates the ring, but the lone pairs can help stabilize the transition state in ortho and para positions.

But wait, some substituents are meta directors. So, for each substituent in the question, I need to determine whether they are activating or deactivating, and whether they are ortho/para or meta directors.

Let me list out the substituents and their directing effects:

1) С6H5-CH3: The substituent is a methyl group. Methyl is an activating group because it's an alkyl group. It's an ortho/para director. So, when bromine is added, the major product would be para.

Wait, no. Wait, in the case of toluene (methylbenzene), the methyl group is activating (because it's an electron-donating group via induction and resonance), so it directs incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions. So, for toluene, bromination would give more para product than ortho, but both are possible.

2) C6H5-COOC2H5: The substituent is an ethyl ester, O-CO-OEt. Wait, the group is -COOEt (ester). So, the substituent is a carbonyl group attached to an ester. Wait, more accurately, the structure is O=C-O-R where R is ethyl. So, the group is an ester, which is an electron-withdrawing group. So, it's a deactivating group.

Wait, but how about the directing effect? Esters are meta directors because the electron-withdrawing groups deactivate the ring and direct meta.

So for 2, which is an ester group, the bromine will add in meta positions. So the major product would be meta, but wait, if the substituent is para, then the meta would be the substituent's adjacent? Wait, no, the substituent is in the benzene ring, so the incoming electrophile adds either in ortho, meta, or para relative to the substituent.

Now, for each substituent:

3) C6H5-Cl: The substituent is Cl. As I thought earlier, Cl is a deactivating group (due to inductive effect) but is an ortho/para director because of its lone pairs. So, the bromine would add in ortho and para positions relative to Cl. But because Cl is deactivating, the ring is less reactive, but the position depends on directing.

4) C6H5-NO2: The substituent is nitro group. Nitro is a strong deactivating group (due to both inductive and resonance effects). It's a meta director. So, the bromine adds in the meta position.

5) C6H5-C2H5: This is ethyl benzene. The substituent is ethyl, which is an activating group (electron-donating via induction and resonance). So, it's an ortho/para director. So, bromine adds either ortho or para.

6) C6H5-COOH: The substituent is carboxylic acid group (-COOH). Carboxylic acid is a strong deactivating group (electron-withdrawing via resonance and induction). So, it's a meta director. Wait, but wait, wait. No, wait, wait. The -COOH group is meta directing. So, the bromine will add in the meta position relative to the COOH group.

Wait, but wait. For each substituent, when the substituent is a strong deactivating group (like nitro, COOH, ester, etc.), the ring is less reactive, so the reaction may be slower. But in this question, we're looking at the position of bromine substitution rather than the reactivity of the ring.

So, for each substituent:

1. Methyl (CH3): activating, ortho/para director. So, when bromine is added, possible positions are ortho and para. But since the ring is activated, the reaction is more favorable.

Wait, but wait. When a substituent is an ortho/para director, the major product is usually para because the steric hindrance in the ortho position is less than in some other cases, but for more substituted rings, the para is often the major product.

But wait, for substituents like methyl, the para product is favored because the ortho positions are more hindered, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, sometimes para is more favored because of lower steric hindrance.

Wait, but in the case of substituents that are ortho/para directors, the product distribution depends on whether the substituent is ortho-directing or para. Wait, no, all ortho/para directors can form both ortho and para products, but the ratio depends on the substituent.

Wait, perhaps for substituents that are strongly activating, the para product is major, because the steric factors make the ortho less favored. For example, in toluene, bromination gives a mixture, but the para isomer is more abundant than the ortho because of less steric hindrance.

But the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, for each substituent, we need to predict the percentage of para product.

Wait, but in some cases, like when the substituent is a strong deactivating group (meta director), the para product would be minimal, but if the substituent is an activating ortho/para director, the para product would be a larger fraction.

Wait, but let's go through each substituent.

1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene): methyl is activating, ortho/para director. So, bromine can add in ortho or para. The major product is para. So, the para fraction would be higher than for meta directors. So the weight fraction of para isomer would be high.

2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl benzoate): the substituent is an ester group (-COOEt), which is deactivating and meta director. So, bromine adds in meta positions. So, the para product would be minimal. Wait, no. Because the substituent is in one position, the bromine can add in meta relative to it. So, for each substituent, the possible bromine positions are relative. Wait, but in this case, the substituent is a meta director, so the major product is meta, which would have the bromine in the meta position relative to the substituent. So, the para product is not formed. Wait, but wait, in the case of a substituent that is meta-directing, the para product is possible but not major.

Wait, I might be confusing. Let me think again. For a meta-directing group, the incoming electrophile goes to the meta positions relative to the substituent. So, if the substituent is in position 1, the electrophile adds in positions 3 and 5 (meta positions). The para position is position 4, which is not a meta position. So, the para product isn't a major product. So, the weight fraction of para is low for this substituent.

3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene): Cl is deactivating (electron-withdrawing) but ortho/para director. So, the bromine can add in ortho (2 and 6 if substituent is in 1) or para (4). But due to the deactivating effect, the reaction might be slower, but the substituent still directs to ortho and para. So, the para product would be a significant fraction of the products. So, the para's weight fraction is higher.

4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene): NO2 is a strong deactivating group and a meta director. So, the bromine adds in the meta position. Thus, the para product is not formed as the major product. So, the weight fraction of para is low.

5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethyl benzene): substituent is ethyl, which is activating (electron-donating) and ortho/para director. So, bromine adds in ortho and para. So, para product is major, similar to toluene. So, the para's weight fraction is high.

6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid): substituent is -COOH, which is deactivating (electron-withdrawing via resonance and inductive effect) and a meta director. So, bromine adds in meta positions. So, the para product is not major. So, the weight fraction of para is low.

Now, the question is to arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, which substances have the lowest para yield, and which have the highest.

Let me list each substance's substituent and the expected para fraction:

1. CH3: para is major. So, higher para fraction.

2. COOEt: meta director, so para is minor. So, low para fraction.

3. Cl: ortho/para director, so para is a major product.

4. NO2: meta director, so para is minor.

5. C2H5: ortho/para, so para major.

6. COOH: meta director, para minor.

Now, among these, which have the lowest para fraction? Those with meta directors: 2,4,6.

Wait, but wait: some substituents might have more than one possible position, but for meta directors, the para product is possible but not major.

Wait, but I'm trying to find the weight fraction of the para isomer. So, for substituents that are meta directors, the para is not a major product, so the fraction is low. For substituents that are ortho/para directors, the para is a major product, so the fraction is high.

So, the order from lowest to highest para fraction would be:

The substituents that are meta directors (2,4,6) have lower para fractions, and the ortho/para directors (1,3,5) have higher.

Within the meta directors, which substituents would have the lowest para fraction? Well, perhaps the substituent's directing effect strength. But wait, all meta directors have the same effect in that the para product is minor.

Wait, but perhaps for some substituents, even though they're meta directors, the para product may form a little, but not as much as for others. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the activating groups (like methyl and ethyl) are ortho/para directors, but the deactivating groups (like nitro, ester, COOH, Cl) are either meta or ortho/para.

Wait, for Cl, it's a deactivating group but ortho/para director. So, the para product is a major product. But for the meta directors, their para product is minor.

So, the substances:

1: CH3 (ortho/para) → high para.

2: COOEt (meta) → low para.

3: Cl (ortho/para) → high para.

4: NO2 (meta) → low para.

5: C2H5 (ortho/para) → high para.

6: COOH (meta) → low para.

Now, I think the para fractions go as follows:

The substituents that are meta directors (2,4,6) have lower para fractions than those that are ortho/para directors (1,3,5). So, the order of increasing para fraction would be: the meta directors first, followed by the ortho/para directors.

But the question asks for the order of increasing weight fraction of para isomer, so the substances with the lowest para fractions come first, and those with higher come later.

So, the meta directors (2,4,6) have lower para fractions, and ortho/para have higher.

But wait, are all meta directors equally low? Let's think: perhaps some substituents are more deactivating, making the para product even less likely? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the activating groups (ortho/para directors) have higher para fractions, and deactivating (meta) have lower.

Wait, but for the substituents that are ortho/para directors, whether they are activating or deactivating may influence the reaction's rate, but the question is about the product distribution, not the reaction rate.

But wait, no. The substituent's strength as an activating/deactivating group affects the ring's reactivity, but the bromination's regiochemistry (where it adds) depends more on the directing effect.

Wait, so perhaps the para fraction is higher for substituents that are ortho/para directors, regardless of whether they're activating or deactivating.

Wait, for example:

Substituent Cl is deactivating but ortho/para director. So, para is a major product.

Substituent NO2 is deactivating and meta director. So, para is minor.

Substituent COOH is deactivating and meta director. So, para is minor.

So, the order of the para fractions is:

Substances 2,4,6 have low para fractions (since they are meta directors). Substances 1,3,5 have higher para fractions (since they are ortho/para directors).

So, the order of increasing para fraction is:

Substances with low para (2,4,6) followed by high para (1,3,5).

But the options given are:

Option A: 4<2<6<3<1<5

Option B: 6<2<4<5<1<3

Option C:4<6<2<1<5<3

Option D:3<5<1<6<2<4

Wait, but perhaps the substituents' directing effects and their activating or deactivating nature may influence the para fraction's magnitude.

Wait, perhaps for substituents that are ortho/para directors, the para isomer is major because of less steric hindrance, while for those that are ortho/para directors but more bulky, the ortho isomer might be less favored, making para the major.

Wait, but perhaps the para fraction is higher for substituents that are ortho/para directors, and lower for meta directors.

So, the substances with substituents 2,4,6 would have lower para fractions, and 1,3,5 higher.

But how to arrange 2,4,6 among themselves? Let's see.

Substituent 2: COOEt (ester group). Deactivating, meta director.

Substituent 4: NO2. Strong deactivating, meta director.

Substituent 6: COOH. Strong deactivating, meta director.

I think that the para fractions for 2,4,6 are lower than those for 1,3,5.

But how do 2,4,6 compare among themselves?

Well, maybe the substituent's strength as a deactivator might influence the reactivity of the ring, but the product distribution (para fraction) is more about the directing effect.

Wait, but perhaps substituents that are stronger deactivators (like NO2) may lead to less para product than weaker deactivators (like COOEt or COOH). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the strength of the deactivating doesn't directly affect the position, just the reaction rate. So, the para fraction would be the same regardless of how strong the deactivator is.

In that case, all meta directors (2,4,6) have the same (low) para fraction, but I don't think that's correct. Because the substituent's nature could influence the possibility of para-substitution.

Wait, another approach: for each substituent, what is the major product?

1: methyl (toluene) → bromobenzene is major in para.

2: ethyl benzoate → major product is meta-bromo.

3: chlorobenzene → major product is para-bromo.

4: nitrobenzene → major product is meta-bromo.

5: ethyl benzene → major product is para-bromo.

6: benzoic acid → major product is meta-bromo.

So, the para fractions are:

1: high

2: low

3: high

4: low

5: high

6: low

So, the order of increasing para fractions would be:

First the low para (substances 2,4,6) and then the high (1,3,5).

But how to order 2,4,6?

Hmm, perhaps it's based on the substituent's ability to direct. But wait, all three are meta directors, so the para fraction is low. So perhaps they are arranged based on other factors. But the question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer, which is low for all three.

Wait, maybe the substituent's ability to activate the ring affects the para fraction. For example, if a substituent is a strong deactivator, the ring is less reactive, but the position is decided by the substituent.

Wait, but the substituent's reactivity affects the reaction rate, not the product distribution. So, for substituents with stronger deactivating effects, the reaction might be slower, but the product distribution (ortho, meta, para) is dictated by the substituent's directing effect.

So, perhaps the para fractions for 2,4,6 are the same, but that's probably not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's ability to direct can influence the ratio of products.

Wait, another angle: the substituent's ability to donate or withdraw electrons can influence the possibility of para substitution. But for meta directors, the para product is not the major.

Wait, maybe in some cases, even with meta directors, some para product is formed, but it's minor.

But the question is about the weight fraction, so for meta directors, the para fraction is low. For ortho/para directors, the para is high.

So, the order of increasing para fraction would be:

Substances with meta directors (2,4,6) come first, followed by ortho/para directors (1,3,5).

Now, among the meta directors, perhaps the substituents that are more deactivating have lower para fractions. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent's ability to deactivates the ring doesn't affect the para fraction as much as their directing.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Let me think about each substituent's para fraction:

Subst 1: CH3 → para fraction is high (let's say 60% or more).

Subst 2: COOEt → para fraction is low (maybe 15%).

Subst 3: Cl → para fraction is high (maybe 70%).

Subst 4: NO2 → para fraction is low (maybe 10%).

Subst 5: C2H5 → para fraction is high (maybe 65%).

Subst 6: COOH → para fraction is low (maybe 20%).

If that's the case, then the order from lowest to highest para fraction is:

4 (10%) < 2 (15%) < 6 (20%) < 1 (60%) <3 (70%) <5 (65%). Wait, no, that would be 4<2<6<1<5<3.

But let me arrange them:

Lowest para fraction first: 4 (NO2, 10%), then 2 (COOEt, 15%), then 6 (COOH, 20%), then 1 (CH3, 60%), 5 (C2H5, 65%), and 3 (Cl,70%).

Wait, but that would make the order 4 < 2 < 6 < 1 <5 <3.

Looking at the options:

Option A:4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5 → No, because 1 comes after 3 in our assumption.

Option B:6 <2 <4 <5 <1 <3 → No.

Option C:4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3 → No, since in our case, 2 is after 4 and before 6.

Option D:3 <5 <1 <6 <2 <4 → No.

Hmm, none of the options match exactly. So perhaps my assumption about the para fractions is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the substituents that are more deactivating (like NO2) might have lower para fractions than those that are less deactivating.

Wait, but for meta directors, the para fraction is low regardless of the substituent's strength. So, perhaps for substituents 2,4,6, the para fraction is low, but the order of their para fractions is based on how much they direct.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's electronic effect doesn't influence the para fraction directly, so their para fractions are the same, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the activating and deactivating effect.

Wait, activating groups (like methyl and ethyl) are ortho/para directors, so their para fractions are higher.

Deactivating groups can be meta directors (like NO2, COOEt, COOH) or ortho/para (like Cl).

For Cl, which is a deactivating but ortho/para director, the para fraction is higher than for meta directors.

So, the order of para fractions is:

Subst 4 (NO2, meta) < subst 2 (COOEt, meta) < subst 6 (COOH, meta) < subst 1 (CH3, ortho/para) < subst 3 (Cl, ortho/para) < subst 5 (C2H5, ortho/para).

Wait, but why would NO2 be lower than COOEt? Because NO2 is a stronger deactivator than COOEt? Hmm, maybe the strength of deactivation affects the reactivity, but not the product distribution. So, perhaps the order of para fraction for meta directors is the same.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about steric effects. For example, substituents like COOH might be more bulky, perhaps leading to more para product than others. But wait, no, because they are meta directors.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach.

The weight fraction of the para-isomer is influenced by the substituent directing. For ortho/para directors, the para product is higher in yield; for meta directors, it's lower.

So, the order would be: meta directors (substs 2,4,6) have lower para fractions, and ortho/para directors (1,3,5) have higher.

Now, to arrange the meta directors among themselves. Which of them has the lowest, then next, etc.

But I'm not sure. Another approach: maybe the presence of strong electron-withdrawing groups reduces the possibility of para substitution. So, the substituent with the strongest deactivating effect might have the lowest para fraction.

In that case, nitro group (NO2) is the strongest deactivator, then COOH, then ester (COOEt).

So, the order among meta directors would be: NO2 (4) < COOH (6) < COOEt (2).

So, the entire order from lowest to highest para fraction is:

4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3.

So, subst 4 (NO2) has the lowest para fraction, then subst6 (COOH), then subst2 (COOEt), then subst1 (CH3), subst5 (C2H5), and subst3 (Cl) with the highest.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option C is 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3. Which matches this order.

So, the correct option is C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer for the given substances undergoing electrophilic substitution with bromine, we analyze the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring. Substituents can either be activating or deactivating and direct incoming electrophiles to ortho, meta, or para positions.

### Substituent Analysis:
1. **C6H5-CH3 (Methyl group)**:  
   - Activating group (electron-donating via induction and resonance).  
   - Ortho/para director.  
   - Para product is major due to reduced steric hindrance compared to ortho.

2. **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ester group -COOEt)**:  
   - Deactivating group (electron-withdrawing via resonance and inductive effects).  
   - Meta director.  
   - Para product is minor.

3. **C6H5-Cl (Chlorine atom)**:  
   - Deactivating group (electron-withdrawing via inductive effect).  
   - Ortho/para director (due to lone pairs on Cl).  
   - Para product is major.

4. **C6H5-NO2 (Nitro group)**:  
   - Strongly deactivating group (electron-withdrawing via resonance and inductive effects).  
   - Meta director.  
   - Para product is minor.

5. **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethyl group)**:  
   - Activating group (electron-donating via induction and resonance).  
   - Ortho/para director.  
   - Para product is major.

6. **C6H5-COOH (Carboxylic acid group -COOH)**:  
   - Strongly deactivating group (electron-withdrawing via resonance and inductive effects).  
   - Meta director.  
   - Para product is minor.

### Order of Increasing Para Fraction:
- Substances with **meta-directing groups** (2, 4, 6) have low para fractions because the para product is not favored.  
- Substances with **ortho/para-directing groups** (1, 3, 5) have high para fractions because the para product is major.  
- Among the meta-directing groups, the strength of deactivation (and thus the relative paucity of para products) increases in the order: **COOEt (2) < COOH (6) < NO2 (4)**.  
- Among the ortho/para-directing groups, the para fraction is generally high, but slight differences arise due to steric and electronic effects. The order is **CH3 (1) < C2H5 (5) < Cl (3)**.

### Final Order:
From lowest to highest para fraction:  
**4 (NO2) < 6 (COOH) < 2 (COOEt) < 1 (CH3) < 5 (C2H5) < 3 (Cl)**.

### Correct Option:
**C) 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**

Answer: C
