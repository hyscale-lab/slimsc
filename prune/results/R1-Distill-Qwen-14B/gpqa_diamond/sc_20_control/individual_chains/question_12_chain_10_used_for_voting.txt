Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles when a pion decays. The reaction is Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu. Oh wait, and the pion is stationary. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. I remember that in particle physics, when a particle decays, energy and momentum are conserved. But since the pion is at rest, the momentum should be conserved in a certain way.

Wait, so the pion is Pi(+) which decays into a muon and a neutrino. Neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass, right? So in this case, the neutrino's rest mass is negligible compared to the others. So the muon must carry away most of the momentum. But I'm a bit confused about how to approach this.

I think I should start by considering conservation of energy and momentum. Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. So the total momentum after decay must also be zero. That means the momentum of the muon and the neutrino must be equal and opposite. But since the neutrino's mass is negligible, its energy is approximately equal to its momentum (because E = pc for massless particles). 

Wait, but the muon does have rest mass. So the energy and momentum of the muon and neutrino must add up in a way that their vector sum is zero. Let me think about the energies.

The initial energy is just the rest mass of the pion, since it's stationary. So E_initial = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV. After decay, the energy is the sum of the muon's energy and the neutrino's energy. But the neutrino's energy is just its momentum (times c, but I'll probably work in units where c=1, so E_nu = p_nu).

So, E_initial = E_mu + E_nu. But E_mu is the total energy of the muon, which is gamma * m_mu c². Hmm, but maybe I can approach this using conservation of energy and momentum with some equations.

Let me denote the momentum of the muon as p. Since the neutrino has equal and opposite momentum, its momentum is -p. But since the neutrino's mass is negligible, E_nu = |p| c. Again, in units where c=1, E_nu = p.

The muon's energy is E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) / c². Wait, that's E_mu = sqrt( p² c^4 + m_mu² c^4 ) / c²? No, wait, units can get confusing. Maybe it's better to set c=1, so E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ), where m_mu is in MeV/c², but since we're using c=1, it's just MeV units.

So E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + (105.7)^2 ). The neutrino's energy is p.

So the energy conservation equation is: m_pi = E_mu + E_nu = sqrt( p^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p.

And the momentum must add up to zero: since the pion is stationary, the vectors must cancel. So p_mu = p, and p_nu = -p, but since neutrino's momentum is opposite, the magnitudes are the same. So the sum of their momenta is zero.

So now I have one equation: 139.6 = sqrt( p^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p.

Hmm, this looks like an equation in terms of p that I can solve. Let me rearrange it. Let me call sqrt(p^2 + 105.7^2) as A. So 139.6 = A + p. Let me subtract p from both sides: A = 139.6 - p. Then, square both sides: A² = (139.6 - p)^2.

But A is sqrt(p² + 105.7²), so A² is p² + (105.7)^2. So:

p² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.

Expanding the right-hand side: (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 p + p².

So, substitute:

p² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 p + p².

Subtract p² from both sides:

105.7² = 139.6² - 2*139.6 p.

Let me compute the numbers. 105.7 squared is approximately 105.7 * 105.7. Let me calculate that: 100^2 is 10000, 5.7^2 is about 32.49, and cross terms are 2*100*5.7=1140. So 10000 + 1140 +32.49= 11172.49. So 105.7² ≈ 11,172.49.

139.6 squared: let me compute 140^2=19600. But 139.6 is 0.4 less than 140. So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

So plugging in:

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2*139.6 p.

Rearrange to solve for p:

2*139.6 p = 19488.16 - 11172.49.

Compute 19488.16 minus 11172.49:

19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

So 2*139.6 p = 8315.67.

Compute 2 * 139.6 = 279.2.

So p = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let me compute that. 8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

Hmm, 279.2 * 29 = approx 8096.8 (since 279.2 *30=8376, which is higher). Let's see:

279.2 * 29.7 = 279.2 * (30 - 0.3) = 8376 - 83.76 = 8292.24.

Our numerator is 8315.67, which is 8315.67 - 8292.24 = 23.43 higher.

So 23.43 / 279.2 ≈ 0.0839, so p ≈ 29.7 + 0.0839 ≈ 29.7839. Let's say approximately 29.78 MeV/c.

So p ≈ 29.78 MeV/c.

So now, the muon's energy E_mu is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 ).

Compute 29.78^2: approx 886.8 (because 30^2 is 900, so 29.78 is just a bit less, maybe around 886.8).

Compute 105.7^2: 11,172.49 as before.

So E_mu = sqrt(886.8 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12059.29) ≈ sqrt(12059) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

Wait, but earlier I have that 139.6 = E_mu + p. So E_mu should be 139.6 - p. Since p is 29.78, E_mu is 139.6 -29.78 = 109.82 MeV. Which matches with the calculation above.

Now, the kinetic energy of the muon is E_mu - m_mu c². Since we're using c=1, and m_mu is 105.7 MeV/c², so m_mu c² is 105.7 MeV.

So KE_muon = 109.82 - 105.7 = 4.12 MeV.

The neutrino's energy is p, as we said earlier. So E_nu = 29.78 MeV. Since the neutrino is massless, its kinetic energy is equal to its energy, which is 29.78 MeV. Wait, but looking at the options, they have two KEs. So the product particles are mu(+) and nu. So the KE of the muon is 4.12 MeV, and the KE of the neutrino is 29.78 MeV, which is approximately 29.8 MeV. So looking at the options, option D is 4.12 and 29.8. So that would be the correct option.

Wait, let me double-check my math because sometimes when I do these calculations, I might make a miscalculation. Let me go back.

Wait, the pion's rest mass is 139.6 MeV/c², muon is 105.7 MeV/c². So the initial energy is 139.6 MeV. The muon's kinetic energy is the energy above its rest mass. So if E_mu is 109.82 MeV, then KE_mu is 109.82 -105.7=4.12 MeV. That's correct.

The neutrino's KE is its entire energy, which is p =29.78, which is about 29.8 MeV. So the KEs are 4.12 and 29.8, which is option D.

To solve the problem, we use conservation of energy and momentum. The pion (Pi⁺) is stationary, so its total initial momentum is zero. After the decay, the muon (μ⁺) and neutrino (ν) must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. Since the neutrino's mass is negligible, its energy is approximately equal to its momentum.

### Conservation of Energy
The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the pion:
\[
E_{\text{initial}} = m_{\pi} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
After decay, the total energy is the sum of the muon's total energy and the neutrino's energy:
\[
E_{\text{initial}} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu}.
\]
The muon's total energy is given by:
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2},
\]
where \(p\) is the magnitude of the muon's momentum, and \(m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\) is the muon's rest mass. The neutrino's energy is equal to its momentum (\(E_{\nu} = p\)).

Thus, the energy conservation equation becomes:
\[
139.6 = \sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} + p.
\]

### Solving for \(p\)
Rearranging the equation:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} = 139.6 - p.
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
p^2 + 105.7^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.
\]
Expanding the right-hand side:
\[
p^2 + 105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2(139.6)p + p^2.
\]
Canceling \(p^2\) from both sides:
\[
105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2(139.6)p.
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2(139.6)p.
\]
Solving for \(p\):
\[
2(139.6)p = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67,
\]
\[
p = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV/c}.
\]

### Energy of the Muon
The muon's total energy is:
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = \sqrt{29.78^2 + 105.7^2}.
\]
Calculating \(29.78^2 \approx 886.8\) and \(105.7^2 \approx 11172.49\):
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{886.8 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.29} \approx 109.82 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Kinetic Energy of the Muon
The muon's kinetic energy is:
\[
KE_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu}c^2 = 109.82 - 105.7 = 4.12 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Neutrino's Energy
The neutrino's energy is equal to its momentum:
\[
E_{\nu} = p \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
Since the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, its kinetic energy is equal to its energy:
\[
KE_{\nu} = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(29.8 \, \text{MeV}\), respectively. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles when a pion decays. The reaction is Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu. Oh wait, and the pion is stationary. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV.

But the neutrino's energy is just its momentum (times c, but I'll probably work in units where c=1, so E_nu = p_nu).

So, E_initial = E_mu + E_nu. But E_mu is the total energy of the muon, which is gamma * m_mu c². Hmm, but maybe I can approach this using conservation of energy and momentum with some equations.

Let me denote the momentum of the muon as p. Since the neutrino has equal and opposite momentum, its momentum is -p. But since the neutrino's mass is negligible, E_nu = |p| c. Again, in units where c=1, E_nu = p.

The muon's energy is E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) / c². Wait, that's E_mu = sqrt( p² c^4 + m_mu² c^4 ) / c²? No, wait, units can get confusing. Maybe it's better to set c=1, so E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ), where m_mu is in MeV/c², but since we're using c=1, it's just MeV units.

So E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + (105.7)^2 ). The neutrino's energy is p.

So the energy conservation equation is: m_pi = E_mu + E_nu = sqrt( p^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p.

And the momentum must add up to zero: since the pion is stationary, the vectors must cancel. So p_mu = p, and p_nu = -p, but since neutrino's momentum is opposite, the magnitudes are the same. So the sum of their momenta is zero.

So now I have one equation: 139.6 = sqrt( p^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p.

Hmm, this looks like an equation in terms of p that I can solve. Let me rearrange it. Let me call sqrt(p^2 + 105.7^2) as A. So 139.6 = A + p. Let me subtract p from both sides: A = 139.6 - p. Then, square both sides: A² = (139.6 - p)^2.

But A is sqrt(p² + 105.7²), so A² is p² + (105.7)^2. So:

p² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.

Expanding the right-hand side: (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 p + p².

So, substitute:

p² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 p + p².

Subtract p² from both sides:

105.7² = 139.6² - 2*139.6 p.

Let me compute the numbers. 105.7 squared is approximately 105.7 * 105.7. Let me calculate that: 100^2 is 10000, 5.7^2 is about 32.49, and cross terms are 2*100*5.7=1140. So 10000 + 1140 +32.49= 11172.49. So 105.7² ≈ 11,172.49.

139.6 squared: let me compute 140^2=19600. But 139.6 is 0.4 less than 140. So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

So plugging in:

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2*139.6 p.

Rearrange to solve for p:

2*139.6 p = 19488.16 - 11172.49.

Compute 19488.16 minus 11172.49:

19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

So 2*139.6 p = 8315.67.

Compute 2 * 139.6 = 279.2.

So p = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let me compute that. 8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

Hmm, 279.2 * 29 = approx 8096.8 (since 279.2 *30=8376, which is higher). Let's see:

279.2 * 29.7 = 279.2 * (30 - 0.3) = 8376 - 83.76 = 8292.24.

Our numerator is 8315.67, which is 8315.67 - 8292.24 = 23.43 higher.

So 23.43 / 279.2 ≈ 0.0839, so p ≈ 29.7 + 0.0839 ≈ 29.7839. Let's say approximately 29.78 MeV/c.

So p ≈ 29.78 MeV/c.

So now, the muon's energy E_mu is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 ).

Compute 29.78^2: approx 886.8 (because 30^2 is 900, so 29.78 is just a bit less, maybe around 886.8).

Compute 105.7^2: 11,172.49 as before.

So E_mu = sqrt(886.8 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12059.29) ≈ sqrt(12059) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

Wait, but earlier I have that 139.6 = E_mu + p. So E_mu should be 139.6 - p. Since p is 29.78, E_mu is 139.6 -29.78 = 109.82 MeV. Which matches with the calculation above.

Now, the kinetic energy of the muon is E_mu - m_mu c². Since we're using c=1, and m_mu is 105.7 MeV/c², so m_mu c² is 105.7 MeV.

So KE_muon = 109.82 - 105.7 = 4.12 MeV.

The neutrino's energy is p, as we said earlier. So E_nu = 29.78 MeV. Since the neutrino is massless, its kinetic energy is equal to its energy, which is 29.78 MeV. Wait, but looking at the options, they have two KEs. So the product particles are mu(+) and nu. So the KE of the muon is 4.12 MeV, and the KE of the neutrino is 29.78 MeV, which is approximately 29.8 MeV. So looking at the options, option D is 4.12 and 29.8. So that would be the correct option.

Wait, let me double-check my math because sometimes when I do these calculations, I might make a miscalculation. Let me go back.

Wait, the pion's rest mass is 139.6 MeV/c², muon is 105.7 MeV/c². So the initial energy is 139.6 MeV. The muon's kinetic energy is the energy above its rest mass. So if E_mu is 109.82 MeV, then KE_mu is 109.82 -105.7=4.12 MeV. That's correct.

The neutrino's KE is its entire energy, which is p =29.78, which is about 29.8 MeV. So the KEs are 4.12 and 29.8, which is option D.


To solve the problem, we use conservation of energy and momentum. The pion (Pi⁺) is stationary, so its total initial momentum is zero. After the decay, the muon (μ⁺) and neutrino (ν) must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. Since the neutrino's mass is negligible, its energy is approximately equal to its momentum.

### Conservation of Energy
The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the pion:
\[
E_{\text{initial}} = m_{\pi} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
After decay, the total energy is the sum of the muon's total energy and the neutrino's energy:
\[
E_{\text{initial}} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu}.
\]
The muon's total energy is given by:
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2},
\]
where \(p\) is the magnitude of the muon's momentum, and \(m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\) is the muon's rest mass. The neutrino's energy is equal to its momentum (\(E_{\nu} = p\)).

Thus, the energy conservation equation becomes:
\[
139.6 = \sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} + p.
\]

### Solving for \(p\)
Rearranging the equation:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} = 139.6 - p.
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
p^2 + 105.7^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.
\]
Expanding the right-hand side:
\[
p^2 + 105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2(139.6)p + p^2.
\]
Canceling \(p^2\) from both sides:
\[
105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2(139.6)p.
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2(139.6)p.
\]
Solving for \(p\):
\[
2(139.6)p = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67,
\]
\[
p = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV/c}.
\]

### Energy of the Muon
The muon's total energy is:
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = \sqrt{29.78^2 + 105.7^2}.
\]
Calculating \(29.78^2 \approx 886.8\) and \(105.7^2 \approx 11172.49\):
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{886.8 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.29} \approx 109.82 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Kinetic Energy of the Muon
The muon's kinetic energy is:
\[
KE_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu}c^2 = 109.82 - 105.7 = 4.12 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Neutrino's Energy
The neutrino's energy is equal to its momentum:
\[
E_{\nu} = p \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
Since the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, its kinetic energy is equal to its energy:
\[
KE_{\nu} = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(29.8 \, \text{MeV}\), respectively. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
