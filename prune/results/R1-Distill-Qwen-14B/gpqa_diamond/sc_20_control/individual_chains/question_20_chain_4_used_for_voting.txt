Okay, so I've got this question about nuclear physics and approximations made in many-body calculations. Hmm, let me think. The question is about the impulse approximation in nuclear interactions. I remember that in this approximation, nucleons are treated as if they're free, meaning their motion is not significantly affected by the rest of the nucleus. 

The question is asking which four assumptions jointly imply this impulse approximation. The options are combinations of statements 1,2,3,4.

First, I need to understand each statement.

Statement 1: The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons. So the interaction doesn't involve any collective effects, like the whole nucleus moving together. If the current only acts on one nucleon at a time, that suggests each nucleon is treated independently, which fits with the idea of free particles because they don't influence each other much.

Statement 2: The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon. Wait, transparent meaning that the interaction doesn't see the rest of the nucleus. So if the nucleus is transparent except for one nucleon, that implies that when a particle interacts with the nucleus, it only interacts with one nucleon and the others don't affect it. That sounds like the impulse approximation where the other nucleons are considered as a spectator. So this assumption is part of the impulse model.

Statement 3: The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic. Hmm, not sure about this. Quarks being non-relativistic would mean they move at speeds much less than light. So maybe this is about the internal structure of the nucleon. If the quarks are non-relativistic, perhaps the binding between quarks (like in the nucleus) is weak or treated simply. But how does that tie into the impulse approximation? Well, the impulse approximation is about the motion of nucleons, not their internal structure. So maybe this statement is not directly related to the impulse approximation but more about how the nucleon itself behaves. Wait, but the question is about which assumptions imply that nucleons behave as free particles. So perhaps if the quarks are non-relativistic, their binding is such that they're tightly bound and don't transfer much energy—maybe that's a separate consideration. I'm a bit confused here. Maybe this statement isn't directly one of the main assumptions for the impulse approximation.

Statement 4: The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces. Oh, wait, that makes sense. If during the interaction, the nucleon is treated as if it's not bound, it can move freely. So in other words, the binding forces from the nucleus are ignored. So the nucleon behaves as a free particle because it's not affected by the surrounding nucleons' forces. That definitely implies the impulse approximation because the binding is neglected.

So putting it together, the impulse approximation is when each nucleon is treated as free, so the perturbation (like a photon or something) interacts with a single nucleon, and the rest of the nucleus doesn't affect it much. So the assumptions that lead to this are when each interaction is with individual nucleons (1), the nucleus is transparent except for that nucleon (2), and the interaction ignores binding forces (4). 

What about statement 3? It's about quarks being non-relativistic. I don't think that's directly part of the impulse approximation assumptions. The impulse approximation is more about the nucleus's response, not the internal structure of the nucleons. So statement 3 might not be necessary for the impulse approximation—maybe it's a different assumption, perhaps related to how the nucleon's internal quarks behave but not directly to the approximation that nucleons are free in the nucleus.

So the assumptions needed are 1,2, and 4. Looking at the options:

Option A) 1,2,4 → matches.
Option B) 2,3,4 → includes 3 which we don't need.
Option C)1,2,3 → includes 3, no.
Option D)1,3,4 → includes 3.

So the correct option should be A.

The impulse approximation in nuclear physics assumes that nucleons behave as free particles, unaffected by the rest of the nucleus during an interaction. To determine which assumptions jointly imply this approximation, let us analyze the given statements:

1. **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons**: This assumption implies that the interaction is treated as a series of independent events involving single nucleons, rather than collective effects. This aligns with the impulse approximation, where nucleons are treated as free and independent.

2. **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon**: This means that the interaction is primarily with one nucleon, and the rest of the nucleus is considered transparent or irrelevant. This is a key assumption of the impulse approximation, as it neglects the influence of the surrounding nucleons.

3. **The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic**: This statement pertains to the internal structure of the nucleon and its quarks. While important for understanding nucleon behavior, it is not directly related to the impulse approximation, which focuses on the motion and interaction of nucleons as free particles within the nucleus.

4. **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces**: This assumption neglects the binding forces between the nucleon and the nucleus, treating the nucleon as a free particle. This is a direct implication of the impulse approximation.

From this analysis, the assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are **1, 2, and 4**. Statement **3** is not directly relevant to the impulse approximation, as it concerns the internal quark dynamics rather than the treatment of nucleons as free particles.

**Option A (1, 2, 4)** correctly represents the assumptions that imply the impulse approximation.

Answer: A
