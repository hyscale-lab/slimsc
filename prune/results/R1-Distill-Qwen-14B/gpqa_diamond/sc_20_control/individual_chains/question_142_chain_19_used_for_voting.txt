Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and where it's located geometrically in the qubits space. Hmm, right.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed, meaning it's a statistical mixture of pure states. But wait, what does this particular matrix look like?

Let me write it out in matrix form. The standard basis states |0⟩ and |1⟩ are represented as column vectors. So |0⟩ is [1; 0] and |1⟩ is [0; 1]. So |0⟩⟨0| would be a matrix with 1 in the top-left corner and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| is 1 in the bottom-right and zeros elsewhere. Adding them together would give a matrix with 1s on the diagonal and 0s off-diagonal. But wait, that's the identity matrix, right? So the sum is I, the 2x2 identity matrix.

But then ρ is (1/2) times that sum. So ρ = (1/2)I. So the matrix would be [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. That makes sense.

Now, the question is about its geometrical position in the qubit space. I remember that qubit states can be visualized on the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a way to represent all possible states of a qubit, both pure and mixed. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside.

Wait, but the density matrix for a mixed state can be represented as a point in the Bloch sphere as well. The representation involves expressing the density matrix in terms of the Pauli matrices. Oh right, any 2x2 density matrix can be written as ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector (like (x, y, z)) and σ are the Pauli matrices.

So let's see, our ρ is (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| ), which is (I)/2. Comparing this to the general form, (I + r·σ)/2, that implies that r·σ must be zero. Because adding zero to I/2 would give us ρ as it is.

If r·σ is zero, then each component of r must be zero. Because the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, and their dot product with r would be r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z. For this to be zero, each term must be zero. So r_x, r_y, r_z are all zero. So r is (0,0,0).

Therefore, the point is at the origin. Wait, but the Bloch sphere has the origin as the completely mixed state between |0⟩ and |1⟩. Because any state on the surface is pure, and the origin is the maximally mixed state, which has equal probability of 0 and 1, which is exactly what ρ is here.

So looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0), which would be the origin. So the answer should be option C.

But wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing things up. The density matrix ρ is (I)/2, which is a completely mixed state. On the Bloch sphere, the pure states are on the surface, and the completely mixed state is at the center, which is (0,0,0). So yes, that makes sense.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is that the density matrix for a completely mixed state has no coherence and equal probabilities, so it's the center point. So yeah, the answer is option C.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

In matrix form, this is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{2} & 0 \\ 0 & \frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This represents a completely mixed state, which is an equal probability mixture of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\). Geometrically, the Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states, where pure states lie on the surface and mixed states lie inside. The general form of a density matrix on the Bloch sphere is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is a vector that determines the position of the state in the Bloch sphere. For the given \(\rho\), we have:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} I,
\]

which implies that \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\). This means that all components of \(\mathbf{r}\) are zero, so \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\). This corresponds to the origin of the Bloch sphere, which represents the completely mixed state with equal probabilities for \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\).

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in the qubit space is at the origin, \(r = (0, 0, 0)\).
