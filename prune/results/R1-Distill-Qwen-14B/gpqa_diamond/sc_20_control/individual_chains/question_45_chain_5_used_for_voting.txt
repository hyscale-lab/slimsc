Okay, so I have this physics problem about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The question is asking for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. Hmm, I remember that in such a well, the energy levels are quantized based on the particle's quantum number.

Wait, each particle is spin-1/2, so they are fermions, right? Because electrons are spin-1/2 and they obey the Pauli exclusion principle. So, the Pauli principle says that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state in the same system. That means each particle must have a unique set of quantum numbers.

The particles are in a 1D infinite well, so the energy levels are given by E_n = (n² π² ħ²) / (2mL²). Oh, and the problem statement says E is defined as π² ħ²/(2mL²), so E_n is n² E. So each energy level is an integer squared times E.

Now, since there are four particles, each with spin-1/2, each can have two possible spin states (up or down). So, for each spatial quantum state (which is determined by n), you can have two particles with opposite spins.

In a 1D box, the quantum state is determined by the principal quantum number n, which is a positive integer (n=1,2,3,...). So for each n, there are two possible spin states. That means each n can hold up to two particles.

So the four particles will fill up the lowest possible energy levels with the lowest n's possible, considering the Pauli exclusion.

Let me think about the ground state first. Ground state is the lowest energy, so particles will fill up the lowest n's.

n=1 can hold two particles (since spin up and down). Similarly, n=2 can hold two more. So with four particles, the two lowest n's, each with two particles. So particles are in n=1 and n=2, each with two. So the total energy is 2*(1² E) + 2*(2² E) = 2E + 8E = 10E? Wait, no. Wait, each n has two particles, each contributing E_n. So total energy is sum over each particle's energy.

Wait, the ground state would have two particles in n=1 and two in n=2. So each of the four particles contributes their respective E_n.

Wait, no, wait. Each state (n and spin) can hold one particle. So for each n, you can have two particles (since spin up and down are two different states). So the first two particles go into n=1, each with opposite spins. The next two go into n=2, each with opposite spins. So the energies would be 1² E and 2² E for each group.

So the total energy for the ground state would be 2*(1² E) + 2*(2² E) = 2E + 8E = 10E. Hmm, but wait, let me think again. Each particle in n=1 contributes E, so two particles give 2E. Each in n=2 contributes 4E, so two give 8E. Total 10E.

So ground state energy is 10E.

Wait, but wait another thing. I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of the particles as fermions, so each must have a unique (n, spin) state. So the first two particles go into n=1, spin up and down. The next two go into n=2, spin up and down. So each n has two particles. So the total energy is 2*(1^2 E) + 2*(2^2 E) = 2E + 8E = 10E. So the ground state is 10E.

But wait, in the options, option B has 4E as the ground state. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps each particle in n=1 contributes E, and there are two of them, so 2E. Then n=2: two particles, each with 4E, so 8E. 2E +8E=10E.

But in the options, option C has 4E, 10E, 15E. Option B has 4E as the first energy. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up something else.

Wait, maybe each particle's energy is E multiplied by n^2, and they are all identical particles. So the ground state should be the lowest possible configuration. Wait, but I have four particles. So for four particles in a 1D box with spin-1/2, each state (n, spin) can hold one particle.

So the first two go into n=1, spin up and down. The next two go into n=2, spin up and down. So the energy is 2*(1² E) + 2*(2² E) = 2E + 8E = 10E. So the ground state is 10E.

Wait, but option B says 4E as ground state, which is much lower. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe I made a mistake in how I'm counting the particles.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing the fact that in a 1D box, the particles are in individual states, but maybe I'm miscounting. Let me think: each n can have two particles (with spin up and down). So for four particles, the first two go into n=1, and the next two go into n=2.

So that's n=1 and n=2 each have two particles. So the energies are 1² E and 2² E. So the total energy would be 2*(1² E + 2² E) = 2*(1 +4) E = 10E. So the ground state is 10E.

But looking at the options, option B has ground state as 4E, and option C starts at 4E. Hmm, but according to that, my calculation says the ground state is 10E, which is in option B and C as the first excited or higher.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Are the particles being treated as distinguishable or indistinguishable? No, they are identical fermions, so they must obey the exclusion principle.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up the calculation. Let me approach this differently. The possible quantum states for each particle are (n, m_s), where m_s is ±1/2 for spin up and down.

Each state can hold exactly one fermion. So for four fermions, we need four unique states.

So the first four states are (n=1, m_s= +1/2), (n=1, m_s= -1/2), (n=2, m_s=+1/2), (n=2, m_s=-1/2). So, yes, two particles in n=1 and two in n=2. So the total energy is 2*(E) + 2*(4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.

So ground state is 10E.

But wait, the options say option B: 4E, 10E, 50E. So ground state is 10E, but in the options, the options for the ground state in B is 4E. So that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not in the ground state, but the first and second excited states.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to order the states based on the sum of the individual energies, and the ground state is the lowest sum. But perhaps the way the particles are arranged affects the total energy.

Wait, what if the particles are arranged differently? Let me think about what the possible states are.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in how I'm counting the particles. Let me try to write down the possible states and their energies.

Possible n for each particle can be 1,2,3,...

Each particle can be in n=1,2,3,... and spin up or down.

So for four particles, the first two particles (lowest energy) go into n=1, spin up and down.

The next two go into n=2, spin up and down.

So the total energy is 2*(1² E) + 2*(2² E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.

So the ground state is 10E.

Then the first excited state would be the next possible arrangement. Because in the ground state, all the lowest possible states are filled.

So, perhaps the first excited state would be when one of the particles in n=2 moves to a higher n, but I'm not sure.

Wait, wait. In a system of identical particles, the state with the next higher energy would be when one particle is excited to the next available state. But since all the lower states are filled, perhaps the first excited state would have one particle promoted to n=3.

Wait, but how does that affect the total energy? Let me think.

In the ground state, all four particles are in n=1 and n=2.

In the first excited state, perhaps one of the n=2 particles would move to n=3, but that would require a higher energy. But wait, if the particles are fermions, moving a particle to a higher state might require other particles to adjust.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, but given the Pauli exclusion, we have to see if that's possible.

Wait, but no, because in the ground state, all the lower states are filled. So when you have four particles, the first two are in n=1, then the next two in n=2. The next available state would be n=3, but since n=3 has two available spin states, you can add a particle there.

Wait, but wait, in the ground state, all four are already filled in n=1 and n=2. So to get the first excited state, perhaps the configuration is different. Let me think of the total energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the system can have other configurations with the same number of particles but higher energy. For example, maybe having one particle in n=3 and another in n=4, but that would require their spin states.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck on this. Maybe I should approach the question by considering the possible total energies.

The options given are:

A) 30E, 39E, 50E

B)4E, 10E,50E

C)4E,10E,15E

D)10E,15E,18E

Wait, but according to my earlier calculation, the ground state is 10E. So which option has the ground state as 10E? Looking at the options, option B and D have 10E as either ground or other states.

Wait, option B says ground state is 4E, which seems too low. Hmmm. So perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the individual energies with the total. Oh wait, no, the question asks for the energies of the system as a whole. So the total energy is the sum of the energies of the individual particles.

Wait, perhaps I'm thinking of the system as having each particle in a state, but perhaps the way the particles are arranged in energy levels changes the total.

Wait, another approach: For four particles in a 1D box with spin-1/2, the ground state is when all are in the lowest possible states.

So for four particles, the first two go into n=1 (each with opposite spins), the next two go into n=2 (opposite spins). So the total energy is 2*E + 2*(4E) = 2E +8E =10E.

So the ground state is 10E.

Now, the first excited state would be when one of the particles in n=2 moves to a higher state. But wait, in a system of fermions, the next available state would be n=3. But perhaps moving a particle from n=2 to n=3 would require that the state is unoccupied.

Wait, but in the ground state, all lower n's are filled. So the next available state is n=3, spin up. So to make the first excited state, perhaps we have three particles in n=1 and one in n=3? No, wait, because each n can hold up to two particles. So you can't have three in n=1 because n=1 can hold two.

Alternatively, perhaps in the first excited state, one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, but that would result in three particles: two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. Wait, but each n can have up to two particles, so that's allowed?

Wait, no, because each particle in a higher n would have a higher energy. So the first excited state would have the particles arranged to have the lowest possible higher energy.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, while another remains in n=2. So the configuration would be two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. Let me compute the energy for that.

Energy would be 2*(1E) + 1*(4E) + 1*(9E) = 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Wait, that gives a total of 15E. But wait, is that the first excited state?

Alternatively, maybe the first excited state is when one particle moves to n=3 while another moves to a higher n, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when the highest particle is in n=3, but the count is two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. So the total energy is 2*1E + 1*4E + 1*9E = 2 +4 +9=15E. So the first excited state would be 15E.

Wait, but what about the second excited state? That would probably involve moving another particle from n=2 to n=3, or maybe moving one to n=4.

Wait, if we have two in n=1, two in n=2, that's the ground state. If in the first excited state, we have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3, the energy is 2*1 +1*4 +1*9=15E.

Then, the second excited state could be when another particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, but wait, that would require another particle in n=3, but each n can have two particles. So then we have two in n=1, two in n=3. Let's see.

Wait, no, because each n can have two particles, so n=3 can have two. So the configuration would be two in n=1, zero in n=2 (because the two in n=2 have moved to n=3?), but that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the first excited state has particles in n=1, n=1, n=2, n=3. But then the energy is 2*1 +4 +9 =15E. Then the second excited state could have one in n=4, making the configuration 2,1,1,1. Then energy is 2*1 +4 +9 +16=31E. But that's not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps for the four particles, the first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, and the other n=2 particle remains, but that doesn't make sense because each n can have two. Wait, maybe the first excited state is when two particles are in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3, as I thought before, giving 15E.

Then, the second excited state would have another particle promoted from n=2 to n=3, but that would require two in n=3, so the configuration becomes two in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3. The energy would be 2*1 + 2*9= 2 +18=20E. But that's not in the options.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think again. Perhaps the possible states are arranged in a way where the first excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3, but another is promoted to a higher n, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the energies in terms of the sum of n² for each particle.

The ground state is 1²+1² +2² +2² = 1+1+4+4 =10 → 10E.

The first excited state might be when the highest n is increased by one, so perhaps one of the n=2 becomes n=3. So the sum becomes 1+1+4+9=15 → 15E.

The second excited state would then be when another particle is promoted. So perhaps two particles in n=3. So sum is 1+1+9+9 =20 → 20E. But that's not in the options. Alternatively, maybe the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4: sum is 1+1+4+16=22 → 22E. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the way the particles are arranged is different. Maybe the first excited state is when the particles are in n=1,1,2,3 → sum 1+1+4+9=15E.

Second excited state: n=1,2,2,3 → sum 1+4+4+9=18E.

Wait, that's 18E. So the sequence would be 10E (ground), 15E (first excited), 18E (second excited). But looking at the options, option D says 10E,15E,18E. So that would match.

Wait, but does that configuration allow for that arrangement?

In the first excited state, n=1,1,2,3: two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. That's possible because each n can hold up to two.

Wait, but in that case, the arrangement is allowed. The first excited state would be when one particle is promoted to n=3, making the sum 15E.

The second excited state could be when another particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, so now n=1,1,3,3. The sum is 1+1+9+9=20E.

But that doesn't match any option. Alternatively, maybe the second excited state has one particle in n=4, so sum is 1+1+4+16=22E. Not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when two particles are in n=1, and the other two are in n=3. So sum is 1+1+9+9=20E, but that's higher than 15E, which would be the first excited state.

Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the concepts. Let me think about the possible states in order of increasing energy.

The ground state is 10E as before.

The first excited state would be the next possible energy level. So the minimal increase is moving one particle from n=2 to n=3, which increases the energy by (9-4)E=5E. So the total would be 10E +5E=15E.

The second excited state would be the next possible increase. That could be moving another particle from n=2 to n=3, resulting in sum 20E (but that's not in the options). Or perhaps moving a particle from n=2 to n=4, which would add (16-4)=12E, making 22E. But that's even higher.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4, so the sum is 1+1+4+16=22E.

Alternatively, maybe the second excited state is when we have three particles in n=2 and one in n=3. But that's not possible because each n can have two particles.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's look at the options.

Option D is 10E,15E,18E.

So according to this, the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second 18E.

How would 18E be achieved?

18E would be 18 = 1+1+4+12? No, wait, no. Each n^2 contributes E.

Wait, 18E would mean the sum of the squares is 18. So 1+1+4+12? Hmm, no. Or perhaps 1+4+4+9=18.

Ah, yes! 1+4+4+9=18, which would correspond to two particles in n=1, two particles in n=2, but that's the ground state.

Wait, no, that's the ground state. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps 18 is 1+1+16+0? No. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the sum is 1+4+4+9=18. But that would require two particles in n=2 and two in n=3. So their energies would be 2*(4E) +2*(9E) =8E + 18E=26E. Hmm, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again.

If the first excited state is 15E (sum 15), then what would the second excited state be?

Another possible configuration is having three particles in n=1 and one in n=3.

Wait, but n=1 can only hold two particles. So that's not possible. So no, that's not allowed.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is in n=3, and another in n=4. So sum is 1+1+9+16=27. That's 27E, which is higher than 15E. So that would be a higher energy state than the first excited state.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let me think of the energies in terms of the sum of the individual energies.

The ground state is 10E.

The first excited state would have the next possible minimal energy. That's when one of the particles in n=2 moves to n=3, so the sum increases by 5E. So 10E +5E=15E.

The second excited state would then be when another particle is moved from n=2 to n=3, adding another 5E. So 15E +5E=20E.

But 20E isn't an option. So perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is moved to n=4, which adds 12E, making it 22E. Again, not an option.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is 4E, 10E,50E. Hmm, that seems way off. Option C starts at 4E, which is much lower than 10E.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the ground state. Could the ground state have a lower energy? How?

Wait, if the particles are in the same spin state? No, because they're fermions and can't do that. So the ground state must have each n filled with two particles when possible.

Wait, unless the particles are bosons, but the question states they're spin-1/2, which are fermions.

Maybe I'm making a mistake in the way the particles are filled. Let me think of the possible states again.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the number of particles. There are four particles, each must have a unique (n, spin). So for two particles, n=1 can have two (spin up and down). The next two go into n=2. That's the ground state.

But perhaps the problem is considering each particle's spin as separate, so the way their energies stack is different.

Wait, perhaps the energies for each state are as follows.

Each particle must occupy a unique state. So for four particles, the first two go into n=1, spin up and down. The next two go into n=2, spin up and down. So each has energies E and 4E respectively.

Wait, so each of the four particles contributes E or 4E. So the sum is 2E + 2*(4E) = 10E. So ground state is 10E.

Then, the first excited state would be when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3. So now, the configuration is two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3.

The total energy would be (2*1) + (1*4) + (1*9) = 2 +4 +9 =15E.

The second excited state would be when another n=2 particle moves to n=3, making two in n=3 and two in n=1. So configuration is two in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3.

Energy is (2*1) + (2*9) =2 +18=20E.

But in the options, no option has 20E. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and one in n=4. So the configuration would be two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4.

Sum is 1+1+4+16=22E.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, looking back, option C is 4E,10E,15E. So ground state 4E, first excited 10E, second 15E.

Wait, how could the ground state be 4E? That would mean all four particles are in n=2, but that's impossible because n=2 can hold two particles. So that can't be.

Ah, wait a minute. Maybe I've made a mistake. Each particle's energy is E multiplied by n squared, but perhaps the sum is not the sum of all the individual energies.

Wait, no, the total energy is the sum of each particle's energy.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the particles are not being counted correctly. Let me count again.

In the ground state: two particles in n=1 (each with E), and two in n=2 (each with 4E). So total energy is 2*1 + 2*4 = 2 +8=10E.

In the first excited state: one particle moves from n=2 to n=3. So two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. So energies are 1+1+4+9 =15E.

In the second excited state: another particle moves from n=2 to n=3, making two in n=3, two in n=1. So energies are 1+1+9+9=20E.

But none of the options have 20E.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4. So configuration is two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4. Sum is 1+1+4+16=22E.

But again, not matching options.

Wait, looking back at the options, option D is 10E,15E,18E. So ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E.

How can the second excited state be 18E?

Wait, 18E would require a sum of 18. So let's see: 1+4+4+9=18. So that would require two particles in n=1 (wait no, n=1 can only have two particles, but their n is 1). Wait, no, 1+4+4+9=18. So that would be one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3.

Wait, but each n can take two particles. So n=2 can take two, n=3 can take two. So this configuration is allowed.

So the configuration for 18E would be:

n=1: one particle (E=1E)

n=2: two particles (each 4E)

n=3: one particle (9E)

So total energy is 1 +4+4 +9 =18E.

But wait, why would this be higher than 15E?

Because in the first excited state, the configuration is two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3, which sums to 15E.

So the next higher energy would be 18E, which is when one particle is in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3.

Wait, but that would require that the system is in a higher energy state than 15E, which it is (18E>15E).

So perhaps the order is:

Ground state: 10E → two in n=1, two in n=2.

First excited state: 15E → two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3.

Second excited state: 18E → one in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3.

So the energies are 10E,15E,18E, which is option D.

So the correct answer must be option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we analyze the system as follows:

### Key Concepts:
1. **Energy Levels in a 1D Infinite Potential Well**:  
   The energy levels are quantized and given by:  
   \[
   E_n = n^2 E \quad \text{where } E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2}.
   \]
   Each energy level \( n \) can accommodate two particles due to the two possible spin states (\( \pm \frac{1}{2} \)).

2. **Pauli Exclusion Principle**:  
   Since the particles are fermions, no two particles can occupy the same quantum state. Thus, each \( n \) can hold at most two particles (one for each spin state).

3. **Ground State Configuration**:  
   In the ground state, the particles occupy the lowest available energy levels. For four particles, this corresponds to two particles in \( n=1 \) and two particles in \( n=2 \). The total energy is:  
   \[
   E_{\text{ground}} = 2E_1 + 2E_2 = 2(1^2 E) + 2(2^2 E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.
   \]

4. **First Excited State Configuration**:  
   In the first excited state, one particle is promoted from \( n=2 \) to \( n=3 \), while the remaining particles remain in \( n=1 \) and \( n=2 \). The configuration is two particles in \( n=1 \), one particle in \( n=2 \), and one particle in \( n=3 \). The total energy is:  
   \[
   E_{\text{first excited}} = 2E_1 + E_2 + E_3 = 2(1^2 E) + 1(2^2 E) + 1(3^2 E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.
   \]

5. **Second Excited State Configuration**:  
   In the second excited state, another particle is promoted from \( n=2 \) to \( n=3 \), resulting in one particle in \( n=1 \), two particles in \( n=2 \), and one particle in \( n=3 \). The total energy is:  
   \[
   E_{\text{second excited}} = E_1 + 2E_2 + E_3 = 1(1^2 E) + 2(2^2 E) + 1(3^2 E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.
   \]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (30E, 39E, 50E)**: These values are much higher than the calculated energies and do not match the expected sequence.  
- **Option B (4E, 10E, 50E)**: The ground state energy of 4E is incorrect, as the ground state energy is calculated to be \( 10E \).  
- **Option C (4E, 10E, 15E)**: The ground state energy of 4E is incorrect, as the ground state energy is \( 10E \).  
- **Option D (10E, 15E, 18E)**: This matches the calculated energies for the ground state (\( 10E \)), first excited state (\( 15E \)), and second excited state (\( 18E \)).

### Conclusion:
The correct sequence of energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state is \( 10E, 15E, 18E \), which corresponds to **Option D**.

Answer: D

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this physics problem about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The question is asking for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. Hmm, I remember that in such a well, the energy levels are quantized based on the particle's quantum number.

Wait, each particle is spin-1/2, so they are fermions, right? Because electrons are spin-1/2 and they obey the Pauli exclusion principle. So, the Pauli principle says that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state in the same system. That means each particle must have a unique set of quantum numbers.

The particles are in a 1D infinite well, so the energy levels are given by E_n = (n² π² ħ²) / (2mL²). Oh, and the problem statement says E is defined as π² ħ²/(2mL²), so E_n is n² E. So each energy level is an integer squared times E.

Now, since there are four particles, each with spin-1/2, each can have two possible spin states (up or down). So, for each spatial quantum state (which is determined by n), you can have two particles with opposite spins.

In a 1D box, the quantum state is determined by the principal quantum number n, which is a positive integer (n=1,2,3,...). So for each n, there are two possible spin states. That means each n can hold up to two particles.

So the four particles will fill up the lowest possible energy levels with the lowest n's possible, considering the Pauli exclusion.

Let me think about the ground state first. Ground state is the lowest energy, so particles will fill up the lowest n's.

n=1 can hold two particles (since spin up and down). Similarly, n=2 can hold two more. So with four particles, the two lowest n's, each with two particles. So particles are in n=1 and n=2, each with two. So the total energy is 2*(1² E) + 2*(2² E) = 2E + 8E = 10E? Wait, no. Wait, each n has two particles, each contributing E_n. So total energy is sum over each particle's energy.

Wait, the ground state would have two particles in n=1 and two in n=2. So each of the four particles contributes their respective E_n.

Wait, no, wait. Each state (n and spin) can hold one particle. So for each n, you can have two particles (since spin up and down are two different states). So the first two particles go into n=1, each with opposite spins. The next two go into n=2, each with opposite spins. So the energies would be 1² E and 2² E for each group.

So the total energy for the ground state would be 2*(1² E) + 2*(2² E) = 2E + 8E = 10E. Hmm, but wait, let me think again. Each particle in n=1 contributes E, so two particles give 2E. Each in n=2 contributes 4E, so two give 8E. Total 10E.

So ground state energy is 10E.

Wait, but wait another thing. I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of the particles as fermions, so each must have a unique (n, spin) state. So the first two particles go into n=1, spin up and down. The next two go into n=2, spin up and down. So each n has two particles. So the total energy is 2*(1^2 E) + 2*(2^2 E) = 2E + 8E = 10E. So the ground state is 10E.

But wait, in the options, option B has 4E as the ground state. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps each particle in n=1 contributes E, and there are two of them, so 2E. Then n=2: two particles, each with 4E, so 8E. 2E +8E=10E.

But in the options, option C has 4E, 10E, 15E. Option B has 4E as the first energy. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up something else.

Wait, maybe each particle's energy is E multiplied by n^2, and they are all identical particles. So the ground state should be the lowest possible configuration. Wait, but I have four particles. So for four particles in a 1D box with spin-1/2, each state (n, spin) can hold one particle.

So the first two go into n=1, spin up and down. The next two go into n=2, spin up and down. So the energy is 2*(1² E) + 2*(2² E) = 2E + 8E = 10E. So the ground state is 10E.

Wait, but option B says 4E as ground state, which is much lower. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe I made a mistake in how I'm counting the particles.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing the fact that in a 1D box, the particles are in individual states, but maybe I'm miscounting. Let me think: each n can have two particles (with spin up and down). So for four particles, the first two go into n=1, and the next two go into n=2.

So that's n=1 and n=2 each have two particles. So the energies are 1² E and 2² E. So the total energy would be 2*(1² E + 2² E) = 2*(1 +4) E = 10E. So the ground state is 10E.

But looking at the options, option B has ground state as 4E, and option C starts at 4E. Hmm, but according to that, my calculation says the ground state is 10E, which is in option B and C as the first excited or higher.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Are the particles being treated as distinguishable or indistinguishable? No, they are identical fermions, so they must obey the exclusion principle.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up the calculation. Let me approach this differently. The possible quantum states for each particle are (n, m_s), where m_s is ±1/2 for spin up and down.

Each state can hold exactly one fermion. So for four fermions, we need four unique states.

So the first four states are (n=1, m_s= +1/2), (n=1, m_s= -1/2), (n=2, m_s=+1/2), (n=2, m_s=-1/2). So, yes, two particles in n=1 and two in n=2. So the total energy is 2*(E) + 2*(4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.

So ground state is 10E.

But wait, the options say option B: 4E, 10E, 50E. So ground state is 10E, but in the options, the options for the ground state in B is 4E. So that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not in the ground state, but the first and second excited states.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to order the states based on the sum of the individual energies, and the ground state is the lowest sum. But perhaps the way the particles are arranged affects the total energy.

Wait, what if the particles are arranged differently? Let me think about what the possible states are.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in how I'm counting the particles. Let me try to write down the possible states and their energies.

Possible n for each particle can be 1,2,3,...

Each particle can be in n=1,2,3,... and spin up or down.

So for four particles, the first two particles (lowest energy) go into n=1, spin up and down.

The next two go into n=2, spin up and down.

So the total energy is 2*(1² E) + 2*(2² E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.

So the ground state is 10E.

Then the first excited state would be the next possible arrangement. Because in the ground state, all the lowest possible states are filled.

So, perhaps the first excited state would be when one of the particles in n=2 moves to a higher n, but I'm not sure.

Wait, wait. In a system of identical particles, the state with the next higher energy would be when one particle is excited to the next available state. But since all the lower states are filled, perhaps the first excited state would have one particle promoted to n=3.

Wait, but how does that affect the total energy? Let me think.

In the ground state, all four particles are in n=1 and n=2.

In the first excited state, perhaps one of the n=2 particles would move to n=3, but that would require a higher energy. But wait, if the particles are fermions, moving a particle to a higher state might require other particles to adjust.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, but given the Pauli exclusion, we have to see if that's possible.

Wait, but no, because in the ground state, all the lower states are filled. So when you have four particles, the first two are in n=1, then the next two in n=2. The next available state would be n=3, but since n=3 has two available spin states, you can add a particle there.

Wait, but wait, in the ground state, all four are already filled in n=1 and n=2. So to get the first excited state, perhaps the configuration is different. Let me think of the total energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the system can have other configurations with the same number of particles but higher energy. For example, maybe having one particle in n=3 and another in n=4, but that would require their spin states.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck on this. Maybe I should approach the question by considering the possible total energies.

The options given are:

A) 30E, 39E, 50E

B)4E, 10E,50E

C)4E,10E,15E

D)10E,15E,18E

Wait, but according to my earlier calculation, the ground state is 10E. So which option has the ground state as 10E? Looking at the options, option B and D have 10E as either ground or other states.

Wait, option B says ground state is 4E, which seems too low. Hmmm. So perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the individual energies with the total. Oh wait, no, the question asks for the energies of the system as a whole. So the total energy is the sum of the energies of the individual particles.

Wait, perhaps I'm thinking of the system as having each particle in a state, but perhaps the way the particles are arranged in energy levels changes the total.

Wait, another approach: For four particles in a 1D box with spin-1/2, the ground state is when all are in the lowest possible states.

So for four particles, the first two go into n=1 (each with opposite spins), the next two go into n=2 (opposite spins). So the total energy is 2*E + 2*(4E) = 2E +8E =10E.

So the ground state is 10E.

Now, the first excited state would be when one of the particles in n=2 moves to a higher state. But wait, in a system of fermions, the next available state would be n=3. But perhaps moving a particle from n=2 to n=3 would require that the state is unoccupied.

Wait, but in the ground state, all lower n's are filled. So the next available state is n=3, spin up. So to make the first excited state, perhaps we have three particles in n=1 and one in n=3? No, wait, because each n can hold up to two particles. So you can't have three in n=1 because n=1 can hold two.

Alternatively, perhaps in the first excited state, one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, but that would result in three particles: two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. Wait, but each n can have up to two particles, so that's allowed?

Wait, no, because each particle in a higher n would have a higher energy. So the first excited state would have the particles arranged to have the lowest possible higher energy.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, while another remains in n=2. So the configuration would be two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. Let me compute the energy for that.

Energy would be 2*(1E) + 1*(4E) + 1*(9E) = 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Wait, that gives a total of 15E. But wait, is that the first excited state?

Alternatively, maybe the first excited state is when one particle moves to n=3 while another moves to a higher n, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when the highest particle is in n=3, but the count is two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. So the total energy is 2*1E + 1*4E + 1*9E = 2 +4 +9=15E. So the first excited state would be 15E.

Wait, but what about the second excited state? That would probably involve moving another particle from n=2 to n=3, or maybe moving one to n=4.

Wait, if we have two in n=1, two in n=2, that's the ground state. If in the first excited state, we have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3, the energy is 2*1 +1*4 +1*9=15E.

Then, the second excited state could be when another particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, but wait, that would require another particle in n=3, but each n can have two particles. So then we have two in n=1, two in n=3. Let's see.

Wait, no, because each n can have two particles, so n=3 can have two. So the configuration would be two in n=1, zero in n=2 (because the two in n=2 have moved to n=3?), but that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the first excited state has particles in n=1, n=1, n=2, n=3. But then the energy is 2*1 +4 +9 =15E. Then the second excited state could have one in n=4, making the configuration 2,1,1,1. Then energy is 2*1 +4 +9 +16=31E. But that's not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps for the four particles, the first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, and the other n=2 particle remains, but that doesn't make sense because each n can have two. Wait, maybe the first excited state is when two particles are in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3, as I thought before, giving 15E.

Then, the second excited state would have another particle promoted from n=2 to n=3, but that would require two in n=3, so the configuration becomes two in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3. The energy would be 2*1 + 2*9= 2 +18=20E. But that's not in the options.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think again. Perhaps the possible states are arranged in a way where the first excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3, but another is promoted to a higher n, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the energies in terms of the sum of n² for each particle.

The ground state is 1²+1² +2² +2² = 1+1+4+4 =10 → 10E.

The first excited state might be when the highest n is increased by one, so perhaps one of the n=2 becomes n=3. So the sum becomes 1+1+4+9=15 → 15E.

The second excited state would then be when another particle is promoted. So perhaps two particles in n=3. So sum is 1+1+9+9 =20 → 20E. But that's not in the options. Alternatively, maybe the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4: sum is 1+1+4+16=22 → 22E. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the way the particles are arranged is different. Maybe the first excited state is when the particles are in n=1,1,2,3 → sum 1+1+4+9=15E.

Second excited state: n=1,2,2,3 → sum 1+4+4+9=18E.

Wait, that's 18E. So the sequence would be 10E (ground), 15E (first excited), 18E (second excited). But looking at the options, option D says 10E,15E,18E. So that would match.

Wait, but does that configuration allow for that arrangement?

In the first excited state, n=1,1,2,3: two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. That's possible because each n can hold up to two.

Wait, but in that case, the arrangement is allowed. The first excited state would be when one particle is promoted to n=3, making the sum 15E.

The second excited state could be when another particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, so now n=1,1,3,3. The sum is 1+1+9+9=20E.

But that doesn't match any option. Alternatively, maybe the second excited state has one particle in n=4, so sum is 1+1+4+16=22E. Not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when two particles are in n=1, and the other two are in n=3. So sum is 1+1+9+9=20E, but that's higher than 15E, which would be the first excited state.

Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the concepts. Let me think about the possible states in order of increasing energy.

The ground state is 10E as before.

The first excited state would be the next possible energy level. So the minimal increase is moving one particle from n=2 to n=3, which increases the energy by (9-4)E=5E. So the total would be 10E +5E=15E.

The second excited state would be the next possible increase. That could be moving another particle from n=2 to n=3, resulting in sum 20E (but that's not in the options). Or perhaps moving a particle from n=2 to n=4, which would add (16-4)=12E, making 22E. But that's even higher.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4, so the sum is 1+1+4+16=22E.

Alternatively, maybe the second excited state is when we have three particles in n=2 and one in n=3. But that's not possible because each n can have two particles.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's look at the options.

Option D is 10E,15E,18E.

So according to this, the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second 18E.

How would 18E be achieved?

18E would be 18 = 1+1+4+12? No, wait, no. Each n^2 contributes E.

Wait, 18E would mean the sum of the squares is 18. So 1+1+4+12? Hmm, no. Or perhaps 1+4+4+9=18.

Ah, yes! 1+4+4+9=18, which would correspond to two particles in n=1, two particles in n=2, but that's the ground state.

Wait, no, that's the ground state. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps 18 is 1+1+16+0? No. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the sum is 1+4+4+9=18. But that would require two particles in n=2 and two in n=3. So their energies would be 2*(4E) +2*(9E) =8E + 18E=26E. Hmm, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again.

If the first excited state is 15E (sum 15), then what would the second excited state be?

Another possible configuration is having three particles in n=1 and one in n=3.

Wait, but n=1 can only hold two particles. So that's not possible. So no, that's not allowed.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is in n=3, and another in n=4. So sum is 1+1+9+16=27. That's 27E, which is higher than 15E. So that would be a higher energy state than the first excited state.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let me think of the energies in terms of the sum of the individual energies.

The ground state is 10E.

The first excited state would have the next possible minimal energy. That's when one of the particles in n=2 moves to n=3, so the sum increases by 5E. So 10E +5E=15E.

The second excited state would then be when another particle is moved from n=2 to n=3, adding another 5E. So 15E +5E=20E.

But 20E isn't an option. So perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is moved to n=4, which adds 12E, making it 22E. Again, not an option.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is 4E, 10E,50E. Hmm, that seems way off. Option C starts at 4E, which is much lower than 10E.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the ground state. Could the ground state have a lower energy? How?

Wait, if the particles are in the same spin state? No, because they're fermions and can't do that. So the ground state must have each n filled with two particles when possible.

Wait, unless the particles are bosons, but the question states they're spin-1/2, which are fermions.

Maybe I'm making a mistake in the way the particles are filled. Let me think of the possible states again.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the number of particles. There are four particles, each must have a unique (n, spin). So for two particles, n=1 can have two (spin up and down). The next two go into n=2. That's the ground state.

But perhaps the problem is considering each particle's spin as separate, so the way their energies stack is different.

Wait, perhaps the energies for each state are as follows.

Each particle must occupy a unique state. So for four particles, the first two go into n=1, spin up and down. The next two go into n=2, spin up and down. So each has energies E and 4E respectively.

Wait, so each of the four particles contributes E or 4E. So the sum is 2E + 2*(4E) = 10E. So ground state is 10E.

Then, the first excited state would be when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3. So now, the configuration is two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3.

The total energy would be (2*1) + (1*4) + (1*9) = 2 +4 +9 =15E.

The second excited state would be when another n=2 particle moves to n=3, making two in n=3 and two in n=1. So configuration is two in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3.

Energy is (2*1) + (2*9) =2 +18=20E.

But in the options, no option has 20E. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and one in n=4. So the configuration would be two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4.

Sum is 1+1+4+16=22E.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, looking back, option C is 4E,10E,15E. So ground state 4E, first excited 10E, second 15E.

Wait, how could the ground state be 4E? That would mean all four particles are in n=2, but that's impossible because n=2 can hold two particles. So that can't be.

Ah, wait a minute. Maybe I've made a mistake. Each particle's energy is E multiplied by n squared, but perhaps the sum is not the sum of all the individual energies.

Wait, no, the total energy is the sum of each particle's energy.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the particles are not being counted correctly. Let me count again.

In the ground state: two particles in n=1 (each with E), and two in n=2 (each with 4E). So total energy is 2*1 + 2*4 = 2 +8=10E.

In the first excited state: one particle moves from n=2 to n=3. So two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. So energies are 1+1+4+9 =15E.

In the second excited state: another particle moves from n=2 to n=3, making two in n=3, two in n=1. So energies are 1+1+9+9=20E.

But none of the options have 20E.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4. So configuration is two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4. Sum is 1+1+4+16=22E.

But again, not matching options.

Wait, looking back at the options, option D is 10E,15E,18E. So ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E.

How can the second excited state be 18E?

Wait, 18E would require a sum of 18. So let's see: 1+4+4+9=18. So that would require two particles in n=1 (wait no, n=1 can only have two particles, but their n is 1). Wait, no, 1+4+4+9=18. So that would be one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3.

Wait, but each n can take two particles. So n=2 can take two, n=3 can take two. So this configuration is allowed.

So the configuration for 18E would be:

n=1: one particle (E=1E)

n=2: two particles (each 4E)

n=3: one particle (9E)

So total energy is 1 +4+4 +9 =18E.

But wait, why would this be higher than 15E?

Because in the first excited state, the configuration is two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3, which sums to 15E.

So the next higher energy would be 18E, which is when one particle is in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3.

Wait, but that would require that the system is in a higher energy state than 15E, which it is (18E>15E).

So perhaps the order is:

Ground state: 10E → two in n=1, two in n=2.

First excited state: 15E → two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3.

Second excited state: 18E → one in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3.

So the energies are 10E,15E,18E, which is option D.

So the correct answer must be option D.


To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we analyze the system as follows:

### Key Concepts:
1. **Energy Levels in a 1D Infinite Potential Well**:  
   The energy levels are quantized and given by:  
   \[
   E_n = n^2 E \quad \text{where } E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2}.
   \]
   Each energy level \( n \) can accommodate two particles due to the two possible spin states (\( \pm \frac{1}{2} \)).

2. **Pauli Exclusion Principle**:  
   Since the particles are fermions, no two particles can occupy the same quantum state. Thus, each \( n \) can hold at most two particles (one for each spin state).

3. **Ground State Configuration**:  
   In the ground state, the particles occupy the lowest available energy levels. For four particles, this corresponds to two particles in \( n=1 \) and two particles in \( n=2 \). The total energy is:  
   \[
   E_{\text{ground}} = 2E_1 + 2E_2 = 2(1^2 E) + 2(2^2 E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.
   \]

4. **First Excited State Configuration**:  
   In the first excited state, one particle is promoted from \( n=2 \) to \( n=3 \), while the remaining particles remain in \( n=1 \) and \( n=2 \). The configuration is two particles in \( n=1 \), one particle in \( n=2 \), and one particle in \( n=3 \). The total energy is:  
   \[
   E_{\text{first excited}} = 2E_1 + E_2 + E_3 = 2(1^2 E) + 1(2^2 E) + 1(3^2 E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.
   \]

5. **Second Excited State Configuration**:  
   In the second excited state, another particle is promoted from \( n=2 \) to \( n=3 \), resulting in one particle in \( n=1 \), two particles in \( n=2 \), and one particle in \( n=3 \). The total energy is:  
   \[
   E_{\text{second excited}} = E_1 + 2E_2 + E_3 = 1(1^2 E) + 2(2^2 E) + 1(3^2 E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.
   \]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (30E, 39E, 50E)**: These values are much higher than the calculated energies and do not match the expected sequence.  
- **Option B (4E, 10E, 50E)**: The ground state energy of 4E is incorrect, as the ground state energy is calculated to be \( 10E \).  
- **Option C (4E, 10E, 15E)**: The ground state energy of 4E is incorrect, as the ground state energy is \( 10E \).  
- **Option D (10E, 15E, 18E)**: This matches the calculated energies for the ground state (\( 10E \)), first excited state (\( 15E \)), and second excited state (\( 18E \)).

### Conclusion:
The correct sequence of energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state is \( 10E, 15E, 18E \), which corresponds to **Option D**.

Answer: D
