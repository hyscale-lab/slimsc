Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on a few factors like the star's temperature, the planet's distance from the star, and its albedo. Oh wait, the question says both planets have the same albedo, so that part won't matter here.

The star's mass is 1.5 times the Sun, radius is 1.2 times, and Teff is 6300 K. The planets have masses of 7 and 5 Earth masses, but wait, the mass probably isn't directly relevant for equilibrium temperature. Oh, but maybe the orbital period is? Because the RV method is about the Doppler shift, which depends on the planet's mass and orbital period.

So the key here is to find the distance of each planet from the star. Because equilibrium temperature formula is T_planet = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.25. Oh wait, actually the formula is T = T_star * ( R_star / (2a) )^0.5 * ( (1 - A) /4 )^0.25. But since albedo is same for both, that part cancels out.

But first, how do I find the orbital distance 'a' for each planet? The radial velocity method gives the Doppler shift, which relates to the velocity of the star due to the planet. The RV method measures the star's velocity towards and away from us, which depends on the planet's mass and the orbital period.

Wait, but the data given is the shift in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å. For Planet1, the shift is up to 0.03 Å, and for Planet2, it's 0.04 Å. Oh right, the Doppler shift is related to the velocity of the star. The formula for Doppler shift (Δλ/λ) is v/c, where v is the velocity. But wait, the shift here is in Ångströms. So for a wavelength λ of 6300 Å, a shift of 0.03 Å is a delta λ. So delta λ = v * λ / c. So v = (delta λ) * c / λ.

But I think more accurately, the radial velocity (v) can be calculated from the shift. The formula is v = (Δλ / λ) * c. So for each planet, the maximum Doppler shift corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity.

So for Planet1: delta λ = 0.03 Å, λ = 6300 Å. So Δλ/λ is 0.03 / 6300 = 3e-6. Then v1 = (3e-6) * c. What's c? Approximately 3e8 m/s. So v1 = 3e-6 * 3e8 = 9e2 m/s? Wait, 3e-6 *3e8 = 9e2? Let me compute that: 3e-6 *3e8 = (3*3) * (1e-6 *1e8) )=9 * 1e2 =900 m/s. Wait, that seems high. Hmm, wait, maybe I'm mixing up the units. Oh wait, 6300 Å is 6300e-10 meters. So the actual calculation:

v = (delta λ) / λ * c. Wait, delta λ is 0.03 Å =0.03e-10 m. Lambda is 6300 Å =6300e-10 m.

So v = (0.03e-10 / 6300e-10 ) * 3e8 m/s.

Simplify: 0.03 /6300 = 3/(630000) = 1/(210000) ≈4.76e-6.

So v≈4.76e-6 *3e8 = approx 1.428e3 m/s. So about 1428 m/s for Planet1.

Similarly for Planet2, delta λ is 0.04 Å. So same calculation: 0.04e-10 /6300e-10 = 0.04/6300 =4/(630000)= 4/(6.3e5)≈6.349e-6.

v2=6.349e-6 *3e8= 1.9047e3 m/s ≈1904.7 m/s.

Wait, but wait, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = ( (2π G) / (P c) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )

But this looks complicated. Alternatively, another formula relates K (the radial velocity semi-amplitude) with the star's velocity, which depends on the planet's mass and the orbital period.

But maybe I can use the fact that K is proportional to (M_planet) / (M_star^(1/3) * (1 + M_planet/M_star)^{1/3}) ) * (1/(a^(1/2)) )

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to relate the velocity semi-amplitude K to the orbital period and the distance.

Wait, another approach: the star's velocity K is related to the planet's orbital speed via K = (V_planet) * (M_planet / M_star) ). Because the planet and star orbit their common center of mass, so their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. So V_star = V_planet * (M_planet / M_star).

But the star's velocity is K, so K = (V_planet) * (M_p/M_s).

And the planet's orbital speed is V_p = (2π a)/P, where a is the semi-major axis (assuming circular orbit, so a is the radius), and P is the orbital period.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I can use the formula that relates the semi-amplitude K with the orbital period and the mass ratio.

Alternatively, I remember that the RV method gives us the velocity semi-amplitude K, which relates to the mass of the planet and the distance.

Wait, from the radial velocity method, the formula for K is K = (v) = ( (G * P) / (2π c²) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_s + M_p)^(2/3) ) )

But that's a bit complicated. Alternatively, considering that both planets orbit the same star, and their albedos are same, I might not need to compute the actual distances but find a ratio.

Wait, the problem is to find the ratio of equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 to Planet2. Equilibrium temperature T_eq is proportional to T_star * sqrt(R_star/(a)).

So, T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (R_star/a1) / (R_star/a2) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 ).

Because T_eq is proportional to sqrt(R_star/(a)), so for two planets it's sqrt(R/(a1)) / sqrt(R/(a2)) )= sqrt(a2/a1).

So I need to find a1 and a2, the semi-major axes of the two planets.

Hmm, so how do I find a1 and a2? Because the RV method gives K, the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, which relates to the planet's mass and the orbital period and distance.

But without knowing the periods, maybe I can relate K to the distance a.

Wait, I think I can use the formula that relates K to the planet's orbital parameters.

The formula for K is:

K = ( (27.4 m/s) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / (M_J) ) * ( (1 + M_p/M_s )^(-2/3) ) * ( (P year)^(-1/3) ) )

But perhaps that's not the easiest way here.

Another approach: the star's velocity K is related to the planet's velocity via the mass ratio.

The star's velocity K = (V_planet) * (M_p / M_s )

But M_p is much less than M_s, so K ≈ V_p * (M_p / M_s )

But V_p is the planet's orbital speed, which is 2π a / P.

Hmm, but without P, the period, I can't relate a and K directly.

Wait, but maybe there's a way to find a in terms of K, M_p, and M_s.

The formula for the semi-amplitude of radial velocity is given by:

K = [ (v) ] = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_s + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P * c)) )^(1/3) ) * ( sin i )

Assuming i=90 degrees (edge-on orbit), so sin i =1.

But perhaps a better approach is to use Kepler's third law. Kepler's law says:

P² = (4π²/G(M_s + M_p)) ) * a^3

Since M_p << M_s, M_s + M_p ≈ M_s, so:

P² = (4π² / (G M_s )) ) * a^3

So P² = (4π² a³ )/(G M_s )

But we can relate P and a.

Wait, but how does K relate to a?

From the radial velocity formula, the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (2π G ) / (c P ) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_s + M_p )^(2/3) ) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_s, M_s + M_p ≈ M_s, so:

K ≈ ( (2π G ) / (c P ) )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( M_s^(2/3) )

But again, sin i is 1 (edge-on), so:

K ≈ ( (2π G )^(1/3) ) / ( c^(1/3) P^(1/3) ) ) * ( M_p ) / ( M_s^(2/3) )

Hmm, perhaps I can cube both sides to get:

K³ = ( (2π G ) / (c³ P ) ) * ( M_p³ ) / ( M_s² )

But this seems a bit complicated. Alternatively, maybe it's better to use the relation between K and a.

Wait, another way: the star's velocity K is related to how much it's being pulled by the planet. The gravitational force makes the star move in a small orbit. The star's velocity can be linked to the planet's velocity.

But perhaps another approach. Since both planets are orbiting the same star, and assuming that the RV method gives K for each, which is proportional to (M_p) / (a²) )^(1/3) or something like that. Alternatively, let's think about the relation between K and a.

Wait, let me think: the star's velocity K is given by the formula K = (v) = (M_p / M_s) * (V_p), where V_p is the planet's orbital speed. And V_p = 2π a / P.

But using Kepler's third law: P² = (4π² a³)/(G M_s )

So V_p = 2π a / P = (2π a ) / ( (4π² a³/(G M_s ) )^(1/2) )

= (2π a) / ( (2π a^(3/2) ) / sqrt(G M_s) ) )

= (2π a * sqrt(G M_s) ) ) / (2 π a^(3/2) ) )

= sqrt( G M_s ) / sqrt( a )

So V_p = sqrt( G M_s / a )

So K = (M_p / M_s) * sqrt( G M_s / a )

= (M_p) / sqrt( M_s a ) ) * sqrt( G )

= M_p * sqrt( G ) / sqrt( M_s a )

Hmm, that's an expression for K in terms of a, M_p, M_s, and G.

So solving for a:

K = M_p * sqrt(G) / sqrt( M_s a )

=> sqrt( M_s a ) = M_p sqrt(G) / K

=> M_s a = ( M_p² G ) / K²

=> a = ( M_p² G ) / ( M_s K² )

So a is proportional to M_p² / (M_s K² )

Wait, so a1 / a2 = ( ( M_p1² / (M_s K1² )) ) / ( ( M_p2² / (M_s K2² )) ) )

= ( M_p1² K2² ) / ( M_p2² K1² )

Because the M_s cancels out.

So a1/a2 = ( (M_p1 / M_p2 )^2 ) * ( K2 / K1 )^2 )

Plugging in the numbers:

M_p1 =7 Earth masses, M_p2=5.

So (7/5)^2 =49/25=1.96.

K1 is 1428 m/s (from earlier calculation), K2 is 1904.7 m/s.

So K2/K1= 1904.7/1428 ≈1.334.

So (K2/K1)^2 ≈ (1.334)^2 ≈1.78.

So a1/a2= 1.96 *1.78 ≈3.50.

Wait, but wait, because a1 is proportional to (M_p1^2 K2^2) / ( M_p2^2 K1^2 ), so a1 = [ (7^2 * K2^2 ) ] / [5^2 * K1^2 ] * a2, but wait, no, because a1/a2 = (7^2 * K2²) / (5^2 * K1^2 )

Wait, let me recheck:

a1/a2 = ( (7^2) * (K2)^2 ) / ( (5^2) * (K1)^2 ) )

So 7²=49, 5²=25.

So 49/25 =1.96.

K2=1904.7, K1=1428.

So K2/K1= 1904.7 /1428 ≈1.334.

So (K2/K1)^2= (1.334)^2 ≈1.78.

So a1/a2=1.96 *1.78 ≈3.50.

Wait, that would mean a1 is about 3.5 times a2, meaning Planet1 is farther from the star than Planet2.

But then, equilibrium temperature depends on sqrt( R_star / a ), so T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Since a1 is 3.5 a2, a2/a1 is 1/3.5≈0.2857.

So sqrt(0.2857)≈0.5345.

So T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈0.5345, which is about 0.53.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.53.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we use the equilibrium temperature formula:

\[
T_{\text{eq}} \propto T_{\text{star}} \sqrt{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a}}
\]

where \(a\) is the orbital distance of the planet from the star. Since both planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures depends only on the ratio of their orbital distances:

\[
\frac{T_{\text{eq,1}}}{T_{\text{eq,2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

To find \(a_1\) and \(a_2\), we use the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV semi-amplitude \(K\) is related to the orbital distance \(a\) by:

\[
a \propto \frac{M_p^2}{K^2}
\]

where \(M_p\) is the planet's mass and \(K\) is the RV semi-amplitude. For two planets, the ratio of their orbital distances is:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{M_p1^2 K_2^2}{M_p2^2 K_1^2}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \(K_1\) and \(K_2\)
The Doppler shift \(\Delta \lambda\) is related to the star's velocity \(v\) by:

\[
v = \frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda} \cdot c
\]

For Planet1 (\(\Delta \lambda = 0.03 \, \text{Å}\), \(\lambda = 6300 \, \text{Å}\)):

\[
K_1 = \frac{0.03}{6300} \cdot 3 \times 10^8 = 1428 \, \text{m/s}
\]

For Planet2 (\(\Delta \lambda = 0.04 \, \text{Å}\), \(\lambda = 6300 \, \text{Å}\)):

\[
K_2 = \frac{0.04}{6300} \cdot 3 \times 10^8 = 1904.7 \, \text{m/s}
\]

### Step 2: Compute the ratio \(a_1 / a_2\)
The masses of the planets are \(M_{p1} = 7 \, M_{\text{Earth}}\) and \(M_{p2} = 5 \, M_{\text{Earth}}\). Substituting into the formula:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{(M_{p1})^2 (K_2)^2}{(M_{p2})^2 (K_1)^2}
\]

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{(7^2) (1904.7^2)}{(5^2) (1428^2)}
\]

First, calculate the mass ratio squared:

\[
\frac{M_{p1}^2}{M_{p2}^2} = \frac{7^2}{5^2} = \frac{49}{25} = 1.96
\]

Next, calculate the velocity ratio squared:

\[
\frac{K_2^2}{K_1^2} = \left(\frac{1904.7}{1428}\right)^2 \approx (1.334)^2 \approx 1.78
\]

Now, combine the results:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = 1.96 \cdot 1.78 \approx 3.5
\]

### Step 3: Compute the equilibrium temperature ratio
The equilibrium temperature ratio is:

\[
\frac{T_{\text{eq,1}}}{T_{\text{eq,2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Since \(a_1 / a_2 = 3.5\), we have:

\[
\frac{T_{\text{eq,1}}}{T_{\text{eq,2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{3.5}} = \sqrt{0.2857} \approx 0.53
\]

### Final Answer:
The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately **0.53**.

Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on a few factors like the star's temperature, the planet's distance from the star, and its albedo. Oh wait, the question says both planets have the same albedo, so that part won't matter here.

The star's mass is 1.5 times the Sun, radius is 1.2 times, and Teff is 6300 K. The planets have masses of 7 and 5 Earth masses, but wait, the mass probably isn't directly relevant for equilibrium temperature. Oh, but maybe the orbital period is? Because the RV method is about the Doppler shift, which depends on the planet's mass and orbital period.

So the key here is to find the distance of each planet from the star. Because equilibrium temperature formula is T_planet = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.25. Oh wait, actually the formula is T = T_star * ( R_star / (2a) )^0.5 * ( (1 - A) /4 )^0.25. But since albedo is same for both, that part cancels out.

But first, how do I find the orbital distance 'a' for each planet? The radial velocity method gives the Doppler shift, which relates to the velocity of the star due to the planet. The RV method measures the star's velocity towards and away from us, which depends on the planet's mass and the orbital period.

Wait, but the data given is the shift in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å. For Planet1, the shift is up to 0.03 Å, and for Planet2, it's 0.04 Å. Oh right, the Doppler shift is related to the velocity of the star. The formula for Doppler shift (Δλ/λ) is v/c, where v is the velocity. But wait, the shift here is in Ångströms. So for a wavelength λ of 6300 Å, a shift of 0.03 Å is a delta λ. So delta λ = v * λ / c. So v = (delta λ) * c / λ.

But I think more accurately, the radial velocity (v) can be calculated from the shift. The formula is v = (Δλ / λ) * c. So for each planet, the maximum Doppler shift corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity.

So for Planet1: delta λ = 0.03 Å, λ = 6300 Å. So Δλ/λ is 0.03 / 6300 = 3e-6. Then v1 = (3e-6) * c. What's c? Approximately 3e8 m/s. So v1 = 3e-6 * 3e8 = 9e2 m/s? Wait, 3e-6 *3e8 = 9e2? Let me compute that: 3e-6 *3e8 = (3*3) * (1e-6 *1e8) )=9 * 1e2 =900 m/s. Wait, that seems high. Hmm, wait, maybe I'm mixing up the units. Oh wait, 6300 Å is 6300e-10 meters. So the actual calculation:

v = (delta λ) / λ * c. Wait, delta λ is 0.03 Å =0.03e-10 m. Lambda is 6300 Å =6300e-10 m.

So v = (0.03e-10 / 6300e-10 ) * 3e8 m/s.

Simplify: 0.03 /6300 = 3/(630000) = 1/(210000) ≈4.76e-6.

So v≈4.76e-6 *3e8 = approx 1.428e3 m/s. So about 1428 m/s for Planet1.

Similarly for Planet2, delta λ is 0.04 Å. So same calculation: 0.04e-10 /6300e-10 = 0.04/6300 =4/(630000)= 4/(6.3e5)≈6.349e-6.

v2=6.349e-6 *3e8= 1.9047e3 m/s ≈1904.7 m/s.

Wait, but wait, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = ( (2π G) / (P c) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )

But this looks complicated. Alternatively, another formula relates K (the radial velocity semi-amplitude) with the star's velocity, which depends on the planet's mass and the orbital period.

But maybe I can use the fact that K is proportional to (M_planet) / (M_star^(1/3) * (1 + M_planet/M_star)^{1/3}) ) * (1/(a^(1/2)) )

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to relate the velocity semi-amplitude K to the orbital period and the distance.

Wait, another approach: the star's velocity K is related to the planet's orbital speed via K = (V_planet) * (M_planet / M_star) ). Because the planet and star orbit their common center of mass, so their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. So V_star = V_planet * (M_planet / M_star).

But the star's velocity is K, so K = (V_planet) * (M_p/M_s).

And the planet's orbital speed is V_p = (2π a)/P, where a is the semi-major axis (assuming circular orbit, so a is the radius), and P is the orbital period.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I can use the formula that relates the semi-amplitude K with the orbital period and the mass ratio.

Alternatively, I remember that the RV method gives us the velocity semi-amplitude K, which relates to the mass of the planet and the distance.

Wait, from the radial velocity method, the formula for K is K = (v) = ( (G * P) / (2π c²) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_s + M_p)^(2/3) ) )

But that's a bit complicated. Alternatively, considering that both planets orbit the same star, and their albedos are same, I might not need to compute the actual distances but find a ratio.

Wait, the problem is to find the ratio of equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 to Planet2. Equilibrium temperature T_eq is proportional to T_star * sqrt(R_star/(a)).

So, T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (R_star/a1) / (R_star/a2) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 ).

Because T_eq is proportional to sqrt(R_star/(a)), so for two planets it's sqrt(R/(a1)) / sqrt(R/(a2)) )= sqrt(a2/a1).

So I need to find a1 and a2, the semi-major axes of the two planets.

Hmm, so how do I find a1 and a2? Because the RV method gives K, the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, which relates to the planet's mass and the orbital period and distance.

But without knowing the periods, maybe I can relate K to the distance a.

Wait, I think I can use the formula that relates K to the planet's orbital parameters.

The formula for K is:

K = ( (27.4 m/s) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / (M_J) ) * ( (1 + M_p/M_s )^(-2/3) ) * ( (P year)^(-1/3) ) )

But perhaps that's not the easiest way here.

Another approach: the star's velocity K is related to the planet's velocity via the mass ratio.

The star's velocity K = (V_planet) * (M_p / M_s )

But M_p is much less than M_s, so K ≈ V_p * (M_p / M_s )

But V_p is the planet's orbital speed, which is 2π a / P.

Hmm, but without P, the period, I can't relate a and K directly.

Wait, but maybe there's a way to find a in terms of K, M_p, and M_s.

The formula for the semi-amplitude of radial velocity is given by:

K = [ (v) ] = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_s + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P * c)) )^(1/3) ) * ( sin i )

Assuming i=90 degrees (edge-on orbit), so sin i =1.

But perhaps a better approach is to use Kepler's third law. Kepler's law says:

P² = (4π²/G(M_s + M_p)) ) * a^3

Since M_p << M_s, M_s + M_p ≈ M_s, so:

P² = (4π² / (G M_s )) ) * a^3

So P² = (4π² a³ )/(G M_s )

But we can relate P and a.

Wait, but how does K relate to a?

From the radial velocity formula, the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (2π G ) / (c P ) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_s + M_p )^(2/3) ) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_s, M_s + M_p ≈ M_s, so:

K ≈ ( (2π G ) / (c P ) )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( M_s^(2/3) )

But again, sin i is 1 (edge-on), so:

K ≈ ( (2π G )^(1/3) ) / ( c^(1/3) P^(1/3) ) ) * ( M_p ) / ( M_s^(2/3) )

Hmm, perhaps I can cube both sides to get:

K³ = ( (2π G ) / (c³ P ) ) * ( M_p³ ) / ( M_s² )

But this seems a bit complicated. Alternatively, maybe it's better to use the relation between K and a.

Wait, another way: the star's velocity K is related to how much it's being pulled by the planet. The gravitational force makes the star move in a small orbit. The star's velocity can be linked to the planet's velocity.

But perhaps another approach. Since both planets are orbiting the same star, and assuming that the RV method gives K for each, which is proportional to (M_p) / (a²) )^(1/3) or something like that. Alternatively, let's think about the relation between K and a.

Wait, let me think: the star's velocity K is given by the formula K = (v) = (M_p / M_s) * (V_p), where V_p is the planet's orbital speed. And V_p = 2π a / P.

But using Kepler's third law: P² = (4π² a³)/(G M_s )

So V_p = 2π a / P = (2π a ) / ( (4π² a³/(G M_s ) )^(1/2) )

= (2π a) / ( (2π a^(3/2) ) / sqrt(G M_s) ) )

= (2π a * sqrt(G M_s) ) ) / (2 π a^(3/2) ) )

= sqrt( G M_s ) / sqrt( a )

So V_p = sqrt( G M_s / a )

So K = (M_p / M_s) * sqrt( G M_s / a )

= (M_p) / sqrt( M_s a ) ) * sqrt( G )

= M_p * sqrt( G ) / sqrt( M_s a )

Hmm, that's an expression for K in terms of a, M_p, M_s, and G.

So solving for a:

K = M_p * sqrt(G) / sqrt( M_s a )

=> sqrt( M_s a ) = M_p sqrt(G) / K

=> M_s a = ( M_p² G ) / K²

=> a = ( M_p² G ) / ( M_s K² )

So a is proportional to M_p² / (M_s K² )

Wait, so a1 / a2 = ( ( M_p1² / (M_s K1² )) ) / ( ( M_p2² / (M_s K2² )) ) )

= ( M_p1² K2² ) / ( M_p2² K1² )

Because the M_s cancels out.

So a1/a2 = ( (M_p1 / M_p2 )^2 ) * ( K2 / K1 )^2 )

Plugging in the numbers:

M_p1 =7 Earth masses, M_p2=5.

So (7/5)^2 =49/25=1.96.

K1 is 1428 m/s (from earlier calculation), K2 is 1904.7 m/s.

So K2/K1= 1904.7/1428 ≈1.334.

So (K2/K1)^2 ≈ (1.334)^2 ≈1.78.

So a1/a2= 1.96 *1.78 ≈3.50.

Wait, but wait, because a1 is proportional to (M_p1^2 K2^2) / ( M_p2^2 K1^2 ), so a1 = [ (7^2 * K2^2 ) ] / [5^2 * K1^2 ] * a2, but wait, no, because a1/a2 = (7^2 * K2²) / (5^2 * K1^2 )

Wait, let me recheck:

a1/a2 = ( (7^2) * (K2)^2 ) / ( (5^2) * (K1)^2 ) )

So 7²=49, 5²=25.

So 49/25 =1.96.

K2=1904.7, K1=1428.

So K2/K1= 1904.7 /1428 ≈1.334.

So (K2/K1)^2= (1.334)^2 ≈1.78.

So a1/a2=1.96 *1.78 ≈3.50.

Wait, that would mean a1 is about 3.5 times a2, meaning Planet1 is farther from the star than Planet2.

But then, equilibrium temperature depends on sqrt( R_star / a ), so T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Since a1 is 3.5 a2, a2/a1 is 1/3.5≈0.2857.

So sqrt(0.2857)≈0.5345.

So T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈0.5345, which is about 0.53.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.53.


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we use the equilibrium temperature formula:

\[
T_{\text{eq}} \propto T_{\text{star}} \sqrt{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a}}
\]

where \(a\) is the orbital distance of the planet from the star. Since both planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures depends only on the ratio of their orbital distances:

\[
\frac{T_{\text{eq,1}}}{T_{\text{eq,2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

To find \(a_1\) and \(a_2\), we use the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV semi-amplitude \(K\) is related to the orbital distance \(a\) by:

\[
a \propto \frac{M_p^2}{K^2}
\]

where \(M_p\) is the planet's mass and \(K\) is the RV semi-amplitude. For two planets, the ratio of their orbital distances is:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{M_p1^2 K_2^2}{M_p2^2 K_1^2}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \(K_1\) and \(K_2\)
The Doppler shift \(\Delta \lambda\) is related to the star's velocity \(v\) by:

\[
v = \frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda} \cdot c
\]

For Planet1 (\(\Delta \lambda = 0.03 \, \text{Å}\), \(\lambda = 6300 \, \text{Å}\)):

\[
K_1 = \frac{0.03}{6300} \cdot 3 \times 10^8 = 1428 \, \text{m/s}
\]

For Planet2 (\(\Delta \lambda = 0.04 \, \text{Å}\), \(\lambda = 6300 \, \text{Å}\)):

\[
K_2 = \frac{0.04}{6300} \cdot 3 \times 10^8 = 1904.7 \, \text{m/s}
\]

### Step 2: Compute the ratio \(a_1 / a_2\)
The masses of the planets are \(M_{p1} = 7 \, M_{\text{Earth}}\) and \(M_{p2} = 5 \, M_{\text{Earth}}\). Substituting into the formula:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{(M_{p1})^2 (K_2)^2}{(M_{p2})^2 (K_1)^2}
\]

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{(7^2) (1904.7^2)}{(5^2) (1428^2)}
\]

First, calculate the mass ratio squared:

\[
\frac{M_{p1}^2}{M_{p2}^2} = \frac{7^2}{5^2} = \frac{49}{25} = 1.96
\]

Next, calculate the velocity ratio squared:

\[
\frac{K_2^2}{K_1^2} = \left(\frac{1904.7}{1428}\right)^2 \approx (1.334)^2 \approx 1.78
\]

Now, combine the results:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = 1.96 \cdot 1.78 \approx 3.5
\]

### Step 3: Compute the equilibrium temperature ratio
The equilibrium temperature ratio is:

\[
\frac{T_{\text{eq,1}}}{T_{\text{eq,2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Since \(a_1 / a_2 = 3.5\), we have:

\[
\frac{T_{\text{eq,1}}}{T_{\text{eq,2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{3.5}} = \sqrt{0.2857} \approx 0.53
\]

### Final Answer:
The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately **0.53**.
