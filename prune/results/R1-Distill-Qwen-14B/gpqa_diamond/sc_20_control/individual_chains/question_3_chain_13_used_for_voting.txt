Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see. It's about a spin-half particle in a specific state and calculating the expectation value of an operator. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says the particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. The states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of σz. I need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx.

Wait, expectation value. Right, the expectation value of an operator is the average value you'd measure if you measured that observable many times on identically prepared systems. So I need to compute ⟨ψ| (10σz +5σx) |ψ⟩, where |ψ⟩ is given.

Let me recall the formula. The expectation value ⟨A⟩ is ⟨ψ| A |ψ⟩. So I can expand this as 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩ because expectation values are linear. So I can compute each part separately.

First, let me find ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, with eigenvalues +1 and -1 respectively. So, the expectation value of σz is the probability of being in |↑⟩ times +1 plus the probability of |↓⟩ times -1.

Looking at the state ψ: 0.5 |↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. The coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. So the probabilities are the squares of these coefficients.

Calculating the squares: (0.5)^2 = 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4) which is 0.75. So, the probabilities are 0.25 and 0.75.

So ⟨σz⟩ = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

That's straightforward. Now for ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is the Pauli X matrix. Its eigenstates are |+x⟩ and |−x⟩, but maybe there's another way to compute ⟨σx⟩ without switching bases.

Alternatively, I can write σx in terms of the computational basis. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So, when I have a state |ψ⟩, ⟨σx⟩ is ψ† σx ψ.

Wait, let me write it out. Let me represent |ψ⟩ as a vector. |↑⟩ is [1, 0] and |↓⟩ is [0, 1]. So the state ψ is 0.5 [1,0] + (sqrt(3)/2) [0,1], which is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

So ψ is a column vector [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. Now σx is [[0,1],[1,0]].

So to compute ⟨σx⟩, I can compute ψ† σx ψ. That would be the product of the conjugate transpose of ψ, then σx, then ψ.

Since ψ is real here, the conjugate doesn't matter. So ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

Multiplying ψ† σx gives [0.5, sqrt(3)/2 ] * [[0,1],[1,0]] = [ sqrt(3)/2, 0.5 ].

Then, multiply this by ψ, which is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2 ].

So the product is (sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5) + (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) ) = sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

Wait, let me recalculate that. Let me do it step by step.

ψ† σx = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [[0,1],[1,0]] = [ (0*0.5 +1*sqrt(3)/2 ), (1*0.5 +0*sqrt(3)/2 ) ] → [ sqrt(3)/2, 0.5 ]

Now multiply this with ψ → [ sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5 ] + [ 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 ] → ( (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) ) *2 → sqrt(3)/2 * (0.5 + 0.5 ) ? Wait, wait, no, because it's (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 + 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2). So each term is sqrt(3)/4, so together sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So ⟨σx⟩ is approximately 0.866.

Wait, but wait a second, the state is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]. So when I compute ψ† σx ψ, it's the same as the inner product of σx|ψ⟩ and |ψ⟩.

Alternatively, I could compute σx |ψ⟩ first and then take the inner product with |ψ⟩.

Let me try that approach. σx |ψ⟩ is σx [0.5; sqrt(3)/2] = [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5]. Then take the inner product with ψ, which is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], so 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5 = same as before: sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2.

So yes, ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2. Hmm.

But wait, sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, so sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866.

So now, going back to ⟨10σz +5σx⟩.

That's 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2).

Let me compute each term.

10*(-0.5) is -5.

5*(sqrt(3)/2) is (5 * 1.732)/2 ≈ (8.66)/2 ≈4.33.

So adding together: -5 +4.33 = -0.67.

Wait, wait, let me make sure. 5*(sqrt(3)/2) is 5*(0.866) ≈4.33.

So total is -5 +4.33 = -0.67.

But wait, the options are A) -1.4, B)1.65, C)-0.7, D)0.85.

Hmm, -0.67 is approximately -0.7, which is option C.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the exact value.

sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.8660254. So 5 * 0.8660254 ≈4.330127.

So 10*σz gives 10*(-0.5)= -5.

Adding 4.330127 gives -5 +4.330127 =-0.669873, which is approximately -0.67. Rounding to one decimal place is -0.7.

So the expectation value is -0.7, which is option C.

Wait, but wait a moment. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistake with the initial state. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Let me check the normalization. The sum of squares: (0.5)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 0.25 + 0.75 =1. So the state is correctly normalized.

So the calculations look correct. So the answer should be option C) -0.7.

To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given state \( |\psi\rangle = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are eigenstates of \( \sigma_z \) with eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively.

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
The expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is given by:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = P(|\uparrow\rangle) \cdot (+1) + P(|\downarrow\rangle) \cdot (-1),
\]
where \( P(|\uparrow\rangle) \) and \( P(|\downarrow\rangle) \) are the probabilities of the particle being in \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \), respectively. These probabilities are the squares of the coefficients of \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) in \( |\psi\rangle \):
\[
P(|\uparrow\rangle) = (0.5)^2 = 0.25, \quad P(|\downarrow\rangle) = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 0.75.
\]
Thus:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The Pauli \( \sigma_x \) operator is represented by the matrix:
\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
The expectation value \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \) is computed as:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle.
\]
Expressing \( |\psi\rangle \) as a vector:
\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix},
\]
we compute:
\[
\langle \psi | \sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 & \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} & 0.5 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
Then:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} & 0.5 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.5 + 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]
Approximating \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \), we find:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle \approx \frac{1.732}{2} \approx 0.866.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \)
The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10(-0.5) + 5(0.866) = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]
Rounding to one decimal place, the result is:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle \approx -0.7.
\]

### Final Answer:
The expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is approximately **-0.7**, which corresponds to option **C**.

So the product is (sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5) + (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) ) = sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

Wait, let me recalculate that. Let me do it step by step.

ψ† σx = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [[0,1],[1,0]] = [ (0*0.5 +1*sqrt(3)/2 ), (1*0.5 +0*sqrt(3)/2 ) ] → [ sqrt(3)/2, 0.5 ]

Now multiply this with ψ → [ sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5 ] + [ 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 ] → ( (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) ) *2 → sqrt(3)/2 * (0.5 + 0.5 ) ? Wait, wait, no, because it's (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 + 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2). So each term is sqrt(3)/4, so together sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So ⟨σx⟩ is approximately 0.866.

But wait, sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, so sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866.

So now, going back to ⟨10σz +5σx⟩.

That's 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2).

Let me compute each term.

10*(-0.5) is -5.

5*(sqrt(3)/2) is (5 * 1.732)/2 ≈ (8.66)/2 ≈4.33.

So adding together: -5 +4.33 = -0.67.

To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given state \( |\psi\rangle = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are eigenstates of \( \sigma_z \) with eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively.

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
The expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is given by:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = P(|\uparrow\rangle) \cdot (+1) + P(|\downarrow\rangle) \cdot (-1),
\]
where \( P(|\uparrow\rangle) \) and \( P(|\downarrow\rangle) \) are the probabilities of the particle being in \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \), respectively. These probabilities are the squares of the coefficients of \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) in \( |\psi\rangle \):
\[
P(|\uparrow\rangle) = (0.5)^2 = 0.25, \quad P(|\downarrow\rangle) = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 0.75.
\]
Thus:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The Pauli \( \sigma_x \) operator is represented by the matrix:
\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
The expectation value \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \) is computed as:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle.
\]
Expressing \( |\psi\rangle \) as a vector:
\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix},
\]
we compute:
\[
\langle \psi | \sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 & \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} & 0.5 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
Then:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} & 0.5 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.5 + 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]
Approximating \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \), we find:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle \approx \frac{1.732}{2} \approx 0.866.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \)
The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10(-0.5) + 5(0.866) = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]
Rounding to one decimal place, the result is:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle \approx -0.7.
\]

### Final Answer:
The expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is approximately **-0.7**, which corresponds to option **C**.

Answer: C
