Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10.

Hmm, right. So I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, meaning it forms complexes with metal ions. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, which I think is written as CaY²- where Y is the EDTA^4- after it's deprotonated. 

The problem gives me the concentration of the complex, which I'll call [CaY²-] as 0.02 M. I need to find the concentration of free Ca²+ ions in the solution. 

I think the formation constant (Kf) is used in these kinds of problems. Kf is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The formula for Kf is:

Kf = [CaY²-] / ([Ca²+][EDTA])

Wait, wait, no. Wait, when EDTA binds to Ca²+, the overall reaction is:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²- 

So the equilibrium expression would be Kf = [CaEDTA²-] / ( [Ca²+] [EDTA^4-] )

Yes, that's right. So Kf is given as 5e10.

But in this solution, the only EDTA present is the complex form, right? Because if you have a stoichiometric solution, then it's just the complex, and the free EDTA and Ca²+ are what's left in solution. Wait, but how much is there?

Wait, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So [CaY²-] = 0.02 M. Now, I need to find [Ca²+] in solution. Assuming that the solution is in equilibrium, so some of the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Wait, but EDTA is a polydentate ligand. In this case, the complex is CaY²- (EDTA has four negative charges when fully deprotonated). But in solution, pH affects the proportion of EDTA in the Y^4- form. Oh, but the problem says pH is ideal, so maybe we can assume that all the EDTA is in the Y^4- form. So we don't have to worry about other protonated forms of EDTA.

So, given that, the problem simplifies. The complex is 0.02 M. Let me model the dissociation.

The complex dissociates as:

CaY²- ↔ Ca²+ + Y^4-

The formation constant Kf is 5e10, so the dissociation constant, Kd, would be 1/Kf. Because Kf = [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][Y^4-]) → Kd = [Ca²+][Y^4-]/[CaY²-] = 1/Kf.

So Kd = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

Now, let's denote the concentration of Ca²+ as x. Since the dissociation produces x moles of both Ca²+ and EDTA^4- per mole of complex that dissociates, then [Ca²+] = x and [Y^4-] = x. 

So, substituting into the Kd expression:

Kd = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) = x² / (0.02 - x) = 2e-11.

Assuming that x is much smaller than 0.02, because Kd is very small (since Kf is large), the denominator can be approximated as 0.02. So:

x² / 0.02 ≈ 2e-11 → x² ≈ 0.02 * 2e-11 → x² ≈ 4e-13 → x ≈ sqrt(4e-13) → x ≈ 2e-6.5 → Wait, 4e-13's square root is 2e-6.5? Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6, so square of 2e-6 is 4e-12. Hmm, wait, 2e-6 is 2e-6, square is 4e-12, but 4e-13 is 10 times smaller. So x would be sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, because (2e-6.5)^2 = (2^2)*(1e-13) )=4e-13. Oh, right, because 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7, since 10^0.5 is about 3.16. So 2e-6.5 is about 6.32e-7.

Wait, wait, let me calculate sqrt(4e-13) properly.

sqrt(4e-13) = sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) )= 2 * 1e-6.5 = 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7 M.

So x is approximately 6.32e-7 M. 

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M, which matches closely. Option C is 6.3x10^-7.

Wait, but let me check the assumption that x is much smaller than 0.02. x is about 6.3e-7, which is 0.00000063 M. 0.02 is 0.02 M, so 0.02 >> x. So the approximation holds. So the calculation is valid.

So the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex (CaY²⁻), we use the dissociation equilibrium:

\[
\text{CaY}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{Y}^{4-}
\]

The dissociation constant \( K_d \) is related to the formation constant \( K_f \) by:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K_f}
\]

Given \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \), we calculate:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}
\]

Let the concentration of dissociated \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) and \( \text{Y}^{4-} \) be \( x \). The equilibrium expression becomes:

\[
K_d = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{Y}^{4-}]}{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]}
\]

Substituting \( [\text{CaY}^{2-}] = 0.02 \, \text{M} \) and assuming \( x \ll 0.02 \), we approximate:

\[
K_d \approx \frac{x^2}{0.02}
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = K_d \cdot 0.02 = (2 \times 10^{-11})(0.02) = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which matches option C.

So we don't have to worry about other protonated forms of EDTA.

So, given that, the problem simplifies. The complex is 0.02 M. Let me model the dissociation.

The complex dissociates as:

CaY²- ↔ Ca²+ + Y^4-

The formation constant Kf is 5e10, so the dissociation constant, Kd, would be 1/Kf. Because Kf = [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][Y^4-]) → Kd = [Ca²+][Y^4-]/[CaY²-] = 1/Kf.

So Kd = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

Now, let's denote the concentration of Ca²+ as x. Since the dissociation produces x moles of both Ca²+ and EDTA^4- per mole of complex that dissociates, then [Ca²+] = x and [Y^4-] = x. 

So, substituting into the Kd expression:

Kd = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) = x² / (0.02 - x) = 2e-11.

Assuming that x is much smaller than 0.02, because Kd is very small (since Kf is large), the denominator can be approximated as 0.02. So:

x² / 0.02 ≈ 2e-11 → x² ≈ 0.02 * 2e-11 → x² ≈ 4e-13 → x ≈ sqrt(4e-13) → x ≈ 2e-6.5 → Wait, 4e-13's square root is 2e-6.5? Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6, so square of 2e-6 is 4e-12. Hmm, wait, 2e-6 is 2e-6, square is 4e-12, but 4e-13 is 10 times smaller. So x would be sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, because (2e-6.5)^2 = (2^2)*(1e-13) )=4e-13. Oh, right, because 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7, since 10^0.5 is about 3.16. So 2e-6.5 is about 6.32e-7.

Wait, wait, let me calculate sqrt(4e-13) properly.

sqrt(4e-13) = sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) )= 2 * 1e-6.5 = 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7 M.

So x is approximately 6.32e-7 M. 

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M, which matches closely. Option C is 6.3x10^-7.

Wait, but let me check the assumption that x is much smaller than 0.02. x is about 6.3e-7, which is 0.00000063 M. 0.02 is 0.02 M, so 0.02 >> x. So the approximation holds. So the calculation is valid.

So the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.

\[
K_d \approx \frac{x^2}{0.02}
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = K_d \cdot 0.02 = (2 \times 10^{-11})(0.02) = 4 \times 10^{-13}

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which matches option C.
