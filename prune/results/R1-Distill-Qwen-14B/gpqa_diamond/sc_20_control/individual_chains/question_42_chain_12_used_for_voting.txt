Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, there are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. But maybe that's not super important for solving this problem. The question involves their equilibrium temperatures and masses, and we're supposed to find the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1's.

The given data points are:
- The ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.4. So, TE1/TE2 = 1.4.
- The ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3. So, TE2/TE3 = 2.3.
- The mass ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.15. So, M1/M2 = 1.15.
- The ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 1.35. So, M2/M3 = 1.35.
- The albedo for all is 0.3, same as Earth.

We need to find the factor by which Planet3's orbital period is larger than Planet1's. So, Period3 / Period1 = ?

Hmm, I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by the formula:

TE = [ ( L (1 - a) ) / (16 * π * σ * D²) ) ]^(1/4)

Where L is the star's luminosity, a is the planet's albedo, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and D is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.

But wait, since all three planets are orbiting the same star, L and σ are constants for them. The albedo is the same for all, so (1 -a) is also the same. So, the equilibrium temperature TE is proportional to (1/D)^(1/2), because TE scales as (1/D)^(1/2). Alternatively, TE is proportional to 1/sqrt(D), because when you take the 1/4 power of 1/D², you get 1/D^(1/2).

So, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between two planets would be sqrt(D2/D1), assuming same L and a. Wait, wait, let me think again. Let me restate the formula.

TE is proportional to sqrt(L/(16πσ)) * (1 - a)^(1/4) / D^(1/2). So, since L, a, and σ are same for all, TE is proportional to 1/sqrt(D). So, TE1/TE2 = sqrt(D2/D1). So, if TE1/TE2 is 1.4, then sqrt(D2/D1) = 1.4. Squaring both sides, D2/D1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So D2 ≈ 1.96 * D1.

Similarly, TE2/TE3 is 2.3. So, sqrt(D3/D2) = 2.3. So D3/D2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29. So D3 = 5.29 * D2.

Putting these together, D3 = 5.29 * D2 = 5.29 * 1.96 * D1. Let me calculate that: 5.29 * 1.96.

Hmm, 5 * 1.96 is 9.8, and 0.29 * 1.96 is about 0.5684. So total is 9.8 + 0.5684 = 10.3684. So D3 ≈ 10.37 * D1.

So the semi-major axis of Planet3 is about 10.37 times that of Planet1.

Wait, but we're looking for the orbital period, not the distance. So, Kepler's third law comes into play here. Kepler's law says that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis, so P² ∝ D³. So, P is proportional to D^(3/2).

So, the ratio (P3/P1) = (D3/D1)^(3/2).

We have D3/D1 ≈ 10.37, so (10.37)^(3/2) = ?

Let me calculate that. 10.37^(1/2) is sqrt(10.37) ≈ 3.22. Then 3.22^3 is 3.22 * 3.22 * 3.22.

3.22 *3.22 is about 10.3684. Then multiply by 3.22 again: 10.3684 *3.22 ≈ let's see.

10 *3.22 is 32.2, 0.3684*3.22 ≈ 1.185. So total is about 32.2 +1.185 = 33.385. So approximately 33.4.

So the period ratio P3/P1 is about 33.4. Looking at the options, option D is ~33.4.

Wait, but I should double-check because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through the steps again.

Equilibrium temperatures: TE1/TE2 = sqrt(D2/D1) = 1.4 → D2/D1 = 1.96 → D2 = 1.96 D1.

TE2/TE3 = 2.3 → sqrt(D3/D2) = 2.3 → D3/D2 = 5.29 → D3 = 5.29 D2 = 5.29 *1.96 D1.

Calculating 5.29 *1.96: Let me compute it more accurately.

5.29 × 1.96:
Break it down:
5 × 1.96 = 9.8
0.29 ×1.96 = let's compute 0.2 *1.96 =0.392; 0.09 *1.96=0.1764 → total 0.5684. So total is 9.8 +0.5684=10.3684 → D3=10.3684 D1.

So P3/P1 = (D3/D1)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^(3/2). Let's compute 10.3684^ (3/2).

First, sqrt(10.3684) = approx 3.22 (since 3.2^2=10.24; 3.22^2=10.3684 exactly). Oh wait, wait! 3.22 squared is exactly 10.3684 because 3*3 is 9, 0.22 squared is ~0.0484, and the cross terms are 2*3*0.22=1.32. So 9 +1.32 +0.0484=10.3684. So sqrt(10.3684)=3.22 exactly.

So (10.3684)^(3/2) = (sqrt(10.3684))^3 = (3.22)^3.

Calculating 3.22^3: 3.22 *3.22 = 10.3684 as before. Then 10.3684 *3.22.

Let me compute that precisely.

10 *3.22=32.2.

0.3684 *3.22:

0.3 *3.22=0.966

0.06 *3.22=0.1932

0.0084*3.22≈0.027048.

Adding them up: 0.966 +0.1932=1.1592 +0.027048≈1.186248.

So total is 32.2 +1.186248 = 33.386248.

Which is approx 33.39. So the ratio is about 33.4, which matches option D.

But wait, the question gives the mass ratios as well. Oh wait, I didn't use the mass ratios. Did I miss something?

Wait, the question gives mass ratios, but in the equilibrium temperature formula, mass doesn't come into play. Equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's albedo, and the distance. So the mass of the planet doesn't affect its equilibrium temperature. So the mass ratios are given but not needed for this particular calculation. So I think I'm correct in ignoring them.

So the answer should be option D, approximately 33.4.

To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we analyze the given data and apply relevant physical principles.

### Key Information:
1. **Equilibrium Temperatures**:
   - The equilibrium temperature \( T_E \) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{D}} \), where \( D \) is the semi-major axis. Thus, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between two planets is given by:
     \[
     \frac{T_{E1}}{T_{E2}} = \sqrt{\frac{D_2}{D_1}}
     \]
   - For Planet1 and Planet2: \( \frac{T_{E1}}{T_{E2}} = 1.4 \), so:
     \[
     \sqrt{\frac{D_2}{D_1}} = 1.4 \implies \frac{D_2}{D_1} = 1.96
     \]
   - For Planet2 and Planet3: \( \frac{T_{E2}}{T_{E3}} = 2.3 \), so:
     \[
     \sqrt{\frac{D_3}{D_2}} = 2.3 \implies \frac{D_3}{D_2} = 5.29
     \]

2. **Semi-Major Axis of Planet3**:
   Combining the above results:
   \[
   \frac{D_3}{D_1} = \frac{D_3}{D_2} \cdot \frac{D_2}{D_1} = 5.29 \cdot 1.96 = 10.3684
   \]
   Thus, \( D_3 \approx 10.37 \cdot D_1 \).

3. **Orbital Period Ratio**:
   Using Kepler's third law, the orbital period \( P \) is proportional to \( D^{3/2} \). Therefore:
   \[
   \frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left(\frac{D_3}{D_1}\right)^{3/2}
   \]
   Substituting \( \frac{D_3}{D_1} = 10.3684 \):
   \[
   \frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.3684)^{3/2}
   \]
   First, calculate \( \sqrt{10.3684} \):
   \[
   \sqrt{10.3684} \approx 3.22
   \]
   Then, calculate \( (3.22)^3 \):
   \[
   3.22^3 = 3.22 \cdot 3.22 \cdot 3.22 \approx 33.4
   \]

### Conclusion:
The orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1. The mass ratios provided are not relevant to the calculation of equilibrium temperature or orbital period.

Putting these together, D3 = 5.29 * D2 = 5.29 * 1.96 * D1. Let me calculate that: 5.29 * 1.96.

Hmm, 5 * 1.96 is 9.8, and 0.29 * 1.96 is about 0.5684. So total is 9.8 + 0.5684 = 10.3684. So D3 ≈ 10.37 * D1.

So, the ratio (P3/P1) = (D3/D1)^(3/2).

We have D3/D1 ≈ 10.37, so (10.37)^(3/2) = ?

Let me calculate that. 10.37^(1/2) is sqrt(10.37) ≈ 3.22. Then 3.22^3 is 3.22 * 3.22 * 3.22.

3.22 *3.22 is about 10.3684. Then multiply by 3.22 again: 10.3684 *3.22 ≈ let's see.

10 *3.22 is 32.2, 0.3684*3.22 ≈ 1.185. So total is about 32.2 +1.185 = 33.385. So approximately 33.4.

So the period ratio P3/P1 is about 33.4. Looking at the options, option D is ~33.4.

Wait, but I should double-check because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through the steps again.
