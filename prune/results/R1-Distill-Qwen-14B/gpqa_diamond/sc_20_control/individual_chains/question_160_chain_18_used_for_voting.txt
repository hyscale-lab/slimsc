Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light of wavelength λ is shining vertically onto this aperture, and we're supposed to find the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field when N is infinitely large. The options are given, and we can use the small angle approximation where tanθ ≈ θ.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the setup. An aperture with a polygonal shape, each side having the same apothem. Wait, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side, right? So if all apothems are the same length 'a', the polygon is regular but maybe not necessarily the same as a circle. But when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle with radius a, right? Because each apothem is 'a' and as the number of sides increases, the polygon tends towards a circle.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. For a regular polygon, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So if all apothems are the same length 'a', then as N increases, the polygon becomes more like a circle with radius 'a'? Or is the radius something else? Because for a regular polygon, the radius (circumradius) R is related to the apothem 'a' by R = a / cos(π/N). So as N approaches infinity, cos(π/N) approaches 1, so R approaches 'a'. So the effective shape becomes a circle of radius 'a' when N is very large.

Wait, but the question says all apothems are the same. So when N is large, the polygon approaches a circle with radius 'a' because the apothem is the same for each side. So when the problem says N is infinitely large, the aperture becomes a circle. So the problem reduces to finding the angular distance between the first two minima when the aperture is a circle. Oh wait, but wait, no—because the problem is about a polygon, but when N is very large, it's approximated as a circle. So the diffraction pattern would be similar to a circular aperture.

Wait, but wait, for a circular aperture, the diffraction minima occur at certain angles. The first minima in the far field (Fraunhofer diffraction) for a circular aperture is at an angle θ given by the formula sinθ = λ/(π a), because the first minimum is at the first zero of the Bessel function J1. But wait, wait, no—let me think again. The single-slit diffraction for a circular aperture is a bit different. The minima in the far field for a circular aperture occur at angles where the Bessel function J_m has zeros. The first minimum occurs at the first zero of J1, which is at θ = 1.838... times λ/(π a), but wait, wait, wait. Let me get this straight.

Wait, the Fraunhofer diffraction from a circular aperture has a pattern where the first dark ring (minimum) occurs at a certain angle. The formula for the angle where the minima occur is given by a * sinθ = m * λ, where m is an integer, but wait, that's for a single slit. No, wait, for a circular aperture, the minima are not as straightforward. The minima occur at angles where the Bessel functions have their zeros. The first minimum beyond the central maximum occurs at a certain condition.

Wait, perhaps I should recall the formula for the minima in a circular aperture. The zero points of the Bessel function J_(m) (where m is an integer) determine the minima. The first minimum (the smallest θ) occurs at the first zero of J1. The first zero of J1 is at θ ≈ 1.838 * λ/(π a), but wait, no. Let me correct. The condition is that a sinθ = x_m, where x_m is the m-th zero of J_(m+1). For the first minimum, m=1, so x_1 is the first zero of J1, which is approximately 3.832. Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think.

Wait, the formula for the dark rings in a circular aperture is when a sinθ = x_m, where x_m is the m-th zero of J1. So the first minimum (m=1) is at x=3.8317... So the angle θ would be sinθ = (3.8317 λ)/(a π). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the formula is a sinθ = x, where x is the m-th zero of Jm. For the first minimum in the far field (the first dark ring), m=1, so x is the first zero of J1, which is about 3.8317. So θ = arcsin(3.8317 λ/(a π)). But wait, the problem states that we can use the small angle approximation, tanθ ≈ θ. So for small angles, sinθ ≈ θ. Thus, θ ≈ 3.8317 λ/(a π).

But wait, the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. Wait, but in a circular aperture, the first minima are at a certain angle, and perhaps the next minima are further out. But I thought the first minimum is at θ1 = 3.8317 λ/(a π), and the next would be at θ2 = 7.0156 λ/(a π), perhaps. So the angular separation between the first two minima would be θ2 - θ1 = (7.0156 - 3.8317) * λ/(a π) ≈ 3.1839 λ/(a π). But wait, that can't be right because I'm not seeing that in the options.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused between single-slit and circular diffraction. Let's backtrack. The problem is about a polygon with N sides approaching infinity, so it's a circular aperture. The question is about the angular distance between the first two minima.

Wait, but wait a second. Another approach: perhaps the question is not about a circular aperture, but about a polygonal aperture with N sides. But when N is very large, it's approximated as a circle. Alternatively, perhaps the polygon is approximated as a circle, so the diffraction pattern is similar to a circular aperture.

Wait, but maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the polygon is being considered as a "square" or another shape, but when N is infinite, it's a circle. But perhaps the approach is to model the polygon as a circle with a certain radius.

Wait, but wait—if the apothem is 'a', then the radius R of the polygon (distance from center to vertex) is R = a / cos(π/N). As N approaches infinity, cos(π/N) approaches 1, so R approaches 'a'. So the polygon becomes a circle with radius a.

So the problem reduces to finding the angular separation between the first two minima of a circular aperture's diffraction pattern.

Wait, but in that case, the first minimum occurs at a sinθ = λ, but no, that's for a single slit. For a circular aperture, it's more complicated.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. Maybe the problem is not about a circular aperture, but about a polygonal aperture, but when N is large, so it's approximated as a circle. So perhaps the minima can be found using the same approach as for a single slit, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should model the polygon as having many sides, and compute the diffraction pattern. For a regular polygon with a large N, the far field diffraction pattern can be approximated by considering the polygon as a circle. Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be treated using the same approach as a single slit, but with a different effective width.

Wait, another approach: for small angles, the diffraction minima for a single slit occur at d sinθ = m λ, m=1,2,3... The angular separation between successive minima would be ( (m+1) λ / d ) - ( m λ /d ) ) = λ/(d sinθ), but wait, but that's for single-slit, not a polygon.

Wait, but in our case, the polygon is approximated as a circle, so perhaps the first minimum occurs at θ = λ/(π a), similar to the circular aperture's first minimum. Wait, no, that's not correct. The first zero of J1 is at x ≈ 3.8317, so the first minimum occurs at θ ≈ (3.8317 λ)/(a π). But wait, that's for a circular aperture. So the first minimum is at about 3.8317 λ/(a π).

The second minimum would be at the next zero of J1, which is x≈7.0156. So the second minimum is at θ≈7.0156 λ/(a π). The angular separation between the first and second minima is (7.0156 - 3.8317) λ/(a π) ≈ 3.1839 λ/(a π) ≈ 3.184 * λ/(a π). Let me compute that numerically: 3.184 / 3.1416 ≈ 1.013, so approximately 1.013 * λ/(a * 1) = 1.013 λ/a.

But looking at the options, option C is 1.220 λ/a. That's close but not exactly matching. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in considering the zeros of the Bessel function.

Wait, wait another thought. Maybe the problem isn't about the circular aperture's minima but perhaps treating the polygon as a single slit with a certain width. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is more akin to a rectangular slit with width 'a' and height much larger, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a single-slit diffraction, where the slit width is 'a', and the first minimum is at θ = λ/(a). So the angular separation between the first two minima would be λ/(a). But that's for single-slit, but the options don't have that directly. Wait, option B is 0.5 λ/a, which is λ/(2a), but that can't be right for the first minima.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the polygon is a square, but as N approaches infinity, it's a circle. Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to model the polygon as a rectangular slit. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the concept of a polygon as an approximation of a circular aperture, but the calculation is done using the single-slit formula. Let me think. For a single slit, the minima are at d sinθ = m λ, m = 1, 2, 3, ... So the first minimum is at θ = arcsin(λ/d). For small angles, θ ≈ λ/d.

In this problem, perhaps the effective width of the slit is 2a, since the apothem is a, so the distance from one side to the opposite is 2a. So the slit width would be 2a, making the first minima at θ = λ/(2a). But that would be option B: 0.5 λ/a, since θ= (λ/(2a)) → 0.5 λ/a.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the effective width is 2a. Wait, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So for a polygon with N sides, each side is a line segment. The width of the polygon (from one side to the opposite) would be 2a, because the apothem is a, so the distance from center to each side is a, so the total width is 2a.

Ah, so if the polygon is approximated as a single slit of width w = 2a, then the first minima would be at θ = λ/(w) = λ/(2a), which is 0.5 λ/a. The angular separation between the first two minima would be between m=1 and m=2, which would be (2 λ/(2a)) - (λ/(2a)) )= λ/(2a) → 0.5 λ/a. So the angular separation is λ/(2a), which is option B.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. The first minima are at θ1 = λ/(2a) and θ2 = 2λ/(2a) = λ/a, so the separation is θ2 - θ1 = λ/(2a). So that's 0.5 λ/a, option B.

But wait, I thought for a polygon with N sides, as N approaches infinity, it would behave more like a circle, whose diffraction pattern is different. But perhaps the problem is treating it as a single slit with width 2a, which is a simpler approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a set of N slits, each contributing to the diffraction pattern, but that seems more complicated.

Wait, the problem says the polygon has all apothems equal to 'a'. So each side is a certain length, and the distance from the center to each side is 'a'. So the polygon is a regular polygon with apothem 'a'. So when N is large, it's a circle with radius R = a / cos(π/N), but for very large N, cos(π/N) ≈ 1 - (π^2)/(2 N^2), so R ≈ a (1 + (π^2)/(2 N^2) ), but as N approaches infinity, R approaches 'a'.

So the effective radius is 'a', and the problem is about a circle of radius 'a'—so that brings me back to the circular aperture's diffraction pattern.

In that case, the first minimum occurs at θ where a sinθ = λ * (3.8317)/(π), because the first zero of J1 is at x≈3.8317, which is the first minimum. So θ ≈ (3.8317 λ)/(a π). Similarly, the second minimum is at x=7.0156, so θ ≈ (7.0156 λ)/(a π). The separation between the first two minima is (7.0156 -3.8317) * λ/(a π) ≈ (3.1839) λ/(a π). Let's compute that: 3.1839 / π is approximately 1.013. So the separation is approximately 1.013 λ/a.

Looking at the options, option D is 0.506 λ/a, which is about half of this value. Option C is 1.220 λ/a, which is close but not exactly matching. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the problem is using the approximation for a single slit, not a circular aperture. Because in that case, the first minimum is at θ=λ/(2a), so the separation between first and second minima would be λ/(2a), which is option B.

But then why is the problem presented as a polygon with apothems 'a'? Oh, perhaps the polygon's effect is being considered as a single slit with width 2a, so the effective width is 2a. So the first minimum is at θ=λ/(2a), which is option B.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture is different. The first minimum is at a larger angle than the single-slit case. But perhaps the question is considering the polygon as a single slit with width 2a, and so the answer is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the concept of a rectangular aperture, but that seems unrelated.

Wait, another approach: when N is very large, the polygon becomes a circle, but if we model the diffraction as a single-slit scenario, perhaps only considering the width across the apothems.

Wait, perhaps in this problem, the polygon's width is 2a, and the height is much larger, so it's treated as a single slit of width 2a, leading to minima at θ= mλ/(2a). So the first minima are at θ=λ/(2a) (m=1) and θ=2λ/(2a)=λ/a (m=2). The separation between them is λ/(2a), which is option B: 0.500 λ/a.

But looking at the options, option D is 0.506 λ/a, which is close to 0.5. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me go back to the problem statement. It says, "the angular distance between the first two minima". For a single slit, the first minima are at m=1 and m=2, so separation is (2λ/(d)) - (λ/(d)) = λ/(d). But in this case, the slit width is 2a, so d=2a, so separation is λ/(2a), which is 0.5 λ/a → option B.

But wait, the problem mentions that the apothems are all length 'a'. So if the polygon is a regular polygon (like a square when N=4), each side is at a distance a from the center. So the width of the polygon (from one side to the opposite) is 2a. So if the polygon is treated as a single slit of width 2a, then the first minima are at θ=λ/(2a) and θ=2λ/(2a)=λ/a, giving a separation of λ/(2a) → option B.

But earlier, I thought the polygon becomes a circle, leading to a separation of about 1.013 λ/a, which is not among the options except option C (1.220) is close but not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the polygon is treated as a circle of radius a, leading to the first minima at θ= (3.8317 λ)/(a π). Let's compute that.

3.8317 / π ≈ 1.220, so θ1 ≈ 1.220 λ/(a). The next minimum would be at θ2=7.0156 λ/(a π) → 7.0156/π ≈ 2.229 λ/a. So the separation is 2.229 - 1.220 = 1.009 λ/a.

But none of the options match this. The closest is option C (1.220 λ/a), but that's the first minimum, not the separation.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something else. Maybe the problem isn't considering a circular aperture but a polygon with a different effective width.

Wait, perhaps the polygon's effective width is 2a tan(π/N), but as N approaches infinity, tan(π/N) approaches π/N. So 2a (π/N) → 0. So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for a single slit and the effective width is a. No, wait, because the apothem is a, which is the distance from the center to a side. So the width from one side to the opposite is 2a.

Hmm. This is getting a bit confusing. Let's try to approach it step-by-step.

1. The problem describes an N-sided polygon with all apothems equal to 'a'. So as N→∞, the polygon becomes a circle with radius R = a / cos(π/N) → a (since cos(π/N) →1).

2. When light shines through this aperture, the far-field diffraction pattern is considered. For a circular aperture, the minima occur where a sinθ = x_m λ, where x_m is the m-th zero of J1.

3. The first minimum (m=1) occurs at x=3.8317. So θ1 = arcsin(3.8317 λ/(a π)) ≈ 3.8317 λ/(a π) (using small angle approximation since 3.8317/(a π) is small if a is not too small).

4. The second minimum (m=2) occurs at x=7.0156, so θ2 ≈7.0156 λ/(a π).

5. The angular separation is θ2 - θ1 = (7.0156 -3.8317) * λ/(a π) ≈3.1839 λ/(a π) ≈ (3.1839/π) * (λ/a) ≈ 1.013 * λ/a.

But none of the options match this exactly. The closest option is C) 1.220 λ/a, which is approximately the value of θ1, not the separation.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the polygon as a single slit with width 2a, leading to minima at θ= mλ/(2a). So the first two minima are at θ=λ/(2a) (m=1) and θ=2λ/(2a)=λ/a (m=2). The separation is λ/(2a) = 0.5 λ/a, which is option B.

But why is the answer not option C, which matches the first minimum of the circular case?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the problem as a circular aperture. The question is about a polygon, even when N is large. So perhaps the approach is different.

Wait, another approach: For a polygon with a large N, the far-field diffraction pattern can be approximated as a single slit of width w = 2a, since the apothem is a, and the width is from one side to the opposite, which is 2a.

In that case, the first minimum occurs at θ1 = λ/(2a), and the second at θ2=2λ/(2a)=λ/a. So the separation is θ2 - θ1 = λ/(2a) → 0.5 λ/a, option B.

But the options don't have 1.013 λ/a, which would be the separation for the circular case. So perhaps the correct approach is to treat the polygon as a single slit of width 2a, leading to option B.

Wait, but the problem states that it's a polygon. So perhaps the correct approach is to consider the polygon as a single slit of width 2a, leading to the angular separation being λ/(2a), which is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a circle with radius a, leading to the angular separation being about 1.013 λ/a, but since this isn't an option, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the concept of the first minimum in a single-slit diffraction, where the first minimum is at θ= λ/(a), but that seems to not fit the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a single slit with width a, not 2a. So the first minima are at θ= mλ/a. So the separation between first and second minima is λ/a, which isn't an option.

Wait, the options given are:

A) 0.610 λ / a

B) 0.500 λ / a

C) 1.220 λ /a 

D) 0.506 λ / a

So option C is approximately 1.22 λ/a, which is close to 3.8317/(π) ≈ 1.220. So option C is the correct first minimum for a circular aperture. But the problem is asking for the separation between the first two minima, which would be about 1.013λ/a, which isn't an option. So perhaps the problem isn't about a circular aperture.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the polygon is a regular N-gon, and when N approaches infinity, the shape becomes a circle, but the diffraction pattern's first minima are the same as that of a circle. But the problem is asking for the separation between the first two minima, which would be the difference between the angles for the first and second minima.

So for a circular aperture, the first minima occur at θ1 = (3.8317 λ)/(a π) ≈ 1.22 λ/a, and the second at θ2 = (7.0156 λ)/(a π) ≈ 2.236 λ/a. The separation is θ2 - θ1 ≈ 1.015 λ/a.

Looking at the options, option D is 0.506 λ/a, which is about half of that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, such as considering the polygon as a set of N slits, each of width 2a/(N), leading to a more complex diffraction pattern. But this seems complicated, and I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to model the polygon as a single slit with width a, leading to the first minima at θ=λ/a, which isn't among the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a rectangular aperture with width a and height much larger. But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1.22 in the calculation, which is the first minimum for a circular aperture.

Wait, perhaps the question is actually related to the single-slit diffraction, where the first minima occur at θ=λ/d, and the separation between the first and second minima is λ/d. So if the slit width is d = 2a, then the separation is λ/(2a) = 0.5 λ/a → option B.

But why would the polygon be treated as a single slit? Because when N is large, the shape is a circle, but perhaps the problem is simplifying it.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not considering the polygon's diffraction pattern but using a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the minima in a single-slit diffraction. The first minima are at θ = λ/(a), but that would be if the slit width is a. But the problem says the apothems are a, so perhaps the width is 2a, leading to θ=λ/(2a) for the first minima.

So the separation between the first and second minima is (2λ/(2a)) - (λ/(2a)) = λ/(2a), which is option B.

But wait, the problem specifies that it's a polygon, not a single slit. So this approach might not be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to treat the polygon as a circle of radius a, leading to the first minimum at θ= (3.8317 λ)/(a π) ≈ 1.220 λ/a (option C), but the question is about the separation between the first two minima, which would be about 1.013 λ/a, not an option.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is C) 1.220 λ/a, but that's the first minima, not the separation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is mistaken, and the correct approach is to model it as a single slit, leading to option B.

But the options don't have 1.013 λ/a, so perhaps the correct answer is option D) 0.506 λ/a, which is approximately half of 1.013. Why would that be the case?

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a circle, but the separation is half the value I calculated. Because perhaps only the first and second minima in a certain region are considered.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Bessel function zeros. Let me double-check. The zeros of J1 are at 3.8317, 7.0156, 10.1735, etc. So the first minimum is at x=3.8317, the second at x=7.0156. The separation between the first two minima is (7.0156 -3.8317) = 3.1839. So the angle separation is 3.1839 * λ/(a π) ≈ 3.1839/(3.1416) λ/a ≈ 1.013 λ/a.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the correct approach is to treat the polygon as a single slit with width 2a, leading to the separation being 0.5 λ/a, option B.

But according to the options, option D is 0.506, which is close to 0.5. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should accept that the correct answer is option C, 1.220 λ/a, because that's the first minimum for a circular aperture, and the problem is asking for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is the first minimum itself. No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this and the correct answer is option C, 1.220 λ/a, but it's actually the first minimum, not the separation. So perhaps the problem is a trick question, and the angular distance between the first and second minima is the same as the first minimum angle, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the formula for the minima in a circular aperture. The formula is a sinθ = x_m λ, where x_m is the m-th zero of J1. So the first minima occurs at θ1 = arcsin( x_1 λ/(a) ), where x_1 is 3.8317. For small angles, θ1 ≈ x_1 λ/(a π), which is approximately 1.220 λ/(a) since 3.8317/π≈1.220.

The second minima is at θ2 ≈ x_2 λ/(a π) where x_2=7.0156, so θ2≈2.236 λ/(a). The separation is θ2 - θ1 ≈ (2.236 -1.220) λ/a ≈ 1.016 λ/a.

But none of the options have this. So perhaps the correct approach is to model it as a single slit, leading to option B (0.5 λ/a).

But I'm not entirely confident. Considering the options, the closest match to 1.013 λ/a isn't present, but option C is 1.220 λ/a, which is the angle of the first minimum in the circular case. But the question is about the separation between first and second minima, so perhaps I have to choose the option that's closest to 1.013 λ/a.

Wait, looking at the options again, option D is 0.506 λ/a, which is approximately 0.506. Hmm, 0.506 is about half of 1.013. So perhaps the correct answer is option D, but I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using only the first minimum in the pattern, perhaps treating the polygon as a single slit with width a, leading to the separation being λ/(a), but that's not an option.

This is getting quite confusing. To sum up:

- If the problem is about a circular aperture, the separation between first and second minima is approximately 1.013 λ/a, which isn't an option.

- If the problem is treated as a single slit with width 2a, the separation is 0.5 λ/a → option B.

- The only option that includes 1.220 is option C, which is the first minimum's angle for a circular aperture.

Hmm. I think I might have to go with the single-slit approach, treating the polygon as a single slit with width 2a. So the angular separation is 0.5 λ/a → option B. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, but the question states that the apothems are all the same length 'a'. So perhaps the polygon's width is 2a, and the problem is treating it as a single slit with width 2a. So the first minimum is at θ=λ/(2a), which would give a separation between first and second minima of λ/(2a), option B.

So after this lengthy thought process, even though I'm a bit uncertain, I'll go with option B: 0.500 λ/a.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves an aperture shaped as an N-sided polygon with all apothems equal to \(a\). When \(N\) approaches infinity, the polygon approximates a circle of radius \(a\). Monochromatic light of wavelength \(\lambda\) falls vertically on this aperture, and the goal is to determine the angular distance between the first two minima in the far-field diffraction pattern.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Polygon Approximation as a Circle**:  
   For large \(N\), the polygon becomes a circle with radius \(a\). The diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is determined by the zeros of the Bessel function \(J_1(x)\). The first minimum occurs at \(x_1 \approx 3.8317\), and the second minimum at \(x_2 \approx 7.0156\). Using the small-angle approximation (\(\sin\theta \approx \theta\)), the angles for the first and second minima are approximately:  
   \[
   \theta_1 \approx \frac{3.8317 \lambda}{a \pi}, \quad \theta_2 \approx \frac{7.0156 \lambda}{a \pi}.
   \]  
   The angular separation between the first two minima is:  
   \[
   \Delta\theta = \theta_2 - \theta_1 = \frac{(7.0156 - 3.8317) \lambda}{a \pi} \approx \frac{3.1839 \lambda}{a \pi}.
   \]  
   Numerically, this evaluates to approximately \(1.013 \lambda / a\). However, this value does not match any of the provided options.

2. **Single-Slit Approximation**:  
   If the polygon is treated as a single slit with width \(2a\) (since the apothem \(a\) is the distance from the center to a side), the diffraction minima occur at:  
   \[
   d \sin\theta = m \lambda, \quad m = 1, 2, 3, \dots
   \]  
   For a slit width \(d = 2a\), the first and second minima are at:  
   \[
   \theta_1 = \frac{\lambda}{2a}, \quad \theta_2 = \frac{2\lambda}{2a} = \frac{\lambda}{a}.
   \]  
   The angular separation between the first two minima is:  
   \[
   \Delta\theta = \theta_2 - \theta_1 = \frac{\lambda}{a} - \frac{\lambda}{2a} = \frac{\lambda}{2a}.
   \]  
   This corresponds to option B (\(0.500 \lambda / a\)).

3. **Critical Evaluation of Options**:  
   - **Option A (\(0.610 \lambda / a\))**: This value does not correspond to any standard diffraction pattern for a circular aperture or a single slit.  
   - **Option B (\(0.500 \lambda / a\))**: Matches the angular separation between the first two minima when the polygon is treated as a single slit with width \(2a\).  
   - **Option C (\(1.220 \lambda / a\))**: This is the angle of the first minimum for a circular aperture, not the angular separation between the first two minima.  
   - **Option D (\(0.506 \lambda / a\))**: Close to \(0.500 \lambda / a\), but slightly larger. It does not align with the calculated separation for either the circular aperture or the single-slit approximation.

### Conclusion:  
The problem likely assumes the polygon is approximated as a single slit with width \(2a\), leading to an angular separation of \(0.500 \lambda / a\). This matches option B.
