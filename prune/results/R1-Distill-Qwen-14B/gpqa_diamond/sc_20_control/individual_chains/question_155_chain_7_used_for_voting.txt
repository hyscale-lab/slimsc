Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem is about finding the uncertainty ΔPz of the operator Pz for a given quantum state. The state is provided as a column vector, and the operators Px, Py, and Pz are given in matrix form. 

First, let me recall what the uncertainty principle says. The uncertainty ΔPz is calculated using the formula ΔPz² = ⟨ψ| Pz² |ψ⟩ - ⟨ψ| Pz |ψ⟩². So I need to compute the expectation value of Pz and the expectation value of Pz squared.

The state of the system is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me write that down. So ψ is a 3-component vector:

ψ = [ -1/2 ]
      [ 1/√2 ]
      [ -1/2 ]

I should check if this vector is normalized. The sum of the squares of the magnitudes should be 1. Let's calculate:

| -1/2 |² = (1/2)^2 = 1/4
|1/√2 |² = 1/2
| -1/2 |² = 1/4
Adding them: 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = (1 + 2 + 1)/4 = 4/4 = 1. So yes, it's normalized. Good.

Now, the matrix for Pz is given as:

Pz = [
 [ ħ, 0, 0 ],
 [ 0, 0, 0 ],
 [ 0, 0, -ħ ]
]

So it's a diagonal matrix with diagonal entries ħ, 0, -ħ. 

First, let's compute ⟨Pz⟩, which is ψ† Pz ψ. Since Pz is diagonal, this should be straightforward.

Let me write out the components:

ψ = [ ψ₁, ψ₂, ψ₃ ] where ψ₁ = -1/2, ψ₂ = 1/√2, ψ₃ = -1/2.

So Pz ψ would be a vector where each component is multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element.

Pz ψ = [ ħ * ψ₁, 0 * ψ₂, (-ħ) * ψ₃ ]

So that's [ ħ*(-1/2), 0, (-ħ)*(-1/2) ] = [ -ħ/2, 0, ħ/2 ]

Now, ψ† is the conjugate transpose, but looking at the given ψ, the components are real, so ψ† is just [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

Then, the expectation value ⟨Pz⟩ is ψ† (Pz ψ) = ( -1/2 )*(-ħ/2) + (1/√2)*0 + ( -1/2 )*( ħ/2 )

Let's compute each term:

First term: (-1/2)(-ħ/2) = (ħ/4)
Second term: (1/√2)*0 = 0
Third term: (-1/2)( ħ/2 )= (-ħ/4 )

So adding them: ħ/4 + 0 - ħ/4 = 0. So ⟨Pz⟩ is zero.

Wait, that's interesting. The average of Pz is zero.

Next, I need to compute ⟨Pz²⟩. Let's compute Pz squared first. Since Pz is diagonal, squaring it just squares each diagonal element.

Pz² = [
 [ (ħ)^2, 0, 0 ],
 [ 0, 0, 0 ],
 [ 0, 0, (-ħ)^2 ]
] = [
 [ ħ², 0, 0 ],
 [ 0, 0, 0 ],
 [ 0, 0, ħ² ]
]

So Pz² ψ would be:

[ ħ² * ψ₁, 0 * ψ₂, ħ² * ψ₃ ]

Which is [ ħ²*(-1/2), 0, ħ²*(-1/2) ] = [ -ħ²/2, 0, -ħ²/2 ]

Then, the expectation value ⟨Pz²⟩ is ψ† (Pz² ψ) = ( -1/2 )* (-ħ²/2 ) + (1/√2)*0 + (-1/2)*(-ħ²/2 )

Calculating each term:

First term: (-1/2)*(-ħ²/2) = ħ²/4
Second term: 0
Third term: (-1/2)*(-ħ²/2) = ħ²/4

Adding them: ħ²/4 + 0 + ħ²/4 = ħ²/2

So now, I have ⟨Pz⟩ = 0 and ⟨Pz²⟩ = ħ²/2. 

The uncertainty ΔPz is the square root of (⟨Pz²⟩ - ⟨Pz⟩²). Since ⟨Pz⟩ is zero, it's just sqrt(⟨Pz²⟩).

So ΔPz = sqrt( ħ²/2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2 )

Looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2), which would be the answer.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculation. 

Wait, the state ψ is given as the eigenstate of Px with eigenvalue -ħ. So the state is ( -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ). 

Let me double-check the calculation of ⟨Pz⟩.

⟨Pz⟩ = ψ† Pz ψ 

Which is ψ₁ * (ħ * ψ₁) + ψ₂ * 0 * ψ₂ + ψ₃ * (-ħ) * ψ₃ 

Wait, no: that's not quite right. Because the way matrix multiplication works, when you multiply ψ† (row vector) with Pz ψ (which is a column vector), each element is ψ†_i multiplied by (Pz ψ)_i.

So ψ† is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]

Pz ψ is [ -ħ/2, 0, ħ/2 ]

So the inner product is (-1/2)(-ħ/2) + (1/√2)(0) + (-1/2)( ħ/2 )

Which is (ħ/4) + 0 + (- ħ/4) = 0. That's correct.

Then ⟨Pz^2⟩ is ψ† Pz² ψ.

Pz^2 is diagonal with entries ħ^2, 0, ħ^2. So Pz² ψ is [ ħ^2*(-1/2), 0, ħ^2*(-1/2) ]

Then ψ† times (Pz² ψ) is:

( -1/2 ) * ( - ħ²/2 ) + (1/√2)*0 + ( -1/2 )*( - ħ²/2 )

Which is ( ħ²/4 ) + 0 + ( ħ²/4 ) = ħ²/2 

So yes, the uncertainty is sqrt( ħ²/2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2 ), which is option B.

To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The matrix representation of $P_z$ is:

\[
P_z = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To compute $\langle P_z \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z \psi$, we first calculate $P_z \psi$:

\[
P_z \psi = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{\hbar}{2} \\ 0 \\ \frac{\hbar}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Now, compute $\psi^\dagger (P_z \psi)$:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{\hbar}{2} \\ 0 \\ \frac{\hbar}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)(0) + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{4} + 0 - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The matrix representation of $P_z^2$ is:

\[
P_z^2 = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z^2 \psi$, we first calculate $P_z^2 \psi$:

\[
P_z^2 \psi = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{\hbar^2}{2} \\ 0 \\ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Now, compute $\psi^\dagger (P_z^2 \psi)$:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{\hbar^2}{2} \\ 0 \\ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)(0) + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2}\right).
\]

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Since $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$, we have:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to **Option B**.
