Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs due to Einstein's theory of relativity. Right, the faster you go, the slower your time passes relative to someone not moving at that speed. 

The question says that these aliens have a spacecraft moving at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. That's super fast, almost the speed of light. The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find out how long it takes for them to reach Earth from their own perspective. 

Wait, wait. The problem says to find the time from the astronaut's point of view. So that's the proper time, right? Because proper time is the time measured in the moving frame of reference. Oh, right, because the astronaut is on the spacecraft, so their own clock is the proper time.

But wait, how do I calculate the proper time? I think the formula involves the Lorentz factor gamma. Gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So gamma equals 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

Given that v is 0.99999987 c, let's plug that in. Let me compute v²/c² first. So (0.99999987)^2 is roughly (since it's so close to 1) approximately 1, but let me be more precise. Let me calculate 1 minus v²/c². 

Let me approximate. Let me denote v = c * (1 - ε), where ε is a very small number. Wait, 0.99999987 is c*(1 - 0.00000013/0.99999987). Wait, maybe that's not the easiest approach. Alternatively, let me compute 0.99999987^2. Let's see:

0.99999987 squared is (1 - 1.3e-7)^2. So expanding that, it's 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2. The (1.3e-7)^2 is negligible, so approximately 1 - 2.6e-7. So 1 - v²/c² is approximately 2.6e-7.

So gamma is 1 / sqrt(2.6e-7). Let me compute sqrt(2.6e-7). The square root of 2.6 is about 1.612, and sqrt(1e-7) is 1e-3.5, which is 3.16e-4, since sqrt(1e-6)=1e-3, and sqrt(1e-7) is a bit less. Wait, 1e-7 is 0.0000001. Its square root is 0.00003162... So sqrt(2.6e-7) is approx 1.612 * 0.00003162 = approximately 5.088e-5.

So gamma is 1 divided by 5.088e-5. Let me compute that: 1 / 5.088e-5 is about 19682. Wait, because 5e-5 is 0.00005, and 1/0.00005 is 20000. So 5.088e-5 is a bit less than 0.00005, so 1 divided by it should be a bit more than 20000. Let me compute 1/5.088e-5.

Calculate 5.088e-5 = 0.00005088. So 1 / 0.00005088 ≈ 19673. Hmm, so gamma is approximately 19673. That's a huge gamma factor because the speed is so close to c.

But wait, the problem is about the time experienced by the astronaut, which is the proper time. The proper time is the shortest time and is the time measured in the moving frame. The formula for proper time tau is tau = t' = t / gamma, where t is the time measured in the Earth's frame. Wait, no, wait. I might have that reversed. Let me think again.

Wait, the Earth's frame is the rest frame of Earth, and the spacecraft is moving at velocity v relative to Earth. So from Earth's perspective, the spacecraft takes some time t to reach Earth, and the astronaut's own clock (proper time) is tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Because tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) because tau is the proper time. Alternatively, tau = t / gamma, since gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So tau = t / gamma.

But wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. The time experienced by the astronaut (tau) is the proper time, which is less than the time in Earth's frame. So from Earth's perspective, the distance is D (say, distance to Earth, but wait, Earth is moving towards the spacecraft, but in this case, perhaps the Earth is at rest, and the spacecraft is moving towards it. Let me assume that the Earth is at rest in its own frame.)

Wait, the problem says the spacecraft is traveling at 0.99999987 c towards Earth. So from Earth's frame, the distance is let's say L, and the spacecraft's speed is v, so the time t is L / v. Then, the astronaut's proper time is tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = t / gamma.

But wait, the problem doesn't give the distance. Oh wait, wait the problem says that the astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find how old they will be when they reach Earth from their own perspective.

Wait, but the question doesn't specify the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. Oh, right, because the Large Magellanic Cloud is a galaxy about 160,000 light-years away from Earth. Oh, so the distance is about 160,000 light-years. So L is approximately 160,000 ly.

Wait, but the problem says "the average lifetime of these aliens is roughly 150 solar years." Hmm, that's the average lifetime, so the astronaut is 22 now, so from their own perspective, they have about 128 years left (150-22=128?), but that's probably not relevant unless they don't make it.

Wait, but the question is about how long it takes from their perspective. So the proper time tau is what matters.

So first, let's compute the time from Earth's frame. Time t = L / v. L is 160,000 ly, v is 0.99999987 c. So t = (160,000 ly) / (0.99999987 c). Since 1 ly is the distance light travels in a year, and v is in terms of c, so the unit works out.

t = (160,000 / 0.99999987) years.

Hmm, 160,000 divided by approx 1 is 160,000 years. But since 0.99999987 is just a bit less than 1, the denominator is a bit less than 1, so the division makes it a bit larger. Let me compute 160,000 / 0.99999987.

Let me compute 0.99999987 is 1 - 1.3e-7. So 160,000 / (1 - 1.3e-7) ≈ 160,000 * (1 + 1.3e-7) using the approximation 1/(1 - x) ≈ 1 +x for small x.

So 160,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ 160,000 + 160,000 * 1.3e-7. 160,000 * 1.3e-7 = 160,000 * 0.00000013 = 0.0208. So t ≈ 160,000 + 0.0208 ≈ 160,000.0208 years. So from Earth's frame, it takes roughly 160,000 years. That's a long time, but the astronaut is only 22 years old, and their average lifetime is 150 years. So if the trip takes 160,000 years from Earth's perspective, the astronaut would be way beyond their lifespan. But wait, but from the astronaut's perspective, the time is shorter because of time dilation.

Wait, but the astronaut's own time is tau = t / gamma. Since gamma is about 19673, as I computed earlier. So tau = 160,000.02 / 19673 ≈ Let me compute that.

160,000 / 19,673 ≈ Let's see: 19,673 * 8 = 157,384. 19,673 *8.1 = 157,384 + 19,673*0.1=1,967.3 → 159,351.3. 19,673 *8.14 ≈ 159,351.3 + 19,673*0.04=787 → 160,138.3. That's a bit higher than 160,000. So 8.14 would be 160,138, which is slightly over. So 8.14 years? Hmm, but wait, I'm doing 160,000 /19673. Oh wait, 19673 is about 2e4, so 160,000 / 2e4 is 8. So 8 years approximately.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, 19673 is 1.9673e4. So 160,000 /1.9673e4 = (160,000) / (19,673) ≈ 8.12 years. So the astronaut would experience roughly 8 years of time. So they would be 22 +8 =30 years old when they reach Earth. 

But wait, the options don't have 8 years. The options are 72, 77, 81 years, or the astronaut dies before reaching. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the gamma value. Let me recalculate gamma.

v = 0.99999987 c.

v²/c² = (0.99999987)^2 = (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*1.3e-7 = 1 - 2.6e-7. So 1 - v²/c² = 2.6e-7.

So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is sqrt(2.6e-7) = sqrt(2.6)*sqrt(1e-7) → sqrt(2.6) is about 1.612, sqrt(1e-7)=1e-3.5= approx 3.16e-4. So 1.612 *3.16e-4 ≈ 5.08e-4.

So gamma is 1 / (5.08e-4) = approx 1968. So gamma is approximately 1968.

Ah, wait, earlier I thought gamma was 19673, but that's incorrect. Wait, no. Wait, 5.08e-4 is 0.000508. So 1 divided by 0.000508 is about 1968. So gamma is about 1968. 

So now, tau = t / gamma = 160,000 years / 1968 ≈ 81.2 years. Wait, that makes sense. So the astronaut's experienced time is about 81 years. So 22 +81=103 years old upon arrival. But the average lifetime is 150 years, so they would make it. 

But wait, from Earth's frame, the trip takes about 160,000 years, but from the astronaut's frame, it's about 81 years. So the astronaut would be 22 +81=103 years old, which is within their 150-year lifespan. So the answer would be about 81 years, which is option C.

Wait, but wait another thing. The problem says the astronaut is 22 years old, so their time experienced is 81 years. So their age upon arrival is 22 +81=103, which is less than 150, so they live. So the correct answer is 81 years. So option C is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the time more accurately. Let's compute gamma more precisely.

Compute v² = (0.99999987 c)^2 = (0.99999987)^2 c². Let me compute 0.99999987 squared. 

(0.99999987)^2 = (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 = 1 - 2*1.3e-7 + (1.3e-7)^2. The last term is negligible. So it's approximately 1 - 2.6e-7.

So 1 - v²/c² = 2.6e-7.

sqrt(2.6e-7) = sqrt(2.6) * sqrt(1e-7) = approx 1.612 * 3.162e-4 = 1.612 * 3.162e-4. Let me compute 1.612 *3.162 = approximately 5.088. So 5.088e-4. So gamma is 1 / 5.088e-4 = approximately 1967. So gamma is about 1967.

Wait, 5.088e-4 is 0.0005088. 1/0.0005088 is approximately 1967. So gamma ≈ 1967.

So t (from Earth) is L /v. L is 160,000 ly. v is 0.99999987 c. So t = (160,000 ly) / (0.99999987 c). But 1 ly is the distance light travels in a year, so when you divide ly by c, you get years. So t = 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 * (1 + 1.3e-7) ≈ 160,000 + 0.0208 ≈ 160,000.0208 years.

So tau = t / gamma = 160,000.0208 / 1967 ≈ Let's compute that.

160,000 / 1967 ≈ 81.25 years. So about 81 years. That's exactly option C. So the correct answer is C) 81 years.

To determine how long it will take for the astronaut to reach Earth from their perspective, we need to account for time dilation due to the spacecraft's velocity, which is 0.99999987$c$. The proper time $\tau$ experienced by the astronaut is related to the time $t$ measured in Earth's frame by the Lorentz factor $\gamma$:

\[
\tau = \frac{t}{\gamma}, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}.
\]

### Step 1: Calculate $\gamma$
The velocity $v = 0.99999987c$. First, compute $v^2/c^2$:
\[
v^2/c^2 = (0.99999987)^2 \approx 1 - 2.6 \times 10^{-7}.
\]
Thus:
\[
1 - v^2/c^2 \approx 2.6 \times 10^{-7}.
\]
Now calculate $\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}$:
\[
\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} \approx \sqrt{2.6 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 5.088 \times 10^{-4}.
\]
Finally, compute $\gamma$:
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \approx \frac{1}{5.088 \times 10^{-4}} \approx 1967.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate $t$ (time in Earth's frame)
The distance to Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud is approximately $160,000$ light-years. The time $t$ for the spacecraft to travel this distance, as measured in Earth's frame, is:
\[
t = \frac{L}{v} = \frac{160,000 \, \text{ly}}{0.99999987c}.
\]
Since $1 \, \text{ly} / c = 1 \, \text{year}$, this simplifies to:
\[
t \approx \frac{160,000}{0.99999987} \approx 160,000.0208 \, \text{years}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate $\tau$ (proper time for the astronaut)
The proper time experienced by the astronaut is:
\[
\tau = \frac{t}{\gamma} = \frac{160,000.0208}{1967} \approx 81.2 \, \text{years}.
\]

### Step 4: Verify the astronaut's survival
The astronaut is initially 22 years old, and their average lifetime is 150 years. Upon reaching Earth, the astronaut would be $22 + 81 = 103$ years old, which is within their expected lifespan. Therefore, the astronaut will survive the journey.

### Final Answer:
The time experienced by the astronaut is approximately **81 years**, which corresponds to option **C**.

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs due to Einstein's theory of relativity. Right, the faster you go, the slower your time passes relative to someone not moving at that speed. 

The question says that these aliens have a spacecraft moving at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. That's super fast, almost the speed of light. The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find out how long it takes for them to reach Earth from their own perspective. 

Wait, wait. The problem says to find the time from the astronaut's point of view. So that's the proper time, right? Because proper time is the time measured in the moving frame of reference. Oh, right, because the astronaut is on the spacecraft, so their own clock is the proper time.

But wait, how do I calculate the proper time? I think the formula involves the Lorentz factor gamma. Gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So gamma equals 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

Given that v is 0.99999987 c, let's plug that in. Let me compute v²/c² first. So (0.99999987)^2 is roughly (since it's so close to 1) approximately 1, but let me be more precise. Let me calculate 1 minus v²/c². 

Let me approximate. Let me denote v = c * (1 - ε), where ε is a very small number. Wait, 0.99999987 is c*(1 - 0.00000013/0.99999987). Wait, maybe that's not the easiest approach. Alternatively, let me compute 0.99999987^2. Let's see:

0.99999987 squared is (1 - 1.3e-7)^2. So expanding that, it's 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2. The (1.3e-7)^2 is negligible, so approximately 1 - 2.6e-7. So 1 - v²/c² is approximately 2.6e-7.

So gamma is 1 / sqrt(2.6e-7). Let me compute sqrt(2.6e-7). The square root of 2.6 is about 1.612, and sqrt(1e-7) is 1e-3.5, which is 3.16e-4, since sqrt(1e-6)=1e-3, and sqrt(1e-7) is a bit less. Wait, 1e-7 is 0.0000001. Its square root is 0.00003162... So sqrt(2.6e-7) is approx 1.612 * 0.00003162 = approximately 5.088e-5.

So gamma is 1 divided by 5.088e-5. Let me compute that: 1 / 5.088e-5 is about 19682. Wait, because 5e-5 is 0.00005, and 1/0.00005 is 20000. So 5.088e-5 is a bit less than 0.00005, so 1 divided by it should be a bit more than 20000. Let me compute 1/5.088e-5.

Calculate 5.088e-5 = 0.00005088. So 1 / 0.00005088 ≈ 19673. Hmm, so gamma is approximately 19673. That's a huge gamma factor because the speed is so close to c.

But wait, the problem is about the time experienced by the astronaut, which is the proper time. The proper time is the shortest time and is the time measured in the moving frame. The formula for proper time tau is tau = t' = t / gamma, where t is the time measured in the Earth's frame. Wait, no, wait. I might have that reversed. Let me think again.

Wait, the Earth's frame is the rest frame of Earth, and the spacecraft is moving at velocity v relative to Earth. So from Earth's perspective, the spacecraft takes some time t to reach Earth, and the astronaut's own clock (proper time) is tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Because tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) because tau is the proper time. Alternatively, tau = t / gamma, since gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So tau = t / gamma.

But wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. The time experienced by the astronaut (tau) is the proper time, which is less than the time in Earth's frame. So from Earth's perspective, the distance is D (say, distance to Earth, but wait, Earth is moving towards the spacecraft, but in this case, perhaps the Earth is at rest, and the spacecraft is moving towards it. Let me assume that the Earth is at rest in its own frame.)

Wait, the problem says the spacecraft is traveling at 0.99999987 c towards Earth. So from Earth's frame, the distance is let's say L, and the spacecraft's speed is v, so the time t is L / v. Then, the astronaut's proper time is tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = t / gamma.

But wait, the problem doesn't give the distance. Oh wait, wait the problem says that the astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find how old they will be when they reach Earth from their own perspective.

Wait, but the question doesn't specify the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. Oh, right, because the Large Magellanic Cloud is a galaxy about 160,000 light-years away from Earth. Oh, so the distance is about 160,000 light-years. So L is approximately 160,000 ly.

Wait, but the problem says "the average lifetime of these aliens is roughly 150 solar years." Hmm, that's the average lifetime, so the astronaut is 22 now, so from their own perspective, they have about 128 years left (150-22=128?), but that's probably not relevant unless they don't make it.

Wait, but the question is about how long it takes from their perspective. So the proper time tau is what matters.

So first, let's compute the time from Earth's frame. Time t = L / v. L is 160,000 ly, v is 0.99999987 c. So t = (160,000 ly) / (0.99999987 c). Since 1 ly is the distance light travels in a year, and v is in terms of c, so the unit works out.

t = (160,000 / 0.99999987) years.

Hmm, 160,000 divided by approx 1 is 160,000 years. But since 0.99999987 is just a bit less than 1, the denominator is a bit less than 1, so the division makes it a bit larger. Let me compute 160,000 / 0.99999987.

Let me compute 0.99999987 is 1 - 1.3e-7. So 160,000 / (1 - 1.3e-7) ≈ 160,000 * (1 + 1.3e-7) using the approximation 1/(1 - x) ≈ 1 +x for small x.

So 160,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ 160,000 + 160,000 * 1.3e-7. 160,000 * 1.3e-7 = 160,000 * 0.00000013 = 0.0208. So t ≈ 160,000 + 0.0208 ≈ 160,000.0208 years. So from Earth's frame, it takes roughly 160,000 years. That's a long time, but the astronaut is only 22 years old, and their average lifetime is 150 years. So if the trip takes 160,000 years from Earth's perspective, the astronaut would be way beyond their lifespan. But wait, but from the astronaut's perspective, the time is shorter because of time dilation.

Wait, but the astronaut's own time is tau = t / gamma. Since gamma is about 19673, as I computed earlier. So tau = 160,000.02 / 19673 ≈ Let me compute that.

160,000 / 19,673 ≈ Let's see: 19,673 * 8 = 157,384. 19,673 *8.1 = 157,384 + 19,673*0.1=1,967.3 → 159,351.3. 19,673 *8.14 ≈ 159,351.3 + 19,673*0.04=787 → 160,138.3. That's a bit higher than 160,000. So 8.14 would be 160,138, which is slightly over. So 8.14 years? Hmm, but wait, I'm doing 160,000 /19673. Oh wait, 19673 is about 2e4, so 160,000 / 2e4 is 8. So 8 years approximately.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, 19673 is 1.9673e4. So 160,000 /1.9673e4 = (160,000) / (19,673) ≈ 8.12 years. So the astronaut would experience roughly 8 years of time. So they would be 22 +8 =30 years old when they reach Earth. 

But wait, the options don't have 8 years. The options are 72, 77, 81 years, or the astronaut dies before reaching. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the gamma value. Let me recalculate gamma.

v = 0.99999987 c.

v²/c² = (0.99999987)^2 = (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*1.3e-7 = 1 - 2.6e-7. So 1 - v²/c² = 2.6e-7.

So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is sqrt(2.6e-7) = sqrt(2.6)*sqrt(1e-7) → sqrt(2.6) is about 1.612, sqrt(1e-7)=1e-3.5= approx 3.16e-4. So 1.612 *3.16e-4 ≈ 5.08e-4.

So gamma is 1 / (5.08e-4) = approx 1968. So gamma is approximately 1968.

Ah, wait, earlier I thought gamma was 19673, but that's incorrect. Wait, no. Wait, 5.08e-4 is 0.000508. So 1 divided by 0.000508 is about 1968. So gamma is about 1968. 

So now, tau = t / gamma = 160,000 years / 1968 ≈ 81.2 years. Wait, that makes sense. So the astronaut's experienced time is about 81 years. So 22 +81=103 years old upon arrival. But the average lifetime is 150 years, so they would make it. 

But wait, from Earth's frame, the trip takes about 160,000 years, but from the astronaut's frame, it's about 81 years. So the astronaut would be 22 +81=103 years old, which is within their 150-year lifespan. So the answer would be about 81 years, which is option C.

Wait, but wait another thing. The problem says the astronaut is 22 years old, so their time experienced is 81 years. So their age upon arrival is 22 +81=103, which is less than 150, so they live. So the correct answer is 81 years. So option C is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the time more accurately. Let's compute gamma more precisely.

Compute v² = (0.99999987 c)^2 = (0.99999987)^2 c². Let me compute 0.99999987 squared. 

(0.99999987)^2 = (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 = 1 - 2*1.3e-7 + (1.3e-7)^2. The last term is negligible. So it's approximately 1 - 2.6e-7.

So 1 - v²/c² = 2.6e-7.

sqrt(2.6e-7) = sqrt(2.6) * sqrt(1e-7) = approx 1.612 * 3.162e-4 = 1.612 * 3.162e-4. Let me compute 1.612 *3.162 = approximately 5.088. So 5.088e-4. So gamma is 1 / 5.088e-4 = approximately 1967. So gamma is about 1967.

Wait, 5.088e-4 is 0.0005088. 1/0.0005088 is approximately 1967. So gamma ≈ 1967.

So t (from Earth) is L /v. L is 160,000 ly. v is 0.99999987 c. So t = (160,000 ly) / (0.99999987 c). But 1 ly is the distance light travels in a year, so when you divide ly by c, you get years. So t = 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 * (1 + 1.3e-7) ≈ 160,000 + 0.0208 ≈ 160,000.0208 years.

So tau = t / gamma = 160,000.0208 / 1967 ≈ Let's compute that.

160,000 / 1967 ≈ 81.25 years. So about 81 years. That's exactly option C. So the correct answer is C) 81 years.


To determine how long it will take for the astronaut to reach Earth from their perspective, we need to account for time dilation due to the spacecraft's velocity, which is 0.99999987$c$. The proper time $\tau$ experienced by the astronaut is related to the time $t$ measured in Earth's frame by the Lorentz factor $\gamma$:

\[
\tau = \frac{t}{\gamma}, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}.
\]

### Step 1: Calculate $\gamma$
The velocity $v = 0.99999987c$. First, compute $v^2/c^2$:
\[
v^2/c^2 = (0.99999987)^2 \approx 1 - 2.6 \times 10^{-7}.
\]
Thus:
\[
1 - v^2/c^2 \approx 2.6 \times 10^{-7}.
\]
Now calculate $\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}$:
\[
\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} \approx \sqrt{2.6 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 5.088 \times 10^{-4}.
\]
Finally, compute $\gamma$:
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \approx \frac{1}{5.088 \times 10^{-4}} \approx 1967.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate $t$ (time in Earth's frame)
The distance to Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud is approximately $160,000$ light-years. The time $t$ for the spacecraft to travel this distance, as measured in Earth's frame, is:
\[
t = \frac{L}{v} = \frac{160,000 \, \text{ly}}{0.99999987c}.
\]
Since $1 \, \text{ly} / c = 1 \, \text{year}$, this simplifies to:
\[
t \approx \frac{160,000}{0.99999987} \approx 160,000.0208 \, \text{years}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate $\tau$ (proper time for the astronaut)
The proper time experienced by the astronaut is:
\[
\tau = \frac{t}{\gamma} = \frac{160,000.0208}{1967} \approx 81.2 \, \text{years}.
\]

### Step 4: Verify the astronaut's survival
The astronaut is initially 22 years old, and their average lifetime is 150 years. Upon reaching Earth, the astronaut would be $22 + 81 = 103$ years old, which is within their expected lifespan. Therefore, the astronaut will survive the journey.

### Final Answer:
The time experienced by the astronaut is approximately **81 years**, which corresponds to option **C**.
