Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here about the hydrogen atom. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. I remember that in such transitions, certain selection rules apply.

Hmm, the selection rules for electric dipole transitions in hydrogen... I think the main ones are Δl = ±1 for the orbital angular momentum, and Δm can be 0, ±1. Also, the transition is allowed only if the final state has these changes. So, the initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0.

First transition: from n=3 to a lower n, but l must increase by 1. So l was 0, so after the first transition, l becomes 1. So the first step is to go from |3,0,0⟩ to something with l=1. Like n=2, l=1. Because n has to decrease by 1 in this case, but wait, no, n can change by any number as long as the other selection rules are met, right? Wait, no, the selection rule for n is different. Oh wait, no, I think the electric dipole selection rule for n is Δn = ±1, but wait no, that's not right. Wait, no, I'm confusing with the selection rules in other contexts. Oh no, wait, the standard electric dipole selection rules in hydrogen are: Δl = ±1 (excluding l=0 to l=0), and for m, Δm = 0, ±1.

Wait, wait, no. I think for each transition, the selection rules are applied. So each dipole transition must follow Δl = ±1, but in this question, the state decays via two dipole transitions. So from 3,0,0 to some intermediate state, then to 1,0,0.

Let me think. The initial state is n=3, l=0. The final state is n=1, l=0. So we have to have two transitions. Each transition must follow the selection rules.

First transition: from n=3, l=0 to some state with higher or lower l. Since from l=0, the next possible is l=1. So the first transition must go to l=1. So the intermediate state must have l=1. What possible n can it have? Well, for the first transition, any n allowed as long as l changes by ±1. But since the initial state is n=3, l=0, the first step could be to n=2, l=1 because Δn can be anything as long as Δl=±1. Hmm, wait, no, wait. Wait, the selection rule isn't directly on Δn; Δn can be any as long as you have a dipole transition, but in practice, the energy levels are such that transitions happen between adjacent n levels. Wait, no, that's more about which transitions are more probable. For dipole transitions, l must change by ±1, but n can change by any amount as long as l is changing. But in reality, for hydrogen, transitions usually happen between adjacent shells because the energy difference is suitable. But the problem doesn't specify that; it just says via two dipole transitions.

So first transition: from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩, where m can be 0, ±1. Because Δm can be 0, ±1.

Then the second transition goes from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩.

Wait, but wait, the final state is |1,0,0⟩. So for the second transition, the initial state is |2,1,m⟩, and the final is |1,0,0⟩.

So let's apply the selection rules for the second transition.

In the second transition, l is going from 1 to 0. So Δl = -1, which is allowed. So that's fine.

Now, the m values: in the intermediate state, m is something, and in the final state m is 0.

So Δm can be 0, ±1. But the initial state's m is m', and the final is 0. So m' can be -1, 0, or +1.

Wait, let's think about how the transitions happen. Each transition can change m by 0, +1, or -1.

So for the first transition: m starts at 0. So the possible m values after first transition are m=0, +1, or -1. So the intermediate state could be |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, or |2,1,-1⟩.

Then, in the second transition from the intermediate state to |1,0,0⟩, the m must go from m' to 0. So for each possible m', what are the possible changes?

Case 1: Intermediate state is |2,1,0⟩. Then m needs to change by 0. So the second transition can do that.

Case 2: Intermediate state is |2,1,1⟩. Then m must change by -1 to get to 0.

Case 3: Intermediate state is |2,1,-1⟩. Then m must change by +1 to get to 0.

So all three possibilities are allowed. But now, the question is about the probabilities.

Wait, but the question says the transition route and the corresponding probability. The options are giving specific routes and probabilities.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Goes through |2,1,0⟩ and has probability 1/3.

Option B: Goes through |2,1,1⟩, probability 1/4.

Option C: Goes through |2,1,-1⟩, probability 1/4.

Option D: Goes through |2,1,0⟩, and probability 2/3. Wait, but option D doesn't have a state after the first step. Wait, looking at the options, option D says something like |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 2/3. So that's a possible route.

But I need to think about the possible probabilities for each possible path. The probability for each transition depends on the matrix elements of the dipole operator between the states. The total probability would be the sum of the probabilities of each possible path.

Wait, but the question says the transition decays via two dipole transitions. So the entire process is two steps, each dipole.

Each transition has a certain probability, and the overall probability is the product of the two probabilities for each step. So for each possible intermediate state, we'd calculate the product of the first transition's probability and the second transition's probability, then sum over all possible intermediates.

But I'm not exactly sure about the specific probabilities. Alternatively, perhaps the selection rules and the possible m values determine which options are possible. Let's think about allowed transitions.

Each step must have Δm = 0, ±1. So the first transition from m=0 to m=0, +1, or -1.

Then, the second transition must take m from whatever it was to 0. So the second transition's Δm can be 0, ±1.

So, if the first transition ends at m=0, the second transition can stay at m=0, but wait, no, because the final state's m is 0, so the second transition must go from m_i to 0.

Wait, in the second transition, the initial m is m_i, and the final is 0. So Δm = 0 - m_i. So for each possible m_i, what is allowed?

If m_i is 0, then Δm =0, which is allowed. If m_i is +1, then Δm = -1, which is allowed. If m_i is -1, then Δm = +1, which is allowed. So all three are possible.

So all three intermediate states (m=0, +1, -1) are possible. So the total probability would be the sum of the probabilities of each possible two-step path.

But the options list specific paths and their probabilities. So each option's transition path is a specific two-step sequence, and each has its own probability.

But wait, the options state the overall probability for each route. So for each option, what is the probability of that specific route?

But the question is, which option is correct?

Let me think about the possible paths.

Option A: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/3.

Option B: → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/4.

Option C: → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, probability 1/4.

Option D: → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, with probability 2/3.

Wait, but the sum of probabilities for all possible paths must be 1 (if all paths are considered), but the options don't present that. Alternatively, perhaps the question is only considering a specific two-step path, and the probability given is for that path.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the possible allowed transitions and the number of possible paths.

But perhaps I should think about the possible allowed m transitions in each step.

Wait, another approach: The initial state is |3,0,0⟩. The final state is |1,0,0⟩. The transition requires two steps, each a dipole transition.

Each dipole transition can cause a change in m of 0, +1, or -1.

So, the first transition can take m from 0 to 0, +1, or -1.

The second transition must take m from whatever it was after the first step to 0.

So, from the first step, possible m values after step 1 are 0, +1, -1.

For each, the second step must change m to 0.

So, for each possible intermediate m:

If m after step 1 is 0, then step 2 can have Δm=0 (so m remains 0).

If m is +1, step 2 must have Δm=-1.

If m is -1, step 2 must have Δm=+1.

Each of these is allowed.

Now, the overall number of possible paths is the sum of the probabilities for each possible m path.

But perhaps the probabilities are determined by the square of the dipole matrix elements, but that's complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of allowed m transitions determines the relative probabilities.

Wait, each dipole transition can change m by 0, +1, or -1. So for each step, there are three possibilities for m.

But the first step starts at m=0, so possible m's after first step are 0, +1, -1.

The second step goes to m=0. So for each of the three possible m's after the first step, there's one allowed transition in the second step.

So, the total number of possible two-step paths is 3 (from first step) × 1 (each leads to one way in second step) = 3 paths.

But the question is about the possible transition routes and their probabilities. The possible routes are the three possible intermediates, each leading to the final state.

But the options A, B, C, D don't present all three routes; each option is a single route. So perhaps the probabilities in the options are the probabilities for each individual route.

But how do we calculate the probabilities for each route?

Wait, the probability for a transition is proportional to the square of the matrix element. But in hydrogen, transitions are also forbidden if the integral of the dipole operator between the initial and final states is zero.

But perhaps the probability is determined by the number of allowed m transitions.

Wait, but I'm not exactly remembering the exact probabilities. Alternatively, perhaps the probabilities are determined by the number of possible ways the m can change.

But perhaps let's think in terms of angular momentum. The dipole operator has components along x, y, z. The transition probabilities are given by the squares of the matrix elements for each component.

Wait, the dipole operator is proportional to r times the spherical harmonics Y_{1,m}, where m can be -1, 0, +1.

So the transition from |n, l, m⟩ to |n', l', m'⟩ is allowed only if m' = m + m_dipole, where m_dipole is -1, 0, +1.

So for the first transition, |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1, m1⟩. So m1 can be 0, +1, -1.

The probability for each m1 is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element for that transition.

Similarly, the second transition is |2,1, m1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩. So m1 must be such that 0 = m1 + m_dipole_second. So m_dipole_second = -m1.

Wait, no: the dipole operator in the second transition would cause a change in m by its own m, so m_final = m_initial + m_dipole.

Wait, in the first step: initial m is 0. So m1 can be 0 + m_dipole (where m_dipole is -1, 0, +1).

In the second step: initial m is m1, final m is 0. So 0 = m1 + m_dipole_second → m_dipole_second = -m1.

So, for the first step, each m1 has a probability proportional to |⟨2,1,m1| e r |3,0,0⟩|².

Similarly, for the second step, each transition has a probability proportional to |⟨1,0,0| e r |2,1,m1⟩|².

But I don't remember the exact expressions for these matrix elements. However, I think that the matrix elements are non-zero only when the angular momentum conditions are met, which we've already considered.

But perhaps the key point is that the probability for each path is the product of the probabilities of each step.

But let's think about the possible m1 values and their corresponding probabilities.

Wait, for the first transition from |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m1⟩, the possible m1 are 0, +1, -1. Each of these would have a certain probability.

The probability for each m1 is determined by the square of the matrix element.

In hydrogen, the dipole transitions' matrix elements depend on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which involve the Wigner 3-j symbols or spherical harmonics integrals.

Alternatively, perhaps the probabilities are the same for each allowed m, but I'm not sure. Another approach: the possible transitions for each step.

In the first step: when going from l=0 (s orbital) to l=1 (p orbital), the possible m1 are 0, +1, -1.

The dipole operator has components in each of these m directions. So each would have a certain weight.

Wait, from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,0⟩: the transition is caused by the dipole operator's m=0 component. Similarly, for the m=+1 and m=-1 transitions.

The probabilities for each transition could be different. But without knowing the exact matrix elements, perhaps we can think in terms of symmetry.

Wait, for the first transition, the matrix element for m=0 is perhaps the same as for m=+1 and m=-1. Or perhaps it's larger. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition probabilities for each m are proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which for the initial state being l=0, m=0.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for coupling l=0 and l'=1 would be non-zero only for certain m transitions.

Wait, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient ⟨ l', m' | l, m ⟩ is non-zero only when m' = m + m_dipole.

Wait, perhaps the probability for each m1 is proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for that m.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding angular momenta. Wait, but in this case, the initial state is |3,0,0⟩, and the transition is to |2,1,m1⟩.

Wait, actually, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are for combining two angular momenta. Hmm, maybe it's more complicated than that. Alternatively, perhaps the matrix elements for the dipole transitions depend on the overlap of the initial and final angular momentum states.

Alternatively, perhaps the selection rules for the dipole transitions are such that the transitions are possible only for certain m changes, but all that is considered.

Wait, perhaps the probability for each m1 is the same. So in the first transition, each of the three possible m1 states (0, +1, -1) has an equal probability. Then, the second transition would have some probabilities depending on m1.

Wait, but for the second transition, which goes from |2,1,m1⟩ to |1,0,0⟩, the matrix elements would depend on m1.

Hmm, perhaps the probabilities for the second step are not the same for all m1.

Alternatively, another approach: in the non-relativistic hydrogen atom, the transition probabilities can be calculated using Fermi's Golden Rule or using the matrix elements.

The transition probability is proportional to the square of the matrix element ⟨ final | r | initial ⟩.

The dipole operator is proportional to r. So, the transition from |n_i, l_i, m_i⟩ to |n_f, l_f, m_f⟩ is allowed only if l_i and l_f differ by 1, and |m_i - m_f| ≤1.

But the probability amplitude for each transition is given by the integral:

⟨n_f l_f m_f | r |n_i l_i m_i⟩.

In hydrogen, this can be expressed in terms of the spherical harmonics and radial wavefunctions.

But for the purposes of this question, perhaps the key point is that the transition probabilities depend on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients and the overlap of the radial wavefunctions.

In the first step, from n=3, l=0 to n=2, l=1, the radial integral is proportional to the square of the wavefunction overlap times the angular integral.

Wait, but the angular integral for the transition from l=0 to l=1 is non-zero only for certain m transitions. So, perhaps each m1 (0, +1, -1) has a certain angular integral value.

The angular integral is ∫ Y_{1, m1}^* Y_{0,0} Y_{1,0} dΩ. Wait, no, perhaps it's ∫ Y_{1, m1}^* r · Y_{0,0} Y_{1,0} dΩ? Not quite sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the expansion of the dipole operator in terms of spherical harmonics.

The dipole moment operator is given by:

r = r (Y_{1, -1}, Y_{1,0}, Y_{1,1} ), so it has three components along x, y, z.

Each component corresponds to a different m change.

So, the transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m1⟩ is governed by the component of the dipole operator with m = m1.

So, the matrix element for each m1 is proportional to the integral of Y_{1, m1}^* Y_{0,0} Y_{1,0} multiplied by the radial part.

Wait, no, more precisely, the dipole operator's angular part is proportional to Y_{1, m_dipole}, so the matrix element is:

⟨2,1,m1 | Y_{1, m_dipole} |3,0,0⟩.

Which is the integral of Y_{1, m1}^* Y_{1, m_dipole} Y_{0,0}.

Because the initial state is l=0 (Y_{0,0}), and the operator has l=1, so the product Y_{1, m_dipole} Y_{0,0} would be expressed in terms of spherical harmonics of higher l.

But since the initial state is l=0, the integral over angles would be zero unless the product Y_{1, m_dipole} Y_{0,0} has an l=1 component.

Wait, the integral becomes:

∫ Y_{1, m1}^* Y_{1, m_dipole} Y_{0,0} dΩ.

But Y_{0,0} is a constant (1/(sqrt(4π))), so:

(1/(sqrt(4π))) ∫ Y_{1, m1}^* Y_{1, m_dipole} dΩ.

This is the integral of the product of three spherical harmonics. The integral is non-zero only if certain conditions are met. Specifically, the integral ∫ Y_{l1 m1} Y_{l2 m2} Y_{l3 m3} dΩ is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient ⟨ l1, m1; l2, m2 | l3, m3 ⟩ multiplied by some factors.

In this case, l1=1, m1= m1.

l2=1, m2= m_dipole.

l3=0, m3=0.

Wait, no: the initial state is l=0, so the product Y_{1, m_dipole} Y_{0,0} must produce a component of l=1. Because the operator is l=1.

But wait, the product of Y_{1, m_dipole} and Y_{0,0} can be expressed as a sum over l=1 (since 1 +0 ≥1 and ≤1+0=1). So the product is proportional to Y_{1, m_dipole}.

Wait, perhaps the integral simplifies because Y_{0,0} is 1/(sqrt(4π)), so the integral becomes (1/(sqrt(4π))) ∫ Y_{1, m1}^* Y_{1, m_dipole} dΩ.

Which is (1/(sqrt(4π))) times the integral of Y_{1, m1}^* Y_{1, m_dipole} over all angles.

But the integral of Y_{a}^* Y_{b} is zero unless a = b. So this integral is zero unless m1 = m_dipole.

Because the integral of Y_{1, m1}^* Y_{1, m_dipole} is zero unless m1 = m_dipole.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The integral of Y_{l, m}^* Y_{l', m'} is zero unless l=l' and m=m'. So in this case, the integral would be zero unless m1 = m_dipole and l=1 = l=1.

So, when we have the dipole operator component with m_dipole, the matrix element is non-zero only if m1 = m_dipole.

So, for each m1, the matrix element is non-zero only if the dipole operator used has m = m1.

Wait, but the dipole operator has three components: m=-1, 0, +1. So for each possible m_dipole (-1, 0, +1), the transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1, m1⟩ is allowed only if m1 = m_dipole.

So, for each m_dipole, the transition would produce m1 = m_dipole.

So, the first transition can go to m1 = -1, 0, +1, each via a different dipole component.

Each transition has a certain probability, which is proportional to the square of the matrix element for that component.

But what's the relative magnitude of each matrix element?

The matrix element for each dipole component (m_dipole) is given by the integral of Y_{1,m_dipole} Y_{0,0} Y_{1, m1}, which as discussed is non-zero only when m1 = m_dipole.

The magnitude of these integrals would determine the relative probabilities.

The integral for each m_dipole is:

(1/(sqrt(4π))) * ∫ Y_{1, m_dipole}^* Y_{1, m_dipole} dΩ.

Wait, no, wait: because Y_{0,0} is 1/sqrt(4π). So the integral becomes (1/sqrt(4π)) ∫ Y_{1, m_dipole}^* Y_{1, m_dipole} dΩ.

Which is (1/sqrt(4π)) * [sqrt( (4π/3)(2l+1) ) ] Wait, maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, considering that the integral of Y_{l m}^* Y_{l m} is 1, because it's normalized.

So, for each m_dipole, the integral is (1/(sqrt(4π))) * ∫ Y_{1, m_dipole}^* Y_{1, m_dipole} dΩ.

Which is (1/sqrt(4π)) * (sqrt( (4π/3)(2*1 +1) )) )? Wait, no, perhaps it's better to just use the known values of the integrals.

Wait, the integral ∫ Y_{1,m}^* Y_{1,m} dΩ is 1, because Y_{1,m} is normalized.

Wait, but the integral in question is (1/(sqrt(4π))) ∫ Y_{1, m_dipole}^* Y_{1, m_dipole} dΩ.

Which is (1/(sqrt(4π))) * 1 * (sqrt(4π)) )? No, because ∫ Y_{1,m}^* Y_{1,m} dΩ =1. So the integral becomes (1/sqrt(4π)) * 1.

Wait, no, Y_{1,m} is normalized, so ∫ Y_{1,m}^* Y_{1,m} dΩ =1.

So the integral in the matrix element is (1/sqrt(4π)) * 1.

Wait, but that would make all the matrix elements for the three m_dipole values equal. So each transition (m_dipole = -1, 0, +1) would have the same magnitude, leading to the same probability.

But that's not correct because the Y_{1,m} functions have different normalizations depending on m. Let me check.

Wait, the spherical harmonics Y_{l,m} are normalized such that ∫ |Y_{l,m}(θ,φ)|² dΩ = 1.

So, the integral for each m_dipole is (1/(sqrt(4π))) * ∫ Y_{1,m_dipole}^* Y_{1,m_dipole} dΩ.

But this is (1/(sqrt(4π))) * 1, which is same for all m_dipole. So the matrix elements for each m_dipole are the same in magnitude.

Wait, but that can’t be right because m_dipole affects the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, the matrix element for each m_dipole is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient ⟨1, m_dipole | 0, 0; 1, m_dipole ⟩.

Wait, perhaps the matrix element is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient ⟨1, m_dipole | 0, 0; 1, m_dipole ⟩.

But the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient ⟨ l1, m1; l2, m2 | l, m ⟩.

Wait, in this case, the initial state is |0, 0⟩, and the operator is |1, m_dipole⟩. So the product is |1, m_dipole⟩ |0,0⟩ → |1, m_dipole⟩.

So the expansion would involve |1, m_dipole⟩, so the CG coefficient is ⟨1, m_dipole | 1, m_dipole ⟩, which is 1.

Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining |1, m_dipole⟩ and |0,0⟩ to get |1, m_dipole⟩ is 1.

Wait, but the CG coefficient ⟨1, m | 1, m'; 0,0⟩ is zero unless m = m' + 0.

So, I'm getting a bit stuck here. But perhaps I can think in terms of the number of possible ways each m transition can happen.

Since the dipole operator has three components (m= -1, 0, +1), each corresponding to a different m1 in the intermediate state, and each with the same probability, the probabilities for each m1 would be the same.

So, each of the three possible m1 (0, +1, -1) would have an equal probability.

So, the first transition has equal probabilities for each m1, each with probability 1/3.

Then, for each m1, the second transition has a certain probability to reach m=0.

So, the second transition, from |2,1,m1⟩ to |1,0,0⟩, requires m1 →0, so m_dipole_second = -m1.

So, for each m1, the second transition's dipole component is m_dipole = -m1.

The probability for the second transition is proportional to the square of the matrix element, which again would be the same for each m_dipole, assuming equal probabilities.

Wait, but the dipole operator's matrix elements for the second transition may vary depending on m1.

Alternatively, perhaps each second transition has the same probability, so the overall probability for each two-step path is (1/3) * (probability of second step).

But what's the probability for the second step?

In the second step, the transition is from |2,1,m1⟩ to |1,0,0⟩.

The dipole operator's component used here is m_dipole = -m1.

The matrix element for this transition would be similar to the first step, but the initial state is |2,1,m1⟩.

The matrix element would be proportional to an integral of Y_{1, m_dipole}^* Y_{1, m1} Y_{0,0}.

Wait, same as before, the integral reduces to (1/(sqrt(4π))) ∫ Y_{1, m_dipole}^* Y_{1, m1} dΩ.

Which is zero unless m_dipole = m1.

Wait, but m_dipole is -m1. So unless m1 = -m_dipole, which implies m_dipole = -m1.

Wait, but in this case, the integral is (1/(sqrt(4π))) ∫ Y_{1, m_dipole}^* Y_{1, m1} dΩ.

Which is zero unless m_dipole = m1. But in our case, m_dipole = -m1, so unless m1 = 0, this integral is zero.

Wait, that can't be right. Because for the second step, m1 can be 0, +1, or -1.

Wait, if m1 is 0, then m_dipole is 0, so the integral is non-zero.

If m1 is +1, m_dipole is -1 → the integral is ∫ Y_{1,-1}^* Y_{1, +1} dΩ.

Which is zero because the integral of Y_{l m}^* Y_{l' m'} is zero unless l=l' and m = m'.

So, for m1=+1, the integral is zero. Similarly, for m1=-1, the integral is zero. Only when m1=0, the integral is non-zero.

Wait, that's a crucial point! So, the second step can only proceed if the intermediate state has m=0.

Because when m1 is +1, the dipole operator's component required to change m by -1 is m_dipole = -1, but the integral is zero because Y_{1,-1} and Y_{1,1} are orthogonal.

Similarly, for m1=-1, the required dipole component is m_dipole=+1, but the integral is zero.

Only when m1=0, the required dipole component is m_dipole=0, and the integral is non-zero.

So this means that only the path that goes through |2,1,0⟩ in the first step can proceed to the final state |1,0,0⟩ in the second step. The other two paths (m1=+1 or -1) have zero probability for the second step.

Wait, that changes everything. So the only possible two-step path is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩.

So the probability of this path would be the product of the first step's probability and the second step's probability.

But wait, the first step has a probability of 1/3 for each m1. But for the second step, only the m1=0 case contributes.

So the overall probability is (1/3) * (probability of second step for m1=0).

But what's the probability of the second step for m1=0?

Well, in the second step, the dipole component is m_dipole=0. The matrix element is ∫ Y_{0,0} Y_{1,0}^* Y_{1,0} dΩ.

Wait, no, the matrix element is ∫ Y_{1,0}^* (dipole component m=0) Y_{1,0} Y_{0,0} dΩ.

Which is (1/(sqrt(4π))) ∫ Y_{1,0}^* Y_{1,0} dΩ.

Because the dipole component for m_dipole=0 is Y_{1,0}.

So this integral is (1/(sqrt(4π))) * (sqrt(4π)/ (2l+1) )) ? Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, the integral becomes (1/(sqrt(4π))) * ∫ Y_{1,0} Y_{1,0} Y_{0,0} dΩ.

But Y_{0,0} is 1/sqrt(4π), so:

(1/(sqrt(4π))) * (1/sqrt(4π)) ) ∫ Y_{1,0}^2 dΩ.

Which simplifies to (1/(4π)) * ∫ Y_{1,0}^2 dΩ.

But Y_{1,0} is sqrt(3/(4π)) ), because |Y_{1,0}|^2 = 3/(4π) over the sphere.

So the integral becomes (1/(4π)) * (3/(4π)) ) * 4π = (1/(4π)) *3 = 3/(4π).

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting mixed up. Let me compute it properly.

The integral of Y_{1,0}^2 dΩ is ∫ |Y_{1,0}|² dΩ = 1, since Y_{1,0} is normalized.

So, the integral becomes (1/(sqrt(4π))) * (1/sqrt(4π)) ) * 1 = 1/(4π).

Wait, but that can't be right because the dipole matrix element's square is the probability, and it should be non-zero.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the magnitude squared of the matrix element.

So, the matrix element is proportional to (1/(sqrt(4π))) * ∫ Y_{1,0}^* Y_{1,0} Y_{0,0} dΩ.

Which is (1/(sqrt(4π))) * (1/(sqrt(4π))) ) ∫ Y_{1,0}^2 dΩ.

But ∫ Y_{1,0}^2 dΩ =1. So the matrix element is (1/(4π)) *1.

So the square of the matrix element is (1/(4π))².

But I'm not sure about this approach. Alternatively, perhaps the probability for the second step is the same as the first step when m1=0.

Wait, but earlier I thought that for the second step, only m1=0 contributes. So the total probability is the probability of the first step leading to m1=0 multiplied by the probability of the second step leading from m1=0 to m=0.

Assuming that the first step has probability 1/3 for each m1, and the second step has the same probability as the first step, then the total probability would be (1/3) * (probability of second step for m1=0).

But I'm not exactly clear on the exact probabilities here.

Wait, but based on the above reasoning, only the path through |2,1,0⟩ is possible. So the other options (B, C, D) are incorrect because they involve m1=+1 or -1, which can't proceed to the final state.

So the only possible correct option is option A, which is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/3.

Wait, but the options also have option D, which is the same first transition as option A, but with probability 2/3.

Wait, why would the probability be 2/3 for option D?

Ah, perhaps because in reality, the radial parts of the wavefunctions for the dipole transitions also play a role. The matrix elements include the radial integrals, which might have different probabilities for different steps.

But in the non-relativistic hydrogen atom, the dipole transition probabilities are often proportional to the square of the matrix elements, which are products of angular and radial parts.

But without knowing the exact radial integrals, perhaps the probability is determined by the number of possible paths.

Wait, but earlier we determined that only the m1=0 path contributes, so the overall probability would be the product of the first step's probability (1/3) and the second step's probability (which, assuming it's the same as the first step, would be 1/3 again).

So the total probability would be (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9.

But that doesn't match any of the options. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the radial integrals are the same for both steps, so the probability is (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9, but that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the probability for each step isn't 1/3. Maybe the first step has a different probability for each m1.

Wait, another approach: the possible dipole transitions from |3,0,0⟩ are to |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩. Each of these transitions has a certain probability.

If each m1 has a probability of 1/3, then the first step's probabilities are each 1/3. Then, the second step from |2,1, m1⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ would have probabilities as discussed earlier: only m1=0 is allowed, and the second step's probability is 1/3 again.

So the total probability for the path via m1=0 is (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9.

But according to the options, option A says the probability is 1/3.

Hmm, maybe the second step's probability is 1, so the total is 1/3.

But that would imply that once you're in |2,1,0⟩, the transition to |1,0,0⟩ is certain, but that might not be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the second step's matrix element is larger for m1=0, making the probability higher.

Wait, perhaps the radial part of the matrix element for the first step (n=3 to n=2) is the same as for the second step (n=2 to n=1), but perhaps the angular part is different.

But without knowing the exact expressions, this is getting too vague.

Another thought: Perhaps the probability for each dipole transition is proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, which for the dipole transitions from l=0 to l=1 is the same for each m.

So each transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m1⟩ has the same probability, 1/3.

Then, the second transition from |2,1, m1⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ would have a probability of 1/3 only when m1=0. For m1=+1 or -1, it's zero.

So the overall probability is (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9 for the path via m1=0.

But that's not one of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the first step's probability is 1/3, and the second step's probability is 1, leading to a total of 1/3.

But why would the second step have a probability of 1?

Alternatively, perhaps the only allowed path is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, and the probability is the square of the matrix element for the overall two-step process.

But without the exact calculation, it's tricky.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: probability 1/3.

Option D: probability 2/3.

Assuming that only the m1=0 path is allowed, and the total probability is 1/3, then option A would be correct.

But wait, I'm getting confused. Another approach: consider that each transition (step) has a certain probability, and the overall process is two steps.

But if only the m1=0 path is allowed, then the probability is the product of the two steps.

If each step has a probability of 1/3, then the total is 1/9, but that's not an option.

But option A says the probability is 1/3. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step's probability is 1/3, and the second step's probability is 1, so the total is 1/3.

But why would the second step have probability 1? Because the transition from |2,1,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ is certain.

Alternatively, perhaps because the selection rules only allow that path, and all the probability goes into that single path.

Wait, but then the probability would be the product of the individual step probabilities. So if the first step is 1/3, and the second step is 1, the total is 1/3.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition from |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ has a certain probability, and from |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ has another probability.

But without knowing the exact values, I'm not sure.

But given the options, and the reasoning that only m1=0 contributes, the only possible correct option is A, which is the path through |2,1,0⟩ with probability 1/3.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state in the hydrogen atom to the |1,0,0⟩ state via two dipole transitions. The analysis is based on the selection rules for electric dipole transitions, which require Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. The process involves two steps: 

1. **First Transition**: From |3,0,0⟩ to an intermediate state |2,1,m₁⟩, where m₁ can be 0, +1, or -1. Each of these transitions is allowed, and the probabilities for the three possible m₁ values are assumed to be equal, giving each a probability of 1/3.

2. **Second Transition**: From the intermediate state |2,1,m₁⟩ to the final state |1,0,0⟩. For this step, the selection rules require that m₁ must change to 0. This means the second transition is only allowed if m₁ = 0. If m₁ = +1 or m₁ = -1, the transition is forbidden because the required dipole components for these cases result in zero overlap.

Thus, the only valid path is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩. The probability of this path is the product of the probabilities of the two steps. Assuming the first step has a probability of 1/3 and the second step is certain (probability = 1), the total probability for this path is 1/3. 

The other options are incorrect because they involve intermediate states with m₁ = +1 or m₁ = -1, which cannot proceed to the final state |1,0,0⟩ due to the selection rules.

**Critical Analysis of Options**:
- **Option A**: Correct. The path |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ is valid, and the probability is given as 1/3.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The path |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ is forbidden because the second transition cannot change m from +1 to 0.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The path |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ is forbidden because the second transition cannot change m from -1 to 0.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. While the path |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ is valid, the probability of 2/3 is inconsistent with the selection rules and the assumed equal probabilities for the first step.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**.

Answer: A

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here about the hydrogen atom. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. I remember that in such transitions, certain selection rules apply.

Hmm, the selection rules for electric dipole transitions in hydrogen... I think the main ones are Δl = ±1 for the orbital angular momentum, and Δm can be 0, ±1. Also, the transition is allowed only if the final state has these changes. So, the initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0.

First transition: from n=3 to a lower n, but l must increase by 1. So l was 0, so after the first transition, l becomes 1. So the first step is to go from |3,0,0⟩ to something with l=1. Like n=2, l=1. Because n has to decrease by 1 in this case, but wait, no, n can change by any number as long as the other selection rules are met, right? Wait, no, the selection rule for n is different. Oh wait, no, I think the electric dipole selection rule for n is Δn = ±1, but wait no, that's not right. Wait, no, I'm confusing with the selection rules in other contexts. Oh no, wait, the standard electric dipole selection rules in hydrogen are: Δl = ±1 (excluding l=0 to l=0), and for m, Δm = 0, ±1.

Wait, wait, no. I think for each transition, the selection rules are applied. So each dipole transition must follow Δl = ±1, but in this question, the state decays via two dipole transitions. So from 3,0,0 to some intermediate state, then to 1,0,0.

Let me think. The initial state is n=3, l=0. The final state is n=1, l=0. So we have to have two transitions. Each transition must follow the selection rules.

First transition: from n=3, l=0 to some state with higher or lower l. Since from l=0, the next possible is l=1. So the first transition must go to l=1. So the intermediate state must have l=1. What possible n can it have? Well, for the first transition, any n allowed as long as l changes by ±1. But since the initial state is n=3, l=0, the first step could be to n=2, l=1 because Δn can be anything as long as Δl=±1. Hmm, wait, no, wait. Wait, the selection rule isn't directly on Δn; Δn can be any as long as you have a dipole transition, but in practice, the energy levels are such that transitions happen between adjacent n levels. Wait, no, that's more about which transitions are more probable. For dipole transitions, l must change by ±1, but n can change by any amount as long as l is changing. But in reality, for hydrogen, transitions usually happen between adjacent shells because the energy difference is suitable. But the problem doesn't specify that; it just says via two dipole transitions.

So first transition: from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩, where m can be 0, ±1. Because Δm can be 0, ±1.

Then the second transition goes from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩.

Wait, but wait, the final state is |1,0,0⟩. So for the second transition, the initial state is |2,1,m⟩, and the final is |1,0,0⟩.

So let's apply the selection rules for the second transition.

In the second transition, l is going from 1 to 0. So Δl = -1, which is allowed. So that's fine.

Now, the m values: in the intermediate state, m is something, and in the final state m is 0.

So Δm can be 0, ±1. But the initial state's m is m', and the final is 0. So m' can be -1, 0, or +1.

Wait, let's think about how the transitions happen. Each transition can change m by 0, +1, or -1.

So for the first transition: m starts at 0. So the possible m values after first transition are m=0, +1, or -1. So the intermediate state could be |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, or |2,1,-1⟩.

Then, in the second transition from the intermediate state to |1,0,0⟩, the m must go from m' to 0. So for each possible m', what are the possible changes?

Case 1: Intermediate state is |2,1,0⟩. Then m needs to change by 0. So the second transition can do that.

Case 2: Intermediate state is |2,1,1⟩. Then m must change by -1 to get to 0.

Case 3: Intermediate state is |2,1,-1⟩. Then m must change by +1 to get to 0.

So all three possibilities are allowed. But now, the question is about the probabilities.

Wait, but the question says the transition route and the corresponding probability. The options are giving specific routes and probabilities.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Goes through |2,1,0⟩ and has probability 1/3.

Option B: Goes through |2,1,1⟩, probability 1/4.

Option C: Goes through |2,1,-1⟩, probability 1/4.

Option D: Goes through |2,1,0⟩, and probability 2/3. Wait, but option D doesn't have a state after the first step. Wait, looking at the options, option D says something like |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 2/3. So that's a possible route.

But I need to think about the possible probabilities for each possible path. The probability for each transition depends on the matrix elements of the dipole operator between the states. The total probability would be the sum of the probabilities of each possible path.

Wait, but the question says the transition decays via two dipole transitions. So the entire process is two steps, each dipole.

Each transition has a certain probability, and the overall probability is the product of the two probabilities for each step. So for each possible intermediate state, we'd calculate the product of the first transition's probability and the second transition's probability, then sum over all possible intermediates.

But I'm not exactly sure about the specific probabilities. Alternatively, perhaps the selection rules and the possible m values determine which options are possible. Let's think about allowed transitions.

Each step must have Δm = 0, ±1. So the first transition from m=0 to m=0, +1, or -1.

Then, the second transition must take m from whatever it was to 0. So the second transition's Δm can be 0, ±1.

So, if the first transition ends at m=0, the second transition can stay at m=0, but wait, no, because the final state's m is 0, so the second transition must go from m_i to 0.

Wait, in the second transition, the initial m is m_i, and the final is 0. So Δm = 0 - m_i. So for each possible m_i, what is allowed?

If m_i is 0, then Δm =0, which is allowed. If m_i is +1, then Δm = -1, which is allowed. If m_i is -1, then Δm = +1, which is allowed. So all three are possible.

So all three intermediate states (m=0, +1, -1) are possible. So the total probability would be the sum of the probabilities of each possible two-step path.

But the options list specific paths and their probabilities. So each option's transition path is a specific two-step sequence, and each has its own probability.

But wait, the options state the overall probability for each route. So for each option, what is the probability of that specific route?

But the question is, which option is correct?

Let me think about the possible paths.

Option A: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/3.

Option B: → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/4.

Option C: → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, probability 1/4.

Option D: → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, with probability 2/3.

Wait, but the sum of probabilities for all possible paths must be 1 (if all paths are considered), but the options don't present that. Alternatively, perhaps the question is only considering a specific two-step path, and the probability given is for that path.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the possible allowed transitions and the number of possible paths.

But perhaps I should think about the possible allowed m transitions in each step.

Wait, another approach: The initial state is |3,0,0⟩. The final state is |1,0,0⟩. The transition requires two steps, each a dipole transition.

Each dipole transition can cause a change in m of 0, +1, or -1.

So, the first transition can take m from 0 to 0, +1, or -1.

The second transition must take m from whatever it was after the first step to 0.

So, from the first step, possible m values after step 1 are 0, +1, -1.

For each, the second step must change m to 0.

So, for each possible intermediate m:

If m after step 1 is 0, then step 2 can have Δm=0 (so m remains 0).

If m is +1, step 2 must have Δm=-1.

If m is -1, step 2 must have Δm=+1.

Each of these is allowed.

Now, the overall number of possible paths is the sum of the probabilities for each possible m path.

But perhaps the probabilities are determined by the square of the dipole matrix elements, but that's complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of allowed m transitions determines the relative probabilities.

Wait, each dipole transition can change m by 0, +1, or -1. So for each step, there are three possibilities for m.

But the first step starts at m=0, so possible m's after first step are 0, +1, -1.

The second step goes to m=0. So for each of the three possible m's after the first step, there's one allowed transition in the second step.

So, the total number of possible two-step paths is 3 (from first step) × 1 (each leads to one way in second step) = 3 paths.

But the question is about the possible transition routes and their probabilities. The possible routes are the three possible intermediates, each leading to the final state.

But the options A, B, C, D don't present all three routes; each option is a single route. So perhaps the probabilities in the options are the probabilities for each individual route.

But how do we calculate the probabilities for each route?

Wait, the probability for a transition is proportional to the square of the matrix element. But in hydrogen, transitions are also forbidden if the integral of the dipole operator between the initial and final states is zero.

But perhaps the probability is determined by the number of allowed m transitions.

Wait, but I'm not exactly remembering the exact probabilities. Alternatively, perhaps the probabilities are determined by the number of possible ways the m can change.

But perhaps let's think in terms of angular momentum. The dipole operator has components along x, y, z. The transition probabilities are given by the squares of the matrix elements for each component.

Wait, the dipole operator is proportional to r times the spherical harmonics Y_{1,m}, where m can be -1, 0, +1.

So the transition from |n, l, m⟩ to |n', l', m'⟩ is allowed only if m' = m + m_dipole, where m_dipole is -1, 0, +1.

So for the first transition, |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1, m1⟩. So m1 can be 0, +1, -1.

The probability for each m1 is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element for that transition.

Similarly, the second transition is |2,1, m1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩. So m1 must be such that 0 = m1 + m_dipole_second. So m_dipole_second = -m1.

Wait, no: the dipole operator in the second transition would cause a change in m by its own m, so m_final = m_initial + m_dipole.

Wait, in the first step: initial m is 0. So m1 can be 0 + m_dipole (where m_dipole is -1, 0, +1).

In the second step: initial m is m1, final m is 0. So 0 = m1 + m_dipole_second → m_dipole_second = -m1.

So, for the first step, each m1 has a probability proportional to |⟨2,1,m1| e r |3,0,0⟩|².

Similarly, for the second step, each transition has a probability proportional to |⟨1,0,0| e r |2,1,m1⟩|².

But I don't remember the exact expressions for these matrix elements. However, I think that the matrix elements are non-zero only when the angular momentum conditions are met, which we've already considered.

But perhaps the key point is that the probability for each path is the product of the probabilities of each step.

But let's think about the possible m1 values and their corresponding probabilities.

Wait, for the first transition from |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m1⟩, the possible m1 are 0, +1, -1. Each of these would have a certain probability.

The probability for each m1 is determined by the square of the matrix element.

In hydrogen, the dipole transitions' matrix elements depend on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which involve the Wigner 3-j symbols or spherical harmonics integrals.

Alternatively, perhaps the probabilities are the same for each allowed m, but I'm not sure. Another approach: the possible transitions for each step.

In the first step: when going from l=0 (s orbital) to l=1 (p orbital), the possible m1 are 0, +1, -1.

The dipole operator has components in each of these m directions. So each would have a certain weight.

Wait, from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,0⟩: the transition is caused by the dipole operator's m=0 component. Similarly, for the m=+1 and m=-1 transitions.

The probabilities for each transition could be different. But without knowing the exact matrix elements, perhaps we can think in terms of symmetry.

Wait, for the first transition, the matrix element for m=0 is perhaps the same as for m=+1 and m=-1. Or perhaps it's larger. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition probabilities for each m are proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which for the initial state being l=0, m=0.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for coupling l=0 and l'=1 would be non-zero only for certain m transitions.

Wait, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient ⟨ l', m' | l, m ⟩ is non-zero only when m' = m + m_dipole.

Wait, perhaps the probability for each m1 is proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for that m.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding angular momenta. Wait, but in this case, the initial state is |3,0,0⟩, and the transition is to |2,1,m1⟩.

Wait, actually, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are for combining two angular momenta. Hmm, maybe it's more complicated than that. Alternatively, perhaps the matrix elements for the dipole transitions depend on the overlap of the initial and final angular momentum states.

Alternatively, perhaps the selection rules for the dipole transitions are such that the transitions are possible only for certain m changes, but all that is considered.

Wait, perhaps the probability for each m1 is the same. So in the first transition, each of the three possible m1 states (0, +1, -1) has an equal probability. Then, the second transition would have some probabilities depending on m1.

Wait, but for the second transition, which goes from |2,1,m1⟩ to |1,0,0⟩, the matrix elements would depend on m1.

Hmm, perhaps the probabilities for the second step are not the same for all m1.

Alternatively, another approach: in the non-relativistic hydrogen atom, the transition probabilities can be calculated using Fermi's Golden Rule or using the matrix elements.

The transition probability is proportional to the square of the matrix element ⟨ final | r | initial ⟩.

The dipole operator is proportional to r. So, the transition from |n_i, l_i, m_i⟩ to |n_f, l_f, m_f⟩ is allowed only if l_i and l_f differ by 1, and |m_i - m_f| ≤1.

But the probability amplitude for each transition is given by the integral:

⟨n_f l_f m_f | r |n_i l_i m_i⟩.

In hydrogen, this can be expressed in terms of the spherical harmonics and radial wavefunctions.

But for the purposes of this question, perhaps the key point is that the transition probabilities depend on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients and the overlap of the radial wavefunctions.

In the first step, from n=3, l=0 to n=2, l=1, the radial integral is proportional to the square of the wavefunction overlap times the angular integral.

Wait, but the angular integral for the transition from l=0 to l=1 is non-zero only for certain m transitions. So, perhaps each m1 (0, +1, -1) has a certain angular integral value.

The angular integral is ∫ Y_{1, m1}^* Y_{0,0} Y_{1,0} dΩ. Wait, no, perhaps it's ∫ Y_{1, m1}^* r · Y_{0,0} Y_{1,0} dΩ? Not quite sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the expansion of the dipole operator in terms of spherical harmonics.

The dipole moment operator is given by:

r = r (Y_{1, -1}, Y_{1,0}, Y_{1,1} ), so it has three components along x, y, z.

Each component corresponds to a different m change.

So, the transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m1⟩ is governed by the component of the dipole operator with m = m1.

So, the matrix element for each m1 is proportional to the integral of Y_{1, m1}^* Y_{0,0} Y_{1,0} multiplied by the radial part.

Wait, no, more precisely, the dipole operator's angular part is proportional to Y_{1, m_dipole}, so the matrix element is:

⟨2,1,m1 | Y_{1, m_dipole} |3,0,0⟩.

Which is the integral of Y_{1, m1}^* Y_{1, m_dipole} Y_{0,0}.

Because the initial state is l=0 (Y_{0,0}), and the operator has l=1, so the product Y_{1, m_dipole} Y_{0,0} would be expressed in terms of spherical harmonics of higher l.

But since the initial state is l=0, the integral over angles would be zero unless the product Y_{1, m_dipole} Y_{0,0} has an l=1 component.

Wait, the integral becomes:

∫ Y_{1, m1}^* Y_{1, m_dipole} Y_{0,0} dΩ.

But Y_{0,0} is a constant (1/(sqrt(4π))), so:

(1/(sqrt(4π))) ∫ Y_{1, m1}^* Y_{1, m_dipole} dΩ.

This is the integral of the product of three spherical harmonics. The integral is non-zero only if certain conditions are met. Specifically, the integral ∫ Y_{l1 m1} Y_{l2 m2} Y_{l3 m3} dΩ is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient ⟨ l1, m1; l2, m2 | l3, m3 ⟩ multiplied by some factors.

In this case, l1=1, m1= m1.

l2=1, m2= m_dipole.

l3=0, m3=0.

Wait, no: the initial state is l=0, so the product Y_{1, m_dipole} Y_{0,0} must produce a component of l=1. Because the operator is l=1.

But wait, the product of Y_{1, m_dipole} and Y_{0,0} can be expressed as a sum over l=1 (since 1 +0 ≥1 and ≤1+0=1). So the product is proportional to Y_{1, m_dipole}.

Wait, perhaps the integral simplifies because Y_{0,0} is 1/(sqrt(4π)), so the integral becomes (1/(sqrt(4π))) ∫ Y_{1, m1}^* Y_{1, m_dipole} dΩ.

Which is (1/(sqrt(4π))) times the integral of Y_{1, m1}^* Y_{1, m_dipole} over all angles.

But the integral of Y_{a}^* Y_{b} is zero unless a = b. So this integral is zero unless m1 = m_dipole.

Because the integral of Y_{1, m1}^* Y_{1, m_dipole} is zero unless m1 = m_dipole.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The integral of Y_{l, m}^* Y_{l', m'} is zero unless l=l' and m=m'. So in this case, the integral would be zero unless m1 = m_dipole and l=1 = l=1.

So, when we have the dipole operator component with m_dipole, the matrix element is non-zero only if m1 = m_dipole.

So, for each m1, the matrix element is non-zero only if the dipole operator used has m = m1.

Wait, but the dipole operator has three components: m=-1, 0, +1. So for each possible m_dipole (-1, 0, +1), the transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1, m1⟩ is allowed only if m1 = m_dipole.

So, for each m_dipole, the transition would produce m1 = m_dipole.

So, the first transition can go to m1 = -1, 0, +1, each via a different dipole component.

Each transition has a certain probability, which is proportional to the square of the matrix element for that component.

But what's the relative magnitude of each matrix element?

The matrix element for each dipole component (m_dipole) is given by the integral of Y_{1,m_dipole} Y_{0,0} Y_{1, m1}, which as discussed is non-zero only when m1 = m_dipole.

The magnitude of these integrals would determine the relative probabilities.

The integral for each m_dipole is:

(1/(sqrt(4π))) * ∫ Y_{1, m_dipole}^* Y_{1, m_dipole} dΩ.

Wait, no, wait: because Y_{0,0} is 1/sqrt(4π). So the integral becomes (1/sqrt(4π)) ∫ Y_{1, m_dipole}^* Y_{1, m_dipole} dΩ.

Which is (1/sqrt(4π)) * [sqrt( (4π/3)(2l+1) ) ] Wait, maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, considering that the integral of Y_{l m}^* Y_{l m} is 1, because it's normalized.

So, for each m_dipole, the integral is (1/(sqrt(4π))) * ∫ Y_{1, m_dipole}^* Y_{1, m_dipole} dΩ.

Which is (1/sqrt(4π)) * (sqrt( (4π/3)(2*1 +1) )) )? Wait, no, perhaps it's better to just use the known values of the integrals.

Wait, the integral ∫ Y_{1,m}^* Y_{1,m} dΩ is 1, because Y_{1,m} is normalized.

Wait, but the integral in question is (1/(sqrt(4π))) ∫ Y_{1, m_dipole}^* Y_{1, m_dipole} dΩ.

Which is (1/(sqrt(4π))) * 1 * (sqrt(4π)) )? No, because ∫ Y_{1,m}^* Y_{1,m} dΩ =1. So the integral becomes (1/sqrt(4π)) * 1.

Wait, no, Y_{1,m} is normalized, so ∫ Y_{1,m}^* Y_{1,m} dΩ =1.

So the integral in the matrix element is (1/sqrt(4π)) * 1.

Wait, but that would make all the matrix elements for the three m_dipole values equal. So each transition (m_dipole = -1, 0, +1) would have the same magnitude, leading to the same probability.

But that's not correct because the Y_{1,m} functions have different normalizations depending on m. Let me check.

Wait, the spherical harmonics Y_{l,m} are normalized such that ∫ |Y_{l,m}(θ,φ)|² dΩ = 1.

So, the integral for each m_dipole is (1/(sqrt(4π))) * ∫ Y_{1,m_dipole}^* Y_{1,m_dipole} dΩ.

But this is (1/(sqrt(4π))) * 1, which is same for all m_dipole. So the matrix elements for each m_dipole are the same in magnitude.

Wait, but that can’t be right because m_dipole affects the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, the matrix element for each m_dipole is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient ⟨1, m_dipole | 0, 0; 1, m_dipole ⟩.

Wait, perhaps the matrix element is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient ⟨1, m_dipole | 0, 0; 1, m_dipole ⟩.

But the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient ⟨ l1, m1; l2, m2 | l, m ⟩.

Wait, in this case, the initial state is |0, 0⟩, and the operator is |1, m_dipole⟩. So the product is |1, m_dipole⟩ |0,0⟩ → |1, m_dipole⟩.

So the expansion would involve |1, m_dipole⟩, so the CG coefficient is ⟨1, m_dipole | 1, m_dipole ⟩, which is 1.

Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining |1, m_dipole⟩ and |0,0⟩ to get |1, m_dipole⟩ is 1.

Wait, but the CG coefficient ⟨1, m | 1, m'; 0,0⟩ is zero unless m = m' + 0.

So, I'm getting a bit stuck here. But perhaps I can think in terms of the number of possible ways each m transition can happen.

Since the dipole operator has three components (m= -1, 0, +1), each corresponding to a different m1 in the intermediate state, and each with the same probability, the probabilities for each m1 would be the same.

So, each of the three possible m1 (0, +1, -1) would have an equal probability.

So, the first transition has equal probabilities for each m1, each with probability 1/3.

Then, for each m1, the second transition has a certain probability to reach m=0.

So, the second transition, from |2,1,m1⟩ to |1,0,0⟩, requires m1 →0, so m_dipole_second = -m1.

So, for each m1, the second transition's dipole component is m_dipole = -m1.

The probability for the second transition is proportional to the square of the matrix element, which again would be the same for each m_dipole, assuming equal probabilities.

Wait, but the dipole operator's matrix elements for the second transition may vary depending on m1.

Alternatively, perhaps each second transition has the same probability, so the overall probability for each two-step path is (1/3) * (probability of second step).

But what's the probability for the second step?

In the second step, the transition is from |2,1,m1⟩ to |1,0,0⟩.

The dipole operator's component used here is m_dipole = -m1.

The matrix element for this transition would be similar to the first step, but the initial state is |2,1,m1⟩.

The matrix element would be proportional to an integral of Y_{1, m_dipole}^* Y_{1, m1} Y_{0,0}.

Wait, same as before, the integral reduces to (1/(sqrt(4π))) ∫ Y_{1, m_dipole}^* Y_{1, m1} dΩ.

Which is zero unless m_dipole = m1.

Wait, but m_dipole is -m1. So unless m1 = -m_dipole, which implies m_dipole = -m1.

Wait, but in this case, the integral is (1/(sqrt(4π))) ∫ Y_{1, m_dipole}^* Y_{1, m1} dΩ.

Which is zero unless m_dipole = m1. But in our case, m_dipole = -m1, so unless m1 = 0, this integral is zero.

Wait, that can't be right. Because for the second step, m1 can be 0, +1, or -1.

Wait, if m1 is 0, then m_dipole is 0, so the integral is non-zero.

If m1 is +1, m_dipole is -1 → the integral is ∫ Y_{1,-1}^* Y_{1, +1} dΩ.

Which is zero because the integral of Y_{l m}^* Y_{l' m'} is zero unless l=l' and m = m'.

So, for m1=+1, the integral is zero. Similarly, for m1=-1, the integral is zero. Only when m1=0, the integral is non-zero.

Wait, that's a crucial point! So, the second step can only proceed if the intermediate state has m=0.

Because when m1 is +1, the dipole operator's component required to change m by -1 is m_dipole = -1, but the integral is zero because Y_{1,-1} and Y_{1,1} are orthogonal.

Similarly, for m1=-1, the required dipole component is m_dipole=+1, but the integral is zero.

Only when m1=0, the required dipole component is m_dipole=0, and the integral is non-zero.

So this means that only the path that goes through |2,1,0⟩ in the first step can proceed to the final state |1,0,0⟩ in the second step. The other two paths (m1=+1 or -1) have zero probability for the second step.

Wait, that changes everything. So the only possible two-step path is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩.

So the probability of this path would be the product of the first step's probability and the second step's probability.

But wait, the first step has a probability of 1/3 for each m1. But for the second step, only the m1=0 case contributes.

So the overall probability is (1/3) * (probability of second step for m1=0).

But what's the probability of the second step for m1=0?

Well, in the second step, the dipole component is m_dipole=0. The matrix element is ∫ Y_{0,0} Y_{1,0}^* Y_{1,0} dΩ.

Wait, no, the matrix element is ∫ Y_{1,0}^* (dipole component m=0) Y_{1,0} Y_{0,0} dΩ.

Which is (1/(sqrt(4π))) ∫ Y_{1,0}^* Y_{1,0} dΩ.

Because the dipole component for m_dipole=0 is Y_{1,0}.

So this integral is (1/(sqrt(4π))) * (sqrt(4π)/ (2l+1) )) ? Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, the integral becomes (1/(sqrt(4π))) * ∫ Y_{1,0} Y_{1,0} Y_{0,0} dΩ.

But Y_{0,0} is 1/sqrt(4π), so:

(1/(sqrt(4π))) * (1/sqrt(4π)) ) ∫ Y_{1,0}^2 dΩ.

Which simplifies to (1/(4π)) * ∫ Y_{1,0}^2 dΩ.

But Y_{1,0} is sqrt(3/(4π)) ), because |Y_{1,0}|^2 = 3/(4π) over the sphere.

So the integral becomes (1/(4π)) * (3/(4π)) ) * 4π = (1/(4π)) *3 = 3/(4π).

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting mixed up. Let me compute it properly.

The integral of Y_{1,0}^2 dΩ is ∫ |Y_{1,0}|² dΩ = 1, since Y_{1,0} is normalized.

So, the integral becomes (1/(sqrt(4π))) * (1/sqrt(4π)) ) * 1 = 1/(4π).

Wait, but that can't be right because the dipole matrix element's square is the probability, and it should be non-zero.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the magnitude squared of the matrix element.

So, the matrix element is proportional to (1/(sqrt(4π))) * ∫ Y_{1,0}^* Y_{1,0} Y_{0,0} dΩ.

Which is (1/(sqrt(4π))) * (1/(sqrt(4π))) ) ∫ Y_{1,0}^2 dΩ.

But ∫ Y_{1,0}^2 dΩ =1. So the matrix element is (1/(4π)) *1.

So the square of the matrix element is (1/(4π))².

But I'm not sure about this approach. Alternatively, perhaps the probability for the second step is the same as the first step when m1=0.

Wait, but earlier I thought that for the second step, only m1=0 contributes. So the total probability is the probability of the first step leading to m1=0 multiplied by the probability of the second step leading from m1=0 to m=0.

Assuming that the first step has probability 1/3 for each m1, and the second step has the same probability as the first step, then the total probability would be (1/3) * (probability of second step for m1=0).

But I'm not exactly clear on the exact probabilities here.

Wait, but based on the above reasoning, only the path through |2,1,0⟩ is possible. So the other options (B, C, D) are incorrect because they involve m1=+1 or -1, which can't proceed to the final state.

So the only possible correct option is option A, which is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/3.

Wait, but the options also have option D, which is the same first transition as option A, but with probability 2/3.

Wait, why would the probability be 2/3 for option D?

Ah, perhaps because in reality, the radial parts of the wavefunctions for the dipole transitions also play a role. The matrix elements include the radial integrals, which might have different probabilities for different steps.

But in the non-relativistic hydrogen atom, the dipole transition probabilities are often proportional to the square of the matrix elements, which are products of angular and radial parts.

But without knowing the exact radial integrals, perhaps the probability is determined by the number of possible paths.

Wait, but earlier we determined that only the m1=0 path contributes, so the overall probability would be the product of the first step's probability (1/3) and the second step's probability (which, assuming it's the same as the first step, would be 1/3 again).

So the total probability would be (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9.

But that doesn't match any of the options. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the radial integrals are the same for both steps, so the probability is (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9, but that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the probability for each step isn't 1/3. Maybe the first step has a different probability for each m1.

Wait, another approach: the possible dipole transitions from |3,0,0⟩ are to |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩. Each of these transitions has a certain probability.

If each m1 has a probability of 1/3, then the first step's probabilities are each 1/3. Then, the second step from |2,1, m1⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ would have probabilities as discussed earlier: only m1=0 is allowed, and the second step's probability is 1/3 again.

So the total probability for the path via m1=0 is (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9.

But according to the options, option A says the probability is 1/3.

Hmm, maybe the second step's probability is 1, so the total is 1/3.

But that would imply that once you're in |2,1,0⟩, the transition to |1,0,0⟩ is certain, but that might not be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the second step's matrix element is larger for m1=0, making the probability higher.

Wait, perhaps the radial part of the matrix element for the first step (n=3 to n=2) is the same as for the second step (n=2 to n=1), but perhaps the angular part is different.

But without knowing the exact expressions, this is getting too vague.

Another thought: Perhaps the probability for each dipole transition is proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, which for the dipole transitions from l=0 to l=1 is the same for each m.

So each transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m1⟩ has the same probability, 1/3.

Then, the second transition from |2,1, m1⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ would have a probability of 1/3 only when m1=0. For m1=+1 or -1, it's zero.

So the overall probability is (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9 for the path via m1=0.

But that's not one of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the first step's probability is 1/3, and the second step's probability is 1, leading to a total of 1/3.

But why would the second step have a probability of 1?

Alternatively, perhaps the only allowed path is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, and the probability is the square of the matrix element for the overall two-step process.

But without the exact calculation, it's tricky.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: probability 1/3.

Option D: probability 2/3.

Assuming that only the m1=0 path is allowed, and the total probability is 1/3, then option A would be correct.

But wait, I'm getting confused. Another approach: consider that each transition (step) has a certain probability, and the overall process is two steps.

But if only the m1=0 path is allowed, then the probability is the product of the two steps.

If each step has a probability of 1/3, then the total is 1/9, but that's not an option.

But option A says the probability is 1/3. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step's probability is 1/3, and the second step's probability is 1, so the total is 1/3.

But why would the second step have probability 1? Because the transition from |2,1,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ is certain.

Alternatively, perhaps because the selection rules only allow that path, and all the probability goes into that single path.

Wait, but then the probability would be the product of the individual step probabilities. So if the first step is 1/3, and the second step is 1, the total is 1/3.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition from |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ has a certain probability, and from |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ has another probability.

But without knowing the exact values, I'm not sure.

But given the options, and the reasoning that only m1=0 contributes, the only possible correct option is A, which is the path through |2,1,0⟩ with probability 1/3.


The question involves the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state in the hydrogen atom to the |1,0,0⟩ state via two dipole transitions. The analysis is based on the selection rules for electric dipole transitions, which require Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. The process involves two steps: 

1. **First Transition**: From |3,0,0⟩ to an intermediate state |2,1,m₁⟩, where m₁ can be 0, +1, or -1. Each of these transitions is allowed, and the probabilities for the three possible m₁ values are assumed to be equal, giving each a probability of 1/3.

2. **Second Transition**: From the intermediate state |2,1,m₁⟩ to the final state |1,0,0⟩. For this step, the selection rules require that m₁ must change to 0. This means the second transition is only allowed if m₁ = 0. If m₁ = +1 or m₁ = -1, the transition is forbidden because the required dipole components for these cases result in zero overlap.

Thus, the only valid path is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩. The probability of this path is the product of the probabilities of the two steps. Assuming the first step has a probability of 1/3 and the second step is certain (probability = 1), the total probability for this path is 1/3. 

The other options are incorrect because they involve intermediate states with m₁ = +1 or m₁ = -1, which cannot proceed to the final state |1,0,0⟩ due to the selection rules.

**Critical Analysis of Options**:
- **Option A**: Correct. The path |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ is valid, and the probability is given as 1/3.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The path |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ is forbidden because the second transition cannot change m from +1 to 0.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The path |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ is forbidden because the second transition cannot change m from -1 to 0.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. While the path |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ is valid, the probability of 2/3 is inconsistent with the selection rules and the assumed equal probabilities for the first step.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**.

Answer: A
