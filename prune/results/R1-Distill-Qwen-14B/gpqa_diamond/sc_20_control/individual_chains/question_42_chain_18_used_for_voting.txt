Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about exoplanets and their orbital periods. I remember from my studies that the orbital period of a planet depends on its distance from the star and the mass of the star. But wait, in this problem, maybe the star's mass is similar for all planets since they’re in the same system. Oh, but the question doesn't mention the star's mass, so I guess I can assume it's the same for all three. Or maybe I don't need it because we're comparing the planets.

The problem says the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3 it's about 2.3. So, T1/T2 = 1.4 and T2/T3 = 2.3. Wait, equilibrium temperature... I think the formula for equilibrium temperature is T = (L/(16πσ))*(1/(a²(1-e²)^0.5))^(1/4), but since the orbits are circular, e is zero. So T is proportional to (L/(a²))^(1/4). Oh wait, but L is the star's luminosity. Since all planets orbit the same star, L is the same for all. So T is proportional to a^(-1/2), because (1/a²)^(1/4) is a^(-1/2).

So if T1/T2 = 1.4, then (a2/a1)^(-1/2) = 1.4. Let me think: T ∝ a^(-1/2), so T1 = T2 * (a2/a1)^(-1/2). So 1.4 = (a2/a1)^(-1/2) → (a2/a1) = (1/1.4)^2. Hmm, let me compute that. 1.4 is 14/10, so (10/14)^2 = (5/7)^2 ≈ 25/49 ≈ 0.51. So a2 is about 0.51 times a1. Wait, but that would mean Planet2 is closer to the star than Planet1? Because lower a means closer. But wait, equilibrium temperature increases as you get closer. If T1 is higher than T2, that would mean Planet1 is closer. Wait, no: T ∝ a^(-1/2). So if T1 > T2, then a1 < a2. Oh wait, no. Let me think again. The equilibrium temperature formula is T = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ d^2) ) ]^(1/4). So if a planet is closer (smaller d), T is higher. So if T1 > T2, then a1 < a2. So Planet1 is closer than Planet2. 

Wait, but the given ratio is T1/T2 = 1.4. So T1 is 1.4 times T2. So from T1 = T2 * (a2/a1)^(-1/2), rearranged, (a2/a1) = (T2/T1)^2. Since T1 is bigger than T2, T2/T1 would be 1/1.4 ≈ 0.714. So (a2/a1) = (0.714)^2 ≈ 0.51. So a2 is about 0.51 a1. So Planet2 is at about half the distance of Planet1. Hmm, that seems a bit counterintuitive, but maybe that's correct.

Wait, maybe I should write it more carefully. Let me think: T1 = [ L (1 - a) / (16 π σ (a1)^2) ]^(1/4). Similarly, T2 = [ L (1 - a) / (16 π σ (a2)^2) ]^(1/4). So the ratio T1/T2 = [ (a2^2) / (a1^2) ]^(1/4 ). So [ (a2/a1)^2 ]^(1/4 ) = (a2/a1)^(1/2). So T1/T2 = (a2/a1)^(1/2). So if T1/T2 is 1.4, then 1.4 = sqrt(a2/a1). So square both sides: 1.96 = a2/a1 → a2 = 1.96 a1. Wait, that's the opposite of what I thought earlier. Oh wait, I think I messed up the formula. Let me re-derive it.

The equilibrium temperature equation is given by:

T = [ (L (1 - A) ) / (16 π σ d^2) ) ]^(1/4).

So the formula is T ∝ (1/d)^½, because (d^2) in the denominator, and we take the 1/4 power. So T ∝ d^(-1/2).

So, if T1 = T2 * (d2/d1)^(-1/2), then T1/T2 = (d2/d1)^(-1/2). So T1/T2 = (d1/d2)^(1/2). So, if T1 is bigger than T2, then d1 is smaller than d2. So Planet1 is closer to the star than Planet2.

So the ratio T1/T2 is 1.4, so (d1/d2)^(1/2) = 1.4 → d1/d2 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So d2 = d1 / 1.96 ≈ 0.51 * d1. So Planet2 is at about half the distance of Planet1.

Wait, no. Because d1 is the distance of Planet1, d2 is the distance of Planet2. So d2 = d1 / 1.96. So Planet2 is closer than Planet1. No, wait: 1.96 is greater than 1. So 1/1.96 is approximately 0.51. So d2 = 0.51 d1. So Planet2 is at 51% of the distance of Planet1. So Planet2 is closer to the star than Planet1.

So now, the first part gives us a2 = a1 / 1.96.

Similarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is T2/T3 = 2.3. Using the same logic, T2/T3 = (d3/d2)^(1/2). So 2.3 = sqrt(d3/d2) → d3/d2 = (2.3)^2 ≈5.29 → d3 = 5.29 d2.

So now, let's write down all the distances in terms of d1.

We have d2 = d1 / 1.96.

Then, d3 =5.29 * d2 =5.29 * (d1/1.96) → 5.29/1.96 is approximately 2.699. So d3 ≈ 2.7 d1.

So now, the distances are:

d1, d2 = d1/1.96, d3 = 2.7 d1.

Next, the problem gives the mass ratios. The mass of Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15. So M1/M2 =1.15 → M2 = M1 / 1.15 ≈0.8696 M1.

Similarly, M2/M3 =1.35 → M3 = M2 /1.35. Substituting M2 from above: M3= (0.8696 M1) /1.35 ≈0.643 M1.

Wait, but I'm not sure how the masses factor into the orbital period. The orbital period depends on the mass of the star and the semi-major axis. Oh wait, Kepler's third law! The period squared is proportional to a^3 divided by the mass of the star. But wait, Kepler's law in the context of a planet orbiting a star is P^2 = (4π²/G(Mstar)) * a^3. So if all planets are orbiting the same star, then Mstar is the same for all.

So, P^2 = (4π²/(G Mstar)) * a^3. So P is proportional to a^(3/2).

So the ratio of P3 to P1 would be (a3/a1)^(3/2).

So now, a3 is approximately 2.7 a1. So P3/P1 = (2.7)^(3/2).

Let me compute that. 2.7^(3/2) is the same as sqrt(2.7^3). Let's compute 2.7^3. 2.7 *2.7=7.29. 7.29 *2.7 ≈19.683. The square root of 19.683 is approximately 4.436. So P3 is about 4.436 times P1. So looking at the options, option C is ~4.4, which would be close.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. Because a3 is 2.7 times a1, so the cube is (2.7)^3 = 19.683. Square root of that is ~4.436. So the factor is approximately 4.436, which is about 4.4. So the answer should be option C.

Wait a second, but I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation of a3. Let me recheck. Let me go through the steps again.

From T1 and T2: T1/T2 =1.4 = sqrt( a2/a1 ), so a2 = (1.4)^2 * a1 =1.96 a1. So Wait, no, wait: T1 is higher than T2, so a2 is smaller than a1. Because T is higher when closer (smaller a). So when T1 is bigger than T2, a2 must be smaller than a1. So earlier, I thought that a2 = a1 /1.96 because d2 = d1/1.96. Because the ratio T1/T2 is 1.4, which equals sqrt(a2/a1). So 1.4 = sqrt(a2/a1) → a2 = a1 * (1.4)^2 = a1 *1.96. Wait, that can't be right because that would mean a2 is larger than a1, which would make T2 lower than T1. But wait, if a2 is larger, then T2 would be lower, which aligns with T1 > T2. Oh wait, no! Because T ∝ 1/sqrt(a). So if a increases, T decreases. So if a2 is larger than a1, then T2 would be less than T1, which is correct. So yeah, T1 is higher than T2 because a2 is larger than a1. So wait, that's the opposite of what I thought earlier. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let's re-derive: T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ). So if T1 is larger than T2, then sqrt(a2/a1) >1. So a2/a1 >1 → a2 > a1. So Planet2 is farther out than Planet1. So Planet1 is closer, higher temperature.

So that makes sense. So a2 is 1.96 a1, so Planet2 is 1.96 times farther from the star than Planet1.

Now, for Planet3: T2/T3=2.3. So T2 > T3 → a3 > a2.

So using T2/T3 = sqrt( a3/a2 ) → 2.3 = sqrt( a3/a2 ) → a3 = (2.3)^2 * a2 =5.29 a2.

So now, let's compute a3 in terms of a1.

a2=1.96 a1, so a3=5.29 * 1.96 a1 ≈5.29 *1.96 = let's compute that. 5 *1.96 is 9.8, 0.29*1.96≈ 0.5684. So total is 9.8 +0.5684=10.3684. So a3=10.3684 a1. Approximately 10.37 a1.

Now, the period P is proportional to a^(3/2). So P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2) = (10.37)^(3/2).

Let me compute 10.37^(1.5). 10.37^1 is 10.37. sqrt(10.37) is approximately 3.22. So 10.37 *3.22 ≈ 33.33.

Wait, so P3 is about 33.3 times P1. But looking at the options, option D is ~33.4. So that's the correct answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the a3 calculation? Let me recheck. a2 is 1.96 a1, and a3 is 5.29 * a2 → 5.29 * 1.96 a1.

Compute 5.29 *1.96:

Well, 5 *1.96=9.8. 0.29 *1.96=0.5684. Adding together gives 10.3684, so a3≈10.3684 a1.

So (a3/a1) =10.3684.

Then, (a3/a1)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^(1.5) = sqrt(10.3684^3).

Calculate 10.3684^3:

10^3=1000.

0.3684^3 is about 0.0505. But wait, perhaps better to compute 10.3684^2 first.

10.3684^1 =10.3684.

10.3684^2 = (10 + 0.3684)^2 = 100 + 2*10*0.3684 + (0.3684)^2 = 100 +7.368 +0.1357 ≈107.5037.

Then 10.3684^3 =10.3684 * 107.5037. Let me compute 10 *107.5037=1075.037. 0.3684 *107.5037≈39.6. So total is approximately 1075 +39.6≈1114.6.

So sqrt(1114.6) is approximately 33.38, which is about 33.4. So P3 is about 33.4 times P1. So the answer is option D.

Wait, but wait another thing. The masses of the planets—how does that affect the orbital period? Because in reality, the mass of the planet would influence the star's orbit around the system's barycenter, but for Kepler's third law when considering the planet's period, the formula is based on the star's mass, not the planet's. Because the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star. So in the formula P^2 = (4π² G(Mstar + Mplanet))^-1 a^3. But if Mplanet is much smaller than Mstar, we can ignore it. So Mplanet doesn't significantly affect the period. So the given mass ratios probably don't affect the answer. So the answer is option D, 33.4.

Wait, but wait again. Did we account for all the factors correctly? Let's double-check. 

Yes, because the problem says the albedos are the same, so we can ignore that factor. The L (star's luminosity) is same for all. So the T ratios directly give the a ratios via T ∝ a^(-1/2). So the distances are correctly calculated. Period is P ~ a^(3/2), so with a3 ~10.37 a1, P3 ~ 33.4 P1. So the correct answer should be D.

To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we analyze the given data and apply Kepler's third law. The equilibrium temperature of a planet is proportional to \( a^{-1/2} \), where \( a \) is the semi-major axis. Using the given temperature ratios, we calculate the distances of the planets from the star. The orbital period is proportional to \( a^{3/2} \), allowing us to compute the ratio of the periods.

### Step 1: Relating temperature to distance
The equilibrium temperature is given by \( T \propto a^{-1/2} \). For Planet1 and Planet2:
\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = 1.4 = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} \implies \frac{a_2}{a_1} = (1.4)^2 = 1.96 \implies a_2 = 1.96 a_1
\]
This means Planet2 is farther from the star than Planet1.

For Planet2 and Planet3:
\[
\frac{T_2}{T_3} = 2.3 = \sqrt{\frac{a_3}{a_2}} \implies \frac{a_3}{a_2} = (2.3)^2 = 5.29 \implies a_3 = 5.29 a_2
\]
Substituting \( a_2 = 1.96 a_1 \):
\[
a_3 = 5.29 \times 1.96 a_1 \approx 10.37 a_1
\]

### Step 2: Relating orbital period to distance
Kepler's third law states \( P^2 \propto a^3 \), so the ratio of orbital periods is:
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left(\frac{a_3}{a_1}\right)^{3/2}
\]
Substituting \( a_3 = 10.37 a_1 \):
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.37)^{3/2} = \sqrt{10.37^3}
\]
First, calculate \( 10.37^3 \):
\[
10.37^3 \approx 1114.6
\]
Then, take the square root:
\[
\sqrt{1114.6} \approx 33.4
\]

### Conclusion
The orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1. This corresponds to option **D**.

Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about exoplanets and their orbital periods. I remember from my studies that the orbital period of a planet depends on its distance from the star and the mass of the star.

Oh, but the question doesn't mention the star's mass, so I guess I can assume it's the same for all three. Or maybe I don't need it because we're comparing the planets.

The problem says the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3 it's about 2.3. So, T1/T2 = 1.4 and T2/T3 = 2.3. Wait, equilibrium temperature... I think the formula for equilibrium temperature is T = (L/(16πσ))*(1/(a²(1-e²)^0.5))^(1/4), but since the orbits are circular, e is zero. So T is proportional to (L/(a²))^(1/4). Oh wait, but L is the star's luminosity. Since all planets orbit the same star, L is the same for all. So T is proportional to a^(-1/2), because (1/a²)^(1/4) is a^(-1/2).

So if T1/T2 = 1.4, then (a2/a1)^(-1/2) = 1.4. Let me think: T ∝ a^(-1/2), so T1 = T2 * (a2/a1)^(-1/2). So 1.4 = (a2/a1)^(-1/2) → (a2/a1) = (1/1.4)^2. Hmm, let me compute that. 1.4 is 14/10, so (10/14)^2 = (5/7)^2 ≈ 25/49 ≈ 0.51. So a2 is about 0.51 times a1. Wait, but that would mean Planet2 is closer to the star than Planet1? Because lower a means closer. But wait, equilibrium temperature increases as you get closer. If T1 is higher than T2, that would mean Planet1 is closer. Wait, no: T ∝ a^(-1/2). So if T1 > T2, then a1 < a2. Oh wait, no. Let me think again. The equilibrium temperature formula is T = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ d^2) ) ]^(1/4). So if a planet is closer (smaller d), T is higher. So if T1 > T2, then a1 < a2. So Planet1 is closer than Planet2. 

Wait, but the given ratio is T1/T2 = 1.4. So T1 is 1.4 times T2. So from T1 = T2 * (a2/a1)^(-1/2), rearranged, (a2/a1) = (T2/T1)^2. Since T1 is bigger than T2, T2/T1 would be 1/1.4 ≈ 0.714. So (a2/a1) = (0.714)^2 ≈ 0.51. So a2 is about 0.51 a1. So Planet2 is at about half the distance of Planet1. Hmm, that seems a bit counterintuitive, but maybe that's correct.

Wait, maybe I should write it more carefully. Let me think: T1 = [ L (1 - a) / (16 π σ (a1)^2) ]^(1/4). Similarly, T2 = [ L (1 - a) / (16 π σ (a2)^2) ]^(1/4). So the ratio T1/T2 = [ (a2^2) / (a1^2) ]^(1/4 ). So [ (a2/a1)^2 ]^(1/4 ) = (a2/a1)^(1/2). So T1/T2 = (a2/a1)^(1/2). So if T1/T2 is 1.4, then 1.4 = sqrt(a2/a1). So square both sides: 1.96 = a2/a1 → a2 = 1.96 a1. Wait, that's the opposite of what I thought earlier. Oh wait, I think I messed up the formula. Let me re-derive it.

The equilibrium temperature equation is given by:

T = [ (L (1 - A) ) / (16 π σ d^2) ) ]^(1/4).

So the formula is T ∝ (1/d)^½, because (d^2) in the denominator, and we take the 1/4 power. So T ∝ d^(-1/2).

So, if T1 = T2 * (d2/d1)^(-1/2), then T1/T2 = (d2/d1)^(-1/2). So T1/T2 = (d1/d2)^(1/2). So, if T1 is bigger than T2, then d1 is smaller than d2. So Planet1 is closer to the star than Planet2.

So the ratio T1/T2 is 1.4, so (d1/d2)^(1/2) = 1.4 → d1/d2 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So d2 = d1 / 1.96 ≈ 0.51 * d1. So Planet2 is at about half the distance of Planet1.

Wait, no. Because d1 is the distance of Planet1, d2 is the distance of Planet2. So d2 = d1 / 1.96. So Planet2 is closer than Planet1. No, wait: 1.96 is greater than 1. So 1/1.96 is approximately 0.51. So d2 = 0.51 d1. So Planet2 is at 51% of the distance of Planet1. So Planet2 is closer to the star than Planet1.

So now, the first part gives us a2 = a1 / 1.96.

Similarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is T2/T3 = 2.3. Using the same logic, T2/T3 = (d3/d2)^(1/2). So 2.3 = sqrt(d3/d2) → d3/d2 = (2.3)^2 ≈5.29 → d3 = 5.29 d2.

So now, let's write down all the distances in terms of d1.

We have d2 = d1 / 1.96.

Then, d3 =5.29 * d2 =5.29 * (d1/1.96) → 5.29/1.96 is approximately 2.699. So d3 ≈ 2.7 d1.

So now, the distances are:

d1, d2 = d1/1.96, d3 = 2.7 d1.

Next, the problem gives the mass ratios. The mass of Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15. So M1/M2 =1.15 → M2 = M1 / 1.15 ≈0.8696 M1.

Similarly, M2/M3 =1.35 → M3 = M2 /1.35. Substituting M2 from above: M3= (0.8696 M1) /1.35 ≈0.643 M1.

Wait, but I'm not sure how the masses factor into the orbital period. The orbital period depends on the mass of the star and the semi-major axis. Oh wait, Kepler's third law! The period squared is proportional to a^3 divided by the mass of the star. But wait, Kepler's law in the context of a planet orbiting a star is P^2 = (4π²/G(Mstar)) * a^3. So if all planets are orbiting the same star, then Mstar is the same for all.

So, P^2 = (4π²/(G Mstar)) * a^3. So P is proportional to a^(3/2).

So the ratio of P3 to P1 would be (a3/a1)^(3/2).

So now, a3 is approximately 2.7 a1. So P3/P1 = (2.7)^(3/2).

Let me compute that. 2.7^(3/2) is the same as sqrt(2.7^3). Let's compute 2.7^3. 2.7 *2.7=7.29. 7.29 *2.7 ≈19.683. The square root of 19.683 is approximately 4.436. So P3 is about 4.436 times P1. So looking at the options, option C is ~4.4, which would be close.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. Because a3 is 2.7 times a1, so the cube is (2.7)^3 = 19.683. Square root of that is ~4.436. So the factor is approximately 4.436, which is about 4.4. So the answer should be option C.

Wait a second, but I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation of a3. Let me recheck. Let me go through the steps again.

From T1 and T2: T1/T2 =1.4 = sqrt( a2/a1 ), so a2 = (1.4)^2 * a1 =1.96 a1. So Wait, no, wait: T1 is higher than T2, so a2 is smaller than a1. Because T is higher when closer (smaller a). So when T1 is bigger than T2, a2 must be smaller than a1. So earlier, I thought that a2 = a1 /1.96 because d2 = d1/1.96. Because the ratio T1/T2 is 1.4, which equals sqrt(a2/a1). So 1.4 = sqrt(a2/a1) → a2 = a1 * (1.4)^2 = a1 *1.96. Wait, that can't be right because that would mean a2 is larger than a1, which would make T2 lower than T1. But wait, if a2 is larger, then T2 would be lower, which aligns with T1 > T2. Oh wait, no! Because T ∝ 1/sqrt(a). So if a increases, T decreases. So if a2 is larger than a1, then T2 would be less than T1, which is correct. So yeah, T1 is higher than T2 because a2 is larger than a1. So wait, that's the opposite of what I thought earlier. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let's re-derive: T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ). So if T1 is larger than T2, then sqrt(a2/a1) >1. So a2/a1 >1 → a2 > a1. So Planet2 is farther out than Planet1. So Planet1 is closer, higher temperature.

So that makes sense. So a2 is 1.96 a1, so Planet2 is 1.96 times farther from the star than Planet1.

Now, for Planet3: T2/T3=2.3. So T2 > T3 → a3 > a2.

So using T2/T3 = sqrt( a3/a2 ) → 2.3 = sqrt( a3/a2 ) → a3 = (2.3)^2 * a2 =5.29 a2.

So now, let's compute a3 in terms of a1.

a2=1.96 a1, so a3=5.29 * 1.96 a1 ≈5.29 *1.96 = let's compute that. 5 *1.96 is 9.8, 0.29*1.96≈ 0.5684. So total is 9.8 +0.5684=10.3684. So a3=10.3684 a1. Approximately 10.37 a1.

Now, the period P is proportional to a^(3/2). So P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2) = (10.37)^(3/2).

Let me compute 10.37^(1.5). 10.37^1 is 10.37. sqrt(10.37) is approximately 3.22. So 10.37 *3.22 ≈ 33.33.

Wait, so P3 is about 33.3 times P1. But looking at the options, option D is ~33.4. So that's the correct answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the a3 calculation? Let me recheck. a2 is 1.96 a1, and a3 is 5.29 * a2 → 5.29 * 1.96 a1.

Compute 5.29 *1.96:

Well, 5 *1.96=9.8. 0.29 *1.96=0.5684. Adding together gives 10.3684, so a3≈10.3684 a1.

So (a3/a1) =10.3684.

Then, (a3/a1)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^(1.5) = sqrt(10.3684^3).

Calculate 10.3684^3:

10^3=1000.

0.3684^3 is about 0.0505. But wait, perhaps better to compute 10.3684^2 first.

10.3684^1 =10.3684.

10.3684^2 = (10 + 0.3684)^2 = 100 + 2*10*0.3684 + (0.3684)^2 = 100 +7.368 +0.1357 ≈107.5037.

Then 10.3684^3 =10.3684 * 107.5037. Let me compute 10 *107.5037=1075.037. 0.3684 *107.5037≈39.6. So total is approximately 1075 +39.6≈1114.6.

So sqrt(1114.6) is approximately 33.38, which is about 33.4. So P3 is about 33.4 times P1. So the answer is option D.

Wait, but wait another thing. The masses of the planets—how does that affect the orbital period? Because in reality, the mass of the planet would influence the star's orbit around the system's barycenter, but for Kepler's third law when considering the planet's period, the formula is based on the star's mass, not the planet's. Because the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star. So in the formula P^2 = (4π² G(Mstar + Mplanet))^-1 a^3. But if Mplanet is much smaller than Mstar, we can ignore it. So Mplanet doesn't significantly affect the period. So the given mass ratios probably don't affect the answer. So the answer is option D, 33.4.

Wait, but wait again. Did we account for all the factors correctly? Let's double-check. 

Yes, because the problem says the albedos are the same, so we can ignore that factor. The L (star's luminosity) is same for all. So the T ratios directly give the a ratios via T ∝ a^(-1/2). So the distances are correctly calculated. Period is P ~ a^(3/2), so with a3 ~10.37 a1, P3 ~ 33.4 P1. So the correct answer should be D.


To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we analyze the given data and apply Kepler's third law. The equilibrium temperature of a planet is proportional to \( a^{-1/2} \), where \( a \) is the semi-major axis. Using the given temperature ratios, we calculate the distances of the planets from the star. The orbital period is proportional to \( a^{3/2} \), allowing us to compute the ratio of the periods.

### Step 1: Relating temperature to distance
The equilibrium temperature is given by \( T \propto a^{-1/2} \). For Planet1 and Planet2:
\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = 1.4 = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} \implies \frac{a_2}{a_1} = (1.4)^2 = 1.96 \implies a_2 = 1.96 a_1
\]
This means Planet2 is farther from the star than Planet1.

For Planet2 and Planet3:
\[
\frac{T_2}{T_3} = 2.3 = \sqrt{\frac{a_3}{a_2}} \implies \frac{a_3}{a_2} = (2.3)^2 = 5.29 \implies a_3 = 5.29 a_2
\]
Substituting \( a_2 = 1.96 a_1 \):
\[
a_3 = 5.29 \times 1.96 a_1 \approx 10.37 a_1
\]

### Step 2: Relating orbital period to distance
Kepler's third law states \( P^2 \propto a^3 \), so the ratio of orbital periods is:
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left(\frac{a_3}{a_1}\right)^{3/2}
\]
Substituting \( a_3 = 10.37 a_1 \):
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.37)^{3/2} = \sqrt{10.37^3}
\]
First, calculate \( 10.37^3 \):
\[
10.37^3 \approx 1114.6
\]
Then, take the square root:
\[
\sqrt{1114.6} \approx 33.4
\]

### Conclusion
The orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1. This corresponds to option **D**.
