Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it again and try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with benzene. Let's go through each step one by one.

First reaction: Benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4. I remember that this is a nitration reaction. Benzene undergoes electrophilic substitution with nitric acid as the nitronium ion (NO2+) is the electrophile. The nitration of benzene typically occurs at the meta position if there are no other substituents, but wait, benzene itself is symmetric, so the product will be nitrobenzene, which is a single product. So product 1 is nitrobenzene.

Second reaction: Product 1 (nitrobenzene) is treated with Br2 and iron powder. Hmm, I think this is a bromination via the Sandmeyer reaction or maybe a substitution. Wait, iron and Br2 usually are used for aromatic substitution. Oh wait, nitro groups are strong meta directors. So when nitrobenzene undergoes bromination, the Br should enter at the meta position relative to the nitro group. Wait, but wait, nitro is a meta-directing group. So the first product is nitrobenzene, then bromine comes in meta to nitro. So product 2 would be meta-bromonitrobenzene, right? So structure would be nitro group at position 1, Br at position 3. Wait, benzene is a ring, so numbering can be tricky. Let me think: nitro is at position 1, bromine would be at position 3. So the substituents are nitro (para to bromine?), no, wait. Wait, the nitro group is at position 1. When you add Br, it's meta to nitro. Let me think about the structure. Nitro is at position 1. The possible meta positions are 3 and 5. But in nitrobenzene, the ring is symmetric, so adding Br at 3 would give the same as 5, so only one product. So product 2 is 3-bromo-nitrobenzene.

Third reaction: Product 2 is stirred with Pd/C under hydrogen. That's hydrogenation. So the nitro group (NO2) would be reduced. Nitro groups reduce to amino groups. So product 3 would be 3-bromoaniline. Structure is benzene ring with NH2 at position 1 and Br at position 3.

Fourth reaction: Product 3 (3-bromoaniline) is treated with NaNO2 and HBF4. Hmm, I think this is a diazotization reaction. Diazotization typically converts an aromatic amine to a diazonium salt. Since the solution is acidic (HBF4 is a strong acid), the amine would be protonated, then react with NaNO2 at low temperature (like 0-5Â°C) to form the diazonium chloride. So product 4 is the diazonium salt: 3-bromo-benzenediazonium chloride. The structure would be benzene with Br at position 3 and the diazonium group (N2+Cl-) at position 1.

Fifth reaction: Product 4 is heated and then treated with anisole. Heating a diazonium salt typically leads to a coupling reaction. But wait, anisole is methoxybenzene. So the diazonium salt could undergo a coupling reaction with anisole. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution. Wait, another possibility: when a diazonium salt is treated with an activating group like anisole, perhaps it's a cross-coupling. Alternatively, maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation, but wait, anisole is OMe, which is a strong activating group. Another possibility is that the diazonium salt acts as an electrophile in a coupling reaction. Let me think about the mechanism.

Wait, when a diazonium salt is heated with an aromatic compound that has an activating group, like anisole, it can undergo a coupling reaction. For example, the diazonium salt can lose nitrogen and the aromatic ring can couple with the other ring. So in this case, the benzene ring from the diazonium salt (which has Br at position 3) would couple with the anisole (MeO-benzene). So the coupling would form biphenyl structure.

Alternatively, maybe the diazonium group is replaced by another substituent. Oh wait, when a diazonium salt is treated with a strongly activating ring (like anisole), the aromatic ring can undergo a coupling, where the diazonium group loses N2 and the ring connects to the other ring. So the product would be biphenyl with substituents.

Let me think about how the substituents arrange. The original product 4 is 3-bromo-benzenediazonium chloride. So the benzene ring has Br at position 3 and the diazonium group at position 1. When coupling occurs, the position where the coupling happens depends on the directing groups. Anisole has a methoxy group, which is a strong activating, ortho/para director. So when the coupling occurs, the new ring (from the diazonium salt) will attach to the anisole ring at positions ortho or para to the OMe group.

Wait, but the coupling of benzene diazonium salts typically leads to the formation of biphenyl where the new ring connects to the existing ring. So the position on the anisole ring where the biphenyl forms depends on the directing effect.

Anisole has OMe as a substituent. So the OMe is at position 1, say. Then, the diazonium ring (when coupling) would attach at position 2 or 4 (ortho or para) to OMe. But wait, what's the structure of anisole? It's a benzene ring with OMe group attached. So when the coupling occurs, the new ring (from the diazonium) will add to the anisole ring. The position of attachment is determined by the directing groups.

In the case of anisole, the OMe is activating, so the incoming electrophile (the benzene ring from the diazonium) would attack at ortho or para positions relative to OMe. So the coupling would occur either at position 2 or 4 of the anisole ring.

Wait, but the coupling reaction of the diazonium salt (like in the Sandmeyer reaction) leads to substitution. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that's less likely here. Alternatively, it's a coupling where the two rings join.

Wait, let me think again. The benzene ring (from the diazonium salt) will lose the diazonium group and form a bond with the anisole ring. The position of this bond depends on the directing of the substituents.

In the anisole molecule, the OMe group is at a certain position. Let's say OMe is at position 1. The incoming ring (from the diazonium) can attach at position 2, 4, or maybe even another position based on the meta/para directors.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the positions of substitution on each ring. Let me try to imagine the structure.

The original benzene ring (from the diazonium salt) has Br at position 3 and the diazonium at position 1. When it couples with anisole, the two rings will form a biphenyl structure.

Anisole is OMe-substituted benzene. Let's imagine that the OMe is at position 1 of the anisole ring. Then, where does the coupling occur? The OMe group is a strong activating group, so the coupling (which is an electrophilic substitution) would occur either at position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para) relative to OMe.

But wait, the coupling in this context is more about the ring where the diazonium is. So the benzene ring from the diazonium will attach to the anisole ring at a position where the OMe directs. So, the OMe directs the incoming ring to attach at positions ortho or para to itself.

Alternatively, perhaps the coupling occurs at the position where the diazonium group was, but since the diazonium is on the benzene ring, when it's coupled, the ring attaches in a specific way.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the positions more carefully.

Original diazonium ring: positions are 1 (diazonium) and 3 (Br). So when the ring loses N2, it becomes a benzene ring with Br at position 3. Then, it couples to the anisole ring.

Anisole has OMe at position 1. So when the coupling occurs, the benzene ring (with Br at 3) will attach to the anisole ring at either position 2 or 4 (ortho or para to OMe).

So the biphenyl structure would have the OMe at position 1 of one ring, and the other ring attached at position 2 or 4.

Wait, but in the final product, the substituents are on the biphenyl rings. So if the anisole's OMe is in position 1, and the coupling occurs at position 2, then the other ring is attached there.

Wait, maybe the biphenyl structure is such that one ring has OMe, and the other has Br. So the substituents would be on the same or opposite positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the biphenyl structure has the Br on one ring and the OMe on the other.

Wait, perhaps the product is 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl. Let's see: the main ring (from the diazonium) would have Br at position 3, and the other ring (anisole) has OMe at position 1. When coupled, the main ring would attach to the para position of the OMe, making the OMe at position 4' of the biphenyl. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should draw it out mentally.

Let me number the anisole's ring as positions 1 (OMe), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. The coupling occurs at position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para) relative to OMe. Let's say it's position 4, the para position.

So the coupling would form a bond between the diazonium ring's position 1 and the anisole's position 4. Wait, no, because the coupling connects two rings. Let me think: the benzene ring from the diazonium salt (with Br at 3) will attach to the anisole ring in such a way that the position where it attaches is ortho or para to OMe.

Wait, perhaps the main ring (from the diazonium) is attached to the anisole ring at position 4 (para to OMe). Then, the main ring has Br at position 3 relative to the attachment point. So in the biphenyl, the main ring is attached to position 4 of anisole, and on that main ring, the Br is at position 3 relative to the attachment point.

So, in biphenyl terms, the attachment is at position 1 of the main ring and position 4' of the anisole ring. No, not quite. Let me think in terms of the biphenyl structure.

The biphenyl has two benzene rings connected by a single bond. Let's say the anisole ring is one ring, with OMe at position 1. The other ring (from the diazonium) is attached to it at position 4. So the main ring (from the diazonium) has Br at position 3 relative to the point of attachment.

So the structure would be:

Anisole ring: OMe at position 1, connected to position 4 of the other ring. The other ring (from diazonium) has Br at position 3, which is three positions away from the connection point (since the connection is position 1 of the diazonium ring and position 4 of the anisole ring).

Wait, maybe it's better to imagine the two rings as 1,1'-biphenyl. The anisole is the first ring, with OMe at position 1. The diazonium ring is the second ring. The diazonium ring (previously nitro and then bromo) has Br at position 3.

But wait, when the diazonium ring is attached to the anisole ring, the point of attachment on the diazonium ring is at position 1. So the other substituents (Br) would be at position 3 on the same ring.

In the biphenyl, this would mean that the OMe is on the first ring (position 1), and the Br is on the second ring, position 3 relative to the connection (so position 3 on the second ring). So the positions on the biphenyl are 1 (OMe) and 3 (Br) on the adjacent rings.

Wait, but the numbering of biphenyl structures can be tricky. For example, the first ring is connected at position 1, and the second ring is connected at position 1 as well. So the substituents on each ring are numbered relative to their own ring.

So in this case, the anisole ring has OMe at position 1, and the other ring (from the diazonium) has Br at position 3. So the biphenyl would be 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl? Or perhaps 3-bromo-3'-methoxy?

Wait, no. Let me think again. If the coupling occurs such that the diazonium ring (with Br at position 3) is attached to the anisole ring's position 4 (para to OMe), then the biphenyl structure would have OMe at position 4' and Br at position 3 on the first ring.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to visualize it.

Anisole ring: OMe is at position 1. The coupling occurs at position 4 (para to OMe). The other ring (diazonium) is attached there. So the biphenyl has the OMe at position 4' of the second ring. The other ring (diazonium) has Br at position 3 relative to the connection point (which is position 1 on that ring).

Wait, perhaps the numbering is such that the anisole is ring A, with OMe at position 1. The other ring (ring B) is connected at position 1 of ring A. On ring B, the Br is at position 3.

So in the biphenyl, ring A has OMe at 1, and ring B is connected at 1. On ring B, Br is at position 3. So the structure would be biphenyl with OMe at 1 and Br at 3 of ring B.

But the options don't seem to match this exactly. Let me look at the options.

Options are:

A) 3-bromo-4'-fluoro-1,1'-biphenyl

B) 3'-bromo-2-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl

C) 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl

D)4-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl

Hmm. So option C is 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl. That would imply that ring B (the former diazonium ring) has Br at position 3, and the anisole's OMe is at position 4' of ring A.

Wait, but when the coupling happens, the OMe is at position 4' relative to the connection point.

Wait, in biphenyl nomenclature, the substituents are numbered across both rings. So, if the biphenyl is 1,1'-biphenyl (i.e., the two rings are connected at position 1 of each), then substituents are numbered on each ring in a way that gives the lowest possible numbers.

So if the anisole ring has OMe at position 1, and the other ring has Br at position 3, then the biphenyl would be 3-bromo-1-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl? But that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps I got the substituents on the wrong rings. Because the anisole is the one being treated with the diazonium salt. So maybe the diazonium ring is the main ring, and the anisole becomes the substituent.

Wait, perhaps the product is a biphenyl where the anisole ring is attached to the main ring. Let me think: the main ring comes from the diazonium salt, which has Br at position 3. So when the coupling occurs, the main ring (with Br at position 3) is attached to the anisole ring. The OMe is on the anisole ring.

So in the biphenyl, the main ring (ring B) is connected at position 1 to ring A (anisole). Ring A has OMe at position 1, but when connected, the substituents on ring A would be at position 4 if attached at position 1.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me think again.

The anisole is the nucleophile or the electrophilic part? In the coupling reaction, the diazonium ring acts as the electrophilic part, and the anisole ring is activated towards the incoming electrophile.

Wait, in a typical coupling reaction, the diazonium group is converted into a good leaving group (like N2), and the benzene ring (from the diazonium) acts as an electrophile. The anisole ring, being activated, undergoes electrophilic substitution.

So the benzene ring (from the diazonium) will substitute into the anisole ring at an ortho or para position relative to the OMe group.

So the anisole ring has OMe at position 1. The incoming benzene ring (with Br at position 3) will attach at position 2 or 4.

If it attaches at position 4, the Br is in position 3 of the incoming ring, which would be position 4 on the biphenyl. So the structure would have OMe at position 4' of the biphenyl.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl. That's option C.

Alternatively, let's think about the positions. The biphenyl is connected at position 1 of each ring. The anisole's OMe is at position 1 of ring A, and the other ring (ring B, from diazonium) is connected at position 1.

Ring B has Br at position 3. So in the biphenyl, ring B's Br is at position 3, which is three positions away from the connection point (which is position 1).

So the final structure would be 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl. Which is option C.

Wait, but why 4'? Because the OMe is on ring A, which is connected at position 1. So the OMe is on ring A at position 1, and the Br is on ring B at position 3. So the substituents are on positions 1 and 3 of each ring.

Wait, perhaps the numbering is such that the OMe is on the first ring, position 4', and Br is on the first ring position 3. Or I might be mixing up the numbering.

Alternatively, perhaps I should draw the structure.

Imagine the biphenyl as two benzene rings connected at position 1 of each. On the first ring (ring A), there's an OMe group at position 4. On the second ring (ring B), there's a Br at position 3.

But wait, that would make the structure 3-bromo-4-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl, which is option C.

Yes, that makes sense. So the final product has OMe on ring A at position 4, and Br on ring B at position 3.

Wait, but why ring A is considered the first ring and ring B the second? Maybe it doesn't matter as long as the substituents are correctly numbered.

So looking at the options:

Option C is 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl. So that would be Br on ring 1 at position 3, and OMe on ring 2 at position 4'. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, in biphenyl nomenclature, the substituents are numbered across the rings to give the lowest possible set of numbers. So if the main chain is the first ring, the substituents are numbered accordingly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the main ring as the one that receives the substituent. But I'm getting stuck on the numbering.

But in any case, the correct answer seems to be option C. Let me check the steps again.

1. Nitration of benzene gives nitrobenzene.

2. Bromination with Br2 and Fe gives meta-bromo nitrobenzene (3-bromonitrobenzene).

3. Reduction with Pd/C and H2 reduces nitro to amino: 3-bromoaniline.

4. Diazotization with NaNO2 and HBF4 gives 3-bromo-benzenediazonium chloride.

5. Heating and coupling with anisole: the diazonium group is replaced, and the ring attaches to anisole's ortho or para positions.

The coupling occurs at the para position of OMe (since it's a strong activating group, para is more favorable for coupling than ortho maybe?), leading to the OMe being at 4' and Br at 3.

So option C is 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with benzene, leading to the final product, a biphenyl derivative. Here's the analysis of each step:

1. **Nitration of Benzene**: Benzene reacts with HNOâ and HâSOâ to form nitrobenzene (product 1). The nitro group (-NOâ) is introduced at the meta position due to benzene's symmetry.

2. **Bromination of Nitrobenzene**: Product 1 (nitrobenzene) is treated with Brâ and Fe, leading to bromination at the meta position relative to the nitro group. This forms 3-bromonitrobenzene (product 2).

3. **Reduction of Nitrobenzene**: Product 2 (3-bromonitrobenzene) is reduced with Pd/C under Hâ. The nitro group (-NOâ) is reduced to an amino group (-NHâ), forming 3-bromoaniline (product 3).

4. **Diazotization**: Product 3 (3-bromoaniline) is treated with NaNOâ and HBFâ. The amino group is converted into a diazonium salt, forming 3-bromo-benzenediazonium chloride (product 4).

5. **Coupling with Anisole**: Product 4 is heated and treated with anisole (methoxybenzene). The diazonium group undergoes a coupling reaction with anisole. The methoxy group (-OMe) on anisole is a strong activating group and directs the coupling to occur at the para position relative to itself. This results in the formation of a biphenyl structure where the methoxy group is at position 4' and the bromine is at position 3 on the other ring.

The final product is **3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl**, which corresponds to option C.

Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it again and try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with benzene. Let's go through each step one by one.

First reaction: Benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4. I remember that this is a nitration reaction. Benzene undergoes electrophilic substitution with nitric acid as the nitronium ion (NO2+) is the electrophile. The nitration of benzene typically occurs at the meta position if there are no other substituents, but wait, benzene itself is symmetric, so the product will be nitrobenzene, which is a single product. So product 1 is nitrobenzene.

Second reaction: Product 1 (nitrobenzene) is treated with Br2 and iron powder. Hmm, I think this is a bromination via the Sandmeyer reaction or maybe a substitution. Wait, iron and Br2 usually are used for aromatic substitution. Oh wait, nitro groups are strong meta directors. So when nitrobenzene undergoes bromination, the Br should enter at the meta position relative to the nitro group. Wait, but wait, nitro is a meta-directing group. So the first product is nitrobenzene, then bromine comes in meta to nitro. So product 2 would be meta-bromonitrobenzene, right? So structure would be nitro group at position 1, Br at position 3. Wait, benzene is a ring, so numbering can be tricky. Let me think: nitro is at position 1, bromine would be at position 3. So the substituents are nitro (para to bromine?), no, wait. Wait, the nitro group is at position 1. When you add Br, it's meta to nitro. Let me think about the structure. Nitro is at position 1. The possible meta positions are 3 and 5. But in nitrobenzene, the ring is symmetric, so adding Br at 3 would give the same as 5, so only one product. So product 2 is 3-bromo-nitrobenzene.

Third reaction: Product 2 is stirred with Pd/C under hydrogen. That's hydrogenation. So the nitro group (NO2) would be reduced. Nitro groups reduce to amino groups. So product 3 would be 3-bromoaniline. Structure is benzene ring with NH2 at position 1 and Br at position 3.

Fourth reaction: Product 3 (3-bromoaniline) is treated with NaNO2 and HBF4. Hmm, I think this is a diazotization reaction. Diazotization typically converts an aromatic amine to a diazonium salt. Since the solution is acidic (HBF4 is a strong acid), the amine would be protonated, then react with NaNO2 at low temperature (like 0-5Â°C) to form the diazonium chloride. So product 4 is the diazonium salt: 3-bromo-benzenediazonium chloride. The structure would be benzene with Br at position 3 and the diazonium group (N2+Cl-) at position 1.

Fifth reaction: Product 4 is heated and then treated with anisole. Heating a diazonium salt typically leads to a coupling reaction. But wait, anisole is methoxybenzene. So the diazonium salt could undergo a coupling reaction with anisole. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution. Wait, another possibility: when a diazonium salt is treated with an activating group like anisole, perhaps it's a cross-coupling. Alternatively, maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation, but wait, anisole is OMe, which is a strong activating group. Another possibility is that the diazonium salt acts as an electrophile in a coupling reaction. Let me think about the mechanism.

Wait, when a diazonium salt is heated with an aromatic compound that has an activating group, like anisole, it can undergo a coupling reaction. For example, the diazonium salt can lose nitrogen and the aromatic ring can couple with the other ring. So in this case, the benzene ring from the diazonium salt (which has Br at position 3) would couple with the anisole (MeO-benzene). So the coupling would form biphenyl structure.

Alternatively, maybe the diazonium group is replaced by another substituent. Oh wait, when a diazonium salt is treated with a strongly activating ring (like anisole), the aromatic ring can undergo a coupling, where the diazonium group loses N2 and the ring connects to the other ring. So the product would be biphenyl with substituents.

Let me think about how the substituents arrange. The original product 4 is 3-bromo-benzenediazonium chloride. So the benzene ring has Br at position 3 and the diazonium group at position 1. When coupling occurs, the position where the coupling happens depends on the directing groups. Anisole has a methoxy group, which is a strong activating, ortho/para director. So when the coupling occurs, the new ring (from the diazonium salt) will attach to the anisole ring at positions ortho or para to the OMe group.

Wait, but the coupling of benzene diazonium salts typically leads to the formation of biphenyl where the new ring connects to the existing ring. So the position on the anisole ring where the biphenyl forms depends on the directing effect.

Anisole has OMe as a substituent. So the OMe is at position 1, say. Then, the diazonium ring (when coupling) would attach at position 2 or 4 (ortho or para) to OMe. But wait, what's the structure of anisole? It's a benzene ring with OMe group attached. So when the coupling occurs, the new ring (from the diazonium) will add to the anisole ring. The position of attachment is determined by the directing groups.

In the case of anisole, the OMe is activating, so the incoming electrophile (the benzene ring from the diazonium) would attack at ortho or para positions relative to OMe. So the coupling would occur either at position 2 or 4 of the anisole ring.

Wait, but the coupling reaction of the diazonium salt (like in the Sandmeyer reaction) leads to substitution. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that's less likely here. Alternatively, it's a coupling where the two rings join.

Wait, let me think again. The benzene ring (from the diazonium salt) will lose the diazonium group and form a bond with the anisole ring. The position of this bond depends on the directing of the substituents.

In the anisole molecule, the OMe group is at a certain position. Let's say OMe is at position 1. The incoming ring (from the diazonium) can attach at position 2, 4, or maybe even another position based on the meta/para directors.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the positions of substitution on each ring. Let me try to imagine the structure.

The original benzene ring (from the diazonium salt) has Br at position 3 and the diazonium at position 1. When it couples with anisole, the two rings will form a biphenyl structure.

Anisole is OMe-substituted benzene. Let's imagine that the OMe is at position 1 of the anisole ring. Then, where does the coupling occur? The OMe group is a strong activating group, so the coupling (which is an electrophilic substitution) would occur either at position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para) relative to OMe.

But wait, the coupling in this context is more about the ring where the diazonium is. So the benzene ring from the diazonium will attach to the anisole ring at a position where the OMe directs. So, the OMe directs the incoming ring to attach at positions ortho or para to itself.

Alternatively, perhaps the coupling occurs at the position where the diazonium group was, but since the diazonium is on the benzene ring, when it's coupled, the ring attaches in a specific way.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the positions more carefully.

Original diazonium ring: positions are 1 (diazonium) and 3 (Br). So when the ring loses N2, it becomes a benzene ring with Br at position 3. Then, it couples to the anisole ring.

Anisole has OMe at position 1. So when the coupling occurs, the benzene ring (with Br at 3) will attach to the anisole ring at either position 2 or 4 (ortho or para to OMe).

So the biphenyl structure would have the OMe at position 1 of one ring, and the other ring attached at position 2 or 4.

Wait, but in the final product, the substituents are on the biphenyl rings. So if the anisole's OMe is in position 1, and the coupling occurs at position 2, then the other ring is attached there.

Wait, maybe the biphenyl structure is such that one ring has OMe, and the other has Br. So the substituents would be on the same or opposite positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the biphenyl structure has the Br on one ring and the OMe on the other.

Wait, perhaps the product is 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl. Let's see: the main ring (from the diazonium) would have Br at position 3, and the other ring (anisole) has OMe at position 1. When coupled, the main ring would attach to the para position of the OMe, making the OMe at position 4' of the biphenyl. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should draw it out mentally.

Let me number the anisole's ring as positions 1 (OMe), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. The coupling occurs at position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para) relative to OMe. Let's say it's position 4, the para position.

So the coupling would form a bond between the diazonium ring's position 1 and the anisole's position 4. Wait, no, because the coupling connects two rings. Let me think: the benzene ring from the diazonium salt (with Br at 3) will attach to the anisole ring in such a way that the position where it attaches is ortho or para to OMe.

Wait, perhaps the main ring (from the diazonium) is attached to the anisole ring at position 4 (para to OMe). Then, the main ring has Br at position 3 relative to the attachment point. So in the biphenyl, the main ring is attached to position 4 of anisole, and on that main ring, the Br is at position 3 relative to the attachment point.

So, in biphenyl terms, the attachment is at position 1 of the main ring and position 4' of the anisole ring. No, not quite. Let me think in terms of the biphenyl structure.

The biphenyl has two benzene rings connected by a single bond. Let's say the anisole ring is one ring, with OMe at position 1. The other ring (from the diazonium) is attached to it at position 4. So the main ring (from the diazonium) has Br at position 3 relative to the point of attachment.

So the structure would be:

Anisole ring: OMe at position 1, connected to position 4 of the other ring. The other ring (from diazonium) has Br at position 3, which is three positions away from the connection point (since the connection is position 1 of the diazonium ring and position 4 of the anisole ring).

Wait, maybe it's better to imagine the two rings as 1,1'-biphenyl. The anisole is the first ring, with OMe at position 1. The diazonium ring is the second ring. The diazonium ring (previously nitro and then bromo) has Br at position 3.

But wait, when the diazonium ring is attached to the anisole ring, the point of attachment on the diazonium ring is at position 1. So the other substituents (Br) would be at position 3 on the same ring.

In the biphenyl, this would mean that the OMe is on the first ring (position 1), and the Br is on the second ring, position 3 relative to the connection (so position 3 on the second ring). So the positions on the biphenyl are 1 (OMe) and 3 (Br) on the adjacent rings.

Wait, but the numbering of biphenyl structures can be tricky. For example, the first ring is connected at position 1, and the second ring is connected at position 1 as well. So the substituents on each ring are numbered relative to their own ring.

So in this case, the anisole ring has OMe at position 1, and the other ring (from the diazonium) has Br at position 3. So the biphenyl would be 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl? Or perhaps 3-bromo-3'-methoxy?

Wait, no. Let me think again. If the coupling occurs such that the diazonium ring (with Br at position 3) is attached to the anisole ring's position 4 (para to OMe), then the biphenyl structure would have OMe at position 4' and Br at position 3 on the first ring.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to visualize it.

Anisole ring: OMe is at position 1. The coupling occurs at position 4 (para to OMe). The other ring (diazonium) is attached there. So the biphenyl has the OMe at position 4' of the second ring. The other ring (diazonium) has Br at position 3 relative to the connection point (which is position 1 on that ring).

Wait, perhaps the numbering is such that the anisole is ring A, with OMe at position 1. The other ring (ring B) is connected at position 1 of ring A. On ring B, the Br is at position 3.

So in the biphenyl, ring A has OMe at 1, and ring B is connected at 1. On ring B, Br is at position 3. So the structure would be biphenyl with OMe at 1 and Br at 3 of ring B.

But the options don't seem to match this exactly. Let me look at the options.

Options are:

A) 3-bromo-4'-fluoro-1,1'-biphenyl

B) 3'-bromo-2-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl

C) 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl

D)4-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl

Hmm. So option C is 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl. That would imply that ring B (the former diazonium ring) has Br at position 3, and the anisole's OMe is at position 4' of ring A.

Wait, but when the coupling happens, the OMe is at position 4' relative to the connection point.

Wait, in biphenyl nomenclature, the substituents are numbered across both rings. So, if the biphenyl is 1,1'-biphenyl (i.e., the two rings are connected at position 1 of each), then substituents are numbered on each ring in a way that gives the lowest possible numbers.

So if the anisole ring has OMe at position 1, and the other ring has Br at position 3, then the biphenyl would be 3-bromo-1-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl? But that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps I got the substituents on the wrong rings. Because the anisole is the one being treated with the diazonium salt. So maybe the diazonium ring is the main ring, and the anisole becomes the substituent.

Wait, perhaps the product is a biphenyl where the anisole ring is attached to the main ring. Let me think: the main ring comes from the diazonium salt, which has Br at position 3. So when the coupling occurs, the main ring (with Br at position 3) is attached to the anisole ring. The OMe is on the anisole ring.

So in the biphenyl, the main ring (ring B) is connected at position 1 to ring A (anisole). Ring A has OMe at position 1, but when connected, the substituents on ring A would be at position 4 if attached at position 1.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me think again.

The anisole is the nucleophile or the electrophilic part? In the coupling reaction, the diazonium ring acts as the electrophilic part, and the anisole ring is activated towards the incoming electrophile.

Wait, in a typical coupling reaction, the diazonium group is converted into a good leaving group (like N2), and the benzene ring (from the diazonium) acts as an electrophile. The anisole ring, being activated, undergoes electrophilic substitution.

So the benzene ring (from the diazonium) will substitute into the anisole ring at an ortho or para position relative to the OMe group.

So the anisole ring has OMe at position 1. The incoming benzene ring (with Br at position 3) will attach at position 2 or 4.

If it attaches at position 4, the Br is in position 3 of the incoming ring, which would be position 4 on the biphenyl. So the structure would have OMe at position 4' of the biphenyl.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl. That's option C.

Alternatively, let's think about the positions. The biphenyl is connected at position 1 of each ring. The anisole's OMe is at position 1 of ring A, and the other ring (ring B, from diazonium) is connected at position 1.

Ring B has Br at position 3. So in the biphenyl, ring B's Br is at position 3, which is three positions away from the connection point (which is position 1).

So the final structure would be 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl. Which is option C.

Wait, but why 4'? Because the OMe is on ring A, which is connected at position 1. So the OMe is on ring A at position 1, and the Br is on ring B at position 3. So the substituents are on positions 1 and 3 of each ring.

Wait, perhaps the numbering is such that the OMe is on the first ring, position 4', and Br is on the first ring position 3. Or I might be mixing up the numbering.

Alternatively, perhaps I should draw the structure.

Imagine the biphenyl as two benzene rings connected at position 1 of each. On the first ring (ring A), there's an OMe group at position 4. On the second ring (ring B), there's a Br at position 3.

But wait, that would make the structure 3-bromo-4-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl, which is option C.

Yes, that makes sense. So the final product has OMe on ring A at position 4, and Br on ring B at position 3.

Wait, but why ring A is considered the first ring and ring B the second? Maybe it doesn't matter as long as the substituents are correctly numbered.

So looking at the options:

Option C is 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl. So that would be Br on ring 1 at position 3, and OMe on ring 2 at position 4'. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, in biphenyl nomenclature, the substituents are numbered across the rings to give the lowest possible set of numbers. So if the main chain is the first ring, the substituents are numbered accordingly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the main ring as the one that receives the substituent. But I'm getting stuck on the numbering.

But in any case, the correct answer seems to be option C. Let me check the steps again.

1. Nitration of benzene gives nitrobenzene.

2. Bromination with Br2 and Fe gives meta-bromo nitrobenzene (3-bromonitrobenzene).

3. Reduction with Pd/C and H2 reduces nitro to amino: 3-bromoaniline.

4. Diazotization with NaNO2 and HBF4 gives 3-bromo-benzenediazonium chloride.

5. Heating and coupling with anisole: the diazonium group is replaced, and the ring attaches to anisole's ortho or para positions.

The coupling occurs at the para position of OMe (since it's a strong activating group, para is more favorable for coupling than ortho maybe?), leading to the OMe being at 4' and Br at 3.

So option C is 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with benzene, leading to the final product, a biphenyl derivative. Here's the analysis of each step:

1. **Nitration of Benzene**: Benzene reacts with HNOâ and HâSOâ to form nitrobenzene (product 1). The nitro group (-NOâ) is introduced at the meta position due to benzene's symmetry.

2. **Bromination of Nitrobenzene**: Product 1 (nitrobenzene) is treated with Brâ and Fe, leading to bromination at the meta position relative to the nitro group. This forms 3-bromonitrobenzene (product 2).

3. **Reduction of Nitrobenzene**: Product 2 (3-bromonitrobenzene) is reduced with Pd/C under Hâ. The nitro group (-NOâ) is reduced to an amino group (-NHâ), forming 3-bromoaniline (product 3).

4. **Diazotization**: Product 3 (3-bromoaniline) is treated with NaNOâ and HBFâ. The amino group is converted into a diazonium salt, forming 3-bromo-benzenediazonium chloride (product 4).

5. **Coupling with Anisole**: Product 4 is heated and treated with anisole (methoxybenzene). The diazonium group undergoes a coupling reaction with anisole. The methoxy group (-OMe) on anisole is a strong activating group and directs the coupling to occur at the para position relative to itself. This results in the formation of a biphenyl structure where the methoxy group is at position 4' and the bromine is at position 3 on the other ring.

The final product is **3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl**, which corresponds to option C.
