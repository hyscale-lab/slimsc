Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Astronomers found a system with five exoplanets using the TTV method. All have circular orbits and are in orbital resonance. Their orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. The question is about the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2, assuming they have the same albedo.

Hmm, equilibrium temperature. Right, so the formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_0 * sqrt(R/(2a)), where T_0 is the star's effective temperature, R is the star's radius, and a is the planet's orbital semi-major axis. But since all these planets are around the same star, R and T_0 would be the same for all. So the temperature ratio depends on the square root of the inverse of the semi-major axis ratio.

Wait, actually, I think the formula I remember is T_planet = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * (1 - albedo)^0.5. But in this problem, albedo is the same for all planets, so they cancel out. So the ratio of their temperatures will just depend on the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes.

Wait wait, but the orbital periods are given. How does that relate to the semi-major axis? Oh right, Kepler's third law. For planets around the same star, the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. So P² ∝ a³. So a ∝ P^(2/3).

So if I can find the ratio of their semi-major axes, then I can find the ratio of their temperatures.

The planets are Planet_1 to Planet_5, with period ratios 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So let's assign their periods as P1=1, P2=2, P3=2.5, P4=3.5, P5=5. But wait, the actual periods don't matter as much as their ratios because we can express a in terms of P.

So for Planet 2 and Planet 4, their periods are 2 and 3.5, respectively. So the ratio P4/P2 is 3.5/2 = 1.75.

Since a ∝ P^(2/3), the ratio a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3) = (1.75)^(2/3).

Wait, let me compute that. 1.75 is 7/4. So (7/4)^(2/3). Let's calculate that.

But wait, I'm looking for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. So T4 / T2 = sqrt( (a2) / (a4) ), because the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis. Because T ∝ 1/sqrt(a).

Wait, let me make sure I get this right. The formula is T = T0 * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ), so T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a). So T4 / T2 = sqrt( a2 / a4 ).

But a4/a2 is (P4/P2)^(2/3) → (3.5/2)^(2/3) = (1.75)^(2/3). So the reciprocal is (1.75)^(-2/3) = (2/3.5)^(2/3) = (2/(7/4))^(2/3) ?

Wait no, 3.5 is 7/2, so 3.5/2 is 7/4. So a4 = a1*(7/4)^(2/3), but a2 is a1*(2/1)^(2/3) because P2 is 2, P1 is 1. Wait wait, no, perhaps I should express a in terms of a1. Let me think.

Wait, the periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So P1 = 1 unit, P2 = 2, etc. So for each planet, a_i = (P_i)^(2/3) multiplied by a scaling factor (like a1). Because a is proportional to P^(2/3).

So a2 = (2)^(2/3) * a1, and a4 = (3.5)^(2/3) * a1.

So the ratio a4/a2 = (3.5/2)^(2/3) = (1.75)^(2/3).

So T4/T2 is sqrt( (a2)/(a4) ) = sqrt( (2/3.5)^(2/3) ) = (2/3.5)^(1/3).

Wait, because (a2/a4) is (2/3.5)^(2/3), sqrt of that is (2/3.5)^(1/3). Because sqrt(x) is x^(1/2), so (x)^(2/3) squared is (x)^(1/3). So sqrt( (2/3.5)^(2/3) ) = (2/3.5)^(1/3).

2/3.5 is 4/7, approximately 0.5714. So (4/7)^(1/3). Let's compute that.

Calculating 4/7, which is about 0.5714. The cube root of that.

I know that (0.5714)^(1/3) is approximately 0.83. Wait, but wait, the cube of 0.83 is about 0.571, because 0.8^3 is 0.512, and 0.83^3 is 0.83*0.83=0.6889, times 0.83 is approximately 0.571. So cube root of 0.571 is about 0.83? Wait wait, no.

Wait, 0.83 cubed is 0.83 * 0.83 = ~0.6889, then 0.6889 * 0.83 ≈ 0.571. So that's correct. So (4/7)^(1/3) ≈ 0.83, but wait, 4/7 is approximately 0.571. So the cube root is approximately 0.83. So T4 / T2 ≈ 0.83.

Wait, but I thought T4 was colder than T2 because it's farther out. So if T4 is 0.83 times T2, that would imply T4 is cooler, which would make sense if a4 is larger than a2.

Wait, let me double-check.

Because Planet_4 is at a larger semi-major axis than Planet_2. So Planet_4 should be colder. So T4 < T2. So if the ratio T4/T2 is 0.83, that's correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is ~0.83. So that would be the answer. But let me make sure I didn't mix up the ratio.

Wait, we have the ratio T4 / T2 = (2/3.5)^(1/3) = (4/7)^(1/3). Which is approximately 0.83.

But wait another thought: The equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis. Because T is proportional to (L/(16πσ a²))^(1/4) → wait, maybe I should re-derive the formula.

The equilibrium temperature formula is derived from the balance between the incoming stellar flux and the outgoing thermal radiation. The flux received is L/(4πa²), and the planet radiates as a blackbody: σT^4 = (L/(4πa²)) * (1 - albedo)/4.

So solving for T: T = [ (L (1 - A) )/(16 π σ a² ) ]^(1/4) → T ∝ (1/sqrt(a)).

So T4 / T2 = sqrt( (a2) / (a4) ) = sqrt( (P2^(2/3)) / (P4^(2/3)) ) = (P2/P4)^(1/3).

Because a is proportional to P^(2/3), so a2 = k * P2^(2/3), a4 = k * P4^(2/3). So a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3), and sqrt(a2/a4) is (P2/P4)^(1/3).

So yes, T4/T2 = (P2/P4)^(1/3) = (2/3.5)^(1/3) = (4/7)^(1/3).

Which is approximately cube root of 0.571, which is about 0.83. So the ratio is approximately 0.83.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.83.

So the answer should be C.

To determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we use the equilibrium temperature formula:

\[
T \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}}
\]

where \(a\) is the semi-major axis. From Kepler's third law, \(a \propto P^{2/3}\), so the ratio of semi-major axes depends on the cube root of the ratio of orbital periods. The orbital periods of Planet_2 and Planet_4 are in the ratio \(2:3.5\), so:

\[
\frac{a_4}{a_2} = \left(\frac{P_4}{P_2}\right)^{2/3} = \left(\frac{3.5}{2}\right)^{2/3} = (1.75)^{2/3}.
\]

The equilibrium temperature ratio is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis ratio:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_4}} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{2}{3.5}\right)^{2/3}} = \left(\frac{2}{3.5}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Simplifying \(\frac{2}{3.5}\) gives \(\frac{4}{7} \approx 0.571\). Taking the cube root of \(0.571\) yields approximately \(0.83\). Thus, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately \(0.83\).

The correct answer is:

So the ratio of their temperatures will just depend on the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes.

Wait wait, but the orbital periods are given. How does that relate to the semi-major axis? Oh right, Kepler's third law. For planets around the same star, the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. So P² ∝ a³. So a ∝ P^(2/3).

So for Planet 2 and Planet 4, their periods are 2 and 3.5, respectively. So the ratio P4/P2 is 3.5/2 = 1.75.

Since a ∝ P^(2/3), the ratio a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3) = (1.75)^(2/3).

Wait, let me compute that. 1.75 is 7/4. So (7/4)^(2/3). Let's calculate that.

But wait, I'm looking for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. So T4 / T2 = sqrt( (a2) / (a4) ), because the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis. Because T ∝ 1/sqrt(a).

Wait, let me make sure I get this right. The formula is T = T0 * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ), so T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a). So T4 / T2 = sqrt( a2 / a4 ).

But a4/a2 is (P4/P2)^(2/3) → (3.5/2)^(2/3) = (1.75)^(2/3). So the reciprocal is (1.75)^(-2/3) = (2/3.5)^(2/3) = (2/(7/4))^(2/3) ?

Wait no, 3.5 is 7/2, so 3.5/2 is 7/4. So a4 = a1*(7/4)^(2/3), but a2 is a1*(2/1)^(2/3) because P2 is 2, P1 is 1. Wait wait, no, perhaps I should express a in terms of a1. Let me think.

Wait, the periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So P1 = 1 unit, P2 = 2, etc. So for each planet, a_i = (P_i)^(2/3) multiplied by a scaling factor (like a1). Because a is proportional to P^(2/3).

So a2 = (2)^(2/3) * a1, and a4 = (3.5)^(2/3) * a1.

So the ratio a4/a2 = (3.5/2)^(2/3) = (1.75)^(2/3).

So T4/T2 is sqrt( (a2)/(a4) ) = sqrt( (2/3.5)^(2/3) ) = (2/3.5)^(1/3).

Wait, because (a2/a4) is (2/3.5)^(2/3), sqrt of that is (2/3.5)^(1/3). Because sqrt(x) is x^(1/2), so (x)^(2/3) squared is (x)^(1/3). So sqrt( (2/3.5)^(2/3) ) = (2/3.5)^(1/3).

2/3.5 is 4/7, approximately 0.5714. So (4/7)^(1/3). Let's compute that.

Calculating 4/7, which is about 0.5714. The cube root of that.

I know that (0.5714)^(1/3) is approximately 0.83. Wait, but wait, the cube of 0.83 is about 0.571, because 0.8^3 is 0.512, and 0.83^3 is 0.83*0.83=0.6889, times 0.83 is approximately 0.571. So cube root of 0.571 is about 0.83? Wait wait, no.

Wait, 0.83 cubed is 0.83 * 0.83 = ~0.6889, then 0.6889 * 0.83 ≈ 0.571. So that's correct. So (4/7)^(1/3) ≈ 0.83, but wait, 4/7 is approximately 0.571. So the cube root is approximately 0.83. So T4 / T2 ≈ 0.83.

Wait, but I thought T4 was colder than T2 because it's farther out. So if T4 is 0.83 times T2, that would imply T4 is cooler, which would make sense if a4 is larger than a2.

Wait, let me double-check.

Because Planet_4 is at a larger semi-major axis than Planet_2. So Planet_4 should be colder. So T4 < T2. So if the ratio T4/T2 is 0.83, that's correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is ~0.83. So that would be the answer. But let me make sure I didn't mix up the ratio.

Wait, we have the ratio T4 / T2 = (2/3.5)^(1/3) = (4/7)^(1/3). Which is approximately 0.83.

But wait another thought: The equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis. Because T is proportional to (L/(16πσ a²))^(1/4) → wait, maybe I should re-derive the formula.

The equilibrium temperature formula is derived from the balance between the incoming stellar flux and the outgoing thermal radiation. The flux received is L/(4πa²), and the planet radiates as a blackbody: σT^4 = (L/(4πa²)) * (1 - albedo)/4.

So solving for T: T = [ (L (1 - A) )/(16 π σ a² ) ]^(1/4) → T ∝ (1/sqrt(a)).

So T4 / T2 = sqrt( (a2) / (a4) ) = sqrt( (P2^(2/3)) / (P4^(2/3)) ) = (P2/P4)^(1/3).

Because a is proportional to P^(2/3), so a2 = k * P2^(2/3), a4 = k * P4^(2/3). So a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3), and sqrt(a2/a4) is (P2/P4)^(1/3).

So yes, T4/T2 = (P2/P4)^(1/3) = (2/3.5)^(1/3) = (4/7)^(1/3).

Which is approximately cube root of 0.571, which is about 0.83. So the ratio is approximately 0.83.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.83.

So the answer should be C.


To determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we use the equilibrium temperature formula:

\[
T \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}}
\]

where \(a\) is the semi-major axis. From Kepler's third law, \(a \propto P^{2/3}\), so the ratio of semi-major axes depends on the cube root of the ratio of orbital periods. The orbital periods of Planet_2 and Planet_4 are in the ratio \(2:3.5\), so:

\[
\frac{a_4}{a_2} = \left(\frac{P_4}{P_2}\right)^{2/3} = \left(\frac{3.5}{2}\right)^{2/3} = (1.75)^{2/3}.
\]

The equilibrium temperature ratio is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis ratio:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_4}} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{2}{3.5}\right)^{2/3}} = \left(\frac{2}{3.5}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Simplifying \(\frac{2}{3.5}\) gives \(\frac{4}{7} \approx 0.571\). Taking the cube root of \(0.571\) yields approximately \(0.83\). Thus, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately \(0.83\).
