Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this science problem. Let me read through it carefully and think it through step by step.

So, the question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells, and we're looking at their developmental fate. The setup involves some genetic constructs and experiments done in mice. 

First, some background: Ligands and receptors usually interact in a paracrine or autocrine manner. But the question is about why a green signal isn't observed in the offspring when visualized under a confocal microscope.

The construct is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two genes in one vector. The ligand's ORF (open reading frame) is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So, the vector has two ORFs: ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP.

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. CBA stands for chicken beta actin; it's a strong promoter used for overexpression. The receptor has an IRES regulatory element upstream. IRES is an internal ribosome entry site, which allows for the translation of a second ORF in a bicistronic mRNA. So the receptor expression would be dependent on the IRES, meaning the two proteins can be co-expressed from the same mRNA but under different promoters.

Now, looking at the stop cassettes: between ligand ORF and mCherry is a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, between receptor and eGFP is a stop in a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. LoxP and lox2272 are loxP variant sites used in recombination. So without Cre, the stop cassette blocks expression of the downstream gene. But when Cre is present, it recombines the lox sites, removing the stop cassette, so the downstream gene (mCherry or eGFP) is expressed.

Wait, but in this setup, the ligand is under CBA promoter, which presumably is driving the expression of both the ligand and the receptor. The IRES is after the receptor, so that would allow the receptor to be translated as well.

But the problem is about why the green signal (eGFP) isn't observed. So in the experiment, they crossed the mouse model (homozygous for the construct) with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice.

Hmm. SOX10 is a transcription factor involved in neural crest development. SOX10-Cre would drive Cre expression in neural crest cells, leading to recombination in those cells. So in the offspring, the Cre would recombine the lox sites, allowing expression of the downstream genes.

Wait, but the vector is a bicistronic construct with loxP and lox2272 stops. Let me think about the arrangement.

The vector is set up so that the ligand is upstream of the receptor. So the mRNA would have the ligand ORF under CBA, followed by the IRES, then the receptor ORF, and so on.

Wait, no. Wait, the vector is bicistronic, so it's probably ligand ORF under CBA promoter, followed by IRES, then receptor ORF under its own promoter? Or is the IRES part of the receptor's expression?

Wait, the question says the ligand is under CBA promoter, and upstream of the receptor is the IRES element. So perhaps the mRNA is ligand followed by IRES-receptor. So the CBA promoter would drive the transcription of a message that includes both ligand and receptor, with the IRES allowing translation of the receptor after the ligand.

But each has a stop cassette. So ligand is followed by a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, then mCherry. Receptor is followed by lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette, then eGFP.

Wait, so without Cre, the stop cassettes prevent expression of mCherry and eGFP. But with Cre, the loxP and lox2272 are different, so which would recombine? Because Cre recognizes loxP sites. So if the stop cassette for the ligand is loxP-stop-loxP, then Cre would remove it. Similarly, the receptor's stop is lox2272-stop-lox2272, which Cre can't recombine because Cre doesn't recognize lox2272. Wait, no, wait. LoxP and lox2272 are different lox variants. The Cre recombinase can only recognize loxP sites, and FLP recombinase recognizes lox2272. So in this setup, introducing Cre would only remove the loxP-stop-loxP cassette, allowing mCherry to be expressed. The receptor's stop cassette would remain because Cre can't recombine lox2272.

Wait, but wait: the vector is a bicistronic construct, so each gene (ligand and receptor) is in the same vector. The ligand is at 5' with its own promoter (CBA), followed by the IRES, then the receptor, which is under an IRES. So the CBA promoter would drive the expression of ligand, and the IRES would allow translation of the receptor.

But each gene has a stop cassette. So, ligand is followed by loxP-stop-loxP, then mCherry. Receptor is followed by lox2272-stop-lox2272, then eGFP.

In the absence of Cre, the ligand's stop cassette blocks mCherry, and receptor's stop blocks eGFP. But when Cre is introduced, it will recombine the loxP sites, removing the stop cassette for the ligand, allowing mCherry to be expressed. The receptor's stop is lox2272, which Cre can't recombine, so the receptor-eGFP remains blocked.

Wait, but that's not possible. Because the ligand and receptor are in the same vector. If the parent is homozygous for the construct, and the offspring's genotype includes the Cre, perhaps the Cre is expressed under the SOX10 promoter, which is active in neural crest cells.

Wait, so in the mouse model, the construct is in the genome. When they cross it with SOX10-Cre mice, the Cre is expressed in neural crest cells. So in those cells, the Cre would recombine the loxP sites, removing the stop cassette for the ligand, allowing mCherry to be expressed. The receptor's stop cassette is lox2272, which Cre can't recombine, so the receptor and eGFP would not be expressed.

But the question is about eGFP not being observed. The setup says they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins, but the eGFP isn't showing up. So perhaps the eGFP isn't being expressed.

Wait, but in the vector, the eGFP is after the receptor, and the stop cassette is lox2272. So Cre won't remove that stop, as it can't recognize lox2272. So the eGFP would not be expressed unless the stop is removed. So in the mouse, after Cre is introduced, only the ligand-mCherry would be expressed, because the loxP-stop is removed in the ligand's case. The receptor-eGFP would remain blocked because the lox2272 stop isn't removed.

So when they look for the green signal (eGFP), it's not there. That suggests that the eGFP isn't being expressed. But why?

Looking at the options:

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. That would imply a frameshift, leading to no eGFP. But the question says that the antibodies were raised against the overexpressed proteins. So if the eGFP wasn't expressed, then the receptor also isn't. But perhaps the vector is set up so that only when the stop is removed, the eGFP is expressed.

Wait, but the stop cassette is between receptor and eGFP. So without recombination, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But when they cross with Cre, the loxP sites are recombined (for the ligand's stop), but the lox2272 for the receptor's stop isn't. So the eGFP should still be blocked.

Wait, but maybe the IRES is not working correctly. Or perhaps the promoters are wrong.

Option C says the enhancer is missing. If the enhancer for the ligand and receptor is missing, they might not be expressed. But the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter. The receptor is under IRES, so maybe the promoter is from the same CBA? Or perhaps the IRES needs a certain enhancer. I'm not sure.

Option B says the receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. That would mean it's not transported to the cell surface, so eGFP wouldn't fluoresce. But the question says the problem is the eGFP isn't expressed at all, not its localization.

Option A says ligand and receptor are paracrine. Not sure how that affects the expression. The expression is about whether the eGFP is made, not the interaction.

Option D: receptor and eGFP not in frame. If the stop cassette is between receptor and eGFP, then without recombination, the mRNA would have the receptor and then a stop, preventing eGFP. But if the upstream open reading frame (receptor) is in frame with eGFP, perhaps a frameshift would cause a premature stop. Or maybe the vector fuses them incorrectly.

Wait, the vector is described as the ligand ORF at 5' fused to mCherry, and the receptor ORF at 3' fused to eGFP. So the ligand is at the beginning, followed by the stop in loxP, then mCherry; the receptor is after the IRES, followed by a stop in lox2272, then eGFP. So in the absence of Cre, the ligand is expressed, but the mCherry is blocked. The receptor is expressed, but eGFP is blocked.

When Cre is present, the loxP stop in the ligand's cassette is removed, so mCherry is expressed. The receptor's eGFP remains blocked because Cre can't cut lox2272.

But the problem is that the offspring didn't show green. So maybe the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed.

Wait, but the mouse is homozygous for the construct. So each allele has this bicistronic vector. When they cross with SOX10-Cre, the Cre is expressed, leading to recombination in neural crest cells. So in the offspring, the Cre would remove the ligand's stop, allowing mCherry to be expressed. But the receptor's stop remains, so eGFP isn't expressed.

So when they look for eGFP, they don't see it. So that's expected. But the question seems to suggest that the eGFP should be expressed, and they're wondering why it isn't.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup. Let me re-examine the vector.

The vector is a bicistronic construct. The ligand is at the 5' end, under the CBA promoter. The receptor is at the 3' end, after an IRES element. The ligand has a loxP-stop after its ORF, so mCherry is after that. The receptor has a lox2272-stop after its ORF, with eGFP after that.

So without Cre, the ligand's stop remains, so mCherry is not expressed. The receptor's stop remains, so eGFP isn't expressed. When Cre is introduced, the loxP stops are removed, so mCherry is expressed, but the lox2272 stops are unaffected, so eGFP remains blocked.

But in the mouse, the construct is homozygous, meaning both alleles have this. When they cross to SOX10-Cre, the Cre is expressed in neural crest cells, leading to recombination of the loxP sites. So in those cells, the ligand and mCherry would be expressed, but the receptor and eGFP would not.

So when they look for eGFP, it's not present. But the question is about why no green signal is observed.

Wait, but the question said that in the Western blot, they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. That would suggest that the proteins are being expressed, but perhaps not the GFP.

Wait, but no, because the stop cassettes block the expression unless Cre is present. So if the vector is correctly set up, mCherry and eGFP are only expressed when Cre is present. So in the offspring, which have Cre (from SOX10-Cre), mCherry should be expressed, but eGFP shouldn't. So why is eGFP not expressed?

Wait, but the question said that the mouse model is homozygous for the construct in the wt background. Then they cross it to SOX10-Cre mice. So the offspring would have the construct plus SOX10-Cre.

Wait, but in the offspring, the Cre would be active in the neural crest cells, leading to recombination of the loxP sites, allowing mCherry to be expressed. But the eGFP is still blocked because the lox2272 sites are unaffected.

Hmm, but the question is about why eGFP isn't visualized. That's expected, because eGFP should only be expressed if the lox2272 sites are recombined, which requires FLP recombinase, not Cre.

Wait, but perhaps the Cre is not working correctly, or not expressed in the right cells. Or maybe the setup is wrong.

Wait, the vector has ligand with loxP-stop, and receptor with lox2272-stop. So when Cre is present, it only removes the loxP stops, allowing mCherry to be expressed. The lox2272 stops are not affected, so eGFP remains blocked. So the eGFP shouldn't be expressed in this setup.

But the question is why the eGFP isn't observed. The options suggest possible reasons. Let me look at the options again.

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. So the ORF of the receptor is not in the same reading frame as eGFP. That would mean that when the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't correctly translated. Alternatively, maybe the way the vector is constructed, the eGFP is not in frame with the receptor.

But the question says the vector was designed with the receptor ORF at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. So perhaps the eGFP is C-terminally tagged. If the vector is correctly constructed, the receptor is in frame with eGFP.

Wait, but wait. The vector is a bicistronic construct where the ligand is first, then the receptor. The stop cassettes are after each. So when the loxP is removed, the mCherry is expressed. But the eGFP is only expressed if the lox2272 is removed, which requires FLP. So in this case, the eGFP shouldn't be expressed when only Cre is present.

But in the experiment, the eGFP isn't expressed, which is what we'd expect. So why is the question about why there's no green signal? Because the question says that the eGFP isn't observed. So perhaps the setup in the vector is incorrect, leading to eGFP not being expressed even when Cre is present.

But the vector is designed such that the eGFP would only be expressed if the lox2272 is removed, which isn't done by Cre. So unless there's a mistake, eGFP shouldn't be expressed.

Wait, perhaps the IRES is not working correctly. The IRES allows the receptor to be translated after the ligand. But if the IRES is not functional, the receptor might not be expressed at all.

But in the absence of Cre, the ligand is expressed (because the stop for mCherry is in the ligand's cassette, which is loxP). Wait, no, without Cre, the ligand's stop is present, so the ligand is expressed, but mCherry isn't. Similarly, without Cre, the receptor's stop is present, so eGFP isn't expressed.

But when Cre is present, the ligand's stop is removed, so mCherry is expressed. The receptor's stop remains, so eGFP isn't. So the eGFP shouldn't be expressed. So why is the question asking why it isn't observed?

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not being expressed because the vector setup is wrong. Maybe the eGFP is under a promoter that isn't active, or the frame is wrong.

Looking at the options again, which one would lead to the eGFP not being expressed.

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. That would mean that when the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't in frame, so it isn't expressed. But in this setup, the eGFP's expression is blocked by the stop cassette, which isn't removed. So perhaps D isn't the right reason.

Wait, maybe the vector is incorrectly constructed so that the IRES is not allowing the receptor to be expressed. Or the promoter isn't correct.

Another angle: the question says the ligand is a coiled-coil of two alpha helices. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein. Does that matter? Probably not for the construct expression.

Alternatively, the problem might be that in the vector, the eGFP is not being expressed because the stop is in between, and without recombination, the eGFP is not made. But in the case where Cre is present, the eGFP is still not expressed because the lox2272 isn't removed.

Wait, perhaps the vector was designed incorrectly. The loxP is for the ligand's stop, but the lox2272 is for the receptor's stop. So with Cre, the ligand's stop is removed, but the receptor's isn't. So the eGFP isn't expressed. That's the expected result, so the green signal isn't observed. The question is why.

But the options are about potential reasons for the eGFP not being expressed. So which option fits?

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. That would mean that after the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't in frame, so it's not expressed. But in this case, the stop is not removed, so it's blocked. So D isn't the reason.

Option C: the enhancer for ligand and receptor is missing. If the enhancer is missing, the CBA promoter might not drive expression. But the ligand would be under CBA, so perhaps the ligand isn't expressed. But in the Western blot, they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins, which I assume are the ligand and receptor. If the ligand isn't expressed, perhaps the blot would show no signal. But the question says that the blot uses actin as a loading control, so the blot works.

Wait, but the Western blot result isn't mentioned in the question. The problem is about the confocal not showing green. So perhaps the vector didn't express the eGFP because of a construction problem.

Wait, another angle: the vector is a bicistronic construct with the ligand and receptor in the same direction. The IRES allows for the receptor to be translated. But perhaps the IRES is not functional, so the receptor isn't expressed, leading to no eGFP.

But the question is about why the eGFP isn't expressed, not the receptor. So the issue is whether the eGFP is expressed.

Wait, in the vector, the eGFP is after the receptor ORF, with a stop cassette. So without the stop being removed (i.e., without FLP recombinase), the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But why isn't it expressed when Cre is introduced?

Wait, perhaps the vector setup is wrong. The loxP and lox2272 stops are in such a way that Cre doesn't remove the eGFP's stop. Or perhaps it's the other way around.

Wait, the vector has the ligand ORF (5') with loxP-stop, and the receptor (3') with lox2272-stop. So Cre, which recognizes loxP, would only remove the ligand's stop. The receptor's stop remains, so eGFP isn't expressed.

So in this setup, the eGFP shouldn't be expressed. So the reason why there's no green signal is because the eGFP isn't expressed due to the stop cassette not being removed.

But the question is, which option explains this. Let me look at the options again.

Option D: receptor and eGFP not in frame. But if the stop isn't removed, the eGFP isn't expressed regardless of frame. So D isn't the reason.

Other options:

Option B: receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. That would mean it's expressed but not at surface. But the eGFP wouldn't show in the confocal, but the Western blot would show the protein. But the question says the Western blot is done, but the problem is with the confocal.

Option C: enhancer missing. If the enhancer is missing, the CBA promoter might not function. But the ligand is under CBA. If the enhancer is missing, ligand might not be expressed. But the question is about eGFP, not ligand.

Option A: ligand and receptor paracrine. That would mean they act on other cells, but expression is still happening. If the receptors are expressed, eGFP would be expressed only if the stop is removed.

Hmm. Wait, the vector is bicistronic, and the stop cassettes are for each. So in the presence of Cre, the ligand is expressed with mCherry, but the receptor's eGFP is not expressed because the lox2272 stop remains. So the eGFP shouldn't be expressed.

So why is the eGFP not expressed? Because the stop isn't removed. So the problem is that the vector's eGFP stop isn't recombined.

But the question is, why isn't the eGFP expressed in the presence of Cre? Because Cre can't remove the lox2272 stop.

Which option reflects this?

Looking at the options, none directly state that. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, perhaps the vector has the ligand under CBA, then the IRES, then the receptor under another promoter, and the eGFP after a lox2272 stop. No, the question says the ligand is under CBA, and the receptor is under IRES. So the same mRNA is used for both.

Wait, perhaps the IRES is not working correctly, so the receptor isn't being translated. So the eGFP isn't expressed because the receptor isn't.

But the question is about the eGFP, not the receptor. If the receptor isn't expressed, then the eGFP wouldn't be either.

Wait, but the IRES is supposed to allow the receptor to be expressed after the ligand. If the IRES is faulty, then the receptor isn't expressed, so the eGFP isn't either.

But the Western blot uses antibodies against the overexpressed proteins (probably ligand and receptor). If the IRES is faulty, the blot would show only the ligand. But the question doesn't mention that.

I think I'm going in circles. Let me try to summarize.

The setup is that the vector has ligand and receptor. The stop cassettes prevent eGFP expression unless the lox2272 is recombined, which requires FLP, not Cre. So eGFP isn't expressed when Cre is present, leading to no green signal.

But the options don't directly state this. Looking at the options again.

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. If the vector was incorrectly constructed, the receptor might not be in frame with eGFP, so even if the stop is removed, eGFP isn't expressed. But in our case, the stop isn't removed, so this isn't the issue.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector is designed so that the IRES is after the receptor. Hmmm.

Wait, perhaps the vector is set up as:

Ligand ORF (under CBA) --> loxP-stop --> mCherry

IRES --> Receptor ORF --> lox2272-stop --> eGFP

Wait, but that's not how bicistronic vectors usually are set up. Typically, the two ORFs are in the same transcript, with IRES allowing the second to be translated. So it would be Ligand ORF followed by IRES and Receptor ORF, with possible stops between them.

Wait, perhaps the actual structure is that the ligand is in the first ORF, then a stop with loxP, then the IRES, then the receptor, then a stop with lox2272, then eGFP.

Wait, but that seems complicated. Alternatively, the vector could be:

CBA promoter -> Ligand ORF -> loxP stop -> mCherry

IRES -> Receptor ORF -> lox2272 stop -> eGFP

But I'm not sure about the exact arrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector is designed such that the ligand and receptor are in the same transcript, with the IRES allowing the receptor to be translated after the ligand. The ligand is followed by a stop with loxP, so mCherry is after that. The receptor is followed by a stop with lox2272, then eGFP.

So without Cre, the ligand is expressed (as the stop after it is loxP, which is not removed), but mCherry isn't. The receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't because the stop after it isn't removed.

With Cre, the ligand's stop is removed, so mCherry is expressed. The receptor's stop remains, so eGFP isn't.

So the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed. So the reason in the options would be that the eGFP's stop isn't removed, but none of the options state that.

Wait, the question is about the reason why the eGFP isn't observed. The options are possible reasons.

Looking at the options:

A) Paracrine relationship. If the ligand and receptor are paracrine, then they are secreted and act on other cells. But this doesn't directly affect their own expression.

B) Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. That would mean it's not at the cell surface, but the protein is expressed.

C) Enhancer missing. If the enhancer is missing, perhaps the CBA promoter isn't active, so ligand isn't expressed.

D) Receptor and eGFP not in frame. That would cause eGFP not to be expressed if the ORF is disrupted.

But in our setup, the eGFP's expression is blocked because the stop isn't removed. So none of the options directly address this.

Wait, unless the vector was designed incorrectly. Let me think: the loxP is in the ligand's cassette, and lox2272 in the receptor's. So when Cre is introduced, only the ligand's stop is removed. So the eGFP remains blocked.

But the question is why the eGFP isn't expressed. The correct explanation is that the stop isn't removed because Cre doesn't recognize lox2272. But that's not one of the options.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the vector was designed with the loxP in the receptor's stop. Wait, that's possible. If the vector had the ligand followed by lox2272-stop and mCherry, and the receptor followed by loxP-stop and eGFP, then Cre would remove the loxP stop in the receptor's case, allowing eGFP to be expressed.

But in that case, the eGFP would be expressed, which contradicts the observation.

So perhaps the vector was set up incorrectly, with the loxP and lox2272 in the wrong places. For example, the ligand's stop is lox2272, and the receptor's is loxP. Then, when Cre is introduced, the receptor's stop is removed, allowing eGFP to be expressed, but the ligand's stop remains, so mCherry isn't expressed.

But in the question, the eGFP isn't expressed. So perhaps the vector wasn't set up correctly, leading to the eGFP not being expressed.

But looking at the options, the only option that talks about the vector's setup is D, which is about the frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the Western blot was done and showed expression, but the confocal didn't. But the question says the Western blot uses actin as a loading control, so perhaps the blot is working.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not being expressed because the stop is in the wrong place. But I'm not making progress.

Wait, another way: the vector is a lox-Cre vector, meaning that Cre is used to excise certain regions. The loxP-stop in the ligand's cassette would be removed by Cre, allowing mCherry to be expressed. The lox2272-stop in the receptor's cassette would require FLP to remove. So with Cre, the eGFP isn't expressed.

But the question is why the eGFP isn't observed. So the reason is that the eGFP's stop isn't removed. But the options don't directly state this.

Looking back at the options, option D is about the frame. If the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, then even if the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't expressed correctly. But in this case, the stop isn't removed, so the eGFP isn't expressed regardless.

So perhaps the real issue is that the vector wasn't correctly designed, leading to the eGFP not being in frame. But without more info, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the eGFP is not being expressed because the receptor is not correctly expressed. But the question is about the eGFP.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about the options again.

The correct answer is likely D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. Because if they're not in frame, then even if the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't expressed.

But in our case, the stop isn't removed, so the eGFP isn't expressed for a different reason. So why would the eGFP not be expressed?

Wait, the vector was designed with the ligand ORF followed by a stop and mCherry, and the receptor ORF followed by a stop and eGFP. So when Cre is introduced, the ligand's stop is removed, allowing mCherry to be expressed. The receptor's stop remains, blocking eGFP.

So the eGFP isn't expressed, but the question is why.

I think the correct answer is D, but I'm not completely confident. Alternatively, maybe the enhancer is missing (option C), but why would that affect the eGFP and not the ligand?

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't working, so the receptor isn't expressed. But the eGFP is after the receptor's ORF, so if the receptor isn't expressed, the eGFP isn't either.

But the question is about the eGFP not being expressed, not the receptor.

Another thought: the stop cassettes may be causing the entire construct to be cut out. For example, the loxP sites may flank the entire construct, leading to recombination and deletion. But that's more about the overall construct.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP's stop is between the receptor and eGFP, and the vector's construction caused a frameshift, making the eGFP not in frame.

But without more info, I'm not sure.

Given the options, I think the most plausible answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame, leading to no eGFP expression.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector expressing a ligand and receptor pair. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, followed by a loxP-stop-loxP cassette and mCherry, while the receptor is under an IRES element, followed by a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette and eGFP. The mouse model is homozygous for this construct and crossed with SOX10-Cre mice, which express Cre in neural crest cells. Cre recombines loxP sites but not lox2272. The experiment observes no green signal (eGFP) under confocal microscopy. The task is to determine the most likely reason for this outcome.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Vector Design**:
   - The ligand is at the 5' end, under the CBA promoter, followed by a loxP-stop-loxP cassette and mCherry.
   - The receptor is at the 3' end, under an IRES element, followed by a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette and eGFP.
   - Without Cre, the stop cassettes block mCherry and eGFP expression.
   - With Cre, the loxP-stop in the ligand's cassette is removed, allowing mCherry expression, but the lox2272-stop in the receptor's cassette remains, blocking eGFP expression.

2. **Expected Outcome**:
   - In the offspring, Cre recombines the loxP sites, allowing mCherry expression, but the eGFP remains blocked due to the lox2272 stop cassette, which Cre cannot recombine.
   - The absence of a green signal (eGFP) is therefore expected based on the vector design.

3. **Option Analysis**:
   - **A) Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**: This describes their interaction but does not explain why eGFP is not expressed.  
   - **B) The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**: This would imply eGFP is expressed but not at the cell surface. However, the Western blot result (not detailed) would likely show eGFP protein if expressed, which is not mentioned.  
   - **C) The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**: The ligand is under the strong CBA promoter, so a missing enhancer is unlikely to affect its expression. This option does not directly explain the lack of eGFP expression.  
   - **D) The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame**: If the receptor and eGFP are not in the same reading frame, eGFP would not be expressed even if the stop cassette were removed. This aligns with the observation that eGFP is not expressed, suggesting a potential issue in the vector's construction.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The most plausible explanation is that the receptor and eGFP are not in the correct reading frame, preventing eGFP expression. This aligns with the observed lack of a green signal and the possibility of an error in vector construction.

ANSWER: D

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this science problem. Let me read through it carefully and think it through step by step.

So, the question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells, and we're looking at their developmental fate. The setup involves some genetic constructs and experiments done in mice. 

First, some background: Ligands and receptors usually interact in a paracrine or autocrine manner. But the question is about why a green signal isn't observed in the offspring when visualized under a confocal microscope.

The construct is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two genes in one vector. The ligand's ORF (open reading frame) is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So, the vector has two ORFs: ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP.

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. CBA stands for chicken beta actin; it's a strong promoter used for overexpression. The receptor has an IRES regulatory element upstream. IRES is an internal ribosome entry site, which allows for the translation of a second ORF in a bicistronic mRNA. So the receptor expression would be dependent on the IRES, meaning the two proteins can be co-expressed from the same mRNA but under different promoters.

Now, looking at the stop cassettes: between ligand ORF and mCherry is a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, between receptor and eGFP is a stop in a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. LoxP and lox2272 are loxP variant sites used in recombination. So without Cre, the stop cassette blocks expression of the downstream gene. But when Cre is present, it recombines the lox sites, removing the stop cassette, so the downstream gene (mCherry or eGFP) is expressed.

Wait, but in this setup, the ligand is under CBA promoter, which presumably is driving the expression of both the ligand and the receptor. The IRES is after the receptor, so that would allow the receptor to be translated as well.

But the problem is about why the green signal (eGFP) isn't observed. So in the experiment, they crossed the mouse model (homozygous for the construct) with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice.

Hmm. SOX10 is a transcription factor involved in neural crest development. SOX10-Cre would drive Cre expression in neural crest cells, leading to recombination in those cells. So in the offspring, the Cre would recombine the lox sites, allowing expression of the downstream genes.

Wait, but the vector is a bicistronic construct with loxP and lox2272 stops. Let me think about the arrangement.

The vector is set up so that the ligand is upstream of the receptor. So the mRNA would have the ligand ORF under CBA, followed by the IRES, then the receptor ORF, and so on.

Wait, no. Wait, the vector is bicistronic, so it's probably ligand ORF under CBA promoter, followed by IRES, then receptor ORF under its own promoter? Or is the IRES part of the receptor's expression?

Wait, the question says the ligand is under CBA promoter, and upstream of the receptor is the IRES element. So perhaps the mRNA is ligand followed by IRES-receptor. So the CBA promoter would drive the transcription of a message that includes both ligand and receptor, with the IRES allowing translation of the receptor after the ligand.

But each has a stop cassette. So ligand is followed by a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, then mCherry. Receptor is followed by lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette, then eGFP.

Wait, so without Cre, the stop cassettes prevent expression of mCherry and eGFP. But with Cre, the loxP and lox2272 are different, so which would recombine? Because Cre recognizes loxP sites. So if the stop cassette for the ligand is loxP-stop-loxP, then Cre would remove it. Similarly, the receptor's stop is lox2272-stop-lox2272, which Cre can't recombine because Cre doesn't recognize lox2272. Wait, no, wait. LoxP and lox2272 are different lox variants. The Cre recombinase can only recognize loxP sites, and FLP recombinase recognizes lox2272. So in this setup, introducing Cre would only remove the loxP-stop-loxP cassette, allowing mCherry to be expressed. The receptor's stop cassette would remain because Cre can't recombine lox2272.

Wait, but wait: the vector is a bicistronic construct, so each gene (ligand and receptor) is in the same vector. The ligand is at 5' with its own promoter (CBA), followed by the IRES, then the receptor, which is under an IRES. So the CBA promoter would drive the expression of ligand, and the IRES would allow translation of the receptor.

But each gene has a stop cassette. So, ligand is followed by loxP-stop-loxP, then mCherry. Receptor is followed by lox2272-stop-lox2272, then eGFP.

In the absence of Cre, the ligand's stop cassette blocks mCherry, and receptor's stop blocks eGFP. But when Cre is introduced, it will recombine the loxP sites, removing the stop cassette for the ligand, allowing mCherry to be expressed. The receptor's stop is lox2272, which Cre can't recombine, so the receptor-eGFP remains blocked.

Wait, but that's not possible. Because the ligand and receptor are in the same vector. If the parent is homozygous for the construct, and the offspring's genotype includes the Cre, perhaps the Cre is expressed under the SOX10 promoter, which is active in neural crest cells.

Wait, so in the mouse model, the construct is in the genome. When they cross it with SOX10-Cre mice, the Cre is expressed in neural crest cells. So in those cells, the Cre would recombine the loxP sites, removing the stop cassette for the ligand, allowing mCherry to be expressed. The receptor's stop cassette is lox2272, which Cre can't recombine, so the receptor and eGFP would not be expressed.

But the question is about eGFP not being observed. The setup says they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins, but the eGFP isn't showing up. So perhaps the eGFP isn't being expressed.

Wait, but in the vector, the eGFP is after the receptor, and the stop cassette is lox2272. So Cre won't remove that stop, as it can't recognize lox2272. So the eGFP would not be expressed unless the stop is removed. So in the mouse, after Cre is introduced, only the ligand-mCherry would be expressed, because the loxP-stop is removed in the ligand's case. The receptor-eGFP would remain blocked because the lox2272 stop isn't removed.

So when they look for the green signal (eGFP), it's not there. That suggests that the eGFP isn't being expressed. But why?

Looking at the options:

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. That would imply a frameshift, leading to no eGFP. But the question says that the antibodies were raised against the overexpressed proteins. So if the eGFP wasn't expressed, then the receptor also isn't. But perhaps the vector is set up so that only when the stop is removed, the eGFP is expressed.

Wait, but the stop cassette is between receptor and eGFP. So without recombination, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But when they cross with Cre, the loxP sites are recombined (for the ligand's stop), but the lox2272 for the receptor's stop isn't. So the eGFP should still be blocked.

Wait, but maybe the IRES is not working correctly. Or perhaps the promoters are wrong.

Option C says the enhancer is missing. If the enhancer for the ligand and receptor is missing, they might not be expressed. But the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter. The receptor is under IRES, so maybe the promoter is from the same CBA? Or perhaps the IRES needs a certain enhancer. I'm not sure.

Option B says the receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. That would mean it's not transported to the cell surface, so eGFP wouldn't fluoresce. But the question says the problem is the eGFP isn't expressed at all, not its localization.

Option A says ligand and receptor are paracrine. Not sure how that affects the expression. The expression is about whether the eGFP is made, not the interaction.

Option D: receptor and eGFP not in frame. If the stop cassette is between receptor and eGFP, then without recombination, the mRNA would have the receptor and then a stop, preventing eGFP. But if the upstream open reading frame (receptor) is in frame with eGFP, perhaps a frameshift would cause a premature stop. Or maybe the vector fuses them incorrectly.

Wait, the vector is described as the ligand ORF at 5' fused to mCherry, and the receptor ORF at 3' fused to eGFP. So the ligand is at the beginning, followed by the stop in loxP, then mCherry; the receptor is after the IRES, followed by a stop in lox2272, then eGFP. So in the absence of Cre, the ligand is expressed, but the mCherry is blocked. The receptor is expressed, but eGFP is blocked.

When Cre is present, the loxP stop in the ligand's cassette is removed, so mCherry is expressed. The receptor's eGFP remains blocked because Cre can't cut lox2272.

But the problem is that the offspring didn't show green. So maybe the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed.

Wait, but the mouse is homozygous for the construct. So each allele has this bicistronic vector. When they cross with SOX10-Cre, the Cre is expressed, leading to recombination in neural crest cells. So in the offspring, the Cre would remove the ligand's stop, allowing mCherry to be expressed. But the receptor's stop remains, so eGFP isn't expressed.

So when they look for eGFP, they don't see it. So that's expected. But the question seems to suggest that the eGFP should be expressed, and they're wondering why it isn't.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup. Let me re-examine the vector.

The vector is a bicistronic construct. The ligand is at the 5' end, under the CBA promoter. The receptor is at the 3' end, after an IRES element. The ligand has a loxP-stop after its ORF, so mCherry is after that. The receptor has a lox2272-stop after its ORF, with eGFP after that.

So without Cre, the ligand's stop remains, so mCherry is not expressed. The receptor's stop remains, so eGFP isn't expressed. When Cre is introduced, the loxP stops are removed, so mCherry is expressed, but the lox2272 stops are unaffected, so eGFP remains blocked.

But in the mouse, the construct is homozygous, meaning both alleles have this. When they cross to SOX10-Cre, the Cre is expressed in neural crest cells, leading to recombination of the loxP sites. So in those cells, the ligand and mCherry would be expressed, but the receptor and eGFP would not.

So when they look for eGFP, it's not present. But the question is about why no green signal is observed.

Wait, but the question said that in the Western blot, they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. That would suggest that the proteins are being expressed, but perhaps not the GFP.

Wait, but no, because the stop cassettes block the expression unless Cre is present. So if the vector is correctly set up, mCherry and eGFP are only expressed when Cre is present. So in the offspring, which have Cre (from SOX10-Cre), mCherry should be expressed, but eGFP shouldn't. So why is eGFP not expressed?

Wait, but the question said that the mouse model is homozygous for the construct in the wt background. Then they cross it to SOX10-Cre mice. So the offspring would have the construct plus SOX10-Cre.

Wait, but in the offspring, the Cre would be active in the neural crest cells, leading to recombination of the loxP sites, allowing mCherry to be expressed. But the eGFP is still blocked because the lox2272 sites are unaffected.

Hmm, but the question is about why eGFP isn't visualized. That's expected, because eGFP should only be expressed if the lox2272 sites are recombined, which requires FLP recombinase, not Cre.

Wait, but perhaps the Cre is not working correctly, or not expressed in the right cells. Or maybe the setup is wrong.

Wait, the vector has ligand with loxP-stop, and receptor with lox2272-stop. So when Cre is present, it only removes the loxP stops, allowing mCherry to be expressed. The lox2272 stops are not affected, so eGFP remains blocked. So the eGFP shouldn't be expressed in this setup.

But the question is why the eGFP isn't observed. The options suggest possible reasons. Let me look at the options again.

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. So the ORF of the receptor is not in the same reading frame as eGFP. That would mean that when the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't correctly translated. Alternatively, maybe the way the vector is constructed, the eGFP is not in frame with the receptor.

But the question says the vector was designed with the receptor ORF at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. So perhaps the eGFP is C-terminally tagged. If the vector is correctly constructed, the receptor is in frame with eGFP.

Wait, but wait. The vector is a bicistronic construct where the ligand is first, then the receptor. The stop cassettes are after each. So when the loxP is removed, the mCherry is expressed. But the eGFP is only expressed if the lox2272 is removed, which requires FLP. So in this case, the eGFP shouldn't be expressed when only Cre is present.

But in the experiment, the eGFP isn't expressed, which is what we'd expect. So why is the question about why there's no green signal? Because the question says that the eGFP isn't observed. So perhaps the setup in the vector is incorrect, leading to eGFP not being expressed even when Cre is present.

But the vector is designed such that the eGFP would only be expressed if the lox2272 is removed, which isn't done by Cre. So unless there's a mistake, eGFP shouldn't be expressed.

Wait, perhaps the IRES is not working correctly. The IRES allows the receptor to be translated after the ligand. But if the IRES is not functional, the receptor might not be expressed at all.

But in the absence of Cre, the ligand is expressed (because the stop for mCherry is in the ligand's cassette, which is loxP). Wait, no, without Cre, the ligand's stop is present, so the ligand is expressed, but mCherry isn't. Similarly, without Cre, the receptor's stop is present, so eGFP isn't expressed.

But when Cre is present, the ligand's stop is removed, so mCherry is expressed. The receptor's stop remains, so eGFP isn't. So the eGFP shouldn't be expressed. So why is the question asking why it isn't observed?

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not being expressed because the vector setup is wrong. Maybe the eGFP is under a promoter that isn't active, or the frame is wrong.

Looking at the options again, which one would lead to the eGFP not being expressed.

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. That would mean that when the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't in frame, so it isn't expressed. But in this setup, the eGFP's expression is blocked by the stop cassette, which isn't removed. So perhaps D isn't the right reason.

Wait, maybe the vector is incorrectly constructed so that the IRES is not allowing the receptor to be expressed. Or the promoter isn't correct.

Another angle: the question says the ligand is a coiled-coil of two alpha helices. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein. Does that matter? Probably not for the construct expression.

Alternatively, the problem might be that in the vector, the eGFP is not being expressed because the stop is in between, and without recombination, the eGFP is not made. But in the case where Cre is present, the eGFP is still not expressed because the lox2272 isn't removed.

Wait, perhaps the vector was designed incorrectly. The loxP is for the ligand's stop, but the lox2272 is for the receptor's stop. So with Cre, the ligand's stop is removed, but the receptor's isn't. So the eGFP isn't expressed. That's the expected result, so the green signal isn't observed. The question is why.

But the options are about potential reasons for the eGFP not being expressed. So which option fits?

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. That would mean that after the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't in frame, so it's not expressed. But in this case, the stop is not removed, so it's blocked. So D isn't the reason.

Option C: the enhancer for ligand and receptor is missing. If the enhancer is missing, the CBA promoter might not drive expression. But the ligand would be under CBA, so perhaps the ligand isn't expressed. But in the Western blot, they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins, which I assume are the ligand and receptor. If the ligand isn't expressed, perhaps the blot would show no signal. But the question says that the blot uses actin as a loading control, so the blot works.

Wait, but the Western blot result isn't mentioned in the question. The problem is about the confocal not showing green. So perhaps the vector didn't express the eGFP because of a construction problem.

Wait, another angle: the vector is a bicistronic construct with the ligand and receptor in the same direction. The IRES allows for the receptor to be translated. But perhaps the IRES is not functional, so the receptor isn't expressed, leading to no eGFP.

But the question is about why the eGFP isn't expressed, not the receptor. So the issue is whether the eGFP is expressed.

Wait, in the vector, the eGFP is after the receptor ORF, with a stop cassette. So without the stop being removed (i.e., without FLP recombinase), the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But why isn't it expressed when Cre is introduced?

Wait, perhaps the vector setup is wrong. The loxP and lox2272 stops are in such a way that Cre doesn't remove the eGFP's stop. Or perhaps it's the other way around.

Wait, the vector has the ligand ORF (5') with loxP-stop, and the receptor (3') with lox2272-stop. So Cre, which recognizes loxP, would only remove the ligand's stop. The receptor's stop remains, so eGFP isn't expressed.

So in this setup, the eGFP shouldn't be expressed. So the reason why there's no green signal is because the eGFP isn't expressed due to the stop cassette not being removed.

But the question is, which option explains this. Let me look at the options again.

Option D: receptor and eGFP not in frame. But if the stop isn't removed, the eGFP isn't expressed regardless of frame. So D isn't the reason.

Other options:

Option B: receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. That would mean it's expressed but not at surface. But the eGFP wouldn't show in the confocal, but the Western blot would show the protein. But the question says the Western blot is done, but the problem is with the confocal.

Option C: enhancer missing. If the enhancer is missing, the CBA promoter might not function. But the ligand is under CBA. If the enhancer is missing, ligand might not be expressed. But the question is about eGFP, not ligand.

Option A: ligand and receptor paracrine. That would mean they act on other cells, but expression is still happening. If the receptors are expressed, eGFP would be expressed only if the stop is removed.

Hmm. Wait, the vector is bicistronic, and the stop cassettes are for each. So in the presence of Cre, the ligand is expressed with mCherry, but the receptor's eGFP is not expressed because the lox2272 stop remains. So the eGFP shouldn't be expressed.

So why is the eGFP not expressed? Because the stop isn't removed. So the problem is that the vector's eGFP stop isn't recombined.

But the question is, why isn't the eGFP expressed in the presence of Cre? Because Cre can't remove the lox2272 stop.

Which option reflects this?

Looking at the options, none directly state that. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, perhaps the vector has the ligand under CBA, then the IRES, then the receptor under another promoter, and the eGFP after a lox2272 stop. No, the question says the ligand is under CBA, and the receptor is under IRES. So the same mRNA is used for both.

Wait, perhaps the IRES is not working correctly, so the receptor isn't being translated. So the eGFP isn't expressed because the receptor isn't.

But the question is about the eGFP, not the receptor. If the receptor isn't expressed, then the eGFP wouldn't be either.

Wait, but the IRES is supposed to allow the receptor to be expressed after the ligand. If the IRES is faulty, then the receptor isn't expressed, so the eGFP isn't either.

But the Western blot uses antibodies against the overexpressed proteins (probably ligand and receptor). If the IRES is faulty, the blot would show only the ligand. But the question doesn't mention that.

I think I'm going in circles. Let me try to summarize.

The setup is that the vector has ligand and receptor. The stop cassettes prevent eGFP expression unless the lox2272 is recombined, which requires FLP, not Cre. So eGFP isn't expressed when Cre is present, leading to no green signal.

But the options don't directly state this. Looking at the options again.

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. If the vector was incorrectly constructed, the receptor might not be in frame with eGFP, so even if the stop is removed, eGFP isn't expressed. But in our case, the stop isn't removed, so this isn't the issue.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector is designed so that the IRES is after the receptor. Hmmm.

Wait, perhaps the vector is set up as:

Ligand ORF (under CBA) --> loxP-stop --> mCherry

IRES --> Receptor ORF --> lox2272-stop --> eGFP

Wait, but that's not how bicistronic vectors usually are set up. Typically, the two ORFs are in the same transcript, with IRES allowing the second to be translated. So it would be Ligand ORF followed by IRES and Receptor ORF, with possible stops between them.

Wait, perhaps the actual structure is that the ligand is in the first ORF, then a stop with loxP, then the IRES, then the receptor, then a stop with lox2272, then eGFP.

Wait, but that seems complicated. Alternatively, the vector could be:

CBA promoter -> Ligand ORF -> loxP stop -> mCherry

IRES -> Receptor ORF -> lox2272 stop -> eGFP

But I'm not sure about the exact arrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector is designed such that the ligand and receptor are in the same transcript, with the IRES allowing the receptor to be translated after the ligand. The ligand is followed by a stop with loxP, so mCherry is after that. The receptor is followed by a stop with lox2272, then eGFP.

So without Cre, the ligand is expressed (as the stop after it is loxP, which is not removed), but mCherry isn't. The receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't because the stop after it isn't removed.

With Cre, the ligand's stop is removed, so mCherry is expressed. The receptor's stop remains, so eGFP isn't.

So the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed. So the reason in the options would be that the eGFP's stop isn't removed, but none of the options state that.

Wait, the question is about the reason why the eGFP isn't observed. The options are possible reasons.

Looking at the options:

A) Paracrine relationship. If the ligand and receptor are paracrine, then they are secreted and act on other cells. But this doesn't directly affect their own expression.

B) Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. That would mean it's not at the cell surface, but the protein is expressed.

C) Enhancer missing. If the enhancer is missing, perhaps the CBA promoter isn't active, so ligand isn't expressed.

D) Receptor and eGFP not in frame. That would cause eGFP not to be expressed if the ORF is disrupted.

But in our setup, the eGFP's expression is blocked because the stop isn't removed. So none of the options directly address this.

Wait, unless the vector was designed incorrectly. Let me think: the loxP is in the ligand's cassette, and lox2272 in the receptor's. So when Cre is introduced, only the ligand's stop is removed. So the eGFP remains blocked.

But the question is why the eGFP isn't expressed. The correct explanation is that the stop isn't removed because Cre doesn't recognize lox2272. But that's not one of the options.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the vector was designed with the loxP in the receptor's stop. Wait, that's possible. If the vector had the ligand followed by lox2272-stop and mCherry, and the receptor followed by loxP-stop and eGFP, then Cre would remove the loxP stop in the receptor's case, allowing eGFP to be expressed.

But in that case, the eGFP would be expressed, which contradicts the observation.

So perhaps the vector was set up incorrectly, with the loxP and lox2272 in the wrong places. For example, the ligand's stop is lox2272, and the receptor's is loxP. Then, when Cre is introduced, the receptor's stop is removed, allowing eGFP to be expressed, but the ligand's stop remains, so mCherry isn't expressed.

But in the question, the eGFP isn't expressed. So perhaps the vector wasn't set up correctly, leading to the eGFP not being expressed.

But looking at the options, the only option that talks about the vector's setup is D, which is about the frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the Western blot was done and showed expression, but the confocal didn't. But the question says the Western blot uses actin as a loading control, so perhaps the blot is working.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not being expressed because the stop is in the wrong place. But I'm not making progress.

Wait, another way: the vector is a lox-Cre vector, meaning that Cre is used to excise certain regions. The loxP-stop in the ligand's cassette would be removed by Cre, allowing mCherry to be expressed. The lox2272-stop in the receptor's cassette would require FLP to remove. So with Cre, the eGFP isn't expressed.

But the question is why the eGFP isn't observed. So the reason is that the eGFP's stop isn't removed. But the options don't directly state this.

Looking back at the options, option D is about the frame. If the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, then even if the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't expressed correctly. But in this case, the stop isn't removed, so the eGFP isn't expressed regardless.

So perhaps the real issue is that the vector wasn't correctly designed, leading to the eGFP not being in frame. But without more info, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the eGFP is not being expressed because the receptor is not correctly expressed. But the question is about the eGFP.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about the options again.

The correct answer is likely D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. Because if they're not in frame, then even if the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't expressed.

But in our case, the stop isn't removed, so the eGFP isn't expressed for a different reason. So why would the eGFP not be expressed?

Wait, the vector was designed with the ligand ORF followed by a stop and mCherry, and the receptor ORF followed by a stop and eGFP. So when Cre is introduced, the ligand's stop is removed, allowing mCherry to be expressed. The receptor's stop remains, blocking eGFP.

So the eGFP isn't expressed, but the question is why.

I think the correct answer is D, but I'm not completely confident. Alternatively, maybe the enhancer is missing (option C), but why would that affect the eGFP and not the ligand?

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't working, so the receptor isn't expressed. But the eGFP is after the receptor's ORF, so if the receptor isn't expressed, the eGFP isn't either.

But the question is about the eGFP not being expressed, not the receptor.

Another thought: the stop cassettes may be causing the entire construct to be cut out. For example, the loxP sites may flank the entire construct, leading to recombination and deletion. But that's more about the overall construct.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP's stop is between the receptor and eGFP, and the vector's construction caused a frameshift, making the eGFP not in frame.

But without more info, I'm not sure.

Given the options, I think the most plausible answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame, leading to no eGFP expression.


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector expressing a ligand and receptor pair. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, followed by a loxP-stop-loxP cassette and mCherry, while the receptor is under an IRES element, followed by a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette and eGFP. The mouse model is homozygous for this construct and crossed with SOX10-Cre mice, which express Cre in neural crest cells. Cre recombines loxP sites but not lox2272. The experiment observes no green signal (eGFP) under confocal microscopy. The task is to determine the most likely reason for this outcome.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Vector Design**:
   - The ligand is at the 5' end, under the CBA promoter, followed by a loxP-stop-loxP cassette and mCherry.
   - The receptor is at the 3' end, under an IRES element, followed by a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette and eGFP.
   - Without Cre, the stop cassettes block mCherry and eGFP expression.
   - With Cre, the loxP-stop in the ligand's cassette is removed, allowing mCherry expression, but the lox2272-stop in the receptor's cassette remains, blocking eGFP expression.

2. **Expected Outcome**:
   - In the offspring, Cre recombines the loxP sites, allowing mCherry expression, but the eGFP remains blocked due to the lox2272 stop cassette, which Cre cannot recombine.
   - The absence of a green signal (eGFP) is therefore expected based on the vector design.

3. **Option Analysis**:
   - **A) Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**: This describes their interaction but does not explain why eGFP is not expressed.  
   - **B) The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**: This would imply eGFP is expressed but not at the cell surface. However, the Western blot result (not detailed) would likely show eGFP protein if expressed, which is not mentioned.  
   - **C) The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**: The ligand is under the strong CBA promoter, so a missing enhancer is unlikely to affect its expression. This option does not directly explain the lack of eGFP expression.  
   - **D) The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame**: If the receptor and eGFP are not in the same reading frame, eGFP would not be expressed even if the stop cassette were removed. This aligns with the observation that eGFP is not expressed, suggesting a potential issue in the vector's construction.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The most plausible explanation is that the receptor and eGFP are not in the correct reading frame, preventing eGFP expression. This aligns with the observed lack of a green signal and the possibility of an error in vector construction.

ANSWER: D
