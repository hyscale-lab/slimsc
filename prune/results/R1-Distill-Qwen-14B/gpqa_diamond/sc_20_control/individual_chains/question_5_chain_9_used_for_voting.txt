Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators correspond to observables, and eigenvectors represent the possible states with definite values.

Wait, the operator is given as a vector operator, I think. So, P is a vector operator with components P_x, P_y, P_z. Each component is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. The problem gives each component's matrix:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

The operator P is the vector operator, so I think it's in the form P = P_x x + P_y y + P_z z. But the direction n is arbitrary in the x-z plane. Oh wait, n is a direction vector in the x-z plane. So the operator along direction n would be P · n. Which is P_x n_x + P_z n_z, since n is in x-z plane, so n_y=0.

Wait, n is an arbitrary direction in x-z plane. So we can write it as n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ), perhaps, where θ is the angle from the z-axis. But I'm not sure, maybe it's written as (cosθ, 0, sinθ)? Wait, no. Wait, usually θ is the polar angle, so in spherical coordinates, θ is the angle from the z-axis, so x = sinθ cosφ, z = cosθ. But since n is in x-z plane, φ is zero, so n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So P·n would be P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ.

But the operator P·n would have eigenvalues corresponding to the eigenvalues of the operator. The eigenvalue given is +ħ/2. So we're looking for the eigenvector of (P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ) with eigenvalue ħ/2.

Wait, but each component of P is (ħ/2) multiplied by their respective matrices. So P_x is (ħ/2) times sigma_x, where sigma_x is the Pauli matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. Similarly for others.

So the operator P·n would be (ħ/2)[n_x sigma_x + n_z sigma_z]. Since n is in x-z plane, n_y=0, so it's just n_x sigma_x + n_z sigma_z multiplied by ħ/2. Let's denote the direction vector as n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ), so n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So the operator becomes (ħ/2) [ sinθ sigma_x + cosθ sigma_z ]

Now, the eigenvalue equation is [P·n] |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

So [sinθ sigma_x + cosθ sigma_z ] |v> = |v>

Because when we factor out (ħ/2), the eigenvalue is (ħ/2), so the equation becomes [ ... ] |v> = |v>.

Now, sigma_x and sigma_z are Pauli matrices. Let's write their matrices:

sigma_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]
sigma_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So the matrix for [sinθ sigma_x + cosθ sigma_z ] is:

sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]]
= [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

So the matrix is:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

We need to find the eigenvectors of this matrix corresponding to eigenvalue 1, because the eigenvalue equation is [matrix] |v> = |v> (since the (ħ/2) factor is already considered in the operator's definition).

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check. The operator is (ħ/2)(n_x sigma_x + n_z sigma_z). The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. So when we write the eigenvalue equation:

(ħ/2)( [n_x sigma_x + n_z sigma_z] ) |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

Dividing both sides by (ħ/2), we get [n_x sigma_x + n_z sigma_z] |v> = |v>.

So yes, the matrix is as I wrote, and the eigenvalue is 1.

So the eigenvalue equation is:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ] * [a, b]^T = [a, b]^T

Which leads to the equations:

cosθ a + sinθ b = a
sinθ a - cosθ b = b

Let me write these equations:

1. (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0
2. sinθ a + (-cosθ - 1) b = 0

Wait, that's two equations, but they might not be independent. Let me subtract equation 1 from equation 1? No, wait, perhaps I can solve for a and b.

Let me take equation 1: (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0 → equation (1)
Equation 2: sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0 → equation (2)

So from equation (1):

a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b

But let's compute (cosθ -1) = -2 sin^2(theta/2), because cosθ = 1 - 2 sin^2(theta/2). And sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2). So let's substitute:

a = [ - (2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)) ) / (-2 sin^2(theta/2)) ) ] b

Simplify numerator and denominator:

The numerator is -2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)
Denominator is -2 sin^2(theta/2)

So the negative signs cancel, and 2 cancels. So we have:

[ sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) / sin^2(theta/2) ) ] = cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) = cot(theta/2)

So a = [ cot(theta/2) ] b

So the ratio a/b is cot(theta/2). So a = b cot(theta/2)

So the eigenvector can be written as [a, b]^T = [cot(theta/2) b, b]^T = b [cot(theta/2), 1]^T

So the eigenvector is proportional to [ cot(theta/2), 1 ].

But wait, let's think about theta. Since the direction n is in the x-z plane, theta is the angle from the z-axis, right? So theta is between 0 and pi.

But wait, if theta is 0, then n is along z. Then we have to make sure that in that case, the eigenvector is along z.

Wait, perhaps more importantly, let's find the normalized vector.

So [a, b] = [ cot(theta/2), 1 ] multiplied by some scalar.

The normalization condition is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.

But since the operator is real (except for the P_y component which has imaginary terms, but when considering that P·n for n in x-z plane doesn't involve P_y, so the matrix is real and symmetric?), wait, not necessarily symmetric. Wait, in this case, the matrix generated was:

[ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

Which is a real symmetric matrix, so its eigenvectors are real. So the eigenvectors are real.

Wait, but wait, in our case, the operator is P·n, which for n in x-z plane, the operator is real. So the eigenvectors should be real.

So the eigenvector would be a real vector, so a and b are real.

So the normalized eigenvector is [ a, b ] where a = cot(theta/2), b=1. But let's compute the normalization.

Compute a^2 + b^2 = cot^2(theta/2) + 1 = csc^2(theta/2) = 1 / sin^2(theta/2)

So the normalization factor is sqrt( a^2 + b^2 ) = 1 / |sin(theta/2)|.

Since theta is between 0 and pi, sin(theta/2) is positive, so we can write 1 / sin(theta/2).

So the normalized vector is [ a, b ] = [ cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, let's compute cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2):

cot(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)

So a = [ cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2) ] * sin(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)

Similarly, b = sin(theta/2)

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, that's interesting. So the eigenvector components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2).

But looking at the options, option C is ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ). Option D is ( sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2) ). Wait, but in our calculation, the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but the options given have in option C just (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but with additional factors in option D. Wait, but the problem statement says the eigenvector is normalized. Our calculation gives that, so option C is the normalized one. But wait, looking back at the options:

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))

Yes, that's exactly what we have. But wait, the options have some with hbar multiplied, but in our case, the eigenvector is a dimensionless vector, so options A and D have hbar, which is not correct because eigenvectors are dimensionless. So options A and D have terms with ħ, which is Planck's constant, so that can't be correct because the eigenvector's elements are coefficients, not having units of ħ.

Wait, but wait, the definitions of P_x, P_y, P_z have factors of ħ/2. So the operator P·n is (ħ/2) times a matrix, and the eigenvalue is ħ/2. So the eigenvector is a unit vector in Hilbert space, so its components are dimensionless. So any option that includes ħ in the components is incorrect because it would have units of ħ, which is not appropriate for a vector in state space.

So options A and D have ħ multiplied, which can't be correct. So only options B and C are possible.

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), but that's for spherical coordinates, but in our case, the eigenvector is a two-component spinor, so it's (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is option C.

Wait, but wait, spin-1/2 particles have spin states described by two-component spinors. So for an eigenstate of S·n, the components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2) (with possible phase factors). So option C matches.

Alternatively, the eigenvector could be written as (e^{-i phi/2} cos(theta/2), e^{i phi/2} sin(theta/2)), but if phi is zero (since n is in x-z plane, phi=0), then it's (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

So the correct normalized eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is option C.

To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is defined in terms of its components:

- $P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$
- $P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}$
- $P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$

Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, it can be parameterized as $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle from the z-axis. The operator along $\vec{n}$ is given by $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = P_x \sin\theta + P_z \cos\theta$. Substituting the matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$, the operator becomes:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This leads to the system of equations:

1. $(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0$
2. $\sin\theta a + (-\cos\theta - 1)b = 0$.

From these equations, the ratio $a/b$ is found to be $\cot(\theta/2)$. Thus, the eigenvector can be written as:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = b \begin{bmatrix} \cot(\theta/2) \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To normalize the eigenvector, we impose the condition $|a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1$. Substituting $a = \cot(\theta/2) b$, we find:

\[
\cot^2(\theta/2) b^2 + b^2 = 1 \implies b^2 = \sin^2(\theta/2) \implies b = \sin(\theta/2).
\]

Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Now, analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Includes $\hbar$ in the components, which is incorrect because eigenvectors are dimensionless.
- **Option B**: Represents a general spherical coordinate form but does not match the derived eigenvector for a spin-1/2 system.
- **Option C**: Matches the derived normalized eigenvector $\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}$.
- **Option D**: Includes $\hbar$ and additional normalization factors, which are not consistent with the derived result.

The correct answer is **Option C**.

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators correspond to observables, and eigenvectors represent the possible states with definite values.

Wait, the operator is given as a vector operator, I think. So, P is a vector operator with components P_x, P_y, P_z. Each component is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. The problem gives each component's matrix:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

The operator P is the vector operator, so I think it's in the form P = P_x x + P_y y + P_z z. But the direction n is arbitrary in the x-z plane. Oh wait, n is a direction vector in the x-z plane. So the operator along direction n would be P · n. Which is P_x n_x + P_z n_z, since n is in x-z plane, so n_y=0.

Wait, n is an arbitrary direction in x-z plane. So we can write it as n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ), perhaps, where θ is the angle from the z-axis. But I'm not sure, maybe it's written as (cosθ, 0, sinθ)? Wait, no. Wait, usually θ is the polar angle, so in spherical coordinates, θ is the angle from the z-axis, so x = sinθ cosφ, z = cosθ. But since n is in x-z plane, φ is zero, so n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So P·n would be P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ.

But the operator P·n would have eigenvalues corresponding to the eigenvalues of the operator. The eigenvalue given is +ħ/2. So we're looking for the eigenvector of (P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ) with eigenvalue ħ/2.

Wait, but each component of P is (ħ/2) multiplied by their respective matrices. So P_x is (ħ/2) times sigma_x, where sigma_x is the Pauli matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. Similarly for others.

So the operator P·n would be (ħ/2)[n_x sigma_x + n_z sigma_z]. Since n is in x-z plane, n_y=0, so it's just n_x sigma_x + n_z sigma_z multiplied by ħ/2. Let's denote the direction vector as n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ), so n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So the operator becomes (ħ/2) [ sinθ sigma_x + cosθ sigma_z ]

Now, the eigenvalue equation is [P·n] |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

So [sinθ sigma_x + cosθ sigma_z ] |v> = |v>

Because when we factor out (ħ/2), the eigenvalue is (ħ/2), so the equation becomes [ ... ] |v> = |v>.

Now, sigma_x and sigma_z are Pauli matrices. Let's write their matrices:

sigma_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]
sigma_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So the matrix for [sinθ sigma_x + cosθ sigma_z ] is:

sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]]
= [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

So the matrix is:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

We need to find the eigenvectors of this matrix corresponding to eigenvalue 1, because the eigenvalue equation is [matrix] |v> = |v> (since the (ħ/2) factor is already considered in the operator's definition).

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check. The operator is (ħ/2)(n_x sigma_x + n_z sigma_z). The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. So when we write the eigenvalue equation:

(ħ/2)( [n_x sigma_x + n_z sigma_z] ) |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

Dividing both sides by (ħ/2), we get [n_x sigma_x + n_z sigma_z] |v> = |v>.

So yes, the matrix is as I wrote, and the eigenvalue is 1.

So the eigenvalue equation is:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ] * [a, b]^T = [a, b]^T

Which leads to the equations:

cosθ a + sinθ b = a
sinθ a - cosθ b = b

Let me write these equations:

1. (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0
2. sinθ a + (-cosθ - 1) b = 0

Wait, that's two equations, but they might not be independent. Let me subtract equation 1 from equation 1? No, wait, perhaps I can solve for a and b.

Let me take equation 1: (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0 → equation (1)
Equation 2: sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0 → equation (2)

So from equation (1):

a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b

But let's compute (cosθ -1) = -2 sin^2(theta/2), because cosθ = 1 - 2 sin^2(theta/2). And sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2). So let's substitute:

a = [ - (2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)) ) / (-2 sin^2(theta/2)) ) ] b

Simplify numerator and denominator:

The numerator is -2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)
Denominator is -2 sin^2(theta/2)

So the negative signs cancel, and 2 cancels. So we have:

[ sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) / sin^2(theta/2) ) ] = cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) = cot(theta/2)

So a = [ cot(theta/2) ] b

So the ratio a/b is cot(theta/2). So a = b cot(theta/2)

So the eigenvector can be written as [a, b]^T = [cot(theta/2) b, b]^T = b [cot(theta/2), 1]^T

So the eigenvector is proportional to [ cot(theta/2), 1 ].

But wait, let's think about theta. Since the direction n is in the x-z plane, theta is the angle from the z-axis, right? So theta is between 0 and pi.

But wait, if theta is 0, then n is along z. Then we have to make sure that in that case, the eigenvector is along z.

Wait, perhaps more importantly, let's find the normalized vector.

So [a, b] = [ cot(theta/2), 1 ] multiplied by some scalar.

The normalization condition is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.

But since the operator is real (except for the P_y component which has imaginary terms, but when considering that P·n for n in x-z plane doesn't involve P_y, so the matrix is real and symmetric?), wait, not necessarily symmetric. Wait, in this case, the matrix generated was:

[ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

Which is a real symmetric matrix, so its eigenvectors are real. So the eigenvectors are real.

Wait, but wait, in our case, the operator is P·n, which for n in x-z plane, the operator is real. So the eigenvectors should be real.

So the eigenvector would be a real vector, so a and b are real.

So the normalized eigenvector is [ a, b ] where a = cot(theta/2), b=1. But let's compute the normalization.

Compute a^2 + b^2 = cot^2(theta/2) + 1 = csc^2(theta/2) = 1 / sin^2(theta/2)

So the normalization factor is sqrt( a^2 + b^2 ) = 1 / |sin(theta/2)|.

Since theta is between 0 and pi, sin(theta/2) is positive, so we can write 1 / sin(theta/2).

So the normalized vector is [ a, b ] = [ cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, let's compute cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2):

cot(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)

So a = [ cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2) ] * sin(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)

Similarly, b = sin(theta/2)

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, that's interesting. So the eigenvector components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2).

But looking at the options, option C is ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ). Option D is ( sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2) ). Wait, but in our calculation, the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but the options given have in option C just (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but with additional factors in option D. Wait, but the problem statement says the eigenvector is normalized. Our calculation gives that, so option C is the normalized one. But wait, looking back at the options:

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))

Yes, that's exactly what we have. But wait, the options have some with hbar multiplied, but in our case, the eigenvector is a dimensionless vector, so options A and D have hbar, which is not correct because eigenvectors are dimensionless. So options A and D have terms with ħ, which is Planck's constant, so that can't be correct because the eigenvector's elements are coefficients, not having units of ħ.

Wait, but wait, the definitions of P_x, P_y, P_z have factors of ħ/2. So the operator P·n is (ħ/2) times a matrix, and the eigenvalue is ħ/2. So the eigenvector is a unit vector in Hilbert space, so its components are dimensionless. So any option that includes ħ in the components is incorrect because it would have units of ħ, which is not appropriate for a vector in state space.

So options A and D have ħ multiplied, which can't be correct. So only options B and C are possible.

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), but that's for spherical coordinates, but in our case, the eigenvector is a two-component spinor, so it's (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is option C.

Wait, but wait, spin-1/2 particles have spin states described by two-component spinors. So for an eigenstate of S·n, the components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2) (with possible phase factors). So option C matches.

Alternatively, the eigenvector could be written as (e^{-i phi/2} cos(theta/2), e^{i phi/2} sin(theta/2)), but if phi is zero (since n is in x-z plane, phi=0), then it's (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

So the correct normalized eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is option C.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is defined in terms of its components:

- $P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$
- $P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}$
- $P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$

Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, it can be parameterized as $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle from the z-axis. The operator along $\vec{n}$ is given by $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = P_x \sin\theta + P_z \cos\theta$. Substituting the matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$, the operator becomes:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This leads to the system of equations:

1. $(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0$
2. $\sin\theta a + (-\cos\theta - 1)b = 0$.

From these equations, the ratio $a/b$ is found to be $\cot(\theta/2)$. Thus, the eigenvector can be written as:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = b \begin{bmatrix} \cot(\theta/2) \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To normalize the eigenvector, we impose the condition $|a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1$. Substituting $a = \cot(\theta/2) b$, we find:

\[
\cot^2(\theta/2) b^2 + b^2 = 1 \implies b^2 = \sin^2(\theta/2) \implies b = \sin(\theta/2).
\]

Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Now, analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Includes $\hbar$ in the components, which is incorrect because eigenvectors are dimensionless.
- **Option B**: Represents a general spherical coordinate form but does not match the derived eigenvector for a spin-1/2 system.
- **Option C**: Matches the derived normalized eigenvector $\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}$.
- **Option D**: Includes $\hbar$ and additional normalization factors, which are not consistent with the derived result.

The correct answer is **Option C**.

Answer: C
