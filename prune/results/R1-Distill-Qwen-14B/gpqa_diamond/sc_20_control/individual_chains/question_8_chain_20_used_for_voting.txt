Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but let's try to work through it. So the question is about gene interactions in plants and their resistance to a fungal disease called anthracnose. 

So, from what I understand, the setup is that they've done a high-throughput experiment and found three candidate genes: G1, G2, G3. They created knock-out mutants for each, and also some double mutants. The goal is to figure out how these genes interact in terms of contributing to disease resistance.

The data given shows the resistance levels of each mutant compared to the wild type. Wild type is 100%, so higher is better resistance. So, looking at the data:

- g1 (G1 knockout): 75% resistance. So less than wild type but not super bad.
- g2: 0% — that's really bad. So the plant can't resist the fungus at all without G2.
- g3: 50% — so half the resistance of wild type.
- Double mutants:
  - g1g3: 10% — that's even worse than either g1 or g3.
  - g2g3: 0% — same as g2.
  - g1g2: 0% — same as g2.

Hmm, what's the pattern here? Let's think about what these results mean.

So, when a gene is knocked out and the plant's resistance goes down, that gene must contribute to resistance. If the resistance drops a lot, or even completely, that suggests the gene plays a key role.

Looking at g2: when G2 is knocked out alone, the resistance is 0%. That's a big effect. So perhaps G2 is a critical gene, maybe a transcription factor that activates other genes needed for resistance. Because if G2 is a transcription factor, then without it, none of the downstream genes would be expressed. So other genes that are part of the resistance pathway wouldn't be active, leading to no resistance.

Now, the double mutants: g1g3 has 10%. Both G1 and G3 are knocked out, but the resistance is even lower than either single knockout. Wait, but let's think: g1 alone is 75, g3 alone is 50. Why is the double mutant worse than both? That suggests that perhaps G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, but somehow their functions are additive. Or maybe when both are out, the plant can't do anything. Alternatively, this might not be the case.

Wait, but let's look at the other double mutants. For g2g3, it's 0% — same as g2. So when both G2 and G3 are knocked out, there's no change in resistance compared to just G2 alone. So that suggests that G3's function is redundant or perhaps downstream of G2. Because if G3's function is already inactive when G2 is knocked out, then knocking out G3 doesn't make it worse.

Similarly, g1g2 is 0%, which is the same as g2. So when G1 is knocked out along with G2, it's no better than just G2. So maybe G1 is downstream of G2, or perhaps G1's function is only contributing when G2 is present.

Wait, but g1 alone has 75% resistance. So without G1, the resistance is lower, but not gone. So perhaps G1 is part of a parallel pathway, or maybe it's a downstream gene. Let's think about the hierarchy.

Since g2 alone gives 0% resistance, which is a complete loss, it's possible that G2 is a transcription factor that activates other genes, including G1 and G3. So if G2 is a transcription factor, then without G2, the expression of G1 and G3 would be affected. But wait, in the data, G1 and G3 are knocked out individually, so their expression would be gone whether G2 is present or not. Hmm, but perhaps G2 is required for their activation.

Wait, but if G2 is a transcription factor upstream of G1 and G3, then knocking out G2 would also knock out the expression of G1 and G3. But in the data, G1 and G3 knockouts have some resistance. So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is upstream of a pathway, and G1 and G3 are downstream.

Wait, let's think about what the double mutants are showing.

In the case where G2 is knocked out (g2), the resistance is 0%. So the only way to get any resistance would be if other genes are contributing. But without G2, perhaps G1 and G3 can't function, or their function isn't enough.

Wait, but when G2 is knocked out along with G3 (g2g3), the resistance is still 0%, same as g2. So the presence of the G3 knockout doesn't make it any worse. So this suggests that G3's pathway is redundant or that it's not contributing when G2 is absent. Alternatively, G3's function is downstream of G2, so without G2, G3 can't contribute.

Hmm, but when G2 is present (as in wild type), G3 has a certain effect. Let's think about the single mutants: g3 has 50% resistance, which is better than g2 (0%) but worse than g1 (75%). So without G3, the plant's resistance is half. So perhaps G3 is part of a separate pathway that contributes to resistance.

Wait, but when both G1 and G3 are knocked out (g1g3), the resistance is 10%. That's worse than either single mutant. So maybe G1 and G3 are in separate pathways that both contribute to resistance. If both are out, then the plant has only 10% resistance. So each contributes a portion.

But when G2 is knocked out, the resistance is 0%, which is worse than either G1 or G3 knockout. So perhaps G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3. If G2 is a transcription factor, for example, it activates G1 and G3 expression. So without G2, G1 and G3 aren't expressed, leading to no resistance.

But wait, the single mutants g1 and g3 have some resistance. So in the wild type, G1 and G3 must be expressed even without G2? Or maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps G2 is required for their expression. Let's think.

If G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1 and G3, then in wild type, G2 is present, so G1 and G3 are expressed. But in the g2 mutant, G1 and G3 aren't expressed. So in that case, the single mutants (g1 and g3) would have some level of resistance because the other gene is still present.

But wait, when G2 is knocked out, the resistance is 0%, which is worse than either g1 or g3. That suggests that the presence of G2 is necessary for the plant's resistance, perhaps through activating other genes.

Wait, but how does that fit with the other results? Let's try to model this.

If G2 is a transcription factor, which activates G1 and G3, then in the wild type, all three are functional. So, in g2, G1 and G3 aren't expressed (or their expression is reduced). But the single mutants (g1 and g3) would have the other gene still active. So, for example, in g1, G3 is active because G2 is present. Similarly, in g3, G1 is active.

Wait, but in the data, g1's resistance is 75% of wild type. So without G1, the resistance drops from 100% to 75%. So G1 contributes 25% of the resistance. Similarly, g3 is 50% — so it contributes 50% of the resistance. Hmm, but that doesn't quite add up because when both are knocked out (g1g3), the resistance is 10%, which is much lower than either.

Wait, perhaps their contributions are additive. So G1 and G3 function in parallel pathways. So when G1 is out, the contribution from G1's pathway is gone. G3 is in another pathway. So if both are out, then 10% is the residual resistance from other pathways.

But then, what's the role of G2? Because in the g2 mutant, the resistance is 0%, which is worse than any other single mutant. So without G2, the plant can't resist anthracnose at all. So G2 must be upstream of both G1 and G3, perhaps activating them.

Wait, but if G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1 and G3, then in the g2 mutant, G1 and G3 aren't expressed. So the single mutants g1 and g3 would have some level of resistance because only one of G1 or G3 is knocked out, and the other is still active. But if both G1 and G3 are knocked out, then resistance would be even worse.

But in the data, g1g3 is 10% resistance. So without both G1 and G3, the plant's resistance is worse than either single. So that supports the idea that G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, and that their combined absence leads to worse resistance.

But wait, the wild type has 100% resistance. If G1 contributes 25% (as in, 25% of the resistance is from G1, and G3 contributes 50%), then without G2, perhaps neither G1 nor G3 are expressed, leading to 0% resistance. That would make sense.

So, if G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1 and G3, then without G2 (g2), both G1 and G3 are not expressed. So the plant can't rely on either, hence 0% resistance.

In the single mutants, g1 can't express G1 because it's knocked out, but G3 is expressed because G2 is active. Similarly, in g3, G1 is expressed (since G2 is active), but G3 is knocked out.

Wait, but in the data, g1 has 75% resistance. If G1 contributes 25%, then the plant can still get 75% from G3. Similarly, g3 has 50% — so maybe G3 contributes 50% and G1 contributes 25%, but perhaps there's another pathway contributing the remaining 25%.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 is part of a pathway that contributes 25%, G3 another that contributes 50%, and there's a third pathway contributing the remaining 25%. But without G2, all these pathways are disabled, leading to 0% resistance.

Wait, but if G2 is required for the expression of G1 and G3, then in the g1 mutant, G2 is present but G1 is knocked out. So G3 is expressed because G2 is active. So in that case, the resistance should be 50% (if G3 contributes 50% and G1 25%, but G1 is knocked out, so 50% resistance. But the data says g1 has 75% resistance. Hmm, that contradicts.

Wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Let me think differently.

Another approach: look for epistatic relationships. Epistasis occurs when the effect of one gene is dependent on the presence of one or more 'modifier genes'. If a gene A is epistatic to gene B, it means that the phenotype of gene B is only visible when gene A is present.

In the context of the problem, the resistance levels can indicate an epistatic relationship. 

Looking at the double mutants:

- g1g2: 0% resistance. Same as g2. So the presence of G1 mutation in the g2 background doesn't change the phenotype. So, perhaps G1 is downstream of G2. Because if G2 is knocked out, knocking out G1 doesn't make it worse. So G2 is epistatic to G1. Because G2's function is upstream, so whether G1 is present or not doesn't matter once G2 is gone.

Similarly, g2g3: 0% same as g2. So again, G3's knockout in the g2 background doesn't change resistance. So G2 is epistatic to G3 as well.

What about g1g3: 10% resistance. Both G1 and G3 are knocked out. The resistance is worse than either single mutant. So their effects are additive, perhaps.

So, putting this together:

G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. That suggests that G2 is upstream of both. So, if G2 is not functioning, then the functions of G1 and G3 don't matter because they can't contribute. 

So, G2 is a transcription factor upstream of G1 and G3. Without G2, G1 and G3 can't function, hence 0% resistance.

In the g1 mutant, G2 is present, so G3 can function. G3 contributes 50% of the resistance, so the g1 mutant has 75% (since G1 contributes 25% and G3 is fully functional). Wait, but 75% is higher than G3's 50% contribution. Hmm, maybe there's more to it.

Wait, maybe I should model it as:

- Wild type: G2 is active, so G1 and G3 are active. Their combined function leads to 100% resistance.

- g1: G1 is inactive, but G2 and G3 are active. So G3 contributes some resistance. But according to the data, g1 has 75% resistance. So perhaps G3 contributes 75% when active, and G1 is contributing 25% when active.

Wait no, because when G3 is knocked out (g3), the resistance is 50% — which would suggest that G3 contributes 50%. Because without G3, you're left with whatever G1 contributes, which is 75% - but wait, no, because in g1, resistance is 75%, which would imply that G3 contributes 25% and G1 contributes 75%? But then in g3, the resistance is 50%, which would mean that G1 contributes 50% when G3 is out. That doesn't quite add up.

Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, each contributing to resistance. So, G1 contributes 25% and G3 contributes 50%, adding up to 75%. But then, when both are out (g1g3), the resistance is 10%, perhaps from another pathway.

Wait, let's think of each gene's contribution as additive.

Wild type: 100% = G1 (25%) + G3 (50%) + other (25%).

So:

- g1: G1 is out, so 0 + 50 (G3) + 25 (other) = 75% — matches the data.
- g3: G3 is out, so 25 (G1) + 0 + 25 (other) = 50% — matches.
- g1g3: Both out, so 0 + 0 + 25 = 25%. But the data says 10% — doesn't match. Hmm, discrepancy here. So maybe there's another factor.

Alternatively, perhaps when both G1 and G3 are out, the other pathways aren't sufficient. Or maybe there's some interaction where their combined absence leads to a worse outcome.

Wait, but the other double mutants:

g1g2: 0% — same as g2.
g2g3: 0% — same as g2.

Which supports that G2 is upstream of both, so without G2, the other genes don't matter.

So, G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1 and G3. Without G2, G1 and G3 can't function, leading to 0% resistance.

In the single mutants:

g1: G2 is active, so G3 is active. So resistance is from G3 and any other factors. If G3 contributes 50%, but in the data, g1 is 75% — so maybe G1 contributes another 25%, or perhaps other factors.

Wait, perhaps G1 and G3 are both downstream of G2, but they function in separate pathways. So in g1, G3 is active, contributing 50%, and in g3, G1 is active, contributing 25%. But in the wild type, both G1 and G3 are active, so 50% +25% =75%, but the wild type is 100% — so that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps each gene contributes multiplicatively. So, the wild type has all three genes active, so 100% resistance. If any gene is knocked out, resistance is the product of the remaining genes' contributions.

But that's getting a bit complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates a set of genes, including G1 and G3. So, without G2, none of those downstream genes are expressed, leading to no resistance. 

In the single mutants:

g2 is 0% — no G2, so no resistance.
g1: G2 is present, so G2 is active, and so are other downstream genes, including G3. So the resistance is due to G3 and any other downstream genes. But according to the data, g1's resistance is 75%. So if G3 is active, perhaps it contributes 75% of the resistance, while G1 contributes the remaining 25% — but I'm not sure.

Wait, but in the g3 mutant, the resistance is 50%. So, without G3, but G2 is active and G1 is present, the plant has 50% resistance. So perhaps G1 contributes 50% when G3 is out.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let's try to approach it from the options given.

The options are:

A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Wait, but in the data, g2 is the most severe. If G1 were a transcription factor, then knocking it out would have a bigger effect. But in the data, g1 has 75% resistance, which is not as bad as g2's 0%. So maybe G1 isn't the transcription factor.

Option B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Hmm, I'm not sure what having the same promoter would mean. If G1 and G3 are co-promoted, perhaps they are co-expressed. But I'm not sure how that would affect the resistance levels. Also, G3 being epistatic towards G1 would mean that G3's function masks G1's effect. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Option C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy means that a single gene affects multiple traits. I'm not sure how that applies here. Plus, G1 being epistatic towards G3 would mean that G1's function masks G3's. But in the data, when both are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either, which suggests their functions are additive, not epistatic.

Option D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy means that the functions of G1 and G3 are overlapping, so knocking out both leads to a more severe phenotype. But in the data, when both are knocked out (g1g3), the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either alone. So that's consistent with redundancy. Also, if G1 is epistatic towards G3, then G1's function masks G3's. But I'm not sure how that fits with the data.

Wait, let me look again. The question states that at least one of the genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So likely, G2 is this transcription factor because its knockout is the most severe.

So, considering that:

If G2 is the transcription factor, then it must be upstream of G1 and G3.

In the g2 mutant, resistance is 0% — so G2 is essential for resistance.

In the g1 mutant, G2 is present, so G1 is knocked out but G3 is active. So the resistance is 75% — which is better than g2's 0%, but worse than wild type.

In the g3 mutant, G2 is present, so G3 is knocked out but G1 is active. Resistance is 50% — which is worse than g1's 75%.

So, when G2 is present, both G1 and G3 contribute to resistance. But if either is knocked out, the remaining gene contributes some resistance. When both are knocked out (g1g3), resistance drops to 10%, which is worse than either single. So that suggests that G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, contributing additively.

But when G2 is knocked out, neither G1 nor G3 can contribute, leading to 0% resistance.

So, the conclusion is that G2 is a transcription factor upstream of both G1 and G3.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A says G1 is a TF. No, because in the data, G2's knockout is the most severe.

Option B says G2 is a TF, which is correct. Then, G1 and G3 have same promoter. Not sure about that.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. Hmm, not sure.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. Gene redundancy would mean that if one is knocked out, the other can compensate. But in the data, knocking out either leads to some resistance reduction, but knocking both leads to more reduction. So that suggests redundancy, but their effects are additive, which is more like separate pathways.

Wait, but redundancy is when two genes have overlapping functions, so knocking out both leads to a more severe phenotype than either alone. That's what we're seeing with g1g3 having 10% compared to 75% and 50%. So that supports redundancy.

So, in this case, G1 and G3 are redundant. They each contribute to resistance, and when both are knocked out, the resistance drops more.

But wait, the question says that at least one is a TF. So we concluded G2 is the TF.

So in option D, "G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3."

Wait, but in the data, G1's knockout has higher resistance than G3's. So perhaps G1 contributes more than G3.

Wait, no, when G1 is knocked out, resistance is 75%, which is better than when G3 is knocked out (50%). So G3's knockout leads to worse resistance than G1's. That suggests that G3's function is more critical than G1's.

So if G1 is epistatic towards G3, that would mean that G1's function masks G3's. But in reality, G3's knockout has a worse effect than G1's. So perhaps G3 is epistatic towards G1? Or maybe the other way around.

Wait, epistasis is about the position in the pathway. If gene A is epistatic to gene B, it means that A is downstream of B. So the phenotype of B can only be seen if A is present.

But in our case, the double mutants are all worse than either single, which suggests that their functions are additive, not epistatic.

Hmm. Let me think again about each option.

Option A: G1 is a TF. But data contradicts that. So not this.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter (I'm not sure about this), and G3 is epistatic towards G1. So if G3 is epistatic, then G3's function would mask G1's. But in the data, when G3 is knocked out, the resistance is worse than when G1 is knocked out. So if G3 is epistatic, then perhaps in g1, the resistance should be same as wild type, which is not the case. So this might not fit.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. Pleiotropy is when a gene affects multiple traits, but I'm not sure how that applies here. Also, if G1 is epistatic, then in the g3 mutant, G1's presence would mask G3's effect. But in data, g3 resistance is 50%, which is worse than g1's 75%. So not clear.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, redundancy would mean that each gene contributes the same function, so knocking out both would have a more severe effect. So that fits with g1g3 being worse than either. But the question is, are their functions redundant or additive?

In additive, their effects are separate. So when both are out, the sum of their effects is subtracted. If they're redundant, same function, so their combined knockout is worse than either.

So, in the data, g1g3 is 10% — worse than either. So that's consistent with redundancy.

Now, G1 is epistatic towards G3. So, if G1 is epistatic, it would mean that G1's function is downstream of G3. But in the data, when G3 is knocked out (g3), the resistance is 50%, which is worse than when G1 is knocked out (75%). So in that case, G3's knockout has a bigger effect, suggesting that G3 is epistatic to G1.

Wait, because if G3 is epistatic, then without G3, you don't see the effect of G1.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of it in terms of pathways.

If G2 is a TF that activates both G1 and G3, then G1 and G3 are downstream of G2.

In the wild type, all three are functional.

In g1: G1 is knocked out, G2 and G3 are active. So the plant can rely on G3's function, leading to 75% resistance.

In g3: G3 is knocked out, G2 and G1 are active. So the plant relies on G1's function, leading to 50% resistance.

Wait, that would mean that G3 contributes more to resistance than G1. Because without G3, the resistance drops more.

In g1g3: both are knocked out, so resistance is 10% — perhaps because other pathways contribute a little, but without G2's activation, that's it.

So, in this model:

- G2 is the TF, upstream of both G1 and G3.
- G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, each contributing to resistance, but G3 contributes more.
- When both are knocked out, the remaining resistance is minimal.

So, looking at the options, which one fits this?

Option D says: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but G1 and G3 don't show redundancy because knocking out each leads to different resistances. Instead, their functions are additive.

So, perhaps the correct model is that G1 and G3 are in separate (non-redundant) pathways, both activated by G2. So in that case, neither is redundant, but their functions add. So when both are knocked out, the effect is additive.

Looking back at the options, none of them directly state that G1 and G3 are additive.

Wait, perhaps I should look again. The options are:

A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

B) G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

C) G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

D) G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Hmm. So from the data, G2 is the TF.

So, cross options:

Options B, C, D have G2 as TF. 

So the options would be B, C, or D.

Now, looking at the other parts.

Option B says G1 and G3 have the same promoter. I'm not sure what that implies.

Option C says G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits. But in this case, G1 and G3 each affect the same trait (resistance) but in different ways. So perhaps they are not pleiotropic.

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. That would mean that they have the same function, so knocking both out would lead to a worse phenotype. Which seems to fit with the data.

But in the data, G1 and G3 are in different pathways. So perhaps the redundancy is in their functions. So, G1 and G3 are redundant in their functions, meaning each can contribute to the same aspect of resistance.

In that case, the data shows that when both are knocked out, the resistance is much lower. So redundancy fits, but how about the epistatic part?

Option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. So G1's function is downstream of G3. But in the data, when G3 is knocked out, the resistance is 50%, which is worse than when G1 is knocked out (75%). So perhaps G3's function is more critical, which would suggest that G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Wait, but in the case where G3 is epistatic towards G1, that would mean that without G3, G1's function doesn't matter. But in the data, when G3 is knocked out, G1 is still present. So perhaps the model is that G3 is epistatic to G1.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on this. Another approach: the presence of epistasis is when the phenotype of a mutation in one gene masks the effect of another gene.

In the case of g1g3, the resistance is worse than either, so their effects are additive, not epistatic. So perhaps neither is epistatic.

But the options suggest that in the correct answer, one is epistatic.

Looking back, the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 have the same resistance as g2, which is 0%. That suggests that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. Because in the absence of G2, the functions of G1 and G3 don't matter.

So G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. So the epistatic relationships are:

G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

But none of the options mention G2 being epistatic. Let me check the options again.

Option A: G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Option B: G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Option C: G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Option D: G1 is epistatic towards G3.

So the correct epistatic relationship is that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

But none of the options explicitly state that. So perhaps the closest is option A, but G2 isn't the TF in option A.

Wait, no, option A says G1 is TF, which doesn't fit.

So perhaps the correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are downstream and additive.

But the options don't state that, so perhaps I have to choose the best fit.

Looking at the options, option D says G1 and G3 are redundant, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But in the data, G3's knockout is worse than G1's, which would suggest that G3 is more important, so perhaps G3 is epistatic.

Wait, but if G3 is epistatic, then in the g1 mutant, the resistance would be same as wild type, because G3 is present. But in the data, g1 has 75% resistance, which is not 100% as wild type.

So that doesn't fit. So perhaps option B is incorrect.

Hmm. Let me think about the possible hierarchy.

If G2 is a TF that activates G1 and G3, then G2 is at the top. G1 and G3 are in separate pathways.

In the wild type, all three are active, leading to 100% resistance.

In g1: G2 and G3 are active, so resistance is due to G3 and any other factors. So 75% suggests that G3 contributes 75% of the resistance.

In g3: G2 and G1 are active, so G1 contributes 50% of the resistance.

Wait, but that's inconsistent. Why would G3 contribute more than G1?

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is necessary for the expression of both G1 and G3.

In the wild type, all are on, so resistance is 100%.

In g1: G2 is on, so G3 is active. So resistance is determined by G3 — which is 75%.

In g3: G2 is on, so G1 is active. Resistance is determined by G1 — 50%.

In g1g3: both G1 and G3 are off. So resistance is 0% if no other pathways, but the data says 10%. Hmm, perhaps 10% comes from another pathway.

In the double mutants with G2 knocked out (g1g2 and g2g3), resistance is 0%, same as g2.

So, putting this together, G2 is the TF activating G1 and G3. G1 and G3 are in separate pathways contributing 50% and 75% respectively. When both are knocked out, perhaps the remaining resistance is only 10% from another pathway. So the data supports this.

Now, looking back at the options, which option aligns with this conclusion?

Option D says G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But my model suggests that G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, not redundant. So perhaps none of the options perfectly fit, but we have to choose the best one.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is B: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

But I'm not sure about the same promoter part.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct conclusion is that G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are downstream, with G3 being more critical.

But looking at the options again:

Option B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Hmm, same promoter would mean they are co-regulated. So, if G2 is the TF, perhaps it activates both, which is what we thought.

If G3 is epistatic towards G1, then when G3 is knocked out, the resistance would be determined by G1's function. But in the data, when G3 is knocked out, the resistance is 50%, which is worse than G1's knockout (75%). So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps epistasis in this context refers to the position in the pathway. If G3 is downstream of G1, then G3's function could be epistatic.

But I'm getting stuck. I think the best fit is option D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but I thought redundancy would mean that knocking out both leads to a worse phenotype, which is the case here (g1g3 is 10%). So D seems to fit that part.

Moreover, if G1 is epistatic towards G3, then G1's function is downstream of G3. So, in g3, the resistance is determined by G1's function.

In the data, when G3 is knocked out, resistance is 50% (g3), which is worse than when G1 is knocked out (75%). So that suggests that G3's function is more critical. So perhaps G3 is epistatic to G1, making option B or C more likely.

But in option B, G3 is epistatic towards G1. So in g1, the resistance would be same as wild type, but in the data, g1 is 75%, which is less than wild type. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm.

Another approach: Since g1g3 is worse than either, their functions are additive. So they are not redundant, but contribute different parts. So perhaps the correct option is not D.

But all the options with G2 as TF are B, C, D.

Option C: G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. I don't think that's the case.

So perhaps the correct answer is option A, but no, because G2 is the TF.

Wait, perhaps the best fit is option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy.

In that case, G1 and G3 are redundant, meaning they have the same function. So when both are knocked out, resistance is worse.

But in the data, in g1, the resistance is 75%, and in g3 it is 50%. So if they were redundant, knocking out either would have similar effects. But this isn't the case. So redundancy doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Same promoter would mean that G1 and G3 are co-regulated by G2.

If G3 is epistatic towards G1, then in the g1 mutant, the resistance would be same as wild type, but in the data, it's 75% — so that doesn't fit.

I'm getting stuck. Perhaps I should go back to what each option implies.

The question is about which conclusion can be drawn from the experiment.

Key points from the data:

- G2 knockout is lethal for resistance.
- G1 and G3 knockouts have partial resistance.
- Double knockouts with G2 are as bad as G2 alone.
- G1 and G3 double knockout is worse than either alone.

So, G2 is epistatic over G1 and G3, meaning it's upstream. So G2 is the TF.

G1 and G3 are in separate pathways contributing to resistance. Their combined knockout leads to additive reduction in resistance.

Looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is TF. No, because G2's knockout is worse.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter. So same regulation. So G2 activates both. But the data doesn't suggest that they are in the same pathway. Because their single knockouts have different effects.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. I don't think so.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. But their functions are additive, not redundant.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is not listed, but since I have to choose, perhaps the best fit is option D, even though I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the question says that at least one gene is a transcription factor. So G2 is the TF.

Looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is TF. No.

Option B: G2 is TF, but then G1 and G3 have same promoter, which I'm not sure about.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy — no.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 redundant.

Given that, and the fact that in the data, G1 and G3 are additive, option D's statement about redundancy is incorrect. So perhaps the correct option is not among the choices, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, because neither G1 nor G3 can provide full resistance when one is knocked out, but together they contribute, implying redundancy.

Wait, but in the data, each single mutant has some resistance, but the double mutant is worse. So that's more like additive than redundant.

Hmm. Another possibility is that G1 and G3 are both downstream of G2, each in their own pathway, and they contribute to the same process. So their functions are complementary, not redundant.

In that case, their combined knockout would lead to worse resistance, which is what's observed.

So, in this scenario, G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in separate pathways.

Looking at the options, none of them directly state that, but perhaps option D's 'gene redundancy' is closest.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

But I'm not convinced.

At this point, perhaps the best approach is to eliminate options. 

Since G2 is a TF, options A is out.

In the data, G3's knockout is worse than G1's. So G3 has a more significant role.

If G3 is epistatic to G1 (option B), then in the g1 mutant, the resistance should be same as wild type, but in data, it's 75%. So that doesn't fit.

Option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. So if G1 is epistatic, then in the g3 mutant, the resistance would be same as wild type, which isn't the case. So option D is incorrect.

So, back to the options, perhaps the correct answer is option B, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps I should think about what 'showing the same promoter' implies. If G1 and G3 have the same promoter, they are co-regulated. So perhaps G2's TF activity binds to their promoters, activating both. So without G2, neither is expressed.

But in the data, when G1 is knocked out (g1), G2 is active, so G3 is expressed. So the resistance is 75%.

When G3 is knocked out (g3), G2 is active, so G1 is expressed. Resistance is 50%.

So that fits with G2 activating both, but each having their own contribution.

So option B says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, and G3 is epistatic towards G1.

But I don't see how G3 would be epistatic.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, but I'm not certain.

Another angle: in the double mutants, g1g2 and g2g3 are both 0%, same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. So the only option that refers to G2 being epistatic is option A, but it says G1 is TF, which is wrong.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but that's incorrect because G2 is the TF.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the data, G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are downstream in separate pathways, each contributing to resistance.

Looking at the options, none perfectly fit. But the closest is option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But I still don't see it.

Wait, perhaps the right option is option D. Because in the data, when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either, which suggests redundancy. But I'm not entirely sure.

After all this, I think the correct answer is option D.

The question involves determining the interactions between three candidate genes (G1, G2, G3) and their contributions to resistance against anthracnose in white lupine. The experimental data provides resistance levels for single and double mutants, and the goal is to infer gene interactions, particularly focusing on whether one gene is a transcription factor (TF) and the nature of their relationships (e.g., redundancy, pleiotropy, epistasis).

### Key Observations from the Data:
1. **G2 knockout (g2):** Resistance is 0%, indicating G2 is critical for resistance. This suggests G2 is likely a transcription factor (TF) upstream of other genes.
2. **G1 knockout (g1):** Resistance is 75%, indicating G1 contributes to resistance but is not as critical as G2.
3. **G3 knockout (g3):** Resistance is 50%, indicating G3 is important but less so than G2.
4. **Double mutants:**
   - **g1g3:** Resistance is 10%, worse than either single mutant, suggesting additive contributions from G1 and G3.
   - **g1g2 and g2g3:** Resistance is 0%, same as g2, indicating G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

### Analysis of Gene Interactions:
- **G2 as a Transcription Factor:** The complete loss of resistance in g2 suggests G2 is upstream and likely regulates other genes, such as G1 and G3.
- **G1 and G3 Contributions:** The resistance levels of single mutants (g1: 75%, g3: 50%) indicate that G1 and G3 contribute to resistance but are not essential on their own. Their combined knockout (g1g3: 10%) shows their contributions are additive, not redundant.
- **Epistasis:** The resistance levels of double mutants (g1g2 and g2g3) being identical to g2 (0%) confirm that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. This means G2's function masks the effects of G1 and G3 when absent.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A:** States G1 is a transcription factor, which is inconsistent with the data, as G2's knockout has the most severe phenotype (0% resistance). **Eliminated.**
- **Option B:** States G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, and G3 is epistatic towards G1. While G2 being a TF fits, the data does not support G3 being epistatic towards G1, as g1 retains 75% resistance. **Eliminated.**
- **Option C:** States G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. Pleiotropy is not evident, as G1 and G3 do not affect multiple traits. Additionally, G1 is not epistatic towards G3, as g3 has a worse phenotype than g1. **Eliminated.**
- **Option D:** States G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. While the data does not strongly support redundancy (their contributions are additive), this option aligns most closely with the observed hierarchy and relationships between the genes. **Best fit.**

### Conclusion:
Based on the data, G2 is the transcription factor, and the relationships between G1 and G3 are best described by additive contributions rather than redundancy. However, among the given options, **Option D** is the most consistent with the experimental results.

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but let's try to work through it. So the question is about gene interactions in plants and their resistance to a fungal disease called anthracnose. 

So, from what I understand, the setup is that they've done a high-throughput experiment and found three candidate genes: G1, G2, G3. They created knock-out mutants for each, and also some double mutants. The goal is to figure out how these genes interact in terms of contributing to disease resistance.

The data given shows the resistance levels of each mutant compared to the wild type. Wild type is 100%, so higher is better resistance. So, looking at the data:

- g1 (G1 knockout): 75% resistance. So less than wild type but not super bad.
- g2: 0% — that's really bad. So the plant can't resist the fungus at all without G2.
- g3: 50% — so half the resistance of wild type.
- Double mutants:
  - g1g3: 10% — that's even worse than either g1 or g3.
  - g2g3: 0% — same as g2.
  - g1g2: 0% — same as g2.

Hmm, what's the pattern here? Let's think about what these results mean.

So, when a gene is knocked out and the plant's resistance goes down, that gene must contribute to resistance. If the resistance drops a lot, or even completely, that suggests the gene plays a key role.

Looking at g2: when G2 is knocked out alone, the resistance is 0%. That's a big effect. So perhaps G2 is a critical gene, maybe a transcription factor that activates other genes needed for resistance. Because if G2 is a transcription factor, then without it, none of the downstream genes would be expressed. So other genes that are part of the resistance pathway wouldn't be active, leading to no resistance.

Now, the double mutants: g1g3 has 10%. Both G1 and G3 are knocked out, but the resistance is even lower than either single knockout. Wait, but let's think: g1 alone is 75, g3 alone is 50. Why is the double mutant worse than both? That suggests that perhaps G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, but somehow their functions are additive. Or maybe when both are out, the plant can't do anything. Alternatively, this might not be the case.

Wait, but let's look at the other double mutants. For g2g3, it's 0% — same as g2. So when both G2 and G3 are knocked out, there's no change in resistance compared to just G2 alone. So that suggests that G3's function is redundant or perhaps downstream of G2. Because if G3's function is already inactive when G2 is knocked out, then knocking out G3 doesn't make it worse.

Similarly, g1g2 is 0%, which is the same as g2. So when G1 is knocked out along with G2, it's no better than just G2. So maybe G1 is downstream of G2, or perhaps G1's function is only contributing when G2 is present.

Wait, but g1 alone has 75% resistance. So without G1, the resistance is lower, but not gone. So perhaps G1 is part of a parallel pathway, or maybe it's a downstream gene. Let's think about the hierarchy.

Since g2 alone gives 0% resistance, which is a complete loss, it's possible that G2 is a transcription factor that activates other genes, including G1 and G3. So if G2 is a transcription factor, then without G2, the expression of G1 and G3 would be affected. But wait, in the data, G1 and G3 are knocked out individually, so their expression would be gone whether G2 is present or not. Hmm, but perhaps G2 is required for their activation.

Wait, but if G2 is a transcription factor upstream of G1 and G3, then knocking out G2 would also knock out the expression of G1 and G3. But in the data, G1 and G3 knockouts have some resistance. So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is upstream of a pathway, and G1 and G3 are downstream.

Wait, let's think about what the double mutants are showing.

In the case where G2 is knocked out (g2), the resistance is 0%. So the only way to get any resistance would be if other genes are contributing. But without G2, perhaps G1 and G3 can't function, or their function isn't enough.

Wait, but when G2 is knocked out along with G3 (g2g3), the resistance is still 0%, same as g2. So the presence of the G3 knockout doesn't make it any worse. So this suggests that G3's pathway is redundant or that it's not contributing when G2 is absent. Alternatively, G3's function is downstream of G2, so without G2, G3 can't contribute.

Hmm, but when G2 is present (as in wild type), G3 has a certain effect. Let's think about the single mutants: g3 has 50% resistance, which is better than g2 (0%) but worse than g1 (75%). So without G3, the plant's resistance is half. So perhaps G3 is part of a separate pathway that contributes to resistance.

Wait, but when both G1 and G3 are knocked out (g1g3), the resistance is 10%. That's worse than either single mutant. So maybe G1 and G3 are in separate pathways that both contribute to resistance. If both are out, then the plant has only 10% resistance. So each contributes a portion.

But when G2 is knocked out, the resistance is 0%, which is worse than either G1 or G3 knockout. So perhaps G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3. If G2 is a transcription factor, for example, it activates G1 and G3 expression. So without G2, G1 and G3 aren't expressed, leading to no resistance.

But wait, the single mutants g1 and g3 have some resistance. So in the wild type, G1 and G3 must be expressed even without G2? Or maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps G2 is required for their expression. Let's think.

If G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1 and G3, then in wild type, G2 is present, so G1 and G3 are expressed. But in the g2 mutant, G1 and G3 aren't expressed. So in that case, the single mutants (g1 and g3) would have some level of resistance because the other gene is still present.

But wait, when G2 is knocked out, the resistance is 0%, which is worse than either g1 or g3. That suggests that the presence of G2 is necessary for the plant's resistance, perhaps through activating other genes.

Wait, but how does that fit with the other results? Let's try to model this.

If G2 is a transcription factor, which activates G1 and G3, then in the wild type, all three are functional. So, in g2, G1 and G3 aren't expressed (or their expression is reduced). But the single mutants (g1 and g3) would have the other gene still active. So, for example, in g1, G3 is active because G2 is present. Similarly, in g3, G1 is active.

Wait, but in the data, g1's resistance is 75% of wild type. So without G1, the resistance drops from 100% to 75%. So G1 contributes 25% of the resistance. Similarly, g3 is 50% — so it contributes 50% of the resistance. Hmm, but that doesn't quite add up because when both are knocked out (g1g3), the resistance is 10%, which is much lower than either.

Wait, perhaps their contributions are additive. So G1 and G3 function in parallel pathways. So when G1 is out, the contribution from G1's pathway is gone. G3 is in another pathway. So if both are out, then 10% is the residual resistance from other pathways.

But then, what's the role of G2? Because in the g2 mutant, the resistance is 0%, which is worse than any other single mutant. So without G2, the plant can't resist anthracnose at all. So G2 must be upstream of both G1 and G3, perhaps activating them.

Wait, but if G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1 and G3, then in the g2 mutant, G1 and G3 aren't expressed. So the single mutants g1 and g3 would have some level of resistance because only one of G1 or G3 is knocked out, and the other is still active. But if both G1 and G3 are knocked out, then resistance would be even worse.

But in the data, g1g3 is 10% resistance. So without both G1 and G3, the plant's resistance is worse than either single. So that supports the idea that G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, and that their combined absence leads to worse resistance.

But wait, the wild type has 100% resistance. If G1 contributes 25% (as in, 25% of the resistance is from G1, and G3 contributes 50%), then without G2, perhaps neither G1 nor G3 are expressed, leading to 0% resistance. That would make sense.

So, if G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1 and G3, then without G2 (g2), both G1 and G3 are not expressed. So the plant can't rely on either, hence 0% resistance.

In the single mutants, g1 can't express G1 because it's knocked out, but G3 is expressed because G2 is active. Similarly, in g3, G1 is expressed (since G2 is active), but G3 is knocked out.

Wait, but in the data, g1 has 75% resistance. If G1 contributes 25%, then the plant can still get 75% from G3. Similarly, g3 has 50% — so maybe G3 contributes 50% and G1 contributes 25%, but perhaps there's another pathway contributing the remaining 25%.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 is part of a pathway that contributes 25%, G3 another that contributes 50%, and there's a third pathway contributing the remaining 25%. But without G2, all these pathways are disabled, leading to 0% resistance.

Wait, but if G2 is required for the expression of G1 and G3, then in the g1 mutant, G2 is present but G1 is knocked out. So G3 is expressed because G2 is active. So in that case, the resistance should be 50% (if G3 contributes 50% and G1 25%, but G1 is knocked out, so 50% resistance. But the data says g1 has 75% resistance. Hmm, that contradicts.

Wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Let me think differently.

Another approach: look for epistatic relationships. Epistasis occurs when the effect of one gene is dependent on the presence of one or more 'modifier genes'. If a gene A is epistatic to gene B, it means that the phenotype of gene B is only visible when gene A is present.

In the context of the problem, the resistance levels can indicate an epistatic relationship. 

Looking at the double mutants:

- g1g2: 0% resistance. Same as g2. So the presence of G1 mutation in the g2 background doesn't change the phenotype. So, perhaps G1 is downstream of G2. Because if G2 is knocked out, knocking out G1 doesn't make it worse. So G2 is epistatic to G1. Because G2's function is upstream, so whether G1 is present or not doesn't matter once G2 is gone.

Similarly, g2g3: 0% same as g2. So again, G3's knockout in the g2 background doesn't change resistance. So G2 is epistatic to G3 as well.

What about g1g3: 10% resistance. Both G1 and G3 are knocked out. The resistance is worse than either single mutant. So their effects are additive, perhaps.

So, putting this together:

G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. That suggests that G2 is upstream of both. So, if G2 is not functioning, then the functions of G1 and G3 don't matter because they can't contribute. 

So, G2 is a transcription factor upstream of G1 and G3. Without G2, G1 and G3 can't function, hence 0% resistance.

In the g1 mutant, G2 is present, so G3 can function. G3 contributes 50% of the resistance, so the g1 mutant has 75% (since G1 contributes 25% and G3 is fully functional). Wait, but 75% is higher than G3's 50% contribution. Hmm, maybe there's more to it.

Wait, maybe I should model it as:

- Wild type: G2 is active, so G1 and G3 are active. Their combined function leads to 100% resistance.

- g1: G1 is inactive, but G2 and G3 are active. So G3 contributes some resistance. But according to the data, g1 has 75% resistance. So perhaps G3 contributes 75% when active, and G1 is contributing 25% when active.

Wait no, because when G3 is knocked out (g3), the resistance is 50% — which would suggest that G3 contributes 50%. Because without G3, you're left with whatever G1 contributes, which is 75% - but wait, no, because in g1, resistance is 75%, which would imply that G3 contributes 25% and G1 contributes 75%? But then in g3, the resistance is 50%, which would mean that G1 contributes 50% when G3 is out. That doesn't quite add up.

Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, each contributing to resistance. So, G1 contributes 25% and G3 contributes 50%, adding up to 75%. But then, when both are out (g1g3), the resistance is 10%, perhaps from another pathway.

Wait, let's think of each gene's contribution as additive.

Wild type: 100% = G1 (25%) + G3 (50%) + other (25%).

So:

- g1: G1 is out, so 0 + 50 (G3) + 25 (other) = 75% — matches the data.
- g3: G3 is out, so 25 (G1) + 0 + 25 (other) = 50% — matches.
- g1g3: Both out, so 0 + 0 + 25 = 25%. But the data says 10% — doesn't match. Hmm, discrepancy here. So maybe there's another factor.

Alternatively, perhaps when both G1 and G3 are out, the other pathways aren't sufficient. Or maybe there's some interaction where their combined absence leads to a worse outcome.

Wait, but the other double mutants:

g1g2: 0% — same as g2.
g2g3: 0% — same as g2.

Which supports that G2 is upstream of both, so without G2, the other genes don't matter.

So, G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1 and G3. Without G2, G1 and G3 can't function, leading to 0% resistance.

In the single mutants:

g1: G2 is active, so G3 is active. So resistance is from G3 and any other factors. If G3 contributes 50%, but in the data, g1 is 75% — so maybe G1 contributes another 25%, or perhaps other factors.

Wait, perhaps G1 and G3 are both downstream of G2, but they function in separate pathways. So in g1, G3 is active, contributing 50%, and in g3, G1 is active, contributing 25%. But in the wild type, both G1 and G3 are active, so 50% +25% =75%, but the wild type is 100% — so that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps each gene contributes multiplicatively. So, the wild type has all three genes active, so 100% resistance. If any gene is knocked out, resistance is the product of the remaining genes' contributions.

But that's getting a bit complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates a set of genes, including G1 and G3. So, without G2, none of those downstream genes are expressed, leading to no resistance. 

In the single mutants:

g2 is 0% — no G2, so no resistance.
g1: G2 is present, so G2 is active, and so are other downstream genes, including G3. So the resistance is due to G3 and any other downstream genes. But according to the data, g1's resistance is 75%. So if G3 is active, perhaps it contributes 75% of the resistance, while G1 contributes the remaining 25% — but I'm not sure.

Wait, but in the g3 mutant, the resistance is 50%. So, without G3, but G2 is active and G1 is present, the plant has 50% resistance. So perhaps G1 contributes 50% when G3 is out.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let's try to approach it from the options given.

The options are:

A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Wait, but in the data, g2 is the most severe. If G1 were a transcription factor, then knocking it out would have a bigger effect. But in the data, g1 has 75% resistance, which is not as bad as g2's 0%. So maybe G1 isn't the transcription factor.

Option B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Hmm, I'm not sure what having the same promoter would mean. If G1 and G3 are co-promoted, perhaps they are co-expressed. But I'm not sure how that would affect the resistance levels. Also, G3 being epistatic towards G1 would mean that G3's function masks G1's effect. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Option C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy means that a single gene affects multiple traits. I'm not sure how that applies here. Plus, G1 being epistatic towards G3 would mean that G1's function masks G3's. But in the data, when both are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either, which suggests their functions are additive, not epistatic.

Option D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy means that the functions of G1 and G3 are overlapping, so knocking out both leads to a more severe phenotype. But in the data, when both are knocked out (g1g3), the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either alone. So that's consistent with redundancy. Also, if G1 is epistatic towards G3, then G1's function masks G3's. But I'm not sure how that fits with the data.

Wait, let me look again. The question states that at least one of the genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So likely, G2 is this transcription factor because its knockout is the most severe.

So, considering that:

If G2 is the transcription factor, then it must be upstream of G1 and G3.

In the g2 mutant, resistance is 0% — so G2 is essential for resistance.

In the g1 mutant, G2 is present, so G1 is knocked out but G3 is active. So the resistance is 75% — which is better than g2's 0%, but worse than wild type.

In the g3 mutant, G2 is present, so G3 is knocked out but G1 is active. Resistance is 50% — which is worse than g1's 75%.

So, when G2 is present, both G1 and G3 contribute to resistance. But if either is knocked out, the remaining gene contributes some resistance. When both are knocked out (g1g3), resistance drops to 10%, which is worse than either single. So that suggests that G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, contributing additively.

But when G2 is knocked out, neither G1 nor G3 can contribute, leading to 0% resistance.

So, the conclusion is that G2 is a transcription factor upstream of both G1 and G3.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A says G1 is a TF. No, because in the data, G2's knockout is the most severe.

Option B says G2 is a TF, which is correct. Then, G1 and G3 have same promoter. Not sure about that.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. Hmm, not sure.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. Gene redundancy would mean that if one is knocked out, the other can compensate. But in the data, knocking out either leads to some resistance reduction, but knocking both leads to more reduction. So that suggests redundancy, but their effects are additive, which is more like separate pathways.

Wait, but redundancy is when two genes have overlapping functions, so knocking out both leads to a more severe phenotype than either alone. That's what we're seeing with g1g3 having 10% compared to 75% and 50%. So that supports redundancy.

So, in this case, G1 and G3 are redundant. They each contribute to resistance, and when both are knocked out, the resistance drops more.

But wait, the question says that at least one is a TF. So we concluded G2 is the TF.

So in option D, "G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3."

Wait, but in the data, G1's knockout has higher resistance than G3's. So perhaps G1 contributes more than G3.

Wait, no, when G1 is knocked out, resistance is 75%, which is better than when G3 is knocked out (50%). So G3's knockout leads to worse resistance than G1's. That suggests that G3's function is more critical than G1's.

So if G1 is epistatic towards G3, that would mean that G1's function masks G3's. But in reality, G3's knockout has a worse effect than G1's. So perhaps G3 is epistatic towards G1? Or maybe the other way around.

Wait, epistasis is about the position in the pathway. If gene A is epistatic to gene B, it means that A is downstream of B. So the phenotype of B can only be seen if A is present.

But in our case, the double mutants are all worse than either single, which suggests that their functions are additive, not epistatic.

Hmm. Let me think again about each option.

Option A: G1 is a TF. But data contradicts that. So not this.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter (I'm not sure about this), and G3 is epistatic towards G1. So if G3 is epistatic, then G3's function would mask G1's. But in the data, when G3 is knocked out, the resistance is worse than when G1 is knocked out. So if G3 is epistatic, then perhaps in g1, the resistance should be same as wild type, which is not the case. So this might not fit.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. Pleiotropy is when a gene affects multiple traits, but I'm not sure how that applies here. Also, if G1 is epistatic, then in the g3 mutant, G1's presence would mask G3's effect. But in data, g3 resistance is 50%, which is worse than g1's 75%. So not clear.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, redundancy would mean that each gene contributes the same function, so knocking out both would have a more severe effect. So that fits with g1g3 being worse than either. But the question is, are their functions redundant or additive?

In additive, their effects are separate. So when both are out, the sum of their effects is subtracted. If they're redundant, same function, so their combined knockout is worse than either.

So, in the data, g1g3 is 10% — worse than either. So that's consistent with redundancy.

Now, G1 is epistatic towards G3. So, if G1 is epistatic, it would mean that G1's function is downstream of G3. But in the data, when G3 is knocked out (g3), the resistance is 50%, which is worse than when G1 is knocked out (75%). So in that case, G3's knockout has a bigger effect, suggesting that G3 is epistatic to G1.

Wait, because if G3 is epistatic, then without G3, you don't see the effect of G1.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of it in terms of pathways.

If G2 is a TF that activates both G1 and G3, then G1 and G3 are downstream of G2.

In the wild type, all three are functional.

In g1: G1 is knocked out, G2 and G3 are active. So the plant can rely on G3's function, leading to 75% resistance.

In g3: G3 is knocked out, G2 and G1 are active. So the plant relies on G1's function, leading to 50% resistance.

Wait, that would mean that G3 contributes more to resistance than G1. Because without G3, the resistance drops more.

In g1g3: both are knocked out, so resistance is 10% — perhaps because other pathways contribute a little, but without G2's activation, that's it.

So, in this model:

- G2 is the TF, upstream of both G1 and G3.
- G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, each contributing to resistance, but G3 contributes more.
- When both are knocked out, the remaining resistance is minimal.

So, looking at the options, which one fits this?

Option D says: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but G1 and G3 don't show redundancy because knocking out each leads to different resistances. Instead, their functions are additive.

So, perhaps the correct model is that G1 and G3 are in separate (non-redundant) pathways, both activated by G2. So in that case, neither is redundant, but their functions add. So when both are knocked out, the effect is additive.

Looking back at the options, none of them directly state that G1 and G3 are additive.

Wait, perhaps I should look again. The options are:

A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

B) G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

C) G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

D) G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Hmm. So from the data, G2 is the TF.

So, cross options:

Options B, C, D have G2 as TF. 

So the options would be B, C, or D.

Now, looking at the other parts.

Option B says G1 and G3 have the same promoter. I'm not sure what that implies.

Option C says G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits. But in this case, G1 and G3 each affect the same trait (resistance) but in different ways. So perhaps they are not pleiotropic.

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. That would mean that they have the same function, so knocking both out would lead to a worse phenotype. Which seems to fit with the data.

But in the data, G1 and G3 are in different pathways. So perhaps the redundancy is in their functions. So, G1 and G3 are redundant in their functions, meaning each can contribute to the same aspect of resistance.

In that case, the data shows that when both are knocked out, the resistance is much lower. So redundancy fits, but how about the epistatic part?

Option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. So G1's function is downstream of G3. But in the data, when G3 is knocked out, the resistance is 50%, which is worse than when G1 is knocked out (75%). So perhaps G3's function is more critical, which would suggest that G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Wait, but in the case where G3 is epistatic towards G1, that would mean that without G3, G1's function doesn't matter. But in the data, when G3 is knocked out, G1 is still present. So perhaps the model is that G3 is epistatic to G1.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on this. Another approach: the presence of epistasis is when the phenotype of a mutation in one gene masks the effect of another gene.

In the case of g1g3, the resistance is worse than either, so their effects are additive, not epistatic. So perhaps neither is epistatic.

But the options suggest that in the correct answer, one is epistatic.

Looking back, the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 have the same resistance as g2, which is 0%. That suggests that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. Because in the absence of G2, the functions of G1 and G3 don't matter.

So G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. So the epistatic relationships are:

G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

But none of the options mention G2 being epistatic. Let me check the options again.

Option A: G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Option B: G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Option C: G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Option D: G1 is epistatic towards G3.

So the correct epistatic relationship is that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

But none of the options explicitly state that. So perhaps the closest is option A, but G2 isn't the TF in option A.

Wait, no, option A says G1 is TF, which doesn't fit.

So perhaps the correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are downstream and additive.

But the options don't state that, so perhaps I have to choose the best fit.

Looking at the options, option D says G1 and G3 are redundant, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But in the data, G3's knockout is worse than G1's, which would suggest that G3 is more important, so perhaps G3 is epistatic.

Wait, but if G3 is epistatic, then in the g1 mutant, the resistance would be same as wild type, because G3 is present. But in the data, g1 has 75% resistance, which is not 100% as wild type.

So that doesn't fit. So perhaps option B is incorrect.

Hmm. Let me think about the possible hierarchy.

If G2 is a TF that activates G1 and G3, then G2 is at the top. G1 and G3 are in separate pathways.

In the wild type, all three are active, leading to 100% resistance.

In g1: G2 and G3 are active, so resistance is due to G3 and any other factors. So 75% suggests that G3 contributes 75% of the resistance.

In g3: G2 and G1 are active, so G1 contributes 50% of the resistance.

Wait, but that's inconsistent. Why would G3 contribute more than G1?

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is necessary for the expression of both G1 and G3.

In the wild type, all are on, so resistance is 100%.

In g1: G2 is on, so G3 is active. So resistance is determined by G3 — which is 75%.

In g3: G2 is on, so G1 is active. Resistance is determined by G1 — 50%.

In g1g3: both G1 and G3 are off. So resistance is 0% if no other pathways, but the data says 10%. Hmm, perhaps 10% comes from another pathway.

In the double mutants with G2 knocked out (g1g2 and g2g3), resistance is 0%, same as g2.

So, putting this together, G2 is the TF activating G1 and G3. G1 and G3 are in separate pathways contributing 50% and 75% respectively. When both are knocked out, perhaps the remaining resistance is only 10% from another pathway. So the data supports this.

Now, looking back at the options, which option aligns with this conclusion?

Option D says G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But my model suggests that G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, not redundant. So perhaps none of the options perfectly fit, but we have to choose the best one.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is B: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

But I'm not sure about the same promoter part.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct conclusion is that G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are downstream, with G3 being more critical.

But looking at the options again:

Option B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Hmm, same promoter would mean they are co-regulated. So, if G2 is the TF, perhaps it activates both, which is what we thought.

If G3 is epistatic towards G1, then when G3 is knocked out, the resistance would be determined by G1's function. But in the data, when G3 is knocked out, the resistance is 50%, which is worse than G1's knockout (75%). So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps epistasis in this context refers to the position in the pathway. If G3 is downstream of G1, then G3's function could be epistatic.

But I'm getting stuck. I think the best fit is option D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but I thought redundancy would mean that knocking out both leads to a worse phenotype, which is the case here (g1g3 is 10%). So D seems to fit that part.

Moreover, if G1 is epistatic towards G3, then G1's function is downstream of G3. So, in g3, the resistance is determined by G1's function.

In the data, when G3 is knocked out, resistance is 50% (g3), which is worse than when G1 is knocked out (75%). So that suggests that G3's function is more critical. So perhaps G3 is epistatic to G1, making option B or C more likely.

But in option B, G3 is epistatic towards G1. So in g1, the resistance would be same as wild type, but in the data, g1 is 75%, which is less than wild type. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm.

Another approach: Since g1g3 is worse than either, their functions are additive. So they are not redundant, but contribute different parts. So perhaps the correct option is not D.

But all the options with G2 as TF are B, C, D.

Option C: G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. I don't think that's the case.

So perhaps the correct answer is option A, but no, because G2 is the TF.

Wait, perhaps the best fit is option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy.

In that case, G1 and G3 are redundant, meaning they have the same function. So when both are knocked out, resistance is worse.

But in the data, in g1, the resistance is 75%, and in g3 it is 50%. So if they were redundant, knocking out either would have similar effects. But this isn't the case. So redundancy doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Same promoter would mean that G1 and G3 are co-regulated by G2.

If G3 is epistatic towards G1, then in the g1 mutant, the resistance would be same as wild type, but in the data, it's 75% — so that doesn't fit.

I'm getting stuck. Perhaps I should go back to what each option implies.

The question is about which conclusion can be drawn from the experiment.

Key points from the data:

- G2 knockout is lethal for resistance.
- G1 and G3 knockouts have partial resistance.
- Double knockouts with G2 are as bad as G2 alone.
- G1 and G3 double knockout is worse than either alone.

So, G2 is epistatic over G1 and G3, meaning it's upstream. So G2 is the TF.

G1 and G3 are in separate pathways contributing to resistance. Their combined knockout leads to additive reduction in resistance.

Looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is TF. No, because G2's knockout is worse.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter. So same regulation. So G2 activates both. But the data doesn't suggest that they are in the same pathway. Because their single knockouts have different effects.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. I don't think so.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. But their functions are additive, not redundant.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is not listed, but since I have to choose, perhaps the best fit is option D, even though I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the question says that at least one gene is a transcription factor. So G2 is the TF.

Looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is TF. No.

Option B: G2 is TF, but then G1 and G3 have same promoter, which I'm not sure about.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy — no.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 redundant.

Given that, and the fact that in the data, G1 and G3 are additive, option D's statement about redundancy is incorrect. So perhaps the correct option is not among the choices, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, because neither G1 nor G3 can provide full resistance when one is knocked out, but together they contribute, implying redundancy.

Wait, but in the data, each single mutant has some resistance, but the double mutant is worse. So that's more like additive than redundant.

Hmm. Another possibility is that G1 and G3 are both downstream of G2, each in their own pathway, and they contribute to the same process. So their functions are complementary, not redundant.

In that case, their combined knockout would lead to worse resistance, which is what's observed.

So, in this scenario, G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in separate pathways.

Looking at the options, none of them directly state that, but perhaps option D's 'gene redundancy' is closest.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

But I'm not convinced.

At this point, perhaps the best approach is to eliminate options. 

Since G2 is a TF, options A is out.

In the data, G3's knockout is worse than G1's. So G3 has a more significant role.

If G3 is epistatic to G1 (option B), then in the g1 mutant, the resistance should be same as wild type, but in data, it's 75%. So that doesn't fit.

Option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. So if G1 is epistatic, then in the g3 mutant, the resistance would be same as wild type, which isn't the case. So option D is incorrect.

So, back to the options, perhaps the correct answer is option B, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps I should think about what 'showing the same promoter' implies. If G1 and G3 have the same promoter, they are co-regulated. So perhaps G2's TF activity binds to their promoters, activating both. So without G2, neither is expressed.

But in the data, when G1 is knocked out (g1), G2 is active, so G3 is expressed. So the resistance is 75%.

When G3 is knocked out (g3), G2 is active, so G1 is expressed. Resistance is 50%.

So that fits with G2 activating both, but each having their own contribution.

So option B says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, and G3 is epistatic towards G1.

But I don't see how G3 would be epistatic.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, but I'm not certain.

Another angle: in the double mutants, g1g2 and g2g3 are both 0%, same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. So the only option that refers to G2 being epistatic is option A, but it says G1 is TF, which is wrong.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but that's incorrect because G2 is the TF.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the data, G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are downstream in separate pathways, each contributing to resistance.

Looking at the options, none perfectly fit. But the closest is option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But I still don't see it.

Wait, perhaps the right option is option D. Because in the data, when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either, which suggests redundancy. But I'm not entirely sure.

After all this, I think the correct answer is option D.


The question involves determining the interactions between three candidate genes (G1, G2, G3) and their contributions to resistance against anthracnose in white lupine. The experimental data provides resistance levels for single and double mutants, and the goal is to infer gene interactions, particularly focusing on whether one gene is a transcription factor (TF) and the nature of their relationships (e.g., redundancy, pleiotropy, epistasis).

### Key Observations from the Data:
1. **G2 knockout (g2):** Resistance is 0%, indicating G2 is critical for resistance. This suggests G2 is likely a transcription factor (TF) upstream of other genes.
2. **G1 knockout (g1):** Resistance is 75%, indicating G1 contributes to resistance but is not as critical as G2.
3. **G3 knockout (g3):** Resistance is 50%, indicating G3 is important but less so than G2.
4. **Double mutants:**
   - **g1g3:** Resistance is 10%, worse than either single mutant, suggesting additive contributions from G1 and G3.
   - **g1g2 and g2g3:** Resistance is 0%, same as g2, indicating G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

### Analysis of Gene Interactions:
- **G2 as a Transcription Factor:** The complete loss of resistance in g2 suggests G2 is upstream and likely regulates other genes, such as G1 and G3.
- **G1 and G3 Contributions:** The resistance levels of single mutants (g1: 75%, g3: 50%) indicate that G1 and G3 contribute to resistance but are not essential on their own. Their combined knockout (g1g3: 10%) shows their contributions are additive, not redundant.
- **Epistasis:** The resistance levels of double mutants (g1g2 and g2g3) being identical to g2 (0%) confirm that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. This means G2's function masks the effects of G1 and G3 when absent.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A:** States G1 is a transcription factor, which is inconsistent with the data, as G2's knockout has the most severe phenotype (0% resistance). **Eliminated.**
- **Option B:** States G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, and G3 is epistatic towards G1. While G2 being a TF fits, the data does not support G3 being epistatic towards G1, as g1 retains 75% resistance. **Eliminated.**
- **Option C:** States G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. Pleiotropy is not evident, as G1 and G3 do not affect multiple traits. Additionally, G1 is not epistatic towards G3, as g3 has a worse phenotype than g1. **Eliminated.**
- **Option D:** States G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. While the data does not strongly support redundancy (their contributions are additive), this option aligns most closely with the observed hierarchy and relationships between the genes. **Best fit.**

### Conclusion:
Based on the data, G2 is the transcription factor, and the relationships between G1 and G3 are best described by additive contributions rather than redundancy. However, among the given options, **Option D** is the most consistent with the experimental results.

**Answer: D**
