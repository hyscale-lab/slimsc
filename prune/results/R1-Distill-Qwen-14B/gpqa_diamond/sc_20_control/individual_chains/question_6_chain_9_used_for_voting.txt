Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of all these concepts. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that a quantum mechanical particle of mass m is moving in two dimensions in a potential V(r, θ) given by ½ kr² + (3/2) kr² cos²(θ). I need to find the energy spectrum from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the Hamiltonian of a system is important because the energy eigenvalues come from solving the Schrödinger equation. So the potential here is r-dependent and also has a θ-dependent term multiplied by r². 

Wait, the potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2) k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let me think about this. I've heard of potentials like the harmonic oscillator. This looks a bit like a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator, but with an additional term involving cos²θ. 

In polar coordinates, the Hamiltonian for a particle in a central potential (which depends only on r) would be H = (p_r²)/(2m) + (p_θ²)/(2m r²) + V(r). But wait, our V here isn't just a function of r; it has a cos²θ term. That complicates things because it introduces angular dependence.

Oh, wait a second. The potential can be written as V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let's factor that. Let me see, 1/2 kr² is like a standard harmonic oscillator term, and the second part is (3/2) kr² cos²θ. Hmm, maybe I can rewrite this in terms of sin² and cos² to see if it separates into radial and angular parts.

Wait, cos²θ can be written using the double-angle identity. Remember that cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So substituting that in, the potential becomes:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² * (1 + cos2θ)/2.

Let me compute that. (3/2)k r² times 1/2 is (3/4)k r², and (3/2)k r² times cos2θ/2 is (3/4)k r² cos2θ. So putting it all together:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ.

Wait, 1/2 plus 3/4 is 5/4. So V(r,θ) = (5/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ. Hmm, interesting. But how does that help me? Maybe I can think about the symmetry of the system.

Alternatively, perhaps a coordinate transformation or change of variables would help. I'm thinking that the presence of cos2θ suggests some kind of angular momentum term or anharmonic potential. Or maybe the potential can be expressed in terms that separate the radial and angular parts.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian in polar coordinates is:

H = (-ħ²/(2m))(1/r ∂/∂r (r ∂/∂r) ) + (-ħ²/(2m r²)) (∂²/∂θ²) ) + V(r,θ).

But with the potential V(r,θ) having that cos2θ term, this could mix the angular and radial parts, which complicates things. Unless the potential can be expressed in a way that allows the Hamiltonian to separate into radial and angular parts.

Wait, another thought: perhaps using the quantum numbers nx and ny. Wait, no, in two dimensions, sometimes problems are separable in Cartesian coordinates. Wait, but the potential is in polar coordinates. Alternatively, maybe the potential can be rewritten in terms of Cartesian coordinates to make it separable.

Wait, cos²θ can be expressed in terms of x and y. Because in polar coordinates, x = r cosθ and y = r sinθ. So cosθ = x/r, so cos²θ = x²/(r²). So the potential V(r,θ) can be written as:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² (x² / r²) ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k x².

But wait, that's an interesting observation. So V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k x². Let me expand r²: r² = x² + y². So substituting that in:

V = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x².

Let me compute that. (1/2)k x² + (1/2)k y² + (3/2)k x² = [ (1/2 + 3/2) k x² ] + (1/2)k y².

Which simplifies to 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Wait, that's not right. Let me compute 1/2 + 3/2: that's 2. So V = 2 k x² + (1/2)k y².

Hmm, so the potential in Cartesian coordinates is V(x,y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y². So this is a two-dimensional anharmonic oscillator, but with different coefficients for x and y.

Wait, but in Cartesian coordinates, the Hamiltonian would be H = p_x²/(2m) + p_y²/(2m) + 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Wait, why? Because the original potential was in polar, but after transformation, it's expressed in terms of x and y. So in this form, each direction (x and y) has its own harmonic oscillator potential but with different frequencies.

In a harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are quantized as E = (n_x + 1/2 ) ħω_x, where ω_x is the angular frequency for that direction. Similarly for y.

But in this case, the potential is quadratic in x and y, so each direction is a harmonic oscillator with their own frequencies. So the total energy would be the sum of the energies in x and y.

So, for the x direction, the potential is 2k x². The standard harmonic oscillator potential is (1/2) m ω² x². So comparing, 2k x² = (1/2) m ω_x² x² → ω_x² = (4k)/m → ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m). So the energy for x would be (n_x + 1/2) ħ ω_x = (n_x + 1/2) ħ * 2 sqrt(k/m) = (2n_x +1) ħ sqrt(k/m) * (1/2) * 2? Wait, no, let me compute it correctly.

Wait, the standard HO energy for x is (n_x + 1/2) ħ ω_x, where ω_x = sqrt(k_x/m), with k_x being the spring constant for that direction. In this case, for x, the potential is 2k x², which would imply that k_x = 4k? Because 2k x² = (1/2) m ω_x² x² → ω_x² = (4k)/m → ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m). So the energy for x is (n_x + 1/2) ħ * 2 sqrt(k/m).

Similarly, the y-direction potential is (1/2)k y², so k_y = k. So ω_y = sqrt(k/m), and the energy for y is (n_y +1/2) ħ sqrt(k/m).

So the total energy E would be E = (2n_x +1 + 0) * (ħ sqrt(k/m)) [Wait, no: wait, the x part is (n_x + 1/2) * 2 ħ sqrt(k/m) and the y part is (n_y + 1/2) * ħ sqrt(k/m).]

Let me write that out:

E = [ (n_x + 1/2) * 2 ħ sqrt(k/m) ) ] + [ (n_y + 1/2) * ħ sqrt(k/m) ) ]

Factor out ħ sqrt(k/m):

E = ħ sqrt(k/m) [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ) ]

Simplify the terms inside:

= ħ sqrt(k/m) [ 2n_x +1 +n_y + 1/2 ]

Which is:

= ħ sqrt(k/m) [ 2n_x +n_y + 3/2 ]

Wait, let me check the algebra:

2(n_x + 1/2) = 2n_x +1

(n_y + 1/2) = n_y + 0.5

Adding them: 2n_x +1 +n_y +0.5 = 2n_x +n_y + (1 +0.5) = 2n_x +n_y +1.5 = 2n_x +n_y +3/2.

Yes, that's right.

So the energy expression is E = (2n_x +n_y + 3/2) ħ sqrt(k/m).

Looking at the options, option C is E = (2n_x +n_y +3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m). That matches.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in how I transformed the potential. The original potential in polar was (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. When I expressed cos²θ as x²/r², it became (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k x². Expanding r² =x² + y², so (1/2)k x² + (1/2)k y² + (3/2)k x² = (1/2 +3/2)k x² + (1/2 k) y² → 2k x² + (1/2)k y². That's correct.

So the x-direction has a spring constant of 4k (since 2k x² = (1/2) m ω² x² → ω² = (4k)/m, so ω=2√(k/m)).

So the energy from x is (n_x +1/2) ħ ω_x = (n_x +1/2) ħ (2√(k/m)) = 2(n_x +1/2) ħ sqrt(k/m).

Similarly, y has ω_y = sqrt(k/m), so energy is (n_y +1/2) ħ sqrt(k/m).

Adding them: 2(n_x +1/2) + (n_y +1/2) = 2n_x +1 + n_y + 1/2 = 2n_x +n_y + 3/2.

Multiply by ħ sqrt(k/m), which gives E = (2n_x +n_y +3/2) ħ sqrt(k/m), which is option C.

The problem involves a quantum mechanical particle of mass \( m \) moving in a two-dimensional potential \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cos^2(\theta) \). The goal is to determine the energy spectrum from the given options.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Potential Transformation**:  
   The potential can be rewritten in Cartesian coordinates by expressing \( \cos^2(\theta) \) as \( x^2/r^2 \). Substituting \( r^2 = x^2 + y^2 \), the potential becomes:  
   \[
   V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2.
   \]  
   This represents a two-dimensional anharmonic oscillator with different spring constants in the \( x \)- and \( y \)-directions.

2. **Energy Contributions**:  
   - For the \( x \)-direction, the potential is \( 2kx^2 \), which corresponds to a harmonic oscillator with angular frequency \( \omega_x = 2\sqrt{k/m} \). The energy contribution is:  
     \[
     E_x = (n_x + \frac{1}{2})\hbar \omega_x = (n_x + \frac{1}{2})\hbar \cdot 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} = 2(n_x + \frac{1}{2})\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
     \]
   - For the \( y \)-direction, the potential is \( \frac{1}{2}ky^2 \), which corresponds to a harmonic oscillator with angular frequency \( \omega_y = \sqrt{k/m} \). The energy contribution is:  
     \[
     E_y = (n_y + \frac{1}{2})\hbar \omega_y = (n_y + \frac{1}{2})\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
     \]

3. **Total Energy**:  
   The total energy is the sum of the contributions from the \( x \)- and \( y \)-directions:  
   \[
   E = E_x + E_y = 2(n_x + \frac{1}{2})\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} + (n_y + \frac{1}{2})\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
   \]  
   Factoring out \( \hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \), we get:  
   \[
   E = \hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left( 2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2} \right).
   \]

4. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The derived energy expression matches **Option C**:  
   \[
   E = (2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2})\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
   \]

### Final Answer:
The energy spectrum is given by **Option C**.

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of all these concepts. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that a quantum mechanical particle of mass m is moving in two dimensions in a potential V(r, θ) given by ½ kr² + (3/2) kr² cos²(θ). I need to find the energy spectrum from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the Hamiltonian of a system is important because the energy eigenvalues come from solving the Schrödinger equation. So the potential here is r-dependent and also has a θ-dependent term multiplied by r². 

Wait, the potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2) k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let me think about this. I've heard of potentials like the harmonic oscillator. This looks a bit like a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator, but with an additional term involving cos²θ. 

In polar coordinates, the Hamiltonian for a particle in a central potential (which depends only on r) would be H = (p_r²)/(2m) + (p_θ²)/(2m r²) + V(r). But wait, our V here isn't just a function of r; it has a cos²θ term. That complicates things because it introduces angular dependence.

Oh, wait a second. The potential can be written as V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let's factor that. Let me see, 1/2 kr² is like a standard harmonic oscillator term, and the second part is (3/2) kr² cos²θ. Hmm, maybe I can rewrite this in terms of sin² and cos² to see if it separates into radial and angular parts.

Wait, cos²θ can be written using the double-angle identity. Remember that cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So substituting that in, the potential becomes:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² * (1 + cos2θ)/2.

Let me compute that. (3/2)k r² times 1/2 is (3/4)k r², and (3/2)k r² times cos2θ/2 is (3/4)k r² cos2θ. So putting it all together:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ.

Wait, 1/2 plus 3/4 is 5/4. So V(r,θ) = (5/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ. Hmm, interesting. But how does that help me? Maybe I can think about the symmetry of the system.

Alternatively, perhaps a coordinate transformation or change of variables would help. I'm thinking that the presence of cos2θ suggests some kind of angular momentum term or anharmonic potential. Or maybe the potential can be expressed in terms that separate the radial and angular parts.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian in polar coordinates is:

H = (-ħ²/(2m))(1/r ∂/∂r (r ∂/∂r) ) + (-ħ²/(2m r²)) (∂²/∂θ²) ) + V(r,θ).

But with the potential V(r,θ) having that cos2θ term, this could mix the angular and radial parts, which complicates things. Unless the potential can be expressed in a way that allows the Hamiltonian to separate into radial and angular parts.

Wait, another thought: perhaps using the quantum numbers nx and ny. Wait, no, in two dimensions, sometimes problems are separable in Cartesian coordinates. Wait, but the potential is in polar coordinates. Alternatively, maybe the potential can be rewritten in terms of Cartesian coordinates to make it separable.

Wait, cos²θ can be expressed in terms of x and y. Because in polar coordinates, x = r cosθ and y = r sinθ. So cosθ = x/r, so cos²θ = x²/(r²). So the potential V(r,θ) can be written as:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² (x² / r²) ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k x².

But wait, that's an interesting observation. So V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k x². Let me expand r²: r² = x² + y². So substituting that in:

V = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x².

Let me compute that. (1/2)k x² + (1/2)k y² + (3/2)k x² = [ (1/2 + 3/2) k x² ] + (1/2)k y².

Which simplifies to 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Wait, that's not right. Let me compute 1/2 + 3/2: that's 2. So V = 2 k x² + (1/2)k y².

Hmm, so the potential in Cartesian coordinates is V(x,y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y². So this is a two-dimensional anharmonic oscillator, but with different coefficients for x and y.

Wait, but in Cartesian coordinates, the Hamiltonian would be H = p_x²/(2m) + p_y²/(2m) + 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Wait, why? Because the original potential was in polar, but after transformation, it's expressed in terms of x and y. So in this form, each direction (x and y) has its own harmonic oscillator potential but with different frequencies.

In a harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are quantized as E = (n_x + 1/2 ) ħω_x, where ω_x is the angular frequency for that direction. Similarly for y.

But in this case, the potential is quadratic in x and y, so each direction is a harmonic oscillator with their own frequencies. So the total energy would be the sum of the energies in x and y.

So, for the x direction, the potential is 2k x². The standard harmonic oscillator potential is (1/2) m ω² x². So comparing, 2k x² = (1/2) m ω_x² x² → ω_x² = (4k)/m → ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m). So the energy for x would be (n_x + 1/2) ħ ω_x = (n_x + 1/2) ħ * 2 sqrt(k/m) = (2n_x +1) ħ sqrt(k/m) * (1/2) * 2? Wait, no, let me compute it correctly.

Wait, the standard HO energy for x is (n_x + 1/2) ħ ω_x, where ω_x = sqrt(k_x/m), with k_x being the spring constant for that direction. In this case, for x, the potential is 2k x², which would imply that k_x = 4k? Because 2k x² = (1/2) m ω_x² x² → ω_x² = (4k)/m → ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m). So the energy for x is (n_x + 1/2) ħ * 2 sqrt(k/m).

Similarly, the y-direction potential is (1/2)k y², so k_y = k. So ω_y = sqrt(k/m), and the energy for y is (n_y +1/2) ħ sqrt(k/m).

So the total energy E would be E = (2n_x +1 + 0) * (ħ sqrt(k/m)) [Wait, no: wait, the x part is (n_x + 1/2) * 2 ħ sqrt(k/m) and the y part is (n_y + 1/2) * ħ sqrt(k/m).]

Let me write that out:

E = [ (n_x + 1/2) * 2 ħ sqrt(k/m) ) ] + [ (n_y + 1/2) * ħ sqrt(k/m) ) ]

Factor out ħ sqrt(k/m):

E = ħ sqrt(k/m) [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ) ]

Simplify the terms inside:

= ħ sqrt(k/m) [ 2n_x +1 +n_y + 1/2 ]

Which is:

= ħ sqrt(k/m) [ 2n_x +n_y + 3/2 ]

Wait, let me check the algebra:

2(n_x + 1/2) = 2n_x +1

(n_y + 1/2) = n_y + 0.5

Adding them: 2n_x +1 +n_y +0.5 = 2n_x +n_y + (1 +0.5) = 2n_x +n_y +1.5 = 2n_x +n_y +3/2.

Yes, that's right.

So the energy expression is E = (2n_x +n_y + 3/2) ħ sqrt(k/m).

Looking at the options, option C is E = (2n_x +n_y +3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m). That matches.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in how I transformed the potential. The original potential in polar was (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. When I expressed cos²θ as x²/r², it became (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k x². Expanding r² =x² + y², so (1/2)k x² + (1/2)k y² + (3/2)k x² = (1/2 +3/2)k x² + (1/2 k) y² → 2k x² + (1/2)k y². That's correct.

So the x-direction has a spring constant of 4k (since 2k x² = (1/2) m ω² x² → ω² = (4k)/m, so ω=2√(k/m)).

So the energy from x is (n_x +1/2) ħ ω_x = (n_x +1/2) ħ (2√(k/m)) = 2(n_x +1/2) ħ sqrt(k/m).

Similarly, y has ω_y = sqrt(k/m), so energy is (n_y +1/2) ħ sqrt(k/m).

Adding them: 2(n_x +1/2) + (n_y +1/2) = 2n_x +1 + n_y + 1/2 = 2n_x +n_y + 3/2.

Multiply by ħ sqrt(k/m), which gives E = (2n_x +n_y +3/2) ħ sqrt(k/m), which is option C.


The problem involves a quantum mechanical particle of mass \( m \) moving in a two-dimensional potential \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cos^2(\theta) \). The goal is to determine the energy spectrum from the given options.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Potential Transformation**:  
   The potential can be rewritten in Cartesian coordinates by expressing \( \cos^2(\theta) \) as \( x^2/r^2 \). Substituting \( r^2 = x^2 + y^2 \), the potential becomes:  
   \[
   V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2.
   \]  
   This represents a two-dimensional anharmonic oscillator with different spring constants in the \( x \)- and \( y \)-directions.

2. **Energy Contributions**:  
   - For the \( x \)-direction, the potential is \( 2kx^2 \), which corresponds to a harmonic oscillator with angular frequency \( \omega_x = 2\sqrt{k/m} \). The energy contribution is:  
     \[
     E_x = (n_x + \frac{1}{2})\hbar \omega_x = (n_x + \frac{1}{2})\hbar \cdot 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} = 2(n_x + \frac{1}{2})\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
     \]
   - For the \( y \)-direction, the potential is \( \frac{1}{2}ky^2 \), which corresponds to a harmonic oscillator with angular frequency \( \omega_y = \sqrt{k/m} \). The energy contribution is:  
     \[
     E_y = (n_y + \frac{1}{2})\hbar \omega_y = (n_y + \frac{1}{2})\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
     \]

3. **Total Energy**:  
   The total energy is the sum of the contributions from the \( x \)- and \( y \)-directions:  
   \[
   E = E_x + E_y = 2(n_x + \frac{1}{2})\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} + (n_y + \frac{1}{2})\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
   \]  
   Factoring out \( \hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \), we get:  
   \[
   E = \hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left( 2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2} \right).
   \]

4. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The derived energy expression matches **Option C**:  
   \[
   E = (2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2})\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
   \]

### Final Answer:
The energy spectrum is given by **Option C**.  
Answer: C
