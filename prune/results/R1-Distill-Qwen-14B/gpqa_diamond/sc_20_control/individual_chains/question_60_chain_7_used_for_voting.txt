Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. So, there's this civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud, and they have a super fast spacecraft that can go at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The question is about how long it takes for their astronaut to reach Earth, but from the astronaut's perspective.

Wait, the astronaut is 22 years old, and the average lifetime is 150 solar years. Hmm, but the options suggest possible death or other times. So I think this is a time dilation problem from special relativity.

Right, time dilation occurs when an object is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light. The faster you go, the more time slows down for you relative to a stationary observer. But from the astronaut's point of view, their own time is the proper time, and Earth's time is dilated.

Wait, but wait. The question asks how long it takes from the astronaut's perspective. So we're looking for the proper time experienced by the astronaut, which is the time measured in their own frame of reference.

So first, I need to calculate the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. Wait, wait, do I know that? I think the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 163,000 light-years away from Earth. Yeah, that's a figure I remember.

So the distance is approximately 163,000 light-years. The spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987c. Let me calculate the time it takes from Earth's frame of reference.

Time equals distance divided by speed. So 163,000 light-years divided by 0.99999987c. Since one light-year is the distance light travels in a year, the time in Earth's frame is roughly 163,000 / 0.99999987 years.

Wait, 0.99999987 is almost 1, so dividing by that is almost like multiplying by 1. Let me compute that. Let's see, 163,000 / 0.99999987 is approximately 163,000 * (1 / 0.99999987) ≈ 163,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ 163,000 + (163,000 * 0.00000013). Let's compute 0.00000013 * 163,000 = approximately 0.02119. So the time is about 163,001.021 years from Earth's perspective.

But that's a huge time, way longer than the astronaut's 150-year lifespan. So from Earth's frame, the astronaut would never make it. But wait, from the astronaut's frame, time is different due to time dilation.

Ah, right. The astronaut's experienced time is the proper time, which is shorter than the Earth's frame time. So the proper time τ is given by the Lorentz factor gamma multiplied by the Earth time. Wait no, wait. The proper time is actually the Earth time divided by gamma, because the Earth frame is the one with the longer time.

Wait, wait another thing. The Lorentz factor gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me calculate that for v ≈ 0.99999987c. Let's compute v²/c². (0.99999987)^2 is approximately (1 - 1.3e-6)^2. Let me compute it.

(0.99999987)² = (1 - 1.23e-6) approximately. Wait, 0.99999987 is 1 - 0.00000013, so v squared is (1 - 0.00000013)^2 = 1 - 2*0.00000013 + (0.00000013)^2 ≈ 0.99999974 approximately.

So 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026. So gamma is 1 / sqrt(0.00000026). Let's compute sqrt(0.00000026). The square root of 2.6e-7 is approximately sqrt(2.6)*1e-3.5. Wait, sqrt(2.6) is about 1.612, and 1e-3.5 is about 3.16e-4. So 1.612 * 3.16e-4 ≈ 5.08e-4. So gamma ≈ 1 / 5.08e-4 ≈ 1968. So gamma is approximately 1968.

Wait, that's a huge gamma factor. So from Earth's perspective, the trip takes about 163,000 years, but the astronaut's own time is much shorter.

Wait, no. Wait, the proper time τ is calculated as τ = T * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Because proper time is the shortest time experienced by the traveler.

Alternatively, using the formula tau = T_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So T_earth is the time from Earth's frame, which we calculated as about 163,000 years.

So tau = 163000 * sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2). Let me compute 1 - (v^2/c^2). As earlier, that's 0.00000026. So sqrt(0.00000026) is approximately 0.0005099.

So tau ≈ 163000 * 0.0005099 ≈ 163000 * 5.1e-4.

Hmm, 163000 * 5e-4 is 81.5. So approximately 81.5 years. So the astronaut would experience about 81 years of their own time.

Wait, but the astronaut is 22 years old. So 22 + 81 is 103 years. Their average lifetime is 150 years, so they should live long enough.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. Because 0.99999987 is so close to c, gamma is indeed very large, but the proper time is much shorter.

Wait, let's compute gamma again to make sure. If v = 0.99999987c, then beta is v/c = 0.99999987. So beta squared is (0.99999987)^2. Let me compute that more precisely.

0.99999987 * 0.99999987. Let's compute it:

(1 - 1.23e-6)^2 = 1 - 2*(1.23e-6) + (1.23e-6)^2. So 1 - 2.46e-6 + (1.5129e-12) ≈ approximately 0.9999997554.

So 1 - beta squared is 1 - 0.9999997554 = 0.0000002446.

So sqrt(1 - beta^2) is sqrt(2.446e-7).

What's sqrt(2.446e-7)? Let's compute that. 2.446e-7 is 2.446 * 1e-7. The square root of 2.446 is about 1.564, and the square root of 1e-7 is 1e-3.5 ≈ 3.162e-4.

So sqrt(2.446e-7) ≈ 1.564 * 3.162e-4 ≈ approximately 0.0004953.

So tau is T_earth * 0.0004953.

T_earth is 163000 years. So 163000 * 0.0004953 = ?

Let's compute 163000 * 0.0004953:

First, 163000 * 0.0004 = 163000 * 4e-4 = 163000 * 0.0004 = 65.2.

Then, 163000 * 0.0000953. Let's compute 0.0000953 = 9.53e-5.

163000 * 9.53e-5 = 163000 * 0.0000953.

Compute 163000 * 953e-8.

163000 * 953 = Let's compute 163 * 953, then add four zeros.

163 * 953. Let me compute:

163 * 900 = 146,700.

163 * 50 =8,150.

163 *3=489.

So sum: 146700 +8150=154,850 +489=155,339.

So 163000 * 953e-8 = 155,339 * 1e-3 = 155.339.

So total tau is approximately 65.2 + 155.339 ≈ 220.539 years.

Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier calculation. What's wrong here?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the computation. Let's go step by step.

Wait, T_earth is 163,000 years. Tau is T_earth multiplied by sqrt(1 - beta^2), which we calculated as approximately 0.0004953.

So 163000 * 0.0004953 = ?

Let me compute this as 163000 * 0.0004 = 65.2, and 163000 * 0.0000953 = ?

Wait, 0.0000953 is 9.53e-5. 163000 * 9.53e-5 = (163000 * 9.53) * 1e-5.

163000 * 9.53 = Let's compute 163 * 9.53 = ?

163 *9=1467, 163 *0.53=86.39. So total 1467 +86.39=1553.39.

So 163000 *9.53=1553.39 *1000 =1,553,390.

Multiply by 1e-5: 1,553,390 * 1e-5 = 15.5339.

So 163000 *0.0000953 = approx 15.5339.

So total tau is 65.2 +15.5339 ≈80.7339 years.

Ah, okay, that's around 80.73 years. So about 81 years.

So the astronaut would experience approximately 81 years of their own time. So they are 22 now, and with 81 years, they would be 103, which is within their 150-year lifespan. So they would live long enough.

So among the options, the answer would be option C) 81 years.

But wait, looking back, the options are A) die, B)72, C)81, D)77.

So the correct answer is C)81.

But why did I get confused earlier? Oh wait, because I thought perhaps the gamma factor was leading me to miscalculate. But with the proper time calculation, it's correct.

Wait another thing, perhaps the distance is different. I thought the LMC is about 163,000 light-years away. Let me confirm.

Yes, the Large Magellanic Cloud is approximately 163,000 light-years from Earth. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach is to compute the distance as observed by the astronaut.

Wait, in special relativity, length contraction happens in the direction of motion. So the distance as observed by the astronaut would be Lorentz-contracted.

So from Earth's frame, the distance is D = 163,000 ly.

In the astronaut's frame, moving at velocity v, the distance is D' = D * sqrt(1 - beta^2).

So D' = 163,000 * sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2) ≈ 163,000 * 0.0004953 ≈ 80.73 light-years.

So the time experienced by the astronaut is D' / v = (80.73 ly) / (0.99999987c).

Since 1 ly is the distance light travels in a year, time is (80.73 / 0.99999987) years ≈80.73 years.

So that's the same as before. So yes, about 81 years.

Thus, the astronaut would experience about 81 years, which is option C. So the correct answer is C.

To determine how long it will take for the astronaut to reach Earth from their perspective, we analyze the problem using special relativity, specifically time dilation and length contraction.

### Key Information:
1. **Distance to Earth**: The Large Magellanic Cloud is approximately 163,000 light-years away from Earth.
2. **Spacecraft Speed**: \( v = 0.99999987c \), where \( c \) is the speed of light.
3. **Astronaut's Perspective**: The proper time (\( \tau \)) experienced by the astronaut is shorter than the time measured in Earth's frame due to time dilation.

### Step 1: Time Dilation
The proper time (\( \tau \)) experienced by the astronaut is related to the time in Earth's frame (\( T_{\text{Earth}} \)) by the Lorentz factor (\( \gamma \)):

\[
\tau = T_{\text{Earth}} \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
\]

First, calculate \( \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \):
- \( v^2/c^2 = (0.99999987)^2 \approx 0.99999974 \)
- \( 1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} \approx 0.00000026 \)
- \( \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \approx \sqrt{0.00000026} \approx 0.0005099 \)

Next, calculate \( T_{\text{Earth}} \), the time it takes to travel 163,000 light-years at \( v = 0.99999987c \):
\[
T_{\text{Earth}} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{v} = \frac{163,000 \, \text{ly}}{0.99999987} \approx 163,000 \, \text{years}
\]

Now, calculate \( \tau \):
\[
\tau = T_{\text{Earth}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \approx 163,000 \cdot 0.0005099 \approx 82.1 \, \text{years}
\]

### Step 2: Verification Using Length Contraction
From the astronaut's frame, the distance to Earth is Lorentz-contracted:
\[
D' = D \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \approx 163,000 \cdot 0.0005099 \approx 82.1 \, \text{light-years}
\]

The time experienced by the astronaut is:
\[
\tau = \frac{D'}{v} = \frac{82.1 \, \text{ly}}{0.99999987} \approx 82.1 \, \text{years}
\]

### Conclusion:
The astronaut will experience approximately 81 years of their own time during the journey. Since their average lifetime is 150 years, they will live long enough to reach Earth.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A)** Incorrect. The astronaut will not die before reaching Earth.
- **B)** Incorrect. The time is longer than 72 years.
- **C)** Correct. The astronaut will experience approximately 81 years.
- **D)** Incorrect. The time is longer than 77 years.

Answer: C

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. So, there's this civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud, and they have a super fast spacecraft that can go at 0.99999987 times the speed of light.

So first, I need to calculate the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. Wait, wait, do I know that? I think the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 163,000 light-years away from Earth. Yeah, that's a figure I remember.

So the distance is approximately 163,000 light-years. The spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987c. Let me calculate the time it takes from Earth's frame of reference.

Time equals distance divided by speed. So 163,000 light-years divided by 0.99999987c. Since one light-year is the distance light travels in a year, the time in Earth's frame is roughly 163,000 / 0.99999987 years.

Wait, 0.99999987 is almost 1, so dividing by that is almost like multiplying by 1. Let me compute that. Let's see, 163,000 / 0.99999987 is approximately 163,000 * (1 / 0.99999987) ≈ 163,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ 163,000 + (163,000 * 0.00000013). Let's compute 0.00000013 * 163,000 = approximately 0.02119. So the time is about 163,001.021 years from Earth's perspective.

But that's a huge time, way longer than the astronaut's 150-year lifespan. So from Earth's frame, the astronaut would never make it. But wait, from the astronaut's frame, time is different due to time dilation.

Ah, right. The astronaut's experienced time is the proper time, which is shorter than the Earth's frame time. So the proper time τ is given by the Lorentz factor gamma multiplied by the Earth time. Wait no, wait. The proper time is actually the Earth time divided by gamma, because the Earth frame is the one with the longer time.

Wait, wait another thing. The Lorentz factor gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me calculate that for v ≈ 0.99999987c. Let's compute v²/c². (0.99999987)^2 is approximately (1 - 1.3e-6)^2. Let me compute it.

(0.99999987)² = (1 - 1.23e-6) approximately. Wait, 0.99999987 is 1 - 0.00000013, so v squared is (1 - 0.00000013)^2 = 1 - 2*0.00000013 + (0.00000013)^2 ≈ 0.99999974 approximately.

So 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026. So gamma is 1 / sqrt(0.00000026). Let's compute sqrt(0.00000026). The square root of 2.6e-7 is approximately sqrt(2.6)*1e-3.5. Wait, sqrt(2.6) is about 1.612, and 1e-3.5 is about 3.16e-4. So 1.612 * 3.16e-4 ≈ 5.08e-4. So gamma ≈ 1 / 5.08e-4 ≈ 1968. So gamma is approximately 1968.

Wait, that's a huge gamma factor. So from Earth's perspective, the trip takes about 163,000 years, but the astronaut's own time is much shorter.

Wait, no. Wait, the proper time τ is calculated as τ = T * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Because proper time is the shortest time experienced by the traveler.

Alternatively, using the formula tau = T_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So T_earth is the time from Earth's frame, which we calculated as about 163,000 years.

So tau = 163000 * sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2). Let me compute 1 - (v^2/c^2). As earlier, that's 0.00000026. So sqrt(0.00000026) is approximately 0.0005099.

So tau ≈ 163000 * 0.0005099 ≈ 163000 * 5.1e-4.

Hmm, 163000 * 5e-4 is 81.5. So approximately 81.5 years. So the astronaut would experience about 81 years of their own time.

Wait, but the astronaut is 22 years old. So 22 + 81 is 103 years. Their average lifetime is 150 years, so they should live long enough.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. Because 0.99999987 is so close to c, gamma is indeed very large, but the proper time is much shorter.

Wait, let's compute gamma again to make sure. If v = 0.99999987c, then beta is v/c = 0.99999987. So beta squared is (0.99999987)^2. Let me compute that more precisely.

0.99999987 * 0.99999987. Let's compute it:

(1 - 1.23e-6)^2 = 1 - 2*(1.23e-6) + (1.23e-6)^2. So 1 - 2.46e-6 + (1.5129e-12) ≈ approximately 0.9999997554.

So 1 - beta squared is 1 - 0.9999997554 = 0.0000002446.

So sqrt(1 - beta^2) is sqrt(2.446e-7).

What's sqrt(2.446e-7)? Let's compute that. 2.446e-7 is 2.446 * 1e-7. The square root of 2.446 is about 1.564, and the square root of 1e-7 is 1e-3.5 ≈ 3.162e-4.

So sqrt(2.446e-7) ≈ 1.564 * 3.162e-4 ≈ approximately 0.0004953.

So tau is T_earth * 0.0004953.

T_earth is 163000 years. So 163000 * 0.0004953 = ?

Let's compute 163000 * 0.0004953:

First, 163000 * 0.0004 = 163000 * 4e-4 = 163000 * 0.0004 = 65.2.

Then, 163000 * 0.0000953. Let's compute 0.0000953 = 9.53e-5.

163000 * 9.53e-5 = 163000 * 0.0000953.

Compute 163000 * 953e-8.

163000 * 953 = Let's compute 163 * 953, then add four zeros.

163 * 953. Let me compute:

163 * 900 = 146,700.

163 * 50 =8,150.

163 *3=489.

So sum: 146700 +8150=154,850 +489=155,339.

So 163000 * 953e-8 = 155,339 * 1e-3 = 155.339.

So total tau is approximately 65.2 + 155.339 ≈ 220.539 years.

Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier calculation. What's wrong here?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the computation. Let's go step by step.

Wait, T_earth is 163,000 years. Tau is T_earth multiplied by sqrt(1 - beta^2), which we calculated as approximately 0.0004953.

So 163000 * 0.0004953 = ?

Let me compute this as 163000 * 0.0004 = 65.2, and 163000 * 0.0000953 = ?

Wait, 0.0000953 is 9.53e-5. 163000 * 9.53e-5 = (163000 * 9.53) * 1e-5.

163000 * 9.53 = Let's compute 163 * 9.53 = ?

163 *9=1467, 163 *0.53=86.39. So total 1467 +86.39=1553.39.

So 163000 *9.53=1553.39 *1000 =1,553,390.

Multiply by 1e-5: 1,553,390 * 1e-5 = 15.5339.

So 163000 *0.0000953 = approx 15.5339.

So total tau is 65.2 +15.5339 ≈80.7339 years.

Ah, okay, that's around 80.73 years. So about 81 years.

So the astronaut would experience approximately 81 years of their own time. So they are 22 now, and with 81 years, they would be 103, which is within their 150-year lifespan. So they would live long enough.

So among the options, the answer would be option C) 81 years.

But wait, looking back, the options are A) die, B)72, C)81, D)77.

So the correct answer is C)81.

But why did I get confused earlier? Oh wait, because I thought perhaps the gamma factor was leading me to miscalculate. But with the proper time calculation, it's correct.

Wait another thing, perhaps the distance is different. I thought the LMC is about 163,000 light-years away. Let me confirm.

Yes, the Large Magellanic Cloud is approximately 163,000 light-years from Earth. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach is to compute the distance as observed by the astronaut.

Wait, in special relativity, length contraction happens in the direction of motion. So the distance as observed by the astronaut would be Lorentz-contracted.

So from Earth's frame, the distance is D = 163,000 ly.

In the astronaut's frame, moving at velocity v, the distance is D' = D * sqrt(1 - beta^2).

So D' = 163,000 * sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2) ≈ 163,000 * 0.0004953 ≈ 80.73 light-years.

So the time experienced by the astronaut is D' / v = (80.73 ly) / (0.99999987c).

Since 1 ly is the distance light travels in a year, time is (80.73 / 0.99999987) years ≈80.73 years.

So that's the same as before. So yes, about 81 years.

Thus, the astronaut would experience about 81 years, which is option C. So the correct answer is C.


To determine how long it will take for the astronaut to reach Earth from their perspective, we analyze the problem using special relativity, specifically time dilation and length contraction.

\[

First, calculate \( \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \):
- \( v^2/c^2 = (0.99999987)^2 \approx 0.99999974 \)
- \( 1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} \approx 0.00000026 \)
- \( \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \approx \sqrt{0.00000026} \approx 0.0005099 \)

Next, calculate \( T_{\text{Earth}} \), the time it takes to travel 163,000 light-years at \( v = 0.99999987c \):
\[
T_{\text{Earth}} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{v} = \frac{163,000 \, \text{ly}}{0.99999987} \approx 163,000 \, \text{years}
\]

Now, calculate \( \tau \):
\[
\tau = T_{\text{Earth}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \approx 163,000 \cdot 0.0005099 \approx 82.1 \, \text{years}
\]

### Step 2: Verification Using Length Contraction
From the astronaut's frame, the distance to Earth is Lorentz-contracted:
\[
D' = D \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \approx 163,000 \cdot 0.0005099 \approx 82.1 \, \text{light-years}
\]

The time experienced by the astronaut is:
\[
\tau = \frac{D'}{v} = \frac{82.1 \, \text{ly}}{0.99999987} \approx 82.1 \, \text{years}
\]

### Conclusion:
The astronaut will experience approximately 81 years of their own time during the journey. Since their average lifetime is 150 years, they will live long enough to reach Earth.
