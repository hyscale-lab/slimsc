Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I remember that stability constants (β) tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more the complex will form.

The question is asking about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. Wait, what's a dithiocyanato complex? Oh right, I think that's [Co(SCN)_2]^n+ or something like that. But wait, the question specifies the blue ones, which I think are the tetrahedral complexes, maybe [Co(SCN)_4]^2-? Or maybe it's the hexadentate one? Wait, let me think. Cobalt can form different complexes with thiocyanate. The problem gives four stability constants: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So each β corresponds to a different complex.

Wait, the general formula for the stability constant is for the formation of a complex. So [CoL]^n+ would have a β1, [CoL2]^m+ would have β2, etc. So β1 is for the first complex, β2 for the second, up to β4 for the fourth.

But wait, what are the structures for each? I think for Co(II), the complexes might be:

- β1: [Co(SCN)]^+
- β2: [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (maybe neutral)
- β3: [Co(SCN)_3]^-
- β4: [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the complexes are [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n}, where n is the number of SCN ligands. Let me think: for each step, adding a SCN- ion.

But wait, in any case, the problem is to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Wait, dithiocyanato would mean two SCN ligands. So the complex would be [Co(SCN)_2]^something. But the question says dithiocyanato, so perhaps the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ complex? Or another charge?

Wait, the blue color is associated with the tetrahedral complexes, right? Like [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} is the blue one, which is a tetrahedral structure. Oh wait, no, wait. I'm getting a bit confused. Let me check my notes. Oh right, the [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} is the blue complex, which is a tetrahedral structure. So that's the fourth complex. But the problem says "dithiocyanato" which implies two SCN- groups. Hmm, so maybe I'm getting mixed up here.

Wait, dithiocyanato would be two SCN ligands. So that would be the second complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^something. So the blue complex is the tetrahedral one, which is the fourth? Or maybe it's the third. Hmm, perhaps I should focus on the formula regardless of color.

Wait, the problem is asking for the percentage of blue dithiocyanato complexes. So maybe the blue one refers to the [Co(SCN)_2]^something, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's proceed with the data given.

The solution has c(Co) = 1e-2 M. That's the total cobalt concentration. The thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

So the general approach is to find the fraction of each complex, then sum the fractions of the desired complexes (blue dithiocyanato) to get the percentage.

Wait, but the problem says "dithiocyanato" which is two SCN- groups. So that would be the second complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^something. But if the beta values are given as β1 to β4, each for each step, then β2 would correspond to [Co(SCN)_2]^n+.

But wait, the stability constants are cumulative. So β1 is the formation constant for [CoL]^+, β2 is for [CoL]_2^something, considering the step-wise addition.

Wait, the step-wise formation constants are for each additional ligand. So the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n]^{charge} is the product of the step-wise constants up to n. Wait, no. Wait, the step-wise constant βn is the constant for the nth ionization. So for example, the formation of [CoSCN]^+ from Co^2+ and SCN^- would have β1, then the formation of [CoSCN2]^{n} would involve β2, etc.

Wait, no, wait. Let me make it clear. The formation of the first complex, [CoL]^+, is given by:

Co^2+ + L^- ↔ [CoL]^+ ; β1 = [ [CoL]^+ ] / ( [Co^2+][L^-] )

The formation of the second complex would then be:

[CoL]^+ + L^- ↔ [CoL2]^{0} ; β2 = [ [CoL2]^0 ] / ( [CoL^+][L^-] )

So the overall formation constant for [CoL2]^0 would be β1 * β2.

Similarly, for [CoL3]^-, it's β1 * β2 * β3.

And for [CoL4]^{2-}, β1*β2*β3*β4.

Wait, but β4 is 16. So that's the fourth step.

So each β corresponds to adding another SCN-.

Therefore, the overall formation constants for each complex are:

β_total_1 = β1 = 9

β_total_2 = β1 * β2 = 9 *40 = 360

β_total_3 = β1 β2 β3 = 9 *40 *63 = let's see, 9*40=360, 360*63=22680.

β_total_4 = β1 β2 β3 β4 = 22680 *16 = 362880.

Wait, but the problem says the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So each β is the step-wise constant.

So to find the fraction of each complex, we can model the distribution using the log of the formation constants and the concentrations.

Alternatively, the fraction of each species can be determined using the formula:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn) [SCN^-]^n / (1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β1 β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN^-]^3 + ... )

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it's the sum of each possible complex. So the total concentration of all Co species is the sum of [Co], [CoL], [CoL2], [CoL3], [CoL4], etc. But wait, the initial Co is Co^2+, and the complexes are [CoL], [CoL2], etc.

Wait, but the total cobalt concentration is the sum of all the species: [Co^2+] + [CoL]^+ + [CoL2]^0 + [CoL3]^- + [CoL4]^{2-} = c(Co) = 1e-2 M.

But since the solution is aqueous and neutral, perhaps the charge balance must be considered, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe we can ignore activity coefficients and proceed with the given concentrations.

The approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex, which is given by:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN^-]^n) / D,

where D is the denominator: 1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β1 β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN^-]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN^-]^4.

Wait, but wait, each β is the step-wise constant. So the total formation constant for n ligands is the product of β1 to βn.

So the fraction for the nth complex is (β_total_n [SCN^-]^n ) / D.

So, in this case, D would be the sum of all possible β_total_i [SCN^-]^i, for i=0 to 4.

Wait, but [Co] is Co^2+, which is i=0. So β_total_0 is 1 (since [Co] = 1 when no ligands are bound). So D is 1 + β1 [SCN] + β1β2 [SCN]^2 + β1β2β3 [SCN]^3 + β1β2β3β4 [SCN]^4.

So let me compute the terms.

Given:
[SCN^-] = 0.1 M.

Compute each term:

Term 0: 1

Term 1: β1 * [SCN] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

Term 2: β1 β2 [SCN]^2 = 9*40 * (0.1)^2 = 360 * 0.01 = 3.6

Term 3: β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 = 9*40*63 * (0.1)^3 = (22680) * 0.001 = 22.68

Term 4: β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4 = 9*40*63*16 * (0.1)^4.

Compute 9*40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680 *16= 362880. [SCN]^4 is (0.1)^4= 0.0001.

So term4 = 362880 * 0.0001 = 36.288.

So D = 1 + 0.9 + 3.6 + 22.68 + 36.288.

Compute 1+0.9=1.9; 1.9+3.6=5.5; 5.5+22.68=28.18; 28.18+36.288=64.468.

So D=64.468.

Now, the fractions for each species:

f_0 = 1 / D = 1/64.468 ≈ 0.01551 or 1.551%

f_1 = (β1 [SCN}) / D = 0.9 /64.468 ≈ 0.01396 or 1.396%

f_2 = [β1 β2 [SCN]^2 ] / D = 3.6 /64.468 ≈ 0.05557 or 5.557%

f_3 = [β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 ] / D =22.68 /64.468 ≈0.3518 or 35.18%

f_4 = [β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4 ] / D=36.288 /64.468 ≈ 0.5628 or 56.28%.

Wait, but wait, these fractions must sum to 100%, right? Let's check: 1.551 + 1.396 = 2.947; plus 5.557 is 8.504; plus 35.18 is 43.684; plus 56.28 is about 99.964. Hmm, some rounding errors, but close enough.

Now, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. So which complex is that?

Wait, the blue complexes are usually the ones with a higher number of thiocyanate ligands, I think. Or perhaps it's the [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} which is the tetrahedral blue complex.

Wait, but the problem states that it's the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato implies two SCN ligands. So the [Co(SCN)_2] complex, which is the second term (i=2). So the fraction for this species is f_2 ≈5.557%. But looking at the options, the choices are 16.9, 25.6, 38.1, 42.3%. None near 5.5%. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm wrong about which complex is the blue one. Maybe the blue is the tetrahedral, which is the fourth complex, f_4=56.28%. But wait, the question is about dithiocyanato, which is two ligands, not four.

Wait, perhaps I got the term numbering wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the first complex is [Co(SCN)], which is a Co^2+ with one SCN-, so [Co(SCN)]^+.

The second complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is neutral. The third is [Co(SCN)_3]^- and the fourth is [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}.

If the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}, which is the fourth term, then the fraction is 56.28%. But the question is about dithiocyanato, which is two SCN. So that's the second complex.

Hmm, but the options don't have around 5.5%, so perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I confused the step-wise β with the overall β. Or perhaps the question is about the dithiocyanato complex, which is the second one, but maybe the blue color is a different complex. Wait, maybe the blue is the third complex. Let me think.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the problem again.

The question is: What is the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

"Dithiocyanato" implies two SCN ligands. So the complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^n+. So we're looking for the fraction f_2.

Wait, but according to my previous calculation, f_2 is about 5.55%. But the options don't include that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the calculations.

Compute each term:

[SCN] = 0.1 M.

Term 0: 1

Term 1: β1 * [SCN] =9 *0.1= 0.9

Term2: β1*β2 * [SCN]^2=9*40 *0.01=360 *0.01=3.6

Term3: β1β2β3 [SCN]^3=9*40*63 * (0.1)^3=22680 *0.001=22.68

Term4: β1β2β3β4 [SCN]^4=9*40*63*16 *0.0001.

Compute 9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680*16=362880. Then 362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Sum all: 1 +0.9=1.9, +3.6=5.5, +22.68=28.18, +36.288=64.468.

So D=64.468.

f_2=3.6/64.468 ≈0.05557 or 5.557%.

Hmm, that's correct, but the options don't have that.

Wait, maybe the question is about the dithiocyanato (two SCN) but the blue is referring to the hexaaqua ion? No, that's with water.

Alternatively, perhaps I got the complexes wrong. Wait, perhaps the blue is the [Co(SCN)_2]^+ ion, which is the first complex.

Wait, but in that case, f_1 is ~1.4%. No, that's not matching the options either.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the terms. Let me recheck.

Wait, no, the calculations seem correct.

Alternative approach: perhaps the problem is to find the percentage of all dithiocyanato complexes, regardless of charge. But if the question is about the blue ones, perhaps it's a specific one among them.

Wait, maybe the dithiocyanato complex is the [Co(SCN)_2]^−, which would be the third term.

Wait, but according to the way the terms are structured, term 2 is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, term3 is [Co(SCN)_3]^-.

Wait, I'm getting confused about the charges.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem refers to the dithiocyanato as any complex with two SCN ligands, regardless of the overall charge. So the fraction is f_2=5.55% and that's it.

But the options don't have this, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the dithiocyanato complex but the tetra or hexa. Alternatively, maybe the blue is the [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}, which is the fourth complex, which has 4 SCN-, and its fraction is f_4=56.28%.

But the question is about dithiocyanato, which is two SCN. So perhaps the question is a trick and the blue isn't the same as the dithiocyanato.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the denominator.

Wait, maybe I forgot that the initial Co^2+ is part of the denominator. Wait, the denominator in the fraction is the sum of all possible species. So D is correct as 64.468.

Wait, but wait, the problem states that the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M. So, perhaps the approach should be to not assume that D is 64.468, but consider that the sum of all f_i multiplied by c(Co) gives the total.

Wait, no, the fractions f_i are defined as the ratio of each species to the total. So D is the sum of all possible terms, which is the same as the sum of all species' concentrations divided by [Co^2+]?

Wait, perhaps I should model the problem using the formation constants correctly.

Another approach: The formation of each complex can be modeled using the step-wise constants. The fraction of each complex is given by:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN^-]^n) / (1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β1 β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN^-]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN^-]^4)

So the fractions are as I calculated.

So if the problem is about the dithiocyanato complex ([Co(SCN)_2]^0), the fraction is 3.6 /64.468 ≈5.55%.

But none of the options match that. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the blue color, which is associated with the [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} complex. So f_4 =36.288/64.468= approx 56.28%. But again, the options don't have that.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating the denominator. Let me recalculate D.

D = 1 + 0.9 + 3.6 +22.68 +36.288.

Sum step by step:

1 + 0.9 = 1.9

1.9 +3.6 =5.5

5.5 +22.68=28.18

28.18 +36.288=64.468. So that's correct.

Wait, maybe the question is about the dithiocyanato (two SCN) but includes all possible charges. So the fraction is f_2=5.55%, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing the order of the β. Maybe the β4 is for the [Co(SCN)_2] complex, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the formation of the [Co(SCN)_2] complex, but considering that the solution may have more than one possible isomeric form, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the problem is referring to the dithiocyanato complexes as any complexes with two SCN ligands, but that would include [Co(SCN)_2]^+ and [Co(SCN)_2]^0 and [Co(SCN)_2]^-? No, that's not possible because each addition of SCN- increases the charge.

Wait, but the step-wise approach only considers each addition. So the second complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is neutral.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking about the percentage of all [Co(SCN)_2] complexes, regardless of the other possible ligands. But I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} is the same as the dithiocyanato, but that would be four ligands, so not two.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to dithiocyanato as the [Co(SCN)_2] complex, but the blue color is another complex. So maybe the blue is the third complex, [Co(SCN)_3]^-.

So f_3=22.68/64.468≈35.18%. But the options don't have 35%. The closest is option C) 38.1%.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in calculating the terms.

Wait, let me double-check each term:

Term0: 1.

Term1: β1 * [SCN} = 9 *0.1=0.9.

Term2: β1 β2 [SCN]^2 =9*40=360, [SCN]^2=0.01. 360 *0.01=3.6.

Term3: β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3=360 *63=22680, [SCN]^3=0.001, so 22.68.

Term4: 22680 *16=362880. [SCN]^4=0.0001. 362880 *0.0001=36.288.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the sum of the first and second complexes, but that's not what the question says.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing that the [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} is a different structure, perhaps more stable, but I've already included that in the calculation.

In that case, the fraction of [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} is approx 56.28%. If the blue refers to that, then the answer would be about 56%, but that's not an option. So perhaps the question is not about the most stable complex, but about the dithiocyanato.

But the options don't have 5%. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, the problem says "the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes". Maybe dithiocyanato refers to the presence of two SCN ligands, but the blue is the [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} which has four. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the possible complexes and their colors. I remember that [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} is blue and tetrahedral. [Co(SCN)_2]^+ is pink or another color. So the question is asking about the blue complex, which is the fourth complex, so f_4=56.28%.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the terms. Let me see.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the stability constants are given in a different way. Maybe β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^2+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^-, and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}.

Then, the formation constants would be:

β1 =9.

β2=40. So for [CoL2], the formation constant is β1 * β2 =9 *40=360.

β3=63. So [CoL3] has β1β2β3=9*40*63=22680.

β4=16. So [CoL4] has β1β2β3β4=22680*16=362880.

But the [SCN] is 0.1 M.

So the terms are as before.

So D=64.468.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the sum of the first two complexes. But that gives 1.55+1.39=2.94%, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the sum of all complexes with two SCN ligands, but in this case it's only one species, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, so 5.55%.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the possibility of more than four ligands, but the given β4 is 16, which would be for four ligands. So the maximum is four.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the question is actually about the dithiocyanato complexes, which include [Co(SCN)_2]^+ and [Co(SCN)_2]^0. But in this model, the second complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (neutral), and the first is [Co(SCN)]^+.

So the fraction for [Co(SCN)_2] would be f_2=5.55%, but that's not an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the percentage of the dithiocyanato complexes in the solution, but considering that the solution may have other ion pairs or other species. Or perhaps the problem is considering the charge of the complex.

Another angle: perhaps the problem is considering the dithiocyanato complex as including both [Co(SCN)_2]^+ and [Co(SCN)_2]^0, but that's not likely as they are different species.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the question is using a different definition of β. Maybe the β given are the overall formation constants, not the step-wise ones.

In that case, β1 is the formation constant for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^- and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}.

If that's the case, then the fractions would be computed using each β multiplied by [SCN]^n, divided by the sum.

Wait, but then the denominator would be 1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4.

Ah, that's a different approach.

So let me try this.

In this case:

β1 =9 → [CoSCN]^+

β2=40 → [CoSCN2]^0

β3=63 → [CoSCN3]^- 

β4=16 → [CoSCN4]^{2-}

So the denominator D would be:

1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4.

So with [SCN}=0.1 M:

Term0:1

Term1:9 *0.1=0.9

Term2:40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4

Term3:63*(0.1)^3=63 *0.001=0.063

Term4:16*(0.1)^4=16 * 0.0001=0.0016

So D=1 +0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016 = 2.3646.

Then, the fraction for each complex:

f0=1/2.3646 ≈0.4225 →42.25%

f1= (9 *0.1)/2.3646 ≈0.9 /2.3646≈0.381 →38.1%

f2= (40 *0.01)/2.3646≈0.4/2.3646≈0.169 →16.9%

Wait, but wait, according to this, f2 is 16.9%, which is option D.

But the question is about the dithiocyanato complexes, which would be [CoSCN2]^0, so f2=16.9%.

So the percentage would be about 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, why is this different from the previous calculation? Because in this approach, each β is the overall formation constant for that complex, not the step-wise.

Ah, I see. So I think the confusion arises from whether the given β are step-wise or overall.

In the first approach, I assumed step-wise β, and got f2=5.55%, but the options didn't match.

In the second approach, assuming each β is the overall formation constant for the complex with n ligands, the fractions are different.

Which approach is correct?

The problem states that the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, etc. Stability constants are typically given as overall formation constants for the complex with n ligands, not step-wise.

Wait, no. The step-wise (formation) constants are the ones used for each step. The overall constants would be the product of step-wise. So if β1 is the first step-wise, then overall for [CoL] is β1, for [CoL2], it's β1*β2, etc.

So the initial approach I took was correct, assuming step-wise β.

But then the fractions don't match the options, unless the problem is using the overall constants as β.

So let me reevaluate.

If the problem gives β as the overall constants for each n, then the denominator is as in the second approach.

But I'm getting conflicting results, so perhaps I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the dithiocyanato complexes, which are [Co(SCN)_2]^+ and [Co(SCN)_2]^0. But in the step-wise approach, [Co(SCN)_2]^0 has a fraction f_2=5.55%, and [Co(SCN)_2]^+ would be f_1=1.396%. So the sum is about 6.94%, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the dithiocyanato complexes as the sum of all species with two SCN, but perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the blue color, which is associated with [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}, and the percentage is f4=56.28%, but that's not an option.

Wait, looking at the options: option C is 38.1%, which is approximately the f1=38.1% when using the overall β approach.

So perhaps the problem is using the overall β approach, where each β is the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n].

So in that case, D=2.3646.

f1=0.9/2.3646≈0.381, which is 38.1%, option C.

But the question is about dithiocyanato, which is two SCN. So in this model, the dithiocyanato complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is f2=0.4/2.3646≈16.9%, option D.

Wait, but the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complexes. So if the blue is the [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}, which has a fraction f4=0.0016/2.3646≈0.0677, about 6.77%, which isn't an option.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the overall β for each complex, but the dithiocyanato is two SCN, which would be [Co(SCN)_2]^0 with β2=40.

So f2=40*(0.1)^2 / D.

Wait, D=1 +9*0.1 +40*0.01 +63*0.001 +16*0.0001 =1 +0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016=2.3646.

So f2=0.4/2.3646≈0.169 or 16.9%, which is option D.

But the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which would imply f2=16.9%.

But wait, why is [Co(SCN)_2]^0 the blue one? I thought the blue was [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the blue dithiocyanato is a different complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the blue color but about the dithiocyanato, and the blue is a red herring. But that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the percentage of all dithiocyanato complexes (both [Co(SCN)_2]^+ and [Co(SCN)_2]^0). But in that case, f1 +f2=0.381 +0.169=0.55, so 55%, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the sum of all complexes with two SCN, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try the overall approach again.

If the β's are the overall constants for the complexes, then:

The denominator D=2.3646.

The fraction for [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is f2=0.4/2.3646≈16.9%, which is option D.

But the question is about dithiocyanato, which is two SCN ligands. So this would be correct.

But why is the question mentioning blue? Because the blue is a different complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the dithiocyanato (two SCN), but the blue is the same as that.

In that case, the correct answer would be 16.9%, option D.

To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species using the given stability constants and concentrations.

### Key Information:
- **Total cobalt concentration**: \( [\text{Co}] = 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \)
- **Thiocyanate concentration**: \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \)
- **Stability constants**:  
  \( \beta_1 = 9 \), \( \beta_2 = 40 \), \( \beta_3 = 63 \), \( \beta_4 = 16 \)

The stability constants are interpreted as **overall formation constants** for the complexes:
- \( \beta_1 \): \( [\text{Co(SCN)}]^+ \)
- \( \beta_2 \): \( [\text{Co(SCN)}_2]^0 \)
- \( \beta_3 \): \( [\text{Co(SCN)}_3]^- \)
- \( \beta_4 \): \( [\text{Co(SCN)}_4]^{2-} \)

The fraction of each cobalt species is calculated using the formula:

\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n}{D}
\]

where \( D \) is the sum of all possible species:

\[
D = 1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4
\]

### Calculations:
1. **Denominator \( D \):**
   - \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \)
   - \( [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = (0.1)^2 = 0.01 \)
   - \( [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = (0.1)^3 = 0.001 \)
   - \( [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = (0.1)^4 = 0.0001 \)
   - Substituting:
     \[
     D = 1 + (9 \cdot 0.1) + (40 \cdot 0.01) + (63 \cdot 0.001) + (16 \cdot 0.0001)
     \]
     \[
     D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
     \]

2. **Fractions of each species:**
   - \( f_0 = \frac{1}{D} = \frac{1}{2.3646} \approx 0.4225 \, (42.25\%) \)
   - \( f_1 = \frac{\beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-]}{D} = \frac{9 \cdot 0.1}{2.3646} = \frac{0.9}{2.3646} \approx 0.381 \, (38.1\%) \)
   - \( f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2}{D} = \frac{40 \cdot 0.01}{2.3646} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169 \, (16.9\%) \)
   - \( f_3 = \frac{\beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3}{D} = \frac{63 \cdot 0.001}{2.3646} = \frac{0.063}{2.3646} \approx 0.0266 \, (2.66\%) \)
   - \( f_4 = \frac{\beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4}{D} = \frac{16 \cdot 0.0001}{2.3646} = \frac{0.0016}{2.3646} \approx 0.000677 \, (0.0677\%) \)

3. **Blue dithiocyanato complex:**
   - The blue complex is \( [\text{Co(SCN)}_4]^{2-} \), which corresponds to \( f_4 \). However, the question specifies "dithiocyanato," which refers to complexes with **two SCN ligands**. This corresponds to \( [\text{Co(SCN)}_2]^0 \), with fraction \( f_2 \).

### Final Answer:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes is \( f_2 \approx 16.9\% \).
