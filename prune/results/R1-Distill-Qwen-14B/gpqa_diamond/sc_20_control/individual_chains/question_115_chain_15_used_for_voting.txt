Alright, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Okay, let's read it again.

An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is also moving along the horizontal axis, but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After colliding, both annihilate producing two photons. The energies of both photons were measured and they have the same value. The directions were also measured. One of the photons was moving in the upper-right direction, while another in the lower-right direction. What is the angle between the directions of the photons?

Hmm. So, the setup involves an electron and a positron colliding and annihilating into two photons. Since they annihilate, their rest mass energy will contribute to the photons' energy. Wait, but each photon has the same energy. So, the total energy from the annihilation must be split equally between the two photons.

But wait, the electron and positron are moving with different Lorentz factors. So their energies are different.

Wait, Lorentz factor gamma is given for each. The electron has gamma_e =4, and the positron gamma_p=2.

So, the total energy before annihilation is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron.

Energy of each particle is gamma * m0 c². So, electron energy E_e = 4 * m_e c², positron E_p = 2 * m_e c². Since positron has same mass as electron.

So total energy E_total = (4 + 2) m_e c² = 6 m_e c².

But wait, annihilation of electron-positron pair produces photons. Since the initial particles are moving in opposite directions, but along the same line, their momenta will depend on their velocities.

Wait, but in annihilation, their rest mass energy is converted into photons. But when they are moving, their kinetic energy plus rest mass energy contributes to the photon energy.

Wait, but when two particles annihilate, the conservation of energy and momentum must hold. So, in the center-of-momentum frame, the photons would go in opposite directions. But in the lab frame, where their initial momenta are opposite, it's a bit more complicated.

Wait, but the problem states that after annihilation, there are two photons with the same energy. So both photons have the same energy, E_photon = 3 m_e c², since 6 m_e c² divided by two is 3 each.

Wait, wait no. Let me think again. The total energy is 6 m_e c², so each photon has energy 3 m_e c². Because E_photon = E_total / 2.

But wait, the rest mass energy of electron is about 0.511 MeV, so each photon would have 3*0.511 MeV = 1.533 MeV. Hmm.

But how about momentum? The total momentum before annihilation is sum of the momenta of the electron and positron.

Momentum for each is gamma * m0 * v. Wait, or is it gamma m0 v, or gamma m0 beta c?

Yes, momentum p = gamma * m0 * v. But v is related to beta (beta = v/c) so p = gamma m0 beta c.

Another way, p = gamma m0 * beta c.

But for each particle, let's calculate their momenta.

Electron: moving left to right, so positive x direction. Lorentz factor gamma_e =4.

Positron: moving right to left, so negative x direction. Lorentz factor gamma_p=2.

Wait, no, the positron is moving from the right, so it's moving towards the left, same as the electron is moving to the right. So, same direction? Or opposite?

Wait, the electron is moving from the left (so to the right). The positron is moving from the right, so to the left. So they're moving towards each other along the same line.

So their velocities are in opposite directions.

So, their momenta are opposite in direction as well. So, the total momentum is p_e (right) + p_p (left) = p_e - p_p.

Wait, but what is their momentum magnitude?

p_e = gamma_e * m_e * beta_e * c

Similarly, p_p = gamma_p * m_e * beta_p * c.

But since gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²), beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²).

So, for electron, gamma_e=4: beta_e = sqrt(1 - 1/(4²)) = sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.968 c.

Similarly, for positron, gamma_p=2: beta_p = sqrt(1 - 1/4) = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866 c.

So, p_e = 4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4) c = m_e * sqrt(15) c.

p_p = 2 * m_e * (sqrt(3)/2) c = m_e * sqrt(3) c.

So, the momenta are p_e (right) = m_e sqrt(15) c, and p_p (left) = m_e sqrt(3) c.

So, the total momentum is p_total = p_e (right) - p_p (left) [since the positron is moving left, its momentum is opposite, so subtracting? Wait, no: the positron's momentum is in the opposite direction. So when adding, it's p_e (positive) and p_p (negative).

Wait, if electron is moving right, its momentum +p, positron moving left, momentum -p. So total momentum is p_e - p_p.

So, p_total = (m_e sqrt(15) c) - (m_e sqrt(3) c) ) = m_e c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ).

Wait, but sqrt(15) is about 3.872, sqrt(3)=1.732. So sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)≈2.140. So p_total is positive, meaning net momentum is to the right.

After annihilation, the two photons must carry away this total momentum. So, their combined momentum must equal p_total.

But photons carry momentum p_photon = E_photon / c, and direction depends on their motion. Since both photons have the same energy, their momenta magnitudes are equal.

Let me denote the directions: one photon is moving upper-right, the other lower-right. So both are moving to the right, but at different angles relative to the x-axis.

Wait, no, both are in the right direction, but one is above the x-axis (like northeast) and the other is below (southeast), but in this case, since the initial momentum is along x, perhaps the angles are symmetric above and below the x-axis.

Wait, but the total momentum of the photons must be in the same direction as the initial total momentum, which is along x.

So, each photon has momentum p_photon, and the vector sum of their momenta must equal the initial total momentum.

So, let me model the momenta vectors.

Let photon 1 have direction making angle theta above the x-axis, and photon 2 making theta below (so the same magnitude of angle but opposite in sign).

Wait, but the problem says one is upper-right and the other lower-right. So both photons are moving to the right, but one is above x (like +y) and the other is below (like -y). So their angles are +theta and -theta.

So, their momentum vectors would be:

Photon 1: p1 = p_photon * (cos theta, sin theta)
Photon 2: p2 = p_photon * (cos theta, -sin theta) [since same energy, same magnitude, but opposite y-component]

So, the sum of the momentum vectors is (p1 + p2) = (2 p_photon cos theta, 0) )

Wait, but earlier I thought the total momentum is along x. So the sum of the photons' momenta must be along x.

Which matches, since the sum is in x direction, only.

But wait, wait. The initial total momentum is along x, so the photons' momenta should sum to that.

So, the sum of the photons' momenta is (2 p_photon cos theta) in x direction. But this must equal the initial total momentum, which was p_total = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

But wait, each photon's momentum is E_photon / c, since for photons, p = E/c.

So, each photon has E_photon = 3 m_e c². So, their momentum is p_photon = (3 m_e c²) / c = 3 m_e c.

So, each photon's momentum magnitude is 3 m_e c.

So, the sum of the two photons' x-components is 2 * (3 m_e c) * cos theta.

Set this equal to the initial total momentum:

2 * 3 m_e c cos theta = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) )

Simplify:

6 m_e c cos theta = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) )

Divide both sides by m_e c:

6 cos theta = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)

So, cos theta = [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)] / 6

Let me compute this value numerically.

Compute sqrt(15): approximately 3.87298

sqrt(3): approximately 1.73205

sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈ 3.87298 - 1.73205 ≈ 2.14093

Divide by 6: 2.14093 /6 ≈ 0.35682.

So, cos theta ≈ 0.35682.

So, theta ≈ arccos(0.35682) ≈ about 69 degrees.

Wait, because cos(60°)=0.5, and cos(70°)≈0.3420, so 0.3568 would be around 69 degrees. Let me compute more accurately.

But wait, if the angle is such that each photon is making theta and -theta with the x-axis, then the angle between them is 2 theta.

Wait, no. Because each photon is at theta above and below the x-axis, so the angle between them would be 2 theta.

Wait, for example, if one photon is at +theta, the other at -theta, the angle between their directions is 2 theta.

But wait, the problem states that the photons have same energy, and one is upper-right, another lower-right. So the angle between their directions is 2 theta.

So, if theta is 69 degrees, angle between them is 138 degrees.

Looking at the options, option C is 138.

So, the answer should be 138 degrees.

But let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, let me compute sqrt(15) more precisely. 3.872983346.

sqrt(3) is about 1.732050808.

Subtracting gives 3.872983346 -1.732050808 = 2.140932538.

Divide by 6: 2.140932538 /6 ≈ 0.3568220897.

Arccos of that: cos⁻¹(0.356822) ≈ 69 degrees.

Wait, let me compute using calculator.

Let me compute cos⁻¹(0.356822):

I know that cos(60°)=0.5, cos(70°)=≈0.3420, so 0.3568 is between 60 and 70.

Compute 69 degrees: cos(69)= approx 0.3584. Close to 0.3568.

Wait, 69 degrees: cos(69°) ≈ 0.3584.

Wait, the value is 0.3568, which is a bit less than 0.3584. So the angle is a bit larger than 69, perhaps 69.2 degrees.

But to get precise, 0.3568.

Alternatively, perhaps use a calculator.

Alternatively, using a calculator for cos⁻¹(0.3568):

Wait, I can approximate.

Let’s think in radians for a moment. 60 degrees is π/3 ≈1.047 rad.

70 degrees is ≈1.2217 rad.

0.3568 is between cos(69°) and cos(70°).

Let me compute cos(69) ≈ 0.3584.

We have 0.3568 is less than that by 0.0016.

So, the angle is a little larger than 69 degrees.

Wait, using linear approximation.

At theta =69°, cos(theta)=0.3584.

d(cos theta)/d theta = -sin theta.

At 69 degrees, sin(69)= approx 0.93358.

So, delta cos theta = - (sin theta) * delta theta.

We have cos theta decreases by 0.0016 (from 0.3584 to 0.3568), so delta cos theta= -0.0016.

So, delta theta ≈ (delta cos theta) / (-sin theta) ) → delta theta ≈ ( -0.0016 ) / (-0.93358 ) → ≈ 0.0016/0.93358 ≈ 0.001714 radians.

Convert 0.001714 radians to degrees: 0.001714 * (180/pi) ≈ 0.001714 *57.2958 ≈ 0.098 degrees.

So theta is about 69 + 0.098 ≈ 69.098 degrees.

So, theta ≈69.1 degrees.

Thus, the angle between the two photons is 2*theta≈138.2 degrees.

Looking at the options, option C is 138 degrees, so that's the answer.

To solve the problem, we analyze the annihilation of an electron and a positron into two photons. The electron and positron are moving along the horizontal axis with Lorentz factors of 4 and 2, respectively. Their total energy is the sum of their relativistic energies:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = \gamma_e m_e c^2 + \gamma_p m_e c^2 = (4 + 2) m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2
\]

Since the photons have equal energies, each photon carries an energy of:

\[
E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{total}}}{2} = 3 m_e c^2
\]

The total momentum of the system before annihilation is the vector sum of the momenta of the electron and positron. The momentum of each particle is given by:

\[
p = \gamma m_e \beta c
\]

For the electron (\(\gamma_e = 4\)):

\[
\beta_e = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_e^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{16}} = \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4}
\]

\[
p_e = \gamma_e m_e \beta_e c = 4 m_e \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4} c = m_e \sqrt{15} c
\]

For the positron (\(\gamma_p = 2\)):

\[
\beta_p = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_p^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

\[
p_p = \gamma_p m_e \beta_p c = 2 m_e \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} c = m_e \sqrt{3} c
\]

The total momentum is:

\[
p_{\text{total}} = p_e - p_p = m_e \sqrt{15} c - m_e \sqrt{3} c = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3})
\]

After annihilation, the photons' momenta must conserve the total momentum. Since the photons have equal energies, their momenta magnitudes are equal (\(p_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{photon}}}{c} = 3 m_e c\)). Let the photons make angles \(\theta\) and \(-\theta\) with the horizontal axis. Their momentum components are:

\[
\text{Photon 1: } p_1 = (p_{\text{photon}} \cos\theta, p_{\text{photon}} \sin\theta)
\]
\[
\text{Photon 2: } p_2 = (p_{\text{photon}} \cos\theta, -p_{\text{photon}} \sin\theta)
\]

The total momentum of the photons is:

\[
p_{\text{total, photons}} = (2 p_{\text{photon}} \cos\theta, 0)
\]

Equating this to the initial total momentum:

\[
2 p_{\text{photon}} \cos\theta = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3})
\]

Substitute \(p_{\text{photon}} = 3 m_e c\):

\[
2 (3 m_e c) \cos\theta = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3})
\]

Simplify:

\[
6 \cos\theta = \sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}
\]

\[
\cos\theta = \frac{\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}}{6}
\]

Numerically:

\[
\sqrt{15} \approx 3.872, \quad \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732
\]
\[
\cos\theta = \frac{3.872 - 1.732}{6} = \frac{2.140}{6} \approx 0.3568
\]

\[
\theta \approx \arccos(0.3568) \approx 69^\circ
\]

The angle between the two photons is:

\[
\phi = 2\theta \approx 2 \times 69^\circ = 138^\circ
\]

Thus, the angle between the directions of the photons is **138 degrees**.
