Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down. Let me think.

The question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Hmm, uniform distribution usually means that the number of stars doesn't change with direction, right? So they spread out evenly in all directions. Now, the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx.

Wait, parallax is a measure of distance. I remember that parallax is inversely proportional to distance. The formula is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs), so the bigger the parallax, the closer the star is. But wait, no, wait—if plx is in arcseconds, then distance d (in parsecs) is 1/plx. So higher plx means closer stars.

The question is about the number of stars per unit plx. So, if I imagine a range of plx values, how many stars fall into each small slice of that range.

Since stars are uniformly distributed, their number density in space is the same everywhere. But because we're talking about parallax, which relates to distance, the number of stars we observe in a certain plx range depends on the volume of space at that distance.

Wait, the number of stars per unit volume is constant. So the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d would be proportional to the surface area of that shell times the thickness. Surface area of a sphere is 4πr², right? So for a thin shell with thickness dr, the number of stars would be (4πd²) * (number density) * dr.

But wait, how does this relate to parallax? Because plx is 1/d. Let's denote plx as p, so d = 1/p. So dr is the change in distance, but I think we need to express everything in terms of p.

Let me think. Let's say we have a small change in parallax, Δp. What is the corresponding change in distance, Δd? Because d = 1/p, so Δd = - (1/p²) Δp. Wait, because if p increases (say from p to p+Δp), the distance d would decrease from 1/p to 1/(p+Δp). So the change in d is negative, but since we're dealing with small Δp, it's approximately - (1/p²) Δp. But since we're looking for the number of stars in a range of p, perhaps we can take the absolute value, so Δd ≈ (1/p²) Δp.

Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to express the number of stars in terms of parallax. So the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d is proportional to the surface area (4πd²) times the volume element (thickness dr), times the number density (n). But since we want to express this in terms of p, which is 1/d, let's substitute d = 1/p.

So the surface area is 4π (1/p)^2. The volume element dr is the derivative of d with respect to p. Let me think, since p = 1/d, then dp = - (1/d²) dd. So, solving for dd, we get dd = - d² dp. Substituting d = 1/p, we have dd = - (1/p^2) dp. The negative sign indicates that as p increases, d decreases, but when considering the magnitude, it's (1/p^2) dp.

So the number of stars, N, in a thin shell at parallax p would be the number density (n) times the volume of the shell. The volume of the shell is surface area times thickness. So:

N = n * (4π (1/p)^2) * ( (1/p^2) dp )

Because dr is (1/p²) dp, and the surface area is 4pi (1/p)^2.

So N = n * 4π * (1/p^2) * (1/p^2) dp = n *4π * (1/p^4) dp.

Wait, so the number of stars per unit range of p (Δp) is proportional to 1/p^4. Because N is proportional to (1/p^4) dp.

But wait, the question is about the number per unit range of plx. So for a small change in p, dp, the number N is proportional to 1/p^4. So as p increases, the number of stars per unit plx range decreases as 1/p^4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4. So the correct answer would be A.

But wait, let me make sure. Another approach: think about how the number of stars per unit volume is uniform, but to find how many are in a given range of parallax, which relates to a thin shell at distance d.

The volume of a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr is 4pi d^2 dr. So the number of stars in this shell is n * 4pi d^2 dr, where n is the number density.

But d =1/p, so dr = - (1/p^2) dp. So substituting:

Number of stars = n *4pi (1/p)^2 * (1/p^2 dp ) = n *4pi * (1/p^4) dp.

So again, the number per unit p is proportional to 1/p^4, so the number per unit range (dp) of p is proportional to 1/p^4.

Therefore, the answer is A.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that stars are uniformly distributed in space. Parallax, \( p \), is inversely proportional to distance, \( d \), such that \( p = 1/d \). The number of stars in a thin shell at distance \( d \) is proportional to the surface area of the shell (\( 4\pi d^2 \)) and the thickness of the shell (\( dr \)), multiplied by the number density of stars (\( n \)).

Expressing distance in terms of parallax, \( d = 1/p \), and substituting \( dr \) in terms of \( dp \), we find \( dr = -\frac{1}{p^2} dp \). The number of stars in the thin shell is then:

\[
N = n \cdot 4\pi d^2 \cdot dr
\]

Substituting \( d = 1/p \) and \( dr = -\frac{1}{p^2} dp \), we get:

\[
N = n \cdot 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{p^2}\right) \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{p^2} dp\right)
\]

Simplifying, the number of stars per unit range of \( p \) is proportional to:

\[
N \propto \frac{1}{p^4}
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( 1/p^4 \). Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:

**A) ~ 1/plx^4**
