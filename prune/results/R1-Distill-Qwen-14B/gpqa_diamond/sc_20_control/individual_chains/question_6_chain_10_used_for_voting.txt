Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the energy spectrum for a particle in a specific potential. Hmm, let me read the question again.

The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Oh wait, so it's a function of r and θ. I remember that in two-dimensional polar coordinates, the potential can sometimes be solved by separating the problem into radial and angular parts.

Wait, the form of the potential... Let me think. The first term is (1/2)k r², which looks like a harmonic oscillator potential, because I recall that the harmonic oscillator has a potential of (1/2) m ω² r². Oh, but in that case, the mass is included. Here, the potential is expressed in terms of k, but when we get into the Hamiltonian, the mass m will come into play.

The second term is (3/2) k r² cos²θ. That seems a bit tricky. Cos squared theta makes me think of angular dependence. But how does this affect the separation of variables?

I think I should write the Hamiltonian for this system. The Hamiltonian in polar coordinates is (p_r²)/(2m) + (p_θ²)/(2m r²) + V(r, θ). So the kinetic parts are the radial and angular momentum terms.

Wait, but the potential here is V = (½)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let me factor that. It can be written as V(r,θ) = (½)k r² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Alternatively, maybe I can separate the terms based on theta.

Wait, another approach: perhaps this potential can be expressed in terms of angular momentum. Because the potential has a cos²θ term, which relates to the angular part.

I remember that in some potentials, like the anisotropic harmonic oscillator, the potential has terms in r² and r² cos²θ, leading to a separation into radial and angular parts but with different coefficients.

Wait, let me consider that. Let me think about how the potential affects each direction. In polar coordinates, perhaps it's better to switch to Cartesian coordinates to see the anisotropy.

Alternatively, maybe I can write the potential in terms of x and y. Because cosθ = x/r and sinθ = y/r. So, cos²θ = (x²)/(r²). So, the potential becomes V(r, θ) = (½)k r² + (3/2)k r² (x²/r²) = (½)k r² + (3/2)k x².

Wait, that would make the potential V = (½)k r² + (3/2)k x². But r² is x² + y², so substituting that in, V = (½)k(x² + y²) + (3/2)k x² = (½ + 3/2)k x² + (½)k y². So that's 2k x² + (½)k y². Oh, so the potential is like a 2D harmonic oscillator with different frequencies in x and y directions.

Wait, that's interesting. So the potential is separable into x and y terms. So the Hamiltonian would be H = (p_x² + p_y²)/(2m) + V(x,y), where V(x,y) = 2k x² + (½)k y².

Wait, so treating it as a 2D harmonic oscillator with different frequencies. Because each direction's potential is quadratic.

In a 2D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are quantized for each direction and then add together. The energy for each direction is (n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x for x and (n_y + 1/2) ℏ ω_y for y, where ω_x and ω_y are the angular frequencies in x and y directions.

So what's ω_x and ω_y here? The general form for a harmonic oscillator in x is (1/2) m ω² x². So in our case, the x potential is 2k x², which is (1/2) m ω_x² x². So 2k = (1/2) m ω_x², so ω_x² = (4k)/m, so ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m). Wait, wait, let me compute that again.

Wait, the standard form is (1/2) m ω² x². So the potential energy for x is 2k x². That equals (1/2) m ω_x² x². So 2k = (1/2) m ω_x². So solving for ω_x:

ω_x² = (4k) / m.

So ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m). Similarly, for y, the potential is (½)k y², which is (1/2) m ω_y² y². So (½)k = (1/2)m ω_y². So ω_y² = k/m → ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

So the energies for each direction are:

E_x = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ (2 sqrt(k/m)) = (2n_x + 1) ℏ sqrt(k/m) * (1/2 * 2 ? Wait, no. Wait, let's compute it correctly.

Wait, ω_x is 2 sqrt(k/m), so E_x = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ * 2 sqrt(k/m) = (2n_x + 1) ℏ sqrt(k/m) * (1/2?) Wait, no, wait: 2 sqrt(k/m) is just 2 times. So:

E_x = (n_x + 1/2) * ℏ * 2 sqrt(k/m) = (2n_x + 1) ℏ sqrt(k/m) * (1/2?) No, wait, 2 sqrt(k/m) multiplied by (n_x + 1/2) ℏ.

Wait, let me compute it step by step. The frequency is ω = sqrt(k/m) for the y direction and 2 sqrt(k/m) for the x direction. So, for x:

E_x = (n_x + 1/2) * ℏ * (2 sqrt(k/m)).

And for y:

E_y = (n_y + 1/2) * ℏ * sqrt(k/m).

So the total energy is E = E_x + E_y.

Putting them together:

E = (n_x + 1/2) * 2 ℏ sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Let me factor out ℏ sqrt(k/m):

E = [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] * ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Expanding the terms inside:

2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 = 2n_x + n_y + 3/2.

So E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Wait, looking at the options, option C is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m). That matches.

But let me double-check if I did the frequencies correctly.

The potential in x is 2k x², which comes from the original V(r,θ) after expansion. So yes, V_x = 2k x².

Expressed as (1/2) m ω_x² x², so (1/2) m ω_x² = 2k → ω_x² = (4k)/m → ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m).

Same for y: V_y = (½)k y², so (1/2) m ω_y² = (½)k → ω_y² = k/m → ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

So the expressions for E_x and E_y are correct.

So total energy is sum of both:

E = (2n_x +1) * (ℏ sqrt(k/m)) + (n_y +1/2) * ℏ sqrt(k/m), but wait, no:

Wait, E_x is (n_x + 1/2) * ℏ * 2 sqrt(k/m) = (2n_x + 1) * (ℏ sqrt(k/m)) * (1/2 * 2?) No, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate that.

Wait, E_x = (n_x + 1/2) * ℏ * ω_x.

And ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m).

So E_x = (n_x + 1/2) * ℏ * 2 sqrt(k/m) = [2(n_x + 1/2)] * ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Which simplifies to (2n_x + 1) * ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Similarly, E_y = (n_y + 1/2) * ℏ * sqrt(k/m).

So adding them:

E = (2n_x +1 + n_y + 1/2) * ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Which is (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ℏ sqrt(k/m). So yes, option C.

But wait, let me look at the options again.

Option C says E = (2n_x + n_y +3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m), which is exactly what I got.

So the correct answer should be option C.

The potential is given as \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cos^2\theta \). To analyze the energy spectrum, we first rewrite the potential in Cartesian coordinates. Using the relations \( \cos\theta = \frac{x}{r} \) and \( r^2 = x^2 + y^2 \), the potential becomes:

\[
V(x, y) = \frac{1}{2}k(x^2 + y^2) + \frac{3}{2}kx^2 = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2.
\]

This describes a 2D harmonic oscillator with different frequencies in the \(x\)- and \(y\)-directions. The energy levels for a 2D harmonic oscillator are the sum of the energy levels in each direction. For a harmonic oscillator in the \(x\)-direction with potential \(2kx^2\), the angular frequency is:

\[
\omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}},
\]

and the energy level is:

\[
E_x = \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_x = \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} = \left(2n_x + 1\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

For the \(y\)-direction with potential \(\frac{1}{2}ky^2\), the angular frequency is:

\[
\omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}},
\]

and the energy level is:

\[
E_y = \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_y = \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

The total energy is the sum of \(E_x\) and \(E_y\):

\[
E = E_x + E_y = \left(2n_x + 1\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} + \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

Factoring out \(\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\), we get:

\[
E = \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

Comparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:

**C) \(E = (2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2})\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\).**

Wait, that would make the potential V = (½)k r² + (3/2)k x². But r² is x² + y², so substituting that in, V = (½)k(x² + y²) + (3/2)k x² = (½ + 3/2)k x² + (½)k y². So that's 2k x² + (½)k y². Oh, so the potential is like a 2D harmonic oscillator with different frequencies in x and y directions.

Wait, that's interesting. So the potential is separable into x and y terms. So the Hamiltonian would be H = (p_x² + p_y²)/(2m) + V(x,y), where V(x,y) = 2k x² + (½)k y².

Wait, so treating it as a 2D harmonic oscillator with different frequencies. Because each direction's potential is quadratic.

Wait, the standard form is (1/2) m ω² x². So the potential energy for x is 2k x². That equals (1/2) m ω_x² x². So 2k = (1/2) m ω_x². So solving for ω_x:

ω_x² = (4k) / m.

So ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m). Similarly, for y, the potential is (½)k y², which is (1/2) m ω_y² y². So (½)k = (1/2)m ω_y². So ω_y² = k/m → ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

So the energies for each direction are:

E_x = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ (2 sqrt(k/m)) = (2n_x + 1) ℏ sqrt(k/m) * (1/2 * 2 ? Wait, no. Wait, let's compute it correctly.

Wait, ω_x is 2 sqrt(k/m), so E_x = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ * 2 sqrt(k/m) = (2n_x + 1) ℏ sqrt(k/m) * (1/2?) Wait, no, wait: 2 sqrt(k/m) is just 2 times. So:

E_x = (n_x + 1/2) * ℏ * 2 sqrt(k/m) = (2n_x + 1) ℏ sqrt(k/m) * (1/2?) No, wait, 2 sqrt(k/m) multiplied by (n_x + 1/2) ℏ.

Wait, let me compute it step by step. The frequency is ω = sqrt(k/m) for the y direction and 2 sqrt(k/m) for the x direction. So, for x:

E_x = (n_x + 1/2) * ℏ * (2 sqrt(k/m)).

And for y:

E_y = (n_y + 1/2) * ℏ * sqrt(k/m).

So the total energy is E = E_x + E_y.

Putting them together:

E = (n_x + 1/2) * 2 ℏ sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Let me factor out ℏ sqrt(k/m):

E = [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] * ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Expanding the terms inside:

2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 = 2n_x + n_y + 3/2.

So E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Wait, looking at the options, option C is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m). That matches.

Wait, E_x is (n_x + 1/2) * ℏ * 2 sqrt(k/m) = (2n_x + 1) * (ℏ sqrt(k/m)) * (1/2 * 2?) No, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate that.

The potential is given as \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cos^2\theta \). To analyze the energy spectrum, we first rewrite the potential in Cartesian coordinates. Using the relations \( \cos\theta = \frac{x}{r} \) and \( r^2 = x^2 + y^2 \), the potential becomes:

\[
V(x, y) = \frac{1}{2}k(x^2 + y^2) + \frac{3}{2}kx^2 = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2.
\]

This describes a 2D harmonic oscillator with different frequencies in the \(x\)- and \(y\)-directions. The energy levels for a 2D harmonic oscillator are the sum of the energy levels in each direction. For a harmonic oscillator in the \(x\)-direction with potential \(2kx^2\), the angular frequency is:

\[
\omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}},
\]

and the energy level is:

\[
E_x = \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_x = \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} = \left(2n_x + 1\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

For the \(y\)-direction with potential \(\frac{1}{2}ky^2\), the angular frequency is:

\[
\omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}},
\]

and the energy level is:

\[
E_y = \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_y = \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

The total energy is the sum of \(E_x\) and \(E_y\):

\[
E = E_x + E_y = \left(2n_x + 1\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} + \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

Factoring out \(\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\), we get:

\[
E = \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

Comparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:

**C) \(E = (2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2})\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\).**
