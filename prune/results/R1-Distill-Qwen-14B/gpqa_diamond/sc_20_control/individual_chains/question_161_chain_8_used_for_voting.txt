Okay, so I've got this question about electron microscopes and mean free paths. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

Alright, the setup is that Mike is working with a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at 1000 kV. He's using vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, like less than 1e-9 Torr in the sample compartment. The idea is to remove gas molecules to improve imaging because fewer gas particles mean less electron scattering, right?

But even after creating that vacuum, some gas molecules are still there, and Mike measures their mean free path as λ1. Mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, I remember that. It depends on things like pressure, temperature, and the size of the molecules.

Then, when he turns on the electron beam, he notices something interesting: the mean free path changes to λ2, which isn't the same as λ1. But the temperature is the same, so that can't be the factor changing here.

Wait, so why would the mean free path change when the electron beam is on? Oh, right! When the electron beam is active, especially at high voltages like 1000 kV, the electrons are moving really fast and have a lot of energy. They can potentially interact with the gas molecules in the compartment.

In the initial state (vacuum pumps running, before the beam is on), the mean free path λ1 is determined by the gas density in the ultra-high vacuum. But when the beam is on, the electrons are passing through the gas. They might be causing the gas molecules to ionize or even knock them out of the compartment. Oh, right, that's called sputtering or maybe gas desorption.

So when the beam is on, the gas pressure effectively increases because the electron beam is causing more interactions. Wait, but no, wait. If the electrons are hitting the gas molecules, they may ionize them, and charged particles would be more likely to be pumped away by the vacuum system. So the number of gas particles in the compartment might decrease because of this effect. Alternatively, maybe the mean free path would increase because there are fewer particles, but that doesn't make sense because the beam is causing more gas particles to be removed.

Wait, let me think again. The initial mean free path λ1 is under the ultra-high vacuum condition. When the beam is on, the gas molecules might be being bombarded by electrons, causing them to be accelerated and perhaps removed from the compartment. So the effective pressure would decrease, meaning the mean free path would increase. Because pressure and mean free path are inversely related.

Wait, wait. The mean free path λ is given by λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2) * π * d² * P), where d is the diameter of the gas molecules, T is temperature, and P is pressure. So higher pressure leads to shorter λ, lower pressure leads to longer λ.

In this scenario, when the beam is on, perhaps some gas is being removed. So the pressure would be lower, so λ increases. But Mike observes λ2 instead of λ1. So λ2 would be greater than λ1, right?

Wait, but the answer options are about λ2 in relation to λ1. If the mean free path increases, that would mean λ2 > λ1.

Looking at the options:

A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1

C) λ2 < λ1

Hmm, so in our case, we thought λ2 would be larger than λ1 because pressure decreased, so λ increased.

Wait, but wait another thing. The electron beam could also cause the gas to heat up, but the question states that the temperature remains the same. So thermal expansion isn't a factor here.

Alternatively, maybe the presence of the electron beam causes the gas molecules to be excited or ionized, which might affect their collisions. But I'm not sure about that. Do ionized gas particles have a different effective diameter or something?

Wait, another angle. The mean free path is calculated based on the number density of the gas. If the number of gas molecules decreases when the beam is on (because of ejection), the pressure P would decrease, so λ would increase.

So λ2 would be greater than λ1.

So looking at the options, which ones say λ2 is greater than λ1? Option A and D. Wait.

But wait, the question says Mike found that the mean free path was no longer equal to λ1. So it's either longer or shorter than λ1.

Wait, but if the gas is being removed due to the beam, the pressure in the compartment would be lower. Lower pressure means higher mean free path. So λ2 would be larger than λ1.

But the options are:

A) λ2 >= 1.22λ1

C) λ2 < λ1

So the correct conclusion would be that λ2 is greater than λ1. So which options are these.

But wait, the possible options are A and D. Wait, looking again at the options:

Option A says λ2 is at least 1.22 times λ1.

Option C says λ2 is less than λ1.

Which one is correct?

Wait, the initial scenario: the mean free path is λ1, which is measured under vacuum conditions. When the beam is on, the pressure might actually increase because of gas particles being desorbed from the walls or something? No, that's unlikely because the vacuum is already ultra-high. Or perhaps the beam creates a wake of gas.

Wait, maybe I got it wrong. Maybe the presence of the electron beam causes more scattering, which would imply more collisions, so the mean free path decreases. That would make λ2 less than λ1.

Wait, but how? Because the beam is moving through the gas, and the gas molecules are stationary, right? So electrons are hitting the gas molecules, but each collision would cause the gas molecules to scatter.

Wait, but the mean free path is about how often the gas molecules collide with each other, not with the electrons. So the presence of the electron beam wouldn't affect the collisions between the gas molecules themselves. So that shouldn't change λ based on gas density.

Hmm, but wait. The electron beam might cause gas ionization, leading to a higher number of charged particles in the compartment. These charged particles might be more quickly pumped away by the vacuum system. So the number of gas particles would decrease, leading to lower pressure, which implies a higher mean free path. So λ2 would be bigger than λ1.

So that would suggest λ2 is greater than λ1. So option A says λ2 >=1.22 λ1.

But wait, Mike's observation is that the mean free path is no longer λ1, but it's λ2. So if the pressure decreases, then λ2 is larger than λ1.

But the options don't have an option where λ2 is greater than λ1 except for A and B. Option B says λ2 equals λ1, which is not the case. So only A is possible.

But wait, in the beginning, the vacuum is ultra-high. So λ1 would be very large, perhaps on the order of meters. But in the presence of the beam, perhaps the mean free path becomes smaller because the electrons are being scattered more.

Wait, no. The mean free path for the gas molecules is about their own collisions, not about the electrons. So the electron beam's presence shouldn't directly affect the gas molecules' mean free path. Unless the beam causes the gas to be removed, which would reduce pressure, hence increase mean free path.

So λ2 would be longer than λ1.

Looking at the options, option A says λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1. So that would be the case. So why 1.22? Hmm, 1.22 is approximately sqrt(2), which comes into play in the mean free path equation. Wait, the mean free path equation is λ = 1/(sqrt(2) n π d²), where n is number density. If n decreases, λ increases.

But in this scenario, if the number of gas particles decreases (n goes down), λ increases. So λ2 would be greater than λ1.

But the options don't include 'greater than λ1' except A and D.

Wait, but the options are:

A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1

C) λ2 < λ1

Hmm. So if our reasoning says λ2 is larger, then option A or perhaps another. But the options don't have a 'λ2 > λ1' without the 1.22 factor.

Wait, the problem says Mike accurately determined λ1 based on factors such as sample compartment volume, pressure, and temperature. So when the beam is on, perhaps the effective pressure in the compartment is lower, so the mean free path is longer.

But why would the mean free path change? Because the electron beam is causing gas to be removed, so pressure decreases → mean free path increases.

So in that case, λ2 > λ1.

So the correct answer would be that λ2 is greater than λ1. But looking at the options, only option A and D talk about λ2 being larger than λ1. Wait, no. Option A says '>=', D says λ1 < λ2 < 1.22 λ1. Hmm, so if the pressure decreases, the mean free path would increase. But how much? The initial mean free path is λ1. If the pressure is lower, the mean free path is higher.

But how much higher? Let's think about the formula for mean free path.

The mean free path λ is given by λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2) π d² P), where P is the pressure. So if P decreases, λ increases.

In this scenario, when the electron beam is on, the pressure P decreases because gas is being removed. So λ2 would be larger than λ1.

But the options don't have 'λ2 > λ1' as a general option. Only A says '>=1.22 λ1', or C says less than.

So why would the mean free path change? Because the presence of the electron beam may cause the gas pressure to increase due to gas molecules being ionized and then accelerated by the electric field, causing them to strike the walls and be removed. So perhaps the number of gas molecules in the compartment is lower, which lowers the pressure, making λ2 higher.

But how much higher would that be? Without exact numbers, it's hard to say. But the problem states that Mike made an observation, implying that λ2 is different. So what could cause λ2 to be different?

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. The question says that Mike found that the mean free path was no longer λ1, but λ2.

Wait, but the mean free path for the gas molecules is determined by the gas pressure. If the electron beam is causing the gas to be removed, the pressure in the compartment is lower, so λ increases. So λ2 would be greater than λ1.

But looking at the options, option A says λ2 is >=1.22 λ1. So if the pressure is lower, λ2 is larger. So that would make option A correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam leads to a higher collision rate for the gas molecules, thus decreasing the mean free path. But that seems counterintuitive because the beam itself isn't part of the gas.

Another thought: maybe the electron beam induces some forces that cause the gas molecules to be more effective scatterers. But I'm not sure about that. The mean free path is about the gas's own collisions, not about scattering with the beam.

Wait, perhaps the initial λ1 is based on the gas pressure before the beam is on. When the beam is on, the gas molecules might be more mobile or something, but the temperature is the same, so that shouldn't matter.

Wait, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes the gas to be ionized, which would affect their mean free path. But ionized gas (plasma) behaves differently. But in a high vacuum, the ionization might not significantly change the pressure because the ions would be quickly removed by the pumps.

So in that case, the pressure would decrease, λ increases.

So the conclusion is that λ2 is greater than λ1, which would be option A or D.

Wait, but the options are:

A) λ2 >=1.22λ1

C) λ2 < λ1

So, only A considers λ2 larger.

But why 1.22? Let me think.

The mean free path is inversely proportional to the square root of the pressure. So if the pressure is reduced by a factor, the mean free path increases by the square root of the inverse.

But without knowing the exact change in pressure, it's hard to say if λ2 is more than 1.22 times λ1.

Wait, but the problem says that the presence of the electron beam causes some change in the mean free path. So if the mean free path becomes longer, the correct choice is A or another.

But why is option A 1.22 times? Maybe because the mean free path calculation when considering electron beam scattering is different.

Wait, another possibility: when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules may have a higher chance of scattering electrons, leading to more frequent collisions, which could effectively lower their mean free path. But that's about electron scattering, not gas molecule scattering.

Wait, the mean free path for the gas molecules is about their collisions with each other, not with the electrons. So the presence of the electron beam wouldn't change the gas molecules' collisions. So the mean free path should remain λ1, but Mike observes λ2 not equal to λ1. So that implies that the number of gas molecules has changed.

Wait, perhaps when the electron beam is on, gas molecules are being knocked out or ionized, effectively lowering the pressure, which would increase the mean free path. So λ2 would be larger than λ1.

So why that would be the case.

But looking at the options, only option A suggests λ2 is larger than λ1.

Wait, maybe the mean free path decreases, meaning λ2 is smaller than λ1. How?

If the electron beam causes the gas to heat up, but the question says temperature remains the same.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam is causing gas to be released from the walls of the compartment. So more gas is in the compartment, increasing the pressure, which would decrease the mean free path. But that would mean λ2 < λ1.

But that seems unlikely because the vacuum pumps are running, which should be removing any gas released.

Hmm. I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: the mean free path is given by λ = 1/(n π d²), where n is the number density. So if the number of gas molecules increases, then n increases, and λ decreases.

But why would the number of gas molecules increase when the beam is on? Unless the beam is causing gas to be released from the walls or the sample. But the initial state was already ultra-high vacuum, so perhaps some molecules were adsorbed on the walls. The electron beam could desorb them, increasing the number of gas molecules in the compartment.

Ah, that makes sense. So when the beam is on, it might cause gas molecules that were adsorbed on the walls to desorb into the compartment. So the pressure increases, and the mean free path decreases.

So in that case, λ2 would be less than λ1. That would make option C correct.

But wait, why would the pressure increase? Because the number of gas molecules would increase. So if some gas was absorbed on the walls and the beam desorbs them, the pressure goes up, so λ decreases.

But the initial λ1 was calculated in the ultra-high vacuum state. So when the beam is on, the pressure is higher, so λ2 is smaller than λ1.

So the correct answer is C.

Wait, but why would the beam cause gas desorption? Because high-energy electrons can have enough energy to knock gas molecules off the walls. That's called sputtering. So in that case, the number of gas molecules in the compartment would increase, leading to higher pressure and lower mean free path.

So in this case, λ2 would be less than λ1. So the correct answer is C: λ2 < λ1.

Mike is operating a high-resolution transmission electron microscope at 1000 kV, using vacuum pumps to achieve an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment (< 10⁻⁹ Torr). The mean free path of gas molecules in this vacuum is initially determined to be λ₁. However, upon initiating the electron beam, Mike observes a change in the mean free path to λ₂. The question asks how λ₂ relates to λ₁.

The mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to the pressure (P) and depends on the number density of gas molecules. When the electron beam is active, high-energy electrons can interact with gas molecules in the compartment. This interaction can cause gas molecules adsorbed on the walls of the compartment to desorb into the gas phase. As a result, the number of gas molecules in the compartment increases, effectively raising the pressure. Since λ is inversely proportional to pressure, an increase in pressure leads to a decrease in the mean free path.

Thus, the presence of the electron beam causes the mean free path to decrease, making λ₂ < λ₁. This aligns with option C.

**Critical analysis of options:**
- **A) λ₂ ≥ 1.22λ₁**: This suggests the mean free path increases significantly, which is inconsistent with the scenario where the electron beam increases gas pressure by desorption.
- **B) λ₂ = λ₁**: This implies no change in the mean free path, which contradicts Mike's observation of a change in λ.
- **C) λ₂ < λ₁**: This is correct, as the electron beam increases gas pressure by desorption, reducing the mean free path.
- **D) λ₁ < λ₂ < 1.22λ₁**: This suggests a moderate increase in the mean free path, which is inconsistent with the observed decrease due to increased gas pressure.

The correct conclusion is that λ₂ < λ₁. 

Answer: C
