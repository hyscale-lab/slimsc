Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The question is about comparing the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term (which I think is related to the Zeeman effect) with the transition energy ΔE of a hydrogen atom. The setup is that the magnetic field B is along the Oz axis and has a value of 1 Tesla. The orbital magnetic quantum number m is small, so probably m=0, 1, or maybe up to a few. The hydrogen atom's transition has a wavelength λ of 0.4861 micrometers, which rings a bell—it's the Balmer series, like the H-alpha line maybe?

Wait, first, I should recall what the paramagnetic coupling term refers to. In atoms, paramagnetism arises from the interaction between the magnetic moment of electrons and an external magnetic field. The Zeeman effect is the splitting of atomic energy levels due to this interaction. So the coupling term is the energy shift due to the magnetic field.

The transition energy ΔE given here is related to the wavelength. Since energy is inversely proportional to wavelength (ΔE = hc/λ), I can calculate ΔE using the given λ. Let's jot that down.

So, λ = 0.4861 μm = 0.4861e-6 meters. Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is 3e8 m/s. So ΔE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (0.4861e-6) 

Let me compute that. 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25. Divided by 0.4861e-6 is 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7. Let's see: 1.9878 /4.861 is approximately 0.409, and exponents: 1e-25 / 1e-7 is 1e-18. So ΔE ≈ 0.409e-18 J, which is about 4.09e-19 J. To convert this to electron volts (eV) because atomic energies are often in eV: 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 4.09e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 2.55 eV. Hmm, but wait, the Balmer series transition is from n=2 to n=1? No, wait, the H-alpha line is n=3 to n=2, which gives a wavelength around 656 nm. Oh, wait, the given wavelength is 0.4861 μm, which is 486.1 nm. That's actually the Balmer's beta line, which is n=4 to n=2. The energy difference for Balmer transitions varies, but typical ΔE is about a few eV? Or wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation. λ is 486.1 nm, which is 486.1e-9 meters. So h=6.626e-34 J·s, c=3e8 m/s. So ΔE = (6.626e-34 *3e8) / (486.1e-9) 

Calculating numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Denominator is 486.1e-9 m. So 1.9878e-25 / 486.1e-9 = (1.9878 /486.1 ) * 1e-25 / 1e-9 = (approx 0.00409) * 1e-16 = 4.09e-19 J. 

Converting to eV: 4.09e-19 J /1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 2.55 eV. So the transition energy ΔE is about 2.55 eV.

Now, what about the paramagnetic coupling term, which is the Zeeman energy shift. The energy shift due to a magnetic field is given by ΔE_Zeeman = μ_B * B * m, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m is the magnetic quantum number. Wait, but wait—actually, the energy shift for each state is proportional to m. So the splitting between adjacent levels is μ_B * B. But for the coupling term, perhaps we're looking at the energy shift for a particular m. For example, for m=1, it's μ_B * B. For m=0, it's zero.

What's the Bohr magneton? μ_B ≈ 9.274e-24 J/T.

So for B=1 T, the shift for m=1 is μ_B * B * m. Wait, wait, the formula is ΔE = m * μ_B * B. So m can be 0, ±1, ±2,..., up to the maximum orbital angular momentum. But since m is small, maybe m=1 or 0. Hmm, but the question says "small values of m", so perhaps m is 0, 1, or 2. Let me proceed.

So for m=1: ΔE = 1 * 9.274e-24 J/T * 1 T = 9.274e-24 J. To convert that to eV: 9.274e-24 /1.602e-19 ≈ 5.79e-5 eV. So about 5.8e-5 eV.

Comparing ΔE_Zeeman (≈5.8e-5 eV) with the transition energy (≈2.55 eV). So 5.8e-5 is much smaller than 2.55. So the Zeeman term is way smaller than the transition energy. Therefore, the paramagnetic coupling term is much less than ΔE. Wait, but wait. Wait, in the problem statement, it says "the paramagnetic coupling term with transition energy ΔE of Hydrogen atom." Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, maybe I'm comparing the correct terms? The paramagnetic coupling term (the Zeeman shift) is the correction in energy due to the magnetic field. The transition energy ΔE is the energy difference between two states in the hydrogen atom, perhaps without the magnetic field. But in any case, for a given transition, how does the Zeeman effect compare in magnitude?

Wait, perhaps I should think of the magnetic field causing a splitting in the energy levels. So for an electron in a certain state, the Zeeman term adds an energy shift. When considering transitions, the selection rules might allow transitions that involve Δm = 0, ±1, etc. But the question is about the magnitude of the coupling term (the Zeeman shift) relative to the transition energy ΔE.

So, the key is to compare the value of the Zeeman energy shift with the transition energy. From the numbers I calculated, the Zeeman shift is about 5.8e-5 eV, which is way smaller than the transition energy of 2.55 eV. So the coupling term is much smaller than ΔE.

Wait, but wait another thing. The orbital magnetic quantum number m is small. So the maximum m is l, but since m is small, perhaps l is small too. But for hydrogen, the energy levels depend on n, and the splitting is proportional to m. Maybe for the 2p state, m can be -1, 0, +1. So the maximum shift is 9.27e-24 J * B * 1. But in any case, the shift is tiny compared to the transition energy.

So, in the problem, the paramagnetic coupling term is much less than the transition energy. Therefore, the average value ⟨H⟩ of the coupling term is much smaller than ΔE. So looking at the options: option C says ⟨H⟩ << ΔE, which would be the correct choice.

To compare the paramagnetic coupling term (Zeeman energy shift) with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom, we proceed as follows:

1. **Transition Energy ΔE**:  
   The transition energy is calculated using the wavelength \( \lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m} = 486.1 \, \text{nm} \). The energy is given by:  
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
   \]  
   Substituting \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \lambda = 486.1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \):  
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{486.1 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 4.09 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
   \]  
   Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):  
   \[
   \Delta E \approx \frac{4.09 \times 10^{-19}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. **Paramagnetic Coupling Term (Zeeman Energy Shift)**:  
   The Zeeman energy shift is given by:  
   \[
   \Delta E_Z = \mu_B \cdot B \cdot m,
   \]  
   where \( \mu_B = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \) is the Bohr magneton, \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \), and \( m \) is the orbital magnetic quantum number. For small \( m \) (e.g., \( m = 1 \)):  
   \[
   \Delta E_Z = (9.274 \times 10^{-24}) \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}.
   \]  
   Converting to electron volts:  
   \[
   \Delta E_Z \approx \frac{9.274 \times 10^{-24}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 5.79 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

3. **Comparison**:  
   The transition energy \( \Delta E \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV} \) is much larger than the Zeeman energy shift \( \Delta E_Z \approx 5.79 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV} \). Thus, the paramagnetic coupling term is orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy.

4. **Conclusion**:  
   The average value of the paramagnetic coupling term \( \langle H \rangle \) is much smaller than the transition energy \( \Delta E \). Therefore, the correct option is:  

**Answer: C**
