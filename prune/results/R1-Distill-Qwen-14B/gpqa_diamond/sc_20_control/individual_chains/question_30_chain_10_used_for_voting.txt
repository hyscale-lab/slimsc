Okay, so I have this question about a textile dye and the light it emits. Hmm, I remember from my chemistry classes that when something emits light, it's because it's releasing energy. But wait, the question is about the color of light absorbed, not emitted. Oh right, because when a compound absorbs a certain wavelength, it emits another. Or wait, no—when something emits light, that's due to electrons dropping back to their original energy levels, right? So the energy emitted would correspond to the energy difference between those levels.

The question says the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. I think that when a substance absorbs light, it excites electrons from a lower energy level to a higher one. And when they drop back, they emit that energy as light. So the energy of the emitted light must be less than the energy absorbed. Because the absorbed energy is what's used to get the electrons up, and when they drop, the difference is what's emitted.

Wait, so the energy of the emitted light is the energy gap between the levels. So that means the absorbed light must have higher energy than the emitted. Because the process is absorption (excitation) followed by emission. So the energy of the absorbed photon would be higher than the emitted one.

So the energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV. Therefore, the absorbed photon must have higher energy. So I need to find the color corresponding to a photon with higher energy than 2.3393 eV.

I remember the visible spectrum goes from violet (highest energy, about 3 eV) to red (lower energy, around 1.6 eV). So if the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV, the absorbed energy must be higher than that. Let me think about the order: higher energy photons are at the blue/violet end.

Wait, I think the energy of light is inversely related to wavelength. So higher energy is shorter wavelength—violet is higher energy than blue, which is higher than green, etc.

The emitted energy is 2.3393 eV. Let me see what color that is. I remember that red is around 1.8-2.1 eV, orange is a bit higher, yellow around 2.1 or 2.2, maybe. Green is higher than that, around 2.3-2.5 eV perhaps. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting the numbers wrong. Let me think.

The energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ. So higher energy (E) means shorter wavelength (λ). The visible spectrum is approximately from 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). Let me calculate what 2.3393 eV corresponds to in wavelength.

The conversion factor is 1 eV ≈ 1240 eV·nm (since hc ≈ 1240 eV·nm). So λ = 1240 / E (in eV). So 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ let's calculate that.

1240 divided by 2.3393. Let me approximate. 2.3393 is about 2.34. 1240 / 2.34 is approximately 529.9 nm. Wait, wait, because 2.34 times 529 is about 1240. Because 2.34 * 500 is 1170, 2.34 * 30 is 70.2, so 530 would be 2.34 *530= 1240.2. So λ≈530 nm.

530 nm is in the green region of the spectrum. Because violet is about 400-450, blue about 450-500, green 500-570, yellow 570-600, orange 600-630, red 630-700. So 530 is green. Wait, but wait that can't be right because the emitted light is at 530 nm (green), so the absorbed light must be higher energy, which would be shorter wavelength, so blue or violet.

Wait, but the question is about the color absorbed. The dye emits green light, which is 530 nm. Therefore, it must have absorbed higher energy light. So what color is higher in energy than green? Blue is about 450-500, so higher than 530. Wait, no, 530 is green, so blue is 450-500, which is higher energy than green. Wait, but the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV which is around 530 nm, so the absorbed light must have higher energy than that, because the energy difference is the emission. So absorbed energy is higher than 2.3393 eV. So the wavelength of the absorbed light would be less than 530 nm.

So what color is that? Less than 530 nm is blue (450-500) or violet (400-450). But wait, the question is which color is absorbed.

Wait, the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, so the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than that. Because when the molecule absorbs a photon, it excites an electron to a higher energy state. When the electron drops back, it emits a photon with energy equal to the energy difference.

Wait, no, the energy of the emitted photon is the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state. So the energy of the absorbed photon is equal to that emission energy plus any other energy losses, but for conjugated systems, the main transition is that the energy absorbed is approximately the same as the energy emitted, but maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no. Wait, absorption and emission are inverse processes. So when the molecule absorbs a photon of energy E_abs, the electron jumps from a lower energy level to a higher one. Then, when it drops back, it emits a photon of energy E_emit. But E_abs is equal to E_emit in a simple two-level system because the energy difference is the same. So if the molecule absorbs a photon of energy E, it emits a photon of energy E when it relaxes. But wait, that's not correct in reality because there are other factors like thermal energy and other transitions, but in conjugated systems, the main transition is the one that's considered.

So in this case, if the dye emits light at 2.3393 eV, then the energy absorbed should be around the same. But wait, that can't be right because the question is asking which color is absorbed. So if the emitted is green (530 nm), the absorbed would also be green, but that's not matching the options. Or am I mixing up something here?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think again. The energy levels in the molecule have a certain HOMO and LUMO. When the molecule absorbs a photon, the electron jumps from HOMO to LUMO. The energy of the photon is equal to the energy difference between HOMO and LUMO. Then, when the electron drops back, the molecule emits a photon of the same energy (if it's a simple transition), but maybe in some cases, it emits at a lower energy, but that's not usually the case.

Wait, no. In fluorescence, the emitted photon usually has lower energy than the absorbed one because some energy is lost as heat during the transition. So the energy of the emitted photon is less than the absorbed one. So the energy of emission is less than absorption.

Ah, so that's the key. So the energy of the emitted photon is E_emit = E_abs - Δ, where Δ is the energy lost as heat. So E_emit < E_abs. Therefore, the absorbed photon's energy is higher than the emitted photon.

So in this case, E_emit is 2.3393 eV. Therefore, E_abs must be higher than that. So the absorbed photon is higher in energy than 2.3393 eV, which corresponds to a wavelength shorter than 530 nm.

So the color absorbed is in the blue or violet range. Let's calculate the wavelength of 2.3393 eV. I did that earlier and got about 530 nm, which is green. So the absorbed photon must be higher energy than 2.3393 eV, so wavelength less than 530 nm.

What color is 450 nm? Blue. 400 nm is violet. So the absorbed light is either blue or violet. The options are: A) Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow.

So the possible options are B or C.

Wait, the question is asking what color is absorbed. If the emitted is green (530 nm), the absorbed must be higher energy, which is blue or violet.

Now, the question is, which color is absorbed? The options are Violet, Blue, etc.

So the possible correct answers are B or C.

But wait, what's the typical absorption for dyes? Dyes often absorb in the blue/violet region to emit in the complementary color. For example, a red dye might absorb blue light and emit red. Because blue and red are complementary colors.

Wait, wait, complementary colors. The color wheel: red and green are not complementary. Wait, no, the complementary colors are the ones opposite each other. So red's complement is cyan (blue-green), and blue's complement is orange. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of color addition.

In RGB color model, each color's complementary is the mixture that makes white. So red's complement is cyan (blue+green), blue's complement is yellow (red+green), and green's complement is magenta (red+blue). Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable.

Alternatively, in terms of light absorption: if a dye emits red light, it must have absorbed higher energy (blue or violet) because red is lower energy. So in this case, the dye emits green, which is around 530 nm. So the absorbed light must be higher energy than green, which is blue or violet.

So looking at the options, the absorbed color is either violet (B) or blue (C). So which one is it?

The energy emitted is 2.3393 eV. The energy difference between the absorbed and emitted is the energy loss as heat. So, the absorbed photon is more energetic than 2.3393 eV. So the wavelength is shorter than 530 nm.

So what is 2.3393 eV in terms of color? Let me think about known colors. 2.3 eV is approximately green. 2.5 eV is blue. So if the emitted is green, the absorbed would be blue or violet.

Wait, another approach: the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than the emitted. So the absorbed photon is higher in energy, meaning a shorter wavelength. So if the emitted is green (530 nm), the absorbed must be in the blue or violet range, which are shorter wavelengths.

So the options are B) Violet or C) Blue.

But how to choose between them. Let me calculate the exact energy for each color to see where 2.3393 eV falls.

Wait, I think 2.3393 eV is approximately 530 nm. Which is green. So the absorbed photon must be higher than that, so either blue (around 450-500 nm, which is 2.48 to about 2.75 eV) or violet (400-450 nm, about 2.75-3.1 eV).

So the question is, which color is the absorbed one. The options are violet or blue.

But wait, the question says the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. So what color is that? 530 nm is green. So the dye emits green. So the absorbed color would be the one that's higher in energy, so blue or violet.

So which one is it? Hmm. Let's think about common dyes. For example, if a dye emits green, it would have absorbed blue or violet. But I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, perhaps the energy is in the range of blue emission. Wait, no—because the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV, which is about 530 nm, which is green. So the absorbed photon is higher than that.

Wait, perhaps another way: the energy of visible colors in eV.

Red: ~1.6-2.1 eV

Orange: ~2.1-2.4 eV

Yellow: ~2.4-2.5 eV

Green: ~2.5-2.7 eV

Blue: ~2.7-3.0 eV

Violet: ~3.0-3.3 eV

Wait, so 2.3393 eV is in the orange range, not green. Because green is higher than that.

Wait, wait a minute, that doesn't make sense. Let me double-check. The energy and wavelengths:

Wavelength (nm) | Color | Energy (eV)
400-440 | Violet | ~2.77-3.10
440-495 | Blue | ~2.48-2.77
495-570 | Green | ~2.17-2.48
570-590 | Yellow | ~2.10-2.17
590-620 | Orange | ~1.98-2.10
620-750 | Red | ~1.65-1.98

So 2.3393 eV is between 2.17 and 2.48 eV. That's in the green range (495-570 nm). So 2.3393 eV is about 530 nm, which is green.

So if the dye emits green, the absorbed photon is higher energy, which is blue or violet.

But in the options, the available colors are A) Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow.

So the absorbed color is either B or C.

Wait, the question is specifically about an extensively conjugated pi-electrons. Extensive conjugation implies that the energy gap is smaller, so the absorbed photon would have lower energy. Wait, no. Extensive conjugation leads to longer wavelengths (lower energy) being absorbed because the HOMO-LUMO gap decreases. So more conjugation leads to lower energy absorption (red shift). So if the conjugation is extensive, the molecule absorbs lower energy (longer wavelength) light.

Wait, but in this case, the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, which is green. So the absorbed photon must be higher energy, so the molecule must have a HOMO-LUMO gap larger than 2.3393 eV. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, when a molecule has a larger HOMO-LUMO gap, it absorbs higher energy (shorter wavelength) light. So if the molecule has an extensive conjugation, the HOMO-LUMO gap is smaller, so it absorbs lower energy (longer wavelength) light.

So in this case, the dye emits at 2.3393 eV (green). So the HOMO-LUMO gap must be that energy or higher. Because the energy of the absorbed photon is the HOMO-LUMO gap.

Wait, but wait, when the molecule absorbs a photon, the energy of the photon must be at least equal to the HOMO-LUMO gap. So E_photon >= E_gap.

But the emitted photon's energy is the HOMO-LUMO gap. Because when the electron drops back, it emits that energy. So if the HOMO-LUMO gap is E, then the absorbed photon must have energy E, and the emitted photon also has energy E. But that would be the case in a simple two-level system. But in reality, some energy is lost as heat, so the emitted photon is lower in energy than the absorbed.

Wait, now I'm getting even more confused. Let's think of it this way: the molecule must absorb a photon of energy E_abs to get excited. Then, upon relaxation, it emits a photon of energy E_emit, which is less than E_abs. So E_abs = E_emit + heat.

So the question is, E_emit is 2.3393 eV. So E_abs must be higher than that. So E_abs is greater than 2.3393 eV, which corresponds to a wavelength shorter than 530 nm.

So the absorbed light is blue or violet. From the options, B is violet and C is blue.

So which one is it?

Well, the energy 2.3393 eV is green. The absorbed energy must be higher, so let's see:

E_abs = E_emit + heat. Since heat loss is small, E_abs is just a bit higher than E_emit. So if the dye is emitting green (2.3393 eV), the absorbed photon is likely blue (around 2.7 eV), which is in the blue region.

Alternatively, if the energy is much higher, it would be violet. But for conjugated systems, the HOMO-LUMO gap is typically in the visible range. So what's the typical HOMO-LUMO gap for a conjugated dye?

For example, many dyes have their absorption in the visible range. Let's think of some examples.

Copper phthalocyanine absorbs in the near-infrared, but that's a different case. Common organic dyes like methylene blue absorb in the visible. For example, methylene blue has an absorption maximum around 668 nm (which is red), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's around 600 nm.

Wait, but in this question, the emission is green. So if the molecule emits green, it must have absorbed a higher energy photon, perhaps blue.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the exact possible colors.

If E_emit = 2.3393 eV, then the absorbed energy is higher, say 2.4 eV (which is about 516 nm, which is green), but that's lower than 2.3393? Wait, no, 2.4 eV is higher than 2.3393 eV. Because 2.4 > 2.3393.

Wait, let me compute 1240/2.4 eV. 1240 /2.4 is approximately 516.666... nm, which is in the green range. Wait, that's lower wavelength (higher energy) than 530 nm. So E=2.4 eV is higher than 2.3393 eV, which is correct.

So the absorbed photon is 2.4 eV, which is about 516 nm, which is green. But that's not one of the options. The options are violet, blue, etc.

Wait, perhaps the exact calculation would clarify.

But wait, the question is about the color absorbed. So if the dye emits green, which is 2.3393 eV, then the absorbed light must have higher energy. So the possible absorbed colors are blue (around 2.7 eV) or violet (3 eV).

Wait, but 2.3393 eV is about 530 nm. So the absorbed photon would be in the blue (450-500 nm, 2.4-2.75 eV) or violet (400-450 nm, 2.75-3.1 eV).

So the question is, which is it?

Looking back at the options, the choices are Violet, Blue, etc.

Well, without knowing the exact energy, perhaps the given energy 2.3393 eV is in the green. So the absorbed photon is blue or violet. Which of these is present in the options? Both B and C are present.

But wait, the question is about the color absorbed. If the molecule emits green, it must have absorbed a photon of higher energy, which is blue or violet.

But I'm not exactly sure which one. Alternatively, perhaps the energy corresponds to blue.

Wait, another thought: the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. The energy of the absorbed photon is higher. So the absorbed photon's wavelength is shorter than 530 nm. So, what about 450 nm (blue)?

450 nm: E = 1240 /450 ≈ 2.755 eV.

That's higher than 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed photon is blue (450 nm).

So the answer would be C) Blue.

But earlier, I thought 2.3393 eV is green, so the absorbed is blue. Hence, the color absorbed is blue.

Alternatively, if the absorption is at 400 nm (violet), E=3.1 eV, which is much higher. But the question is about which color is absorbed, so blue is a possibility.

Alternatively, perhaps the color is violet. Wait, but 2.3393 eV is green, and the absorbed is blue, which is close.

Wait, but wait, another approach—remembering that when a substance emits light, it's the complementary color of what it absorbed. So if the substance emits green, it absorbed the complementary color of green. The complementary color of green is magenta, which is a combination of red and blue. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, in terms of the color wheel, the complementary color of green is magenta. But that's not an option here.

Wait, perhaps the question is tricking me. Because if the molecule emits green, the absorbed is blue. Or perhaps it's the other way around.

Wait, no, the absorption and emission are not necessarily complementary. For example, a red dye may absorb blue and emit red.

Wait, let me think of a fluorescent highlighter. The yellow highlighter marker has a green fluorescence. So when you shine blue light (around 450 nm) on it, it absorbs blue and emits green. So the absorbed is blue, the emitted is green.

So in that case, the answer would be blue. So the dye in the question emits green, so it must absorb blue.

Therefore, the answer is C) Blue.

To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we start by analyzing the energy of the emitted light, which is given as 2.3393 eV. The energy of a photon is related to its wavelength by the equation:

\[
E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]

where \( E \) is the energy, \( h \) is Planck's constant, \( c \) is the speed of light, and \( \lambda \) is the wavelength. Using the conversion factor \( 1 \, \text{eV} \approx 1240 \, \text{eV·nm} \), the wavelength corresponding to 2.3393 eV can be calculated as:

\[
\lambda = \frac{1240}{2.3393} \approx 530 \, \text{nm}.
\]

A wavelength of 530 nm corresponds to green light. Therefore, the dye emits green light.

In fluorescence, the energy of the absorbed photon is typically higher than the energy of the emitted photon because some energy is lost as heat during the transition. Since the emitted photon has an energy of 2.3393 eV, the absorbed photon must have a higher energy, corresponding to a shorter wavelength.

The visible spectrum ranges from 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red), with energy inversely related to wavelength. Higher energy photons correspond to shorter wavelengths (e.g., violet and blue), while lower energy photons correspond to longer wavelengths (e.g., green, yellow, and red). Since the emitted light is green (530 nm), the absorbed light must be in the higher energy range, corresponding to blue (450–500 nm) or violet (400–450 nm).

To determine whether the absorbed light is blue or violet, we consider the energy gap. The energy of the emitted photon (2.3393 eV) is close to the energy of blue light (approximately 2.4–2.75 eV). Given that the energy difference between the absorbed and emitted photons is small, the absorbed photon is likely blue rather than violet, which would require a much higher energy (3.0–3.3 eV).

Thus, the dye absorbs blue light and emits green light.

**Analysis of options:**
- **A) Red:** Red light has a lower energy (1.6–2.1 eV) and longer wavelength (620–750 nm), so it cannot be the absorbed light.
- **B) Violet:** Violet light has a higher energy (3.0–3.3 eV) and shorter wavelength (400–450 nm). While it is a possible candidate, the energy gap suggests the absorbed light is more likely blue.
- **C) Blue:** Blue light has a higher energy (2.4–2.75 eV) and shorter wavelength (450–500 nm), making it the most likely absorbed light.
- **D) Yellow:** Yellow light has a lower energy (2.1–2.4 eV) and longer wavelength (570–590 nm), so it cannot be the absorbed light.

Based on the energy considerations and the typical behavior of conjugated systems, the absorbed light is blue.

Okay, so I have this question about a textile dye and the light it emits. Hmm, I remember from my chemistry classes that when something emits light, it's because it's releasing energy.

So the energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV. Therefore, the absorbed photon must have higher energy. So I need to find the color corresponding to a photon with higher energy than 2.3393 eV.

I remember the visible spectrum goes from violet (highest energy, about 3 eV) to red (lower energy, around 1.6 eV). So if the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV, the absorbed energy must be higher than that. Let me think about the order: higher energy photons are at the blue/violet end.

The energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ. So higher energy (E) means shorter wavelength (λ). The visible spectrum is approximately from 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). Let me calculate what 2.3393 eV corresponds to in wavelength.

The conversion factor is 1 eV ≈ 1240 eV·nm (since hc ≈ 1240 eV·nm). So λ = 1240 / E (in eV). So 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ let's calculate that.

1240 divided by 2.3393. Let me approximate. 2.3393 is about 2.34. 1240 / 2.34 is approximately 529.9 nm. Wait, wait, because 2.34 times 529 is about 1240. Because 2.34 * 500 is 1170, 2.34 * 30 is 70.2, so 530 would be 2.34 *530= 1240.2. So λ≈530 nm.

530 nm is in the green region of the spectrum. Because violet is about 400-450, blue about 450-500, green 500-570, yellow 570-600, orange 600-630, red 630-700. So 530 is green. Wait, but wait that can't be right because the emitted light is at 530 nm (green), so the absorbed light must be higher energy, which would be shorter wavelength, so blue or violet.

Wait, but the question is about the color absorbed. The dye emits green light, which is 530 nm. Therefore, it must have absorbed higher energy light. So what color is higher in energy than green? Blue is about 450-500, so higher than 530. Wait, no, 530 is green, so blue is 450-500, which is higher energy than green. Wait, but the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV which is around 530 nm, so the absorbed light must have higher energy than that, because the energy difference is the emission. So absorbed energy is higher than 2.3393 eV. So the wavelength of the absorbed light would be less than 530 nm.

So what color is that? Less than 530 nm is blue (450-500) or violet (400-450). But wait, the question is which color is absorbed.

Wait, the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, so the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than that. Because when the molecule absorbs a photon, it excites an electron to a higher energy state. When the electron drops back, it emits a photon with energy equal to the energy difference.

So the energy of the absorbed photon is equal to that emission energy plus any other energy losses, but for conjugated systems, the main transition is that the energy absorbed is approximately the same as the energy emitted, but maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no. Wait, absorption and emission are inverse processes. So when the molecule absorbs a photon of energy E_abs, the electron jumps from a lower energy level to a higher one. Then, when it drops back, it emits a photon of energy E_emit. But E_abs is equal to E_emit in a simple two-level system because the energy difference is the same. So if the molecule absorbs a photon of energy E, it emits a photon of energy E when it relaxes. But wait, that's not correct in reality because there are other factors like thermal energy and other transitions, but in conjugated systems, the main transition is the one that's considered.

Wait, no. In fluorescence, the emitted photon usually has lower energy than the absorbed one because some energy is lost as heat during the transition. So the energy of the emitted photon is less than the absorbed one. So the energy of emission is less than absorption.

Ah, so that's the key. So the energy of the emitted photon is E_emit = E_abs - Δ, where Δ is the energy lost as heat. So E_emit < E_abs. Therefore, the absorbed photon's energy is higher than the emitted photon.

So in this case, E_emit is 2.3393 eV. Therefore, E_abs must be higher than that. So the absorbed photon is higher in energy than 2.3393 eV, which corresponds to a wavelength shorter than 530 nm.

What color is 450 nm? Blue. 400 nm is violet. So the absorbed light is either blue or violet. The options are: A) Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow.

So the possible options are B or C.

Wait, the question is asking what color is absorbed. If the emitted is green (530 nm), the absorbed must be higher energy, which is blue or violet.

Now, the question is, which color is absorbed? The options are Violet, Blue, etc.

So the possible correct answers are B or C.

But wait, what's the typical absorption for dyes? Dyes often absorb in the blue/violet region to emit in the complementary color. For example, a red dye might absorb blue light and emit red. Because blue and red are complementary colors.

Wait, wait, complementary colors. The color wheel: red and green are not complementary. Wait, no, the complementary colors are the ones opposite each other. So red's complement is cyan (blue-green), and blue's complement is orange. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of color addition.

In RGB color model, each color's complementary is the mixture that makes white. So red's complement is cyan (blue+green), blue's complement is yellow (red+green), and green's complement is magenta (red+blue). Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable.

Alternatively, in terms of light absorption: if a dye emits red light, it must have absorbed higher energy (blue or violet) because red is lower energy. So in this case, the dye emits green, which is around 530 nm. So the absorbed light must be higher energy than green, which is blue or violet.

So looking at the options, the absorbed color is either violet (B) or blue (C). So which one is it?

The energy emitted is 2.3393 eV. The energy difference between the absorbed and emitted is the energy loss as heat. So, the absorbed photon is more energetic than 2.3393 eV. So the wavelength is shorter than 530 nm.

So what is 2.3393 eV in terms of color? Let me think about known colors. 2.3 eV is approximately green. 2.5 eV is blue. So if the emitted is green, the absorbed would be blue or violet.

Wait, another approach: the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than the emitted. So the absorbed photon is higher in energy, meaning a shorter wavelength. So if the emitted is green (530 nm), the absorbed must be in the blue or violet range, which are shorter wavelengths.

So the options are B) Violet or C) Blue.

But how to choose between them. Let me calculate the exact energy for each color to see where 2.3393 eV falls.

Wait, I think 2.3393 eV is approximately 530 nm. Which is green. So the absorbed photon must be higher than that, so either blue (around 450-500 nm, which is 2.48 to about 2.75 eV) or violet (400-450 nm, about 2.75-3.1 eV).

So the question is, which color is the absorbed one. The options are violet or blue.

But wait, the question says the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. So what color is that? 530 nm is green. So the dye emits green. So the absorbed color would be the one that's higher in energy, so blue or violet.

So which one is it? Hmm. Let's think about common dyes. For example, if a dye emits green, it would have absorbed blue or violet. But I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, perhaps the energy is in the range of blue emission. Wait, no—because the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV, which is about 530 nm, which is green. So the absorbed photon is higher than that.

Wait, perhaps another way: the energy of visible colors in eV.

Red: ~1.6-2.1 eV

Orange: ~2.1-2.4 eV

Yellow: ~2.4-2.5 eV

Green: ~2.5-2.7 eV

Blue: ~2.7-3.0 eV

Violet: ~3.0-3.3 eV

Wait, so 2.3393 eV is in the orange range, not green. Because green is higher than that.

Wait, wait a minute, that doesn't make sense. Let me double-check. The energy and wavelengths:

Wavelength (nm) | Color | Energy (eV)
400-440 | Violet | ~2.77-3.10
440-495 | Blue | ~2.48-2.77
495-570 | Green | ~2.17-2.48
570-590 | Yellow | ~2.10-2.17
590-620 | Orange | ~1.98-2.10
620-750 | Red | ~1.65-1.98

So 2.3393 eV is between 2.17 and 2.48 eV. That's in the green range (495-570 nm). So 2.3393 eV is about 530 nm, which is green.

So if the dye emits green, the absorbed photon is higher energy, which is blue or violet.

But in the options, the available colors are A) Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow.

So the absorbed color is either B or C.

Wait, the question is specifically about an extensively conjugated pi-electrons. Extensive conjugation implies that the energy gap is smaller, so the absorbed photon would have lower energy. Wait, no. Extensive conjugation leads to longer wavelengths (lower energy) being absorbed because the HOMO-LUMO gap decreases. So more conjugation leads to lower energy absorption (red shift). So if the conjugation is extensive, the molecule absorbs lower energy (longer wavelength) light.

Wait, but in this case, the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, which is green. So the absorbed photon must be higher energy, so the molecule must have a HOMO-LUMO gap larger than 2.3393 eV. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, when a molecule has a larger HOMO-LUMO gap, it absorbs higher energy (shorter wavelength) light. So if the molecule has an extensive conjugation, the HOMO-LUMO gap is smaller, so it absorbs lower energy (longer wavelength) light.

So in this case, the dye emits at 2.3393 eV (green). So the HOMO-LUMO gap must be that energy or higher. Because the energy of the absorbed photon is the HOMO-LUMO gap.

Wait, but wait, when the molecule absorbs a photon, the energy of the photon must be at least equal to the HOMO-LUMO gap. So E_photon >= E_gap.

But the emitted photon's energy is the HOMO-LUMO gap. Because when the electron drops back, it emits that energy. So if the HOMO-LUMO gap is E, then the absorbed photon must have energy E, and the emitted photon also has energy E. But that would be the case in a simple two-level system. But in reality, some energy is lost as heat, so the emitted photon is lower in energy than the absorbed.

Wait, now I'm getting even more confused. Let's think of it this way: the molecule must absorb a photon of energy E_abs to get excited. Then, upon relaxation, it emits a photon of energy E_emit, which is less than E_abs. So E_abs = E_emit + heat.

So the question is, E_emit is 2.3393 eV. So E_abs must be higher than that. So E_abs is greater than 2.3393 eV, which corresponds to a wavelength shorter than 530 nm.

So the absorbed light is blue or violet. From the options, B is violet and C is blue.

So which one is it?

Well, the energy 2.3393 eV is green. The absorbed energy must be higher, so let's see:

E_abs = E_emit + heat. Since heat loss is small, E_abs is just a bit higher than E_emit. So if the dye is emitting green (2.3393 eV), the absorbed photon is likely blue (around 2.7 eV), which is in the blue region.

Alternatively, if the energy is much higher, it would be violet. But for conjugated systems, the HOMO-LUMO gap is typically in the visible range. So what's the typical HOMO-LUMO gap for a conjugated dye?

For example, many dyes have their absorption in the visible range. Let's think of some examples.

Copper phthalocyanine absorbs in the near-infrared, but that's a different case. Common organic dyes like methylene blue absorb in the visible. For example, methylene blue has an absorption maximum around 668 nm (which is red), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's around 600 nm.

Wait, but in this question, the emission is green. So if the molecule emits green, it must have absorbed a higher energy photon, perhaps blue.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the exact possible colors.

If E_emit = 2.3393 eV, then the absorbed energy is higher, say 2.4 eV (which is about 516 nm, which is green), but that's lower than 2.3393? Wait, no, 2.4 eV is higher than 2.3393 eV. Because 2.4 > 2.3393.

Wait, let me compute 1240/2.4 eV. 1240 /2.4 is approximately 516.666... nm, which is in the green range. Wait, that's lower wavelength (higher energy) than 530 nm. So E=2.4 eV is higher than 2.3393 eV, which is correct.

So the absorbed photon is 2.4 eV, which is about 516 nm, which is green. But that's not one of the options. The options are violet, blue, etc.

Wait, perhaps the exact calculation would clarify.

But wait, the question is about the color absorbed. So if the dye emits green, which is 2.3393 eV, then the absorbed light must have higher energy. So the possible absorbed colors are blue (around 2.7 eV) or violet (3 eV).

Wait, but 2.3393 eV is about 530 nm. So the absorbed photon would be in the blue (450-500 nm, 2.4-2.75 eV) or violet (400-450 nm, 2.75-3.1 eV).

So the question is, which is it?

Looking back at the options, the choices are Violet, Blue, etc.

Well, without knowing the exact energy, perhaps the given energy 2.3393 eV is in the green. So the absorbed photon is blue or violet. Which of these is present in the options? Both B and C are present.

But wait, the question is about the color absorbed. If the molecule emits green, it must have absorbed a photon of higher energy, which is blue or violet.

But I'm not exactly sure which one. Alternatively, perhaps the energy corresponds to blue.

Wait, another thought: the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. The energy of the absorbed photon is higher. So the absorbed photon's wavelength is shorter than 530 nm. So, what about 450 nm (blue)?

450 nm: E = 1240 /450 ≈ 2.755 eV.

That's higher than 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed photon is blue (450 nm).

So the answer would be C) Blue.

But earlier, I thought 2.3393 eV is green, so the absorbed is blue. Hence, the color absorbed is blue.

Alternatively, if the absorption is at 400 nm (violet), E=3.1 eV, which is much higher. But the question is about which color is absorbed, so blue is a possibility.

Alternatively, perhaps the color is violet. Wait, but 2.3393 eV is green, and the absorbed is blue, which is close.

Wait, but wait, another approach—remembering that when a substance emits light, it's the complementary color of what it absorbed. So if the substance emits green, it absorbed the complementary color of green. The complementary color of green is magenta, which is a combination of red and blue. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, in terms of the color wheel, the complementary color of green is magenta. But that's not an option here.

Wait, perhaps the question is tricking me. Because if the molecule emits green, the absorbed is blue. Or perhaps it's the other way around.

Wait, no, the absorption and emission are not necessarily complementary. For example, a red dye may absorb blue and emit red.

Wait, let me think of a fluorescent highlighter. The yellow highlighter marker has a green fluorescence. So when you shine blue light (around 450 nm) on it, it absorbs blue and emits green. So the absorbed is blue, the emitted is green.

So in that case, the answer would be blue. So the dye in the question emits green, so it must absorb blue.

Therefore, the answer is C) Blue.


To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we start by analyzing the energy of the emitted light, which is given as 2.3393 eV. The energy of a photon is related to its wavelength by the equation:

\[
E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]

where \( E \) is the energy, \( h \) is Planck's constant, \( c \) is the speed of light, and \( \lambda \) is the wavelength. Using the conversion factor \( 1 \, \text{eV} \approx 1240 \, \text{eV·nm} \), the wavelength corresponding to 2.3393 eV can be calculated as:

\[
\lambda = \frac{1240}{2.3393} \approx 530 \, \text{nm}.
\]

A wavelength of 530 nm corresponds to green light. Therefore, the dye emits green light.

In fluorescence, the energy of the absorbed photon is typically higher than the energy of the emitted photon because some energy is lost as heat during the transition. Since the emitted photon has an energy of 2.3393 eV, the absorbed photon must have a higher energy, corresponding to a shorter wavelength.

The visible spectrum ranges from 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red), with energy inversely related to wavelength. Higher energy photons correspond to shorter wavelengths (e.g., violet and blue), while lower energy photons correspond to longer wavelengths (e.g., green, yellow, and red). Since the emitted light is green (530 nm), the absorbed light must be in the higher energy range, corresponding to blue (450–500 nm) or violet (400–450 nm).

To determine whether the absorbed light is blue or violet, we consider the energy gap. The energy of the emitted photon (2.3393 eV) is close to the energy of blue light (approximately 2.4–2.75 eV). Given that the energy difference between the absorbed and emitted photons is small, the absorbed photon is likely blue rather than violet, which would require a much higher energy (3.0–3.3 eV).

Thus, the dye absorbs blue light and emits green light.

**Analysis of options:**
- **A) Red:** Red light has a lower energy (1.6–2.1 eV) and longer wavelength (620–750 nm), so it cannot be the absorbed light.
- **B) Violet:** Violet light has a higher energy (3.0–3.3 eV) and shorter wavelength (400–450 nm). While it is a possible candidate, the energy gap suggests the absorbed light is more likely blue.
- **C) Blue:** Blue light has a higher energy (2.4–2.75 eV) and shorter wavelength (450–500 nm), making it the most likely absorbed light.
- **D) Yellow:** Yellow light has a lower energy (2.1–2.4 eV) and longer wavelength (570–590 nm), so it cannot be the absorbed light.

Based on the energy considerations and the typical behavior of conjugated systems, the absorbed light is blue.

**Answer: C**
