Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The operator is P, and I need to find its eigenvector along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators like angular momentum can have eigenvalues associated with their components. But wait, the direction here is arbitrary, so this might not be as straightforward as the standard x, y, or z components.

Let me break down what I know. The operator P has components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. The given matrices are:

Px: (0 1; 1 0)
Py: (0 -i; i 0)
Pz: (1 0; 0 -1)

Wait, so I think these are the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Because the Pauli matrices have the same structure. Yeah, so Px is (ħ/2) * σx, Py is (ħ/2) * σy, and Pz is (ħ/2) * σz.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector for the operator in the direction n, which lies in the x-z plane. So n would be making some angle θ with the z-axis, but in the x-z plane, so the direction can be described as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), maybe? Because in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero.

Wait, no. Wait, in spherical coordinates, n would have components (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But since it's in the x-z plane, φ is zero. So n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right? So the direction is in the x-z plane, making an angle θ with the z-axis.

The operator P in the direction n would be the vector sum of the components: P = n_x Px + n_y Py + n_z Pz. Since n is in x-z plane, n_y is zero, so P = n_x Px + n_z Pz.

Let me write that out. So substituting the components:

P = n_x*(ħ/2)*[[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z*(ħ/2)*[[1,0],[0,-1]]

So substituting n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ (since n is a unit vector), we get:

P = (ħ/2) [ [0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0] ] + (ħ/2) [ [cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ] ]

Adding these together, the matrix becomes:

(ħ/2) [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

So the operator P has this matrix representation.

Now, we're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Wait, that's interesting because the eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix are ±ħ/2. But wait, the operator is a combination of Pauli matrices, so its eigenvalues are ±(ħ/2) multiplied by the magnitude of the vector n, but since n is a unit vector, the magnitude is 1, so eigenvalues are ±ħ/2.

So the eigenvalue equation is:

P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Wait, but wait, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so:

P |ψ> = (+ħ/2) |ψ>

So we can set up the equation:

(ħ/2) [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] * |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Divide both sides by (ħ/2), and we get:

[ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] |ψ> = |ψ>

So the matrix equation is:

[cosθ  sinθ] [a]   [a]
[sinθ -cosθ] [b] = [b]

Which leads to the system of equations:

cosθ * a + sinθ * b = a
sinθ * a - cosθ * b = b

Let me write these out:

1) cosθ a + sinθ b = a → (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0
2) sinθ a - cosθ b = b → sinθ a - (cosθ + 1) b = 0

So we have two equations:

Equation 1: (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0
Equation 2: sinθ a - (cosθ + 1) b = 0

Hmm, perhaps I can solve these equations for a and b. Let me try to express them in terms of ratios.

From equation 1: (cosθ -1) a = - sinθ b → a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b

But wait, cosθ -1 is the same as -(1 - cosθ), so denominator becomes -(1 - cosθ). So:

a = [ - sinθ / (- (1 - cosθ) ) ] b = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ) ] b

Simplify that: sinθ/(1 - cosθ) can be multiplied numerator and denominator by (1 + cosθ) to rationalize.

Wait, sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)
1 - cosθ = 2 sin^2(theta/2)

So substituting:

a = [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) / (2 sin^2(theta/2)) ) ] b
Simplify numerator and denominator: 2 cancels, so [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ) ] = cot(theta/2)

So a = cot(theta/2) * b

So the ratio of a to b is cot(theta/2) → a = [cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)] * b

Alternatively, let me let b = 1 for simplicity, then a = cot(theta/2). But wait, when you're dealing with eigenvectors, the vector is determined up to a scalar multiple, so I can choose b = sin(theta/2), then a = cos(theta/2), perhaps? Hmm, maybe.

Wait, let's see. If a = cot(theta/2) * b, then I can write the eigenvector as [a; b] = [cot(theta/2) b; b] = b [cot(theta/2); 1]

But to make it normalized, I can factor out b as sqrt(1 + cot^2(theta/2)) ) times the components. Let me compute that.

cot^2(theta/2) + 1 = csc^2(theta/2) → 1/sin^2(theta/2). So sqrt(1 + cot^2(theta/2)) ) = 1/sin(theta/2)

So the normalized eigenvector would be [ cot(theta/2), 1 ] / sqrt(1 + cot^2(theta/2)) )

Which simplifies to [ cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ) ]

Because:

cot(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)

So:

[ (cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)) * sin(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] = [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

And the denominator is 1/sin(theta/2), so when you divide by it, you multiply by sin(theta/2). So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, that's interesting. So the eigenvector is ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )^T, and it's normalized because cos² + sin² = 1.

But wait, wait a second. Let me check if this satisfies equation 2.

Equation 2: sinθ a - (cosθ + 1) b =0

Substituting a = cos(theta/2), b = sin(theta/2):

sinθ * cos(theta/2) - (cosθ + 1) sin(theta/2) = 0?

Let me compute each term.

We know that sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)
Similarly, cosθ = 1 - 2 sin²(theta/2) [using the double-angle formula]

So substituting into equation 2:

[2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] * cos(theta/2) - [ (1 - 2 sin^2(theta/2)) +1 ] * sin(theta/2) 

Simplify each term:

First term: 2 sin(theta/2) cos^2(theta/2)
Second term: [2 - 2 sin^2(theta/2)] * sin(theta/2) = [2(1 - sin^2(theta/2))] * sin(theta/2) = 2 cos^2(theta/2) sin(theta/2)

So equation becomes:

2 sin(theta/2) cos^2(theta/2) - 2 cos^2(theta/2) sin(theta/2) = 0

Which is 0=0. So that's correct. So the eigenvector is indeed [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T, normalized.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C says (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches this. But wait, looking at the options again:

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

But wait, the problem says the operator is P along n, which is in x-z direction, so the eigenvector is in that direction. So in the spin-½ system, the eigenstate with eigenvalue +ħ/2 for the direction n would have the standard form (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2))^T. But in this problem, since the direction is in the x-z plane, phi is zero because n is along the x-z plane, so phi=0. So the second component would be sin(theta/2), not multiplied by e^{i phi}. So the eigenvector simplifies to (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Looking again at the options:

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta))—that doesn't seem right. Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches.

But wait, the eigenvector I found is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), and looking at the options, option C matches.

Wait, but the problem states that the eigenvector should be normalized. Let me check if [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)] is normalized. cos^2(theta/2) + sin^2(theta/2) = 1, so yes, it's already normalized.

So the correct answer should be option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but wait another thing. The problem says the operator is P along n, so the eigenvalue is (+ħ/2). But in my calculation, the eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

Looking at the options, option C is exactly that. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let's make sure. The possible options are:

Option A: (√(2/3)ħ, √(1/3)ħ) → but these are scalars, not in terms of theta; not sure.

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)) → this seems like spherical coordinates without the theta/2 angle.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)) → correct as per my calculation.

Option D: sqrt(2/3)ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3)ħ sin(theta/2) → Not sure about the factors.

Wait, but the answer should have factors of ħ? Or no? Wait, the eigenvector shouldn't have ħ in it. Because ħ is part of the operator, but the eigenvector is a vector of coefficients, which are dimensionless. So in the options, options A and D include ħ; that's probably a mistake because eigenvectors are vectors in Hilbert space, so their components shouldn't have units like ħ. So options A and D are probably incorrect because they include ħ. So only options B and C are left.

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), but for our problem, phi is zero, so it's (cos(theta), sin(theta)). But according to our solution, it's (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is option C.

So the correct answer must be option C.

To solve the problem, we need to find the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$ for an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane. The operator $\vec{P}$ is defined in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices. The direction $\vec{n}$ is given as $(\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$ since it lies in the x-z plane.

### Step 1: Constructing the operator $\vec{P}$
The operator $\vec{P}$ in the direction $\vec{n}$ is expressed as:
\[
\vec{P} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z
\]
Substituting $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$, and using the given matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$, the matrix representation of $\vec{P}$ becomes:
\[
\vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} 
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos\theta & \sin\theta \\
\sin\theta & -\cos\theta
\end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 2: Eigenvalue equation
The eigenvalue equation is:
\[
\vec{P} | \psi \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} | \psi \rangle
\]
Dividing through by $\frac{\hbar}{2}$, we get:
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos\theta & \sin\theta \\
\sin\theta & -\cos\theta
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
a \\
b
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
a \\
b
\end{bmatrix}
\]
This leads to the system of equations:
\[
\cos\theta a + \sin\theta b = a, \quad \sin\theta a - \cos\theta b = b
\]

### Step 3: Solving for $a$ and $b$
From the first equation:
\[
(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0 \implies a = \frac{\sin\theta}{1 - \cos\theta} b
\]
Using trigonometric identities, $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$ and $1 - \cos\theta = 2\sin^2(\theta/2)$, we simplify:
\[
a = \frac{\cos(\theta/2)}{\sin(\theta/2)} b = \cot(\theta/2) b
\]
Thus, the eigenvector can be written as:
\[
| \psi \rangle = b \begin{bmatrix}
\cot(\theta/2) \\
1
\end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 4: Normalization
To normalize the eigenvector, we compute the normalization factor:
\[
\sqrt{\cot^2(\theta/2) + 1} = \sqrt{\csc^2(\theta/2)} = \frac{1}{\sin(\theta/2)}
\]
The normalized eigenvector is:
\[
| \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix}
\cos(\theta/2) \\
\sin(\theta/2)
\end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 5: Analyzing the options
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$ includes $\hbar$, which is incorrect for eigenvector components.
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$ does not match the derived eigenvector, as it uses $\theta$ instead of $\theta/2$.
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$ matches the derived normalized eigenvector.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$ includes incorrect normalization factors and $\hbar$.

The correct answer is **Option C**, as it matches the normalized eigenvector derived from the eigenvalue equation.

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The operator is P, and I need to find its eigenvector along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators like angular momentum can have eigenvalues associated with their components. But wait, the direction here is arbitrary, so this might not be as straightforward as the standard x, y, or z components.

Let me break down what I know. The operator P has components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. The given matrices are:

Px: (0 1; 1 0)
Py: (0 -i; i 0)
Pz: (1 0; 0 -1)

Wait, so I think these are the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Because the Pauli matrices have the same structure. Yeah, so Px is (ħ/2) * σx, Py is (ħ/2) * σy, and Pz is (ħ/2) * σz.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector for the operator in the direction n, which lies in the x-z plane. So n would be making some angle θ with the z-axis, but in the x-z plane, so the direction can be described as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), maybe? Because in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero.

Wait, no. Wait, in spherical coordinates, n would have components (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But since it's in the x-z plane, φ is zero. So n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right? So the direction is in the x-z plane, making an angle θ with the z-axis.

The operator P in the direction n would be the vector sum of the components: P = n_x Px + n_y Py + n_z Pz. Since n is in x-z plane, n_y is zero, so P = n_x Px + n_z Pz.

Let me write that out. So substituting the components:

P = n_x*(ħ/2)*[[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z*(ħ/2)*[[1,0],[0,-1]]

So substituting n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ (since n is a unit vector), we get:

P = (ħ/2) [ [0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0] ] + (ħ/2) [ [cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ] ]

Adding these together, the matrix becomes:

(ħ/2) [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

So the operator P has this matrix representation.

Now, we're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Wait, that's interesting because the eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix are ±ħ/2. But wait, the operator is a combination of Pauli matrices, so its eigenvalues are ±(ħ/2) multiplied by the magnitude of the vector n, but since n is a unit vector, the magnitude is 1, so eigenvalues are ±ħ/2.

So the eigenvalue equation is:

P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Wait, but wait, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so:

P |ψ> = (+ħ/2) |ψ>

So we can set up the equation:

(ħ/2) [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] * |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Divide both sides by (ħ/2), and we get:

[ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] |ψ> = |ψ>

So the matrix equation is:

[cosθ  sinθ] [a]   [a]
[sinθ -cosθ] [b] = [b]

Which leads to the system of equations:

cosθ * a + sinθ * b = a
sinθ * a - cosθ * b = b

Let me write these out:

1) cosθ a + sinθ b = a → (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0
2) sinθ a - cosθ b = b → sinθ a - (cosθ + 1) b = 0

So we have two equations:

Equation 1: (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0
Equation 2: sinθ a - (cosθ + 1) b = 0

Hmm, perhaps I can solve these equations for a and b. Let me try to express them in terms of ratios.

From equation 1: (cosθ -1) a = - sinθ b → a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b

But wait, cosθ -1 is the same as -(1 - cosθ), so denominator becomes -(1 - cosθ). So:

a = [ - sinθ / (- (1 - cosθ) ) ] b = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ) ] b

Simplify that: sinθ/(1 - cosθ) can be multiplied numerator and denominator by (1 + cosθ) to rationalize.

Wait, sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)
1 - cosθ = 2 sin^2(theta/2)

So substituting:

a = [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) / (2 sin^2(theta/2)) ) ] b
Simplify numerator and denominator: 2 cancels, so [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ) ] = cot(theta/2)

So a = cot(theta/2) * b

So the ratio of a to b is cot(theta/2) → a = [cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)] * b

Alternatively, let me let b = 1 for simplicity, then a = cot(theta/2). But wait, when you're dealing with eigenvectors, the vector is determined up to a scalar multiple, so I can choose b = sin(theta/2), then a = cos(theta/2), perhaps? Hmm, maybe.

Wait, let's see. If a = cot(theta/2) * b, then I can write the eigenvector as [a; b] = [cot(theta/2) b; b] = b [cot(theta/2); 1]

But to make it normalized, I can factor out b as sqrt(1 + cot^2(theta/2)) ) times the components. Let me compute that.

cot^2(theta/2) + 1 = csc^2(theta/2) → 1/sin^2(theta/2). So sqrt(1 + cot^2(theta/2)) ) = 1/sin(theta/2)

So the normalized eigenvector would be [ cot(theta/2), 1 ] / sqrt(1 + cot^2(theta/2)) )

Which simplifies to [ cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ) ]

Because:

cot(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)

So:

[ (cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)) * sin(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] = [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

And the denominator is 1/sin(theta/2), so when you divide by it, you multiply by sin(theta/2). So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, that's interesting. So the eigenvector is ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )^T, and it's normalized because cos² + sin² = 1.

But wait, wait a second. Let me check if this satisfies equation 2.

Equation 2: sinθ a - (cosθ + 1) b =0

Substituting a = cos(theta/2), b = sin(theta/2):

sinθ * cos(theta/2) - (cosθ + 1) sin(theta/2) = 0?

Let me compute each term.

We know that sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)
Similarly, cosθ = 1 - 2 sin²(theta/2) [using the double-angle formula]

So substituting into equation 2:

[2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] * cos(theta/2) - [ (1 - 2 sin^2(theta/2)) +1 ] * sin(theta/2) 

Simplify each term:

First term: 2 sin(theta/2) cos^2(theta/2)
Second term: [2 - 2 sin^2(theta/2)] * sin(theta/2) = [2(1 - sin^2(theta/2))] * sin(theta/2) = 2 cos^2(theta/2) sin(theta/2)

So equation becomes:

2 sin(theta/2) cos^2(theta/2) - 2 cos^2(theta/2) sin(theta/2) = 0

Which is 0=0. So that's correct. So the eigenvector is indeed [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T, normalized.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C says (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches this. But wait, looking at the options again:

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

But wait, the problem says the operator is P along n, which is in x-z direction, so the eigenvector is in that direction. So in the spin-½ system, the eigenstate with eigenvalue +ħ/2 for the direction n would have the standard form (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2))^T. But in this problem, since the direction is in the x-z plane, phi is zero because n is along the x-z plane, so phi=0. So the second component would be sin(theta/2), not multiplied by e^{i phi}. So the eigenvector simplifies to (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Looking again at the options:

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta))—that doesn't seem right. Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches.

But wait, the eigenvector I found is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), and looking at the options, option C matches.

Wait, but the problem states that the eigenvector should be normalized. Let me check if [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)] is normalized. cos^2(theta/2) + sin^2(theta/2) = 1, so yes, it's already normalized.

So the correct answer should be option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but wait another thing. The problem says the operator is P along n, so the eigenvalue is (+ħ/2). But in my calculation, the eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

Looking at the options, option C is exactly that. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let's make sure. The possible options are:

Option A: (√(2/3)ħ, √(1/3)ħ) → but these are scalars, not in terms of theta; not sure.

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)) → this seems like spherical coordinates without the theta/2 angle.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)) → correct as per my calculation.

Option D: sqrt(2/3)ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3)ħ sin(theta/2) → Not sure about the factors.

Wait, but the answer should have factors of ħ? Or no? Wait, the eigenvector shouldn't have ħ in it. Because ħ is part of the operator, but the eigenvector is a vector of coefficients, which are dimensionless. So in the options, options A and D include ħ; that's probably a mistake because eigenvectors are vectors in Hilbert space, so their components shouldn't have units like ħ. So options A and D are probably incorrect because they include ħ. So only options B and C are left.

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), but for our problem, phi is zero, so it's (cos(theta), sin(theta)). But according to our solution, it's (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is option C.

So the correct answer must be option C.


To solve the problem, we need to find the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$ for an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane. The operator $\vec{P}$ is defined in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices. The direction $\vec{n}$ is given as $(\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$ since it lies in the x-z plane.

### Step 1: Constructing the operator $\vec{P}$
The operator $\vec{P}$ in the direction $\vec{n}$ is expressed as:
\[
\vec{P} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z
\]
Substituting $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$, and using the given matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$, the matrix representation of $\vec{P}$ becomes:
\[
\vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} 
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos\theta & \sin\theta \\
\sin\theta & -\cos\theta
\end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 2: Eigenvalue equation
The eigenvalue equation is:
\[
\vec{P} | \psi \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} | \psi \rangle
\]
Dividing through by $\frac{\hbar}{2}$, we get:
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos\theta & \sin\theta \\
\sin\theta & -\cos\theta
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
a \\
b
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
a \\
b
\end{bmatrix}
\]
This leads to the system of equations:
\[
\cos\theta a + \sin\theta b = a, \quad \sin\theta a - \cos\theta b = b
\]

### Step 3: Solving for $a$ and $b$
From the first equation:
\[
(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0 \implies a = \frac{\sin\theta}{1 - \cos\theta} b
\]
Using trigonometric identities, $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$ and $1 - \cos\theta = 2\sin^2(\theta/2)$, we simplify:
\[
a = \frac{\cos(\theta/2)}{\sin(\theta/2)} b = \cot(\theta/2) b
\]
Thus, the eigenvector can be written as:
\[
| \psi \rangle = b \begin{bmatrix}
\cot(\theta/2) \\
1
\end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 4: Normalization
To normalize the eigenvector, we compute the normalization factor:
\[
\sqrt{\cot^2(\theta/2) + 1} = \sqrt{\csc^2(\theta/2)} = \frac{1}{\sin(\theta/2)}
\]
The normalized eigenvector is:
\[
| \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix}
\cos(\theta/2) \\
\sin(\theta/2)
\end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 5: Analyzing the options
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$ includes $\hbar$, which is incorrect for eigenvector components.
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$ does not match the derived eigenvector, as it uses $\theta$ instead of $\theta/2$.
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$ matches the derived normalized eigenvector.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$ includes incorrect normalization factors and $\hbar$.

The correct answer is **Option C**, as it matches the normalized eigenvector derived from the eigenvalue equation.

Answer: C
