Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The question is about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroid-shaped, with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a certain wavelength lambda. In the radiation zone, the power radiated per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and the angle theta from the z-axis. The maximum power is A, and I need to find what fraction of A is radiated at theta = 30 degrees, as well as the possible form of f.

The options are A to D, each giving a fraction and a power dependence on lambda.

Hmm, I remember that when charges oscillate, they emit electromagnetic radiation. The radiation pattern depends on the symmetry of the charge distribution. Since it's spheroid-shaped and symmetric along the z-axis, I think this implies some sort of dipole radiation or maybe quadrupole, but dipoles are simpler.

Wait, wait. For a dipole antenna, the radiation pattern in the far field (radiation zone) is a function of theta. The radiated power per unit solid angle for an oscillating dipole is given by the radiation pattern of a dipole. I think the formula for the power per unit solid angle is proportional to (sin theta)^2. No, wait, isn't the dipole radiation pattern maximum at theta = 90 degrees, and the intensity (which relates to power) is proportional to sin^2 theta? Or wait, maybe the power is proportional to sin^2 theta.

Wait, no. Let me think again. For a dipole, the electric field in the far zone is proportional to (1/r) and depends on theta. The electric field components are Eθ and Ez, but the maximum intensity is at theta = 90 degrees, which is the equatorial plane.

The radiated power per unit solid angle, which is the intensity, is given by P = (something) * (sin theta)^2. Because the maximum occurs when theta is 90 degrees, that makes sense.

So the function f(theta) would be proportional to sin^2 theta. So the maximum occurs at theta=90, and it's zero at theta=0 and 180 degrees.

Wait, but the question says the maximum power is A. So the fraction at a specific theta would be [f(theta)/f_max].

Wait, no. Wait, the function f is the power per unit solid angle. So the total power is the integral of f over all solid angles. So the maximum value of f would be when sin^2 theta is maximum, which is when theta is 90 degrees, giving sin^2 90 = 1. So at theta=90, f is maximum.

But for the problem, we are to find the fraction of A (the maximum) that is radiated at theta=30 degrees.

Wait, wait. Wait, let me clarify. A is the maximum power radiated. So A is the maximum value of f. So, f(theta) is the power per unit solid angle at angle theta. So the total power is the integral over all solid angles of f(theta) dOmega. But the maximum value of f is A. So, to find the fraction of A radiated at theta=30, I think we have to compute f(theta=30) / A.

But wait, wait, the question says, "the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle theta = 30^0". Wait, that's ambiguous. Is it the fraction of the total power which is A, that is radiated at theta=30? Or is it the fraction of the maximum A, such as f(theta=30) is some fraction of A?

Wait, the way it's phrased: "the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle theta = 30^0". So A is the maximum power. So, the power at theta=30 is some fraction of the maximum power A. So, the fraction is f(theta=30)/A.

Because the maximum value of f is A, so the fraction is f(theta)/A, which is sin^2(theta)/(sin^2(90)) since sin^2(theta) is the function. Wait, no, because f is proportional to sin^2(theta), but perhaps with some other factors.

Wait, let's think more carefully. The radiated power per unit solid angle (intensity) for a dipole is given by:

I = ( (μ0 * p^2 ω^4 ) / (12π c^3) ) * sin^2(theta)

Where p is the dipole moment, ω is the angular frequency, c is speed of light, μ0 is permeability.

The maximum intensity occurs at theta = 90 degrees, so I_max = I(90) = (μ0 p^2 ω^4)/(12 π c^3) * 1.

So, the intensity at any angle theta is I(theta) = I_max * sin^2(theta).

Hence, the fraction of the maximum intensity at theta is I(theta)/I_max = sin^2(theta).

So for theta = 30 degrees, sin(theta) is 0.5. So sin^2(theta) is 0.25. So the fraction is 0.25, which is 1/4.

Wait, but I thought the question refers to the fraction of the maximum power A, which is the maximum intensity. So the fraction would be 1/4.

Wait, but the question says, "the fraction of A that will be radiated at theta = 30^0". So if A is the maximum, then the fraction is 1/4.

Now, looking at the options, the options that have 1/4 as the first part are B and C.

Option B: 1/4, lambda^-3.

Option C: 1/4, lambda^-4.

So which one is correct?

Wait, the function f is the power per unit solid angle, which is the intensity. The intensity for dipole radiation is proportional to 1/lambda^4, because lambda and frequency are related. Let's think about the dependence on lambda.

Wait, the intensity I is proportional to (ω^4) * sin^2(theta) * something. But ω is 2π times the frequency f, and frequency f is related to wavelength lambda by f = c / lambda. So ω = 2π c / lambda. So ω^4 = (2π c)^4 / lambda^4.

So the intensity I is proportional to (1/lambda^4) * sin^2(theta).

So the function f(theta, lambda) is proportional to 1/lambda^4 times sin^2(theta).

Therefore, the form of f is K * (sin^2(theta)) / lambda^4, where K is a constant.

So the function f is inversely proportional to lambda^4.

Looking at the options, option C says 1/4 and lambda^-4. So that fits.

So the fraction is 1/4, and the form is lambda^-4.

Wait, but let me check the question again. The question says, "the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,".

So the two parts are the fraction and the form.

So the fraction is 1/4, and the form is lambda^(-4), so option C.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option C: 1/4 and λ^(-4).

The problem involves an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid-shaped and symmetric along the z-axis. This system radiates power, and the radiated power per unit solid angle is a function \( f(\lambda, \theta) \), where \( \lambda \) is the wavelength and \( \theta \) is the angle with respect to the z-axis. The maximum radiated power is denoted as \( A \), and the task is to determine the fraction of \( A \) radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) and the possible form of \( f \).

For a dipole-like oscillating charge distribution, the radiated power per unit solid angle (intensity) is proportional to \( \sin^2\theta \). The maximum intensity occurs at \( \theta = 90^\circ \), where \( \sin^2\theta = 1 \). At \( \theta = 30^\circ \), \( \sin^2\theta = (0.5)^2 = 0.25 \). Thus, the fraction of the maximum power \( A \) radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \( 0.25 \), or \( 1/4 \).

The intensity \( f \) also depends on \( \lambda \). For dipole radiation, the intensity is proportional to \( \omega^4 \), where \( \omega \) is the angular frequency. Since \( \omega = 2\pi f \) and \( f = c / \lambda \), it follows that \( \omega^4 \propto 1 / \lambda^4 \). Therefore, the intensity \( f \) is inversely proportional to \( \lambda^4 \), i.e., \( f \propto \lambda^{-4} \).

Among the given options, the one that matches both the fraction \( 1/4 \) and the dependence \( \lambda^{-4} \) is **Option C**.
