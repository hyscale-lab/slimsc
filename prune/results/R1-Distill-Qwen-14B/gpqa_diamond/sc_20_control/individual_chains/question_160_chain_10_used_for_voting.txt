Okay, so I've got this physics problem about diffraction, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem says there's an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon, and all the apothems are the same length 'a'. A monochromatic light (wavelength λ) is shining along the z-axis, and in the far field, there are intensity maxima and minima. The question is asking for the angular distance between the first two minima when N approaches infinity. Oh, and we can use the small angle approximation where tanθ ≈ θ.

Hmm, so first, when N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle. Right, because as the number of sides increases, a regular polygon approaches a circle. So the aperture is effectively a circular one. That makes sense because when N is infinite, the shape is a circle, and its apothem 'a' would correspond to the radius. Wait, wait, wait. Apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a circle, the apothem is the same as the radius. So the radius R of the circular aperture is 'a'.

Now, the setup is a monochromatic light shining vertically onto this aperture. So it's a Fraunhofer diffraction scenario because the observation is in the far field. For a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern has a central bright spot (the Airy disk) surrounded by concentric dark rings, but the minima occur at specific angles. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact positions of the minima.

Wait, for a circular aperture, the first minimum in the diffraction pattern occurs at an angle θ where sinθ ≈ 1.22 λ/(π a). Because the formula for the minima in circular diffraction is a sinθ = m λ, where m is an integer, but wait, no, the minima are given by a sinθ = m λ where m is 1, 2, 3... but wait, no. Wait, no, for a circular aperture, the first minimum is at a sinθ = 1.22 λ, not m=1. Because the Bessel function zeros come into play here. Oh right, the minima occur when the argument of the Bessel function J1 is at its zeros. The first zero of J1 is at approximately 3.8317, but when we write the condition for the minima, it's a sinθ = λ (x)/(π), where x is the zero. So for the first minimum, x=3.8317, so sinθ ≈ (3.8317) λ/(π a). Wait, let me think again. Oh wait, the formula for the minima in circular diffraction is given by a sinθ = (x_mn) λ / π, where x_mn is the nth zero of the mth Bessel function. For the first minimum after the central maximum, m=1, n=1, so x_11 is approximately 3.8317. So sinθ ≈ (3.8317 λ)/(π a) ≈ (1.2205) λ/a. Wait, because 3.8317 divided by π is approximately 1.2205. So the first minimum is at θ1 where sinθ1 ≈ 1.2205 λ/a. But since the problem tells us to use the small angle approximation (tanθ ≈ θ), and since θ is small, we can approximate sinθ ≈ θ. So θ1 ≈ 1.2205 λ/a.

Wait, but the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the first minimum occurs at the first dark ring, the second at the next one. Wait, no, for circular apertures, the minima are at θ where a sinθ = (x_mn) λ/π, where x_mn is the nth zero of the mth Bessel function. The first minimum (after the central maximum) is the first dark ring, and the next minimum is the second dark ring. Wait, but in the problem, when we have a polygon with infinitely many sides (so a circle), the first minimum is at θ1, the second at θ2, and the angular separation is θ2 - θ1. But wait, the options don't seem to match that. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing something. Let me get this straight. The problem says, when N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle. So the minima are determined by the circular aperture's diffraction pattern. So for a circular aperture, the angles of the minima are given by the zeros of the Bessel function. The first minimum is at a sinθ = 1.22 λ (since 3.8317/π ≈ 1.2205). The next minimum is at a sinθ = 2.405 λ (since x_01 is 2.405 for the 0th Bessel function?), wait no, wait. Wait, no. For the circular case, each minimum comes from a specific Bessel function zero. The first minimum is the first zero of J1, which is x_11=3.8317. The next minima would come from x_12=7.0156, but wait, no, because each ring is from a different Bessel function. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting that wrong.

Wait, maybe I should recall the exact expressions. The minima in the diffraction pattern occur when J_m(k a sinθ) = 0, where k=2π/λ, and m is the order of the Bessel function. The first minima occur when m=1 and the first zero of J1 is at x=3.8317. So the condition is a sinθ = (x_m) λ/(k), but k is 2π/λ, so (x_m λ)/(k) = (x_m λ (λ))/(2 π a)) )? Wait, perhaps another approach.

Wait, another approach. The condition for minima in circular diffraction is a sinθ = (x_mn) λ/(π), where x_mn is the nth zero of the mth Bessel function. So for the first minimum (m=1, n=1), it's x_11=3.8317, so sinθ ≈ 3.8317 λ/(π a) ≈ 1.2205 λ/a. So θ1 ≈ 1.2205 λ/a (using small angle approximation, sinθ ≈ θ).

Wait, but the next minima. Hmm, wait, each dark ring corresponds to higher orders. So the next minimum after the first would be the next zero of J1, which is x_12=7.0156. So the next angle θ2 would be sinθ2 = 7.0156 λ/(π a) ≈ (7.0156/ π) λ/a ≈ 2.235 λ/a. But wait, that would give a much larger angle. So the angular separation between the first two minima would be θ2 - θ1 ≈ (2.235 - 1.2205) λ/a ≈ 1.0145 λ/a. But that's not an option in the given choices. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the first two minima refer to the first and second orders, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem states that the polygon becomes a circle when N approaches infinity. So the diffraction pattern is that of a circular aperture. The first minimum is at θ1 ≈ 1.22 λ/a, and the second minimum is at θ2. But wait, for a circular aperture, the first minimum is the first dark ring, and the next minima are located at higher angles, but perhaps the second minima is not the next ring but perhaps another occurrence. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the first two minima as the first and second zeros of J1, but that would lead to an angular distance of around 1.0145 λ/a, which isn't an option.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is 1.220 λ/a, which is the same as the first minimum. Option D is 0.506 λ/a, which is about half of 1.014. Hmm, but perhaps the problem is not about the circular aperture's minima but about the polygon's minima when N is infinite.

Wait, wait. Another approach: when N is infinitely large, the aperture becomes a circle, but perhaps the question is considering the diffraction pattern as if it's a polygon with infinite sides, but perhaps the approach is different. Alternatively, maybe the question is treating it as a single slit, but no, a polygon would have multiple sides, but N approaching infinity makes it a circle. So perhaps the first minimum is at θ ≈ λ/(a), but that's for a single slit. Wait, wait, for a single slit of width 'a', the minima are at a sinθ = m λ, where m is integer, so first minimum at θ = λ/(a). But in a circle, it's 1.22 λ/a.

But the options have option C as 1.220 λ/a, which is the first minimum. But the question is asking about the angular distance between the first two minima. Oh wait, perhaps the question is not about the circle's minima but the polygon's diffraction when N is large. Wait, no. The options don't have 1.014 λ/a, which I thought earlier.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the wrong formula. Let me think again. For a circular aperture, the first minimum is at θ ≈ 1.22 λ/a. The next minima are at higher angles, but perhaps the next minimum is at 2.23 λ/a or something. But the angular separation between the first and second minima would be 2.23 - 1.22 = 1.01 λ/a. But none of the options match this.

Wait, maybe the problem is not about the circle but about a polygon, but N is very large. So perhaps the approach is different. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is treating the aperture as a rectangular or something else, but no, the polygon becomes a circle.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the first two minima as the first and the second zeros of the Bessel function, but perhaps the angular separation is the difference between the first and second zeros, which would be about 2.235 - 1.2205, which is approximately 1.0145, but that's not an option.

Wait, looking at the options again:

A) 0.610 λ/a

B) 0.500 λ/a

C) 1.220 λ/a

D) 0.506 λ/a

Hmm, option D is 0.506, which is about 1.2205 / 2. So maybe the angular distance between two consecutive minima is half the first minimum angle? That doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the angular separation between two adjacent minima as the difference between their angles.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think about the setup again. The problem says that when the light falls on the aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima. The first two minima would be the first and second minima after the central maximum. So for a circular aperture, the first minimum is at θ1 = 1.22 λ/a, and the second minimum is at θ2 = 2.235 λ/a (assuming the second zero is at x=2.405, which is the first zero of J0, but that's the central maximum. Wait, no, J0's first zero is at 2.405, but that's the first minimum after the central maximum in the diffraction pattern. Wait, no, the central maximum is from J0, and its first zero is at 2.405, which is the first minimum after the central maximum. Wait, but that's not correct because the central maximum is from the zeroth order Bessel function, and the first minimum is when J0 reaches zero, which is at 2.405, but wait, for a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern's central maximum is from the zeroth-order term, and the first minimum occurs when J0(k a sinθ) = 0, which is when k a sinθ = 2.405 λ/(a) ... Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting this mixed up.

Wait, the Bessel functions for m=0,1,2,... are involved. The central maximum is due to m=0. The minima occur when for m=0, J0(k a sinθ) = 0, which happens when k a sinθ = x_mn λ, where x_01=2.405. So the first minimum after the central maximum would be at θ where a sinθ = x_01 λ/(k a) ? Wait, no, perhaps let me clarify.

The general condition for a minimum is J_m(k a sinθ) = 0. So for m=0, the first minimum is at k a sinθ = x_01 λ, where x_01=2.405. So θ01 = (x_01 λ)/(k a) = (2.405 λ)/( (2π/λ) a )) ) = (2.405 λ^2 )/(2 π a ). Wait, no, perhaps I'm missing a step.

Wait, k is 2π/λ, so for m=0, the condition is a sinθ = x_mn λ/(k), where x_mn is the nth zero of J_m.

So, a sinθ = (x_mn λ)/(k) = (x_mn λ) / (2π/λ) ) = (x_mn λ^2 )/(2 π a ). Wait, no, perhaps I should re-arrange.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write it as a sinθ = (x_mn λ)/(2 π), because k = 2π/λ, so a sinθ = (x_mn λ)/(k) = (x_mn λ) * (λ)/(2 π) )? Wait, this is getting confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the formula: a sinθ = (x_mn λ)/(π) because the formula is a sinθ = (x_mn λ)/(π), where x_mn is the nth zero of J_m. So for the first minimum of m=0, x_01 is 2.405, so a sinθ = (2.405 λ)/(π) ≈ 0.765 λ/a. Wait, no, because a is the radius, so sinθ = (2.405 λ)/(π a).

Wait, but I'm getting stuck, perhaps I should look for a standard result. Oh wait, I remember that the first minimum for a circular aperture is at θ≈1.22 λ/a, which comes from J1 (the first-order Bessel function). So the first minimum after the central maximum is at θ1=1.22 λ/a, and the next minimum (which is the first minimum of J0) is at θ2= (2.405 λ)/(π a) ) ≈ 0.765 λ/a. Wait, that can't be, because 2.405/π is approximately 0.765, which is less than 1.22.

Wait, this suggests that the first minimum (from J1) is at a higher angle than the second minimum (from J0). But that doesn't make sense because the central maximum is the brightest, and the first minima should be the ones further out. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Maybe the first minima after the central maximum is from J0, which occurs at 2.405 λ/(π a), and the next minima is from J1, which is at 3.8317 λ/(π a). Wait, that makes sense because 3.8317/π is about 1.2205, so 1.2205 λ/a. So the first minima (from J0) is at θ2 = 0.765 λ/a, and the next minima (from J1) is at θ1=1.2205 λ/a. But that would imply that the first minima occurs at a larger angle than the second, which doesn't make sense because the central maximum is in the middle and the minima should be on either side.

Wait, perhaps I'm confused about the order of the Bessel functions. Let's think: the central maximum is caused by the m=0 term (J0), and the first minimum occurs when J0(k a sinθ) reaches zero for the first time, which is at x_01=2.405. So the condition is:

a sinθ = x_01 λ/(π) = (2.405 λ)/π ≈ 0.765 λ/a.

Wait, but that's the angle for the first minimum after the central maximum. Then the next minimum would be at the first zero of J1, which is x_11=3.8317, so a sinθ = (3.8317 λ)/π ≈ 1.2205 λ/a. So the first two minima are at θ1=0.765 λ/a and θ2=1.2205 λ/a.

Wait, but that can't be right because 0.765 is smaller than 1.2205. So the angular distance between them would be 1.2205 - 0.765 = 0.4555 λ/a, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, but the problem asks for the angular distance between the first two minima. So perhaps the first minima is at 1.2205, the second at 2.405/π, which is 0.765, but that would mean the first minimum is at a larger angle than the second, which is impossible because the central maximum is in the center. So perhaps I'm getting this all wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the first minima is at 1.2205, and the next minima is at 2.405/π * λ/a, which is larger than 1.2205. Let me compute 2.405/3.1416 ≈ 0.765, which is less than 1.2205. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I should accept that I'm confused and think about the options given. The options include 1.220 λ/a (option C), which is the first minimum. But the question is about the distance between the first two minima, not just the position of the first.

Wait, perhaps the first two minima are the first and second minima from the same Bessel function, say J1. So the first minima is at x_11=3.8317, the second at x_12=7.0156. So the angles would be θ1=3.8317 λ/(π a), θ2=7.0156 λ/(π a). The angular separation would be (7.0156-3.8317) λ/(π a) = 3.1839 λ/(π a) ≈ 1.013 λ/a. But that's not an option.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a single slit with width 'a', but that would make the first minimum at sinθ=λ/a, which is option B (0.500 lambda/a if a is the width, but wait, the options have 'a' in the denominator). Wait, no, option B is 0.500 λ/a, which would correspond to sinθ=0.5 λ/a. So if the first minimum is at θ=0.5 λ/a, but that's for a single slit of width a. But in this case, the aperture is a circle, so that's not applicable.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again about the problem statement. It says that all apothems are of the same length 'a'. For a regular polygon with N sides, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So as N approaches infinity, the apothem 'a' becomes the radius of the circle. So the radius R = a.

For a circular aperture, the minima occur at θ where a sinθ = x_mn λ/(π), where x_mn is the nth zero of J_m. The first minimum (after the central maximum) is at m=1, n=1, x_11=3.8317, so θ1= (3.8317 λ)/(π a) ≈ 1.2205 λ/a.

The next minima would be the next zero of J1, which is x_12=7.0156. So θ2=(7.0156 λ)/(π a) ≈ (2.235 λ)/a. The angular distance between these two minima would be θ2 - θ1 = (2.235 - 1.2205) λ/a ≈ 1.0145 λ/a. But this doesn't match any of the options.

Hmm, but looking at the options, option D is 0.506 λ/a, which is approximately (1.2205/2). So perhaps the question is asking about the angular separation between two consecutive maxima? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in considering the minima. Another thought: perhaps the first two minima are the first and second minima of the same Bessel function, but that's not the case. The minima from J1 are at x=3.8317, 7.0156, etc. The minima from J0 are at x=2.405, 5.520, etc. So the first minima after the central maximum (from J0) is at θ01=2.405 λ/(π a) ≈ 0.765 λ/a. The next minima is from J0 at θ02=5.520 λ/(π a) ≈ 1.758 λ/a. Then the angular separation is 1.758 - 0.765 ≈ 0.993 λ/a. Still not matching any options.

Wait, but looking back, the problem says "the first two minima". So perhaps the first minima is the one from J1 (θ1=1.2205), and the second minima is from J0 (θ2=0.765). But that would give a negative separation, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting the order wrong.

Wait, perhaps the order of the Bessel functions is such that the first minima is from J0, then the next from J1, but that doesn't seem right because the J0 minima are closer in angle.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the problem differently. Maybe the question is treating the polygon as a single slit, but that doesn't make sense when N is approaching infinity. Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the minima of the diffraction pattern but something else.

Wait, another approach: when the aperture is a circle, the diffraction pattern's first minimum is at θ=1.22 λ/a. The question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. So perhaps the first minima is at θ=1.22 λ/a, and the second minima is at the next Bessel function zero, which is 2.405 λ/(π a) ≈ 0.765 λ/a. But that would mean the second minima is at a smaller angle, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe the problem is asking about the angular distance between the first and second minima as the same as the first minimum itself. But that doesn't match the question.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the minima as the points where the intensity drops to zero, and the first two minima are the ones immediately surrounding the central maximum. But in a circular aperture, the first minimum occurs at θ1≈1.2205 λ/a, and the next minimum is actually at a higher angle, perhaps θ2≈2.235 λ/a. So the angular separation would be θ2 - θ1 ≈ 0.999 λ/a, approximately 1.0 λ/a. But none of the options match this.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach. Let me think about the far-field diffraction for a circular aperture. The intensity is given by the square of the Bessel function. The first minimum occurs at θ1 where J1(k a sinθ) = 0, which is at x=3.8317, so a sinθ1 = (3.8317 λ)/(π) → θ1 = (3.8317 λ)/(π a) ≈ 1.2205 λ/a.

The next minima would be the next zeros of J1, which is at x=7.0156. So a sinθ2 = (7.0156 λ)/(π) → θ2 = (7.0156 λ)/(π a) ≈ 2.235 λ/a. But wait, 7.0156 is the second zero of J1, so that's the second minima for J1. The angular separation between these two minima would be θ2 - θ1 = (7.0156 -3.8317) λ/(π a) ≈ 3.1839 λ/(π a) ≈ 1.013 λ/a, which is approximately 1.013, but none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the circular case, but about a polygon with very large N. Hmm, but when N is very large, the polygon approaches a circle, so the diffraction pattern should be similar to a circle.

Wait, looking at the options again, option D is 0.506 λ/a, which is approximately half of 1.013. So perhaps I'm double-counting something, but I'm not sure.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the minima as the points where the intensity first drops to zero, not considering the order. But in that case, the first minimum is at 1.2205, and the next is at 2.405/π * λ/a ≈ 0.765, which isn't possible because 0.765 is smaller than 1.2205.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the first two minima as the first and second minima of the same Bessel function, but that would be for J1, giving a separation of about 1.013.

But none of the options match that. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct answer is option C, 1.220 λ/a, which is the position of the first minimum. But the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima, not the position.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. Let me think again. The options suggest that the correct answer is either option C or D. Since option C is the first minimum, perhaps the angular distance between the first two minima is not applicable because the first minima is at 1.220, and the second is at higher angles, but the separation isn't in the options. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the single-slit diffraction, but that doesn't fit the polygon scenario.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the polygon isn't a circle but a regular N-gon, and when N is very large, it's treated as a circle, but the diffraction pattern's minima are calculated differently. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for a rectangular aperture, but that doesn't make sense either.

Wait, maybe the problem is actually about a single slit, and the first two minima are at m=1 and m=2, so the separation is (2λ/a - λ/a) = λ/a. But none of the options have λ/a as an option, but option B is 0.500 λ/a, which is λ/(2a), so that would be the separation if the minima are at m=1 and m=2, but wait, the first minimum is at m=1 and the next at m=2, which would give a separation of λ/a. But again, that's not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about a double slit, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the angular separation between the first and second minima as the same as the first minimum. But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should just go with the first minimum and assume that the answer is option C, 1.220 λ/a. But the question is about the distance between the first two minima, which would be the difference between the first and second minima. But since the options don't have that, perhaps the intended answer is option C, as it's the first minimum.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not about the circular case, but about a polygon with N approaching infinity. So perhaps the apertures are arranged in a way that for large N, the diffraction pattern can be approximated differently.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let's think differently. The problem says that all apothems are of the same length 'a'. For a regular N-gon, the apothem is the distance from the center to the side. As N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle with radius R = a / cos(π/N). Wait, wait, for a regular polygon, apothem a = R cos(π/N), where R is the radius (distance from center to a vertex). So as N → ∞, π/N → 0, cos(π/N) ≈ 1 - (π/N)^2 / 2. So R ≈ a (1 + (π^2)/(2 N^2)) ). So as N → ∞, R approaches a. So the radius of the circle is a.

Thus, for the circular case, the first minimum is at θ1=1.2205 λ/a, and the second minimum is at θ2=2.405 λ/(π a) ≈ 0.765 λ/a. Wait, that can't be right because 0.765 is less than 1.2205. So the angular separation would be θ1 - θ2 ≈ 0.4555 λ/a, which is approximately 0.456 λ/a. But that's not an option either.

Hmm. Perhaps the problem is considering the angular distance as the same as the first minimum, but that doesn't fit with the question.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the angular distance between the first minimum and the next maximum, but that doesn't make sense because the maxima and minima are adjacent.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the first two minima as the first and second minima of the same Bessel function. For J1, the first two zeros are x=3.8317 and x=7.0156. The separation is 7.0156-3.8317 ≈ 3.1839. So the angular separation would be (3.1839 λ)/(π a) ≈ 1.013 λ/a. But again, not matching any options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the far-field pattern again. For a circular aperture, the minima are given by a sinθ = (x_mn λ)/(π), where x_mn is the nth zero of J_m. The first minima after the central maximum is from m=0, n=1, which is at x=2.405, so a sinθ = (2.405 λ)/(π) → θ ≈ (2.405)/(3.1416) * (λ/a) ≈ 0.765 λ/a. The next minima would be from m=1, n=1, at x=3.8317: a sinθ = (3.8317 λ)/(π) → θ ≈ (3.8317/3.1416) * (λ/a) ≈ 1.2205 λ/a. Then, the angular separation between these two minima would be 1.2205 - 0.765 ≈ 0.4555 λ/a, which is approximately 0.456 λ/a. But none of the options match this.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 0.506 λ/a, which is close to 0.456. Alternatively, perhaps I made a calculation mistake. Let me compute 3.8317 - 2.405 = 1.4267. Divided by π: 1.4267 / 3.1416 ≈ 0.454, so 0.454 λ/a. So perhaps the correct answer is approximately 0.454 λ/a, but that's not one of the options. The closest option is D) 0.506 λ/a, which is about 0.506, which is roughly 0.454 * 1.11, but not exact.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the minima. Let me check the zeros of the Bessel functions again. The first zero of J0 is at x=2.405, the first zero of J1 is at x=3.8317. So for a circular aperture, the first minima (after the central maximum) is from J0 at x=2.405, then from J1 at x=3.8317, then from J0 again at x=5.520 (the second zero of J0), then J1 at x=7.0156, etc.

So the first two minima would be at θ1= (2.405 λ)/(π a) ≈ 0.765 λ/a, and θ2= (3.8317 λ)/(π a) ≈ 1.2205 λ/a. The angular separation between them is 1.2205 - 0.765 = 0.4555 λ/a. But none of the options have this value.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the angular distance from the central maximum to the first minima, which would be 1.2205 λ/a, corresponding to option C. But the question is about the distance between the first two minima.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Based on the options and the reasoning, the only possible match is option C, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is option D, 0.506 λ/a, which is approximately θ2 - θ1 if I'm making a calculation error.

Wait, another angle. Perhaps the first two minima are at θ1 = 1.2205 λ/a and θ2 = 2.405 λ/a. Wait, no, that would be a larger angle but that's not correct because 2.405/π is about 0.765, which is smaller than 1.2205.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the minima as the points where the intensity falls to zero, and the first two minima are the first and second zeros of the same Bessel function. But that would be J1 at x=3.8317 and x=7.0156, leading to a separation of (7.0156 -3.8317) = 3.1839, so 3.1839 λ/(π a) ≈ 1.013 λ/a. But again, not matching any options.

Given that, perhaps the intended answer is option C, 1.220 λ/a, which is the position of the first minima. But the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima, which I'm not seeing in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the first two minima as the first and second zeros of the same Bessel function (J1), leading to a separation of 1.013 λ/a, but since that's not an option, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option C, 1.220 λ/a, as it's the position of the first minimum, and perhaps the question is a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, I might have made a mistake in understanding the problem.

Wait, but the problem specifically asks for the angular distance between the first two minima. So perhaps I should take the first minima as from J0 and the second from J1, giving a separation of 0.4555 λ/a, but none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D, 0.506 λ/a, which is approximately half of 1.013. Or perhaps it's the first minima from J1 (1.2205) minus the first minima from J0 (0.765), giving 0.4555, but that's not close to any option except D, which is 0.506, about 0.05 off.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D) 0.506 λ/a. Because when you compute (3.8317 -2.405)=1.4267, and divide by π, 1.4267/3.1416 ≈ 0.454, which is close to 0.506 but not exact. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation involves using the small angle approximation, which I might have missed.

Wait, perhaps the problem states that the related angles are small, so tanθ ≈ θ. But in the earlier steps, I used sinθ ≈ θ. So perhaps the calculation should involve using sinθ ≈ tanθ = θ, but that shouldn't make a significant difference since for small angles, sinθ ≈ θ ≈ tanθ.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the separation with more precise values.

x_01=2.4048 (J0 first zero)
x_11=3.8317 (J1 first zero)

So the separation is x_11 - x_01 = 3.8317 - 2.4048 = 1.4269.

So the angular separation is (1.4269 λ)/(π a) ≈ 1.4269 / 3.1416 ≈ 0.4542 λ/a.

But option D is 0.506 λ/a, which is about 0.506. Hmm, not matching. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the angular positions of the first two minima, which are the first minima from J0 and J1, and then find the difference.

But 0.4542 λ/a is approximately 0.454, which is not one of the options. So perhaps the intended answer is option C, 1.220 λ/a, as it's the position of the first minima, but the question is about the distance between the first two minima, which would be this. But perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the first two minima as the first and second minima of the same Bessel function, but I don't think that's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is treating the polygon as a single slit, but that's not the case when N is large. Alternatively, the problem might be considering the polygon as a rectangular aperture, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, as it's the position of the first minima, and the question is mistakenly asking about the position and not the separation, but that's just a guess.

But given the options and the calculations, I'm inclined to think that the correct answer is option C, 1.220 λ/a, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is option D, 0.506 λ/a, which is half of 1.013, but I'm not sure why that would be the case.

The problem involves a monochromatic light of wavelength $\lambda$ shining vertically on an aperture shaped as an $N$-sided polygon, where all apothems are of the same length $a$. When $N$ approaches infinity, the aperture becomes a circle with radius $a$. The task is to determine the angular distance between the first two minima in the far-field diffraction pattern, assuming small angles where $\tan\theta \approx \theta$.

For a circular aperture, the minima in the diffraction pattern occur at angles where $a \sin\theta = \frac{x_{mn} \lambda}{\pi}$, where $x_{mn}$ is the $n$-th zero of the $m$-th Bessel function. The first minimum after the central maximum corresponds to the first zero of $J_0$, which occurs at $x_{01} = 2.405$. The second minimum corresponds to the first zero of $J_1$, which occurs at $x_{11} = 3.8317$. Using these values:

1. The angular position of the first minimum (from $J_0$) is:
   \[
   \theta_1 = \frac{x_{01} \lambda}{\pi a} = \frac{2.405 \lambda}{\pi a} \approx 0.765 \frac{\lambda}{a}.
   \]

2. The angular position of the second minimum (from $J_1$) is:
   \[
   \theta_2 = \frac{x_{11} \lambda}{\pi a} = \frac{3.8317 \lambda}{\pi a} \approx 1.2205 \frac{\lambda}{a}.
   \]

The angular distance between the first two minima is:
\[
\Delta\theta = \theta_2 - \theta_1 = \frac{x_{11} - x_{01}}{\pi a} \lambda = \frac{3.8317 - 2.405}{\pi a} \lambda \approx \frac{1.4267}{\pi} \frac{\lambda}{a} \approx 0.4555 \frac{\lambda}{a}.
\]

However, none of the provided options match this calculated value exactly. The closest option is **D) $0.506 \lambda / a$**, which is slightly higher than the computed value. Given the options and the reasoning, the most reasonable choice is:
