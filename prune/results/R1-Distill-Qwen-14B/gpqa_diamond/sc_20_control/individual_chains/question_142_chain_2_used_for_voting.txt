Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position in the qubits space. The options are given as points in some space. I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. 

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, that looks familiar. Oh right, this is the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. So, the density matrix is a statistical mixture of the |0> and |1> states, each with equal probability. 

I think the question is asking where this state is located in the Bloch sphere representation. Oh right, the Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. For pure states, they're represented as points on the surface of the sphere, while mixed states are inside. 

The Bloch vector for a qubit is usually written as r = (x, y, z), where each component corresponds to the expectation value of the Pauli matrices. So, the density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector as ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices. 

Let me compute that for the given ρ. The given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let's write that out in matrix form. 

|0><0| is the matrix [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. Dividing by 2, we get ρ = (1/2) I. 

So, ρ is (I)/2. Let's compare this to the Bloch form. The identity matrix I is (I + r·σ)/2 multiplied by 2. Wait, no. Let me write the general form again. For a general density matrix, ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z ) / 2. So, if I have (I)/2, then r_x, r_y, r_z must all be zero. Because I = (I + 0 + 0 + 0)/2. 

So the Bloch vector r would be (0,0,0). Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). That makes sense because the maximally mixed state is at the center of the Bloch sphere, not on the surface. 

Wait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Because sometimes I confuse the Bloch vector with the density matrix. Yeah, when all the diagonal elements are 1/2 and the off-diagonal are zero, that's the maximally mixed state. Which in Bloch sphere terms is the center. So the correct option is C.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This is the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation, qubit states are visualized as points. For pure states, they lie on the surface of the sphere, while mixed states are inside. The Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} = (x, y, z) \) corresponds to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices, and the density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli matrices. For the given \( \rho \), it is equivalent to \( \frac{1}{2} I \), which implies that all components of the Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} \) (i.e., \( r_x, r_y, r_z \)) are zero. This means the state is at the center of the Bloch sphere, corresponding to the maximally mixed state.

Among the options provided, the correct geometrical position is \( r = (0, 0, 0) \), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
