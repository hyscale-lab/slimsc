Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a given spin state. The state is provided as (3i, 4), which I think is a two-component vector. 

Hmm, right. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the spin state is a vector in a two-dimensional Hilbert space. The spin operators are represented by Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So for S_x, S_y, and S_z, the operators are (ħ/2) times the respective Pauli matrices σ_x, σ_y, σ_z.

The problem gives the state as (3i, 4). So, the state vector is χ = [3i, 4]^T. To find the expectation value of S_y, I need to compute ⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨χ| S_y |χ⟩.

Wait, expectation value formula is right. So let's write down S_y first. The σ_y matrix is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by that. So S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

The expectation value is then χ† (conjugate transpose) multiplied by S_y multiplied by χ. So let me write that out.

First, let's write out the state χ. χ is [3i, 4]^T. So χ† would be the row vector [ -3 (since (3i)* is -3i?), wait no: wait, (3i)* is -3i, but when taking the conjugate transpose, it's the complex conjugate. So if χ = [a; b], then χ† is [a*, b*], right?

So χ† is [ -3i, 4 ] because (3i)* is -3i, and 4 is real, so 4* is 4.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the state is (3i, 4), so in component form, it's [3i; 4]. So the conjugate would be [-3i; 4*] which is [-3i;4], since 4 is real. So χ† is [-3i, 4].

Wait no, wait. Wait, the conjugate transpose is a row vector. So χ† would be [ -3i, 4 ].

Wait, correct. So χ† is a 1x2 matrix: [ -3i, 4 ].

Now, the operator S_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So let me compute S_y χ first.

Let me compute S_y times χ. S_y is  (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

Multiplying S_y by χ: 

Each element of the resulting vector is the dot product of the corresponding row of S_y and χ.

First component: (0)*(3i) + (-i)*(4) = 0 + (-4i) = -4i.

Wait, but wait, S_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix. So each component is scaled by (ħ/2).

So after matrix multiplication, the components would be:

First entry: (0)*(3i) + (-i)*(4) = -4i.

Second entry: i*(3i) + 0*(4) = i*(3i) = 3i^2 = 3*(-1) = -3.

So the product S_y χ is (ħ/2) multiplied by [ -4i, -3 ]^T.

Wait, wait, let me double-check that matrix multiplication.

Wait, S_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by the matrix:

Row 1: 0, -i

Row 2: i, 0.

So when we multiply S_y (which is (ħ/2) times the matrix) by χ (which is [3i; 4]), we get:

First component: (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) = 0 + (-4i) = -4i. Multiply by (ħ/2) → (ħ/2)(-4i) = -2 ħ i.

Second component: (i)(3i) + (0)(4) = 3i^2 + 0 = 3*(-1) = -3. Multiply by (ħ/2) → (ħ/2)(-3) = -3 ħ/2.

So S_y χ is [ -2 ħ i, (-3 ħ)/2 ]^T.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, S_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by the matrix. So when you compute each component, you have to factor in the (ħ/2) scaling.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the matrix multiplication first without the scaling, and then multiply by (ħ/2).

So let me compute the matrix product without the (ħ/2) factor.

σ_y * χ = [ 0*3i + (-i)*4 , i*3i + 0*4 ]^T.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the matrix is 2x2 and χ is 2x1, so the result is 2x1.

So compute each row of σ_y times χ:

Row 1 of σ_y: [0, -i] multiplied by [3i; 4] → 0*3i + (-i)*4 = -4i.

Row 2 of σ_y: [i, 0] multiplied by [3i;4] → i*3i + 0*4 = 3i² = 3*(-1) = -3.

So σ_y χ is [ -4i, -3 ]^T.

Then S_y χ = (ħ/2) * [ -4i, -3 ]^T = [ (-4i ħ)/2, (-3 ħ)/2 ]^T → [ -2i ħ, (-3 ħ)/2 ]^T.

Wait, yes. So S_y χ = [ -2i ħ, (-3 ħ/2) ]^T.

Next, we need to compute χ† times S_y χ.

χ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

So χ† * S_y χ is the dot product of [ -3i, 4 ] and [ -2i ħ, (-3 ħ/2) ]^T.

Compute each term:

First term: (-3i) * (-2i ħ) = 6 i² ħ = 6*(-1)ħ = -6 ħ.

Second term: 4 * (-3 ħ/2) = (4 * (-3/2)) ħ = (-6) ħ.

So adding these two terms: (-6 ħ) + (-6 ħ) = -12 ħ.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the multiplication:

First term: (-3i) * (-2i ħ) = (3i * 2i ħ) * (-1)^2? Wait, better compute it step by step.

-3i multiplied by -2i ħ → (-3i) * (-2i ħ) = (3i)(2i ħ) ) → 6 i² ħ → 6*(-1) ħ → -6 ħ.

Second term: 4 * (-3 ħ/2) → 4 * (-3/2) = -6 → -6 ħ.

So total is (-6 ħ) + (-6 ħ) = -12 ħ.

Wait, but wait: the first term is (-3i) * (-2i ħ) = ?

Wait, (-3i) * (-2i) = 6 i² = 6(-1) = -6. Then multiply by ħ, so it's -6 ħ.

Wait, yeah, that's correct.

So the total is (-6 ħ) + (4 * (-3 ħ/2)) → 4*(-3/2) is -6, so another -6 ħ.

So sum is -12 ħ.

But wait, the expectation value is <S_y> = (1/25) (-12 ħ) ? Wait, where does 25 come into play?

Wait, no. Because before computing the expectation value, I should normalize the state. Oh wait! Because the state vector may not be normalized. Oh right! That's an important step.

So the state is [3i, 4]. The norm is the square of the magnitude, which is |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = ( (3)^2 ) + (4)^2 ) = 9 + 16 = 25. So the norm is sqrt(25)=5. So the normalized state is [3i,4]/5.

Ah, I almost forgot that part. So the state vector isn't necessarily normalized. So when calculating expectation values, we need to consider the normalized state.

So the actual state is χ = [3i; 4] / √25 → [3i/5, 4/5]^T.

So when computing the expectation value, it's χ† S_y χ, which would be ⟨S_y⟩ = (1/25) times the value I computed earlier because when I factor in the normalization.

Because χ is (1/5) [3i,4]^T → χ† is [ -3i/5, 4/5 ] and χ is [3i/5;4/5].

So perhaps I should recompute with the normalized state.

Alternatively, since the expectation value formula is:

⟨S_y⟩ = (1/⟨χ|χ⟩) * ⟨χ| S_y |χ⟩.

So first, compute ⟨χ|χ⟩.

⟨χ|χ⟩ = (3i)^* (3i) + (4)^* (4) → (-3i)(3i) + 4*4 → (-9 i²) + 16 → (-9*(-1)) +16 → 9 +16=25.

So ⟨χ|χ⟩=25.

Thus, the expectation is (⟨χ| S_y |χ⟩ ) /25.

Earlier, without normalization, when I computed χ† S_y χ, I got -12 ħ. But this was for the non-normalized state. So when normalized, it's (-12 ħ) / 25.

Wait no, because when I did the earlier calculation, I included the (ħ/2) factor in S_y. Let me re-do the calculation with the normalized state.

So let's recompute with the normalized χ and χ†.

First, χ is [3i/5, 4/5]^T.

χ† is [ -3i/5, 4/5 ].

S_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

So S_y χ is (ħ/2) * σ_y χ.

Compute σ_y χ first:

σ_y * [3i/5; 4/5] = [ (0)(3i/5) + (-i)(4/5) , (i)(3i/5) + (0)(4/5) ]^T.

Compute each component:

First component: 0 + (-i)(4/5) = (-4i/5).

Second component: i*(3i/5) = (3i²)/5 = (3*(-1))/5 = -3/5.

So σ_y χ is [(-4i/5), (-3/5)]^T.

Now, multiply by (ħ/2):

S_y χ = (ħ/2) * [ (-4i/5), (-3/5) ]^T → [ (-4i ħ )/(2*5), (-3 ħ )/(2*5) ) ]^T → [ (-2i ħ)/5, (-3 ħ)/(10) ]^T.

Now, compute χ† times S_y χ:

χ† is [ -3i/5, 4/5 ].

Dot product with S_y χ:

First term: (-3i/5) * (-2i ħ /5 ) → (6 i² ħ )/(25) → (6*(-1) ħ)/25 → (-6 ħ)/25.

Second term: (4/5) * (-3 ħ)/(10) → (4 * (-3) ħ )/(5*10) → (-12 ħ )/(50) → (-6 ħ )/(25).

Adding the two terms: (-6 ħ/25) + (-6 ħ/25) → (-12 ħ)/25.

So ⟨S_y⟩ = (-12 ħ)/25.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is -12 ħ/25, option B is 12 ħ/25.

So the expectation value is (-12 ħ)/25, which is option A.

To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( S_y \), for an electron in the spin state \( \chi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Normalization of the state**:  
   The norm of the state is \( \|\chi\| = \sqrt{|3i|^2 + |4|^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5 \).  
   The normalized state is \( \chi_{\text{norm}} = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 3i/5 \\ 4/5 \end{pmatrix} \).

2. **Operator \( S_y \)**:  
   The spin operator \( S_y \) is given by \( S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y \), where \( \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \).  
   Thus,  
   \[
   S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

3. **Compute \( S_y \chi_{\text{norm}} \)**:  
   First, compute \( \sigma_y \chi_{\text{norm}} \):  
   \[
   \sigma_y \chi_{\text{norm}} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3i/5 \\ 4/5 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} (0)(3i/5) + (-i)(4/5) \\ (i)(3i/5) + (0)(4/5) \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -4i/5 \\ -3/5 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]  
   Then, multiply by \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \):  
   \[
   S_y \chi_{\text{norm}} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} -4i/5 \\ -3/5 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -2i \hbar / 5 \\ -3 \hbar / 10 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

4. **Compute \( \chi_{\text{norm}}^\dagger S_y \chi_{\text{norm}} \)**:  
   The conjugate transpose of \( \chi_{\text{norm}} \) is \( \chi_{\text{norm}}^\dagger = \begin{pmatrix} -3i/5 & 4/5 \end{pmatrix} \).  
   The expectation value is:  
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \chi_{\text{norm}}^\dagger S_y \chi_{\text{norm}} = \begin{pmatrix} -3i/5 & 4/5 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} -2i \hbar / 5 \\ -3 \hbar / 10 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]  
   Compute the dot product:  
   - First term: \( (-3i/5)(-2i \hbar / 5) = (6 i^2 \hbar) / 25 = (-6 \hbar) / 25 \).  
   - Second term: \( (4/5)(-3 \hbar / 10) = (-12 \hbar) / 50 = (-6 \hbar) / 25 \).  
   Adding these:  
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = (-6 \hbar / 25) + (-6 \hbar / 25) = -12 \hbar / 25.
   \]

5. **Final Answer**:  
   The expectation value of \( S_y \) is \( -12 \hbar / 25 \), which corresponds to **Option A**.
