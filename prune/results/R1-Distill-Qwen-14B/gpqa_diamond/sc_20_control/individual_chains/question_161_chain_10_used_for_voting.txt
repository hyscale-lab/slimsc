Okay, so I've got this question about electron microscopes and mean free paths of gas molecules. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. 

So the scenario is about Mike designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. He uses vacuum pumps to get the sample compartment into an ultra-high vacuum, which is less than 10^-9 Torr. The idea is that with such low pressure, there are very few gas molecules around, which is good for electron microscopy because it reduces scattering and other issues.

But some gas particles are still there. Mike measured the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. Mean free path, I remember, is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. It depends on things like pressure, temperature, and the size of the molecules. The formula I think is λ = 1/(√2 n π d²), where n is number density and d is the diameter. Or wait, another formula I remember is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d^2 * p), where p is pressure. Oh wait, actually, the mean free path is also given by λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where P is the pressure. Because pressure is related to the number density.

So when Mike starts the electron beam, he notices that the mean free path changes to λ2. The question is, why would that be? And what can we conclude about λ2 compared to λ1?

Wait, the temperature of the sample compartment is the same. So temperature T is constant. The pressure is also the same (since the vacuum state is maintained), or wait, no. The pressure initially was such that the mean free path was λ1. But when the electron beam is turned on, maybe something changes. 

Wait, when the electron beam is on, the electrons are moving at high speeds. They might cause the gas molecules to scatter more. Because electrons have a certain energy, and when they hit the gas molecules, they could transfer momentum or cause the gas molecules to move more, maybe increasing the effective temperature? Or perhaps the gas molecules are ionized, which would change their behavior.

Alternatively, maybe the electron beam interacts with the gas, causing them to be excited or ionized, which could affect their collisional behavior. Another possibility is that the electron beam itself could heat the gas molecules, increasing the temperature locally. But the problem states that the sample compartment's temperature remained the same, so perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, but another thought: when the electron beam is on, the electrons are moving through the gas. Each time an electron scatters off a gas molecule, that could cause the gas molecule to gain some kinetic energy. So perhaps the mean free path would change if the gas's effective pressure changes. But wait, the pressure hasn't changed because the pumps are still working, so the overall pressure in the compartment is the same as before.

Alternatively, maybe the presence of the electron beam causes some of the gas molecules to be removed. For example, if the electrons cause the gas to be ionized, and then the ionized particles are pumped away more efficiently. But the question doesn't mention any change in pressure detected; the mass spectrometer probably just detected the presence of gas, but the pressure might remain the same.

Wait, perhaps another angle. The mean free path is determined by the collision rate. If the electron beam is on, the electrons are another source of collisions for the gas molecules. So the gas molecules would now be colliding not just with each other but also with the electrons. This would increase the collision rate, thereby decreasing the mean free path. Because the mean free path λ is inversely proportional to the collision frequency. So if there are more collisions (because of electrons), λ would be smaller.

So before, λ1 was based on gas-gas collisions only. But when the electron beam is on, gas-electron collisions add to the collisions, so the mean free path would be shorter. So λ2 would be less than λ1. So λ2 < λ1.

Looking at the options: 

Option C says λ2 < λ1. That would fit. So the correct answer should be C.

Wait, but are there any other factors? Could the electron beam affect the pressure? Well, if electrons are causing more gas to be pumped out, perhaps the pressure could drop. But the question says that the vacuum pumps are already maintaining a certain pressure, and the mass spectrometer detects the presence of gas but Mike accurately determined the mean free path before the electron beam was on. So perhaps the pressure remains the same, but now the effective collision rate is higher because of the electron beam.

So, initial mean free path λ1 is calculated without considering the electrons. Once the electrons are present, the gas molecules have more things to collide with (electrons), so the mean free path would decrease. So λ2 is less than λ1.

The question involves understanding the mean free path (λ) of gas molecules in a high-resolution transmission electron microscope under ultra-high vacuum conditions. Initially, Mike determines the mean free path of the gas molecules as λ1, based on factors such as pressure, temperature, and molecular size. However, upon initiating the electron beam, he observes a new mean free path, λ2, which is different from λ1.

The mean free path is inversely proportional to the collision rate of gas molecules. Initially, λ1 is determined under conditions where collisions occur only between gas molecules. When the electron beam is turned on, the electrons interact with the gas molecules, introducing an additional source of collisions. This increased collision rate reduces the average distance a gas molecule travels between collisions, thereby decreasing the mean free path. Since the temperature of the sample compartment remains constant and the vacuum pumps maintain the same pressure, the only change is the additional scattering caused by the electron beam. As a result, λ2 becomes shorter than λ1.

Analyzing the options:

- **A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1**: This is incorrect because the mean free path decreases due to additional collisions caused by the electron beam.
- **B) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation**: This is incorrect because the electron beam introduces new scattering events, which alter the mean free path.
- **C) λ2 < λ1**: This is correct because the additional collisions with the electron beam reduce the mean free path.
- **D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1**: This is incorrect because λ2 cannot be greater than λ1; it must be smaller due to the increased collision rate.

Thus, the correct conclusion is that λ2 < λ1.
