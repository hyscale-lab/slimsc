Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty on the topic, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a rhombohedral crystal's (111) plane. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distance is related to the crystal structure and the Miller indices.

First, I need to recall what a rhombohedral crystal is. Oh right, a rhombohedral system is one where all the lattice parameters are equal, and all the angles between the axes are the same. In this case, alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. Wait, but wait, I think in a rhombohedral system, the angles aren't necessarily all the same as in the cubic system. Or maybe they are? I'm a bit confused. Oh no, wait! No, in a rhombohedral system, the three lattice parameters a, b, c are equal, and the angles between them can be different. Or wait, maybe all the angles are equal? Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, the question says the angles are all 30 degrees. So each angle alpha, beta, gamma is 30 degrees. So it's a rhombohedral crystal with a = b = c, and angles 30°. So it's a special case, perhaps similar to a cubic system but with different angles. I think that's correct.

Now, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. I think that's the lattice parameter a. Wait, no, the interatomic distance is the distance between adjacent atoms in the lattice, which for a simple cubic structure would be the same as the lattice parameter a. But in a rhombohedral structure, the atoms are at the lattice points, so the interatomic distance is the same as a. So a is 10 Angstrom.

The question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Oh, right, interplanar distance d is given by the formula involving the Miller indices and the lattice parameters. I remember the formula is d = a/(sqrt(h² + k² + l² + ... something with the angles...)), but wait, the exact formula is a bit foggy. Oh right, for a general crystal system, the interplanar distance is calculated using the formula involving the reciprocal of the lattice parameters and the angles between the axes.

The general formula for interplanar distance d_{hkl} is:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h²/l² + k²/m² + l²/n²) ) )

Wait, no, that's not right. Oh wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the structure factor or the reflection conditions. No, maybe I need to think about the relation between the reciprocal lattice and the interplanar distances.

Wait, let me get the correct formula. The formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles alpha, beta, gamma is:

1/d² = (h²)/(a²) + (k²)/(b²) + (l²)/(c²) + 2hk cos gamma / (a b) + 2hl cos beta / (a c) + 2kl cos alpha / (b c)

But wait, wait. I think I might have that wrong. Let me think again. No, for a triclinic system (which is the most general), the formula is as above. But in this case, we have a rhombohedral system where a = b = c, and alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees. Oh, that simplifies things a bit.

So substituting a = b = c = 10 Angstrom, and angles of 30 degrees.

So the formula for 1/d² simplifies. Let's plug in h, k, l as 1,1,1 since it's the (111) plane.

So 1/d² = (1²)/(a²) + (1²)/(a²) + (1²)/(a²) + 2*(1*1)*cos(gamma)/(a²) + 2*(1*1)*cos(beta)/(a²) + 2*(1*1)*cos(alpha)/(a²).

Wait, wait, no. Let me correct. The formula is:

1/d^2 = (h²)/(a²) + (k²)/(b²) + (l²)/(c²) + 2 hk (cos gamma)/(ab) + 2 hl (cos beta)/(ac) + 2 kl (cos alpha)/(bc)

But since a = b = c = a0, say, then:

1/d^2 = (h² + k² + l²)/a0² + 2 [hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha ] / a0²

Because each denominator term like ab becomes a^2, and similar for others.

So for the (111) plane, h=k=l=1.

So plugging in:

1/d^2 = (1 + 1 + 1)/a0² + 2 [ (1*1)*cos(30) + (1*1)*cos(30) + (1*1)*cos(30) ] / a0²

Simplify that:

1/d² = (3 + 2*(3 * cos 30)) ) / a0²

Wait, let me compute that again.

Wait, the second part is 2*(hk cos gamma + ...). Let me compute hk cos gamma.

Wait, in the formula, it's 2 hk cos gamma/(a b). But since a = b = c, it's 2 hk cos gamma/(a^2). So each term in the brackets is (hk cos gamma)/(a^2), but multiplied by 2 and summed.

Wait, no, the term is 2 hk cos gamma/(a b). Since a = b = c, this becomes 2 hk cos gamma/(a²). Similarly for the other terms.

So for h=1, k=1, l=1:

1/d² = (1/1² + 1/1² + 1/1²) + 2 [ (1*1 cos 30) + (1*1 cos 30) + (1*1 cos 30) ] / (1^2)

Wait, because a=b=c=10, so a^2 is 100. But let me compute the terms.

Wait, let me factor a^2.

1/d² = (h² + k² + l² + 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha )) / a²

Because the denominators all become a².

So in the case of (111), it's (1+1+1) + 2*(1*1 cos 30 + 1*1 cos 30 + 1*1 cos 30 )

So that's 3 + 2*(3 * cos 30° )

Wait, cos 30 is sqrt(3)/2 approx 0.8660.

So 3 + 2*3*(sqrt(3)/2) = 3 + 3*sqrt(3).

So 3 + 3*1.732 ≈ 3 + 5.196 = 8.196.

Wait, 3*sqrt(3) is approximately 5.196, yes.

So 1/d² = (8.196) / (a²)

But a is 10 Angstrom, so a² is 100.

So 1/d² = 8.196 / 100 → d² = 100 / 8.196 → d = sqrt(100 / 8.196 )

Let me compute 100 / 8.196. Let's see, 8 * 12.5 is 100, but 8.196 is a bit more than 8, so 100/8 is 12.5, but 8.196 is 8 + 0.196, so 100 /8.196 ≈ 12.207.

So d ≈ sqrt(12.207) ≈ 3.494 Angstrom? Wait, wait, that can't be right because the options are around 9 Angstrom. Oh wait, wait, no, I think I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait wait, because I think I messed up the formula. Let me go back.

The correct formula for interplanar distance is:

1/d² = (h²)/(a²) + (k²)/(b²) + (l²)/(c²) + 2 hk cos gamma/(a b) + 2 hl cos beta/(a c) + 2 kl cos alpha/(b c)

But in this case, a = b = c. Let me denote a = b = c = a0.

So substituting:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/a0² + 2 [ hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha ] / a0²

So grouping terms:

1/d² = [ h² + k² + l² + 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) ] / a0²

So for (111):

= [1 + 1 +1 + 2(1*1 * cos 30 + 1*1 * cos 30 + 1*1 * cos 30 ) ] / a0²

So that's:

3 + 2*(3 * cos 30° ) → 3 + 6 * (√3/2) → 3 + 3√3 ≈ 3 + 5.196 = 8.196

So 1/d² = 8.196 / (10)^2 → 8.196 / 100 → 0.08196

Then d² = 1 / 0.08196 → approximately 12.207

So d ≈ sqrt(12.207) → around 3.494 Angstrom. That's way smaller than the options given. Hmm, options are around 8-10 Angstrom. So I must have messed up.

Wait, that can't be right. The interplanar distance can't be smaller than the interatomic distance. Wait, no, depends on the plane. For example, in a cubic system, (111) planes have d = a/(sqrt(3)) which is about 5.77 Angstrom for a=10. But in this case, the angles are smaller, so the interplanar distance might be larger. Hmm, but according to my calculation, d is 3.494, which is even smaller than that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. Maybe I confused a and c or the angles.

Wait, the formula I used is correct? Let me double-check. Another approach: in a rhombohedral system, when a = b = c and all angles are equal, it's called a cubic system only if all angles are 90 degrees. Since the angles are 30 degrees, it's a rhombohedral system.

Wait, I think another way to compute this is using the volume of the unit cell and the reciprocal lattice vectors. Because the interplanar distance is related to the reciprocal lattice.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the reciprocal lattice vectors. The reciprocal lattice vector components are given by:

h = (1/a) * (1, 0, 0)
k = (1/b) * (cos gamma, sin gamma, 0)
l = (1/c) * [cos beta, cos alpha / sin gamma, sqrt(1 - (cos^2 beta) - (cos alpha cos beta)/(sin gamma)) ]

Wait, that might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for d-spacing in terms of the structure factor.

Wait, another approach: in a rhombohedral system with a = b = c and angles alpha, the d-spacing for (hkl) planes is:

d = [ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2 - 2hk cos(180 - alpha) - 2hl cos(180 - alpha) - 2kl cos(180 - alpha)) / a^2 ]^(-1/2)

Wait, no, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula as given in some crystallography resource.

Wait, I remember that for a cubic system, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But in a cubic system, angles are 90 degrees. So in this case, with angles of 30 degrees, it's more complicated.

Wait, another approach: the interplanar distance d is the reciprocal of the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector.

The reciprocal lattice vector G for (hkl) is given by:

G = h a* + k b* + l c*

Where a*, b*, c* are the reciprocal basis vectors.

But in the case of a rhombohedral system with a = b = c and angles alpha = beta = gamma, the reciprocal vectors can be expressed in terms of the direct lattice vectors.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the formula I had before but check the numbers again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me re-express the 1/d² expression correctly.

Wait, another way: the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles alpha, beta, gamma is:

1/d² = (h² sin² beta sin² gamma + k² sin² alpha sin² gamma + l² sin² alpha sin² beta - 2hk sin alpha sin beta cos gamma - 2hl sin alpha sin gamma cos beta - 2kl sin beta sin gamma cos alpha ) / ( V^2 )

Where V is the volume of the unit cell.

Wait, I think I remember a formula involving the volume. Let me compute V first.

The volume V of a rhombohedral unit cell is given by:

V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - cos² alpha - cos² beta - cos² gamma + 2 cos alpha cos beta cos gamma )

But since alpha = beta = gamma = 30°, let's compute this.

cos 30° = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So, 1 - 3*(cos^2 30) + 2*(cos 30)^3.

Wait, let's compute each term:

cos² 30 = (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4 = 0.75.

So 3 * 0.75 = 2.25.

2*(cos 30)^3 = 2*( (sqrt(3)/2)^3 ) = 2*( (3*sqrt(3))/8 ) = (3*sqrt(3))/4 ≈ (3 * 1.732) /4 ≈ 5.196 /4 ≈ 1.299.

So, V^2 = a^6 [ 1 - 3*(0.75) + 2*( (sqrt(3)/2)^3 ) ]

Wait, no, the volume V is a^3 multiplied by sqrt(1 - sum of cos² terms + 2 product of cos terms).

So:

Inside the sqrt, it's 1 - (3 * 0.75) + 2*( (sqrt(3)/2)^3 )

So 1 - 2.25 + 2*( (3*sqrt(3))/8 )

= (1 - 2.25) + (3*sqrt(3))/4 )

= (-1.25) + (approx 1.299 )

= approx 0.049.

Wait, that's a very small number. So sqrt(0.049) is about 0.221.

So V = a^3 * 0.221.

But a is 10 Angstrom, so V = 1000 * 0.221 = 221 Ang^3.

Wait, but I'm not sure if this is correct. Maybe my approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the Miller indices formula correctly and proceed step by step.

So, given that a = b = c = 10 Ang, and alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees.

Compute 1/d² for (hkl) = (1,1,1):

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) + 2 (hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha )/(a²)

Wait, I think I had that correct earlier.

So substituting:

h=1, k=1, l=1.

1/d² = (1 + 1 + 1)/(10)^2 + 2 [ (1*1 * cos 30) + (1*1 cos 30) + (1*1 cos 30) ] / (10)^2

So,

= 3/(100) + 2*(3 * cos 30° )/100

= 0.03 + (6 * 0.8660)/100

= 0.03 + (5.196)/100

= 0.03 + 0.05196

= 0.08196.

So 1/d² = 0.08196 → d² = 1 / 0.08196 ≈ 12.207 → d ≈ 3.494 Ang.

But that can't be right because the interplanar distance shouldn't be less than the interatomic distance, but wait, no, because the (111) planes are closer together than the interatomic distance. Wait, no, wait, in a cubic system, the (111) planes have d = a / sqrt(3) ≈ 5.77 Ang for a=10. So this is smaller than that, which makes sense because the planes are closer together (smaller d) when the angles are smaller. Because in this case, the angles between the lattice vectors are 30 degrees, which is smaller than 90 degrees, so maybe the planes are closer.

But according to the answer options, the correct d is around 8-10 Ang, so clearly something's wrong.

Wait, perhaps I confused interatomic distance with a. Because interatomic distance is the distance between neighboring atoms, which in a simple cubic structure is a. But in a rhombohedral structure, perhaps the interatomic distance is a? Or maybe it's different.

Wait, the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Ang. So a = 10 Ang.

Wait, maybe I have the formula inverted. Oh wait, no, interplanar distance is d, which for (111) in a cubic system is a/sqrt(3) ≈ 5.77 Ang for a=10. So why is my calculation giving 3.494 Ang? That's even smaller. That doesn't align with the options either.

Wait, perhaps I made a calculation mistake in the 1/d² formula.

Let me recompute:

1/d² = (1 + 1 + 1 + 2*(1*1*cos 30 + 1*1*cos 30 + 1*1*cos 30 )) / (10)^2

Wait, no, the formula is 1/d² = (h² +k² + l² + 2hk cos gamma + 2hl cos beta + 2kl cos alpha ) / a².

Wait, wait a second, perhaps the formula is 1/d² = (h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos gamma + 2hl cos beta + 2kl cos alpha ) / (a²)

Wait, wait, maybe I forgot that in the formula, the angles are the angles between the axes, which are 30 degrees each. But in the formula, perhaps the signs are different.

Wait, I think I might have mixed up the angles. Because in the formula, the angle between a and b is gamma? Or is it alpha, beta, gamma defined in a different way?

Wait, no, I think in the standard formula, the angles are: alpha is the angle between b and c axes, beta between a and c, gamma between a and b? Or perhaps I got the axes mixed up.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe someone else would explain it with a mnemonic.

Wait, in the standard notation, alpha is the angle between the b and c axes, beta between a and c, and gamma between a and b. Wait, no, perhaps it's the other way around. Or perhaps I should think of the unit cell as having vectors a, b, c, with angles between a and b being gamma, between a and c beta, and between b and c alpha.

Wait, that's probably correct. So, alpha is the angle between the b and c vectors. Beta is between a and c. Gamma is between a and b.

So, for a rhombohedral system, all three angles are 30 degrees.

So, substituting into the formula:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos gamma + 2hl cos beta + 2kl cos alpha ) / a².

So, for (111), h=k=l=1.

So:

1/d² = (3) + 2*( cos gamma + cos beta + cos alpha ) / (a²)

Wait, because 2*(1*1 cos gamma + 1*1 cos beta + 1*1 cos alpha )

Since gamma, beta, alpha are all 30 degrees, cos 30 is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So, 1/d² = [3 + 2*(0.866 + 0.866 + 0.866) ] / (10)^2

= [3 + 2*(2.598) ] / 100

= [3 + 5.196 ] / 100

= 8.196 / 100 → 0.08196 → d² = 1/0.08196 ≈ 12.207 → d ≈ 3.494.

Same result as before. Hmm, but the options are all around 9 Ang. So I'm either making a mistake in the formula or miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Let me think again.

Wait, wait a minute. Maybe the formula is 1/d² = (4/3) (h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos(gamma) + 2hl cos(beta) + 2kl cos(alpha)) / a².

No, that doesn't ring a bell. Alternatively, perhaps I should be using the volume in the formula.

Wait, another approach: the interplanar distance d is given by d = (a^2 (h² + k² + l²) )^(1/2) / (sqrt(...)) ?

Hmm, perhaps I should look for an alternative formula. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the structure factor, but that might complicate things.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the angles in the formula. For example, in the formula, perhaps the angle used is 180 - alpha instead of alpha. Because when the angle between vectors is 30 degrees, the angle in the formula might be 150 degrees? Because in the structure factor formula, the angles might be the angles in the reciprocal space.

Wait, wait, I think I may have made a mistake with the angles. Because in the formula for interplanar distance, the angles used are the angles in the reciprocal lattice, which are 180 - the angles in the direct lattice. Or maybe not. I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, no, I think the formula uses the same angles as the direct lattice. Let me think: the angle between a and b is gamma. So in the formula, we use cos gamma.

Wait, perhaps I should check a simple case. Let's consider a cubic system, where all angles are 90 degrees. So cos gamma = cos 90 = 0. So the formula becomes 1/d² = (h² +k² + l² ) / a². So d = a / sqrt(h² +k² + l² ), which is correct.

So in that case, the formula works. So in our case, it's okay.

Hmm, but the result I get is around 3.49 Ang, which is not among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps I have the formula inverted. Maybe 1/d^2 is proportional to (h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + ...), but perhaps I should have 1/d^2 = ( ... ) / (a^2), but I could have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, if the interplanar distance is 3.49 Ang, and the options are about 9 Ang, perhaps I forgot to take the reciprocal somewhere. Let me see.

Wait, 1/d² = 0.08196 → d² = 12.207 → d ≈ 3.494.

If I made a mistake in the formula and actually d is 10 / sqrt(8.196), which would be d ≈ 10 / 2.864 ≈ 3.494. So that's the same result.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. So perhaps the formula is different. Maybe I should use another approach.

Wait, perhaps I should use the extinction conditions or some other property.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different definition of the rhombohedral system. Wait, another thought: perhaps in a rhombohedral system, the angle between the vectors is 30 degrees, but the angle between the planes is different. Or perhaps I should be using the supplementary angles.

Another idea: perhaps the formula for d is different. Let me recall that in a cubic system, the interplanar distance for (111) is a / sqrt(3), which is about 5.77 Ang for a=10. But in our case, the d is smaller, as the angles are smaller.

Wait, but the options are around 9 Ang, which is larger than a. That doesn't make sense because the interplanar distance for (111) in a cubic system is a/sqrt(3) ≈ 5.77, which is less than a.

Wait, but perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Let me try to find another approach.

Wait, another way to compute d is using the following formula:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) )

In this case, for (111):

d = 10 / sqrt(3 + 2*(1*1 cos 30 + 1*1 cos 30 + 1*1 cos 30) )

= 10 / sqrt(3 + 2*(3 * 0.8660) )

= 10 / sqrt(3 + 5.196 )

= 10 / sqrt(8.196 )

Calculating sqrt(8.196): let's compute 2.86^2 = 8.1796, 2.86^2=8.1796, 2.862^2 is approx 8.196. So sqrt(8.196)= ~2.862.

So d=10 / 2.862 ≈ 3.494 Ang, same as before.

So this isn't matching any of the options provided. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is not a, but something else. Wait, the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Ang. Hmm, in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is a, but in a rhombohedral structure, perhaps the interatomic distance is a multiplied by some factor based on the angles.

Wait, no, because in a rhombohedral structure, the atoms are at the corners, so the distance between neighboring atoms along the lattice vectors is a. But the interatomic distance might be the same as a, because the atoms are at the lattice points.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the distance between nearest neighbors, which in a rhombohedral structure would be a, so a=10.

But according to our calculations, that gives d=3.494, which isn't present in the options.

Wait, perhaps the given angles are 30 degrees, but in reality, the angles in the formula are 180-30=150 degrees. Let me try that.

So cos(150) is -sqrt(3)/2 ≈ -0.866.

So 1/d² = 3 + 2*( -0.866 -0.866 -0.866 ) /100.

So 3 + 2*(-2.598) → 3 -5.196 → -2.196.

Wait, 1/d² can't be negative, so that's impossible. So that approach is wrong.

Hmm, what else could I be missing?

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the angles between the reciprocal axes. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that in a rhombohedral system, the d-spacing formula is different. For example, I found a formula online (but can't access now) that for rhombohedral systems, d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos theta ), where theta is the angle between the lattice vectors.

In our case, theta is 30 degrees.

So for (111), it's:

d = 10 / sqrt(3 + 2*(1 +1 +1) * cos 30 )

= 10 / sqrt(3 + 6 * 0.866 )

= 10 / sqrt(3 +5.196 )

= 10 / sqrt(8.196 ) ≈3.494.

Same result again. So I must have made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I confused the interplanar distance with the reciprocal of d. But no, the formula gives d.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the (111) plane, but I calculated for (111) in the direct lattice, but perhaps it's in the reciprocal lattice. No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I should invert the formula. Let me try:

If 1/d² = 0.08196 → d² =12.207 → d=3.494.

But the options are about 9 Ang. So 3.494 is way off.

Wait, perhaps I should have divided by 3 instead of adding 3.

Wait, let me try another approach. Let's think about the unit cell vectors.

In a rhombohedral system, the lattice vectors are a, b, c, each of length 10 Ang, and each pair forms an angle of 30 degrees.

The (111) plane is defined by the plane intercepting the a, b, c axes at (1,1,1). So the normal vector to this plane is (1,1,1).

The interplanar distance d is the reciprocal of the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector.

Wait, the reciprocal lattice vector is given by G = h a* + k b* + l c*, where a*, b*, c* are the reciprocal basis vectors.

But perhaps another way to compute the magnitude of G is |G| = sqrt( (h/a)^2 + (k/b)^2 + (l/c)^2 + ... terms involving cosines ... )

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the distance between two adjacent lattice planes, which is the interplanar distance.

But I'm not sure. Another approach: Using the volume of the unit cell.

The volume V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - cos^2 α - cos^2 β - cos^2 γ + 2 cos α cos β cos γ )

As before, substituting α=β=γ=30°, cos 30 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So,

V = (10)^3 * sqrt(1 - 3*(0.75) + 2*(0.866)^3 )

= 1000 * sqrt(1 - 2.25 + 2*(0.6495) )

= 1000 * sqrt( (-1.25) + 1.299 )

= 1000 * sqrt(0.049 )

sqrt(0.049) ≈0.2214 → V≈ 221.4 Ang^3.

Now, the interplanar distance d for (111) is given by:

d = V / ( | (a × b) · c | )

Wait, no, that's the formula for the volume, not the interplanar distance.

Wait, perhaps another formula: the distance between two adjacent planes is given by d = (a × b · c) / V.

Wait, no, more accurately, the interplanar distance is given by d = 1/ sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) * (1/a^2) + ... ) ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for d in terms of the volume and the Miller indices.

Another formula I found is d = sqrt( (a^2 (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) ) / ( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ ) ) ), where theta is the angle between the lattice vectors.

Wait, so in our case, theta = 30°, and h=k=l=1.

So,

d = sqrt( (10^2 *3 ) / (3 + 6 * cos 30 ) )

= sqrt( (300) / (3 +6*(0.866)) )

= sqrt( 300 / (3 +5.196) )

= sqrt(300 / 8.196 )

300 /8.196 ≈36.6 → sqrt(36.6)=6.05.

Hmm, that's about 6 Ang, which still doesn't match the options. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Let me think again.

Ah! Wait, I think I forgot to consider that the formula for d-spacing in a rhombohedral system is:

1/d² = (h² +k² + l² + 2 hk cos α + 2 hl cos β + 2 kl cos γ )/(a²)

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the angles are in a different order.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

1/d² = (h² +k² + l² + 2 hk cos γ + 2 hl cos β + 2 kl cos α ) / a².

Wait, but that's the same as before. Because alpha is between a and c, beta between a and b, and gamma between b and c? Or wait, perhaps I have to consider the correct order of the angles.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the formula is 1/d² = (h² +k² + l² + 2hk cos(180 - gamma) + 2hl cos(180 - gamma) + 2kl cos(180 - gamma) ) /a².

Because the angle between the lattice vectors might be 180 - gamma.

Wait, let's see: cos(180 - gamma) = -cos gamma.

So,

1/d² = [3 + 2*(1*1*(-0.866) + 1*1*(-0.866) + 1*1*(-0.866)) ] / 100.

= [3 + 2*(-2.598) ] / 100.

= [3 -5.196 ] /100 → (-2.196)/100 → 1/d² is negative, which is impossible. So that can't be right.

Hmm, this is getting frustrating. All the approaches I'm taking are leading to d ≈3.494, but the options are much larger.

Wait, perhaps the given angles are 30 degrees, but I should have used 60 degrees. Because 30 degrees is a very sharp angle, perhaps I made a mistake there.

Wait, but the question says the angles are 30 degrees. So that's not the issue.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the formula uses the reciprocal of the angles. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the formula is correct, but I made a mistake in the calculation.

Let me recompute 1/d².

1/d² = (3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2 )) / 100 → (3 + 3*sqrt(3)) / 100 → (3 +5.196)/100 → 8.196/100 = 0.08196.

So 1/d² =0.08196 → d = sqrt(1/0.08196) → sqrt(12.207)=3.494 Ang.

Wait, but the options are all around 9 Ang. I'm clearly missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about a primitive rhombohedral lattice but a face-centered or body-centered one. But rhombohedral systems are usually primitive, so that might not apply.

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is the distance between two atoms along the (111) direction, not along the lattice vectors. But that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula and should use the simple cubic formula, but that leads to d=5.77 which isn't an option either.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is 1/d² = (h² +k² + l²) /a² + 2 (hk cos(180 - gamma) + ... )

Wait, but that would give negative values, which I think is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the length of the reciprocal vector.

The reciprocal lattice vector for (111) is:

G = h a* + k b* + l c*

But for a rhombohedral system with a = b = c =10, and angles between vectors as 30°, the reciprocal vectors can be calculated as:

a* = (1/a) ( 1, 0, 0 ) → (0.1, 0, 0 )

b* = (1/a) ( cos gamma, sin gamma, 0 ) → ( cos30, sin30, 0 ) *0.1 → (0.866*0.1, 0.5 *0.1, 0 ) → (0.0866, 0.05, 0 )

c* = (1/a) ( cos beta, cos alpha / sin gamma, sqrt(1 - cos² beta - (cos alpha cos beta)/sin² gamma) )

Wait, but with alpha=beta=gamma=30°, let's compute c*.

Compute sin gamma: sin30=0.5.

So,

c* = (1/10) [ cos30, (cos30)/(sin30), sqrt(1 - cos²30 - (cos30 cos30)/(sin²30) ) ]

Compute each component:

cos30 = 0.866.

cos30 / sin30 = 0.866 /0.5 = 1.732.

The third component:

1 - (0.866)^2 - (0.866 * 0.866)/(0.5^2 )

= 1 - 0.75 - (0.75)/(0.25 )

= 1 -0.75 -3 → 1 -3.75 → -2.75.

sqrt of a negative number is impossible. So something's wrong here.

Wait, this suggests that perhaps the approach is incorrect because the third component is imaginary, which can't be right. So perhaps there's a mistake in the way the reciprocal vectors are calculated.

Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I should use a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system as:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

where theta is 30 degrees.

So for (111):

d = 10 / sqrt(3 + 6*(0.866) )

= 10 / sqrt(3 +5.196 ) → same as before, 10/2.862 → ~3.494 Ang.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the reciprocal of d, which is 3.494. The reciprocal is ~0.286, which is nowhere near the options.

Hmm. Another approach: perhaps the given interatomic distance is the nearest neighbor distance along the (111) direction, not along the lattice vectors. But that's more complicated.

Wait, the nearest neighbor distance in a rhombohedral lattice is a, which is along the lattice vectors. So that doesn't help.

Wait, perhaps I should use the face diagonal or something else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula and should consider the Miller indices as (222) instead of (111). Let's see:

If (222), then:

1/d² = (4 +4 +4 + 2*(4*0.866 +4*0.866 +4*0.866 )) / 100

= (12 + 2*(12*0.866) )/100

= (12 + 20.784 )/100 → 32.784/100 → 0.32784 → d²=3.05 → d≈1.747.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider (200) plane.

1/d² = (4 +0 +0 + 2*(0 +0 +0 ) ) → 4/100 → d=5 Ang. Still not matching.

Wait, maybe the formula is different. I found another formula online: For a rhombohedral system, the distance between (hkl) planes is:

d = a ( sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos γ + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos α ) )^{-1}

Which is the same as the formula I've been using.

So I'm confident the formula is correct, but why am I not getting the right answer.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it numerically again.

Compute 1/d² = (3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2 )) /100

= [3 + 6*(0.8660 ) ] / 100 → 3 +5.196 → 8.196 → 8.196 /100 → 0.08196.

So d² =1/0.08196 → 12.207 → d≈3.494.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the angles. Suppose the angles are 60 degrees instead of 30. Let's try that.

cos60=0.5.

1/d² = (3 + 2*(3 *0.5 )) /100 → (3 +3 )/100 →6/100 →0.06 → d= sqrt(1/0.06 )=4.082.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the angles are 60 degrees. But the question says 30 degrees.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula should use 2 times the angles.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the formula uses 2*alpha, 2*beta, 2*gamma. Let's try that.

So, 2*30=60 degrees.

cos60=0.5.

So,

1/d²= (3 + 2*(3*0.5 )) /100 → (3 +3 )/100 →6/100=0.06 →d≈4.082.

Again, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the angles are taken as 180-30=150 degrees. Let's compute cos(150)= -sqrt(3)/2 ≈-0.866.

So,

1/d²= (3 +2*(3*(-0.866)) )/100 → (3 -5.196 )/100 → (-2.196)/100 → negative. Impossible.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the interplanar distance is calculated using the face-centered cubic approach, but no, the question is about a rhombohedral crystal.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is not the lattice parameter a, but the distance between two adjacent atoms in the basis. For example, in a basis of two atoms, the distance could be different. But the question says it's a rhombohedral crystal, which is usually a primitive lattice, so I don't think that's the case.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is given as 10 Ang, which is the distance between the two atoms in the basis. But that complicates things because I don't know the structure of the basis.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recall that in a simple cubic system, the (111) planes have d = a/sqrt(3). For a=10, that's about 5.77 Ang. But our calculation for the rhombohedral system leads to a smaller d. So perhaps the answer is not listed, but that's unlikely.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is 9.54 Ang, which is about 10 / sqrt(1.048). That would imply a much smaller denominator. But according to our calculation, it's about 3.494.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the formula. Let me recheck the coefficients.

Wait, the formula is:

1/d² = (h² +k² +l² + 2hk cos gamma + 2hl cos beta + 2kl cos alpha ) / a².

Ah! Wait, maybe I should have considered that for the rhombohedral system, all the angles are same, so the formula becomes:

1/d² = (h² +k² +l² + 2hk cos(30) + 2hl cos(30) + 2kl cos(30) ) / a².

So for (111), that's:

1/d² = [3 + 2*(3 * cos30) ] /100 → [3 + 5.196 ] /100 → 8.196/100 → same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the formula is 1/d² = (h² +k² +l²)/a² + (2 hk cos gamma)/(ab) + (2 hl cos beta)/(ac) + (2 kl cos alpha)/(bc).

But since a=b=c, each denominator is a².

So,

1/d² = [3 + 2*( 3 * cos30 ) ] / a² → same as before.

Hmm.

I'm out of ideas. I think I must conclude that according to my calculations, the correct answer is approximately 3.494 Angstrom, but that's not among the options. This suggests that I made a mistake in my approach somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the interatomic distance in the (111) direction. The interatomic distance along (111) would be a * sqrt(1 +1 +1 + 2(1+1+1) cos30° ).

Wait, no, that's the length of the vector (1,1,1) in the lattice. The length would be sqrt(1^2 +1^2 +1^2 + 2(1*1 cos30 + 1*1 cos30 +1*1 cos30 )) → sqrt(3 + 6*0.866) → sqrt(3 +5.196) → sqrt(8.196) →≈2.862.

But that's the length in lattice units. Multiply by a=10 →28.62, which is much larger than the options. But the interplanar distance is about 3.494, which is not an option.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. Maybe the correct answer isn't provided, but that's unlikely. Perhaps I should look for a calculation error.

Wait, let me compute 1/d² again.

h² +k² +l² =3.

2*(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha ) = 2*(1*1 *0.866 + 1*1*0.866 + 1*1*0.866 )=2*(2.598)=5.196.

So 3 +5.196=8.196.

Divide by a²=100 → 0.08196.

d²=1/0.08196=12.207 → d=3.494.

Yes, that's correct. So none of the options match.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for d in terms of the volume and the indices.

The volume V is a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3*(0.75) + 2*(0.866)^3) → a^3 * sqrt(1 -2.25 + 1.299 ) → a^3 * sqrt(0.049) → a^3 *0.2214 → (10)^3 *0.2214=221.4 Ang^3.

The formula for d is (V) / (hkl . (1,1,1) cross product or something else). Wait, perhaps the formula is d = V / (sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + ... )).

Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula involving the structure factor.

Wait, perhaps the formula for d is:

d = sqrt( (a^2 (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) ) / ( (h +k +l)^2 ) )

No, that would be for a hexagonal or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I should give up and consider that the correct answer is not listed. But since the options don't have it, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) )

In that case, for (111):

d=10 / sqrt(3 +6 )=10/sqrt(9)=10/3≈3.333 Ang. Still not matching.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the (110) plane instead of (111). Let's try that.

For (110), h=1,k=1,l=0.

1/d² = (1 +1 +0) + 2*(1*1 cos30 +1*0 cos30 +1*0 cos30 ) → (2) + 2*(0.866 )= 2 +1.732=3.732.

So 1/d²=3.732/100=0.03732 → d=5.05 Ang.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the question has a typo, but I can't know.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the reciprocal of the d value I obtained, but that's 2.862, which isn't in the options.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the reciprocal of the reciprocal lattice vector. But that's same as d.

Hmm.

I'm really stuck. I think the correct d is 3.494 Ang, but none of the options match. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + (hk + hl + kl) )

In that case, for (111):

d=10 / sqrt(3 +3 ) → 10/sqrt(6)=4.082 Ang.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - (hk + hl +kl) )

Which would give d=10/sqrt(3-3)=infinite. No.

Hmm.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the question is using the face-centered cubic formula, which for (111) is a/sqrt(3), but that would be 5.77 for a=10, which is again not in the options.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another formula for rhombohedral systems.

After some research, I find that the correct formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

1/d² = (h² +k² +l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ ) / a²,

where θ is the angle between the lattice vectors. So for our case, θ=30°, and h=k=l=1.

So,

1/d² = (3 + 6 * cos 30° ) / 100 → (3 + 6*(0.866) )/100 → (3 +5.196)/100 → 8.196/100 → 0.08196.

So, d=3.494 Ang. Still no match.

Hmm, perhaps the angles are actually 60 degrees. Let's compute that.

cos60=0.5.

1/d² = (3 +6*0.5 )/100 → (3+3)/100=6/100=0.06 → d=4.082 Ang. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the angles are 90 degrees, making it a cubic system.

Then, cos90=0.

1/d²=3/100 → d=5.77 Ang. Again, not an option.

Wait, perhaps the question uses the reciprocal of the formula. So 1/d=3.494 → d=0.286, but that's not an option.

I'm really stuck. I think I've done everything I can, but I can't find an answer that matches the options. I'll have to make an educated guess. But I can't see how any of the options match the correct calculation.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the interplanar distance \( d \) for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal with interatomic distance \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \) and angles \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \), the formula for interplanar distance is used:

\[
\frac{1}{d^2} = \frac{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk \cos \gamma + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \alpha)}{a^2}
\]

For the (111) plane, \( h = k = l = 1 \). Substituting the values:

\[
\frac{1}{d^2} = \frac{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 2(1 \cdot 1 \cdot \cos 30^\circ + 1 \cdot 1 \cdot \cos 30^\circ + 1 \cdot 1 \cdot \cos 30^\circ)}{10^2}
\]

\[
\frac{1}{d^2} = \frac{3 + 2(3 \cdot \cos 30^\circ)}{100}
\]

Since \( \cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866 \):

\[
\frac{1}{d^2} = \frac{3 + 2(3 \cdot 0.866)}{100}
\]

\[
\frac{1}{d^2} = \frac{3 + 5.196}{100}
\]

\[
\frac{1}{d^2} = \frac{8.196}{100}
\]

\[
d^2 = \frac{1}{0.08196}
\]

\[
d^2 \approx 12.207
\]

\[
d \approx \sqrt{12.207} \approx 3.494 \, \text{Å}
\]

This result, approximately \( 3.494 \, \text{Å} \), is significantly smaller than the interatomic distance \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \). However, none of the provided options (A: \( 9.08 \, \text{Å} \), B: \( 8.95 \, \text{Å} \), C: \( 9.54 \, \text{Å} \), D: \( 10.05 \, \text{Å} \)) match this calculated value. The discrepancy suggests either an issue with the problem setup or the interpretation of the interatomic distance. Despite extensive recalculations and checks, the derived result remains consistent, and no match with the options is found.

ANSWER: None of the options match the calculated value.
