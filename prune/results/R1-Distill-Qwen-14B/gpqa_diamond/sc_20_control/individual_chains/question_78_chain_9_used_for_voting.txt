Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on electromagnetism, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

The question gives a point charge q moving along a trajectory s(t). At some time tr in the past, the charge was at a certain position, and the vector from that position to the observation point r is d. The velocity at that time tr is v. We're to find the scalar potential V and vector potential A at a later time t, where t>tr.

I remember that the potentials are solutions to Maxwell's equations in the presence of charges and currents. For a point charge, the potentials should depend on the charge's position and velocity.

Wait, scalar potential V is usually due to the charge distribution, while vector potential A is due to the current. But when the charge is moving, it creates both a charge density and a current density.

The scalar potential for a static charge is straightforward: V = q/(4πε₀ r). But when the charge is moving, does this change? I think the scalar potential still depends on the charge's position, but maybe it's corrected by terms involving the velocity or retarded time.

Wait, the retarded time concept comes into play because the electromagnetic effects travel at the speed of light. So the electric and magnetic fields at a point are due to the charge's position and velocity some time ago, specifically at tr = t - r/c, where r is the distance between the charge and the observation point.

But the question mentions vector d from where the field was generated to r. So d would be the vector from the charge's position at tr to r. So the distance is |d|, which is r' in that scenario.

Wait, let me clarify. The vector d is from the field generating point (charge's position at tr) to r. So |d| would be the distance between them, which is the same as the r in the denominator for the potentials. Hmm, maybe not exactly, because when the charge is moving, the position at tr is different, but the distance would be d.

So, for the scalar potential V, I think it's given by the same formula as the static case, but evaluated at the retarded position. So V would be (q)/(4πε₀ |d|). But wait, the options have V as q/(4πε₀ r), which would be the static case if r is the distance from the origin to r. But wait, in reality, d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to the observation point. So if the charge is at s(tr) at time tr, then d would be r - s(tr). So |d| is the distance between the charge and the observation point at that time.

So the scalar potential V should involve 1/|d|, but looking at the options, options A and B have V as q/(4πε₀ r), which would be the static case if r is the distance from the origin. But if the charge is moving, the distance d might not be the same as r. Wait, but in the options, the given V is in terms of r, not d. Hmm, perhaps the problem is assuming that the distance d is equal to r, which might not be the case. Or maybe in the context of the question, they define d as the vector from the charge's position to r, so |d| is the distance. But the options list V as per 1/r, which might not be correct if d is not equal to r.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the retarded potentials. The scalar potential due to a moving charge can be expressed as V = (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/|d| - (v · d)/(c² |d|) ] or something like that. Or perhaps I'm mixing it up with the vector potential.

Wait, no, the scalar potential for a moving charge is given by the same expression as the static case because it's not affected by the motion in the same way. Wait, is that right? Or does it involve some correction for the velocity?

Wait, no, the scalar potential is given by V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * 1/|r - r'(t_r)|, where r' is the position of the charge at the retarded time t_r = t - |r - r'|/c. But in the options, they have V as q/(4πε₀ r), which would be the case when the charge is at the origin. But if the charge is moving, r' isn't necessarily the origin. So I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the scalar potential is the same as the static case but evaluated at the retarded time. But in that case, the distance isn't r, but |d|. So looking at the options, option C and D have V with a denominator involving (d c - d·v) in the denominator. Wait, that looks like the expression for the Liénard term or something involving the current.

Wait, the potentials can be derived from the retarded integrals. The scalar potential is:

V(r, t) = (1/(4πε₀)) ∫ (ρ(t_r) ) / |r - r'| dτ,

where ρ is the charge density. For a point charge, ρ is just q δ^3(r' - s(t_r)).

So V(r, t) becomes (q/(4πε₀)) * 1/|r - s(t_r)|.

But in the question, they define d as the vector from s(tr) to r, so |d| is |r - s(tr)|. So V is q/(4πε₀ |d|).

But looking at the options, the options don't have |d| in the denominator; they have r. So maybe the question assumes that d is equal to r. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait the options are written as V(r, t) = q/(4πε₀ r), which would be the static case. But if the charge is moving, the distance isn't r but |d|. So perhaps the correct expressions involve |d| in the denominator.

Looking at the options, option C and D have terms in the denominator with (d c - d·v) or (d c + d·v). That makes me think about the Lorentz contraction or terms arising from special relativity.

Wait, I recall that when you have a moving charge, the scalar potential can be written in terms of the velocity. Alternatively, the potentials can be expressed in terms of the charge's position and velocity.

Wait, the vector potential A is given by (μ₀ q v)/(4π c²) * something. Because for a steady current, A is proportional to the current, which is charge velocity times charge density.

Wait, I think the vector potential A can be written as (μ₀/(4π)) (q/(c²)) (v × something). But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector potential is given by A = (μ₀ q v)/(4π c²) * [1/(something)].

Wait, I think the correct expressions are:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) [ (1/|d|) - (v · d)/(c² |d|) ]

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q/(4π c²)) [ (v × d) / |d|² ]

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the potentials are:

V = (q/(4πε₀)) [ 1/(d c - (d · v)) ) ] ?

Wait, no, that doesn't look right. Let me think about the Lorentz gauge or Coulomb gauge expressions.

Wait, another approach: the potentials can be found using the retarded potentials formulation.

The scalar potential V is (1/(4πε₀)) ∫ (ρ r') dt', where ρ is the charge density and r' is the vector from the charge to the field point at time t'.

Wait, no, I think the scalar potential is given by:

V(r, t) = (1/(4πε₀)) ∫ (ρ(t_r) ) / |r - r'(t_r)| dt_r,

but for a point charge, this simplifies to (q/(4πε₀)) / |d|, since ρ is a delta function.

But in the options, V is given as q/(4πε₀ r). That would only be correct if d = r, which may not be the case. So perhaps the options are considering a non-relativistic case or assuming that d = r.

Wait, but the problem states that d is the vector from the field generating point (at tr) to r.

So |d| is the distance between the charge's position at tr and the observation point. So if the charge was at position s(tr), then d = r - s(tr). So the distance is |d|.

So the correct V should be q/(4πε₀ |d|), but looking at the options, none of them have |d| as the denominator in V. Option C and D have denominators with (d c - d·v) and (d c + d·v), respectively.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the expressions. Let me think about the exact forms.

Another thought: when the charge is moving, the fields are affected by both the charge's position and its velocity. The scalar potential is similar to the static case, but the vector potential arises from the current.

Wait, the exact expressions for the potentials due to a moving charge are:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) [1/|d| - (v · d)/(c² |d|) ]

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q/(4π c²)) (v × d) / |d|²

Wait, is that correct? Alternatively, I've seen the vector potential expressed as (μ₀ q v)/(4π c²) [ (d × something) ].

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for scalar and vector potentials in the case of a point charge in motion.

In J.D. Jackson's Classical Electrodynamics, the scalar potential (eq. 6.22) is:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) [ 1/|r - r'(t_r)| ]

And the vector potential (eq. 6.23) is:

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q/(4π c²)) (v × (r - r'(t_r)) ) / |r - r'(t_r)|²

But wait, that's without considering any terms. But this is in the Coulomb gauge, perhaps.

Wait, in the problem, vector d is (r - r'(tr)), so |d| = |r - r'(tr)|.

So, V = (q/(4πε₀ |d| )).

A would be (μ₀ q/(4π c²)) (v × d) / |d|².

But looking at the options, none have this expression. So perhaps the options are considering a more simplified scenario, like non-relativistic speeds, where the terms involving velocity are neglected, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, looking at the options, option B says A = (v/(c²)) V.

So substituting V as q/(4πε₀ r), that would give A as (v/(c²)) * q/(4πε₀ r) = (μ₀ q v)/(4π (1/(ε₀ c²)) r) ?

Wait, since 1/(ε₀ c²) = μ₀, because c² = 1/(ε₀ μ₀), so 1/(ε₀ c²) = μ₀/(ε₀ μ₀ ε₀ c²))? Wait, let me compute μ₀ ε₀ c².

Wait, since c² = 1/(μ₀ ε₀), so μ₀ ε₀ c² = 1.

Wait, yes:

μ₀ ε₀ c² = (μ₀ ε₀) (1/(μ₀ ε₀)) ) = 1.

So 1/(ε₀ c²) = μ₀.

So, option B's A would be (v/(c²)) * (q/(4π ε₀ r)) ) = (v μ₀ q )/(4π r).

So comparing that with the expression I have for A, which is (μ₀ q v )/(4π c² |d|² ) * (d × ...), wait, no. Wait, perhaps I was wrong earlier.

Wait, the correct expression for A is (μ₀ q)/(4π c²) * (v × d) / |d|³ ?

But in option C, A is (μ_0 q c v)/(4π (d c - d·v)).

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the potentials are being considered in the Lorentz gauge. Wait, but that's a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the potentials can be written in terms of the fields. The scalar potential is related to the electric field, and the vector potential to the magnetic field.

E = -∇V - ∂A/∂t.

B = ∇ × A.

But for a moving charge, the fields are given by the Lienard's formulas. The electric field is:

E = (q/(4πε₀)) [ (γ (1 + β·d̂)/r² ) e_r - (γ² (β × d̂) × d̂ )/(c² r²) ) ]

Wait, maybe that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the potentials are given by:

V(r,t) = (q/(4πε₀)) [1/(r) - (v·r)/(c² r)] 

But that's in the static case, I think.

Wait, maybe I should think about the superposition of potentials. The scalar potential comes from the charge's position, and the vector potential from the current.

Wait, the current density J is charge velocity times charge density. So J = q v δ³(r' - s(tr)).

So the vector potential would be (μ₀/(4π)) ∫ J(r', t_r) / |r - r'| dt_r.

Wait, but integrating that would give (μ₀ q/(4π c²)) (v × d) / |d|³.

So in that case, A(r, t) = (μ₀ q v )/(4π c²) (d × v)? No, wait, the expression is (v × d) / |d|².

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and need to look at the options.

Option B: V is q/(4π ε₀ r), A is (v/(c²)) V.

So substituting, A would be (v/(c²)) * (q/(4π ε₀ r)) = (μ₀ q v )/(4π r), since 1/(4π ε₀ c²) is μ₀/(4π).

Wait, because μ₀ ε₀ c² =1, so 1/(ε₀ c²) = μ₀.

So, (v/(c²)) * (q/(4π ε₀ r)) = (v μ₀ q )/(4π r).

Is that the correct expression for A?

Wait, in the previous calculation, A is (μ₀ q v )/(4π c²) (d × ...)/ |d|³. But if d is approximately r (if the charge is at the origin), then |d|=r, and if d ≈ r, then perhaps in that case, A would be (μ₀ q v)/(4π c² r) (something). But option B's A is (μ₀ q v)/(4π r), which is larger by a factor of c². So that can't be right.

Wait, because c² is a large number, so if the option B is correct, then the vector potential would be much larger than what we derived. So that suggests that option B is incorrect.

Looking at option C and D, their V and A have denominators involving (dc - d·v) or (dc + d·v). That seems like it's involving some relativistic correction.

Wait, another approach: the potentials can be expressed using the Liénard terms. The scalar potential might involve terms like (1 - (v·d)/(c² d)) in the denominator.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck because I can't remember the exact expressions. Let me try to think about their dimensions.

The scalar potential V has units of volts (V), which is equivalent to (charge)/(ε₀ length).

The vector potential A has units of webers per meter (Wb/m), which is (charge/(mass·length)), since μ₀ has units of H/m (henrys per meter), and 1 H is (kg·m²)/(s²·A²). So μ₀ is (kg·m)/(s²·A²). So (μ₀ q v)/(4π) would have units kg·m/(s²·A²) * C * (m/s) ) / (m) [since denominator is 4π, which is dimensionless]. Wait, C is ampere-seconds, so:

kg·m/(s²·A²) * (A·s) * (m/s) ) / m
= kg·m/(s²·A²) * A s m/s / m
= kg·m/(s²·A²) * (A s m) / (s m)
= kg·m/(s²·A²) * A
= kg·m/(s²·A)
But A is ampere. Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the terms in the options.

Option B has V as q/(4π ε₀ r), which is correct for a static charge. The vector potential A is (v/c²) V, which would be (v/(c²)) * (q/(4π ε₀ r)).

But given that A should have units of Wb/m, let's check:

q/(4π ε₀ r) has units of V.

v/(c²) is (m/s)/(m²/s²) ) = s/m.

So (v/(c²)) * V → (s/m) * V.

But Wb/m is (V·s)/m. Wait, because 1 Wb = 1 V·s.

So (s/m) * V → (V s)/m = Wb/m. So the units match. That makes sense. So the units in option B are correct.

But is this the correct expression for A?

Wait, in the case of a steady current, A is given by (μ₀ I)/(4π) (ln terms or something else), but for a moving charge, it's different.

Wait, another way: in the static case, the vector potential due to a charge at rest is zero because there's no current. So when the charge is moving, it creates a current, hence a vector potential.

Hmm, but if the charge is moving with velocity v, then the current is J = ρ v, where ρ is the charge density. So for a point charge, J is zero except at the point where the charge is, which leads to a delta function.

But the vector potential due to a current is given by (μ₀/(4π)) ∫ (J × r') / |r'|^3 dr', but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector potential can be written as (μ₀ q v)/(4π c²) (d × something). Wait, but I'm getting stuck.

Wait, another approach: the potentials should satisfy Maxwell's equations. So if I compute ∇×A - ∂V/∂t, I should get the electric field.

But I'm not sure if that's helpful without knowing E.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the Lorentz force. The force on a test charge would be given by F = q(E + v × B). The potentials are used to write F = -q ∇V - q (∂A/∂t) + q (v × (∇ × A)).

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the expression for the potentials in terms of the charge's motion.

Wait, let me think about the Lienard potentials. The scalar potential is (q/(4πε₀)) [ 1/|d| - (v · d')/(c² |d|) ], where d' is the derivative of d with respect to time. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the scalar potential is V = (q/(4πε₀)) (1/|d|) [ 1 - (v · d')/(c² |d|) ].

Wait, perhaps not. I'm getting stuck here.

Looking at the options again, option C and D have terms involving (d c - d·v) in the denominator.

Wait, perhaps these are expressions derived from (d c - v·d), which is the denominator in option C: V = (q c)/(4π ε₀ (d c -d·v)).

Wait, if I have V proportional to 1/(d c - d·v) ), then that might be a relativistic correction.

Wait, considering that when the charge is moving, the denominator involves the dot product of d and v.

Hmm, but I'm not exactly recalling the correct form.

Wait, another thought: the scalar potential can be written as:

V = (q/(4π ε₀)) (1/(d - (v (t_r - t)) )) 

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I remember that the exact scalar potential for a moving charge involves terms up to the velocity. So:

V(r, t) = (q/(4π ε₀)) [ 1/|d| - (v · d)/(c² |d|) ]

But then when I look at the options, none have that. So perhaps the correct answer is option C or D, but I'm not certain.

Wait, option C says V = (q c)/(4π ε₀ (d c - d·v)).

If I factor out c from the denominator:

V = (q c)/(4π ε₀ c (d - (d·v)/(c²) )) ) = (q)/(4π ε₀ (d - (d·v)/(c^2 )) )

Which is similar to the expression I thought for V, but not exactly the same.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (d c - d·v) = c d - d·v.

Hmm.

Wait, another approach: consider the case where the charge is moving at velocity v and the observation point is at rest relative to the charge. Then d would be zero, but that's probably not a good test case.

Alternatively, take the non-relativistic limit, where v is much smaller than c.

In that case, terms involving v²/c² can be neglected.

So, for V, in the non-relativistic limit, it would be approximately (q/(4π ε₀)) [ 1/|d| - (v · d)/(c² |d|) ] ≈ (q/(4π ε₀ |d| )) [ 1 - (v · d)/(c² |d|) ]

But if d is the vector from the charge's position to r, and if the charge is moving, then in the non-relativistic limit, the correction term is small.

But the options don't have this form. So perhaps the correct answer isn't in the options, but that's unlikely.

Wait, the options don't have the terms with 1/|d|, but they have 1/r. So perhaps the problem is assuming that the distance is r, which would be the case if the charge is at the origin and d is r.

But if the charge is at the origin, then d = r, so |d| = r. So in that case, V would be q/(4π ε₀ r), which is option A or B.

Then, for the vector potential, A would be (μ₀ q v)/(4π c²) (d × something)/(r²).

But looking at the options, option B says A = (v/(c²)) V.

So substituting V = q/(4π ε₀ r), A = (v/(c²)) * (q/(4π ε₀ r)).

Which simplifies to (μ₀ q v) / (4π r), since 1/(ε₀ c²) = μ₀.

So A would be (μ₀ q v)/(4π r).

But according to the expression I derived for A, it's (μ₀ q v)/(4π c² r) (some cross product term). Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps in the case where d is parallel to v, the cross product would be zero. Wait, but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe in the case where the charge is moving radially outward, then d and v are in the same direction, so the cross product is zero, making A zero. But according to option B, A would be (v/(c²)) V, which would be non-zero in that case, which contradicts the prediction.

So option B can't be correct.

Hmm, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should think about the options.

Option C: V has denominator (d c - d·v). Let me think about units. d has units of meters, velocity v units m/s. So d c has units of (m)(m/s) )= m²/s. Similarly, d·v has units of (m)(m/s) )= m²/s. So the denominator has units of m²/s, which is correct for the denominator in V, which has units of volts multiplied by something. Wait, V has units of volts, which is J/C = (kg·m²/s²)/C. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, the denominator in option C is (d c - d·v) = c d - v·d. So in terms of units, if d is meters, c is m/s, then c d is m²/s, and v·d is (m/s)(m) = m²/s. So the denominator has units of m²/s, which when multiplied by c in the numerator (m/s), gives (m/s) * (m²/s) → m^3/s².

Wait, the numerator is q c, which has units of C·m/s. So V would have units (C·m/s) / (m^3/s²) ) = (C/s² m^2) ) → (C·s²/m²) → which is (A·s·s)/(m²) )= A s²/m². But volts are J/C = (kg·m²/s²)/C. Hmm, not matching. So maybe the units are off. So perhaps option C is incorrect.

Option D: denominator is (d c + d·v). Same units as in C, so same unit analysis applies.

Hmm, perhaps the correct option is C. Because when you have a moving charge, the denominator includes a term that accounts for the motion, which would be (d c - d·v), making the potential depend on the relative motion.

Wait, I think I've read before that the potentials for a moving charge are given by:

V = (q c)/(4π ε₀ (r c - r·v)) 

and 

A = (μ₀ q v)/(4π (r c - r·v)).

Wait, that rings a bell. So in that case, V is q c over (r c - r·v), multiplied by 1/(4π ε₀), and A is μ₀ q v over (r c - r·v), multiplied by 1/(4π).

Which matches option C.

Because option C says:

V = (q c)/(4π ε₀ (d c - d·v)),

A = (μ_0 q c v)/(4π (d c - d·v)).

Wait, but in option C, the denominator is (d c - d·v). So if d is the vector from the charge's position to r, then yes. So option C matches the expressions I just wrote.

So the correct answer would be option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the scalar potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) and vector potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \) for a moving point charge \( q \), we analyze the situation where the charge moves with velocity \( \vec{v} \) at the field-generating instant \( t_r \), and the vector \( \vec{d} \) represents the displacement from the charge's position at \( t_r \) to the observation point \( \vec{r} \). The potentials must account for the relativistic corrections due to the motion of the charge.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Scalar Potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - The scalar potential for a static charge is \( V = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r} \), where \( r \) is the distance from the charge to the observation point.
   - For a moving charge, relativistic effects modify the potential. The denominator includes a correction term involving the velocity \( \vec{v} \) of the charge and the vector \( \vec{d} \). Specifically, the denominator becomes \( dc - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \), where \( d = |\vec{d}| \).
   - This correction arises from the relativistic invariance of Maxwell's equations and the finite speed of light, leading to the expression:
     \[
     V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_0 (dc - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})}.
     \]

2. **Vector Potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - The vector potential is proportional to the charge's velocity \( \vec{v} \) and arises from the current density associated with the moving charge.
   - Using the same relativistic correction in the denominator, the vector potential is given by:
     \[
     \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0 qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (dc - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})}.
     \]

3. **Option Analysis:**
   - **Option A:** Incorrect because it does not include the relativistic correction term involving \( \vec{v} \) in the denominator.
   - **Option B:** Incorrect because the vector potential \( \vec{A} \) is proportional to \( \vec{v}/c^2 \), which does not match the relativistic correction in the denominator.
   - **Option C:** Correct. Both \( V \) and \( \vec{A} \) include the relativistic correction term \( dc - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) in the denominator, consistent with the expected form of the potentials for a moving charge.
   - **Option D:** Incorrect because the denominator in \( V \) and \( \vec{A} \) includes \( dc + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \), which is not consistent with the relativistic correction.

### Conclusion:
The correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in **Option C**, as they incorporate the relativistic correction term \( dc - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) in the denominator, which accounts for the motion of the charge.

Answer: C

Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on electromagnetism, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

The question gives a point charge q moving along a trajectory s(t). At some time tr in the past, the charge was at a certain position, and the vector from that position to the observation point r is d. The velocity at that time tr is v. We're to find the scalar potential V and vector potential A at a later time t, where t>tr.

I remember that the potentials are solutions to Maxwell's equations in the presence of charges and currents. For a point charge, the potentials should depend on the charge's position and velocity.

Wait, scalar potential V is usually due to the charge distribution, while vector potential A is due to the current. But when the charge is moving, it creates both a charge density and a current density.

The scalar potential for a static charge is straightforward: V = q/(4πε₀ r). But when the charge is moving, does this change? I think the scalar potential still depends on the charge's position, but maybe it's corrected by terms involving the velocity or retarded time.

Wait, the retarded time concept comes into play because the electromagnetic effects travel at the speed of light. So the electric and magnetic fields at a point are due to the charge's position and velocity some time ago, specifically at tr = t - r/c, where r is the distance between the charge and the observation point.

But the question mentions vector d from where the field was generated to r. So d would be the vector from the charge's position at tr to r. So the distance is |d|, which is r' in that scenario.

Wait, let me clarify. The vector d is from the field generating point (charge's position at tr) to r. So |d| would be the distance between them, which is the same as the r in the denominator for the potentials. Hmm, maybe not exactly, because when the charge is moving, the position at tr is different, but the distance would be d.

So, for the scalar potential V, I think it's given by the same formula as the static case, but evaluated at the retarded position. So V would be (q)/(4πε₀ |d|). But wait, the options have V as q/(4πε₀ r), which would be the static case if r is the distance from the origin to r. But wait, in reality, d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to the observation point. So if the charge is at s(tr) at time tr, then d would be r - s(tr). So |d| is the distance between the charge and the observation point at that time.

So the scalar potential V should involve 1/|d|, but looking at the options, options A and B have V as q/(4πε₀ r), which would be the static case if r is the distance from the origin. But if the charge is moving, the distance d might not be the same as r. Wait, but in the options, the given V is in terms of r, not d. Hmm, perhaps the problem is assuming that the distance d is equal to r, which might not be the case. Or maybe in the context of the question, they define d as the vector from the charge's position to r, so |d| is the distance. But the options list V as per 1/r, which might not be correct if d is not equal to r.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the retarded potentials. The scalar potential due to a moving charge can be expressed as V = (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/|d| - (v · d)/(c² |d|) ] or something like that. Or perhaps I'm mixing it up with the vector potential.

Wait, no, the scalar potential for a moving charge is given by the same expression as the static case because it's not affected by the motion in the same way. Wait, is that right? Or does it involve some correction for the velocity?

Wait, no, the scalar potential is given by V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * 1/|r - r'(t_r)|, where r' is the position of the charge at the retarded time t_r = t - |r - r'|/c. But in the options, they have V as q/(4πε₀ r), which would be the case when the charge is at the origin. But if the charge is moving, r' isn't necessarily the origin. So I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the scalar potential is the same as the static case but evaluated at the retarded time. But in that case, the distance isn't r, but |d|. So looking at the options, option C and D have V with a denominator involving (d c - d·v) in the denominator. Wait, that looks like the expression for the Liénard term or something involving the current.

Wait, the potentials can be derived from the retarded integrals. The scalar potential is:

V(r, t) = (1/(4πε₀)) ∫ (ρ(t_r) ) / |r - r'| dτ,

where ρ is the charge density. For a point charge, ρ is just q δ^3(r' - s(t_r)).

So V(r, t) becomes (q/(4πε₀)) * 1/|r - s(t_r)|.

But in the question, they define d as the vector from s(tr) to r, so |d| is |r - s(tr)|. So V is q/(4πε₀ |d|).

But looking at the options, the options don't have |d| in the denominator; they have r. So maybe the question assumes that d is equal to r. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait the options are written as V(r, t) = q/(4πε₀ r), which would be the static case. But if the charge is moving, the distance isn't r but |d|. So perhaps the correct expressions involve |d| in the denominator.

Looking at the options, option C and D have terms in the denominator with (d c - d·v) or (d c + d·v). That makes me think about the Lorentz contraction or terms arising from special relativity.

Wait, I recall that when you have a moving charge, the scalar potential can be written in terms of the velocity. Alternatively, the potentials can be expressed in terms of the charge's position and velocity.

Wait, the vector potential A is given by (μ₀ q v)/(4π c²) * something. Because for a steady current, A is proportional to the current, which is charge velocity times charge density.

Wait, I think the vector potential A can be written as (μ₀/(4π)) (q/(c²)) (v × something). But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector potential is given by A = (μ₀ q v)/(4π c²) * [1/(something)].

Wait, I think the correct expressions are:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) [ (1/|d|) - (v · d)/(c² |d|) ]

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q/(4π c²)) [ (v × d) / |d|² ]

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the potentials are:

V = (q/(4πε₀)) [ 1/(d c - (d · v)) ) ] ?

Wait, no, that doesn't look right. Let me think about the Lorentz gauge or Coulomb gauge expressions.

Wait, another approach: the potentials can be found using the retarded potentials formulation.

The scalar potential V is (1/(4πε₀)) ∫ (ρ r') dt', where ρ is the charge density and r' is the vector from the charge to the field point at time t'.

Wait, no, I think the scalar potential is given by:

V(r, t) = (1/(4πε₀)) ∫ (ρ(t_r) ) / |r - r'(t_r)| dt_r,

but for a point charge, this simplifies to (q/(4πε₀)) / |d|, since ρ is a delta function.

But in the options, V is given as q/(4πε₀ r). That would only be correct if d = r, which may not be the case. So perhaps the options are considering a non-relativistic case or assuming that d = r.

Wait, but the problem states that d is the vector from the field generating point (at tr) to r.

So |d| is the distance between the charge's position at tr and the observation point. So if the charge was at position s(tr), then d = r - s(tr). So the distance is |d|.

So the correct V should be q/(4πε₀ |d|), but looking at the options, none of them have |d| as the denominator in V. Option C and D have denominators with (d c - d·v) and (d c + d·v), respectively.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the expressions. Let me think about the exact forms.

Another thought: when the charge is moving, the fields are affected by both the charge's position and its velocity. The scalar potential is similar to the static case, but the vector potential arises from the current.

Wait, the exact expressions for the potentials due to a moving charge are:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) [1/|d| - (v · d)/(c² |d|) ]

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q/(4π c²)) (v × d) / |d|²

Wait, is that correct? Alternatively, I've seen the vector potential expressed as (μ₀ q v)/(4π c²) [ (d × something) ].

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for scalar and vector potentials in the case of a point charge in motion.

In J.D. Jackson's Classical Electrodynamics, the scalar potential (eq. 6.22) is:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) [ 1/|r - r'(t_r)| ]

And the vector potential (eq. 6.23) is:

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q/(4π c²)) (v × (r - r'(t_r)) ) / |r - r'(t_r)|²

But wait, that's without considering any terms. But this is in the Coulomb gauge, perhaps.

Wait, in the problem, vector d is (r - r'(tr)), so |d| = |r - r'(tr)|.

So, V = (q/(4πε₀ |d| )).

A would be (μ₀ q/(4π c²)) (v × d) / |d|².

But looking at the options, none have this expression. So perhaps the options are considering a more simplified scenario, like non-relativistic speeds, where the terms involving velocity are neglected, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, looking at the options, option B says A = (v/(c²)) V.

So substituting V as q/(4πε₀ r), that would give A as (v/(c²)) * q/(4πε₀ r) = (μ₀ q v)/(4π (1/(ε₀ c²)) r) ?

Wait, since 1/(ε₀ c²) = μ₀, because c² = 1/(ε₀ μ₀), so 1/(ε₀ c²) = μ₀/(ε₀ μ₀ ε₀ c²))? Wait, let me compute μ₀ ε₀ c².

Wait, since c² = 1/(μ₀ ε₀), so μ₀ ε₀ c² = 1.

Wait, yes:

μ₀ ε₀ c² = (μ₀ ε₀) (1/(μ₀ ε₀)) ) = 1.

So 1/(ε₀ c²) = μ₀.

So, option B's A would be (v/(c²)) * (q/(4π ε₀ r)) ) = (v μ₀ q )/(4π r).

So comparing that with the expression I have for A, which is (μ₀ q v )/(4π c² |d|² ) * (d × ...), wait, no. Wait, perhaps I was wrong earlier.

Wait, the correct expression for A is (μ₀ q)/(4π c²) * (v × d) / |d|³ ?

But in option C, A is (μ_0 q c v)/(4π (d c - d·v)).

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the potentials are being considered in the Lorentz gauge. Wait, but that's a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the potentials can be written in terms of the fields. The scalar potential is related to the electric field, and the vector potential to the magnetic field.

E = -∇V - ∂A/∂t.

B = ∇ × A.

But for a moving charge, the fields are given by the Lienard's formulas. The electric field is:

E = (q/(4πε₀)) [ (γ (1 + β·d̂)/r² ) e_r - (γ² (β × d̂) × d̂ )/(c² r²) ) ]

Wait, maybe that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the potentials are given by:

V(r,t) = (q/(4πε₀)) [1/(r) - (v·r)/(c² r)] 

But that's in the static case, I think.

Wait, maybe I should think about the superposition of potentials. The scalar potential comes from the charge's position, and the vector potential from the current.

Wait, the current density J is charge velocity times charge density. So J = q v δ³(r' - s(tr)).

So the vector potential would be (μ₀/(4π)) ∫ J(r', t_r) / |r - r'| dt_r.

Wait, but integrating that would give (μ₀ q/(4π c²)) (v × d) / |d|³.

So in that case, A(r, t) = (μ₀ q v )/(4π c²) (d × v)? No, wait, the expression is (v × d) / |d|².

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and need to look at the options.

Option B: V is q/(4π ε₀ r), A is (v/(c²)) V.

So substituting, A would be (v/(c²)) * (q/(4π ε₀ r)) = (μ₀ q v )/(4π r), since 1/(4π ε₀ c²) is μ₀/(4π).

Wait, because μ₀ ε₀ c² =1, so 1/(ε₀ c²) = μ₀.

So, (v/(c²)) * (q/(4π ε₀ r)) = (v μ₀ q )/(4π r).

Is that the correct expression for A?

Wait, in the previous calculation, A is (μ₀ q v )/(4π c²) (d × ...)/ |d|³. But if d is approximately r (if the charge is at the origin), then |d|=r, and if d ≈ r, then perhaps in that case, A would be (μ₀ q v)/(4π c² r) (something). But option B's A is (μ₀ q v)/(4π r), which is larger by a factor of c². So that can't be right.

Wait, because c² is a large number, so if the option B is correct, then the vector potential would be much larger than what we derived. So that suggests that option B is incorrect.

Looking at option C and D, their V and A have denominators involving (dc - d·v) or (dc + d·v). That seems like it's involving some relativistic correction.

Wait, another approach: the potentials can be expressed using the Liénard terms. The scalar potential might involve terms like (1 - (v·d)/(c² d)) in the denominator.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck because I can't remember the exact expressions. Let me try to think about their dimensions.

The scalar potential V has units of volts (V), which is equivalent to (charge)/(ε₀ length).

The vector potential A has units of webers per meter (Wb/m), which is (charge/(mass·length)), since μ₀ has units of H/m (henrys per meter), and 1 H is (kg·m²)/(s²·A²). So μ₀ is (kg·m)/(s²·A²). So (μ₀ q v)/(4π) would have units kg·m/(s²·A²) * C * (m/s) ) / (m) [since denominator is 4π, which is dimensionless]. Wait, C is ampere-seconds, so:

kg·m/(s²·A²) * (A·s) * (m/s) ) / m
= kg·m/(s²·A²) * A s m/s / m
= kg·m/(s²·A²) * (A s m) / (s m)
= kg·m/(s²·A²) * A
= kg·m/(s²·A)
But A is ampere. Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the terms in the options.

Option B has V as q/(4π ε₀ r), which is correct for a static charge. The vector potential A is (v/c²) V, which would be (v/(c²)) * (q/(4π ε₀ r)).

But given that A should have units of Wb/m, let's check:

q/(4π ε₀ r) has units of V.

v/(c²) is (m/s)/(m²/s²) ) = s/m.

So (v/(c²)) * V → (s/m) * V.

But Wb/m is (V·s)/m. Wait, because 1 Wb = 1 V·s.

So (s/m) * V → (V s)/m = Wb/m. So the units match. That makes sense. So the units in option B are correct.

But is this the correct expression for A?

Wait, in the case of a steady current, A is given by (μ₀ I)/(4π) (ln terms or something else), but for a moving charge, it's different.

Wait, another way: in the static case, the vector potential due to a charge at rest is zero because there's no current. So when the charge is moving, it creates a current, hence a vector potential.

Hmm, but if the charge is moving with velocity v, then the current is J = ρ v, where ρ is the charge density. So for a point charge, J is zero except at the point where the charge is, which leads to a delta function.

But the vector potential due to a current is given by (μ₀/(4π)) ∫ (J × r') / |r'|^3 dr', but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector potential can be written as (μ₀ q v)/(4π c²) (d × something). Wait, but I'm getting stuck.

Wait, another approach: the potentials should satisfy Maxwell's equations. So if I compute ∇×A - ∂V/∂t, I should get the electric field.

But I'm not sure if that's helpful without knowing E.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the Lorentz force. The force on a test charge would be given by F = q(E + v × B). The potentials are used to write F = -q ∇V - q (∂A/∂t) + q (v × (∇ × A)).

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the expression for the potentials in terms of the charge's motion.

Wait, let me think about the Lienard potentials. The scalar potential is (q/(4πε₀)) [ 1/|d| - (v · d')/(c² |d|) ], where d' is the derivative of d with respect to time. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the scalar potential is V = (q/(4πε₀)) (1/|d|) [ 1 - (v · d')/(c² |d|) ].

Wait, perhaps not. I'm getting stuck here.

Looking at the options again, option C and D have terms involving (d c - d·v) in the denominator.

Wait, perhaps these are expressions derived from (d c - v·d), which is the denominator in option C: V = (q c)/(4π ε₀ (d c -d·v)).

Wait, if I have V proportional to 1/(d c - d·v) ), then that might be a relativistic correction.

Wait, considering that when the charge is moving, the denominator involves the dot product of d and v.

Hmm, but I'm not exactly recalling the correct form.

Wait, another thought: the scalar potential can be written as:

V = (q/(4π ε₀)) (1/(d - (v (t_r - t)) )) 

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I remember that the exact scalar potential for a moving charge involves terms up to the velocity. So:

V(r, t) = (q/(4π ε₀)) [ 1/|d| - (v · d)/(c² |d|) ]

But then when I look at the options, none have that. So perhaps the correct answer is option C or D, but I'm not certain.

Wait, option C says V = (q c)/(4π ε₀ (d c - d·v)).

If I factor out c from the denominator:

V = (q c)/(4π ε₀ c (d - (d·v)/(c²) )) ) = (q)/(4π ε₀ (d - (d·v)/(c^2 )) )

Which is similar to the expression I thought for V, but not exactly the same.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (d c - d·v) = c d - d·v.

Hmm.

Wait, another approach: consider the case where the charge is moving at velocity v and the observation point is at rest relative to the charge. Then d would be zero, but that's probably not a good test case.

Alternatively, take the non-relativistic limit, where v is much smaller than c.

In that case, terms involving v²/c² can be neglected.

So, for V, in the non-relativistic limit, it would be approximately (q/(4π ε₀)) [ 1/|d| - (v · d)/(c² |d|) ] ≈ (q/(4π ε₀ |d| )) [ 1 - (v · d)/(c² |d|) ]

But if d is the vector from the charge's position to r, and if the charge is moving, then in the non-relativistic limit, the correction term is small.

But the options don't have this form. So perhaps the correct answer isn't in the options, but that's unlikely.

Wait, the options don't have the terms with 1/|d|, but they have 1/r. So perhaps the problem is assuming that the distance is r, which would be the case if the charge is at the origin and d is r.

But if the charge is at the origin, then d = r, so |d| = r. So in that case, V would be q/(4π ε₀ r), which is option A or B.

Then, for the vector potential, A would be (μ₀ q v)/(4π c²) (d × something)/(r²).

But looking at the options, option B says A = (v/(c²)) V.

So substituting V = q/(4π ε₀ r), A = (v/(c²)) * (q/(4π ε₀ r)).

Which simplifies to (μ₀ q v) / (4π r), since 1/(ε₀ c²) = μ₀.

So A would be (μ₀ q v)/(4π r).

But according to the expression I derived for A, it's (μ₀ q v)/(4π c² r) (some cross product term). Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps in the case where d is parallel to v, the cross product would be zero. Wait, but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe in the case where the charge is moving radially outward, then d and v are in the same direction, so the cross product is zero, making A zero. But according to option B, A would be (v/(c²)) V, which would be non-zero in that case, which contradicts the prediction.

So option B can't be correct.

Hmm, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should think about the options.

Option C: V has denominator (d c - d·v). Let me think about units. d has units of meters, velocity v units m/s. So d c has units of (m)(m/s) )= m²/s. Similarly, d·v has units of (m)(m/s) )= m²/s. So the denominator has units of m²/s, which is correct for the denominator in V, which has units of volts multiplied by something. Wait, V has units of volts, which is J/C = (kg·m²/s²)/C. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, the denominator in option C is (d c - d·v) = c d - v·d. So in terms of units, if d is meters, c is m/s, then c d is m²/s, and v·d is (m/s)(m) = m²/s. So the denominator has units of m²/s, which when multiplied by c in the numerator (m/s), gives (m/s) * (m²/s) → m^3/s².

Wait, the numerator is q c, which has units of C·m/s. So V would have units (C·m/s) / (m^3/s²) ) = (C/s² m^2) ) → (C·s²/m²) → which is (A·s·s)/(m²) )= A s²/m². But volts are J/C = (kg·m²/s²)/C. Hmm, not matching. So maybe the units are off. So perhaps option C is incorrect.

Option D: denominator is (d c + d·v). Same units as in C, so same unit analysis applies.

Hmm, perhaps the correct option is C. Because when you have a moving charge, the denominator includes a term that accounts for the motion, which would be (d c - d·v), making the potential depend on the relative motion.

Wait, I think I've read before that the potentials for a moving charge are given by:

V = (q c)/(4π ε₀ (r c - r·v)) 

and 

A = (μ₀ q v)/(4π (r c - r·v)).

Wait, that rings a bell. So in that case, V is q c over (r c - r·v), multiplied by 1/(4π ε₀), and A is μ₀ q v over (r c - r·v), multiplied by 1/(4π).

Which matches option C.

Because option C says:

V = (q c)/(4π ε₀ (d c - d·v)),

A = (μ_0 q c v)/(4π (d c - d·v)).

Wait, but in option C, the denominator is (d c - d·v). So if d is the vector from the charge's position to r, then yes. So option C matches the expressions I just wrote.

So the correct answer would be option C.


To determine the scalar potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) and vector potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \) for a moving point charge \( q \), we analyze the situation where the charge moves with velocity \( \vec{v} \) at the field-generating instant \( t_r \), and the vector \( \vec{d} \) represents the displacement from the charge's position at \( t_r \) to the observation point \( \vec{r} \). The potentials must account for the relativistic corrections due to the motion of the charge.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Scalar Potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - The scalar potential for a static charge is \( V = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r} \), where \( r \) is the distance from the charge to the observation point.
   - For a moving charge, relativistic effects modify the potential. The denominator includes a correction term involving the velocity \( \vec{v} \) of the charge and the vector \( \vec{d} \). Specifically, the denominator becomes \( dc - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \), where \( d = |\vec{d}| \).
   - This correction arises from the relativistic invariance of Maxwell's equations and the finite speed of light, leading to the expression:
     \[
     V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_0 (dc - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})}.
     \]

2. **Vector Potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - The vector potential is proportional to the charge's velocity \( \vec{v} \) and arises from the current density associated with the moving charge.
   - Using the same relativistic correction in the denominator, the vector potential is given by:
     \[
     \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0 qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (dc - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})}.
     \]

3. **Option Analysis:**
   - **Option A:** Incorrect because it does not include the relativistic correction term involving \( \vec{v} \) in the denominator.
   - **Option B:** Incorrect because the vector potential \( \vec{A} \) is proportional to \( \vec{v}/c^2 \), which does not match the relativistic correction in the denominator.
   - **Option C:** Correct. Both \( V \) and \( \vec{A} \) include the relativistic correction term \( dc - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) in the denominator, consistent with the expected form of the potentials for a moving charge.
   - **Option D:** Incorrect because the denominator in \( V \) and \( \vec{A} \) includes \( dc + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \), which is not consistent with the relativistic correction.

### Conclusion:
The correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in **Option C**, as they incorporate the relativistic correction term \( dc - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) in the denominator, which accounts for the motion of the charge.

Answer: C
