Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. The Hamiltonian given is H = ε σ · n, where σ is the Pauli vector, n is a unit vector, and ε is an energy constant. Hmm, I remember that Pauli matrices are involved in spin systems, so maybe this is related to spin-½ particles.

Wait, the Pauli matrices σx, σy, σz are each 2x2 matrices. The dot product σ · n would be a linear combination of these matrices weighted by the components of n. Since n is a unit vector, the sum of squares of its components is 1. So σ · n would be like n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz.

I think the eigenvalues of a matrix like this can be found because the Pauli matrices have some properties. Oh right, each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1. But when you have a linear combination, how does that affect the eigenvalues?

Wait, I remember that for any unit vector n, the operator σ · n has eigenvalues ±1. Because, for example, σ · n can be expressed as a spin operator in the direction of n. The eigenvalues of the spin operator S·n for a spin-½ particle are ±ħ/2. Oh wait, but in this case, the Hamiltonian is ε times σ · n, right?

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. The Pauli matrices each have eigenvalues ±1, but when you scale them, the eigenvalues scale accordingly. So if H is ε multiplied by σ · n, then the eigenvalues would be ε multiplied by the eigenvalues of σ · n.

Wait, but σ · n is a matrix, right? Let me think about the structure. The Pauli matrices satisfy (σ · n)^2 = I, where I is the 2x2 identity matrix. Because (σ · n)^2 = (n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz)^2. Each σi squared is I, and the cross terms involve σi σj + σj σi. But when you square this sum, you get n_x² I + n_y² I + n_z² I + terms that involve σi σj where i≠j. But since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_y² + n_z² = 1. So (σ · n)^2 = I.

Wait, because σi and σj anticommute for i≠j, so when you square, each cross term like 2n_x n_y σx σy would appear. But σx σy = i σz (or something like that), but when you square, they might not contribute because of the sum. Wait, but when you compute (σ · n)^2, the sum of squares would be I. So (σ · n)^2 = I, so the eigenvalues of σ · n must satisfy λ² = 1, so λ = ±1.

So the eigenvalues of σ · n are 1 and -1. Then, H is ε times that. So the eigenvalues of H would be ε * 1 and ε * (-1), so ±ε.

Looking back at the options, option B is +ε, -ε. Option B is correct. Let me check again. The Hamiltonian is H = ε (σ · n). Each term in σ · n is a Pauli matrix multiplied by a component of n, and the square of the operator gives identity, so the eigenvalues are ±1, multiplied by ε, so ±ε.

The Hamiltonian is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \( \vec{n} \) is a unit vector, \( \varepsilon \) is an energy constant, and \( \vec{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli spin matrices. To determine the eigenvalues of \( H \), we analyze the operator \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), which is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices weighted by the components of \( \vec{n} \). 

For any unit vector \( \vec{n} \), the operator \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) has eigenvalues \( \pm 1 \). This can be shown by noting that \( (\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n})^2 = I \), where \( I \) is the identity matrix. Since the eigenvalues of a matrix must satisfy \( \lambda^2 = 1 \), the eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) are \( +1 \) and \( -1 \).

The Hamiltonian \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) scales these eigenvalues by \( \varepsilon \). Therefore, the eigenvalues of \( H \) are \( \pm \varepsilon \).

Among the given options:
- Option A (\( +1, -1 \)) is incorrect because the eigenvalues are scaled by \( \varepsilon \).
- Option B (\( +\varepsilon, -\varepsilon \)) is correct, as it matches the derived eigenvalues.
- Option C (\( +\varepsilon \hbar/2, -\varepsilon \hbar/2 \)) is incorrect because the eigenvalues do not involve \( \hbar \).
- Option D (\( +\hbar/2, -\hbar/2 \)) is incorrect because it does not include \( \varepsilon \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

Answer: B
