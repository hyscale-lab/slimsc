Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the chemical formula of this unknown compound. Let me go through the given data step by step.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, if it's a broad peak, maybe it's more like an alcohol or phenol. Alternatively, maybe it's an amine, but those are usually in a different region. Hmm, but the problem doesn't mention N, so probably O-H.

Then there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 peak is a strong one, which I think is a carbonyl group (C=O). The 1650 might be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring. Wait, aromatic rings usually have C=C stretching around 1600 cm⁻¹. So maybe the 1650 is a conjugated carbonyl, like in a ketone or maybe an ester? Or perhaps an amide, but again, no N info.

Looking at the 1H NMR, there are peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. Vinyl protons are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound has an alkene group. That makes sense with the 1650 peak possibly being from an aromatic ring or conjugated double bonds.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm, 45 is a common fragment. Let me think: 45 could be from something like (CH3)2O, which is 45 (15+15+15? Wait no, (CH3)2O is C2H6O, which has a molecular weight of 46. Wait, 45. Maybe it's (CH3)CO+? Or perhaps -OCH2CH2O- but that might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe the tropylium ion? No, that's 91. Wait, let's see. 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2CHO, but not sure. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from a ketone group. Let me think about possible fragments. Oh, wait, 45 could be from (CH3)3CO+ which is (45), but wait, (CH3)3CO is 59? No, wait. Maybe it's the tropylium ion, but that's 91. Hmm, maybe the fragment is from an ethyl group or something else.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2. Let's think about their possible structures.

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible functional groups could be an ester, or a ketone and an alcohol, but more likely with two oxygen-containing groups. Maybe an ester and something else.

Option B: C6H10O. Could be a cyclic ketone, like cyclohexanone. But then, what about the NMR? If there are vinyl protons, maybe it's a cyclohexene with a substituent like a ketone, but wait, cyclohexene would have two double bonds? No, a cyclohexene would have one double bond.

Option C: C6H10O2. Possible structures could be something like an ester (RCOOR') or a carboxylic acid and an alkene. Or perhaps a cyclic ester, like a lactone.

Option D: C6H12O. Could be an alcohol with a double bond, maybe something like cyclohexanol with a substituent, but the molecular formula has 12 hydrogens. For a six-carbon molecule, the maximum H is 14 if it's an alkane. So 12 implies it's less than that, maybe with a double bond or a ring.

Looking back at the IR data. The broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ suggests O-H. So the compound has an -OH group. Then the 1700 cm⁻¹ is probably C=O. So we have both O-H and C=O in the molecule. That would suggest a carboxylic acid (but those O-H are usually broader and might not fit; wait, but maybe it's an ester with an alcohol group? Or maybe a ketone and an alcohol.

Wait, but carboxylic acids have O-H stretches around 2500-3000, but they are usually very broad. If the peak is very broad, maybe it's a carboxylic acid. But the problem says a very broad peak at 3000, which could be O-H, but also maybe an alcohol. Hmm.

The 1650 cm⁻¹ peak could be an aromatic ring (C=C stretch) or maybe a conjugated carbonyl, like in an ester. Alternatively, a conjugated double bond elsewhere.

Now, the NMR has vinyl protons. So the molecule has an alkene group. Let's think about possible structures with both a carbonyl and an alkene, along with an O-H group.

Wait, if the compound has both a carbonyl and an O-H, perhaps it's a ketone with an alcohol group, but that would be a diketone? Or maybe it's an ester, which has both an O-CO-O and an alcohol group.

Wait, but an ester group would have a carbonyl (around 1700 cm⁻¹) and an O-H if it's a hemiacetal or something, but usually esters don't have free O-H unless it's a hydroxyl group elsewhere.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a benzaldehyde with an alcohol group, but that's not one of the options. Or perhaps a cyclic ketone with an adjacent alcohol group.

Wait, let's look at the options again.

Option C is C6H10O2. That's 6 carbons, 10 H, 2 O. That could be something like methyl cyclopentene carboxylate? Or perhaps a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond. Alternatively, maybe it's a diester? Hmm.

Alternatively, if the compound is a diol, but that doesn't fit with the IR peaks.

Wait, the mass spectrum fragment at m/z=45. Let's think about the molecular formulas.

If the molecular formula is C6H12O2, the molecular weight would be (6*12)+(12*1)+(2*16)=72+12+32=116.

Wait, but what's the molecular weight of each option:

A) C6H12O2 → 6*12=72 + 12=12 +32=32 → 72+12=84 +32=116.

B) C6H10O → 72 +10 +16=98.

C) C6H10O2 →72 +10 +32=114.

D) C6H12O →72 +12 +16=100.

The mass spectrum's fragment is at m/z=45. So that would be a fragment with a molecular weight of 45.

Looking for a fragment of 45 in these compounds.

If the molecular formula is C6H10O2, which is 114. So a fragment of 45 would imply losing 69 or something. But how?

Alternatively, think about which of these formulas can lose a 45 fragment.

What's the molecular formula of each option:

Option C: C6H10O2. Let's see possible functional groups. Maybe it's an ester, which is RCOOR'. The ester group would contribute O2, which matches the formula.

In an ester, the structure is RCOOR'. The fragment m/z=45 could be from the (CH3)2CO+ ion, which would be 58? No, wait. Maybe the acetyl group (CH3CO+) is 43 (12*2 +1*3 +16= 24+3+16=43). Hmm, not 45.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the fragment is from the loss of something like (CH2)2O, but that would be 46. Not 45.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is from a (CH2CH2O) group? No, that seems unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the molecular ion loses a group, like H2O, but that's 18. So if the molecular weight is 114 (option C), 114-18=96. But the fragment is 45, which is smaller.

Wait, maybe the fragment comes from a cleavage in the molecule. For example, in an ester, the molecule can sometimes break into the acid and the alcohol parts. If the ester is RCOOR', then cleavage could give RCOO+ and R'OH, but I'm not sure if that would give a 45 m/z.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone. Let's think about option D: C6H12O. That's a molecular weight of 100. If the fragment is 45, then maybe it's losing 55, but not sure.

Wait, another approach: 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)3CO, which is (3*CH3 groups) attached to O: (3*15 + 16) = 45 +16? No, wait. (CH3)3CO would be (3*(12+3)) +16 +1 (for the O). Wait, no, (CH3)3CO is (C4H9O), which has a molecular weight of 4*12 +9*1 +16 =48+9+16=73. So that can't be.

Wait, 45 is (CH3)2CHO, which is pentanal? No, no, (CH3)2CHO is (CH3)2CH-O, which would be a ketone? Wait, no. Oh, wait, (CH3)2CHO is (CH3)2CHOH? No, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe the fragment is from an ethyl group. 45 could be the fragment (CH2CH2O), but that doesn't add up. Alternatively, maybe it's a fragment from a benzene ring, but I don't have info about that.

Alternatively, think about the molecular formula. Let's calculate the molecular weight for each option and see how 45 could fit.

Option A: 116. So a fragment of 45 implies the molecule is bigger than 45, which it is. But how would the molecule break into a 45 fragment? Maybe a part of the molecule is 45.

Option C: 114. So the fragment at 45 is possible if a part of the molecule is 45.

Looking for a 45 fragment in molecular formulas. The 45 could be from (CH3)2CO, which is 43 (but that doesn't add up). Wait, (CH2)2CO would be 45: (2*14) +12 +16 =28+12+16=56. No, that's not right.

Wait, 45 is 3*(15) + 0. Oh, wait, 45 is 3*15, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's a (CH3)2CO+ ion that's 43, but that's not 45.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the possible functional groups.

The IR has a carbonyl (1700) and perhaps an aromatic ring (1650). Or maybe the 1650 is a conjugated carbonyl, like in an ester or a ketone with an adjacent double bond.

The presence of vinyl protons in the NMR suggests an alkene, so the molecule has a double bond.

The O-H peak is broad, so the compound has an -OH group.

Putting this together, possible structures could be an allylic alcohol with a ketone or ester group.

Wait, another thought: maybe the compound is a dienol ester? Or perhaps it's a cyclic ester with a double bond.

Alternatively, if the compound is a benzene ring with substituents. But the IR doesn't show a strong aromatic C-H stretch (like around 3000 cm⁻¹ is also a region where aromatic C-H appears, but that might be a different peak). Wait, the FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000, which could be O-H, and perhaps the aromatic C-H would be in the same region but as a less broad peak. But the question says there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. So the 1700 is probably C=O, and 1650 might be C=C. So maybe the molecule has both a carbonyl and a double bond.

Wait, perhaps it's a cyclic ketone with a double bond. For example, cyclopentenone, but that would have a ketone and a double bond, but would it have an O-H?

Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted cyclohexene with a ketone group and an alcohol.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the mass spectrum. The fragment at m/z =45. Let's think about what could produce that. Let's consider possible substructures.

45 could be a CH2CH2O group? No, that's 46. Or maybe the methyl group attached to something else. Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a ketone group. For example, (CH3)2CO+ would be (2*15) + (12 +16) → 30 +28=58. Not 45.

Wait, maybe the fragment is a CH3CO group. That's (12 + 2*1) + (12 +16) → 14 +28 =42. No, not 45.

Hmm, another idea: maybe the fragment is from a cleavage that produces an acetyl group plus something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula has a -CH2CH2-O- group, which could lose a fragment. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the molecular formulas again.

If the formula is C6H10O2, that's 6 carbons, 10 H, 2 O. The degree of unsaturation can be calculated by the formula: Degrees of Unsat = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, so (2*6 +2 -10 -0 +0)/2 = (14-10)/2 = 2. So two degrees of unsaturation. That could mean one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds, or two rings, etc.

If it's a ring and a double bond, maybe a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond elsewhere. But would that give a fragment at 45?

Alternatively, perhaps a di-substituted benzene with a carbonyl group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the presence of an O-H and a carbonyl, so maybe it's a carboxylic acid. But if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be very broad, which fits. But the molecular formula needs to fit a carboxylic acid.

The molecular formula for a carboxylic acid would be CnH2nO2. Let's see: C6H12O2 fits that (n=6: 2n=12). So option A is C6H12O2, and option C is C6H10O2.

Wait, so a carboxylic acid would have a molecular formula of CnH2nO2. So for a six-carbon acid, it's C6H12O2 (option A). But then, what about the other IR peaks?

A carboxylic acid has a broad O-H peak (which matches the 3000 cm⁻¹ peak), and a strong carbonyl peak around 1700 cm⁻¹. The 1650 could be something else, perhaps an aromatic ring, but if it's a carboxylic acid, maybe the compound is benzoic acid, but then the molecular formula would be different. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted carboxylic acid with a double bond.

But wait, the NMR shows vinyl protons, so there's a double bond. A carboxylic acid with a double bond somewhere. But then the degrees of unsaturation would be... Let's calculate for option A: C6H12O2.

Degrees of Unsaturation = (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one degree, which could be a ring or double bond. But the NMR shows vinyl protons, so a double bond. So that would leave the other degree for a ring.

But wait, a carboxylic acid has one double bond (the C=O), which is a degree of unsaturation. So the structure would have another ring or double bond.

Wait, perhaps it's a cyclohexene carboxylic acid. So a six-membered ring with a double bond and a COOH group. That would fit the O-H (carboxylic acid), the carbonyl, and the vinyl protons from the double bond.

But then, the molecular formula would be C6H10O2, because cyclohexene is C6H10. Wait, wait, no. Wait, cyclohexene is C6H10, and adding a COOH group would make it C7H12O2. That doesn't match the options.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused again. Let me recount.

If the compound is a carboxylic acid, formula would be CnH2nO2. For n=6, that's C6H12O2, which is option A.

But if it's a cyclic structure with a double bond, what would that imply? Like a cyclohexene ring with a COOH group.

Wait, cyclohexene has the formula C6H10. Adding a COOH group (which is -COOH, which adds one C, two O, and doesn't add H, because it replaces a H from the ring). Wait, no, wait: the COOH group is -COOH, which is -C(O)OH. So attaching that to cyclohexene would increase the number of carbons by one. So that would be C7H10O2, which is not among the options.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituted cyclohexene with a carbonyl group. But that doesn't seem to fit the O-H data.

Wait, maybe the O-H isn't from a carboxylic acid but from an alcohol. So the IR peaks would be O-H (broad, maybe alcohol) at 3000, and a carbonyl (C=O) at 1700. Then the 1650 could be a conjugated double bond, like in an ester or ketone.

So the molecule has a carbonyl group (C=O), a double bond (vinyl H in NMR), and an O-H (alcohol group).

Looking at the options again:

Option C is C6H10O2. That would have two oxygen atoms.

If the structure has both a carbonyl (like an ester group) and an alcohol, that's two oxygen atoms. So an ester would be RCOOR', which has two oxygen atoms. Alternatively, a ketone and an alcohol would also have two oxygen atoms.

Wait, but for an ester, the formula is RCOOR', which is (n+ m +2) carbons? Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's think about the molecular formula.

If the compound is an ester, the general formula is CnH2nO2. Wait, no: RCOOR' would be (n+ m +2) O. Wait, perhaps I should think of specific examples.

If the ester is something like CH3COOCH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3, which would be C6H12O2. That's option A.

Wait, but that would have 6 carbons in the ester. So the formula would be C6H12O2, which is option A.

But then, where would the double bond come in? Because the NMR shows vinyl protons, indicating a double bond.

Ah, so perhaps the ester is part of a molecule that also has a double bond. So maybe the molecular formula is C6H10O2 (option C), which would fit with a conjugated ester and a double bond.

Wait, let me think. For a six-carbon ester with a double bond, the formula would be C6H10O2. Because each double bond reduces two H's.

So if it's CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3, that's 6 carbons, with a double bond. The formula would be C6H10O2, which is option C.

But wait, let me count:

CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3 → that's 2 (from CH2=CH-) + 3 (from COO-) + 3 (from CH2CH2CH3) → wait, no, perhaps it's better to just count all carbons: CH2=CHCOO is 4 carbons, then the ester R' is another 2 carbons (CH2CH3?), but that would make it 4 + 2 =6? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester with a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a gamma,delta-unsaturated ester.

But regardless, the mass spectrum has a fragment at 45. So for option C (C6H10O2), if the ester is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3, but that would have 6 carbons (CH2=CHCOO- is 4, and the other is 2), but I'm not sure.

Wait, but let's get back to the mass spectrum. The fragment at m/z=45. Let's think about possible ions that have a mass of 45.

If the molecular formula is C6H10O2 (option C), the molecular weight is 6*12 +10*1 +2*16 = 72 +10 +32 = 114.

If the fragment is at 45, that's less than half the molecular weight. So how could the molecule split to form a 45 fragment?

Maybe the molecule breaks at the ester group. For example, in an ester, RCOOR', upon cleavage, could form RCOO+ and R'O-.

The fragment at 45 could be the RCOO+ part. Let's calculate the molecular weight of RCOO:

If RCOO is, say, (CH2)3COO, which is 4 carbons, then the formula would be C4H7O2. The molecular weight is (4*12) +7 +32 = 48+7+32=87. No, that's larger than 45.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is the R' part. For example, if the ester is RCOOR', and R' is CH2CH2CH2CH3 (but that's 4 carbons, molecular weight 58 (12*4 + 8 +16= 48+8+16=72? No, wait: 4 carbons in R' would be 4*12 + 9*1 (from CH2CH2CH2CH3, but that's 10 H's in R'?), not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from a ketene group or something else. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, another approach: the possible molecular formulas and their possible fragments.

For option C: C6H10O2 (114 g/mol). If the fragment is 45, what could give that? Let's think of possible substructures.

45 could be something like (CH3)2CHO (which is 45?), but let's calculate:

(CH3)2CHO is (2*15) + (12 +16 +1) = 30 + 29 = 59? No, that's not 45.

Alternatively, (CH3)CO+ would have a molecular weight of 43. Not 45.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is from the cleavage of the ester group. For example, in an ester RCOOR', upon cleavage, the R' could be a smaller group.

If the ester is RCOOCH2CH3, then the R' is CH2CH3 (molecular weight 46, which is close to 45). Hmm, but that's 46, not 45.

Wait, maybe the fragment is not from the ester but from another part. Let me think about the structure again.

Suppose the structure is something like CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH2CH3. Wait, that's an ester with a four-carbon R group and a three-carbon R'. So the molecular formula would be (4 from RCOO) + (3 from R') → 7 carbons? No, that's not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester, like a five-membered ring (lactone), which would have a double bond. For example, a gamma-lactone with a double bond. The molecular formula for a gamma-lactone (C5H8O2) would be 5 carbons, but our options are for six. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the compound has both a carbonyl and a conjugated double bond, leading to the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak. Like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. That would have a C=O at ~1700 and a conjugated C=C at ~1650.

So, the structure could be something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. That's an ester with a double bond. The formula would be C6H10O2 (since each double bond reduces two H's: CH2=CHCOO- is 4 carbons, and the R' is 2 carbons, so total 6 carbons. H calculation: For CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3, the structure is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. Let's count H:

CH2=CH-: 4 H (each CH2 has 2 H, CH has 1 H)
COO-: no H
CH2CH2CH3: each CH2 has 2 H, CH3 has 3 H → 2+2+3=7 H? Wait, no, perhaps I'm miscounting.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the molecular formula.

CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3 → 6 carbons, the double bond reduces two H's. So the formula would be C6H10O2, which is option C.

So, in this structure, the ester group (COO) would give the 1700 cm⁻¹ peak, and the conjugated double bond (CH2=CH-) would give the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak. The O-H peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is from where? Wait, in this structure, there's no O-H group. So that doesn't fit the IR data.

Ah! So that's a problem. The IR shows an O-H peak, which would imply the presence of an -OH group. So the structure must have both a carbonyl group, a double bond, and an -OH group.

Wait, but earlier I thought the structure might be a carboxylic acid, but that didn't fit the NMR data because the NMR showed vinyl protons, which would fit with the double bond. So, perhaps another approach.

Let's consider that the compound is a hemiacetal or something similar, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a di-substituted benzene with a carbonyl group and an -OH group. But that would require more carbons, perhaps, but our options are all six carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ketone with an adjacent alcohol group. For example, cyclohexanone with a hydroxyl group. But cyclohexanone is C6H10O. If it has an additional OH group, the formula would be C6H10O2 (option C). But then, would that give a strong carbonyl peak and an O-H peak?

Wait, cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group (C=O) and if there's an -OH group nearby, that would explain the O-H peak.

So, a structure like cyclohexanol with a ketone? Wait, no, that would require a geminal diol, which isn't possible. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclohexenone with an adjacent hydroxyl group.

So, let's say it's 3-hydroxy cyclohexenone. The formula would be C6H8O2? Wait, let me count:

Cyclohexenone is C6H8O. Adding an -OH would make it C6H8O2. But none of the options are C6H8O2. The options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2.

So that's not matching any option.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a substituted cyclohexanol with a carbonyl group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the O-H could be from a phenol group. If the molecule is a phenolic compound with a carbonyl group and a double bond. But again, I'm not sure about the formula.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester with an -OH group. Wait, but that's unlikely.

Hmm, perhaps I should try a different approach. Let's look for the molecular formula that can have both a carbonyl and an O-H group, and a double bond, which would match the IR and NMR data.

The presence of O-H, C=O, and a double bond.

Looking at the options:

A) C6H12O2 → Degrees of Unsat: (2*6+2-12-0)/2 = (14-12)/2 =1. So one double bond or ring. But the NMR shows vinyl protons, so a double bond. So that leaves one double bond, and the rest would be a ring.

But wait, a ring plus a double bond would be two degrees of unsaturation, but the calculation says 1. So that's a contradiction. Oh, wait, the formula is C6H12O2. The general formula for a compound with one ring and one double bond would be CnH2n-4O2. Let's check: 2n-4=12? 2n=16 →n=8, but our formula is n=6. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the degrees of unsaturation.

Calculating degrees of unsaturation for option C (C6H10O2):

DoU = (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees. That could be one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds, etc.

So if the structure has a ring and a double bond, that would fit the data. The ring could be cyclohexene (one double bond, one ring: two DoU), but then where's the O-H and C=O?

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclohexene with an ester group. For example, a cyclohexene ring with an ester substituent. That would give a C=O and a double bond (ring), but where's the O-H?

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible fragments again.

If the molecular formula is C6H10O2 (option C), and the mass fragment is 45, perhaps the molecule breaks into a smaller fragment, like C3H7O+.

The molecular weight of C3H7O is (3*12) + (7*1) +16 =36 +7 +16=59. Not 45.

Wait, maybe it's C2H5O+ which is 45. Let's calculate: (2*12) +5 +16=24+5+16=45. Yes! So the fragment would be (CH3CH2O)+, which is 45.

So if the molecule has an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3), then the fragment would be OCH2CH3, which is 45. So the molecular formula would include an ethoxy group.

Looking at the options, option C is C6H10O2. If the compound is an ester, like RCOOCH2CH3, the formula would be (n carbons in R) + 2 (from ethoxy) + 2 oxygens. Let's count:

If R is C4H8O (since RCOO is C5H9O2?), wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let me think: ethyl ester would be RCOOCH2CH3. The molecular formula would be RCOOCH2CH3 → R is C(n)H(2n+1), because RCOO is C(n+1)H(2n+1)O2. So the whole ester would be C(n+1 +2) H(2n+1 +5) O2.

Wait, perhaps another approach. For example, if R is C4H7, then RCOOCH2CH3 would be C5H7O2 * C2H5O? No, I'm not doing this right.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is methyl something. For example, methyl propenoate. But that might not fit with the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an ester with a vinyl group. For example, something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3. The formula would be C6H10O2 (since CH2=CHCOO is C4H6O2, and CH2CH3 is C2H5. Adding them gives C6H11O2? Maybe I'm miscalculating.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is part of the molecule, so the fragment comes from the ethoxy group.

So, if the molecular formula is C6H10O2, and the fragment is C2H5O (45), that would imply that the molecule has an ethoxy group.

Therefore, the structure could be something like CH2CH2COOCH2CH3, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it's a cyclic ester with an ethoxy group.

Wait, another thought: the fragment at 45 could be the tropylium ion, but that's 91. So no.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is the ethyl group (C2H5+) which would have a mass of 29. But that's not 45.

Wait, maybe the fragment is from the loss of (CH2CH2O), which is 46, but that's not 45.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from a ketene group. Wait, a ketene is RC=C=O, but I'm not sure about that.

Wait, maybe the structure is a gamma-lactone with a double bond. Then, upon fragmentation, a small piece breaks off. For example, the lactone ring could open, releasing a smaller fragment.

But I'm not entirely certain.

Putting all this together, perhaps option C is the correct one. It has two oxygen atoms, which would fit the ester or carboxylic acid with an -OH group. The mass fragment of 45 could come from the ethoxy group.

So, the steps are:

IR: O-H (3000 cm⁻¹, broad), C=O (1700), possibly C=C (1650).

NMR: vinyl protons → double bond.

Mass: fragment at 45 → possibly ethoxy group.

So, the formula is C6H10O2, which is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The unknown compound was analyzed using FTIR, $^1$H NMR, and mass spectrometry. The FTIR spectrum shows a broad absorption at 3000 cm$^-$, indicating the presence of an O-H group, likely from an alcohol or carboxylic acid. Two strong peaks at 1700 cm$^-$ and 1650 cm$^-$ suggest the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and possibly a conjugated double bond or aromatic ring. The $^1$H NMR spectrum indicates vinyl protons, confirming the presence of a double bond. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45, which is consistent with a fragment containing an ethoxy group (C$_2$H$_5$O, molecular weight = 45).

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A: C$_6$H$_{12}$O$_2$**  
   This formula corresponds to a compound with one degree of unsaturation. However, the presence of vinyl protons in the NMR spectrum indicates at least one double bond, and the IR spectrum suggests additional unsaturation (e.g., a carbonyl group). This makes C$_6$H$_{12}$O$_2$ unlikely.

2. **Option B: C$_6$H$_{10}$O**  
   This formula has one degree of unsaturation, which could correspond to a double bond or a ring. However, the IR spectrum shows two strong peaks at 1700 cm$^-$ and 1650 cm$^-$, indicating the presence of both a carbonyl group and a double bond or aromatic ring. This requires at least two degrees of unsaturation, making this option inconsistent with the data.

3. **Option C: C$_6$H$_{10}$O$_2$**  
   This formula has two degrees of unsaturation, which can correspond to a double bond and a carbonyl group. The IR spectrum supports this, as it shows peaks for both a carbonyl group (1700 cm$^-$) and a conjugated double bond (1650 cm$^-$). The presence of vinyl protons in the NMR spectrum also aligns with this structure. Additionally, the mass spectrum fragment at m/z = 45 is consistent with the presence of an ethoxy group, which could be part of an ester or a related structure. This option fits all the given data.

4. **Option D: C$_6$H$_{12}$O**  
   This formula has one degree of unsaturation, which is insufficient to account for the two strong IR peaks at 1700 cm$^-$ and 1650 cm$^-$, indicating the presence of both a carbonyl group and a double bond or aromatic ring. This makes this option inconsistent with the data.

### Conclusion:
The compound is most consistent with the molecular formula **C$_6$H$_{10}$O$_2$**, as it accounts for the O-H group, the carbonyl group, the double bond, and the fragment peak at m/z = 45 in the mass spectrum.
