Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. The goal is to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. That's a mouthful, but let's break it down.

First, I need to understand the structure of the target molecule. The benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. Their positions are 1, 2, and 3. Wait, 2-(tert-butyl), 1-ethoxy, 3-nitro. So numbering the benzene ring, the tert-butyl is at position 2, ethoxy at 1, nitro at 3. So the positions relative to each other are adjacent, but they are in a meta arrangement? Hmm, maybe not. Let me visualize it: positions 1, 2, 3 are adjacent in a benzene ring. So the substituents are at adjacent positions.

Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. So position 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6. Position 2 is adjacent to 1 and 3. Position 3 is next to 2 and 4. So the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3—so they are in a row, like 1, 2, 3. So the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. So the substituents are in a 1,2,3 arrangement. That would mean that each substituent is adjacent to the next.

Now, thinking about the synthesis steps. The starting material is benzene. Each substituent needs to be added through electrophilic substitution. The order of addition and the directing effects of each group are crucial.

Electrophilic substitution reactions are influenced by the directing groups already present on the ring. Activating groups are ortho/para directors, and deactivating groups are meta directors. But the order in which these groups are added affects where the next group goes.

Let me list the substituents and their directing effects:

1. tert-butyl: it's a bulky group, but since it's an alkyl group, it's an activating, ortho/para director. However, bulky groups may direct more to para positions due to steric hindrance.

2. Nitro group: a strong deactivating, meta-directing group.

3. Ethoxy group: an activating, ortho/para-directing group.

So the challenge is to add these substituents in an order that allows each new group to be added in the correct position relative to the others.

Wait, but the target has all three groups. Let's think about possible sequences.

First, which group should be added first? Because the nitro group is deactivating, it would make the ring less reactive towards further substitutions. So maybe we should add the nitro group last, or perhaps as one of the first steps, but considering that the other substituents are activating.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added after the other groups, but that might be difficult because as a deactivating group, it would hinder further substitution. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the structure again. The ethoxy group is at position 1, nitro at 3, tert-butyl at 2.

So, perhaps the nitro group is added after the ethoxy and tert-butyl groups. Wait, but the nitro group being deactivating would make the ring less reactive for adding the ethoxy group. Wait, no, maybe the ethoxy group is added first, then others.

Let me outline possible sequences.

Option 1: Add tert-butyl first. Then nitro, then ethoxy.

But wait, after adding tert-butyl, the ring is activated (since it's an alkyl group), so the next substitution would be directed by the tert-butyl group. Let's say we add nitro next. Where would the nitro group go?

When adding nitro to a benzene ring with a tert-butyl group, the nitro would enter ortho or para to the tert-butyl. But in the target, the nitro is at position 3 relative to the ethoxy and tert-butyl. Hmm, maybe this isn't the right approach.

Option 2: Add ethoxy first. Ethoxy is an activating group, so it directs incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions. Then add tert-butyl. The tert-butyl would go ortho or para to the ethoxy. But then adding the nitro would have to be in a position that doesn't conflict.

Wait, the target has ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3.

So, let me imagine the benzene ring: position 1 is ethoxy. Then, the tert-butyl is at position 2 (ortho to ethoxy). Nitro is at position 3 (meta to ethoxy? Or maybe ortho or para to the tert-butyl. Hmm.

Wait, the ethoxy group is at 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. So 1 and 2 are adjacent, 2 and 3 are adjacent. So ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2 (ortho), nitro at 3 (meta to ethoxy? Because ethoxy is at 1, nitro is at 3, which is meta relative to ethoxy. Because from position 1, the meta positions are 4 and 6, so maybe that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is ortho to the tert-butyl. Because the tert-butyl is at 2, so if we have a nitro at 3, that's adjacent (ortho) to tert-butyl.

Wait, but if the tert-butyl is at position 2, then the nitro at position 3 is meta to ethoxy at 1? Because from ethoxy at 1, the positions are 2 (ortho), 4 (para), and 3 and 6 are meta, perhaps? No, wait, in a benzene ring, each position has two ortho, one para, and two meta positions. So, for position 1, the ortho are 2 and 6, para is 4, and meta are 3 and 5.

So if the ethoxy is at 1, the tert-butyl is at 2 (ortho to ethoxy), and the nitro is at 3 (meta to ethoxy and ortho to tert-butyl).

So how do we get that arrangement?

Let me think about the order of substitution.

If we add the ethoxy group first, then the tert-butyl group, then the nitro group, what would happen?

Adding ethoxy (OEt) first: benzene → OEtbenzene.

Then, adding tert-butyl: since ethoxy is an activating, ortho/para director. So the tert-butyl could go ortho or para to ethoxy. But in the target, it's ortho (position 2). So let's say we add tert-butyl in the ortho position to ethoxy.

So now, the ring has ethoxy at 1 and tert-butyl at 2. Now, the next substituent is nitro at position 3. Wait, where would the nitro group go when adding to this di-substituted benzene?

The ring now has two substituents: ethoxy (activating, o/p) and tert-butyl (activating, o/p). At this point, the substituents are at positions 1 and 2, so the remaining positions are 3, 4, 5, 6.

The next electrophile (nitro) will be directed by the existing substituents. Since both substituents are activating, the incoming nitro group (which is a deactivating, meta director) will be directed by the substituents already present. Wait, but the nitro group is deactivating, so when it's added, it would deactivate the ring. So perhaps we should add the nitro group last, but that's tricky because after adding it, further substitution would be difficult.

Wait, maybe it's better to add the nitro group before adding the ethoxy group. Let me think.

Wait, if we add the nitro group first, then the ring is deactivated. Then adding ethoxy and tert-butyl would be difficult because the ring is less reactive. Hmm, that might complicate things.

Alternative approach: Let's consider adding the tert-butyl group first.

Benzene → benzene with tert-butyl (via Friedel-Crafts alkylation; but wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride would require AlCl3 as a catalyst. However, Friedel-Crafts alkylation is not very efficient for tertiary alkyl halides because of carbocation rearrangements. Wait, but if we use a bulky tertiary chloride, maybe it's possible. Alternatively, maybe it's more straightforward to use a better method, but the question gives this as a possible step.

So, first step: Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride and AlCl3. So benzene → tert-butylbenzene.

Now, the next step is to add a nitro group. The tert-butyl group is an activating, o/p director. So when we nitrate, the nitro group will go into o or p positions relative to the tert-butyl group.

But in the target, the nitro is at position 3 relative to ethoxy and tert-butyl. Wait, maybe this approach isn't working.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added after the ethoxy group.

Wait, perhaps the order is ethoxy → nitro → tert-butyl? Let's see.

Wait, let's try another approach. Maybe the nitro group is added after the ethoxy and tert-butyl groups, but that seems unlikely because the ring would be deactivated.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is added first.

Benzene → nitrobenzene via nitration.

Now, nitro is a deactivating, meta director. So the next substituent would go into meta positions relative to nitro.

So if we add ethoxy next, it would go into meta position relative to nitro. So nitro at position 1, ethoxy at position 3. Then, add tert-butyl. But where? The existing substituents are nitro (1) and ethoxy (3). The tert-butyl would be directed by the ethoxy (since ethoxy is activating) to ortho or para positions relative to ethoxy.

But let me think about the ring. Nitro at 1, ethoxy at 3. The next substituent (tert-butyl) would be directed by ethoxy to o/p. So, o would be position 2 or 4, p would be position 6. Alternatively, considering the ring, after nitro at 1 and ethoxy at 3, the tert-butyl could go to position 5 or maybe position 2. But I'm not sure if that would lead to the correct structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added after the ethoxy and tert-butyl. But how?

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is to add ethoxy first, then tert-butyl, then nitro.

So first: benzene → ethoxybenzene (using, say, ethyl chloride with NaOH in an SN2 displacement—no, wait, that's nucleophilic substitution. For ethoxy group substitution, we need to perform an electrophilic substitution. So, perhaps using ethyl nitrite under certain conditions? Wait, no. To introduce an ethoxy group via electrophilic substitution, perhaps we can use a diazonium salt.

Wait, no, another approach: perhaps using a Williamson ether synthesis isn't applicable here because that involves nucleophilic substitution. For benzene, the ethoxy group can be introduced via an electrophilic substitution, perhaps through a two-step process.

Wait, maybe we can use a Friedel-Crafts acylation to introduce an acyloxy group, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group can be introduced via a substitution reaction by first forming a nitration, then using Gattermann–Koch reaction, but that might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use a directing group. Let me think again.

Another approach: the ethoxy group can be introduced via a substitution reaction after activating the ring. Hmm, but benzene itself isn't very reactive, so perhaps we need to introduce a group that can be replaced.

Wait, another method to introduce ethoxy group is via the diazo intermediate. For example, to form a benzene ring with a nitro group, reduce it to an amine, form a diazonium salt, and then perform a Sandmeyer reaction. But I'm not sure if that's helpful here.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced through a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But that generally requires a strongly deactivating group (like nitro) already present to make the ring electron-deficient. So maybe we can't do that until after adding nitro.

This is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to outline a possible synthesis.

Option D:

Looking at the options, perhaps option D is the correct one. Let me read that.

Option D steps:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → this is a reduction step. Hmm, nitrobenzene is treated with Fe and HCl, which would reduce nitro group to amine. So now we have aniline.

iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Aniline is an activating group (since NH2 is strongly activating), so the alkylation would occur. But wait, aniline is deactivating because it's a strong activating group only when the amino is attached. Wait, no, aniline is strongly activating but meta-directing because the lone pair on NH2 can conjugate into the ring, making it rich in electrons. Wait, but in the ring, the amino group is ortho/para directing. So, when we add the tert-butyl group, it would go ortho or para to the amino group.

Wait, but in the target molecule, the substituents are ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. So perhaps this isn't the right approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is to add the ethoxy group first, then the tert-butyl, and then the nitro.

But how to add the ethoxy group via electrophilic substitution? Hmm, perhaps using a chloroethane and a strong base, but that's nucleophilic substitution, which doesn't apply to benzene.

Wait, another method: perhaps the ethoxy group can be introduced via a benzene ring with a leaving group, but that's typically done via a nitration, then reduction, then diazotization, then coupling. Alternatively, perhaps using a benzene ring with a nitro group, which can be converted to a good leaving group.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me look at the options again.

Option D steps:

i) Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation → add tert-butyl group.

iv) Nitrate again → add another nitro group? But the target has only one nitro group.

Hmm, maybe not the right path.

Option B:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → add tert-butyl to benzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate the ring. Since tert-butyl is activating and o/p director, the nitro would go o or p to tert-butyl.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro group to amine.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again? Hmm, but target has only one nitro.

So maybe not.

Option A:

i) tert-butyl chloride → add tert-butyl.

ii) HNO3 → nitrate.

iii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation (SO3 is a sulfonating agent, adds a sulfonic acid group).

iv) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

v) dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis perhaps?

vi) H3O+/H2O/Heat → maybe another reaction.

Wait, this seems complicated.

Option C:

i) tert-butyl chloride → add tert-butyl.

ii) SO3 → sulfonate.

iii) HNO3 → nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazo.

vi) HNO3 → nitrate again.

Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the functional groups.

Wait, the target has ethoxy group. To introduce an ethoxy group via electrophilic substitution, perhaps we can use a leaving group substitution. For example, first introduce a nitro group, then reduce it to amine, convert to a diazonium salt, and then perform a coupling reaction with an ethyl group. But how?

Ah, wait! The ethoxy group can be introduced via the Gattermann-Koch reaction, which adds a formyl group, but that's not ethoxy. Alternatively, maybe via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But without a strong deactivating group, that's tough.

Another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction using a good leaving group. So maybe we can first nitrate benzene, then convert the nitro group to a good leaving group, such as a nitro group to a diazonium salt, then perform a displacement with ethanol.

Wait, but wait. Let me think: benzene → nitrobenzene → reduce nitro group to amino (using H2/Pd or Fe/HCl) → then convert to diazonium chloride (using NaNO2 and HCl at low temp) → then perform a diazo coupling with ethanol? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using the Willgerodt reaction to introduce an ethyl group, but that's more for aldehydes.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that typically requires an activating group on the ring. Wait, but if the ring has an activating group, then perhaps another substitution can occur.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. For that, the ring needs to be strongly deactivating (like having nitro groups) and the leaving group must be present. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after activating the ring with a strong activating group. Wait, but that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution using a benzene ring that has a good leaving group. So, for example, benzene is first nitrated, then the nitro group is converted to a nitrate ester, which can leave, allowing substitution with ethoxy.

But I'm not familiar with that exact process. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution after introducing a nitro group and activating the ring, which doesn't make sense because the nitro group deactivates the ring.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck on how to introduce the ethoxy group. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at the options, each of them has a sequence of steps, including nitration, sulfonation, Friedel-Crafts alkylation, diazotization, etc.

Wait, perhaps the key is to add the ethoxy group via a substitution reaction after the ring has been activated, but I can't see how.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an ether formation using a benzene ring with a good leaving group, like a tosyl group. So, for example, first introduce a nitro group, then convert it to a tosyl group (a good leaving group), then perform a substitution with ethanol. But how to convert nitro to tosyl?

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution after forming a benzene ring with a nitro group and another substituent.

Wait, maybe the correct sequence is:

1. Add tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Nitrate the ring, directed by the tert-butyl group, adding nitro in an ortho or para position.

3. Then, introduce ethoxy group via substitution. But how?

Wait, perhaps after nitration, the ring has nitro and tert-butyl. Now, introducing the ethoxy group would be difficult because nitro is deactivating. So maybe it's not the right order.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is: nitro → ethoxy → tert-butyl.

Wait, let's think:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Now, introduce ethoxy group: but how? Nitro is deactivating, so ring is less reactive. Unless we have a leaving group.

Wait, maybe the nitro group is converted into a leaving group. Nitro can be converted into a nitroso group, which can leave, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group can be introduced via a nucleophilic substitution on a benzene ring that's been activated by another substituent, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after the ring has been made more reactive. For example, if we have a benzene ring with a nitro group and a tert-butyl group, which is activating, then perhaps the ethoxy can be introduced via substitution in a position activated by the tert-butyl group.

But I'm not sure.

Another thought: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a benzene ring that has a nitro group in a para position, allowing the ethoxy to be added in an adjacent position.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think step by step for each option.

Looking at the options, each option has a series of steps. Let's go through each.

Option D:

Steps:

i: HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii: Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

iii: tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation: Aniline is a strong activating group, o/p director. So the tert-butyl would add ortho or para to the amino group.

But in the target, the tert-butyl is at 2, ethoxy at 1, nitro at 3. So, if the amino group is at position 1, then the tert-butyl would add at position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para). Let's say position 2.

So now, the ring has amino at 1, tert-butyl at 2.

iv: HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Now, the ring has amino (strong activating, o/p) and tert-butyl (activating, o/p). The amino group is a stronger director, so the nitro group would likely add ortho or para to it.

But the amino group is in position 1. So nitro could go to 2 (ortho—already has tert-butyl) or 4 (para). So maybe it adds at position 3? Wait, no. Wait, the amino group is at position 1; the ortho positions are 2 and 6. The para is 4.

So if the tert-butyl is at 2, the nitro would go to 4 or 6. But in the target, the nitro is at 3. So this might not align.

Hmm, perhaps this option isn't correct.

Option B:

i: tert-butyl chloride → add to benzene → tert-butylbenzene.

ii: HNO3 → nitrate. Since tert-butyl is activating and o/p, nitro adds o or p. Let's say position 3 (para to tert-butyl at 1? Wait, no. If tert-butyl is at position 1, para is 4. Ortho are 2 and 6.

Wait, let's say tert-butyl at position 1. Nitro would then go to 2 (ortho) or 4 (para). Let's say at position 3, but wait, that's meta to tert-butyl. Hmm, no, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the positions wrong. Let me imagine the benzene ring:

Positions are 1 (tert-butyl), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

Nitration would occur at o or p to tert-butyl. So possible positions are 2,4,6.

If nitro is added at position 2, then the ring has tert-butyl at 1 and nitro at 2.

Then, step iii: Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine. So now, positions 1 (tert-butyl), 2 (amine).

iv: HNO3 → nitrate again. Now, the ring has tert-butyl (activating, o/p) and amine (activating, o/p). The nitro would likely go into a position directed by both.

But I'm not sure where that would be. Maybe position 3 or 4.

But the target has the nitro at position 3. So perhaps in this scenario, after adding nitro at 2, reducing to amine at 2, then adding another nitro at 3. But the target only has one nitro group, so this seems unlikely.

So perhaps option B is not correct.

Option C:

i: add tert-butyl → benzene → tert-butylbenzene.

ii: SO3 → sulfonate. Sulfonic acid groups are strong deactivating, meta directors.

So now, the ring has tert-butyl (activating, o/p) and sulfonic acid (deactivating, meta).

iii: HNO3 → nitrate. The nitro group would be directed by the sulfonic acid (since it's a stronger director) to a meta position relative to it.

Wait, but the sulfonic acid is a meta director. So the nitro group would be added meta to the sulfonic acid. Let's say the sulfonic acid is at position 4 (if tert-butyl is at 1), then nitro would go to 1 or 7 (but benzene is six-membered, so 1 is already occupied by tert-butyl. So maybe position 7 is not possible. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the positions wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the sulfonic acid is at position 2, and then the nitro would go to position 5 (meta to 2). But I'm not sure.

This seems complicated, so perhaps this isn't the correct option.

Option A:

i: tert-butyl chloride → add to benzene.

ii: HNO3 → nitrate.

iii: SO3 → sulfonate.

iv: NaNO2/HCl → diazotization of which group?

v: dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis.

vi: H3O+/H2O/Heat → perhaps a nucleophilic substitution.

vii: NaOH/EtBr → this is an SN2 reaction, perhaps ethoxy group substitution.

viii: Fe/HCl → reduction.

ix: HNO3 → nitrate.

This seems a bit too long, but perhaps let's think.

After adding tert-butyl and nitro, you add a sulfonic acid group, then do diazotization. Maybe the nitro group is converted to a diazonium salt, which then undergoes substitution with something.

Alternatively, perhaps the sulfonic acid group is a leaving group, which then is replaced by something else.

But this is getting too vague.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is to first add the tert-butyl group, then ethoxy, then nitro. But how to add ethoxy.

Wait, let's think: to add ethoxy, perhaps we can use a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, which requires a strong deactivating group. So, if the ring already has a nitro group, perhaps we can substitute a leaving group (like a nitro group) with ethoxy.

But I'm not sure about the exact mechanism.

Wait, another way: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction after the ring has a nitro group. Let me think.

First, add tert-butyl group. Then, add ethoxy, but how? Maybe via a substitution after activating the ring.

Wait, maybe it's more straightforward to use a directing group. Let me try to outline a possible sequence.

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

3. Friedel-Crafts alkylation → add tert-butyl to aniline. Aniline is activating, so tert-butyl adds o/p.

But aniline is meta/para director due to strong activation? Wait, no, aniline is ortho/para director. So tert-butyl would add at ortho or para to amino group.

Assuming amino at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2 (ortho), then position 3 is adjacent.

4. Then, introduce ethoxy group. But how? Maybe via a substitution reaction after making the amino group a leaving group. Hmm, but amino groups are not good leaving groups unless converted.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after the amino group is converted to something else.

Wait, another approach: After adding tert-butyl and amino groups, perform a diazotization to convert the amino group into a diazonium salt, which can then be replaced by ethoxy group via a substitution.

So, step-by-step:

1. Benzene → nitrate → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to amino → aniline.

3. Friedel-Crafts alkylation → add tert-butyl (position 2, ortho to amino).

4. Diazotize amino group → form diazonium chloride.

5. Replace diazonium group with ethoxy group via substitution (using ethanol and a catalyst like CuCN or something). So now, ethoxy is at position where amino was (position 1).

6. Now, the ring has ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2, and what's next? We need to add nitro at 3.

But wait, the ring now has ethoxy (activating) and tert-butyl (activating). So adding nitro would be directed to ortho/para of ethoxy, which is at 1. So possible positions are 2 (ortho, already has tert-butyl) and 4 (para). Alternatively, directed by tert-butyl, which is at 2, nitro would want to go to 1 (which has ethoxy) or 3 (ortho to tert-butyl) or 6 (para to tert-butyl). But ethoxy is at 1, so nitro could go to 3 (ortho to tert-butyl) because the tert-butyl is a stronger director than ethoxy? Or vice versa.

Wait, the ethoxy group is activating and o/p director, and the tert-butyl is also activating and o/p. So when adding nitro, the substituents already present would direct the nitro group. But since both are activating, which group is more influential?

I think the group that's more electron-rich (like ethoxy is more activating than tert-butyl?) may dominate. Alternatively, steric factors could play a role. Hmm.

In any case, perhaps nitro would go to position 3, which is ortho to tert-butyl and meta to ethoxy. So that would give the structure we need: ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3.

So the sequence would be nitration → reduction → alkylation → diazotization → substitution with ethoxy → nitration.

But looking at the options, the steps don't seem to match this exactly.

Wait, looking back at option D:

Option D steps:

i) HNO3 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce to aniline.

iii) Friedel-Crafts → add tert-butyl (ortho to amino).

iv) HNO3 → nitrate again. But after adding tert-butyl, the ring has activating groups, so nitration would occur at o/p positions. But the target has only one nitro group, so perhaps this is not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps after adding tert-butyl, nitration is done in a specific position.

Wait, perhaps in option D, after adding tert-butyl, the next nitration adds the nitro group in a position that's meta to the ethoxy group introduced later.

Hmm...

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is to add ethoxy via a substitution after converting a leaving group.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add nitro group.

2. Add ethoxy group via substitution.

3. Add tert-butyl group.

But how to do that.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the correct order is to add the ethoxy group after the nitro group, using a substitution.

So, let me outline:

1. Benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

3. Convert amine to diazonium salt → benzene diazonium chloride.

4. Perform a substitution reaction with ethanol to introduce ethoxy group.

But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is converted into a nitroso group, which can be a leaving group.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution after making the ring strongly deactivating.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction after the ring has a nitro group and a tert-butyl group.

But this is getting too tangled. Maybe I should look for the correct answer by elimination.

Each option has several steps. Let me see which option aligns with the target structure.

The target has three substituents: ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3.

Assuming the starting point is benzene, the first substituent is likely the tert-butyl or the nitro.

Wait, let's think about the sequence: to get the substituents in the correct positions, perhaps the nitro group is added last, because it's deactivating and would be more difficult to add after.

But let's consider the steps in each option.

Option D:

Steps:

i) Nitrate → nitrobenzene.

ii) Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

iii) Friedel-Crafts → add tert-butyl (ortho or para to amine).

iv) Nitrate again → add another nitro? But target has one nitro.

So this seems incorrect.

Option B:

i) tert-butyl → benzene → tert-butylbenzene.

ii) Nitrate. tert-butyl is activating, o/p director. Nitro added o/p.

Let's say at position 2 (ortho to tert-butyl, position 1). So nitro at 2.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine (position 2 → amine).

iv) Nitrate again → add nitro. Now, the ring has tert-butyl (1) and amine (2). Nitration would be directed by amine (activating, o/p). Possible positions: 3 (ortho to amine at 2) and 4 (para to amine at 2). So if nitro is added at 3, that's adjacent to amine (position 2) and tert-butyl (position 1). But in the target, nitro is at 3, ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2. So this can't be because ethoxy isn't added yet.

Hmm, but option B's steps don't include adding ethoxy. So perhaps that's incorrect.

Wait, looking back, the options include steps beyond iv. Let me check option B:

Option B:

i) tert-butyl.

ii) HNO3 → nitrate.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce.

iv) HNO3 → nitrate again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) H3O+ → hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → SN2 substitution.

viii) SO3 → sulfonate.

ix) dilute H2SO4.

Wait, that's a lot of steps. Perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an SN2 substitution (step vii: NaOH and EtBr). So after adding tert-butyl, nitro, reduction, nitrate again, which may not fit.

This is getting really confusing. Perhaps I should think about the order of adding the substituents.

The target has ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3.

So, ethoxy is at 1, which is ortho to tert-butyl (position 2), and meta to nitro (position 3).

So, perhaps the ethoxy group is added first, then tert-butyl, then nitro.

But how to add ethoxy.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction using a benzene ring with a nitro group and a good leaving group. For example:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Convert nitro to a nitroso group, which can act as a leaving group.

3. Perform a substitution with ethanol, adding ethoxy.

But I'm not sure about this process.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution after the ring has been made electron-deficient by multiple nitro groups. But that seems unlikely.

Another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Grignard reagent, but that's not applicable for benzene.

Wait, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that requires an activating group. So perhaps after adding a nitro group, it's not possible.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution after the ring has a tert-butyl group, which is activating.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution after the tert-butyl group is present.

But how? Because substitution reactions (like SN2) require a good leaving group, which benzene doesn't have.

Wait, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution where the ring has a nitro group. Because nitro is a good meta director, but in that case, the ring is deactivating, making substitution difficult.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add tert-butyl group.

2. Add nitro group, which is directed to a position ortho to tert-butyl.

3. Then, add ethoxy group via substitution after converting the nitro group into a good leaving group.

But I'm not sure.

At this point, I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess based on the steps in the options.

The target molecule has ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups in adjacent positions. The ethoxy is at 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3.

Let me imagine the steps:

- Start with benzene.

- Add tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts alkylation (option A, B, C, D have this as step i in some cases).

- Then, nitrate the ring, which would add nitro ortho or para to tert-butyl. Let's say para, position 4.

But in the target, nitro is at position 3. So perhaps that's not the way.

Alternative approach: Maybe add ethoxy first, but how?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a key point. The ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction. So perhaps after the ring has a nitro group, we can substitute it with ethoxy.

Wait, but nitro is a meta director. So perhaps:

1. Add nitro group.

2. Convert nitro into a leaving group (like a diazonium salt).

3. Substitute with ethoxy.

So, steps:

i) Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

iii) Convert to diazonium salt → benzene diazonium chloride.

iv) Perform substitution with ethanol → ethoxybenzene.

So now, the ring has ethoxy group.

Then, add tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts alkylation.

But where? Since ethoxy is o/p director, tert-butyl will add ortho or para to ethoxy.

Assuming ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl could go to 2 (ortho) or 4 (para). But in the target, tert-butyl is at 2.

So now, ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2.

Next, add nitro group. Since ethoxy is o/p director and tert-butyl is o/p, the nitro group will be directed to positions that are o or p to either. Let's say it goes to 3 (ortho to tert-butyl at 2, which is adjacent to ethoxy at 1).

So the nitro group would be at position 3.

Putting it all together:

1. Nitration → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduction → aniline.

3. Diazotization → benzene diazonium chloride.

4. Substitution → ethoxybenzene.

5. Friedel-Crafts alkylation → add tert-butyl at position 2.

6. Nitration → add nitro at position 3.

But looking at the options, I'm not sure which option includes all these steps.

Looking at option D:

i) Nitrate → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce to aniline.

iii) Friedel-Crafts → add tert-butyl.

iv) HNO3 → nitrate again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazo.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → substitution.

viii) dilute H2SO4.

ix) HNO3 → nitrate.

Hmm, perhaps after adding tert-butyl, they nitrate again. But that would add another nitro group, which the target doesn't have.

So perhaps option D isn't the right one.

Looking at option B:

i) tert-butyl.

ii) nitrate → nitro at o/p to tert-butyl.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) nitrate again → but target has only one nitro.

So not matching.

Option C:

i) tert-butyl.

ii) SO3 → sulfonate.

iii) HNO3 → nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce.

v) NaNO2 → diazo.

vi) HNO3 → nitrate again.

Which again adds multiple nitro groups.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option D, but I'm not seeing how.

Wait, another thought: After adding tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro groups, perhaps the order is such that the nitro is added last, but directed by the existing groups.

Looking back, the target's substituents are 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), 3 (nitro). So, if we add ethoxy first, then tert-butyl, then nitro, that might work.

But how to add ethoxy via electrophilic substitution.

Ah, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts acylation and then hydrolysis. Let me think:

1. Friedel-Crafts acylation to add an acetyl group.

2. Reduce the acetyl to a CH2OH group (using H2/Pd or something).

3. Perform a substitution to replace CH2OH with OEt.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after the ring has a nitro group and another substituent.

But I'm getting stuck again.

In the interest of time, I'll have to make a guess based on the options. The correct sequence should involve adding tert-butyl first, then ethoxy, then nitro. But looking at the options, none seem to perfectly fit.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is D.

Let me think about option D's steps again:

i) Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce to aniline.

iii) Friedel-Crafts → add tert-butyl (ortho to amino).

iv) HNO3 → nitrate again. Now, the ring has amino (1), tert-butyl (2), and nitro (3?).

Wait, when you nitrate after adding tert-butyl, the nitro would be directed by the tert-butyl (activating, o/p) and the amino (activating, o/p). But since the amino is more activating, the nitro would go ortho or para to amino.

If amino is at 1, and tert-butyl at 2, then para to amino is 4. So nitro would be at 4 or 2 (but 2 is already occupied by tert-butyl). So nitro would go to 4.

But in the target, nitro is at 3. So this doesn't fit.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps after nitration (step iv), the nitro goes to position 3. But I'm not sure.

Given all this, I think I'm not confident in any option, but perhaps the correct answer is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene, the sequence of reactions must carefully consider the directing effects of substituents and the order of addition. The target molecule has three substituents: a tert-butyl group at position 2, an ethoxy group at position 1, and a nitro group at position 3. These substituents are in a 1,2,3 arrangement, meaning they are adjacent to each other on the benzene ring.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**:
   - Begins with tert-butyl alkylation, followed by nitration, sulfonation, and other steps.
   - The sequence does not clearly align with the desired positions of the substituents. The nitro group and ethoxy group would not be added in the correct positions relative to the tert-butyl group.

2. **Option B**:
   - Starts with tert-butyl alkylation, followed by nitration, reduction, and additional nitration.
   - The nitro group could be directed to ortho or para positions relative to the tert-butyl group, but the ethoxy group is not introduced in a plausible manner. The sequence does not lead to the correct 1,2,3 arrangement of substituents.

3. **Option C**:
   - Begins with tert-butyl alkylation, followed by sulfonation, nitration, reduction, and other steps.
   - The sulfonic acid group introduced in step ii is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group, which complicates the addition of subsequent substituents. The sequence does not clearly lead to the desired structure.

4. **Option D**:
   - Starts with nitration to introduce a nitro group, followed by reduction to aniline, tert-butyl alkylation, and further nitration.
   - After nitration (step iv), the nitro group could be directed to position 3 relative to the tert-butyl group at position 2. However, the sequence does not explicitly account for the introduction of the ethoxy group, which is critical to the target structure.

### Conclusion:
The correct sequence must involve adding the tert-butyl group first, followed by the ethoxy group, and finally the nitro group. However, none of the options fully align with this sequence. Among the given options, **Option D** comes closest, as it involves nitration, reduction, and alkylation steps that could potentially lead to the desired structure, even though the introduction of the ethoxy group is unclear.
