Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about reactions involving mCPBA and the resulting products when analyzed using HPLC. Hmm, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation reactions. 

So, the problem says that a chemist does two reactions. Reaction 1 uses (E)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Reaction 2 uses (Z)-oct-4-ene under the same conditions. Both go to 100% completion. Then the products are combined and run on standard and chiral HPLC columns. I need to figure out how many peaks each chromatogram will show.

Let me break it down. First, I should think about what mCPBA does to alkenes. I recall that mCPBA is used for epoxidation, where it adds an epoxide group across the double bond. So, each alkene (E and Z) will form an epoxide. 

Wait, but the starting alkenes are E and Z isomers. When each reacts with mCPBA, will they form the same or different epoxides? I think that in epoxidation, the stereochemistry of the starting alkene affects the structure of the epoxide. 

In an epoxidation reaction, the oxygen adds across the double bond in a way that depends on the geometry of the starting alkene. For an E-alkene, the substituents on either side are opposite each other, so the epoxide ring forms with a trans configuration. Wait, or is the configuration of the epoxide determined by the starting alkene's geometry?

Wait, actually, epoxidation with mCPBA is a stereospecific reaction. The peracid attacks the double bond in a way that the stereochemistry of the double bond is preserved in the epoxide. So, the (E)-oct-4-ene would form an epoxide where the oxygen bridge has a certain configuration, and the (Z)-oct-4-ene would form a different epoxide. 

Wait, no, maybe not. Let me think again. Oh wait, when mCPBA adds across the double bond, it forms an oxirane (epoxide) where the two new oxygen bonds have a cis stereochemistry relative to each other because the peracid attacks from the same face. So the configuration of the starting double bond will influence the epoxide's structure.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me recall: mCPBA adds across the double bond to form an epoxide. For a trans (E) double bond, the two substituents on either side (like the two CH2CH3 groups) are opposite. So when the epoxide forms, the oxygen adds on the same side of the double bond, leading to a trans configuration in the epoxide? Or wait, maybe it's the opposite. 

Alternatively, maybe the configuration of the starting double bond doesn't directly determine the epoxide's stereochemistry because the reaction can lead to different outcomes. I'm getting stuck here. Let me think of an example. 

Take (E)-but-2-ene. When epoxidized with mCPBA, you'd get an epoxide where the two groups on either end are on opposite sides. Wait, no, wait. For (E) configuration, the higher priority groups are opposite. When you add the epoxide, the oxygen comes in from the same face (as per the mechanism, the peracid approaches the same face), so the two new oxygen bonds are formed on the same face, leading to a trans arrangement in the epoxide? Or will it form a cis arrangement in the epoxide?

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the mechanism. The peracid adds to the double bond in a way that the oxygen attaches to each carbon, and the geometry of the addition depends on the starting alkene's geometry. For a trans-alkene, the substituents are opposite, so the epoxide's substituents will be on the same side or opposite?

Alternatively, maybe the endo transition state theory applies here. The mCPBA adds across the double bond, with the peracid's oxygen approaching the same face, leading to the formation of a trans epoxide regardless of the starting alkene's configuration. Hmm, I'm not so sure.

Wait, perhaps the important thing is whether the epoxide products are chiral. Because if the epoxide is a chiral center, then when you run it on a chiral HPLC column, it will separate the enantiomers, but on a standard (achiral) column, they won't separate. 

So let's consider the structure. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 in the middle, but wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3 maybe? No, wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 groups on either end of the double bond. Wait, no, the structure is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, let's correct that.

Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, no. Wait, octene is eight carbons, so the structure is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, oct-4-ene would be CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3. No, wait, perhaps it's better to write it as CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3, but actually, no. Let's think again: oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, that can't be right. Let me number the carbons. Octene is eight carbons, so:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: CH2
Carbon 4: CH2
Carbon 5: CH2
Carbon 6: CH2
Carbon 7: CH2
Carbon 8: CH3?

Wait, no, wait, oct-4-ene is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. No, wait, no. Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3, but that's not correct. Let me think of the correct structure.

But perhaps the exact structure isn't critical. What matters is whether the epoxide formed is chiral. For an epoxide to be chiral, the two substituents on each carbon of the epoxide must be different. So in the case of (E)-oct-4-ene, after epoxidation, do the substituents on each carbon of the epoxide ring make it chiral?

Wait, oct-4-ene is symmetric. Let me think. If the starting alkene is symmetric, then the epoxide would also be symmetric. Wait, but wait, the starting material is (E) and (Z) isomers. So, (E)-oct-4-ene would have the two substituents on either end of the double bond opposite each other. Let me imagine the structure.

Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 in the middle, but perhaps it's more accurately written as CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3. No, perhaps better to write it as CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3 is incorrect. Wait, no, oct-4-ene would be CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3 where the double bond is between C4 and C5? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck on this, but maybe I can think of it as a four-carbon chain with substituents on either end.

Wait, maybe I should think that regardless of the starting structure, the epoxide will have two new stereocenters. So, each epoxidation will produce a diastereomer or an enantiomer. But wait, for symmetric alkenes, the epoxide might not be chiral because the substituents on each carbon could be the same.

Wait, oct-4-ene is a symmetric molecule. Because the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3, so the two ends of the double bond are identical. Wait, no, wait. Oct-4-ene is actually CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, that can't be right. Let me think again. In oct-4-ene, the double bond is between carbons 4 and 5. So the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, perhaps it's CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 but that doesn't make sense because the double bond would be in the middle.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH2)3-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3. No, this is getting confusing, perhaps I should think of the molecule as a four-carbon chain with substituents on each end.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3, but I'm getting stuck, which isn't helpful. Let me focus on the key point: whether the epoxide formed is chiral or not.

Assuming that when (E)-oct-4-ene reacts with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide. Similarly, (Z)-oct-4-ene forms another epoxide. But given that the starting material is symmetric (as oct-4-ene, perhaps), the epoxide might be the same regardless of E or Z configuration. Or maybe not.

Wait, wait. Let me think of 2-pentene as a simpler case. (E)-2-pentene and (Z)-2-pentene would have different structures. When epoxidized, each would form an epoxide where the substituents on either end are different. Now, in the case of a symmetric molecule, like (E)-2-pentene, if the substituents on either end are the same, the epoxide would not be chiral. But if the substituents are different, then the epoxide would have two possible stereoisomers.

Wait, no. For example, if the epoxide has two identical substituents on each carbon, then it might not be chiral. For a molecule to have a chiral center, each carbon must have four different substituents. So let's say the epoxide forms between two identical groups. Then, each carbon in the epoxide would have the same substituents, making the molecule symmetric and thus not chiral.

In the case of (E)-oct-4-ene, if the substituents on each end of the double bond are the same, then the epoxide would not be chiral. Wait, but oct-4-ene is a symmetric molecule. So when you epoxidize it, each carbon in the epoxide would have the same substituents. So the epoxide would not be chiral. So Reaction 1 would produce a single product that is achiral.

Similarly, Reaction 2 would do the same, but wait, no. Wait, if the starting material is (Z)-oct-4-ene, but the molecule is symmetric, then the product would also be the same as the E isomer's product because the molecule is symmetric. Wait, no. If the molecule is symmetric, (E) and (Z) would actually be the same because flipping the substituents would result in the same structure. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, in a symmetric molecule, E and Z would be identical. For example, 2-pentene is symmetric, so E and Z don't exist as separate isomers.

Wait, wait, no. That's only true if the molecule is symmetric. So for oct-4-ene, which is symmetric, the (E) and (Z) isomers would actually be the same because the molecule can't distinguish between the two configurations due to its symmetry. Wait, but that can't be right because the question differentiates between E and Z. So perhaps the starting material isn't symmetric.

Wait, perhaps I need to correct my earlier assumption. Maybe oct-4-ene isn't symmetric. Let me think again. The structure of oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3. No, that can't be right because that would have the same substituents on each end of the double bond, making the molecule symmetric. So, in reality, (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are actually the same because the molecule is symmetric. But that contradicts the problem statement, which treats them as separate starting materials. So I must be making a mistake in considering the structure.

Wait, perhaps oct-4-ene isn't symmetric. Let me think: oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3. No, that would have each end of the double bond as CH2 groups, making the molecule symmetric. So (E) and (Z) would be identical in that case, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps the starting material isn't symmetric.

Wait, maybe the structure is different. Let me try to imagine it correctly. Oct-4-ene would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, oct-4-ene would have the double bond between carbons 4 and 5, so the structure would be CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should focus on the reaction outcomes without worrying too much about the exact structure.

So, when (E)-oct-4-ene reacts with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide. Similarly for (Z)-oct-4-ene. Each reaction produces an epoxide, but whether those epoxides are chiral depends on the substituents around the epoxide ring.

Assuming that each epoxide is chiral, then each reaction would produce a pair of enantiomers. Wait, but if the reaction is done with excess mCPBA, but in this case, it's one equivalent, so the reaction would go to a single diastereomer. Wait, no, mCPBA is an oxidizing agent that adds the epoxide in a stereospecific way. So when the starting alkene is E or Z, the epoxide's configuration would depend on that.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me approach it differently. The starting materials are (E) and (Z) isomers. Each reacts to form an epoxide, which may be a diastereomer or enantiomer. Then, after aqueous acid treatment, what happens?

Wait, when epoxides are treated with aqueous acid, they undergo ring-opening. The acid would protonate the epoxide oxygen, making it a better leaving group. Then, the ring opens with the attack of a water nucleophile. The attack can occur from either side, leading to possible diastereomers or racemization.

Wait, no, in acid-catalyzed ring-opening of epoxides, the nucleophile (water) attacks the more substituted carbon (if any) because it's more electrophilic. But in the case of a symmetric epoxide, like one formed from a symmetric alkene, both sides are equally substituted, so the attack can happen from either side, leading to a racemic mixture if the epoxide is chiral.

Wait, but if the epoxide is symmetric, then the ring-opening would lead to a single product, because both sides are the same. But if the epoxide is chiral, the ring-opening would produce a mixture. Let's think about each reaction.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → epoxide. Then treated with acid. What's the product?

Assuming the epoxide is symmetric, then the acid treatment would lead to a single product. Because the epoxide is symmetric, the attack from either side would lead to the same product, so no new stereocenters are formed, but perhaps the product is a diol.

Wait, no, wait. The epoxide would have two oxygen atoms connected to adjacent carbons. When the acid attacks, each oxygen becomes a leaving group, and the ring opens. For a symmetric epoxide, the attack would happen on either side leading to the same product.

Wait, so for a symmetric epoxide, the ring-opening would yield a single diol. So in Reaction 1, you get a single diol product, which is achiral because the molecule is symmetric.

But wait, no. If the diol has two stereocenters, and the molecule is symmetric, then it might not be chiral. For example, if the diol is meso, which is achiral despite having stereocenters.

Let me think: for example, consider the epoxide from (E)-but-2-ene. The epoxide would be symmetric, leading to a meso diol upon ring-opening, which is achiral.

So, Reaction 1's product is an achiral diol.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → epoxide. Then treated with acid. If the epoxide is chiral, then the ring-opening would proceed in a way that forms diastereomers or enantiomers. But if the epoxide is symmetric, then again you get a single product.

Wait, but if the starting material is (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is not symmetric, then the epoxide would be chiral. Or wait, maybe (Z)-oct-4-ene is symmetric, making the epoxide symmetric as well, leading to the same product as the E isomer. But that can't be the case because the problem differentiates between the two reactions.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the structure again. Let me try to make a different approach. Let's assume that both (E) and (Z) alkenes give rise to different epoxides, which upon acid treatment yield different diols.

Wait, but if the starting alkenes are E and Z and their epoxides are different, then when treated with aqueous acid, each would form a diol. Now, the question is whether these diols are chiral.

If the diol is chiral, then in a chiral HPLC column, it would give two peaks (enantiomers), but in a standard (achiral) column, they would co-elute as a single peak.

Alternatively, if the diol is meso (achiral), it would elute as a single peak in both columns.

So, let me think: when (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with mCPBA, does it form a chiral epoxide? If yes, then when treated with acid, the diol could be chiral.

But wait, let's think about the diastereomer situation. If the epoxide is chiral, then the ring-opening under acidic conditions may proceed in a way that forms a specific diastereomer. Or, if the epoxide is symmetric, the diol would be meso and thus achiral.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the epoxide structures.

For (E)-oct-4-ene, when epoxidized, the substituents on either side of the epoxide would be on opposite sides, leading to a trans epoxide. But if the molecule is symmetric, the epoxide would not be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide is chiral, leading to a pair of enantiomers. But when treated with acid, would that lead to a racemic mixture?

Wait, but the problem states that each reaction goes to 100% completion. So the epoxidation would form a single product, and then the acid treatment would fully hydrolyze it.

Wait, but in the case of a chiral epoxide, the acid-catalyzed ring-opening would typically form a diol with retention of configuration. But wait, in acidic conditions, the ring-opening tends to proceed with partial racemization because the epoxide oxygen is protonated, making it a good leaving group. The nucleophile (water) can attack from either face, leading to possible diastereomers or retention of configuration.

Wait, but I'm not very confident about this. Let me think of another approach. Suppose that each reaction produces a diol. Let's think about the diol's structure:

If the diol is chiral (i.e., has stereocenters and is not meso), then it would have enantiomers. Since both reactions are done with 100% completion, each reaction would produce a single diastereomer or a racemic mixture.

Wait, but the problem states that each reaction goes to 100% completion, so I think mCPBA would add in a specific way, leading to a single epoxide, which upon acid treatment would produce a specific diol.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol from each reaction is a pair of enantiomers. So, Reaction 1's product is a single enantiomer, and Reaction 2's product is another enantiomer.

Wait, but that can't be right because the starting (E) and (Z) alkenes would lead to different epoxide structures, which upon ring-opening would form different diols, perhaps each of which is a pair of enantiomers or a single compound.

I'm getting a bit stuck, perhaps I should think about the number of possible stereoisomers in the products.

Let me think: each reaction yields a diol. The diol can have two stereocenters. If the diol is a meso compound, it would have two stereocenters but be achiral. If it's a chiral diol, it would have enantiomers.

In Reaction 1: Suppose the diol is meso (achiral), then it would be a single peak in both HPLC columns.

In Reaction 2: Suppose the diol is chiral, then it would have two enantiomers. So, when each reaction is done, you get a certain number of products.

Wait, but the problem states that each reaction goes to 100% completion, so perhaps each reaction forms a single product.

Wait, let me think again. Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → epoxide. Then treated with acid → diol.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → epoxide. Then treated with acid → diol.

If the diols from each reaction are different and each is a pair of enantiomers, then combining them would give four products. But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction yields a single diol, which is a meso compound, so each reaction gives one product. Then combining them gives two products.

Wait, no, because each reaction produces a different diol. So if Reaction 1 gives a meso diol, and Reaction 2 gives another meso diol, but perhaps they are different diols, then the combined product would have two peaks in standard HPLC (since they are different compounds) and the same in chiral HPLC.

But I'm not getting anywhere. Let me think of the possible outcomes.

The options are A, B, C, D. Let's consider the possible number of peaks.

If in both reactions, the diols are achiral (meso), then each reaction gives one product. So when combined, two products. Thus, standard HPLC would show two peaks. Chiral HPLC would also show two peaks because each is achiral and doesn't split into enantiomers.

But none of the options say 2 and 2. Let me look at the options.

Options:
A) 4 and 4
B) 2 and 3
C) 2 and 2
D) 3 and 4

Wait, option C is 2 in both. So that would be the case if each reaction produces one product, and they are different. So standard HPLC would show two peaks.

But if any of the diols are chiral, then in the chiral HPLC, they would split further.

So let's say Reaction 1 gives a meso diol (single peak in both columns). Reaction 2 gives a chiral diol, which would give two peaks in chiral HPLC but one in standard. So combined, standard would have 1+1=2 peaks, and chiral would have 1 (meso) + 2 (chiral) = 3 peaks. But none of the options match that.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If Reaction 1 gives a meso diol (one product), Reaction 2 gives a pair of enantiomers (two products). Then the product mixture would have three products: one meso, and two enantiomers. Then, standard HPLC would show three peaks (since each diol is a different compound), but wait, the meso is a single compound. So standard HPLC would show two peaks: the meso and the pair of enantiomers (which would co-elute as a single peak in standard HPLC, because they're different compounds but maybe in the same retention time? No, wait, each diol is a different compound, so they would have different retention times.

Wait, no, the diols from Reaction 1 and Reaction 2 would be different compounds, so each would have their own peak in standard HPLC. So standard HPLC would have two peaks. The chiral HPLC, which can separate enantiomers, would have the Reaction 2 diol split into two peaks, while the Reaction 1 diol remains as one. So total three peaks in chiral HPLC.

So the standard HPLC would show 2 peaks, and chiral would show 3. Looking at the options, option B says 2 and 3. So the answer would be B.

But wait, the other possibility is that both diols are chiral. So Reaction 1 gives a pair of enantiomers, and Reaction 2 also gives another pair, which could be the same as Reaction 1's or different.

Wait, but the starting materials are E and Z. The products might be enantiomers of each other. So when reaction 1's epoxide is treated with acid, it forms a diol with two enantiomers. Similarly, reaction 2's epoxide upon acid treatment forms another diol, which could be the same as reaction 1's, or another pair.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction leads to a pair of enantiomers, but since each reaction is 100% complete, each produces a single enantiomer. Then, combining the two would give two different pairs.

Wait, but I'm getting too confused. Let me try to outline the possibilities.

Case 1: Both diols are achiral (meso).

- Each reaction gives one product. Combined, two products.
- Standard HPLC: 2 peaks.
- Chiral HPLC: Each is a single peak, so 2 peaks.

But none of the options match 2 and 2, except option C. But I thought earlier that this might not be the case.

Case 2: One diol is achiral, the other is chiral (gives two enantiomers).

- Reaction 1: 1 product (meso)
- Reaction 2: 2 products (enantiomers)
- Combined: 3 products
- Standard HPLC: 3 peaks? No, because the two enantiomers would be considered the same in standard HPLC? Or they are different compounds.

Wait, no. Each diol is a different compound. So Reaction 1's diol is a different compound from Reaction 2's diol. So in standard HPLC, each would give a separate peak, regardless of whether they're chiral or not. So, if Reaction 1 gives one product (meso) and Reaction 2 gives two enantiomers (which are a pair of enantiomers), then standard HPLC would have 2 peaks: one for the meso and one for the pair (which would elute as one peak because they're enantiomers, but since it's a different compound, perhaps it's a single peak in standard HPLC). Wait, no. Let me think: the two enantiomers from Reaction 2 would have the same retention time on standard HPLC, because the column is achiral. So they would co-elute as a single peak. Similarly, the meso from Reaction 1 would be a separate peak. So standard HPLC would show 2 peaks: one for Reaction 1 and one for Reaction 2's pair.

Chiral HPLC can separate enantiomers, so Reaction 2's product would split into two peaks, while Reaction 1's meso remains as one. So total three peaks in chiral HPLC.

Thus, standard HPLC: 2 peaks, chiral HPLC: 3 peaks. Which matches option B.

Another scenario: Both diols are chiral.

- Reaction 1: produces a pair of enantiomers (two peaks in chiral HPLC, one in standard)
- Reaction 2: produces another pair of enantiomers (two peaks in chiral, one in standard)
- So combined, standard HPLC would have two peaks (each reaction's product is a pair that co-elutes)
- Chiral HPLC would have four peaks (two from each reaction's pair)
- This would correspond to option D: 3 and 4? No, because standard would have two peaks and chiral four, but option D says 3 and 4. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, if each reaction produces a pair, but the pairs are different, then standard HPLC would see each pair as a single peak, leading to two peaks. Chiral HPLC would have four peaks (two pairs of two each). So that would be 2 and 4. But the options don't have that.

Hmm, but perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Let's think again.

The problem states that each reaction goes to 100% completion. So, for each reaction, the epoxide is formed 100%, then the acid treatment gives 100% conversion to diol.

So, for each reaction, the diol is a single enantiomer or a single meso compound.

Wait, no. If the epoxide is chiral, upon acid treatment, the diol would either be a racemic mixture (if the epoxide is symmetric) or perhaps a single diastereomer.

Wait, but under acidic conditions, the ring-opening of an epoxide can lead to a mixture. Let me think of a specific example. Suppose the epoxide is chiral and upon treatment with acid, the diol forms with both possible configurations, leading to a racemic mixture.

Wait, but 100% conversion would mean complete reaction. So, perhaps each reaction produces a single diol, which could be a racemic mixture, but in solution, racemic mixtures would lead to two enantiomers. However, in the reaction, since it's 100% complete, each reaction produces a single product. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol from each reaction is a single compound. So, if the diol is a meso compound, then it's a single product. If it's chiral, then perhaps two products are formed, but the reaction is 100% complete, so it's a single enantiomer.

Wait, but that's not possible. If the ring-opening leads to a chiral diol, it would form a racemic mixture unless the reaction is stereospecific and leads to one enantiomer.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is designed such that each reaction produces a diol that is a pair of enantiomers, but the reaction is 100% complete, so you get a 50:50 mixture, which is a racemic mixture. But when you combine the products of both reactions, you'd have a mixture of four compounds: two from Reaction 1 (enantiomers) and two from Reaction 2 (another pair of enantiomers). But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces a single diol, which could be a meso compound or a chiral compound.

Let me try to summarize:

- Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → epoxide → diol upon acid treatment.
- Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → epoxide → diol upon acid treatment.

Assuming that (E) and (Z) alkenes give different diols, which may or may not be chiral.

If both diols are achiral (meso), then each reaction gives one product. Combined, two products. So standard HPLC: 2 peaks. Chiral HPLC: 2 peaks (each is a single peak because they're achiral). But that's option C, which says both show 2 peaks. But earlier I thought the correct answer would be option B.

Alternatively, perhaps one diol is meso and the other is chiral. So Reaction 1 gives one product, Reaction 2 gives two products (a pair of enantiomers). So combined, three products. So standard HPLC would show three peaks, but wait, no. Because the pair of enantiomers would co-elute as a single peak in standard HPLC. So standard HPLC would show two peaks: one for Reaction 1 and one for the pair from Reaction 2. Chiral HPLC would show three peaks: one from Reaction 1, and two from Reaction 2.

Which matches option B: 2 peaks in standard, 3 in chiral.

So the correct answer would be B. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 4 and 4
B) 2 and 3
C) 2 and 2
D) 3 and 4

Yes, option B is the one I arrived at.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the number of peaks observed in the chromatograms, we analyze the reactions and their products:

1. **Reactions and Products**:
   - Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene reacts with mCPBA to form an epoxide. This epoxide is then treated with aqueous acid, leading to a diol.
   - Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene reacts with mCPBA to form a different epoxide. This epoxide is also treated with aqueous acid, resulting in a diol.

2. **Chirality of the Products**:
   - The diol from Reaction 1 is achiral (meso), as the starting material (E)-oct-4-ene leads to a symmetric epoxide, which upon ring-opening produces a diol with two stereocenters but no net chirality.
   - The diol from Reaction 2 is chiral, as the starting material (Z)-oct-4-ene leads to a chiral epoxide, which upon ring-opening produces a diol with two stereocenters that are not symmetric.

3. **Chromatographic Analysis**:
   - **Standard (achiral) HPLC**: 
     - The achiral diol from Reaction 1 will appear as a single peak.
     - The chiral diol from Reaction 2 will also appear as a single peak because achiral columns do not separate enantiomers.
     - Total peaks in standard HPLC: **2 peaks**.
   - **Chiral HPLC**:
     - The achiral diol from Reaction 1 will appear as a single peak.
     - The chiral diol from Reaction 2 will split into two peaks corresponding to its enantiomers.
     - Total peaks in chiral HPLC: **3 peaks**.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The standard HPLC will show 2 peaks, and the chiral HPLC will show 3 peaks.
