Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem, and honestly, it's a bit tricky because I need to figure out the reactions and the compounds involved. Let me go through the problem step by step.

First, the question is about a series of reactions leading to a product E, and then determining the molecular symmetry group of E. The options are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. I remember that these are point groups, which describe the symmetry of molecules. So, the key is to figure out what E is, and then determine its molecular structure to assign the correct point group.

Let me start by breaking down the reactions given.

1. **Reaction 1:** Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. 
   - So, A + 8 B → C
   - Bright red product makes me think of something like a transition metal compound. Maybe copper or another metal with colored compounds.

2. **Reaction 2:** C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
   - C + 2 D → E
   - E is hazardous, so perhaps a gas like chlorine or a highly reactive compound. Alternatively, maybe a strong acid or something explosive.

3. **Reaction 3:** C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is weak.
   - C + H2O → A + F + G
   - The production of two acids suggests that C might be a salt that, when hydrolyzed, produces two different acids. For example, maybe a metal sulfide reacting with water to produce a strong acid like H2SO4 and a weak acid, but I'm not sure yet.

4. **Reaction 4:** D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent.
   - D + B → H (solvent)
   - Common solvents include water, ethanol, maybe something like HCl (but that's a gas, not a solvent). Alternatively, maybe H is something like H2O if B and D are O2 and H2? Hmm, not sure.

Let me try to think about possible candidates for each compound.

Starting with reaction 4: D and B combine in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. Let's think about gases that could combine in 1:1 ratio. For example, H2O is a solvent. How is H2O formed? From H2 and O2 in a 2:1 ratio, but the reaction here is 1:1. Alternatively, if B is H2 and D is O2, then H would be H2O. But 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. Doesn't match 1:1. Hmm, maybe another reaction.

Wait, maybe B and D are other gases. Let's think about other solvents. Maybe D and B are NH3 and HCl? But they would react in a 1:1 ratio to form NH4Cl, which is a solid, not a solvent. Or perhaps D is CO2 and B is something else. Not sure. Alternatively, D could be H2S and B is O2, but that doesn't seem to form a solvent.

Alternatively, maybe H is something like ethanol or another organic solvent. But I'm not getting it. Let me think of other possibilities. Hmm, D and B could be H2 and Cl2, but that forms HCl, which is a gas, not a solvent. Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is another gas to form H2O? But the stoichiometry doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps B is Cl2 and D is another gas. Let's see. Alternatively, maybe B is H2 and D is Cl2, but 1:1 ratio would form HCl, which is a gas. Doesn't fit the solvent.

Alternatively, maybe B is NH3 and D is something else. But NH3 is a gas, D could be HCl, but then H would be NH4Cl, which is a solid. Not a solvent.

Hmm, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's think about reaction 3: when C reacts with water, it produces A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, C could be a metal carbonate, which when hydrolyzed produces a metal oxide (A), CO2, and perhaps another acid. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfide, which when hydrolyzed produces a metal hydroxide and H2S? But H2S is a weak acid. Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride, which would produce NH3 and a metal hydroxide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: if C is a sulfite (like Na2SO3), then reacting with water might produce sulfurous acid (H2SO3, which is a weak acid) and sodium hydroxide (strong base, but the problem says two acids. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal chloride. Wait, if C is a chlorate or something else, maybe. Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate, like Na2CO3. Then, when it reacts with water, it would hydrolyze into 2 NaOH (strong base) and CO2 (which is a weak acid, but in this case, CO2 is a gas, not a solution acid). Wait, but the reaction produces two acids F and G. So, maybe it's not a carbonate.

Wait, another thought: maybe C is a metal nitrate. When nitrates hydrolyze, they produce nitric acid (strong acid) and some other products. Wait, but nitric acid is a strong acid, but I'm not sure about the other product. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfide, which when hydrolyzed produces H2S (weak acid) and a metal hydroxide. But again, not two acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal carbide, like CaC2. When metal carbides react with water, they produce acetylene (which is a gas, not an acid) and a strong base (like Ca(OH)2). Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal bicarbonate, but I'm not sure.

Let me think again about reaction 1: A reacts with 8 equivalents of B to form C. So A + 8 B → C.

If A is a metal, and B is a halogen, say Cl2. Wait, 8 equivalents would mean 8 moles of Cl2 per mole of A. That seems like a lot. For example, if A is Fe, then 8 Cl2 would give FeCl4, but iron typically forms FeCl2 and FeCl3, which have 2 and 3 Cl per Fe. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, another approach: maybe C is a transition metal complex. For instance, if A is copper (Cu), B is ammonia (NH3), but ammonia is a gas. Wait, 8 equivalents of NH3 reacting with Cu to form a complex. But when Cu reacts with NH3, it forms complexes like [Cu(NH3)4]^2+.

Wait, but in this case, the product C is bright red. Hmm, copper complexes can be blue or other colors, but maybe it's a different metal. Wait, what about iron? Iron(III) complexes can be yellow or brown. Alternatively, maybe chromium? I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps B is CO, which is a gas. Then 8 CO molecules would form a carbonyl complex. For example, Fe(CO)5 is a liquid, though, not a solid. Alternatively, maybe A is nickel and B is CO, forming Ni(CO)4, which is a liquid. Hmm, but the product C is a solid, which this is not.

Alternatively, perhaps B is H2S, which is a gas. So A + 8 H2S → C. If A is a metal like Fe, then FeS is a solid, but 8 H2S would be a lot. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A is Fe, B is O2. Then 8 O2 would form FeO4^4- or something? I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe C is a metal sulfide. For example, if A is Fe and B is S, then FeS is formed. But FeS is black, not bright red. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide. But I'm not sure about the bright red color.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about reaction 2: C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. So, perhaps E is a highly toxic gas like HCN or something similar, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, E could be a highly explosive compound, like nitroglycerin, but that's a liquid. Or maybe a gas like phosgene, but that's also a gas. Alternatively, E could be a strong oxidizing agent like ClF3, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another possibility: if C is a metal chloride, then reacting with D (maybe F2) could form a more highly oxidized chloride. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe D is a strong oxidizing gas, like Cl2 or F2. So, when C reacts with D, it forms E, which is something dangerous.

Wait, going back to reaction 3: C reacting with water gives back A plus two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). So, let's say C is something that, when hydrolyzed, produces two acids. Maybe a metal nitrate? Let's see. For example, if C is Cu(NO3)2, then hydrolysis would produce HNO3 (strong acid) and another acid? Or maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal sulfide. Wait, but metal sulfides hydrolyze to produce H2S (weak acid) and a metal hydroxide, which is a base, not an acid. Hmm, that doesn't fit because F and G are both acids.

Wait another thought: maybe C is a metal hydroxide. No, because when you add water, it wouldn't necessarily produce two acids. Alternatively, maybe C is a carbonate: like Na2CO3. Then, when it reacts with water, it's already in an aqueous solution, but that doesn't produce two acids. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal bicarbonate, but I don't think reacting with water would produce two acids. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal nitrate. Wait, let's take Mg(NO3)2. When it reacts with water, it dissociates into Mg^2+ and NO3^-; no acid is formed unless it's hydrolyzed. The hydrolysis of Mg(NO3)2 would produce some HNO3, but I'm not sure if it would produce two acids.

Alternatively, maybe C is something like ammonium nitrate, but then adding water would just dissolve it, not necessarily produce two acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal sulfate. Let's say BaSO4. No, that's not soluble. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal phosphate. When phosphate salts hydrolyze, they produce H3PO4, which is a weak acid. But again, not two acids.

Wait, maybe C is a mixed salt. For example, if C is a compound that, when hydrolyzed, gives two different acids. Like maybe NaHSO4. When NaHSO4 is dissolved in water, it can dissociate into Na+ and HSO4^-; HSO4^- can act as an acid or a base. But that's just one acid.

Wait, maybe C is a metal sulfite. Let's say CaSO3. When it reacts with water, it might hydrolyze into H2SO3 (sulfurous acid, weak) and Ca(OH)2 (strong base). But F and G are both acids, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me try a different approach. Let me think about reaction 4: D and B combine in 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. So, D + B → H (solvent).

If H is a common solvent like H2O, then D and B would need to combine to form H2O. For example, H2 (D) and O2 (B) in a 2:1 ratio would form H2O, but the reaction here is 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe H is ethanol. Then D and B would be something that can form ethanol. Like if D is CH3CH2OH (but that's a liquid, not a gas) or perhaps D is another reactant.

Wait, maybe H is something like NH3, but NH3 is a gas. Or maybe H is something like CH3OH (methanol), which is a solvent. So, how to get CH3OH from D and B? Maybe D is CO and B is H2. The reaction would require CO + 2H2 → CH3OH, but that's not a 1:1 ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is CO + H2 → something else, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps H is H2O, and D and B are H2 and O2. But the stoichiometry is off.

Wait, another solvent: maybe H is HCl, but that's a gas. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe H is HF, but that's a gas as well.

Wait, perhaps H is an alcohol like ethanol. So, ethanol is formed from something. Let me think: maybe D is water (H2O) and B is ethylene (C2H4). But I'm not sure about the reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps D is H2 and B is something else. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should focus on reaction 2. If C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. Let's suppose that D is F2 (fluorine gas), which is highly reactive. Then, C reacting with F2 would form CF4 (which is inert), but that's not dangerous. Alternatively, if C is a metal, then C + F2 would form a metal fluoride, which is not extremely hazardous, unless it's something like sodium fluoride, which is actually used in toothpaste.

Alternatively, maybe D is Cl2. Then C + 2 Cl2 → E. If C is a metal, say copper, then Cu + 2 Cl2 → CuCl4^2- (but that's in solution). Alternatively, if C is a sulfide, like FeS, then FeS + 2 Cl2 → FeCl3 + 2 HCl (g). Hmm, but E would be a mixture, not a single product.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a highly toxic gas like HCN. So, if C is a metal cyanide, and D is H2O or something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe E is a strong acid like H2SO4, but that would require D to be SO3 and C to have some oxygen, which I'm not sure about.

Wait, another thought: reaction 3 produces F and G as two different acids. F is strong, G is weak. So, maybe F is H2SO4 (strong) and G is H2CO3 (weak), but that depends on C's composition.

Alternatively, maybe F is HCl (strong) and G is H2S (weak). But then C would have to be something like a metal sulfide. Let's think: when a metal sulfide reacts with water, it produces H2S gas and a metal hydroxide. But in this case, the products are A, F, and G. So F and G are acids, which suggests that perhaps the hydrolysis produces two acids, not a base and a gas. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: C is a metal nitride, which reacts with water to produce NH3 (a weak base) and a metal hydroxide. But that would produce a base and another base, not two acids. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal carbide. For example, CaC2 reacts with water to produce acetylene (C2H2, which is a gas) and calcium hydroxide. But again, that's a base, not an acid.

Hmm, maybe C is a metal oxide. For example, if C is Na2O, reacting with water would produce NaOH (strong base) and H2O, but that's not two acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal hydride. For example, NaH reacts with water to produce NaOH and H2. But again, not acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide with acidic properties. For example, some metal oxides are amphoteric. So, if C is Al2O3, which is amphoteric, then reacting with water might produce some acidic solution. But I'm not sure about the specifics.

Wait, maybe C is a carbonate. Let's say C is Na2CO3. Reacting with water would dissolve it into 2 Na+ and CO3^2−, but that doesn't produce two acids. Wait, but if C is a bicarbonate, like NaHCO3, then reacting with water would just keep it as a solution, but again, not producing two acids.

Hmm, maybe C is a sulfite. Like Na2SO3. When it reacts with water, it hydrolyzes to produce H2SO3 (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base). So that gives one acid and a base. Doesn't fit because the products are two acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfate. For example, BaSO4 doesn't react with water, but maybe another sulfate. Alternatively, maybe C is a hydroxide that's amphoteric, like Al(OH)3. Reacting with water might not do much, but if it's heated...

Alternatively, maybe C is a superoxide, like KO2. Reacting with water produces O2 and KOH. But that still doesn't give two acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal oxide that reacts with water to produce a strong acid and another acid. Wait, how? For example, maybe C is a metal oxide that's a peroxide. Like Na2O2. Reacting with water produces NaOH and O2. But that's a base and a gas.

Hmm, I'm going in circles. Maybe I should think about reaction 2 again. If C + 2 D → E, and E is extremely hazardous, maybe E is something like sarin gas or another nerve agent, but that's probably beyond the scope here. Alternatively, E could be a highly reactive compound like ozone or something else.

Wait, another angle: perhaps E is a highly toxic gas like phosgene (COCl2), but how would that form? If C is CO and D is Cl2, then CO + 2 Cl2 → COCl2 + Cl2? No, that's not balanced. Alternatively, maybe C is something else.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal chloride, and D is another chloride. For example, if C is FeCl3 and D is Cl2, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Alternatively, perhaps D is O2. So C + 2 O2 → E. If C is a hydrocarbon, E could be CO2 or something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about reaction 4 again. D + B → H, a solvent. If H is H2O, then perhaps D and B are H2 and O2 in a 2:1 ratio. But the problem states a 1:1 ratio, so maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe D is NH3 and B is HCl, but that would form NH4Cl, which is a salt, not a solvent.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps D and B are H2O and another gas, but I can't think of a 1:1 combination that forms a solvent. Maybe D is O2 and B is H2O? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another possibility: H is ethanol. Then, D and B might be something like ethylene (C2H4) and H2O. But I don't know the reaction. Alternatively, H is methanol, formed from CO and H2 in a 1:1 ratio? Let me think: CO + 2 H2 → CH3OH. But that's a 2:1 ratio, not 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe H is an alcohol, and D and B are a carbonyl and hydrogen. But I'm not certain.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should make some assumptions based on the given information.

Let me start by assuming that A is copper (Cu), a solid. Then, B is a gas that reacts with Cu in a 8:1 ratio to form C, which is bright red. Copper(II) oxide is black, but maybe it's a different compound.

Wait, another possibility: B is ammonia (NH3). Copper reacts with excess ammonia to form [Cu(NH3)4]^2+ complexes, which are deep blue. Not bright red.

Alternatively, B could be H2S. Copper reacts with H2S to form CuS, which is black, not red.

Hmm. Maybe A is not copper. Let me think of another metal.

What about iron? If A is iron, and B is something else.

Wait, another thought: bright red product. Could it be Fe(OH)3? No, that's a reddish-brown precipitate. Alternatively, maybe a chromium compound? Chromium(III) oxide is green. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a nitrate. Wait, sodium nitrate is colorless, but maybe another nitrate is red. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfide. For example, FeS is black, but maybe another sulfide is red.

Wait, I'm not getting anywhere. Let me think about reaction 3 again. C + H2O → A + F + G, where F is strong acid and G is weak.

Perhaps F is H2SO4 (strong) and G is H2CO3 (weak). So, C would need to contain both SO4^2− and CO3^2−. Hmm, but that's not a common combination.

Alternatively, F could be HCl (strong) and G could be H2S (weak). So, C would be something that, when hydrolyzed, produces HCl and H2S. That would imply C contains both Cl and S. Maybe C is a compound like CuS, but that's not likely because CuS is not soluble in water.

Wait, perhaps C is a compound like FeS. When FeS reacts with water, it produces Fe(OH)2 (which is a base, not an acid) and H2S gas. But in this case, the products are A (Fe), F (H2S, weak acid), and G (maybe something else, but not a strong acid). Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal carbonate, like Na2CO3. Reacting with water would produce NaOH (strong base) and CO2 (weak acid, but in gas form). So, F would be CO2 (weak acid), but G would be NaOH, which is a base, not an acid. Doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal sulfate. For example, Al2(SO4)3. Reacting with water would just dissolve, not produce acids. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal hydroxide that's amphoteric. For example, Al(OH)3. Reacting with water might not do much, but when heated, it could decompose.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal oxide. Let me try: if C is Na2O, reacting with water gives NaOH. But that's a base, not two acids.

Alternatively, maybe C is a peroxide. For example, Na2O2. Reacting with water produces O2 and NaOH. Again, a base and a gas, not two acids.

I'm stuck again. Maybe I should consider that F and G are not the typical strong and weak acids but perhaps something else. For example, F could be HNO3 (strong) and G could be H2SO3 (weak). So, C would have to contain both N and S.

Wait, maybe C is a compound like Cu(NO3)2·H2SO4. No, that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate and a sulfate, but that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixed carbonate and sulfate, but again, not common.

Wait, another thought: when C reacts with water, it could release two different acids, implying that C contains two different acid anions. For example, if C is a salt of two different weak acids. But then, how would that happen?

Wait, perhaps C is a metal sulfite. Then, when it reacts with water, it could hydrolyze into H2SO3 (weak acid) and the metal hydroxide. But again, one acid and a base.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal bicarbonate, like NaHCO3. It would react with water to produce H2CO3 (weak) and NaOH (strong base). But again, one acid and a base.

Hmm. Maybe I should think of C as a metal carbide. For example, if C is CaC2, reacting with water gives C2H2 (which is a gas, maybe considered an acid?), but that's not an acid. Also, produces Ca(OH)2 (base). So, that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe C is a metal azide. Reacting with water might produce some nitrogen compounds, but I'm not sure.

This is getting too complicated. Let me try a different approach. Let me think about the possible point groups. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

D∞h symmetry is typical for linear molecules with a center of inversion and multiple mirror planes. For example, CO2 is linear but has D∞h symmetry. Wait, no, CO2 is linear and has D∞h symmetry. But CO2 is a gas, not a solid.

Wait, but E is extremely hazardous. If E is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry, it might be something like phosgene (O=C=O), which is a highly toxic gas. Phosgene is a linear molecule, so its point group is D∞h. Alternatively, O3 (ozone) has a bent structure with C2v symmetry.

Wait, another possibility: E could be something like HCN, which is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry. HCN is a highly toxic gas.

Alternatively, if E is a molecule with C2 symmetry, like a bent structure. For example, O3 has C2v symmetry, but H2O has C2v as well. Wait, H2O has a V shape, so C2v symmetry.

Wait, but I'm not sure what E is. Let me think about the reactions again.

If C reacts with D (gas) to form E. If E is phosgene (O=C=O), then D could be CO2 and maybe another reactant. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if E is HCN, then D could be CN- and something else.

Alternatively, E could be a diatomic molecule like Cl2, which has D∞h symmetry. But Cl2 is a gas, not extremely hazardous beyond being a strong oxidizer.

Wait, another approach: if E has D∞h symmetry, it's likely a linear molecule. So what linear molecules are highly dangerous? Maybe sarin gas, which is an organophosphate with a structure that includes a phosphoryl group attached to an alkyl chain. But sarin's structure is more complex, perhaps with a trigonal planar or other symmetry.

Alternatively, maybe E is a molecule like cyanide (CN-), but as a gas, it's HCN.

Wait, HCN is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry. That fits. So if E is HCN, then what would C and D be?

In reaction 2, C + 2 D → E. So, C + 2 D → HCN. Let's think: HCN can be formed from reactions involving cyanide ions or other sources.

Wait, another reaction: HCN can be produced by the reaction of CH3CN (acetonitrile) with strong acids, but that's not relevant here. Alternatively, HCN can be formed from the reaction of NaCN with H2SO4 (strong acid), but that's in solution.

Hmm, maybe I'm way off here. Let me try to see if E could be something else with D∞h symmetry.

Wait, another possibility: O=C=O is phosgene, which is a highly toxic gas. Phosgene has D∞h symmetry. So, if E is phosgene, then C + 2 D → O=C=O.

How would that happen? Maybe C is something like CO2, but adding D would need to produce O=C=O, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps C is a chlorinated compound, but not sure.

Wait, maybe C is a chlorinated carbon compound. For example, if C is CCl2F2, and D is something else. No, that's not leading anywhere.

Alternatively, perhaps E is HCN, so D is something that reacts with C to produce HCN. For example, if D is H2 and C is a cyanide salt. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is NaCN and D is H2SO4. Then, NaCN + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + HCN↑. So, 2 equivalents of H2SO4 per NaCN would produce 1 equivalent of HCN. But in this case, the reaction would be NaCN + 2 H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + H2O + SO2↑ + HCN↑. Not exact, but perhaps.

Wait, but in this case, D would be H2SO4, a liquid, but the problem says D is a gas. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps D is Cl2 and C is CH4. Then, CH4 + 2 Cl2 → CCl4 + 2 HCl. But that doesn't produce a linear molecule like HCN or phosgene.

Hmm, this is getting too speculative. Let me try to think about the possible options for E and match them with the symmetry groups.

Option B is D4h, which is a common symmetry for molecules like SO2 (sulfur dioxide), which is a bent molecule. Wait, SO2 has D4h symmetry? No, wait. SO2 is a bent molecule with a bond angle around 120 degrees. Its point group is D3h, which is not one of the options. Hmm.

Option D is C2v, which is the symmetry of water (H2O), which is a bent molecule with a bond angle of about 104.5 degrees. Another example is O3 (ozone), which has a bent structure with C2v symmetry.

Option C is D∞h, which is linear molecules like CO2 and HCN.

If E is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry, then options are CO2, HCN, phosgene, etc.

But CO2 is a gas, not extremely hazardous beyond causing asphyxiation. Phosgene is a highly toxic gas, as is HCN. So, E could be either.

If E is HCN, then it's a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry. So option C would be the answer.

But wait, let me check the other reactions again. If E is HCN, then C + 2 D → HCN.

Assuming D is H2 (a gas), then C would have to react with H2 to produce HCN. That would imply that C is (HCN minus H2), which would be CN−. So, perhaps C is a cyanide salt.

But earlier, in reaction 3: C reacts with water to produce A, F, and G. If C is NaCN, then NaCN + H2O → NaOH + HCN. So, F would be HCN (weak acid) and G would be NaOH (strong base). But the problem states F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid. So that doesn't fit because NaOH is a base, not an acid.

Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe E is not HCN.

Let me think again: If E is phosgene (O=C=O), then reaction 2 would be C + 2 D → O=C=O.

Phosgene is produced from the reaction of CO with chlorine gas in the presence of a catalyst. So, CO + Cl2 → COCl2 (phosgene). But in that case, the stoichiometry is 1 CO + 1 Cl2 → 1 COCl2. So, 1:1 ratio, but the reaction states 2 equivalents of D (Cl2) per C. Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, maybe in the reaction, C is CO, and D is Cl2, but in a 2:1 ratio. So, CO + 2 Cl2 → COCl2 + Cl2? That doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is C + 2 D → 2 E, but the problem states 2 equivalents of D produce E. So perhaps C + 2 D → E.

Alternatively, perhaps C is something else. But I'm not making progress.

If I can't figure out E, perhaps I should consider what the point groups look like and which options make sense for a dangerous gas.

Option D4h is for molecules like SO2, which is a gas, but not extremely hazardous in small amounts. D∞h would be for linear molecules like CO2, which isn't extremely hazardous, but phosgene (O=C=O) is a highly toxic gas with D∞h symmetry. So if E is phosgene, then the answer would be D∞h, option C.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, another thought: perhaps E is a molecule like SF6, which is a gas, but SF6 is non-toxic but contributes to global warming. Hmm, but it's not extremely hazardous.

Alternatively, E could be H2S, which is toxic but has a different symmetry. H2S is V-shaped, so its point group is C2v, option D. But H2S isn't extremely hazardous in the sense of being a war gas or something, but it's toxic.

Wait, another possibility: E is Cl2, which is a gas with D∞h symmetry. Cl2 is a strong oxidizer and highly dangerous, but I'm not sure if it fits all the reactions.

If E is Cl2, then reaction 2 would be C + 2 D → Cl2. So, what's C and D in that case?

Wait, Cl2 can be produced by the decomposition of HClO (hypochlorous acid) or other chlorinated compounds, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is HCl and D is another chloride. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: perhaps C is a chloride salt, and D is another chloride. But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal and D is a chloride gas. For example, if C is Fe and D is Cl2, then Fe reacts with Cl2 to form FeCl3. But that's a solid, not a gas. So E would be FeCl3, which is a solid, but the problem states E is a product, possibly a gas. Hmm.

Another possibility: E is O3 (ozone). Ozone is a bent molecule with C2v symmetry (option D). Ozone is a strong oxidizer and is toxic in high concentrations. So if E is O3, then the symmetry group would be C2v.

But how would O3 form? From reaction 2: C + 2 D → O3.

Ozone is formed by the reaction of oxygen with UV light: 2 O2 → 2 O3. So, if C is O2 and D is O2, but that's not a 1:2 ratio. Alternatively, C could be some other compound.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to make an educated guess based on the information.

Given that E is extremely hazardous and likely a gas, and considering the symmetry options, I think E is phosgene (O=C=O), which has D∞h symmetry. So the answer would be option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of a highly hazardous product, E, formed through a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. This suggests C could be a transition metal compound, though the exact identity remains unclear.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. This indicates E is likely a toxic gas with significant reactivity.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). This implies C contains elements that can hydrolyze to form acids, but the exact nature of C is not definitively determined.

4. **Reaction 4**: D and B react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. This provides limited clues about the identity of D and B.

### Key Considerations for E:
- E is described as extremely hazardous, which narrows it down to highly toxic gases like phosgene (O=C=O) or hydrogen cyanide (HCN).
- The symmetry group of E must be determined from the options: **C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v**.

### Analysis of Symmetry Groups:
- **C2**: Suggests a molecule with a single twofold axis of rotation, such as water (H2O), but H2O is not extremely hazardous.
- **D4h**: Indicates a molecule with multiple symmetry elements, such as sulfur dioxide (SO2), but SO2 is not extremely hazardous.
- **D∞h**: Characteristic of linear molecules like carbon dioxide (CO2) or phosgene (O=C=O). Phosgene is a highly toxic gas, aligning with the description of E.
- **C2v**: Applicable to bent molecules like ozone (O3), which is toxic but not as extreme as phosgene.

### Conclusion:
Given the description of E as extremely hazardous and the symmetry options, **phosgene (O=C=O)** is the most plausible candidate. Phosgene is a linear molecule with **D∞h symmetry**, making it the best match for the given conditions.

Answer: C

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem, and honestly, it's a bit tricky because I need to figure out the reactions and the compounds involved. Let me go through the problem step by step.

First, the question is about a series of reactions leading to a product E, and then determining the molecular symmetry group of E. The options are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. I remember that these are point groups, which describe the symmetry of molecules. So, the key is to figure out what E is, and then determine its molecular structure to assign the correct point group.

Let me start by breaking down the reactions given.

1. **Reaction 1:** Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. 
   - So, A + 8 B → C
   - Bright red product makes me think of something like a transition metal compound. Maybe copper or another metal with colored compounds.

2. **Reaction 2:** C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
   - C + 2 D → E
   - E is hazardous, so perhaps a gas like chlorine or a highly reactive compound. Alternatively, maybe a strong acid or something explosive.

3. **Reaction 3:** C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is weak.
   - C + H2O → A + F + G
   - The production of two acids suggests that C might be a salt that, when hydrolyzed, produces two different acids. For example, maybe a metal sulfide reacting with water to produce a strong acid like H2SO4 and a weak acid, but I'm not sure yet.

4. **Reaction 4:** D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent.
   - D + B → H (solvent)
   - Common solvents include water, ethanol, maybe something like HCl (but that's a gas, not a solvent). Alternatively, maybe H is something like H2O if B and D are O2 and H2? Hmm, not sure.

Let me try to think about possible candidates for each compound.

Starting with reaction 4: D and B combine in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. Let's think about gases that could combine in 1:1 ratio. For example, H2O is a solvent. How is H2O formed? From H2 and O2 in a 2:1 ratio, but the reaction here is 1:1. Alternatively, if B is H2 and D is O2, then H would be H2O. But 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. Doesn't match 1:1. Hmm, maybe another reaction.

Wait, maybe B and D are other gases. Let's think about other solvents. Maybe D and B are NH3 and HCl? But they would react in a 1:1 ratio to form NH4Cl, which is a solid, not a solvent. Or perhaps D is CO2 and B is something else. Not sure. Alternatively, D could be H2S and B is O2, but that doesn't seem to form a solvent.

Alternatively, maybe H is something like ethanol or another organic solvent. But I'm not getting it. Let me think of other possibilities. Hmm, D and B could be H2 and Cl2, but that forms HCl, which is a gas, not a solvent. Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is another gas to form H2O? But the stoichiometry doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps B is Cl2 and D is another gas. Let's see. Alternatively, maybe B is H2 and D is Cl2, but 1:1 ratio would form HCl, which is a gas. Doesn't fit the solvent.

Alternatively, maybe B is NH3 and D is something else. But NH3 is a gas, D could be HCl, but then H would be NH4Cl, which is a solid. Not a solvent.

Hmm, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's think about reaction 3: when C reacts with water, it produces A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, C could be a metal carbonate, which when hydrolyzed produces a metal oxide (A), CO2, and perhaps another acid. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfide, which when hydrolyzed produces a metal hydroxide and H2S? But H2S is a weak acid. Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride, which would produce NH3 and a metal hydroxide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: if C is a sulfite (like Na2SO3), then reacting with water might produce sulfurous acid (H2SO3, which is a weak acid) and sodium hydroxide (strong base, but the problem says two acids. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal chloride. Wait, if C is a chlorate or something else, maybe. Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate, like Na2CO3. Then, when it reacts with water, it would hydrolyze into 2 NaOH (strong base) and CO2 (which is a weak acid, but in this case, CO2 is a gas, not a solution acid). Wait, but the reaction produces two acids F and G. So, maybe it's not a carbonate.

Wait, another thought: maybe C is a metal nitrate. When nitrates hydrolyze, they produce nitric acid (strong acid) and some other products. Wait, but nitric acid is a strong acid, but I'm not sure about the other product. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfide, which when hydrolyzed produces H2S (weak acid) and a metal hydroxide. But again, not two acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal carbide, like CaC2. When metal carbides react with water, they produce acetylene (which is a gas, not an acid) and a strong base (like Ca(OH)2). Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal bicarbonate, but I'm not sure.

Let me think again about reaction 1: A reacts with 8 equivalents of B to form C. So A + 8 B → C.

If A is a metal, and B is a halogen, say Cl2. Wait, 8 equivalents would mean 8 moles of Cl2 per mole of A. That seems like a lot. For example, if A is Fe, then 8 Cl2 would give FeCl4, but iron typically forms FeCl2 and FeCl3, which have 2 and 3 Cl per Fe. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, another approach: maybe C is a transition metal complex. For instance, if A is copper (Cu), B is ammonia (NH3), but ammonia is a gas. Wait, 8 equivalents of NH3 reacting with Cu to form a complex. But when Cu reacts with NH3, it forms complexes like [Cu(NH3)4]^2+.

Wait, but in this case, the product C is bright red. Hmm, copper complexes can be blue or other colors, but maybe it's a different metal. Wait, what about iron? Iron(III) complexes can be yellow or brown. Alternatively, maybe chromium? I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps B is CO, which is a gas. Then 8 CO molecules would form a carbonyl complex. For example, Fe(CO)5 is a liquid, though, not a solid. Alternatively, maybe A is nickel and B is CO, forming Ni(CO)4, which is a liquid. Hmm, but the product C is a solid, which this is not.

Alternatively, perhaps B is H2S, which is a gas. So A + 8 H2S → C. If A is a metal like Fe, then FeS is a solid, but 8 H2S would be a lot. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A is Fe, B is O2. Then 8 O2 would form FeO4^4- or something? I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe C is a metal sulfide. For example, if A is Fe and B is S, then FeS is formed. But FeS is black, not bright red. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide. But I'm not sure about the bright red color.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about reaction 2: C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. So, perhaps E is a highly toxic gas like HCN or something similar, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, E could be a highly explosive compound, like nitroglycerin, but that's a liquid. Or maybe a gas like phosgene, but that's also a gas. Alternatively, E could be a strong oxidizing agent like ClF3, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another possibility: if C is a metal chloride, then reacting with D (maybe F2) could form a more highly oxidized chloride. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe D is a strong oxidizing gas, like Cl2 or F2. So, when C reacts with D, it forms E, which is something dangerous.

Wait, going back to reaction 3: C reacting with water gives back A plus two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). So, let's say C is something that, when hydrolyzed, produces two acids. Maybe a metal nitrate? Let's see. For example, if C is Cu(NO3)2, then hydrolysis would produce HNO3 (strong acid) and another acid? Or maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal sulfide. Wait, but metal sulfides hydrolyze to produce H2S (weak acid) and a metal hydroxide, which is a base, not an acid. Hmm, that doesn't fit because F and G are both acids.

Wait another thought: maybe C is a metal hydroxide. No, because when you add water, it wouldn't necessarily produce two acids. Alternatively, maybe C is a carbonate: like Na2CO3. Then, when it reacts with water, it's already in an aqueous solution, but that doesn't produce two acids. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal bicarbonate, but I don't think reacting with water would produce two acids. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal nitrate. Wait, let's take Mg(NO3)2. When it reacts with water, it dissociates into Mg^2+ and NO3^-; no acid is formed unless it's hydrolyzed. The hydrolysis of Mg(NO3)2 would produce some HNO3, but I'm not sure if it would produce two acids.

Alternatively, maybe C is something like ammonium nitrate, but then adding water would just dissolve it, not necessarily produce two acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal sulfate. Let's say BaSO4. No, that's not soluble. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal phosphate. When phosphate salts hydrolyze, they produce H3PO4, which is a weak acid. But again, not two acids.

Wait, maybe C is a mixed salt. For example, if C is a compound that, when hydrolyzed, gives two different acids. Like maybe NaHSO4. When NaHSO4 is dissolved in water, it can dissociate into Na+ and HSO4^-; HSO4^- can act as an acid or a base. But that's just one acid.

Wait, maybe C is a metal sulfite. Let's say CaSO3. When it reacts with water, it might hydrolyze into H2SO3 (sulfurous acid, weak) and Ca(OH)2 (strong base). But F and G are both acids, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me try a different approach. Let me think about reaction 4: D and B combine in 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. So, D + B → H (solvent).

If H is a common solvent like H2O, then D and B would need to combine to form H2O. For example, H2 (D) and O2 (B) in a 2:1 ratio would form H2O, but the reaction here is 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe H is ethanol. Then D and B would be something that can form ethanol. Like if D is CH3CH2OH (but that's a liquid, not a gas) or perhaps D is another reactant.

Wait, maybe H is something like NH3, but NH3 is a gas. Or maybe H is something like CH3OH (methanol), which is a solvent. So, how to get CH3OH from D and B? Maybe D is CO and B is H2. The reaction would require CO + 2H2 → CH3OH, but that's not a 1:1 ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is CO + H2 → something else, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps H is H2O, and D and B are H2 and O2. But the stoichiometry is off.

Wait, another solvent: maybe H is HCl, but that's a gas. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe H is HF, but that's a gas as well.

Wait, perhaps H is an alcohol like ethanol. So, ethanol is formed from something. Let me think: maybe D is water (H2O) and B is ethylene (C2H4). But I'm not sure about the reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps D is H2 and B is something else. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should focus on reaction 2. If C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. Let's suppose that D is F2 (fluorine gas), which is highly reactive. Then, C reacting with F2 would form CF4 (which is inert), but that's not dangerous. Alternatively, if C is a metal, then C + F2 would form a metal fluoride, which is not extremely hazardous, unless it's something like sodium fluoride, which is actually used in toothpaste.

Alternatively, maybe D is Cl2. Then C + 2 Cl2 → E. If C is a metal, say copper, then Cu + 2 Cl2 → CuCl4^2- (but that's in solution). Alternatively, if C is a sulfide, like FeS, then FeS + 2 Cl2 → FeCl3 + 2 HCl (g). Hmm, but E would be a mixture, not a single product.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a highly toxic gas like HCN. So, if C is a metal cyanide, and D is H2O or something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe E is a strong acid like H2SO4, but that would require D to be SO3 and C to have some oxygen, which I'm not sure about.

Wait, another thought: reaction 3 produces F and G as two different acids. F is strong, G is weak. So, maybe F is H2SO4 (strong) and G is H2CO3 (weak), but that depends on C's composition.

Alternatively, maybe F is HCl (strong) and G is H2S (weak). But then C would have to be something like a metal sulfide. Let's think: when a metal sulfide reacts with water, it produces H2S gas and a metal hydroxide. But in this case, the products are A, F, and G. So F and G are acids, which suggests that perhaps the hydrolysis produces two acids, not a base and a gas. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: C is a metal nitride, which reacts with water to produce NH3 (a weak base) and a metal hydroxide. But that would produce a base and another base, not two acids. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal carbide. For example, CaC2 reacts with water to produce acetylene (C2H2, which is a gas) and calcium hydroxide. But again, that's a base, not an acid.

Hmm, maybe C is a metal oxide. For example, if C is Na2O, reacting with water would produce NaOH (strong base) and H2O, but that's not two acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal hydride. For example, NaH reacts with water to produce NaOH and H2. But again, not acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide with acidic properties. For example, some metal oxides are amphoteric. So, if C is Al2O3, which is amphoteric, then reacting with water might produce some acidic solution. But I'm not sure about the specifics.

Wait, maybe C is a carbonate. Let's say C is Na2CO3. Reacting with water would dissolve it into 2 Na+ and CO3^2−, but that doesn't produce two acids. Wait, but if C is a bicarbonate, like NaHCO3, then reacting with water would just keep it as a solution, but again, not producing two acids.

Hmm, maybe C is a sulfite. Like Na2SO3. When it reacts with water, it hydrolyzes to produce H2SO3 (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base). So that gives one acid and a base. Doesn't fit because the products are two acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfate. For example, BaSO4 doesn't react with water, but maybe another sulfate. Alternatively, maybe C is a hydroxide that's amphoteric, like Al(OH)3. Reacting with water might not do much, but if it's heated...

Alternatively, maybe C is a superoxide, like KO2. Reacting with water produces O2 and KOH. But that still doesn't give two acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal oxide that reacts with water to produce a strong acid and another acid. Wait, how? For example, maybe C is a metal oxide that's a peroxide. Like Na2O2. Reacting with water produces NaOH and O2. But that's a base and a gas.

Hmm, I'm going in circles. Maybe I should think about reaction 2 again. If C + 2 D → E, and E is extremely hazardous, maybe E is something like sarin gas or another nerve agent, but that's probably beyond the scope here. Alternatively, E could be a highly reactive compound like ozone or something else.

Wait, another angle: perhaps E is a highly toxic gas like phosgene (COCl2), but how would that form? If C is CO and D is Cl2, then CO + 2 Cl2 → COCl2 + Cl2? No, that's not balanced. Alternatively, maybe C is something else.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal chloride, and D is another chloride. For example, if C is FeCl3 and D is Cl2, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Alternatively, perhaps D is O2. So C + 2 O2 → E. If C is a hydrocarbon, E could be CO2 or something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about reaction 4 again. D + B → H, a solvent. If H is H2O, then perhaps D and B are H2 and O2 in a 2:1 ratio. But the problem states a 1:1 ratio, so maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe D is NH3 and B is HCl, but that would form NH4Cl, which is a salt, not a solvent.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps D and B are H2O and another gas, but I can't think of a 1:1 combination that forms a solvent. Maybe D is O2 and B is H2O? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another possibility: H is ethanol. Then, D and B might be something like ethylene (C2H4) and H2O. But I don't know the reaction. Alternatively, H is methanol, formed from CO and H2 in a 1:1 ratio? Let me think: CO + 2 H2 → CH3OH. But that's a 2:1 ratio, not 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe H is an alcohol, and D and B are a carbonyl and hydrogen. But I'm not certain.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should make some assumptions based on the given information.

Let me start by assuming that A is copper (Cu), a solid. Then, B is a gas that reacts with Cu in a 8:1 ratio to form C, which is bright red. Copper(II) oxide is black, but maybe it's a different compound.

Wait, another possibility: B is ammonia (NH3). Copper reacts with excess ammonia to form [Cu(NH3)4]^2+ complexes, which are deep blue. Not bright red.

Alternatively, B could be H2S. Copper reacts with H2S to form CuS, which is black, not red.

Hmm. Maybe A is not copper. Let me think of another metal.

What about iron? If A is iron, and B is something else.

Wait, another thought: bright red product. Could it be Fe(OH)3? No, that's a reddish-brown precipitate. Alternatively, maybe a chromium compound? Chromium(III) oxide is green. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a nitrate. Wait, sodium nitrate is colorless, but maybe another nitrate is red. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfide. For example, FeS is black, but maybe another sulfide is red.

Wait, I'm not getting anywhere. Let me think about reaction 3 again. C + H2O → A + F + G, where F is strong acid and G is weak.

Perhaps F is H2SO4 (strong) and G is H2CO3 (weak). So, C would need to contain both SO4^2− and CO3^2−. Hmm, but that's not a common combination.

Alternatively, F could be HCl (strong) and G could be H2S (weak). So, C would be something that, when hydrolyzed, produces HCl and H2S. That would imply C contains both Cl and S. Maybe C is a compound like CuS, but that's not likely because CuS is not soluble in water.

Wait, perhaps C is a compound like FeS. When FeS reacts with water, it produces Fe(OH)2 (which is a base, not an acid) and H2S gas. But in this case, the products are A (Fe), F (H2S, weak acid), and G (maybe something else, but not a strong acid). Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal carbonate, like Na2CO3. Reacting with water would produce NaOH (strong base) and CO2 (weak acid, but in gas form). So, F would be CO2 (weak acid), but G would be NaOH, which is a base, not an acid. Doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal sulfate. For example, Al2(SO4)3. Reacting with water would just dissolve, not produce acids. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal hydroxide that's amphoteric. For example, Al(OH)3. Reacting with water might not do much, but when heated, it could decompose.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal oxide. Let me try: if C is Na2O, reacting with water gives NaOH. But that's a base, not two acids.

Alternatively, maybe C is a peroxide. For example, Na2O2. Reacting with water produces O2 and NaOH. Again, a base and a gas, not two acids.

I'm stuck again. Maybe I should consider that F and G are not the typical strong and weak acids but perhaps something else. For example, F could be HNO3 (strong) and G could be H2SO3 (weak). So, C would have to contain both N and S.

Wait, maybe C is a compound like Cu(NO3)2·H2SO4. No, that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate and a sulfate, but that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixed carbonate and sulfate, but again, not common.

Wait, another thought: when C reacts with water, it could release two different acids, implying that C contains two different acid anions. For example, if C is a salt of two different weak acids. But then, how would that happen?

Wait, perhaps C is a metal sulfite. Then, when it reacts with water, it could hydrolyze into H2SO3 (weak acid) and the metal hydroxide. But again, one acid and a base.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal bicarbonate, like NaHCO3. It would react with water to produce H2CO3 (weak) and NaOH (strong base). But again, one acid and a base.

Hmm. Maybe I should think of C as a metal carbide. For example, if C is CaC2, reacting with water gives C2H2 (which is a gas, maybe considered an acid?), but that's not an acid. Also, produces Ca(OH)2 (base). So, that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe C is a metal azide. Reacting with water might produce some nitrogen compounds, but I'm not sure.

This is getting too complicated. Let me try a different approach. Let me think about the possible point groups. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

D∞h symmetry is typical for linear molecules with a center of inversion and multiple mirror planes. For example, CO2 is linear but has D∞h symmetry. Wait, no, CO2 is linear and has D∞h symmetry. But CO2 is a gas, not a solid.

Wait, but E is extremely hazardous. If E is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry, it might be something like phosgene (O=C=O), which is a highly toxic gas. Phosgene is a linear molecule, so its point group is D∞h. Alternatively, O3 (ozone) has a bent structure with C2v symmetry.

Wait, another possibility: E could be something like HCN, which is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry. HCN is a highly toxic gas.

Alternatively, if E is a molecule with C2 symmetry, like a bent structure. For example, O3 has C2v symmetry, but H2O has C2v as well. Wait, H2O has a V shape, so C2v symmetry.

Wait, but I'm not sure what E is. Let me think about the reactions again.

If C reacts with D (gas) to form E. If E is phosgene (O=C=O), then D could be CO2 and maybe another reactant. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if E is HCN, then D could be CN- and something else.

Alternatively, E could be a diatomic molecule like Cl2, which has D∞h symmetry. But Cl2 is a gas, not extremely hazardous beyond being a strong oxidizer.

Wait, another approach: if E has D∞h symmetry, it's likely a linear molecule. So what linear molecules are highly dangerous? Maybe sarin gas, which is an organophosphate with a structure that includes a phosphoryl group attached to an alkyl chain. But sarin's structure is more complex, perhaps with a trigonal planar or other symmetry.

Alternatively, maybe E is a molecule like cyanide (CN-), but as a gas, it's HCN.

Wait, HCN is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry. That fits. So if E is HCN, then what would C and D be?

In reaction 2, C + 2 D → E. So, C + 2 D → HCN. Let's think: HCN can be formed from reactions involving cyanide ions or other sources.

Wait, another reaction: HCN can be produced by the reaction of CH3CN (acetonitrile) with strong acids, but that's not relevant here. Alternatively, HCN can be formed from the reaction of NaCN with H2SO4 (strong acid), but that's in solution.

Hmm, maybe I'm way off here. Let me try to see if E could be something else with D∞h symmetry.

Wait, another possibility: O=C=O is phosgene, which is a highly toxic gas. Phosgene has D∞h symmetry. So, if E is phosgene, then C + 2 D → O=C=O.

How would that happen? Maybe C is something like CO2, but adding D would need to produce O=C=O, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps C is a chlorinated compound, but not sure.

Wait, maybe C is a chlorinated carbon compound. For example, if C is CCl2F2, and D is something else. No, that's not leading anywhere.

Alternatively, perhaps E is HCN, so D is something that reacts with C to produce HCN. For example, if D is H2 and C is a cyanide salt. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is NaCN and D is H2SO4. Then, NaCN + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + HCN↑. So, 2 equivalents of H2SO4 per NaCN would produce 1 equivalent of HCN. But in this case, the reaction would be NaCN + 2 H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + H2O + SO2↑ + HCN↑. Not exact, but perhaps.

Wait, but in this case, D would be H2SO4, a liquid, but the problem says D is a gas. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps D is Cl2 and C is CH4. Then, CH4 + 2 Cl2 → CCl4 + 2 HCl. But that doesn't produce a linear molecule like HCN or phosgene.

Hmm, this is getting too speculative. Let me try to think about the possible options for E and match them with the symmetry groups.

Option B is D4h, which is a common symmetry for molecules like SO2 (sulfur dioxide), which is a bent molecule. Wait, SO2 has D4h symmetry? No, wait. SO2 is a bent molecule with a bond angle around 120 degrees. Its point group is D3h, which is not one of the options. Hmm.

Option D is C2v, which is the symmetry of water (H2O), which is a bent molecule with a bond angle of about 104.5 degrees. Another example is O3 (ozone), which has a bent structure with C2v symmetry.

Option C is D∞h, which is linear molecules like CO2 and HCN.

If E is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry, then options are CO2, HCN, phosgene, etc.

But CO2 is a gas, not extremely hazardous beyond causing asphyxiation. Phosgene is a highly toxic gas, as is HCN. So, E could be either.

If E is HCN, then it's a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry. So option C would be the answer.

But wait, let me check the other reactions again. If E is HCN, then C + 2 D → HCN.

Assuming D is H2 (a gas), then C would have to react with H2 to produce HCN. That would imply that C is (HCN minus H2), which would be CN−. So, perhaps C is a cyanide salt.

But earlier, in reaction 3: C reacts with water to produce A, F, and G. If C is NaCN, then NaCN + H2O → NaOH + HCN. So, F would be HCN (weak acid) and G would be NaOH (strong base). But the problem states F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid. So that doesn't fit because NaOH is a base, not an acid.

Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe E is not HCN.

Let me think again: If E is phosgene (O=C=O), then reaction 2 would be C + 2 D → O=C=O.

Phosgene is produced from the reaction of CO with chlorine gas in the presence of a catalyst. So, CO + Cl2 → COCl2 (phosgene). But in that case, the stoichiometry is 1 CO + 1 Cl2 → 1 COCl2. So, 1:1 ratio, but the reaction states 2 equivalents of D (Cl2) per C. Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, maybe in the reaction, C is CO, and D is Cl2, but in a 2:1 ratio. So, CO + 2 Cl2 → COCl2 + Cl2? That doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is C + 2 D → 2 E, but the problem states 2 equivalents of D produce E. So perhaps C + 2 D → E.

Alternatively, perhaps C is something else. But I'm not making progress.

If I can't figure out E, perhaps I should consider what the point groups look like and which options make sense for a dangerous gas.

Option D4h is for molecules like SO2, which is a gas, but not extremely hazardous in small amounts. D∞h would be for linear molecules like CO2, which isn't extremely hazardous, but phosgene (O=C=O) is a highly toxic gas with D∞h symmetry. So if E is phosgene, then the answer would be D∞h, option C.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, another thought: perhaps E is a molecule like SF6, which is a gas, but SF6 is non-toxic but contributes to global warming. Hmm, but it's not extremely hazardous.

Alternatively, E could be H2S, which is toxic but has a different symmetry. H2S is V-shaped, so its point group is C2v, option D. But H2S isn't extremely hazardous in the sense of being a war gas or something, but it's toxic.

Wait, another possibility: E is Cl2, which is a gas with D∞h symmetry. Cl2 is a strong oxidizer and highly dangerous, but I'm not sure if it fits all the reactions.

If E is Cl2, then reaction 2 would be C + 2 D → Cl2. So, what's C and D in that case?

Wait, Cl2 can be produced by the decomposition of HClO (hypochlorous acid) or other chlorinated compounds, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is HCl and D is another chloride. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: perhaps C is a chloride salt, and D is another chloride. But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal and D is a chloride gas. For example, if C is Fe and D is Cl2, then Fe reacts with Cl2 to form FeCl3. But that's a solid, not a gas. So E would be FeCl3, which is a solid, but the problem states E is a product, possibly a gas. Hmm.

Another possibility: E is O3 (ozone). Ozone is a bent molecule with C2v symmetry (option D). Ozone is a strong oxidizer and is toxic in high concentrations. So if E is O3, then the symmetry group would be C2v.

But how would O3 form? From reaction 2: C + 2 D → O3.

Ozone is formed by the reaction of oxygen with UV light: 2 O2 → 2 O3. So, if C is O2 and D is O2, but that's not a 1:2 ratio. Alternatively, C could be some other compound.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to make an educated guess based on the information.

Given that E is extremely hazardous and likely a gas, and considering the symmetry options, I think E is phosgene (O=C=O), which has D∞h symmetry. So the answer would be option C.


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of a highly hazardous product, E, formed through a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. This suggests C could be a transition metal compound, though the exact identity remains unclear.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. This indicates E is likely a toxic gas with significant reactivity.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). This implies C contains elements that can hydrolyze to form acids, but the exact nature of C is not definitively determined.

4. **Reaction 4**: D and B react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. This provides limited clues about the identity of D and B.

### Key Considerations for E:
- E is described as extremely hazardous, which narrows it down to highly toxic gases like phosgene (O=C=O) or hydrogen cyanide (HCN).
- The symmetry group of E must be determined from the options: **C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v**.

### Analysis of Symmetry Groups:
- **C2**: Suggests a molecule with a single twofold axis of rotation, such as water (H2O), but H2O is not extremely hazardous.
- **D4h**: Indicates a molecule with multiple symmetry elements, such as sulfur dioxide (SO2), but SO2 is not extremely hazardous.
- **D∞h**: Characteristic of linear molecules like carbon dioxide (CO2) or phosgene (O=C=O). Phosgene is a highly toxic gas, aligning with the description of E.
- **C2v**: Applicable to bent molecules like ozone (O3), which is toxic but not as extreme as phosgene.

### Conclusion:
Given the description of E as extremely hazardous and the symmetry options, **phosgene (O=C=O)** is the most plausible candidate. Phosgene is a linear molecule with **D∞h symmetry**, making it the best match for the given conditions.
