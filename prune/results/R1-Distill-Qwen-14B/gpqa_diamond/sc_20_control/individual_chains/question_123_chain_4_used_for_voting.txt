Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about a supernova ejecta and the distance it travels from the galaxy's frame of reference. Hmm, let me think through this.

The question says that the ejecta and the galaxy are both in inertial frames. So, I guess that means we don't have to worry about acceleration or anything like that. The ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy, and from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, that's a really high speed, way faster than anything we usually deal with.

Wait, I remember something about time dilation and length contraction in special relativity. Since the frames are moving relative to each other, their measurements of time and distance will differ. But I'm not entirely sure how to apply that here.

Let me break it down. The problem is asking for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So, we need to relate the time in one frame to the other and then find the distance.

First, I think I should find the time that passes in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Because the frames are moving relative to each other, there's time dilation. The formula for time dilation is t' = gamma * (t - (v x)/c²), but wait, when the events are happening at the same place in one frame, like the time measured in the ejecta's frame is just t', then in another frame, it would be t = gamma * t'. But I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, no. Let me get this right. The time intervals are different depending on the frame. If the events (like the start and end of the 50 seconds) are happening at the same place in the ejecta's frame, then the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer due to time dilation. So, t = gamma * t'. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), right?

But wait, the speed given is 60,000 km/s. Let me convert that to meters per second to make calculations easier. Oh wait, maybe not. Let me see: 60,000 km/s is 6e4 km/s. The speed of light is about 3e5 km/s. So, 6e4 is 0.2 times the speed of light. So v = 0.2c.

So, beta is 0.2, and beta = v/c.

Gamma would be 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1/sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.0206. So, gamma is approximately 1.0206.

So if 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy frame would measure t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 * 50 ≈ 51.03 seconds.

Wait, but wait. Is that correct? Because in the ejecta frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it. So, perhaps the time in the Galaxy frame is longer. Wait, no, I think in this case, since the events are happening at the same place in the ejecta's frame, the time in the galaxy frame would be longer. So yes, t = gamma * t' ≈ 51.03 seconds.

Wait, but wait another thing. Alternatively, maybe I should think about it from the galaxy's perspective. From the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So, the distance the ejecta travels would be speed multiplied by time. But the time is not 50 seconds. It's the time as measured in the galaxy's frame.

Wait, so perhaps the problem is that the 50 seconds is the proper time (t') experienced by the ejecta. So, the time in the galaxy's frame is longer, so t = gamma * t'.

So, time in galaxy frame is 50 * gamma ≈ 50 * 1.0206 ≈ 51.03 seconds.

Then, the distance would be speed (v) multiplied by time (t), right? So, distance = v * t.

v is 60,000 km/s. So, 6e4 km/s * 51.03 s.

Wait, no. Wait, actually, no. Because the time in the galaxy's frame is longer, but the speed is in the galaxy's frame. So, the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame is v * t. But let me think about units.

Wait, 60,000 km/s is 6e4 km/s. Multiply by 51.03 seconds. So 6e4 * 51.03 = 3,061,800 km.

Wait, looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. So that's close. But let me do the calculation more accurately.

Wait, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.2^2) = 1/sqrt(0.96) = approx 1.02062078.

So, 50 * 1.02062078 = 51.031039 seconds.

Multiply 6e4 km/s by 51.031039 s: 60,000 * 51.031039 = 60,000 *51 is 3,060,000. But wait, 0.031039 *60,000 = 1,862.34 km. So total is 3,060,000 + 1,862.34 ≈ 3,061,862 km. But none of the options exactly match that.

Looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km, which is very close. But perhaps I made a mistake in the way I applied the time dilation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the time in the galaxy's frame is the same as the proper time, but that doesn't make sense. Hmm.

Wait, no, in the ejecta's frame, the events (start and end) are at the same place (the ejecta's position), so the time in that frame is the proper time, t'. The time in the galaxy's frame would be longer, so t = gamma * t'.

So, t = t' * gamma. So, 50 * gamma.

Wait, but perhaps I should consider length contraction instead. Because the distance between the ejecta and the galaxy's center is a length in the galaxy's frame. From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is approaching, so the distance would be contracted.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

In the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at v = 60,000 km/s. The time that passes in the galaxy's frame is t. So, the distance the ejecta travels is v * t.

But how is t related to the 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame?

Wait, in the ejecta's frame, the time between two events (t') is 50 seconds. The events are: the front of the ejecta is at a certain point, and after 50 seconds, it's another point.

Wait, but in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at v = 60,000 km/s, so the distance between the galaxy's center and the ejecta is decreasing. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the Lorentz transformations to find the time in the galaxy's frame. But I'm not too confident about that.

Alternatively, considering that in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. The proper time (t') is 50 seconds. The time in the galaxy's frame would be longer.

So, t = gamma * t' (since the events are at the same place in the ejecta's frame).

So, t = 50 * gamma ≈ 50 * 1.0206 = 51.03 seconds.

Then, the distance in the galaxy's frame is v * t = 60,000 * 51.03 = 3,061,800 km.

But the options don't have that. The closest is option D: 3,060,000 km. So perhaps the approximation of gamma is better.

Wait, let me calculate gamma more accurately.

Beta is 0.2. So beta squared is 0.04. 1 - beta^2 is 0.96.

The square root of 0.96 is approximately 0.9798. Because 0.9798^2 is approx 0.96.

So gamma is 1/0.9798 ≈ 1.02062078.

So, t = 50 * 1.02062078 = 51.031039 s.

v = 60,000 km/s.

60,000 * 51.031039 = ?

Let me compute this accurately.

50 * 60,000 = 3,000,000.

1.031039 *60,000 = 60,000 *1 =60,000; 60,000 *0.031039 = 1,862.34.

So total is 3,000,000 + 1,862.34 = 3,001,862.34 km.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait wait, no.

Wait, 60,000 km/s * 51.031039 s = 60,000 *51.031039 = 60,000 *51 = 3,060,000, plus 60,000 *0.031039=1,862.34. So 3,061,862.34 km.

But looking at the options, D is 3,060,000 km, which is 3,060,000. The actual calculation gives 3,061,862, which isn't an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Maybe the proper time isn't t', perhaps I should consider the velocity and time from the other frame. Or perhaps the problem is simpler.

Wait, another approach: the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s relative to the galaxy. So, from the galaxy's frame, in 50 seconds (as measured in the galaxy's frame), the ejecta would have moved v * t.

But wait, how much time passes in the galaxy's frame? Because the 50 seconds are in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, no, because in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass. How much time passes in the galaxy's frame? That's where the time dilation comes in. Because in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it, so events that happen in the galaxy (like the time passing) would be dilated.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to find the distance in the galaxy's frame as v multiplied by t, where t is the time in the galaxy's frame.

Wait, but how do I find t?

Wait, in the ejecta's frame, the time is t' =50 s. The galaxy's frame time t is related by the time dilation formula. But what's the relation?

Wait, in the ejecta's frame, the events (start and end of the 50 seconds) are at the same position, so the time in the galaxy's frame is longer. So t = gamma * t'.

So, t = 50 * gamma.

Then, distance in galaxy's frame is v * t = 6e4 km/s * 50 * gamma.

Wait, so that's 6e4 *50 * 1.02062078.

6e4 *50 is 3e6.

3e6 *1.02062078 = 3,061,862.34 km.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I should round to the nearest option.

Looking at the options again:

A) 2,940,000 km.

B) 3,000,000 km.

C) 2,880,000 km.

D) 3,060,000 km.

So, the closest is D, which is 3,060,000 km. Our calculated value is approximately 3,061,862 km, which is 3.06 million, so D is very close.

Wait, but why is the option D 3,060,000 km? Maybe because the problem expects us to use an approximate value for gamma.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is simply using the velocity multiplied by the time in the ejecta's frame, but that wouldn't account for time dilation, which might not be intended.

Wait, if we ignore relativity and just do v*t, then 60,000 km/s *50 s = 3,000,000 km. That's option B. But that's incorrect because the problem says to consider the frames as inertial, which implies we should use relativity.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the direction of time dilation. Because from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is approaching. So, in the galaxy's frame, the time would be longer, so the distance is greater. But when I calculated, it's about 3.06 million km, which is option D.

So, the correct answer would be D.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the 50 seconds in the ejecta frame are the same as in the galaxy's, which would give 3 million km (option B), but that would be ignoring relativity, so it's likely that the correct approach is the relativistic one.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative motion between the supernova ejecta and the Galaxy, considering special relativity since both frames are inertial and moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light.

### Key Information:
- The ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy at a speed of \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) (or \( 0.2c \)).
- In the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass (\( t' = 50 \, \text{s} \)).
- The goal is to determine the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during this time.

### Relativistic Time Dilation:
Since the events (start and end of the 50-second interval) occur at the same location in the ejecta's frame, the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer due to time dilation. The time dilation factor is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}}, \quad \text{where } \beta = \frac{v}{c}.
\]

Here, \( \beta = 0.2 \), so:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.2^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.0206.
\]

The time in the Galaxy's frame is:

\[
t = \gamma \cdot t' = 1.0206 \cdot 50 \approx 51.03 \, \text{s}.
\]

### Distance Traveled in the Galaxy's Frame:
The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is:

\[
\text{Distance} = v \cdot t.
\]

Substituting \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( t = 51.03 \, \text{s} \):

\[
\text{Distance} = 60,000 \cdot 51.03 \approx 3,061,800 \, \text{km}.
\]

### Comparing with the Options:
The closest option to the calculated value is:

**D) 3,060,000 km.**

### Conclusion:
The relativistic calculation accounts for time dilation, and the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame is approximately \( 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \), matching option D.
