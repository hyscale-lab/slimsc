Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity, and I need to figure out how many of these compounds exhibit it. Hmm, I remember that optical activity has to do with chiral centers and whether a molecule can rotate plane-polarized light. Chiral centers are carbons attached to four different groups, right? So each compound I need to check for that.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene
Wait, the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but wait, butene is four carbons. So the structure is CH2Cl-C(=CH2)-CH2-CH3? Or is it 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, maybe I should draw it.

Wait, but the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. So the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So the molecule is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, but it's but-1-ene, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, but that's a single bond. Oh wait, no. Wait, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So in this case, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would have Cl on C1 (which is double bonded to C2 which has a methyl group). So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(=CH2)-CH(CH3)? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, but that can't be right because the double bond is between 1 and 2, making it CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Wait, if the molecule is (Z) configuration, but that doesn't directly affect chirality. Wait, but wait, can a double bond lead to a chiral center? Wait, no, because the double bond doesn't rotate, but the molecule itself can have symmetry. Let's think: is there any chiral center here? The central carbon (C2) is attached to CH3, CH2Cl, and two CH2 groups? Or maybe it's only attached to three different groups. Wait, the molecule is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? So C2 has Cl (from C1), a methyl group, and double bonded to C3, which is CH2. So the groups around C2 would be Cl (actually, C1 is Cl-CH2-), then C2 is connected to CH(CH3), and then the double bond to C3. Wait, perhaps I'm not seeing it. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but that's a single bond. Oh wait, no, the double bond is between 1 and 2. So perhaps it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, so C1 is CH2Cl double bonded to C2. So C2 is CH(CH3), and then single bonds to C3 and C4.

Wait, but in that case, C2 is connected to: Cl-CH2 (from C1), a methyl group, and two CH2 groups? No, because C2 is CH(CH3), so it's CH2Cl (from C1), a methyl group, and two CH2 groups? Wait, maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So C1: Cl, C2 is CH(CH3), double bonded to C3, which is CH2. So C2 is attached to Cl (but through a single bond, from C1), a methyl group, and two CH2 groups. Wait, no, because C2 is connected to C1 (CH2Cl), two CH3 (wait, no, it's CH(CH3)), so C2 would have: CH2Cl (group 1), CH3 (group 2), CH2- (group 3), and the double bond to C3. Hmm, wait, but wait, if a carbon is double-bonded, then it's only connected to three other groups, not four. So, in that case, the central carbon (C2) is connected via a double bond, so it's not a chiral center because it's only attached to three groups (since double bonds don't count as a substituent in that way). So, does this molecule have any chiral centers? Let me see. The C1 is CH2Cl, but that's attached to another CH2 (double bond), a CH(CH3), and perhaps another CH2. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, perhaps this molecule doesn't have any chiral centers because the central carbon is part of a double bond, so it can't be a chiral center. So no optical activity here.

2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione
Hmm, this sounds complex. Let me try to parse this. It's a hexahydro ring, so a six-membered ring, perhaps fused. The substituents are a chloromethylene group (so a CH2Cl group attached via a double bond?), and a methano group (so a bridge, perhaps). The configuration is given with specific stereodescriptors. The question is, does this compound have a chiral center?

Well, the presence of multiple stereodescriptors (3aR,7aS) suggests that there are chiral centers. The (E) designation refers to the configuration around the double bond, but that doesn't directly affect chirality. However, if the molecule has a bridge structure, it's possible that some of the bridgeheads are chiral centers. For example, in a bicyclic system, bridgehead carbons can be chiral if they have four different substituents. So given that the molecule has (3aR,7aS,E) configurations, these are probably bridgeheads with different substituents. So yes, this compound should have chiral centers and thus be optically active.

3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid
Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. When substituted with methyl groups on C2 and C3, the structure becomes HOOC-C(CH3)H-CH(CH3)-COOH. Let's see the substituents on each carbon. For C2: it's attached to a COOH group (from C1), a CH(CH3) (C3), a methyl group, and a hydrogen. So four different groups? Wait, no. Let me think. Wait, the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH? No, wait the substituents are 2R and 3S. Wait, succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So 2,3-dimethyl would mean each has a methyl group. So structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So both C2 and C3 have a methyl group. Now, for each of these carbons (C2 and C3), what are the substituents?

C2: attached to HOOC (from C1), a CH(CH3) (the C3), a methyl group, and a hydrogen. So the four groups are: COOH (from C1), CH(CH3) (C3), CH3, and H. Are those four different? Wait, COOH is a group, the adjacent C is CH(CH3), which is a CH group with a methyl, a hydrogen, and attached to the next CH(CH3). Wait, that might be a bit confusing. Alternatively, I can list each substituent. For C2: the four substituents are:

- One from C1: the CH2 group (but wait, no, because C1 is the COOH), wait no. Let me think of the structure as:

COOH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Wait, but in the case of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, each of the middle two carbons (C2 and C3) has a methyl group. So C2 is CH(CH3), and C3 is CH(CH3). Now, looking at C2: the groups are:

- CH2COOH (from C1, which is a CH2 attached to a COOH group? No, wait, C1 is the first carbon with the COOH, so C2 is the second. So C2 is connected to C1 (which is a COOH), C3 (which is CH(CH3)), and has two substituents: a methyl group and a hydrogen. So for C2, the substituents are:

- COOH (from C1) as a group (but wait, C2 is bonded to C1, which is the first carbon with COOH. Wait, maybe it's better to think of the structure as HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Then C2 is CH(CH3), so the substituents are:

- The adjacent carbons (C1 and C3), which are both CH groups, each with their own substituents.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think of each chiral center. For C2 in (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, the substituents would be:

- COOH (from C1),
- CH(CH3) (from C3),
- CH3 (the methyl group on C2),
- and a hydrogen.

So four different groups: COOH (as a substituent, but wait, no, the substituent is the adjacent carbon. Wait, no. The substituents on C2 are:

- The group from C1: which is a CH2 group (but wait, C1 is the first carbon, so C2 is attached to C1 which is a CH2COOH? No, wait, no, C1 is COOH, so C2 is attached to C1 (which is COOH-CH2-). Wait, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps I should just note that both C2 and C3 have four different substituents, making them chiral centers. So this molecule has two chiral centers, so it's optically active. So yes, this compound is chiral.

4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid
This is similar to the previous compound, but with both R configurations. So the structure is the same: 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Again, C2 and C3 each have four different substituents, so they are chiral centers. So this compound is also optically active.

Wait, but wait a second. If both C2 and C3 are R, could there be an internal plane of symmetry making the molecule achiral? For example, if the molecule is a meso compound. In the case of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, if the configurations are both R or both S, does that make the molecule achiral? Let me think: in a molecule like tartaric acid, if both chiral centers are R or both S, it's a meso compound (due to a plane of symmetry), making it achiral. So in the case of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, if the configurations are R,R or S,S, it's a meso compound. But wait, is succinic acid a meso compound when both substituents are the same configuration?

Wait, no. Wait, in the case of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, if the substituents are both R or both S, is there a plane of symmetry? Let me imagine the structure: HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So if C2 is R and C3 is R, then perhaps there's a plane of symmetry between the two centers. So the molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the middle, making it a meso compound. So in that case, the molecule is achiral and not optically active.

Wait, but wait, in the previous compound (number 3), it's (2R,3S), which would not have a plane of symmetry. So that compound is chiral and optically active. In this case (number 4), (2R,3R), it would have a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound, which is achiral. So this compound would not exhibit optical activity.

Hmm, that's an important point. So the first 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid (3) is chiral, but the second (4) is a meso compound and thus not chiral.

5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol
Cyclohex-3-en-1-ol is a cyclohexene ring with an OH group on C1 and a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, but without substituents, can this molecule have a chiral center?

Wait, the OH is on C1, which is attached to the ring. Let's see: The structure is a six-membered ring, with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an OH on C1. So, the structure would have each carbon in the ring attached to two other carbons in the ring, plus the substituents. So for C1, which has the OH, let's see what substituents it has. C1 is connected to C6 and C2 (ring carbons), and the OH group. So, substituents on C1 would be: two ring CH2 groups (from C2 and C6), the OH, and maybe another CH group from C3? Wait, but in a cyclohexene, the ring is not all single bonds; there's a double bond.

Wait, more accurately, cyclohex-3-en-1-ol would have the double bond between C3 and C4, and the OH on C1. So, the ring is as follows: C1-OH, connected to C2, which is connected to C3 (double bond to C4), then C5 and C6, and back to C1. So C1 has two adjacent carbons: C2 and C6. So the substituents on C1 are: OH, two CH groups (from C2 and C6), and the ring. Wait, but in a cyclic structure, each carbon is bonded to two others in the ring, plus two other substituents (or maybe one if it's a bridge). So C1 in this case has substituents: OH, two CH2 groups (C2 and C6), and a CH group from C3? No, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that C1 is attached to C2 and C6, the OH group, and maybe a hydrogen. Wait, no, in a cyclohexene ring, each carbon in the ring is bonded to two other ring carbons, plus two other substituents. For C1, substituents are: OH, and two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6), and a hydrogen? Or perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are the ring (two bonds), the OH, and two other substituents.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about each carbon in the ring. For C1, substituents would be: OH, two CH groups (from C2 and C6), and a CH2 group from where? Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps C1 is bonded to two other ring carbons, the OH, and a hydrogen. But that would make it CH2OH, which isn't the case. Wait, no. In cyclohexanol, the structure is a cyclohexane ring with an OH on one carbon, so each ring carbon is bonded to two others, plus some substituents. So for C1 in cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, it's attached to two ring carbons (C2 and C6), an OH, and perhaps a hydrogen. So the substituents are: OH, H, and two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6, which are each connected to other carbons). Wait, but in that case, C1 would have two CH2 groups, an OH, and a hydrogen. So four different groups: H, OH, and two CH2 groups (which are each attached to different parts of the ring but same as each other? Or are those CH2 groups the same?

Wait, if the ring is symmetric, then the two substituents (from C2 and C6) might be identical. For example, if the ring is symmetric, the substituents from C2 and C6 could be the same. So at C1, we have OH, H, and two identical CH2 groups. That would make the substituents on C1 not all different, so it wouldn't be a chiral center.

But wait, in this case, the ring has a double bond. So the ring is not symmetric. Let me think: the ring is cyclohexene with a double bond at 3,4. So the double bond affects the structure, making the ring less symmetric. So perhaps C2 and C6 are not identical in their substituents. Let's see: the ring is C1 (OH), C2, C3 (double bond to C4), C4 (double bond to C3), C5, C6 (back to C1). So for C1, the substituents are OH, C2, C6, and H. If C2 and C6 are different because the double bond breaks the symmetry, then C1 would have four distinct substituents: OH, H, and two different CH groups (since C2 is next to C3 and the double bond, while C6 is next to C5, which is not part of the double bond). That would make C1 a chiral center, so the molecule would be optically active.

But wait, is that the case? Let me imagine the structure. The double bond is between C3 and C4, so the ring has a transannular double bond. Because of this, the substituents on C1 (C2 and C6) would be different, leading to C1 being a chiral center. So this compound is chiral and optically active.

6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol
This is a cyclohexane ring with hydroxyl groups on C1, C3, and C5. Let's imagine the structure. The substituents are on alternate carbons. So, C1, C3, C5 each have an OH group, and the others are CH2.

Now, does this molecule have a plane of symmetry? Let's see. If all three OH groups are on the same face (cis), then maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. But the question is about whether any of the carbons are chiral centers.

Each OH-bearing carbon (C1, C3, C5) is connected to three other ring carbons (since it's a six-membered ring) and the OH group. Wait, each carbon in a cyclohexane ring is bonded to two adjacent carbons and two other substituents. So for C1, the substituents are two adjacent CH2 groups (or other groups), and the OH. Wait, no, each ring carbon is connected to two adjacent ring carbons and two substituents. So, in this case, C1 is connected to C2 and C6 (ring carbons), and has an OH group and a CH2 group (if the adjacent carbons are CH2). Wait, no, because in cyclohexane, each carbon is CH2. But in this case, the OH groups are on C1, C3, C5, so those carbons would be CH(OH), and the others are CH2.

So for C1: substituents are OH, two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6), and another CH2 (from the ring? No, wait, perhaps the substituents on C1 are OH, two CH2 groups, and a hydrogen? No, because in a ring, each carbon is connected to two other carbons and two substituents. So for C1, substituents would be two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6), OH, and a hydrogen. So four different groups: OH, H, and two identical CH2 groups. Wait, but if the ring is unsymmetrical, the CH2 groups attached to C1 (from C2 and C6) might not be identical. Wait, because the ring has OH groups on C1, C3, C5, the substituents around C1 could be different from those around C3 and C5. But in this case, each of the OH-bearing carbons (C1, C3, C5) would have substituents that are two CH2 groups and an OH. Are those CH2 groups identical? Because C2 is next to C3 (which has an OH), and C6 is next to C5 (which has an OH), so the substituents on C1 (from C2 and C6) are both CH2 groups but attached to different parts of the ring.

Wait, but if the substituents are two different CH2 groups (each attached to different positions), then C1 would have four different substituents: OH, H, CH2-C3-OH, and CH2-C5-OH. Wait, no, because C2 is connected to C3, which has an OH. So the substituent for C1 from C2 is a CH2-OH (no, C2 is CH2, and C3 is OH. So perhaps C2 is CH2 connected to C3 (which is OH). So for C1, the substituent from C2 is a CH2 group, and from C6 is a CH2 group, but these CH2 groups are connected to different parts of the ring. So the substituents on C1 would be: OH, H, CH2-C2, and CH2-C6. Are these two CH2 groups identical?

If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, maybe the substituents are the same. But let's think about the configuration: (1s,3s,5s). So all three OH groups are on the same side (if it's a chair conformation, all axial or all equatorial). Wait, but if the substituents are all axial, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has no plane of symmetry because the OH groups are on three different carbons.

Wait, but regardless of configuration, each of the OH-bearing carbons (C1, C3, C5) would have substituents that might make them chiral centers. Let's analyze C1: substituents are OH, two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6), and a hydrogen. If the substituents from C2 and C6 are different (because their adjacent carbons have OH groups), then C1 would have four different substituents, making it a chiral center. Similarly, C3 and C5 would each have four different substituents and thus be chiral centers.

But wait, that can't be right because having three chiral centers would lead to a lot of optical activity, but maybe the molecule as a whole has a plane of symmetry. If the three OH groups are arranged symmetrically, maybe the molecule is achiral. For example, if the substituents on C1, C3, and C5 are arranged such that the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image, it wouldn't be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a center of inversion. If the molecule is symmetric in such a way, it would be achiral. For instance, if you have three OH groups in a symmetric pattern, like at 120-degree intervals, perhaps the molecule is achiral.

Wait, but let me think about the structure. If the three OH groups are on C1, C3, and C5, and each of those is a chiral center, then the molecule would have three chiral centers, but perhaps the entire molecule is not chiral because it has a plane of symmetry. For example, if the molecule is symmetric across a plane, then it's a meso compound and not chiral. Alternatively, maybe each OH group is on a chiral center, but the overall molecule is not chiral because of symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps each of the three OH-bearing carbons is a chiral center, but the molecule as a whole is not chiral because it has a plane of symmetry. For example, in a situation where the substituents on each chiral center are arranged symmetrically, the molecule could be achiral. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because there's no plane of symmetry, despite having three chiral centers.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky. Alternatively, perhaps each of these carbons is a chiral center, making the molecule chiral.

But wait, let's think about a simpler case. Take cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. If all three OH groups are on the same face, then each of the three carbons (C1, C3, C5) would have four different substituents, making them chiral centers. But the molecule as a whole might not be chiral because it has a plane of symmetry. For example, if you mirror the molecule across the plane that bisects through the ring, it would look the same. So if the molecule is symmetric, it's a meso compound and thus not chiral.

So, in the given case, (1s,3s,5s), would the molecule be chiral or not? If all three substituents are in R configuration, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. So the molecule would be achiral, and thus not exhibit optical activity.

Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a way that there's no symmetry, the molecule would be chiral. But I think in this case, the molecule has three substituents arranged symmetrically, making it a meso compound. So this compound would not exhibit optical activity.

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one
The structure is a cyclopentyl group attached to C1, a ketone group (butan-1-one) on C1, and a methyl group on C3. So the structure is:

Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no. Wait, butan-1-one is (CH3)2CO, but with additional substituents. Let me structure it as:

O=C-(CH2)3-CH(CH3)

But wait, no. 1-ketobutane is (CH3)3C-CO-CH3? No, butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CO-CH3. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong, let me think again. Butan-1-one is (CH2CH2CH2)COCH3? No, butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CO-CH3? Wait, no, butan-1-one is (CH2)3-C=O. So the structure is CH2CH2CH2-C=O.

Wait, but in this case, the substituent is 1-cyclopentyl, so the carbonyl is attached to the cyclopentyl group. So the structure is:

Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, but the substituent is 3-methyl, so a methyl group on C3 of butanone.

Wait, butan-1-one is (CH2)3-C=O. So with substituents, the structure is:

Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the structure is:

O=C-(cyclopentyl)-(CH2)2-CH(CH3).

So the carbonyl is on C1, which is attached to a cyclopentyl group and a CH2CH(CH3)CH2 group.

In any case, let's look for chiral centers. The carbonyl group is on C1, which is connected to the cyclopentyl group and a CH2 chain. The other carbons would be in the chain. Let's focus on C3, which has a methyl group. So, C3's structure would be CH(CH3). What are the substituents on C3?

C3 is connected to C2 (which is CH2-C=O), C4 (CH2-...), and a methyl group. Let me see:

- C3: attached to C2 (CH2-C=O), C4 (CH2-CH2-...), and a methyl group, plus another hydrogen. So substituents are: CH2-C=O, CH2-CH2..., CH3, and H. Are those four different groups? Yes. So C3 is a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule has a chiral center and is optically active.

So to recap each compound:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No chiral centers. Not optically active. So no.
2. (3aR,7aS,E)-...: Yes, has chiral centers. Optically active. Yes.
3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Two chiral centers, not a meso compound. Optically active. Yes.
4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Meso compound, so not chiral. No optical activity.
5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: C1 is a chiral center. Optically active. Yes.
6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Meso compound, not chiral. No.
7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: C3 is a chiral center. Optically active. Yes.

So how many are optically active? Let's count:

Compounds 2, 3,5,7 are active. That's four. Wait, wait—did I get that right?

Wait:

1. No → 0
2. Yes → 1
3. Yes → 2
4. No → 2
5. Yes → 3
6. No →3
7. Yes →4

Wait, that's four compounds: 2,3,5,7. So that's four, right? So the total is four.

Wait, but let's double-check. Did I miss any?

Wait, wait, number 6: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. Earlier, I thought it's a meso compound, so not chiral. So that's correct, no optical activity.

So four compounds: 2,3,5,7 are optically active.

Wait, but looking back, the options given are:

A)5

B)3

C)2

D)4

So the correct answer would be D)4.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality, which requires at least one chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). Optical activity arises when a compound has chirality and no internal plane of symmetry (e.g., meso compounds are achiral despite having chiral centers).

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**  
   The molecule has a double bond between C1 and C2, and the central carbon (C2) is bonded to a methyl group, a hydrogen, and two identical CH2 groups. Since C2 is not bonded to four different groups, it is not a chiral center. This compound is **not optically active**.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**  
   This complex bicyclic compound has stereodescriptors (3aR, 7aS) indicating chiral centers at the bridgehead carbons. These carbons are bonded to four different groups, making them chiral. This compound is **optically active**.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   The molecule has two chiral centers at C2 and C3. Each carbon is bonded to four different groups: C2 is bonded to a carboxylic acid, a methyl group, a hydrogen, and the adjacent carbon; C3 is bonded to a carboxylic acid, a methyl group, a hydrogen, and the adjacent carbon. Since the configurations are (2R,3S), the molecule is not a meso compound and is **optically active**.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   This compound is also 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, but with both chiral centers in the R configuration. Due to the plane of symmetry between C2 and C3, this molecule is a meso compound and is **not optically active**.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**  
   The hydroxyl group on C1 creates a chiral center. C1 is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen, an OH group, and two distinct CH2 groups from the cyclohexene ring. This compound is **optically active**.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**  
   This molecule has hydroxyl groups on C1, C3, and C5. Each of these carbons is bonded to four different groups, making them chiral centers. However, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound and **not optically active**.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**  
   The methyl group on C3 creates a chiral center. C3 is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen, a CH2 group, a methyl group, and the cyclopentyl-substituted ketone group. This compound is **optically active**.

### Conclusion:
The compounds that exhibit optical activity are:  
2, 3, 5, and 7.  
This totals to **4 optically active compounds**.

ANSWER: D

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity, and I need to figure out how many of these compounds exhibit it. Hmm, I remember that optical activity has to do with chiral centers and whether a molecule can rotate plane-polarized light. Chiral centers are carbons attached to four different groups, right? So each compound I need to check for that.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene
Wait, the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but wait, butene is four carbons. So the structure is CH2Cl-C(=CH2)-CH2-CH3? Or is it 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, maybe I should draw it.

Wait, but the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. So the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So the molecule is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, but it's but-1-ene, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, but that's a single bond. Oh wait, no. Wait, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So in this case, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would have Cl on C1 (which is double bonded to C2 which has a methyl group). So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(=CH2)-CH(CH3)? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, but that can't be right because the double bond is between 1 and 2, making it CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Wait, if the molecule is (Z) configuration, but that doesn't directly affect chirality. Wait, but wait, can a double bond lead to a chiral center? Wait, no, because the double bond doesn't rotate, but the molecule itself can have symmetry. Let's think: is there any chiral center here? The central carbon (C2) is attached to CH3, CH2Cl, and two CH2 groups? Or maybe it's only attached to three different groups. Wait, the molecule is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? So C2 has Cl (from C1), a methyl group, and double bonded to C3, which is CH2. So the groups around C2 would be Cl (actually, C1 is Cl-CH2-), then C2 is connected to CH(CH3), and then the double bond to C3. Wait, perhaps I'm not seeing it. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but that's a single bond. Oh wait, no, the double bond is between 1 and 2. So perhaps it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, so C1 is CH2Cl double bonded to C2. So C2 is CH(CH3), and then single bonds to C3 and C4.

Wait, but in that case, C2 is connected to: Cl-CH2 (from C1), a methyl group, and two CH2 groups? No, because C2 is CH(CH3), so it's CH2Cl (from C1), a methyl group, and two CH2 groups? Wait, maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So C1: Cl, C2 is CH(CH3), double bonded to C3, which is CH2. So C2 is attached to Cl (but through a single bond, from C1), a methyl group, and two CH2 groups. Wait, no, because C2 is connected to C1 (CH2Cl), two CH3 (wait, no, it's CH(CH3)), so C2 would have: CH2Cl (group 1), CH3 (group 2), CH2- (group 3), and the double bond to C3. Hmm, wait, but wait, if a carbon is double-bonded, then it's only connected to three other groups, not four. So, in that case, the central carbon (C2) is connected via a double bond, so it's not a chiral center because it's only attached to three groups (since double bonds don't count as a substituent in that way). So, does this molecule have any chiral centers? Let me see. The C1 is CH2Cl, but that's attached to another CH2 (double bond), a CH(CH3), and perhaps another CH2. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, perhaps this molecule doesn't have any chiral centers because the central carbon is part of a double bond, so it can't be a chiral center. So no optical activity here.

2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione
Hmm, this sounds complex. Let me try to parse this. It's a hexahydro ring, so a six-membered ring, perhaps fused. The substituents are a chloromethylene group (so a CH2Cl group attached via a double bond?), and a methano group (so a bridge, perhaps). The configuration is given with specific stereodescriptors. The question is, does this compound have a chiral center?

Well, the presence of multiple stereodescriptors (3aR,7aS) suggests that there are chiral centers. The (E) designation refers to the configuration around the double bond, but that doesn't directly affect chirality. However, if the molecule has a bridge structure, it's possible that some of the bridgeheads are chiral centers. For example, in a bicyclic system, bridgehead carbons can be chiral if they have four different substituents. So given that the molecule has (3aR,7aS,E) configurations, these are probably bridgeheads with different substituents. So yes, this compound should have chiral centers and thus be optically active.

3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid
Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. When substituted with methyl groups on C2 and C3, the structure becomes HOOC-C(CH3)H-CH(CH3)-COOH. Let's see the substituents on each carbon. For C2: it's attached to a COOH group (from C1), a CH(CH3) (C3), a methyl group, and a hydrogen. So four different groups? Wait, no. Let me think. Wait, the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH? No, wait the substituents are 2R and 3S. Wait, succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So 2,3-dimethyl would mean each has a methyl group. So structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So both C2 and C3 have a methyl group. Now, for each of these carbons (C2 and C3), what are the substituents?

C2: attached to HOOC (from C1), a CH(CH3) (the C3), a methyl group, and a hydrogen. So the four groups are: COOH (from C1), CH(CH3) (C3), CH3, and H. Are those four different? Wait, COOH is a group, the adjacent C is CH(CH3), which is a CH group with a methyl, a hydrogen, and attached to the next CH(CH3). Wait, that might be a bit confusing. Alternatively, I can list each substituent. For C2: the four substituents are:

- One from C1: the CH2 group (but wait, no, because C1 is the COOH), wait no. Let me think of the structure as:

COOH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Wait, but in the case of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, each of the middle two carbons (C2 and C3) has a methyl group. So C2 is CH(CH3), and C3 is CH(CH3). Now, looking at C2: the groups are:

- CH2COOH (from C1, which is a CH2 attached to a COOH group? No, wait, C1 is the first carbon with the COOH, so C2 is the second. So C2 is connected to C1 (which is a COOH), C3 (which is CH(CH3)), and has two substituents: a methyl group and a hydrogen. So for C2, the substituents are:

- COOH (from C1) as a group (but wait, C2 is bonded to C1, which is the first carbon with COOH. Wait, maybe it's better to think of the structure as HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Then C2 is CH(CH3), so the substituents are:

- The adjacent carbons (C1 and C3), which are both CH groups, each with their own substituents.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think of each chiral center. For C2 in (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, the substituents would be:

- COOH (from C1),
- CH(CH3) (from C3),
- CH3 (the methyl group on C2),
- and a hydrogen.

So four different groups: COOH (as a substituent, but wait, no, the substituent is the adjacent carbon. Wait, no. The substituents on C2 are:

- The group from C1: which is a CH2 group (but wait, C1 is the first carbon, so C2 is attached to C1 which is a CH2COOH? No, wait, no, C1 is COOH, so C2 is attached to C1 (which is COOH-CH2-). Wait, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps I should just note that both C2 and C3 have four different substituents, making them chiral centers. So this molecule has two chiral centers, so it's optically active. So yes, this compound is chiral.

4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid
This is similar to the previous compound, but with both R configurations. So the structure is the same: 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Again, C2 and C3 each have four different substituents, so they are chiral centers. So this compound is also optically active.

Wait, but wait a second. If both C2 and C3 are R, could there be an internal plane of symmetry making the molecule achiral? For example, if the molecule is a meso compound. In the case of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, if the configurations are both R or both S, does that make the molecule achiral? Let me think: in a molecule like tartaric acid, if both chiral centers are R or both S, it's a meso compound (due to a plane of symmetry), making it achiral. So in the case of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, if the configurations are R,R or S,S, it's a meso compound. But wait, is succinic acid a meso compound when both substituents are the same configuration?

Wait, no. Wait, in the case of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, if the substituents are both R or both S, is there a plane of symmetry? Let me imagine the structure: HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So if C2 is R and C3 is R, then perhaps there's a plane of symmetry between the two centers. So the molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the middle, making it a meso compound. So in that case, the molecule is achiral and not optically active.

Wait, but wait, in the previous compound (number 3), it's (2R,3S), which would not have a plane of symmetry. So that compound is chiral and optically active. In this case (number 4), (2R,3R), it would have a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound, which is achiral. So this compound would not exhibit optical activity.

Hmm, that's an important point. So the first 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid (3) is chiral, but the second (4) is a meso compound and thus not chiral.

5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol
Cyclohex-3-en-1-ol is a cyclohexene ring with an OH group on C1 and a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, but without substituents, can this molecule have a chiral center?

Wait, the OH is on C1, which is attached to the ring. Let's see: The structure is a six-membered ring, with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an OH on C1. So, the structure would have each carbon in the ring attached to two other carbons in the ring, plus the substituents. So for C1, which has the OH, let's see what substituents it has. C1 is connected to C6 and C2 (ring carbons), and the OH group. So, substituents on C1 would be: two ring CH2 groups (from C2 and C6), the OH, and maybe another CH group from C3? Wait, but in a cyclohexene, the ring is not all single bonds; there's a double bond.

Wait, more accurately, cyclohex-3-en-1-ol would have the double bond between C3 and C4, and the OH on C1. So, the ring is as follows: C1-OH, connected to C2, which is connected to C3 (double bond to C4), then C5 and C6, and back to C1. So C1 has two adjacent carbons: C2 and C6. So the substituents on C1 are: OH, two CH groups (from C2 and C6), and the ring. Wait, but in a cyclic structure, each carbon is bonded to two others in the ring, plus two other substituents (or maybe one if it's a bridge). So C1 in this case has substituents: OH, two CH2 groups (C2 and C6), and a CH group from C3? No, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that C1 is attached to C2 and C6, the OH group, and maybe a hydrogen. Wait, no, in a cyclohexene ring, each carbon in the ring is bonded to two other ring carbons, plus two other substituents. For C1, substituents are: OH, and two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6), and a hydrogen? Or perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are the ring (two bonds), the OH, and two other substituents.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about each carbon in the ring. For C1, substituents would be: OH, two CH groups (from C2 and C6), and a CH2 group from where? Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps C1 is bonded to two other ring carbons, the OH, and a hydrogen. But that would make it CH2OH, which isn't the case. Wait, no. In cyclohexanol, the structure is a cyclohexane ring with an OH on one carbon, so each ring carbon is bonded to two others, plus some substituents. So for C1 in cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, it's attached to two ring carbons (C2 and C6), an OH, and perhaps a hydrogen. So the substituents are: OH, H, and two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6, which are each connected to other carbons). Wait, but in that case, C1 would have two CH2 groups, an OH, and a hydrogen. So four different groups: H, OH, and two CH2 groups (which are each attached to different parts of the ring but same as each other? Or are those CH2 groups the same?

Wait, if the ring is symmetric, then the two substituents (from C2 and C6) might be identical. For example, if the ring is symmetric, the substituents from C2 and C6 could be the same. So at C1, we have OH, H, and two identical CH2 groups. That would make the substituents on C1 not all different, so it wouldn't be a chiral center.

But wait, in this case, the ring has a double bond. So the ring is not symmetric. Let me think: the ring is cyclohexene with a double bond at 3,4. So the double bond affects the structure, making the ring less symmetric. So perhaps C2 and C6 are not identical in their substituents. Let's see: the ring is C1 (OH), C2, C3 (double bond to C4), C4 (double bond to C3), C5, C6 (back to C1). So for C1, the substituents are OH, C2, C6, and H. If C2 and C6 are different because the double bond breaks the symmetry, then C1 would have four distinct substituents: OH, H, and two different CH groups (since C2 is next to C3 and the double bond, while C6 is next to C5, which is not part of the double bond). That would make C1 a chiral center, so the molecule would be optically active.

But wait, is that the case? Let me imagine the structure. The double bond is between C3 and C4, so the ring has a transannular double bond. Because of this, the substituents on C1 (C2 and C6) would be different, leading to C1 being a chiral center. So this compound is chiral and optically active.

6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol
This is a cyclohexane ring with hydroxyl groups on C1, C3, and C5. Let's imagine the structure. The substituents are on alternate carbons. So, C1, C3, C5 each have an OH group, and the others are CH2.

Now, does this molecule have a plane of symmetry? Let's see. If all three OH groups are on the same face (cis), then maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. But the question is about whether any of the carbons are chiral centers.

Each OH-bearing carbon (C1, C3, C5) is connected to three other ring carbons (since it's a six-membered ring) and the OH group. Wait, each carbon in a cyclohexane ring is bonded to two adjacent carbons and two other substituents. So for C1, the substituents are two adjacent CH2 groups (or other groups), and the OH. Wait, no, each ring carbon is connected to two adjacent ring carbons and two substituents. So, in this case, C1 is connected to C2 and C6 (ring carbons), and has an OH group and a CH2 group (if the adjacent carbons are CH2). Wait, no, because in cyclohexane, each carbon is CH2. But in this case, the OH groups are on C1, C3, C5, so those carbons would be CH(OH), and the others are CH2.

So for C1: substituents are OH, two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6), and another CH2 (from the ring? No, wait, perhaps the substituents on C1 are OH, two CH2 groups, and a hydrogen? No, because in a ring, each carbon is connected to two other carbons and two substituents. So for C1, substituents would be two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6), OH, and a hydrogen. So four different groups: OH, H, and two identical CH2 groups. Wait, but if the ring is unsymmetrical, the CH2 groups attached to C1 (from C2 and C6) might not be identical. Wait, because the ring has OH groups on C1, C3, C5, the substituents around C1 could be different from those around C3 and C5. But in this case, each of the OH-bearing carbons (C1, C3, C5) would have substituents that are two CH2 groups and an OH. Are those CH2 groups identical? Because C2 is next to C3 (which has an OH), and C6 is next to C5 (which has an OH), so the substituents on C1 (from C2 and C6) are both CH2 groups but attached to different parts of the ring.

Wait, but if the substituents are two different CH2 groups (each attached to different positions), then C1 would have four different substituents: OH, H, CH2-C3-OH, and CH2-C5-OH. Wait, no, because C2 is connected to C3, which has an OH. So the substituent for C1 from C2 is a CH2-OH (no, C2 is CH2, and C3 is OH. So perhaps C2 is CH2 connected to C3 (which is OH). So for C1, the substituent from C2 is a CH2 group, and from C6 is a CH2 group, but these CH2 groups are connected to different parts of the ring. So the substituents on C1 would be: OH, H, CH2-C2, and CH2-C6. Are these two CH2 groups identical?

If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, maybe the substituents are the same. But let's think about the configuration: (1s,3s,5s). So all three OH groups are on the same side (if it's a chair conformation, all axial or all equatorial). Wait, but if the substituents are all axial, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has no plane of symmetry because the OH groups are on three different carbons.

Wait, but regardless of configuration, each of the OH-bearing carbons (C1, C3, C5) would have substituents that might make them chiral centers. Let's analyze C1: substituents are OH, two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6), and a hydrogen. If the substituents from C2 and C6 are different (because their adjacent carbons have OH groups), then C1 would have four different substituents, making it a chiral center. Similarly, C3 and C5 would each have four different substituents and thus be chiral centers.

But wait, that can't be right because having three chiral centers would lead to a lot of optical activity, but maybe the molecule as a whole has a plane of symmetry. If the three OH groups are arranged symmetrically, maybe the molecule is achiral. For example, if the substituents on C1, C3, and C5 are arranged such that the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image, it wouldn't be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a center of inversion. If the molecule is symmetric in such a way, it would be achiral. For instance, if you have three OH groups in a symmetric pattern, like at 120-degree intervals, perhaps the molecule is achiral.

Wait, but let me think about the structure. If the three OH groups are on C1, C3, and C5, and each of those is a chiral center, then the molecule would have three chiral centers, but perhaps the entire molecule is not chiral because it has a plane of symmetry. For example, if the molecule is symmetric across a plane, then it's a meso compound and not chiral. Alternatively, maybe each OH group is on a chiral center, but the overall molecule is not chiral because of symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps each of the three OH-bearing carbons is a chiral center, but the molecule as a whole is not chiral because it has a plane of symmetry. For example, in a situation where the substituents on each chiral center are arranged symmetrically, the molecule could be achiral. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because there's no plane of symmetry, despite having three chiral centers.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky. Alternatively, perhaps each of these carbons is a chiral center, making the molecule chiral.

But wait, let's think about a simpler case. Take cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. If all three OH groups are on the same face, then each of the three carbons (C1, C3, C5) would have four different substituents, making them chiral centers. But the molecule as a whole might not be chiral because it has a plane of symmetry. For example, if you mirror the molecule across the plane that bisects through the ring, it would look the same. So if the molecule is symmetric, it's a meso compound and thus not chiral.

So, in the given case, (1s,3s,5s), would the molecule be chiral or not? If all three substituents are in R configuration, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. So the molecule would be achiral, and thus not exhibit optical activity.

Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a way that there's no symmetry, the molecule would be chiral. But I think in this case, the molecule has three substituents arranged symmetrically, making it a meso compound. So this compound would not exhibit optical activity.

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one
The structure is a cyclopentyl group attached to C1, a ketone group (butan-1-one) on C1, and a methyl group on C3. So the structure is:

Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no. Wait, butan-1-one is (CH3)2CO, but with additional substituents. Let me structure it as:

O=C-(CH2)3-CH(CH3)

But wait, no. 1-ketobutane is (CH3)3C-CO-CH3? No, butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CO-CH3. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong, let me think again. Butan-1-one is (CH2CH2CH2)COCH3? No, butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CO-CH3? Wait, no, butan-1-one is (CH2)3-C=O. So the structure is CH2CH2CH2-C=O.

Wait, but in this case, the substituent is 1-cyclopentyl, so the carbonyl is attached to the cyclopentyl group. So the structure is:

Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, but the substituent is 3-methyl, so a methyl group on C3 of butanone.

Wait, butan-1-one is (CH2)3-C=O. So with substituents, the structure is:

Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the structure is:

O=C-(cyclopentyl)-(CH2)2-CH(CH3).

So the carbonyl is on C1, which is attached to a cyclopentyl group and a CH2CH(CH3)CH2 group.

In any case, let's look for chiral centers. The carbonyl group is on C1, which is connected to the cyclopentyl group and a CH2 chain. The other carbons would be in the chain. Let's focus on C3, which has a methyl group. So, C3's structure would be CH(CH3). What are the substituents on C3?

C3 is connected to C2 (which is CH2-C=O), C4 (CH2-...), and a methyl group. Let me see:

- C3: attached to C2 (CH2-C=O), C4 (CH2-CH2-...), and a methyl group, plus another hydrogen. So substituents are: CH2-C=O, CH2-CH2..., CH3, and H. Are those four different groups? Yes. So C3 is a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule has a chiral center and is optically active.

So to recap each compound:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No chiral centers. Not optically active. So no.
2. (3aR,7aS,E)-...: Yes, has chiral centers. Optically active. Yes.
3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Two chiral centers, not a meso compound. Optically active. Yes.
4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Meso compound, so not chiral. No optical activity.
5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: C1 is a chiral center. Optically active. Yes.
6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Meso compound, not chiral. No.
7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: C3 is a chiral center. Optically active. Yes.

So how many are optically active? Let's count:

Compounds 2, 3,5,7 are active. That's four. Wait, wait—did I get that right?

Wait:

1. No → 0
2. Yes → 1
3. Yes → 2
4. No → 2
5. Yes → 3
6. No →3
7. Yes →4

Wait, that's four compounds: 2,3,5,7. So that's four, right? So the total is four.

Wait, but let's double-check. Did I miss any?

Wait, wait, number 6: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. Earlier, I thought it's a meso compound, so not chiral. So that's correct, no optical activity.

So four compounds: 2,3,5,7 are optically active.

Wait, but looking back, the options given are:

A)5

B)3

C)2

D)4

So the correct answer would be D)4.


To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality, which requires at least one chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). Optical activity arises when a compound has chirality and no internal plane of symmetry (e.g., meso compounds are achiral despite having chiral centers).

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**  
   The molecule has a double bond between C1 and C2, and the central carbon (C2) is bonded to a methyl group, a hydrogen, and two identical CH2 groups. Since C2 is not bonded to four different groups, it is not a chiral center. This compound is **not optically active**.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**  
   This complex bicyclic compound has stereodescriptors (3aR, 7aS) indicating chiral centers at the bridgehead carbons. These carbons are bonded to four different groups, making them chiral. This compound is **optically active**.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   The molecule has two chiral centers at C2 and C3. Each carbon is bonded to four different groups: C2 is bonded to a carboxylic acid, a methyl group, a hydrogen, and the adjacent carbon; C3 is bonded to a carboxylic acid, a methyl group, a hydrogen, and the adjacent carbon. Since the configurations are (2R,3S), the molecule is not a meso compound and is **optically active**.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   This compound is also 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, but with both chiral centers in the R configuration. Due to the plane of symmetry between C2 and C3, this molecule is a meso compound and is **not optically active**.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**  
   The hydroxyl group on C1 creates a chiral center. C1 is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen, an OH group, and two distinct CH2 groups from the cyclohexene ring. This compound is **optically active**.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**  
   This molecule has hydroxyl groups on C1, C3, and C5. Each of these carbons is bonded to four different groups, making them chiral centers. However, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound and **not optically active**.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**  
   The methyl group on C3 creates a chiral center. C3 is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen, a CH2 group, a methyl group, and the cyclopentyl-substituted ketone group. This compound is **optically active**.

### Conclusion:
The compounds that exhibit optical activity are:  
2, 3, 5, and 7.  
This totals to **4 optically active compounds**.

ANSWER: D
