Okay, so I've got this physics problem about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but let's try to think this through.

The question asks for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are given, so maybe I can figure it out by considering how particles are filled into energy levels.

Wait, the particles are spin-1/2, so each can have two possible spin states: up or down. That means each energy level can hold two particles, right? Because each state is two-fold degenerate due to spin.

The system is in a 1D infinite potential well of length L. The energy levels for a single particle in such a well are given by E_n = (n² π² ħ²)/(2mL²). Oh wait, the problem states E = π² ħ²/(2mL²), so E_n is n² times E. So E_1 is E, E_2 is 4E, E_3 is 9E, E_4 is 16E, and so on.

Now, we have four particles. Since they're fermions (spin-1/2 implies they're fermions), they obey the Pauli exclusion principle. So each quantum state can hold at most two particles (because of spin up and down).

So let's think about how the particles fill up the energy levels. The ground state would have the lowest possible energy, so we need to fill the lowest energy levels first, each with two particles each, until all four are placed.

Let's list the energy levels:

n=1: E_1 = 1² E = E → can hold 2 particles
n=2: E_2 = 4E → another 2 particles
n=3: E_3=9E → but we only have four particles, so maybe not all filled.

Wait, wait, four particles. So n=1 can hold 2, n=2 holds another 2. So all four would be filled in the n=1 and n=2 levels. So the ground state is when all four are filled in the lowest possible energy states.

Wait but wait, maybe it's not that simple. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again.

Each energy level n has a certain number of states, each with a specific quantum number n and spin up or down. So for each n, there are two possible states (spin up and down), so each n can hold two particles.

So for four particles, let's distribute them across the lowest n's.

Ground state: fill the lowest energy levels first.

n=1: 2 particles (spin up and down)
n=2: 2 particles (spin up and down)
So all four are placed. So the total energy would be 2*E_1 + 2*E_2 = 2*E + 2*4E = 2E +8E=10E.

Wait, but wait a second, the question says "energies of the ground state", etc. So maybe it's the total energy of the system in each state. Hmm.

But the options don't include 10E as the total ground state. Let me look at the options.

Option B's ground state is 4E. Hmm, maybe I misunderstood the question. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the energy of each individual state, not the total. Or wait, no, the question says "energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system". So it's the total energy of the system in each of these states.

Wait, but in the ground state, the particles are all in the lowest possible states. So if each particle is in a state with n=1 and n=2, but wait, no, particles can't all be in n=1 because of spin. Oh, right, each n can have two particles. So n=1 holds two, n=2 holds two. So the ground state total energy is 2*(E) + 2*(4E) = 2E +8E=10E.

Wait, but let me go through the possible states step by step.

Ground state: all four particles are filled in the lowest possible energy levels. So the first two particles go into n=1 (each with opposite spins), and the next two go into n=2 (each with opposite spins). So the total energy is 2E_1 + 2E_2 = 2E + 8E = 10E.

Wait but that would make the ground state energy 10E. Looking at the options, option B says ground state is 4E, and option C says 4E for ground state.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe I should think about each particle's energy and sum them.

Wait, for four particles: two in n=1, two in n=2.

Each in n=1 contributes E_1 = E. So two of them: 2E.

Each in n=2 contributes E_2 =4E. So two of them: 8E.

Total: 2E +8E=10E. So the ground state energy is 10E.

But option B's first option is 4E. Hmm, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I'm not considering the order correctly. Maybe the ground state is when the particles are filled in the lowest possible states, but perhaps each state can have only one particle because of some other constraint? Wait, no, spin-1/2 particles have spin up and down, so each energy level can hold two. So the ground state would have two in n=1 and two in n=2, giving a total of 10E. So which option has ground state as 10E? Let's check.

Option A: 30, 39, 50 → No.

Option B: 4E, 10E, 50E → ground is 4E. Doesn't seem right.

Option C: 4E, 10E, 15E → ground 4E.

Option D: 10E, 15E, 18E → No, ground is 10E.

Wait, wait, but 10E is the ground state in option D. So if that's the case, but let's think about the first excited state.

Wait the question is about the energies of the ground, first excited, and second excited states of the system. So each of these will have a different arrangement of the particles in the energy levels.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the concepts. Let me think again: the ground state is the lowest possible energy, first excited is the next higher energy, and second excited is the next after that.

So let me think about the possible configurations.

In the ground state (lowest energy), the particles are in the lowest possible energy levels. So as before, n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles). So energy is 2*E + 2*4E = 10E.

Now, what's the first excited state? That would be the next lowest energy configuration.

Possibly, it's when one of the particles from n=2 moves to a higher n. But wait, since each n can only hold two particles, maybe the next state is when one particle moves from n=2 to n=3. But wait, can a particle jump multiple levels?

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when the highest occupied n is increased. So, after the ground state (n=1, 2), the first excited state might involve moving one particle from n=2 to n=3, but wait, n=3 can only take two particles. Or maybe all four particles are in the same n=1 and n=2, but that's the ground state.

Wait, no. Maybe the first excited state is when all four particles are in the first two levels, but perhaps the arrangement is different. Hmm, no, that wouldn't be a higher energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, but that would require that n=3 has at least one particle.

Wait, but particles fill the lowest possible states first. So perhaps in the first excited state, the configuration is three particles in n=1 (but that's not possible because each n can only hold two). So that's not allowed.

Wait, maybe the first excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3. Let's see: so in the ground state, n=1 (2) and n=2 (2). In the first excited state, n=1 (2), n=2 (1), and n=3 (1). But wait, can a single particle be in n=3? Because each n can hold two particles, so perhaps that's allowed. So the total energy would be 2*E + 1*4E + 1*9E = 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Wait, but that would make the first excited state 15E. Then the second excited state would be when another particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3 or n=4.

Wait, but let's think about other possibilities. Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle in n=2 is promoted to n=3, so the configuration is n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1).

Wait, but that's only three particles. We have four, so all four must be placed.

Ah, wait, perhaps the first excited state is when the two particles in n=2 are promoted to higher states, but in a way that the total energy is the next possible. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, so the configuration is n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). That would require four particles: 2+1+1=4. So the energy would be 2E + 4E +9E = 15E.

Hmm, but wait, another possibility: perhaps the first excited state is when the two particles in n=2 are promoted to n=3, but that would require four particles in n=3, which can't be because each n can hold two. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, maybe the first excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, and another from n=2 to n=4? Wait, but then the total number of particles would be 2 (n=1) + 1 (n=2) + 1(n=3) + 1(n=4) → that's 5 particles, which is more than four. So that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is moved from n=2 to n=3, and another from n=2 to n=3, but that would require four particles in n=3, which is not allowed (since each n can hold two). So that's impossible.

Wait, maybe another approach: think of the possible energy levels and how the particles fill them beyond the ground state.

Wait, the ground state is when all four are in n=1 and n=2, with 2 each. Then, the first excited state is the next possible arrangement. That would involve moving one of the particles from n=2 to the next available level, which is n=3. But that would require putting one particle in n=3. So the configuration becomes n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). So the energy is 2E + 4E +9E = 15E.

But wait, that's adding 15E, but the ground state was 10E, so 15E is higher than that. But is that the first excited state?

Wait, but maybe there's another possibility where the particles are arranged in a way that the sum of energies is lower than 15E but higher than 10E. Hmm, I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state occurs when all four particles are in the same n=2 level. But wait, each n can only hold two particles, so that's impossible. Because putting four particles in n=2 would require four, but each n can only have two (two spins). So that's not allowed.

So the next possible state after the ground state is when the particles are distributed as n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1), leading to a total energy of 15E. So the first excited state would be 15E.

Wait, but what's the second excited state? That would be the next higher energy after 15E. So perhaps moving another particle from n=2 to n=3, but that's not possible because n=2 only has one particle left. Alternatively, moving the remaining n=2 particle to n=4.

Wait, let's think: in the first excited state, we have n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1), total energy 15E. The second excited state would involve moving the last particle from n=2 to n=4, so the configuration becomes n=1 (2), n=2 (0), n=3 (1), n=4 (1). The energy would be 2E + 0*4E +9E +16E = 2E + 9E +16E = 27E.

Wait, but that's higher than 15E, so perhaps that's the second excited state.

But wait, maybe the second excited state is when both n=2 particles are promoted to higher levels. But that's not possible because each n can take only two. Alternatively, maybe the second excited state is when another particle is promoted from n=3 to a higher level.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider other possibilities. Let me think about the possible energy levels and how the particles fill them.

Wait, another approach: the energies of the system are the sum of the individual energies of each particle. So for four particles, each in a certain n and spin state.

Ground state: Each particle fills the lowest possible n. So two in n=1 (each with opposite spins) and two in n=2 (each with opposite spins). So the total energy is 2*(1² E) + 2*(2² E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.

First excited state: One of the particles from n=2 moves to n=3. So now, n=1 has two, n=2 has one, n=3 has one. The energy would be 2E +4E +9E = 15E.

Second excited state: Another particle from n=2 moves to n=3, but that's not possible because n=2 can only have two particles. Wait, but in the first excited state, n=2 has only one particle, so moving another from n=2 to n=3 would require that n=2 has another particle. Hmm, perhaps the second excited state is when n=2 is filled (two particles) and one in n=3 and another in n=4. Wait, but that would require four particles: 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3, 1 in n=4. So the energy would be 2*(4E) + 9E +16E = 8E +9E +16E=33E.

Wait, but wait that's 33E, which isn't one of the options. So perhaps that's not the correct approach.

Alternatively, maybe the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=1. But wait, each n can hold two, so n=3 can have two, and n=1 can have two. So the total would be 4 particles: 2 in n=1, 2 in n=3. The energy would be 2*(1E) + 2*(9E)=2E +18E=20E.

Wait, but let me think again: in the ground state, the four particles are 2 in n=1 and 2 in n=2. That's 10E.

In the first excited state, perhaps the configuration is 2 in n=1 and 1 each in n=2 and n=3 → 15E.

In the second excited state, perhaps the configuration is 2 in n=1 and 2 in n=3 → 20E.

Looking at the options, option B has 4E, 10E, 50E. That doesn't fit.

Option C: 4E, 10E, 15E. Hmm, no.

Wait, but in that case, the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, and second excited 20E. But none of the options match that.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Perhaps for four particles, the ground state is when all four are in the same n? But that's impossible because each n can hold only two particles. So that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the ground state is when the particles are arranged in the lowest possible levels with the lowest possible n's, but maybe the next states involve higher n's.

Alternatively, perhaps the first and second excited states involve different distributions. Let's list all possible possible ways to arrange four particles into the lowest energy levels, considering that each n can hold two particles.

The possible arrangements are:

1. n=1 (2 particles), n=2 (2) → ground state → total energy 10E.

2. n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1) → first excited state → 15E.

3. n=1 (2), n=3 (2) → second excited state → 2*1E + 2*9E = 2E +18E =20E.

But looking at the options, none have 20E. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility for the first excited state might be when one particle is promoted from n=1 to n=2, but that's not possible because n=1 is already filled with two. So that's not allowed.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when the particles are arranged as n=1 (1), n=2 (2), n=3 (1). But that would require that in n=1, only one is present, which would be if one particle moved from n=1 to n=3. But that's higher in energy, so that would be a higher state than the ground state.

Wait, but in the ground state, n=1 is filled with two particles. So moving one from n=1 to another level would require a higher energy, which would make the configuration higher. So perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=1 to n=2, but that's not possible as n=2 is already filled.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the order of filling. Let me think about the possible states in order of increasing energy.

The ground state: 2 in n=1, 2 in n=2 → energy 10E.

Next, the first excited state could be when one particle is promoted to n=3, so 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3 → energy 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Then, the second excited state could be when another particle is promoted to n=3, making 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3 → energy 2E +0 + 2*9E=2E +18E=20E.

But looking at the options, none of them include 20E. So perhaps I'm missing another possible arrangement.

Wait, another possibility: what if the first excited state is when n=2 is completely filled (two particles) and one is promoted to n=3, but that would require three particles in n=3, which isn't allowed. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when the particles are arranged in n=1 (2), n=2 (2), and n=3 (0), but that's the same as the ground state, which it's not.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me look again at the options.

Looking at option D: 10E, 15E, 18E.

If the ground state were 10E, the first excited state 15E, then what would the second excited state be? 18E. So 18E would come from a configuration where the energy is 18E. How?

Let me think: 18E = sum of individual energies. Let's see what combination gives 18E.

Possible options: 2E (n=1) + 4E (n=2) + 12E (but 12E isn't a square number. Or maybe 1E + 1E + 4E + 12E → doesn't make sense.

Wait, wait. Let me think of 18E as the sum: perhaps 2E (n=1, two particles) + 4E (n=2, two particles) + 12E? No, because each E is n squared. Wait, but 18E could be 2*(n=3) + 2*(n=2) → 2*(9E) + 2*(4E) = 18E +8E =26E, which is way higher.

Alternatively, maybe 2*(n=3) + 2*(n=1) → 2*9E + 2*1E =18E + 2E=20E. No.

Alternatively, perhaps one particle in n=4 (16E) and others in lower levels. Let's see: 2*(n=1) →2E, one in n=3 →9E, one in n=4 →16E. Sum: 2E +9E +16E=27E. No, that's not 18E.

Hmm, maybe another approach: perhaps the second excited state is when the particles are arranged as n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1), and n=4 (0). Wait, but that's the same as the first excited state. Or maybe n=1 (2), n=2 (0), n=3 (2). Then, the sum would be 2E + 0 + 2*9E= 2E +18E=20E. Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible options given and see which one fits.

Looking at the options, option D says ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E.

How can the sum be 18E? Let's see:

Possible combinations:

- 1E (n=1) and 17E? No, because 17 isn't a square.

- 4E (n=2) × two particles → 8E, plus 10E from elsewhere. That doesn't add up.

Wait, another possibility: three particles in n=2 (but that's impossible, since n=2 can hold only two), so that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and one in n=2 and one in n=1. Hmm, that arrangement would have 2 in n=3 (18E), 1 in n=2 (4E), 1 in n=1 (E), sum 18 +4 +1=23E. Still not matching.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the possible energy levels and their possible sums for four particles.

Ground state: 2 in n=1, 2 in n=2 → 2*1E + 2*4E = 2E +8E=10E.

First excited state: 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3 → 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Second excited state: 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3 → 2E + 0 + 18E=20E.

But none of the options have 20E. So perhaps the second excited state is when n=1 has 1, n=2 has 2, n=3 has 1. Wait, that would sum to 1E + 8E +9E=18E. But how?

Wait, wait, let me calculate that: 1E (n=1) + 2*4E (n=2) → 8E + 9E (n=3) →1+8+9=18E.

So the configuration would be: 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3. That sums to four particles.

Is that a possible configuration? Let's see: n=1 has one, n=2 has two (max), n=3 has one.

Wait, but according to the Pauli exclusion principle, each n can have two particles (each with opposite spins). So, in this case, n=1 has only one particle. Why would that be the case when it can hold two? Because in the ground state, it's filled with two. So this configuration would require that in the first excited state, a particle was promoted from n=1 to n=3, but that would be a higher energy.

Wait, but that would make the ground state higher? No, because in the ground state, all lower n's are filled as much as possible. So that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps this is the second excited state. So the configuration is:

n=1: 1 particle.

n=2: 2 particles.

n=3: 1 particle.

Total energy: 1E + 8E +9E=18E.

So the energies would be:

Ground state: 10E.

First excited state: 15E.

Second excited state: 18E.

Which matches option D: 10E, 15E, 18E.

So the correct answer would be option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we analyze the system as follows:

### Energy Levels in the Infinite Potential Well
The energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well are given by:

\[
E_n = n^2 E, \quad \text{where } E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2}.
\]

Thus, the energy levels are:
- \(E_1 = 1^2 E = E\),
- \(E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E\),
- \(E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E\),
- \(E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E\), and so on.

### Ground State
In the ground state, the particles fill the lowest available energy levels, obeying the Pauli exclusion principle. Each energy level \(n\) can hold two particles (one for each spin state: up and down). Therefore:
- Two particles occupy \(n=1\) (\(2 \times E_1 = 2E\)),
- Two particles occupy \(n=2\) (\(2 \times E_2 = 8E\)).

The total energy of the ground state is:
\[
E_{\text{ground}} = 2E + 8E = 10E.
\]

### First Excited State
In the first excited state, one particle is promoted from \(n=2\) to \(n=3\), while the remaining particles remain in \(n=1\) and \(n=2\). The configuration is:
- Two particles in \(n=1\) (\(2 \times E_1 = 2E\)),
- One particle in \(n=2\) (\(1 \times E_2 = 4E\)),
- One particle in \(n=3\) (\(1 \times E_3 = 9E\)).

The total energy of the first excited state is:
\[
E_{\text{first excited}} = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.
\]

### Second Excited State
In the second excited state, another particle is promoted from \(n=2\) to \(n=3\). The configuration is:
- Two particles in \(n=1\) (\(2 \times E_1 = 2E\)),
- Zero particles in \(n=2\),
- Two particles in \(n=3\) (\(2 \times E_3 = 18E\)).

The total energy of the second excited state is:
\[
E_{\text{second excited}} = 2E + 18E = 20E.
\]

### Matching with the Options
From the calculations:
- Ground state energy: \(10E\),
- First excited state energy: \(15E\),
- Second excited state energy: \(20E\).

However, none of the options explicitly include \(20E\). Upon re-evaluating the possible configurations, another valid arrangement for the second excited state is:
- One particle in \(n=1\) (\(1 \times E_1 = E\)),
- Two particles in \(n=2\) (\(2 \times E_2 = 8E\)),
- One particle in \(n=3\) (\(1 \times E_3 = 9E\)).

The total energy for this configuration is:
\[
E_{\text{second excited}} = E + 8E + 9E = 18E.
\]

This matches option **D**, which lists the energies as \(10E\), \(15E\), and \(18E\).

### Final Answer
The correct option is:

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I've got this physics problem about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but let's try to think this through.

The question asks for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are given, so maybe I can figure it out by considering how particles are filled into energy levels.

Wait, the particles are spin-1/2, so each can have two possible spin states: up or down. That means each energy level can hold two particles, right? Because each state is two-fold degenerate due to spin.

The system is in a 1D infinite potential well of length L. The energy levels for a single particle in such a well are given by E_n = (n² π² ħ²)/(2mL²). Oh wait, the problem states E = π² ħ²/(2mL²), so E_n is n² times E. So E_1 is E, E_2 is 4E, E_3 is 9E, E_4 is 16E, and so on.

Now, we have four particles. Since they're fermions (spin-1/2 implies they're fermions), they obey the Pauli exclusion principle. So each quantum state can hold at most two particles (because of spin up and down).

So let's think about how the particles fill up the energy levels. The ground state would have the lowest possible energy, so we need to fill the lowest energy levels first, each with two particles each, until all four are placed.

Let's list the energy levels:

n=1: E_1 = 1² E = E → can hold 2 particles
n=2: E_2 = 4E → another 2 particles
n=3: E_3=9E → but we only have four particles, so maybe not all filled.

Wait, wait, four particles. So n=1 can hold 2, n=2 holds another 2. So all four would be filled in the n=1 and n=2 levels. So the ground state is when all four are filled in the lowest possible energy states.

Wait but wait, maybe it's not that simple. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again.

Each energy level n has a certain number of states, each with a specific quantum number n and spin up or down. So for each n, there are two possible states (spin up and down), so each n can hold two particles.

So for four particles, let's distribute them across the lowest n's.

Ground state: fill the lowest energy levels first.

n=1: 2 particles (spin up and down)
n=2: 2 particles (spin up and down)
So all four are placed. So the total energy would be 2*E_1 + 2*E_2 = 2*E + 2*4E = 2E +8E=10E.

Wait, but wait a second, the question says "energies of the ground state", etc. So maybe it's the total energy of the system in each state. Hmm.

But the options don't include 10E as the total ground state. Let me look at the options.

Option B's ground state is 4E. Hmm, maybe I misunderstood the question. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the energy of each individual state, not the total. Or wait, no, the question says "energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system". So it's the total energy of the system in each of these states.

Wait, but in the ground state, the particles are all in the lowest possible states. So if each particle is in a state with n=1 and n=2, but wait, no, particles can't all be in n=1 because of spin. Oh, right, each n can have two particles. So n=1 holds two, n=2 holds two. So the ground state total energy is 2*(E) + 2*(4E) = 2E +8E=10E.

Wait, but let me go through the possible states step by step.

Ground state: all four particles are filled in the lowest possible energy levels. So the first two particles go into n=1 (each with opposite spins), and the next two go into n=2 (each with opposite spins). So the total energy is 2E_1 + 2E_2 = 2E + 8E = 10E.

Wait but that would make the ground state energy 10E. Looking at the options, option B says ground state is 4E, and option C says 4E for ground state.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe I should think about each particle's energy and sum them.

Wait, for four particles: two in n=1, two in n=2.

Each in n=1 contributes E_1 = E. So two of them: 2E.

Each in n=2 contributes E_2 =4E. So two of them: 8E.

Total: 2E +8E=10E. So the ground state energy is 10E.

But option B's first option is 4E. Hmm, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I'm not considering the order correctly. Maybe the ground state is when the particles are filled in the lowest possible states, but perhaps each state can have only one particle because of some other constraint? Wait, no, spin-1/2 particles have spin up and down, so each energy level can hold two. So the ground state would have two in n=1 and two in n=2, giving a total of 10E. So which option has ground state as 10E? Let's check.

Option A: 30, 39, 50 → No.

Option B: 4E, 10E, 50E → ground is 4E. Doesn't seem right.

Option C: 4E, 10E, 15E → ground 4E.

Option D: 10E, 15E, 18E → No, ground is 10E.

Wait, wait, but 10E is the ground state in option D. So if that's the case, but let's think about the first excited state.

Wait the question is about the energies of the ground, first excited, and second excited states of the system. So each of these will have a different arrangement of the particles in the energy levels.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the concepts. Let me think again: the ground state is the lowest possible energy, first excited is the next higher energy, and second excited is the next after that.

So let me think about the possible configurations.

In the ground state (lowest energy), the particles are in the lowest possible energy levels. So as before, n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles). So energy is 2*E + 2*4E = 10E.

Now, what's the first excited state? That would be the next lowest energy configuration.

Possibly, it's when one of the particles from n=2 moves to a higher n. But wait, since each n can only hold two particles, maybe the next state is when one particle moves from n=2 to n=3. But wait, can a particle jump multiple levels?

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when the highest occupied n is increased. So, after the ground state (n=1, 2), the first excited state might involve moving one particle from n=2 to n=3, but wait, n=3 can only take two particles. Or maybe all four particles are in the same n=1 and n=2, but that's the ground state.

Wait, no. Maybe the first excited state is when all four particles are in the first two levels, but perhaps the arrangement is different. Hmm, no, that wouldn't be a higher energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, but that would require that n=3 has at least one particle.

Wait, but particles fill the lowest possible states first. So perhaps in the first excited state, the configuration is three particles in n=1 (but that's not possible because each n can only hold two). So that's not allowed.

Wait, maybe the first excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3. Let's see: so in the ground state, n=1 (2) and n=2 (2). In the first excited state, n=1 (2), n=2 (1), and n=3 (1). But wait, can a single particle be in n=3? Because each n can hold two particles, so perhaps that's allowed. So the total energy would be 2*E + 1*4E + 1*9E = 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Wait, but that would make the first excited state 15E. Then the second excited state would be when another particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3 or n=4.

Wait, but let's think about other possibilities. Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle in n=2 is promoted to n=3, so the configuration is n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1).

Wait, but that's only three particles. We have four, so all four must be placed.

Ah, wait, perhaps the first excited state is when the two particles in n=2 are promoted to higher states, but in a way that the total energy is the next possible. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, so the configuration is n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). That would require four particles: 2+1+1=4. So the energy would be 2E + 4E +9E = 15E.

Hmm, but wait, another possibility: perhaps the first excited state is when the two particles in n=2 are promoted to n=3, but that would require four particles in n=3, which can't be because each n can hold two. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, maybe the first excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, and another from n=2 to n=4? Wait, but then the total number of particles would be 2 (n=1) + 1 (n=2) + 1(n=3) + 1(n=4) → that's 5 particles, which is more than four. So that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is moved from n=2 to n=3, and another from n=2 to n=3, but that would require four particles in n=3, which is not allowed (since each n can hold two). So that's impossible.

Wait, maybe another approach: think of the possible energy levels and how the particles fill them beyond the ground state.

Wait, the ground state is when all four are in n=1 and n=2, with 2 each. Then, the first excited state is the next possible arrangement. That would involve moving one of the particles from n=2 to the next available level, which is n=3. But that would require putting one particle in n=3. So the configuration becomes n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). So the energy is 2E + 4E +9E = 15E.

But wait, that's adding 15E, but the ground state was 10E, so 15E is higher than that. But is that the first excited state?

Wait, but maybe there's another possibility where the particles are arranged in a way that the sum of energies is lower than 15E but higher than 10E. Hmm, I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state occurs when all four particles are in the same n=2 level. But wait, each n can only hold two particles, so that's impossible. Because putting four particles in n=2 would require four, but each n can only have two (two spins). So that's not allowed.

So the next possible state after the ground state is when the particles are distributed as n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1), leading to a total energy of 15E. So the first excited state would be 15E.

Wait, but what's the second excited state? That would be the next higher energy after 15E. So perhaps moving another particle from n=2 to n=3, but that's not possible because n=2 only has one particle left. Alternatively, moving the remaining n=2 particle to n=4.

Wait, let's think: in the first excited state, we have n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1), total energy 15E. The second excited state would involve moving the last particle from n=2 to n=4, so the configuration becomes n=1 (2), n=2 (0), n=3 (1), n=4 (1). The energy would be 2E + 0*4E +9E +16E = 2E + 9E +16E = 27E.

Wait, but that's higher than 15E, so perhaps that's the second excited state.

But wait, maybe the second excited state is when both n=2 particles are promoted to higher levels. But that's not possible because each n can take only two. Alternatively, maybe the second excited state is when another particle is promoted from n=3 to a higher level.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider other possibilities. Let me think about the possible energy levels and how the particles fill them.

Wait, another approach: the energies of the system are the sum of the individual energies of each particle. So for four particles, each in a certain n and spin state.

Ground state: Each particle fills the lowest possible n. So two in n=1 (each with opposite spins) and two in n=2 (each with opposite spins). So the total energy is 2*(1² E) + 2*(2² E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.

First excited state: One of the particles from n=2 moves to n=3. So now, n=1 has two, n=2 has one, n=3 has one. The energy would be 2E +4E +9E = 15E.

Second excited state: Another particle from n=2 moves to n=3, but that's not possible because n=2 can only have two particles. Wait, but in the first excited state, n=2 has only one particle, so moving another from n=2 to n=3 would require that n=2 has another particle. Hmm, perhaps the second excited state is when n=2 is filled (two particles) and one in n=3 and another in n=4. Wait, but that would require four particles: 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3, 1 in n=4. So the energy would be 2*(4E) + 9E +16E = 8E +9E +16E=33E.

Wait, but wait that's 33E, which isn't one of the options. So perhaps that's not the correct approach.

Alternatively, maybe the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=1. But wait, each n can hold two, so n=3 can have two, and n=1 can have two. So the total would be 4 particles: 2 in n=1, 2 in n=3. The energy would be 2*(1E) + 2*(9E)=2E +18E=20E.

Wait, but let me think again: in the ground state, the four particles are 2 in n=1 and 2 in n=2. That's 10E.

In the first excited state, perhaps the configuration is 2 in n=1 and 1 each in n=2 and n=3 → 15E.

In the second excited state, perhaps the configuration is 2 in n=1 and 2 in n=3 → 20E.

Looking at the options, option B has 4E, 10E, 50E. That doesn't fit.

Option C: 4E, 10E, 15E. Hmm, no.

Wait, but in that case, the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, and second excited 20E. But none of the options match that.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Perhaps for four particles, the ground state is when all four are in the same n? But that's impossible because each n can hold only two particles. So that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the ground state is when the particles are arranged in the lowest possible levels with the lowest possible n's, but maybe the next states involve higher n's.

Alternatively, perhaps the first and second excited states involve different distributions. Let's list all possible possible ways to arrange four particles into the lowest energy levels, considering that each n can hold two particles.

The possible arrangements are:

1. n=1 (2 particles), n=2 (2) → ground state → total energy 10E.

2. n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1) → first excited state → 15E.

3. n=1 (2), n=3 (2) → second excited state → 2*1E + 2*9E = 2E +18E =20E.

But looking at the options, none have 20E. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility for the first excited state might be when one particle is promoted from n=1 to n=2, but that's not possible because n=1 is already filled with two. So that's not allowed.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when the particles are arranged as n=1 (1), n=2 (2), n=3 (1). But that would require that in n=1, only one is present, which would be if one particle moved from n=1 to n=3. But that's higher in energy, so that would be a higher state than the ground state.

Wait, but in the ground state, n=1 is filled with two particles. So moving one from n=1 to another level would require a higher energy, which would make the configuration higher. So perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=1 to n=2, but that's not possible as n=2 is already filled.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the order of filling. Let me think about the possible states in order of increasing energy.

The ground state: 2 in n=1, 2 in n=2 → energy 10E.

Next, the first excited state could be when one particle is promoted to n=3, so 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3 → energy 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Then, the second excited state could be when another particle is promoted to n=3, making 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3 → energy 2E +0 + 2*9E=2E +18E=20E.

But looking at the options, none of them include 20E. So perhaps I'm missing another possible arrangement.

Wait, another possibility: what if the first excited state is when n=2 is completely filled (two particles) and one is promoted to n=3, but that would require three particles in n=3, which isn't allowed. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when the particles are arranged in n=1 (2), n=2 (2), and n=3 (0), but that's the same as the ground state, which it's not.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me look again at the options.

Looking at option D: 10E, 15E, 18E.

If the ground state were 10E, the first excited state 15E, then what would the second excited state be? 18E. So 18E would come from a configuration where the energy is 18E. How?

Let me think: 18E = sum of individual energies. Let's see what combination gives 18E.

Possible options: 2E (n=1) + 4E (n=2) + 12E (but 12E isn't a square number. Or maybe 1E + 1E + 4E + 12E → doesn't make sense.

Wait, wait. Let me think of 18E as the sum: perhaps 2E (n=1, two particles) + 4E (n=2, two particles) + 12E? No, because each E is n squared. Wait, but 18E could be 2*(n=3) + 2*(n=2) → 2*(9E) + 2*(4E) = 18E +8E =26E, which is way higher.

Alternatively, maybe 2*(n=3) + 2*(n=1) → 2*9E + 2*1E =18E + 2E=20E. No.

Alternatively, perhaps one particle in n=4 (16E) and others in lower levels. Let's see: 2*(n=1) →2E, one in n=3 →9E, one in n=4 →16E. Sum: 2E +9E +16E=27E. No, that's not 18E.

Hmm, maybe another approach: perhaps the second excited state is when the particles are arranged as n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1), and n=4 (0). Wait, but that's the same as the first excited state. Or maybe n=1 (2), n=2 (0), n=3 (2). Then, the sum would be 2E + 0 + 2*9E= 2E +18E=20E. Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible options given and see which one fits.

Looking at the options, option D says ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E.

How can the sum be 18E? Let's see:

Possible combinations:

- 1E (n=1) and 17E? No, because 17 isn't a square.

- 4E (n=2) × two particles → 8E, plus 10E from elsewhere. That doesn't add up.

Wait, another possibility: three particles in n=2 (but that's impossible, since n=2 can hold only two), so that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and one in n=2 and one in n=1. Hmm, that arrangement would have 2 in n=3 (18E), 1 in n=2 (4E), 1 in n=1 (E), sum 18 +4 +1=23E. Still not matching.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the possible energy levels and their possible sums for four particles.

Ground state: 2 in n=1, 2 in n=2 → 2*1E + 2*4E = 2E +8E=10E.

First excited state: 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3 → 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Second excited state: 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3 → 2E + 0 + 18E=20E.

But none of the options have 20E. So perhaps the second excited state is when n=1 has 1, n=2 has 2, n=3 has 1. Wait, that would sum to 1E + 8E +9E=18E. But how?

Wait, wait, let me calculate that: 1E (n=1) + 2*4E (n=2) → 8E + 9E (n=3) →1+8+9=18E.

So the configuration would be: 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3. That sums to four particles.

Is that a possible configuration? Let's see: n=1 has one, n=2 has two (max), n=3 has one.

Wait, but according to the Pauli exclusion principle, each n can have two particles (each with opposite spins). So, in this case, n=1 has only one particle. Why would that be the case when it can hold two? Because in the ground state, it's filled with two. So this configuration would require that in the first excited state, a particle was promoted from n=1 to n=3, but that would be a higher energy.

Wait, but that would make the ground state higher? No, because in the ground state, all lower n's are filled as much as possible. So that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps this is the second excited state. So the configuration is:

n=1: 1 particle.

n=2: 2 particles.

n=3: 1 particle.

Total energy: 1E + 8E +9E=18E.

So the energies would be:

Ground state: 10E.

First excited state: 15E.

Second excited state: 18E.

Which matches option D: 10E, 15E, 18E.

So the correct answer would be option D.


To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we analyze the system as follows:

### Energy Levels in the Infinite Potential Well
The energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well are given by:

\[
E_n = n^2 E, \quad \text{where } E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2}.
\]

Thus, the energy levels are:
- \(E_1 = 1^2 E = E\),
- \(E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E\),
- \(E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E\),
- \(E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E\), and so on.

### Ground State
In the ground state, the particles fill the lowest available energy levels, obeying the Pauli exclusion principle. Each energy level \(n\) can hold two particles (one for each spin state: up and down). Therefore:
- Two particles occupy \(n=1\) (\(2 \times E_1 = 2E\)),
- Two particles occupy \(n=2\) (\(2 \times E_2 = 8E\)).

The total energy of the ground state is:
\[
E_{\text{ground}} = 2E + 8E = 10E.
\]

### First Excited State
In the first excited state, one particle is promoted from \(n=2\) to \(n=3\), while the remaining particles remain in \(n=1\) and \(n=2\). The configuration is:
- Two particles in \(n=1\) (\(2 \times E_1 = 2E\)),
- One particle in \(n=2\) (\(1 \times E_2 = 4E\)),
- One particle in \(n=3\) (\(1 \times E_3 = 9E\)).

The total energy of the first excited state is:
\[
E_{\text{first excited}} = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.
\]

### Second Excited State
In the second excited state, another particle is promoted from \(n=2\) to \(n=3\). The configuration is:
- Two particles in \(n=1\) (\(2 \times E_1 = 2E\)),
- Zero particles in \(n=2\),
- Two particles in \(n=3\) (\(2 \times E_3 = 18E\)).

The total energy of the second excited state is:
\[
E_{\text{second excited}} = 2E + 18E = 20E.
\]

### Matching with the Options
From the calculations:
- Ground state energy: \(10E\),
- First excited state energy: \(15E\),
- Second excited state energy: \(20E\).

However, none of the options explicitly include \(20E\). Upon re-evaluating the possible configurations, another valid arrangement for the second excited state is:
- One particle in \(n=1\) (\(1 \times E_1 = E\)),
- Two particles in \(n=2\) (\(2 \times E_2 = 8E\)),
- One particle in \(n=3\) (\(1 \times E_3 = 9E\)).

The total energy for this configuration is:
\[
E_{\text{second excited}} = E + 8E + 9E = 18E.
\]

This matches option **D**, which lists the energies as \(10E\), \(15E\), and \(18E\).

### Final Answer
The correct option is:

**Answer: D**
