Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the energy spectrum for a particle in a two-dimensional potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Hmm, let me break this down.

First, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the potential often determines the form of the energy levels. So I need to analyze this potential to see what system it resembles. The potential has two terms: the first is (1/2)kr², which looks like a harmonic oscillator term because the potential energy for a quantum harmonic oscillator is (1/2) m ω² x², or in polar coordinates, something like (1/2) m ω² r². Wait, but wait, the potential here is (1/2)kr². So that might be a 2D isotropic harmonic oscillator if everything is symmetric. But the second term complicates things.

The second term is (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Cos squared theta suggests some angular dependence. Let me think about how potentials with angular terms are handled. Oh, right, when you have angular terms, sometimes you can separate the problem into radial and angular parts. Also, cos²θ can be written using a double-angle identity: cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. But I'm not sure if that helps yet.

Wait, in two dimensions, if the potential is separable into radial and angular parts, it might not be straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I can rewrite the potential in terms of Cartesian coordinates. Let me try that. Because r² in Cartesian is x² + y². Cosθ is x/r, so cos²θ is x²/r². So substituting back, the potential becomes:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2) k r² (x² / r²) 

Simplifying, since r² is x² + y², and x² is part of that. So the second term becomes (3/2)k x². Wait, so this would make the potential:

(1/2)k r² + (3/2) k x² = (1/2)k(x² + y²) + (3/2)k x² 

Let me add those terms together. (1/2)x² + (1/2)y² + (3/2)x² = ( (1/2 + 3/2) x² ) + (1/2 y² ) = 2x² + (1/2)y² all multiplied by k. So the potential is (2k x² + (1/2)k y²). 

Wait, that's interesting. So the potential in x and y directions are different. So in the x-direction, the potential is (2k) x², which is like a harmonic oscillator with some frequency, and in the y-direction, it's (1/2 k) y², another harmonic oscillator but with a different frequency. 

So the system is a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator where the potential is anisotropic—meaning it's not the same in all directions. So each direction has its own frequency. In a 2D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by E = ħω_x (n_x + 1/2) + ħω_y (n_y + 1/2), where n_x and n_y are quantum numbers (non-negative integers). 

So I need to find the frequencies ω_x and ω_y for each direction. The potential in x is 2k x². The standard potential for a harmonic oscillator is (1/2) m ω² x². So, setting 2k = (1/2) m ω². Wait, wait, wait. Our potential is V(x) = (2k) x². So comparing to (1/2)m ω² x², we have 2k = (1/2) m ω², so ω² = (4k)/m, so ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 sqrt(k/m). 

Similarly, the potential in the y-direction is (1/2)k y². So (1/2)k = (1/2) m ω². So m ω² = k, so ω² = k/m. Therefore, ω_y = sqrt(k/m). 

So, putting it all together, the energy for each direction is:

E_x = ħ ω_x (n_x + 1/2) = ħ (2 sqrt(k/m)) (n_x + 1/2)
E_y = ħ ω_y (n_y + 1/2) = ħ sqrt(k/m) (n_y + 1/2)

So total energy E is sum: E = ħ sqrt(k/m) [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)].

Let me factor out sqrt(k/m), which is common. So E = ħ sqrt(k/m) [ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ]

Wait, 2(n_x + 1/2) is 2n_x +1, and (n_y + 1/2) is n_y +1/2. So adding those, 2n_x + n_y + 1 + 1/2 = 2n_x + n_y + 3/2.

So the energy becomes E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ħ sqrt(k/m). 

Wait, let me check. So  E = ħ sqrt(k/m) [ 2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ]

Yes. So looking at the options, option C is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ħ sqrt(k/m). So that must be the correct answer.

Wait, but looking back, did I mix up the contributions? Let me double-check. The x-direction has 2k x². So in the HO potential, (1/2) m ω² x². So 2k = (1/2) m ω_x² → ω_x² = (4k)/m → ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m). Thus, E_x = ħ ω_x (n_x + 1/2) = ħ (2 sqrt(k/m)) (n_x + 1/2).

Similarly, y-direction: (1/2) k y² → (1/2) m ω_y² y² → k = m ω_y^2 → ω_y = sqrt(k/m). So E_y = ħ sqrt(k/m) (n_y + 1/2).

Adding them: E = ħ sqrt(k/m) [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ].

Expanding: 2n_x +1 + n_y + 1/2 = 2n_x +n_y + 3/2. So yes, the same as before.

Looking at the options again:

Option C) E = (2n_x +n_y + 3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m). Yes, that's exactly what we have.

The potential is given as \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cos^2\theta \). To analyze this, the potential is rewritten in Cartesian coordinates. Using \( r^2 = x^2 + y^2 \) and \( \cos^2\theta = \frac{x^2}{r^2} \), the potential becomes:

\[
V(x, y) = \frac{1}{2}k(x^2 + y^2) + \frac{3}{2}k \frac{x^2}{r^2} \cdot r^2 = \frac{1}{2}k(x^2 + y^2) + \frac{3}{2}kx^2.
\]

Simplifying, this gives:

\[
V(x, y) = \left(\frac{1}{2}k + \frac{3}{2}k\right)x^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2 = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2.
\]

This represents a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator, where the potential in the \(x\)-direction is \(2kx^2\) and in the \(y\)-direction is \(\frac{1}{2}ky^2\). The energy levels for a quantum harmonic oscillator are given by:

\[
E = \hbar \omega (n + \frac{1}{2}),
\]

where \(\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\) for the standard harmonic oscillator potential \(\frac{1}{2}kx^2\). For the \(x\)-direction, the potential \(2kx^2\) corresponds to \(\omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\), and for the \(y\)-direction, the potential \(\frac{1}{2}ky^2\) corresponds to \(\omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\).

The total energy is the sum of the contributions from the \(x\)- and \(y\)-directions:

\[
E = \hbar \omega_x (n_x + \frac{1}{2}) + \hbar \omega_y (n_y + \frac{1}{2}),
\]

where \(n_x\) and \(n_y\) are non-negative integers. Substituting \(\omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\) and \(\omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\), the energy becomes:

\[
E = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left[ 2(n_x + \frac{1}{2}) + (n_y + \frac{1}{2}) \right].
\]

Simplifying further:

\[
E = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left[ 2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2} \right].
\]

This matches the form of option **C**, which is:

\[
E = (2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}) \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the energy spectrum for a particle in a two-dimensional potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Hmm, let me break this down.

Oh, right, when you have angular terms, sometimes you can separate the problem into radial and angular parts. Also, cos²θ can be written using a double-angle identity: cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2.

So substituting back, the potential becomes:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2) k r² (x² / r²) 

Simplifying, since r² is x² + y², and x² is part of that. So the second term becomes (3/2)k x². Wait, so this would make the potential:

(1/2)k r² + (3/2) k x² = (1/2)k(x² + y²) + (3/2)k x² 

Let me add those terms together. (1/2)x² + (1/2)y² + (3/2)x² = ( (1/2 + 3/2) x² ) + (1/2 y² ) = 2x² + (1/2)y² all multiplied by k. So the potential is (2k x² + (1/2)k y²). 

Wait, that's interesting. So the potential in x and y directions are different. So in the x-direction, the potential is (2k) x², which is like a harmonic oscillator with some frequency, and in the y-direction, it's (1/2 k) y², another harmonic oscillator but with a different frequency. 

So the system is a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator where the potential is anisotropic—meaning it's not the same in all directions. So each direction has its own frequency. In a 2D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by E = ħω_x (n_x + 1/2) + ħω_y (n_y + 1/2), where n_x and n_y are quantum numbers (non-negative integers). 

So I need to find the frequencies ω_x and ω_y for each direction. The potential in x is 2k x². The standard potential for a harmonic oscillator is (1/2) m ω² x². So, setting 2k = (1/2) m ω². Wait, wait, wait. Our potential is V(x) = (2k) x². So comparing to (1/2)m ω² x², we have 2k = (1/2) m ω², so ω² = (4k)/m, so ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 sqrt(k/m). 

Similarly, the potential in the y-direction is (1/2)k y². So (1/2)k = (1/2) m ω². So m ω² = k, so ω² = k/m. Therefore, ω_y = sqrt(k/m). 

So, putting it all together, the energy for each direction is:

E_x = ħ ω_x (n_x + 1/2) = ħ (2 sqrt(k/m)) (n_x + 1/2)
E_y = ħ ω_y (n_y + 1/2) = ħ sqrt(k/m) (n_y + 1/2)

So total energy E is sum: E = ħ sqrt(k/m) [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)].

Let me factor out sqrt(k/m), which is common. So E = ħ sqrt(k/m) [ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ]

Wait, 2(n_x + 1/2) is 2n_x +1, and (n_y + 1/2) is n_y +1/2. So adding those, 2n_x + n_y + 1 + 1/2 = 2n_x + n_y + 3/2.

So the energy becomes E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ħ sqrt(k/m). 

Wait, let me check. So  E = ħ sqrt(k/m) [ 2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ]

Yes. So looking at the options, option C is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ħ sqrt(k/m). So that must be the correct answer.

Wait, but looking back, did I mix up the contributions? Let me double-check. The x-direction has 2k x². So in the HO potential, (1/2) m ω² x². So 2k = (1/2) m ω_x² → ω_x² = (4k)/m → ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m). Thus, E_x = ħ ω_x (n_x + 1/2) = ħ (2 sqrt(k/m)) (n_x + 1/2).

Similarly, y-direction: (1/2) k y² → (1/2) m ω_y² y² → k = m ω_y^2 → ω_y = sqrt(k/m). So E_y = ħ sqrt(k/m) (n_y + 1/2).

Adding them: E = ħ sqrt(k/m) [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ].

Expanding: 2n_x +1 + n_y + 1/2 = 2n_x +n_y + 3/2. So yes, the same as before.

Looking at the options again:

Option C) E = (2n_x +n_y + 3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m). Yes, that's exactly what we have.


The potential is given as \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cos^2\theta \). To analyze this, the potential is rewritten in Cartesian coordinates. Using \( r^2 = x^2 + y^2 \) and \( \cos^2\theta = \frac{x^2}{r^2} \), the potential becomes:

\[
V(x, y) = \frac{1}{2}k(x^2 + y^2) + \frac{3}{2}k \frac{x^2}{r^2} \cdot r^2 = \frac{1}{2}k(x^2 + y^2) + \frac{3}{2}kx^2.
\]

Simplifying, this gives:

\[
V(x, y) = \left(\frac{1}{2}k + \frac{3}{2}k\right)x^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2 = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2.
\]

This represents a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator, where the potential in the \(x\)-direction is \(2kx^2\) and in the \(y\)-direction is \(\frac{1}{2}ky^2\). The energy levels for a quantum harmonic oscillator are given by:

\[
E = \hbar \omega (n + \frac{1}{2}),
\]

where \(\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\) for the standard harmonic oscillator potential \(\frac{1}{2}kx^2\). For the \(x\)-direction, the potential \(2kx^2\) corresponds to \(\omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\), and for the \(y\)-direction, the potential \(\frac{1}{2}ky^2\) corresponds to \(\omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\).

The total energy is the sum of the contributions from the \(x\)- and \(y\)-directions:

\[
E = \hbar \omega_x (n_x + \frac{1}{2}) + \hbar \omega_y (n_y + \frac{1}{2}),
\]

where \(n_x\) and \(n_y\) are non-negative integers. Substituting \(\omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\) and \(\omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\), the energy becomes:

\[
E = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left[ 2(n_x + \frac{1}{2}) + (n_y + \frac{1}{2}) \right].
\]

Simplifying further:

\[
E = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left[ 2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2} \right].
\]

This matches the form of option **C**, which is:

\[
E = (2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}) \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
