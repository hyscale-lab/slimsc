Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step. 

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are given: c(Co) is 1e-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the different complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex among all cobalt species.

Wait, first I should remember what stability constants mean. I think a stability constant (β) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of a complex ion. For a general reaction like Co^2+ + n SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_n]^2+ + n e^-, the β would be [ [Co(SCN)_n]^2+ ] / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n ). 

So each β corresponds to a different complex. Let's list the possible complexes:

- [Co(SCN)]^+ → n=1, β1=9
- [Co(SCN)_2]^0 → n=2, β2=40
- [Co(SCN)_3]^- → n=3, β3=63
- [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} → n=4, β4=16

The question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands. So that's the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex, which is the second one, with β2=40. So we need to find the percentage of this species compared to all possible cobalt species.

I remember that when multiple complexes can form, the distribution depends on the stability constants and the concentrations of the ligand and metal ions. The general approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex and then sum them up to find the percentage of the desired one.

The formula for the fraction f_n of each complex [Co(SCN)_n]^2+ is given by:

f_n = ( β_n * [SCN]^n ) / ( Σ (β_m * [SCN]^m) for m from 0 to 4 )

Wait, but wait. Wait, the Co exists in different oxidation states? No, here it's Co^2+ all the way. So the possible complexes are from n=0 to n=4. Wait, but wait—n=0 would be Co^2+ with no ligands. Oh right, that's possible too.

Wait, but in our case, the complexes are [Co(SCN)_n]^2+ with n=0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Wait, no. Because for each n, the charge changes. Let me clarify:

Wait, no. For each n, the complex charge is 2+ - n*(−1) because SCN^- is -1 each. So:

n=0 → Co^2+ → charge +2.

n=1 → Co(SCN)]^+ → charge +1 (since 2+ – 1*(-1) = +1.

n=2 → [Co(SCN)_2]^0 → neutral.

n=3 → [Co(SCN)_3]^- → charge -1.

n=4 → [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} → charge -2.

So all these species are possible.

The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all these species. So, the fraction of each species is given by:

f_n = (β_n [SCN]^n ) / (Σ (β_m [SCN]^m ) for m=0 to 4 )

But wait: The β for each complex is given as β1, β2, etc. So I think for each n, the β is as follows:

n=0: the free ion, but wait, the β for that is actually 1, since β is the formation constant. Because for n=0, the complex is just Co^2+ without any SCN-, so the formation constant is [Co^2+]/([Co^2+][SCN]^0) ) → which is 1.

Wait, but the given β values are β1=9 for n=1, β2=40 for n=2, β3=63 for n=3, β4=16 for n=4.

So for n=0, β is 1.

Wait, but the problem statement says the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. So n=1 to n=4. So for the free Co^2+, which is n=0, the stability constant is β0=1.

So the fraction for each species is:

f_n = (β_n [SCN]^n ) / (β0 [SCN]^0 + β1 [SCN]^1 + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

But wait, the way β is defined: for each complex, the β is the constant for forming that complex from Co^2+ and n SCN^-.

So for the n=0 species (free Co^2+), the fraction would be f_0 = [Co^2+] / ( [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + [Co(SCN)_3]^– + [Co(SCN)_4]^{2–} )

But when considering the distribution, the fractions are computed as:

f_n = ( β_n [SCN]^n ) / ( Σ (β_m [SCN]^m ) )

Because each term β_m [SCN]^m is the numerator for the fraction of the m-th complex. So the denominator is the sum for m=0 to 4.

Wait, but β0 is 1, since for n=0, it's the free ion. So the denominator is [SCN]^0 (which is 1) times β0=1, plus [SCN]^1 * β1=9, [SCN]^2 * β2=40, etc.

So let me plug in the numbers.

Given:

[SCN^-] = 0.1 M.

Compute each term for the denominator:

Term for m=0: β0 * [SCN]^0 = 1 * 1 =1.

m=1: β1 * [SCN]^1 =9*(0.1)=0.9.

m=2: β2 * (0.1)^2 =40 * 0.01=0.4.

m=3: β3 * (0.1)^3 =63 * 0.001=0.063.

m=4: β4 * (0.1)^4 =16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016.

So the denominator D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016.

Let me compute each step:

1 + 0.9 = 1.9.

1.9 + 0.4 = 2.3.

2.3 + 0.063 =2.363.

2.363 + 0.0016 ≈2.3646.

So denominator D ≈2.3646.

We are interested in the fraction f_2, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, the dithiocyanato complex.

f_2 = (β2 * [SCN]^2 ) / D = (40 * 0.01) / 2.3646.

40 *0.01 =0.4.

0.4 / 2.3646 ≈0.169.

Wait, 0.4 divided by approximately 2.3646.

Let me compute that more accurately.

2.3646 × 0.169 ≈ 0.399 ≈ 0.4, so 0.169 is about 0.4 / 2.3646.

Wait, but 2.3646 * 0.169 = 0.399?

Wait, 2.3646 * 0.169:

Let me compute 2.3646 * 0.169.

2 * 0.169 = 0.338.

0.3646 * 0.169 ≈0.3646 *0.17 ≈0.062. So total ≈0.338 + 0.062=0.4. So yes, 2.3646 * 0.169 ≈0.4, so 0.4/2.3646≈0.169.

So f_2 ≈0.169, which is 16.9%.

Wait, but the question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. So that would be 16.9%? Hmm, but wait, the options are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%.

So option D is 16.9%.

But wait, does that make sense? Let me think again.

Wait, but in the denominator, I included all terms up to n=4. Oh, but wait, the given β values are up to β4=16. So yes, including all terms.

Wait, but let me double-check the denominator: 1 (m=0) +0.9 (m=1)+0.4(m=2)+0.063(m=3)+0.0016(m=4) = sum is 2.3646.

Then f_2 is 0.4 /2.3646 = approx 0.169, 16.9%.

So the answer would be option D.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: sometimes the formation constants are written with the assumption that the metal is in solution as the free ion. So perhaps the way the fractions are calculated is different.

Alternatively, the general formula is:

The fraction of the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^2+ is given by (β_n [SCN^-]^n) / (1 + Σ (β_m [SCN^-]^m) for m=1 to 4 )

Wait, but why would that be? Because the total concentration of Co is c, which is the sum of all the species. So the denominator is the sum β0 (which is 1) plus all other terms.

So the initial approach was correct.

So the percentage is 16.9%, which is option D.

To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, among all cobalt species in the solution, we use the stability constants provided and the given concentrations of Co(II) and SCN^- ions. The stability constant (β) for each complex is defined as:

\[
\beta_n = \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)_n}]}{[\text{Co}^{2+}][\text{SCN}^-]^n}
\]

The total cobalt concentration is distributed among all possible species: the free ion (Co²⁺), [Co(SCN)]⁺, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]⁻, and [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}. The fraction of each species is given by:

\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n}{\sum_{m=0}^4 \beta_m [\text{SCN}^-]^m}
\]

Here, β₀ = 1 (for the free Co²⁺ ion), β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, and β₄ = 16. The concentration of SCN⁻ is 0.1 M. Substituting these values into the denominator:

\[
\text{Denominator} = \beta_0 [\text{SCN}^-]^0 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-]^1 + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4
\]

\[
\text{Denominator} = 1(1) + 9(0.1) + 40(0.1)^2 + 63(0.1)^3 + 16(0.1)^4
\]

\[
\text{Denominator} = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (n=2), is:

\[
f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2}{\text{Denominator}} = \frac{40(0.1)^2}{2.3646}
\]

\[
f_2 = \frac{40(0.01)}{2.3646} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
\]

Thus, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is:

\[
f_2 \times 100 = 0.169 \times 100 = 16.9\%
\]

Therefore, the correct answer is:
