Okay, so I've got this problem about partition functions for a system of three spins. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on statistical mechanics, but let me think through this step by step.

The problem says each spin can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-β E), where β is 1/(kT). 

Wait, each spin has two possible states, so with three spins, the total number of states should be 2^3 = 8. Each state is a combination of S1, S2, S3 being either +1 or -1.

I need to calculate the energy for each of these 8 states and then sum the exponentials of each energy multiplied by β.

But calculating each state individually might be tedious. Maybe there's a smarter way to group the states by their energies.

Let me think about the possible values of S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Let's call this sum H, so H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Then E = -J H, so each term in the partition function is exp(β J H), since E = -J H → -β E = β J H.

So Z = sum_{all states} exp(β J H). Now I need to find how many states have each possible value of H.

Let me consider what H can be. Each term in H is the product of two spins. Since each spin is ±1, each product S_i S_j is also ±1. So H is the sum of three terms, each ±1. So possible values of H are from -3 to +3, in steps of 2. Wait, can it be any of -3, -1, +1, +3?

Wait, let's see. Let me think about all possible combinations. Maybe the sum can be 3, 1, -1, or -3, depending on the number of +1 and -1 terms.

Alternatively, perhaps only certain values are possible. Let's compute H for some example states.

Case 1: All spins up (S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1). Then H = (1*1) + (1*1) + (1*1) = 3.

Case 2: Two up, one down. Let's say S3=-1, others +1. H = (1*1) + (1*(-1)) + (1*(-1)) = 1 -1 -1 = -1.

Wait, wait. Let me compute each term:

S1S2 = 1*1 = 1
S1S3 = 1*(-1) = -1
S2S3 = 1*(-1) = -1
So H = 1 -1 -1 = -1.

Another case: One up, two down. Let's say S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.
H = (1*(-1)) + (1*(-1)) + ((-1)*(-1)) → (-1) + (-1) + 1 → -1 -1 +1 = -1.

Wait, same as before. Hmm, perhaps when there's only one up, H is -1.

What about all spins down: S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1. Then each product is 1, so H=3.

Another case: Two down, one up. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1. H = ((-1)(-1)) + ((-1)(1)) + ((-1)(1)) → 1 -1 -1 = -1.

Wait, same as earlier. So in all cases where the number of +1 spins is not all three or all zero, H is -1? Wait no, wait another case: Let me think of a state where two are up and one down, but with a different configuration. Maybe S2 is down, others up.

Wait, no, let's think of S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1. Then:

S1S2 = 1
S1S3 = -1
S2S3 = -1
H = 1 -1 -1 = -1.

Another case: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1. H = (-1) + (1) + (-1) → -1 +1 -1 = -1.

Wait, so in all cases except when all are up or all are down, H is -1. Wait, but wait another case: What about when two are opposite and the third is opposite to both? Hmm, perhaps I'm not considering all possibilities.

Wait, let me think of the state S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1: H=3.

Another state: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.

H = (1*(-1)) + (1*(-1)) + ((-1)*(-1)) → (-1) + (-1) + 1 → -1.

Another state: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1 → same as above, H=-1.

Wait, so all the states except the all-up and all-down have H=-1. But wait, wait, when H is the sum of three terms, each ±1. So the sum can be 3, 1, -1, or -3.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me think about another state. Suppose S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.

H = S1S2 = (-1), S1S3 = (+1), S2S3 = (-1). So H = (-1) + (+1) + (-1) = -1.

Another state: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1 → H = 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1.

Another state: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1 → H = (-1) + (-1) + 1 = -1.

Wait, but what about a state where two are the same and the third is same as one of them? No, that's the same as above. Hmm, I'm not seeing any states that give H=1 or H=-3 except when all are same.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing some possibilities. Wait, let me think of all possible states and see what H is.

So the 8 possible states are:

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1 → H=3.

2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1 → H=1*(1) +1*(-1) +1*(-1) → 1 -1 -1 = -1.

3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1 → H= (-1) + (+1) + (-1) → -1.

4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1 → H= (-1) + (-1) + (+1) → -1.

5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1 → H= (-1) + (-1) + (+1) → -1.

6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1 → H= (-1) + (+1) + (-1) → -1.

7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1 → H= (+1) + (-1) + (-1) → -1.

8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1 → H=3.

Wait, that's strange. All the other states except the all-up and all-down have H=-1. So in all 8 states, two have H=3 (all up and all down), and the other six have H=-1.

So H can be 3 or -1. Wait, but wait: when H=3, that's when all are same, so two states (all +1 and all -1).

And for H=-1, it's the other six states.

So each state contributes exp(β J H) to the partition function.

So the partition function Z is:

Z = 2 * exp(β J * 3) + 6 * exp(β J * (-1)).

Wait, because two states have H=3 and six have H=-1.

Wait, but let's make sure. In our calculation above, when the state is all +1, H=3, so each term is exp(β J *3) for each of the two states. And for the other six states, each contributes exp(β J * (-1)).

So Z= 2 e^{3 β J} + 6 e^{- β J}.

But looking at the options, option B is Z=2 e^{3 J β} +6 e^{-J β}, which matches this.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. Oh wait, wait, the energy E is -J H. So the Boltzmann factor is exp(-β E) = exp(β J H), correct.

So in the two states where H=3, the energy E is -3J, so exp(β * 3J) because -β E = β * 3J.

In the six states where H=-1, E is J, because E = -J*(-1) = J. So the Boltzmann factor is exp( -β E ) = exp(-β J ( -1 )) = exp(β J * 1) = exp(β J).

Wait wait, wait a minute, that's a mistake. Let me correct that.

Wait, no. Let's clarify:

If H is S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = H.

Then E = -J H.

So each state's energy is E = -J H.

The Boltzmann factor is exp( -β E ) = exp( β J H ).

So for the two states where H=3, E = -3J, so the factor is exp(3 β J).

For the six states where H=-1, E = -J * (-1) = J, so the factor is exp(-β J * (J)).

Wait, no, wait: E is -J H, so for H=-1, E = - J*(-1) = J. So the Boltzmann factor is exp( -β E ) = exp( -β J ). 

Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. Oh, I see where I went wrong. So in the states where H=-1, the energy is E = J, so the factor is exp(-β J).

So each of the six states contributes exp(-β J), and the two states contribute exp(3 β J).

So Z = 2 e^{3 β J} + 6 e^{- β J}.

Wait, but looking at the options: option B is Z=2 e^{3 J β} +6 e^{-J β}.

Yes, that matches. So the correct answer should be option B.

But wait, another way to compute this: perhaps I should think about the sum of H. Let me think, for each state, H can be 3, 1, -1, -3.

Wait, but in my earlier analysis, only 3 and -1 occurred. Did I miss any state where H=1 or H=-3?

Let me pick another state: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.

H = S1S2 = 1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1.

So H=1 -1 -1 = -1.

Another state: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.

H = (-1) + (-1) + (1) = -1.

Wait, that's the same as before.

What about S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.

H = (-1) + (-1) + (1) = -1.

Hmm, perhaps there's no state where H=1 or H=-3 except when all three are same. So the possible H values are 3 (two states), and -1 (six states).

So the partition function is as I calculated before, leading to option B.

To solve the problem, we calculate the partition function \( Z \) for a system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), where each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \). The energy of the system is given by \( E = -J[S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3] \), and the partition function is defined as:

\[
Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} e^{-\beta E},
\]
where \( \beta = 1/(kT) \). Substituting \( E = -JH \), where \( H = S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \), the partition function becomes:

\[
Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} e^{\beta J H}.
\]

### Step 1: Determine the possible values of \( H \)
Each spin product \( S_iS_j \) can only be \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), so \( H = S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \) can take values \( 3, 1, -1, -3 \). However, by analyzing all 8 possible states of the three spins, it is found that:

- When all spins are the same (\( S_1 = S_2 = S_3 = +1 \) or \( S_1 = S_2 = S_3 = -1 \)), \( H = 3 \). There are **2 such states**.
- For all other states, \( H = -1 \). There are **6 such states**.

Thus, the possible values of \( H \) are \( 3 \) and \( -1 \), with 2 states contributing \( H = 3 \) and 6 states contributing \( H = -1 \).

### Step 2: Calculate the partition function
The partition function is the sum of contributions from all states:

\[
Z = 2e^{\beta J \cdot 3} + 6e^{\beta J \cdot (-1)}.
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
Z = 2e^{3\beta J} + 6e^{-\beta J}.
\]

### Step 3: Match with the options
Comparing this result with the given options, we find that it matches **Option B**:

\[
Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta}.
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
