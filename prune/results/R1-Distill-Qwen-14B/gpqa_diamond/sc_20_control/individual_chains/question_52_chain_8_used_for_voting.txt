Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand all the details.

So the question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. Without any spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Hmm, wait, but why would the effective temperature change when spots are present? I remember that sunspots are cooler regions on the Sun, so when they cover part of the star's surface, the average temperature of the photosphere would decrease. So the star emits less total flux because a fraction of its surface is cooler.

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

Alright, so the problem gives the wavelength of the transition between these two levels as approximately 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet range. And we can assume the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so the Boltzmann equation applies for the level populations.

Let me recall the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by:

n2 / n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1) / (k T) )

Where:
- n2 and n1 are the populations of levels 2 and 1.
- g2 and g1 are the statistical weights (degeneracy) of the levels.
- E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels.
- k is Boltzmann's constant.
- T is the temperature.

But wait, the question says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when T decreases (from 6000 K to 5500 K), the ratio n2/n1 goes down. That makes sense because the exponential term becomes smaller when T decreases, since (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, making the exponent more negative, so the exp becomes smaller.

Wait, the ratio is level 1 to level 2? Because the problem says the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in level 1 and level 2 (I think). Let me check: the question says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So without spots (T=6000 K), the ratio is higher. So the ratio is n1/n2.

Wait no, the problem states: the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two levels (level 1 and 2) is observed to decrease when the star has spots. So, when T drops, n1/n2 increases or decreases? Or wait, the ratio is n1/n2. If when T decreases, the ratio n1/n2 increases, then when the star has spots, the ratio decreases? Not sure, perhaps I need to clarify.

Wait, when the temperature is lower, the exponent (E2 - E1)/(kT) is larger, so exp(- (E2-E1)/(kT)) is smaller. So if the ratio n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(kT) ), then when T decreases, n2/n1 decreases. So the ratio n1/n2 would be (g1/g2) * exp( ΔE/(k T) ). So when T decreases, exp(ΔE/(k T)) increases because denominator is smaller. So n1/n2 increases.

Wait, but the question says when the star has spots, the ratio n1/n2 (or is it n2/n1?) decreases. Wait, the exact wording is: "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2) decreases when the star has spots." So the ratio is n1/n2, and it decreases when spots are present. That would mean that when T decreases from 6000 to 5500, the ratio n1/n2 goes down. But according to the Boltzmann equation, if T decreases, n1/n2 would increase because the exponential term (exp(ΔE/(k T))) increases. So my earlier analysis might be conflicting with the given scenario. Did I get the ratio wrong?

Wait, perhaps the ratio is (n2)/(n1), which is the same as n2/n1. So when the star has spots, T decreases, and the ratio n2/n1 decreases. That makes sense because, as T decreases, the exponential term (which is in the numerator) decreases, so n2/n1 goes down. So without spots, when T is 6000 K, n2/n1 is higher. So the factor would be (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500.

Wait, but the question is about the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it does. So if the ratio is (n2/n1), then the factor is (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500.

So the factor is ( [ (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] ) / ( [ (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ] ) )

The g2/g1 terms cancel out. So the factor is exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] )

Wait, wait, let me recompute. The ratio is (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE = E2 - E1.

So the factor is:

Factor = (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500

= [ (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k*6000) ) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k*5500) ) ]

The (g2/g1) cancels, so:

Factor = exp( [ -ΔE/(k*6000) + ΔE/(k*5500) ] )

= exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/5500 - 1/6000 ] )

Let me compute the term inside the exponent:

First, compute 1/5500 -1/6000.

Find a common denominator, which is 5500*6000 = 33,000,000.

1/5500 = (6000/33,000,000) = 6/33,000,000? Wait, wait, no: 5500 * 6000 = 33,000,000.

So 1/5500 = 6000 / 33,000,000.

1/6000 = 5500 / 33,000,000.

So 1/5500 -1/6000 = (6000 -5500)/33,000,000 = 500 / 33,000,000 = 1 / 66,000.

Wait, 500 is 5 * 10^2, 33,000,000 is 3.3 * 10^7. So 500 / 33e6 = (5e2)/(3.3e7) = approx 0.00001515... So 1.515e-5.

Alternatively, 1/5500 ≈ 1.818e-4, 1/6000 ≈ 1.667e-4. The difference is about 0.00001515.

So the exponent becomes ΔE/(k) * (1/5500 -1/6000) = ΔE/(k) * 1.515e-5.

Wait, but I don't know ΔE. Hmm, but wait, the wavelength is given as 1448 Å. The energy difference between the two levels is related to the photon emitted when transitioning between them. So ΔE = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, and λ is the wavelength.

So ΔE = (6.626e-34 J s) * (3e8 m/s) ) / (1448e-10 m )

Let me compute this.

Compute hc/λ:

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

c = 3e8 m/s

λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 meters = 1.448e-7 m.

So hc = 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

So hc/λ = 1.9878e-25 / (1.448e-7) = approximately 1.373e-18 J.

But wait, that's the energy per photon. But in the Boltzmann equation, we have ΔE/(k T), so let's compute that term.

k is Boltzmann's constant: 1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE/(k) = (1.373e-18) / (1.38e-23) ) = approximately 9.956e4 ≈ 1e5.

Wait, that's roughly 1e5 K, since ΔE/(k) is in units of K.

Wait, let me compute more precisely.

Compute hc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

λ = 1.448e-7 m.

So hc/λ = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = (1.9878 / 1.448) * 1e-18 ≈ 1.373 * 1e-18 J.

So ΔE = 1.373e-18 J.

ΔE/(k) = 1.373e-18 J / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = (1.373 / 1.38) * 1e5 = approx 0.995 * 1e5 = 99500 ≈ 1e5 K.

So ΔE/(k) ≈ 1e5 K.

Wait, but in the exponent, it's ΔE/(k) multiplied by (1/5500 -1/6000) ≈ 1.515e-5.

So exponent is approximately (1e5 K) * (1.515e-5) ≈ 1.515.

So the exponent is about 1.515.

So the factor is exp(1.515) ≈ e^(1.515).

What's e^1.5? Approximately 4.48. e^0.015 is about 1.015. So 4.48 * 1.015 ≈ 4.54.

Wait, but let me compute e^1.515 more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it directly.

e^1.5 ≈ 4.4817.

e^1.515 = e^(1.5 + 0.015) = e^1.5 * e^0.015 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.0151 ≈ 4.4817 * (1 + 0.0151) ≈ 4.4817 + (4.4817 * 0.0151) = 4.4817 + 0.0677 ≈ 4.5494.

So approximately 4.55.

So the factor is approximately 4.55.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5, which is close.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake in some step.

Wait, so the factor is the ratio when without spots (6000 K) to when with spots (5500 K), so (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500.

Which is exp[ (1/5500 - 1/6000) * (hc/(k λ)) ) ].

Wait, another approach: Let me compute (1/5500 - 1/6000) in units of 1/K.

1/5500 = 1.818e-4 K^-1.

1/6000 ≈1.667e-4 K^-1.

The difference is 0.151e-4 K^-1 = 1.51e-5 K^-1.

Multiply by hc/(k λ) which is (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) * 1/(1.448e-7 m) ? Wait, no, I think I computed earlier that hc/(λ k) is approximately 1e5 K.

Wait, earlier, I think I computed (ΔE)/(k) as approximately 1e5 K.

So the exponent is (ΔE)/(k) * (1/5500 -1/6000) = (1e5 K) * (1.515e-5 K^-1) = 1.515.

So e^1.515 ≈4.55.

So the factor is about 4.55. So the correct option is C) ~4.5.

Wait, but the question is phrased as the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two levels. Let me make sure I haven't mixed up the levels. Because if the ratio is n1/n2, then when T drops, n1/n2 increases. So the factor would be (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500.

But in this case, the ratio is (n1/n2). So let me think:

Without spots, T=6000 K, ratio R = n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T)).

With spots, T=5500 K, ratio R' = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k *5500)).

So the factor is R / R' = exp(ΔE/(k T) - ΔE/(k T') ) where T=6000, T'=5500.

So factor = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T - 1/T') )

Which is the same as earlier: ΔE/(k) (1/6000 - 1/5500) = ΔE/(k) * (-1.515e-5 K^-1 )

So the exponent is negative, which would make the factor less than 1. But that's not the case because the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So if the factor is the ratio when without spots to when with spots, then factor is greater than 1.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the factor expression.

Let me reevaluate:

The factor is (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500 = [ (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k*6000)) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k*5500)) ) ]

The g's cancel, so:

= exp( ΔE/(k) ( 1/6000 - 1/5500 ) )

Which is exp( ΔE/(k) * (-1.515e-5) )

ΔE/(k) is about 1e5 K, so 1e5 * (-1.515e-5) = -1.515.

So the exponent is -1.515, so exp(-1.515) ≈ 0.220.

So the factor would be about 0.22, which is less than 1, implying that when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2) is higher than when it doesn't. But according to the problem statement, when there are spots, the ratio decreases. So this suggests that the ratio (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots, which would mean that the factor (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500 is greater than 1. But according to my calculation, it's about 0.22, which is less than 1.

Hmm, this is conflicting. Maybe I got the ratio the other way around.

Wait, the problem says: when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio is higher.

So if the ratio is (n1/n2), then when T increases, (n1/n2) increases because the exponent is positive. So when T increases (from 5500 to 6000), (n1/n2) increases.

So the factor is (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500 = exp( (1/6000 - 1/5500) * ΔE/(k) )

Which is exp( (ΔE/k) * (-1.515e-5) )

Which is exp( -1.515 ), which is about 0.22. So this would imply that when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio is 0.22 times lower than when it has spots. But the problem says when it has spots, the ratio is lower. So this doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio being discussed is (n2/n1). Let me consider that.

If the ratio is (n2/n1), then when T is higher (6000 K), (n2/n1) is higher. When T decreases to 5500 K, (n2/n1) decreases.

So the factor is (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500 = exp( (ΔE/k) [1/6000 -1/5500] )

Wait, no, let me compute it correctly.

(n2/n1) = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So the factor is [ (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k*6000)) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k*5500)) ) ]

= exp( -ΔE/(k*6000) + ΔE/(k*5500) )

= exp( ΔE/(k) ( 1/5500 - 1/6000 ) )

Same as before, which gives exp(1.515) ≈4.55.

So the factor is approximately 4.55, which is option C.

So the correct answer is C) ~4.5.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) under the influence of temperature changes. The star's effective temperature decreases from 6000 K (without spots) to 5500 K (with spots), and the ratio of the number of atoms in these levels decreases when the star has spots. The goal is to determine the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Boltzmann Equation**: The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by:
   \[
   \frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right)
   \]
   where \(g_1\) and \(g_2\) are the statistical weights, \(\Delta E = E_2 - E_1\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

2. **Energy Difference**: The energy difference \(\Delta E\) is related to the wavelength of the transition (\(\lambda\)) by:
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
   \]
   where \(h\) is Planck's constant and \(c\) is the speed of light. Substituting \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\), \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\), and \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}\), we find:
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
   \]

3. **Temperature Dependence**: The ratio of the number of atoms in the two levels depends on the temperature \(T\). The factor by which the ratio changes is:
   \[
   \text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{6000}}{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{5500}} = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k \cdot 6000}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k \cdot 5500}\right)} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000}\right)\right).
   \]

4. **Exponent Calculation**: Compute the term inside the exponent:
   \[
   \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = \frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \cdot 6000} = \frac{500}{33,000,000} \approx 1.515 \times 10^{-5}.
   \]
   Substituting \(\Delta E / k \approx 1 \times 10^5 \, \text{K}\) (from earlier calculations), the exponent becomes:
   \[
   \Delta E / k \cdot \left(\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000}\right) \approx (1 \times 10^5) \cdot (1.515 \times 10^{-5}) = 1.515.
   \]

5. **Final Factor**: The factor is:
   \[
   \exp(1.515) \approx 4.55.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels decreases by a factor of approximately 4.5 when the star transitions from a spotless state (6000 K) to a spotted state (5500 K). This matches option C.

Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand all the details.

So the question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. Without any spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Hmm, wait, but why would the effective temperature change when spots are present? I remember that sunspots are cooler regions on the Sun, so when they cover part of the star's surface, the average temperature of the photosphere would decrease. So the star emits less total flux because a fraction of its surface is cooler.

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

Alright, so the problem gives the wavelength of the transition between these two levels as approximately 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet range. And we can assume the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so the Boltzmann equation applies for the level populations.

Let me recall the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by:

n2 / n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1) / (k T) )

Where:
- n2 and n1 are the populations of levels 2 and 1.
- g2 and g1 are the statistical weights (degeneracy) of the levels.
- E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels.
- k is Boltzmann's constant.
- T is the temperature.

But wait, the question says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when T decreases (from 6000 K to 5500 K), the ratio n2/n1 goes down. That makes sense because the exponential term becomes smaller when T decreases, since (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, making the exponent more negative, so the exp becomes smaller.

Wait, the ratio is level 1 to level 2? Because the problem says the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in level 1 and level 2 (I think). Let me check: the question says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So without spots (T=6000 K), the ratio is higher. So the ratio is n1/n2.

Wait no, the problem states: the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two levels (level 1 and 2) is observed to decrease when the star has spots. So, when T drops, n1/n2 increases or decreases? Or wait, the ratio is n1/n2. If when T decreases, the ratio n1/n2 increases, then when the star has spots, the ratio decreases? Not sure, perhaps I need to clarify.

Wait, when the temperature is lower, the exponent (E2 - E1)/(kT) is larger, so exp(- (E2-E1)/(kT)) is smaller. So if the ratio n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(kT) ), then when T decreases, n2/n1 decreases. So the ratio n1/n2 would be (g1/g2) * exp( ΔE/(k T) ). So when T decreases, exp(ΔE/(k T)) increases because denominator is smaller. So n1/n2 increases.

Wait, but the question says when the star has spots, the ratio n1/n2 (or is it n2/n1?) decreases. Wait, the exact wording is: "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2) decreases when the star has spots." So the ratio is n1/n2, and it decreases when spots are present. That would mean that when T decreases from 6000 to 5500, the ratio n1/n2 goes down. But according to the Boltzmann equation, if T decreases, n1/n2 would increase because the exponential term (exp(ΔE/(k T))) increases. So my earlier analysis might be conflicting with the given scenario. Did I get the ratio wrong?

Wait, perhaps the ratio is (n2)/(n1), which is the same as n2/n1. So when the star has spots, T decreases, and the ratio n2/n1 decreases. That makes sense because, as T decreases, the exponential term (which is in the numerator) decreases, so n2/n1 goes down. So without spots, when T is 6000 K, n2/n1 is higher. So the factor would be (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500.

Wait, but the question is about the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it does. So if the ratio is (n2/n1), then the factor is (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500.

So the factor is ( [ (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] ) / ( [ (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ] ) )

The g2/g1 terms cancel out. So the factor is exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] )

Wait, wait, let me recompute. The ratio is (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE = E2 - E1.

So the factor is:

Factor = (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500

= [ (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k*6000) ) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k*5500) ) ]

The (g2/g1) cancels, so:

Factor = exp( [ -ΔE/(k*6000) + ΔE/(k*5500) ] )

= exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/5500 - 1/6000 ] )

Let me compute the term inside the exponent:

First, compute 1/5500 -1/6000.

Find a common denominator, which is 5500*6000 = 33,000,000.

1/5500 = (6000/33,000,000) = 6/33,000,000? Wait, wait, no: 5500 * 6000 = 33,000,000.

So 1/5500 = 6000 / 33,000,000.

1/6000 = 5500 / 33,000,000.

So 1/5500 -1/6000 = (6000 -5500)/33,000,000 = 500 / 33,000,000 = 1 / 66,000.

Wait, 500 is 5 * 10^2, 33,000,000 is 3.3 * 10^7. So 500 / 33e6 = (5e2)/(3.3e7) = approx 0.00001515... So 1.515e-5.

Alternatively, 1/5500 ≈ 1.818e-4, 1/6000 ≈ 1.667e-4. The difference is about 0.00001515.

So the exponent becomes ΔE/(k) * (1/5500 -1/6000) = ΔE/(k) * 1.515e-5.

Wait, but I don't know ΔE. Hmm, but wait, the wavelength is given as 1448 Å. The energy difference between the two levels is related to the photon emitted when transitioning between them. So ΔE = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, and λ is the wavelength.

So ΔE = (6.626e-34 J s) * (3e8 m/s) ) / (1448e-10 m )

Let me compute this.

Compute hc/λ:

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

c = 3e8 m/s

λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 meters = 1.448e-7 m.

So hc = 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

So hc/λ = 1.9878e-25 / (1.448e-7) = approximately 1.373e-18 J.

But wait, that's the energy per photon. But in the Boltzmann equation, we have ΔE/(k T), so let's compute that term.

k is Boltzmann's constant: 1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE/(k) = (1.373e-18) / (1.38e-23) ) = approximately 9.956e4 ≈ 1e5.

Wait, that's roughly 1e5 K, since ΔE/(k) is in units of K.

Wait, let me compute more precisely.

Compute hc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

λ = 1.448e-7 m.

So hc/λ = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = (1.9878 / 1.448) * 1e-18 ≈ 1.373 * 1e-18 J.

So ΔE = 1.373e-18 J.

ΔE/(k) = 1.373e-18 J / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = (1.373 / 1.38) * 1e5 = approx 0.995 * 1e5 = 99500 ≈ 1e5 K.

So ΔE/(k) ≈ 1e5 K.

Wait, but in the exponent, it's ΔE/(k) multiplied by (1/5500 -1/6000) ≈ 1.515e-5.

So exponent is approximately (1e5 K) * (1.515e-5) ≈ 1.515.

So the exponent is about 1.515.

So the factor is exp(1.515) ≈ e^(1.515).

What's e^1.5? Approximately 4.48. e^0.015 is about 1.015. So 4.48 * 1.015 ≈ 4.54.

Wait, but let me compute e^1.515 more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it directly.

e^1.5 ≈ 4.4817.

e^1.515 = e^(1.5 + 0.015) = e^1.5 * e^0.015 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.0151 ≈ 4.4817 * (1 + 0.0151) ≈ 4.4817 + (4.4817 * 0.0151) = 4.4817 + 0.0677 ≈ 4.5494.

So approximately 4.55.

So the factor is approximately 4.55.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5, which is close.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake in some step.

Wait, so the factor is the ratio when without spots (6000 K) to when with spots (5500 K), so (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500.

Which is exp[ (1/5500 - 1/6000) * (hc/(k λ)) ) ].

Wait, another approach: Let me compute (1/5500 - 1/6000) in units of 1/K.

1/5500 = 1.818e-4 K^-1.

1/6000 ≈1.667e-4 K^-1.

The difference is 0.151e-4 K^-1 = 1.51e-5 K^-1.

Multiply by hc/(k λ) which is (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) * 1/(1.448e-7 m) ? Wait, no, I think I computed earlier that hc/(λ k) is approximately 1e5 K.

Wait, earlier, I think I computed (ΔE)/(k) as approximately 1e5 K.

So the exponent is (ΔE)/(k) * (1/5500 -1/6000) = (1e5 K) * (1.515e-5 K^-1) = 1.515.

So e^1.515 ≈4.55.

So the factor is about 4.55. So the correct option is C) ~4.5.

Wait, but the question is phrased as the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two levels. Let me make sure I haven't mixed up the levels. Because if the ratio is n1/n2, then when T drops, n1/n2 increases. So the factor would be (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500.

But in this case, the ratio is (n1/n2). So let me think:

Without spots, T=6000 K, ratio R = n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T)).

With spots, T=5500 K, ratio R' = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k *5500)).

So the factor is R / R' = exp(ΔE/(k T) - ΔE/(k T') ) where T=6000, T'=5500.

So factor = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T - 1/T') )

Which is the same as earlier: ΔE/(k) (1/6000 - 1/5500) = ΔE/(k) * (-1.515e-5 K^-1 )

So the exponent is negative, which would make the factor less than 1. But that's not the case because the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So if the factor is the ratio when without spots to when with spots, then factor is greater than 1.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the factor expression.

Let me reevaluate:

The factor is (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500 = [ (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k*6000)) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k*5500)) ) ]

The g's cancel, so:

= exp( ΔE/(k) ( 1/6000 - 1/5500 ) )

Which is exp( ΔE/(k) * (-1.515e-5) )

ΔE/(k) is about 1e5 K, so 1e5 * (-1.515e-5) = -1.515.

So the exponent is -1.515, so exp(-1.515) ≈ 0.220.

So the factor would be about 0.22, which is less than 1, implying that when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2) is higher than when it doesn't. But according to the problem statement, when there are spots, the ratio decreases. So this suggests that the ratio (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots, which would mean that the factor (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500 is greater than 1. But according to my calculation, it's about 0.22, which is less than 1.

Hmm, this is conflicting. Maybe I got the ratio the other way around.

Wait, the problem says: when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio is higher.

So if the ratio is (n1/n2), then when T increases, (n1/n2) increases because the exponent is positive. So when T increases (from 5500 to 6000), (n1/n2) increases.

So the factor is (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500 = exp( (1/6000 - 1/5500) * ΔE/(k) )

Which is exp( (ΔE/k) * (-1.515e-5) )

Which is exp( -1.515 ), which is about 0.22. So this would imply that when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio is 0.22 times lower than when it has spots. But the problem says when it has spots, the ratio is lower. So this doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio being discussed is (n2/n1). Let me consider that.

If the ratio is (n2/n1), then when T is higher (6000 K), (n2/n1) is higher. When T decreases to 5500 K, (n2/n1) decreases.

So the factor is (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500 = exp( (ΔE/k) [1/6000 -1/5500] )

Wait, no, let me compute it correctly.

(n2/n1) = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So the factor is [ (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k*6000)) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k*5500)) ) ]

= exp( -ΔE/(k*6000) + ΔE/(k*5500) )

= exp( ΔE/(k) ( 1/5500 - 1/6000 ) )

Same as before, which gives exp(1.515) ≈4.55.

So the factor is approximately 4.55, which is option C.

So the correct answer is C) ~4.5.


To solve the problem, we analyze the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) under the influence of temperature changes. The star's effective temperature decreases from 6000 K (without spots) to 5500 K (with spots), and the ratio of the number of atoms in these levels decreases when the star has spots. The goal is to determine the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Boltzmann Equation**: The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by:
   \[
   \frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right)
   \]
   where \(g_1\) and \(g_2\) are the statistical weights, \(\Delta E = E_2 - E_1\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

2. **Energy Difference**: The energy difference \(\Delta E\) is related to the wavelength of the transition (\(\lambda\)) by:
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
   \]
   where \(h\) is Planck's constant and \(c\) is the speed of light. Substituting \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\), \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\), and \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}\), we find:
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
   \]

3. **Temperature Dependence**: The ratio of the number of atoms in the two levels depends on the temperature \(T\). The factor by which the ratio changes is:
   \[
   \text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{6000}}{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{5500}} = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k \cdot 6000}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k \cdot 5500}\right)} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000}\right)\right).
   \]

4. **Exponent Calculation**: Compute the term inside the exponent:
   \[
   \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = \frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \cdot 6000} = \frac{500}{33,000,000} \approx 1.515 \times 10^{-5}.
   \]
   Substituting \(\Delta E / k \approx 1 \times 10^5 \, \text{K}\) (from earlier calculations), the exponent becomes:
   \[
   \Delta E / k \cdot \left(\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000}\right) \approx (1 \times 10^5) \cdot (1.515 \times 10^{-5}) = 1.515.
   \]

5. **Final Factor**: The factor is:
   \[
   \exp(1.515) \approx 4.55.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels decreases by a factor of approximately 4.5 when the star transitions from a spotless state (6000 K) to a spotted state (5500 K). This matches option C.
