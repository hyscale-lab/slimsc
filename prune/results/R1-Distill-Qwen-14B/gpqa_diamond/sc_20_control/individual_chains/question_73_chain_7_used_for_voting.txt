Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, relativistic speeds, so I think I should be using Einstein's equations here, right?

Let me start by reading the question again. The astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction. The options are about the relative speed and the total energy.

Wait, so the first part is about the relative speed between them. I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, you can't just subtract them normally because that's only for non-relativistic speeds. Oh right, the relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula is something like (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c^2)). But wait, wait, in this case, both are moving in the same direction. So which one is u and which is v? I think u is the velocity of the second object as seen from the first's frame, or vice versa. Wait no, wait. Let me think. The velocities are 0.6c and 0.5c in the same direction, so from the perspective of the first astronaut (moving at 0.6c), what is the speed of the second astronaut?

So the second astronaut is moving at 0.5c relative to the lab frame, but from the first astronaut's frame, it's moving slower. Or wait, no, the frame of the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c relative to the lab. So the relative speed is (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c^2)). Let me compute that.

Wait, so the denominator is 1 - (0.6 * 0.5) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. The numerator is 0.1c. So 0.1 / 0.7 is approximately 0.1428c. So the relative speed is about 0.14c. That would match one of the options, looking at the choices.

Now, for the total energy. Each astronaut's energy is their rest mass energy times gamma. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for the first astronaut with mass 2m and speed 0.6c, gamma would be 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So their energy is 2m * c^2 * gamma = 2m * c^2 * 1.25 = 2.5 mc².

The second astronaut has mass 3m and speed 0.5c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So their energy is 3m * c^2 * 1.1547 ≈ 3 * 1.1547 mc² ≈ 3.464 mc².

Adding both energies: 2.5 + 3.464 = approximately 5.964 mc². So around 5.96 mc². Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option B says E=4.96 mc², which is lower. Option D says E=5mc², which is a bit lower than our calculation.

So combining the relative speed and energy, option C would be the right one. Let me check the options again.

Options:
C) v_rel = 0.14c , E=5.96 mc^2
Yes, that's what I calculated.

Wait, the question says "the total energy of the system." Hmm, but in relativity, energy isn't just the sum because from a different frame, the total might be different. But in the lab frame, each astronaut's energy is as I calculated, and the total would just be the sum. So that's correct.

So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c and the energy is about 5.96 mc². So the answer should be option C.

To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between the two astronauts, moving at relativistic speeds \( 0.6c \) and \( 0.5c \) in the same direction, is calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.6c \) and \( v = 0.5c \). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For the first astronaut (mass \( 2m \), speed \( 0.6c \)):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = 2m \cdot c^2 \cdot \gamma_1 = 2m \cdot c^2 \cdot 1.25 = 2.5mc^2
\]

For the second astronaut (mass \( 3m \), speed \( 0.5c \)):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = 3m \cdot c^2 \cdot \gamma_2 = 3m \cdot c^2 \cdot 1.1547 \approx 3.464mc^2
\]

Adding the two energies:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

### Conclusion
The relative speed is \( 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is approximately \( 5.96mc^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \), \( E = 5.96mc^2 \)**.

\[
E_2 = 3m \cdot c^2 \cdot \gamma_2 = 3m \cdot c^2 \cdot 1.1547 \approx 3.464mc^2
\]

Adding the two energies:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

### Conclusion
The relative speed is \( 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is approximately \( 5.96mc^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \), \( E = 5.96mc^2 \)**.
