Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my nuclear physics, but let me think. So the question is about the probability of an atom decaying, right?

So the setup is that we're observing a single atom. Wait, but I remember that the decay of an individual atom is a probabilistic event. So even if we know the probability over a certain time, each atom's decay is independent and we can't predict exactly when it will decay, only the probability over time.

The question says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, I think that relates to the half-life or the decay constant. Oh wait, maybe it's the probability of decaying within that time period. So if I have an atom, the chance it decays in 100 minutes is 32% or 0.32.

Wait, so the decay process follows an exponential law. The probability of decay is given by P = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant and t is time. Or wait, sometimes it's written as P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt). So the probability that the atom has decayed by time t is 1 minus the exponential term.

But wait, another way is that the survival probability is e^(-λt), so P(decayed) is 1 - e^(-λt). That makes sense.

In the problem, we're told that in 100 minutes, the probability is 32%, so 0.32. So we can set up the equation: 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100). Hmm, let's solve for λ.

So, 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100λ). Rearranging, e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking the natural log of both sides: -100λ = ln(0.68). So λ is (ln(0.68))/(-100).

Wait, ln(0.68) is a negative number, so when I divide by -100, λ becomes positive. Let me compute that. Let me think, what's ln(0.68)? I know that ln(1) is 0, ln(0.5) is about -0.693. Since 0.68 is a bit higher than 0.5, its ln would be a bit higher than -0.693. Let's approximate. Using a calculator, ln(0.68) is approximately -0.3857. So, λ = (0.3857) / 100 ≈ 0.003857 per minute.

Wait, actually, wait: let me check. Wait 0.68 is e^{-x}, so x is ln(1/0.68) = ln(1.47). Let me compute that. Hmm, wait, ln(1.47) is about 0.385, yes. So λ ≈ 0.003857 per minute.

Now, the current situation is that 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. So, we need to find the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes. Wait, does that mean 150 minutes from the start, or 150 minutes from now? Because the question says "the next 150 minutes," which I think refers to from the current time, which is 50 minutes after the start. So the total time from now is 150 minutes.

Wait, but wait, the initial condition is that 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed yet. So the probability we're looking for is the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=50+150=200 minutes.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased: "What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?" So, from the current moment, which is t=50, to t=200. So the time interval is 150 minutes.

But wait, the decay is a Poisson process, right? So the probability that the atom decays in a certain time interval is independent of when you start measuring. Wait, no, that applies to the rate, but the decay probability is dependent on the time elapsed since the start.

Wait, no, that's not accurate. Because the probability of decay in a time interval depends on the current time. So, the fact that 50 minutes have passed without decay affects the calculation.

Wait, but the decay process is memoryless. Oh wait, no, the decay process is memoryless. So the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50, is the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes from any point. Hmm, but wait, does that apply to the exponential decay? Yes, because the exponential distribution is memoryless.

Wait a minute, so the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed for the first 50, is equal to the probability it would have decayed in 150 minutes regardless of the previous time. Because the memoryless property says that the probability of an event happening in the next t units is the same as if you started the clock now.

So, in that case, the probability is the same as P(150), which is 1 - e^(-λ * 150).

Wait, but wait, because in the initial setup, we have P(100) = 0.32. So let's compute λ first.

We have P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^{-100λ}. So e^{-100λ} = 0.68. λ = -(ln(0.68))/100 ≈ 0.0038565 per minute.

So then, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is P(150) = 1 - e^{-150 λ}.

Let me compute e^{-150 * 0.0038565}.

Compute 150 * 0.0038565 = 0.578475.

So e^{-0.578475} ≈ ?

Hmm, e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, and e^-0.6 is about 0.5488. Let's think, 0.578475 is between 0.5 and 0.6, closer to 0.6.

Let me approximate: Let's compute ln(0.57) is not directly helpful. Alternatively, maybe use a Taylor expansion or calculator steps.

Wait, 0.578 is approximately 0.58. Let me see:

e^(-0.58) = 1/e^(0.58) ≈ 1/(1.785) ≈ 0.56. Because e^0.5 is 1.648, e^0.6 is 1.822. So 0.58 is 80% of the way from 0.5 to 0.6. So e^0.58 ≈ 1.785? Hmm, perhaps better to compute more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that ln(2) is about 0.693, so e^(-0.578) is approximately 0.562? Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps using the calculator approach. Let me compute 0.578.

e^0.578:

Let me compute in steps. Let me break it down.

We know that e^0.5 = 1.64872, e^0.6 ≈ 1.82211, e^0.578 is between these two.

Let me compute using the Taylor series for e^x around x=0.5.

But perhaps a better approach is to note that 0.578 is approximately 0.58.

Another approach: use the formula for e^x as 1 + x + x^2/2 + x^3/6 + ... but that might not be efficient here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation that e^0.578 ≈ 1.784 (I think I remember that e^0.578 ≈ 1.784). So e^(-0.578) ≈ 1/1.784 ≈ 0.561.

So, 1 - 0.561 = 0.439, or about 43.9%. Looking at the options, the closest is option A)44%, which is 44%.

So the probability is approximately 44%, so the answer should be A.

Wait, but wait another thing. The question says the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So the way we computed λ is correct, right? Let me double-check that.

Wait, 100 minutes: P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^{-λ * 100} → e^{-100λ} = 0.68 → λ = (ln(1/0.68))/100 → ln(1.47) ≈ 0.3856 → 0.3856 /100 = 0.003856 per minute.

Then for 150 minutes, the probability is 1 - e^{-λ*150} = 1 - e^{-0.003856 * 150}.

0.003856 *150 = 0.5784.

So e^-0.5784 ≈ 0.562 → 1 - 0.562 = 0.438 → ~43.8%, which is about 44%. So the answer is option A.

Wait, but some might think that since 50 minutes have already passed without decay, the remaining probability is 68% (because 1 - 0.32 = 0.68), and then the new probability would be 0.68 * something. But that's not the right approach, because the decay probabilities don't multiply like that. The correct approach is using the exponential function because the decay is a continuous process.

Alternatively, another approach is to calculate the probability that the atom has not decayed by 50 minutes, and then calculate the probability it decays in the next 150.

So, the survival probability after 50 minutes is e^{-λ *50} = e^{-(0.003856 *50)} = e^{-0.1928} ≈ 0.825. Because e^-0.2 is about 0.8187, so about 0.825.

Then, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the probability that it decays by 200 minutes minus the probability it decays by 50 minutes.

P(200) = 1 - e^{-λ*200}, P(50) = 0.175 (since 1 - e^{-λ*50}=0.175? No, wait earlier calculation: e^{-λ *50} is 0.825, so 1 - 0.825=0.175. So P(200) is 1 - e^{-0.003856 *200} = 1 - e^{-0.7712}.

e^{-0.7712} is approximately 0.463 (since e^-0.7 is about 0.4966, e^-0.77 is about 0.463. So 1 - 0.463 = 0.537. So the probability of decaying by 200 is 53.7%.

But the probability of decaying between 50 and 200 minutes is P(200) - P(50) = 0.537 - 0.175 = 0.362, which is 36.2%. But wait, that's conflicting with the earlier approach.

Wait, wait a minute. I must have made a mistake somewhere. Because the earlier approach using the memoryless property gives 43.8%, but this approach gives 36.2% which isn't among the options. So perhaps I did something wrong.

So where did I go wrong?

Wait, wait. Let me double-check the calculation. So P(50) is the probability of decay by 50 minutes. So P(50) = 1 - e^{-λ *50}.

With λ=0.003856, λ*50 is 0.1928. So e^{-0.1928} is about 0.825. So P(50) is about 0.175.

P(200) is 1 - e^{-λ*200} = 1 - e^{-0.7712}. e^-0.7712 is approximately 0.463, so P(200)=0.537.

So the probability of decaying between 50 and 200 minutes is 0.537 - 0.175 = 0.362, which is 36.2%. But that's not one of the options. Wait, the options are 44%, 40%, 52%, 48%.

So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, another way. Maybe the problem is that I'm using the wrong approach. Since the atom hasn't decayed in 50 minutes, the remaining probability is 1 - P(50) = 0.825. Now, the decay in the next 150 is the probability that it decays within that time. But because of the exponential nature, the time left is 150 minutes. So the probability is 1 - e^{-λ *150}.

Wait, but if the decay is memoryless, then regardless of the past, the probability of decaying in the next T minutes is 1 - e^{-λ T}.

So in this case, the probability is 1 - e^{-0.003856 *150} = 1 - e^{-0.5784} ≈ 1 - 0.562 = 0.438, which is 43.8%, which is option A.

But wait, why did the previous approach give a different result? Because I think the confusion arises from whether the 150 minutes is from the start or from the current time (50 minutes in). 

Wait, the question is: "the next 150 minutes." So from the current time (50 minutes after start), the next 150 minutes is 200 minutes total. So the probability is the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes. Which is P(200) - P(50).

But according to the memoryless property, this is equal to 1 - e^{-λ *150}.

Wait, is that correct? Because the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed yet, is the same as the probability it decays in 150 minutes starting now. So:

The conditional probability is P(decays between 50 and 200 | not decayed by 50) = [P(decays between 50 and 200)] / P(not decayed by 50).

Wait, no. Wait, when events are memoryless, the conditional probability P(A|B) is P(A). Because in the exponential distribution, the remaining time is the same as starting fresh.

Wait, no, let me think again. The probability that the atom decays within the next T minutes, given that it hasn't decayed for t minutes, is the same as the probability it decays within T minutes starting from time zero. So it's 1 - e^{-λ T}.

So the probability is 1 - e^{-λ *150} ≈ 0.438, which is 43.8%, so option A.

But earlier when I calculated P(200) - P(50) ≈ 0.537 - 0.175 = 0.362, that's about 36.2%, which doesn't match. So that suggests that I'm making a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of e^-0.7712. Let me compute it more accurately.

Compute e^-0.7712:

We can compute it using a calculator more accurately. Alternatively, note that:

ln(0.463) ≈ -0.771, so e^-0.771 is approximately 0.463. So P(200) is 1 - 0.463 = 0.537.

P(50) is 1 - e^-0.1928 ≈ 1 - 0.825 = 0.175.

So, between 50 and 200 minutes, the probability is 0.537 - 0.175 = 0.362, which is 36.2%.

But wait, that's conflicting with the memoryless approach, which gives 43.8%. So there must be an error in my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is whether the decay probability is 32% in 100 minutes, which is the same as the half-life being 100 minutes? No, because 32% is less than 50%, so that's not the half-life.

Wait, let me think again. The half-life is the time taken for half the atoms to decay. The decay constant λ is related to the half-life t_1/2 by λ = ln(2)/t_1/2.

Wait, but in this problem, the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%, which is less than the half-life (which would be 50% at t= t_1/2). So 32% is less than half, so the half-life must be longer than 100 minutes.

Wait, but perhaps I should approach the problem differently. Let me go back.

We know that P(t) = 1 - e^{-λ t} = 0.32 when t=100. So we can find λ as (ln(1/(1-0.32)))/100 = ln(1/0.68)/100 ≈ ln(1.47)/100 ≈ 0.3856/100 = 0.003856 per minute.

Now, the question is, after 50 minutes, the atom hasn't decayed. What's the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes (i.e., from 50 to 200 minutes)?

Because of the memoryless property, the probability of decaying in the next T minutes is the same as the probability of decaying within T minutes from any starting point. So the probability is 1 - e^{-λ T}, where T=150.

So, 1 - e^{-(0.003856)(150)} = 1 - e^{-0.5784}.

Compute e^-0.5784:

We can compute this more accurately. Let me think about it: ln(0.56) is approximately -0.5798. Because ln(0.56) = ln(56/100) = ln(14/25) ≈ -0.5798. So e^-0.5798 ≈ 0.56.

So, 0.5784 is a bit higher than 0.5798, so e^-0.5784 is a bit higher than 0.56.

Wait, no, because as x increases, e^-x decreases. So, 0.5784 is larger than 0.5798? No, 0.5784 is 0.5784, and 0.5798 is larger. So 0.5784 is less than 0.5798. So e^-0.5784 is larger than e^-0.5798.

Wait, because e^-x decreases as x increases. So if x is 0.5784, which is less than 0.5798, e^-0.5784 is larger than e^-0.5798. So if e^-0.5798 is 0.56, e^-0.5784 would be slightly larger, say 0.561 or 0.562.

So 1 - 0.561 = 0.439, or 43.9%, which is approximately 44%.

So the correct answer should be option A.

But wait, earlier when I calculated the probability between 50 and 200 minutes as 36.2%, why is there a discrepancy?

Ah, I think I see the mistake. Because the question says that the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. So the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that it decays in 150 minutes starting now. So the correct approach uses the memoryless property, and thus gives 43.8%, so option A.

Wait, but when I calculated P(200) - P(50) = 0.537 - 0.175 = 0.362, that's about 36.2%. But that would imply that the probability is 36%, which isn't an option. So why is there a discrepancy?

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in my calculator steps. Let me recompute P(200) and P(50) more accurately.

Compute λ = ln(1.47)/100 ≈ 0.3856/100 = 0.003856 per minute.

Compute P(50) = 1 - e^{-0.003856 *50} = 1 - e^{-0.1928}.

What's e^-0.1928?

Using a calculator, e^-0.1928 ≈ 0.825, so P(50) = 0.175.

P(200) = 1 - e^{-0.003856 *200} = 1 - e^{-0.7712}.

What is e^-0.7712?

Let me compute it more accurately. Let's use the Taylor series around x=0.7.

e^x ≈ 1 + x + x²/2 + x³/6.

But perhaps a better approach is to use a calculator approximation.

Alternatively, I can note that ln(0.46) ≈ -0.776, so e^-0.776 ≈ 0.46. So e^-0.7712 is a bit larger than 0.46.

Let me compute: e^-0.7712 = 1 / e^{0.7712}.

Compute e^0.7712.

We know that e^0.7 is about 2.01375, e^0.77 is about 2.159. Let me compute e^0.7712 more accurately.

0.7712 = 0.7 + 0.0712.

e^0.7 = 2.01375.

e^0.0712 ≈ 1 + 0.0712 + (0.0712^2)/2 + (0.0712^3)/6.

0.0712^2 = 0.00507, /2 = 0.002535.

0.0712^3 = 0.000362, /6 ≈ 0.0000603.

So e^0.0712 ≈ 1 + 0.0712 + 0.002535 + 0.0000603 ≈ 1.0738.

So e^0.7712 = e^(0.7 + 0.0712) ) = e^0.7 * e^0.0712 ≈ 2.01375 * 1.0738 ≈ 2.159.

So e^-0.7712 ≈ 1 / 2.159 ≈ 0.463.

So P(200) = 1 - 0.463 = 0.537.

So the probability of decaying between 50 and 200 minutes is 0.537 - 0.175 = 0.362, or 36.2%.

But this contradicts the memoryless approach which gives 43.8%.

Wait, but that can't be. Wait, perhaps the initial assumption that the decay is memoryless is incorrect in this context. Wait, no, exponential decay processes are memoryless. So the probability of decaying in the next T minutes is 1 - e^{-λ T}, regardless of previous time.

So why is there a discrepancy when computing the difference between P(200) and P(50)?

Wait a second, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the way I'm calculating the probabilities. Because P(200) is the probability that the atom has decayed by 200 minutes, and P(50) is the probability it has decayed by 50 minutes.

But when the atom hasn't decayed by 50 minutes, the probability of it decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of it decaying within 150 minutes starting now, which is 1 - e^{-λ *150}.

Which gives 0.438, and that's the correct approach.

So why is the calculation of P(200) - P(50) giving 36.2%? Because that's the probability that it decays between 50 and 200, but this isn't the same as the conditional probability given that it hasn't decayed by 50.

Wait, right! Because the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 is not the same as the conditional probability given that it hasn't decayed by 50. The conditional probability is [P(decays between 50 and 200)] / [P(not decayed by 50)].

So the correct conditional probability is (P(200) - P(50)) / (1 - P(50)).

Which is (0.537 - 0.175) / (1 - 0.175) = (0.362) / (0.825) ≈ 0.439, which is 43.9%, which matches the earlier result.

Ah, that makes sense now.

So the calculation is: (P(200) - P(50)) / (1 - P(50)) = (0.537 - 0.175) / 0.825 ≈ 0.362 / 0.825 = 0.439, or 43.9%, so option A.

Therefore, the correct answer is A)44%.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the radioactive decay process, which follows an exponential law. The probability of an atom decaying by time \( t \) is given by:

\[
P(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
\]

where \( \lambda \) is the decay constant. From the problem, we know that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, or \( P(100) = 0.32 \). Using this, we can solve for \( \lambda \):

\[
0.32 = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 100}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 0.68
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\lambda \cdot 100 = \ln(0.68)
\]

\[
\lambda = \frac{-\ln(0.68)}{100}
\]

Using \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.3856 \), we find:

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{0.3856}{100} \approx 0.003856 \, \text{per minute}.
\]

Next, we need to calculate the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, given that 50 minutes have already passed without decay. Due to the memoryless property of exponential decay, the probability of decaying in the next \( T \) minutes depends only on \( T \), not on the elapsed time. Thus, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is:

\[
P_{\text{decay}} = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}
\]

Substituting \( \lambda \approx 0.003856 \) and \( T = 150 \):

\[
\lambda \cdot 150 = 0.003856 \cdot 150 \approx 0.5784
\]

\[
P_{\text{decay}} = 1 - e^{-0.5784}
\]

Using approximations for \( e^{-0.5784} \), we find:

\[
e^{-0.5784} \approx 0.562
\]

\[
P_{\text{decay}} \approx 1 - 0.562 = 0.438 \, \text{or} \, 43.8\%.
\]

Thus, the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes is approximately **44%**, which corresponds to option A.

Answer: A

Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my nuclear physics, but let me think. So the question is about the probability of an atom decaying, right?

So the setup is that we're observing a single atom. Wait, but I remember that the decay of an individual atom is a probabilistic event. So even if we know the probability over a certain time, each atom's decay is independent and we can't predict exactly when it will decay, only the probability over time.

The question says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, I think that relates to the half-life or the decay constant. Oh wait, maybe it's the probability of decaying within that time period. So if I have an atom, the chance it decays in 100 minutes is 32% or 0.32.

Wait, so the decay process follows an exponential law. The probability of decay is given by P = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant and t is time. Or wait, sometimes it's written as P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt). So the probability that the atom has decayed by time t is 1 minus the exponential term.

But wait, another way is that the survival probability is e^(-λt), so P(decayed) is 1 - e^(-λt). That makes sense.

In the problem, we're told that in 100 minutes, the probability is 32%, so 0.32. So we can set up the equation: 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100). Hmm, let's solve for λ.

So, 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100λ). Rearranging, e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking the natural log of both sides: -100λ = ln(0.68). So λ is (ln(0.68))/(-100).

Wait, ln(0.68) is a negative number, so when I divide by -100, λ becomes positive. Let me compute that. Let me think, what's ln(0.68)? I know that ln(1) is 0, ln(0.5) is about -0.693. Since 0.68 is a bit higher than 0.5, its ln would be a bit higher than -0.693. Let's approximate. Using a calculator, ln(0.68) is approximately -0.3857. So, λ = (0.3857) / 100 ≈ 0.003857 per minute.

Wait, actually, wait: let me check. Wait 0.68 is e^{-x}, so x is ln(1/0.68) = ln(1.47). Let me compute that. Hmm, wait, ln(1.47) is about 0.385, yes. So λ ≈ 0.003857 per minute.

Now, the current situation is that 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. So, we need to find the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes. Wait, does that mean 150 minutes from the start, or 150 minutes from now? Because the question says "the next 150 minutes," which I think refers to from the current time, which is 50 minutes after the start. So the total time from now is 150 minutes.

Wait, but wait, the initial condition is that 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed yet. So the probability we're looking for is the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=50+150=200 minutes.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased: "What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?" So, from the current moment, which is t=50, to t=200. So the time interval is 150 minutes.

But wait, the decay is a Poisson process, right? So the probability that the atom decays in a certain time interval is independent of when you start measuring. Wait, no, that applies to the rate, but the decay probability is dependent on the time elapsed since the start.

Wait, no, that's not accurate. Because the probability of decay in a time interval depends on the current time. So, the fact that 50 minutes have passed without decay affects the calculation.

Wait, but the decay process is memoryless. Oh wait, no, the decay process is memoryless. So the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50, is the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes from any point. Hmm, but wait, does that apply to the exponential decay? Yes, because the exponential distribution is memoryless.

Wait a minute, so the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed for the first 50, is equal to the probability it would have decayed in 150 minutes regardless of the previous time. Because the memoryless property says that the probability of an event happening in the next t units is the same as if you started the clock now.

So, in that case, the probability is the same as P(150), which is 1 - e^(-λ * 150).

Wait, but wait, because in the initial setup, we have P(100) = 0.32. So let's compute λ first.

We have P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^{-100λ}. So e^{-100λ} = 0.68. λ = -(ln(0.68))/100 ≈ 0.0038565 per minute.

So then, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is P(150) = 1 - e^{-150 λ}.

Let me compute e^{-150 * 0.0038565}.

Compute 150 * 0.0038565 = 0.578475.

So e^{-0.578475} ≈ ?

Hmm, e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, and e^-0.6 is about 0.5488. Let's think, 0.578475 is between 0.5 and 0.6, closer to 0.6.

Let me approximate: Let's compute ln(0.57) is not directly helpful. Alternatively, maybe use a Taylor expansion or calculator steps.

Wait, 0.578 is approximately 0.58. Let me see:

e^(-0.58) = 1/e^(0.58) ≈ 1/(1.785) ≈ 0.56. Because e^0.5 is 1.648, e^0.6 is 1.822. So 0.58 is 80% of the way from 0.5 to 0.6. So e^0.58 ≈ 1.785? Hmm, perhaps better to compute more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that ln(2) is about 0.693, so e^(-0.578) is approximately 0.562? Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps using the calculator approach. Let me compute 0.578.

e^0.578:

Let me compute in steps. Let me break it down.

We know that e^0.5 = 1.64872, e^0.6 ≈ 1.82211, e^0.578 is between these two.

Let me compute using the Taylor series for e^x around x=0.5.

But perhaps a better approach is to note that 0.578 is approximately 0.58.

Another approach: use the formula for e^x as 1 + x + x^2/2 + x^3/6 + ... but that might not be efficient here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation that e^0.578 ≈ 1.784 (I think I remember that e^0.578 ≈ 1.784). So e^(-0.578) ≈ 1/1.784 ≈ 0.561.

So, 1 - 0.561 = 0.439, or about 43.9%. Looking at the options, the closest is option A)44%, which is 44%.

So the probability is approximately 44%, so the answer should be A.

Wait, but wait another thing. The question says the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So the way we computed λ is correct, right? Let me double-check that.

Wait, 100 minutes: P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^{-λ * 100} → e^{-100λ} = 0.68 → λ = (ln(1/0.68))/100 → ln(1.47) ≈ 0.3856 → 0.3856 /100 = 0.003856 per minute.

Then for 150 minutes, the probability is 1 - e^{-λ*150} = 1 - e^{-0.003856 * 150}.

0.003856 *150 = 0.5784.

So e^-0.5784 ≈ 0.562 → 1 - 0.562 = 0.438 → ~43.8%, which is about 44%. So the answer is option A.

Wait, but some might think that since 50 minutes have already passed without decay, the remaining probability is 68% (because 1 - 0.32 = 0.68), and then the new probability would be 0.68 * something. But that's not the right approach, because the decay probabilities don't multiply like that. The correct approach is using the exponential function because the decay is a continuous process.

Alternatively, another approach is to calculate the probability that the atom has not decayed by 50 minutes, and then calculate the probability it decays in the next 150.

So, the survival probability after 50 minutes is e^{-λ *50} = e^{-(0.003856 *50)} = e^{-0.1928} ≈ 0.825. Because e^-0.2 is about 0.8187, so about 0.825.

Then, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the probability that it decays by 200 minutes minus the probability it decays by 50 minutes.

P(200) = 1 - e^{-λ*200}, P(50) = 0.175 (since 1 - e^{-λ*50}=0.175? No, wait earlier calculation: e^{-λ *50} is 0.825, so 1 - 0.825=0.175. So P(200) is 1 - e^{-0.003856 *200} = 1 - e^{-0.7712}.

e^{-0.7712} is approximately 0.463 (since e^-0.7 is about 0.4966, e^-0.77 is about 0.463. So 1 - 0.463 = 0.537. So the probability of decaying by 200 is 53.7%.

But the probability of decaying between 50 and 200 minutes is P(200) - P(50) = 0.537 - 0.175 = 0.362, which is 36.2%. But wait, that's conflicting with the earlier approach.

Wait, wait a minute. I must have made a mistake somewhere. Because the earlier approach using the memoryless property gives 43.8%, but this approach gives 36.2% which isn't among the options. So perhaps I did something wrong.

So where did I go wrong?

Wait, wait. Let me double-check the calculation. So P(50) is the probability of decay by 50 minutes. So P(50) = 1 - e^{-λ *50}.

With λ=0.003856, λ*50 is 0.1928. So e^{-0.1928} is about 0.825. So P(50) is about 0.175.

P(200) is 1 - e^{-λ*200} = 1 - e^{-0.7712}. e^-0.7712 is approximately 0.463, so P(200)=0.537.

So the probability of decaying between 50 and 200 minutes is 0.537 - 0.175 = 0.362, which is 36.2%. But that's not one of the options. Wait, the options are 44%, 40%, 52%, 48%.

So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, another way. Maybe the problem is that I'm using the wrong approach. Since the atom hasn't decayed in 50 minutes, the remaining probability is 1 - P(50) = 0.825. Now, the decay in the next 150 is the probability that it decays within that time. But because of the exponential nature, the time left is 150 minutes. So the probability is 1 - e^{-λ *150}.

Wait, but if the decay is memoryless, then regardless of the past, the probability of decaying in the next T minutes is 1 - e^{-λ T}.

So in this case, the probability is 1 - e^{-0.003856 *150} = 1 - e^{-0.5784} ≈ 1 - 0.562 = 0.438, which is 43.8%, which is option A.

But wait, why did the previous approach give a different result? Because I think the confusion arises from whether the 150 minutes is from the start or from the current time (50 minutes in). 

Wait, the question is: "the next 150 minutes." So from the current time (50 minutes after start), the next 150 minutes is 200 minutes total. So the probability is the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes. Which is P(200) - P(50).

But according to the memoryless property, this is equal to 1 - e^{-λ *150}.

Wait, is that correct? Because the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed yet, is the same as the probability it decays in 150 minutes starting now. So:

The conditional probability is P(decays between 50 and 200 | not decayed by 50) = [P(decays between 50 and 200)] / P(not decayed by 50).

Wait, no. Wait, when events are memoryless, the conditional probability P(A|B) is P(A). Because in the exponential distribution, the remaining time is the same as starting fresh.

Wait, no, let me think again. The probability that the atom decays within the next T minutes, given that it hasn't decayed for t minutes, is the same as the probability it decays within T minutes starting from time zero. So it's 1 - e^{-λ T}.

So the probability is 1 - e^{-λ *150} ≈ 0.438, which is 43.8%, so option A.

But earlier when I calculated P(200) - P(50) ≈ 0.537 - 0.175 = 0.362, that's about 36.2%, which doesn't match. So that suggests that I'm making a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of e^-0.7712. Let me compute it more accurately.

Compute e^-0.7712:

We can compute it using a calculator more accurately. Alternatively, note that:

ln(0.463) ≈ -0.771, so e^-0.771 is approximately 0.463. So P(200) is 1 - 0.463 = 0.537.

P(50) is 1 - e^-0.1928 ≈ 1 - 0.825 = 0.175.

So, between 50 and 200 minutes, the probability is 0.537 - 0.175 = 0.362, which is 36.2%.

But wait, that's conflicting with the memoryless approach, which gives 43.8%. So there must be an error in my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is whether the decay probability is 32% in 100 minutes, which is the same as the half-life being 100 minutes? No, because 32% is less than 50%, so that's not the half-life.

Wait, let me think again. The half-life is the time taken for half the atoms to decay. The decay constant λ is related to the half-life t_1/2 by λ = ln(2)/t_1/2.

Wait, but in this problem, the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%, which is less than the half-life (which would be 50% at t= t_1/2). So 32% is less than half, so the half-life must be longer than 100 minutes.

Wait, but perhaps I should approach the problem differently. Let me go back.

We know that P(t) = 1 - e^{-λ t} = 0.32 when t=100. So we can find λ as (ln(1/(1-0.32)))/100 = ln(1/0.68)/100 ≈ ln(1.47)/100 ≈ 0.3856/100 = 0.003856 per minute.

Now, the question is, after 50 minutes, the atom hasn't decayed. What's the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes (i.e., from 50 to 200 minutes)?

Because of the memoryless property, the probability of decaying in the next T minutes is the same as the probability of decaying within T minutes from any starting point. So the probability is 1 - e^{-λ T}, where T=150.

So, 1 - e^{-(0.003856)(150)} = 1 - e^{-0.5784}.

Compute e^-0.5784:

We can compute this more accurately. Let me think about it: ln(0.56) is approximately -0.5798. Because ln(0.56) = ln(56/100) = ln(14/25) ≈ -0.5798. So e^-0.5798 ≈ 0.56.

So, 0.5784 is a bit higher than 0.5798, so e^-0.5784 is a bit higher than 0.56.

Wait, no, because as x increases, e^-x decreases. So, 0.5784 is larger than 0.5798? No, 0.5784 is 0.5784, and 0.5798 is larger. So 0.5784 is less than 0.5798. So e^-0.5784 is larger than e^-0.5798.

Wait, because e^-x decreases as x increases. So if x is 0.5784, which is less than 0.5798, e^-0.5784 is larger than e^-0.5798. So if e^-0.5798 is 0.56, e^-0.5784 would be slightly larger, say 0.561 or 0.562.

So 1 - 0.561 = 0.439, or 43.9%, which is approximately 44%.

So the correct answer should be option A.

But wait, earlier when I calculated the probability between 50 and 200 minutes as 36.2%, why is there a discrepancy?

Ah, I think I see the mistake. Because the question says that the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. So the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that it decays in 150 minutes starting now. So the correct approach uses the memoryless property, and thus gives 43.8%, so option A.

Wait, but when I calculated P(200) - P(50) = 0.537 - 0.175 = 0.362, that's about 36.2%. But that would imply that the probability is 36%, which isn't an option. So why is there a discrepancy?

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in my calculator steps. Let me recompute P(200) and P(50) more accurately.

Compute λ = ln(1.47)/100 ≈ 0.3856/100 = 0.003856 per minute.

Compute P(50) = 1 - e^{-0.003856 *50} = 1 - e^{-0.1928}.

What's e^-0.1928?

Using a calculator, e^-0.1928 ≈ 0.825, so P(50) = 0.175.

P(200) = 1 - e^{-0.003856 *200} = 1 - e^{-0.7712}.

What is e^-0.7712?

Let me compute it more accurately. Let's use the Taylor series around x=0.7.

e^x ≈ 1 + x + x²/2 + x³/6.

But perhaps a better approach is to use a calculator approximation.

Alternatively, I can note that ln(0.46) ≈ -0.776, so e^-0.776 ≈ 0.46. So e^-0.7712 is a bit larger than 0.46.

Let me compute: e^-0.7712 = 1 / e^{0.7712}.

Compute e^0.7712.

We know that e^0.7 is about 2.01375, e^0.77 is about 2.159. Let me compute e^0.7712 more accurately.

0.7712 = 0.7 + 0.0712.

e^0.7 = 2.01375.

e^0.0712 ≈ 1 + 0.0712 + (0.0712^2)/2 + (0.0712^3)/6.

0.0712^2 = 0.00507, /2 = 0.002535.

0.0712^3 = 0.000362, /6 ≈ 0.0000603.

So e^0.0712 ≈ 1 + 0.0712 + 0.002535 + 0.0000603 ≈ 1.0738.

So e^0.7712 = e^(0.7 + 0.0712) ) = e^0.7 * e^0.0712 ≈ 2.01375 * 1.0738 ≈ 2.159.

So e^-0.7712 ≈ 1 / 2.159 ≈ 0.463.

So P(200) = 1 - 0.463 = 0.537.

So the probability of decaying between 50 and 200 minutes is 0.537 - 0.175 = 0.362, or 36.2%.

But this contradicts the memoryless approach which gives 43.8%.

Wait, but that can't be. Wait, perhaps the initial assumption that the decay is memoryless is incorrect in this context. Wait, no, exponential decay processes are memoryless. So the probability of decaying in the next T minutes is 1 - e^{-λ T}, regardless of previous time.

So why is there a discrepancy when computing the difference between P(200) and P(50)?

Wait a second, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the way I'm calculating the probabilities. Because P(200) is the probability that the atom has decayed by 200 minutes, and P(50) is the probability it has decayed by 50 minutes.

But when the atom hasn't decayed by 50 minutes, the probability of it decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of it decaying within 150 minutes starting now, which is 1 - e^{-λ *150}.

Which gives 0.438, and that's the correct approach.

So why is the calculation of P(200) - P(50) giving 36.2%? Because that's the probability that it decays between 50 and 200, but this isn't the same as the conditional probability given that it hasn't decayed by 50.

Wait, right! Because the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 is not the same as the conditional probability given that it hasn't decayed by 50. The conditional probability is [P(decays between 50 and 200)] / [P(not decayed by 50)].

So the correct conditional probability is (P(200) - P(50)) / (1 - P(50)).

Which is (0.537 - 0.175) / (1 - 0.175) = (0.362) / (0.825) ≈ 0.439, which is 43.9%, which matches the earlier result.

Ah, that makes sense now.

So the calculation is: (P(200) - P(50)) / (1 - P(50)) = (0.537 - 0.175) / 0.825 ≈ 0.362 / 0.825 = 0.439, or 43.9%, so option A.

Therefore, the correct answer is A)44%.


To solve the problem, we analyze the radioactive decay process, which follows an exponential law. The probability of an atom decaying by time \( t \) is given by:

\[
P(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
\]

where \( \lambda \) is the decay constant. From the problem, we know that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, or \( P(100) = 0.32 \). Using this, we can solve for \( \lambda \):

\[
0.32 = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 100}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 0.68
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\lambda \cdot 100 = \ln(0.68)
\]

\[
\lambda = \frac{-\ln(0.68)}{100}
\]

Using \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.3856 \), we find:

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{0.3856}{100} \approx 0.003856 \, \text{per minute}.
\]

Next, we need to calculate the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, given that 50 minutes have already passed without decay. Due to the memoryless property of exponential decay, the probability of decaying in the next \( T \) minutes depends only on \( T \), not on the elapsed time. Thus, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is:

\[
P_{\text{decay}} = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}
\]

Substituting \( \lambda \approx 0.003856 \) and \( T = 150 \):

\[
\lambda \cdot 150 = 0.003856 \cdot 150 \approx 0.5784
\]

\[
P_{\text{decay}} = 1 - e^{-0.5784}
\]

Using approximations for \( e^{-0.5784} \), we find:

\[
e^{-0.5784} \approx 0.562
\]

\[
P_{\text{decay}} \approx 1 - 0.562 = 0.438 \, \text{or} \, 43.8\%.
\]

Thus, the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes is approximately **44%**, which corresponds to option A.

Answer: A
