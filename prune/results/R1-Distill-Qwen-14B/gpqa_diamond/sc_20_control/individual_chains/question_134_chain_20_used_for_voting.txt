Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. It's about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and a base are mixed. Hmm, I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. Enthalpy of neutralization is typically the heat released when one mole of an acid reacts with one mole of a base.

Wait, but wait, the problem gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Oh, right, when you mix them, they'll react. But I need to think about how much of each is reacting with the others. Also, I should probably calculate the moles of each acid and base first.

Let me jot down the given data:

HCl: 500 mL of 0.2 M. So moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles.

H2SO4: 300 mL of 0.3 M. Moles would be 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09. Wait, wait, no, wait. H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, meaning each molecule can donate two H+ ions. So when it reacts with a base, it would contribute two equivalents per mole. Hmm, but for neutralization, each mole of H2SO4 can neutralize two moles of OH-.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL of 0.5 M. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each mole provides two OH- ions because the formula is Ba(OH)2, right? So each mole gives 2 moles of OH-.

So the reaction when these are mixed should be an acid-base reaction. Let me think about the overall reaction.

HCl is a strong acid, H2SO4 is a strong acid as well, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So when they mix, the H+ from the acids will react with the OH- from the base.

But wait, the problem is about calculating enthalpy of neutralization. I think the neutralization here would involve all the acidic H+ from the acids reacting with the OH- from the base. The enthalpy of neutralization is usually per mole of H+ reacting with OH-.

But wait, perhaps I should calculate the total moles of H+ and total moles of OH- and see which is the limiting reactant.

Let me compute that.

First, HCl: it's a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Each mole gives one H+. So moles of H+ from HCl = 0.1 mol.

H2SO4: it's a diprotic strong acid, so each mole gives two H+. So moles of H+ from H2SO4 = 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol.

So total H+ from acids = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

Now, Ba(OH)2: each mole gives two OH-. So moles of OH- = 0.5 * 0.2 * 2 = 0.2 mol. Because the molarity is 0.5, volume is 0.2 L, so 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 mol OH-.

So now, the H+ is 0.28 mol, OH- is 0.2 mol. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. The enthalpy change for this is usually around -57.3 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-), but wait, I think the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57.3 kJ per mole of H+ (i.e., per mole of acid reacting, assuming 1:1).

Wait, actually, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is often taken as -57.3 kJ/mol when one mole of H+ from an acid reacts with one mole of OH- from a base to form water. So if all the OH- is used up, the enthalpy change would be based on the moles of OH- times that number.

Wait, but in this case, the OH- is 0.2 mol. So the maximum H+ that can react is 0.2 mol. But the total H+ available is 0.28 mol. So the OH- is the limiting reagent here, meaning that all 0.2 mol OH- will react, consuming 0.2 mol H+.

So the reaction would produce 0.2 mol H2O, releasing 0.2 * 57.3 kJ, which is 11.46 kJ. But wait, the question is asking for enthalpy of neutralization. Oh wait, but wait, no. The standard neutralization enthalpy is per mole of H+ reacting. So 0.2 moles of H+ reacting would release 0.2 * (-57.3) kJ, which is -11.46 kJ.

But wait, looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, wait a minute, the units are mixed. Oh, because 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ. Let me check the options again.

Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is more than my calculated 11.46, so that can't be. Option B is in kcal, so I need to convert my result to kcal.

Wait, let me recalculate. The reaction is 0.2 mol H+ reacting with 0.2 mol OH- to form 0.2 mol H2O. The enthalpy change is 0.2 mol * (-57.3 kJ/mol) = -11.46 kJ. To convert kJ to kcal, since 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ, then 11.46 kJ /4.184 ≈ 2.736 kcal. So the enthalpy is -2.736 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal. That's very close to my calculation.

Wait, but wait another thing. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so each mole provides two OH- ions. But in the reaction, each mole of OH- reacts with a mole of H+.

So the calculation I did seems correct. The limiting reagent is OH-.

Another thing: The enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and strong bases is considered to be approximately -57.3 kJ/mol. So when 0.2 moles of H+ react, it's 0.2 *57.3 = 11.46 kJ, which is 11.46 kJ. But the options have option D as -16.0 kJ, which is higher. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that each mole of H2SO4 contributes 2 H+ and each mole of HCl contributes 1 H+. Hmm, but the limiting reagent is the OH-.

Wait, let me redo the calculations.

Moles of H+ from HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 M = 0.1 mol. Since HCl is H+ and Cl-.

Moles of H2SO4: 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 mol. Each gives 2 H+, so 0.18 mol H+.

Total H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L * 0.5 M = 0.1 mol. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 mol OH-.

So OH- is 0.2 mol. So the H+ will be consumed by 0.2 mol. So the H+ that's unreacted is 0.08 mol, but that's irrelevant.

So the reaction is 0.2 mol H+ + 0.2 mol OH- → 0.2 mol H2O.

Enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ.

Wait, but the options don't have -11.46 kJ. Oh wait, looking back, option B is -11.42 kcal. So let's convert 11.46 kJ to kcal.

11.46 kJ ÷ 4.184 kJ/kcal ≈ 2.736 kcal. So approximately 2.74 kcal. The option with -2.72 kcal is A. Hmm, close.

But why is option B so close to 11.42 kJ? Because 11.42 kJ is approximately 2.73 kcal. Wait, but wait, 11.42 kJ would be 11.42 /4.184 ≈ 2.725 kcal. So about 2.73 kcal.

Wait, but the calculation is 0.2 *57.3=11.46 kJ. So 11.46 kJ is about 2.736 kcal. So option A is -2.72 kcal. That's close.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the enthalpy per mole of reaction is different? Or perhaps the problem is considering the total moles of acid and base.

Wait, another approach: The total moles of H+ from all acids is 0.28, and OH- is 0.2. So 0.28 H+ and 0.2 OH-.

The neutralization reaction consumes 0.2 H+ and 0.2 OH-, producing 0.2 H2O. So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * 57.3 kJ = 11.46 kJ, which is 11.46 kJ. But if the question is asking for per mole, perhaps it's referring to the stoichiometric quantities.

Wait, but the question says "Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization". Enthalpy of neutralization is usually given per mole of acid or base. But in this case, it's a mixture of two acids and a base. So perhaps the approach is to find the net H+ and OH- and compute the overall enthalpy change.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the neutralization to involve each acid and base, but that seems more complicated.

Wait, another thought: The neutralization of H2SO4 is a two-step process. The first H+ might be neutralized, but the second may not be if OH- is limiting.

Wait, but in this problem, the presence of multiple acids complicates things. Let me think: The H+ from HCl and H2SO4 are all available, since both are strong acids and will dissociate completely.

So the total H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

The OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.2 mol.

So the OH- will neutralize 0.2 mol H+. So the total H+ consumed is 0.2 mol, and the amount of H+ remaining is 0.08 mol.

But for the enthalpy of neutralization, the total heat released is 0.2 * 57.3 kJ = 11.46 kJ. So that's 11.46 kJ, which is about 11.46 kJ, but the options don't have this value. Wait, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the moles of H+ and OH- and see the difference.

Wait, another angle: Could the problem involve the neutralization of each acid separately? Like, HCl reacts with half the OH- and H2SO4 reacts with the other half?

No, because the OH- is a common reactant for all H+.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the moles of each acid and base, and see which is in excess.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a base. So the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

So the limiting reagent is the OH- (0.2 mol), so all of it will react, consuming 0.2 mol H+.

So the total H+ consumed is 0.2 mol.

So the total enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ.

But none of the options have that value. Let me look again.

The options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

Wait, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is approximately 11.42 kcal. Let me convert that to kJ: 11.42 kcal *4.184 kJ/kcal ≈ 47.64 kJ. That's way higher than my calculated 11.46 kJ.

Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher than our calculation. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles.

Wait, let me calculate each mole again.

HCl: 500 mL = 0.5 L. 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL = 0.3 L. 0.3 L *0.3 mol/L =0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL =0.2 L. 0.2 L *0.5 mol/L=0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So, correct.

Another thought: Could the enthalpy of neutralization for H2SO4 be different? Because H2SO4 is diprotic, but when the first H+ is neutralized, the second may require more energy because the solution is now with a sulfate ion, which is a weaker acid.

Wait, but in the case of enthalpy of neutralization, for strong acids, the second H+ is also considered to have the same enthalpy as the first.

Wait, but wait, for H2SO4, the first dissociation is complete, but the second is not. But since H2SO4 is a strong acid, both H+ ions are released in solution. So in the case of neutralization, all the H+ from H2SO4 would react with OH-.

But perhaps the enthalpy per mole of H2SO4 is different. Wait, but in the context of the problem, the enthalpy of neutralization is the same for each H+ ion.

Wait, no, I think the standard enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of H+.

So 0.28 mol H+ and 0.2 mol OH-.

So the reaction is 0.2 mol H+ + 0.2 mol OH- → 0.2 mol H2O.

Entirely, the enthalpy is 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the question is phrased incorrectly, or perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, looking at the options again. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is about 16 kJ. How could that happen?

Wait, perhaps I should account for the fact that Ba(OH)2 is a dihydroxide. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 provides two moles of OH-. So the moles of OH- are 0.2. But wait, that's what I did before.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of acid and base.

Wait, but HCl is a monoprotic acid, H2SO4 is diprotic, and Ba(OH)2 is diprotic base.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the neutralization per mole of each reactant.

Hmm, that complicates things. Let me think: The neutralization would occur as:

H+ from all acids reacting with OH- from the base.

So, HCl (0.1 mol) → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4 (0.09 mol) → 0.18 H+.

Total H+ = 0.28 mol.

Ba(OH)2 (0.1 mol) → 0.2 OH-.

So, the OH- is the limiting reagent, so all OH- will react, consuming 0.2 H+.

So, the total H+ consumed is 0.2, and the remaining is 0.08.

The enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ.

But none of the options match 11.46 kJ. Wait, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the enthalpy per mole of H+. Wait, perhaps it's -57.3 kJ per mole of H2O formed. Wait, no, the standard is per mole of H+.

Wait, another thought: The problem says 'enthalpy of neutralization when ... are mixed.' Maybe the total solution's volume is considered, but the calculation is based on moles.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting the calculation of the total moles of H+ and OH- and then the excess H+.

Wait, but that wouldn't change the enthalpy calculation, because only the neutralized part contributes.

Wait, maybe the question is considering the neutralization per mole of each acid and base, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different enthalpy value, like -44 kJ per mole for H+ (I'm not sure, as I thought it's -57.3 kJ per mole). But if it were -44, then 0.2 * (-44) = -8.8 kJ, which still doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the fact that the neutralization of H2SO4 would release more heat because of the two H+ ions.

Wait, but in that case, the calculation would be the same as I did before.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the enthalpy per mole of solution, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the solution is considering the dilution, but no, the enthalpy of neutralization is a molar quantity, irrespective of the concentration.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the heat released in kJ and then see which option is closest.

11.46 kJ is approximately 11.5 kJ, but none of the options match. Wait, option B is -11.42 kcal. So let me compute 11.42 kcal in kJ.

11.42 kcal * 4.184 ≈ 47.7 kJ. That's way higher than 11.46 kJ.

So that can't be right. Hmm.

Wait, I think I must have made a mistake in calculations. Let me recheck.

Wait, wait: Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^-.

So moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol. So OH- is 0.2 mol.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol. Since H2SO4 is diprotic, 0.18 H+.

Total H+: 0.28 mol.

OH-: 0.2 mol.

So OH- is the limiting reagent. So 0.2 H+ and 0.2 OH- neutralize, releasing 0.2 *57.3 = 11.46 kJ. So that's 11.46 kJ, which is about -11.46 kJ. But the options don't have that.

Wait, looking at the options again:

A) -2.72 kcal → ~ 11.46 kJ is about 2.736 kcal, so -2.736 kcal is close to option A.

Wait, no, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is about 11.36 kJ. That's close to 11.46, maybe accounting for rounding.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation should be done more precisely.

Let me compute 0.2 *57.3 = 11.46 kJ. To convert to kcal: 11.46 /4.184 ≈ 2.736 kcal. So approximately -2.74 kcal. The option A is -2.72 kcal, which is very close.

So the correct answer should be option A.

But why isn't option B matching? Because option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about 47.6 kJ, which is way too high.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let's think again about the stoichiometry.

Wait, in neutralization, each H+ reacts with an OH- to form water. The enthalpy for that is -57.3 kJ per mole of H+.

So, in this case, 0.2 moles of H+ reacting, so 0.2 *57.3 = 11.46 kJ.

So 11.46 kJ is the total enthalpy change, which is approximately 2.736 kcal (as earlier).

So the correct option would be A) -2.72 kcal.

But the presented options are:

A) -2.72 kcal → ~ 11.36 kJ

B) -11.42 kcal → ~47.64 kJ

D) -16.0 kJ.

Hmm, none matching exactly, but A is the closest to our calculation.

Another possibility: Could the problem have mixed up kJ and kcal in the options?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization, such as -56.9 kJ per mole, which is sometimes the value used.

So 0.2 *56.9 = 11.38 kJ → 11.38 /4.184 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So that would align with option A.

So that makes sense. So the correct answer is A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are taken:

1. **Calculate moles of H⁺ from acids:**
   - **HCl:**  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Since HCl is monoprotic, moles of H⁺ = 0.1 mol.
   - **H₂SO₄:**  
     Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Since H₂SO₄ is diprotic, moles of H⁺ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).
   - **Total H⁺ from acids:**  
     \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Calculate moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂:**  
   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Since Ba(OH)₂ is diprotic, moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

3. **Determine the limiting reactant:**  
   The reaction is \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \to \text{H₂O} \).  
   - Total H⁺ available = 0.28 mol.  
   - Total OH⁻ available = 0.2 mol.  
   OH⁻ is the limiting reactant, as it will neutralize 0.2 mol of H⁺.

4. **Calculate the enthalpy change:**  
   The enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is approximately \( -57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) per mole of H⁺.  
   - Moles of H⁺ neutralized = 0.2 mol.  
   - Enthalpy change = \( 0.2 \times (-57.3) = -11.46 \, \text{kJ} \).

5. **Convert to kcal (if necessary):**  
   Since \( 1 \, \text{kcal} = 4.184 \, \text{kJ} \),  
   \( -11.46 \, \text{kJ} \div 4.184 \, \text{kJ/kcal} \approx -2.736 \, \text{kcal} \).

6. **Compare with options:**  
   - **Option A (-2.72 kcal):** Closest to the calculated value of \( -2.736 \, \text{kcal} \).  
   - **Option B (-11.42 kcal):** Incorrect, as it corresponds to \( 47.64 \, \text{kJ} \), which is far too high.  
   - **Option C (-3.80 kcal):** Incorrect, as it does not match the calculation.  
   - **Option D (-16.0 kJ):** Incorrect, as it is higher than the calculated \( -11.46 \, \text{kJ} \).

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A (-2.72 kcal)**.

Answer: A
