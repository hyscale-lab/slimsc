Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I need to figure out which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. Let's break it down.

I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that extends the Standard Model by adding higher-dimensional operators. These operators are organized by their dimension, like dimension 6, 7, 8, etc. The idea is that these operators are suppressed by some high energy scale, usually denoted as Λ, so their effects are not significant at lower energies.

The question is about symmetries. The options given are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. I need to figure out which of these must be respected by all the operators in SMEFT.

Wait, what's the difference between Lorentz and Poincare symmetry? I think Lorentz symmetry includes rotations and boosts, while Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (like momentum conservation). So Poincare is a bigger symmetry group. But wait, in SMEFT, the operators are constructed in such a way that they respect the Standard Model's symmetries. So if the Standard Model respects Lorentz symmetry, then SMEFT operators should too. But what about Poincare?

Hmm, Poincare symmetry includes momentum conservation. Operators in SMEFT are local, so they should respect momentum conservation, which is part of Poincare. But wait, are all operators in SMEFT automatically Poincare invariant? I think that SMEFT is built as a Lorentz-invariant theory, which is part of being a relativistic theory. But does that automatically ensure Poincare invariance? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Maybe if the theory respects special relativity, which includes Lorentz and translation symmetries, then it would have Poincare symmetry. So I think that SMEFT would respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries, so options 1 and 2 are correct.

Now, what about CP and CPT symmetries? The Standard Model is CP symmetric, but some of its extensions like the CKM model can have CP violation. Wait, the SMEFT includes all possible higher-dimensional operators that are consistent with the Standard Model's gauge symmetry. So if the Standard Model (SM) doesn't enforce CP symmetry, then SMEFT can include operators that violate CP as well. Wait, but wait: I think the effective operators are built by adding terms that are allowed by the SM gauge symmetry. So if the SM includes CP violation, then the SMEFT can include such terms. So the operators in SMEFT don't necessarily have to preserve CP symmetry. Therefore, the operators don't have to respect CP symmetry. So option 3 is not necessarily a must.

But wait, what about CPT symmetry? CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory, combining charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal. In the Standard Model, CPT is respected. So any effective theory built from the SM should also respect CPT. Because the SMEFT is an effective theory that extends the SM, I think it must respect CPT symmetry as well. So option 4 must be respected.

So the symmetries that must be respected are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question is which must be respected by all operators. So if an operator violates CP, that's allowed as long as it doesn't violate CPT. Because CPT is more fundamental. Wait, but let me think: can SMEFT include operators that violate CP but preserve CPT? Or is that possible?

Hmm, wait. For instance, the CKM matrix in the Standard Model violates CP, but the theory still respects CPT because the violation is CP, not CPT. But I'm not sure if SMEFT allows operators that violate CPT. Because in the Standard Model, CPT is a symmetry, so SMEFT should also respect CPT. So any operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry. So 4 is correct.

So putting it all together, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT.

Looking back at the options:

Option C is 1,2,4. So that would be correct.

Wait, but wait, what about Poincare symmetry. Do SMEFT operators necessarily respect Poincare symmetry? Because Poincare includes translations. The operators in SMEFT are local, so they should respect momentum conservation, which is part of Poincare. So yes, they must respect that.

So the correct symmetries are 1,2,4. So the correct option is C.

The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is an extension of the Standard Model (SM) that includes higher-dimensional operators suppressed by a high energy scale, Λ. These operators are constructed to respect the symmetries of the SM while incorporating new physics at higher energies. The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: This symmetry, which includes rotations and boosts, is fundamental to relativistic quantum field theories. Since SMEFT is a relativistic effective theory, it must respect Lorentz symmetry. Therefore, this symmetry is required.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations (e.g., momentum conservation). SMEFT operators are local and respect momentum conservation, which is part of Poincaré symmetry. Thus, Poincaré symmetry must also be respected.

3. **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry combines charge conjugation and parity. While the SM respects CP symmetry in most cases, CP violation is allowed in certain extensions of the SM (e.g., through the CKM matrix). SMEFT operators can include terms that violate CP symmetry as long as they are consistent with the SM gauge symmetry. Therefore, CP symmetry is not necessarily required to be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry, which combines charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal, is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory. Since the SM respects CPT symmetry, SMEFT, as an effective theory extending the SM, must also respect CPT symmetry. Thus, this symmetry is required.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). The correct option is:
