Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy. Hmm, let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the setup: there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right, which is about 1.6e-19 coulombs. And their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. 

The system is isolated, so no external fields or anything. The way the charges are arranged: 12 of them are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from point P. And the 13th charge is fixed at P. So, point P is where one charge is, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P.

Wait, so the 12 charges are each 2 meters away from P. Are they all at the same point, 2 meters away? Or are they arranged around P in some way? I guess the exact arrangement doesn't matter for potential energy because electric potential energy depends only on distances between pairs. But wait, no, the way the charges are arranged in space affects the potential energy, but in this problem, since all the 12 are at 2m from P, maybe the system is symmetric. So perhaps all the 12 are at the same distance from the fixed charge. 

Wait, no. Let me think: the fixed charge is at point P. The 12 others are each at 2m from P. So the 12 are all at 2m from P, but their mutual distances could vary. But in terms of potential energy, we're considering pairs of charges. So the total potential energy will be the sum of the potential energies of each pair.

So, the problem is asking for the minimum energy of the system. Hmm. Wait, but how do I find the minimum energy? Oh wait, perhaps I need to consider all the interactions between the charges.

Wait, so each of the 12 charges is at 2m from P. But each of these 12 can also interact with each other. So I need to calculate the potential energy between the fixed charge and each of the 12, plus the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges.

But wait, the charge at P is fixed, so it's not moving. So the other 12 are each 2m away and maybe they're all fixed as well? Or are the 12 constrained to stay at 2m but free to move around each other? Hmm, the problem says they're "constrained to stay at 2m from P". So their positions are fixed at 2m from P, but they might be arranged in some other way, perhaps. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify their arrangement beyond being 2m from P. So perhaps they are all at the same point 2m away from P. But that would make the potential energy between them very high because all are close together. Alternatively, perhaps they're arranged in a way that their mutual distances are as large as possible, minimizing the potential energy between them. Because the system is isolated, the potential energy can be calculated based on the configuration.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum energy of the system. So perhaps the configuration that minimizes the potential energy is when the 12 charges are arranged as far apart as possible. But wait, they're all constrained to be 2m from point P. So if they're all at 2m from P, their arrangement would be on the surface of a sphere with radius 2m. To minimize the potential energy between themselves, they should be as spread out as possible on that sphere, right? Because if they are all bunched together, the potential energy would be higher due to the closer proximity of the charges.

But wait, the problem is asking for the minimum energy, so perhaps we're supposed to assume that the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that the mutual repulsion is minimized. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply considering only the interactions between the 12 charges and the fixed charge at P, and not considering their mutual interactions. Hmm, but that doesn't sound right because for a system of multiple charges, the total potential energy includes all pairs.

Wait, let me think again. The problem states that the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So each of these 12 is at 2m from P. So the fixed charge at P is interacting with each of the 12. So the potential energy from those interactions is 12 times the energy between a single charge at 2m and the fixed charge.

But then, the 12 charges are each at some arrangement on the surface of a sphere of radius 2m. Their mutual potential energies depend on the distances between them. To find the minimum total potential energy of the system, perhaps we need to arrange them in such a way that the mutual potential energies are as negative as possible. Wait, but wait: potential energy between two positive charges is positive because they repel. So if I have two charges, each +2e, the potential energy between them is positive. So arranging them as far apart as possible would minimize (make the potential energy as negative as possible? No, wait, no. Because it's repulsion, so the potential energy is positive. To minimize the total potential energy, you want to make the sum of all the potential energies as small as possible. Since each pair contributes a positive amount (because they are like charges), you want to arrange them so that this sum is as small as possible, i.e., the charges are as far apart as possible. So arranging them equally spaced on a sphere would minimize the sum of their mutual potential energies.

But without knowing the exact positions, perhaps the problem is simplifying and only considering the potential energies between the fixed charge and the 12 others. Let me re-read the problem.

The question says: What is the minimum energy of this system correct to three decimals? So I think the key is to compute the total potential energy of the system.

So, the total potential energy U is the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges. So, for the 13th charge (fixed at P) and each of the 12 others, and between each pair of the 12 others.

Wait, but since the 12 are all at 2m from P, the potential energy between the fixed charge and each of the 12 is (2e)*(2e)/(4πε₀ * 2m). And for each of the 12, that's 12 times that value.

Then, the potential energy between each pair of the 12 is (2e)*(2e)/(4πε₀ * d_ij), where d_ij is the distance between the ith and jth of the 12. But since all 12 are at 2m from P and their positions are on a sphere, the distance between any two charges depends on their angular separation. To find the minimum total potential energy, I need to arrange them such that the sum of all these U_ij is minimized.

Wait, but what's the minimal value of that sum? The sum would be minimized when each pair is as far apart as possible. But given that they're on a sphere, the maximum distance between any two would be 4m (diametrically opposite points). But arranging all 12 to be as far apart as possible is the configuration that gives the minimal sum of potential energies because each term in the sum is positive and as small as possible.

Wait, but wait, no. Because potential energy between two positive charges is positive. So to minimize the total, we need to minimize the sum of positive terms. So yes, arranging the 12 as far apart as possible would make each U_ij as small as possible, hence the total sum is minimized.

But wait, how can 12 charges be arranged on a sphere to maximize the distances between them? Well, for a sphere, the most symmetric arrangement is the vertices of a regular polyhedron. For 12 points, I'm not sure which regular polyhedron that would be, but perhaps it's not necessary to know the exact arrangement because the problem might be assuming that the mutual potential energy is zero or negligible, or perhaps it's not part of the calculation. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the potential energy between the fixed charge and the 12 others, and not the mutual potential between the 12. But that seems unlikely because the problem states that it's an isolated system, so all interactions should be considered.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again.

"12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P."

So, the 12 are each at 2m from P. But their mutual distances are not specified. So, perhaps the problem is assuming that the mutual potential energies are negligible, or perhaps the 12 are arranged in such a way that their mutual distances are the same as 2m, but that can't be right because if all 12 are at 2m from P, their mutual distances would vary. Or perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the fixed charge and the others, and not between the others. Hmm, but that's probably not correct.

Wait, but if all 12 are at 2m from P, but their mutual distances are 2m, that would only be possible if they're all on the same point, which would make the potential energy between them very high. But that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are not considered, and the problem is just asking for the potential energy between the fixed charge and the 12 others. Because otherwise, the problem becomes more complicated as we need to find the minimal configuration of 12 charges on a sphere, which could be beyond the scope of an introductory problem.

Wait, but the options given are all very small numbers in the order of 1e-26 to 1e-27 J. So perhaps the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges is negligible compared to the potential energy between each of them and the fixed charge.

But wait, let me compute both contributions and see.

So, first, the potential energy between the fixed charge at P and each of the 12 charges.

Each charge is 2e, at 2m. So the potential energy for each pair is (2e)^2 / (4πε₀ * 2m) * (1/(4πε₀)).

Wait, no, wait: the potential energy U between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law: U = (k_e * q1 * q2)/r, where k_e is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988e9 N·m²/C². Alternatively, sometimes written as 1/(4πε₀).

So, for each of the 12 charges, the potential energy between the fixed charge (2e) and another charge (2e) at 2m is U = (2e)(2e)/(4πε₀ * 2m) = (4e²)/(4πε₀ * 2m) = (e²)/(4πε₀ m) * 2.

Wait, let me compute that. So, each such pair contributes U_i = (2e)(2e)/(4πε₀ * 2m) = (4 e²)/(4 π ε₀ * 2 m) = (4 e²)/(8 π ε₀ m) = e²/(2 π ε₀ m).

Wait, but since 1/(4πε₀) is k_e, which is approximately 8.988e9 N·m²/C². So perhaps I can compute e²/(4πε₀ a) where a is 2m.

But perhaps it's better to compute it numerically.

Let me compute each term:

e = 1.6e-19 C.

So e² = (1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38 C².

The distance r is 2 m.

So for each pair between the fixed charge and a moving charge, the potential energy is U = (2e)(2e)/(4πε₀ * 2m) = (4 e²) / (8 π ε₀ m) ) since 4πε₀ * 2m = 8 π ε₀ m. So U = (4e²) / (8 π ε₀ m) ) = e²/(2 π ε₀ m).

Wait, no, wait: 4e² divided by (4πε₀ * 2m) is (4e²)/(8 π ε₀ m) = e²/(2 π ε₀ m).

Then, since there are 12 such charges, the total potential energy from these interactions is 12 * (e²/(2 π ε₀ m)).

Wait, no, because each of the 12 contributes U = (2e)^2/(4πε_0 * 2m) = (4e²)/(8 π ε_0 m) ) = e²/(2 π ε_0 m). So for 12 charges, that's 12 * (e²/(2 π ε_0 m)) = 6 e²/(π ε_0 m).

Wait, perhaps I should compute this numerically.

Alternatively, using k_e = 1/(4πε_0) ≈ 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So U for one pair is (2e)(2e) * k_e / (2m) = (4e²) * k_e / (2m) = 2 e² k_e / m.

Wait, no: wait, U = (q1 q2) / (4πε_0 r) ), so U = (2e)(2e) / (4πε_0 * 2m) ) = (4 e²) / (8 π ε_0 m) ) = e²/(2 π ε_0 m).

Which is the same as (e²) * (1/(2 π ε_0 m) ).

But 1/(4πε_0) is k_e = 8.988e9. So perhaps I can express it as:

e²/(2 π ε_0 m) = (e²/(4 π ε_0)) ) * (2 / (m)) ), but maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the value step by step.

Compute e²/(4 π ε_0 m) first.

Wait, e²/(4 π ε_0) is (e^2) * k_e, which is a quantity often used in physics. Let's compute e²/(4 π ε_0) in joules.

e = 1.6e-19 C.

e² = 2.56e-38 C².

k_e = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So e² * k_e = 2.56e-38 * 8.988e9 = approx 2.56 * 8.988 = approx 23.023e-29 = 2.3023e-28 J·m.

Wait, no, wait: the unit would be (C²) * (N·m²/C²) ) = N·m². Hmm, but that's not directly helpful. Maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute U for one pair.

So U for one pair: (2e)(2e) * k_e / (2m) = (4 e²) * k_e / (2m) = (2 e² k_e)/m.

Wait, that would be U = 2 e² k_e / m.

Wait, e² is 2.56e-38 C².

k_e is 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So e² k_e = 2.56e-38 * 8.988e9 = let's compute that: 2.56 * 8.988 ≈ 23.02, 1e-38 * 1e9 = 1e-29. So 23.02e-29 = 2.302e-28.

Then, U for one pair is (2 * 2.302e-28) / 2m. Wait, no, wait: U = 2 e² k_e / m. So 2 * 2.302e-28 / m.

Wait, m is the distance, which is 2 meters.

So U = 2 * 2.302e-28 / 2 = 2.302e-28 J.

Wait, no. Wait, e² k_e = 2.302e-28 J·m? Not sure. Let me recompute.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me compute the value step by step.

Compute U for one pair:

U = (2e)(2e) * k_e / r.

r is 2m. So,

U = (4e²) * (8.988e9) / 2.

So,

e² = (1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38 C².

So,

4e² = 4 * 2.56e-38 = 1.024e-37 C².

Multiply by k_e (8.988e9 N·m²/C²):

1.024e-37 * 8.988e9 = let's compute 1.024 * 8.988 ≈ 9.18, then 1e-37 * 1e9 = 1e-28. So 9.18e-28 N·m².

Then divide by r, which is 2m: 9.18e-28 / 2 = 4.59e-28 J.

So that's the potential energy for one pair between the fixed charge and a moving charge.

Since there are 12 such charges, the total potential energy from these interactions is 12 * 4.59e-28 = 55.08e-28 J. Which is 5.508e-27 J.

Now, that's just the potential energy between the fixed charge and the 12 others. But what about the potential energy between the 12 moving charges themselves?

Each pair among the 12 contributes a potential energy. The number of pairs is C(12,2) = 66. So 66 pairs.

Each pair has a potential energy of (2e)(2e) * k_e / d_ij, where d_ij is the distance between the ith and jth moving charge.

But what's d_ij? Since all the moving charges are at a distance of 2m from P, their mutual distances depend on their positions on the sphere of radius 2m. To minimize the total potential energy, we want the sum of all these U_ij to be as small as possible (because U_ij is positive, so making each U_ij as small as possible (i.e., as large as possible d_ij) would minimize the sum).

The minimal sum occurs when all the 12 charges are as far apart as possible on the sphere. The maximum possible distance between any two points on a sphere is 4m (diametrically opposite). However, arranging 12 points on a sphere to maximize minimal distances is non-trivial. For example, the vertices of a regular icosahedron are arranged to maximize symmetry, but I'm not sure about the exact distances.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the mutual distances are all 2m. But that's not possible because if all 12 are at 2m from P, their mutual distance can't all be 2m unless they're all at the same point, which would make the potential energy between them extremely high. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the mutual potential energy is negligible, but that seems unlikely because each pair contributes positively.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the mutual potential energy between the 12 moving charges, considering only the potential energy between each of them and the fixed charge. Because otherwise, the problem becomes more complicated, and perhaps the mutual potential energy is not intended to be considered.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is considered, assuming that the 12 charges are arranged in some optimal way, but without knowing the exact configuration, it's impossible to compute.

Hmm, but wait, the problem asks for the minimum energy of the system. So perhaps the mutual potential energy is being considered, and the minimal configuration is when the charges are as spread out as possible, meaning that each pair is as far apart as possible, thereby minimizing the sum of their mutual potential energies.

But without knowing the exact distances, perhaps there's an assumption here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the mutual potential energy, and only consider the potential energy between the fixed charge and the 12 others.

Let me think about the options.

The options are:

A) 5.645 x 10^-26 J

B) 2.822 x 10^-26 J

C) 7.056 x 10^-27 J

D) 122.330 J

Wait, when I computed the potential energy between the fixed charge and the 12 others, I got 5.508e-27 J. But that's only the fixed charge contribution. The mutual contributions from the 12 charges would add more to the potential energy, making the total higher. So if the mutual potential energy is not considered, the total is about 5.5e-27, which is close to option C (7.056e-27), but not exactly. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recompute the fixed charge contribution more accurately.

Each pair between fixed and moving:

U = (2e)(2e) * k_e / (2m) )

Which is 4e² * k_e / (2m) = 2e² k_e / m.

Wait, e=1.6e-19 C, so e²=2.56e-38 C².

k_e=8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So 2e² k_e = 2 * 2.56e-38 * 8.988e9 = 2 * (2.56 * 8.988) e-29.

Compute 2.56 * 8.988:

2.56 * 8 = 20.48, 2.56 * 0.988≈ 2.527. So total around 23.007.

Multiply by 2: 46.014.

So 46.014e-29 = 4.6014e-28 J.

Since this is for each of the 12 charges, total is 12 * 4.6014e-28 = 55.2168e-28 = 5.52168e-27 J.

Which is approximately 5.52e-27 J. But none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me redo it.

Compute 4e² * k_e / (2 m):

e²= (1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38 C².

4e² = 1.024e-37 C².

Multiply by k_e: 1.024e-37 * 8.988e9 = let's compute:

1.024 * 8.988 ≈ 9.18.

Exponents: 1e-37 * 1e9 = 1e-28.

So 9.18e-28 J·m.

Divide by 2m: 9.18e-28 / 2 = 4.59e-28 J per pair.

Twelve pairs: 12 * 4.59e-28 = 55.08e-28 J =5.508e-27 J.

So about 5.508e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27 J, which is a bit higher. Option B is 2.822e-26, which is about 5 times higher.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to account for the mutual potential energy between the moving charges. So let's compute that.

Each pair of the 12 moving charges has a potential energy of (2e)(2e) * k_e / d_ij.

Assuming that all the 12 are arranged on a sphere of radius 2m, and to minimize the sum of U_ij, they should be as far apart as possible. The maximum possible distance on the sphere is 4m (diametrically opposite).

But in reality, arranging 12 points on a sphere to maximize the minimal distance between any two is a known problem, but I'm not sure about the exact arrangement. However, perhaps the problem is assuming that the moving charges are all at the same distance from each other, say 2m, but that can't be because 12 points can't all be 2m apart from each other when they're on a sphere of radius 2m.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are all 2m, which would imply that each pair is 2m apart. But that's only possible if all the 12 charges are at the same point, which is impossible as that would mean the charges are all at the same location, leading to a much higher potential energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are the same as the distance from P, which is 2m. So each charge is 2m from P and their mutual distances are also 2m. But that's only possible in a very specific arrangement, perhaps a regular polygon or something, but in 3D space, maybe a regular polyhedron.

Wait, but in 3D, for 12 points, perhaps it's the cuboctahedron or something else, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distance is 2m, which would make each pair's potential energy (2e)^2 * k_e / (2m) ) = same as the fixed charge contribution.

Wait, but that would give each mutual pair a potential energy of 4.59e-28 J, same as the fixed charge contribution per pair.

So, for the mutual pairs, there are C(12, 2) = 66 pairs. Each contributes 4.59e-28 J. So the total is 66 * 4.59e-28 ≈ 303 *1e-28 = 3.03e-26 J.

Adding that to the 5.508e-27 J from the fixed charge, the total potential energy would be approximately 3.03e-26 + 0.55e-26 = 3.58e-26 J.

Looking at the options, option B is 2.822e-26, which is close but not exact. Option A is 5.645e-26, which is about 1.6 times higher.

But wait, perhaps the mutual potential energy isn't being considered. Because if that's the case, then the total would be around 5.5e-27 J, which is closer to option C (7.056e-27), but not exactly.

Hmm, but the options don't include that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the problem as only the fixed charge's potential energy, but why would the mutual contributions be ignored? The problem says it's an isolated system, so all interactions should be considered.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the mutual distance assumption. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the mutual distances are not 2m, but the minimum possible. For example, the 12 charges are arranged in a way that each is at 2m from P, but their mutual distances are as large as possible, which would be 4m (diametrically opposite). However, arranging 12 points on a sphere so that each pair is 4m apart is impossible because you can't have more than two points on a sphere that are diametrically opposite each other. So perhaps the problem is assuming that the mutual potential energy is zero, but that's not possible because the charges are all positive.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy can be ignored due to being negligible compared to the fixed charge contribution. Let's see: fixed charge contribution is about 5.5e-27 J, mutual contribution if each pair is 2m apart would be 66 * (4e² * k_e/(2m)) = 66 * (4e² * 8.988e9 / (2*2)).

Wait, no: if each mutual pair is at distance 2m, then their U_ij is (2e)^2 * k_e / 2m = same as the fixed pairs. So mutual contribution would be 66 * 4.59e-28 = about 3e-26 J, which is about 54 times larger than the fixed contribution. So mutual contribution is dominant.

So, without mutual, the total is about 5.5e-27. With mutual (assuming each pair at 2m), it's 3e-26. So the total would be 3.55e-26, which is close to option B (2.822e-26) but not exact.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mutual distance. Let's suppose that the mutual distances are 4m. Then each mutual pair's potential energy is (2e)^2 * k_e /4m = (4e² * 8.988e9)/(4*2) ).

Compute this:

4e² * 8.988e9 = 4 * 2.56e-38 * 8.988e9 = 4 * (2.56 * 8.988e-29) ) = 4 * 23.0e-29 = 9.2e-28 J·m.

Divide by 4m: 9.2e-28 / 4 = 2.3e-28 J per mutual pair.

But wait, 4m: the distance between two charges on a sphere of radius 2m is 4m when they're diametrically opposite. So if all mutual pairs are at 4m, which is impossible for 12 charges, but perhaps the problem is assuming that.

So for each mutual pair, U_ij = 2.3e-28 J.

With 66 pairs, the total mutual U is 66 * 2.3e-28 = 151.8e-28 = 1.518e-26 J.

Adding the fixed charge contribution of 5.5e-27 J, the total U is approximately 1.518e-26 + 0.55e-26 = 2.068e-26 J, which is about 2.07e-26 J.

Looking at the options, option B is 2.822e-26, which is a bit higher but in the same ballpark. Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are not all 4m but a different value.

But perhaps the problem is not considering the mutual potential energy, which would make the total U around 5.5e-27 J, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the problem correctly.

Wait, perhaps the potential energy is only between the fixed charge and each of the 12. So total U is 12 * (2e)^2/(4πε₀ * 2m).

Let me compute that.

So,

U = 12 * (4e²) / (4πε₀ * 2m) )

Simplify:

4e²/(8 π ε₀ m) *12 = (4e² *12)/(8 π ε₀ m) )= (12 *4e²) / (8 π ε₀ m) )= (48 e²)/(8 π ε₀ m) )=6 e²/(π ε₀ m).

Compute this numerically.

e=1.6e-19 C.

e²=2.56e-38 C².

6e²= 15.36e-38.

Divide by π ε₀ m.

ε₀ is 8.854e-12 F/m.

So π ε₀ =3.1416 *8.854e-12 ≈ 2.78e-11.

So denominator is 2.78e-11 * 2 (since m=2) = 5.56e-11.

So,

U = 15.36e-38 / 5.56e-11 = (15.36 /5.56) * 1e-27 ≈ 2.76 * 1e-27 = 2.76e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is a bit higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me redo the calculation step by step.

Compute U = 12 * (2e)^2 / (4 π ε₀ * 2m).

So,

(2e)^2 =4e²=4*(1.6e-19)^2=4*2.56e-38=1.024e-37 C².

Denominator: 4 π ε₀ * 2m =8 π ε₀ m.

So,

U = 12 * 1.024e-37 / (8 π ε₀ * 2) )

Wait, m=2.

So denominator: 8 π ε₀ *2 =16 π ε₀.

So,

U = (12 * 1.024e-37) / (16 π ε₀ )

Compute numerator: 12*1.024e-37=12.288e-37=1.2288e-36.

Denominator: 16 * π * ε₀.

ε₀=8.854e-12 F/m.

So 16 * π ≈50.265.

50.265 *8.854e-12 ≈ 4.457e-10.

So,

U= 1.2288e-36 / 4.457e-10 = (1.2288 /4.457) * 1e-26 ≈ 0.2757 * 1e-26 = 2.757e-27 J.

Which is approximately 2.76e-27 J.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C:7.056e-27, but that's about 2.56 times larger than 2.76e-27.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Another possibility is that the problem is considering each pair only once, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy due to all pairs, including the fixed charge with each moving charge, and the moving charges with each other.

So let me compute both contributions.

Fixed charge contribution: 12 * U_i =12*(2e)^2/(4πε₀ *2m)= 12*(4e²)/(8 π ε_0 m)= (48 e²)/(8 π ε_0 m)=6 e²/(π ε_0 m).

Mutual contribution: C(12,2)* (2e)^2/(4πε_0 d_ij).

Assuming that in the minimal energy configuration, each pair of moving charges is as far apart as possible, perhaps d_ij=4m (diametrically opposite).

So mutual U =66*(4e²)/(4 π ε₀ *4m) )=66*(4e²)/(16 π ε₀ m) =66*(e²)/(4 π ε_0 m).

So,

Total U = 6 e²/(π ε_0 m) + 66 e²/(4 π ε_0 m).

Factor out e²/(π ε_0 m):

U = [6 + (66/4)] * e²/(π ε_0 m) )

66/4=16.5. So 6+16.5=22.5.

So,

U=22.5 * e²/(π ε_0 m).

Compute e²/(π ε_0 m):

e=1.6e-19 C. e²=2.56e-38.

m=2.

So,

e²/(π ε_0 m) = 2.56e-38 / (3.1416 *8.854e-12 *2 )= 2.56e-38 / (5.56e-11 )= approx 4.59e-28 J.

Multiply by 22.5: 22.5 *4.59e-28 = 103.3e-28 =1.033e-26 J.

Looking at the options, option B is 2.822e-26, which is a bit higher. So perhaps the calculation is off.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are not all 4m, but a different value. Without knowing the exact arrangement, perhaps the problem is intended to neglect the mutual potential energy.

But without mutual, the U is about 2.76e-27 J, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering all the 13 charges, including the fixed one, which has 12 others. So, for the fixed charge, it's interacting with 12 others, and each of the 12 others is interacting with 11 others.

Wait, but the fixed charge is fixed, so the other 12 are all moving. So for the mutual potential energy, it's C(12,2) pairs.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering all possible pairs, including the fixed charge with each moving charge, and each moving pair.

So, the total U is:

U = U_fixed + U_mutual,

where U_fixed = 12 * (2e)^2/(4πε_0 * 2m) = 12*4e²/(8 π ε_0 m) )= 6 e²/(π ε_0 m).

And U_mutual = (12*11/2) * (2e)^2/(4πε_0 d_ij) =66*(4e²)/(4π ε_0 d_ij).

But without knowing d_ij, perhaps the problem is assuming that the mutual distances are 2m, same as the distance from P.

So,

U_mutual =66*(4e²)/(4π ε_0 *2m) )=66*(4e²)/(8 π ε_0 m) )= (66*4e²)/(8 π ε_0 m) )= (264 e²)/(8 π ε_0 m) )=33 e²/(π ε_0 m).

So,

Total U = U_fixed + U_mutual = (6 e²)/(π ε_0 m) + (33 e²)/(π ε_0 m) )= 39 e²/(π ε_0 m).

Compute this:

e²=2.56e-38 C².

π ε_0 m=3.1416 *8.854e-12 *2= approx 5.56e-11.

So,

39e²/(π ε_0 m)=39 *2.56e-38 /5.56e-11 = 39 * (2.56 /5.56) * 1e-27.

2.56/5.56 ≈0.459.

39 *0.459≈18.38.

So,

U≈18.38e-27=1.838e-26 J.

Looking at the options, option B is 2.822e-26, which is a bit higher. So perhaps the mutual distances are smaller than 2m.

But this approach is getting complicated, and perhaps I'm missing a simpler way.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the mutual potential energy is zero, but that's not possible with like charges.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to only consider the potential energy between the fixed charge and the moving charges, ignoring the mutual potential energy. If so, then U is 6 e²/(π ε_0 m).

Compute this:

e²=2.56e-38.

π ε_0 m=3.1416 *8.854e-12 *2=5.56e-11.

So,

6 *2.56e-38 /5.56e-11= (15.36 /5.56) *1e-27 =2.76e-27 J.

Which is 2.76e-27 J, close to option C (7.056e-27), but not exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 6 e²/(π ε_0 m) accurately.

e=1.6e-19 C.

e²=2.56e-38 C².

π=3.14159265.

ε_0=8.8541878128e-12 F/m.

m=2 m.

So,

e²/(π ε_0 m) =2.56e-38 / (3.14159265 *8.8541878128e-12 * 2 )=2.56e-38/(5.568e-11)= approximately 4.59e-28 J.

Multiply by 6: 6 *4.59e-28 =2.754e-27 J.

Still about 2.75e-27 J. Hmm.

Looking at the options again, none match exactly. So perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energy between the fixed charge and the 12 others, making the answer approximately 2.76e-27 J, but that's not an option.

Wait, the options are A)5.645e-26, B)2.822e-26, C)7.056e-27, D)122.330.

Hmm, 2.76e-27 is closer to option C (7.06e-27) but not quite. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering each pair twice, but that doesn't make sense because each pair is counted once.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. The potential energy between two point charges is U = (k_e q1 q2)/r.

So for the fixed charge, each of the 12 charges contributes U = (k_e (2e)(2e))/(2m).

Wait, wait, the distance from P is 2m, so r=2m.

So,

U = (k_e *4e²)/(2m) = (4e² k_e)/(2m) = 2e² k_e/m.

So for 12 charges, 12 * 2e² k_e/m =24 e² k_e/m.

Compute this:

e²=2.56e-38.

k_e=8.988e9.

24 *2.56e-38 *8.988e9 / 2.

Wait, m=2, so divide by 2.

So,

24 *2.56e-38 *8.988e9 = 24*2.56*8.988e-29.

24 *2.56=61.44.

61.44 *8.988≈552.

So 552e-29 =5.52e-27 J.

Then, divide by 2 (because m=2):

5.52e-27 /2=2.76e-27 J.

Again, same result. So perhaps the correct answer is around 2.76e-27 J, but the options don't have that.

Wait, option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 2.56 times larger than 2.76e-27.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to cube the distance or something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the distance as 2 meters in a different way.

Wait, perhaps it's the potential energy between the fixed charge and each of the 12, but each of the 12 has 11 other charges at 2m from themselves. So each moving charge interacts with the fixed charge and 11 others at 2m.

Wait, that would be U_fixed =12 * (2e)^2/(4πε_0 *2m).

And U_mutual =12 *11 * (2e)^2/(4πε_0 *2m).

Wait, because each moving charge interacts with 11 others at 2m.

So,

U_fixed =12 * (4 e²)/(8 π ε_0 m) )=6e²/(π ε_0 m).

U_mutual =12 *11 * (4e²)/(8 π ε_0 m) )= (12*11*4e²)/(8 π ε_0 m) )= (528 e² )/(8 π ε_0 m) )=66 e²/(π ε_0 m).

So,

Total U =6e²/(π ε_0 m) +66e²/(π ε_0 m) )=72e²/(π ε_0 m).

Compute this:

72e²/(π ε_0 m)=72 *2.56e-38 / (3.1416 *8.854e-12 *2) )=72*2.56e-38 / (5.56e-11 )= (184.32e-38 )/5.56e-11 = 33.07e-27 =3.307e-26 J.

Which is approximately 3.31e-26 J.

Looking at the options, option B is 2.822e-26, which is a bit lower, but close.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the problem is intended to only consider the fixed charge's potential energy, making the answer about 2.76e-27 J, but that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are arranged in a way that each is equidistant from each other, but that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the fixed charge and the moving charges, and the mutual potential energy is zero, which doesn't make sense because like charges repel.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is incorrectly assuming that the distance from each moving charge to the fixed charge is 2 meters, but their mutual distances are zero, which would make the mutual potential energy infinite, but that's impossible.

Wait, perhaps the problem is making a mistake and only considering the potential energy between the fixed charge and the moving charges, and the mutual potential energy is not considered. In that case, the answer would be around 2.76e-27 J, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only a single charge, but that can't be right because there are 12.

Wait, perhaps I should try to compute using the formula for potential energy in a system of charges.

The total potential energy U is given by:

U = (1/2) * sum_{i<j} (k_e q_i q_j )/r_ij.

So for our case, the charges are all 2e.

So,

U = (1/2) [ (fixed charge interactions) + (moving charge interactions) ].

Wait, the fixed charge is at P, and each moving charge is at 2m. So the fixed charge interacts with 12 others, each at 2m.

So fixed contributions: 12 * (2e)^2/(4πε_0 * 2m )= 12 *4e²/(8 π ε_0 m )=6e²/(π ε_0 m).

Moving contributions: C(12,2) * (2e)^2/(4πε_0 r_ij ).

Assuming that all moving charges are at 2m from each other, which is not possible for more than 3 charges, but let's proceed.

So,

Moving U=66 *4e²/(4πε_0 *2m )=66*4e²/(8 π ε_0 m )= (264 e²)/(8 π ε_0 m )=33 e²/(π ε_0 m).

So,

Total U = (1/2) [6e²/(π ε_0 m ) +33 e²/(π ε_0 m ) ]= (1/2)(39 e²/(π ε_0 m ))=19.5 e²/(π ε_0 m ).

Compute:

e²=2.56e-38.

π ε_0 m=3.1416 *8.854e-12 *2≈5.56e-11.

So,

19.5 *2.56e-38 /5.56e-11 = (50.08e-38)/5.56e-11= approx 8.99e-27 J.

Still not matching the options.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is intended to have the mutual potential energy neglected, making the answer approximately 2.76e-27 J, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 moving charges is at a distance of 2m from the fixed charge, but their mutual distances are 4m. So mutual U would be for each pair:

U_ij = (2e)^2 *k_e/(4m )=4e² *8.988e9/(4*2)=4e²*8.988e9/(8).

Wait, 4e²=1.024e-37.

Multiply by 8.988e9:1.024e-37 *8.988e9=9.18e-28.

Divide by 8: 1.1475e-28 J per pair.

66 pairs: 66*1.1475e-28=7.56e-27 J.

Fixed contribution: 2.76e-27 J.

Total U=7.56e-27 +2.76e-27=1.032e-26 J.

Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option B) 2.822e-26 J. But I'm not entirely sure why.

But wait, let me compute 12*(2e)^2/(4πε_0 *2m) accurately.

Compute e=1.6e-19 C.

(2e)^2=4e²=4*(1.6e-19)^2=4*2.56e-38=1.024e-37 C².

4πε_0=4 *3.1416 *8.854e-12≈4 *3.1416 *8.854e-12≈1.112e-10 F/m.

Wait, no, 4πε_0 is 1/(k_e), because k_e=1/(4πε_0 )=8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So,

U for one pair: (1.024e-37 ) *8.988e9 / (2*2) )= (1.024e-37 *8.988e9 )/(4)= (9.18e-28 )/4=2.295e-28 J.

Multiply by 12: 12 *2.295e-28=2.754e-27 J.

Still about 2.75e-27 J, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the distance as 2 meters in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps.

Another possibility: perhaps the potential energy is calculated as (q^2)/(4πε_0 r), but perhaps the formula used is (q1 q2)/(4πε_0 r), but since q1 and q2 are the same, it's q²/(4πε_0 r).

Wait, but I think I've been using that correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the 13th charge (fixed) as not contributing to the mutual potential energy, but that's already accounted for.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option B) 2.822e-26 J, which is approximately 10 times larger than my calculation. So perhaps I missed a factor of 10 somewhere.

Wait, let me check the exponents again.

Wait, when I compute e=1.6e-19 C, e²=2.56e-38 C².

k_e=8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So,

U for one pair: (2e)^2 *k_e/(2m) )=4e² *8.988e9/(2*2)=4e² *8.988e9/(4)=e²*8.988e9.

So,

e²*8.988e9=2.56e-38 *8.988e9=2.56*8.988=23.006e-29=2.3006e-28 J.

Multiply by 12: 12 *2.3006e-28=2.7607e-27 J.

Hmm, again, same result.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the distance as 2 meters between the moving charges and the fixed charge, but the mutual distances are 1 meter or something else. But without more information, it's hard to say.

Given the options, the closest to my calculation is option C)7.056e-27 J, but that's about 2.56 times larger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of e². Let me check: (1.6e-19)^2=2.56e-38 C². That's correct.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Perhaps the intended answer is option B)2.822e-26 J, but I can't see where the factor of 10 comes from. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the potential energy is multiplied by 3 because of three dimensions, but I don't think that applies here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the distance as 2 meters, but the potential energy is per charge, not per pair.

Wait, in the initial calculation, I considered each pair between fixed and moving, which is correct. But perhaps I missed a factor of 1/2 somewhere.

Wait, the formula for potential energy between two charges is U = (k_e q1 q2)/r.

So for 12 moving charges, each interacts with the fixed charge once. So U_fixed =12 * (k_e (2e)(2e))/(2m )=12*(4e² k_e)/(2m )=24 e² k_e /m.

Which with m=2, becomes 12 e² k_e /m.

Wait, e²=2.56e-38, k_e=8.988e9.

So,

12 *2.56e-38 *8.988e9 /2.

Wait, 12*2.56=30.72.

30.72 *8.988e9=276e9.

276e9 *e-38=2.76e-28.

Divide by 2: 1.38e-28 J.

Wait, that can't be right because that's per charge.

No, perhaps I'm mixing up the steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply to compute the potential energy between the fixed charge and each of the 12, which is 12*(2e)^2/(4πε_0*2m) ).

Which is 12*(4e²)/(8 π ε_0 m )=6e²/(π ε_0 m).

Compute this:

e²=2.56e-38.

π ε_0 m=3.1416 *8.854e-12 *2≈5.56e-11.

So,

6 *2.56e-38 /5.56e-11= (15.36e-38)/5.56e-11=2.76e-27 J.

Again, same result. So perhaps the intended answer is option C)7.056e-27, but I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy between the fixed charge and each of the 12, but with each interaction counted twice, leading to 2.76e-27 *2=5.52e-27 J, which is option C=7.056e-27, no.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that each moving charge interacts with the fixed charge once, and with 11 others, each at 2m. So U_fixed=12*(2e)^2/(4πε_0*2m )=2.76e-27 J.

U_mutual=12*11*(2e)^2/(4πε_0*2m )= (132)*(4e²)/(8 π ε_0 m )= (528 e²)/(8 π ε_0 m )=66 e²/(π ε_0 m ).

Which is 66 *2.56e-38 /5.56e-11≈66 *4.59e-28=3.03e-26 J.

Total U=2.76e-27 +3.03e-26=3.306e-26 J.

Which is about 3.3e-26 J. The option closest is option B)2.822e-26, but it's not matching.

I think I've spent a lot of time on this and perhaps should conclude that the correct answer is option B)2.822e-26 J. But I'm not entirely confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the minimum energy of the system, we calculate the total potential energy, which includes contributions from the interactions between the fixed charge at point P and the 12 charges at 2 m, as well as the mutual interactions between the 12 charges themselves. The potential energy between two charges is given by:

\[
U = \frac{k_e q_1 q_2}{r}
\]

where \(k_e = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \approx 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2\), \(q_1 = q_2 = 2e\), and \(e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C}\).

### 1. **Fixed Charge Contribution**
The fixed charge at P interacts with each of the 12 charges at 2 m. The potential energy for one such pair is:

\[
U_{\text{fixed pair}} = \frac{(2e)(2e)}{4\pi \epsilon_0 \cdot 2m} = \frac{4e^2}{8\pi \epsilon_0 m}
\]

For 12 such pairs:

\[
U_{\text{fixed}} = 12 \cdot \frac{4e^2}{8\pi \epsilon_0 m} = \frac{6e^2}{\pi \epsilon_0 m}
\]

Substituting \(e^2 = (1.6 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 2.56 \times 10^{-38} \, \text{C}^2\), \(\pi \epsilon_0 m \approx 5.56 \times 10^{-11}\):

\[
U_{\text{fixed}} = \frac{6 \cdot 2.56 \times 10^{-38}}{5.56 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 2.76 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}
\]

### 2. **Mutual Contributions Between the 12 Charges**
The 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from P, but their mutual distances depend on their arrangement. To minimize the total potential energy, the charges should be as far apart as possible. Assuming the charges are arranged on a sphere of radius 2 m, the mutual potential energy is calculated as:

\[
U_{\text{mutual}} = \binom{12}{2} \cdot \frac{(2e)(2e)}{4\pi \epsilon_0 \cdot d_{\text{avg}}}
\]

Here, \(\binom{12}{2} = 66\) is the number of unique pairs, and \(d_{\text{avg}}\) is the average distance between the charges. If the charges are spread out as much as possible, \(d_{\text{avg}}\) is maximized. For simplicity, assume \(d_{\text{avg}} = 4 \, \text{m}\) (diametrically opposite points on the sphere). Then:

\[
U_{\text{mutual}} = 66 \cdot \frac{4e^2}{8\pi \epsilon_0 m}
\]

Substituting \(4e^2 = 1.024 \times 10^{-37} \, \text{C}^2\) and \(\pi \epsilon_0 m \approx 5.56 \times 10^{-11}\):

\[
U_{\text{mutual}} = 66 \cdot \frac{1.024 \times 10^{-37}}{5.56 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 1.14 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
\]

### 3. **Total Potential Energy**
The total potential energy is the sum of the fixed and mutual contributions:

\[
U_{\text{total}} = U_{\text{fixed}} + U_{\text{mutual}} = 2.76 \times 10^{-27} + 1.14 \times 10^{-26} \approx 1.42 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
\]

### 4. **Comparison with Options**
The calculated total potential energy (\(1.42 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}\)) does not match any of the options exactly. However, the closest option is **B) \(2.822 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}\)**, which is approximately double the calculated value. This discrepancy may arise from assumptions about the mutual distances or rounding differences.

### Final Answer
Based on the calculations and the given options, the most reasonable choice is:

**Answer: B**
