Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this NMR and LC-MS question. Let's read through it again to make sure I get all the details. 

The question is about a small peptidic compound that's been synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum looks mostly correct except for two peaks from the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. The coupling pattern doesn't suggest spin-spin coupling as the cause, so it's not like they're splitting each other. 

Then, the LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature shows two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass, matching the expected molecule. So, same mass but two peaks in LC-MS. Hmm.

Let me think about the possibilities.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. Well, if it's a precursor, the mass would be different. Because a precursor is a starting material that hasn't undergone a reaction. So in the LC-MS, it would have a different mass. But the question says the mass is the same as expected. So probably not A.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers have the same molecular weight, so same mass in MS. In LC-MS, if the column is chiral, they may separate, but often achiral columns can't tell them apart. Wait, but the question says the LC-MS has two peaks of equal intensity, same mass. If the column isn't chiral, the enantiomers would co-elute, so would show as one peak. But if the column is chiral, they would separate. But in the problem, it's a crude compound. Maybe the synthesis isn't pure. But the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton, which would be different in enantiomers. Wait, in enantiomers, the alpha protons would be identical except for their environment. Wait, no, in an enantiomer, each proton's environment is mirrored. So the NMR would look the same because the peaks are identical. But in the question, the two peaks have similar shifts but are split. So maybe not B. Because if it's a racemic mixture, the NMR would just look like a singlet, not two separate peaks. Or wait, noâ€”unless something else is causing it.

Option C: Double coupling during amide bond formation. Double coupling refers to when a proton couples with two different sets of protons. Like in a vicinal coupling scenario. Wait, but the question says the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. So that might not be it. Or maybe it's something else. Hmm. Or perhaps during the formation of the amide bond, some sort of coupling leads to two different products with the same mass? Not sure. I'm a bit confused on this option.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and different NMR spectra. So if the compound is a mix of diastereomers, certain protons would have different environments. But the question says that the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton. Wait, if the diastereomers have the same alpha-proton environment, they would appear as one peak. But if the environment is different, the shifts would be different. However, the problem states that the two peaks have similar shifts, so maybe not. But wait, another possibility: maybe the diastereomerism is in a part of the molecule that doesn't affect the alpha-proton's environment. Or perhaps the diastereomers have some symmetry that causes the alpha protons to have the same shift but couple differently? Hmm, but then why would the coupling pattern rule out spin-spin?

Alternatively, maybe the diastereomers have some other structural differences that cause the NMR to split the signal. Wait, but the question said they ruled out spin-spin coupling, so maybe it's a different coupling, like scalar coupling across a longer range. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's go back to the NMR. The problem is that the same alpha-proton is giving two peaks. The integrals add up to one proton, so each peak is about 0.5H. So the two peaks are combining for one proton. How can that happen?

Possible scenarios: Splitting due to coupling, but the coupling is from another proton. But the question says spin-spin coupling is ruled out, so not that. So maybe something else is causing the splitting. Another possibility is that the proton is split into two due to being in a different environment, like if there's a diastereomer. Wait, but diastereomers would cause different shifts, but maybe in some cases, like if the diastereomers have the same shift for that proton.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a racemic mixture. Wait, but in that case, the NMR would show a singlet because the two enantiomers are mirror images and the peaks would overlap. Unless the molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes the alpha-protons equivalent, but that's more about splitting. Hmm.

Wait, the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha proton, so perhaps the molecule is not a single enantiomer but something else. Let me think about the options again.

Option C says something about double coupling during amide bond formation. Double coupling could lead to a splitting pattern that might show as two peaks, but the question says the coupling pattern isn't spin-spin. So maybe that's not it.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. If the diastereomers have a different configuration at a stereocenter that's near the alpha proton, would that change the shift? Well, the shifts are similar, so perhaps the configuration is at a position that doesn't affect the alpha-proton much. But if the diastereomers have the same alpha-proton environment, then they would appear as a single peak. So perhaps not.

Wait, another possibility: The compound is a racemic mixture but with some other stereocenters. Wait, but in that case, the NMR wouldn't split the alpha-proton unless it's part of a stereocenter that's causing diastereotopicity. Maybe the amide group is in a chiral environment, so the alpha protons are diastereotopic. But if the molecule is a racemic mixture, the diastereotopic protons would cause coupling, but if the sample is racemic, the coupling would average out, so you wouldn't see splitting in the NMR. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps the two peaks in the NMR are due to a mixture of two diastereomers where the alpha protons are coupled to each other. But the question says the coupling isn't spin-spin. So maybe it's something else.

Alternatively, the compound could be a mix of two different diastereomers, each with a slightly different environment for the alpha proton, causing two peaks with similar shifts. But then why would the integrals add up to one? Unless each diastereomer contributes half the amount of that proton. Wait, but if it's a 50:50 mix, each would have the same number of protons, so the integral would be 1H total. That makes sense.

But then, in the LC-MS, if the two diastereomers have the same molecular weight, they would have the same mass. But in LC-MS, seeing two peaks suggests that the separation is based on something else, like retention time. So if the LC conditions separate the diastereomers, you'd see two peaks. But wait, diastereomers typically have different physical properties, so they might elute at different times. So the LC would show two peaks.

But the question says that both have the same mass. So diastereomers have the same molecular weight, yes. So the options are looking at D.

Alternatively, the problem with the NMR is that the same alpha proton is split into two. So perhaps the molecule has some other structural feature causing the same proton to appear as two, but that's less likely.

Wait, the NMR is for the crude compound. So maybe during the synthesis, more than one product is formed. So if the crude contains two diastereomers, each would contribute a peak for the alpha proton. Since the shifts are similar, perhaps the diastereomers have the same chemical environment for that proton. But that's unlikely unless the change is not near that proton.

Alternatively, maybe the two peaks are from different conformations of the same molecule. But in NMR, conformers usually have exchange that makes the peaks broad or merge, especially at room temperature. But the question didn't mention temperature, so maybe not.

Wait, going back to the options. The options are A to D.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond. Double coupling refers to when a proton is coupled to two different sets of protons, leading to multiple peaks. For example, in a vicinal coupling scenario where a proton is coupled to two different adjacent protons. So the splitting could be AB system, leading to two doublets. But the question says they ruled out spin-spin coupling, so perhaps that's not it.

Alternatively, during the formation of the amide bond, perhaps some by-products form. But the mass is same, so same molecular weight. So perhaps the two peaks are not by-products but different forms of the same molecule, like diastereomers.

So, putting it all together: LC-MS shows two peaks, same mass. So same molecular weight, so same molecular formula. So either enantiomers or diastereomers. But if they're enantiomers, the NMR wouldn't split the same alpha-proton. Enantiomers have identical physical properties except for direction of optical rotation. So NMR would look the same, not show two peaks. So the two peaks in NMR suggest it's diastereomers.

Because diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR would show different shifts. Wait, but the question says the two peaks for the same alpha-proton have similar shifts. Hmm, perhaps the diastereomers have the same shift for that proton. That seems unlikely, unless the environment is the same. Maybe if the diastereomers have the same chemical environment for that particular proton, but differ elsewhere. But that's a bit tricky.

Another angle: If the compound is a racemic mixture, the NMR looks the same. But in this case, the NMR has two peaks for the same proton. So that's not possible for enantiomers. So it's more likely that the compound is a mixture of diastereomers.

So, with that, the answer would be D.

Wait, but another option: the presence of a double bond in a certain configuration. If there's a double bond, maybe there's some cis and trans isomerism, but that's another type of diastereomer. So if that's the case, the NMR would see two peaks if the two diastereomers have different shifts for that proton.

Alternatively, maybe the crude compound is a mixture of two different diastereomers, each contributing a peak for the same alpha proton. Since the shifts are similar, but not identical, and the integrals are equal, that would add up to the expected 1H. So the NMR would show two peaks, each about 0.5H.

In LC-MS, the two diastereomers would have same mass, so same m/z, but different retention times, hence two peaks.

Wait, but in mass spec, the mass would be same. But in LC-MS, if the two molecules are diastereomers, they would have same molecular weight and same mass spec, but different retention times. So that would fit.

So the most likely answer is D) the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves analyzing a small peptidic compound where the 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks corresponding to the same alpha-proton, with similar chemical shifts and equal integrals (together integrating to 1H). The LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature reveals two peaks of equal intensity, both with the same mass consistent with the expected molecule. The task is to determine the most likely explanation for these observations.

### Analysis of Options:

**Option A: The compound is contaminated with a precursor**  
This is unlikely because a precursor would have a different molecular weight and, consequently, a different mass spectrum. The question specifies that both peaks in the LC-MS have the same mass as the expected molecule, ruling out contamination with a precursor.

**Option B: The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers**  
Enantiomers have the same molecular weight and identical NMR spectra because they are mirror images of each other. Therefore, the NMR would not show two distinct peaks for the same alpha-proton. Additionally, achiral LC columns would not separate enantiomers, and even chiral columns would not explain the splitting pattern observed in the NMR. Thus, this option is inconsistent with the data.

**Option C: 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction**  
Double coupling refers to a proton being coupled to two different sets of protons, which could theoretically result in two peaks. However, the question explicitly states that spin-spin coupling has been ruled out as an explanation, making this option unlikely. Furthermore, double coupling would not explain the presence of two distinct peaks in the LC-MS spectrum.

**Option D: The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers**  
Diastereoisomers have the same molecular weight and would produce the same mass spectrum in LC-MS. If the diastereoisomers have slightly different environments for the alpha-proton, they could result in two distinct peaks in the NMR spectrum with similar chemical shifts. The equal integrals (1H total) suggest a 50:50 mixture of the two diastereoisomers. The LC-MS separation is consistent with diastereoisomers, as they often have different physical properties and can be separated by LC. This explanation aligns well with the observations.

### Conclusion:  
The most likely explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers, which accounts for the NMR and LC-MS observations. 

**Answer: D**
