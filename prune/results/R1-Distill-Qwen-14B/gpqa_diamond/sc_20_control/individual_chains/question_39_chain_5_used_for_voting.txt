Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

We have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle in the same conditions. The wave function for each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, no, looking again, maybe I misread. Oh, wait, the function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by something? Or is it (a divided by sqrt(1 +x)) minus 0.5i? Hmm, the way it's written is "a / sqrt(1 +x) - 0.5*i". Oh, right, the i is the imaginary unit. So the wave function has a real part and an imaginary part.

But the problem says that when they measured the position of the particles, none were found at x <1 or x>3. So the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. That must mean that the probability of finding the particle is zero outside this interval, and non-zero between 1 and 3.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the wave function's square modulus gives the probability density. So to find the probability, I need to compute |ψ(x)|² and integrate that between x=1 and x=3, and it should equal 1 because all probabilities must sum to 1.

But wait, let's look at the given wave function again. The wave function is (a / sqrt(1 +x)) - 0.5i. So ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - (0.5)i. Hmm, that's a complex function. The modulus squared would then be [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2, because |a + b i|^2 = a² + b².

So |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

But for the particle to be found only between x=1 and x=3, the probability outside that should be zero. So, the wave function must be zero outside that region. Wait, but the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Wait, that can't be right because the modulus squared would be non-zero everywhere unless a is zero, which probably isn't the case. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The wave function given is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, but for the wave function to be normalizable, and for the particle to be found only between x=1 and x=3, perhaps the wave function is only non-zero in that interval and zero outside. So maybe the given expression is valid only between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. But the problem states that the wave function is given as that expression in the part of space where the particle can exist. So, perhaps in this region, the wave function is as given, and zero outside.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased, it says "the wave function of each particle, in a part of space where it can exist, can be described as..." So that part is where it can exist, which is between x=1 and x=3. So outside that, the wave function is zero. So the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. So the given ψ(x) is valid only in that region. So to find the normalization constant 'a', we have to ensure that the integral of |ψ(x)|² from x=1 to x=3 is equal to 1.

So the first step is to compute the normalization condition.

Let me write out |ψ(x)|². Since ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, the modulus squared is [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2. Because when you have a complex number (A + Bi), the modulus squared is A² + B². Here, A is (a / sqrt(1+x)), and B is -0.5.

So |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Now, the integral of this from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1. Let's set up the integral:

∫₁³ [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

We can split this into two separate integrals:

a² ∫₁³ 1/(1+x) dx + ∫₁³ 0.25 dx = 1.

Compute each integral separately.

First integral: ∫1/(1+x) dx. The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln|1+x| + C. So evaluating from 1 to 3:

ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So the first term becomes a² * ln(2).

Second integral: ∫0.25 dx from 1 to 3. The integral is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25 *2=0.5.

So the equation becomes a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Subtract 0.5 from both sides: a² * ln(2) = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute that value.

ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a² ≈ 0.7213, so a is the square root of that. √0.7213 ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is close. So the answer would be B) 0.85.

Wait, but let me double-check the steps. Did I make any mistakes in the setup?

Wait, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So when I compute |ψ|², it's [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2, because the imaginary part is 0.5, so (0.5)^2 is 0.25.

So that part seems correct. The integration from 1 to 3 is correct.

Wait, but wait another thing: the wave function is written with sqrt(1+x). Oh wait, wait a second. The denominator is sqrt(1 + x), but that's only valid when 1+x is positive. So x must be > -1, which is the case in our domain, since x is between 1 and 3, so 1+x is between 2 and 4, so sqrt is defined.

But another thought: when we have a wave function that is a sum of a real and imaginary part, perhaps we're assuming that the wave function can be written as ψ(x) = R(x) + i I(x), and the modulus squared is R² + I². So in this case, R(x) = a/sqrt(1+x), I(x) = -0.5. So the modulus squared is (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

So that part is correct.

Wait, but what if the wave function is given as ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) multiplied by (-0.5i)? No, the question says it's (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5 i. So it's a sum of two terms: a real term and an imaginary term. So the modulus squared is as I computed.

So the integral is correct. So the value of 'a' comes out to be approximately 0.849, which is closest to option B, 0.85.

To determine the value of "a" in the given wave function, we start by analyzing the wave function provided: 

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The modulus squared of the wave function is given by:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Since the particle is only found between \(x = 1\) and \(x = 3\), the normalization condition requires that the integral of \(|\psi(x)|^2\) over this interval equals 1:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

\[
a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx + \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 1
\]

1. The first integral is:

\[
\int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx = \ln|1+x| \Big|_1^3 = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2)
\]

2. The second integral is:

\[
\int_1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5
\]

Substituting these results back into the normalization condition:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \(a^2\):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849
\]

The closest value to \(a \approx 0.849\) among the given options is \(0.85\), which corresponds to option **B**.

∫₁³ [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

We can split this into two separate integrals:

a² ∫₁³ 1/(1+x) dx + ∫₁³ 0.25 dx = 1.

Compute each integral separately.

First integral: ∫1/(1+x) dx. The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln|1+x| + C. So evaluating from 1 to 3:

ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So the first term becomes a² * ln(2).

Second integral: ∫0.25 dx from 1 to 3. The integral is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25 *2=0.5.

So the equation becomes a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Subtract 0.5 from both sides: a² * ln(2) = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute that value.

ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a² ≈ 0.7213, so a is the square root of that. √0.7213 ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is close. So the answer would be B) 0.85.

Wait, but let me double-check the steps. Did I make any mistakes in the setup?

Wait, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So when I compute |ψ|², it's [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2, because the imaginary part is 0.5, so (0.5)^2 is 0.25.

So that part is correct.

So the integral is correct. So the value of 'a' comes out to be approximately 0.849, which is closest to option B, 0.85.
