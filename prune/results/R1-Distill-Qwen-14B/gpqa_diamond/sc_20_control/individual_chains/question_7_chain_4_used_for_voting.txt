Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about the annihilation of high-energy gamma-rays with photons from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). The process is gamma gamma annihilation producing electron-positron pairs: γγ → e+ e-. The question is asking from what energy gamma-rays their lifetimes in the universe would be limited by this process. We're told the average photon energy of the CMB is 1e-3 eV.

Hmm, I remember that the CMB is this radiation leftover from the Big Bang, and it's almost uniform in all directions. The average photon energy is given as 1e-3 eV. Now, gamma-rays are high-energy photons, so when a gamma-ray interacts with a CMB photon, they can annihilate into an electron-positron pair if certain conditions are met.

I think this has to do with cross-sections and interaction probabilities. The lifetime of a gamma-ray would be limited by how often it interacts with the CMB photons. If the interaction rate is high enough, the gamma-ray won't travel far before annihilating, thus limiting its lifetime.

Wait, I remember that the interaction rate depends on the cross-section and the number of target photons. The cross-section for this process must depend on the energy of the gamma-ray and the CMB photon. Also, the CMB photon's energy is much smaller, so maybe the gamma's energy is the main variable here.

I think the cross-section for γγ → e+ e- has a certain dependence on the energy. From what I recall, the cross-section for two photons annihilating into a pair peaks when the combined energy is at least twice the electron mass (since E=mc², 2*0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV). But since the CMB photon is so low energy (1e-3 eV), the gamma-ray must be high enough so that when it interacts with the CMB photon, the total energy meets this threshold.

Wait, but the cross-section for this process is probably proportional to some power of the photon energies. I think at high energies, the cross-section for γγ → e+ e- scales with the logarithm of the energy, but I'm not too sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a threshold process where the cross-section increases once the energy is above a certain value.

Alternatively, I remember that the optical depth τ is a measure of the probability that a photon will interact. The optical depth is the product of the cross-section σ, the number density n of target photons, and the path length L. So τ = σ * n * L. If τ is large, the interaction probability is high.

The lifetime of the gamma-ray would be limited when the interaction rate is significant. The mean lifetime would be inversely proportional to the interaction rate, so τ ~ 1/(σ n). Wait, no. The mean free time τ is 1/(σ n). So the lifetime is limited when τ is comparable to the age of the universe or something like that.

Wait, the age of the universe is about 13.8 billion years, which is roughly 4e17 seconds. But perhaps I don't need to plug that in directly because the problem might involve a relation where the energies are related through the cross-section and the CMB photon density.

The CMB photon density is n = energy density / (energy per photon). The energy density of the CMB is about 1e-4 erg/cm³, but I might need to convert that into photons per cm³. Alternatively, I can think in terms of number density n. The CMB photon number density can be approximated as n ≈ 1e8 photons/cm³. Wait, I think it's about 410 photons per cubic centimeter at present, but that's about 4e-4 photons per cm³? Hmm, maybe I should be precise.

Wait, the CMB temperature is about 2.7 K. The number density of photons is given by the photon density formula, which comes from the blackbody spectrum. The number density is n = (8 π / (15)) (k_B T)^3 / (h^3 c^3) ) * (something like that). Let me think.

The formula for the number density of photons in a blackbody is n = (g_{\gamma} / 2) * (2 \pi^2) (k_B T / h c)^3 * zeta(3), where g_{\gamma} is the degrees of freedom (which is 2 for photons, spin 1, two polarizations), zeta(3) is Apéry's constant, approximately 1.202.

Wait, let me recall: the number density of photons is given by n_γ = (8 π^5 k_B^4 T^3 )/(15 h^3 c^3) ) * (1/(ζ(3))} )? Or is it another factor? Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to remember that for T = 2.7 K, the number density n is about 411 photons per cm³. Oh, wait, wait, no, that can't be right because the value I remember is around 4e8 photons per m³, which is 4e5 per liter. Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up units.

Alternatively, the photon number density is given by n_γ = ( (8 π^2) / (15) ) (k_B T / h c )^3 * (g_{\gamma}/2) * ζ(3) )^{-1} ?

Wait, maybe I should just look for the number density of the CMB. I think at the current time, the CMB photon number density is about 411 photons per cubic centimetre. So 411 photons/cm³ is 411e6 photons/m³ because 1 cm³ is 1e-6 m³. Wait, no, wait: 1 m³ is (100 cm)^3 = 1e6 cm³. So if there are 411 photons per cm³, then per m³ it's 411e6 photons/m³.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to proceed with the calculation without getting exact numbers, but using the given average photon energy.

The average energy of CMB photons is given as 1e-3 eV. So each photon has about that energy. So the energy density u_γ is n_γ * average energy per photon. So u_γ = n_γ * E_avg.

But wait, the problem says the average photon energy is 1e-3 eV. So E_avg = 1e-3 eV.

If I can find n_γ, the number density, then I can proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps I don't need the exact number because the problem might be solved using an approximate relation.

Wait, the process is γ + γ → e+ e-. The cross-section for this process for a gamma and a CMB photon is given by some function of their energies.

The cross-section σ is a function of the center-of-mass energy sqrt(s), where s is the square of the total energy in the center-of-mass frame. For the pair production to happen, the center-of-mass energy must be at least 2 m_e c², because that's the rest mass energy of the electron and positron. m_e c² is about 0.511 MeV, so 2 m_e c² is about 1.022 MeV.

So, sqrt(s) >= 2 m_e c². Let me write that down:

s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2 (but since they're moving in opposite directions, their momenta are opposite, so p2 = -p1, so the vector sum is zero). Wait, no, because the photons are moving in opposite directions, their momenta are opposite. Wait, no. Wait, in the rest frame of the two photons, their momenta are back to back. Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, for two photons, the total energy squared is s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c - p2 c)^2.

Wait, for photons, E = p c, so E1 = p1 c, E2 = p2 c. Let me suppose that the gamma photon has energy E, and the CMB photon has energy ε. Let me assume that the two photons are moving in opposite directions. Then, the total energy is E + ε, and the total momentum is (E/(c)) - (ε/(c)) in the direction of the gamma photon. So the invariant s is s = (E + ε)^2 - [ (E - ε) ) ]^2 c². Wait, no, because the momentum is E/(c) in the gamma's direction, and -ε/(c) in the opposite direction. So the vector sum is (E - ε)/c in the gamma's direction. So the invariant s is (E + ε)^2 - ( (E - ε)/c )^2 c^2. So s = (E + ε)^2 - (E - ε)^2.

Calculating that: (E + ε)^2 = E² + 2 E ε + ε².

(E - ε)^2 = E² - 2 E ε + ε².

So s = E² + 2 E ε + ε² - E² + 2 E ε - ε².

Wait, wait, no. Because s is (E_total)^2 - (p_total c)^2.

Wait, E_total is E + ε.

p_total is (E/(c)) (since the gamma photon momentum is E/c in its direction) minus (ε/(c)) (since the CMB photon is moving opposite, so its momentum is -ε/(c)).

So p_total = (E - ε)/c.

So then, s = (E + ε)^2 - ( (E - ε)/c )^2 c².

Which simplifies to:

s = (E + ε)^2 - (E - ε)^2.

Expanding both:

(E + ε)^2 = E² + 2 E ε + ε².

(E - ε)^2 = E² - 2 E ε + ε².

Subtracting, s = [E² + 2 E ε + ε²] - [E² - 2 E ε + ε²] = 4 E ε.

So s = 4 E ε.

Then, sqrt(s) is 2 sqrt(E ε).

For pair production to occur, we need sqrt(s) >= 2 m_e c².

So 2 sqrt(E ε) >= 2 m_e c².

Dividing both sides by 2, sqrt(E ε) >= m_e c².

Squaring both sides: E ε >= (m_e c²)^2.

So the condition is E * ε >= (m_e c²)^2.

But wait, in the problem, the average CMB photon energy is ε = 1e-3 eV. So E is the gamma-ray energy. So the condition for the process to be possible is E >= (m_e c²)^2 / ε.

Wait, but wait, let's compute that.

m_e c^2 is 0.511 MeV = 0.511e6 eV.

So (m_e c^2)^2 = (0.511e6 eV)^2 = (0.511e6)^2 eV².

Divide that by ε = 1e-3 eV.

So E >= (0.511e6)^2 / 1e-3 = (0.511e6)^2 * 1e3.

Calculating that:

(0.511e6)^2 = (5.11e5)^2 = (5.11)^2 * 1e10 = 26.1121 * 1e10 = 2.61121e11.

Multiply by 1e3: 2.61121e14 eV.

Wait, but 1 GeV is 1e9 eV. So 2.61121e14 eV is 2.61121e5 GeV.

Wait, but that's a very high energy. The options are on the order of 1e5 GeV. Let's check the options.

Option C is 2.6e5 GeV, which matches this calculation. So, the gamma-rays with energy E ~ (m_e c^2)^2 / ε would be the threshold for this process. But wait, the question isn't about the threshold but the energy at which their lifetimes are limited by this process. So perhaps the cross-section increases at higher energies, so higher-energy gammas interact more, leading to shorter lifetimes.

But perhaps the gamma-ray's lifetime is limited when the interaction rate equals a critical rate, like when the mean free time equals the age of the universe. But perhaps the calculation is about finding the energy where the interaction probability is non-negligible, so the lifetime is significantly reduced.

Alternatively, the problem might be using the concept of the interaction cross-section and photon density to find the energy where the mean free path becomes comparable to the size of the universe, making the optical depth significant. But perhaps the calculation boils down to E ~ (m_e c^2)^2 / (ε * n_γ c * ... )

Wait, perhaps I should consider the mean free time τ = 1/(σ n), where σ is the cross-section and n is the number density of target photons.

The lifetime is limited when τ is comparable to the age of the universe, say τ ~ t_universe.

But perhaps for high-energy gammas, the cross-section σ is given by the threshold cross-section, which is proportional to (m_e c^2)^4 / (E^2 ε^2). Because in the cross-section for pair production, when E >> m_e c^2, the cross-section scales as σ ~ (m_e c^2)^2/(E^2 ε) * something. Alternatively, at the threshold, the cross-section is a minimum, and above that, it increases.

Wait, I think the cross-section for γγ → e+ e- is given approximately by σ ≈ ( (4 π α^2 )/(3 s) ) * (s/(4 m_e^2 c^4 ))^2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I've heard that the cross-section for pair production on the CMB scales as σ ∝ (m_e c^2)^4/(E^2 ε), where E is the gamma energy and ε is the CMB photon energy. So σ ≈ (4 π α^2 )/( (E ε )^2 ) * (m_e c^2)^4/(s) ), but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula for the interaction rate. The interaction rate Γ is σ n c, where n is the number density of CMB photons, and c is the speed of light.

Then, the lifetime τ is 1/Γ. For the lifetime to be limited by this process, τ should be on the order of the age of the universe, t_universe ~ 1e18 seconds.

So, Γ = σ n c.

We want τ ≈ t_universe → Γ ≈ 1/t_universe.

So, σ n c ≈ 1/t_universe.

But the cross-section σ depends on the energy E of the gamma and the CMB photon energy ε. So let's model σ.

From pair production theory, the cross-section for two photons producing an electron-positron pair is given by:

σ(E, ε) = (4 π/3) * (α^2/(E ε)) * ( (m_e c^2)^2 )^2 / ( (E ε)^2 ) )

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to use the formula:

σ(E, ε) = (4 π α^2 )/( s ) * ( (s)/(4 m_e^2 c^4) )^2,

where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy, s = 4 E ε.

Wait, maybe I should find an approximate expression for the cross-section.

Another approach I recall: the cross-section for γγ → e+ e- is given by:

σ ≈ (8 π^2 α^2 m_e^4 c^4 )/( (E γ)^2 (E_cm)^2 )

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look for the relation between the cross-section and the energy.

Alternatively, I remember that the cross-section for the process γγ → e+ e- can be approximated as σ ≈ (4 π α^2)/(E_γ^2) * (m_e c^2)^2/(ε E_γ) )

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the threshold. The cross-section is non-zero only when the center-of-mass energy is above 2 m_e c², which we've already established requires E γ ε >= (m_e c^2)^2.

But since the cross-section above the threshold increases with energy, but I'm not certain about the exact dependence.

Alternatively, considering that the cross-section σ is inversely proportional to E^2, because at high energies, the cross-section decreases as 1/E^2. So, σ ~ (m_e c^2)^4/(E^2 ε^2), perhaps? Because the threshold condition is E ε >= (m_e c^2)^2.

So, σ = k * (m_e c^2)^4/(E^2 ε^2 ), where k is some constant.

Then, substituting into the interaction rate:

Γ = σ n c = [k (m_e c^2)^4/(E^2 ε^2 ) ] * n * c.

We can set Γ ≈ 1/t_universe.

So,

k (m_e c^2)^4 n c / (E^2 ε^2 ) ≈ 1/t_universe.

Solving for E:

E^2 ≈ k (m_e c^2)^4 n c t_universe / (ε^2 )

Taking square roots,

E ≈ sqrt( k * (m_e c^2)^4 * n c t_universe / ε^2 )

Let's plug in the numbers.

But I need to find the value of k. From pair production cross-section formulas, I think the exact coefficient might be known, but perhaps I can estimate it.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find an approximate formula for E. Let's proceed.

Given that ε is the CMB photon energy, which is given as 1e-3 eV.

n is the number density of CMB photons. Let me calculate that.

The number density of CMB photons can be calculated using the formula for a blackbody:

n_γ = (8 π^3)/(15 ζ(3)) ) * (k_B T / h c )^3 * g,

where g is the degrees of freedom (for photons, g = 2, because two polarizations), and ζ(3) is Apéry's constant ≈ 1.202.

At T=2.7 K:

k_B = 8.617e-5 eV/K,

h = 6.626e-27 erg s = 6.626e-34 J s,

c = 3e8 m/s,

But perhaps it's easier to compute in terms of eV.

Wait, another approach: The number density of CMB photons is approximately 411 photons/cm³, which is 411e6 photons/m³, or 411e6 *1e6 photons/m^3 = 4.11e14 photons/m³. Wait, no, 1 cm³ is 1e-6 m³. So if it's 411 photons/cm³, then per m³, it's 411 * 1e6 photons/m³ = 4.11e8 photons/m³.

So n = 4.11e8 photons/m³.

Now, let's plug in all the constants.

m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV = 0.511e6 eV.

ε = 1e-3 eV.

t_universe ≈ 4.3e17 seconds (approximately 13.8 billion years).

Let's compute E.

But I'm missing the value of k. From the cross-section formula, perhaps I can find k.

Wait, from the cross-section formula for γγ → e+ e- at high energies, the cross-section is approximately:

σ ≈ (4 π α^2)/(E^2) * (m_e c^2)^2/(ε E)

Wait, that would make σ ≈ (4 π α^2 (m_e c^2)^2 )/(E^3 ε )

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to find the cross-section expression.

Another approach: The cross-section for pair production by a gamma photon with a photon of energy ε is given by:

σ = (4 π α^2 m_e^2 c^4) / (E^2 ε) * [ (E ε)/(m_e^2 c^4) ) ]^2 / (something? )

Wait, perhaps I should recall that the cross-section for γγ → e+ e- is given by:

σ = (8 π α^2 m_e^4 c^6) / (E^4 ε^2) ) [ 1/( (E ε/(m_e^2 c^4 ))^2 + ... ) ]

But perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me instead refer to a known relation.

I remember that the cross-section for pair production via CMB photons for a gamma-ray of energy E is approximately:

σ ≈ (4 π α^2 m_e^4 c^6) / (E^2 ε^2 (E + ε) )

But maybe that's not the correct formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the cross-section is given by:

σ ≈ ( (4 π α^2 )/( 3 s ) ) * ( (s)/(4 m_e^2 c^4 ) )^2,

where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy, which is s = 4 E ε.

So s = 4 E ε.

Then,

σ = (4 π α^2 )/(3 * 4 E ε) ) * ( (4 E ε)/(4 m_e^2 c^4) )^2.

Simplify that:

= (4 π α^2 )/(12 E ε) ) * ( ( E ε )/( m_e^2 c^4 ) )^2.

= (π α^2 )/(3 E ε) ) * ( E^2 ε^2 )/( m_e^4 c^8 )

= (π α^2 )/(3 E ε) ) * ( E^2 ε^2 )/( m_e^4 c^8 )

= ( π α^2 E ε )/( 3 m_e^4 c^8 ) ).

Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in the algebra. Let me recheck.

Expanding the terms:

σ = (4 π α^2 / (3 * s)) * (s/(4 m_e^2 c^4))^2.

s is 4 E ε, so:

σ = (4 π α^2 / (3 * 4 E ε)) ) * ( (4 E ε)/(4 m_e^2 c^4) )^2.

Simplify denominator: 3*4 E ε = 12 E ε.

Inside the second term: (4 E ε / 4 m_e^2 c^4 ) = (E ε)/(m_e^2 c^4).

So the second term squared is (E^2 ε^2 )/(m_e^4 c^8 ).

Putting it all together:

σ = (4 π α^2 )/(12 E ε) ) * ( E^2 ε^2 )/( m_e^4 c^8 )

= (4 π α^2 E ε )/(12 m_e^4 c^8 )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

4 / 12 = 1/3, so:

σ = ( π α^2 E ε )/( 3 m_e^4 c^8 )

Wait, that's the cross-section. But this seems odd because when E is large, the cross-section increases with E, which seems counterintuitive because higher energy gammas should have lower cross-sections (like Rutherford scattering). Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, maybe the cross-section actually decreases with E, which would make sense because higher-energy gammas are less likely to interact. So perhaps I must have messed up the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the cross-section formula is σ ≈ (4 π α^2)/(s) * (s/(4 m_e^2 c^4 ))^2. Let me re-calculate that.

σ = [4 π α² / (4 E ε)] * [ (4 E ε)/(4 m_e^2 c^4 ) ]².

= [ π α² / (E ε) ] * [ (E ε) / (m_e^2 c^4 ) ]².

= π α² (E ε ) [ (E ε )^2 / (m_e^4 c^8 ) ) ] / ( E ε )

= π α² (E ε ) * (E² ε² )/( m_e^4 c^8 ) ) / (E ε )

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me compute it step by step.

After substitution, the formula is:

σ = [4 π α²/(4 E ε)] * [ (4 E ε )/(4 m_e^2 c^4 ) ]^2.

First term: [4 π α² / (4 E ε)] = (π α²) / (E ε).

Second term: [ (4 E ε )/(4 m_e^2 c^4 ) ]² = [ (E ε) / (m_e^2 c^4 ) ]² = (E² ε²) / (m_e^4 c^8 ).

So multiply them together:

σ = [ (π α²)/(E ε) ) ] * [ (E² ε²)/( m_e^4 c^8 ) ) ]

= π α² * E² ε² / ( E ε m_e^4 c^8 )

= π α² E ε / ( m_e^4 c^8 )

So the cross-section σ is proportional to E ε.

Wait, that's interesting. So as E increases, σ increases linearly. But that seems to contradict what I thought earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the cross-section is non-zero only when E ε ≥ (m_e c^2 )^2, which is our threshold condition. So the cross-section is σ = (4 π α²)/(3 s) ) * ( s/(4 m_e^2 c^4 ) )^2.

At s =4 E ε, and when E ε is much larger than m_e² c^4, the cross-section would scale as σ ≈ (4 π α² )/(s ) * (s^2 )/( (4 m_e^2 c^4 )^2 )

= (4 π α² s )/( (4 m_e^2 c^4 )^2 )

= (4 π α² )/( 16 m_e^4 c^8 ) ) * s

= ( π α² )/(4 m_e^4 c^8 ) ) * s.

But s =4 E ε, so:

σ ≈ ( π α² *4 E ε )/(4 m_e^4 c^8 )

= ( π α² E ε ) / ( m_e^4 c^8 )

Which is the same as before: σ proportional to E ε.

This seems to suggest that the cross-section increases with E, which would imply that higher-energy gammas interact more, which is counterintuitive. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I should instead think about the cross-section scaling. I think for γγ → e+e-, the cross-section at high energies (E >> m_e c^2) scales as σ ~ (m_e c^2 )^4/(E^2 ε). So that as E increases, σ decreases as 1/E^2.

Wait, that makes more sense. So perhaps I should use σ ≈ ( (4 π α^2 )/(3) ) * ( (m_e c^2 )^4 )/( E^2 ε ) ). Let me check that.

Wait, another source I've read in the past suggests that the cross-section for pair production by a photon with a background photon is given by:

σ ≈ ( (4 π α^2 )/( 3 E^2 ) ) * (m_e c^2 )^4/( (E ε)^2 )

Wait, that would make sigma proportional to (m_e c^2 )^4/(E^4 ε^2 ), which decreases with E^4. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should refer to the classic paper by Primakoff and others, but I don't have that on hand.

Alternatively, perhaps the cross-section is inversely proportional to E^2. So, σ ∝ (m_e c^2 )^4/(E^2 ε^2 ). So let's proceed with this assumption.

So σ ≈ (k (m_e c^2 )^4 )/( E^2 ε^2 ), where k is a dimensionless constant.

Then, the interaction rate Γ = σ n c.

Set Γ = 1/(t_universe), so:

σ n c = 1/t_universe.

Substituting σ:

( k (m_e c^2 )^4 n c ) / ( E^2 ε^2 ) ) = 1/t_universe.

Solve for E:

E^2 = k (m_e c^2 )^4 n c t_universe / ( ε^2 ).

Taking square roots,

E = sqrt( k (m_e c^2 )^4 n c t_universe ) / ε.

Now, plug in the numbers.

But what is the value of k? I think k is a constant that comes from the cross-section formula, perhaps something like 4 π α^2/3. Let me assume k = 4 π α^2/3.

So,

E = sqrt( (4 π α^2/3) * (m_e c^2 )^4 * n * c * t_universe ) / ε.

Now, let's compute each term.

Compute each constant:

α ≈ 1/137 ≈ 0.007297.

m_e c^2 = 0.511e6 eV.

n = 4.11e8 photons/m³.

c = 3e8 m/s.

t_universe ≈ 4.3e17 seconds.

ε = 1e-3 eV.

Compute each part step by step.

First, compute (m_e c^2)^4:

(0.511e6 eV)^4 = (5.11e5 eV)^4.

= (5.11)^4 * (1e5)^4 eV^4.

5.11^4 ≈ 5.11 *5.11=26.11; 26.11 *5.11≈133.3; 133.3*5.11≈680. So approx 680.

(1e5)^4 = 1e20.

So (m_e c^2)^4 ≈ 680e20 eV^4 = 6.8e22 eV^4.

Now, compute the numerator under the square root:

(4 π α^2 /3) * (m_e c^2 )^4 * n * c * t_universe.

Let's compute each term:

4 π ≈ 12.566.

α^2 ≈ (0.007297)^2 ≈ 5.32e-5.

(m_e c^2 )^4 = 6.8e22 eV^4.

n =4.11e8 photons/m³.

c=3e8 m/s.

t_universe=4.3e17 s.

So,

(4 π α^2 /3 ) ≈ (12.566 * 5.32e-5 ) /3 ≈ (6.67e-4 ) /3 ≈ 2.22e-4.

So,

(4 π α^2 /3 ) ≈ 2.22e-4.

Now, multiply all terms:

2.22e-4 * 6.8e22 eV^4 * 4.11e8 photons/m³ *3e8 m/s *4.3e17 s.

Wait, but photons/m³ is a number density, so it's unitless in terms of counts per volume. Let's proceed with the calculation:

Compute the numerical part:

2.22e-4 * 6.8e22 = 2.22e-4 *6.8e22 = (2.22 *6.8) * 1e18 ≈ 15.096e18 ≈ 1.5096e19.

Multiply by 4.11e8: 1.5096e19 *4.11e8 = 6.207e27.

Multiply by 3e8: 6.207e27 *3e8 = 1.862e36.

Multiply by4.3e17: 1.862e36 *4.3e17 ≈ 8.00e53.

So the numerator under the square root is 8e53 eV^4 * m/s * s * photons/m³?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing units here. Let me see:

Each term:

(m_e c^2 )^4 is (eV)^4.

n is photons/m³ → unitless? Or is it in m^-3.

c is m/s.

t is s.

So,

(m_e c^2 )^4 → eV^4.

n → m^-3.

c → m/s.

t → s.

So the entire unit is eV^4 * m^-3 * (m/s) * s → eV^4 * m^-3 * m → eV^4 * m^-2.

So the entire numerator has units of eV^4 m^-2.

But when we take the square root, it would be sqrt( eV^4 m^-2 ) ) = eV^2 m^-1.

Wait, but we're dividing by ε, which is in eV.

So the entire expression E has units of (eV^2 m^-1 ) / eV ) = eV m^-1.

But energy has units of eV, so perhaps I'm missing something here. Maybe I should proceed numerically.

But perhaps the calculation is getting too messy. Let me proceed with the numerical value.

We have the numerator under the square root as 8e53 eV^4 * m^-2.

Wait, no, wait: let's recompute the units.

Wait, the numerator is (4 π α^2/3) * (m_e c^2)^4 * n * c * t.

Which is:

( (dimensionless) ) * (eV^4) * (m^-3) ) * ( m/s ) * ( s )

= eV^4 m^-3 * m/s * s.

The m/s and s cancel, leaving m^-2.

So the numerator is 8e53 eV^4 m^-2.

Taking the square root gives sqrt(8e53 eV^4 m^-2) ) = sqrt(8e53) * eV^2 m^-1.

sqrt(8e53) = sqrt(8)*1e26.5 ≈ 2.828 * 3.16e26 ≈ 8.94e26.

So sqrt(8e53) ≈ 8.94e26.

So the numerator under the square root is 8.94e26 eV² m⁻¹.

Now, E is this value divided by ε, which is 1e-3 eV.

E ≈ (8.94e26 eV² m⁻¹) / (1e-3 eV) ) = 8.94e29 eV m⁻¹.

But eV/m is equivalent to (eV s)/(m c), since c = m/s. Hmm, but perhaps this is getting too confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try to compute the logarithm.

Wait, perhaps I should use natural units where c=1 and ħ=1, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should just compute E in eV.

Wait, the units are a bit messy, but perhaps I can proceed numerically.

So, the numerator under the square root is 8e53 eV^4 m^-2.

Taking the square root gives:

sqrt(8e53) ≈ 8.94e26.

So the numerator is 8.94e26 eV² m⁻¹.

Now, divide by ε = 1e-3 eV.

E = 8.94e26 eV² m⁻¹ / (1e-3 eV ) = 8.94e29 eV m⁻¹.

But eV m⁻¹ is equivalent to (eV s) / (m c ), because c = m/s → s = m/(c).

Wait, perhaps I should convert eV m⁻¹ to GeV.

Wait, 1 eV m⁻¹ = 1e-9 GeV m⁻¹.

Hmm, but perhaps it's easier to compute the numerical value in eV.

Wait, 8.94e29 eV m⁻¹ is actually 8.94e29 eV per meter.

But that's not a standard unit. I think I must have made a mistake in the dimensional analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute E in eV by considering the units correctly.

Wait, let me think about units again.

The expression:

E = sqrt( (4 π α^2/3) * (m_e c^2 )^4 * n * c * t_universe ) / ε.

So,

(4 π α^2/3) is dimensionless.

(m_e c^2 )^4 is (eV)^4.

n is per m³, so m^-3.

c is m/s.

t is seconds.

So,

(m_e c^2 )^4 * n * c * t → eV^4 * m^-3 * m/s * s → eV^4 * m^-2.

So the entire numerator inside the sqrt has units eV^4 m^-2.

Taking the square root gives eV^2 m^-1.

Divided by ε (eV) → eV^2 m^-1 / eV = eV m^-1.

Wait, but what's eV m^-1 in terms of energy? Because E has units of eV.

Hmm, perhaps there's a missing factor of c here. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps I should have included more accurate unit analysis. Let me try again.

The cross-section σ has units of cm².

Wait, but in our calculation, we have n in m^-3, which is 1e6 cm^-3.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute using cm instead of m to avoid confusion.

Let me try again with n in cm^-3.

n = 411 photons/cm³ =411e6 photons/m³ = 411e6 / (1e6 cm³/m³) )= 411 photons/cm³.

Wait, no, 1 m³ = (100 cm)^3 = 1e6 cm³. So 411 photons/cm³ is 411e6 photons/m³.

Ok, but perhaps it's better to work in cgs units.

But maybe it's getting too complicated, and I'm running out of time. Let's proceed numerically.

Wait, plugging in the numbers into the equation:

E ≈ sqrt( k * (m_e c^2)^4 * n * c * t_universe ) / ε.

Assuming k is about (4 pi alpha^2/3) ≈ 2.22e-4 as before.

With the numbers plugged in:

E ≈ sqrt( 2.22e-4 * (0.511e6 eV)^4 * 4.11e8 photons/m³ * 3e8 m/s *4.3e17 s ) / (1e-3 eV).

But let me compute the exponent:

(m_e c^2)^4 = (0.511e6)^4 = (5.11e5)^4 = (5.11)^4 * (1e5)^4 = 680 * 1e20 = 6.8e22.

n =4.11e8 photons/m³.

c=3e8 m/s.

t=4.3e17 s.

Epsilon=1e-3 eV.

Putting it all together:

Inside the sqrt:

2.22e-4 * 6.8e22 * 4.11e8 *3e8 *4.3e17.

Compute each step:

Multiply 2.22e-4 *6.8e22 = 2.22e-4 *6.8e22 = (2.22 *6.8) * 1e18 ≈ 15.096e18.

Multiply by 4.11e8: 15.096e18 *4.11e8 = 6.20e27.

Multiply by 3e8: 6.20e27 *3e8 = 1.86e36.

Multiply by4.3e17: 1.86e36 *4.3e17 = 8.0e53.

So inside the sqrt is 8e53.

So sqrt(8e53) = (8e53)^(1/2) = sqrt(8) * 1e26.5 = 2.828 * 3.16e26 ≈ 8.94e26.

So E = 8.94e26 / (1e-3) = 8.94e29 eV.

Wait, 8.94e29 eV is 8.94e29 eV, but 1e9 eV is 1 GeV. So 8.94e29 eV is 8.94e20 GeV.

But this is way higher than the options given, which are on the order of 1e5 GeV.

Hmm, so I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units for the number density n. Let me check that again.

Wait, the CMB photon number density is about 411 photons/cm³, which is 411e6 photons/m³ (since 1 cm³ = 1e-6 m³, so 411 * 1e6 =411e6 photons/m³).

So n=4.11e8 photons/m³ is correct.

But wait, wait another moment. The number density n is 411 photons/cm³. There are 1e6 cm³ in a m³, so n =411 * 1e6 =4.11e8 photons/m³.

Yes, correct.

Hmm, perhaps the cross-section formula is different. Maybe I should use the formula where the cross-section is proportional to 1/E^2, not E.

Let me think again. If σ is proportional to (m_e c^2)^4/(E^2 ε^2 ), then the expression for E would be.

E^2 = k (m_e c^2)^4 n c t_universe / ( ε^2 ) .

So E = sqrt( k (m_e c^2)^4 n c t ) / ε.

Wait, but if I proceed with the same numbers except that in the cross-section the E is in the denominator squared, then the numerator would be (m_e c^2)^4, and the denominator E^2.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a known formula or approach.

Another approach: Use the formula for the interaction length.

L = 1/(n σ).

The lifetime is limited when the interaction length L is comparable to the size of the universe. The size of the universe is roughly c * t_universe.

So, L ≈ c t_universe → 1/(n σ) ≈ c t_universe → σ ≈ 1/(n c t_universe).

So σ ≈ 1/(n c t_universe ).

Now, if σ is given by (something) * (m_e c^2 )^4/( E^2 ε^2 ), then:

( something ) * (m_e c^2 )^4/( E^2 ε^2 ) ≈ 1/(n c t_universe )

Solving for E:

E^2 ≈ (something) (m_e c^2 )^4 n c t_universe / ε^2.

So,

E ≈ sqrt( [something] (m_e c^2 )^4 n c t_universe ) / ε.

Let me compute this again with [something] being a constant.

But I'm back to the same calculation as before, which gave E ≈ 8.94e29 eV, which is 8.94e20 GeV. But this is not matching any of the options given.

Wait, the options are all around 1e5 GeV, so either I'm missing a factor or made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the assumption that the cross-section scales as (m_e c^2 )^4/(E^2 ε^2 ) is incorrect, and the correct scaling is different.

Another thought: perhaps the cross-section scales as 1/(E ε ), since the cross-section for pair production tends to decrease with higher energies.

Wait, another approach: the cross-section σ for γγ → e+ e- is given by:

σ = (4 π α^2)/(s) * (s/(4 m_e^2 c^4 ))^2,

where s=4 E ε.

So,

σ = (4 π α^2 )/(4 E ε ) ) * ( (4 E ε)/(4 m_e^2 c^4 ) )^2.

Simplify:

= (π α^2 )/(E ε ) ) * ( (E ε )/( m_e^2 c^4 ) )^2.

= (π α^2 E ε )/( m_e^4 c^8 ) * (E^2 ε^2 )/( m_e^4 c^8 ) → no, that's incorrect.

Wait, let me recompute.

( (4 E ε )/(4 m_e^2 c^4 ) )^2 = ( E ε / (m_e^2 c^4 ) )^2 = (E^2 ε^2 )/( m_e^4 c^8 ).

So,

σ = [ (4 π α^2 )/(4 E ε) ) ] * [ (E^2 ε^2 )/( m_e^4 c^8 ) ) ]

= ( π α^2 )/( E ε ) ) * ( E^2 ε^2 )/( m_e^4 c^8 )

= ( π α^2 E ε )/( m_e^4 c^8 )

So σ is proportional to E ε.

But that's strange because as E increases, σ increases, which seems wrong.

Wait, but perhaps this is only valid when E ε is much larger than m_e^4 c^8. But if E increases, and ε is fixed, then σ increases, which would imply that higher-energy gammas are more likely to interact, which is the opposite of what I expected.

This suggests that at higher energies, the cross-section increases, which would mean that high-energy gammas interact more, leading to shorter lifetimes. But this would imply that high-energy gammas have their lifetimes limited, which aligns with the question.

But according to our earlier calculation, the energy E we found was way too high, so perhaps I should see which option is closest.

Our calculation gave E ≈ 8.94e20 GeV, which is way beyond the options provided (all are ~1e5 GeV). So I must have made a mistake in the cross-section formula.

Wait, perhaps I should try using the formula where σ is inversely proportional to E.

Let me try instead assuming that σ ∝ 1/E.

In that case, the expression would be:

E^2 = k (m_e c^2 )^4 n c t_universe ε^2 / ε^2 → E^2 = k (m_e c^2 )^4 n c t_universe.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps the correct cross-section is sigma = [ (4 π α^2 )/( 3 s ) ] * [ s/(4 m_e^2 c^4 ) ]^2.

Substituting s=4 E ε,

sigma = [ (4 π α^2 )/( 12 E ε ) ] * [ (4 E ε )/(4 m_e^2 c^4 ) ]^2.

Simplify:

= [ ( π α^2 )/( 3 E ε ) ] * [ ( E ε )/( m_e^2 c^4 ) ]^2.

= [ π α^2 E ε )/( 3 m_e^4 c^8 ) ].

Which brings me back to sigma being proportional to E ε.

Hmm. With this, the calculation again gives E ~ 1e20 GeV, which is way too high.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the gamma's lifetime is limited when the interaction probability per unit length is ~1, i.e., the optical depth tau ~1. So tau = n sigma L ~1, where L is the path length.

But L is the size of the universe, which is c t_universe.

So tau = n sigma c t_universe.

Set tau =1,

n sigma c t_universe =1,

sigma =1/(n c t_universe).

If sigma is given by sigma = [ (4 π alpha^2 )/(3 s ) ] * (s/(4 m_e^2 c^4 ))^2,

then,

sigma = [ (4 π alpha^2 )/(3 *4 E ε ) ] * [ (4 E ε )/(4 m_e^2 c^4 ) ]^2.

= [ π alpha^2/(3 E ε ) ] * [ ( E ε )^2/( m_e^4 c^8 ) ].

= [ π alpha^2 E ε ]/( 3 m_e^4 c^8 ).

Set equal to 1/(n c t_universe ):

[ π alpha^2 E ε ]/( 3 m_e^4 c^8 ) = 1/(n c t_universe )

Solve for E:

E = [ 3 m_e^4 c^8 )/( π alpha^2 ε n c t_universe ) ].

Simplify,

E = [ 3 m_e^4 c^7 )/( π alpha^2 ε n t_universe ) ].

Now, plug in the numbers.

Compute each part:

m_e c^2 = 0.511e6 eV → m_e = 0.511e6 eV / (c^2). But since we're working in units where c=1 for energy calculations, m_e =0.511e6 eV.

But perhaps it's better to compute m_e in eV s²/m² (since energy E = mc^2 → m = E/(c^2)).

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute everything in terms of eV and seconds.

But this could take a long time. Let me try to compute each term.

m_e^4: (0.511e6 eV )^4 = (5.11e5 eV)^4 = (5.11)^4 * (1e5)^4 eV^4.

As before, 5.11^4 ≈680, (1e5)^4=1e20 → m_e^4 ≈6.8e22 eV^4.

c^7: (3e8 m/s )^7 → but perhaps in eV terms, c^2 is (3e8 m/s )^2 ≈9e16 m²/s².

But perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me proceed numerically.

Compute each term:

3 =3.

m_e^4 =6.8e22 eV^4.

c^7 = (3e8 m/s )^7 = 3^7 *1e56 m^7/s^7 = 2187e56 = 2.187e59 m^7/s^7.

pi ≈3.1416.

alpha^2 ≈ (1/137)^2≈5.3e-5.

epsilon=1e-3 eV.

n=4.11e8 photons/m³.

t_universe=4.3e17 s.

Now,

E = [3 * m_e^4 * c^7 ] / [ pi alpha^2 epsilon n t_universe ]

= [3 *6.8e22 eV^4 *2.187e59 m^7/s^7 ] / [3.1416 *5.3e-5 *1e-3 eV *4.11e8 photons/m^3 *4.3e17 s ]

Compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator:

3 *6.8e22 =2.04e23.

2.04e23 *2.187e59 = 4.45e82.

Units: eV^4 m^7/s^7.

Denominator:

3.1416 *5.3e-5 =1.67e-4.

1.67e-4 *1e-3=1.67e-7.

1.67e-7 *4.11e8= 6.89e1.

6.89e1 *4.3e17= 2.95e19.

Units: (m^-3 s ) because:

epsilon (eV) * n (m^-3) * t (s) → eV m^-3 s.

Wait, but the denominator in E is:

[pi alpha^2 epsilon n t_universe ] → (eV^0) because:

alpha is dimensionless,

epsilon is eV,

n is m^-3,

t is s.

So,

denominator has units of eV * m^-3 * s.

So overall, denominator is 2.95e19 eV m^-3 s.

Now, E = numerator/denominator = (4.45e82 eV^4 m^7/s^7 ) ) / (2.95e19 eV m^-3 s ).

Simplify units:

eV^4 / eV = eV^3.

m^7 / m^-3 = m^10.

s^-7 / s = s^-8.

So,

E = (4.45e82 / 2.95e19 ) * eV^3 m^10 s^-8.

Compute 4.45e82 / 2.95e19 ≈ 1.508e63.

So,

E ≈1.508e63 eV^3 m^10 s^-8.

But this doesn't make sense because E has units of energy, which should be eV. So I must have made a mistake in the unit analysis.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently, considering that the cross-section approach is getting too complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way using the condition that the product of the gamma energy and the CMB photon energy must be above a certain threshold.

Earlier, we found that the threshold condition is E * ε >= (m_e c^2 )^2.

Which gives E >= (m_e c^2 )^2 / ε.

Plugging in the numbers:

(0.511e6 eV )^2 / (1e-3 eV ) = (0.511e6 )^2 /1e-3 = 0.511^2 *1e12 /1e-3 = 0.261 *1e15 = 2.61e14 eV.

Which is 2.61e14 eV = 2.61e5 GeV.

Which corresponds to option C) 2.6e5 GeV.

So the correct answer should be option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the energy of high-energy gamma-rays whose lifetimes in the universe are limited by their annihilation with CMB photons, following the process $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$. The key is to analyze the interaction rate and the threshold energy for this process.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Threshold Condition**:  
   For the annihilation process to occur, the center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}$ must satisfy $\sqrt{s} \geq 2m_e c^2$, where $m_e$ is the electron mass. The center-of-mass energy is given by $s = 4E_\gamma \epsilon$, where $E_\gamma$ is the gamma-ray energy and $\epsilon$ is the CMB photon energy. Substituting $\sqrt{s} \geq 2m_e c^2$, the threshold condition becomes:  
   \[
   E_\gamma \epsilon \geq (m_e c^2)^2
   \]

2. **Solving for $E_\gamma$**:  
   Rearranging the threshold condition to solve for $E_\gamma$:  
   \[
   E_\gamma \geq \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{\epsilon}
   \]  
   Substituting $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 0.511 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV}$ and $\epsilon = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$:  
   \[
   E_\gamma \geq \frac{(0.511 \times 10^6)^2}{10^{-3}} = \frac{0.261 \times 10^{12}}{10^{-3}} = 0.261 \times 10^{15} \, \text{eV}
   \]  
   Converting to GeV ($1 \, \text{GeV} = 10^9 \, \text{eV}$):  
   \[
   E_\gamma \geq 0.261 \times 10^6 \, \text{GeV} = 2.61 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}
   \]

3. **Matching the Options**:  
   The calculated threshold energy $E_\gamma \approx 2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$ corresponds to **Option C**. This represents the energy at which the lifetime of gamma-rays is limited by their interaction with CMB photons.

### Conclusion:
The energy of gamma-rays whose lifetimes are limited by the annihilation process $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$ is approximately $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$. This matches **Option C**.

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about the annihilation of high-energy gamma-rays with photons from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). The process is gamma gamma annihilation producing electron-positron pairs: γγ → e+ e-. The question is asking from what energy gamma-rays their lifetimes in the universe would be limited by this process. We're told the average photon energy of the CMB is 1e-3 eV.

Hmm, I remember that the CMB is this radiation leftover from the Big Bang, and it's almost uniform in all directions. The average photon energy is given as 1e-3 eV. Now, gamma-rays are high-energy photons, so when a gamma-ray interacts with a CMB photon, they can annihilate into an electron-positron pair if certain conditions are met.

I think this has to do with cross-sections and interaction probabilities. The lifetime of a gamma-ray would be limited by how often it interacts with the CMB photons. If the interaction rate is high enough, the gamma-ray won't travel far before annihilating, thus limiting its lifetime.

Wait, I remember that the interaction rate depends on the cross-section and the number of target photons. The cross-section for this process must depend on the energy of the gamma-ray and the CMB photon. Also, the CMB photon's energy is much smaller, so maybe the gamma's energy is the main variable here.

I think the cross-section for γγ → e+ e- has a certain dependence on the energy. From what I recall, the cross-section for two photons annihilating into a pair peaks when the combined energy is at least twice the electron mass (since E=mc², 2*0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV). But since the CMB photon is so low energy (1e-3 eV), the gamma-ray must be high enough so that when it interacts with the CMB photon, the total energy meets this threshold.

Wait, but the cross-section for this process is probably proportional to some power of the photon energies. I think at high energies, the cross-section for γγ → e+ e- scales with the logarithm of the energy, but I'm not too sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a threshold process where the cross-section increases once the energy is above a certain value.

Alternatively, I remember that the optical depth τ is a measure of the probability that a photon will interact. The optical depth is the product of the cross-section σ, the number density n of target photons, and the path length L. So τ = σ * n * L. If τ is large, the interaction probability is high.

The lifetime of the gamma-ray would be limited when the interaction rate is significant. The mean lifetime would be inversely proportional to the interaction rate, so τ ~ 1/(σ n). Wait, no. The mean free time τ is 1/(σ n). So the lifetime is limited when τ is comparable to the age of the universe or something like that.

Wait, the age of the universe is about 13.8 billion years, which is roughly 4e17 seconds. But perhaps I don't need to plug that in directly because the problem might involve a relation where the energies are related through the cross-section and the CMB photon density.

The CMB photon density is n = energy density / (energy per photon). The energy density of the CMB is about 1e-4 erg/cm³, but I might need to convert that into photons per cm³. Alternatively, I can think in terms of number density n. The CMB photon number density can be approximated as n ≈ 1e8 photons/cm³. Wait, I think it's about 410 photons per cubic centimeter at present, but that's about 4e-4 photons per cm³? Hmm, maybe I should be precise.

Wait, the CMB temperature is about 2.7 K. The number density of photons is given by the photon density formula, which comes from the blackbody spectrum. The number density is n = (8 π / (15)) (k_B T)^3 / (h^3 c^3) ) * (something like that). Let me think.

The formula for the number density of photons in a blackbody is n = (g_{\gamma} / 2) * (2 \pi^2) (k_B T / h c)^3 * zeta(3), where g_{\gamma} is the degrees of freedom (which is 2 for photons, spin 1, two polarizations), zeta(3) is Apéry's constant, approximately 1.202.

Wait, let me recall: the number density of photons is given by n_γ = (8 π^5 k_B^4 T^3 )/(15 h^3 c^3) ) * (1/(ζ(3))} )? Or is it another factor? Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to remember that for T = 2.7 K, the number density n is about 411 photons per cm³. Oh, wait, wait, no, that can't be right because the value I remember is around 4e8 photons per m³, which is 4e5 per liter. Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up units.

Alternatively, the photon number density is given by n_γ = ( (8 π^2) / (15) ) (k_B T / h c )^3 * (g_{\gamma}/2) * ζ(3) )^{-1} ?

Wait, maybe I should just look for the number density of the CMB. I think at the current time, the CMB photon number density is about 411 photons per cubic centimetre. So 411 photons/cm³ is 411e6 photons/m³ because 1 cm³ is 1e-6 m³. Wait, no, wait: 1 m³ is (100 cm)^3 = 1e6 cm³. So if there are 411 photons per cm³, then per m³ it's 411e6 photons/m³.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to proceed with the calculation without getting exact numbers, but using the given average photon energy.

The average energy of CMB photons is given as 1e-3 eV. So each photon has about that energy. So the energy density u_γ is n_γ * average energy per photon. So u_γ = n_γ * E_avg.

But wait, the problem says the average photon energy is 1e-3 eV. So E_avg = 1e-3 eV.

If I can find n_γ, the number density, then I can proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps I don't need the exact number because the problem might be solved using an approximate relation.

Wait, the process is γ + γ → e+ e-. The cross-section for this process for a gamma and a CMB photon is given by some function of their energies.

The cross-section σ is a function of the center-of-mass energy sqrt(s), where s is the square of the total energy in the center-of-mass frame. For the pair production to happen, the center-of-mass energy must be at least 2 m_e c², because that's the rest mass energy of the electron and positron. m_e c² is about 0.511 MeV, so 2 m_e c² is about 1.022 MeV.

So, sqrt(s) >= 2 m_e c². Let me write that down:

s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2 (but since they're moving in opposite directions, their momenta are opposite, so p2 = -p1, so the vector sum is zero). Wait, no, because the photons are moving in opposite directions, their momenta are opposite. Wait, no. Wait, in the rest frame of the two photons, their momenta are back to back. Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, for two photons, the total energy squared is s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c - p2 c)^2.

Wait, for photons, E = p c, so E1 = p1 c, E2 = p2 c. Let me suppose that the gamma photon has energy E, and the CMB photon has energy ε. Let me assume that the two photons are moving in opposite directions. Then, the total energy is E + ε, and the total momentum is (E/(c)) - (ε/(c)) in the direction of the gamma photon. So the invariant s is s = (E + ε)^2 - [ (E - ε) ) ]^2 c². Wait, no, because the momentum is E/(c) in the gamma's direction, and -ε/(c) in the opposite direction. So the vector sum is (E - ε)/c in the gamma's direction. So the invariant s is (E + ε)^2 - ( (E - ε)/c )^2 c^2. So s = (E + ε)^2 - (E - ε)^2.

Calculating that: (E + ε)^2 = E² + 2 E ε + ε².

(E - ε)^2 = E² - 2 E ε + ε².

So s = E² + 2 E ε + ε² - E² + 2 E ε - ε².

Wait, wait, no. Because s is (E_total)^2 - (p_total c)^2.

Wait, E_total is E + ε.

p_total is (E/(c)) (since the gamma photon momentum is E/c in its direction) minus (ε/(c)) (since the CMB photon is moving opposite, so its momentum is -ε/(c)).

So p_total = (E - ε)/c.

So then, s = (E + ε)^2 - ( (E - ε)/c )^2 c².

Which simplifies to:

s = (E + ε)^2 - (E - ε)^2.

Expanding both:

(E + ε)^2 = E² + 2 E ε + ε².

(E - ε)^2 = E² - 2 E ε + ε².

Subtracting, s = [E² + 2 E ε + ε²] - [E² - 2 E ε + ε²] = 4 E ε.

So s = 4 E ε.

Then, sqrt(s) is 2 sqrt(E ε).

For pair production to occur, we need sqrt(s) >= 2 m_e c².

So 2 sqrt(E ε) >= 2 m_e c².

Dividing both sides by 2, sqrt(E ε) >= m_e c².

Squaring both sides: E ε >= (m_e c²)^2.

So the condition is E * ε >= (m_e c²)^2.

But wait, in the problem, the average CMB photon energy is ε = 1e-3 eV. So E is the gamma-ray energy. So the condition for the process to be possible is E >= (m_e c²)^2 / ε.

Wait, but wait, let's compute that.

m_e c^2 is 0.511 MeV = 0.511e6 eV.

So (m_e c^2)^2 = (0.511e6 eV)^2 = (0.511e6)^2 eV².

Divide that by ε = 1e-3 eV.

So E >= (0.511e6)^2 / 1e-3 = (0.511e6)^2 * 1e3.

Calculating that:

(0.511e6)^2 = (5.11e5)^2 = (5.11)^2 * 1e10 = 26.1121 * 1e10 = 2.61121e11.

Multiply by 1e3: 2.61121e14 eV.

Wait, but 1 GeV is 1e9 eV. So 2.61121e14 eV is 2.61121e5 GeV.

Wait, but that's a very high energy. The options are on the order of 1e5 GeV. Let's check the options.

Option C is 2.6e5 GeV, which matches this calculation. So, the gamma-rays with energy E ~ (m_e c^2)^2 / ε would be the threshold for this process. But wait, the question isn't about the threshold but the energy at which their lifetimes are limited by this process. So perhaps the cross-section increases at higher energies, so higher-energy gammas interact more, leading to shorter lifetimes.

But perhaps the gamma-ray's lifetime is limited when the interaction rate equals a critical rate, like when the mean free time equals the age of the universe. But perhaps the calculation is about finding the energy where the interaction probability is non-negligible, so the lifetime is significantly reduced.

Alternatively, the problem might be using the concept of the interaction cross-section and photon density to find the energy where the mean free path becomes comparable to the size of the universe, making the optical depth significant. But perhaps the calculation boils down to E ~ (m_e c^2)^2 / (ε * n_γ c * ... )

Wait, perhaps I should consider the mean free time τ = 1/(σ n), where σ is the cross-section and n is the number density of target photons.

The lifetime is limited when τ is comparable to the age of the universe, say τ ~ t_universe.

But perhaps for high-energy gammas, the cross-section σ is given by the threshold cross-section, which is proportional to (m_e c^2)^4 / (E^2 ε^2). Because in the cross-section for pair production, when E >> m_e c^2, the cross-section scales as σ ~ (m_e c^2)^2/(E^2 ε) * something. Alternatively, at the threshold, the cross-section is a minimum, and above that, it increases.

Wait, I think the cross-section for γγ → e+ e- is given approximately by σ ≈ ( (4 π α^2 )/(3 s) ) * (s/(4 m_e^2 c^4 ))^2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I've heard that the cross-section for pair production on the CMB scales as σ ∝ (m_e c^2)^4/(E^2 ε), where E is the gamma energy and ε is the CMB photon energy. So σ ≈ (4 π α^2 )/( (E ε )^2 ) * (m_e c^2)^4/(s) ), but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula for the interaction rate. The interaction rate Γ is σ n c, where n is the number density of CMB photons, and c is the speed of light.

Then, the lifetime τ is 1/Γ. For the lifetime to be limited by this process, τ should be on the order of the age of the universe, t_universe ~ 1e18 seconds.

So, Γ = σ n c.

We want τ ≈ t_universe → Γ ≈ 1/t_universe.

So, σ n c ≈ 1/t_universe.

But the cross-section σ depends on the energy E of the gamma and the CMB photon energy ε. So let's model σ.

From pair production theory, the cross-section for two photons producing an electron-positron pair is given by:

σ(E, ε) = (4 π/3) * (α^2/(E ε)) * ( (m_e c^2)^2 )^2 / ( (E ε)^2 ) )

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to use the formula:

σ(E, ε) = (4 π α^2 )/( s ) * ( (s)/(4 m_e^2 c^4) )^2,

where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy, s = 4 E ε.

Wait, maybe I should find an approximate expression for the cross-section.

Another approach I recall: the cross-section for γγ → e+ e- is given by:

σ ≈ (8 π^2 α^2 m_e^4 c^4 )/( (E γ)^2 (E_cm)^2 )

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look for the relation between the cross-section and the energy.

Alternatively, I remember that the cross-section for the process γγ → e+ e- can be approximated as σ ≈ (4 π α^2)/(E_γ^2) * (m_e c^2)^2/(ε E_γ) )

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the threshold. The cross-section is non-zero only when the center-of-mass energy is above 2 m_e c², which we've already established requires E γ ε >= (m_e c^2)^2.

But since the cross-section above the threshold increases with energy, but I'm not certain about the exact dependence.

Alternatively, considering that the cross-section σ is inversely proportional to E^2, because at high energies, the cross-section decreases as 1/E^2. So, σ ~ (m_e c^2)^4/(E^2 ε^2), perhaps? Because the threshold condition is E ε >= (m_e c^2)^2.

So, σ = k * (m_e c^2)^4/(E^2 ε^2 ), where k is some constant.

Then, substituting into the interaction rate:

Γ = σ n c = [k (m_e c^2)^4/(E^2 ε^2 ) ] * n * c.

We can set Γ ≈ 1/t_universe.

So,

k (m_e c^2)^4 n c / (E^2 ε^2 ) ≈ 1/t_universe.

Solving for E:

E^2 ≈ k (m_e c^2)^4 n c t_universe / (ε^2 )

Taking square roots,

E ≈ sqrt( k * (m_e c^2)^4 * n c t_universe / ε^2 )

Let's plug in the numbers.

But I need to find the value of k. From pair production cross-section formulas, I think the exact coefficient might be known, but perhaps I can estimate it.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find an approximate formula for E. Let's proceed.

Given that ε is the CMB photon energy, which is given as 1e-3 eV.

n is the number density of CMB photons. Let me calculate that.

The number density of CMB photons can be calculated using the formula for a blackbody:

n_γ = (8 π^3)/(15 ζ(3)) ) * (k_B T / h c )^3 * g,

where g is the degrees of freedom (for photons, g = 2, because two polarizations), and ζ(3) is Apéry's constant ≈ 1.202.

At T=2.7 K:

k_B = 8.617e-5 eV/K,

h = 6.626e-27 erg s = 6.626e-34 J s,

c = 3e8 m/s,

But perhaps it's easier to compute in terms of eV.

Wait, another approach: The number density of CMB photons is approximately 411 photons/cm³, which is 411e6 photons/m³, or 411e6 *1e6 photons/m^3 = 4.11e14 photons/m³. Wait, no, 1 cm³ is 1e-6 m³. So if it's 411 photons/cm³, then per m³, it's 411 * 1e6 photons/m³ = 4.11e8 photons/m³.

So n = 4.11e8 photons/m³.

Now, let's plug in all the constants.

m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV = 0.511e6 eV.

ε = 1e-3 eV.

t_universe ≈ 4.3e17 seconds (approximately 13.8 billion years).

Let's compute E.

But I'm missing the value of k. From the cross-section formula, perhaps I can find k.

Wait, from the cross-section formula for γγ → e+ e- at high energies, the cross-section is approximately:

σ ≈ (4 π α^2)/(E^2) * (m_e c^2)^2/(ε E)

Wait, that would make σ ≈ (4 π α^2 (m_e c^2)^2 )/(E^3 ε )

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to find the cross-section expression.

Another approach: The cross-section for pair production by a gamma photon with a photon of energy ε is given by:

σ = (4 π α^2 m_e^2 c^4) / (E^2 ε) * [ (E ε)/(m_e^2 c^4) ) ]^2 / (something? )

Wait, perhaps I should recall that the cross-section for γγ → e+ e- is given by:

σ = (8 π α^2 m_e^4 c^6) / (E^4 ε^2) ) [ 1/( (E ε/(m_e^2 c^4 ))^2 + ... ) ]

But perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me instead refer to a known relation.

I remember that the cross-section for pair production via CMB photons for a gamma-ray of energy E is approximately:

σ ≈ (4 π α^2 m_e^4 c^6) / (E^2 ε^2 (E + ε) )

But maybe that's not the correct formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the cross-section is given by:

σ ≈ ( (4 π α^2 )/( 3 s ) ) * ( (s)/(4 m_e^2 c^4 ) )^2,

where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy, which is s = 4 E ε.

So s = 4 E ε.

Then,

σ = (4 π α^2 )/(3 * 4 E ε) ) * ( (4 E ε)/(4 m_e^2 c^4) )^2.

Simplify that:

= (4 π α^2 )/(12 E ε) ) * ( ( E ε )/( m_e^2 c^4 ) )^2.

= (π α^2 )/(3 E ε) ) * ( E^2 ε^2 )/( m_e^4 c^8 )

= (π α^2 )/(3 E ε) ) * ( E^2 ε^2 )/( m_e^4 c^8 )

= ( π α^2 E ε )/( 3 m_e^4 c^8 ) ).

Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in the algebra. Let me recheck.

Expanding the terms:

σ = (4 π α^2 / (3 * s)) * (s/(4 m_e^2 c^4))^2.

s is 4 E ε, so:

σ = (4 π α^2 / (3 * 4 E ε)) ) * ( (4 E ε)/(4 m_e^2 c^4) )^2.

Simplify denominator: 3*4 E ε = 12 E ε.

Inside the second term: (4 E ε / 4 m_e^2 c^4 ) = (E ε)/(m_e^2 c^4).

So the second term squared is (E^2 ε^2 )/(m_e^4 c^8 ).

Putting it all together:

σ = (4 π α^2 )/(12 E ε) ) * ( E^2 ε^2 )/( m_e^4 c^8 )

= (4 π α^2 E ε )/(12 m_e^4 c^8 )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

4 / 12 = 1/3, so:

σ = ( π α^2 E ε )/( 3 m_e^4 c^8 )

Wait, that's the cross-section. But this seems odd because when E is large, the cross-section increases with E, which seems counterintuitive because higher energy gammas should have lower cross-sections (like Rutherford scattering). Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, maybe the cross-section actually decreases with E, which would make sense because higher-energy gammas are less likely to interact. So perhaps I must have messed up the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the cross-section formula is σ ≈ (4 π α^2)/(s) * (s/(4 m_e^2 c^4 ))^2. Let me re-calculate that.

σ = [4 π α² / (4 E ε)] * [ (4 E ε)/(4 m_e^2 c^4 ) ]².

= [ π α² / (E ε) ] * [ (E ε) / (m_e^2 c^4 ) ]².

= π α² (E ε ) [ (E ε )^2 / (m_e^4 c^8 ) ) ] / ( E ε )

= π α² (E ε ) * (E² ε² )/( m_e^4 c^8 ) ) / (E ε )

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me compute it step by step.

After substitution, the formula is:

σ = [4 π α²/(4 E ε)] * [ (4 E ε )/(4 m_e^2 c^4 ) ]^2.

First term: [4 π α² / (4 E ε)] = (π α²) / (E ε).

Second term: [ (4 E ε )/(4 m_e^2 c^4 ) ]² = [ (E ε) / (m_e^2 c^4 ) ]² = (E² ε²) / (m_e^4 c^8 ).

So multiply them together:

σ = [ (π α²)/(E ε) ) ] * [ (E² ε²)/( m_e^4 c^8 ) ) ]

= π α² * E² ε² / ( E ε m_e^4 c^8 )

= π α² E ε / ( m_e^4 c^8 )

So the cross-section σ is proportional to E ε.

Wait, that's interesting. So as E increases, σ increases linearly. But that seems to contradict what I thought earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the cross-section is non-zero only when E ε ≥ (m_e c^2 )^2, which is our threshold condition. So the cross-section is σ = (4 π α²)/(3 s) ) * ( s/(4 m_e^2 c^4 ) )^2.

At s =4 E ε, and when E ε is much larger than m_e² c^4, the cross-section would scale as σ ≈ (4 π α² )/(s ) * (s^2 )/( (4 m_e^2 c^4 )^2 )

= (4 π α² s )/( (4 m_e^2 c^4 )^2 )

= (4 π α² )/( 16 m_e^4 c^8 ) ) * s

= ( π α² )/(4 m_e^4 c^8 ) ) * s.

But s =4 E ε, so:

σ ≈ ( π α² *4 E ε )/(4 m_e^4 c^8 )

= ( π α² E ε ) / ( m_e^4 c^8 )

Which is the same as before: σ proportional to E ε.

This seems to suggest that the cross-section increases with E, which would imply that higher-energy gammas interact more, which is counterintuitive. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I should instead think about the cross-section scaling. I think for γγ → e+e-, the cross-section at high energies (E >> m_e c^2) scales as σ ~ (m_e c^2 )^4/(E^2 ε). So that as E increases, σ decreases as 1/E^2.

Wait, that makes more sense. So perhaps I should use σ ≈ ( (4 π α^2 )/(3) ) * ( (m_e c^2 )^4 )/( E^2 ε ) ). Let me check that.

Wait, another source I've read in the past suggests that the cross-section for pair production by a photon with a background photon is given by:

σ ≈ ( (4 π α^2 )/( 3 E^2 ) ) * (m_e c^2 )^4/( (E ε)^2 )

Wait, that would make sigma proportional to (m_e c^2 )^4/(E^4 ε^2 ), which decreases with E^4. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should refer to the classic paper by Primakoff and others, but I don't have that on hand.

Alternatively, perhaps the cross-section is inversely proportional to E^2. So, σ ∝ (m_e c^2 )^4/(E^2 ε^2 ). So let's proceed with this assumption.

So σ ≈ (k (m_e c^2 )^4 )/( E^2 ε^2 ), where k is a dimensionless constant.

Then, the interaction rate Γ = σ n c.

Set Γ = 1/(t_universe), so:

σ n c = 1/t_universe.

Substituting σ:

( k (m_e c^2 )^4 n c ) / ( E^2 ε^2 ) ) = 1/t_universe.

Solve for E:

E^2 = k (m_e c^2 )^4 n c t_universe / ( ε^2 ).

Taking square roots,

E = sqrt( k (m_e c^2 )^4 n c t_universe ) / ε.

Now, plug in the numbers.

But what is the value of k? I think k is a constant that comes from the cross-section formula, perhaps something like 4 π α^2/3. Let me assume k = 4 π α^2/3.

So,

E = sqrt( (4 π α^2/3) * (m_e c^2 )^4 * n * c * t_universe ) / ε.

Now, let's compute each term.

Compute each constant:

α ≈ 1/137 ≈ 0.007297.

m_e c^2 = 0.511e6 eV.

n = 4.11e8 photons/m³.

c = 3e8 m/s.

t_universe ≈ 4.3e17 seconds.

ε = 1e-3 eV.

Compute each part step by step.

First, compute (m_e c^2)^4:

(0.511e6 eV)^4 = (5.11e5 eV)^4.

= (5.11)^4 * (1e5)^4 eV^4.

5.11^4 ≈ 5.11 *5.11=26.11; 26.11 *5.11≈133.3; 133.3*5.11≈680. So approx 680.

(1e5)^4 = 1e20.

So (m_e c^2)^4 ≈ 680e20 eV^4 = 6.8e22 eV^4.

Now, compute the numerator under the square root:

(4 π α^2 /3) * (m_e c^2 )^4 * n * c * t_universe.

Let's compute each term:

4 π ≈ 12.566.

α^2 ≈ (0.007297)^2 ≈ 5.32e-5.

(m_e c^2 )^4 = 6.8e22 eV^4.

n =4.11e8 photons/m³.

c=3e8 m/s.

t_universe=4.3e17 s.

So,

(4 π α^2 /3 ) ≈ (12.566 * 5.32e-5 ) /3 ≈ (6.67e-4 ) /3 ≈ 2.22e-4.

So,

(4 π α^2 /3 ) ≈ 2.22e-4.

Now, multiply all terms:

2.22e-4 * 6.8e22 eV^4 * 4.11e8 photons/m³ *3e8 m/s *4.3e17 s.

Wait, but photons/m³ is a number density, so it's unitless in terms of counts per volume. Let's proceed with the calculation:

Compute the numerical part:

2.22e-4 * 6.8e22 = 2.22e-4 *6.8e22 = (2.22 *6.8) * 1e18 ≈ 15.096e18 ≈ 1.5096e19.

Multiply by 4.11e8: 1.5096e19 *4.11e8 = 6.207e27.

Multiply by 3e8: 6.207e27 *3e8 = 1.862e36.

Multiply by4.3e17: 1.862e36 *4.3e17 ≈ 8.00e53.

So the numerator under the square root is 8e53 eV^4 * m/s * s * photons/m³?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing units here. Let me see:

Each term:

(m_e c^2 )^4 is (eV)^4.

n is photons/m³ → unitless? Or is it in m^-3.

c is m/s.

t is s.

So,

(m_e c^2 )^4 → eV^4.

n → m^-3.

c → m/s.

t → s.

So the entire unit is eV^4 * m^-3 * (m/s) * s → eV^4 * m^-3 * m → eV^4 * m^-2.

So the entire numerator has units of eV^4 m^-2.

But when we take the square root, it would be sqrt( eV^4 m^-2 ) ) = eV^2 m^-1.

Wait, but we're dividing by ε, which is in eV.

So the entire expression E has units of (eV^2 m^-1 ) / eV ) = eV m^-1.

But energy has units of eV, so perhaps I'm missing something here. Maybe I should proceed numerically.

But perhaps the calculation is getting too messy. Let me proceed with the numerical value.

We have the numerator under the square root as 8e53 eV^4 * m^-2.

Wait, no, wait: let's recompute the units.

Wait, the numerator is (4 π α^2/3) * (m_e c^2)^4 * n * c * t.

Which is:

( (dimensionless) ) * (eV^4) * (m^-3) ) * ( m/s ) * ( s )

= eV^4 m^-3 * m/s * s.

The m/s and s cancel, leaving m^-2.

So the numerator is 8e53 eV^4 m^-2.

Taking the square root gives sqrt(8e53 eV^4 m^-2) ) = sqrt(8e53) * eV^2 m^-1.

sqrt(8e53) = sqrt(8)*1e26.5 ≈ 2.828 * 3.16e26 ≈ 8.94e26.

So sqrt(8e53) ≈ 8.94e26.

So the numerator under the square root is 8.94e26 eV² m⁻¹.

Now, E is this value divided by ε, which is 1e-3 eV.

E ≈ (8.94e26 eV² m⁻¹) / (1e-3 eV) ) = 8.94e29 eV m⁻¹.

But eV/m is equivalent to (eV s)/(m c), since c = m/s. Hmm, but perhaps this is getting too confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try to compute the logarithm.

Wait, perhaps I should use natural units where c=1 and ħ=1, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should just compute E in eV.

Wait, the units are a bit messy, but perhaps I can proceed numerically.

So, the numerator under the square root is 8e53 eV^4 m^-2.

Taking the square root gives:

sqrt(8e53) ≈ 8.94e26.

So the numerator is 8.94e26 eV² m⁻¹.

Now, divide by ε = 1e-3 eV.

E = 8.94e26 eV² m⁻¹ / (1e-3 eV ) = 8.94e29 eV m⁻¹.

But eV m⁻¹ is equivalent to (eV s) / (m c ), because c = m/s → s = m/(c).

Wait, perhaps I should convert eV m⁻¹ to GeV.

Wait, 1 eV m⁻¹ = 1e-9 GeV m⁻¹.

Hmm, but perhaps it's easier to compute the numerical value in eV.

Wait, 8.94e29 eV m⁻¹ is actually 8.94e29 eV per meter.

But that's not a standard unit. I think I must have made a mistake in the dimensional analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute E in eV by considering the units correctly.

Wait, let me think about units again.

The expression:

E = sqrt( (4 π α^2/3) * (m_e c^2 )^4 * n * c * t_universe ) / ε.

So,

(4 π α^2/3) is dimensionless.

(m_e c^2 )^4 is (eV)^4.

n is per m³, so m^-3.

c is m/s.

t is seconds.

So,

(m_e c^2 )^4 * n * c * t → eV^4 * m^-3 * m/s * s → eV^4 * m^-2.

So the entire numerator inside the sqrt has units eV^4 m^-2.

Taking the square root gives eV^2 m^-1.

Divided by ε (eV) → eV^2 m^-1 / eV = eV m^-1.

Wait, but what's eV m^-1 in terms of energy? Because E has units of eV.

Hmm, perhaps there's a missing factor of c here. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps I should have included more accurate unit analysis. Let me try again.

The cross-section σ has units of cm².

Wait, but in our calculation, we have n in m^-3, which is 1e6 cm^-3.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute using cm instead of m to avoid confusion.

Let me try again with n in cm^-3.

n = 411 photons/cm³ =411e6 photons/m³ = 411e6 / (1e6 cm³/m³) )= 411 photons/cm³.

Wait, no, 1 m³ = (100 cm)^3 = 1e6 cm³. So 411 photons/cm³ is 411e6 photons/m³.

Ok, but perhaps it's better to work in cgs units.

But maybe it's getting too complicated, and I'm running out of time. Let's proceed numerically.

Wait, plugging in the numbers into the equation:

E ≈ sqrt( k * (m_e c^2)^4 * n * c * t_universe ) / ε.

Assuming k is about (4 pi alpha^2/3) ≈ 2.22e-4 as before.

With the numbers plugged in:

E ≈ sqrt( 2.22e-4 * (0.511e6 eV)^4 * 4.11e8 photons/m³ * 3e8 m/s *4.3e17 s ) / (1e-3 eV).

But let me compute the exponent:

(m_e c^2)^4 = (0.511e6)^4 = (5.11e5)^4 = (5.11)^4 * (1e5)^4 = 680 * 1e20 = 6.8e22.

n =4.11e8 photons/m³.

c=3e8 m/s.

t=4.3e17 s.

Epsilon=1e-3 eV.

Putting it all together:

Inside the sqrt:

2.22e-4 * 6.8e22 * 4.11e8 *3e8 *4.3e17.

Compute each step:

Multiply 2.22e-4 *6.8e22 = 2.22e-4 *6.8e22 = (2.22 *6.8) * 1e18 ≈ 15.096e18.

Multiply by 4.11e8: 15.096e18 *4.11e8 = 6.20e27.

Multiply by 3e8: 6.20e27 *3e8 = 1.86e36.

Multiply by4.3e17: 1.86e36 *4.3e17 = 8.0e53.

So inside the sqrt is 8e53.

So sqrt(8e53) = (8e53)^(1/2) = sqrt(8) * 1e26.5 = 2.828 * 3.16e26 ≈ 8.94e26.

So E = 8.94e26 / (1e-3) = 8.94e29 eV.

Wait, 8.94e29 eV is 8.94e29 eV, but 1e9 eV is 1 GeV. So 8.94e29 eV is 8.94e20 GeV.

But this is way higher than the options given, which are on the order of 1e5 GeV.

Hmm, so I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units for the number density n. Let me check that again.

Wait, the CMB photon number density is about 411 photons/cm³, which is 411e6 photons/m³ (since 1 cm³ = 1e-6 m³, so 411 * 1e6 =411e6 photons/m³).

So n=4.11e8 photons/m³ is correct.

But wait, wait another moment. The number density n is 411 photons/cm³. There are 1e6 cm³ in a m³, so n =411 * 1e6 =4.11e8 photons/m³.

Yes, correct.

Hmm, perhaps the cross-section formula is different. Maybe I should use the formula where the cross-section is proportional to 1/E^2, not E.

Let me think again. If σ is proportional to (m_e c^2)^4/(E^2 ε^2 ), then the expression for E would be.

E^2 = k (m_e c^2)^4 n c t_universe / ( ε^2 ) .

So E = sqrt( k (m_e c^2)^4 n c t ) / ε.

Wait, but if I proceed with the same numbers except that in the cross-section the E is in the denominator squared, then the numerator would be (m_e c^2)^4, and the denominator E^2.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a known formula or approach.

Another approach: Use the formula for the interaction length.

L = 1/(n σ).

The lifetime is limited when the interaction length L is comparable to the size of the universe. The size of the universe is roughly c * t_universe.

So, L ≈ c t_universe → 1/(n σ) ≈ c t_universe → σ ≈ 1/(n c t_universe).

So σ ≈ 1/(n c t_universe ).

Now, if σ is given by (something) * (m_e c^2 )^4/( E^2 ε^2 ), then:

( something ) * (m_e c^2 )^4/( E^2 ε^2 ) ≈ 1/(n c t_universe )

Solving for E:

E^2 ≈ (something) (m_e c^2 )^4 n c t_universe / ε^2.

So,

E ≈ sqrt( [something] (m_e c^2 )^4 n c t_universe ) / ε.

Let me compute this again with [something] being a constant.

But I'm back to the same calculation as before, which gave E ≈ 8.94e29 eV, which is 8.94e20 GeV. But this is not matching any of the options given.

Wait, the options are all around 1e5 GeV, so either I'm missing a factor or made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the assumption that the cross-section scales as (m_e c^2 )^4/(E^2 ε^2 ) is incorrect, and the correct scaling is different.

Another thought: perhaps the cross-section scales as 1/(E ε ), since the cross-section for pair production tends to decrease with higher energies.

Wait, another approach: the cross-section σ for γγ → e+ e- is given by:

σ = (4 π α^2)/(s) * (s/(4 m_e^2 c^4 ))^2,

where s=4 E ε.

So,

σ = (4 π α^2 )/(4 E ε ) ) * ( (4 E ε)/(4 m_e^2 c^4 ) )^2.

Simplify:

= (π α^2 )/(E ε ) ) * ( (E ε )/( m_e^2 c^4 ) )^2.

= (π α^2 E ε )/( m_e^4 c^8 ) * (E^2 ε^2 )/( m_e^4 c^8 ) → no, that's incorrect.

Wait, let me recompute.

( (4 E ε )/(4 m_e^2 c^4 ) )^2 = ( E ε / (m_e^2 c^4 ) )^2 = (E^2 ε^2 )/( m_e^4 c^8 ).

So,

σ = [ (4 π α^2 )/(4 E ε) ) ] * [ (E^2 ε^2 )/( m_e^4 c^8 ) ) ]

= ( π α^2 )/( E ε ) ) * ( E^2 ε^2 )/( m_e^4 c^8 )

= ( π α^2 E ε )/( m_e^4 c^8 )

So σ is proportional to E ε.

But that's strange because as E increases, σ increases, which seems wrong.

Wait, but perhaps this is only valid when E ε is much larger than m_e^4 c^8. But if E increases, and ε is fixed, then σ increases, which would imply that higher-energy gammas are more likely to interact, which is the opposite of what I expected.

This suggests that at higher energies, the cross-section increases, which would mean that high-energy gammas interact more, leading to shorter lifetimes. But this would imply that high-energy gammas have their lifetimes limited, which aligns with the question.

But according to our earlier calculation, the energy E we found was way too high, so perhaps I should see which option is closest.

Our calculation gave E ≈ 8.94e20 GeV, which is way beyond the options provided (all are ~1e5 GeV). So I must have made a mistake in the cross-section formula.

Wait, perhaps I should try using the formula where σ is inversely proportional to E.

Let me try instead assuming that σ ∝ 1/E.

In that case, the expression would be:

E^2 = k (m_e c^2 )^4 n c t_universe ε^2 / ε^2 → E^2 = k (m_e c^2 )^4 n c t_universe.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps the correct cross-section is sigma = [ (4 π α^2 )/( 3 s ) ] * [ s/(4 m_e^2 c^4 ) ]^2.

Substituting s=4 E ε,

sigma = [ (4 π α^2 )/( 12 E ε ) ] * [ (4 E ε )/(4 m_e^2 c^4 ) ]^2.

Simplify:

= [ ( π α^2 )/( 3 E ε ) ] * [ ( E ε )/( m_e^2 c^4 ) ]^2.

= [ π α^2 E ε )/( 3 m_e^4 c^8 ) ].

Which brings me back to sigma being proportional to E ε.

Hmm. With this, the calculation again gives E ~ 1e20 GeV, which is way too high.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the gamma's lifetime is limited when the interaction probability per unit length is ~1, i.e., the optical depth tau ~1. So tau = n sigma L ~1, where L is the path length.

But L is the size of the universe, which is c t_universe.

So tau = n sigma c t_universe.

Set tau =1,

n sigma c t_universe =1,

sigma =1/(n c t_universe).

If sigma is given by sigma = [ (4 π alpha^2 )/(3 s ) ] * (s/(4 m_e^2 c^4 ))^2,

then,

sigma = [ (4 π alpha^2 )/(3 *4 E ε ) ] * [ (4 E ε )/(4 m_e^2 c^4 ) ]^2.

= [ π alpha^2/(3 E ε ) ] * [ ( E ε )^2/( m_e^4 c^8 ) ].

= [ π alpha^2 E ε ]/( 3 m_e^4 c^8 ).

Set equal to 1/(n c t_universe ):

[ π alpha^2 E ε ]/( 3 m_e^4 c^8 ) = 1/(n c t_universe )

Solve for E:

E = [ 3 m_e^4 c^8 )/( π alpha^2 ε n c t_universe ) ].

Simplify,

E = [ 3 m_e^4 c^7 )/( π alpha^2 ε n t_universe ) ].

Now, plug in the numbers.

Compute each part:

m_e c^2 = 0.511e6 eV → m_e = 0.511e6 eV / (c^2). But since we're working in units where c=1 for energy calculations, m_e =0.511e6 eV.

But perhaps it's better to compute m_e in eV s²/m² (since energy E = mc^2 → m = E/(c^2)).

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute everything in terms of eV and seconds.

But this could take a long time. Let me try to compute each term.

m_e^4: (0.511e6 eV )^4 = (5.11e5 eV)^4 = (5.11)^4 * (1e5)^4 eV^4.

As before, 5.11^4 ≈680, (1e5)^4=1e20 → m_e^4 ≈6.8e22 eV^4.

c^7: (3e8 m/s )^7 → but perhaps in eV terms, c^2 is (3e8 m/s )^2 ≈9e16 m²/s².

But perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me proceed numerically.

Compute each term:

3 =3.

m_e^4 =6.8e22 eV^4.

c^7 = (3e8 m/s )^7 = 3^7 *1e56 m^7/s^7 = 2187e56 = 2.187e59 m^7/s^7.

pi ≈3.1416.

alpha^2 ≈ (1/137)^2≈5.3e-5.

epsilon=1e-3 eV.

n=4.11e8 photons/m³.

t_universe=4.3e17 s.

Now,

E = [3 * m_e^4 * c^7 ] / [ pi alpha^2 epsilon n t_universe ]

= [3 *6.8e22 eV^4 *2.187e59 m^7/s^7 ] / [3.1416 *5.3e-5 *1e-3 eV *4.11e8 photons/m^3 *4.3e17 s ]

Compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator:

3 *6.8e22 =2.04e23.

2.04e23 *2.187e59 = 4.45e82.

Units: eV^4 m^7/s^7.

Denominator:

3.1416 *5.3e-5 =1.67e-4.

1.67e-4 *1e-3=1.67e-7.

1.67e-7 *4.11e8= 6.89e1.

6.89e1 *4.3e17= 2.95e19.

Units: (m^-3 s ) because:

epsilon (eV) * n (m^-3) * t (s) → eV m^-3 s.

Wait, but the denominator in E is:

[pi alpha^2 epsilon n t_universe ] → (eV^0) because:

alpha is dimensionless,

epsilon is eV,

n is m^-3,

t is s.

So,

denominator has units of eV * m^-3 * s.

So overall, denominator is 2.95e19 eV m^-3 s.

Now, E = numerator/denominator = (4.45e82 eV^4 m^7/s^7 ) ) / (2.95e19 eV m^-3 s ).

Simplify units:

eV^4 / eV = eV^3.

m^7 / m^-3 = m^10.

s^-7 / s = s^-8.

So,

E = (4.45e82 / 2.95e19 ) * eV^3 m^10 s^-8.

Compute 4.45e82 / 2.95e19 ≈ 1.508e63.

So,

E ≈1.508e63 eV^3 m^10 s^-8.

But this doesn't make sense because E has units of energy, which should be eV. So I must have made a mistake in the unit analysis.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently, considering that the cross-section approach is getting too complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way using the condition that the product of the gamma energy and the CMB photon energy must be above a certain threshold.

Earlier, we found that the threshold condition is E * ε >= (m_e c^2 )^2.

Which gives E >= (m_e c^2 )^2 / ε.

Plugging in the numbers:

(0.511e6 eV )^2 / (1e-3 eV ) = (0.511e6 )^2 /1e-3 = 0.511^2 *1e12 /1e-3 = 0.261 *1e15 = 2.61e14 eV.

Which is 2.61e14 eV = 2.61e5 GeV.

Which corresponds to option C) 2.6e5 GeV.

So the correct answer should be option C.


The problem involves determining the energy of high-energy gamma-rays whose lifetimes in the universe are limited by their annihilation with CMB photons, following the process $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$. The key is to analyze the interaction rate and the threshold energy for this process.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Threshold Condition**:  
   For the annihilation process to occur, the center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}$ must satisfy $\sqrt{s} \geq 2m_e c^2$, where $m_e$ is the electron mass. The center-of-mass energy is given by $s = 4E_\gamma \epsilon$, where $E_\gamma$ is the gamma-ray energy and $\epsilon$ is the CMB photon energy. Substituting $\sqrt{s} \geq 2m_e c^2$, the threshold condition becomes:  
   \[
   E_\gamma \epsilon \geq (m_e c^2)^2
   \]

2. **Solving for $E_\gamma$**:  
   Rearranging the threshold condition to solve for $E_\gamma$:  
   \[
   E_\gamma \geq \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{\epsilon}
   \]  
   Substituting $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 0.511 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV}$ and $\epsilon = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$:  
   \[
   E_\gamma \geq \frac{(0.511 \times 10^6)^2}{10^{-3}} = \frac{0.261 \times 10^{12}}{10^{-3}} = 0.261 \times 10^{15} \, \text{eV}
   \]  
   Converting to GeV ($1 \, \text{GeV} = 10^9 \, \text{eV}$):  
   \[
   E_\gamma \geq 0.261 \times 10^6 \, \text{GeV} = 2.61 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}
   \]

3. **Matching the Options**:  
   The calculated threshold energy $E_\gamma \approx 2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$ corresponds to **Option C**. This represents the energy at which the lifetime of gamma-rays is limited by their interaction with CMB photons.

### Conclusion:
The energy of gamma-rays whose lifetimes are limited by the annihilation process $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$ is approximately $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$. This matches **Option C**.

**Answer: C**
