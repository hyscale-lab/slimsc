Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, particles are being collided at the center of a spherical detector. The new particles produced are fast-decaying and travel at ultra-relativistic velocities, with a Lorentz factor around 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls.

Wait, let me break this down. So, the setup is that particles are produced at the center and move towards the walls. The detector is a sphere with radius 30 meters. The problem is related to the Lorentz factor and how that affects the number of particles that reach the detector.

I remember that the Lorentz factor, gamma, is given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). At ultra-relativistic speeds, v is very close to c, so gamma is large. The particles are moving at a gamma of 20 in the first scenario. 

In the first case, one third (1/3) reach the walls. So, in the initial scenario, only 1/3 make it. But we need to find the gamma where two-thirds (2/3) reach. So, what's changing? I think it's the lifetime of the particles. Because if they decay, those that decay before reaching the detector won't make it. So, the gamma must affect their lifetime, allowing more particles to make the trip before decaying.

Wait, I remember that in particle physics, the proper lifetime (tau) is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. The observed lifetime (t) is gamma times tau. So, longer gamma means the particle lives longer from our frame of reference.

But wait, in this case, I think the problem is about the particles' decay and whether they reach the detector before decaying. So, if the lifetime is longer, the particles can travel a longer distance before decaying. So, a higher gamma would mean more particles reach the detector.

Wait, but in the first scenario, with gamma=20, only 1/3 reach the walls. Now, we need 2/3 to reach. That suggests that the new gamma is higher, so that more of them make it. Because as gamma increases, their lifetime increases, so more reach the detector.

So, the key is probably the relation between the number of particles that reach the detector and gamma. How does that work?

I think the number of particles that reach the detector (N) is related to the decay length. The decay length is the average distance a particle travels before decaying. If the decay length is longer than the detector's radius, more particles will reach the walls.

Wait, the decay length L is gamma * c * tau. If this L is greater than the detector's radius R, then more particles will reach the wall.

But in the first scenario, when gamma is 20, N is 1/3. So, perhaps only a fraction f of the particles have a decay length longer than R. So, f = N, the fraction that reaches. So, in the first case, f = 1/3.

We need f = 2/3 in the second case. So, how does f depend on gamma?

Because the decay length for each particle is gamma * c tau. The number that reach is the fraction where gamma * c tau >= R. But wait, that's if each particle has the same proper lifetime. So, for each particle, if their gamma is such that their decay length is >= R, they reach the detector. But wait, in reality, each particle might have a slightly different gamma, but let's assume they all have the same gamma.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.

The problem says that when gamma is 20, 1/3 reach. So, when gamma is higher, more reach. So, the number that reach is a function of gamma. Let me model this.

Suppose the decay length is L = gamma * c * tau. The radius R is 30 m. So, the condition for a particle to reach the detector is L >= R. So, the fraction that reach is the probability that L >= R.

Assuming that the decay follows an exponential distribution, the number of particles that decay after traveling a distance x is given by the exponential probability. So, the probability that a particle's decay length is greater than R is exp(-R/(c tau gamma)).

Wait, no, the decay probability as a function of distance. The average lifetime is gamma tau, so the decay probability is given by P(x) = 1 - exp(-x/(gamma c tau)). So, the fraction that reaches the detector is the integral from 0 to R, but wait, no. Because the detector is at R=30 m. The probability that a particle doesn't decay before reaching R is P = exp(-R/(gamma c tau)).

Wait, the formula for the number of particles that reach the detector is the probability that the decay occurs after traveling the distance R. So, the survival probability is exp(- R/(gamma c tau)).

So, when gamma is 20, this probability is 1/3. So, 1/3 = exp( - 30/(20 c tau) ). Let's compute that.

Wait, but I don't know c tau. Hmm, but perhaps we can find the ratio of gammas.

Wait, in the first case, when gamma is 20, the survival probability is 1/3. So, 1/3 = exp( - R/(gamma1 c tau) ). Let's call R/(c tau) as a constant, say K.

Wait, no, because R is given as 30 m. So, for gamma1=20, the equation is 1/3 = exp( -30/(gamma1 c tau) ).

Let me compute for gamma1=20:

1/3 = exp(-30/(20 c tau)).

Take natural logs on both sides:

ln(1/3) = -30/(20 c tau) → - ln(3) = -30/(20 c tau) → ln(3) = 30/(20 c tau) → c tau = 30/(20 ln3) → c tau = (3)/(2 ln3).

Wait, but I don't know the value of c tau, but perhaps it's not necessary. Let me think about the second case. We need the survival probability to be 2/3.

So, for gamma2, 2/3 = exp( -30/(gamma2 c tau) ). Take ln on both sides:

ln(2/3) = -30/(gamma2 c tau).

But from the first case, I have ln(3) = 30/(20 c tau).

So, 30/(c tau) = 20 ln3 → c tau = 30/(20 ln3) = (3)/(2 ln3).

Wait, substituting back into the second equation:

ln(2/3) = -30/(gamma2 c tau) → ln(2/3) = -30/(gamma2 * (30/(20 ln3))) )

Wait, let me compute this step by step.

We have 30/(gamma2 c tau) = - ln(2/3).

From the first case, 30/(c tau) = 20 ln3.

So, 30/(gamma2 c tau) = (30/(c tau)) * (1/gamma2) ) = (20 ln3) * (1/gamma2).

So, substituting into the second equation:

20 ln3 * (1/gamma2) = - ln(2/3).

But ln(2/3) is negative. So, 20 ln3 / gamma2 = ln(3/2).

Because ln(2/3) = - ln(3/2). So, 20 ln3 / gamma2 = ln(3/2).

Then, gamma2 = (20 ln3) / ln(3/2).

Let me compute this.

First, compute ln3 ≈ 1.0986.

ln(3/2) is ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055.

So,

gamma2 ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055 ≈ (21.972) / 0.4055 ≈ Let me compute that.

21.972 divided by 0.4055. Let me see:

0.4055 * 54 = 21.9 (approximately) because 0.4 *54=21.6, 0.0055*54=0.297 → total ≈21.897.

So, 21.972 / 0.4055 ≈ 54.

Wait, but 0.4055 * 54 = around 21.897, which is just a bit less than 21.972. So, 54 would give us approximately 21.972.

So, gamma2 ≈ 54.

Looking at the options, option A is 54.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculations.

Compute 20 * ln(3) = 20 * 1.098612 ≈ 21.97224.

Divide by ln(3/2) ≈ 0.405465.

So, 21.97224 / 0.405465 ≈ let's compute that.

21.97224 ÷ 0.405465.

Hmm, 0.405465 * 54 = 0.405465 *50=20.27325, 0.405465*4≈1.62186 → total 21.895.

Which is close to 21.97224. The difference is about 0.077.

So, 54 gives us 21.895, which is about 0.077 less than 21.97224.

So, to find the exact gamma2, perhaps it's a little over 54.

But the options given are A)54, B)68, C)40, D)28.

54 is one of the options, so likely the correct answer is A)54.

To determine the Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector walls, we analyze the relationship between the Lorentz factor, the decay length, and the survival probability of the particles.

The decay length \( L \) of a particle is given by \( L = \gamma c \tau \), where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( c \) is the speed of light, and \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle. The survival probability \( P \) of a particle reaching the detector walls is \( P = \exp(-R / (\gamma c \tau)) \), where \( R \) is the detector radius.

### Step 1: Analyze the first scenario
In the first scenario, the Lorentz factor is \( \gamma_1 = 20 \), and the survival probability is \( P_1 = \frac{1}{3} \). Substituting into the survival probability formula:
\[
\frac{1}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{R}{\gamma_1 c \tau}\right).
\]
Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:
\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{R}{\gamma_1 c \tau}.
\]
Simplify:
\[
\ln(3) = \frac{R}{\gamma_1 c \tau}.
\]
Rearranging:
\[
\frac{R}{c \tau} = \gamma_1 \ln(3).
\]

### Step 2: Analyze the second scenario
In the second scenario, the survival probability is \( P_2 = \frac{2}{3} \), and we need to find the new Lorentz factor \( \gamma_2 \). Substituting into the survival probability formula:
\[
\frac{2}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{R}{\gamma_2 c \tau}\right).
\]
Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:
\[
\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{R}{\gamma_2 c \tau}.
\]
Simplify:
\[
\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) = \frac{R}{\gamma_2 c \tau}.
\]

### Step 3: Relate the two scenarios
From the first scenario, we know \( \frac{R}{c \tau} = \gamma_1 \ln(3) \). Substituting this into the second scenario:
\[
\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) = \frac{\gamma_1 \ln(3)}{\gamma_2}.
\]
Rearranging for \( \gamma_2 \):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{\gamma_1 \ln(3)}{\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)}.
\]

### Step 4: Compute \( \gamma_2 \)
Using \( \gamma_1 = 20 \), \( \ln(3) \approx 1.0986 \), and \( \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) \approx 0.4055 \):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{20 \cdot 1.0986}{0.4055}.
\]
Simplify:
\[
\gamma_2 \approx \frac{21.972}{0.4055} \approx 54.
\]

### Conclusion
The Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector walls is approximately \( \gamma_2 = 54 \). This corresponds to option **A**.
