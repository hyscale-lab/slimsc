Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I remember that in such a well, the particles can only exist in specific energy levels. The problem states that there are four identical spin-1/2 particles, and I need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited, and second excited states.

Wait, each particle is spin-1/2, so that's like electrons, right? And since they're identical, they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. Oh right, because fermions can't occupy the same quantum state.

The well has length L, and the energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite well are given by E_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²), which simplifies to E times n squared, since E is defined as E = π²ħ²/(2mL²). So each energy level for a single particle is E multiplied by n², where n is the principal quantum number.

But wait, when you have multiple particles, their total energy is the sum of their individual energies. But since they're fermions, they can't all have the same n. So the ground state would have them in the lowest possible orbitals without violating the exclusion principle.

So for four particles, each must occupy a unique quantum state, but since spin is 1/2, each n can have two possible spins. Oh wait, no, because each particle is identical, and the spin is part of their quantum state. So for each n, there are two possible states: spin-up and spin-down. So each n can hold two particles.

So let's think about how the four particles would fill up the energy levels.

In the ground state (lowest energy), they'll fill the lowest possible n's with two particles each. Let's see:

n=1 can hold 2 particles (spin up and down).
n=2 can hold another 2 particles.

So total of four particles. So the ground state would have two particles in n=1 and two in n=2.

Calculating the energy for each: n=1 gives E, n=2 gives 4E. But wait, each particle's energy is E times n². So for each particle in n=1, energy is E, and for n=2, it's 4E.

But wait, no, each particle's energy is E multiplied by n squared. So for the particles in n=1, each contributes E, and for n=2, each contributes 4E. So the total energy for the system in the ground state is (2 * E) + (2 * 4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E. Wait, but wait, no, each particle is independent; but wait, no, the question says "energies of the ground state, first excited state, etc." So the total energy for the system.

Wait no, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think again. The question says, calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system. So for each state, we're probably looking for the total energy. Let me make sure.

So in the ground state, we have four particles. Each n can have two particles. So for n=1, two particles, each with energy E. For n=2, two particles, each with 4E. Total energy is 2E + 2*(4E) = 2E +8E=10E.

Wait but wait, that's not correct because each level can have two particles, but are the particles allowed to be in the same n? Yes, because each has a different spin state. So ground state has n=1 with two particles and n=2 with two particles. So the total energy is 2E + 2*(4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.

Wait, but that's the total energy for the ground state. So looking at the options, let's see which option has 10E as the ground state? Let me look at the options.

Option B is 4E, 10E, 50E. So ground state is 4E. Hmm, that doesn't match what I thought. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the filling. Because for four particles, each with spin 1/2, and in a 1D well. The Pauli exclusion principle says that no two fermions can have the same set of quantum numbers. So each particle must have a unique set of quantum numbers.

In a 1D well, the quantum numbers are n and spin. So for each n, you can have two particles (spin up and down).

So for four particles, the lowest energy configuration would be having n=1 (two particles) and n=2 (two particles). So each of these n's can hold two, so the first two n's sum up to four particles.

So the total energy would be (2 * E) + (2 * 4E) = 2E +8E =10E. So ground state is 10E.

But looking at the options, option C and B have 4E, 10E, etc. So maybe I'm wrong.

Wait, perhaps the particles are spin-1/2 but the well is 1D, so maybe the quantum number is only n, not including spin. Because in 1D, the quantum state is determined by n and spin. So each n can hold two particles.

So for four particles, you have two in n=1 and two in n=2. So total energy is 2E +2*(4E) = 2E+8E=10E. So the ground state energy is 10E.

Wait, but let's look at the options. Option B says ground state is 4E. Hmm, so that's conflicting.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the way the states are filled. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps each particle is a spin-1/2, but perhaps the spin is considered part of the quantum state. So each particle in the same n can have different spin, so each n can hold two particles. So for four particles, they would fill n=1 (two) and n=2 (two), leading to a total energy of 10E.

But looking at the options, which option has 10E for the ground state? Let me check the options again.

Option B: 4E, 10E, 50E. So the ground state is 4E, which doesn't fit my calculation.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Maybe the particles are spin-1/2, but the energy levels are filled in a way that each n can hold two particles, but perhaps the first excited state is when one particle moves to a higher n.

Wait, perhaps the ground state has all four particles in the lowest possible n. But wait, n=1 can hold two particles, so n=2 can hold two more. So that's the ground state.

The first excited state would be when one of the particles moves to a higher n. But that would be the lowest possible higher energy state. So perhaps, the next possible arrangement is when three particles are in n=1 and one in n=2. Wait, but no, because n=1 can only hold two. So the next possible is putting two in n=1 (max), and the other two in n=2. So that's the ground state, and the first excited state would involve moving one particle from n=2 to n=3.

Wait, let me think about the possible states and their energies.

Ground state: two particles in n=1 (each E), two in n=2 (each 4E). Total energy is 2*E + 2*(4E) = 10E.

First excited state: perhaps moving a particle from n=2 to n=3. Then, the configuration would be two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3.

So the energy would be 2E + 1*4E + 1*9E = 2E +4E +9E = 15E.

Wait, but wait, that's the first excited state. Then the second excited state would involve another particle moving to a higher n. But might there be a lower energy arrangement?

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state has a different configuration. Let's see:

In the ground state, the particles are in n=1 (two) and n=2 (two).

The first excited state would be the next lowest energy arrangement. So perhaps, moving one particle from n=2 to n=3, so the configuration is two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3.

The energy would be 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.

The second excited state would have another particle moving to higher n. So maybe two particles in n=3, but wait, no, n=3 can hold two particles, but we've already moved one from n=2 to n=3.

Wait, but for four particles, after moving one from n=2 to n=3, the total would be two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. That's four particles. So the next state could be moving another particle from n=2 to n=3 or n=4.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state could have three particles in n=1 and one in n=2, but no, that's not possible because n=1 can only hold two.

Wait, maybe the first excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3 while another is promoted from n=2 to n=3 as well. No, wait, because n=2 holds two particles, so moving both to n=3 would require two particles there, but n=3 can hold two. So that would require taking two from n=2 and putting them in n=3. But in that case, the configuration would be two in n=1, and two in n=3. The energy would be 2E + 2*(9E) = 2E +18E =20E. But wait, that's higher than the previous scenario.

Hmm, so which is lower energy: 15E or 20E? 15 is lower, so the first excited state would be 15E, and the second excited state would be 20E.

But wait, looking at the options, which one includes 10E, 15E, and a higher number?

Option C: 4E, 10E, 15E. No, because the ground state is 10E, but option C's first option is 4E, which doesn't match.

Option D: 10E, 15E, 18E. Hmm, but I thought the second excited state would be 20E. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something in the way the particles are arranged.

Wait, another approach: the possible energy levels are filled in order of increasing n, each n can hold two particles (because of spin up and down). So the order of filling is n=1 (2 particles), n=2 (2), n=3 (2), etc.

So for four particles, the first two are in n=1, the next two in n=2. That's the ground state, with energy 2E + 2*(4E) = 10E.

The first excited state would involve moving one particle from n=2 to n=3, so we have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. The energy would be 2E +4E +9E =15E.

The second excited state would then involve moving another particle from n=2 to n=3, making it two in n=1, and two in n=3. So the energy would be 2E + 2*(9E) =2E +18E=20E. But looking at the options, none of them have 20E.

Wait, perhaps my calculation is wrong. Let me recalculate.

Wait, E= π²ħ²/(2mL²). So for n=1: E_1 =1E, n=2:4E, n=3:9E, n=4:16E, etc.

So the ground state: two particles in n=1 (each E), two in n=2 (each 4E). So total is 2*E + 2*(4E) = 2E +8E =10E.

First excited state: moving one from n=2 to n=3. So now, two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. Total energy: 2E +4E +9E =15E.

Second excited state: moving another from n=2 to n=3. Now, two in n=1, two in n=3. So total energy: 2E + 2*9E = 2E +18E=20E.

But looking at the options, none of them have 20E. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the filling order.

Wait, maybe the first excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3, and another is promoted to n=3 as well, but that's not possible because n=2 can only have two particles. Wait, no, because in the ground state, n=2 has two, so when you promote one, you have one left in n=2 and one in n=3.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing other possibilities. Another way to reach a higher state is to promote a particle from n=2 to n=4, which is higher but perhaps the next possible state.

Wait, the energy for n=3 is 9E, and n=4 is 16E. So moving a particle from n=2 to n=3 gives 9E, which is lower than 16E. So the first excited state would be when one particle moves to n=3, giving a total energy of 15E.

But looking at the options, option D has 10E (ground state), 15E (first excited), 18E (second excited). So 18E doesn't fit with what I have.

Wait, maybe the second excited state is when two particles are promoted to n=3. So the configuration is two in n=1, two in n=3. So energy is 2E + 2*9E =20E. But none of the options have 20E. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the first excited state is not moving a particle to n=3 but moving both to higher ns, but that seems unlikely.

Another possibility: perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3 and another to n=3 as well. But that would require two particles in n=3, which can hold two. So that would be the second state after the ground state.

Wait, but that would give a total of two in n=1, two in n=3. So the energy would be 2E + 2*9E =2E +18E=20E.

But that's the second excited state.

Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the first excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, making the configuration two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. So energy is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Then the second excited state could be when another particle is promoted to n=3, making two in n=3 and one in n=2. So the total would be 2E +4E +2*(9E) = 2E +4E +18E=24E.

But that doesn't match any of the options either.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A:30E,39E,50E. The ground state is 30E, which is higher than my calculated 10E. Doesn't make sense.

Option B:4E,10E,50E. Ground state is 4E. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in considering the filling. Maybe the particles are arranged in a way that they have higher n in the ground state.

Option C:4E,10E,15E. Again, their ground state is 4E.

Option D:10E,15E,18E. So the ground state is 10E, which matches what I thought.

Wait, but in option D, the second excited state is 18E. How does that happen?

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and one in n=2. So the configuration would be two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. But that's the same as the first excited state which I thought was 15E. Alternatively, maybe it's when two particles move to n=3, making the configuration two in n=1, two in n=3. So the energy is 2E + 2*9E=2E +18E=20E. But the option has 18E as the second excited state.

Hmm, maybe I'm not considering that the particles could fill n=4 in some way. Wait, but n=4 is higher in energy than 3, so that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the first and second excited states involve moving particles into higher n's but in a way that the total energy is lower than I thought. Alternatively, perhaps my initial assumption about the ground state is wrong.

Wait, could the ground state have the particles in n=1, n=1, n=2, n=2. Then the first excited state would have one particle promoted to n=3, making the configuration n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). Total energy 2E +4E +9E =15E. Then the second excited state would be when another particle is promoted to n=3, making two in n=3, so total energy 2E +4E + 18E=24E. But the options don't have 24E.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when a particle moves from n=2 to n=4. That would give the configuration n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=4 (1). The energy would be 2E +4E +16E=22E. Still not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4. So the configuration would be two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3, and one in n=4? No, wait, there are four particles. So maybe two in n=1, one in n=3, and one in n=4. But that's four particles. So the energy would be 2E +9E +16E=27E. Not matching any option.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the possible states in terms of the number of particles in each n.

Ground state: n=1 (2), n=2 (2) → energy 2E + 2*(4E) =10E.

First excited state: one particle promoted to n=3 → n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1) → energy 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Second excited state: another particle promoted to n=3 → n=1 (2), n=3 (2) → energy 2E + 2*9E=2E +18E=20E.

But none of the options include 20E. Hmm.

Looking back at the options, option D has 10E, 15E, 18E. So the third state is 18E, which is less than 20E. So perhaps another scenario.

Wait, maybe the second excited state isn't two particles in n=3 but one in n=3 and one in n=4.

So the configuration would be n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1), n=4 (1). Wait, no, that's four particles. So the energy would be 2E +4E +9E +16E=31E. But that's higher than 18E.

Alternatively, maybe after the first excited state (15E), the next state is when a particle is promoted from n=2 to n=4, making energy 2E +4E +16E =22E. Still not matching.

Wait, what if the first excited state is when two particles are in n=2 and one in n=3? No, because n=2 can only hold two. So that's not possible.

Wait, maybe I'm missing that after filling n=1 and n=2, the next state is when two particles are in n=3, but that would require removing two from n=2 and putting them in n=3. So the configuration would be two in n=1, two in n=3. So the energy would be 2E + 2*9E=20E.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct option is not present. But the options must have an answer.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. It says "energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system".

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the energy levels not as the sum of all particles' energies, but perhaps the individual energies of the particles, but that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps the question is about the energy levels for each particle, but no, the question says the energies of the system.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the particles are spin-1/2, so their spin can be considered part of the quantum numbers. So for each n, two possible spin states (up and down), so each n can hold two particles.

Four particles would fill n=1 (two) and n=2 (two), giving a total energy of 10E.

The first excited state would be when two particles are in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3 → energy 2E +4E +9E=15E.

The second excited state would be when two are in n=1, two in n=3 → 2E + 2*9E=20E.

But again, the options don't have 20E. So perhaps the options are considering another approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the fermions as having to occupy different n's because perhaps the spin is not considered part of the state. Wait, but in a 1D box, the wavefunction is determined by n and spin. So each n can hold two particles (spin up and down). So for four particles, n=1 (2), n=2 (2). So the ground state is 10E.

Looking at the options, option D has ground state 10E, first excited 15E, second 18E.

So where does 18E come from?

Ah, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4. Wait, let me calculate that.

If two in n=1, one in n=3, and one in n=4 → energy 2E +9E +16E=27E. No, that's not 18E.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=2 and two in n=3 → 2*(4E) +2*(9E) =8E +18E=26E. Still not matching.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=4 and another to n=3. So energy would be 2E +4E +9E +16E=31E. No, that's way higher.

Wait, maybe I'm missing that the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and zero in n=2. So two in n=1, two in n=3 → 2E + 18E=20E.

But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when a particle is promoted to n=4, so two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4. That would give 2E +4E +16E=22E.

Still not matching any option. I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about fermions. Wait, no, the question says spin-1/2 particles, which are fermions. So the Pauli exclusion applies.

Wait, maybe the particles are in a symmetric state, but I don't think that's relevant here.

Wait, let's think differently. Maybe the question is not about the sum of energies but about the individual energies. No, that doesn't make sense.

Another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the ground state, first, and second excited states in terms of each particle's energy, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps each particle's energy is considered individually, and the question is about the possible energy levels for the system, but again, that's unclear.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look at the options again.

Option D says the energies are 10E,15E,18E. So perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and one in n=2. Let's see:

n=1: two → 2E,

n=2: one →4E,

n=3: two →2*9E=18E.

Wait, no, that's 2E +4E +18E=24E.

Hmm, but that's not matching.

Alternatively, if two particles are in n=3 and one in n=2 and one in n=1, but that's four particles.

Wait, n=1: two (2E),

n=2: one (4E),

n=3: one (9E).

That's 2E +4E +9E=15E, which is the first excited state.

Wait, but that's the same as before. So the second excited state must be higher than that.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4. So configuration is two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4. So energy is 2E +4E +16E=22E. But 22E isn't in any option, so I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem considers that the ground state is when the particles are in n=1, n=1, n=2, n=2, which is 10E. The first excited state is three in n=1 and one in n=3. Wait, no, because n=1 can only hold two.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me think about what the options are.

Looking at option D: 10E,15E,18E.

So ground state is 10E.

First excited state is15E.

Second excited state is18E.

How can 18E be achieved?

Ah! Wait, 18E could be when two particles are in n=3 (each 9E), so 2*9E=18E, but no, because that's just the energy from those two, but the other two are in n=1 and n=2.

Wait, no, the total would be 2E (n=1) + 4E (n=2) + 2*9E (n=3) → 2E+4E+18E=24E. That's not matching.

Wait another idea: perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=4. That would be 2*9E + 2*16E=18E+32E=50E. But that's way higher than 18E.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the way the states are filled. Maybe the first excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, and another is promoted from n=2 to n=4. So the configuration is two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3, one in n=4. But that's five particles, which is more than four. So that can't be right.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the particles are arranged in a way where the first excited state is when two particles are in n=2 and two in n=3. So the configuration is two in n=2 (each 4E) and two in n=3 (each 9E). So the total energy is 2*(4E) + 2*(9E) =8E +18E=26E. But that's not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and one in n=4, making the configuration two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3, and one in n=4. But that's five particles. So no.

I think I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again. Option D's second excited state is 18E. How can 18E be achieved?

Wait, 18E is 2*9E, which would mean two particles in n=3. So perhaps the configuration is two in n=1, two in n=3 → energy 2E + 2*9E=20E. But that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4. So 2E (n=1) +4E (n=2) +16E (n=4)=22E. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is 15E, and the second is 18E, which would be when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4. But that's 9E +16E=25E, but 2E+4E+25E=31E. No.

Hmm, maybe the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=4. But that's 2*9E + 2*16E=18E+32E=50E. Which is option A's third option.

But I'm not making progress here. Perhaps I should pick the option that matches the ground state I thought, 10E. Looking at the options, only D and B have 10E as the ground state or first state. Option D has 10E as the ground state, so that's likely correct.

So the ground state is 10E (option D's first option). The first excited state is 15E (their second option), which would be moving one particle to n=3. The second excited state in option D is 18E, which I'm not sure how to get. But maybe the second excited state is when two particles are promoted to n=3, but that would require two in n=3, so 2*9E=18E. So the system's energy would be 2E (n=1) +2*9E=2E+18E=20E. But option D's second excited state is 18E. So maybe I'm not adding correctly.

Wait, perhaps the system's energy is only the sum of the energies of the particles in higher n's beyond the ground state. But no, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4. So the configuration is two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4. So the energy would be 2E +4E +16E=22E. But none of the options have that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering spin and each n can only hold one particle. But that can't be right for spin-1/2.

Alternatively, perhaps the particles are bosons, but the question says spin-1/2, which are fermions.

I'm stuck, but based on the options, option D has the ground state at 10E, which I think is correct, and the first excited state at 15E, which makes sense. The second excited state is 18E, which I'm not exactly sure about, but perhaps the calculation is different.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the way the particles are arranged in the excited states depends on the order of possible energy promotions.

Ground state: n=1(2), n=2(2) → 10E.

First excited state: move one from n=2 to n=3 → n=1(2), n=2(1), n=3(1). Energy 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Second excited state: move another from n=2 to n=3 → n=1(2), n=3(2). So energy 2E + 2*9E=2E+18E=20E. But option D shows 18E as the second excited state. So perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3, which is 18E, but the sum would be 2E +18E=20E. But the option shows 18E as the second excited state's energy. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding what the question is asking.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the energy of each particle, but that doesn't make sense because the total energy would still require summing.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the individual energies of each particle and the question is about the possible energy levels for each particle, but no, the question says "energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system".

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the energy levels in a different way. Let me think: the energy levels are filled as n=1 (2 particles), n=2 (2), n=3 (2), etc. So the ground state is 10E, first excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3 (15E), and the second excited state is when another is promoted to n=3 (20E). But the option D has 18E as the second.

Hmm, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=4, giving 16E. So the configuration would be two in n=1 (2E), one in n=2 (4E), and one in n=4 (16E). So the total is 2E +4E +16E=22E. But that's not matching.

I'm really stuck here, but based on the options, and the fact that option D's ground state is 10E, which I'm confident is correct, and the first excited state is 15E, I'll go with option D as the answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the energy levels of four identical spin-1/2 fermions in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The energy levels for a single particle are given by:

\[
E_n = n^2 E, \quad \text{where } E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2}.
\]

Since the particles are fermions, they obey the Pauli exclusion principle, meaning no two particles can occupy the same quantum state. Each energy level \( n \) can hold two particles due to the spin-1/2 nature of the particles (spin-up and spin-down states).

### Ground State
In the ground state, the particles fill the lowest available energy levels. The lowest two levels, \( n=1 \) and \( n=2 \), each hold two particles:
- Two particles in \( n=1 \): Total energy contribution = \( 2 \cdot E = 2E \),
- Two particles in \( n=2 \): Total energy contribution = \( 2 \cdot 4E = 8E \).

Thus, the total energy of the ground state is:
\[
E_{\text{ground}} = 2E + 8E = 10E.
\]

### First Excited State
In the first excited state, one particle is promoted from \( n=2 \) to \( n=3 \). The configuration becomes:
- Two particles in \( n=1 \): Total energy contribution = \( 2E \),
- One particle in \( n=2 \): Total energy contribution = \( 4E \),
- One particle in \( n=3 \): Total energy contribution = \( 9E \).

Thus, the total energy of the first excited state is:
\[
E_{\text{first excited}} = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.
\]

### Second Excited State
In the second excited state, another particle is promoted from \( n=2 \) to \( n=3 \). The configuration becomes:
- Two particles in \( n=1 \): Total energy contribution = \( 2E \),
- Two particles in \( n=3 \): Total energy contribution = \( 2 \cdot 9E = 18E \).

Thus, the total energy of the second excited state is:
\[
E_{\text{second excited}} = 2E + 18E = 20E.
\]

### Matching with Options
From the calculations:
- Ground state energy = \( 10E \),
- First excited state energy = \( 15E \),
- Second excited state energy = \( 20E \).

However, none of the options explicitly include \( 20E \) for the second excited state. Among the given options, **Option D** has the closest match:
- Ground state = \( 10E \),
- First excited state = \( 15E \),
- Second excited state = \( 18E \).

While \( 18E \) does not exactly match the calculated \( 20E \), it is the most reasonable choice based on the provided options.

### Final Answer
The correct option is:

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I remember that in such a well, the particles can only exist in specific energy levels. The problem states that there are four identical spin-1/2 particles, and I need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited, and second excited states.

Wait, each particle is spin-1/2, so that's like electrons, right? And since they're identical, they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. Oh right, because fermions can't occupy the same quantum state.

The well has length L, and the energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite well are given by E_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²), which simplifies to E times n squared, since E is defined as E = π²ħ²/(2mL²). So each energy level for a single particle is E multiplied by n², where n is the principal quantum number.

But wait, when you have multiple particles, their total energy is the sum of their individual energies. But since they're fermions, they can't all have the same n. So the ground state would have them in the lowest possible orbitals without violating the exclusion principle.

So for four particles, each must occupy a unique quantum state, but since spin is 1/2, each n can have two possible spins. Oh wait, no, because each particle is identical, and the spin is part of their quantum state. So for each n, there are two possible states: spin-up and spin-down. So each n can hold two particles.

So let's think about how the four particles would fill up the energy levels.

In the ground state (lowest energy), they'll fill the lowest possible n's with two particles each. Let's see:

n=1 can hold 2 particles (spin up and down).
n=2 can hold another 2 particles.

So total of four particles. So the ground state would have two particles in n=1 and two in n=2.

Calculating the energy for each: n=1 gives E, n=2 gives 4E. But wait, each particle's energy is E times n². So for each particle in n=1, energy is E, and for n=2, it's 4E.

But wait, no, each particle's energy is E multiplied by n squared. So for the particles in n=1, each contributes E, and for n=2, each contributes 4E. So the total energy for the system in the ground state is (2 * E) + (2 * 4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E. Wait, but wait, no, each particle is independent; but wait, no, the question says "energies of the ground state, first excited state, etc." So the total energy for the system.

Wait no, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think again. The question says, calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system. So for each state, we're probably looking for the total energy. Let me make sure.

So in the ground state, we have four particles. Each n can have two particles. So for n=1, two particles, each with energy E. For n=2, two particles, each with 4E. Total energy is 2E + 2*(4E) = 2E +8E=10E.

Wait but wait, that's not correct because each level can have two particles, but are the particles allowed to be in the same n? Yes, because each has a different spin state. So ground state has n=1 with two particles and n=2 with two particles. So the total energy is 2E + 2*(4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.

Wait, but that's the total energy for the ground state. So looking at the options, let's see which option has 10E as the ground state? Let me look at the options.

Option B is 4E, 10E, 50E. So ground state is 4E. Hmm, that doesn't match what I thought. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the filling. Because for four particles, each with spin 1/2, and in a 1D well. The Pauli exclusion principle says that no two fermions can have the same set of quantum numbers. So each particle must have a unique set of quantum numbers.

In a 1D well, the quantum numbers are n and spin. So for each n, you can have two particles (spin up and down).

So for four particles, the lowest energy configuration would be having n=1 (two particles) and n=2 (two particles). So each of these n's can hold two, so the first two n's sum up to four particles.

So the total energy would be (2 * E) + (2 * 4E) = 2E +8E =10E. So ground state is 10E.

But looking at the options, option C and B have 4E, 10E, etc. So maybe I'm wrong.

Wait, perhaps the particles are spin-1/2 but the well is 1D, so maybe the quantum number is only n, not including spin. Because in 1D, the quantum state is determined by n and spin. So each n can hold two particles.

So for four particles, you have two in n=1 and two in n=2. So total energy is 2E +2*(4E) = 2E+8E=10E. So the ground state energy is 10E.

Wait, but let's look at the options. Option B says ground state is 4E. Hmm, so that's conflicting.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the way the states are filled. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps each particle is a spin-1/2, but perhaps the spin is considered part of the quantum state. So each particle in the same n can have different spin, so each n can hold two particles. So for four particles, they would fill n=1 (two) and n=2 (two), leading to a total energy of 10E.

But looking at the options, which option has 10E for the ground state? Let me check the options again.

Option B: 4E, 10E, 50E. So the ground state is 4E, which doesn't fit my calculation.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Maybe the particles are spin-1/2, but the energy levels are filled in a way that each n can hold two particles, but perhaps the first excited state is when one particle moves to a higher n.

Wait, perhaps the ground state has all four particles in the lowest possible n. But wait, n=1 can hold two particles, so n=2 can hold two more. So that's the ground state.

The first excited state would be when one of the particles moves to a higher n. But that would be the lowest possible higher energy state. So perhaps, the next possible arrangement is when three particles are in n=1 and one in n=2. Wait, but no, because n=1 can only hold two. So the next possible is putting two in n=1 (max), and the other two in n=2. So that's the ground state, and the first excited state would involve moving one particle from n=2 to n=3.

Wait, let me think about the possible states and their energies.

Ground state: two particles in n=1 (each E), two in n=2 (each 4E). Total energy is 2*E + 2*(4E) = 10E.

First excited state: perhaps moving a particle from n=2 to n=3. Then, the configuration would be two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3.

So the energy would be 2E + 1*4E + 1*9E = 2E +4E +9E = 15E.

Wait, but wait, that's the first excited state. Then the second excited state would involve another particle moving to a higher n. But might there be a lower energy arrangement?

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state has a different configuration. Let's see:

In the ground state, the particles are in n=1 (two) and n=2 (two).

The first excited state would be the next lowest energy arrangement. So perhaps, moving one particle from n=2 to n=3, so the configuration is two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3.

The energy would be 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.

The second excited state would have another particle moving to higher n. So maybe two particles in n=3, but wait, no, n=3 can hold two particles, but we've already moved one from n=2 to n=3.

Wait, but for four particles, after moving one from n=2 to n=3, the total would be two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. That's four particles. So the next state could be moving another particle from n=2 to n=3 or n=4.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state could have three particles in n=1 and one in n=2, but no, that's not possible because n=1 can only hold two.

Wait, maybe the first excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3 while another is promoted from n=2 to n=3 as well. No, wait, because n=2 holds two particles, so moving both to n=3 would require two particles there, but n=3 can hold two. So that would require taking two from n=2 and putting them in n=3. But in that case, the configuration would be two in n=1, and two in n=3. The energy would be 2E + 2*(9E) = 2E +18E =20E. But wait, that's higher than the previous scenario.

Hmm, so which is lower energy: 15E or 20E? 15 is lower, so the first excited state would be 15E, and the second excited state would be 20E.

But wait, looking at the options, which one includes 10E, 15E, and a higher number?

Option C: 4E, 10E, 15E. No, because the ground state is 10E, but option C's first option is 4E, which doesn't match.

Option D: 10E, 15E, 18E. Hmm, but I thought the second excited state would be 20E. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something in the way the particles are arranged.

Wait, another approach: the possible energy levels are filled in order of increasing n, each n can hold two particles (because of spin up and down). So the order of filling is n=1 (2 particles), n=2 (2), n=3 (2), etc.

So for four particles, the first two are in n=1, the next two in n=2. That's the ground state, with energy 2E + 2*(4E) = 10E.

The first excited state would involve moving one particle from n=2 to n=3, so we have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. The energy would be 2E +4E +9E =15E.

The second excited state would then involve moving another particle from n=2 to n=3, making it two in n=1, and two in n=3. So the energy would be 2E + 2*(9E) =2E +18E=20E. But looking at the options, none of them have 20E.

Wait, perhaps my calculation is wrong. Let me recalculate.

Wait, E= π²ħ²/(2mL²). So for n=1: E_1 =1E, n=2:4E, n=3:9E, n=4:16E, etc.

So the ground state: two particles in n=1 (each E), two in n=2 (each 4E). So total is 2*E + 2*(4E) = 2E +8E =10E.

First excited state: moving one from n=2 to n=3. So now, two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. Total energy: 2E +4E +9E =15E.

Second excited state: moving another from n=2 to n=3. Now, two in n=1, two in n=3. So total energy: 2E + 2*9E = 2E +18E=20E.

But looking at the options, none of them have 20E. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the filling order.

Wait, maybe the first excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3, and another is promoted to n=3 as well, but that's not possible because n=2 can only have two particles. Wait, no, because in the ground state, n=2 has two, so when you promote one, you have one left in n=2 and one in n=3.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing other possibilities. Another way to reach a higher state is to promote a particle from n=2 to n=4, which is higher but perhaps the next possible state.

Wait, the energy for n=3 is 9E, and n=4 is 16E. So moving a particle from n=2 to n=3 gives 9E, which is lower than 16E. So the first excited state would be when one particle moves to n=3, giving a total energy of 15E.

But looking at the options, option D has 10E (ground state), 15E (first excited), 18E (second excited). So 18E doesn't fit with what I have.

Wait, maybe the second excited state is when two particles are promoted to n=3. So the configuration is two in n=1, two in n=3. So energy is 2E + 2*9E =20E. But none of the options have 20E. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the first excited state is not moving a particle to n=3 but moving both to higher ns, but that seems unlikely.

Another possibility: perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3 and another to n=3 as well. But that would require two particles in n=3, which can hold two. So that would be the second state after the ground state.

Wait, but that would give a total of two in n=1, two in n=3. So the energy would be 2E + 2*9E =2E +18E=20E.

But that's the second excited state.

Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the first excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, making the configuration two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. So energy is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Then the second excited state could be when another particle is promoted to n=3, making two in n=3 and one in n=2. So the total would be 2E +4E +2*(9E) = 2E +4E +18E=24E.

But that doesn't match any of the options either.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A:30E,39E,50E. The ground state is 30E, which is higher than my calculated 10E. Doesn't make sense.

Option B:4E,10E,50E. Ground state is 4E. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in considering the filling. Maybe the particles are arranged in a way that they have higher n in the ground state.

Option C:4E,10E,15E. Again, their ground state is 4E.

Option D:10E,15E,18E. So the ground state is 10E, which matches what I thought.

Wait, but in option D, the second excited state is 18E. How does that happen?

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and one in n=2. So the configuration would be two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. But that's the same as the first excited state which I thought was 15E. Alternatively, maybe it's when two particles move to n=3, making the configuration two in n=1, two in n=3. So the energy is 2E + 2*9E=2E +18E=20E. But the option has 18E as the second excited state.

Hmm, maybe I'm not considering that the particles could fill n=4 in some way. Wait, but n=4 is higher in energy than 3, so that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the first and second excited states involve moving particles into higher n's but in a way that the total energy is lower than I thought. Alternatively, perhaps my initial assumption about the ground state is wrong.

Wait, could the ground state have the particles in n=1, n=1, n=2, n=2. Then the first excited state would have one particle promoted to n=3, making the configuration n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). Total energy 2E +4E +9E =15E. Then the second excited state would be when another particle is promoted to n=3, making two in n=3, so total energy 2E +4E + 18E=24E. But the options don't have 24E.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when a particle moves from n=2 to n=4. That would give the configuration n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=4 (1). The energy would be 2E +4E +16E=22E. Still not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4. So the configuration would be two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3, and one in n=4? No, wait, there are four particles. So maybe two in n=1, one in n=3, and one in n=4. But that's four particles. So the energy would be 2E +9E +16E=27E. Not matching any option.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the possible states in terms of the number of particles in each n.

Ground state: n=1 (2), n=2 (2) → energy 2E + 2*(4E) =10E.

First excited state: one particle promoted to n=3 → n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1) → energy 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Second excited state: another particle promoted to n=3 → n=1 (2), n=3 (2) → energy 2E + 2*9E=2E +18E=20E.

But none of the options include 20E. Hmm.

Looking back at the options, option D has 10E, 15E, 18E. So the third state is 18E, which is less than 20E. So perhaps another scenario.

Wait, maybe the second excited state isn't two particles in n=3 but one in n=3 and one in n=4.

So the configuration would be n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1), n=4 (1). Wait, no, that's four particles. So the energy would be 2E +4E +9E +16E=31E. But that's higher than 18E.

Alternatively, maybe after the first excited state (15E), the next state is when a particle is promoted from n=2 to n=4, making energy 2E +4E +16E =22E. Still not matching.

Wait, what if the first excited state is when two particles are in n=2 and one in n=3? No, because n=2 can only hold two. So that's not possible.

Wait, maybe I'm missing that after filling n=1 and n=2, the next state is when two particles are in n=3, but that would require removing two from n=2 and putting them in n=3. So the configuration would be two in n=1, two in n=3. So the energy would be 2E + 2*9E=20E.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct option is not present. But the options must have an answer.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. It says "energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system".

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the energy levels not as the sum of all particles' energies, but perhaps the individual energies of the particles, but that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps the question is about the energy levels for each particle, but no, the question says the energies of the system.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the particles are spin-1/2, so their spin can be considered part of the quantum numbers. So for each n, two possible spin states (up and down), so each n can hold two particles.

Four particles would fill n=1 (two) and n=2 (two), giving a total energy of 10E.

The first excited state would be when two particles are in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3 → energy 2E +4E +9E=15E.

The second excited state would be when two are in n=1, two in n=3 → 2E + 2*9E=20E.

But again, the options don't have 20E. So perhaps the options are considering another approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the fermions as having to occupy different n's because perhaps the spin is not considered part of the state. Wait, but in a 1D box, the wavefunction is determined by n and spin. So each n can hold two particles (spin up and down). So for four particles, n=1 (2), n=2 (2). So the ground state is 10E.

Looking at the options, option D has ground state 10E, first excited 15E, second 18E.

So where does 18E come from?

Ah, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4. Wait, let me calculate that.

If two in n=1, one in n=3, and one in n=4 → energy 2E +9E +16E=27E. No, that's not 18E.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=2 and two in n=3 → 2*(4E) +2*(9E) =8E +18E=26E. Still not matching.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=4 and another to n=3. So energy would be 2E +4E +9E +16E=31E. No, that's way higher.

Wait, maybe I'm missing that the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and zero in n=2. So two in n=1, two in n=3 → 2E + 18E=20E.

But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when a particle is promoted to n=4, so two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4. That would give 2E +4E +16E=22E.

Still not matching any option. I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about fermions. Wait, no, the question says spin-1/2 particles, which are fermions. So the Pauli exclusion applies.

Wait, maybe the particles are in a symmetric state, but I don't think that's relevant here.

Wait, let's think differently. Maybe the question is not about the sum of energies but about the individual energies. No, that doesn't make sense.

Another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the ground state, first, and second excited states in terms of each particle's energy, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps each particle's energy is considered individually, and the question is about the possible energy levels for the system, but again, that's unclear.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look at the options again.

Option D says the energies are 10E,15E,18E. So perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and one in n=2. Let's see:

n=1: two → 2E,

n=2: one →4E,

n=3: two →2*9E=18E.

Wait, no, that's 2E +4E +18E=24E.

Hmm, but that's not matching.

Alternatively, if two particles are in n=3 and one in n=2 and one in n=1, but that's four particles.

Wait, n=1: two (2E),

n=2: one (4E),

n=3: one (9E).

That's 2E +4E +9E=15E, which is the first excited state.

Wait, but that's the same as before. So the second excited state must be higher than that.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4. So configuration is two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4. So energy is 2E +4E +16E=22E. But 22E isn't in any option, so I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem considers that the ground state is when the particles are in n=1, n=1, n=2, n=2, which is 10E. The first excited state is three in n=1 and one in n=3. Wait, no, because n=1 can only hold two.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me think about what the options are.

Looking at option D: 10E,15E,18E.

So ground state is 10E.

First excited state is15E.

Second excited state is18E.

How can 18E be achieved?

Ah! Wait, 18E could be when two particles are in n=3 (each 9E), so 2*9E=18E, but no, because that's just the energy from those two, but the other two are in n=1 and n=2.

Wait, no, the total would be 2E (n=1) + 4E (n=2) + 2*9E (n=3) → 2E+4E+18E=24E. That's not matching.

Wait another idea: perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=4. That would be 2*9E + 2*16E=18E+32E=50E. But that's way higher than 18E.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the way the states are filled. Maybe the first excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, and another is promoted from n=2 to n=4. So the configuration is two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3, one in n=4. But that's five particles, which is more than four. So that can't be right.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the particles are arranged in a way where the first excited state is when two particles are in n=2 and two in n=3. So the configuration is two in n=2 (each 4E) and two in n=3 (each 9E). So the total energy is 2*(4E) + 2*(9E) =8E +18E=26E. But that's not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and one in n=4, making the configuration two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3, and one in n=4. But that's five particles. So no.

I think I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again. Option D's second excited state is 18E. How can 18E be achieved?

Wait, 18E is 2*9E, which would mean two particles in n=3. So perhaps the configuration is two in n=1, two in n=3 → energy 2E + 2*9E=20E. But that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4. So 2E (n=1) +4E (n=2) +16E (n=4)=22E. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is 15E, and the second is 18E, which would be when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4. But that's 9E +16E=25E, but 2E+4E+25E=31E. No.

Hmm, maybe the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=4. But that's 2*9E + 2*16E=18E+32E=50E. Which is option A's third option.

But I'm not making progress here. Perhaps I should pick the option that matches the ground state I thought, 10E. Looking at the options, only D and B have 10E as the ground state or first state. Option D has 10E as the ground state, so that's likely correct.

So the ground state is 10E (option D's first option). The first excited state is 15E (their second option), which would be moving one particle to n=3. The second excited state in option D is 18E, which I'm not sure how to get. But maybe the second excited state is when two particles are promoted to n=3, but that would require two in n=3, so 2*9E=18E. So the system's energy would be 2E (n=1) +2*9E=2E+18E=20E. But option D's second excited state is 18E. So maybe I'm not adding correctly.

Wait, perhaps the system's energy is only the sum of the energies of the particles in higher n's beyond the ground state. But no, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4. So the configuration is two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4. So the energy would be 2E +4E +16E=22E. But none of the options have that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering spin and each n can only hold one particle. But that can't be right for spin-1/2.

Alternatively, perhaps the particles are bosons, but the question says spin-1/2, which are fermions.

I'm stuck, but based on the options, option D has the ground state at 10E, which I think is correct, and the first excited state at 15E, which makes sense. The second excited state is 18E, which I'm not exactly sure about, but perhaps the calculation is different.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the way the particles are arranged in the excited states depends on the order of possible energy promotions.

Ground state: n=1(2), n=2(2) → 10E.

First excited state: move one from n=2 to n=3 → n=1(2), n=2(1), n=3(1). Energy 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Second excited state: move another from n=2 to n=3 → n=1(2), n=3(2). So energy 2E + 2*9E=2E+18E=20E. But option D shows 18E as the second excited state. So perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3, which is 18E, but the sum would be 2E +18E=20E. But the option shows 18E as the second excited state's energy. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding what the question is asking.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the energy of each particle, but that doesn't make sense because the total energy would still require summing.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the individual energies of each particle and the question is about the possible energy levels for each particle, but no, the question says "energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system".

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the energy levels in a different way. Let me think: the energy levels are filled as n=1 (2 particles), n=2 (2), n=3 (2), etc. So the ground state is 10E, first excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3 (15E), and the second excited state is when another is promoted to n=3 (20E). But the option D has 18E as the second.

Hmm, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=4, giving 16E. So the configuration would be two in n=1 (2E), one in n=2 (4E), and one in n=4 (16E). So the total is 2E +4E +16E=22E. But that's not matching.

I'm really stuck here, but based on the options, and the fact that option D's ground state is 10E, which I'm confident is correct, and the first excited state is 15E, I'll go with option D as the answer.


To solve the problem, we analyze the energy levels of four identical spin-1/2 fermions in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The energy levels for a single particle are given by:

\[
E_n = n^2 E, \quad \text{where } E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2}.
\]

Since the particles are fermions, they obey the Pauli exclusion principle, meaning no two particles can occupy the same quantum state. Each energy level \( n \) can hold two particles due to the spin-1/2 nature of the particles (spin-up and spin-down states).

### Ground State
In the ground state, the particles fill the lowest available energy levels. The lowest two levels, \( n=1 \) and \( n=2 \), each hold two particles:
- Two particles in \( n=1 \): Total energy contribution = \( 2 \cdot E = 2E \),
- Two particles in \( n=2 \): Total energy contribution = \( 2 \cdot 4E = 8E \).

Thus, the total energy of the ground state is:
\[
E_{\text{ground}} = 2E + 8E = 10E.
\]

### First Excited State
In the first excited state, one particle is promoted from \( n=2 \) to \( n=3 \). The configuration becomes:
- Two particles in \( n=1 \): Total energy contribution = \( 2E \),
- One particle in \( n=2 \): Total energy contribution = \( 4E \),
- One particle in \( n=3 \): Total energy contribution = \( 9E \).

Thus, the total energy of the first excited state is:
\[
E_{\text{first excited}} = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.
\]

### Second Excited State
In the second excited state, another particle is promoted from \( n=2 \) to \( n=3 \). The configuration becomes:
- Two particles in \( n=1 \): Total energy contribution = \( 2E \),
- Two particles in \( n=3 \): Total energy contribution = \( 2 \cdot 9E = 18E \).

Thus, the total energy of the second excited state is:
\[
E_{\text{second excited}} = 2E + 18E = 20E.
\]

### Matching with Options
From the calculations:
- Ground state energy = \( 10E \),
- First excited state energy = \( 15E \),
- Second excited state energy = \( 20E \).

However, none of the options explicitly include \( 20E \) for the second excited state. Among the given options, **Option D** has the closest match:
- Ground state = \( 10E \),
- First excited state = \( 15E \),
- Second excited state = \( 18E \).

While \( 18E \) does not exactly match the calculated \( 20E \), it is the most reasonable choice based on the provided options.

### Final Answer
The correct option is:

**Answer: D**
