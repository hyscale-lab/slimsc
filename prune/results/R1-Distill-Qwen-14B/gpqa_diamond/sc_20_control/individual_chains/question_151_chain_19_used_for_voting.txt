Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so let me think through it. The question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable, P, and getting the value 0. The system's state is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). The matrix P is given, and I need to calculate the probability.

Wait, first, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices, right? Because their eigenvalues are real, which makes sense for measurements. So I should check if P is Hermitian. Looking at P, the first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). The second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So the transpose of P would have the same elements, because the non-diagonal elements are symmetric. So P is symmetric, which means it's Hermitian since all the elements are real. Good.

Next, the state of the system is a column vector, let's call it |ψ⟩. So |ψ⟩ is a 3-dimensional vector with components (-1, 2, 1). I think the first step is to normalize this vector, because probabilities depend on the norm. Wait, but wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vector must be normalized, meaning the sum of the squares of the absolute values of its components should be 1. So let's calculate the norm here.

The components are -1, 2, and 1. So their squares are 1, 4, and 1. Summing them gives 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). Therefore, the normalized state would be (1/sqrt(6)) times the vector (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, but wait, does the problem give the state as already normalized? Because sometimes in problems, the state is given without normalization. Let me check the question again. Oh, the state is given as (-1, 2, 1), but it doesn't specify being normalized. So I think we need to normalize it before proceeding because probabilities are calculated with the normalized state vector.

So the normalized state vector |ψ⟩ is (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. Or wait, is it possible that the state isn't normalized in the problem? Because sometimes problems are set where the state is given as non-normalized, and you're supposed to account for that. So that's something to remember.

Now, the observable P is given. To find the probability of measuring 0, I think I need to find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of P. Because the possible outcomes of a measurement are the eigenvalues, and the probability is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state.

Wait, right. So first, let's find the eigenvalues of P. Because the eigenvalues will give the possible outcomes when measuring P. Then, we can see if 0 is one of them. If it is, then the probability is the square of the component (amplitude) of the eigenvector corresponding to 0 in the state vector.

So let's write down P again:

P = [
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
[1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
]

Hmm, wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check. Wait, the first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So rows are symmetric, as I thought earlier.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to find the eigenvalues by noting that P is a symmetric matrix, so it's diagonalizable, and its eigenvectors are orthogonal.

Alternatively, perhaps to find the trace and determinant to find the eigenvalues. The trace is 0 + 0 + 0 = 0. The determinant would give the product of the eigenvalues, and the trace is the sum. So the sum of eigenvalues is zero.

Let me try to find the eigenvalues. The characteristic equation is det(P - λ I) = 0.

The matrix P - λ I is:

[
[-λ, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
[1/sqrt(2), -λ, 1/sqrt(2)],
[0, 1/sqrt(2), -λ]
]

So the determinant should be:

| -λ       1/√2       0       |
| 1/√2    -λ       1/√2     |
| 0       1/√2    -λ        |

Let me compute this determinant. Maybe using expansion by minors.

The determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be calculated as:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] 
- (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (0)(1/√2) ] 
+ 0 * [ ... ]

Wait, no. Let me see, perhaps I should write out the determinant step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps using the rule for 3x3 determinants:

a(ei − fh) − b(di − fg) + c(dh − eg)

Where the matrix is:
[a b c]
[d e f]
[g h i]

In this case:

a = -λ, b=1/√2, c=0
d=1/√2, e=-λ, f=1/√2
g=0, h=1/√2, i=-λ

So determinant = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)

Let's compute each term:

a(ei - fh) = (-λ) [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] 
= (-λ) [ λ² - (1/2) ]

Then, -b(di - fg) = -(1/√2) [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (0)(1/√2) ) ]
= -(1/√2) [ (-λ/√2) - 0 )
= -(1/√2)(-λ/√2)
= -(1/√2) * (-λ/√2) = (λ)/(2)

And c(dh - eg) = 0 [ ... ] = 0

So overall determinant is:

(-λ)(λ² - 1/2) + (λ/2)

Set determinant = 0:

(-λ)(λ² - 1/2) + (λ/2) = 0

Factor out λ:

λ [ -(λ² - 1/2) + 1/2 ] = 0

So either λ = 0, or the term in brackets is zero.

Let's compute the term in brackets:

-(λ² - 1/2) + 1/2 = -λ² + 1/2 + 1/2 = -λ² + 1

Set this equal to zero:

-λ² +1 =0 → λ²=1 → λ=1 or λ=-1.

So the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the calculations again, because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, after factoring:

det(P - λ I) = λ [ -(λ² -1/2) + 1/2 ] = λ [ -λ² +1/2 + 1/2 ] = λ [ -λ² + 1 ].

So setting this equal to zero gives:

λ (-λ² +1) =0 → λ=0, or (-λ² +1)=0 → λ²=1 → λ=1 or -1.

Yes, so the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1.

So the possible outcomes when measuring P are 0, 1, and -1.

So the question is the probability of getting 0. So we need to find the eigenvector corresponding to λ=0, and then compute the projection of the state vector onto that eigenvector.

So first, let's find the eigenvector for λ=0.

We solve (P - 0 I) v = 0 → P v = 0.

So the system is:

0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → (1/√2) v2 = 0 → v2=0.

Second equation: (1/√2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 → (1/√2)(v1 + v3) )=0 → v1 + v3=0 → v3 = -v1.

Third equation: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 =0 → same as first equation, which gives v2=0.

So the eigenvectors are of the form (v1, 0, -v1). So we can write this as v1*(1, 0, -1).

To make this a unit vector, we need to normalize it. The norm of (1,0,-1) is sqrt(1² + 0 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). So the eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2)) (1, 0, -1).

So the eigenvector for λ=0 is |v⟩ = (1, 0, -1)^T / sqrt(2).

Now, the state vector is |ψ⟩ = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T / sqrt(6), as we normalized earlier.

The probability of measuring 0 is the square of the amplitude of the eigenvector |v⟩ in |ψ⟩. So the amplitude is the inner product ⟨v | ψ⟩.

So let's compute ⟨v | ψ⟩.

⟨v | is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

⟨v | ψ⟩ = (1/sqrt(2))*(-1/sqrt(6)) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(6)).

Let me compute each term:

First term: (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) = (-1)/(sqrt(12)).

Second term: 0.

Third term: (-1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) )= (-1)/(sqrt(12)).

So sum is (-1/sqrt(12)) + (-1/sqrt(12)) = (-2)/sqrt(12) = (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) )= (-1)/sqrt(3).

The amplitude is (-1)/sqrt(3).

The probability is the square of the absolute value: (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.

Wait, but wait a minute. The state |ψ⟩ is ( -1, 2, 1 )^T / sqrt(6). So when I take the inner product, the first term is (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) which is (-1)/(sqrt(12)).

Similarly, the third term is ( -1/sqrt(2) ) * (1/sqrt(6)) ) = (-1)/(sqrt(12)).

So adding those two gives (-2)/(sqrt(12)), which is same as (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) )= (-1)/sqrt(3). So the amplitude is (-1/sqrt(3)).

The probability is the square of the absolute value, which is (1/3).

So the probability is 1/3. So the correct option is C) 1/3.

To determine the probability of measuring the observable \( P \) and obtaining the value \( 0 \), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Normalize the state vector
The state of the system is given as \( | \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \). To normalize it, we calculate the norm:
\[
\| | \psi \rangle \| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]
Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
| \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Find the eigenvalues of \( P \)
The observable \( P \) is represented by the matrix:
\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
To find the eigenvalues, we solve the characteristic equation \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \). The determinant is:
\[
\det(P - \lambda I) = -\lambda \left( \lambda^2 - \frac{1}{2} \right) + \frac{\lambda}{2}.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\lambda \left( -\lambda^2 + 1 \right) = 0.
\]
Thus, the eigenvalues are:
\[
\lambda = 0, \, 1, \, -1.
\]

### Step 3: Find the eigenvector for \( \lambda = 0 \)
For \( \lambda = 0 \), we solve \( P | v \rangle = 0 \). This gives the system:
\[
\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v_2 = 0, \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (v_1 + v_3) = 0, \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v_2 = 0.
\end{cases}
\]
From the first equation, \( v_2 = 0 \). From the second equation, \( v_1 = -v_3 \). Thus, the eigenvector is:
\[
| v \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 4: Compute the probability of measuring \( 0 \)
The probability of measuring \( 0 \) is the square of the amplitude of \( | v \rangle \) in \( | \psi \rangle \). The amplitude is:
\[
\langle v | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
Calculating:
\[
\langle v | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} (-1) + \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} (-1) = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]
The probability is the square of the absolute value:
\[
P(0) = \left| \langle v | \psi \rangle \right|^2 = \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probability of measuring \( 0 \) is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
