Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light propagating through a moving glass medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says a light beam is going through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I'm supposed to find the speed of the light relative to the observer in the lab. The options are given as A, B, C, D, and I need to pick the right one.

Wait, so I remember that when a medium is moving, the speed of light within it doesn't just simply add up with the medium's velocity. Oh right, because the speed of light in a medium is c/n, where c is the vacuum speed. But when the medium is moving, do I just add the velocities?

Wait, no, that's probably incorrect because velocities in relativity don't just add linearly. Oh wait, but this is a non-relativistic case, I think. Because if v is much smaller than c, maybe we can use classical addition. Or is there a relativistic effect here?

But the problem states the speed of light in vacuum is c=1. So I think it's set in a non-relativistic framework, because in relativity, c is always constant regardless of the medium's motion. Wait, but in this scenario, the glass is a medium moving relative to the lab, and the light is inside the glass. Hmm.

Wait, but in reality, the speed of light in a medium is c/n, and that speed is measured in the rest frame of the medium. So if the medium is moving with velocity v relative to the lab, what would the lab measure as the speed of light?

Wait, but light's speed isn't just additive. Oh, I think the velocity of the light relative to the lab would be the velocity of the medium plus the velocity of light in the medium. But wait, that's only if the velocities are small compared to c, so non-relativistic addition applies.

Wait, so the speed of light in the glass (from the glass's frame) is c/n. So the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. So the lab would measure the light's velocity as (v + c/n) ?

Wait, but the problem is asking for the speed, not the velocity. Oh no, wait, the question says "speed of light in glass relative to the observer". Hmm, no, wait, more accurately, the speed of light within the glass as observed in the lab frame. So let's think in terms of velocity addition.

In the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at c/n in the same direction as the glass's motion. The glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. So how do we transform velocities?

Wait, in the glass's frame, the light's velocity is u' = c/n. The lab frame is moving at velocity v relative to the glass. But wait, the direction matters. So if the glass is moving towards the observer (so in the lab frame, the glass is moving in the direction of light), then the light's velocity in the lab frame would be u = u' + v, but only if u' and v are in the same direction.

Wait, no. Wait, according to the classical velocity addition formula, if you have a velocity u' in a frame S', which is moving at velocity v relative to S, then the velocity u in S is u = u' + v. But that's when the motion is along the same axis. So in this case, in the glass frame, the light is moving at u' = c/n in the same direction as the glass's motion. Then in the lab frame, the speed would be u = u' + v = (c/n) + v.

But wait, c is 1 here, so u = (1/n) + v. But none of the options directly match that. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: (1 + n v)/(n + v)
Option B: 1
Option C: (1 +n v)/(n -v)
Option D: (1 -n v)/(n +v)

Hmm, none of these look like (1/n) + v.

Wait, maybe I got the frame transformation wrong. Maybe the problem is considering a different approach, like relativistic velocity addition.

Wait, let's think about relativity. So in the glass's frame, the light is moving at u' = c/n (since in the glass, speed is c/n). The glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. So using the relativistic velocity addition formula, u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c²).

But wait, since c is 1, that becomes u = (u' + v)/(1 + u' v).

So substituting u' = 1/n, we get u = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (1/n) v ).

Hmm, let's compute that. Let me factor out 1/n from numerator and denominator.

Wait, the numerator is (1/n + v) which is (1 + n v)/n.

Denominator is 1 + (v/n) = (n + v)/n.

So u = [ (1 + n v)/n ] / [ (n + v)/n ] = (1 + n v)/(n + v).

Wait, that's exactly option A.

Oh, so I think the correct answer is option A.

Wait, but why did I initially think about classical addition and then switched to relativity? Because the problem says "Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1." So perhaps the problem expects a relativistic solution, but I'm a bit confused because in the case where v is much smaller than c, the relativistic addition would approach the classical (u ≈ (1/n +v) ), but the options don't have that. So the only option that matches the relativistic formula is option A.

So the answer should be option A.

To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation using relativistic velocity addition. The light beam propagates through the glass medium, which has an index of refraction \( n \). In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is \( c/n \), where \( c = 1 \) (given). The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam and toward the observer.

Using the relativistic velocity addition formula, the speed of light in the lab frame is given by:

\[
u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' v}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u' = c/n = 1/n \) is the speed of light in the glass's rest frame, and \( c = 1 \). Substituting \( u' = 1/n \) into the formula, we get:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
\]

Simplify the numerator and denominator:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1 + n v}{n}}{\frac{n + v}{n}} = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches option A. Therefore, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is:

\[
\frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]
