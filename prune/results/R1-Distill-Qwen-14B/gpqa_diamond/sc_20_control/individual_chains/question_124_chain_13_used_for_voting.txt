Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles in a detector. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The problem says that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These new particles are fast-decaying and travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters. The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls.

Hmm. I remember that the Lorentz factor gamma relates to time dilation and length contraction in special relativity. Since the particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, their lifetime as measured in the lab frame would be longer than their proper lifetime due to time dilation. But wait, wait, no, actually, the particles are decaying, so their lifetime is important here.

Wait, decay length. Oh right! The decay length is the average distance a particle travels before decaying. So if a particle has a mean proper lifetime τ (tau), then in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma times tau. So the distance it travels before decaying is velocity multiplied by gamma tau. Since the velocity is close to the speed of light, we can approximate it as c multiplied by gamma tau. So decay length L ≈ c * gamma * tau.

In the original scenario, the detector's radius is 30 meters, and one third of the particles reach the inner walls. That means the decay length for gamma=20 is such that one third of the particles decay within 30 meters. Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the fraction that reach the walls based on their decay length.

I think the fraction that reach the walls depends on the decay length compared to the detector's radius. So, the probability that a particle decays before reaching the wall is given by 1 - e^(-R/L), where R is the radius and L is the decay length. So the fraction that reach the wall is e^(-R/L), because that's the probability that decay hasn't happened yet.

So in the given scenario, with gamma=20, one third reach the walls. So fraction reaching walls is 1/3, which is e^(-R/(gamma c tau)).

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me write down the equations.

Let me denote the decay length as L = gamma * beta * c * tau. Since beta is approximately 1 for ultra-relativistic particles, L ≈ gamma * c * tau.

The probability that a particle doesn't decay before traveling a distance R is P = e^(-R/L) = e^(-R/(gamma c tau)).

In the original case, with gamma=20, P = 1/3. So,

1/3 = e^(-30/(20 c tau)).

We can take the natural log of both sides:

ln(1/3) = -30/(20 c tau).

ln(1/3) is negative, so:

- ln(3) = -30/(20 c tau).

Which simplifies to:

ln(3) = 30/(20 c tau).

So 30/(20 c tau) = ln(3).

Wait, but I think I'm missing something here. Because if gamma is 20, then L = gamma * c tau. So 30/(gamma c tau) = 30/(20 c tau) = 0.15 / (c tau).

Wait, but actually, maybe I should keep things in terms of variables for now. Let's proceed.

So, from the first case, we have:

ln(3) = 30/(20 c tau) → 30/(20 c tau) = ln(3).

Let me solve for c tau:

c tau = 30/(20 ln(3)).

Simplify 30/20 → 3/2. So c tau = (3/2) / ln(3).

Now, the question is asking for the gamma needed so that the fraction reaching the walls is two-thirds.

So in the new case, P = 2/3.

So:

2/3 = e^(-30/(gamma c tau)).

Take ln of both sides:

ln(2/3) = -30/(gamma c tau).

Multiply both sides by -1:

- ln(2/3) = 30/(gamma c tau).

But wait, ln(2/3) is negative. So:

ln(2/3) = - (30/(gamma c tau)).

So, 30/(gamma c tau) = - ln(2/3).

But wait, that would make 30/(gamma c tau) positive because the right side is positive. Let's compute the value:

ln(2/3) = ln(2) - ln(3) ≈ 0.6931 - 1.0986 ≈ -0.4055.

So, the absolute value is 0.4055. So,

30/(gamma c tau) = 0.4055.

But from the first scenario, we know that 30/(20 c tau) = ln(3) ≈ 1.0986.

Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that:

Wait, wait a second. Let me think again.

From the first case:

We had P = 1/3 = e^(-30/(gamma c tau)).

So, taking natural logs:

ln(1/3) = -30/(gamma c tau).

So,

30/(gamma c tau) = - ln(1/3) = ln(3) ≈1.0986.

In the second case, we have P=2/3.

So,

ln(2/3) = -30/(gamma_new c tau).

Which rearranges to:

30/(gamma_new c tau) = - ln(2/3) = ln(3/2) ≈0.4055.

So,

gamma_new = 30 c tau / (0.4055).

But from the first case,

30/(20 c tau) = ln(3) → 30 c tau = 20 * ln(3) / (1) → 30 c tau = 20 * 1.0986 ≈ 21.972.

Wait, wait no: 30/(20 c tau) = ln(3) → 30=20 c tau * ln(3) → 20 c tau = 30 / ln(3) → c tau = 30/(20 ln(3)).

So, c tau = 3/(2 ln(3)).

So, c tau ≈ 3/(2 * 1.0986) ≈ 3/(2.1972) ≈1.3655 meters.

Now, back to the second case: 30/(gamma_new c tau) = 0.4055 → gamma_new c tau = 30 / 0.4055 → gamma_new c tau ≈74.005.

But c tau is about 1.3655, so gamma_new = (30 / 0.4055) ) / (c tau) ?

Wait, no. Let me correct that. From the second case:

30/(gamma_new * c tau) = 0.4055.

So,

gamma_new * c tau = 30 / 0.4055 ≈74.005.

We already know that c tau is 30/(20 ln(3)).

So, substituting c tau into the equation:

gamma_new * (30/(20 ln(3))) ) =74.005.

So, gamma_new = (74.005 * 20 ln(3)) /30.

Let me compute that.

Compute 74.005 *20 = 1480.1.

ln(3)≈1.0986.

1480.1 *1.0986 ≈ 1623.3.

Divide by 30: 1623.3 /30 ≈54.11.

So gamma_new is approximately 54.11. Looking at the options, option A is 54, option B is 68, C is40, D is28. So the closest is A)54.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the calculations because approximations could have thrown me off.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a better way to relate the two cases.

In the first case, gamma1 =20, and the fraction P1=1/3.

In the second case, gamma2=gamma_new, P2=2/3.

We can write:

P = e^(-R/(gamma c tau)).

So for the first case:

1/3 = e^(-30/(20 c tau)) → ln(1/3) = -30/(20 c tau).

For the second case:

2/3 = e^(-30/(gamma2 c tau)) → ln(2/3) = -30/(gamma2 c tau).

So, if I take the ratio of the two equations:

[ln(2/3)] / [ln(1/3)] = [30/(gamma2 c tau)] / [30/(20 c tau)].

Simplify:

[ln(2/3)/ln(1/3)] = (20) / gamma2.

Compute the left side:

ln(2/3) = ln(2) - ln(3) ≈0.6931 -1.0986 ≈-0.4055.

ln(1/3) = -ln(3)≈-1.0986.

So,

(-0.4055)/(-1.0986) = 0.4055/1.0986 ≈0.369.

So,

0.369 ≈20/gamma2 → gamma2 ≈20 /0.369 ≈54.23.

So approximately 54.23, which aligns with option A, 54.

So the answer should be A)54.

To determine the Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector's inner walls, we analyze the relationship between the decay length, the detector's radius, and the Lorentz factor. The decay length is given by \( L = \gamma \cdot c \cdot \tau \), where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( c \) is the speed of light, and \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle. The probability that a particle reaches the detector's inner walls is \( P = e^{-R/L} \), where \( R \) is the detector's radius.

### Step 1: Analyze the given scenario
For the initial case:
- \( \gamma_1 = 20 \),
- \( P_1 = \frac{1}{3} \),
- \( R = 30 \, \text{m} \).

Using \( P = e^{-R/L} \), we have:
\[
\frac{1}{3} = e^{-30/(\gamma_1 \cdot c \cdot \tau)}.
\]
Taking the natural logarithm:
\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{30}{\gamma_1 \cdot c \cdot \tau}.
\]
\[
-\ln(3) = -\frac{30}{20 \cdot c \cdot \tau}.
\]
Simplify:
\[
\ln(3) = \frac{30}{20 \cdot c \cdot \tau}.
\]
\[
c \cdot \tau = \frac{30}{20 \cdot \ln(3)}.
\]

### Step 2: Relate to the new scenario
For the second case:
- \( P_2 = \frac{2}{3} \),
- \( \gamma_2 \) is unknown.

Using \( P = e^{-R/L} \) again:
\[
\frac{2}{3} = e^{-30/(\gamma_2 \cdot c \cdot \tau)}.
\]
Taking the natural logarithm:
\[
\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{30}{\gamma_2 \cdot c \cdot \tau}.
\]
\[
-\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{30}{\gamma_2 \cdot c \cdot \tau}.
\]
From the first case, \( c \cdot \tau = \frac{30}{20 \cdot \ln(3)} \). Substituting this into the second equation:
\[
\frac{30}{\gamma_2 \cdot c \cdot \tau} = \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right).
\]
\[
\frac{30}{\gamma_2 \cdot \left(\frac{30}{20 \cdot \ln(3)}\right)} = \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right).
\]
Simplify:
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{30}{\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{30}{20 \cdot \ln(3)}\right)}.
\]
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{20 \cdot \ln(3)}{\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)}.
\]

### Step 3: Numerical calculation
Using approximate values:
\[
\ln(3) \approx 1.0986, \quad \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) \approx 0.4055.
\]
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{20 \cdot 1.0986}{0.4055} \approx 54.11.
\]

### Conclusion
The Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector's inner walls is approximately \( \gamma_2 = 54 \). Comparing this to the options, the closest match is **A) 54**.
